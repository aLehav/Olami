The College of Fine Arts is now the College 
of the Arts, but students wonder if the degree will be just as ﬁ  ne.
The change is designed to reﬂ  ect a more 
encompassing name for all of the programs 
under the college, said Leah Craig, the public relations and marketing manager for the Col-lege of the Arts.
“‘Fine’ no longer represents the college as it 
used to,” she said.  
“It’s not just visual arts,” Craig said. “Now 
we have music, dance, theater and digital arts programs.”
The College of the Arts houses the School of 
Art and Art History, School of Music, School of Theatre and Dance, the UF Center for Arts in Medicine, Center for World Arts, Digital Worlds Institute and University Galleries. 
Adreenah Wynn, a 20-year-old UF art and 
technology junior, said she prefers “College of Fine Arts” over the new title.

When Gildas Dousset received his tuition bill, 
it was nearly four times as high as it was supposed 
to be.
As the spouse of a long-time Florida resident, 
Dousset expected to pay Florida Atlantic Univer-sity’s in-state tuition rate of $199.54 per credit hour but was charged the out-of-state rate of $718.09.
The 30-year-old FAU journalism and political 
science student appealed the university’s decision last week after it refused to recognize his Massa-chusetts marriage and grant him in-state tuition.
Dousset is arguing that the state laws banning 
recognition of homosexual marriages violate the U.S. Constitution, according the National Center for Lesbian Rights.
Dousset’s lawyer, George Castrataro, said the 
case will be likely be heard by the fourth district court of appeals in the late summer or early fall.
If the basis for the court’s judgement is that the 
statutes are unconstitutional, the case could set an important precedent for homosexuals that would extend far beyond campus borders.
“The case could have far-reaching implica-
tions,” said Joseph Jackson, associate director of the Center on Children & Families at UF Levin College of Law. 
The constitutionality of Florida’s same-sex 
marriage ban is currently being challenged by a couple from Miami as well, Jackson said. 
“We’re not really challenging FAU,” Castrataro 
said. “We’re more challenging the rule itself.”
FAU issued a statement defending the out-of-
state tuition charge.
“The lawsuit challenges Florida statute 741.212 
that was signed into law in 1997. It requires that no state agency, including state universities, can FAU student

Gainesville Police arrested a man af-
ter he ran from ofﬁ  cers and threw a 1.4-
gram tube of cocaine to the side of the road, ofﬁ  cials said. 
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 39-year-old Bobby 
Harris on Tuesday on charges of cocaine possession, drug equipment possession and resisting arrest, according to a po-lice report. 
At about 9 p.m., GPD responded to a 
burglary on Northwest Fourth Avenue. As an ofﬁ  cer arrived, Harris was found riding his bicycle down the street. When ofﬁ  cers stepped out of the 
car, Harris immediately took off on his bicycle southbound on Northwest 12th Street, according to the report.  
Ofﬁ  cers ran after him while shouting 
at him to stop.   
As he was ﬂ  eeing, Harris threw sev-
eral items, including a white cup. 
After combing the area, ofﬁ  cers 
found a white tube containing a hard substance about 10 feet from Harris’ ar-rest, according to the report. 
About eight pieces of crack cocaine 
were found inside the white tube, which weighed about 1.4 grams, according to the report. However, ofﬁ  cers did not ﬁ  nd any related objects on Harris to show he was using the items. 
After questioning, Harris said he 
became scared when ofﬁ  cers initially arrived and ﬂ  ed from the area while throwing the items. 
Harris said he was given a white 
cup, the white tube containing cocaine, a lighter and a cigar, according to the report.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Harris into the Ala-
chua County Jail at about midnight. As of press time, his bond is set at $25,000. GPD arrests man who runs, throws cocaine New name is more inclusive

found out about it through 
email or a newsletter. I only found out through Facebook,” Wynn said. “I wish we had more input.”
She is also concerned about 
how the name change will af-fect her degree. 
“The ‘fine’ in fine arts is very 
prestigious,” Wynn said. She said she thinks that “fine arts” caters to a specific type of disci-pline and sees “the arts” as too general.
Ivette De Santiago, a 20-
year-old UF art and technology junior, is also concerned about how the change will be reflect-ed on her diploma. She doesn’t see the name change having a direct effect on students.
“As long as it doesn’t affect 
the curriculum, I don’t think it will change what will happen in the classroom,” she said.
 She said she fully supported 
the more inclusive nature of the new title.
“When you think of fine 
arts, you think of painters, illus-trators, drawers,” De Santiago said. “You don’t think of danc-ers or musicians.”
Craig said the name change 
will come slowly, but students should start seeing changes happening very soon, par-ticularly over the Summer and Fall, with changes in building names, websites, brochures and other literature.
Students like Wynn don’t 
see immediate change coming either. She said she thinks that it will probably take at least a year for her and her peers to even start saying College of the Arts.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 22, 2014

� UF ALREADY HAS A 
SMALL TEAM.

More classes focusing on how 
computers relate to and read hu-
mans are on the way for UF stu-dents. 
UF hired four former Clemson University computer scientists to work in the Department of Com-puter and Information Science and Engineering in the College of Engi-neering. 
They specialize in human-cen-
tered computing, which is any in-teraction between a computer and a human in which the computer adapts to the user. Think Pokémon video games— players’ progress is greatly determined by the Pokémon they catch, the people they meet and the places they go, which will rarely be the same as someone else’s.
Benjamin Lok, associate profes-
sor and director of the Digital Arts and Science Program, said the team will allow the school to offer many benefits to students, including re-search and new courses.
“They’re going to get a variety of 
classes that we just can’t offer right now,” Lok said.Wilson Lam, a 20-year-old UF 
biological engineering junior, said that he would be interested in taking a course with the new faculty.
“I think new faculty will bring 
different ways of thinking,” Lam said.
He said he would like to see pro-
grams that interact with students as part of the initiatives.
“It’s just another way of learn-
ing,” Lam said.Currently, there are three mem-
bers on UF’s human-centered com-puting team. The new team will re-search how to improve interactions between humans and computers.
Lok said he welcomes the expan-
sion and the ability to do large proj-ects with more faculty.
“It’s really going to allow us to 
offer more classes to students and to do large research projects that are on a national scale,” Lok said.

recognize same-sex marriages.”
According to the statute, “Mar-
riages between persons of the same 
sex... are not recognized for any pur-pose in this state.”
Although she considers herself an activist for LGBTQ+ issues, 21-year-old FAU neuroscience senior Elaina Gombos said she thinks FAU was following the law when it refused Dousset’s in-state tuition, not mak-ing a moral call.
“Everybody should have the 
benefit of being married anywhere they go,” Gombos said. “But I think that FAU might have had its hands tied.”
Although they are called “domes-
tic partners,” homosexual spouses of UF students are entitled to spousal care from the Student Health Care Center and are eligible for spouse football tickets, according to univer-sity regulations. But to get in-state tuition through a same-sex spouse, state laws will have to change.
“It’s one of those things that 
makes where we are in marriage equality really complicated,” said L.B. Hannahs, director of UF LGBT affairs. 
Hannahs said because some 
states recognize LGBT marriages and others do not, issues are bound to come up as couples cross state lines. This case “is indicative of how messy this process is and is going to continue to be.”

Don’t delete any selfies from 
the boardwalk at Loblolly Woods 
Nature Park because you may have to wait about five months to snap another one.
Gainesville Parks, Recreation 
and Cultural Affairs recently closed the boardwalk for renova-tions after years of complaints of safety hazards and loose boards. 
To keep citizens away from the 
construction site, barricades have been placed in front of the entranc-es, and signs direct park visitors to an alternative detour route. 
The detour route, Mason Manor 
boardwalk, is located at Northwest 25th Street. Linda Demetropoulos, nature and cultural manager for Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs, said walkers and joggers from Eighth to 16th Av-enues can still use this path.   “The decking boards were in dis-repair,” she said.
Steve Phillips, director of 
Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs, said one reason for the reconstruction is the decreasing life expectancy of the wood pan-els that make up the boardwalk. The wetland areas tend to expe-rience weathering and therefore require frequent maintenance and replacement. 
“This is something we need to 
address because it’s a park for ac-cess,” Phillips said.  
Katelyn Zanchetta, a 21-year-
old UF health education and be-havior science senior, said she was disappointed when she saw that the barricades had been placed in front of the boardwalk. 
She said she wanted to check 
out the park but was upset when she discovered that she had to park farther away from the main entrance. 
“I hope that when they recon-
struct it, the boardwalk would be long enough to make the long walk from my car worthwhile,” Zanchetta said.  THURSDAY, MAY 22, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Starting in June, anyone 
with an Xbox will have access 
to popular online entertain-ment applications through their console without needing to purchase an Xbox Live Gold Membership.
Now, all Xbox Live users 
can access sites like Hulu Plus and Netflix without the addi-tional expense of a Gold Mem-bership, about $60 a year.
Dennis Frohlich, professor 
of UF’s video games class, said other consoles offer these appli-cations without additional fees.  Frohlich said consumers will continue to purchase the Gold Memberships because of the multiplayer feature.
“There are some Xbox 
games that can only be played with a multiplayer setting, so this feature is important to this group of consumers,” he said.
Brian Stark, a 21-year-old 
UF telecommunication senior, said once these changes come into effect, he will cancel his Gold Membership.
“The best part of the new 
consoles was that you could ac-cess the Internet on them, and it was annoying that you had to pay an extra yearly cost,” he said.Xbox Gold no longer

� EXPERTS HELD A LIVE

UF’s second annual Bug Week 
has the community buzzing about 
the jump from being completely online to having two live events this year.
These included a live Twitter chat 
on Wednesday and two weeklong scavenger hunts ending on Friday, said Jennifer Gillett-Kaufman, asso-ciate extension scientist and techni-cal adviser for Bug Week.
Wednesday’s lunchtime Twitter 
event gave participants the chance to have their bug-related questions answered by experts.One user discovered that love-
bugs, commonly found in the Southeast, are native to Mexico and Central America and aren’t actually made by UF.
“Everyone has insect questions,” 
said Rebecca Baldwin, an under-graduate coordinator in the UF de-partment of entomology and nema-tology. 
The scavenger hunts, one for fac-
ulty, staff and students, and the oth-er for families, sent participants on a campus-wide quest to take photos and answer bug-related questions.
“I think the scavenger hunt is 
really cool because it gives people who are here a chance to do some-thing, get outside and have a lot of fun,” said Carolyn Huntley, 24, a UF forest resources and conservation masters student.UF’s 2nd Annual Bug

ergy and sexual appetite — is deﬁ  nitely a thing, but it seemed this week that sudden-loud-and-
horrible-opinions-from-old-white-guys fever is a thing, too. From “Wheel of Fortune” host Pat Sajak coming out over Twitter as a global-warming truther (and inexplicably calling global warming “alarmists” unpatriotic and racist?) to a Florida representative claiming that the Common Core is part of the “gay agenda,” we’re left scratching our heads. So this one goes out to all irrelevant game show hosts and bigots with microphones: our keep-calm-but-maybe-don’t-carry-on? edition of 
Darts & Laurels
If you thought the “Common Core is a tool for the LGBT 
agenda” thing was a doozy, then you haven’t heard the recently unearthed footage of Ted Yoho suggesting only property owners should have the right to vote. Looks like the election for Florida’s third district congressional seat is between two LARPers: A sexy vampire and a Revolution-ary War reenactor. 
But is anyone surprised? It’s certainly not the most out-
landish thing Yoho has said — he once said the Affordable Care Act is racist because it includes a tax on tanning beds. Obviously it’ll never happen, but it certainly shows his attitude toward college student voters. This week, we’re tossing a lol-nice-try DART at Florida Rep. Ted Yoho. 
Good news, though, for all of you who want to escape 
the Muggle world of homophobia and regressive voting politics: This week, the Tampa Bay Times published a lengthy and enticing guide to Universal Studios’ new Di-agon Alley additions. It opens in June and will include a Hogwarts Express, the new “Escape from Gringotts” ride and expansions to the previously too-small Hogsmeade area. We’re giving Universal Studios a shut-up-and-take-
my-money LAUREL this week for giving the public what they want, nay, deserve: more Harry Potter shit to buy. 
Though the college graduation season is over, high 
school graduation season is just beginning. But let’s be real: High school graduations are way less fun than college graduations.  The commencement speeches are given by lame history teachers instead of cool celebrities, the robes are uglier and no one is drunk. None of these perfectly valid complaints mattered to Manatee High School in Bra-denton, where coveted seats at its commencement went for $200 a pop — which, by the way, is more than a ticket to the Fleetwood Mac reunion tour. Only instead of witness-ing legendary rock icons, you get to listen to a stammering valedictorian quote “Oh, the Places You’ll Go.” Manatee High, you’re getting a DART for charging exorbitant prices 
for graduation tickets when you should be paying people to even go to the ceremony in the ﬁ  rst place. 
Finally, we’re awarding a badass-of-the-week LAUREL  
to the 57-year-old Pasco woman who put up one helluva ﬁ  ght with the car thief who tried to make off with her van. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Sandra Berryman hit, kicked and bit the perp until he gave up and ﬂ  ed.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Are you prepared for 
the hurricane season? Today’s question: Do you watch Netﬂ  ix on an Xbox?Leave the guns, take the burritos
In recent years, an eruption of mass shoot-
ings at schools, malls, movie theaters and other places of business have plagued 
our great country. These senseless attacks in-stilled a certain level of fear among the Amer-ican people, who have every reason to be on heightened alert when in public places. That’s why it is so disturbing that a pro-gun group at Chipotle Mexican Grill locations in Texas decided that the best side dish for a delicious burrito is an AR-15 assault riﬂ  e. 
Why? Because America.No matter how much you support the Second Amend-
ment to the U.S. Constitution, you cannot ﬁ  nd one good reason to bring a gun of that size — or any gun for that matter — into a restaurant or similar public place. The sudden terror you bring upon restaurant patrons should weigh heavier on your conscience than your Second Amendment rights.
Sadly, that’s not the facial expression worn by two 
young men who brandished their assault weapons as they sat down for a burrito. They appear quite proud of the fact that — for no other reason than they could — they decided to bring their guns to a restaurant.
You can support the Second Amendment, own guns, 
use guns and love guns without scaring the burritos out of every customer. We’ve grown far too accustomed to hearing about mass shootings in public places, and if most people see two young males enter a restaurant armed with assault riﬂ  es, they’re going to think the worst.
Shout freedom from the rooftops all you want about 
the right to bear arms, but there’s nothing in the Constitu-tion that allows you to terrify families and children all in the name of the Second Amendment.
We also can’t forget that a private business on private 
property has the right to tell its customers to leave their guns at home.Chipotle — a private business — issued 
a statement earlier this week banning guns from all locations, unless carried by a law en-forcement ofﬁ  cer. Surely some will cry foul, claiming that Chipotle is violating their Con-stitutional rights: Hopefully they understand that Chipotle has every right to ban guns as a private business.
For responsible, law-abiding adults, you 
can purchase large guns, use them and protect 
your property and family from harm, but we do not need your guns in a popular restaurant where folks just want to enjoy their food and time with family and friends.
Gun owners want us to respect their rights, but it’s due 
time they respect the rights of every American who doesn’t want to feel threatened or uncomfortable in public.
Most gun owners in this country are responsible, law-
abiding citizens who would only use their weapons when threatened or harmed, but we must ﬁ  nd common ground and understand that there are some places where we should leave our weapons at home.
If you somehow feel that you must bring your gun — 
especially a large assault weapon — everywhere, perhaps you need to understand that more often than not, the only weapon you’ll need at a Chipotle is an antacid to calm the heartburn.
Americans have the right to bear arms, but we also 
have the right to feel safe while we consume a meal, go shopping, see a movie or do just about anything else in public. Carrying an assault riﬂ  e with you might meet one part of the Constitution, but how about having some em-pathy for those around you?
Next time you’re at Chipotle, leave the guns and take 
the burritos.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky wants to 
stir up dialogue — a word that has been forgotten in our hyper-parti-
san, deadlocked political climate.
Last week, he went on record as say-
ing that Republicans were wrong to go too crazy on voter ID restrictions and that they were offending people. In a May 11 editorial in The New York Times, Paul called for the public release of Justice De-partment memos legally justifying drone strikes, some of which were written by David J. Barron, President Obama’s new nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Paul is also a proponent of the Smarter Sentencing Act legisla-tion backed by Attorney General Eric Holder and the Obama Administration that would reduce mandatory minimum sentencing in certain nonviolent drug of-fenses and give judges more ﬂ  exibility and discretion in sentencing.
Clearly, Paul is looking past cap-turing longtime backers of his father’s grassroots presidential campaigns. He wants to run, and he wants to win. He’s framed his outreach attempts in terms of winning and losing, stating that the party needs to boldly go where no Re-publicans have gone before in order to become the dominant party again.
Paul’s high-proﬁ  le appearances in 
Memphis at a Republican National Committee event in the Sunday op-ed pages of the NYT and his speech at Howard University last April are the machinations of a politician shaping his brand — but the outreach effort itself is encouraging. While Sen. Ted Cruz con-tinues to try to milk Benghazi and Sen. Marco Rubio denies climate change, Paul is taking much-publicized steps to widen the Republican Party’s scope and appeal. There was a lot of talk about how the GOP would respond after its 2012 general election defeat — talk of an iden-tity crisis, a demographic problem and a need for more inclusiveness. That was followed by more intransigence, show-boating — hello again, Cruz — and, of course, little substance. I supported Obama in 2012. During the Republican primaries, I looked at the selection of candidates with bemused indifference at best. While it’s too early to tell (but never too early to speculate), players like former Gov. Jeb Bush and Paul make the ﬁ  eld easier to take seriously this time.
It says something about the sorry 
state American politics is in when a pub-lic ofﬁ  cial sounding open-minded and not-so-entrenched within their party line makes headlines — in the context of gearing up for a presidential run, no less. At the same time, Paul’s willing-ness to communicate across the aisle and beyond dogma is duly noted — as he’d hoped.

Unsafe conditions endanger children
Dear editor,Florida executed Elmer Carroll on May 29, 2013, for the 1990 
rape and stabbing of 10-year-old Christine McGowan. Carroll lived in a homeless mens’ mission next door to McGowan.
The 2013 execution news of Carroll forced me to rethink my 
57 months of “house-parenting” Key West history that ended in May 2013.
Key West has two licensed by the Department of Children 
and Families:  Seven-bed shelters for foster kids who are sand-wiched within a couple of car links to institutional facilities that house 32 indigent mental clients and a homeless shelter for men transitioning out of jail. 
The Monroe County Jail website reports recurring arrests 
coming from these two adult facility addresses.
I spent last summer writing Gov. Rick Scott to address this 
risky place for Florida’s most vulnerable kids. Ironically, Scott had signed Carroll’s execution document. No response from Scott.
In the last few weeks, I’ve met two social workers with pro-
fessional doctorate degrees who express “unbelievable” when I described this ongoing “unsafe” for kids in the Key West situ-ation.
Doesn’t Rick Scott learn from his history?

THE 3-YEAR-OLD  FESTIVAL RUNS FOR TWO DAYS.
CODY SMITH
Avenue Writer
Central Florida’s music scene continues 
to grow as yet another festival graces Tampa. 
Sunset Music Festival, the aptly titled event scheduled to take place May 24 and 25, will bring some of the biggest names in electronic dance music to the North Lot of the Raymond James Stadium.
This will be the third year the festival has 
taken place on the North Lot, but its first year as a two-day event. 
Disco Donnie communications director 
Evan Bailey said the Memorial Day weekend helped inspire the expansion.
 “Based upon the explosive growth of last 
year’s event and the nature of Memorial Day weekend as a destination holiday, we felt it was time to expand to a two-day event so we could feature an even larger event lineup with new artists and sounds,” Bailey said.
Sunset is expected to draw 40,000 to 50,000 
attendees during the weekend. This year’s it-eration of the festival will include more shad-ed areas, art displays, free water stations and stage production. Bailey also teased at a few secret surprises yet to be revealed.
The festival comes at a time when electronic 
dance music seems to only grow larger by the day. While festivals such as Ultra Music Fes-tival and Electric Daisy Carnival offer grand displays of talent and production, Sunset Music Festival provides a cheaper yet just-as memorable alternative. 
The growth of electronic dance music could 
largely be attributed to the college crowd. Mi-chael Vensamoye, a 20-year-old UF telecom-munication senior, is excited for the eclectic lineup. “I get to see every electronic genre from 
trace to deep house to hardstyle all in one place,” he said.
The festival enlisted the likes of Hardwell, 
Zedd, Krewella and Benny Benassi to headline the event. Up-and-coming producers such as the Chainsmokers, Cash Cash and Tchami round out the undercard.
Festival organizers emphasized the in-
creased role of rising genres and artists this year.
“Simply put, the fans’ tastes inspire us,” 
Bailey said. “Their support of new artists and genres is fantastic and allows us to try new things and book new artists and sounds.”
As electronic dance music and festivals 
grow, festival organizers hope to turn Sunset Music Festival into one of the nation’s pre-miere music festivals.
“Over the past couple years, the festival’s growth has been dramatic, and we’re thank-ful for the fans continued support in helping build its profile so quickly,” Bailey said.
Tickets can still be purchased on smftampa.
com. General admission tickets are $159 and VIP tickets are $229. The festival will run from 2 p.m. to midnight on Saturday and Sunday. Set times, the festival map and FAQ are all currently available on smftampa.com.

Slow Gainesville summers are ide-
al for sampling the best-loved local 
restaurants. But before you set out to swipe some plastic at Satchel’s or Vine, make sure the restaurant accepts elec-tronic tender. 
Several Gainesville-area restaurants 
only accept cash for payment.
Stephanie White, marketing and 
promotion manager at City Bar & Lounge, 115 NW Second Ave. in Tren-ton said the charges for electronic ten-der were too much. Instead of continu-ing to pay the service charges, she invested in her own personal ATM to help custom-ers.
“The very few people who come in 
and do not have cash, I just point them over to the ATM,” she said.
For Teresa Zokovitch, owner of 
Vine, 627 N. Main St.,  being a cash-only venue has as much to do with helping her community as it does with For local eats, bring cash

If traveling to Tampa is not in your itiner-
ary for the Memorial Day weekend, you’re in 
luck: You can still bust out your flower crown for the Follow the Sun music festival, coming to Gainesville on May 24.
The itinerant festival is quite literally travel-
ing from Florida’s east coast to its west coast this weekend. More than 40 bands will be playing on its three stages. Some will play on Friday in St. Augustine, some in Gainesville on Saturday and some in Cedar Key on Sunday.
Festival founders Mike Collins and Jon 
Reinertsen created Follow the Sun to high-light the state’s musicians. Additionally,  these members of Gainesville band Whiskey & Co. also wanted to honor their home state with a festival format that puts the Florida landscape front and center.
Tickets start at $15 for Friday, $20 for Sat-
urday or $30 for all three days. Sunday shows in Cedar Key are included in any ticket pur-chase.

and The Atlantic will each host some of the Gainesville shows. Florida-focused music fest to

From Tinder to Thrill to Grou-
per and Grindr, dating apps are 
some of the most popular social developments to hit mobile devic-es in recent memory.
The ease and speed by which 
people can anonymously judge and ogle the value of their peers as a potential partner or hookup has rarely been easier. Especially when a user can simply read a sentence or two of description, swipe through a couple pictures and decide inter-est in the span of seconds.
However, the same ease and 
anonymity that has attracted so many users to dating apps has also attracted the attention of indi-viduals who take advantage of the app’s anonymity and superﬁ  cial identiﬁ  cation to prey on the large user base.
Grindr-related crimes have been 
springing up throughout the coun-try, according to a recent story by Vocativ. A victim comes in contact with a stranger through the mobile app and arranges a meetup only to be mugged, attacked or sexually assaulted.
Reports of men in Philadel-
phia, Seattle and Delaware being mugged, sexually assaulted or beat-en by strangers they’d met through Grindr have led websites like the Gaily Grind and Queerty to pub-lish tip sheets on mobile dat-ing and has even spurred Grindr to release its own set 
of safety policies on its website.
However, the surge of crime 
and news on Grindr  may be no different from what you’d ﬁ  nd on other dating apps.
While fear of strangers should 
never deter you from meeting people, there are precautions you should take before meeting with someone you’ve met through a dating app.Verify:
Whenever you get a message 
from someone on a dating app, it’s highly suggested you verify their ex-istence on other social media and try to look up more about them as an actual individual and not just someone’s dummy account.
Association:
Don’t rush things or be rushed 
by someone met through a dating 
app and only share a location when you’re comfortable with the other person.
Inform friends:
It’s always a good idea to keep 
friends informed about people you’ve been talking to through a 
mobile app. Tell them where you’ll be if you do decide to meet a digital acquaintance. 
Report harassment:
If an individual is making you 
feel distinctly uncomfortable or oth-
erwise harassing you for personal information online, there’s a chance they’ll do so to others and should be blocked or reported to authorities.
Avoid excessive sharing early on:
This should go without saying, 
but be very careful about the infor-
mation you share online that might be used to track you or otherwise indicate a location for stalkers.

Cash-only vendors may 
spot you if you forget
keeping costs down.
Zokovitch said she does not see 
the necessity in paying huge cor-
porations a fee of 3 percent for her customers using their credit cards at her establishment.
“My business is not about mak-
ing money; it’s about having peo-ple coming in and trying my prod-uct,” she said.
Zokovitch purchased an ATM 
to accommodate customers who can’t pay because they didn’t bring cash. If there is still an issue with paying, she will spot the customer and tape his or her receipt on a wall and expect to be paid back the following day, she said.
“Luckily we do not have any 
receipts on the wall currently,” she said.
Hogan’s Great Sandwiches 
has been accepting only cash for 30 years now, and if a customer, speciﬁ  cally a student, does not have enough money to pay, then the sandwich shop will spot them for the rest of their bill, said Kelly Dratezato, an employee of Hogan’s Great Sandwiches.
“Ninety-eight percent of cus-
tomers who received help actually paid us back,” she said.
Mari Reyes, a 21-year-old polit-
ical science senior said she under-stands why some restaurants don’t accept plastic. 
“Logistically I think establish-
ments that are cash-only are incon-venient for students, but realisti-cally the cheaper the better,” Reyes said. CASH , from page 8KELSI and KERI MATWICK

Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at who 
will bring you the column Matwick Mus-
ings and Munchings this Summer. 
We are in the graduate program in lin-
guistics at UF and are in our ﬁ  fth year of studying language and teaching writing, and yes, we are twin sisters.
Matwick Musings and Munchings is a 
column that will engage readers from two prongs of inquiry: food and language. We hope to bring a greater awareness to each and how they are related. 
Topics will range from musings (like 
how to make the perfect toast), observa-tions (such as the latest food trends—Srira-cha! Gelato!) to more academically minded issues such as food and identity; food his-tory; food and ethnicity; food and gender; and food media. We’ll bring in abstract 
ideas from scholars such as Pierre Bourdieu and Claude Lévi-Strauss and from food writers such as Jean Anthelme Brillat-Sa-varin (“Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what 
you are”), M.F.K Fisher and Michael Pollan, but we promise to break down the concepts into more accessible terms and connect the-ory with concrete examples.
We hope to spark inspired interactions 
with food and language by ending each column with a question, or ‘The Nibble,’ to keep you  exploring and thinking about the language of food in your daily life. 
So, ‘The Nibble’ for this week:Take a look 
at the descriptions on your favorite bag of chips. What values are promoted? Do they match yours?Meet the Matwicks: Musings

So before you ditch your preprofessional major for something you’re “passionate about,” check your privilege and consider what it means to be able to “do what you love.” Spread the word.

Teeing Off
Florida football early enrollee Duke Dawson won WCJB-TV20’s Male 
Scholar Athlete of the Year Award. The freshman has a chance to start at defensive back for UF this season.Coach Will Muschamp and the Gators have 100 days until the new season begins. Read the story on page 19. JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
During a midgame inter-
view with ESPN, coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan credited UF’s success late in the regular season to its ability to hit in the clutch.
However, top-seeded Florida 
failed to come through at the plate in its 4-2 loss to No. 9-seed Kentucky on Wednesday in the second round of the Southeastern Conference Tournament.
Freshman Logan Shore suf-
fered his third loss of the season after giving up four earned runs on six hits in 5.2 innings of work. The Coon Rapids, Minn., native threw 102 pitches in the contest — two shy of his season high set on March 14 against Arkansas — while fanning five batters in the process. Shore threw 35 pitches in the first inning alone with three Kentucky batters having at-bats of at least six pitches in the frame.
“I thought he made some 
good pitches,” O’Sullivan said of Shore’s first inning. “I just credit Kentucky’s hitters. They did a nice job of extending some at-bats on some really quality pitches.”
The Gators (37-20) logged 
just six hits and struck out seven times against the Wildcats (34-22) at Hoover Metropolitan Sta-dium and did not have back-to-back hits in the contest. Kentucky pitcher Kyle Cody retired 10 con-secutive Gators before walking shortstop Richie Martin in the bottom of the sixth.
Kentucky jumped to a quick 
2-0 lead in the first inning on an RBI double by left fielder Ka’ai Tom and a sacrifice fly by first baseman Thomas Bernal.
Florida cut that lead in half in 
the second frame after right field-er Braden Mattson, who led off the inning with his fifth double of the year and was the only UF player to have multiple hits, ad-vanced to third on a Zack Pow-ers groundout and then made it home on a Peter Alonso ground-out to shortstop.
The Wildcats then added two 
insurance runs in the third inning when third baseman Max Kuhn hit a home run over the left-field fence — the first home run Shore surrendered all season.
Florida’s biggest opportunity 
to close the gap against Kentucky came in the sixth inning. 
The Gators loaded the bases 
with one out on a Martin walk, a Harrison Bader single and a Taylor Gushue walk. Mattson hit a sac fly to right-center field to score Martin, but Powers then lined out to end the inning and strand the other two baserun-
ners.
UF finished the game with five 
runners left on base. 
Florida now enters the loser’s 
bracket and risks being elimi-
nated from the SEC Tournament without a win for the second straight year.

The ranking in the final and most 
important golf tournament of the 
year is crucial. But for the Gators, their ranking hasn’t changed yet.
No. 16 Florida improved its team 
score but stayed stagnant in its tie for 16th place at the four-day NCAA Women’s Golf Championship in Tul-sa, Okla. 
The Gators shot 292 (+12), 13 
strokes better than their round one score. They have now shot 597 (+37) through two rounds at the par-70 Tulsa Country Club.
No. 10 Oklahoma 
also retained its first-place ranking with a cumulative score of 575 (+15) and is three strokes ahead of second-place Duke. Sooner Alex-
andra Kaui leads in the individual race with a five-under-par 135 score.

6-1-1, 6-0-2, 6-2-0. They’re not area codes 
found in your local phone book, they’re dif-
ferent number combinations to get to the magic number the Southeastern Conference has finally settled on as it pertains to league football games: eight. 
The combination of games that the con-
ference will use moving forward is 6-1-1. Six games against a team’s divisional op-ponent, one permanent game against a pre-determined cross-division opponent and one rotating game against an opposite di-vision opponent that will rotate every year alternating home and away.On Tuesday, the conference announced 
the rotating opponents for all teams through 2025. For Florida, the lineup is: 2014 at Ala-bama; 2015 vs. Ole Miss; 2016 at Arkansas; 2017 vs. Texas A&M; 2018 at Mississippi State; 2019 vs. Auburn; 2020 at Ole Miss; 2021 vs. Alabama; 2022 at Texas A&M; 2023 vs. Arkansas; 2024 at Auburn; 2025 vs. Mis-sissippi State.
But there’s a team lost in that shuffle: 
Auburn. Florida will play Auburn just twice in the next 10 years, and the Gators will have to wait until 2024 to play at the famed Jordan-Hare Stadium.

“I was sitting with coach 
(Steve) Spurrier, and he looked at me and said, ‘You know Flor-ida and Auburn won’t play for every six years?’ He said ‘that’s not good for the SEC,’” coach Will Muschamp said to the me-dia before a speaking engage-ment Tuesday.
The 6-1-1 appeases the an-
cient cross-division rivalries in the conference, mainly: Tennes-see vs. Alabama and Georgia vs. Auburn. One team that isn’t happy about it is LSU, which Florida will keep as its perma-nent opponent. 
LSU is vocally opposed to 
being attached at the hip with UF. 
Muschamp said that’s just 
part of the deal and not every-body can be happy.
“There’s some give and take 
in everybody,” he said.  “Noth-ing’s perfect, I can tell you that. Nothing’s going to satisfy ev-erybody in the room as far as each school and institutions. 
“As far as what’s fair and 
what’s not fair, at the end of the day, it was going to be 6-1-1. So you can stand around on the ta-ble and run around if you want to, at the end of the day it was going to be 6-1-1.” JONATHAN CZUPRYN

Damontre Harris, who 
didn’t play a single minute for 
the Gators during his two-year tenure in Gainesville, will not return to Florida for the 2014-2015 season.
Jon Rothstein of CBSSports.
com initially reported on his Twitter account (@JonRoth-stein) that the 6-foot-10 power forward and coach Billy Dono-van officially split ties Wednes-day, which UF then confirmed.
After joining Donovan 
and the Gators following his sophomore campaign at South Carolina, Harris was forced to redshirt the 2012-2013 season to comply with the NCAA’s transfer rules. However, when the big man out of Fayetteville, N.C., was eligible to compete last year, shoulder injuries and off-the-court issues kept him from ever playing for Florida.
On Oct. 31, Donovan sus-
pended Harris for violating team rules. On Dec. 21, Dono-van dismissed Harris from the squad after the former All-Southeastern Conference De-fensive Team member failed to accomplish the necessary steps to make a comeback.
Although Donovan reinstat-
ed Harris little more than two weeks after releasing him, the veteran coach said he would need to see a changed attitude in Harris for him to return to the Gators for the 2014-2015 season.
“It could be a great, great 
story in his life if we can find a way to try to help him,” Dono-van said on Jan. 8. “Whenever he gets to practice, if he’s ever able to play here, he knows exactly what he needs to do. Whether or not he can do it, we’ll see, but he wants to give it a shot. And I figured I’d like to try and help him see what he can do.”
After Harris’ departure and 
after former USF center John Egbunu transferred to Florida on May 15, the Gators are back to having 13 scholarship play-ers on the roster, which is the maximum amount allowed by the NCAA.

One year ago, Florida was coming off a 
magical 11-2 season that included a berth 
in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. The Gators were pegged to contend for a Southeastern Confer-ence Eastern Division title and were even la-beled as a dark-horse national title candidate in 2013.This summer, the Gators are rebounding 
from a 4-8, injury-plagued season that brought the program from powerhouse to laughing-stock in just one season’s time.
“I don’t blame anybody for being upset,” 
coach Will Muschamp said to the crowd at the Titletown Gator Club on Tuesday evening. “4-8 (is) unacceptable and we’ve got to get it fixed and that’s what we’re going to do.” After Florida’s worst season since going 
0-10-1 in 1979, there is only one thing to do as a coaching staff moving forward: stay positive and remain confident in the process.
But keeping that confidence in your system 
as head coach doesn’t preclude you from mak-ing changes. In January, Florida hired former Duke coach Kurt Roper as its new offensive coordinator and took on Mike Summers from USC to become the new offensive line coach.
The decision to make the new hires came 
after Florida finished with the worst total of-fense in the SEC, producing just 4.8 yards per play and 18.8 points per game — both those statistics put the Gators in the bottom 100 teams in the entire Football Bowl Subdivi-sion.
When you hit rock bottom — and an argu-
ment could easily be made that 2013 was Flor-ida’s rock bottom — the only way to go is up.
That process starts by improving the of-
fense.
Roper’s track record at Duke is a positive 
one. Last season, his offense finished ranked in the top five in almost every offensive category in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Blue Devils had one of the most explosive offenses in the conference, which included Clemson and national champion Florida State.
Perhaps more encouraging for Florida fans is the 178 rushing yards per game Duke racked up last year under Roper. The Gators enter this season with one of the deepest run-ning back corps in the conference, led by red-shirt senior Mack Brown, junior Matt Jones and sophomore Kelvin Taylor. Early enrollee Brandon Powell could get some reps if needed as well.
Quarterback Jeff Driskel looked more com-
fortable in the system during the spring and can create plays with his feet more easily in Roper’s shotgun formations than he could un-der center.
Quarterbacks Anthony Boone and Bran-
don Cornette, who split reps last season, combined for more than 500 yards rushing in Roper’s system in 2013 at Duke.
Perhaps the most challenging obstacle the 
Gators will face this season is one that they have no control over: Their schedule.
The 2014 season is highlighted by road 
trips to Alabama, Tennessee, Vanderbilt and FSU. Following the trip to Knoxville, Tenn., Florida is tasked with the challenge of hav-ing LSU and Missouri back-to-back at home. The Gators  then get a bye before the annual Florida-Georgia game in Jacksonville — a con-test that Muschamp has yet to win as either a player or coach.  
One year ago, it seemed Florida football 
was back on top. Now, Muschamp’s job se-curity is in question depending on how 2014 goes.
With the season kicking off Aug. 30 against 
Idaho, Florida’s magic number is down to 100. Muschamp, the Gators and the fans have just 100 days left until they see if the changes made this offseason will be enough.
