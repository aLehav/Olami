'CSI' star describes four-step success program
"". a. . nht"CSI: NY" actor Hill Harper speaks to an audience in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom on Monday night.By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Hill Harper hates the word
"try."
"Most people who use that little
three-letter word, that's all they
end up doing," he said.
More than 800 people packed
the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom
Monday night to hear the "CSI:
NY" star and author speak about
how he works to achieve his life
goals.
The Accent show was also
sponsored by Black History Month
and the Black Graduate Student
Organization, said Accent chair-
man Jason Attermann.
Harper was paid $30,000, ac-
cording to Student Government
Finance records.
Harper expressed his concerns
about people's tendencies to let
things come to them and hope
they fall into place, something he
referred to as a "lotto mentality."
He suggested a four-step pro-
cess to achieve goals, comparing
the process to that of an architect
preparing to build a structure.
The steps include sketching a
blueprint, laying a foundation,building a framework and mak-
ing sure there are entry and exit
points.
For Harper, one of the most im-
portant aspects of a foundation is
education.
He told the audience about his
encounter with Barack Obama
while studying at Harvard Law
School.
"Most people who use
that little three-letter word,
that's all they end up do-
ing."

CSI NY star
While shooting hoops alone at
the school's gym, Obama came
in to play some ball with him.
They became friends, and Harper
said he was astounded with how
Obama had gone back to school
after working for six years.
He said Obama had realized
he needed to reinforce his founda-
tion.
"I looked up to him, and not
just because he was taller," Harper
said.

Gainesville residents can get more than
a book at a local library Monday evenings.
Operating out of a bus parked at the
Tower Road Branch Library, 3020 SW 75th
St., more than 15 volunteer students and
physicians treated patients without health
insurance at the Mobile Clinic.
The clinic can serve up to six patients
a night but has only served three or four
patients a night.Patients first meet with undergraduate
students, who help them create a Google
Health profile.
The profile gives patients a virtual way
to carry their health records to any doc-
tor's office or hospital.
Medical students then treat the pa-
tients, under the supervisionLocal of a volunteer physician, inNews an exam room on the bus.
Ada Roberts, 51, works as
a janitor, cleaning the library after it closes.
She is uninsured and was visiting the clinic
for the second time on Monday night.
The free clinic will continue every Mon-
day night.

Panel discusses ways to help children in poverty
By ERICA COOK
Alligator Contributing Writer
A group of four panelists de-
scribed the working conditions of
children in underdeveloped coun-
tries and highlighted efforts to help
impoverished children during a
discussion at the Pugh Hall Ocora
Monday night.
A crowd of about 60 gathered
to listen to the talk, sponsored by
Gators for Asha, which educates un-
derprivileged children in India, and
the UF chapter of Children Beyond
Our Borders, which helps more than
100 children in Colombia.
The discussion kicked off Educa-
tion Awareness Week, which pro-
motes the importance of helping im-
poverished children in developing
coutries.
Taryn Devereux, the public rela-
tions director for UF's Children Be-
yond Our Borders, moderated the
discussion.
Devereux asked the panelists,
which included two UF professors,
a UF alumna and a UT student,
about the best ways to help children
in poverty create a better life.Angelica Suarez, a UF alumna
and panelist, emphasized the im-
portance of listening to impover-
ished children."If we don't listen to them, we
will fail every time we try to imple-
ment a new project," Suarez said.
"Listening to children is the bestway to get through to them."
Suarez said children who grow
up in poverty are not exposed to a
wide variety of career goals and may

"I want to be a mother, house-
keeper or taxi driver," she said.
"These are the type of answers we
would get when we ask the children
what they want to be when they
grow up.
Her solution is to give the chil-
dren a glimpse of what is outside
their environment.
"We try to give them exposure to
other things they can achieve," she
said.
The other panelists included Re-
nata Serra, a lecturer in UF's College
of Liberal Arts and Sciences and a
development economist; Tim Foga-
rty, a UF professor and the program
coordinator for the UF in Nicara-
gua study abroad program; and Ali
Zuaiter, a UF business major.
Shivashankar Halan, a member
of Gators for Asha, was pleased
with the outcome of the discussion
panel.
"It was really informative,"
Halan said. "Although our goals are
the same, it was interesting to see
how other like-minded organiza-
tions work on implementing these
types of projects."
Teams to debate racism
* THE WINNING TEAM WILL RECEIVE
A $200 PRIZE.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Students will debate how to end racial
disparity in education during the first Great
Gator Debaters Tournament today at 7 p.m.
in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
The tournament was created by Student
Body Vice President Larnell Vickers, who
was inspired by the movie "The Great De-
baters," starring Denzel Washington.
"I honestly think it will be a ground-
breaking event, and it will continue on,"
Vickers said.
He said he wanted to bring a new ele-
ment to Black History Month activities by
having an event that focused on education
as well as entertainment.
The debate will feature two two-person
teams representing two UF organizations:the Military Law Student Association and
Esquire, a society of minority pre-law stu-
dents.
Tournament director Cecil Duffie said
students will discuss different ways of stop-
ping inequality in education.
"I honestly think it will be a ground-
breaking event, and it will continue
on."

Mayor candidate plans to tackle crime, meal limit
Editor's Note: This is the second segment of the
Faces in the Race series.
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Staff Writer
Ozzy Angulo has been a bus boy, a bartender and a
manager at Taco Bell.
This March, he's hoping to add another job to that list.
Angulo, 29, is running for Gainesville mayor, and as
the election nears, he is looking beyond his opponents.
"I'm not in it to beat someone else," he said. "I'm in
it to raise awareness in the community, and nothing can
be fixed unless the community and government work to-
gether."
If elected, Angulo said he plans to tackle the climbing
crime rate and public transportation policy, specifically for
Santa Fe College students.
But for the New York native who accompanied his girl-
friend to Gainesville in July 2008, there is another issue at
the foundation of his political platform.
Currently, the city limits the number of meals the home-
less can receive from churches and the St. Francis House
soup kitchen.
"It appears the city is trying to alleviate the pressures
of the homeless population by limiting their ability to eat,"
Angulo said. "But all it's really doing is limiting their abil-
ity to live."
He volunteered at St. Francis House Saturday, encour-aging residents of the shelter to register to vote.
James Bryant, 58, a St. Francis House resident, worked
alongside Angulo, promising the candidate a vote in the
upcoming election.
"It's good to see someone come in," he said. "It's good
to see people get involved. Anytime a man steps up like
that -I like that. Here, we wash each other's hands."
At St. Francis House, residents like Bryant are looking
for someone to be their voice.
Lugging a water cooler out into the cafeteria for the
dining homeless and hungry, the candidate related the is-
sue to his former career in the U.S. Marine Corps.
"When you get put in a position where
Faces you lose your resources, you go into sur-
in the vivor mode," he said. ". I've been in sur-
Race vival training."
But in terms of the brewing mayoral
race, he is hardly surviving.
Angulo knows this, just like he knows the likelihood of
victory isn't likely.
According to the latest campaign finance report, An-
gulo has raised no money.
"I think of defeat every single day," he said. "I feel like
Rocky Balboa in 'Rocky' I."
And although Angulo has accepted his position in the
race, he has not accepted the current state of local politics,
especially in regard to the homelessness regulations.
"I know I am the obvious underdog," he said. "But I'm
not trying to divide people further. I'm trying to unite a
community."Maria Farias

UF will no longer sanction, sponsor student trips to Haiti
0 NEW POLICY BASED ON SAFETY
WARNINGS FROM GOVERNMENT.
ByCJ PRUNER
and ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writers
UF announced in a memo last week that
it will no longer sponsor or sanction stu-
dent trips to Haiti.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said the
new policy is based on health and safety
warnings from the federal and state gov-
ernments and from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.She said riots and disease will make the
country unsafe.
"It's going to be progressively more
dangerous in Haiti," Sikes said.
Students and faculty can still travel to
Haiti, but they must take time off from
classes and research and pay their own
way, Sikes said.
Under the new policy, organizations
such as Project Haiti, a group that has been
going to Haiti and the Dominican Republic
during spring break since 1996 to provide
free medical care, would not be allowed to
travel.
Daniel Lombardo, a second-year UF
medical student and one of the group's tripleaders, said the organization could lose
about $6,000 in Student Government fund-
ing should it choose to go to Haiti because
SG funding would constitute university
sponsorship.
"At this point, we real-
ly can't interpret anything
yet," Lombardo said.
The group still plans
to go to the Dominican
Republic during spring
Sikes break and is trying to find
a way to travel to Haiti.
The announcement also affects the plans
of Jon Bougher and Roman Safiullin, two
UF graduate students who were filming adocumentary in Haiti when the earthquake
struck.
Bougher said he is unsure if they will
be permitted to return to Haiti because the
film is part of their master's thesis work at
UF.
In order to make the return trip, they
would need a travel authorization from the
university, Bougher said.
But Bougher said the film is between
50 percent to 60 percent complete, and he
wants to go to Haiti.
"I understand the liability issues with
students going [to Haiti], but we need to go
down and get the rest of the story," Bough-
er said.

Sheriff's office posts mugshot links on Facebook page
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Facebook wall on the Ala-
chua County Sheriff's Office fan
page is no longer just a place for
announcements and Christmas
party pictures.
The ASO public information
office began posting links to pic-
tures of people with felony and
misdemeanor warrants in Ala-
chua County on its profile page
Friday.The links, which will be updat-
ed weekly, are expected to enable
Facebook users to provide tips
and help officers locate criminals,
according to ASO spokesman Art
Forgey.
"We're new to the social me-
dia thing," he said.
The sheriff's office first creat-
ed a Facebook profile, a YouTube
channel and Twitter account in
June and July of 2009.
However, until now the ac-
counts have all been mostly usedto post official
notices and eve
videos.
"We're new t
media
The sheriff's
page had 440 fan
Monday.
The use of mupdates, event networking tools by law enforce-
nt pictures and ment agencies is a growing trend,
Forgey said, because nearly ev-
: the social eryone is online.
"There are so many people on
thing." social media sites all the time," he
Art Forgey said. "We're missing a resource if
ASO spokesman we don't use it. You take the info
to where the people are."
office Facebook Forgey also pointed to the new
s as of 7:30 p.m. additions to the Facebook page
as another trend in the growing
edia and social virtual cooperation and commu-
nication between local citizensand police as an innovative way
to tackle crime.
Because keeping up a Face-
book page takes little time and
is free to use, it would be worth
having even if it yielded only one
tip, he added.
Those who wish to browse
criminal listings or submit a tip
to the Alachua County Sheriff's
Office can find the profile by typ-
ing "Alachua County Sheriff" in

Flower fashion raises funds
0 THE MONEY WENT TO A LOCAL
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
Ladies, lunch and fashion raised about $1,000
for a local elementary school Monday at the
Gainesville Garden Club and Garden Center.
The fashion show, titled Soup, Salad, Sweets
& Swish, cost $15 and featured models with
flower-printed blouses, slimming pants and
pastel-colored tote bags.
"I've never modeled before," said Mary Lou
Merkner, a 16-year garden club member. "But
this was a great opportunity to have fun and
raise money for our school projects."Every year, the Gainesville Garden Club
partners with Lake Forest Elementary School to
work with students on gardening projects.
Cile Pfahler, a 30-year member of the garden
club, said the money raised will fund projects
for Mother's Day, Veterans Day and the winter
holidays.
"We normally go out and buy supplies such
as flower seeds, soil and pots for students to cre-
ate their own flower projects," Pfahler said. "We
teach students to properly grow and maintain
flowers."

Former Alaska governor
may run for presidentY ou betcha'
Everyone's favorite Wasilla, Alaska, might-as-
well-be-an-eskimo native, binoculars-not-needed-to-
see-Russia, book-writin' maverick might run for the highest
office in the land in 2012.
Oh, wait, we were supposed to be surprised by that?
She didn't just leave her fellow Alaskans high and dry af-
ter resigning as governor of the largest state in the country to
take a little vacation?
No. Apparently Sarah Palin, the gem of Fox News and the
apple to the Republican Party's eye, will run for president in
two years -that is if it's good for the good ole USA and her
family.
You know, the knocked-up daughter and the ex-future
son-in-law who posed for Playgirl.
America, can't we learn from our mistakes the first time?
We're not going to verbally bash anyone (in print), but do
we really want a president on whom the Republican Party
once spent $150,000 for clothes and makeup?
Complaining about Obama's new $1.3 trillion deficit now?
Imagine when Sephora has sales!
On the bright side, think about how nice it would look to
replace that scrawny, boring Lincoln guy from the $5 bill for
the newer, trendier, lipstick-loving hockey mom.
That's the kind of monetary policy the Editorial Board
likes to see.
But, of course, none of this is definite yet, and Palin still
has some time to gauge her country's and family's readiness
for the potential move to a certain white house that is not an
igloo.
Palm Reader
nd just when youthought our ranting
about Sarah Palin
was over, the Editorial Board
is here to issue you another
full serving.
It appears that every-
one's favorite former vice
presidential candidate wrote
some notes on the palm of
her hand when she appeared
at the first National Tea Par-
ty Convention in Nashville,
Tenn., on Saturday.
The Associated Press hasher speech, Palin was critical
of President Obama, calling
him a charismatic guy with a
teleprompter.
This sounds to us like a
case of the pot calling the
kettle black.
We certainly don't care
if Palin reads notes off her
hands, if Obama reads a
speech off a teleprompter or
if former President Bush de-
cides to have someone hold
up cue cards with pictures to
prompt him on what to talk
a photo of Palin behind the about next, just don't be crit-
lectern with her hands raised ical of something and then
and words visible.
Other photos show the
words "energy," "tax" and
"lift American spirits" on
her palm.
Now, this doesn't seem
like that big of a deal at
first -just about everyone
makes notes before speaking
at large events -but duringdo the exact same thing.
Palin needs to get off her
high critical horse and real-
ize that in the world of poli-
tics it's OK to use notes.
However, it's not OK to
spout out backhanded com-
pliments about the president
and then turn around and do
the same thing.

Singles should seize V-Day opportunity
think Valentine's Day is really a holiday for singles.I'll freely admit to my biases. Unless something really
unexpectedly awesome happens in the next five days or
so, I'm staring down the barrel of my 21st consecutive Val-
entine's Day on which I'm not actually in a relationship -a
feat that happens so consistently and expertly every damn
February that, at this point, I think it's kind of a talent. So my
feeling toward Feb. 14 could very easily be bitterness.
But Valentine's Day, as it's generally celebrated now, has
always struck me as a holiday that exists primarily to make
people in relationships feel bad -and, at the same time, to
enrich companies that sell shiny or pretty things that'll make
people in relationships feel better.
I don't pretend that that's a novel idea -people complain
about the commercialization of our culture, and rightfully so.
But I do think it's an idea that's worth repeating, because the
commercialization of love is particularly abhorrent.
One of the main ideas behind love, after all, is finding
someone you love uniquely, someone whose quirks you find
endearing, someone whose flaws you find charming (or at
least forgivable), someone whose smile coaxes out your own
and someone who feels the same about you. Expressing that
love should be a very personal and individual experience
and not dictated by Kay Jewelers marketing department.
If we cut through all the bullshit associated with the holi-
day -the manipulative TV commercials, the "spending
equals love" mentality, the purported rules and procedures
for dating -Valentine's Day is really just an excuse to tell
someone you like just how much you like them.
And this is why I think Valentine's Day should really be
about those who aren't already in a relationship. People al-
ready in relationships usually have ample excuses every day
to do that; people who are single don't.
So here's my suggestion for those who are single: If you
have somebody in mind that you legitimately like and care
about, tell them. And if you think you might want to get din-
ner or a movie or whatever with them, tell them that too.'U
Joe Dellosa
Ietters@alligator orgI know this all sounds very seventh
grade, and we should all probably
be past the whole "unspoken crush"
thing. But not all of us are, and a lot of
otherwise socially adept people who
graduated from middle school know
someone who inexplicably draws out
that awkward, oh-God-why-am-I-so-
bad-at-this side of them.
If you're one of these people, I'm
calling you out. Because there's rarely a legitimate reason not
to tell them how you feel.
"What if they don't take it well?" As long as you're not
weird or creepy about it, most kindhearted people will take
it as a compliment.
"What if it ruins our friendship?" If it does, it probably
wasn't the most solid friendship anyway. And in general,
anybody who values his or her friendships doesn't end them
for minor stuff.
"What if it winds up being something I regret doing?"
Almost universally, the regret people feel over the chances
they didn't take sting much more in retrospect than the ones
they did.
"What if they say 'no'?" It could happen, but at the very
least, I'm sure they'll appreciate knowing how well they're
regarded.
I understand that trying to find someone to love is an
exercise in silly optimism, but there are worse things in the
world than being a silly optimist. Using Valentine's Day to
tell someone how you feel about them isn't just the purest
use of the day, it's a stab at taking the holiday back from
those who try to define love in their own financial terms and
monetize our emotions. Our love and our emotions belong
to us, after all. And so does Valentine's Day. So, get goin' and
tell someone you care about they look cute today.

-Letter to the Editor
Alligator op-ed section is too
liberal, indecent
I was at Shands yesterday and
read the latest edition of the liberal
rag you call the Alligator. If nothing
else, it is good for a laugh.
Your op-ed about equality really
made me chuckle. Do you honestly
believe that your political comments
are equal between the left and the
right? All you do is knock the right
and glorify the lefties, including your
leader Pinocchio.
And you certainly qualify as a lib-
eral rag when you champion same-sex
marriages and gays in the military.
Have you or any of your mature
and seasoned staff, who probablyhave never done anything but go to
school, ever spent time in the mili-
tary? I doubt it, so you really have no
idea how the military feels about this
issue.
If you did, you would find about
99.9 percent don't want homos or les-
bians. I just read that Gainesville was
voted the No. 11 gayest city in the
country. Wow -what an honor. Are
you and your staff all gay?
Two final comments: 1) Your Tom-
my Maple is a wacko. 2) Your article
on BJ's was terrible. Just shows how
stupid you folks really are. They sure
don't teach decency at UF.
Please read the rest of this letter at al-
ligator.org.

Gator Growl wants Student Body's opinion for 2010 show
Some people may think it is awfully earlyin the year to begin talking about the
next Gator Growl, but people have been
planning the 2010 Growl since late December.
Figuring out comedians, performers or
musical acts takes months of preparations, ne-
gotiations and gathering input.
Putting together the perfect lineup for
Growl's show is no easy task. I have heard this
from Growl production staffs in the past, and
I know from experience having worked as di-
rector of public relations on last year's show.
Last year, however, we implemented a rev-
olutionary system for deciding on Growl per-
formers. We created a student suggestion e-mail address, and then we compiled a student
survey to include the entirety of the Gator
population in the talent selecting process.
The 2009 show received great reviews
from all sides of the audience because every-
one's opinion was represented by the talent
that was chosen.
After all, Gator Growl is entirely about
The Gator Nation. Adding this aspect of open
communication between the Growl staff, stu-
dents and alumni makes the show even more
representative of those who attend the home-
coming celebration.
As spokesman of the 2010 Gator Growl,
I am extremely pleased to announce to theBryan Griffin
Speaking OutStudent Body that we
will be continuing the
system of general body
input on talent choices
for this year's show.
However, this year we have increased and
expanded the survey process, and we have
made it even more accessible to anyone who
wish to give opinions and suggestions for the
upcoming show.
Simply use the following link, http://
www.surveymonkey.com/s/Growl20l0, and
fill out the suggestion survey. It takes about
five minutes, and it is submitted directly to
the Gator Growl 2010 staff for review uponcompletion.
By submitting the survey, you are auto-
matically entered into a chance to win two
free Gator Growl tickets for this year's show.
We would love to see more students and fac-
ulty fill out the survey than we had last year.
Since booking talent requires extremely
early planning, please try to fill out the sur-
veys as soon as possible.
Soon, we will begin compiling the results
and pursuing the available suggestions to cre-
ate an even bigger and better Gator Growl
show this year.
Bryan Griffin is a guest columnist and 2010
Gator Growl spokesman.

UF forward Chandler Parsons is the team's leading rebounder in South-
eastern Conference play, averaging 7.4 boards per game.
UF TENNISUF benefitting
from Parsons
new versatility
0 THE JUNIOR IS AVERAGING CAREER HIGHS
IN POINTS, REBOUNDS AND ASSISTS.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Chandler Parsons garnered plenty of praise earlier
this season for his late-game heroics, but he has proven
to be adept at far more than just last-second 75-footers
and buzzer-beating three-pointers.
Parsons posted an 18-point, 12-rebound, six-assist
performance in Florida's 69-62 win over Mississippi
State on Saturday, displaying his versatility through-
out his team-high 33 minutes of play.
The 6-foot-9 junior crashed the boards for a game-
high five offensive rebounds, got to the free-throw line
more than any other player on the court and spent
some time at point guard -a far cry from the outside-
shooting perimeter player he was a year ago.
Parsons' teammates aren't surprised by the way he
has developed a better all-around game this season.
"s knew Chandler was capable because he does it for
us every day in practice," sophomore point guard Erv-
ing Walker said. "It was just a question of him putting
it all together and putting it out there on the court."
No longer playing in the shadow of former UF
and high school teammate Nick Calathes, Parsons has
stepped up and taken on more responsibilities. The
most noticeable change has been his intensity on the
glass.
Parsons is averaging 6.7 rebounds per game, second
on the team behind Alex Tyus' 6.9. Also, he leads the
team with 7.4 boards per game in Southeastern Confer-
ence play, including a team-high 22 offensive rebounds
in the Gators'nine league games.
"On the offensive boards, it'd be tough to keep me
off if I keep going hard," Parsons said. "At my position,
I feel like I should be rebounding like this."
UF coach Billy Donovan said he thought Parsons
has always been a talented rebounder, but the junior

Gators prepare for ITA Tourney with easy win over Bulls
By ANDREW OLSON
Alligator Writer
Coach Roland Thornqvist wanted to see
how his No. 7 Gators would respond to the
test of a talented USF, and they aced it.
Florida (6-0) topped the No. 43 Bulls, the
highest-ranked team it has faced in the dual-
match season.
"We played very well once again,"
Thornqvist said. "We've done what we weresupposed to be doing leading up to the Na-
tional Indoors."
Freshman Lauren Embree returned to the
lineup and helped secure the doubles point
on court No. 2 with senior Anastasia Revzi-
na in an 8-3 victory.
Embree gave credit to her teammate.
"Nas (Revzina) set it up really well," Em-
bree said. "We have great chemistry out
there."
Freshman Caroline Hitimana and sopho-
more Joanna Mather on Court 3 had alreadyclinched the doubles point when the No. 26
doubles team of freshman
Allie Will and senior Mar-
rit Boonstra upset USF's
No. 8 pair of Melissa Kon-
ing and Irene Rehberger
8-5 on Court 1.
It was the second upset
of the dual-match season
Will for Boonstra and Will.
They defeated the No. 18
pair of MaCall Jones and Megan Price inFlorida's match against BYU on Jan. 29.
Monday's match served as a good pre-
view for the level of the competition that
will be featured at the ITA Team Indoor
Championship in Madison, Wis.
"I'm glad our last doubles match before
Madison was against No. 8. It's definitely
great experience before playing so many
good teams," Boonstra said.

It was a down year for Super Bowl

as a huge disappointment.
The much-anticipated spot with

fell far short of the hype.
To be fair though, that's not re-

It wasn't super entertaining, but
it was at least heartfelt, and there
was an attempt at humor (which
also managed to generate contro-
versy with NOW).
That would have been in keep-
ing with the way this commercial
was talked about when it was an-
nounced a few weeks ago. People
lost their minds, and I was never re-

Was it because the Tebows are

women. They're right. I'd love to smack any members of the organization who

UF WOMEN'S GOLF
Gators in 10th after one round at Northrop Grumman
By KELSIE HOECHERL
Alligator Writer
After one round of play in the
Northrop Grumman Regional
Challenge in Palos Verdes, Calif.,
the Florida women's golf team fin-
ished tenth overall.
The team carded a 304,20 strokes
over par and 20 strokes behind the
number-one seed, Southern Cali-
fornia.
"This golf course is everything
you could ask for," coach Jan Dowl-
ing said. "You've got to drive the
ball great, you've got to hit great
iron shots and position yourself inthe right place. The greens are real-
ly fast and well protected so you've
got to chip a putt really well. To
come out and play this as your first
round of tournament golf for the
spring is a challenge."
Despite a foot injury, junior Jessi-
ca Yadloczky rose to that challenge,
leading the Gators with a Round 1
total of 73 (+2). She is currently 12th
in the tournament. Yadloczky came
out strong, in her third appearance
on this course, shooting an even par
on her first seven holes of the back
nine but followed up with back-to-
back bogeys.
"[Yadloczky] came out readyto play," Dowling said. "She had
been nursing a foot injury, so for
her to come out and play the way
she did today is great. She feels re-
ally comfortable
on this course,
it's her third year
playing [in Palos
Verdes] and it's
the kind of course
that requires
playing quite a
Dowling few rounds of
golf to get comfortable on. She took
advantage of that and I look for-
ward to watching her play the next
few days."Following four strokes behind
their team leader, sophomores
Marika Lendl and Evan Jensen and
freshman Mia Piccio each carded
scores of 77 (+6). The trio is cur-
rently tied for 39th place.
Lendl and Jensen started out
strong with three even par holes,
but started to struggle on the next
two holes with a double bogey and
a bogey.
Lendl went on to make two bird-
ies, another bogey and finished the
round with a double bogey.
Jensen finished with two birdies,
three bogeys, and another double
bogey to end her day."There are definitely things that
each one of our players can im-
prove on," Dowling said. "We're
just going to take it shot-by-shot
and day-by-day. That's really what
I thought was positive today, that
they did stay positive out there,
which is hard to do on such a tough
golf course."
Coming in last for the Gators
was freshman Isabelle Lendl who
carded 79 (+8) and tied for 55th.
She recorded a bogey on three of
her first five holes and entered the
next nine at three over. She finished
her round with a double bogey and
three more bogeys.
~iIlU'HO SHOTS Stats shown are from UFs games against Alabama
and Mississippi State
Parsons had one of the best
all-around performances of his career in
Florida's 69-62 win over Mississippi State on
Saturday, putting up 18 points, 12 rebounds,
six assists and two steals against the Bulldogs.
The 6-foot-9 forward is leading the team in
rebounds in Southeastern Conference play
with 7.4 per game, and he has taken on more
Chandler Parsons responsibility over the last three games, as UF
coach Billy Donovan has played him at point
guard to take the load off Erving Walker and Kenny Boynton.
Stats: 26 points, 7-of-13 shooting, 17 rebounds, 7 assists, 2
steals, 1 blockMacklin had only six points and
five rebounds against Alabama on
Thursday, but he dropped a career-
high 20 points against MSU. The
6-foot-10 center did so in impressive
fashion, outplaying Bulldogs center
Jarvis Varnado, one of the best big
men in the SEC and one of the best
Vernon Macklin Jr. shot-blockers in the game. Macklin
made 10 of his 14 field-goal at-
tempts and scored the Gators' first 10 points of the second
half, and his reverse dunk brought the O'Connell Center
crowd to its feet.

Tyus carried the Gators through the first half
of their 66-65 win against Alabama on Thursday
and finished with 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting
and seven rebounds. The power forward had 12
points in the opening 20 minutes, keeping UF within
striking distance while its backcourt struggled to
find its shot early on. He followed that up with
a disappointing 3-of-i12 shooting performance
lex Tyus against Mississippi State, but he still managed to
pull down eight boards against the Bulldogs.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 15
Only one match did not end in straight-set win for UF
TENNIS,from page 13 Forward helping out
with ballhandling
HOOPS, from page 13
has finally matured enough to turn his potential
into production on the court.
"What he thought went into becoming a good
player and a successful player was really way off-
base from what reality was," Donovan said.
Part of Parsons' improvement has been taking
on whatever role Donovan asks him to play. After
being used at both forward spots his first two years,
Parsons found himself at shooting guard this sea-
son due to the Gators' lack of natural guards.
Since the Tennessee game on Jan. 31, Donovan
has used his swingman in another position: point
guard.
Walker and freshman guard
Kenny Boynton have taken on
most of the ballhandling duties
Men's all season, but when the pressure
Basketball and physical demands became
too much to handle, Donovan
puts the ball in Parsons'hands.
"That's a lot for both Walker and Boynton to
handle," Donovan said. "With a lack of depth in
our backcourt, I've got to find some ways to relieve
those guys from being on the ball all the time."
Parsons' height allows him to see over the de-
fense more than the 5-foot-8 Walker and 6-foot-2
Boynton, and Donovan trusts his passing and his
ability to drive into the lane.
"If Erv and KB are getting pressured, I feel like
I'm a guy who's reliable," Parsons said. "I can get
my teammates involved, get to the basket and not
turn the ball over -just do whatever I can to help
the team."
M IKE, from page 13_
Was it because Pam chose not
to abort Tim? Everyone knows
that, too.
I guess people expected Tebow
and his mom to have war paint
on their faces and be screaming
about baby killers, but that's not
how the Tebows roll.
For as visible as they are with
their beliefs, they aren't pushy at
all, and hopefully people took that
away from the Super Bowl ad.They just use the stage that
fans and the media have set up for
them, largely in a quiet way, and
that's something they should be
applauded for.
Disagreeing with the underly-
ing message isn't really the issue.
It's not news that some people
are pro-life and some are pro-
choice, and if anything, this ad
should be a lesson in how we can
handle these debates in public.
No one has to be angry or force
their views on others, just offer achance for discussion.
That's what was done here, and
whether you agree or not with the
Tebows shouldn't really matter
when it comes to their commer-
cial.
The problem is, people always
have to take opinions on Tebow
to the extreme. He was called the
best college player ever before
even playing a full career.
When he got a concussion
against Kentucky, people flipped
out and acted like they knew ev-erything about his situation.
Now his delivery and ability to
read defenses is considered so ter-
rible that he can never function as
a productive NFL quarterback.
Why can't we just admit we
don't know?
No one knows if Tebow will
pan out at the next level, just like
no one really knew his post-con-
cussion status or what would be
in that Super Bowl commercial.
Given the amount of negative
attention it garnered beforehand,maybe Tebow would rather have
avoided any controversy and just
not done the ad, but I doubt it.
He wants to get his message
out there -and he's going to -
and there's no point in getting up-
set about it.
The only thing I would have
done differently was make the
commercial more entertaining.
Tebow rapping Kanye West's
"Hey Mama" in the background
while Pam talked would've done
the job.

52 Ecaterina Vasenina on Court 2 in straight
sets 6-2, 6-0.
Embree, who sat out Sunday, said her
shin has been bothering her, but after Mon-
day's match she said she felt "100 percent."
No. 15 Embree defeated USF's No. 77
Irene Rehberger in straight sets 6-3, 6-2 at
the No. 1 spot.
Earlier in the day, Thornqvist said he ex-
pected to see his Nos. 4-6 players tested by
USF's depth.
After the match, he said he felt Caroline
Hitimana on Court 5 was "not tested." She
won her match in straight sets 6-1, 6-1 fin-
ishing before the rest of her teammates.
Even with two freshmen ranked in the
top 15, Thornqvist has said this is Boonstra
and Revzina's team.
No. 92 Revzina won her match on Court
4 in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4.
Thornqvist thought Revzina played ex-
cellent in the first set, lost her focus in the
second set that became as close as 5-4, but
did not panic and managed to close it out
strong.
On Court 6, sophomore Claire Bartlett
was in the only match to go beyond two sets.
Since the victory was already clinched for
Florida after Bartlett and USF's Natalia Gue-
vara split their first two sets, they played a
tiebreaker instead of a full third set. Bartlett
won the tiebreaker 11-9.
Sunday's match against Troy and Mon-
day's match against USF was the Gators'
first time playing on back-to-back days.
At the ITA Team Indoor Championships,
beginning Friday, they will play at least
three matches in three days, or four in four
days if they advance to the championship
round on Monday.Steven H. Keys / Alligator Statt
