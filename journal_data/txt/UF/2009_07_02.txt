 A statue of a turtle modeled after UF quarterback Tim Tebow sits at a street corner two blocks from 
Jacksonville Municipal Stadium, the stadium where the annual UF-Georgia football game is played.

 Part football legend, part sea tur-
tle and a little bit of alligator, Tebow 
Turtle marks territory claimed by the Gators in last year’s UF-Georgia game.
The roughly 5-foot-tall, ﬁ  berglass 
statue stands outside the Veterans Memorial Arena, about two blocks from Jacksonville Municipal Stadi-um, where the Gators and Bulldogs ﬁ  ght out their heated rivalry every 
fall.
It features Tim Tebow’s signature 
“Phil 4:13” under its eyes, which he 
wore when the Gators rolled the Bulldogs 49-10 in 2008, and an alli-gator tail to represent UF’s mascot.
 “We really just wanted to cele-
brate Tim,” said Bonnie Upright, the coordinator for Turtle Trails, the or-
ganization which placed the statue. 
“This town loves him.”
However, Tebow Turtle won’t 
be around to greet Gator fans this October.“He will be gone before the Flori-
da-Georgia game, but if not, I would probably move him anyway,” Up-right said, fearing that the statue may be vandalized.
The statue is one of 24 turtles 
placed around Jacksonville as part 
of Turtle Trails, a fundraiser for 
Jacksonville organization Child Guidance Center that provides men-tal health services to children and families.
In March 2008, individuals and 
companies could sponsor a turtle for $5,000. The cost paid for production and artist fees, she said.
This October, Turtle Trails will 
auction off the turtle statues and all proceeds will go to the Child Guid-ance Center.
Several turtles did not receive 
sponsorships, Tebow Turtle among them.
But Upright decided to have one 
of the extra turtles designed like 
Tebow because she knew it would 
do well at auction, she said. 
“We knew that a Tim Tebow 
turtle would generate a lot of atten-tion,” she said.

 UF employees are now required to wear a 
helmet while operating university-provided 
bicycles, scooters, mopeds, Segways and mo-torcycles.
The helmets must meet standards set by 
the U.S. Department of Transportation and should be securely fastened, the policy states.
While employee safety is always a concern, 
the policy is only aimed at employees using the vehicles for campus transportation, said 
William Properzio, director of UF’s Environ-
mental Health and Safety Division. 
Administrative supervisors who ask em-
ployees to use particular vehicles in work-related activities are responsible for enforcing the policy, he said. 
Though the policy only requires helmets for 
on-the-job situations, it states, “UF employees are strongly encouraged to wear their helmets 
whenever they ride.” 
“I always wear a helmet and wish everyone 
on two wheels wore a helmet,” said Norman 
Lewis, an assistant professor in the College of Journalism and Communications who com-mutes to and from campus by bicycle. 
Lewis said he was spared potential brain 
injuries after a scooter accident in 2007 because of his helmet. The accident seriously damaged 
his ribs, and his head bounced on the pave-
ment, he said.
“Yes, helmets can look dorky,” Lewis said. 
“But I value my mind too much to let it be un-protected.” New policy requires UF employees to wear helmetsSEE TEBOW, PAGE 10SEE FIREWORKS, PAGE 10 By THOMAS STEWART

 Three robberies involving students 
that occurred over the last week are be-ing investigated by the Gainesville Po-lice Department.
According to police, three happened 
in the downtown area and one occurred in Midtown. All four students were ap-proached by unidentiﬁ  ed men who stole the three female victims’ purses and the male victim’s wallet and cell phone.
Lt. Mike Schibuola said in all four cases, the victims waited until they got home to call the police. 
“When someone tries to take your 
purse from you, that is a robbery,” Schibuola said. “We take robberies very seriously.”
Schoboula recommends that victims 
of robberies call 911 immediately after the incident if they still have their cell phones.

city of Jacksonville. An article in 
Tuesday’s paper stated otherwise.  UF ATHLETICS
UF may add safe zones near

UF and Jacksonville may add 
more safe zones outside Jackson-
ville Municipal Stadium this year 
during the UF-Georgia game.
Officials from the two parties, 
including UF President Bernie Ma-
chen and Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton, met Wednesday to talk about ways to make the scene out-side the stadium safer.
Two UF students died while at-
tending the game in recent years, 
one in 2004 and one in 2005.
The zones have been in place 
for the past three years. They offer 
things like first aid, water, snacks, coffee, phone service, universal cell phone chargers and directions for lost fans.
Patricia Telles-Irvin, UF’s vice 
president of Student Affairs, said students have been appreciative of the safe havens, with more than 300 people using them last year.

More than 1 billion people in the world 
live below the poverty level, but, in fall 2010, 
UF will be one of the world’s first universi-ties trying to change that.
The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation awarded UF nearly $1 million to create a new master’s program that will 
train students to assist impoverished popu-
lations. 
The foundation has donated $7.6 mil-lion to 10 universities worldwide to develop these master’s programs over the next three years.  
UF received the donation after compet-
ing against 70 other applicant universities worldwide. 
In North America, only UF and Emory 
University in Atlanta, were awarded grants from the foundation.
The curriculum, emphasizing practical 
experience in the field, will consist of cours-es in management and in the natural, health 
and social sciences,.
The program, jointly administered by the centers for Latin American and African stud-
ies, will have relatively small class sizes.
“We anticipate admit-
ting some 20 students per class; since it will be a two-year program, this means 
some 40 would be enrolled 
at a given time once the 
program is up and run-
ning,” said Leonardo Vil-
lalón, director of the Cen-
ter for African Studies at UF.
In addition to the foundation’s large do-
nation, UF has committed to spend approxi-mately $800,000 over the next four years on the program, he said. 
Although the program’s first students 
won’t enroll until Fall 2010, the centers for African and Latin American studies are al-locating time to prepare for the program.  
UF plans to partner with various Latin 
American universities and the University of Botswana. 
“Poverty is such a huge global problem. 
I’m surprised a program like this hasn’t been created before,” said Aaron Clossey, a UF 
senior. “It’s a great step in ensuring global 
improvement for the future.”UF A cAdEMicsUF seeks to eliminate poverty with $1M grant

Budget cuts won’t prevent stu-
dents from mixing cocktails or 
throwing pottery this summer.
Home bartending and begin-
ning throwing, along with par-rot care and training and salsa dancing are a few of the 38 Reitz Union Leisure Courses offered 
during Summer B.
Beth Waltrip, director for cam-
pus programs, said the courses 
are funded independently, “so we don’t have to worry about budget cuts affecting which classes we can offer.”
All of the courses, offered year-
round, have registration fees av-eraging between $25 and $50 and a possible lab fee, Waltrip said.
Anyone in the community can 
register, but UF students will re-ceive a discount. UF class prices cost less than similar classes of-fered outside of the university, 
Waltrip said.
The home bartending course, 
which requires students to be at 
least 21 years old, has a $50 reg-istration fee and a $40 lab fee, 
which covers the cost of alcohol 
and mixers. 
John “Wanton” Gillooly wants his students to learn not only how to make different drinks but also 
how to drink responsibly.
“I want them to learn about 
quality versus quantity,” he said. 
Like all Summer B leisure 
classes, the course lasts four 
weeks. Students will learn about wines, beers, proper mixers and 
how to watch out for date-rape 
drugs.Gillooly said his students will 
know more about alcohol than 
90 percent of the bartenders in 
town.
Students can also suggest 
classes they’d like to see offered by going on the leisure course 
Web site and filling out a leisure 
course proposal.
Greg Fink, a second-year jour-
nalism major, said he would like 
a skateboarding class offered, 
because it’s something he has al-ways wanted to learn.
“I also think I would take 
quilting,” he said jokingly. “That 
could be useful, right?”

sure courses is July 6.Courses teach home bartending, quilting

Monica Kraft and her fiancé, John 
Waldo, had been together for seven 
years. They planned to get married.
But those plans were changed 
after Waldo, 42, was found dead in the backseat of his silver BMW at 1933 NW 2nd Ave. on Feb. 23.  The 
car was ticketed seven times before 
he was found. He had been missing 
since Feb. 11.
Waldo’s body was discovered by 
UF student Chris Cianfaglione, who 
said he had to press his face against the window of the car to see inside because of its illegal tint.
“All they had to do was punch in 
that tag number, and it would have 
showed where he was,” Kraft said.
Kraft wants to create the Waldo Law, which, if passed, would re-quire Florida law enforcement agen-
cies to run the vehicle identification 
and tag number of an abandoned 
vehicle that is being ticketed.“He spent 12 days in his car,” 
Kraft said. “We believe he was in a 
coma for the first couple of days. But 
if they had ran his tag after the first 
ticket, he would still be alive.”
Kraft said she recently met with 
city officials and Gainesville Police Department Capt. Ed Book to dis-cuss preventing  situations like this.
Kraft also thinks making park-
ing officials or police officers look 
in what seems to be an abandoned 
car.“It takes just one second out of a 
person’s day who is going around 
giving tickets to look into the win-
dow and see if something is in 
there,” she said.  “A dog. A cat. A 
baby. A person.” 
The city government has dis-
cussed requiring officers to inspect 
vehicles after their third ticket, but 
Kraft believes this is insufficient.
The city Public Works Supervi-
sor, Trish Everitt, said she was un-
able to comment. Body found in abandoned car inspires push for law
A Gainesville apartment fire destroyed one town-
house, leaving it uninhabitable, and damaged two 
adjacent townhouses Tuesday.
Angela Frick, the resident of unit 61 at Woodland 
Villas, 5950 SW 20th Ave., was moving in when card-board boxes in the kitchen caught fire, said Carol 
Davis, Alachua County Fire Rescue 
spokeswoman.
Someone had turned on the stove 
burners while the electricity was off.  
When the unit’s electricity was turned on, the burner 
ignited the boxes. At about 1:20 p.m., ACFR received 
a call alerting them about the fire.
When the firefighters got to the complex, apart-
ment 61 was engulfed in flames.
They were able to put the fire out within 15 to 20 
minutes of arriving at the complex.
Unit 61 is no longer habitable. 
But people can continue to live in the two adjacent 
apartments, which only suffered smoke damage, Da-vis said.
There was $90,000 in damage to the building and 
$5,000 in property damage.

More than 100 people have felt 
up Amanda Jones. 
But Amanda is sacrificing her 
dignity for the good of medicine.
A cross between an avatar and 
a mannequin, Amanda prepares medical students for tough exams 
in the field.
Benjamin Lok, assistant profes-
sor of computer and information 
sciences and engineering at UF, said he has been working on the idea of a mixed-reality patient for about two years.
“Intimate exams can be uncom-fortable for medical students to 
do at first,” Lok said. “I figured if 
we could find new technology for them to use as practice, it would save time and money.”
Jones’ physical form, a manne-
quin with a prosthetic breast that students can perform physical ex-ams on, is immobile. Her virtual form is a life-sized computer ava-
tar that communicates via speech 
and gestures on a large flat-screen television mounted above her “body.”
Lok said medical educators 
write the words Jones uses to con-verse back and forth with medical students. Each script focuses on a realistic situation that the doctors 
want the students to learn how to 
handle properly.
“A doctor’s response to certain 
situations is vital to patients,” Lok said. “How can you give students a chance to gain experience with-out giving them plenty of oppor-tunities to practice?” 
Lok said that other medical col-
leges have expressed interest in learning more about the project, but that the idea for the virtual 
human first began at UF. 
He has been working with Dr. 
D. Scott Lind from the University 
of Georgia and Dr. Carla Pugh, a breast cancer specialist at North-western University, to help make the idea of mixed-reality humans a possibility in the medical field.
Lok said that even though 
they are still in the research stage, the ultimate goal is to get these mixed-reality patients out to other medical schools.Aaron Kotranza, a research as-
sistant in the computer and infor-mation sciences and engineering program, built the simulator that gives Jones her voice.
“Some of the medical students 
feel weird talking to her, but oth-ers will try to comfort the patient by touching her,” Kotranza said.
He said one of the main goals 
of the mixed-reality humans is to help improve the students’ non-verbal behaviors and interper-sonal skills.
“It’s not just about asking the 
right questions — it’s about how you make the patient feel,” he said. “We want to prepare today’s medical students to have excellent 
communication skills, as well as 
medical expertise.”
While Amanda has not yet 
been tested at UF, between 100 and 120 medical students from the Medical College of Georgia have tested a duplicate of the technol-ogy, Kotranza said, and the re-sponse has been overwhelmingly 
positive.
UF medical sophomore Elise 
Springer said she is eager to use 
the technology.
“It’s lifelike, taking the idea of 
practicing on a dummy and ex-panding on it,” she said, “as well as the opportunity to fine-tune your physical exam.”
“Students react to her in differ-
ent ways, but they always learn something,” Kotranza said.
“Before you fly an airplane, 
simulation plays a very strong role in preparation. It’s the same with medicine. It’s a safe place to fail.”THURSDAY, JULY 2, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Darts & Laurels
For duping the Egyptian government into paying a 
pretty penny for some pretend poultry, the Editorial Board 
flings its first DART of Summer B at Alexander Legault. 
The 59-year-old man admitted Wednesday to scamming the nation out of more than $7 million for an order of 5,000 metric tons of frozen chicken. That’s more than 11 million pounds of chicken-sicles. How Costco-esque.
News out of Fort Myers, Fla., tells the story of a young 
girl believed to have come in contact with a rabid bat ly-ing dead on a beach. For kissing and playing with the de-ceased animal, the Editorial Board launches a LAUREL at 
Bat Girl. The Board does not condone playing with dead animals, especially ones testing positive for rabies, howev-er, we are eagerly waiting to read the love story destined for publication in the Weekly World News. It’s about time Bat Boy scored himself a girlfriend. Hopefully he doesn’t mind a little mouth foam.
For undressing on an airplane, causing a U.S. Airways 
plane flying from Charlotte, N.C., to Los Angeles to make an unexpected landing in Albuquerque, N.M., the Editorial Board issues a lame-attempt-at-joining-the-mile-high-club DART to Keith Wright, 50. After Wright was arrested and 
the plane prepared to depart from Albuquerque, flight at-tendants reminded the 138 inconvenienced passengers to keep their seat belts fastened... and their clothes on.
In Gainesville, the Department of Darts & Laurels 
awards a would-you-like-your-eggs-for-here-or-to-go? LAUREL to Alexis Dominguez, who broke into the Phi 
Kappa Tau fraternity house Thursday and made eggs and cheese. Dominguez, 46, entered the house by removing the air conditioner and crawling through the window. He said he committed the crime because he was hungry. He was arrested after he left the eggs on the burner too long and 
set off the fire alarm.
Doesn’t sound over-easy to us.
As the King of Pop’s death pushed even news from Iran 
out of the spotlight, another king passed away. King of infomercials Billy Mays passed away on Sunday morning. After his death, his son used Twitter to share memories and thoughts with his father’s fans. And so in the deal of the century, the Department of Darts & Laurels presents two LAURELS for the price of one to Billy Mays for prov-
ing time after time his products were missing from our 
apartments and to Billy Mays III for working through his 
grief with his father’s fans to remember the pitch king. 
Tim Allen said in “Galaxy Quest” to “never give up, 
never surrender.” As hard as it is to disagree with the Tool Man, sometimes you just have to throw in the towel. FSU is again appealing its forced vacation of wins by the NCAA for its academic cheating scandal, despite a more than 20-page shellacking in law-speak after its first appeal 
(Yes, we read through every page). For wasting its time 
with a second appeal and threatening the reputation of a 
university and a coach, who will be remembered fondly 
whether the wins stay or go, the Department of Darts & Laurels sends a DART to the school out west.

There are those rare moments that, in one fell swoop, 
remind us all of the ephemerality and fragility of life and, generally speaking, those moments come 
after a loss. We have all just experienced one of those mo-ments — only this time it dragged on for days. In the span of one week, we lost Ed McMahon, Farrah Fawcett, Michael Jackson and Billy Mays. All of them American 
icons and, now, all of them gone.
McMahon was 86 years old, and so his departure 
didn’t come as a shock. Fawcett had long been battling 
cancer. These deaths, while saddening, were accepted largely with equanimity. But on the same day that Fawc-
ett departed, so too did the ‘King of Pop,’ Jackson, at the 
age of 50. 
In my depression, I wondered sardonically, “Who’s 
next?”
The answer came quickly enough. Mays, the colorful 
and exuberant TV salesman of OxiClean, was unexpect-edly found dead in his bed a mere three days later.
It is official, what we experienced was an apocalypse 
of the gods. 
McMahon had brought laughter to audiences for 
decades, both intentionally as Johnny Carson’s second-banana and unintentionally while toting his oversized Publisher’s Clearing House checks. Fawcett had thrilled 
men and earned the anger of women during her time 
on “Charlie’s Angels” and with her famous pin-up pho-tos. Jackson is such a legend that hardly a word need be written — whatever legal troubles and eccentricities he may have had, the man was the single most successful 
entertainer of all time and the inventor of the moonwalk 
(could you have done that?). Finally, Mays, though prob-ably the least known of the group, was no less the icon, undoubtedly one of the most suc-cessful salesman ever. He elevated the sales pitch to an art form. These 
people were, each in their own way, 
American heroes.
For that very reason, this is not 
a time for sadness. The lives these 
people lived were filled with suc-
cesses and failures, triumphs and 
defeats, acclaims and criticisms. But they were, each of them, larger than life. Right now, somewhere in this great country, there is an old-timer impersonating McMahon’s 
famous “hi-oh!”; a young girl twirling her blond locks 
like Fawcett; a salesman attempting to mimic the thun-derous shouts Mays and — this I guarantee you — a young man grabbing his crotch and attempting to moon-
walk. It will be a long time before any of these icons are 
forgotten. That’s just the way it is in America: the gods may leave us, but the shrines remain.
I am inclined to believe that, if we should feel pity for 
anyone, it should be for ourselves and not these luminar-
ies who have left us. They enriched our lives at every turn 
and were not afraid to live their own in front of cameras. It takes a special kind of person to be a true celebrity. And I don’t mean in the cheap, Paris Hilton sense of the 
word, but rather in the sense that brings with it grandeur 
and class and a spark of unique personality. I call that trait charm, and each of them had it.
And, also, can someone with the funds available 
please put a security detail around Jack Nicholson? I 
won’t let him be next.

The House recently passed the 
American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES), an im-
portant step toward protecting our environment and building a clean 
energy economy.
ACES has generated a lot of 
strong opinions, for and against, es-
pecially in the environmental com-munity. Now I personally helped start and run the Energy Action Coalition, the largest youth clean en-ergy organization in the country but following the debate over the 1,200-
page proposal has been confusing 
even for me.
In an open letter to the president and members of Congress, 20 of the top climatologists in the country wrote, “At its best it will be only a first step,” and, “Call attention to the large difference between what U.S. 
politics now seems capable of enact-
ing and what scientists understand is necessary to prevent climatic dis-ruption and protect the human fu-ture.”
I deeply respect individuals on 
both sides of the debate, and, in the end, I believe both sides are right. (Sounds strange...)
The science, at least, is pretty 
clear. The safe upper limit to atmo-spheric carbon dioxide is 350 parts per million (ppm). Right now, we’re at 389 ppm and 
climbing. In its current form, ACES 
will not take us below 350. Most 
agree with that. On the other hand, the latest study by the Congressio-nal Budget Office reports that ACES will create 1.7 million new jobs and save consumers more than $22 bil-lion in 2020 alone. According to the Center for American Progress, by 2020 the act will have the same effect 
on global warming as removing 500 
million cars from the road. That’s nothing to sneeze at.So I’m looking forward, not back. 
Ultimately our goals should be to avert a climate crisis and to build a vibrant clean energy economy. Does ACES bring us closer to reaching 
those goals? Yes. Will it bring us 
there on its own? Certainly not. 
We need to strengthen ACES as 
much as possible before it becomes law. The oil and coal industries have spent heavily to weaken the propos-al — $79 million lobbying Congress in just the first three months of 2009. 
Second, we need to view ACES 
as the foundation of good national and international climate policy, not the final product. To truly jump-start a clean energy economy, we need a range of complementary policies. President Obama has already made headway in this area, most notably with the increase in fuel-economy 
standards.
Finally, and perhaps most impor-
tantly, we need to unite as a nation to 
face this challenge. If anyone in this country has proven able to inspire us to fully embrace our civic and moral responsibilities, it’s President Obama.  I believe that his leadership will stir the nation into action.

Energy bill needs strengthening before becoming U.S. lawU.S. should offer paid sick days to every American worker
For most Americans, the Fourth of July 
is a day for fireworks, concerts, parades and all manner of patriotic displays. It’s 
as American as barbecue ribs and apple pie.
While many enjoy a paid day off for the 
holiday, not everyone is so lucky. Paid days off from work are rare. When it’s a holiday, at least the time off is taken for fun, but when employees need time off for illness or care-giving, even fewer can afford it.
Nearly 60 million American workers lack 
a single paid sick day to care for themselves when occasional illness strikes. Those who must go to work sick not only jeopardize their 
own well-being but also threaten the public 
health. In early June, the World Health Orga-nization announced that the world is officially in the grip of a global H1N1 swine flu pan-demic. In light of the U.S. outbreak, President Barack Obama and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously stated that 
those with flu symptoms should stay home 
from school and work, see a doctor and avoid public contact until they recover.
But American workers without paid sick 
days cannot stay home because they risk los-ing their jobs. This is no inconsequential threat when you consider the impact on the public health.
And neither is it inconsequential when you 
consider the impact of the lack of paid sick days on working families generally — espe-cially in these trying economic times.
Consider Asha C., 
a young mother in 
Milwaukee, Wis. As a temporary hire, Asha 
had no paid sick days and could be fired for 
missing work — even if she or her children were ill. One day, she was sick and called in to say that she would be late that day. Asha came to work one hour late. Two men escorted her to a large meeting room. They informed her that she was fired. The employer’s actions not only caused her to lose her job but to miss payment of her rent and other household bills. It took a 
while for Asha to find another job. The second, 
like the first, included no paid sick days.It’s stories like Asha’s that add urgency to 
the need for paid sick time.
This is about working families. This is 
also about staying competitive as a nation in the global economy. Nineteen of the 20 most 
competitive countries in the world guarantee 
paid sick days. The United States is the odd one out.
It’s great to celebrate our country’s history 
and values. But for the celebrating to be truly authentic, every American worker must have paid sick days.

By ALEX CHACHKEVITCH
Alligator Writer
When Tim Hussin’s sister 
handed him a 35mm camera in 
high school, he thought photog-raphy would just be a hobby.  
But eight years later, Hussin was 
named the best college photogra-
pher in the nation at the annual William Randolph Hearst Na-tional Photojournalism Champi-onship held in San Francisco.
Hussin was chosen from 12 
semi-finalists to compete in a fi-nal “Shoot-out.”
For his assignment, Hus-
sin spent a day at Fisherman’s Wharf. 
He said he always gravitated 
to water since he was a child, liv-ing in Palm Harbor by the coast 
and frequently fishing with his 
dad.
“It was amazing out there [in 
the water]. For some people it’s 
a lifestyle,” he said, adding that 
he tries to aim for subtlety in his work and likes capturing photos that make people think beyond the superficial. 
John Freeman, a UF photo-
journalism professor, said Hussin was already a talented photogra-
pher when he came to his begin-
ning class.Freeman said he first saw 
Hussin’s work at The Indepen-
dent Florida Alligator, where he 
started out as a freelance photog-rapher and later was hired.
“I told him, ‘So you’re the 
guy. I’ve been seeing your name in [the Alligator]; you’re already pretty good,” Freeman said, re-calling the first time he met Huss-in. “And [he answered], ‘Really?’ 
He was embarrassed and humble 
about it.”
Freeman also flew to San Fran-
cisco to support Hussin, who was 
also named College Photographer 
of the Year by the University of Missouri School of Journalism last November. 
The title comes with a Nation-
al Geographic magazine intern-ship, which Hussin will start in September.
Hussin is interning with mul-
timedia agency MediaStorm in New York. 
But Hussin didn’t realize he 
wanted to pursue photogra-phy professionally until college.  
When he was a freshman, his ma-jor was environmental science. 
“I didn’t know what I wanted 
to do , like most other freshmen,” 
he said.
Photojournalism grabbed his 
attention after taking Introduc-
tion to Journalism in order to in-
tegrate his interest in science with 
something more expressive. 
Hussin said he drew inspi-ration from music, literature, his photojournalism professors, 
Freeman and John Kaplan and 
his friends.
Hussin said he tries to ex-
pose himself to different people who have interesting ideas and a unique outlook on life.
“I guess I have that drive,” he 
said, speaking of his passion for photography. 
Hussin competed in the Hearst competition last year and didn’t win, he said, which was disap-
pointing.
“But I knew I had another year 
to try,” he said. “And behold—I 
won.”
Danielle Rossi doesn’t find Chinese as difficult 
as she thought she would, partly because she loves 
China.
Rossi, an international economics major at Santa 
Fe College, is the first Santa Fe student to receive the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, 
which was designed for students wanting to study abroad in a non-European country and learn a non-traditional language. 
She will use the $5, 000 she 
was awarded to study Chinese at Jilin University in Changchun in northeastern China from Sept. 1 
through April 15. 
“I’ve always dreamed of 
studying internationally,” Rossi said. “(The Gilman scholarship) really gives community college stu-dents a chance to compete. They’re great for that.”
Rossi, who plans to go into international law or 
the U.S. Foreign Service, said after taking economics classes and realizing China’s importance in world affairs, learning Chinese seemed like good prepara-tion for the future. 
“We are such strong partners,” she said. “Eco-
nomically, we are linked at the hip.” 
Rossi said although she is excited, she’s wor-
ried about communicating and adjusting to life in 
China. 
“It will really be the Chinese culture,” she said. 
“It’s not Americanized.”

Turtle part of fundraiser for Family Health Servicesof WRUF and WUFT, which usually help organize the event.
The City of Gainesville also shelled out $6,000.Though UF’s new bandshell won’t host any Fourth of July 
festivities this year, the new structure will likely drive down costs for future shows Dankner said.
Now that organizers won’t have to rent a stage, the price 
tag could be about $10,000 lighter than the usual $35,000 to $45,000 pricetag, Dankner said.
When all is said and done, the new bandshell is expected 
to cost about $850,000. About half the money will come from the Capital Improvement Trust Fund, which is supported by student fees at state universities, and the other half will come from UF’s Activity & Service Fee, paid by UF students’ tu-ition.
The bandshell began as a $20,000 idea for an outdoor on-
campus concert venue in 1975.
Costs ballooned to more than $150,000 as the project un-
folded, prompting questions about the necessity of the venue, according to Alligator archives.
Construction began in 1978 and was completed in 1980, 
though the first concerts were held there in the fall of 1979.
The original bandshell, designed by two UF grad students, 
was torn down in March after it became unusable because 
of rotting wood and termite damage in the roof, said project manager Miles Albertson.
Concerns about the safety of the structure were nothing 
new, though.
Soon after it was built, a UF professor told the Alligator 
the wood was already beginning to rot and wouldn’t last five 
years unless it was treated.
In response, Student Government hired a company to treat 
the wood, forking over about $10,000.
Though there have been rumors that the old A-frame roof 
was actually from a Howard Johnson, Alligator articles from the time of its construction don’t support that notion.
Ed Poppell, UF’s vice president for Business Affairs, also 
discounts the idea.
“(S)afe to say it was built for this structure even though it 
was a unique roof,” he wrote in an e-mail.
The new metal roof is flat.Though the bandshell might be new and improved, some 
question whether it was necessary.
Danielle Panagos, who graduated from UF in May, said 
she thinks the cost is too high, especially when UF is cutting 
its state-funded budget by about $42 million.
“There’s probably a million other places that money could 
go,” she said.
Panagos compared the structure to UF’s proposal to install 
hand scanners at the gyms.
“It’s not really necessary,” she said.Completed bandshell could lower future costs

with the statue before having it made.
Justin Rose, and artist from Macclen-
ny, Fla., was approached to design the turtle, and he accepted without hesita-
tion, he said.
“I admire Tebow because of the kind 
of person that he is and the values that 
he has,” Rose said.
To prepare for the project, Rose said that he read several versions of Tebow’s 
biography and referenced pictures of 
the quarterback’s cleats, alligator tails and turtle faces.He worked for 14 hours a day for the 
first eight days and finished after about a month. He estimated the project took about 200 hours.
“When it was gone, it was almost like 
trying to drop an addiction,” he said.
Ashley Beck, a UF graduate and 
event coordinator for the city of Jack-sonville, said she was impressed by the authenticity of the details on the turtle.
“I think it’s really neat how they in-
corporated everything,” she said.rossi

  Maino — “If Tomorrow 
Comes…”
Maino sums up the spirit of his debut album with the line “When I think 
that I can’t / I envision 
Obama / I envisionthose diamonds / I envision 
Ferraris.” Inspiring, but ultimately matrialistic, the disc peaks with “All The Above ft. T-Pain.” mid-way through. 
 With his eyes closed and guitar pick cradled loosely between his 
index ﬁ  nger and thumb, Tony Centurione stands on a white-lit 
stage, covering a song by the band 
he sports on his T-shirt. 
“Bertha, don’t you come around 
here anymore,” he sings, strumming his electric guitar. 
A blonde girl spins on the dance 
ﬂ  oor, attempting to recruit a partner. In a dark corner two friends argue about the meaning of the song; is it 
about a mechanical fan or an actual 
woman? It was 1971 when “Bertha” was ﬁ  rst performed, and 38 years later it still absorbs an audience.
Beside Centurione, bandmate 
Andrew Strach plucks at his bass guitar, leaning back and forth, into the spotlight and out. His long curly hair copies the movements 
of his body. The ﬁ  rst time Strach 
met Centurione, it was another Grateful Dead T-shirt that sparked a conversation between the  strangers. They have come a long way from the days of playing bluegrass in the back bedroom of  Strach’s house. 
They have formed a band.After the show, the guys sit side-
by-side in the living room of that same house, UFO Hunters turned on consuming all of their attention. Two other bandmates lounge around the coffee table full of McDonald’s cheeseburger wrappers, pleading for a channel change.
“Dude, please,” Zach Liebman 
said, taking a sip of his beer. “This 
is so fake. I can’t even believe you 
buy this crap.” The drummer rarely ﬁ  nishes a sentence without tossing the word dude into it. His friends describe him as “the chillest person you’ll ever meet.”
Brandt Collings nods his head 
in agreement. He is more reserved than the rest of the band, though 
onstage he sings most of the band’s 
original songs. When he does speak, it’s about the Grateful Dead, Phish or String Cheese Incident. A “Steal Your Face” emblem sticks to the side of his electric guitar when he plays, displaying his devotion to the Grateful Dead.
“That’s how we all met,” he said. 
“We all love music, and we’ve kind of connected that way.”
Except for Scott Baltz, the 
keyboard player, who is absent from the room. He was recruited on Craigslist. 
The band debuted on June 28, 
2008, at an outdoor music festival arranged by friends in Ocala . The 
event was dubbed Jamnaldo.  
Liebman describes Jamnaldo as a 
casual event, with a huge stage and 
a setting that looks like something out of the movie Pan’s Labyrinth; creepy, but a huge success.
“We rocked it,” Centurione said. After Jamnaldo, the band began 
playing a bi-weekly spot at Tim and 
Terry’s. A manager there heard their 
ﬁ  rst performance and gave them the chance to play at the bar.
“Once we cut our teeth with Tim and Terry’s we started getting into bigger things,” Centurione said. 
Since then, the band has 
performed at Common Grounds and Market Street, opening for 
bigger acts like Dubconscious and 
Perpetual Groove.
“Which was pretty much the 
pinnacle of my life so far,” Liebman said. “No no, dude. I’m just kidding. But it was really cool.”
The guys classify their music as 
jam/funk/experimental, but Brandt said it’s really hard to put a label 
on the type of music that they play. 
Their covers include Talking Heads, String Cheese Incident, Phish, the Beatles, The Who, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan and of course the Grateful Dead.
Bassists Andrew Strach said that 
covering other bands is important to Juniper Spring because you can only 
play good music when you master 
good music ﬁ  rst.
“You’ve got to be an idiot not to 
want to build upon what rock’n’roll has been building for generations,” he said.
Now, the band plays a mix of 
covers and Juniper Spring originals.
“The fans have responded really 
well,” Andrew says. “I think they like us.”
The band has big aspirations of 
the future. 
“Our goal is to take over the 
world.” 
Centurione thinks for a second, 
then retracts this statement.
“No, just kidding. Ultimately, it’s 
to play music for a living,” he said.
The members agree that a 
nightly spot somewhere would be an ideal situation for Juniper Spring. “Playing with each other is reward enough though,” Strach said.
His bandmates tease him for his 
sappy comment, but then agree that it is true.
“I just want to play music that I 
love with these guys,” Centurione said. “If I could do that for a living, then that would be awesome.”

              Juniper SpringsA day in the life of...On Saturday it is time again to 
celebrate all that is the great U.S. 
But America’s birthday party is bound to be smaller this year as small city budgets and low mon-
etary contributions have led many 
cities to dwarf or even altogether cancel Independence Day celebra-tions.  
It’s not surprising when fire-
works displays themselves can cost upward of tens of thousands of dollars, an expense that penny pinchers describe as literally burn-
ing money. 
But while some cities tame their 
celebrations, others emphasize the 
importance of the day beyond just being an excuse to eat hot dogs and shamelessly wear head-to-toe red, white and blue. 
“The city of Alachua really fo-
cuses on supporting those that 
have fought for our freedom and 
celebrate those still fighting,” said Adam Boukari, an assistant at Ala-chua’s City Manager’s office. 
The annual Fourth of July Cel-
ebration is a 9-year-old tradition that the city was not ready to let 
go, despite potential monetary 
hardships. 
“We have been really for-
tunate. We have had the most cash and in-kind contribu-tions that we’ve had any other years.” Boukari said. “This has been our most succesful year by far.”
For the 10th annual Fourth 
of July celebration, the 16-mem-ber committee that puts to-gether the event is being more cautious with how money is spent, but the event will still be as big as ever. 
Attendees can still expect a 
30-minute, $ 30,000 fireworks dis-
play, live music, contests and a 
free Kidz Corner, complete with a skatepark, a bounce house and a 
splash park. 
The entire event is free and there 
is a 100-acre area for parking. 
The committee has been meet-
ing weekly since February to en-
sure the event runs smoothly. 
It takes a lot of work and plan-
ning, but the city is committed to 
continue the tradition and is proud 
to celebrate America’s freedom, 
Boukari said.  
The city will spend approxi-
mately $ 69,000 on the event, with $ 40,000 of the amount budgeted by the city, $18,000 contributed 
through cash donations and $ 11, 000 coming from in-kind dona-tions, in which businesses donate goods instead of cash.
“In tough times some cities cut 
back and I can understand that, but in our country there are still people overseas fighting and this 
is a way to remember them.” 
Boukari said. 
The celebration is also a good 
opportunity for local businesses and not-for-profit organizations to increase awareness and make money. 
“For some not-for-profits, this 
event is the biggest fundraiser of 
the year,” Boukari said. 
 The event is expected to  draw 
out a bigger crowd this year than it has in previous years because it is one of the only cities nearby host-ing a full day of activities and large fireworks display. Boukari said he expects between 
15 to 20,000 people to attend. 
Highlights of the festival in-
clude a fashion show, a rib-eating contest, and live music perfor-mances with Bryce Carlisle head-lining, he said. 
To beat the midsummer heat, 
the city set up an air-conditioned gymnasium filled with arts and 
crafts stations, vendors, live music 
and food. 
“We call the event ‘The Largest 
Small Town Fireworks Display in America’ because we really have a great show,” Boukari said. 
“For 30 minutes there is a con-
stant flow of fireworks, with no break, with music playing in the 
background and a field full of 
thousands of people watching.”
The celebration will be held Sat-
urday from 12 to 10 p.m., at the Hal Brady Recreation Complex, 14300 N.W. 146th Terrace, Alachua, Fla. THURSDAY, JULY 2, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 13

Vehicles provide protected medium to vent anger, rage
Road rage truly brings out the 
worst in us. All it takes is a Buick to cut me off during rush hour 
for me to rethink my position on social se-curity. 
I learned this lesson in ninth grade, 
when my older sister Katie would vent her 
stress at slow and indecisive drivers on the 
way to school in her Chevy Trailblazer.
We were already five minutes late 
to her volleyball game one day when a Dodge Caravan pulled in front of us to exit 
a parking lot. 
I instinctively sunk low in the passen-
ger seat, like a dog anticipating a rolled 
newspaper. 
After a two-minute, curse-filled rant about soccer moms, the Caravan’s white reverse lights glowed, 
and the vehicle rolled 
back toward us. To my sister, this meant war. 
The driver’s door 
swung open and a middle-aged black 
woman approached our car. 
 “I’m out of gas,” the woman calmly ex-
plained, “And I couldn’t get it over the hill to pull into the street. I need to back it up to roll it into that gas station.”
Katie ignored the politeness and stuck 
to her guns. 
“How am I supposed to reverse?” she 
barked, pointing to the long line of cars behind us.
But the woman, channeling Moses, 
waved her hand, and the cars miraculous-
ly receded in unison. 
My sister reversed and turned toward 
another exit. 
“There you go,” the woman said en-
couragingly. “That wasn’t so hard, was it?”
Big mistake. She may have had blue 
and gold spirit ribbons in her hair, but Ka-
tie was no child.
She jerked the car back into drive and 
huffed, “God, what a bitch!”
The woman’s smile vacated her face 
like a bystander in one of those old West-ern shoot-outs. 
“Excuse me?” she asked coldly.My sister slammed on the accelerator, the ‘Blazers’ tires screeching as we peeled out across the parking lot. Katie stuck her head out the window, her spirit ribbons 
flickering in the wind like flames.
“Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!”
Katie turned back, breathing heavily, 
her knuckles white on the steering wheel. 
“Katie, you’re racist,” I gasped from 
underneath the glove compartment. 
“I’m not racist. I’m not racist!”Katie isn’t — and wasn’t — racist. Road 
rage simply unleashes a beast inside all of 
us. 
Occasionally as I drive to work I’ll catch 
myself repeating terms I discovered as 
graffiti on public bathroom stalls. 
The truth is, a driver’s license doesn’t 
merely allow us to drive — it’s a license to hate.ERIK VOSS  � AVENUE WRITER�”The city of Alachua really focuses on

A lot goes into picking the 
perfect wedding. One has to 
consider location, tempera-ture, theme, guest list, and so 
on.  And this isn’t just the case 
for choosing The Wedding Dress, this is just for those for-tunate souls that get invited to partake in the celebration.  
Finding the perfect balance 
between being stylish and ap-propriate can be one of the most difficult fashion dilem-
mas of them all. 
And with summer being the 
peak of wedding season, right 
now you probably looking for the perfect attire and feeling slightly confused. Even for the most seasoned fashionistas, choosing the right dress for a wedding can be challenging. 
A little insight can help 
eliminate pre-wedding day jit-ters.
I’m sure you are familiar 
with the cardinal rule of wed-ding attire: Never look hotter than the bride. 
This rule is understand-
able, but at the same time you 
want to show guests that she 
has some hot friends, right? Well, the solution is to find a balance. 
I know it’s hard to tame 
down your trendiness, but it’s only for one night. 
Weddings are a time for 
classic colors, elegance and 
making simple statements. So 
you should probably refrain from wearing that flashy dress reserved for Rue Bar on Thurs-day nights. But don’t worry, you can still turn heads in a  light-hued dress and feminine accessories — a look that says sophistication, and is a timeless version of the word hot. You’ve got a long day and night ahead of 
you, so be sure to include comfort among things to consider while shopping. Think about the material of 
your prospective dress, and make sure it is sweat-proof and move-ment-friendly. 
Don’t forget fit. Make sure 
your ensemble leaves some room to breathe. 
The excitement of trying on an 
awesome dress may lead some to forget how many hors d’oeuvres will be devoured. 
Weddings almost always in-
clude dancing. So ditch the heels. Who said you have to don 5-inch 
stilettos to be considered dressed 
up? For summer weddings, nice sandals can make your outfit more appropriate, so you can bid those blisters and throbbing feet farewell. 
Wearing something fun will set 
your mood for the evening. Flow-ing dresses and flattering empire 
waists are perfect for letting loose 
on the dance floor. 
Corset dresses are classic and 
sexy, but if you wear one, don’t expect to spend most of your night under the disco ball. All it takes is for the DJ to ask, “how low can you go?” before you’re back at that open bar.
Last but not least, keep in mind 
whose wedding you are going to. 
If a family member is tying 
the knot, remember you will be seeing long-lost relatives you haven’t seen in ages, most of them likely removed from today’s more fashion-forward trends. Aunt Gertrude may not exactly com-
prehend the art behind studded, 
gladiator heels. 
If one of your peers is getting 
hitched, this may be the oppor-tunity to show a little flare, just don’t overdo it. 
Even if you go secretly hoping 
to meet some of the groom’s single friends, re-member ladies, it’s all about class. Wedding dress woes not just for bride
REBEKAH GEIER  � AVENUE WRITER
Contributed photo
The writer Rebekah Geier and friend Megan Goff at a friend’s wedding  in 
Melbourne, Fla., on June 5. 
Superman may be bulletproof, 
submarines may be waterproof, but 
Hollywood is recession proof.
While America is counting 
pennies and the economy is staring 
down the barrel of a loaded gun, 
movie sales are up 17.5 percent from last year, to $1.7 billion, according to Media By Numbers, a company that records box office receipts.   
This may be due in part to the 
advent of 3D movies storming theaters in the past year. Last summer’s remake of “Journey to the 
Center of the Earth,” Dreamworks’, 
“Monsters and Aliens” film and the spooky Tim Burton movie “Coraline” all made their 3D mark on the big screen.
The 3D movie market has come 
a long way since their blue and red tinged inception in the 1950s, when movie executives thought it nothing 
more than a showy gimmick.
The latest 3D Disney offering, 
“Up,” made history as the first 
animated feature to open the prestigious Cannes International Film Festival.
Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief 
executive of DreamWorks, has described the new generation of 3D as the third great revolution in the 
history of film, after sound in the 
1920s and color in the 1930s.
Some of the biggest names in film 
are getting on the 3D bandwagon. Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series and the “Beverly Hills Cop” trilogy, is producing “G-Force” a pet-shop, spy comedy featuring 
the voice of Penelope Cruz in 3D.  
James Cameron, director of 
“Titanic,” has been laboring for years over the action and animation sci-fi adventure “Avatar.” 
Famed sci-fi and adventure movie 
directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson are not to be left out. The two are directing and producing 
a 3D version of the Belgian comic 
“Tintin.”
While 3D movies become more 
common, the technology is still expensive. Gator Cinemas, located on Newberry Road in Gainesville, has four theaters but only one digital projector.
According to manager Mike 
O’Brien, digital projectors cost four times as much. 
He said the resolution is low for 
digital projectors in comparison, so it’s unrealistic to expect that theaters will make a complete switch until the issue is resolved.
“It’s OK for our 
theater because it’s smaller, but a larger room will not have good resolution with a digital 
projector,” he said.
Despite the limited technology, 
he views 3D movies as good for 
business. 
“Movies offer friendly 
entertainment for the whole family, and regardless of people’s financial situations they still want to escape and be entertained,” he said. “We’ve seen an increase in sales since they 
started making 3D movies.”
Movie theater profits from ticket 
sales are slim. At Gator Cinemas, 
they receive 10 percent of a movie’s gross in the first week, 20 percent in the second week and so on. 
Concession stand profits are the 
main income, which explains the empty wallet feeling after buying soft drinks, popcorn and candy. At a typical movie theater a night out 
for two can cost anywhere from $20 
to $40.
Emily Lake, a Santa Fe College 
student and frequent moviegoer, doesn’t think that 3-D movies are worth the extra $3.50 they add to a ticket price.
“I saw ‘Up’ in both formats, and 
I wasn’t really impressed with the 
difference,” she said. “You get used 
to the 3D images and then forget about them while you’re watching the movie.”
Regardless of audiences reac-
tions to the crop of 3D movie choices on the market, the format is here to stay. Will 3D movies revolutionize the movie industry? Will they in-crease the movie industry’s profits 
to unimaginable heights?  L i k e 
Superman saving civilization from 
an onslaught of nuclear missiles, Hollywood hardly needs the help.  
Movie makers jump into third dimension

UP NEXT IN TOP 10 UF ATHLETES ONLINE POLL QUESTION UF BASEBALL HONORSAP Photo
Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey showed up at Marcin Gortat’s home in Orlando 
just after midnight Wednesday, moments after the free-agency period began. 
� You’ll be happy to hear that we have 
recorded a brand new episode of the alliga -
torSports Podcast with Phil Kegler and host Adam Berry. Listen to us discuss UF sports as well as rant on other college-related top -
ics. Check us out on Twitter, too!Today’s question: What do you think of our picks for No. 10 and No. 9 in our list of the Top 10 UF Athletes of 2008-09?Cast your vote at alligatorSports.org.� First baseman Preston Tucker 
was named to the 2009 Baseball America Freshman All-America Team on Tuesday. He led the Gators in several stats, including batting average, RBI and HRs.THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HOUSTON — Orlando Magic cen-
ter Marcin Gortat has never been so 
popular.
Worried about the potential loss 
of All-Star center Yao Ming, Houston 
Rockets general manager Daryl Morey 
launched an all-out bid Wednesday to land Gortat, best known as the backup to Magic superstar Dwight Howard. Other teams are also interested in him.
But Morey made the hard pitch, 
showing up at Gortat’s home in Or-lando just after midnight at virtually the exact minute teams were officially 
allowed to begin negotiating with free 
agents.
Morey announced the meeting on 
his Facebook page and urged fans to leave notes for Gortat at an e-mail ad-dress — rocketsfanslovegortat(at)gmail.com. Morey said that within 10 minutes of his face-to-face meeting with Gortat, more than 100 e-mails had already ar-
rived and the number climbed above 
2,000 by noon Wednesday.
“He was reading them with some 
intensity,” Morey said. “He was im-pressed by the number of messages and how much the fans seem to care about their team. I knew Rockets fans would come through.”
Gortat’s agent, Guy Zucker, said Mo-rey even showed up in Orlando with a Rockets jersey with Gortat’s name on it. 
He also said his client was interested in 
the Rockets.
“We had planned to meet teams 
later on in the process,” Zucker said. “So this was a big surprise. The jersey with his name on it really caught him off-guard.”
Morey said the Rockets made Gortat 
an offer but would not divulge details.
“He’s someone we’ve targeted for 
some time, even before this season,” 
Morey said. “Although he’s early in his career in terms of experience, we feel like he’s a guy who has a lot of poten-
tial over time.”
All the love for Gortat is driven by 
the uncertainty surrounding Yao after the team doctor said Monday that the hairline fracture in Yao’s left foot could threaten his career. The team said last week that Yao was out indefinitely and was seeking other medical opinions to plot a new course of treatment. The 6-foot-11 Gortat averaged just 3.8 points and 4.5 rebounds a game last season 
and 3.3 points and 3.2 rebounds during 
the Magic’s playoff run to the NBA Fi-nals. He’s a restricted free agent, mean-ing the Magic can match any offer from another team to keep the player.Rockets show interest 
in free-agent Gortat
By the time you read this, you will 
have only around 12 hours to fix a terrible injustice.
Online fan voting to determine the start-
ing position players for the MLB All-Star 
Game on July 14  closes today at 11:59 p.m.
There have already been 163 million 
online votes, according to MLB.com, which is apparently a 15 percent increase to this 
point compared to a year ago.
I realize a person can vote 25 times 
(which doesn’t really make any sense to 
me, but that’s another issue), but that still means there were more than 6.5 million people signed up. Even if people sign up under multiple e-mails, we can all agree this amounts to a reasonable sample size.
That leads to my next point. wBaseball 
fans are either too stupid or too homer-ish to pick their own All-Star starters.
This is especially true when you con-sider people use All-Star starting selections as a way to compare differ-ent players or argue 
points for Hall of 
Fame selections.
Let’s take a look 
at one perfect exam-ple of a swing-and-a-miss pick current-
ly being made by fans and hurting a player from a Florida team.
You know who is the leading vote-get-
ter in the American League as of Tuesday, according to MLB.com?
Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter.Let me get this straight — I enjoy watch-
ing Jeter play. The worst off-the-field press he usually gets is for dating too many mod-MLB All-Star voting outrageousI know Gainesville is a football town. 
I know people will be tailgating on campus long before Vince Carter 
makes his debut with the Orlando Mag-ic. And I know my favorite pro sports league has trailed the NFL in popularity for a while now.
But that doesn’t matter to me. With 
the 2009 free agency season kicking off Wednesday, the NBA off-season, the most exciting of any sport, is upon us. And I couldn’t be any happier. 
I’ll admit I’m a little biased about this. 
Basketball has always been my favorite sport. I grew up around it, following my brother’s AAU teams and idolizing the likes of Michael Jordan and Penny Hard-away when I was younger, and I under-stand the complexities of the game more than any other sport.
With that in mind, the NBA off-season 
is the only one that can hold my atten-tion. From the end of the NBA Finals to the opening tip of the next season, David Stern’s league has the most consis-tently interesting downtime. 
People get re-
ally into the re-cruiting process and previewing the upcoming NCAA football season, but col-
lege football’s atmosphere is what makes it so great. With the NFL, the buildup dur-ing the seemingly endless break between the Pro Bowl and the opening kickoff is perhaps too overwhelming — and that’s just the coverage of Brett Favre. 
But something about the NBA off-
season is easier to follow and get involved in. Free agency, which started with a bang when the Detroit Pistons reportedly signed Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanue-va, becomes like solving a puzzle. Teams

Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff 
UF libero Elyse Cusack set the Gators’ all-time digs record in 
only her junior season.
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF safety Ahmad Black led the Gators with seven interceptions last season and 
helped turn around a defensive unit that was considered a weak link in 2007.
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
sports@alligator.org
Elyse Cusack came to Gainesville 
ready to become the Gators’ first 
four-year starter at the libero posi-
tion.
When she departs UF after next 
season, she will leave a legacy that 
will be tough to match by any who 
follow in her footsteps.
Oct. 31 made that case even 
stronger when she cemented her 
place in the UF record books. 
She recorded her seventh 20-dig 
performance in only the 20th match of the 2008 campaign.  
But it’s fair to say she might 
remember that one more than the 
others. 
Because on that night, she would 
pass a legend. 
On that night, she gained extra 
attention — and not just for wear-ing a different color jersey than her 
teammates, as her libero position dictates. 
Cusack recorded 22 digs to help 
UF sweep Ole Miss while surpass-ing a milestone. 
In just three seasons, she had al-
ready eclipsed the Gators’ all-time digs record and now sits with 1,634 
to her credit.
The old mark? 
A now-paltry-looking count of 
1,444 digs set by former Gator Lyra 
Vance more than 20 years ago. In fact, Cusack was born the 
very same fall in which Vance 
played her senior season for the Orange and Blue. 
And the then-junior made it to 
her record-setting number in only 81 matches.
“She expects any ball that is hit 
anywhere toward her should be dug,” coach Mary Wise said when Cusack broke the record.
Last fall also saw Cusack be-
come the first player in Southeast-
ern Conference history to earn Defensive Player of the Week hon-
ors four times in a 
single season.
But there’s 
more than just 
scraping up the 
ball off the floor and keeping points alive to the libero position. 
She also is responsible for the 
majority of UF’s first touches when 
the Gators are receiving a serve.
A bad first pass makes setting 
even more difficult and therefore 
kills become even rarer.
That’s why one might not see 
Cusack’s offensive impact, if they judge the rising senior only by the 10 career kills to her name (only by opponent’s error) and the fact that 
she has never and spiked a ball for 
the Gators.
Her importance to her team was 
recognized by the four awards she earned at the team’s annual ban-quet. 
Certainly Cusack was a shoo-
in for the defensive honors, but 
she also took home recognition in 
passing, serving and strength and conditioning.
She finished second in the SEC 
for aces per set (0.41) and was the only player in the conference to fin-ish in the top five in digs and ser-vice aces. 
It’s no surprise Cusack won the 
Gator Power Award, as her weight-room work earns mighty praise from her coaches.
Assistant strength and con-
ditioning coach for UF Olympic sports Matt Delancey told the Al-ligator last fall, “Pound for pound, she’s in the top five strongest ath-letes at the school.”
Add in an upbeat personality 
that always keeps her teammates going, and it’s easy to see the cru-cial role Cusack — one of only four 
upperclassmen on the 2008 volley-
ball team and one of only two ris-ing seniors — played this season.
For her spectacular saves and 
an all-around game crucial to the 
Gators’ success, Elyse Cusack is the 
alligatorSports No. 10 UF athlete of 2008-09.

With 10 minutes left in the BCS National 
Championship Game and his team down by 
3 but slowly marching down the field, Okla-
homa’s Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback 
Sam Bradford launched a pass down the field to receiver Juaquin Iglesias.
Iglesias reached for the ball, and even got 
his hands on it, but it was Ahmad Black who came away with the interception at UF’s 24-yard line. The safety’s team-high seventh pick of the year brought any momentum the Soon-ers might have been gaining to a halt and set 
up an 11-play, nearly seven-minute touch-
down drive that put the game out of reach.
And to think, Black was supposedly not a 
sure thing before the season started, just an-
other question mark on a defensive unit that 
allowed 25.5 points per game in 2007.
Black started all 14 games for the Gators en 
route to the team’s second national champion-ship in three years, and the improved second-
ary helped cut opponents’ offensive produc-
tion nearly in half. UF gave up just 12.9 points per game in 2008.
After playing cornerback during his true 
freshman season, Black had to fill the spot at strong safety left vacant by Tony Joiner. Dorian Munroe, who was projected to start at that po-sition, missed the entire 2008 season with an ACL injury. 
In the season opener against Hawaii, Black intercepted two passes and returned one for his first touchdown at UF. Not bad for the 
5-foot-9 then-sophomore’s first career start.
Nationally, Black finished the year tied for 
most interceptions (seven) and interceptions 
returned for touchdowns (two) as well as rank-ing second for most interception return yards 
(191). He also came in fourth on the team in 
tackles with 59 and fourth in passes broken up (five) behind fellow starters Joe Haden, Janoris Jenkins and Major Wright.
Those four — Haden, 
Jenkins, Black and Wright — started every game for UF and helped turn the 
Gators defense from a pos-
sible weak link into one of 
the surest things in college football. 
In the Capital One Bowl, 
the last game of the 2007 season, Michigan tore up the Gators’ secondary for 373 passing yards and three touchdowns. In the 2008 season, no team put up more than 300 passing yards on UF all season. The most was Georgia’s 292 on 
Nov. 1, the same game Black picked off a pass 
by Matthew Stafford and returned it 64 yards.
For turning in an exceptional season and 
playing a part in turning UF’s defense around, 
Ahmad Black is the alligatorSports No. 9 UF 
Athlete of 2008-09.

TORONTO — Ricky Romero 
spent the past two winters tinkering 
with his changeup.
All that extra work is starting to 
pay off.
Romero pitched four-hit ball over 
eight innings, Rod Barajas, Adam Lind and Scott Rolen each homered and the Toronto Blue Jays ended the Tampa Bay Rays’ seven-game winning streak with a 5-0 victory Wednesday.
“(Romero) throws a decent fast-
ball but he has an above average 
changeup,” Tampa Bay slugger Pat 
Burrell said. “He was mixing it up and locating it fairly well. We just weren’t able to make the adjust-ment.”
Barajas said Romero’s off-speed 
pitch has few equals.
“I’ve caught some good change-
ups and he’s right up there with the 
best I’ve caught,” Barajas said.
A first-round draft pick in 2005, 
Romero didn’t reach Triple-A until 
last season. Finally harnessing his changeup helped him land him a ro-tation spot with Toronto this spring.
“That was one of my pitches the 
past two off-seasons,” Romero said. “Just working on that pitch, trying to 
throw the hell out of it when I played 
catch. It’s becoming better and it’s just getting better every time.”
Romero (6-3), who took a no-hit-
ter into the seventh in his last start, matched the longest outing of his 
career in winning his third straight 
start. He walked four, struck out sev-en and lowered his ERA to 2.85. The rookie left-hander allowed just two hits through the first six innings.
“I’ll ride this little thing I’ve got 
going for as long as I can,” Romero said.
Romero is 5-1 in his past six starts 
and has not allowed a run in his past 20 innings.
“He’s good,” Rays manager Joe 
Maddon said. “He’s going to be very good for a long time if he stays healthy.”
Jason Frasor pitched the ninth to 
complete the Blue Jays’ sixth shut-out. Toronto snapped a four-game 
losing streak thanks to a trio of solo 
home runs off James Shields (6-6).
Barajas connected with one out 
in the seventh. Lind and Rolen hit consecutive shots in the eighth, the third time this season the Blue Jays have gone back-to-back.
Toronto’s defense helped Romero 
get out of a jam in the seventh, when 
the Rays loaded the bases with two 
singles and a walk. Romero escaped by getting Burrell to ground into a double play.
“That was the key to the game, the last two innings,” Romero said. “Bases loaded, one out, you’ve got a good hitter up in Burrell. I just made a good pitch that got in on him and we were able to get a double play.”
A walk and an error by shortstop 
Marco Scutaro gave the Rays run-
ners at first and second with none 
out in the eighth. Scutaro redeemed himself by catching a line drive from pinch-hitter Willy Aybar, then flip-ping to second to get Jason Bartlett for the double play. 
Romero walked B.J. Upton but 
the Rays came up empty when Carl Crawford flied out to the warning 
track in right.
“We had chances, we just didn’t get it done,” Burrell said. “We got 
close a couple of times.”
Shields allowed five runs — four 
earned — and seven hits in 7.1 in-nings. He walked one and struck out eight.
“I felt great, I thought I battled to-
day,” said a frustrated Shields, who dropped to 1-4 on the road.26, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 2, 2009

Tampa Bay pitcher James Shields puts his face in his glove as Toronto’s Scott Rolen rounds the bases 
after a home run during Blue Jays’ 5-0 win against the Rays on Wednesday in Toronto.
mAjOR lEA guE bASEbAll
Rays shut out by Jays, 
lose winning streak
els off the Maxim Top 100 List. That’s a 
problem I’d like to have.
But I’d venture to say Jeter, the only 
AL player with more than 3 million votes, shouldn’t even be starting when the two 
leagues square off at Busch Stadium. In 70 
games, the 35-year-old Yankees captain is hitting .307 with nine home runs, 32 RBI, 17 stolen bases and has a .832 OPS. 
Now, let’s take a look at the player sec-
ond among voting for AL shortstops: Jason Bartlett of the Tampa Bay Rays. In 59 games, Bartlett is hitting .362 with seven homers, 36 RBI, 17 stolen bases and .960 OPS.
Try to imagine if you didn’t know which 
stats went with what player. Bartlett’s bat-ting average is 55 points higher, and in 11 fewer games he has only two fewer hom-ers, the same number of steals and four more RBI. Oh, and an OPS more than 100 points higher. Remember that Jeter plays his games at a much more hitter-friendly park in the new Yankee Stadium compared to Bartlett’s Tropicana Field.
There really is no way to back up Jeter 
starting at short other than the fact he plays in big-market New York and the fact that he has more All-Star selections (nine) than Bartlett has years of MLB experience (six).
The 16 starters determined by fans will 
be revealed at 1 p.m. Sunday on TBS.
But today, you still have a chance to 
make things right. Don’t wait until it’s too 
late. 
Tick tock.PHIl , from page 24need to fill certain holes with their re-
maining cap space, and  unsigned players are looking for their best chance to  win a championship or get a desperate team to sign them to a ridiculous contract. (What’s up, Grant Hill? He earned $93 million over seven years with Orlando, where he played only 200 games due to injury.)
The NBA is especially exciting this 
off-season thanks to, ironically, the strug-gling economy. Teams are taking risks on players they wouldn’t have a few years ago, all for the sake of saving money or taking advantage of another team’s poor financial standing. They’re making block-buster trades and looking to improve their teams with savvy free-agent signings. 
Just look at some of the marquee play-
ers who will be wearing new jerseys next year: Vince Carter (Magic), Richard Jef-ferson (Spurs) and the Big Sidekick him-
self, Shaquille O’Neal (Cavaliers). Two of 
these teams — the Magic and the Cavs, 
who played each other in the Eastern Conference Finals this year — were will-ing to give up young talent in an effort to 
improve next year. The Spurs, who draft-
ed all of their big three — Tim Duncan, 
Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker — made a multi-player trade for Jefferson, then re-turned to their old ways by lucking into 
DeJuan Blair, a first-round talent, in the 
second round of the draft.
In a time when companies are taking 
fewer risks and playing it safe, the NBA 
has become as exciting as it has been in 
years. And with a far superior draft class 
and superstars like LeBron James, Dwy-
ane Wade and Chris Bosh becoming free agents in the summer of 2010, it’s only going to get better next year.ADAm , from page 24THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WIMBLEDON, England — This one meant 
so much to Andy Roddick.
Because of the stakes: a return to Wimble-
don’s semifinals. Because of the opponent: 
2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt. And because 
of the circumstances: a five-set grind that be-
gan under a bright sun and concluded in shad-ows, 3 hours and 50 minutes later.
When it was over, having finally figured 
out a way to get past Hewitt 6-3, 6-7 (10), 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-4, Roddick let out a sigh and raised a fist, then threw his racket down, sat in his changeover chair and covered his face with his hands.
“A mixture of happiness, of relief. In your 
mind, you’re kind of trying to stay the course for four hours, constantly figuring out what you’re going to do,” said Roddick, who swat-ted 43 aces in Wednesday’s quarterfinals at the All England Club. “Your mind is just racing.”
He hadn’t been to the final four at Wimble-
don since 2005 after losing in the second round a year ago. He hadn’t won a five-setter at any 
Grand Slam tournament in two and a half 
years. But Roddick came through in the clutch, saving three break points while trailing 2-1 in the fifth set, before earning the decisive break in a 14-point game to go ahead 5-4.
“It’s going to pay big dividends, winning 
a tight match like this,” said Roddick’s coach, Larry Stefanki. “He hasn’t done that in a long time.”
Roddick-Hewitt was the only quarterfinal 
pitting two men who have been ranked No. 1, and the only one involving two men who have won a major championship. It also was the longest.
“It certainly wasn’t short on drama,” Rod-
dick said. “It was tough from a mental stand-
point, because Lleyton wasn’t going away, and 
there were kind of a lot of ebbs and flows.”
Next up for the No. 6-seeded Roddick: a 
semifinal against No. 3 Andy Murray, who beat 2003 French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero 7-5, 6-3, 6-2. Murray is trying to be-come the first British man to win Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936, so he will be backed 
by quite a crowd in what the locals will bill as 
“Andy vs. Andy.”
“We might be able to count the people for 
me on this hand,” Roddick said, raising his right mitt. “I’m just going to pretend when they say, ‘Come on, Andy!’ that they mean me.”
The other semifinal Friday is No. 2 Roger 
Federer against No. 24 Tommy Haas. It’s a re-
match of a June 1 French Open fourth-round match in which Haas took the first two sets 
and was five points away from winning, be-fore Federer won en route to claiming his first title at Roland Garros.
That gave Federer his 14th Grand Slam 
championship, tying Pete Sampras’ career re-cord. He can surpass that mark here.
“It would be writing in the history books of 
tennis,” Federer said, then cautioned: “It’s not there yet. Still far away. Many points, many serves, many forehands.”
Seeking a sixth Wimbledon title, he beat 
No. 22 Ivo Karlovic of Croatia 6-3, 7-5, 7-6 (3). 
Haas knocked off No. 4 Novak Djokovic of 
Serbia 7-5, 7-6 (6), 4-6, 6-3.
Federer completely took the sting out of the 
intimidating serves of the 6-foot-10 Karlovic, who had won 79 of 79 service games through more than nine hours of play across his first four matches at Wimbledon — and 128 of 128 service games if you add in his previous tour-nament, too.
So wouldn’t you know it: Federer needed 
all of eight minutes and two Karlovic service games to break the big fella.
Federer hit three return winners, including 
a forehand off a 122 mph serve on break point, to take a 3-1 lead. That set the tone.
Karlovic was asked why Federer dealt with 
his serve better than other players do.
“Oh, it is only because he is better than ev-
erybody else,” Karlovic said. “That’s it.”
Federer outperformed Karlovic by winning 
74 of 85 points in his own service games. Only 
once did Karlovic so much as get to deuce on 
Federer’s serve, midway through the third set, and here is how the Swiss star responded: ser-vice winner at 129 mph, ace at 128 mph.
Take aces out of the equation — Karlovic 
led 23-7 in that category — and Federer wound up with a 32-6 advantage in other winners as he reached the semifinals at a 21st Grand Slam tournament in a row, extending his own re-
cord. No one else in tennis history ever made it 
to more than 10 consecutive major semifinals.
“It’s hard to believe I achieved it, because 
looking back, it’s not just I’m looking back on a few weeks or a month or a year or so. It’s really way back,” said Federer, who last ex-ited a tournament before this stage at the 2004 French Open. “Quite a streak.”
Consider: The other men left in the tourna-ment all have Grand Slam semifinal streaks of exactly one. Murray and Haas never had been this far at Wimbledon before, while Roddick lost to Federer in the 2003 semifinals and the 2004 and 2005 finals at the All England Club.
Roddick’s only major championship came at the 2003 U.S. Open. 
In trying to add a second, he recently 
tweaked his diet, says he’s in the best shape of his career and has tinkered with his game since hiring Stefanki for this season, working on returns, volleying and backhands.Roddick returns to Wimbledon semifinals in gutsy winTHURSDAY, JULY 2, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 27
