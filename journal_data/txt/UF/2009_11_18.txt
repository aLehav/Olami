This week, Student Government
is turning 100.
In celebration of its birthday, SG
will be on Turlington Plaza and the
Plaza of the Americas Wednesdaythrough Friday from 10 a.m. to 2
p.m., where representatives will be
sponsoring a trivia game and giving
out more than 300 prizes, said Jessica
Clements, chief of staff for Student
Body President Jordan Johnson.
The very beginnings of what is
now SG originated in the StudentHonor Court in 1909.
However, SG did not receive
funding until 1919. That's when
the first student body officers were
elected.
Prior to 1919, the university had
class officers, and in 1925 SG became

PROPOSED THE IDEA.

Students from the College of Liberal Arts and
Sciences may not have to face long lines in the ad-
vising center much longer.
The college's Academic Advising Center has
trained 25 student ambassadors to provide their
classmates with information about majors, drop-
ping or adding courses and paperwork for drop-
ping majors, said Albert Matheny, the director of
the Academic Advising Center.
Matheny said Unite Party Sen. Thomas Hilton
and former Senate President Audrey Goldman
approached him with the idea for the program
this summer.
Three advisers volunteered to help start the
program and chose 25 juniors and seniors to
serve as ambassadors.
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff Nick Mrozinske, one of the advisers, said the
Hookah Party ambassadors have been helping since Nov. 9.
Lindsey Dious, 19, and Robert Oberdan, 21, smoke hookahs at the Hookah Hutt located on West University Tuesday They set up tables outside the advising center,

Presidents reflect on political past
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Student Government celebrated its 100th birth-
day at the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom Tuesday
night with cake, a live band and about 190 guests.
The event, known as the SG General Assembly,
described SG's influence on campus and its ability
to create strong student leaders. It featured speech-
es by UF President Bernie Machen, UF Alumni
Association President Jeffery Jonasen and Student
Body President Jordan Johnson.
Machen mentioned SG's past accomplishments,
including lobbying in Tallahassee on behalf of stu-
dents, but also focused on the need for continued
cooperation between university
Student officials and SG in the future,
especially in the current eco-
nomic climate.
"The absence of a coherent Student Body voice
is chaos," Machen said.
He also mentioned political leaders UF has pro-
duced, such as Bob Graham and Marshall Criser.
Machen said students would play a role in the
decision-making process involved in the future of
the Reitz Union.
Jonasen, Student Body president from 1987 to
1988, talked about UF's campus life in the 1980s,
which included a less impressive football team and
more politically conservative students.
He offered advice to members of SG, encourag-
ing them to remember that the differences of opin-
ion they may have with fellow SG members tend to
fade away over time. Their opponents in SG may
become political allies in the future, he said.
"You make enemies in Student Government
who may become friends," Jonasen said.
The event also featured a speech from Art Sand-
een, the former vice president of student affairs. He
described SG's role in bringing all of the organiza-
tions on campus together.
Jordan Johnson capped off the evening with a
speech promoting the renovation and expansion of
the Reitz Union.
Study: Hookah use up among youth
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
Danielle Lee won't touch a ciga-
rette, but she'll pass a hookah pipe
around a circle of friends any day.
And, according to a recent UF
study, an increasing number of mid-
dle-school- and high-school-aged chil-
dren share Lee's fondness for the alter-
native form of tobacco.
The study, presented on Nov. 9 at
the American Public Health Associa-
tion's annual meeting in Philadelphia,
found that 11 percent of Florida high
school students and 4 percent of Flori-
da middle school students had smoked
hookah at least once.
Hookah burns charcoal and to-
bacco. Air is first drawn through the
tobacco and then into the pipe, where
it passes through water, which leads
many smokers to believe hookah
smoking is safer than cigarette or cigar
smoking.
Maureen Miller, alcohol and other
drug prevention specialist with UF's
GatorWell Health Promotion Services,
was quick to point out hookah's po-
tentially dangerous effects.
"This isn't harmless," Miller said of
hookah. "There certainly are some se-
rious health concerns here."
The World Health Organization
reported a typical 20- to 80-minute
hookah session is the equivalent ofsmoking about 100 cigarettes and can
deliver 11 times more carbon monox-
ide than a cigarette.
The study shows an increase in
hookah usage among members of the
same age bracket from a 2005 Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh study that found 10
percent of high school students and
2 percent of middle school students
surveyed had smoked hookah at least
once.
"Smoking hookah is far more
acceptable than smoking a
cigarette."
Danielle Lee
Gainesville resident
But the trend doesn't stop at mid-
dle and high school students. In a
two-block radius between West 10th
Street and West 12th Street on West
University Avenue, there are at least
five restaurants or lounges that offer
the alternative form and often flavored
tobacco, presumably for the college-
aged audience in proximity to UF.
"I'm totally against smoking ciga-
rettes, but I'll smoke hookah all day
long," Lee, 20, said as she blew a
plume of smoke from the watermel-
on-flavored tobacco from her hookah
pipe inside Farah's on the Avenue on a
rainy Tuesday afternoon. "It's very ac-
ceptable. Smoking hookah is far moreacceptable than smoking a cigarette."
According to Miller, Lee's view is
common.
"When people smoke cigarettes,
they feel like they have to hide it,"
Miller said. "Hookah smoking is not
the same."
Jade Shue, a manager at Farah's on
the Avenue whose favorite flavor of
hookah is lemon-mint, has also noticed
an increased trend in college-aged stu-
dents smoking hookah.
"Between [2005] and now, it has
just skyrocketed," she said.
Shue also noted the popularity with
hookah smoking might be centered
around the fact that hookah smoking
is allowed in most restaurants where
other forms of tobacco are not.
But not all people have noticed the
same trend in hookah smoking.
Lawson Brown, assistant princi-
pal of Lincoln Middle School, said
he doesn't think the students at his
school fit the profile of the 4 percent of
middle school-aged children who had
smoked hookah at least once, though
he couldn't be sure.
"Knock on wood, I feel pretty for-
tunate that [hookah smoking] is not an
aspect of our discipline or school cul-
ture," he said.
Anne Shaughnessy, assistantprinci-
pal for curriculum at Gainesville High
School, echoed Brown's comments.
"I haven't seen anything that would
cause alarm for me," she said. "I'm
not aware of any trend. I hope I'm not
wrong."Committee to
hold hearing
on travel ban
* UF PROFESSORS: YOUNG GENERATION
SUPPORTS LIFTING CUBAN TRAVEL BAN.
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
A battle is building in the United States
over whether the current ban on travel to Cuba
should be lifted, but for some in the UF commu-
nity, the answer is simple: Lift the ban.
On Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs
Committee will hold a hearing on the issue.
The committee's ranking Republican, Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen of Miami, supports the travel
ban.
Since the 2004 elections, Cuban-American
donors and political action committees that
support the embargo have donated more than
$10 million to 300 federal candidates, according
a Miami Herald report on the influence of cam-
paign contributions made by supporters of the
embargo. The report was published Monday by
Public Campaign, a nonprofit organization sup-
porting campaign reform.
Seven of the top 15 recipients were from
Florida -four Democrats and three Republi-
cans.
Rep. Kendrick Meek, who represents Miami
and is running for Senate, joined more than 40
other Democrats in signing a letter to Nancy
Pelosi supporting the travel ban and has re-
ceived more than $100,000 from pro-embargo
contributors, according to the Public Campaign
report.
But Adam Sharon, a spokesman for the con-
gressman, said Meek's policy decisions aren't
influenced by campaign contributions.
"When you are intimately aware of the life
stories of political prisoners and dissidents who
were deprived of freedom, that is what shapes
public policy decisions," he said.
But Philip Williams, director of the UF's Cen-
ter for Latin American Studies, said there is no
evidence that the embargo and travel ban have
helped bring democracy to Cuba.
Williams said President Obama made prog-
ress by lifting a travel ban against Cuban-Amer-
icans made under the Bush administration.
"It's well overdue that restrictions were lift-
ed for all Americans," he said.
Williams said Cuban-Americans who sup-
port the embargo are a vocal minority in the
community with a disproportionate influence.
Terry McCoy, director of UF's Latin Ameri-
can Business Environment Program, agreed
with Williams.
"The Cuban-American lobby has been very
affective in rounding up votes to prevent a lift-
ing of the embargo," McCoy said. "One of the
ways they do that is campaign contributions."
Both professors said younger Cuban-Amer-
icans support ending the embargo more than
older generations.
Their claims are supported by a September
poll that showed 59 percent of Cuban-Ameri-
cans believe the travel ban should be lifted. Re-
spondents 18 to 64 years of age supported lift-
ing the ban by 62 percent, while only 49 percent
of those 65 and older supported lifting the ban.
Jessie Ribot, a Cuban-American student at
UF, said she thinks the travel ban should be
repealed. Ribot, a UF freshman, moved from
Cuba to America when she was 7.
She said she doesn't think America can influ-
ence Cuba's government, but Americans should
have the right to visit the island.Ana Goni-Lessan / Alligator Staff

Apartment
holds clothes
drive to help
abuse shelter
By ASHLEY HORN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Turkey, stuffing, blue jeans.
Spyglass Apartments is asking its resi-
dents to add another item to the list of take-
home holiday leftovers.
"My idea is that students will go home
for Thanksgiving and bring tons of stuff
back," said Lauren Hughes, leasing agent
at Spyglass Apartments and director of the
complex's clothing drive for Peaceful Paths,
a shelter in Gainesville for abused women
and their children.
Hughes encourages UF and Santa Fe
College students to clean out their closets
for Thanksgiving and bring the clothes to
the apartment's leasing office.
Items in need include clothing, shoes,
books and stuffed animals. Peaceful Paths
asks especially for women's professional at-
tire for those who are starting new lives and
searching for jobs.
Peaceful Paths will sell the donated
items from Spyglass tenants in its thrift
store, which is open to the general public.
All proceeds go to the Peaceful Paths Do-
mestic Abuse Network Inc.,
LOCacl including its shelters, support
News groups and hotlines.
"Many women and their
children who come here have no clothes,
except for the ones they are wearing," said
Lori Eddy, receptionist and coordinator of
the "Adopt a Family" program at Peace-
ful Paths. "We give them vouchers to go
shopping at the thrift store. The amount the
voucher is worth depends on the needs pre-
sented."
Eddy said the donation drive at Spyglass
comes at a perfect time of year. The busy
holiday season spurs higher traffic at the
shelter, increasing financial need. "I hope
this becomes a competition between apart-
ment complexes in Gainesville," Hughes
said. "It's for such a good cause."
Hughes said she has no expectations for
donations but hopes everyone will get in-
volved.
In 2007, college students in the U.S. spent
an estimated $5 billion on clothes and shoes,
according to stateuniversity.com.
"People living comfortably often fail to
realize that there are many less fortunate in-
dividuals out there," said Kristen Wietzke,
a resident at Spyglass. "I am going to set
aside one weekend to dig through my closet
for things I don't wear or use anymore, or
that I think someone less fortunate would
make better use of."
Peaceful Paths especially needs gift cards
for groceries, gasoline and phone cards.
"I think this is a very good way to start
off the holiday season," said Wietzke.

brighten their day?"WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 5

The next weekend, Covey returned to her hometown,
Bradenton, and spoke with a local school's guidance coun-
selor, who told Covey that such a program would fill a
serious need at the school.
The next day, Covey applied for nonprofit status and
began work on Backpack Club Inc.
Her program gave disadvantaged students a full back-
pack on the first Friday of every month and would con-
tinue to fill the students' backpacks as long as the students
ZT returned the bags.
Covey fills the backpacks with donated dented Pub-
lix products and uses money donated by her church. The
Mark Wandall Foundation also gave the organization a
$1,000 grant.
The backpacks are filled with items like pasta, honey,
Pop-Tarts, applesauce, Chewy Bars, raisins, toothbrushes,
L shampoo and books.
Toiletries are the most requested items, Covey said, and
each backpack costs about $100 to fill for the school year.
The Backpack Club has given backpacks to 100 students
at Freedom Elementary School in Bradenton, and hopes to
match that number at Littlewood by the end of the school
year. So far, 12 students have entered the program.
Sherri Brunner, guidance counselor for Freedom El-
ementary School, said the students who receive backpacks
IUM are monitored for attendance and achievement improve-
ments in their classroom.
"Times are tough, and we all need to work together to
create a brighter future," Brunner said. "The program has
brought the community closer."
The most rewarding aspect for Covey is the faces on the
children when they receive the backpacks.

UF students plan projects for peace
By LINDSAY FERGUSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Kathryn Wasserman Davis made a
birthday wish for peace on Earth.
For her 100th birthday, Wasserman
Davis decided to commit $1 million to
fund 100 different projects for peace.
Tracy Reeves, the coordinator of
the selection process for UF students,
hosted an informational session Mon-
day night for Davis Projects for Peace
and will host another session Wednes-
day at 6 p.m. in Room 202 of Peabody
Hall.
Projects for Peace are grassroots
projects that can be implemented any-
where in the world, according to the
organization's Web site. The project is
up to the students, but the foundation
encourages creativity and a world-
wide scope.
Past projects from UF students in-
clude planting trees in Swaziland and
providing more protein to citizens'
diets and a potable water system in
Uganda.
All undergraduates who attendDavis United World College Scholars
Program partner schools are eligible
to design a project.
The Davis foundation chose UF
student Ali Zuaiter's project on Pales-
tine last year.
"You can achieve peace in so
many different ways."

Originally from Jordan, the eco-
nomics senior focused his project
on giving microloans to Palestinian
women.
Over the summer, Zuaiter and two
other UF students worked to select
deserving students from schools in
Palestine to receive the loans. The first
loans were just dispersed a few weeks
ago, he said.
Students have two pages to explain
the background of their idea, the proj-
ect they hope to implement and a de-

You know this how?
Mammogram guidelines
follow international standardConservative horror stories about Obamacare run amok
are finally coming true in the minds of some.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a govern-
ment panel of doctors and scientists, concluded on Monday that
women in their 40s do not need mammograms. According to
the Associated Press, the decision went on to state that women
should begin biennial testing at age 50. This is a break from the
American Cancer Society's long-held position, which states that
women should seek annual mammograms beginning at age 40,
and it has stirred controversy in the medical community.
So this sounds like an open-and-shut case of Obama-style
communist health care rationing, right? While we're sure that
some people (you know who) will paint it as such, let's not
jump to conclusions. Early breast cancer diagnosis is critical,but
if the health risks and financial costs of testing women under 50
outweigh the benefits, this is a sound decision.
The task force found that early and frequent screenings of-
ten lead to false alarms and unneeded biopsies, without signifi-
cantly improving women's odds of survival. It argues that the
risk of breast cancer in women younger than 50 is very low, but
the risk of biopsy complications after false-positive results is too
high to recommend mammograms for this group.
These recommendations are also in line with international
guidelines, which call for testing to begin at age 50. The World
Health Organization suggests mammograms every two years,
while Britain says every three years.
So before jumping on the pundit bandwagon, already begin-
ning to portray this as the Obama administration trying to take
away health care from those who need it, consider the argu-
ment in its entirety.
Cu-Ban
s week, Congress is
taking up the issue of
the Cuba travelban, part
of an embargo started against
the communist country in
1960. For nearly 50 years, it
has been effectively illegal for
Americans to travel to Cuba.
Americans can still travel
to countries with human
rights records that make Cuba
look like the pinnacle of free-
dom, and countries with mili-
tary ambitions that make the
former Cold War adversary
look like Switzerland.
In fact, it's currently legal
for Americans to travel any-
where else in the world. So
why, you ask, is this little Ca-
ribbean island still off-limits?
Money. We were not sur-
prised when a new report
found that campaign contri-
butions are more influential
than party affiliation in de-
termining which members of
Congress choose to maintain
the Cuban embargo.
Since the 2004 elections,
Cuban-American donorsand political action commit-
tees supporting the embargo
have donated more than $10
million to 300 candidates for
federal office, seven hailing
from Florida. Legislators are
also swayed by industry, as
the Florida sugar lobby fights
(and pays well) to keep Cuban
sugar off U.S. shelves.
Two senior congressmen
argued in a Miami Herald op-
ed Tuesday that the travel ban
only strengthens the Castro
regime. By isolating Cuban
citizens from their democratic
neighbors to the north, and
keeping U.S. dollars out of the
country, the embargo restricts
the ability of Cuban citizens to
push for change.
We are encouraged by
President Obama's decision to
lift travel restrictions for Cu-
ban-Americans. But now, it's
time for Congress to act and
bring an end to the half-centu-
ry of limited freedom of travel
for U.S. citizens and counter-
productive half-measures to
fight the Castro regime.

Privacy should be given greater value
S everal weeks ago, I showed up to my friend Katie'shouse to watch TV.
"Sorry I'm late," I said. "I was at a wine bistro with
my friend."
"Ooh, your friend?" she said. "That sounds exciting."
"Yeah, my nonexistent secret boyfriend," I said.
Katie smirked.
"You could have a secret boyfriend if you told three
people," she said.
I didn't used to care about privacy, and in some ways,
I still don't. It's probably true that I couldn't keep a secret
boyfriend a secret to save my life, and if I have a good story
to tell, all of my friends have heard it at least once.
But somewhere along the way, I realized that the more
personal information I exposed to the world, the more vul-
nerable I was to getting hurt. It's not that I'm dishonest or
super secretive now, but I have learned that privacy isn't an
abstract concept.
When people know everything about you, they hurt you.
It doesn't mean they're villains; it just means they're hu-
man. Telling people your secrets is like giving away parts of
yourself, and if all your social network "friends" or every-
one on your text Listserv knows every detail of your private
life, they own you. I don't think our generation places much
value on privacy. We've been raised on reality shows that
value voyeurism, and social networking sites encourage
spilling your guts to everyone on your friends list.
When those "25 Things" lists were infecting Facebook,
I learned more personal information than I ever cared to
about people I barely knew. I don't need to know that your
current girlfriend is the one you think you're going to spend
your life with. That's going to be awkward when you break
up in a month.
Cell phones might enable privacy when you're a teen-
ager with younger siblings who listen in on landlines,Hilary Lehman
letters@a lIigator orgbut I've overheard enough cringe-
worthy conversations on the bus to
know that cell phones have prob-
ably exposed more information than
they've protected. I don't want to
hear your conversation about your
weekend hookup or your phone call
to your bank where you list your so-
cial security number, birthplace and
mother's maiden name -yes, this
really happened once.
I'm even protective of my music. If I have friends in my
car and my iPod is playing, I'll only let my close friends
change the playlist. Giving people access to your music -I
used to have a playlist titled "depressing songs" -is like
giving them the key to your underwear drawer: highly per-
sonal and highly embarrassing.
We read our gossip blogs, watch "The Hills" or stalk our
newsfeeds, and we don't think anything of it. But I feel like
I'm selling my soul with the need to know everything about
other people -because suddenly, other people also want
to know everything about me.
I don't trust mankind enough to be able to cry on the
phone in the middle of the hallways of my college or to
express deeply personal feelings on my blog, Twitter or
Facebook. Privacy should be linked to trust. I tell my clos-
est friends everything, but that group is about 10 people.
Beyond that, I'm not going to reveal parts of myself in ways
that leave me exposed.
It's unfortunate, but I don't believe the standards of pri-
vacy should change because technology and society allow
us to expose so much more. People can't read your mind for
a reason. You shouldn't enable them to.

Grad students can't afford new fee
As a graduate student, the dream of being
financially solvent seems a distant one. Most
grad students live below the poverty line. Yet,
once again, UF is attempting to raise student
fees -this time to pay for the renovation and
expansion of Reitz Union. And these fees will
affect graduate students differently; we actual-
ly have to pay for our fees (unlike undergrads
who receive Bright Futures and/or prepaid).
Now, I'm not one to complain about fees. I
get paid to do research and teach, and this is a
pretty sweet gig. I'm not a member of Gradu-
ate Assistants United. Hell, I've even argued
for the necessity of fees. But, we already had a
$100 increase this year (and likely an addition-
al 5 percent next year). I know many academic
departments have been "trimmed" to meet the
budget crisis, but perhaps the university could
find a better way to pay for these costs. Do we
really need a renovated Reitz Union -espe-
cially given said budget crisis? If the answer
is yes, well, so be it. But could we at least get a
proposed grad student bar out of the deal?

'War on terror' not a war
This is in response to Tuesday's guest col-
urmn, "Trials give terrorists better treatment
than they deserve." While most of WarrenRhea's opinion was intelligently argued, the
final paragraph certainly gave me pause.
Speaking about the Bush administration's war
on terror, he wrote, "It's a war, let's start treat-
ing it like one." I disagree with this.
Under the Obama administration, the use
of the phrase "war on terror" has come to an
end. Calling the global effort to eliminate ter-
rorists a war only legitimizes terrorists actions.
It allows groups like al-Qaida to justify attacks
on Americans because they are, by our own
definition, combatants in a war. If we are not
fighting a war on terror, however, we remove
terrorists' ability to claim that their actions
are justified parts of war and force them to
recognize their targets not as soldiers, but as
people.

In the past, speakers like Dr. Jack Kevorki-

to campus and provided enlightening and
provocative commentaries that enriched the
minds of attendees. Can we save our money
for this sort of speaker instead of no-show
HBO stars? If students really want television
celebrities then so be it, but do we need to
spend more than $80,000 on a speaker? Maybe
I should have majored in theater (like Piven).

Students show selfishness by scalping
I am disappointed in Gators fans. With the
SEC Championship tickets selling out in less
than an hour last night, it was disappointing
to students who missed out. However, what
is most disappointing is learning that the rea-
son tickets sold out so quickly is because many
people logged in to purchase tickets only to
sell them for a few hundred bucks. What is
wrong with you? I mean, you cannot even get
the tickets from the box office without a driv-
er's license and UF ID.
So, are you going to drive to Atlanta with
the person purchasing your ticket or give them
your license and UF ID? Seriously, the selfish-
ness of people today continues to amaze me.

SG has faced recurring
issues during the years
100TH, from page 1
SG has embraced 100 years
of involvement as a road to
change, pressing for reform
on the national, state and local
level.
It has brought up a student
accident and health plan, pe-
titioned to the government to
lower the voting age to 18, pro-
tested the Vietnam War and
lobbied for the right to continue
to manage the SG budget.
There have been many is-
sues throughout its 100 years,
but some recurring problems
remain on the agenda.
"It's interesting, really," said
Brian Burgoon, who served as
Student Body president from
1996 to 1997. "I'll pick up an
Alligator today, and it's very
likely that I'll read about someof the same issues we dealt
with when I served."
SG has combated issues
ranging from expanding the
Reitz Union to allocating more
on-campus parking.
"It was
Student really im-Government portant to
us to pre-
serve student authority for fu-
ture students to come so that
they could have the same expe-
riences," Burgoon said.
Johnson said he's excited to
be a part of SG's 100th birth-
day.
"It is a time for us to reflect
on all the things Student Gov-
ernment has done and the role
it has played in the history of
our university," he said. "It's
special and we understand that
we're tasked with contributing
to that legacy."CLAS has 25 students who answer questions
CLAS, from page 1
"I've seen students coming in
better prepared," Mrozinske said.
Ambassador Nina Martinez,
a political science and English ju-
nior, said the ambassadors serve as
a link between students and their
faculty and advisers. Martinez said
her time in Student Government
helped her realize that this linkneeds to be repaired.
"You realize how inaccessible
some of the institutions at UF are,
and you just
UF want to aid inAcademics any capacity to
make the school
a little smaller," Martinez said.
KeithMorgan, a psychologyand
criminology junior, also worked at
the table. He said he helped answerUF freshman Sabrina Jackson's
question about the requirements
for a chemistry class and referred
her to an adviser. Jackson said she
anticipated a long wait at the advis-
ing office and plans to get help from
the ambassadors in the future.
"I think it's a good thing to do
for the students who are in a rush
and don't have time to wait for an
adviser," Jackson said.
Graduate students oppose expansion fee
SENATE from page 1
student unions.
Emily McCann, an English Ph.D student, said grad-
uate students would unfairly bear the burden.
Unlike undergraduates, they do not have Bright Fu-
tures funds to help cover their student fees, she said.
Progress Party Sen. Vikram Munikoti, who repre-
sents graduate students, said he supports a bigger and
better Reitz Union but not at the expense of students.
Former Orange and Blue Party Sen. Ben Cavataro,
said he also disagreed with the resolution, adding there
were not enough facts available about the cost.
He said all students should have the chance to vote
on the fee during the spring elections.
Orange and Blue Party senators Alan Yanuck and
Jonathan Ossip introduced an amendment that sup-ported a student vote on the fee during the spring 2010
SG elections. However, the amendment failed.
But Senate President Ashton Charles, an author of
the resolution, said not voting on the
fee could delay necessary renova-
tions to the union.
"It needs to happen now,"
Charles said. "We have to take the
action now for it to be a success."
She said the resolution is meant
to start conversations with the ad-
ministration, who would have the
power to implement the fee. She de-
scribed an amendment to the resolution that recogniz-
es the high fees graduate students face and allows for a
diminished fee or no fee for the graduate students. The
graduate student amendment passed unanimously.

0 POOR SHOOTING NIGHT
DOOMS GATORS.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alI gator org
The Florida women's basket-
ball team made 50 percent of its
shots in a season-opening win
over Stetson, but coach Amanda
Butler thought it could do even
better.
It didn't quite turn out that
way.
UF couldn't overcome a
27-percent (9 of 33) second-half
shooting effort and fell 66-62 to
No. 15 Florida State (2-0) in the
O'Connell Center on Tuesday.
Florida (1-1) finished the night
20 of 61 from the floor (32.8 per-
cent), including a 29-percent
showing from behind the 3-point
line (9 of 31).
"It's not like we played well,"
Butler said. "The shooting night,
when we look back on it, was not
typical of our team. We know that
this was a bad shooting night for
us.

Florida-FIU? Alabama-

If I'm a college football fan,
there's obviously nothing I'd rather
do than plop on the couch to catch
these thrillers (and shell out extra
for the opportunity if I'm a Gators
fan).
Twenty teams ranked in the AP
poll play this week. None face a
ranked foe.
The culprit? Well part of it is the
April 2005 decision by the NCAA
to permanently allow Football
Bowl Subdivision teams a 12th
regular-season contest.*
(The American Football Coach-
es Association was in favor of stay-
ing at 11 games* at the time. Not
like college football coaches would
know anything about the game.)
Four years later, the result is
crappy games and bigger athletic
department budgets.
It's all about the money, baby.
Big-time programs like Florida
got a chance to host a seventh game
and reap all the financial rewards.
Further confirming that it's all
about the dollars and cents is the
fact that a year later, the NCAA de-
cided not to put the same rule in ef-
fect for Division I-AA teams. They
still play 11 regular-season games*
(yes, I realize they have a playoff).These teams
wouldn't get
much of a fi-
nancial boost
because they
already have
Ph il Keglermuch lower

pkegler@aligator org figures.
* Note: Di-
vision I-A and
I-AA teams have always been allowed
12 games in years where the schedule
happens to have 14 Saturdays (like
2002, 2003, 2008 and 2013). Three
byes would be rather absurd. There-
fore, the rule passed was referring to
allowing schools to play 12 games in
13-week years, which are much more
common.
Fans get to see their team beat
up on a lowly opponent.
After Saturday, Florida will
have hosted one game each of the
last four years between the end
of SEC play and the FSU game -
two against Sun Belt Conference
opponents (Florida Atlantic 2007,
FIU 2009) and two against Football
Championship Subdivision op-
ponents (Western Carolina 2006,
The Citadel 2008). UF already has
a similarly scheduled game next
year -Applachian State, a FCS
team.

UF MEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators look to avoid becoming latest upset victim
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Madness in college basketball
isn't exclusive to March.
Several teams in the Southeastern
Conference, commonly perceived
to be much improved coming off a
down year, have already fallen to
or narrowly escaped upset-minded
underdogs early in their nonconfer-
ence schedules this season.
"It's amazing to me that in the
month of March, games like that
that are upsets in the NCAA Tour-
nament get much more magnitudeplaced on them," UF coach Billy
Donovan said. "If people were pay-
ing attention in the month of No-
vember, they'd see it happen all the
time."
With UF (1-0) taking on Georgia
Southern (1-1) tonight at 7 in the
O'Connell Center, the Gators aren't
taking anything for granted.
"It just makes you more on-edge
because you don't want to be one
of those schools that loses and gets
knocked off," point guard Erving
Walker said. "They may be small
schools, but these schools still got
talent. If you don't bring your A-
game, they'll beat you."If people were paying at-
tention in the month of
November, they'd see [up-
sets] happen all the time."
Billy Donovan
UF men's basketball coach
Mississippi State, Alabama and
Georgia got a taste of the giant kill-
ers' potential, as they dropped their
season openers to Rider, Cornell and
Wofford, respectively.
It hasn't just been SEC teams
bothered by the upset bug. UCLA's
68-65 loss to Cal State Fullerton indouble-overtime ended a 37-game
home winning streak against un-
ranked nonconference opponents.
Even Kentucky -ranked No. 4
in the nation and picked to win the
SEC this season -needed a last-sec-
ond shot from heralded freshman
John Wall on Monday night to hold
off Miami (Ohio) in the Wildcats'
second game of the season.
The RedHawks kept it close due
in large part to their 15-of-26 shoot-
ing from 3-point range. Donovan has
stressed the importance of defend-
ing the outside shot to his players, as
he considers it the equalizing factor
between powerhouse programs andoutmatched opponents.
"Games can get away from you
a lot easier if you're scoring twos
and the other team's scoring threes,"
Walker said. "That means they're
winning."
Despite the possibility of a huge
upset making national headlines,
Walker said he doesn't enter the
games against weaker nonconfer-
ence teams with a different attitude.
"You're just out there playing
like it's any other school when it's a
small school," Walker said. "It's just
more news if the game is close or if
you actually do get upset by them."

WHOOPS, from page 14
Despite its shooting woes, UF managed to keep it close the
entire night. Florida State needed an Alexa Deluzio jumper with
37 seconds left to take the lead for good. The Seminoles strug-
gled from the free-throw line, finishing 11 of 20 (55 percent).
"That's why we were in position to win the ball game at the
end -because of our effort and fight," Butler said. "We've just
got to get better at closing out ball games. We had our oppor-
tunities."
Senior Sharielle Smith scored a team-high 18 points and tal-
lied 13 rebounds, tying career highs in both. The forward strug-
gled at times from the field, finishing 4 of 11, but nailed four
three-pointers and was 6 of 9 from the free-throw line.
Transfer Jordan Jones scored 13 points, dished out five as-
sists and grabbed three steals in her second game in a UF uni-
form. Azania Stewart added 8 points in 25 minutes on 3-of-4
shooting.The Gators opened the game on an 11-4 run against a Semi-
noles' defense that allowed 10 first-half points against UNF on
Friday. Through the first five minutes, the Gators used defense
to generate offense but struggled after two Smith free throws at
the 15:09 mark.
Smith nailed a three-pointer with 3:03 remaining in the first
half and then added a free throw and another
shot from beyond the arc with 1:07 remain-
ing in the first half to give the Gators a 35-32
F lead heading into halftime.
Women's The second half followed suit, going
Basketball back-and-forth with three lead changes. The
Gators went into a drought for more than
three minutes, ending with a three-pointer
by Smith with 4:24 left.
"It was a tremendous challenge and certainly (FSU was)
ready, but I think that we showed that we can play with any-
one," Butler said. "We showed that is indeed the level we
should be competing at."
Florida won last two matchups by combined 10 points
HOOPS, from page 14
With the possibility of an
upset having become a reality
for other SEC teams, the cliche
of taking one game at a time
might actually be useful ad-
vice for the Gators.
The last two years, Georgia
Southern has played Florida
close, giving UF even more
reason to focus on tonight's
matchup in practice.
In 2007, the Gators took a
narrow 52-49 win in Jackson-
ville, and last year, they need-
ed Nick Calathes to take over
and score 10 of the team's final
19 points to escape with an 88-
81 victory.
"There is a lot of parity.
There are a lot of good coach-
es, a lot of good programs, a
lot of good teams," Donovan
said. "With that, you're going
to have those kinds of situa-
tions. Hopefully we'll get our
guys ready and prepared to go
Wednesday."Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff

PHIL, from page 14
a tougher opponent at this point of the year?
There is no advantage, especially in the BCS
system. Every year, the Gators' SEC record will
have either set them up for a possible national
title or have knocked them out of the race. A
nonconference loss in November would always
wreck national championship hopes, something
absolutely absurd if UT managed to make it
through SEC play at 8-0 or 7-1. No need to buff
up the schedule.
No matter how much Meyer wants to talk
coach-speak about how great Fll is, the truth is
it's a break between conference play and the an-
nual rivalry matchup with Florida State.
In fact, you might say Meyer has found just
the recipe for his scheduling. Florida starts the
season with two cupcakes before opening SEC
play against Tennessee. The Gators then play
their eight conference games in a nine-week span,
with a bye thrown in there during the middle.
(Although as much as it seems like the bye is
always perfectly timed, part of this is coincidence,
based on the league's scheduling. It has sure paid
off, however. In '06, it fell after the Auburn loss.
In '07 and 08, it came right at the halfway point.
This year, it gave Tim Tebow a chance to recover
from a concussion. Like I said, it's coincidental.)
Then UF gets one more confidence-boosting
blowout the week before the Florida State game.
It used to not happen this way. From 1992 to
2001, a 10-year span, the Gators faced the Semi-
noles the week after UF's last SEC game in every
seasonbut one. So Meyer gets a week to fix things
while still getting his guys some game reps and
avoiding rust. Florida gets another home game
to help its athletics budget
What's the problem? The casual football fan
loses. The sport becomes a little more diluted. Se-
nior Day loses some punch.
Didn't see that last one coming? In 2006 and
2008 (and it'll likely continue in every even year),
the Gators seniors played their last game in The
Swamp against embarrassingly inferior competi-
tion.
I realize the door has been opened, and there
is no going back. I just wish adding more pitiful
football games wouldn't have been so irresistible
to the NCAA.

FlU program slowly improving under Cristobal
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
Most of Florida's wins this season have been
too close for comfort as far as fans are con-
cerned, but online betting sites expect FIU to
provide the cure this weekend.
As of Tuesday afternoon, most oddsmakers
had the No. 1 Gators (10-0) pegged as 45-point
favorites, but UF coach Urban Meyer and recent
history would advise against taking that bet.
Meyer had high praise for the Golden Pan-
thers (3-7) at his press conference Monday.
"There is no question Fil will be a bowl team
sooner than you think," Meyer said. "There are
quality athletes, and they are very well-coached.
.This is not a smaller Division I team. This is
a very good team that will be in a bowl game
within two years. That's our opinion, because
they have very good personnel and they throw
it around."
Reaching a bowl in the next two years would
mark an incredible achievement by FIU coach
Mario Cristobal. The Golden Panthers are in
just their eighth season with a football team and
their fifth in Division I-A, and when Cristobal
took over in 2007, the team was coming off an
0-12 campaign.
Things didn't get much better in his first
year, as FIU went 1-11, but with five wins last
season, there is reason for optimism.
When Cristobal -who played at Miami in
the early 1990s -enters The Swamp on Satur-
day, he'll be taking mental notes on how to keep
the turnaround headed in the right direction.
"[Florida is] the type of program you want
to be like," Cristobal said on the Sun Belt Con-
ference teleconference this week. "They've been
around for a long, long time, and their roster is
full of phenomenal athletes. They do a great jobin every phase of the game. They run the ball ex-
tremely well, they're physical up front, they're
not only a fast and athletic team, they're a team
that will put a hurtin' on you."
Facing the Gators won't be the first big chal-
lenge for the Golden Panthers. They opened
the season at Alabama, where they took a 14-13
lead in the second quarter and trailed by just six
at halftime.
The Crimson Tide went on to win 40-14, but
the game proved FilU wasn't willing to play the
cupcake role.
Last week, the Golden Panthers topped
North Texas 35-28, using a diverse offense that
Florida will have to prepare for.
With quarterback Paul McCall coming off an
elbow injury, backup Wayne
Younger was subbed in for
a change of pace on a few
drives, and FIU also ran the
Wildcat offense with running
back Kendall Berry.
Berry, Darriet Perry and
Daunte Owens -a high-
Cristobal school teammate of UF quar-
terback Tim Tebow -form a three-back rota-
tion, and dynamic receiver T.Y. Hilton will also
have to be watched closely.
Hilton was a Freshman All-American punt
returner last season, and although Cristobal
is confident in his selection of playmakers, he
knows it'll be a steep uphill climb to move the
ball against UF's defense.
"When they get to the football, they get there
in numbers and they get there with an attitude,"
Cristobal said. "They force the ball out. They
create turnovers, they're very secure with the
football as well. Their special teams have obvi-
ously caused a lot of issues with a lot of teams
because of not only their athleticism, but they're
well-coached."

Nov. 18, 2006: No. 3 Florida 62, Western Carolina 0
QUICK SCOOP
The Gators scored on nine of their first 10 possessions as they dominated
the Catamounts of the Football Championship Subdivision on Senior Day.
Freshman backup quarterback Tim Tebow threw for two touchdowns and
ran for a pair of scores while Riley Cooper became the first Florida freshman
to have three touchdown catches since Jabar Gaffney in 2000. That duo
proved to be pretty good. Mon Williams, who transferred to Eastern Illinois in
February 2009, led the team in rushing with 95 yards on nine carries.
Nov. 17, 2007: No. 14 Florida 59, Florida Atlantic 20
The Owls of the Sun Belt Conference managed 20 points in the second
quarter but were held scoreless the other 45 minutes on the same day
the Gators were eliminated from the SEC East race when Georgia
defeated Kentucky.
Tebow threw for three scores and added one on the ground as he
become the first player in FBS history to have 20 passing touchdowns
and 20 rushing touchdowns in the same season. Andre Caldwell led
UF with 164 receiving yards on 13 catches as he broke Carlos Alvarez's
school record for career receptions. Backup quarterback Cameron
Newton, who transferred to JUCO program Blinn in January 2009, rushed
for a team-high 46 yards on six carries.
Nov. 22, 2008: No. 3 Florida 70, The Citadel 19
QUICK SCOOP
The Gators tallied 706 yards of offense, third-most in school history, as
they routed the Bulldogs, a member of the FCS.
Meyer paid a Senior Day tribute to redshirt senior defensive tackle Javier
Estopinan by letting him run the ball in from I yard out, his first and only
career touchdown. Tebow needed just I I attempts to throw for 201 yards
and three touchdowns. Chris Rainey led Florida with 142 yards on seven
carries -but remains a Gator, breaking the mold of Williams and Newton.
