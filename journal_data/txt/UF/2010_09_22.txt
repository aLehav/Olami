BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — The lawyer for a Colorado man 
who was arrested for addressing the Boulder City Council in his 
boxer shorts said the city has agreed to pay $10,000 to settle his civil rights claim. Attorney David Lane said Seth Brigham ac-cepted the deal Tuesday. In exchange for the payment, Brigham agreed not to file a lawsuit.
Brigham was handcuffed and arrested in February on suspi-
cion of obstructing police and trespassing after he spoke to the council clad in his underwear. Brigham said he was trying to make a point about a proposal to criminalize nudity.
The charges were later dropped.

University Police have a suspect in their investigation of 
a reported sexual battery case at a fraternity house over the 
weekend.
According to the UPD crime log, a sexual battery was re-
ported around 2 a.m. Sunday morning in the Tau Epsilon Phi 
Fraternity house located at Nine Fraternity Row.
UPD spokesman Capt. Jeff Holcomb said the victim is an 
18-year-old woman. She is not a UF student.
According to Lt. Scott Summers, who 
works in the Criminal Investigations Division at UPD, the suspect is a male UF student. 
He said the investigation is still open and ongoing.“We’re trying to talk to people who might be possible wit-
nesses,” he said.
No arrests had been made as of Tuesday evening. Tau Epsilon Phi Fraternity received a one-year suspen-
sion from its national organization in November 2008 after 36 pledges were found kneeling shirtless on the basement floor.
Paige Crandall, then-interim Dean of Students, and UPD 
officers had entered the fraternity house receiving a call about 
possible hazing. 
The fraternity house reopened in January.Rape reported

When UF President Bernie Machen got 
the opportunity to explain UF’s use of fed-
eral stimulus money at the White House, he 
talked about staying healthy in old age.
The validity of federal stimulus dollars 
funding university research projects fueled 
the discussion at a roundtable meeting held by Vice President Joe Biden at the White House on Tuesday, and Machen was one of seven education officials in attendance.
He touted the six-year study by the uni-
versity’s Institute on Aging on whether a physical activity regiment can prevent or delay physical disability in the elderly. The study is being partially funded with $29.5 million of stimulus funds — money Ma-chen says is worth spending when consid-ering the potential impact the results can have on lowering health care costs.
The study was one of several presented 
before Biden, who Machen said expressed support for university research.
“University research is the best invest-
ment we can make,” Machen said.
He said the attention the federal govern-
ment is giving the issue provides a good 
basis for making a case to the state for more 
funding in the next legislative session.Machen, Biden discuss

Timothy Taylor, a UF professor of Food 
and Resource Economics, was fired Fri-
day for making sexually inappropriate 
and derogatory comments while teaching.  
Several of Taylor’s students contacted Lisa 
House, another professor at The College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, in April and said that during case studies on sexu-al harassment, professor Taylor allegedly “indicated that in some cultures women liked to show their sexuality, dress promis-cuously , and wear very revealing clothes,” 
according to an Investigation Findings re-
port.
Students also alleged that Taylor “looks 
female students up and down” and once asked a girl to dance to her cell phone ring-tone after her phone rang during class. 
Taylor has worked at UF since 1980, 
and witnesses in the report stated that he allegedly said in class that he is a full 
tenured professor, and he can do whatever he wants. 
Although Taylor 
admitted that he made a comment similar to the harassment accusa-
tion, he denied allega-tions that he looked 
“female students up 
and down.” 
Taylor had previously been suspended 
twice for inappropriate behavior and com-
ments to female students. Prof fired for commentsCampus

After premiering to standing ovations in Ber -
lin, Wynton Marsalis’ Swing Symphony will 
make its American debut Wednesday on WUFT, 
performed by the New York Philharmonic Or -
chestra.
Though the work showcased was composed 
by Marsalis, the work of a UF professor brought 
the symphony from simple piano sketches to 
large-scale orchestra arrangements.
James Oliverio, who heads the Digital World 
Institute at UF, worked as a collaborator on the 
project, serving as Marsalis’ orchestral consul-
tant.
Oliverio said his job was essentially to serve 
as Marsalis’ translator from the original jazzy piano sketches to the full orchestra. 
“It was a meeting of those two kinds of musi-
cal aesthetics,” Oliverio said. “I served as an in-terpreter for Wynton into the world of European classical music.”
According to Oliverio’s program notes, the 
concert itself is a five-movement, hour-and 45-minute musical journey through the different eras of swing – the ragtime era, the genre-defin-ing roaring ‘20s swing era, the Kansas City swing 
era and the bebop era. 
His job was not easy, Oliverio said. Marsalis 
gave him the daunting task of completing the work in five weeks. 
In order to complete the piece, Oliverio worked 
tirelessly, often spending nights and weekends in his studio, forgoing sleep in the name of putting 
the notes onto paper. 
“It was definitely not a trivial undertaking,” 
he said. 
“If it had taken six months, it would’ve been 
quite an achievement.” 
Though the work was difficult for him, he 
credited his already-established relationship with Marsalis as something that helped him get 
it done. 
Oliverio had previously worked with Marsa-
lis at the turn of the century on the composer’s 
first symphony, titled “All Rise.” The piece was commissioned for the beginning of the new mil-lennium. 
During the creation of that symphony, Oliver -
io  practically lived in Marsalis’ New York apart-ment working on the piece, he said. 
“We were familiar with each other’s working 
styles,” he said. 
“We developed a rapport, and that made it 
possible to pull this off in such a short period of time.”
Oliverio also said that opportunity was some-
thing he felt he couldn’t pass up. 
“The opportunity to work with Wynton again 
and the Berlin Philharmonic, who many people think is the finest orchestra in the world, is not something that comes along every day.”Music professor’s symphony collaboration to debut

National Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network 
(RAINN) Day is Thursday, and organizations at UF want to raise awareness about sexual assault on campus.
The events will be held on the Reitz Union Colonnade 
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to inform and educate students 
about sexual assault and rape. 
This event will provide resources for victims and peo-
ple who are interested in learning more about how to re-
duce their risk of being sexually assaulted. 
Students will have the opportunity to play beer pong 
without the beer. They can also win candy while learning statistics about rape and sex-ual assault. 
Representatives from the organizations 
will be walking around with umbrellas decorated with facts about how to prevent sexual assault and rape. 
Laura Kalt, victim advocate counselor and community 
education project coordinator for the Alachua County Victim Services and Rape Crisis Center, said communica-
tion between partners or any two people is important and 
wants to educate students as to why.   
RAINN Day is the first of many upcoming events at 
UF for the organizations to inform students about sexual 
violence. Event seeks to help 
students avoid rape

TAMPA, Fla. — After Jamaican reggae star Buju 
Banton had a conversation about drugs with a gov-
ernment informant he met on a plane, it triggered a series of meetings and phone calls about buying and selling cocaine, according to testimony from 
the informant and recordings played Tuesday in 
Banton’s federal drug trial.
Banton and the informant, Alexander Johnson, 
met on a plane from Spain to Miami at the end of Banton’s European tour last summer.
Johnson testified that they began talking about 
drugs early in the flight.
“He told me he was involved in the transporta-
tion of drugs from Venezuela to St. Martin,” John-
son said. “His involvement was he moved money 
himself for traffickers out of England.”
They exchanged phone numbers and agreed to 
meet the next day in Fort Lauderdale.
Recordings of that July 27, 2009, meeting and 
other phone calls and conversations from July 2009 through December were played in court Tuesday.
“Do you have any contacts where I can get co-
caine?” Banton asked Johnson in one recorded con-versation.
He told Johnson he wanted to give him money 
so he could buy and sell the drugs — but the singer did not want to be more involved.
“All I do is finance,” Banton said.The four-time Grammy nominee is on trial in 
Tampa federal court on charges of conspiring to distribute cocaine and carrying a firearm during the course of a drug trafficking crime and aiding and abetting two co-defendants in possessing a firearm during the course of cocaine distribution.
Banton and Johnson discussed a variety of en-
terprises over several meetings in restaurants, such 
as selling drugs in Europe, having Banton finance 
a drug deal, buying drugs from Colombia and the Caribbean island of St. Martin, using Johnson’s boat to transport drugs, and giving Johnson a cut of a drug deal.
Banton’s attorney, David Markus, says those 
conversations turned to drugs only after the men were drunk.
“You talked about (Banton) do-
ing a lot of things that he did not do,” Markus said while cross-ex-amining Johnson.
The men also made small talk 
while driving to an undercover po-lice warehouse in Sarasota on Dec. 
8, according to another recording.
Johnson admonished the singer 
for smoking. Banton replied, “I 
smoke herbs, man. A lot of ganja.”
Banton also complained, according to the record-
ing, about a gay rights group that had protested over violent, homophobic lyrics from early in his music career. Shows in several U.S. cities last year were canceled because of the protests.
“They’re pushing me, man,” he told Johnson. 
“These guys are trying to run me under.”
Johnson also testified that Banton introduced 
him to Ian Thomas, a co-defendant.US informant testifies drug case

Two bill presentations were cut short and a 
total of four bills were struck down during the 
Student Senate meeting Tuesday night.
Bill discussion was cut short for legisla-
tion concerning parking privileges for Student Government officials and eliminating the use of “I voted” stickers during SG elections.
All four bills were sponsored by members 
of the Student Alliance party . 
“The reason the Unite Party voted to call 
the question was because the tenor of the de-bate was becoming absurd,” said Unite Party spokesman Micah Lewis. “There was cursing, sexual references; it was demeaning to the rep-utation of this Senate to allow it to continue.”
He added that he had not seen a Senate 
meeting get so heated in a long time. 
Sen. Alan Yanuck, who represents the 
Student Alliance party , said the Unite Party disappointed their constituents by cutting the debates short in favor of early votes.
“Instead of listening on behalf of 40,000 
students, they turned a deaf ear on behalf of 40,000 students,” Yanuck said.
Kevin Kleponis, Student Alliance party 
Senator, said the bill presenters had become frustrated after their speaking time was cut off.
The other bills that failed to pass con-
cerned the creation of a committee of sena-tors to review the Student Body President’s nominations for SG agency positions.  
The committee, made up of senators from each party , would interview the nominees before the Senate voted to approve them. 
Kleponis, who authored the bill, said it was 
meant to create a committee to mimic a similar body in the U.S. Senate.
The bill failed failed by majority vote.  “The reason the Unite Party was against this was because it was a duplication of procedure that’s already in place,” Lewis said. “Basically everything this committee woul do is already done by either the Senate as a body or the Re-placement and Agenda Committee.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2010

Students interested in 
playing an intramural sport 
at UF no longer have to sit through congested captain meetings.
This fall, Rec Sports is in-
troducing a new online cap-tains meeting to its Intramu-ral Sports Program. All of the large team sports that require a team captain now have the option to go to the in-person captain meeting or try the 
new online version. 
The new online captain 
meeting has already been ac-
cessed by more than 700 stu-dents, said Aaron Hobson, the Intramural Sports Coordina-tor. The online addition was created to be more conducive to a student’s schedule, Hob-
son said.  
The new online portion 
has taken more than two and 
a half months of production and can be accessed through Sakai, the new learning sys-tem.
Students who chose to use 
the online captain meeting are 
required to watch a two-part 
video about the general poli-cies of intramural sports and take a quiz on these rules. The captain quiz is good for one academic year, so students don’t need to take it again in 
the spring.
“We’re not trying to trick 
them by any means,” Hobson 
said. “We want to make sure they are educated so they know exactly what they’re prepared for.” 
All captains, regardless 
of whether 
they are go-
ing to the 
in-person or online cap-tain meet-ing, are now required to take an on-line rules 
quiz for their sport. 
Hobson said the  online 
version has alleviated some of the overcrowded captain meetings by more than 100 students per meeting. 
“We’re making some pret-
ty good changes, and a lot of those changes are directly be-cause the students [are] voic-
ing what they would like, and 
we want to give them what they want,” Hobson said.Intramural captain

Instead of taking out loans, some students will 
be giving them beginning this semester. 
The MicroFinance Foundation will lend to im-
poverished entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe who want 
to start their own businesses.
Finance major Bastian Böckenhüser started the 
group with four other students after a friend started a similar organization at another Florida school. 
He said his friend’s group lent $200 to a tailor in 
Uganda to buy a new machine. The group gave him one year to pay back the loan.
After two months, Boeckenhueser said the tailor paid back the loan and gave an extra $50.
Boeckenhueser said the MicroFinance Founda-
tion will give out small loans, between $200 and $500, with very low interest rates to people who would normally be denied loans because of their lack of income or credit.
“At least we’re giving them the opportunity to 
try,” he said.
The group chose Zimbabwe 
because it is one of the top ten poorest countries. Citizens can 
apply for the “microloans” with the group’s liaison in Zimbabwe, who will send the applications to the group. The group will review the applications and choose recipients during weekly meetings. 
The group’s first meeting will be held Wednes-
day at 6:15 p.m. in Stuzin Hall, room 104.Loans to help African businesses

The Florida Cabinet debates 
scheduled for Oct. 5 at UF were 
canceled Tuesday afternoon.
The debates were to take place 
between the attorney general, chief financial officer and commissioner of agriculture candidates. 
“We were looking forward to a 
good, serious debate for the cabi-net positions and we believed they would have been very informative for the voters,” said Dean Ridings, 
president and CEO Florida Press 
Association.
“Unfortunately , without full 
participation, there is no debate,” he said. 
Both Pam Bondi, Republican candidate for the attorney general, and Jeff Atwater, Republican can-didate for the chief financial offi-cer, did not confirm scheduling for the debates, Ridings said.
Sandi Copes, Bondi’s press 
secretary , wrote in an e-mail that Bondi was excited to receive many debate invitations, but she only agreed to a debate hosted by Bay News 9 and Central Florida News 13 on Oct. 16, and a second by Uni-vision.
The Atwater campaign was not 
available for comment. 
Bondi’s Democratic opponent, 
State Sen. Dan Gelber, had agreed to the debate.  
Gail Sasnett, the interim assis-
tant director for public programs for the Bob Graham Center, which would have hosted the debate, said in a phone interview that the Center is disappointed the debate fell though. 
Sasnett said both candidates 
for agriculture commissioner, Democrat Scott Maddox and Re-publican Adam Putnam, were still confirmed, but that “the cost to do it would be too great for one de-bate.”Campus Cabinet debate canceled

The UF College Democrats partnered with Ben and Jer -
ry’s on Tuesday to campaign for UF students to support 
the Youth Promise Act, which stands for Prison Reduction through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support 
and Education.
The group passed out free ice cream while talking to 
students on the Plaza of the Americas.
The Youth Promise Act focuses on implementing ways 
to reduce the prison population. The legislation would focus on using evidence-based practices, such as mentor -
ing and counseling services, to prevent teen violence and 
criminal street gang activity.
The act will also involve committees that will analyze 
certain high-risk communities to try to solve the problems that cause such activity.
As students enjoyed the free ice cream, both groups ral-
lied for them to call for their state senators to support the law. 
“We hope to get it passed before Congress’ session ends 
in November,” said Dan Kahn, the event coordinator. 
 Supporters hope this act will spread peace throughout 
America and that people will act to end violent behavior.
“It’s challenging for people to risk intervening,” said 
Jeffrey Weisberg, a member of the Peace Alliance board of 
directors. “A lot of people just let it go.”
Many believe that the act will help the government 
save money. According to a World Health Organization 
report, the U.S. spends over $65 billion dollars annually on maintaining the prison system. The adviser for College Democrats believes that the act is “a good idea that’s long overdue.”
“It has to be looked at as an investment,” said Leslie 
Thiele, a professor at UF. “The long term pay off is the re-duction in the prisons; the short term costs is implement-ing these programs.”
Erin Murphy, College Democrats vice president of com-
munity affairs, said that the act relates to students because it deals with underprivileged youth.

� SHE DRAGGED HIM OVER A MILE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CINCINNATI — An exotic dancer was indicted 
Tuesday on murder and other charges in the death 
of a man authorities say she dragged over a mile under her SUV .
Kristina Hensley, 35, of Higginsport was in-
dicted in Butler County Common Pleas Court in Hamilton on two different murder counts and one count each of aggravated robbery and failure to stop after an accident in the death of Jae Cho, 31, of Monroe. Monroe is about 25 miles north of Cincinnati.
Cho was trapped under Hensley’s vehicle Aug. 
7 and dragged until Hensley came to a stop at a gas station, a state-
ment released by Butler County 
Prosecutor Robin Piper said.
“It is an event that never should have happened, 
and Ms. Hensley is responsible for the death of Jae 
Cho,” Piper said.
Court records didn’t list an attorney for her. 
If convicted of murder, she could get up to life in prison, Piper said. 
Police said that Hensley was hired for a private 
show at Cho’s home and that she told officers he kept touching her inappropriately and jumped in front of her sport utility vehicle when she tried to 
drive away.
A police officer reported that Hensley told of-
ficers she felt something and heard something un-
derneath her vehicle, but was unaware that Cho had become stuck under her SUV as she drove to the gas station for help, the Hamilton JournalNews reported.Exotic dancer

There is a menace slowly creeping across UF’s cam-pus.
No, I’m not talking about the proposed flat-rate 
tuition plan that has gained traction among university ad-ministrators throughout the state, nor am I talking about steadily increasing enrollment or the influence of those Dove World members. I’m talking about Humans vs. Zombies.
That’s right, a seemingly harmless game. I’m an 
18-year-old college student and not a crotchety old man, so why do I want my fellow Gators to get off my lawn? 
Simple. It’s an issue of image.
I completely feel Humans vs. Zombies is covered un-
der a student’s right to free speech and assembly and 
shouldn’t be banned or restricted, but the founders, or -
ganizers and participants should seriously think about a 
perception shift.
Why does it matter? It’s worth noting above all else 
that UF is a four-year research institution, focused on 
educating its students to their fullest potentials, be it an undergraduate, graduate or professional degree. Just like any other school, it needs to replenish its graduating se-niors with incoming freshmen. 
Prospective students and their parents are taking last-
minute tours and deciding on whether or not to apply to the university are seeing The Swamp, The Hub and some crazy group of guys with bandanas and NERF guns.
I’m not trying to be a stickler, and I’d be off my rocker if 
I said all I did was go to class, study and sleep.
But if I am enjoying myself at the university, I’m not 
running around with fake weapons and clothing accesso -
ries as if I were an extra in a George Romero film.
Since I was accepted at the university, I have been in-
volved in two incidents with Humans vs. Zombies. I don’t have a vendetta, I promise. The first one was more passive. I was with a friend for spring’s Orange and Blue debut to check out some of our players for the fall football team and Dance Marathon. In between the trek from our car to the game, I spotted a student who looked near -
ly depraved with a bandana reading 
“ZOMBIE.” This guy was way too into this.
The second incident occurred this past week. It was 
actually an act of concern on behalf of some Humans vs. 
Zombies players right after I had donated blood for the 
first time and was visiting a friend in her dorm. 
The horde of zombies walked by me screaming “Not 
human. Blood donator. Keep going!” 
OK, guys, thanks a lot, but I’m actually a human  with 
flesh and bones, and, by the way, you’re taking this too seriously. 
Don’t you all have somewhere to be on this lovely Fri-
day evening?
So how do we fix it? Common sense solves a lot of 
things. Remember you’re representing the university and don’t be a buffoon. It might also serve the organizers well to determine a better time frame for the game. An all-out late Friday night 12-hour consecutive game would be much more logical and, frankly, a bit more difficult to the participants with less time to complete objectives and a much quicker pace.
After the Corry Village incident and another arrest for 
the football team, a zombie attack is the last thing potential students and parents want to hear about.
Sean Quinn is a first-year political science student. His 
column appears every Wednesday. Red herring 
Just more than a week 
ago, we wrote with op-timism that our country 
was moving forward, end-ing a 17-year-old discrimina -
tory ban that forcefully puts a gag order on gay members of the military. 
Just more than a week 
ago, we sighed with relief when a judge ruled uncon-stitutional the law that pro-hibits gay members of the military from asking or tell-
ing anyone anything about 
their sexuality.
Just more than a week 
ago, we thought things were over.
And then Republicans 
proved us wrong. 
Tuesday afternoon, the 
U.S. Senate failed to muster 
the 60 necessary votes to in-
voke a regulatory procedure called cloture that would have effectively ended de-bate and moved the bill di-rectly to a vote.With every Republican 
senator in opposition, the 
move to fight for equality 
in this country failed once again at the red hands of the Right. 
And although we agree 
it would be preposterous to support eliminating debate on a $726 billion defense bill, which includes the provision 
to end “don’t ask, don’t tell,” 
we also realize the defense bill probably wouldn’t have been so hotly contested or filibustered if that tiny pro-vision wasn’t included.
And we’re ashamed. We’re ashamed to live in a 
country where the dominant 
political parties fight to be 
so ideologically unique that even a message of equality for those who choose to fight so bravely for a war even they might not agree with can’t bring the warring states of red and blue together.Mutant mutiny 
FDA may give go-ahead 
to genetic modification
Hidden inside a fair-trade, raw, organic, vegan health-
foods store wearing clothing made from nothing but hemp, Michael Pollan is crying.
“The Omnivore’s Dilemma” author is sure to be in a tizzy 
about the latest national front-page headlines spreading the whines from those educated Americans who pay more atten-tion to what’s on their plate than what’s on TV .
Food and Drug Administration officials are weighing its 
options of approving a first-of-its-kind request to market a genetically modified version of salmon that grows twice as fast as its biologically sound counterpart. 
The mutant model, sure to be the bee’s knees for those 
trendy pescetarians, is being called the “Frankenfish” by those environmental radicals who lament such tawdry and 
radical concerns of ecological destruction, decimation of the 
natural salmon population and a proliferation of artificial food finding its way to our plates. 
Don’t these hippie, tree-hugging, sing-along-time envi-
ronmentalists know we’re just starting to put a bandage on our still-oozing recession wound? 
If we can get cheaper marine-dwelling, mutant pisces fak-
er than a Swedish Fish on our dinner plates, let’s do it.
Who cares about the possibility of these “Frankenfish” in-
ducing extinction for the real deal? When we can make our own fish, who cares about authenticity or nature? 
Besides, we Americans already fill our shopping carts with 
genetically modified (completely fake) crops all the time, and no one gets feisty about that.
What’s a little more fake-fish politics going to hurt?

Letters to the Editor
Unfair to discredit indepen-
dent candidates
This is in response to yester -
day’s letter by Justin Willems, 
which de-legitimized the inde-
pendent Student Government 
candidates.
The fact the Student Alliance 
campaign was disqualified for 
a paperwork technicality is not 
a secret. Ironically, Justin’s let-ter about conspiracy came out the very same day The Alligator published a story explaining the 
Student Alliance’s mistake and 
why it would not be running can-didates this election. 
After finding out about the 
party’s disqualification many other candidates and I, formerly slated with the Student Alliance, 
decided to run on our own as 
independents. We met up later to brainstorm ideas for our indi-
vidual campaigns, choosing to 
call ourselves The Independent Coalition. 
I know I speak for all the in-
dependents when I say we have 
worked very hard on our cam-
paigns without the finances or labor of a party machine. 
We don’t appreciate being 
collateral damage to individuals who have personal issues with leaders of a party we aren’t even members of.
Those of us who chose to run 
independent want to distance ourselves from these kinds of partisan distractions to better represent the interests of the Stu-dent Body.

Independent Coalition not fit 
to represent Student Body
The actions of Mr. Sautin and 
Mr. Gundavda are truly comi-cal. Monday’s Alligator chose to 
speak of the 24 “independent” candidates running in the up-
coming SG elections. 
Let me shed light on what ac-
tually occurred. You messed up, 
Student Alliance. It’s plain and 
simple. Your reasons to be “in-
dependents” are directly linked to your failure to file necessary paperwork. There was no scheme or political agenda. 
These “independents” are the 
mere product of past Orange and Blue/Student Alliance senators who have no choice but to be 
non-affiliated.
 I applaud your attempt at a 
cover up, but did you honestly 
think it would go unnoticed?  
I actually feel sorry for the can-
didates who intended to run as Student Alliance senators and are now being forced to run with this so-called “Independent Coalition 
of Students” for a mistake made 
by the leaders of the Student Al-liance Party.  
As a student of this university, 
here is my big question: what 
faith can I have that you are able 
to represent the Student Body?  How can you file a motion when you cannot file your party?

Independent candidates lying 
to Student Body
As I scanned the pages of 
The Alligator on Monday, I was 
stunned by what I read in the 
article regarding the indepen-
dent candidates running in this semester’s election. Does the Stu-dent Alliance truly believe the students are so incredibly dumb? 
Sure, I know elections can get 
dirty, but to pose as independents in order to escape the negative image of your party? Really? 
In case you haven’t noticed, 
students like me don’t like being lied to. 
All we ask is for hard work and 
honest leadership — two things you have failed to display.

Former senator disappointed 
in campaign tactics thus far
During my daily ritual of read-
ing the Alligator, I came across 
something that sincerely disap-
pointed me. At first glance, the 
number of candidates opting to run as independents this semes-ter surprised me. 
As a former senator, this 
seemed unusual.
 However, upon further read-
ing, I soon realized this could not be farther from the truth. It 
is my understanding the Student 
Alliance is misrepresenting its involvement with the upcoming election. 
Additionally, the notion of an 
Independent Coalition of Stu-dents sounds very similar to an organized party. 
During the course of my in-
volvement I have always been guided by the principle that stu-dent leaders have the obligation to be forthright with the students they seek to represent. 
We are bound by duty to serve 
our constituents with honesty and integrity.
While this principle seems 
to be lacking within certain ele-ments of the campaign thus far, it is my sincere hope for the dura-
tion of the current campaign sea-
son that more noble inclinations prevail.

What reality show is Snooki from? Which celebrity 
shaved her head during a breakdown? What scan-dal was Tiger Woods involved in this past summer?
Chances are most people 15-25 could answer those ques-
tions without pause. But ask them who John Boehner is, or what is the power-sharing arrangement the Obama adminis-tration is encouraging for Iraq, and the response will likely be, 
“Uhhh…”
Young people are increasingly uninformed when it comes 
to politics and the influential people in government who affect 
us. Instead, we focus our attention on “entertainment news,” and mistake it for actual news.
Part of the reason for this is that large news networks, like 
CNN, often have extensive coverage of entertainment news   — the Tiger Woods scandal, the deaths of celebrities like Michael Jackson and Anna Nicole Smith and the incarcerations of Lind-
say Lohan and Paris Hilton. Many of us trust networks like 
CNN for quality, relevant news, but that is not what is always presented.
This is not to say that it’s wrong to get our fill of entertain-
ment news or watch reality TV (even I’m curious if Snooki and 
Sammi are friends again).
Entertainment news is like junk food, as professor Marcel 
Dufresne said in my Journalism Ethics class. Junk food has its 
place, but your entire diet shouldn’t consist of it. It’s important 
to balance it with healthy food. In other words, if we are going 
to watch reality TV and keep up with our favorite stars, we need to make sure to balance that with actual news.
We have a responsibility to educate 
ourselves, to seek out information and 
to be aware of the issues that impact 
us. This means picking up a newspaper 
when we see it outside of the dining hall. It means watching the news during non-primetime hours, or perhaps even better, 
a publicly funded station (e.g. local channels 10 and 11) on a 
regular or semi-regular basis.
Why is this so crucial? As voting citizens, it is our right and 
responsibility to make sure that those leading us are doing so fairly and openly , and that issues are being handled the best 
way. If we aren’t keeping an eye on what is happening locally, 
nationally and globally, then what is the point of living in a de-mocracy? The freedom of the press has become underappreci-ated, we need to take advantage of it more.
Also, while the phrase “we are the future” is cliché, it is true. 
It is our generation that will influence the next few decades. Our economy is in a dangerous state, the country has been involved in two major wars and there is heated debate over global climate change. We need to be informed of these and 
other matters in order to ensure that we are properly prepared 
to deal with them when they fall into our laps.
In addition to simply paying attention to the news, it is im-
portant to look at all sides of an issue. How can you expect to 
speak intelligently about current events and politics if the only 
information you are getting is one-sided? Being well-rounded allows for informed opinions and make educated decisions.
So, in the spirit of being up-to-date, I will answer the ques-
tions posed earlier.
John Boehner is the House Republican leader and, accord-
ing to The New York Times, said he would agree to lower taxes for families earning less than $250,000, but then quickly took back the statement.
The power-sharing arrangement for Iraq, again according to 
The New York Times, is one in which the current Prime Minis-ter would keep his position but with less authority.
Pay attention to these stories, these are the ones that really 
matter When reading the news, you attain a greater knowledge 
of what’s happening and also gain the tools needed to be an 
effective, contributing citizen.

GREAT FALLS, Mont. — A 
Montana resident believed to be 
the world’s oldest man celebrated his 114th birthday Tuesday at a re-tirement home in Great Falls.
Walter Breuning was born on 
Sept. 21, 1896, in Melrose, Minn., and moved to Montana in 1918, where he worked as a clerk for the Great Northern Railway for 50 years.
His wife, Agnes, a railroad tele-
graph operator from Butte, died in 1957. The couple had no children.
Breuning inherited the dis-
tinction of being the world’s old-est man in July 2009 when Briton Henry Allingham died at age 113. Allingham had joked that the secret to long life was “Cigarettes, whis-ky and wild, wild women — and a good sense of humor,” according to Guinness World Records.
The Guinness organization and 
the Gerontology Research Group each have verified Breuning as the world’s oldest man and the fourth-oldest person. Three women were born earlier in the same year as Breuning.
Robert Young, senior consul-
tant for gerontology for Guinness World Records, presented Breun-ing with a copy of the book’s 2011 edition that lists him as the record holder.
“Walter wasn’t in last year’s 
edition,” Young joked. “He was too young.”
The Great Falls Tribune report-
ed that Breuning gave a speech before about 100 people at an invitation-only birthday party at the Rainbow Retirement Commu -
nity, with a guest list that included Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer and representatives from Guinness World Records.
Breuning was helped up to a 
lectern from his motorized cart, ap-pearing somewhat frail but speak-ing with a strong voice.
He recalled “the dark ages,” 
when his family moved to South Dakota in 1901 and lived for 11 years without electricity, water or plumbing.
“Carry the water in. Heat it on 
the stove. That’s what you took your bath with. Wake up in the dark. Go to bed in the dark. That’s not very pleasant,” he said.
He said men and women may 
be able to enjoy life, but they can’t be content without a belief or faith. His parting message to the crowd was one of tolerance.
“With all the hatred in this 
world, in this good world, let us be kind to one another,” Breuning said.
Breuning has celebrity status at 
the retirement home, with visitors waiting in line to see him, Ray Mil-versted, 92, told the Tribune.
Tina Bundtrock, executive direc-
tor of the Rainbow, said the home has adopted a policy of scheduling visits with Breuning by appoint-ment, so he’s not taxed by people dropping in to see him.
Before his birthday party, Bre-
uning declined to name a favorite among the 114 years he has seen.
“Every year is the same,” Bre-
uning told the Great Falls newspa-per.
But he criticized one modern in-
vention — the computer.
“When the computer came out, 
that was one of the worst things,” Breuning said. “They laid off all the clerks on the railroad.”
But, he added, “Every change is 
good.”8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2010

NATIONALWorld’s oldest man celebrates more than 11 decades� DEMOCRATS FAILED TO OVERCOME THE 
‘DON’T ASK, DON’T TELL’ FILLIBUSTER.
By ERIN RAUCH 
Alligator Contributing Writer
Legislation to end “don’t ask, don’t tell” failed in 
the Senate on Tuesday . 
Democrats needed 60 votes to overcome a filibus-
ter, but Arkansas Democratic Sens. Blanche Lincoln 
and Mark Pryor joined all the Republicans in filibus-tering. The final vote was 56 in favor, 43 against. 
The annual defense bill authorizes monetary ap-
propriations for military activities of the Department of Defense and also included the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” and the DREAM Act.
Florida’s Senators were divided on the vote, Re-
publican Sen. George S. LeMieux voted against it and 
Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson voted in favor.
Ricky Carter, vice president of Pride Student 
Union at UF, said the filibuster is not only stalling fis-
cal appropriations, it is blocking the amendment to repeal “don’t ask, don’t tell.”
Carter added that he doesn’t think the focus of 
the filibuster should only be on the stalled “don’t ask, don’t tell” repeal. The DREAM Act, which is also included in the legislation, would allow illegal 
immigrants who came to the United States as chil-
dren to be eligible for a 6-year-long conditional path to citizenship if they completed a college degree or two years of service in the military.
 “I think this is basically painting a light for Re-
publicans that they are anti-gay and that they’re anti-military essentially,” Carter said.
The “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy was made law in 
1993 during former President Bill Clinton’s first term. 
Under the law, the military’s ability to ask service 
members about their sexual orientation is limited. 
Homosexuals are allowed to serve if they don’t talk about their sexual orientation, and if they refrain from homosexual acts.
“It’s been a hot button issue for quite some time,” 
Carter said.
The House approved a proposal to repeal “don’t 
ask, don’t tell” on May 27. The vote was 234 to 194, with 229 Democrats and 5 Republicans in favor.
“I think it’s a very problematic policy ,” A.C. 
Stokes, director of LGBT affairs at UF, said. “I think 
it’s in the country’s best interest to repeal.”
Seventy-five percent of Americans said they sup-
port openly gay people serving in the military, ac-
cording to a Washington Post-ABC News poll con-ducted by phone Feb. 4-8.
Kristin Klein, president of the UF College Demo-
crats, said it is likely that repealing “don’t ask, don’t tell” won’t come up for a vote again until next year.
“I certainly hope this bill will pass in the future, 
but it is completely contingent upon the November 
mid-term elections,” Klein said. “We, as Democrats, must maintain a Con-gressional majority and if we could even pick up a few seats to make it a 60-40, that would be ideal.”
She said chances of getting the “don’t ask, don’t 
tell” policy repealed would be higher if Democrats maintained the majority.
Ross Hodish, a former Santa Fe student and a 
lance corporal currently stationed at Marine Corps Base Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii, said that while it’s un-fortunate that gay and lesbian soldiers can’t be open about their sexuality, it is necessary.
“It would directly weaken our military,” he said. 
“And at this time, in our country , we can’t afford to have a weak military.”
Hodish said he has not encountered any problems 
due to the enforced “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.
“I agree with the policy,” he said. “And I’m very 
happy it was successfully filibusterd.”Locals react to bill’s defeat
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ATLANTA — Two men have 
filed a lawsuit accusing Bishop Eddie Long of exploiting his role as pastor of an Atlanta-ar -
ea megachurch to coerce them 
into sexual relationships when 
they were young members of his congregation.
Lawyers for the men, now 
20 and 21, say they filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in DeKalb County Court. The Associated Press generally does not iden-tify people who say they were 
victims of sexual impropriety.
Craig Gillen, Long’s attor -
ney, said Tuesday the pastor 
“categorically denies the alle-gations.”
“We find it unfortunate that 
these two young men would take this course of action,” Gil-len said, adding that Long had 
not yet been served with copies 
of the lawsuits.
The men were 17- and 18-year-old members of Long’s New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, when they say Long abused his spiritual 
authority to seduce them with 
with cars, money, clothes, jew-elry, international trips and ac-cess to celebrities.
B.J. Bern-
stein, an at-torney rep-resenting the plaintiffs, said 
that when 
the relation-
ships started, the plaintiffs were past the 
legal age of consent in Georgia, which is 15.
“Defendant Long has uti-
lized his spiritual authority 
to coerce certain young male 
members ... into engaging in sexual acts and relationships for his own personal sexual grafitication,” the lawsuits read.Lawsuit claims

Long scoring drives have been in short supply this sea-
son for No. 9 Florida, but you won’t hear Carl Johnson com-
plain.
“I really don’t think we should ever start at our own 10, 
that’s what special teams are for. I’m fat, I don’t want no 90-yard drives,” UF’s 355-pound left guard said. “I love 40-yard drives. We have to rely on special teams. That’s special teams’ job, to put the offense in good situations.”
True, the Gators have set the table nicely for quarterback 
John Brantley through three games, with average starting field positions of the 49-, 33- and 41-yard lines, but the lack of lengthy possessions is still troubling for UF.
Florida has just three scoring drives of 65 yards or longer 
compared to 10 at this point last season, and two of those this season came via Jeff Demps touchdown runs of 72 and 62 yards.
UF ranks 11th in the Southeastern Confer -
ence in total offense (317 yards per game), but it’s still fourth in the conference in scor -
ing (34.3 points per game) despite those struggles.
Field position and defense have had a lot to do with that 
scoring total.
Against Tennessee, the Gators started as many of their 
13 drives in Vols territory as they did from inside their own 35-yard line: three.
“Our field position in that game is why we won [in Knox-
ville],” coach Urban Meyer said. “That whole thing about 41 percent of our team being freshmen, most of them don’t 
understand that. The value of being a left tackle on kickoff 
return is just as valuable as carrying the ball. It takes a lot to beat that into them.”
The message appears to be taking hold, and Demps de-
serves much of the credit.
The junior is sixth in the nation for kickoff returns, bring-
ing the ball back an average of more than 36 yards per try. 
But UF is averaging just 7.57 yards per punt return, and 
Demps’ dual role as starting running back could jeopardize his consistency in the return game as the season wears on.
Meyer is a self-professed lover of special teams, but he 
knows his offense can’t get too reliant on the unit to carry it.
“Offensively, we just have to improve,” he said. “[Brant-ley], the receivers, the offensive line all [need to improve], and there is a lot of urgency, which I have been saying. We need to start seeing results. We are, but I’m a little bit more down on the offense right now. But they are getting bet-ter.”WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 13

PHILADELPHIA — Michael 
Vick’s impressive play earned him 
a starting job. 
Vick will take over as the Phila-
delphia Eagles’ No. 1 quarterback, coach Andy Reid said Tuesday, a day after he announced he would go back to Kevin Kolb.
“When someone is playing at 
the level Michael Vick is playing, you have to give him an opportu-nity,” Reid said. “This isn’t about Kevin Kolb’s play. You’re talking about Michael Vick as one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL right 
now.”
Kolb missed the last six quarters 
because of a concussion, and Vick 
played well in his absence. Kolb was cleared to practice and was ex-pected to run the first-team offense on Wednesday.
“Kevin is fine. It’s not an injury-
related issue,” Reid said. “It’s not 
about judging him. He’s going to 
be a championship-caliber quarter -
back.”
Vick threw for 175 yards and one 
touchdown and ran for 103 yards in a 27-20 season-opening loss to Green Bay. He had 284 yards pass-ing and two TDs in a 35-32 win at 
Detroit on Sunday.
Kolb started two games in his first three seasons before he be-
came the team’s No. 1 quarterback after Donovan McNabb was traded to Washington. Kolb struggled in 
the first half against the Packers in 
the season opener.
Though the Eagles have been 
grooming Kolb to be the starter since drafting him in the second round in 2007, Vick forced Reid to make a difficult decision by play-ing better than he did when he was a superstar in Atlanta.
“Michael did an exceptional job 
and my job is to evaluate the play-ers,” Reid said. “It’s my obligation 
to make the proper decision.”
Vick’s start against the Lions 
was his first in nearly four years. 
A three-time Pro Bowl pick in six seasons with the Falcons, Vick missed two seasons while serving an 18-month sentence in federal prison for his role in a dogfighting 
operation. 
He signed a two-year contract with the Eagles before last season, 
then played sparingly behind Mc-Nabb and Kolb.
Vick has completed 63.8 percent 
of his passes and has posted con-secutive games with a passer rating 
above 100 for only the second time 
in his career.
“His accelerated play was bril-
liant,” Reid said. “This is what I 
think is right. He’s back and maybe even a little better.”
The knock on Vick used to be 
that he was a run-first quarterback 
who quickly moved through his 
reads and took off running prema-turely.
He clearly benefited from watch-
ing McNabb operate the offense last season, and has excellent teachers in Reid and Eagles offensive coor -
dinator Marty Mornhinweg. 
Vick proved against the Lions 
that he can be an effective pocket 
passer. Despite getting sacked six 
times and being under constant pressure, he scrambled enough to buy time and find open receivers downfield.
Given Philadelphia’s struggles 
on the offensive line, Vick’s speed and quickness is vital. 
Kolb has a quick release and can 
escape pressure, but Vick is per -
haps one of the most elusive quar -
terbacks in league history.Eagles name Vick starting QBFootball

Through the first nine matches of the sea-
son, Murphy has 25 total blocks and is on 
pace to improve from last year’s total of 63.
“Give Kelly credit in terms of how hard 
she’s working in improving other aspects of her game,” Wise said. “The triple-double doesn’t come without her defense. She is just 
now scratching the surface of what a great 
blocker she really is going to be before she finishes here.”
By continuing to improve her blocking, 
Murphy is as close to a complete player as there is in college volleyball. She says having 
the whole package makes her constant tran-
sition from setter to hitter easier, making the team more successful. 
“That’s basically what I’m thinking about 
when I’m rotating to the front and the back row,” Murphy said. “I have to switch roles 
and mindsets a bit.”Despite all the awards, Murphy knows 
she has areas to improve every day.
“There’s always a new match every week, 
and we want to win every match,” Murphy 
said. “That’s motivation enough.”
Gators go for 19 in a row against Semi-
noles: Murphy and the Gators will use that 
motivation tonight when they take on Flori-da State — the fifth straight match against a ranked opponent for Florida.
The Gators have won 18 consecutive 
matches against the Seminoles spanning back to 1994. 
Out of those matches, last year’s was the 
only one in which the Seminoles took more than one set, but the Gators won the close battle 3-2 (25-19, 23-25, 25-20, 22-25, 17-15) in 
the O’Connell Center.
“I think it’ll be a terrific volleyball match; 
high emotion,” Wise said. “Some of those matches haven’t been exactly the most pure 
volleyball, but highly contested.” 
The Gators will be tested by their rival’s 
home crowd and Florida State’s internation-al flavor. Of the 15 players on the Seminoles’ roster, eight hail from outside the United 
States.
“We really know little about their interna-
tional players,” Wise said. “These will be all new players to our team and it’ll be a huge 
challenge for them.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2010

UF setter Kelly Murphy has picked up three triple-doubles this season. She is averaging 3.11 kills per set, 5.33 assists per set and 
2.06 digs per set.
Addazio: Moody, Gillislee will receive more carries against Kentucky
Addazio said Emmanuel Moody and Mike Gillislee will 
be counted on to take some of those carries this weekend against Kentucky. 
In practice, the coaching staff is stressing starting series 
off with a better effort on first down so Brantley doesn’t have to convert 3rd-and-long situations as often as he did 
against the Volunteers. 
Senior offensive lineman Carl Johnson thinks improved communication on the field will fix a lot of the first-down 
problems, as missed assignments and failure to line up quickly hamstrung the offense. 
“We have to take more of our own lead-
ership role,” Johnson said. “We have a lot of mistakes out there starting with the line and all the way down to the running backs. We have a lot of miscommunication out there. Our talent is only going to keep us 
afloat for so long.”
In the end, Johnson said he will measure the team’s success in wins, not first-down yardage. Even though the offense has struggled with consistency from quarter-to-
quarter, series-to-series and even down-to-down, Johnson 
was encouraged by the team’s resiliency and 24-point second-half effort. 
“It’s football — the ball doesn’t bounce up and down. 
At the end of the day, I don’t really care how the offense is per se going-going,” Johnson said. “I just want to win. Isn’t that the main objective? Because no one remembers how the offense performs when you’re holding that crys-tal ball.”
NOTEBOOK , from page 16
UF has won 18 consecutive matches against FSU
VOLLEY , from page 16
Saturday, which led to some 
success by the Vols’ defense. If I noticed that, I’m sure UT’s 
coaching staff did, too. 
The first-down struggles 
forced Florida into 12 third-
down-and-long situations 
(seven yards or more) out of 
16 total third downs. This led to even more predictability as Addazio called 12 passing plays and just two running 
plays to adjust to the yardage 
needed — the other two third downs came as the clock ran 
out at the end of both halves. 
Football 101 says offenses 
need to mix running and 
passing plays to avoid tip-ping defenses off with ten-dencies they can take advan-
tage of. But predictability has 
been a problem for the Gators  since Addazio began calling 
plays last season.
However, nobody can ar -
gue with the man’s success. 
He has posted 16 wins to just 
one loss as UF’s offensive co-
ordinator.
Without the safety net of 
former Gators quarterback Tim Tebow, a couple of losses 
will be added to that record if 
he continues his trend of play calling, though.
Against South Florida on 
Sept. 11, it was Florida’s for -
mations that tipped its hand on offense.
The Gators ran 39 plays 
out of the shotgun and 26 of 
them — 67 percent — turned 
out to be passing plays. Meanwhile, 16 out of the 18 I-formation plays against the 
Bulls were run plays.
Much like how a good 
poker face correlates to mon-
ey earned when you turn in your chips, keeping defenses 
guessing leads to offensive 
success.
This is what is wrong with 
the offense.
Not the offensive line. Not 
the running backs. Not the quarterback. Not the wide receivers. 
Fans are calling the plays 
before the Gators even run them.CHIANG , from page 16

MIAMI — LeBron James might have 
been the most coveted basketball player on 
the planet this summer. It’ll likely be a differ -
ent story this fall.
At least in the fantasy basketball world.Sensing James will be hard-pressed to 
match the stats he posted in Cleveland now that he’s around other star-caliber players like Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Mi-ami, fantasy experts say the Heat forward shouldn’t be considered the automatic No. 1 pick in drafts taking place around the globe in the next few weeks.
In short, the NBA’s reigning two-time 
MVP might not be as valuable anymore in the stat-driven world.
“It’s the definition of ‘watered-down’ 
when you take a look at it,” said Sergio Gon-zalez, a fantasy analyst for CBSSports.com. “It’s the same thing that happened in Bos-
ton a couple years ago when Kevin Garnett 
and Ray Allen went there with Paul Pierce. There’s just not enough stats to go around for all these guys, who are used to being ‘The Guy’ on their teams.”
Gonzalez’s site predicts James to finish 
with 21.3 points, 8 assists and 7.6 rebounds per game — great numbers, yet not at the clip of 29.7 points, 8.6 assists and 7.3 rebounds 
he posted with the Cavaliers last season.
Most experts agree, while James might 
be the league’s most dynamic player, Kevin 
Durant will likely be the No. 1 pick in the fantasy draft world this season. James is typically slotted around the No. 3 spot on most draft boards, behind Durant and New Orleans guard Chris Paul.
On the day he signed with Miami, James 
said he couldn’t care less about his num-bers.
Still, it clearly stands to reason that James’ statline will dip now that he has Wade and Bosh alongside him.
“It’s probably not going to be as pro-
nounced as maybe the conventional wisdom right now,” said Brandon Funston, a fantasy expert for Yahoo! Sports. “In the fantasy game, at least in the Yahoo! fantasy game, the standard is to use nine categories. I think 
the only one you really see going down is points per game. Maybe a few assists 
go down because he won’t 
have the ball in his hands quite so often.”
James left Cleveland 
after seven seasons and was the biggest star in a summer of stardom on the 
NBA free agent market, eventually choosing to join Wade and Bosh in Miami as the Heat 
engineered one of the most sizable offseason 
overhauls in league history.
The Heat made the moves, of course, to win a title.
Which raises the question — will James, 
Bosh and Wade be helpful or hurtful come fantasy-title time at the end of the regular season?
“If they’re geared for a championship, 
they win a ton of games and blow teams out, then starters get rested ... you just don’t know what’s going to happen,” Funston said. “How good are they going to be? Are their starters going to be sitting in the fourth quarter? Come fantasy playoff time, will they be there when owners need them the most? I don’t know if there’s ever been a 
team with these good of players right in the 
middle of their prime.”
Either way, Gonzalez thinks fantasy bas-
ketball — which is growing — could easily see a big spike this season after the summer buzz.
“It’s going to open things up,” Gonzalez 
said. “We’re already starting to see people pick it up.”

Florida coach Urban Meyer 
pointed to quarterback John 
Brantley’s ability to convert 3rd-
and-longs against Tennessee as one of the positives to take from Saturday’s 31-17 victory.  
But it’s how Brantley and the 
offense got in those positions that makes the coaching staff ner -
vous. 
The Gators were 6 of 10 when 
needing seven yards or more to move the chains on third down, something they hope to not have 
to repeat this weekend. “Our first-down production, 
we’re off schedule too much,” 
offensive coordinator Steve Add-azio said. “What I mean by that is, you like to have four yards, whether you run or pass is irrel-evant. You like to stay on sched-ule, and we have to do better at that.”
Addazio elected to run 21 
times on first down and throw only seven times in the same sit-uation against the Volunteers to try to stay on that schedule. 
The Gators averaged just more 
than four yards per first-down rush attempt, while Brantley 
completed only two first-down 
passes for 18 yards, an average of 3.8 yards per play. 
Addazio said they made an ef-
fort to balance the run and pass plays on first down against South Florida the previous week but wanted to go with more under-center packages against UT be-
cause of the crowd noise in Ney-
land Stadium. 
Pounding the ball proved 
more successful on first downs, 
but it may have tired out their 
best big-play maker. 
The increase in first down 
rushes led to starting running back Jeff Demps, who is averag-
ing 6.9 yards per carry for the 
season, setting a career high with 26 carries for the game. 
“I think we really consciously 
try to watch the fatigue factor,” Addazio said of Demps, who also handles kickoff return duties. 
Demps averaged 2.8 yards 
per carry for the game due, in 
part, to the bigger workload, but

UF offensive coordinator Steve Addazio is looking to improve the offense’s success on first down. Quar -
terback John Brantley completed two passes on first down against Tennessee.
First-down failures put UF offense in tough spots
Let’s get this straight: The Gators 
aren’t purposefully struggling on offense.
Many of my friends have come to 
me with the idea that Urban Meyer and his cronies are showing a bland scheme in order to bust out an offen-
sive outburst against Alabama on Oct. 
2.
This is not going to happen because 
UF’s coaches don’t work this way. Fans were waiting for the same thing 
to happen last season before Florida 
was pummeled  in the Southeastern Conference Championship game.
There is only one reason the offense 
is struggling, and that’s because of the play-calling. 
Much like 
last season, fans 
can predict the 
upcoming play, sometimes mul-tiple plays in ad-
vance, correctly 
from their liv-ing rooms. And that’s the prob-
lem. Predictability.

azio called just seven first-down passing plays against Tennessee on Predictability, play-calling to
