Midtown’s only pizza joint will be back 
in business in the next two weeks.
Italian Gator Pizza By the Slice, a win-
dow-ordering pizza shop that closed Jan. 15 
for renovations, will be open before the sec-ond UF football game Sept. 10, said owner Joel Mills.
The restaurant, located at 1728 W. Uni-
versity Ave., will now have a second order-ing window and a higher-powered pizza oven. The parlor will also open an extra day — on Sundays, Mills said.
“We were forced to close, but it’s a good 
thing in the long run,” he said. “Everything will be brand-new and upgraded, and I’ll be able to put out a lot more pizza a lot faster.”
He said the restaurant, which ﬁ  rst 
opened in 2000, will offer more pizza top-pings and a specialty pizza every day. To accommodate for the expected sales in-crease, Mills said he hopes to hire four more employees.
“We’ll still have the staples, though,” 
Mills said. “We’ll still have garlic rolls.”
At Midtown, the restaurant’s late hours 
cater to hungry students leaving clubs and 
bars along West University Avenue.
Allison Petkoff, a UF health science 
sophomore, said she has missed Pizza by 
the Slice since it closed.

za,” the 19-year-old said. “I remember try-Pizza By the Slice  to reopen

Hungry students leaving Midtown bars 
now have a new option for late-night 
munchies.
Dank Cakes, a bakery stand that sells 
fried Oreos and funnel cakes, opened 
Wednesday night outside the Baptist Colle-giate Ministries on West University Avenue. 
Started by two Gainesville entrepre-
neurs, the business will operate from 9 p.m. 
to 2 a.m. from Wednesday to Sunday.
Gene Gamble, a co-owner, said the stand 
should appeal to both students and fami-
lies, although Midtown patrons will likely 
make up a large chunk of his sales.
“I can guarantee that people are going 
to have more memories at Dank Cakes than 
they actually had at the bar,” Gamble said.
Prices for the stand’s sweet treats range 
from $5 to $9, and toppings include Nutel-la, ice cream and fresh bananas. A portion of the stand’s revenues will be paid to the Baptist student center, Gamble said.
Gamble runs the stand with Alexander 
Black, a UF alumnus who co-owns Gaines-
ville-based UFit Meals. Gamble, a Uni-versity of South Florida alumnus, owns a 
company that makes smoking accessories, 
and he once managed U.S. swimmer and 
UF alumnus Ryan Lochte’s short-lived TV show.
Gamble said he and Black plan to even-
tually expand to a physical store but are cur-
rently focused on marketing Dank Cakes.
Andrew Congress, a UF event manage-
ment senior, tried the stand’s fried Oreos on Friday night.
“It was like an explosion of chocolate 
and, like, indulgence,” he said. 
After Congress took a bite, he closed his 
eyes and tilted his head back before raising 
his chocolate-covered hands.
“See that?” Black said. “That’s the dank 
face.”  Dank bakery opens in MidtownSEE PIZZA , PAGE  4

UF RecSports is opening a new 
on-campus outdoor sports equip-
ment rental center today.
The 6,000 square-foot Center 
for Outdoor Recreation and Edu-cation will be located right behind Southwest Recreation Center. It will be open seven days a week, allowing students to rent paddle-
boards, shoes, dry bags, life jack-
ets, lanterns, kayaks and camping 
gear.
Students can rent equipment for 
up to one week, said Jackie Mat-
thews, the coordinator for CORE. 
Prices will range between $1 for 
a paddling map and $60 for an in-ﬂ  atable paddle board for about a 
week’s worth of use. 
CORE is still working on con-
ﬁ  rming prices and rental time, she 
said. Rentals can only be made 
with a credit card, so students can 
be charged late fees if necessary. 
“There is an opportunity for 
students to explore their local area 
and to experience new things to-gether as a community,” Matthews 
said. 
Those interested can also sign 
up for one- to three-day weekend 
trips across the east coast, she said. 
Trips are led by CORE’s trained 
Travel and Recreation Program 
leaders, who have their Wilderness 
First Responder certiﬁ  cations. This 
teaches survival skills and emer-gency management. 
Gracie Minton, a UF exploratory 
engineering freshman, said she’s 
interested in renting equipment to 
use in her hometown of Tampa.
“The new CORE facility will 
make beach trips so much more 
fun,” the 18-year-old said.
CORE’s grand opening will be 
Sept. 16 from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.  New facility allows students to rent outdoor gearBOTTLED UPSubscription Rate: Full Year (All Semesters)  $100Not ofﬁ  cially associated with the University of Florida

there and was so upset when I realized it would

Petkoff said she goes to Midtown about once 
a week, and she and her friends always consider 
Pizza By the Slice for their midnight snacks.
“It’s just so convenient and affordable,” she 
said. “Everyone knows about Pizza by the Slice. 
Everyone’s tried it.”
Mills said over the eight months the restaurant 
has been closed, hundreds of loyal customers mes-saged the restaurant’s Facebook page to ask when their favorite pizza place would come back. 
“We’ve posted a few updates of construction along the way, and we’ve had an absolutely great 
response,” Mills said. 
On its page, customers watched the renova-
tions unfold. In July, the restaurant posted a photo 
of a mechanical lift and a worker installing wood 
panelling on the new building. Facebook users ex-
pressed their excitement in the comments section.
“The suspense is killing me,” one Facebook 
user posted.
Mills said he is looking forward to catching the 
crowds for the Fall football season.
“Our goal is to be open no later than the sec-
ond Gator game,” Mills said. “We’re gonna jump in right where we left off.”

Some splashed body paint 
over their breasts, and others wore nothing but leopard-print Speedos.
On Friday night, dozens of 
students and residents rode their bicycles about 8 miles across Gainesville to call attention to bicyclists being struck by cars in 
the city.
As a part of Critical Ass: the 
3rd nipple!, the group of about 60 
cyclists began the hourlong “roll-ing protest” at The Freewheel 
Project, located at 618 S. Main 
St., and traveled up to Southwest 
34th Street, said Ana Fajardo, the outreach and programs coordina-tor at the bicycle shop.
“We’re here and we’re frag-
ile,” Fajardo said. “Nudity is very parallel to showing how vulner-able we are.”
The event was held in con-
junction with the World Naked 
Bike Ride  that happened on 
June 25 in Portland, Oregon, for the same reason. Friday marked the third year the event was held in Gainesville, but it was the first time The Freewheel Project hosted it. Previously, the event 
had been managed by Pleasant 
Cyclery, another bike shop in 
Gainesville.
Fajardo said The Freewheel 
Project decided to continue the 
annual protest because bicyclists 
are just as vulnerable now as 
they were three years ago.
In 2014, 726 bicyclists were 
killed in crashes with motor vehi-
cles, according to the Pedestrian 
and Bicycle Information Center.
Fajardo said bicyclists usually 
try to ride on major streets in or-
der to evoke a stronger message. 
This year they rode from 
Southwest Second Avenue to 
Southwest 34th Street before cut-ting through campus and heading back downtown to the bike shop.Before the cyclists started their 
ride, they bunched together and raved about how excited they were to begin.
Riders, gathered in about 10 
groups of three to five riders, complied with Florida indecent exposure laws, but just barely, Fajardo said.
“I think according to Florida 
law we can’t be fully naked,” she said. “There’s lots of body paint, (and) sometimes people wear 
nipple pasties. People usually just 
cover their private parts.”

old UF sustainabilities studies se-
nior, dressed in a bra and shorts 
as she rode with her friends Fri-
day. During her time as a student, 
she has been hit twice by cars while riding off campus.
And although the crashes only 
resulted in minor injuries like 
cuts and scrapes, she said riding 
through the city is frustrating.
“On campus biking is really 
easy,” she said, “but once you’re 
off campus it’s really hard be-
cause there’s no bike lanes.”Nearly naked and afraid: dozens of bicyclists ride in protest

Gainesville Police arrested a lo-
cal man Saturday after they said he jumped into a pool to hide about 10 grams of crack cocaine.
At about 1:15 a.m. Saturday, Mi-
chael Harrison, 43, sat in the pas-senger seat of a car as police pulled over its driver in the 1300 block of SW 21st Ave., according to a police report. The driver didn’t stop at a stop sign.
As police approached the car, 
Harrison appeared to be glancing at the floor. When police found mari-juana crumbs in the car and asked Harrison to take off his right sock, he ran.
Harrison entered the courtyard of 
a hotel in the 2900 block of SW 13th St., where he jumped into a pool, ac-cording to the report. Inside, he took off his right sock.
When police attempted to arrest 
him, Harrison swam to the opposite 
side of the pool, according to the re-
port. Police then used pepper spray 
on Harrison and took him out of the 
pool.
At the bottom of the pool, police 
found a bag of crack cocaine weigh-
ing about 10 grams, according to the 
report.
Police charged Harrison with 
tampering with evidence, resisting 
arrest and possessing cocaine with 
intent to sell, manufacture or deliver. 
Authorities took him to the Ala-
chua County Jail, where he remains, as of press time, in lieu of a $60,000 
bond.

The UF Supreme Court is hold-
ing a meeting Tuesday to set rules 
to hear petitions submitted by stu-dents.
At 5 p.m. in Room 285C at the 
UF Levin College of Law, the court will go over procedures in order to hear two petitions, said UF Su-preme Court Chief Justice Chris Tribbey. About 40 student peti-tioners are asking the court to re-consider an opinion made June 25. 
Tribbey said determining if and 
how many students can speak at the next meeting, Sept. 6, and for how long, will be a focus of Tues-day’s meeting. 
“I think people should feel like 
they’re being heard,” Tribbey said. “I would encourage those who are interested to be present.” 
Over summer, the court over-
turned four amendments after in-
terpreting the UF constitution. 
According to Alligator archives, 
the overturned amendments in-
cluded allowing remote online 
voting, reducing the number of 
available senate seats, reducing 
the amount of petition signatures 
needed from the Student Body — 
raising it from 5 percent back to 
10 percent — and adding genetic 
information in Student Govern-
ment’s anti-discriminatory policy.
Petitions submitted before 
Thursday will be addressed Sept. 6 at the same time and location as 
Tuesday’s meeting, Tribbey said. 
“The interest would be to make 
it as efficient and fair as possible,” 
he said. “That should be the goal.”  
Because SG is mandated by the Florida Legislature, it’s required to post about meetings within a rea-
sonable amount of time to abide 
state law.
Savannah Patterson, a UF food 
and resource economics junior, 
said she would like the court to be 
more transparent.
“I’m a junior, and I know very 
little about that part of campus 
and student life,” the 20-year-old 
said. 
 Patterson said she would like 
a reliable way to find information 
about the court and its meetings.
“As far as I know, there’s no 
way to access what exactly is go-ing on,” she said. “At least a Face-
book page or something.”

For helping save a motorist from a burn-
ing car Thursday, a Lake City man and a 
Gainesville man will each receive an award for his bravery.
At about 11 p.m. Thursday, Lance Mac-
Donald, of Lake City, noticed a mangled car engulfed in ﬂ  ames in the 6300 block of NW 39th Ave. At the time, the 40-year-old was driving home from his son’s football game in 
Gainesville, MacDonald said. 
The sports car had rolled over several 
times and hit a concrete pole, and its driver 
sat trapped inside.
MacDonald stopped on the side of the road 
and joined a group of bystanders gathering around the ﬂ  aming car. 
“There was no time to think,” he said. “It 
was very scary.”
After MacDonald managed to open the 
driver’s door and take off his seat belt, 34-year-
old Kris Holt, of Gainesville, helped pull the 
man to safety. By that time, ﬁ  re had spread to the man’s feet and legs, MacDonald said.
After they got the man out, the residents 
pulled him about 20 feet away from the car, and Alachua County Sheriff’s Deputy Joe Sperring arrived on the scene. After the man stopped breathing, Sperring said he performed 
CPR for several minutes until paramedics ar-
rived.
After the adrenaline had worn off follow-
ing the rescue, MacDonald said he thought of his own son and the parents of the driver.
“I stayed up all night, and all I could think 
was the parents of the young man getting a knock or a call,” he said. “I’m glad that his parents still have their son here.”
The man suffered a brain injury during the 
crash but has been walking and talking since then, said Michael Cowart, the Gainesville Fire Rescue operations chief.
In January, both MacDonald and Holt will 
receive Life Safety awards from the sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce.
Asked about the recognition, MacDonald 
brushed off any praise, contending he was 
just in the right place at the right time.

He built it, and they came.
After months of planning and nearly 
$5,000 in donations, Gainesville Police Ofﬁ  cer Bobby White held a grand opening Sunday for his latest community basketball court.
Located behind the Upper Room of Greater 
Gainesville church, 3575 NE 15th St., the full-
sized court came with two adjustable hoops 
and a “Hoops Not Crime” insignia at its cen-ter.
The hoop was built as part of his Basket-
ball Cop Foundation, which White started af-
ter a video of him playing basketball with kids 
following a noise complaint amassed millions 
of views on the department’s Facebook page.
On Sunday, 7-year-old Jaheim Black took 
jump shots from all over the court. He plays 
basketball nearly every weekend, his mother, Keda Sermons, said, but he had not lived near 
any courts. However, since the court opened 
three weeks ago, Black has become a regular.
“It’s good so we don’t have to walk so far,” 
Sermons said, adding that occupying Black’s time with a sport may keep him from turning to neighborhood-driven crime.
Karl Anderson, a church senior pastor, said 
there has been an increase in gang activity on Northeast 15th Street recently, which often leads the area’s youth down a path of crime.
“We’re combatting with unity,” he said. 
“We’re combatting with something healthy and fun.”
At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, attended 
by about 40 people, White, GPD Chief Tony 
Jones and Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Dar-
nell spoke about the importance of building 
police-community relations.
The new court is the second project White 
has completed in the city. His ﬁ  rst court was built in February at the site of the viral video.
For his next project, White said he wants 
to build a court at an apartment complex else-
where in the city.
“If the community wants to keep this go-
ing,” he said, “keep supporting.”

OPINIONS EDITORWhat do you get when you mix a massive oil pipeline, 
an unregulated oil market and a Native American pro-test movement making international headlines? The next Quentin Tarantino Western movie… or what’s happening in North Dakota.
Energy Transfer Partners, a massive energy company, is in the 
process of completing its Dakota Access oil pipeline project. Right on the pipeline’s path, however, is the Missouri River and terri-tory the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe considers sacred.
You’re probably wondering which side you should take. May-
be you’re tired of the white corporate man taking Native Ameri-can land. Maybe you’re tired of your leftist softy friends’ anti-corporatism and want some thick tax revenue from domestic oil investments. No matter your predispositions, you should take a 
moment to understand the massive economic and environmental 
consequences that will come from this pipeline if it’s erected.
North Dakota oil regions aren’t doing so great. Since 2015, 
after riding high on an eight-year oil boom, residents from the Williston, North Dakota, and Bakken oil-ﬁ  eld areas have been re-locating, sales tax revenue dropped signiﬁ  cantly and debts have built up, according to a Reuters investigation.
This is because all of the massive growth in southern North 
Dakota from 2006 to 2014 came from only one industry. Now 
that world oil prices have dropped, there aren’t any other mar-
kets in the region to stem the tide.
This is what happened to Detroit after the recession and auto 
industry crisis. It’s what’s happened to southern North Dakota for the past year and it’s what will continue to happen should this pipeline come to fruition: a boom and then a devastating bust.
We haven’t even gotten to the fun part yet. What happens if 
this pipeline spills and destroys nearby farmland or pollutes wa-ter sources, such as the Missouri River? Energy Transfers claims 
protecting the local environment is a “top priority,” but the track 
record of oil companies in North Dakota maintaining environ-mentally responsible is — how do you say — not good.
In their 2014 investigation, The New York Times found that 
from 2006 to early October 2014, “more than 18.4 million gallons of oils and chemicals spilled, leaked or misted into the air, soil and waters of North Dakota.” And if these spills get onto farmers’ lands, it wrecks their territory for good.
As if this weren’t bleak enough, the regulatory authority over 
North Dakota, the Industrial Commission, doesn’t do what it should. Even when the commission does penalize and impose ﬁ  nes on oil companies, they usually settle for only 10 percent of the penalties, The New York Times found. 
The result? From 2006 to 2014, the commission collected $1.1 
million in ﬁ  nes, while Texas collected over $33 million from ﬁ  nes when producing four times as much oil as North Dakota.
And the cherry on top? The head of the commission, North 
Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple, accepts campaign contributions 
from big oil companies; as recently as 2012, he accepted $25,000 
from the chief executive of the state’s second-biggest oil producer.
So, here we have an oil market in decline with a history of en-
vironmental damage, a regulatory agency that’s so hands-off it’d give a libertarian an orgasm and oil regulators that accept money from oil executives. What could possibly go wrong?
If any of you are still in doubt, which is your right as free 
thinkers, at least consider this: Leonardo DiCaprio came out on Twitter against the pipeline to say, “Inspired by the Stand-
ing Rock Sioux’s efforts to alt the Dakota Access Pipeline.” If the 
pipeline isn’t good enough for Leo, it’s not good enough for us at the Alligator. 
How legitimate are presidential polls, really?
Let’s face it: People are impatient. And as the future’s chances of signiﬁ  cantly changing people’s lives increases, the more impatient people become. Election results in November could push, or vio-
lently shove, America in the wrong direction for the next four years, which is why Americans look to presidential polls for a glimpse into what the future holds. The problem is that presiden-tial polls are becoming as legitimate as the can-didates themselves.
Before the Democratic National Convention, news 
channels were reporting presidential polls that showed Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in a close tie, which 
seemed surprising no matter how unlikeable Clinton can 
be at times. Then it hit me: I’ve never been polled. I mean, I’ve never even gotten a call to turn down the survey to poll me.
One would think as technology makes interpersonal 
communication easier, polling organizations would gather accurate information more efﬁ  ciently. But alas, polling or-ganizations are still behind on technology. According to an article from The New York Times, even the survey organi-
zations, like the Pew Research Center, conduct one land-
line interview for every two on the cellphone. However, because cellphone polling is more expensive, sample sizes are also shrinking considerably, making it more difﬁ  cult for organizations to capture accurate results.
Another problem with survey polling is the surveys 
themselves. Surveys have skewed results that incentivize more passionate responders to partake in the survey, limit-ing responses from those whose opinions aren’t as strong. 
The growing number of apathetic voters is revealed by 
presidential polling response rates as low as 8 percent for even the more legitimate organizations. This explains why some polls showed Trump winning a couple of months ago and Trump now closing in on Clinton’s lead this week, even after the numerous mistakes he’s made lately. Al-though there are different opinions on who should be the next U.S. president, there is no discrepancy between which candidate has more dedicated supporters. While Trump rallies gather supporters fueled with rage and testosterone, support for Clinton can be represented by the slogan “Hillary! I can live with that.”
News channels are as much at fault as the 
polling organizations themselves. As poli-tics become more polarizing, so do the news outlets that are supposed to hold an objective voice when educating Americans on the world around us. Instead, news channels have substi-
tuted legitimacy for ratings.
As Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig reported in his 
book “Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress — 
and a Plan to Stop It,” viewers will pay more attention to 
more extreme news outlets that lean the same way they do politically. But what kind of world would we live in if news channels just reported what people want to hear? The Washington Post gathered data on how the media re-ported presidential polls in the past, and the results weren’t pretty.
In 2008, the average results of all presidential polls had 
President Barack Obama predicted to win. However, the 
individual polls that showed Obama and John McCain tied 
received the most air time. This election cycle, no matter how many times Trump insults different groups across the board, polls somehow almost always show a close margin between Trump and Clinton. I guess the truth is taking a backseat when analyzing what could be a deciding event in this country’s future.
The illegitimacy of presidential polls is rooted in the ob-
solete manner in which polling organizations gather views. 
And until polling organizations can provide more accurate 
results with higher response rates and randomization, me-dia outlets shouldn’t report illegitimate polls. Reporting on the everyday events of, say, Trump and Kim Kardashian may be low-brow reporting, but almost anything is better than reporting inaccurate results to the American public.

corruption: a North 
Dakota bedtime storyMONDAY, AUGUST 29, 2016   ALLIGATOR   7
There was once a ﬁ  sherman 
who lived on an island with his family. Every day he would catch enough ﬁ  sh to feed himself and 
his family. Then he would enjoy the rest of the day with his wife and children, playing guitar, sing-ing and dancing throughout the night.
One day, a well-versed businessman 
noticed the ﬁ  sherman on his island and 
visited him. The businessman had a Mas-ter of Business Administration and said he could help the ﬁ  sherman become more successful, suggesting he spend more time 
ﬁ  shing. The ﬁ  sherman could catch as 
many ﬁ  sh as possible, save money, buy a larger vessel and then catch more ﬁ  sh. Eventually, the ﬁ  sherman would be able 
to buy a whole ﬂ  eet of boats, have his 
own company and maybe even start his own production and distribution ancillary business. It would not be long before his business grew 10 times larger, with net-
works and clients at every port.
Upon hearing the businessman’s sug-
gestion, the ﬁ  sherman replied, “And after 
that?”
The businessman laughed and said, 
“After that, you can live like a king in your own house, maybe invest in the stock ex-change and be rich!”
“And after that?” the ﬁ  sherman asked.
“After that, you can ﬁ  nally retire, live 
by a nice ﬁ  shing village, catch a few ﬁ  sh 
in the morning and then return home to be with your children and wife, playing 
guitar, singing and dancing throughout 
the night,” the businessman said.
“But isn’t that what I am doing now?” 
asked the ﬁ  sherman.
This parable is not one with an anti-
work or anti-ambition message. It is not advocating laziness or closed-mindedness and it is by no means a story to cite when you don’t feel like putting more effort into 
something. What this parable does, how-
ever, is paint a beautifully simple picture of the true work-life balance. The ﬁ  sher-man realized what the businessman could not: Even if the ﬁ  sherman went through 
all of that effort to expand his business, his ultimate “reward” would be 
something he already had.
In a culture that has begun to 
discourage (and even look down 
upon) work-life balance as a 
serious consideration in one’s professional life, this parable speaks a forgotten truth. With 
the advent of smartphones, 
communicative technology is 
found in front pockets, on kitchen coun-ters and on nightstands at all hours of the day. What results is that the line between 
work and home life becomes blurred. 
What used to be two deﬁ  nitive circles of life are now merging.
Thanks to these devices being so close 
to the heart, the “nine-to-ﬁ  ve” now contin-ues to hover over the shoulders of work-ers, looming in the shadows after hours.
With articles online titled “Instead of 
Work-Life Balance, Try to Achieve Work-Life Integration,” we are encouraged to seamlessly combine the two sectors of our 
lives. And all that for what? To relax and 
spend more time with our families? Re-member the ﬁ  sherman.
One thing I think the parable left out 
was the massive time sacriﬁ  ce required for the businessman’s plan. After all of the 
years the ﬁ  sherman would have wasted on 
the businessman’s plan, his kids would be fully grown, and his desire to spend more time with his family? Ruined.
Money will always be there, but you 
can’t buy back time with your family and loved ones. The ﬁ  sherman knew this, and this was why he declined the business-man’s offer.
Work-life balance is something that 
should be prioritized, not discouraged. It all boils down to the personal ranking of 
two values: time and money. One will al-
ways be available. The other, well, not so much.
Andrew Hall is a UF economics junior. 
His column usually appears on Fridays.A widely known article, “The Tragedy of Com-mons” written by Gar-
rett Hardin, is used in 
many ﬁ  elds to analyze 
human behavior. The tragedy is an economic problem that 
occurs when individuals ex-
ploit a common or shared re-source. As a result, the demand overwhelms supply, and the resource becomes unavailable to other 
groups. Individuals neglect the well-being 
of the group in pursuit of personal gain without regard for others; individuals ben-eﬁ  t in the short term but the group loses 
in the long run. This situation has impli-
cations for the use of resources, sustain-ability and the depletion of nonrenewable resources. And all of these factors coalesce in the grand catastrophe our generation 
faces: global warming — the increase of 
Earth’s average surface temperature due to a ton of emissions or pollutants, like car-bon dioxide emissions from the production 
and incineration of plastic bags.
Understanding Hardin’s article sheds 
light on how an individual’s behavior af-
fects other people. He argues that when individuals think of resources as common, 
they can then recognize the need to man-
age responsibly over these resources. Bet-ter management over “common” resources prevents the degradation of our environ-
ment because the freedoms and diverse 
interests of everyday people are better pre-served and nurtured. What people consid-er when they use common resources is not only for short-term beneﬁ  ts, but also for 
long-term beneﬁ  ts: People begin to natu-
rally prioritize sustainability.
Consider water: Every human being 
needs it, and thus it’s in everyone’s best 
interest to manage the use of water re-
sponsibly and preserve it for as long as possible.
In my view, the consequences of not 
thinking this way are too dangerous: We 
certainly do not want ﬂ  oods or droughts, 
hurricanes or other storms, rising sea lev-els or any further melting of the glaciers. There are no other solutions except prop-
erly sustaining our environment. And practicing an environmentally sustainable lifestyle isn’t as 
far-fetched as you might think: Think of plastic bags.
 Most people — hopefully — 
understand that the more we use plastic bags, the more our environment suffers. The prob-lem begins when individuals place too much responsibility 
on others. Most people convince 
themselves other people will act sustain-
ably and use alternative bags, justifying their own use of plastic bags. But what 
happens when even slight majorities of 
people think this way? In the long run, we may not avoid disasters from environmen-tal impacts because we’ve already done enough damage over the past century.
Fortunately, some supermarkets have 
already taken matters into their own hands. Trader Joe’s, for instance, a neigh-borhood grocery store, uses paper bags 
to reduce the use of plastics. Wal-Mart 
has used recycled plastic bags that have ”Please return to participating store for recycling” written on them. Dollar Tree, Inc., an American chain of discount vari-
ety stores, has the same idea in its plastic 
bags.
But how many people actually know 
this information or care enough to use this 
information to prevent the environmental 
impacts? Every year more than 500 billion plastic bags are distributed, and less than 10 percent of those bags are recycled. They are typically made of polyethylene and can 
take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade in 
landﬁ  lls that produce harmful emissions.
It’s very simple: If we want to continue 
using this space on the planet we’ve been 
given and live out our lives as we wish, we 
need to act. In fact, we’ve needed to act for generations, and while we’re making some progress, we’re nowhere near where we need to be. Each of you can contribute 
to progress or the natural lazy, dismissive 
attitude toward global warming that our culture promotes. Which path do you want to promote?

“What this parable does, 
however, is paint a beautifully 
simple picture of the true 
work-life balance.”ABOUT 70 PEOPLE MARCHED IN 
THE PARADE.
By Martin Vassolo
Alligator Staff Writer
Led by a thumping three-piece band, doz-
ens of voters marched to the polls Saturday 
afternoon.
As part of the inaugural Parade to the 
Polls, a crowd of about 70 people traveled more than a mile from First Magnitude Brew-ing Company to the Alachua County Supervi-
sor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce. The parade took place 
on the last day of early voting before Tues-day’s primary election. 
Kyle Giest, a UF alumnus who co-orga-nized the parade, said the goal of the after-
noon was to remind residents of the primary 
— and of the importance of local politics.
“Local politics shape your city and your 
life,” he said, “and you know, with the spec-
tacle of Trump versus Hillary, I think people 
don’t see what’s actually going on on a local level.” 
As Giest led the pack, hauling UF student 
and drummer Noah Hinrichsen on a pedicab, 
students and residents followed close behind, 
most of whom played kazoos. Behind them, a pink-haired student juggled as another rode on a unicycle. Circling around, a resident 
drove an electric scooter decorated to look 
like a narwhal.
“Voting’s kind of boring when you’re go-ing by yourself,” Giest said. “Let’s make it 
fun.”
The group was joined on the march by two 
incumbent Democratic Alachua County com-
missioners, Mike Byerly and Robert Hutchin-
son, whose respective District 1 and 3 seats 
are up for grabs in the primary.
Participants waved banners promoting the 
commissioners and, at points, held up trafﬁ  c after they cut through Depot Park and walked 
down North Main Street to downtown.
The parade lasted about 45 minutes, with a 
handful of water breaks taken intermittently.
Maureen Murtha, a 28-year-old UF alumna, 
said she wants Gainesville to stay “weird” and 
not become an overly commercialized city, vi-sions she said both commissioners share.Losses for Hutchinson and Byerly, she 
said, would give a green light to land develop-ers looking to turn Gainesville into a sprawl-ing commercial metropolis.
“They just see the future of Gainesville as 
following in the footsteps of other cities in the state of Florida,” she said. “We don’t want to look like Tampa.”
Hutchinson, who is running against fel-
low Democrat Larry McDaniel in Tuesday’s 
primary, said he was happy to see voters so 
passionate about the election.
“It’s good fun at this point,” he said. “The 
hard part is over.”

After opening the 2016 regular 
season with two easy-going home 
wins, Florida’s soccer team faced 
its first obstacle on Friday night 
in Palo Alto, California, falling to Stanford in a 1-0 overtime loss.The No. 6 Gators (3-1) 
bounced back on Sunday night, defeating No. 15 UCLA 4-3 at Drake Stadium in overtime be-hind a strong performance from 
All-American senior forward Sa-
vannah Jordan.
Jordan scored two goals and 
entered Sunday’s contest tied for first in the Southeastern Confer-ence and tied for fourth in the 
NCAA in total points scored.
Florida wasted little time of-
fensively, netting its first goal 
less than three minutes into the game off a header from Jordan.
UCLA (2-1) then returned the 
favor in the fifth minute with a goal from senior Annie Alvarado. 
"I thought we really came 
out after them at the beginning and that is what we wanted," UF coach Becky Burleigh said in a 
release. 
"It was kind of a back and 
forth game for a while."

The Florida football team has playmak-
ers throughout its roster, but will one player stand out from the rest this season? In the 
second edition of the alligatorSports round-
table, football writers Ethan Bauer, Ian Co-hen, Jordan McPherson and Patrick Pinak predict who will be Florida’s Most Valuable 
Player in 2016.BAUER: Dre Massey
Dre Massey might be an unfamiliar 
name right now, but by the end of the sea-
son, it could be as familiar as Antonio Cal-laway. 
For the Gators to be contenders, they’ll 
need unknowns to step up, because while the established players have been good, they haven’t been good enough. 
Massey, a junior college transfer who 
has played everything from quarterback to punter, will be a receiver at Florida and will also contribute in the return game. 
Listed as 5-foot-9 and 180 pounds, he’s 
hardly the statuesque receiver people pic-ture as a potential MVP. He’s no Calvin Johnson or Julio Jones. 
But he makes plays. 
As a high school quarterback in South 
Carolina, Massey threw for 2,798 yards 
and 28 touchdowns while adding 2,050 rushing yards and 34 touchdowns on the 
ground. 
In junior college, he continued to put up 
points and chew up turf en route to MACJC 
All-State and First Team All-Region honors. 
And at Florida, he expects more of the 
same. 
But Southeastern Conference defenses 
will be unlike anything he’s faced before. 
“We just go,” he said of his time in 
JUCO. “If you’re good, you’re good.”
That won’t fly when everyone is good. 
So why do I think he could finish 2016 as Florida’s best?
Well, guys like Texas A&M’s Christian 
Kirk have shown that undersized receivers who can return kicks, make people miss and spray dirt on slower defenders can carve out prominent places in the SEC. 
And Callaway showed just last year that 
a guy can come in and ignite a team right away. 
Because he's done just that at his two 
previous stops, Massey will start as an un-known and finish as UF's best. 
COHEN: Eddy Pineiro
In the race for MVP, here’s why Eddy 
Pineiro has the disadvantage.
He isn’t the star quarterback. He isn’t 
the flashy receiver or the bulky defensive 
lineman or the shutdown corner. 
He’ll probably only be on the field for 
a handful of plays per game, most of them 
serving an inconsequential role such as 
kickoff duty.
And yet, Pineiro may decide the out-
come of more games than any other player on UF’s roster.
Florida’s kicker will be the MVP, and 
you only have to look back one season to see why.

For the fourth time in program 
history, the Florida volleyball team 
opened up its season against the 
No. 1-ranked team in the country. 
And while the Gators lost their 
first game on Friday, Florida 
bounced back with a win on Sat-
urday to end its road trip 1-1.
Here’s how it happened:
It began promisingly enough. 
Squaring off against defending 
national champions Nebraska at the VERT Challenge, No. 10 Flori-da stole the first set of its season-opener in extra points, claiming an early advantage over the top-ranked Cornhuskers. 
For all of its energy, however, 
UF’s youthful side was soon worn down. 
Plagued by inconsistency and 
bad luck, the Gators wilted under Nebraska’s unrelenting attack, 
dropping their remaining three 
sets and kicking off a new era of Florida volleyball on an inauspi-cious note with a 3-1 loss on Fri-
day. 
“There is a reason they are the 
preseason No. 1-ranked team,” head coach Mary Wise said of Ne-
braska in a release. “They’re very efficient and low error.”
All-American middle blocker 
Rhamat Alhassan — UF’s active 
career leader in hitting efficiency 
(.437) — had an off-night, finish-ing with a .188 hitting percent-
age and failing to register a single 
solo block. 
The disconnect extended to the service game as well. UF 
managed a single service ace to 
Nebraska’s five, committing 10 service errors in the process. 
One rally in the second set en-
capsulated the Gators’ night. De-spite rejecting the Cornhuskers at the net three separate times, a fi-
nal block bounced off a Nebraska 
players' head, falling in between Florida’s defense for a soft kill. 
This early into a new sea-
son, though, in-game chemistry remains a major key. Its effect was amplified given the amount 
of fresh talent populating UF’s 
bench. 
“It was the first time Shainah 
Joseph has played the O2, first 
time Caroline Knop has worn the 
libero jersey, first start for Taelor Kellum, the first time Allie Grego-ry, Darrielle King, Morgyn Greer, Rachael Kramer and Chanelle 
Hargreaves have played in a col-
lege match,” Wise said. 
“That’s a lot of ‘firsts’ against 
the defending national cham-
pions. We’re an awfully young team to go toe-to-toe with such 
an experienced team this early in 
the season."
***
Late into the fourth set of Flor-
ida’s second weekend match, un-ranked Oregon was pushing UF to 
the limit. 
A poorly struck ball by UF 
sophomore Taelor Kellum gave Oregon a 24-21 lead, and the 
Ducks needed one more point to 
extend the match to a decisive fifth set.
The 2,146-person crowd that 
filled Matthew Knight Arena was loud.
Then Carli Snyder and Alex 
Holston happened.
The duo combined for four of 
the Gators’ final five points to take the fourth set 26-24, giving 
the Gators (1-1) their first win of 
the season on Saturday night. 
Snyder led the team with 16 
kills, including six in the fourth set, and also added 13 digs. 
“Carli Snyder was just All-
American all weekend,” Wise said after the game. “She was fantastic.”
A big surprise for Florida was 
the play of Kellum, a 6-foot-2 middle blocker who recorded only three kills all last season.
On Saturday night, she had 
nine.
“That’s Taelor Kellum’s debut, 
and she did a terrific job,” Wise said.
Team captain Alhassan had a 
solid night, following up her 10-kill outing against Nebraska on Friday with a 12-kill performance against Oregon. 
The 6-foot-4 junior also tallied 
eight total blocks, recording her first solo block of the season in the process. 
Holston, the team’s lone se-
nior, struggled early on in the match but rebounded, recording 14 kills and six total blocks.
Her six kills in the fourth set 
were a key part in the Gators’ comeback victory. 
“(We) just had that ‘refuse to 
lose’ mentality,” Wise said. “I felt 
like we grew up so much playing 
against a team like Oregon. … It’s a huge win after just 24 hours, dropping to Nebraska.”

Nebraska is ranked No. 1
UCLA freshman goaltender Teagan Micah to take back the 
lead for the Gators.
The Bruins rallied in the second half, seizing a 3-2 lead 
after freshman Jessie Fleming notched back-to-back goals in the 65th and 69th minutes.
UF’s defense shut down the Bruins from then on, setting 
up Jordan to tally an equalizer in the 73rd minute off an 
assist from redshirt senior Erika Nelson.
In overtime, luck was on Florida’s side after a cross 
from Jordan deflected off a UCLA defender to score an own 
goal and seal the victory for the Gators.
"I thought it showed a lot of resilience on our part to get 
the goal in overtime," Burleigh said. 
"We are excited to get the W and head back home."UF will next travel to Tallahassee to take on the Florida 
State Seminoles at 7 p.m. on Friday. FSU is ranked No. 1 in 
the country and is 3-0 this season.

and after misses, even after PATs 
sailed through the uprights, and, at times, even when he stepped 
on the ﬁ  eld for the kickoff.
Enter Pineiro.
The junior college transfer 
routinely kicks 60-yard ﬁ  eld 
goals during practice and made a 
56-yarder during UF’s Orange and Blue Debut in April. 
So now that Florida has a com-
petent place kicker — one that, 
at the very least, should be able 
to consistently knock down ﬁ  eld goals within 30 yards — scoring three points will cease to be as 
painful  of an experience as slow-
ly pulling off a bandage.
And extra points shouldn’t be 
an issue either.
“Yeah, I didn’t think people 
were going to scream out my name after an extra point,” Pin-eiro said, “so that was pretty in-teresting.”
Get used to it, Eddy.
McPHERSON: Jarrad Davis
Florida’s success this season 
will run through its defense.
And the defense runs through 
Jarrad Davis.
The senior linebacker is the 
group’s leader, both on and off 
the ﬁ  eld. The team rallies around 
him.
And he can make just about 
every play he has to in order to 
ensure the defense comes out on top.
Davis, a 6-foot-2, 238-pound 
wrecking ball, is the Gators’ lead-ing returning tackler from last season (98). He can stop the run 
(11 tackles for loss), blitz off the 
edge (seven quarterback hurries and 3.5 sacks) and drop back in coverage (four pass breakups, which led UF linebackers).His nonstop motor and knack 
for ﬁ  nding the football makes the 
defensive line’s job easier, which 
makes the secondary’s job easier, which ultimately makes the de-fense as ﬁ  erce as it is.
Plus, with the Gators riddled 
with inexperience at lineback-er, Davis provides a mentor for Florida’s underclassmen at the position, ensuring that once he 
leaves, the group will pick up 
right where it left off.
Davis didn’t have to come 
back this year. His resume from 
the last two seasons would have 
been enough to get him drafted into the NFL.
But following the Gators’ beat 
down in the SEC Championship 
Game by Alabama last year, he 
wanted to come back and ﬁ  nish his UF career on a high note.
“I can’t say enough about him 
as far as what he brings to the Gators,” UF coach Jim McElwain told reporters last week.
Don’t worry, coach. You don’t 
have to say anything.
Jarrad Davis will let his play 
speak for itself.
PINAK: Jalen Tabor
Likely the next great ﬁ  rst-
round cornerback out of Florida, 
Jalen Tabor will undoubtedly be the Gators’ MVP this season. 
The reason? UF’s stiﬂ  ing defensive line will 
slow opponents’ run games, forc-ing them to throw the ball. 
Cue Tabor. 
And really, all Tabor has to do 
is put up similar numbers to his 
2015 season. He picked off four passes last year and broke up an-
other 14 en route to a ﬁ  rst team 
All-SEC selection. 
Vernon Hargreaves III, the 
11th overall pick in this year’s NFL draft, notched the same amount of interceptions but broke up just four passes last sea-
son. With Hargreaves out of the 
picture, the limelight-loving Ta-bor should shine. 
The only way Tabor might not 
be Florida’s MVP is if his outspo-ken and ﬁ  ery personality gets in his way. The junior is suspended for UF’s season opener against Massachusetts after engaging in 
an in-practice scufﬂ  e with team-
mate C’yontai Lewis, which car-ried over on Twitter in a number of subtweets between the two. 
Tabor was also suspended for last 
year’s matchup with Tennessee. 
Regardless, Tabor’s ability to 
shut down opposing wide receiv-ers will have too great of an im-
pact in the games he does play to 
not deem him the team’s MVP.

ida’s MVP? Vote online at alliga-tor.org/sports.
