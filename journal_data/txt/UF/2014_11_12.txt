A group of U.S. veterans and family 
members picked up their paintbrushes 
Tuesday afternoon in a colorful celebra-tion of the men and women who served.
Army veteran Greg Revels and Ma-
rine Corps veteran Jacob Dodd sat in front of their “amber waves of grain” American ﬂ  ag paintings, swapping war stories at Painting with a Twist’s Veter-ans Day painting class.
Dodd painted a black and gold army 
star on Revels’ arm, and Revels painted Dodd’s black Marine Corps emblem tat-too as part of a tattoo challenge halfway through the event.
“I was in Germany when the Cold War ended,” Revels told Dodd.
“Oh, really?” Dodd responded, his 
interest peaking.
Revels was in the Army for 2 ½ years, 
ending his service in air defense in 1992. Dodd served from 2005 to 2009 as an ord-nance technician working with bombs and artillery. It was the ﬁ  rst time either VOLUME 109 ISSUE 56 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2014

The Sun Center in downtown Gainesville will be 
the new home for Sababa, a Jewish-Israeli cafe.
The falafel cafe residing at UF Hillel will have its 
grand opening in downtown on Feb. 1.
Rabbi Adam Grossman, UF Hillel’s CEO, said he is 
sad to see the cafe go after serving customers at Hillel 
for about two years but is excited for its expansion.
“UF Hillel and Sababa have had a great relation-
ship over the years,” Grossman wrote in an email.
Grossman said he hopes Sababa will be able to 
bring the taste of Israel to more people with its expan-sion.  
“We wish them all the best as they continue to 
grow,” he said.
The general manager of Sababa, Riley Sullivan, 
said they decided to move in hopes of attracting more customers.
“We weren’t getting quite the foot trafﬁ  c and at-
tention that we were hoping for,” Sullivan said.
The restaurant offers a wide variety of Mediter-
ranean and Kosher food, as well as vegetarian and vegan options.
Yael Goldstein, the co-owner of Sababa, said she 
hopes to bring an array of healthy food to downtown Gainesville.
“A lot of people say that they feel like they are 
home when they come in,” Goldstein said. “We have the whole Jewish-Israeli experience.”  Falafel cafe

After The JAM announced its closing, the 
rumor mill spiked with concerns that a block-
wide buyout was imminent near downtown.
The Florida Innovation Hub at UF owns 
the 800 block on West University Avenue, 
where the music venue and several other local 
businesses are located.The area is slated for Innovation Square, a 
40-acre research and innovation community complete with businesses, residences, retail and hotel space meant to connect UF with downtown Gainesville.
Still, the area is years from construction, 
said Ed Poppell, director of economic devel-opment for Innovation Square.
“We have a long-term redevelopment plan,” Poppell said. “We told all of the tenants months and months ago that we would give them adequate notice when we thought that would be imminent.”
Lilli Wiggins, owner of Uniﬁ  ed Training 
Center at 809 W. University Ave., said the fear 
that the area’s other tenants would be kicked out after The JAM’s closing is unfounded.
“I think what happens is it becomes a fear 
factor,” Wiggins said. “I don’t personally think 
it’s going to happen anytime soon.”
Wiggins, who is the biggest renter of the 
block, said they all went in knowing the area would one day be demolished.
But Eddie Arenas, owner of The JAM, said 
the developers of Innovation Square did not provide him with a lot of information on the construction plans.Innovation Hub buyout still up in the air, tenants starting to worry

He said his leases became 
shorter and shorter until he 
was open on a month-to-month lease that threatened closing at any time.
“Trying to stop what is in 
motion is kind of futile,” Are-nas said.
He said he has considered 
reinventing the spot to make any stay in the area more proﬁ  t-able, but as it is now, The JAM’s lack of proﬁ  t and the imminent construction justiﬁ  ed the deci-
sion to close.
“We are in limbo, where we 
can’t make any improvements 
to the business, and the busi-ness model as it is right now cannot make enough revenue to keep up the music venue,” Arenas said. “But we are not getting kicked out.”
Poppell said a deal for the 
area is nearly signed. If it goes through, the new developer could start building as early as summer 2015.
“We don’t have a signed 
deal,” Poppell said. “Until it’s done, it’s up in the air.”
Wiggins and Arenas said 
their major concern is the loss of a home built in 1890s that sits on the block, but Poppell said the home has been condemned due to safety issues.
“I hope that whoever does 
develop it realizes how special at least our space is,” she said. “We will be knocked down, ab-
solutely one day we will. But it 
is going to be really sad when it does.”JAM owner had a

What happened in Key West didn’t stay 
in Key West for one sea turtle now recov-
ering from a herpes-like virus.
Shelly Krueger, a Florida Sea Grant 
agent who works with the UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Exten-sion ofﬁ  ce in Monroe County, said she was 
leading a group of students in the Florida 
Keys when they spotted the sea turtle suf-fering from a type of herpes that is usually contracted in warm water.
“We knew he had the ﬁ  bropapilloma-tosis virus because it’s common in sea turtles that are stranded,” she said. “We knew when we saw tumors over the eyes, it would only get worse.”
Krueger, along with the help of ﬁ  ve stu-
dents, brought the turtle onboard of their boat.
It was minutes later that the turtle was 
riding along in a turtle ambulance to the Turtle Hospital in Marathon, Florida.
IFAS, named after the UF research facil-
ity, underwent his surgery Friday and is still in recovery from the life-threatening 
disease, which can cause blindness.“IFAS had a really strong heartbeat,” 
Krueger said. “They’ve removed the tu-
mors from his eyes, and he’s still got some on his neck that they plan to remove.”
Krueger said she hopes to raise enough 
money to place a tracking system on IFAS to see how he fares once he is released back into the Keys.
Although they haven’t begun to plan how to secure the money, Krueger said they still have a year, as IFAS will remain in the hospital for turtle rehab.
Kelly O’Hara, a UF wildlife ecology 
and conservation sophomore, said she’s concerned for IFAS.
“In the past few years, we’ve seen 
animals develop weird ailments, and it’s 
probably due to human activity and pol-
lution,” the 20-year-old said. “I think in the long run, we need to take better care of our surroundings because that’s what these animals call home.”

Students would need a big sandal to swat 
at the insects that ruled 400 million years ago. 
UF worked with more than 100 researchers 
from around the world to discover that insects 
were among the first inhabitants to rule the land in a prehistoric time, according to a study released Friday.
Researchers reconstructed the insect tree 
of life by examining roughly 144 species and DNA sequences, including 1,500 genes, result-ing in date estimates of origin and relation-ships between all major insect categories.
Akito Kawahara, co-author of the study 
published in the Science Magazine, wrote in 
an email that although insects constitute more 
than 1 million described species on the planet, very little is known about how the groups are related.
“A ‘tree of life’ for insects is the first step 
in understanding more about insects,” Kawa-hara said. “Without this firm understanding, it is hard to develop pesticides, medicines, help pollinators, etc.”
Mason Russo, a UF entomology sopho-more, said past insect populations were known to be a lot bigger due to oxygen levels.
“Oxygen levels have decreased, so it makes 
sense that there were more millions of years ago,” the 20-year-old said.
The study is researchers’ best estimate, 
based on molecular DNA and fossils, Kawa-hara said. The study also found that the diver-sification of insects is related to the evolution of winged species.   
“It was a major international effort by re-
searchers across disciplines,” Kawahara said.Study: Insects first to inhabit land 400 million years ago

A naked man had to be dragged out of an apartment early 
Tuesday after police said he pushed and grabbed his wife.
Shortly before 5 a.m., 36-year-old Daryl Brown and his 
wife got into an argument while in bed at their home, located 
at 4016 SW 22nd Road. According to an arrest report, Brown grabbed both of the woman’s arms, which caused bruising, and then he pushed her.
When police arrived, they said the woman seemed scared 
of Brown and was hesitant to tell officers what happened.
She later told police Brown was hiding in a closet. He 
emerged from the closet fully naked and was handcuffed.
It took four officers to get Brown out of the apartment and 
into a patrol car.
He was arrested on charges of battery, disturbing the 
peace and resisting an officer with violence. His bond is set at $30,000.

Earlier in the day, officers responded to a

Around 6 p.m. — minutes after police left 
— Braswell called again and said a neighbor shot at her while she was sleeping. When officers arrived, no evidence of a gun being fired was found.

A new social media app lets you 
do more than connect with people 
— it lets you buy them a drink.
It’s On Me, created by UF gradu-
ates Luke McGurrin, 23, and Wayne 
Ferguson, 28, is a new app that al-
lows users to send and receive drink and food specials from their favorite 
bar or restaurant. 
McGurrin described the app as a 
mashup of Tinder, Instagram, Snap-
chat and a rewards program. It al-lows people to log in via Facebook and send a drink to other users who are checked in at the same bar, and  the recipient can then either accept or deny the drink within a 20-min-
ute time frame. If accepted, McGur-
rin said the app matches the users in a conversation so they can establish where they are in the venue.
Both 101 Cantina and The Swamp 
are hosting launch parties tonight for the app from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
UF civil engineering senior Jona-
than Daguilh said apps like Tinder and It’s On Me have changed the 
way people connect.

NYT report reveals 
extent of Bondi’s 
corruption
Last week, Florida voters re-elected Attorney General Pam 
Bondi in a landslide. Bondi received 55 percent of the vote, while her Democratic challenger, George Sheldon, 
received 42 percent.
Bondi has had a number of controversies surface during her 
time in ofﬁ  ce. Most notably, Bondi ensured that a scheduled ex-ecution would be moved so she would be able to attend a politi-cal fundraiser.
Despite Bondi’s troubling track record during her ﬁ  rst term, 
her success in portraying herself as tough on crime, particular-ly in the areas of drug abuse and human trafﬁ  cking, led to an easy re-election. Bondi was helped by an anemic, poorly funded Sheldon campaign that truthfully never stood a chance against Bondi’s well-oiled political machine.
Bondi’s re-election campaign received massive contributions 
from the Republican Attorneys General Association, an organi-zation that seeks to elect and support Republican attorney gen-erals across the country. RAGA is heavily funded by secretive dark-money groups, which are supported by corporations, giant political action committees and conservative mega-donors.
Just a few days after Bondi’s re-election, The New York Times 
published a damning report about Bondi’s relationship with a high-proﬁ  le corporate lobbyist whose ﬁ  rm donated $35,000 to 
RAGA.
Last year, Bondi took a free ride on a private jet to a resort 
island, courtesy of Washington lobbying ﬁ  rm Dickstein Sha-
piro. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Shapiro “specializes in building personal relationships with state attorneys general to help corporate clients avoid becoming targets of investigation.”
After the plane ride, Bondi extended an offer to Dickstein 
Shapiro lobbyist Lori Kalani to stay at her Tampa home while Kalani recovered from surgery.
During Bondi’s ﬁ  rst term, Dickstein Shapiro contacted Bon-
di’s ofﬁ  ce on behalf of a number of corporate clients, including pharmaceutical giant Pﬁ  zer and for-proﬁ  t college giant Bridge-point Education. However, the ﬁ  rm is not registered to lobby in the state of Florida, suggesting that Dickstein Shapiro employees may have committed serious violations of Florida ethics laws.
For Florida voters who were unaware of the implications 
of re-electing Bondi to another four-year term, the report from The New York Times makes Bondi’s values and priorities abun-
dantly clear. Our attorney general has no desire to protect the 
interests of Floridians or to uphold our state’s constitution. Her main priority is to ensure that the large corporations and lob-bying ﬁ  rms that provide her with campaign donations and free trips avoid any legal consequences for their behavior.
Unfortunately, it is too late for Florida voters to rectify their 
error in allowing Pam Bondi an additional four years to trans-form the Ofﬁ  ce of the Attorney General into a hotbed of corrup-tion and bribery.
Hopefully, Floridians will take a stronger stand against cor-
porate inﬂ  uence in state government in 2018.Compassion, not indifference, helps poor
Last week, 90-year-old Arnold Abbott made headlines worldwide after he was arrested for feeding the home-less in a public park in Fort Lauderdale. The arrest 
occurred just days after a new city ordinance took effect, making it more difﬁ  cult for private citizens and charitable 
organizations to feed the homeless in public.
Abbott, known affectionately as “Chef Arnold,” has been 
feeding the homeless gourmet meals for decades through his 
nonproﬁ  t, Love Thy Neighbor. Unfortunately, the city’s new restrictive measures severely limit his ability to continue giv-ing meals to the hungry. His organization will now be re-quired to provide portable toilets for both the workers and the people receiving meals. Feeding sites have to be more than 500 feet away from each other and from residential 
properties, and only one site is allowed per city block.
If he does not comply with the rules, he will face hun-
dreds of dollars in ﬁ  nes and up to two months in jail.
Abbott’s arrest reﬂ  ects a troubling and growing trend. 
More and more cities are enacting laws that try to ﬁ  x home-
lessness by ignoring it. According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, the number of cities that introduced re-strictive food sharing legislation has increased by 47 percent since 2010. Some communities are making it illegal for peo-
ple to leave their personal items on public property, sleep on 
public property or solicit at busy intersections.
Many homeless advocates across the nation have vehe-
mently protested these measures because outlawing the ways homeless people try to survive will not solve the issue of homelessness. Additionally, these laws support the harm-ful idea that homeless people are simply an inconvenience that must be dealt with, which may explain why some cities have spent thousands of dollars to buy the homeless one-
way bus tickets out of town.
Surprisingly, however, some homeless rights activists 
have defended Fort Lauderdale’s new laws.
Ron Book, chairman of the Miami-Dade County Home-
less Trust, spoke out in favor of the city’s public feeding 
ordinance. He argued that feeding people on the streets is “counterproductive and inconsistent” with efforts to reduce homelessness.Book’s intentions are noble, 
but enforcing laws that criminal-ize acts of kindness is not a solu-tion to homelessness. These laws unwisely assume that preventing 
public feedings will encourage the 
homeless to improve their situa-tions, but they essentially allow city ofﬁ  cials to ignore the problem. The homeless will still be living on the streets at the end of the day — just hungrier than usual.
Admittedly, homelessness is a complicated issue. Sub-
stance abuse and mental illness are signiﬁ  cant factors that 
contribute to homelessness, and they are not easy to ad-
dress. However, instead of passing restrictive ordinances in the hopes that the homeless population will disappear, city ofﬁ  cials should work with advocates to create real, sustain-able solutions to the issue. Local governments would beneﬁ  t immensely from collaborating with nonproﬁ  ts and charities. Abbott’s nonproﬁ  t, for instance, takes on a variety of tasks in order to reduce homelessness. According to Love Thy Neighbor’s website, the organization works to “provide 
shelter, healthcare, education, clothing, food” and even a cu-
linary skills training program for the homeless.
Though these initiatives would be costly for a city to un-
dertake, they directly impact the problem of homelessness. Investing in housing assistance, drug and alcohol treatments, job training and other outreach programs will give homeless people the tools they need to start supporting themselves and become contributing members of society.
Abbott, kind and determined in his crisp chef’s uniform, 
is an example to all of us. City governments should follow his lead and try to provide help for those who need it, in-stead of creating policies that make it more difﬁ  cult to per-form generous acts.
Laws are supposed to protect members of society from 
harm. Compassion can do that, too.

Voters did not reject Obama’s agenda 
A recent opinion column in this newspa-
per claimed that voters this month “vehe-
mently rejected Obama’s agenda.” Howev-
er, this could not be further from the truth. As much as some would like, a simple na-tional narrative cannot be derived from this 
election. While it is true that the GOP had an overall victory, it had little to do with a supposedly unpopular presidential agenda. 
Despite personal ratings, President Barack Obama’s agenda itself remains popular and has had important victories. Voters in deep 
red Arkansas, Alaska, Nebraska and South 
Dakota voted overwhelmingly to support 
raising minimum wage. In Washington, a strong majority of voters chose to enact 
strict background checks on gun sales. The 
GOP’s Senate wave can be attributed simply to a favorable map: Senate elections were held mostly in red states, where increased 
partisan sorting made it highly unlikely for 
Democratic incumbents to hold their seats. 
This year’s midterm elections looked very similar to those that occurred in other presi-
dents’ sixth year in ofﬁ  ce. Political observers 
love to jump to conclusions after elections. This year, however, the best conclusion is that there is none.

Letters to the Editor
Grab anyone’s smartphone, and you’re likely to ﬁ  nd an app like Google Maps that can provide explicit instructions 
to reach destinations throughout the world. There was a time when acquiring directions was more difﬁ  cult, requiring maps and com-passes. If only the ease of Google Maps could translate into directions for our nation’s fu-ture. Despite how easy it is to ﬁ  nd our way to the nearest coffee shop, movie theater or our long lost aunt’s house, we, as a nation, are aimless, directionless and seemingly lost. Yes, that’s a dour procla-mation, and maybe it’s easy to be morose after just 36 per-cent of eligible voters cast ballots in last week’s midterm election, but perhaps it’s time we ask ourselves where we, as a nation, would like to go. It’s too early to tell whether a Republican-led Congress will ﬁ  nd compromise with President Barack Obama, but if gridlock remains in place, it’s time for us all to do a little soul searching and perhaps consult a map for our nation’s future.
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy told the American 
people that by the end of the decade, an American would be on the moon, and he was. It’s a trite example that elicits audible groans from the pessimists in the crowd, but if it worked in the awfully turbulent 1960s, why can’t we ﬁ  nd some direction in 2014?
Our leaders and institutions seemingly skate from one 
crisis to the next without any bold vision for our country’s future other than fearing the debt, fearing the terrorists, fearing Ebola, fearing the opposing political party and fearing that long-lost aunt. Fear is not a recipe for direc-tion, and generally, if you’re lost in the woods, fear is not a prescribed method for ﬁ  nding your way to safety.
It’s not clear whether the American people — well, the 
ones who actually voted last week — chose a speciﬁ  c di-rection for the nation’s future, other than asking Washing-ton to end the gridlock that has all but paralyzed the gov-ernment. That’s not necessarily a clear vision for the future of our country, but it’s past time for us to ﬁ  nd out where we as a nation are headed. 
Leaders in Washington and throughout 
the country need to echo Kennedy’s spirit and actually stand for something bold, vi-sionary and unifying. Whether that’s return-ing to space, revolutionizing our nation’s infrastructure or something still unknown to the general public, American leaders have an obligation to actually lead. 
All of this sounds rather naive, and perhaps it is, but 
part of our country’s strength lies in our naivete. No mat-ter how big, bold or difﬁ  cult the challenge, the American people rise up and accomplish greatness. The spirit that guided a generation through the Great Depression, past two world wars and onto the surface of the moon is re-placed by cynicism, anger, doubt and distrust. 
Some speculate that millennials largely avoided voting 
last week because we have no faith in American institu-tions, especially politics and the government. While that might be true, it’s going to take bold action on the part of generations young and old to restore faith or reform the institutions that allowed our country to thrive for more than two centuries. 
The great conundrums that block our path forward are 
where we would like to go and how to get there. As young people, we are often told to create a ﬁ  ve- or even a 10-year plan. The roadmap of our lives gets adjusted along the way, but if we largely stick to that plan, we are seemingly more likely to succeed. It seems rational, and it probably is. We receive this advice for a reason.  
If it works for us personally, perhaps it’s time for us, as 
the American people, to ﬁ  gure out our ﬁ  ve- and 10-year plans. Otherwise, we might spend the future living in our parents’ basements, and it’s doubtful anyone wants to be a British colony again.

Does Usain Bolt train without timing himself? 
Do Gators endure the whole semester with-out checking their grades? Then why does 
the Student Recreation & Fitness Center deprive gym goers of a scale?
By my second week of college, I decided to work 
out habitually. The very ﬁ  rst thing I did when I ar-
rived at the Student Recreation & Fitness Center was 
search for a scale to test the “freshman 15” theory. After several workouts that ended with me aimlessly wandering around, I approached two employees and asked where the scale was. The employees, seem-
ingly embarrassed, told me that the facility does not 
have a scale because its philosophy is to promote stu-dent health, not obsessive weighing.
The lack of a scale may appear to be a trivial con-
cern, but it’s actually the product of a much greater health-related issue: America’s fear of being con-fronted with the cold, hard truth.
A large portion of Americans support the farci-
cal claim that scales are detrimental to health-related 
progress. Their theory, as I’ve heard from countless 
friends, is that magnifying and obsessing over one simple element of your overall health is painfully anxiety inducing. This is true. In fact, a student pop-
ulation of weigh-aholics is the last thing we need, but 
the beneﬁ  ts of having a scale available greatly out-weigh the drawbacks (pun intended).
A scale can really wake you up with a painful jab 
to the gut, or in my case, the belly. However, it can 
also pour you a shot of motivation with a chunk of 
get-it-together, Jell-O.
Scales instigate change. Whether you’re 2 pounds 
underweight or half a pound over, dissatisfaction en-
courages a course of action. That’s exactly what we 
need in the gym: a blunt dose of reality that keeps us hufﬁ  ng and pufﬁ  ng on the StairMaster for a few more minutes.
Furthermore, scales provide invaluable hints 
about our overall health. Researchers have recently determined that being overweight is closing in on smoking for being the leading factor of early death. Clearly, weight should not be ignored. If we continue 
to minimize the applicability of weight as an accurate 
depiction of overall health, however, we are setting ourselves up for a much ruder awakening. The jab of a few pounds gained cannot be nearly as startling as the jab of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease or 
cancer.
Finally, as humans striving for progress, we can-
not turn our heads to setbacks and live in ignorant 
bliss. That promotes stagnation or even regression. 
We need the truth. We need to be able to measure 
quantiﬁ  able progress. And, even if it’s limited to a few times a week or surrounded by anti-obsessive weighing posters, we need a scale.

attended a painting class aimed 
at supporting veterans.
It was a first for Gaines-
ville’s Painting with a Twist, too, which was one of 100 par-
ticipating studios nationwide 
that donated a portion of its proceeds to the Special Opera-tions Warrior Foundation.
Fifty percent of the proceeds 
from the store’s event, which charged a $35 fee to its nine at-tendees, was donated to the or-ganization.
Dodd was accompanied by 
his wife, brother-in-law and mother. He said it was refresh-ing to see an event aimed solely at veterans.
“There isn’t a whole lot of 
actual functions that go up for them,” Dodd, 29, said. “Most of them are just selling apparel 
and gear or something like 
that.”
The event featured a guided 
painting class of an American flag, food and wine, trivia and a tattoo competition.
“If you’re talking about a 
veteran function with alcohol and food, you can get veterans to come,” Dodd said, laughing. “That’s a fact.”
Sharon Quackenbush also 
attended the event with parents Richard and Ginny in support of the studio’s donation to the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.
“I think it’s a fabulous way 
to incorporate a lot of differ-ent talents and interests be-cause this is a modern activity,” Quackenbush said. “It’s kind of neat to see the combination of modern tied with veteran expe-riences.”
Chance Cummings, Dodd’s 
brother-in-law, said participat-ing in veteran events is a small price to pay for their service.
“They put it on the line for 
us, (people) need to start doing something for them,” he said.
As the paintings received 
their last touches, Quackenbush added a small farm to her grain 
field, Cummings initialed his 
with a “CC” and Dodd added a Marine Corps emblem.
Most painters got up to ad-
mire their work, while Dodd stayed behind. Red capital let-ters were just visible inside the red stripe of his flag: “SGT DODD.”8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2014
VETERANS DAY
ALYSSA FISHER
Alligator Staff Writer afisher@alligator.org
Moving out of his childhood 
home, Alan Ferry found a stack of 
airplane drawings.
From early doodles to joining 
the U.S. Air Force to majoring in aerospace engineering at UF, Ferry said he has always been drawn to planes.
Before coming to UF last Spring 
to study aerospace engineering, Fer-ry, 27, was a senior airman in the U.S. armed forces, working as an aircraft mechanic on the C-5 Galaxy aircraft in the Middle East and Kyrgyzstan, 
he said.
“When I first joined, it was a com-
bination of things,” Ferry said. “One 
of the big things was getting the op-portunity to serve my country. Sec-ondary to that was the educational benefits.”
Ferry began serving in Janu-
ary 2009, and during a two-week 
break in September, he married his 
wife, Catherine. She pushed him to continue his education after he was discharged in January 2013, and he said there was no doubt about leav-ing their Northern Virginia home to move south. Born in Jacksonville, Ferry said he is a Gator.
“I was born bleeding orange and 
blue,” he said. “I went to my first football game at 9 (years old). I had to go here.”
Connecting with people in 
Gainesville wasn’t as easy as it was in the military.
“The people I really connect with 
are people who were in the mili-tary,” he said. “I don’t know what it 
is, but it just seems like there’s a spe-
cial type of person that goes there. I fit that bill, and we all seem to get along.”
Before coming to UF, Ferry at-
tended Santa Fe College. He went to school, worked and came home. During his first week at UF, it looked like it would be the same.
But one day, someone spotted 
his military backpack as he was leaving physics class and gave him directions to the Collegiate Veterans Society at UF. Now, he can be found in the Collegiate Veterans Success Center in Yon Hall every day.
“It goes back to the people,” he 
said. “You can have a conversation with anyone about anything. Every-one has done different things — has different stories but similar. We can all relate.”
In between classes and work-
ing at the UF Hurricane Research Laboratory on east campus, he goes 
to Yon Hall to eat lunch, watch TV 
and study. He and his friends in the society also tailgate for Gator games, play poker and road trip to away games together, he said.
For his first Veterans Day as a 
member of the society on Tuesday, he volunteered at VETSPACE, a lo-cal nonprofit, to help homeless vets.
“It’s a different perspective to 
meet veterans in a tougher place, suffering post-traumatic stress dis-order  or sustained injuries — men-tal or physical from their service.” Ferry said. “Being able to help them 
means a lot — veteran to veteran.”
On most Veterans Days, he 
spends a quiet day with his wife. A 
lot of people don’t know the sacrific-es veterans and their families have made, so he said he cherishes the holiday for making people aware.
“I get a lot of thank yous, and it 
makes me feel proud,” he said.
Collegiate Veterans Society presi-
dent Marcus Tucker, 29, acknowl-edged Ferry as a great, well-round-ed guy.
“He’s very involved, and he’s 
in one of the tougher majors,” said Tucker, a UF marketing senior. “The club is better with him in it.”
Ferry said the tough classes will 
be worth it, as he hopes to join the engineering teams of companies like Lockheed Martin or Boeing and put together planes. He also thinks a lot about going back to the military to become a pilot. He said if the oppor-tunity came up, he couldn’t say no.
“As a veteran, I would like to say 
thanks,” he said. “Go, Gators.”

Among the many Veterans 
Day celebrations Tues-

public and free to active and re-tired military personnel. Those in attendance enjoyed a drill 
team demonstration, ﬂ  ag and 
wreath-laying ceremony and 
musical tributes. Children and 
teenagers from both the Milton Lewis Young Marines and the 
Billy Mitchell Drill Team par-
ticipated in the services.

UF soccer prepares for 
the NCAA Tournament by using its departure from the SEC Tourney. Read the story on page 14Lacrosse releases schedule
The UF lacrosse team released its 2015 schedule on Monday. In its ﬁ  rst season in the Big East Conference, the Gators will play four top-10 teams.Holston honored by SEC
Florida right-side hitter Alex Holston was named the Co-Southeastern Conference Offensive Player of the Week on Monday after recording a season-high .600 hitting percentage against Alabama on Friday.There isn’t much you could say to criticize women’s 
basketball that hasn’t already been said. The players have heard it all. 
The points people 
make, they have valid-
ity. Women aren’t as ath-
letic as men, and therefore the game of basketball isn’t as exciting when played by women.
It’s a boring, incorrect argument, 
and I’m tired of hearing it.
Sure, women can’t dunk a bas-
ketball. I hate to be a downer, but no one on the Florida Gators women’s basketball team is going to rise above the rim and throw the ball through 
the hoop. It’s only been done by sev-
en women in the NCAA – most re-cently by Baylor star Brittney Griner in 2013. So the odds are pretty low that any of the Gators will dunk. 
The tallest player, redshirt ju-nior Viktorija Dimaite, stands at a solid 6-foot-4, a signiﬁ  cant few inches shorter than the 6-foot-8 Griner. And with a left 
knee that’s undergone 
two ACL reconstruc-tions, it’s doubtful that Dimaite can even get up high enough to dunk, let 
alone while running full-speed in a game.
In its original iteration, basketball 
inventor James Naismith developed 
the sport with strategy in mind. 
There were no dunks, no alley-oops, and Naismith required the ball to be passed to be moved down the court. There was no dribbling or blocking of the basketball – each team had equal opportunity to move the bas-ketball down the court through a series of strategic passes and com-
munication.
If you want to see high-ﬂ  ying 
dunks, a fast paced game, and out-standing athleticism, then go to a 
Harlem Globe Trotters game.
But at 3:15 p.m. on Friday, the 
Florida’s women’s basketball team takes on Jacksonville, providing 
their own take on the sport that 
has changed the lives of millions. This form of basketball relies upon team chemistry, dynamic passing, and moving the basketball to create space.
These elements have countlessly 
proven to be the most crucial in de-veloping an effective women’s bas-
ketball team. While it’s true that bas-
ketball is faster at each succeeding level, women’s basketball requires mostly memorization of plays and offensive sets along with increased conditioning, as these are the most common ways to score once you ne-gate above-the-rim athleticism from their version of the game. 
The most noticeable difference 
between the two sports? The degree RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Staff Writer @RagjUF
It is often said that around 90 percent of 
an iceberg’s mass is below the surface.
The same can be said of Florida’s sea-
son so far. 
Despite everything the team has gone 
through publicly, many goals still remain 
attainable. 
After two victories 
against Georgia and Vanderbilt, the hope is that the corner is 
turned for UF, that everything from here 
shows sevens and that things outside of 
their control fall into place. 
If they do, the Gators could be in Atlan-
ta for the Southeastern Conference Cham-
pionship game.
And with exceptional play, Florida 
could also register a victory over a con-
sensus College Football Playoff entrant in Florida State.
Former starting quarterback Jeff Driskel 
said the last two victories have been vindi-cating, after a rash of negativity following an embarrassing performance against Mis-
souri.
“Yeah, there was a lot of negative press 
going around our program. That’s some-thing you have to deal with playing at a 
big program like the University of Florida. I don’t think we let it get to us,” Driskel said. “We didn’t read much into it, we just kept doing what we were doing. I think we

◗ THE FORMER STARTING 
QUARTERBACK PLAYS A WILDCAT-TYPE ROLE.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer
@J_McPherson1126
Jeff Driskel’s role on Flor-
ida’s offense changed in the 
blink of an eye.
One day, the redshirt ju-
nior was the starting quar-terback, the leader of the Gators’ attacking force.
Then, with less than six 
minutes left in the third quar-ter of Florida’s 42-13 loss to Missouri on Oct. 18, he was on the bench in favor of true 
freshman Treon Harris.
Since that day, Harris has 
led Florida’s offense to two 
straight wins against then-
No. 11 Georgia and Vander-
bilt.
Driskel knows his role 
on the team, and he admits the transition hasn’t been 
smooth.
But while his role has 
changed, his preparation for 
Saturdays has not.
“It’s been tough,” Driskel 
said. “I’m not going to say it hasn’t been difﬁ  cult. But at Jeff Driskel embraces

Nobody likes to lose. 
For Florida, it has taken last week’s 
loss in its first match of the Southeastern 
Conference Tournament and turned it into 
a positive as it heads into Sunday’s first round of the NCAA Tournament.
The Gators headed home from the SEC 
Tournament earlier than expected after dropping their first game to Tennessee in penalty kicks. But, as multiple members of the team have said, that loss may have been a blessing in disguise.
“I think dropping out early was good 
for us actually,” senior Lauren Silver said. “Having this whole time off, we get to mentally get engaged in the game. And 
now we get to practice this week and put 
the physical part of it into play and then hopefully all of that will add up in the Mercer game.”
Florida received a No. 2 seed on Mon-
day for the NCAA Tournament and will host the Mercer Bears on Sunday in its first-round match. The Gators are excited to have received the No. 2 seed and are 
happy to once again be playing on their 
home field. 
“We’re really, really excited to be play-
ing at home,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “It gives us a couple extra days, too, so I 
think from that standpoint, it’s given us a 
chance to really kind of hunker down on some of the things we want to work on.”
The unsettling realization now for Flor-
ida is that one loss in the NCAA Tourna-ment means its season is over.
Losing in the SEC Tournament didn’t 
provide that big of a blow to the team be-cause it knew there was still soccer left to be played. That will no longer be the case after this tournament.
With that in mind, the Gators are fo-
cused on preparing well and showcasing a strong performance on Sunday, which they hope will be just the beginning of a deep run into the tournament.
Florida cannot afford to assume that its 
match against Mercer will be easy by any 
means. 
The Bears won their conference cham-
pionship and set a school single-season 
record with 14 wins this year.
“I think we just have to trust ourselves, trust our system, trust each other and just trust our coaches,” senior Annie Speese said. 
“Everything that we’ve been working 
on up to this point, just make sure it all comes together.”
Florida’s seniors also recognize that 
their collegiate careers are rapidly coming 
to a close. With the NCAA Tournament lying ahead, Silver isn’t focusing on just 
winning, but also on enjoying her time on the field.
“This year, I developed a lot of rela-
tionships with people on the team and I’m pretty much playing for the people next to me,” Silver said. “It’s good to be on the field and to have a purpose, rather than 
just winning.”

Lauren Silver dribbles the ball during Florida’s 3-1 win against Tennessee on Oct. 24 at James G. Pressly Stadium. The Gators 
earned a No. 2 seed in the 2014 NCAA Tournament and will host Mercer on Sunday.
SoccerUF using early departure from SEC Tourney to prepare for NCAA’sof athleticism between men’s play-
ers and between women’s players features a much smaller margin of difference for the women. 
This means that most players of 
the same height typically have iden-tical degrees of quickness and speed. Often, the only way around a player is to run the play effectively and effi-ciently, leaving little room for error. 
Women don’t have the advan-
tage of being able to use their ath-leticism if a play breaks down – they just have to draw up a new one.
This method of essentially “on 
the fly” play calling makes a wom-en’s basketball guard more similar to a football quarterback than any other sport. If a team has identified your play, the guard essentially must audible into another play to try 
and break down the team’s defense.
While it seems like a more 
stripped-down version of basket-
ball, that analysis is a lazy general-ization. 
The offense in women’s bas-
ketball is almost entirely reliant on plays, and often the original play doesn’t work the first time. If you 
can’t develop a new play or move 
the ball to get a shooter open, you most likely will run back down the court empty-handed.
When it comes to developing an 
efficient basketball offense, women have to be quicker than men.It would be belittling and down-
right sexist of me to infer that men’s basketball players are slower intel-ligently than women’s basketball 
players. I’m not trying to position 
one gender as better than the other, in either way. I’m just damn tired of hearing people call women’s basket-ball “boring” or “slow.” 
It’s not – it’s a strategic game 
played at court level, entirely reli-ant on communication and strategy. Akin to chess or tennis, the sport re-
quires you to outwit and out match 
your opponent on a more balanced court than the men play on. 
And that doesn’t sound boring to 
me at all. 
It sounds absolutely enthralling.the end of the day I’m still doing 
what I’ve always done. I’m still pre-
paring to be ready to go in and make plays if my number gets called. That’s what I owe this team.”
Driskel’s number was called on 
Saturday during the Gators’ 34-10 win against the Commodores.
The former starter was used in a 
wildcat-type package on five occa-
sions during the win in Nashville, 
Tennessee, accruing 10 rushing yards on four attempts and an in-completion.
On his third rushing attempt of 
the night, Driskel put the Gators in the lead for good with a 1-yard rushing touchdown with 8:38 re-maining in the first half.
“I knew when it was short-yard-
age stuff, have my helmet ready,” Driskel said.
Driskel is embracing his role 
change from starter to mentor.
He knows the skill Harris pos-
sesses, but he still feels he can help the freshman become even better.
“In practice, there’s some things 
where sometimes we’re not all set 
or not on the same page,” Driskel 
said. “Just some simple communi-cation things, especially in practice when we have two-minute offense going. There’s some situations he 
hasn’t been in as often as I have. 
There’s just little tips. I’m not going out of my way to try to take over or anything like this. It’s just simple 
tips and reminders on the practice 
field and on the sideline.”
Driskel is ready for his new role.But he’s still preparing like he 
always has.
“At the end of the day it’s a team 
sport and everybody has to con-tribute and do their part,” Driskel said. “If mine’s the backup and not 
getting any plays at all I want to be 
ready in case Treon goes down. If it’s being in a Wildcat type role, I want to be ready and able to run the ball and understand the block-
ing schemes and the defense we’re 
going to get.”
were preparing well, even 
before the bye week. We just continued staying the course 
and made plays in these past 
two games as a team.”
Florida is gunning for a 
third victory in a row this 
weekend against South Caro-
lina, with a plan to “take back The Swamp” against former Gators coach Steve Spurrier, the man that coined the nick-
name for the stadium.
Current coach Will Mus-
champ has taken an extra 
step beyond preaching home 
field advantage though. To 
promote a fast start for the noon kickoff the grounds crew painted “12:01” in the north endzone of the Flor-ida’s practice field, to keep 
the game time in their minds 
every time they score.
“It’s just kind of a remind-
er it’s an early game it’s an 
early turnaround after meet-
ing in the hotel,” cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III said. “He does it a lot, it’s not the 
first time he’s done it, we un-
derstand we’ve gotta get go-ing early.
“It’s the same thing as any 
other team. Every game’s important you gotta try to win out especially us, we dropped a few in the begin-ning we felt like we could get 
back but other than that we 
just gotta win out.”
Although the mission is 
still to win out, they’re tak-
ing it one game at a time, fo-
cusing on the next opponent. South Carolina is fifth in the conference in pass attempts and second in average yards 
gained through the air. 
The Gamecocks are also 
fifth in total offense and are 
led by quarterback Dylan Thompson, who averages 
the second most yards pass-
ing per game in the SEC.
“He’s a great player, he 
can make plays,” Hargreaves said. “Throwing the ball he 
has great receivers, it’s al-
ways tough to stop a good quarterback.”
If Florida can’t prove up 
to the task of stopping the Gamecocks, a season will be sunk and Florida’s iceberg will have to endure a cold 
offseason up ahead.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

It’s difficult to recall the first 
point of any match, let alone one 
played nearly eight weeks ago.
But players will remember 
the first meeting between Florida and Auburn not because the final 
score was close, but because the first three minutes were.
The first set opened with a 
rally that seemed endless to coach 
Mary Wise, as it lasted far longer 
than any point this season and gave the Gators a glimpse at the 
competitive level of the remain-der of the match.
Only one game above .500 and 
facing the Southeastern Confer-
ence’s premier team at home, Au-
burn did not roll over.
“They earned our respect,” 
Wise said.
Auburn challenged Florida 
despite losing in a sweep, scoring 14, 19 and 19 points in three sets 
against the Gators.
Now, two months improved 
and playing on its home court, No. 7 Florida (19-3, 13-0 South-eastern Conference) will look to 
conjure a repeat of its last perfor-mance against Auburn (11-14, 3-9 
SEC) when the Tigers visit tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
Riding a 14-match win streak, 
Florida feels like it has a good chance.
“We try not to think too much 
about the past, whatever many 
games we’ve won in a row,” se-nior Holly Pole said. 
“We come in to practice every-
day and we try to get better. That 
even if we won two SEC games 
the weekend before, it’s not how 
much we beat a team by or if we 
won in three sets, it’s whether or 
not we got better from the day be-
fore.”
Florida’s improvement is pal-
pable.
In its first match against Au-
burn, Florida was ranked fourth 
in the SEC in hitting efficiency (.271), 10th in opponent hitting 
efficiency (.197), ninth in blocks 
(2.34/set) and third in service aces 
(1.37/set).
Now, those statistics read first 
(.312), first (.158), second (2.42/
set) and first (1.66/set), respec-
tively.
“We’ve said it every week,” 
Wise said. “Our goal is just to be 
a better Gator team than we were last weekend.”
It’s a familiar cliché, but as the 
Gators have shown, an effective one if adhered to.Florida has made it its mantra.
“That’s our number one focus,” 
Pole said.
While the Tigers shouldn’t 
present much of an issue, espe-
cially on the road against a vastly improved Florida front row and 
experienced back row, the Gators are using their conference match-es to sharpen their own skills and 
habits.
“I think right now,” sopho-
more Alex Holston said, “there’s 
always room for improvement in 
every aspect of our game.”16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2014

Time is ticking for the men 
and women’s Florida cross 
country teams as the NCAA Regional meet quickly ap-proaches. 
The women and men have 
struggled in their last few out-ings, finishing tenth and sev-enth at the 2014 Southeastern Conference Championships, respectively.  
UF coach Paul Spangler 
knows the teams will have to run their best races this season 
if they want to advance past 
this weeks regional meet in Tallahassee. 
“We’re going to need to 
have a good performance as we compete for one of two spots for the NCAA Champi-onship,” Spangler said. “On the women’s side, same thing 
we’re going to have to com-
pete for two spots.”
One thing the men’s team 
has been missing this season is senior presence. 
With both senior standouts 
Jimmy Clark and Eddie Garcia redshirted, Spangler and the rest of the team have had to 
fill the leadership void. 
“Having those guys (Jimmy 
and Eddie) out there on a con-
sistent basis helps out a lot,” Spangler said. “Those guys are phenomenal teammates and leaders and I think not having them out there has af-fected the team a little bit. But 
as we move forward both of 
those gentlemen are compet-ing in track and they’ll both be back next year alongside the rest of the team.”
If the season were to wind 
down this weekend with a third place or worse finish for the men, the team can look for-ward with confidence in 2015. 
The future is bright for the 
Gators as young stars will lead the way for the team at this Friday’s Regional meet. All-SEC Freshman Thomas How-ell has had previous success at the course the team will run this week. 
“That’s where I won my 
first state championship in high school,” Howell said. “I am very familiar with the course. But of course this time it is a 10K instead of a 5K. I am looking forward to it, I love that course and I miss that course. I’ve done some big things there and hopefully I 
can do it again in the coming 
weeks.” 
Heading into SEC’s, Span-
gler made the decision to hold the teams back in training. Now that the team has had two weeks to prepare for the Regional meet, the regimen has changed again.
“What I’ve found looking 
back on the training, we’ve got a guys and girls who want to work hard,” Spangler said. “Sometimes there is a tenden-cy to overwork them. That’s something I have got to do a better job of, not pushing them over the edge.”
The women will be led by 
freshman Lauren Brasure and sophomore Taylor Tubbs, who have headed the team all sea-son. Brasure was sick at SEC’s and had one of her slowest races to date. Improvement is key
