Water droplets fell from the trees 
as the red team discussed its strat-
egy. 
“Who’s the fastest runner?” 
someone yelled. “Are you posi-
tioned right? I’m gonna cover you,” 
someone else said.
After a few minutes, the referee 
yelled, “Go, go, go!”
A few moments of silence passed, then the woods ﬁ  lled with the auto-mated sound effects of gun shots as the two teams tried to capture each other’s ﬂ  ag. After about 15 minutes, 
the referee declared the game over. 
The red team was defeated miser-
ably, but in spite of the loss, the play-
ers had no marks, welts or bruises indicating where they were shot. 
 The reason: They were playing 
laser tag. These players, as well as their opponents, were some of the ﬁ  rst to play at M2 Battlesports’ new 
location at the Easton Newberry 
Sports Complex at 24880 NW 16th Ave., which opened for public ses-sions on Saturday. M2 Battlesports’ original location is in Waldo.
For $18, a player receives up to 
two hours of playing time on the 
17-acre pine forest playing ﬁ  eld — 
complete with barricades, bunkers and blackberry bushes. Owner Rich-ard Dreher said he also plans to in-stall lighting in the future for night games.     
There are a wide variety of gun 
choices; all shoot accurately for 1,200 feet — which are detected by 
sensors worn on headbands — but 
some shoot at a faster rate, while VOLUME 108 ISSUE 160 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, JULY 15, 2014

In one day, ﬁ  ve separate women offered 
an undercover Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cer a 
total of $150 worth of sexual acts.
GPD arrested the women during an op-
eration to crack down on Gainesville’s pros-titution problem, which occurred on July 9 from about 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
“The reason for details is citizen com-
plaints and evidence of prostitution in cer-tain areas,” GPD spokesman Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
But the prostitution issue isn’t new to 
Gainesville. 
Last November, GPD arrested ﬁ  ve peo-
ple in a similar undercover sweep, accord-ing to Alligator archives. Another under-cover operation occurred last month, which resulted in four arrests, according to the June 27 police brief.    
“We conduct these details as often as 
we can when we observe the criminal ac-tivity rising,” he said. “We are usually able to conduct anywhere from three to 10 per year.” For this operation, ofﬁ  cers used un-
marked vehicles ﬁ  tted with communication devices to later record the conversations with the arrested women, according to the 
police report. 
“The details are usually dictated by 
crime statistics,” Tobias said. “There are 
ofﬁ  cers in charge of the details, and a full support staff available to the (undercover) 
ofﬁ  cer.” 
Ofﬁ  cers found Crystal Lashay Cook, 
23, on Bo Diddley Plaza where she entered 
the undercover ofﬁ  cer’s car and offered to give him oral sex for $30, according to the report.
On the report, she was listed as a stu-
dent, but UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes conﬁ  rmed she is not a current student at 
UF. 
Around noon, the same ofﬁ  cer noticed 
46-year-old Dawn Dawson Putnam on the 
2100 block of Southwest 13th Street where she entered the undercover vehicle and of-
fered to give oral sex for $30, according to 
the report.

Gainesville Police recently 
connected 41-year-old Dan-
ny Williams of Gainesville to 
multiple sexual assault cases 
where he had taken advan-tage of women in the Tent City area. 
GPD charged Williams 
with sexual assault with a weapon after he knocked a woman to the ground, choked her until she passed out and 
raped her near the 500 block 
of Northwest Eighth  Avenue last Tuesday, according to a police report. 
Witnesses heard the wom-
an’s screams for help when she woke up, which made Williams run from the area. 
Williams stated that the 
woman tried to rob him with a knife, according to the re-port. 
He did not further explain 
why the knife was found near him
“Danny Williams has 
been positively identiﬁ  ed by victims in three cases, and 
we are fairly certain he is responsible for a fourth, but 
the victim did not get a good enough look at him,” GPD spokesman Ben Tobias wrote 
in an email. 
“Williams was armed with 
a knife (that we recovered) 
in all of the attacks,” Tobias 
said. “We believe there may 
be possibly more victims that may have not reported their attacks.” 
Ofﬁ  cers booked Williams 
into the Alachua County Jail last Tuesday at about 8 p.m. As of press time, his bond is set at $5,000,000. 
Anyone who has been 
victimized by Williams is en-couraged to contact GPD de-tectives at 352-393-7658. Man accused of

When Titi Le decided to 
join the Gainesville restau-
rant scene, she wanted to 
recreate her experiences with 
European cafe culture but with a personal touch.
“I wanted a relaxing ambi-
ance,” Le said. “A European flare with an Asian twist.”
Le opened TiTi’s Café this 
July, a few stores down from Bagels & Noodles and across 
the street from Thrift 5.
TiTi’s is open from 7 a.m. 
to midnight. The cafe features 
freshly made smoothies, cof-
fee, sandwiches, gelato and 
bubble tea and is catered to-ward a healthy atmosphere, which is important to Le.
“Your mood changes,” 
said Kate Hobson, 21, a man-ager at TiTi’s Café. “The more healthy you eat, the better you feel all the time.” 
Hobson frequently ventures 
onto West University Av-enue to offer smoothie sam-
ples to pedestrians to intro-
duce them to the cafe.
Le said she wanted to in-
troduce healthy smoothies, drinks and European gelato 
to the UF students who fre-
quently walk by the cafe on the way to class.
At TiTi’s, a small cup of 
coffee runs at $1.40, and a smoothie can range from $5.75 to $6.75. A small gelato is $4.25, a medium is $5.25 and a large is $6.25. 
Bubble tea is $4 for a small 
and $5 for a large.
Le said she researched 
different ways to prepare her menu items before she 
opened the cafe.
“If I didn’t feel it was the 
best that I’ve tasted, then 
I wouldn’t have put it in 
there,” she said.
She plans to extend her 
operating hours until 2 a.m. during exam weeks to attract 
students to study at the cafe. 
Le wants to create a study-
friendly environment and of-
fers Wi-Fi with purchase of a 
menu item.
Kevin Bowie, a 21-year-
old UF student studying po-litical science and econom-
ics, went to TiTi’s for the first 
time on Monday and ordered a strawberry bubble tea.
“It seems like it would be 
a really good place to study and work,” he said.

from Vietnam, has been in the Gainesville area for 35 
years.

CRIME
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LAS VEGAS — Eight people 
from Malaysia, China and Hong 
Kong were accused on Monday of operating a temporary, illegal gambling ring from exclusive 
high-roller villas at a Las Vegas 
Strip resort that investigators said logged millions of dollars in bets on FIFA World Cup soccer games.
Wei Seng Phua, 50, a suspected 
organized crime member, and the others were named in a criminal complaint detailing the scheme to 
take bets over Wi-Fi and DSL lines 
they had casino employees install in their suites at Caesars Palace.
During their arraignment, a 
federal judge granted a request that Phua and his son, a co-defen-dant, stay with a Las Vegas doc-tor and poker enthusiast while awaiting an Aug. 4 preliminary hearing.
Phua must post $2 million cash 
bail, wear a GPS monitoring de-vice and put up his $48 million 
private Gulfstream jet as collat-
eral, among other conditions.
Phua’s lawyer, David Chesnoff, 
argued in court that his client has the means to leave the country but has cooperated with authorities since a Wednesday raid.
“He had access to an aircraft 
that can fly anywhere in the 
world,” Chesnoff said of Phua, 
who has an estimated worth of as much as $400 million. “In fact, he stayed here.”
FBI and Nevada Gaming Con-
trol Board agents made the arrests Sunday after raids on Wednesday in three Caesars suites. Agents re-ported finding a laptop computer logging illegal wagers and other records.
The criminal complaint noted 
that at least some transactions in 
Las Vegas appeared to have been 
conducted over a website called “SBOBET.”
Phua is from Malaysia. Bogden 
identified him as a high-ranking member of 14K Triad, an orga-nized crime group.
Bogden said that if convicted, 
each could face up to two years 
in federal prison on an unlaw-
ful transmission count and up to five years in prison on an illegal gambling business count, as well as fines on each count of up to $250,000.

The entire M2 Battlesports set-up can also be transported 
others inﬂ  ict more damage. Dreher is cur-
rently working on a laser tag version of a .50 caliber machine gun for future use.
“The best part of the job is playing with the toys,” Dreher said.
The entire M2 Battlesports package can 
also be transported and set up at a private ses-sion. Dreher said there was even a game held in front of Library West at UF last winter.
Peyton Agliata, a 16-year-old from High 
Springs, said one of the best parts of playing at M2 Battlesports is there isn’t any pain in-volved, as opposed to paintball or airsoft.
“I like it because you don’t get hit, obvi-
ously, but you get the same adrenaline rush,” she said.
Rich Hibner, a 31-year-old Gainesville resi-
dent, said laser tag is appealing to a broader range of people because it’s intense enough for adults and college students but young chil-dren and families can still play.
“Young kids can play because they don’t 
have to worry about getting hit,” Hibner said. “But then again, it can also be appealing to the enthusiast.”

Fulford offered to give “head” in 
exchange for $20 but would only get 
a part of the money because she me-
diated with Lisa Barlow, 47, for the 
exchange, according to the report. 
Ofﬁ  cers found Cheryl Davis, 49, loitering in the area near the 1000 block of Southeast Fourth Avenue where she got in the undercover car 
and offered to give oral and vaginal 
sex to the ofﬁ  cer for $50, according to Thursday’s police brief by Tobias.

When Central Florida Ofﬁ  ce 
Plus shut down after being in busi-
ness for 56 years, it left more than 
just an empty store.
The local ofﬁ  ce and art supply 
store, which closed its doors for good on June 24 due to insufﬁ  cient funding, left a hole in the art com-
munity because it was the only place many art aﬁ  cionados shopped. 
“It’s like McDonald’s running 
out of their meat source,” said Rob-
ert Mueller, a UF associate profes-
sor specializing in printmaking. 
Mueller said the art department 
will have to rethink how it gets ma-
terials now.
The whole reason for having a 
local art store was as a safeguard for 
running out of supplies, he said.
“No one can predict how much 
of everything you need,” Mueller said. 
Clara Aziz, a 19-year-old UF art 
sophomore with a specialization in 
sculpture, said it is inconvenient for 
the store to close.
She said sometimes teachers 
would tell them they needed ink and they needed it by tomorrow.
“Sometimes teachers will have 
you get stuff at the last minute, but then you don’t have time to order something and have it shipped,” she said. Aziz said the bigger stores are 
not as good and they are over-priced. She said she feels like 
Gainesville doesn’t care that much 
about art.
“We feel neglected,” Aziz said. 
“Where are we supposed to get our 
materials?”
Ben Ingle, a 25-year-old UF art 
senior specializing in painting, said 
he has been a customer since draw-
ing became his hobby at 5 years 
old.
“I’ve been shopping there since 
they’ve been open,” he said. “I was shocked when they closed. I thought 
they were doing amazing.”
Ingle said it was convenient that 
he didn’t have to pay extra for ex-
pedited shipping or wait a week for 
something to arrive when he was 
working on a project. 
He said he has a lot of materials 
since he has been painting for so long, but he feels bad for the other 
students. 
Alex Velasquez, a 21-year-old 
UF architecture junior, said the 
store was the only place that had 
all the professional tools he needed 
for drawing and art. He said he was heartbroken when it closed and that it was more than just a store. 
“I felt like they were really tied to 
the community,” Velasquez said.
He said it often displayed ﬂ  i-
ers for different events, such as the Spring Arts Festival. 
It was the place to go, not just for 
students, but for local artists, too. 
“It affects everybody in the com-
munity,” Mueller said. 
He said it’s hard to order ﬁ  ve 
sheets of paper from a vendor in 
New York because the company 
won’t do it. 
Vendors like when people buy 
in bulk, and the school can do that 
but some local artists can’t afford 
to, he said. 
Hopefully people will see this as 
a big niche to ﬁ  ll, Mueller said. 
“A city this size that doesn’t have 
an art materials store and yet has the size of our art department and the requirements for what we need is really cutting off the wellspring 
of making the work,” Mueller said. 
“We make things. If we don’t have the materials to make things, its kind of hard to make them.” 
For former customers, all that’s 
left to do is wait.
“Hopefully someone opens up 
an art store,” said Ingle. “Say you need something in a pinch, where 
are you going to go? It’s massively 
inconvenient that there’s not a good art store in Gainesville anymore.”Art supply store closure leaves void

Daylight and clouds limited visibility, but 
observers from North Carolina to New Jersey still had a shot at seeing the rising Antares rocket.
Its destination, the space station, was soar-
ing 260 miles above Australia when the Cyg-nus took ﬂ  ight. The unmanned capsule should arrive there Wednesday.
This newest Cygnus 
contains more than 3,000 pounds of supplies, much of it food. Also on board: mini-satellites, science samples, 
equipment a nd experimen-tal exercise clothes. NASA 
said the new type of cloth-
ing is resistant to bacteria and odor buildup. 
So the astronauts won’t smell as much during their two hours of daily workout in orbit, and they’ll require fewer clothing changes.
NASA hired two companies — the Vir-
ginia-based Orbital Sciences and California’s SpaceX — to keep the space station well-stocked once the shuttle program ended. 
The Cygnus will remain at the space sta-
tion for about a month. It will be ﬁ  lled with 
trash and cut loose for a ﬁ  ery re-entry. Unlike 
the SpaceX Dragon capsule, the Cygnus is not built to return safely to Earth. Space station shipment of food, clothes launched from Virginia“It’s like McDonald’s

University of Miami 
sells forest land, 
soul to Wal-Mart
It’s easy to forget, what with daily strange Gawker headlines 
and a certain highly anticipated magical theme park open-ing, that Florida wildlife is in danger. From rising sea levels 
threatening the southern coast to black bears ransacking neigh-borhood trash as a result of overdevelopment to Big Oil drilling 
in the Everglades, Florida’s natural resources are under attack. 
The reasons for the continued raping of our state’s natural 
resources are the same: greed, commercial interest and lack of 
accountability. 
The latest offense comes from the land of excess itself: Mi-
ami. The University of Miami this week sold about 88 acres of rockland, a “globally imperiled habitat containing a menagerie of plants, animals and insects found no place else,” for the devel-opment of a Wal-Mart, according to the Miami Herald.  
“You wonder how things end up being endangered? This is 
how,” attorney Dennis Olle, a board member of Tropical Audu-bon and the North American Butterﬂ  y Association, told the Her-ald. 
Olle blamed bad policy. The culprit responsible for the the in-
coming shopping center, which is slated to include an LA Fitness and a Chili’s, is a Palm Beach County developer who pledges to set aside 40 acres for a preserve. 
However, this simply isn’t enough. The rockland is home to 
a number of delicate native plants and endangered species, in-cluding the bald eagle, indigo snake and Florida bonneted bat, which was placed under federal protection last year. 
When the project was proposed in 2011, the Herald reported, 
a federal ordinance stipulated that biologists may examine the land to rescue plants prior to development. When wildlife orga-nizations began picking through the proposed development site, they discovered a “trove of rare plants” in addition to two types of rare butterﬂ  ies — one species that’s expected to be named an 
endangered species this summer and another that almost went 
extinct in the 20th century. 
Though federal ofﬁ  cials say they plan to watch the project 
carefully, their hands are tied when it comes to what they can and can’t enforce. Since federal property or money is not in-volved and no endangered animals are being killed (yet), there’s little they can do. County ofﬁ  cials are similarly limited in what kind of action they can take to protect this rare Florida land. 
This fresh act of violence on endangered land comes at an 
especially sensitive time. A 2002 study by the Institute for Re-gional Conservation found that “only 23 percent of native plants are now considered safe,” the Herald reported. About 40 species that grow only in the pine rocklands will be displaced upon the arrival of the Wal-Mart and other corporate chains.
We’re not saying that Wal-Mart, LA Fitness and Chilli’s 
aren’t wonderful modern conveniences — who doesn’t want to stock up on cheap s**t, work out on a treadmill surrounded by dozens of other sweaty people, and gorge on ﬂ  ash-frozen faux-
Mexican food? But these modern conveniences shouldn’t come 
at the sacriﬁ  ce of invaluable natural resources. The walk of shame — minus the shame
It’s 8:37 a.m. when you wake up and look around, 
thinking, “Wait, that Southern Tide poster isn’t mine. 
Whose room is this?” 
You roll over to see a maybe-stranger pressed up 
against you — and judging by what’s pressed against your back, he’s happy to see you.
Congratulations. From what it looks like, you got 
lucky last night. Hopefully, the sex was good because now you have to make your way across campus from his 
room to your own.
I lived on campus my freshman year, so any adult 
sleepovers I had required me to do a walk of shame. My 
ﬁ  rst one is still the most memorable.
I walked from Lakeside Complex to Hume Hall — 
barefoot, because my shoes had broken the night before — in a men’s T-shirt and boxers. My hair was wet and 
tangled from the post-shack shower, my face was make-
upless, except for the smudged mascara under my eyes, 
and my breath still smelled like whiskey.
It was the most stereotypical walk of shame to ever 
happen. It would have been bearable, except that it hap-
pened to be game day, which meant I had to walk past crowds of tailgating families.
The judgmental glares from parents of small children 
were fun, but walking past Fraternity Row and getting 
catcalls and high-ﬁ  ves from our esteemed alumni really 
made the experience worth it.
So, welcome to a new class of young and impression-
able freshmen — I can’t wait to see you stumbling down Stadium Road in last night’s clothes. Here are some 
words I can offer you to make your walk of shame a little less shameful than mine was:
First of all, no amount of advice is going to make it 
seem like you’re not on a walk of shame. All I can do is try to make your post-coitus morning more tolerable.
If you have plans to shack, try to dress accordingly the 
night before. That might require forgoing 5-inch heels 
and wearing an outﬁ  t that looks good in the dark at Mid-town and in the daylight on the North Lawn.If you can’t ﬁ  nd your clothes, 
(or you really just don’t want to wear that leopard-print mini-skirt at 9 a.m.) borrow a shirt. 
We’ll still know exactly what 
you did — and your shirt will 
likely tell us which fraternity 
you did it with — but at least you’ll be comfortable. 
Don’t even bother trying 
to downplay a themed outﬁ  t. Wearing a button down 
and boxers a la “Risky Business” early in the morning 
screams either, “I had sex last night,” or “I blacked out and passed out on a random couch.”
At least these outﬁ  ts are entertaining for those who 
didn’t get lucky the night before. 
To rid your breath of that “My night was ﬁ  lled with 
watered-down beer and sweaty body parts” smell, I 
recommend stocking up on some Listerine PocketPaks. 
Gum and mints work ﬁ  ne too, but the Listerine strips are 
the best substitute I’ve found for actually brushing your 
teeth.
Strategically plan your exit time, as well. Pay atten-
tion to class times and leave accordingly. For example, class ends at 9:20 a.m. and starts at 9:35 a.m., so that 15 
minutes in between is a high-trafﬁ  c window. 
Wait to leave the comfort and nonjudgmental safety 
of the bedroom until the middle of class. That way, there 
will be fewer people around to see.
And most importantly, don’t take crap from anyone. 
Inevitably, a random passerby is going to glare, or smirk, 
or — my personal favorite — slow clap.
Don’t pay them any mind. Just because it’s called a 
walk of shame doesn’t mean you have to be ashamed. After all, they probably fell asleep on the couch, watch-
ing Netﬂ  ix, and you got laid last night.

In “The Odyssey,” Odysseus must 
avoid the mythical sirens who lure sailors to their doom on the rocky 
shoreline of their island. Though the 
songstresses are enticing, Odysseus 
and his crew, with the assistance of 
some beeswax with which they ﬁ  lled their ears, force themselves to ignore the dangerous distraction in order to 
preserve their best interest.
The Republican Party has a few sirens of its own: 
Namely, the impeachment-happy Sarah Palin and 
the conservative ﬁ  lm-provocateur-turned-conspir-acy-theorist, Dinesh D’Souza. These inﬂ  uential 
leaders of the populist wing of the conservative 
movement are leading the GOP to its doom. 
Palin, who has only grown more inﬂ  uential 
with conservatives because of her nutty antics, 
entered into the political arena, yet again, to call 
for President Obama’s impeachment. This is po-
litically unfeasible, and yet this move helps Palin’s 
brand. The more outlandish, unhinged and con-troversial the former governor is, the more entic-ing she becomes. 
The reason for this allurement is because the 
“lame-stream media” continuously attacks her. When conservatives see one of their own besieged in such a way, they swoosh into the fray to protect her — not because of her opinions, but because she 
is “one of us.”
As a result, some members of GOP are an in-
direct proponent of Palin’s impeachment prom-
ises. Forget the fact that this was a tried-and-failed strategy of the 1990s, when Republicans tried in vain to oust Bill Clinton; most Americans show no interest in impeaching the president and have no desire to relive the process. 
This distraction has gone on for far too long, 
and it’s time that Republicans discard Palin and her kin. 
Her approach to communicate a conservative 
message is intellectually dishonest and can only be described as a pathetic attempt to galvanize an already galvanized populist conservative base. 
But that is the only strength Palin has. She ex-
cels in memorizing select, hot-button buzzwords that are guaranteed to gain attention. Take the im-peachment article in question: “Opening our bor-ders to a ﬂ  ood of illegal immigrants is deliberate. This is his fundamental transformation of Ameri-ca. It’s the only promise (Obama) has kept.” No in-depth policy knowledge 
was expressed in this article. No ad-vice that should be taken seriously. No use to conservatives. 
D’Souza is noted for directing 
“2016: Obama’s America” and his most recent piece, “America.” The controversy that now surrounds D’Souza deals with his gripe with 
Costco. Prior to the release of ﬁ  lm 
“America,” an accompanied book was sold in 
Costco. Due to lackluster sales, the wholesaler pulled the book after a month. Then came the ﬁ  re-and-brimstone movie and all of the fervor that is 
associated with it, and national sales of the book 
increased. 
Instead of realizing that an agent of the free 
market made a business decision — Costco pulling 
a book it felt was not selling as much as it should 
— D’Souza went into conspiracy overdrive. 
Connections between the Costco CEO and the 
Obama campaign were made.  Clips of the presi-
dent touting Costco’s higher-than-national mini-mum wage (mind you, a high minimum wage 
reached without governmental edict) were shown. 
Dots that should not have been connected were 
linked. 
As with Palin, when this conservative comes 
under ﬁ  re, the base rallies around its own. And like 
Palin, D’Souza’s narcissistic move does not help 
the larger political movement. You have to hand 
it to these two political entrepreneurs: They have marketed and maintained their brand image with great effectiveness, albeit at expense to common-sense conservatives. But this should not surprise anyone. This is what happens to a political move-ment that wishes not to govern. The brands of Pa-lin and D’Souza would be hurt if that occurred. 
There must always be the “enemy” that is to be 
confronted and fought: Palin attacks Obama and D’Souza goes after Costco. And with any great enemy comes the great victim, and conservatives have two great faux victims that need constant at-tention and protection of their own. 
In the end, Palin and D’Souza may not be the 
sirens luring conservative ships to the rocky coast — they are captains actively steering the ships to run aground.

The situation in 
Palestine that has taken place 
over the past four weeks has brought us to speak out against the unjust collective punishment being levied on the Palestinians by the state of Israel. 
The justiﬁ  cation for the bomb-
ing of Gaza and the raids in He-bron and other sites in the West Bank this time is the kidnapping and now death of three teenage Israeli settlers. Any loss of life should be mourned, and while our hearts break for the fami-lies of the three teenagers, they also break for the 1,384 Palestin-ian children killed by the Israeli military since 2000, according to the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. 
That’s one child killed every 
three to four days for the past 14 years. Major media outlets like CNN, NPR and others have failed to report on the Palestinian loss of life, painting a slanted nar-rative that values Jewish Israeli lives over Palestinians. 
Since the boys went missing 
on June 12, 10 Palestinians have died either by the hands of the Is-rael Defense Forces or right-wing extremist settlers. The most recent was Mohammed Abu Khdeir, who was found burned alive. Also troubling are the 34 missiles that fell on Gaza in one night, which should be condemned, as it is a use of collective punish-ment with no concrete proof on who conducted the killings.
The violence being inﬂ  icted by 
the Israeli government is not an isolated or rare occurrence, but rather an intensiﬁ  cation of the daily enforcement of the Israeli occupation, which is maintained by oppressive means. Israeli leaders’ calls for revenge have es-
calated racist attacks on Palestin-ians. In the last few days alone, hundreds of right-wing Jews ri-oted in the streets of Jerusalem, chanting “Death to the Arabs” and “We want war.” 
Groups searched for random 
Palestinians on the street, even forcing their way into a McDon-alds in an attempt to assault Pales-tinian workers. Others burst into commuter trains while, accord-ing to the Israeli paper Ha’aretz, “Light rail security guards stood next to Palestinian passengers to protect them from the mob.”
Prime Minister Netanyahu’s 
repeated calls for vengeance in 
the form of collective punishment 
of Palestinian civilians, including mass arrests, killings and even missile drops on Gaza, should trouble any person who believes in due process of law. Terroriz-ing an innocent population will neither bring justice nor make ei-ther Israeli or Palestinian children safe.
We must recognize the fact 
that Palestinians are facing a con-stant occupation, which in itself is violent, and facing the worst effects of settler colonialism. Do not forget that the two “sides” are asymmetrical. Collective pun-ishment is never justiﬁ  ed and hopefully some day we come to recognize that Palestinian lives do matter.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Rodeo 
cowboy Frank Koloski has been gored 
before, but never at an event he spon-sored.
The founder and co-owner of Ro-
deo Alaska  was promoting and par-ticipating in the Alaska Sales & Service Bear Paw Rodeo Round-Up and took a steer horn to the abdomen on Satur-day.
“I have a nice little hole in me,” he 
said Monday from his hospital bed.
Originally from St. Cloud, Florida, 
Koloski’s specialty is “double mug-
ging,” an event in which one cowboy 
on a horse ropes a steer while another on foot tries to wrestle the animal to the ground, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Koloski was the cowboy on foot Saturday night.
“It was just pretty wild,” he said. 
“When I went to take him down, I felt him hit me.”
He also saw blood on his shirt. The 
bull’s horn had punctured him below his stomach and pushed in about 4 1/2 inches, he said. He tried to “kind of trot” out of the arena but got light-headed and fell.
He took a ride to Providence Alaska 
Medical Center for surgery. His doctor spotted a scar on his leg where he had been gored before. Koloski managed to win the double-mugging event de-spite the wound and was awarded $1,000 and a belt buckle.
He expects to be released from the 
hospital Monday or Tuesday, he said. He plans to heal in time to participate in 
upcoming rodeos: the Aug. 1-2 Tanana 
Valley State Fair in Fairbanks, Alaska, which he believes is the farthest north rodeo in the country, and the “Tough Enough to Wear Pink” rodeo Sept. 5-6 in Anchorage, which raises money for breast cancer awareness.
He may pass on double mugging.“I should be OK to do team rop-
ing,” he said.Alaskan bull gores cowboyLOCAL

Balance 180 kicked off its 
second summer camp on Mon-
day.
With the focus of integrating 
all athletes of varying abilities 
into the world of sports, Bal-
ance 180 is one of few inclusive summer camps in the Alachua County area, which means that children of varying abilities and needs are welcome.  
The camp runs through Aug. 
1 at the gym at 6527 NW 18th Drive and takes place Monday 
through Friday, with athletes 
ranging from 2 to 15 years old.  
Administrative coordinator 
Julie Foster said gymnastics is not only physical exercise, it helps develop social skills and listening skills, and teaches children to take turns.
“We really want to encour-
age our campers to be physi-cally active and healthy,” Fos-ter said.Foster works behind the 
scenes and coordinates the lo-gistics of the camp, such as any ﬁ  eld trips that it might take.
A regular day at camp in-
cludes an hour of gymnastics instruction and activities such as crafting, games and special guest appearances.
Volunteer coordinator Sha-
ron Medina said fulﬁ  lling the camp’s projected ratio of two volunteers per camper won’t 
be an issue because there are 
more than 60 volunteers this summer. 
“We ﬁ  rst recruit at the Uni-
versity of Florida because it’s one of our biggest networks for volunteers,” Medina said.
This summer, Balance 180 expects more than 75 athletes to attend the summer program. 
The campers require consis-
tency from volunteers, which means recruiting over the sum-mer can be more challenging in comparison to Fall and Spring semesters because of conﬂ  ict-ing schedules, Medina said.
Nancy Vallejo, a 21-year-old 
UF communication sciences and disorders senior, said her experience at Balance 180 last year was invaluable.
“I was able to apply the 
knowledge I accumulated from class and invest in the lives of those in the Gainesville com-
munity,” Vallejo said.
Balance 180 provides plenty 
of opportunities for locals and 
college students to get involved aside from its summer camp. 
During Fall and Spring 
semesters, it has an adaptive gymnastics program and a Spe-cial Olympics young athletes 
program that is always looking 
for volunteers. Camp helps kids stay active  
“We really want to 
encourage our campers 
to be physically active 
and healthy.”

Doctor Who?

�THE SURVEY USED 2012 DATA.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — What you study seems 
to matter more than whether your alma mater 
is public or private when it comes to finding a high-paying job after college.
A report released by the National Center 
for Education Statistics found that overall, col-lege graduates reported lower unemployment rates compared with the national average, although black and Asian college graduates were twice as likely to be out of work than their white classmates. College graduates from private four-year 
schools earned about the same as those from public four-year schools, about $50,000 a year.
Although a paltry 16 percent of students 
took home degrees in STEM disciplines, those who did were paid significantly better — av-
eraging $65,000 a year compared with $49,500 
of graduates of other degrees.
The findings are based on a survey of 
17,110 students conducted in 2012, about four years after the students obtained their bach-elor’s degrees.
The survey found a strong correlation be-
tween earning money and highly specialized degrees. More than 95 percent of graduates who studied computer and information sci-ences, for example, were employed full time at the time of the survey and earned $72,600 on average.  
Engineering students reported similar job 
and salary prospects. That’s compared with 
a humanities graduate who was more likely 
to report working multiple jobs and earned a full-time salary averaging only $43,100.
C.N. Le, a sociologist at the University of 
Massachusetts at Amherst, said Asian stu-dents are gravitating toward career fields in STEM disciplines that are initially higher pay-ing, which likely explains the higher average salaries by Asian graduates. But they might be facing the higher unemployment rates — al-most 12 percent compared with 5.5 percent of white graduates — because of visa issues or policies by American businesses favoring U.S. citizens. Le said there also is a “glass-ceiling ef-fect” in the STEM fields. 
Black college graduates faced a similar un-
employment rate of almost 12 percent, while 8.5 percent of Hispanic graduates were out of work, according to the survey. 
“The Great Recession has been hard on all 
recent college graduates, but it has been even harder on black recent graduates,” concluded the Center for Economic and Policy Research in a study it released last May.

FRUITLAND PARK, Fla. 
— Two police officers are no 
longer with the city department here after a law enforcement re-port tied them to the Ku Klux 
Klan, an official said Monday.
Deputy Chief David Borst 
resigned, and Officer George 
Hunnewell was fired last week, City Manager Gary La Venia said.
The link surfaced in a report 
from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement based on in-
formation from the FBI, which 
learned about the connection during a broader investigation, La Venia said. 
Florida Department of Law 
Enforcement spokeswom-an Gretl Plessinger said she couldn’t say what was in the 
report since it is “active intel-
ligence.”
The State Attorney’s Office 
told city officials that pending cases from the officers will be reviewed, although Borst’s job was primarily administrative and didn’t involve much pa-trolling, La Venia said.
The city of 5,000 residents is 
located about 40 miles north-west of Orlando. 
Fruitland Park was once 
known for its citrus groves and is in Lake County, where KKK violence in the 1940s and 1950s was chronicled in the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, “Devil in the Grove.”
La Venia said residents were 
surprised. “This city is diverse, 
tolerant. It’s a welcoming com-
munity,” he said.Two police officers

After Justin Jackrel, president of citECar Electric Vehicles, 
challenged his employees in June to create an electric car that 
could reach 75 miles per charge, his staff created a product that reached 40 miles beyond his expectations.
On July 2, citEcar announced that its newest street-legal golf 
cart, the 6PR XLC, could reach 105 miles on only one charge.
“We’ve been working on a combination system of an up-
graded battery pack, a more efficient and upgraded motor and solar panels that are made in the USA,” Jackrel said.
He said citEcar produced the 6PR XLC in response to cus-tomer demand for a vehicle with a longer range.
Clients interested in the vehicle usually need to taxi their 
customers for long periods of time, Jackrel said. The 6PR XLC 
can reach up to 25 mph and seats six people.
“The true secret to it was the addition of the solar panel,” 
said Jeff Hawkins, production manager for citEcar.
Hawkins, who helped create the 6PR XLC after Jackrel asked his team to create it, said it only took four hours to construct.
When an employee drove the 6PR XLC around in June to 
test the vehicle, Hawkins said it showed no sign of slowing down past his initial plan to reach 75 miles per charge.
“It would have ran all day until the sun went down,” he 
said.
The addition of the solar panel attracted Traci Walker, presi-
dent of Canyon Zip Line in Ocala, to consider the product. She 
said she’s hoping to get a 6PR XLC that can seat eight people when one becomes available.
“Our carts are always out in the sun so it would work out 
great for us,” she said.Street-legal electric vehicle charges up beyond expectations

For most students, the ability 
to rent textbooks instead of buy-
ing them saves quite a bit of cash. 
But for bookstores, that doesn’t al-
ways translate into more profits.
Lynne Vaughan, UF Book-
stores director, said it depends on how many times the rented book 
goes through circulation.
“We have to rent that book 
three or four times before we make what we would on a bought 
textbook,” she said.
In UF’s three bookstores, there 
are about 1,500 titles available for 
rent, she said.
In UF’s fiscal year, running April through March, UF rented out 28,000 textbooks.
Vaughan said more students 
tend to buy books than rent.
Erin Gray, a 19-year-old UF po-
litical science sophomore, said she doesn’t have a preference.
“The only thing I buy are books 
for my major,” she said.
Gray said she never sells back the books she buys, so renting is 
usually the option that saves her 
the most money.
Mike Lammers, store manager 
of the Florida Bookstore at 1614 
W. University Ave., said he al-
ways encourages students to rent.
Last Fall, Lammers said, the 
Florida Bookstore helped students save more than a quarter of a mil-
lion dollars by renting instead of 
buying.
“There’s quite an algorithm 
that goes into pricing a rental,” he said.
Most books lent out are priced 
below the cost the bookstore 
bought them for.    
Matt Kuizon, a 21-year-old UF 
physiology and kinesiology se-
nior, said he exclusively rents his 
textbooks.
He said he doesn’t buy be-
cause there is no guaranteed re-turn, even if the plan is to sell it 
after.
“Renting is just cheaper,” he 
said.Renting books busts bookstores’ backs, benefits students

The last time Patric Young, Scottie 
Wilbekin and Casey Prather played 
together, they were fighting for their lives in the Final Four. Now, they’re battling individually for an NBA ros-ter spot.
Since all three went undrafted at 
the NBA Draft in June, Young (New Orleans Pelicans), Wilbekin (Memphis Grizzlies/Philadelphia 76ers) and Prather (Atlanta Hawks) have headed to their respective teams for summer league action.
In the Las Vegas summer league, 
Young has played his first two games in hopes of landing a roster spot.

AlligatorSports continues its po-
sition breakdown, with this edition 
shining light on the tight ends. The B-position in Kurt Roper’s offense will be broken down in this piece.
The tight end position at Florida 
has been virtually nonexistent since Jordan Reed declared for the NFL Draft following the 2012 season. Tight ends Clay Burton and Tevin Westbrook combined for just four catches for 42 yards in 2013.
The Gators received some good 
news that will help bolster the posi-
tion significantly this season when 
University of Virginia transfer Jake McGee announced his decision to transfer to UF.
McGee is eligible this upcom-
ing season because he is pursuing a graduate degree that is not offered at UVA and therefore is covered in the “one-time transfer exception” 
detailed in NCAA bylaw 14.1.8.1.
McGee’s showcased experience 
and playmaking ability in three 
seasons at UVA, which should earn him a starting spot. 
In 36 games for the Cavaliers, he 
led the team with 71 catches for 769 yards.
A former All-Atlantic Coast Con-
ference tight end, McGee comes through when it counted too — he caught 14 of his 43 total catches last season on third down situations. Florida’s offense last season could only muster a 39-percent conversion rate on third down last season.
McGee’s veteran experience and talented skillset will make him a dangerous target for quarterback Jeff Driskel. His 6-foot-6, 255-pound frame will come in handy with pass blocking schemes for McGee as well — a requirement for the B-position 
which will be broken down later in 
this piece.
Seniors Burton and Westbrook 
returning will provide solid depth behind McGee at the position. While they don’t have many catches in their careers, Roper likes to utilize tight ends early and often within his offensive scheme. Burton and 
Westbrook should see a lot more 
balls thrown their way in the new system, as long as they can be con-sistent targets.
There are a few 2014 signees that 
could see the field early at tight end. DeAndre Goolsby enrolled early, and came in as the No. 3 tight end out of his home state of Kansas. 
He had two catches for 32 yards in 
the Orange and Blue Debut spring game.
Four-star recruit Moral Stephens 
(6-foot-3, 205 pounds, Perry, Fla., Taylor County High) was originally signed as a wide receiver, but will get 
a better chance to see playing time at 
tight end. He has the size that could translate easily to the position.
C’yontai Lewis (6-foot-5, 
212 pounds, Tuscaloosa, Ala., Northridge High) was the second tight end signed in the 2014 class. He was a three-star prospect that chose 
Florida over offers from UCLA and 
Mississippi State.
The B-position is a key compo-
nent of Kurt Roper’s offense. Think of it as a combination of a fullback, tight end and h-back. The position operates mostly in the backfield to direct traffic for a zone rush scheme but will need to be able to provide 
pass protection on certain downs as 
well.
The player will also be placed on 
the line, in the slot or split out wide in some cases as well. Whether the player is there or in the backfield, he will serve as another receiving op-tion unless the play calls for strictly blocking from the b.
McGee has the size to be as ad-
equate a blocker as Florida needs, 
but even more of his upside there is 
that he’s a very capable pass catcher. McGee’s versatility should put him at the top of the depth chart for the position.
Westbrook will also be utilized at the position as well, but given his roots at tight end, he’ll likely be more of a pass catcher, but his 6-foot-5, 257-pound frame could block if needed.  
Another option is fullback Hunt-
er Joyer, who given his natural po-sition could potentially be used in short yardage situations. Joyer being 5-foot-11, however, gives him a dis-advantage if he is used as a blocker.

� TABOR WAS A FIVE-STAR RECRUIT.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Florida freshman cornerback Jalen Tabor 
was cited for marijuana possession of less than 
20 grams in May, according to a Gainesville Po-
lice Department arrest report.
On May 27, police stopped the vehicle Ta-
bor was a passenger in at 725 NW 13th St. after 
an officer smelled marijuana coming from the 
vehicle, according to the report.
A small bag of cannabis fell out of Tabor’s 
shorts when he exited the vehicle, according to 
the report, but Tabor denied this claim after be-ing read his Miranda rights.
Tabor reached a deferred prosecution agree-
ment on June 4, according to Alachua County court records.“Jalen has faced consequences for his actions 
and is very remorseful,” coach Will Muschamp said on Monday. “He is aware that this is not how we represent the University of Florida.”
Tabor, a five-star recruit 
out of Washington D.C. Friendship Collegiate Acad-emy, was ranked the No. 3 cornerback in the 2014 re-
cruiting class and was the 
top prospect out of D.C., ac-cording to Rivals.com.
Muschamp announced 
Tabor as one candidate to start opposite sopho-more Vernon Hargreaves at cornerback for the 2014 season on Monday during the Southeast-ern Conference Media Days in Hoover, Ala.

In comparison, Young recorded just one 
double-double in his senior season at Flor-
ida.
The former Gator standout, who shot 
4-of-9 from the ﬁ  eld and snagged six offen-sive rebounds, put on an all-around perfor-mance coming off the bench. He went on to score 10 points and collect six rebounds in his second game.
“They see me as a little Ben Wallace,” 
Young said according to The Times-Pic-ayune. “And I’m happy with that, play-ing that role. It’s a good feeling, feeling as though I’m wanted.”
Being among 14 players who are com-
peting on the Pelicans summer league team, Young has an opportunity to earn his way onto the roster, but with no guarantees.
Wilbekin, who was the ﬁ  rst to start play-
ing, began his summer league with the Griz-zlies from July 5-11 playing all ﬁ  ve games while averaging 3.4 points and 4.8 assists. 
The former Gators point guard was ﬁ  fth 
on the team in minutes per game (19.8) and shot 80 percent from the free throw line to cap his stint in the Orlando league.
“He’s one of the most surprising players 
in the summer league,” Grizzlies summer league coach Shawn Respert said according to the Orlando Sentinel.
“I felt like early I tagged him as a guy who would do an outstanding job defend-ing on the perimeter and defending the pick-and-roll, which is one of the hardest 
things to do in the NBA. He’s really making 
an impact because of his ability to make the 
offense sputter.”
The 2014 Southeastern Conference play-
er of the year has now taken his abilities 
to the 76ers for the Las Vegas league, and 
through one game had two points, four as-
sists and two steals. 
Lastly, Prather has earned a chance on 
the Hawks squad, yet did not play the ﬁ  rst game. The Jackson, Tenn., native was one of ﬁ  ve not to play in the summer opener due to a coach’s decision. However, he played 20 minutes in Atlanta’s second game and contributed four points and two steals. 
Although he led the Gators last season in 
scoring and earned All-SEC honors, it seems Prather will have competition alongside a heavy guard/forward Hawks lineup.
Lamar Patterson from Pittsburgh and 
Dennis Schröder from Germany are two players similar to Prather who received playing time and added offensive insur-ance.The former Gator center offers support off bench through two gamesTUESDAY, JULY 15, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

HOOVER, Ala. — Whether it 
was saying Kentucky being the 
best road environment he’d expe-rienced in the Southeastern Con-ference, lauding Jeff Driskel as the 
best quarterback in college football 
or admitting Bryan Cox, Jr. actu-ally has the best fade haircut on the team, Vernon Hargreaves III had a whirlwind experience at the 2014 Southeastern Conference media days.
The hotshot sophomore cor-
nerback with the cool haircut and 
shining silver earrings settled into 
proceedings at The Hyatt Regency Birmingham much like he did on the ﬁ  eld last season where he start-ed 10 games in his freshman year. Looking back on 2013, Hargreaves said once the jitters of his ﬁ  rst game were behind him, the conﬁ  dence instilled in him by teammates and 
defensive backs coach Travaris 
Robinson was enough to spur him to do great things last season.“Playing corner(back) you have 
to be conﬁ  dent,” Hargreaves said. “Conﬁ  dent in yourself and your 
abilities. That’s just how I am, I’m 
conﬁ  dent in myself and I know what I can do.”
As conﬁ  dent as he is, he’s not 
completely immune to feeling ner-vous. He calls Alabama running back Derrick Henry “a load” and hopes he doesn’t have to tackle him much when the Gators face the 
Crimson Tide in October. He also 
got cold feet when lining up oppo-site one of the SEC’s best receivers last season.
“The toughest receiver I had 
to cover was Odell Beckham from LSU,” Hargreaves said. “He’s a great player obviously, ﬁ  rst round draft pick. … It was tough, I was 
kind of nervous covering him.”
Hargreaves becomes the de facto 
veteran in a very young secondary 
that could conceivably start three freshmen alongside him. The wealth of knowledge Hargreaves acquired from former Gators Loucheiz Puri-foy and Marcus Roberson will be integral in the way Hargreaves will 
lead his position group moving for-ward. He says his major task is get-
ting the young players to learn the playbooks and need to be brought 
up to speed.
“It doesn’t matter if I was ready 
(to be a leader) or not,” Hargreaves 
said. “I have to do it. I’m going to do it.”
The biggest lesson he learned 
from Purifoy and Roberson was to stay focused, and shut out the outside world. He needed to be OK 
with getting beat once and awhile, 
and realize that football is a 60-minute game.
Florida lost eight of those 60-
minute games last season, some-thing Hargreaves admits he didn’t think was possible for UF to do, but it happened and not he nor his teammates have to right the numer-
ous wrongs of last year.
“4-8 isn’t acceptable at Florida,” 
Hargreaves said. “It’s not a secret, 
everybody knows it. I played pret-ty well this year, I obviously have to get better. I have to bring the young guys along, I have a lot of young corners behind me. I’ve got to show them the ropes.”
Fowler maturing as defensive leader: Just three days after quar-terback Jeff Driskel broke his right ﬁ  bula, which sidelined him for the 
year, defensive tackle Dominique 
Easley tore his anterior cruciate lig-ament and medial meniscus in his right knee in a non-contact drill.
The absence of the senior from 
an already young defense left de-fensive coordinator D.J. Durkin without a leader to lean on through-out the rest of the season. This year, Dante Fowler, Jr. said he’s ready to 
ﬁ  ll Easley’s shoes and be the rock 
the Gators need in the middle of the ﬁ  eld for 2014.
“With the injuries and guys hav-
ing to step up and become leaders, it kind of betters you as a player even though you’re having a bad season,” the junior Buck linebacker said Monday. “It teaches you some 
things going into this season. We’re going to know some things just be-
cause of what happened last sea-son. Everything that happened last 
year has just made us stronger.”
Coach Will Muschamp said 
Fowler has what it takes to be a 
leader on defense this year because the 6-foot-3, 261-pound linebacker will provide an example to the younger players with his perfor-mance on the ﬁ  eld.
In 2013, Fowler led the Gators 
with 10.5 tackles for loss while ty-ing Jaylen Watkins for the team lead in unassisted tackles with 31 in 12 games.
This year, Muschamp expects 
more.
“He’s a guy that’s matured 
over the years,” Muschamp said. “I think in order to be a leader, 
number one, you’ve got to be a 
productive player.  He’s going to be a productive player and he has been a productive player for us.  He has really good work habits.  He’s a really good teammate from the standpoint he has a very positive attitude in our locker room and he affects people in a very positive 
manner.”
Hargreaves, Fowler look to revamp UF defense after loss of veterans
“It doesn’t matter if I was 
ready (to be a leader) or 
not. I have to do it. I’m going 
to do it.”

UF OFFENSE
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
Without consistency at the quar-
terback position, the Florida Gators 
suffered a dismal fate in 2013.
Brent Pease’s offense ﬁ  nished 
109th in the country in passing yards per game, 113th in scor-ing offense and 115th in total of-fense. With no Jeff Driskel to lean 
on down the stretch of the season, 
Pease was ﬁ  red and former Duke head coach Kurt Roper stepped in to ﬁ  ll the vacancy.
Coach Will Muschamp said he 
believes the pairing of Roper and 
Driskel was the best thing to hap-
pen to this offense since he took over at Florida in 2011. With prac-tice beginning Aug. 4 and the sea-son kicking off nearly four weeks later, all that’s left to do is wait and see if Muschamp’s conﬁ  dence in Driskel and company is valid.
“There’s no question when you 
look at our season last year, I knew when Jeff went down it was going to be tough sledding,” Muschamp said. “But I think what we’re do-ing now offensively ﬁ  ts him better. There’s no question that was part of the reason I hired Kurt.”
The Gators’ new spread offense 
that Roper brings to Gainesville 
will help the redshirt junior quar-
terback not only ﬁ  nd more open targets down the ﬁ  eld, but also run the ball more freely across the ﬁ  eld, said Driskel.
“I think there’s more of a chance 
to have plays with my legs,” Driskel said. “I’ve shown in the past that if I do get open space that I can run by DB’s. That’s going to be a big thing for us I think. When you get the defensive starting to key in on 
our running backs, then I think I’ll 
be able to spring some big plays. I think that’s going to be the biggest advantage we have moving for-ward.”
Driskel, who is coming off a 
broken right ﬁ  bula suffered during UF’s 31-17 win against Tennessee on Sept. 21, said he is 100 percent 
after months of rehab with the 
training staff.
Because Tyler Murphy trans-ferred to Boston College follow-ing the end of the 2013 season, Muschamp said that the Gators’ backup quarterback has yet to be determined. However, Muschamp and Roper are hoping Driskel can ﬁ  nally string together his ﬁ  rst full 12-game season so that they won’t have to rely on an inexperienced 
player under center.
In order to fulﬁ  ll Roper’s ideal 
offense with Driskel at the helm, 
Muschamp said the 6-foot-4, 230-pound quarterback will have to dial back his innate competitive na-ture at times and be able to sacriﬁ  ce a few extra yards on the ground for his health.
“Well, I think the great thing 
about Jeff, he’s a great competi-tor,” Muschamp said. “That’s also the bad thing about Jeff. At the end of the day you got to be smart, get yourself down in some situations. We got to do a good job of coaching him in situations, putting him in situations when we need to use his 
legs, when we don’t, and be smart 
about getting down.”
If Driskel can stay on the ﬁ  eld, 
sophomore Vernon Hargreaves III said Roper’s offense would ﬂ  our-ish with how fast it is compared to previous seasons under Pease and Charlie Weiss.
“It’s fast,” Hargreaves said. “It’s 
really fast. They get on the ball. They run a lot of plays. It’s not re-ally hard to adjust to it as a defense, it’s more you’ve got to be mentally ready because they’re going fast and they’re going to run as many plays as they can.”
Dante Fowler, Jr. said that he 
could also see the offense’s progres-
sion into a more hurry-up type sys-
tem from the spring practices ear-lier in the year. Fowler said Driskel was recruited to play Roper’s type of run-and-gun style, so the red-shirt junior should ﬁ  nally be able to ﬂ  ourish and score points.
And despite having to play un-
der his third offensive coordinator 
in four years at Florida, Driskel said 
the learning curve is nothing like it was when he came into the pro-gram as a freshman.Instead, the Oviedo, Fla., native 
said learning Roper’s offense was more about educating himself on the terminology rather than having to implement a totally new play-book.
“It’s actually not as tough as 
you would think,” Driskel said. “When you come in as a freshman, 
the ﬁ  rst offense you learn is going 
to be the hardest one because you don’t know the game like you think you do. At the end of the day, a football play is a football play. It’s just a matter of verbage. So it’s just learning the new verbage. We still have similar plays as we’ve always had.”
With Johnny Manziel, Aaron 
Murray, AJ McCarron and Zach Mettenberger moving on to the NFL, Driskel becomes one of the most veteran quarterbacks in the 
SEC. Hargreaves said Driskel is not 
just one of the more experienced quarterbacks, but also the best in the land.
“I think Jeff is the best quar-terback in college football,” Har-greaves said. “Just from practicing against him everyday, from seeing him play two years ago, from see-ing him play last year the ﬁ  rst three games, I just feel like he’s the best.”
After hearing what his team-
mate had to say about him, Driskel said he felt honored, but he isn’t 
quite ready to anoint himself the 
title of best QB.
“I couldn’t tell you that right 
now,” Driskel said. “I’ll get back to you at the end of the season.”

Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
HOOVER, Ala. — The eyes of college 
football fans are upon Hoover, Ala., all 
week as the 2014 Southeastern Conference 
Media Days kicked off on Monday.
The coach with the hottest seat in the 
country — Will Muschamp — took the po-
dium Monday in a much different situation 
that he saw himself in this time a year ago.
Last year, Florida was coming off of an 
11-2 season, a Sugar Bowl berth and was 
pegged as the SEC East favorite. 
Fast forward 365 days, and the Gators are 
trying to rebound from an injury-plagued, laughingstock of a season. Despite the cir-cumstances, Muschamp remains confident in the team he has heading into the 2014 
season.
“I think we’re going to have an outstand-
ing year, I really do,” he said. “I’m very 
confident in this football team and this staff. I think this is the most complete football 
team we’ve had since I’ve been here from 
the standpoint of offense, defense and spe-cial teams.”
There’s no question that Muschamp was 
shocked by the drastically different way the 2012 and 2013 seasons went. 
But after accepting the fact that it hap-
pened — even at a perennial power like Florida — getting back to work and moving 
forward is the next step.
“I think as a competitor you want to get 
back out on the field, play as soon as you 
can,” Muschamp said. “That’s why I’m re-
ally looking forward to getting to football 
and practicing and developing this football team.”
***There have been a lot of comparisons during this offseason between the 2012 Au-
burn Tigers and the 2013 Gators. 
Both teams had losing seasons. But in 
2013, Auburn, after going 0-8 in the SEC 
just one year earlier, shocked the world by 
winning the conference and playing Florida 
State in the National Championship game. 
Muschamp doesn’t think about the com-
parisons.
“We totally focus on the University of 
Florida and what we need to do to be suc-cessful, and not how somebody else does something,” he said.
Dismissing the similarities between those 
two teams isn’t that illogical. For instance, the Tigers head coach Gus Malzahn was the offensive coordinator at Auburn from 2009-11 before a short stint as head coach at Ar-kansas State in 2012. 
So even after leaving for a year, Malzahn 
already had a good handle on the offensive personnel at Auburn in 2013 — not to men-tion he recruited most of the players who 
started on the roster last season.
Would college football fans love to see 
Florida be 2014’s Auburn? Absolutely. But 
the situations both teams were in are very different.
***One of the most important changes Mus-
champ made in the offseason is the addition of offensive coordinator Kurt Roper, who is 
implementing an up-tempo spread offen-
sive scheme in Gainesville for 2014.
A key component to the offense’s suc-
cess is quarterback Jeff Driskel, who is fully recovered from a broken fibula that he suf-
fered last season against Tennessee on Sept. 
21. Driskel is one of only five starting quar-terbacks returning in the SEC.
For Driskel, Roper’s offense will move 
him to the shotgun as opposed to directly under center — the type of offense he ran in high school at Hagerty. Throughout spring, Driskel looked much more confident from the shotgun, especially when he would take 
off on the run.
“I think what we’re doing now offensive-
ly fits him better,” Muschamp said. “That 
was part of the reason why I hired Kurt and what they do with the quarterback, his 
development at the position, I think Kurt’s 
track record speaks for itself.”
Success for Driskel is simple: Manage the 
game.
While the expectations for Driskel are 
high, considering that, of the three systems he has been in, this one is the most suited to his skill set. He won’t have to have a Johnny Manziel-type season to be successful. 
Given the depth Florida has at running 
back, the offense might not have to rely so much on the passing attack. UF returns Mack Brown, Matt Jones and Kelvin Tay-
lor in the backfield for 2014. Early enrollee 
Brandon Powell also has the talent to con-tribute this fall as well.
“Kelvin Taylor had a great year for us,” 
Muschamp said. “Mack Brown is going into 
his senior year.  Matt Jones missed most of 
last year and missed all of camp with a vi-ral infection, I think the fifth game against LSU, he tore his meniscus.  He’s up over 
230 pounds now, carried it extremely well 
watching him this morning.” 
The best way to deal with being on the 
hot seat is pretty simple in Muschamp’s opinion.
“You combat that by having a good foot-
ball team which we’re going to have,” he said, “and winning games which we’re go-ing to do.”
***Muschamp wasn’t the only coach who 
had controversy heading into the SEC Me-dia Days.
Auburn quarterback Nick Marshall gave 
Gus Malzahn some baggage leading up to SEC Media Days, as Marshall was charged with possession of marijuana on Friday. Marshall was supposed to be in attendance 
in Hoover, but it was announced Sunday 
evening that tight end C.J. Uzomah would take his place.
Malzahn did not directly address what 
Marshall’s punishment would be on Mon-
day at the podium.
“Nick made a mistake and he’ll have to 
deal with the consequences,” he said. “I’m 
not ready to say what those consequences 
are at this time, but he will deal with it.  I 
know he’s regretful and he feels very bad about it.”
The other coach in attendance was Van-
derbilt’s Derek Mason, who is in his first 
year with the Commodores. Mason was 
hired from Stanford, where he served on the Cardinal defensive staff from 2011-2013.
Mason, who inherits a Vanderbilt pro-
gram coming off of a historic two nine-win seasons, said that while those accomplish-ments should be respected, he wants to do a lot more than just win nine games in a year.
“When I look at where we’re at, what’s 
going on, Vanderbilt is a great opportunity, 
a great job,” Mason said. “But my expecta-
tion is to push the envelope a little bit.  We have to move past the idea of playing for nine wins.  Nine wins, it’s really excep-tional.  At the end of the day why have nine when you can have ten.  Why settle for 10 when you can have 11?”

SEC MEDIA DAYS
RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Staff Writer @RagjUF
HOOVER, Ala. — Southeastern Conference commis-
sioner Mike Slive finished the things he does best to 
open SEC media days. 
He left the main ballroom at The Hyatt Regency Bir-
mingham to answer more questions from a swarm of reporters and did a TV hit with Joe Tessitore on ESPN’s set. 
But after those things are done, he stops to give what 
may be the clearest image of the heart inside the man with one of the most influential jobs in intercollegiate athletics.
Slive gave a winding address that included Nelson 
Mandela, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Winston Churchill on Monday. As far as college sports are concerned, per-haps he sees himself as an amalgamation of the three.
He has a quiet and peaceful tone, like that of Mande-
la, as he advanced gracefully through old age. But he is every bit the leader Churchill was with his bulldog-like approach to autonomy for the “power-five” conferences and unabashed plea to the NCAA to enact governance reform now. 
Perhaps his foreboding look at would happen if the 
“power-five” don’t get what they want is a bit like Eisen-hower’s warning about the military industrial complex. It was the last speech Eisenhower gave as president, and Slive’s in the twilight of his career as well at age 73.
“As I have said before,” Slive said, 
“if we do not achieve a positive out-come under the existing big tent of Di-vision I, we will need to consider the establishment of a venue with similar conferences and institutions where we can enact the desired changes in the best interests of our student-athletes.”
He reached into what he affection-
ately calls the “brag bag,” a yearly chest puff devoted to the hardware and accolades the conference he presides over has earned in the last year. It includes a trip to the national championship game for Auburn that was “a minute too long,” a gymnastics national championship for Florida as well as softball and baseball national titles for the conference’s trophy case thanks to the UF and Vanderbilt, respectively.
The brag bag also included a generous nod to the 
conference’s passionate fanbase, but his most specific moment of praise came in the form of patting former Gator center Patric Young on the back, touting him as the model student-athlete.
“(Young) led the Gators to the 2014 SEC men’s bas-ketball tournament title and the NCAA Final Four,” Slive said. 
“Was named the SEC Scholar Athlete of the Year 
twice. Was named the SEC male winner of the Brad Davis Community Service Award. Then he traveled to Africa where he encouraged children to focus on exer-cise and healthy lifestyle. While doing all of that, Patric maintained a 3.4 grade point average.”
He went further than that, saying athletes like Young 
inspire him to “protect intercollegiate athletics, to keep it healthy, vibrant and an integral part of higher educa-tion.” 
His dogged pursuit of NCAA reform is to provide a 
future for those like Young who will come after. 
“The world of intercollegiate athletics is full of po-
tential,” Slive said. “I am certain that our efforts today will ensure its future for tomorrow.”
The fact is, Slive wouldn’t have the pull that he does 
or the hubris to call out the governing body of intercol-legiate athletics if the conference wasn’t this success-ful. 
If the brag bag wasn’t so deep and the flow of money 
so unceasing, the platform for Slive to do what he does and say what he says wouldn’t be there.
His conference is at the forefront nationally in spend-
ing on the nation’s most popular sport and is creating a television network that, while not the first of its kind   will become a media behemoth that will line the SEC’s pockets with cash for decades thanks to a marriage with ESPN.
“We’re talking about football, and it’s football season. 
Football is just one of the sports the network will cover (on SEC Network),” Slive said. “In our first year alone we will carry more than 100 men’s basketball games, 60 women’s basketball games, 75 baseball games, and 50 softball games.”
He walks through the ballroom level of The Hyatt 
Regency Birmingham on his way out to do more inter-views and tout the empire he has maintained over the last 12 years. A red-haired infant barely knee-high to Slive is taking sheepish steps. It’s his granddaughter Abigail, and Slive stops to say hi, an endearing moment of humanity on Monday that doesn’t involve reform or money.
A man behind Slive asks quietly “if he’s the most 
powerful man in college sports, does that make her the most powerful granddaughter?” An astute observation as college sports’ Mandela/Eisenhower/Churchill hy-brid walks away. 
Maybe one day Abigail will understand how grand-
pa pulls the strings of the college football universe — maybe she’ll even be the one holding the brag bag.

ArkansasThe 2013 regular season in the Southeastern Conference was highlighted by Auburn 
and its unlikely leap to the top of the bunch after finishing 2012 without a single league 
victory. The Tigers ruined much of the media’s 2013 preseason projections after running 
the table in the SEC and proved the challenge of predicting team’s fates in July. 
However, the alligatorSports staff took on the arduous task of forecasting the SEC standings for 2014 during its stay in Hoover. Here are our consensus picks on how the 
conference will look like in December:
