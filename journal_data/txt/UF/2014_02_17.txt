The ﬁ  rst thing Neill Shikata 
did after rowing practice Friday 
was check his phone.
Minutes later, he was thrilled 
to ﬁ  nd that he, like his older sis-
ter before him, was accepted to UF.
“I just love the campus and ev-
erything about UF,” he said. “It’s 
a great school.”
But this wasn’t the 17-year-
old’s ﬁ  rst experience at UF. The 
baby Gator completed a three-week architecture program on campus last summer.
He said the opportunity to 
stay in Beaty Towers and “really 
getting to experience dorm life” 
cemented his decision to apply.
Of UF’s 29,319 applicants, 
12,923 were accepted, UF spokes-man Steve Orlando wrote in an email.
The university has an enroll-
ment goal of 6,400 for both Sum-
mer B and Fall terms.
Innovation Academy, which 
allows students the untraditional 
method of attending Spring and Summer terms only, admitted 530 students, he said.
UF’s newest offering, an en-
tirely online bachelor’s degree program called UF Online, ac-cepted three students.
“Of the 54 applications, only 
14 have completed the applica-
tion process at this time,” Orlan-
do said. “The remaining 40 appli-cations will be reviewed as they become complete and decisions released on a rolling basis.”
For the Fall class, the average 
GPA was 4.4, the average SAT was 1960 and the average ACT was 30.UF accepts fewer than half of Fall 2014 applicants

A man in a series of burglaries this weekend snuck 
into the Continuum apartment complex through a 
trash chute and stole a recycling cart, police reported. 
Gainesville Police arrested 40-year-old Titus 
Smoaks on loitering and prowling charges before adding burglary and grand theft charges, according to an arrest report. 
Early Friday, an agent from the complex, located at 
425 W. University Ave., called police and said he saw Smoaks enter the chute and steal the cart, which is val-ued at $630. Video surveillance showed the incident. 
The video also showed Smoaks, wearing gold 
chains and a $100 pendant, walking around other parts of the complex, according to the report. 
Surveillance video at a parking garage located at 
105 SW Third St. showed Smoaks trying to open a car door then reaching into the bed of the truck on the same day. An ofﬁ  cer also spotted Smoaks wearing black rubber gloves pushing on the front window of the Gelato Company, located at 11 SE First Ave. 
Ofﬁ  cers booked Smoaks into the Alachua County 
Jail, where he remained in lieu of a $31,000 bond. Man steals by way

A recent survey of pre-law students 
found the majority preferred a two-year 
model for law programs, but UF’s law 
school is headed in a different direction.
Kaplan Test Prep surveyed nearly 1,400 
pre-law students who had taken the LSAT after preparing with Kaplan courses. This is the ﬁ  rst time Kaplan has asked about devi-ating from typical three-year law programs in its survey to pre-law students, two years 
after President Barack Obama suggested 
the change during his speech at Birming-ham University. Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed preferred the switch to two-year programs.
Glen Stohr, Kaplan’s director of pre-law 
programs, said the results are indicative of law students who are watching the job mar-ket closely.
“These pre-law students — even before 
they go to school — are looking for a prac-tical route,” said Stohr, a long-time LSAT 
instructor.
He said the two-year model is attractive because it removes a year of potential debt 
and gets students into the workforce faster. Removing the third year also presents the 
possibility of replacing it with more intern-
ship opportunities.
But UF Levin College of Law Dean Rob-
ert Jerry said if an employer had to choose between a student from either program, they would likely pick the three-year grad-
uates.Pre-law students want two-year programs, study showsThe average SAT score was 1960

Micaela Montero Dokser
Treasurer candidate
Although she stands alone as the only 
candidate on the Taco Libre Party ticket, 
Micaela Montero Dokser is determined to change the way students view Student Gov-ernment. 
The 21-year-old finance junior, who also 
goes by Mica, is no stranger to SG, having spent about two years involved with the Stu-dents Party.
After being an active member her fresh-
man year and a stint running for the Student Senate District D in 2012, she quickly mor-phed into the field organizer for business, ac-counting and sophomore seats in 2013. Last 
Fall, she served as the Students Party finance 
director.
Montero Dokser said she got involved 
with Taco Libre Party because she believes in bringing everybody’s voice into SG.
“This is fun, this is Student Government, 
this is college — this is supposed to be the time where you try things out and see how things work,” she said. “We’re taking it seri-
ously. But, at the end of the day, every stu-
dent has a right to do this.”
In addition to her SG experience, Monte-
ro Dokser has served as vice president, and vice president of finance, for her professional business fraternity Delta Sigma Pi.
Montero Dokser said she feels her aca-
demic skills, past Student Government ex-perience and transferable skills make her a 
qualified candidate for Student Body trea-
surer.
“I feel like a lot of people may think that 
the treasurer is like the accountant in the back seat,” she said. “You have to know how to make tough decisions and be able to know when something is fair. I’m going to really take care of what the students want.” 
John Bryan, a recent UF alumnus and for-
mer Students Party senator, said Montero Dokser is “tenacious,” and he believes she could be a fresh perspective in SG.
“She represents a fresh set of eyes,” he 
said. “There’s not a big minority or opposi-tion movement this semester. I think that of the people that are left, Mica is a good candi-date to carry on.”MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Cory y effet
President candidate
Cory Yeffet knew he be-
longed in Student Government 
the second he stepped onto the UF campus as a freshman. Now in his final year, he said he in-
tends to go out with a bang as 
the Swamp Party’s candidate for Student Body president.
Beginning his SG career as a 
member of the Freshman Lead-ership Council, the 21-year-old economics and political sci-ence senior worked his way up by serving as a student senator for multiple terms and Student Senate president pro tempore before settling in as the current Student Senate president.
Yeffet, a Phi Delta Theta 
brother who previously served 
as the fraternity’s social chair-
man and internal vice presi-dent, said he thinks he can bring openness and transpar-ency to the Student Body.
“I like to think of myself as 
a good listener — somebody who takes suggestions and makes changes with them,” he 
said. “I know that’s something 
students are always wanting and something I’d be able to deliver to them.”
Yeffet said because of his 
vast experience with SG, he understands how important the responsibilities of the Stu-
dent Body president are.
“You’re the direct voice for 
50,000 students … You’re the 
voice directly to the president of the university,” he said. “I want to be as effective as pos-sible, to really reach out to the students. And when you have an effective individual in such 
a big leadership position, the 
opportunities are endless.”Horace Tucker, the associ-
ate dean and director for the Heavener School of Business, met Yeffet when he was select-ed for the Florida Leadership Academy as one of the top 100 
sophomores in the school of 
business.
He described Yeffet as 
“bright” and “driven.”
“He has progressed steadi-
ly through the Student Gov-ernment system, so he un-derstands how to get things done,” Tucker said. “He has 
the ability to inspire a shared 
vision.”

Cory Yeffet, Vivan Nguyen and Elliot Grasso will be representing the Swamp Party 
as its executive candidates during Student Government elections this week.
Vivan Nguyen
Vice president candidate
Vivan Nguyen has Gator blood 
coursing through her veins, and she’s 
determined to leave her mark on UF.
The 22-year-old physics and music 
senior and Swamp Party vice presiden-tial candidate said her parents, who emigrated from Vietnam in 1975, met 
while attending UF. 
Both of her siblings have attended 
the university as well.
Nguyen set out to wrap up her SG 
career after serving as the Swamp Party president, cabinet director for the Hous-
ing Affairs Cabinet and assistant direc-tor for the Gator Innovators.
Though initially intimidated upon 
arriving at UF as a freshman, Nguyen quickly became involved with Honors 
Ambassadors, where she chaired multi-
ple committees and was elected to serve on the selections committee.
Those leadership positions catapult-
ed her into SG involvement.
“I wanted to make an impact on a 
bigger level,” she said.
Nguyen, who is also a member of the 
Vietnamese student organization, said 
she thinks she fits the vice president 
position because of her widespread in-volvement at UF.
“My diversity sets me apart,” she 
said. “I haven’t worked with just one 
organization ... I’ve really tried to get 
involved with more aspects while I was here at UF. I think I have a good per-
spective on what students want, not just because of my involvement but because of my majors as well.”
If elected, Nguyen said she will be 
the first Vietnamese American to hold 
an executive office in SG history.
In addition, Nguyen sits on the Fine 
Arts College Council, serves on the Presidential Committee of Cultural Pla-za Advisory Committee and sits as the Executive at Large for the UF Board of 
College Councils.
Kevin Orr, Nguyen’s UF piano pro-
fessor, said that in the time he has known 
her, she has always been involved.
“She has always taken a proactive 
position as a student leader, whether in the government of her college or in service to the campus and Gainesville 
community,” he said.
elliot Grasso
Treasurer candidate
Elliot Grasso has been invested in 
the finance aspect of Student Govern-
ment since his first week of Senate when he landed a spot on the Budget and Appropriations Committee. Ever 
since, he kept his eyes focused on the 
Student Body treasurer position.
The 21-year-old finance and infor-
mation systems and operations man-agement junior, who has been rooted in SG since 2012, is hoping to combine his academic and leadership experi-ence as the Swamp Party Student Body treasurer candidate.
“I’ve always seen the Student Body 
treasurer as a position that had the po-tential to do great things,” he said.
Grasso, the Student Senate president 
pro tempore, has served multiple terms as a student senator and a chairperson for the Senate Allocations Committee.
Many of his efforts have been de-
voted to the Inter-Residence Hall Asso-
ciation. Currently, he is the president of 
the Executive Board.
Grasso said that because he was 
involved in multiple SG-funded orga-nizations, he can offer unbiased leader-ship for all students, despite organiza-tion affiliation.
“I’ve learned to be an unbiased 
leader in making sure that I represent 
all students fairly,” he said.
Christine Winget, the adviser for 
IRHA, said Grasso possesses the 
“know-how of budgets” from serving as treasurer and auditor for IRHA.
“He is organized, hardworking, 
builds strong relationships with others and communicates well about policies, procedures and information,” she said. All profiles by Alligator Staff Writer 
Hanna Marcus, hmarcus@alligator.org.He said the college hasn’t started a 
discussion about removing years yet, 
but other possible changes within the 
college are on the horizon. 
The college is looking at ways to 
change its third year to include more “externships,” where students work at law offices under professional 
practitioners, as well as the introduc-
tion of practicum, he said. 
Jerry said practicum would bring 
law professionals into classrooms to teach students the technical aspects of practicing, such as drafting legal 
documents.
This is on top of the college’s eight 
clinical programs, where students gain hands-on experience from law clinics within the college.
“I think we can do better,” he said. 
“We’re doing a lot, but one of our 
goals is to always continuously im-prove the quality of our instruction.”
The details are still being ham-
mered out, but Robert said it’s a like-ly addition to the college.
Although the two-year law school 
model has its benefits, UF students like Arren De La Torre are skeptical 
about the cut to curriculum.
Torre, a 20-year-old UF advertis-
ing junior, said most people believe easier and faster is better, but it’s saf-
er to keep the third year.
“I don’t know if it’s a very smart 
move,” she said. “Three years is al-ready cutting it close for that much knowledge.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2014

Paper hearts and string lights 
festooned the North Central Florida 
YMCA’s basketball gym Friday eve-
ning for the organization’s Second 
Chance Valentine’s Day Prom.
John Bonacci, the CEO of 
North Central Florida YMCA in 
Gainesville, came up with the event 
to give residents who missed or wanted to redo 
their prom expe-riences a chance 
to attend another 
one. 
“We have the 
basketball gym 
here, so it just 
kind of fit the 
prom description,” he said.
The night included a disc jockey, 
a three-course catered meal, flower arrangements and carriage rides pulled by a 20-year-old horse named Ulysses. Each of the 20 guests was 
dubbed prom king and queen upon 
entering.
For those who did not attend 
prom in high school, the event was 
a way to experience it for the first 
time.
Allison Matineau, a 20-year-old 
patient care assistant at UF Health Shands Hospital, said she was un-able to attend prom because she was home-schooled.
“I think (events like this) should 
happen more often,” she said. “This is something I always wanted to do, and a lot of people don’t get a sec-ond opportunity to go to prom.”
For others, the event was a way 
to relive their first prom experi-ences.
Samantha Cordero, a 20-year-
old Santa Fe education sophomore, 
and Alisha Moriceau, a 21-year-old 
UF psychology junior, attended the event as a do-over.The couple dated in high school 
but didn’t attend prom officially to-gether, Moriceau said.  
“I wanted to do it over and actu-
ally give her a corsage, so it kind of worked out,” she said.
DawnMarie Morton, a 42-year-
old YMCA wellness department 
employee, said the event benefits 
the community as well as the par-ticipants. 
“If it helps the ‘Y’ and it helps the 
community I’m all for it,” she said. “Plus you get to party, dance and look pretty.”YMCA hosts second-chance dance for people to attend prom

Working out no longer has to be a 
pain in the butt.
After two years, RecSports is bring-
ing back step for students whose prior-
ity is to have fun.
Rec manager Dan Leary said the 
dance-based cardio class, which start-ed Sunday, will help get people who are intimidated by traditional exercise into a gym.
“It doesn’t even feel like working 
out, but it’s really effective,” he said. 
Leary said the class offers some-
thing RecSports has been missing since 
the previous instructor graduated. 
Her replacement, Christa Ensalaco, agreed.
“RecSports is about catering to ev-
ery patron … and what their view of a healthy lifestyle is,” she said. “Maybe running on a treadmill is not what me or you would want to do.”
Ensalaco, a 20-year-old UF family, 
youth and community sciences sopho-more, said she’s proof there are other ways to stay active. She lost about 40 pounds doing step in middle school.
Because the weekly class is being 
added mid-semester, students inter-ested in signing up need to register for Sunday kickboxing, which was 
canceled because the instructor was 
injured.
Classes are structured so students 
of all experience levels can participate, Ensalaco said.
“If I try out a move and I’m not 
feeling like they’re catching on … I’m going to modify it to their needs,” she said. “I don’t want them to feel self-
defeated.”
Instead, Ensalaco said she wants to 
create an environment where people 
can destress.
Melissa Roberts, a 20-year-old UF 
health science junior, took her first step class Sunday and said she appreciated Ensalaco’s approach.
“It was really fun,” she said. “I 
loved the music.”
Ensalaco said that’s no coinci-
dence.
She said she spends as much time 
on song choice as she does choreogra-phy because participants step easier to songs they already know.
“It’s like going to a club,” she said.RecSports brings back

Protestors lined up along an Archer 
sidewalk Friday night, chanting phrases 
like, “Wendy’s, shame on you. Farm workers 
deserve rights, too.”
Three advocacy groups — UF Coalition 
of Hispanics Integrating Spanish Speakers 
through Advocacy and Service, the Interfaith 
Alliance for Immigrant Justice and the 
Students for Justice in Palestine — met at Wendy’s, located at 3611 SW Archer Road, to protest the company’s refusal to join the Fair Food Campaign.
Initiated by the Coalition of Immokalee 
Workers, the campaign strives to create Fair Food Agreements with corporations to establish more humane farm labor standards 
and fairer wages for farmworkers in its tomato supplier’s operations.
“We want to make sure that we get the 
message across that we want fair food, and 
we do not support a corporation that turns 
its back on injustice,” said Yaissy Solis, a 
22-year-old UF journalism senior and the president of CHISPAS. 
Now that Gator Dining is planning 
to bring a Wendy’s location back to the 
Reitz Union, the students plan to continue 
protesting.
“The informational picket is designed to 
highlight a great injustice that is happening 
in Florida and potentially on our campus if 
Wendy’s comes to the campus,” said Paul Ortiz, an associate history professor at UF and the CHISPAS faculty advisor. “It’s not good enough just to say people are being 
mistreated. We have to try to move people 
to action.”Protestors challenge Wendy’sEach guest was dubbed king and queen

Gators craving opossum, elk and armadillo 
meat got their fix Saturday night at this year’s 
Beast Feast.
In lines that backed up to the edge of the 
property, people patiently waited to sample items like opossum stew and mealworm cup-cakes.
For $15, UF students and Gainesville-area 
residents feasted on about 30 species of wild game at the annual buffet-style dinner held at the Whitehurst Lodge in Archer.
“Beast Feast is … a way for people to try 
something that they have never tried before,” said Adam Duggan, a member of the UF Stu-
dent Chapter of the Wildlife Society, which 
organized the event. “We have a lot of boar, deer, red deer, trout … all kinds of game ani-
mals that, on an average day, you would never 
get to try.”
Eshe Lewis, a UF anthropology second-
year graduate student, said the venison and eggs was her favorite item in the buffet this year.
She also sampled the popular cricket 
brownies present at the dessert table.
“They taste pretty regular,” she said. “I 
think that it’s just in your head …You’re wait-ing for the bugs, but you can’t really taste them.”
In addition to its spread of wild game, this 
year’s feast featured live music, wildlife exhib-its and raffles. Visitors could peruse displays of animal skulls and taxidermy and hold a 6-foot live snake.
Duggan, a 26-year-old UF wildlife ecol-
ogy and conservation senior, said the feast is an annual tradition with a 30-year history. He said the event encourages people to hunt and eat invasive species like feral hogs, muscovy 
ducks and lizards, which can create problems 
in Florida’s wildlife if the populations aren’t 
controlled.
Duggan said most of the feast’s food was 
donated from private ranches, cooperative units and even club members.
“I personally cooked boar myself tonight,” 
he said.MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Long-term space travel, according to a UF profes-
sor, should be made in family groups, and scientists 
expect a mission to another solar system within 70 
years.  UF anthropologist John Moore told the Ameri-can Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston that families are ideal for space journeys be-
cause they provide clear lines of authority and natu-
ral division of labor. “It is possible that travelers born in space can expect to experience many of the same pleasures as their relatives on Earth,” Moore said. About 160 people on a 200-year journey would be 
ideal for future missions, Moore said, which would 
consist of young couples who will bear children in space. The initial crew will be responsible for adjust-ing to space travel so later generations will have suc-
cessful journeys.

Gainesville Police estimated up to three traffic ac-
cidents a week involve pedestrians intersections near 
UF. According to its database, the most dangerous 
intersections are West University Avenue and North-west 17th Street and Northwest 13th Street and 23rd Avenue. GPD reminded people about various types 
of traffic violations and how to avoid them. Florida 
law requires drivers to yield to pedestrians at a cross-walk even when there are no pavement markings, ac-cording to Alligator archives. Drivers may not pass other drivers at a crosswalk, and turning vehicles 
must yield to a pedestrian crossing on a green light or 
a walking signal.

UF President Bernie Machen was among the first 
to don a hard hat and pick up a shovel Friday for the 
groundbreaking ceremony of Cypress Hall.
UF’s 25th residence hall will stand near the northwest 
corner of SW 13th Street and Museum Road.
Norb Dunkel, associate vice president for student 
affairs, said in recent years about 500 to 1,000 students have been turned away from living on campus due to residential shortages.
Cypress Hall will add 255 bed spaces to UF’s hous-
ing, he said. Thirty-five of those bed spaces will be on the first floor for students with disabilities.
“We want more disabled students to come to our 
university, and we want them to live on campus,” Ma-chen said. “When Cypress Hall is complete, UF will join only a handful of universities nationwide that offer such custom-built rooms for the physically disabled.”
Elliot Grasso, student president of Inter-Residence 
Hall Association, spoke about the impact Cypress Hall will have on students. Grasso, a 21-year-old UF finance and information systems junior, said dorms can be an 
integral part of college.
“Living on campus provides students with an experi-
ence unlike any other,” he said.UF breaks ground

Gainesville Police arrested a Delray Beach man 
at a Saturday traffic stop who later told them he was 
hiding marijuana “behind his nuts.” 
Officers arrested Sammy Lee Simmons, 22, on 
charges of marijuana possession and giving false 
identification, according to an arrest report. 
In the early morning, officers 
stopped Simmons for an equip-
ment violation and running a red 
light at the 600 block of West Uni-versity Avenue. 
His car smelled strongly of 
weed, according to the arrest re-port.  
When asked for his license, 
Simmons gave the officer an iden-
tification card and told the officer he lost his driver’s license. 
The person on the card did not look like Sim-
mons, and he couldn’t give the officer his social se-curity number or address, according to the report. He also hesitated while giving his date of birth.
After searching Simmons’ wallet, officers found 
his actual identity card. His driver’s license was sus-pended seven times for traffic fines and child sup-port delinquency, according to the report. 
When they reached the jail, Simmons removed a 
bag of 1.1 grams of marijuana from his genitals. 
Officers booked Simmons into the Alachua Coun-
ty Jail at about 12:30 a.m., where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $15,000 bond.Man hides weed

GatorSavers met its goal of certifying 
600 students in CPR with Automatic Exter-
nal Defibrillator training but failed to break its record of participants at this Saturday’s third annual event.
More than 800 people registered this year, 
about 100 more than in 2013. However, only 690 people actually came to participate.
The one-day event, hosted in the Reitz 
Union Grand Ballroom, brought about 60 certified CPR instructors to the students seeking certification, said Clay Gibbons, di-rector of sales and marketing for GatorCPR and one of three event hosts. 
“We had a lot of no-shows,” Gibbons 
said. “This no-show rate was higher than years past.”
Maggie Schweitzer, GatorSavers presi-
dent, said the classes were based on in-
structional videos from the American Heart 
Association and ended with four real-life emergency scenarios in which students were forced to react in real time.“It’s important for students to become 
CPR-certified because they actually can make a difference,” Schweitzer said.
Grace Hester, an 18-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology freshman, said you never know when you may need to 
save someone’s life.
“I would rather spend a couple of hours 
on a Saturday and learn (CPR) than watch 
helplessly during an emergency,” she said.About 700 Gators learn CPR at Reitz Grand Ballroom eventcAMpuS

should remain 
independent
Problems arise quickly when student newspapers aren’t  
controlled by students, such as Rutgers University’s newspaper, The Daily Targum. Last week, The Targum’s 
former opinions editor spoke out in a piece that appeared in the Hufﬁ  ngton Post about how her right to freedom of speech 
was violated when her goodbye column for the newspaper was 
pulled by the papers’ board of trustees for failing to align with its political values.
The former opinions editor is a young Muslim woman 
named Amani Al-Khatahtbeh. According to her article for the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, “The Board of Trustees is not only catering to the sole requests of Hillel, but is also exercising an overarching and seemingly limitless power over editorial content — positioning itself for an unchecked exercise of censorship. Not only has the 
board been a complete enigma to the editorial staff and public 
and criticized for its lack of transparency, but also information about its membership, capabilities and the limits of its editorial discretion are convoluted and not outlined anywhere on the Targum website.”
Al-Khatahtbeh detailed the intense scrutiny she was placed 
under during her run as opinions editor. She was constantly criticized from the get-go for alleged biases against Israel — even though she published plenty of pro-Israel content.
Colleges, she maintained, are supposed to serve as microcosms 
of society. Thus, college newspapers should serve as a forum for topical and, at times, controversial issues to be discussed — including the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conﬂ  ict.
It only makes sense, then, that papers such as The Targum 
be fully independent. The lack of transparency on the inner workings of the trustees does not foster an environment of integrity and strong ethical values.
The Alligator operates independently. Students make every 
single decision every single night. Sure, this means we make mistakes, but it also means we can’t be told what to print (or what not to print).
This lack of dependence on anyone but ourselves — the 
university, Student Government, trustees — is especially clear to anyone who steps inside our beloved ofﬁ  ce: The 1970s wood paneling, dated vending machines and broken rolling chairs are a far cry from UF’s signature sleek interior decorating in those iconic shades of orange and blue.
And we wouldn’t want it any other way.As young reporters and editors on staff at a functioning 
daily newspaper, our job is both to serve the journalism needs of the UF community and Gainesville as well as to learn how newsrooms are run. 
We hold the Alligator to the same professional and ethical 
standards to which other, larger newspapers are held. 
Our job is not to serve the interests of UF, SG or a board. Our job is to report news accurately and fairly. 
The only way we can do that job is by being independent, and 
we value that above all.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Do you remember the 
day you got into UF? Today’s question: Should universities control their 
student newspapers?SG barely resembles a working democracy
Someone once told me universities were microcosms 
of our society as a whole. A large group of individu-als with varying interests work, live and play under 
the same banner — in this case UF — and even get the op-portunity to govern themselves. However, at UF it raises 
a fascinating question. If our little society is representative 
of society as a whole, why is it that we have such a difﬁ  cult time with the concept of democracy?
As we approach Student Government elections, I mar-
vel at the stories gracing the pages of the Alligator and wonder why, after all these years, democracy still can’t ﬂ  ourish at UF.
Sure, we have elections. But when you have one-party 
rule year after year, that’s not a democracy — it’s a sham.
Members of the Swamp Party would probably boast 
that we have a strong democracy in SG that represents the best interests of UF students, and it has the best plan to make sure UF remains an incredible place for its students. In some cases, that is probably very right, but let’s not kid ourselves; SG still doesn’t resemble a functioning democ-racy.
In an episode from Netﬂ  ix’s wildly popular show 
“House of Cards,” main character Frank Underwood 
proudly states, “Democracy is so overrated.”
Given the current state of SG, it appears Underwood’s 
statement holds some truth.
While under the Unite Party banner — let’s be real, 
Swamp and Unite are the same party — we saw voter in-
timidation tactics, a member caught throwing Alligators away following a major endorsement for the opposition, and now the party doesn’t even have a slate competing against it.
Why even hold elections when those elections will feel 
about as competitive as those so-called democratic elec-tions held in third-world countries?
Criticism on the inability to manage democracy should 
not be directed solely at those in charge, but also those in the minority who couldn’t manage to slate candidates for the election. For a truly democratic election, voters need at least two options, and sadly the Students Party was un-able to meet that goal this year.
The result is that Swamp gets 
to once again hold the reins of SG for another term with little to no consequences for its one-party 
rule.
Can you imagine how quickly 
the U.S. government would di-
minish if only one party — with few representatives from the 
minority party — had complete control over the govern-ment?
Sure, some Democrats and Republicans would marvel 
at the idea of controlling everything without having to 
worry about the other party interfering, but it would put 
the American democracy into a tailspin, leading us down the inevitable path of a dictatorship.
Despite its difﬁ  culties, compromise and competition is 
what makes our form of government strong and why it’s still standing after 238 years. Democratic institutions — even those as small as SG — should take that into account. Competition and compromise will make Swamp, Students and even Taco Libre better parties and better representa-
tives for UF students.
For those currently serving in SG who think this is the 
way politics, governing and elections operate in our larger 
society, in some cases, you may be right, and in others, you may be wrong. But don’t let it stop you from want-ing to uphold the democratic principles that deﬁ  ne this country.
Stop just for a moment and consider whether one-party 
rule is healthy and truly representative of our society. If 
you agree, your society might be more representative of 
Vladimir Putin’s Russia, not American democracy. If you disagree, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and get to work repairing an institution.
For the sake of our little society, I hope we can all work 
to improve our so-called democracy.

Men are bad at sex. At least that’s what 
a recent article published on Cosmo-politan magazine’s website suggests.
I hate to break it to all you gentlemen out 
there, but I found myself nodding along to ev-
erything the author said. When he said, “Any 
guy who puts forth the care and effort to bring a woman to orgasm is basically considered a unicorn,” I literally laughed out loud.
It’s true. As much as we hate to admit it — 
or even talk about it in general — it’s a lot more likely the man will orgasm and the woman to be left unsatisﬁ  ed.
I went downtown the other night and was talking to 
a guy who said that maybe this was just because I hadn’t 
found the right person. Sure, this is possible. But I hear 
complaints from my friends all the time that they had dis-appointing nights or their signiﬁ  cant other could not make them come.
Why is that? The Cosmo article suggests “men don’t 
care enough about pleasing their partners.”
This makes sense because women are so much harder to 
please than men. Brown University says that on average, it takes women 10 to 20 minutes to reach orgasm. Men usu-
ally come after two to three minutes of intercourse.
How unfair.
I’m putting my foot down, though. The bad sex needs 
to stop.
I’m not trying to put the blame solely on you, gentlemen. 
A lot of the problem comes from couples not communicat-ing well.
This will probably be printed on my tombstone, I say it 
that much — good sex comes from good communication.
Once, a guy told me to give him feedback on everything 
he was doing. He didn’t have much experience and wanted to make sure everything was OK. When he said this, my face looked exactly like the heart-eyes emoji, or so I’m guessing.What was so great about the guy? He want-
ed to know what I liked, what I disliked and what he should do to make sure I had a great night.
Everyone who has sex should adopt this at-
titude and strategy.
Being in college, where casual sex is com-
mon, doesn’t help. Figuring out what gets your partner off takes time. The 30-minute pump-and-dump that takes place after 2 a.m.? 
Well, that’s just not enough time for someone to realize it takes exactly six minutes of oral and then intercourse at a 74-degree angle for you to come.
On that note, gentlemen, stop doing the same moves 
over and over. Vaginas  — or any body part for that mat-ter — are special snowﬂ  akes. What worked for your high-school girlfriend one time isn’t guaranteed to work for that girl you brought home from the bar.
I think a lot of the problem also stems from male cocki-
ness. If you think you are God’s greatest gift to the vagina, stop. Do not pass “Go”; do not collect $200.
If you say things like “I’m going to make you come until 
you scream,” or “This will be the best sex you’ve ever had,” 
please stop. Dirty talk is great, but this is just setting your-
self up for failure.
After all this disappointing news, I’m sure you want to 
hear something good. Orgasm is not necessarily the end-game of every sexcapade. Sure, it would be great to come every time, but sex is still fun without it.
Eventually though, you’ll want to orgasm. The great 
thing about this problem is that somewhere out there, there is a man or woman who can give you the best orgasm of 
your life.
And hey, how great is it that you might need to have a 
lot of sex to ﬁ  nd that person?
Robyn Smith is a UF journalism sophomore. Her columns 
appear on Mondays.  Here’s the hard truth: Men are bad at sexColumn
I attended the talk on campus with 
Florida Attorney General Pam Bon-di on Thursday, one of a series of 
events hosted by the Bob Graham Cen-ter here at UF. If you haven’t looked into it, the center has a video archive on its site, and it has brought in a number 
of interesting and important Florida 
political ﬁ  gures.
Although Bondi’s comments fo-
cused mostly on her record as attor-ney general, she also ﬁ  elded questions 
about how she managed to become 
attorney general, her time as a student at UF and her time in law school. And it is here, rather than her discussion of 
her views on current policies, that most 
exempliﬁ  ed the Rick Scott adminis-tration’s disconnect with the average young Floridian.
“When I was in college, I didn’t 
know what I wanted to do,” she said. “I wasn’t even sure I wanted to practice law … When I was in law school, I did a certiﬁ  ed legal internship at the state at-
torney’s ofﬁ  ce, and my dad conspired 
with Bill James, who was the state at-torney at the time because my dad was so worried I didn’t want to practice law. And so I did this internship at the 
state attorney’s ofﬁ  ce, and when you’re certiﬁ  ed, you can try jury trials when 
you’re in law school, so I had four jury trials when I was in law school. Never 
wanted to do anything else.” 
In what was apparently meant to 
be an effort to connect with those of us 
students who aren’t sure what direction we want to go post-graduation, she in-
stead told a story of the well-connected 
being afforded valuable opportunities in spite of a lack of drive to earn them.  
An earlier claim in the evening of “I 
don’t think I’ve ever made a resume in my life” is the type of situation that stu-dents from modest means will likely never encounter. We cannot get a ﬁ  rst-hand preview of life in a high-proﬁ  le 
profession before deciding to work for 
it, and we will probably not get a job handed to us once we graduate with-out needing to apply.
And indeed, her idealistic statement 
of “It’s not always about the money, I’ll tell you that  — it’s about doing what you love. And if you do what you love, it all works out in the end,” rings hol-
low for those of us who cannot fall back 
on familial connections. For most of us currently at UF, there is no guarantee of everything working out in the end, whether we pursue what we love or 
not.
Unfortunately, too many politicians 
like Pam Bondi make up the Republi-
can Party that runs the executive and 
legislative branches of this state. Is it 
any surprise that they’ve pushed for cuts in the type of programs that would help underprivileged Florida students succeed, when they themselves have 
no conception of what it’s like to be 
underprivileged — or, in Bondi’s case, even regular-privileged?
Furthermore, the Republican Party 
in this state isn’t interested in learning these things from us, as is obvious from the Scott administration’s move this past week to block the city’s request to place an early voting site on campus. 
We are not its constituency, and the ad-
ministration is trying its best to keep us from being part of the political process because of it.
Lucky for us, we’re already used to 
working harder for the same opportu-nities, and voting will be just one more thing.

Bondi’s talk shows Republican disconnectGuest columnWe are Ian Matthews and Stephanie Kirkpat-
rick, and we are running as write-in candi-dates for Student Body president and vice 
president, respectively.
Like most of you, we were 
dismayed to learn that only one party’s candidates for the 
ofﬁ  ces would appear on this 
week’s ballot. Before the elec-tion was even held, it was clear that members of fraternities and sororities would again go unrepresented in Student 
Government and ignored by its legislation.
We are running to put an end to this travesty. No 
longer will GDIs and graduate students trample the 
rights of the Greek system, shutting us out of the halls 
of power. No longer will they be able to use their meth-
ods of coercion to drive up turnout and ensure an anti-Greek administration. No longer will they extort from our houses $250 checks just for an impotent seat at the table.
Instead, we will be sure to place Greeks front and 
center. We will only charge $200 from each house for a voice, and we will be sure to make it heard. The alcohol we use as bribes will be of top-shelf quality, rather than 
plastic handles of Popov. And let us be clear: We will 
include mixers, and they will be delivered cold.
You may wonder what our qualiﬁ  cations for ofﬁ  ce 
are. Unfortunately, both being members of the Greek system, we have had no opportunities to hold elective 
ofﬁ  ce or to be appointed to a position within SG. How-
ever, Ian owns two suits and has a respectable haircut, and he plans to earn a spot in his father’s law ﬁ  rm after graduation.
Stephanie, although only coming from modest, up-
per-middle class means, has managed to stand out in the campus community through clubs and academics. Though she is driven to excel in both school and life, she respects traditional gender roles and volunteered 
for the vice president slot rather than run as president 
over Ian.
We could make a lot of hollow promises to you 
and pretend like we care about the Student Body as a 
whole, like the Swamp Party does, so we will. We will 
make sure the library stays open Friday and Saturday nights for those GDIs who don’t have a social life. We will institute a bike-sharing program for students who, for some reason, don’t own scooters. 
Graduate students, you also have demands that we 
will eventually ﬁ  nd out about. We assure you that we have said these things, and we thoroughly believe that we have said them.
We members of fraternities and sororities will al-
ready face disadvantages come graduation. Please join us on Tuesday and Wednesday, and give our people a ﬁ  ghting chance here at the University of Florida.

MOST CUSTOMERS ARE MIDDLE-AGED.

Electronic cigarettes are trending in 
Gainesville.
One company, The Grab Bag Vapor Co., lo-
cated on 407 NE 23rd Ave., specializes in mak-
ing the battery-operated alternative to the tra-
ditional cigarette by using a heating element to change liquids containing nicotine into vapor, 
which can be inhaled like a regular cigarette.
Company owner Greg Geisecke said most 
of its customers are middle-aged Alachua County residents who buy them for health reasons. But the number of college students 
using the products is growing as well.
Paul Doering, a retired UF College of Phar-
macy professor, said use of e-cigarettes comes 
with benefits and hindrances. They’re less harmful than cigarettes, but most of the active ingredients are nicotine-based, which makes them addictive.But Doering said, if given the choice, e-
cigarettes could be a reasonable alternative to cigarettes.
“They’re not 100 percent safe,” he said. 
“How unsafe they are, I think time will only tell.”
Syraj Syed, tobacco education coordinator 
at the UF Area Health Education Centers pro-gram, said there haven’t been enough tests on electronic cigarettes to determine where the program stands on the issue.
Despite some of the negativity surrounding 
this product, the Grab Bag Vapor Co. market-ing assistant Joshua Galarneau said the health benefits outweigh the risks.
“I was a pack-a-day smoker, and then I 
found this,” he said. “The health benefits I’ve seen are just absurd, and that’s why I have such a passion for this now.”
As for the future of e-cigarettes, Geisecke 
said he thinks more people will turn to them, especially young adults.
“College students seem to realize that these 
are healthier for you than actual cigarettes,” he said. “They’re also not smelling like an ashtray anymore.” Local experts debate on pros, cons of electronic cigarettes
� JONATHAN PINE WAS 
SHOT LAST WEEK.

ORLANDO — The widow 
of a slain central Florida sher-
iff’s deputy wore his badge around her neck at his funeral.
Thousands came to Orlando 
on Saturday to mourn Orange County Sheriff’s Deputy Jona-than Pine, who was fatally shot last week while responding to a car burglary call.
Bagpipers and an honor 
guard saluted Pine’s fam-ily at the service at First Bap-tist Church of Orlando. Pine’s 
friends and family are planning 
another memorial service in Louisiana this week.
Pine was remembered as 
a husband and father who pledged to make it home every morning. He was buried at a cemetery in Gotha, Fla.
Sheriff Jerry Demings pre-
sented Bridget Pine with post-humous awards honoring Pine’s “act of bravery in trying to arrest a fleeing felon.”
Pine was responding to re-
ports of car break-ins late Mon-day when he encountered Ben-jamin Holtermann. According to authorities, Pine chased Hol-
termann through nearby back-
yards, but Holtermann opened fire and shot Pine three times.
According to the sheriff’s 
office, Pine’s bulletproof vest stopped two of the shots, but the third entered his chest un-der his arm.
Holtermann was later found 
dead of an apparent self-inflict-ed gunshot wound in a nearby neighborhood.Slain Orange County

A local organization is collecting books and 
money to help stock library shelves in Africa. 
Community members have collected about 
800 books through a partnership between 
two organizations.  The book department at 
the Alachua Habitat for Humanity ReStore, known as the Habitat Bookworms, along with the African Library Project, are gathering and packing books to send to Ghana libraries.
Harold Baranoff, book department manag-
er, said the organization has raised $100 of the $500 needed to send out the shipment.
Shipping the books to the project’s ware-
house in New Orleans costs about $200 and an additional $300 to ship the books to the indi-vidual libraries in Africa the project is working with, Baranoff said.
“We have almost enough books set aside, 
and we’ve started raising the money,” Bara-noff said. “As soon as we have $500, we’ll be 
shipping them out.”
Linda L. Cronin Jones, a UF associate pro-
fessor of science and environmental educa-
tion, said the educational tools that are often viewed as absolute basics are resources that many kids in Africa don’t have access to.
“If you do have access to books that are do-
nated, even for children who can’t afford to go to school, they have a way of getting access to the world,” she said.Jones, who has previously worked in 
Ghana, said education is a major difficulty for many kids in Africa’s developing countries.
Daniel Solernou, a 25-year-old UF political 
science and sociology senior and Habitat for Humanity intern, said the shipping cost is one of the biggest issues faced by the Bookworms.
“I think the goal really is to make as much 
money as they can for the postage and get as many books as they can over to the project,” Solernou said.Bookworms inch toward $500 goal for Ghana librarieslocAl

The subject is a woman working at 
a credit union. The caller provides details, directions and payment.
A team mobilizes, parks out of 
sight and silently hides near a re-inforced security door, waiting to surprise the woman as she exits the building.
The squad synchronizes through a series of nods and pitch pipe noises before executing its highly rehearsed plan — a four-part harmony of Elvis Presley’s “Love Me Tender.”
The Barbergators Chorus, a local 
a cappella group, visited businesses and homes Friday to sing Valen-tine’s Day songs. Interested parties contacted the group to give details 
about where their love interests 
would be. Then the Barbergators sent three quartet groups to the vari-ous locations throughout the day.
The Barbergators charged $50 for 
its performances, which included a flower and a card, said Scott Chat-ten, the vice president of music and performance. He said the price is usually negotiable because the group likes to sing for anyone who wants to listen.
During the afternoon, one of the 
quartets stopped to sing for Kim Cel-lon and her coworkers at her office.
“They are just so good,” she said. 
“They start singing, and they have you melting.”
The experience is rewarding for 
the Barbergators as well.
Member Dave Jacobs said he’s never found anything as musically satisfying. Jacobs said interactions at weekly club meetings help create a tight-knit group of singers.  
“The friendships you make with 
the guys — some who have been here for 30 years — creates a strong bond,” he said. “It blows your mind hearing the life experiences of these 
guys.”
One of the final stops Friday after-
noon was the Atrium at Gainesville, 
a senior living community. The group finalized its 30-minute set be-fore walking through a set of sliding glass doors to perform for a crowd of about 40.
Maureen Steenbeke, the orga-
nizer of the event at the Atrium, said she hires the group several times a year.
Jacobs, who is also the chorus di-
rector, said that for the Barbergators, singing for the community is just as 
enjoyable. The group has expanded 
its size in the last year and is work-ing to branch out its gigs to include more students.
“We’re really trying to become a 
voice in the community,” he said.

Gators in the NBA
Former UF center Joakim Noah scored eight points 
and recorded five rebounds during the NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans on Sunday.The Florida men’s golf team did not play up to par at its one home tournament. Read the 
story on page 13. Hill suffers groin injury
Freshman point guard Kasey Hill left the second half of No. 3 Florida’s win at Kentucky with a groin injury. Billy Donovan said he is not sure of Hill’s status for UF’s home game against Auburn on Wednesday.� GATORS SHOT 33 PERCENT 
FROM FIELD IN FIRST HALF.JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
Throughout the Southeastern Con-
ference schedule, Billy Donovan has 
coached two different teams: the first-
half and second-half Gators.
Once again, No. 3 Florida (23-2, 12-0 
SEC) struggled in the first 20 minutes 
to shoot the ball efficiently against No. 
14 Kentucky (19-6, 9-3 SEC) on Satur-
day. 
However, like clockwork, the 
Gators came out of the break with the hot hand to defeat the Wildcats 69-59 
in Rupp Arena for the first time since 
2007. UF is just the third team to win in Lexington, Ky., since UK coach John Calipari took over in 2009.
“We really had to overcome a really 
poor shooting night,” Donovan said. “We had some decent threes (but) we could not get anything to go down from behind the line.”
Florida sunk only 10 of its 30 shots 
from the field in the first half com-pared to Kentucky’s 11-of-22 shooting performance. The Gators shot just a 
combined 1 of 9 from beyond the arc; 
Scottie Wilbekin landed the only one about four minutes into the game.
Despite the offensive struggles, 
Donovan said he felt good going into 
the half like he did on the road against 
Tennessee on Tuesday.
In both scenarios, the Gators were 
allowing their opponent to shoot at 
least 50 percent while being held be-
low 40 percent themselves. But in each case, Florida wasn’t forced to climb out of a major deficit.
Against Tennessee, Donovan’s 
squad was just down one. And on Sat-urday night, the two SEC rivals were separated by only three points.

Both times UF has played UGA, it has been 
U-G-L-Y. 
On Sunday afternoon, Florida (17-8, 7-5 
Southeastern Conference) dropped its second 
game to Georgia (17-8, 5-7 SEC) this season, 
67-58.
“Georgia really did a great job of setting 
the tone, and we followed the tone they set 
pretty much the entire game,” coach Amanda 
Butler said. 
“We had some spurts when we battled 
but we did not play with Florida toughness 
for 40 minutes, and you’re not going to beat good teams on their home court when you do 
that.”
Many parallels 
can be drawn from 
the Gators’ loss to the Bulldogs about a month ago in the 
O’Connell Center to Florida’s loss Sunday. 
Despite shooting 44.4 percent from three-
point range (4 for 9) and getting into the early bonus, the Gators found themselves down at halftime 35-26. 
Although Georgia was shooting only 5 
for 17 from beyond the arc, it outrebounded Florida 25-15 in the first half. The first half of the matchup earlier in the season between the two teams also yielded similar results — the Bulldogs outrebounded the Gators 22-13 and eventually won the game 68-62 in Gainesville.
In both games, UF shot better from the Georgia beats 
Florida for 
season sweep

Karsten Whitson waited nearly two 
years to get back on the mound, but his re-
turn did not last long.
The redshirt junior right-hander last-
ed only two innings in his season debut against Maryland on Sunday.
Whitson gave up three runs in his first 
inning back to college baseball, but No. 23 Florida’s (2-1) bats bailed him out in the rubber game of its three-game series against Maryland, securing an 8-5 win.
“We’re going to keep running him out 
there,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “He’ll 
figure this thing out.”
Whitson struggled the moment the 
game began. He fell behind the first batter 
he faced, going to a 3-0 count before issu-ing a five-pitch walk. A sacrifice bunt and 
a single later, the 6-foot-4 pitcher was al-
ready pitching from behind.
“If he bounces a breaking ball there, 
he probably gets out of the inning,” 
O’Sullivan said. Terrapins shortstop 
Blake Schmit roped a 
double, and Whitson 
walked another batter.
His saving grace came 
when Maryland designat-
ed hitter Mike Rescigno’s 
crushed double bounced 
over the right-center field 
wall, preventing a fourth run from scoring 
in the inning.
However, Whitson returned after a 
30-pitch first inning and performed mar-ginally better. He gave up a contested infield single, which O’Sullivan argued should have been called a groundout, and 
put runners on the corners after a wild 
pitch on a strikeout.
The seasoned pitcher worked out of the 
jam, striking out first baseman LaMonte Wade and getting an infield grounder to 
end the inning.
O’Sullivan thought that was enough for 
his first outing back.UF bats bail out starter to win season-opening seriesUF W omen’s

The Gators had no trouble at the plate 
during the Easton Desert Classic.
No. 2 Florida swept its five-game sched-
ule in the UNLV-hosted tournament by 
a combined score of 59-6, capping off the weekend with a 15-2 win against No. 22 Minnesota in six innings on Sunday.
Despite only getting one hit through 
the first two innings, the 
Gators (11-0) tied the fifth-highest single-game mark after logging 16 
hits against the Golden 
Gophers (8-1), bringing their total of double-digit hit games to five on the 
season.
The offensive output was the most Flor-
ida recorded since notching 19 hits against 
Florida A&M on March 2, 2013.
“Obviously, we put good swings on 
good pitches,” coach Tim Walton said in a release. 
“I thought our hitters did a good job 
with two strikes. They did a good job all 
weekend long, and anytime a pitcher 
made a mistake, it seemed like they made someone pay.”
Six different players had multiple hits 
for UF in the contest, with freshman Justine 
McLean and junior Bailey Castro leading 
the way with three each. Senior Stephanie Tofft and sophomore Taylor Schwarz each recorded three RBIs, and junior Lauren 
Haeger and freshman Chelsea Herndon both hit home runs against Minnesota.
Herndon, who has only five at-bats so 
far this season, has impressed Walton in 
her few appearances at the plate.
“Chelsea Herndon has a little bit of 
a tough job right now,” he said. “She hasn’t had a start. She’s come off the 
bench and made the most of her at-bats.”  
Freshman Delanie Gourley picked up her 
fourth win of the season and second vic-tory against a ranked opponent after hold-
ing Minnesota to three hits and two earned 
runs. In her four innings against the Gold-en Gophers, the left-handed pitcher re-corded four strikeouts, bringing her total to 22 for the season.
Even though Florida is undefeated, the 
difference in its offensive output in its first two tournaments is day and night.  
The Gators hit 12 home runs over the five-
game stretch in Las Vegas — more than 
double their output in Tampa a week ear-lier. Haeger led the way with four homers on the weekend. Sophomore Kelsey Stew-art also hit her second career inside-the-
park home run against Seattle on Friday.
Still, Florida managed a batting average 
of .404 on the West Coast this weekend af-
ter batting only .278 in Tampa to start the 
season. Seven of Florida’s batters who had 
at least 10 at-bats in Eller Media Stadium posted at least a .333 average.
McLean, who only had one hit prior to 
the trip to Las Vegas, led the team with a 
.538 batting average.
Tofft led the team in RBIs, driving in 11 
runners this weekend. The third baseman’s total included a six-RBI performance dur-
ing Florida’s 19-2 win against Ohio State 
on Saturday, a feat that only seven other 
batters in UF history have accomplished.
In the pitching circle, Gourley, Haeger and senior Hannah Rogers all continued to impress. The trio of starters combined 
for 23 strikeouts to just eight walks and al-
lowed only six earned runs in 29 innings pitched. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 13

Santiago Gavino hits the ball during the SunTrust Gator Invitational 
on Saturday at the Mark Bostick Golf Course. Gavino, who competed as an individual, scored better than any Florida golfer.
MEN’S GOLF
LAYNE WEITZEL
Alligator Writer @laynejweitzel
Florida was eager to make 
a good impression in front of 
friends and family in its lone home tournament of the year at Mark Bostick Golf Course.
“You want to kind of show out 
the one time you’re able to,” ju-nior J.D. Tomlinson said Wednes-day.
But UF will have to wait until 
next season to make that impres-
sion.
The Gators placed 11th in the 
14-team field at the two-day Sun-
Trust Gator Invitational during the weekend — far from the first-place finish they were aiming for. They shot 881 (+41) as a team.
“I said (to the team), ‘This 
might be the darkest day of the season,’ in my opinion, in terms of place of finish relative to where we thought we might be able to 
finish this week,” coach Buddy 
Alexander said.
No. 25 Arkansas won the tour-
nament team title, shooting a col-
lective 849 (+9). Mercer’s Trey 
Rule took the individual medalist 
honor with a 206 (-4) score after competing in a playoff with Flor-ida State’s Hank Lebioda.
Alexander was blunt when 
asked if he could take away any positives about the tournament.
“There was absolutely nothing 
positive about what happened 
this week,” he said. “When the 
same mistakes are being made over and over, then it becomes a 
habit, and it’s not so much a posi-
tive that you can look at and say, ‘Well, there’s some correctable mistakes.’”
Despite the overall poor per-
formance, redshirt junior San-tiago Gavino had his best outing of the season, shooting 215 (+5) 
— the best score out of the seven 
Gators who competed. 
Unfortunately for UF, it did 
not count toward Florida’s team 
score, as Alexander picked Gavi-
no to compete as an individual 
based on his qualifying perfor-mance.
Instead, Alexander chose se-
nior Bill Anderson and redshirt freshman Conor Richardson, 
who have both played sparingly 
in their college careers, to be part of the five-man lineup. Anderson and Richardson finished tied for 
66th place and tied for 73rd, re-
spectively, in the 75-man field, shooting 230 (+20) and 234 (+24).
“I made the call,” Alexander 
said. “Nobody had a worse week as a player than I did as a coach. … I wouldn’t have done anything differently. I did what I thought 
was best and that’s what you al-
ways do.”
But Alexander is not so quick 
to accept his team’s poor per-formance on their home course. 
Florida’s best three players (who 
were included in the five-man lineup) in terms of finish — Eric Banks, Tomlinson and Ryan Orr — shot 10-over par on the last 
nine holes.
For Florida, it has been the 
same story throughout the sea-
son.
“Every tournament seems to 
be kind of like “Groundhog Day” in that we’ve done the same things,” Alexander said. “These guys have had success in their careers as individual players or 
they wouldn’t be here, so we’re 
going to find out what [the prob-lem] is and we’re going to eradi-cate it.”
Count on a change of approach 
in the coming weeks for Florida men’s golf. 
“I’m not giving up, and I don’t 
think (the players are) giving up,” Alexander said. “But we’re going to do some things differ-ently, because what we’re doing is not working.
“We’re in danger of not mak-
ing it to regionals unless we kind of get this thing turned around.”UF collapses at only home tourney

“There was absolutely 
nothing positive about what 
happened this week. When 
the same mistakes are 
being made over and over, 
then it becomes a habit, 
and it’s not so much a 
positive that you can look at 
and say, ‘Well, there’s some 
correctable mistakes.’”

UF coach“That’s encouraging when you walk in 
because a lot of times that can be a recipe 
where you walk in the locker room down 
10 or 12,” Donovan said. 
“And now you’ve got a hole you’ve re-
ally got to battle out of to try to get back 
into it.”
It did not take long for the Gators to 
chip away at the Wildcats’ lead. Fewer than four minutes into the second half, a Wilbekin jumper put Florida ahead 36-34 for the first time since it held a 23-22 ad-
vantage with 5:17 in the first half.
Florida jumped ahead 49-48 with 8:14 
left behind a pair of Wilbekin free throws, 
and the Gators never relinquished the 
lead. 
Similar to the Tennessee game, Mi-
chael Frazier II all but guaranteed the vic-
tory with a late three-pointer to put his team ahead five with a little more than 
four minutes on the clock.
In 12 SEC games, Frazier is 25 of 51 
from beyond the arc in the second half. 
Fortunately for the Gators, the sopho-
more’s clutch performances after the 
break are enough to make up for his 11-of-45 shooting efficiency in the first halves of the games.
But Frazier is not the only one finding 
his stroke in the second half. Against SEC opponents, Florida is 23.4 percent from three in the first half compared to 41.3 percent in the second half.
“It’s just going to be one of those things 
where you’ve got to kind of stay the course,” Donovan said. “It’s a 40-minute game and there’s going to be those kinds of things. It’s always a grind when you’re 
playing on the road.” floor than Georgia did. How-
ever, it was foul trouble and 
rebounding that ultimately 
led to the Gators’ downfall in both contests.
On Sunday, sophomore 
January Miller fouled out 
with 5:18 remaining in the 
game.Miller, normally a spark-
plug in crucial moments, was hardly that against Georgia. Upon fouling out, she had only five points on a 1-for-8 shooting performance. 
Freshman Ronni Williams 
also found herself in foul trouble. 
Racking up four personal 
fouls, Williams scored 10 points on 5-for-8 shooting but grabbed only two boards. 
Senior Jaterra Bonds led 
Florida in rebounds on Sun-day despite having been the team’s top rebounder only three times this season. 
That role is usually re-
served for redshirt junior Kayla Lewis, who led all Southeastern Conference players in rebounding in conference games, averaging 9.5 boards per contest prior to playing UGA.
On Sunday, she pulled 
down only five. 
“We just played a really 
disjointed offensive game and had too many people who weren’t on the same page,” Butler said. “We were trying to find ways to be ag-gressive and consistent, and that small lineup certainly did give us a boost for a while.
“We were just trying to 
create and attack somehow, generate momentum some-how.” 
Although the total re-
bounds were essentially neutralized — Georgia won the battle 39-33 — offensive rebounding was a significant factor in Georgia’s victory. 
The Bulldogs posted 14 sec-
ond-chance points compared to the Gators’ four. 
“Georgia just made 
plays,” Butler said. “They 
had some players who really 
played outside their scouting report, but you have to give them credit. Shacobia Bar-
bee and Erika Ford shot the 
ball great. Those players re-
ally separated them from us [Sunday].”
Florida, now 7-5 in con-
ference play, still has a good chance of finishing in the top half of the conference — the generally accepted finish good enough to get a bid to the NCAA tournament, which it hasn’t played in since 2012. 
Its next opponent, Mis-
souri, is currently 13th in the SEC.
 If the Gators beat the Ti-
gers on Thursday, Florida guarantees at least a .500 fin-ish in SEC play. 14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2014

“It was a combination of things,” O’Sullivan 
said. “It was a long bottom of the second, he 
had a really good second inning. I wanted him 
to leave on a good note. He was at 50 pitches. 
How much more is he going to go? It’s his first outing.”
Eric Hanhold replaced Whitson, and the 
right-hander carried the team while the of-fense took the lead. The sophomore pitched three innings of scoreless ball to give the Gators a chance to build their lead.
After Whitson tossed his last pitch, Flori-
da’s offense made sure he would not be greet-ed with a loss.
After scoring a run on a Taylor Gushue 
sacrifice fly in the first inning, the Gators took 
advantage of walks from first baseman Zack 
Powers and center fielder Buddy Reed and a single by right fielder Braden Mattson.
Martin drove in the first run of the second 
inning on a sacrifice fly, and Mattson scored when a pitch hit second baseman Casey Tur-geon. Gushue drove in the third and fourth runs of the inning on a single to left.
“I knew we were going to get our chances 
to score,” said Gushue, who finished with 
three RBIs. “We capitalized on pretty much 
every single opportunity we got.”
The Gators added the winning runs in the 
fifth inning. The rally began when Mattson walked and freshman A.J. Puk laced a double 
to right, scoring Mattson for the freshman’s 
first career RBI.
Martin followed with a double, bringing 
Mattson around before Martin produced his 
own run on the basepaths.
The sophomore shortstop stole third while 
left fielder Ryan Larson was batting, and the 
ball careened off the third baseman’s glove, allowing Martin to score the final run of the 
game.
“I was pleased with how we swung the 
bats [Sunday],” O’Sullivan said. “We have a 
lot of room to grow, obviously. We need to 
get better at some things, but you get a series 
win this early in the year, you’ve got to feel good about it.”bASE , from page 12hooPS , from page 12Wilbekin gave

Entering the weekend with four meets on 
the agenda didn’t faze the UF track program. 
The Gators showed no signs of fatigue as a 
number of performances highlighted Florida’s 
final day. 
Sprinter Arman Hall, hurdler Eddie Lovett 
and sprinter Hugh Graham Jr. all topped their 
previous personal marks.
Hall’s 20.68 mark in the 200-meter run was 
a meet record and also the second-best time in 
the nation.
Lovett’s season-best 7.69 in the 60-meter 
hurdles was a new meet record and one of seven Gators event victories at the Texas A&M Invitational. 
UF put together a second-place team stand-
ings finish on both the men (83) and women’s (98) sides to close the Texas A&M Invitational on Saturday.
“I was very pleased with what went on in 
College Station,” coach Mike Holloway said in 
a release. 
“Especially Shayla (Sanders) and Antwan 
(Wright) in the 60 meter, and Gino (Hall) in the 
200 meter.
“Stipe (Zunic) continued to get better in the 
shot put. Eddie was just Eddie being Eddie in the hurdles.”
Zunic continued his success from last week’s 
Virginia Tech Elite Meet.
The Croatia native threw an 18.98-meter mark, which moves him fifth all-time in the UF record book. 
He ended with the title to cap the day at 
TAMU. 
Out in Ames, Iowa, at the Iowa State Clas-
sic, Graham claimed both the 60-meter dash with a time of 6.66 seconds, as well as winning the 400-meters in 46.60 seconds.
Sean Obinwa (1:47.76) 
and Andres Arroyo (1:47.97) clocked their season-bests in the 800-meter at the Classic to conclude the day in Ames.

If No. 8 Florida (2-1) has depth anywhere, 
it is in the cage.
Redshirt senior Cara Canington and soph-
omore Mary-Sean Wilcox have been Florida’s 
strongest assets in the Gators’ first three games 
of the season.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said both Caning-
ton and Wilcox offer solid ability in the goal, 
which has been useful for the 11 true freshmen that are still acclimating to college play.
Canington recorded a season high of 13 
saves in Florida’s season-opener at No. 1 North Carolina (2-0) on Feb. 8. In her first game of the 2014 season, she nearly bypassed her current record of 14 saves in a single match.
Wilcox recorded a season-high five saves 
against High Point (1-1) on Saturday. 
The sophomore allowed five goals, but 
she held off High Point as it started to get some momentum in the last 10 minutes of the match.
The 5-foot-3 goalkeeper also allowed the 
Panthers to convert only 1 of 2 shots on free-position opportunities.
O’Leary said the goals against Wilcox were 
not her fault, but were due to an issue in the offense breaking down.
“It was the draw controls,” O’Leary said. 
“You can see how critical they are. 
“We lost a couple of draw controls right in a row and they ended up being goals against us.” 
The Florida coach said the offense’s shaki-
ness on the draws had a lot to do with the shift-ing roster in the final 15 minutes of the game. The Gators have been trying to give playing time to as many freshmen as possible.
“I think Mary-Sean did a phenomenal job 
coming in,” O’Leary said. “We were switch-ing the defense all around, but she came up with some huge saves and got the ball out cleanly.”
Canington played her strongest first half of 
the season against High Point on Saturday. 
The Bel Air, Md., native allowed only two 
goals — a season best — in the 30 minutes she played. The two goals High Point scored on Canington were from free-position shots. Overall, the Panthers had four free-position shots in the first half, but Canington allowed them to convert on two of the four shots.
The senior’s goalkeeping skills held High 
Point off and gave Florida the opportunity to 
climb ahead 14-2 by the end of the first half.
The 12-point lead in the first half gave the 
Gators a running clock at the start of the sec-
ond half, allowing Florida to try and close the game early.
When Wilcox came in after halftime, she 
was tasked with the job of holding High Point back as UF rotated freshmen in and out of the game.
Freshman attacker Sammi Burgess said the 
defense for the Gators was one of the best and has been key in helping the newest members of the team get their feet wet on the field.
No matter how well offense or defense 
is doing, O’Leary is sure her keepers are her strongest assets.
“I feel most comfortable with our goalkeep-
ers,” O’Leary said. “They’re just doing a really good job for us.”Goalkeepers solid for Florida
“It was the draw controls. You can 
see how critical they are. We lost a 
couple of draw controls right in a 
row and they ended up being goals 
against us.”

Kytra Hunter sat out of all 
but one practice last week with 
a stomach illness, but when she 
stuck her landing on vault to earn a perfect 10, she looked unfazed 
by any sickness.
Hunter, who had previously 
scored two consecutive 10s on ﬂ  oor, opened No. 1 Florida’s (6-
0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) 
197.525-196.025 victory over No.11 Arkansas (3-4, 1-4 SEC) on Friday in the O’Connell Center with a 10 
on her ﬁ  rst event of the night.
“I was so happy for Kytra,” 
coach Rhonda Faehn said, “know-
ing that she was sick this week and then knowing that she’s been 
near perfection on that vault so 
many times.”
Hunter is now the second Gator 
in history to have scored three 10s 
in a single season. 
In 1998, Susan Hines scored 
three 10s on vault. A decade has 
passed since Savannah Evans scored UF’s last 10 on vault in 
March 2004.
But Hunter, who did not com-
pete all-around for the ﬁ  rst time 
this year after sitting out on ﬂ  oor, could not build on a strong start after scoring a 10 on vault.The junior scored team lows on 
balance beam (9.40) and uneven 
bars (9.80) with both not counting 
toward UF’s ﬁ  nal score. On beam, Hunter lost her balance and fell off the apparatus to earn the de-duction.
“Yeah, I was 
kicking myself in 
the butt,” Hunt-er said. “But you 
know what? I 
need something to improve on each week.
“I mean, no 
girl ever wants to fall, but you got to get one out of the way.”
Hunter’s 10 on vault brings 
UF’s 10 tally up to ﬁ  ve in the 
team’s six meets this season.
Bridget Sloan, who has contrib-
uted two of UF’s ﬁ  ve 10s, claimed 
three event titles against Arkan-sas: beam (9.900), ﬂ  oor (9.975) 
and all-around (39.750). After 
scoring a 10 on beam in UF’s last meet against Kentucky, Sloan fol-lowed Hunter’s performance with 
another less stable routine against 
Arkansas.
“Bridget’s foot was completely 
off the beam, but just sheer deter-mination and will,” Faehn said. 
“She was not going to come off 
that beam and made the absolute best out of it. And that was really nice to see because they’re not go-
ing to be exceptionally perfect all 
the time.”
Silvia Colussi-Pelaez competed 
on ﬂ  oor for the second consecu-tive week and third time overall. 
Her score of 9.75 was consistent 
with the career high she achieved against Kentucky.
Alaina Johnson tied her career 
high on ﬂ  oor with a 9.925. The last time Johnson scored this well on ﬂ  oor was during her freshman year on Feb. 12, 2011. 
Johnson was the only other 
Gator to compete all-around (39.275).
“Alaina is an exceptional ﬂ  oor 
worker, she really is,” Faehn said. 
“She has a very unique rou-
tine, and dynamic tumbling for as long lines as she has, so it’s a great combination.”
Despite handing Arkansas its 
fourth consecutive loss of the sea-son, Florida felt its performance on Friday was not quite up to par.
“Deﬁ  nitely I thought that we 
got off to a very good start, still not quite getting the landings that were looking for,” Faehn said. “But what I did like was you 
could see that they were ﬁ  ghting 
through everything.”Hunter notches third perfect score 
of 2014 campaign despite illness
