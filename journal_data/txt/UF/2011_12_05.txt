� THE UNIVERSITY NEEDS TO REACT TO STATE 
AND FEDERAL CUTS.
  ERIN JESTER
 Alligator Writer
 Asserting ﬁ  nancial independence was a major 
theme of President Bernie Machen’s strategic discus-
sion at UF’s Board of Trustees meeting Friday.
  UF is entering a critical period, Machen said. State 
funding has decreased, putting the university at a crossroads. 
  In particular, he said, the model for Public Edu-
cation Capital Outlay funds, or PECO funds, once a primary source of state funding, is broken and is un-
likely to return to where it once was.
  To balance this, Trustee Al Warrington said UF 
needs a strategic plan that uses less 
state and federal funding and in-
cludes higher fees and tuition. 
  “We were in la-la land for a long 
time,” he said. “The state has done 
well for us.”
  Now, Warrington said, UF needs 
to control its own destiny, not sim-ply react to the times.
  Although it would be easier to 
take 25 percent of UF’s students from out of state, 
Machen said, he is committed to accepting Floridians 
and will not replace them to balance the budget. 
  “We are doing the things that we said we would 
do,” he said. “We are, as far as I know, the only selec-tive university in the country that takes 95 percent of 
its undergraduates from the state.”
  It doesn’t help that the state legislature treats all 
11 of its public universities the same.
  New College of Florida and UF, for example, have 
very different needs, Machen said. 
  “It may be efﬁ  cient at their end, but it’s not efﬁ  -
cient at ours,” he said. 
New College has no graduate school and enrolls 
800 to 850 students each year, while UF enrolls about 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students. 
  There is not yet a deﬁ  nitive list of things UF will 
have to do to differentiate itself from other schools in 
the state university system. Machen,

 James Clark never saw the car coming. 
  When he woke up in a hospital room at Shands at UF 
on Oct. 31, he couldn’t remember the accident that left him and his bicycle lying across both lanes of Southwest Second Avenue near the Levin College of Law.
  He couldn’t remember the car’s driver, who hit him and 
kept driving, either.
  Clark, 37, a UF alumnus, had recently started going on 
long bicycle rides on Monday mornings to get more exer-cise, he said. 
  “It didn’t work out too well for me,” he said. “I’ve lost 
half a day of my life, and I don’t remember what hap-pened.”
With no witnesses or leads, the odds of ﬁ  nding out who 
hit him are slim, said Cpl. Angelina Valuri, public informa-tion ofﬁ  cer of the Gainesville Police Department.
 GPD is no longer investigating the case, Valuri said.  “Unless someone comes forward with information, this 
case will not be solved,” she said. 
  Someone saw Clark lying in the road and got him emer-
gency medical help. 
  Clark was in the hospital for one day and was unable 
to work for eight days at his dental sales job, for which he travels the area to work with specialty dentists like oral sur-
geons. 
  The accident left him with a concussion, a bone fracture 
to his face and a broken bone in his hand. A gash on his chin 
and a cut on his left eyebrow had to be stitched shut.
    His sunglasses were crushed tight against his eyes, but 
they didn’t break, protecting his eye from being injured from the impact that left a long scrape down his face run-ning from his eyebrow to his chin. 
  Weeks later, he still hasn’t fully recuperated, but he   was 
ﬁ  nally able to get back into his normal routine at home and 
work.    
  Clark remembers seeing a ﬂ  ash of the car, which seemed 
to be small and white.   The white paint on the front tire of his 
blue Trek road bicycle seems to support that hazy memory.   
  They don’t know the make or model of the car or if Clark 
was riding on the bicycle path or in the roadway. 
    Clark has tried to raise awareness about his accident lo-
cally in the hope that someone will call with information.  
  He made ﬂ  iers with photographs of himself and his bi-
cycle post-accident and distributed them in the area. The ﬂ  ier includes a GPD phone number that people can call if they have any information about the accident. 
    So far, no one has called with information.   “I’m satisﬁ  ed that I’ve done everything that I can do,” he 
said. “I’d like to get well and move on.   ”Man still seeks driver who ran him over

Talks about legalizing marijuana 
for medicinal uses are lighting up 
across the state.
A recent bill proposed to the state 
legislature would have Florida join 
the 16 states that currently have legal 
medical marijuana.
American support for legalizing 
marijuana is at a new high of 50 per -
cent, according to an October Gallup Poll. Conservative pollster Fabrizio, McLaughlin & Associates reported in March that 57 percent of Floridians support it, and a 2010 survey from 
Gallup found that 70 percent of Amer -
icans favored legalizing the drug for 
medicinal use.
However, it’s unlikely the measure 
will make it to the 2012 ballot, said 
Beth Rosenson, a UF political science 
associate professor.
Most of the members on the Florida 
legislature are Republican, and pass-
ing a bill of this nature will be diffi-cult because of differences in political opinion, she said. 
“I would think it’s an uphill battle,” 
she said.
In addition, politicians don’t want 
to look like they are supporting drugs, even if the principle behind medici-nal marijuana is alleviating ailing pa-tients, she said.
“There’s a stigma in promoting 
something that supports drug use,” she said.
Grassroots movements have been 
the cause of medical marijuana leg-islation in most of the states where it has been legalized, political science instructor Joshua Huder said.
Some states allow citizens to collect 
signatures for a petition to put an is-sue directly on the ballot, going com-pletely around state legislatures. But 
it’s not like that in Florida. 
“I don’t think it has much of a 
chance to get to the floor,” Huder 
said.
For medicinal marijuana to become 
widely accepted, he said, more states will have to legalize it first. 
“The more it’s in conventional use; 
the more institutions that support this, 
the better chance it has,” he said. 
Even though medical marijuana is 
legal in other states, it’s still illegal un-
der federal law. 
A Schedule I drug, marijuana is 
defined by the federal government as a substance with a high potential for abuse with no accepted medical use, according to the U.S. Drug Enforce-
ment Administration’s website.
As a result, the DEA is cracking 
down on regulation of marijuana in 
states where it can legally be used for medicinal purposes. This has led the governors of Washington and Rhode Island to petition the federal gov-
ernment to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, the same category as 
drugs like morphine and OxyContin, meaning it could be legally prescribed by a doctor under federal law.
John Rohde, the treasurer for the 
student chapter of the National Orga-nization for the Reform of Marijuana 
Law, said because marijuana is cur -
rently a Schedule I drug, the federal 
government won’t fund research for medicinal usage. Until then, people will remain doubtful of any possible benefits it may have, he said.
On campus, NORML has advocat-
ed for medical marijuana. Last year, the organization collected signatures 
for a petition to legalize marijuana 
and helped register people to vote, ac-cording to Rohde.
Despite his support for the pro-
posed bill, Rohde said he couldn’t see the bill being passed with the partisan makeup of the legislature.
“It would be wonderful because 
there are a lot of patients in Florida 
who desperately need that care,” he 
said.
Not everyone agrees that medicinal 
marijuana would be a good thing. 
Patrick Shaffer, a 19-year-old polit-
ical science freshman, thinks if medi-cal marijuana was legalized it would be abused.
“It just seems like an illegitimate 
method to me,” he said. “There’s a reason why it’s not legal now.”
While he sees how it could help 
people, Shaffer said the problems would outweigh the benefits.
“It would just cause more problems 
than it solved,” he said.Marijuana legalization debate reaches new high

 Protesters gathered at a health 
care speak-out event Saturday af-
ternoon to discuss their grievances with current U.S. health care poli-cies.
  The event was held Saturday 
afternoon on Bo Diddley Commu-nity Plaza and was   organized by the Alachua County Labor Party, Occupy Wall Street and Occupy 
Gainesville.
  The speak-out comes at a time when Occupy Wall Street and sub-
sequent movements, including Oc-
cupy Gainesville, are reaching their 
two-month marks.
  Planned speakers, including 
doctors, nurses and other health care workers, talked about their ex-periences, and people were given the chance to give spontaneous tes-timonials.
  “There was a lot of sharing about 
the people who’ve fallen through the cracks of the health care sys-tem,” said Jeremiah Tattersall, an Occupy Gainesville participant.
  Gainesville residents and UF 
students spoke about their experi-ences dealing with medical bills that come with unexpected injuries.
  “The general consensus was the 
health care industry doesn’t serve the people,” said Tommy Baker, an Occupy Gainesville member. Occupy protesters host

  Election Day is Jan. 31, and you have to be 
registered by Jan. 3 to vote in the election. 
  Classes at UF and Santa Fe College start Jan. 9, 
and you don’t want to have to worry about mail-
ing in your application over the break, right?
  Even if you’ve already registered to vote in 
your home county, you have to re-register in Alachua County if you want to vote for city commissioners.  
  The Gainesville City Commission controls 
rules for what days and what hours people can buy liquor in Gainesville; rules about tailgat-ing on UF gamedays; hours clubs and bars can be open; and the process for businesses (that 
can create jobs for students) to set up shop in 
Gainesville.
  Here are three ways you can register to vote.  Option one: Fill out and print an online reg-
istration form. 
  Go to elections.alachua.ﬂ  .us. Scroll over 
“Voter Information” and click on “Register to Vote.”   Click on the link under the words “online registration form.”  Fill out and print that form, sign it and mail it 
to the Supervisor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce, 111 SE First Ave., Gainesville, Fla., 32601, or drop it in the ofﬁ  ce’s mailbox.
      Option two: Pick up a registration form.  If you don’t have a computer, you can pick 
up a registration form at about 130 locations in 
Gainesville, including several Publix supermar-
kets, the Reitz Union and Gainesville schools. You can ﬁ  nd a list at the supervisor’s website under “Pick-Up Registration Form.”
  Option three: Register in person.  If you prefer, you can register to vote by go-
ing to the Supervisor of Elections ofﬁ  ce and ﬁ  ll-ing out an application there.
  Another option is to go to the Samuel P. Harn 
Museum of Art on UF’s campus on Dec. 8 from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. for a voter registration drive.  Deadline to register to vote in

President Bernie Machen discussed his strategic plan for UF during 
the Board of Trustees meeting Friday.
UF partners with Full Sail University
Administrators will discuss those factors with the 
legislature next month. 
Machen stressed that in 10 years, he didn’t want 
to see this year as the point where UF lost its way.
Instead, he said, the university should focus on 
collaboration among disciplines and entrepreneur -
ship.
To that effect, on Thursday the board approved 
a collaboration between UF and Full Sail University 
in two areas: media and entertainment, and business and technology.
Pending approval from the Board of Governors, 
the state university system’s highest governing body, UF and Full Sail will create a resource-sharing pro-gram to enhance degree programs at both schools.
Because UF and Full Sail have different levels of 
accreditation, UF Provost Joe Glover said, ironing out the details of the program will take some time.
UF Trustee Alan Levine said the collaboration 
with Full Sail is a prime example of how UF can as-sert its independence.
Rather than using public resources to create new 
programs, UF and Full Sail will both benefit without using any state money. 
To maintain consistent leadership during these 
changes, Chairman Carlos Alfonso requested an ex-tension of one year to Machen’s contract, which the Board of Trustees approved.
“This was an easy decision on our part,” Machen 
said. “Being able to see some of these things through 
next year makes me feel better.” TruSTeeS , from page 1 resolutions approved at Board of 
Trustees meeting, Dec. 1 and 2:
§ Extension of President Bernie        
Machen’s contract
His contract has been extended from Dec. 31, 2012, to Dec. 31, 2013.
He will not receive a raise during this 
time.
§ Reallocation of the Activity and     
Service fee for Reitz Union renovation
Eighty-seven cents of each student’s 
Activity and Service fee will go toward 
the renovation and expansion of the Reitz Union.
No new fee will be created, and the ex-
isting fee is covered by Bright Futures.
§ New undergraduate enhancement 
fee 
Undergraduate students will pay $89 
each semester to supplement graduate 
assistant stipends.The fee will not be covered by Bright 
Futures.
§ Renovations on selected dorms
Thomas and Buckman halls will have 
air conditioning.Renovations will be completed in 2013.“This was an easy decision on our part.”

Common Reading   
Program isn’t relevant
What is the point of the UF Common Reading Pro-
gram? 
Colleges around the country have started simi-
lar programs that try to get first-year students involved. 
According to the Dean of Students Office website, the 
Common Reading Program at UF is “designed … to stimu-late discussion, critical thinking and encourage a sense of 
community among students, faculty and staff.” 
That all sounds fine and good, but the books that the 
program has selected over the past few years seem so far 
removed from the concerns of college students that one has to wonder whether this program is accomplishing its stated 
goals. 
For one thing, are students even reading these books? 
Unless professors require these readings for their classes, it 
seems unlikely that students will take the time out of their 
last summer before college to read a book, especially the 
ones the schools have chosen. 
The books are also just plain depressing. For the 2009 to 2010 school year, students were required 
to read “The Devil’s Highway,” a book about immigrants 
who try to cross a harsh stretch of desert on the Mexico/
Arizona border to enter the United States. Only 12 of the 26 men survive the journey. 
OK, so the program was trying to get students to think 
about immigration. While immigration is an important is-sue, would it not be more helpful for students to read about the history of immigration policy and receive perspectives from both sides of the issue? This seems like a better way to foster any sort of discussion. 
The reading for next year is called “The Dressmaker of 
Khair Khana.” This book, while possibly good and enjoyable to some, hardly seems relevant to an incoming freshman. 
The program claims that it tries to offer books that are 
“interdisciplinary, global, recently published and relatable to both first-year students and the UF community.” 
But how is a book about a dressmaker in Afghanistan “re-
latable” to an incoming UF student? 
These topics may be important for some students to learn 
and discuss, but they hardly seem interdisciplinary. A book about immigrants might be enjoyable to a political science or journalism major, but it is doubtful that a chemistry or physics major would find it as interesting. Regardless of the 
poor choice of book topics, the goal to create a sense of com-
munity among students is a little ambitious and misguided. 
Creating community among students within their indi-
vidual colleges or departments is important, but trying to achieve some sort of campus-wide sense of community will probably only occur in the football stadium.Personal responsibility is the solution
I am tired of a lack of personal responsibility in America. It is never my fault. It’s always the person standing next to me. There are thousands of people around the world 
angry at the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, saying  ev-eryone’s troubles will be solved if we just tax them more and spread the wealth around. The 99 percent does more to keep itself stuck in that category than the 1 percent ever 
could. Instead of focusing attention on how much better 
(you think) our lives would be if only we could hit Billy Donovan and Will Muschamp with 90-percent tax rates, we should focus instead on what we can do with personal finance and consumer decisions that empower us, the 99 
percent. 
Bank of America recently pulled back its $5-per-month 
debit card fee in the face of countless petitions and cus-
tomer complaints. The reality is that if customers were as-
sertive and took an active role in their personal financial 
decisions, there would be a lot of other fees that would evaporate like that as well. Why do people not pay off their credit cards each month? Except in rare cases, it’s your own fault. You could have eaten a PB&J instead of Chipotle. You 
could have gone to Goodwill and bought $4 jeans instead 
of those great $100 Gap jeans you got “on sale.”
I’m also frustrated that people refuse to blame them-
selves in part for the housing crisis. If you took out a loan to 
buy a house that was greater than three times your yearly 
salary, you helped contribute to the notion that housing prices had nowhere to go but up. It doesn’t matter if you are less sophisticated than the banks. Anyone who took out a $500,000 loan to buy a house when he or she only had 
$50,000 in income is just as responsible for the financial cri-
sis as the big banks that leveraged themselves 30 to 1. If CEOs should be in jail, then anyone who bought a house with a leverage on his or her income of more than 10 to 1 
should be as well. 
The way we talk about unemployment today, it sounds 
as if everybody who is not receiving a paycheck is a victim of evil corporations that refuse 
to hire them. What if a good per -
centage of them are coasting on 
their unemployment benefits? 
The period for these payments is currently 99 weeks. That’s almost 2 years receiving pay without 
working!  
In some states, people are re-
ceiving both disability and unemployment benefits at the 
same time and are planning to transition to Social Security payments after that. I think liberal arts degrees provide a 
fantastic education, but if you major in anthropology, it 
should be obvious that you are going to have to market yourself more aggressively through internships and extra-curricular activities than an accounting major so you can 
get a job. 
If you believe big banks need to be held accountable for 
their actions, then do something about it that matters. If 
you are looking for a savings account or a mortgage, try to do business with banks that didn’t get bailed out. When 
deciding where to put your investment dollars, be wary 
of anyone trying to sell you a product with high fees that are going right in his or her pocket. If millions of Ameri-cans changed their personal financial habits, banking sala-
ries would decrease and much of what Occupy Wall Street 
wants to accomplish would come true without changing any laws or taxes. 
Also, if you can’t get a job at your former wage, lower 
your prospects. If you’re trying to sell your home and the 
price is below what you paid for it, suck it up and take the 
hit if you’re doing it for a good reason. The only way we get out of this economic malaise is by individual Americans believing that better times are ahead, by taking ownership 
for mistakes and by getting over the ones we can’t control.

It took long enough for Facebook to finally pay 
for all the ways it mistreats its users.
The Federal Trade Commission slapped 
Facebook with a sentence of 20 years of privacy audits, requiring the social-networking site to get user approval before sharing information. 
This news came after two years of investiga-
tion by the FTC about Facebook’s “unfair and de-ceptive business practices.”
It’s not a new phenomenon that Facebook 
seems to change itself on a weekly basis. The so-cial networking site is simply trying to squash the 
competition.
However, through the years, Facebook has 
made many mistakes in the privacy department, 
doing a very poor job respecting its users’ priva-
cy. 
Now, the company is finally paying for its 
wrongdoings.
I remember many times being frustrated with 
the way Facebook told us one thing but did an-other.
Back in December 2009, Facebook didn’t 
warn us that information we had designated as 
private—like our friends list—would be made 
public.
Facebook also said that after users deleted their 
accounts, all their photos and information would 
be taken down. However, this information could still be found.
Lastly, Facebook said it wouldn’t share our 
personal information with advertisers, but it did. 
Facebook taunted us with this last lie, posting 
advertisements for different things related to the information we shared.
There are still a handful of privacy issues oth-er than the ones I listed above, and the FTC wants Facebook to address all 
of them or face paying a 
$16,000 fine for each vio-
lation. 
However, these fines to Facebook will only be 
a slap on the wrist to the multibillion-dollar com-pany.
The founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, 
did show some remorse for the way he and his company had handled privacy on their website in 
the past. 
Zuckerberg said in a blog post, “Overall, I think 
we have a good history of providing transparency 
and control over who can see your information. 
That said, I’m the first to admit that we’ve made a 
bunch of mistakes.”
I’m glad Facebook is finally owning up to its 
mistakes, but an apology and watching them pay some fines is not going to be enough to sway pub-
lic trust in the company. 
Facebook will only win over its users’ trust 
once the privacy issues start being cleared up, 
something that may take a few days or weeks 
depending on how serious Facebook takes this 
sentencing.
It will be interesting to see how Facebook fixes 
all its mistakes and the public’s reactions to these changes. 
I’m predicting at first we will all be upset—as 
we are with every Facebook update—but as we soon realize this is a move that Facebook made to boost our privacy, I’m sure we will all be satisfied.

Niner at California State University.Zuckerberg, Facebook are finally

UWireNew Medicare policy overlooks 
importance of dietitians
Medicare announced late Tues-
day that it would now allow cov-
erage for obesity screening and counseling — services that were previously not covered. Sounds 
great, right? The problem with 
this is that the plan only allows reimbursement to physicians and nurses in a primary care setting — dietitians are not included.
As a registered dietitian, I am 
deeply saddened by this decision. Covering obesity counseling is certainly a step in the right direc-
tion, but since when do we ignore 
the professionals who have actu-ally been extensively trained in the area? Registered dietitians go through a full degree program, complete an accredited internship and pass a national exam related to nutrition competencies.   
While doctors are vitally impor -
tant to our medical system, most do not have adequate training in nutri-tional issues. A study published in Academic Medicine in 2010 found that while most schools required “some form” of nutrition educa-tion, only 25 percent of medical schools required a dedicated nutri-tion course. The average medical 
student receives only 19.6 hours of 
nutrition instruction throughout a medical-school career.  
That being said, there are always 
exceptions to the rule. There are doctors who specialize in obesity-related issues and pursue addition-al training in nutrition. Yet, why ig-nore dietitians who have pursued careers and training specifically in the field of nutrition?  
Besides, doctors are already 
pressed for time with patients. Adding intensive nutritional coun-seling to their plates is likely an un-
realistic expectation for many. We 
certainly don’t want this to turn into a quick lecture about losing weight that gets billed as obesity counseling, followed by a patient not losing weight because they still do not understand how to make behavior changes. This gets viewed as a program failure and will ulti-
mately undermine the entire con-
cept of nutrition and fitness coun-seling.
I’m not saying that dietitians are 
the only people important to the fight against obesity. We certainly need many partners involved in this, both inside and outside of the medical realm.  Doctors, dietitians, 
food manufacturers, city planning 
workers, government, school lunch programs, etc. – it will take a soci -
etal shift involving all these part-ners before we see major reductions in obesity rates. But at an individu-al nutrition counseling level, there is no doubt that dietitians need to be part of the solution. 
Would you ask a physical thera-
pist to put a cast on a broken leg? How about going to a speech thera-pist for psychological counseling?  We need to support the appropriate officials if we want desired results. For intensive nutrition counseling, that means a registered dietitian.

Letters to the EditorAUBREY PRIMER
Alligator Contributing Writer  
A UF alumnus has teamed with “Full 
House” actor Dave Coulier to create a web 
series poking fun at ’90s celebrities trying to 
find their way back into the spotlight.
UF graduate Michael Branciforte, along 
with childhood friend Jordan Rozansky and Coulier, created a scripted series, “Can’t Get 
Arrested,” that features celebrities staging 
stunts to regain their fame.
The story begins when two paparazzi 
manipulate a photo of Coulier and “Full House” co-star Jodie Sweetin at lunch. The 
paparazzi impose a wardrobe malfunction 
on Sweetin’s photo. 
When Coulier and Sweetin gain media 
coverage from the photo, fellow ’90s stars begin flocking to them, hoping to attain 
similar attention.
Actors in the web series include Den-
nis Haskins, the “Saved by the Bell” actor who played Principal Richard Belding; 
Kato Kaelin, an actor  better known as an 
O.J. Simpson murder trial witness; and Can-
dace Cameron Bure, D.J. Tanner on “Full 
House.”
“We really want it to resonate with that 
’90s nostalgia,” Branciforte said.
Branciforte, 30, graduated from UF in 
2003 with a bachelor’s degree in sociology and a minor in business.
“Producing was the perfect marriage of 
the two,” he said.Branciforte grew up making short films 
with his younger brother Stephen and al-ways wanted to work in that industry, he said.
When careers with the Consulate Gen-
eral of Israel in Miami and Morgan Stanley, 
didn’t satisfy him, Branciforte turned to what he knew best: producing. 
He finished producing his first film at the 
end of last year.
With a $4,000 budget, Branciforte, Cou-
lier, Rozansky and a small team of directors, 
editors and cinematographers worked hard 
to produce the five-part web series in four days.
“It was a very well-oiled crew,” Branci-
forte said.
As of Sunday evening, the “Can’t Get Ar -
rested” YouTube channel had 59,648 views.
“Through social networking, we’ve been 
reaching out, but another strategy is in the 
works,” Branciforte said.
The team hopes to gain more viewers 
through other media outlets like talk show interviews, Branciforte and Rozansky said.
“A lot of why I like working with Michael 
[Branciforte] so much is because he pushes 
us,” said Rozansky, 25, a Miami native.
When Rozansky graduated from the 
University of Maryland with a bachelor’s degree in English, he had no idea what he 
wanted to do, he said.
“In terms of producing, I didn’t have any 
aspirations,” Rozansky said.
When Rozansky realized that the best 
way for him to approach his ambition of be-
coming a comedy writer was by producing 
his own work, he began making things hap-
pen, he said.
“We are going to work together on a lot 
more stuff,” he said.
Branciforte’s film “Taste It” is in postpro-
duction, and Rozansky is shooting a sketch 
comedy in two weeks.
However, the two are teaming up to cre-
ate a new project in early 2012.
The fifth and final episode of “Can’t Get 
Arrested” is available today at cantgetar -

� MATCHUP PITS GATORS, MUSCHAMP 
AGAINST FORMER COACH MEYER’S NEW TEAM.
TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
 
“As long as Will Muschamp’s the head coach at 
the University of Florida, Urban Meyer’s going to 
be involved in this program. I’ve invited him to the weight room, I’ve invited him to the practice field, I’ve invited him to the meetings.” — Will Mus-
champ, Dec. 14, 2010.
Almost one year after becoming the head 
coach, Muschamp is finally getting a clean break 
from the Urban Era.
Florida, the team Muschamp took over from 
Urban Meyer last December, accepted an invi-
tation to play in the TaxSlayer.com Gator Bowl 
against Ohio State (6-6), the team Meyer signed with last week, severing ties with Gainesville. The two squads will play at EverBank Field in Jacksonville at 1 p.m. on Jan. 2.
Since his introductory press conference, 
Muschamp has on the surface said all the right things about his predecessor. During his first few months on the job, Muschamp went out of his way to compliment Meyer and tell fans he had inherited a fully stocked cupboard.
But as the season wore on and the losses piled 
up, Muschamp has wavered from his original message. After losing to Florida State on Nov . 26, Muschamp chastised his team for being soft. Then, he made a comment that some could have interpreted as a shot at Meyer.
“We’ve got to develop more discipline and 
toughness within what we’re trying to do, which I think we’ve made strides,” he said. “We ain’t got nobody missing practice no more.”
In Meyer’s last season, 
then-freshmen Ronald Powell and Dominique Easley skipped at least 
one practice, according to multiple reports.
Whether Muschamp intended to take a shot 
at Meyer, the next month will certainly be awk-ward.
Ohio State interim coach Luke Fickell hinted 
Sunday night that Meyer would not go to the game then said he could not speak for the new 
head coach when asked to clarify his remarks. 
Asked if Meyer would have input in Ohio State’s offense this month, Fickell said he did JOHN BOOTHE

After spending a season on the 
sidelines, Rutgers transfer Mike Ro-
sario admits his transition back to the 
court is still a work in progress.
While Rosario, a junior, had time 
to learn the Gators’ system during 
his redshirt year, the adjustment 
from just practicing every week to the intensity of in-game situations has been difficult.    
“I feel like now that it’s here and 
I’m playing, it feels a little different still,” Rosario said. “I really haven’t adapted to playing the game yet. It’s been a whole year and a half, so I’m 
getting used to it.”
As Florida’s fourth-leading scorer 
through seven games, the 6-foot-3 
Rosario hasn’t been hurt offensively by his time off. He led the Scarlet 
Knights in scoring his sophomore year with 16.7 points per game and 
is currently the only UF bench player to average double-digits.
“The position that I’m in now, it’s a 
great position I think because not too many guys in the country can come 
off the bench and score double-digits 
for a team like this,” Rosario said. “I feel like I’ve been doing a great job as far as coming off the bench and pro-viding energy for my team.”
His 45.9 shooting percentage from 
three is also second to only junior guard Kenny Boynton among Gators with at least 15 attempts. 
Instead, it has been Rosario’s TOM GREEN

Florida sophomore defensive tackle Dominique Easley 
will miss next month’s TaxSlayer.com Gator Bowl while re-
covering from knee surgery.
Coach Will Muschamp said Sunday that Easley will 
undergo surgery Wednesday to repair the ACL in his left knee.
“It’s unfortunate for him, but he’ll be back and ready to 
roll (next season),” Muschamp said.
Easley suffered the injury early in the second quarter 
of the Gators’ regular-season finale against Florida State on Nov. 26. Easley was helped off the field by trainers and eventually carted to the locker room with what Muschamp 
at the time called a twisted knee.
Marotti to OSU: Muschamp confirmed Sunday that 
strength coach Mickey Marotti has left the team to join Ur -
ban Meyer’s staff at Ohio State.
Marotti and Meyer were both graduate assistants at OSU 
in 1987 and also worked together at Notre Dame in the late 
90s before Meyer named Marotti the director of strength and 
conditioning at Florida in 2005. 
“Mickey did a great job at the University of Florida,” 
Muschamp said. “I appreciate his efforts, but again, we need 
to get stronger. We need to get physically and more men-tally tough, and that starts in the weight room.”
Muschamp said he has no timetable for the “critical” hire 
and that the rest of his staff is intact despite rumors that linebackers coach and special teams coordinator D.J. Durkin would also be joining Meyer’s staff at OSU.
Brantley fine: Quarterback John Brantley is “fine” after 
suffering a concussion late in the first half against FSU and 
is expected to play in the bowl game.

 UF guard
UF Fo otballRosario still adjusting at UFFlorida, Ohio State set to meetnot know.
One Florida player said he would not hesitate 
to talk with Meyer if he saw his former coach in 
Jacksonville, though he admitted it would feel weird. Meyer, who remained on contract with the 
University Athletic Association through Feb. 2, 
was rumored to stop by Florida occasionally since he stepped down. But the player interviewed said he only saw his former coach once in August.
The reaction to Meyer tak-
ing the Ohio State job has been mixed.
“Some guys were a little 
upset about it just because he 
recruited them and stuff,” said the player, who requested an-onymity because the team has not been available for inter -
views since the FSU loss. “But 
other guys were OK with it. You really have to talk to each player. I had no hard feelings about it. The man decided what was best for himself and his family. Who am I to say what he should do?”
Another source close to the team said some 
players were upset when they first heard the news, especially players who have not played much this season.
Contact Tyler Jett at tjett@alligator.org.defensive presence which has forced 
coach Billy Donovan to keep him on the 
bench at times.
Rosario went 0 for 2 from the field 
and played a season-low six minutes of Florida’s four-point loss to Syracuse. 
He came into Friday night averaging 20.2 minutes in six prior games.
“The last couple days, I think emo-
tionally, he just hasn’t been there,” 
Donovan told reporters after the game. 
“I tried to use him a little bit and he just did not seem himself.” 
Against the Orange’s 2-3 zone, 
the Gators’ normally deep rotation of 
3-point shooters was thinned with Ro-
sario on the sidelines for the entire sec-ond half. Florida was already missing 
forward Erik Murphy, who averages 
two threes a game, with a knee injury.
“It was more my decision not to play 
him,” Donovan said. “I actually felt like we needed defense because I knew we 
were going to have a hard time scoring 
with Patric (Young) off the floor.” 
While Rosario wasn’t the only non-
starter that ended up being a non-fac-
tor, his absence magnified the scoring 
burden put on Boynton and senior Erv-ing Walker.
Boynton’s 22 points and Walker’s 17 
accounted for 57 percent of Florida’s of-
fense.“It’s a different transition for me 
because where I was before when I 
got here I was the head guy, the lead-
ing scorer,” Rosario said last Wednes-
day. “Now that I’ve surrounded myself around a lot of good players, I have to do a role that I’m not used to. And now I’ve got to adapt to that and whatever it takes for me to do that role, then I have 
to do that.”

When the NCAA selection 
committee put together the pool 
last Sunday for this year’s volley-
ball tournament, Florida found 
itself in a tough spot.
While the Gators were excited 
to nail down their place in the 64-
team bracket and begin prepping 
for their first opponents, Florida (26-5) did not earn one of the tournament’s 16 seeds and had to go on the road to Cedar Falls, 
Iowa for the opening rounds for 
the first time.
But the Gators proved away 
games weren’t an issue when they secured a win Friday against future Southeastern Conference opponent Missouri and knocked 
off the tournament’s No. 6 seed 
Northern Iowa on Saturday.
Now, the Gators are coming 
home to the O’Connell Center for the tournament’s Sweet 16.
“We’ve had some incred-
ible matches over the years, but we’ve had the benefit that all but one of those, now two, we were at home,” coach Mary Wise said after the win against UNI. “To beat a team as talented and well-coached as Northern Iowa, but to do it on their home court, that was a reflection on these 
two seniors (outside hitter Kristy 
Jaeckel and setter/right-side hit-ter Kelly Murphy) and how well they played.”
Jaeckel and Murphy combined 
for 57 kills in the two matches, as Florida took advantage of its most experienced offensive play-ers to win both of its weekend 
games 3-1 after dropping the first 
set in each.
But it was the thought of 
continuing their season in the O’Connell Center in front of a 
dedicated fan base that really fu-
eled Florida’s motivation to se-cure the wins.
“I think we definitely used 
it, and we embraced it,” Jaeckel said. “We could have thought of it the other way, thinking that it was a disadvantage, but we took ownership of it and we came out 
here and we played with no fear. 
We came out and played as hard as we could.”
The Gainesville regional, 
which has been advertised on banners hung from light poles around campus for months, will begin with a regional semifinal game Friday. The 5 p.m. match 
features two Big 10 teams — Ohio 
State (21-14) and No. 3 seed Illi-nois (29-4).
Florida’s match will follow at 
7 p.m., when the Gators face an-other Big 10 squad, Michigan (22-12). The unseeded Wolverines are coming off a 3-1 victory against Stanford, the tournament’s 11th seed.
The key for the Gators will be to repeat what worked for them against UNI: A balanced attack that begins with solid first con-tact from the backcourt.
“We weren’t just getting digs, we were getting quality digs,” Murphy said. “We were able to set our middles in transition and our pins were open and we were just making smart shots.” MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 15
