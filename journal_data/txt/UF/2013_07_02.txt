Gainesville’s Fourth of July cel-
ebrations are going to be red, white, 
blue and orange all over.
On campus, UF will hold Fan-
fares & Fireworks at 7 p.m. Wednes-day at Flavet Field.
Director of Community Relations 
at the UF College of Journalism and Communications Sue Wagner said the night is free.
“Students, friends and families 
can come relax and listen to live mu-sic, picnic in the grass and watch the ﬁ  reworks,” she said. 
Live performances by Richy 
Stano and Mindwalk, Mark Gaig-nard, the Barstool Prophets and the Gainesville Community Band will be followed by a ﬁ  reworks show at about 9:40 p.m., Wagner said.
For safety reasons, she said, the 
University of Florida Police De-partment prohibits dogs, alcohol or sparklers. Coolers are allowed but may be subject to search.“I hope that the weather holds 
up this year,” said Megan Harmon, a 22-year-old industrial and systems engineering major.
In preparation for the festivities, 
tents selling ﬁ  reworks have sprung up across the city. 
Christopher Hovey, operations 
manager of Kaboom Fireworks tent, located at Butler Plaza, said his sales this summer have been almost triple that of previous years.

ers will come, because they don’t have to worry about county burn Fourth of July sparks ﬁ  rework shows

For Gainesville residents and restaurant owners, the term 
‘doggie bag’ could take on an entirely new meaning.
An ordinance passed in a recent commission meeting that 
now allows restaurants to purchase a permit so customers can 
dine with their dogs on outside patio areas.
The optional permit costs $250.While dogs are allowed on patios and designated outside 
dining areas, pet owners are required to keep them on the leash, and animals are not allowed to pass through the inside of the restaurant.
Gainesville City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins said the 
process of passing the ordinance is unusual because most res-taurant laws are determined by the state. This is one law the city has control over, he said. 
“It is the one exception to the general rule that the state deter-
mines restaurant laws,” he said.
Hawkins said he thinks the permit is a good idea for restau-
rants and residents.
“I think it’s a great idea for people when they want to eat 
out,” he said. “For those who consider their dogs part of their family, it’s a great way to cater to them so they can include their dogs.”
Dog owner and 19-year-old athletic training junior Marissa 
Triassi said that by allowing pets at restaurants, she is able to include Obie, her fox-terrier puppy, in her dinner plans.
“He loves to just sit by us while we eat and hang out,” she 
said. “I think it’s a better option than having to leave him home every time we go out to eat.”
Additionally, the new permit option lets dogs experience dif-
ferent environments and have the opportunity to socialize, she said.

After their Bonnaroo appearance but before Lollapalooza, 
Matt and Kim will play at UF. The indie pop duo will head-
line the second annual Swampfest at 6:30 p.m. July 12 at Fla-vet Field, said Student Government Productions vice chair of marketing Alyssa Fagien. R&B YouTube sensation Ahmir and another indie pop group, Cults, will also be performing. SGP chairman Daniel Levin would not disclose the amounts 
the artists will be paid.
The showcase, which SGP will present in conjunction with 
Student Government, Visa and Reitz Union Board Entertain-ment, is free and open to the public, Fagien said. Alcohol, big backpacks and coolers are not permitted.
“The show will go on, rain or shine,” she said.Fagien said last year Swampfest was held in the Spring, but 
due to complications it was moved to Summer B.“I am excited that it is being held during Summer B because 
it gives incoming freshman a chance to attend the concert and learn more about SGP and Student Government at UF,” Fagien said.
Lisa Hernando, a 22-year-old economics student at UF, said 
she is excited to see Matt and Kim.
“I’ve seen them live before,” she said. “The audience goes 
crazy when Matt and Kim perform. The experience is abso-lutely exhilarating.”Indie pop band Matt and Kim to headline next week’s SwampfestSEE FIREWORKS, PAGE 4

food Restaurant, added that allowing people to bring their pets to 
eat with them is fun, and it could be beneﬁ  cial for restaurants.
“Lots of people walk their dogs around here and want to be 
able to bring them,” he said. “They don’t want to leave them at home. People are close with their pets, and in the long run, that $250, over the course, would bring in that much more business.”
However, some restaurant owners are not pleased with the 
$250 permit.
Gabriel Garner, owner of the Jones B-Side, which has allowed 
pets on his restaurant’s patio in the past, said he is unsure about whether he would be willing to pay the price.
“We’ve allowed dogs on the patio for a while, and a lot of 
other restaurants have, too. We’ve even had a cat on a leash and a lizard,” he said. “It sounds like the City of Gainesville is just trying to make more money.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 2, 2013

Gainesville party animals look-
ing to make it on the silver screen 
may soon have their chance.
Brick City TV is seeking to pro-duce a reality TV show based on the nightlife promotion scene in Gainesville.
Representatives from New York 
production companies Brick City TV and Blowback Productions will hold an open casting call today at Pledge 5 Foundation, at 1227 W. University Ave. The auditions will run from 8 p.m.-1 a.m.
Nick Burnett, one of the show’s producers, said he hopes to portray loud characters and interesting people on the show.
He said the program’s concept 
is to illustrate “the unique world of this small little town in northern Florida that has this gigantic, big-ger-than-life nightlife scene.”
Burnett said Gainesville night-
life delivers “more high stakes competition and drama than one would imagine for a little college town.”
Blowback Productions has made 
more than 20 award-winning ﬁ  lms that have garnered awards such as Emmys and CableACE awards.
Brick City TV will also be ﬁ  lm-
ing Wednesday through Saturday at events including Excision at Fo-rum, Chateau at Sharab Lounge and Scene at Status Nightclub in downtown Gainesville.
Alex Kindred, a 21-year-old 
Santa Fe College business sopho-more, said she is excited to attend the casting call.
Kindred said she goes out fre-
quently and that the Gainesville nightlife scene is a signiﬁ  cant part of her life.
“I think I’d be perfect for the 
show,” Kindred said.

Gainesville Fire Rescue advises caution when using ﬁ  reworks
bans,” Hovey said.
Hovey said there are currently no burn 
bans in place for the county because condi-
tions have been so damp.
According to the National Fire Protection 
Association, more ﬁ  res are reported on Inde-pendence Day than on any other day. Accord-ing to Gainesville Fire Rescue, ﬁ  reworks are illegal when used by consumers.
“Anything that goes up in the air and goes 
boom is not allowed,” said GFR Assistant Chief JoAnne Rice.
Rice said a loophole allows ﬁ  reworks to be 
sold at stands like Kaboom’s.“The people that buy those sign a waiver 
that says they’re using them for agricultural purposes,” said Rice. “The state statute says that once they sign that, [the ﬁ  re department] has no authority.”
Hovey said his tent was inspected and ap-
proved by the ﬁ  re marshal, and that safety is a priority.“Everything that they purchase, I give a 
demonstration,” Hovey said. “I make sure the customer understands thoroughly, or I do not sell it to them.”
Rice advised people to supervise children 
closely, be careful with loose clothing, and keep a ﬁ  re extinguisher or bucket of water close by.
FIREWORKS , from page 1TUESDAY, JULY 2, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5
    July  7, 1977: Fireworks never went 
off during Gainesville’s Independence Day 
festivities at downtown plaza. 
About 10,000 people crowded the 
area, designed for 2,000,  to see the widely publicized fireworks display. The community plaza director, Stathe Karahalios, said the crowd was “potentially unruly,” so he canceled the fireworks. 
However, when the spectators heard the 
show was canceled, they were angered and shook their Budweisers at the policemen. 
    July 1, 1980: Police dog named 
Yankee chases down one of two suspected tire thieves. The canine helped Gainesville Police apprehend a 19-year-old man, who was trying to flee on foot.     July 3, 1990: UF comes out with 
its “All-In-One” ID cards, which allow students to pay their fees, check out library books and eat at UF cafeterias. 
The cards replaced the use of separate 
Gator Dining Service cards, Infirmary cards, football ticket coupons, credit cards and dormitory room keys. UF students could buy the cards for $5.
Interim Administrative Affairs 
Associate Vice President Ed Poppell said he was optimistic about the new cards. 
“The cards will bring a corporate 
identity to UF. The card will bring a feeling of university pride and exhibit our unity,” he said. 
    July 1, 1993: The bats at UF were 
forced out of the campus athletic facilities and into a $30,000 home built especially for them in 1991.
However, the bats were not interested 
in making the move. After a few weeks, the bats began to leave, and it was clear they did not like the new facility and left. In 1993, the bats began to return to the house. 
University Athletic Association 
Operation and Facilities Coordinator Danny Sheldon said he was encouraged that some of the bats were finally using the home. 
He said he hoped they would all return 
one day. 
    July 2, 2002: The Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences considers a more up-to-date and familiar name in order to reach out to UF students. 
Mike Martin, UF’s vice president for 
agriculture and natural resources,  said that a new name for IFAS is a good idea in order to make it easier for people to recognize the department. 
“Due to all the things we do, I don’t think 
IFAS still captures entirely what we do,” he said. “I think it is a good idea to evaluate the possibility of a name change.”

DOMA is dead, and some locals 
are celebrating.
In a landmark decision Wednes-
day, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 
same-sex married couples can now receive the same federal benefits as heterosexual ones.
The court declared the Defense 
of Marriage Act, a law signed by Bill Clinton in 1996 preventing the federal government from recogniz-ing same-sex marriages legalized by states for the purposes of federal benefits, unconstitutional by a 5-4 vote.
Gainesville Community Alliance 
founder and president Joseph Anto-nelli said the ruling is a step in the right direction. The country is mov-ing forward, he said.
Although Florida does not rec-
ognize same-sex marriages or civil unions, cities like Miami and Orlan-do have recently allowed domestic partnerships. UF extends domes-tic partner health insurance to all benefits-eligible faculty and staff, according to its human resources website.
Those kinds of benefits are what 
matter, said UF public relations junior Chris Pereira, who married Santa Fe journalism sophomore Raul Rodriguez in New York in De-cember.
“Anyone can have a ceremony 
and consider themselves married,” Rodriguez, 25, agreed. “It’s more about the benefits that a couple ac-quires after becoming legally mar-ried.”
Pereira, 20, said he thinks there 
are not any missing benefits in the states that have already passed mar-riage equality.
Jarrod Cruz-Stipsits, the inter-
cultural engagement director for UF Multicultural & Diversity Affairs, said the biggest victory is that more than a thousand different tax breaks, rights and benefits will be provided to same-sex married couples across the country.
“Same-sex couples will now be 
able to file joint taxes,” Cruz-Stip-sits said. “[They] will be guaran-teed under the federal government federal rights ... that straight people and straight married couples would as well.”
Throughout most of the over-
arching Supreme Court case, United States v. Windsor, a group within the U.S. House of Representatives called the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group — BLAG, for short — volun-tarily defended Section 3 of DOMA, even after U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was directed by Obama to stop enforcing it.
Section 3, until recently, put into 
writing federal nonrecognition of same-sex marriages for the purpos-es of federal benefits, such as joint tax returns.
It didn’t, however, affect states’ 
laws. Even so, not everyone agreed with the decision.
In a statement, Sen. Marco Rubio 
said he thought “the Supreme Court made a serious mistake today when it overstepped its important, but limited role.”
“I believe that marriage is a 
unique historical institution best de-fined as the union between one man and one woman,” he continued.
But Antonelli remains hopeful 
that other states will soon legalize same-sex marriage.
“What we’ve done is we’ve 
cracked open the egg, and now we’re after the ingredients, and we won’t be satisfied until we’ve made a new omelet,” he said. “It’s going to happen.”

We need to stand 
for our rights
It was recently revealed that the U.S. has been engaged in 
the widespread monitoring of European Union diplomats. Edward Snowden’s leaks reveal that the National Security 
Agency bugged EU diplomatic ofﬁ  ces in Washington and New York, hacked into its computer networks and monitored phone lines at its headquarters in Brussels.
“We are no longer in the Cold War,” German Chancellor An-
gela Merkel’s spokesperson said. But in a sense, we are living in a Cold War-type of scenario. As before, the whole world is being held hostage. Before, annihilation was a very real threat as the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. engaged in a wild, global power grab. But now, there’s a different threat to the safety of humanity.
In a post-evil empire world, what role have the supposed 
victors played? The U.S. government is a machine of immense power. It can spy on nearly anyone in the world, especially with a desire to. It can also, as we learned from Iraq, lead us to strike another country preemptively based on a lie without a declara-tion of war and stay engaged there for a long time.
This machine kills innocent children with drones and man-
ages to get away without word from the mainstream media.
Once upon a time, the people, or our representatives, would 
have the chance to debate decisions in the public. Now these de-cisions are made by unelected bureaucrats, including generals, and even most of our representatives are too spineless or don’t care enough to debate the morbid disrespect of power that’s tak-ing place. 
Each drone missile costs lots of money. Every cyber attack 
costs money. Whether we like it, we’re instruments to the ma-chine’s ends. The machine has been allowed to grow and grow unchecked until now — ﬁ  nally — when some of the curtain is pulled back. And it’s clear that something big — very big — happened when Snowden did that because powerful icons from both the left and the right now hate him. 
Are we living in “1984”? While we wouldn’t say that there’s 
no freedom of the press left in this country, shoddy reporting and spin doctoring in the mainstream media are reminiscent of George Orwell’s Ministry of Truth when heroes like Snowden are repeatedly painted as infamous.
Just in case you’re not sold on the “1984” idea, Julian As-
sange, de facto leader of WikiLeaks, recently appeared on ABC News and talked about the special court that the U.S. wants to send both him and Snowden to where they can be convicted quickly with a more than 99 percent certainty. “What does the law mean if there are secret interpretations in secret courts?” As-sange asked. 
Obama has a lot to answer for, but he’s just a link in the chain. 
We’re to blame, too, if nothing gets done to change all of this.
The whole world sees what’s happening. Who has the power 
to stand up to the machine and say enough is enough? Only the people do. It’s up to us and only up to us. It is up to the public to bear the responsibility of ﬁ  xing things in a democracy when the government is broken. Republicans and Democrats have failed us. Let’s remember that on our next visit to the polls.
Play on: Make college feel like a game
In the fall of 1997, an elite team of artists and engineers 
took a risk worth hundreds of millions. Weeks before their company Valve was expected to release a blockbust-
er video game, they pulled the plug on the project, shocking people worldwide. “We needed to start over,” Senior Engi-neer Ken Birdwell wrote, “because our game wasn’t fun.” 
While some ﬁ  rms would have launched it anyway, Valve 
went back to the drawing board to make its action-adventure title, “Half-Life,” feel more engaging. Through an unusual collaborative process, the Washington-based studio trans-formed Half-Life into one of the most successful games of all time.
Its success is relevant today because of “gamiﬁ  cation”: 
Colleges are using games to help students internalize ideas and make learning more fun. Last year, Marston Science Li-brary and the UF Digital Worlds Institute used mini-games to teach students about the ethics of intellectual property. 
To the extent that games facilitate deeper and more en-
joyable learning, near-perfect titles like “Half-Life” offer blueprints for “gamifying” education. Birdwell and his col-leagues’ experience translates into three practical tips for stu-dents and teachers.
First, professors must embrace interdisciplinary collabo-
ration. Valve established a group of artists, engineers and business people, many of whom had never worked together directly. “Include an expert from every functional area (pro-gramming, art and so on),” Birdwell wrote. “Arguing over an issue that no one at the meeting actually understands is a sure way to waste everyone’s time.”
The extra time commitment was initially frustrating, but 
it boosted everyone’s creativity.
When I was a science writer for Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology about two years ago, professors at the Institute referred to these partnerships as “collisions” — as in particles colliding. After World War II, a shortage of space prompted MIT to cram linguists, physicists and engineers into the icon-ic Building 20. Collisions in that workspace catalyzed inno-vations such as the ﬁ  rst video game, Bose sound systems and Chomskyan linguistics.
The second insight from “Half-Life” is that students must think “the world” cares. When players shot barrels in the game’s ﬁ  rst version, the objects barely moved. When they smacked win-dows with a wrench, glass didn’t shatter. Behavior had no observ-able consequences. 
“If you want players to care 
about the world,” Birdwell wrote, “the world should care about 
players.”
Likewise, students may lose interest in the world of col-
lege if it doesn’t offer cues reﬂ  ecting their progress. The ideal solution — professors giving personal feedback — seems unreasonable for UF classes with hundreds of students, but software can help. Existing ISIS and e-Learning data could be used to monitor science and math skills across courses, and students could receive a text message for improving their skills as if they were “leveling up” in a video game.
Third, students should know when to blame themselves 
for failure. “If the game kills (players) off with no warning, then players blame the game and start to dislike it,” Birdwell wrote. “But if the game ... shows players a way out and they die anyway, then they’ve let the game down, and they need to try a little harder.”
In other words, we should be aware enough of our mis-
takes to know whether we should blame the education sys-tem or ourselves.
I learned this lesson while taking a newspaper report-

The success of “Half-Life” shows games are powerful. 
Played on a football ﬁ  eld, a card table or a computer, they immerse students in an exciting imaginative world. When gamiﬁ  cation is done well, following the three insights from this classic game, it can bring greater meaning and joy to the classroom.

At some point a week ago, a show 
became a spectacle.
Sen. Wendy Davis, a Democrat 
from Fort Worth, Texas, attempted a ﬁ  li-buster during the last day of a special ses-sion in order to defeat an abortion bill from being voted upon.
Governor Rick Perry had already pub-
licly vowed to sign the bill if it passed the Senate. Eleven hours in, she was quieted on a third point of order, which was the second point of order on germaneness.
In the U.S. Senate, senators can vary 
from topic to topic during a ﬁ  libuster, so long as they keep talking; in the Texas Senate, everything must be on the topic being ﬁ  libustered. That second point on germaneness — deﬁ  ned as “closely or sig-niﬁ  cantly related” by www.dictionary.com — was due to Davis talking about how a law from the previous Senate session had already placed restrictions on abortions. It was a questionable decision at best, and it ﬁ  red up people watching both inside and outside the building.
Despite Davis being quieted, she re-
mained standing on the ﬂ  oor while other senators took up the cause. One of those senators was Leticia Van de Putte. She was late to the day’s meeting, as she had at-tended the funeral of her father.
Van de Putte had made a motion to ad-
journ the senate, which in the Texas Senate is supposed to take priority over other mo-tions. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst did not rec-ognize her motion, though it is unknown as to whether he did so intentionally.
As the clock neared midnight central 
time, Van de Putte stood calmly as she had the ﬂ  oor, releasing one of the best quotes from the night:
“At what point must a female senator 
raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?”
After she said this, the crowd watching 
went wild for almost 15 minutes, prevent-ing a vote from being effectively taken. De-whurst tried, and an attempt at a vote was recorded. It was in vain, as the clock had passed midnight.
Or had it?The website of the Texas Senate, al-
though initially saying the vote had been taken after midnight, had been changed some time af-ter midnight to say the vote had been taken be-fore, according to a screenshot on Twitter posted by @MatthewKey-sLive. This was in contrast to the 
thousands of people who watched the Sen-ate fail to complete a vote before the session “ended.” At 12:48 a.m. central time, Mike Ward, a state politics reporter and blogger for the Austin American-Statesman spe-cializing in the Texas Senate, reported on Twitter that the Senate was still in session. 
Later that morning, Lt. Gov. David De-
whurst announced the bill had died. 
About 180,000 people watched a stream 
of the Senate on Youtube. Twitter and Tumblr were far more concerned with the proceedings than traditional broadcast me-dia outlets were.
Multiple times I checked NBC, ABC, 
CBS, CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, CNBC, HLN, a local news station and even Fox News for anything. There was almost noth-ing on this, on Senators Davis and Van de Putte. I heard about this on Tumblr. I had to download an outdated program from an outdated website to watch this for six hours.
This was incredibly compelling for ev-
ery side of the debate. We had heroes and villains made before our eyes. That it was not broadcast to a larger audience is sick-ening.
At the same time, some of this was really 
amazing. I was able to interact with many people, those my age and those younger and older, via the streams and chat rooms. Tuesday, regardless of the initial result, was inspiring.
Davis and Van de Putte became Internet 
sensations, but they transcended that. In the eyes of many, they are what a true poli-tician should be in the most ideal of senses: a conduit through which people may fun-nel their voices so they may be heard by a government that would blatantly try to silence them.

Making a concrete canoe 
float may sound impossible 
— but Gators did it.
Members of UF’s chapter 
of the American Society of Civil Engineers placed third in the ASCE National Con-crete Canoe Competition last month.
After placing first at the 
regional competition in March, 15 UF students and one faculty adviser headed to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign June 20 22 to compete against 22 other teams at nationals. 
The team was judged on 
race results, a technical de-sign paper, an oral presenta-tion and the final product. 
“The goal was to make 
the canoe weigh less than the water,” said 23-year-old UF alumna and team captain Ju-lia Focaracci. 
Concrete is typically made 
from stone or sand mixed with water. To make the ca-noe lighter, the team substi-tuted the stone and sand with materials such as tiny glass spheres and fly ash.
“The unit weight of water 
is 62 pounds per cubic foot,” Focaracci said. “Typical con-crete weighs 150 pounds per cubic foot. Our concrete was five pounds per cubic foot.”Their technique utilized 
cutting-edge concrete tech-nology, said 22-year-old civil engineering senior and UF chapter president Andrew Schwarz.
The team began its jour-
ney last August, he said. It recruited new members and designed the concrete and the mold. They built the first canoe in December and then practiced with it at Lake Wauburg to figure out its strengths and weaknesses.
The fine-tuned design was 
built in January. They began practicing with the canoe at the lake, putting in about 700 hours of paddling practice before the national competi-tion.
“This year’s canoe was 
longer and featured more rocker in the bow and stern,  which helped with turn-ing,” Focaracci said. “It also featured four structural ‘U’-shaped ribs of concrete on the inside of the canoe, which made it stronger.”
Each team painted its ca-
noe according to a chosen theme. 
“We chose ‘Conquista-
Gator,’” Schwarz said, “to commemorate the 500th an-niversary of Ponce de Leon discovering Florida.”
The 21.7-foot canoe 
weighed more than 160 pounds. 
It cost $4,000 and took 
more than 3,500 hours to make. The team paid another $7,000 for food, travel, hotel and entry fees. All the money came from private fundrais-ing and donations.
The team earned a trophy 
and a $1,500 scholarship for placing third overall. 
“To place in the top five 
at Concrete Canoe is such an incredible feeling,” Focaracci said, “and such a great expe-rience for learning.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 2, 2013

Designer fashion may soon be a little 
easier to find in Gainesville.
The first tenant in a Butler Plaza build-
ing will be a Lilly Pulitzer signature store, 
Pink Narcissus. 
The store will move into The Shoppes 
at Butler Plaza, 3730 SW Archer Road — the space Floor Trader used to occupy.
Danny Quinton, the owner of Pink 
Narcissus, said the store will open the last week of July and will hold a grand opening party in August, according to a press release.
Marketing Associate for Butler Enter-
prises Kristin Mamula wrote in an email that the store will target a market that other, nearby stores don’t reach. 
“Pink Narcissus looks forward to 
serve both the local and collegiate clients, as well as those visiting Gainesville,” Ma-mula said. “They offer a distinctive brand that is not offered anywhere else in Butler Plaza.”
Angelica Marino, a 19-year-old UF 
public relations junior, said she knows many women who will be enthusiastic about the opening because the store’s clothing often reaches members of the Greek community. 
“I think she will get really good busi-
ness here because Greek life is a majority of UF population,” Marino said.Lilly Pulitzer

Silk kites representing the sails of Spanish ships are 
now on display at UF.
“Winds of Change,” a summer program that is part of 
Creative B, will run until Sept. 23. The kites can be found 
at the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art, the UF College of Engineering and the UF Health Cancer Center, said Jes-sica Hurov, the public relations and marketing manager for the UF College of Fine Arts.Lucinda Lavelli, dean of the College of Fine Arts, 
wrote in an email that the idea for the exhibit came from Viva Florida 500, the 500th anniversary of Juan Ponce de Leon’s arrival on Florida’s east coast.
She said the kites were designed by Tim Elverston and 
Ruth Whiting, the latter of whom is a UF alumna. The kites serve as a metaphor for the sails of the Spanish ships.
“The exhibit also embraces the idea that kites are a 
form of art and can be beautiful,” Lavelli said.
The exhibit at UF Health Cancer Center will be on dis-
play until Aug. 17, and the kites will be installed at the UF New Engineering Building starting June 27 and will be on display until Sept. 26, according to the UF Creative B calendar. She said the public art program is funded pri-vately through the Office of the Provost and not through state dollars.
It is free to visit the exhibit at all locations.Kites inspired by Ponce de Leon now sailing away at the HarnLoCAL

Eight lives now hang on the wall in 
the Reitz Union stairwell.
They’re displayed in the form of quilt 
squares created by families and friends 
of deceased AIDS victims to show the world who they were and what they meant to them.
Five more quilts hang on the walls 
of the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art, leased to UF by the NAMES Project Foundation that acts as a caretaker of the quilts.
Jarrod Cruz-Stipsits, director of in-
tercultural engagement for UF Multicul-tural & Diversity Affairs, said bringing the quilts to UF was the Pride Student Union’s idea. After consulting Cruz-Stipsits, Pride decided to join the display with this year’s Common Reading Pro-gram book, “A School for My Village: A Promise to the Orphans of Nyaka.”
“There are all these statistics of peo-
ple living with AIDS,” Cruz-Stipsits said. “The quilt brings a human face to those statistics.”
Goodbye messages are scribbled on 
some in pen and marker, while some squares only hold a picture of the de-ceased and a name along with a rain-bow.
“...it forces you to stop and think 
about it, you know?” said Maylen San-tana, a 17-year-old UF chemistry fresh-man. 
Cruz said the quilt in the Reitz Union 
will stay until Sept. 15, but the five in the Harn museum will leave Sept. 8.
Hosts of the quilts have to make 
their own eight-block section to return to the NAMES foundation, he said, and he hopes students and faculty will help create a UF-specific submission.Quilts displayed on campus ensure AIDS patients live on

World of Beer guests buzzed answers into 
their smartphones Monday for the pub’s first 
trivia night.
The event was hosted by Jay Anderson, the 
morning talk show host for The Sky 97.3, from 7-9 p.m. in Newberry’s Tioga Town Center. 
Instead of using pen and paper, players 
downloaded the SpeedQuizzing Smartphone Pub Quiz application and used their smart-phones as answer pads, Anderson said. 
The answer pads changed depending on 
the type of questions and allowed competi-tors to hear sounds and see pictures pertain-ing to questions.
The application eliminated the possibility 
of cheating because of its time constraint, said Kerry Brock, the World of Beer general man-ager. 
Players received 15 seconds to respond to 
most questions — barely enough time to log out of the application and Google an answer, Brock said.
The computer system gave the host the 
ability to score questions and tell who was in the lead. It also allowed him to award bonus points to players who answered the fastest.
Winners received $25, $15 and $10 gift cards, Brock said.
The pub is aiming to be the type of place 
where people come for activities, Brock said. Trivia night was something guests requested, he said, so the pub decided to give it a try.
Anderson said the restaurant plans to hold 
more trivia nights in the future. 
“Hopefully after a month we’ll have a 
lot of folks coming there,” Anderson said. “Hopefully we’ll be doing it for a long, long time.” Tioga World of Beer hosts first smartphone trivia night  “...it forces you to stop and

STARKE — Church steeples 
along roads and a Ten Command-
ments mounment at the courthouse were among the most apparent re-ligious symbols of Starke — until Saturday afternoon, that is.
That’s when another symbol 
joined the predominantly Bap-tist town 30 miles northeast of Gainesville: the first atheist-spon-sored monument erected on govern-ment property in the U.S., according to the American Atheists group.
Under cloudy skies, about 300 
people pressed in front of the Brad-ford County Courthouse to witness the unveiling of the monument: a four-foot-tall granite pillar with a bench attached bearing inscriptions of quotes from famous atheists.
Although Bradford County 
Commissioner Danny Riddick, who opened the ceremony, didn’t specifically express approval of the monument, he emphasized the op-portunity to ask questions.
“By having both monuments side 
by side, I hope [visitors can] search [the] context of both and find their true meanings,” he said. “This is the most important decision a person can make: ‘What to do with God?’”
When Riddick read a Bible verse 
that included “serve the Lord,” someone in the crowd yelled, “serve nobody!”
The clash of ideas first came to 
light in Starke when New Jersey-based nonprofit American Atheists, along with a local resident, sued the county in 2005 for a lighted cross that used to perch on top of a water tower. It was removed in 2007. 
Then, in 2012, a local Christian 
men’s group paid about $20,000 to install the Ten Commandments monument at the courthouse, ac-cording to American Atheists.
It caught the attention of the 
group and sparked a lawsuit, which led to a series of negotiations with Bradford County government, which ended in the agreement to erect a second monument present-ing an alternative viewpoint.
For many, the monument is an 
issue of regional identity.
With a Southern cross flag in 
hand, 20-year-old Marshall Raw-son said the new monument is dis-respectful to the region’s heritage because it is “imposing Northern ideas” — such as a broader defini-tion of morality — on an area that may not be rooted in the same val-ues. He explained how the flag he held was the type flown over the capitol post-Civil War during An-drew Jackson’s presidency.
“Our push is to preserve our 
Southern heritage,” he said. “Every nation should have a cultural iden-tity.”
However, Bridget Gaudette, a lo-
cal activist and a director for Foun-dation Beyond Belief who also spoke during the ceremony, said the mon-ument does represent the ideals of a segment of the local population.
She said the willingness of Amer-
ican Atheists to draw attention to the Starke courthouse helped other local atheists who had been quiet about their beliefs to organize.
“With the weight of a national 
organization behind them, they were more willing to step forward,” she said.
Daniel Cooney, who filed the 
lawsuit against the courthouse, was one. He stepped up to the lec-tern wearing a camouflage ball cap and cargo shirt with the sleeves rolled up. When Cooney wanted to combat the Ten Commandments monument, he lacked the resources to speak up on his own, so he said he had to “find...a friend with a big stick.” He found that friend in American Atheists.
The speeches during the dedica-
tion ceremony were punctuated by blasts from semi truck horns.
That’s because Patti Hinds, the 
owner of two businesses that share office space opposite the courthouse, stood across the street with a group of about 10 people holding signs made of file folders that said “Honk for Jesus,” written in marker.
Gospel music blared from the 
stereo of a green Chevy Silverado parked on the curb.
Although Hinds said she thought 
it important to protest, she said the new monument probably won’t have a lasting impact.
“I think it’s just people kicking 
and screaming,” she said.
President of American Atheists 
Dave Silverman closed the ceremo-ny, saying the historic code is the definition of hate speech because it invokes violence on those who don’t follow it. He then condemned the penalties associated with breaking the Ten Commandments. The athe-ist monument, he said, represents ideals without underlying threats.
And then someone pulled the 
red cloth from the monument.
As people crowded around the 
monument to take photos, Cana-dian evangelist Sye Ten Bruggen-cate climbed on top of the bench. He set down a plastic toilet seat and a roll of toilet paper and declared the monument was complete.
Spurred on by an angry crowd, 
a bystander hurled the roll of toilet paper away and also tried to snatch the toilet seat. Ten Bruggencate climbed down and tucked the toilet seat under his arm.
“I think we have to engage people 
rationally,” he said. “It was a joke, but it exposed their intolerance.”
Bradford County Sheriff Gordon 
Smith, who attended the ceremony out of uniform, said he didn’t rec-ognize any of the outspoken evan-gelicals at the event. Most, he said, had already come to terms with the monument and allowed it to be un-veiled peacefully.
After Ten Bruggencate stood on 
the monument, the bench began sliding out of place. A deputy roped off a small area surrounding it with yellow crime-scene tape and orange traffic cones. Smith said the accident happened because the grout hold-ing the monument together hadn’t fully hardened.
“This thing started sliding, and 
I said ‘Oh, Lord,’” he said with a chuckle.
Although American Atheists as-
serted it will continue to erect simi-
lar monuments across the country, the Rev. Les Singleton, of Micanopy, said he thinks the situation in Starke was handled with a good compro-mise.
“It’s probably a satisfactory reso-
lution to put something alongside instead of removing,” he said. 
But he said the Starke monument 
will have limited impact.
“I’d be surprised if it’s more than 
a blip in the news,” he said. “I think it’s a hiccup.”

Party 99.5 has been dropping the bass on Gainesville 
for a month, but some listeners are still adjusting to the 
loss of conservative talk radio to electronic dance music.
At midnight May 31, The Star 99.5 WBXY-FM 
switched to an electronic dance music format, sending “Talk of the Town,” a local political talk show, to the In-ternet. The show went off the air and online after JVC Broadcasting of Long Island, N.Y., bought five Gaines-ville-area FM stations.
Jake Fuller and Ward Scott, co-hosts of “Talk of the 
Town,” can now be heard on www.alachuatalks.com or by tuning in to the station through the Live365 app on mobile devices.
“We don’t want any dead air time,” Scott said. “We 
want to be out there somehow with our voice in the com-munity. If it comes from the Internet, then so be it.”
But Fuller said the transition has been a challenge, 
especially for attracting advertisers.
Because most of the political show’s listeners are 
older voters in the community, Fuller said it has been difficult for fans to adjust to the new technology.
Despite the obstacles, Fuller said he still believes in 
talk radio.
“We’ve done a pretty good job at getting local issues 
out,” Fuller said. “We’ve filled in a lot of gaps as far as information goes for the public.”
Although Fuller and Scott said there are things they 
miss about the radio format, having the show online has lifted Federal Communications Commission restrictions, creating a freer working environment.
While Scott said “Talk of the Town” is more in touch 
with the community than the electronic music, JVC Broadcasting CEO John Caracciolo said the changes have the community in mind.
“We have two locations picked out, and we are work-
ing with a local architect and contractor to develop and design a very cool-looking on-air facility that makes the station part of the fabric of the community,” he wrote in an email.
Caracciolo said the station was 
previously 80 percent automated with syndicated shows.
“We are adding local staff and cre-
ating local jobs,” he said.
For “Talk of the Town,” Caracciolo 
said he knows losing the talk format 
upset some members of the public, but the online podcast could still be successful.
“Internet formats work great with specialty program-
ming that you can’t get on the AM or FM dial,” he said. “Internet stations are usually geared towards a small core audience of followers that love the programming.”
Caracciolo said that ultimately, switching to electron-
ic dance music was the right choice.
“Radio is supposed to be local, fun and exciting. This 
format serves a very influential consumer in this mar-ket, so it’s good for the listeners, and it’s good for local business owners that need to reach and speak to those consumers,” he said. “This station is a new voice for a community of several thousand, and that’s always a good thing.”TUESDAY, JULY 2, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 11

A Gainesville man was ar-

he held his girlfriend against her will at the Bambi Motel.
Michael Farris Perry, 46, and 
his girlfriend of five months, Brenda Lynn Jenkins Plowden, were staying in a room at the motel. Plowden wanted to leave the room, according to the report, but when she got up, Perry grabbed her arms, pushed her onto the bed and held her down.
She said he hit the side of 
her head several times with his open hand. She tried to leave the room about three times, and the last time, she said, he squeezed her neck, according to the report.
When Gainesville Police ar-
rested Perry, they found mari-juana on him, according to the report. He was taken to the Ala-chua County Jail and booked with charges of domestic bat-tery by strangulation, simple battery/dating violence, false imprisonment and possession of less than 20 grams of can-nabis.
Perry told officers he didn’t 
touch her and that she wanted to be in the room. As of press time, he remained in jail with bond set at $47,000.

Theresa Duffy is a 62-year-old woman 
who doesn’t take any medication and rarely 
gets sick. She said she hasn’t sat in a doctor’s office in seven years.
What’s her secret?Duffy is a certified ThetaHealer at the Sa-
cred Earth Center.
Located at 1029 NW 23rd Ave., the center 
held its June Mini Healing and Psychic Fair on Saturday.
This interfaith church and healing center 
provides training for spiritual healers and ministers. It also offers psychic readings, healings, massage therapy and acupuncture. The cost ranges from about $20 to $40 de-pending on service and time limit.
Duffy sat in her room Saturday afternoon 
next to a nightstand with a plaque that read “We create our tomorrows by what we dream today,” which was fitting because ThetaHeal-ings deal with the subconscious.
“It’s the most fascinating thing I’ve ever 
done in my life,” Duffy said.
ThetaHealing is done from a theta brain-
wave state. She said she doesn’t need to touch her clients while conducting the healing, which means it can be done over the phone or through Skype.
In her sessions, Duffy and the client de-
cide if they are going to change a belief sys-tem or release an emotion. If Duffy and the client agree on releasing anger, for example, she asks the client: “Do I have your permis-sion to have the creator of all that is release all anger from all of your bodies and replace it with divine love for your highest and best good on all levels?”The client usually responds by saying 
“yes,” and then shuts his or her eyes and finds center within. Duffy also shuts her eyes and goes into a theta brainwave state. While in this state, Duffy shakes, coughs and gags.
When Duffy and the client open their eyes, 
the client says if he or she felt any changes. She said some clients feel changes in energy, feel more relaxed, see colors or hear voices. Duffy said she does this repeatedly, wher-ever the spirits guide her, until she feels the session is over. 
She said after the session, 
her clients look like they just came from a massage. She described their faces as “beautiful and sweet.”
“They’re transformed,” 
she said. “Their bodies are relaxed. Their attitudes are relaxed. Their faces are re-
laxed.”
Duffy said she enjoys seeing people’s lives 
altered after her services — whether it’s al-leviating a woman’s pain from scoliosis or helping someone move on in life.
Like Duffy, Maria Minno also enjoys help-
ing people through her work at the Sacred Earth Center. The 58-year-old specializes in psychic analysis. She includes nutritional therapy and herbs into her practices. 
For Minno, the center is a haven for people 
who have psychic abilities. 
When she started working at the center, 
she said it felt good to find a place where she belonged.
“This is a really good, safe place for peo-
ple who like to talk about and practice these things that aren’t generally accepted,” she said.Psychic aims to relax, help visitors

Wambach sets international record
Former UF striker Abby Wambach set the international

  On Thursday night, Erik Murphy landed 
with a 2013-14 NBA title contender.
  The Chicago Bulls selected the former Gators power forward with the 49th pick in 
the second round of the NBA Draft. 
  “Obviously, it’s a great organization. 
Great coaches, great people here,” Murphy said during Chicago’s’ introductory press conference Monday.  “It’s in a great sports city, so it’s just an 
honor to be here honestly.”
  Murphy joins All-Star center Joakim 
Noah, who won two national titles with Flor-ida from 2005-07.
    Murphy said a ﬁ  red-up Noah called him 
after the draft was completed. 
  “He was real excited, as was I. We were 
just talking back and forth,” Murphy said.
  “Obviously, it’s nice to know a guy on the 
team.”
  Because Chicago retired Scottie Pippen’s 
No. 33, Murphy will wear No. 31 with the Bulls instead of the number he wore with the Gators. He will begin workouts this week and will play on the Chicago’s NBA summer league squad, starting July 13 in Las Vegas.
  He is the 35th Florida player to be selected 
in the history of the draft and 17th player drafted during coach Billy Donovan’s 17-year tenure at Florida.
  Murphy was the only Gator selected in 
this year’s draft. Former UF guards Kenny Boynton and Mike Rosario, two of Florida’s top three scorers in 2012-13, went undrafted Thursday. Neither has signed with an NBA team. 
  The 6-foot-10 Murphy ﬁ  lls Chigaco’s need 
for a forward who can stretch the ﬂ  oor. He showcased his perimeter game last season, shooting 45.3 percent from behind the arc and leading the Southeastern Conference in three-point shooting percentage (.473) dur-ing league play. He averaged 12.2 points per game – second most for Florida.
  In 2012-13, Chicago shot 35.3 percent from 
downtown – 20th in the NBA.
  “One of the things we were trying to do is 
improve our ability to shoot the ball from the perimeter,” Chicago general manager Gar Forman said.   “We really haven’t had a guy who’s a 
stretch four. And we think as [Murphy] con-tinues to progress, he’ll give us an ability to space the ﬂ  oor.”
  The Bulls selected New Mexico forward 
Tony Snell with the 20th overall pick Thurs-day night. Murphy joins Noah, Snell, power forwards Carlos Boozer, Taj Gibson and small forward Luol Deng in the frontcourt. 
  According to multiple reports, the Bulls 
are also expected to re-sign backup center Nazr Mohammed. 
  Last season, the Chicago Bulls went 45-37 
and fell to the NBA champion Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference semiﬁ  nals in ﬁ  ve games.
  Tyus back in Israel: Former Gators for-
ward Alex Tyus signed a two-year deal with Maccabi Tel Aviv, the club announced Mon-day.
  The 25-year-old Tyus returns to Israel, 
where he played his ﬁ  rst season overseas with Maccabi Ashdod in 2011-12.
  Last year, Tyus played for Pallancanestro 
Cantu in Italy – a Euroleague squad – where he averaged 8.1 points and 3.7 rebounds in 10 contests. He helped Cantu win the Italian Basketball Supercup in 2012-13. 
  Tyus averaged 11.1 points and 6.4 re-
bounds during his three seasons as a starter at Florida. As a senior in 2010-11, he helped lead the Gators to their ﬁ  rst of three consecu-tive Elite Eight appearances.

  It’s the best of times and the worst of times in 
Gainesville.
  If you’re a freshman, it’s the best of times. You’re 
on your own for the ﬁ  rst time and you ﬁ  nally are getting the chance to pursue an education that interests you. No more math or English classes if you don’t want them.
  If you’re a returning student, it’s the worst of times. 
Few, if any, of your friends are in town. You’re long-ing for a time when you can go outside without being drenched in either rain or sweat (or both), and there are freshmen everywhere.
  It’s Summer B in Gainesville.  For those of you new to the Alligator, we exclu-
sively cover UF sports. And as July drags on into Au-gust, there’s a distinct lack of college competition. Base-ball season ended last month and football is still three months away.
  So why check out the sports section?   We’re here to keep you informed about anything and 
everything happening in UF athletics. You never know when another football player is going to be arrested (see right).
  Summer B is a unique semester. Is it the start of a new 
academic year the end of the last one? 
  We would like to strike a balance between the two. We’re going to review what happened last year with our annual Alligator Awards, re-capping the best and worst of Gators sports.
  We’ll also try to preview 
the upcoming fall sports so you can be informed not only about football and basketball, but also smaller sports like 
soccer and volleyball.
  A lot of freshmen attend Summer B to get a head start 
on academics and the college experience. Sports, espe-cially football, are an integral part of college life.
  In addition to covering any and all news that hap-
pens in the next six weeks, we’ll do our best to educate new students on what they need to know about Florida sports. Who’s important, what you should do and what you should watch for. At least once every week, we’ll have a “What to Expect” column with information about teams, players and coaches.
  That way, you can school all the upperclassmen who 
come back after three months of lounging at home.

  Gainesville Police arrested 
a UF football player early Sat-
urday morning.
  Grant Van Aman, a walk-on 
punter, was charged with driv-ing under the inﬂ  uence on his scooter after he ran a stop sign, according to a police report.
  Van Aman swerved and 
nearly fell off his scooter before righting himself, according to the police report.
  According to the report, 
Van Aman refused to submit to a ﬁ  eld sobriety test, but when he was asked to read the implied consent statement on his wallet, he “slurred his words and then told [the ofﬁ  -cer] that he didn’t know what that means.”
  Van Aman 
walked on to the Florida football team last year after he graduated from Tampa Plant High School. He 
set a school record with 11 ﬁ  eld goals in a season, but never got into a game at UF.
  Florida coach Will Mus-
champ has not announced any team action against Van Aman.

  ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) — A second 
man was taken into custody in connec-
tion with the murder charge against for-mer New England Patriots tight end Aar-on Hernandez in the shooting death of one of his friends. 
Meanwhile, relatives of the victim pre-
pared for his funeral.
  Two men who authorities say were in 
a car with Hernandez before one of his friends was shot to death are in custody. On Friday, one was charged with illegally carrying a gun and the other accused of being an accessory after murder.
  Hernandez was charged with murder 
last week, and prosecutors haven’t said who ﬁ  red the shots that killed his friend Odin Lloyd, a Boston semi-pro football player.
  Amid the ﬂ  urry of activity in the courts, 
Lloyd’s relatives prepared for his funeral in Boston on Saturday. 
  Lloyd played for the Boston Bandits 
and was dating the sister of Hernandez’s ﬁ  ancee.
  Carlos Ortiz, who was arrested in Con-
necticut but was transferred to Massachu-setts to face the gun charge, and Ernest Wallace, who walked into a South Florida police station to surrender, were identiﬁ  ed earlier as being with Hernandez and Lloyd the night of his shooting death, a prosecu-tor said.
  Ortiz was charged Friday with carry-
ing an unlicensed ﬁ  rearm in North Attle-borough on June 17, the day Lloyd was found shot to death near Hernandez’s home there. Details of the charge weren’t released.
  Wallace, whose wanted poster was re-
leased Thursday night, surrendered in Miramar, Fla., police said. Authorities had been seeking Wallace on a charge of act-ing as an accessory after Lloyd’s murder. Details of that allegation also weren’t re-leased.
  Police arrested Hernandez on Wednes-
day at his home and charged him with orchestrating Lloyd’s execution-style shooting. Prosecutors said Hernandez or-chestrated the killing because Lloyd talked to the wrong people at a nightclub.
  Hernandez, Ortiz and Wallace were in 
a Nissan Altima with Lloyd shortly before his death, Bristol County, Mass., District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter said.
  “We now have in custody the three in-
dividuals who were in the silver Nissan Altima,” Sutter said Friday when Ortiz was arraigned on the gun charge in Attle-boro District Court.
  All three men have ties to Bristol, Conn.: 
Hernandez grew up there, Ortiz had been living there and authorities had conﬂ  icting addresses for Wallace there and in Mira-mar.
  Hernandez pleaded not guilty to mur-
der and was denied bail Thursday. Ortiz also was being held without bail pending a court hearing on July 9. Wallace was taken to a jail in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., pending extradition proceedings, police said.
  Hernandez’s lawyer argued in court 
that the case is circumstantial. He said Hernandez, who was cut by the Patriots the day he was arrested, wanted to clear his name.
  Ortiz’s attorney, John Connors, said 
he will seek bail for his client at the July 9 hearing. He described Ortiz as a “gentle person” and said he will advise Ortiz to plead not guilty.
  “I can say that his charge has nothing to 
do with homicide,” Connors said.
  Wallace walked into 
the police station and told ofﬁ  cers there was a warrant for his arrest, which ofﬁ  cers conﬁ  rmed by checking a computer database.
  “He stated he knew he 
had a warrant because he 
saw himself on TV,” Miramar police Ofﬁ  -cer Gil Bueno said. “He was very coopera-tive. It was uneventful.”
  An attorney for Wallace, David Meier, 
told The Boston Globe that his client was visiting his mother and other relatives in Miramar when he realized he was wanted in Massachusetts and went to police. Meier said Wallace intends to return to Massa-chusetts “as soon as possible.”
  Earlier Friday, Ortiz appeared in Bris-
tol Superior Court in Connecticut, where a judge authorized turning him over to a Massachusetts state trooper and a North Attleborough ofﬁ  cer.
  A friend and a relative of Ortiz said 
outside the courthouse that they were stunned by his arrest. They said Ortiz is the devoted father of two girls and a boy, all under the age of 9. Ortiz was unem-ployed recently but previously worked a long time at a Savers clothing store, they said.
  They also said they couldn’t believe Or-
tiz could be part of a murder.
  “He’s not that type of person. He has 
a good heart,” said friend Milton Mon-tesdeoca, who added he didn’t know Her-nandez and never heard Ortiz talk about the football star.
  Also Friday, authorities said law en-
forcement ofﬁ  cers recovered in Bristol a car Wallace was seen driving before he surrendered.
  Authorities have said trouble that led 
to Lloyd’s killing happened June 14, when Lloyd went with Hernandez to a Boston nightclub. Hernandez became upset when Lloyd began talking with people Hernan-dez apparently didn’t like, prosecutors said.
  On June 16, the night before the slaying, 
a prosecutor said, Hernandez texted two unidentiﬁ  ed friends and asked them to hurry to Massachusetts from Connecticut.
  A few minutes later, he texted Lloyd to 
tell him he wanted to get together, pros-ecutors said. Authorities say the three men picked up Lloyd at around 2:30 a.m. June 17, drove him to an industrial park near Hernandez’s home and shot him ﬁ  ve times.
  Prosecutors said an ammunition clip 
was found in Hernandez’s Hummer and matched the caliber of casings found at the scene of Lloyd’s killing.
  Hernandez, who was drafted by the Pa-
triots in 2010 and signed a ﬁ  ve-year con-tract worth $40 million last summer, could face life in prison if convicted.

While Billy Donovan’s USA U19 
squad cruised to victory on Monday, 
Gators shooting guard Michael Frazier had a game to forget. 
USA (4-0) defeated Brazil (1-3) 91-
66, but Frazier scored only five points on 2-of-12 shooting and a 1-of-9 clip from three-point range in the second round of the FIBA U19 World Champi-onships in Prague. 
Frazier went 0 for 5 from beyond the 
arc during the first half, which USA fin-ished with a 40-34 lead. 
Despite the off performance, Frazier 
remained optimistic. 
“The ball just didn’t go in. Some-
times it happens,” he said. “But as a shooter, you’ve got to keep shooting. You have to understand you’re not get-ting that day back. I’m not getting it back, so I just have to move forward.”
In four games off the bench, Frazier 
has averaged 8.5 points on 28.9 percent shooting in 19.8 minutes per contest. He has made only 7 of 32 three-point attempts. 
“My teammates are doing a great 
job of finding me. They’re finding me, I’m wide open, but I’m missing,” Fra-zier said. 
“I’m just going to keep shooting 
and, hopefully, the ball starts falling.”
Although his shooting percentage in 
tournament play is low, Frazier pieced together two strong performances on Friday and Saturday.
Frazier’s highlight of the World 
Championships came during USA’s 113-57 win against China on Friday. During the victory, Frazier scored 15 points – second most on the team – on 5-of-13 shooting. He drained 4 of his 11 attempts from behind the arc. 
The next day, he recorded 12 points, 
three rebounds and two assists against Russia.
Frazier said playing under Donovan 
has made the transition into tourna-ment play smoother. During the past few weeks, Frazier said aspects of his game, such as his court awareness, have improved because of playing with elevated competition. 
“It helps a tremendous amount be-
cause I know the system that we’re run-ning,” Frazier said. “I know the offense, the defensive schemes, everything – the same thing we run at Florida.
“[Donovan] adapts to the system 
according to his players. We have a very athletic team, so we press more than we do at Florida because we have a group of guys who are very athletic that can get up and down and get out in transition, get in passing lanes. … So he really takes advantage of that.” 
USA plays Australia (2-2) today at 
2:15 p.m. EST. The quarterfinals begin Friday, with tournament action ending Sunday.

to keep shooting. You have to 
understand you’re not getting 
that day back. I’m not getting 
it back, so I just have to move 
forward.”

Florida pitcher Johnny Magliozzi became 
the fourth Gator to sign with a professional 
team when he signed a contract with the New York Mets on June 25.
The UF sophomore was selected in the 17th 
round (506th overall) in the MLB First-Year Player Draft after he led the Gators with a 2.67 ERA.
Magliozzi will begin his pro career with 
the Brooklyn Cyclones of the New York-Penn League – the Mets’ short-season Class A affili-ate.
Magliozzi will join two other former Gators 
in the NYPL. 
Former Florida ace Jonathon Crawford was 
assigned to the Connecticut Tigers after Detroit took him 20th overall in the draft.
Crawford has started two games for Con-
necticut, pitching five innings and allowing one unearned run. He has struck out seven bat-ters without issuing a walk.
Cody Dent also plays 
in the NYPL. He was as-signed to the Auburn Doubledays – the affiliate 
of Washington Nationals.
Despite Dent’s struggles on offense in 
Gainesville, he has seen early success in Au-burn. The infielder is hitting .333 in eight games with the Doubledays, racking up nine hits in 27 at-bats.
Elsewhere in the minor leagues, two other 
former Gators have seen mixed results.
Pitcher Daniel Gibson was assigned to the 
Hillsboro Hops, the Arizona Diamondback’s affiliate in the Northwest League.
Gibson has made three appearances for the 
Hops, all in relief. He struck out five batters in 4.2 innings while surrendering three unearned runs.
Infielder Taylor Ratliff was also drafted by 
the Diamondbacks and assigned to the Hops, but he has had a tougher transition.
Ratliff is batting .222 with 10 hits in 45 at-
bats. Ratliff did not play for Florida in 2013. 
He sat out the season after transferring from 
Jacksonville University before Arizona drafted him in June.
The only Gator who was drafted and has 
not signed with a pro team is Karsten Whitson. The Nationals selected the junior pitcher in the 37th round. Whitson has until July 15 to sign with Washington.

200-pound shooting guard out of Arlington Country Day School in Jacksonville, verbally committed to Florida on Thursday.
Francis, a four-star recruit, is ranked No. 25 in the Class of 2014, according to Rivals.com.
“Happy to be part of the family 
#GatorNation!!!! I’m so humble and thankful right now.. Thank you…,” Francis posted on his Twitter ac-count (@BFranc5).
Francis picked Florida after also 
considering Florida State, Wash-ington, Louisville, Indiana and others. 
He would be the third Domini-can Republic na-
tive to play for Florida in the past 10 years af-ter Al Horford in 2004-07 and Eloy Vargas in 2008-09.
Although his 
shot selection is an issue, the strong and athletic Francis has good court vision and excels as a passer and slasher. He is also a solid ball-han-dler and perimeter rebounder, ac-cording to scouting reports. 
Francis won MVP in the 17-and-
under division at the Adidas Exclu-sive Run in Dallas in April while playing for his AAU squad, Florida Elite. 
He will rejoin Florida Elite 
when it competes in the Adidas In-vitational in Indianapolis from July 10-14.With point guard Scottie Wil-
bekin graduating after next season, Francis’ commitment solidifies Florida’s backcourt in 2014-15. 
Francis is UF’s second 2014 re-
cruit. On May 14, Donovan picked up a commitment from 5-foot-9 point guard Chris Chiozza, the 39th-ranked player in the class and a Memphis native.
