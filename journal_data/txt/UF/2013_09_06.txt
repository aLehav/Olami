The Woodlands of Gainesville, 
located at 1055 SW 62nd Blvd., re-
mains entrenched in an ongoing le-gal battle with former tenant Zach-ary Arnold and his mother, Michelle 
Arnold.
Arnold, who lived in the com-
plex from when it ﬁ  rst opened in 2008 until 2010, was initially sued by the Woodlands for about $5,600 
because he owed for back rent, late fees and property damage, Patricia Boyes, counsel for the Woodlands, wrote in an email.
In response to those claims, Ar-
nold and his mother, the guarantor on the lease, countersued the Wood-lands, claiming that the complex had 
violated numerous Florida laws.Andy Dogali, the attorney acting 
on behalf of the Arnolds, said the 
Woodlands had not obtained the correct legal licenses to operate while 
Arnold lived there and included 
provisions in the standard lease that didn’t comply with Florida law.
“For roughly the ﬁ  rst four years 
of existence, the Woodlands had no license, and therefore it was unlaw-ful to collect rent,” he said.
Dogali said the solution would 
be for the Woodlands to return all the rent collected from the tenants who lived in the complex during the period of time they did not have 
a license, which he estimates to be about 2,500 tenants.
“It’s an enormous claim,” he said. 
“We’re still not far enough down 
the road that I know precisely how many different tenants have paid rent to them.”
Boyes wrote in an email that at 
the time of opening, the Woodlands had obtained its business occupa-tion license from the city and was

Noise from the area of Gainesville’s new biomass 
plant has become the cause of complaints among 
nearby Whitney Mobile Home Park and Turkey Creek community residents.
Jane Greene lives in Whitney about one mile away 
from the recently opened plant. She said she gets wo-ken up every night at 4 a.m. by “loud, booming crash-es” radiating from the area.
“Here I am in my deep sleep, and next thing I know, 
I’m woken up by the noises,” said Greene, 75.
She made previous complaints to the city, but she 
said no one has been able to offer an explanation for the noise. 
“Before they started building it, no one even came 
here to warn me. They didn’t tell us it was going to happen,” she said.
County Commissioner Robert “Hutch” Hutchinson 
said the county is conducting public works projects in the area, which could account for some of the noise.  
“No regulatory approach will alleviate the noise, 
but I’ve lived in areas with loud noises and there are ways that neighbors can negotiate ways to operate the 
plant at times more suitable,” he said.
He called the issue a jurisdictional one — an issue 
neighbors must take up with the plant’s management.
“I believe if we do enough to point out this issue, 
the Gainesville Renewable Energy Center will do their 
best to alleviate the noise,” he said.
Activist Mark Venzke agreed.
“Hopefully, the complaints citizens have will con-
tinue to register with the managers of the GREC and 
with local environment authorities,” he said.Biomass plant

Two student organizations at UF are 
blurring the lines between a hit summer 
song and the Gator Nation.
Students from the UF Pre-Med 
American Medical Student Associa-
tion, AMSA, uploaded a video entitled “Blurred Lines (Pre-
med Parody) - Univer-sity of Florida” onto YouTube Wednesday evening.
Emphasizing the 
increased academic burden placed on pre-med students and highlighting prob-
lems  in required courses, the parody of the Robin Thicke song had more than 3,000 views by Thursday night.Zachary Field, a 21-year-old UF biol-
ogy senior and a director in the Medical College Forum within AMSA, wrote the lyrics. He said the three ﬁ  lm sessions that went into making the video added up to more than six hours of ﬁ  lm.
“We tried to incorporate every aspect 
of being a pre-med, like the MCAT, or-ganic chem and living at the library,” he said.

Instead, Stubbs the cat is sedat-
ed and under veterinary care after he was badly injured in a vicious dog attack in Talkeetna, a quirky community of 900 that elected him in a write-in campaign 15 years ago. Talkeetna has no human mayor, so you could say 16-year-old Stubbs is the reigning leader — of the feline sort, anyway.
“He’s everybody’s guy,” said 
Stubbs’ owner, Lauri Stec, who manages Nagley’s General Store, where the orangey-beige cat lives and mingles with locals and tour-ists alike. Saturday’s attack left Stubbs with a punctured lung, bruised hips, a long deep gash on his side and a sternum fractured to the point it might need to be re-paired with a plate.
Stec, who said she knows the 
dog that was involved, has report-ed the attack with borough animal control ofﬁ  cials.
The next few days will be cru-
cial in Stubbs’ recovery, but the cat has begun to sit up and eat. A tube inserted in his lung has been removed. All in all, Stubbs is hold-ing his own, Stec said.
“He’s a freaking tough boy,” 
she said.
Stubbs has his own Facebook 
page, ﬁ  lled with posts this week from well-wishers around the world.
Before Saturday, Stubbs had 
already used up a few of his nine lives. In the past, he has been shot by a BB gun, and still has a BB lodged inside. He’s fallen into a cold fryer vat at the West Rib when the staff was changing the oil. He rode on a garbage truck before jumping off.
“He’s a little pistol,” Stec said.

� DEGREE ISN’T THE ONLY 
FACTOR THOUGH. 
CHERI BAILEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Associate degrees and technical certiﬁ  -
cates can earn graduates more in their ﬁ  rst 
year out of college than four-year degrees.
College Measures, a partnership be-
tween the American Institutes for Research 
and Matrix Knowledge Group, used infor-
mation from ﬁ  ve states to collect data on how much graduates earned their ﬁ  rst year after graduation.
The ability to earn higher wages by 
completing certiﬁ  cate programs and tech-nical associate degrees demonstrates a faster, cheaper route into the labor market, according to the report.
Ja’Net Glover, associate director of em-
ployer relations at the Career Resource Center, said there are other factors that earn higher salary jobs out of college.
“Depending on the job at hand, em-
ployers are not only looking to have the knowledge skills and abilities that are re-quired to perform a job,” she said. “They are also looking for a candidate to have 
interpersonal skills, to be able to commu-
nicate and to be professional and represent the organization appropriately.” 
But in the long run, Glover said gener-ally students with four-year degrees and advanced degrees will earn more than stu-dents with two-year degrees.
According to the report, students who 
graduated from “ﬂ  agship campuses” who entered the job market directly after grad-uation did not earn more than graduates of regional college campuses.
Heather Buss, a 22-year-old Associate 
Science in Nursing (ASN) student at Santa Fe College, said she chose to get her associ-ate of the arts ﬁ  rst to lock in a degree her ﬁ  rst two years of college.
“Whether having block degrees such 
as AA, ASN, then BSN shows progress in one’s education or not, I feel as though hu-man resources of medical facilities like to 
see that versus one four-year degree,” she 
said. 
Buss is required to have an amount 
of hours in the lab and clinical setting throughout her program, which she said makes her a stronger candidate for jobs.
Salil Phadnis, a 19-year-old biology 
sophomore, said he chose UF because an associate degree is not an option for his ca-
reer path.
“What I’m trying to do with the four 
years I have here is prepare for med school 
and at the same time get that base of neu-roscience knowledge,” he said. “I haven’t given associate versus bachelor’s much thought because a bachelor’s degree is just one step toward my actual goal.”Some grads earn more soonerCAMPUS

While students across the country have 
been ﬁ  ling complaints against their uni-
versities citing the mishandling of sexual assault cases, UF is working to improve its own sexual assault and harassment education programs.
Dartmouth College; University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley; Swarthmore College and 
Occidental College are among the schools 
currently being audited for their sexual assault policies.
Driving the changes are federal inves-
tigations triggered by multiple student complaints.
On pace with the national movement, 
Chris Loschiavo, a UF program coordina-tor, said he’s working with a university committee to create posters and an infor-mational website that will contain all the information about UF’s policies related to sexual harassment.
UF is also revamping its Sexual Trau-
ma/Interpersonal Violence Education 
program, designed to “educate students 
on interpersonal violence, speciﬁ  cally fo-cusing on sexual harassment,” said Julia Rae Varnes, a spokeswoman at GatorWell Health Promotion Services.
By Fall 2014, GatorWell will launch a 
social marketing campaign related to as-sault. 
The agency will also expand the by-
stander intervention program, which teaches students how to respond if they witness a harassment situation, Varnes said.
Students speaking up is “one of the 
best ways to prevent sexual assault,” she said.
Some national policies that were al-
ready in place are lending support to the direction students and universities are moving toward.
Title IX, a federal law passed in 1972, 
created equal opportunities for men and women in higher education, and the Clery Act outlines regulation for how colleges and universities may count, col-lect and classify crimes, said Alison Kiss, executive director of the Clery Center for Security On Campus.
In Florida, as in many other states, no 
policy exists to require investigation of sexual assault allegations.
“Automatic enforcement may cause 
some victims to be shy,” Loschiavo said.
Instead, he said, UF allows victims 
to decide whether they want their com-plaints pursued.
“There’s always more you can do,” 
said Loschiavo, “but we actually do quite 
a bit.”UF betters harrassment policies
“ A u t o m a t i c  e n f o r c e m e n t                      
m a y  c a u s e  s o m e  v i c t i m s

UF program coordinatorunaware another permit was needed.
After realizing a public lodging li-
cense was needed, the Woodlands paid 
the application fee and received the additional permit, Boyes said. She said 
requiring retroactive rent payback is an 
unrealistic way to make up for a simple paperwork hang-up.
“The law will not condone such an 
extreme punishment,” she said. “Espe-cially since the lack of this permit never endangered any tenant’s health or wel-fare.”
The class-action lawsuit has been 
moving slowly for more than two years, but Dogali said that’s to be expected when filing a claim against a smaller 
company.
“They tend to react a different way,” 
he said. “For that reason, they spent two 
years filing all kinds of motions and liti-gating all kinds of stuff like crazy.”
Dogali said collecting allegations 
is the next step. He’s sent out letters to Woodlands tenants asking them to sub-
mit any evidence that could be used.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2013

Some Gainesville residents doubt the effec-
tiveness of an Alabama-based organization’s 
initiative to give up to $50,000 to Jewish fami-lies who agree to move to a Southern state. The campaign is aimed at preserving Judaism in a region that’s not predominantly Jewish. 
“It doesn’t have a shot,” said Ross Elpren, 
an 18-year-old UF pre-health freshman. “Jews 
might move to southern urban areas like At-
lanta or Miami — a place where they can find a support group — but a little place… no mat-ter how much money they are offering, won’t cut it.”Chelsea Stromfeld, an 18-year-old UF pub-
lic relations freshman, felt the tension first-hand.
“My parents were hesitant about even let-
ting me apply to colleges in the South, because they knew that the Jewish community was weak down here,” she said.
Matti Gorodenchik, a staff member at UF 
Hillel, agreed that Jewish families could be 
reluctant to leave historically Jewish commu-
nities.
“Jewish families now wouldn’t just drop 
everything and go south, no matter how much money is involved,” he said. “If your people have a rich history in an area, you will stay where you are comfortable.”Shalom, y’all: Jewish families offered money to move south

When the renovated Reitz 
Union opens in 2015, it will be 
a little greener than before.
The new building is aim-
ing for platinum Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification, which is 
awarded based on points that 
measure how sustainable a building is.
“[It] was really, really 
challenging, because build-ing a new building obviously could be a lot easier,” said Re-itz Union Executive Director 
Eddie Daniels at a forum last 
week. “But that’s our goal.”
UF can earn points based 
on certain choices during the renovation, Daniels said. One example would be recycling 
during demolition.
More than 75 percent of 
the construction waste will 
be diverted from landfills, 
and more than 30 percent of 
the material used in the new building will be regional 
within 500 miles, according 
to the Make it Reitz web-site. Workers will also install low-flow water fixtures, low-emitting paints and efficient lighting.
This isn’t the first time UF 
has adopted an initiative like this.
UF’s efforts toward green 
building started in 1990, ac-
cording to the university’s 
facilities, planning and con-struction website. The univer-sity has since adopted LEED criteria for all construction 
and renovations.
Three years later, Rinker 
Hall became the first gold 
LEED-certified building in 
Florida, and in 2009, UF was 
named the No. 1 campus for LEED registrations.
As of February, UF had 
40 LEED-certified buildings. 
These include Library West, 
the baseball locker room fa-cility and the Graham Center at Pugh Hall.Reitz Union project

Gainesville Police arrested a 
man Wednesday night after he re-
portedly stabbed another man with a box cutter in the downtown area. 
At about 8 p.m., officers re-
sponded to Bo Diddley Communi-ty Plaza to find Eugene M. Primus, 47, with a 1.5-inch-long cut on the left side of his neck near an artery, according to the report.
Primus told police that 58-year-old Thomas Fred 
Moss, whom Primus referred 
to as “Cowboy,” 
confronted him about a previous argument they had, according to the report. Dur-
ing the fight, Moss pulled out a box cutter and sliced Primus’ neck. 
After identifying Moss as the 
cutter, Primus was taken to UF Health Shands Hospital, according to the report. 
Officers found a bloodstained 
box cutter in Moss’ pocket. 
They interviewed two witness-
es, who confirmed that the fight occurred. One of them told police that Moss said, “I wasn’t messing with nobody, but I had to stab that motherf*****.” 
Officers booked Moss into the 
Alachua County Jail on a charge of attempted murder. As of press 
time, he remained there with a 
$50,000 bond. Gainesville man stabbed by ‘Cowboy’

“It wasn’t political or meant to be taken seri-

Previously, the video was shot at an AMSA 
retreat, said Tara Tavakoli, a 19-year-old UF microbiology and nutrition sophomore and AMSA member, but it was done on a low qual-ity camera.
Field searched on Facebook for a film crew. 
He found the Gainesville branch of Tangible 
Productions, a student-run film organization that originated in Palm Bay, Fla.
Tangible co-founder and branch director 
John Barton, also a 19-year-old UF computer 
engineering sophomore, offered to provide his equipment and editing software to help.
“I enjoyed being able to work collaboratively 
with another student organization,” he said.
The collaboration lasted about two weeks, 
and AMSA worked to include 35 students and campus buildings.
“It’s fun to see parody videos featuring loca-
tions you walk by every day,” said Kyle Willems, a 19-year-old civil engineering sophomore.
The video, which Field said was originally 
created for entertainment, transformed into a promotional advertisement for AMSA.
“It’s just a fun video that we made about life 
as a pre-med student,”  he said.YoUtUbe , from page 1

David Nassau, industry out-
reach director of the club, said he wants to make it an event open to 
the community.
“Reddit is like the front page 
of the Internet, and it has most of 
the newest content right when it 
comes out,” the 19-year-old mar-
keting sophomore said.
Nassau said he is excited about 
Ohanian’s visit to UF and said 
that hearing him talk about start-
ing Reddit will be beneficial and 
inspirational to other students in-terested in starting their own com-panies in this digital age. 
Trevin Baird, a 21-year-old mi-
crobiology junior, said he didn’t 
know Ohanian was visiting UF, but  would attend if he had the 
time.
“I think [Ohanian] will open 
up people’s minds more to how 
much you can do with the Inter-
net in terms of cultural and social 
aspects,” Baird said. “People will 
learn that it can be used for more than just half-minded browsing.”Reddit guru announces college tour — and UF makes front page
� PEOPLE IN WHAT IS THE 
GOOD LIFE? WROTE THEM.
MICHAELA BISIENERE
Alligator Contributing Writer
At Vine Bread and Pasta, locals 
can find a little piece of UF’s fresh-
man class among the baguettes.
The Summer session of the re-
quired humanities course for in-
coming freshmen, What is the Good 
Life?, created a community art in-stallation alongside associate profes-sor in industrial and systems engi-neering Elif Akcali.
On display at Vine, located at 627 
N. Main St., the project is made up of one-word obituaries that students submitted on a piece of paper. The 
project will be displayed until Sept. 
25.
Akcali came up with the idea for 
the project with Jenny Lee, a What is the Good Life? instructor and lectur-er with UF’s Center for Arts in Med-icine in the College of Fine Arts.
The one-word obituary project 
uses the submissions as a piece in 
a mixed-medium display showcase 
made of paper cranes.About 110 students participated 
in the optional assignment, Akcali said.
“I didn’t want this to be forced,” 
Akcali said, “because for some people I think it would be difficult 
enough to write an obituary, let 
alone share part of it with someone that you don’t know.”
Margaret Dukes, a 19-year-old 
health education and behavior sophomore said she thought it was a challenging assignment.
“It’s really hard because I don’t 
think a person can be summarized 
into one word,” Dukes said.
Dukes chose the word “hope.” 
“I think it’s sort of portraying to 
the community that we’re all think-ing about and aware that we only have one life to live,” Dukes said.
Akcali said one of her favorite 
things about the project was the way it highlighted the underlying con-
nection of the human experience.
“I think ‘joy’ was my word,” Ak-
cali said. “There was one other ‘joy,’ 
and that made me smile. Maybe if you see another person who used the same word, you’ll say, ‘Ah, maybe that’s what makes me a hu-man being.’”Student one-word obituaries become art at local bakery“People will learn that it 
can be used for more than 
just half-minded browsing.”

Last weekend, two attendees of New York’s “Elec-
tric Zoo” music festival died from an overdose on molly, the pure form of ecstasy.
In case you’ve been living in a cave for some time, 
demand for the drug has skyrocketed. 
Popularity of the drug is perpetuating the decadence 
of our culture. 
Even worse, it is being endorsed by household 
names.
Despite negative publicity, the electronic dance mu-
sic — commonly known as EDM — community isn’t en-tirely culpable for the new drug of choice among young 
people. 
Other genres of music have provided an outlet for 
those who don’t listen to EDM but still want to experi-
ence dehydration, sweating and heart failure. 
For instance, Miley Cyrus speaks of dancing with 
molly in one of her songs.
Both Trinidad James and Kanye West have refer-
enced the drug in their music. 
Rapper Rick Ross has recently lost endorsements for 
a line he wrote, claiming that he “put molly all in her champagne / she ain’t even know it.”
Aside from an inability to spell, Ricky Rozay’s choice 
of words represents many problems that plague our 
culture, including the fact that we listen to a man who 
calls himself Ricky Rozay.
The lyric represents the increased popularity of a 
drug that, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, can result in loss of consciousness and seizures.
The most troubling implication of Ross’s lyrics, 
however, is an issue that doesn’t get enough attention: rape.
As if the thought of my peers sweating profusely at a 
Madonna concert wasn’t demoralizing, the thought of a popular musician condoning rape is just sad. 
The emergence of rape culture must be combated by our generation, or it will be here to stay.
Don’t believe rape culture 
exists? 
Recall the Steubenville case, 
where two Ohio high school football players were convicted 
of raping a 16-year-old girl.
According to The New York 
Times, many of the student’s peers assisted in the hu-
miliation of the victim, by distributing and sharing pho-tos of her naked body as she slept.
This sad trend isn’t unique to our country. In India, four young men beat and raped a woman on 
a bus last year in New Delhi. 
A report published by ABC News stated that the ver-
dict will arrive next week. 
In addition, harsher punishments have been insti-
tuted for rape in response to a massive uproar across India.
Can we, then, act as the catalyst for such change here 
in the U.S. as in India? 
Of course we can.In a CNN online report, a Montana judge may be re-
tracting his sentence on Stacey Rambold, who was con-
victed of raping her 14-year-old student.
The judge is re-evaluating the legality of the sentenc-
ing after he was publicly scrutinized for only giving the 
self-professed rapist 30 days in jail.
Although this is important, it is only the ﬁ  rst step. 
We must see that it’s not O.K. for musicians to glori-
fy date rape or for popular football players to distribute 
nude photos of a minor. 
We have to re-examine our culture — including the 
music we listen to and the people we respect.

een-themed crap is about to hit every store shelf, while the

Sorry, but it’s impossible to enjoy pumpkin-ﬂ  avored every-

If you haven’t been paying attention to foreign affairs, 
you should be! Yesterday, President Barack Obama met 
with other global leaders at a G-20 summit to discuss the 
much-debated Syria situation. We expect major decisions to unfold in the next few days, so make sure to ﬂ  ip to the news in between commercial breaks during the Miami game to-morrow.
Anyway, here it is: your welcome-to-September-now-
can-you-pass-me-a-cold-one edition of . . .
Darts & Laurels
Thursday, as global leaders met to — we hope — shut 
down Obama’s efforts to resort to military intervention in Syria, Pope Francis spoke up. According to The Associated 
Press, the ever-cool Twitter Pope wrote a letter to the G-20 
host, Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging all leaders to “lay aside the futile pursuit of a military solution” in Syria. For that, we give Pope Francis a that’s-the-way-to-use-your-
papal-powers LAUREL.
Outrage followed a Montana judge’s decision last week 
to sentence Stacey Rambold, the 54-year-old high school teacher who admitted to raping a 14-year-old student who later committed suicide, to only 30 days in jail. The case has 
received national attention, especially as Judge G. Todd 
Baugh, 71, released insane victim-blaming statements — he called the girl “older than her chronological age” and said she was “as much in control of the situation” as Rambold 
was. Now, Baugh claims he misread a state law and believes 
Rambold should serve a minimum of two years in prison.
Wow, way to backpedal. As prosecutors now begin the 
process of contesting the penalty on account of legal er-ror, we give Baugh a time-to-resign-and-disappear-forever 
DART.  
On to brighter news: Diana Nyad broke records this 
week after being the ﬁ  rst person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage. The 64-year-old swimmer cov-
ered 110 miles in 53 hours. In an interview with PBS News 
Hour, Nyad said at one point she basically vomited continu-ously throughout the swim from ingesting so much seawa-ter — whoa. In the interview, she imparted some inspiring thoughts:
“I wanted to swim this endeavor not to just be the athletic 
record. I wanted it to be a lesson for my life that says, be fully engaged. Be so awake and alert and alive every minute of every waking day, because that’s where I had to be for 
these . . . years to get this done.”
So suck it, Bear Grylls! Nyad proves that nature-defying 
badasses come in all ages and sexes, and for that, we’re 
handing her a LAUREL — but only because we can’t per-
sonally high-ﬁ  ve her.
Happy Friday, y’all! And ‘Canes, prepare to be crushed.

Tough questions for Krishna Lunch
Criticizing what we love is never 
easy. It is particularly difficult to criti-
cize a warm-hearted group of people 
who serve healthy and delicious food. 
Krishna Lunch provides great value for its customers, as evidenced by the high demand for their lunch. Many 
of us love their nutritious vegetarian 
meals and appreciate the people who provide it, but we still need to ask some tough questions.  
Why is Krishna able to provide quality meals at $4 or $5 while others cannot? Why is Krishna allowed to 
serve food on campus but other pri-
vate organizations like Burrito Broth-ers cannot? Is there really such thing as a mandatory donation, or is this an oxymoron? Is the cost to the customer 
referred to as a “donation” rather than 
a “price” purely for regulatory rea-sons?
Does Krishna avoid paying some 
taxes, wages or rent? Is it truly volun-teering if the “volunteers” are compen-sated with tuition, room and board? If prices are raised due to increased food 
expenses, then why is it the case that 
“those who eat at Krishna every day are protected from the price hikes”? Does Krishna hurt local, privately owned restaurants near campus?  
If a local church would like to serve 
food on campus, take mandatory do-nations and spread its message, would UF allow it?

UF finance Ph.D. student
Letter to the EditorIt was a typical Saturday morning, and I was drawing with my 
fictional friends — this time it was The Doctor and Donna — when I heard a thump above me.
I ignored it, because I live on the ground floor, and there are 
always abstract noises and toilet flushes emitting from the ceil-
ing. But then a blur suddenly fell outside my window and caught 
my attention. A bird with a red mohawk and black-and-white speckled wings fluttered to the ground. 
Alarmed, I Googled, “What to do with injured bird.” Luckily, 
the National Audubon Society, an American organization that focuses on the conservation of birds, has a guide to help unfor-tunate animals that come in contact with ignorant laymen like me. The guide states when birds fly into the sides of buildings, windows powered by Windex or egg-stealing pigs, they are of-
ten stunned and may die from shock. The guide recommended 
carefully placing the bird in a cardboard box and putting it in a cool place to rest while it regains its senses. 
I frantically ran about my room searching for a box, found a 
TOMS shoe box I thought at least imbued more goodwill than the Nike one, and rushed outside. My next challenge was getting to the bird, as the area outside of my window is fenced off where the air conditioning units stand next to each other in rows like a small Dalek army. 
After attempting to climb the flimsy plastic fence, I convinced 
a maintenance employee to open the gate for me. He watched as I picked up the dazed woodpecker, put it in a box and took it back to my room. I cranked up the air conditioning and placed the bird aside to chill out. 
Honestly, I kind of forgot about it for an hour as I finished 
watching “Doctor Who,” but then I remembered “Ditz,” my ditzy bird. I went to open up the lid to see if he  — She? I don’t know about birds — was still alive, and he sprang out of the box. 
Then, Ditz proceeded to poop on my floor and fly across my 
room, head banging into the interior window.
Oh gosh, I thought, I am not having this bird die in my room 
and it be my fault. But Ditz continued to dart about like a kami-kaze pilot, leaving me to feel unsafe in my own place. 
He ran into one final wall before hopping on the floor behind 
my still-unpacked boxes. So I shuffled on hands and knees, try-ing to catch him, when he started mak-ing woodpecker noises.  
I think he was saying something like, 
“You’ve seen what I can do to a tree. Imagine me doing that to your face.” 
However, I kept my calm and sweet-
ly called to him to get back into the box, so I could save him, and get him out of my room. 
He slipped my grasp several times until I finally brought the 
box down above him, as you do with a bug you don’t want to touch, and slid the lid underneath. 
He protested as I took him outside and set him free on a tree 
branch. He peacefully flew away above the scum-covered pond on a gust of polluted air. I looked on as my lungs swelled with 
pride — and carbon dioxide fumes from a passing bus. 
I have a friend who will stop mid-sentence to pick up trash 
and throw it away. Now, she won’t touch figurative trash, trash 
that belongs in the red bins in hospitals, or trash that is halfway to becoming a part of nature itself, but she does her part to im-prove the environment in some small way. And I have seen her inspire others, including myself, to clean up messes they have not personally made. 
I didn’t build the four-story structure the bird ran into or in-
vent windows, but I did help clean up the mess they made. And hopefully, I have inspired you to do a slightly better version of the same.
Reflecting on the situation, I probably shouldn’t have opened 
the box with the bird in it in my room — I just didn’t think it would recover so quickly. 
If the bird had been anything worse than stunned, I would 
have called for assistance from Silver Springs Animal Park, Eye of the Eagle Wildlife Sanctuary or Alachua County Animal Ser-
vices, whose phone numbers are listed on UF’s Florida Wildlife 
Extension “Frequently Asked Questions” page at www.wec.ufl.edu. 
For more information on how you can help when a bird hits 
a window, check out the National Audubon Society’s page at birds.audubon.org.

The 3DS is one of the best-selling consoles 
of this generation, selling 1.4 million sys-tem units and 11.4 million games in the 
last quarter of the year, according to Nintendo’s internal financial reports. The 3DS has outsold every one of Nintendo’s other consoles, includ-ing the recently released Wii U.
Nintendo made a 
shocking announce-ment last week that caught the Internet and the video-game-play-ing world by surprise. A new handheld will be hitting stores later this fall, and not much later at all. The Nintendo 2DS launches on Oct. 12 as the company’s newest handheld. It will come at a price point of $129.99, the same as Nintendo’s current handheld powerhouse, the 3DS. While the launch of this hardware revision is exciting, it is unclear who this handheld system might be designed for ex-actly — or why it exists at all.
One might ask, with the 3DS still doing ex-
ceedingly well in stores, and the Wii U not do-ing so hot, why release a new handheld rather than push for more home console sales? It is a baffling thing and in some ways leads me to think that Nintendo is abandoning the Wii U. The console has had little to no third-party 
support and limited first-party support by 
way of software.
Sales for the Wii U have been noted as 
“dire” by IGN and other major gaming news 
sites. The console sold only 160,000 units in 
the same quarter as the 3DS and on 390,000 
games. Nintendo, I believe, is letting the Wii 
U die slowly. I think that they are dropping 
the home console market in favor of compet-
ing in the handheld space where they fare 
much better, and that they are focusing more 
on their Japanese market, which has always 
supported them and uses handhelds more 
often than on American audience due to the 
higher availability of public transportation.
Is this the right decision? Possibly. By fo-
cusing on a handheld segment of consoles in 
the range of $100 to $200, Nintendo opens 
themselves to a larger market than the typi-
cal home console market of $300 to $500. The 
lower price point will give them better reach, 
because all people can afford it — not just 
adults. The lower price allows younger kids 
the chance to save their allowance and pur-
chase the device on their own.
Is the 2DS a good decision? I think not. 
The console is a 3DS without the 3-D capabil-
ity of its predecessor. It is also far bigger and 
blockier than any other handhelds of the day. 
A 3DS, an iPhone and an Android all fit into a 
person’s pocket and can be with them on the 
go. The 2DS will have to go inside a purse or 
backpack for easy carrying.
I believe gamers and parents would have 
been much happier to see a 3DS price drop 
to something like $100 or $115 rather than 
see a new console release. Nintendo is still in good shape for the time being, but if the 2DS 
doesn’t do well, then that’ll be two consoles 
in a row that have flopped for the company. 
They’re on thin ice, and I don’t think they 
know it quite yet.

For Quinton Dunbar, No. 12 Florida’s 
matchup with Miami on Saturday at noon in Sun Life Stadium is a homecoming — to a place he could not wait to escape.
Dunbar grew up in Overtown, a poverty-
stricken neighborhood of Miami with a popu-lation that hovers around 10,000. The mean household income in the city is $13,211.99, ac-cording to the latest available census data. 
“Just coming from a community like that, 
the success rate is low,” Dunbar said. “There’s a lot of drugs and a lot of guns. It’s very hard to get out of it.”
Dolphin Expressway and Flagler Street are 
the two main roads that border Overtown. For many, they serve as prison walls. Once you are in, it can be difficult to leave.
But the temptations that limited many of 
Dunbar’s friends growing up never affected him. He gives the credit for his success to his mother, Twanette.
“My mom is a very great parent,” he said. 
“She always kept me on point and made sure 
I didn’t do other things that other kids did.”
Dunbar’s talents on the football field also 
helped pave the way to something better. 
A four-star prospect from Miami Booker 
T. Washington High, the 6-foot-1, 194-pound 
receiver originally committed to Miami after catching 39 passes for 703 yards and seven touchdowns as a junior. 
Upon further consideration, he decided a 
fresh start elsewhere would suit him well. De-spite growing up idolizing Hurricanes play-ers, he chose to attend in-state rival Florida. 
“I just felt like it was the perfect fit for me,” 
Dunbar said. 
“It was a situation to see something new, 
to get out of Miami. Start a new life some-where else.”
During his first two seasons with the 
Gators, Dunbar totaled 50 receptions for 599 yards and six touchdowns. But with UF los-ing its top three receiving threats other than him from 2012, Dunbar is now expected to be 
the anchor of a receiving corps full of promis-
ing, yet inexperienced, talent. 
“He’s become a leader, just how he works 
in practice, I can’t say enough and feel more 
proud of that kid in how he’s grown up,” of-
fensive coordinator Brent Pease said. 
“It’s awesome. How he’s helped younger 
players, how he understands his role and what he wants to bring to the offense and re-
ally understanding that he’s a guy that we 
expect to make plays for us.”
After catching two passes for 22 yards 
during Florida’s 24-6 victory against Toledo 
last weekend, Dunbar is looking to increase 
his production against the Hurricanes.
The matchup will also serve as a measur-ing stick for the progress Florida’s offense has 
made early this season. 
Dating back to last season, Miami’s de-
fense has not allowed a touchdown at home 
since Nov. 1 — a span of 160 minutes and 39 
seconds.
In what will be his first game in Miami 
since leaving his hometown, Dunbar is hop-
ing to leave his mark on what will likely be the final regular-season meeting between 
these two programs for at least the foresee-
able future.
“The first game, we just took what the de-
fense gave us,” Dunbar said. “This week, we 
feel like they’re going to challenge us more. 
They’re going to come up and press. So we’ve got to make the plays.”

Georgia (-3) is glad to be home

That offense is just too damn 
good. The Bulldogs may have fallen in a tough contest against Clemson, but they found the end zone five 
times and racked 545 yards of total

Some players just have “it.” 
Zach Thomas had it during 
his 13-year NFL career. Coach 
Will Muschamp, previously a 
defensive assistant for the Mi-ami Dolphins, remembers one practice in particular. Offensive coordinator Scott 
Linehan installed the counter play without telling Muschamp and head coach Nick Saban. The defense didn’t know either, 
but it didn’t have to. Thomas 
snuffed out a run 3 yards behind the line. 
Football is Charles Darwin’s 
dream sport. It’s the survival of the fittest. 
Those who 
thrive let their in-
stincts take over on Saturdays 
and Sundays. Gators linebacker 
Antonio Morrison does just that.
Morrison will make his sea-
son debut for No. 12 Florida (1-0) against Miami (1-0) at noon on 
Saturday in Sun Life Stadium.
“I think he’s got innate in-
stincts as far as reading, keying, 
diagnosing, which is key for 
linebackers to play off the ball,” 
Muschamp said.

For coach Becky Burleigh 
and the Gators, 2013 has been 
a year of many firsts.
Florida faced Oregon State 
on Aug. 25 for the first time since 2009.
When Savannah Jordan 
scored five goals in her first two 
games, she set the record for most goals scored by a player during a season-opening week-
end.
This weekend brings two 
more firsts as No. 10 Florida 
faces first-time opponents Oklahoma at James G. Pressly Stadium at 7 p.m. and Oklaho-
ma State at 1 p.m. on Sunday.
“It’s kind of nice this year to 
play a variety of teams,” Bur-leigh said. 
“I think it just gives fans 
some more exposure to dif-
ferent styles of soccer that are across the country in big-name conferences.”Burleigh said she welcomes 
the opportunity to face the Big 
12 teams for the first time in 
program history.
“For us, it’s about preparing 
so we know a little bit about 
them, but also probably more importantly us executing the 
things that we need to get bet-
ter at,” she said. 
“We still need to do a bet-
ter job of defending set pieces. We need to do a better job at executing in terms of our fin-
ishing. We’ve gotten plenty of 
chances, but we’ve got to stick 
those chances once we have 
them.”
Oklahoma may not pose a 
challenge to Florida other than 
the inexperience that comes 
from never facing a program.
Oklahoma finished the 2012 
season 7-9-4, going 3-3-2 in conference play.
The Sooners lost the first 
game of the Big 12 Champion-
ship and have not made the 
NCAA Tournament since 2010.Sunday’s opponent, Oklaho-
ma State, fared better in 2012. 
The Cowgirls finished with 
an 11-6-3 overall record. 
Oklahoma State has made 
consecutive appearances in the Elite Eight in 2010 and 2011. Florida has not made the Elite 
Eight since 2003.
“It’s going to be a hard-
fought battle,” senior midfield-
er Caroline Triglia said.
Florida enters the weekend 
3-1; Oklahoma comes in 2-2, 
while Oklahoma State has a re-
cord of 3-0-1 before its matchup 
with Florida State tonight. 
Freshman Meggie Dough-
erty Howard, who scored her 
first collegiate goal on Sunday, 
said the team has come togeth-
er well this season.
“I think we really showed 
a lot of heart and physical-ity [last weekend],” Dougherty 
Howard said. 
“Hopefully we can carry that 
over to our upcoming games 
and stay tough this season.” Florida preparing for weekend matchups with Big 12 foesperformed well offensively against Clem-
son, the Tigers have nobody on their de-fense that even comes close to the talent 
the Gamecocks can boast. Because of that, 
Aaron Murray will have a homecoming hangover as the Bulldogs start the season 0-2.
- Phil Heilman
Now onto the picks!
Leading the pack after a perfect 8-0 
record in Week 1 is alligatorSports Staff 
Writer Adam “Oedipus Complex” Pincus, who informed us this week that his moth-
er’s stage name is apparently “Sapphire.” 
We have no idea what to do with this in-formation.
One game behind Pincus in second 
place at 7-1 is alligatorSports editor Phil “We have a kitchen?” Heilman, who learned this week how to operate an oven. In this case, “learned” is loosely defined as 
“watching someone else preheat the oven 
and set the timer.” Be an adult, man.
In third with a 6-2 record is FightinGa-tors.com’s Cody “Andrelton Simmons Su-perfan” Jones, who finally decided to keep his man love for the Braves shortstop to 
himself this week instead of plastering his 
feelings all over Twitter. Oh, who are we kidding. Simba is awesome. Keep tweet-ing, Cody!
Tied with Cody at 6-2 is alligatorSports 
Staff Writer Joe “Final answer” Morgan, who took to Twitter to voice his displea-sure in the answer given by a contestant on  
“Who Wants to be a Millionaire.” Damn, Joe, put on your big-boy pants and leave the house during the day.
Heading the bottom half of the stand-
ings with a 5-3 record is 247Sports.com’s Thomas “I want every finna’” Goldkamp, who demanded his fellow beat writers transcribe player and coach quotes verba-
tim down to every “uh,” “um” and stutter. 
Relax, buddy. Not everybody keeps a chart of Brent Pease’s syllables per sentence.
Coming in even at .500 with a 4-4 clip 
is alligatorSports assistant editor Adam “Nothing to shake a sock at” Lichtenstein, who proved that there is such a thing as too many words out of one person’s mouth. If 
you’re going to use a bland cliché, at least say it right, damn it!
Tied with Lichtenstein at  4-4 is the Or-
lando Sentinel’s ragdE nospmohT, who 
walked into Tuesday’s Brent Pease press conference wearing his sweater backward. Hey Edgar, the tag isn’t a protective shield 
for your Adam’s apple. Look in a mirror 
before leaving the house next week.And in dead-ass last with a piss-poor 
record of 3-5 is InsideTheGators.com’s 
Bryan “Lawrence” Holt, who gets a pass 
from insult this week because last week’s Picks Column nearly brought him to tears. Hey Holt, take what’s left of that thing you 
call a backbone and use it to steady your 
upper lip.
ther have it or you don’t have it, and he has a very high level of that. He’s a physical, tough player. Football is very important to him.”
Unfortunately for the sophomore, his 
football future remained in doubt after two offseason arrests in five weeks. Muschamp suspended Morrison for two games about 
eight hours after the linebacker’s second 
transgression on July 21 only to minimize the suspension to one game 36 days later.
The details of what transpired and the 
merits of the consequences that followed take a back seat to the first Florida-Miami game in five years and possibly the last regular-season matchup between the two 
teams. 
Morrison, listed as a backup to Michael 
Taylor on an updated depth chart released 
Monday, gives the Gators more pop in  a 
linebacker corps that already packs a 
punch.Florida State remembers Morrison well 
— although former quarterback E.J. Manu-
el may not remember the linebacker at all. 
Manuel suffered a concussion on a hit by Morrison in the fourth quarter of Florida’s 37-26 victory in front of a stunned Doak 
Campbell Stadium crowd. Morrison forced 
a fumble and knocked the senior quarter-back out of the game. Joining him on de-fense for his 2013 debut will be cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy. The two forced a com-
bined four fumbles last season.
Defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said 
Morrison will “play quite a bit” on Satur-
day. He has practiced in full pads, so con-
ditioning should not be a problem with the 
noon kickoff. Florida could use some play-making ability after generating just one takeaway against Toledo and missing out on other turnover opportunities.
“We got the one, yeah, but absolutely, as 
physical as Antonio plays, he’s apt to knock the ball loose and Loucheiz is a long, rangy corner that can also get the ball out,” Dur-
kin said. 
“So, you know those guys fit into what 
we do well.”
Morrison begins his sophomore season 
at a new position after moving inside to the 
Mike linebacker spot. He will call the plays just like Thomas did with the Dolphins.
His return comes on the heels of a solid 
performance from the linebackers in Week 1 — Neiron Ball, Taylor and Ronald Pow-ell — who combined for nine tackles, two tackles for a loss and a sack.
Adding a linebacker who has “it” is a 
plus for an already athletic and versatile unit.
“We have a lot of depth on defense. As 
they showed on Saturday, they can play 
with the two deep. We have a lot of trust 
with our two deep on defense,” quarter-back Jeff Driskel said. 
“We went against them all of camp, 
so we know what they’re capable of and there’s good players across the board on our defense. Having him back will be a bo -
nus.” FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 15

The Gators continued their 
solid start to the 2013 season  
Thursday.
No. 8 Florida defeated 
Texas-San Antonio in three straight sets, 25–18, 25–17, 25–20, for its fourth straight win to open 2013.  
UF got off to a slow start 
in each set but got going in the latter half of each to close out the Roadrunners for the sweep.  
“Well, I think this win will 
become more signiﬁ  cant as the season goes on,” coach Mary Wise said.  
“I really think this UT-SA 
team is — as well-coached as they are and talented as they are — I think they’ve got a chance to really have a great year.” 
It could have been easy for 
the Gators to overlook an un-
heralded UT-SA with matches 
against the top two teams in the nation, Penn State and Stanford, looming this week-
end. 
But Florida was not caught 
napping. 
Senior setter Taylor Braun-
eis led the way with 36 assists, 11 digs and a hitting percent-
age of .667. 
Taylor Unroe was instru-
mental in keeping alive the 
long points that Florida won.  The junior libero had a team high 17 digs in the match.  
“Seventeen digs in three 
sets is getting it done,” Wise 
said.  
“[Unroe] did serve well.  
She had two service errors, but 
it’s a high-risk high-reward.  We can live with them.” 
Another standout for the 
Gators was sophomore out-side hitter Gabby Mallette, who tied for second on the team with nine kills. 
“Really happy with the 
play of Gabby Mallette,” Wise said. +“She struggled last weekend offensively and has put a lot of work into practic-es, in terms of using her high-
contact point and swinging 
and making contact up there.  
She’s really high; she was hit-
ting over people today.” 
Freshman right-side hitter 
Alex Holston continues the hot start to her college career 
after setting a new career high 
with nine kills.  Holston set the record for highest hitting 
percentage for a freshman in 
an opening weekend for Flor-
ida on Aug. 30 and 31.
After the game, Wise 
stressed the need for the set-
ters to begin relying on Hol-
ston and take some of the 
burden off of senior middle 
blocker Chloe Mann, who at-
tempted 22 attacks Thursday. 
The match against UT-SA 
is the Gators’ last before en-
tering the Nike Big Four Clas-
sic, which starts with a match 
against No. 2 Stanford Satur-
day at 4 p.m. 
In what was the Gators’ 
last chance to prepare for 
two of the nation’s toughest 
teams, Wise believes UF took 
full advantage.
“We learned more about 
ourselves today then playing 
at home last weekend,” Wise 
said.  “So, the Gators got bet-
ter today.”Gators drop anvil on Roadrunners
