The Alachua County Health Department issued a mos-
quito advisory earlier this week, announcing that mos-
quitoes capable of transmitting diseases such as the West Nile virus are swarming the county.  
 Paul Myers, health department administrator, said 
they’re the most potentially disease-carrying mosquitoes the county has seen in years.
Myers said the increase in population may be due to 
consistent rainfall and warm temperatures among other conditions.
Phillip E. Kaufman, a UF associate 
professor of veterinary entomology, said 
most Florida counties have mosquito surveillance systems in place to track populations year-round.  
Kaufman said the City of Gainesville 
usually does a good job of controlling mosquito populations, including treat-ing still water at development sites with 
products only toxic to larvae. The city will also begin fog-ging if there are especially high numbers.He said Alachua County does not have a mosquito 
control department due to cost and a low population of people in many areas of the county.
“It is more important to take the proper steps than to 
try home remedies,” he said.
Myers said mosquito populations will decline as the 
weather begins to cool but will not completely go away until the ﬁ  rst hard freeze.
For now, he suggests taking precautionary measures, 
including avoiding the outdoors during the times of dusk and dawn, wearing clothing that covers the skin and us-ing good-quality repellant.
He also advised residents to drain standing water fre-
quently, paying attention to bird feeders, house gutters and pool covers.County mosquitoes could be carrying diseases

The Florida Department of Transporta-
tion presented the proposed route and de-
sign of a new walking and biking trail to be built on the UF campus in 2015 at an open house Thursday night.
The UF Campus Greenway trail will 
begin on the south side of Hull Road, west of Southwest 34th Street and will connect many of the already existing campus trails until it reaches South Newell Drive and ends at Archer Road.
“It’s a safer and efﬁ  cient way to get 
through university property,” said Mike Osipov, vice president of Volkert Inc., the engineering ﬁ  rm in charge of designing the project.With construction costs estimated be-
tween $2.5 million and $2.8 million, the trail funded federally.
The designers of the project chose to use 
different materials throughout the trail to ﬁ  t the surrounding areas. They will better handle stormwater runoff and minimize ef-fects on the natural environment, said Gene Quinn, principal in charge of the project.
Chandler Otis, 59, a bicycle salesman 
and mechanic, said he has been anticipating this trail for about 15 years.
The trail will ultimately connect Haw-
thorne to Archer so people will be able to ride their bicycles continuously through those areas, Otis said.
“This is going to be a wonderful thing,” 
he said.Public sees plans for 2015

� ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF STUDENTS 
DROP OUT. 
ALEX HARRIS
Alligator Staff Writer aharris@alligator.org
Online classes may be changing education, 
but students’ study habits are not.
About 90 percent of students drop out of 
these massive open online courses, according to 
major course providers.
“MOOCs are courses that are, in general and 
certainly for UF students, are not taken for cred-it,” said Andrew McCollough, assistant provost for teaching and technology. ”As a consequence, it is not surprising that in terms of enrollees ﬁ  n-ishing the course, the number is relatively low.”However, this doesn’t mean the mission of 
the courses has failed, he said. The main idea of this type of education was to provide higher education at low or no cost to everyone, which doesn’t involve providing grades and creden-tials.

in robotics just because it sounds strange and Open online courses rarely ﬁ  nished

exotic, and you enrolled, that if after the 
ﬁ  rst few lectures, it became too technically involved for what you were interested in, you’d drop out,” said McCollough.
UF’s page on Coursera shows six mas-
sive open online courses.
McCollough calls these courses “alto-
gether different” from online education, which UF has recently dived into with the creation of UF Online, the country’s ﬁ  rst entirely online university.
“The expectations will be similar in rig-
or to that of a regular student,” he said.
This must be true, he said, because 
graduates of this program will receive the exact diploma as on-campus UF students.“The student who enrolls in UF online 
will be motivated by the possibility of ac-quiring not only the knowledge but also a certiﬁ  cation that they have acquired that knowledge,” he said. “It’s a much more traditional approach to education.”
UF students like Kristopher Davis, a 
21-year-old history junior, call the idea of these courses interesting.
“It sounds like something like the 
Gutenberg Project,” he said. “Where you get a whole lot of free resources that will help you better yourself that might not have anything to do with what you’re studying in an actual paid class.”
Davis said he thinks that more research 
is probably necessary to reﬁ  ne the business model and to discover ways to motivate students to complete the classes.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2013

Tom Donilon, former national secu-
rity adviser to President Barack Obama, 
spoke Thursday night at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
Donilon, whose speech was spon-
sored by UF’s ACCENT Speakers Bu-reau, spoke to about 80 people about U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Syria, global women’s rights and the raid on Osama bin Laden.
He said he spent three to four hours 
each morning preparing briefs with the intelligence community and other White House staff, and making them into digestible products for the presi-dent. 
He presented more than 700 brief-
ings for Obama.“One of the real challenges of the job 
was not letting the inbox dominate you each day,” he said. “It was a four-and-a-half-year conversation, each brief built up on the last.”
Donilon worked as national security 
adviser for about three years.
He said he remembers speaking to 
the president about deciding on wheth-er to initiate the raid on bin Laden.
“At the end of the day, we ask our 
president to make these decisions,” he said.
Jordan Grass, an 18-year-old UF 
sports management freshman, said she wished she could have heard more about how Donilon acquired his posi-tion.
“He’s deﬁ  nitely a smart guy,” Grass 
said. “He knows his stuff when it comes to politics.”Former NSA adviser speaks

He’s practicing.
Lopez, a 21-year-old UF ﬁ  rst-year grad-
uate student majoring in occupational ther-apy, is participating in GatorLAN Saturday at noon in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom. The event, hosted by Gator Gaming and sponsored by Student Government, is a gaming tournament for local Gainesville residents and students.
GatorLAN will bring Lopez and his 
team together to play in the same room for the ﬁ  rst time.
“It’s going to be a lot more interesting,” 
Lopez said. “You feel closer with your team. When someone makes a good play it makes it that much better, or if someone messes up, that much worse.”
There are ﬁ  ve members on the team, 
called Worst Team UF.
The tournament will also bring players 
of other games together. “League of Leg-ends,” “Dota 2,” “Halo 4,” “Pokemon,” “Super Smash Bros.” and “Street Fighter IV” are some of the games participants can register to compete in, said Ed Fonseca, a 21-year-old UF digital arts and sciences se-nior and president of Gator Gaming.
“It’s a fun tournament,” Fonseca 
said. “It’s competitive, but we like to bring the gaming community together in Gainesville.”
Pre-registration for the event is required 
for computer games and can be done through the Gator Gaming website. Regis-tration for console games will be available on the day of the event. Competitors are asked to bring their own computers, con-trollers and consoles.
Fonseca said the event is open to partici-
pants of any skill level.
“It’s really nice just having gamers come 
together and play and compete against each other in a friendly way,” he said. “We real-ize that not everyone is there to win No. 1. They’re just trying to have fun.”GatorLAN gaming event this

In 2011, UF alumnus Edward 
Lavagnino walked into a Sports 
Authority for a pair of socks and walked out with an idea.
Lavagnino, a graduate of the 
College of Engineering, started Gift Certiﬁ  cates and More, a website and smartphone app that allows users to get free gift certiﬁ  cates to local busi-nesses.
Lavignano said he got the idea 
for the website when he received a free Sports Authority gift certiﬁ  cate in the mail and wanted to “sell that feeling.”
“I started this business because 
I was unemployed at the time, in transition between jobs, and I just ran into this idea,” he said. “I saw the need, and I wanted to ﬁ  ll the need.”
Gift Certiﬁ  cates and More offers 
gift cards for $2 to $5 at more than 220 businesses in 
Gainesville, Ala-chua and Jones-ville. Lavignano said gift certiﬁ  -cates are available for seven busi-nesses in Mid-town and seven in downtown, 
along with other Gainesville loca-tions. Some local businesses offering the certiﬁ  cate are Beef ‘O’ Brady’s, :08, Chili’s, Dunkin’ Donuts and 101 Downtown. The website is free for both con-
sumers and businesses. Lavignano said his proﬁ  t comes from advertis-ers on his website. The free app is available for download in the App Store and Google Play.
Lavignano partnered with UF’s 
annual Dance Marathon fundraiser this past Spring to create punch cards with offers for more than 10 local restaurants. He said Dance Marathon raised more than $4,000 selling the cards.
Derek Gufﬁ  n, an assistant direc-
tor for academic and career advising at the Warrington College of Busi-ness Administration, said he has been a member of the website since it started.
“It’s really quite an effective busi-
ness model,” Gufﬁ  n said. “The nice thing about this is that it supports lo-cal businesses.”
Gufﬁ  n said he uses the gift cards 
to help pay for dry cleaning and meals at the Flying Biscuit Cafe.
“A couple bucks here and there 
— those things add up,” Gufﬁ  n said. “It’s quite an easy way to save some money.”

Since the 13th Street Walmart relo-
cated in January, the plans for the emp-
ty building have been on skids. Now, the property owner has taken the ﬁ  rst step toward redeveloping the location.
At a Sept. 3 meeting, Gainesville’s 
permit and development assistance agency First Step Center and property owner Kite Realty discussed plans to turn the site into a modernized shop-ping center with more tenants, trees and landscaping.
Nancy Testa, a permit and develop-
ment coordinator for the First Step Cen-ter, also said no plans were certain for the area, but Kite Realty said it wants to remodel the former Walmart building and partition the interior into different parcels.
Testa said possible tenants have not 
been speciﬁ  ed.
Erik Bredfeldt, the city’s planning 
and development director, said the meeting was a ﬁ  rst glance at future plans for the site.
“They were reviewing options for 
redevelopment of the property,“ he said. “Though it didn’t appear they had any solid plans for it yet.”Testa said First Step Center is used 
by companies for new developments or remodeling projects to guide them through the permitting stages and to send up red ﬂ  ags early in the develop-ment process.
“Kite Realty had no red ﬂ  ags be-
cause they’re basically just proposing a remodeling of the existing building,” she said. “There’s nothing now that could stop the project if they intend to go through with it.”
While the city’s planning depart-
ment intends to aid Kite Realty in the re-development process, some Gainesville residents also plan on getting involved.
John Hudson, president of Hudson 
& Company Inc., a local building in-spection company, said he is working with the City of Gainesville to start a committee of residents who will focus on coordinating public and private ef-forts for the redevelopment.
Hudson said a committee will 
ensure that cooperation among city government, the general public and developers enables the project to run smoothly.
“We have to work together to come 
up with answers that work for that property,” he said.Former Walmart location

First, a LAUREL to Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity, which 
has become the ﬁ  rst fraternity to promote mental health and suicide prevention at universities across the country through a partnership with The Jed Foundation.
It’s no secret fraternities tend to get a bad rep as groups of 
snapback-wearing, Natty-Light chugging d-bags, and frater-nities like FGCU’s Pike chapter only reinforce that stereotype. It’s heartwarming, then, to see some use their organization to spread goodness.
Sports Illustrated’s ongoing investigation into the dark 
underbelly of Oklahoma State University’s football scene becomes more disheartening by the minute. The Atlantic published an analysis of the university’s practice of using at-tractive hostesses to “recruit” high school football players — sometimes sleeping with the boys in order to convince them to choose the university.
“The Sports Illustrated report and the publication of ‘The 
System’ come at a moment when the use of women by col-lege football programs and the sexual abuse of women at the hands of college football players deserve as much attention as ever,” The Atlantic’s Jessica Luther wrote.
A DART, then, to OSU and other schools — both high 
schools and sprawling public universities with hefty athletics budgets — that prioritize football over the well-being of its female students.
Even though Americans eat a disgusting amount of cheese, 
as we mentioned on Wednesday, things are looking up in the high-calorie fast-food market. The New York Times reported yesterday that McDonald’s plans to roll out more healthy op-tions to its menu and stop marketing unhealthy items toward children. Side salads will be available for McCombo meals, fresh fruit and raw vegetables will be offered in the adult menu and McDonald’s plans to make over its Happy Meals packaging by featuring healthy foods in a “fun” way.
McDonald’s, you get a LAUREL! We wish you the best 
of luck in pushing your sad salads over those golden French fries that glisten with grease.
Finally, a DART to Badger, a brand of sunscreen for chil-
dren, that recalled 30,000 tubes of its lotions after discover-ing they were contaminated with bacteria and fungus. Gross! People were slathering that stuff on babies! Between Naked juice and Chobani yogurt, these food and sun-protection gi-ants need to pull their acts together.

Starbucks has every right to ban guns
Have you ever given a child a piece of candy and 
told them not to show it to their siblings?
Admitting that you have may entitle you 
to an administrative position at Starbucks, as you’ve demonstrated an understanding of its previous gun policy.
Starbucks used to assume an apathetic stance toward 
guns — a kind of “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy in which armed customers could purchase all the coffee they wanted as long as they didn’t ﬂ  aunt their ﬁ  rearms in front of other customers.
However, just like children, gun-toting coffee 
enthusiasts — or coffee-toting gun enthusiasts — couldn’t resist the temptation and took indifference as endorsement and decided to stage a Starbucks Appreciation Day.
According to USA Today, two weeks ago, gun owners 
showed their appreciation for what they thought was endorsement by parading around Starbucks with their weapons, including in the Newtown Starbucks. 
The calamity prompted a plea from Starbucks CEO 
Howard Schultz for all Starbucks patrons to leave their semi-automatic self-defense mechanisms at home.
In a guest column, fellow UF student Margaret Beck 
wrote that the request asks too much of citizens, who must “leave their rights at the door.” 
Beck also compared the Second Amendment right 
to other rights, arguing that a customer with a gun is equally entitled to enter Starbucks as the person with a rainbow-colored shirt.
Beck’s article posed some moral questions such 
as whether you would want to be standing next to a registered gun owner or an unregistered “bad guy” in line. 
This is a very common argument, as it expresses 
concern over the safety of gun-free zones.
According to USA Today, a woman carrying a gun in St. Petersburg accidentally shot another woman when she dropped her purse, which caused the gun to discharge. 
Luckily, Starbucks hasn’t 
ofﬁ  cially changed its policy, so the “good guy” with the gun was still able to get her iced latte.
The logic behind the outrage being projected at 
Starbucks is just bizarre. 
According to The Hufﬁ  ngton Post, Whole Foods 
and Disney World are among many other companies to ban weapons on their properties, so why are people so outraged at Starbucks? 
There is an obsessive tendency among gun owners to 
act out whenever someone tells them not to bring their guns to the party.
Look, no one is telling you to give up your guns to 
the government. 
They’re just nicely asking that you don’t bring your 
handgun with you to buy a cup of coffee.
Yet somehow there’s always someone who feels 
insecure about the unfriendly and crime-conducive environments that Starbucks have to offer, and they feel people with guns should be present in these places for everyone to be safe.
Well, the answer is no: There isn’t an urgent need for 
armed vigilantes at Starbucks, so maybe you should try Dunkin’ Donuts instead. 
The only people gun owners have to blame in this 
situation are themselves, as they would never have faced such a request from Starbucks if they hadn’t adopted the coffee shop as an ally in their battle to keep guns on the streets.

Although shows like “Grey’s Anato-
my” took a gigantic, melodramatic step back in the world of music align-
ing with a scene, the art is still alive, most notably in “Breaking Bad.” As we head into the ﬁ  nal episode, here’s a look back to those moments you actually used the app Shazam. SPOILER WARNING.
No. 5: TV on the Radio: “DLZ”In a scene that starts out like an American 
wet dream, Walt heads to the Home Depot for some KILZ coating. This DIY white-pick-et-fence fantasy was inspired by his recent remission news, and in the beginning of the episode, he informs Jesse of his decision to quit the business.
But as we all know, Walt’s ego is the size 
of Gale’s “Star Trek” collection. While head-ing to the checkout line, Walt notices a Jesse look-alike small-time methamphetamine cook who’s buying acetone, lye and other household products used to cook.
After Walt lends a friendly neighbor tip 
— “different items, different stores” — the meth newb is spooked and runs away. While in line, shoulder-to-shoulder with his common-man peers, Heisen-berg begins to emit through Walt’s pores and “DLZ” starts to play. He ditches the coating and heads out to the parking lot, where he tells the two amateur-hour meth cooks: “Stay out of my territory.”
No. 4: Los Cuates de Sinaloa: “Negro y 
Azul”
Your high school Spanish class should 
get you as far as the meaning of this song, but it’s your freshman year of college Eng-lish class that will get you to understand the song and Walt’s black and blue imagery — black for Heisenberg, blue for the meth. This is the episode after that junkie got his head smashed by an ATM, and it’s only ﬁ  tting the cold opening is a music video of a narcocor-rido band performing an original song about a gringo meth cook whose product is attract-ing the attention of the cartel.
No. 3: Nat “King” Cole and George Shear-
ing: “Pick Yourself Up”
Show creator Vince Gilligan said, “As they always teach in writing class, steal from the best.” The mass-killings-done-in-three-prisons-within-two-minutes montage felt like something out of “The Godfather.” When I ﬁ  rst saw this 
scene, I was streaming it while living in Ar-gentina, and trying to describe how amazing the episode was with my basic Spanish to my host mom was futile — though meth in Span-ish is metanfetamina!
No. 2: Quartetto Cetra: “Crapa Pelada”ASAC Schrader described Gale Boetticher 
as “a bona ﬁ  de chemistry genius. I mean, he’s got degrees up the wazoo, right? And, uh, as you might expect, he’s a nerd’s nerd, right — vegan, sandals-and-socks kind of guy. As it turns out, he’s also A-number-one meth cook.”
Beyond the “Major Tom” music video 
and his love for poetry, Gale was also a music savant who uncovered this Italian gem about a man with a bald head. He sings along to the song in a perfect recital just as Gus shows up to his apartment to discuss their bald-headed friend.
No. 1: Darondo: “Didn’t I”When this lost ’70s soul jam was played 
on the show, Walt had hair. When Darondo’s only inkling of a hit song came on, Walt was living another “American Dream” of putting a jerk in his or her place by blowing up his or her car at a gas station.
As the former pimp-turned-singer’s song 
began to enter through your speakers, Wal-ter White began to transform into Heisen-berg. His use of the squeegee as an explosive device by sticking it into the gas tank of that BMW-driving wiener was one of the ﬁ  rst and most catching moments of Walt’s transfor-mation from Mr. Chips into Scarface. 
After that, he’d poison kids, leave addicts 
unturned and inﬂ  uence a plane crash, but it was at this moment that he broke bad with a sweet song.
I’m going to slide this prediction in there 
for no reason: Marie kills Walt in the end.

Student senator running for re-election
Hello, fellow Gators!
I am humbled to announce that after a successful year 
of serving as a student senator for District C represent-ing students in the 32607 zip code, I am running for re-election!
I’ve chosen to run with Swamp Party because I’ve seen 
ﬁ  rsthand how Swamp Party makes positive change in our district. Just recently Swamp Party and our senators led an initiative to decrease wait times on off-campus bus routes such as the 1, 9, 12, 20 and 35.
However, it’s not Swamp Party’s past achievements 
that encouraged me to reslate with Swamp Party, but its platform for the future of our district. Decreasing the parking restrictions at Southwest Recreation Center, ﬁ  ght-ing towing increases and expanding bus routes are just a few of Swamp Party’s platform points that will beneﬁ  t our district.
I invite you to learn more about Swamp Party online 
at www.swamppartyuf.com or contact me at davisbean@gmail.com.
Go Gators!

OCALA — The Ocala Drive-in 
Theatre received a digital projec-
tor after winning an online com-petition Monday.
The drive-in earned the projec-
tor as a prize for garnering a high number of votes in Honda’s Proj-ect Drive-in, which featured nine drive-in theaters across the coun-try and invited people to vote for which ones should receive the up-grades. The voting period ended Saturday.
The program was originally 
only giving away ﬁ  ve projectors but decided to give four more away to save additional theaters, said Charles Watzke, one of the Ocala Drive-in’s owners.In April, 21st Century Fox an-
nounced that by summer it would discontinue 35 mm ﬁ  lm reels — the type the theater plays every week. Many American drive-ins have closed already due to the cost of switching from ﬁ  lm to digi-tal projection, which costs about $80,000.
Watzke reopened the Ocala 
theater in 2011, after it had been closed down for eight years.
Representatives from Proj-ect Drive-In originally contacted Watzke, asking him to participate in the contest, he said.
The project was created by 
Honda to help prevent American drive-ins from going out of busi-ness. When voting, participants were given the option to donate money toward the projectors.
Now that the contest has 
wrapped up, the program, which features a U.S. map with pinpoints indicating the locations of drive-ins across the nation, will keep working toward saving as many drive-ins as possible, Watzke said.
Sara Ulrich, a 20-year-old UF 
advertising junior, used to go to the drive-in when she lived in Ocala.
“The drive-in theater was al-
ways so much fun to go to when I was younger,” Ulrich said. “Now that they have the new projector, I want to go back and experience the drive-in again.”

At the beginning of the second 
day of voting for the People’s Choice 
award at National Red Bull Flugtag Miami, the Gator Aviators were in last place. Max Famiglietti, Jon Kiste-maker, Chris Roda, Aaron Alangui-lan and Rocky Flood started rallying for support.
Flugtag, a Red Bull competition in 
which people ﬂ  y homemade, human-powered machines, took place last weekend. The Gator Aviators took home the People’s Choice award.
Famiglietti, a 22-year-old UF me-
chanical engineering senior, sent about 2,000 text messages asking for votes. Roda and Flood sent emails over UF listservs and posted on their fraternity’s Facebook groups.
“We even resorted to doing back-
ﬂ  ips for votes,” said Roda, a 22- year-old UF mechanical and aerospace engineering senior.
The night before the Sept. 21 event, 
the team didn’t have much hope, said Flood, a 22-year-old UF chemical en-gineering senior.
At the end of the competition Sat-
urday, the team earned 6,356 votes, which put them in ﬁ  rst place for Peo-ple’s Choice.
They won a VIP trip to New York 
to watch a New York Red Bulls soc-cer game from a luxury suite at the Red Bull Arena.
“We put a lot of work into this, 
so it felt really good when it actually paid off,” Famiglietti said.Gator Flugtag team wins

Dante Fowler Jr. had two 
weeks to wait for, visualize 
and put into action his plan to wreak havoc on the Tennessee offense. 
After turning in a subpar 
performance during a 21-16 loss to Miami on Sept. 7, Fowler stewed during Florida’s bye week — waiting impatiently for another opportunity to make a difference.
His redemption came against 
the Volunteers. 
Now, the Gators’ coaching 
staff hopes this Fowler — the freak athlete capable of disrupt-ing opposing offenses with jar-ring hits — is here to stay.
“Dante really let it loose,” 
defensive coordinator D.J. Dur-kin said. 
“That was more indicative 
of what we feel like we can see from him every week.”
For everything Fowler failed 
to do against the Hurricanes — he totaled just three tackles, one for a loss — he accomplished in full force against the Volun-teers. 
It all started on Tennessee’s 
opening possession. Beginning its drive at the 
UF 15-yard line after punter Kyle Christy botched a snap on fourth down, UT looked to run off right tackle on second and 8 from the UF 13-yard line.
Fowler had other plans. The sophomore Buck line-backer barreled into the back-field and pummeled Tennessee running back Rajion Neal, forc-ing a fumble. 
Fowler pounced on the ball 
in the Volunteers’ backfield, setting the tone for Florida’s defense, which forced six turn-overs in a 31-17 victory. 
“I actually spiked the ball 
down,” Fowler said. “Then I thought about it like, ‘Oh snap, I’m going to get a personal foul.’”
He ended the game with two

OK, take it easy. You’re reading 
this, aren’t you? Hey, at least we don’t cause a train wreck whenever we open our mouths like the one and only Kanye West. Is that guy just high all the time? What is his deal?
We don’t know much outside 
of football — hell, we don’t know much about football at all — but we’re sure of one thing: Either Kanye is a genius far, far ahead of his time — we’re talking like 3,000 years — or the guy is just absolutely off his rocker. 
The whole thing is just sort of 
bonkers. 
And who hates Jimmy Kimmel? 
When it comes to late-night talk show hosts, we thought everybody hated Jay Leno. 
Well, no disrespect to Ben Af-

I never was much of a fan of 
Georgia until I picked former Bull-dog quarterback Matthew Stafford for my fantasy football team this year. He’s been awesome. Turns out his prodigy, Aaron Murray, isn’t so bad himself. Murray will be solid and Todd Gurley will run free like a young colt, helping the ‘Dawgs win this rodeo.

In Savannah Jordan, the Gators trust.
When it comes to putting a powerhouse 
forward against Mississippi (8-1-1, 1-0 Southeastern Conference), Jordan will give Florida (7-1-1, 1-0 SEC) more than offensive talent at the Ole Miss Soccer Stadium at 8 p.m. 
Jordan’s strength in making high-line 
tackles will be important in limiting Ole Miss senior forwards Rafaelle Souza and Mandy McCalla, who each scored 13 goals scored and accumulated 33 points to lead the SEC last season.
Coach Becky Burleigh said Ole Miss’ 
midfielders target Souza and McCalla on the field to produce mul-
tiple shot opportunities.
“They’re as good as 
people we’ll see the rest of the year,” Burleigh said. “We have to make sure we know what we’re doing against those two play-ers.”
Souza has been dynamic this season. Her 
total of 11 goals ties her with two others for the most in the nation in 2013. 
McCalla has seven goals and three assists 
this season.
Jordan, the SEC Freshman of the Week, 
is one goal shy of Souza after notching her ninth and 10th of the season during Florida’s 3-0 victory against Alabama on Sept. 20.The freshman forward said the Gators 
need to continue the style of play that has proven to be effective when Florida faces Ole Miss.
“We just need to stay focused,” Jordan 
said. “Especially on away trips, it’s hard to play at other teams’ facilities with all the fans against you and the teams against you.”
Ole Miss has momentum coming off a 
four-game win streak. The Rebels have won four consecutive home matches.
“We’re the type of team to thrive off a 
hostile environment,” freshman Liz Slattery said. “That just builds more energy for us to go forward and think we’re going to show

against Florida State on Sept. 17 in the O’Connell Center.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer @jczupryn
On Wednesday afternoon in 
the Lemerand Center gym, Dave 
Boos was invested in just one person: Nikki O’Rourke.
“Where’s your angle?” UF’s 
associate head coach asked be-fore serving another ball across the net.
“To the right,” the sophomore 
defensive specialist yelled back, moving her intertwined hands and locked arms a few inches up, ready to practice her serve receive.
In preparation for No. 3 Flor-
ida’s (11-1) matchup with Mis-sissippi State (9-5) tonight at 8 and Sunday’s game against Ole Miss (10-3) at 2:30 p.m., Boos, the Gators’ defensive coach, has been working one-on-one with more players to solidify the me-chanics that make up an efficient defense.
“The defense that we run is a 
very advanced tactical system, but it can’t be done at a high level until the players have the techni-cal skills,” coach Mary Wise said. 
“And so the one-on-one that 
Dave does ... gives them that training to really advance their skill set.”
Wise added that her four de-
fensive specialists, who are re-sponsible for passing the ball to setter Taylor Brauneis and dig-ging any attacks that land their way, have improved their per-formances each time Boos picked apart their game in practice.
Taylor Unroe, who anchors 
the backcourt as a third-year libe-ro, said the attention to detail by Boos — especially in the passing game — is the difference between a team trying to just survive and a team driving to win.
“It’s not like algebra,” she 
joked. 
“You learn algebra once and 
then you never use it again. These skills are something that we actu-ally do every single day. A foot here or an arm here or an angle here is actually something that will determine if you get a good pass or a bad pass.”
The ability to deliver a consis-
tent pass from Unroe to Brauneis has been stressed after nearly ev-ery match by Wise, who said the Gators cannot make any progress on the court without an effective first contact by the back row.With Florida’s match against 
an MSU squad that returns just five players from last year, Brau-neis said communication, along with Boos’ hands-on coaching, will help the passing game adjust against the new-look Bulldogs.
“Me and Taylor talk after every 
point,” Brauneis said. “We talk about her pass and if it’s good, if it needs to be higher (or) if it needs to be lower. With (Unroe’s) pass, I’m more confident running balls to the middle, which is what we need to do.”
Unroe said MSU provides the 
perfect challenge for Florida’s passing strategy because the Bulldogs can keep a ball alive long enough to break the Gators out of their system.
“Sometimes, even if you’re 
passing well, if someone just keeps the ball in play over and over and over again, sometimes it gets a little bit more difficult to keep going on those passing runs,” she said.
But Boos said he has confi-
dence in his defensive specialists to limit MSU’s scoring attack and, in turn, provide Brauneis oppor-tunities to set up the offense for potential attacks.
“That whole defensive crew 
that we have, any of them back there can be the highlight of the night,” Boos said. 
“Any of them can have the big 
night.”

� GATORS LOOKING FOR TOP RUNNERS.
GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
With the Wisconsin adidas Invitational loom-
ing, Florida is looking to determine the top 
seven runners who will compete on Oct. 19 in Madison. 
The first group to show what they’ve got is 
the men, who are running at the Florida Runners Invitational being held in Titusville today. 
“We’re going to give our top guys a chance 
to rest and train through this weekend,” coach Paul Spangler said. “We have the big Wisconsin meet coming up. We’re going to take a small group of guys (to Titusville) and give them an opportunity to race a 5K, which is something we don’t normally get an opportunity to race.”
The meet will help Spangler determine who 
will round out his top seven. According to Span-gler, Florida’s top four is effectively set with Jim-my Clark, Mark Parrish, Eddie Garcia and J.L. Hines. Carlos Miranda was UF’s fifth runner at this year’s Mountain Dew Invitational.
“Your top five guys make up your team 
score” Spangler said.” [Miranda] ran great.”
With the top four set, three spots are left for 
10 runners. 
“All we need is one guy to really step it up,” 
Spangler said. “That person to be our fifth we want to be as close to our fourth as possible.”
The depth of the men’s team is a luxury Span-
gler appreciates. 
With many athletes competing at a high level, 
hoping to earn a spot at the heralded Wisconsin meet, motivation is not an issue. “It’s definitely a plus,” Spangler said of the 
surplus of athletes. “You don’t want to have to count on one guy. You’d love to have four or five (athletes) on any given day and have one step up.”
While the men have plenty 
of talent, the women’s team is suffering from a lack of eli-gible runners.
Injuries and sickness have 
ravaged the squad, with Shel-
by Hayes and Stephanie Strasser out since the season opener at Western Carolina. 
“Whereas the men are healthy, the women 
are a little banged up and sick, so (this break) will give the women a chance to recover and be ready to race in a couple of weeks,” Spangler said. 
The women’s auditions for Wisconsin will be 
held at the Disney Cross Country Classic in Or-lando, one week before Wisconsin. 
Spangler, along with the rest of the team, 
hopes to have both Strasser and Hayes back by then.
“Steph and Shelby: possibly,” Spangler said 
when asked if Strasser and Hayes will run at the Disney Classic. “We have a couple weeks to look at where they’re at physically. Both of them are sick and a little banged up.” 
Fortunately for the women, they have anoth-
er two weeks to recuperate.
For the time being, it’s the men’s turn. Today, 
Spangler hopes to solidify his fifth runner above all else. 
“If one of those guys can get within 20 sec-
onds of our fourth runner, we’ll be alright,” he said.Florida using meet as auditionWomen’S tenniS

The Gators are gearing up to 
make their longest trip of the sea-
son. 
The UF women’s tennis team 
will journey almost 2,500 miles to Pacific Palisades, Calif., for the eight-day ITA All-American 2013 Riviera Classic. 
“That’s when we really find out 
what we have, right?” coach Ro-land Thornqvist said. “Because the best players in the country will be there.” 
“And it’s at the Riviera Country 
Club, what more can you ask? So if you can’t perform there, you know you’re having issues.” 
The Riviera Classic pre-qualify-
ing rounds begin Saturday and end with finals matches on Oct. 6. 
Senior Sofie Oyen will get five 
days of rest. Because she has al-ready secured a spot in the main draw, she will not hit the court until Thursday. 
Belinda Woolcock, the only 
freshman competing for UF at Rivi-era, will begin play on Day 1 in the pre-qualifying rounds. 
Seniors Alexandra Cercone and 
Olivia Janowicz, along with sopho-more Brianna Morgan, will all start their tournaments in the qualifying rounds on Tuesday. 
In doubles, Oyen and Woolcock, 
who captured the Duke Fab Four double tournament championship during their first competition to-gether, will start off in the qualify-ing round, too. 
Associate head 
coach Dave Ba-logh, who has been at UF for 14 years, has led the team’s Rivera Tennis Club outing for the past 13 years. 
During that 
time, Balogh has coached seven All-American championship singles and doubles titles — the most re-cent being Lauren Embree’s singles championship title last year. 
“As long as you go into it know-
ing this is going to be tough you have a better chance of handling it the right way,” Balogh said.
He has stressed mental and 
physical toughness going into the 10-day outing. Balogh expects bat-tles on the court since the Gators will be up against the top players in the nation. 
“You kind of see where you’re 
at with the big kids,” Balogh said. “We play some smaller tourna-ments here and there to get ready, but this is it.”UF begins trip to California

UF Cross 
Countryjuleps after it beats Georgia because...
Zach Mettenberger has finally put it all 
together. With 10 touchdowns and only 
one pick, Mettenberger has led LSU to the No. 16 scoring offense in the country. The Tigers average more than 43 points per game. And did you watch the Bulldogs last week? They almost lost to North Tex-as. It might be a photo finish, but LSU will be celebrating like Kentucky Derby cham-pions.
-Adam Lichtenstein
Now onto the picks!
Leading the pack with a 21-10-1 record 
is alligatorSports Staff Writer Joe “Roaring 
‘20s” Morgan, who spouted out “The West Wing” quote, “Never trust a man who doesn’t shine his own shoes.” Great ad-vice, Joe. We’ll be sure to heed it when we walk to the local nickelodeon to get a look at the talkies. Sorry, Joe, you will never be as cool as Alan Alda.
Sitting in second at 20-11-1 is alliga-
torSports Editor Phillip “Super Size Me” Heilman, who hit a pathetic low earlier this week by consuming four McDonald’s McDoubles in a single day. Good Lord, Phil. At least swallow before taking an-other bite. Just because you ask for only ketchup and mustard doesn’t make it any less fattening.
Tied for second is FightinGators.com’s 
Cody “Can’t Touch This” Jones, who bragged about finishing his interview transcription before anyone else during a media availability session this week. Con-grats, buddy. You really know what’s im-portant in life. Hopefully you don’t finish that quickly in every aspect of your life.
In third with a record of 19-12-1 is alli-
gatorSports Assistant Editor Adam “HE’S AN ATHLETE, OK?“ Lichtenstein, who was really distraught when ESPN’s Jim Caple called Mariano Rivera the most overrated player of his generation. Chin up, buddy. Starting next week, you’ll have all offseason to send Caple angry tweets about it. Until then, enjoy Rivera playing in the outfield. He’ll fit right in with the Yankees’ “Is anybody still watching” out-field full of 40-year-old has-beens.
Also at 19-12-1 is 247sports.com’s 
Thomas “JENGA!” Goldkamp, who advo-cated that the Gators simply add layers to the O’Connell Center parking garage and build an indoor football practice facility on the site of the O’Dome parking lot. Hey, at least he wasn’t the guy on Twitter who suggested UF tear down Library West. LOL.
At 18-13-1 is alligatorSports Staff Writ-
er Adam “Fashionista” Pincus, who spent somewhere between five minutes and an hour deciding which tie to wear to the Tennessee-Florida game. Good thing we have a long car ride ahead of us, because Adam probably won’t have his tie selected until we hit Chattanooga. Don’t worry. We won’t make you drive. 
Next at 15-16-1 is the Orlando Sentinel’s 
Edgar “Paging Wayne Wanta“ Thompson, who expressed his desire to teach a college class one day. God help anyone who has to take a class with this guy. Most people can’t stand listening to him talk for more than five minutes, let alone a full period of 50. Yeah, man. We get it. You’re related to Washington Irving or something. Big deal.
And in dead-ass last with a piss-poor 
record of 14-17-1 is InsideTheGators.com’s Bryan “DO YOUR JOB!“ Holt, who was reprimanded by Gatorzone.com’s Chris Harry, when he poked fun at Harry by tweeting a video of Will Muschamp im-ploring his defense to play better by pum-meling a dry erase board with his fore-arm during his days with Texas. Harry snapped right back, leaving Holt helpless to do little more than pick up the pieces. Don’t mess with Chris Harry, kids. And learn some respect, young man.
forced fumbles, three tackles 
for a loss and one sack. Fowl-er’s effort earned him South-eastern Conference Defensive Player of the Week honors.
“He’s a guy that continues 
to improve and play well,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“He played much better 
than he did his previous time out, and he’s a guy that can be a very disruptive player for us.”
Fowler’s role will become 
even more important with se-nior defensive tackle Domin-ique Easley out for the season after suffering ACL and menis-cus tears in his right knee dur-ing Tuesday night’s practice. 
Despite being just 19 years 
old and not even midway into his second full season with the Gators, Fowler is now consid-ered one of the defense’s lead-ers.
Football is a grown man’s 
game. The SEC is a grown man’s league. He is prepared to continue making a differ-ence. 
“We take defense really 
seriously, especially after the year that we had last year,” Fowler said. 
“I know a lot of people had 
some doubt going into this year, so we wanted to play even harder and be better than last year.”
Through three games, 
Fowler and fellow Buck line-backer Ronald Powell lead the Gators with four tackles for a loss each. 
Fowler has added two 
forced fumbles, one sack and three quarterback hurries. 
He has an opportunity to 
improve on those numbers when No. 20 Florida (2-1) faces Kentucky (1-2) on Saturday at 7 p.m. 
Fowler and the Gators 
blanked the Wildcats 38-0 on Sept. 22, 2012, in Ben Hill Grif-fin Stadium. 
Searching for their next shut-
out and a playmaker to lead the charge, the Gators believe they have the correct player and a prime opportunity in front of them this weekend. 
“He’s just scratching the 
surface for what he can do, and he’s starting to realize it,” Dur-kin said. 
“We’re going to keep push-
ing him and coaching him like crazy.”Florida plays at Missouri on Sun day
them up on their turf.”
However, Ole Miss isn’t Flor-
ida’s only challenge this week-end.
Florida will make a quick turn-
around and spend all of Saturday traveling to Walton Stadium to face Missouri (5-4, 1-0 SEC) on Sunday. The last time the two teams 
met, the Gators blanked the Ti-gers with a 3-0 shutout to advance to the final round of the 2012 SEC Tournament.
Despite Missouri’s unimpres-
sive record, the Tigers have not lost a match on their home turf this season.
“Missouri is always going to 
play at a pretty frenetic pace and put up a lot of pressure,” Burleigh said. “If we keep the ball a lot and frustrate them in terms of our pos-session, that bodes well for us.”
This is the first time this season 
when the Gators play a pair of away matches in one weekend.
“We’ll be out of routine,” Bur-
leigh said. 
“It’ll be important to see how 
well we adapt to that.”

Florida will begin its swimming and div-
ing season today in the O’Connell Center at 
10 a.m. at the Pinch A Penny All Florida In-vitational. 
The meet will run through the weekend 
with prelims starting at 9 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday followed by ﬁ  nals at 4 p.m. 
Tonight’s ﬁ  nals will begin at 7. “This meet is unique because you have a 
lot of the Florida swimmers and divers to-gether,” coach Gregg Troy said. 
“There are a lot of athletes that were re-
cruited by all of the schools, so they all know one another.”
The men’s team returns 11 of the 13 All-
Americans from last season and the entire NCAA champion 800-yard freestyle relay team, which is composed of redshirt senior Sebastien Rousseau, sophomore Pawel Wer-ner, senior Marcin Cieslak and junior Dan Wallace.
Coming off her second NCAA title in 
March with a victory in the 400-yard indi-vidual medley, Elizabeth Beisel headlines the women’s team.
The invitational is unique because of the 
amount of teams competing.
“It’s a different format,” Troy said. “No 
matter how well we swim, only three people can swim in the ﬁ  nals at night.
“We may be in a situation where we have 
six or seven people that could have scored, but only the ﬁ  rst three can swim at night.”Gators begin 
season today at home at 10 a.m. Each week, two alligatorSports colum-
nists will debate the biggest looming matchup in college football. Today, 
Adam Pincus and Joe Morgan preview No. 6 LSU’s showdown against No. 9 Georgia in Athens, Ga., on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. on CBS.
Adam: This is a game between two 
of the Southeastern Conference’s best 
teams. LSU, a much healthier version of Florida, visits Georgia, which has the best offense in the SEC not led by Johnny Football.
It’ll be an upset of sorts for LSU 
with Georgia favored by three points. The over-under is 61.5 points. I expect 20 Les Miles grass-tastes, two Zach Mettenberger touchdowns and a domi-nating performance from LSU’s run-ning backs led by sophomore Jeremy Hill and his 117 yards per game. Plus, I’m a huge fan of Cajun food. What do they even eat in Georgia? I thought Georgians were always busy choking in big games. Peach State native Joe Morgan should be able to answer this.
Joe: Well, Pincus, Miami guys like 
you are never around to see those chokes. Or the rallies. Y’all can’t be bothered to stay until the end. Just ask Ray Allen. In this battle of Clemson’s SEC victims, Georgia will defeat LSU on Saturday “Between the Hedges.” Why? Because of what you said — the Bull-dogs have the best offense in the SEC not quarterbacked by Johnny Manziel. Look no further than Georgia’s own signal-caller Aaron Murray. He ranks fourth nationally with a 201.78 passer rating, ﬁ  fth with 346.7 passing yards per game and sixth with a 72 percent completion rate. Even an elite defense like LSU will struggle to slow down a quarterback this experienced and this precise, especially on his home turf. And if this one devolves into a shoot-out, I fully expect Murray to outgun Mettenberger.
Adam: This should be a heck of a 
ballgame. College GameDay will ema-nate from the site of an LSU game for the 11th straight sea-son. I wouldn’t mind making a pit stop in Ath-ens before head-ing to Lexington, Ky., for the barn burner that will be No. 20 Florida against Kentucky.
Stat of the week for these two teams: 
LSU is 50-0 under Les Miles in his eight years at the school when holding oppo-nents to fewer than 100 rushing yards while LSU eclipses the century mark on the ground. Mettenberger will con-tinue his efﬁ  cient season in which he ranks second in the SEC in passing efﬁ  -ciency. Georgia happens to be ﬁ  rst, but LSU doesn’t have to beat the ‘Dawgs through the air. Mettenberger just has to be in the same ballpark as Murray when it’s over. The key will be running the football.
In accordance with the corny college 
football tradition of wearing the same color shirts, Mark Richt called for a “redout” at Sanford Stadium on Satur-day. C’mon Richt. How stupid can you guys be? Red just draws more attention to yourself. The LSU defensive line, led by Anthony Johnson, doesn’t need any extra help.
Joe: Pincus, only someone as bull-
headed as you would be distracted by a bunch of red. I know. What a toro-bull joke, right? If you want to talk about the running game, I’d like to introduce you to a man named Todd Gurley. Gurley is a workhorse who thrives between the tackles and also boasts good speed. He leads the SEC with 125.7 rushing yards on 21 carries per game. When Murray isn’t throwing the ball, LSU defenders will be throwing themselves at Gur-ley’s heels as he races down the ﬁ  eld. And if Gurley isn’t enough to ﬂ  oat your boat, UGA also has speedsters Keith Marshall and J.J. Green to carry the ball out of the backﬁ  eld. With Murray throwing and the Bulldogs’ solid stable of running backs, a Tigers defense that lost seven starters from last year’s unit will face its ﬁ  rst 
true test in one of the most hostile road environments in college football. Miles will be snacking on his ﬁ  ngernails long before moving on to the grass at San-ford Stadium.
Adam: This will test the young Ti-
gers with their 14 true freshmen getting playing time. That’s third in the SEC. LSU will be up to the task. After a week in which college football took a Satur-day off, this top-10 matchup will be a must watch. Both squads boast a com-plete team and could be meeting come December in Atlanta. My colleague Joe Morgan thinks Gurley and Co. will run the Tigers back to the Bayou. I’m going with LSU in this baptism by ﬁ  re for the sixth-ranked team in the country. Need I also mention Aaron Murray’s 5-11 re-cord against top-25 teams? It may be unfair to the former Plant quarterback, but there’s a reason these Bulldogs can’t win the big game.
Joe: Granted, Murray and Richt 
have struggled in big games against ranked opponents. That was a huge hurdle for them coming into 2013 and losing at Clemson opening weekend did not help. But Saturday marks one hell of an opportunity. Georgia’s explo-sive offense faces a talented but young defense trying to get its feet wet in front of a crowd starved for another SEC championship. Meanwhile, a young Bulldogs defense in search of consistent playmakers has the chance to do some growing up by winning a statement game against a talented but stoppable Tigers offense. LSU will put up a great ﬁ  ght beginning at 3:30 p.m. on CBS, but at the end of the day, the Bulldogs will have the Tigers crying, “Uncle Verne!”
