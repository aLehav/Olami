“Family Guy” made jokes at the 
Gators’ expense, and not everyone 
is laughing.
In Sunday’s episode, “Space Ca-
det,” UF is mistaken for a “Down syndrome camp.”
In its 11th season, the notori-
ously raunchy television show “Family Guy” has been criticized for pushing boundaries.
Robert Porter, a 20-year-old po-
litical science junior, said he wasn’t 
a fan of the show.
“I’m not one to make fun of the 
mentally handicapped, but I guess 
some people get a kick out of it,” he said.
Although the nine-second clip has started to go viral, Porter said he wasn’t upset.
“Everyone knows this is the 
best school in the state,” he said. “I 
think maybe they got us confused 
with Florida State.”
TV and American Society pro-
fessor Jessica Mahone saw the clip posted on Facebook.
She has seen almost every epi-sode, and although profanity and offensiveness are gimmicks of the show, Mahone said, “Family Guy” 
has become more aggressive with 
how they perceive different types of people.
This is not the ﬁ  rst time Down syndrome has been used as a punchline.
“That’s a group of people who 
already experience in their day-to-
day lives more difﬁ  culty,” she said.
As the older sister of a sibling 
who is intellectually disabled, Ma-
hone said she thought the clip was 
offensive.
“It would be nice if producers, 
show creators and writers were 
more mindful of what they are say-‘Family Guy’ references, teases UF in Sunday’s episode

With the trauma of the 
Newtown, Conn., massacre 
still lingering, the Association of American Universities has called upon President Barack Obama and members of Con-gress to address gun violence.
In the statement issued 
Thursday, the association, com-prised of 62 universities includ-ing UF, is pushing for the fed-eral government to reform gun laws.
While UF is in the associa-
tion, Director of Public Affairs Janine Sikes said it is not a UF-related initiative and was unaware if UF has taken any stance.
Jodine Castin, a 22-year-old 
health education and behavior senior, said she was glad the as-
sociation was calling for action.
“Part of my fear was that it 
would be forgotten,” she said. 
“There needs to be at least one law made.”
Stating that schools have 
become “centers for national mourning,” the statement is-sued by the executive commit-
tee has asked that action occur 
on three domains: gun control, care of the mentally ill and the culture of the contemporary media.

can Universities has joined more than 300 college presi-dents who have signed Col-

A University Police officer who 
served with the department for 
about four years died in a traffic 
accident Friday in Orlando.
Officer Jean-Guy Deffense, 43, 
was driving west on an entrance 
ramp from State Road 408 onto 
Florida’s Turnpike, according to a 
Florida Highway Patrol accident report.
Deffense lost control of his 
2008 Dodge Ram 1500 as he drove 
around a curve. 
The truck veered into a grass 
shoulder, rolled over, struck a 
metal pole and came to a stop on 
its roof, according to the report.
Emergency officials who 
responded to the accident 
pronounced Deffense, who was wearing his seatbelt, dead at the 
scene.
His wife, Marcia Wolf, 45, was 
also in the car and did not suffer any injuries.
She was also wearing her 
seatbelt, according to the report.
Deffense was an active 
member of the UPD honor guard 
and a sniper rifleman in the 
department’s Critical Incident 
Response Team.
UPD spokesman Maj. Brad 
Barber said Deffense worked as a road patrol officer.
He was off duty at the time of 
the accident.
A memorial service for Deffense will be held at the Canterbury Showplace Center, located at 23100 W. Newberry 
Road, at noon Wednesday, 
according to the UPD Facebook 
page.
Barber described Deffense as 
a role model for other officers in 
the department.
“Officer Deffense was a consummate law enforcement professional,” he said. “An excellent example for all to 
emulate.”
The Deffense family is asking 
the public for all donations to be made to the Alachua County 
Humane Society.

THREATENED TO KILL 
THE VICTIM, 
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT.
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Staff Writer
A Gainesville man who 
allegedly stole a car and 
threatened his friend was 
arrested Sunday afternoon.
The Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office charged Blake Summerlin, 28, of 4323 NW 21st Place, with grand theft auto, a third-degree felony, 
according to an ASO arrest 
report.
At about 2:40 p.m. 
Sunday, deputies responded 
to a report about a stolen 
car at the Scottish Inn Hotel, located in the 4000 block of Southwest 13th Street.
When deputies arrived 
at the scene, the victim told 
police that Summerlin had 
driven his 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer the night before when they were out at a bar.
The next day, Summerlin 
picked up the victim and drove back to the hotel. 
When they arrived, the 
two men started arguing.
The victim told Summerlin 
to give him the keys, but Summerlin refused, saying “I’m taking your truck and when I get back I’m going to kill you,” according to the report.
Summerlin then took the 
car and fled the scene.
After interviewing 
the victim, deputies later contacted OnStar and found the car in the Arredondo Farms mobile home park, 
located in the 7000 block of 
S o u t h w e s t 
A r c h e r 
Road.
At the 
park, police confronted Summerlin and arrested 
him.
During questioning, 
Summerlin told deputies he 
stole the car so he could go to a woman’s house.
Summerlin later changed 
his story, saying he borrowed the car with the victim’s permission.
He said he wasn’t aware 
the car was reported stolen, according to the report.
This is not Summerlin’s 
first run-in with police. 
In 2007, he was arrested on 
robbery charges, according to court records from the Alachua County Clerk of 
Court.
Police booked Summerlin 
into the Alachua County Jail. 
By Monday night, he was released.

IN MEMORIAMing and recognize they are talking about 
people,” she said.
Kristen Oliff, a 18-year-old marine sci-
ence freshman, said she was shocked when she saw the clip.
“I feel like we were unrightfully tar -
geted,” she said. “I don’t know what we 
did.”
The joke played on the stereotypes of 
mental illness and being a Floridian, Ma-
hone said.
She said she thinks the general associa-
tion of Floridians being dumb stems from the 2000 election vote-count fiasco and the similar situation last November.
Students should not worry about the 
episode tainting the university’s reputa-
tion, Mahone said.
“I definitely don’t think ‘Family Guy’ 
was accurate in its labeling of UF students,” 
she said. “UF is quite difficult to get into. I 
couldn’t have gotten in here when I was 
applying to undergrad, so I don’t think be-ing fodder for a ‘Family Guy’ joke really should be cause for concern as far as our reputation.”

Gainesville Police is looking 
for a man wanted in connec-
tion to a string of November motorcycle thefts in southwest Gainesville.
Larry Eugene Stone, 41, of 
Gainesville, remains at large for allegedly stealing motorcycles along Southwest 20th Avenue, said GPD spokesman Ben To-bias on Monday.
Stone was last spotted in the 
Haile Plantation area and is de-scribed as a 5-foot-6-inch white 
male weighing 235 pounds, po-
lice said. Tobias said Stone has multiple warrants for his arrest and may possibly be armed.In November, GPD received 
reports about an increase in motorcycles thefts, according to a GPD news release.
On Nov. 16, detectives locat-
ed and arrested Daniel Roane, 21, as one of the suspects con-nected to the alleged thefts following an unrelated distur -
bance call.
During an interview with 
detectives, Roane admitted to stealing eight motorcycles with Stone, who he said planned the thefts and made arrangements to sell parts in exchange for methamphetamine.
Police learned that Stone 
and Roane would steal Suzuki GSX-R and Honda CBR mo-torcycles in student apartment complexes.
Roane told detectives he 
looked for bikes that were not chained. If they did not have a lock, he could hot-wire the mo-torcycle and drive them away , according to the release.
Police charged Roane with 
eight counts of grand theft auto, eight counts of dealing in stolen property and eight counts of conspiracy to commit grand theft auto.
Tobias said the department 
will continue to follow leads.
“We’re still very much look-
ing for him,” he said.

please contact GPD Detective Juan DeCastro at 352-393-7665 or text “GPDFL” plus your tip to 274637.

Alachua County residents look-
ing to obtain or renew their driver’s 
licenses may soon enjoy shorter wait times and more locations.
The Alachua County Department 
of Motor Vehicles will be merging with the Alachua County Tax Col-lector’s office next month as part of a Florida Legislature mandate.
John Power, chief deputy at the 
Alachua County Tax Collector’s Of-fice, said tax collector offices across the state have already begun to merge with local DMV offices, which 
include offices in nearby Clay and 
Putnam counties.
In February, he said, county resi-
dents can start receiving driver’s licence services at the tax collector’s downtown office, located at 12 SE First St.
On March 11, the DMV office on 
Northwest 34th Street will close, and 
the tax collector’s office across the 
street, located at 5801 NW 34th Blvd., will begin providing the same driv-er’s license services. The office will also assume the lease on the former DMV building and continue to use the driving course for road tests.
In May, the merge will be com-
plete when the tax collector’s office in 
Butler Plaza begins issuing licenses.  
“We think it will be a big win for 
the public because they’ll have three 
choices instead of one,” Power said. “The current driver’s license office is only staffed by 11 people, which 
leads to a lot of customer frustration. 
When we take it over, we’ll have 35 front-counter customer service rep-resentatives handling transactions between the three offices.”
The tax collector offices currently 
conduct about 150,000 transactions each year. Power said he expects to see a 30 percent increase in transac-
tions once tax collector’s offices be-
come responsible for licenses.
Before the merge, residents had to 
go to two different agencies to con-duct vehicle-related business.
Now, residents can go to any of 
the three tax collector’s offices to renew their car tag and renew their driver’s licenses.
“We believe bringing the driver’s 
licenses on will make us more of a one-stop shop,” Power said.
Melissa Lopez, a 23-year-old zool-
ogy senior, said shutting down the DMV office is a good idea.
“I think it’s more convenient for 
everybody,” she said.
However, Leah Harding, a 
20-year-old Arabic and telecommu-nication major, said the problem of long lines may transfer over to the tax collector’s office once the switch 
happens.
“I know DMVs are notoriously 
bad for long lines, so I can see that 
being a problem,” she said.DMV to close in merge

fAmiL y guy , from page 1The joke played on the stereotypes 
of mental illness and FloridiansAAU statement criticizes media
an open letter demanding Congress pass 
stricter gun control laws.  
UF has not signed the list, which is made 
up of mostly private colleges.
Criminology and sociology professor 
Ronald Akers said he thought the associa-tion’s requests were reasonable and sup-ported the call.
“The passage and outcome of any policy 
changes will be more symbolic than actu-ally effective in dealing with or preventing events such as at Sandy Hook elementary,” Akers wrote in an email.
Stating that mental illness has played 
a role in mass violence in America, the as-sociation has requested more thorough ex-aminations of the treatment of the mentally ill in the search for ways to extinguish mass violence. 
The Association of American Universi-
ties has also called for a ban of assault rifles and high-capacity magazines.
Yet, Akers said higher levels of gun vio-
lence are often found in stronger gun con-trol jurisdictions.
“Whatever failures of gun control that 
can be identified  in such instances predict too much,” Akers wrote. “The same failures are found all over the place without the same outcomes.”
Linda Nhon’s approval of tighter gun 
control by the federal government was heightened after she left a Largo, Fla., music venue, and two gunshots were fired when a fight broke out.
“There were kids there,” said the 
21-year-old microbiology junior. “It makes me feel unsafe to go to public places, espe-cially around my own peers.”
Sydney Madrigal, a 19-year-old psy-
chology freshman, is also in support of 
more regulations when it comes to buying 
a weapon.
While the association is focused on gun 
control and mental illness, the statement also points blame to the media, which they said is fueling crime with their “addiction to violence.”
“The exposure to media portrayals of 
violence in American society is very wide-
spread, so there should be very large, even 
massive numbers of such incidents,” Akers said. “Yet there are relatively few, so few that when they occur they attract enormous attention.”
Akers said the policy changes that stem 
from traumatic events can reach a level of moral panic that produces strong public fear.
“Once the policy changes are made we 
tend to think we have fixed the problem, but the evidence and the probability that any of the recommended actions will have real, meaningful and consequential out-comes is pretty low,” he said.

A group of Gainesville residents will give a pre-
sentation to the Alachua County Commission at 5 
p.m. today pushing for a law to reduce wage theft 
crimes across the county.
Wage theft is a crime that affects employers and 
workers nationwide and across Florida, said Diana 
Moreno, spokeswoman for the Alachua County 
Wage Theft Task Force.
Moreno, 25, said wage theft happens when 
workers are not paid what they’re owed by their 
employers, such as not being paid for overtime work.
“After a month, it could add up to hours that 
you’re working for free,” she said.
A 2011 study by the Research Institute on Social 
and Economic Policy Center for Labor Research 
and Studies from Florida International University 
found 3,036 wage violations reported to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division in Florida.
More than $28 million of unpaid wages have 
been recovered by the U.S. Department of Labor, according to the study.
Wage theft can also occur when workers do not 
receive their ﬁ  nal paycheck after quitting or get-
ting ﬁ  red from a job.
 This means having to go through a difﬁ  cult le-gal process, she said.
“There are a lot of occasions where people just 
give up and don’t get paid at all,” Moreno said.
The presentation will discuss wage theft from a 
small business perspective.
Several local businesses, including Satchel’s 
Pizza, The Lunch Box and Big Lou’s Pizza, have endorsed the task force’s ordinance.
“They understand they would rather compete 
in an even playing ﬁ  eld with their competitors,” 
Moreno said.
Moreno said if the ordinance passes through 
the county commission, it will help prevent future 
wage theft incidents from happening between 
workers and employers.
“We want to use this ordinance not only to re-
cover wages from workers, but to identify small 
businesses who may be struggling to update their 
payroll system and offer them services through the 
county that can help them succeed,” she said.

40 TOTAL VOTESAcross India, people are holding protests in outrage 
over the brutal gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman that occurred in New Delhi last month.
Every detail that emerged on the story is more horrify-
ing than the last — how the five men attacked the woman and her friend with a metal rod and knocked the friend un-conscious, then proceeded to beat the woman with the rod while the men took turns raping her. The men even used the rusted L-shaped metal rod to sexually assault the woman, using it with such force that it ripped out intestines, before they dumped the naked woman and man out of the back of the moving bus. 
My first reaction to this horrible event was to fall to 
that age-old assurance that something so terrible wouldn’t happen in America. It had to have taken place in another country . That was the only logical reason why passersby stared and pointed from their cars and bikes and then sped off without calling police when both victims lay under the overpass naked, bleeding and pleading for help. That had to 
be the reason why it took both victims almost two hours to 
reach a hospital.
But to be honest, nothing prevents an incident like that 
from occurring in the U.S. Terrible people will still cause ter -
rible events, regardless of their location. But, what us Ameri-cans can take away from this event is that a country’s attitude toward rape tends to be shown in how that country creates laws to protect its victims. In India, rape is still considered so shameful that many women do not come forward to report it. Protesters in India right now are angry that police and 
politicians often downplay the seriousness of the situation 
instead of investigating cases and creating new laws.
But that’s just India, right? Surely our government is 
more progressive, and we don’t need to worry about some-thing that tragic.
In the same weeks that the brutal rape of the woman from 
New Delhi was covered, the U.S. Congress killed the renew-al for a bill called the Violence Against Women Act. 
The bill supported organizations that served domes-tic abuse victims and had been passed into law in 1994 and reau-thorized again in 2000 and 2005, but this time there was a hitch. People wanted to include three new groups of women in the bill: LGBT individuals, Native Ameri-
cans living on reservations and il-
legal immigrants.
If there was a sound in the 
House of Representatives when this crazy new idea was an-nounced, it was the collective sound of Republicans’ teeth grinding as they thought of gay and illegal immigrant wom-en getting anything out of the government.
OK, that got a little dark, but in all seriousness, the House 
Republican leaders made it a point to not put the bill up for a vote, so it was not reinstated into law. Talk about a move purely for ideologies’ sake that wasn’t made in the best inter -
ests of the women at all.
Sometimes Americans tend to believe if something isn’t 
talked about, it isn’t a problem.
A consequence of life, perhaps, but not a problem.Legislation may get passed when times get tough, but 
a few years down the road, a new group of politicians and 
Americans will challenge its value by saying that it’s no lon-
ger needed.
My point is American citizens should stay vigilant on 
how our government handles protection for women be-cause, if all of the laws fall away , it will make a very real difference in everyone’s day-to-day life.
We have a responsibility to get angry and let our voices 
be heard when our government fails to do enough; just like 
protesters in India have been doing. In that regard, our situ-
ations are truly the same.

Her columns run on Tuesdays.New Delhi rape is America’s wake-upOb-eats-ity: 
Be more aware of 
your health
Know yourself, know your body.
It’s the only one you have, so please at least try to 
treat it with respect and awareness. On the other hand, 
it’s your body , so you’re going to do whatever you want with it 
no matter what anybody tells you.
Just know the risks.A recent survey found that “many Americans know about 
heart disease and diabetes as major health risks from obesity, but few realize other conditions including cancer, arthritis, sleep apnea and infertility are tied to having excess weight,” accord-ing to a CBS News article. 
It’s like no one knows what can happen due to obesity. The 
effects are more than just heart disease and diabetes.
“Heart disease is the nation’s leading killer, and diabetes and 
obesity are twin epidemics, as rates of both have climbed in re-cent years,” according to the article.
Because obesity is a growing epidemic in this country , it’s 
time to realize what it can do to us.
By the way, shout out to the Supreme “Pizza” Court for prob-
ably helping the childhood obesity problem get worse. Way to go, guys, for making something that is barely nutritious become a vegetable on a technicality.
If your government wants to tax unhealthy foods or reduce 
the size of soft drinks sold, you should probably let them.
In the survey’s responses, people barely mentioned cancer, 
infertility, joint pain, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and strokes as other possible effects from obesity. Not to mention some respiratory problems could also stem from it.
We think it’s important to take care of yourself. When we’re 
here at college, potentially hours from where we call home, it can be really easy to let some things go.
Are you more likely to eat fast food here than you are back 
home? Maybe it’s difficult to get to a grocery store or to buy the right food. Do you consider yourself to be a stress-eater, or someone who eats more when they’re under more stress here at school? That’s an added worry that may not exist back home, either.
We’re on our own.Luckily, and somehow, we’re not on our own all alone. All of 
us are here to survive by our own tenacity. Attack this new year and new semester by arming yourself with knowledge.
Most of the classes you’re taking are to get you through grad-
uation, but you also need to take this time to learn things that are important for life beyond campus.
“Knowing more about the myriad ways obesity affects health 
could help motivate people to get more active and eat better be-fore full-blown disease strikes,” said Jennifer Dimitriou, a dieti-tian at New York’s Montefiore Medical Center, in the article. 
We have to be responsible adults now, whether we like it or 
not. So, suck it up, folks. You’re in charge now. You’re calling all 
the shots in your life. Have all the fun you care to have.
Just remember that the buck, and the risk, stops with youCongratulations! Don’t be like the rest of America because 
our country is full of dumb-dumbs. Be better, be smarter.

I don’t know much about Columbine, Col, or Aurora, 
Col., or Oak Creek, Wisc., or Tuscon, Ariz., or even the Virginia Tech community. All I know about these places 
are the images and the numbers: the 12 students in that high school, the 12 people in the movie theater, the six members of the Sikh temple in their place of worship, the six constitu-ents and their miraculously recovered congresswoman in 
a Safeway parking lot and the 32 college students on their 
beloved campus. I saw the images of horror, of panic, from mothers, fathers, friends and loved ones. I saw the pictures of the vigils and the intensified police and media responses. I heard the extended news stories from CNN and Fox. And 
when I hear the names of these communities, that is what I 
see. I see these tragedies and I think of the victims.
But I know Newtown, Conn. It’s my home. It’s where I 
grew up and attended elementary and middle school. And I 
know that it’s more than this tragedy. It’s more than the im-
ages you’re going to see on TV and on the front page of The Washington Post or The New York Times. Newtown is more than the aerial views of Sandy Hook Elementary School you’ll continue to see. It’s more than the SWAT teams that 
lined our streets on Friday. It’s more than what Brian Wil-
liams will tell you on NBC Nightly News. Newtown is more than the ultra-politicized and sensationalized news stories you’ll continue to hear.
Newtown is a place where Father Bob would surprise ev-
ery class in my grade school with a trip across the street to The Ice Cream Shop. It’s a place where Eunice from Bagel Man would tell you not to worry about that last 50 cents or dollar you were missing on your order of bagels. It’s a place 
where the Paproski family would spend months designing 
and creating a gigantic corn maze at their family’s farm so that, every fall, children could come and get lost for hours with their friends. Newtown is a place where, every Hallow-
een, the historic homes on Main Street decorate their porch-
es with cob webs and scarecrows for the trick-or-treaters. Newtown is a place where, every summer, St. Rose of Lima Parish pulls together an entire community effort to host the Summer Carnival in the parking lot and field. And New-
town is a place where our parents, teachers, priests, minis-
ters and rabbis love our children so passionately that there would be no keeping them from the sidelines of our soccer or lacrosse games or from being our volunteer coaches or 
field trip leaders.
If I could meet anyone from Columbine, Aurora, Oak 
Creek, Tuscon or Virginia Tech, I’d ask them about their 
communities. I’d want to hear stories like this. I’d want to know what they love most about home. Because we are more than this.
It saddens me so deeply to know 
that my family, my best friends from 
grade school and my whole commu-
nity are not the only ones who know this grief. Within the 
past 10 years, we’ve watched as this epidemic of violence has spread through our country. We’ve watched as young 
kids of my own generation have become subjected to a cul-
ture where plastic guns are acceptable toys and you only win video games if you’ve killed enough of “the enemy.” And we’ve watched as mental and social disorders have left people so isolated they are essentially alone.
The problem is deep. It’s cultural, it’s social and it will 
take generations to fix. But the change needs to start right now. And while beginning this change will make our schools, malls, temples and movie theaters safer places for 
my generation’s, or the next generation’s, children to be, it 
will not save the town that this may happen in tomorrow, or next week, or next month. 
We need to take action right now.Our “right to bear arms” was something given to us by 
a generation who fought revolutions in their backyards. We don’t have that war anymore. We have a different kind of war now, a war where arming ourselves will only spread the fear and the violence. 
It hurts me to know that these pleas and demands for 
change get slowed down by lobbyists, politics and legisla-tion because this isn’t about what party is dominant in the House or Senate: This is about our lives and our children’s lives. 
To me, there is an easy solution in front of us. We take 
away the violence and we take away the guns. But Washing-ton won’t hear these pleas until we can all put our politics — or who we voted for in November — aside and realize that, 
every day, we are losing children, mothers and fathers. 
We are losing our communities.
When you hear “Newtown, Connecticut,” please do think 
of those 20 children and seven adults who lost their lives on Dec. 14. 
Please do remember the images you saw on the news and 
the pictures of grief that spread across the country. Don’t forget about what happened.
But please, also remember that Newtown is a home that 
will not stop growing.

At the dawn of each new year, most of 
us select one goal to achieve in the next 365 days. New Year’s resolutions are a 
tradition we have a hard time dismissing.
As hard as it may be to conjure up ideas 
for resolutions, by far the most difficult part is sticking to them.
The problem with New Year’s Eve promis -
es is that they are often entirely unachievable.  
Let’s say you have a typical college student 
dependency on caffeine and you vow, as the ball drops in New York City, to stop drinking coffee forever — cold turkey.
You’re going to reach a critical point. There 
will be a moment when you cross central cam-pus on your way to class after pulling an all-nighter, and you start eyeballing the Caribou Coffee.
You’ll probably be able to smell the rich 
cafe scent, and, pretty soon, all you can think about is getting that glorious caffeine in your body.
The “cold turkey” method of quitting or 
changing anything works for very few people. Instead, if you truly want your resolutions to last through the year (or several years), you must make your objectives quantifiable. If you, like the person in the earlier scenario, are 
too dependent on cof-fee, limit yourself to a specific allotment of caffeinated drinks per 
week or even day.
Likewise, if your resolution is to drop a few 
pounds, you probably won’t get anywhere by 
swearing to eat only salad for months and run five miles a day. Instead, maybe try counting calories and lessening how many you intake by a measurable amount each day.
As well as being measurable, your goals 
for your New Year’s resolution need to be 
amendable. The best way to do it is to start 
with a small but extremely achievable objec-tive. If you can manage to pull that off for a month or two, make your goals more strict and exact.
If you are cutting calories, perhaps take 200 
off your daily diet for a month. During the next month, cut back another 200. If you feel that your fun weekend life is seeping into your 
education and damaging your schoolwork, 
have one drink less or stay at home studying one night more. It may seem like these adjust-ments are too small, but they are manageable and will, over time, make a difference.
Similarly, if the goals that you have set for 
yourself are way out of reach, change them in-stead of giving them up entirely.
But think for a moment about how you 
want 2013 to turn out and what you can do to make it happen. It could be just another nor -
mal year, but it could also be much more than that. 
Whether you are trying to be more daring, 
or happier, or learn a new language, you have the ability to make 2013 very exciting.
Change isn’t easy for anyone, but with a 
new year comes endless potential for a new, 
or at least slightly different, life.
But maybe you really don’t think there is a 
resolution you can stick to. 
Or maybe you really don’t need to change. 
In any case, I’ve found that the easiest way 
to not break any resolutions is to not make them at all.

After her first day of her Fall intern-
ship, UF senior Shelley Greenspan got 
to experience what most people only see on TV .
The 22-year-old political science and 
public relations student got a tour of the West Wing.
“While to many working there it be-
comes norm to casually stroll through the historic halls, I was taken aback,” she wrote in an email. “Embarrassingly, I started to cry, because I was so over -
whelmed at the moment.”
Greenspan was one of about 100 
people who interned at the White House during Fall 2012. As an intern, she was in the Department of Presidential Per -
sonnel on the National Security team. She conducted records checks and legal research for presidential and political appointees at the departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security and Vet-eran’s Affairs, among others.
As part of the internship, Greenspan 
got to listen to Vice President Joe Biden. She said she was blown away by his “humility and candor.”
“I remember he said ‘I know what 
it’s like to look someone in the eye who isn’t able to provide for their family . . . and that’s why we’re in this,’” she wrote. “And yes, he’s as funny and charismatic 
in person as he seems on TV .”
This wasn’t Greenspan’s first intern-
ship in D.C. During Summer 2010, she 
interned for Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
“Greenspan’s passion for politics 
and enthusiasm to learn is infectious to anyone around her and reflects tremen-dously in the work she performs,” said 
Gator alumna Stacy Eichner, 22.
Greenspan said this experience re-
stored her faith in the government.
“I’m sure many of us became dis-
couraged from things we saw on TV 
during the election, and this internship really just confirmed my decision to pursue a career in public service,” she said.But she will always remember the 
moment she spent with the First Dog. When she was giving a tour of the East Wing, Bo came running and brushed up beside her.“Of course after the internship, I 
bought my own stuffed animal ver -
sion,” Greenspan said.

Nine years ago, Calvin Lee lay 
in a hospital bed awaiting a kid-
ney transplant from his mother. But last summer, the 20-year-old found himself living his dream — rapping about his hometown in a recording studio.
Lee was born with acute renal 
failure, a disease that affected his kidneys. Although he received a donor transplant at birth, Lee was admitted into Shands Hospital for Children at UF at age 11 in need of another transplant.
He is one of 12 former Shands 
patients involved in the Milestone Campaign, a program by Dance Marathon at UF. The campaign, which began in summer 2012, aims to give these children the op-portunity to live out their dream.
“It’s so nice to see the kids so 
happy,” said Dance Marathon Family Relations Overall Chair Sam Burd.
After his transplant, Lee began 
to pursue his dream of being a rapper.
Burd reached out to Gaines-
ville’s Skylab Recording Studios owner, Gerry King, to land a re-cording session for Lee.
“[King] really wanted to make 
it the best day of Calvin’s life,” said the 22-year old occupational therapy grad student.King met with Lee in July to 
discuss the song and began re-cording “Swamp Life” about his favorite team, the Gators, and his hometown, Gainesville, in Au-gust.
King gave Lee a free seven-
hour recording session, which would have cost about $1,000.
“This was something we did 
out of our hearts and for Calvin,” King said.
Now, Lee is taking a break from Santa Fe College and is thinking about enrolling in barber school. He also plans to perform at Dance Marathon this year.
Lee said he was thankful to 
Dance Marathon for helping him live out his dream of being a rap-per.
“It put a smile on my face,” 
Lee said. “It just motivated me more.”

Chemistry freshman Josue Romero piled his books 
and supplies high in his arms while waiting for the reg-
ister at the UF Bookstore. 
He said his theater appreciation books, biology bun-
dle and paper supplies will cost him about $250. 
The 18-year-old said he noticed the steep price of 
textbooks last semester when he spent $300 on books alone.
UF Bookstore director Lynne Vaughan, who has 
been working at the bookstore for about 12 years, said although the price of textbooks has gone up, everything else has also due to inflation.
A recent report found that textbook prices have in-
creased 812 percent since 1978, which is faster than the 
rate of the consumer price index, which has increased 
250 percent, according to the American Enterprise In-stitute.
Vaughan said publishers set the price of their books 
to make a profit and release new editions with better photography and paper. 
According to the U.S. Public Interest Group, editions 
are released on average every four years.
“That quality doesn’t come free,” she said.Vaughan said the university tries to keep costs down 
for students by offering more options, such as used 
books, textbook rentals and textbook deferment.
Vaughan said the most expensive books are the bun-
dles with CDs and online components since students 
cannot resell they can only be used once. She said the best deal is to rent or buy used books.
She estimated that students spend $400 to $500 on 
average for books per semester.
Romero said he tries to keep books affordable by 
paying for them with textbook deferment and reselling them after the semester is over to make a profit.
“UF has a little black market when it comes to text-
book exchange,” he said.

The Student Senate unanimously passed 
funding for tabletop gaming last month.
Student Government will provide Delta 
Nu Delta, a gaming organization, with 
$1,133. The measure approved funds for advertising, including banner and Face-book ads, fliers and cards and games.
Delta Nu Delta President David Was-
serman and treasurer Josh Cruz presented 
their plan at the meeting.
“The game room has been in need for 
revitalization for a while, in my opinion,” 
said Wasserman, a 22-year-old sustainabil-
ity senior.
He said the games would have a shelf 
life of two years, and parts of the games, instead of the whole games, could be re-placed. The games will be stored in the Re-itz Union game room.
The organization is starting with 10 
tabletop games, including Munchkin and Ticket to Ride, and plans to build up its collection. They also plan to order classic games 
like Monopoly and Risk.
Cruz, a 19-year-old finance sophomore, 
said they plan to order the games within 
the next two months.
“Personally, I’m excited because we 
have games that all students can play,” 
Cruz said.  “You try them out. Some you 
like and some you don’t. It should be fun for everyone.”

Conversations in coffee shops 
have gone on to inspire a book 
that in part will raise money for 
the American Cancer Society.
Nikolas Wong, a 21-year-old UF 
criminology junior, has published 
a series of 10 short satire stories 
titled “The Coffee House.” Each 
story within the book looks at dif-ferent people’s conversations over coffee. Many of the coffee shops are inspired by local places, such 
as the Starbucks on Archer Road 
or Karma Cream, Wong said. A 
Starbucks in Miami was also an 
influence.
The book is dedicated to his 
Aunt May, who is currently bat-
tling cancer and was diagnosed in 
2007. Her personality inspired him 
to write the books. She has a dark sense of humor that is reflected in the nature of the stories.
“Her good sense of humor 
keeps her spirits high,” Wong said. “It’s the best healing method.”
Because of Aunt May, he is do-
nating a portion of the profits from 
the book to the American Cancer 
Society. He sells paperbacks on Amazon for $10, and digital copies will soon be available for down-
load, he said. Wong said he’s not 
in it for personal money, but in-stead because he wants to make a difference. He’s been in contact 
with the American Cancer Society, 
and they plan to work together.
Wong’s friends were also inspi-
ration for the book. He said that 
during high school, his friends 
would join him to get coffee and ended up having immature but 
heartwarming conversations.
When he transferred to UF last 
Fall, he didn’t know many people. 
Wong relied on the familiarity of coffee shops to help him ease into 
life in Gainesville. When he joined 
UF’s Sparks Magazine, he was in-spired to compile many of his ex-periences into a book.
Wong said he has always want-
ed to write. This year, he became a registered author with the Library of Congress.
He used an independent pub-
lisher, www.createspace.com, to print his book. By doing that, he said, it was easier to donate mon-ey. Most of the book was spon-
sored through donations.
He drew his own illustrations 
and a friend, a UF fine arts stu-
dent, did the cover art.
One of Wong’s favorite stories 
in the book is the second to last: a conversation that takes place on Mother’s Day between a son and 
his mother. The tale is told from 
the point of view of the son and explores his embarrassment while his mother discusses the pains of 
his birth in a place as public as a 
Starbucks.
Wong said one of his funniest 
stories is the true account of a con-versation he had with his friend, 
in which his friend discussed as-
pects of his risqué lifestyle. He said all of the stories in the book are based on true conversations 
and most of the names are the 
same. His friends’ reactions have been positive — most of them are 
excited to see their names printed 
in the book.
“One of my favorite reactions 
would happen during the editing 
process, when my friends would 
see my typos and laugh,” Wong said. “But I loved to see when they would open the book and smile.”
Perhaps one of Wong’s most 
touching stories is his last short story, a one page account that he wrote for a girl. In it, he uses Kar -
ma Cream as a backdrop while he 
discusses making contact with a 
girl he admires.
Wong has plans for at least two 
more books and has already start-ed the second book, which might 
have a subtitle of “Decaf.” He says 
hints of a second book can be seen in the first.
Jane Yun, 17, a senior at Oak 
Hall High School; Grace Lee, 17, a senior at Eastside High School; and Katie Lee, 18, also a senior at Eastside High School; said they would be interested in reading 
Wong’s book. They were studying 
Monday afternoon in another fa-miliar coffee destination: Panera.
“It would be interesting to read 
a book based on where you lived,” Yun said. “And it would be funny to know that you’ve been there.”
“It would be even funnier if 
you knew the people,” Grace Lee 
added.
Wong said he hopes the book 
becomes popular.
“I just want to share it with 
other UF students because I think 
they’ll enjoy it,” he said. “Plus, many of my friends who inspired me to write the book go to UF, so I want to give them more credit. 
There is really a lot of UF embed-
ded in the book.”TUESDAY, JANUARY 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Jelani Jenkins stands on the sidelines and watches Florida’s 33-23 loss against Louisville in the Sugar 
Bowl on Jan. 2 in New Orleans. Jenkins will forego his senior season and declare for the NFL Draft. 
 �FOUR FLORIDA JUNIORS HAVE 
DECIDED TO GO PRO.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
The Gators’ list of early departures 
continues to grow.
Weakside linebacker Jelani Jenkins 
announced on Monday his decision 
to declare for the NFL Draft via a UF release. Jenkins is the fourth UF junior 
who has decided to go pro.
“Jelani informed me that he wishes 
to pursue his dream of playing in the 
NFL,” coach Will Muschamp said in a statement. “We wish him the best of 
luck and encourage him to return to 
Florida and complete his degree.”
Jenkins follows safety Matt Elam, 
defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd and tight 
end Jordan Reed in forgoing his final 
year of eligibility to play in the NFL 
next season.
Defensive end Dominique Eas-
ley will remain at UF. He announced 
his decision on Monday night in a post from his Twitter account (@MR_ChUcKiE_2).
Jenkins’ final season in Gainesville 
was an injury-riddled campaign.
Thumb, hamstring and foot inju-ries sidelined Jenkins for four games, 
including Florida’s 33-23 loss to Louis-
ville in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 2. In lim-ited action, Jenkins recorded 29 tackles, 
five tackles for a loss, two sacks, two 
quarterback hurries and an intercep-
tion.
Perhaps Jenkins’ most memorable 
play from his final season at UF came in 
a 27-20 win against Louisiana on Nov. 10 in The Swamp. With the score tied 20-20, cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy blocked a Ragin’ Cajuns punt. Jenkins caught the deflection on the fly and ran it back 36 yards for the go-ahead touch-down to help the Gators avoid the big-gest upset in school history.
Freshman Antonio Morrison will 
step up in Jenkins’ absence next sea-son much like he did throughout 2012. Morrison led all UF freshmen with 34 tackles. He also recorded two tack-les for loss, a sack and a quarterback hurry.
Morrison changed the momentum 
in Florida’s 37-26 win against Florida State on Nov. 24 with a key play early in the fourth quarter. With the Gators trailing 20-16, Morrison sacked EJ Manuel, forcing a fumble recovered by Easley.
On the next play, UF took the lead Jenkins declares for NFL 
Draft, Easley staying at UF

In a contentious Southeastern Con-
ference, every game is a battle for a 
youthful Florida squad. That’s when the Gators turn to their floor general, Jaterra Bonds. 
The junior point guard has become 
Florida’s leader. Coping with numerous injuries and an inexperienced roster, but the Gators rely on Bonds to bring a high level of intensity into each game.
“It’s really tough to question her fire 
as a teammate or as a coach because she goes so hard all the time,” coach Aman-da Butler said. “It’s not just what you see 
on the game floor. That’s on the practice 
floor every single day .” 
Bonds barks out orders during the 
game like a general on the battlefield. She positions her troops accordingly.
In a 77-72 victory against LSU on 
Sunday, Bonds was especially vocal. 
With 4:22 remaining in the first half and UF on defense, Christin Mercer tum-bled into the scorers’ table attempting to corral a deflected pass. When the Tigers retrieved the loose ball, Bonds wasted no time in reconfiguring the defense.
“Come on,” Bonds implored Mercer. 
“Get up.”
Mercer scrambled to rejoin her gen-
eral in battle. The Gators forced a shot clock violation just nine seconds later.
B u t l e r , 
who stresses the impor -
tance of de-fense, roared with approv-
al. 
“I think our younger players, in par -
ticular, are very responsive and want to be right there with [Bonds], side by side, shoulder to shoulder, in the thick of the battle,” Butler said. 
If the floor is Bonds’ battlefield, the 
paint is her trenches. Guard leading youthful teamMEN’S BASKETBALL

When No. 11 Florida traveled to New Ha-
ven, Conn., to face Yale, the game was going 
to be a homecoming of sorts for senior Erik Murphy. The South Kingstown, R.I., native planned on having family and friends make 
the hour long trip to watch him play Sunday 
night.
But the trip didn’t work out as expected. Family and friends watched as the Gators 
defeated the Bulldogs 79-58 with Murphy sidelined. The 6-foot-10 forward missed his first game since a 72-68 loss at Syracuse on Dec. 2, 2011, after fracturing one of his ribs during Friday’s practice.
“I had broken two (ribs) in college and it 
was probably a good four to six weeks before 
I was pain free,” coach Billy Donovan said. 
“When it is a bruise, it is probably going to be a week to 10 days.”
Murphy first experienced discomfort on 
Dec. 29, during Florida’s 78-61 victory against Air Force in Sunrise. 
Despite taking a hit, Murphy continued 
to play. The senior stayed on the court for 29 minutes, led the Gators with 21 points on 
8-of-10 shooting and tallied seven rebounds, 
four assists and three blocks in the win.  
After returning from the game, Murphy 
participated in the next three practices with-out a problem. But after making contact with a teammate during Friday’s practice, Murphy was ruled out for Sunday’s game. 
“[The injury is] in a really, really bad spot,” 
Donovan said. “So anytime he raises his arms 
up, or lifts his arm or reaches his arms up, 
there’s a significant amount of pain.” 
Donovan briefly included Murphy in the 
team shootaround before Florida faced Yale, but the pain was too much for the senior to play.
Murphy didn’t practice on Monday, and 
Donovan doesn’t anticipate that he will practice on Tuesday either. He is doubtful Forward doubtful for SEC openerSEE JENKINS, p AgE 14

UF coachUF W omen’s 
Bask etballUnlike most players, she gravi-
tates toward contact. Her dogged approach makes the enemy second 
guess its willingness to fight back, something her coach appreciates.
“[Bonds] got thrown around a lit-
tle bit (Sunday),” Butler said. “There were a few good collisions that hap-pened, and that is just going to hap-pen when you’ve got that level of athleticism and speed all colliding in the paint.”
The result was a few bumps and 
bruises but a solid night on both ends 
of the floor for Bonds. She scored 19 
points in the win just three days af-ter dropping 21 points in a 76-69 loss at Kentucky . 
“We go against adversity every 
day , so that wasn’t anything new for us,” Bonds said. “We were able to fight back and bounce back on our court.” 
Defeating LSU was critical for 
Florida as it battles to contend in perhaps the toughest conference in the country . Last season, the Gators finished eighth in a league that has since added Missouri and 2010-11 national champion Texas A&M.
Five SEC teams cracked the lat-
est AP Poll. To navigate through a 
tough conference slate, the Gators 
will continue to rely on Bonds. 
“If you don’t have [mental tough-
ness], you might win a few games or you might play a few good halves,” Butler said. “But if you are going to win a lot of games, if you are go-ing to do things that are special … you’ve got to be mentally tough.”

man@alligator.org.for Florida’s Southeastern Con-ference opener against Georgia on Wednesday night at 7 in the O’Connell Center. 
“He is cleared to play right 
now, but it is all up to him, (and) how much pain he can tolerate,” Donovan said. “He is not going to significantly hurt himself anymore 
because he’s going to be padded 
up. And it’s not going to be a prob-lem, but what happens is if he gets hit there or reaches and stretches, it becomes so uncomfortable.” 
In Murphy’s absence, Kenny 
Boynton and Will Yeguete both stepped up against the Bulldogs. 
Boynton tied a career-high 28 
points while adding two assists and two rebounds. Yeguete fol-lowed suit by scoring 14 points on 6-of-8 shooting and had a team-high nine rebounds. 
“Getting Will Yeguete back where he played [Sunday] with the level of intensity and passion, the things he’s capable of doing, really helped our team,” Donovan said.
Murphy has been a key part of 
the Gators’ offense, ranking sec-ond with 12.1 points per game. 
But even with Murphy doubt-
ful for Wednesday, shuffling the starting lineup is nothing new for Florida. The Gators have al-ready played four games with a shorthanded lineup due to Scottie Wilbekin’s suspension and Casey Prather’s multiple concussions.
Previously playing without its 
full roster gives Florida confidence 
as they face the possibility of los-
ing Murphy for multiple games. 
“We missed [Murphy] a lot,” 
Yeguete said. “But we’re going to find another way to play without him.”

In Wednesday’s loss to the Cardinals, Morrison re-
corded three tackles while starting in place of Jenkins, 
who was recovering from surgery on 
Nov. 26 to repair a broken bone in his right foot.
Florida defensive coordinator Dan 
Quinn, who has consistently praised the play of the Bolingbrook, Ill., na-tive since fall camp, is optimistic that switching from Jenkins to Morrison at weakside linebacker will be a seam-less transition.
“Morrison is one that’s really caught my attention,” 
Quinn said on Dec. 29, 2012. “He’s a physical guy who 
came in as a true freshman, enrolled early, was able to get the system down.   And he’s one that had to step up for 
us. … The future’s bright how he goes.”

Florida freshman Bridget Sloan 
wasn’t awestruck by the O’Connell 
Center lights during Friday’s season opener against Ball State. She has been on a bigger stage before.
Instead of falling victim to the 
pressure of her college debut, Sloan, the Gators only competing freshman against the Cardinals, set the tone from the get-go.
The former Olympian stuck her 
first exercise at Florida, earning a 9.925 on vault to share the night’s event ti-tle with All-American Ashanee Dick-
erson.
Coach Rhonda Faehn said Sloan’s 
collected debut embodies the attitude 
of the No. 3 Gators’ current crop of freshmen.
“Last year’s freshmen were a little 
bit more what we’d say ‘deer in the headlights,’” Faehn said.
“But this group of freshmen, I think 
because they’ve competed at such a high level and have been under so many pressurized situations, they re-ally don’t seem like they have trouble adjusting to this environment.” 
Sloan competed on vault at the 
2008 Beijing Olympics to help the U.S. earn a team silver medal. She is no stranger to high-level competi-tion. Neither are the other freshman 
athletes.
Florida’s Bridgette Caquatto com-
peted as a member of the U.S. Senior 
National Team in 2012. Bianca Dan-cose-Giambattisto has actively partic-ipated as a member of the Canadian National team. Morgan Frazier won 
all-around, vault and balance beam at 
the 2012 Florida Level 10 Champion-ships.
Caquatto, Dancose-Giambattisto 
and Frazier are set to make their col-lege debuts soon according to Faehn. 
Florida’s talented freshmen pro-
vide depth, which will help keep the Gators healthy and rested for later competition.
“Our other freshmen are definitely 
getting closer to being ready for com -
petition,” Faehn said. “The [fresh-men] are coming along real well.”
Faehn added that Caquatto is on 
the verge of becoming an all-around competitor, while Dancose-Giambat-tisto may perform exclusively on bars in the upcoming events. 
Faehn also said that Frazier ap-
pears ready to go on vault and may see exhibition or lineup time this Fri-day against No. 8 LSU. 
However it plays out, Faehn is 
confident in the readiness of the fresh-man class to assume lineup spots if needed and to pick up where others may leave off.
“We just want every athlete to 
push one another, so that anytime we put someone out on the competition floor, they should be able to score re-ally well no matter if they’re normally 
in the lineup or whether they feel it’s 
the first time they’ve been in it for a while,” Faehn said.
“That’s our goal.” Experienced freshmen providing depth

TUESDAY, JANUARY 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Josh: It’s no secret the Florida of-
fense was the team’s weakness throughout the 2012 season. Some 
might think it was detrimental to the Gators’ 2013 campaign that leading 
receiver Jordan Reed declared for 
the NFL Draft last weekend.
However, the defense will be 
crippled by losing defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd to the pros. 
He consistently closed running 
lanes and drew double teams to cre-ate opportunities for the rest of the defense.
Reed didn’t have the same effect 
on his teammates with his blocking, which never caught up to the rest of his game, or his receiving. He might have drawn some coverage away from his teammates, but it wasn’t enough as the team’s second-lead-ing receiver, Quinton Dunbar, had just 36 catches.
Adam: Dude, Josh. C’mon, man. 
Yes, Sharrif Floyd dominated on the defensive line and looked like the scariest person on the ﬁ  eld — sorry , Dominique Easley . You don’t mess with No. 73. But the Gators have de-fensive talent coming back.
Dante Fowler Jr. and Jonathan 
Bullard had impressive freshman seasons, which earned them both All-Southeastern Conference hon-ors. A healthy Ronald Powell, the return of Easley and those two fresh-men will make up a solid Florida de-fensive line next season.
The real loss comes at tight end 
with Reed. He led the No. 118 pass 
offense in receiving yards and re-
ceptions.
Florida heads into the offseason 
with unproven playmaking ability on the outside reminiscent of your ability to pick up girls during a night out in Gainesville. It isn’t there. 
Josh: Florida’s incoming recruits 
soften the blow of Reed’s departure. After Monday’s commitment 
from Rivals.com’s No. 5 wide receiver, Demarcus Robinson, the Gators now have ﬁ  ve re-ceivers in the fold for the class 
of 2013.
Between them and returning 
tight ends Kent Taylor and Co-
lin Thompson, it’s not much of a stretch to assume Florida can get enough production out of them to rank at least 118th in pass-ing offense again.
We do agree on one thing, 
though: Fowler and Bullard showed promise this season. But they , along with Easley , play primarily on the outside. Floyd’s 13 tackles for a loss this season were 7.5 more than any returning interior lineman.
Losing that much production, 
the Gators could very well end up more lost on defense next year than 
you were on Bourbon Street.
Adam: I was not lost. I knew exactly 
where I was going. Florida got away with lacking a consistent passing attack in every game except two — Georgia and Louisville.
Against Georgia, linebacker 
Jarvis Jones had a full serving of ga-
tor tail for breakfast, lunch and din-
ner.  In the Sugar Bowl, the Gators were too slow against the Cardinals. 
The defense let the team down 
for the ﬁ  rst time all season, and yet Floyd had two sacks and a blocked kick. Reed, dealing with pain in his left knee, caught one pass for 7 yards.
It’s unreasonable to think the 
Gators defense can bail out the of-fense consistently . They need help every now and then.
The defense’s lone pass-catch-
ing help is gone with Reed going pro.  Reed caught 28.9 percent of Jeff Driskel’s completions this past season, and if you want to play the 
“leaving game,” Florida loses four of its top six 
pass catchers.
You honestly think an offense 
ranked 104th will have an easier job replacing its top weapon in the 
passing game than the ﬁ  fth-ranked defense with more talent returning replacing its top defensive tackle? In other words, 1+1=2, Josh.
Josh: You might not have been lost, 
but your 4 a.m. text messages to me sounded like a little boy who had 
lost track of his mommy at the mall. 
The “leaving game” certainly does apply to both sides of the ball.
In Debose and Dunbar, you men-
tioned two returning pass catchers who have done something of sig-niﬁ  cance. The situation is similar at defensive tackle with Damien Jacobs and Leon Orr being the only two 
returning players with any experi-
ence. We saw ﬂ  ashes from each, but neither has proven they can contrib-ute on a consistent basis.
It’s easier to make an impact as 
a freshman from the wide receiver position than it is from defensive tackle. That’s why I’m banking on one of the young guys to step up. 
The physical transition from high 
school is tougher to make when playing right on the line of scrim-mage. That’s why Floyd’s absence will be felt in 2013.
Adam: You can’t be serious about 
Debose and Dunbar. What games have you been watching? You 
must be on Facebook too much in the press box, and quite 
frankly , you are diverting attention from the ques-tion at hand: Who will the Gators miss more — Reed 
or Floyd?
Florida won 11 games 
in spite of an anemic pass-
ing attack. Reed, the lone bright spot, is gone.
The tackles for loss, sacks and blocked kicks from Floyd can be substituted by a number of defensive playmakers on the cur-rent roster. Tell me who can emerge as a vertical threat to replace Reed?  
Without him, banking on this of-
fense to stretch the ﬁ  eld is quite a stretch.
