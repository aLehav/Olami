SNOHOMISH, Wash. (AP) — A 16-year-old boy searching 
for his cell phone in the cushions of his friend’s couch found a 
wallet with $650 inside.
Jack Wagster and friend Nick Gorman told Nick’s mother, 
who bought the couch from a couple in Kirkland, Wash.
A Facebook search found the wallet’s owner — 28-year-
old Alanna Jensen, who now lives in Arizona. She lost her bill-fold in 2005 at a party.
She told The Daily Herald of Everett she was excited and 
grateful to get it back. She gave the boys $25 rewards and the mother, Tracee Gorman, a $20 gift card for coffee.

UF educational psychology as-
sistant professor David Therriault 
was officially reinstated to his po-sition Monday after he received a layoff notice in July 2009.
In a hearing held June 28 at 
Emerson Alumni Hall, arbitrator Tom Young decided Therriault was unjustly laid off because uni-versity administration did not at-
tempt to find him an alternative 
position within the department of educational psychology or the College of Education and deemed 
him ineligible to apply for tenure.
Both are violations of the Col-
lective Bargaining Agreement.
“The university is supposed to 
make an active effort to find him another position, but instead they 
chose to ignore this part of the agreement,” said Candi Churchill, service unit director at the United 
Faculty of Florida. 
United Faculty of Florida, 
an organization that represents graduate employees and faculty throughout Florida universities, 
spoke on behalf of Therriault at the hearing.
The university cited adverse 
financial circumstances as the rea-son he was laid off.
Between 2008 and 2009, $100 
million was cut from UF’s bud-
get, said UF spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes. 
“There are thousands and 
thousands of faculty on this cam-
pus and the university was facing 
a severe budget deficit,” she said. “There’s no good way to make the cuts that we made, and unfortu-
nately there were some decisions Laid-off professor

GAS STATION WHERE SKIMMERS WERE DISCOVERED.

Liz woke up one morning to a voicemail 
on her phone.
The call was from her bank, USAA, notify-
ing her that her account had suspicious charg-
es on it and was flagged for fraud.
She checked her statements and discovered 
two fraudulent purchases, each for more than $100 at a gas station in Tampa.
But Liz hadn’t been in Tampa. She was 
asleep in her Gainesville residence when the charges were made.
Liz, who requested her last name not be 
used, is just one of the unknown number of Gainesville residents who had their credit card information saved onto a gas-pump skimmer and downloaded via Bluetooth by identity bandits. 
The 25-year-old said she frequently bought 
gas from the Kangaroo station at 3424 SW Wil-liston Road, where two skimmers were found on the weekend of July 24. 
Before the charges appeared, the last pur-
chase made with her card was gas from that station, she said. 
She responded by calling the bank and dis-
cussing the problem with USAA’s fraud de-partment. After about a week, she was able to Skimmer victims turn

More than 165,000 credit hours.
That’s about how many credits 
were taken by the undergraduate stu-
dents expected to attend their gradua-tions Saturday.
The recommended study time for 
that many credits would be 7.5 mil-lion hours, or 860 years, according to Martin Simpson, director of the Read-ing and Writing Center.
About 1,400 undergraduate stu-
dents plan to attend the graduation ceremony Saturday, according to Donna Stricker, director of the com-mencement. She said she’s unsure how many students will receive their degrees without attending the cer-
emony.
The number of students expected 
to attend the graduation was deter-
mined by the number of students who ordered caps and gowns.
The College of Liberal 
Arts and Sciences has the 
most students graduat-
ing, “by far,” Stricker 
said. The college expects about 268 
graduates.
In addition to the undergraduates, 
there will be more than 1,500 graduate 
and professional students graduating Saturday. Some professional schools, 2,900 grads to walk

ing” for short. Energy compa-
nies across rural America are attempting to lease property from residents in order to drill for natural gas. Filmmaker Josh Fox received a lucrative offer from an energy company want-ing to lease his property to tap into a reservoir of natural gas. 
Fox decided to take his camera 
and meet other rural residents on the front lines of fracking. He traveled to 32 states and dis-covered toxic streams, ruined aquifers, dying livestock, brutal illnesses and kitchen sinks that burst into flames. He learns that all water is connected, and 
perhaps some things are more 
valuable than money.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
� SG SPENDS $16,000 FOR OFFICIALS’ 
PHONE BILLS, MEAL CARDS ANNUALLY.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Senators voted against a bill that would 
limit funds given to Student Government of-
ficials for meals and cell phone bills during 
Tuesday’s meeting.
Members of the Student Alliance party 
authored the Student Government Fiscal Re-
sponsibility Act, that would have, if passed, put a cap on the money given to SG officials for cell phone usage and meal cards.
According to the bill, the Student Body 
president, vice president and treasurer each receive between $1,200 and $1,500 a year for 
cell phone usage and up to $3,000 for meal 
cards. All of this money comes from the SG budget.
This money, combined with money giv-
en to other SG officials, costs SG more than $16,000 per year. This number excludes sala-ries and travel costs, according to the bill.
In the bill, the Student Alliance party pro-
posed giving the officials only $65 a month 
for their cell phone bills, and $500 a year to-
ward their meal cards, which can be used at any Gator Dining location.
Jonathan Ossip, Senate leader for the Stu-
dent Alliance party, said he doesn’t want to see their compensations cut completely, nor 
is he against them receiving a salary, but he 
doesn’t think so much money for SG officials should be taken from the Student Body when the funds could be used for something else.
Putting a cap on these reimbursements is 
an obvious solution, Ossip said. 
“This could be going back to regular stu-
dents, and that’s what this bill is trying to 
do,” he said.
Ben Meyers, who repre-
sents the Unite Party, said the money is given to these officials because they can-not have a part-time job while serving in SG.
He said these members 
of SG spend most of their time in the Reitz Union, so 
they typically eat there, and they spend a lot of time on the phone working with people such as the SG lobbyists in Tallahassee. 
“These so-called perks are necessary 
to help them do their jobs,” Meyers said. “We’re lucky that we still even have leaders that are willing to serve.”Meals, phone bills spared

A UF employee and an electrical 
engineering student were arrested Wednesday for grand theft auto after they admitted to stealing two scooters.
At about 4 p.m., Gainesville Po-
lice officers spotted UF student Jared Wolffis, 24, and Bryan Urban, 22, suspi-ciously driving a truck around various apartment complexes off of Southwest 20th Avenue, according to the arrest reports.
When the officers followed the 
truck into Canopy Apartments, the pair stopped suddenly and made a U-turn 
in the parking lot, the report stated.
Police followed their truck until the 
officers pulled them over in Rockwood 
Villas Apartments, the report stated.
As police approached, Wolffis, who was in the passenger seat, got out of the 
truck and ran away, despite officers’ 
demands to stop, the report stated.
After being read his rights, Urban 
admitted to stealing the scooter in the bed of the truck from Canopy Apart-ments, the report stated.
A police dog, Justice, was brought 
to search for the student in the area around the apartment complex. Within 
minutes, Justice found Wolffis and bit him, ac-cording to a GPD state-ment.
The pair were also connected to the 
theft of another scooter from near 200 SE Second Ave., the report stated.
Wolffis is charged with grand theft 
auto, resisting arrest without violence, 
and loitering and prowling. Urban is 
charged with grand theft auto and loi-tering and prowling, the report stated.UF employee, student

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — With a startling 
report that some researchers call more 
spin than science, the government said Wednesday that the mess made by the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is most-ly gone already.
On the same day they trumpeted suc-
cess in plugging up the leaking well with drilling mud, federal officials announced that nearly 70 percent of the oil spilled dissolved naturally, or was burned, skimmed, dispersed or captured, with al-most nothing left to see — at least on top of the water.
The National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey announced in the five-page report that only 52.7 million gallons of oil are left in the Gulf. That is about 31 percent of the 172 million gallons that spewed into the water from the broken BP well.
Just because the oil is out of sight 
doesn’t mean the Gulf is out of harm’s way, federal scientists emphasized. And what’s left in the water is still almost five times the amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.
Nevertheless, Wednesday was a day 
of cautious celebration by a White House that has had little to cheer about from the oil spill.
“I think it is fairly safe to say ... that 
many of the doomsday scenarios that we talked about and repeated a lot have not and will not come to fruition,” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said at a briefing with NOAA’s top scientist.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 2010

Most taxis charge their customers, 
but there will soon be five new electric 
carts roaming the streets of downtown 
Gainesville looking to give people a free ride.
Next week, the first three electric carts 
will be arriving from the Gotcha Media 
Group, an Atlanta-based company started 
by two Florida State University alumni. 
The carts should be in service in just a 
couple weeks, according to company co-
founder Drew Sfugaras.
The carts seat five passengers, besides 
the employed driver who works for tips, and are 100 percent electrically run, Sfu-garas said.
The carts, specially designed with col-
lege students in mind, will be fitted with 
CD, DVD and MP3 players, as well as flat-
screen TVs, he said.
“If the Jetsons’ car had wheels, that’s 
kinda what they look like,” he said. “We 
want them to be fun.”
The drivers will also act as concierges, 
offering up-to-date information on local events and hot spots, he said.
The carts can run two to three hours on 
one charge, and use a rapid-charge system 
that fully energizes the battery in 30 min-
utes. 
The company is currently discussing with UF the best places to set up charging 
stations, Sfugaras said.
The carts can be hailed like paying tax-
is, or called in through a dispatch number. 
They will run from 7:30 a.m. until noon, he 
said. They will then start back up sometime in the evening and run until 3 a.m., so they will be 
available for students who have been out 
drinking, he said.
“The goal is that everyone gets home 
safely and we get everyone who needs a 
ride,” he said.
Gotcha, which stands for Green Oper-
ated Transit Carrying Humanity Around, can afford offering free rides because the carts will be “wrapped in advertisements,” he said.
The idea for the company came from 
trying to solve the pan-collegiate prob-
lem of difficult student parking while also 
giving advertisers the chance to make an impression on college students, Sfugaras said.
“It’s really the best way to get in front 
of these people,” he said. “We love the model of providing a free service to stu-dents while marketing.”
Other late-night transportation will 
still be available for students. ZipCarts, a 
nightly shuttle service, and a formerly free ride, now charges $3 per person and will compete with Gotcha taxis.
Student Government also offers Student 
Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol, the free cam-pus transportation service, until 3 a.m.FSU alumni bring version of ZipCarts to Gainesville

Professor plans to apply for tenurerecover her money. 
Bob Page, Alachua County president for 
Alarion Bank, said that under Federal Regula-
tion E, consumers who have been  victimized only need to pay up to $50. Of course, that de-pends on whether or not the bank deems the claim legitimate. 
The skimmers haven’t just been affecting 
consumers, but local businesses as well.
Patrick Daniel, co-owner of Go Video, a 
small video rental shop located inside the Chevron at 5221 NW 43rd St., said that he has been losing business because people are refus-ing to leave their credit card information with 
him. 
Go Video rents videos to customers by the 
day. To charge its customers, Go Video must keep credit card information on file in order 
to prevent people from absconding with its movies. 
To accommodate worried customers, Dan-
iel has had to take cash deposits on his rent-als. 
“I couldn’t explain to them that the skim-
mers, they get you at the pumps,” he said. 
Daniel also said that he 
has noticed a major increase 
in people who walk inside to pay.
Though she does not buy gas at the Chev-
ron where Go Video is located, Liz is included in the multitude of people who now pay in-side with cash.
“I’ve gotten yelled at [by my husband 
Dustin] for not paying inside,” she said. “If I just swipe at the gas pump, I get talked to.”

Therriault, however, had an almost $1 
million external grant from the National Sci-
ence Foundation.
Furthermore, a briefing filed by Churchill 
reads that the College of Education contin-ued to hire tenure-track faculty and post open positions after Therriault was laid off. 
“From my position, if this is a budgetary 
issue, the university should have a hiring freeze,” Churchill said. Therriault continued working during the 
past year.
“My responsibility is 
to my students and to my 
research and I take those 
things pretty seriously,” he 
said. “I am very happy with the results and to be able to get back to work and not be 
distracted by all this.”  
He plans to apply for 
tenure, and the university has already stated 
it will comply.GRAD , from page 1SKIMMERS , from page1

15% YES85% NOTuesday’s question: Would you want to hang with the “Jersey Shore” cast?Today’s question: Do you dare to be different?So long, summer
This long, hot and bor-
ing summer is finally 
coming to a close, 
and after all the dreadfully boring news that came out 
in the past few months, we 
think it should have come a 
lot sooner.
We had the BP oil spill, 
with scores of stories about “Top Kill” underwater cur-
rents bringing oil to Florida 
shores – if the topic was a 
horse, we’d shoot it. We 
had a new Supreme Court nominee, coupled with a 
confirmation process as 
predictable as the “Twi-light” plot. And who could 
forget the Lindsay Lohan 
trial? Nothing says “slow news season” like giving her hours of screen time on 
everything from TMZ to the 
evening news.
It could have been worse, 
though. We could have had a repeat of last summer’s 
painfully-overdrawn cov-
erage of Michael Jackson’s 
death. Although we can’t 
think of another pop star who could draw that much unwarranted attention. 
Maybe Madonna? Or Bono? 
Who cares, anyway?
We just hope none of 
these stories carry into the 
fall. It might be wishful 
thinking for the oil spill, but we could do without hear-
ing another word about 
Lindsay Lohan for the rest of 
our lives. What has she ever 
done except star in needless 
remakes of campy Disney 
films? Oh yeah, she helped cap off Michael Keaton’s 
career of classic ‘80s mov-
ies with an embarrassingly bad summer movie about a 
Volkswagen.
But now isn’t the time 
to focus on the past. Af-
ter summer exams we get 
a couple well-deserved 
weeks of relaxation before college football is back in 
full swing. At least by then 
there will be something a 
little more worthwhile on 
TV than what we’ve had to 
deal with for the past few 
months.Evil Event
Burn Quran Day 
deserves no attention
Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe hasn’t wasted any time 
coming out in protest of Dove World Outreach Cen-ter’s plans for a Quran burning on Sept. 11.
The event, “International Burn a Quran Day,” has gotten a 
lot of national press for its hate-mongering, anti-Islamic mes-
sage. We just would have used words a little stronger than 
“fringe” to categorize the group.
This group is an evil twist on the kind of high-cost, high-
commitment Christianity that  televangelists like Peter Popoff have been flooding the airwaves with for years, except in-stead of a $20 bottle of holy spring water and a prayer mat, adherents get brainwashed into having intense, unjustifiable hatred for their neighbors.
Sure, they have their right to freedom of speech, but we 
really can’t figure out how an event like this could possibly further their movement. Burning a Quran is something that anyone outside the fold of their cult would view as an act to incite a confrontation.
Unfortunately, people like this interpret any sort of atten-
tion – be it positive or negative – as affirmation that they are doing the right thing. That said, we are against protesting the group’s book burning since it would only push Dove World to turn up their zeal to 11 and plan more events like this in 
the future.
We don’t have any misconceptions that ignoring them 
will force them to stop, but we do have high hopes that a lack 
of attention will make them move to a place that feeds the fire – hopefully somewhere far away from Gainesville.
We have about 80 years to live, and about one-third of that we spend unconscious. And I don’t mean because of an accumulation of hard nights at Mid-
town. Throw in work, education, eating, daily household and personal hygiene chores, and the roughly five years ev-
eryone spends in a line of some sort just waiting for some-
thing like a red light to turn green.
Unlike Dorian Gray, we have no portrait of immortality, 
so why do we allow ourselves to live within our own “Tru-man” shows? Because our society glamorizes the standard.
I turn on the TV. Hmm. It’s HGTV. For the fourth time in 
two hours, “House Hunters” is on. It’s an entire show about normal people buying houses in a particularly unexciting way. Great. *Click*
MTV, “The Real World,” season – I don’t know – 241. 
So, 20 people in an unreasonably luxurious house are living there … I’m waiting for an actual plot … any reason to actu-ally continue watching this show …
*Click*Lindsay Lohan is in jail, again, and, for some reason, this 
dominates every news channel. And for some reason they want our opinions on the situation via Twitter.
*CLICK*
Sure, that’s just television. But what does society consider 
a fulfilled life? Well, you go to school to get a job, and then 
you get a job to pay for school.  Then you work until you can afford to not have to worry about anything, just like life was before school. It sounds cruel, but this is the necessary cycle of life in modern society.
Stay with me, I am certainly not advocating people quit 
their jobs and drop out of school. In fact, one of society’s ma-jor problems is that we allow people to simply throw their 
hands up and quit the cycle, and then we allow them to live 
off of everyone else for free in the form of government en-titlements. Instead, we as a society should be advocating in-dividual greatness.
Where is the cultivation of greatness and competition? When do we start to refocus on living life uniquely, independently and cre-atively? Why do we allow ourselves to conform to stereotypes so easily?
I’m a frat guy who doesn’t own a 
polo shirt. I like that. I’m a Republican who enjoys indie music and concerts. I like that, too. But I want more than to just break stereotypes. I want to make this one shot at life everything it is po-
tentially capable of being. And as much as I desire this, I also like to encourage this in others.
I don’t want the occasional dinner at Bennigan’s with 
friends who grow farther apart the older I get. I want Great 
Gatsby parties and dialogues worthy of the ancient Greeks 
and Romans.
I don’t want to live in the suburban house with hardwood 
floors and granite counter tops. I want to live in a castle with a secret bookcase and a conservatory.
I am not talking about being rich. I am talking about be-
ing different – not for the sake of being different but for the sake of the inherent fact that we are all different. Yet we allow each other to set our own standards of living and normalcy.  
That’s simply how I define my “greatness.” It is worth it 
to ask yourself what constitutes yours.
Don’t let life go by you without throwing in a jab. Some 
cannot appreciate serendipity; but it deserves more legitima-cy than it is currently given. 
Everyone I spoke to about this summer’s big blockbuster, 
“Inception,” loved it, especially because the concept of con-structing a unique world as one chooses is broadly appeal-ing. Well, why do we have to be dreaming to make the world 
our own?
On a note of encouragement, a simple message: It doesn’t 
have to be black and white; paint the roses whatever color 
you like.

    Freedom is an addictive thing, isn’t it? 
Each time we get a little bit more free-dom to do anything, regardless of the 
positive or negative impacts, we cling to it like a mother clinging to her newly born baby. It 
is our baby. It is our everything. But why is 
this so? Why do we ﬁ  nd it so difﬁ  cult to let go of any kind of freedom? I would put my hard-earned Monopoly money on the rea-son being a human tendency, to grasp onto anything that enables us to express ourselves. Since expression can be quasi-deﬁ  ned as life, the opportunity to live to one’s fullest poten-tial, which I believe is inﬁ  nite, can be equated 
as freedom.
  Normally when we speak about potential, 
we tend to be biased toward the positive pos-
sibilities. We have heard discussions of raw athletes reaching their true potential in quick-ness and strength through hard work and preparation. This doesn’t accurately portray potentiality because it could either be direct-ed toward the best or the worst. Potentiality 
refers to a future state. This can either be posi-
tive or negative depending on how you act in the present. And guess what, how you act in the present is always limited by the societal limits to your freedom.
  So why would society decide to limit your 
freedom? Is this ever justiﬁ  able? Or is it a ruse to dominate the masses? In some cases it is, and in some cases it is not. In fact, in UF’s case, as in many ad-vanced societies, there are both logical and moral reasons to limit an individual’s free-
dom. It makes logical 
sense, when living as a self-sustaining group 
of individuals that each person’s freedoms do not pose a justiﬁ  able threat to the goal of the society that is self-sustenance. Laws that punish for murder and theft have not only a moral basis but a logical push behind it. Since a majority of societies are formed to self-sus-tain and continue, it is reasonable for most 
societies to attempt to curb the apparently 
destructive potentialities of its citizens. Now, before dictators and oppressors rub their palms with glee, there is another dimension in this argument, and this involves the equal-ity of each individual in the society, not in rank or intelligence or wealth but in human dignity or humanity. It is ironic that societies with the best basis of self-sustenance are actu-
ally those that allow the most individual free-
doms tolerable to successful self-sustenance for obvious reasons such as greater expres-sion of its members, leading to more creativ-ity and risk taking.
  A moral argument for the justiﬁ  cation of 
curbing individuals’ freedoms in a society is that, since potentialities can be good or bad, and morally we would like what is in the best interest of ourselves for others, it is taken as a general norm that such leaders of societies take steps to curb the negative or bad free-doms, which are in the best interest of all. At the crux of this argument is the unity of 
individuals as human beings. In essence, the 
judgments of what are good or bad for you, which would normally be controversial, in this instance are not up for debate. If we can agree that what is harmful to you is bad, then society can make clear and decisive actions to curb your freedom.
  UF recently passed a smoking ban earlier 
this month prohibiting students from using 
tobacco products on its main campus. If my 
writing has been persuasive enough, you would take the logical and moral view that this is one step in the right direction for the institution. We all are aware of the dangers of smoking, not only to smokers, but to non-smokers who arguably have their own free-doms (to clean air) infringed upon. 
  The fact is, yes, your freedoms have been 
curbed, and yes, there are logical and moral reasons that could be made for it. It may be unenforceable, but it sends a positive mes-sage to its students. Freedom is a beautiful thing, but the craving to hang onto the deci-sions to ultimately do us harm is not only im-moral but silly. Let’s try not to be silly.

Speaking Out Competition should extend to 
other services as well
    In Tuesday’s Alligator, the 
Editorial Board took a strong 
stance in favor of adding more 
Gainesville utility providers, ﬁ  -
nally bringing the free market to our power and water and work-ing to stop the city-controlled 
socialists at GRU. Frankly, I 
couldn’t agree more.
  We should be asking members 
of the left-wing city commis-sion why they won’t let the free 
market work. They might say 
that adding another set of utili-ties would require tearing up the roads and building new power 
lines, or that the cost would be 
enormous, or that public utilities just don’t work that way. But I say they are dead wrong.
  This is America. No task is too 
bold, and their naysaying is in the way of private industry.
  While we’re tearing up the 
roads, why not build a second 
set of private, free market streets 
as well? The Florida Department of Transportation has held a mo-nopoly on our roads ever since I was born, and it’s high time we 
let competition prevail.
  The invisible hand of the free 
market needs to run its course, 
and creating competition for 
GRU is just the ﬁ  rst step. 
Personally, I think we need 
competition in the ﬁ  re depart-
ment, as well. With their com-munist, state-owned services, it 
makes perfect sense why their 
trucks are all painted red.

4LS Letter to the Editor
 Many wondered Barack 
Obama’s election could signal an end to racism. 
To some this could have been an overall sign of the end of rac-
ism, but surely anyone who is 
in touch with the outside world would ﬁ  nd this to be false during their daily routines.
      The fact of the matter is that 
racism exists in every culture and cannot be eradicated without uniﬁ  cation between them. There must be a willingness to practice empathy with everyone, includ-ing those with major differences.
  Understanding racism also 
requires an emotional under-standing to the feelings one feels 
through racial prejudice.
  Many feel racism and the be-
haviors that further racist mind-
sets are a cultural phenomenon. Oppression, neglect and a lack of expressed love, however, tran-scend cultures and race.
  The circumstances and make-
up of one’s surrounding through the crucial de-velopment years are where minds and hearts are led astray. 
The link between culture and 
racism comes from the belief that culture precedes racist mentali-ties. 
The fact that communities 
are not usually uniform in race or culture is one thing that con-trasts this. Also, the combination of neglected communities, low socioeconomic status and poor education contribute to the hard-ships that can breed racism.
  History provides us with 
evidence that oppressed people 
have often led to racism that pro-
gresses over time.  
  So as fall begins, embrace the 
diversity around you at school and be proud that you walk the hallways of one of the most di-verse campuses in America.

Dave’s final summer column: A whole season in review
And so, dear readers, here 
we are. Another summer in Gainesville has come and 
gone, and it’s time we all look back and reflect on how much we’ve gone through. There have been plenty of things to remember over this past 
pseudo-semester, like that time ... 
where ... um ...
OK, confession time. I really 
don’t remember much about this summer. 
I remember it getting so hot that 
my roommate melted and made a mess all over the rug, and then LeBron taking his talents to South 
Beach. 
Since then I’ve been listening 
to a loop of Eddie Murphy’s hit sin-
gle “Party All the Time” for weeks, while partying all the time. 
Unfortunately, it’s the afore -
mentioned partying that has ren-dered me completely unable to do a “Summer in Review” column without making most of this stuff up as I go.
I’ll start with something I’ve al-
ready mentioned. LeBron James, basketball player and monarch ex-traordinaire, will be playing for my 
hometown Miami Heat from now 
on. 
This is merely the next chap-
ter in the ongoing saga of Florida sports teams seal-clubbing the 
state of Ohio. 
Actually, now that I think about 
it, the people of Ohio are much like 
seals: blubbery, helpless and ter -
rible at sports.
Thanks to the ongoing events 
in the Gulf of Mexico, we have achieved our dream of being able to run our cars off seawater, like 
Elisabeth Shue said we could in 
that movie “The Saint” with Val Kilmer.S a d l y , 
Lindsay Lo -
han was sent 
to jail for the 
murder of Val Kilmer, after her law -
yers couldn’t prove that the movie 
“MacGruber” already murdered him, or that Val Kilmer is actually 
still alive.
Collectively, the world watched 
in horror as an alien race known as 
the “vuvuzela” descended on South 
Africa, and overtook the populace. 
The only thing that stopped 
them from taking over the world 
was their fascination with soccer. 
Obviously, the aliens do not 
have sports where they come from and were able to find soccer inter -
esting for a whole month. Luckily, a psychic octopus was 
able to drive them off.
“Toy Story 3” came out this sum-
mer, ending an 11 year wait  for those kids who watched the origi-nal two and were young enough to 
truly appreciate it. 
Unfortunately, Pixar realized all 
those kids grew up and decided 
to make them feel like total jerks about ever giving a toy away. 
Also, my roommate Paul was re -
duced to a blubbering mass by the end credits, sputtering “Andy loves Woody, but knows it’s time to let 
go!” 
He asked me not to mention 
that, but he’s late on the rent.
Gainesville and the rest of the 
East Coast had one of the hottest summers on record. 
I, and everyone else who bought 
Starcraft 2, didn’t notice.
Beyond that, literally nothing at 
all happened this summer. 
If anyone tries to tell you some -
thing that didn’t show up in this column, then they’re lying to you 
for the purposes of humor because 
he or she isn’t able to think of any -
thing else to come up with before 
deadline.
And so, readers, there it is. The 
whole summer, laid out for you in probably accurate fashion. 
I hope you know how much fun 
it has been entertaining you guys this summer, as I’m uncertain as 
to my future in this position, and 
whether it will be available for me when fall rolls around. 
To improve my chances, voice 
your support by saying nothing at all to the higher-ups at the Alligator (to the higher-ups: hope you guys are ready for the overwhelming si-lence). See you next fall, kids. 
Editor’s note: Dave Johnson is 
a great columnist but notoriously hard to reach.

Members of UF’s Greek com-
munity are responsible for the 
thousands of walking billboards for apartments, insurance companies and its own events  on campus and 
around Gainesville.
Liz Chrisco, 22, a UF architecture 
senior, was one of the mobile ad -
vertisements, trekking through the 
Plaza of the Americas with a pair 
of neon pink sunglasses displaying 
“GEICO” by her left ear. 
Chrisco is an 
example of an 
easy advertising 
trend this summer. Local businesses and organizations are taking advan-
tage of the sunny weather by hand -
ing out plastic, brightly colored sun-glasses with screen-printed logos for free to passersby.
Premier Corp., a local marketing 
firm, makes the plastic eye wear, as well as other promotional items available for custom screen-print-ing. 
Stacey Todd, Premier’s office 
manager since January 2009, said the popularity of sunglasses orders this year has significantly increased compared to last year, and she has 
seen a lot more people sporting the 
new shades.Greek organizations that have 
ordered sunglasses for its formals and socials, are responsible for the increase, she said.
Premier Corp. has done promo -
tions for Greek organizations like Kappa Delta, Sigma Kappa, Alpha 
Epsilon Pi, Alpha Chi Omega, Delta 
Tau Delta and the Jewish Student Union. 
They also have screen-printed 
sunglasses for apartment complex-es like Cottage Grove. 
UF’s Tau Epsilon Phi got its sun-
glasses printed with “TEP Formal ’10” from MRL Promotions, a pro -
motional advertising firm based in Fort Lauderdale. 
Lindsey Boyle, an employee of 
MRL since February, said that dur -
ing spring and the beginning of summer a lot of Greek organizations were seeking these sunglasses. 
Boyle attributes the fashion in-
dustry’s preference for neon colors 
as another reason for the trend’s 
success. 
“Our formal was on the beach 
and we had previously done beach 
towels as our giveaway, so we 
thought sunglasses were ideal,” said Justin Vines, who ordered the sunglasses from MRL for his frater -
nity, TEP.
Chrisco said she will continue to 
wear her sunglasses even though she knows she is advertising for free.
“I’m a broke college student.,” 
Chrisco said. “Why would I say no to free sunglasses?”THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 9

Nerd-core hip hop movement combines nerds and rap
By BRITTANY DAVIS  
avenue contributing writer
If Eminem and Luke Skywalker got into a 
shouting match over a rap beat, and they refer -
enced Halo, Harry Potter and hard drives, the re -
sult might sound like nerdcore. 
Simply put, nerdcore is rap music written by 
nerds and gamers for nerds and gamers, and 
according to Drew Love, who is organizing two Gainesville shows, the quirky and often goofy genre is picking up steam. 
In mid-July, about 700 people attended Ner -
dapalooza, an annual nerdcore music festival.Love, who works as a waiter and grew up play -
ing Pokemon and Street Fighter, is trying to help nerdcore gain momentum in Gainesville, where he says nerds are plentiful.
Rob Tobias, a UF computer sciences graduate 
who is friends with Love, said nerdcore is about being true to oneself.
“People would rather hear a nerd rap 
about being a nerd then someone who is not gangster trying to rap about being a 
gangster,” he said while sipping on a PBR.  
“There’s the traditional jocks versus geeks ste -
reotype, he said, but even some jocks are nerds 
deep down, whether they collect Magic The Gath-ering cards or baseball cards.”
“Everyone has got something they geek out 
over,” Tobias said.
Like traditional hip-hop, nerdcore has its 
share of controversy and feuds, most of which play out online.
Artists have publicly argued over women, and 
there were feuds over control of the music shar -
ing website, Rhyme Torrents.
Some nerdcore artists have made fun of tra-
ditional hip-hop in their songs, prompting accusa-tions that the genre is racist.
“I’m not going to say that none of it is insensi-
tive to racial barriers,” Tobias said. “But it’s more of a rookie mistake ... a poorly executed attempt 
to pay respect to something that’s not completely 
understood.”
At its base, nerdcore is about having fun, and 
the shows reflect that, Tobias said.
An Aug. 14 show will feature HDNinja, Magi-
Tek and Emergency Pizza Party. 
Krondor Krew, a group in which all the band 
members dress up like ninjas, and Epic-1 will perform Sep. 18. 
Both shows will be at The Laboratory and will 
offer a friendly introduction to nerdcore, Tobias said.

Editor’s note: Kat Bein followed a 
group of humans around this week -
end and wrote about her experienc -
es. 
It was 9 p.m. Friday night when 
I found myself at the Reitz Union 
Colonnade. UF was dark and most -
ly deserted, but I wasn’t alone.  
Inside the Reitz Union lobby, about 30 students stood huddled in groups, waiting anxiously for information 
from their leaders outside. 
Just beyond the colonnade steps 
waited the enemy, the scourge of the 
undead, the zombies.
It was a couple of days after the 
infection broke out, the third time in UF campus history, and already more than 40 people had changed. I was glad to be a human, and though 
I wasn’t armed, I was safe among 
these weathered warriors. Or at least, that’s what I hoped.
At about 9:15 p.m., the humans 
were called to muster. Dr. Muriel, the 
one woman who knew how to cook-
up a cure for the virus had been in-jured the night before and rescued by some brave young band of humans 
calling themselves the Basterds.
Dr. Muriel told everyone she need -
ed samples of the virus in order to 
recreate the cure in her lab, but the only samples she knew of were lost 
somewhere on campus, and we hu -
mans would need to scour the area 
for clues as to their whereabouts.
I was nervous. We were safe 
where we were, but the humans would all be leaving soon and I didn’t want to get left behind. I found the group with the most guns and fol -lowed them. I was a Basterd tonight.
Led by Nick LoCastro, a fourth-
year microbiology student, the Basterds are a tough looking band of badasses. LoCastro was armed with 
three guns. Another Basterd, Cam-
eron Conrad, was strapped to the nines with modified guns and a slew of sock-grenades draped across his chest.
The Basterds, about 10 in all that 
night, headed toward the Infirmary. We’d gotten a hint that some clues could be found “where sick students go.” LoCastro ordered us all to hush 
ourselves as we hustled through the 
shadows, guns cocked and ready in case of ambush.
We snuck around the back way 
and came through the Florida Gym. We met a game moderator, third-year computer engineering major T.J. Boyd, on the steps of the clinic, and he told us to look for something 
blue.
While the Basterds checked 
around, I stared at the body looming 
in front of us. I found out that was Derek Jones, the Original Zombie. I 
gulped.
Someone found the clue - it was 
a hazmat suit and mask and a clue 
reading something about having only 
two minutes to be somewhere. There 
wasn’t time to think what that meant because more zombies were rapidly gathering around. 
LoCastro ordered the Basterds to 
huddle, AKA I tried my best to get in the middle. The air was tense, and there was an uncomfortable calm before the storm as the zombies circled around us, then, suddenly-
AAHHHHHHHHH!!!! The zom-
bies roared and rushed our group. I screamed and put my hands on my ears as Nerf bullets shot past my 
head. I was confused. I thought I felt 
a zombie’s hand brush my face. But when the noise deadened and reality set in, I was still alive.
I was lucky. The zombies were 
only stunned for the next 10 min-utes. There was no time to grieve.
We took cover inside the Florida 
Gym before regrouping in McCarty 
Hall. One of the Basterds told me the 
chilling tale of how, last year, about 40 students were infected where we stood in a bloodbath referred to as the McCarty Feast. 
We met with Dr. Muriel. She told 
us it wasn’t looking good. Since we left the Reitz Union Colonnade about an hour and a half ago, the zombies 
had taken the lead and we Basterds, 
along with another group of maybe three or four somewhere else, were the only humans left.
On top of that, some humans had 
discovered the coolers hidden in Mc-Carty woods that contained the cure, but they had gone in before realizing the woods were “poisoned,” and 
technically they should have been 
dead for going in without the hazmat suits. 
The mission was pretty much a 
failure for the humans, and so plans 
were scrapped. The zombies were 
declared winners. But there was hope for tomorrow, and Dr. Muriel promised lots of cure cards to even 
the playing field the next morning.
Three times running and humans 
vs. zombies is still working out the 
kinks. But hey, it’s just a game.10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 2010

Hot Water Music frontman struggles to find balance  
By ALEX ORLANDO
avenue writer
He steps up to the microphone – 
eyes shut, sweat streaming down his 
face and guitar — as the raspy sound of his voice cuts through the twangy, bluegrass sound of his band. 
His thick, brownish-red beard al-
most touches the microphone as he sings and bangs out chords on his worn acoustic guitar, the pickguard long gone.
He may not look like it, but even now, as he entertains screams of 
“Chuck yeah!” from the audience 
between sets while casting a se -
rene look on the crowd — the kind you give your family after you’ve just finished Thanksgiving dinner – Chuck Ragan is fighting for balance.  
     That’s because he’s headed out on the road again, a road that offered him thousands of screaming fans when 
he started as the frontman for punk 
band Hot Water Music. It was also a road that he hated coming back from – back to the reality of eviction notices tacked to the doors of empty houses 
that he used to call home. 
Back to hauling his belongings 
from trash cans in the front yards of 
those houses. Back to donating blood to make rent payments.
That was the life Ragan had called 
normal until 2006, when the band went on an indefinite hiatus to deal with the  exhaustion, relationships and 
personal lives of its members after 
a run of touring between 1997 and 2005.
“You can only run a machine for so long before it needs maintenance,” he 
said.
Since then, aside from some tour -
ing and writing music independently, 
Ragan said he has been focusing on life in Gainesville.
He said he’s been spending time 
with his wife, fishing with friends on Orange Lake and around Shell Mound near Cedar Key and bringing back the 
fish to throw on the grill and sit in his 
lawn chair.
“You have to find a balance between 
doing what you love, making a living and running yourself into the dirt,” he said.  
Since the band reunited and re-vamped itself in 2008, Ragan said he’s gotten better about that balance between music and the rest of his life.  
He said he realized that last week when he was sitting on his porch in Gainesville, writing songs with the rest of the band, just like before his rigor -
ous and costly tour schedule.
But, he said, some things still

TEEING OFF WITH TOM GREEN UF BASKETBALL UF FOOTBALL FAN DAYBy ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
A new era is about to begin.
Former Gators quarterback Tim 
Tebow, who is in Denver participat-ing in practices as a member of the 
Denver Broncos, is gone. 
In steps redshirt junior John Brant-
ley – Florida’s new signal caller. 
“Well, you can’t replace (Tebow),” 
senior safety Ahmad Black said. “You 
only hope to keep up the tradition, and keep up what he’s done.”
But as UF begins its training camp 
today, Brantley will look to create his 
own legacy.
The Ocala native is more of a 
pocket passer than Tebow was, but 
will provide less with his legs. 
Last season, Brantley threw for 
410 yards and seven touchdowns to go along with zero interceptions in seven games, mostly in mop-up duty for Tebow. 
“We’re not going to run our quar-
terback as much,” center Mike Pounc-ey said. “He’s not as big as Superman 
was.”
However, UF coach Urban Mey-
er does not expect that dynamic to 
change the offensive scheme very much if there are other weapons that can spread the field.
“(Our offensive scheme) is not 
going to be dictated as much by the quarterback,” Meyer said. “I know 
what he can do. It’s the people around 
him.”
Even though the two primary of-
fensive targets from last season, wide receiver Riley Cooper and tight end Aaron Hernandez, are now in the NFL – the Gators expect even more playmakers to step up this year.
Wide receiver Deonte Thompson, 
who struggled at times and accumu-lated just 343 yards through the air last season, is expected to be the deep threat and the leader of this year’s re-ceiving core. 
But the players that could end up 
benefitting the most from Meyer’s de-cision to stick with the spread offense are speedy wide receivers Andre De-bose and Chris Rainey, who made the move to the position from running back in the offseason.
Debose, who Pouncey said would 
be the offensive player to emerge this year, came into UF last season as the  No. 2 wide receiver recruit, according to Rivals.com. But he never had the chance to play because of a hamstring injury. Debose has received compari-sons to Percy Harvin and could play the same role in this offense.
Other potential passing targets for Brantley are redshirt senior Carl Moore and redshirt sophomore Omarius Hines.
Brantley will be able to spread the 
ball around. But the biggest benefit 
he may have is the experience he has 
gained from watching Tebow handle the position for the last three sea-sons.
“John Brantley, he’s had a great 
run at Florida,” Pouncey said. “He’s been there three years, learning from one of the best quarterbacks that played the game. He’s ready to lead 
this team to a championship.”
Brantley begins new chapter
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF redshirt junior John Brantley (12) threw for seven touchdowns as a 
backup in 2009. He takes over for Tim Tebow at quarterback this year. 
The Gators open up their preseason training 
camp today, and that can only mean one thing around these parts: UF fans already have their 
eyes on a trip to Glendale, Ariz., in January.
But before they get their hopes up too much, I 
think now would be the best time to warn fans to curb their expectations for this year’s football team, because there are sure to be a few bumps in the road.
Now, I know many of you have been spoiled the 
last four years, with two Southeastern Conference titles, two BCS titles and a Heisman-winning quar-
terback who just so happened to be one of the great-
est – if not the greatest – college football players of all time.
But that was the past. Tim Tebow is gone, as are 
his two favorite receiving targets from last season in 
Riley Cooper and Aaron Hernandez.
Add in the losses of Joe Haden, who was arguably 
the best shutdown cornerback in the nation, lineback-
ers Brandon Spikes and Ryan Stamper, safety Major 
Wright and defensive ends 
Carlos Dunlap and Jermaine 
Cunningham, and it adds up to a lot of voids to fill from 
a team that went 13-1 and 
didn’t even win its confer-
ence championship.
Those losses leave many 
questions surrounding this team – questions that fans won’t find out the answer 
to until at least Sept. 11 against South Florida in the Gators’ only real test before they begin their SEC schedule.
The biggest questions remain on offense, where 
John Brantley will take over for Tebow. Brantley has been highly touted coming into the season, and by all accounts, he has the tools to be a great player by the time he leaves UF. But he has yet to prove anything as a starter.
More uncertainty revolves around the pieces sur-
rounding Brantley on offense. Who will emerge as the team’s go-to receivers? 
“We have a lot of talent,” coach Urban Meyer said 
at SEC Media Days last month. “I can’t list you the top six or seven playmakers in order. I know we have them.”
Meyer can’t list them in order because it’s clearly 
an unknown commodity. The potential is there for Brantley and the playmakers, but it’s just a matter of turning that potential into production during games.
The Gators also bring in the No. 2 recruiting class, 
according to Rivals.com, and some of those freshmen are sure to have positive impacts this season. But they 
won’t all pan out immediately – if at all.
So before you go booking a trip to Glendale in Jan-
uary, Gators fans, take off the orange-and-blue-tinted 
shades and look at this team for what it really is – tal-ented, but unproven.Gators fans should leave lofty expecta-tions at the door

Alabama finished last season atop the 
college football world, and that’s exactly 
where it begins this season, coming in as the unanimous No. 1 in the alligatorSports’ 
preseason college football poll.
But coach Nick Saban, who has won na-
tional championships at both LSU and Ala-
bama, knows that was last season and in or-der to get back to the top this year, his team 
will have to stay hungry and stay focused. And that will be no easy feat.
“You really can’t look in the rearview 
mirror and be able to accomplish these things,” Saban said at Southeastern Confer-
ence Media Days last month. “You have to 
look forward and stay focused on the pres-
ent moment in terms of what it takes to be 
successful.”
As if repeating as national champions in 
college football isn’t difficult enough – Ne-braska was the last school to win back-to-back titles in 1994 and 1995 (both Associ-
ated Press titles) – Alabama will have to 
replace a lot of components of last year’s 
title-winning team. The Tide lose 11 start-
ers combined on offense and defense, plus their kicker and punter.
Of the losses, Alabama’s defense takes 
the biggest hit, losing eight of 11 starters 
from last year. Out of those eight defensive players, six were drafted in April’s NFL Draft, including linebacker Rolando Mc-Clain (105 total tackles, four sacks, two in-
terceptions), cornerbacks Kareem Jackson (49 tackles, 13 passes broken up) and Javier 
Arenas (71 tackles, five interceptions, five sacks), and behemoth defensive tackle/gap-plugger Terrence Cody (28 tackles, six tackles for a loss).
Despite those losses, Alabama does re-
turn a starter at each level of the defense. 
In the secondary, defensive back Mark Bar-
ron returns to lead the defense. He led the team with seven interceptions – including one for a touchdown – and was second in tackles with 76.
At linebacker, Dont’a Hightower returns 
after an injury that kept him out of all but 
four games in 2009. Saban has said High-
tower could move around on defense and play multiple roles.
On the line, Alabama returns BCS title 
game MVP Marcell Dareus, who led the 
team with six and a half sacks last year. 
However, his status is up in the air, as he is the subject of an ongoing NCAA inves-
tigation.
While the defense is going through quite 
a makeover, the offense should look famil-
iar. The Tide return eight starters, including 
running back Mark Ingram, who rushed for 
1,658 yards and 17 touchdowns en route to becoming the first player in school history 
to win the Heisman.
Joining Ingram in the backfield is Trent 
Richardson, who rushed for 751 yards and 
eight scores as a freshman behind Ingram. 
The two will combine to form arguably the 
best one-two punch in college football.
Quarterback Greg McElroy, who hasn’t 
lost a game as a starter since the eighth grade and did an ample job of managing 
the offense in his first year as a starter for 
Alabama, also returns, as does his favorite 
target, wide receiver Julio Jones.
To make things even easier for those 
skill players on offense, three starters re-turn on the offensive line, so the offense 
shouldn’t lose a step. And if Saban can get 
the newcomers on defense to buy into his scheme, Alabama is a real threat to repeat 
as national champions.20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 2010

NEW YORK — Alex Rodriguez added 
his own memento to Monument Park, even 
though retirement remains years off.
After struggling to hit his 600th home run, 
A-Rod reached the milestone with his usual dramatic flair. He became the youngest player to attain the mighty mark and did it by driv-ing a pitch over Yankee Stadium’s center-field fence and into the area where the pinstriped greats are remembered. And remarkably, he did it exactly three years to the day after his 500th homer.“That’s amazing,” Rodriguez said. “To the 
day.”
His two-run, first-inning drive off Toron-
to’s Shaun Marcum put New York ahead, and 
the Yankees coasted to a 5-1 victory over the 
Blue Jays on a sweltering Wednesday after-noon. The win ended the Yankees’ three-game losing streak.
Rodriguez went 9 for 46 after homering on 
July 22, the longest stretch between Nos. 599 and 600 for any of the seven to reach the mark. He was hitless in his last 17 at-bats.
“It was a relief just to put it past me,” he said. “There’s no question I was pressing ‘cause I wanted to get it out of the way.”
A-Rod reached the 
milestone after a 12-game 
drought, connecting with a 
2-0 pitch over the middle of the plate for his 17th home run of the season.
Frankie Babilonia, a 
23-year-old in his second-year as a Yankee Stadium 
security guard, retrieved the ball and gave it to his supervisor, who had it passed on to Rodri-guez. Babilonia got to the ball because another security guard in the area was on break, and he was rewarded with an autographed A-Rod bat.
Babilonia said it was his job to turn in the 
ball, and he never thought about trying to keep it. In January, the ball a fan caught for A-Rod’s 500th homer was auctioned for $103,579.
Babilonia called the day “at the top” of his 
life experiences.
“Later on in the years, if I ever have chil-
dren, I’ll let them know I was the one who caught the 600th ball,” he said.
