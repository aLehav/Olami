Economics professor David Denslow, 69, poses for a picture in his ofﬁ  ce on Monday.

David Denslow, a professor in the 
Warrington College of Business Admin-
istration, will retire during the summer 
after more than 40 years at UF.  
Denslow has been teaching at UF since 
1969, he said. He plans to ofﬁ  cially retire 
on May 15.
He has taught introductory macroeco-
nomics for much of his UF career, and thousands of students have taken his class as a degree prerequisite. Recently, Denslow left that class to teach interna-
tional business.
He has received several awards while 
at the university, including Warrington’s 
teacher of the year four times.  
Denslow said he was glad to be a part 
of UF as it rose in rank over the years.
“I really enjoyed the fact that it got 
better and better over time,” he said.
Earning the President’s Medallion in 
Recognition of Distinguished Service in 1989 was especially meaningful, he said.
Biology junior Blake Tomlin, 21, took 
Denslow’s macroeconomics lecture his freshman year as a requirement for his business minor.
He said Denslow would present mul-
tiple topics in each lecture, jumping from one idea to another because they were all connected.Economics professor retiring

The UF School of Theatre and Dance has gone 
Gaga.
The school was recognized at a regional confer-
ence and chosen to perform at a national dance festi-
val using the Gaga dance technique in a dance called “Wired.”
Yaniv Abraham, an Israeli dancer, taught the tech-
nique to UF dancers over the summer. He also choreo-graphed the winning work during the Swamp Dance Festival 2011, a summer dance intensive program.
Gaga is a movement language from Israel that is 
relatively new to the U.S., said Joey Loto, a 20-year-
old dance sophomore and one of the nine dancers in 
“Wired.”
Loto said UF is one of the only universities to 
have a certiﬁ  ed Gaga instructor teach its students. 
The technique lets internal sensations guide dancers’ 
moves.
“The piece really improved the physical condi-
tions of dancers in the program,” he said.
Neta Pulvermacher, assistant dance professor and 
director of “Wired” and the Swamp Dance Festival, said 48 works were showcased in the southeast regional conference, which was held in Geor-
gia last week.
The American College Dance 
Festival Association holds the con-ferences every year and sponsors the National College Dance Festival 
every two years.
UF is one of the 30 schools participating this year 
at the national festival at John F. Kennedy Center for 
the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. from May 
24 to May 27.
The other schools chosen in the southeast were 
Florida State University and Kennesaw State Univer-
sity, Loto said.
Loto said this is the ﬁ  fth time UF has been invited 
to the national festival.
Dancers rehearsed every day for a month in sum-
mer. During the school year, they rehearsed about ﬁ  ve times a week for an hour, he said.Theatre and dance

A car ﬁ  re next to Southwest Recre-
ation Center and the Harn Museum 
left one man in jail and another with-out a ride.
Police said the ﬁ  re began inside 
the car around 8:45 p.m., shortly be-fore it pulled off of Southwest 34th Street onto Museum Road. Minutes later, it burst into ﬂ  ames.
“The car was fully engulfed,” said 
University Police Sgt. Michael Metz.
Police said Anthony Mizzell, 39, 
of Ocala, ﬂ  ed the scene of a minor ac-cident at the Kangaroo gas station on Southwest 34th Street and Southwest 35th Place minutes before the ﬁ  re be-gan. Somewhere between the gas sta-tion and Museum Road, a ﬁ  re started inside the Volkswagen.
Mizzell pulled off Southwest 34th 
Street onto Museum Road and got out of the car, leaving it in the middle of 
the road. His passenger, an unidenti-
ﬁ  ed male, got out seconds later.
The car began to roll downhill be-
fore resting against a gated area that housed a diesel tank.
Kasey Metzler, a 19-year-old event 
management sophomore, said she saw a small ﬁ  re in the backseat of the car while she was playing intramu-ral sand volleyball at Southwest Rec. She said after the car came to a stop, it erupted into ﬂ  ames.
She said she could hear the sounds 
of popping glass and screeching met-al while the car burned.
“It was crazy,” she said. “This 
doesn’t happen every day.”
Mizzell has been charged with 
leaving the scene of an accident with property damage for the hit-and-run.

A University of Pittsburgh study suggests that texting during class may interfere with a 
student’s ability to learn.
JULIA GLUM

When athletic training freshman Mor-
gan Villanueva loses interest in a lecture 
at UF, she reaches for her secret weapon: 
a cellphone.
Villanueva, 19, said she texts through-
out the 50-minute period.
She’s one of many college students 
who send text messages during class, but 
a recent University of Pittsburgh, Brad-ford study suggests the habit may im-pede their learning.
Math junior John Streese, 20, said if he 
already knows  what is being discussed, or he isn’t interested in the material, he will send up to 10 text messages per class.
“I feel like I’m listening less, but I don’t 
know if that relates to learning less,” he said.
Senior lecturer of communications Ed-
mund Kellerman said he doesn’t believe 
students are capable of multitasking. Those who text in his communication 
classes miss instructions.
“If you can’t pay attention to it, you 
cannot absorb it,” he said.
Kellerman tells his students to only 
use electronics to access the course web-site and for emergencies. 
He gives breaks during multi-period 
classes.
Kellerman said he has his own way 
of dealing with cellphones his students 
bring to class. 
“If your ringtone goes off, I get to sing 
along with it,” he said. “That’s a negative reinforcement. Trust me, you don’t want me to sing.”

Facebook expanded its net-
work and dominance over social 
media Monday by purchasing 
mobile photo-sharing app Insta-
gram for about $1 billion. Some UF students and faculty said the purchase made sense, though it 
raises questions about how the 
collaboration will work.
According to a Facebook news 
release, Instagram will continue to exist, despite the new owner -
ship.
“We’re committed to building 
and growing Instagram indepen-dently,” said Mark Zuckerberg, 
founder and CEO of Facebook, in 
the release.
Tory Polwin, a 22-year-old 
telecommunication and political science senior, said the partner -
ship could make the photo-shar -
ing process quicker and easier for people already sharing their Ins-tagram photos on Facebook.
“I definitely see the connection 
because Facebook is all about pic-
tures,” Polwin said. “That’s why 
a lot of people go on Facebook.”
UF journalism assistant pro-
fessor Amy Zerba said the part-
nership made sense but she was 
worried Facebook and Instagram are used by different audiences.
“It will be interesting because 
you do have those people who really want to break away from 
Facebook and have something a 
little bit different,” she said.
She said the cost of the buyout 
is Instagram’s individuality.“I kind of wish these great 
start-ups could make it on their own without being gobbled up by these big giants,” she said. “I 
just wonder what is next for Fa-
cebook.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 2012

A national organization will 
honor Innovation Square for its 
project to develop Gainesville’s economy.
The American Planning As-
sociation will present the Don-ald E. Hunter Excellence in Economic Development Plan-ning Award to the project on Monday at the 2012 National Planning Conference of the American Planning Association in Los Angeles.
“This is really the first time 
in Gainesville and across the county you have really true partnerships between campus and the city on this scale and with this amount of ambition,” said Kelly Fisher, director of the Gainesville Community Rede-velopment Agency.
The award is given each year 
to an idea that will significantly boost a local economy.
Innovation Square is a proj-
ect to create a 40-acre research and innovation center. 
The project’s centerpiece, 
Florida Innovation Hub at UF, located at 747 SW Second Ave., is already built and acts as an 
incubator for start-up busi-
nesses.
She said the award validates 
all the hard work the commu-nity has put into the project.
“Innovation Square will be 
successful because UF will be a great asset when it comes to educating students and provid-ing knowledge,” Fischer said.
She said Innovation Square 
will help grow the city’s retail economy and will help entre-preneurs who are starting out.
From the design view-
point, the award means a lot, 
said David Green, principal at 
Perkins+Will, the urban design and planning consultant for In-novation Square.
Linda Dixon, an assistant di-
rector at the Facilities, Planning and Construction division at UF, said the award recognizes 
the collaboration in the com-
munity.
“This is another way the 
university can put its name out there and get recognized for all of the good work it does,” she said.
Dixon said this project is 
a great way for students who 
want to be entrepreneurs to 
stay in Gainesville.
“This project lets you put 
down roots — not as a student, but as a resident — to start their careers and work life here,” she said.

Pulvermacher said she thinks the recognition is 
bringing more students to the school. She said the number of students has tripled since 2006, when she 
started working at UF. In the 2009-10 school year, 
281 students were enrolled in the school.
She said the dance program is the first at UF to 
have a study-abroad program in Israel.
“We have great dancers that people are really in-
terested in,” she said.

Organizers suggest bring-
ing a fire extinguisher to Pride 
Awareness Month’s annual drag show — it’s going to get hot.
The 12th annual drag show 
will be April 12 in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
Doors open at 7:30 p.m. 
and seating is first come, first served. 
The show is free and open to 
the public.
The theme of the show is 
“Gainesville is Burning: A Drag Show,” an homage to “Paris is Burning,” a documentary about the drag scene in New York City , said Anthony Licari, the show’s director.It will feature “RuPaul’s 
Drag Race” veterans Pandora 
Boxx, Sharon Needles and Ma-
nila Luzon. 
Drag kings Leona Chiar -
appa and Lauren Hannahs, known on the stage as Hunter de la Rose and Craven More, will also make appearances.
“The drag show bends the 
rules,” Licari said. “It makes 
people comfortable being them-
selves.”
Jessie Pincus, public rela-
tions director for Pride Aware-ness Month, said she expects about 500 people to attend. 
“The queens this year are 
class acts,” Licari said. “And we’re all college students — 
adults. Some profanity is ac-
cepted.”
VIP tickets are available 
through the event’s Facebook page. Tickets can be requested online and picked up at any Pride Awareness Month event before the show.Drag show expected

“I thought he was a very de-
tail-oriented teacher,” he said. 
“He wouldn’t dumb down mate-
rial for his students.”
Tomlin said Denslow was very 
approachable and quirky, invent-
ing terms like “trilemma” and 
pronouncing the same word mul-
tiple ways.
Denslow served as chairman 
of the Department of Economics, according to his resume. He was 
faculty adviser for Alpha Kappa 
Psi business fraternity for eight years.His research projects include 
work on historical Cuba, the housing bubble and aviation, he said.
He is a research economist for 
the university’s Bureau of Eco-nomic Business Research and director of its Policy Studies Pro-
gram.
Denslow has also been in-
volved in various state commit-
tees, according to his resume. He has examined legislative issues 
such as budget reform and urban 
growth.
He said he has a strong inter -
est in international business, and he taught and studied in Brazil for about five years. His master’s and doctorate degrees from Yale University are in economics.  
“You can cover anything you 
want in the whole world,” he said.
After he retires, Denslow plans 
to continue his research and in-volvement at UF. He would like to give seminars and work with students, particularly undergrad-uates.   
Denslow said he has enjoyed 
his years at UF.
“It’s been great,” he said. “I re-
ally lucked out.”PRoFeSS oR ,

The lion changing colors almost every 
week isn’t the only special thing about UF’s 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity house.
The SAE house, built in 1963 by Gene 
Leedy, has been recognized by the Florida chapter of the American Institute of Ar-chitects as one of the Top 100 buildings in 
Florida.
The No. 1 building will be the one with 
the most votes on the American Institute 
of Architects’ website. Results will be an-nounced later this month.
“It would be good positive recognition 
for us because it’s very public knowledge that we did come into some trouble with the university a couple years ago,” said SAE President Nathan Kenney, a 21-year-old food science and human nutrition ju-nior. “So this honor would help shine a positive light on our fraternity.”
SAE found out about the architecture 
honor when alumni shared the link through email and Facebook last month. Tyler Let-son, 20-year-old ﬁ  nance sophomore, said he found out when he received an email 
from the former president of SAE.
“SAE is the essence of our fraternity, 
providing a place to reside, eat and enjoy 
ourselves. It would be great to be recog-nized for all that it has given us,” Letson said.
Kenney said the fraternity is proud it can 
represent SAE chapters and UF and that it’s the only fraternity house on the list.
He cited many aspects of the three-story 
building that make it unique, including its large courtyard.
“It’s also structurally cool that there is 
no actual front door,” Kenney said. “There 
are multiple side entrances, but no true 
front door. You can basically reach any room from any side of the house because of this.”
Letson considers the SAE house to be 
more of a castle, noting it is best known for the lion that stands guard in front.
“We are truly blessed to have such an 
extraordinary building in which to work 
hard and play harder,” he said.TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Sexual orientation irrelevant in admissions
As we near the horizon of summer, many of us are in 
the job application process.
Employers are getting really nutty nowadays, 
and some even have the gall to ask for your Facebook pass-word — the combination to our personal social universe. Some of us can’t even bear the thought of our bosses creep-ing through past Spring Break albums.
But before we fret about the real world — the one with 
jobs that pay a “sustainable” salary — let’s reﬂ  ect on the seemingly tedious but realistically simple process of apply-ing to college.
Think back to when you were, say, 17-going-on-18 and 
completing college applications. After all the dreadful ﬁ  nan-cial paperwork and overhyped standardized testing came the mind-numbing part: the nitty-gritty details of race, eth-nicity and gender.
Then, imagine, as a teenager on the verge of adulthood, 
coming across a box to check for sexual orientation.
Sexual orientation? What a very personal, invasive reality 
check.
Some have their sexual orientation ﬁ  gured out by senior 
year. But for others it’s not so easy. Some might not have come to terms with it yet, others haven’t discovered it yet. Some are simply confused. After all, they’re only teenager — it’s just a fraction of years in the long span of life.
Elmhurst College in Illinois meant well when it ﬁ  rst 
popped the question on its application: Students who marked “yes” to being gay , lesbian, bisexual or transgender would be eligible for a diversity scholarship.
It’s sad to say that even in the “worldly” and “progres-
sive” atmospheres some universities claim to have, there’s still a small, swirling cloud of homophobia. Perhaps creat-ing a more diverse student body in terms of sexuality would make the college experience more inviting for questioning teens.
But as afﬁ  rmative action is already divisive, I say we 
spare those who have suffered enough harassment. It would be wise to leave the sexual orienta-tion factor at the door. Offering a scholarship would only be adding fuel to the ﬁ  re of homosexual re-sentment, and, in the case of mon-etary aid, jealousy.
The option could hypothetical-
ly open the door to liars and free-loaders. Anyone can cry “gay” or “lesbian” for a lighter tuition tab. 
It’s straight-up insulting to those who truly are homosexual and those who have had to overcome the associated difﬁ  cul-ties — not to mention it’s a shameless and cheap strategy.
What would happen to students who initially identify as 
heterosexual but then have a gay experience in college? Do they automatically qualify , or do they miss out on the golden opportunity? Before tackling such a touchy topic, the issues should be ironed out.
Considering another demographic for the sake of attrac-
tive statistics isn’t worth the potential fallout and controversy. In an honest effort to support the gay community, universi-ties might just be weighing it down.
In the ongoing — and increasingly successful — ﬁ  ght 
for equality , I think homosexual students would prefer to be treated the same in the admissions process. Being gay shouldn’t make them any more or any less a qualiﬁ  ed stu-dent. By no means should it be looked upon as a handicap.
Colleges (and the workforce) should try to keep the ques-
tions to the bare minimum. Irrelevant factors include, but are not limited to: race, gender, income, parental education and sexual orientation. Relevant factors are GPA, test scores and resumes.
Best of luck in the rat race of ﬁ  nding a job this summer, 
and may access to your Facebook be the most invasive ques-tion you’ll ever be faced with answering.

How to effectively 
contact the governor
On Monday, former Sen. Bob Graham encouraged stu-
dents at Florida universities to speak out and make their voices heard to the state legislature and gover-
nor.
Speciﬁ  cally, Graham has encouraged students to contact 
the governor to get him to veto budget cuts to higher educa-tion in the state, which currently total $300 million.
Whether you agree or disagree with Graham about the 
danger of cuts to higher education, his call to become active 
and involved with the policy-making process should be ap-
plauded.
Students, especially when it comes to the budget for high-
er education, tuition and new fees, are the most affected by 
these changes.
It is no secret that, compared to voter turnout among older 
Americans, young people just are not that active in politics.
According to exit polls compiled by the Pew Research 
Center, voter turnout in Florida among voters 18 to 29 years old decreased from 17 percent of the total electorate in 2004 to 
14 percent of the total electorate in 2008.
In heeding the former senator’s call to action, we wanted 
to provide a few tips to students wishing to speak out in fa-vor of or against policies dealing with higher education in the 
state of Florida.
First, students must know their audience.In this case, you will likely be writing to Gov. Rick Scott. 
The governor does not write legislation, and he certainly does 
not vote on legislation, so be sure to encourage Gov. Scott to 
sign or veto the current budget.
Second, make sure your letter is original. While some seem 
to think that ﬂ  ooding a politician’s ofﬁ  ce with thousands of 
copies of the same letter might be effective, we encourage you 
to focus on quality, not quantity.
Also, tell the governor who you are, and be sure to men-
tion that you are a student at a Florida university.
Third, keep your letter as short and simple as possible. You 
are not writing a treatise or a manifesto.
Fourth, be speciﬁ  c.
Not only should you know to whom you are writing, but 
you should also know what bill your letter references. That means you should know the number of the bill and the title. 
Again, you should also be speciﬁ  c about the action you want 
to be taken, i.e. signed or vetoed.
Finally, and most importantly, be courteous.If you do not like Gov. Scott, do not call him names or say 
he is evil. Instead, be reasonable and rational in your argu-
ments. Explain why you believe it is vital that the governor 
act in a certain way.
Sign your letter graciously, thanking the governor for tak-
ing the time to read your letter.
You can email the governor at www.ﬂ  gov.com/contact-
gov-scott/email-the-governor/.

Letter to the Editor
Yesterday, President Obama returned from a three-day trip 
to Seoul in which he met with leaders from South Korea, China and Russia to discuss nuclear security and prolifera-
tion.
Now, in any discussion regarding this matter, there are a num-
ber of topics that will inevitably be raised, including how to draw down the nuclear arsenals of the Cold War powers, how to ensure that nuclear weapons don’t fall into the hands of terrorists and what to do about North Korea. All three are extremely pressing 
issues, but the latter clearly overshadows the other two.
North Korea is one of three states that possess nuclear weap-
ons that are not members of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons (the other two being India and Pakistan), as it demonstrated to the world in October 2006 when it conducted an underground nuclear weapons test. 
But having a nuclear weapon doesn’t give you much bargaining 
power unless you have a way of deploying it via a missile, which is exactly what the North Koreans have been working on building for the past several years.
This, of course, is a very bad thing. A North Korea capable of firing a rocket with nuclear warheads 
strapped to it is a benefit to no one. The U.S. has tried several times to halt North Korea’s nuclear development program, only to have 
Kim Jong Il, when he was still alive, back 
out in an attempt to milk more concessions 
out of the American government.
In the latest attempt to squelch North 
Korea’s nuclear ambitions, Washington 
brokered a deal with Pyongyang at the end of last month under 
which it agreed to allow international inspectors to monitor its nu-
clear facilities and to suspend its plans to launch a rocket in return 
for some 240,000 metric tons of food. Predictably enough, North Korea is now saying it’s going to carry out the rocket launch any-way, and it is going to do it in about two or three weeks’ time.
The rocket is supposed to carry a satellite into orbit, though 
attempts in 2006 and 2009 to do the same resulted in the rocket blowing up seconds after liftoff the first time and the second time plunging into the ocean. In any event, if this next launch is success-fully carried out, everyone loses.
The biggest losers might just be — as they have almost always 
been — the civilian population of North Korea. They desperately need the food aid that Washington has promised them, and they’re not going to get it if their government once again goes back on its promise. North Korea is perhaps the worst place to live on Earth, with nearly everyone slowly dying of starvation and suffering from malnourishment. For this reason, North Koreans are about three or four inches shorter than their fellow peninsula-dwellers to the south. Some two million North Koreans are estimated to have died in the 1990s because of widespread famine and natural disas-ters.
North Korea has done nothing but disservices to its own people 
and to the world at large. President Bush was unable to prevent it from developing nuclear technology, which it subsequently shared with another equally unstable regime in Syria. More so than any of his myriad of other failures, that may prove to be the most cata-strophic.
Sean Talia is a columnist for The Heights at Boston College.Alligator should apologize to Zot Szurgot
As a co-worker, student and friend of Zot 
Lynn Szurgot, I am confident that the allega-
tions described in the Friday issue of the Al-
ligator are false.
Zot is one of the most compassionate hu-
man beings that I have ever met and has dem-
onstrated her commitment to workers’ rights, 
social justice and sustainability time and time 
again. Many residents of this community owe Zot a debt of gratitude for her efforts, but all of us owe her the benefit of a fair trial before a jury of her peers.
I was extremely disappointed that the 
editorial staff of the Alligator disregarded the most basic tenets of our criminal justice sys-
tem, as well as journalistic standards, when 
you decided to summarily convict Zot of these allegations in your “Darts & Laurels” edito-rial.
The crimes that Zot has been accused of 
come with potentially harsh, lifelong conse-quences if she is convicted. Before you con-demn someone to such a fate in the public eye, you should be damn sure that they are guilty.There is not a single one of us who hasn’t at 
some point in our lives been accused of some-thing that we were innocent of, and we owe each other the same basic decency that we’d 
expect and that has been outlined in our crimi-
nal justice system from its origins.
Further, I noted that both your editorial 
and the news story made use of Zot’s status as 
a transgender person. This status has no more 
relevance than Zot’s age or race, and I am con-cerned that you were playing into trans-pho-bic sentiments in our community and grossly misinformed stereotypes of our transgender neighbors.
While I doubt that you were intentionally 
trying to harm the transgender community through your statements, words can be pow-
erful weapons and I encourage you to be more 
circumspect in your use of them in the future.
I hope that you will retract your unfortu-
nate statements immediately and will apolo-
gize personally to both Zot and to the commu-
nity at large for your journalistic shortcomings in this instance.

Failure to halt North 
Korea’s nuclear program could prove catastrophicUWire
What good have you done today?
On the day I’m writing this, I’ve done lit-
tle.
I ate breakfast, drank a cup of coffee and have done 
nothing (save for type this column) to contribute to the 
life of another.
But what could I do? Certainly there are things I 
could do, but which of them would be valuable, and 
which would prove an utter waste of energy?
Our impact on the world, as a whole, is limited. De-
spite our ability to contact the other end of the Earth, few of us do, and few of us have done this to success-fully manifest any social, political or economic change.
No matter how many Kony T-shirts you buy , you’re 
not going to bring the man to justice alone by “making him famous.” No matter how many hoodies you wear, you alone won’t change Florida’s legislation on self-defense (to say nothing of destructing the stereotype people have about a man in a hood).
Each of these movements requires a complex of as-
sociations and a combined mass of individual support.
That is not to say that we have no influence on the 
structure of the world around us. Individuals now have 
more outlets to catalyze change than ever before (when 
public hearsay — and subsequent execution — was the surest way to get your name known). Now a single YouTube video or blog post is enough to spark a move-ment. Yet the conditions must be so ripe, the message so simple and the audience so impressionable that few of the many calls ever rally support.
There’s at least one way , however, for us to have 
a definitive, positive impact on the world outside our 
burp bubble.
You walk by the sign nearly every day.
“Save Three Lives!”“Give Blood Today!”“You Give Blood, We Give [Free S--t!”]From the lack of traffic I 
see in the blood bus (there are always more stations empty than occupied), I take it few people actually donate (save 
for fundraisers and events 
when an incentive encour -
ages your good deeds).
But we likely all know 
someone, whether or not 
we’re aware of it, who has required a blood transfu-sion.
Some facts to keep in mind:According to the American Red Cross, every two 
seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood.
That’s more than 38,000 blood donations needed ev-
ery day.
A single car accident victim can require as many as 
100 pints of blood (each donation is about three pints worth).
Do you know anyone who has sickle-cell disease 
or who went through chemotherapy? They probably needed frequent blood transfusions.
Spending less than an hour every two months, losing 
three pints of blood and getting free s--t (boxers, T-shirts, cookies, etc.), can actively help save someone’s life — someone who may one day be a loved one or yourself.
Yes, the procedure may be uncomfortable for some. But I know, as you know, that you stick and pour 
more corrosive s--t into your body than the tip of a sani-tized hypodermic does.
If you can sit through the discomfort of an over -
crowded bus ride, a morning-after hangover or the fab-ricated story of someone you despise, you can surely sit through an hour’s blood donation.

opinions@alligator.org� THE CRUISE WILL RETRACE 
THE TITANIC’S VOYAGE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LONDON — A memorial cruise 
retracing the route of the Titanic 100 
years since it sank has been slightly delayed because of high winds, a 
spokeswoman for the cruise said 
Monday.
The Titanic Memorial Cruise ar -
rived at the town of Cobh, on Ire-land’s southern coast, about two 
hours later than scheduled due to 
the bad weather, Rachel O’Reilly said.
The vessel, called the MS Bal-
moral, set sail from Southampton in southern England Sunday for the 12-night cruise.
Cobh, once known as Queen-
stown, was the Titanic’s last port of call before it set out across the At-lantic in April 1912. As the Balmoral pulled into the town’s port Monday, it was welcomed by thousands of cheering well-wishers.
The ship, which carries 1,309 
passengers — including relatives of some of the more than 1,500 Titanic passengers who died — will leave Cobh around midnight for the North Atlantic site where the ship hit an iceberg and sank, O’Reilly said.
The cruise seeks to recreate the 
experience onboard the Titanic — minus the disaster. Many pas-sengers are dressed in period cos-tumes for the journey , as are crew members and stewards. Passengers will also eat meals from the Titanic’s menu while a live band plays music of the era.
Two special memorial services 
will take place over the weekend: The first close to midnight Apr. 14, when the Titanic hit the iceberg, and the second on early Apr. 15, when the ship sank.
The Balmoral is operated by Fred. 
Olsen Cruise Lines, whose parent company, Harland and Wolff, built the Titanic in Belfast.
The memorial cruise is among an 
abundance of commemorations and memorials to the reputedly unsink-able ship that have sprung up to co-incide with the 100th anniversary of the Titanic’s doomed voyage.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 2012

As the semester comes to an end, an inconve-
nient reality kicks in: moving day.
But Campus Bellhops, a new UF student-run 
moving company , will try to help ease the stress of 
moving.
Ty Parker, a 22-year-old mechanical engineer -
ing senior and co-director of the company , said he heard about the success of Campus Bellhops at Au-burn University in the fall and wanted to bring the business to UF this spring.
Campus Bellhops will help any student who 
needs to move in the Gainesville area. The cost of moving without furniture is $100, and moving with furniture is $150.
“The purpose is to help people move in and 
out,” Parker said. “It will mostly benefit parents who cannot travel to help their kids.”
Alex Mahoney, a 23-year-old UF graduate stu-
dent and co-director, said the company will benefit UF in two ways.
“It provides jobs for students in need and pro-
vides services for students who are not interested in moving,” he said.Campus Bellhops hires only students. Appli-
cants are required to provide a photo and a para-
graph about themselves, Mahoney said. That way, 
students who sign up for the service can see who will help them move.
Parker said once students sign up for a moving 
time, it’s up to the student employees to pick what date and time they want to work.
Movers work in pairs, and Campus Bellhops has 
hired about 78 employees so far.
McKenzie McNabb, a 21-year-old public rela-
tions junior, said she likes the idea of students  help-
ing other students move. McNabb’s family will be 
helping her younger brother move when he goes to college in August, and they won’t be able to help her move out during the same time.
“I haven’t heard of anything like this before,” 
she said. “Typically when you move, you have to hire strangers who you cannot trust. With students, I feel more trusting.”New student-run moving

Handcuffed inside a police car, a Gainesville man kicked 
through a back seat window Easter morning.
Moments earlier, Billy W. Weaver yanked his arms every 
which way as Gainesville Police officer Steven Carter escorted 
him to the car. Hitting a police officer was no big deal, Weaver 
said, according to an arrest report.
Weaver, 38, was booked on charges of burglary , resisting an 
officer and two counts of criminal mischief. He caused about 
$800 in damage, police said.
Weaver broke into Southern Scooters and ATVs, located at 4306 NW 13th St., at about 4:40 a.m. Sunday, police said. He 
hopped a fence behind the store, climbed a barrel and pried off the metal frame of a back window to get inside. Then he pulled open the roll-up door in the back, police said.
When the door opened, an alarm went 
off.
By the time officers arrived, Weaver was 
gone. Carter and the store’s manager, David Willis, watched a surveillance video that showed Weaver walking through the shop 
looking at saws and scooters.
While the officers stayed at the store, Willis walked about a block south to grab coffee at a Sunoco gas station convenience store. Inside, Willis saw a man who looked just like the one in 
the surveillance video. The man was wearing the same clothes, 
police said.
Officers drove to the store, but Weaver said he wasn’t leav-
ing. Carter grabbed him and pulled him toward the police car. Weaver tried to break free, so Carter pressed him against the hood of the police car and handcuffed him, according to the report.
Inside the car, Weaver rolled on his back and kicked through 
the window. He continued kicking, so three officers held him 
down while one of them strapped his arms and legs together. 
On the way to jail, police said, Weaver broke the straps off twice.
Weaver was held at the Alachua County Jail on a $25,000 
bond Monday.

Some Gainesville residents are 
concerned about drivers whizzing 
through their neighborhoods. They are calling for more speed bumps, but the city says that’s not an option.
The City Commission stopped 
speed bump installation in 2004, but put in radar speed limit signs and roundabouts to slow down drivers.
The city prohibited the speed 
bumps because it slowed down am-bulances and fire trucks on their way to emergencies, said City Traffic Op-erations Manager Phil Mann.
One speed bump can slow a fire 
truck down as much as 30 seconds in a situation where every second counts, said Gainesville Fire Rescue Deputy Chief Tim Hayes.
“We’ve got to get to the emer -
gency in four minutes,” Hayes said. “That additional time is pretty dev-astating to us.”
Though no action was taken 
Monday during a city Recreation, 
Cultural Affairs and Public Works 
Committee meeting to discuss the issue, Commissioner Todd Chase asked Mann if he would look into the costs of installing more speed limit 
radar signs in the requested areas around the city.
G a i n e s v i l l e 
resident Michael Holt lives near Northwest 22nd Street, which has only a radar sign to keep drivers’ 
speed in check. Holt, who has three children, said that’s not enough.
“I’m glad it’s there,” Holt said, 
“But the radar sign doesn’t deter people from speeding.”

Powell’s injury
How big of a blow is Ronald 
Powell’s injury to UF’s defense? Check out The Rally, page 14. Softball player wins award
Gators third baseman Sami Fagan won the 
SEC’s Freshman of the Week award Monday. She hit her first homer against FSU last week.BRYAN HOLT
Alligator Writer
For the first time this season, Florida 
isn’t considered the best team in col-
lege baseball. 
When Monday’s rankings came out, 
the Gators plummeted from No. 1 to No. 7, an unsurprising landing for a team that has lost five of its last seven 
games. 
“We’ll talk about it,” coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said when asked if the drop 
can motivate his team out of a midsea-son lull. “If it does help, that’d be great, 
but we’ll see.”
The Gators will waste no time in 
trying to prove that they still belong 
atop the rankings. Tonight at 6, Florida 
State, the nation’s new No. 1 team, will be waiting at Dick Howser Stadium in 
Tallahassee. The Gators (25-7) will try to sweep a season series against the Seminoles (27-5) for the first time since 
1958. 
While that is the big picture of Tues-
day night’s game, at its core is a once 
dominant Florida team searching for 
answers. Through three weekends of Southeastern Conference play, 
the Gators have already lost as many 
conference series as they did all of last 
season. 
During its past seven games, Flori-
da has had its starting pitcher go more 
than four innings only twice. Even Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff
Junior Ronald Powell (7) is pushed by right tackle Chaz Green during Saturday’s spring game. Powell fell 
to the turf after being pushed and suffered a torn ACL in his left knee. He is out at least four months.
� THE JUNIOR WAS HURT 
DURING SATURDAY’S SPRING GAME.
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
When Ronald Powell left the 
field with a knee injury in Saturday’s 
spring game, coach Will Muschamp hardly seemed worried. 
In his postgame press confer -
ence, Muschamp devoted just a sen-tence to Powell, speculating that the junior Buck linebacker had simply sprained his left knee. 
But Monday’s MRI revealed 
that Powell has a torn ACL that is expected to sideline him for at least four to six months, according to a UF release. 
That would put Powell on pace 
for a return sometime between Au-gust and October, with UF’s season kicking off against Bowling Green on Sept. 1.
“Ronald is in good spirits and is 
very eager to do whatever is neces-sary to have a healthy, speedy re-covery ,” Muschamp said Monday 
morning. “He has already started 
with prehab and once the swell-
ing goes down and he regains his 
range of motion, he will have the 
surgery.”
Although UF’s release specu-
lated that there would be a four- to six-month recovery time, six months is usually considered the bare minimum for an ACL injury , with most athletes waiting seven to nine months to lessen the risk of reinjury . Additionally , those recovery times are typically measured from sur -
gery, which Muschamp stated Pow-ell has not yet had. 
Powell started 12 games last year 
and led UF with six sacks. He also posted 32 tackles, including nine for a loss. 
Considered something of a dis-
appointment after coming to UF as Rivals’ No. 1 overall recruit in the class of 2010, Powell was reportedly 
making strides 
this spring. 
On his Twit-
ter account, Pow-ell posted: “cant nothin Stop me but me Ive over come so much in life y stop now grind dnt stop 
when you do, I WILL be the reason 
the word grind live on!” 
Assistant leaves UF: Men’s bas-
ketball assistant coach Norm Rob-
erts is leaving Florida to accept a position at Kansas, UF announced Monday. 
Roberts came to UF last April af-
ter coach Billy Donovan’s previous three assistants — Larry Shyatt, Rob 
Lanier and Richard Pitino — all left 
the program for other jobs. Powell out four to six months with torn ACL; Roberts to KU

Gators looking for first season 
sweep of Seminoles since ‘58
Florida’s fall from the top of the col-
lege baseball polls was a swift one — one that surely has people ques-
tioning if this team is as good as it was advertised to be entering the season.
After holding steady with the No. 1 
ranking in the nation for more than two 
months, the Gators dropped to seventh 
in the latest Baseball America Top 25 on Monday following five losses in their last seven games and consecutive weekend series losses for the first time since 2008.
But Florida’s stumble in the polls and 
recent struggles on the diamond shouldn’t be cause for too much concern; these mid-season lapses happen.
Since Baseball America’s Top 25 poll 
debuted 31 years ago, no team has gone wire to wire with the No. 1 ranking. 
So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that 
Florida — even as heavily favored as it 
was coming into the season — couldn’t pull off that feat, 
either.
So pump the 
brakes before rush-ing to the conclu-sion that this team isn’t what it was 
hyped up to be, be-
cause it still can be the best in the nation, 
regardless of what the 5-6 record over the last 11 games may indicate.
This is still the same team that won a 
school-record 18 straight games immedi-ately before this rocky period. 
It just so happens the Gators aren’t 
playing their best baseball in the meat of 
the nation’s toughest schedule, one that 
continues against No. 1 Florida State to-night.
The defense has let Florida down re-Florida’s rankings drop, rough 
patch not cause for concern

“People who do things the wrong way need to stop hating on the ones who 
do it the right way. What makes you think you have the right?... Smh”

Report: Meyer gave preferential treatment, lost control of program
Returning to Kansas, where Roberts served as associate 
head coach in 2003-04, allows him to reunite with Bill Self, who 
Roberts has worked under at four different schools. Roberts’ son, Niko, is also a preferred walk-on at KU. 
“Norm Roberts did a great job on our staff the past year here at Florida,” Donovan said. “I have a lot of respect for the Kan-
sas program and Bill Self, and I know this is a great opportunity for Norm and his family to all be together.”
Meyer’s legacy at UF takes beating:
A Sporting News report released Monday details how former coach Urban Meyer allegedly lost control of the UF program.The report claims that Meyer gave preferential treatment to 
elite players in his “Circle of Trust,” most notably Percy Har-vin. The report also details Florida’s issues with drugs and how Meyer covered up failed tests. 
The story goes on to cite sources who say that Meyer has 
already committed recruiting violations while at Ohio State. 
 Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator.org. NOTEBOOK , from page 13THE RALLY
JOHN: All of the offseason signals pointed 
to the belief that Ronald Powell was ﬁ  nally 
becoming the elite playmaker on defense 
he was recruited to be.
After two inconsistent years at Florida, 
Powell — who was once the No. 1 overall re-cruit in the country — garnered steady praise from coach Will Muschamp throughout spring practice for his improvement at the Buck line-backer position.
The upcoming season was supposed to be 
a breakout year for not only Powell but also the rest of the Gators’ defense. 
Not anymore. 
Those plans and predictions have been put 
on hold for at least four to six months after it 
was announced Monday that Powell will re-quire surgery after suffering a torn ACL in Saturday’s spring game. 
For as long as Powell remains out, there’s 
no way Florida’s defense can grow into a dominant Southeastern Conference unit with-out its leader in sacks.
Don’t be surprised if that means another 
season of watching a number of opposing quarterbacks walk out of The Swamp with clean jerseys and a win under their belts.
MATT: The sky is falling! The sky is fall-
ing! Oh, no, Super Powie is out!
C’mon, Boothe, really? The Gators defense 
ﬁ  nished eighth nationally a season ago in spite of Powell, not because of him. And it will be 
better this year without him. 
Believe the hearsay out of Team Mus-
champ’s mouths all you want, but the Pow-
ell I saw Saturday was the same one who got pushed around all last year, and the same one who was never going to materialize into 
the feared edge 
rusher everyone anointed him as before he had played a mean-ingful snap. 
Even on the play in which he was injured, 
Powell showed his — ahem — softer side. All it took was a gentle shove from Chaz Green to 
send the “heralded” Buck linebacker ﬂ  ailing 
to an awkward landing on the sideline. 
He was never going to be the answer at 
Muschamp’s coveted spot, regardless of how many times the New Ball Coach says he has done “some nice things.” In fact, Florida al-ready has his replacement on the roster, and that guy’s name is Lerentee McCray. 
JOHN: So in his ﬁ  fth year of eligibility Mc-
Cray is going to be the awe-inspiring answer to UF missing its best pass-rushing option? 
While I’m not going to deride the abilities 
of a fellow Ocala native, McCray — who is a much better ﬁ  t as the Sam linebacker — has been plagued with his own chronic injury issues that have tempered his production. McCray missed four games last sea-son with a shoulder injury that lin-
gered into the offseason, causing Mus-
champ to hold him from spring practice.Meanwhile, in both scrimmages this spring, Powell was named the defensive player of the day.
I realize those 
awards may seem trivial in your eyes, but there is no rea-
son Muschamp 
would throw that kind of praise on Powell just to help his conﬁ  dence or stroke a damaged 
ego. Powell was clearly making progress be-fore the injury and whichever linebacker UF tries to plug in behind him is only set up to 
fail at arguably the most demanding position 
in the Gators’ defense.
MATT: “Best pass-rushing option” is a 
relative term. 
Powell may have been Florida’s best option 
a season ago, but replacing a guy that picked up at least four of his six sacks thanks to excel-lent coverage on the back end will not be all that difﬁ  cult. McCray racked up 7.5 tackles for 
loss in 2011, which ranked fourth on the team 
despite playing in at least three fewer games. He also tied for the team-high in quarterback hurries even though he played signiﬁ  cantly fewer snaps than Powell or other comparable options. 
But McCray will not be alone in supple-
menting the loss of Powell. While I have cau-tioned many times about relying on freshmen 
to produce in their ﬁ  rst season, especially at a 
spot like defensive end or “the Buck,” Mus-champ had the vision to foresee an issue like this one. And that’s why he heavily recruited on the line this past offseason. 
Dante Fowler, Bryan Cox, Alex McCalister 
and Jonathan Bullard can all provide help up front in the wake of Powell’s loss, even if that wake is more similar to that of a kayak than a 
cruise ship. 
JOHN: While those freshmen might have 
the physical attributes to make an impact in 
the future, the complexity of the Powell’s hy-brid position is suited for only one linebacker on the roster this spring. 
And that player is Powell.Though he was a sophomore last season, 
he was still playing in his ﬁ  rst college season 
in a 3-4 defense at an altogether different po-
sition that needed him to be both an effective blitzing end and coverage linebacker.
It takes a freak athlete like Powell to have 
any chance of becoming successful at the po-sition and I don’t see any other Gators player with the ability to ﬁ  nd it this season.
MATT: First of all, Florida doesn’t play a 
3-4. The base defense is a 4-3, meaning Pow-
ell is responsible for playing with his hand on 
the ground on the majority of defensive snaps, like every other defensive end in the country . 
Save all this technical mumbo jumbo. Pow-
ell never ﬁ  gured it out. He wasn’t the guy. And if you can’t ﬁ  gure out that the Gators don’t play a 3-4, then I’m not sure you’ll ever realize that Powell just isn’t the player you’re making him out to be. 
Florida will be just ﬁ  ne this season. Vote for the winner at alligatorSports.org.Contact John Boothe at jboothe@alligator.org

Sophomore Alaina Johnson has been clutch during UF’s late-season 
dominance, notching a 9.95 on vault Saturday at NCAA Regionals.
  LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Writer
 
  At the Southeastern Conference 
Championships on March 24, the 
Gators exploded on vault with a 
49.525 to rally to the top of the lea-derboard.
  Two weeks later, they took it up 
a notch.
  No. 1 seed Florida had the 
NCAA Southeastern Regional practically wrapped up after three events Saturday but saved its best 
for last on vault. The team recorded 
a 49.55 — its second-highest vault total of the year — to increase its 
lead against the ﬁ  eld to 1.1 points. 
  The performance on vault gave 
UF a 197.325 total for the afternoon, the best team score of all six region-
al competitions. 
  “On vault, we did one of our 
best, from top to bottom, per-formances of the season,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “All in all, I 
was very pleased.”
  In its ﬁ  rst six meets of the sea-
son, UF averaged a 49.20 on vault. But in its past six competitions, it 
has averaged a 49.45. 
  Before regionals, Florida was 
ranked fourth in the country with a regional qualifying score of 49.39 on vault, behind UCLA, Alabama and Nebraska. But on Saturday, the Gators outscored all of these teams 
on UF’s third-best event.
  Beginning on vault was fresh-
man Rachel Spicer, who has been 
solid in the leadoff spot all season. 
She scored a 9.825 to start the rota-
tion on a positive note.
  With senior Nicole Ellis out of 
the vault lineup with a hip injury, Faehn had to choose between two freshmen — Kiersten Wang and 
Jamie Shisler — to ﬁ  ll in Ellis’ No. 
2 role. The day of regionals, Faehn decided to go with Wang. 
  “She trained really well all 
week,” Faehn said. “We felt really calm and conﬁ  dent with her.”
  Wang, who had not competed 
on vault since Jan. 20, notched a season-best 9.875 after nearly stick-
ing her landing. Her performance 
proved to be a key motivator for UF’s four all-arounders.
  “Kiersten really did a great job,” Faehn said. “She really stepped it up. She’s always had the potential to do a great vault.”
  Junior Ashanée Dickerson and 
sophomore Alaina Johnson then tallied season-best scores of 9.95 af-
ter sticking their landings. Round-
ing out the rotation was junior Marissa King (9.875) and freshman 
Kytra Hunter (9.9). 
  “We came up with quite a few 
of the stuck landings, which was helpful,” Faehn said.
  Once the meet ended, UF found 
all six of its vaulters in the top 20. Dickerson and Johnson shared ﬁ  rst 
place, while Hunter tied for fourth with two other gymnasts. 
  When No. 1 seed Florida com-
petes at the evening session of the NCAA Championships on April 20 
in The Arena at Gwinnett Center in 
Duluth, Ga., its ﬁ  rst rotation will be vault. The Gators, who started on 
vault at all ﬁ  ve of their home meets 
this season, hope to use that as an advantage.  
  “Beginning of the season, our 
goal was to win SECs. We did that. Our goal was to win regionals. We 
did that,” Faehn said. “If we get 
everyone hitting on all cylinders at once, it should be pretty much just 
ﬁ  reworks.”
  Vault performances prove key for UF
“Beginning of the season, 
our goal was to win SECs. We 
did that. Our goal was to win 
regionals. We did that. ”

UF gymnastics coach
UF Fo otballFlorida is 30 games below .500 all-time against FSU in Tallahassee  
worse, the Gators have allowed an 
average of seven runs per game in their past five losses, after entering 
the Ole Miss series allowing 2.7 runs 
per game. 
“The ultimate goal for us is just to 
stay positive and learn from our mis-
takes, which there are a lot to learn 
from,” freshman first baseman Taylor Gushue said. 
Despite entering the stretch as 
one of the top-10 teams in the nation 
in fielding percentage, the Gators 
have committed nine errors in seven games, and none of them have come from Vickash Ramjit or Daniel Pigott 
— the two outfielders whom Florida 
was concerned about after losing se-nior center fielder Tyler Thompson to injury. 
In fact, Ramjit has been one of the 
few consistent players for UF during the slide. 
As strange as it sounds, a meet-
ing with the nation’s new top team might be a chance for Florida to pull things together. In their previous two games with the Seminoles this season, the Gators have won handily behind dominant pitching. 
But the two meetings have been 
a rarity for FSU, a team that has lost just three games to teams not named Florida this year. 
Factor in that the Gators are 30 
games below .500 all-time in Talla-
hassee, and you have a one-night sto-
ryline 54 years in the making.
Perpetually at a loss for words the 
past couple weeks, O’Sullivan was 
simple when asked what he hopes to 
see out of his team Tuesday.

ing team. Simple as that. I don’t care what the score is, just score more runs 
than the opposing team.”baseball , from page 13TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

A shot sails past the baseline. A back-
hand slams into the net. A second serve 
lands just out for a double fault.
In tennis, there are always misfortunes 
that befall players. No. 2 Florida has been able to minimize those misfortunes en route to a 17-1 record, but the season hasn’t 
been devoid of mistakes. 
However, coach Roland Thornqvist has 
repeatedly praised his players for a qual-
ity that often gets overlooked — body lan-guage. After almost every match in the last month, he has praised his team for “profes-sional body language,” which he said ulti-
mately boils down to controlling emotions.
“If you looked at our team this weekend 
when we played, even in those two sets 
that were close, I think our players looked in control,” he said. “Maybe we didn’t feel totally in control inside, but we looked in control, and I think that’s really impor -
tant.”
Perhaps the best example was sopho-
more Olivia Janowicz, who played the only match on Sunday that was not a total blowout. Facing LSU’s Ariel Morton, Jano-wicz struggled through the first set, which she won 7-5. She committed numerous unforced errors but never lost her compo-sure. 
Like Thornqvist said, she may not have 
felt in control of the match. As far as Mor -
ton was concerned, though, Janowicz had no concern. She went on to win the second set 6-3.
Thornqvist said that at this point in 
the season, when the schedule shifts from 
regular season dual matches to postseason 
showdowns, composure and body lan-guage become increasingly important. 
In the coming weeks, Florida faces the 
prospect of facing Georgia, the last team to give the Gators any semblance of a challenge, in the Southeastern Conference Tournament. Beyond that, every opponent will be a challenge.
“When we play high-intensity matches 
and close sets, we have to be able to handle mistakes, handle the ups and downs,” he 
said. “You save energy , you look professional, you look unbeatable. Per -
haps in the easy matches it’s not important, but the tough matches, the 4-3’s, 
those are the ones where the little details make a difference.”
The key , Thornqvist 
said, is not overreacting. While shows of emotion, such as Allie Will’s periodic cries of “What!” are not discouraged, Florida’s coach said that being able to remain level-headed on the court is a sign of maturity . 
That maturity, he said, is the biggest dif-
ference between last year’s team and this one. 
With as talented a roster as he has, 
Thornqvist has had to drive home the point that even the smallest detail can be the dif-ference between a win and a loss.With postseason approaching, UF looking for every advantage
cently, with the team committing as many errors dur -
ing this 11-game stretch (13), as it did during the first 21 
games of the season, when it started 20-1.
The starting rotation, which was the team’s strength 
heading into the year, has been in flux lately due to inju-ries, and the bullpen hasn’t been as sharp. The timely hit-ting Florida prides itself on just hasn’t been there, either, 
with the team average dropping from .309 to .292 during 
the 11-game rough patch.
Simply put, Florida is in a rut. But with All-America bats and MLB prospects littered 
throughout the lineup, and Kevin O’Sullivan — who 
vowed to focus on pitching and defense when he accept-
ed the job — running the show, the Gators’ ship will be righted.
“We got a good team,” O’Sullivan said following Sat-
urday’s loss to LSU. “We’ll be there in the end; we just 
gotta play a little bit better.”
O’Sullivan is right. The Gators will be vying for a na-
tional title in Omaha, Neb., even if they aren’t playing like 
it right now. 
He has done enough during his tenure to prove that Florida will be fine come May and June. 
As baseball types love to say: This is a game of failure. 
Stretches like this happen, and as O’Sullivan said Sat-
urday, maybe being bumped from the top spot in the 
polls is just what the Gators need to help them get back on track. 
It’s a lengthy season, and the road to the College World 
Series is a long, grueling one. 
But this rough stretch will prove to be just a speed 
bump on that road.
So don’t jump off that bandwagon just yet.

In Alyssa Bache’s first season with the Gators, her time in 
the circle has been limited.
Slotted behind sophomore Hannah Rogers and fellow 
freshman Lauren Haeger in the pitching rotation, Bache’s 
33.2 innings mark only 13.7 percent of No. 6 Florida’s total 
frames.
However, the freshman hurler has been effective, posting 
a 0.83 ERA and a 1.04 WHIP in 11 appearances.
Coach Tim Walton has seen enough from Bache to believe 
she has improved enough during the course of the season to 
shoulder a greater workload for UF moving forward.
The Gators will need Bache to log more innings during 
the final four weeks of the season as Florida faces the likes of No. 2 Alabama, No. 24 LSU and Auburn.
“Yeah, in spots. … I’m very happy with her to this point 
in the season,” Walton said about how he plans to use Bache against ranked competition. 
If Bache throws like she did in UF’s 14-3 win against Ole 
Miss on April 8, the Gators should do just fine with their No. 3 starter down the stretch.Bache retired the first nine Rebels she faced Sunday and 
pitched four perfect frames in her five-inning outing, strik-ing out a career-high five batters.
The only blemish for Bache was the fourth inning, when 
she yielded three earned runs on three hits and a walk. 
“The second time through the lineup is a lot different for 
her,” Walton said. “The only inning they had a good inning on (there) was a walk to lead off the inning. Had a perfect game going on at that point.”
Bache pitched all five innings in the run-rule victory Sun-
day for her third complete game of the season. After endur -
ing a rocky second trip through the lineup, Bache kept the ball in the infield, fanning two batters and inducing a popup 
in the final frame.
“It felt amazing, especially coming out of the fourth in-
ning,” Bache said. “Being able to have two strikeouts (in the 
final inning) and go right out there, it felt good.”While an effective performance against a sub-.500 squad 
like Ole Miss does not speak volumes, Bache’s outings ear -
lier in the season against No. 4 Washington and No. 10 Ten-nessee were solid.
Bache pitched a combined 5.1 scoreless innings against 
the Huskies and the Volunteers, surrendering just seven hits, walking three batters and notching five strikeouts.
“She did a great job against Tennessee,” Walton said. 
“Again, one time through the lineup. Second time through the lineup, they kinda caught on to her a little bit. You know, she’s a freshman and she’ll get better as we go through (the season).”
Bache is one of several freshmen who have stepped up 
for the Gators in recent games.
Bailey Castro hit three home runs in the weekend sweep 
of Ole Miss, and Sami Fagan earned Southeastern Confer -
ence Freshman of the Week honors after hitting a three-run homer in a 9-1 defeat of No. 21 Florida State on April 4.
“We’re feeling really good, especially with the upper -
classmen — with the few that we have — and even the soph-omores are helping us out a lot,” Bache said. “Everybody’s doing good. I mean everybody’s just doing good.”

�UF HAS FALLEN BEHIND AGAINST 
TOP COMPETITION THIS SEASON.

The Gators are looking for consistency.
They have found it in spurts but want it 
for all 60 minutes each and every match.
Florida improved its record against top-
20 opponents to 5-2 with a 13-12 overtime win against Johns Hopkins on Saturday. But in all but one of those games, the Gators 
have either fallen behind by at least two 
goals in the first 10 minutes or had at least a 15-minute scoring drought at some point in the contest.
With matchups against American La-
crosse Conference rivals No. 17 Vanderbilt and top-ranked Northwestern remaining on the schedule, coach Amanda O’Leary said her team cannot afford to dig itself any 
holes.
“I don’t think it’s something we want to 
get ourselves into,” O’Leary said of falling 
behind by two goals. “Because the next two games, I’m not so sure we’re going to be 
able to pull ourselves out of those deficits.” 
Junior attacker Gabi Wiegand, the team’s 
leading scorer, said the Gators can’t let fall-
ing behind take them out of their offensive 
gameplan.
“A lot of it has to do with patience and 
making sure we aren’t rushing things,” 
Wiegand said. “It’s pretty common that when teams get down they get in a panic 
mode. We need to take our time and work 
for the shot that’s going to be 100 percent.”
Johns Hopkins jumped out to a 3-1 lead 
on Saturday and also went on a 6-1 run 
in the second half to take an 11-10 lead. O’Leary said the defenders need to im-
prove on executing their double teams to 
prevent such runs.
“Ultimately, we have to do a much bet-
ter job when they’re coming at us hard 1v1, 
slowing the ball down and 
making sure we have that 
first and second slide,” 
O’Leary said.
Freshman defender 
Sally Jentis, who replaced 
junior Emily Dohony after she suffered a head injury midway through the sec-
ond half against Johns Hopkins, caused a game-changing turnover to give the Gators 
the winning possession in the second over -
time. But she was also in for the Blue Jays’ 
6-1 run and said the defense needed to do a better job of covering the open player af-
ter a double team, noting that the opposi-tion often likes to send players on backdoor 
cuts.
“We should have realized when they 
were going to drive and when they were trying to draw the double,” Jentis said.
Johns Hopkins attacker Taylor D’Amore 
continuously drove on the Gators’ defense 
and was able to dish the ball to another 
open attacker because of the attention she drew, finishing with a game-high five as-sists. Jentis said it is on the defense to shift 
away from only the attacker farthest from 
the net in those situations and not leave anyone open. 
She also said it is important for the de-
fense to not be to hard on themselves when 
the opposition finds the back of the net.
“Once they score a bunch, you just kind 
of get down,” Jentis said. “A lot of it is 
when they do score to keep yourself up and 
not let it happen again.”Gators lacrosse coach O’Leary growing weary of slow starts
