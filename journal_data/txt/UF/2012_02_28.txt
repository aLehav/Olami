Last March, Molly Ammon 
never made it home from her 
ﬁ  rst college Spring Break. 
The 19-year-old died from 
alcohol poisoning while vaca-tioning with friends in Pinel-
las County.
This year, her family and 
friends are using Facebook to 
educate students about how 
to prevent a similar tragedy.
About 1,000 people have 
“liked” Molly Ammon Spring Break Awareness, a page that 
encourages students to be 
careful while partying.
The medical reporter for 
Tampa Bay’s Fox 13 news, Dr. 
Joette Giovinco, created the 
page after interviewing Mol-ly’s mom, Angie Ammon.“I think the important 
thing is to get the message out to kids [of] what to do when they’re with a friend who has had too much to drink,” Am-mon said.
The Delta Delta Delta soror-
ity sister had been stumbling after a day and night of drink-ing at the beach, so her friends laid her in bed to “sleep it off,” according to the page.
They checked on her, but 
in the morning, she wasn’t breathing. Toxicology reports recorded her blood-alcohol content at 0.40, according to the Fox story.
“If you’re too afraid to 
call a parent or you’re not in a place where you can, don’t put them to bed,” Ammon said. “Keep them awake.”

  Administrators discussed cre-
ating a way for students to anony-
mously report hazing incidents to 
authorities Monday.
  UF’s anti-hazing task force met 
to consider the idea, as well as the idea of posting the history of proven hazing cases on the dean of students’ website.
  Bernard Mair, associate pro-
vost of undergraduate affairs, said anonymous reporting would be 
useful because it would help stu-
dents feel more comfortable with reporting hazing incidents.
  “It’s not well-reported because 
victims fear retribution,” he said.
  Chris Loschiavo, assistant dean 
of students and director of student conduct and conﬂ  ict resolution, said the system might not ﬁ  t well 
with procedures outlined in the 
Student Honor Code and Student 
Conduct Code.
  “It will tie our hands in terms 
of being able to follow through for student conduct,” he said. “We 
won’t have anyone that the ac-cused can confront, and our pro-
cess currently provides for that right.”
  He said the code could possibly 
be revised to include a provision 
that would allow for anonymous 
witnesses.
  The task force also discussed 
creating a page on the dean of students’ website with the history 
of proven hazing cases for all stu-dent organizations.
  Loschiavo said the list would include valid hazing charges, sanctions against the organiza-tion and the group’s status as a result of the hazing, as well as the 
group’s current status.
  The information would be 
placed online permanently, re-
gardless of the group’s current status.

Residents can have a say about who gov-
erns their city by casting ballots in today’s 
city runoff elections.
The polls will be open today from 7 a.m. 
to 7 p.m.
City commissioners decide on rules that 
affect how the city runs — everything from how late bars are allowed to stay open to how much residents’ Gainesville Regional Utilities bills will be.
Lauren Poe and Nathan Skop received the 
most votes for the city’s at-large 1 seat on the commission in the Jan. 31 regular elections. Neither received a majority, which led the race to a runoff.
Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter 
said 12,213 people voted in the January at-large election. Poe received the most votes with 4,411, and Skop followed with 2,955 votes.
“These are the people who are determining the direction of your community,” Carpenter 
said. “If you want to have a say in that direction, you have to go out and vote.”
Skop, a lawyer and 
former commissioner on the Florida Public Service 
Commission, has built his 
campaign around the need 
for ﬁ  scal responsibility, a more open government 
and increased public safety.Poe, an associate professor at Santa Fe 
College and former city commissioner, has focused his campaign on furthering innova-tion, bringing more businesses to Gainesville and creating more public centers throughout neighborhoods.
Voters should bring a valid photo I.D. with 
a signature. Gator 1 Cards will be accepted.
See a map of voting locations on and near 
campus on page 3.

UF students and staff gave one 
last encore to late professor Paul 
Favini at a Monday afternoon me-
morial service.
The interim director of the UF 
School of Theatre and Dance and 
associate professor of costume 
design died a month ago after bat-
tling cancer for nearly three years, according to a Feb. 1 Alligator ar -ticle.
Favini, 51, had been a faculty 
member since 2000.
Former theater and linguistics 
student Kristen Perry, 22, gradu-ated in May 2011. Favini mentored 
her in costume design classes.
“He always brought such a fun-
loving energy to our classroom 
and really knew how to lighten 
the mood, yet at the same time 
kept everyone focused,” she said.Favini was involved in about 60 
theatrical productions, according to his resume. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2009, said School of Theatre and Dance professor Kevin Marshall.
Almost all of the 420 seats at 
the Constans Theatre were filled for the ceremony.  
Speakers ranged from Favini’s 
students and co-workers to his partner, John Reger.
They shared stories of Favini’s 
idiosyncrasies, from his insistence on colorful neckties and making 
his own curtains to his love of can-
dy corn and Cole Porter songs.
English and theater senior 
Monica Gomez, 22, said she wish-
es she had gotten to know Favini 
better.
“I never had him as a teacher 
but he still knew my name — that’s what gets me,” she said.  
Toward the end of the ceremo-
ny, Reger accepted a medallion on Favini’s behalf for his 12 years of service to the university.
Reger has partnered with UF to 
set up the Paul F. Favini Memorial 
Fund to benefit students and pro-
grams in the School of Theatreand Dance.
Musical theater senior Katrina 
Asmar, 24, sang “They Were You” from “The Fantasticks.” It was Favini’s favorite musical, said speaker Evans Haile.  
“He was always behind me no 
matter how little of him I saw,” said Asmar. “I always felt like he was somebody who was backing me and believed in me from the 
beginning.”� THE CAUSE OF HER 
DEATH IS UNKNOWN.

A year-long search for a 
missing Gainesville woman 
ended Monday when her re-
mains were identified.
Human skeletal remains 
found in the woods off New-
berry Road last week were 
identified as those of Juliann 
Spates, said Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Sgt. Todd Kelly.
Detectives identified 
Spates by a partial handprint from the remains, he said.
Spates, who would be 
53 years old, was reported 
missing by her daughter in 
January 2011. Spates was last 
seen in November 2010.
The remains were found the night of Feb. 21 by a homeless couple who were looking for a place to sleep, according to Alligator ar -
chives. They ran to a nearby 
McDonald’s and called 911.
As of Monday, Kelly said 
the cause of Spates’ death 
was unknown.
He said some members 
of Spates’ family were at 
the scene where her remains were the same day they were 
discovered. 
He didn’t know how her 
family members had been 
notified, although he said they knew Spates often went 
to that area of the woods.
Anyone who has informa-
tion about this incident is en-
couraged to contact the Ala-chua County Sheriff’s Office 
at 352-955-1818.

Clammy skin, irregular 
breathing signs to seek help
es from people all over saying 
they’ve read the page and shared it with their kids.
“The parent that you call might 
be really ticked off, but trust me, I would rather be a ticked off par -
ent than a heartbroken mother,” Ammon said.
UF’s Tri-Delta chapter sup-
ports the page, said chapter Pres-ident Laura Jane Powell.
“It’s really important for us to 
remember her going into Spring Break and remember the impact that she has on our chapter every single day,” she said. “It’s been so close to our hearts for the past year, and it will be for the rest of our lives.”
The Facebook page is just one 
way of getting the word out about staying safe while drinking, said Maureen Miller, GatorWell’s co-ordinator for alcohol and other drug prevention.
Signs of alcohol poisoning can 
include clammy or bluish skin, vomiting while passed out and an irregular breathing rate, she said.
“If someone is so passed out 
or unresponsive that you try to wake them up and you can’t, that’s really a big indication that you need to get them help right away,” Miller said.
This list of signs is not compre-hensive, she said, and students should not make assumptions 
based on how an intoxicated per -
son has handled the level of alco-hol before.
The people Molly was with 
made a mistake, Ammon said.
That’s why the page is so im-
portant to her.
“If it saves one child and one 
family the heartache we’ve been 
though, I’m completely, com-
pletely in favor of it,” she said.

� THE 52-YEAR-OLD GAINESVILLE MAN DID 
NOT WANT HIS SON AND GRANDDAUGHTER WATCHING HIS TV, POLICE SAID.
TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
During a fight about his TV Sunday morning, a 
Gainesville man reached between his couch cushions 
and pulled out a revolver.
“I’m going to kill you,” Willie A. Williams said, ac-
cording to an arrest report.
Williams, 52, of 1915 NE 17th Drive, was arrested 
and charged with aggravated battery and aggravated assault. He was still at the Alachua County Jail in lieu of 
a $9,000 bond Monday afternoon.
He started arguing with his son around 11 a.m. Sat-
urday, according to police. Williams didn’t want his son 
and his 10-month-old granddaughter watching his TV 
on his day off.
Williams stood over his son and yelled. He pointed a finger in his son’s face and warned him not be disre-
spectful in his own house, police said.
When the son, whose name and age were not re-
leased, told Williams to back off, Williams cocked his walking cane. He was ready to strike, but his son pushed him into the TV .
Williams tried to strike again, but his son ripped the 
cane away. Wrestling ensued, and Williams found him-
self pinned to the couch. That’s when he pulled out the .22 Magnum. It was loaded with four rounds, police said.
Williams smacked the gun against 
the side of his son’s head. His son eventually pulled the gun away and 
ran outside to call police. Williams 
also violated a permit injunction that 
prohibited him from possessing and/
or purchasing a firearm. Williams told officers he only owned the gun for protection.
A woman who lives with Williams declined to com-
ment Monday afternoon.

Tips for a Safe Break:
About 1,800 college students 
die every year from alcohol-relat-
ed injuries and about 600,000 college students are unintention-ally injured every year.
Tips for students:Start drinking late, at about 
11 p.m., and finish early, at about 1 a.m. Pace yourself to about a drink an hour.
Set a limit ahead of time and 
alternate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.
Eat before drinking and snack 
throughout the night.
Information is from the Gator-
Well website and Maureen Miller, 
coordinator for alcohol and other 
drugs prevention for GatorWell 
Health Promotion Services. Williams

School Shooting
Parents and children are reunited Monday at Chardon Middle School in Chardon, Ohio, after a shoot-
ing at Chardon High School. A teenager described as an outcast at the suburban Cleveland high school opened fire in the cafeteria Monday, killing one student and wounding four others before he was chased from the building by a teacher and captured a short distance away, authorities said.
� THE RULES DON’T 
APPLY TO CALLS FROM POLITICAL GROUPS.
CASEY MACIOGE
Alligator Contributing Writer
With election day loom-
ing, some city residents have 
answered their phones to hear 
recorded voices urging them 
to vote.
But political calls aren’t the 
only robotic calls reaching res-
idents. Unwanted telemarket-
ing calls and texts were in the top three complaint categories at the Federal Communica -
tions Commission in 2011.
In the wake of the com-
plaints, the FCC has adopted new rules to weed out some unwanted calls, according to a 
news release.
Despite the high number of 
these types of calls from polit-
ical organizations during the recent elections in Florida, the 
new restrictions only apply to 
telemarketing companies. 
Some of the new rules that 
apply only to telemarketers 
include:
- Requiring telemarketers 
to get prior written consent, 
which includes consent given on a website form, from the 
caller before placing a robotic 
call to a consumer.
- Requiring telemarket-
ers to provide an automated “opt-out” option during each robotic call so consumers can immediately tell the tele-
marketer to stop calling their 
phones.
“Political organizations 
and charities are exempt,” said 
Janice Wise, a spokeswoman 
for the FCC.  “They are pro-tected by the First Amend -
ment and have to adhere to separate guidelines.”
Wise said political robotic 
calls to cellphones will still require some kind of consent, but it doesn’t necessarily have 
to be in writing because the 
calls are not for telemarketing purposes.
Spiro Kiousis, chairman of 
the public relations depart-
ment at UF, said the calls are 
important because they get  the candidates’ message out to voters.
“I believe they are effective 
at providing information to voters and for reinforcing vot-ers inclined to support a can-didate,” Kiousis said.
According to the release, 
the rules also make sure that informational calls, such as those related to school closings 
and flight changes, continue 
to be available to consumers who wish to receive them.
Wise said the FCC cannot 
comment on whether or not 
additional restrictions on ro-
botic calls will be implement-ed in the future.FCC adopts new rules

Although Gainesville police chief Tony Jones said 
crime rates are down this year from last, he still thinks 
there’s room for improvement.  
Jones laid out GPD’s plan for the year and addressed 
residents’ concerns about graffiti, fliers in residential ar -
eas and people lying on sidewalks at a town hall meet-ing Monday night. About 100 Gainesville residents and officials attended.
Jones said crime in Gainesville showed an overall 
decrease from 2010 to 2011. He couldn’t provide exact numbers because they’re still being verified by the FBI.
GPD’s goal is to reduce crime by another 5 percent in 2012, he said.
To keep up the trend, Jones said GPD will create a 
more efficient system for officers to respond to incidents, 
improve GPD’s marketing strategy, put a greater emphasis on staff ac-countability and increase the pres-ence of Citizens on Patrol, a volunteer corps of residents that would act as extra eyes and ears for police.
GPD’s official plan will be released 
in mid-March, Jones said. This is the 
second year he’s offered a strategic 
plan, which incorporates concerns 
from residents as well as police officers and personnel.

  Support growing for 
marijuana legalization
  In October of 2011, a Gallup poll showed for the ﬁ  rst time 
ever more Americans supported the legalization of mari-juana than opposed it.
  The survey showed that 50 percent of Americans supported 
legalization, while 46 percent opposed it — a virtual ﬂ  ip from 
the previous year.
  When broken down by demographic and geographic vari-
ables, only a few groups showed less than majority support for 
legalization.
  Among groups with the lowest levels of support (less than 
35 percent) were those 65 and older, conservatives and Repub-licans. All other demographic groups still indicated support above 45 percent.
  Perhaps this growing support is one of the reasons that 
many states are pushing for more relaxed policies surrounding marijuana.
  In California, Sen. Mark Leno, D–San Francisco, introduced 
a bill that would demote simple drug possession charges from a felony to a misdemeanor. While it includes no changes on the sale, production or distribution of drugs, those found in pos-session of small quantities would receive more relaxed penal-ties.
  The goal, Leno said, is to reduce the number of nonviolent 
drug offenders in prison. A news release issued by Leno about the bill reads, “The Legislative Analyst’s Ofﬁ  ce estimates re-ducing penalties for drug possession will save counties about $159 million annually, in addition to yearly savings for the state totaling $64.4 million.”
  For a states like California that face major budget crises, a 
simple change like this could go a long way.
  In Colorado on Monday, it was announced that voters 
would be deciding on a ballot initiative in November that 
would decriminalize the possession of up to 1 ounce of mari-
juana for adults 21 and older. It would also permit, according to the Drug Policy Alliance, “small-scale cultivation for per-sonal consumption.”
  The state of Washington will also have a similar initiative 
on its ballot in November.
  These steps toward legalization across the country show 
that more Americans are realizing that the War on Drugs is not working.
  Reformers in the early 20th century thought they could con-
trol and discourage the use of alcohol by making it illegal. As a result, Prohibition created a culture of underground crime, giving rise to gangsters like Al Capone.
  The prohibition of drugs in the U.S. has also created to the 
same unintended consequences, leading to an increase in drug-related crimes within our cities and across the border.
  We own our bodies and should be able to do whatever we 
want with them. As long as no one else is being hurt in the 
process, our personal habits should not be of concern to nosey 
nanny staters and bureaucratic busybodies.
  Let us hope that these efforts continue throughout the coun-
try.  Race shouldn’t be a factor in admissions
  On every kind of application or form, whether for 
a doctor’s ofﬁ  ce or a job, you will often ﬁ  nd six 
familiar, conﬁ  ning checkmark boxes that list the 
following: white, black or African-American, Hispanic/
Latino, Asian or Paciﬁ  c Islander, Native American and 
other.
  As students, we’ve had to deal with this borderline in-
sulting question on all sorts of academic paperwork, as if all achievements relied on our choice of broad categoriza-
tion of the human race. Sometimes we can’t help but won-
der if it’s a matter of acceptance or denial.
  What’s most unfortunate is how the race game has cre-
ated disadvantages for Asian-American students.
  Studies have found that Asian students are held to an 
unfair stereotype of outstanding SAT math scores and sky-rocketing GPAs, and the competition is dense.
  Asian-Americans score higher on standardized tests 
than any other ethnic group, including whites. The pool 
of overqualiﬁ  ed Asian candidates for college admission is 
brimming.
  Because of these positive statistics, the Asian category 
has become toxic. The cookie-cutter label of the computer-brained, math-inclined nerd is something human beings 
cannot always live up to.
  Some of mixed race are opting just to check the “white” 
box. Others, feeling as though they couldn’t limit them-
selves to just one box choose the “multiracial” option.
  Props to those who leave the boxes blank. Your name 
will be the only clue for your admissions ofﬁ  cer — as it should be.
  Some brave and conﬁ  dent souls would be damned if 
they denied their race for the sake of a school, job or in-ternship. Many honestly identify themselves, aware of the chance of being unfairly discriminated.
  What message do universities and academic institu-
tions give to Asian-American students? Conversely, what 
message does it send to students who identify themselves 
as African American or Hispanic — ethnic groups that tend to have lower test scores?  As a child of an American 
father and a Cuban mother, I’ll 
admit I’m guilty of marking 
“Hispanic” because I thought it would give me a leg-up on the 
competition.
  College is a time of knowl-
edge and self-discovery. It is not 
the time for an identity crisis.
  The practice of considering 
race as a factor of admission fosters stereotypes, and these universities are hypocritically retrograding to prejudice 
instead of progressing forward toward universal accep-
tance.
  UF has a very diverse student body, an asset so many 
other schools crave. Diversity says a lot about the uni-versity: It’s appealing to a large variety of students who 
choose to bring their talents here.
  I’m not accusing UF of ﬁ  lling quotas and playing the 
race card, I just think the university — and all others, too 
— should ditch the race questions altogether. Using quo-
tas is like ﬁ  ghting racism with racism: Someone always 
remains stunted in his or her check box.
  The afﬁ  rmative action practices, once meant to combat 
racial discrimination, have morphed into reverse discrimi-nation. Do away with the racial boxes, and the competi-
tion will decrease for Asians, but fairly raise the bar for 
everyone else. California has a law that prohibits state in-
stitutions from considering race in admissions. Bravo.
  Instead of playing the race card, universities should 
follow California’s lead of an equal admission process 
and focus on creating a diverse student body on the basis 
of accepting well-rounded students. Test scores and GPA 
should, of course, be a priority in the selection process, but admissions ofﬁ  cers should look into the skills, talents and 
community involvement of applicants.
  That’s true diversity.  Colleen Wright is a journalism freshman at UF. Her column

Alligator was right to report newspaper theft
I am writing this letter to point out the atrocities 
that have occurred at the hands of the Unite Party.
Specifically, I note that Jason Tiemeier, Student 
Senate president pro tempore and member of the 
Unite Party, was found stealing and disposing of more than 200 copies of the Alligator. Tiemeier re-futes the story, states that he was not there and was, in fact, sleeping at the time of the alleged incident.
But the Alligator, in following journalistic custom, 
supported its allegations with eyewitnesses Taylor Chambers, Elizabeth Hamilton and a source affiliated with the Unite Party.
Jason E. Handin subsequently wrote a letter con-
demning the Alligator, saying it should be “ashamed 
of themselves for their reliance on dirty and classless 
political tactics.” By foregoing reading, Handin has assumed his brother’s innocence without a second thought.
It becomes a serious predicament when Handin 
suggests civil litigation. It is true that Tiemeier is well within his rights to go to court for any frivolous claim.
However, Handin forgets that the truth is a com-
plete defense to defamation.
Even if Tiemeier did not steal the newspapers, the 
Alligator’s witnesses provide an excellent foundation for 1) the publication of the article and 2) the judicial dismissal of Tiemeir’s claim. Any suggestion other -
wise would be arguing against our First Amendment 
rights.
It is my recommendation to the editor of the Alli-
gator — not legal advice, as neither Handin nor I can 
give you any now — to therefore embrace any and all 
litigation, civil or criminal, and to ethically disclose 
your witnesses to the paper’s readers, the police and the court system if it is the right thing to do.
In sum, the Unite Party and its predecessors have 
a long track record of having some of its individuals commit dirty political tactics. Furthermore, the Unite Party has a reputation of distorting and covering up facts, especially in the electoral season.
I pray that the undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents of UF place more weight on reason and the law than on hollow conclusions and promises.

Greek councils condemn hazing
On behalf of the Greek community at UF, and in 
light of recent allegations, we would like to reinforce our stance against hazing.
As a Greek community, we are united by our four 
core values of scholarship, service, leadership and community.
Hazing tarnishes these values and contradicts our 
purpose and mission as fraternities and sororities and, therefore, has no place in our community.
The four Greek governing councils — the Inter -
fraternity Council, Multicultural Greek Council, Na-tional Pan-Hellenic Council, and Panhellenic Council — and their member organizations, along with UF, have and enforce strict policies against hazing.
We do not condone or encourage any acts of haz-
ing.
We are committed to the belief that acts of hazing 
do not foster unity or loyalty and do not build char -
acter or leadership skills. Although we, as the Florida Greek community, understand that hazing is not nec-essarily a problem unique to fraternities and sorori-ties, we will continue to take the necessary actions to help lead the charge against hazing on UF’s campus.
The safety of our members, old and new, has been 
and always will be a priority.

Conflict-free campaigning.
That was the goal for both parties during the UF 
Student Government Spring 2012 General Election, 
and as election week drew near, it looked like the univer -
sity would see a spotless finish to a semester of platform-
based movements.
Then, on Feb. 20, two separate eyewitnesses reported 
that an individual wearing a Unite Party T-shirt had thrown away 268 copies of The Independent Florida Alligator.
A majority of the Student Body’s first exposure to the 
incident was the next day’s edition of the Alligator, which featured one staff report and two editorials focused on the 
paper-trashing.
Overnight, an election season, which had been distin-
guishably clean and fair, lost its message of positive cam-
paigning, and our campus returned to its habitual ways of 
character-assassination politics.
I can only describe the result as one of the most surpris-
ing and aggressive attacks I have ever seen from a large 
portion of the UF Greek community.
People weren’t just angry with what was published — 
they were livid. Social networks were overrun with stu-dents’ backlash at the Alligator, by both Student Govern-ment parties and their fellow students.
“The only thing the alligator is independent of is integ-
rity.”
“I threw a copy of the Alligator away today. Are they 
going to write an article about it?”
These insults and more flooded my Facebook newsfeed 
for hours on Tuesday and Wednesday last week.
As a member of the Greek community and a student 
studying journalism, I witnessed my friends from other so-rorities and fraternities who work for the Alligator feel the backlash from this defamation of their personal integrity 
and the publication’s integrity.
They had become villains because of an article they 
hadn’t even written, guilty by professional association.
And just how quickly did we forget the Alligator’s be-
lief in the Unite Party’s ability to complete platforms and better our university? Last spring, the Alligator chose to 
endorse the Unite Party and has done so multiple times in the past.
The paper was still publishing letters to the editor that 
favored the Unite Party less than a week before elections.
Profiles of both sets of executive-ticket members were 
run two days before elections.
Even so, a large amount of us still chose to believe that the largest student-run newspaper in the U.S. was a biased publication when it reported on Beatrice Diehl’s 
negative personal experiences as a 
member of the Greek community during these elections.
We chose to write slanderous things about members of 
our houses who worked for the Alligator after the paper ran an editorial reprimanding dirty politics.
We chose to make the gap between Greek and non-
Greek students even wider by disowning our own friends as political enemies and bringing national attention to our 
university through extremist websites like TotalFratMove.
com.
But are we justified in doing any of these things?Should we think it fair that we blindly label our broth-
ers and sisters as propagandists because their professional affiliation doesn’t agree with ours? Should we openly criti-cize one of our member’s attempts to legitimately advance his or her career if it might steal a few votes from another who is running for office, but ignore those scorning their 
fellow Greeks for practicing their most basic democratic 
rights?
Should these Greeks feel ashamed for not being a part 
of the majority?
The answer is no.We have been responsible for making our fellow Greeks 
victims of a Student-Government groupthink that has become the basis of an intense double standard based on party loyalty in the UF Greek system.
We are becoming bigoted with “our party” to the point of 
becoming prejudiced toward some of our closest friends.
We cannot label ourselves as leaders in our community 
while remaining so intolerant of the beliefs of others.
Acts and arguments showing unprecedented hatred to-
ward an organization or another group of students were exactly what both the Unite Party and Students Party were trying to avoid in this year’s election.
If this election taught us anything, it would be that next 
year we cannot let ourselves regress to mudslinging and finger-pointing politics after a semester of campaigns based on ambitious platforms and uniting the Student Body.
For now, it’s up to both sides of this election to reunite 
the Student Body as a whole and to continue improving our university through Student Government.

Researchers led by scientists from UF and 
the University of Nebraska recently found a 
link between animals’ body size and global temperatures.
The researchers’ study, released Feb. 24 in 
Science magazine, shows that as temperatures increased, the size of the earliest horses de-creased.
“Especially on a specific scale, what we’ve 
shown is climate can influence the evolution of mammals in a direct way,” said Johnathan Bloch, co-author and Florida Museum of Nat-ural History associate curator of vertebrate paleontology.Sifrhippus, the earliest known horse, first 
appeared about 56 million years ago. The 
horse lived during a 175,000-year span of 
global warming, Bloch said.
During this period, temperatures rose 
about 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
Horses started out about the size of minia-
ture schnauzers, Bloch said. The researchers used the teeth to measure body size evolu-tion.
The research traced the evolution of the 
12-pound horse as it shrank to about 8 pounds — the size of a small house cat, he said. Then the horse’s weight climbed to about 15 pounds.
The size change corresponds to global 
warming and subsequent cooling.Researchers also sampled oxygen and car -
bon atoms with varying masses in the tooth 
enamel of Coryphodon, which are hoofed ani-
mals associated with water environments.
Scientists have a better record of them, said 
co-author and UF anthropology professor John Krigbaum. The Coryphodon were sampled to get a measure of relative shift in climate.
Krigbaum said masses of the atoms were 
used to evaluate the changing environment and the animals’ changing diet.
He said the tooth size and atom mass 
changed similarly over time.
Bloch said it was about seven years ago 
when co-author Stephen Chester, a UF un-dergraduate at the time, measured horse teeth and found they weren’t the same size for the whole period. He said it was an obvious pat-
tern as they collected more data.
“It was the first key there was something 
going on we didn’t know about,” Bloch said.

U.S. Marshals arrested a 
violent fugitive Monday in 
Gainesville after tracking him for six days.
The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment issued an arrest warrant for John-Paul Sampson, 28, on Feb. 14 on charges of aggravated stalking of a female after she filed a no-contact order against him. They handed the case over to U.S. Marshals eight days later because of Sampson’s violent history, ac-cording to deputy U.S. Marshal 
Bryon Carroll.
According to the GPD investi-
gation, Sampson was sitting in his 
car in the victim’s parking lot at 10 p.m. on Feb. 14. When the vic-tim arrived in her car and spotted Sampson, she drove away. Samp-son followed her “bumper to bumper” for 3 miles, cursing and yelling at her to pull over. He tried to cut her off but she continued to 
drive. He then stopped following 
her, and she alerted authorities.
In August, Sampson was ar -
rested in Gainesville on charges of battery and domestic abuse. He also regularly carried firearms, Carroll said, adding that Samp-son had been sleeping at different places in the city every night
Marshals obtained information 
Monday morning that Sampson was staying with a female friend on Southwest 20th Ave. Carroll said about eight task force mem-bers surrounded the apartment complex and arrested Sampson at approximately 2:45 p.m.
Carroll said Sampson did not 
put up a fight while they hand-cuffed him.

SILVER RIVER STATE PARK 
— Controversey has erupted 
over the work of a trapper who, 
with state permission, has over the past decade captured about 
700 monkeys from the wild.
Silver River State Park man-
ager Sally Leib said she and oth-er state officials are torn about 
what to do about a species con-sidered both a tourist attraction 
and a health hazard.
Exactly what the trapper, 
Scott Cheslak, is doing with the young monkeys he captures is 
something of a mystery. His state permits say he cannot kill them 
or display them, but that’s all.
Cheslak files annual reports, but they only list how many 
monkeys he caught and whether they had diseases. He did not re-
spond to phone calls and emails 
requesting comment.
Cheslak used to work for a 
company named Alpha Genesis that supplies monkeys to scien-tific research laboratories. The 
CEO, Greg Westergaard, says 
the Silver Springs monkeys that Cheslak captured were used to 
breed other monkeys to be used 
for research.
However, Westergaard said 
he ended the trapping because he decided it was wrong to cage monkeys that had been wild for 
so long. He said he did not know 
for whom Cheslak is trapping monkeys now, or why.Capture of Silver Springs

A queen was crowned at the Miss University 
of Florida Pageant Monday night.
The pageant, hosted by Florida Blue Key, 
was held at the Phillips Center for the Perform-
ing Arts, where 12 contestants competed for the 
crown, a $1,000 scholarship and a spot in the 2012 
Miss Florida pageant this summer.
About 600 people watched as Ashlyn Robin-
son was named Miss UF. 
Robinson is a telecommunication and history 
sophomore from Plant City.
The pageant was funded mainly by advertis-
ers, sponsors and ticket sales. It costs $10,000 to put on annually.
Grace Faulkenberry, Florida Blue Key’s divi-
sion coordinator, said the pageant is different from other pageants because it is university-based.
“This year, we definitely made an extra effort 
to reach out through emails, phone calls, text mes-sages to a different variety of on-campus organi-zations,” Faulkenberry said. “We reached out a little further and were a little more persistent in getting organizations other than the ones who have participated in the past.”
Five judges watched as the candidates com-
peted in an onstage Q&A session, an evening wear portion, a talent competition and a lifestyle and fitness swimsuit portion.
Faulkenberry said Florida Blue Key tried to get 
judges who have some type of correlation with 
the university and ties to the pageant world.
The Miss UF pageant also partnered with 
Dance Marathon and the Children’s Miracle Net-
work to welcome a Miracle Child to the stage.
After an announcer told her story of overcom-
ing disease, 10-year-old Cat Chennel gracefully walked across the stage in her platform heels and waved to the audience like a pageant contestant.
“Because DM plays such a large role on our 
campus, we didn’t want to leave out that sector,” Faulkenberry said. Miss UF crowned Monday night

BEIRUT — A Syrian activist 
group reported Monday that 144 
people have been killed across the country, scores of them in the em-
battled opposition stronghold of 
Homs by security forces as they 
tried to flee.
A team from the Syrian arm of 
the Red Cross delivered aid to one 
of the city’s most dangerous neigh-
borhoods after days of trying to 
reach the area.
The activist group did not say 
whether all 144 died on Monday or were killed over the past few 
days. Many of the casualties were 
believed to be from the rebel-con-
trolled Baba Amr neighborhood of Homs, which the Syrian Arab Red Crescent entered late Monday.
Also in the neighborhood are 
two wounded foreign journalists, along with the bodies of two of their colleagues who were killed last week.
European and American dip-
lomats and aid workers have been trying desperately to find a way to evacuate them, but Red Cross spokeswoman Carla Haddad said 
late Monday that the Red Cres-
cent had not managed to get them 
out. She did not know whether the group had stopped trying for the evening.
Homs has emerged as the center 
of the 11-month-old uprising seek-ing to oust authoritarian President Bashar Assad and has borne the brunt of his regime’s bloody crack-down on dissent. Parts of the city have been surrounded for weeks, making it impossible for rescue workers to reach the wounded and for families to bring their dead and injured to the hospital.
Reports by numerous activists that the bodies of more than 60 peo-ple were brought to the hospital, all of whom appeared to have died in one incident, reflect the spreading carnage.
The high death toll reported by 
the Local Coordination Commit-tees activist group is sure to add to the growing international pressure on Assad to give up power. But so far, his regime has shown no signs that it is ready to leave peacefully.
Syrian officials announced the 
results of a referendum on a new constitution held Sunday that Syr -
ian authorities lauded as a step to-ward political reform.
The referendum allows, at least 
in theory, for opening the coun-try’s political system. It approves a new constitution, which allows for a multiparty system in Syria, which has been ruled by the Baath party since it took power in a coup in 1963. Assad’s father, Hafez, took power in another coup in 1970.
It also imposes a limit of two 
seven-year terms on the president, meaning Assad could remain legal-ly in power through 2028.
The U.S. and its allies dismissed 
the vote as a “farce” meant to jus-tify the regime’s bloody crackdown on dissent. Syria’s main opposition groups boycotted the vote, and vio-lence elsewhere prevented polling.
Syrian state TV said 89 percent 
of eligible voters approved the new document, while nine percent re-jected it. It put turnout at 57 percent of Syria’s 14.9 million eligible vot-ers.
Representatives of more than 60 
countries met in Tunisia last week to forge a unified strategy to push Assad from power and began plan-ning a civilian peacekeeping mis-sion to deploy after the regime falls. On Monday, the European Union imposed new sanctions.
Syria has been able to count on 
allies China and Russia to protect it from condemnation by the U.N. Security Council. Both staunchly opposed any interference in Syria’s affairs.
Russian Prime Minister Vladi-mir Putin warned Monday against military intervention in Syria and blasted the West, saying it had backed the Arab Spring to advance its interests in the region.
In Damascus, a Syrian official 
accused the West of trying to desta-bilize the country for its own gain and warned that militarizing the opposition is a big mistake that will backfire.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ji-
had Makdissi told The Associated Press in a rare interview that dia-logue among all parties is the only way to end the conflict.
“The West took advantage of the 
awakening of the Syrian street. In-stead of helping Syria to overcome this painful crisis, they are using this to hit the stability of Syria for other geopolitical reasons,” he said.
Activists groups said Monday 
that the death toll for 11 months 
of unrest has now surpassed 8,000 
people.
The diplomatic pressure on Syr -
ia comes as the humanitarian and 
security situation on the ground is 
collapsing. The Local Coordination 
Committees said 64 of those report-ed dead on Monday were fleeing shelling in the Baba Amr neighbor -
hood of Homs when security forces 
stopped them at a checkpoint in the 
city’s Abil area and killed them.
Another activist in Baba Amr, 
reached via Skype, said a security officer who had seen a report on the incident leaked its contents to activ-ists, with whom he sympathizes.
The activist, Abu Mohammed 
Ibrahim, said the group left the neighborhood Sunday evening and were stopped at a checkpoint, where security forces loaded them onto four buses. A while later, the buses stopped and the soldiers started killing passengers. Locals found the bodies dumped in two places outside of town on Monday, the activist said.

FLINT, Mich. — Regardless of the outcome of Repub-
lican presidential primaries in Michigan and Arizona on 
Tuesday, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum appear headed for a showdown next week in Ohio.
Both candidates plan to dash there later this week. The 
candidates and their allies already are spending heavily on advertising in the Buckeye State. It’s one of 10 that vote a 
week from Tuesday, with 419 delegates to the Republican 
National Convention at stake.
“An awful lot of Ohioans are just tuning in to this,” said 
Terry Casey, a veteran Republican campaign strategist in that state. “It’s going to be a sprint.”
The race in Ohio is likely to mirror that of Michigan, an-
other Rust Belt state where the economy is the main issue. Romney and Santorum have spent the past week squaring 
off over who is more conservative.
Beyond Ohio, Romney was looking to contests in the 
West while Santorum focuses on the South.
Rival Newt Gingrich, seeking to inject momentum into 
his struggling bid, was working to make his stand in his for -
mer home state of Georgia and nearby Southern states that 
also vote on the mega-contest day of March 6. The former House speaker told reporters Sunday: “We hope to win in Georgia, we hope to do well in Oklahoma and Tennessee. We may surprise people in Idaho. We think we have a real fighting chance in Ohio.”
Ron Paul also planned events in upcoming states, show-
ing no willingness to abandon his quest to rack up enough delegates to ensure his followers have a voice at the late-
summer convention and that the Republican Party which 
once spurned him welcomes him back into the fold.
All of the divergent strategies suggest the race could go 
deep into March — if not beyond — without giving any of the candidates a significant edge.
It’s a scenario that all the candidates are 
anticipating.
“Look, this is going to be a long race, 
and there’s going to be some ups and 
downs,” Santorum, a former Pennsylva-
nia senator, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”
On “Fox News Sunday,” Romney, a 
former Massachusetts governor, chimed in with: “How long the process goes on, I 
think it’s hard to predict.”
Gingrich argued that a drawn-out campaign would give 
states like California, which holds its primary June 5, a large role in the nominating contest.
Heading into Tuesday’s contests, Romney leads in the 
race to amass the most delegates with 123. Santorum has 72, while Gingrich and Paul have 32 and 19, respectively. The totals include endorsements from Republican National Committee members who will automatically attend the party’s national convention and can support any candidate they choose.
A candidate needs 1,144 delegates to secure the nomina-
tion.
Both Arizona and Michigan each lost half their delegates 
for holding contests before March 6.
Whoever wins Arizona, where polls show Romney with 
a lead, will get all 29 of the state’s delegates. But Michigan will divide its 30 delegates by giving 2 to the winner of each of the 14 congressional districts in the state. The final 2 delegates are awarded in proportion to the statewide vote, 
probably to the top two candidates, if both get more than 25 
percent of the vote.
Washington’s caucuses are Saturday, when 40 delegates 
are at stake, followed by Super Tuesday contests in Alaska (24), Georgia (76), Idaho (32), Massachusetts (38), North Dakota (28), Oklahoma (40), Ohio (63), Tennessee (55), Ver -
mont (17) and Virginia (46). Also, Wyoming Republicans will hold county conventions from March 6 through March 
10, with 12 delegates up for grabs.
After Tuesday, Delaware is the only state that awards all 
of its delegates to the one candidate who wins the popular 
vote, giving every candidate a chance to add to their totals.Ohio next state to witness Romney-Santorum showdownActivist group reports: 144 dead across Syria, most killed near Homs

� THE GATORS PLAY THE 
COMMODORES TONIGHT AT 9 ON ESPN. 
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
In Florida’s last meeting with 
Vanderbilt, Billy Donovan de-
cided to wait before throwing his 
full-court press at the Commo-dores, allowing both teams to en-
joy nearly three opening minutes 
of clean, turnover-free basketball.
He then unleashed Will Yeg-
uete.
Vanderbilt’s John Jenkins de-
scribed what happened next as the 
difference in the game. So did UF 
freshman Brad Beal, who referred to the Feb. 4 Southeastern Confer -
ence clash as the Gators’ best per -
formance up to that point.
After hitting their second shot, 
a jumper by Erving Walker, the Gators began to press, led by the 6-foot-7 Yeguete fresh off the 
bench and hovering at the front. 
Over the ensuing 37 minutes, UF forced 17 turnovers and scored 19 
points off bonus possessions to 
David Carr / Alligator
In the first meeting between Florida and Vanderbilt, the Gators forced 17 turnovers with their press defense and scored 19 points off those give-
aways in a 73-65 win. But coach Billy Donovan said Florida may change its approach tonight with forward Will Yeguete out of the lineup.

Baseball players don’t get a 
Spring Break. 
While their classmates will 
be flooding rundown watering 
holes in Key West or the Carib-bean next week, the Gators will be hosting the likes of Florida At-lantic, Florida A&M and Florida 
Gulf Coast. 
However, this week Florida 
will have one of the closest things 
there is to a bye week during a college baseball season. 
For one of only two times this 
season, No. 1 UF is not sched-uled to play a midweek game 
before it travels 
to Coral Gables on Friday for a showdown with No. 12 Miami.
“Not having 
any midweeks is great,” Gators coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We’ve got quite a few guys with 
some hamstring (injuries) — little 
nagging stuff. I think this is as good a time to not have any mid-weeks as we possibly could have 
so we can get some guys back to 
100 percent.”
Highlighting Florida’s early 
injury concerns are junior catcher Mike Zunino and freshman sec-
ond baseman Casey Turgeon, two players whose bats have made a 
major impact in the early part of the season. 
Zunino currently leads the 
team in batting average (.440) but tweaked his hamstring during a rundown in the eighth inning of Saturday night’s 5-1 victory over 
William & Mary and sat out Sun-
day’s series finale, the first time he has missed an entire game

Greg: Billy Donovan is not insane. 
After weeks and weeks of trying to 
get Erving Walker to step up and be 
Florida’s vocal leader — the guy who can rally 
the troops and be the clear voice in the huddle 
when things aren’t going well — Donovan has 
given up. It’s just not going to happen. Leader -
ship is not in Walker’s DNA. 
“The definition of insanity is doing the same 
thing over and over and expecting a different result,” Donovan said. “After a dead ball or a free-throw situation, there needs to be more huddling our guys there. Whether he forgets to do it or doesn’t do it or doesn’t feel comfortable doing it, I’ve got to get someone else to 
do it because that 
needs to happen.”
So the ques-
tion is: Which Gator should take charge? 
The answer is Brad Beal. Florida’s best and 
most consistent player needs to be the one to take the reins. Any-one else would be out of place.  
John: I whole-
heartedly agree that Beal has turned out to be a tremendous talent for Florida this season, but we 
also need to judge whether it’s in his nature to lead this team from a vocal standpoint.
Though he tops UF in a number of offensive and defensive categories, including overall re-bounding and free throws, we haven’t seen if Beal has the charisma and savvy as a freshman to lead by anything other than example. 
Last week, it took a fiery halftime speech by 
Billy Donovan to inspire the Gators to a come-back win against Auburn.
That’s what Florida needs in a leader — 
someone who has the tools to control a huddle with his presence on the court when things go awry.
Someone like Patric Young.

“If Erving Walker is open, and he’s got a 3-point shot, I want him to shoot 
it. What else is he gonna do? I mean, is he going to drive into the lane

“He should be fine for the Miami se-
ries,” O’Sullivan said. 
Turgeon was removed from Sun-
day’s game after lining a double to right 
in the fourth inning. O’Sullivan said he had been having some hamstring tight-
ness and wanted to be cautious with the 
idea of him rounding third on a rainy 
day. 
He has hit in all but one of Florida’s 
games this season and has not commit-
ted an error at second since the first ball 
he fielded on opening night. 
A four-day break could also mean 
getting a player back into the lineup 
who has not yet seen the field this sea-son. 
O’Sullivan said last week that sopho-
more third baseman Zack Powers could  return from a shoulder injury for the William & Mary series. 
Offensively, the timing could be right 
as freshman Josh Tobias has started six games at third this year and batted .118 (2 for 17) to start his college career. He has also committed two of Florida’s five 
errors on the young season. After Sunday, one of the most note-
worthy storylines this week will be 
starting pitcher Karsten Whitson, who has struggled in his first two outings following a strong early spring. 
“It’s just normal, early-season arm 
stuff,” O’Sullivan said. “I don’t see it being anything serious. When you have a special arm like that, you don’t want 
to take any chances.”
Whitson missed a majority of fall 
practice with a groin injury and lasted 
just 13 pitches and two-thirds of an 
inning in Sunday’s game against the 
Tribe. 
O’Sullivan has said his arm just 
hasn’t bounced back as fast this season as some of the other pitchers, but UF’s 
coach added that there are no major 
worries.
“We just want all of our guys to feel 
like they’re 100 percent, and they will 
be,” O’Sullivan said. TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Gators will rely on Beal to replace Yeguete in press defense role
outpace Vanderbilt in a 73-65 win. 
More than three weeks before his season-
ending foot injury, Yeguete was able to take 
credit for three of the Gators’ nine steals that afternoon — a team-high. He also had 
a block and eight rebounds.
Heading into Memorial Gym tonight at 
9, Donovan is unsure if the same result will follow No. 16 Florida (22-7, 10-4 SEC) for its 
road trip to Vanderbilt (20-9, 9-5 SEC).
“The press was really, really good here, 
but make no mistake about it, the press started in a lot of ways with Will,” Donovan said. “He had a huge impact in the game 
in the press. So whether or not we can get 
the same result out of the press in Nash-ville that we did here in Gainesville, I don’t 
know.”Though the Gators are generally hesitant 
to press heavily on the road, the turnover-
prone Commodores have shown they are susceptible to mistakes even in their own 
gym. Vanderbilt has endured six home 
games this season with 15 or more give-aways and is in the bottom half of the 
league rankings in turnovers per game and 
percentage.  
Without Yeguete, Donovan said if Flor -
ida chooses to press it will primarily rely on Beal, who has a team-best 38 steals, and 6-foot-6 sophomore Casey Prather off the 
bench to help trap ball-handlers in the open 
court.
“It will be something that we will defi-
nitely look at and definitely do, but I would imagine that would be something that Van-derbilt would obviously be working on, fo-
cused on, and like I said earlier, most teams 
do a better job handling the press at home than they do the road,” Donovan said.
Through 14 SEC games, Vanderbilt has 
built up the SEC’s second-leading scoring offense be-
hind Jenkins’ league-high 
20 points per game and se-nior guard Jeffery Taylor’s 
average of 17.3 points.
While the Commo-
dores are also shooting a conference-leading 42.3 
percent from three, the 
Gators held them  more than 10 percentage 
points under their league average in Febru-
ary on 8-of-25 shooting. 
“That’s going to be one of our biggest 
challenges since the first game because those guys are so great at scoring,” Beal said. “Their whole team is so good at us-
ing screens and creating offense off of those 
screens, so we  basically just have to main-tain our composure on defense and then just be mentally ready for everything that comes to us.”
As Beal and the rest of Florida’s guards 
try to slow down Vanderbilt’s perimeter at-tack, members of the Gators’ thinned front-court like Patric Young will be trying to 
simply remain on the court.
Due to foul trouble, Young played spar -
ingly in UF’s first meeting with Vanderbilt and had just two points and four rebounds 
in 14 minutes.
“I’m just going to have to play smart,” 
Young said. “With Will out, I definitely can-not afford to get into foul trouble. Our team, we lack the depth, and to have to go smaller 
against one of the teams that’s already big 
— one of the biggest teams in our confer -
ence — we’ll have to play a lot smarter.”

Greg: Young may bring the explosive energy , but Beal is no 
slouch in that department, either.
In fact, I doubt any play UF has made this season was more 
explosive than Beal’s dunk over Alabama’s Moussa Gueye. Ex-cept maybe Beal’s dunk over South Carolina’s Damontre Har -
ris. If you don’t believe me, YouTube it. 
On top of that, Beal brings consistency . Beal has posted at least 13 points, six rebounds and 30 min-
utes in every game this month. That constant presence is abso-lutely vital in a front man. 
“In that role, you have to be a consistent guy every single 
day ,” Donovan said.  
Beal has the smarts, commitment to hard work and flat-out 
talent that nobody else on this team can boast. Especially not Patric Young, who admitted Monday that, “Honestly, some-times there’s days where you just don’t want to practice.” 
Maybe there are days you don’t want to practice, Patric, but 
Florida’s leader can’t afford to feel that way. 
John: You’re taking Young’s quote out of context, Greg. 
Poor practice habits have been a team-wide problem this sea-son that every player, including Beal, needs to improve upon, 
according to Donovan. 
While Young may not be a model of consistency, no player 
outside of Will Yeguete has had worse luck with injuries. 
Despite a nagging ankle injury that’s hampered him 
throughout SEC play, Young has yet to miss any of Florida’s 29 
games. His toughness can’t be questioned.
As he inches closer to being 100-percent healthy , Young’s 
shown flashes of how he can lead this team though his pro-duction by scoring 19 points at Alabama and hauling in 11 re-
bounds over the weekend at Georgia.
“I definitely would love to eventually come into that role,” 
he said.
 Unlike Florida’s guards, Young actually aspires and wants 
to be the team leader.
Greg: That may be true, but don’t paint it like he’s the only 
one. 
When Donovan approached Beal about potentially assum-
ing a greater leadership role, the freshman didn’t shy away. 
“I told him that I was more than willing to do that,” Beal 
said. “We’re talking on the floor all the time anyways. On top 
of that, I’m real cool with the guys and I know everybody , so I feel more comfortable doing that.”
Although Young has shown flashes, his injuries, persistent 
foul trouble and inconsistent energy mean he needs to focus more on staying on the court than encouraging his teammates. 
You can’t command every huddle and lead the rally after every possession when you only play 25 minutes per game, as 
Young does. 
That role is better left to a constant presence like Beal, whose 
34.4 minutes per game are the most any Gator has played in 
the past 10 years. 
John: I think Donovan would disagree with needing a lead-
er who’s constantly on the court. 
One of the three players, along with Young and Beal, the 
Gators’ coach wanted to see help “mentally connect” his team-
mates was Scottie Wilbekin, who plays little more than 14 min-
utes per game.
Though Young has been under Donovan’s scrutiny this sea-
son, so was last year’s clear-cut leader Chandler Parson early in his career.
“I was very, very difficult on him for his career, but Chan-
dler was always an outspoken guy; he wanted to be a leader, he wanted that role,” Donovan said. “I think Patric has great leadership qualities, but I think Patric still has some growth 
and maturing to do.” 
By the time he was a senior, Parsons had grown into the 
SEC Player of the Year, and with the adversity Young has seen 
this season, he has a chance to do the same if he stays for his last two years.
But why wait? Young can start by stepping up in the final 
stretch of this season.

Florida junior forward Jennifer George notched her SEC-leading 14th 
double-double against Tennessee with 11 points and 11 boards.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
As the second-leading rebounder 
in the Southeastern Conference, Jen-
nifer George has not faced many 
individual opponents she could not 
handle.
George has averaged 17.7 points 
and eight rebounds against the 
three best statistical rebounders 
she’s faced this season — Florida State’s Natasha Howard, Ole Miss’ Nikki Byrd and Vanderbilt’s Tiffany Clarke.
However, George said Friday 
that going up against No. 10 Ten-nessee’s Glory Johnson, the SEC rebounding leader at 9.3 boards per 
contest, would be much different.
“Glory Johnson may be the best 
athlete in college basketball and in 
the SEC,” George said. “[Facing players like Johnson] definitely is 
one of the reasons why I chose Flor -
ida.”
Johnson proved her worth in the 
Volunteers’ 75-59 victory against the Gators on Sunday, scoring a game-
high 21 points and grabbing 10 re-bounds.
George did hold her own, record-
ing her SEC-leading 14th double-
double of the season with 11 points 
and 11 rebounds.
However, George shot just 33.3 
percent from the field, her worst 
mark since a 3-of-9 clip in an 81-56 
win against Samford on Dec. 28.
“I thought George could’ve fin-
ished a few more shots,” Butler said. “She’s going to feel that way too when she sees the film.”
While her offensive struggles 
hurt, George and the rest of Florida’s frontcourt had the most trouble try-ing to contain Johnson defensively.
George and Azania Stewart 
racked up four fouls each, contribut-
ing to Johnson’s team-high five made 
free throws in seven attempts.
“We got behind too often on de-
fense,” Butler said. “[Johnson] posts 
so aggressively that if you’re not a step ahead … [she]’s gonna make you pay.”
Mentioning Johnson and George 
in the same sentence did not seem possible the last time the Gators and the Volunteers played.
When Tennessee beat Florida 92-
75 in the quarterfinals of the 2011 SEC Tournament, Johnson scored 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in 34 minutes. Meanwhile, George 
played only 13 minutes, scoring two 
points and grabbing six boards.
George averaged just 6.8 points 
and 5.6 rebounds per contest last sea-
son, never becoming a consistent fix-
ture in the lineup. However, George has made her presence known this season, leading the Gators with 12.8 points and nine rebounds per game.
Her improved effort in the paint 
includes a streak of eight straight double-doubles that lasted from Dec. 7 to Jan. 12.
“In the first two years of my ca-
reer, I think I wanted a backseat,” 
George said. “I wanted players in 
front of me to take the reins. Now, I’m looking for that more leadership role.”George has assumed more re-
sponsibility this season, starting 23 games and playing 800 minutes, the most of any Florida post player dur -
ing the regular season.
With the departures of Stewart 
and Ndidi Madu looming as post-
season play begins, George will 
need to continue taking on a heavier 
workload in the paint.
“I’ve always wanted to have 
an all-around game,” George said. “Once you do that, it makes it hard for defenders to defend me.”

Half a world away from home, Florent Diep 
is learning on the fly how to balance tennis and 
school.
The sophomore, who joined the Gators in 
January, came into collegiate tennis under un-
usual circumstances. The French native played 
34 matches professionally , mainly on the ITF Futures Tour, reaching a world ranking of 673. Last year, he decided to put his professional ca-reer on hold and come to Gainesville. 
Immediately, he faced challenges. Coach 
Andy Jackson, whose roster frequently includes foreign-born players, told Diep the switch to collegiate tennis wouldn’t be easy.
“He told me it would be hard. It would be a 
tough schedule, and I wouldn’t have much time for me,” Diep said. 
Aside from a different tennis environment, 
Diep faced becoming a college student in a for -
eign country . The language barrier that he faces is not impermeable, but his English still has a long way to go. 
“It’s hard for me because I don’t speak Eng-
lish very well,” he said. “I have to work more than other students. “ 
Luckily, he has help. Two years ago, Nassim 
Slilam had the same challenges. Now a senior, Slilam has served as a mentor to Diep and Flor -
ida’s two other French-born players, Stephane Piro and Thomas Proisy. Diep said the four of them frequently interact and that Slilam has been especially helpful with adjusting to college life.
On the court, however, Diep has been right at 
home. He has taken quite well to the concept of team tennis, especially after playing profession-ally as an individual for two years. 
“I like playing for the team. It’s completely 
different; college tennis is different in general,” he said. “I’m excited to play for the team and in 
the big tournaments like the NCAA.”
Since starting in January, Diep is 6-4 in sin-
gles play. His first match as a Gator, at then-No. 
5 Baylor, was a straight-set victory. Though he has been somewhat inconsistent through his 
first two months, Diep has showed resilience.
After losing two consecu-
tive matches, Diep responded with two straight-set wins against Illinois and Pepper -
dine. 
Still, he has plenty of room 
for growth. With more than two years left in Gainesville, 
there will be plenty of time for Diep to adjust 
to college life, practice English and improve his 
game. Playing almost exclusively on clay in Eu-rope, Diep has had to adjust to the hard courts found in college tennis. 
When asked about the difference, Diep had 
to think for a second. As if searching for words, he gave a succinct, simple answer.
“Yeah, it’s different,” he said. “But I have to 
improve.” 
Diep will have that opportunity today when 
UF plays USF at home at 3 p.m.Diep improving in transition to UFGOLF
STAFF REPORT
One Florida star decided to shine in 
Hollywood on Monday.
Junior T.J. Vogel, the No. 5 golfer in 
the nation, shot 10-under during the 
opening day of the Charleston Shoo-
tout in Hollywood, S.C., including 
a 3-under 69 in the first round and a 7-under 65 in the second round to sit in first individually.
Vogel bogeyed the first hole, but 
that was his only misstep on the day. He recorded nine birdies, and eagled the par-five, 540-yard 15th hole during his second round. 
Behind Vogel and fellow junior Ty-
ler McCumber, the No. 27 Gators (-19) sit in first place, 12 strokes ahead of sec-ond-place Augusta State entering the final day at the Links at Stono Ferry. 
McCumber carded a 4-under 68 
in the first round thanks to five bird-ies against one bogey, capping off the opening round with three birdies on 
his final five holes, including a pair of 
par fives.
The junior shot even-par in the sec-
ond round and is tied for fourth.
While the men sit in first after their 
opening day in Hollywood, the wom-en finished strong on the second day of the Allstate Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate Championship in New Orleans, climb-ing to fifth in the tournament stand-
ings, eight strokes back of first-place 
Southern California.
“I have to stay that I’m very pleased 
with the toughness of this team to-day,” coach Jan Dowling said. “We didn’t start off our best [Monday] and the weather was terrible. It was windy, cold and rainy and they hung tough and kept themselves mentally tough.”
Despite the slow start, UF made a 
climb up the leaderboard thanks to a solid round from freshman Camilla Hedberg, the Southeastern Conference Golfer of the Week.
Hedberg shot 6-over on the back 
nine in the opening round, and stum-bled out of the gate Monday, bogeying two of her first five holes. However, she rebounded on the back nine to shoot a 3-under 69 to sit in a tie for seventh in-dividually.
Senior Evan Jensen joined Hed-
berg under par with a 1-under 71 after 
shooting 5-over Sunday.
“We’ll continue to do the things 
we’ve been working on,” Dowling 
said. “We’re in contention to win, and that’s why we came here.” Vogel, UF men lead after Day 
1; women eight strokes back
Diep
“We’re in contention to win, 
and that’s why we came here.”
