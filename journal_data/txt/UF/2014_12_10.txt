All Thomas Coady wanted was 
a motorcycle.
When he ﬁ  rst asked his mother, 
Maria Coady, and his stepfather, 
Thomas Bedard, about a year ago, 
they immediately said no.
“No mother wants her kid to 
ride a motorcycle,” she said.
Thomas’ biological father had just passed away. He was 21, had 
his own money and insisted, so 
Maria caved.
She bought everything she 
could to keep him safe: a jacket 
with spine protectors, motorcy-
cle boots and the best helmet she could ﬁ  nd — the one Thomas was 
wearing the night he collided with 
Tolar Powell’s pick-up truck at the intersection of Northwest 34th Av-
enue and Northwest Eighth Ave-nue while 22-year-old Halie Guelﬁ   
rode on the back.
Despite both Thomas’ and 
Halie’s protection, the two UF stu-dents died from the injuries they 
sustained from Friday’s crash.
“I loved that child more than 
anything,” Maria said of her son. “He was the light of my life. He 
was the pulse that ran through my veins. There was just so much life 
in him.”■   ■   ■
Growing up, Maria said Thom-
as was shy and selﬂ  ess. She said he never asked for much.
“He was a little socially awk-
ward, but wonderfully bright,” the 
UF education associate professor said.
He liked Rubik’s Cubes and 
video games, and Maria said he started reading when he was 3 
years old.His younger sister, Rachel, is 19. 
She goes to Santa Fe College and 
said Thomas was her best friend.
He loved biology. His child-
hood room at his parent’s house 
is ﬁ  lled with books on global 
health. There’s a molecular struc-ture hanging from his ceiling and 
mathematical equations written on 
pieces of paper.Grieving mother reﬂ  ects on son’s selﬂ  essness, passion

Next semester, don’t be surprised to see Kent Fuchs 
on the way to class.
The president of a university should be visible, he 
said. That is the most exciting part.
The ﬁ  ve-month search for the 12th president of The 
Gator Nation ended in October, selecting Fuchs as Pres-
ident Bernie Machen’s successor. The former Cornell University provost’s term will ofﬁ  cially begin Jan. 1, and he will settle into the president’s ofﬁ  ce a day later.
“I’ll be out walking around campus, meeting people 
and talking to them, learning from them,” Fuchs said.
He has visited UF twice in the six weeks leading up 
to his term to learn about the campus and begin con-necting with the UF community.
“As president, one of the most important roles is 
serving as the spokesman and being the public repre-sentative of the university,” he said. “It’s really impor-tant to enhance the reputation of the university to be-come visible nationwide.”
And among the most important relationships to 
build are with students, he said.
Both the president and students have time con-Proﬁ  le: What does

Gainesville Police is urging students and 
residents to secure their belongings and take 
precautions before leaving town for the holi-days.
Those who are traveling should lock all doors and close blinds and curtains so po-
tential thieves can’t see inside homes, GPD 
spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. 
Students should also avoid posting when 
they’re leaving Gainesville on social media, he said, and mail should be halted or delivered to a different address for anyone leaving home for extended periods of time.
“Trust your neighbors,” Tobias said. 
“Sometimes your neighbors are going to be people that you can reach out to to keep an eye on your house.”
If you return home to a burglary, Tobias 
said to call 911 immediately and refrain from searching your home until ofﬁ  cers respond. 
Students should set their thermostat heat 
setting to 60 degrees or less, wrote Amy Campus, efﬁ  ciency program coordinator at 
Gainesville Regional Utilities, in an email. She 
also suggested turning off the electricity and water that electric water heaters utilize.
Students should also unplug appliances 
like cable boxes, TVs, microwaves and char-gers, Campus said.
“It takes a lot less energy to reset all the 
clocks and settings than to allow them to run for 2-3 weeks when you are gone,” she said.GPD AND GRU: Protect belongings, save energy during break

He hopes to be active on social media, connect with students
straints, and there’s not much oppor-
tunity for him to be in a classroom or laboratory. Coming from another university, interaction is even more essential for him.
“You can learn from students 
about issues they’re facing, things that they would like to improve on or change, things that they’re re-ally happy and proud about,” Fuchs said. “By being engaged and visible, I will have the opportunity to learn from them.”
He said he hopes to become an ac-
tive presence on social media and be physically present at events around campus and in the community. He 
is also going to look into writing a 
column in the Alligator.
UF Student Body President Cory 
Yeffet said he is excited student vis-ibility is one of Fuchs’s top priorities as he begins his term.
“Dr. Fuchs appreciates the diver-sity and uniqueness of our student body and I am looking forward to him getting the chance to meet and learn about our students,” Yef-fet wrote in an email. “He wants to work together with the student 
body to achieve the goal of becom-
ing a top 10 public institution.”
To do so, Fuchs said it is impor-
tant to convey a positive tone and set of aspirations.
“Students want to be a part of a 
university that has great aspirations for the future so they can be even more proud of it after they graduate 
than they are now,” he said. “And 
it’s important they know it’s one of the best in the world.”
When Fuchs was growing up, he 
saw himself working at an engineer-ing firm. But after graduating from Duke University with a bachelor’s degree in engineering, he decided he wanted to be around students in 
some way.
He earned a master’s in divinity 
from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School to become 
a pastor. Before becoming or-
dained though, he switched gears to be in a univer-sity environment and attended graduate school 
at the University of Illinois, earning master’s and doctorate degrees in 
electrical engineering.
He said he became more people-
focused as a result of these experi-
ences, which proved beneficial as he moved into different leadership roles.
Fuchs began his academic career 
as a faculty member at the Univer-sity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
before moving on to Purdue Univer-
sity. In 2002, he became the dean of engineering at Cornell University and then was elected provost in Jan-uary 2009.
One of his most significant mo-
ments as Cornell provost was work-ing during the economic downturn of 2008, he said. He learned to help build excellence and academic stat-ure despite constrained resources. It was a good lesson to learn, he said, as you’re not going to have all the 
resources.
He learned to be open to unex-
pected opportunities when he took 
the chance to create a new 12-acre Cornell campus in New York City.
Fuchs also led the ivy’s diversity 
initiative, focusing not only on cre-ating a diverse Student Body and faculty, but also their achievement 
and engagement. There’s not just 
one office for diversity.  Each leader is accountable for implementing and measuring success and diversity.
Nearing the end of six years as 
provost, Fuchs said he was thinking about where he wanted to be in the last phase of his academic career. UF was attractive due to its similarities 
as a land-grant university, as well as 
its differences in scale and broad op-portunities.“Every time I learned something 
more about the university, it became more clear to me that this was an amazing university,” he said.
He and his wife, Linda, are look-
ing forward to becoming a part of 
the Gainesville community and The 
Gator Nation, where everyone has been welcoming, encouraging and receptive. The new 5,000-square-foot president’s house on Village Drive isn’t quite finished, so they will find temporary housing in the meantime.
Although he won’t have much 
free time, he said he wants to be involved in Gainesville’s religious community and attend churches, synagogues and other religious events.
Fuchs said he’ll take the first six 
months to create goals for the next 10 years. He is a proponent of goals that can be measured, and he said 
UF Rising is one of the university’s 
most exciting and attractive attri-butes.

President Bernie Machen is leaving behind an 11-year lega-
cy that has expanded the university and set UF on the path to 
preeminence.
During his presidency, Machen has overseen times of 
growth for the university. 
Under his leadership, UF received preeminence status from 
the Florida Legislature in 2013, which created jobs for more than 60 faculty members and raised nearly $1 billion commit-
ted to the preeminence plan.
Machen said the university’s success is due to the dedica-
tion of the UF community. 
“I think we have the best students of any university I have 
ever been at,” he said. “Especially undergraduates, and I just 
hope that they live up to their potential.”
Machen oversees more than 50,000 students, 3,238 of which belong to a program close to his heart. 
The Machen Florida Opportunity Schol-
ars Program pays tuition, room and board for students in financial need.
“These are young people that wouldn’t 
be here,” he said. “They get in on their own, that’s what’s amazing to me. Many of them 
have been homeless, have worked three jobs, their parents don’t speak English. They 
really are a special group of people.”
In November, the UF Foundation began fundraising $100 
million for the program. 
Throughout his 45-year career in academia, Machen has 
served as a president of a public university for 17 years, and six 
of those years were spent at the University of Utah.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said Machen was a dean at 
the University of Michigan for eight years when he was hired to be interim provost.“He just kind of got plucked from the faculty to being in-
terim,” she said.
Since Machen became president in 2004, the university has 
undergone various changes on a quest to become a top-10 pub-lic university.
Among his achievements at UF, Machen was at the fore-
front of developing the 40-acre Innovation Square and creating the Innovation Hub technology incubator. 
Jose Miranda, a 22-year-old UF alumnus with a degree in 
political science, said Machen will be remembered as being a president of the university during a very important time in its history.
Miranda benefitted from the Machen Florida Opportunity 
Scholars Program. 
“I think Bernie Machen’s legacy will be one of growth and 
opportunities,” he said. “Both at the whole university level and for the individual students that he impacted directly or indi-rectly.”Outgoing UF president looks back at 11-year experience

When the 22-year-old wasn’t working 
toward his degree in biology, Maria said he 
loved to travel. His family lived in Southern 
France for a year, and last summer, after 
Thomas’ dad died, he traveled to his father’s family farm in Ireland to bury his ashes.
He planned to graduate from UF — his 
dream school — in the Spring. Though Ma-
ria encouraged Thomas to tour other college 
campuses, his heart was set here.
“He was where he wanted to be, doing 
what he wanted to do and surrounded by people who loved him,” she said.
Maria reflected on one time, not too long 
ago, when she and Bedard were at the beach 
with Thomas. Her son was worried about 
the growing global Ebola epidemic and kept 
saying, “I gotta go. I gotta help someone.”
Thomas worked in blueberry fields, Ma-
ria said, and was an advocate for migrant workers. After graduation, he considered 
joining the Peace Corps.
“He wasn’t in the medical field for the 
money,” Maria said. “He was in it because 
he knew he could make a difference and re-
ally help people.”
■   ■   ■
Before heading out on his bike, Thomas 
and Halie played chess. Maria said Halie beat him, according to friends, and the two 
were probably on their way to grab a bite to eat around 7 p.m. when they entered the in-tersection.
About four hours later, there was a knock 
on Maria’s door. It was a police officer. Thomas was in an accident, the officer said as he clutched a picture of her son’s driver’s license.
Maria and Bedard ran back inside, 
changed their clothes and headed to UF Health Shands Hospital, where doctors, neurosurgeons, nurses and social workers surrounded them with bad news.
Thomas slipped into cardiac arrest when 
he got to the trauma center. And when he was in the operating room, it happened again. Once he was stabilized, doctors gave 
him a CAT scan, but his brain was dead. 
There was no brain activity.
Maria signed a do not resuscitate form 
around midnight. She said there was no question.
■   ■   ■
A few weeks ago, Thomas surprised Ma-
ria with tickets to the UF versus University of Kentucky home football game. Maria met 
some of his friends, and together they tail-
gated. The two ate turkey legs and pizza. It was cold out, and Maria bought him a new Gators sweatshirt.
She wore it for days after he died.
“The best thing I’ve ever done in my life 
was have Thomas,” she said. “Our heart-
strings were connected. He was my love.”
Four days before the accident, Thomas 
went to Maria’s house to celebrate her birth-day.
Before he left, she gave him a big hug, a 
big kiss and told him, “I miss you already.”
Then he drove away on his bike.
Thomas was a careful driver, she said, 
and that night was the last time she saw him 
alive.
Struggling to fight through her tears, she 
said, “I don’t know how I’m going to wake 
up every day for the rest of my life and not 
have him here.”
■   ■   ■
When Maria said goodbye to her only 
son, Thomas was covered in bruises and tubes. The life support machines were off.
When she touched him, she said his skin 
was already growing cold. So she laid on top 
of him, wrapped her arms around him one 
last time and kissed him all over as his heart-beat slowed to a stop. With a pair of scissors, 
she then cut off a piece of his hair.
“I will love you forever,” she said.There will be a service for Thomas at the 
Greenhouse Church, 2925 NW 39th Ave., 
from 3 to 5 p.m. Thursday. UF is also host-ing a ceremony at 11 a.m. Friday at the Presi-dent’s Home.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 2014

Gainesville’s 24-hour Winn-
Dixie will begin shutting its doors 
each day starting this Saturday. 
The grocery store — located at 
2002 SW 34th St. off of 20th Av-enue — will no longer be open all day. Instead, customers will have 
to shop for groceries between the hours of 7 a.m. and midnight. 
Though a store manager con-
firmed the hours change Tuesday 
night, Winn-Dixie’s corporate contact was not available for comment. 
“That really sucks,” said Val-
eria Morell, a 20-year old biologi-cal sciences sophomore. “I didn’t know they were doing that.”Morell and her girlfriend, An-
drea Faria, a 20-year-old electrical 
engineering junior, shop at Winn-
Dixie often and make the occa-sional late-night run for necessi-ties like Nutella and ice cream. 
“We really wanted to have 
Nutella screwballs at two in the morning,” Faria said about one impromptu trip. 
But for other students, like 
Cassidy Minnick, an 18-year-old nursing freshman, the change won’t really affect them. The Winn Dixie location is on 
Minnick’s bus route home, so she 
does her shopping after class. 
Winn Dixie will close at 9 p.m. 
on Christmas Eve and remain 
closed until 7 a.m. on Dec. 26 for 
the holidays. It will also close 
early at 10 p.m. on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. Winn-Dixie to stop being a 24-hour grocery store option

Tacky sweaters and Santa cos-
tumes donned by UF student sena-
tors signaled the beginning of the holiday season, but seven students suited up to talk politics.
After weeks of silently observ-
ing senators in their natural habitat, students from UF’s Problems of De-mocracy class were inspired to sign up for public debate Tuesday night to deliver speeches highlighting concerns with UF Student Govern-ment, citing a lack of voter participa-tion and student representation.
“Online voting is a simple way 
to increase participation,” suggest-ed former student senator Rodolfo Pérez, a 29-year-old political science and international relations senior. “It would allow students to vote on their own time when they are not stressed out between classes.”
Lauren Smith, 19, advocated 
for incentives such as discounts to 
Study Edge and Starbucks for stu-
dents who vote in SG elections to drive students to the polls.
“The UF Senate will have sena-
tors who the student population, as a whole, will have a better under-standing of, increasing the level of trust and support between the stu-dent body and Senate,” the UF po-
litical science junior said.
David Ponoroff, 19, capped the 
students’ grievances with one final 
message to senators.
“Your positions are more than a 
privilege. They are a responsibility,” the UF political science sophomore said.
Some senators shifted in their 
seats in the midst of an unexpect-edly uncomfortable atmosphere.
“I’m glad students were taking 
an interest in Senate by voicing their opinions,” said UF Student Senate President Joseph Michaels.Poli sci students visit SG,

Every year, one-third of college students are award-
ed grants that give them the chance to earn their de-grees. This is made possible by the Federal Pell Grant Program, a need-based system that provides funding to 
low- and middle-income students. This program is cru-
cial for giving hardworking young people the ability to pursue higher education and follow their career paths, and it strengthens our nation’s commitment to making education a priority.
Unfortunately, under proposals by Democratic Sen.
Tom Harkin, Congress could take more than $300 mil-lion from the program’s surplus and use it to increase the revenue of student loan companies. Astonishingly, 
this bill is meant to encourage companies to stop mis-
treating their student borrowers.
 Instead of protecting the ﬁ  nancial security of the Pell 
Grant Program, the U.S. Department of Education will give student loan companies millions of extra dollars 
as an incentive to help borrowers manage their debts. 
In other words, they are getting paid more money to simply do their jobs and not take advantage of their cus-tomers.
It is inexcusable to take money set aside for hopeful 
college students and offer it to student loan companies that have a history of cheating the system and unethical-ly raising prices. Student advocates, consumer groups and colleges across the country have consistently com-
plained about the way these companies intentionally 
mislead borrowers for the sake of proﬁ  t.
Navient, one of the corporations that will receive 
higher payments from the proposal, recently paid a 
massive federal ﬁ  ne for allegedly charging tens of thou-
sands of active-duty troops unfair late fees. According to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, 93 percent of the troops “paid much more than they should have.”
If the current student loan 
contractors cannot be trusted to honor legal and ethical obliga-tions, in what universe do they deserve increased proﬁ  ts from 
the government?
As Sen. Elizabeth Warren 
explained during a September 
hearing: “I do not understand a 
basic renegotiation that says you can continue breaking 
the law, but we’re going to pay you more money for 
doing it.”
With college tuition rising faster than the rate of in-
ﬂ  ation, the U.S. Department of Education has a respon-
sibility to serve the best interests of students and help 
them overcome these increasingly difﬁ  cult obstacles. According to the Project on Student Debt, nearly 70 per-cent of graduating seniors had loans to repay. The loans averaged an astounding $29,000 per student last year. 
Thankfully, the Pell Grant Program helps keep the cost 
of these loans bearable. Without the program, millions of more students would be facing massive amounts of debt.
The Congressional Budget Ofﬁ  ce predicts that the 
Pell Grant Program’s surplus will turn into a deﬁ  cit as soon as 2017. Lawmakers should do everything they can to support this much-needed program, which launches so many students into becoming promising young pro-
fessionals. Pell Grant money needs to be saved for the 
millions of college students who need it, not placed in the hands of corporations that thrive off of student loan debt in the ﬁ  rst place.

thank you to our 
readers
Well, this is it. 
This community, including UF, Santa Fe Col-
lege and Gainesville as a whole, has been through 
a lot this semester. We’ve had the highs and lows we’d ex-pect and those we just couldn’t see coming.
This semester, we at the Alligator faced the breaking 
news on all fronts: a sexual predator on the loose, Ebola 
scares in the U.S., the shooting at Florida State University, 
a new president and football coach and the recent protests after deaths of black men at the hands of white cops who were never indicted.
And the reason we stay up at all hours of the night chas-
ing stories, the reason why we scramble to get the facts to put in print the next day, is for you. 
You, the reader, are why this newspaper gives us op-
portunities to not only serve you but also grow our careers. 
Every night, Sunday through Thursday, nearly 40 of us 
work tirelessly to produce a paper that we ﬁ  nd pride in. For some of us, this newspaper is everything. This old, vine-covered frat house on West University Avenue squished between old storefronts is a home away from home. We 
have meals here, spare clothes here, frantically study here, 
and we spend so much time here for you. 
Without an audience, we wouldn’t have a paper.So this is a thank you from us to you: Thank you for 
reading our stories. Thank you for calling in story ideas. Thank you for writing for us, and thank you for comment-ing and sharing our stories online — even if it wasn’t al-ways to praise us. 
 The face of journalism is changing, and we are trying 
our best to keep up. One thing is consistent, though: Noth-ing beats good storytelling.
Our newsroom is run solely by students. We don’t have 
an outside supervisor, and we don’t have an adult in the 
ﬁ  eld telling us what our next step should be. What we do 
have is a collective of experiences and opinions that pro-pels us forward. And the only way we can keep this news-paper up is if we know what you want. 
Within the ﬂ  ux of changing mediums is the ﬂ  ux of 
changing writers. Each semester begins with a new team of journalists with different ideas and goals. Some may see this as a weakness because it looks like a lack of consis-tency, but we see it as an advantage. Every semester, we 
try to bring better things to the table. And every semester, 
we do.
We wish you a very enjoyable and safe holiday, and we 
can’t wait to serve you again in 2015.WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 2014

8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 2014
One thing my parents always taught me was to 
stop, take a step back and look over my work. 
To them, it was probably an inconsequential 
phrase they would repeat to me as a 4-year-old learning 
how to tie my shoes, or in middle school, when I started to struggle with algebra, or even in high school, when I was writing my college essays.
But to me, it’s become my mantra. Take a step back. 
Breathe. Check over everything I’ve done and contin-
ue.
If you sought out the heart of my motivation, you’d 
ﬁ  nd that the reason I’ve spent some part of every day 
this year at the Alligator, thinking about the Alligator, 
writing or editing for the Alligator is because I knew it was a stepping stone to my next journalistic endeavor. 
I thought: Every journo starts out at a student news-
paper and then moves onto internships and, ﬁ  nally, 
jobs. Working at the Alligator was purely an act of lo-
gistics.
Who would have thought that I would have some of 
my best college experiences — some of the best experi-
ences of my life — in this shitty, renovated frat house 
with a leaky roof and the worst Internet problems in North Central Florida?
Who would have thought that I would voluntarily 
eat most of my meals here, nap here, become inspired 
with my most creative ideas in a place we share with 
two old, rattling vending machines and the occasional rat?
And who would have thought that I would ﬁ  nd some 
of my favorite people while sitting on the stained gray carpet in the editor-in-chief’s ofﬁ  ce, eating spaghetti and meatballs from Leonardo’s, people who would hug me when I got the ﬂ  u the same day I was rejected from my dream internship, people who would go for walks 
with me and my dog?
I know it’s all so cliche, but I’m nostalgic today.
When I stop and look over this year, I remember start-
ing out in January at the lowest-paid position, thinking 
I wasn’t going to make it because I wasn’t good enough, 
that the students around me were all so much better and more conﬁ  dent than I was. 
And I was right: They were better and because of 
that, they were more conﬁ  dent. But the one thing that 
will always stand out to me is how impressed they were 
by hard work, and I thought, “I can do that.”During the Summer, the 
constant ﬂ  ux and ﬂ  ow of sharp writers and supportive editors 
only proved to me the impor-
tance of the family we create for ourselves during this point in our lives. 
Some girls have their so-
rorities full of best friends and 
memories; I have our newsroom with its creaking chairs and rickety desks, every bump and groan of the ﬂ  oor, a different story, a different laugh.
This semester, my most mentally and emotionally ex-
hausting so far, will always be my semester of sharing: sharing pug photos on Instagram, sharing complaints over coffee, sharing hugs in the parking lot, sharing 
gossip in the parking lot of Taco Bell.
What I thought would be a minor job at just a college 
newspaper — a stepping stone if you will — turned out 
to be an entirely new route, a path I never knew that I could take. 
Of course I got the stories I need for my portfolio I 
thought would only be important in getting me to the next destination.
But these stories opened me up to new facets not only 
of the world I had never understood before, but also of my colleagues, my friends, whom I can trust to help me with my problems and make things better, even if it’s just a little bit.
When I stop, take a step back and look over this 
year, I’m so proud. I’m proud of our newsroom because we continue to produce a newspaper every day, even though the interest in journalism has plummeted. I’m proud of the clever, articulate writers and thorough, in-
telligent editors who have come and gone on to better 
things.
And I’m proud of our family for making it through 
the ups and downs of running a newsroom without kill-ing each other.
Who knows what my next step is, and who really 
knows what yours is either? 
But the one piece of advice I can pass on is this: Take 
a break, breathe, reﬂ  ect over what you’ve done and 
move on.

opinions@alligator.org Monday marked the 34th  anniversary of John 
Lennon’s murder. Each year, it’s a somber day on the calendar and a reminder that even the 
biggest among us can be ripped away. I found myself listening to a Lennon-protest song — “Happy Xmas” — 
and I considered the year that was 2014. By all measures, 
2014 was a lousy experience for the world, and if you were to conduct a poll, 2014 might top a list of worst years in recent memory. 
The holidays are a time for 
celebration, family and hap-piness, but the overwhelming stench of 2014 still ﬁ  lls our noses with its putrid scent. 
Regardless of your politi-
cal afﬁ  liation, most of us can agree that we are glad to see 2014 move ﬁ  rmly into the past, and we are all hopeful that 2015 will bring our community, country and world a little more stability than it found in 2014.
The year that was shook us to the very core as hu-
manity dealt with war across multiple continents, a 
plague spreading through West Africa, the crumbling of 
our institutions in the U.S. and a collective thought that the world and society are on the brink of total collapse. 
Perhaps the retrospective atmosphere of the holidays 
allows us to reﬂ  ect on 2014 and make whatever changes we can to better our community and world. Individual-ly, we may not have the ability to end war in the Middle East, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, or even restore trust in those who are supposed to serve and protect us, 
but we can pledge to make a small difference in 2015. 
What seems to be missing from our modern society is 
our collective will to help one another. Our sense of com-
munity seems to be disappearing along with our trust in the institutions that at one time were the glue that held together our society. If we are to ever pull ourselves out of the collective rut, then it behooves us to look inward, make incremental changes in our own lives and do what we can to spread that behavior. 
It sounds like hippie rhetoric, but maybe that’s what 
we need during our prolonged, collective depression. We can’t dose the entire developed world with Prozac, but if we each take small steps in the right direction, per-haps we can right humanity’s ship. We may disagree, ﬁ  ght and even go to war with one another, but all 7-plus billion of us are riding around the solar system on the same planet. 
Humanity’s patience is thin right now, but a little in-
trospective thought might do us all some good. We can continue raising our temperatures to the boiling point, but in the end, we help no one, ourselves included. Love him or hate him, John Lennon’s words of wisdom ring true today, and when times are tough, I often wonder what he would say if he were still alive.
Would Lennon march along with the protesters over 
the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases? Almost cer-tainly. Would Lennon protest the never-ending conﬂ  ict 
in the Middle East? He protested Vietnam, so why not 
Iraq and Afghanistan? Would Lennon ask us to ﬁ  nd an-other, more peaceful way to interact with each other and the world at large? I sure hope so. 
It’s easy to idealize Lennon and his beliefs, but each 
and every Dec. 8, I consider what the world lost on that day in 1980, and I long for Lennon’s words and songs of wisdom. We may never achieve Lennon’s naive vision of “Imagine,” but we can all work a little harder to make the world a better place. 
It may sound ridiculous, but if we don’t stand up, do 
the right thing and attempt to change the attitudes of 
those around us, we’ll fail to live up to Lennon’s ideal-
ized future and doom future generations. Start small in 2015 with an act of kindness and maybe, just maybe, it will lead others to do the same.
Happy holidays to all and may the new year bring us 
more opportunity, happiness and peace than 2014.

Santa Fe College administration an-
nounced Friday it would no longer offer 
job employment to Student Government leaders. Though the eight leaders still in ofﬁ  ce will receive wages until the close of 
Spring semester, the college immediately 
stopped paying the organization’s student directors last week.
Leadership members like the Student 
Senate president and Student Body presi-dent get paid to fulﬁ  ll administrative du-ties, according to Vice President of Student Affairs Naima Brown.
But the college decided to stop paying 
leaders because of blurred lines between attending to SG issues and carrying out job responsibilities.
Before this decision, each year’s SG 
leaders were offered job opportunities as educational aides, in which they worked 10 hours a week at minimum wage.
Current leadership members will con-
tinue to work through Spring semester 
because they were promised employment 
upon taking ofﬁ  ce, said programming ﬁ  -nance Chairman Austin Moody, one of the eight current leaders.
Brown said SG directors were immedi-
ately denied pay following Friday’s deci-sion because, under college rules, students — including SG leaders — are not allowed to hire on behalf of the college.
“Students were hiring people for the 
college, which isn’t right,” Moody said.
Next semester, Moody and his col-
leagues will work under supervisors, whom the college will assign. Leaders will no longer work in their ofﬁ  ces, which Brown said are reserved for SG duties.
Internal affairs director Benjamin My-
ers stopped getting paid Friday and said he felt the consequences immediately.
“Honestly, 80 bucks every two weeks 
— that’s grocery shopping, that’s gas money, that’s vital funds I need,” Myers said.
What made the pay cut frustrating for 
Myers, he said, is how unexpected it was. And he wasn’t the only one upset.
“If I’m upset about anything, I’m upset 
about the fact that they didn’t give anyone 
any notice and the timing of it,” said Sen. 
Connor Levine, 19.
Before it was announced during a busi-
ness meeting last Friday, Levine said he expected funds spending or pitches about spending accounts be discussed.
“But in reality, it was just them saying, 
‘You’re done here, we’re taking all your money, no one’s getting paid anymore,’” 
he said. “It wasn’t even a formal process, 
it was just like, ‘You guys can hold your positions,’ but it’s a joke now.”SFC to stop paying its SGLOCAL

This afternoon, supporters of Grace Mar-
ketplace will gather at the corners of Main 
Street intersections to remind passers-by, for one last time this year, to help fund the in-debted homeless shelter. 
The rally, which begins at 4:30 p.m. at the 
intersection of West University Avenue and Main Street, will put supporters at intersec-tions along Main Street with signs reading #FundGrace. 
The idea is that as drivers pass by, the rep-
etition of the signs will draw their attention, said Jon DeCarmine, operations director for the Alachua County Coalition for the Home-
less and Hungry. 
“There is still a huge amount of people 
who aren’t really sure what we are doing and 
how we are doing it, and we just want to re-mind people that we’re here and what we’re doing,” DeCarmine said.  
The rally will kick off the shelter’s 40-day 
Indiegogo fundraising campaign aimed at raising $50,000 to help improve services at 
Grace. 
“Now we have money to do the bare mini-
mum,” DeCarmine said. “We need some ﬂ  ex-
ibility to provide higher quality services.” 
The funds will go primarily toward ex-
panding Grace’s emergency shelter, which DeCarmine said is a key service.
The money will also be used for miscella-
neous expenses, which can include anything 
from buying basic toiletries to paying for 
someone’s security deposit so he or she may move into housing, he said. 
“We have had people who are working 
who make enough money to pay rent, but when you factor in ﬁ  rst month’s rent and last month’s rent and security deposits, then getting into housing makes that an unattain-
able goal,” DeCarmine said. “We are going 
to use this to make this an attainable goal for people.” 
The shelter has been struggling since it 
opened this summer with insufﬁ  cient funds and a $15,000 monthly deﬁ  cit. 
Community members like Pat Fitzpatrick 
are doing anything they can to keep the shel-ter aﬂ  oat. 
“It’s close to being as good a homeless 
shelter as you can get,” Fitzpatrick, 65, said. “They really came together, and I think we all just got to get together now.” 
Fitzpatrick is working on setting up a 
counseling group to help people quit smok-ing. The fee for counseling will be peanut 
butter and socks, with the donations going to 
Grace Marketplace. 
He plans to be at today’s rally. “We gotta do everything we can to sup-
port them,” Fitzpatrick said. “We’ve got to donate.”

Starbucks and on-campus ven-

lines of students hoping to re-ener-gize after pulling all-nighters. 
“We make sure we have more of 
everything in stock so that we don’t run out of anything,” said Shivani Desai, a 22-year-old UF biology 
graduate student and a Starbucks 
employee in the Hub.
Aramark marketing manager Jill 
Rodriguez said the busiest Starbucks location is at Library West.
“At Library West, we will see 
close to a 50% increase in custom-ers during finals week,” she wrote in an email. “We make sure we have plenty of staff scheduled to handle the extra traffic.”
The cold weather brings in more 
customers, and employees have been working additional hours, De-sai said.
“It’s busier,” Desai said, “a lot 
busier. Normally, I work about 20 to 25 (hours), but I’m trying to get 
at least 30 a week until finals week 
ends.”
Desai said the Hub location has 
had about two-thirds more custom-ers than usual.
“Our sales went up like crazy,” 
she said.

line Chavez, the coffee lines are a

Three UF students are tak-
ing a stand on mental illness 
by creating a nonprofit called 
Stronger than Stigma.
Gabrielle Magid, Harrison 
Cady and Allison Buenaga 
will host the organization’s 
first meeting Thursday, with 
the hopes of changing the way society views mental health is-
sues.
Magid, a UF women’s stud-
ies senior, created the group to 
shed light on mental disorders that impact college students.
“This is my passion,” the 
22-year-old said. “We saw a need in that community for a support network. This is re-
ally a movement for college 
students by college students.”
At the meeting, Magid and 
her fellow executive board members, Cady, Buenaga and 
Florida State University stu-
dent Skylar Warmund, will discuss the FSU shooting, Amanda Bynes and Robin 
Williams at UF Hillel starting 
at 6 p.m. 
The UF students founded 
the organization in 2013 to tackle student mental health 
head-on. 
Magid said she and the oth-
er board members deeply care 
about mental health issues and the way they are handled 
and viewed by society.
“We all have personal ties 
with the cause,” she said. “We 
all either have firsthand expe-
rience ourselves or because of 
a family member.”
One in four Americans 
struggle with mental illness, according to Stronger than 
Stigma. 
Buenaga, a UF sociology ju-
nior, plans on going to gradu-ate school to learn more about 
eating disorders, substance abuse issues and ways to help people who are afflicted.
“I want to be a mental 
health counselor and work in a rehabilitation center,”  the 21-year-old said. “I think it’s important to be able to talk 
about mental health issues. 
Communication and having a strong support system is an important part of treating 
mental illness.”
The group is looking to ex-
pand to other Florida univer-
sities.

where Skylar is a student,” Magid said. UF organization takes

About a dozen robots built by UF students will put 
their gears in motion today for UF robot demo day.
At the event, students in the Intelligent Machine De-
sign Laboratory class will show off the robots they have 
spent the entire semester building.  
The course is an elective for engineering majors that al-
lows students to combine electrical, mechanical and com-puter engineering to build a functional robot.Some robots are designed to climb stairs and move ob-
jects, while one robot is controlled by a student’s brain.
The demonstrations are free and open to the public and 
will be held in the New Engineering Building Harris Ro-tunda from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m.
Eric Schwartz, associate director of the Machine Intel-
ligence Lab, said although no awards are given for best robot, students gain a valuable experience.
 “It may not get them a prize, but it’ll get them a job,” 
Schwartz said.
He said students have the ability to be creative with their designs. All the building materials for the robots are provided in class.
“People work harder if they do something they’re ex-
cited about,” he said.
 Nick Cox, A 21-year-old teaching assistant for Intelli-
gent Machine Design Laboratory, said the demo day gives 
the students an opportunity to inspire other students to 
take the class.
“They get a chance to show off what they’ve done all 
semester,” the UF electrical engineering senior said.UF engineering students to demonstrate their robots todayCAmpuS WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15 14, ALLIGATOR § WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 2014

thank each and every one of you for reading our section every day.
You are the reason we write 
and why our staff stays in the of-
ﬁ  ce until midnight ﬁ  ve nights a 
week.
We’ve covered a lot this semes-
ter.
From everything surrounding 
the football team on and off the ﬁ  eld — the Treon Harris inves-tigation, the Georgia upset win, the LSU and South Carolina last-
second losses, the Will Muschamp 
ﬁ  ring, the Jim McElwain hiring among everything else — to the soccer and volleyball teams reach-ing their respective NCAA Tour-naments, we had our fair share of coverage to handle.
And I stand by everything we 
ran and the direction that our sec-
tion is heading.
We’ve shifted to a more fea-
ture-oriented section — running 
multiple long-form pieces on topics like Billy Horschel talking to the UF men’s golf team, a two-part series breaking down Mary Wise’s track record with volleyball recruiting and three proﬁ  les from 
the UF soccer team in addition to 
our football wraps  — while also blending in our daily coverage of 
UF athletics.
We wrote columns that covered 
all ends of the spectrum — from an 
in-depth comparison between the football and volley-ball teams to taking a stance on topics such as Leon Orr ditching the Gators, the FSU 
shooting, the Jameis 
Winston investiga-tion and much, much more.
We — all 18 of us 
who encompass the sports staff — worked tirelessly to make this paper the best it has been.
And we’re not ﬁ  nished just 
yet.
Just because we aren’t publish-
ing a physical paper over the next few weeks does not mean alliga-torSports is going to stop report-ing.
There will be too much going 
on to take a break.
With McElwain’s hiring and a 
bowl game against East Carolina set for Jan. 3, the football world in Gainesville is bound to have its share of news to report. Richard Johnson, Morgan Moriarty and I will have all those updates for you.
The men’s basketball team has 
a ﬁ  ve-game schedule set to last 
throughout the Winter break, 
starting Friday with Texas South-ern and ending with contests against Florida State on the road (Dec. 30) and UConn at home (Jan. 3). Erica Hernandez and Richard will have all the results, analysis and commentary.
The women’s basketball team 
plays seven games of its own dur-ing the three week period. That schedule for Amanda Butler and Co. begins tonight with a home game against Wisconsin and ends with its ﬁ  rst two Southeastern 
Conference games — 
games against LSU and Auburn. Graham Hall — our assistant editor to be — will have the coverage.
The volleyball team continues 
its road through the NCAA Tour-nament with aspirations to win its ﬁ  rst national title in 24 attempts 
under coach Mary Wise. Our out-
going assistant editor Eden Otero and incoming online editor Ian Cohen will keep you up to speed.
Throughout the break, we will also have updates and primers giving you all the need-to-know information regarding every sport that will ﬁ  ll our section this Spring.
And we will still strive to make 
our section the best that it can pos-sibly be.
So thanks for reading. I hope 
you continue to do so.
Semester ends, but alligatorSports will still be working

OTERO’S OPINION
Saying goodbye is always hard.
So hard in fact, that I lied in 
bed on my laptop Monday night 
searching my soul to ﬁ  nd a way to 
summarize the last year of my life in 
terms and emotions that people could 
actually understand.
I decided to do what I do best: tell 
a story.
My ﬁ  rst time at the Alligator was 
strange. I was new and had never been inside the building. It just seemed like a tangle of halls lined with dingy pan-eled wood. 
I wandered the halls for about ﬁ  ve 
minutes before someone — I honestly couldn’t say who — noticed me and led me to the sports ofﬁ  ce.
When I walked in, I was greeted 
by former editors Adam Lichtenstein and Landon Watnick. The sports ofﬁ  ce is about a 10-foot-by-8-foot room — it is literally like working in a very large 
closet. 
There are pictures everywhere, plas-
tered to walls, cork board desk sidings 
and cabinets. But the ﬁ  rst thing anyone notices when they see the ofﬁ  ce is our “Wall of Shame.” The coveted wall that holds all of our sports fumbles (of course this pun was intended, are you kidding me?).
Whenever a writer spells something 
wrong/gets a fact wrong, it goes on this wall. It’s not just there to remind us that we’re human and we mess up, but that you NEVER publish fact errors.
The carpet on the ﬂ  oor is stained, 
and honestly, the room typically smells like sweat and food.
But as I stood in that old tiny ofﬁ  ce 
waiting for our ﬁ  rst staff meeting of the semester, I felt at home. I knew this was a place where I would grow and learn – even if it was for only a 
short period 
of time. 
While it 
was home, I 
never actually expected to meet some of my closest friends in that ofﬁ  ce.
Jordan McPherson, the current 
sports editor for the Alligator, is one of those friends. When I met him I remem-
ber thinking that he looked so young 
(which he was. Jordan is only 20 years old, he just turned 19 when I met him). He’s tall with auburn hair and blue eyes that are magniﬁ  ed by glasses.
He has a look to him that tells you 
he’s going to be a famous sports writer one day and has a work ethic that will be the death of him if he doesn’t learn to 
slow down and enjoy life sometimes.
My ﬁ  rst time in that ofﬁ  ce was the 
ﬁ  rst time I really identiﬁ  ed as a serious 
journalist. It changed my entire per-spective and even my life.
At the beginning of the meeting, 
Adam told all of the beat writers – about 10 of us crammed into that closet of an ofﬁ  ce – to say our names, major 
and beat we were covering. When it 
was my turn to speak I was so nervous I didn’t know what to say. I stuttered out something like, “I’m Edennnnnnnnn. I’m covering lacrosse. Uh, yeah.”
It was the hardest introduction I 
ever made, because it was important.
The things I take from that little of-
ﬁ  ce will sit with me forever. I will never 
forget getting sick when everyone else 
was sick (because in news there is no such thing as a sick day), laughing so hard that I cried and even the times I had writers pull me aside and tell me that what Jordan and I were doing was making a difference.
I have friends that I’m leaving, but I 
will be snapchatting and texting them daily. 
If only I could express how incred-
ible Alligator managing editor Colleen Wright is and the amazing ability she possesses to write a story that makes me simultaneously cry while laughing. 
Or let you hear the deadpan dad 
jokes that Alligator online editor Bakr Saliq can make at the drop of a hat.
But when I think of the Alligator, I 
always go back to my ﬁ  rst time there. A time when I was still learning. Now, I leave the Alligator knowing I have learned and gained as much as I pos-sibly could. 
I walk away from this job with a 
heavy heart (I’m now speaking in cli-ches), but it’s not without knowing that everything I did, everything I made and every person I edited and advised was not without its beneﬁ  ts.
So here’s the part where I advise ev-
eryone that is focused on becoming a journalist to work at the Alligator. Not because I worked there, but because I 
found people who were just like me 
– people that think like me and have faced the same issues I’ve faced.
So here’s to the Alligator and all 
the amazing writers and people that I have met, the place that shaped me and made me who I am today, thank you for being here.
Thank you for making me a journal-
ist, and for giving me this chance, but most of all, thanks for the memories.

� IT HAPPENED IN A TWO-CAR CRASH.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Panthers quarterback Cam 
Newton suffered fractures to his lower back in a two-car 
crash Tuesday and will spend the night in the hospital, a 
team spokesman said Tuesday.
Newton was in fair condition, had no other internal 
injuries and would not need surgery, team spokesman Charlie Dayton said during a news conference outside 
a Charlotte hospital. It was unclear if Newton would be able to practice or play Sunday against the Buccaneers, Dayton said.
“Right now we have thought about Cam’s well-being 
and we understand there was someone else in the other car who was injured,” Dayton said. “We just hope that they’re all OK.”
He was expected to be released from the hospital on 
Wednesday after undergoing tests.
Television footage showed Newton on a stretcher be-
ing placed in an ambulance after the crash. Photos from The Charlotte Observer showed the 25-year-old smiling 
as an ofﬁ  cer attended to him on the ground.Panthers QB Cam

At the onset of 2014, the Florida football season was viewed with optimism. The Will Muschamp-led Gators, coming off an injury-plagued 4-8 year in 2013, were in the need of a turn-
around. The head coach’s job depended on it. But Florida finished th e year with a 6-5 record, and the plethora of mistakes that encompassed the season resulted in Muschamp’s job.
Here’s the timeline of the 2014 Florida Football team:

ordinator Kurt Roper, special teams coordinator Coleman Hutzler and offensive line coach Mike Summers are introduced at a press conference in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.Alligator File Photo
Right: Florida held its first of 
nine open practices on March 19, giving fans and media their first glimpse at what the Gators had to offer. The team looked incon -
sistent at best early on, with inef-ficiencies plaguing the Gators to start off the Spring.

Right: After a month of practices, 
the Gators showcased their work in the 2014 Orange & Blue Debut. The offense showcased its tempo, reeling off 111 plays between the two teams while the defense looked improved.

Left: If there was any sign of 
trouble for the Gators, it was when Florida lost at Alabama. While UF wasn’t expected to come out victorious, it still showcased the issues that would plague Florida for the rest of the season: an ineffi-cient offense. Jonathan Czupryn / Alligator Staff
Left:  Muschamp and three 
UF players -- Jeff Driskel, Dante Fowler Jr. and Vernon Hargreaves -- traveled to Hoover, Alabama, for the annual Southeastern Confer -
ence Media Days. UF addressed the media on the first day of the three-day event and expressed op-timism about the season. 
Rachel Crosby / Alligator Staff
Above: After the bye week that followed the loss to the Crimson 
Tide, the Gators traveled to Knoxville, Tennessee, and almost lost to the Volunteers for the first time since 2005. But with the Gators trailing 9-0 in the waning seconds of the third quarter, Muschamp inserted freshman quarterback Treon Harris into the lineup. Harris responded by leading UF to 10 unanswered points and the win. But in less than 36 hours, Harris went from star to suspect after being investigated for an alleged sexual assault on campus. The complain -
ant withdrew her complaint four days later.
 Kan Li / Alligator Staff
Above:- The LSU and Missouri games were possibly the lowest points of Muschamp’s career. The LSU loss came with just one missed pass to senior tight end Tevin Westbrook with less than two minutes left in the game. Florida’s loss to Missouri one week later showcased the anger that Florida fans felt toward Muschamp as the crowds chanted “fire Muschamp” in the last half of the game. Jan. 13

tor Jeremy Foley and UF found 
their successor for the Florida football program with the hiring of Colorado State head coach Jim McElwain. The 52-year-old McElwain epitomized Foley’s qualifications for the Gators’ next head football coach: He had a track record for offensive suc -
cess and was of high-character and integrity.

IAN COHEN
Alligator Writer @icohenb
Holly Pole knew her team 
could do it. They just needed to 
be reminded.
Following Florida’s Set 1 loss 
to Miami on Saturday, in which 
Florida couldn’t seem to put to-
gether a clean offensive posses-sion, Pole pulled her teammates to the side and told them what 
she already knew.
“We talked about when we 
were on the road at Kentucky, 
and we were in a similar situa-tion there,” Pole said. “We came 
back in the next two sets and we 
were just rolling after that. So we just said it’s the same thing.”
Just like its four-set victory 
against then-No. 15 Kentucky, Florida rebounded from a poor start versus Miami and controlled the rest of the match.
Florida’s biggest strength is 
its veteran leadership, consisting of back row seniors Pole, Taylor Unroe and captain Maddy Mon-serez, and the guidance they are able to provide.
“Give credit to the players,” 
coach Mary Wise said. “Obvious-ly Miami was on a roll, we were not ….The fact that we (rebound-ed) in the second set speaks to their character, to the senior lead-ership and to the experience of having been there.”
The team’s maturity is a large 
reason why the Gators have made it this far- two wins in the NCAA tournament and a Sweet 16 matchup with No. 9 seed Il-linois. But as much as Florida struggled in the first set against Miami, Illinois will prove to be an even bigger challenge.
UF and UI swapped film of 
their second round matches to scout each other before they go head-to-head on Friday.Illinois will look to exploit the 
same weaknesses that the Hur-ricanes managed to poke at last Saturday- UF’s poor blocking.
“I think if you saw us play in 
that match (against Miami) you would say be physical at the net,” Wise said. “We didn’t block par-ticularly well, and that’s some-thing that we will address and try to fine tune.”
At the same time, with only 
16 teams left in the field of play, Florida won’t be making many significant adjustments going forward. 
“At this point in time your not 
going to make major overhaul,” Wise said. “You’re just trying to maximize your strengths and minimize your weaknesses.”
Although Florida’s weak-
nesses were on full display early against Miami, Illinois is coming off of two shutouts in which they held its opponents to hitting per-centages of .090 and .204.
The Gators will also have to 
prepare for the Fighting Illini’s outside hitter Jocelynn Birks, who compiled 37 kills, 16 digs and four total blocks over the weekend. Birks also accounted for 40 of her team’s points.
“(She’s) one of the premiere 
outside hitters, not only in the Big 10 but in the country,” Wise said. “(Illinois) has all of the tools. It’s 
not surprising that they had the 
success that they had and we’ll 
have quite the challenge come 
Friday night.”

ZOOP’S SCOOP
JONATHAN CZUPRYN @jczupryn
I stand in the company of great-
ness. And it smells. 
Stains older than me are soaked 
into the roots of the shag green car-
pet. The tattered ceiling lets the tor-
rential Florida rain infect the wall’s 
wooden paneling with mold.
But encapsulated in the heart of 
all the decay and mildew is the Uni-versity of Florida’s history, sealed with ink and stamped by the names of true newsmen.
Towering stacks of newspapers 
litter the second ﬂ  oor of The Inde-
pendent Florida Alligator, which 
contributes to the overlying “old book smell” that lingers above all.
Although these issues lie dor-
mant in the dark corners of this old place, they are not dead. 
They bring life to this commu-
nity’s ﬁ  nest moments — the com-memorative edition of Florida’s 2006 
national championship contrasts a 
colorful orange-and-blue wrap with the rest of the room’s yellow hue.
They bring life to this communi-
ty’s lowest moments — a box tucked away in the corner is 
marked, “ROLLING, 
if you don’t know who this is, don’t throw away.”
Inside remain the 
original notes and court orders from the Danny Rolling trial of 1994, including the guilty 
verdict that eventually 
sent the murderer to death row.
But with each day The Alligator 
goes into print, those newspapers lose a piece of their relevance. In this Twitter-centered news world, yesterday’s stories are history. Last year’s are ancient.
So, in the museum that is the 
second ﬂ  oor of The Alligator, I ac-cepted my place in this newspaper’s history. I am no longer the bright fu-ture of this organization but rather a relic of the past.
But as part of The Alligator’s 
newest class of alumni, I am proud of the work I contributed. I am anx-ious for the future I have ahead. And 
I am humbled knowing I have stood 
in the company of greatness and served my part.
My ﬁ  rst glimpse in-
side the ivy-clad walls of The Alligator came when I was 16. I en-rolled in the University of Florida’s Summer Journalism Institute prior to my senior year of high school in order 
to gauge my budding 
interest in reporting.
Although ﬁ  ve days of work-
shops and exercises prepared me for 
the education I had ahead of me, my group’s visit to The Alligator gave me my ﬁ  rst real look at a newsroom. I was hooked.
A little more than a year later, I 
found myself back in The Alligator as its newest applicant. With a tie wrung around my neck and a port-folio of my “clips” in hand, I ner-vously sat down for my interview with sports editor Tom Green and assistant sports editor Matt Watts.
They each sported beards while 
my peach fuzz was just starting to 
grow in. I still don’t know why they 
took a chance on a kid like me, but I’m glad they did.
My ﬁ  rst “thank you” of this col-
umn goes out to Tom and Matt. When my byline ﬁ  rst appeared in The Alligator on Sept. 12, 2011, I hardly recognized my own work. Tom and Matt each took an ax to my story and I was left questioning my future in journalism.
But due to their severe edits, I 
learned how to write, how to report and how to make my audience care about Florida’s cross country team.
To the more recent staff of The 
Alligator, thank you for letting me grow into the writer I am today.
Phil Heilman, you gave me my 
ﬁ  rst big beat and hooked me up with a gig for The Palm Beach Post. 
Adam Lichtenstein, you gave me 
my ﬁ  rst editor position and showed me the ropes to running this place.
And to Richard Johnson, Morgan 
Moriarty, Jordan McPherson and Eden Otero, thank you for giving me one hell of a ﬁ  nal semester at this place. It has been an honor working beside each of you and I can’t wait to 
see what you guys will continue to 
do in the ﬁ  eld of journalism.The Alligator is far from perfect. 
But the beauty of this paper doesn’t solely lie in its success, although it’s had its fair share of it in the past.
No, The Alligator derives its 
greatness from its ability to adapt.
When the University of Florida 
stiﬂ  ed the paper’s duty to inform the public, The Alligator declared its independence to maintain its jour-
nalistic integrity.
When the Internet threatened 
to abolish the campus’ newspaper 
presence, The Alligator created a website, app and online presence to keep up with journalism’s ever changing landscape.
And when the economy caught 
up with The Alligator’s antiquated 
newspaper business, the staff stood 
tall to ensure the University of Flori-da would still have a news source it could count on.
Today, I stand in the company of 
greatness for the ﬁ  nal time. So my ﬁ  nal “thank you” goes to The Inde-pendent Florida Alligator.
You have given me a lifetime of 
memories. Thank you and goodbye.
After four years and 297 bylines, Alligator lifer says farewell

GRAHAM HALL
Alligator Writer @Graham311
 There aren’t many girls taller than 6-foot.
Despite the recruiting prowess of coach 
Amanda Butler, and the facilities at the team’s disposal, the Florida women’s basketball team lacked a true post player last season. 
Redshirt senior Kayla Lewis and Ronni 
Williams were the lone six footers on the team and were subsequently required to de-fend the opponent’s tallest player.
That’s no longer the case this season.Along with the years-in-the-making re-
turn of redshirt junior Viktorija Dimaite, the Gators’ length was bolstered by the commit-ments of freshmen Brooke Copeland and Ha-ley Lorenzen. 
Copeland, who stands 6-foot-2 in her blue 
and white Nikes, can play anywhere on the court, and has a uniquely confident three-point shot for a post player. 
Lorenzen has filled the post well through-
out the team’s first eight games, using a large 6-foot-3 frame to out muscle and wear down the opposition. 
The duo have added a post presence to 
a team that has been sorely missed in previ-ous years, and Florida’s offensive style has evolved to include the ability to throw the ball down low to the post players. 
And while the pair have found a new home at Florida, things could have gone much differently.
Badger FamiliarityThe Gators play Wisconsin tonight at 7, a 
team Haley Lorenzen is all too familiar with. Hailing from Iowa City, Iowa, Lorenzen’s family also shared a love for all things Bad-ger. 
Her stepmother, Barbe Franke, was the Badgers’ all-time leading scorer with 1,994 points until her record was broken in 2008, and Lorenzen was able to learn a lot from the Wisconsin great.
“She taught me a lot of things, she coached 
my AAU program,” Lorenzen said. “We got really close through that.”
Arguably the best player coming out of 
Iowa last year, Lorenzen looked at Wiscon-sin, before deciding that wasn’t where she wanted to go. 
However, the choice was hers and hers 
alone, with Florida just seeming like a better fit.
Freshmen bring height, depth to short Gators rosterERICA A. HERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer @EricaAlyssa
With seven dunks from four players, Florida played true to 
its identity against Yale. 
Donovan defined that identity that the Gators (4-4) demon-
strated in their blowout 85-47 win against the Bulldogs (8-3) 
on Monday as a strong offense with good ball movement and 
different hustle plays. 
But that identity has not always been lived up to this sea-
son. 
“I call it like it is, I’m not so sure that we came in with a 
real high level of humility into this season, without playing 
any games,” Donovan said after Monday’s win. “…and I think because our schedule has been really really challenging here, up until the beginning of December, we’ve got a dose of the truth. We’ve been forced to have to deal with and confront the 
truth”
Against Yale, humility wasn’t so much on display as Flori-
da’s raw talent was. 
A major contribution to that raw talent was Florida’s young 
roster.
In the wake of the loss of the Gators’ 2014 graduating class, 
young additions to the roster and returning underclassmen 
have stepped up to the plate.
Chris Walker contributed three of Florida’s seven dunks 
against Yale. The 6-foot-10 sophomore forward shot 60 percent from the field and contributed 13 points in 21 minutes.
“It was a much needed win. I think it’s coming together. 
After the Kansas game I just wanted to create momentum,” Walker said. “We’re going to build off this game and put it be-hind us.”
Eight games into the season, freshmen Devin Robinson and 
Chris Chiozza made quick transitions into collegiate play as the two are already averaging around 20 minutes a game each.
Robinson, who has started four games this season, learned 
quickly the areas in which he needs to improve. Topping the list? His size. 
“I feel like when I gain a little more weight, it’ll be a lot eas-
ier for me to push people around,” Robinson said. “But I feel like my length helps me get rebounds now so I try to use my 
length and speed to get rebounds, I mean I just crash the boards 
as hard as I can and see what the outcome is.”
The 6-foot-8 forward said he’s currently weighing in at 
about 190 pounds — an increase from the 178 pounds he was listed as weighing at the start of the season. He’s set his target weight at about 210.“I’m drinking like four protein shakes a day,” Robinson 
said. “A lot of lifting, three times a week it’s crazy. I’m eating like five times a day.”
The highly touted recruits have begun living up to their 
hype, especially against Yale. 
Robinson seemed to have no problem rebounding, as his six 
tied with Walker and senior Jacob Kurtz for a team and game high. 
Robinson closed out the game with a dunk he rebounded off a missed three-point shot from teammate Zach Hodskins, extending his total points to 9 and Florida’s lead to 38. Chiozza was right behind with eight points, two assists and two steals.
Now that the underclassmen have proven what they’re ca-
pable of, Donovan said his biggest concern is seeing if they can maintain and build off the momentum they initiated.
“I think the next step is, as you’ve seen, inconsistencies from 
players,” Donovan said. “You’ve seen guys like Devin Robin-son at Kansas take a step. Chris Walker, take a step. The biggest thing is: can they continually move and be consistent players—and not so much from a scoring standpoint, but from a reliabil-ity standpoint, an accountability standpoint. Staying focused and engaged, that’s the biggest test right now.”

calm and letting me figure out 
where I wanted to go.”
Haley Lorenzen
UF women’s basketball freshman“She was very good about be-
ing calm and letting me figure out 
where I wanted to go,” Lorenzen said.
In the three games Lorenzen 
has started this season, the ball has moved effectively through the post and the team has rebounded the ball well. 
While Lorenzen is still learning 
the flow of college basketball, as well as learning her teammates ten-dencies, the forward from Iowa has shown a willingness to learn.
 Role Adjustment
Brooke Copeland is used to do-
ing it all. 
When she wasn’t leading some 
form of campus organization or 
winning homecoming queen, she 
was winning AAU national titles 
and running her high school team’s offense, finishing eighth on Bradley Central High School’s all-time scor-
ing list. 
Unafraid to handle the basket-
ball, play in the post or shoot three-
pointers, Copeland was a rare trick of the trade on the court. 
Yet her first season has seen 
Copeland adjust to a bench role, as she’s expected to come off the bench and provide energy in any aspect Florida needs. 
The fluid scorer has altered her style of play by moving more into a guard and forward hybrid role that players like Kayla Lewis and Ronni Williams have had success in.
“Right now I’m changing from a 
4 to a 3, because I’m going to play wherever I’m needed,” Copeland said. “I’m trying to be more in tune with the offense.”
Like Lorenzen, basketball runs 
in the family. 
Her mother, Kim Copeland, 
played basketball at Chattanooga State, and her year-older brother plays for Lee University in her hometown of Cleveland, Tennes-see. 
As Copeland continues to ham-
mer out her role on the team, it’s 
promising to see that the young 
forward comes from a family who seems to possess a penchant and knowledge for basketball that’s rarely seen.
 Playing Tough
Toughness is a trait that can’t be 
taught. It’s in your makeup – you either have it or you don’t. 
And while Dyandria Ander-
son’s doesn’t share the basketball 
pedigree that the out-of-state Cope-
land and Lorenzen have, her innate 
sense of basketball toughness was developed from playing against her twin brother Kendall and her older brother Chris.
“They definitely treated me 
tough,” Anderson said. “They made sure I played hard no matter what. I would get my shot blocked a thousand times but still go up with the next shot.”
Anderson attributes her con-
fidence and ability to recover for the next shot on the physical play she got playing against her broth-ers, and that physicality has helped her develop into a guard who isn’t scared to drive hard to the hoop, unafraid of any potential contact.
A product of Viera High School, 
Anderson’s family has been there to support her as she gets her col-legiate basketball career started. 
If she hadn’t developed an ag-
gressive, physical style from the be-
ginning, it’s unsure if she would be 
as assailing as she is today.26, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 2014

With forward Dorian Finney-
Smith returning to the starting 
lineup, Jacob Kurtz started the game from the bench.
But that didn’t stop the senior 
walk-on from providing valuable playing time during Florida’s 85-47 win against Yale on Monday in the O’Connell Center.
Kurtz led Florida’s bench play-
ers with 25 minutes on the court Monday night. The senior forward from Oveido, Florida, ﬁ  nished the night with a career high 10 points on a perfect 5-of-5 clip from the ﬁ  eld to go along with a game-high-tying six rebounds.
In all, the Gators’ bench contrib-
uted 31 points, while the Bulldogs were able to tally just 12 points from its non-starters.
“The big focus was right from the 
tip, we wanted to play for 40 min-utes,” Kurtz said. “So whenever my number was called, I wanted to go out there with a lot of energy and passion.”
Kurtz capped his scoring with a 
two-handed dunk to give the Gators a 72-29 lead with 10:14 remaining in the game.
Frazier shooting helps team-mates: Michael Frazier found his spots against Yale on Monday.
After shooting at or below 40 per-
cent in every game this season fol-lowing the Miami loss on Nov. 17, the junior shooting guard rattled off a 7-of-11 shooting clip (63.6 percent) from the ﬁ  eld against the Bulldogs, while also going 4 of 7 from beyond the arc en route to an 18-point out-ing.
“I try not to let my conﬁ  dence 
waver, but this deﬁ  nitely feels good,” Frazier said.
Frazier is now making 44.4-per-
cent of his ﬁ  eld-goal attempts this 
season including 39.2-percent from 
downtown.
“We don’t need him to necessar-
ily score,” UF coach Billy Donovan 
said. “We need him to take open 
shots and good shots. And when 
he does that, it creates spacing and it creates opportunities for other guys. And sometimes, when you’re 
a really, really good shooter, actu-
ally it’s not you that beneﬁ  ts. It’s the 
other guys around you that beneﬁ  t because of spacing.”
Notes: After dishing out a career-
high-tying 10 assists on Monday, sophomore point guard Kasey Hill is averaging 4.9 assists per game, which is tied for fourth in the Southeastern Conference. … The Gators recorded 10 steals on Mon-day against the Bulldogs, marking the second time in three games that Florida recorded double-digit steals. UF is fourth in the SEC with an av-erage of eight steals per game and freshman Chris Chiozza leads the conference in total steals (21).

Alligator Writer @_maryfrancis
 At the conclusion of the fall season, UF 
women’s tennis coach Roland Thornqvist 
struggled to ﬁ  nd words to describe the suc-cess of freshman Brooke Austin.
In the Southeast End Zone Meeting Room 
of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, Thornqvist stood at the podium in 10 seconds of silence.
Austin’s ﬁ  rst season at the University 
of Florida has seen her win a title, reach the semiﬁ  nals at a national tournament and be-come the top freshman in Division I Women’s Tennis.
Thornqvist sought to answer the question 
— was it Austin’s athletic talent or match-
winning coaching that got her to the top in 
collegiate tennis?
Austin meets tennisIn Indianapolis, 6-year-old Austin said ten-
nis just felt natural when she tagged along to her neighbor’s tennis lesson.
“I picked up a racket and started playing 
and just really liked it,” she said, “so I asked my mom to sign me up for lessons.”
Six years later, the preteen replaced a mid-
dle school classroom education and physical education class with online learning between constant tennis practice.
Her improvement was considerable and 
fast. 
When high school came around, Austin 
played in the junior division of the U.S. Open several times and by her senior year, she was ranked No. 3 in the nation.
And on Nov. 12, 2013, Austin signed with 
Florida women’s tennis.
Though her family is an 800-mile plane 
ride northwest of Gainesville, she said they 
were happy she signed with the Gators.
“I’ve always tried to do 
it my own way, but they’ve always supported me in whatever I’ve decide to do,” 
Austin said.
On the Florida courtAustin began her career 
at UF during the summer 
when she won the 2014 ITF $10K Palmetto Pro Open in Sumter, South Carolina.
From there she traveled to San Diego, Cali-
fornia, with all eight teammates to compete in the Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships.
The 5-foot-6 freshman qualiﬁ  ed for the na-
tional championships in November in both singles and doubles with her best friend and fellow freshman teammate Peggy Porter.
Austin won the consolation ﬁ  nal in singles, 
and in Flushing, New York, reached the sin-gles semiﬁ  nals at the USTA/ITA National In-door Intercollegiate Championships.
Entering one of the nation’s top tennis pro-
grams ranked No. 5 by the NCAA, Austin’s expectations were low, with little expectation for success in her ﬁ  rst season with Florida. 
“Honestly I just hoped to win one match, I 
was terriﬁ  ed,” Austin said. “That was my only goal.”
Her power is in the strike. A loud thump 
echos in the stadium after each hit Austin 
sends back to her competitors.
“I hit the ball really hard,” she said. “I play 
aggressive.”
But before each play, Austin struggles the 
most when she’s behind the baseline.
“Need to work on my serve,” she said. “It’s 
always been a work in progress.”
Thornqvist and assistant head coach Dave 
Balogh have focused her practices on improv-ing her serve and movement on the court.
Thornqvist said his advice for Austin before 
each match is simple — go for your shots.
“When she does and when she gets to the 
ball, she hits a ball that’s pretty much unstop-
pable,” Thornqvist said.
Six days a week for two to three hours a 
day, Austin is serving, hitting and hitting again. And separate from these practices, the 
team will meet for an hour ﬁ  ve days a week 
for conditioning workouts.
“Brooke physically has changed for the 
better,” Thornqvist said. “She’s stronger and more durable, and I think that alone has af-fected her game in a positive way.”
Friends who competeJust after Austin committed to a life of ten-
nis at 12 years old, she met Peggy Porter.
“The ﬁ  rst time we actually played, she beat 
me 0 and 0, and I couldn’t stand her,” the UF women’s tennis player said. “I thought she was so scary, but then a couple years later we became best friends.”Before Austin signed with Florida, there 
were other options in consideration. North-western, University of North Carolina and 
Georgia were still viable offers for her to play. 
But once Austin heard Porter had signed 
with Florida, her decision was clear.
“She deﬁ  nitely inﬂ  uenced my decision to 
come here,” Austin said. “It was nice knowing 
someone on the team already.”
The friends have played both doubles to-
gether and singles against each other many times this season, and Brooke said it’s never 
fun.
Porter said when she plays Austin it’s like 
a marathon running around the court.
“She hits the ball so hard, it’s ridiculous, 
and she hits it early,” Porter said. “Playing 
her, you’re just running.”
The future in Brooke’s eyesAustin ﬁ  rst stepped on Florida’s blue clay 
with just raw talent and a Wilson racket.
Now with her ﬁ  rst season behind her, the 
Indiana-native has surpassed all her playing expectations and calls the Alfred A. Ring Ten-nis Complex a much warmer, second home.
Post-college, Austin hopes to play profes-
sional tennis.
“There are lots of things that have to be set 
in place for that to happen, but I’d like to do that for a little bit,” she said.
For now Thornqvist is still weighing his 
coaching ability on the freshman superstar.
“We knew (she) was really good and (she) 
got better,” Thornqvist said. “Does that make me look good?”Freshman Brooke Austin off to fast start in collegiate career
