LONGVIEW, Wash. — A 26-year-old 
Washington state man managed to escaped 
from a Department of Corrections car while handcuffed.
Police aren’t just looking for him. They 
also want him to be charged with stealing the handcuffs.
The Daily News of Longview reports that 
Eric Mitchell Lair was arrested Oct. 1 on a felony warrant. He was handcuffed behind his back, but still was able to open the door of the car that was taking him to Cowlitz County jail and run off.
Officers from several agencies searched 
the area but couldn’t find him, and a judge issued a warrant Thursday for his arrest on suspicion of first-degree escape.
Police say the handcuffs are valued at $29, 
and stealing them would constitute third-de-gree theft.

Surrendering the game-winning 
touchdown with just six seconds left 
is demoralizing.
Losing back-to-back contests for 
the first time since 2007 is paralyzing.
And falling to your lowest ranking 
in the Urban Meyer era is humbling.
But there is one thing No. 22 Flori-
da (4-2, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) still has control of after its national championship hopes were dashed in a 33-29 loss to No. 9 LSU on Saturday in The Swamp: its own conference 
destiny.
Despite losing to two SEC op-
ponents, the Gators still have not 
dropped a game within their own di-vision — the SEC East.
“We still can control our own des-
tiny ,” left guard Carl Johnson said. “If we win out, we still make it to Atlanta. We have to win out now. We have no 
room for error. We just blew our last 
chance.” 
That last chance came against the 
Tigers.
Florida had a golden opportunity 
to defeat LSU (6-0, 4-0 SEC) despite being down for most of the game, but the Gators couldn’t secure the victory.UF grabbed the lead on a Mike 
Gillislee 5-yard touchdown run with a little more than three minutes left in the game. But the Gators’ defense let it slip through its hands.
“I didn’t think we had the game,” 
quarterback John Brantley said of the late lead. “I thought we had a good chance, but that’s a good team. They still had plenty of time to go down the field and score.”
The LSU offense — ranked 91st 
nationally in total yards before the 
game — did just 
that. It put together a 62-yard drive 
that ate up almost the entire clock to win. Florida forced a fourth down, but it wasn’t enough 
as Tigers coach Les Miles had yet an-
other trick up his sleeve.
Miles, who is known for his late-
game antics and unconventional deci-
sions, opted for a fake field goal rather than a 53-yard attempt to tie the game. Holder Derek Helton flipped the ball to kicker Josh Jasper, who ran five yards for a first down to extend the drive. The play was similar to the one 
LSU ran in 2007 to beat South Caro-ROAD TO ATLANTA NARROWS

The Harn Museum of Art cel-
ebrated its 20th birthday Friday.
The museum’s founders and 
greatest supporters attended the 
“20 Candles: Come As You Art!” birthday party with coffee and 
birthday cake.
Tickets ranged from $20 for 
one person to $20,000 for different 
packages, and proceeds will fund exhibits at the museum, including framing, publicity and conserva-
tion.
“We are a resource for the cam-
pus,” said Tami Wroath, director of 
marketing and public relations for the museum. “We want to weave the museum into the academic fab-
ric of the university.”
The party started at 6 p.m. with 
dinner for the guests who gave 
bigger donations. Entry times were staggered after that. 
No Southern Accent, a UF a 
capella group, sang “Happy Birth-day” as the guests left dinner. Shortly after, the Pazeni Sauti Af-rica Choir performed.
One of the largest exhibits in the 
museum, “Class Pictures,” was cre-ated by Dawoud Bey as part of his First-Year Florida Project. The gal-lery was filled with photographs 
of UF freshman and quotes about 
their view of art.Museum turns 20

Gay and straight students will celebrate their 
sexuality with rainbow cupcakes and a competi-
tive “Fruit Bowl” in recognition of  National Com-ing Out Day . 
AC Stokes, the director of Lesbian, Gay, Bi-
sexual and Transgender Affairs for UF, said LGBT students and straight allies are invited to attend the event, which will be held on the Plaza of the Americas from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. today.
“It’s for the LGBT people, for the people who 
love them and the people they love,” Stokes said about the event. 
Mayor Craig Lowe, who is openly gay, is ex-pected to attend, according to Stokes. 
Students will be able to participate in the “Fruit 
Bowl,” a four-part relay championship, where teams will compete in various games. 
Ricky Carter, vice president of chapter out-
reach for Pride Student Union, has been planning the event for weeks.
He said there will be a symbolic wooden door 
that anyone can walk through and come out with a secret or statement of pride. 
 Pride Student Union member 
Jeremy Whitaker, said the recent deaths of LGBT youth across America has given more meaning to 
this year’s celebration. 
“For me, it will make me take more pride in 
my sexuality to the world,” he said.Students ‘come out’ at eventSEE FOOTBALL, p AGE 14Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff

Idaho counselor sentenced 
for Medicaid fraud
BOISE, Idaho — A counselor 
found out the hard way that Idaho Medicaid doesn’t pay 
for rap concerts.
The state attorney gener -
al’s office says 26-year-old Lindsay A. Nelson billed 
Medicaid last year for coun-
seling two boys when he actually took them to see the Kottonmouth Kings per -
form.
The agency says Nelson, 
who works in psychosocial rehabilitation, was sentenced Friday in Idaho’s 1st District 
Court to 30 days in jail after 
pleading guilty to one count of Medicaid provider fraud.Authorities say Nelson billed Idaho Medicaid last year for 
providing individual coun-
seling services for the two boys.A state investigation later 
determined that the service 
Nelson provided consisted of him taking a group, which included the two boys, to the rap concert in nearby 
Spokane, Wash.

� THE LUNCHBOX SERVES A 
VARIETY OF FOOD STYLES.
By MEG WAGNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
With just 400 square feet, there 
isn’t a lot of space in The Lunchbox, 
a small restaurant in the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. 
It’s the size of an average two-car 
garage, but there’s just enough room for a refrigerator, a range stove, counter space for assembling dishes 
and limited kitchen basics. 
Space is so tight that extra ingre-
dients are kept in a storage unit a 
mile away , and the restaurant only offers outside seating under dark orange umbrellas and an overhead wooden trellis.
“I can’t even imagine what we 
would do if you gave us an extra 100 
square feet,” co-owner Clea Lauri-
ault said. “We probably wouldn’t be able to handle the spaciousness.”
She said the narrow space forces 
the business to stay organized.
The restaurant, which opened this 
spring, occupies the historic Bethel Station Building in the downtown Bo Diddley Community Plaza. 
Built in 1925, the building origi-
nally functioned as a car service sta-tion. In 2009, Lauriault and her busi-ness partner, Robyn Mole, won the property through the Gainesville Community Redevelopment Agen-cy, a public group that seeks to foster urban and residential rebuilding.The Lunchbox offers breakfast, 
lunch and dinner, and its menu fea-tures sandwiches, tacos, braised beef short ribs on baguettes and tofu rice bowls as permanent menu items. Specials, such as corn dogs fried in duck fat and banana beignets, rotate based on ingredient availability.
Tate Clair, who calls himself a 
“fine-dining chef turned sandwich maker,” helped design the restau-rant’s menu. He said the goal is to keep the food “clean and simple.”
“You use good ingredients, and 
you don’t lose the integrity,” he said.
Clair has worked in the food in-
dustry across the world, from Aus-tralia to Boston. His experience in upscale restaurants inspires the food he creates for The Lunchbox.
“It’s about taking the techniques 
of a skilled chef and simplifying them into a sandwich,” he said.
For Clair, working in a casual 
sandwich shop has been a liberating experience.
“This is a blast,” he said. “There 
are no stressed-out waitresses, no people complaining at table number 12. You don’t have to worry about pleasing every request of a customer who’s dropping [$700] on a meal.”
Clair said that on an average day , 
he serves meals to about 120 people, with many more patrons purchas-ing drinks and snacks.
Friday nights, when the city hosts 
free concerts on the plaza, the restau-rant serves upwards of 450 meals.
The free concert series that began 
in May is set to end Friday , but The Lunchbox is optimistic that its busi-ness will continue to thrive.
Lauriault said other downtown 
events, such as November’s Down-
town Festival and Art Show, will 
help fill the void once the concert series ends.
She also said The Lunchbox has a 
following of regular customers who frequent the café on a daily basis.
UF senior anthropology major 
Josey Heston said she finds herself 
craving the restaurant’s pulled pork 
sandwiches.
“This is different than any other 
restaurant I’ve been to,” she said. 
“It’s really fresh and completely 
unique.”

  PERRINE — A crowd of hun-
dreds ﬁ  lters into a neighbor’s 
backyard expecting to see some-thing brutal: bloodied noses and 
punched-out teeth, blackened eyes 
and broken jaws, as stardom-hun-gry pugilists pummel each other on a manicured lawn.
  A man in a red mohawk referees 
the action inside a 12-foot-square ring, enforcing the two explicit rules: No hits to the back of the head. No jabs to the testicles.
  When the winner celebrates, 
a third rule becomes clear: Know where the phone cameras are. For although a crowd of 200 watches this day, hundreds of thousands more might watch on a blurry vid-eo on the Internet, where celebrity is democratic and pain can lead to fame.
  Backyard ﬁ  ghting’s been around 
as long as there have been back-yards. But it’s only since the advent of viral web videos that recordings of everyday people clawing at each other has been a launching pad for stardom. Exhibit A is Kimbo Slice, the scary man from Perrine whose footage beating people up made 
him one of the most hyped Mixed 
Martial Arts ﬁ  ghters in the country.
  Now another Perrine man is 
hoping to organize this gritty un-derbelly of the cyberworld and transform it into a multimillion dol-lar, multimedia industry.
  The cyberworld knows him 
as Dada 5000. His mother named 
him Dhaﬁ  r Harris. He’s a little Don 
King, a little P .T. Barnum, a little Justin Bieber.
  Born and raised in Perrine, Har-
ris, 33, is a lean, mean-looking pro-moting machine — 6-foot-4 and 270 pounds with a 650-pound bench-press. His big beard protrudes from his chin like the edge of a battle-ax. His toes and ﬁ  ngernails are lac-
quered black. His muscular frame is 
shrouded with tattoos: Two boxing gloves behind his left earlobe, “No Fear” inscribed on his arm, a “No to Drugs” illustration on his left pec.
  His thumbs, he believes, are even 
mightier than his ﬁ  sts: He promotes through text messages to the 1,000-plus people listed in his Blackberry. 
The ﬁ  ghts happen before sunset, so 
there’ll be enough light to gather click-worthy footage on YouTube.
  Some videos have already got-
ten as many as 200,000 hits on the site, though many have gotten tens of thousands. The producers of 
the acclaimed local ﬁ  lm “Cocaine 
Cowboys” are releasing a docu-mentary about him. Local and na-tional media alike have dropped by. Telemundo produced a documen-tary about Rene “Level” Martinez, a mixed-martial-arts ﬁ  ghter who got his start in Harris’ mom’s back-yard.
  While not the most conventional 
way to help a community, Harris has convinced himself that he’s do-
ing a service. Winners get a share 
of the purse, about $300. Losers get $50 — enough for bandages.
  The gladiators in Harris’ world 
include a high-school wrestling champion and MMA ﬁ  ghters, but most are on the lowest rungs on of the social ladder — dropouts, rejects and felons who Harris said “can count on one hand the number of times they’ve been acknowledged for something good.”
  Is it legal? Probably not. The 
state’s boxing commission says it has never investigated Harris’ franchise, but there are no medi-cal doctors on hand, as there are in professional ﬁ  ghts. Nor has the commission sanctioned Harris for amateur ﬁ  ghts. Unsanctioned ﬁ  ghts are third-degree felonies.
  But police have shown up only 
to disperse crowds that have spilled into the sidewalk, residents say. The Miami-Dade Police Department’s records show it has never received a phone complaint.
  In fact, some neighbors have 
used the ﬁ  ghts for their own en-trepreneurial goals. When a ﬁ  ght 
happens, the woman across the 
street sells conch fritters. The house around the corner holds car wash-es.
  “I don’t like it, but in this neigh-
borhood, people mind their own business,” neighbor Christine Goods, 59, said. “Those ﬁ  ghts give people something to do on a Satur-
day, and they happen on his prop-
erty.”
  As the ﬁ  ghts became more 
popular, Harris has become more cautious. Nowadays, Harris gets ﬁ  ghters to sign waivers that the promoter can’t be held responsible for any injuries.
  Harris understands that some 
people see all this as strange, cruel and barbaric.
  They see him as a bad ambassa-
dor to the community. Those peo-ple, he said, don’t understand the struggles in Perrine.
  “Would you rather have them in 
my backyard, or in your backyard, getting ready to rob you?” Harris says. 4, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2010

� HE IS THE FIFTH UF GRADUATE TO HOLD THE 
POSITION.
By JERRY BRUNO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Law students got a little lecture about their future Friday 
afternoon.
Stephen Zack, president of the American Bar Association 
and UF alumnus, spoke at the law school about how the next 
generation of lawyers will be remembered in a time when the justice system will constantly be changing.
Zack was made the youngest president of the ABA in August, becoming the fifth UF law graduate and the first Hispanic American to hold the position.  
The law is going to change faster in the 
next 10 years than it has changed in the last 100 years, he said.
“This generation of lawyers will prac-
tice in virtual classrooms,” Zack told the students. 
The greatest challenge for this genera-
tion of lawyers, he said, is preserving the justice system.
Our justice system is not a line item in our budget,” Zack 
said. 
“We in America must protect our courts.” As president of the 400,000-plus member ABA, Zack has 
said he will work toward gaining equal access to justice for all segments of society, a major focal point of his presiden-cy. 
Other important issues Zack plans to focus on will be suf-
ficient funding of the judiciary, the growing use of technolo-gy in the legal world and emphasizing the importance of the proper civic education of younger generations of students. 
After his lecture, Zack distributed awards recognizing 
outstanding students in the law school.
Having the leader of the ABA present the awards and 
interact with other students will make this book award cer -
emony extra special, said Rachel Inman, UF’s law school as-sociate dean for students. Grad, American Bar Association president speaks

A line of people wraps around Emerson 
Alumni Hall, and students can be seen con-
versing in lawn chairs, sleeping on blankets or 
working on homework.
Some have been there since 4:30 that morn-
ing, some have been there since the previous 
night. 
But they’re all there for one thing – a T-
shirt. 
About 2,000 people encircled the building 
Friday morning, waiting to pick up their “Beat 
LSU” T-shirt. 
The shirts are given out to members of the 
Student Alumni Association before the five 
biggest games of the football season, said SAA 
Vice President Dylan Nuquist. 
Nuquist said he is proud of the phenomenon 
the T-shirts have become on campus.
“It’s exciting to show the spirit we have here 
at the University of Florida,” he said. “I think it shows that common bond we all have. After 
a game like Bama, we came out here and we’re still strong.”
For some students, that is the exact reason 
they get in line.
“I love my school,” said Chris Koury, a 21-
year-old microbiology major who got in line at 
4:30 a.m. “I support it. I think it’s the most pas-
sionate university in the state of Florida.
But 4:30 a.m. is nowhere near the earliest 
people began to line up. 
That achievement belongs to the die-hard 
of the die-hard, a 14-person group that has dubbed itself “Those Guys.” 
The first members of the group arrived at 
9:30 p.m. the night before, armed with an air 
mattress, blankets and laptops. More followed at 1 a.m.
The group, mostly comprised of freshmen, 
said they do this to show school spirit and stand out at the university. 
“There’s 52,000 kids out here,” said Mathias 
Sengberg, an 18-year-old marketing major. “You’ve gotta be remembered for something. This is our tradition; our legacy.”
Farther down the line sat engineering junior 
Meghan Ferrall, who said she has collected 15 
of the T-shirts since her freshman year in 2008. 
She said she still waits in line to keep up with 
old friends despite her busy class schedule.
“We don’t see each other most of the time,” 
she said. “So it’s time to get together and see [each other.]”
In order to get the shirts, which have been 
handed out since 2006, students have to be SAA members. Non-members are able to reg-
ister on-site and get shirts. 
Once the doors opened, the line moved fast. 
Students at the front of the line collected their 
belongings and their bounty: the blue shirts 
with an orange gator and “Beat LSU” written 
on the front, the reward for the long wait en-
dured by people like Chris Koury.
“Behind the word ‘beat’ is dedication,” he 
said.Thousands of students line 
up to get free ‘beat’ T-shirtsZack

Today’s question: Are you worried about UF’s reputation?
98 TOTAL VOTES20% YES80% NOFriday’s question: Would the Naked Cowboy make a good president?
Only voters have reasons to complain
Despite what you might have been told, voting in 
midterm elections does matter. 
Is President Obama on the ballot? Well, no. 
That doesn’t make the election any less important though. In a representative democracy we don’t get to vote on every proposed law, so the only real say we have is who votes on the laws for us. That’s why elec-
tions, such as the one for Florida’s U.S. senator, are still 
important. 
Even if none of the candidates have a slogan as catchy 
as “Yes we can.”
Do you like Obamacare and did you jump for joy 
when it passed? Or were you one of the majority of Americans who did not agree with the passage of the bill? Quite frankly, no matter which side you fall on, no one from the Senate really asked for our opinions; they 
were more concerned about which way their party was 
voting. 
And now is your time to give them your opinion. Of course none of this applies to just the health care 
law. Any decision you have an opinion on will do. It’s 
really quite simple, too. All you have to do is find out 
which candidate shares your viewpoint on whatever is-sue you think is important, and just go out and vote for him or her. 
This is the best way to make your opinions heard on 
Capitol Hill. 
And don’t think for a minute the only elections that 
are important are the federal ones. 
The health care issue applies to the Florida attorney 
general election as well. 
Do you want to vote for a candidate who will con-
tinue Bill McCollum’s lawsuit against the federal gov-ernment or a candidate who would 
pull back a bit? Either way, there is 
a candidate for you. 
You might even argue the most 
important elections we have com-ing up are the statewide elections. 
One of them just so happens to be 
that no-big-deal governor election. 
The choices might not be all that 
great for this one, but your vote still matters. I assume 
most people out there care about the sky-high unem-
ployment rate and horrible economy of our state. That’s just one of the many important issues that are at stake in this election. Just seeing which candidate’s opinion matches up with your own allows your viewpoints to 
be heard the way they were meant to be. 
So many people feel like it doesn’t even matter what 
they believe. This might explain why voter turnout is 
so much lower in midterm election years than in years 
when a presidential candidate is on the ballot. 
A senator who has gone against the will of his or her 
constituents can be voted out in favor of someone who 
they believe will serve them better. But to do that, you have to vote first.
Lets face it, everyone wants to have his or her opin-
ions heard. Most people have a stance on whether they like a certain president of ours or not. Coincidentally, a lot of us like to voice our opinions too. So, if you’re 
going to complain about a member of government, the 
least you can do is make a difference with your vote. 
If you don’t vote, then don’t complain.Chris Dodson is a first-year political science and finance

UF no longer an            
academic, athletic force
Gator glory is dead.
If we have learned anything this year, it’s that 
UF’s once-glorified image of indestructibility and 
infallibility are facades. 
As UF’s football team groveled for its second loss in 
a row Saturday, Gators face the undeniable notion that 
without Tebow, the rise and demise of UF as an image of perfection and envy was quick and ruthless. 
It might be hard to swallow, but with the Tebow Era be-
hind us, the images of National Championships long for -
gotten, Gators are no longer so revered on or off the field. 
We’re not assuming the exit of Tebow simultaneously 
signaled the fall of UF from statewide academic glory, but 
we recognize his departure was a significant factor in re-
turning UF to its days of mediocrity. 
With Miami claiming Florida’s top academic spot in the 
rankings of best colleges this year, Gators across the state can no longer say they attend the best or the brightest state 
institution. 
Because, right now, they don’t. It’s an unpopular opinion, but it’s true. Tebow’s exit 
from Gainesville signaled a weakness that let schools in Baton Rouge, Coral Gables and Tuscaloosa seize our 
thrones of academic and athletic triumphs so typically and 
unquestionably reserved for Gators in the past. 
As much as President Machen says our football team’s 
performance has no effect on our school’s academic noto-
riety, we can’t help but wonder how much he disagrees with his own words. 
UF’s newly built pharmacy school near Orlando won’t 
be known to teenagers in Idaho. They’ll know of our em-barrassing loss in The Swamp on Saturday. They’ll know 
UF is no longer the best.
They’ll know UF isn’t so indestructibly perfect. And it’s hard to deny the statistics of “coincidentally” 
increased admission applications during our years of ath-letic glory. 
But certainly, you say, UF continues to admit a class 
brighter than the year before with higher SAT scores than the class before it, with more vivacious desires to be a 
Gator, and with better-written essays, bigger smiles and 
higher GPAs. 
Surely, this is a sign Tebow’s exit didn’t return UF to 
academic and athletic warfare, fighting for its rightful po-
sition atop Florida’s throne. 
But who are we comparing ourselves to? Of course our 
new class is going to be brighter than the last. Competi-
tion among high school graduates is increasing across the 
country, not just at UF. 
If we compare ourselves to ourselves, the waters ap-
pear to be calm. But it’s others’ views of us that should matter. It’s our reputation that matters.
And it’s in jeopardy, Gators. You’d be foolish to think 
otherwise. 
Regardless if you want to blame our double-loss on 
the football field to John Brantley’s inexperience, Steve 
Addazio’s future diagnosis as insane or a general cycle of 
greatness which UF is now clawing at to get a sliver, any Gator would be foolish to suggest academics and athletics 
aren’t intertwined in our university’s image.
With UF’s embarrassing fall from statewide academic 
glory coupled with the swift and painful departure of our 
Heisman-winning, nationally renowned, God-given sav-ior, we’re hurting, Gators.

Letters to the Editor
 Americans not apathetic toward politics   
  Nate Rushing’s Friday column was 
much more pitiful than whatever he thinks 
of our country’s political activity. 
  Starting with his disgraceful mocking of 
the Founding Fathers wrapped in sarcasm, he is disdainful toward every American who has fought to have the right to vote. Just because he   is apathetic and his friend is ignorant does not mean the entire country could not care less.
  In fact, the reason political pundits make 
the news so much is because people do care. Americans want to know about the issues and the personal lives of their politicians, not because they’re ﬂ  at and boring, but be-cause they are interesting and make an im-pact on our lives. If people don’t vote, it’s because they are too concerned with them-selves to see the bigger impact government has on our lives.
  As chair of the College Republicans, I 
strive to remind students of the purpose of voting and why Republican candidates, far from being monotonous, are actually quite 
inspiring. 
  Marco Rubio, candidate for U.S. Senate, 
is truly a man of the people and worth get-
ting students out to the polls. He represents the American dream and revival of political 
activism in this country. 
  I would challenge Rushing to ﬁ  nd an-
other country where a son of Cuban exiles 
can rise up and go to college — UF, might I add — and then  on to law school, only to 
become Speaker of the Florida House and 
now a Senatorial candidate.  If Rushing is so disappointed with the 
political nature of his friends, perhaps he 
should consider checking out the College Republicans who are still working tirelessly 
to elect legitimate ofﬁ  cials to help the coun-
try.

 UF campus should get it together on 
game days   
  Saturday’s whole experience for most of 
The Gator Nation was horrible, but I’m not writing to complain about players or the re-
sult of the game. 
  It started at 10 in the morning when Uni-
versity Police closed off half of the campus 
without explanation, not letting me park 
in the spot I’ve been at for 13 years. After 
I parked and carried my things to our usu-
al place, I ﬁ  nd that there are spots every-
where. 
  As a season ticketholder, I was not e-mailed about this. I checked the newspaper, 
and the only thing there was a public ser-
vice announcement informing me alcohol is not allowed at any outside location in Gainesville,   including tailgates. 
  If Bernie really wants to enforce that gar-
bage and start closing off campus nine hours before kickoff, I can watch the game at home,  see replays and not drive three hours.
  It would also be nice if the band would be 
quiet when we have the ball. 
  I know I don’t give a million dollars to 
the school, but my wife and I are alumni and season ticketholders and should not be treated like crap. 
  But on a side note, I would like to thank 
Urban for the orange jerseys.

 The incoherence of the tea party   
  The tea party movement has deﬁ  nitely 
been the star of the election season, causing 
quite a stir in the primary elections earlier this year. 
  However, it now seems the country is ﬁ  -
nally seeing how out-of-touch the tea-party-
backed Republican candidates seem to be. 
Their views of extreme social conservatism and ﬁ  scal incoherence are resonating in a less-than-stellar way. The incoherence of 
the party is not relegated to local races but rather widespread across the country.  
  In Nevada, Republican U.S. Senate can-
didate Sharron Angle is infamous for her anti-government stances across the board, especially when it comes to health care. Yet, 
both she and her husband are on govern-
ment health care plans. 
  In the race for Delaware’s U.S. Senate seat, 
vacated by Vice President Biden, the tea par-
ty- backed Republican Christine O’Donnell 
(who, by the way, would like the public to know she is not a witch) is campaigning to 
bring ﬁ  scal responsibility to Washington. Yet she used campaign funds to pay rent for a 
townhouse she was living in after her house 
had been foreclosed.
  If you want to know her social views, 
a simple search of her name on YouTube will give you hours of entertainment with 
her anti-masturbation speeches and tirades 
against evolution. 
  Then we have our own situation in Flor-
ida. Tea party-backed candidate Rick Scott, who narrowly defeated establishment can-
didate Bill McCollum, champions himself 
as a ﬁ  scally savvy individual when, in real-
ity, he was involved with the single largest 
health care fraud scheme this country has 
ever seen.
  His “7-7-7 plan,” which is supposed to 
put 700,000 Floridians back to work, will cut 
more than 5 percent of the state’s workforce 
and slash funding for basic safety services as 
ﬁ  re and police departments. 
  Ultimately, come November the country 
has a choice. We can allow the tea party to 
leach its way into the halls of Tallahassee 
and Washington, or side with the Democrats who are ﬁ  ghting to revive this economic mess that took Republicans more than six 
years to make.

Students built a house in the mid-
dle of the Reitz Union North Lawn on 
Friday.
The wooden house was construct-
ed as part of World Habitat Day, an 
event sponsored by the UF chapter of 
Habitat for Humanity.
The group wanted to promote 
environmentally friendly lifestyle 
changes and the need to help the less fortunate. 
“People buy nails, using whatever 
spare change they have in their pock-ets, write down the change they wish to see in the world, and nail it onto the house,” said Annaliese Thuijs, 
the vice president for Habitat for Hu-
manity.
The messages varied from in-
spirational memos 
such as ‘smile more’ 
to various other 
wishes of peace and change. 
The house was 
built by UF Habitat for Humanity mem-bers throughout the 
day.
It took approximately three hours 
for the group to complete the house.“It could have probably taken 
about an hour and a half, but people 
came and built in between classes,” 
Thuijs said. 
“It’s sort of how habitat works; 
people come out when they can, even 
if they’re really busy.”
Members of the group also handed 
out free soda to those who stopped 
by, with the condition that those who 
accepted the drinks finished the bot-
tle at the table.
“We want to see you recycle it,” 
Thuijs said.
The event was a first for the orga-
nization.

Every Saturday during football season, 
Blake Bork dons his orange, white and 
blue uniform, harnesses his tenor drums to his body and marches with the Pride of 
the Sunshine.
But Bork won’t return to campus until 
marching band practice. 
That’s because Bork is one of the 20 
Santa Fe College students who are mem-
bers of the marching band and drumline at UF. 
Out of the 400 to 500 students who au-
dition every year, usually 320 are chosen 
to be a part of the marching band and drumline.
 About 20 of these students are from 
SFC.
Enrolled as non-degree seeking stu-
dents, the SFC students take the universi-ty’s one credit hour Marching Band course, 
MUN1110. 
The SFC students are given a Gator 1 
carda and identification number, limited access to ISIS, uniforms, instruments and 
any other supplies needed by band mem-
bers. 
They are not permitted to sign up for 
any courses at UF other than Marching 
Band.
John M. Watkins Jr., director of The 
Pride of the Sunshine marching band, compared the process to students dual en-rolling at UF.
To join the marching band, the SFC stu-
dents have to go through the same annual 
audition as UF students, according to Wat-
kins 
The SFC students can only play in the 
marching band and drumline. 
They are also not eligible for scholar -
ships and stipends because those things are only offered to full-time students at UF.
Bork, a freshman at SFC, said he chose 
to go to SFC over other colleges so he 
could have a chance at joining The Pride 
of the Sunshine.
“As long as I’m part of University of 
Florida I’m happy,” Bork said. “I’ve al-
ways been a UF kid, ever since I was in elementary school.”
Bork said the UF students in the drum-
line get along with the students from Santa Fe, and the band works together well as a team.
“We all share a common interest,” Bork 
said. “And that’s drumming.”UF’s marching band includes 20 Santa Fe students
They nailed messages to walls“We all share a common interest, 
and that’s drumming.”

� THE RULING COULD HAVE CAUSED A DELAY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — The U.S. government announced 
Sunday it would prosecute the first Guantanamo Bay 
detainee to face a civilian trial without its star witness because appealing a judge’s ruling excluding him could cause significant delay and inconvenience other wit-
nesses and victims.
Besides, the government said in a letter to U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, there was enough evidence 
without the star witness to convict Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani of conspiring in 1998 to blow up two U.S. em-bassies in Africa, killing 224 people, including a dozen Americans.
The decision by the government not to appeal clears 
the way for the trial to resume Tuesday, when opening 
statements are expected to begin after a jury is chosen 
from a pool of about 65 potential jurors in Manhattan.
In the letter, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Farbiarz 
said the government disagreed with the judge’s decision and would have appealed it under different circum-stances. But he said many trial witnesses had planned to come to New York based on the long-scheduled date of the trial and some might even be unwilling or unable to return if the trial faced a significant delay.
He said many victims have already arrived in New 
York after a long wait to see Ghailani face trial after hav-ing traveled significant distances.
“An appeal at this juncture would obviously cause 
a delay — a delay of uncertain, and per -
haps significant, length,” the letter said. “Weighing all of the circumstances, the government does not wish to delay the 
trial in order to take an appeal.”
The judge had handed the government a significant 
setback days earlier when he ruled that the star witness, Hussein Abebe, a former cab driver from Tanzania, could not testify that Ghailani bought explosives from him. 
The judge said the government learned about Abebe 
when Ghailani underwent a coercive interrogation at a secret CIA-run camp overseas.
“The court has not reached this conclusion lightly,” 
the judge wrote in his decision. “It is acutely aware of the perilous nature of the world in which we live. But the Constitution is the rock upon which our nation rests. We must follow it not when it is convenient, but when fear and danger beckon in a different direction.”
During that hearing, defense lawyer Peter Quijano 
tried to show that Abebe felt coerced to testify because he feared law enforcement, but Abebe insisted that was not so.
Another lawyer for Ghailani, Steve Zissou, said the 
government’s decision not to appeal was “a significant victory for the Constitution.”Gov’t won’t appeal

POLL QUESTION TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETT Fake FG Rule BLEDSOE NOTCHES 
CAREER-HIGH FOUR ACES AGAINST BULLDOGS.
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
 
Before Sunday’s meeting 
against Mississippi State, Florida 
coach Mary Wise said the key to the match would be serving and passing.
The No. 2 Gators (13-1, 6-0) 
dominated the Bulldogs (11-6, 3-3) in both categories en route to a 3-0 (25-14, 25-20, 25-16) victory in Starkville, Miss.
Florida has now gone three 
straight matches without dropping 
a set.
The Gators recorded zero recep-
tion errors and nine aces
“This was one of our better 
serving-passing performances of 
the season,” Wise said.
Senior middle blocker Lauren 
Bledsoe set a career high with four service aces. She also hit a match-high .692 with nine kills on 13 total 
attacks. 
Junior middle blocker Cassan-
dra Anderson also came up big for the Gators with eight kills on 12 
swings, hitting .667. 
Bledsoe and Anderson were er -
rorless in the match.
“I thought Lauren and Cassan-
dra both played really well today,” Wise said. “They anchored our de-fense that held Mississippi State to just .161 hitting, touched a lot of balls and were equally impres-sive offensively. We rely heavily on our middle blockers, and they were very good today.”
In the first set, the Gators were 
only up 11-9 before rallying with nine consecutive points — three of which were back-to-back-to-back aces by Bledsoe. The Gators went on to hit .320 in the first set.
After the Gators only recorded 
.242 percentage in the second set, the team bounced back with a .400 hitting percentage in the final set 
to finish at .327 as a team for the 
day.
The Gators held the Bulldogs to 
just a .161 hitting percentage.
“That’s the number I’m most 
pleased with,” Wise said. “We’re not going to be able to ace people off the court every night. I think we were able to put the heat on them early.”
Junior setter Kelly Murphy hit 
.476 to go along with 13 kills and 21 assists — both match highs. She also pitched in on defense with seven digs.
Freshman setter Chanel Brown 
recorded 16 assists, a service ace and six digs. Wise said that as Brown gets better, so too will Mur -
phy.
“Kelly’s got one of the elite hit-
ting arms in the country,” Wise said. “As Chanel gets more reps and experience, it’s not good for 
our opponents.”
After a hard-fought 3-0 (25-23, 
25-21, 25-20) victory at Alabama 
on Friday, the Gators responded with an easy win Sunday.
“What this team understands 
is that we’re a work in progress,” Wise said. “Every time we get bet-ter in one area then we go to the next.”
A radio broadcast contributed to 
this report.

Vote on alligatorSports.org An SEC spokesperson said LSU’s fake 
field goal was treated as a backward pass 
instead of a fumble Saturday. If it had been a fumble, the Tigers would not have been allowed to advance the ball on fourth down.By KYLe MAISTRI

LSU came into Saturday night’s showdown in The 
Swamp with the second-worst scoring offense in the 
Southeastern Conference but made use of a short field 
time and again in a 33-29 win against Florida. 
The Tigers ran off 16 unanswered points on three 
possessions that started from the Gators’ side of the 
field after falling behind 14-10 in the second quarter. 
UF’s defense was put in tough situations by its of-
fense, which failed to move the ball against LSU and twice turned it over on the wrong side of the 50-yard 
line. 
“It’s a team game, and obviously our offense didn’t 
hold up their end of the bargain,” coach Urban Meyer 
said. “It’s a team game, and obviously our offense 
didn’t hold up their end of the bargain”

UF football coach
Orange!
Boo!
Florida’s loss to LSU on Saturday will be 
memorable for many reasons, but I’ll remember it as the night Gators fans decided they were fed up with the 2010 
squad’s offense.
For the first time in five years of watching games in 
The Swamp, I heard the UF faith-
ful boo their own team.
This wasn’t the leave-Tebow-in 
booing of the 2006 Kentucky game, 
this was thousands of fans voicing 
their displeasure four times dur -
ing the Gators’ 80-yard, go-ahead touchdown drive in the fourth quarter.
A dump pass to Emmanuel 
Moody in the flat and three runs up the middle were all followed by jeers. Some of those on Moody’s 
catch were undoubtedly “Moos,” but there was no con-
fusing the reaction to the next play.
Wildcat quarterback Trey Burton took the snap and 
ran for two yards, and catcalls came raining down from 
Mike McCall

Like I See It
mmccall@alligator.org
Twitter: @McCallin_ItIn the second quarter, the 
Gators took over on their 
own 5-yard line after mul-
tiple penalties backed them 
up on a punt return. The of-fense moved backward to the 1-yard line over three plays, 
and punter Chas Henry could 
only unload a 38-yard punt as he kicked with his heels on the back of the end zone. 
Two plays later, Jarrett Lee 
found Terrence Toliver, who broke a tackle and dragged Janoris Jenkins into the end zone, completing a 38-yard 
catch and run. 
“(Missed tackles) were def-
initely a problem,” linebacker 
Jon Bostic said. “That’s one thing we say: We play great 
defense here, and we can’t 
have missed tackles.”
On the next offensive se-
ries, UF running back Em-
manuel Moody broke through 
to the second level of LSU’s defense but fumbled, setting up the Tigers for a field goal as time ran out in the second 
quarter. 
LSU’s offense had to wait 
until the fourth quarter to score 
again, this time taking over on 
the UF 38-yard line after quar -
terback John Brantley’s pass 
was tipped and intercepted by Morris Claiborne. This time Jordan Jefferson punched in a 3-yard run to put the Tigers ahead 26-14. 
In all, LSU scored 16 points 
while moving the ball a com-bined 98 yards. 
LSU came into the game 
averaging 131 passing yards 
per contest, but Lee and Jef-
ferson combined to throw for 224 yards while turning the ball over just once. After last week’s game 
with Alabama, in which the Crimson Tide scored two touchdowns after taking over on UF’s side of the field, de-
fensive coordinator Teryl Aus-
tin said his group has to do a better job in “sudden change” situations.  
But his unit once again 
couldn’t overcome being backed into a corner by its own offense.lina. 
The trick play proved its worth 
when LSU wide receiver Terrence 
Toliver caught a game-winning fade 
pass in front of UF cornerback Jer -
emy Brown on the left side of the south end zone with six seconds 
left.
But the result didn’t just fall on 
the Gators’ defense.
Florida’s offense did little for 
most of the game, as has been the 
case for most of the season.
The unit came into the game 
ranked 84th in total offense and fell to 96th after a subpar performance Saturday. The Gators’ offense to-taled 65 yards in the first half, mark-
ing the fourth time UF has been held 
to fewer than 100 first-half yards this season.
“I have to attribute [the offensive 
struggles] to something,” Meyer said. “That’s our job. We are strug-gling right now. How’s that for at-tributing it to something? We got to get a little better and try to get every-
body healthy.”
Apparently Brantley is one of the 
guys who needs to work his way 
back to 100 percent. A report sur -
faced that the UF quarterback sus-tained four broken ribs and a broken thumb in his throwing hand in the loss to Alabama. A UF spokesman denied the injury and so did Meyer.
“They’re not cracked,” said 
Meyer, who added that Brantley just has a sprained thumb. “There’s something in the side of the ribs, but I don’t want to say cracked ribs. There’s some damage to his ribs.”
The junior fought through the 
injuries and played the entire game. But he threw for just 154 yards along 
with an interception. His touch-
down-to-interception ratio is now 6:4 this season, giving him the 10th-worst passing efficiency in the SEC. 
The running backs didn’t help 
Brantley’s cause, either.
Junior Jeff Demps (sprained foot) 
missed the game despite dressing out. Emmanuel Moody and Mike 
Gillislee played in his place and ran 
for 34 and 20 yards, respectively . Florida’s offense will have to im-
prove if it wants to achieve its goal of an SEC Championship because the road to Atlanta looked a little tougher Saturday . Not just because of UF’s loss, but because of South Carolina’s victory against Alabama.
If the Gators can right the ship 
and avoid any other letdowns, the division will likely come down to a Nov . 13 showdown against the Gamecocks in Gainesville.
“I don’t know anybody that likes 
this feeling,” Johnson said. “If you like this feeling then you’re a born loser. I don’t like it. So I already 
know I can’t do this week in and 
week out.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2010

Jelani 
JenkinsIn a pinch, Moore has been quarterback John Brantley’s favorite 
target this season. Going back to the Tennessee game four weeks 
ago, only one of Moore’s 12 catches did not move the chains
(his  six-yard catch in the third quarter). More impressive all 11 of those catches came on third or fourth downs. And his last haul Saturday was his biggest, converting a 3rd-and-8 pass into a 51-yard gain, the longest pass play for Florida this season.  
4 catches, 95 yards
With the exception of his first-quarter effort against Kentucky (when he recorded all of his four career catches), Debose had 
not made an impact on the Florida offense prior to Saturday, 
leaving some fans to write off the once-promising prospect. 
But Debose’s first career touchdown could not have come at 
a more opportune time for the Gators. Down 26-14, Debose bolted down the left sideline for an 88-yard kickoff return.

many of the 90,721 fans in atten-
dance.
I have little doubt as to whom 
they were meant for, and it wasn’t Burton.
Plenty of excuses can be made 
for Florida’s underwhelming of-fense, but the simple fact remains that the Gators’ attack is lacking bite.
Ranked 76th in rushing, 87th in 
passing and 96th  in total offense, UF isn’t even a shadow of its for -
mer self, and last year’s offense left 
something to be desired as well.
The common denominator 
in these two seasons is offensive 
coordinator Steve Addazio, who took over when Dan Mullen left to be Mississippi State’s head coach. Mullen will be back Saturday, and Addazio can’t afford to be shown up by his former boss.
Struggles in 2009 could be over -
looked because the Gators kept winning, but this year they’ve mostly pulled out victories in spite of the offense. Slow starts against Miami (Ohio), South Florida and Tennessee were embarrassing, but the past two weeks have been a heightened display of futility.
UF managed just six points at 
Alabama. And despite putting up 29 against the Tigers, 21 came via a kickoff return and touchdown drives of 16 and 17 yards.
For those reasons, fans should have booed.
Football is entertainment. Fan-
dom makes it more personal than that, but the bottom line is that ev-ery week fans pay a lot of money for tickets, parking and food. And they shouldn’t settle for their team 
underachieving.
Second-guessing a coach’s 
play-calling can be a tricky busi-
ness, but Addazio has been at the helm long enough for fans to form an opinion. 
They made their thoughts clear 
Saturday night, booing Addazio for the plays that have become his 
stereotype — runs up the middle.
And when Carl Moore ripped 
off a 51-yard catch-and-run, Andre 
Debose came in motion to take a handoff around the left side and Omarius Hines took a reverse pitch, the crowd roared.
Those plays were creative and 
fun to watch. And with the caveat 
of a penalty on Hines’ run, they 
worked.
Florida has deserved cheers 
since Meyer arrived in 2005. But in between the adulation, fans have the right to be honest with their teams.
They should boo because the 
offense is dull. Boo because every-one from the hot dog vendor to the 
SunSports commentator knew that 
fake field goal was coming, yet the Gators didn’t. 
Boo — and cheer — when it’s 
warranted, because it’s the only way to communicate.

and caught two touchdowns against Florida.The Gators front-seven did not do a good job Saturday. LSU’s 
161 rushing yards were the most against the Florida defense since facing South Florida’s unbalanced attack. But Jenkins’ 
47-yard interception return was exactly what the Gators’ 
idle offense needed. Trailing 3-0 in the first quarter, Jenkins 
stepped in front of a pass from quarterback Jordan Jefferson 
and returned the ball to the LSU 17-yard line. Five plays later, 
the Gators took the lead.

 THE UF WOMEN CAME IN FIFTH.
  By JOHN BOOTHE

 UF’s cross country teams traveled to Tal-
lahassee on Friday to compete in a race. FSU 
turned it into a training session.
  “They didn’t run hard,” UF coach Todd 
Morgan said. “It’s bizarre. I really don’t know 
a way to describe it, but it’s what they chose 
to do.”  Morgan predicted earlier in the week that 
the Seminoles, like the Gators, would rest the top half of their runners for next week’s Pre-National race in Terre Haute, Ind. The runners who did race would then be able to use the 
FSU Invitational as a springboard for a spot in 
the conference meet.
  Instead, FSU chose to run more than 50 
runners compared to the ﬁ  ve women and ﬁ  ve men UF brought to the meet. But those Gators runners led the No. 30 men’s team to a second-
place ﬁ  nish and the No. 27 women’s team to a 
ﬁ  fth-place ﬁ  nish.  Only a few Seminoles runners in the wom-
en’s 5K and men’s 8K races chose to compete at a high level, Morgan said. The rest used 
the race as a practice session, cruising along the Apalachee Regional Park.
  In the men’s division, those 
that did compete were a wel-
come challenge to the eventual 
race winner, UF sophomore 
Alex Schanen, who broke FSU’s course record with a 24:45.3 run.
  “It was interesting,” Schanen said. “But it’s not a big deal. We’ll see them again at Region-als. So we’ll be ready for them then.”
  After a slow, conservative start over the 
ﬁ  rst two miles of the race, Schanen said he be-gan to move to the front of the pack, where a 
small selection of runners were collecting. He 
paced himself with that group until a quarter of a mile remained and then “took off,” leav-
ing second- and third-place ﬁ  nishers, Ben 
Martucci (Florida Southern) and unattached racer Seth Proctor, behind him.
  The win was Schanen’s ﬁ  rst as a collegian 
after redshirting last year with an injured hip.   Schanen sets course record as FSU tests runners

Countr y UF LOST 1-0 TO AUBURN 
ON A LAST-MINUTE GOAL.
By JESSE SIMONTON

For the second time in as many 
games, the No. 6 Gators were vic-
timized by a goal off a corner kick in the final minute. 
Friday night, Florida (10-2-2, 
4-1-1 Southeastern Conference) experienced déjà vu as it conceded the tying goal in the last minute of regulation for the third time this season. 
Sunday’s ending was different. 
They lost this time. 
Unlike the three previous games 
that resulted in a tie or win, Sun-
day’s error was the game’s only 
goal as Florida lost 1-0 to Auburn (9-5,3-3 SEC). 
In the 89th minute of what had 
been a scoreless draw, All-SEC goalie Katie Fraine misplayed the Tigers’ corner kick and the ball trickled past senior defender Nicky Kit and into the goal.  
“We just got outplayed. Flat out 
out-played,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “Whether the goal came in the 89th minute or the fifth minute, they had better chances than we did and they deserved to win.”
The Gators were on their heels 
for much of the second half as the Tigers continuously pushed for -
ward and thwarted any Gators at-tack.  Auburn outshot Florida eight to three in the second half. The Tigers nearly took the lead 
twice in a span of 30 seconds, but key plays by Fraine and the rest of the Florida defense preserved the shutout. 
In the 59th minute, Fraine blocked a one-on-one chance bare-ly more than 10 yards away from goal. Seconds later, Auburn had a corner kick and defender Jazmyne Avant and Kit deflected the ball from an empty net. 
While Fraine was out of posi-
tion, Avant used her knee to block the header and Kit slid over to clear the ball. 
Earlier in the game, in an at-
tempt to create more offense in a clogged middle, Burleigh moved center back Ashlee Elliott to strik-er.
“Their center backs were really 
sitting back deep so we thought putting a bigger body back there might occupy them more,” Bur -
leigh said. 
The coach also said it was only 
an in-game decision and that El-liott would be back in her usual role next weekend. 
Including Friday night’s 1-1 
draw against Alabama, Florida again struggled this weekend at finishing that final pass to create scoring opportunities. 
Midfielder Erika Tymrak cre-
ated several strong chances in the first half, but Florida failed to capi-talize on any of them. Too often 
the Gators had unforced turnovers 
that killed the attack. 
Sunday’s game was the second 
time this season Florida failed to score a goal. 
“We have one or two ways to go 
at this point,” Burleigh said. “We can get back to work, buckle down and go back to basics. We have to 
stick together or we’ll fall apart. 
We’ll really find out what we’re made of now.”16, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2010
