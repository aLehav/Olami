Gov. Rick Scott and his Cabinet voted 
last week to turn Ocala’s Silver Springs 
Nature Theme Park into a state park.
The lease on the land will now expire 
Sept. 30. In the meantime, steps will be 
taken to clean the springs and surroundings 
— a $4 million effort paid by current owner Palace Entertainment.
“We believe that turning over the park 
to the great state of Florida is in the best long-term interests of the park, its guests, the local community and the state,” wrote Palace Entertainment's water park division 
vice president Mike Friscia in an email.
The plans were drafted by the Florida 
Department of Environmental Protection 
following a public meeting in December focusing on the health of the springs and the animals that live nearby. 
The department will 
replace aged amusement park structures with 
environmentally friendly hiking and camping 
opportunities. A primary 
goal is to reduce nitrate 
runoff into the springs, which is allowing ecosystem-threatening algae growth.
A long-term plan for the park will need to be established by September 2014. 
Admission prices have not yet been 
decided, but current park passes will be honored for their duration.
The state park system and its private 
concessionaires will try to use the workforce already at the park where it is a viable option,  FDEP spokeswoman 
Jennifer Diaz wrote in an email.
However, Florida’s more than 160 
state parks generally depend upon a 
strong volunteer base of more than 6,000 members.
Ocala's Silver Springs to become a Florida state park� THE FLORIDA MUSEUM OF NATURAL 
HISTORY WILL FEATURE THE TITANOBA: MONSTER SNAKE EXHIBIT THROUGH AUGUST.

The largest snake that ever lived and king of 
the Colombian rainforest 60 million years ago, 
comes back to life as a full-scale, 48-foot-long 
model in the Florida Museum of Natural His-
tory’s newest exhibit.
The exhibit, Titanoboa: Monster Snake, 
opened on Saturday and will reside at the mu-
seum until Aug. 11. 
About 700 people attended the opening day 
activities, which included live reptile relatives 
of the fossils on display and a large Titanoboa puzzle on the front lawn. Admission to the ex-hibit is $5 for Florida residents and $4.50 for 
kids aged 3 to 17.
The exhibit, the result of collaboration be-
tween UF, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln 
and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, was originally on display at the Smithsonian In-
stitution in a much smaller form.
Because UF is the home of the original fos-
sils, as well as remains from several other rep-
tile species from the Cerrejon coal mine where 
Titanoboa was found, the team at the Florida 
Museum was able to turn the exhibit into an ex-tensive look at the larger ecosystem surround-Monster snake

Jake Kennedy closed shop two weeks 
ago with one box of 12-gauge shotgun 
bullets left.
Kennedy, owner of Gator Skeet and 
Trap Club, said he is always careful to 
keep 500 to 1,000 boxes of ammunition 
on reserve. But two weeks ago, he had to drive to Tampa at 5:30 a.m. to borrow ammunition from another gun range be-fore he could open at noon.
Since gun control stepped into the 
national spotlight following the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, Gainesville shooting ranges and gun shops have 
seen large jumps in business.
Last week’s proposed legislation 
would reinstate a ban on assault weap-
ons, limit magazine capacity to 10 rounds and expand mental counseling services, but that hasn’t slowed the inﬂ  ux of peo-ple buying guns and ammo.
Kennedy said the national conversa-
tion has drawn more locals — especially college students — to shoot at his range, located at 5202 NE 46th Ave.
Even though the legislation doesn’t 
deal with shotguns — such as the ones customers use to shoot targets at the club Gun industry booming despite new focus

Loaded grilled cheese sandwich-
es, squid gyros and barbecue eggrolls 
were among the many meals served 
Saturday at Gainesville’s first-ever 
Food Truck Rally.
The free event, hosted by Pelican 
Brothers Food Truck and Glory Days 
Presents, featured five other food 
trucks and four local bands.Four of the trucks, Pelican Broth-
ers Food Truck, Humble Pie, La Lola 
Loca and Go Go Stuff Yourself, were 
local vendors.
The two others, Off the Griddle 
and Grilled Cheese Wagon, were 
from Polk County and Williston.
The rally drew about 1,000 hun-
gry attendees who waited in lines 
that snaked through the parking lot. 
Customers cheered when cooks called their names and handed them food.
Kelly Chapman, a first-year UF 
graduate student, said her Pelican Brothers spicy aioli fries were well worth the roughly 30-minute wait.
“It’s fun to be able to come out-
side and do something like this,” she said. “It’s unique, it’s different and 
you can try a bunch of things.”
The variety the rally offered was 
what made it fun, customer Dave 
Eckel said. 
Vegetarian options were avail-
able at all of the trucks, and alcoholic beverages were offered inside High 
Dive.
“You’re not restricted to one menu 
like in a restaurant,” he said while 
eating chicken pad thai. “Here you can just go from truck to truck.”
Pat Lavery, a Glory Days Pres-
ents independent promoter, said the event was a hit. 
Based off the positive response, 
he expects the rally will return.
“Street food is non-traditional,” 
he said. “It’s on the fly, it’s DIY, and it’s kind of different and exciting. Hopefully we’ll keep it going.”

Daniel Gallagher, 25, and Gui Amador, 38, of Go Go Stuff Yourself, prepare 
food for customers at Gainesville’s first Food Truck Rally on Saturday night.
Feb. 1, 1973: After 65 years, UF’s student news-
paper officially became The Independent Florida 
Alligator, an independent nonprofit corporation. President Stephen C. O’Connell announced the final decision Jan. 9, 1973, marking the end of a long battle 
to gain editorial control of the newspaper. What were 
originally the kitchens for the College Inn underwent $5,000 to $6,000 in renovations to become the new home of the Alligator.
Jan. 29, 1966: The United States Selective Service 
announced it would be going back to a Korean War-type system for drafting, meaning thousands of male students who were at the bottom of their classes could 
end up in uniform the next Fall. During the Korean 
War, a student’s class standing or his score on a test determined whether his deferment would continue. Students had to take a full-time schedule of classes in order to defer drafting.
Jan. 28, 1997: UF student senators voted to amend 
their statutes to publish the budget after it had been passed. The decision was a result of a referendum 
in which more than 90 percent of students voted to 
see where the money goes. The amendment required summaries of the budgets’ line items to be published in the Alligator within 48 hours after passage and [two days before the deadlines] to submit budgetary amendments.
Jan. 28, 2005: Fifty Santa Fe Community College 
students took part in the college’s first Project Santa 
Fe Campus Change-Up. The event included beauti-
fication projects for the northwest campus, such as re-painting walls, planting shrubs and picking up trash.

customer– Kennedy said it is having a ripple ef-
fect on the industry.
“We’re up probably 15 to 20 per -
cent,” he said. “It just increases our business because people are more 
aware of firearms and want to come 
out and see it for themselves.”
Alex Rennert, co-founder of the 
Florida Gators Trap, Skeet and Sport-ing Team, said the team grew from 18 members to 30 members since the be-ginning of the semester.
Rennert, a 20-year-old UF aerospace 
and mechanical engineering sopho-
more, said the membership spike at the 
beginning of the semester coincided with the resurgence of the gun control issue and the time students typically join organizations.  
Rennert said the club, which com-
petes nationally, has helped some stu-dents view target shooting as an enjoy-able pastime in safe environments.
“People kind of realize you can 
have fun in shooting sports, and it’s not as dangerous as people make it out to be,” he said.
Gainesville gun shops are experi-
encing similar boosts in business re-lated to the proposed legislation.
For Dan Skinner, store manager 
of Lawful Defense Guns & Transfers, located at 9420 NW 13th St., it’s been hard to keep up with customer de-mands.
“People are coming in and buying 
whatever they can, which makes guns and ammunition very hard to acquire,” said Skinner, 28.
The proposal served as a push for 
those on the fence about buying a gun because many are afraid they won’t be able to buy one later, he said.
“An industry joke is that Obama is 
the No. 1 gun salesman of the year,” he 
said.
On Friday , Skinner said the shop 
was out of AR-15 semi-automatic ri-
fles, which is one of the guns targeted in the recent assault weapons ban.

After more than six weeks of being closed 
for renovations, Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sand-
wiches on West University Avenue will be re-opening today.
Bob Weygandt, general manager of the 
West University Avenue location, said every 10 years, each restaurant, including the one at 1724 W. University Ave., is required by its con-tract to go through renovations.
He said after the renovations, his restau-
rant will look similar to the Jimmy John’s res-taurant at 2220 SW Archer Road, which was remodeled during Summer.
The West University Avenue restaurant is 
smaller and will only have two serving lines, compared with the three lines at the South-west Archer Road location, Weygandt said. He added that his restaurant also traded its old cash registers for touch-screen computers.Before, restaurant employees had to write 
down customer orders on tickets, Weygandt said. Now, customer information will be saved on the computers for faster orders.
“It’s easier to serve the customer; it’s more 
efficient for the customer,” he said.
Dan Jaworski, general manager for the 
Southwest Archer Road restaurant, said when his restaurant started renovations in July , he sent employees to work at the West University Avenue restaurant. At one point, Weygandt’s store had about 60 people working at the same time, Jaworski said.
When the West University Avenue restau-rant closed, Weygandt said UF students and professors had to get their sandwiches from the Southwest Archer Road location.
While the temporary closing gave the 
Southwest Archer Road location more busi-ness, the closing had some hungry students looking for the sandwiches in Midtown wor -
ried.
Walking along West University Avenue 
Friday, Rachel Wick, a 20-year-old UF psy-chology sophomore, said she was happy the restaurant wasn’t permanently leaving.
“I saw that it was just being remodeled,” 
she said. “I was kind of happy about that.”

Science students clean and sort fossils at the expanded exhibit
ing Titanoboa when it was alive.
The exhibit features a recreation 
of the dig site, the fossil skull of a 
newly discovered crocodile, the 
shell remains from a turtle so large that a grown man could have rid-den on it with room to spare and an incredible little box with the 
vertebrae of an anaconda beside 
the vertebrae of Titanoboa, which is like setting a golf ball next to a softball.
In addition to the fossil dis-
plays, the expanded exhibit also features an active fossil prep lab staffed by geology and paleontol-ogy students who clean and sort 
new Titanoboa fossils that have 
recently arrived from Colombia.
Florida Museum assistant di-
rector for exhibits Darcie MacMa-hon said that the lab is designed to 
make the process of paleontology 
real to people who get to see sci-ence in action.
“It’s a lot of fun to watch them 
work,” she said, “and for kids who come in, it might make them think that maybe this is something they 
could do one day, too.”
Museum-goers start in the 
field, head to the lab and then end 
up with completed fossil displays and life-size replicas.
Ten-year-old Dominic George 
was there early with his family, taking in the replicas and watch-
ing the students work.
“It’s really cool,” he said about 
the Titanoboa model, “but I want 
to do the digging part.”
Titanoboa lived during the Pa-
leocene epoch in prehistoric Co-lombia, millions of years before humanity took its first steps. 
Florida Museum associate cu-
rator of vertebrate paleontology Jonathan Bloch said it was the largest land predator known to science for 20 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs.
“It was on a scale with that 
snake from the Harry Potter mov-ies,” he said. “The fossil record does this all the time. It exceeds 
the imagination of Hollywood all 
the time.”SnAke , from page 1STUDenT GOVeRnMenT

About 80 students quali-
fied and slated for Student 
Government elections on Friday in the Reitz Union, a 
larger turnout than the first 
day of qualifying and slating 
in Spring 2012.
Last year, 48 students 
qualified on the first day.
Prospective candidates 
must qualify to be able to run for a Student Senate seat. Par -
ties can interview, or slate, candidates who wish to run 
with their party.
Students Party Vice Presi-
dent Grier Ferguson said 19 
students slated with her party on Friday.
“Based on today’s turnout, 
I think Monday and Tuesday will be good days,” she said.
Ferguson said about 20 
to 30 people slated with the 
party in Spring 2012.
UF international studies freshman Anjali Goswami, 
19, presented her Gator 1 ID 
to qualify for a seat in the 
College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to represent the Stu-
dents Party.
“I just really believe that 
Students Party has a platform 
that repre-
sents stu-
dents like 
me,” she 
said.
S w a m p 
P a r t y 
spokes-
man Elliot 
Grasso said about 50 to 60 students slated with the party on Friday. 
He said the turnout was 
similar to Fall 2012.
Grasso said a diverse range 
of students, including transfer students and students with military backgrounds, slated 
with the Swamp Party.
“We’re gonna have a good 
group,” he said.Business freshman An-
drew Babcock said he quali-
fied for a sophomore seat to 
make an impact on the Stu-dent Body. 
Babcock, 19, said he slated 
with Swamp Party because 
he felt that they were better 
qualified for leading the stu-dents.
Qualifying will continue 
today and Tuesday in Room 
284 in the Reitz Union from 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m.
Students can interview 
with both parties but must choose one and inform Su-
pervisor of Elections Stephen 
Davis before qualifying ends. 
Each party can interview 
as many students as it wants, 
but the party can only choose 
50 candidates, for the 50 sen-
ate seats, to slate on the ticket
Students running as inde-
pendents don't have to be in-

Volunteers examine air potatoes after the 14th Annual Great Air Potato Round-Up on Satur -

When a 6-foot-4-inch, 325-pound 
man lowered his shoulder, trying to 
force his way through the locked door, Justin Woodall stayed calm and collected.
“Don’t escalate the situation, and 
don’t play to people’s emotions,” Woodall said. “The best thing I can try to do is calm them down.”
Woodall simply told the man 
that he got towed, so he has to pay.
Woodall works as a dispatcher 
for Superior Towing LLC, and he deals with customers as they pick 
up their cars at night.
He said as more students be-
come acclimated to their classes and 
schedules, he expects to see more of them on the other side of the glass window, arguing about why their car got towed.
“At the beginning of the semes-
ter, people try to get set in their 
ways, and [towing] doesn’t spike 
until people get comfortable after a while,” Woodall said.
After they get comfortable with 
their day-to-day schedule, he said, students start to make mistakes.
Adam Pages, a 21-year-old UF 
telecommunication junior, admits that he frequently takes risks, but he 
understands and takes the blame.
“Every time I have gotten towed, 
I knew there was a possibility of me getting towed,” he said. 
But UF international studies 
freshman Kat Anthony , 19, got her 
car towed two weeks ago, and she’s still fuming.
“Everybody is not happy when 
they’ve been towed,” Woodall said. “Everybody shows up, and they are not in a very good mood.”
Anthony could vouch for this, 
as she is still under the process of 
disputing a ticket she got.
The frustrating part, she said, 
was dealing with the towing com-
pany workers that took her car.
Woodall said some towing ser -
vices tend to act rudely to people, but his personal goal is to make it as easy as possible for the customer.
“I have them come up, under -
stand what the rules are, get them paid out and get their vehicle out of here as quickly as possible, so they have less to get mad about,” he said.
Companies like Superior Tow-
ing LLC are contracted by separate individuals like apartment com-plexes or spots on UF’s campus 
that they tow out of. Essentially , the 
companies are told by what guide-lines to tow someone’s car, which tends to be a student’s car.
“[Students] are the demographic 
that gets towed more than anybody because there are more of them here,” Woodall said.Towing increases as 
students toe the lineReader response

Did I mention Matt Damon is awesome?
No disrespect meant to Jimmy Kimmel, but my nor-
mal nightly routine is to go home from the library 
and wind down by not watching his show. 
If I watch TV , it’s almost always “Family Guy,” “Ameri-
can Dad” or whatever other more surrealist comedy Adult 
Swim happens to be showing that night.
That routine has always worked for me: I’ve never really 
missed anything that made me go, “Damn, I wish I’d been 
watching that,” until the other night when Matt Damon hi-
jacked his show.
For those of you who, like me, were busy with not watch-
ing Jimmy Kimmel and missed it, it was awesome. Go look 
up the clips on YouTube. No, seriously, right now. I’ll wait.
Seeing that spectacular display of “Damonity” made me 
realize that Matt Damon is our greatest American treasure. 
I know this is probably an unpopular opinion.
I’m sure some people are out there saying, “No way, 
man, it’s George Washington!” or “Dude, what about the 
Constitution?” or “Seriously? Have you not seen Rebecca 
Black’s ‘Friday’ video?”
Well, you are all entitled to your own opinions. They are 
wrong, but you can have them.
Matt Damon is THE American treasure. Let me just make 
a list for you here: “Good Will Hunting,” “Ocean’s Eleven,” the Bourne movies, “The Departed,” “Good Will Hunting,” 
“Dogma,” the episode of “30 Rock” where he pulled a gun on Liz Lemon, “Good Will Hunting.”
Hmmm. I seem to have listed “Good Will Hunting” 
three times. Hey, it’s not my fault!
Wait, actually, it … kind of is my fault. But I’m not going 
to change it. 
How do you like them apples?Anyway, there is a point to all this, other than just an-
noying everybody by giving myself an excuse to misquote a fantastic movie.
The other big pop culture story of the week was that they 
picked the director for the new Star Wars movie. And it was, 
to the surprise of no one except for maybe one Swedish guy 
who never saw “Lost” or the new Star Trek, J.J. Abrams.I’m not going to complain 
about the choice because I liked 
the new Star Trek. I am excited 
to see how he’s going to pull off 
something as monumental as 
STAR WARS F***ING SEVEN 
while he’s also working on a new Mission: Impossible and a “Clo-
verﬁ  eld” sequel, though.
There’s a reason I’ve men-
tioned these two seemingly unrelated things in the same space. I think you all see where I’m going with this.
Yes: John Wall fakes an injury, retires, then comes out of 
retirement to sign with the Jazz. Err, sorry, wrong crackpot 
pop culture scheme.
Yes: Matt Damon as Luke Skywalker’s son in “Star Wars 
Episode VII: We Bought A Space Zoo.” (The subtitle may need some work.)
I’ve been doing some thinking about this. Well, a little 
more than some.
OK, it’s all I’ve thought or talked about for the last three 
and a half weeks. My brother and both my roommates 
stopped responding to my texts about a week ago.
So here’s what I’ve come up with so far: We open on a 
shot of Matt Damon with a lightsaber. Then, roll end credits. I’m open to suggestions on what to put in the middle there. 
We might have to kill his character off (cf. Liam Neeson in 
“Episode I”), so he can work on his Bobby Kennedy movie 
and the “Tender Is the Night” adaptation he’s cast in with 
Keira Knightley.
Look, guys, I honestly didn’t know about the “Tender 
Is the Night” thing until I started researching (i.e., read-
ing Matt Damon’s Internet Movie Database page) for this 
column. That movie will be the combination of two of my 
favorite things in the world: F. Scott Fitzgerald and Matt 
Damon.
I’m too excited to write a coherent conclusion now.

Conundrum: 
Bonarrigo violates her 
own election codes
We’ve all heard stories of politicians breaking laws they originally passed.
Well, these incidents are not foreign to members of 
UF’s Student Government.
In May 2012, members of the Unite Party in the Student Senate 
revised the election codes, stipulating that “campaigning” could not occur until one week prior to the ﬁ  rst day of elections.
According to the SG Election Code (aka the 700 codes), cam-
paigning “means any intentional action in support of, or in op-
position to, a candidate or political party for an elective student body ofﬁ  ce, including, but not limited to the distribution of lit-
erature and posting of election speciﬁ  c materials.”
Election-speciﬁ  c campaigning includes things that say “vote 
for” or include the date of the election in tandem with a particu-
lar candidate or party.
Although this revision does not prevent people from wearing 
party paraphernalia such as T-shirts or buttons prior to this win-dow of time, it does prevent the wearing of campaign material if “accompanied by the dissemination of campaign literature or 
the delivery of a campaign speech to solicit support for a candi-
date or political party.”
On Friday, four weeks before the ﬁ  rst day of elections, Chris-
tina Bonarrigo publicly announced her candidacy for Student Body president for the Swamp Party. Bonarrigo was a member 
of the Unite Party when it passed these election code revisions.
In pictures from the event on the Swamp Party’s own website, 
Bonarrigo can be seen wearing a Swamp Party button, which is 
clearly campaign paraphernalia, accompanied by a speech to so-
licit support for herself. She also used election-speciﬁ  c language, 
implicitly asking attendees to vote for her in the upcoming elec-tion.
Not only did Bonarrigo violate the very codes her party sup-
ported last Summer, but her overall record in Student Senate has 
not been squeaky clean.
When Jason Tiemeier was initially accused of throwing away 
copies of the Alligator during the Spring election (to which he 
later confessed in a front-page letter to this newspaper), Unite 
Party ofﬁ  cials, including Bonarrigo, denied his involvement and 
accused the Alligator of making up the story.
When Tiemeier’s confession letter conﬁ  rmed that Katie Wald-
man was with him during the incident, Bonarrigo defended Waldman, saying she did not think Waldman’s failure to come 
forward after the incident was unethical, even while Unite Party 
members were accusing the Alligator of fabricating the story.
As the election season begins, do not forget Bonarrigo’s ethi-
cal failures and overall lack of class displayed during her time 
as a student senator. Bonarrigo has supported election code re-
visions hurting student free speech, while also defending those who engage in unethical activities.

opinions@alligator.org MONDAY, JANUARY 28, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 7
Here’s a fundamental fact: 
America’s best and most aggressive collegiate daily 
newspaper is the Independent Florida Alligator. It has stood the test of time 
and has been a force to be reckoned 
with in all the eras in which it has served.
I was selected to serve as the editor 
of the Alligator for 1971 to 1972. Then, the newspaper operated out of the Reitz Union, and it was tethered to UF by a modest but significant financial stipend derived from student activity 
fees. The Alligator was dependent on 
UF for those fees, though it had a robust level of advertising. That connection did not deter the newspaper from regularly “biting” UF administration on a variety of issues.  
The seminal issue of my time — and 
the controversy that forever changed the newspaper — was about both 
the First Amendment and abortion. 
Abortion was banned by Florida’s state legislature in 1868, when an abortion information ban also was enacted.
Early in my tenure as editor, 
we interviewed women who had undergone legal — and illegal — abortions. We prepared a comparative 
sidebar story on state abortion laws. 
We compiled a list of counseling services that could help guide women — and the list actually included the Catholic Student Center, surely not apt to encourage any woman toward abortion.
John Parker, a brilliant law student 
who wrote a popular editorial page 
feature, “Fluted Columns,” offered 
an unsolicited “legal” opinion: Publication of the list would be a felony — a violation of that 1868 statute, 797.02, that prohibited anyone from any activity to hint, print or advertise for an abortion.
Such an old law seemed both 
archaic and unconstitutional. We 
had  wanted to print the counseling 
list before we learned it was “illegal.” After Parker’s legal lesson, we only wanted to print it more.
Because the Alligator received a 
subsidy from UF, we were considered an official “organ” of the university, with the UF president technically the newspaper’s publisher. Stephen C. 
O’Connell, a proud Gator alumnus 
who had gone on to a stellar legal career capped by service as chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court, was our UF president throughout my undergraduate years.
We were asked to submit the entire 
controversy to the Board of Student Publications — the governing agent 
of the Alligator at that time — and we 
were willing to abide by its decision. Surprise: We prevailed with a 4-3 vote to allow publication of the list, with all four students voting our way.
That’s when O’Connell intervened, 
visiting me to overrule the board and prohibiting publication. I left that meeting inclined to disobey 
O’Connell’s edict and to print the list 
anyway.
A strategy meeting was hosted by 
now-retired UF journalism professor Jean Chance at her home with her then-husband, attorney Chuck Chance (who later defended me from criminal charges related to this incident). 
A few key student leader friends, 
all of whom tried to discourage publication of the list out of concern for the consequences likely to confront me, also were there. Weighing their shared perspective against all the lessons I had learned about the meaning of the First Amendment, I 
told them we were going to go forward 
with publication for a principle more important than the risks.
The “illegal” counseling list was set 
for the front page. But our Ocala printer declined to print the list. Instead, he allowed some text to explain the most famous block of front-page empty white space ever to grace the Alligator 
or any other campus newspaper.
I asked my friend, then-Student 
Body President Don Middlebrooks 
(now an acclaimed federal judge) if we could mimeograph 22,000 copies of the list on Student Government’s equipment. He agreed — but insisted on paying for the printing costs personally.
In the Alligator newsroom that 
evening, our entire staff divided up copies of the mimeo sheets in a felonious conspiracy to stand up for the First Amendment. I signed the master copy of the counseling list, with my signature appearing at the bottom of the 22,000 copies, so that no harm would come to others or to the 
newspaper.
Our commando team of young 
journalists skulked about campus 
to await delivery of the Alligator to boxes outside classroom buildings and stuffed every newspaper with the list.
Chuck Chance, joined by UF 
constitutional law professor Fletcher 
Baldwin, defended me. The need for 
their services was immediate, as State Attorney Eugene Whitworth sought my felony arrest the same day.
I was given a mug shot, 
fingerprinted and mocked by a jailer whom I had written about a year earlier in an Alligator exposé of the county jail that followed the newspaper’s 
investigation of an inmate’s murder 
that was made to look like a suicide. 
My  arrest made national news 
and was the buzz at many campus newspapers. Considered no flight risk, I was released on my own recognizance.
A few hours later, O’Connell held a 
news conference. He announced that 
if convicted, besides a possible year in 
prison, I would face certain firing as Alligator editor and likely expulsion.
Then, O’Connell surprised us all 
by announcing a double jeopardy: He would seek an advisory opinion from Florida’s attorney general, Bob Shevin, about whether the UF president could exercise prior restraint to stop 
publication of any particular matter. 
If the answer were yes, I would be removed as Alligator editor and would still face UF disciplinary action because I had disobeyed his command NOT to publish.
Chance and Baldwin strategized 
my defense. My parents and I received dozens of letters from strangers, many 
of them anonymous threats of violence, 
and some calling me “Satan’s boy” or the “baby-faced baby killer.”
Shortly before my trial, Shevin’s 
office rendered its answer to O’Connell’s question in an opinion written by young lawyer Barry Richard, now one of the nation’s most respected legal minds — the attorney 
who represented the campaign of 
George W. Bush in the disputed 2000 presidential race. Basically, the attorney g e n e r a l ’ s office said no 
to O’Connell — no prior restraint over the college newspaper. Although the opinion had no force of law, it was a huge victory for the Alligator and other campus newspapers — but a serious rebuke and embarrassment for O’Connell, the former chief justice.
Merely days later in December 
1971, Alachua Judge Benmont Tench 
(yes, he is the father of a namesake son 
who is a founding member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) held court on my felony charge.
Chuck Chance and Fletcher Baldwin 
were brilliant, well-researched and articulate in their arguments that F.S. 797.02 was wholly unconstitutional. The courtroom gasped as Judge Tench 
declared that old law unconstitutional. 
But it wasn’t over yet.
Chance and Baldwin then had the 
temerity to actually challenge Florida’s equally old 1868 anti-abortion law. Again, they argued about the law being unconstitutional. No one expected what came next: Judge Tench struck down Florida’s existing abortion 
law, which had stood for 103 years. 
Ultimately, the Florida Legislature was forced to rewrite the law, loosening its restrictive provisions on an issue that continues to divide Floridians — and Americans — to this day.
Meanwhile, this double rebuke 
of authority clearly did not sit well with O’Connell. We had rejected 
his authority on this issue, even 
embarrassed him, merely by standing up for the First Amendment. We also prevailed in his dominant province — the law and the courts.
Shortly thereafter, O’Connell 
announced plans to force the Alligator from the campus — cutting off student-fee support for it, though 
some funds flowed in the form of 
limited guaranteed advertising. It was a temporary modest lifeline that was eventually cut off. Thus was born the Independent Florida Alligator, now celebrating a good chunk of the newspaper’s 100-plus years of service.
The smart, tough and earnest 
young journalists who have labored 
in the Alligator newsroom throughout 
its history never have considered it a mere classroom or sandbox. They have considered it a mission to inquire and to inform and, inevitably, to rankle the powerful by the newspaper’s very nature. 
It is now, as always, a feisty and 
vigorous watchdog.
The Alligator remains the best 
college newspaper in the country, despite continued challenges, conflicts and controversies. 
For those of us who have worked 
there — and for the tens of thousands who have been its readers — we wouldn’t want it any other way.

Speaking Out
Tuesday marked the 40th anniversary of the Su-
preme Court’s ruling in the case of Roe v. Wade. The verdict utilized the due process clause of 
the 14th Amendment to protect a woman’s privacy re-garding the right to choose. Roe v. Wade and a concur -
rent case, Doe v. Bolton, addressed the lack of clarity in state laws regarding abortion access.
The decision made in Roe v. Wade attempted to rec-
tify the complication of two key interests with regard to pregnancy termination: women’s health and prena-tal life. It was established that women should have full access to abortion services until fetal viability. Since we have become accustomed to the issue of choice, the ter -
minology of the decision lacks so much specificity that attempts at defining “life” have become prevalent.
For instance, viability is relative to each pregnancy 
and cannot be applied in a universal manner and is complicated by conceptions of personhood, as shown in attempts at limiting Mississippi’s Initiative 26. Such are the issues that arise in motions to regulate and en-force the inherent nuances of pregnancy. We have seen efforts aimed at clarifying these problems through the legal system in successive cases brought before the Supreme Court, including Webster v. Reproductive 
Health Services, Planned Parenthood v. Casey and 
Gonzales v. Carhart.
As we attempt to coalesce 
action regarding an issue with 
two main interest camps main-
taining their own distinct per -
spectives on the issue, we will 
continue to encounter issues of clarity and complications 
of enforcement. The values with which the groups ap-proach abortion, when applied rigidly, are mutually exclusive of each other.
The valuation of prenatal life over the health of 
the woman, for one, excludes considerations for the woman’s particular circumstances. The arrival at the decision to abort is deeply personal, and regulation of access to abortion services, if any, should respect this agency. This respect for individual authority is an is-sue that needs to be further articulated and discussed in the public sphere as a uniting valuation we can ap-ply to the many, multifaceted issues that manifest in our modern society.
Many are concerned with the possible actions and 
subsequent consequences in response to the cases pre-viously mentioned. This inability to come to a compro-mise on the situation is causing a new, wider rift in our country and people’s political allegiances.
The problem is never going to disappear, and the 
women who are affected by the possible outcomes and interpretations of new laws face a daunting prospect. Women across the country who have aborted will gain a new stigma in the event that anti-abortion rights sup-porters have their way, and those who revile women for discarding the budding life within them will be seen as criminals by the people who reserve the right to govern what happens within their own bodies.
Unfortunately, it seems inevitable that either way, 
someone is going to be left offended and nursing their ideologically driven anger.
What impacts this will have in 10, perhaps 20, years 
in the future are as-of-yet unknown until one standard is implemented. But hopefully, the next few genera-tions will not be as offended at our indiscretions as we were to hear about how doctors once “treated” the mentally ill or how unyielding many previous genera-tions were in accepting the reality of evolution.

Off in the distance, a trumpet sounded. 
A man dressed colorfully in yellow, red and 
blue fluttered through the crowd on stilts.    
Shops with names like St. George’s Drag-
on Orphanage and Ye Olde Wizards and Dragons lined a long dirt road. From their stores, vendors sold crowns, shields, swords 
and wands.
This is a glimpse into the 27th Annual 
Hoggetowne Medieval Faire that took place 
this weekend at the Alachua County Fair -
grounds in northeast Gainesville.
“Our community loves the Hoggetowne 
Medieval Faire,” said Linda Piper, events coordinator for the City of Gainesville De-partment of Parks, Recreation and Cultural 
Affairs. “The Medieval Faire has one of the 
best reputations in the South, so people come from all over.”
Piper said about 140 volunteers helped 
run the event, while about 160 artisans sold 
different goods, ranging from incense sticks 
to candles. In addition, nearly 100 enter -tainers performed on eight stages, which 
included knights jousting and reenactors 
fighting.
Among the attendees dressed as fairies, knights and princesses, Kent Brush shouted 
at people from his store, The Roasted Nut 
House, telling them about his selection of nuts.“Nuts, nuts, nuts,” he said to passers-by, 
“gotta come get some nuts.”
Brush, 45, said he sold all kinds of nuts, 
from almonds to cinnamon-roasted to “old,  redneck, completely insane nuts.”
Brush got involved in the fair through 
the Society for Creative Anachronism and has attended the event for 25 years.
“I love to be a freak among freaks and 
not be labeled anything else,” he said.
David Buth, 47, is a 20-year veteran of 
the festival. This year, he dressed up as an orc named Agog. His costume consisted of a movie-grade latex mask, colored contacts, a black tunic, chain armor, black gloves, a 
spear, shackles and a pair of boots. All to-
gether, it took him about 30 minutes to put on his costume.
Next year, he hopes to be a magician for 
the fair, creating illusions for attendees.
Lindsay Stewart, a 24-year-old self-de-
scribed “professional elf,” sold costume ac-cessories from a booth, transforming several humans to elves with simple sets of elf ears.
Stewart said she travels across the coun-
try attending Renaissance festivals. Satur -
day’s event was her second year at Hog-getowne.
“It’s a cute little fair,” she said. “It’s nice 
and small and has a lot of action.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 28, 2013

Murphree Hall will host the new Continuing in Hon-
ors Living Learning Community for 30 UF Honors Pro-
gram students this Fall.
“I’m excited about this,” said Honors Program direc-
tor Kevin Knudson. “I think this will be another extra 
thing that we can offer our students and can enhance 
their experience here at the university.”
Continuing in Honors is a joint effort between the 
Honors Program and the Department of Housing & Residence Education targeted toward sophomores and upperclassmen.
Diane Porter-Roberts, associate director of housing 
for Student Learning & Engagement, wrote in an email that about 600 students live in the Honors Residential 
College at Hume Hall, but they’re mostly freshmen.
“Sometimes Hume can be more of a freshman place 
where you go one year, and then you try to find some-
where else to live,” said Joseph Ziebelman, a 24-year-old mental health counseling master’s student and graduate hall director for Murphree Hall.
Knudson and Porter-Roberts are working together 
to keep older students involved in honors activities.
Although the details have not yet been solidified, 
Knudson said it will offer residents advantages like ad-vising, socials and close proximity to the honors office at the Infirmary.
“I think we want to respond more to what the stu-
dents might want,” he said. “Let them tell us what kind of level of programming they might be interested in.”
Knudson said spots filled up a few hours after hon-
ors students were notified about the community. There is now a waiting list.

Subway’s famous footlong isn’t mea-
suring up, and its headquarters is taking 
action.
A shift supervisor at the Gainesville  
Subway at 5210 NW 13th St., Ric Lasley, 
21, said headquarters asked every Sub-
way restaurant to measure and photo-graph random loaves of bread to ensure the subs are a full 12 inches.
Lasley said he sent about 20 photos 
to headquarters last week. The subs were all 12 inches long.
The issue arose earlier this month 
when a photo went viral online of a 
footlong sub next to a ruler, revealing an 11-inch sandwich, Lasley said.
Two men from New Jersey sued 
Subway Tuesday for false advertising, 
saying Subway has been cheating them, according to the Associated Press.
Aubrey Grant, a 19-year-old UF 
health education and behavior sopho-
more, said he wants the men to admit 
they don’t care how long the sandwich is and just want money.
“You know the sandwich tastes 
good,” Grant said.
Grant said he’s eaten at Subway for 
10 years and wouldn’t care if a footlong only measured 10 inches.
“When I see a big, ginormous sand-
wich, I know that it’s going to fill me up, so I don’t really care if it’s 12 inches,” he said. “I care about the quality of food and how good it is.”
Lasley said people have been coming 
in and asking for an 11-inch sub. He said 
they all think the inch-inspired uproar 
is ridiculous. They request 11 inches in jest, he said, so he replies in jest.
“That’s all we have, sir,” he said.The bread comes ready to be baked, 
so no employee could accidentally put too little bread in one sandwich, Lasley said.
Lasley said he thinks the case could 
go either way.
If the men win, Subway might re-
name their products as a half or whole sub, he said. Or they could add an as-terisk, clarifying that it may not actually be 12 inches.
“A ‘Footlong’ is just a registered 
trademark,” he said. “It’s not depicting the size of the bread. It’s just a name.”Subway foots responsibility in controversy

Meghan Burke, a 22-year-old UF marketing senior, was 
shocked to learn that the Gatorade she was enjoying at the 
Hub contained an ingredient banned in other countries for health reasons.
“Wow,” she said. “It makes me wary. If they’re taking it 
out of their drinks in other countries, they should take it out of American drinks.”
They listened.In a statement last Friday, Gatorade spokeswoman Mol-
ly Carter said that the company has decided to remove the controversial ingredient from its sports drinks after “hearing rumblings” from its customers. UF, which developed Gato-rade in 1965, receives 20 percent of the royalties from sales of the drink.
Brominated vegetable oil is an ingredient in Gatorade 
Orange that allows the citrus flavor to be distributed evenly . Mountain Dew, Fanta Orange, Fresca and Powerade also con-tain the ingredient.
When consumed in excessive quantities, research has 
found that brominated vegetable oil can build up in the body and in breast milk. The chemical has also been linked to neu-rological impairment, reduced fertility and changes in thyroid function, according to the New York Times.
It is illegal as a food additive in the European Union, India, 
Brazil, Japan and Canada.
It remains legal in the U.S. on an “interim 
basis pending additional study ,” according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Its interim status has lasted 36 years.
Renée Goodrich-Schneider, an associ-
ate professor in UF’s department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, said she is 
comfortable consuming the oil because it 
doesn’t harm people at the levels at which 
it is typically consumed.
“We all have access to the same data, but we all don’t make 
the same decisions based on that data,” she said.
Keith Schneider, an associate professor in the same depart-
ment, said the incidents of illness from the oil are extremely rare and caused by excessive consumption.
“It is generally regarded as safe,” he said. “They were 
drinking four to eight liters a day of this stuff. If you drink 
that much of anything, you’ll be in the emergency room.”Gatorade to remove oft-banned ingredient“I love to be a freak among freaks

Eight a cappella groups sold out  
UF’s Auditorium on Saturday night 
for the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella 2013 Tour -
nament.
Saturday’s quarterfinal competi-
tion was the first round of the IC-CAs, organized by Varsity Vocals.
Florida State University’s all-
male group, Reverb, and UCF’s Gemini Blvd. will be the two groups advancing to the regional semifi-nals.
UF’s No Southern Accent won 
third place and best choreography. They sported red shoes, and the group sang songs from Alex Clare and The Killers, earning them a standing ovation, along with some Gator chomps.
The Staff, an all-male group from 
UF, also competed. 
This was the first time that the 
competition was held at UF.Audience members included a 
cappella enthusiasts and fans of the 2012 film “Pitch Perfect.”
Danielle Amols, 20, a member 
of FSU’s All-Night Yahtzee, was an extra in “Pitch Perfect.” Amols said she spent three days with her a cap-pella group in Baton Rouge filming the semifinals scene.
“This [competition] will be a 
reality check; “Pitch Perfect” is a 
glorified version of a cappella,” she 
said.
South Producer for Varsity Vo-
cals Lindsay Howerton said the 
groups that usually win can sing 
and dance simultaneously .  
“The groups that generally win 
are the ones usually doing the most 
innovative things,” she said.
The winning performance was a 
dance revival of boy bands from the past two decades, beginning with the classic “This Is How We Do It.”   
“I thought we did well, but there 
were so many good groups that I 
didn’t know how we would do,” 
said Reverb member Eric Glaze, 20. “It feels absolutely breathtaking.”State a cappella groups sing way into spotlight at competitionlocAl

A Gainesville homeless shel-
ter is closing its doors this March 
after a local charity announced it wouldn’t renew a one-year agree-ment to manage the house.
As a result, five women and 
several children living at the Arbor House, located off Northwest Sixth Street, must find new homes.
The house, which has served 
as a shelter for homeless pregnant women for 30 years, will be shut-ting down in the next two months after years of close calls.
Funds have dried up for the struggling organization, which was 
propped up last year by a donation 
agreement from the Gainesville Re-gional Office of Catholic Charities.
The agreement said Catholic 
Charities would help fund the shel-ter for one year as it looked for more long-term ways to sustain itself.
Due to cutting costs itself, Cath-
olic Charities decided not to con-
tinue management responsibilities 
after the agreement ends in less than two months, said John Barli, the regional director of Catholic Charities in Gainesville. 
He could not say exactly when 
in March the house would close.
The home provides transitional housing for the mothers, as well as 
support programs and courses fo-
cused on job and interview skills.
“People had time to actually 
figure out what they were doing,” said Theresa Lowe, director of the 
City of Gainesville/Alachua Coun-
ty Office on Homelessness.
The house has filled a niche in 
the Gainesville community, and in terms of long-term housing for 
women with children, there isn’t 
much else available, she said.
“Other people who are in the 
same situation won’t have that as a resource,” she said.
It takes $250,000 to operate the 
shelter each year. Even though some of that money comes from county grants, donations from local 
churches and Catholic Charities, 
the house struggled to break even.
Catholic Charities, which serves 
five counties in North Central Florida with food and adoption programs, is itself also fueled by grants. 
The organization helps pay for the women and children’s medical 
bills and birthing costs.
“Donations are still down, and 
the grants aren’t sizeable enough,” 
Barli said. “There’s just not enough sustainable income.”
Even fundraising can’t put a 
dent in the day-to-day costs of run-ning the home, Barli said.
Three of the women have in-
fants ages 2 to 4` months, and two women are due for delivery in the next couple of weeks, Barli said.
“The ladies are the No. 1 pri-
ority, and obviously the decision was a last-ditch thing,” Barli said.  “We’ve made every effort to make this work.”

They wanted to breed the perfect citrus 
fruit: bigger, better and sweeter than any that 
had come before it.
Almost a decade later, Chunxian Chen and 
Frederick Gmitter Jr., researchers at the UF Cit-
rus Research and Education Center, developed 
a new strain of grapefruit that is more appeal-ing in both look and chemical composition.
“The flesh is a very nice red, and it really 
smells like a grapefruit,” Gmitter said, “but it’s sweeter, less sour and has very , very low levels of the chemical that causes ‘grapefruit effect.’”
The grapefruit effect is an adverse interac-
tion between chemicals in common medica-tions, including those for high blood pressure, antidepressants and birth control, and furano-coumarin, a chemical found in grapefruit.
Chen, a UF citrus geneticist, said that the 
chemical interaction causes high concentra-tions of the medicine to stay in patients’ blood-streams.
Gmitter said if they eat grapefruit, people 
taking these medications are “risking the likeli-hood of having dangerous side effects.”The reality of the grapefruit effect is hard to 
swallow for many patients who once enjoyed 
the fruit.
The researchers said their newly discovered 
grapefruit strain, UF 914, is a safe alternative 
for people taking such medications because the strain contains low levels of the chemical.
The development of UF 914 is also good 
news for students with an aversion to the com-monly sour fruit.
Gator Citrus Club president Katie Rogers, 
a 21-year-old horticultural science junior, said in the club’s past citrus sales, “We always sell about half as many grapefruits as oranges.”
But the availability of the new strain may 
cause some to change their minds about grape-fruit.
“I’d definitely buy [UF 914] to try it out,” 
said Matias Gonzalez, a 24-year-old UF alum-nus. “If it tastes sweeter, then I can substitute 
grapefruit for other less-healthy snacks.”
Gmitter and Chen said their next step is 
conducting human clinical trials to confirm the 
strain is safe before it reaches stores.
“The biggest challenge is ahead of us right 
now,” Gmitter said.UF to produce sweeter fruit

THE MOST POPULAR SITES.

A recently released Pew Research 
Center study found that 35 percent of 
adults use the Internet to specifically look up medical conditions they or someone they know might have.
Student Health Care Center Market-
ing Coordinator Catherine Seemann said college students are not exempt from this trend. She said the SHCC even mentions it at Preview as a “sort-of joke.”
“We say don’t Google symptoms be-
cause it will tell you that you’ll die,” See-mann said.
She said although it’s easy to look up 
medical issues online, it is easy to find in-formation from non-reputable sources.
The SHCC website has an area for 
“Health Care Information Online,” which links to pre-approved medical information sites that are updated regu-larly. Popular go-to sources like WebMD and the Mayo Clinic are included on the list, as well as other government-spon-sored sites.
Seemann said the difference between 
using verified sites and ones just found online is the difference between “the En-cyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia.”
Shelby Grossman, a 19-year-old tele-
communication sophomore, said she uses the Internet with caution. She said her sister used online resources to look up symptoms relating to diabetes. Her sister went to a doctor, who confirmed the disease. Grossman still thinks people should go to a doctor in the end.
“If you’re looking it up, you might as 
well go to the doctor,” she said.
Coral Sprague, a 20-year-old recre-
ation, parks and tourism junior, said when she thought she had strep throat recently , she went to a Walgreens clinic before she went online.
“Too many people rely on the Inter -
net,” she said. “The Internet isn’t a doc-tor. It shouldn’t tell you what’s wrong 
with you.”New study finds adults look 
to Web for help diagnosing“Other people who are 
in the same situation won’t 
have that as a resource.”

Junior center Patric Young dunks during Florida’s 83-52 victory against Missouri on Jan. 19 in the O’Connell Center.
� YOUNG IS AVERAGING 
11.8 POINTS PER GAME IN CONFERENCE PLAY.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
 
With 18:18 remaining 
and Florida up by 22 points 
against Mississippi State on 
Saturday, junior point guard 
Scottie Wilbekin lobbed the ball to Patric Young for a right-handed, alley-oop 
slam.
The dunk put an exclama-
tion point on Young’s night.  
Young scored 13 points 
on 6-of-6 shooting as the No. 8 Gators (16-2, 6-0 Southeast-
ern Conference) defeated the Bulldogs for an 82-47 win in Starkville, Miss. 
His perfect night from 
the field propelled Florida to 55.4 percent shooting and a 68 percent clip on two-point field goal attempts. 
“He got some putbacks, 
did a couple nice post moves and did some really, really good things around the bas-ket,” coach Billy Donovan said.
“He gave us a great lift 
of energy to start the second half as well.”
Young posted on his Twit-
ter account (@BigPatYoung4) Friday: “knees hurt so bad I can’t sleep at night.” But he showed no sluggishness on Saturday.
In 27 minutes, he recorded 
two blocks and grabbed six rebounds, including four on the offensive end.
On two of his offensive boards, Young followed through to score putback layups. 
Saturday’s contest did not 
begin smoothly for Young. He went without a field goal attempt during the first 8:06. 
But when the Bulldogs (7-11, 
2-4 SEC) keyed in on him in the post, the Gators’ perim-eter opened up.
During Young’s score-
less span, UF made 4 of 8 at-tempts from behind the arc. 
“It was hard for him when 
he got the ball to really do 
much,” Donovan said.
“He made some great 
passes out to the perim-
eter, and he got some of our guards shots.”
When Mississippi State 
began increasing its focus on perimeter defense, Young broke free. 
As Florida closed out the 
half on a 21-11 stretch for a 41-19 lead, Young scored nine points — eight coming in the paint. 
“Once they take one thing 
away, they have to worry and account for something else,” Young said.
“When our guards start 
knocking down shots, it Junior becoming offensive threat in paint

Following an unsuccessful 
three-game homestand that saw 
Florida lose each contest, the Gators 
traveled to Athens, Ga., looking to 
regain momentum.  
Instead, their recent tailspin 
only grew worse.  
UGA’s Tiaria Griffin scored 10 
of her 12 points in the first 8:37 of the game, and No. 14 Georgia sent Florida reeling to its fourth con-secutive loss with a 69-52 victory 
in Stegeman Coliseum. 
Each of the past seven meet-
ings between Florida and Georgia 
had been decided by nine points or 
fewer, but it became obvious early 
in the game 
that Sun-day’s con-test would 
not be an-
other com-
petitive installment in the rivalry.  
Georgia (17-3, 5-2 Southeastern 
Conference) used separate first-half runs of 18-4 and 15-6 to take a 39-20 lead into halftime. UF did not have enough offense — an ongoing trend during conference play — 
and trailed by more than 20 points 
for much of the second half.
The Gators used a 17-4 run in 
the final 6:35 to shrink the deficit, 
but the Bulldogs had full control 
throughout the game.
“We did a really poor job of 
executing,” coach Amanda Butler said. “Georgia is a tough team to 
play.”
Florida’s previous four SEC 
losses came by an average of 6.3 
points per contest, but poor shoot-
ing and questionable decision-
making plagued the Gators. UF shot just 34.4 percent in the game while turning the ball over 17 times. 
“We’re just a little bit out of 
sync right now,” junior forward Lily Svete said. “But we have a lot that we can still accomplish, so 
we need to keep our heads up and 
keep playing hard.”UGA hands

This isn’t your typical Florida baseball 
team.
Gone are the home runs. Small ball is in.
Catcher Mike Zunino, the nation’s fourth-
best home-run hitter, is heading to spring 
training with the Seattle Mariners. Right fielder Preston Tucker, Florida’s all-time 
RBI leader, is with the Houston Astros.
Nine players left UF for the Major Leagues in 2012. A young team with a 
freshman shortstop in Richie Martin and an 
18-year-old catcher in Taylor Gushue is left.
Second baseman Casey Turgeon returns 
after a stellar freshman season.
Starting pitchers Jonathon Crawford and Karsten Whitson give the Gators reliable 
starting pitchers every Friday and Satur -
day.
“Everything as far as recruiting is con-
cerned has always been pitching and de-fense,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “I do feel good about that. I do feel good about 
our offense, but there is going to be some 
ups and downs. There’s going to be a learn-ing curve. We certainly have the personnel to be OK.”Youthful Gators playing ‘small ball’ in 2013See HoopS, p Age 15

Falling behind was something new 
for Florida.
But the Gators were not going to be-
come familiar with losing on Sunday .  
No. 12 UF (4-0) put together a 4-2 
comeback victory against UNC-Wilm-
ington (3-1) to advance to the ITA National Indoor Championships next month in Seattle. 
“It was a true test for us at this stage 
for where we are at,” coach Bryan Shel-
ton said. “I thought that they came out 
and punched us right in the mouth right off the bat.”
After coasting to victory in doubles 
during Saturday’s 7-0 win against St. John’s, Florida lost its first doubles point of the season on Sunday . 
With the score 4-4, the Gators’ No. 3 
doubles pair — Stephane Piro and Bob van Overbeek — failed to take the lead 
in the deciding point, giving the Sea-
hawks’ duo of Michael Reilly and Kaue Pereira the 5-4 advantage. From there, UNC-Wilmington won three straight points to earn an 8-4 victory in the first doubles match.
Florida’s No. 1 doubles team nearly 
duplicated the result. The 45th-ranked 
Gators pair of Mike Alford and Flo-
rent Diep took on the 10th-ranked Sea-hawks’ duo — Kosta Blank and Chris Cooprider. At 4-4, the Seahawks took the lead and didn’t look back, winning 
8-5.
Winning easily in Saturday’s match 
8-1, Gators duo Billy Federhofer and 
Gordon Watson led their match 7-4 be-fore it was halted when the Seahawks clinched the doubles point. 
 “We didn’t want to lose focus or get 
down,” Shelton said. “One of the things we have done well is we have come out and play good singles. We felt like we would come back and rebound in the 
singles.”
Florida started singles play with a 
victory. Federhofer defeated Pedro Mol 
in straight sets 6-1, 6-2. 
Minutes later, however, Seahawks’ 
No. 37 Rafael Aita defeated No. 26 Flo-rent Diep in straight sets 6-4, 6-3.Linder Stadium fell silent after Diep, 
the Gators’ top singles player, lost. 
But redshirt freshman Watson 
stepped up under pressure to beat UNC-Wilmington’s Kosta Blank 6-2, 
6-4, which tied the match at 2-2. 
Down 3-0 in the third set, van Over -
beek battled back to win 6-1, 2-6, 6-4. 
The Gators, nursing a 3-2 lead, needed a victory from either Alford or Piro. 
“It was nerve-wracking, but at the 
same time, when you’re down like that, 
you know you have to win,” he said. 
“It’s not hard to find motivation to keep playing when you’re down like that.”  
Serving 40-15 on match point, Al-
ford crushed the ball into Pereira’s ser -
vice box, causing him to hit it into the net, clinching the victory and a trip to the ITA Indoor Championships for the Gators.
“Moving on creates more opportu-
nities to play against quality teams,” Shelton said.
“I hope that we are a different team 
come three months from now when we are looking at the SEC tournament and NCAAs.”Florida remains unbeaten with close winAfter leading the nation in home runs 
last year, the long ball will be hard to come 
by in 2013.
With a power-filled lineup last season, 
running wasn’t a priority. Florida ranked fifth in the Southeastern Conference with 66 stolen bases.
“Last year, you came up to the plate, and 
everybody could probably hit it out when-ever they wanted,” Turgeon said. “This year, it is going to be different.”
Turgeon, who said this is the fastest 
team he’s been on, has no problem with the change of pace.  
Florida will place a greater emphasis on 
stealing bases after losing its top five home 
run hitters during the offseason. 
“It is going to be small ball,” Turgeon 
said. “A lot of moving the runners. We are 
not going to hit the ball out a lot. We will still get our fair share, but this year, there 
will be a lot of guys running; a lot of guys 
bunting. We’ll do it all.”
Vickash Ramjit will step up to fill the 
leadership void left by the nine departing 
Gators.
In addition to serving as team captain, Florida will rely on Ramjit to help anchor 
the lineup.
After facing mostly lefties in platoon roles earlier in his career, Ramjit will play every day either at first base or in the out-
field and bat in the middle of the order.O’Sullivan would rather have Ramjit at 
first, saying Friday that he believes the se-nior has the potential to be one of the best 
defensive first baseman in the nation.
“We obviously are going to play our 
game,” Ramjit said. “We are not going to try and go out of our element. Stay within 
our element and that will make us more 
successful.”
Ramjit, one of two seniors on the team, 
does not know what to expect from the 16 
new players.
Neither does the rest of the country. 
Florida opens the season ranked 17th by 
Baseball America and 24th by Collegiate Baseball.
When Florida hosts Duke on Feb. 15 at 
McKethan Stadium, there will be several new faces in the batting order and a new Friday night starter.
“We have had some great players 
come through here that have moved on,” O’Sullivan said.
“Now it’s time for these players to make 
a name for themselves. They’ve worked 
extremely hard and we’re anxious to get 
started.”

Of the offensive struggles, Butler said: 
“Still trying to get back in the groove and get Jennifer (George) in her regular minutes and feeling comfortable and confident.”
George was one of four Gators who 
scored 8 points, but UF had no scorers in double figures. She made 4 of 7 shots as she continues to recover after suffering two 
dislocations to her right shoulder earlier in 
conference play. 
Junior Jaterra Bonds was left question-
ing her team’s resilience following an 88-81 loss to Ole Miss on Thursday in the 
O’Connell Center, and she was equally dis-
pleased three days later.
Bonds came into the game as the third-
leading scorer in SEC play averaging 17.8 
points per game but was held without a 
field goal in the first half. She finished the game with just six points on 3-of-10 shoot-ing, her worst offensive output since being held scoreless against Savannah State on 
Dec. 20.
Defense was equally troubling for the 
Gators, who allowed Georgia to shoot 43.1 
percent from the floor. Jasmine Hassell led 
all scorers with 13 points, as the Bulldogs 
benefited from a Gators defense that was often out of position and seemingly con-fused. 
After Sunday’s loss, Florida (13-8, 2-5 
SEC) is three games under .500 in confer -
ence play for the first time since defeating Vanderbilt 74-69 on Feb. 25, 2011 to move to 6-9 two seasons ago. 
“It feels bad to have lost four in a row, 
but again, we’ve got a really, really tough league,” Butler said. “We’ve got to get it back together and get our heads screwed on right and just play with more overall de-
termination.”
A radio broadcast contributed to this report.

With the 6-foot-9, 249-pound junior’s 
presence in the paint, Florida held Missis-sippi State to 37.8 percent shooting on two-pointers. 
“I’m just trying to anticipate and think, 
‘How can I help my teammate? How can I help us get this stop?’” Young said. 
Young is tied with senior guard Mike 
Rosario as Florida’s third-best scorer in 
SEC play with 11.8 points per contest. Dur -
ing the past six games, Young has shot 70.7 
percent.
Although most of his attempts this sea-
son have come within feet of the basket, Young stepped out of his comfort zone Sat-urday. 
With 4:39 remaining and UF owning a 
75-44 lead, Young attempted a shot from the left wing with a Bulldogs defender in his face.
Surprisingly, the baseline jumper found 
net. 
“I’ve been working on it,” Young said. 
“It’s about time I started expanding my game a little bit, right?”

Florida’s vault routine highlighted 
its 197.65-196.025 victory against Au-
burn on Friday night.  
Four gymnasts registered a score 
of 9.9 or above as the Gators pieced to-
gether a 49.625 — the second-highest 
vault score in program history . 
As a result, UF recorded a season-
high 197.65 to seal its third victory of the year. 
“[Friday’s] lineup was probably 
the strongest one we’ve had,” fresh-man Bridget Sloan said. “I know this is only our fourth meet but it was defi-
nitely a great lineup.” 
UF topped its 49.375 mark set 
against LSU on Jan. 18 and fell shy of 
the program record by .025.  
Coach Rhonda Faehn has yet to set 
a permanent lineup, but Friday’s vault rotation was undoubtedly the Gators’ best ensemble this season.  
Heading into Friday’s meet against 
No. 18 Auburn, F l o r i d a was av-e r a g i n g 
49.342 on its vault routine. However, the Gators pinned a 49.625.
Faehn employed a lineup con-
sisting of Sloan and All-Americans 
Ashanee Dickerson, Marissa King and 
Kytra Hunter. The four combined for a score of 39.75 — the highest mark set by four Florida gymnasts this season. 
It was only the second time that 
all four — King, Hunter, Dickerson and Sloan — were featured on vault together. Faehn used an almost identi-cal rotation against LSU as UF posted 
a then season-high 49.375 on vault. 
“We definitely picked up more 
stuck landings, and it showed,” Faehn 
said. “It made a difference in the over -
all energy because everyone feeds off of that.”
Florida’s ability to produce high 
vault scores has certainly fueled higher final scores. Against Missouri, 
Florida registered a 49.325 vault score, 
leading to a season-high 197.3. 
Friday night was no different. Florida built upon the energy of 
sophomore Kiersten Wang, whose 9.875 score was her season-best mark. King nailed her first stuck land-
ing of the season on vault, landing a Tsukahara layout with a full twist for a 9.925.
Faehn was satisfied with King’s 
performance and suggested that rep-etitions would eventually help the seven-time All-American.  “[King] finally put one in which 
was great because the first couple of meets it was just a matter of getting used to doing [vault] again in compe-
tition season,” Faehn said.

The Gators left the Razorback Invitational in Fayetteville, 
Ark., on a high note. The UF women edged out LSU by one 
point to earn a win. The Gators finished second in the men’s field with 79.5 points. 
Florida earned good results thanks to its depth on both the 
men’s and women’s teams.
Of the eight events in which the women placed in the top 
three, seven were comprised of juniors and underclassmen. The two seniors that placed — distance runners Mandy Per -
kins and Lanie Whittaker — teamed with two juniors to finish first in the distance medley relay.
Freshman sprinter Kyra Jefferson had a strong showing, 
placing first in the only two events she participated in: the women’s individual 200m on Friday and the women’s 4x400 
relay on Saturday.
“We talk about that a lot, how the [4x400 relay] is the last 
thing people see at the meet, and it’s what they remember 
you by,” coach Mike Holloway said. “We always try to put our best foot forward with the relays, and our women did a tremendous job.”
The men also boasted impressive youth and depth.Underclassmen accounted for both of the Gator men’s 
event victories. Freshman Ryan Schnulle won the individual 
800m, and sophomores Dedric Dukes and Hugh Graham 
Jr. and freshman Arman Hall made up three-fourths of the Gators’ victorious 4x400 relay squad. 
“I think our [4x400 relay] guys did a great job today,” Hol-
loway said. “Leo (Seymore) stepped in for Najee Glass, just like he stepped in for us last year [during the outdoor season], and he was fantastic. He’s a real team player, and you can always count on him to step in and step up when you need him.”
From the Crimson Tide Indoor Opener and the Gator Invi-
tational combined, Florida won 17 events with 13 of those vic-tories coming from underclassmen. Only one senior won an event — thrower David Triassi took the men’s weight throw at the Gator Invitational on Jan. 17 in the O’Connell Center.
This weekend, the Gators will split up to compete in both 
the Frank Sevigne Husker Invite in Lincoln, Neb., and the New Balance Collegiate Invite in New York City.
“I think we’re ready to get back to Gainesville and get back 
to work,” Holloway said. “We need to be humble and stay hungry for what’s ahead, but I couldn’t be more proud of the effort we put forth this weekend.”Gators women’s
