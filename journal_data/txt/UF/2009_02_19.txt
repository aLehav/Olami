At a time when many profes-
sors can’t even print syllabi for stu-
dents because of budget cuts, UF is spending nearly half a million dol-lars to install wireless Internet in the common areas of dorms. 
However, according to Sharon 
Blansett, assistant director of hous-ing for marketing, public relations and research, the $400,000 that will fund the first phase of a three-part installation comes from a reserve fund specifically designated for such housing projects. 
According to Azfar Mian, direc-tor of housing for administrative services, the UF Department of Housing and Residence Education is a self-supporting operation that generates revenue from rent, not the university. Every year, the department sets 
aside part of its revenue into a spe-cial reserve fund to pay for large renovation projects such as roof and window replacements and 
UF to use housing reserve to fund wireless

Gainesville has dodged the worst of the 
economic downturn so far, aided by the sta-
bility that Shands and UF provide, accord-
ing to Jenny DuRant, a chamber of com-
merce spokeswoman.“We’ve been fairly insulated by the edu-
cation and health care industries,” she said.
UF and Shands, the top two employers 
in Gainesville, have a combined workforce of 27,000, according to the chamber’s Web site.
In addition, UF and Sante Fe Communi-
ty College have 60,000 students who spend money in the community.
“There are other businesses in 
Gainesville, but comparatively 
they are much smaller,” said 
Stan Geberer, an associate of Fishkind & Associates, a finan-cial consulting firm.
Connie Aguilera, owner of Simply Gor-geous gift shop, agrees that these institu-tions protect the local economy. 
“There are the universities and the hos-
pitals, and then everything else spins off of that,” she said.
But Aguilera still feels the downturn.She stocks her shelves more carefully, UF and Shands shield Gainesville from economic woesBy CHELSEA KEENAN

Eight election complaints were presented and voted 
on Wednesday night during a two-hour Student Govern-
ment Elections Commission meeting. 
The Progress Party racked up four more campaigning 
complaints, submitted by Sen. Sam Miorelli of the Orange 
and Blue Party and Frank Bracco of the Keg Party, while 
the Unite Party had two filed against 
them.
However, Progress Party President 
Josh Simmons felt the complaints were 
petty and unnecessary.
“I don’t understand what good it 
does to drag me here on a Wednesday night when a simple phone call or Face-
book message could be made.”
Stephen Lawson, the commission 
chairman, said this election cycle has seen the most com-
plaints ever filed before an election.
“This is the most hotly contested election I’ve seen,” 
Lawson said. “Parties are feeling more threatened than in the past.”
Four complaints were voted as violations, one  was 
dropped and the other failed to meet the definition of a 
violation by vote. 
Matt Martz, a graduate student running as an Indepen-
dent for a Senate seat, was recommended for disqualifica-
tion and fined $10 after he refused to remove a Facebook group, which the commission voted a misrepresentation of the Unite Party.Parties present

Slain chimp's owner now says it wasn't on Xanax
STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — As authorities considered crimi-
nal charges, the woman whose 200-pound domesticated chimpan-
zee went berserk and mauled a friend backtracked Wednesday on whether she gave the animal the anti-anxiety drug Xanax.
Sandra Herold said Wednesday that she never gave the drug to 
her chimp, who was shot dead by Stamford police Monday after he grievously wounded Herold's friend Charla Nash. 
However, Herold said in an interview on NBC's "Today" show 
that she gave Travis the drug in some tea less than five minutes be-fore the attack. The chimpanzee's rampage forced Herold to stab her beloved pet with a butcher knife and pound him with a shovel.� UF center

Obama throws $75 billion lifeline to homeowners 
MESA, Ariz. (AP) — President 
Barack Obama threw a $75 bil-lion lifeline to millions of Ameri-cans on the brink of foreclosure Wednesday, declaring an urgent need for drastic action — not only to save their homes but to keep the housing crisis “from wreak-ing even greater havoc” on the broader national economy.
The lending plan, a full $25 
billion bigger than the adminis-tration had been suggesting, aims to prevent as many as 9 million homeowners from being evicted and to stabilize housing markets that are at the center of the ever-worsening U.S. recession.
Government support pledged 
to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is being doubled as well, to $400 billion, as part of an effort to encourage them to refinance loans that are “under 
water” — those in which homes’ 
market values have sunk below the amount the owners still owe.
“All of us are paying a price 
for this home mortgage crisis, and all of us will pay an even steeper price if we allow this crisis to con-tinue to deepen,” Obama said.
The new president, focusing 
closely on the economy, in his first month in office, rolled out the housing program one day after he was in Denver to sign his $787 billion emergency stimulus plan to revive the rest of the economy. And his administration is just now going over fresh requests for multiple billions in bailout cash from ailing automakers.
Wall Street has shown little 
confidence in the new steps, de-clining sharply on Tuesday be-fore leveling off after Wednes-day’s announcement. The Dow Jones industrials rose 3 points for the day.
Success of the foreclosure res-
cue is far from certain.
The administration is loosen-
ing refinancing restrictions for many borrowers and providing incentives for lenders in hopes that the two sides will work to-gether to modify loans. But no one is required to participate. The biggest players in the mort-gage industry temporarily had halted foreclosures in advance of Obama’s plan.STATE
Florida smoker’s widow gets $8M in damages 
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. 
(AP) — Philip Morris was or-dered by a jury Wednesday to pay $8 million in damages to the widow of a smoker who died of lung cancer in a case that could set a standard for some 8,000 similar Florida lawsuits.
The six jurors deliberated 
over two days before return-ing the award for Elaine Hess, 63, whose husband Stuart Hess died in 1997 at age 55 af-ter decades as a chain smoker.
The award amounts to $3 
million in compensatory dam-ages and $5 million in punitive damages against Richmond, Va.-based Philip Morris USA, a unit of Altria Group Inc. Hess’s attorneys sought up to $130 million.
“It wasn’t about the money 
from the beginning,” Hess said after the verdict. “It was about doing the right thing. I just really hope this can help all the thousands of families who have also suffered.”
The Hess case was the first 
to go to trial since the Florida Supreme Court in 2006 voided a $145 billion class-action jury award in the so-called Engle case, by far the highest puni-tive damage award in U.S. history. The court said each smoker’s case had to be decid-ed individually merits, but let stand that jury’s findings that tobacco companies knowingly sold dangerous products and hid risks from the public.
To be included in those 
findings, smokers or their families had to file individual lawsuits by Jan. 11, 2008.
Altria, the Philip Morris 
parent, issued a statement calling the Florida legal proce-dure “profoundly flawed” and predicted the damage awards would be reduced or thrown out on appeal.
“We plan to challenge the 
verdict in the trial court and, if necessary, on appeal,” said Murray Garnick, an Altria Cli-ent Services vice president and associate general counsel. “We do not believe today’s verdict is predictive of the outcome of future cases.”
The next case begins Thurs-
day before Broward County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Streit-feld, the local self-styled “to-bacco judge” who has about 350 tobaccco trials on his docket. Others are pending throughout the state.WHAT’S HAPPENING

Gainesville elections
By eMil Y FUGGetta
Alligator Writer
With two open commission seats 
and two proposed charter amend-
ments on the ballot for the upcom-
ing city election, voters have a lot to 
wade through on their way to the polls.
First-term incumbent Scherwin 
Henry has one opponent for his District-1 seat — Marcia Wimberly, whose Web site says she wants to address city revenue shortfalls while creating jobs and businesses.
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, who is serv-
ing her first term as an at-large com-missioner, faces four contenders — Tom Cunilio, Robert Krames, James Schlachta and Richard Selwach.
Cunilio, a substitute teacher and 
UF graduate, said his top priorities are homelessness and transporta-tion. He wants to reduce emissions 
by making Gainesville more trans-
portation friendly, he said.
Schlachta, a UF graduate and 
employee of the Florida Museum of Natural History, describes himself as a fiscal conservative and said he is committed to wise city spending. He wants to improve city traffic and 
boost safety downtown.
Selwach, a self-described liber-
tarian and owner of a pawnshop in 
downtown Gainesville, said that his 20 years of business experience and 30 years as a Gainesville resident qualify him.
Selwach said he wants to im-
prove the city’s water supply, an 
area he thinks has been ignored by 
the current commission.
He also wants to create a zone 
with lockers and portable toilets where homeless people can stay for a few days before moving on. He said he wants to send Gainesville homeless back to where they came from.
“We’ll take care of you for a few 
days while you get on your feet,” he said. “And then I’m buying you a bus ticket out of town.”
In 2007, Selwach was arrested on 
charges that he knowingly sold sto-len national championship rings. He was found not guilty. Krames, a 26-year-old Web de-
signer, said that the most important issue facing Gainesville is a discon-
nect between the current commis-
sion and city residents.
“I think that our current elected 
officials have not been open to pub-lic input as much as they could be,” 
he said. “They’ve basically done what they wanted to do.”
Krames also 
plans to deal with mismanagement of city funds, he said.
“We’ve got 
roads that are falling apart,” he said, “and at the same time, we’ve got these beautiful water fountains.”
Mastrodicasa, who also serves 
as UF’s vice president of student af-fairs, hopes to keep her seat in the commission to further efforts in en-ergy conservation, community stan-dards for local bars and looming city budget constraints.
Mastrodicasa said that she is al-ways happy to speak with students because their participation is essen-tial to local government. She added 
that students are often ignored be-
cause they do not vote.
“Even when they’re down here 
fully opposing something I’ve led, I’m very excited that they’re partici-pating,” she said.
If Charter Amendment 1 passed, 
Gainesville would lose the right to prohibit discrimination based on 
qualities such as gender identity and 
sexual orientation. 
Mastrodicasa is the only candi-
date in the At-Large race to oppose Charter Amendment 1.
She said the amendment would 
permanently prevent Gainesville from making changes on the dis-crimination issue. It would also 
remove the city policy that gives 
job preference to veterans and local businesses preference over corpora-tions.
Selwach said he supports pass-
ing the amendment. “I’m all for ev-erybody’s rights and stuff like that, but it needs to be brought to the state and federal level — not at the local level at this time,” he said.
Charter Amendment 2 would re-
quire voter approval  before the city sells land used for conservation, rec-reation or cultural purposes or uses it for another purpose. Mastrodicasa supports the amendment.
Krames said he would oppose 
requiring a vote.
“We should be able to trust the 
city officials to decide,” he said.
 Schlachta, Selwach and Cunilio 
were unfamiliar with the proposal.
Supervisor of Elections Pam Car-
penter said she hopes that the turn-out will mirror that of November’s presidential election — in which 81 percent of Alachua County residents voted — but expects turnout to be lower, as is typical of local elections.
Voters can determine their dis-
tricts by calling the Supervisor of Elections or checking their voter registration cards.
Feb. 23 is the last day of voter reg-
istration. Early voting begins March 16. The regular election will be held March 24.
Voters have plenty to decide before local elections

He pushes the sawed-off top half of a 
Canada Dry 2-liter into a container of wa-
ter, forcing smoke into his lungs.
While this marijuana wasn’t any more 
expensive than usual, one-eighth of an 
ounce for $60, he is just one of many who 
continue to blow smoke in the face of an ailing economy.                    
Drug use is normally not affected by 
economics.
But one change is that police have 
cracked down on drug dealers, convinc-ing many leave the business. Drug deal-ers believe that police are trying to meet 
higher quotas and make more money.                   
This results in more dealers going un-
der, said a student smoker, and it can be 
expensive finding a new one, since deal-ers usually charge new customers more.                                                                             In addition, dealers and buyers agree, the introduction of digital scales into the sale of marijuana means that the customer gets the exact amount that they pay for.
Traditionally, preferred customers 
may receive a bag of marijuana with a bit extra.       
“Unfortunately, drugs are recession-
proof,” said Gainesville Police Depart-ment spokesman Keith Kameg.
Although the country is seeing ups 
and downs with the economy, Kameg 
said GPD usually doesn’t see upturns or 
downturns with marijuana sales and us-
age.
“People with an addic-
tion will do anything they can to get money to support their habit,” he said.
Kameg said that in most cases, drug 
users are the ones who are committing 
auto and residential burglaries.
“People aren’t breaking into cars to 
get money for pizza,” he said.
In a business that has no legal safe-
guards, the increase in violence associ-
ated with the economic downturn can be dangerous for dealers.
“Fuck the police, I’m more scared of 
the jackboy,” said a man who has been 
dealing for decades and has experience with being held up.
The increase of violent crime has 
forced him to start carrying a firearm for 
protection, he said.
With police, a dealer may lose their 
entire stash and a lot of time and money dealing with litigation. With thieves and competitors, a dealer may lose their life, he said.
As the economy worsens, Kameg said 
people turn to selling marijuana because it is quick and easy money.
“Often times people think that they 
are one huge drug deal away from be-ing the next Warren Buffet,” Kameg said. “But in reality, they are one big drug deal away from going to prison.”
Kameg predicts student drug use will 
stay steady throughout the recession.
Students who attend a state university 
have money for drug purchases, Kameg said. He said that not only are students using drugs, but they are also selling.
“Our biggest fear for student drug 
dealers is home invasion robberies,” he said. “They are not aware that some of the people they are dealing to will hurt 
them if given the chance.”  By JESSALYN BERGER

B. Lee Green, vice president of the Office 
of Institutional Diversity at the Moffitt Can-
cer Center in Tampa, spoke about the differ-ences between racial classes and their health on Wednesday.   
Though his speech focused mainly on 
health issues, Green took time to joke with the crowd. 
More than 100 people, mostly students and 
professors, attended Green’s speech, held at the Florida Gym.
The event was part of the Florida Center 
for Health Promotion Speaker Series, co-spon-sored by UF’s Department of Health Educa-
tion and Behavior to coincide with Black His-
tory Month. 
Green was selected because of the success 
of his research with health disparities and be-cause of UF’s link to Moffitt, according to Jill Varnes, co-organizer of the event. 
Moffitt and UF, as of last year, have en-
gaged in an energizing and growing relation-ship, said Dean Steve Dorman of the College 
of Health and Human Performances.
During his speech, Green said there is a 
racial gap in mortality rate, even in early life 
stages. Blacks have double the infant mortality rate compared to whites, he said. But at age 85, there is an equal mortality rate between whites and blacks.  
One problem, Green said, is the percentage 
of  whites and blacks who have cancer, which 
has not changed since 1981. He said more 
blacks are affected because fewer seek medical care due to cost. 
Sadie Sanders, a UF professor of human 
sexuality, required her graduate students to attend the lecture.
“All these diseases that he talked about, di-
abetes and cancers, they affect the overall body which in turn affects human sexuality,” Sand-
ers said. “I wanted my students to see that.”  
Marissa Wheeler, a student in a class taught 
by Varnes, was also required to attend.
“The huge differences in disparities are a 
hard thing to fix,” Wheeler said. “The work he 
is doing will benefit everyone.”
Dr. Green was paid between $100 and $500 
to come to UF, in addition to his travel expens-es. 4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2009

Student Government presidential candidate Sen. Ben Dictor, left, of the Progress Party, 
answers a question while Orange and Blue Party candidate Sen. Mark McShera, right, takes notes during a debate on Turlington Plaza on Wednesday afternoon.

Alligator Writer
Three of the students running for Student 
Body president had their say Wednesday in 
the third and final debate hosted by The In-dependent Florida Alligator and UF’s Col-lege Republicans. Candidates were publicly 
questioned in Turlington Plaza with the aim 
of educating students before the Feb. 24 and Feb. 25 Student Government elections.
Candidates from the Orange and Blue Par-
ty, the Progress Party and the Unite Party of-fered suggestions to improve issues affecting UF students. The Keg Party did not partici-pate. The debate was moderated by College 
Republicans member Kate Rapp.
Candidates offered solutions that may aid 
with increasing SG’s transparency and ac-
countability after the private e-mail scandal between top SG officials last fall. 
Progress Party candidate, Ben Dictor, and 
Orange and Blue Party candidate, Mark Mc-Shera, advocated an improved SG Web site, which would allow Senate voting records to 
become available to students. Both candidates 
said this would allow students to know if their senators are representing their interests. 
“Right now we can’t hold them account-
able to their actions,” Dictor said.
McShera agreed, adding SG’s exclusivity 
has added to students’ political apathy.
“If students can’t see what’s going on, 
why should they care about Student Govern-
ment?” he said. 
Another highlight of the debate was when 
candidates addressed the Student Body presi-
dent’s role as an acting member of the Board of Trustees, UF’s highest governing body. 
All candidates agreed this responsibility 
should not be taken lightly.
“You have to voice the needs and concerns 
of students,” said Jordan Johnson, the Unite 
Party candidate, “returning the value back to 
the students as quickly and effectively as pos-sible.”Candidates talk responsibilityGuest links

Friends and classmates are mourning 
the loss of UF graduate student Shannon 
Kane, 22, who died in a car accident on 
Monday.
Kane began pursuing a degree at UF 
in wind conduction in the fall. She earned 
her undergraduate degree in music edu-cation from Syracuse University. 
Kane’s boyfriend, Michael Ubbens, 
was driving when the eight-car pile-up occurred early Monday morning on I-75. 
Ubbens, who attends Susquehanna 
University in Pennsylvania, was visiting Kane for  Valentine’s Day weekend.
“They knew each other since kinder-
garten,” said Erin Cushing, a friend. “It was a soulmate situation. She loved him so much and was so proud of him.” 
One thing everyone remembers is her 
smile. 
“When I had a bad day, I would see 
her smile and bam, it fixed it,” said Mi-chael Miller, a close friend of Kane.
Marc Payton, who met Kane last se-
mester, compared her smile’s warmth and innocence to that of a child meeting Mickey Mouse during his or her first trip 
to Disney World.
A teaching assistant for UF’s bands, 
Kane also lead the Women’s Volleyball 
pep band.  
“She was a great musician,” Miller 
said, adding Kane played the flute. The two met at Syracuse University.
“She had a beauti-
ful sound,” said Cush-
ing, who met Kane the 
first day of band camp during the summer. 
Payton, who has 
been involved with 
the pep band for more than four years, often helped Kane find last 
minute substitutes before performances.
“She was very professional,” Miller 
said. “She was able to walk the line be-tween teacher and peer. She was always someone everyone looked up to because she was real.”
Payton said Kane’s absence was no-
ticed immediately.
“She will be missed deeply in the 
school of music,” he said.
Kane was a talented flautist, but she was also a hardworking student. 
“She raised the bar for all of the mas-
ter’s students,” Cushing said.
Friends called her study habits me-
ticulous.
“Shannon was on the verge of having 
OCD,” said friend and fellow teaching assistant Chelsea Negray with a laugh. “Everything had to be perfect; it would get on our nerves.” 
Along with her love of music and 
school, Kane had a love of sweets.  
“She always made me laugh because 
she would always eat her cookie first, be-fore the rest of her lunch,” Negray said. 
“Given the choice between eating 
something healthy or a cookie, she would eat the cookie,” Cushing said.
However, Kane’s selflessness, kind-
ness and optimistic nature will be missed most. 
“I was grateful I got to know her,” Ne-
gray said in a voice choked with emotion. “It’s really true what they say: it’s better to have loved and have lost than to never have loved at all. My life would have been so mundane without her.”

UF’s Common Reading Pro-
gram revealed the title of its re-
quired book for freshmen on Wednesday on the Plaza of the Americas.
This year the committee of 20 
students, faculty and staff chose “The Devil’s Highway” by Luis Alberto Urrea, the true story of 26 illegal immigrants who cross the Mexican border and get lost in the Arizona desert.
The Common Reading Program 
has been distrib-uting books to incoming fresh-men at Preview 
since 2007, and has incorporated the titles into English, engineering 
and first-year Florida classes.
“We want to engage students 
in discussion about service, the 
privileges they have and social re-sponsibility,” said Leslie A. Hahn, assistant director of New Student Programs.
The program is also planning 
events for the fall that will focus on the book, including panel dis-cussions, faculty lectures, movie screenings and a visit by the au-thor.

Some of Gainesville’s specialty 
card stores’ sales dropped in 2009, despite Valentine’s Day, causing some store owners to close their doors for good.
Sue’s Hallmark is packing up and 
shutting down due to lack of busi-ness, store owner Larry Stephens said, blaming the poor economy.
Stephens has owned the card 
shop for five years. It will close at the end of February.
Sales have plummeted since last 
year, he said.  Although Valentine’s 
Day has consistently been the store’s 
largest day of card sales each year, Stephens couldn’t offer as large a card selection this year and had to slash prices.
“We sell a lot more than cards,” 
he said.  “It’s the gifts, too.”
Lynn’s Hallmark has also been 
struggling, but owner David De-Longy plans to keep the store open.
“Our cards, not just Valentine’s 
Day, but everyday greeting cards, have taken a hit because we don’t have the number of people willing to take the trip to the mall,” De-
Longy said.
Shoppers opt to go to the drug-
store or to Publix as a matter of con-
venience, he said.
This year’s Valentine’s Day card 
sales for the store were about 13 or 14 percent lower than last year’s sales, he said.  Other items such as stationery and packaging for gifts 
have experienced similar drops in 
sales.
“The Internet a few years ago 
took its toll, but it’s the economy right now,” he said.  “It’s strictly economic and political fear.”
Many Gainesville consumers 
look for the bargain when it comes to greeting cards.
Gainesville resident Debby Ch-
erwak, 55, has made greeting cards for friends and family since she was a teenager.  
For Valentine’s Day this year, 
Cherwak made cards for her family by using a computer program to im-port photographs and add personal-ized messages.

Mason, 19, said price is the most important factor when she shops for cards.Card store sales flopUFAcademic sThe views expressed here are not necessarily those of the  Alligator .

Cartoon’s racist overtones 
are unacceptable
A quick glance at Wednesday’s edition of The New York 
Post revealed that racism remains alive and strong in Amer-
ica.
On Page 12 of a paper known for publishing little more 
than tabloid fodder, cartoonist Sean Delonas depicted Presi-
dent Barack Obama as a monkey getting shot to death by two 
white police officers. In the cartoon, the speech bubble reads, “They’ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.”
Excuse us? You’ve got to be kidding.According to an article in The New York Times, Col Al-
lan, editor-in-chief of The New York Post, attempted to deflect negative attention surrounding the drawing by contending the cartoon was nothing more than a satire of an incident in Con-
necticut in which a crazed monkey was shot to death.
OK, sure – the Editorial Board buys that, but why the hell 
did it have to include anything about the stimulus. Please, sir, 
do tell us how the cartoonist could rationalize tying the death of a monkey to the passage of a bill meant to fix the economy – without exuding blatant racist overtones.
Instead of taking the opportunity to concede the utterly dis-
tasteful nature of the cartoon, Allan proceeded to call out the Rev. Al Sharpton for publicly criticizing the cartoon as an act 
of shameless self-promotion. We think it is downright disgust-
ing that Allan had the gall to berate Sharpton when in reality it was his publication and employee who were in need of a seri-ous gut check. Sure Sharpton may be guilty of loving himself a bit too much, but who can blame him for calling attention to a gross miscalculation on the part of The New York Post?
There is no fine line that Delonas attempted to walk by de-
picting President Barack Obama as a monkey in his cartoon. Simply put, you just don’t do that. In a time in which the coun-
try can put aside its checkered past to elect a black man to the 
highest office in the land, why can’t a run-of-the-mill cartoon-ist refrain from equivocating a budding American icon to a chimpanzee?
What makes the situation even more disturbing is Delonas’ 
track record for drawing cartoons that lack any semblance of sensitivity and foresight. From mocking same-sex marriages to featuring a politician kissing Sharpton’s butt, Delonas’ past behavior has teetered on the unacceptable. Clearly, Delonas 
cannot try and hide behind the guise that he only meant to 
illicit laughter and amusement when his portfolio is shrouded with controversy. 
It doesn’t matter if you’re an ardent Obama supporter or 
if you voted for the other guy; a society that deems a cartoon featuring a symbolically racist image OK clearly needs a his-tory lesson. Sure former President George W. Bush was often depicted on editorial pages as a monkey, but among the many differences between him and Obama is the fact that his skin is 
white. Drawing a black man as a chimp or gorilla must never 
be confused with a comedic device – rather, it is nothing more than a hateful jab at an entire group of people. 
Delonas’ actions cannot simply be swept under the rug 
with hopes that he can go back to drawing cartoons without facing repercussions. Blatent acts of racism such as this cause division and uproar that is completely inexcusable. The black community has fought too hard for their equality, and Delonas must be held accountable for his truly unsavory trangression.
While The New York Post is hardly the second coming of 
The New York Times, we sincerely hope Col Allan can find it within himself to own up to the shortcomings of his cartoon-ist with a hint of class, rather than dismissing this inexcusable act.
Tolerance for such  archaic ideology conjures imagery of our 
country’s racist past that no longer has a place in America.Ah, Student Government election season. 
And it couldn’t have come at a better time. The 
battle over the “porkubus” stimulus bill is over, 
President Barack Obama is sending more troops into Af-
ghanistan to fight the war on terror, and newspapers are calling on Sen. Roland Burris to resign in light of new cor-ruption scandals. Conservatives don’t have much else to 
write about.
Not that SG is much to write about, either. Yes, SG 
controls a sizable budget, but unfortunately the lasting 
implications of any decision they make are just not that significant. Congresses are inherently slow moving, inef-
ficient and wrought with compromise.
Obama’s stimulus bill, for example, was originally sup-
posed to be about $100 billion larger and include a great 
deal more government spending. Despite overwhelming 
support in both houses, the final bill ended up watered-
down and littered with pork-barrel spending.
Like it or not, this is the way government was meant 
to function. The people who wrote the Constitution feared government rather than trusted it to solve all of 
their problems. They sought a slow-moving Congress 
that couldn’t infringe on their rights in the same way as a super-efficient English tyrant.
For those of us who still don’t like government, this 
slow movement keeps government subordinate to the people. We don’t want a government that will immedi-ately respond to every little problem in America rather than let people and the market sort out their own prob-lems. My favorite words in the  Constitution are the first 
five of the First Amendment: “Congress shall make no 
law.”
So why do we expect SG to be any different?Even the SG campaigns are 
just as bad as the real-world ones. Mudslinging has been 
rampant, especially in pithy 
tactics like those employed by the Orange and Blue Party in filing otherwise trivial com-
plaints against the Progress 
Party.  
The Orange and Blue 
Party campaigned last fall and spring on the promise of 
change, and its most significant accomplishment was the resignation of a Gator Party senator. The Progress Party promises “insourcing” that aside from being a socialistic idea reminiscent of protectionism at the expense of effi-
ciency is fairly unfeasible for any minority party to ac-
complish in the current SG establishment. The Unite Party promises that everything will be great if we just “unite.” 
Will it happen? We shall see…So for the upcoming SG election, I endorse your 
friends. Vote for the people you know are running and who would be capable legislators. Don’t waste your time voting down the party lines hoping for any real sort of change from anybody. Everyone will give you more of 
the same – more bickering, more twiddling, and more mi-
nor legislation with little if any lasting benefit.
No matter how much people try to stop it, SG is still 
government, and government is inevitably going to screw up. So have fun campaigning, good luck if you’re run-
ning, and stop asking me to vote for your party.

Letter to the Editor
Column overlooks Chavez’s positives
As a close observer of the massive social 
transformation currently taking place in 
Venezuela right now, I take issue with Eric Chianese’s column Wednesday. Media pun-dits love to paint Hugo Chavez as a dictator, but look at the facts. 
Chavez has been re-elected several times 
with landslide majorities (garnering 60 to 70 percent of the vote) in elections with mas-sive turnout, which international election monitoring agencies called clean, open and fair. 
When Chavez was overthrown by a mili-
tary coup orchestrated by rich oligarchs of Venezuela (with CIA support), he was suc-cessfully returned to office by the working people of Caracas, who surrounded the 
presidential palace and deposed the illegiti-
mate government. 
Chavez pardoned the plotters, despite 
their crimes against the Venezuelan consti-tution. Does this seem “thuggish”? Chianese 
says Chavez has a “Stalinist cult of personal-
ity,” yet any honest observer should see no 
difference between Chavez’s popularity and 
the recent “Obama mania.” No term limits? France and Great Britain also have no term limits.
Here’s the real list of Chavez’s “greatest 
hits.” How about Chavez’s war on illiteracy, which educated millions of children and il-literate adults? The campaign against mal-nutrition among children? Or the initiative to establish thousands of worker coopera-
tives in every sector of the economy, guar-
anteeing workers control over their working 
lives? 
Frankly, I think America would be lucky 
to have a president like Chavez. We’ve had 
enough smooth businessmen sell America 
down the river.

It’s funny how you’re never really 
“done” with people in college. 
Remember that loud mouth 
from your English discussion sec-tion freshman year? Now, he’s dat-
ing your ex. And serving you a pita. 
This small-world phenomenon 
has given me a reason to vote in 
student government elections next week. Benjamin Dictor, the Progress Party’s presidential candidate, once called me a “scum bag.” And now, he’s going to pay. 
Two years ago, I posted a blog 
on Facebook concerning controver-sies plaguing a student organization I was in. At the time, my account’s privacy settings were wide-open, leading to a frenzy of comments on the post. 
Dictor, an unknown to me and 
to the organization, came across the post and jumped in on the action. In addition to “scum bag,” he said I was “worthless,” I totally lacked “value and decency” and my legacy will be “pathetic and minuscule.” 
I got over it. Not only have I heard 
much worse, the guy was right on 
the money. In fact, I was excited to hear that I’ll 
have any legacy whatsoever. 
Instead, I sim-
ply wondered: 
“Who the hell is 
Ben Dictor?” 
Two years later, he’s running for 
SG President. And now, as an apo-
litical student who doesn’t care if student government sends private e-mails to Santa Claus about hand scanners at homeless shelters, I’m stoked to have a legitimate reason to 
vote: revenge!What if you found out that guy 
who gave you the finger after cut-
ting you off on I-75 is now running for president? Hallelujah! You’d be a purple-thumbed Iraqi, exercis-
ing your democratic duty with the 
vengefulness of Jack Bauer. 
A vote is a dish best served cold. That’s what‘s great about democ-
racy. You can vote on whatever ar-bitrary grounds you want: tie color, FCAT score, rate of blinks per min-ute. 
To give him credit, Dictor is one 
of the smartest, most passionate and most capable candidates this uni-versity has ever seen. I just don’t like him because he called me a “scum bag.” It’s a silly, absurd and imma-ture reason to vote in what is rou-
tinely a silly, absurd and immature 
election. 
So when you cast your vote on 
Feb. 24 and 25, do so in shallow wa-ters. And candidates: if you want to reduce voter apathy, insults go a long way.
It worked for a scum bag like 
me.

bathroom renovations, Blansett wrote in an e-mail. 
The department has been working with the Inter-Resi-
dence Hall Association, for two years to place wireless In-
ternet in common areas through this reserve fund, Blansett wrote. 
Jon Sheffield, IRHA president, said students have ex-
pressed their desires for wireless in various residence hall meetings, and that IRHA staff members know from being students themselves how helpful the installation would be. Originally, the first phase of the project, which will install 
wireless in Hume Hall, the Beaty Towers, Jennings Hall, the Broward Area and the Yulee Area, was scheduled to begin 
in July, Blansett wrote. However, because contractors want 
projects to keep their employees working, the 
department was able to get a better deal on the installation, she wrote. 
The $400,000 will cover the cost of installa-
tion, hardware and wiring, Mian said.  
Because the money is coming from the reserve fund, the 
installation will not cause rent to go up, he said. 
Phase two, which will include the Tolbert Area, the Gra-ham Area and the Keys Residential Complex, is set for next year. Phase three, which will include the Springs and Lake-side residential complexes and Murphree area, will be fin-
ished either next year or 2011.
Mian said the dorms were scheduled for installation in 
the most cost-effective order. 
Sheffield said wireless Internet will be a good way to 
get students out of their dorms and into the common areas 
where they can meet other students. 
“We want students to be in the community,” he said. 
“That’s one of the most fantastic things that UF housing tries to provide.” IRHA president said students asked for wireless at dorm meetings
only getting items she knows will 
sell, and she works the sales desk when she wouldn’t have previ-
ously.  
But the relative protection af-
forded by local institutions comes 
with a downside, said Steve Or-lando, a UF spokesman.
“It’s kind of like putting all 
your eggs in one basket,” he said.
Government-funded institu-
tions provide economic stability until state budget cuts put that 
stability in jeopardy, he said. 
Officials at UF believe these 
relatively mild effects on the local 
economy could get worse if bud-get cuts continue.
“Our local economy may be in-
sulated,” said Ed Poppell, UF vice president for finance and adminis-tration, “but we are not immune.”
The Florida legislature will 
meet in two weeks and begin its 
annual 60-day session. 
Based on fiscal projections, the 
legislature will pass a new state budget during the session
"That may be when it really 
comes home to roost,” he said.
While Poppell expects budget 
cuts, he is optimistic about what the recent $782 billion stimulus 
package could mean for UF.
“It’s a lot of money overall, but 
when you start plugging every little hole, it’s used up quickly,” 
he said.
Because of the effect that bud-
get cuts could have on UF and 
Shands, the Chamber has also 
focused on expanding high-tech 
industries in Gainesville, DuRant said.    
This effort is led by Gainesville 
Technology Enterprise Center, 
commonly known as GTEC, which 
has assisted companies such as Es-cape Media Group, which runs the music sharing Web site Groove-
shark.
High-tech industry is generally 
cleaner than other industries, said 
Larry Kenny, a UF economics pro-
fessor.One of its drawbacks, how-
ever, is that many other cities are 
competing for the same type of 
business, particularly Orlando, he said.
UF is also making an effort to 
aid local businesses.
On March 2, the Heart of Flor-ida Regional Summit will be held 
at UF. The program is meant to aid local business in surviving the 
tough economy, Orlando said.To combat effects of budget cuts, Chamber is focusing on high-tech industry

Though many student senators were 
running around campaigning Wednesday 
on campus, not one was running in the UF Naval-ROTC event to promote the Safe Run program. 
Safe Run is a collaboration of Student 
Government and UF NROTC to provide students with a safe way of running on cam-pus at night by pairing them with NROTC volunteers. 
During today’s event, NROTC volun-
teers were supposed to run with partners, specifically senators, at 2:30 p.m. on cam-pus to raise awareness about the program, which has had low interest this semester, 
according to Michael Del Favero, the pro-
gram’s president. 
“Anyone could have signed up, but the 
focus was supposed to be senators,” said Sen. Samantha Sexton, the Student Senate Safe Run liaison who helped spearhead the program during the summer as a member of the Student Safety Committee. 
Sexton made an announcement at Tues-
day’s Senate meeting about the event, and Student Senate President Jordan Johnson encouraged senators to attend.
However, only the NROTC volunteers 
made it panting and sweating to the finish line on the North Lawn of the Reitz Union where a Safe Run table was set up with chips and Gatorade for runners. 
Sexton attributed the lack of senator par-
ticipation to Student Government campaign-ing, which was rampant on campus today. 
UF freshman Chris Baughman and ad-
vertising senior Kyle Cotton were the first to jog to the NROTC table after completing a 2-mile run around campus. 
Cotton, who has been a volunteer runner 
since the program began, said the average 
person he is paired with will run two miles. 
Del Favero said the program pairs run-
ners with volunteers who have the same 
running abilities. 
“I’m one of the fast people,” he said. “If 
there’s a seven-mile person, they’ll call me.”
As more volunteers reached the finish line, the group of about 15 NROTC members 
handed out fliers. They spoke with students 
walking by about the program, which is available Monday through Thursday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Students simply have to call an hour before they want to run and meet a volunteer at one of eight locations on cam-pus. 
Kamia Morris, UF family, youth and 
community sciences junior, was surprised to 
learn that the program is free, and said she’d 
definitely try it out. 
“Maybe this will motivate me not to use, 
‘it’s dark’ as an excuse,”Morris said. 
To contact the NROTC Safe Run program 
and set up a run with a volunteer, call 352-392-0973.

■ JOHN WALDO, 42,  WENT 
MISSING ON FEB. 11.
Authorities are looking for a 
Gainesville man who has been missing for a week.
The family of engineer John Waldo, 42, contacted the Gainesville Police Department this week after not having contact with 
him in days, said GPD spokesman 
Keith Kameg. 
There has been no sign of ac-
tivity from Waldo since Feb. 11 when detectives discovered his 
credit card was used 
at Calico Jacks Oyster 
Bar, 3502 SW Second 
Ave., Kameg said.
According to his family, he is 
a responsible man, and it is out of character for him to have missed 
work and family functions, Kameg said.
Officers continue to search for 
Waldo’s 2001 silver BMW 330i with a temporary Florida license plate number of ACM9754.Kameg said he hopes the com-
munity can help find Waldo.
Police urge anyone with infor-
mation on Waldo’s whereabouts to 
call detective Bennie Smith at 352-
334-2488.

Now that you practically never use your phone to actually talk, and “I’ll 
shoot you a text,” has become your personal motto, it’s okay to embrace 
the written word — and your text-messaging plan. But even if you don’t 
have unlimited texts, avoid these messaging mishaps, especially if you 
expect a response.
1. kay
Don’t lead the recipient of your text message on. Stay away from any form of  
“OK.” Your friends who still pay 10 cents a pop will thank you later. 
2. omg sry 
Abbreviations are like your textbooks, use them sparingly. Your thumbs will 
appreciate the exercise.
3. wut shuld I du
Spelling still applies when you’re texting, even if your phone doesn’t offer T9. 
Intentional typos are not cute; “wut” is always “what.”

says “hello” anymore. So get to the point.

Music has always been a litmus 
test for the times. 
In the ‘60s, Bob Dylan led the anti-
war movement singing folk songs to 
protest the Vietnam War. 
The ‘70s saw The Sex Pistols and 
The Clash decrying British aristocra -
cy and conservatism. 
Post-Berlin Wall, Nirvana and 
Pearl Jam ushered in the grunge 
movement with angsty, “shoegaze” 
melodies shunning ‘80s glam excess. 
In the early 2000s, while transition -
ing from Clinton to Bush, music ex -
perienced a garage-rock revival with 
fluid, distortion-heavy tunes from 
The Strokes and The White Stripes. 
As a historical pattern, the music 
reflected the politics. Music was ap -
propriately edgy, exciting and loud.
In 2009, we have Fleet Foxes.
With its full length debut album, 
“Fleet Foxes,” hailed as the Best Al -
bum of 2008 by Pitchfork Media, our 
generation seems to pale in compari -
son. 
A Renaissance-folk sounding 
band, with troubadour-like melodies 
so lulling and gentle they require a 
candlelit-vigil reverence, Fleet Foxes 
has taken over the indie scene as the 
preeminent buzz band. 
Leading a ticker-tape parade of 
similarly quiet, innocuous, ambient 
bands like Beirut, Grizzly Bear, and 
Bon Iver, Pitchfork’s choice seems 
quite anticlimactic given the current 
heady political and economic times. 
Why is the music not matching the 
mayhem? Is quiet the new loud?
We are at a time and space with 
no distinct musical backbone. We are 
in danger of cultivating a wallflower 
generation. 
A demand for the quality and vol -
ume of music doubles as a demand 
for the quality and volume of society. 
With a new presidency and a burgeon -
ing economic crisis, our music should 
not be whispering and wailing.
Now that the fervent Obama sup -
porters are out of a gig, does this 
mean our generation should sit back 
and warp music into a medium of 
content? Of complacency? 
Music should act as a medium for 
discontent. Why not incite revolution 
Stamp-Act style or set cars on fire, 
like the French?
While Fleet Foxes’ music is admit -
tedly soothing, I want our genera -
tion’s music to return to ear-crushing 
volumes because I want our genera -
tion to be remembered as more than 
just being in a lull.
At your next concert or music store 
purchase, ask yourself this question:
Are you listening?With a new presidency and 
a burgeoning economic 
crisis, our music should not be
 whispering and wailing.  ““12, ALLIGATOR  � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2009
Ryan “RyMo” Moran, drummer of the 
reggae-rock band Slightly Stoopid, said his 
band was voted one of the top ten least like -
ly to succeed in high school.
“When we first started, the guys were 
just punk kids,” he said. “Sixteen years old 
in high school and, you know, pissed.”
Moran vaguely remembers how Slightly 
Stoopid came up with its name. The mem -
bers were hanging out in a room full of 
people smoking marijuana, when someone 
made a meaningless comment. 
Someone else responded by saying, 
“What? That’s uh… slightly stupid.” 
Inspiration struck.
Slightly Stoopid, hailing from Ocean 
Beach, Calif., will play at The Venue with 
Inner Circle and the Supervillains tonight at 
8 p.m. Tickets cost $20.
Moran said the band’s style has evolved 
since high school. The “teen angst” has, for 
the most part, evaporated.
“We were fans of all styles of music,” he 
said. “Hip hop, jazz, reggae, classical, rock 
and roll and everything in between – all 
those styles, I think, come through in our 
current sound.”
The band writes songs about pot, parties, 
hanging out, getting in trouble, being at 
the beach, skateboarding, making love and 
making war.
“We’re beach kids,” he said. “It’s just 
part of being around the ocean. You smoke 
a joint to enhance the experience.”
In high school, Slightly Stoopid was 
signed by Brad Nowell of the legendary 
reggae-punk band Sublime to his new label, 
Skunk Records. The band had the privilege of playing 
shows with Sublime in 1996, shortly before 
Nowell’s death.
For 12 years, Slightly Stoopid has toured 
the country. It wasn’t an easy job, Moran 
said. 
He and the other members did whatever 
it took to make ends meet, from digging 
ditches to serving coffee.
“You make a little money on tour, and 
you’re cool for a bit. Then you start getting 
low on cash. You gotta 
find a gig, work for a 
couple months or a 
few weeks even, and 
then you can get back 
on the road again,” he 
said. 
“We stuck with it 
because we believed 
in what we did.”
Until about 6 
months ago, Slightly Stoopid’s songs were 
not played on the radio.
“We’ve been touring underground for 12 
years, selling out huge amphitheaters, and 
just this past year, the radio has caught on a 
little bit,” Moran said. 
“Getting on the radio and having hits 
was never our focal point.”
Tonight at The Venue, fans can expect to 
hear songs from every album, ranging from 
crazy punk to mellow reggae.
“We approach every show like it’s anoth -
er night,” Moran said. “We’re gonna come 
out, play some old stuff, some new stuff, 
some in-between stuff and have a good 
time.”Slightly Stoopid gains fameFilm mixes pompoms, humor

MORANHENRY TAKSIER  � AVENUE WRITERKARINA GALVEZ  � AVENUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER
The times when the football 
star sweeps the head cheerleader 
off her feet as easily as he makes a 
touchdown are over. 
“Fired Up!” takes the stars of the 
Gerald R. Ford High School foot -
ball team out of their jerseys and 
into uniforms as they weasel their 
way out of football camp and into 
cheer camp. With 
their not-so-hidden 
agenda of hooking 
up with as many girls 
as possible in the 
summer, Nick Brady 
and Shawn Colfax 
convince cheerlead -
ing captain Carly that being on the 
team could improve the squad’s 
performance at camp.
Having exhausted their options 
of available girls at their school, the 
boys dare not put the moves on the 
cheerleaders who are well aware 
of their Casanova ways. The boys take advantage of the favorable ra -
tio of girls to boys at camp. They 
must learn to balance their girl-cra -
zy appetites and their commitment 
to the squad. The plan to conquest 
as many unsuspecting girls as pos -
sible in a span of three weeks goes 
awry when they begin to develop 
feelings for two unexpected girls. 
 “Fired Up!” fits 
right into the teen-
movie genre: sports 
star protagonists, un -
suspecting girls that 
fall in their love traps, 
the mysterious older 
woman, the villain -
ous other team, the scum-bag boy -
friends and sexual ambiguity. The 
“American Pie” meets “Bring it 
On” film packs pompoms, slapstick 
humor and strange love with a hint 
of charm that makes the characters 
likable and leaves the audience 
cheering along.
The Avenue spoke with McCord about her role as Gwyneth 
in the new film “Fired Up!” during a college press conference 
call. McCord is known for her roles on Nip/Tuck and 90210. 
The film opens in theaters Friday .
Q: What did you enjoy most about playing Gwyneth, 
the villain?
A:  “The best part is that you get to be a mean person. 
You get to take out all your aggression. There is a mim -
ing scene where I’m wiping the drool off our opponent’s 
mouth. It was so obnoxious. If anyone did that in real life it would be so 
messed up, but it’s hysterical for the film.”The “American Pie” 
meets “Bring it On” 
film packs pom -
poms, slapstick humor 
and strange love 
with a hint of charm““

sex on the avenueEmbrace your neighbor’s squeaky sex with laughter 
Oh yeah, baby. Harder! Yes, yes, yes!
Come on, I know you’re familiar with 
this. Either you’re guilty of screaming it or 
you’ve heard it. As college students, our 
living quarters tend to cause occasional is -
sues with loud sex. 
There are the squeaks, the thrusts, 
the moans and always the screams; but 
with endless amounts of hormones flying 
around Gainesville and far too much alco -
hol available, it’s a lot harder to keep your 
pants on than you think. 
And I’ve realized, from both personal 
and hearsay experiences, that people hav -
ing sex just don’t care how loud they are 
and who hears them. It’s as if the bedroom 
is a sanctuary where what you say—or 
scream—cannot and will not be used 
against you. 
It’s rarely even brought up to someone 
how loud they are in bed. Hinting at it is 
forbidden territory and causes far too awk -
ward of a situation to get stuck in.
So, with no way around loud sex, how 
do you deal with it? Simply putting up with 
the eeh-uh-eeh-uh of your roommate’s old 
bedsprings leaves you annoyed and sleep -
less.  
The only solution? Embrace it. Loud sex can serve many different pur -
poses, both good and bad. First and fore -
most, it’s no secret that noisy sex is pretty 
much always annoying. You’re just sitting 
in your room trying to watch lectures when 
all of a sudden the pencil holder and pic -
ture frames on your desk start to shake be -
cause the bed next door is hitting the wall a 
wee bit too hard. 
And it’s even worse 
when you’re trying to 
sleep—either in the 
morning or at night—
and the thrusting from 
the apartment above you 
keeps you wide awake 
regardless of the midterm you have the 
next morning. 
But almost worse than being annoying, 
cacophony in the bedroom can be over -
whelmingly awkward. 
Imagine this, you’re in bed with a friend-
with-benefits, but the two of you have yet to 
do the dirty deed. This friend’s roommates, 
however, are way ahead of you and you’ve 
got rooms to the left, right and above you 
going at it while you and your friend lay 
together silently questioning whether or 
not you should be doing it too.There’s no way to pretend it’s not hap -
pening, and it just puts you in an uncom -
fortable situation. 
And what if you’re in the dorms with no 
preference of furniture, which leaves you 
stuck with—yup, you guessed it—bunk 
beds. I don’t think horrifyingly awkward 
even begins to describe what to do when 
your bunkmate mounts her man in the top 
bunk shaking the entire thing as if you put 
a quarter in a vibrating mo -
tel cot.  
But, like I said, embrac -
ing these situations is the 
only way out. And if you 
try to look at it differently, 
it can actually become quite 
an amusing issue. 
You first have to think about how fun 
loud sex is. Nobody wants to hold anything 
back in the bedroom. So do your best not 
to blame anybody who might be making a 
little more noise than you’d prefer. 
And by embracing the moans and 
screams of your roommate or neighbor, I 
don’t mean joining in on them or mimick -
ing (we don’t want to spoil someone else’s 
fun), make light of them either by yourself 
or with your friends. 
If you’re in the living room watching TV and your roommate’s going at it in the next 
room, call a friend and tell them what’s up. 
I bet you’ll be laughing within seconds.  
And if you’re stuck in bed with a hook-
up and you guys aren’t doing it, but the 
couple in the next room is, laugh about it. 
Giggling releases any unwanted tension 
and the awkwardness will quickly vanish. 
But if you’re actually overly annoyed with 
the loud sex of someone in your vicinity, 
your headphones are your best bet. And 
if it’s a persistent annoyance, you might 
want to invest in a loud fan to drown out 
the noise. 
That being said, those of you who are 
causing all these noise violations need to be 
aware of a few things too. Nobody is going 
to blame you for being loud in bed, but just 
keep in mind that everyone can hear you. 
And do your best to keep the noise level 
down if your roommate is recently single, 
there is no need to rub it in someone’s face 
that you’re getting some and they’re not. 
They already know this and don’t need to 
hear it. 
So do your best to find the humor in 
awkward, loud sex situations and try not to 
be unnecessarily loud. After all, there’s no 
reason to be afraid of things that go bump 
in the night. ASHELY ROSS  � AVENUE WRITER

ON TELEVISIONIt doesn’t matter. 
Let Alex Rodriguez inject himself with steroids. Let 
Barry Bonds keep his records. Let Mark McGwire plead 
the fifth.
Instead, let’s worry about what really matters, something 
that goes above the score of a game. Think of a 10-year-old 
boy with his Rodriguez jersey sitting in his living room and 
watching his idol admit to making a horrible mistake.
That’s why UF athletes are so im-
portant to the Gainesville community 
— especially the baseball team. They don’t have a choice anymore. While 
hung heads on the TV express shame, 
these guys can show hope and prom-ise to the youth of Gainesville.
“It’s something that any athlete at 
the University of Florida, when they come in, they have to realize that this is a college town,” Gators senior in-
fielder Brandon McArthur said. “This isn’t a big city. The football players, the basketball players, the golfers, the swim-
mers, the gymnastics team, everyone looks up to (us).”
He’s right.
It can’t be denied: Children have these questions. Do you 
need steroids to be the next great baseball hero? If Rodriguez 
did it, why shouldn’t I? Isn’t taking this shortcut easier?
If they want to know why they shouldn’t do it, ask play-
ers like McArthur. Behind the inflated stats are the increased 
risks of heart disease and, well, not having some male body parts be as big as they once were. You really don’t want to 
explain that one to your wife, fellas.
The 32 baseball players who will wear orange and blue 
this season won’t ever receive half the acclaim one of the 
aforementioned professional players have. However, when a 
group of high school — or even younger — ball players come 
POLL QUESTION ONLINEAndrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF center Alex Tyus is fouled by Alabama forward Justin Knox in the 
Gators’ 83-74 win against Alabama on Wednesday night.
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer

The Gators are tired of chasing 
the past.
The memories of last year have 
critics predicting another late-
season collapse, and the shadows 
cast by two national champion-
ships have left a group of players — most of whom were still in high school at the time — stumbling in the dark.
They took their first step toward 
brighter skies Wednesday.
After a slide that saw UF (20-6, 
7-4 Southeastern Conference) lose 
three of its last four games and 
drop all the way to fourth in the SEC East, the Gators are back in the win column thanks to an 83-74 victory against Alabama (13-12, 3-8 SEC) in the O’Connell Center.
“I really get and understand the 
expectations here,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “My first two years 
here were losing seasons. I have a 
level of appreciation for starting over.”
The victory marks the 11th 
straight season UF has posted 20 or more wins and kept the Gators perfect at home this year.
Guard Nick Calathes led the 
way with 22 points and center 
Alex Tyus played well down low, 
scoring 16 and grabbing seven re-bounds.
Alabama cut the UF lead — 
which was as high as 15 earlier in the game — to 55-50 halfway 
through the second half. 
It was the kind of game the 
Gators have found ways to lose 
earlier in the season.This time, they pulled out a win, 
making their final six foul shots.
“I understand all their flaws, 
and all their flaws can be seen,” Donovan said. “Sometimes we get a little bit fatigued or get tired, or they’re young or they’re thinner or they’re not quite as big. Yeah, they get pushed around a little bit, but they’re giving me everything they 
have.”

UF WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
By CHRISTOPHER YAZBEC
Alligator Writer
cyazbec@alligator.org
Home will be a welcome sight for Sha 
Brooks and Marshae Dotson.
They better enjoy it while they can.
The duo, along with fellow seniors 
Aneika Henry and Kim Critton, will be 
playing its final two home games this weekend, beginning tonight at 7 against 
Arkansas (15-11, 4-7 Southeastern Confer-
ence).
They will wrap up their home careers on Sunday at 1 p.m. when No. 15 UF (22-4, 8-3 SEC) hosts South Carolina (10-14, 2-9 SEC).
“Probably very emotional,” Brooks said 
of what being recognized will be like. “I’m going to try not to cry.”
Dotson didn’t quite feel the same way.“(It’s) just another game, a recognition 
of players that are about to leave,” Dotson said.
Whatever the moment will mean to 
them individually, the seniors will all look to cap off their final years with an unblem-
ished home record of 15-0.If they do so, they will become just the 
third team in UF history to accomplish 
that feat.
Aside from the 1997-
98 Gators squad, only UF coach Amanda Butler’s 1993-94 team went un-defeated at home. It was 
also Butler’s senior year 
as a player.
“It’s a huge feather in 
your cap,” Butler said. “I 
got to experience that as a player. I can’t remember what happened at all in my playing career, but I can tell you us going 
undefeated at home was a huge deal, was a huge sense of pride for that team that I was fortunate to be a part of.
“I know that they will feel the same 
way. As seniors on this ball club, it’s part of their legacy in establishing this as one of the toughest places in the country to 
play.”
For Brooks and Dotson, it would be 
something else to add to their incredible 
resumes.
In their four years at UF, they have Brooks, Dotson to wrap up home careers this week

Conventional wisdom says, “If 
it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
Don’t tell that to UF coach Tim 
Walton.
Prior to the No. 2 UF softball 
team’s games in the Lipton Invita-
tional last weekend, Walton made 
a surprising change to his lineup. 
Kim Waleszonia, who has led off for the last four years, switched spots with sophomore Aja Paculba, who normally followed Waleszo-
nia in the order.
Waleszonia and Paculba batted 
one-two for most of last season, 
when they were named Third- and 
Second-Team All-Americans, re-
spectively.
So why change an order that 
was already working?
“Coach brought (the idea) to 
me,” Paculba said. “After Jackson-ville, he was just like, ‘You’re hit-ting really well. I just want to try it out for this week and see how it 
goes.’ I don’t know if he’s going to 
keep it, but it seems to be work-ing.”
The two made the change 
smoothly, as Waleszonia had two 
triples in UF’s 8-0 win against 
Coastal Carolina on Friday, and Paculba continued her impressive play at the plate with seven hits 
and 11 runs over the weekend.  
The Gators will need the switch at the top of the lineup to remain 
effective as they travel to Palm Springs, Calif., for the Cathedral City Classic, which starts today. 
The three-day tournament will 
pit the Gators against the highest-ranked competition they have faced all season. Today, UF will 
take on No. 14 Fresno State at 6:30 
p.m. and No. 3 Arizona State, the defending national champion, at 11:30 p.m.
Walton said he is looking for-
ward to the opportunity to play against some of the best teams in the country and see how his team responds to tougher competition.
“We need to learn how we’re 
going to play in tight games,” Wal-ton said Sunday. “We need tight games to really determine exactly what kind of championship team 
we’re gonna be, and we’ll get plen-
ty of tight games.”
Pitchers Stacey Nelson (4-1) 
and Stephanie Brombacher (4-0) 
have only allowed one earned 
run combined all season, so if the Gators come out on the losing end of close games, the hitting is likely responsible.
For Waleszonia, that will be 
easier thanks to her new spot in the order. While Paculba feels out the pitcher in the leadoff spot, 
Waleszonia gets to read the pitches 
and have a better idea of what to expect at the plate.
As for whether or not their 
coach is convinced of his players’ ability to thrive in their new posi-tions, Walton left little room for 
any doubt.
“I love it. Love it, love it, love it. 
We’re dangerous that way — more 
dangerous than we were before,” Walton said after the Gators put 26 total runs on the board in their two games Saturday.
Walton added that he would 
discuss the level of comfort Pac-ulba and Waleszonia felt with their new spots in the lineup, but after UF knocked in 11 runs in its win against Georgia Tech on Sun-day, Walton seemed appropriately 
pleased with his lineup change.
“I’m not even going to have 
a meeting. They don’t even get a 
vote anymore. It’s gonna happen,” he said.THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 19

UF SOFTBALLBatting-order change breathes new life into offense
The Gators have tended to fatigue and fade down the 
stretch this year, a vice Donovan said can be explained by 
lack of depth.
The surprising transfer of point guard Jai Lucas before 
the season and injuries to Adam Allen, and more recently 
Allan Chaney, have left Donovan with a short bench.
“No one wants to talk about the fact that two starters are 
gone from last year,” Donovan said.
Donovan said it’s unfair to expect this team to live up to 
the expectations of the ones that came before it.Right now, the coach points out, his players are simply 
trying to find their own path.
“They’re not Noah, Horford, Brewer and Green and 
Humphrey. They’re not those guys,” Donovan said. “It’s not 
even about them upholding a standard of what those guys did. It’s about them trying to create their own legacy. That time’s over with. That happened two years ago.”One thing is certain: If the Gators hope to make it back 
to the NCAA Tournament, they need to find their identity soon.
“Now is really the time to focus and get wins,” guard 
Erving Walker said. “We can’t be losing anymore.”
ANY GIVEN WEDNESDAY: Prior to the game, Donovan showed the team a motivational video that combined Al Pacino’s locker room speech from the movie “Any Given Sunday” with highlights from the season.
Donovan said the video was an attempt to build team 
unity.
The ploy seemed to work.
“Al Pacino, that guy’s tough,” Calathes said.Donovan uses speech from ‘Any Given Sunday’ to build team unity
thrown numbers to the side.
Brooks and Dotson have 
played in all 120 games of their 
careers.
Brooks has started 119 games, 
including a school record 117 in a row. Dotson has scored in all but 
one game in her career and has grabbed at least one rebound in every game she has played.
Brooks is averaging more than 
19 points in SEC games and leads her team in nearly every offen-sive category, while Dotson is 
posting more than 14 points in league games and has the No. 1 
field goal per-
centage in the conference.
D o t s o n 
grabbed her 800th career re-bound against 
Tennessee, and she and Brooks have eclipsed the 1,000-point mark.
Brooks is one of only two UF 
players to score 1,500 points, re-
cord 275 assists and collect 200 
steals in her career.
The list goes on, but probably 
the most important stat for these 
two seniors over their four years is coming from a 9-22 team two 
years ago to 22-4 now.
“For their careers to culminate 
in a season like this that still has 
the potential to be the best season 
ever in the history of the program, I think it speaks a lot about them and their toughness and their re-
siliency,” Butler said.Gators seniors reveling in team’s sharp turnaround since Butler’s arrival
to Gainesville for a camp, the Gators have an 
opportunity. They have a chance to be a dif-ferent kind of role model and, perhaps, set a 
more positive course. 
“We get a lot of kids out here, and you 
want to give them the right image of how 
to play the game,” junior center fielder Matt 
den Dekker said. “Doing the right things off the field. … If (talks about illegal substanc-
es) would arise, I would definitely tell them that’s not the way to play. It puts a negative image on the game. When you see things like 
that happening, you don’t want to give kids 
the wrong image of how to play the game.” 
Baseball is not a dirty sport, nor is it a 
game that requires enhancing substances to be successful.
And, obviously, UF baseball players don’t 
like to talk outright about steroids. I don’t blame them. Truthfully, I wish we could leave all this talk behind us. Completely for-get about it. Wash it from our minds. The players can do that. The kids and young 
players, however, can not. They’re the ones 
with the questions.
“A lot of people look up to us, and guys 
shouldn’t get on cloud nine about that,” McArthur said. “They should just realize 
how to handle themselves.”
What these athletes have to realize now is when it is time to “handle” something. That 
would be taking action. It’s not something they can hide from. 
There will be questions, maybe even 
doubts, from the outside. That’s when it’s their turn to show how to be different.
The corrupt are already damaged goods. 
Let’s not put the next generation in their same shoes.
Hopefully, UF’s athletes realize that — 
for everyone’s sake.BRIAN , from page 18SENIORS , from page 18ALABAMA , from page 18

Josh Adams had little idea what 
position he would play for most of 
last season, as he split time between six spots.
This year, he could be almost as 
confused.
The sophomore will start the 
season in the infield, most likely at third base, but he could also see time at shortstop and second. 
Senior Brandon McArthur is the 
only other lock to start in the in-field, but he plays multiple positions as well, lining up at first and third 
base.
With the loss of shortstop Cole 
Figueroa to the MLB Draft, Adams 
will be looked at to join McArthur as a leader of the infield. No mat-ter where he plays on opening day, teammates can expect to hear from him.
“If I’m at short, second, third, 
wherever, I’m still going to have the same vocal voice as I would if I was in the outfield,” Adams said.
The only other returning infield-
er with experience is junior Clayton Pisani, but his career has been incon-sistent. He has started 70 games in his two years but has a .263 career batting average, dropping to .242 in 
Southeastern Conference play.
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan expects 
Pisani to turn his experience into 
consistent reults. 
“I’m looking forward to him 
stepping up his game and being 
more consistent,” O’Sullivan said. 
“He has been in the system for four years now, he’s played in SEC play, he’s had some success in the past, and I’m hoping he can jump his game up.”
If Pisani proves to be unreliable, 
freshman Jerico Weitzel has been 
working to prove he can be the ev-
eryday second baseman.
Weitzel isn’t the only freshman 
the Gators are expecting to contrib-ute in the infield this year. First base-man Preston Tucker has been wow-ing teammates and coaches with his power from the left side of the plate.
“I don’t understand how you can 
hit the ball that far,” Adams said of Tucker’s hitting ability.
Tucker’s raw power reminded 
McArthur of when he first saw for-
mer Gator Matt LaPorta hit.
While his hitting 
has been impres-sive, he has been 
working on bring-
ing his defense 
up to par. Even if his defense isn’t ready, Tucker will still find a spot in the lineup as the designated hitter.
Defense has been one of the main 
things O’Sullivan said the Gators need to improve from last year.
Palm Beach Community Col-
lege transfer Mike Mooney brings a glove that comes with plenty of awards. He was named Southern 
Conference Defensive Player of the 
Year both years at PBCC and NJ-CAA Division I Easton Defensive Player of the Year in 2007. He also earned the Region 8/Gulf District Defensive Player of the Year honor and was named to the Rawlings Gold Glove team.O’Sullivan has named Mooney 
the opening day starter at shortstop and said it is his job to lose.
During fall practices, Mooney 
surprised coaches with his produc-tion at the plate.
“Coming in, I think from all the 
awards I’ve won and all the stories about me, they expected near perfec-tion in the infield, and whatever they get at the plate, they get,” Mooney said. “I came in and showed them I can hit a little bit, and from the de-fensive standpoint, I hope I’ve lived up to expectations.”20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2009
