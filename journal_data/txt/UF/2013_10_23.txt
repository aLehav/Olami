An article by Thrillist.com recently honored popular drunk 
eateries at the top party schools in the nation, and Gainesville’s 
Relish made the cut.
Relish was chosen as the best intoxicated eatery at UF, but 
runners-up included Five Star Pizza and Larry’s Giant Subs.
Other listed favorites include the Grill at the University of 
Georgia, New York Roma Pizza at the University of Miami and Guthrie’s at Florida State University.Zack Henrikson, shift leader at the downtown Relish loca-
tion and a 20-year-old Santa Fe College English sophomore, said he agreed with the decision.
“I think that the Midtown location is really good for drunk people because it’s so close to all the bars, and it’s right across the street from campus,” he said.
Henrikson said that on popular going-out nights like Thurs-
day, Friday and Saturday, the restaurant has to “funnel people in.”
“In the downtown location, we’re the only place that’s still 
open, so everybody just comes and gets a burger,” he said.
However, even with the multitude of choices for late-night 
eats, Henrikson said he thinks burgers will always come out Drunk residents’ relished burgers top national list
� MORE THAN 57,000 ADULTS IN 
THEIR 20s REPORTED BEING IDENTITY THEFT VICTIMS IN 2012.

Jordan McPherson thinks twice before he 
uses his credit card.
The 18-year-old UF journalism freshman 
said after his grandmother’s identity was sto-len, he became much more cautious about how 
he handles important personal information.
And he has good reason.
The Better Business Bureau recently report-
ed that college students make up the highest 
percentage of identity theft victims.
The Consumer Sentinel Network Data 
Book found 57,491 adults between the ages of 20 and 29 reported being identity theft victims in 2012.
The bureau stated that those numbers 
accounted for about 21 percent of the total number of reported thefts, the highest of any 10-year age range. The data book also found Florida has the highest rate of reported iden-tity thefts.
Alicia Keaton, a senior associate director 
at UF Student Financial Affairs, said she has heard of some UF students having their iden-tity stolen, but she wouldn’t consider it a ram-pant problem.
Because college students tend to be more 
lax with their information, she said, it makes them more susceptible to identity theft.
Keaton said stealing mail and changing ad-
dress forms are common types of identity theft, as well as phishing — emailing consumers asking for username or password information. Thieves often identify themselves as a bank, a College students most susceptible to identity theft, report saysKAYLA MARCUS

Favorable fall weather and un-
usual amounts of summer rain may 
have balanced out for local pumpkin 
patches.
Rogers Farm, 3831 NW 156th Ave., 
has produced locally in years past, 
but this year, it had to ship in pump-
kins from Mississippi due to excess 
rain during this year’s growing sea-son.
“We normally grow our own 
pumpkins,” said Earline Rogers, whose husband owns Rogers Farm. “The soil is too wet for the seeds to grow this year.”
But Rogers said the patch still seems to be thriving with customers.
The values of pumpkins harvested 
from the six top producing states to-talled $113 million, according to a 
U.S. Census press release. 
Megan Bultemeier, the youth di-
rector at the First United Methodist 
Church of Alachua, 14805 NW 140th St., said business is booming at the 
church’s pumpkin patch.
She said it seemed to be doing 
slightly better than last year.
“The weather has been nice this 
year, and I think that has helped,” 
Bultemeier said.
So far, the church’s patch has re-
ceived two shipments totaling about 3,500 pumpkins, ranging from 50 
cents to $35. She said pumpkins range 
in variety, too.
“Our pumpkins come in all shapes 
and sizes,” Bultemeier said. One was 
so large that “one youth could not ﬁ  t 
their arms around it themselves,” she said.Local pumpkin patches

The Fall batch of senators broke 
the habit of approving recommen-
dations and bills unanimously at 
Tuesday night’s Student Senate 
meeting.
The Allocations Committee chair 
nomination was singled out from 
the block of Replacement and Agen-
da Committee recommendations that were unanimously approved at the beginning of the meeting.
One senator took issue with the 
nomination of Sen. Davis Bean for the allocations chair position. Bean had no previous experience on the committee.
Senate President Pro Tempore 
and Replacement and Agenda Committee chair Elliot Grasso said committee members selected Bean for his experience on the Budget and Appropriations Committee and various fee committees.
“His ideas really made him stand 
out as a great candidate,” Grasso 
said.
During the allotted presentation 
time, Bean declined to speak on his 
own behalf.
Sen. Michael Christ said he be-
lieved allocations vice chair Liz Kleinfeld, who also applied for the position, was a better ﬁ  t.
“I felt when we’re looking for an 
allocations chair, we should look to the committee ﬁ  rst,” Christ said.
In a vote, two nays failed to ne-
gate the broad majority of yeas, and 
Bean was appointed allocations 
chair.
Sen. Liz Kleinfeld said she did 
not review Bean’s qualiﬁ  cations.
“I was obviously trying to go for 
it, but I don’t have a comment,” she said.New senators take a 
stand about nominee

good when you’re intoxicated,” she 
said.Burtscher said the topping options 
seal the deal for many patrons. Her fa-vorite is the fried egg.
The popularity of Relish was echoed 
by the Thrillist article, which called Rel-ish “one of Gainesville’s top pick-up spots… seriously” and “hands-down the most fun line in town,” especially 
when “your friends start passing out 
left and right because of the wait  — so be ready to abandon them to get your burger.”But not all UF students agree. Will 
Baldock, a 21-year-old microbiology senior, said he prefers other spots for his post-Midtown meals.
Baldock said he sees more patrons 
at Taco Bell and Steak ‘n Shake, his per-sonal favorite.
“It’s not as much food,” he said. 
“With the Relish burgers, it’s a lot of food, and I want substance but not a ton of food after I’ve gone out to Mid-town.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2013

“Gary killed her.”
Those were the words Joe Jackson’s 
17-year-old daughter Lisa said in a phone call from the hospital the morning of Aug. 29, 1989. Jackson’s first love and ex-wife had been 
stabbed and shot in the throat by her new hus-
band Gary.
“There was blood everywhere, all up and 
down the walls, like she was crawling to get out of there,” he said.
Jackson is a longtime board member of 
Peaceful Paths, a domestic violence network that works with Alachua, Bradford and Union counties to aid survivors.
He shared his story at a news conference 
Tuesday, when the network officially an-nounced the launch of the High Risk Team in Alachua County.
The team will take on local cases of domes-
tic violence and will meet monthly with local experts and community advocates to assess how dangerous the relationships are. The goal is to provide a stronger system for supporting victims of intimate partner violence.
“One of the very productive outcomes of 
this team effort has been the research,” said Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell. “Each year going back to 2003, there’s a minimum of 1,500 and as much as 1,900 related offenses in addition to the ultimate offense, which is mur-der.”
The group will work out a plan to get vic-
tims to talk, said Capt. Lynne Benck, com-mander of the GPD Investigations Bureau.
“Statistics show that a lot of people who are 
actually victims of intimate partner violence never actually contact the law enforcement,” she said. “That’s a problem area. But there’s no doubt in my mind we will identify a plan of action to save lives.”
The team’s greatest hope is to be a system 
of power against the threat of domestic vio-lence, said Theresa Beachy, Peaceful Path’s ex-
ecutive director.
“We’re the first in Florida to do this at the 
high-risk team level,” Darnell said.
Jackson said he’s proud of the continuing 
efforts made by the organization.
“This is one of the best groups of people 
you can find, here at Peaceful Paths. The im-
pact is tremendous,” Jackson said.Alachua County domestic violence task force launches

� SEXUALIZED AVATARS LEAVE WOMEN 
FEELING OBJECTIFIED. 
LAUREN ADHAV
Alligator Contributing Writer
The virtual world can have some serious implications 
in reality, according to recent study conclusions from 
Stanford University researchers.
Jeremy Bailenson and Jesse Fox, researchers at Stan-
ford’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, found women 
who become sexualized avatars in a virtual reality 
world feel objectified and are more likely to accept rape myths.
An “avatar” is the virtual representation of a user 
where the user can create an online character and control the actions of that character, much like “The Sims.”
“The bias towards women is ridiculous and crude,” 
said Sarah Hernandez, vice president of UF’s Women’s Student Association.
Although the video game industry is largely made up 
of men and marketed toward them, it should be more inclusive to women, the 19-year-old public relations sophomore said.
During the study, women wore helmets that blocked 
out their surroundings, immersing them in a virtual, 3-D world. Some women became sexualized avatars, wear-ing short dresses and cleavage-bearing tops, while other women became nonsexualized avatars.
After their time in the virtual world, participants filled 
out a questionnaire and researchers found from the re-sults that women who took on sexualized avatars agreed more with rape myths. One myth in the questionnaire is that in the majority of rapes the victim is promiscuous or has a bad reputation. The findings were published in the science journal Computers in Human Behavior.
Popular video games such as “God of War,” “Mortal 
Kombat” and “Tomb Raider” often depict sexualized fe-
male characters.
“Just because there’s more men in the field doesn’t 
mean that there has to be more objectification and mi-
sogyny,” Hernandez said.   
Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a vid-
eo game research firm, found that of 669 games that had protagonists with recognizable genders, 24 had female protagonists — only 3 percent.
Jordan Youngblood, 27, a UF doctoral candidate, said 
being embodied in a virtual world leaves behind “the residue of experience.”
His research includes gaming, gender and sexual-
ity, and he agreed there is an unequal representation of women in video games. He said female characters are encoded to act and respond in games in a way that per-petuates negative female stereotypes.
“I think it would be short-sighted to say that video 
games don’t have ideological impacts,” he said. “This is 
still a very problematic issue on an everyday basis.”Sexy characters 
may have startling consequences

credit card company or even as UF to get information. She 
said students should never respond to those emails.
“Nobody is ever going to ask you to confirm your user-
name or password,” she said.
Failure to receive bills, receiving credit cards that weren’t 
applied for, having credit denied or receiving calls from debt collectors are all signs that a person might have had his or her identity stolen.
Keaton said the Student Financial Management Center 
offers financial literacy courses about identity theft, and the department will go to classes or organizations to educate UF students about the process.
“There are so many ways for your identity to be stolen,” 
she said.iDENTiTY , from page 1“We’re the first in Florida to do

UF has been selected as the next 
university to help spread happi-
ness.
UF’s collegiate chapter of the 
Happiness Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization based out of Mary-
land with a mission to spread news about the dangers of drunk driving,  officially became a student organi-zation Oct. 4.
The foundation was created af-
ter a drunk driving accident on May 15, 2011, injured one passenger and left three young adults dead.
None of the passengers knew 
at the time that the decision they 
made to get in a car with a drunk 
driver would change the lives of many forever, said Victoria Wrig-
ley, president of Gators For Happi-
ness.
Wrigley, a 20-year-old UF mar-
keting junior, lost three friends that night. Since then, she and the com-munity have been trying to spread awareness of drunk driving.
“At the end of the day, Gators 
For Happiness would like to see UF 
students view drunk driving as so-
cially unacceptable,” Wrigley said. “We would like to see students take responsibility for their own safety.”
Car crashes are the leading cause of teenage deaths, and about 
a quarter of them involve an un-
derage drunk driver, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
The club plans to host benefit 
concerts, hand out promise shirts, raise awareness and provide trans-portation for students who have been drinking, Wrigley said.
Gators For Happiness also plans 
on working together with other stu-dent organizations on campus to make shirts that include the Happi-ness logo.
“Having a club on campus that is trying to help prevent students 
from driving after a night of drink-
ing is such a great approach and will be a big eye-opener for stu-dents,” said Erika Cook, a 20-year-old UF criminology junior.
Cook said she lost friends to 
drunk driving and doesn’t want anyone to go through the same pain.
“Drunk driving is preventable,” 
she said. “I’m glad an organization on campus is finally going to be able to show students how impact-ful one decision can actually be.”

Gainesville Police are look-
ing for information about a 
Tuesday morning crash involv-ing a semitruck and a woman who was found on the road 
with severe injuries.
At about 3 a.m., an officer 
heard a loud crash coming from 
a truck driving south on North-east Waldo Road, wrote GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias in an email. The truck, driven by 62-year-old Wayne Primm of Virginia, slowed down but 
didn’t stop. 
The officer then saw a 
woman, later identified as 34-
year-old Cherry A. Smith, ly-ing in the middle of the road at the intersection of Northeast Third Avenue, Tobias said. The Gainesville resident was taken to UF Health Shands Hospital with life-threatening injuries. 
After police issued an alert 
for the truck, another officer stopped it at the intersection 
of Southeast 16th Avenue and 
Southeast Williston Road, Tobi-as said. The officer reported that Primm seemed sleepy. The offi-cer also observed a wig stuck in the front grill of the truck. 
Police later found Primm 
had been driving for more than 12 hours. He began his trip at 
about 2 p.m. and made a stop in 
Jacksonville. Investigators also found that Smith was crossing Northeast Waldo Road when Primm hit her.
Residents are encouraged to 
call GPD’s Traffic Safety Team at 352-393-7744 with any infor-mation.Semitruck driver hit

Growing up was a challenge in itself for 
Robert Brown, but growing up as a black, 
gay male was a different story.
Robert Brown and Nate Gay visited the 
Institute of Black Culture on Tuesday night 
for a talk titled “Mr. and Mr. Being Black, 
Gay and in Love,” to talk about the experi-ence of growing up as being both black and gay in the South and the media attention their marriage received.
Brown and Gay grew up in Kentucky in 
Baptist families. They said it was hard for them to express themselves while trying to fit a certain image.
“It was kind of hard for me to come out,” 
Gay said.
Gay had a girlfriend throughout high 
school and college but said he knew he had feelings for men.
“But I didn’t know how to act on it,” he 
said.
Brown and Gay met at Walmart when 
the two were in high school, but their ro-mance didn’t blossom until later.
After a monthlong split from Brown, 
Gay said he finally realized he knew what he wanted.
“I knew when I told my mom she was go-ing to tell the rest of the world,” Gay said.
Brown had a similar problem and waited 
until after college to come out.
“I felt like my uniqueness was being hid-
den,” Brown said. “There comes a point in your life when you feel like you’re not living to the fullest.”
After the struggle of telling their fami-
lies, Brown and Gay became Internet sensa-tions for publicizing their wedding. Within a week of their wedding video being put on the Internet, it received about 2,000 views, 
Gay said.
Gay and Brown talked to a crowd of 
about 40 people, addressing how more pub-
lic figures are opening up about their sexu-ality and the importance of love no matter who it’s with.
Dashari Kearse, a 19-year-old UF explor-
atory student, said he was inspired.
“For a community like ours, it’s the first 
time that me and everyone else can see our own happy ending,” Kearse said.Gay couple talks love, race“At the end of the day,

Brandy Burgess, associate director of

Berner, a 21-year-old UF geography se-nior, said the two groups are coordinating a zombie dress-up contest, where the winner will have the opportunity to meet Brooks.
“I’m actually a really big Max Brooks 
fan,” he said. “I have (two) of his books and I’ve read them multiple times.”
Brooks said his survival guide was based 
on real-world research and solutions. After he saw people liked his book, he started go-ing on the road and doing talks about zom-bie survival.
His tips on how to 
survive an apocalypse of 
walking flesh eaters are applicable for any crisis, not just ones that involve 
the undead, he said.
He said when people 
ask him if he has a zom-

he grew up in Los Angeles — except he called it an earthquake bag back then.

lypse, you’re really ready for any disaster,” he said.Author visiting campus dead

Pranksters are no 
‘Animal House’
Tuesday, we ran a story about a group of freshmen boys — 
of course — whose pranks at Broward Hall prompted the installment of surveillance cameras on their ﬂ  oor.
Along with a photo of the pranksters — who’ve dubbed 
themselves the “Eastside Boys” — some ﬂ  ashing peace signs 
and sporting blazers with no shirts on underneath, was a list of 
their acts: shredding the posters and door tags made by their RA, stealing signs from construction sites, and stapling thongs and used condoms to the ﬂ  oor’s bulletin board.
One of them said they wanted to be “the ﬂ  oor that goes 
down in history.”
Sorry, boys, but you’re going to have to try a little harder. 
If anyone goes down in Broward Hall history, it’s going to be the guy responsible for the drunkenly-pooping-in-the-oven in-
cident of the 2011-12 academic year.
No criminal action was reported in connection to the gang — 
just a bunch of obnoxious, unoriginal, low-grade shenanigans.
On the surface, the incident with the Eastside Boys — which 
is impossible to write without cringing, for the record — may 
smack of National Lampoon’s “Animal House.” They seem similar at ﬁ  rst: a group of raucous college guys behaving badly with no regard of consequences, cost to the university or the sanity of those around them.
However, upon closer inspection, the freshmen of Broward 
Hall and the men of Delta couldn’t be more different.
“Animal House,” like many other National Lampoon mov-
ies and, years later, movies from the 1980s by directors such as John Hughes, emphasized a difference between the wealthy, stodgy types in the ﬁ  ctional university’s administration and the rebellious, uncouth members of the Delta fraternity. When John Belushi and co. acted out, it was a calculated effort to un-dermine the stuffy, old-fashioned reign of authority the snooty 
Omegas and the university’s evil president held.
But trashing a dorm with your bros simply because you ﬁ  nd 
it funny? Not so cool.
Chalk it up to youthful naiveté: The boys quoted in the ar-
ticle were all fresh-faced 18-year-olds, blissfully unaware that 
in this age, incidents like this don’t fade away after the security cameras are installed and the slaps on the wrists are adminis-tered.
As veterans of the residence halls, we are asking the — ugh, 
one more time — Eastside Boys to cool it. The RAs and other residence hall staff members aren’t paid enough to deal with your childish games. We’re happy to hear that fraternity re-cruitment has hindered your pranking, but the fact that your stupidity culminated in the installment of security cameras is disheartening nonetheless.
We get that you’re away from mom’s watchful eye, but re-
member: You’re living in a veritable ant farm with hundreds of other students in close proximity to you. One of the lessons 
you’ll learn in college, aside from time management and how to 
mitigate hangovers, is how to be decent human beings. Stapling 
your used condoms to the community bulletin board for all to 
see doesn’t constitute decent human behavior.UF’s Accent is rife with corruption
A strange set of events unfolded last week. In just 
hours, all 1,700 tickets were taken. The next day, an eager audience packed the Phillips Center for 
the Performing Arts to listen to the words of a frail 84-year-old speaker. Who was this old geezer?
The New Yorker calls him the “devil’s accountant.” A global phenom, Noam Chomsky is the world’s 
most cited living author and a renowned champion of human rights.  
But, unknown to most of the public, there was much 
drama in bringing Chomsky. 
Before I continue, here’s a disclosure: I’m a member 
of Islam on Campus (IOC), a Muslim student group.
Initially, Accent Speaker’s Bureau — the student  
speaker’s bureau at UF — seemed interested in sponsor-ing Chomsky, but this Fall, they backed out of the event, 
giving a litany of excuses. IOC quickly seized the oppor-
tunity and offered to sponsor Chomsky.
Soon it became clear that IOC’s enthusiasm was not 
shared. 
In a weird turn of events, the Student Activities and 
Involvement staff called IOC members to a meeting — I was present there — where the head of Accent explained why bringing Chomsky was ill-advised. 
After days of haggling, IOC gave up on the sponsor-
ship attempt.
Accent is no joke — its nearly half-million-dollar bud-
get comes entirely from our student fees. On a campus with more women than men, only once in its 46-year his-tory has a female led Accent. Since 1990, the chairman-
ship of the bureau has always been given to men of the 
same fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi, with rare exceptions.
I wish the reports of our Student Government having 
a fetish for the medieval tradition of “legacy positions” 
were just conspiracy theories. 
Apparently, this is old news. The 1992-93 chairman of 
Accent, an alumnus of AEPi, confessed to The Gainesville Sun in 2010: “There is nepotism, 
but it’s nepotism with qualiﬁ  ed candidates.”
Once again, a member of 
AEPi was chosen this year to lead Accent. 
You begin to realize why so 
many absurd excuses were giv-en for not bringing Chomsky: 
After all, what can we expect of a university that doesn’t care to reﬂ  ect our Student Body’s vast diversity?
Don’t expect the Center for Student Activities and In-
volvement to lose any sleep over the cronyism. 
The center’s director, Nancy Chrystal-Green, told The 
Gainesville Sun in 2010 that the administration didn’t want to meddle in such student affairs.
To ensure I would not be dissuaded from writing on 
this, I avoided talking to IOC members about this prob-lem. 
Minority organizations at UF are in no position to 
voice grievances — the risk of retribution from SG can 
be enough to silence most groups.
With no end in sight to the nepotism, the Gator Na-
tion has lost much conﬁ  dence in UF’s extracurricular 
scene. 
Every year, some concerned students try to ﬁ  x the sys-
tem through the ballot box. And every year, they fail.
This much is clear: For the thousands of UF students 
who don’t belong to exclusive cliques, the situation has become unbearable. 
Perhaps the university needs to appoint a task force 
to tackle the corruption before lawsuits and national headlines are made. 
I honestly don’t know the solution, but if you do, 
please speak up.

RTS website is useless
After living in Gainesville for three 
months, I can say without equivocation that 
the bus system here is an utter failure. I can-
not count how many times the bus drivers and the website have failed me. Apparently, 
I live in a Bermuda Triangle of bus sched-
uling. One morning a particular bus comes at 8:40. Another, it’s not there until 9:05 a.m. How could a schedule have a 25-minute window of error? When their website tells 
me I have 15 minutes to get to my stop, that 
means the bus will ﬂ  y by in ﬁ  ve with me standing 10 yards away and the driver be-ing too rude to wait for me. Their refusal to pick up customers, I feel, has little to do with 
their desire to follow the letter of some rule. 
Something has to change with this system.

During a recent discussion with medi-cal students at the University of Lou-isville, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) inad-
vertently gave rare insight into the political strategy employed by him and his fellow Tea Party politicians.
Paul was asked if he had any advice for 
the students to succeed on their upcoming exam.
“Actually, I do,” Paul responded. “I nev-
er, ever cheated. I don’t condone cheating. But I would sometimes spread misinforma-tion. This is a great tactic. Misinformation can be very important.”
Paul explained that when he was a medi-
cal student, he and his friends would spread false rumors about the content of upcoming exams in order to sabotage the scores of their peers.
He is far from alone among American 
conservatives in his advocacy of spreading lies for personal gain. Paul’s Tea Party allies have wholeheartedly embraced the use of misinformation and outright lies to advance their political beliefs.
Examples of distortion of the truth by 
conservative politicians and media ﬁ  gures abound.Recently, Sean Hannity, host 
of “Hannity” on the Fox News Channel, invited a number of ordinary Americans, members of the middle class and small-business owners to be guests on his show. Hannity brought on these individuals to share their economic struggles, which the guests claimed were a result of the Afford-able Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care reform law.
In one case, business owner Paul Cox and 
his wife, Michelle, claimed they had been forced to cut back on their employees’ hours because of increased costs resulting from the Affordable Care Act. Another guest, Al-lison Denijs, complained that her insurance company dropped her policy and plans to replace it with a new one, which she claimed would cause problems for her family and in-crease their ﬁ  nancial burden.
Salon’s Eric Stern did some investigative 
work and found that all of Hannity’s Af-fordable Care Act “horror stories” were ut-ter fabrications. Stern discovered Cox’s com-pany only has four employees, far below the threshold of 50 employees that would require his business to provide health insurance to his workers.
Stern also found that the 
insurance policy that would replace Denij’s old plan would cost her family about $7,600, “a 60 percent reduction from what they would have to pay on the pre-Obamacare market.”
According to Stern’s report, not a single 
one of Hannity’s guests had even visited the new federal health care exchange web-site, healthcare.gov, to explore their insur-ance options and determine how much they would have to pay under the new law.
Hannity’s exploitation of the guests on 
his show in an attempt to demonize Obama-care is a prime example of how prominent conservatives use deception and misinfor-mation to advance their political goals.
The use of misinformation and deception 
by the conservative right is also reﬂ  ected by the false beliefs of conservatives and Tea Party supporters regarding the economy and the federal budget deﬁ  cit.
Al Hunt of Bloomberg, citing a recent 
poll, said “two-thirds of regular Republicans believe the federal budget deﬁ  cit has grown this year and 93 percent of Tea Party Repub-licans agree.”
As Hunt points out, this claim is com-
pletely false. The federal budget deﬁ  cit in 2012 was $1.1 trillion. In 2013, that deﬁ  cit will shrink tremendously to just $642 billion, its lowest level since 2008.
These false beliefs about the state of our 
economy and budget abound among voters sympathetic to the Tea Party because they are constantly reinforced by conservative politicians and media ﬁ  gures. Conservative congressmen and senators rail against the supposedly socialist, oppressive and over-spending Obama administration, making claims that have absolutely no grounding in reality.
In order to resolve the challenges that 
confront our nation, our political debates must be conducted in a manner that respects facts, logic and evidence-based reasoning. The embrace of misinformation by Tea Party Republicans and the lies to advance their political agenda undermine the American political process.

opinions@alligator.orgThis column is a response to 
a guest column published in the Alligator: “Palestinians are people with a voice”
Anat Berko is a world-renowned 
terrorism expert who has lectured before Congress, the Department 
of State, the FBI and NATO. Berko lec-tures before these important individuals 
because of her unique research and expe-
riences. Last week, UF was lucky enough to have the chance to hear Berko speak about her interactions and research with attempted suicide bombers. She studies the relationships and lives leading up to the event in which these individuals were strapped with explosives. Her lecture was eye-opening, thought-provoking and ex-
ceptional.  
Unfortunately, while she was speaking, 
three students stood up holding signs that 
claimed, “Hamas is not the problem.”
Additionally, they rudely started 
speaking over her in an attempt to distract students from the lecture. These same stu-dents, who were asked by Berko to stay and listen, immediately left and published 
an op-ed about an hour-and-a-half-long 
event they only attended for 10 minutes.
If these students had listened to Berko’s 
lecture, they would have heard her state, “This lecture is not about the Israeli-Pales-tinian conﬂ  ict. It’s purely on the research I have conducted.”
They would have heard her examples 
of women and children suicide bombers 
— only one was Palestinian. Instead of 
asking questions, they interrupted and were disrespectful.
Farah, Rami and Eric stated that Berko “uses the very personal anec-dotes of women to justify the massively oppressive actions 
of Israel.”
Israel was never men-
tioned in the lecture except once — to tell a 
story of a bombing that almost happened there. If these students had stayed and listened to the lecture, they would have understood that Berko’s life is dedicated to listening to the stories of these women. If anyone is trying to show that “Palestin-
ians are actual human beings,” it’s Berko, 
who tries to explain why these women ﬁ  nd themselves in these situations, clari-fying that they don’t just wake up one day and become suicide bombers.
Moreover, “Less Hamas, More Hum-
mus” is not offensive. Hamas is a recog-nized Islamist terrorist group that focuses its attention on creating chaos and send-
ing missiles into Israel instead of helping 
Gaza grow. These students claim Israel is the sole reason the Palestinian people are lacking human rights. However, the people living in Gaza are often stripped of these rights by Hamas. In 2010, Hamas shut down six human rights groups’ of-ﬁ  ces. Among these organizations were a women’s health society and the Woman 
and Child Development Association.
Next time there’s a speaker on cam-
pus, you should listen. Listening is the 
only way to achieve peace. Berko was an amazing speaker, and I‘m thankful to the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, UF Hillel and the ICC for bringing her to campus.

Speaking OutStanley Kubrick was one 
of the most evocative and accomplished directors in 
history. Even his worst movies were great, and his best movies 
pushed ﬁ  lmmaking into territory that was 
previously unthinkable. Even in death, he continues to inﬂ  uence directors and writers, and people still debate what his ﬁ  lms mean to this day. He also secretly directed the Apollo 11 moon landing.  
The ﬁ  rst time this theory surfaced was in 
2002 with the documentary “Dark Side of the Moon,” directed by William Karel. It claimed 
that Richard Nixon’s CIA recruited Kubrick 
to oversee the creation of fake moon-landing footage.  
They were desperate to gain an advantage 
over the Soviet Union, and, real or not, beat-ing them to the moon was a victory.  
The theory cites Kubrick’s Academy 
Award-winning visual effects used in “2001: A Space Odyssey” as experimentation and 
development of the techniques used to create 
the false moon-landing footage.  
The idea that Kubrick was involved in the 
moon landing did not gain traction, though.  
Moon-landing conspiracy theories are al-
ready on the fringe of popular thought, and adding Kubrick to the mix makes something that was already dubious at best seem abso-lutely insane.  
Other than his production of a space-
themed movie in 1968, there is no connec-tion.
At least, that’s how the situation appeared 
to be until 2011, when Jay Weidner released his documentary “Kubrick’s Odyssey: Secrets Hidden in the Films of Stanley Kubrick.” His claims were no different from those of other theorists — he just had proof.Proof of the Apollo/Ku-
brick conspiracy, he said, can be found in Kubrick’s 1980 horror masterpiece “The Shining.”  
While the ﬁ  lm has been sub-
ject to many interpretations — most of which claim that it’s about the destruction of the Native Americans — Weidner believes “The Shining” was Kubrick’s secret confession to being involved in Apollo 11.  
He describes his theory further in the 2012 
documentary “Room 237,” which brought together several people to give their interpre-tation of “The Shining.”  
His segment of the ﬁ  lm uses differences 
between the original book and the movie — there are many — and other clues to prove his point.  
Kubrick was known for perfectionism 
that came close to insanity, so the documen-tary’s theorists assume that every detail in his ﬁ  lms, including “The Shining,” is intentional and full of meaning.  
When Weidner sees Danny Lloyd stand 
up in an Apollo 11 sweater on top of a carpet pattern that looks like a launchpad, he sees proof enough for his theory. Weidner has “The Shining” act as a metaphor for the tur-moil Kubrick went through to fake the moon landing.  
He has other clues, too. The ghostly twins represent the Gemini 
missions, and the haunted Room 237 exists because there are 237,000 miles between the moon and the earth — even though it’s actu-ally 238,855 miles, but why split hairs?  
The evidence is there, and the explanation 
makes sense.  
The truth has been revealed. Alec Carver is a UF journalism freshman.

A UF student is putting a twist on fund-
raising by donating half the proceeds from 
her at-home hair business to fund breast can-cer research.
This month, Victoria Esiobu, a 20-year-
old UF health education and behavior junior, is holding a campaign she’s dubbed the Do Your Hair, Be Aware fundraiser.
“I realize that women love to get their hair 
done, and a lot of women that have breast cancer lose their hair,” Esiobu said. “So we might as well get our hair done for a cause.”
Esiobu said since she began the fundraiser 
Oct. 1, she’s received a high number of cus-tomers seeking to get their hair done.
If it goes well, she will continue to raise money for other awareness causes through-out the year such as Sickle Cell Awareness Month, she said.
She specializes in African-American hair-
styles such as braids and extensions. Her prices range from $30 to $90, depending on the hairstyle, she said.
Esiobu began her business during high 
school when she started doing her class-mates’ hair and charging fees. Once she moved to Gainesville, she gained clientele through referrals from friends.
Chelsea Ogugua, a 19-year-old UF sociol-
ogy sophomore, said she’s had her hair done by Esiobu multiple times. Ogugua said Es-iobu is great at accommodating her clients’ 
schedules.
When she found out Esiobu was donating 
proceeds to breast cancer research, she im-
mediately wanted to help.
Although Esiobu has no family members 
who have been affected by breast cancer, she said she’s done a lot of research about the disease. She’s also active in Women of Respect, Achievement, Perseverance and 
Service, a UF organization that’s encourag-
ing its members to implement creative ideas to raise money for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.Camila Camargo, a 19-year-old UF pre-
nursing sophomore and an executive-board member for the organization, said it hopes to raise a minimum of $250 for the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk, which it will be participating in downtown on Satur-
day.
Each committee within the organization 
has created a fundraising project and will 
compete with one another to raise the most money. The committee that raises the most money will receive a prize.
For example, Camargo said the public 
relations committee members will be hold-ing an event on Turlington Plaza. They will 
distribute pink balloons with breast cancer-
related sayings in exchange for donations.
Esiobu said she plans to raise $100 during 
her hairstyling fundraiser this month.

In the frenzy of Halloween-
themed sugary treats, some 
UF health experts are urging parents to pay attention to their children’s teeth and candy col-
lections.  
Karina Miller, a pediatric 
dentist at UF Health Shands 
Hospital, recommended avoid-ing sticky or liquid candies due to their tendency to stick in children’s teeth. She said she instead prefers fruit snack gum-mies but cautioned all candy 
contains sugar.
“There is no ‘better’ candy,” 
Miller said.
Monica Lefkof, a 21-year-
old UF pre-dental food science 
and human nutrition senior, agreed that consuming consis-
tent amounts of sugar is a habit 
worth reforming.
“I used to be a big sweets 
eater but not anymore,” she said.
Miller said the Halloween 
season does not appear to spark a direct increase in doctors’ vis-its. But some dentists offer to 
buy back kids’ stashes of candy 
for $1 a pound to reduce the number of cavities, Time maga-zine reported.
Linda Bobroff, a UF nutri-
tion and health professor, also  advised parents to check the candy their children collect.
“What parents can do is look 
at it, and if anything is open, tampered with, then they can just throw it out,” Bobroff said. “When in doubt, throw it out.”Halloween has scary

A group of Gators carved 
pumpkins to celebrate Halloween 
— except they did it underwater.
The Gator Scuba Club traveled 
to Blue Grotto Dive Resort in Wil-liston to carve their jack-o’-lan-terns, a tradition that has recently 
been brought back after skipping 
the event last year.
Vice president Sean Deeb, a 
21-year-old UF marine sciences senior, said group members re-
moved the pumpkin guts and 
drew their designs above the wa-ter.
Miranda Gingold, a 21-year-
old UF biology senior and club member, said the divers weighed down the pumpkins so they wouldn’t float away.
But the team wasn’t alone un-
derwater.
“There was this annoying turtle that kept trying to eat our pump-
kins, so that was funny,” Gingold 
said.
However, even with a calendar 
full of events, the club has seen 
clearer conditions.
“All the officers are graduat-
ing, so we need new faces,” Gin-
gold said.
The club has lost members in 
the past year over what Deeb re-fers to as financial complications and executive-board members’ issues with timing. This year, 
though, the club is finally seeing 
the number of new members re-turn to where it was three years ago.
“It’s hard to get the word out about it. Our events are not cam-
pus-based,” Deeb said. “I don’t 
think it’s anything people inquire about.”
Currently, the club is focus-
ing on tabling at different events 
around campus to improve its 
membership.
To spike interest, Deeb said he 
is trying to secure guest speakers 
and plan new events.
“We are really starting to re-
build the club,” he said. “I think 
it’s a really cool time to be in-volved with Scuba Club.”
Cindy Medina, a 21-year-old 
UF microbiology senior, is in a scuba class and said she is looking forward to joining the club once 
she is certified.
“It will provide the perfect scu-
ba community to dive with,” Me-
dina said. “This is especially im-portant since scuba is a sport that 
relies heavily on diving in groups 
and with a buddy.”Scuba Club membership resurfacing

The city of Gainesville has made 
Leslie Knope proud.
Gainesville’s Department of Parks, 
Recreation and Cultural Affairs re-
cently received accreditation from the 
National Recreation and Park Asso-ciation. The department had to meet 142 standards before it could receive 
the national seal of approval, said 
Steve Phillips, department director.
Some of the benchmarks include 
clear and effective policies, good 
foresight in planning, direction for 
management and well-structured ad-
ministration, according to the Com-mission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies.
The accreditation was final-
ized when the department received its award earlier this month at the NRPA’s Congress and Exposition in Houston. It is one of 13 agencies 
across the nation accredited this year, 
and it is one of 23 agencies in Florida 
that has received the accreditation.
“It’s a very significant accomplish-
ment,” said Lauren Hoffman, spokes-
woman for the National Recreation and Park Association. “It’s a real proof that the agency is excelling at what they’re doing in their commu-
nity.”
Jennifer Gelfand, a program co-
ordinator with the city, said securing 
accreditation was tedious.
“For us, it just means that we are 
doing that job, and we are at that lev-el,” Gelfand said.
The department must reapply for 
accreditation every five years.Parks get national honor“All the officers are

� BIKES AND MORE, 8TH AVE. BIKE & COFFEE 
HOUSE AND SWIFT CYCLE PARTICIPATE.  
ANA FAJARDO
Alligator Contributing Writer
With an abundance of bike lanes and trails around 
town, weekly group bike rides hosted by local shops 
have become an avenue for cyclists to socialize as 
well as a healthy incentive to pedal faster.
At Bikes and More, closing up shop doesn’t nec-
essarily mean employees rush home immediately.
Austin Joiner, an employee at the shop at 2133 NW 
Sixth St., said staff members spontaneously go for 
joyrides after closing. They’ll call friends to see who is available to join, and after the ride, they go back to the shop to hang out and drink beer together.
The shop also organizes Sunday morning racing 
team road rides and Wednesday evening mountain bike rides through town. The mountain bike group usually has about seven to 15 participants, Joiner said.
Similarly, the 8th Ave. Bike & Coffee House, 235 
NW Eighth Ave., recently added a Tuesday Night Sweaty Ride to its schedule. The shop also holds a Sunday Recovery Ride to Micanopy, and Ride and Dine on Thursday nights.“The distinctive factor of leading a ride out of 
Eighth Avenue is that it’s more accessible to every-one in the community,” said Ali Brody, a shop em-
ployee.
Apart from the weekly ride schedule, the shop 
has held an Espresso Social, during which partici-
pants rode around town sampling coffee from local shops, and the Amour Chat Alleycat, a couples team 
bike scavenger hunt.
Swift Cycle, located at 607 W. University Ave., 
also contributes to the cycling community calen-
dar. A group ride departs from the shop at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday mornings, said Keith Richards, one of 
the owners.
Though local bike shops are competitors in the 
market, Richards said the employees are friends 
across businesses.  
That’s how Ryan Aulton, the 32-year-old co-own-
er of 8th Ave. Bike & Coffee House, sees the com-munity bike rides.
“It’s just riding, having fun, chitchatting,” he 
said.Bike culture taking off in Gainesville

Gators in the MLB
Former Florida catcher David Ross and the Boston 
Red Sox begin the 2013 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals tonight at 8:07 on FOX.Freshman Alex Holston is a focal point on offense for the Florida volleyball team. Read the story on page 14.JONATHAN CZUPRYN

Required to sit out the 2012-
2013 season after transferring 
from Virginia Tech, Dorian 
Finney-Smith dedicated the off 
year to adding muscle, shooting at the peak of his jump and com-pleting every task Billy Donovan 
asked him to do.
But with just more than two 
weeks until Finney-Smith makes 
his debut with the Gators, Dono-van said the former four-star re-
cruit and Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence All-Freshman team selection has his work cut out for him.
“I think he’s just been OK,” 
Donovan said. 
“There’s a lot of expectations 
on him. I think when you get a chance to see and be around a player every single day, espe-
cially for a year, you kind of have 
an idea (of) strengths and weak-nesses and areas that they’ve got to get better in.”
When he originally committed 
to Virginia Tech, the 6-foot-8 for-ward was ranked 31st on Rivals.com’s top-150 recruits of 2011. 
Even with Finney-Smith, who 
was coach Seth Greenberg’s high-est-rated recruit during his ten-ure at Virginia Tech, the Hokies failed to make the NCAA Tour-
nament for a fifth straight year.
Greenberg was fired and Finney-Smith decided to find a new home in Gainesville.
“I just wish I’d signed with 
Florida out of high school,” 
Finney-Smith told the school’s 
website in February. 
“Can’t do nothing about it 
now, though, but practice hard 
and wait for my time to get here.”
Now that Finney-Smith’s time 
has come, Donovan said the red-shirt sophomore is going to feel the pressure right out of the gate 
because the Gators lost three top 
scorers  from last year’s squad. 
Florida has also been ham-
pered by injuries to Will Yeguete and Eli Carter. Scottie Wilbekin 
will serve an indefinite suspen-
sion to begin the season, leav-ing Finney-Smith with an even heavier burden.
“Now where a lot of those 
guys are gone, and we’re dealing with some injuries, there’s been more fallen on his plate,” Dono-van said. 
“And I don’t want to say he 
has not handled that well, but I do think he’s got to get better.”
Despite making the ACC All-
Freshman team for the 2011-2012 season, Finney-Smith averaged 
just 6.3 points per game while 
shooting 33 percent from the field. 
Donovan said Finney-Smith 
should not feel pressure to score because that is not who he is as 
a player. 
But Donovan added that the 
forward will need to prove he 
can move up and down the court

After eight runners had career-best 
days at the Wisconsin adidas Invitation-
al on Saturday, the Gators are feeling a sense of assurance as they prepare for the Southeastern Conference Champi-
onships.
“To come off a race like that, for most 
everybody to run lifetime bests and do it 
in a really tough field, it definitely gives them a lot of confidence,” coach Paul Spangler said.
A record-breaking run by senior 
Mark Parrish and performances by ju-nior Jimmy Clark and redshirt senior 
Agata Strausa that cracked the top-10 
in Florida history paved the way for Florida at the adidas Invitational, a meet Spangler dubbed “arguably the most competitive cross country meet outside the NCAA Championships.” 
However, less-experienced runners 
have also helped fuel the Gators as they prepare for the SEC Championships, which will be held in Gainesville on Nov. 1.
For the women, 
the extra boost need-ed to stay at the top of the SEC comes from sophomore Julie Macedo and fresh-
man Taylor Tubbs.
Macedo and Tubbs have been two 
of the top-four runners for the women 
in every meet this season, filling a void 
created earlier this year by the absence of redshirt junior Cory McGee and injuries to seniors Stephanie Strasser and Shelby Hayes.New runners provide depthSoCCeR
MICHELLE PROVENZANO
Alligator Writer @mmprovenzano
Annie Speese’s first goal of the season 
was impressive.
The junior midfielder took a free kick 
following an LSU foul in its attacking third 
and curved a shot past a wall of defenders from 20 yards out.
Speese’s goal, which came in the 62nd 
minute, finalized the Gators’ second con-secutive 3-0 shutout.
“Getting that goal kind of just took a 
little bit of pressure off of me,” Speese said. “Obviously, one of my roles on the team is 
to contribute with scoring goals and having 
not been able to do that in the start of the season was a little frustrating.”
Speese has been an offensive weapon 
since her freshman season in 2011. She scored eight goals her debut season — one was a game-winning goal —  before tally-ing six more as sophomore.
As a junior, Speese has spent more time 
getting teammates involved. In 16 games, she has six assists — three shy of her career high in a season. She led UF with nine as-sists in 2011.
Coach Becky Burleigh 
said Speese’s free-kick ability could prove help-ful against physical oppo-nents.
“If a team wants to stop 
us by fouling us, then we need to be dangerous,” 
Burleigh said. “With the 
people who do take free kicks, when they’re 
dangerous, teams have to think twice about 
using that as a strategy. Annie has been re-ally good at practice with free kicks, so I was really happy to see her score because Junior scores first goal of ‘13

THE RALLY
Phillip: Now that we are mid-
way through the season, there is one thing certain about the 
Heisman Trophy race — it will be 
dominated by quarterbacks.
There are many choices, but the 
clear-cut favorite is Marcus Mariota.
Oregon’s sophomore signal-caller 
has dazzled in 2013 and will shatter the 
impressive numbers he compiled as a freshman. Through seven games, Mariota is completing 62.4 percent of his passes and has thrown 19 touchdowns.
His running proﬁ  ciency is even more impressive.Mariota has gained 10.1 yards per rush attempt this season 
and has scored nine touchdowns on the ground, including a jaw-dropping 71-yard dash against Virginia.
Thanks in large part to his absurd start to the season, No. 3 
Oregon is in position to play for a national title when Florida State turns in its usual choke-job performance later this season.
Did I mention that Mariota has thrown exactly zero intercep-
tions this season? Your boy Blaine Gabbert can’t even say that after most ﬁ  rst quarters. Give this man the hardware.
Joe: You can make fun of my Jaguars all you want, but Tom 
Brady threw the same number of touchdown passes for your beloved Patriots last Sunday as Gabbert did while sidelined with a hamstring injury — none.
(Chad Henne also had zero. Man, being a Jags fan really 
makes my Sundays miserable.)
More than making up for the lack of production from Bra-
dy and Gabbert (and Henne) last weekend was No. 2 Florida State’s redshirt freshman phenom Jameis Winston — the clear-cut frontrunner to win the Heisman Trophy.
Winston enjoyed his best performance yet in his ﬁ  rst ma-
jor test last Saturday, leading the Seminoles to a signature win against formerly third-ranked Clemson. The redshirt freshman silenced a hostile crowd in Death Valley with 444 passing yards and four total touchdowns in the Seminoles’ blowout victory.
Even more impressive was Winston’s efﬁ  ciency. He led FSU 
to three touchdown drives against the Tigers that lasted 1:39 or less.
The rise of “Famous Jameis” hasn’t even taken that long. At 
this rate, the Heisman Trophy might win him at season’s end.
Phillip: You leave Brady out of this. You would be off your 
game, too, if you were coming home to Gisele Bundchen every night. He can hang it up any time he wants and go down as one of the ﬁ  ve best quarterbacks to ever play.
Besides, Gabbert’s QBR is 1.8. The next lowest is Josh Free-
man at 18.9. That is damning. Can’t the Jaguars just leave Gab-bert in London this week? Would anyone really care?
Anyway, if you want to argue about who is the most efﬁ  -cient quarterback, you have to give the nod to Mariota. 
He has been so good — and Oregon 
has been so dominant — that prior to playing Washington two weekends 
ago, he had not played in the fourth 
quarter of any game this season. That’s just ridiculous.
Imagine what his numbers would 
look like if he had even more time to 
shred these helpless defenses?
Sure, Winston is phenomenal. Considering he is a redshirt 
freshman, the start to his career is almost unprecedented. But he can’t beat opposing defenses in as many ways as the incredibly 
versatile Mariota can.
If Oregon’s sophomore sensation continues putting up these 
eye-popping numbers when the Ducks face the brunt of their 
schedule — spoiler: he will — there is no chance the voters turn him down. It doesn’t matter how famous Jameis is these days.
Joe: I’m not even worried about the Blaine Train anymore. 
My heart is set on another Heisman candidate — Louisville’s Teddy Bridgewater. #TankForTeddy!
Jameis is more famous than Mariota — and my beloved 
Teddy — because, like this Rally posits, he’s performed better against better competition so far.
The best defense the Ducks have faced this season is Vir-
ginia’s, which ranks 47th nationally with 377.6 yards allowed per game. Florida State has already faced three teams ranked higher than that with four more on the way, including Florida’s fourth-ranked unit.
(UVA, by the way, has surrendered 83 points and 978 yards 
of total offense in home losses to Ball State and Duke this sea-
son.)
There’s no telling how Mariota will do in back-to-back games 
against No. 12 UCLA and No. 6 Stanford. Until he (very likely) 
does what he’s been doing against teams like the Bruins and the Cardinal, he can take a backseat to the amazing Winston.
Facing better competition, Winston has actually improved 
an offense that lost starting quarterback EJ Manuel while facing tougher opponents.
Quarterbacking the nation’s ﬁ  fth-ranked offense, Winston 
ranks among the top seven FBS signal-callers with a 71.3 com-pletion percentage, 12 yards per pass attempt, 20 touchdown passes, a 210.4 passer rating and a 92.5 QBR.
Mariota ranks right up there with Winston in each of those 
categories, but there’s no denying that the redshirt freshman has faced tougher competition so far.
The Heisman race is tight between these frontrunners, but 
based on each quarterback’s body of work so far in 2013, Win-ston leads by a tomahawk chop.Who deserves to win the Heisman Trophy? 
� RIGHT-SIDE HITTER HAS 175 KILLS IN 2013.
ERICA A. HERNANDEZ
Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa
Alex Holston played well in high school, but 
she never thought her success would translate 
to the college game so quickly. 
Florida’s freshman right-side hitter has prov-
en to be a valuable contributor already this sea-son.
“I think it’s crazy; I never really imagined 
it,” Holston said. “I didn’t know these games were so huge like that, but I think they’re a lot of fun.” 
Holston received more than 40 offers to play 
college volleyball, but she said she committed 
to Florida in September of 2011 because of its 
rigorous Southeastern Conference schedule.
In Florida’s loss to Missouri — the Gators’ 
ﬁ  rst loss in more than a month after winning 13 consecutive matches — Holston outplayed her teammates and competitors with a career-high 17 kills. 
She also recorded a hitting percentage of 
.583, second only to Missouri freshman middle blocker Julia Towler, who notched a .667 clip during the match. 
“It is nerve wracking,” Holston said of play-
ing against elite opponents. “I usually get ner-vous in the locker room. 
“But then by the time we’re warming and 
running around the court, I’m ﬁ  ne and I know that I’m where I need to be and that I can start 
focusing on the game.” 
Holston’s nerves have not held her back this 
season. 
After she helped Florida sweep Texas A&M 
and Alabama during the ﬁ  rst weekend of Oc-
tober, she was named the SEC Freshman of the Week. 
Holston totaled 18 kills with just one error in 
each of the matches.
“Alex has been great for us week after week,” 
coach Mary Wise said Monday. 
“I think after this past weekend, I can’t imag-
ine her staying under the radar as some people have had her.”
During a home match against Kentucky on 
Oct. 11, Holston outplayed Gators redshirt se-
nior middle blocker Chloe Mann. 
Mann recorded a hitting percentage of .647 
and 11 kills, while Holston notched a .667 clip 
and 13 kills. 
Mann, a ﬁ  fth-year senior, and Holston, a true 
freshman, have teamed to create a formidable duo for the Gators. 
“She (has) come in and done her role know-
ing the game plan,” Mann said. “Just really 
showing the nation how amazing she is every 
time she comes on the court.”Holston proving

one third-place

Alex Holston
UF right-side hitter“Whenever you have an athlete go 
down, you’re looking for someone to fill 
that spot,” Spangler said. “Taylor and Ju-lie did a great job of that on the women’s side.”
Although McGee and Hayes returned 
to the lineup Saturday, the underclassmen maintained their success. Tubbs was the third Gator to cross the finish line on the Thomas Zimmer Championship course with a time of 21:15; Macedo finished one second behind her. Both ran personal-best races in Madison, Wis.
“Taylor and I work really well together,” 
Macedo said. “Where I have weaknesses, she is strong and vice versa.”
On the men’s side, junior Eddie Garcia 
and freshman Carlos Miranda are two run-ners who have caught Spangler’s eye this season. 
Garcia finished in the top three for the 
Gators in each meet he has participated in this season.
“Eddie’s a guy who really had a break-
through season,” Spangler said. “It was a good race for him. I think he’s got some-thing more in the tank.”
Miranda broke the 25-minute barrier for 
the first time in his career on Saturday, a feat that Spangler takes in high regard.
“He was willing to do anything you 
ask of him,” he said of the three-time SEC 
Freshman of the Week. “That’s a big reason 
why he’s improved as much as he has and a big reason why I think he’s going to be really good as the years progress.”
Their consistency, along with Parrish, 
Clark, and junior JL Hines, will be pivotal for the men as they try to improve on their fifth-place finish in Nashville, Tenn., at last year’s SEC Championships and overtake 
reigning champion Arkansas.
“As always, it’s going to be a dog fight,” 
Spangler said. 
“There are very, very good teams in the 
SEC and we’ve just got to put ourselves in a 
position where we can contend for a title.”
she has put a lot of work into becoming better at that.”
Speese’s free-kick prowess is nothing new. She scored on 
a 23-yard free kick in a loss to UCF in the second round of 
the 2011 NCAA Tournament. 
The junior also dabbles with bicycle kicks, but those are 
for her own entertainment.
“That’s more just messing around,” Speese said. “We definitely promote creativity in the way that we 
play, so you never know what could happen in the attack-ing third.”
Florida travels to play Tennessee on Friday night be-
fore returning to face Texas A&M at home Sunday. With just three matches remaining in the regular season, Speese 
knows she and the Gators must take advantage of every op-
portunity they are given — especially on the road.
“We know Tennessee is fighting to get in the tournament, 
so we know they’re going to give us a really tough game,” 
she said. “They always do.”and grab rebounds like he did in his first 
year.
Finney-Smith finished his lone sea-
son in Blacksburg, Va., averaging seven rebounds per game — 10th most in the ACC.
“He has the ability to impact the game 
with his defense,” Donovan said. 
“He has the ability to impact the game 
with his rebounding. But I think he needs to play with a much better motor. He needs to impact practice a lot more with 
his motor.”
With non-conference tests in the form 
of Wisconsin, Florida State, UConn and 
Kansas coming within the first 10 games 
of the season, Donovan wants to temper 
the expectations regarding Finney-Smith.
“The first thing — I’ve dealt with this 
with (Mike) Rosario and (Vernon) Mack-lin — when a guy transfers in here and 
he’s very decorated coming out of high 
school like those guys have been, what happens is sometimes when people don’t watch a guy play for a year, their legend 
grows by leaps and bounds of how good 
they actually are,” Donovan said. 
“In fairness to Dorian, I don’t want him 
to feel undue pressure on himself.”

fers Antoinette Bannister and Cassie Peoples will help offset the losses.
With a team only nine play-
ers deep, the potential impact of the incoming transfers is lim-itless. 
“Two really, really dynamic 
pieces for the puzzle for us,” coach Amanda Butler said of Peoples and Bannister. 
“Both of those young la-
dies have high basketball IQs. 
They’re both scorers and play-
makers in very different ways. They understand the game on both ends of the ﬂ  oor. They both ﬁ  t in the way we like to play in being very aggressive.”
Peoples has been plagued 
with injuries for much of her college career. 
She was limited to six games 
in her only season at Texas be-fore receiving a medical red-shirt after having an intramed-ullary rod placed in her left leg.
Peoples chose to transfer to 
Florida after her injury and the resignation of then-Texas coach Gail Goestenkors. 
Last season at Florida, she 
sat out due to transfer rules but 
suffered a  torn labrum in Janu-
ary. 
Finally healthy, Peoples 
credits her conditioning regi-men for getting her into top form. 
“ T y l e r 
Stewart, our condition-
ing coach, 
deﬁ  nitely got 
us in really good shape this sum-mer,” she said. “We 
worked really hard to become that team. It’ll show, once sea-
son comes, the work that we 
put in this summer.”   
Bannister, a Jacksonville na-
tive, is a shooting threat. 
However, she hopes to be-
come more versatile in her ﬁ  rst season with the Gators.
“I feel like I’m going to 
bring a lot of shooting to the 
team,” Bannister said. “From 
high school and AAU, I feel like that’s all people remem-ber. ‘That Bannister girl, she’s a shooter.’ 
“I feel like I have a lot more to bring to the table. I’m just ex-cited about ﬁ  nally being able to show it because I wasn’t really able to show it my freshman year. 
“When they do scouting re-
ports, I want them to say, ‘She’s a strong attacker,’ and, ‘How 
are we going to guard her?’”
Butler will attempt to em-
ploy a new, ﬂ  uid offense this 
season to maximize the skill set of players like Bannister and Peoples. 
 Florida is built for speed, 
and a strong emphasis on the transition game is a focal point 
in the team’s revamped of-
fense. 
“We want to give them a 
little bit more freedom to make decisions and make plays and a little less structure,” Butler said. “We’re trying to maximize their abilities within a place on the ﬂ  oor instead of saying, ‘Go 
here. Screen here. Roll here. 
Dribble here,’ and giving them so many speciﬁ  c directives.”
Butler has said in the past 
that a primary strength of her team is its versatility and play-er interchangeability, but there may be a few kinks to work out at ﬁ  rst. 
“You’re going to see a lot of 
excitement on offense that at the beginning of the year may look a little chaotic,” she said. “But hopefully, it will make sense to us.”
Incoming transfers to play big role

Elizabeth Beisel was named the 
Southeastern Conference Female 
Swimmer of the Week, the league an-nounced Tuesday.
Beisel’s award came after she 
won three individual events against California on Saturday and Sunday, including beating four-time Olympic gold medalist Missy Franklin in the 500-yard freestyle.
Florida’s women dropped the 
meet to Cal, losing multiple races by just fractions of a second.
“When we talk about compet-
ing, we tell our athletes, ‘You have to put yourself in position to do well in those races,’” assistant coach An-thony Nesty said.
While the women’s team suffered 
its ﬁ  rst loss of the season, the Florida men’s team has looked dominant. 
Currently 2-0 (1-0 SEC) in dual 
meets this fall, the men’s team is 
on the radar to win a national title 
thanks to strong performances from upperclassmen.
“I think the way the season pro-
gressed, if you look at (redshirt se-nior) Sebastien Rousseau’s perfor-mance throughout the season, he’s been on point all semester,” Nesty said. 
Nesty credited Rousseau’s work ethic in practice and during the off-season, saying Rousseau is “the key to the success of the men so far.”
Nesty also praised Marcin Cie-
slak’s effort this year. 
The senior has posted three top 
NCAA times this season in the 100- (47.36 seconds) and 200-yard butter-ﬂ  y (1:45.03), as well as the 200-yard individual medley (1:46).
As a team, Florida’s men own sev-
en of the 22 event-best times this year, including junior Dan Wallace’s 500-yard free (4:23.09), the 200- (1:20.23) and 800-yard free relay (6:32.82), as 
well as the 400-yard medley relay 
(3:13.30), to go with Cieslak’s three event bests.
The UF men lead the NCAA in 
top times. Second is Michigan, which won the national title a season ago, with four. 
The women’s team also has na-
tional-best times this season. Bei-
sel owns top marks in the 500-yard 
free (4:45.09) and the 400-yard IM (4:09.54). Sophomore Natalie Hinds has the 100-yard ﬂ  y (53.91 seconds), and UF’s 800-yard free relay (7:19.27) is almost three seconds ahead of sec-ond-best Georgia’s time.
Florida’s next meet will bring the 
defending women’s SEC and NCAA 
champion Georgia to Gainesville in 
a dual meet featuring both its men’s and women’s teams on Nov. 1.Beisel honored despite loss SWIMMING
