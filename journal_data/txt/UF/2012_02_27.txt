  For four nights in a row, Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity 
members smacked ﬁ  ve recruits with paddles. Each time, 
the beatings lasted at least an hour.
  University Police ﬁ  led sworn complaints to the State 
Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce on Thursday alleging that nine UF stu-dents and one alumnus engaged in hazing with a risk of 
physical injury or death.
  The report, which was released Friday, names the fol-
lowing APA members: Metkel W. Beiene, Chad W. Bil-lington II, Brandon T. Daniel, Gregory J. Davis, Jason A. Dubery, Christopher D. Jenkins, Dominique E. Martin, 
Bryan E. Mizzell and Gary B. Terrell. Safo O. Agyemang, 
who graduated in 2007, also beat recruits, according to 
police.
  None of the suspects is allowed 
to step foot on campus right now, ac-cording to a UF release. The university 
also ﬁ  red Agyemang and Billington, 
who were temporary employees, said 
spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
  “We are extremely disappointed 
with the alleged conduct of the 10 in-dividuals charged with hazing,” said 
Dave Kratzer, UF’s interim vice president of student af-fairs. “We will not tolerate hazing or any behavior that threatens the health and safety of our students.”
  While Sikes would not comment on any of the stu-
dents in this case, she said UF usually suspends those who are suspects in “violent, serious incidents.”
  The hazing included forced chores, slaps to the chest 
and paddle beatings, according to police. Scabs covered one recruit’s bottom. Green bruises spotted another 
man’s collarbone. A third recruit said he couldn’t sleep 
on his back for several nights.

  The UF Supreme Court deter-
mined that three upcoming Students 
Party engineering senators will be al-lowed to keep their seats.
  The court met Sunday night to hear 
the Election Commission’s recom-mendation to disqualify the Students Party engineering candidates. The justices ruled there was not enough evidence to prove the Students Party violated codes, so disqualiﬁ  cation was no longer an issue.
  “The mixed ﬁ  nding of fact and 
law was not supported by substantial evidence,” said acting Chief Justice Cecily Welsh after the hearing.  A candidate for the Students Party 
contacted a student organization to get information about its meeting. The organization had already met, but the president offered to send in-formation through its list-serv. The political advertisement ended up being sent through an academic list-serv, which violates election codes.
  Michael Hacker, the Election 
Commission chairman, said the party should have foreseen that the organi- Engineering senators to keep seats

  Parking decal prices could go up 
by 4 percent starting in May if a re-
quest from UF’s Transportation and Parking Services is approved.
  The price increase would change 
the cost of an annual decal for any student vehicle from $144 to $150.
  This price change is not unusual, 
said Director Scott Fox. He said it is the smallest percentage increase re-quested in about 12 years.
  Fox said Transportation and 
Parking Services receives no operat-ing money from the state or univer-sity , so it covers its expenses with revenue.
  The greatest expenses for next 
year will include about $3.5 million in payments on four parking ga-rages, about $1 million in upkeep of the garages and $725,000 in lighting 
utilities, according to information 
Fox provided.  “We can’t turn off the lights in 
the parking garages at night because we’ve run out of money,” Fox said.
  The proposed changes will be 
presented to UF’s Board of Trustees at its March meeting. Fox expects the changes to be approved.
  The price change would become 
effective for the decal year starting May 1. Faculty and staff decals are renewed then, Fox said, but the stu-dent decal year starts in the fall.
  Students buying decals during 
the summer will pay the old price.
  Accounting junior Sara Rodri-
guez, 19, said decals are already pricey enough. Still, she’ll probably buy one for next year.
  “My car’s up here,” she said.

Hot tub installation on campus 
roof a mystery
ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Offi-
cials are puzzled over a mysteri-
ous hot tub that was installed — and then removed — from the roof of a building on the University of 
Michigan campus in Ann Arbor.
But a group of “creative” stu-
dents are believed to be the cul-
prits, spokesman Steven Crang told AnnArbor.com on Friday.
Initially reported by the Michi-
gan Daily campus newspaper, the hot tub was first noticed Saturday , had visitors and was gone by Mon-
day night.
“People were kind of flabber -
gasted,” Crang said. “It was ob-
viously unexpected. It was pretty creative and now it’s gone. It left a buzz in its wake.”
Despite its short stay , students 
called the hot tub the Bob and Betty Beyster Bubbler after the 
couple who donated $15 million to 
the school. The building is named after them.
The philanthropic couple 
“found it amusing,” Crang said.
“It’s apparently people who are 
close to the department because they were able to gain access to the building and install the tub,” he 
said of whoever installed it. “The 
thing that intrigued everyone was that it was on the fourth floor bal-cony. It’s a large hot tub and the doors that lead out to the balcony are not real big, so they had to do some work to get it out there.”

UF students might have said “mischief managed” 
when the last Harry Potter movie came out in the sum-
mer of 2011, but they won’t have to say goodbye to au-thor J.K. Rowling just yet.
She announced Friday via Twitter that her new novel 
for adults will be published later this year.  
Rowling wrote the seven Harry Potter books, which 
were released in the U.S. from 1998 to 2007. The books have been translated into 69 languages and have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide, according to Rowling’s page on the Scholastic publishing website.
Her new novel, however, will be aimed at adults in-
stead of children.
“It would only make sense for her to write an adult 
book, seeing as all her readers that grew up reading the books have just done that: grown up,” said 21-year-old interior design major Mayling Sigler.
The book deal is estimated to be worth about $8 mil-
lion, according to the UK Daily Mail website.
Telecommunication major Andrew Arons, 19, said he 
wishes Rowling were writing a Potter prequel.
Details about the novel will be an-
nounced later in the year, according to Rowling’s website.
“I’m honestly surprised it took her 
this long to make something new,” said 20-year-old religious studies major Ste-phen Smith. He said he looks forward to seeing Rowling’s potential outside 
of Harry Potter.
“Of course I’m going to read it,” Smith said. “Frank-
ly, I’d read her grocery lists.”J.K. Rowling to release adult-oriented book

� ENTRANTS HAD 48 HOURS 
TO MAKE AND SUBMIT FILMS.

Not many people would subject 
themselves to 48 hours of nail-biting 
tension and a crushing deadline for fun, but Santa Fe College digital me-dia professor Marc Shahboz was not 
looking for average people. He was 
looking for people who eat, sleep and breathe film.
The deadline for SFC’s second an-
nual 48 Hour Film Competition was 7 p.m. sharp Sunday night at Emilia-no’s Cafe — a deadline so strict that two teams were disqualified for sub-mitting three minutes late.
“It’s a great learning experience,” 
Shahboz said. “It teaches you how to deal with deadlines and work to-gether as a team.”
The 23 teams were given a fixed 
genre, a line and an object to incor -
porate into their movie. This year, teams were tasked to make a heist film featuring a candlestick and the line, “I got a bone to pick with you.”
Hollywood producer Del Weston, 
senior producer of Ubisoft video games Marc Fortier and Humoring the Fates’ Jesse Norton will judge the films.The winning teams will be an-
nounced and will receive their awards March 14 after a screening of all the films at 7 p.m. in the building E theater at Santa Fe.
During the filming and amid the 
mayhem and stress, one team got the attention of the authorities — twice.
Nick May and his team were cho-
reographing a fight on the second floor of the parking garage on Gale Lemerand Drive. It was four guys fighting three, and the scene was so intense it persuaded an uninformed bystander to call University Police.

tor.org.Filmmakers brave deadlines in contestmeeting for interested members on Jan. 22. In the days after, the 
five recruits were ordered to recite information in unison at the fraternity house, located at 630 NW 36th St.
When the recruits made a mistake, members greeted them 
with “thunderslaps” — three or four smacks on the chest. UPD received a photo of one victim after receiving the abuse. Bright red marks in the shape of overlapping hands covered both sides of the recruits’ chest.
About a week after the initial meeting, members told re-
cruits to spell a nine-letter acronym. With each letter, the mem-bers spanked the recruits with a paddle. The recruits were told 
this was a “birth right,” according to police.
For the next three nights, the recruits came to the APA 
house and answered questions about the fraternity. If the re-cruits didn’t answer correctly and at the same time, members 
hit them with paddles. At the end of each night, members spanked recruits six to nine times. 
In all, the paddling sessions lasted between one and two 
hours each night, according to police.
When an Alligator reporter knocked on the front door of the 
APA house Friday, nobody answered.
UPD began its investigation when it received a complaint 
on Feb. 4, and on Feb. 7 the APA national organization ordered 
the UF chapter to stop all activities until further notice. 
Sikes said the university’s Anti-Hazing Task Force will meet 
Monday at 2 p.m.
“Disciplinary procedures will come as appropriate,” she 
said.

Emma Roulette brought Abra-
ham Lincoln and George Washing-
ton to life on the walls of Chester Shell Elementary School on Satur -
day.
She dipped the tip of her paint-
brush in brown paint and carefully shaped Lincoln’s eyes, which will look out at elementary school stu-dents for years to come.
The 17-year-old biology freshman 
was one of about 1,200 volunteers who spruced up the school Friday through Sunday as a part of Project 
Makeover. Roulette contributed to 
the educational mural to help beau-tify the school, which is located in a low-income area of Hawthorne.
Project Makeover, an organiza-
tion inspired by ABC’s popular show, “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,” fixed up Chester Shell El-ementary School this year with a se-
ries of murals, a vegetable garden, a 
new science lab and a quarter-mile fitness trail.
The project was funded with 
$10,000 the organization raised in the last year through fundraisers and donations from businesses, said Megan Iseman, Project Makeover executive director.
She said the school was one of 
four schools considered for a make-over because a majority of the stu-dents are eligible for free or reduced-cost lunch.
One goal of the project was to 
increase students’ interest in sci-ence. Chester Shell principal Denise Schultz said the school has had some of the district’s worst FCAT science scores in past years.
“It’s kind of always been a dream 
since I came out here to have a sci-ence area that would be exciting and 
stimulating and get kids interested 
in the sciences,” she said.
This weekend, her dream came 
true. The new science lab has bea-kers and test tubes, new lab tables and stools, models of human organs and a full-size skeleton.
Hawthorne Mayor Matthew 
Surrency helped create a vegetable 
garden where students will be able 
to learn about plants in an interac-tive environment. He said he was impressed by the UF students who volunteered.
“It’s humbling to see that people 
would do that for your community ,” Surrency said.Project Makeover volunteers fix up Hawthorne elementary school

Election Commission says Unite Party did not coerce Greek voters
zation could have sent the email through 
an academic listserv instead of an organi-zation listserv.
The election codes state that a political 
party is liable for the individuals and orga-nizations that support it. If there is clear evi-dence that the party asked the organization to violate election codes, the Election Com-mission can hold the party responsible.
Jonathan Ossip, representing the Stu-
dents Party, said the email was sent, but the party did not ask for it to be sent through a listserv.  
“The clear intent was lawful,” Ossip 
said.  “We did not solicit the unlawful ac-tion.”
The court ruled that there wasn’t a 
strong enough connection. There wasn’t enough evidence to show that the Students Party could have anticipated the results, Welsh said after the hearing.
Associate Justice Tim Mason said clearer 
limits on what can be foreseen must be set.
Welsh said it will be outlined in the court’s opinion.
The Students Party decided not to appeal 
another decision, in which the Election Commission ruled that the Unite Par -
ty did not coerce Greek voters to vote in Student Government elections.
At Friday’s hearing, 
the Students Party pre-sented an email from 
Beatrice Diehl, a member of Sigma Kappa sorority, as evidence. She wrote that sisters get incentives to put their “I voted” stickers on a board in the sorority house.
However, Diehl was not available for 
questioning.
Hacker said the Students Party did not 
present any evidence that the Unite Party solicited actions from the sorority.
The Students Party decided not to ap-
peal due to the difficulty of collecting evi-dence, Ossip said.
The Student Senate will vote whether to 
pass the election results at Tuesday’s Sen-ate meeting.

Forty-nine contestants opened 
the Strong Gator competition with 
a shout in unison.
“I am the strongest Gator,” they 
yelled into the wind, each con-vinced it was true.
Four hours later, only five vic-
torious contestants, one from each weight division, had earned the right to shout that mantra.
The competition, hosted by Rec-
Sports, took place on Maguire Field on Saturday and tested contestants’ strength, endurance and speed as they fought for bragging rights and 
a Strong Gator champion T-shirt.
Competitors had one shot at 
each of the four events: atlas stone, 
log clean and press, yoke walk and 
the medley.
The contestant with the highest 
combined score for all four events in his or her weight class was 
named the winner.
Five minutes into the event, 
grunting and heavy breathing com-
peted with the blaring music played to pump up competitors.
Strong Gator was a family affair 
for Robin Clark, a 20-year-old com-
puter science junior. He competed against his brother Raymond, a 19-year-old freshman, in the divi-
sion for men between 175 and 204 pounds.
The brothers developed a shared 
workout routine and intensified 
their training last week by practic-
ing with heavier weights, Robin Clark said.
Because of a tie in his weight 
class, Robin had to repeat the med-
ley, an event in which contestants 
complete tasks, such as repeatedly flipping a 500-pound tire.
He lost the tiebreaker, but he said 
he was still happy with his second-
place performance.
“I did the best I could,” he said.
Muna Oli, a 19-year-old psychol-
ogy freshman, entered at the last 
minute when her trainer, Erin Col-
lins, convinced her to participate.
Oli arrived Saturday morning 
with just one thought in her mind.
“I didn’t want to embarrass 
Erin,” she said.
She didn’t. Oli was all smiles af-
ter beating seven opponents to win 
the division for women weighing 
less than 140 pounds.
The toughest part of the com-
petition, she said, was lifting a 
100-pound atlas stone onto a waist-
level platform as many times as she 
could in 45 seconds.
She held out her arms to prove 
her point, exposing bloody scrapes 
on the inside of her wrists from 
rubbing against the stone’s rough 
surface.
“I’m glad I got some war 
wounds,” Oli said.

� ELECTION DAY IS  
TUESDAY.

Alligator Writer
As election day descends 
upon the city , thoughts of last 
year’s runoff loom over the candidates.
Last year, the election for the 
District 2 seat of the Gainesville City Commission found itself in a runoff between two staunchly different candidates. This year is no different, but the stakes are higher.
The victor of this year’s run-
off on Tuesday between Lau-ren Poe and Nathan Skop will 
represent the entire city , rather 
than just one district.
Poe, an incumbent, lost to 
current Commissioner Todd Chase in the April 2011 race, re-ceiving 2,045 votes while Chase won with 2,463 votes.
This time around, Chase 
contributed to Skop’s campaign 
and endorsed him in the cur -
rent election against his former 
opponent.
In regular elections on Jan. 
31, Poe secured 4,402 votes and Skop received 2,944 votes.
Poe, an associate professor 
at Santa Fe College who served on the Gainesville City Com-
mission from 2008 to 2011, said 
he respects Chase’s decision, but it should not hide the fact that Chase and Skop have con-trasting personalities.
“Chase was mellow and 
laid-back when he ran his cam-paign,” Poe said. “Mr. Skop is very intense.”  
It is Skop’s issues-based 
campaign and use of political rhetoric that Poe said make him more of an invasive opponent.
During the Alachua County 
Democratic Black Caucus forum on Jan. 20, Skop continually re-ferred to Poe as his “opponent who was previously voted out of office.” Fifteen minutes into the forum, the moderator told 
Skop he could not longer refer 
to Poe in that manner. Some in the audience applauded.
Despite the difference in op-
ponents, Poe said he’s much more comfortable in this year’s runoff than last year’s. He said he has honed in on current city initiatives, such as the city’s 
biomass contract, Innovation 
Gainesville and adding more outdoor public areas.
Skop, a lawyer, said he is 
proud of running an issues-based campaign that is focused on bringing change to the cur -
rent state of the commission.
Chase said he pledged his 
support to Skop because of his background in the utility in-dustry , which he said will be of great value to the commission.
Skop served four years on 
the Florida Public Service Com-mission where he worked to prevent utility rate increases. He is steadfastly against the 
city’s biomass contract.
He has cited it as a “$3.1 bil-
lion financial disaster of the City 
Commission’s own making” in most public forums throughout the election.
Skop voted in favor of the 
contract while he was on the Public Service Commission. He 
said he didn’t take the rate in-
crease into consideration when voting because his vote re-volved around the city’s energy needs, not rate impacts.
As one who served with Poe 
on the commission from 2008 to 2011, Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa she she supports 
Poe and his positive, progres-
sive campaign. The winner of the runoff will take her seat on the commission in May.
“We didn’t always agree on 
things, but he was always hard-working and thoughtful,” she said.Candidates in runoff

Charlotte Solomon bit into a chocolate-
chip mealworm cookie, ready for the sur -
prise inside.
The Santa Fe College zoo technology 
freshman had just finished a meal of squir -
rel and quail — capping it off with a worm-
filled dessert.
“Dude, you can’t even taste it,” she said, 
chewing.
She paused. Hesitation. A bitter taste 
flooded her mouth.
“There’s the crunch,” she said. “All right, 
who wants my desserts?”
She and about 400 others feasted Satur -
day on stranger-than-usual fare at the UF student chapter of The Wildlife Society’s 
29th annual Beast Feast, the organization’s yearly fundraiser.
Sam Baraoidan, co-vice president of the 
chapter, said hunters and ranchers from across the Southeast donate the meat. Club 
members take the cuts home to simmer and 
bake for the buffet.
A line of people twisted under a wooden 
pavilion. About 20 minutes before the food 
was fair game, there were about 100 people 
in line. Fifteen minutes later, that count had at least doubled.
Volunteers lifted trays from trailer ovens 
holding hundreds of pans. The ovens kept 
squirrel soup, “Bambi tacos” and other dish-
es at a balmy 250 degrees.
Inevitably, Baraoidan will have people 
ask her why a club that aims to protect ani-
mals would host such an event.
She said the majority of wildlife conser -
vation funds come from taxes on guns, am-munition and fishing licences, making the food chain another piece of the protection 
puzzle.
Baraoidan said the event is intensely pop-
ular among the conservation community.
“There’s a huge fan base of people who 
wait all year for this,” she said.
As the dishes were put into place, vol-
unteers peeled off foil, releasing steam and 
smells that resembled beef stew with a hint 
of pepper.
“I’m ready,” said a woman fourth in line, 
grasping her plate and fork. “I’m ready for 
this.”
With 60 foil dishes at the ready — and a flock of volunteers ready to replace the scav-enged fare — a volunteer released the herd.
“Go. Yes. Eat,” she said.
People packed heaps of quail wings, 
veal-a-roni and sheep onto their doubled-up Styrofoam plates.
Nearby, Cowboyz Bar-B-Q and Cater -
ing staff carved hunks of hog. Steam seeped 
from the brown-red meat as the carvers 
worked. The air smelled of brisket.
Even after replacement dishes didn’t 
match with the labels, visitors piled on heaps of the mystery meat. Brave folk dug into 
cups of dirt: the dirt was fake; the worms 
were not.
Solomon said the event lived up to the 
hype.
“It just sounded amazing, like one of 
those things that you have to do before you die,” she said.Organization serves mealworm cookies, ‘Bambi tacos’ at fundraiser“I am the strongest

Today’s question: Do you care about awards shows?
198 TOTAL VOTES57% YES
43% NOFriday’s question: Are you on Twitter? Big Difference
Opinions allowed on 
opinions pages
The events of last week sparked much debate and discus-
sion on campus about the ethics of reporting, the purpose of a campus newspaper and the idea of bias in the me-
dia.
Another point of contention was whether or not the Alliga-
tor should have commented on some of the events within its opinions section.
This prompted a lot of discussion about journalistic integrity 
and the difference between fact and opinion.
From the discussions that occurred last week, it appears 
there is still some confusion about the difference between a news article and an editorial or an opinion column.
In this newspaper, everything on pages six and seven is 
opinion about current events.
Shocking, right? Well, it would be if there was not a giant 
header at the top of the page that reads “Opinions.”
Yes, despite the strive for objectivity in reporting, many 
newspapers include a section where people are allowed to voice their thoughts and comments on the issues of the day.
That section usually features editorials from the editorial 
board of the newspaper. This is a chance for the editors of the paper to give their two cents about the news of the day.
This section also features columns and letters, often distin-
guished from editorials by the sub-heading Op/Ed or “Oppo-site the Editorial Page.”
In the Op/Ed section, columnists have the opportunity to 
bring up issues and topics of interest. Unlike regular news arti-cles, columnists also have a chance to say what they think about those issues, usually citing relevant facts and figures to support their argument.
When they are writing for the opinions section, most colum-
nists do not refer to themselves as reporters; it would be disin-
genuous to do so.
The newspaper has a responsibility to ensure that the colum-
nists are accurate in their reporting of facts and figures, but they 
are generally left alone to comment on the issue at hand. The newspaper also makes sure that the columnists do not discuss anything that could slander the reputation of another.
However, if they are commenting on a news item that re-
ports information, they are well within their right to comment on that fact or figure, as long as they cite where they got their 
information.
So for anyone out there who feels that writers on the opin-
ions pages do not display the proper journalistic etiquette that 
reporters follow, we have one thing to say: Columnists are not reporters.
That is not to say that they are not credible or informative. 
They just have a different role to fill when it comes to bringing you information.
On the same note, editorials, like this one, are not news ar -
ticles. This is simply an opinion.
Take everything you read in the opinions section with a 
grain of salt, and be sure to do your own research before form-ing an opinion.With or without affection, sex is an agreement
Over the past few weeks, two men have individu-
ally caused me to rack up a $20.37 tab at Taco Bell. When that sort of thing happens, I summon 
my army of empowered women to my side.
Dress code: a paint-stained shirt, slippers and a pair 
of I-don’t-need-no-man pregnancy pants. After we’ve convened like Death Eaters to Voldemort, we buy tons 
of junk food and veg out on the couch, all the while per -
forming hoodoo — I mean, bitching about dudes.
Typically, these meetings involve us spending the 
evening validating the poop out of each other’s lives. 
However, during this most recent gathering of my co-
ven of crones — after the obligatory small-talk and 
offering of the sacrificial iguana — one of the women drew my ire.
I’d been ranting to the group about the joys of hav-
ing someone you love suddenly stop talking to you. I’d also been trying to end the ranting so I could eat another Beefy Crunch Burrito.
During one breathing pause, one of the women said, 
“Man, it must suck to get used like that.”
Utterly taken aback, I gasped, taking the opportunity 
to shove another Beefy Crunch Burrito into my mouth.
The girls didn’t seem to understand why I would ob-
ject to saying I got used. But that’s just the thing. People 
don’t get used. They get lied to.
Here, let me explain.
Whenever I hear some girl say she got used, she’s 
typically saying something along the lines of, “All he wanted me for was sex. He didn’t actually care about 
me.” Ugh. Typing that made me want to vomit more 
than Taco Bell ever has.
What the girl’s really saying is that she entered into 
a tacit agreement with a dude that she would give him 
sexy time in exchange for affection or some other form 
of emotional security. The dude didn’t deliver, and now she’s got her pantsuit in a knot over it.The first thing that bothers 
me about this: Sex should not be treated as a commodity. I 
don’t understand the idea that 
a dude shouldn’t boink you without offering something in return. 
It boggles my mind more 
than playing Boggle usually 
does. 
A man owes you nothing for sexy time, and vice ver -
sa, because sex isn’t a barter economy.
Access to your body should not be like buying wa-
termelons at a bazaar. You need to make the decision to touch someone based on whether you want to bump uglies, not on any expected return. If you let someone 
run around your baseball diamond, take responsibility 
for it. Did you not want to fool around with the guy in the first place?
Let me tell you something I learned from the many ex-
cons who’ve taken my order at Taco Bell over the years: 
Always get the payment before you give the food.
If you want affection or some other form of emo-
tional security, ask for it up front. Tell the guy what 
you’re looking for. If he’s unwilling to provide it, you 
shouldn’t expect straddling him to change his mind — 
and if it did, you should find that insulting and drop his fanny anyway.
An unspoken agreement is no agreement at all. You 
need to talk to make sure both of you are seeking the 
same thing. That way, he can only lie to you.
Don’t get me wrong — guys treat everyone like crap 
at one point or another. I’m not seeking to exonerate.
Men suck.Just get mad at them for the right stuff.

Hazing is not tolerated at UF
After a thorough investigation, the University Police De-
partment has forwarded sworn allegations to the State Attor -
ney that nine UF students and one alumnus engaged in very 
serious hazing. Hazing brings severe consequences, both 
through UF’s Student Conduct Code process and the state’s judicial process. Hazing is abhorrent and is not in keeping with the values of UF. Friends do not hurt friends and endan-
ger their physical and emotional well-being.
The UF community believes its students should be able to 
excel in an academic environment that is safe. I encourage all 
UF students, faculty and staff to take a stand against hazing. Join me in applauding the courage of the victims in this par -
ticular situation throughout a difficult investigation. If you notice a sign of distress, help each other and do something.
Signs of distress from hazing or other causes may include: 
bruises, physical discomfort, unexplained injuries, excessive 
tiredness, physical exhaustion, significant change in behavior 
or healthy habits, irritability, use of alcohol or other drugs and risky behavior.
In the fall, UF launched an initiative called U Matter, We 
Care that urges faculty, staff, students and their families to 
take notice of signs of distress and to get the person in dis-
tress to one of UF’s many helping resources.
The U Matter team is available at umatter@ufl.edu or 352-
392-CARE. If you notice one of the signs above, please con-
tact one of the helping resources found at www.umatter.ufl.
edu/resource.php or contact the U Matter team directly.
For many years, UF has provided a wide variety of pro-
gramming and training for its student groups and others regarding the dangers of hazing and directions for provid-
ing positive bonding and team-building experiences. Despite 
this longstanding, concerted effort and a university-wide anti-hazing task force just beginning its work, criminal com-plaints have been filed against individuals for serious physi-
cal hazing.
Please reflect on what being a Gator means. Step up and 
help us eliminate any destructive activity in our community. 
Reach out to those who need assistance. Together, we can decisively address the actions of a few that fundamentally 
conflict with our culture for care that so many students ex-
perience.

Still room for improvement in voter turnout
After nearly a month of Unite and Students Party cam-
paign staff occupying Turlington, we’ve finally come to the end of the election season. Innumerable fliers were passed 
out, dozens of platform points were discussed and thousands 
of votes were cast — 10,644 to be exact, the highest total ever for a nonrunoff Student Government election.
While some may attribute the increase in voter turnout to 
dogs in T-shirts or hilarious cat videos, we believe something else was at play. Until this year, many students saw SG as an elitist organization controlled by a highly mobilized minority where only a select few had the connections to get involved.
Last week, we uprooted that myth and proved to the aver -
age student that SG really is accessible, but only if you make your voice heard. Whether freshman or grad student, Greek or non-Greek, part of an organization or unaffiliated, we all have a responsibility to vote. 
This same responsibility follows us after college into our 
homes and communities as we elect everyone from city com-missioners to the president of the United States. Why, then, would we shirk the privilege of voting while here at UF? Al-though 10,644 students participating is a step in the right di-
rection, there are nearly 40,000 students who chose to abstain 
from voting this year. If nothing else, this proves that we still have a lot of work to do.
So for one last time, we urge you to come out and vote in 
the next Student Government election. It’s your responsibil-ity, your privilege and your voice. Choose to be heard.

After the release of President Obama’s budget a few weeks ago, I was struck at the mas-siveness of federal spending. 
Total federal revenues are close to $3 trillion. However, the death tax, which is the tax most 
targeted at the “1 percent,” brings in about 1 per -
cent of total federal revenue. 
It is high time that this triple tax be eliminated 
from our giant tax code.
The estate tax was started in 1916 in an effort to 
get the wealthy to pay more for the expansion of the military before World War I. 
By 1940, revenues from the tax accounted for 
about 5 percent of all federal revenue. 
Since then, the tax code has exploded with loop-
holes and clever tricks, along with high-powered 
lawyers that make the estate tax look like a joke 
— except for the massive legal bills and lost invest-ment it causes.
I am amused when progressives say that many 
of the wealthy members of our society only pay a 
15-percent tax rate. 
The capital gains tax is applied on the earnings 
from securities that have already been taxed at the 
corporate income tax rate that goes up to 35 per -
cent. 
In a worst-case scenario, $1 of corporate earnings 
passed through to the owner and taxed twice is only $0.5525 — a number that is far from the 15 percent tax rate that the Occupy folks assert.
Even for famous tax-dodgers like General Elec-
tric, the corporate tax rate is not 0 percent forever.
 They do, in fact, pay corporate income taxes. Even low corporate income tax levels result in a 
much higher tax rate for the capitalist class.
With this understanding of taxes, it seems gross-
ly unfair to tax people who are successful and want to pass on the value of their life’s work to their off-spring when they die. 
The death tax is a triple tax, hitting money that’s 
already been hit twice.
The most dangerous effect of the death tax, 
though, is what it does to decisions about invest-
ments that create far more jobs on a permanent ba-
sis than the stimulus did temporarily.
The current exemption is $5 million. Imagine 
you are a car dealership owner with a worth of $10 million. 
You have a choice.Would you purchase 
another dealership, which would likely increase your net-worth by $5 million over the course of the next 
10 years?
You know the govern-
ment will take 35 percent of it from your heirs when 
you die.
Does it start to change your mind about taking 
this enormous risk with your personal assets? 
I once spoke with an executive of a large wealth-
management firm who told me a story about how the ultra-rich very rarely pay the full 35 percent on 
their estates. 
They hire six- and seven-figure lawyers who 
make sure they don’t pay. 
Instead, it is the merely wealthy — those who are 
more concerned about the health of their concrete business — who are impacted by the estate tax the 
most.
It is the merely wealthy — those who are more 
concerned with the yield of their strawberry crop —  
who are impacted by the estate tax the most. 
These people don’t have the incentive or inclina-
tion to hire expensive lawyers.
And it is their children who pay for it dearly 
when they die.
Why should you be concerned? 
It is estimated that baby boomers (our parents) 
will inherit $8.4 trillion from our grandparents over the next few decades.
Much of that will be passed on to the boomers’ 
offspring (us). 
If you want to take over the family business one 
day, you might be out of luck if you owe $1.75 mil-lion in taxes from inheriting that car dealership 
posed in the earlier example. 
It is time for this inefficient and distorting tax to 
be eliminated.
It does little to accomplish the redistributive ef-
fect its liberal proponents wish it could.

The walls of Weaver Hall are 
bare before the students 
move in. Cold and white 
concrete canvases. It’s up to them 
to make those lifeless spaces sing; some, like international exchange 
student Aidan Knowles, can trans-
form a sullen spot into a life-sized 
scrapbook.
Knowles is one of about 200 in-
ternational exchange students who 
study at UF every year, according 
to the UF International Center. He is a junior from Ireland, and he’s spending his spring semester at UF. Despite the different environment, adjusting has been surprisingly easy for the Dublin native.
“Everything is just so impres-
sive,” he said. “I’m just ... I’m just 
really proud to be here.”
Knowles has gotten so used to 
campus life at a public university 
that he doesn’t even want to think about leaving. When May rolls around, Knowles will head home to a city where clouds hover over tiny streets, and concepts he loves, like collegiate pride and spirit, don’t ex-
ist.
“I saw a woman the other day 
wearing a shirt that said ‘Gator 
nurse since 1973,’ and I just couldn’t stop thinking about it,” he said. “We don’t even make shirts with our school’s name on them because no-body would buy them. No one cares where they graduate from.”
Knowles is in his early 20s and 
looks more Spanish than Irish. He has silky black hair that swoops over his forehead, black scruff and brown eyes that glaze when he has too many beers. The only Irish thing about his appearance, he said, is his pale skin, but that will change now that the weather is warming up.
“It’s always f***ing raining 
there,” he said. “It makes you want to stay inside. Everyone is so active here because of the nice weather.”
As a journalism student at the 
Dublin Institute of Technology , a well-known college in Ireland that 20,000 students attend, Knowles had the opportunity to study journalism at UF or the University of Missouri through an exchange program. He chose UF because of the warm weather.
He said one of the main differ -
ences he’s noticed between here and 
his home is that grade point averag-
es are a myth at his school in Dublin. All students have to do is pass their classes during senior year and they get their degree.
His school is in downtown Dub-
lin, but Knowles lives a 30-minute bus ride outside of the city in a suburb with his mom, dad and 14-
year-old sister. Weaver Hall, UF’s 
international residence hall and his home here in Gator country, is only a 5-minute walk from his classes.
Unlike UF, in Dublin, the col-
lege’s campus is spread out around the city . School buildings are plopped among the pubs and the bookie agencies that line the narrow streets.
But, he said, despite Dublin’s 
propensity for long-distance travel, there’s a road in Gainesville that ri-
vals the biggest highway in Ireland.
He said crossing Archer Road is 
like crossing Ireland’s busiest “mo-
torway.”
“Everytime I cross it, I’m always 
like ‘I’m gonna die. Oh my God, Oh my God, I’m gonna die,’” he said.
The fact that UF has an actual, 
walkable campus in one area of a 
city is mesmerizing to him.
The compact campus is what 
adds to the strong sense of school 
pride, he said, because students are constantly reminded that they are all Gators.
Even the idea of dining halls 
where students can gather to eat was foreign to him until he came 
here. At home, he said, students dis-
perse throughout the city and eat at cafes, rarely realizing that the person next to them may also go to the same school.
Every day , he looks forward 
to eating omelettes and drinking smoothies while dissecting the pre-vious night’s antics and sharing stories with friends at Gator Corner 
Dining Center. Knowles and his 
Weaver Hall friends spend hours getting to know one another while half-eaten plates around them turn into 6-inch stacks.
“We are all in the same boat com-
ing here,” he said. “None of us know anyone, so we just all got along right off the bat.”
JR Miller, his resident hall ad-
viser, said there is a rumor going around Weaver Hall that Knowles is most likely to be crowned prom king at the international students’ prom in April. At the end of every semester, the international students’ residence hall holds a dance for all of the tenants. They call it prom.
“He’s always wants to go places 
and try things,” Miller said. “I think that’s why he settled in so easily . He just wants to be around everybody.”
Knowles and his friends visit the 
UF Bookstore at least every week to add to their growing Gator cloth-
ing collection. He said he admires 
school spirit so much that last week he spent $100 on Gators T-shirts, in-cluding a women’s water polo shirt that he got for a tournament.
Sporting events keep school spir -
it alive, Knowles said, adding that the absence of collegiate athletics in Dublin is probably the reason for 
students’ apathy toward their col-
leges. The Dublin Institute of Tech-nology has no school-wide sporting events. His school doesn’t have a sta-dium, let alone a stadium that seats 90,000 people. He laughed when he thought about Ben Hill Griffin Sta-dium sitting in the middle of a city whose tallest building is four stories 
and whose streets are about as wide 
as the end zone.
“You guys are so lucky ,” he said. 
“I wish I was here for football season, but we get a taste of what it must be like when we’re at basketball games. I’m coming back for one, though. I’ll be back.”
Most international students at UF 
leave with the hope of coming back, said Lyn Straka, director of UF’s International Exchange Visitor Ser -
vices. Those who have a hard time transitioning to life here find the language barrier or the educational 
system difficult.
“Students who understand that 
this is an experience and don’t just 
allow it to happen to them are the ones that get the most out of being here,” Straka said. “ You have to be a part of the environment and the experiences.”
Knowles knows that come May 
he’ll have to tear everything down from his walls, so for now, he plans to continue to cover them in memo-ries.
“By the time I leave, there won’t 
be any white showing,” he said. “I’m not just going to sit around and let this time pass.”8, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2012

Using three photographs, a 55-year-old 
video clip and $700 from the Benton Engineer -
ing Council, the UF Gator Robotics club resur -
rected a 7-foot robot from the past.
Michael Andrews, president of the Benton 
Engineering Council, asked Gator Robotics last 
month to rebuild a robot named Otto, which was built by a UF electrical engineer in 1957.
The robot is the mascot for Engineering 
Week, which ends today. Otto will be on dis-play at the State of the College Address at 5:30 p.m. in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
The seven-student design team completed 
the basic construction of the robot Wednesday, said Camilo Buscaron, president of Gator Ro-botics.
“I’m really proud of the work they did,” he 
said.
The robot can move its eyes, mouth and 
arms, 18-year-old material science and en-gineering freshman Kevin French said. The 
team plans to add a speaker so Otto can talk 
and to give Otto the ability to shake hands and wave.
“We have been brainstorming all kinds of 
things to add to him. Everything from a jet pack to tank treads,” French said. “Maybe a team in the future will make a female Otto, and it’ll be like the new Albert and Alberta.”Robotics club recreates 1950s

A new UF blog about the Reitz 
Union is set to debut in early March 
and is still looking for student blog-gers.
The Reitz Union is accepting blog-
ger applications until Wednesday. Students picked to write for the blog, which has the working title of Union Life blogs, will have a profile on the Reitz Union’s website and will each post about once a month.
The blog comes shortly after the 
January premiere of UF’s history de-partment’s blog, which was created to 
showcase students’ accomplishments, 
trips and other aspects of the depart-ment.
The Reitz Union blogs should go 
live within the next few weeks, said Emily Davis, marketing coordinator at the Reitz Union.
Students can either write for the Re-itz Union blog as volunteers, or they can receive unpaid internship credit, she said.
The history department’s official 
blog, History@UF, is written solely by volunteers. Its first full entry was post-ed on Jan. 31.
Sean Adams, an associate professor 
in the history depart-
ment, said blogs like 
this help enhance the 
university’s sense of community.
Both blogs focus

Rainey at the NFL Combine
Former Gators running back Chris Rainey posted a 4.45 time 
in the 40-yard dash Sunday at the NFL Combine. The time tied two others for the second-fastest for a running back. Tennis match rained out
Florida’s women’s tennis match Sunday against North Carolina was cancelled before singles play could begin due to rain. It will not be rescheduled. Florida coach Mike Holloway said the women’s track team’s win at last weekend’s SEC Indoor Championships was a result of an offseason approach to improve.  See story, page 16.
� UF BEAT WILLIAM & MARY 
5-3 ON SUNDAY. 
  BRYAN HOLT
 Alligator Writer
 Kevin O’Sullivan and Frank Le-
oni walked toward one another and 
shook hands, ofﬁ  cially concluding a 
day of tarp slip-and-slides, fake deer 
hunting and just more than ﬁ  ve in-nings of baseball. 
  The head coaches of Florida (7-1) 
and William & Mary (2-5) called it a day after rain shortened the week-end ﬁ  nale, giving the No. 1 Gators a 5-3 victory and a series sweep. 
  “We did enough,” O’Sullivan 
said. “We weren’t really sharp this 
weekend; we got a lot of things we 
got to work on.”
  For Florida, a nearly hour-long 
rain delay was a ﬁ  tting end to a strange game. 
  After ﬁ  rst pitch was moved from 
1 p.m. to 12:35 p.m., starting right-handed pitcher Karsten Whitson 
took the mound and immediately 
looked uncomfortable. He lasted just 13 pitches, getting an early mound visit and then being pulled two bat-ters later after an RBI single by Tribe 
ﬁ  rst baseman Michael Katz. 
  Whitson’s fastball velocity was 
down to the high 80s from his usual  Gators clinch series in rain-shortened win
 David Carr / Alligator
S  hortshop Nolan Fontana makes the most of a rain delay Sunday by pretending to be a 
deer. Teammates in a center-ﬁ  eld TV tower bagged the 10-point buck before the game was called in the sixth inning with the Gators leading 5-3. UF swept the three-game series.     
  People jumped to a lot of conclu-
sions after Saturday’s loss, but there’s only one thing that was 
proven beyond doubt. 
  Brad Beal is one of the three best play-
ers in the Southeastern Conference, and one of the top 15 or 20 in all of college 
basketball.
  Concerns that Florida doesn’t have 
enough heart will be addressed in bigger 
games, and it remains to be seen if the Gators can play without Will Yeguete.
Beal, on the other hand, has nothing 
left to prove. 
  He’s improved in every game in a 
Florida uniform, surpassing the high 
expectations that accompanied him as 
one of the best 
recruits Billy Donovan has ever brought to 
Florida.  
  Fans were 
promised the 
next Ray Allen. 
They got the next 
Dwyane Wade. 
  Wade, a 6-foot-4 guard who was list-
ed at 210 pounds at Marquette, averaged 17.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.1 blocks 
on 48.7-percent shooting with an almost 
even assist-to-turnover ratio as a fresh-man. 
  Beal, listed at 6-foot-3 and 207 pounds 
but growing by the week, is averaging 16.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and .9 blocks on 45.7-percent shooting with an almost even assist-to-turnover ratio over the last nine games. 
  He looks like the explosive slashing 
guard who can get to the free-throw line any time he wants, earning 6.7 trips to the charity stripe per game in UF’s last 
nine contests. And, oh by the way, he’s 
converted 85 percent of those tries. 
  He’s been a defensive stud all year, 
and on Saturday he did an outstanding job guarding Kentavious Caldwell-Pope 
and 6-foot-8, 220-pound power forward 
Nemanja Djurisic, an obvious size mis-match. Georgia shot 52.9 percent, but  Beal’s strong 
performance 
overshadows 
UF’s struggles

 On a weekend when the Southeast-
ern Conference crowned Kentucky as its regular season champion, Billy Dono-
van wondered aloud in a back hallway 
of Georgia’s Stegeman Coliseum if his team noticed it still had something to play for.
  The Gators had just played unin-
spired in a 76-62 loss Saturday to the Bulldogs, and with two games left to play before traveling to New Orleans for the SEC tournament, Donovan could 
only describe the ﬂ  at, 40 minutes of bas-ketball he witnessed in Athens, Ga., as 
“puzzling.”
  “I really am concerned if we will ever 
play with any passion again,” Donovan 
said. “I’m being totally honest. Because if you can’t get excited to play on the road against a 
bordering state, get-
ting a chance to go 11-3 in the league, and you come out and play like 
that?”
  Though Florida was playing its ﬁ  rst 
game since losing sophomore Will Yeg-
uete for the season last Tuesday against Auburn, Donovan, as well as his play-ers, didn’t want to use injuries and tired legs as a reason for the loss.
  The Gators were given Wednesday 
off following the home win and returned to practice Thursday and Friday with a main focus of implementing new offen-sive and defensive sets to prepare for life 
without Yeguete. 
  “We can’t use physical (stuff) as an 
excuse because we had a light practice, 
we had days off and we really had a 
mental practice, basically,” freshman 
Brad Beal said. “We really just have to ﬁ  gure something out. I don’t know UF  dumbfounded by lack of energy at GeorgiaEND OF GREGULATION

 Alligator Staff Writer
 Florida had one ﬁ  nal chance 
to boost its NCAA Tournament 
resume against No. 10 Tennessee on Sunday.
  However, the task of defeating 
the Volunteers in perhaps the ﬁ  -nal home game of coach Pat Sum-mitt’s career proved too much for the Gators to overcome.
  Tennessee (21-8, 12-4 South-
eastern Conference) pulled away late in a 75-59 win against Flori-da (18-11, 8-8 SEC) in Knoxville, Tenn., dropping the Gators’ re-
cord against ranked opponents to 
2-7 this season.
  Despite falling to the Vol-
unteers, coach Amanda Butler maintains that her squad is still worthy of an at-large bid to The Big Dance.
  “Our NCAA Tournament 
chances are great,” Butler said. 
“The body of work, in February 
in particular, has been outstand-ing and in terms of proving that we deserve to be in that ﬁ  eld as an at-large bid, is what we need.”
  Florida went into Sunday’s 
game ranked 35th in RPI and 14th in strength of schedule.
  Despite a missed opportunity 
to record a crucial quality win, senior Jordan Jones still believes the Gators will end up on the right side of the bubble come Se-lection Sunday.
  “[Our chances] are not any dif-
ferent than they were last week,” Jones said. “We got beat by a great team on their home court, but that doesn’t put us out. We still have the SEC Tournament.”
  Playing a signiﬁ  cant number 
of close games has worked in 
Florida’s favor throughout the 
year.
  The Gators are 3-9 in games 
decided by six points or fewer this season and Sunday’s contest seemed headed for another tight ﬁ  nish.
  Florida trailed just 55-48 with 
7:19 to play before Tennessee went on a 9-3 run to open up a double-digit lead.
  UF had trouble keeping up 
with UT due to poor shooting from 3-point range. Jones and Lily Svete, who led Florida with 12 points, combined for a 5-of-11 effort from beyond the arc.  But the other eight players to 
receive time against the Volun-teers were 0 of 13 from 3-point range, including a combined 0-of-9 clip from Andrea Vilaró 
Aragonés and Deana Allen.
  “That’s something where 
we’ve got to grow up and ma-
ture,” Jones said. “When threes aren’t falling, we can’t contin-ue to just jack them up the ﬁ  rst chance we get.”
  Inside the arc, Jennifer George 
went up against Glory Johnson in a battle between the top two re-bounders in the SEC.
  Despite recording her SEC-
leading 14th double-double of the season with 11 points and 11 boards, George was not up to Johnson’s level. Johnson scored a game-high 21 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, creating problems for the Florida frontcourt defen-sively.
  George and Azania Stewart 
ﬁ  nished the game with four fouls each.
  “She’s hard to guard one-on-
one,” Butler said. “The way she positions, it’s really hard to get around her and she gets a lot of looks and she gets a lot of things that go her way.”
  With Sunday’s loss to the Vol-
unteers, the Gators ﬁ  nish the reg-ular season ranked eighth in the SEC. Florida will face ninth-place Auburn in the ﬁ  rst round of the SEC Tournament on Thursday at 1 p.m.
  The Gators defeated the Tigers 
70-56 on Feb. 9 in the O’Connell 
Center in their only meeting this 
season.
  “We’ve just got to get back to 
focusing on us and what we did wrong, particularly our defense,” Jones said. 
“If you don’t show up with 
defense in the SEC Tournament, 
you’ll be going home on the ﬁ  rst 
night.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
 Florida drops season ﬁ  nale, chance for quality win at Tennesseethat can’t be blamed on Beal. Despite Djuri-
sic’s physical edge, Beal grabbed eight de-fensive rebounds, maintained good post position and forced Djurisic into tough shots. Florida’s freshman guard was also 
effective fronting the post, even tipping 
an entry pass to force a turnover midway through the first half. If anything, he allevi-ated concerns about Will Yeguete’s absence by proving he can hold his own defensively 
and on the glass against bigger, stronger 
players. The other big question facing the Gators 
after Saturday’s game is heart, but Beal doesn’t have to worry about that, either.
He’s given 100 percent every possession 
on both ends, and is the only player who can’t be lumped in with Donovan’s con-cerns about maturity. His basketball IQ has been praised from day one, and for good 
reason. 
What truly sets him apart is how well 
he does the little things. He knows when to 
switch on defense, who needs to get the ball 
on offense and where he needs to be posi-
tioned on the floor at any given moment. 
Beal’s only weakness has been 32.4 per -
cent 3-point shooting. But with a stroke as pure as his — one that’s Ray Allen-esque — 
it’s only a matter of time and reps before he 
gets it figured out. 
If he chooses to pass up a shot at being 
an NBA lottery pick and come back for an-
other season at Florida, he’ll easily be in the 
running for National Player of the Year. 
And the Gators will be right in the thick 
of the national title race.

was more a case of getting his arm back where it needs to be 
after missing a portion of the 
fall with a groin injury . 
“You can tell he wasn’t feel-
ing his best,” O’Sullivan said. 
“You’ll see that, you’ll see early-
season stuff where the arm just doesn’t bounce back as quick as you want. I’m sure he’s going to be fine.”
After Whitson’s brief out-
ing, UF relievers Steven Rodri-guez and Jonathon Crawford finished the game by throw-
ing a combined five innings of 
three-hit ball. 
Once again, Florida’s of-
fense did just enough to get the win. Junior shortstop Nolan 
Fontana opened the scoring for 
the Gators with a two-run hom-er off the scoreboard in right, and senior right fielder Preston 
Tucker picked up his fifth hom-
er of the season on a blast that went over the scoreboard and across Stadium Road. 
“Obviously there’s still 
things to improve on, as an in-
dividual and as a team,” Tucker 
said.
Freshman left fielder Jus-
tin Shafer also pitched in with a 2-for-2 showing. He singled 
in the third before scoring on 
Fontana’s home run and then doubled in Austin Maddox and Cody Dent one inning later. 
“I’m finally feeling comfort-
able at the plate,” Shafer said. “Being in this kind of atmo-sphere is something to get used to from being in high school.”
With two outs and a 2-0 
count on Tribe shortstop Josh Mason in the top of the sixth, 
the heavy rain became too 
much for home plate umpire Cory Gottsegen and the game was put into a weather delay.
Before the delay was over, 
players from both teams took full advantage of an opportu-nity to let loose. First, messages written on baseballs tossed 
back and forth between dug-
outs led to UF backup catcher Brandon Sedell stripping down to compression shorts and join-
ing a William & Mary coach in 
a slip-and-slide duel. 
Then, after two Tribe play-
ers danced around with 
b a s e b a l l 
pants over 
their heads and arms, 
three Gators 
used the center-field camera tow-
er as a makeshift tree stand and 
“hunted” Fontana and fresh-
man reliever Aaron Rhodes, who crawled around like deer. 
“My heart, I’m dead,” Fon-
tana said, joking about where he had been shot. “There was Zach Powers out there on the sniper stand. We were just hav-ing fun.” 
Florida opened the weekend 
by beating William & Mary 4-1 on Friday night, but the week-end was highlighted by a 5-1 
victory Saturday when Tucker 
broke the UF career RBI record with a home run.   MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida travels to Vanderbilt  
on Tuesday and then closes the  season at home Sunday against top-ranked Kentucky, which 
sealed its SEC regular-season 
title with a win against the Com-modores over the weekend.With a 10-4 conference re-
cord, UF holds a game lead over 9-5 Vanderbilt but will need to win one of its final two games to clinch  the No. 2 seed in the con-ference tournament. Two losses 
could mean the Gators sliding all 
the way to the No. 4 seed, though they would still be eligible for a first-round bye.
“Obviously, I look at myself as 
a coach and say, ‘What can I do to generate energy?’” Donovan said. “Sometimes as a coach with these guys, I feel like I’m grab-
bing these guys by the back of 
their shirts and I’m pulling them up a hill all of the time.”
Florida spent the second half 
against Georgia in a constant 
state of rotation, as Donovan ex-
perimented with UF’s lineups looking for a spark for an inept offense that shot 36.7 percent 
from the field and a lax defense 
which allowed the Bulldogs to shoot 52.9 percent.
Both Erving Walker, the team’s 
starting point guard, and Erik 
Murphy, UF’s leader in 3-point 
percentage, saw their minutes decrease in the final half due to a lack of focus and passion, Dono-
van said.
After playing 14 of the first 
20 minutes, Murphy was on the 
court for just seven in the second half because he was a “step slow” on defense. 
Walker, meanwhile, was 
yanked less than two minutes into the final half and sat until the 12:17 mark. Donovan said he 
wants to see more urgency and 
energy out of Walker, the Gators’ lone senior, with his UF career winding down. 
 “He’s got to step up and he’s 
got to try at least provide some leadership for our team,” Dono-van said. “As a senior, you would think that he would want to take 
that role, that responsibility, a lit-
tle bit and want that kind of thing and show that kind of passion.”

� UF BEAT DETROIT 22-3 ON 
SUNDAY AT DIZNEY STADIUM.
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Writer
 
The Gators’ offense followed 
Friday’s record-breaking perfor -
mance with an equally dominant 
showing Sunday. 
But their defense was even 
more overwhelming.
No. 4 Florida won its fourth 
straight game as it held Detroit to 
just 13 shots in a 22-3 win at Don-ald R. Dizney Stadium.
“We played really well,” ju-
nior defender Jamie Reeg said. “We kept it going the whole 60 minutes. We never let down.”
The 10 shots on goal and three goals for the Titans were both 
season lows for a UF opponent.
The Gators’ impressive defen-
sive effort came in the absence of 
2011 All-ALC First Team defend-er Sam Farrell, who sat out for 
precautionary reasons after being 
hit in the top of the head by a ball during warm-ups. 
“I was really happy though 
with how our defense responded without her,” O’Leary said. “She is a critical player in our defen-sive unit and one of the leaders back there.”
O’Leary praised freshmen 
midfielders Nicole Graziano and Nora Barry, who combined for five ground balls, for their help 
on the defensive end.
One of the most impressive 
sequences for the Florida defense came at the beginning of the sec-
ond half when Gators freshman midfielder Shannon Gilroy con-trolled the initial draw. 
Titans defender Morgan Lear 
intercepted Gilroy’s ensuing pass 
and took the ball 
inside Florida’s 
8-meter arc. 
Detroit main-
tained posses-
sion until the 26:43 mark, and 
the only shot it 
was able to get 
off the entire possession was a free-position shot that was saved 
by junior goalkeeper Mikey 
Meagher.
O’Leary said the defense had 
worked on not getting too anx-ious when teams held the ball for long periods of time like the Ti-
tans did to begin the second half, 
and she was pleased with how the defenders handled those situ-ations. 
That improved discipline 
resulted in the Gators playing their cleanest game of the season. Florida committed a season-low 16 fouls and did not receive a 
yellow card for the first time this 
season, avoiding any man-down situations. 
“We normally get stupid yel-
low cards that we don’t need,” 
Reeg said. “So for this game 
we focused on not swinging as much.”
The UF defense was also able 
to convert 16 of 20 clearance at-tempts. 
Gators’ junior attacker Gabi Wiegand finished with a game-high four goals on five shots and two assists, with her first two goals coming in the first minute 
and forty seconds of the game. 
She said the defenders were 
integral in jump-starting runs 
multiple times when the attack-
ers cut back for the ball.
“They did a great job in tran-
sition,” Wiegand said of the 
defenders. “Even off the draw, getting the ball up and out right 
away.”
O’Leary said she hopes Sun-
day’s performance is a sign of 
things to come from the defense.
“I’m optimistic about the fu-
ture,” O’Leary said. “Hopefully we can play a controlled game and get out of [games] with no yellow cards.”
Dominant defense helps Florida notch fourth straight victoryKATIE AGOSTIN

Although it was the men’s team that 
came into this weekend’s meet as defending 
champions, it was the women who added 
yet another Southeastern Conference title 
to the school’s history books Sunday. 
“(The women) sat down in the fall and 
they talked about what we were capable 
of doing and how we were going to get it 
done,” coach Mike Holloway said. “What you saw this weekend was a byproduct of that.”
The win brings the women’s program 
total to seven. 
Florida entered the final day in second place with 40 points, but Ciarra Brewer’s second-place finish in the triple jump (12.99m/42-7.50) earned eight more points 
for UF, putting it in a first-place tie with 
Arkansas.   
The 5,000 meter and the mile run were 
both huge events for the women, as the Gators earned 43 points thanks to a 1-2-5 
finish in the 5,000 meter and a 2-3-5-6 finish 
in the mile.
“I just knew I had to push hard and start 
strong,” said Florence Ngetich, winner of 
the 5,000 meter. “In this race, we wanted 
to push to be in front together so we could score more points and feed off each oth-er.”
The women’s first-place performance would not have been possible without Lanie Whittaker’s second- and Ebony Eutsey’s fifth-place finish in the 400 me-
ter, and Eutsey’s second-place finish in the 
4x400m. 
Although the men were unable to de-
fend their title, they still came through with a 
second-place finish, and 
a few individuals were able to repeat last year’s performance. Sophomore 
Eddie Lovett ran 7.78 in the 60m hurdles to take the title and Kemal Mesic 
won his third consecutive SEC shot put championship. Junior Omar Craddock also contributed 10 points to the men Sunday after winning the triple jump. 
“It’s a big accomplishment to win three 
in a row,” Mesic said. “Just winning one is a big deal.”
Jeff Demps, after setting the national 
best in the 60m in the prelims on Saturday 
with a 6.54, finished in third with a 6.64. 
Demps’ mark is .09 seconds slower than his winning time (6.55) from last season’s SEC indoor meet.  
After Sunday’s performance, Holloway 
has gained more confidence in both his teams as they start to focus on the NCAA Indoor Championships. 
UF athletes who have yet to achieve au-
tomatic-qualifying marks have two more opportunities to advance to the NCAA meet. 
“Overall, I’m just so pleased with how 
we did,” Holloway said.UF women’s track team takes home SEC Indoor Championship
