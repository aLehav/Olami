It took all of 10 seconds for ofﬁ  cials to 
decide that Florida Field was not capa-
ble of hosting a football game Saturday 
night.
But the decision on whether the Idaho 
Vandals will return to Gainesville and 
collect their $975,000 is one that Florida 
athletics director Jeremy Foley won’t an-
nounce until all the “moving parts” have ﬁ  nally settled.
“Obviously there’s a lot of questions 
out there as it relates to Saturday night’s 
game, what’s going on moving forward,” 
Foley said Monday before coach Will Muschamp’s weekly press conference. 
“We don’t have those answers yet . . . 
We’ll know something here (Tuesday) or Wednesday at the latest.”
After Florida’s season opener was of-
ﬁ  cially suspended following a 2-hour, 48-minute weather delay on Saturday night, the two schools were presented with four options.
The Gators and Vandals could resume 
the game with the “same time remain-ing and under the identical conditions of 
down, distance, ﬁ  eld position and player 
eligibility” at a later date — such as Oct. 25 when each team has a bye week.
They could also terminate the game 
with a determined ﬁ  nal score, forfeit the matchup or declare a “no contest.”
Both Foley and Idaho athletics direc-
tor Rob Spear are expected to continue talks throughout the week and determine 
which one of the four viable options is 
best for both schools.
Until that agreement has been made, 
Foley will not reveal any speciﬁ  c details 
about what will become of the $975,000 
owed to Idaho, or whether Florida will sacriﬁ  ce its bye week before the Georgia contest in order to fulﬁ  ll a 12-game regu-lar season.
“Obviously we need to reach out to 
the University of Idaho,” said Foley, who is the second-longest tenured athletics director among FBS schools.
“My staff and I met this morning and 
talked about possible scenarios. … We’re not trying to be secretive, there’s just a FLORIDA FIELD SWAMPED, OPENER SUSPENDED

Local police are working together 
to ﬁ  nd a suspect they believe was in-
volved in two separate sexual assault 
cases that occurred this weekend dur-
ing and after the delayed Gators foot-ball game.
At about 9:20 p.m. Saturday, 
Gainesville Police responded to a woman screaming near an area north of the stadium, located at 1824 NW Sec-ond Ave. Ofﬁ  cers arrived to ﬁ  nd a 21-year-old female victim who had been 
punched in the face. The man had ﬂ  ed the scene and is 
still at large. He ripped off the victim’s 
clothes as he attempted to sexually as-sault her, according to GDP Lt. Dan 
Stout.
After the victim fought off the 
6-foot-5-inch, heavy-set white man, he 
ﬂ  ed the scene wearing a blue Gators shirt, blending in with hoards of fans 
huddling from the rain and leaving the 
stadium. Stout said he had closely cut, brown hair and a beard.
A little after 1 a.m. Sunday, a simi-
larly described man with an orange 
Gators shirt was involved in an assault 
near the north side of Norman Hall.

There was only one play at the Gators’ 
season opener Saturday, but there was still 
plenty of action at the Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-dium.
The game’s early termination didn’t stop 
three people from getting arrested and 22 people from being ejected, according to University Police.
None of the gameday arrests involved 
UF students. Two were for battery charges, and one arrest involved resisting without violence.
Of the 22 people who were ejected, 16 were UF students.
The ejections included ﬁ  ve people in 
possession of alcohol, one person without a ticket, four people who ran onto the ﬁ  eld, four people accused of disorderly conduct, four for intoxication, two for ticket switch-ing, one for sitting in the wrong section 
and one for pushing a fan, according to the 
press release. 
UPD Captain Bart Knowles said, overall, 
Gators fans are pretty well-behaved. 
“Every game, we’re going to have some-
one who drinks too much and makes poor choices, but we traditionally have really great fans at UF,” Knowles said. “They’re 
very animated, loud, noisy and excited.”
Knowles said running onto the ﬁ  eld 
during a game is a rare occasion. The four 
people who did were contained and auto-matically ejected. 
Due to rain and lightning, a volun-
tary shelter was set up at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. Knowles said at its peak, about 2,000 people sought shelter there.Two dozen removed from game

Most people waited in the sheltered con-
course by the food and beverage vendors, 
according to Knowles.
“They hung out, drank Cokes and waited 
to see what was going to happen,” he said. 
Sarah Hoover, a 21-year-old UF market-
ing senior who grew up a Gators fan, said she stayed the entire game, rain and all. She had front row seats and gave her cowboy boots and phone to her friend who left be-fore her, leaving her barefoot.
“I knew it would be one of the greatest 
experiences if we all waited through ‘all kinds of weather’ to support our team after 
last year and help them start the season off 
right,” she said.
Throughout the game, the storm’s radar 
was displayed on the Jumbotron. Announc-er Mick Hubert repeatedly updated fans with weather information and surrounding lightning strikes. 
The game was officially canceled shortly 
after 10 p.m.
“We have some of the greatest fans in the 
world,” Knowles said. “They are the loudest but also some of the best behaved.”the then-canceled football game when 
a man jumped her from behind, ac-
cording to University Police Capt. Bart Knowles.
Stout said the man dragged the sec-
ond victim along the sidewalk and into 
the woods along the edge of campus, 
where he attempted to sexually assault her.
“When he pulled her down, there 
were luckily some witnesses not far 
behind her who heard her screams,” 
Knowles said. “At that time, the suspect took off.”
The man fled on foot on to campus 
after being chased off by witnesses, at 
which time responding officers request-
ed assistance from the GPD K-9 Unit.
Officers continued to patrol the area 
well into the morning. At about 2:40 
a.m., UPD received a call from a witness 
who said a man matching the reported description was near the Williamsburg Village apartments, just east of the UF College of Veterinary Medicine.
The witness told police the suspect 
asked for a ride to the ABV Motel at 1900 SW 13th St., where officers and the GPD K-9 Unit responded. They knocked 
on each hotel door and were again un-
successful in locating the suspect.
“As of right now, UPD detectives are 
working with GPD detectives to either verify or rule out the possibility that 
both incidents involved the same sus-
pect,” Knowles said.
Police ask that any information or 
suspicious activity be directly reported 
to UPD at 352-392-1111 or GPD at 352-

UF has approved the establish-
ment of a Center for Global Islam-
ic Studies for graduate students.
UF’s Center for Global Islamic 
Studies is set to launch Sept. 18 with a Global Islam and the Quest for Public Space conference.
The event will be the center’s 
first program for Islamic studies in Florida, said Terje Ostebo, an assistant professor with UF’s Cen-ter for African Studies and the De-
partment of Religion.“You take the Southeast of the 
U.S., and there are virtually no 
similar centers,” he said. “In Flor-
ida, we are the first one. I think 
it will have a huge impact in the way it puts UF on the map.”
Ostebo and several other col-
leagues have been coordinating efforts to create new classes for the program, along with adding current classes as well.
“We base on what we have 
and hope that we can grow and become something larger with time,” Ostebo said. 
“Our religion department doesn’t have a particular track or focus on Islam when it comes to grad studies.”
The center is working on add-
ing a minor, master’s and Ph.D. program down the road, but for now, graduate students can ob-
tain a graduate certificate in Is-
lamic studies, Ostebo said. 
The certificate will require 12 
to 15 credits from students.
Jamie Wenzell, a 23-year-old 
UF religion senior, said she would consider the graduate certificate. Wenzell is taking one of the new courses created for the center called Global Islam.
“It goes above and beyond re-
ligion and more about Islam’s in-
teraction in the world,” Wenzell 
said.
Ostebo said he wants the center 
to focus on a contemporary study of Islam.
“We want to emphasize Islam is much more than Saudi Arabia or the Middle East,” Ostebo said.
Brittney Abraham, a 22-year-
old UF religion senior, said she has taken Ostebo’s Global Islam course.
“He’s already given me a new 
perspective of Islam,” Abraham said.
The two-day conference will be 
open to the public and will feature Georgetown University professor 
John Esposito. 
The event will start at 5:30 p.m. 
in Pugh Hall’s Ocora Room.

Corrado Minardi opened up 
the Uber app this weekend ex-
pecting a free ride, but there were no cars available. 
Minardi, a 22-year-old UF po-
litical science senior, was one of the students who took to Twitter this weekend to denounce the service’s Labor Day promotion. It had promised ﬁ  ve free rides through Monday, but few people were picked up.
“I thought, ‘Oh, you know, 
that’s cool, I can get ﬁ  ve rides dur-
ing the weekend’,” Minardi said. 
“But if there are no cars available, then I can’t take the rides, so it’s like a useless promotion.”
He said he had to either walk 
or get rides from friends through-out the weekend.
“I just don’t see why they 
would offer that if they can’t de-liver,” he said.
Uber spokesman Taylor 
Bennett said once Uber grows throughout the city, more drivers 
will be available. 
“In testing phases like this, in 
the ﬁ  rst couple days as we contin-
ue to ramp up and bring on more partners, wait times might be a little longer,” he said. 
Bennett said the rain may have 
increased the demand for rides. 
Matt Collins, manager of 
Gainesville Cab Co., said the rain may have hurt business because people wanted to get home in-stead of standing in the rain wait-ing. He also said business was normal despite Uber’s presence. 
“It’s hard to say,” Collins said.

An inappropriate picture of UF’s chapter of Alpha Omicron 
Pi Sorority (AOPi) sisters is circulating on social media.
In the photo, ﬁ  ve sisters ﬂ  ash the camera while smiling and 
posing at a party.
One post on Facebook read, “And with this, the seniors say 
goodbye to Recruitment forever.” The photo has also appeared 
on Twitter and mentioned on the smartphone app, Yik Yak.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said the photo has come to 
the attention of UF administration.
“Steps are being taken to address the issue, and we talked 
to the chapter president and asked her to advise headquarters,” Sikes said.
As of now, UF has not taken disciplinary action against the 
sorority, she said.
“It doesn’t appear to be a conduct violation, but this is 
something these women will have to live with for the rest of their lives,” Sikes said.
This isn’t the ﬁ  rst time a picture has landed a Greek orga-
nization in hot water. In 2012, a picture of two brothers in Beta Theta Pi in blackface went viral.
Rachel Boison, the assistant director of public relations for 
the sorority’s international headquarters, said the Alpha Omi-cron Pi International Headquarters is dealing with the issue.
“We are aware of the photo, and we are in communication 
with the sorority and will stay in communication to monitor the situation,”  Boison said.
The local chapter of AOPi declined to comment.Sharing these images on Twitter is a form of cyberbullying, 
said Lyrissa Lidsky, associate dean for International Programs at the Levin College of Law.
“Cyberbullying is any kind of meanness perpetrated on-
line,” Lidsky said. “It can be emotionally devastating to be hu-miliated (online).”Racy photo of sorority sisters goes viral on social media

Fashion retailer Zara made headlines last week when it 
pulled a children’s shirt from its stores.
Customers complained that the shirt, which was 
marketed toward 3-year-olds, displayed shocking similari-ties to the uniforms Jews were forced to wear in the concen-
tration camps of Nazi Europe. With its long sleeves, blue and 
white stripes and six-pointed yellow star on the breast, the pajama shirt does strikingly resemble a concentration camp uniform.
Shortly after the shirt appeared online for sale, Zara un-
surprisingly received a firestorm of comments on social me-dia. The comments accused the retail giant of marketing an extremely insensitive product.
Within hours, the shirt was removed, and Zara issued a 
hasty apology in several languages via Twitter: “We hon-estly apologize, it was inspired by the sheriff’s stars from the Classic Western films and is no longer in our stores.”
I can forgive Zara for making a mistake; after all, what 
fashion retailer hasn’t tried to sell something that someone, at one point in time, found offensive? 
But in order for Zara to earn the respect and forgiveness 
of its customer base, it needs to prove that this appalling display of ignorance will not happen again. So far, I’m not 
convinced.
Anyone with even the most basic knowledge of World 
War II should understand how the design of the shirt can 
easily evoke images of pain and suffering from a terrible time in world history.
It’s shocking that not one person — not one designer, 
product developer or marketer — recognized the cultural and historic significance of such a design and anticipated the outrage it would inspire.
When you consider how social media users from all 
around the world immediately reacted in outrage and dis-gust after viewing the product, it’s difficult to fathom how this could have happened in the first place.
What’s even more difficult to understand is Zara’s ap-
parent inability to issue an apology less offensive than the product itself. 
As reported by +972 Magazine, a representative for Zara’s Israeli office (the shirt was available in Zara’s Israeli, French, Albanian and Swedish stores) promised that the product would be quickly removed from shelves 
and “exterminated.”
It’s fairly obvious that particular term may not have been 
the wisest choice of words in this situation.
I might be more willing to forgive these slip-ups if the 
company didn’t face a similar issue in 2007, when Zara was 
forced to pull a $78 handbag from stores after a customer no-ticed that the bag was embroidered with green swastikas. To be fair, the bag was produced in India, where the swastika is a symbol of good fortune for Hindus and Buddhists. 
However, the 21st century world largely associates the 
swastika with the Nazi party, and it is internationally rec-ognized as a powerful symbol of hate. Inditex, the multina-tional clothing company that owns Zara, has more than 6,000 stores in 88 markets. 
How could this international powerhouse not have the 
cultural awareness to predict the kind of reaction that swas-tikas on a handbag would produce? Why did no one in the company foresee this incredibly predictable outcome?
I’m not saying that Zara engages in discrimination or that 
it purposefully tried to offend people with these designs. In fact, giant fashion retailers usually have to produce new de-signs very quickly, so it’s reasonable that certain flaws may slip through the cracks. 
This isn’t about malice; it’s about ignorance, though both 
are inexcusable.
I hope Zara can learn from its mistakes and make an effort 
to be culturally sensitive, which should be especially impor-
tant for a company with such a broad international reach. 
But if Zara fails to apologize in a way that actually ac-
knowledges the offensiveness of its actions and makes no 
genuine effort to express remorse to the people who were rightfully pained by the design, then I doubt it has learned anything at all.

this weekend? Today’s question: Did you use Uber this weekend?Corporations and 
Obama’s student 
loan decision
In the 2010 case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Com-
mission, the Supreme Court ruled that corporations, for all intents and purposes, are human beings with the same rights 
as any American citizen. Citizens United and the recent Hobby Lobby case established that corporations are protected by the 
First Amendment, with both freedom of speech and religion.
If corporations are going to have the same rights as American 
citizens, it seems only logical that they be held to the same stan-
dard and must obey the laws of the U.S.
Unfortunately, because corporations are legal constructs and 
not actually people, it is difficult to hold them accountable when they break the law. After all, you can’t send a corporation to prison.
Ideally, the senior executives of these corporations would be 
held liable for criminal activity committed under their supervi-sion.
But rather than prosecuting these leaders for the misconduct 
of their corporations, the U.S. government often seeks negoti-ated monetary settlements. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. paid $550 million to the government for its role in engineering the catas-trophe.
To put that number into perspective, Goldman Sachs earned 
$3.5 billion in profits during the first three months of 2010 alone. For large corporations like Goldman, these fines are minor nui-sances at worst.
This leniency toward delinquent corporations has been a 
hallmark of the Obama administration, most recently in the area of student loan policy.
In May, student loan specialist Navient agreed to pay the 
government $139 million after it was accused of intentionally cheating U.S. military personnel on their federal student loans. 
Navient “swindled up to 60,000 service members out of tens of 
millions of dollars” by charging unfair fees and illegally raising interest rates on the loans.
Navient executives faced no legal action, and the Department 
of Education recently announced that it will require more stu-dents to deal with the company for their loans.
Essentially, this means that Navient will be receiving more 
taxpayer dollars as compensation for the loan work it does for the government. The company already manages 5.8 million stu-
dent loan accounts, so it seems likely that it will quickly recoup 
its losses from the settlement.
The fines that the Obama administration levies on corpora-
tion lawbreaking are not an effective deterrent. Instead, they send the message that corporations are free to break any law they please — for the right price.
At a time when the U.S. has the world’s highest incarceration 
rate, the disparity in law enforcement between corporations and 
ordinary citizens could not be more apparent. It’s time to hold 
corporations, particularly corporate executives, truly account-able for their illegal actions.

As the school year begins, UF students 
are preparing for the upcoming foot-ball season, the Greek fraternities 
and sororities are gearing up for Recruit-ment Week, and eager freshmen are stum-
bling through campus adorned with their 
Preview lanyards.
In the midst of all this hectic activity, it’s 
easy to forget the continuing state of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, where an 18-year-old unarmed teenager named Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer.
According to several eyewitnesses, Of-
ficer Darren Wilson shot Brown, who had 
his hands up in surrender before falling to 
the ground into a pool of his own blood. In response to Brown’s death, angry Ferguson residents took to the streets in protest.
After leaving Michael Brown’s body on 
the street for four hours, officers carried him out in a police SUV, equating his body to that of road kill. A lengthy police report was soon released claiming that Brown was a suspect in a convenience store robbery even though Wilson did not know whether Brown was a suspect.
Through its investigation, 
the St. Louis County Police Department has since been closed off and silent about its on-going investigation amid calls for an arrest or an autopsy report.
In the aftermath of Brown’s death, the 
news media and the Ferguson Police De-partment have been actively trying to derail discussion about the true injustice at hand: A black unarmed teenager was shot and 
killed by a white police officer for no justi-
fiable reason. Instead, the focus has largely been on Brown’s alleged act of robbery be-fore his death and reports that Brown may have used marijuana in the past.
Even if either of these accusations are 
true, they in no way justify the action Wilson took in shooting Brown.
Another issue underreported by the mainstream media is the grow-ing problem of police brutality in America. Police responded to the Ferguson protesters with a series of gross overreactions, 
using rubber bullets and tear gas on peaceful protesters after riding in on armored tanks armed with semi-automatic rifles. Police clearly used these threats as an intimidation tactic to cause unnecessary escalation.
The reaction of the police was so severe 
and brutal that even citizens of Gaza extend-ed their sympathies and support to Fergu-son residents. 
The news media have failed in their cov-
erage of Ferguson in other ways. They rarely reported about people passing out free food to protesters, people passing out milk to re-lieve tear gas victims, the voter registration drives that popped up, the protesters stop-ping looters and rioters in their tracks, or Mi-chael Brown’s memorial, where 1,000 roses were laid on the very street he was killed on. The memorial has since been trampled on by a police car and urinated on by police dogs. 
It is important to note that this flare-up in 
racial tension is a part of a larger nationwide crisis in which black lives are devalued and 
ignored.The rage and anger felt by residents 
of Ferguson is completely understandable because the murders of unarmed black peo-ple are stories that are all too common.
As a black person, society sees your skin 
color as a weapon regardless of your socio-economic status, education or national ori-gin.
Brown was a man with a future. He was 
days away from attending trade school to become an A/C and heater technician. Re-gardless of any previous misconduct, he did not deserve to have his life taken away. His memory must be honored, and the wider so-cial problems his death represents must be acknowledged.

Media fall short with Ferguson, police brutality coverageColumn
My laptop comes ev-erywhere with me. It comes with me 
to both work, where it gets scratched, and on vacation, 
where it gets a frightening dent. 
It goes online with me, from study-
ing the history of the Republican Party 
for a research paper to learning how to incorporate handfasting into a wed-
ding.
But the one place it goes every day 
is into the classroom, and where it con-
nects from there is my business only. Some teachers, especially in lectures, discourage the use of laptops or check out what a student is viewing. I believe this is an invasion of privacy and ulti-mately unhelpful to a student’s career.
Typical laptop usage in a classroom 
can consist of taking notes on Word documents, OneNote lists and Power-Point slides. However, no one can deny that sometimes, it just isn’t enough. 
Lecture halls aren’t always the en-
gaging, illuminating method of deliv-ery that some believe they are. I’ve had this problem since I learned to read — I 
want to know more. I want to Google 
new case studies or take the test or quiz the teacher mentioned. If a teacher doesn’t provide the stimulation I want, I go looking for it.
A classmate of mine used his phone 
a few days ago to ask a professor an ethics question after searching for more information about a certain historical 
figure. I remember that the most out of 
the entire lecture. To curtail this sort of nontraditional learning increases the likelihood that students won’t make their own personal connections to the material.
I’m not going to pretend all my ex-
tracurricular Googling is for the greater scholastic good. I also check my social 
media and read the news. College stu-
dents lead some of the most stressful lives in the U.S., and they’re looked down on for taking breaks.
The MIT Center for Academic Excel-
lence suggests the most effective study-ing is done in one-hour blocks. Breaks might actually be productive if spaced efficiently during class time. The added stress of stu-
dents hiding what they’re doing or worrying about the teacher seeing them doesn’t facilitate a relaxed learning 
environment, which further distances students from the material.
However, this freedom means an 
increase in responsibility for grades. Taking charge of the information ab-sorbed also increases the duty of sifting through and making sense of it. It’s not just a laptop, either. 
Checking Twitter over someone’s 
shoulder and taking notes at the same time can be just as distracting as read-ing your own feed. 
Former teaching assistant and educa-
tion columnist Rebecca Schuman wrote in Slate that she feels banning laptops creates a “13th-grade classroom.”
“Policing the (otherwise non-disrup-
tive) behavior of students further infan-
tilizes these 18- to 22-year-olds,” Schu-
man said. “Already these students are hand-held through so many steps in the academic process: I check homework; I give quizzes about the syllabus to make sure they’ve actually read it....These practices also serve as giant, scholastic water wings for people who should re-ally be swimming by now.”
If you need a 3.5 GPA, and you 
haven’t looked up from your screen all semester, you won’t find help from the instructor very easily. Your professor has the right to bump you to the bottom of the list during packed office hours or mark you harshly on essays that cover topics from the lecture. 
Instructors are justified in their an-
noyance when they present information and their students don’t listen and then ask them to explain it later. 
As adults, we should be able to judge 
what needs our full attention and what can just stay open in the next window while we check SportsCenter. 
When teachers don’t receive respect, 
students won’t get it back. Balance your 
time wisely to make the most of your 
electronics and your learning.

In my three years at UF, di-
versity has been at the center 
of my experience. I partici-
pated in the Gatorship retreat my freshman year and learned how to make campus more inclusive. 
At UF, we have an incredible range of 
diversity: religious, racial/ethnic, sex and gender identity, and nationality, just to 
name a few. These types of diversity stem 
from typically observable, easily recogniz-
able characteristics. 
Ask any student organization that pro-
motes diversity to define what “diversity” is, and you’ll likely hear the term’s social 
definition: “different kinds of people.” 
They’ll typically give you the examples I’ve 
given: religion, race, ethnicity, gender, etc. 
However, there is one category of diver-
sity that is frequently not part of the con-
versation, a category into which I and many 
others fall: neurodiversity.
When I say the word “neurodiversity,” 
people chuckle. It’s a somewhat unusual word that almost sounds made up. People 
often give me a confused look because they 
have never heard the term. Neurodiversity often isn’t as observable as other forms of 
diversity, but it exists on the UF campus 
nonetheless. 
Neurodiversity occurs in the mind and 
falls under the spectrum of “invisible dis-abilities,” which includes learning disabili-ties, autism spectrum disorders, develop-
mental disorders, etc. We don’t often think 
about these conditions as part of the diver-
sity conversation because we often think of 
disabilities as being visible.
I open this conversation of neurodiver-
sity because I am a neurodiverse individual. I hope to use this opportunity to educate the 
UF community about the issues and strug-
gles that I — and others like me — face on 
a regular basis.
I am a woman on the autism spectrum. 
My mind works differently than those of 
most other people. 
Autism is a neurological disability, 
which means that it affects brain function. 
I sometimes compare the differences be-
tween my brain and “normal” ones to those between a Mac and a PC. They essentially perform the same functions but 
in somewhat different ways. I 
hit some of life’s major mile-
stones at different times than 
the average person. For exam-
ple, I never lived away from home until my freshman year of college. Many others may 
have spent time away from home at a sleep-
away camp when they were just 8 or 9 years 
old. Being on the autism spectrum means I 
sometimes miss social cues that might seem 
instinctual to most people. This does not 
make me — or any of my autistic or neu-rodiverse counterparts — a lesser person. 
We are members of a minority — one that 
often goes unnoticed and is invisible unless 
explicitly disclosed.
Neurodiversity is not a supported form 
of diversity on campus, nor are we often rec-
ognized as a distinct group of individuals. 
The Disability Resource Center provides us 
the academic support we may need to suc-ceed, but it is not a center of culture like La 
Casita or the Institute of Black Culture. 
There are also no student organizations 
comprised of neurodiverse individuals, 
people with disabilities or their allies. We go unnoticed until one of us speaks out about 
our status or supports a nonprofit that spe-
cializes in engaging with the neurodiverse.
I ask you not to discriminate or judge. I 
know I speak for others like myself when I say I have been treated differently or dis-criminated against because I am autistic and 
a neurodiverse individual. I am not a lesser 
person because of my challenges, no matter 
if they appear invisible to the uninformed 
or untrained eye. 
The neurodiverse constitute a real minor-
ity. Unfortunately, the disabled community faces enough prejudice, pity and negative 
stigma as is. The failure to recognize and 
support neurodiversity only makes matter 
worse.
I ask for respect. And most importantly, 
I ask you treat me or any other individual 
with neurodiversity like anybody else — with kindness, respect and dignity. Your 
inclusion can make all the difference in my 
life or in somebody else’s.

About 150 incoming female engi-
neering students made a trip to Lake 
Wauburg for UF’s Society of Women Engineers eSwamp Day.
The 11th annual event was held to en-
courage women to stay in the engineer-ing ﬁ  eld.
A series of speeches on succeeding in 
engineering took place on campus before the students headed to Lake Wauburg. Students took part in canoe races, discus-sions with corporate sponsors, an engi-neering fair and SWE’s Big Gator Little Gator Mentoring Program.
Tania Jarquin, the eSwamp Day di-
rector and SWE recording secretary, said she wanted to encourage female attend-ees to not “let tough and male dominat-ed classes” stop them from pursuing the ﬁ  eld.
“SWE is just like a support system 
to make sure that you accomplish your goals or ﬁ  nd your dreams,” the 22-year-old UF chemical engineering senior, said.  
More than 230 students registered for 
the UF organization this year.
Erin Winick, SWE president and a 
20-year-old UF mechanical engineering 
junior, was the only female during her 
summer internship working on turbine engines at Solar Turbines in California. She said the SWE mentoring program helped her ﬁ  nd her niche in the engi-neering ﬁ  eld.
“When I came into SWE as an explor-
atory engineer, it really helped me so-lidify my path and be more conﬁ  dent in 
what I was going into,” she said.  
Corporate sponsors like Harris Co., 
the international communications and 
information technology company, spoke to engineering students at the event.
Christine Chern, an 18-year-old UF 
chemical engineering sophomore, said the event was a great way to make con-nections and meet engineering majors.

feel like they can make a difference in the Female engineers gatherRESEARCH

Millions of dollars in research awards 
were granted to UF last year, surpassing past 
records.
Colleges on campus were on the receiving 
end of $702 million, $24 million more than the previous amount of $678 million in 2010.
Among the recipients, UF’s College of 
Medicine in Gainesville and Jacksonville re-ceived $366 million. 
The amount will go toward funding exist-
ing projects, as well as a few new ones, said 
Stephen Sugrue, senior associate dean of re-
search affairs at UF.
“The College of Medicine chose not to 
open new areas of research in order to focus more on strengthening the ones they have, for the most part,” he said. “The awards we received were largely attributed to our en-hancement and team science.”
Sugrue said recent hires and previous grant recipients are working together on cur-rent projects.
The colleges sent out research proposals 
for funding consideration.
David Norton, UF vice president for re-
search, said the money received was a posi-tive reﬂ  ection on the faculty.
“Our faculty have an incredible amount of 
talent and commitment to their projects,” he 
said. 
About 6,000 individual projects were 
handed in to agencies by UF colleges, Nor-
ton said. Some of the agencies contributing to UF’s research funding include the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Department of Energy. 
Among them, the College of Engineering 
brought in $63 million, the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences brought in $102 
million and the College of Liberal Arts and 
Sciences brought in $35 million, according to a press release.
Students such as Dianmarie De Jesus, a 21-
year-old biology senior, said she came to UF because of its status as a research school.
“A large budget for the school means 
a large budget for the faculty doing the re-search,” she said. “It raises the esteem of the 
school and helps students who are interested 
in assisting with research, too.”UF breaks record for grants

Same-sex marriage could 
be legalized in Florida by the 
end of this month.
U.S. District Judge Robert 
Hinkle ruled on Aug. 21 that the state’s ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. 
In doing so, Hinkle dis-
missed Attorney General Pam Bondi from reviewing and ap-pealing future same-sex mar-riage cases, leaving the fate of the ruling in the hands of three people, two of whom were ap-pointed by Gov. Rick Scott.
If Washington County 
Clerk of Court Harold Bazzel or Scott’s appointees, Craig J. Nichols, secretary of the 
Florida Department of Man-
agement Services, and State Surgeon General John H. Arm-
strong, do not appeal Hinkle’s 
ruling, same-sex marriage will 
be legalized on Sept. 22.
Bondi’s dismissal came 
after she continued to appeal 
county cases that ruled against 
the state’s same-sex marriage 
ban, including those in Palm 
Beach, Miami-Dade and Bro-
ward counties this summer. 
Her actions adhered to 
federal law regarding same-sex marriage, but they were viewed as a political delay tactic because her appeals also prevented the state’s Supreme 
Court from hearing the cases.
“They can dismiss an in-
dividual from a case if they 
feel the person is not a correct representative of the issue,” 
said Aimee Cernicharo, staff 
attorney at the St. Thomas 
University Human Rights In-stitute in Miami. “It is possible but highly unusual to dismiss 
the attorney general, who is 
technically the top legal pro-
fessional.”
In 2008, voters approved of 
Florida’s ban of same-sex mar-
riage. Yet in recent months, 
state court cases have ruled 
for its legalization.
Terry Fleming, spokesman 
for the Pride Community Cen-
ter of North Central Florida, 
said the organization is wait-
ing to see what happens in the next couple of months.
“(We) plan to monitor the 
appellate court decisions,” he said. “It could take a number of months or years.”
Valerie Rinaman, a 19-
year-old UF exploratory engi-neering sophomore, said she would prefer if Florida voters  made the decision.
“It’s better for people to 
vote on it, rather than waiting for the Supreme Court to en-force it,” Rinaman said.Judge removes Bondi

A Gainesville man was arrested 
and charged with DUI and criminal 
mischief after sideswiping a parked car late Sunday night.
At about 11:40 p.m., 20-year-old 
Richard Joseph Holder was travel-ing westbound on the 800 block of Northwest Ninth Avenue.
Holder then hit a car that was 
parked on the street, according to the arrest report.
The crash caused about $700 
worth of damage.
Gainesville Police officer Aaron Stemen respond-
ed to the scene a little after mid-night on Mon-day. Officers said they smelled al-cohol on Holder’s breath. 
H o l d e r 
worked at the Of-
fice Depot on West Newberry Road, according to the report.
Three witnesses said they came 
outside after the sound of the crash. They said Holder was in the driver’s seat, revving the engine.Stemen read Holder his Miranda 
rights and informed him that he was conducting a criminal DUI investi-gation.
Holder then performed poorly 
on field sobriety tests. Stemen ar-rested him at the scene for driving under the influence.
Holder’s blood alcohol content 
samples clocked in at .154 and .159. The legal limit is .08.
During the 20-minute breath test, 
officers said Holder fell asleep. 
Holder was booked into Alachua 
County Jail at 1:50 a.m. Monday, where he remained as of press time. Man charged with criminal mischief

Volleyball drops in polls
Despite going 3-0 in the Active Ankle Challenge, the 
UF volleyball team dropped one spot to No. 11 in the AVCA coaches poll, released on Monday.Percy Harvin is ready to compete for the Seattle Seahawks after injuries limited him in 2013. Read 
the story on Page 15.JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
At the start of Florida’s practice on Monday, the first since 
its season opener against Idaho was suspended, coach Will 
Muschamp said the team focused first on going through film from the game — all 10 seconds of it.
“We started as a team and watched all the plays from 
Saturday night,” Muschamp said. “(It) took a long time.”
After a two hour, 48 minute lightning delay, the Gators 
and the Vandals completed the opening kickoff before more lightning and rain suspended play at Ben Hill Griffin for good on Saturday.
“I didn’t think they were going to call 
it,” said redshirt junior Valdez Showers, 
who returned the opening kickoff for 64 yards, “but once I saw them hold the of-
fense I knew it probably was going to get 
cancelled.”
Muschamp said that with the return 
of Andre Debose — who is tied for the Southeastern Conference record with four career kickoff return touchdowns — op-
posing kickoff teams are going to shy away from kicking the ball to the redshirt senior.
“You’ve got to ready for all alternative kicks - squibs, 
skies,” Muschamp said. “I tell (special teams coordinator) Coleman (Hutzler) all the time, ‘I wouldn’t kick to (De-bose).’ I would kick away from the guy. Make someone else beat you.”
Added Showers: “If the field was better, I was definitely 
looking to cut back. But I knew there was a chance I would slip so I was just trying to get as much yardage as I could.”
Showers, a Detroit native, is used to playing in less-than-
perfect weather conditions.
“I mean it was pretty slippery, but I’m from up North so 
I’ve played in all types of weather — a lot of snow,” Show-ers said. “So I was ready to play the game regardless.”
Suspensions lifted: Nose tackles Darious Cummings 
and Jay-nard Bostwick (violation of team rules) and wide receiver Demarcus Robinson (university sanction) will be eligible to play against Eastern Michigan on Sunday, Mus-champ announced Monday.
The three players were originally suspended for the Ida-
ho game.
“(Cummings and Bostwick) will be back this week with 
us,” Muschamp said. “Not just as far as the suspension of 
a game, but they’ve handled a lot of other things for me, as 
well as Demarcus Robinson, who had a university sanction that’s been resolved.”
Offense progressing: The Gators did not have the op-
portunity to showcase Kurt Roper’s up-tempo offense, but Muschamp feels the group is ready for Saturday’s game against Eastern Michigan.
“There’s not as many question marks that I thought there 
would be going into the season positionally,” Muschamp said. “Schematically, I think we have answers for a lot of different things. I feel very comfortable with where we are. 
Again, we haven’t done it against an opponent yet. We’ll 
have to see how that goes.”
The Eagles finished 120th in total defense in 2013, giving 
up 510.6 yards per game.
In its 31-28 season-opening win against Morgan State, 
Eastern Michigan surrendered 479 yards.
Christy to start at punter: Kyle Christy had a rough sea-son in 2013.
One year removed from being a finalist for the Ray Guy 
award given to the best punter, Christy found himself warm-ing the bench after Florida’s 17-6 loss to LSU on Oct. 12 after averaging a meager 39.6 yards per punt for the season.
Muschamp announced Monday that Christy will be the 
team’s starting punter over Johnny Townsend, giving Chris-ty the opportunity to return to his sophomore-year form.
“I asked our team, I said, ‘look at Kyle and Johnny. You 
make that decision,’ because they’re both really good play-ers and there’s only one punter,” Muschamp said. “It’s not like another position where you can contribute on a cover-age unit or a return unit.”

Alligator Staff Writer @edenotero_l
Last year, Florida relied on senior setter 
Taylor Brauneis.
This year, the weight of the setter po-
sition rests heavily on Mackenzie Dagos-
tino’s shoulders.
In Florida’s season opener Friday, the 
Gators faced off against Georgia Southern 
(0-3) and Idaho (1-2).
From the first serve of the Georgia 
Southern game, it was smooth sailing 
for Dagostino and her teammates — the Gators swept both the Eagles and the Van-dals — but it was on Saturday that fans be-gan to see Dagostino’s fatigue from play-ing back-to-back games against fast and 
gritty teams.
After playing 
just 47 sets in her 
first year at UF, Dagostino spent 
almost all of her time on the court in the two days of competition, a decision coach Mary Wise credits to trying to build Da-gostino and her teammates confidence in 
the setter.
“She really made great strides, just from 
last night to today in finding the rhythm with her hitters,” Wise said after Florida’s 
3-2 win against Oklahoma University (2-1) on Saturday.
 “You can’t demonstrate this atmo-
sphere in practice. To be there in this sit-uation in set five, to be able to make the sets. You change your quarterback, that’s a huge change for any team. We have a 
lot of work to do, both defensively and of-
fensively, but we also like what the future looks like.”
Those strides that Wise is referring to 
are Dagostino’s staggering escalation in her assists (Georgia Southern, 23, Idaho, 38, and Oklahoma, 51) and the junior’s ability to move all over the court.
Throughout the sets, the Tampa native 
consistently improved her game. In Flori-
da’s sweep of Idaho she had nine assists in 
the first set, 14 assists in the second and 15 in the third.
In her third and final match of the week-
end, Dagostino recorded 51 assists in the 
five-set match — breaking her single-game 
record of 43 assists set against Florida State on Oct. 14, 2012.
With her progression in the starting 
setter position and Wise’s choice to keep Dagostino receiving extensive playing time in early season action

“Not again.” 
Valdez Showers
UF wide receiver on the weather delay following his kickoff return
lot of different things we have to consider. And we are 
working through those things as we speak.”
If UF does pay Idaho the nearly million-dollar pay-
out that the two schools agreed upon in 2009, the money won’t be transferred until Feb. 1 — which is part of Flori-da’s “standard language” in football contracts.
The last time Florida dealt with rescheduling during 
the season was when Hurricane Frances forced the Gators to push back their 2004 season opener against Middle Ten-nessee — originally scheduled on Sept. 4 — to the middle of their Southeastern Conference schedule on Oct. 16.
If the Florida-Idaho game were to be rescheduled for 
Oct. 25 in Gainesville, the Gators would then be forced to end their regular season playing nine games in as many weeks.
“I haven’t even really thought about it,” Muschamp 
said. 
“I’m going to control the controllables, and right now 
I have zero control of that situation. And once I’m told whatever we’re going to do, we’re going to go after it full 
speed.”
Valdez Showers, who returned Saturday’s opening 
kickoff 64 yards in the game’s only play, spoke with the 
media Monday and stressed the importance of having a bye week in the midst of a treacherous SEC slate.
“It’s a long season and, to be honest with you, a lot of 
players take advantage of those bye weeks, trying to re-ally get in the treatment room and get treated up during the off week,” said the redshirt junior receiver. “But we 
definitely look forward to those bye weeks.”
If Florida decides to preserve its off-week, Foley would 
then be tasked with the challenge of possibly reimbursing 
Idaho for making the 2,738-mile trek — not to mention the hassle of handling the ticket situation for Gator fans.“We’re trying to figure out all those things right now,” 
Foley said. 
“Again, when we come forward with whatever deci-
sion we come forward with, we’re going to have answers to everything financially, dates, tickets, reasons, all that sort of things. We’re just not there yet.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2014

Florida huddles on the field prior to kickoff in its season opener against Idaho on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin Sta -
dium. The game, which was initially delayed two hours and 48 minutes due to lightning, was suspended after field 
conditions were deemed unsafe to play. Details regarding possible game rescheduling have not been finalized.
Both Gators and Vandals have a bye week on Oct. 25

‘Bama has shaky Week 1

Week 1 of the college football season has come 
and gone, and the slate of games gave us a lot to 
digest. Let’s look at some of the major takeaways from the weekend of games, and look ahead at the best games for week two.
College Football’s Goliaths Have Shaky 
Debuts
Two teams that entered 2014 already pen-
ciled into the College Football Playoff — Ala-bama and Florida State — showed Saturday even they have weaknesses, ones that need to be fixed if they want to win a national title.
Alabama entered its matchup as a 26.5-
point favorite, facing a West Virginia team 
that finished 4-8 last year.
But head coach Dana Holgorsen hit Nick 
Saban’s defense with the bane of his defen-
sive philosophy’s existence — an up-tempo scheme. Mountaineers quarterback Clint Trickett exploited the inexperienced Tide sec-ondary all night and threw for 365 yards and a touchdown.
The good news for Saban and offensive co-
ordinator Lane Kiffin is the Tide offense is in capable hands with fifth-year senior quarter-back Blake Sims. 
He completed 72.7-percent of his passes, 
and orchestrated two scoring drives in the third quarter to respond to the Mountaineers’ scores to keep it close.
If there’s any bright spot in a Tide defense 
that Saban called “soft” at halftime Saturday, 
it’s the front seven. The unit gave up just 28 
yards total on the ground.
Alabama would walk away with a ten 
point victory, and some major adjustments to be made.
Defending national champion Florida State 
showed vulnerabilities as well. The ‘Noles en-tered as 19-point favorites, but came out with a shaky, six point victory.
Reigning Heisman trophy winner Jameis 
Winston threw two interceptions in the second quarter, but he redeemed himself in the sec-ond half with a 25 yard touchdown run and a 50 yard touchdown pass to Rashad Greene to put the ‘Noles up 13 in the fourth. That would be his only passing touchdown of the night.
Oklahoma State would score a late touch-
down in the fourth to pull within six, but was unable to get its offense back on the field. The ‘Noles defense also gave up 31 points and 364 yards Saturday.
A win is a win, but the ‘Noles showed some 
vulnerability Saturday against an unranked, rebuilding Oklahoma State team.
Two SEC Surprises
Texas A&M and Georgia are now on every-
one’s radar after an impressive opening week.
The Aggies went into a hostile Williams-
Brice Stadium to face South Carolina, who 
was 7-0 in Thursday night season openers since Spurrier took over in 2005.
Sophomore quarterback Kenny Hill 
knocked the Gamecock defense’s lights out.
He completed 73 percent of his passes, 
and surpassed Manziel’s single-game passing record with 511 yards in a 52-28 rout of the Gamecocks.
The bottom line here is that A&M coach 
Kevin Sumlin can flat out coach, regardless of who the personnel is out on the field. If they keep it up, the Aggies could now be a sleeper to win the SEC West.
Those who picked South Carolina to win 
the SEC East are kicking themselves this week 
because of one man: Todd Gurley.
The Georgia tailback looked so impressive 
against the Clemson Tigers that it was almost 
scary. He racked up a Georgia-record 293 all-purpose yards, including a 100-yard kickoff 
return.
The ‘Dawg’s defense also looked much im-
proved under new defensive coordinator Jer-
emy Pruitt, allowing just 291 total yards and held Clemson to three negative yardage drives in the fourth.
Get Better in Week 2Two teams that need to greatly improve 
this week are UCLA and Ohio State. 
Both teams did win, but Ohio State needed 
the fourth quarter to pull away from Navy at a “neutral-site” in Maryland, and UCLA leaned almost entirely on its defense to score. If the Bruins plan to contend in the high-scoring PAC-12, they’ll need to score a lot more points offensively.
Ohio State plays a much more quality op-
ponent in Virginia Tech this week — could the 
Hokies make the Buckeyes sweat for the sec-
ond week in a row?Mad Hatter Does it Again
LSU head coach Les Miles continues to be 
successful year in and year out in opening 
week games. 
LSU was down 17 points at the start of the 
third quarter, and the Tigers responded with 21 unanswered points to sneak past Wisconsin in Houston. Tailback Kenny Hilliard capped it off with a 28-yard touchdown run in the fourth. 
Perhaps even more impressive, LSU now 
has 22 wins under Miles when trailing in the fourth.

The reigning Super Bowl cham-
pion Seattle Seahawks will kick 
off regular season play against the 
Green Bay Packers at 8:30 p.m. on Thursday. Former Gator Percy Har-
vin, who returned the second half 
opening kick for 87 yards to help se-
cure Seattle’s first Super Bowl win, will be looking to compete this year after only playing one regular sea-son game in 2013.  Harvin was on the disabled list 
for most of 2013 after undergoing 
hip surgery. 
The wide receiver made strides 
in camp and exceeded coaches ex-
pectations so far. He’s been able to practice on back-to-back days in-stead of every other day—as origi-nally planned.
“I think the biggest thing with me 
was my hip it was controlling a lot of the hamstrings, knee problems and things like that,” Harvin told media after practice on Aug. 20. “My legs 
are just feeling how they are sup-
posed to feel, it’s very fluent, very smooth, it’s all good.”
Rookies set for season opener: 
NFL play will pick back up with 13 scheduled games on Sunday. 
Dominique Easley, the 29th over-
all pick from the 2014 Draft, report-edly secured a 4-year, $7.3 million 
contract and a $3.63 million signing 
bonus with the New England Patri-ots.
The defensive tackle is still nurs-
ing a torn ACL he suffered during a non-contact drill on Sept. 24. Ac-cording to the Boston Herald, the Patriots hope Easley will make his NFL debut during New England’s 
season opener Sunday in Miami.
Fourth-round draft pick Jaylen 
Watkins and undrafted tight end 
Trey Burton join fellow Gator Riley 
Cooper on Philadelphia’s 53-man 
roster. In his four years at UF, Bur-ton played 50 games, recorded 720 rushing yards, 976 receiving yards and made 20 touchdowns at wide receiver, tight end, fullback and quarterback.
Ronald Powell, a fifth-round 
draft pick for the New Orleans, managed to make the Saints 53-man, post-training camp roster. Powell finished 2013 with 26 tackles 
and led the Gators with four sacks 
last season.
The New England Patriots re-
leased Florida’s fourth and final 
drafted player from the class of 
2014. Jon Halapio was cut on Satur-day as part of the team’s final roster moves. 
McDonald arrested: San Fran-
cisco 49ers’ Ray McDonald landed himself in a Santa Clara County Jail early Sunday morning. McDonald was arrested on felony domestic vi-
olence chargers. McDonald posted 
bail and was released later Sunday. According to the Sacramento Bee, police arrived at McDonald’s house around 2 a.m. During a birthday 
celebration he was hosting, he ap-
peared to have an altercation with his fiancée.
This is the first domestic violence 
issue to take place within the NFL since commissioner Roger Goodell announced a mandatory six-game suspension for first domestic vio-lence offence.TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

On what was their first of four 
consecutive weekend road trips 
this season, the Gators showed how quickly they can put a loss behind them and focus on what is 
more important: the next game.
No. 6 Florida (3-1) faced the 
Oklahoma Sooners (2-1-1) on 
Friday night in Norman, Okla., in the first of six straight away games.
It didn’t start well for Florida, 
as sophomore Rachel Ressler gave the Sooners an early goal in 
the sixth minute of play.
When Flor-
ida fell behind 
2-0 after giv-ing up a pen-alty kick to senior Abby Hodgen in the 63rd minute, 
it proved to be 
too much to 
overcome. Although sophomore Savannah Jordan found the back of the net in the 72nd minute and junior Christen Westphal had good opportunities late, Florida’s first loss of the season came in the Sooner state, a final of 2-1.
“The good thing is the only 
way you can forge resilience is through adversity,” coach Becky Burleigh said following Friday’s loss. “So now we have a little ad-versity in front of us and it is time for us to show some resilience and bounce back.”
Bounce back is exactly what 
Florida did on Sunday in Stillwa-ter, Okla., as it faced Oklahoma State.
The Gators went into their 
match against the Cowgirls (0-4) two days after their first loss of the season. 
But that game was long over. 
This game is what mattered now.
Florida came out looking to 
attack and got a goal from se-nior Havana Solaun in just the third minute of the match — the 
earliest goal of the season for the 
Gators and Solaun’s first of the year.
Jordan added the second goal 
of the game in the 74th minute, and the Gators never looked back.
In all, four different players 
scored for Florida on Sunday as it 
went on to beat Oklahoma State 
4-0. 
Junior Brooke Smith added 
her first career goal in the 87th minute and sophomore Brooke Sharp put in her first of the year with only 36 seconds left in reg-ulation. Senior Tessa Andujar contributed two assists, making 
it her first double-assist match of 
her career.
Florida received huge contri-
butions from all over the field, a lot of which weren’t from start-ers. Redshirt sophomore goal-
keeper Valerie Tysinger replaced 
senior Taylor Burke to begin the second half; the two combined for the shutout.
“To come out with a 4-0 win 
on the road is a good response,” Burleigh said after Sunday’s vic-tory. “Our depth really played a big role in this game today.”Florida soccer splits 
first road weekendDagostino played in all 11 sets
her in for every set, Dagostino 
played a total of 11 sets by Satur-day night and was only subbed 
once with freshman setter Abby 
Detering, who managed only three assists before the end of the match against Georgia Southern.
While Detering came to Flor-
ida in spring, Dagostino’s expe-rience under Brauneis gives her the leg up for the starting posi-tion.
So while Wise is focused on 
keeping Dagostino in sets as long as possible, Dagostino said there is no guarantee to her starting.
“The good thing about how 
Mary has this whole system set up is, yes you do have a starter, but you always have an oppor-tunity to fight for a position,” 
Dagostino said on Wednesday. 
“So even though technically I am a starter right now, Abby and I will always be competing in the 
gym.”
While Detering — a lefty with 
a list of accolades that dates as 
far back as 2011 — waits for her chance to start or even to relieve 
Dagostino for a few rotations, 
for now she’ll be on the sidelines scouting the team – essentially taking on the same position Da-
gostino was in a year earlier, a 
position Dagostino said made her a more confident player.
“Last year, having Taylor and 
I consistently compete for a po-
sition it kind of built that con-
fidence with myself, that ‘hey I can do this even though, Tay-lor’s here right now,’” Dagostino 
said. “I know exactly what I have 
to do starting into next season.”VolleY , from page 13
