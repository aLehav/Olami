He disappeared underneath 
the pile of blankets. The man 
lay there motionless, camped 
out on Bo Diddley Community 
Plaza the night of Gainesville’s coldest air mass in years.  
Cris Salazar gently placed a 
navy blue bag filled with food at the foot of the man’s pile.
An hour before heading 
to the plaza, the 38-year-old Gainesville resident and his 
wife packed about 30 bags to 
give out, each filled with food to last two days. 
Freezing temperatures Mon-
day night revealed warm hearts in Gainesville as some residents braved the cold to hand out hot food and drinks to those in need.
“My spirit was moved to 
say go out tonight,” said Sala-zar, a member of Grace Fel-
lowship Ministry in northwest 
Gainesville.
He made his way around 
Bo Diddley Community Plaza, carrying several drawstring bags bulging with cans of Pro-
gresso soup, V8 juice, Nekot 
Cookies, water bottles and New Testament Bibles, among other items.
He and his wife carefully 
crafted each bag, taking into ac-count the USDA’s nutrient rec-
ommendations, Salazar said. 
Each bag contained roughly $6.50 worth of food, he said, and each one weighed about 25 
pounds.
As Salazar explained his ser-
vice, fellow Gainesville resident 
Betty Mason got out of her car, followed by her 8- and 9-year 
old sons.
Mason also brought snacks, 
including a hot water dispens-
er, hot chocolate packets, tea, 
peanut butter and bagels.
Salazar stopped to shake 
hands with her. The two had 
never met before, but Salazar said he felt it was fate the two 
were in the same place tonight: 
He brought dried soup, and she brought the hot water.
“God’s people work hand-
in-hand together,” he said.
The two sat down and be-
gan discussing life, family and the stigma some have when it comes to homeless people.
“Nothin’ different about 
me,” Mason told Salazar.
Then, a tall, skinny man in a 
blue hat and brown jacket ap-proached them.
“Where the bag?” he asked.“This one has your name on 
it,” Salazar said, as he handed him one.Locals team up to aid

The end of the Fall semester brought approval for a 
new degree within UF’s College of Design, Construc-
tion and Planning, as well as two canceled majors from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
Bernard Mair, associate provost for undergraduate 
affairs, said the new addition is a master’s in environ-mental analysis and design. The two canceled majors are the bachelor’s program for Asian studies and the master of arts in mathematics.
“With these low-enrollment majors, if there are no 
graduates within five years, we pretty much have to cancel the majors,” Mair said.
The Board of Governors monitors each major for graduation rates, and if the program doesn’t live up to the set benchmarks, it gets cut.
Mair said the last student who graduated with an 
M.A. in mathematics was in 2000, and only one stu-dent has graduated with a B.A. in Asian studies since 2011.
The relatively new international studies major that 
started in Fall 2011 in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences allows students to focus courses on America, Asia, the Caribbean or the Middle East. The program drew a large number of students away from Asian studies, effectively absorbing the major, said Mair.
During the series of budget cuts from 2006 to 2012, 
staff who retired or left UF weren’t replaced. Mair New environmental major approvedBEATRICE DUPUY

Lake Wauburg-bound stu-
dents no longer have to cram into 
friends’ cars for a weekend excur-sion thanks to a new bus route from the Regional Transit System. The newest RTS route to Lake 
Wauburg will begin on Jan. 18 and will shuttle students from the 
Reitz Union to the lake’s south en-
trance.
Buses will start running at 9:30 
a.m and will run every hour to the lake, with the last shuttle leav-ing from Lake 
Wauburg at 5 p.m.
The route 
will only run on 
Saturdays. 
The Florida-
Works office on 
Southwest 13th 
Street just past Williston Road will be the last stop before an express trip to Lake Wauburg. 
Students will need their Gator 
1 Cards to board the buses and to get  into the Wauburg entrance.
RTS spokesman Chip Skinner 
said at one time there was a bus that ran to Wauburg, but the bus was discontinued because of low ridership. 
“We had a lot of requests from 
the Student Body to bring that route back,” he said. 
Skinner added that not all bus-
ses are equipped with TransLoc equipment, so the new route may not show up on the app. 
Students like UF mathematics 
sophomore Anthony Delletiglie, 19, said the shuttle would make trips to Lake Wauburg more con-venient.RTS adds new shuttle route to Lake Wauburg

SUNNY ISLES BEACH, Fla.— 
A new condo tower on Sunny 
Isles Beach will include a sculp-ture by artist Helidon Xhixha in each unit.
The Miami Herald reports the 
tower named Muse will feature a 47-story, 68-unit tower built on a less than 1-acre site along Collins Avenue. It is expected to break ground in June.
“He’s going to do art in ev-
ery apartment and around the grounds and lobby,” said Kevin 
Maloney, founder and CEO of 
New York-based Property Mar-kets Group, which is launching the tower with co-developer S2 Development of Aventura.
The Albanian-born artist will 
consult with unit buyers and de-sign a piece for each, Maloney said.
The Herald said the 694-foot-
tall building will match the height of two other Sunny Isles Beach luxury projects — the Porsche Design Tower and Mansions at Acqualina. It will reach the maxi-
mum height allowed in the area 
by the Federal Aviation Adminis-tration.
Maloney said the building will 
be just 60 feet wide, facing the ocean. It will feature residences starting at 2,360 square feet and will include two full-ﬂ  oor pent-houses with more than 5,800 
square feet.
“From a staging point of view, 
it’s going to be difﬁ  cult to put up: 
a tall, narrow building with a twist and cantilevers,” said Maloney, who tends to build tall, thin build-ings. He has also announced plans for a building on West 57th Street in New York.
Most ﬂ  oors in the Sunny Isles 
building will have two units with a thick core between them.
“When you go high, you end 
up with a thick core, with heavy shear walls to support the build-ing,” Maloney said.
Muse will start taking reserva-
tions soon.S. Fla. condo will sport

Starting Jan. 1, minimum wage 
workers receive $7.93 per hour, a 
14-cent increase from last year, 
according to the Florida Depart-
ment of Economic Opportunity.
Although the change is in line 
with a Florida law passed in 2004 
that requires minimum wage to 
adjust yearly to the cost of liv-ing, some people don’t think this year’s change will make that big of a difference.
Employee rights’ activist and 
UF alumnus Jeremiah Tattersall, 27, said it’s hard to call the new minimum wage an increase at all.
Fourteen more cents an hour 
would equal about $290 more a year for the average minimum-wage worker, said Tattersall, who works to implement programs 
and lobby politicians in support 
of pro-labor legislation for the North Central Florida Central La-bor Council. 
Tattersall said the increase will 
help minimum-wage workers in the short run, but their purchas-ing power is essentially the same.
“So it’s really not an extra $290 
a year,” Tattersall said. “Food costs more. Electricity costs more.”
If the minimum wage had in-
creased along inﬂ  ationary lines, he said, it would be about $20 by now.
Charlesynquette Duncan, a 19-
year-old UF psychology senior, earns minimum wage working at UF’s Southwest Recreation Cen-ter. 
Duncan said the increase will 
not make a big difference, but she appreciates the extra cash.
“It’s about $4 more per pay-
check,” Duncan said. “More mon-
ey’s always better.”
UF sophomore Lauren Beadle, 
19, shares the same view as Dun-
can.
The biology and history ma-
jor works at a zip line company called Treetop Trek in Melbourne over school breaks and occasional weekends.
She uses most of the money she 
earns to pay for her car, she said, and her parents help support her school and living expenses. 
However, some of Beadle’s co-
workers rely on their paychecks as their main source of income, and many of them use govern-
ment-funded ﬁ  nancial aid to pay 
the bills.
Even though the wage chang-
es with living costs, Tattersall said 
he believes the increase still isn’t 
enough for workers to support themselves without depending on government aid.
“It’s better than nothing, but 
it doesn’t advance the working people,” he said.

would enjoy going to Lake Wauburg,” he said. 
“It’s nice for them to have the opportunity to ride the bus there.”
RTS and UF had been discussing the possi-
bility of a new route since early 2013, Skinner said. 
Scott Fox, director of Transportation and 
Parking Services at UF, said the idea for the route was discussed with RTS at a committee meeting on transportation access fees.
“They came up with the recommendation to 
restore bus service to Lake Wauburg, and they were able to do that without raising transporta-
tion access fees,” Fox said.
Skinner estimated that the new route, run-
ning until June 28, will cost UF about $10,000.
Kate Heffernan, a 20-year-old UF politi-
cal science and natural resource conservation 
junior, said if she lived on campus now, she would take advantage of the bus route.
“My freshman year, I didn’t have a car, and 
I knew Lake Wauburg was there,” said Heffer-
nan. “But I couldn’t access it on my own.”
RTS also added Route 77 to its 2014 sched-
ule. The route runs from Sante Fe College to 
Cabana Beach Apartments, near I-75.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 2014

A local woman was arrested 
Monday evening after police 
reported she pulled a gun on her girlfriend.
Gainesville Police arrested 
24-year-old Taljah Chanite Lang on aggravated battery and firearm possession charges, according to an arrest report. 
At about 7 p.m., Lang 
and her girlfriend, Kelsey Camielle Gaddy, began fighting in the 700 block of Southeast Third Street near the Rosa Parks bus station, according to the report. 
During the fight, Lang 
pulled a handgun out of her backpack and pushed it against Gaddy’s head, according to the report. Gaddy then dropped Lang off at the bus station. She told the staff that Lang was in possession of a gun and called 911.
Employees pointed out 
Lang to officers who arrived at the station, according to the report. Police found the gun in Lang’s backpack and ammunition matching the gun’s caliber. 
The gun’s serial number 
was unreadable. 
Officers booked Lang 
into the Alachua County Jail at about 8 p.m., where she remained as of press time in lieu of a $60,000 bond. Local woman pulls

MIAMI — Carnival Corp. said Tuesday 
that the former CEO of Costa Cruises, the 
company behind the Concordia disaster, is 
retiring.Costa owns the Concordia cruise ship 
that capsized off the central Italian coast 
in early 2012. Pier Luigi Foschi was CEO 
at Costa Cruises when the Concordia 
slammed into a reef off the Tuscan island of Giglio with more than 4,000 people on board. Thirty-two people died.
Carnival said Tuesday 
that Foschi, 67, is retiring after 16 years with the 
company. Foschi retired 
as Costa Cruises CEO six 
months after the Concor-dia disaster. Parent com-
pany Carnival later named him head of its business in Asia.
Carnival said in a regulatory filing Tues-
day that Foschi stopped working for the company in November and retired from its board Monday. He is getting a payment 
of 1.25 million euros ($1.7 million) as part 
of a separation agreement.
Carnival Chairman Micky Arison said 
in a statement Tuesday that Foschi’s ef-
forts helped transform the company.Carnival cruise corp. says former Costa Cruises CEO retiring

Soon, Salazar was on his way again, 
handing out more bags around Bo

called after him.
“Church man! Hey sir!” he shouted, 
heading toward Salazar for a bag, “I ain’t

Mason smiled, and after he left, her 
9-year-old said, “I hope that guy got it.”
Mason brought about $30 worth of 
food to the plaza with her two sons. It wasn’t her first time helping out on the 
plaza, but Mason said she thought people 
needed a little something extra tonight.“I just thought it was gonna be super 
cold, so I wanted to bring something 
warm,” she said.
Mason said she’s always wanted to 
help the homeless from an early age, and 
now she has the chance.
“It’s funny: People always tell you not 
to do things like this because it’s danger-
ous,” she said. “I found it to be the oppo-site.”
After everyone left, Calvin Taylor 
stood on the plaza, getting ready to head to St. Francis House for a warm place to stay the night. The 58-year-old missed the hot chocolate and the bags of food, but he said he’s gotten items from Gainesville 
residents before on cold nights like this.
“I can’t complain because it’s free,” 
Taylor said.
As for chilly weather, Taylor said he’s 
lived in Gainesville on and off for 30 years 
and can handle the cold because he’s from South Carolina.

said the loss of faculty was felt more in smaller programs like 
Asian studies, where student enrollment was already mini-mal.
“Faculty naturally looked for greener pastures if they 
could,” he said. “Their talents will be better used for teaching a larger number of students.”
There is still a minor for Asian studies, and Mair said the 
similarities between the master of science and master of arts in mathematics made the M.A. redundant.
Christopher Silver, the dean of the College of Design, 
Construction and Planning, said the one-year environmental analysis and design program appeals to students looking for a supplemental master’s degree that teaches hands-on ana-lytical skills.
He said preparations are still being made, and it’s expected 
to be available starting Summer or Fall 2014.
While other majors in the college might learn how to con-
struct a road, environmental design considers factors like an area’s community and infrastructure. 
The program also includes experience with geographic in-
formation systems, which is an asset to students searching for a career in planning and development.
“Someone with this degree can get hired by pretty much 
any development company,” Silver said.MAjoRS , from page 1Foschi

VOLUNTEER FOR MLK DAY.

The ﬁ  rst Spring Student Senate 
meeting on Tuesday night kicked off 
the semester with an announcement that the resolution condemning the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions 
Movement had been temporarily 
removed from the agenda, a unani-mously passed bill and Senate plans for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  
The resolution condemning the 
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, which was hotly de-bated and tabled at Fall’s ﬁ  nal Sen-ate meeting, was removed from the 
agenda by the authors.
According to the Palestinian BDS 
National Committee’s website, the 
movement calls for the end of all ﬁ  -nancial partnerships with Israel be-cause of the nation’s human rights violations against Palestinians.
Elliot Grasso, president pro-
tempore, said if the authors had not 
removed the legislation, the Senate 
would have discussed the bill as planned.
“The authors of that bill sent an 
email out over the Listserv remov-ing that piece of legislation from the agenda,” he said. “Normally, if the bill was tabled, it would just go back on the agenda. However, because the authors volunteered to remove it, it was not back on the agenda.”
Sydney Kaplan, an author of the 
bill and Chomp the Vote executive director, wrote an email to the sena-tors explaining the reason for the re-moval of the legislation.She wrote that before the bill is 
brought back to Senate, the authors would “like to invest more time in 
educating all senators and Univer-
sity of Florida students about the is-sues affecting the state of Israel and potential ramiﬁ  cations within the U.S.”
A resolution authored by about 
12 senators supporting the Inter-Residence Hall Association’s ex-pansion of printing within dorms 
passed unanimously.
Sen. Michael Christ, minority 
leader and one of the bill’s authors, 
said the senators felt that expand-ing printing in the residence halls is beneﬁ  cial.
“We recognize that the Reitz 
Union may not be the most conve-nient space for students to travel,” 
he said. “For example, we mapped 
it out on Google Maps, and it was up to 20 minutes away for students to walk to print there.”
The resolution commends 
IRHA’s recent expansion of printing services to Broward Hall and to the Murphree Area, which allows print-ing access for an additional 1,687 
students.
Additionally, plans for the Sen-
ate to participate in the Martin Lu-
ther King Day of Service on Jan. 20 were announced. Senators who at-tend will volunteer in community projects throughout Gainesville.WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

� VICTIMS LOST $8 MILLION.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
STUART, Fla. — Two people 
have been charged in Florida with 
operating a rental property scheme 
in three counties that defrauded at 
least 50 victims.
Florida Department of Law En-
forcement ofﬁ  cials said Monday 
the scam involved 35 properties in 
Martin, Palm Beach and Broward counties. 
Authorities say 50-year-old Rob-
ert Allen Tribble Jr. of Jupiter used false paperwork to obtain control of properties in foreclosure and then rented or leased them to unsuspect-ing people.
The FDLE says victims lost some 
$8 million in the scheme.
Tribble is facing fraud, money 
laundering, obstruction of justice 
and criminal use of personal iden-
tiﬁ  cation charges. 
An alleged accomplice, 45-year-
old Mary Revoller-Chavez, is facing similar charges. Both were jailed in Martin County.

Drop/add week woes
Like taxes, gynecological exams and salad, drop/add 
week is a necessary evil — a time of the semester where 
classes are treated like sample stations at Costco, only 
instead of hairnet-wearing old ladies, professors and TAs are 
doling out the tastes of what the semester will bring.
Sometimes the tastes are promising, like a chicken wing 
or fancy cheese: The professor may be witty, the class may have a convenient location, or the readings may look fascinat-
ing. However, sometimes, the tastes may leave a bad taste in 
your mouth: The grad-student instructor may be stiff or tim-id, your classmates may have unbearable BO, or your course 
location could be located on the outskirts of campus, far from 
a Starbucks or bus stop.
But no matter what, it seems that Murphy’s law has its 
own speciﬁ  c application to drop/add week, and anything that can go wrong is guaranteed to go wrong. The cutie you were eyeing on the ﬁ  rst day will probably vanish by the time 
drop/add is up, the class you desperately need for your ma-
jor inevitably ﬁ  lls instantly, and the 7:20 a.m. Monday class instructor allows only one absence.
The “taste” you experience during the ﬁ  rst few days of 
class may be misleading as well. Write off a course too quick-ly and you may lose out on a great opportunity in disguise. 
Tentatively stick around and you may be forced to eventually 
withdraw — and fork over hundreds of bucks back to Bright Futures.
So to you, reader, we offer our best drop/add week advice 
to remember while you’re waiting in advising-ofﬁ  ce lines and trying not to roll your eyes at an overenthusiastic instructor’s 
cheesy jokes: Keep an open mind, but don’t be too proud to 
switch out of a class that clearly won’t serve you in the long term. You, your family, the state and other scholarship orga-
nizations are investing hard-earned dollars into your educa-
tion and future success, so don’t waste those dollars by stay-ing in a class that could damage your GPA or your sanity.
The beginnings of semesters usher varying levels of anxi-
ety for different students, from freshmen trying to ﬁ  nd their way to seniors worrying about what life after graduation will 
have to offer. Remember, during this trying time, the student 
rec centers, the UF Counseling & Wellness Center, the inﬁ  r-mary and the many advising ofﬁ  ces are here for your use. 
Exercising, a session with a counselor, a ﬂ  u shot and some 
much-needed guidance will help you plow through these un-certain times with ease.
In the meantime, try not to do anything too reckless. Is it 
really worth it to take a course with your new boyfriend or girlfriend? Will you gain anything from a night of marathon 
ﬂ  ip cup the night before a morning class? Do you really want 
to explain a compulsive tattoo/piercing/drastic haircut to your parents — or boss?
Probably not.

America’s problem is lack of social mobility
Another semester brought me another opportunity 
to contribute to the Alligator Opinions section. As I sat down and faced my laptop, preparing to write 
my ﬁ  rst piece of the new year, I thought I should tackle the beneﬁ  ts of reading or my collegiate career so far. I wanted 
to stay away from politics at least for one week — we all 
want to start the semester on a good note.
Unfortunately, I just could not stay away from politics. 
Instead of a ﬂ  uff piece, I decided to write an article that deals with a problem that grips the nation: economic in-equality.
Inequality is a word that is thrown around by many 
politicians. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio made econom-ic inequality the central theme of his inauguration last 
week. President  Barack Obama promised the American 
people the focus of his next three years in ofﬁ  ce would be battling economic inequality. Their use of the word di-rectly insinuates the rich grabbing more and more wealth from Americans with lower incomes. But this usage is a bit misleading. You cannot look at the American economy as a pie chart.  
Before we dive further into this debate, let’s break 
down this issue. I would contest most people are OK with 
general economic inequality. To illustrate my point, pic-
ture Businessman A and Businessman B. 
Businessman A works hard at his job and is an efﬁ  cient 
worker. Businessman B is lazy and not a good worker. As a result, Businessman A gets paid more than Businessman B. Most people are OK with this inequality because one worker succeeds because of his hard work.  
The larger issue is social mobility. In this example, 
Businessmen A and B both work hard and are produc-
tive and efﬁ  cient workers, but neither of them can climb 
the economic ladder. Social mobility is not an issue of rich versus poor. It is an issue of whether the hard workers of the country can achieve economic success by virtue of the American values of determination, drive and hard work.
In our economy, social mobility seems out of reach 
for most recession-hit, middle-class Americans. The top income earners remain unaffected by the bad economy while those below them cannot say the same.
The way to ﬁ  x social mobility 
is to make it easier for middle-class Americans to climb up the 
economic ladder. How does one 
do this?
First, don’t do what de Blasio 
and Obama have proposed. Both argue for increased government 
action by way of more taxes, increased welfare, increased minimum wage and more regulation. There are a few ﬂ  aws in this approach; you cannot simply legislate your way into prosperity. President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to 
legislate America into prosperity with the Great Society, 
but it is a tried-and-failed concept of the left.
Second, make it easier for small businesses to thrive. 
Deregulation is the way to go. One can make the case for tort reform in this same vein. The big businesses can af-ford top-tier lawyers to navigate the complex legal sys-tem. Give the little guy the ability to become one of the big guys. Small businesses make up the backbone of our economy and should have the ability to grow and prosper 
without complex regulations.
Third, reduce the cost of education. Studies show that 
college graduates earn higher incomes than non-college 
graduates. That being said, crippling debt from people’s college years discourages them from buying and consum-ing goods, which is not good for the larger economy. 
The American dream is based upon the notion that 
with hard work and determination, the fruits of your labor will lead to economic success. In this economy, many ﬁ  nd 
it hard to climb the economic ladder. Optimistically, we 
can hang our hats on the fact that we are Americans, and Americans, after all, ﬁ  nd a way to solve the problems they face. We should not pit the “haves” against the “have-nots.” We should advocate that the “have-nots” are the “soon-to-haves.”

An epidemic is spreading through the United 
States. Signs of infection include loss of con-centration, an unwillingness to contribute to 
personal learning and a heightened sense of feeling lost and alone.
This disease: burnout in 
education. It is caused by the constant strain students feel to perform at their best, go to the best school and find the best career. Ac-cording to the Council for Aid to Education, almost half of public college students do not graduate.
This is a symptom of burnout.
Employers are also looking for people who have 
a degree and something more. The U.S. Department 
of Labor counts the unemployment rate at 7.3 per-cent, deducing that higher education is no longer enough. They concluded that a resume with depth and diversity is a crucial addition.
How can we cure this? How can we set ourselves 
above the rest? The only known antidote is called “the gap year.” 
Affluent voices everywhere are urging for a gap 
year: Harvard College’s dean of admissions encour-ages taking a gap year to find passion and to find the “something more.”
This something more can be gained through 
volunteering, interning or working in new environ-ments — exactly what is done in a gap year. A gap year helps students graduate, build resumes and save money.
Katie Palermo, a gap-year success story and Cali-
fornia State University graduate, found passion in international relations after an eye-opening year. She gained this passion while volunteering around the world, which gave her reason to return to the classroom and graduate.
Without the gap year, Palermo could have eas-
ily joined the 42 percent of students who don’t find their passion and don’t graduate. A gap year is a 
step toward passion — a step toward graduation.
“The Complete Guide to the Gap Year” offers 94 
different opportunities, programs and organizations 
to help students become culturally immersed and gain internship opportunities and new skills. This is merely one resource exemplifying the opportunities of a gap year. It is a step toward depth and diversity — a step toward a competitive resume.
Critics of a gap year feel pushing through burn-
out is more cost effective, reasoning that money spent on a gap year takes away from money spent on tuition. 
However, many gap year programs cost nothing 
and provide housing and a monthly stipend. For ex-ample, City Year provides a monthly stipend while students volunteer as mentors to at-risk youth. 
In addition, City Year gives a grant to be used for 
higher education upon completion of the program. 
This is only one example of the ways in which a gap 
year can be cost effective. A gap year is a step to-ward efficiency — a step toward saving money.
Burnout is no laughing matter, and this disease 
is spreading like “senioritis” did all those years ago. We must encourage students to take at least one dose of the gap year; otherwise, it will be too late for this generation and definitely the next. 
The United States needs to accept burnout as an 
epidemic. We all need to understand that higher education is not enough. 
A gap year means graduation. A gap year means 
a career. A gap year means money saved. A gap year means a happy life. 
Talk to your parents. Tell the youth. Influence 
your peers, tell them: “We need the gap year.”

UWire“GET BANKSY!” the front page of the New York Post de-
clared, announcing that the New York Police Department had commenced a hunt for the vandal. Though the reports 
of the manhunt for the famed graffiti artist were debunked by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the headline offers a telling portrait 
of the tension between street art’s status as an act of vandalism 
and as a democratic art form. A champion of the broken win-dows theory, Bloomberg criticized Banksy’s presence in New York, saying in a news conference that graffiti is “not my defini-tion of art,” and is “a sign of decay and lost control.”
In spite of Bloomberg’s remarks on the artistry of graffiti — 
or lack thereof — the general public seems to disagree: Banksy enjoys a reputation as one of the most successful contemporary street artists. The unparalleled accessibility of the medium has 
driven the rising democratization of art: Artists ranging from 
Banksy to Mark Jenkins are eschewing museums in favor of the streets.
Indeed, at its heart, street art challenges the notion of control 
and authority. As a medium, the genre deconstructs the con-fines of high art, choosing instead to occupy a space that creates a physical division between the art itself and the institutions it critiques. And from the contrarian underpinnings of the art style emerges a genre rife with sociopolitical commentary.
Banksy’s recent residency in New York, titled “Better Out 
Than In,” typifies street art’s growing appeal to the general pop-ulation — an appeal that has emerged as a consequence of the genre’s commitment to increasing the visibility of art. On his web-site, Banksy cheekily appropriates Paul Cézanne’s statement that “all pictures painted inside, in the studio, will never be as good as those done outside.” For street artists, outside is more than  
 a physical realm: Outside is the realm of accessibility, a space where the topics broached by street art can be freely discussed. 
Maurice Magaña, a visiting scholar at the Institute of Ameri-
can Cultures who studied political street art in Mexico, noted that the genre has facilitated greater participation in political discourse. 
“You don’t have to be a political or social elite to produce 
street art. You don’t have the same type of gatekeeping that you have with other types of art,” Magaña explained. And the de-mocratization of discourse extends beyond the production of art. “The scope of the people who are going to encounter (the 
work) is exponentially greater when it’s done in a public space,” 
Magaña added. 
The genre’s popular appeal resides in its unique ability to deliver social and political criticism.
In a conversation with the Harvard Political Review, Lau-
rence Ralph, professor of African-American studies and anthro-pology at Harvard University, explained that the street art of to-day is an extension of graffiti art. Its heavily politicized content 
is a direct consequence of graffiti’s status as “a product from 
people in marginalized positions who have tried to express themselves and find a voice. Like rap music, street art retains its political context … graffiti is not necessarily political, but it will always have the potential to be.”
Paradoxically, the popular, accessible appeal that character-
izes the genre has ushered street art into precisely the same con-sumerist culture it attempts to critique. Banksy’s installations, including a smashed cinder block reinterpretation of Egypt’s 
Great Sphinx, have been hauled off to be sold on lucrative art 
markets. 
More damningly, major corporations like Nike Inc. are in-
creasingly turning to artists like Eric Haze (also known as SE3) to produce branding and marketing campaigns. And Shepard Fairey, famed creator of Barack Obama’s “HOPE” poster, founded the commercially successful clothing line OBEY based on his art. In a bizarre twist of fate, these artists have financially capitalized on their work, pairing with corporations despite the 
genre’s traditionally anti-corporate stance.
Perhaps the rising popularity of street art suggests its induc-
tion into the popular canon. Even if the current iteration of high-
profile graffiti loses its subversive edge, the medium itself and the criticism it offers will likely remain relevant for decades to come.
Stylistically, the genre has evolved and will continue to 
evolve as an art form, but its cultural significance as a medium for marginalized voices and its unique ability to interact with 
the general public will likely remain constant.
Currently, the street art scene is dominated by Banksy and 
his contemporaries, but change is forthcoming. In part, this is 
inevitable — as a medium, graffiti art is inherently dynamic and highly responsive to the physical and political contexts it emerges from. 
The commercial success of contemporary street artists sug-
gests that, as Banksy moves from the streets to Sotheby’s, new artists, new styles and new voices of dissent will emerge to 
populate the space.

On the front page of Chipotle’s website, 
a photo of a familiar foil-wrapped burrito is 
emblazoned with the words, “Responsibly raised.”
But over Winter Break, the restaurant’s 
Gainesville locations hung signs on the Plexi-glas where patrons order, emblazoned with the words, “FYI,” followed by a brief notice.
Both locations — one on West University 
Avenue and the other on Southwest Archer Road — are not serving the “responsibly raised” steak Chipotle typically sells because of a shortage. 
For the next few weeks, Chipotle spokes-
man Chris Arnold said, only “conventionally raised” sources of steak will be served locally in dishes like the company’s staple burritos and burrito bowls. 
“It’s our preference to serve only meat 
from animals that are raised in a humane way and without the use of antibiotics or added hormones, and we do more of that than any-one,” Arnold said. “But the availability of beef raised to this higher standard is proving to be a challenge at the moment and has been for several months now.” 
Last year, similar signs were hung in other 
areas of the country for a brief period of time, usually for a few weeks, Arnold said. This is the first time Gainesville stores have experi-enced the effects of the shortage. 
He apologized to patrons for the switch on 
the steak and barbacoa steak option, calling the situation “difficult.”
“Because beef cattle are raised to 30-36 
months, it’s very difficult to impact upon the available supply quickly,” Arnold said.
Other menu options such as chicken and 
carnitas are not affected. 
Juby Mammen, the service manager at the 
University Avenue location and a 22-year-old UF biology senior, said he doesn’t think the switch has affected business. 
UF telecommunication freshman Allie 
Mangan, 18, said the switch didn’t affect her 
dinner.
“I think it’s good they said something,” 
Mangan said while eating a steak burrito 
bowl, “but I didn’t even notice.”

Students can make their workouts worth more this Thursday.
The Swamp’s Largest Zumba Fitness Fest, hosted by a partner-
ship between Dance Marathon at UF and the UF Department of Recreational Sports, will be held Thursday at the Southwest Recre-ation Center from 7 to 8:30 p.m.
Participants are asked to make a $5 donation for the UF Health 
Shands Children’s Hospital.
Carlos Gordian, internal communications overall director for 
Dance Marathon at UF, said he is hoping for a big turnout at this new event.
“We don’t have a set goal,” said Gordian, a 22-year-old UF ma-
terials science and engineering  senior. “We’re just excited to see how many people show up and support this great cause.”
During the event, two Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals 
families will share their stories.
Catherine Klein, a 22-year-old UF psychology senior, said see-
ing the families is a great reminder of why students should partici-pate in Dance Marathon events.
“It keeps spirits high, and everyone remembers why they’re 
raising money,” Klein said. “It makes the experience of being there more powerful.”
Two Zumba instructors will be giving the hourlong class. 
Molly Vazquez, public relations overall director for Dance Mar-
athon at UF, said having families share their stories made the event 
more meaningful, and she hopes to see the event grow each year.

JACKSONVILLE — Wildlife 
advocates want endangered spe-
cies protections extended to a 2-inch crustacean found only in one county in Florida’s Panhan-
dle.
The Center for Biological Di-
versity said Monday that it had 
filed a petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service seeking pro-tection for the wingtail crayfish.
The crayfish is found only 
in Gulf County, in seasonally flooded freshwater areas in the flatwoods west and south of We-wahitchka.
A scientist at the center says the 
crayfish’s wetlands habitat is im-
portant for flood prevention and 
water purification. Tierra Curry says the crayfish is threatened by development, water pollution and the effects of climate change.
Crayfish also are called craw-
dads, crawfish, mudbugs, crawly bottoms and river lobsters. Scien-tists say they’re important to the 
ecosystem because the burrows 
they dig create shelter for other animals.Endangered status

Almost half of black men are 
arrested during their teen and 
young adult years. 
Data from a study released 
Monday in the journal Crime & 
Delinquency reports that about 49 
percent of black men and roughly 38 percent of white men are ar-rested by the age of 23.
The study looked at data from 
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth between 1997 and 2008, during which survey takers re-ported their own arrests.
According to the study, some 
of the most significant findings show that men are arrested more often than women. 
Race also plays a significant 
factor in the probability of arrests for men but not so for women, ac-cording to the data.
Robert Brame, an author of the 
study, said researchers are work-ing to provide a more thorough look at the data by finding out how often arrests turn to convic-tions and which offenses men in 
this age group are committing. 
They’re also looking at data on subsequent offenses among peo-ple arrested in the past, he said.
“All we’re doing in this study 
is reporting the arrest experiences people have,” said Brame, a crimi-nology professor at the University of South Carolina.
The data documented every-
thing other than minor traffic of-fenses, he said. 
Most of the arrests were not for 
serious offenses. 
However, Brame said people 
are still concerned about the data because the age group is so young.“That’s a concern we have, that 
these high arrest rates are poten-tially creating difficult issues as 
people make the transition from 
adolescence to adulthood in the United States,” Brame said.
As for the uneven risk of arrest 
across races, Brame said the find-ings are “certainly consistent with everything we know about the criminal justice system.”
In Gainesville, law enforce-
ment has already started looking into possible issues that could contribute to young and minority arrests.
Gainesville Police began ef-
forts to study minorities in the ju-venile justice system when it was awarded a Disproportionate Mi-nority Contact grant in 2012 from the Center for Children’s Law and 
Policy, said GPD spokesman Offi-
cer Ben Tobias.
“We saw that there was a po-
tential problem, so we decided to apply for a grant to study it,” he said.Study finds youth arrest statistics high“We don’t have a set goal. . . We’re just excited

Alachua County library goers 
now have access to millions of songs 
with their library cards.
The county’s library district 
launched a new service Monday 
that allows cardholders to down-
load popular songs and music vid-eos for free.
The program, called Freegal 
Music, gives registered library card holders access to more than 7 mil-lion songs and videos, including the majority of Sony Music’s catalogue.
To use the service, card holders 
can either download the mobile app on their smartphones or save the files directly to their computers, ac-cording to a news release. Access al-lows users to download three songs or one music video per week.
Library Ideas, an international 
company that provides libraries with digital access to innovative 
products and services, runs the ser-
vice, according to the release.
Nickie Kortus, marketing and 
public relations manager for Alach-
ua County Library District, said the 
program will draw more patrons to Alachua County libraries.
Staff leaders of the district began 
negotiations with Library Ideas in September to obtain and launch the service this month.
“We’ve been aware of the prod-
uct for a while,” Kortus said. “It’s 
determining whether a service can 
be budgeted that takes time.”
After realizing that library pa-
trons would be interested in Freegal Music, officials approved purchas-ing the service. 
“We’re looking forward to bring-
ing a new type of material to users who may or may not actually step 
into a library,” Kortus said.
During the first day of access, 
more than 70 Alachua County Li-
brary card holders downloaded about 200 songs.
Kortus also said the district will 
consider tabling on campus at UF this month to inform students about Freegal and other services the pub-
lic libraries provide, which she said 
complement the academic resources offered by campus libraries.
Marissa Labadie, a UF journal-
ism junior, said students and other Alachua County residents should take advantage of the service, al-though she considers herself unaf-fected by it.
Labadie, 20, has a library card 
through the Miami-Dade Public Li-brary System, which gained access to Freegal in January 2013.
“Most of my friends don’t have 
library cards at all,” Labadie said. “They read everything online. I’m more traditional. I actually like checking out books.”Steven Evens, 20, is a reader 
and lover of books, like Labadie. But Evens, a UF economics junior, said he doesn’t think students will be interested in Freegal Music, es-pecially when they can download songs from other places or use mu-sic streaming programs like Spotify and Pandora.
“I think if students really wanted 
a specific song, they would illegally download it,” Evens said.

STARKE — A Florida inmate 
was executed Tuesday for fatally 
stabbing a prison guard with a 
sharpened spoon while on death 
row for abducting and killing a Miami couple.
Askari Abdullah Muhammad, 
previously known as Thomas Knight, was pronounced dead at 6:45 p.m. Tuesday after a lethal injection at Florida State Prison, the governor’s office said. The 
execution took place in the same 
prison where Muhammad killed corrections officer Richard Burke in 1980.
“This is where my dad took his 
last breath,” said the slain guard’s daughter, 47-year-old Carolyn Burke Thompson. She was among several family members who wit-

worked,” she said. “I am at peace knowing I don’t have to wait any 
longer. I miss my dad a lot.”
Muhammad, 62, was initially 
condemned to die for the 1974 
abduction and killings of Sydney and Lillian Gans, of Miami. Tues-day’s execution was specifically for Burke’s killing.

Gainesville Police arrested two brothers early Tuesday 
after police reported they fought local bar patrons and em-
ployees.
Officers arrested 25-year-old Corderyl J. Monroe and 
36-year-old James Monroe on battery charges, according to an arrest report.
At about 1 a.m., the brothers began fighting with pa-
trons of Gator City, at 1728 W. University Ave., according to the report. 
Bar employees interfered and successfully ousted James 
Monroe from the bar.
However, when an employee tried to remove the other 
Monroe brother, he punched back, according to the report. 
Eventually, the security staff ejected the second brother, 
but the pair returned to continue fighting the employees outside the bar, according to the report. 
During the struggle, Corderyl Monroe bit employees 
and pulled out a small pocket knife, which one of the em-ployees managed to take from him before law enforcement arrived.
During questioning, Corderyl Monroe said he didn’t in-
tentionally pull out the knife and that it must’ve fallen out of his pocket. 
Officers booked the brothers into jail at about 2:30 a.m. 
James Monroe was released at about 2:30 p.m. after meet-ing bond. 
Corderyl Monroe remains in lieu of a $65,000 bond be-
cause of additional aggravated and felony battery charges.Brothers arrested

Former Gator resigns
Former UF quarterback Shane Matthews resigned from his position as 
head coach of Ponte Vedra Beach Nease High School. He was 9-11 in two seasons at the school. Matthews played at UF from 1990-1992.Twelve former Gators have seen playing time in the NBA this season. Catch up with them on page 14. Florida ranked highly

When No. 10 Florida (11-2) 
opens its Southeastern Confer-
ence schedule against South 
Carolina (7-6) tonight at 7 in the 
O’Connell Center, the Game-cocks will see a different Patric Young than they did nearly one year ago. 
In fact, they will see about 10 
pounds of difference.
The 6-foot-9 center dropped 
from 250 pounds to 240 during the offseason in order to increase his quickness and agility on the floor. 
Coach Billy Donovan said los-ing the weight along with gain-ing more mobility has helped the senior enjoy his best season of his career.
“I think he’s in better condi-
tion; he’s running the floor bet-ter, and he’s chasing balls bet-ter,” Donovan said.

Bridgette Caquatto is not the most 
experienced member on the Florida 
gymnastics squad. But as the Naper-
ville, Ill., native prepares to start her 
sophomore season, she feels like she has already been tested. 
Caquatto under-
went two operations and battled stress re-actions in her shins  but still managed to compete in seven 
combined regular-
season uneven bars and floor events — 
five of which were exhibitions — last year, starting in late January 2013. She 
missed UF’s first three meets of last 
season due to injury and did not com-pete in four others.
“It kind of makes your heart hurt a 
little bit when they’re out there compet-
ing,” Caquatto said. “I wish I was more 
healthy last season, but I did rehab all last year.” 
Added coach Rhonda Faehn: “I felt so bad for her last year … she really wasn’t even cleared to start doing gym-nastics until after Thanksgiving.”
Despite her injuries, Caquatto con-
tributed to the team’s national champi-onship run when she recorded a career best of 9.95 on floor at the NCAA semi-finals in Los Angeles.
“I know I wasn’t in my top shape,” 
Caquatto said. “I feel a lot better this year. I remember last year I struggled a little bit just because it really takes a toll on your body when you get recon-
structive surgery and whatnot.” 
Even though her back-to-back knee 
and shoulder surgeries were the first 
she underwent as a result of gymnas-
tics, Caquatto said she never even en-
tertained the idea of quitting the sport or giving up on collegiate gymnastics, opting to avoid surgery when pos-
sible.
“I would always take the option 
if I could just rest and rehab and let it 
heal,” she said. “Once they go in there, there’s no turning back.”

Mike Holloway is one of the 
most decorated coaches Florida 
has on its payroll. Under his 
leadership, the UF men’s team 
has won five national titles, and Holloway has five coach of the year awards.
Now, he is focused on bring-
ing the women up to the men’s level of success. 
“This is my 19th year here, 
and this may be the best fall 
we’ve ever had,” Holloway 
said. 
“We’ve been putting a lot of 
time and effort to getting the 
women’s program in the same 
position that the men are cur-rently at this time.”
Holloway said the women’s 
team will rely on the senior leadership of Cory McGee and Agata Strausa in distance 
events.

way during the fall cross coun-try season. UF women look to meet

During the Golden State Warriors’ 10-game win-
ning streak, power forward David Lee has been on 
a tear. 
Lee, who played at UF in 2001-05, has averaged 
22.6 points on 61.4 percent shooting and 10.4 re-
bounds in his past 10 games. Throughout the span, 
the 6-foot-9, 240-pound power forward has record-ed six point-rebound double-doubles.
In the Warriors’ 101-80 win against the Milwau-
kee Bucks on Tuesday night, Lee scored 22 points and grabbed a game-high 18 rebounds.
For his play from the week of Dec. 30 to Jan. 5, 
Lee was named the NBA’s Western Conference Player of the Week. 
As of Jan. 7, Lee ranks 24th in the league in scor-
ing with 19 points per game and 11th in rebounding with 9.8 per contest. With Lee surging, the Warriors are 24-13 and remain in the Western Conference playoff hunt. 
Beal working his way back: A stress injury in 
Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal’s right leg has become a roadblock in his quest for an All-Star bid. 
Prior to missing nine games with the injury, Beal 
led the Wizards in scoring with 20.6 points per game in a league-high 40.2 minutes per contest. But since 
returning on Dec. 16, 2013, Beal has played with 
hesitancy in 10 games and seen his minutes limited, averaging only 13.9 points on 41.6 shooting in 27.6 minutes.
But in the Wizards’ 97-83 win over the Charlotte 
Bobcats on Tuesday, Beal came up big, shooting 10 of 18 from the ﬁ  eld for 21 points. He also notched three assists and did not turn over the ball.
Hawks struggling without Horford: The 18-17 
Atlanta Hawks have been on a slide since losing center Al Horford for the season to a torn right pec-toral muscle.
The team is 2-4 since he suffered the injury on 
Dec. 26, 2013, and has seen its grasp on the third spot in the Eastern Conference weaken. 
Before suffering the injury, Horford was having 
one of the best seasons of his career. He led the team in scoring with 18.6 points per game on the sev-enth-best ﬁ  eld-goal percentage (.567) in the league. He also averaged 8.4 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.5 blocks in 33 starts.14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 2014
Gators in the NBA: Lee leading Warriors during winning streakLOGAN MCGUIRE

The Southeastern Conference named three UF athletes 
SEC Swimmers of the Week following Florida’s perfor-
mance against Florida State on Saturday.
Junior Carlos Omana earned the SEC Male Swimmer 
of the Week honor for the ﬁ  rst time, and senior Hilda Luthersdottir won her ﬁ  rst SEC 
Female Swimmer of the Week 
award. Freshman Mitch D’Arrigo notched his third SEC Male 
Freshman of the Week award of this season.
Omana started off the individual competition by cap-
turing the 1,000-yard freestyle  with a time of 9:08.26 and capped it off with a win in the 400-yard individual med-ley  with a time of 3:54.69. Florida made it a sweep of the distance freestyle events when D’Arrigo grabbed a win in the 500-yard free (4:25.27) and another in the 200-yard 
free (1:38.36).
Luthersdottir touched ﬁ  rst in the 100-yard breaststroke 
(1:02.96), just 0.03 seconds ahead of Florida State’s Sami 
Pochowski. 
She also won the 200-yard breaststroke (2:17.09) and 
swam the breast leg of the winning 400-yard medley relay (3:42.27) with the fastest split in the ﬁ  eld.Three Gators swimmers honored in SEC weekly awards

0.1Season averages as of Jan. 7, 2014UF Swimmingday last year conditioning, getting physi-
cal therapy and hands-on training with UF’s team trainer. 
“For one ounce of prevention, it’s like 
one pound of care,” she said.  “You have to work all the time just to prevent those little injuries.
“The physical pain itself you’re 
always just going to have lingering around. I don’t think I’ll be 100 percent ever again.”
UF senior Mackenzie Caquatto was another factor in her sister’s return to the mat. Mackenzie has also suffered her share of injuries.
“We both kind of have banged up 
bodies, so we would go rehab together,” 
Bridgette Caquatto said. During the first week of the 2014 
season, Bridgette Caquatto suited up, 
stretched and practiced just like every 
other Gator. In warm-ups, she ran past a 
recent addition to the “Perfect 10 Wall,” where all Gators who set UF program records with a perfect score of 10 are 
honored. 
A picture of Mackenzie Caquatto was 
hung on that wall after she scored a per-
fect 10 on uneven bars event on Jan. 18, 2013, against Missouri.
Finally healthy this year, Bridgette 
Caquatto has a shot at getting her photo up on the wall next to her sibling.
“I think his motor and his energy has been 
much, much better up to this point in time then it 
has in any previous years.”
Despite slimming down, Young had a hard 
time starting the season, and his total number of points and rebounds tanked.
In the first two games of the year against North 
Florida and Wisconsin, Young made only 2 of 8 shots while grabbing just eight boards. Even Ja-cob Kurtz, who walked on the squad in 2011 after being the team manager, recorded three more re-bounds than the man who drew comparisons to 
Dwight Howard and Amare Stoudemire.
But in the nine matchups since, Young’s play 
has steadily improved, averaging 11.1 points and 
6.3 rebounds per game. 
In his last two outings against Richmond and 
Savannah State, the senior totaled 30 points on 13-of-18 shooting.
“I think he’s doing a lot more things that we 
would like to see him do that maybe we were miss-
ing the last couple of years,” Donovan said. “Pat-
ric is an opportunity scorer. In the last game he was 6 for 8, that’s good. He’s going to get fouled some, he gives us a presence at the basket; he’s a 
big, strong kid.”
Although he lost 10 pounds, the Gators big man 
has not lost any strength. Despite the slow start 
to the season, which saw him averaging five re-bounds in his first seven games, Young has pow-
ered his way to grabbing seven boards per game in 
his past six contests.
Young’s newfound mobility and agility have 
helped him tie for ninth in the SEC in offensive rebounds per game with just more than 2.9.
With Young’s resurgence in the frontcourt 
alongside transfer Dorian Finney-Smith, who leads 
the team with 7.7 rebounds per game, the Gators 
are riding a five-game winning streak and 23-game home winning streak into the SEC opener.
Another strong outing by Young against South 
Carolina should help Florida tie the school’s lon-gest home winning streak tonight.
But to his teammates, Young is much more than 
the numbers he records when on the court.
The center is one of four seniors on the team 
and is a leader on and off the floor. Michael Fra-zier II said despite all of the skill on the squad, the team still needs the more-experienced players to keep everyone in line.
“(The seniors) do a good job of keeping us fo-
cused during games and just telling us we have to stay in the moment, focus on the task at hand,” Frazier said.
“That’s very valuable to a team like this. We 
have a lot of talent, but we need guys to kind of keep us zoned in to what we need to do.” WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15
Florida begins season at 
UAB Blazer Invitational
Neither finished worse than 
second in a combined eight 
meets.
Ebony Eutsey and Lanie 
Whittaker will lead the way in sprints. 
“I think the women have 
more physical talent across the board than the men do,” Hol-loway said. 
“It’s just the men have 
kind of figured it out, and the 
women are starting to figure it 
out.”
The Gators lost Ugonna 
Ndu, arguably their best hur-
dler from last season, and 
Mandy Perkins, a key con-tributor in distance, to gradua-tion. But UF has alleviated the loss of Ndu by adding one of 
the best short hurdlers in the 
country, Bridgette Owens, a transfer from Clemson. Owens was a first-team All-American in the 60- and 100-meter hur-
dles in 2012. 
Holloway believes the 
women are a more talented 
group than last year. With one of the top recruiting classes in 
the country coming in, he be-
lieves they can compete for a title this year.  
“We can’t be complacent,” 
he said. “We can’t rest on our laurels. 
“We have to understand 
that nobody is going to roll over and play dead for us.”
Both teams start the 2014 
indoor season on Friday in Birmingham, Ala., at the UAB Invite. 
“We’re ready to get this 
thing started,” Holloway said. “We’re tired of running, jump-ing and throwing against each other.”Track , from page 13Hoops , from page 13Finney-Smith,
