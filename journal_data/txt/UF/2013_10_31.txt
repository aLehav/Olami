During a recent tour, a young girl 
introduced herself to Jade Salamone by 
saying, “I’m horriﬁ  ed of bats.”
But that sentiment turned when the 
girl came face-to-face with the creatures. Salamone beamed when she described 
the girl’s changed perspective.
“She was not scared,” said Salamone, 
a bat keeper. “She was in love.”That’s one of the missions of Lu-
bee Bat Conservancy in northeast Gainesville: educating the public about the critters often considered creepy. The conservancy conducts year-round research and uses the fall months — particularly the Halloween season — to capitalize on the heightened interest.
The conservancy hosts a yearly bat 
festival, which took place last weekend, as well as private group tours through-out the year.
Getting people close to bats is one 
way to debunk misconceptions about the animals, said Brian Pope, the con-servancy’s director.
“Bats are not these scary, rabid, nas-
ty-looking things,” he said. “They are cute, they’re charismatic, and they’re gregarious. This is a really good intro-
duction to dispel some of these myths.” Bats, research facility dispel myths
� BUT UF CANNOT PROHIBIT A 
STUDENVT FROM WEARING A COSTUME.

This Halloween, with a history of blackface 
in Gainesville in mind, UF students have been 
discouraged from seeing cultures as costumes.
Patricia Hilliard-Nunn, a UF African-Amer-
ican studies lecturer, said dressing in blackface 
is disrespectful because those people are un-
dereducated in African culture and might not understand how images of other cultures can be hurtful.
“You can almost predict every Halloween 
someone is going to do that,” she said. “I just want them to be aware of that history.”
Dekendrick Murray, president of the UF 
Black Student Union, agreed.
People shouldn’t get angry when others 
dress in blackface, he said. Instead, they should help educate those people.
“If you want to mimic black culture, you can 
do it without painting your face,” said Murray, a 21-year-old family, youth and community sci-ences senior.
But controversial costumes can go beyond a 
painted face.
Emily Vasiliou, 18, a UF microbiology fresh-
man, said she was out celebrating Halloween when she saw a white man dressed up with chains around him and assumed he was sup-posed to be a black slave.
“I was offended because that’s just so rude 
and disrespectful,” Vasiliou said. “He should know better. He should have common sense.”
However, Chris Loschiavo, the associate 
dean of students and director of the ofﬁ  ce of Student Conduct and Conﬂ  ict Resolution, said the university cannot prohibit a student from Gators should 
be careful 
with costumes
� IT’D BE IN SUWANNEE COUNTY.

Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org
LIVE OAK — When Suwannee County 
resident Lori McCraney describes the ideal vision for her county, she never imagined 
an incinerator.
But plans have been formed for a facil-
ity that would burn medical waste — in-cluding amputated body parts and waste from abortion clinics — about an hour from 
Gainesville.
For the past few months, Suwannee County ofﬁ  cials and residents have been 
involved in a struggle with a startup medi-cal waste management company.  The com-pany wants to buy land for the incinerator, but many people don’t want it there.
McCraney, an administrator of the 
group Suwannee County Says No to Toxic Waste, said  Integrated Waste Management Systems is looking to take advantage of Su-wannee so it can burn medical waste, which would be trucked in from across the U.S.  
“They want to ﬁ  nd a little rural com-
munity that doesn’t know any better, and once they’re here, they’re never going to go Residents up in arms about medical incinerator to burn body partsSEE COSTUME, PAGE 4SEE BATS, PAGE 4

controversial it may be.
All the university can do is edu-
cate people, he said.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
wrote in an email that the university strives to make campus a welcom-ing environment for people of all races, cultures and backgrounds.
“Part of that is helping students 
understand that stereotypical cos-tumes can be hurtful, even if unin-tentional,” she said.
Still, UF has made headlines in 
the past for controversial costumes.Last October, members of the 
UF fraternity Beta Theta Pi dressed up in blackface at an off-campus  “rockstars and rappers” social, ac-cording to Alligator archives. The 
posted Instagram photo that was 
later deleted sparked controversy and a town hall meeting that aimed to solve cultural issues at UF. The fraternity later issued an apology.
Hilliard-Nunn said dressing in 
blackface is a decision that could af-
fect students’ futures.
“That’s your image down the 
line,” she said. “What if you want 
to run for governor of Florida? I don’t want that type of person to represent me.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2013

A local organization is offering a 
pumpkin pickup service for downtown-
area residents Friday to help reduce the waste from rotting jack-o’-lanterns.
Gainesville Compost, a bicycle-pow-
ered organization that aims to turn local restaurants’ and residents’ leftover food scraps “from waste to food” will contrib-ute the pumpkins to its compost bins that help nourish a network of local gardens.
The service is offered to those who live 
within a two-mile radius of downtown Gainesville. For $4, up to two pumpkins will be collected, and extra pumpkins can 
be collected for $2 each.
Chris Cano, the organization’s found-
er, will bike around the downtown area, 
collecting pumpkins from those who sign up at GainesvilleCompost.com/Pump-kin-Pickup.
Cano said the service takes away the 
nuisance of cleaning up a rotting pump-kin and also puts the waste to a better purpose than taking up space in a land-fill.
“I think that it’s important to raise 
awareness about the problem of food waste and the local solution we offer,” Cano said.
Angela Neal, a 21-year-old UF business 
administration senior, said she would pay to compost a pumpkin, but she said many college students probably wouldn’t real-ize the importance of reducing waste.
“College students don’t have a lot of 
money and don’t see the value,” Neal said.
However, she said she thinks families 
with steady incomes will be more likely to participate.
Joseph Floyd, zero waste coordina-
tor for UF’s Office of Sustainability, said Halloween in general creates an excessive amount of waste and that this initiative is 
an effective way to bring attention to that 
issue.
“If you can afford the pumpkin, you 
should be able to afford the $4,” Floyd said.Locals to compost pumpkins

Max Brooks, author of best-selling books 
“The Zombie Survival Guide” and “World 
War Z,” left the audience in a packed Reitz Union Rion Ballroom convulsing with laugh-ter.
Brooks’ talk satirized popular horror me-
dia, taking jabs at thrillers like “28 Days Lat-er” and romantic comedies like “Warm Bod-ies.” Even his own “Zombie Survival Guide” wasn’t safe, as he remarked on how the book was placed in bookstores’ “humor” section.
“I don’t find anything remotely funny 
about being killed and eaten by a zombie,” he said. “Quite frankly, I find them terrify-
ing.”
His social commentary extended to why 
most aren’t prepared to survive a zombie 
apocalypse, and he explained how everyone can better prepare themselves to face an on-slaught of the undead.
Throughout his speech, Brooks mocked student comments, with one girl in the audi-ence being his go-to after she mentioned her zombie-killing weapon of choice was a hal-berd. Brooks said, “Oh my god,” punctuat-ing each sentence she said.
Accompanying Brooks’ 
talk was a variety of activi-ties, including zombifying marshmallows with edible 
marker, practicing marsh-
mallow archery with bows 
fitted to fire the fluffy treat and a photobooth.
After Brooks’ speech, 
a zombie costume contest 
was held, which lacked zombie costumes. A man dressed as Batman’s sidekick Robin was declared the winner.
Kaylee Willet, an 18-year-old theater pro-
duction freshman, said Brooks was hysteri-cal.
“I was surprised to hear his book wasn’t 
intended to be in the humor section,” she said. “I thought that was really funny.”Zombie author kills UF visit,

Lubee bats paint, exercise, play
The more than 200 bats at the conser-
vancy come from tropical climates, enjoy 
eating fruit and like daylight. They aren’t 
blind and don’t use echolocation. The 
Malayan flying fox bats, one of the seven flying fox species housed at the conser-vancy, are among the largest in the world and can have wingspans of six feet.
Out of the about 1,300 species of bats in 
the world, only three species are vampire bats. Pope said public misunderstanding of that fact can reflect poorly on all of the species.
“That gives them a bad rap,” he said.
The Lubee bats don’t live in dark 
caves, and they don’t haunt houses. Their 
abode is a collection of octagonal enclo-sures bathed in sunlight. And they, in fact, paint pictures.
One afternoon last week, Bilbo, a Ma-
layan flying fox bat, clung to the side of 
a small black wire cage hung on his en-
closure.
Inside the small cage was a blue can-vas. Bilbo grabbed and nibbled at pieces of cantaloupe attached to the ends of long-handled paintbrushes.
As Bilbo wiggled the brushes, the ends 
dipped in paint swept across the canvas, 
creating a picture reminiscent of the ab-
stract art style.  
The art projects are one way research-
ers are trying to create a more positive perception of bats. The conservancy sells the paintings online for $25 and at the bat festival.
“It’s a great education tool to help 
people see how they manipulate items,” Salamone said. “It really helps people see them in a new light.”
Like the young girl, most visitors end 
up realizing humans and bats aren’t so different after all. The Lubee bats live near  Gainesville, some have to exercise regularly, and they all have a knack for fun.
“They like to play with toys, they like 
things that make noise, and they like to take things apart,” Pope said. “We defi-nitely like to give them a good life.”BAts , from page 1COstume , from page 1UF tries to welcome allCommissioners have pulled support
away,” McCraney said. “They 
never specified where the waste would be coming from — just a 500 mile radius or greater.”
McCraney said the material 
would be “highly toxic.”
“Currently, anything that 
goes into a red medical waste bag at the doctor is being burned,” she said, “including body parts, human remains from abortion clinics, all kinds of things that are cut off peo-ple.”
Due to an overwhelming 
negative community response, four of the five county com-missioners have pulled support from the incinerator. They have sent the waste 
company a letter asking it 
to build the incinerator else-
where.
Suwannee County Commis-
sioner Phil Oxendine said the letter was “short and sweet” but displayed a clear message.
“We prefer they look some-
where else,” he said, but “they still could buy property and be 
allowed to build here.”
Clyde Fleming, a Suwan-
nee County commissioner, said 
even though the incinerator could have created jobs for the county, he couldn’t sign off on a decision his residents didn’t approve of.
“The people of Suwannee 
County spoke out against it and … I felt uncomfortable,” he said.
Fleming said because the 
company has withdrawn its permit for the site, he thinks the odds of the company building in Suwannee are unlikely.
“It’s not going to happen, as 
far as we know,” he said.
Joy Towles Ezell, a resident 
of neighboring Taylor County, 
said just because the permit has 
been refunded, she doesn’t be-lieve the company has moved past Suwannee.
“I don’t think it’s over with 
yet,” she said. “It’s not easy to stop a company… You have to depend on neighbors to help you fight some polluter from 
locating in your community.”

Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
University Police arrested a 
Gainesville man Tuesday for mak-
ing a bomb threat at UF Health Shands Hospital, the second inci-dent of its kind to stir the UF cam-
pus in a little more than a month.
Officers arrested 47-year-old 
John Adam Hill, of Gainesville, on 
charges of threatening to discharge a destructive device after he claimed he had a bomb on his person in the Shands Cancer Center, according to an arrest report.
Just after midnight, Hill went to 
Shands to see his girlfriend, who was admitted to the hospital earlier that day, said UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber.Staff didn’t allow Hill into the 
hospital for unknown reasons. Hill then told Shands security officials he had a bomb on him and could ig-
nite it at any time, Barber said. Hill  
mentioned he’d drank two beers.
After security contacted police, 
officers responded to the hospi-tal and arrested Hill, Barber said. He was booked into the Alachua County Jail at about 2 a.m. Tues-day, where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $15,000 bond.
The arrest falls about five weeks 
after a UF student was arrested when police reported he made threats at a fraternity rush event. 
Despite the close proximity of 
the two incidents, Barber said bomb threats have been historically rare.
“Contrary to two events occur-
ring in a relatively short amount of 
time,” he said, “it’s not something 
we see very often.”Second recent UF

TRENTON — The Old Gil-
christ County Jail has not been 
running for about 45 years, but owner Arlene Hale, 65, said its spider-laced walls are still very 
much alive with the nonliving.
“We are paranormal investi-
gators,” Hale said of the Old Gil-
christ Jail Ghost Hunters. “I knew the spirits were here. I could see them, and I could hear them . . . But that’s not why I bought this place. I’ve always liked weird things.”
So when a friend put an aban-
doned jail on the market, she jumped on the opportunity.
During a recent tour, Michelle 
Masters, a local pharmacy techni-cian and one of the ghost hunters, shined a dim red light through the cobwebbed corridors, explaining that each cell has a story.
She struggled to open the loud 
gate into what the team calls Cell One.“If you feel something touch 
your butt, that’s Sam,” she said. “Sam loves women.”
Hale said she believes there 
must be hundreds of spirits trapped in the walls of the jail.
“I don’t think we’ve met them 
all, but I know of several we’ve met,” Hale said. “They tell us their names with the EVPs.”
Hale said EVP is short for 
electronic voice phenomena, or unexplainable voices later found in electronic recordings.
In addition to listening for 
electronic voice recordings, the 
team uses cameras, flashlights, 
electromagnetic field detectors and tools called dowsing rods to communicate and record para-normal activity.
To communicate with ghosts, 
the team asks “yes” or “no” ques-tions while one member holds 
the two roughly foot-long rods.
Masters said if a spirit answers 
with “no,” the metal rods point 
straight. If  “yes,” they cross.
The last of the cells visited 
during the tour was Cell Eight, which still has the original, rust-ed-metal bunks suspended from its walls.
Hale said after years of collect-
ing data, the spirits have become comfortable with the team.
“We won’t stay if we feel like 
they don’t want us in there,” she said.
Upstairs from the top bunk in 
Cell Eight, a team member asked any spirit in the room to make 
itself known. The dowsing rods 
remained straight.
The quiet black cell then reso-
nated with the question, “Are you angry that we’re in your room?”
The rods, visible by the red 
light of one of the member’s flashlights, shot together. 
Cell Eight was quickly emp-
tied of every ghost hunter.Ghost hunters use tech to  reach out
“We won’t stay if we 
feel like they don’t want 
us in there.”

problem is it’s become more of an inﬁ  nite echo chamber 
of masturbators and trolls, the stuff of substance hard to come by.
But that’s only one problem. For journalism to suc-
ceed, we need real journalists.
The journalism school at UF, a ﬁ  ne institution, is not 
training tomorrow’s journalists. It is training yester-day’s. We are taught to be impartial mediators in a con-fusing world, shining light on truth and giving a voice 
to the voiceless.
Most of those are perfect goals and shouldn’t be dis-
missed. What should be is the idea of journalists as “im-
partial mediators.” It’s impossible to be one.
This impartiality often leads to the bad practice of 
false balance, one that plagues journalism today. Here’s how:
Imagine a world about to destroy itself because of 
a changing climate — actually, we live in that world, 
so forget imagining it. Recently, the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change released a much-publicized report that climate change is happening, no ifs, ands or buts about it. I believe their exact words were “warming 
of the climate system is unequivocal.”
That should have been written on the top of every 
paper in 72-point font. Big, glaring headlines, so no one 
could ignore the fact that we’re looking at doomsday in a few decades.  
Here’s where false balancing comes in. While only 
3 percent of climate scientists deny global warming, 18 percent of voices in Bloomberg News, The Los Ange-les Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington 
Post denied climate change. Fox News, naturally, was 
much worse — 69 percent of people interviewed denied it.Climate change is an issue 
scientiﬁ  c in nature but political in its manifestation. The evi-
dence stems from science, but 
society’s answer can only come through politics. This leads journalists to do tricks they’ve 
been taught to maintain their 
image of objectivity. They try to 
balance an issue based in fact with opinions that aren’t.
They are forced to ignore facts and treat climate 
change as any political issue. Journalists covering the is-
sue reach out and quote people who should be deemed 
conspiracy theorists. While they may be searching for impartiality, a journalist’s job is to report facts, not per-petuate myths.
Bias is inherent in the human experience — we know 
the world only through our unique perception of it. So the second a journalist chooses which quote to use in a story, they’re including bias. Editorializing begins the moment a journalist decides which questions to ask a 
source or even how to focus their story.
As a professional journalist, however, it’s taboo to 
express any opinion. I’ve been personally contacted by 
a previous editor from the Tampa Bay Times because 
my Facebook postings were too opinionated. Of course, 
the editor was trying to ensure I wouldn’t miss out on future career opportunities, but I believe in journalism as a search for truth. When you hide your bias behind this sense of impartiality, you rob readers of that truth. 
If they know where you’re coming from, they can judge 
your work accordingly.
Until then, Fox News and MSNBC will continue to 
be taken at face value — and all that’s given us is some 
good material for “The Daily Show.”

Have fun, and don’t 
be rude
Unless your religion doesn’t allow it or you hate fun, 
you’re probably celebrating Halloween. Maybe you 
have the coolest costume ever — perhaps a clever pun, 
an on-point topical reference, a cute couple’s getup or a skin-baring masterpiece.
Every Halloween like clockwork, Internet pearl clutchers 
will lament the proliferation of “slutty” Halloween costumes. 
Nothing is safe, they say: There’s a sexy pizza costume, a sexy 
cheeseburger costume and even a sexy french fry costume — 
coincidentally, all made by the same retailer.
Look, if you want to be a sexy french fry, just go for it. You 
be a sexy french fry, and you be the sexiest french fry you can be. We saw the costume, and it’s super cute. If you want to be a sexy ear of corn, a sexy Angry Bird, a sexy Oompa Loompa or 
whatever, run with it because all of those costumes are hilari-
ous.
It’s safe to say we’ve reached a point in our culture in which 
we can all laugh about the sexualization of everything from 
cartoon characters to fast-food items as Halloween costumes. 
The sexy costumes have transcended sexy and become a par-
ody, and everyone is in on the joke. No one takes “sexy pizza” 
seriously, so calm down, “Today” show.
Halloween is about having fun and escaping the mundane 
routine of classes, sweatpants and Netﬂ  ix for one night. It’s 
about binging on candy, carving pumpkins and reliving your 
childhood for a moment while those summer internship ap-plications sit on the back burner for a few hours. It’s not about shaming people for their costume choices — unless they’re boring or unoriginal.
In her Buzzfeed piece “In Defense of Sexy Halloween Cos-
tumes,” Kyra Richards, a contributor who dressed in Lil Kim’s iconic 1999 VMAs outﬁ  t — you know, the long purple wig and the purple seashell pastie — wrote, “At this point a ‘sexy 
bunny’ or nurse or whatever is like the C-Span of costumes — 
really boring!”
In addition, Halloween is not a free-for-all fat-shaming 
spree — although a woman in North Dakota would have you think otherwise. A woman who called into a radio show in Far-
go made headlines yesterday when she announced she would 
be withholding candy from children she deemed “moderately obese.”
The woman, who refused to identify herself, told the radio 
station, “I think it’s just really irresponsible of parents to send them out looking for free candy just ‘cause all the other kids are doing it.”
No! That is not how you Halloween! It is, however, the best 
way to ensure your house will be TP’d beyond recognition. Hope you’re looking forward to a porch full of ﬂ  aming bags of dog poop, lady.
Bottom line: It’s Halloween. Eat some Reese’s Cups. Wear a 
skimpy costume or don’t. But don’t ruin other people’s fun.

What to watch: ‘Adam Devine’s House Party’
The show has a unique structure that throws stand-
up comedy, sketch comedy and partying into one mix. Read the story on page 8.Curated ads introduced to Instagram last week
The company is only allowing a few brands to advertise on the photo-sharing app for now, but they’re doing it classily. Read the story on page 9. Look for Kathryn Varn’s Seven Day Setlist online at alligator.org/the_avenue.We make national news regularly, we surrender 
the thought of good hair days to humidity, and we aren’t exactly on the way to any other state. It’s no wonder music artists, like seasons with the exception of summer, avoid Florida.But by some pre-Thanksgiving miracle, new music festival Coastline will bring alternative acts Passion Pit, Matt & Kim, Surfer Blood and other indie darlings to Tampa on Nov. 9 and West Palm Beach on Nov. 10.Tickets are still available online and range from $25 to $40. On Friday, the prices will rise to $30 for lawn seats and $45 for reserved seats.The first-year festival will also feature local craft brews, a tent where locals will showcase their art and a food truck area with selections ranging from tacos to barbecue to Mediterranean.This week, the Avenue chatted with members from three of the headlining acts.

Fest, an annual punk music festival, has 
gotten so big that this year it officially start-
ed with a Pre-Fest in Ybor City on Tuesday.
The festival has about 400 bands on its 
lineup — nearly 100 more than last year. Starting on Halloween, Fest 12 will be the longest running yet, with more than 2,500 
people expected to attend.
“I think if you live in this town, even if 
you aren’t into the music, you know Fest 
is here,” said event organizer Tony Wein-bender.
When he saw this year’s weekend in-
cluded Halloween, he decided to extend the festival to four days. Bands will perform in 12 downtown venues, including the Florida 
Theater, the Atlantic and the Civic Media 
Center. Costumes are encouraged for the Halloween weekend.
Passes for Fest are still available and can be purchased at registration at the Holiday Inn. A four-day Fest pass costs $150. Walk-
up tickets for individual venues range be-
tween $10 and $25.
Although it is referred to as a punk mu-
sic festival, Weinbender, 37, stresses that 
there are too many types of music available 
at Fest to be pigeonholed, and a common thread among bands is that most are on in-dependent labels.
“It’s an amazing showcase of the DIY 
music culture,” he said.  
Over the years, Fest has brought bands 
like Streetlight Manifesto, Matt & Kim, Against Me, Frank Turner and Paint It Black 
to Gainesville.
“Many don’t realize that there is liter-
ally something for everyone,”  said Austin 
Amodt, a 21-year-old UF history senior.
“Some of my friends think of Fest as the 
time of year when the streets are filled with PBR-drinking punks, but these stereotypes die hard,” he said. “As a member of an IFC fraternity who is currently applying to law schools, I may not appear as the stereotypi-cal Fest goer, but this just shows the diver-
sity of attendees that you can find.”
The fact that Fest has 
grown so big has more 
than just punk fans ex-
cited.
Rockeys Dueling Piano 
Bar will feature comedians 
on Saturday and Sunday. 
Kyle Kinane will be the headlining comic, 
and 17 other comedians are scheduled to 
perform.
For more than a decade, Weinbender has 
seen Fest mature and become a yearly tradi-
tion for some people. 
He estimates Fest has a core of about 
1,000 who show up every year to Gainesville 
to stay the weekend and to watch bands.
Ana Fajardo, a UF public relations junior, 
said she enjoys Fest because she gets to see friends from out of town.
“We can be smelly and crusty and spend 
all our money on merch together,” she said.
As word about Fest spread overseas, 
music lovers began coming from as far as Brazil, Japan and South Africa. Last year, 17 percent of attendees traveled from outside the United States. 
Some Fests ago, a wedding party of 20 
from Scotland visited Anthem Tattoo Parlor for Fest tattoos. The couple then got mar-ried at No Idea Records, the main sponsor of Fest, said Mike Salay, owner of Anthem 
Tattoo.
The No Idea stress face logo is a popular 
Fest souvenir. 
This year, there are 25 to 50 designs Fes-
ters can get tattooed for the shop’s mini-
mum price of $50.
The couple from Scotland are coming 
back for Fest this year with another tattoo appointment at Anthem.
“I think Fest fans, honestly, are just really 
good music fans,” Weinbender said. “They want to support these artists. They want to support this scene.”Fest grows with more bands, attendees and volunteers musicsee Co Astline, p Age 10� THE SHOW TIES TOGETHER HOUSE

“Workaholics” and “Pitch Perfect” star 
Adam Devine said comedy has always come 
naturally.
“I have a weird, big, dumb face that can 
move in all sorts of different directions,” he 
said in a phone interview.  “I think that sort of 
helps me out.”
Devine is bringing his signature s**t-eating 
grin to Thursdays at 12:30 a.m. on Comedy Central with his new show, “Adam Devine’s House Party.” The show is framed as a stand-up showcase featuring up-and-coming com-ics mixed with Devine’s own brand of sketch comedy, with all the raunch and saltiness we’d 
expect from a “Workaholics” star.
The premise of the show revolves around 
Devine as he hosts a stand-up showcase in a 
Hollywood mansion with a massive party budget provided by Comedy Central. The show will also feature live performances from indie bands Trash Talk and Palma Violets.
Devine said the show is partly based on 
the wild house parties he threw with his fel-
low “Workaholics” stars when the show ﬁ  rst began ﬁ  lming.
“It’s kind of nice if you can just get a giant 
bathtub and ﬁ  ll it with ice and a ton of Busch Lights and get wicked,” he said.
House parties, he said, are right up his al-
ley. He prefers them over the hip L.A. bar scene, where $15 drinks the size of thimbles 
and pretentious fedora-wearing bartenders are commonplace.
“[The show is] just sort of a conglomera-
tion of all the crazy house parties I’ve been to where you ﬁ  nd someone’s pooped in your closet,” he said.
Devine said he wanted to frame the show 
in a way that would allow the viewers to see 
more of the stand-up comedians — there are 
three stand-up acts per episode — outside of their solo performances. The comics who per-form stand-up also make appearances in the party-scene sketches. 
And not to worry, “Workaholics” fans 
— his costars from the show that launched Devine’s career will be making cameos later in the season, although he maintained that 
“House Party” is his own side project inde-
pendent of his ﬁ  rst show.
“This is sort of my thing I was doing out-
side of the group,” he said.  “I didn’t want it to be too meta — like, a behind-the-scenes of ‘Workaholics.’”
The show, with its unique structure of 
stand-up mixed with sketch comedy, is a risky endeavor. But Devine has the chops to pull it 
off, and fans of old-school Comedy Central 
will rejoice the return of stand-up by newer comics.
“I hope it’s the tightest of b-holes,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2013

Don’t be surprised if you haven’t 
noticed the new ads on Instagram. 
The company is being very cautious about how they introduce them to the public.
Instagram first announced the 
upcoming ads on its official blog at the beginning of the month, but they first appeared on users’ feeds a week ago.
The ads almost look like any 
other posts that would appear on your feed. They stick to the square format, and they are artistic and 
attractive. The main difference is a “sponsored” label and a blue-arrow 
icon replacing the timestamp that normally appears in the top-right corner of an image.  
The company is taking it slow 
initiating its new revenue stream and is only allowing a few trusted brands to post ads at this time, in-cluding Levi’s, Ben & Jerry’s, Adi-
das and Burberry, brands that al-
ready have Instagram accounts. It’s no wonder why the photo-sharing app would want to incorporate ads. 
The free application is used by 18 
percent of cellphone owners, accord-ing to the Pew Research Center’s Internet and American Life Project. And nearly half of cellphone own-ers ages 18 to 29 use Instagram. That means if you walk around campus and ask 10 of your peers, five of them are likely to use the app.
However, only 18 percent of 30- 
to 49-year-olds and 6 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds are Instagram users. So if advertisers want to target mil-
lennials, Instagram is the platform 
for them. However, if millennials aren’t its demographic, the ad team should probably think outside the square.
Bruce Floyd, UF’s social media 
specialist, said he thinks Instagram has begun to include ads because it is owned by Facebook, and Face-book is beholden to its sharehold-ers.
“That’s their 
duty and re-sponsibility to earn revenue, so practically speak-ing, they had to 
do something 
at some point to 
drive some revenue,” Floyd said.
Like its parent company, Insta-
gram allows users to hide individu-al ads and give feedback about why they don’t like them. Instagram’s approach to advertising has been very different from Facebook’s, which primarily uses stock-photo promotions.
However, 19-year-old UF tele-
communication sophomore Tan-isha Bennet said the ads’ similarity to other Instagram content is con-fusing because she doesn’t follow those accounts on her feed. 
Though Bennet thinks the ads 
are cute, she said she liked that In-stagram used to be a break from advertising.
Though the ad launch is limited 
to the U.S. now, eventually, all users will see ads through filtered frames. There’s no escaping it.

Ariel Barnes
Dear Friend,
You don’t need to name something that’s already attached to you. You see 
your boobs every day, and you will never need a name to address them by. 
They’re just two lumps of fat that sit on your chest, and there’s already a word 
for them — it’s boobs. You might as well name your knee caps or your weenis if 
you’re going to name your boobs. The same goes for penises. Don’t ever name your manhood or let anyone else name it. That thing isn’t some pet rock — it’s a functioning piece of equipment, and naming it Stone Cold Steve Austin or the 
Stay Puft Marshmallow Man won’t make it any manlier.Dear Friend,
You don’t necessarily need alcohol to talk to him, but sweet booze always 
makes talking to a crush a lot easier. I only advise that the both of you don’t go overboard. The purpose is to take the edge off, not to end up doing belly shots off of each other. Also, I don’t know if you have experienced what happens when whiskey d--k and whiskey p---y come together, but it’s kind of like trying 
to push Play-Doh into a wall. Avoid that, and just be yourself.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I am having a difficult job naming my boobs. You have 
any suggestions?Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’m having trouble relaxing with this guy I like even though I know he likes 
me back. My friends suggested that we go to a bar to ease things. Is it bad 
that I need alcohol in order to talk to him?
Dear Mediocre Advice,
What does “we’re on a break” mean?Dear Friend,
Breaks are a cop-out. It’s over, but neither of you will make the effort to end it. If one of 
you wants to hook up with other people during your break, then it’s definitely over. This 
vague word means that your friends will start to act like your relationship is already over 
because everyone on earth seems to know you’re single except for you. It’s kind of like 
Joseph Stalin being in limbo. Sure, he’s not in heaven, and he’s not in hell, but that afterlife 
elevator is only going one way, and that’s down. A break is just a half-ass breakup.
Matt & Kim, Surfer Blood and Passion Pit excited to play
A: I think it’s made things hard for bands 
like us. We have popular songs — but we’re 
not Rihanna. I’m still really interested in it, though. I’m curious about what makes a Ke$ha or Rihanna song so magical.
Q: Frontman Michael Angelakos made a 
pretty big decision recently and suspended his Twitter. He told the Salt Lake Tribune that the current norm of musicians connecting with their fans through social media demys-tifies the artist, and he really wants to com-municate through his music. What are your thoughts on that?
A: I agree with it to a certain extent, but I 
also think you just have to be stronger. You can have Twitter and not check it every five seconds and not share your entire life on it. I enjoy having it, and I’ve made a lot of connec-tions through it.
Q: What are the top five things you can’t 
live without while touring?
A: My laptop, an acoustic guitar, my iP-
hone — I can get by pretty well with those three. As long as I have something to work on and something therapeutic to keep me calm, I’m pretty happy.
Matt & Kim talks weather, Swampfest 
and getting wild
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Avenue Writer
Interview with Matt from Matt & Kim:
Q: How do you feel about the upcoming 
Coastline Festival?
A: I’m psyched! It’s been a minute since 
we were in Florida this year. We have been 
but like… we’ll go through Florida and do like five or six, seven shows sometimes, and I feel like there’s a certain amount of getting crazy that happens, which is exactly what I love during the show.
Q: What do you like best about touring in 
Florida?
A: We’re a band that makes a lot of sense in places where there’s sunshine and people are active and like to get wild. Sometimes when we go somewhere darker and colder like the northern UK, it doesn’t make as much sense for our band. So going somewhere south like that is something that works with our band: People just wildin’ out.
Q: How do you stay so energetic during 
your shows?
A: There’s certain days where you have an 
early flight and a late night beforehand and whatnot, but we’re on stage for an hour out of the day or just around that, and there’s 23 other hours in the day when we’re not. And I feel like that one hour when you get out there 
and there’s an audience that’s excited to see 
you, it immediately pops me out of whatever sort of funk I’m in. I don’t know how some bands look so bored on stage because it’s fun and it’s exciting, and the other bands look like they’re taking a nap while they’re playing. And for us, it’s seeing people who are excited to hear this music that you wrote, and I don’t know, it always gets us exhausted.
Q: How is Matt & Kim going to leave their 
mark at the first Coastline Festival?
A: I hope that we leave our mark in just 
people walking away and saying, “That was one of the funnest sets I’ve seen.” I always say that we’re always jumping around and what-not, and we always make mistakes because 
we’re human and whatnot, but I think that 
just the energy of having fun and being in-volved it’s what carries us through it all, and it’s what carries the audience through it all, and I think if people can leave and say,  “I had so much fun.” You don’t even have to know our songs —  it’s not about that. We put all 
sorts of other pieces of other songs and stuff 
like that, and yeah, that’s the bottom line: to have fun.
Q: You guys were scheduled to play at 
UF’s Swampfest this past July, but it was can-celed due to lightning. So how can UF fans get their Matt & Kim dose?
A: That was so sad that day. We were right 
there. We did the soundcheck, and all the vol-unteers were really cool. And we had set ev-erything up, and we were waiting, and that storm came in, and they said the policy about the lightning, and every half an hour, they had to reset the clock, and we just kept hop-
ing it would stop. The worst-case scenario is not being able to play. That’s the whole reason we do all the traveling, and that’s the whole reason people come out, and that’s the whole 
reason it all happens. We were so frustrated 
we ended up hanging out for a while and taking pictures with a lot of wet people who stood out there in the rain. We’re so sorry it didn’t end up working out, and we definitely hope that whoever can make it does make it. I’ll definitely give a special shout-out to the folks that tried to be at that.
Q: What’s next for Matt & Kim?A: The Florida shows are the finale shows 
of the year. They might be two of the last shows before we take a break to write some new music. We’re home for a while, which is weird, because we’ve been on the road for more than half the days out of the year, sort of every weekend. I feel all warmed up just for these finale shows.
Hometown boys Surfer Blood return to 
roots with Coastline
MARJORIE NUNEZ
Avenue Writer
Interview with bass guitarist Kevin Wil-
liams:
Q: When you were ap-
proached about the festival, 
how did you guys decide you were going to play at Coastline?
A: We immediately said 
yes. It’s really exciting to see a cool music festival hap-
pening in South Florida. I haven’t really seen a whole lot in the way of a festival drawing a lot of really large out-of-town bands to South Florida in a while, at least for the style of mu-sic that we like. So it’s really cool, and it blew our minds to be able to play at Cruzan Amphi-
theatre in West Palm Beach. I still remember 
it as the Coral Sky Amphitheatre. It’s the first venue a lot of us saw our first concerts.
Q: Tell me a little bit about the cover art of 
“Pythons.”
A: The cover art kind of manifested itself over a period of time. This idea of a young scrawny kid flexing his arm is a juxtaposition of being that young, and it’s an age where you see the world kind of differently than the world sees you, where you feel invincible, but you’re still a young little, scrawny kid. This idea of being young and being pretty insignifi-cant to the world just kind of started hitting a 
note with us. It’s just the sense, the idea, of self-
perception versus outside youthfulness.
Q: How do you think people’s perception 
of Surfer Blood has changed from the time you guys debuted your first album in 2010 to now?
A: We’ve had a lot of people say that. Ob-
viously, (“Pythons”) is more polished because 
this is our first time in a studio. Both “Tarot 
Classics” and “Astro Coast” were pretty much entirely home recorded in JP’s (frontman John Paul Pitts) apartment. It still essentially was re-cording, it just was in a tricked-out home stu-dio, nothing like a proper studio like when we went to EastWest Studios for “Pythons,” and we had the producer Gil Norton.
Q: I read in an interview that Gil Norton 
really pushed you guys out of your comfort zone.
A: He definitely encouraged us to embel-
lish parts of the songs a little bit more. He would speak almost in riddles sometimes. He’d say, “Make the guitar fly.” He’d say, 
“Play the part but make it fly,” and then Tom 
(guitarist Thomas Fekete) would play this riff, and he’d say no, no, fly, and we had no idea what he was talking about, but I guess that was part of the fun. That was pushing us out of our comfort zone.  
Q: What can people expect for you guys to 
play at Coastline?
A: It’s always tricky. Ideally, we’d love to 
play our full-length set that we play at our headlining shows every night, but with a festival, it’s a little more of a stripped-down set, just by the nature of music festivals. We try to start out strong but still keep the emo-tional numbers in there and try to balance it out. We also try to keep the deeper tracks like 
“Catholic Pagans” and crowd favorites that 
are not necessarily the immediate pop songs but band favorites as well. We try to keep it well-balanced.coastline , from page 7BUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Less than two weeks after testing negative for mononucleosis, 
sophomore guard Michael Frazier II began to feel sick again Sun-
day night.
The Florida training staff saw Frazier exhibiting symptoms of 
mono and decided to test him again. 
This time, the tests were positive.Frazier is sidelined indefinitely with the vola-
tile illness and will miss Florida’s exhibition 
game against Florida Southern on Friday night 
in the O’Connell Center, the team announced Wednesday.
He is the second Florida player in as many 
years to contract mononucleosis. Prior to the be-
see hoops, page 16PHILLIP HEILMAN

Todd Gurley is back for the Bulldogs.
After missing three games with a 
sprained ankle suffered in the second quarter of Georgia’s 44-41 victory against LSU on Sept. 28, Gurley is expected to be 
ready to face Florida at 3:30 p.m. on Satur-
day in Jacksonville. 
“He would help any offense — obvi-
ously he helps theirs coming back with the other weapons around him,” defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. “They’re dangerous. We understand the challenge ahead of us, and we have great respect for him.”
Gurley’s return bolsters a Georgia of-
fense that enters the game sixth in the Southeastern Conference in scoring and 
total offense. Prior to being injured, the 
6-foot-1, 232-pound sophomore ran for 154 yards in a loss to Clemson and 132 yards in a win against South Carolina. 
He added 73 yards on eight carries in 
the first half against LSU.
“He’s a dynamic player,” Bulldogs 
coach Mark Richt said. “Hopefully, he’s 100 percent and we can get him some 
space.”
Georgia (4-3, 3-2 SEC) was success-
ful in opening holes for Gurley during 
a 17-9 win against Florida (4-3, 3-2) last season. He became the only running back to eclipse the 100-yard mark against the Gators in 2012 with a 27-carry, 118-yard performance. Gurley added a touchdown early in the first quarter. 
“He wasn’t going to miss this game,” 
linebacker Michael Taylor said. “I could tell you that from, if I was even in Wiscon-sin somewhere, I could tell you he wasn’t going to miss this game.”
Gurley’s return is met by the return of 
Sam linebacker Ronald Powell (ankle) and defensive lineman Damien Jacobs (head injury), who each sat out Florida’s 36-17 
loss to Missouri. While missing Powell and Jacobs, as 
well as Dominique Easley, who is out for 
the season after suffering a torn ACL, the Gators allowed the Tigers to accumulate 500 yards of total offense.Taylor said the breakdown of Florida’s 
defense was “a one-time thing”, and the redshirt sophomore linebacker guaran-

In Taylor Burke’s past two seasons 
as the starting goalkeeper, she has not 
faced much of a challenge from Georgia 
strikers.
In 2012, Burke spent about 79 minutes 
in Florida’s goal and saw zero action.
The Bulldogs failed to take any shots 
until then-freshman Valerie Tysinger 
subbed in for Burke with 10 minutes left on the clock. 
In 2011, Florida 
faced Georgia twice: 
once in the regular 
season and in the first 
round of the 2011 Southeastern Confer-ence Tournament. 
Between both games, Georgia had 
only seven shots on goal and finished 
none. Both games ended with a Florida 
shutout victory.
Nearing the end of her third regular 
season as a Gator, Burke has gotten even better as the last line of defense.
When No. 6 Florida (14-3-1, 8-2 SEC) 
takes on Georgia (12-5-1, 5-4-1 SEC) in 
Athens, Ga., tonight at 6:30, the Gators 
can put trust in Burke and the back line to close out the regular season on a high note.
“She’s gotten a lot better with her 
communication,” coach Becky Burleigh said.
 “Her strengths have always been her 
kicking game; she’s very good with her 
feet. I think she continues to develop as 
a player for us. 
“We expect a lot of our goalkeepers 
too because they basically see the whole field, and she’s really embraced that.”
The Gators head on the road with 
six straight shutouts against SEC oppo-nents, giving Burke seven solo shutouts this season and 22 solo shutouts in her 
career.
“It’s given us a lot of confidence,” 
Burke said of the team’s shutout streak. 
“Our defense has been playing really 
well, especially being involved in the of-fense as well.” 
Despite Georgia’s dim conference 
record, Burke said the Bulldogs are a 
strong team to go up against.Goalkeeper

UF kickerThe Bulldogs are 7-3 when 
playing at home, and they 
pulled off two consecutive 
road wins last weekend: a 2-1 
victory against LSU and a 1-0 win against Arkansas.
Florida leads the all-time se-
ries with Georgia 24-2-1, with the Gators’ only two losses coming on the road.
Burleigh said the Georgia 
matchup will be a game that 
puts emphasis on maintaining 
possession.
“They play similarly to us in 
that they try to keep it a little 
bit,” Burleigh said. “Their at-
tack is pretty dangerous.”
Florida is tied for the top 
spot in the league with Texas A&M, while Georgia is tied for 
sixth with LSU. 
The Gators are looking to 
claim their second consecutive 
SEC regular season title, need-
ing a win tonight to at least get a 
share of the it. Florida has won 
the regular season crown in six 
of the past seven seasons.
“This big step is left,” Bur-
leigh said. 
“We can’t overlook any-
thing. Georgia is a very good team. They are much improved 
and not only are they much im-proved, but I just think they’re playing with some confidence right now as well. 
“It’s not an easy road for us 
to get there.”
Two Gators honored: Flor-
ida center backs Karina Guts-che and Christen Westphal 
were named to Top Drawer 
Soccer’s National Team of the Week after the Gators notched 
two shutouts against Tennes-
see and Texas A&M during the weekend. 
The duo has started every 
match this season and leads the 
team in average minutes per 
match. Westphal averages 89.2 minutes and Gutsche clocks in 
with 87.7. 
“It feels great,” Gutsche 
said. 
“I think we’ve been work-
ing really hard together, and I think it’s paying off that we get 
that recognition.”
ginning of the 2012-13 season, cen-ter Patric Young dealt with the viral infection during the summer. 
Mono commonly causes fe-
ver, sore throat and fatigue and is spread through saliva, according to the Mayo Clinic.
Last season, Frazier was UF’s 
best three-point shooter with a 46.8 percent clip from behind the arc. The Tampa native averaged 5.6 points and 3.1 rebounds per game 
coming off the bench.
Frazier projected to be a starter 
for Florida to begin the season, but 
he now appears doubtful for Flor-ida’s season opener against North 
Florida on Nov. 8. 
UF enters that game with a thin 
backcourt, as it will not have point 
guard Scottie Wilbekin available. 
Wilbekin will miss an indefinite 
number of games to begin the year due to suspension. Rutgers transfer guard Eli Carter (leg) is rehabbing 
a leg injury.
Sophomore swingman DeVon 
Walker, who decided last week he 
would play this season and not red-shirt, will likely fill Frazier’s role at 
shooting guard alongside freshman 
point guard Kasey Hill in the back-court. 
Sophomore guard Dillon Gra-
ham, who, like Walker, also rarely played last year, could also see more minutes come his way in the backcourt rotation because of Fra-zier’s absence. 
Forward commits to UF: Coach Billy Donovan’s Class of 2014 re-ceived a boost Wednesday with the addition of five-star forward Devin Robinson, the No. 20 recruit in the class according to Rivals.com.Robinson verbally committed 
to Florida over Oklahoma State, Notre Dame and Indiana during a press conference at his high school, Christchurch (Va.) School, on Wednesday afternoon. 
He joins four-star guards Bran-
done Francis, Chris Chiozza and one-handed walk-on guard Zach Hodskins in UF’s 2014 recruiting 
class. 
Robinson is only UF’s second 
out-of-state five-star commit since 
2004, when Corey Brewer, a Port-
land, Tenn., native, chose Florida.
Robinson visited UF on Oct. 12 
and came away impressed.
“I really connected with coach 
Donovan,” Robinson told ESPN. 
“He gets straight to the point, and I need that and I like that. I really felt I could trust him.”
The lanky Robinson, who is 
6-foot-8 and weighs 180 pounds, thrives in transition, has range as a shooter and can defend multiple 
positions thanks to his athleticism.
With Patric Young, Casey Prath-
er and Will Yeguete — three key 
cogs in the frontcourt — graduating after this season — the addition of 
Robinson should help UF fortify its 
depth in 2014-15.teed Georgia would not enjoy similar 
success. 
“If they’re trying to run the ball, 
we want to stop it,” Taylor said. “If they want to throw the ball, and even 
if they do get some completions, 
we want to get them guys on the ground.”
Georgia quarterback Aaron Mur-
ray is the main beneficiary from Gur-ley’s return. The senior has struggled against the Gators in his career. 
Seven of Murray’s 38 interceptions 
have come in three games against 
UF, but he will not be asked to make 
as many plays with Gurley back. 
“He just adds so much to the of-
fense and the run game, obviously,” Murray said of Gurley. 
“When he’s running guys over 
and stiff-arming guys, that just pumps everyone up.” 
Another Gator injured: D.J. 
Humphries is expected to miss 2-4 weeks after suffering a sprained MCL during practice Monday, coach Will Muschamp said Wednesday on the SEC coaches media teleconference. 
With Humphries out, Muschamp 
said Tyler Moore would start at left tackle against Georgia, and Trenton Brown would start at right tackle.16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2013
