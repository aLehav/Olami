A student adds her name to the hundreds of signatures against university budget cuts that were gathered 
Tuesday. Students for a Democratic Society, a UF activist group, planned a protest on the Plaza of the Americas, which drew about 600 students, faculty and staff during their lunch break.

Equipped with a micro-
phone, Deeb Kitchen grabbed 
a cell phone to call state Sen. 
Steve Oelrich before leaving the makeshift stage in the middle of the Plaza of the Americas on Tuesday.
He held out the phone so 
Oelrich, R-Cross Creek, could hear about 500 audience mem-bers chant, “No more cuts.”
Kitchen, co-president of the 
UF Graduate Assistants United, was joined by UF faculty, stu-dents and Gainesville residents in an effort to end cuts to higher 
education. 
The midday rally, which 
lasted about an hour, offered opportunities to proactively oppose UF cuts and layoffs by 
signing petitions to be sent to state legislators and UF admin-istrators. 
Some students even toted 
banners with the phone num-bers of university and state leaders, such as UF President Bernie Machen and House 
Speaker Larry Cretul, R-Ocala, 
encouraging crowd members to call and communicate.
The event, which kicked 
off with music from the local band Raarfaction, brought out 15 speakers, including Student Body President-elect Jordan Johnson and John Biro, presi-
dent of the UF chapter of the 
United Faculty of Florida.Hundreds rally

“How does your belief system 
or lack thereof affect your life?”
This was one question posed 
to five panelists, each represent-
ing a major religious outlook, during UF’s first Interfaith Fo-rum on Tuesday evening in front of about 250 people. Islam, Chris-tianity, Hinduism, Judaism and Non-theism were represented.
“Our goal was to spark reli-
gious dialogue, and I think we accomplished that,” said David Yakobovitch, who was credited 
with initiating the forum’s cre-
ation.Anusha Kota, campus liaison 
for the Hindu Student Council, 
sees her faith as her reflective time, she 
said.
In the four stages 
of life as a Hindu, 
Kota is in the first, or student, stage and still learning.
Allen Williams, a UF graduate who works with Campus Cru-
sade for Christ at UF, lives every aspect of his life for his faith, he said.
“I feel like this isn’t about my 
story, it’s about God’s story,” he said.
Chris Mueller, president of 
the largely non-theist UF group Gator Freethought, believes athe-ism and agnosticism require con-stant consideration.
“Every moral decision is a new 
experience,” he said.

of pathology at UF and a practic-ing Muslim, believes that much of the morality he learned came

When 14-year-old Patricia Aguerrevere 
felt her brother kicking inside her mother’s belly, she knew she was feeling life. Now, as a second-year art history major, she is a member of the Pro-Life Alliance.
Members of the anti-abortion campus 
organization spent five hours planting 2,000 American flags in the grass on the Reitz Union North Lawn Tuesday. 
The event, “Cemetery of the Innocents,” 
was held to demonstrate the number of abortions that occur in the United States.  
A blue tarp sign indicated that each flag 
signified two of the 4,000 abortions that occur each day in the United States.
“Our main focus today is to just raise 
awareness about how much abortion hap-pens,” said Katie Cardinale, a UF philoso-
phy sophomore.In 2005, 1.21 million abortions were 
performed in the United States, according 
to the Guttmacher Institute, a sexual and reproductive health research organization. According to the findings, an average of 
3,315 abortions were performed daily.
“As I planted each flag in the ground, 
I thought, ‘There’s a beating heart this 
morning that’s not going to be alive by to-
night,’” Cardinale said. “It’s just so sad to 
think about.”

St. Pete police chief expresses outrage 
after 8-year-old shot to death on Sunday
ST. PETERSBURG, (AP)  — The chief of 
the St. Petersburg Police Department says he’s outraged by the death of an 8-year-old girl gunned down after a barrage of bullets were fired into a home.
Paris Whitehead-Hamilton was sleep-
ing early Sunday when someone fired more than 50 shots from a semiautomatic rifle. She was struck three times in the back after running from her bed to the liv-ing room.
At a news conference Tuesday, Chief 
Chuck Harmon said the shooting appears to stem from a feud that began a few weeks ago and escalated through the weekend. 
One of the men inside the home the 
night of crime was involved in a shooting the previous evening, and may have been one of the intended targets.
A teenager has been charged with Par-
is’ death, and police are looking for at least three others.� UF freshman first

ceived the call telling them they 
would appear on the show. 
“That was when we realized 
we were going to be on the show together,” Sakowitz said. “I thought, ‘Oh no, this isn’t good. 
I don’t want to compete against 
him. He’s good.”
Friedman said they told the 
producers they knew each other, and the producers made sure 
they did not appear on the same 
show. 
Because “Wheel of Fortune” 
tapes a week’s worth of shows 
in one day, Sakowitz and Fried-
man were able to drive to Or-lando and tape their episodes together. 
 “I’ve never been so nervous 
in my life, except for maybe my bar mitzvah,” Friedman said. “I’m very nervous; you can see it in my show. I felt like the Wil-
liam Hung of ‘Wheel of For-
tune.’”
Friedman ended up winning 
a trip for two to San Francisco including a blimp ride. Sakow-
itz won a trip to Bermuda. Nei-
ther will comment on how much money they won until after their shows air.

 Rahda Selvester, 50 and Jim McCarron, 37, both former homeless people, speak to students Tuesday evening

PRICEVILLE, Ala.  — A man 
facing a divorce trial shot and killed 
his estranged wife, their teenage daughter and two other relatives in rural north Alabama before return-
ing to his home in a nearby town 
and killing himself, authorities said Tuesday.Kevin Garner’s body was found 
Tuesday afternoon near his Priceville home, which burned to the ground overnight. His divorce trial was to 
start Wednesday.
Garner apparently shot himself 
in the chest, said Travis Clemmons, 
chief investigator for the sheriff’s of-ﬁ  ce in Lauderdale County, where the four bodies were found earlier in the day in a home in Green Hill, a small community near the Tennes-see line.
The victims were identiﬁ  ed as 
Garner’s estranged wife, Tammy, 
40; their 16-year-old daughter, Chelsie; Garner’s sister, Karen Beaty 
of Illinois; and Beaty’s 11-year-old son, whose name was not released.
Investigators said the four were 
shot, apparently with a handgun, around midnight Monday. They 
did not know if Kevin Garner was 
licensed to carry a ﬁ  rearm.
It was one of eight mass shootings 
around the country — and the third in Alabama — in the last month that have left grief-stricken communities in shock.
Court ofﬁ  cials said the Garners 
were in court Monday in advance of the trial and nothing seemed un-
usual.
In the divorce ﬁ  le, Tammy Gar-
ner sought custody of their daughter 
and alleged that her husband “has been both physically and emotion-ally abusive.”

 Kyle Evers’ Tuesday start-
ed like many other people in Gainesville. He woke up at about 7 a.m. next to his wife with his dog at the foot of the bed.
He then got up, ate breakfast 
and took a shower. But the dif-ference between Evers and most other Gainesville residents is that he woke up in a tent, where he has lived for the past three months, and his shower and breakfast came from St. Francis House, a local homeless shelter.
Evers, 21, spoke at UF Tues-
day night along with three other  homeless or previously homeless people  as part the So-ciety of Professional Journalists’ “Faces of Homelessness” Speak-ers Bureau program. Eighteen students attended.
Evers and his wife have 
been homeless for the last sev-eral years. They came to Gaines-ville’s Tent City three months ago from Palatka.
Tent City is a wooded area 
off of Depot Road in southeast Gainesville where many of Ala-chua County’s 1,600 homeless people live.
The bureau regularly brings homeless people to UF to speak 
to students and dispel stereo-
types, said Amanda Gunn, co-ordinator of the bureau.
“It’s a learning event, we’re 
trying to break the myths about homeless people,” Gunn said.
When Gunn asked the audi-
ence what they thought when they heard the word “home-
less,” responses included 
“dirty,” “mentally disturbed” and “bearded.”
Yet the homeless people in 
the room met none of the de-scriptions.
Three of the four said they  
had been raised in middle-class families and never expected to 
be homeless.
Gunn said that many don’t 
realize why some people end up 
on the streets.
Reasons range from natural 
disasters, losing jobs, domes-tic violence, lack of affordable housing or substance abuse, she said.
Colin Simmons, a 20-year-old 
journalism major, went to the event to learn more about the what the homeless go through. 
“Seeing the dichotomy 
between young college stu-dents and young homeless people was amazing,” he said. ON CAMPUSProgram aims to dispel stereotypes of homeless

UF’s Student Senate discussed up-
coming changes to the Reitz Union’s 
food choices, including the closing of Wendy’s, at Tuesday night’s meeting. 
Reitz Union director Eddie Daniels 
stopped by at the beginning of the meet-ing to update senators on the upcoming changes. Pollo Tropical, the fast-food Latin restaurant replacing the Italian chain, Capeesh, should open by early July, he said. 
But Latin food won’t be the only new 
dish.
Daniels said Papa John’s Pizza will 
take over Subway’s spot. He said Sub-way will move to the ground floor and will offer three lines instead of two. 
Wendy’s will leave the Reitz Union 
on May 1, with Burger King or Chee Burger Chee Burger taking its place dur-ing the summer. 
“Wendy’s made a business decision 
that they can no longer continue under 
(Aramark’s) terms,” Daniels said. “The 
university really has no choice in the matter. The contract between Wendy’s and Aramark will no longer work out.” 
Later in the meeting, senators hotly 
debated for nearly a half hour before passing a resolution supporting the DREAM Act. A resolution is a piece of legislation that states the opinion of Sen-
ate but takes no action.
Some senators took issue with the 
resolution’s phrasing and proposed the 
wording be changed to merely encour-age students to educate themselves on the issue. But the majority felt Senate should 
take a stance. 
“Vote it up or vote it down based 
on what you believe,” said Orange and Blue Sen. Jonathan Ossip, who urged senators not to water down the resolu-tion’s wording. 
The DREAM Act, which will be 
brought before the U.S. Congress in October, would allow undocumented 
students to attend a university. To be 
eligible for college, the students must have lived in the U.S. before turning 16 years old and must have a high school diploma or its equivalent to be eligible. 
Earlier, about 15 members from  
Gators for a Sus-tainable Campus stopped by to speak 
about recently being 
denied SG funds from the Budget and 
Appropriations Committee.
Committee chairwoman Virlany Ta-
boada said next year the organization, which is three years old, could receive funding from a new SG agency, Gators Going Green, which replaced Senate’s Environmental Affairs Cabinet.
UF wildlife ecology and conserva-
tion senior Sara Hutton, the president of Gators for a Sustainable Campus, said the organization will seek funding from a different Senate committee.
Still, she said she scheduled a meet-
ing with Vice President of Student Af-fairs Patricia Telles-Irvin to ensure fund-ing for next year.  
“We are going on good faith and 
assuming SG has the best intentions in mind,” Hutton said. “We don’t want to make this into a political battle.”SG discusses Reitz,

Lorrie Kenney, interim executive director of 
A Woman’s Answer Medical Center, spoke to a crowd of about 20 members of the Pro-Life Alliance on the Reitz Union North Lawn Tues-day night.
“Our mission is to intercept harmful behav-
iors and help women in the crisis that they feel they’re in by providing educational materials 
about their options,” Kenney said. 
“We feel very strongly that a 
woman who does seek an abor-
tion should be equipped with 
education of the physical and 
emotional risks.” 
Aguerrevere said she hoped the event would 
bring abortion to the attention of passers-by. 
“You’re discriminating against someone 
who’s smaller than you and less developed and in a different location,” Aguerrevere said.Flags were planted to symbolize abortions

Pageant Philanthropy
Elizabeth “Bitsey” Walsh, who won the title of “Miss Greek 2009,” stands 
next to a check of the money raised by sororities during the Miss Greek Pageant in the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts Tuesday night.
Biro said students and faculty should en-
courage friends to voice their stance against 
UF layoffs and program cuts to public rep-
resentatives.  
Paul Ortiz, the UF history professor who 
hosted the rally, said he understands that, 
in the present economic crisis, everyone is 
hurting.
But education shouldn’t be cut on any 
level, he said, in an interview after the 
event. 
“Education cuts don’t heal,” Ortiz said.
He also said the recession makes educat-
ing college students even more important 
because they will help pull the U.S. out of its economic downturn.
Steve Holt, a UF political science senior 
who signed each petition, said Florida’s ed-ucation is also the key to rebuilding its own economy.
Cuts in state funding to education repre-
sent cuts to opportunities for future genera-tions, he said.
Between 150 and 200 people signed each 
of the event’s  petitions, an effort led by Co-
alition Save Our Schools, according to Nina 
Martinez, a volunteer for the student-run organization. 
One petition will be sent to representa-
tives in Tallahassee, while the other is in-
tended to circulate among President Ma-
chen, UF Provost Joe Glover and UF Board of Trustees members.
In an interview after the speech, Biro, the president of UF’s United Faculty of Florida, said the problem goes beyond the state Leg-
islature and involves UF’s response to the 
proposed cuts.
He said he worries UF’s administration 
will use the cuts to pursue its own agenda 
without consulting students and faculty.
“If Machen or Glover think that UF needs 
to shift its direction, let them say why and 
let the various constituents discuss it, and if a consensus emerges that it is a good idea, 
then it will be done,” Biro said.
Alluding to the still uncertain nature of 
the cuts, Biro said he believes the Legisla-
ture will enact cuts that are less than those 
predicted by UF.
“UF wants those predictions to govern 
rather than the reality,” he said. 
But spokeswoman Janine Sikes insist-
ed UF is fighting to limit budget cuts and 
said by April 16 she anticipates the budget reduction proposals from all colleges and administrative units will be posted on UF’s 
budget Web site, budget.president.ufl.edu, 
to encourage discussion before decisions are made. 
She said the biggest problem in planning 
for the cuts is the uncertainty surrounding 
the size of them.
“We just don’t know what it’s going to 
look like yet,” she said.People encouraged to voice opinions
from  his faith and his family.
“The part that is there that 
makes me do things is personal responsibility,” he said.
Dave Baum, a former UF stu-dent who is graduating from rab-
binical school this year, feels that the strict dietary laws and other 
rules of Judaism have a heavy in-
fluence on his life.“It teaches you a lot about self-
control,” he said.
The forum start-
ed with a 50-minute introduction, each panelist having 10 
minutes to discuss his beliefs, 
followed by a round of questions asked by the moderator and then 
the audience.
One audience member asked 
Khan about how the statement that men and women are equal in Islam appears to conflict with the use of veils. 
Khan passed the question to a Muslim woman in the crowd who was wearing a head scarf.
“You don’t judge her based on 
her looks, you get to know her personality first,” said Razan Al-Nahhas, a UF biology student. “It doesn’t bring the woman down, 
it elevates her.”Campus groups representing five different faiths gathered at the forumprotest , from page 1

Governor veto no match 
for same-sex marriage
ColumnKudos to KumarStarting Sept. 1, the state of Vermont will legally recognize 
same-sex marriages, thanks to legislative action, rather than a court ruling.
Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas vetoed the bill addressing the 
subject, but support by the Senate and House of Representa-
tives overrode his opinion on the matter.
While the margin of vote in the Senate was overwhelming-
ly in favor of the bill, roll-call in the House of Representatives 
proved to be a tenuous situation where a two-thirds margin was barely achieved.
The passage of the legislation marks a total of four states in 
the United States that protect same-sex marriage by law as Ver-mont joins the ranks of Massachusetts, Iowa and Connecticut. 
News from Vermont may only be the start of a wave of 
states passing similar measures as New Jersey, Rhode Island and Maine continue to work to push bills dealing with same-sex marriage.
The Editorial Board applauds the Vermont state legislature 
for its open-minded approach to the same-sex marriage bill as well as for coming together in the wake of Douglas’ veto. 
Thanks to the newly minted legislation, members of the gay 
community in Vermont will be afforded the same legal rights enjoyed by those in a heterosexual marriage. 
We can only hope the other states considering same-sex 
marriage bills of their own can look to a state like Vermont for guidance and direction.
While Tuesday’s announcement may only directly affect the 
citizens of the state of Vermont, there is no discounting the no-tion that America has made yet another stride toward achieving equality for all.
From channeling his in-ner stoner in “Harold and Kumar” to portray-
ing a doctor on “House,” Kal Penn has displayed an ability 
to play a wide array of differ-
ent personalities throughout his career.
His latest role, however, 
will take him far away from the glitz and glamor of the sil-ver screen — all the way to the White House.
After dedicating a great 
deal of time to President Ba-rack Obama’s election cam-paign, Penn was offered and has now accepted the position of associate director of the White House Office of Public Liaison. 
As a result, Penn will be 
putting his acting career on 
hold, focusing all of his at-
tention on forging a bond be-tween the Obama administra-tion and the Asian-American community.
While Penn’s parts have 
portrayed him as everything from a terrorist to an under-achieving slacker, there is no questioning his stellar aca-demic background. 
After double majoring at 
the University of California, 
Los Angeles in film and so-
ciology, Penn balanced his acting career by earning an international security gradu-ate certificate from Stanford University.
And lest we forget men-
tioning his time spent as a lec-turer, teaching a media class 
at the University of Pennsyl-
vania.
Penn’s choice to put aside 
the fame and fortune of Holly-wood to work for the Obama administration shows a ma-ture young man following his true calling in life.
If Penn can bring to his 
new position the same effort and passion exhibited by him in “The Namesake,” there is no doubt he will enjoy great success during his tenure in Washington.
If not, there’s always “Har-
old and Kumar 3.”
Chris Brown catapulted to the highest heights of 
fame at the age of 16 for having “the dance moves of Usher and a voice all his own.” Three years 
later, he was charged for domestic violence against long-time girlfriend and fellow R&B singer Rihanna, to which he pleaded not guilty.
While I am not necessarily a huge Chris Brown fan, 
my little brother is — and that is what worries me. Those in the spotlight are setting examples to very impression-able children, and Brown’s actions are sending a horrible message to his young fans. Raising your hand to strike someone is neither involuntary nor an accident. Yes, it 
may be done in the heat of a moment, but there is still a 
conscious decision to make that move to strike (or bite, in this case), and that is never acceptable.
According to the Domestic Violence Project of Silicon 
Valley, domestic violence happens 10 times more often than it is reported, making it the most under-reported crime in the United States.
The Chriannah (Don’t you just love the way Holly-
wood names squash together oh-so-perfectly?) incident 
is a great wake-up call for this nation.
Many have called Rihanna out for getting the police 
involved, and even more have stated that it was she who 
instigated the attack. The truth of the matter is that no-
body other than the two involved knows all of the facts. 
However, too many people — both men and women — sit idly by and take abuse, both physical and psychologi-cal. Even if Rihanna turns out to be the instigator, it is important that the authorities were informed.
Since a great deal of the details about the case and 
the two celebrities involved are coming from the likes of Perez Hilton and the reporting powerhouse that is TMZ, it may be a little hard to take the issue seriously. 
I’m not saying the attention 
isn’t warranted, though. By all means, Perez, blog to your heart’s content. The more coverage the issue of domestic violence gets, 
the better it is for us all. With the 
couple’s position in the public 
eye, it is even more of a motivator to break this pattern of violence that lurks in the darkness because not enough people are willing to talk about it.
Regardless of what comes of his ruling, this case 
pointed out that it could happen to basically anybody — even the perfect people in the spotlight. It may even happen again, since Rihanna has purportedly decided to 
take him back. Some people just don’t learn.
Locking Brown away isn’t going to solve the prob-
lem as much as getting him proper counseling. Instead 
of making this into a bigger spectacle than it already is, how about we call off the mobs, bring in the therapists 
and get these kids some help?
Only time will tell whether or not Brown’s career is 
over. He has already lost a few of his endorsement deals, 
and his music was pulled off of various radio stations 
since the charges were filed against him in early Febru-
ary.
Maybe he’ll pull a T.I. on everybody and get MTV to 
follow him around as he talks to kids to make sure they don’t go down the same path — stranger things have 
happened.

Guest column
Health insurance companies are 
scared shitless. 
How scared are they? 
So scared that they’ve told Congress they 
are willing to drop the lucrative practice of risk rating. Risk rating is where someone like myself — a healthy, young white male 
— can get excellent health coverage for less 
than $2,000 a year. 
However, someone with the same age 
and health status but who had cancer when he was 5 and has been in remission ever 
since will pay more than $10,000 per year. 
Exchange the word “cancer” in the last 
sentence with just about any sickness from 
severe acne to HIV/AIDS and you have risk 
rating in a nutshell. 
People who are sick, whether by genet-
ics or lifestyle, are forced into debt by sky-
high insurance premiums or back-breaking medical bills.
But in the name of cooperation, insur-
ance companies are now willing to get rid of this approach, albeit with a slight catch — if Congress forces every single person in 
the United States to buy insurance cover-
age. Seriously, guys? That’s like GM saying it’ll improve gas 
mileage if we are all forced to buy at least 
a Chevrolet Malibu. What’s more, they still 
retain the right to charge more by age and geographic location, and they can still deny claims at will as they so often do. Basically, 
the only thing that changes is they make 
tons of money because they now have 50 million new customers.
So what would scare them into such gen-
erous bargaining, you might ask? 
One word: competition. President Barack Obama and Congress 
are considering forming a new public in-surance plan similar to the one currently 
employed by Medicare (government health 
insurance available to every citizen over 65) that would be available for anyone in the United States to buy. 
This plan would be cheaper than private 
plans because Medicare can run on admin-istrative costs of about three percent, com-pared to about 26 percent for the private sector. 
These cost savings are possible because 
unlike for-profit insurance companies, Uncle Sam doesn’t have to pay dividends to investors, doesn’t 
have to pay ridiculous 
executive salaries, doesn’t need to spend 
gobs of money on marketing schemes and doesn’t need to hire legions of middlemen 
to deny claims and peddle their products. 
All in all, we waste over $300 billion a 
year on this administrative muck wrought 
by health insurance companies.
Republican lawmakers, the dukes of 
competition, are vehemently opposed to this new public program because “forcing free-market plans to compete with these government-run programs would create an 
unlevel playing field and inevitably doom 
true competition,” says Mitch McConnell, Senate minority leader. 
You heard him — allowing competition 
into the marketplace would doom competi-
tion. For example, we wouldn’t want to lose 
the competition we have in private health insurance now, which is five companies dominating most of the market share in al-
most every state.
One real concern not being articulated by most opponents of the public plan is that 
it would underpay physicians and hospitals in order to generate lower yearly premiums 
for customers. However, this is unlikely 
since providers (physicians and hospitals) would not be willing to accept a public plan that underpays them, and people would 
not buy it if they knew they couldn’t use it 
anywhere. 
If nothing else, the physician lobby is 
too strong to let something like that slip by were it ever to become a serious consider-
ation.
In short, health insurance companies 
have a right to be scared. They know that 
they can’t compete with anything like 
Medicare. Medicare is more efficient, more 
robust and better-liked by customers and providers than private plans. 
And while just having a government-
run health insurance side-by-side with the 
private system isn’t quite the single-payer 
option we need, it’s a big step in eliminat-ing the for-profit parasite plaguing our health care system.

Assuming you read the headline above 
this column, you know it is going to be about hockey. But I implore you to 
keep reading.
The NHL playoffs start this week — seri-
ously, keep reading — and I would argue that the chase for Lord Stanley’s Cup is the most 
exciting postseason in professional sports. I 
would like to humbly request you all tune in.
Playoff hockey is way better than playoff 
basketball for a number of reasons. In the NBA, you’ve got opening-round matchups 
between one seeds and eight seeds that should 
be sweeps almost every year. Other than Golden State over Dallas a few years back, the top seeds rarely fall in the first round.
In the NHL, top seeds lose all the time. 
Both three seeds lost in the first round last year, and two seasons before that, the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference went all the way to the finals.
In the NBA, last sea-
son’s quarterfinals saw 
all eight top seeds ad-
vance in rather undra-matic fashion. The same thing almost happened 
in 2006, with seven of the 
top eight teams moving to the second round.
But the best thing about the NHL playoffs 
compared to the NBA has to be the overtimes. 
Not only are overtimes way more common 
than in NBA playoffs, but they’re infinitely more exciting.
When a basketball game goes into an ex-
tra period, points are scored frequently and games can be won by 10.
But in hockey, when the game is in over-By KYLE MAISTRI

When UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
and his players were asked which 
freshman impressed them the most 
during the preseason, one name 
surfaced time and again — Preston Tucker. 
The freshman slugger got off to a 
slow start in his first year as a Gator but showed again on Tuesday why his big bat merited so much pre-season hype.
The left-handed first baseman 
went 4 for 4 with a home run and four RBIs and drew a walk in his oth-er plate appearance, lifting UF (20-11) to a 12-7 victory against visiting 
Bethune-Cookman (15-16). 
“He’s always hit. He’s probably 
hit since he was 4 years old. He’s 
a natural hitter,” O’Sullivan said. “What he’s doing right now, we’re 
not totally surprised, to be honest 
with you. That’s why we recruited him. He’s a guy we’ve been bragging about since Day 1.”
Tucker’s 2-run opposite-field 
bomb in the first inning put the Gators ahead 3-1 early, and after the 
Wildcats battled back to tie the game at 6 in the top of sixth inning, he again gave UF the lead with a two-out sin-
gle that drove in Daniel Pigott. 
Tucker’s combined stat line from 
Tuesday night’s game with Bethune-
Cookman and Sunday’s finale with 
Vanderbilt reads: 7-for-8 hitting, 4 runs, three home runs and nine RBIs. In the last two games, four of his at-bats have given the Gators a lead. 
“I was being overaggressive. I 
guess you could say I was swinging at bad pitches,” Tucker said of his early approach.
“I was going up there guessing, 
looking for anything to hit, and now I’m waiting on one pitch, and once I get it, I’m hitting it.”
O’Sullivan frequently used Tucker 
as the designated hitter at the begin-ning of the season, but the freshman has become the everyday first base-man and has been hitting in the fifth 
spot in the lineup. His .347 average 
ranks second on the team behind only junior Matt den Dekker, and his four home runs are tied for the team lead with den Dekker and senior Av-
ery Barnes. He also leads the team 
with 28 RBIs.
As a team, UF is averaging 8 runs

■ OUT-OF-STATE GATORS 
ARE GROWING FAMILIAR WITH THE SEMINOLES.

Like learning to ride a bike or 
how to drive a car, understand-
ing the nature of the beast that is 
the UF-FSU rivalry doesn’t come 
naturally to everyone.
For sophomore right fielder 
Kelsey Bruder, who grew up 
across the country from the sto-
ried in-state rivalry, the yearly showdown didn’t mean nearly as much to her a year ago as it did to the team’s native Floridians.Now, after a full season and 
half in orange and blue, the Semi-noles’ garnet and gold inspires a more emotional reaction.
“Honestly, I wasn’t aware 
UF and FSU existed. We were more in-tune to the UCLA and (Southern Cal) rivalry,” said 
Bruder, who came to Gainesville from 
Corona, Calif. 
“People get 
crazy here. People 
who aren’t even in-
volved in athletics hate FSU for some reason. It spills over and makes us want to win.”

Any remaining hope for the 
Gators to notch their first tourna-
ment victory was blown away on Tuesday.
Wind gusts of up to 28 mph 
helped to deflate the team’s mo-
rale early on.
The No. 30 UF women’s golf 
team shot a combined score of 10 
over par in their first three holes 
of the day at the Lady Gator Invi-
tational, widening the once-nar-row gap of three strokes between them and first place.
The Gators finished the final 
round with a team score of 87 over par for the tournament and came in fifth place on their home course, 14 shots behind first-place Duke and Auburn.
Auburn eventually beat Duke 
in a playoff for the title.
“The wind affected everybody. 
That’s why the scores were so high,” UF coach Jill Briles-Hinton said. “I mean, the course is hard 
enough, but when you add this 
kind of wind, it’s brutal.”
UF could not extend its win 
streak at their home tournament to four consecutive years, but 
sophomore Jessica Yadloczky ex-
tended a streak of her own. 
Her score of 16 over par for the 
tournament tied for the fourth-
best individual score. This is the 
fourth straight event that she finished in the top 10 as an indi-vidual.Freshmen Andrea Watts and 
Evan Jensen also finished near the top of the individual leader-board. 
Watts tied for 
the 11th-best in-dividual score at 18 over par, 
and Jensen fin-
ished in a tie for the 13th-lowest individual score at 20 over par.
Weather conditions and the 
opportunity to finish in first place on the last day of the tournament were a perfect simulation of fu-
ture tough and pressure-packed 
moments.
“You can’t really create this 
experience in practice,” Briles-Hinton said. “They learned a valuable lesson this week.”
Although the wind did affect 
the team’s play, it should not 
have been unfamiliar conditions 
to the Gators. 
“We’ve been playing in wind 
all season, so it was just a throw-
back to be here at home with all 
this wind,” Yadloczky said.
With this tournament act-
ing as motivation, UF will enter postseason play in the Southeast-
ern Conference Championship, 
which begins on April 17.
“This is definitely extra mo-
tivation heading into the SECs,” 
Briles-Hinton said.
“I think that sometimes a team 
will take two steps forward and 
have to take one step back to get better, and that’s what we will do.”
MEN FINISH TOURNAMENT IN 13TH:  
The No. 5 UF men’s golf team 
will enter the postseason follow-ing their worst performance of the spring season. 
The Gators finished the fi-
nal round of the U.S. Collegiate 
Championship in Alpharetta, 
Ga., in 13th place with a team score of 45 over par.
Clemson won the event with 
a score of 12 over par, 33 strokes better than the Gators.
Junior Tyson Alexander shot 2 
under par on Tuesday, but it was not enough to move up the lea-
derboard as the rest of the team 
shot a combined score of 27 over par in the final round.
UF GOLFWindy day ends Gators’ chances of finishing in first

Conference) and the Seminoles (29-12) at 
6 p.m.will have a little more meaning than it did last season, when the Gators won the 
doubleheader by a combined score of 20-5.
For Bruder, becoming more familiar with 
the in-state rivalry included a healthy dose of 
Tim Tebow and the UF football team.
“I know when I was watching the UF-FSU 
game, I was on my toes watching Tebow get all crazy, and that definitely makes me want to beat FSU just like they did,” she said. 
Sophomore second baseman Aja Paculba, 
another of the Gators’ eight native Califor-nians, said before last season’s matchup that it would take time to get as emotionally in-vested in the rivalry as her teammates. Now, 
Paculba has grown to appreciate the in-state 
competition, adding that a midweek game against the Seminoles will help the team stay focused for its weekend series at Kentucky.
“I don’t think we take it any different be-
cause it’s FSU,” Paculba said. “If it were any other team, I think it would be kind of like, ‘Oh it’s just a midweek game. Whatever.’ But because it’s FSU, it’s going to keep us in that 
focus for the SECs.”
Although most of UF coach Tim Walton’s 
players didn’t grow up on either side of the 
competition, they all understand its impor-tance.
“Florida State is Florida State. It’s a great 
rivalry,” Walton said. 
“As long as you’re going to school here, 
(the rivalry) means a lot to you. All you have 
to do is go to any sporting event — whether 
it’s soccer or football — you’ll know how im-portant it is and how important it is to win at home.”
In addition to defending its home field, 
getting out to a quick start will be critical for UF, as early momentum will be key in its first single-game matchup with FSU in the last four years.
Although the Gators have won their last 
four games against the Seminoles, the in-state rivalry always provides tough competition.
“FSU’s been playing really well this year, 
so I know they’re going to come out really strong,” Bruder said. “We’ve just got to stay 
on our toes, stay focused and not take any-
body for granted.”Quick start critical for one-game meeting
time, every single shot is a potential game-winner. If you truly care about a team, each shot by its opponent strikes fear in your heart, and each shot by your team gets your 
legs ready to jump for joy.
Almost every hockey game is close. A 20-point lead in 
basketball heading into the fourth quarter is all but in-
surmountable. Same with a 5-run lead in the bottom of 
the ninth inning or a three-touchdown advantage with 15 minutes left.
And here are two more words that should get you ex-
cited: playoff beards.
On the ice, a 3-0 lead at the onset of the third period is 
still a game. All it takes is three trips down the ice, and a 
comfortable lead becomes a nail-biter.
Now, I  know your reaction to me telling you to watch 
hockey might be the same reaction I had two days ago 
when a colleague tried to convince me to get into Turkish 
Süper Lig soccer. But I’m not asking you to follow teams in another country. Unless you count Canada.What will make the NHL playoffs more interesting is 
if you pick a team to cheer for. It doesn’t matter who you choose. The Vancouver Canucks. The Philadelphia Fly-
ers. The San Jose Sharks. If you were born and raised in 
Florida, the Panthers might sneak in this season.
Just pick a team and follow them. And if you have a 
high-definition television, that’s even better. No sport benefits more from high definition than hockey.
So, to summarize: Watch the NHL playoffs. It’s an ex-
hilarating experience if you just give it a try.
Alright, I did my best. You can stop reading now.EVAN , from page 14SOFT , from page 14per game over their last eight contests, and 
the top of the order has been especially con-sistent. 
O’Sullivan found his leadoff hitter when 
he moved den Dekker to the top of the line-up, and it now seems O’Sullivan has found his No. 2 hitter as well. Pigott has hit be-hind den Dekker in each of the last three games and logged his first career home run in the first inning against the Wildcats on Tuesday. 
While the offense is flourishing, the 
defense and pitching continue to be weak spots for UF, which will face off with UCF tonight at 6:30 in McKethan Stadium. 
Mike Mooney — who committed two 
errors against Bethune-Cookman — and Josh Adams have been the two shortstops 
to this point in the season, and though the pair has combined for 20 errors on the season, O’Sullivan says 
he’s sticking with the duo 
at shortstop. 
“It’s probably going to be one of those 
guys unless we can call somebody up from 
Triple-A,” he said. Senior starter Patrick Keating continued 
his struggles on the mound, giving up 6 
runs on seven hits in his 5 1/3 innings of work. 
The right-hander has been moved out of 
the weekend rotation and is being used pri-marily in relief and as a mid-week starter. 
“It’s not his stuff, it’s just his location,” 
O’Sullivan said. “Better location, better re-
sults. It’s as simple as that.”Keating’s struggles on mound continue against Bethune-CookmanBriles-Hinton

It has elements of Tae Bo, dancing and 
gymnastics all rolled into one.
It is nameless — for now — but it can’t go 
unrecognized.
What started as a time-killing dance in 
practice at the beginning of the season has 
evolved into a no-longer-behind-closed-doors dance routine between Melanie Sinclair and Corey Hartung.
Since the dance number’s infancy, the duo 
has added to the routine, proving it wasn’t just an alternative to thumb-twiddling in practice while waiting around.
“We did it at the meets because they play 
good pump-up music,” Hartung said. “So Mel and I are always, ‘Let’s go on the floor and do 
our dance.’ We’re always silly and playing 
around anyway.”
Perhaps it’s the dance itself, or Sinclair and 
Hartung’s attempts to keep a straight face dur-ing the dance, but it has caught on. 
Hartung said sometimes the other gym-
nasts just ask them to put on the show.
It’s a show that started spontaneously, but 
a show that requires the right beat. And yes, 
the beat is imperative. It can’t be too fast. It 
can’t be too slow. It has to be just right, and that means something that both Sinclair and Hartung can dance to, including “Wop” by J. Dash and “Womanizer” by Britney Spears.
UF coach Rhonda Faehn said she didn’t 
have anything like the dance when she was a member of the UCLA gymnastics team.“I think that we were almost too afraid to 
be acting like we were not focusing in the (bye rounds) or in the locker room,” Faehn said. 
While it’s not a custom she grew up with, 
she loves the notion of her team being comfortable and mature enough to have fun in the locker room and carry it out on the competi-tion floor. 
Sinclair said she doesn’t 
mind doing the dance at competitions. 
“I think it loosens me up 
because instead of sitting in the corner waiting and overthinking my skills, I’m doing some-thing that I enjoy doing,” she said.
And the twosome has put the routine on display at some significant venues, most re-
cently the NCAA North Central Regional 
Championship in Iowa City, Iowa, where the dance was caught on the video screen, and at the Southeastern Conference Championships.
“It just blossomed into this thing that we 
just do every meet now, over and over,” Sin-clair said. “Every time a good beat comes on, we’ll look at each other like, ‘It’s time.’”GATORS IN SESSION 1: On the heels of winning 
the NCAA North Central Regional Cham-pionship, the No. 5 UF gymnastics team will compete in Session 1 of the NCAA Champion-ships beginning April 16. 
There are two sessions, each consisting of 
six teams. The top three teams from each ses-sion advance to the Super Six competition, where the NCAA champion will be crowned.

The Santa Fe College softball 
team showed no mercy to St. 
John’s River Community College in a doubleheader Tuesday.
The Saints (41-5, 16-4 Mid-
Florida Conference) mercy-ruled the Vikings in both games, win-ning 8-0 each time.
“Two run-rule games are al-ways good, especially when they are conference games,” SFC coach Chris Ahern said. “We had 
a good contribution today from 
everyone who played. We used all our weapons. It was a total team effort.”
In Game 1, the Saints jumped 
on the Vikings early, putting up 1 run in the first inning compli-ments of a shot over the left-field fence by sophomore outfielder 
Lawna Hunter. 
Pitcher Kimberly Squires (21-
3) started the game off strong, striking out the first three batters 
she faced. 
She recorded six total strike-
outs in Game 1 with no runs on six hits.
Squires also helped herself 
out, going 2 for 4 at the plate with 
two RBIs.
SFC finished off SJRCC in the bottom of the fifth inning with 
a string of hits from sophomore outfielder Brittany Cannon, soph-
omore second baseman Nadirah 
Nesfield, Hunter and Squires that produced 4 consecutive runs. 
Hunter proved indispensable 
in the back-to-back games, going 4 for 8 at the plate and bringing home three runners.
The Saints kept the hits com-
ing in their second game of the 
afternoon. Sophomore shortstop 
Erika Garcia went 3 for 4 with two RBIs, and Cannon was 2 for 4 with one RBI.
Sophomore pitcher Ashley 
Schmitt (18-2) and freshman Ali 
Savage proved too much for the 
Vikings to handle, as they weren’t able to produce a run in the sec-ond game either.
Schmitt allowed three hits in 
five innings, and Savage finished the game with no hits in the top of the sixth.
“We came out strong on of-
fense and defense,” Schmitt said. “We just did great and kept it up both games.”
