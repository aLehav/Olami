Students found
safe after quake
ByCJ PRUNER
and ELIZABETH BERHMAN
Alligator Writers
After two days filled with uncer-
tainty in earthquake-shattered Haiti,
one UF student has returned home
and another is on his way.
Jon Bougher, a UF graduate stu-
dent, arrived in Miami Thursday
evening.
Roman Safiullin, also a UF grad-
uate student, was in the Dominican
Republic awaiting a flight to Miami
as of Thursday evening.
Bougher and Safiullin, who were
in Haiti filming a documentary about
a nonprofit organization, were in the
village of Little Africa, about 30 min-
utes south of the earthquake site,
when they felt the ground rumble.
The earthquake lasted about 30
seconds, Bougher said.
"At the end, you kind of heard
buildings crumbling and people
screaming," Bougher said.
With 40 minutes of battery life
remaining, Bougher and Safiullin
grabbed their video equipment.
They searched the community,
looking for collapsed builidings andsigns of local rescue efforts.
"The thing I remember the most
is the deeply, deeply religious peo-
ple throwing their arms in the sky,
praising Jesus and screaming in
tongues," Bougher said. "It was like
they were possessed."
Before the earthquake, Bougher
had never seen a dead body outside
of a funeral.
He saw a pastor who had been
killed by the falling rubble of his
own home.
His face looked
National like a rubber mask,
N ewS he said.
Bougher and
Safiullin interviewed a woman who
had stepped out of her tiny shop
minutes before the earthquake.
"She was just saying, 'Jesus save
me, Jesus save me, Jesus save me,"
Bougher said.
But surrounding the faith was
chaos.
Bougher and Safiullin headed to
the American embassy. After receiv-
ing little help there, they headed to
the airport in Port-au-Prince, where
they were separated.

By LYN KRAMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Zack Borer's music career began
with gigs in Gainesville. Now he has a
gig with Google.
Borer graduated UF with a busi-
ness degree in 2004. His song "That's
the Way" is preloaded on Google's
Nexus One, the latest Android smart-
phone.
Borer's management team said his
song is one of 13 preloaded on the
phone.
The phone became available Jan. 5.
Owners of the Google Nexus One can
click on "Music," find Borer's nameand play his song.
He has been compared to artists
like Kings of Leon and the Dave Mat-
thews Band.
Borer said he is
a traditional singer
and songwriter.
"I'm always
writing and coming
up with new ideas,"
he said.
He's also a proud
Borer Gators fan.
"Gainesville is
where I credit my start," Borer said.
"My two favorite things are my music
and the Gators."NATIONAL
Fake census e-mails sent
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
Susan Johnson is writing on behalf of the
Better Business Bureau of Northeast Florida
whether the Bureau wants her to or not.
Susan Johnson sent local residents e-mails
last week informing readers of how the Bureau
suggests people should avoid being conned by
fake representatives of the federal government
if those false workers come to collect "data" for
the U.S. Census Bureau.
Only no one knows who Susan Johnson is.
Johnson has no association with the Bureau,
and some of her claims contradict the Bureau's
real advice concerning potential con artists.
This is the fifth time Johnson has offered un-
solicited advice supposedly from the Bureau,
Tom Stephens, Bureau president, estimated.
"We have no clue who Susan Johnson is,"Stephens said, "and whether there is a Susan
Johnson at all."
In the e-mail, Johnson said Census work-
ers will only ask how many people live in each
home. In reality, the 2010 U.S. Census will ask
10 questions concerning age, gender and race,
among other personal information.
"We have no clue who Susan
Johnson is and whether there is a
Susan Johnson at all."
Tom Stephens
president of the Better Business Bureau
The font in Johnson's e-mail is bold, and dif-
ferent portions of her message are highlighted.
At the end, Johnson writes, "Please share this
info with friends and family" in red, capital let-

Gainesville man surrenders after 3 hour SWAT stakeout
A Gainesville man turned himself in to au-
thorities Thursday after Gainesville Police De-
partment and SWAT members coaxed him out
of a trailer they thought he was hiding in.
At about 9:10 a.m., police received a domes-
tic violence call from Candlelight Mobile Home
Park at 1600 NE 12th Ave., according to GPD
Capt. Ed Book.
The victim told police Dedrick Owens, 35,
assaulted her in their home and prevented her
from calling for help until she ran away to aneighbor's trailer, Book said.
After 3 1/2 hours of surveillance, police be-
gan receiving tips Owens had left and officers
were dispatched to wherever he might be, Book
said, adding police got a call from a member of
Owen's family who said they would find him
and bring Owens willingly to the station.
Owens turned himself in and was arrested at
about 1:20 p.m., Book said.
Owens bail was set at $85,000.

US job openings halved
By KAITLIN MULHERE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Andres Florez thought teaching was
a recession-proof profession -until he
started applying for jobs.
After sending his resum6 to countless
schools in Hillsborough County and inter-
viewing at four schools without a single
job offer, Florez changed his mind.
"e wasn't expecting it to be so hard,"
he said.
The 22-year-old graduated from UF in
May 2008 with a bachelor's degree in his-
tory and completed his master's degree in
social studies education in August 2009.
In early summer, as his degree's com-
pletion was approaching, Florez started
filling out applications. He didn't stop
until October when he was hired as a sub-
stitute teacher.
"Honestly, at first I was kind of an-
noyed," he said. "I thought if I worked so
hard in college I should be able to get a
job, but I had to get over it."
Florez is not alone in his struggle, ac-
cording to a survey released by the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics Tuesday, which
revealed job openings in the U.S. de-
creased about 50 percent since mid-2007.
In June 2007, the bureau reported 4.7
million job openings. By the end of 2009,
job openings for the nearly 15.3 million
unemployed people in the U.S. fell to a
record low 2.4 million.
The job-openings rate, or the number
of job openings as a percentage of total
employment, has remained at about 1.8
or 1.9 percent since March 2009, accord-
ing to the report.However, the steady rates hide a so-
bering statistic -there are about 6.4 un-
employed workers for every available job.
That number grew from 1.7 unemployed
people per position in December 2007, ac-
cording to the Associated Press.
"I thought if I worked so hard in
college I should be able to get
a job, but I had to get over it."
Andres Florez
U F gra d uate
Ja'Net Glover, assistant director for
career events at the UF's Career Resource
Center, said the center has felt the effects
of fewer job openings, particularly with its
semiannual career showcase on Tuesday
and Wednesday. Glover said the num-
ber of employers attending the career fair
decreased by about 15 to 20 percent from
last spring. Meanwhile, there has been an
increase in the number of students and
alumni attending the fair.
To combat the high competition and
the low number of job positions, Glover
suggests students take initiative and find
creative ways to set themselves apart
from others.
Florez's job search eventually paid off.
In January, he started teaching ninth- and
10th-grade geometry at a Tampa high
school.
Some time in the future, Florez would
like to teach what he really loves -his-
tory.
But for now?
"I'm completely happy teaching
math," he said.UF celebrates King's dream
* EVENTS WILL ALSO PAY TRIBUTE
TO HAITIAN EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
More than 40 years after his death,
Gainesville residents continue to cel-
ebrate the dream of Martin Luther King
Jr.
UF is preparing for a celebration hon-
oring King with events scheduled from
Monday until Jan. 29.
Natalia Leal, assistant director of UF
Multicultural and Diversity Affairs, said
the celebration's organizing committee
chose the theme "Leave Your Mark" to
return to the root of King's message.
The message emphasizes reaching
out to the community through service,
Leal said.
"Dr. King's legacy is really about so-
cial justice," she said.
The week's activities will start Mon-
day with a day of service at Reichert
House Youth Academy, an after-school
program created to help adolescent
males who could be exposed to drug
abuse and violence.
Reichert House Administrative Direc-
tor Doug Williams said he is pleased to
see students honor the holiday throughcommunity service, which will include
helping with landscaping and renova-
tions at the academy.
Other events include a commemo-
rative march Monday, which starts at
1 p.m. at the Bo Diddley Community
Plaza downtown, according to the event
Web site.
On Jan. 26, Dr. Ben Carson, a
neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins
University, will speak about
his career and his humble
beginnings in an inner-
city neighborhood, ac-
cording to the site.
T h e
Daye ve n s
will also
help pay
tribute to the victims of the earth-
quake in Haiti.
Leal said the celebration Monday
will feature appearances by members of
Gators United for Haiti.
The members will inform students
about how they can help the victims of
the earthquake, Leal said.
A candlelight vigil Tuesday night will
recognize both King's legacy and the
tragedy in Haiti.

'Cheery' thrift store
holds grand opening
0 THE STORE OPENED IN
DECEMBER.
By ERICA JOHNSON
Alligator Writer
A Gainesville real-estate in-
vestor's dream of transforming
an abandoned furniture store
into a charity thrift store has fi-
nally come true.
Kim Cinque said she first con-
sidered the idea while driving
past the former lonely building
with her husband, Craig.
Cinque then mentioned the
idea to Jennifer Anchors, execu-
tive director of Children's Home
Society of Florida, while at a
birthday party Cinque's son at-
tended.
Anchors welcomed the oppor-
tunity.
The Tot Spot Thrift Store, lo-
cated at 710 N Main St., opened
in December and will celebrate
its grand opening today from
5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.
All of the proceeds from the
Tot Spot go to the Children's
Home Society, which seeks to
end the generational cycle of
child abuse and neglect, Anchors
said.
"We want to ensure that every
child is safe, healthy, cared for, is
prepared for life and has a loving
family," she said.
Anchors said the thrift store
is especially important to the
Children's Home Society and the
community during tough eco-
nomic times.
The store sells clothing for ba-
bies, children and adults of all
ages. It also offers electronics,
toys and furniture.
But this thrift store, Cinquesaid, is different from others she
has seen.
"I wanted it to be bright, cheery
and fashionable," she said. "I
wanted the store to be less dreary
than most thrift stores, mommy-
friendly and more of a retail ex-
perience."
The highlight of the store for
Cinque, who designed the build-
ing's renovation, is the children's
play area in the center of the
store.
At the grand opening, there
will be a ribbon cutting, snacks,
door prizes and sales, Anchors
said.
"I wanted it to be bright,
cheery and fashionable.
I wanted the store to be
less dreary than most thrift
stores, mommy-friendly
and more of a retail experi-
ence."
Kim Cinque
creator of The Tot Spot Thrift Store
She said the Tot Spot is also
looking for student volunteers
to help with washing, organiz-
ing, tagging and displaying the
clothes. Volunteers ranging from
committed helpers to one-time
workers are welcome, Anchors
said.
Cinque, who attend the grand
opening, said she was humbled
by the project, yet proud of what
was accomplished at the same
time.
"It's been a real gamble -a
risk," she said. "I'm so excited to
see that my vision wasn't crazy,
and it is actually doing well for
the store."Students fight to name section

"When I found out that theywere allowing students to par-
take in the process, I knew I
wanted to help," UF senior
Clyde Darville said. "'Field
Flock' and 'The Rowdy Crowd'
are just a few things off the top
of my head."
Since opening in 1988, McK-
ethan Stadium at Perry Field is

STUDENT LIFE
On-campus residents go wireless
By MEGAN MCGARRELL
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF has cut the cord.
Students living in the Tolbert
and Graham areas and the Keys
Residential Complex are no longer
tethered to Ethernet cables for Inter-
net access in dorm common areas.
When students returned to UF
for the spring semester, they were
welcomed back with a new H-Net
wireless Internet system known as
the DHW network.
This is the second step of a three-
part installation program that began
with Hume Hall, Beaty Towers, Jen-
nings Hall, Broward Area and Yulee
Area last year.
The total cost of installing
wireless Internet in the dorms is
$600,000, which includes the cost of
the final phase of installation, said
Azfar Mian, director of Housing for
Administrative Services.
The wireless Internet, when allphases are complete, will give more
than 7,550 students wireless access
in their residence halls, Mian said.
The Springs and Lakeside resi-
dential complexes and Murphree
Area will have wireless access by
July 1, Mian said.
"I love to lounge."
Julice Ogando
a Yulee Hall resident
"The school sent out an e-mail
explaining that when we got back
on campus we would have a CD
waiting for us that would help us
hook up to the wireless," said Julice
Ogando, a Yulee Hall resident.
"I had no clue they were install-
ing wireless, and then suddenly we
got the message. And next thing I
knew we had access."
Ogando feels that the wireless
Internet is a natural decision and
that all of the dorms should have it
installed."I love to lounge," Ogando said.
"Having the wireless Internet al-
lows me to get away from my un-
comfortable desk chair in my room
and have somewhere else to access
the Internet from."
However, the dorm wireless is
not working perfectly for everyone.
Alex Arcentales, a Jennings Hall
resident, said he believes the wire-
less is slower than the wired con-
nection.
"I prefer to work at my desk
anyway, but I use the Ethernet cord
rather than the wireless in the com-
mon rooms because it runs faster,"
Arcentales said.
Even with the problems he has
experienced, Arcentales said he
feels adding the wireless Internet to
the dorms is a generally good deci-
sion.
"It is great that everyone has op-
tions," Arcentales said.
"It's nice to have the choice to
not be restricted by a wire."-Hume Hall

loud mouth Lane Kiffin is one person definitely not de-
serving of his very own day -just ask University of Ten-
nessee students.
He announced Tuesday that he'd be leaving the Vols
for his "dream job" as head coach at the University of
Southern California, which is pretty impressive consider-
ing he didn't fare that well in the NFL and didn't do much
at Tennessee other than run his mouth.
But, as much as we hate to do this we're going to throw
(very aggressively, mind you) a you-may-be-a-slimy-
douche-but-you-certainly- know-how-to-get-what-you-
want LAUREL to Lane Kiffin.
Kiffin wasn't the only one in front of a firing squad this
week.
Popular late night TV show host Conan O'Brien started
firing shots at NBC when it proposed giving former "The
Tonight Show" host Jay Leno the 11:35 p.m. time slot,
which would push O'Brien's show back to 12:05 a.m.
Since we are totally on team Coco -shirts will be made
soon -we're going to fling a you-do-realize-people-only-
watch-your-network-for-the-Office-right? DART at NBC.
And O'Brien isn't the only one sticking it to the man
lately.
But Google's man is a little bit bigger than Coco's man.
He's scarier too.
Regardless of size, Google decided to fight back after
Chinese computer hackers targeted the Gmail accounts of
20 Chinese human rights activists.
It said Monday it will no longer be censoring searches
for Google.cn, and there are talks that it may leave China
for good.
So naturally, we're going to throw a way-to-go-for-
sticking-it-to-those-commies LAUREL to Google.
Google and Conan aren't the only ones forming enemies.
Thursday's issue of the North Florida Herald included
a front-page column from Editor-in-Chief Ron DuPont.
He described an incident in which a reader removed
newspapers from a Herald box and threatened him.
Sure, it's easy to attack a small newspaper when you don't
agree with an editorial or two, but imagine if people all
over the country flew to New York to threaten Andrew
Rosenthal after The New York Times Editorial Board en-
dorsed Barack Obama for president?
The fact that readers might know the editor by name
doesn't make it OK to try to take away his First Amend-
ment right to publish editorials not everyone agrees with.
So in an act of solidarity, the Editorial Board is peeking
out from behind a shield to throw a we-newspapers-need-
to-stick-together DART at the High Springs area readers
who are harassing the North Florida Herald.
While we had a lot to complain about this week (what
else is new?), we would like to end on a positive note.
When an estimated 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit Haiti
and devastated the city of Port-au-Prince, UF students
along with the city of Gainesville, banded together to raise
money for relief efforts.
So we're going to graciously hand a we're-proud-of-
you-for-putting-down-your-smart-phones-and-helping-
out-those-in-need LAUREL to the Student Body.
That's all for this week folks. Keep up the good work.

Nwi -S~s ~ ~ertc
If we ignore them,
eople of UF: In my first official column as the Friday
columnist for the largest student-run newspaper in
the country, I want to touch on a very important is-
sue on campus -the provoking and condemning preach-
ers. This isn't a blanket statement for all preachers on
campus, but only those who are hatefully insulting for the
purpose of garnering attention.
Now, I understand that they're here for a reason. They
see young minds that can be molded into whatever they
want you to believe. They see the future contributors to
their congregations and the future believers of their true
faiths.
But, what they also see is a rebellious nature in the
students they preach to. Last week when I was waiting
for a class to start on Turlington Plaza, I saw a semicircle
gathering around a middle-aged man holding a Bible.
Then something surreal happened. A student charged into
him. The preacher, who somehow managed to stay on his
feet during the confrontation, was saved by the student's
friend who pulled him off saying, "Dude, he's like 50!"
Now, I can understand the student's frustrations. Ev-
ery day we are harassed by Turlington Plaza's infamous
preacher population who tell us that we're evil, homo-
sexual-loving fornicators damned to the fires of hell for
everything we do.
Last semester I was privileged enough to be interrupt-
ed from studying for a quiz while eating Chick-fil-A by
another born-again preacher. It was impossible to ignore
him because he sat down at my bench outside to talk to
me about a matter of utmost importance. So, I tried telling
him that I was Catholic, hoping that would make him real-
ize that I have a religion, and he should leave me alone.
Oh, how wrong I was. He proceeded to lecture me on
how being a Catholic is an evil, evil thing, and that the
Catholic Church doesn't even follow the Bible. I mean,
how could they be right when they don't believe in every*Fiv
they' 11I 'XA i
go away
single word in the Bible, despite the
scientific proof that the Earth is, in-
deed, much older than what Genesis
has you believe?
Instead of ignoring him, though,
I chose to argue and defend myself
Paul Murty against his falsehoods about my re-
letters@alligator org igon
This was a big mistake that all of
us make. We try to talk and argue
rationally with the irrational. The preachers on campus
and the Dove World Outreach Center don't know the first
thing about being rational, and no matter what we say we
will never convince them that tolerance and acceptance of
others is a good thing. We will never convince them that
Islam isn't actually of the devil and that it truly is the reli-
gion of peace.
By stopping on Turlington Plaza to engage them in
conversation, or simply just to listen, we give them the
support they need to continue coming back to plague our
beautiful campus. By not ignoring them when they con-
front us, we fuel their intolerant fires and invite them to
lecture us. And they love that. By marching to the Dove
World Outreach Center's "church" we give them too much
respect by letting them know that they bother us and that
they have some sort of power over our lives.
Instead, we should ignore them. We will never change
them, and they will never change us. But the difference
is, if the status quo remains, they will never stop trying.
They don't believe good deeds get them into heaven. They
believe converting others does, so they will stop at noth-
ing. So, people of UF: Stop arguing, stop listening, stop
marching and stop giving them the respect they don't de-
serve. Perhaps then we can finally be free of their hatred-
spouting on our beloved campus.

Guest column
Plenty of options for helping Haiti
e 7.0-magnitude earthquake that hit Haiti on
Tuesday is the worst to shake the country in 200
years, claiming the lives of up to 50,000 people
and affecting more than 3 million people world wide,
according to the American Red Cross. The disaster
has left a country already stricken with political insta-
bility, poverty and humanitarian conflict in an even
more devastating state. So, in the wake of the tragedy,
it's important for us to ask ourselves: What can we
do to help?
President Barack Obama addressed the crisis
Thursday. Speaking directly to the people of Haiti,
he said, "In this, your hour of greatest need, America
stands with you."
In order to stand with the people of Haiti, there
are many charities and relief organizations accept-
ing donations to provide immediate assistance. The
country is in such a state of shock that sending food
and clothes at this point is not the best way to help.
But by making donations to the following charities,
relief efforts can be sent most efficiently.
1. Text by text, the Red Cross has already raised
more than $3 million for relief. Text "HAITI" to
90-999 to donate $10. The Red Cross will focus efforts
on emergency food and shelter, and the money will
be added to your cell phone bill. You can also donate
at RedCross.org and track how much money is being
raised in each state across America.
2. To raise money for medical efforts, visit Amen-
Cares.org. AmenCares has already sent more than $5Ashley Ross million worth of disaster relief
modules, medical supplies andSpeaking Out emergency medicines to Haiti,
but more is needed. Visit the
Web site to make a donation
3. United Nations Children's Fund has been do-
nating money to Haitian children for years, but now
is when it's needed most. Visit UNICEF.org, where
100 percent of your donations will be used directly to
save the lives of children affected by the disaster.
4. Haitian-American rapper Wyclef Jean started a
foundation to rebuild Haiti and give immediate sup-
port. Text "YELP' to 501-501 to donate $5 to the cause.
The charge will be added to your next cell phone bill.
5. The International Relief and Development foun-
dation will focus on emergency needs like water,
sanitation and hygiene kits, medicines, and shelter
materials. Visit the ird-dc.org to make a donation.
6. Habitat for Humanity is taking donations in
hopes of providing the nation with affordable, safe
shelter for low-income families and all those in need.
To donate, visit habitat.org or call 1-800-HABITAT.
7. Doctors without Borders, an international medi-
cal humanitarian organization providing medical
attention for survivors and those threatened by the
catastrophe, is sending a fully equipped inflatable
hospital today to provide immediate care for the most
traumatic medical cases. Help send more doctors by
making a donation at doctorswithoutborders.org.

Families overjoyed with news of safety
STUDENTS,from page 1
"As soon as you got close to the [airplane] door you
started to get crushed," Bougher said. "To be honest, I
never knew, except for the UF championship last year,
what it was like to be trampled, and in that situation it
was just running through my mind."
Though Bougher was grateful for his safety, he ex-
pressed concerns for Haitian victims.
"I think when people start getting hungry, there's go-
ing to be a lot of madness in that country," Bougher said.
"I'm glad I got out when I did."
Relief flowed through the community when word
broke of the students' safety Thursday morning.
UT President Bernie Machen spread the news of the
students' safety in a statement to the UF News Bureau.
"It's a bright spot in the midst of a horrible tragedy,"
he said. "While we're thankful that Jon and Roman are
safe, we continue to keep the earthquake victims and
their loved ones in our thoughts."
In a separate statement, Machen also confirmed the
safety of two UT faculty members in Haiti, Florence Seg-
ile and Ed Handlon.
Churchill Roberts, co-director of the Documentary
Institute at the College of Journalism and Communi-
cations and the students' adviser, said he was relieved
to hear the students were safe. He sent them an e-mail
Tuesday, and, when he did not hear from them, he and
the students' peers began to worry.
"There was nothing I could tell the parents," Roberts
said. "That really bothered me.""Now that I know they're all right, I'm anxious to see
what their footage is like," he said.
Both students' families expressed relief.
Barbara Safiullin, Roman's stepmother, who lives in
Fort Lauderdale, was overjoyed to hear he was safe.
"We're just so excited," she said, adding he left her a
voicemail informing her he was safe. "We've been glued
to the TV for the past few days. It now feels like a huge
wave of relief."
"I'm glad I got out when I did."
Jon Bougher
UF graduate student
Sara Bougher, Jon's mother, described the depress-
ing days waiting for news. She, her husband and her
daughter all stayed home from work, anxious for any
news coming out of Haiti.
"He's alive, and that's all that matters," she said.
"We're so happy."
When she spoke to her son briefly Thursday after-
noon she didin't press for details about the earthquake.
"I wouldn't have asked him anyway," she said.
After talking to his mother, Jon Bougher burst into
tears, overwhelmed by his memories.
"In terms of hearing her voice, it was emotional for
me," he said. "I think it was the collective experience of
seeing dead bodies in Haiti and the emotional experi-
ence of being in the airport."

CENSUS, from page 1
ters, something, Stephens said, the Bureau would never do.
Stephens said he isn't concerned about the e-mails them-
selves, as most of the information sent from Johnson actually
aligns with what the Bureau previously said in a press release.
Although the Bureau has no official relationship with the
U.S. Census, Stephens said employees of the Census frequent-
ly send the Bureau information to pass along to anybody who
calls with questions.
Sometime after April 1, workers from the
National U.S. Census Bureau will begin traveling door
News to door to survey those who have not yet re-
turned their census. Students living on cam-
pus will be asked to complete a census in
Gainesville, even if a student is financially supported by a par-
ent living somewhere else.
"It's important students realize they have to fill out [a cen-
sus in Gainesville]," Sexton said. "If they don't, Gainesville will
be underrepresented."
Official U.S. Census workers will have an ID with a Depart-
ment of Commerce watermark. They will also give the Census'
regional office number to anybody seeking confirmation.
However, census workers will not ask for social security,
bank account or credit card numbers, according to a press re-
lease sent out last May by the Bureau.

No. 4 Tennessee edges Florida on late reverse layup
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
It took Angie Bjorklund nearly
40 minutes to score eight points,
half her season average.
It only took a reverse layup
with 2.3 seconds left in the game
to break the Gators' hearts.
Bjorklund's score gave No.
4 Tennessee a 66-64 lead, and
UF guard Lonnika Thompson's
three-point attempt at the buzzer
clanged off the rim to seal the
Vols' win in the O'Connell Center
on Thursday night.
"Our basketball team didn't
come here ready to play," UT
coach Pat Summitt said. "Florida
outplayed us the majority of the
game. We dodged a bullet."
The Gators (9-8, 2-2 Southeast-
ern Conference) rivaled the Vol-
unteers (15-1, 3-0 SEC) in most
statistical categories, but Tennes-
see's size was too much and UF
was outrebounded 46-24.
"We did everything that
we possibly could, except col-
lect a few rebounds," UF coachAmanda Butler said. "We lost a
ballgame that we should've won.
Playing Tennessee close was not
our objective tonight -it was to
win."
The Volunteers jumped out to
an 8-0 lead within the first three
minutes of the game, and Kel-
ley Cain made her first three at-
tempts, all in the paint.
Steffi Sorensen brought the
Gators back with three success-
ful three-pointers. Her last three-
pointer started a 9-0 run that gave
the Gators an early 15-14 lead.
The Gators limited their turn-
overs, which have been a problem
for them all season, in the first
half. After turning the ball over
four times in the first four min-
utes of the game, UF tightened up
and finished with 12 turnovers.
The Volunteers, who came
into the game with a season-high
18 turnovers, committed 11 in the
first half and finished with 25.
The Gators managed 15 points off
turnovers while Tennessee scored
15 off 13 fewer turnovers.

UF looks for first SEC win
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a be rry@a IIigato r org
This weekend could prove to be more
than just a chance for Florida to get its first
Southeastern Conference win after a shaky
start.
It's an opportunity for UF (11-5, 0-2
SEC) to fix its season-long problems, and
according to freshman guard Kenny Boyn-
ton, Saturday's 8 p.m. matchup against
LSU (9-7, 0-2 SEC) in the O'Connell Center
might be the time for the Gators to decide
their postseason fate.
"The first two losses in the SEC showed
us that it's serious and we can be beat.
Now, we've got to hunt teams instead of
being the hunted," Boynton said. "Earlier,
we were ranked, but now if we want to
make the tournament, I think we've got to
start from here."
For the first time under coach Billy
Donovan, Florida dropped its first twoSEC games, and it was due primarily to a
defensive breakdown.
UF gave up 95 points to Vanderbilt
and 89 to Kentucky -a far cry from the
team that gave up more than 70 points just
twice in its 14 non-conference games, both
of which came against teams ranked in the
top 10 at the time.
Although the Tigers,
averaging just 65.3 points
per game, don't have
nearly the same offensiveMe n's potential as the Commo-
Basketbal I dores or Wildcats, Dono-
van still sees cause for
concern in LSU's three
top scorers: forward Tasmin Mitchell (16.9
points per game), guard Bo Spencer (15.7)
and forward Storm Warren (13.8).
"I definitely think they're a physical
team up in the frontcourt with Storm War-
ren and Tasmin Mitchell," Donovan said.

Gators kick off home slate
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
After hitting the road for its season-
opener last week in Oklahoma, No. 8
Florida (0-1, 0-0 Southeastern Confer-
ence) will perform in the friendly con-
fines of the O'Connell Center for its SEC-
opener against No. 7 Arkansas (1-0, 0-0
SEC) Friday night.
The last time the Gators opened at
home against an SEC team, they came
away with a victory over LSU in 2004.
The team hopes for a similar result
against the Razorbacks, as it tries to re-
bound from a tough loss to the Sooners
when the Gators couldn't recover from a
rough start on the uneven bars.
But Florida won't have to worry
about early struggles on the bars this
week. As the home team, the Gators will
begin on the vault, where they scored a
49.30 in their strongest event in the sea-
son opener.
"It's really important for us to bounce
back," junior Alicia Goodwin said. "Ev-eryone knows what we're capable of out
there."
After working hard in practice all
week to fine-tune the details of their rou-
tines, the Gators hope to avoid the mis-
takes they made against Oklahoma.
"I expect them all to step up," UF
coach Rhonda Faehn said. "I think they
all did a very poor job [last week], in
terms of not going ag-
gressively."
Another thing that
will help the team
this week, and as the
season progresses, is
the experience gained
Goodwin by its freshman class,
which was ranked
No. 1 in the nation by CollegeGynFans.
com coming into the season.
In their season-opener, the Gators had
about half of their routines performed by
freshmen.
"They're just getting their feet wet,"
senior Amanda Castillo said.

Team needs Macklin to provide post presence
Vols erase deficit with
hot shooting after half
W HOOPS, from page 14
"It was like the ball was a hot potato," Summitt said.
"You got to give Florida credit. I really think they made
us rush."
The turnovers halted momentum for the Volunteers,
but they didn't erase it. Tennessee shot 36.7 percent in the
first half but shot a blistering 60.9 percent from the field
(14 of 23) in the second half.
Leading for the majority of the second half, the Gators
had a balanced attack with four players in double figures.
Sorensen led the team with 12 points, nine in the first half,
and three others tied with 10.
"I was just taking what the defense
was giving me," Sorensen said. "We
didn't get the stops or rebounds that we
need. That ultimately led to the loss."
Kelley Cain spearheaded the Vols'
offensive attack with 17 points and 10
rebounds despite leaving late in the first
Bjorklund half with a left hip injury. She came back
in the second half and contributed six points. Shekinna
Stricklen was second on the team with 14 points and was
the only other player in double digits.
The Gators offense was heavily dictated by guard
play.
Center Azania Stewart and Forward Sharielle Smith
combined for seven points and four rebounds.
"Do we leave here confident? Absolutely," Butler said.
"I think we came in here confident. We left the locker
room, even though it was a loss, knowing that we were
a better team."
The Gators will go on the road for their next SEC con-
test at Mississippi State on Sunday. The Bulldogs were
dismantled by the Volunteers 75-48 last Sunday.HOOPS, from page 14
"So I think defending around the
basket is going to be important, re-
bounding's going to be important
and I think the three-point line will
be important because of how well
Spencer can shoot it."
Much of the burden of defend-
ing down low will fall on junior
center Vernon Macklin, who has
struggled to even stay on the floor
so far in SEC play. Due to foul trou-
ble, Macklin played a combined 33
minutes in the first two conference
games and only scored 10 points.
With sophomore center Kenny
Kadji sidelined indefinitely with
a herniated disc in his lower back
and freshman Erik Murphy strug-
gling against the bigger, stronger
post players in the SEC, Macklin's
foul trouble has forced UF to play
a smaller lineup with Alex Tyus
and Dan Werner out of position.
"When Vern gets in foul trou-
ble, there's a noticeable difference
because of Kenny with his back in-
jury," Donovan said. "We all of a
sudden become a totally different-
looking team, size-wise, so maybe
it's a little more glaring for us than
other teams."
Unlike Vanderbilt and Ken-
tucky, LSU will not look to get into
a shootout with UF, as the Tigers'
smaller rotation makes them bet-
ter-suited to run a slowed-down,
half-court offense.
Having had a thin backcourt all
year and a frontcourt depleted by
injuries, Donovan can relate to the
lack of depth, but the Gators will

Faehn reiterated the fact the team isn't as
top-heavy with upperclassmen as in years
past, so there isn't much time for the fresh-
men to be eased into competition.
"They are our talent," Faehn said. "They
need to be out there."
The freshman talent includes Ashan6eDickerson, who turned in a 39.350 all-around
total against Oklahoma.
Being in front of a home crowd could do a
lot for the freshmen, as well as the rest of the
team. Since last season, Florida ranked fourth
in the nation in average home attendance, at
5,704 per meet.
"The fans we have here at Florida are
great," Castillo said. "When you have thou-sands of people screaming your name, you're
a lot more motivated to
do well and perform at a
higher level."
The Gators own the
Gymnastics series record against the
Razorbacks, 20-1, with the
only loss coming in last season's dual meet.
If the team hopes to continue its domi-nance over the Razorbacks, it's going to need
to feed off of the home crowd and perform at
a higher level.
"Coming away with a win this weekend
would be a definite confidence booster," Cas-
tillo said.
And a confidence boost could be what the
team needs to rebound after a rough start to
the young season.

UF TRACK AND FIELD
Gators ready to capitalize on productive offseason
By RYAN BUTLER
Alligator Writer
During the offseason, Christian
Taylor improved his squat from
225 pounds to 365. Now, the UF
jumper is looking for similar im-
provement when competing.
With this weekend's Kentucky
Invitational in Lexington, Ky., Tay-
lor and the men's and women's
track and field teams have their
first opportunity to show the re-
sults of their offseason work.
"This was one of the best falls
we've ever had," UF coach Mike
Holloway said. "They're tired of
seeing each other and ready to see
where their effort gets them."
The men's team enters the sea-
son ranked second in the first pollby the United States Track & Field
and Cross Country Coaches As-
sociation (USTFCCCA) after its
second-place finish in last season's
NCAA Indoor Championship. The
women's team is ranked sixth.
Opening the indoor track and
field season for the second-straight
year at the Kentucky Invitational,
the Gators are more concerned
with monitoring their progress
than recording their best times.
"You do what you can do, and
you see who else is out there and
what the team looks like," Taylor
said.
After winning the NCAA In-
door triple jump title last season,
Taylor's offseason work could
make him one of the most success-
ful athletes in the sport.So could former Arkansas
coach Dick Booth. Booth joined UF
this summer after 27 years with
the Razorbacks, where he coached
athletes to 45 in-
dividual national
championships
and tutored 11
Olympians. He
will serve as
jumps coach and
recruiting as-
sistant with the
Gators and sets
Taylor up for an even better 2010
season.
"I feel a lot better and I have a
lot more confidence with Booth,"
Taylor said.
Joining Taylor at the Kentucky
Invitational on the women's side isMariam Kevkhishvili. The senior
shot-putter won both the NCAA
Indoor and Outdoor Champion-
ships last season and will be using
2010 to cement herself as one of the
best in the sport's history. She is a
preseason finalist for The Bower-
man Award presented to the best
men's and women's track and field
athlete by the USTFCCCA.
"I want to get out there and do
my best and leave my name for
as long as possible," Kevkhishvili
said.

"I think we've progressed men-

Florida takes on Florida Atlantic without key swimmers
0 NINE FROM THE MEN'S SQUAD
WILL BE AT THE SMU CLASSIC.
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
After coming back from winter break last
weekend with a host of individual awards, the
UF men's and women's swimming and diving
teams will try to keep the momentum going as
they take on Florida Atlantic on Saturday at 1
p.m. in the O'Connell Center.
Last year, both squads topped the Owls ina dual meet, but the Gators will be without
several swimmers on the men's side.
Senior Shaune Fraser and eight other mem-
bers of the squad will be absent from the meet
as they will be competing in the SMU Classic,
hosted by Southern Methodist University in
Dallas.
Last year, the men's team placed second in
the event, which begins today.
With Fraser and the more versatile swim-
mers in Dallas, the rest of the men's team will
get to compete against FAU.
The results of the FAU meet can have a
large impact on who coach Gregg Troy wantsswimming come the postseason.
"It gives everyone on the team the chance
to race this week," Troy said.
Florida collected its fair share of individual
awards this week.
After taking care of both
Indian River State College
and LSU in dual meets
Swimming last weekend, three Gators
earned weekly swim and
dive honors, and one took
home a top UF award.
Fraser was named CollegeSwimming.
com's Division I National Collegiate MaleSwimmer of the Week for his performance last
weekend.
This marks the third time this academic
year Fraser has earned the honor after being
awarded Oct. 14 and Nov. 3 as well.
Also takinghonors for lastweekend's meets
were senior diver Kara Salamone, named the
Southeastern Conference Female Diver of the
Week, and freshman men's swimmer Marco
Loughran who earned SEC Male Freshman of
the Week.
"They all had great weeks," Troy said. "It's
a good indication of where they're at right
now."
