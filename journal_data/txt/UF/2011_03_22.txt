Her father’s childhood play-
ground was in ruins. 
The swing set 20-year-old Mer -
cedes Farhat saw in 2008 while vis-
iting her father’s family in Tripoli, 
Libya, was a metal skeleton. Graf-
fiti covered a fountain. It was noth-ing like the lovely memories he shared with her.
She said she saw more than a 
run-down playground during that trip. She saw a run-down country.
The fight to remove Libyan 
leader Muammar Gadhafi has put 
Farhat’s family in a difficult posi-
tion. There’s 
a thin line she must walk, a line between w a n t i n g 
change and supporting a man who holds so much power over her family and her future.
The Gadhafi government, she 
said, monitors everything from phone calls, emails, even articles with her name in it.
She’s a Libyan Olympic swim-
mer. Gadhafi’s son is the head of the Olympic committee. She com -
peted for Libya in 2008 and wants to compete again.
“So there’s so much hidden lan-
guage,” said Farhat, a UF biology junior.
Her father will call her aunts 
and uncles in Tripoli. In Arabic, her father will say, “Oh yeah, Gad-hafi’s great,” because he knows no 
conversation is private.
After U.S., France, Britain and 
other forces attacked Gadhafi’s 
forces in Tripoli on Saturday, Far -
hat’s aunt, who works for the Liby-an government, told her father that everyone is safe and life is normal.“I’m sure that when they say 
life’s normal, that doesn’t mean it’s 100 percent fine,” she said.
She’s probably right, said Mat-
thew Jacobs, a UF history profes-sor who teaches a course in U.S.-Middle East relations.
He said a lot of people are look-ing at Libya and asking how the 
conflict will affect American poli-
tics. 
The bigger concern, Jacobs said, 
is how the conflict will affect the Libyan people.
“There’s very real hardships,” 
he said about life in Libya. “There’s the hardship of living in a country 
that is approaching civil war. Then 
there’s the hardship of the regime trying to maintain control and clamping down.”
Then there’s the biggest con-
cern: civilian casualties.
“People are going to die,” he 
said. “We can’t look past that.”
Gadhafi has stated that he will 
not give up his power peaceful-ly, and many people believe his threat.
“I think he’s going to go by vio-
lence if he goes,” said Leonardo Villalon, director of UF’s Center for African Studies.
Farhat said she isn’t worried. 
Not yet.
She said she did not pay any 
more attention to international politics than the next student, at least not until her family was af-fected.
“This is the first thing that I’ve 
paid attention to at all,” she said.
She’s paying close attention to 
the news, but she said she isn’t 
scared. It hasn’t distracted her 
from her upcoming physics exam.
Despite many things, including 
the neglect of the country’s pub-lic spaces, low wages and intense government control, she didn’t expect anyone to rebel because the government monitors everything. She said she certainly did not ex-pect the U.S. and other nations to bomb her father’s country.
“I’m surprised that this start-
ed,” she said.“Even now.” 
Authorities say woman drove off with police car in Riviera Beach
RIVIERA BEACH — Authorities say a 
Florida woman who was handcuffed by po-
lice and placed on the back seat of a patrol car managed to drive off in the cruiser, crashing it blocks away.
Police in Riviera Beach said Monday that 
officers responded to a weekend call of a possible sexual assault, but the woman who complained appeared to be suffering from a mental illness. 
Authorities say police were still inves-tigating Sunday afternoon when the hand-cuffed woman squeezed through the window to the front seat and drove off, crashing into a pickup truck soon after.
Both the woman and pickup driver were 
taken to a hospital, but the extent of any inju-ries was not clear. 
It’s unclear what charges the woman 
might face.

Libyan crisis reverberates in UF community

UF’s teachers union is in jeopardy of being 
decertified and having its collective bargain-
ing rights revoked. 
The Florida House of Representatives and 
the Senate are reviewing bills to lessen the 
collective bargaining rights of unions.  
The Senate also passed a bill to eliminate 
teacher tenure for those hired after July 1. 
In addition, the bill would base teacher pay largely upon the performance of students.
Susan Hegeman, the United Faculty of 
Florida’s UF chapter membership chairwom-an, called the new proposals a “dramatic as-sault on unions.”“A lot of conservative lawmakers see 
unions as the last remaining threat to their power,” Hegeman said.
She is concerned that if the union is decer -
tified and its collective bargaining rights ter -
minated,  conditions governing employment at UF will be left strictly up to the university. 
“As to whether they will be willing to take 
into consideration faculty needs,” Hegeman said, “I do not think that they will.”
In order to maintain protection from the 
new legislation, Hegeman said that UFF-UF must increase its current membership by 
about 30 percent. 
According to Hegeman, new legislation 
calls for decertification of those unions with 
less than 50 percent faculty membership.  In order to increase membership, UFF-UF members have created a Facebook page, started talking with non-union faculty and begun handing out fliers.  
In speaking with non-
union faculty members, Hegeman said rejections to participating in the union usually stem from a lack of understanding of how the union works, a general dis-
dain for unions or a desire to not pay membership fees.  
Hegeman said many are 
under the mistaken impression that their col-lective bargaining rights will remain in place even if the union is decertified. A Feb. 23 Gal-lup Poll indicated that 61 percent of Ameri-cans wouldn’t support legislation similar to that proposed in Wisconsin, where legislators have proposed cutting union rights and mak-ing state employees pay more into their re-tirement benefits. 
In a March 1 email sent to UF faculty 
members, Hegeman said if the UFF is decerti-
fied, then the collective bargaining agreement 
would be “null and void.” She explained that the collective bargaining agreement is re-sponsible for tenure, promotion policies, paid parental leave and provides protection from arbitrary or discriminatory dismissal.

Lance Cpl. Dakota Hicks connects a radio battery to a Solar Portable 
Alternative Communication Energy System at Patrol Base in Sangin District, in Afghanistan. on Dec. 31, 2010.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. — The Marine Corps is 
going green to save lives rather than to save the planet.
In a renewable energy strategy revealed to troops 
Monday, the service said it plans to equip thousands 
of Marines in Afghanistan with solar-powered gadgets 
over the next year in an effort to decrease the need to 
make risky runs for fuel through enemy territory.
The Marine Corps said the change comes after the 
service studied a three-month period last year and found that one Marine is wounded for every 50 trips made for fuel or water in Afghanistan.
The strategy also addresses the ongoing problem of 
U.S. reliance on the questionable practices of private security companies in Afghanistan that are used to 
protect the convoys. A congressional inquiry last year 
found that some of those companies have been inadver -
tently funneling money to the Taliban and threatening the safety of coalition troops because contractors often don’t vet local recruits and wind up hiring warlords and thugs.
Trucking contractors who bring in the fuel, mostly 
from Pakistan, pay tens of millions of dollars a year to local warlords for convoy protection. Marines then 
truck the fuel from their bases to the smaller outposts.
The green strategy builds on the initial success of 
a Marine company wrapping up the final weeks of a 
seven-month deployment to a Taliban stronghold. 
The unit is equipped with portable solar panels for 
recharging radios and laptops and solar-powered gen-erators for running combat operations at its remote out-posts.
“The immediate impact is our war fighters are safer 
today than they were yesterday,” said Col. Robert J. Charette Jr., director of the Marine Corps’ Expedition-ary Energy Office in Washington.
The Corps plans to spend $9 million to equip Ma-
rines deployed to Afghanistan with portable solar pan-els by 2012, he said. 
It wants to increase the number of solar-powered generators there from nine to 300 by December 2012.
The service is also using PowerShade, a large solar 
tarp that fits over a standard Marine Corps tent that can quietly power its lighting system without the buzz of a generator that can alert insurgents, and the Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy System, a solar panel array that can run a platoon-sized command center.
The Obama administration is asking Congress for 
$41 million to implement the measures next year and proposes investing another $322 million by 2016.
With oil prices soaring, Charette is optimistic Ma-
rines will secure the funding amid the budget crunch.
The Marine Corps consumes more than 200,000 gal-
lons of fuel per day in Afghanistan.
The strategy is part of a military-wide goal of reduc-
ing the carbon footprint of the single largest U.S. energy consumer. 
Hundreds of bases are switching to renewable en-
ergy while plans are under way for everything from a “green” Navy carrier strike group run completely on alternative fuels to a fleet of electric powered Army ve-
hicles.
The corps aims to cut its energy con-
sumption overall in half by 2025.
“The amount of equipment we’ve 
acquired throughout the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan 
has been exponential,” 1st Lt. Gregory A. Wolf said. “It 
has made us more lethal but has made us unsustainable down the road.”
In October, the Marine Corps sent in 150 Marines 
to Afghanistan’s toughest area — Helmand Province’s Sangin district — with an array of solar-powered equip-ment, including solar blankets, called Solar Portable Alternative Communication Energy System, or “SPAC-ES,” that can be stuffed in a backpack.
The troops were told to use the panels to charge 
their radio batteries. But once deployed, they learned the panels could be used for other equipment.
The Marine Corps now is asking private industry to 
develop even smaller, more efficient solar power tech-nologies to help the force become more agile.Marines go green in Afghanistan

Rob Zeller and Susan Bottcher 
admit that they don’t agree on 
everything. 
One of them views govern-
ment as a pesky, bloated body 
that hinders economic prosper -
ity. The other views its programs 
as something to be embraced, not 
automatically sent to the chop-ping block.
“We’re different on almost ev-
ery issue,” Zeller said.
Those differences were high-
lighted at an African American Accountability Alliance forum Monday night. 
About a dozen people listened 
to the candidates and voted on who they wanted to represent them in the District 3 run-off, 
slated to take place April 12.
At the end of the forum, Bot-
tcher secured the endorsement.
She said the endorsement will 
help connect her with the Afri-can-American community if she 
is elected.
During the debate, Bottcher, the stay-at-home mom and com-munity activist-turned-candi-date, pledged to attend every neighborhood meeting as a com-missioner.
“I will be the only full-time city commissioner,” she said.
Zeller, who owns several bars 
and restaurants in Gainesville, said almost all of the current commissioners have jobs.
“I think productive people 
have jobs,” he said in an inter -
view. “I don’t think that’s a hin-drance nor a help.”
Zeller criticized the current 
commission, saying it has placed burdens on citizens in the form of the fire assessment fee and other regulations.
He also said commissioners 
seem to be distracted, using their laptops and posting on Twitter during commission meetings.
“I don’t think the current com-
mission is paying attention to the citizens,” he said during the forum.
Bottcher, who supports the 
current commission, said it has 
been doing well, and various 
quality-of-life ratings and awards demonstrate that.
“What more do you need to 
show to demonstrate that we are on the right track?” she said in an interview. “Either he isn’t paying attention or he is playing into the political rhetoric.”4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 2011

“Come together … right now” for 
the Reitz Union Board Entertainment’s 
Beatlemania week. 
UF students have the opportunity 
to experience life in the ‘60s and ex-
press their love for The Beatles this week.
First, “Nowhere Boy,” a film about 
the untold story of John Lennon and the creation of The Beatles, will be playing tomorrow and Thursday in 
the Reitz Union Cinema.
RUB will host the actual “Beatle-
mania” event in the Reitz Union Rion 
Ballroom on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. 
Students will have the opportuni-
ty to tie-dye a shirt, compete in “The Beatles: Rock Band,” decorate a record and test their Beatles knowledge to 
win prizes. 
Glenn Rickard, UF instructor for 
the Rock ‘N’ Roll and American Soci-
ety course, will be discussing impor -
tant points in Beatles’ history.
Rickard said there is so much more 
to The Beatles than what people real-ize.
“Bottom line, they are just good,” 
Rickard said. “Their quality and talent is undefinable.”
Finally, The “Shoddy” Beatles, a 
local Beatles cover band, will be per -
forming at Orange & Brew on Thurs-
day at 8 p.m. RUB Entertainment realized hav-
ing more “branded” associations with 
themes would be much better received by the Student Body, said Amy Casal-
etto, president of RUB Entertainment.  
Taking people’s affinity for The 
Beatles into consideration, they 
thought an awesome week full of 
Beatles-related  events would excite 
UF students.
Last semester, RUB Entertainment 
put on a Harry Potter-themed event, “Halloween at Hogwarts,” because 
they expected that such an event 
would cater to a very large audience, 
according to Jenna Duf-ficy, director of promo-
tions for RUB Entertain-
ment.
“The Beatles is a musical group 
that has influenced our parents, us, and even the music we listen to to-
day,” Dufficy said.
According to Dufficy, The Beatles’ 
music is able to transcend the gen-
erations because of what they wrote 
about: love, hate, war and peace.
Such broad subjects allowed their 
music to apply to not only our par -
ents’ generation but also to ours as we 
are dealing with similar issues.
“A lot was going on politically, 
economically, socially and culturally during those times, and I feel there are a lot of similar issues now that we 
as young adults deal with on a day-
to-day basis, and because of that, we can have a good connection with that generation,” Casaletto said.
All you need is love for the good 
music to enjoy the different Beatlema-nia events this week, she said.Beatlemania takes

When planning this year’s spring fes-
tival for the UF Japanese Club, Andrea 
Powell figured the event would be rela-
tively similar to previous years.
There would be booths highlighting 
different aspects of Japanese culture. Club members would perform tradition-al and modern Japanese dances.
The festival would have the same goal 
it has year after year: to promote the Jap-anese way of life.
Then the earthquake hit.After an 8.9-magnitude quake struck 
off the coast of northeast Japan, causing mass devastation, the club members re-evaluated the purpose behind the event.
Powell, president of the club, said 
the focus is now on creating awareness 
about the situation in Japan.  
The event, which will be held on 
March 26 from   noon to 5 p.m. on the 
Reitz Union Colonnade, has also turned 
into a  fundraiser.  While there is no cost 
for admission, attendees will have the opportunity to donate to disaster relief efforts.
Other activities planned for the event 
include a traditional tea ceremony and fashion show featuring Japanese cloth-ing.
Lauren Sorondo, public relations 
chairwoman for the club, said she hopes people who attend the event will be en-couraged to learn about different ways they can help the Japanese people.
She and Powell were together when they heard the news about the earth-quake.
“It was like my stomach plummeted 
and twisted into a knot as soon as we saw the tsunami images,” she said.
Sorondo, an English literature major, 
joined the club her freshman year. She believes it’s important to learn about other cultures in order to create interna-tional friendships and foster greater un-
derstanding between human beings.
Powell, a Japanese and political sci-
ence double major, became active in 
the club after attending the festival last 
year.  
She plans to study abroad in Japan for 
both the fall and spring semesters next 
year.  
She doesn’t think the earthquake will 
affect her plans, but it has made her aware that disaster can strike anywhere, at any time.
She became interested in Japanese cul-
ture in high school, when she used the coun-try as a theme for a series of art projects. She said she hopes the festival will help students understand and appreciate the differences between Japanese and American culture.Festival to raise awareness

Since the 1990s, Trey Parker and Matt Stone have 
made their buck throwing everything from the sa-
cred to the unmentionable under the comedic bus. 
They have taken on topics ranging from Scientology to the Shake Weight and everything else in between. 
Now they’re taking one of their favorite punching 
bags to Broadway.
In a phone conference with college reporters 
Monday, Parker and Stone, known mostly for their work as the creators of “South Park,” discussed their latest work, a Broadway musical about Mormon mis-
sionaries.
“The Book of Mormon,” which is set to premiere 
Thursday, tells an outlandish story of two missionar -
ies who are sent to Uganda to spread their message. 
Unlike one of their episodes, which they said they 
create in a week’s time, the musical has been in the 
works for seven years. Putting on a musical that goes on for more than two hours presents a completely different challenge than producing a 22-minute epi-
sode
“A five-paragraph essay is completely different 
from the book,” Stone said.The topic is not an unfamiliar one for the duo. 
Growing up in Colorado, the two interacted with 
Mormons on a frequent basis. They have also done a “South Park” episode that pokes fun at the church, using a jingle throughout the episode to lampoon 
Joseph Smith, the church’s founder who Mormons 
believe interacted with God and Jesus Christ. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
which has been mostly tight-lipped on the matter, 
has issued a brief statement ad-
dressing the musical.
“The production may attempt 
to entertain audiences for an eve-
ning,” the statement reads, “but 
the Book of Mormon as a volume of 
Scripture will change people’s lives 
forever by bringing them closer to Christ.” 
Despite the musical’s irreverent tone, Parker 
and Stone said their fascination with Mormonism isn’t grounded in any spite, calling members of the church “super nice.” They said they don’t expect devout Mormons to come, but said many practicing 
Mormons will enjoy the show, noting that some of 
the positive feedback they have received at sneak-peek performances has come from Mormons.Mormon musical hits broadway
Committee, disagrees with the assertion that the university’s 
administration will not take into consideration the members of its faculty. 
“We still have rights and freedom of speech,” Bolton said. Bolton, who has been teaching at UF for 25 years, said it’s 
her opinion UF will do all it can to retain good faculty mem-bers and to keep them happy. She said the faculty at the uni-versity are valuable human resources. 
“The great majority of upper-division ad-
ministration realizes that you cannot expect to have a four-star, flagship institution unless you have good human resources,” Bolton said. 
As a professor teaching under the Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences, Bolton is not eligible to participate in 
UFF. However, Bolton said that if given the choice she would 
still choose not to participate in the union. 
Bolton said the initial intent of unions was to protect work-
ers’ rights, but she believes now unions only serve the inter -
ests of those protected by them.
“I believe unions have veered far from their goal,” Bolton 
said. “The practice has been corrupted.” Another bill eliminates 
tenure for new teachers

“When am I ever gonna use this crap?” go hand in hand. Elective requirements in high school may seem 
like funny time wasters (I carried a fake baby around for a week and loved every second of it), but as we neared 
graduation, we looked forward to the end of electives 
and fixed our gazes on more serious coursework that was actually relevant to a topic and career we chose. Alas, upon arriving at college we found ourselves tak-ing only a handful of relevant tracking classes and del-egating the rest of our time to the same lectures on the Declaration of Independence and the Holocaust we’ve heard since first grade. College general education classes are nothing more than the same classes we’ve taken for 
years recycled with different course titles. And here’s the 
kicker: Unlike high school electives, which were easily navigated with minimal to no effort, the ones in college are actually difficult! 
Sure, there are exceptions to every rule, but generally, 
I have found myself studying just as much for my Gen. Ed. classes as I have for my major courses. No longer an excuse to goof off, these collegiate forms of electives require so much time that they detract from hours that 
need to be devoted to courses that count toward a ma-
jor. In my humble opinion, this is just silly. I understand the purpose of these requirements is to promote “well-roundedness,” but when it’s causing my grades to slip in courses that carry much more weight on a resume, I get a little upset. General education classes should be just that: general. They should be simple, perhaps even enjoyable overviews on random topics that require a reasonable amount of work that students leave with more knowl-
edge of an ancient culture or plant species. By the time 
students reach college, the light at the end of the tunnel is no longer dim and we are anxious to hunker down and power through to that bachelor’s degree. Majors are picked, studying gets serious and nobody can afford to waste time. However, an English major learning about genetic en-gineering of plants or geometric algorithms is a big waste. Herein lies the paradox: If a student re-
ceives anything other than an 
A in a Gen. Ed. class, it reflects poorly on the student due to the fact that these classes are sup-posed to be, well, general and 
simple, so they have to devote valuable hours to them in order to succeed. Of course, college is supposed to be challenging, but I want to devote my time to specializing in a subject that will actually aid me in life, not to a scat-
tering of topics that will only be useful in trivia. 
UF requires 36 general education credits divided up 
among a variety of subject areas. Using 12-credit semes-
ters, that equals three more semesters a student spends at UF than if they were to only take courses to achieve a major. While the university may enjoy the money we shell out to take these bothersome classes, I do not enjoy the hours I spend preparing for a year and half of extra classes. 
In the work place, general education classes prove 
wasteful of resources and time. European countries, ev-er-so-efficient, recognize the futility of these extra classes and sport an education system that allows students to apply for a program of their choice and focus on a subject area. Thus, while perhaps less valuable in a game of Triv-ial Pursuit, European students emerge from school better equipped and area-focused than Americans who spend four years subject-hopping. Perhaps American universi-
ties will get it together in the future, but for now, UF can 
enjoy 36 extra hours worth of my money as I  once again learn about Stonehenge and Thomas Jefferson.

Gators fans should avoid 
religious jabs
After a weekend that saw numerous power -
houses get smacked down by teams ranging 
from the Spiders to the “whointhehell?”, the 
Gators lived up to expectations and their inflated seed-ing, pounding the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos to within an inch of their lives before sliding by UCLA and into the Sweet 16 (or the “fourth round” for those unwilling 
to infringe on new tradition grounded in irrationality.)  
Next up: the Brigham Young University Cougars, a team 
that has captured America’s curiosity in large part to a coldblooded crossover machine that many sports fans simply refer to as “The Jimmer.” For UF fans, the game 
should hold a lot of meaning as it was this very team 
that sent the Orange and Blue packing after a heart-breaking double-overtime slugfest one year ago. If there wasn’t enough excitement to kill a schoolyard of chil-
dren, sportscaster Gus Johnson will be in New Orleans 
to deliver his aneurysm-inducing play-by-play. Huzzah!  
Unfortunately, these things will get lost this week as Inter -
net trolls, barstool intellectuals and overzealous diehards take aim at BYU’s religious tradition and culture in an ef-
fort to provide a cheap laugh. Although these rhetorical 
sucker-punches are nothing new for the university, which is owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they have recently become more fero-
cious and commonplace following the suspension of BYU 
forward Brandon Davies, who violated of the school’s honor code by having premarital sex. While this develop-ment provides a favorable matchup for the Gators’ front-court, it also gives the insensitive and the asinine more 
mud to throw around in their pigpen. 
We ask you, the Gator faithful, not to take that head-
first dive into the slop.
Although we acknowledge that the school’s require-
ments may appear as nothing more than theological 
overkill for the majority of students, it is inappropriate for us to cast a moral judgment on another university’s practices. In regard to the Davies episode, while the con-cept of losing one’s playing privileges over a bedroom 
matter between two consenting adults is mind-boggling 
for most, the fact is that a player broke a team policy, one that he and every BYU player signs before putting on a uniform, and the coach and university decided 
to handle it their way. For that, we cannot fault them.  
In terms of the bigger picture, Thursday’s game is a 
matchup between the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds in the South-east Region, not between Sodom  and Gomorrah and the Promised Land. The game will come down to whether 
the Gators will be able to contain Noah Hartsock, Jackson 
Emery and their pesky point guard, not whether they can convert them. 
While lighthearted swings at the Mormon faith may not 
come close to the same dirt-high level of burning scriptures or using a higher power’s name to justify the desecration of the memory of fallen soldiers, it’s still religious bigot-ry. These are human beings, some of whom you may be cheering alongside with on Thursday (Yes, there are Mor -
mons in The Gator Nation). It’s fine to have qualms with 
their doctrine, but leave it in the pews come tip-off time.  
Otherwise, you can just Fredette about it.

Letters to the Editor
Columnist’s rhetoric does little to defend bill
The rhetoric used by Zack Smith in Monday’s column  is over -
used and deceptive. Sadly, however, it tends to work. He starts by  
paraphrasing a Senate bill in a favoring light, noting that it 
supports critical thinking. It’s a platitude: How can anyone not support critical thinking? Oh, but wait, those evil Democrats 
and the American Civil Liberties Union don’t support the bill. 
They must not support critical thinking! It’s an irony lost on most Tea Partiers, I’m sure. He continues with appeals to au-thority, mentioning many scientists for an argument that most-ly amounts to nothing.
Senate Bill 1854 was put forward by Stephen Wise, a senator 
who just over a year ago put forth a bill to introduce intelligent design in schools. It was struck down. He comes now with a bill that is less strongly worded and is filled with other curri-
cula requirements to disguise its actual purpose.
The very first provision in the bill requires critical 
analysis of evolution. Why evolution? Why not grav-
ity as well? Why not something that has less scientific consensus? No other scientific theory is mentioned. If the intent of this bill wasn’t obvious, it should be now.  
The rest of the bill requires teaching things that are already taught in the curriculum. Essentially , the only thing that will change is that teachers are required to be critical of evolution.
Not only should this bill not be passed due to its blatant 
anti-evolution bias, but it should be struck down to show that we don’t want this vacuous crap in the Florida Senate.
Chad Kimes 
5EGEvolution constant subject of critical evaluation
Charles Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species” was published 
in 1859, and the theory that life on Earth is in a constant state of evolution was around even before that. What columnist Zack Smith seems unable to grasp is the fact that the theory of evolu-tion has, in fact, been subject to “critical analysis” for 150 years 
and has been proven every time.
The theory of intelligent design, which Smith acknowledges 
the sponsor of this bill “probably favors” (though Smith calls 
it “creationism” — get with the program, Zack; it hasn’t been called that since the Supreme Court shot it down in the 1980s), has only been around as a cohesive theory since 1984, though variations of it go back centuries. It has been subject to “critical analysis,” in its current form for 25 years, and in its prior form for decades.
But while evolution has held up under repeated scientific 
scrutiny , the central tenet of intelligent design, the concept of “irreducible complexity,” has failed every scientific test — ev-ery “critical analysis,” if you will — it has undergone.
I have no problem with bringing students up to date on the 
valid, scientific, “critical analysis” of both evolution and intel-ligent design, since such a curriculum would clearly show evo-lution to be valid science and intelligent design to be religious dogma with a thin layer of pseudo-scientific veneer thrown 
over it. But what this bill, like others struck down before it, 
seeks to do is present intelligent design proponents’ junk sci-ence against evolution and in favor of intelligent design, claim-
ing it to be equal to rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific investiga-
tions over the past 150 years which have shown evolution to be fact and intelligent design to be bunk.That’s not “critical analysis” —  it’s religious indoctrination 
which has no place in a science class.

Action in Iraq, Libya fundamentally different
The current military action in Libya is not the same as the 
Iraq War. Plain and simple. In 2002 and 2003, the United States cooked up a reason to go to war based on faulty intelligence and post-9/11 hysteria. The U.S. went to the U.N., couldn’t get a military resolution, and we invaded Iraq anyway . In Libya’s 
case, the U.S. and our allies are riding with our allies in NATO 
on the back of a U.N. Security Council resolution.
In 2003, the U.S. took up the brunt of the military combat, 
with a sizable British contribution and minimal assistance from other allies. In Libya, we’ve flown about half of the sorties thus far, with NATO on board.
In 2003, we invaded a country that was, at the very least, 
semi-stable. Now, we’re assisting an already ongoing revolu-tion. The anti-Gaddafi forces had been pleading for days for 
world leaders to come to their assistance, as they could not take 
on the pro-Gaddafi military alone.
The Iraq War is a different conflict with different circum-
stances, and I believe this conflict in Libya will have a different outcome.

Most of the news is worth-
less. 
They say we have 
to keep up with all the transient phenomena, but why? For most private citizens, the actions of those far away don’t matter; they 
do little to affect us, and we do 
little to affect them.
Even if you are among those 
praiseworthy few who aim to change things, you have proba-
bly realized you must specialize. 
Only fools spread their efforts over every fashionable cause, leaping from oppression to educa-
tion to malnutrition, never paus-
ing to offer deep and prolonged effort in any direction. The chari-ties waste your money, aware-ness campaigns are forgotten and 
the stone rolls back down the hill. 
As a result, much of the news is irrelevant to even the most in-volved and active of us.
Still less 
n e c e s s a r y 
than letting the news steal our time and attention is letting the news steal our whole day; what 
does not affect us immediately 
need not be known immediately. As an example, for those who have no special connection there, it is vain curiosity to keep check-
ing the news on Libya. Or if you 
lived in a monastery for a couple months and didn’t learn the out-come of a presidential election 
until six weeks afterward, would 
it really matter?
Come to think of it, what 
did you learn from yesterday’s news?

BYU’s Jimmer Fredette (right) puts up a shot against Gonzaga’s Robert Sacre on Saturday. Fredette leads the NCAA with 28.8 points per game, but the Cougars rely on his supporting cast as well.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
Contrary to popular opinion, 
BYU is not a one-man team. 
Although Jimmer Fredette earns 
all the accolades and makes every 
headline, a strong supporting cast 
is what separates the Cougars from 
mediocrity. 
When Florida faces BYU in the 
Sweet 16 on Thursday, the Gators 
will need to concentrate on not just 
the nation’s leading scorer, but also 
his teammates. 
“Jimmer certainly gets a lot of 
publicity and a lot of exposure, but 
it’s really their whole team,” coach 
Billy Donovan said. “I don’t think 
you get to this point in time in the season, like they’ve gotten to, with it just being one guy.”
Fredette’s partner in the back-
court, senior Jackson Emery, has proven to be an effective threat from the outside, averaging 12.6 points per game on 35.9 percent three-point 
shooting. 
Juniors Noah Hartsock and 
Charles Abouo combine for 15.9 
points and 10.8 boards per game, providing a pair of scorers and re-bounders on the interior. 
Emery, Hartsock and Abouo all 
played significant minutes when Florida and BYU clashed in the first round of the NCAA Tournament last season, and all three have only improved since then. 
“They’re all a year older, they’re 
a year better and they’re a year more experienced,” Donovan said. 
“They’re a better team today than 
they were a year ago when we saw 
them.”
In that meeting, Fredette stole 
the show with 37 points in a 99-92 
double-overtime win. 
But Donovan was equally im-
pressed with the contributions of 
BYU’s other players, pointing out that Fredette scored only 27 points 
in the first 45 min-utes. 
“You look at 
the other guys and see that they con-
tributed and did a 
heck of a nice job 
for their team,” Donovan said. “The guys playing alongside Fredette are really, really good players.”
Michael Loyd Jr. in particular 
stepped up for the Cougars last 
season, scoring 26 points despite 
averaging just 5.1 per game for the season. 
Although Loyd is gone, BYU re-
tains a number of other players who 
know their responsibilities and have 
compensated for the loss of Brandon 
Davies, the team’s leading rebound-er, who was suspended for the year Gators wary of threats beyond Fredette in rematch
I had only heard stories and seen brief 
highlights of Jimmer Fredette before seeing him up close and personal.
Billy Donovan said he affected a col-
lege basketball game more than Ken-
tucky phenom John Wall. I had heard 
Florida players talk about how well he shot and how effortlessly he drove the lane.
Before the NCAA Tournament’s 
opening round in Oklahoma City last year, I wandered into BYU’s open locker 
room, feeling like I had to interview the 
Cougars’ scoring machine of whom the Gators had spoken so highly . 
What I found standing in front of one 
of the lockers, behind a throng of record-ers and TV cameras, was a cross between Tim Tebow and Frodo Baggins — a po-lite, unassuming, bright-eyed kid my age answer -
ing questions about his adven-
tures shooting 
hoops with in-mates.
This guy was 
the one lighting up the score-board? This guy?
But what Florida found running wild 
the next day was a cross between Lee Humphrey and Allen Iverson, one of college basketball’s most dynamic scor -
ers and a star in the making.UF ready for The Jimmer Show

Will Muschamp wants to turn Ronald 
Powell into the football equivalent of a su-
perhero. 
He wants him to pressure quarterbacks. 
He wants him to blanket tight ends. He 
wants him in a three-point stance to blow past offensive tackles. He wants him stand-
ing up before the snap to confuse running 
backs in pass protection.
Basically, Muschamp wants Powell to 
keep Southeastern Conference offensive 
coordinators up late at night.
“Ronald is an explosive, strong, tough, 
hard-nosed football player,” Muschamp 
said. “He’s a guy who we feel can create some one-on-ones and some mismatches 
for a defense. He’s a guy you’re going to 
need to account for.”After studying film of his new play-
ers, Muschamp told Powell at the begin-ning of the semester he would be playing the Buck, a spot that has immediately be-come the sexiest position on the field, if 
for no other reason than the name alone. 
Said 303-pound defensive tackle Sharrif 
Floyd: “I wish I could be a Buck.”
But Powell is a bet-

HOT SHOTS
1. Erving Walker, Jr.
T-2. Kenny Boynton, So.
T-2. Chandler Parsons, Sr.Walker led UF in scoring versus UC Santa Barbara 
and UCLA, combining for 39 points in the two wins. 
The junior guard’s most notable contributions came 
late, as he dropped 10 points in the final four min -
utes against the Bruins. Walker was exceptionally hot from outside last week, hitting 7 of 11 threes, and 
he added eight assists with only two turnovers.
Boynton tied for the No. 2 spot on our list, forcing a 
three-way tie for first atop our season-long rankings. 
The sophomore guard was a reliable scoring threat, 
finishing second on the team with 25 points and con -
tinuing his hot shooting with a 9-of-18 performance. 
He recorded a team-best 6-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio and led the way with four steals.
Parsons posted a triple-double between the two 
games, notching 17 points, 15 assists and 12 re -
bounds. In only 27 minutes against UCSB, the senior 
forward recorded 10 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds, falling just short of the first triple-double of his career. Despite a subpar performance against UCLA, Parsons made a critical block with 6:33 
remaining, sparking a 6-0 run.

STANDINGS
Jocelyne Sanchez / Alligator StaffDonovan expects Boynton to play Thursday
following a violation of the 
school’s honor code. 
“Those other guys play 
to their role and understand 
their role and do it effective-
ly,” Donovan said. 
INJURY UPDATE: Sophomore 
guard Kenny Boynton was 
held out of practice Monday 
after spraining his left ankle 
Saturday against UCLA. 
Donovan said Boynton 
dealt with major swelling in 
the imme-
diate after -
math of the 
injury, but the next 
24 hours 
went “very 
well” and the trainers have 
been able to minimize the discomfort to the point where 
Boynton can walk normally. 
The sophomore said he 
hopes to return to the court 
today, and Donovan antici-pates having him back by 
Thursday. 
“We fully expect him to 
play,” Donovan said. “He 
definitely has some discom-
fort, but I don’t feel like his 
discomfort is enough to pre-
vent him from playing.”HOOPS , from page 13
Jimmer scored 37 points on 50 
percent shooting from the field, 
forcing UF defenders to chase him all over the court for 46 min-utes. Kenny Boynton, who led 
Florida with 27 points, was given 
the tall order of stopping Jimmer — or at least slowing him down.
Bum ankle or not, Boynton 
will once again have to defend the nation’s leading scorer.
But, unlike last year, when he 
was reduced to leaning over and clutching his knees on the court, 
Boynton won’t be alone.
It’s no secret Florida lacked 
backcourt depth last year. UF coach Billy Donovan said his 
team was “six-and-a-half” play-ers deep, and Boynton was the 
best matchup for Jimmer.
Now, Donovan can turn to 
Casey Prather and, more likely , 
Scottie Wilbekin, who will find 
himself face-to-face with the country’s most prolific scorer early and often Thursday night.
“There’s going to be a lot of 
guys on him,” Donovan said. “I hope that Kenny would not be on him as many minutes as he was a year ago because we have 
a little more added depth.”
But the truth, as Donovan 
admitted, is that it doesn’t really 
matter who guards Jimmer. 
He is going to keep his drib-ble, create his own looks and make absurd shots from a few feet behind the three-point line. 
He is going to leave his de-
fenders tired, out of breath and wishing Gonzaga had upset 
BYU in the Round of 32.
And he is going to score. A 
lot. 
“There are a lot of times that 
you’re at his mercy ,” Donovan 
said. “For us to sit there and say , ‘We’re going to eliminate him even getting a shot off,’ that’s just totally inaccurate on our part 
to even think that.”
Opponents have thrown ev-
ery imaginable defense at BYU, 
and Jimmer has been unstoppa-ble. He’s not scoring 28.8 points per game, shooting 45.5 percent from the field or making 40.6 percent of his threes by accident. 
And he has only gotten better 
lately , averaging 34.7 points per game in March.
“I don’t know if anybody has 
just shut that guy down,” Dono-van said. “I just don’t think that’s going to happen.”
But Jimmer can’t beat Florida 
alone. The Gators have more ath-leticism, more depth and more 
reliable scoring options than the 
Cougars. And UF will need to capitalize on its advantages.
Because that unassuming guy 
I saw in the locker room — that 
guy — will light up the score-board against Florida. Again.ADAM , from page 13

WINTHROP TONIGHT AT 7 IN McKETHAN STADIUM.
By JESSE SIMONTON

Riding an eight-game win-
ning streak and the best start in 
program history, the top-ranked 
Gators look poised to make a run 
back to Omaha, Neb.
But while the trio of quality 
starters and a deep lineup receive 
most of the praise, an unsung 
piece has emerged for No. 1 Flor -
ida this season: its pinch-hitting prowess.    
While pinch-hitting is argu-
ably the most difficult aspect in baseball, the Gators (18-2, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) are ex-celling at it.  
Entering tonight’s home tilt  
against the Winthrop Eagles (9-9, 2-1 Big South) at 7, UF sports a .364 average (12 for 33) in pinch-hitting situations. 
Jeff Moyer (4 for 8) and Kamm 
Washington (4 for 7) have been Florida’s most successful sub-stitute batters, coming up with 
several key hits in pressure spots, including three clutch knocks last week. 
“It’s hard coming off the 
bench,” said Moyer, a Santa Fe College transfer. “Especially af-ter playing in community college 
where you’re used to starting ev-ery game. “But playing a different role 
here at Florida, you’ve got to get used to the different situations you’re brought into. “I’ve been working on getting 
my mind right and staying posi-tive throughout the game, and when my number is called just going in there and doing my best 
to get the job done.”
Against Florida State, coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan pulled senior 
Josh Adams in the eighth inning in favor of Moyer.
The junior came through, ig-
niting a rally that tied the game. 
During Sunday’s win over No. 
11 LSU, Moyer was called upon 
with two outs and two runners 
in scoring position as UF trailed 3-2.  
After getting behind in the 
count, Moyer responded by bar -
reling a base hit up the middle. 
The two-RBI knock put the 
Gators ahead for good and led to a career day for the transfer.
“It was a huge hit for him,” 
O’Sullivan said. “He’s going to be a huge factor for us as we go into conference play.”
Moyer said he is always ex-
cited to get the call and is glad 
he has earned his manager’s trust 
with the game on the line. 
“I have the mindset going into 
the game that Sully is going to call my number in a key situa-tion,” he said.TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 2011  ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida freshman guard Jaterra Bonds led the Gators with 19 points in their 
74-69 win over FGCU on Monday night. 
UF WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
Florida showed Monday why there’s no sub-
stitute for size. 
Playing in front a sellout, record-breaking 
crowd of 4,543, the Gators’ bigs made the differ -
ence in a 74-69 victory over Florida Gulf Coast 
in the second round of the Women’s National Invitation Tournament on Monday in Alico 
Arena in Fort Myers.
“(Our) teamwork … seemed to get bet-
ter when things were at their worst,” Florida 
coach Amanda Butler said. “We were down 
seven, eight, nine a few times and it was loud 
in here.”
Florida struggled against the nation’s best 
three-point shooting team in the first half, al-lowing 7 of 14 three-pointers that helped put 
FGCU up by five at the break.
But the game was decided inside — where 
FGCU lacked a significant contributor taller 
than 5-foot-10.
After FGCU guard Courtney Chihil made 
a driving layup and the following foul shot to put the Eagles up 63-62 with just more than five minutes left, Florida forward Jennifer George and center Azania Stewart took control. 
The 6-foot-4 Stewart made an easy turn-
around layup to give the Gators the lead. Shortly after, Stewart forced an airballed three-pointer and George scored easily on the other end. 
Then, after a miss by FGCU’s Nicoya Jackson, 
Stewart added another layup to give Florida a 68-63 lead with 3:07 remaining. 
“When we started to try to establish our -
selves in the paint successfully ... that was trig-
gered by Azania and George,” Butler said.  
After getting run around the gym by a team 
full of smaller sharpshooters for much of the 
game, the Gators emerged when they finally took the game to the post.  
George swatted the Eagles’ next two field 
goal attempts, allowing Florida to regain pos-session and guard Jaterra Bonds to clinch the game at the free-throw line. 
George finished with 10 points and 11 re-
bounds in 24 minutes, while Stewart posted six points and six boards. 
The teams were actually tied at 11 rebounds 
each at halftime, and Butler said her team head-
ed into the locker room disappointed with its 
effort on the glass. 
“We knew they were going to try and do a 
lot of things to take our paint scoring away,” 
Butler said. “But it’s impossible to take away 
rebounding.”
Florida limited FGCU to just eight boards 
in the second half and finished with a 33-19 re-bounding advantage. 
While the difference-making plays came 
from the post, the scoring of Deana Allen (17 points) and Bonds (19 points) put the Gators in position. 
Both had to step up after guards Lanita Bart-
ley and Jordan Jones were limited by foul trou-ble.
The Eagles had won 42 straight at Alico Are-
na entering Monday’s contest, while the Gators 
had won just three of nine games on the road, 
including multiple heartbreaking losses.
“We’ve been here before,” Butler said. 
“We’ve been in hostile environments where the 
seats are filled with Gator haters. Being able to 
overcome it as opposed to coming up a posses-sion short is a great demonstration of how far we’ve come this season.”
Fittingly, the season now comes full circle. 
With the win, Florida advances to play Char -
lotte on Thursday at 7 p.m., a team they defeat-ed in the second round of the Preseason WNIT earlier this year. Post players push Florida past FGCU in WNIT

Florida junior infielder Jeff Moyer has come up big for the Gators as a pinch-hitter, converting on 4 of 8 
opportunities this season. Moyer ignited UF’s game-tying eighth-inning rally against FSU on Tuesday.
Gators displaying impressive pinch-hitting abilitydescribed as a disappointing fresh-
man campaign last fall. He played 
in all 13 games, but his only start came Nov. 20 against Appalachian State. In limited action last year, 
Powell recorded 25 tackles, one 
sack and two pass breakups.
There were reports that Pow-ell and fellow freshman defen-sive lineman Dominique Easley skipped a practice in September, and he admitted to being hard-headed. Veterans like then-senior 
Mike Pouncey called Powell and 
the rest of the freshmen out, say-ing they needed to shut up and learn from the older players.
“I’m not going to go all into 
what (Powell) was really like,” defensive end William Green said. “He was just a young guy. He’s gotten a lot better.”
With a new coaching staff 
comes a fresh start, and Powell is excited about his role after watch-
ing film of Jason Taylor and former 
Texas Longhorn Sergio Kindle. 
“It’s the best position for me,” 
Powell said. “If I could have 
picked any position, it would 
have been the Buck position.”
Taylor, who switched from a 
traditional defensive end to a hy-
brid player when Muschamp and defensive coordinator Dan Quinn coached him with the Dolphins, was named the NFL Defensive 
Player of the Year in 2006 after re-
cording 62 tackles, 13.5 sacks and two interceptions returned for touchdowns. 
Kindle, who played a similar 
role when Muschamp was his defensive coordinator at Texas, was on the watch list for both the Butkus (best linebacker) and Hen-
dricks (best defensive lineman) 
awards in 2009.
While the new role will give 
Powell more freedom, it also could be more confusing. So far, 
less than a week into spring prac-
tices, Powell feels comfortable with everything the coaches have thrown at him. 
But how many tackles he makes 
— and how many hours of sleep he costs opposing coaches — de-pends on how he develops.16, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 2011

Last year, Florida’s freshmen struggled to establish a good 
rapport with the team’s upperclassmen, often clashing with 
the veterans.
But with spring practice underway and a new group of 
leaders in control, the Gators have made chemistry a prior -
ity.
“The whole team is buying in, and we welcome everyone 
that comes in,” sophomore Buck linebacker Ronald Powell said. “We’re going to be together for a long time, so we might as well get it straight now.”
Powell was part of the nation’s No. 2 recruiting class, a 
group that came to UF with a sense of entitlement that led to conflicts between the first-year players and the Gators’ more established upperclassmen.
But the sophomores are looking to put those issues behind 
them. According to defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd, they took some time after last season to adjust their attitudes and refocus on their goals as a team.
“We need to get this better because it’s not 
what we wanted to come here and do,” Floyd said. “It was a good season, but it wasn’t the 
season we all predicted, so I guess right after the season we all 
got on board and just wanted to do better.”
CHRISTIAN MAKING TRANSITION TO DEFENSE: When Florida 
announced the move away from a spread-option offense, Gerald Christian was excited about the prospect of being a pro-style tight end. 
Three  months and one position change later, the sopho-
more is on the other side of the ball but still ready to make an impact for Florida.
Christian, who played defense in high school, is listed as 
the starting strong-side linebacker on the Gators’ spring depth chart. But Florida coach Will Muschamp has warned his team that the preseason projections are not set in stone.
“It’s not definite. I’m No. 1 on the depth chart, but I’ve still 
got to earn the position,” Christian said. “Honestly, I would have felt better being at the bottom and working to the top, trying to earn it more. I’m going to work hard anyway.”Sophomores past
