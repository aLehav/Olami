A firefighter walks out of a burned house at 3818 NE 12th St. Fire Rescue District Chief Richard Saulsberry said five 
adults and two children lived in the house, but only one elderly woman was home at the time of the incident.

A residential fire Thursday night displaced seven 
people and left an elderly woman with second- and 
third-degree burns on 90 percent of her body.
According to Gainesville Fire Rescue District Chief 
Richard Saulsberry, emergency units responded to a call at about 6 p.m. on Thursday about a fire at 3818 NE 12th St., where smoke was billowing out of the resi-dence. 
When units arrived, an elderly woman, whose name 
was not released, sat in a white lawn chair at the edge of the driveway, badly burned.
“There is a possibility she may pass,” Saulsberry 
said, adding that all residents were accounted for.
Saulsberry said fire units at the scene contained the 
blaze to the living room and kitchen area. The inside of the house was destroyed, with black smoke marks on the outside walls, broken windows, chunks of plaster, and a lone, charred, slatted door on the floor. 
The woman was the only one home at the time, 
Saulsberry said, and she was transported to Shands at UF.
Damages from the fire were estimated at $80,000.The residents, five adults and two children, watched 
firefighters fight the blaze, and walked away in a hud-dle when they were told they would not be able to re-enter the house. 
Later Thursday night, Saulsberry spoke with the el-
derly woman’s daughter, who said the outlook for her mother wasn’t good. 
The incident is under investigation by the State Fire 
Marshal and Sandy Ellison of Gainesville Fire Rescue.Elderly woman in critical condition after house fire

A grudge stretching back to 
high school put one UF student 
on the windshield of a car and an-other in jail Thursday morning.  
Cornelia Dean ended the night with a broken wrist after Shalonda Lewis hit Dean with her car. Lewis was arrested and charged with aggravated battery.
The feud, though, was not between 
Dean and Lewis.
Dean was protecting her friend De-
Cara Jones, who had a long-standing feud with Lewis. A Gainesville Police report and witnesses gave this account:
After a night out at Status Nightclub, 
Jones ran into Lewis at 2 a.m. at the entrance of 2nd Avenue Centre apart-ments, where Jones lives and Lewis was visiting a friend on the first floor. They are both from Lakeland and know each other through mutual friends.
Jones, a philosophy junior, said she 
and Lewis had issues three or four years ago that were never resolved. Lately, the two had been cordial. They go to the same parties, and earlier that night they had said hello to each other in the club’s bathroom.
Jones said she couldn’t even remem-
ber how the feud started.
But standing outside the apartment 
complex Thursday morning, Lewis flashed Jones a “dirty look.” Later, in the hallway, she continued to stir the UF student injured after 
friend hits her with car � GOVERNOR SIGNED BILL LAST 
YEAR.

A house bill passed last year may affect stu-
dent voting eligibility in the Jan. 31 elections 
and the November presidential election.
The Florida House of Representatives bill 
put more restrictions on voting registration, location and duration.
The bill eliminates the possibility of chang-
ing one’s address on Election Day and adds restrictions on organizations that register people to vote among other changes, said Pam Carpenter, Alachua County supervisor of elections.
The bill, Florida House Bill 1355, was ap-
proved by Gov. Rick Scott on May 19.
Before it was approved, people were al-lowed to make an address change at the polling site. Now, to change a voting ad-dress within a county, voters need to fill out a change of address form. At that point, they will be assigned a new precinct.
Third parties can still register people to 
vote, but now all registra-tion forms must be turned 
in to a county supervisor of elections office within 48 hours of completion.
There is a $50 fine per 
application if the form is unintentionally late and a $250 fine if the form is in-
tentionally late, Carpenter said.
It is illegal to vote in a precinct to which 
you are not assigned, Carpenter said.
Some UF students are unhappy with the 
effect this bill may have on upcoming city and Florida legislature bill may     
affect student voters’ eligibility

After accident, Carnival Corp. 
wants safety review 
MIAMI  — Carnival Corp., the 
parent company of Costa Cruises, 
announced on Thursday a com-prehensive audit and review of all safety and emergency response procedures across all 10 of the company’s cruise lines.
Carnival Chairman and CEO 
Micky Arison said in a news re-lease that last week’s accident of the Costa Concordia in Italy has called into question the company’s safety and emergency response procedures and practices.
The Costa Concordia capsized 
off the Tuscan island of Giglio last Friday after the ship detoured from its route and slammed into a reef. At least 11 people were killed and 21 are missing.
“While I have every confidence 
in the safety of our vessels and the professionalism of our crews, this review will evaluate all practices and procedures to make sure that this kind of accident doesn’t hap-pen again,” Arison said.
The review is being led by re-
tired U.S. Navy Capt. James Hunn, who is the company’s senior vice president of Maritime Policy & Compliance.
Hunn and executives from 
each of the corporation’s subsid-iary cruise lines will review all safety policies, employee training, bridge management and response and support efforts.

Margaret Block’s voice filled Ustler Hall as audience 
members joined her in song.
Block, a civil rights activist, visited UF on Thursday 
night as part of the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, 
an organization which strives to preserve oral history.
After she greeted the crowd twice, demanding a bet-
ter “good evening” response, Block spoke to the crowd of about 170 people regarding former President George W. Bush, religion and equality.
She sang songs and presented poems about the Patriot 
Act, justice and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.
“One day I was sitting at home, and the FBI called me,” 
Block said, “I almost had a stroke.”
Turns out, it didn’t have to do with one of her poems 
she sent the president, but with a cold case from the civil rights movement.
Some students went to the event for class assignments 
or extra credit.
Daylin Farinas, a 20-year-old political science sopho-
more, said she attended because she had to write a paper for her race, law and constitution class.
However, she was also interested to hear Block’s story 
because she thinks it’s better to hear about the past directly from older generations.
Farinas said she would like to read Block’s works in ad-
dition to hearing the speech to help her understand Block’s journey with the civil rights movement for her paper.
Kim Devitt, a 21-year-old public relations senior, said 
she heard about Block’s speech on civil rights in her socio-logical and historical foundations of education class. She decided to come to the event because she was excited to hear Block’s personal story.
Devitt pointed out that learning about civil rights from 
a textbook is a totally different experience than hearing it firsthand.
“It’s amazing how today we don’t struggle with the 
same types of issues that, say , a 21-year-old did in the ‘60s,” Devitt said. “Today I realized on the Sorority Row bus that it doesn’t really matter who you sit next to. It doesn’t even cross your mind these days.”

� PESTICIDE PROTECTS 
CITRUS PLANTS.
ALLI LANGLEY
Alligator Writer
UF researchers have discov-
ered an insecticide that comes from 
something humans eat every day.
Methionine is an essential ami-
no acid that humans get from food, and it can double as a pesticide against the invasive lime swallow-tail caterpillar that could threaten Florida’s citrus industry.
“This shows that we can find 
an alternative to the bad chemi-cal pesticides,” said Delano Lewis, co-author of the study , which was published in the Journal of Eco-nomic Entomology.Because the lime swallowtail 
can’t be legally brought into the U.S., researchers experimented us-ing a similar species.
The pesticide was 100 percent 
effective in killing the caterpillars on wild lime trees within three to four days. 
It is harmless to citrus plants, 
mammals and birds, Lewis said. In the soil, the amino acid would be-come fertilizer for the plants.
“It’s better than most of the oth-
er chemicals out there because it’s more targeted to the specific type of insect you want,” he said. 
The research was funded by 
UF’s Division of Sponsored Re-search and the Florida Museum of Natural History’s Museum Associ-ates Board.UF research: amino acid

A recently released report shows binge drinking 
is still prevalent throughout the country, and experts 
say UF is no exception.
The report, published this month by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, states that more than 90 percent of the alcohol youth drink is con-sumed while binge drinking.
According to the CDC’s January 2012 Vital Signs 
report, most binge drinkers in the U.S. are 18 to 34 years old. 
“Individuals in that age range, for the most part, 
tend to be more accepting of binge drinking among their peers,” said Lisa Merlo, a clinical psychologist at UF. “It plays a larger role in social interactions compared to some other age groups.”
UF’s Core Alcohol and Drug Survey confirms that 
UF is no stranger to the issue of binge drinking. Ac-cording to the 2010 survey, 41.6 percent of participat-ing students reported having five or more drinks in one sitting within two weeks of taking the survey.
The CDC defines binge drinking as consuming 
four or more alcoholic beverages within a short pe-riod of time for women and five or more for men.
Additionally, more than half of UF students sur -
veyed reported having a hangover in the past year, and about one third admitted to having memory loss due to drinking. However, the survey stated that 5.8 percent or 
less of people who took the survey considered their drinking a problem.
“With that age group, regardless of whether 
you’re in college or not, there’s that feeling of invinci-bility that a lot of young people have,” said Maureen Miller, coordinator for alcohol and drug prevention at UF.
College students are not immune to the conse-
quences of binge drinking, said Cara Bearison, 20-year-old management sophomore.
“It’s not fun for you because you’ll probably 
throw up and not remember anything,”  Bearison said. “You’re putting yourself at risk for basically anything bad that could happen to you, so I think it’s dangerous.”
Despite high levels of alcohol abuse among stu-
dents, percentages of alcohol use have decreased gradually since 2004, according to the UF survey.
“I like to think that’s a positive sign — kind of 
contributing to the work that we have been doing,” Miller said. “I feel really good about the direction that we’re heading.”Binge drinking still prevalent in US

 Darts & Laurels
 First, we travel to the Midwest to throw a how’s-that-
tax-hike-working-out-for-you DART to the state of Illi-
nois, which increased state income taxes by 67 percent and also increased corporate taxes. Despite its effort to raise revenue through these tax hikes, the state is still facing an $8.5-billion shortfall, according to Illinois State Comptrol-ler Judy Baar Topinka. 
Well, that worked. Next, we give an it-may-have-taken-him-a-while-to-
sound-out-the-writing-on-the-wall LAUREL to Rick Perry 
for dropping out of the GOP race. He did the best in the polls before the nation had a chance to hear him speak. 
After that, it was all downhill. Of course, we can’t end the week without giving a 
standing-up-to-censorship LAUREL to Wikipedia and the 
nearly 7,000 other websites that blacked out their pages in protest of SOPA and PIPA, the anti-Internet piracy bills currently under consideration in Congress. 
We hope it pays off. On a related note, we’re throwing a dude-like-WTF-is-
up-with-like-Wikipedia DART to the high-school students 
who freaked out all over Twitter and other social network-ing sites on Wednesday when they couldn’t use Wikipedia to do their science homework. 
Reading is hard, isn’t it? Also from the Midwest, we’re going to toss an I’ve-got-
a-fever-and-the-only-prescription-is-more-cowbell LAU-
REL to the 26-year-old Wisconsin man who refused to 
stop playing his cowbell in protest of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. 
He was, of course, arrested for resisting arrest and dis-
orderly conduct, but it sounded awesome.   
Finally, we throw a chill-the-eff-out DART to Gainesville 
criminals. It seems like we can’t go a day without another report of armed robbery, attempted rape or murder. 
Law-abiding citizens of Gainesville: Make sure you nev-
er go out alone, and stay away from sketchy areas. Don’t open your door to strangers, and be sure to keep all of the valuables in your car hidden. 
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week. Parties champion, sacrifice different liberties
At a dinner reception in 1830, President Andrew 
Jackson proposed a toast, saying, “Our Union: It must be preserved.” Jackson’s vice president,
John Calhoun, gave a toast of his own, saying, “The 
Union, next to our liberty most dear.” 
The division demonstrated in these competing toasts a 
microcosm of the American political landscape today. The idea of liberty — freedom from control, interference and obligation — has virtually gone in, as Paul Craig Roberts of Press TV so aptly put it, “a forgotten grave in a forgot-ten graveyard.”
Naturally, when governments are installed, they in-
fringe on their people’s liberty through obligations such as taxes and restrictions like a minimum drinking age. The trade-off between liberty and some government in-terference is worth it when government interference is limited. 
Today, however, liberty is under assault from both par -
ties in the government. While each party appears to pro-mote one aspect of liberty, each, often in the same breath, condemns liberty in other parts of life. 
Republicans advocate economic liberty, yet wish to 
control social liberty under the guise of morality. For instance, they are proponents of tax cuts, increasing the amount of your money that isn’t forcibly taken by the government.  Meanwhile, Republicans are also in favor of restricting your social liberty: Think of President Rich-ard Nixon declaring a “war on drugs” and citing drugs as “public enemy No. 1.” Whether or not you are for drug use, criminalizing and arresting drug users inherently limits one’s social liberty.
Democrats are the reverse. On the one hand, they 
want to increase social liberty. For instance, they gener -
ally believe that people can marry whomever, regardless of gender. Yet Democrats limit economic liberty, favoring higher taxes to pay for expanded social services. Forcibly taking more of the money that people worked hard for restrains economic liberty.
The irony is that both parties 
promote their own chunk of lib-erty and spurn the other for the same reason: morality. Repub-licans must restrict institutions like marriage because it is, ac-cording to them, only morally acceptable to allow a man and a woman to wed. Democrats are 
compelled to steal more of your money to take care of (usually) indigent people because they feel the moral ob-ligation to help the poor. According to the logic of both parties, the people in Washington think certain aspects of liberty should be limited, because, of course, they know what is best for you. Both parties champion partial lib-erty, yet condemn total liberty.
Contrary to what the politicians may imply, liberty is 
not something you can chop up. You either have it or you don’t, almost like the item that precedes it in the Declara-tion of Independence: life. Liberty is not piecewise; it’s either whole or not really liberty. 
The assault on liberty can be seen as a function of gov-
ernment expansion. As the government grows, it takes more of the pie, and politicians believe in an incremental expansion,  meaning the government should grow slight-ly each year, shaving off a little bit more liberty yearly.
We ought to realize virtually all mainstream politicians 
halfheartedly believe in liberty, but there is hope. The light at the end of the tunnel is a frail man named Ron Paul. He believes in preserving the entirety of liberty, not one chunk or the other. In a debate last year, Paul introduced himself as “the champion of liberty.” Disregard what the political merry-go-round media espouse, and really listen to what these politicians are saying — it may scare you.

Students Party wrong to 
criticize Senate process
As Senate president, I 
want to address the deliber -
ate lies of Students Party Sen. Carly Wilson that appeared in yesterday’s letter to the editor. The actions displayed in Tuesday night’s meeting were a disgrace to the Senate process and, more important, to the students of UF.  
Following the Fall 2011 
elections, I charged the elec-tion code revision committee to address any problems that may have occurred. The Stu-dents Party was given repre-sentation on the committee and, in fact, Sen. Wilson se-lected who would represent that party.
Not once during the 
month and a half that the committee was reviewing the codes did any member of the Students Party sub-mit suggestions. During the first reading of the changes at the Jan. 10 Senate meeting, Students Party members did raise some concerns about the election codes, but they offered no amendments. It was announced that the elec-tion code committee would meet again for more revi-sions before the second, and final, reading of the election code reform bill. All senators and nonsenators were en-couraged to submit amend-ments and suggestions for the committee to review. Again, nothing was received from anyone in the Students Party.
Several Unite senators, 
however, took the initiative to make additional amend-ments to address the con-cerns that were raised by Students Party members at the previous meeting. These amendments were passed unanimously by members of both parties at the Jan. 17 Senate meeting.
Sen. Wilson’s desperate 
attempt to blatantly lie about the election code revision process is nothing more than a publicity stunt and a prime example of partisan politics at its finest. If Sen.  Wilson spent half as much time drafting meaningful legisla-tion as she does making up lies about the Unite Party , UF and its students would be far better off.

Letters to the Editor
The Internet is often compared to the Wild West due to its anything-goes, uncharted nature. As users, the occasionally unruly but excitingly un-
bound environment has pros and cons; we worry about its risks but embrace its benefits.
Last fall, Congress introduced the Stop Online Piracy 
Act, or SOPA, to serve as the new sheriff in town, aiming to bring some order to these here parts. SOPA’s trusty deputy, the PROTECT IP Act (short for the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act) also gained traction in the Senate, including co-sponsorships from both Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken.
Aside from forcing late nights at the Capitol Hill Ac-
ronym Creation Office (CHACO), SOPA and PIPA — the short form of an already-shortened mouthful — have stirred up controversy. The biggest concern is the po-tential of a less free and open Internet, as websites sus-pected of copyright infringement and piracy could face steep consequences, including blocked access from ser-vice providers and search engines. This indirect form of “censorship” threatens the Internet as we’ve known it.
As an act of protest against SOPA, Wikipedia blacked 
out its website Wednesday, which you may have noticed when you tried to look up Rachel McAdams’ age or the overall population of the Greater Stockholm metropoli-tan area. Reddit, among other sites, joined the blackout, too. Google, eBay, Twitter and Facebook also voiced op-position to the bills. These aren’t random niche websites contesting the legislation; if there were a Mount Rush-more for the Internet, those four faces would be on it.
The objection to the bills rests in that we’ve grown 
accustomed to the services that the Internet provides, even if there is some infringement. It’s similar to being in a third world country and seeing a bootlegged T-shirt with Bart Simpson or Tweety Bird on it. Vendors prob-ably didn’t check with Matt Groening or either Warner brother to legally display these cartoons wearing the country’s colors while playing soccer, but, “who cares; let it slide,” tends 
to be the response. The practice is seemingly harmless and doesn’t merit strict enforcement, even if use of the image is technically prohibited.
Weighing the societal benefit versus the specific 
ownership rights for intellectual property can be tricky. Trekkies don’t upload episodes of their favorite show to hurt the franchise; their goal is to further the show’s success, not lessen it. Yet the process does affect profits and production, because even if consumers aren’t pay-ing a price to download a movie or song, someone paid a price to provide it. It’s easy to point to rich executives, actors and musicians, but technicians and stagehands support SOPA too — their incomes are affected by a film’s revenue.
The reality of the Internet is that we’ve progressed 
by using it without the looming regulations. Were we spoiled with too much of a good thing? Probably. But it wasn’t monitored closely enough early on, so we dove in. Is it now worth limiting access to information and material that has been both useful and enjoyable? Prob-ably not. So, companies should look to modify their business models to correspond with the reality of our Internet habits. The recreational and productive value of the Internet in its current form is evident; encourag-ing the free flow of information is always worth the ben-efit of the doubt.
A tweet opposing SOPA said the act is “trying to put 
out a match with a fire extinguisher.” There’s no deny-ing that piracy and infringement are problems, but the solution should be adjusting to demand, not overreact-ing to the problem.

Homes that have cars parked 
all over the yard may soon need 
a driveway.
The Gainesville City Com-
mission decided Thursday to draft a petition that would es-tablish parking regulations for multi-family homes around UF’s campus. 
This would include the area 
bordered by Southwest 13th Street, University Avenue and Southwest Sixth Street. 
Many of these are single-fam-
ily homes zoned as multi-family homes, meaning one house in-cludes more than one residence. 
As a result, five or six cars are 
parked in the yard, said Com-missioner Thomas Hawkins.
Parking spaces would have 
to be accessed by an approved driveway, and cars would not be allowed to drive over a curb to park, according to the draft plan.
Landlords acquired these 
homes before current zoning codes were established, he said. 
Prior to current codes, land-
lords didn’t have to submit a parking plan, and cars could be parked anywhere on the prop-erty.
Hawkins said parking on 
these properties destroys curbs and sidewalks.
After cars continually park 
on grass, dirt begins to surface and dumps into the city’s storm water system. 
Hawkins said this counter-acts money from the city aimed to treat storm water.
Mulch or gravel could be 
used to prevent erosion, accord-ing to the draft plan.
If passed, the amended or-
dinance would allow the city to approach these homeowners and create a parking plan.
“This is long overdue,” 
Hawkins said.8, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 2012

� THE ENGINEERING CLASS 
WILL BE THE FIRST TO TEST THE PROGRAM AT UF.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Writer
Students in an engineering class 
are getting the chance to hang out 
with their professor online for the first time at UF.  
Dan Dickrell III is using 
Google+ Hangouts for additional office hours in his Engineering Mechanics-Statics class this semes-ter. Students can either go to the lecture or view it online.
Using Google+ Hangouts, Dick-
rell or a teaching assistant can vid-eo chat with up to nine students at once and share documents. 
Statics is a math-based class, 
and he said he plans to use the screen-sharing function to show problems. 
However, because it is his first 
semester using Hangouts at UF, Dickrell will be using it to a limited degree. 
He will announce chats on e-
Learning throughout the semester, he said, but he will still offer in-person office hours and reviews. 
“It will be pretty useful come 
exam time when TA and instructor help is in high demand,” he said. 
Statics student Will Smith, a 
20-year-old aerospace engineering sophomore, already has a Google+ account and said he will probably use the Hangout feature. “It’s certainly a lot more con-
venient,” he said. “I don’t have to worry about running out of time between classes to get to office hours.” 
However, Japa Kulwatno, a 
19-year-old materials engineering sophomore, said he doesn’t think Hangouts will be as beneficial as the in-person office hours. 
“When someone is watching 
how you answer, it’s easier to cor -
rect them than going between a medium that is the computer,” he said.
Dickrell heard about Google+ 
Hangouts through Keivan Zolf-aghari, UF’s Google Student Am-bassador. 
The 20-year-old food and re-
search economics and psychology junior said he has talked to several UF professors about using Hang-outs, but Dickrell is the only one using it so far. If professors held public Hangouts, they would only be able to see students’ public in-formation, Zolfaghari said.
Other universities are already 
using Google+ Hangouts. At Rice University, Teach for America used it to speak with a recruiter and corps members around the country, he said. The university president also took live questions via Hangouts. Zolfaghari also said students at Boise State University are using Hangouts for makeshift study sessions.  
“Google Hangouts is just a tool 
in the toolbox to teach the class ef-ficiently,” Dickrell said.Class to hold Google+

At a Gainesville City Commis-
sion candidate debate Thursday 
night, District 1 candidates bat-tled with ideas about job creation while at-large 1 candidates dis-cussed spending in the city.
Seven of the eight at-large 1 
candidates attended the forum hosted by the Alachua County Democratic Black Caucus. Rich-ard Selwach was absent. All three of the District 1 candidates at-tended.  
At-large 1 candidates shared 
their opinions about what is wrong with the current com-mission and how they would improve it. They touched on the city’s biomass contract, wasteful spending and public transporta-tion. 
Nathan Skop, Lauren Poe and 
Darlene Pifalo, candidates for the at-large 1 seat, directed com-ments toward one other regard-ing the biomass contract. Dejeon Cain, an at-large 1 candidate, interjected frequently about im-proving east Gainesville.
District 1 commissioners were 
left with about 30 minutes to speak at the end of the forum. Ar -
mando Grundy, Ray Washington and Yvonne Hinson-Rawls were more confrontational toward each other about their ideas, and Grundy and Washington raised their voices.

� PRICES ARE UP 30 
CENTS FROM LAST YEAR.
DAVID WILLIAMS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students might be paying 
more money at the gas pump 
this year, which could push more students onto buses.
The average price for a gal-
lon of gas is about 30 cents more than it was this time last year, according to a statement made by AAA. 
David Denslow, a UF eco-
nomics professor, said gas prices are relatively stable now and probably won’t see major changes anytime soon. If prices increase, he said, they won’t have a large impact on uni-versity transportation because there are plans in place for gas price fluctuation.
Regional Transit System is a 
viable alternative for those af-fected by gas prices, said Chip Skinner, spokesman for RTS.
He said unless gas prices 
reach $5 a gallon, RTS compen-sates for any fluctuation by ad-justing its budget before charg-ing riders more. 
“A lot of people don’t real-
ize that over 50 percent of our operating budget does come from the University of Florida,” he said.
This portion is comprised 
of fees tied into students’ credit hours and campus redevelop-ment funds.
RTS transports about 50,000 
people a day, Skinner said.Gas price increases

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah man who lost his 
class ring six months after he bought it is getting the 
keepsake back 45 years later, thanks to some Face-book detective work.
Brent Aguirre said his mother was disappointed 
when the 1966 Bonneville High School graduate lost the ring, which is gold-toned with a deep blue stone.
“It’s a beautiful ring,” he told KSL-TV . “I remem-
ber mom and dad forked out pretty good money for it.”
He assumed the ring was at the bottom of Pinev-
iew Reservoir, not far from the Great Salt Lake, and wrote it off when he left to fight in Vietnam.
The military service turned into an Air Force 
career that led him through nine different moves across the world and finally back to his hometown of Ogden. It wasn’t until the fall that Aguirre received a Facebook message from a couple in nearby Sandy, saying they wanted to get in touch with him.
He brushed it off, but they contacted him again, 
telling him they’d found a ring with his name in-scribed in cursive script.
The couple still isn’t sure where the ring came 
from. The husband said he can’t remember where he originally found it, and the wife said the keep-sake turned up when she was cleaning out a desk drawer.
“It was unbelievable,” Aguirre said. “I had writ-
ten it off, and it was hard to believe they actually had my ring.”
Aguirre met up with the couple just after Christ-
mas. More than four decades later, the ring no longer fits on his ring finger, but Aguirre said he’s happy to have it on his pinky.
He said he only has one regret: That his mother, 
once upset that her teenage son lost the valuable so quickly, was not around to see that he’d found it at last.Utah man gets

Celebrity chef and butter duchess 
Paula Deen announced Tuesday on 
NBC’s “Today Show” that she has Type 2 diabetes.
Deen, 64, said she was diagnosed 
three years ago. She has now become a spokeswoman for pharmaceutical group Novo Nordisk to endorse its diabetes drug, Victoza. Victoza is injected once a day by Type 2 diabetes patients to con-trol their blood sugar levels.
Critics pointed out that Deen contin-
ued to promote her Southern food after her diagnosis and came forward with the news the same day she announced her partnership with Novo Nordisk.
Kathryn Parker, director of the Shands at UF Diabetes Self-Management Program, thinks the criticism is ridicu-lous.
“I’m not sure what everyone’s so 
mad about,” Parker said. “She’s working 
with a phenomenal pharmaceutical com-pany, and if she can enlighten the 60 mil-lion Americans who 
don’t know they have diabetes, then more power to her.”
More than 28 mil-
lion people know they 
have diabetes, Parker said, but the dan-ger lies with those who are unaware that they are diabetic or pre-diabetic.
Unlike diseases with obvious physi-
cal symptoms, diabetes is silent and only surfaces during a complication, she said.
Though genetics plays a role in 
whether someone is at risk for diabetes, Parker said eating too much is the pri-mary cause.
She said if a woman’s waist is more 
than 35 inches or if a man’s is more than 40 inches, he or she is at a higher risk for getting Type 2 diabetes. 
Blake Livingston, 24, was born with 
Type 1 diabetes, which Parker said af-fects about 10 percent of diabetics. He said if Deen wants to keep her reputation and take the drug company’s money, she needs to show healthy food options.
Livingston, a UF graduate student 
studying to become an acute care prac-titioner, said people need to get advice from their doctors instead of advertise-ments and broadcast personalities.

“She was yelling,” Jones said. “She was like, 
‘Yes, DeCara, I don’t like you. That’s why I 
looked at you like that.’”
Lewis then walked into her friend’s apart-
ment. Jones went to her own and hung out on the back porch, where she and friends ate Taco Bell and smoked cigarettes.
About 15 minutes later, Lewis walked by. 
Jones’ porch looks out onto Southwest Third Avenue, where Lewis’ car was parked.
“What’s up,” Jones said.Lewis screamed, threatening to run Jones 
and her friends over. She started her car, pulled a U-turn and stopped in front of the porch, Jones said. Lewis repeatedly drove forward and reversed, yelling at Jones and her friends.
“She just kept telling me to get in the middle 
of the road,” Jones said.
Instead, Jones’ friend Cornelia Dean walked 
to the brick sidewalk. Dean, a psychology and classics junior, also happened to be friends with Lewis.
“Get out of the car or go home,” Dean said.Lewis didn’t. She gunned it. The right side 
of the car hopped over the curb and Lewis steered toward Dean.
Dean jumped, landing face-first on the windshield. She lay across the hood, legs dan-gling off the front. Lewis drove for about 50 feet, according to police.
“You know how people say their life flashes 
before their eyes?” Dean asked. “Literally, my life flashed before me. I was on top, thinking, ‘OK, I’m on this vehicle. How am I going to get off?’ Luckily, I have quick reflexes, or this could have been like 100 times worse.”
She fell off of the hood, breaking her right 
wrist. But Lewis kept coming, she said. Dean had to roll out of the way before getting hit again.
Jones, meanwhile, watched the whole event 
from the porch.
“I was the one she was having problems 
with,” Jones said. “I was the farthest person from her. I was just hanging back on the pa-tio.”
Lewis was charged with aggravated battery. 
She declined to comment Thursday evening.
Lewis was featured in a January 2010 edi-
tion of the Alligator. She participated in the Writing on the Wall Project, during which she was asked to write a hurtful statement on a brick on the Reitz Union North Lawn.
She wrote “WhoRE” on her brick.“I think we tend to prejudge others and go 
off what they have on rather than who they are,” she said at the time. FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 11

David Bergstein, spokesman for 
the Florida Democratic Party, said 
this bill targets Democratic voters, including students and low-income residents.
“The only reason the Republicans 
are trying to keep people from voting is because they know people won’t be voting for them,” said Bergstein, 23. “They know they can’t win in a fair fight, so they are trying to stack the deck.”
Erin Murphy, president of UF Col-
lege Democrats, said the restrictions make registering people to vote un-necessarily complicated.
“When you are trying to register 
hundreds or thousands of voters, it can be very complex to turn in those forms downtown within 48 hours,” Murphy said. 
The Florida Democratic Party 
plans on registering the voters they need under the new laws, Bergstein said.
UF College Democrats registered 
more than 1,000 people on the last day of voter registration in 2008, she said, and 250 students registered last semester.
Some students say the bill will eliminate voter fraud and will lead to a more efficient voting process.
“I really don’t think it is going to 
affect college students greatly,” said Matt Pesek, 19-year-old UF religion and political science sophomore and public relations officer for College Re-publicans. “At least for the meantime, these laws will make Florida elections more credible.”
The law ensures the supervisor of 
elections knows who is being regis-tered and that the process is complet-ed in a timely manner, he said.
“Just because a bank has never 
been robbed doesn’t mean it doesn’t upgrade its security,” said Brian Hughes, spokesman for the Republi-can Party of Florida.
He said voter fraud does still hap-
pen, and in November, the FBI arrest-ed eight people, including the super-visor of elections, for illegally casting absentee ballots in Madison County.
“We will get used to these laws 
and hopefully not find ways around them,” Pesek said.Vote , from page 1

Florida sophomore defensive tackle 
Leon Orr was served with a notice to ap-
pear on two marijuana-related charges during the first week of Spring semester, according to a University Police Depart-ment report.
The arrest report describes a scene on 
the night of Jan. 10 in which UPD officer Bradley Roberts searched Orr’s dorm room in building eight of Keys Complex about a half hour before midnight. During the search, which Orr consented to, Roberts found a “baggy of a green leafy substance, a glass pipe and rolling papers” on Orr’s desk and bedside table.
The substance was tested and con-
firmed to be marijuana. After being read his rights, Orr admitted to ownership of the marijuana, pipe and papers, according to the report.
There was no information in the report 
indicating why police were alerted to Orr’s dorm room.
He is being charged with possession of 
less than 20 grams of marijuana and pos-session of drug paraphernalia, both misde-meanors. Orr’s court date is set for Feb. 8 at 9 a.m.
Orr is the ninth arrest, and eighth player 
arrested, since Will Muschamp took over for Urban Meyer as Gators head coach. Six of those arrests have been for marijuana.
“Coach (Muschamp) is aware of the in-
cident and has handled the matter,” team spokesman Dan Apple said.
A redshirt freshman last season, Orr 
registered 10 tackles and a sack.
Originally from the Clearwater area, 
Orr was rated the No. 11 defensive tackle in the nation by Rivals.com.
Thursday night, Orr posted a message 
on his Twitter account (@MrLrgJack_44) that read: “At the end of the day a mistake was made, and I’ve learned from it.” 
The background photo for Orr’s Twitter 
page showed him wearing a backward hat, sunglasses and a T-shirt with a design that includes a marijuana leaf.

When Mike Rosario was at Rut-
gers, playing weak defense was the 
only way he could play more min-utes.
On a Big East team just trying to 
stay afloat most nights, Rosario would save his energy for the offensive end, where he carried the Scarlet Knights’ shooting and scoring loads for two years. 
“I had to basically be an offensive 
threat the whole game in order for us to stay in the game and in order for us to try and win,” Rosario said. “Plus, playing 37 to 40 minutes a game and plus trying to do both ends of the court, it was a little bit too much for me.”
After transferring to Florida, Ro-
sario soon realized his days of lack-adaisical defense had to be over if he wanted to avoid moving further down UF’s bench, and worse, into coach Billy Donovan’s dog house.
In his first five games, Rosario 
played 20 or more minutes three times against mostly over-matched compe-tition. But as the Gators hit the meat of their non-conference schedule, Rosario improving defense

Jordan Jones released a shot from the mid-
court Gators logo as the shot-clock buzzer 
sounded.
The redshirt senior guard’s desperation 
heave found nothing but net, kicking off a 23-2 first-half Florida run that buried Ala-bama.
“Kind of lucky, I guess,” Jones said of the 
shot.
Good fortune and solid transition play 
helped Florida (13-6, 3-3 Southeastern Confer -
ence) defeat Alabama (10-10, 0-6 SEC) 61-37 on Thursday night in the O’Connell Center.
Florida went into halftime with a 33-17 
lead, marking the second consecutive game the Gators have scored 30-plus points in the first half.
The quick starts against LSU and Alabama 
came on the heels of back-to-back losses to South Carolina and Georgia in which Florida failed to reach 20 points before the half.“First and foremost, (the problem) was 
turnovers,” coach Amanda Butler said. “We’ve just been valuing each possession more. We’ve been paying more attention to our offense in practice and taking a little bit away from our defense.”
Butler may have had offense at the fore-
front of her gameplan this week, but UF’s 
defense delivered arguably its best performance of the 2011-12 campaign against the Crimson Tide.
Alabama’s 17 first-half 
points were the fewest 
scored by a Florida oppo-nent this season, and the Tide’s final tally of 37 was 
the lowest number allowed by the Gators since 2009.
The key stretch was a 5:14 scoreless 
drought by the Crimson Tide in the first half that saw the Gators rack up 13 unanswered points.Florida blows past Alabama

  Now healthy, Florida guard Mike Rosario has improved his effort on defense, helping 
UF hold Georgia and South Carolina to less than 40 percent combined shooting. 
Donovan praises Rosario’s progress
Rosario’s minutes declined due to his poor 
effort on the defensive end of the ﬂ  oor.
  Heading into No. 17 Florida’s (14-4, 2-1 
Southeastern Conference) home clash with LSU (12-6, 2-2 SEC) on Saturday at 6 p.m., Donovan said he has seen a change in the ju-nior guard’s approach to playing tough de-fense.
  “It’s all stemmed from practice — he’s 
really been pretty consistent, pretty respon-sible, pretty reliable,” Donovan said. “He’s built up a lot of trust in myself and his team-mates. I think earlier in the year, probably, some of his limited minutes had to do with a lot of his defensive focus.”
  While ankle and back injuries slowed his 
progress during the last month, a ﬁ  nally healthy Rosario recorded three steals in UF’s wins against Georgia and at South Carolina last week.
  As a result, Donovan was able to play Ro-
sario for 19 minutes against the Gamecocks, enough time for him to reach double ﬁ  gures for the ﬁ  rst time since Dec. 7. Rosario said his coach recognized how hard he was work-ing and how far he would go to change his game.
  “It bothered me a little bit because it hurts 
me — the fact that I can’t go out there and compete to my best of abilities for my team-mates and the program,” Rosario said. “I’m embracing the fact that I can do that, and now I know when I come off the bench, I can spark the game and take the game to another level.”
  With Rosario ﬁ  nally buying in to Dono-
van’s philosophy, the Gators have held their last two opponents — Georgia and South Carolina — to a combined 39.1 percent shoot-ing.
  Florida will have the chance to extend its 
strong defensive run against LSU this week-end, which comes into Gainesville with the third-worst ﬁ  eld goal percentage in the SEC.
  “One of the most important things is 
guarding the ball and guarding off the ball, so that’s what I’ve been trying to conquer the last couple weeks,” Rosario said. “When I get in the game, I bring a lot of energy to that as-pect of the game, especially to the defensive end. I feel it could bring positive energy to my teammates.”

Heading into Southeastern Con-
ference play, the Gators prefer to fo-
cus on themselves rather than their opponents.
Coach Rhonda Faehn said No. 
8 Florida (2-0) isn’t concerned with how well Kentucky (2-2, 0-1 SEC) performs when the Gators visit the Wildcats at the Memorial Coliseum in Lexington, Ky ., tonight at 7 p.m. 
“We don’t ever necessarily look at 
whom we’re going against because we can’t control who that is,” Faehn said. “We have our job to do. Each athlete knows where they want to make improvements, or what their goal is.”
The Gators are coming off two 
impressive victories — a 196.025-194.675 road win against North Car -
olina State on Jan. 6 and a 196.175-191.875 throttling of Illinois-Chicago in their home opener last Friday . 
Kentucky’s season, on the other 
hand, hasn’t begun as smoothly. The Wildcats, who entered the season ranked 23rd in the nation, placed second in their opening quad meet at home against Bowling Green and Wisconsin-Oshkosh, but  finished behind No. 10 Oklahoma. 
Last Friday , UK was stomped by 
No. 3 Arkansas in its SEC opener, 196.650 to 191.975. 
The Wildcats are also getting ac-
customed to rookie head coach Tim Garrison, who previously served as an assistant coach at Nebraska for five years. 
Despite a rough start, Kentucky 
might end up being UF’s toughest challenge so far this season. 
But Florida isn’t focused on how 
Big Blue Nation’s team performs. 
“The mindset is just to compete 
just like we’ve trained,” sophomore Alaina Johnson said. “(We’re going to) just go out there and stay in our own little bubble.”
For UF’s top-ranked freshman 
class, tonight’s meet will serve as an introduction to the SEC, which cur -
rently features six of the nation’s top 25 teams. Kentucky is ranked sev-enth in the league with a team aver -
age of 193.150. 
“I’m not really thinking about 
competing against an SEC school,” freshman Kytra Hunter said. “I’m just thinking about doing my rou-tines to the best of my ability.”
Faehn said tonight’s event line-
ups will look different from last Fri-day’s rotations against UIC.
Hunter will not be an all-around 
competitor for the first time this year, Johnson will make her 2012 vault debut and juniors Ashanée Dickerson and Marissa King will compete as all-arounders. 
Also, sophomore Mackenzie 
Caquatto is set to make her return to beam after she suffered an ankle injury at the final selection camp for the U.S. world championships team in September.
Although Faehn said she wants 
the Gators to stick more landings and get better handstands on un-even bars, she doesn’t want them to use up all of their strength against the Wildcats.
“We don’t want anybody out 
there at their full-blown best right now,” Faehn said. “There’s three months of season left.” FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 19

current indoor Southeastern Conference champion, set a new Birmingham Crossplex and school record for distance in shot put at last week’s Ala-bama Invitational, the team’s first meet of the season. 
The five-time All-American 
broke his old university record of 19.53m/64-1 with an NCAA qualifying mark of 19.95m/65-05.50. Mesic’s throw was almost three meters longer than his closest competitor and helped him earn SEC Men’s Field Ath-lete of the Week honors. 
“It feels great. It shows that 
you trained hard successfully over the past fall,” Mesic said. “So everything comes together and you are happy , of course.” 
The 6-foot-6, 275-pound 
Mesic is a native of Sarajevo, Bosnia, where he was active in track and field for six years be-fore college. He has been com-peting for UF since 2008. 
An unlikely Florida trans-
plant, Mesic, 26, said that the number of participants in track and field in his home country is growing, despite still recover -
ing from the destruction caused by the Bosnian War.
“Here in the United States, you have a lot more opportuni-ties to be good, to be better, and to be the best,” he said. “Most people over there don’t have the opportunities that kids have here in the United States, I’m really blessed to be here.” 
Mesic said he was grateful 
for the opportunities that the Florida track and field program has provided him.
He attributes part of his 
success to his pregame ritual of heavy concentration and lis-tening to music from his home country . Before he steps into the circle to throw the 16-pound shot, Mesic concentrates solely on the task at hand and visual-izes his goal.
After competing in track 
and field on the collegiate level, 
Mesic has plans to be an Olympian, 
continuing to train hard so he can r e p r e s e n t Bosnia in the future.
Mesic, de-
spite his personal accomplish-ments, said he enjoys being part of a team and competing for his university . 
While Mesic won’t be in ac-
tion this Sunday when Florida hits James G. Pressly Stadium for the Gator Invite, he had a message for his competitors. 
“It was good to put the (re-
cord-setting) mark out there, so the other guys, who are train-ing hard too, can see that I am ready and that they have to be a little bit scared of the Gators,” he said. “We’re going to come for them.” Mesic breaking own

In last Sunday’s 62-58 win 
against the Tigers, the Gators saw 
a late 14-point lead whittled down to two in just four minutes.
However, Florida actually add-
ed to its advantage in the second half Thursday due largely to im-proved post play.
The Gators bested the Crimson 
Tide by only two points, 14-12, in the paint before halftime, surren-dering eight points to ‘Bama for -
ward Kyra Crosby.
Conversely, Florida dominated 
down low in the second half, out-scoring Alabama 18-8 in the paint.
Junior forward Jennifer George 
and senior center Azania Stewart led the Gators’ effort in the post. George recorded her 11th double-double of the season, registering team-high marks with 15 points, 12 rebounds and five blocked shots.
While the Gators warmly wel-
comed George’s return to dou-ble-double form a game after she struggled with six points and two rebounds against LSU, Stewart’s performance drew the most enthu-siastic praise.
Stewart scored eight points, 
pulled down 10 boards and re-corded four blocks in her best all-around statistical performance in SEC play this season.
“It’s about time, I should say,” 
Stewart said. “It’s great confidence, just for our team in general. We’re building and we’re on a run right now.”
George has shouldered Florida’s 
offensive burden in the paint, pro-viding the only consistent scoring threat for the Gators down low.
However, Stewart’s perfor -mance, coupled with eight points from redshirt senior Ndidi Madu, has George brimming with confi-dence in her fellow post players.
“[Stewart]’s hitting her stride 
right now. It’s pretty hard to guard both of us if we’re both on our strides,” George said. “Her block-ing and her height challenge a lot of teams.”

STAFF REPORT
Sunday will mark almost 
one year since the last time 
Florida’s men’s tennis team faced Baylor, but when the teams square off, the circum-stances will be nearly identi-cal. 
The No. 8 Gators will take 
the long trip to Waco, Texas, 
this weekend where they will face the No. 5 Bears in their first dual match of the season. 
Following a solid show-
ing at the Southeastern Con-ference Indoor Champion-ships in Lexington, Ky., last week, the Gators will begin their dual-match schedule with a challenging out-of-conference opponent. Last year, Florida defeated Baylor 5-2, when the doubles team of Sekou Bangoura Jr. and Andrew Butz won a thrilling match to clinch the win.
This year’s Bears boast 
three of the top 125 singles players in the country, in-cluding the trio of No. 20 Mate Zsiga, No. 52 Lars Be-hlen and No. 54 Roberto Maytin. 
Zsiga and Behlen are 
freshmen from Europe, the former coming from Hun-gary and the latter coming from Germany. 
Last year, Maytin was de-
feated in singles by Florida’s Nassim Slilam.
The Gators will also be rolling out three players of their own in the national top 125 for singles. Junior Bob van Overbeek, sophomore Spencer Newman and sopho-more Andrew Butz will lead the charge of Gators looking to repeat last year’s success. 
Florida’s No. 4 doubles 
team of Nassim Slilam and Billy Federhofer will also be in action following an exit in the Round of 16 at the SEC Indoor Championships. 
B a y l o r ’ s No. 17 team of Maytin and Marko 
K r i c k o v i c likely will be their op-ponents. 
T r y i n g 
to ride a 
hot start to the spring season will be sophomore Michael Alford, who won the con-solation singles title at the SEC Indoors last weekend. The Tampa native won five straight matches after drop-ping his opener in Lexing-ton.
Meanwhile, the women’s 
team is preparing to open with its first dual match on Wednesday when it hosts Troy University at Linder Stadium.
The team was last in action 
last weekend at the Freeman Memorial Championships in Las Vegas, where junior Caroline Hitimana took the consolation singles title.
