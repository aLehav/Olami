ESPN columnist, sports analyst and radio host Stephen A. Smith speaks to students at the Phillips Center for the Per-forming Arts on Wednesday night.

Stephen A. Smith was greeted with a standing ova-
tion when he arrived at the Phillips Center for the Per-
forming Arts on Wednesday night.
Smith is the co-host of the popular program “First 
Take” on ESPN 2. His presentation included his thoughts 
on becoming successful in corporate America.
“I don’t believe I’m negative,” Smith said. “I believe 
I’m real.”
He encouraged students to work hard and ﬁ  ght ad-
versity.
Smith said students should understand the world 
they are living in and act accordingly. He also spoke 
about the importance of creating a brand.
After an audience question about journalists being 
censored by networks, Smith spoke at length about his recent weeklong suspension by ESPN after his on-air comments about Ray Rice’s domestic violence situa-tion.
Smith said he chose his words poorly but did not 
think he deserved to be suspended after his comments.
“Under no circumstances should you put your hands 
on a woman,“ he said at the event.
Hena Patel, a 20-year-old UF nutritional sciences stu-
dent, said she didn’t know much about Smith before the event.
“I thought it would be weird since I didn’t know any-
thing about sports, but I really liked it,” Patel said. “He really told people a lot of things that they don’t normally think about like the real world.”ESPN presenter speaks about success, hard work

After slashing teen smoking rates 
by more than 50 percent within 14 years, Florida is now home to the low-est percentage of high school smokers in the nation.
At the turn of the century, about 
15.7 percent of state high school stu-dents said they had smoked a cigarette at least once within 30 days, according to a study conducted by Florida Health and Tobacco Free Florida. This year only 7.5 percent of high schoolers said the same — the lowest in the country.
“Smoking is the No. 1 preventative 
cause of death, usually in the form of heart disease or cancer,” said Andrew Romero, a health policy specialist at To-
bacco Free Alachua. 
One-ﬁ  fth of U.S. deaths are due to 
smoking, Romero said, which adds up 
to about 443,000 a year. 
This week, the largest national 
youth smoking-prevention campaign, “truth,” released the ﬁ  rst of eight na-tionwide commercials, which show-cased Florida’s low teen-smoking rate. 
Robin Koval, the CEO and presi-
dent of Legacy — the national public health foundation that directs and funds “truth” — said the campaign ﬁ  rst launched in August and aims to Florida leads nation in 
fewest teenage smokers

Students can get a job in their pajamas to-
day.
The UF Career Resource Center is hosting 
its ﬁ  rst virtual career fair for students inter-
ested in pursuing a health profession.
Students are able to register at any time 
for the event being held from noon to 4 p.m. 
Students can use their cellphones, tablets 
or computers to access the career fair.
Monica Moreno, the center’s assistant 
director of recruitment services, said she is excited to team up with Brazen Careerist, 
an online virtual event platform, to host the 
fair. Moreno said students, employers and 
recruiters will not need a camera to partici-pate.
“It’s a chat feature. You go into a chat-
room with an employer and you stand in line at their virtual booth, and then they start talking to you,” she said. 
“We wanted to make sure we created 
something for students who were not able to come to campus,” she continued. 
Students can upload their resume and 
then their proﬁ  le will be available for the employer to view.
“I’m glad to see that they are catering to 
health professionals,” said Joi Johnson, a 21-
year-old UF health education and behavior 
senior. 
“I’m not able to be on campus as much, so

� THIRTY DOGS ARE LOOK-
ING FOR HOMES.
CHABELI HERRERA
Alligator Staff Writer cherrera@alligator.org
A few weeks ago, a family fell 
in love with a dog.
She was a little black runt 
named Petry — like the ﬂ  ying, 
panicky Pteranodon in “The Land Before Time” — and one of a new litter of  ﬁ  ve cheerful, even-tem-pered puppies at Gainesville non-proﬁ  t Plenty of Pit Bulls.
After Petry’s adoption, the fam-
ily followed up with the organi-zation, writing to say they loved their new puppy. But when Petry’s DNA tests came in, everything changed. 
The puppy was 50-percent pit 
bull, according to the test, even though pit bull is not a breed, but a classiﬁ  cation of dogs with a certain body type.
“And they said, ‘We don’t want 
her anymore,’” said Plenty of Pit Bulls volunteer JoAnna Platzer. “It was the same puppy they always had, and they returned her.” 
Petry was one of seven dogs 
who were returned to Plenty of 
Pit Bulls in recent weeks, reaching 
one of the organization’s highest saturation points since opening in 2010. 
The nonproﬁ  t cooperates with 
local shelters to place pit bulls into foster homes until they are adopt-ed. The organization doesn’t have a central shelter so instead heavily relies on full-time foster volunteers and adoption ambassadors, who take the dogs out for walks and in-troduce them to people in hopes of ﬁ  nding permanent homes. 
Plenty of Pit Bulls now has 30 dogs looking for homes at a time when fosters go out of town for the holidays. With so many dogs and so little space, the organization is 
in desperate need of foster volun-
teers and viable adoptees before 
its members will be forced to take 
on multiple dogs or send some to kennels.
Anna Peterson, a member of the 
organization’s board of directors 
and a religion professor at UF, said 
the two biggest problems Plenty of Pit Bulls faces are misconceptions 
about pit bulls and landlord breed 
restrictions.“If you’re going to restrict 
someone, pit bulls are on the list,” Peterson said. “We think all dogs should be treated as individuals. 
We don’t think breed is a very ac-
curate guide to behavior.” 
Although pit bulls face a cer-
tain stigma, Peterson said the one common thread she’s found while 
working with the dogs is that they 
are all very people-oriented. 
“They tend to be really affec-
tionate, attached and loyal to their people,” she said. 
Still, longtime Plenty of Pit Bulls 
volunteer and UF political science professor Amie Kreppel said the pit bull label turns families off from otherwise lovable dogs. 
“Black dogs don’t get adopted 
as much,” said Kreppel, who start-ed as a foster and then adopted her 
black pit bull, Poppy. “There’s rac-
ism in the animal world.” 
Platzer also said people don’t 
have the patience oftentimes to go through Plenty of Pit Bull’s adop-
tion process, which arranges a 
weeklong trial period for families to ensure the dog is its best ﬁ  t.
“A lot of people don’t under-
stand taking a dog as a responsi-bility,” Platzer said.
Currently she takes care of 
4-year-old Stella, a light brown pit bull who was returned to shelter 
by her adoptees.
She is a walking, jumping, lick-
ing example of the juxtaposition of 
the pit bull stereotype. Wednesday afternoon, she walked around the 
College Manor Apartments’ pool 
lapping the water and trying to eat 
gum off the sidewalk.
She enjoys wearing clothes — 
her Led Zeppelin shirt is her fa-
vorite — and sleeps cuddled up to 
Platzer.
“Stella is not happy unless she 
is touching you, preferably sitting on you,” said Platzer as Stella leapt 
over to 21-year-old UF public rela-
tions senior Chantelle McHugh, 
who was reading a book by the 
pool, and started licking her face.
As Stella climbed on her beach 
chair and plopped on her lap, McHugh laughed — a reaction 
Platzer is not used to.
“A lot of people, I walk her, and 
they cross the street,” Platzer said. 
Like all the organization’s dogs, 
Stella is microchipped, spayed — or neutered — and vaccinated. She 
has been awaiting adoption since 
May without any takers.
“It’s frustrating because we un-
derstand how good the dogs are,” Platzer said. 
She wants others to see it, too, 
and hopefully before she gets too 
attached to seeing Stella’s face pok-
ing out from under her covers.
“I just want her to get adopted 
before I can’t stand it,” Platzer 
said.

ing, donating or adopting can reach Plenty of Pit Bulls at gaines-

Alex Whiteside’s company can’t afford to 
compete with bigger brands like Netflix.
The 20-year-old UF computer engineering 
junior’s startup, Rile Inc., relies on speedy In-
ternet for the services it provides, like interac-
tive robots and live-stream videos that teach 
physics to middle and high school students globally.
Whiteside is one of many small business 
owners affected by net neutrality — the idea that Internet service providers should allow equal access to all content, regardless of where it came from, therefore eliminating favoritism by company or brand name.
After President Barack Obama addressed the issue in a statement Monday morning, Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz tweeted that, ”’Net Neutrality’ is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at 
the speed of government,” a statement UF 
computer and information science and engi-neering professor Richard Newman said was ill-advised. 
“If Ted Cruz really wanted the rich to get 
filthy, crazy rich, he would support the middle class and the little guys and the innovators so that they could float everybody’s boat instead of just trying to scrap up a big pile for him and 
his buddies,” Newman said.  
Newman said he believes the Internet 
should be treated like any other utility and 
should be accessible to everyone at the same cost. He added it makes sense to block sites that 
are known to be malicious, but warned that blocking should stop there. 
“When you get into that, you start down a 
slippery slope of the great firewall of China,” he said, “or like places that restrict access of their citizens to information because of politi-cal and other reasons.”
Protecting net neutrality keeps the playing 
field even, Newman said, and will help sup-
port UF student entrepreneurs like Whiteside.
“This will lower the bar and eliminate bar-
riers to entry into that world, which I think will have a positive effect on innovation and 
entrepreneurship,” he said.
Whiteside said he wants to expand his 
company in the next few years, and when he does, the protection of net neutrality will play a large role in the move.
“It would be a big issue if we suddenly 
had to pay large amounts of money for fast Internet,” Whiteside said, adding that Inter-
net service providers should not be allowed to 
grant preferential Internet speed and access to companies simply because they turn a higher profit.
“They shouldn’t be able to say, ‘Oh, well 
Netflix pays us more so they get the faster Internet speed,’” he said. “That shouldn’t be legal.”
Locals say net neutrality evens competition for small businesses
“That shouldn’t be legal.”

Michael Christ can’t stay away 
from UF’s Senate chambers.
Two weeks 
after his depar-
ture as a Mur-
phree senator 
and the last Stu-dents Party mi-
nority senator, Sen. Christ saw an opening for a graduate sen-
ate seat and couldn’t resist.
“The biggest thing for grad stu-
dents is they feel they don’t have a voice in Student Government,” he said. “They feel it’s a very under-graduate focus.”
The 21-year-old UF senior will 
graduate with a combined bach-elor’s and master’s degree in po-litical science next May, therefore qualifying for the graduate senate seat. UF Student Senate President 
Joseph Michaels voted to approve 
Christ for the graduate seat during an Oct. 28 meeting. 
Christ said he plans to slate as 
an independent.
“The reason I did that as Sen-
ate President is I always appreciate a strong voice regardless of party affiliation,” Michaels said. “He 
brings a different perspective to 
Senate, and representing grad stu-dents you have to have a different perspective.”
Christ said he will also continue 
his crusade for reduced spending in SG.
“It’s good to be back and good 
to be fighting for the issues I care about,” he said.The second coming of

A drunk man was arrested Tues-
day night after police said he peed in 
a Popeyes’ bathroom sink.
Henry Hall Jr., 44, staggered into 
the Main Street Popeyes shortly 
after 9 p.m., according to a report. His eyes were bloodshot. When he spoke, his words were slurred. 
Hall told the restaurant’s manag-
er he did not want food. Instead, he said he needed to use the bathroom. 
The manager found Hall peeing in the women’s bathroom sink and told him to leave. Hall then walked outside to smoke a cigarette. 
Police found 
Hall — cigarette in hand — and ar-rested him on charges of disorderly conduct, disorderly intoxication and trespassing. He is being held on a $10,000 bond.

A Gainesville man was arrested Tuesday after-
noon after police said he punched and strangled his live-in girlfriend.
At about 4 
p.m., Craig De-
shaun Dixon got 
into a verbal ar-
gument with his girlfriend at their home, located at 2917 NE 14th Drive. The woman told police 34-year-old Dixon was leaving her and packing his things when he smashed a bottle of cologne on the bedroom wall. With a closed fist, Dixon began 
punching the woman in the face over and over. When the woman went to call police, Dixon grabbed her by her hair, pulled her back into the bedroom and continued to punch her in the face. 
“You don’t love me anymore,” 
Dixon said to the woman. “You’re trying to leave me.”
He then wrapped his hands 
around her throat. 
“I’m going to let you be with 
God since you love him so much,” he said. Police said the woman had a 
6-inch cut on her neck and a tennis ball-sized lump on her forehead. 
After Dixon was arrested and 
put in a patrol car, he began hitting his head against the barrier separat-ing the front seats from the back. He 
then had to be restrained using a rip 
hobble, which is a strap to hold one’s legs together near the ankle.
Dixon was arrested on charges of 
battery, domestic battery by strangu-lation and preventing someone from calling 911. His bond is currently set at $85,000. 
Police roundup: intoxication, trespassing; domestic violence
The rates dropped by more than 50 percent in past 14 years
empower teens against tobacco use.
“We want to remind them that their generation has the 
power to accelerate the decline in youth smoking and even end it for good,” Koval said in an emailed statement. 
Residents of Alachua County can utilize three methods to 
help them quit smoking, Romero said: calling a quitline, attend-ing an in-person help session or taking an online course. All of these have helped lower Florida’s smoking rates, he said. Romero said Tobacco Free Alachua enters high school halls 
through its program Students Working Against Tobacco, which hosts one-on-one interactions with students and works toward eliminating tobacco use in youth.  
“It’s a way for students to make a difference and stand up to 
an industry that targets them,” Romero said.  
The program is in effect at local high schools like Gainesville 
and Buchholz.
“It teaches youth how to be a successful community leader,” 
Romero said. Only 8.6 percent of UF students smoke cigarettes, he said, 
and because college students serve as role models for high schoolers, it may act as another reason why young state-smok-er rates dropped.
Lisa Craig, the local American Heart Association spokes-
woman, said people tend to forget smoking can lead to severe heart problems. The association regularly lobbies for more 
smoke-free public places like restaurants.
“We try to create a culture of change from all aspects,” Craig 
said. SmoKing , from page 1Hall

When she was an energetic third-grad-
er, Margo Klar had the chance to invent 
something. She decided to make a folder for her kitchen sink that holds all utensils and takes up little space.
As a senior at the University of Califor-
nia, Irvine, she created a medical device for people with sleep apnea.
Now as a doctoral student at UF, she 
invented a Ceramic Cord Cutting Device, known as  C3D. The reusable umbilical cutter doesn’t rust and can be easily ster-ilized and used safely to prevent harm-ing the newborn, mother and health care 
worker.
This time, Klar received about half a 
million dollars for her idea.
Klar, 31, was awarded $493,000 by the 
phase II of Grand Challenges Explorations, 
an initiative created by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that rewards innovative ideas in global health research.
“I have always really enjoyed problem 
solving and coming up with solutions,” said Klar, a student in the department of epidemiology at the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions and the UF College of Medicine.
In 2011, Klar was awarded a phase I grant to develop the prototype for the C3D.
“Because of the success of phase one, I 
had to apply for the second phase,” Klar 
said. “We had all indications pointing to-
ward going forward.”
The grant will be used to introduce C3D 
to health care workers in seven countries including Thailand, India, Kenya and Pak-istan.
About 4 million children die during the 
neonatal period, according to the World Health Organization. Infections are the 
major cause of death, and hygienic prac-
tices could reduce about 1 million of them, Klar said.
“This affects more than the baby,” she 
said. “This affects the family and the com-munity as a whole.”
But Klar said in most cases, resources 
are scarce so donated blades or scalpels from aid agencies are reused and can lead 
to contamination.
“People will use whatever they can get 
their hands on when resources are lim-
ited,” she said. “It could be glass shards, machetes or kitchen knives. It’s survival mode.”
Klar had a team of UF professors and 
researchers working to help her on the project, including Deepthi Varma, a re-
search assistant scientist in the epidemiol-ogy department.
“I believe these are the kind of projects 
that will help to elevate UF to the global stage as a pioneering institute that nurture 
students to develop and implement life-saving ideas,” Varma said.THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

leges.
The Daily Beast based each 
university’s happiness ranking on retention rate, overall student experience and a student health 
center. It used the website Niche, 
which contains student reviews and polls, for both rankings.UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said UF is considered a happy col-
lege because of its high retention 
rate.
The Daily Beast reported a 
96-percent retention rate for UF, which is a strong indicator in de-termining students’ happiness, 
and UF’s is historically high, he said.
“The student experience comes 
from not just what happens in the 
classroom,” Orlando said.
UF received a score of 6.3 out 
of 10 for attractive guys and a 7 out of 10 for attractive girls on the site’s sexiest colleges ranking.
Jordan Thomas, a 21-year-old 
UF chemical engineering senior, said UF’s sexiness and happiness 
rankings are both something to 
take notice of nationally.
“Our school’s southern charm 
is a huge feature of our sexiness factor,” Thomas said. “The stu-dents here are happy because we 
attend such a prestigious college 
where our future opportunities are endless.”
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, assis-
tance vice president for UF stu-dent affairs, collects data about UF students.
She said Student Experience in 
the Research University is a sur-vey UF uses to gauge students’ happiness and satisfaction with 
their school. The results are com-
pared with other Association of American Universities members.
Mastrodicasa said the qualities 
that make UF a happy place are its athletics, the number of student organizations and its diverse Stu-dent Body.    
“Students are much more sat-
isfied with their social experience when they can connect, be leaders and choose to engage outside the 
classroom,” she said.
Sixty-nine percent of UF stu-dents said they are satisfied with 
their social experience compared 
to 64 percent of the AAU mem-
bers.
Mastrodicasa said this survey 
has been consistent the past three years, and it is about to be distrib-uted for 2014.
Michael Tessitore, a 20-year-
old UF political science and eco-nomics junior, said UF students are probably a lot happier than students at Ivy League schools.
“Having an Ivy League degree 
always looks good in hindsight, but a lot of those students are actually miserable because their 
work is so hard and time consum-
ing,” Tessitore said.

UF scientists produced three new breed-
ing lines of tomatoes as result of a more than 
$2 million, 25-year project.
Scientists at the UF Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences Gulf Coast Research 
and Education Center in Balm, Florida, pro-
duced these virus-resistant tomatoes. 
The UF/IFAS Cultivar Release Committee 
partnered with the Florida Foundation Seed Producers, Inc. to approve the three breeding lines Oct. 22.
John Scott, professor of horticultural sci-
ences and tomato breeder at the center, said these new virus-resistant lines will eventu-ally help farmers protect their crop against 
the tomato yellow leaf curl virus, which is 
transmitted by whiteflies and can cause total crop loss for farmers.
“These tomatoes give breeders better op-
tions to breed more durable resistance, which will make it harder for the virus to mutate against,” Scott said.
The researchers screened about 15,000 
plants, taking tissue and DNA from each, to 
produce these three lines, Scott said. 
Assistant professor of horticultural sci-
ences and tomato breeder Samuel Hutton, 
who worked with Scott on the study, said the virus is the biggest disease impacting Florida tomatoes.
“Ideally, company breeders will use these 
breeding lines as parents to develop finished varieties that will go to the market,” Horton 
said.IFAS researchers produce

Net neutrality critical to American future
In recent months, the media have ampliﬁ  ed the exis-
tence of a number of supposed threats to the safety and well-being of ordinary Americans, most prominently 
Ebola and the terrorist group ISIS.
However, the media have, until recently, largely ig-
nored a much more serious and relevant issue of direct importance to any American with an Internet connection: net neutrality. For a while, the debate over net neutrality has been carried out in relative obscurity, as the concept is lofty, laden with technical computer jargon and doesn’t seem to affect common people directly.
Basically, the conﬂ  ict comes down to this: Should Inter-
net access be treated as a utility or as a commodity?
The net neutrality debate exists because the companies 
that provide Internet access — which happen to also be cable companies — want to treat it as a commodity. These Internet service providers (ISPs) would like to commodify Internet access further by creating artiﬁ  cial “fast lanes,” or routes through which content providers (Netﬂ  ix, Fa-cebook, Reddit etc.) that are able and willing to pay the ISPs extra money can funnel their information. Those who don’t pay would get left behind, forced to either give in to the ISPs’ demands or completely disappear from view.
The implications of this policy go beyond an extra 
stufﬁ  ng of cable executives’ pockets. This kind of control would allow the cable companies and ISPs to control the ﬂ  ow of content on the most incredible information-sharing system since the printing press.
And it isn’t far-fetched to see how ISPs could use this 
leverage to their nefarious beneﬁ  ts. Earlier this year, Com-cast steadily declined its streaming speeds while in an in-tense legal battle with Netﬂ  ix over fees. Once Netﬂ  ix gave into Comcast’s demands, speeds went back up again.
With that in mind, it’s easy to see why supporting an 
open, free Internet should be a no-brainer for most folks. Unless the existence of your trust fund depends on ill-got-ten cable proﬁ  ts, net neutrality is in your best interest and in the best interest of American society.
Right now, the Federal Com-
munications Commission can’t fully enforce net neutrality. The Internet is still legally deﬁ  ned as an “information service,” which for our purposes can be deﬁ  ned as “not a utility.”
But people are working hard 
at changing this.
FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has been working on a 
solution for some time and is expected to reach a ﬁ  nal proposal soon. Wheeler was a cable lobbyist before his appointment as FCC chairman, so the likelihood of the FCC classifying Internet access as a utility is low. Instead, Wheeler will likely propose some kind of middle ground in an attempt to placate both sides of the debate.
On Monday, President Obama issued a statement for-
mally coming out in favor of net neutrality. While the announcement — like many such statements in the past — was mostly empty posturing that could’ve come a lot sooner, it still carries weight.
It’s possible that with his inﬂ  uence within the gov-
ernment and his own party waning, the president feels vaguely responsible for how the Internet will look after he leaves ofﬁ  ce.
Sen. Ted Cruz already tweeted a negative response to 
Obama’s statement, calling net neutrality the “Obamacare of the Internet.” This comparison would barely make sense to someone completely ignorant of what these two things mean. Cruz’s ignorance exempliﬁ  es the threat posed to net neutrality, not only by politicians whose campaigns were funded by Comcast, but also the voters who support them.

mental illness 
more sensibly
On Oct. 28, Gretna, Florida, resident Juanita Donald called 
911. She was requesting help in transferring her mental-ly ill son, Kadrick Donald, to the Apalchee Center after 
Kadrick refused to take his medication.
Just a short time later, Kadrick was fatally shot by a police 
ofﬁ  cer in the Donald family’s home.
According to a report from WCTV, Juanita said Kadrick 
walked away from the ofﬁ  cer who arrived at the home, acting like he “didn’t want to be bothered.”
Juanita said the ofﬁ  cer then “just grabbed him, and he tased 
him. Then when he grabbed him and tased him, he rushed my son off in the bathroom, and I heard three shots. I was like, ‘You shot my son’ and he was like, ‘I had to.’ I said, ‘No, you didn’t have to.’”
Reports indicate up to 50 percent of Americans killed in con-
frontations with police have some type of mental illness. This tragically high ﬁ  gure is largely a result of a broken American mental health care system and a police force that is inadequately trained to deal with those suffering from a mental illness.
Massive cutbacks to public spending on mental health care 
that began during the Reagan administration have led to severe shortcomings in access to badly needed care for the mentally ill.
Even for those who can afford private health insurance, cov-
erage of mental health care is devastatingly sparse. In many cases, insurance plans cover up to only 50 percent of the costs of treatment for mental illness, much less than the coverage for physical health issues. Without the proper health care infrastruc-ture, the responsibility of dealing with the mentally ill often falls to America’s law enforcement agencies, which are often com-pletely incapable of effectively handling such cases.
Police should obviously be allowed to protect themselves in 
confrontations with violent, mentally ill people in which ofﬁ  cers’ 
lives are threatened. However, in many cases like the Donald in-
cident, ofﬁ  cers resort to deadly force because they are simply not trained to properly handle the mentally ill.
There are some bright spots in this dark situation: The Af-
fordable Care Act provides increased funding for mental health services. The law’s expansion of Medicaid will also reduce the number of Americans who are unable to receive mental health care because of the exorbitant ﬁ  nancial costs. In addition, many police departments are instituting training programs to teach 
their ofﬁ  cers about interacting with the mentally ill, with a focus 
on understanding and treatment rather than violence.
Regardless of any improvements or changes that are made to 
public health services or insurance coverage, Americans suffer-ing from mental illness will continue to be victims of unneces-sary police violence unless the police themselves change.
Law enforcement ofﬁ  cers must view the instigation of vio-
lence against the mentally ill as an absolute last resort, especially if the individual in question is unarmed and nonthreatening, as Kadrick was. Americans suffering from mental illness deserve proper care and treatment, not excessive and needless violence.

Improv artists and come-
dians will cruise into town 
this weekend for a show un-
like anything Gainesville has 
seen before.
The Upright Citi-
zens Brigade Tour-
ing Co. will perform 
at the High Dive at 8 p.m. Sunday. The company, composed of performers from 
New York and Los 
Angeles, has toured around the country, and its perfor-mances are fueled by audi-
ence suggestions. 
“Let Gainesville know 
that we’ll probably end up 
in Midtown wearing coconut bras and grass skirts after the 
show,” said Mike Kelton, one 
of the actors in the troupe.
Improvisation, or improv, 
is a form of live theater with 
actors who perform on the 
spot without any prior re-hearsal.
“I’m just the mom in the 
front driving the minivan 
right now,” the 27-year-old 
said.
 The plot is typically cre-
ated from something that 
audience members suggest, 
which is why every improv performance is unique.
“We pick up on absurdi-ties in everyday life and take them to the next level,” he said. “It’s relatable, and that’s what makes it so funny.”
Jenny St. Angelo, an-
other 27-year-old actor in the group, graduated from Southern Methodist Univer-
sity in Texas with 
a degree in theater. 
When she joined the Upright Citizens Bri-gade Touring Co., she 
realized she loved be-
ing an improv actor.
“It allows me to 
make people laugh, which I love to do,” she said.
When it comes to charac-
ters, the sky’s the limit for improv actors because they can be whomever or what-
ever they want, as long as it 
works with the scene, St. An-gelo explained.
“I played a chicken once,” 
she said. “Now that was in-
teresting.”
Tickets for the show can 
be purchased from the High 
Dive website. General ad-
mission tickets are $16 online 
and $18 at the door. VIP seat-ing tickets are $25 online and $30 at the door.

Upcoming Events2 Chainz and Action Bronson perform tonight
Emily Cardinali / Alligator Staff2 Chainz:
Actually named Tauheed Epps (we’ll call him 
Chainz for fun), the Georgia rapper is currently 
signed to Def Jam Recordings and is known best for “Birthday Song” (She got a big booty / so I call her Big Booty) and “I’m Different” (Middle ﬁ  nger up to my competition / I’m different, yeah I’m different). Chainz is sometimes caught wearing more than two chains, but his identity isn’t necessarily tied to his stage name — formerly Tity Boi, the rapper changed his name in 2012 as he rose to fame to become more “family friendly.” Even though Chainz is probably at his best when he collaborates with other artists on songs, we have high expectations for tonight.Action Bronson: 
The lesser-known, yet arguably just as good rap-
per Action Bronson, actually named Arian Asllani, hails from Queens, New York, and is currently signed to Vice Records (an imprint of Atlantic Records), Bronson is extremely well known for his mixtapes, and his involvement in Vice miniseries MUNCHIES as the host of “F***, That’s Delicious.” Before he took the stage as a rapper, he was a chef in NYC, which is why food is often weaved into his raps. (One example is in “The Rockers”: The scent of dollars like some crispy garlic golden brown.) Currently he is working on full-length albums and with artists like Riff Raff on collabs.

Eva Longoria and Forest Whi-
taker are passionate about farm-
workers’ rights, and that passion is coming to Gainesville.
The Hippodrome State Theatre 
will premiere a one-time screen-ing of the documentary “Food Chains” days before its national release. The documentary was ex-ecutively produced by Longoria and is narrated by Whitaker.
Gainesville’s Interfaith Alliance 
for Immigrant Justice, Chispas UF and the Samuel Proctor Oral His-
tory Program will come together 
to host the screening Tuesday at 7 p.m. Tickets cost $10.
“It’s a story really about hope 
and triumph,” said Smriti Keshari, the producer of the documentary. “(It shows) that if everyone works together, we can create a system that’s just and fair and not one that 
relies on exploitation so that one 
party can succeed.”“Food Chains” is part of the 
Hippodrome’s current documen-tary series, Cinema Lounge, and also falls into the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) week.
Chispas UF created CIW week 
to raise awareness for the farm-
workers’ rights in the tomato in-
dustry from Immokalee, Florida, said Crismerly Santibanez, a 21-year-old executive board member of the organization.
“Food Chains” shows the true 
stories of farmworkers who work to defeat the $4 trillion supermar-ket industry, said Sheila Payne, a 
member of Gainesville’s Interfaith 
Alliance for Immigrant Justice. It exposes the abuse they go through in order to get food in supermar-kets. She said the movie focuses on CIW, which has been the state’s most successful food-grower group.
“Eva (Longoria) said it very 
simply,” Keshari said. “‘People should care because we all eat.’”
Because Gainesville and Alach-ua County have been the homes of many protests to bring attention to labor issues, the director of the film, Sanjay Rawal, called Sheila Payne and asked if she would like the movie to premiere in Gainesville. Payne said she was thrilled.
Payne has worked for years in 
Gainesville, protesting major cor-porations like Publix for the accep-tance of the Fair Food label. She has held hunger strikes at Publix headquarters, but in the past five years of protesting, the company has refused to meet with workers.
Alisha Kinman, the Hippo-
drome’s cinema director, said “Food Chains,” like other mov-ies in the theater’s documentary series, will stir conversations. She said after students’ heartstrings are pulled by the movie, there will be a discussion with two members from CIW, who will answer ques-tions.
“Come with an open mind 
(and be) prepared to learn a lot,” Kinman said.

In a time when many of us are turning 
to online recipes for instruction, how is it 
that heavy, richly illustrated cookbooks (unwieldy for practical use in the kitchen) are being released in a steady stream? Are 
cookbooks becoming more of an art piece 
than an instructional book? Are they rest-ing on the coffee table more than on the kitchen counter?
Pictures and illustrations in cookbooks 
provide both an aesthetic and functional element in the narrative. Visuals of dishes and table settings reveal the context of the recipe, indicating how and with what to 
prepare and serve the dish.
Studying the history of French cook-
books, historians Philip and Mary Hyman 
find that as dessert courses became more spectacular during the 17th century, il-lustrations in cookbooks likewise became more elaborate. “Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les liqueurs, et les fruits,” a 1692 cookbook on preserves, was 
the first recipe book to include illustrations of fully set tables. Images serve to visually 
articulate the function of text, displaying a step-by-step cooking process, supplement-ing or replacing text. Images of the finished dish provide visual and evaluative aids to the recipe reader, who is able to determine in a glance the projected goal of the text. 
Visuals also help to extend the practical 
level of cookbooks to the sensual level of 
food. Food studies and cross-disciplinary 
journals, such as Gastronomica, combine creative reflections on the aesthetic quali-ties of food with discussions on the po-litical, economic and social dimensions of food production and consumption.
Similarly, cookbooks offer vicarious 
pleasure with imagined food consump-tion for the reader who virtually tastes and 
smells the food described in the recipes. 
The reader is also willing to defer eating what is prepared, invoking the concept of gastroporn or food porn, the imaginary or unattainable gratification of food. Cook-books offer an escape and fantasy for read-ers with vivid images, while also ground-ing the recipe in reality with actual photos of the dish.Cookbooks as works of art

While Gainesville residents regu-
larly follow Gator football and bas-
ketball, a new fanbase tracks a UF student as he rises in the ranks of competitive gaming.
Juan Debiedma professionally 
plays Super Smash Bros. Melee and the new Super Smash Bros. for Nin-tendo 3DS under the pseudonym Hungrybox.  The UF chemical engi-neering senior leads national rank-ings in the games. 
Super Smash Bros. is a Nintendo 
game that pits the company’s classic 
characters against one another for an 
intense fighting game, and Debiedma leads the pack by playing the Poke-mon franchise’s cute and cuddly Jigglypuff — a round, pink creature with pointed ears and big, blue eyes.
“I just played (Super Smash Bros.) 
with my friends back in 5th and 6th grade, and we were really competi-
tive,” the 21-year-old said. “I’ve been 
playing the game for about seven or eight years now.”
Since his modest beginnings, De-
biedma has performed well in sev-eral notable tournaments across the country. 
“I realized I made it when I got 
third place at the Genesis (Tourna-
ment) in 2009,” he said. “It was my 
first time making money at an event that big, ever.”
He went on to win third place at 
EVO 2013 and second at EVO 2014, essentially the Super Bowl of fighting video games. This summer, Ninten-do of America invited Debiedma to participate in the Super Smash Bros. 
invitational at the Electronic Enter-
tainment Expo in California. While playing the unreleased Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, he finished second place after a gripping sudden death match.
“I use my accomplishments in 
Smash on my resume to show my leadership and ability to organize 
large scale events and network well,” 
he said.
When not practicing, he balances his often hefty schoolwork with his social life. 
“Balancing is very difficult. If I 
want to do well at a tournament, it usually means sacrificing a good exam grade, and vice versa,” he said. 
Debiedma makes great strides in 
developing the Super Smash Bros. community around Gainesville. Last weekend, he attracted 200 players to a statewide tournament at Kanapaha Presbyterian Church. As a member of UF’s Gator Gaming, he helps or-ganize the GatorLAN events every semester as well.
“I try to host events on a semi-reg-
ular basis,” he said, “and I think the local players can definitely use that as an outlet to get better.”
In the near future, Debiedma 
hopes to get a job in chemical engi-neering. However, he plans to play Super Smash Bros. for as long as he can. 
“I’ll compete in (Super Smash 
Bros.) for as long as I am physically able to and as long as it doesn’t inter-fere with other major things in life.”

Sexy clowns will take the stage downtown 
this weekend in an old-timey musical circus 
extravaganza full of acrobatics, stilt walkers, 
flame throwing, tap dancing, singing, storytell-
ing and laughter.
Dr. Sinn’s Freak Island Musical Sideshow’s 
encore performance of its first full-length debut 
is Saturday at 7 p.m. at The Library at Market 
Street. The show contains adult humor. Tickets are $8 in advance and $10 at the door.
“We’re nice clowns,” said Katie Crozier-
Theis, the group’s director. “We want them to 
come in and be OK — to have their funny bone 
tickled.”
One of the group’s goals is to help people 
get over their fear of clowns, said Crozier-Theis, who also plays Sally B. Dash. It’s all 
part of the clown revival movement. Dr. Sinn’s 
Freak Island Musical Sideshow is not about be-ing creepy — there’s no white face paint.
The two-hour act stars four performers from 
the Gainesville burlesque community — Dr. 
Becky Sinn, Sally B. Dash, Della Darling and 
Jenny Castle — with seven other performers throughout the show.
During the first performance Saturday, 
Sinn’s first act was full of stunts, gags and adult humor. Starting with bad magic tricks, the show escalates to a strip tease with Castle while she fire-twirls to Sinn playing a song about sexual conquest. As the show goes on, the acts become more movement oriented. The cast members shake to Sinn’s songs and throw in puns whenever possible.
“It’s the sexiest damn 
clown show there ever was,” said Rebecca Hudson, who plays Sinn.
Although the first act is mostly big shock-
and-awe skits, the second act is more dance-ori-ented. The group shows off its ballet, tap, belly dancing and pantomiming skills and tells sto-ries about puppetry, fortune telling and paro-
dies of popular horror movies and shows. Sinn 
lyrically narrates the skits with musical accom-paniment on guitar, fiddle and accordion.
Dr. Sinn’s Freak Island formed 10 months 
ago when Hudson met Jill Dumas, who plays 
Castle, at a birthday party and they were asked 
to play a few songs, Hudson said. With a few quirky props and some original tunes, the Freak Island was created.
Hudson sings and has been playing guitar 
for 20 years. She wrote 75 percent of the mu-sic for the show, and was mostly inspired by music from the ‘20s, ‘30s and the cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls. She wanted the name of her 
group to reflect her music and sound like an 
old-time sideshow. 
“This is a dream come true for me,” Hudson 
said. 
By the second time they performed, Dumas 
asked Crozier-Theis to join the band. Dumas said she is very selective about whom she asks to join their group. Everyone involved is cut from the same cloth and works very well to-
gether.
“The universe draws these people to me,” 
she said. “It’s fate.” 10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2014

When I saw The Savants of Soul live 
back in June, it was clear to me that 
they were determined to bring the feel 
of 1950s and ‘60s soul music to 2014 and 
beyond. Whether the band has three members, 12 members, or its current 10, it’s likely only a matter of time before its blaring 
horns, raspy vocals and catchy instrumentals 
reach your ears and make you get up and groove. 
Over the last two years, the band, made 
up of mostly Gainesville natives, has been 
playing shows around the Gainesville area, 
building a fanbase without even introducing a tangible album.
Lead singer Justin McKenzie joked that 
the crowd usually knows the words to the band’s song “You’re All Mine” better than he does.
Much like the past two years, The Savants 
of Soul will be playing a show at The Atlan-
tic, 15 N. Main St., Friday at 9 p.m. This time, 
it will be in celebration of the release of their first album, “Downtown Sound.” The goal of the album, said 
drummer Alex Klausner, was to get the experience of the live show “on a piece of wax” or vinyl so the album could be physically avail-able. People can buy the album on 
iTunes and stream it on Spotify.
“The reality is people aren’t go-
ing to buy CDs anymore,” said bass guitarist 
John Gray Shermyen. 
Klausner added his new laptop doesn’t 
even have a slot for CDs. “Considering our image as a throwback band, why not have that throwback format, especially when it’s growing?” said Klausner, who also said the 
future of music lies in streaming.
The album was available on Grooveshark, 
a music-streaming company developed and 
based in Gainesville, a week before its Tues-
day release, which Gray Shermyen said gave 
the band “the opportunity for much wider exposure.” 
When you start playing the album, it’s 
as if you’ve been transported to the outdoor 
stage at The JAM. 
Tickets for the show are $5, and trust me,

Whoever holds the conch, speaks.
The setting was intimate but there 
was no shortage of guests. People sat 
in booths with friends, ordered deli-cious pizzas and waited until they drank enough to gain the courage to 
get on stage.
Tuesday night, people went out 
to Lightnin’ Salvage behind Satchel’s 
Pizza to participate in Grow Ra-dio’s monthly storytelling event, The 
Conch. This month, the topic was pets 
and companions. 
The stories consisted of unusual 
first pets such as mice, a UF student’s 
cat that took over her room while she 
was away at college, a young man who 
asked for dating advice from a fish and 
a young woman who had taken care of a bunch of stray cats.
 There was even one woman who 
brought her white Pomeranian, Bob-
by, as inspiration for the crowd. 
Arugably the most interesting story 
of the night belonged to Janice Dees, 
who spoke about living with her sister and her sister’s boyfriend in a haunted house. 
 The ghost of an old woman sup-
posedly haunted the house, and not long after living there, Dees experi-enced paranormal activity firsthand. 
One day, Dees returned to an emp-
ty home, and her sister’s dog, Stinks, was in the backyard.
Dees knew that she had left Stinks 
inside when she left. She checked with 
her sister. Neither she nor her boy-
friend had been home since Dees had 
left, and she had shut the doors before she left for the day. 
She chalked it up to the old woman 
ghost.  
The 26-year-old admitted to be-
ing a regular at the event but said she doesn’t rehearse her stories before hand.
“Oral history builds community 
bonds, and it’s a way to pass stories through the generations,” Dees said.
She said she believes it is important 
in maintaining the human connection. 
Telling stories, she says, “It’s in our 
genes.”Pet stories at The ConchBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

theme for the Gators in their last 15 matches as they have strung together their longest win streak 
in four years.
On Wednesday night, No. 7 
Florida (20-3, 14-0 Southeast-ern Conference) earned its 15th straight victory and seventh con-
secutive sweep when it ousted 
Auburn (11-15, 3-10 SEC) 3-0 (25-
14, 25-21, 25-10).
Florida’s .522 team hitting clip 
set a season high and marked the first time UF hit over .500 since 
last season’s win against Ala-
bama on Oct. 6, 2013.
Junior Ziva Recek was a large 
part of the win, contributing nine kills off the bench and recording 
a career-high .643 hitting percent-
age, the highest since her fresh-
man year.
“You have to work hard dur-
ing practice. You can’t wait for 
someone to start playing bad,” 
Recek said. “You have to keep 
improving. And that’s what I’m 
doing.”
Sophomore Alex Holston fin-
ished with a match high 11 kills, two digs, two total blocks and 
one service ace.
“I think it was an all around 
team effort,” Holston said. “It 
was great that all our hitters were 
having an on night because that 
just left (open) seams and one-
on-one (opportunities).”
Florida jumped out to an early 
12-6 lead in the first set before taking a 1-0 lead against Auburn.
The Tigers turned the momen-
tum in the second, tallying an ear-ly 3-2 lead and taking advantage 
as Florida began to slack off. 
“At that point we were being 
outplayed,” coach Mary Wise said. “We didn’t have a block registered in that set. Auburn was making more digs. We just 
were a little passive.”
The two con-
ference foes swapped points 
until UF took a 
14-13 lead mid-
way through the 
second set. 
From there, 
Florida held 
the lead for the remainder of the 
match.
With the shutout, Florida ex-
tended its consecutive set win-
ning streak to 24, dating back to 
Oct. 15 against South Carolina.
Next, Florida will travel to 
Lexington, Kentucky, to face No. 15 Kentucky. 
The Wildcats are riding a 
four-match winning streak and 
present the biggest challenge the 
Gators will face in conference play this year. 
“We’re looking at it as it’s a 
match unto itself. It doesn’t mat-
ter what happened before, what 
happens after. It’s an opportu-nity to play a great team on their 
home court,” Wise sad. “... (we) 
know all eyes in the country will 
be on this match. We’re embrac-
ing the opportunity.”14, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2014

 Looking back at his team’s exhibition 
game, Florida basketball coach Billy Don-
ovan pinpointed more than a few weak-
nesses. 
One of those weakness was freshman 
forward Devin Robinson’s performance.
“The reason I was upset is I had a con-
versation with Devin before the exhibition game because I think what happens to a lot of freshmen is when they go in their ﬁ  rst game there’s nerves, there’s anxiousness, they’re uptight in their ﬁ  rst college game. Rightfully so, they all go through it,” Don-
ovan said. 
“I tried to help him and help him un-
derstand when you do that you take your 
focus and your mind off what your job is and what’s going on. And I felt like when 
Devin got in the game it was just all about 
scoring.”

Gators looking to improve
T                         he Gators are on a roll 
as the season begins to die down. Florida (5-3, 
4-3 Southeastern Conference) is riding a two-game win streak against SEC East opponents Georgia and Vanderbilt. With UF heading into its SEC ﬁ  na-le — a noon matchup against South Carolina (4-5, 2-5 SEC) — here are ﬁ  ve matchups to watch.
1.) Dylan Thompson vs. the Florida 
secondary: The Gators defense has im-proved its game against the pass since its 42-21 loss to the Crimson Tide on Sept. 20. In the ﬁ  ve games since surrendering 449 passing yards against Alabama, Florida’s opponents are averaging just 175.8 yards through the air. That could change Sat-urday when UF faces a South Carolina offense helmed by quarterback Dylan Thompson. The redshirt senior is second in the SEC in yards per game (287.6) and has thrown 22 touchdowns compared to just 10 interceptions. His highlight game came in South Carolina’s 42-35 loss to Auburn on Oct. 25, when he tied the Game-cocks’ single-game record with ﬁ  ve passing touch-downs. If Thompson gets hot early, it will be a long day for Florida.
2.) Matt Jones and Kelvin 
Taylor vs. the South Caro-
lina defense: To put it simply, the Game-cocks are terrible at defending the run, giving up an SEC worst 223.4 yards and 2.7 touchdowns per game on the ground. This could mean a ﬁ  eld day for Florida’s one-two punch in Matt Jones and Kelvin Taylor, who have accumulated 526 yards and ﬁ  ve rushing touchdowns during UF’s two-game win streak. 
3.) Development of Treon: The story 
of Treon Harris’ role in Florida’s offense is still evolving. In his ﬁ  rst start against Georgia, calling him a game manager

From the suburbs of Lakewood Ranch, 
Florida, to the densely populated New York City, the young Gators ended their fall season Sunday competing at Florida’s highest level in recent years.
In Flushing, New York, freshman No. 
2-seed Josie Kuhlman won the consola-tion singles title and No. 4-seed Brooke Austin reached the singles semiﬁ  nals in the USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercol-legiate Championships.
After dropping her 
ﬁ  rst round in singles, Kuhlman progressed through consolations 
and defeated University of California Berkeley’s No. 16 Zsoﬁ   Susanyi in three sets (4-6, 7-5, 6-2) to win the consolations title.
“Josie’s added more offensive to her 
game, and her win (Sunday) certainly il-lustrates that,” coach Roland Thornqvist said.
The 5-foot-6 right-hander also won the 
singles title in the USTA/ITA Southeast Regional Championships, Oct. 20., which got her in the ITA’s fall national tourna-ment.
“I don’t need to say much to Josie re-ally,” Thornqvist said. 
“She runs it herself. I’ll walk onto the 
court during her matches and just give her a point or two.”
As for Austin, who dropped to the Uni-
versity of Virginia’s No. 6-seed Julia Elba-ba (6-2, 6-4), her season included a singles title at the Duke Fab Four Invitational, Sept. 14.
“Certainly hit the jackpot when we got 
them,” Thornqvist said.
Though he said the team isn’t relying 
on their leadership from the freshmen’s successes, just their points.
At the 2014 Lakewood Ranch Dick Vi-
tale Intercollegiate Clay Court Classic, tandem Spencer Liang and Stefani Stojic won the doubles title after beat Oklahoma State University’s Katerina Adomovic and Vladica Babic, 8-1.
No. 1-seed Belinda Woolcock reached 
the singles ﬁ  nals but fell short to Ado-movic who took home the singles title, 6-4, Women’s tennis successful in NYAIR JORDAN

His lone responsibility was feeding the ball 
to his running back and not botching a snap. 
But fast forward just one week to the Vander-bilt game, and Harris found himself in a tradi-tional quarterback role, attempting 21 passes and accruing 215 yards in the process. 
He showcased his ability to throw the ball 
deep, completing passes of 60 and 48 yards to Quinton Dunbar and Ahmad Fulwood, respec-tively. When the Gators return to the Swamp on Saturday, fans will see which role Harris will assume in Florida’s offense.
4.) Battle in the trenches: As of late, the 
Gators have excelled on both sides of scrim-mage, ranking sixth in the SEC in sacks (2.5) and ﬁ  fth in sacks allowed per game (1.5). In its last three games, UF has forced four sacks and 
16 quarterback hurries. The Gamecocks, on the 
other hand, are 14th and 11th in the same cat-
egories, respectively. Florida’s pass rush — led by Dante Fowler Jr., Bryan Cox and Jon Bullard — will look to continue its successful run that 
has arisen as of late.
5.) Turnovers: After Florida’s abysmal 42-13 
loss to Missouri, the Gators’ saw their season 
turnover margin drop from +5 to even. But 
since Harris was handed the offense during the 
bye week that followed, Florida has started to 
right the ship. The Gators are now tied for sixth in the SEC and tied for 37th in the nation with a +4 turnover margin. The Gamecocks, on the other hand, are -4 in the turnover battle, which puts them 12th in the conference and tied for 97th nationally.

Donovan disappointed in Robinson’s performance against Barry
6-0.
“Over the course of the fall, we 
actually had a better fall than I prob-
ably anticipated with half the team 
new,” the 14th-year coach said.
Last year, the team had two se-
niors compete in the ITA nationals 
fall tournament, who both dropped in the ﬁ  rst round of singles action and followed up with quick exits from singles consolations. 
Last weekend, ﬁ  ve Gators attend-
ed the tournament and two competed through several rounds.
Thornqvist said the team looks physically outstanding right now.
The players reduced practice time 
Monday, following the eight-hour rule, which will continue till break.
Thornqvist said the players will 
have to do some training indepen-dently to prepare for the regular sea-
son.
The Gators will begin their spring 
season in January at the ITA Kickoff 
Weekend in at the Ring Tennis Com-plex.
“With a young team that we have, 
I think it’s very important for us to be physically well-prepared for a gruel-ing regular season in the spring,” he said.two of 10 ﬁ  eld-goal attempts and just one of six three-point at-tempts.
The 6-foot-8 forward and ﬁ  ve-
star recruit out of Christchurch, Virginia, totaled three rebounds in 17 minutes played. 
Robinson didn’t make a shot 
until the ﬁ  nal six minutes of the game when he sank a three-
pointer of a pass dished to him by 
point guard Kasey Hill.
“I felt like in the game and 
during the game and even after the game, I thought the things I tried to talk to Devin about, it’s 
not like he didn’t really heed my 
word,” Donovan said.
Donovan said Robinson came 
to him in the locker room after 
the game to discuss his commit-
ment to improving.
“I’ve always said this: There’s 
certain players you tell them it’s 
hot, don’t touch and they don’t 
touch it,” Donovan said. 
“There’s other guys you say 
hey it’s hot, don’t touch it and 
they want to touch it. And they ﬁ  nd out what hot is and they 
learn that way. And I think Devin 
in that situation wanted to touch the stove.”
Junior guard Michael Frazier 
II spoke with Robinson after the 
game about his performance. 
Frazier said he told Robinson 
to settle down mentally.
“I think he put a lot of pres-
sure on himself going into the game and he did some uncharac-teristic things,” Frazier said. “But 
he’s gotten better since we’ve 
been practicing so that’s very 
promising.
“We’re encouraged as a team 
to see him grow every day as well 
as (Chris) Chiozza. But it starts 
with the leaders, the older guys leading by example and show em how it’s supposed to be done.”
Robinson wasn’t the only 
player who struggled defensively 
on Thursday. 
Frazier said he noticed his 
own defense was lacking after he reviewed ﬁ  lm from Barry.
“I think as a team we just got 
to focus on the defensive ﬂ  oor 
more, you know,” Frazier said.
“We got a lot of scoring, we got 
a lot of talent, we’re going points 
but I think, myself included, we have to focus more on the defense 
end and communication.”
Frazier snagged ﬁ  ve total re-bounds in 28 minutes played 
against Barry.
Moving forward to the Gators’ 
ﬁ  rst non-exhibition matchup 
of the season, Donovan said 
the team’s communication and 
leadership has evolved from the 
struggles of the ﬁ  rst weeks of practice. 
He said the players are exhib-
iting more awareness and under-
standing.
“I think it’s still a work in prog-
ress,” Donovan said. “I think it’s 
better today than it was last week 
and hopefully as the year goes on 
we’ll continue to get better.”
