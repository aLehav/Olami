Carlos Aguilar was in Gainesville 
this time last year, too.
Aguilar took his son Christian to 
UF Preview. Both were excited for 
the future — Christian would start in Summer B. Someone even snapped a picture of the grinning new Gator, wearing a nametag and clutching a Preview tote bag.
On Tuesday, Carlos Aguilar wore a 
white shirt bearing that picture as he sat in the Alachua County Courthouse in a case management hearing for Pe-dro Bravo, the 19-year-old accused of killing his son.
Michael Ruppert, the third lawyer 
Bravo has had since the case began about 10 months ago, told Judge Peter Sieg he needed time to take the deposi-tions of 110 witnesses.
Sieg decided the court would recon-
vene Aug. 27 despite State Attorney Brian Kramer’s objection to a delay.
Aguilar said he was pleased with 
Kramer’s attempt to move things along.
“I want to make sure that the mes-
sage is clear — sent to the judge that we want this set for trial,” Aguilar said. “And that we’re ready. And that we know that he is guilty of the crime that he committed.”
According to court records, Bravo is charged with kidnapping, homicide, lying to police, providing false reports, mishandling human remains, tamper-ing with physical evidence, and poi-soning food and/or water with the intent to kill or injure a person.

The Alachua County Commission voted in a meeting 
Tuesday to approve a special exception that would allow 
solar panels on a parcel of land in Paynes Prairie.
The plan for the land, named Prairie View Solar Park, 
is to construct a 1.5-megawatt ground-mounted solar panel system that would feed directly into the existing Gainesville Regional Utilities grid.
The proposal sets aside about 9 acres located in the 2300 
block of Southwest 63rd Avenue. However, the company constructing the panels, Sybac Solar, plans to use only about a 5-acre fenced area.
While the motion was recommended for approval at a 
previous meeting, it faced opposition by commissioners and the community.
Residents previously expressed concerns including 
noise and negative visual effects related to the project. 
In response to the concerns, the commission proposed 
buffer zones at the north and east boundaries of the plot. 
Susan Baird, a county commissioner, who cast the only 
dissenting vote, said she appreciated the steps being taken to protect the land and ease complaints, but she said she wouldn’t vote in favor of the motion because other loca-tions are available for the project.
“Aren’t there enough rooftops where we could ﬁ  nd a 
place for the panels?” she said. “It seems like we are leav-ing a large footprint on a beautiful piece of land when there are other places already established.”

Thinking of getting a Ph.D. in economics? Not so fast. 
UF’s Ph.D. program in economics is not accepting ap-
plicants for the upcoming school year. 
Roger Blair, the department of economics chairman, said 
funds to accommodate new students will not be provided, but Ph.D. students currently enrolled in the program are not being cut off.  
“The program hasn’t been canceled, but in a sort of de facto way it has — because without fund-ing, you can’t have a Ph.D. program,” Blair said. “When it came time to allocate funds for supporting the Ph.D. students, we were told that no funds would be al-located.”
UF Warrington College of Business 
Administration Dean John Kraft wrote in an email that the department was offered 
the opportunity to move to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences but opted to remain within the business college and become smaller. 
“In the future, they will be able to offer a business eco-
nomics major and graduate courses as needed,” he said in the email. “This strategy is consistent with the college’s strategy of downsizing to better service the development needs of students, faculty and staff.”
There are 27 students in the Ph.D. program, according to 
the department’s website. Having senior faculty members teach such small classes can get expensive, Blair said, but losing the program will impact the entire business college.UF Ph.D. economics program denied funding, forced to downsize

Group wants to knit cover for Pa. 
Warhol bridge 
PITTSBURGH — Andy War-
hol’s art doesn’t often conjure 
warm and fuzzy images — but a proposed tribute to him just might.
An arts group wants to cover 
a downtown Pittsburgh bridge named for Warhol with knitted blankets.
Allegheny County Council 
must sign off on the plan. But if it goes forward, the Fiberarts Guild of Pittsburgh will use machine-knitted blankets to cover the bridge’s towering superstructure while individual blankets knitted by more than 1,200 volunteers will be used to cover its walk-ways.
The Pittsburgh Tribune-Re-
view hopes to cover the bridge in mid-August and leave the blan-kets in place for about a month.
After the blankets are re-
moved, they’ll be washed and distributed to homeless shelters, nursing homes and animal shel-ters.

da Gross says, “The point is to knit stronger communities.”

felt that the panels should be placed 
elsewhere.  
“I am fully supportive of solar en-
ergy,” Humphrey said. “But it’s not institutional or public utility. It’s the wrong place and the wrong time.”
All parties involved in the project, 
including Gary Dounson & Associ-ates, Prairie View Trust, Friends of Paynes Prairie, GRU and Sybac So-lar, confirmed that the project is only temporary.
The proposed plan would allow 
solar panels on the land for 20 years. 
After that, the panels would be 
removed, and the land would be do-nated to the organization Friends of Paynes Prairie.
Star Tarrant, the current president 
of Friends of Paynes Prairie, said she supports the project. 
During a public comment seg-
ment, she said that after moving to Gainesville in 1997 from a metropoli-tan area, she began to love how green the city was, and she said project will help maintain the atmosphere.
“I love the prairie and support the long-term conservation of it,” Tarrant said, noting the land would likely be used for residential housing other-wise. JULIA GLUM

UF students won’t be voting in Student Government 
elections from their smartphones or off-campus apart-
ments anytime soon.
The Student Senate rejected a bill Tuesday night that 
would have allowed secure site online voting. Senators Nic Knowlton, Helie Dharia and Warren Rhea led the discussion in favor of the bill, referencing projected in-creases in voter turnout and its presence at other schools. Senators Dylan Fisher, Austin Sherman and Joseph Mi-chaels headed the argument against it, citing concerns about the integrity of votes and a failed national attempt to implement a similar system.
The Senate also passed the first reading of the 
amended fiscal year 2013-2014 activity and service fee budget, which totals $18,992,300.
Among the changes is a reduction of about $23,000 
for the readership program, which had previously pro-vided paper copies of The New York Times and USA Today on campus.
Michaels, also the budget and appropriations chair-
man, said the new amount of $27,173 will allow for digi-tal subscriptions.
“If a student were to go to one of the newspaper 
stands early in the morning, more than likely there would not be a newspaper for them to grab,” he said. “People who were there earlier get to them first — so, professors, community members. There is no way to dictate who gets these newspapers.”
Michaels said because students pay the activity and 
service fees, they should be the ones benefiting from the program.
The amended budget also allocated $5,000 more to 
elections to increase “poll worker efficiency,” Michaels said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 13, 2013

He said graduate students provide tutoring for under-
graduate business students, and without it, the quality of 
the undergraduate courses could suffer. 
Ph.D. students also teach economics electives. This 
school year, there will be nine sections entirely staffed by them.
“If I didn’t have those Ph.D. students, those courses 
couldn’t be offered because everybody is already as-signed,” Blair said.
Economics professor Larry Kenny said the depart-
ment’s faculty is dwindling.
“When I was chairman for six years back in the 90s, 
at that time we were averaging 31 or 32 faculty,” he said. “We’re at 11, and we’re slated to go to half that.”
Kenny said the absence of a Ph.D. program might re-duce the faculty even further.
“There are a large number of faculty who basically en-
joy working with Ph.D. students and would not be inter-ested in working with just undergraduates,” Kenny said.
Blair said that of the 62 members of the Association of 
American Universities, the only ones without Ph.D. pro-grams in economics are Case Western Reserve University, Emory University and now UF.
“Even FSU has a Ph.D. program in economics,” he 
said. “We’d like to think UF is the flagship university. We should be in there.”PHD , from page 1

A construction worker lays bricks while working on a new parking garage Wednesday after -
noon behind Roberts’ Stadium Club on University Avenue. It should be completed in August.
ALANNA MASSEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
The eight-story, 104-foot Roberts’ Sta-
dium Club complex near Midtown will 
begin filling up.
It is now leasing commercial units and 
will open residential leasing soon.
Capital City Bank has already signed 
a lease with the building and will be go-ing in shortly, said John Thomas, senior vice president realtor for Thomas Group Realty.
Thomas said four other businesses are 
negotiating with the Stadium Club. Al-though he couldn’t release the names yet, he said three are nationally known busi-nesses, and the fourth is a local business looking to relocate.
When completed, the building, at 1802 
W. University Ave., will offer commercial space on the first four floors and residen-tial units in the top half.
“It’s a high profile location, so it’s ex-
pensive,” he said, “but in relation to other things on the avenue, it’s priced in line.”
Henri Girl Boutique, which already 
moved into the ground floor of the Stadi-um Club complex, relocated from a plaza on Archer Road in March.
Alix Kissinger, assistant manager of 
Henri Girl Boutique, said the new location better suits the business’ needs.
“It’s summer right now, so it’s kind of 
slow,” she said, “but I feel like it’s a really good location being so close to campus.”
Some customers have commented on a 
lack of parking spaces for the complex.
Mary Labance, a 20-year-old microbiol-
ogy and cell science senior, said she walks to How Do You Roll?, the sushi restaurant on the first floor of the building, because parking is limited.
“It’s right across the street from cam-
pus, so it was convenient,” she said.
But the six-story parking garage, still 
in the construction phase, behind Sta-dium Club should help, Thomas said. It will hold 88 cars and should be finished in August.Stadium Club opens leasing ahead of August completion

Veteran pianists will join high school 
and college students Sunday for a week 
devoted to their instruments of choice.
The UF International Piano Festival, 
which runs until June 23, will allow 30 stu-dents to hone and showcase their talents with renowned pianists. 
Participants had to undergo an applica-
tion process to join.
The festival will include daily master 
classes and recitals for public viewing in Room 101 of the Music Building as well as two recitals at UF Health Shands Hospital, said UF piano professor Kevin Orr, found-ing director of the festival.
“This event brings a lot of high-level 
music-making and culture to the Uni-versity of Florida and Gainesville community in the summer,” Orr said.  
This year’s festival fac-
ulty includes instructors from Juilliard School of 
Music in New York and China’s Sichuan Conser-vatory of Music.
The festival was first held in 2007 as the 
Chinese-American International Piano In-stitute in Chengdu, China, before taking on its current form at UF in 2010, Orr said.
UF benefits from being one of about 
150 schools worldwide to exclusively use Steinway pianos, said Jessica Hurov, pub-lic relations and marketing manager for the College of Fine Arts.
“That means our students and faculty 
get to play on the very best pianos, and the people who come get to hear the very best,” Hurov said.Students to tickle the ivories next week at piano festival on campus“It’s a high profile location, so

My family was channel surﬁ  ng the other day 
when we came across a program. I don’t know what the program was about or what context I 
was viewing it under, but one part stuck out before the channel changed. 
For the two minutes or so that I was watching, the 
show detailed how a U.S. military unit attacked a group of people from what I think was a helicopter of some sort. I think what had been shown just before I looked up was that the unit had rained a hellacious volley of bullets upon these people, who were either insurgents or possibly some terrorist group. I don’t know for sure. Regardless, after their ﬁ  rst shots, the pilots audibly pleaded for these people to pick up a weapon so that they could ﬁ  re more shots at these people.
Suddenly, a makeshift ambulance arrived to pick up 
these wounded victims. The pilots asked for permission to engage the vehicle, which was granted. With glee, the pilots unleashed even more bullets, obscuring the people and ambulance from view as a giant dust cloud rose up.
The show cut to a man talking, who mentioned that 
while watching it, you could feel the pilots were de-tached, like they were playing a video game. I cringed for a second because of that. I was about to be up in arms over the mere idea that video games were being linked, yet again, to violence without good reason.
Then I stopped. I mulled it over. The person said the 
footage of the attack was like a video game — not that games caused it. As I thought about it, I agreed. The footage looked like the view from a helicopter in “Call of Duty,” “Battleﬁ  eld” and any other war games about this time period I may be forgetting.
I should not cringe whenever video games are 
brought up in the mainstream media — which I hope to be a full-ﬂ  edged member of someday soon. There should not be an inherent negative connotation associ-ated with one source of entertainment. When a man is arrested for trying to imitate the latest car movie, we don’t blame the ﬁ  lm industry for making entertaining ﬁ  lms that some people want to imitate. 
Yet for some reason, that’s 
the exact response we see when 
video games are involved in anything that is deemed news-worthy aside from this week’s E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, which I am genuinely ex-
cited about for the ﬁ  rst time in years.
Video games are entertainment and stress releasers 
— nothing more, nothing less. But they generate hits on websites and ratings for news broadcasts. It’s a highly volatile subject, one that is almost guaranteed to pro-voke viewer responses. It even provoked an entire col-umn from me.
The best way for video games to move past this 
stigma of causing violence may sound counterintui-tive. We gamers need to stop rallying around games as some holy and pure source of enjoyment that is above reproach. Our passion to defend games is partly what drives stories about them. Executives know we care, which essentially guarantees an audience.
The largest professional wrestling promotion, World 
Wrestling Entertainment, faced a crisis when one of its top stars, Chris Benoit, murdered his family and then himself in June 2007. 
Despite the negative publicity and outcry that 
stemmed from it, WWE made it out of the situation just ﬁ  ne. They did so by taking a unique approach: Instead of denying that wrestling could have caused it, WWE treated the incident as an isolated event that, while trag-ic, was an anomaly, and the company moved on.
The same approach would assist gamers. Reacting 
as we do now only focuses on the games, not on other possible causes. As such, this will be my last column on this issue.

In case you didn’t already know, there’s some pretty crazy 
stuff happening in Turkey. Since May 31, protests that start-ed with the redevelopment of a park have spread to 78 cities throughout the country. Protesters are concerned that Prime Minister Erdogan, who was once considered progressive, is now promoting an authoritarian and even an Islamist agenda. Since the protests started, thousands have been injured and some have been killed.
Despite its high proportion of Muslims, Turkey is a country 
that has enjoyed secular democracy. For attempting to subvert precious freedoms by means of violence and police brutality, we give Erdogan this week’s ﬁ  rst DART.
Last weekend, Edward Snowden released massive amounts 
of classiﬁ  ed information from the National Security Agency. It was one of the biggest leaks in U.S. history. The leaked mate-rial shows that the NSA has been collecting information from everyone in the U.S. 
While so many on Capitol Hill are defending the NSA’s il-
legal behavior, Sen. Rand Paul seems like the only person who’s actually on the side of the people. This week, Paul announced on Fox News that he would be opposing the NSA by ﬁ  ling a suit against them with the Supreme Court. Maybe Paul feels so strongly about it because it was revealed that Snowden donated to Paul’s father’s presidential campaign. While we don’t agree with Rand Paul on everything, we’ll take our allies where we can ﬁ  nd them, especially when nobody else is stepping up to the plate. We give a LAUREL to Rand Paul for supporting the 
people.
This week, the Transportation Security Administration was 
schooled by a Wookiee. Star Wars actor Peter Mayhew was stopped by the TSA for his suspicious-looking cane, which looked more like a lightsaber. Mayhew, who played Chewbacca in the series, promptly began to live tweet the incident.
“Magic words to TSA are not ‘please’ or ‘thank you’ … It’s 
‘Twitter’…” tweeted Mayhew after ﬁ  nally having his cane re-turned. TSA, he isn’t the one you’re looking for. For wasting valuable time and resources that could be better spent looking for terrorists, we give a DART to TSA.
In a stunning display of ignorance, Glenn Beck has attempted 
yet again to freak out the American public. Beck, known for his dramatic displays and messianic rants, effectively labeled those who disagree with him as idol worshipers on his radio show, saying that “...whether we know it or not, that’s exactly what our society and what our world is doing right now: worshipping Moloch and Ba’al.”
Beck’s radio show has nearly 10 million listeners, and many 
of these listeners are sure to be voters. For living in a world dis-connected from reality and trying to take his listeners with him, Glenn Beck gets a DART. It’s not that we worship Satan — it’s 
just that we think he’s kind of like him.
Finally, we’d like to give a quick LAUREL to whoever decid-
ed that it was time to remove the statue of the creepy dancing couple from our campus. Can you believe that thing was there for two years? If you’re ever feeling down, just remember that you weren’t the one who made the decision to put it there. All you did was pay for it to be put there — and hauled off.

wear black face?” seemed fairly simple and not up for debate as the answer should have been an obvious “absolutely never.” But ap-parently that wasn’t the case after reading the article.
There is something problematic with the 
liberal idea that racist and oppressive acts should go unsanctioned  because of precious civil liberties and individual rights. Wheth-er you’re wearing blackface, leading a neo-Nazi march or any other white supremacist event, the idea that somehow you should be given the space simply because of “freedom of speech” and the “right to assemble” is an asinine one.
Oppressive acts that intentionally target 
oppressed groups on campus shouldn’t be endorsed, and even if the university is con-stitutionally unable to sanction individuals for racist acts, in rhetoric, these acts should be denounced.
By simply saying that freedom of speech 
allows for students to don blackface or ad-vocate for Nazism on Turlington if they choose to show the lack of awareness of the sensitivities of non-white students on cam-pus.
Individuals who safe within the con-
struct of whiteness have the ability to be seen as individuals and aren’t inundated with images throughout their whole life of their race being demonized and satirized for entertainment. 
So it’s not surprising that those removed 
can come from the neutral standpoint that “even if what you’re saying is bigoted I sup-port your right to say it.” My opinion on the matter is that not only will I denounce rac-ist acts but I refuse to be liberal and support your right to denigrate my race. 
And for the writer of the column to say 
that students on campus took the conversa-tion in the wrong direction is laughable.
You can don blackface and use the n-
word when institutionalized racism isn’t still a present  thing affecting black people. Until then, I don’t give a s--- about your freedom of speech, which only seeks to slander me.

UF diversity leader appointed to local cultural affairs board� THE COLLEGE HOSTED A JOB FAIR.

In response to a growing need for teach-
ers to fill classrooms, Santa Fe College host-
ed one of its first job fairs to recruit adjunct professors.
About 70 people attended the first day 
of the fair Tuesday — mostly local profes-sionals and retirees, like Gainesville resident John Gregory.
Gregory, formerly a high school math 
teacher and UF professor, said he’s turning to SFC because he wants to teach again, but the responsibilities of an adjunct professor are a better fit for his retirement lifestyle. 
“I miss it,” Gregory said. “I really do.”SFC Human Resources Director Lela 
Frye said the turnout for the first job fair was overwhelming.
Usually, she said, the recruiting process 
is handled online, but because the college needed a large number of candidates at one time, the college’s administration decided to try a new approach.
Naima Cherie Brown, the interim vice 
president of student affairs and a representa-tive for the student development instruction department, said most adjunct professors already have a job or aim to teach full time in the future. 
“These are professional people looking to 
help the community, engage with some stu-dents and make some cash,” Brown said. 
Roger K. Strickland, an SFC business 
professor, said the need for adjunct faculty is growing because the college has added bachelor’s degree programs, which means more classes that need teachers.
Strickland said because adjunct faculty 
members tend to use the position for supple-mental income, they also tend to move on after a few years.
“We get the benefit of having somebody 
that is really well-educated and a great in-structor for at least a couple of years, but then, they move and we have to replace them,” Strickland said. SFC recruits adjunct professors

Summer brought a new, graphics-based 
version of the UF e-Learning system — and 
with it came plans for the future.
The Office of Academic Technology 
is considering creating a faculty commit-tee next spring to evaluate whether UF should continue to use the current course management system, Sakai, or move to an alternative product, said Assistant Director for Learning  Support Services Douglas F. Johnson.
The committee members will be instruc-
tors from various colleges who primarily rely on online learning systems to teach. 
Sakai was introduced to UF in 2010, and 
the course management system is typically evaluated every five years, Johnson said. The new systems that will be up for consid-eration are Canvas, Sakai Open Academic Environment and Adrenna.
“Somewhere between 70 and 75 percent 
of all courses at the University of Florida use the course management system for some part of their instruction,” he said, so it will be a huge process to move from one course management system to another. 
The final decision will be made by fac-
ulty and not UF Information Technology, he said. 
Dominique Barker, a 19-year-old UF 
psychology junior, said she doesn’t think UF needs another course management sys-tem.
“As technology continues to advance, I 
think Sakai has potential as a platform be-cause it is an open source,” Barker said. “If something were to break, it could be fixed immediately without waiting for a compa-ny to fix the problem.”Committee could evaluate 
newly made-over Sakai

looking to help the community, 
engage with some students and 
make some cash.”

Jarrod Cruz-Stipsits loved col-
lege so much he said he never want-
ed to leave. And he hasn’t.
The 36-year-old Gainesville resi-
dent who has studied and worked in academia for years will now fill another role advocating for cultural arts citywide.
On Monday, Cruz-Stipsits was 
appointed to the Gainesville-Alach-ua County Cultural Affairs Board. He will begin his new responsibili-ties Aug. 28. 
The board, composed of volun-
teers, advises the city and county commissions on policies and airs concerns relating to cultural activi-ties.
Cruz-Stipsits currently works as 
the director of intercultural engage-ment UF Multicultural & Diversity Affairs.
Interest in the arts, however, 
isn’t new for Cruz-Stipsits. 
During his undergraduate years 
at University of Tennessee, he stud-ied music education and composi-tion. He is also a professional trum-pet player in a Latin band based in northwest Florida called “La Or-questa Tropical.”
“Anything arts-related, I’ve 
always had a passion about,” he said.
Cruz-Stipsits recalled feeling 
“thrilled” when he learned his ap-plication for the position had been chosen, especially because the job involves attending arts and cultural events, which he said he does in his spare time anyway.
Cruz-Stipsits said he aims to en-
gage students in the cultural arts programs.
“I am most excited about mak-
ing connections with the people — the City of Gainesville — getting to know more intimately the cultural arts community and how we can help enhance and move it forward,” he said.
Russell Etling, the city’s cultural 
affairs programs coordinator, said Cruz-Stipsits will bring an under-standing of the diversity and needs of the whole community to the board.
“His enthusiasm and apprecia-
tion of all things cultural are a great asset,” he said. THURSDAY, JUNE 13, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

A Gainesville man was 
rushed to UF Health Shands 
Hospital on Wednesday after Gainesville Police officers re-sponded to a report of a gun-shot at a hotel.
Officers found Enece 
Guerrier, a 36-year-old Orlando resident, bleed-ing heavily from a gunshot wound in the lobby of Sleep Inn & Suites, 4110 SW 40th Blvd., according to an email from GPD spokesman Offi-cer Ben Tobias.
Guerrier accidentally 
shot himself in the leg with his .45-caliber pistol when he tried to take it out of his holster in his hotel room, ac-cording to the email. He then walked to the lobby to ask someone to call 911.
Guerrier was rushed to 
the hospital and immediately taken into surgery, according to the email.
Both halves of a 
Gainesville couple were ar-rested for battery Tuesday in a fight about $5.
Kenneth Hill, 20, argued 
with his wife, 20-year-old Ahriana Hill, when she said she was going to leave the house to spend $5 on food, according to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office arrest report.
When Ahriana, who is five 
months pregnant, began to back out of the driveway, her husband opened the car door and reached for her purse, according to the report. After the purse broke, Ahriana Hill drove toward Kenneth Hill and got out of the car.
According to the report, 
Kenneth Hill then squeezed her neck for about five sec-onds, pushed her to the ground and pinned her against the car. Ahriana Hill scratched him in the face.
They were both booked in 
the Alachua County Jail and later released.
Two 14-year-old boys 
were taken to the Alachua Regional Juvenile Detention Center on Tuesday after they said they stole items from about 50 unlocked cars.
GPD Officers Bernard Ex-
avier and Jesus Rivera dis-covered that youths had been involved in a rash of car bur-glaries along Southwest 20th Avenue and Southwest 62nd Boulevard, according to an email from GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
The two officers spoke 
with one of the boys who lived nearby, and he con-fessed to a specific burglary. He also identified a friend who was involved, accord-ing to the email.
The second boy said they 
had stolen items from about 50 cars with unlocked doors, according to the email. 
Tobias said he didn’t 
know what specific items were taken.

Six months after the 13th Street 
Walmart relocated, officials and de-
velopers say the future of the build-ing in the 17-acre shopping complex is unclear.
In January, Walmart vacated the 
building at 2649 NW 13th St., and later moved to 5700 NW 23rd St. 
Adam Basch, the head of inves-
tor relations for Kite Realty Group, which owns the property, said he couldn’t disclose information about the future of the building yet.  
“I can tell you that we’re work-
ing on it, and there is a plan,” Basch said. “It’s clearly an important thing we are focused on, but timing is flu-id at this point.” 
The vacant building, once an an-
chor store for the shopping center, has left surrounding businesses ach-ing for the days when customers — attracted by Walmart — were easier to come by.  
Shannon Coleman, store manag-
er of the retail shop Simply Fashion, said although her store still accom-modates a base of loyal customers, it’s seen a significant decrease in customers since Walmart closed.
“Traffic is low, and it sucks,” she 
said. Jennifer Hutchinson, co-man-ager of Simply Fashion, agreed.
“It’s like a ghost town,” she said. Cassie Vientos, a supervisor at 
Beall’s Outlet, said the store has ex-perienced a 15 percent decrease in sales.
“Everyone forgets we are over 
here now,” she said. 
Commissioner Thomas Hawkins 
said an idea for the area is to rezone the location to make a potential re-development process easier and bet-ter. However, he said, plans for the lot are still undecided. 
Erik Bredfeldt, the economic de-
velopment director for the City of Gainesville, said although the city currently has no plans for the prop-erty, it’s important to consider op-tions to help the businesses. 
“It’s something we’re interested 
in seeing move forward,” he said. “We aren’t quite sure what that looks like. But to the extent that the city can help facilitate ... or work through some of those issues — that’s what’s important to us.”

Straight from Puerto Rico, rock ‘n’ roll has taken on a 
new child cradled in its upbeat style: Message to Venus.
Jandre Nadal, vocals and guitar; Edgar Ramos, bass; 
JuanMa Font, drums; and John Feliciano, guitar, united in 
2009 to create another rock band — but with a little soul and a lot of cohesive melding of talent. 
The group’s single “Universal You” was one of 18 vid-
eos on the YouTube channel, but it struck me as a good indication of where the band is headed. For an unsigned band, even the music video was decent. What really struck me, aside from how smoothly both guitars played together, was the drumming, which really stood out as an intricate contribution to the rock sound. Although, I am a sucker for good drumming.
“Message to Venus band members have been influenced 
by musical greats such as Deftones, Depeche Mode, Dream Theater, Tool, STP and many others,” said Lani Niemeier, manager of the official street team for Message to Venus.
In March 2010, their first single “Cold & Grey” put the 
newly assimilated band on the map. After their first EP was released in February 2011, the band used its rock vision to create the new Message to Venus album, “Victims & Vil-lains,” which will be released later this year.
Along with fellow rockers Dead Fish Handshake, Mes-
sage to Venus has embarked on its first tour in the U.S. They are currently No. 1 on ReverbNation for Miami rock.
And now they’re making their way to Gainesville.It’s easy to see by the music video for their song “Change” 
that the group not only plays well together but has as much fun on stage as people in the audience do. At Backstage Lounge at 8 p.m. June 21, see for yourself.

I enjoy being in college, but it can be stress-
ful at times. After a long semester of studying, 
I like to let loose, have fun and see new places via traveling. The problem is that travel is ex-pensive nowadays. You have to be creative and resourceful if you want to save money on things like airfare, accommodations and the day-to-day expenses of being on the road. 
I’ve gone traveling several times through-
out the past four years, and I’ve been to nine countries in Europe. I carry about 10 pounds of gear when I backpack across the continent, and I spend about $50 a day, which includes lodging. Tickets for planes and trains usually add up to about $2,000 or a little less.
If you plan your trip and research ways 
to save money, then you can have lots of fun traveling — even on a limited budget.
Handling Your Finances While Travel-
ing:
Invest in a credit card: When you travel, 
you have to take very good care of your mon-ey because chances are you don’t have much of it. According to the www.creditcardinsid-er.com, one thing that helps young travelers is having a credit card on hand. It is very useful during these times because you never know when you might run out of cash in a foreign country. Fortunately, ATMs are everywhere, so your card can be a good safety net for you while you’re gone.
Last year I wanted to go backpacking 
around Europe but didn’t have the money to do so. I had saved up some money from working part time but not nearly enough to fund an international trip. So I took a friend’s advice and applied for a student credit card. This allowed me to travel for a whole month and not worry about running out of money, exchange rates — they are figured in auto-matically — and pickpocketers looking for people with cash. 
Now, I’m not suggesting that all travelers 
need a credit card, but it has a lot of perks that have helped me with my vagabond experi-ences as a frugal traveler.
Cheap Accommodations, From Hotels to 
Hostels:Hotels can be expensive, so I never end up 
staying in one when I travel. Even so-called budget hotels often cost more than $100 per night, and this can quickly strain the budget of any college student. Instead, I always try to stay at youth hostels. 
You can research hos-
tels online or in travel books, or you can com-pare a group of hostels on various sites. This will also let you easily locate the nearest hostel wherever you are. Most hostels charge very rea-sonable rates — usually 
less than $40 per night. I would recommend trying to find one outside the city limits as they are even cheaper.
Hostels differ in terms of size, amenities 
and conditions. Some may be filled up dur-ing popular travel seasons, so it’s a good idea to book in advance. If you arrive at the last minute hoping to find a room, you are gam-bling. Hostels are great places to meet other trav-
elers and will often have coupons to help you save on food and beverages. They are usually centrally located — near train stations or city centers.
Working While Traveling:It’s not as simple as applying overseas. If 
you want to travel for an extended period of time, such as the whole summer, you may want to work in order to make some spend-ing money. However, as in most countries, you need a work visa to legally work. Yet there are usually opportunities to pick up casual work. This depends on the place and time of year of course, but restaurants and bars are great spots for students.
Another possibility in some places is tu-
toring students in English. This is especially true in Asian countries, where English teach-ers are in high demand. While official jobs usually have to be arranged ahead of time, you can often find casual jobs by introducing yourself to a bar owner or to the manager at your hostel. I have tried this several times, and it can be done.

According to some historical 
legend, 16th century Spanish ex-
plorer Juan Ponce de Leon made a remarkable discovery in Yucatan, Mexico: the Fountain of Youth.
This is a pool of water so re-
storative that the consumption of the native potion could, as docu-mented by writers and contempo-rary historians of Ponce de Leon’s years, work miracles as it rejuve-nated the bodies of aged men.
Yet as time has and will con-
tinue to tell, this myth, like many others, maintains its breath in the push and pull between hope and reality.
Such conﬂ  icting dynamic lies 
at the heart of “The Quest for the Fountain of Youth in Florida His-tory, Mythology and Art,” an art exhibition at the Thomas Center’s main gallery through June 22.
The exhibition presents a group 
of artworks created by contempo-rary Florida artists that excavate numerous interpretations of the Fountain of Youth’s relationship to the sunshine state. A project that distinguishes the 500th anni-versary of Ponce de Leon’s arrival to Florida shores, it is part of a statewide commemoration of this important event. 
The majority of the artwork 
showcased was completed speciﬁ  -cally for this project and was se-lected according to artist proposals that best ﬁ  t the exhibition’s inqui-ry. From painting to photography and realism to abstraction, the 62 original artworks on display afﬁ  rm that the subject of youth is merely a concept relative to beholders and open to interpretation. 
The exhibition was organized  with ﬁ  ve themes: history/docu-mentation, continuation, popular culture, mythology and geology. Each of these themes is introduced with a text panel that explains to visitors the ways in which the se-lected ideas not only connect the Fountain of Youth to the state of Florida but also provide open-ended prompts for artistic transla-tion.What really stands out within 
the exhibition is a collection of artworks which are unpredictably harmonious in their perception of the Fountain of Youth’s possibili-ties.
Cultural Affairs Programs Co-
ordinator for the city of Gainesville Department of Parks and Recre-ation and Cultural Affairs, Russell Etling oversees the programming of the Thomas Center galleries.
Etling said Mallory O’Connor, 
curator of the “The Quest for the Fountain of Youth in Florida His-tory,” had been organizing this ex-hibition for a couple of years. 
Funded by the Florida Hu-
manities Council, this exhibition is intended to be a catalyst for ques-tioning ways in which Florida’s history and cultural identity shape public perceptions of the state.
“The artworks in the exhibition 
are quite diverse — from very tra-ditional, exquisite oil paintings to mobiles of found objects to digital displays,” Etling said. “And the themes are also broad — from his-torical subjects to wonderful pho-tographs, such as those by Gary Monroe of senior citizens exercis-ing on the beach.”
Other highlights of “The Quest 
for the Fountain of Youth in Flor-ida History” include, but are cer-tainly not limited to, Gainesville artist Margaret Ross Tolbert’s enormous oil and canvas compo-sition entitled “Silver Glen Well” (2012), a delectably abstract paint-ing engulfed by a rich wash of aqua hues afﬁ  xed to the canvas by sweeping brushstrokes. 
The work shares a wall with 
two acrylic paintings by artist John Wilton of DeLand. Using a much cleaner, pop-inspired technique, Wilton’s paintings “Searching” and “Finding” employ the sil-houette of a scuba diver adrift in a concept of the unknown, which is posited both below and above the water’s surface. Such works are a few of the many examples of visual diversity presented within the exhibition.
“The thing about Florida is 
that people have been coming here for decades to kind of re-ﬁ  ne their youth and stay young,” Etling said. “So even though there isn’t an actual fountain, there is a metaphorical one in what Florida means to people.”
“The Quest for the Fountain of 
Youth in Florida History, Mythol-ogy and Art” was curated by Mal-lory O’Connor of Oconnorart, LLC and ran as a collaborative with an exhibition hosted at the Doris Bar-don Community Cultural Center in Gainesville. A traveling show composed of 30 works selected from the two exhibitions is also planned to tour throughout Flori-da this year.

Trends — sometimes no one 
knows what to think about them. 
They either can be very ingenious fashion pieces, or they can make you think, “What the hell is this crap?”
Once a trend fades out, it usu-
ally never comes back — but not for certain accessories and clothes. Some are coming back this fall, according to ELLE mag-azine. And they aren’t the awe-some trends that most of us love.
Here are the top 11 trends that 
should have stayed dead:
11. The Trucker Hat:Um, this was a trend? For 
13-year-old girls maybe. But ap-parently the trucker hat was seen in Marc Jacobs’ line this season and has made a comeback. This look could be pulled off at the beach or on a casual shopping day, but it definitely wouldn’t work any other time.
10. Overalls:Annnnnd it’s back — this 
trend is by far one of the worst. Nothing can make overalls ap-pear attractive. (Well, maybe Victoria Beckham…) But denim overalls are very in this season and are even being paired with cropped blazers and heels.
9. Colored Mascara:Wearing colored mascara can 
be a cute trend. Shades like plums and violets look exceptionally well during the nighttime — es-pecially girls with green, brown or hazel eyes — so this trend isn’t awful. However, it can look amateur if you wear wild colors, so watch out for too much over-load.
8. The Logo Sweater:Fashion clothing lines like 
Nasty Gal have made logo sweat-ers popular again. Donning hi-larious sayings or your favorite super hero can be tastefully done or can be a huge disaster. And the wilder the saying — the better.
7. Bootcut 
Jeans:
It is true. 
Bootcut jeans are back. But this trend should be worn sparingly 
(e.g. work and other business events). Honestly, this trend de-pends on the girl and whether the bootcut style looks good on her.
6. The White Heel:
I think this trend came back only because it’s summer time and due to the fact that “The Great Gatsby” movie is out. White heels are old-fashioned and are noth-ing compared to black heels. This trend should have stayed dead.
5. The Perm:Fact: Nobody gets perms any-
more. Or should I say instead, no-body should get perms anymore. Curls have always had a way of weaving in and out of style, but getting a perm is going too far.
4. The Crop Top:Due to the amount of midriff 
baring this trend promotes,  crop tops should have never come back. Not only does it not serve a purpose, but it also doesn’t look good. Who wants to wear an ex-pensive shirt that comes with half the material you’re supposed to get?3. The Plaid Flannel:This trend isn’t too bad. But 
flannel should be worn only in the fall and winter. At least you can pair this with a cute pair of jeans and combat boots and still look cute.
2. White Eyeliner:Eyeliner is made black for a 
reason. Do I need to go any fur-ther?
1. Hair Mousse:I don’t think hair mousse 
ever went out of style…but OK. For the naturally curly-haired women, this is great news. Not only can you save yourself from spending an excessive amount of time on your hair, but you will also look great tossing in some mousse and showing off those gorgeous curls.

Gainesville Community Playhouse’s 
membership director Susan Christophy 
hosted the Playhouse’s first Director’s Showcase on Saturday at the Vam York Theater at 4039 NW 16th Blvd.
The event aimed to educate Gainesville 
residents interested in becoming involved with the 2013-2014 lineup of plays and musicals. From acting and singing to set and costume design to advertising and ushering, everyone, regardless of experi-ence, was welcome to participate.
“Community theater is how the every-
day person can involve himself in the arts and be creative,” Christophy said. “We create art here, and we do it together.”
Auditions for Ken Ludwig’s comedy 
“Lend Me a Tenor,” directed by Carlos Francisco Asse, will be held June 23-24, and the show runs from Sept. 13-29. This humorous tale depicts a historic night at the Cleveland Opera Company, where world-famous tenor Tito Morelli is sched-uled to perform in “Otello.” Through a series of mishaps, Morelli receives a double dose of tranquilizers, causing the house manager to believe he is dead, which results in a chain reaction of slap-stick humor and mistaken identity. 
Rhonda Wilson will direct Lynn Ah-
rens’ and Stephen Flaherty’s “Seussical,” a musical adaptation combining several of Dr. Seuss’ most beloved children’s stories. Auditions will be held on Aug. 25-26, and the show runs Nov. 29 to Dec. 22.
“(‘Seussical’) is an adult show with 
childlike elements,” Wilson said. “It mix-es gospel and pop as well as elements of traditional musical theater.”
Dan Christophy will direct “Aida,” 
based on the book by David Henry Hwang, Linda Woolverton and Robert Falls. With lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Elton John, this pop opera tells the sto-ry of an enslaved Nubian princess, Aida, who falls for the captain of the guard Ra-dames. He is betrothed to an Egyptian princess — Aida’s mistress. Auditions take place at the Gainesville Community 
Playhouse on Nov. 10-11, and the show runs from Jan. 31 to Feb. 23.
Erin Kleim will direct 
“Noises Off.” It’s Michael Frayn’s comedy about a play within a play star-ring a second-rate com-
pany of hopelessly unprepared British actors on opening night of their poorly written show. Auditions will be held Jan. 12-13, and the show runs from March 28  to April 13.
Auditions for Stephen Sondheim’s “Into the Woods,” directed by Margery Pierson, will be held March 9 -10, and the show runs May 23 to June 15. A childless baker and his wife attempt to lift their family’s curse by journeying into the woods, where they encounter a range of classic fairy tale characters, from Rapun-zel to Red Riding Hood to Cinderella.
The final show of the year, directed by 
Susan Christophy, the 1976 Tony Award winner for best musical, “A Chorus Line,” about a group of 17 Broadway dancers who bare their souls as they audition for an unnamed Broadway musical. Audi-tions will be held May 4-5, and the show runs July 18 through August 10, 2014.
For the 2013-2014 season, the 
Gainesville Community Playhouse is re-placing Wednesday night performances with an extra Saturday matinee.

Alternative music lovers can look forward 
to new music by The Maine, a ﬁ  ve-man rock 
band that hails from Arizona. The dudes put out their 12-song album June 4 titled “For-ever Halloween.”
One of the best things about The Maine 
members is their ability to perform so well 
together. In their six years as a group, they have released four studio albums and a few EPs and have embarked on tours around the world. People everywhere enjoy them, and I must say this new album has some notewor-thy songs.
The ﬁ  rst on the album, “Take What You 
Can Carry,” has an awesome intro. It’s the kind of song that could open a show and probably the best on the album next to one of the singles, “Happy.” The record has some great songs to jam to, but it incorporates slow-er ones as well, like, “These Four Words” and “Birthday in Los Angeles.”
You never know what you’ll get with The 
Maine. When the band began, it was put-ting out mostly upbeat, poppy songs. As the group continues to make music, it has moved toward the alternative rock category.
True fans of the band 
will really be able to appre-ciate “Forever Halloween,” as it marks progress and maturity for the guys. It is different from anything they have put out in the past. Even new listeners 
will be impressed by the album’s variety.
Overall, the band has really switched 
things up with this album and put a work of art into the music world that shows growth. John O’Callaghan’s voice sounds better than ever, the instrumental sections of the tracks are pleasing and lyrics are well written. I give it an A.

reveals new side of band� ‘BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS’ 
COMES TO CONSTANS THEATRE.
DAVID A. MURPHY
Avenue Writer
All Eugene Jerome wants is to have 
fun: Girls and a carefree life are his meth-
ods.
“Brighton Beach Memoirs,” which 
takes place in 1937, tells the story of 15-year-old Jerome and his family, whose Old World traditions are challenged by a world on the brink of imminent war.
The semi-autobiographical Neil Simon 
comedy debuted at the UF Constans The-atre at the Nadine M. McGuire Theatre and Dance Pavilion Wednesday and will run through Sunday, with a return en-gagement July 9-14.
This is the ﬁ  rst Neil Simon play to be 
presented by the UF School of Theatre + Dance in at least a quarter of a century.
Kevin Roost, a 20-year-old theatre per-
formance senior, plays Jerome. This is his ﬁ  rst lead performance at UF. He said the play is very quick and engaging.
“People will ﬁ  nd connections to every 
character in the play,” Roost said.  
UF theatre and dance professor Judith 
Williams is directing the comedy. She said 
“Brighton Beach Memoirs” is a personal Neil Simon favorite of hers.
“I like what it says about family, what’s 
really important in life,” Williams said.
Williams and Roost stress the impor-
tance of family relationships in the play. During this uncertain time, Jerome must depend on his family.
The success of “Brighton Beach Mem-
oirs” led to two more plays about Jerome: “Biloxi Blues” and “Broadway Bound.”
Roost said he hopes “Brighton Beach 
Memoirs” will continue its success at UF.
“I don’t want this play to go unrecog-
nized,” Roost said. “I don’t want it to be written off.”
Tickets are $17 for the general public 
and $13 for students, faculty, senior citi-zens and the military. Tickets may be pur-chased from the University Box Ofﬁ  ce at 352-392-1653 or www.ticketmaster.com.Comedy makes UF debutmusic

Connecting our donors to our patients� Shuck replaced 2-year 
old o!o Garden Grille.
KATHLEEN BOYLE 
Avenue Writer
Attention Midtown Gainesville 
prowlers: A new destination is making waves on your stomping 
ground, and it’s in your best interest to take note. Shuck Raw Bar and Sea-food Restaurant has moved into the hut and patio space formerly known as O!O Garden Grille — ready to fill your gullets and satisfy your spirits with food and drinks. 
The core of Shuck’s offerings is largely based on Key West sensibili-ties. From raw, fresh shucks to spe-cialty oysters garnished with citrus relish, the menu boasts an array of options that bring an essence of salt air to the swamp. But for those who  have an aversion to the slimy, chewy texture of mollusks, plenty of other options are offered that may better appeal to your senses. 
Crispy buffalo calamari, mac-
and-cheese bites, blackened fish sandwiches and the traditional Cobb salad are a few of the alternative se-lections available to savor.
Shuck is in the heart of Midtown’s 
nightlife destinations, near The Swamp Restaurant and right behind 101 Cantina. As a result, this spot takes on a Jekyll and Hyde persona. The relaxed sunlit atmosphere amps up its energy as the night creeps into late hours, inviting patrons to flirt at the outdoor bar illuminated by lantern string lights draped in tree branches. Well aware of the neigh-borhood’s literal night-and-day con-trast, Shuck embraces the transition with a daily toast of complimentary shots at sunset for all guests 21 and older.
Shuck furthers the Midtown 
reputation as the neighborhood to see and be seen by employing a bar and wait staff that is very friendly, extremely attractive and primar-ily female, adorning fitted tank tops and short khaki shorts. Combine this with the bar’s big flat screens that broadcast various sporting events, and it doesn’t take very long to detect the type of demographic this water-ing hole is targeting. Because of this, Shuck is probably not the best choice for a first-, second- or even third-date spot. Instead, file this destination as a place to discover your next romance, chill with a big group of friends or kick back with your steady sweet-heart on a lazy afternoon.16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 13, 2013

customers at Shuck raw Bar and restaurant in Midtown sit outside 
watching TV at the bar and chatting among friends. They can enjoy

you like to get some Mediocre Advice? Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Ariel Barnes Dear Mediocre Advice,
I really want to hook up with this guy I’ve 
been mad flirting with, but I’m a little hesitant 
because I can’t tell how big or small his penis is. It would be terrible if it was small after all of 
this buildup. What’s a girl to do?
Dear Friend,
It is unfair that guys know what they’re getting when 
they go home with a girl. You know how big her boobs are, and the rest is pretty easy to guess. Girls can only judge on so many factors like confidence, height, eth -
nic background and even the size of their hands — it gets pretty desperate. I like to think I’m good at guess -
ing the size of a guy’s junk, but it’s a superpower I know I’ll never fully obtain. Find out what’s beneath those pants. It is a major disappointment when your expectations are not met, but what if it’s everything you imagined it would be? What if it’s even better than you had imagined? And what if someone else got to it 
first? You need to make a move before it’s too late.
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I love my guy friends, but recently I’ve no -
ticed that they’re into these dumb, bland girls. 
I don’t understand it. Who are these girls, and 
how are they getting all of the good guys?
Dear Friend,
These girls are called “basic b------s.” 
How their dry personalities and average faces get the most sought-after guys is an enigma. Without fail, each encounter with a basic b---- is painfully boring. It’s accept -
able to be jealous even if you’re not into the guy she’s with because it’s an insult if someone who is as exciting as a vegeta -
ble gets more attention than you. Perhaps their vaginas have a built-in Brookstone massager. It’s either that or some involve -
ment in black magic or sorcery.Dear Mediocre Advice,
What’s your number?
Dear Friend,
“I don’t understand the question, and I won’t 
respond to it,” is what Lucille Bluth from “Arrest -
ed Development” would say in this situation. But here are some actually interesting numbers:
2 — packages of bacon I have in my fridge 
right now. It’s not enough, I know.
8 — number of crop tops I own. I thought I 
would have more, too.
3 — the amount of times I watched “Titanic” 
in theaters.
5 — the amount of times I thought there was 
a spider on my leg while driving.
5 — the amount of times there was actually 
just a strand of hair on my leg and not a spider.ARIEL BARNES

Ray Leung, the executive chef of Dragonfly Sushi and Sake 
Company, sets the bar for Japanese cuisine.
He has trained alongside Japanese Iron Chef Masaharu Mo-
rimoto and became the executive chef of Dragonfly Sushi at the 
age of 21. This year he was named a Best Chef by “Best Chefs America” — a peer review  method that identifies America’s best chefs. He may seem intimidating when you’re on the other side of the sushi line, but getting him to crack a smile is easier than you may think.
Leung grew up in Hong Kong playing ping-pong for fun 
and always had the best lunch of all of his classmates. 
“They looked at me weird because I had the weird food,” 
Leung said. 
While the other kids ate ham-and-
cheese sandwiches, Leung’s lunchbox con-tained gourmet noodles and fish. When asked about his most recent success, win-ning the Iron Chef Gainesville competition, he claims he was not nervous. 
“It’s what we do every day. It’s just 
cooking. We’re in there for one reason — to strive and cook with our heart,” he said. 
The judges at the competition may have seemed intimidat-
ing, but Leung disagreed. 
“No one there was better than anybody. Once you’re in the 
kitchen, you get to work,” he said. “You grind and try to pro-duce food out of love.”
The dynamics of leading a kitchen has little to do with food.“It’s not about cooking; it’s about people-managing,” he 
said. “It’s important to understand your crew and each and ev-ery single personality throughout the kitchen.”
On the night of the competition, Dragonfly was dead silent. 
After the win, members of the kitchen returned to the restau-rant. Employees applauded, praising every member as they walked through the doors. They cheered as Leung raised his trophy and gave high-fives all around. Applause and shouting echoed throughout the restaurant until closing.
On Leung’s days off, he sleeps in and watches TV like ev-
eryone else. Golf tees are scattered around his apartment like guitar picks. When he first started Dragonfly in Orlando, Leung worked for 90 consecutive days.
“It was a piece of cake,” he said. “It’s because I was commit-
ted, passionate and driven.”
For those looking to pursue a career in the culinary arts, Le-
ung said, “You’re in or you’re out. You have to be fully commit-ted, and you have to love it. There is no thinking that it might work. No one wants to eat food prepared by a mediocre chef.”Ray Leung, top chef

STRAIGHT NCAA OUTDOOR TITLE IN 
THE TRIPLE JUMP ON SATURDAY. 
GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer
 
The college career of one of Florida 
men’s track and field’s most decorated 
athletes has come to a close.
Omar Craddock, an All-American triple 
jumper for the Gators, finished his tenure at Florida with a bang last Saturday in Eugene, Ore., at the 2013 NCAA Outdoor Championships.
In his final jump as a Gator, Craddock, 
the South Region Men’s Field Athlete of the Year, jumped an all-conditions person-al best distance of 16.92 meters. 
Oddly enough, he had already clinched 
the event victory – his second consecutive at NCAA Outdoors – before he took the jump.
Craddock’s final jump was the spark 
that fueled Florida to its second consecu-tive outdoor title. After his jump, the Gators rallied to tie Texas A&M by earning 28 out of a possible 30 points.  
“My plan was to defend my title and 
get the ‘A’ standard for Worlds this sum-mer,” Craddock said. “I did one of those and there’s time for the other. I wanted to get 10 points for my team and I did that. I wanted my first jump to motivate Ed-die (Lovett) and the relays, and I think I helped.”
In Craddock’s four years at UF, he has 
been on five national championship teams (three indoor, two outdoor), while win-ning three individual titles himself. All of his individual titles have come in the last two years. 
In his final outdoor season, Craddock 
won all five events in which he competed, defending both his Southeastern Confer-ence and NCAA titles from the previous outdoor season.    
“He’s really grown as a person here,” 
coach Mike Holloway said. “If you talk to Omar, the most gratifying thing from him is that he’s always found a way to get it done when it counts. Even when Christian (Taylor) and Will (Claye) were here, he was always a presence. Now, those guys left, their shadow is gone, and it was Omar Craddock’s turn.”
More than his success on the track, 
Craddock’s savvy has been a boon for a very young team.
“He knows how to explain to the lower 
classmen what to expect from the program and how we operate here,” Holloway said. “He’s very passionate. In our team meet-ings, I let him talk to the team about how we do things here at Florida. That’s very helpful to me and the staff to have people come in and buy into what we do.”
Craddock’s last two NCAA titles 
bumped Florida’s winning streak up to seven in the men’s triple jump – a streak first set by former Gators Taylor and Claye. The impact they left on Craddock was significant. 
“Being here at Florida has meant so 
much,” Craddock said. “I’m so grateful, fortunate and glad to have been granted the opportunity to be at Florida and train with some of the best jumpers in NCAA history like Christian, Will, and now, Marquis (Dendy). ... I’ll never forget the memories I’ve created, the teammates I’ve trained with and the chance to have been a part of history.” Craddock wraps up college career with event title

When former Florida catch-
er Mike Zunino was drafted 
third overall in last June’s MLB First-Year Player Draft, it was assumed he would make it to the big leagues eventually. 
Few could envision it hap-
pening this quickly. 
After one year and six days, 
Zunino rocketed through the Seattle Mariners’ minor league system and was called up to the majors on Tuesday. 
Zunino made his MLB de-but Wednesday night, starting at No. 6 in the batting order in Seattle’s home matchup against 
the Houston Astros.
The only other catcher on 
the Mariners’ depth chart is 
Kelly Shoppach. 
“I don’t think I could have 
pictured this a year ago, that this is where I’d be,” Zunino told Greg Johns of MLB.com. “It’s exceeded everything I’ve ever dreamed of. So I’ll just em-brace it and take it as it comes.”

The hopes of capturing another outdoor champi-
onship lied on the shoulders of a freshman. 
Arman Hall anchors the men’s 4x400m relay – 
the final event of every NCAA championship meet. 
As a 19-year-old competing at the historic Hayward Field for the NCAA Championships, Hall wasn’t influenced by the pressure of competing on a big stage. 
“I don’t think it was too intimidating for me,” 
Hall said. “It just made me excited. Again, I’m a freshman, and I made it to the finals. To help my team out to win a national championship for the second year in a row is a great feeling.”
Hall was at the center of the now infamous Texas A&M baton drop. He was issued a sizable lead to maintain in the final lap. All he had to do was main-tain it. 
“The only thing on my mind 
was winning,” said Hall. “I saw A&M drop the stick from first leg to second leg. All I had to do was win it for my team.”
He did just that, ending the 
competition with a season-best finish for the men’s 4x4 squad. 
At the start of the season, Hall 
wasn’t anchoring the event. 
But he was destined to, according to coach Mike 
Holloway. 
“He’s my fastest quarter-miler,” Holloway said. Freshman anchor seals NCAA title

Hall ready for USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships
“When he walked on campus, he wanted to 
be the anchor man. Indoors, he was a little dinged up. Outdoors, I anchored Dedric Dukes because he had more experience and was healthier. I said (to Hall), ‘When you’re ready to anchor, let me know.’ Af-ter the Texas Relays, he said he was ready. He’s been on ever since, and I think people saw why.”
Aside from his speed, Hall’s poise is 
one of the main reasons why he anchors the 4x4 as a freshman. 
Hall, Dukes and Hugh Graham Jr. grew 
up in South Florida and competed at world tournaments together. 
“We all knew how it felt to be on a 
big stage – three of us were on the world team,” Hall said. “Going on the world cir-cuit really helped me with the 4x4 anchor-ing and being on the big stage itself.”
Hall attributes his success at UF to Hol-
loway’s hands-on coaching style.   
“Coach Holloway is the main reason I 
came here,” Hall said. 
“He takes his time to help us train and 
(explain) the race model he wants us to do. He makes sure we’re in our comfort zone when we run.”
It seems Hall is pretty comfortable an-
choring the 4x4. 
With the NCAA track and field season 
officially over, and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships one week away, there’s only one thing left on Hall’s mind.
“All I know is that we’re getting rings,” 
he said.

Montero is also injured, and is ex-pected to miss 4-6 weeks after tear-ing his meniscus. Montero was re-cently demoted to Triple-A Tacoma after tallying a .208 batting average and three home runs in 29 games. He may face suspension thanks to his alleged involvement with a Mi-ami Biogenesis clinic.
The veteran Shoppach has ap-
peared in 35 games behind the plate for the Mariners with less than stel-lar results, hitting .196 and only .056 with runners in scoring position.
Brandon Bantz was called up on 
June 5 and was designated for as-signment less than a week later on June 11. In one game, he went 0 for 2 at the plate. 
With Bantz off of the major 
league roster and a catching platoon in turmoil, Seattle called up Zunino because it did not have many other options. 
He came into professional base-
ball as a highly touted prospect, winning the Dick Howser Trophy, Golden Spikes Award and Johnny Bench Award in his junior year. At Florida, Zunino was also a two-time All-American.. 
He is now the sixth player from the 2012 draft to make it to the Major League level.
Prior to his call-up on Tuesday, 
Zunino was hitting .238 with 43 RBIs and 11 home runs for Triple-A Tacoma. 
“He’s a mature kid,” Mariners 
general manager Jack Zduriencik said. “We were all impressed with what he did in spring training. But I don’t think anybody here is expect-ing miracles. We’re not looking like he’s the answer. We’re just looking as we put this together and where we’re at right now, we know he’s going to be a guy that is counted on going forward, and it’s the right thing to do at this time for him. So we’ll bring him up here, give him a chance to play and see how it works out.”

The final day of the MLB Draft 
had a few surprises, and the Bos-
ton Red Sox’s selection of Gators starting quarterback Jeff Driskel was one of them. 
The Red Sox picked Driskel 
863rd overall in the 29th round as an outfielder Saturday in the MLB First-Year Player Draft – a move that shocked many, includ-ing Driskel. 
“Got drafted by the Red Sox 
today. Did not see that coming,” Driskel posted on his Twitter ac-count (@jeffdriskel) following the selection. 
The 6-foot-4 rising junior has 
not played baseball since his days at Hagerty High in Oviedo, where he was a two-sport athlete. 
The next day on Twitter, 
Driskel made it clear that he has no plans of leaving UF. 
“@jeffdriskel You gonna join 
us?! #RedSox,” former Gators and current Red Sox pitcher Bri-an Johnson (@Brian_Johnson35) posted. 
Replied Driskel: “no sir lol.”Driskel’s decision to stay with 
the Gators was not a shock to his former baseball coaches at Hager-ty.
“He is not the kind of person 
to change directions until he has completely fulfilled his current duty,” said Derek Griffith, Hager-ty assistant athletic director and pitching coach. 
Driskel was an elite prospect at 
center fielder on Hagerty’s base-ball squad, where he showcased his speed and arm strength. Some MLB scouts projected him to be a top-100 pick in the 2011 draft.
But Driskel enrolled at Florida 
in the spring of 2011 to get a head start with the football program, forgoing his final semester of high school and repelling teams from drafting him.
“Choosing to go early was 
probably his best option so that he could get acquainted with the offense and gets a head start on all the other opponents,” said Dy-lan Ortega, Driskel’s former high school baseball teammate.
“Based off talent, I thought he 
could play [baseball] at a top-level program. I think he would’ve been a first- or second-round pick.”
But Driskel always had a great-
er passion for football. Hagerty baseball coach Jered 
Goodwin said he has always sup-ported his former player because he believes Driskel’s decisions have been well thought out.“He told me his junior year 
that he wanted to leave high school early because he wanted to be the Gators’ QB,” Goodwin said. “That’s all I needed to hear to know he made the right deci-sion. We still talk weekly and see each other a lot and there are no regrets. He for sure made the right decision.”THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SAN ANTONIO — A day 
later, LeBron James didn’t back 
down.
When the Miami Heat were 
embarrassed by 36 points in Game 3 of the NBA Finals, James took all the blame and even lauded his teammates for playing great. Shortly after that 113-77 debacle of a Spurs’ victory ended Tues-day night, James insisted that he would do enough to change the way the Heat compete in Game 4.
And Wednesday, James’ tune 
was the same.
“I’m putting all the pressure 
on my chest, on my shoulders to come through for our team,” James said. “That’s the way it is.”
That’s not necessarily the 
same game plan that Heat coach Erik Spoelstra would prefer, but by now, it’s just become assumed that when the stakes are high-est, it’s all going to be on James anyway, whether that’s the ac-tual reality or not. If the Heat win Game 4, odds are James will be credited as the reason why. If they lose Game 4 and go one loss away from elimination, then it’ll be widely considered as James’ failure.
“Look, we have great confi-
dence from our guys and their ability to bounce back and re-spond in a big way,” Spoelstra said. “And that’s all our focus is the next 24 hours — how do we prepare ourselves to play our best game of the series tomorrow night. That’s the only thing that matters. LJ has proven himself enough in this league and on the biggest stage. He is going to ... he’ll be better.”
Heat guard Dwyane Wade 
added: “We’re not worried about LeBron. He’s going to find his way. He’s going to get in a groove. As teammates you try to figure out a way to get him an easy basket in a breakout, try to get it back to him, get a lay-up, so he can see the ball go in. As a scorer you need to see it go in.”
Strangely, some of the Spurs 
sound as if they’re not concerned about James either.
Danny Green has had a phe-
nomenal start to these finals, and James’ former Cleveland team-mate raised a couple eyebrows after Game 3 when he said that while the Spurs were executing their plan against him as they would hope, the reigning and overall four-time NBA MVP was hurting his own cause as well.
“I’m just saying, we all know 
what he’s capable of doing,” Green said. “I don’t know what’s going on, but he’s not playing his best basketball right now. It’s not just us. We’re doing a decent job of making it tough for him, but I don’t know what’s going on. He’s not playing LeBron basketball. ... It could be a number of things. It could be stuff going on behind the scenes.”The 36-point loss matched the 
largest that James has endured in his career, and his minus-32 rating was the worst of his 899 previous games. He was 7 for 21 from the field — his shooting has been subpar in every game so far in this series — and did not get to the foul line, a byproduct of both the Spurs taking driving lanes away and James shooting the jumpers that San Antonio is daring him to try.
Spoelstra said the Heat would 
find ways on the film to clean up some of the many issues from Game 3. Wade had a far more succinct approach.
“As players I think we figured 
it out in the game,” Wade said. “We’re playing terrible. So the film session just brings it to light a little more. It’s not really much we can learn from that, from the standpoint of schemes, we just have to do what we do a lot bet-ter versus the team.”
The way James was talking on 
Wednesday, it’s all-or-nothing time for the Heat.
“It’s just something we’ve 
grown over the years, being able to bounce back in adverse situations,” James said. “And no matter the circumstances, this is going to be probably one of the toughest, because ... we’re going against a team with champion-ship DNA and championship pedigree on the floor and a must-win. We’re going to be ready for it.”THURSDAY, JUNE 13, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 23

Red Sox’s interest surprises Driskel, past high school coaches
“Got drafted by the Red

Gators quarterback   A day after Tim Tebow’s release from the New 
York Jets, the Omaha Beef – an indoor football team 
in Nebraska – offered the former Florida quarter-back a roster spot and $75 per game. Forty-one days later, the New England Patriots trumped the Beef’s offer, signing Tebow to a two-year, non-guaranteed contract. ESPN’s Ed Werder broke the story Mon-day afternoon, and immediately, our Facebook and Twitter feeds exploded. Tebowmania is a big deal – since ESPN tells us it is – so now it’s our turn to take a stab at it. As the hysteria slowly dies down for the time being, alligatorSports assistant editor Landon Watnick and alligatorSports.org editor Chuck Kingsbury will debate if Tebow will succeed in his ﬁ  rst season in Foxborough, Mass.
  Landon: Tebowmania is shallow and pe-
dantic at this point, but I actually think Timo-thy Tebow can bring something positive to the table for an NFL team.
  Media gluttony aside, Tebow can only help 
the Patriots. Not only is he a great teammate, but he’s a great athlete. He proved that in his second season with the Denver Broncos.
  He was erratic throwing the football in 14 
games in 2011-12, but he doesn’t have to play quarterback under coach Bill Belichick. As a 6-foot-3, 236-pound bruiser, he has a good mix of physicality and agility to play tight end, fullback or running back. I have faith in what Belichick will do with him. 
  Don’t forget Josh McDaniels, Tebow’s for-
mer coach in Denver, will be calling the plays. And you know how much of a man-crush Mc-Daniels has on Tebow. 
  Tebow will succeed in his ﬁ  rst season with 
the Pats, but he’ll only experience moderate success. To be fair, anything compared to his last season with the Jets would be considered a success. 
  I’m about to drop possibly the worst pun in 
the history of sports, but it’s time for a Boston Tea-bow Party.
Chuck: Don’t ever drop a pun again, or I’ll 
drop you.
  If the New England Patriots – and more im-
portantly, Belichick – were seriously consider-ing Tebow for a spot on its 53-man roster, he would’ve been signed to a contract with guar-anteed money.
  Without it, he’s at as much of a risk of be-
ing cut as the other 19 undrafted rookie free agents. And the deal won’t even cost New England a ham sandwich if it parts ways with Tebow before the start of  the pre-season. But hey, the Patriots may be trying to prove a point. 
  With a two-
year deal worth $630,000 in base salary in 2013, Tebow could be a low-risk, high-reward play-er. But this seems like a short-lived favor from Belichick to Urban Meyer. 
  
  Landon: Chuck, the only things you’ve 
been dropping lately are deuces. 
  Tebow basically dropped one last season in 
New York. He was pretty bad in limited min-utes, but in all fairness, so was his offensive line the entire year. 
  If Tebow does see snaps at running back or 
fullback, he’ll see a signiﬁ  cant improvement in that department in New England. Throughout his career, he’s only prospered with a good offensive line. 
  In 2011-12, the 
Broncos led the league in rushing 
offense with 2,632 yards – mostly because of the offensive line’s success at run blocking. Tebow rushed for 660 yards that year on only 122 carries. 
  Sure, he might have to adjust to learning 
a new position, but Tebow could ﬁ  nd some success getting carries at the goal line or in the open ﬁ  eld. I don’t see him eclipsing 660 yards, but 200-250 yards on the ground and 3-4 rush-ing touchdowns would constitute a successful season. If he does switch to running back, I see Tebow accomplishing that. 
  I’m not so conﬁ  dent in his hands, but 
Tebow has the size to potentially be a danger-ous target at tight end. I’d really have to see Tebow get some reps in practice at the posi-tion before I determine if he can catch a pass. 
  If he pushes his quarterback dreams to the 
curb, Tebow could be one of many valuable weapons for Tom Brady. 
      Chuck: Ask Brady if he’s cool sitting out a 
snap or two for Tim Tebow.   
  Belichick may project him at tight end – de-
spite his lack of suddenness – and it’s a blue-print that has worked well with few players in recent memory, most notably Mike Vrabel, who lined up at tight end in sub-packages in the red zone during his eight years in Foxbor-ough. 
  But Vrabel was also the starter at weak side 
linebacker, too. 
  Let’s face it – Tebow’s last stand will be in 
New England.   His window is closing rapidly, and the idea that the Patriots would even con-sider sitting him behind Brady for grooming purposes is a ﬂ  uke. 
  Tebow’s poor footwork hasn’t gotten any 
better since his freshman season at UF. He doesn’t go through his progressions. He drifts in the pocket waiting for a receiver to come open and constantly ﬁ  nds himself trying to create plays instead of operating within an offense’s structure. His mechanics haven’t im-proved. 
  And he couldn’t hit water if he was sitting 
in a pool.
  With Ryan Mallet on the depth chart, the 
Patriots reserved just two roster spots for quarterbacks in 2012. There is no chance in hell Belichick clears roster space for a third.
  Even if he changes positions, Tebow will 
be at a disadvantage sitting behind both Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez – arguably the best tight-end combination in the league. 
  I have no faith in Tebow as a potential in-
line blocker, nor do I think he can gain sepa-ration off the line of scrimmage if he were to make the transition to tight end.
  Quite frankly, he has a better shot long 
snapping. But hey, at least he’s a little bit closer to Canada, right?
