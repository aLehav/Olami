The Rev. Steven Baines speaks about the separation of church and state at 6 p.m. Monday in Pugh Hall. Baines is the religious outreach director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
PRESIDENTIAL SEARCH

Through a little divine intervention, the Rev. 
Steven Baines arrived at Pugh Hall on Monday eve-
ning to present a discussion on religious liberty. 
At the event titled “Religious Liberty: What it 
Really Means,” Baines stood in for Barry Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for Separa-tion of Church and State, who could not attend due 
to a health crisis. 
During his presentation, Baines spoke about the 
freedom to choose not to worship any deity.  
“I can’t think of anything that would destroy re-
ligious freedom in our country more than turning our houses of worship into super political action 
committees,” said Baines, the Americans United for Separation of Church and State assistant ﬁ  eld direc-tor and religious outreach director. 
Baines said Americans United was recently in-
volved in the Supreme Court case where it was ruled that the owners of “Hobby Lobby” would not have to pay for their employees’ contraceptives un-der religious freedom.
“This, to me, is probably the most egregious Su-
preme Court decision I have seen in my lifetime,” Baines said.
Baines said it is unfair for employers to trample 
on the rights of women.
Baines’ presentation continued with comments 
on marriage equality. Baines said marriage equality is the biggest debate in America on all sides of the spectrum. 
“Marriage in America is a civil institution,” 
Baines said, emphasizing that marriage is regulated Reverend steps in for scheduled speaker

When Anna Beth West heard about Kan-
garoo Express’ promotion, she was disgust-
ed.
The convenience store chain is offering 
a free 16-ounce coffee to any customer who presents a CVS ExtraCare Health card with a cigarette purchase.  
“I’m very against smoking because it’s so 
terrible for your health,” said West, a 22-year-old ﬁ  rst-year medical student at UF. “It’s re-ally unfortunate that they’re capitalizing on that.”
The store began offering the deal about a 
month ago, said Ashley Garrett, manager of the Kangaroo Express on North Main Street and Northeast 16th Avenue. This came after CVS Health announced in early September that it would stop selling tobacco products.
Along with the ban, CVS Caremark 
changed its name to CVS Health in Sep-tember to better reﬂ  ect its health care com-mitment. The company also rolled out a campaign against smoking, featuring anti-smoking signs and products to help people quit smoking.

The Presidential Search Committee narrowed down a 
pool of 15 applicants to three Monday morning.
Kent Fuchs, Cornell University Provost; David McLaugh-
lin, New York University Provost; and Sibrandes Poppema, 
President of University of Groningen in The Netherlands, were chosen to meet with the committee Tuesday.
“All of these people have academic distinctions that are 
exquisite, and I’m very pleased,” said committee chairman Steven Scott.
UF Provost Joseph Glover withdrew his application Fri-
day and was not among the 15 applicants, said UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes.
Scott told the committee that choosing the next presi-
dent would be a fast process, Sikes said. 
Scott said his wife will be happy when the process is 
over. He said before the committee debated the 15 appli-
cants Monday, he had read 180 resumes and biographies and had ﬂ  own to 10 states.
There were no new applicants this weekend, which was 
unusual, he said.
“I wish more could have come forward, as you can 
imagine,” Scott said. “But the Sunshine Law is not some-
thing everyone is willing to deal with. But we do have a very good pool.”
Search ﬁ  rm Greenwood/Asher & Associates, Inc. was 
paid $95,000, which is low for comparable presidential search services, Sikes said.
UF paid a Los Angeles ﬁ  rm about $90,000 to search for 
the new dean of the UF Levin College of Law last Spring.

in it, all of which are offering the 
deal. 
The Kangaroo Express on West 
University Avenue and Southwest 13th Street is participating in the promotion but hasn’t put out post-ers or signs for it.
Garrett said she thinks the pro-
motion might be an attempt to reach out to customers who pre-viously bought tobacco products from CVS.
Garrett, who said she started her position last Thursday, has seen the promotion used twice, both by the same middle-aged woman.
“It won’t be popular at this loca-
tion because we don’t get a lot of student customers,” she said.
West said she knew CVS stopped 
selling tobacco products but hadn’t heard about Kangaroo Express’ promotion until Monday. 
As a medical student, West 
spent all Monday morning talk-ing to middle schoolers about the negative health effects of smoking, but said it wasn’t her place to tell someone else not to take part in the store’s promotion.
Katlyn Etheridge, 20, said she 
doesn’t smoke but isn’t that upset with the deal.
“People can do what they want,” 
said Etheridge, a UF sophomore.
Santa Fe College graphic design 
junior Natalie Gerber, 21, said she smokes cigarettes every once in a while and said the promotion gives students an incentive to smoke. 
“We’re all kind of scraping by, 
so if there are smokers, they’d take advantage of it,” she said. by the state.
Baines shared stories of 
religious leaders who re-
fused to marry interracial or 
interfaith couples. 
“That is the freedom of 
religion that I do not agree 
with,” Baines said.
Jenna Goldman, a 21-year-
old political science and his-
tory senior, attended Baines’ speech because she said she 
was interested in the topic. 
“I’m Jewish and was al-
ways the only Jewish kid in 
school, so this has always af-
fected me, especially prayer 
in school and feeling very alienated, so this is some-thing I’ve always been inter-ested in,” Goldman said.
Attendees could ask ques-
tions toward the end of the presentation. 
Kenneth D. Wald, a UF 
professor of political science, 
said Baines did a great job of 
explaining why separation of church and state is good for religious liberty.
“Very many people sort of 
assume if you want to keep religion, you know, out of state you’re somehow hostile toward religion,” Wald said. 
“And I think what he showed 
is if you respect religion, it’s best if it is kept out of the state, preserving the freedom 
of individuals to believe and 
say what they want.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2014

After a nurse contracted Ebola in Dallas, 
the UF community is preparing for a potential 
outbreak.  
The New York Times reported Sunday 
that a nurse at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital was the first person to contract Ebola within the U.S., the second diagnosed and the 
first confirmed case of infection by contagion.
“There is no reason to panic,” said Paul 
Psychas, an assistant professor at the UF East-
side Community Practice.
He said the people most at risk are the 
health care workers.
“Ebola is highly infectious even if someone 
is quite careful,” Psychas said. “Even a slight 
mistake can lead to infection.”
According to The New York Times, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that health officials check the pro-tective gear available to health workers for 
treating Ebola patients and place them into more specialized facilities with containment units.  
Psychas said preparation and protocol 
are key in fighting the virus. He said that UF Health on-campus facilities as well as UF Health Shands Hospital are actively preparing for the possibility of an Ebola case.
“We are taking every step necessary to be 
sure we are ready,” Psychas said. “Drills and trainings are ongoing.”
Nurses, doctors and other health care staff 
are being trained to recognize possible cases 
of Ebola and to check people that have been 
traveling to Dallas and to countries where the virus has traveled. 
UF Ebola study group member Cassidy 
Howell, a 21-year-old international studies senior, said the most important aspect in the fight against Ebola is fighting rumors and the lack of information.
“A lot of uninformed people have begged 
for a travel ban,” she said. “As students we can educate the public about the truths of Eb-ola.”UF prepared if Ebola does spread

ST. LOUIS — Officers arrested 17 
protesters and used pepper spray to 
subdue some of them Sunday in a St. Louis neighborhood not far from the suburb where violence erupted this 
summer after the shooting of a black 
man by a white policeman.
The arrests were the only incident 
in an otherwise peaceful weekend of demonstrations in the city to protest the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Mi-chael Brown in Ferguson in August. The shooting sparked sometimes-vi-olent demonstrations in the predomi-
nantly black suburb.
Early Sunday morning, about 200 
protesters gathered in Shaw, a south 
St. Louis neighborhood where last week another black 18-year-old was killed by a white police officer, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said. The protesters, some wearing masks, marched toward a QuikTrip conve-nience store and tried to force open 
its doors, Dotson said.
Riot police told the crowd to dis-
perse, but about 50 protesters linked 
arms to create a human chain, he said. About half of them heeded the police warning.
“The people who were left there 
were people who made a conscious decision they wanted to be arrested,” 
Dotson said.
At least one officer was hit by a 
rock but was not seriously injured, 
and officers used pepper spray to get those arrested to comply with police, Dotson said. Police were charging those arrested with unlawful assem-bly then releasing them Sunday.Some St. Louis arrests at

A registered sex offender was arrested early 
Monday after police said he falsely identified 
himself while being escorted from 101 Cantina in Midtown.
At about 1:30 a.m., Dennis Richard Mill-
ner, 42, gave officers a false name after being banned from the restaurant and bar, located 
at 1632 W. University Ave. He told officers his 
name was Denny Richard Robinson, but that name came up as a young black man when police looked it up.
Police found Millner’s driver’s license after 
searching him, which confirmed his name and age. Police also discovered Millner had a Tal-
lahassee warrant for leaving town despite be-
ing a registered sex offender.  
He was arrested on his warrant and charges 
of providing a false name to a law enforcement officer. His bond is currently set at $25,000.
A patient at a rehabilitation center was ar-
rested Monday morning after he hit one of the employees in the face with a closed fist. 
Anthony Dwayne Howard was said to be 
acting aggressively toward other patients and staff at Gainesville’s Meridian location, 4300 SW 13th St. A report said the 42-year-old made remarks about wanting to fight someone at the 
center and was seen walking around the area 
with a closed fist.
The victim, a staff tech for the facility who 
was wearing scrubs, was clearing patients from the area. As the victim walked by at about 10 a.m., Howard punched her on the left side of her jaw. She said she had minor pain in her jaw, but did not request medical attention. 
He was arrested on charges of battery and 
his bond had not been set as of press time.

A Gainesville man was arrested Sunday 
after police said he broke into an empty house and stole almost $700 worth of items. 
A woman called police after she returned 
to her apartment and found her back door open after she had been gone for a few days. She said the attic’s ceiling was also open and she noticed many items missing.
When police arrived at the victim’s apart-
ment at 6417 SW Ninth Ave., they saw Joseph Tyree Smith walking out of a connecting apart-
ment two doors down wearing a necklace 
with a heart on it, which the victim reported as being stolen. Smith, 34, told police it was a gift from his girlfriend but later changed his story.
After he was read his rights, Smith told po-
lice his friend — whom he identified to police as 40-year-old Danny Jermyn McClendon — smashed through the next-door apartment’s back window and crawled through the at-
tic space to access the victim’s residence last 
Wednesday at 6 p.m. Smith said McClendon then let him inside of the apartment to move the victim’s belongings back to his place. Po-lice recovered most of the missing items. 
While police were searching Smith, they 
found a small plastic bag with about two grams of marijuana in his right pocket. They also found cigars, which Smith said he used to smoke the marijuana. 
Smith was arrested on charges of burglary 
of an unoccupied dwelling, grand theft, pos-session of less than 20 grams of marijuana and 
possession of drug paraphernalia. His bond is 
currently set at $20,000. 

Police said the two pedestrians hit while at-
tempting to cross the intersection of NW 17th Street and University Avenue in front of the Swamp Restaurant area late Friday will likely be cited for pedestrian violations. 
UF students Christopher D. Olson, 21, and 
Audrey E. Clark, 20, suffered severe, non-life-threatening injuries. The driver, Sonya Wil-liams, 40, had the green light.
Police are awaiting toxicology reports.

TekMatic Corp., a start-
up based out of Miami and 
Gainesville, is batting its way to a home run with the develop-ment of a new training baseball 
bat used by Major League Base-
ball players.
Greg Tekerman was in-
spired to create the bat after Raul Ibanez, a right fielder for the Kansas City Royals, said there was no tool for baseball players to improve their game.
Tekerman then decided to 
create the TekBat in 2012 with the help of his son, Hayden, and Ibanez. 
“Raul tried several proto-
types and helped us get it to what it is now,” said Hayden Tekerman, a 21-year-old UF biological engineering senior. “He sent my dad to Pennsylva-
nia to Chandler Bats where they 
developed the final model.”
The design of the bat shows 
players their strengths and weaknesses whenever they hit the ball.
Without the correct stance 
or placement of hands on the bat, the flight of the ball will not 
be direct, sending it flying up 
or down instead of the straight shot baseball players should aim for.
The handle of the bat was 
developed to be heavier and larger than a regular bat, pre-venting a player from rolling their wrists which can affect the 
way a ball is hit. 
Hayden Tekerman began 
to handle the business from Gainesville as soon as the bat’s 
design became patented and developed.
Twenty-three TekBats have 
been sold, according to the Tek-
Matic Corp. website. One Tek-
Bat costs $120.
Megan Diaz, a 20-year-old

“MLB players have batting 
coaches who are usually re-sponsible for correcting their form and style,” she said. “It’s not always helpful, though, be-cause it implies that the hitter is adopting their coach’s batting form instead of their own.”
Diaz said a batting coach 
would still be helpful, but the bat would give players a more personal training experience.
“The bat would give the 
player time to still develop their technique,” she said. “They’d only need a couple of adjust-ments for improvement.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
VATICAN CITY — Catholic 
bishops signaled a radical shift in 
tone Monday about accepting gays into the church, saying they had gifts to offer and that their partner-
ships, while morally problematic, 
provided homosexual couples with “precious” support.
In a preliminary report — re-
leased halfway through a Vatican meeting on family life called by Pope Francis — the bishops also said the Church must welcome divorcees and recognize the “positive” aspects 
of civil marriages and even Catho-
lics who cohabitate, as well as the children of less-traditional families.
While it does not change Church 
doctrine, the tone of the report on a host of hot-button family issues such as marriage, divorce, homo-sexuality and birth control was one of almost-revolutionary acceptance 
and understanding rather than con-demnation. It will guide a closed-
door debate until a final document 
is issued Saturday.
LGBT rights groups hailed what 
they called a “seismic shift” in the 
Church’s attitude toward gays.
“For the LGBT Catholics in 
the United States and around the world, this new document is a light in the darkness — a dramatic new tone from a church hierarchy that 
has long denied the very existence 
of committed and loving gay and lesbian partnerships,” said Chad Griffin, president of Human Rights Campaign, the biggest LGBT rights organization in the U.S.
Some conservative cardinals 
downplayed the report as insig-nificant or derided it as unaccept-
able, while conservative groups 
denounced it as heresy and a “be-trayal” that will only serve to con-fuse Catholics.
“Confused, contradictory chaos 
in Rome,” headlined the arch-con-servative commentator Michael Vo-ris.
Bishops clearly took into account 
the views of the pope, whose “who am I to judge?” comment about gays signaled a new tone of welcome for the Church.
Their report also reflected the 
views of ordinary Catholics who — in responses to Vatican question-naires in the run-up to the synod — 
rejected Church teaching on birth 
control and homosexuality as out-dated and irrelevant.
In a sign of the chasm that is ap-
parently underway, Pope Francis decided late Friday to add six pro-gressives from four continents to the synod leadership to help prepare the final document after several conser-
vatives were elected to leadership 
positions.
None of the pope’s appointees 
were Africans, who are traditionally among the most conservative on family issues.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgMonday’s question: Are you worried 
about the Snapchat leak? Today’s question: Are you following the search for the 
next UF president?Connections matter: Keep home roots 
When freshmen embark on the ﬁ  rst semester of their college careers, one of three things un-doubtedly occurs: They forget their families 
at home exist, they become incredibly homesick and call them every night or they cheerfully manage to keep up relationships with their families while also balancing and enjoying school like an ultimate pro. Kudos to those who can swing that. We’ve all been through that tough ﬁ  rst break from the comfort of home, whether it’s hardest breaking away from your family, your friends or just your pet. College is always an adjustment period.
Personally, when I ﬁ  rst arrived at UF, I became a sob-
bing homesick mess and called my mom every other night. I holed up in my bed like a gnome afraid of sunlight and new college experiences. This feeling of intense homesick-ness was really new for me because I’d been away from home before — often for long periods. The year before, I’d traveled halfway across the world for two months without batting an eyelash or crying a single homesick tear. But when I was living only four hours away from home at UF … bring on the waterworks.
Of course, this changed as I got used to college, got in-
volved and made new friends. I’d like to let anybody who is suffering from homesickness now know this — it does get easier, and it does change. For me, it changed so much that by the middle of this semester, with a full course load and a mountain of extra things to do which hungrily eat up my time and energy, I am only calling my family and friends at home perhaps once every three weeks.
Unfortunately, this isn’t actually healthier than becom-
ing a homesick gnome. My family is tightly knit. I have two wonderful sisters that I’d like to remain close with for rest of my life. It’s important to me to keep up that connec-tion, and in college it’s easy to forget how much time has passed. It’s easy to miss how much might have changed in the lives of those you love when suddenly you don’t speak to them every day.Whether it’s family, friends, 
a partner, an organization you were part of or your loyal and lovable puppy, we all have things and people special to us that we’ve left behind to come here to UF and shape our futures. This is true if you hail from across the country, overseas or only 30 min-
utes from Gainesville.
Sometimes, when the haze of homesickness has lifted 
and we feel comfortable in our place and with our goals, we can lose sight of the relationships and the bonds we forged for the ﬁ  rst 18 years of our lives.
Recently, I came across an article in the New York Times 
titled “Forty Portraits in Forty Years” written by Susan Mi-not. The article is about a photography project by Nicholas Nixon made up of 40 different photographs of four sisters taken every year spanning from 1975 to present day. The article was well written, but the portraits were especially enthralling. The photographs illustrate the closeness the sisters have maintained their whole lives, but they also tell the reader a story about the human condition — connec-tions to other people are important and worth safeguard-ing. In every picture, the sisters age, but their relationships with each other never seem to fade.
In college, selﬁ  shly wrapped up in our own problems 
and activities, we can forget to nurture the relationships we’ve formed with loved ones in the past, often because we are so busy building networks with new people. Some-times, we — myself included — need a reminder to trea-sure and maintain these bonds. We should make an ef-fort not to forget about the connections we’ve made with important people in our lives and remember that every relationship we create can be meaningful.

inspire veteran 
commitment
This week in Washington, D.C., a new memorial honoring 
disabled veterans opened to the public. According to the Sun Sentinel, the memorial was funded by Florida heir-
ess Lois Pope, who raised “$80 million, including some of her National Enquirer fortune.” The donations included $3 million 
from former presidential candidate Ross Perot and $270,000 
from the Florida Disabled American Veterans.
Pope’s visits to hospitals treating wounded soldiers inspired 
her efforts to create the new memorial.
“I’m not going to stop ﬁ  ghting for their rights,” Pope said. 
“I believe this memorial is a call to action to give them the best medical care they need and deserve.”
There are more than four million wounded veterans in the 
U.S., and more than 100,000 of them live in Florida.
During the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, car 
decals reading “Support Our Troops” were a popular sight. Un-fortunately, those words of support ring hollow today, as our country has failed miserably to attend to the needs of veterans returning from those wars.
The Department of Veterans Affairs is riddled with inefﬁ  cien-
cies and incompetence, both at the national level and in Florida.
Here in Gainesville, the disastrous scandals at the Malcom 
Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center serve as a potent re-
minder of America’s shortcomings in veteran health care.
In June, three mental health care administrators were sus-
pended after the discovery of a secret list containing more than 
200 patients waiting for treatment. The Gainesville Sun reported that wait times at Randall are among the worst in the nation at an average of 50.8 days for new patients.
The abysmal state of health care for Florida veterans was re-
vealed in the wake of a national VA scandal that began after at least 35 veterans died while waiting for health care treatment in 
Phoenix, Arizona. The scandal, which ultimately led to resigna-
tion of Veterans Affairs secretary Gen. Eric Shinseki, led to an examination of VA systems around the country.
“The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” brought attention to 
the failings of the VA with a segment focusing on its outdated technology. Many of the VA’s computer systems have not been updated since the 1980s, leading to miscommunications, lost re-cords and lengthy waiting lists.
Perhaps someday, our country will eventually stop sending 
our young men and women off to be injured, disabled and killed in foreign wars. Until that day comes, we have an obligation to ensure that our veterans are treated properly and with respect.
Rather than continuing to pour billions of dollars into the cof-
fers of private defense contractors, Congress should redirect that money toward ensuring that our disabled veterans receive the best health care we can provide.
Rather than simply repeating the worn out trope of “Support 
Our Troops,” it is time for America to back up those words with action by providing our veterans with a high-quality, fully-func-tional health care system.

The Drug Enforcement Administration 
has frequently displayed reckless disre-gard for the lives of any person associ-
ated with drugs. The agency’s thoughtless be-havior recently reached a new low.
According to reports released last week, a 
DEA agent created a fake Facebook proﬁ  le and impersonated a young single mother who was awaiting sentencing for drug charges. In addi-tion to posting personal photos of the woman, which he obtained from her cell phone, he also communicated with her friends and acquain-tances, sent a friend request to a fugitive and created false status updates — all without her 
knowledge.
A U.S. attorney defended the agent’s ac-
tions as serving a “legitimate law enforcement 
purpose.”
These actions point to a disturbing cycle of 
dehumanization in the war on drugs, especial-ly in our country. For decades, the U.S. govern-ment has treated nonviolent drug offenders as though they are less than human beings.
Instead of treatment and education, they 
receive aggressive and terrifying SWAT raids, indeﬁ  nite seizures of property, and extremely harsh prison sen-tences. Their privacy is disre-spected, their safety is compro-mised and the value of their lives 
is treated with indifference. What 
good has come out of it?
Treating drug abuse as a crim-
inal justice issue instead of a pub-lic health issue has resulted in increased drug-related violence, the establishment of billion-dol-lar drug cartels and a staggering incarceration rate that continues to rise.
Even though American taxpayers have 
spent an overwhelming $1 trillion over the past four decades on the war on drugs, our prisons are bursting with nonviolent drug of-fenders. This isn’t surprising, considering that the DEA’s very existence relies upon the con-stant process of arrests and convictions.
Irrationally labeling drug abuse as a crimi-
nal problem is the reason why the U.S. makes 
up only 5 percent of the world’s population 
but holds almost 25 percent of the world’s prisoners. According to the Fed-eral Bureau of Prisons, about half of federal prisoners are serving drug-related sentences. U.S. pol-icy makers desperately need to 
admit that the current drug poli-
cies are doing much more harm than good.
To truly curb drug abuse 
and help addicts, the U.S. gov-ernment should follow a model that is proven to have positive 
effects. 
Thirteen years ago, Portugal suffered from 
troubling drug abuse and addiction problems in its communities.Instead of pumping money into criminal investigations and prisons, Por-tugal’s government made the controversial decision to decriminalize all drugs and es-tablish policies and programs for prevention, treatment and harm reduction.
Drug possession is still prohibited but 
treated as a civil offense, much like a parking 
violation. People found with small amounts 
of drugs are sent to appear in front of a spe-cial commission, which analyzes each case and makes recommendations for treatment or non-criminal penalties. Health practitioners are heavily involved in the decision.
The results are incredible. Youth drug use 
has decreased, overdose rates have fallen, and more addicts are seeking treatment than ever before. Without the fear of being thrown in prison, people struggling with drug abuse are coming forward to receive help.
The war on drugs has failed, but it does 
not have to stay a failure. As demonstrated by Portugal’s success, education and health pro-grams will go a long way in effectively low-
ering rates of drug abuse and the crimes that 
come with it.
In order to see the improvements these 
new policies will bring to our society, the U.S. government must confront its own addiction to incarceration. Otherwise, the cycle of drug abuse, violence and imprisonment will con-tinue indeﬁ  nitely.

As representatives for UF’s 4,000 graduate assis-
tants, we received last Monday’s presidential search update with great concern.
Not only have UF administrators failed to ad-
equately include graduate assistant representation at 
any step of this week’s three-day selection process, 
they actually seem to have no interest in including graduate assistants in the vetting of UF’s next presi-dent at all.
We ﬁ  nd it highly suspect, quoting from the commit-
tee’s latest report, that “after ﬁ  ve months of search com-
mittee and subcommittee meetings and outreach to the greater UF community,” Graduate Assistants United has not been contacted once throughout the process.
Given our recent efforts at increasing transparency 
at UF, such disregard for the largest percentage of the university’s workforce — particularly at the levels of research and teaching — reﬂ  ects not on the candidates 
but on the leadership at the helm of the Presidential 
Search Committee.
However, as United Faculty of Florida representa-
tive Paul Ortiz aptly pointed out: “Students, faculty and the broader community should be involved in ev-ery step of this process because all of these constituen-cies will be affected by this decision. The days when university administrations were ivory towers, isolated from their surrounding communities, are long gone.”
Yet current developments beg the question — does 
an ivory tower still stand in Gainesville?GAU has demanded greater 
transparency within the selec-tion process, receiving so far a tepid response from Search Committee ofﬁ  cials. Not only 
does this week’s schedule es-
sentially cram the exposure time that candidates will 
have with the UF community at the end of a terse and obscure review process, it also conﬁ  rms what we fear is an encroaching reality — the next UF president is not expected to know about or hear from the university’s graduate assistants.
We ask all candidates on the search committee’s 
shortlist to right the wrongs created by this whirlwind 
search and seriously consider the following questions: 
Will you make the time to meet with members of the graduate assistant community and their legal labor representatives, GAU?
Moreover, as the next president of UF, will you 
continue to make us pay to work by charging us up to $2,000 annually in fees? Do you ﬁ  nd it acceptable that many graduate assistants are forced below the poverty line by having to pay fees back to our employer?
We eagerly look forward to each of the candidates’ 
answers to these questions. And we sincerely hope GAU and the incoming president are able to work to-gether to help remove the many obstacles graduate as-sistants have faced over the last few years.

This summer, while 
working for a startup in Tel Aviv, I took a week-
end to travel to Jerusalem and visit the Holocaust memo-
rial. There, I walked by black 
and white photos of charred synagogues, Jewish-owned storefronts with shattered windows and signs calling for boycotts of Jewish businesses.
I found it oddly reminis-
cent of earlier that day, when I was reading news headlines 
about people hurling Molo-
tov cocktails at synagogues in Paris and burning Israeli ﬂ  ags while conﬁ  dently roar-ing “death to the Jews!”
This past week, anti-Semi-
tism hit closer to home when a Jewish fraternity house at Emory University in Atlanta 
was vandalized with swas-
tikas. This act was not only offensive, naive and spiteful, but extremely terrifying. It seems that as much as we try to teach each generation to “never forget” the Holocaust, there are those who blatantly undermine the bitter history 
behind a swastika and its 
meaning to six million Jews, as well as millions of homo-sexuals, Africans, people with disabilities, Christian activists and Gypsies.
There is absolutely no ex-
cuse for anti-Semitism in the present day, yet it continues 
under the misguided veil of 
anti-Israel sentiment. Who-ever draws an analogy of the political situation in Israel to Nazi Germany is shamefully ignorant. It’s OK to be critical of Israeli political policy — in fact, Israel encourages open discussion and moral debate. 
It’s OK to criticize Israel just as one would criticize other na-tions for their faults. It is when 
one deliberately singles out and criticizes the Jewish na-tion or the Jewish people that they embody anti-Semitism.
Why does the United Na-
tions constantly condemn Israel for perceived human rights abuses when ﬂ  agrant 
abuses on signiﬁ  cantly larger 
scales go without mention in countries like Cuba, Sudan, China and Iran? This is anti-Semitism.
Why is it that it’s now the 
21st century and yet, an Em-ory Jewish fraternity house is vandalized with a swastika, 
the preeminent symbol of ha-
tred and bigotry? This is anti-Semitism.
Why is it that if you walk 
through the 13th Street tun-nel on the UF campus, you see grafﬁ  ti of anti-Israel slogans paired with swastikas? This is anti-Semitism.
Anti-Semitism takes many 
forms, and it is shameful that many facets of the prejudice — whose long history dates back to signiﬁ  cant events like the ﬁ  rst Crusade in 1096, the Jew-ish expulsion from England in 1290, the Spanish Inquisi-tion in 1492, the Holocaust in 
Europe and the riots in Paris 
— continue to this day. This should no longer be a part of our daily lives; we must main-tain the promise to “never forget” and relegate hatred to history books and black and white photos.

UF’s Department of Urban 
and Regional Planning grad-
uate program was ranked the 
14th best out of all graduate 
urban planning programs.
This new ranking puts the 
department in the College 
of Design, Construction and 
Planning three spots above its 2012 ranking and next to schools like the Massachu-setts Institute of Technol-
ogy and Harvard University. 
The graduate program also placed first in the Southeast-ern Conference.
“We’re up there in the 
big leagues, and we want to stay in the big leagues,” said Christopher Silver, dean of the college.
The list was published 
by Planetizen, a source for urban planning news, edi-torials and jobs. The publi-
cation’s Guide to Graduate 
Urban Planning Programs surveyed 97 schools with urban planning master’s de-grees and considered factors 
such as grade point averag-
es, faculty publications and opinion surveys.
Kristin Larsen, director of 
the School of Landscape Ar-chitecture and Planning, said the publication is the only one that ranks solely gradu-ate planning programs and is the go-to publication for students.
“It’s important because 
faculty at other universities look at these rankings, and they pay attention to these 
rankings,” Larsen said. “It’s 
a way for us to compare our program and strengthen it further.”  
According to Larsen, the 
department has 13 faculty members and about 122 stu-dents. It’s the first graduate planning program in U.S. to 
have a fully online master’s 
degree, which was estab-lished in 2012. Larsen said the online component might be a reason the school has 
gained recognition.
“This definitely helps 
draw students in,” she said.
The Department of Urban 
and Regional Planning cel-
ebrated its 40th anniversary last Thursday.
Silver said the rankings 
help recruit new students 
and keep alumni proud. The 
school is gaining recogni-tion because of the quality of research, publications and 
students that come out of the 
school, he said.
“Part of it is being produc-
tive but also highly visible among those who answer the 
questionnaire and identify 
which programs are the best in the country,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2014

� SEVEN HIGH SCHOOLERS 
WERE ARRESTED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
PARLIN, N.J. — As classes re-
sumed in a New Jersey town Mon-
day for the first time since the arrest of seven high school football play-ers on charges of sexually abus-
ing younger teammates, attention 
turned to whether the state’s anti-bullying laws adequately address team sports.
Seven members of the celebrated 
Sayreville War Memorial High team were charged Friday over behavior that allegedly occurred during a 10-day period last month.
Advocates say New Jersey, 
which passed an anti-bullying law in 2002 and has added to it since then, is among the leaders nation-wide in dealing with the problem. But the laws do not specifically ad-
dress sports teams.
Acting state education Commis-
sioner David Hespe said the allega-
tions have prompted a review.
“We do see this as an opportu-
nity to provide guidance and to take a fresh look at how school districts have ... been responding to hazing and bullying,” he said. He also said 
it is an opportunity to see what “ad-
ditional best practices” can be put in place.
State Sen. Joseph Vitale and 
Assemblyman John Wisniewski, whose districts include Sayreville, cautioned against rushing to make changes before all the facts are known.
“The natural question is who 
was supervising these students so that that can’t happen. We don’t know that right now,” Wisniewski said. “Before we talk about the need to legislate, we should first discuss all the facts, and we don’t have all 
the facts.”
The state’s high school sports 
governing body, in its constitution, 
encourages schools to establish rules on hazing, and schools are also obli-gated under state law to have anti-bullying procedures. Sayreville’s 
17-page anti-bullying policy doesn’t 
mention the words “athletics,” ‘’sports” or “coaches.”
Steve Timko, executive director of 
the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletics Association, said the orga-nization is going to review its rules on hazing and expand its education 
programs addressing the issue.
Sayreville Superintendent Rich-
ard Labbe, who canceled the rest of 
the school’s football season last week over the allegations, and School Board President Kevin Ciak didn’t return calls for comment Monday. 
Labbe has said he is weighing 
the future of the football program, 
which has won three sectional titles 
in four years and is the pride of Say-reville, a community of about 40,000 people 25 miles southwest of New York City.
“I will say clearly: Whether we 
have a football program moving forward is certainly a question in my mind,” he told NJ.com. “Based 
upon the severity of the charges, I’m 
not sure.”
Three of the students were 
charged with aggravated sexual as-sault, hazing and other crimes stem-ming from an act of sexual penetra-tion against a team member. The 
four other students were charged 
with aggravated criminal sexual contact and other offenses.
All seven have been suspended. 
None have been identified because they are minors.
It isn’t known whether coaches 
at Sayreville knew about the alleged abuse or suspected it was going on.
While many strongly criticized 
Labbe’s decision to cancel the season last week, the reaction on Monday was more sober.
“It just kind a puts a real damper 
on your view of your town,” said Angelo Palma, a 2006 Sayreville graduate. “And your leaders, your teachers, your school. Thinking, 
wow, I thought I lived in a great 
town that people really loved each other, cared for each other. And this just shows a lack of care and concern for our neighbors.”

UF beekeepers are awaiting leg-
islation that could bring a $3.5 mil-
lion bee research facility to campus.
Gov. Rick Scott vetoed UF’s 
proposal for a $2.5 million grant to 
build a beekeeping research facil-
ity in 2013. But UF and the Florida State Beekeepers Association are in the process of regrouping in order to lobby for their cause.
Laurence Cutts, a self-professed 
Florida bee advocate, said the facil-ity has plenty of support within the beekeeping community.
The original $2.5 million vetoed 
in 2013 would have gone toward building the facility. With the pro-posed $3.5 million, the plans include an adjoining auditorium and teach-ing facility.Cutts said UF already has archi-
tectural plans for the facility and is strategizing to go back to the legisla-ture to get the proposal approved.
Florida TaxWatch, a private 
company that closely monitors how taxpayer money is spent, compiled 
a report on the facility this year. The 
report said the facility would pay for itself and bring in an extra $1 million in profits the first year alone. The addition of the facility to UF would make Florida one of the top beekeeping research facilities in the world, Cutts said. 
Tom Nolan, president of the Flor-
ida State Beekeepers Association, said the legislative effort is being be-ing spearheaded by the association.  
“We are going back to the leg-
islature and we will make a better charge at the governor’s office no matter who is in the governor’s seat this year,” Nolan said.
Cutts said UF has received so 
much attention in the beekeeping community for its leadership and passion brought by James Ellis, a UF associate professor of entomology. 
Lobbying for the funds to build 
the new facility has already started among beekeepers and their local government. The association hired a lobbyist in 2014 and will resubmit a proposal by the end of this year.
Though beekeeping is not the 
focal point of the university, Cutts said that the benefits of the new fa-cility would reach beyond UF to the 
whole U.S.
If the proposal is approved and 
the grant is received, Cutts said he 
foresees that the new lab will be built within two years.
“We are going to keep lobbying 
until we get it,” Cutts said.

Before Bryan Dubno graduated 
from UF, he created an application 
for The Gator Nation.
The computer science alumnus 
developed the original UFmobile app, which he said could reach about 36,000 users daily.“But I ran into legal trouble 
with the university and had to take 
it down,” he said.
Now, a UF-sponsored app 
stands in its place.
Dubno’s original UFmobile app 
sparked his interest in app creation 
and has led to his latest endeavor 
— Kiwi.
Just two weeks after Kiwi was released, the phone personaliza-tion app had been downloaded 
more than 1.1 million times. 
The app allows users to create a 
custom keyboard with color back-grounds and images from photo libraries, which users can then ap-ply gradient and blur effects to.
“It gives people a way to make 
their phone their own,” Dubno said. “It’s sort of like opening your computer and seeing a picture that makes you happy.”About 200 fonts are avail-
able for keyboard use on the app, Dubno said. Kiwi also allows iOS 8 users to share the keyboards they 
create with a link for other people to download and use, he said. 
Dubno started working on the 
app in July, and it was released 
Sept. 17.
Travis Noddings, a 20-year-old 
UF English junior, said he down-loaded the app as soon as it was released.
“I think the app is awesome — 
instead of just having a custom pic-ture on your lock screen or home screen, you can have something personal on your keyboard.” UF alumnus develops smartphone personalization app

Authorities say a 9-year-old 
boy drowned while at a birth-day party in the Fort Lauderdale suburb Southwest Ranches.
Police said the boy was 
spotted at the bottom of the pool Sunday evening. He was pronounced dead at Memorial Hospital West.
The child did not live at the 
home. It was unclear how long he was at the bottom of the pool.In other Florida newsIt changes the keyboard“It’s sort of like opening

Jeff Driskel is the Gators’ start-
ing quarterback as of right now, 
but fans will get another glimpse of what true freshman Treon Harris has to offer when Florida takes on Missouri on Saturday night. 
Coach Will Muschamp an-
nounced Monday afternoon that both quarterbacks will take snaps against the Tigers.
“Right now Jeff will probably start,” the fourth-year head coach said, “but they’re both going to play.” 
Harris’ last time out was on the 
road against Tennessee, where he came in late in the third quarter for Driskel and completed two of four 
passes good for 17 yards and added 
25 rushing yards on seven carries.
The Miami native is back on the 
team after missing a week of prac-tice while being investigated for alleged sexual battery. Muschamp 
said that missing a week as a true 
freshman may affect him more then it would an upperclassman, but he has an impressive playmaking ability that didn’t go unnoticed in practice. 
“You take the ball in the right 
spots, accurate with his passes, has a certain confidence about him. I 
think that’s been something I’ve 
seen and noticed throughout his opportunities, though limited in game.” Muschamp said. 
Harris, the No. 3 ranked dual-
threat prospect in the 2014 recruit-ing class rankings, stepped on campus in August after a recruiting process in which he was highly re-
cruited by Florida, Auburn and Mi-
ami — the school closest to his high school Booker T. Washington. 
Harris passed for more than 
2,000 yards and 24 touchdowns as a senior at Booker T. while throwing only four interceptions.
“He’s got a certain persona 
about himself,” Muschamp said. 
“That’s why in his last two years 
at Booker T. he was 30-0. That tells

Late in Florida’s 30-27 
loss to LSU Saturday night, 
a silence enveloped the more 
than 88,000 fans in atten-
dance. 
Receiver Latroy Pittman 
lay motionless on the turf, 
being tended to by trainers. 
Much of the LSU team took to a knee, some could be seen praying, but most of Florida’s team seemed to be huddling, 
talking through what they 
were about to do on the next series.
Muschamp said Pittman 
was going to be all right after the game, and Sunday morn-ing UF released a statement that Pittman was released from the hospital Saturday 
night.
But Florida fan Kyle Mor-
gan took to Facebook in a rant 
about the sequence of events 
and it was picked up by the 
New Orleans Times-Picayune among his ravings included:
“Fire Will Muschamp, Jer-
emy Foley. If not for being a 
bad head coach who can’t win 
enough games, then do it for the better reason. Fire him for failing to be a leader of men. Fire him because he lacks the respect for an injured player 
that over 80,000 other people 
possessed in that stadium.”
Monday, Muschamp fired 
back at allegations that he was callous in the wake of 
what seemed like a serious 
injury at the time.
“Well, the information is 
relayed to me immediately 
that he had movement,” Mus-
champ said. 
“We took that time, and 
we’ve not instructed our players to take a knee in those 
situations, any time someone 
gets hurt, we don’t always know the severity of the inju-ry or the situation. That’s not 
something that we’ve done, 
or anywhere that I’ve ever been that we’ve ever done.”
Muschamp said they had 
plays to go over for the next 
series including a potential 
field goal block situation. 
Muschamp did end up 
going over to where Pittman 
was laying near the middle of 
the field, and said the receiv-er told him while still on the ground that he was fine. Pitt-man is officially day-to-day.

In a perfect world, freshmen would be good 
enough to start as soon as they enter college.
But this is not a perfect world.
On Friday, No. 8 Florida (12-3, 6-0 South-
eastern Conference) debuted an unfamiliar 
face from its roster against unranked Georgia 
(9-7, 1-3 SEC).
Freshman defensive specialist Sam Dubiel received her opportunity to see some time on the court over the weekend – the first of the freshman defensive specialists to experience game time.
Dubiel started her career after subbing in 
during the second set against Georgia. She 
played the back row with seniors Maddy 
Monserez and Holly Pole, but did not record any digs, blocks or serves.
But on Sunday, she had the opportunity 
to make a difference in the game, playing in her second set of her second match of the sea-son against then-No.19 Texas A&M (11-5, 3-2 SEC).
“Sam, a freshman who had not gotten play-
ing time,” coach Mary Wise said. “… She had 
strained an abdominal muscle which didn’t al-low her to serve at all and so she’s fine-tuning 
her serve in terms of maybe less speed on it but real high accuracy.”
The defensive specialist subbed in for the 
final three plays in the first set and showed off her biggest asset: her float serve.
All season, Wise has said Dubiel’s float 
serve is one of the best on the team – if not the best she has ever seen.
“She’s just getting better and better at prac-Freshman defensive specialist showcases float serve“He’s got a certain

AIR JORDAN
Florida (3-2, 2-2 Southeastern 
Conference) can still very well win the SEC East and 
make it to the conference champi-onship in Atlanta for the ﬁ  rst time 
since 2009. They have four SEC 
matchups remaining on the sched-ule — all of which are against Eastern Division rivals. The ﬁ  rst of those games is against Missouri (4-2, 1-1 SEC) on Saturday night in the Swamp at 7. Here are four points to watch out for when the Gators face their second set of Tigers in as many weeks.
1. Florida’s two-quarterback system: 
Coach Will Muschamp announced in his weekly Monday press conference that both Jeff Driskel and Treon Harris will receive playing time against Missouri on Saturday, with Driskel likely to get the start.
There is an old adage in the football 
world that goes “If you have two starting quarterbacks, you don’t have one.”
In many cases, that tends to be true.But offensive coordinator Kurt Roper has 
experience with a two-quarterback system.
In his last year as the offensive coordi-
nator at Duke, Roper’s starting quarter-back situation consisted of a combination of Anthony Boone and Bran-don Connette. The duo totaled 3,472 passing yards and 26 touchdowns.
Connette worked as the 
main running quarterback, scoring 14 touchdowns on the ground in 2013.
Roper and Muschamp both 
said earlier in the season they would only resort to a dual-
quarterback system this season if there was a purpose for it.
They didn’t feel that it was necessary 
through the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games of the season.
Apparently it is now.2. Mauk’s second game against the 
Gators: Florida learned Maty Mauk’s name early in its matchup against Missouri in 2013.
The then-redshirt freshman quarterback 
started his ﬁ  rst career game against the Gators last season.
His ﬁ  rst pass attempt — and the ﬁ  rst 
play of the game — was a 41-yard pass to L’Damian Washington. One play later, Mauk found receiver Bud Sasser in the end-zone for a touchdown just 27 seconds into the contest.Mauk ﬁ  nished the game with 295 pass-
ing yards, a touchdown and an interception on a 50-percent completion rate. Four dif-ferent receivers had at least three receptions and 52 yards.
In his ﬁ  rst full year as a starter, Mauk has 
stayed relatively consistent, averaging 201.2 passing yards a game and totaling 14 touch-downs on the season, which is tied for third in the SEC.
Mauk experienced some growing pains 
as last weekend against Georgia — throw-ing four interceptions and tallying just 97 yards through the air.
But that just gives him more fuel to tear 
apart Florida’s secondary that’s given up eight passes of at least 30 yards this season.
3. Battle in the trenches: Both Florida 
and Missouri have defensive lines capable of forcing pressure on the opposing quar-terback. 
The Gators have tallied 10 sacks in the 
last two games after totaling just six through 
their ﬁ  rst three games. Redshirt sophomore 
Alex McCalister leads Florida and is ﬁ  fth in the SEC with four sacks — including three in the last three games — and Buck line-backer Dante Fowler Jr. has a team-high nine quarterback hurries.On the opposite side of the line, Florida’s 
offensive line has limited its opponents to an average of one sack per game, which is tied for second in the conference and tied for 16th in the country.
But that number could change if Mis-
souri’s pass rush continues the strong pace it’s created through the ﬁ  rst half of the sea-son. 
The Tigers have 20 sacks through six 
games and are led in the pass rush by junior defensive end Shane Ray and senior Markus Golden, who have 11 of those sacks.
4. Moving the chains:  After converting 
seven third downs in its win against Ten-nessee, Florida struggled to move the chains on Saturday against LSU.
The Gators converted just two of its 12 
third-down attempts against the Tigers.
While Muschamp and Roper want to uti-
lize the up-tempo offense that Roper was brought in to coach, that type of system is impossible to do when the offense can’t 
even stay on the ﬁ  eld.
Luckily for Florida, Missouri is allowing 
opponents to convert on 37.5 percent of its 
third down attempts, so this could (read: should) be the time for Florida to ﬁ  nd its rhythm on offense.
Four talking points for the Florida-Missouri game
Four talking points for the Florida-Missouri game

twitter: @J_McPherson1126him to sit the entire second half, but the plan is to 
have him back Wednesday. 
Offensive lineman D.J. Humphries is expected 
back Wednesday after a knee injury and cornerback Vernon Hargreaves is expected back today after a head injury suffered in the LSU game.
Wide receivers: With a quarterback position in 
turmoil, Florida needs all the help it can get in the passing game, but it isn’t getting it from wide re-ceivers that continue to drop passes.
“Nobody can catch it for them,” Muschamp said. 
“They’ve got to catch the ball. We work on JUGS (machines), we work on any hand-eye, lot of that. (Wide receivers coach Chris Leak) can’t catch it for 
them.” 
Muschamp explained that offensive coordinator 
Kurt Roper holds complete control over the pass-
ing game at Florida, something he insisted on in the interview process and something consistent with 
most college football programs.
“You drop passes, that’s normal,” safety Keanu 
Neal said. “You’re not going to catch every pass that 
comes to you. So yeah they drop passes in practices. 
Yeah, they’ve missed a few in the game, but they’ll 
get it fixed.”tice,” Wise said. “We think as the 
season goes on, there’s going to be a role for her. In January she’s going to be one of three (defensive special-ists). Those three that return, they gotta be ready come January to take over, and they will be. But we really like the future of Sam.”
The freshman’s lack of playing 
time worked in favor for Florida on Sunday. Had Dubiel played or served in matches prior to Friday’s matchup against Georgia, A&M would have been able to scout her serve and find a way to defend against it.
While she only made three plays 
on three serves, she became the 
Gators’ biggest weapon at the end of 
the first set against the Aggies, tak-ing the serve for set-point in a 25-12 set win. 
“From a player standpoint, to be 
an aggressive server you’re going to make some service errors, so there’s a risk-reward,” Wise said. “… The beauty of the player like Sam’s serve 
or Maddy’s, the players that can 
serve the float serve it’s a different look. You know we have the spin servers -- they can bring some heat -- and to be able to combine that with 
the float serves then teams have to 
prepare for both.”
While Wise said Dubiel and fel-
low freshman defensive specialist 
Lindsey Rogers will be taking on a larger role in the spring, it’s hard to deny the athleticism in Dubiel.
As a senior she recorded 607 digs 
and received 563 serves playing as the libero for the 3A state champion team.you something about him. 
He’s a winner.”
Sophomore Keanu Neal, 
who started at safety for Flor-ida against LSU, had high 
praise for the true freshman 
too, especially regarding Har-ris’ play against Tennessee ten days ago.
“He’s just comfortable in 
the pocket,” Neal said. “He didn’t really panic when things went wrong. He almost threw an interception and he didn’t 
panic and he stayed in and did 
a great job in the Tennessee game.”
Driskel, the presumed start-
er, is coming off of an average performance against LSU. 
He completed more than 50 
percent of his passes, but threw two interceptions and fumbled 
the ball in the first quarter. 
Driskel spoke to reporters 
on Monday and was a class act 
behind the podium, even when he was asked repeatedly about whether or not Harris sharing snaps with him would rattle his confidence. 
“Believe it or not, I’m not 
worried about me, I’m wor-ried about the team,” the red-shirt junior signal caller said. “I want the team to play well. If it’s going to help the team, I’m all for it. We’re confident 
in Treon. I think the guys are 
confident in me as well. It’s not going to be something that’s going to divide the team or anything like that.”
Offensive coordinator Kurt 
Roper implemented more quarterback designed runs than fans have seen this sea-
son. 
Driskel ran the ball effec-
tively against LSU, picking 
up 71 yards on 21 carries, in-cluding a touchdown. Driskel said running the football well doesn’t change his confidence level much during games, and added that despite his regres-
sion throughout the season he 
remains just as confident in his abilities as before the season began. 
“Just because I haven’t 
made all the plays I would’ve liked to doesn’t mean I’m not confident,” Driskel said. “I’m still confident in my ability, 
what I can do and what I can 
do for this team. I don’t think my confidence has ever been shaken.”TUESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Some say that winning is all 
that matters. Others say it’s all 
about having fun. Luckily, for 
Florida, it doesn’t have to choose. 
It has both.
The No. 5 Gators are rolling 
through their conference sched-
ule as their season begins to wrap 
up, with five games remaining. 
Florida is 6-0 in Southeastern 
Conference play — the only SEC team without a conference loss — 
and 11-2 on the season.
And the Gators are loving ev-
ery minute of it.
“It’s really hard to believe 
that there’s only five games left,” 
coach Becky Burleigh said. “I think that’s a credit to the fact that every day it’s been really en-joyable.”
Burleigh said on Monday how 
tightly knit Florida team has be-come and how well they have been able to practice and play to-
gether week in and week out.
A big key to Florida’s success 
this year has also been the large 
amount of players who returned from last year’s squad. 
For every player that played 
together last year, they know each other very well -- both on and off the field -- which makes 
playing together this year that 
much easier.
Florida has eight seniors this 
season and 19 total players who returned from last year’s team.  
The Gators have only grown 
stronger in 2014, with eight se-nior players who are familiar with each other’s strengths and weaknesses.
“We knew all along this was 
gonna be kind of a special group because of the large senior class and because of it being a pret-ty intact team from last year’s group,” Burleigh said.
The Gators are firing on all cyl-
inders. They haven’t lost a match since Sept. 12 and they continue to beat their opponents with 
strong goal scorers and tough de-fense.
But Burleigh said she still be-
lieves Florida can improve and 
continue to develop as a team. 
She thinks individual players, 
younger ones who have not been exposed as much, will become important playmakers as they continue to get better.
“I think this team still has 
room to grow,” Burleigh said. “We’re seeing different players emerge…and I think we’re gon-
na continue to see more players emerge.”
Betsy Middleton was one play-
er Burleigh used as an example. 
The sophomore transfer from 
the University of Miami has seen 
improvement as the season has gone on. Middleton is third on the team with three goals this season 
and has yet to start a game.
If Florida continues to get 
stronger as the postseason quick-
ly approaches, it wouldn’t be a 
surprise to see it in the NCAA 
Championships in late Novem-ber.
“For us, I think the sky’s still 
the limit,” Burleigh said.
