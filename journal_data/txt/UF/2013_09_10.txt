UF may be a wet campus, but 
Norman Hall has run dry.
All bathrooms, sinks and water 
fountains in “old” Norman Hall have 
been out of order since a water main pipe malfunctioned two weeks ago.
Workers are still uncertain of what 
happened to the pipe because it runs beneath the building. Project man-ager Chandler Rozear said he hopes water will be restored Friday.
Employees arrived in the new In-
formation Technology department housed in the Norman Hall base-ment Aug. 26 to ﬁ  nd a 1-inch ﬂ  ood. After pieces of the carpet and drywall 
were removed, workers found water 
bubbling. Nearly 100 gallons a day 
bubbled from a 5-foot-tall leak.
The department just completed its 
renovation in June, and expensive-equipment was relocated to be sal-vaged from potential mold. Rozear 
said the department will need new 
carpet tiles, drywall and paint, a rela-
tively cheap ﬁ  x, and will be ready in two to three weeks.
Workers tested the water and 
found chlorine present, which meant 
the water came from reclaimed ir-
rigation water or drinking water. After turning off the water main to VOLUME 108 ISSUE 14 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2013

UF is inching toward top 10 status.
The university is up three spots to No. 14 on the U.S. 
News & World Report’s 2014 list of “The Top 30 Public 
National Universities,” which was released today. 
UF tied for the 49th spot overall with Northeastern Uni-
versity and the University of California, Irvine. It was 54th 
last year.
“University faculty, staff, students and supporters 
helped pull UF through ﬁ  ve difﬁ  cult years of a down na-tional economy and state budget cuts,” Provost Joseph Glover said in a news release. “UF’s national ranking is in large part due to their efforts and reﬂ  ects our contin-
ued quest to increase our standing among the nation’s top 
public universities.”
Among UF’s improvements was its percentage of class-
es with fewer than 20 students — which was 45, and now it’s 49.
But UF administrators know the university needs to in-
crease its faculty resources, which are ranked 102nd.
UF is using state funds to do just that. Florida Gov. Rick 
Scott signed a preeminence bill into law in the Spring that provides $15 million annually for ﬁ  ve years to help UF 
achieve top 10 status. UF will match that through private 
fundraising.
“This will beneﬁ  t all students in Florida who deserve 
an opportunity to attend a top-ranked university in their home state,” UF President Bernie Machen said in the re-
lease.
The University of Miami (No. 47) was the only Florida 
university to beat UF on the overall list. Florida State Uni-
versity came in at 91. The University of Central Florida 
and the University of South Florida tied for No. 170.UF ranked No. 14,

� E-CIGARETTES OFTEN CONTAIN 
NICOTINE IN SMALLER DOSES.
ALEX HARRIS and
BROOKE BAITINGER

Electronic cigarette usage has doubled 
among American middle and high school stu-
dents in the past year, and some local experts and young e-cigarette users are butting heads about the consequences.
The number of adolescents in grades 6 
through 12 who have used e-cigarettes at least once rose from 3.3 percent to 6.8 percent from 2011 to 2012, according to the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention.
TJ Harrington, a Santa Fe College profes-
sor and the executive director of the Tobacco 
Prevention Network of Florida, said electronic 
cigarettes can function as “youth initiation products.”
About 90 percent of new smokers are be-tween the ages 11 and 18, he said, and the e-cigarette can be a product that introduces them to smoking.
“Tobacco companies are highly invested in the e-cigarette market and have been known for decades to market to a younger age group,” Harrington said, “and there is not enough information on the product for teenagers to know better.”
E-cigarettes often contain the addictive 
drug nicotine in smaller doses and are said to lack the tobacco and some of the toxins pres-
ent in traditional cigarettes. The device heats a 
ﬂ  avored liquid solution, which creates a vapor meant to simulate tobacco smoke. Electronic cigarette usage doubles, concerns local expertsSEE NORMAN, PAGE 4

� THE BUSES ARE VALUED AT 
ABOUT $90,000. 
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce is 
looking for information about two county 
school buses stolen sometime between Sun-day afternoon and early Monday morning from a Hawthorne bus yard.
The buses, both yellow with ﬂ  at-top 
fronts, were reported missing early Mon-day from the lot near Hawthorne Middle/High School football ﬁ  eld, said ASO spokes-man Lt. Todd Kelly. The buses, one made in 2008 and the other 2009, were each valued at about $90,000. They’re numbered 2804 and 2703 with Florida tags 239578 and TC4561. 
The buses serviced Chester Shell Ele-
mentary School, Waldo Community School, Lincoln Middle School, Bishop Middle School and Hawthorne Middle/High School. However, bus service will not be af-fected, said Jackie Johnson, Alachua County Schools spokeswoman. 
“We always have extra buses to handle routes,” Johnson said, adding that the school system has about 225 buses for the roughly 42 schools in the county.
There are a few possible reasons why a 
thief would target a bus, Kelly said. Some 
criminals put the vehicles on shipping con-
tainers to sell overseas. Others disassemble the buses to sell for parts. He also said bus theft could be a sign of terrorist activity be-cause school buses blend in on roads and can carry large amounts of cargo.
“Fortunately, there’s been nothing to re-
ally support that at any point,” he said.
A theft like this hasn’t occurred recently 
in Alachua County. However, the Flagler County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce is dealing with a similar incident after two county school buses were stolen July 27, according a Fla-gler County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce press release.
Kelly said he wasn’t sure if video is avail-
able for the Alachua County bus thefts or if the buses are equipped with GPS devices. However, a detective has been assigned to 
the case, he said. 
Anyone with information about the 
thefts is encouraged to contact the Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce at 352-955-1818.Big yellow school buses stolenLIFESTYLE

Rising college tuition and fear of 
thousands of dollars in student loans are 
prompting more parents to save for col-
lege.
A Fidelity Investments annual study 
showed that 69 percent of parents have started to save money for college — the highest percentage since 2007, when 58 percent of parents saved.
Most parents do not want their chil-
dren to be burdened with debt because “it will set them back ﬁ  nancially for years,” said James Di Virgilio, a Gainesville ﬁ  nan-cial planner.
Manuel Fernandez, an 18-year-old UF 
political science freshman, said his par-ents pay for all of his and his twin sister’s expenses beyond what Bright Futures and Florida Prepaid covers.
Fernandez said his father is still paying 
off loans from medical school and that he does not want to graduate with debt that takes years to pay off.“Coming out of college with $100,000 
in debt can take 30 years to pay off on a $35,000 salary,” Di Virgilio said.
Maureen McFarlane, associate director 
of ﬁ  nancial aid at Santa Fe College, said saving for college gives students more ﬂ  exibility.
“If parents are saving, then they have 
more opportunities and options available when the child is ready to go to college,” McFarlane said.
Cara Mannion, a 21-year-old UF jour-
nalism and English senior, said she is proud to have put herself through col-lege.
Mannion does not have Florida Pre-
paid and receives minimal help from her parents. Although she receives Florida Bright Futures and merit-based scholar-ships within her majors, she still works 32 hours a week at the UF Graduate Editorial 
Ofﬁ  ce, she said.
“I am way ahead of the game in life, 
and it won’t be as much of a culture shock 
to pay for my expenses once I graduate,” Mannion said.As college tuition increases, 
so does parents’ savingsCHRISTINE FLAMMIA

Students looking to save money on a col-
lege education can consider swapping conven-
tional classrooms and on-campus housing for an online program or a commute to campus.
Fifty percent of parents said they would 
consider having their child commute while living at home, according to a new study from Fidelity Investments. An even higher 54 per-
cent said their children should take courses 
online.
UF might make a parent’s money-saving 
strategy a reality. UF Online will offer a full bachelor’s degree program completely online. 
UF spokesman Chris Moran said with UF 
Online, in-state students will have a 25 percent discount on tuition. But he said the admissions standards are still the same. 
“This isn’t a consolation prize,” he said. 
“This is the same UF education, the same de-gree, the same rigorous standards. It’s just a different way of delivering it.”
Another alternative way students try to 
save money is by living at home and commut-
ing.Yasmeen Shanata, a UF public relations ju-
nior, commutes about 10 minutes to campus 
from her home in Gainesville to save money.
Although Shanata, 20, might be earning 
back some cash, she said her college experi-ence is different than a student who lives clos-er to campus.
“I don’t feel like I’m very connected with 
the campus,” she said. “You’re more indepen-dent when you live in an apartment.”
Jordan O’Connor, a UF health science ju-
nior, said she feels more independent now 
that she is no longer a commuter. The 20-year-
old commuted to UF as a freshman from her home in Ocala as a personal preference rather than for financial reasons.
However, after deciding to live closer to 
campus, she said buying fuel for her gas-guz-zling Jeep turned out to be the same cost as liv-ing in Gainesville.
Both O’Connor and Shanata said socializ-
ing was one of the main differences between commuting and living close to campus.
“I pretty much had no social life,” O’Connor 
said. “I had friends while I was in classes, but outside of that I didn’t really hang out with anybody.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2013

A record-low number of students 
qualified on the first day for Student 
Government’s Fall 2013 elections.
Supervisor of Elections Justin 
Hoover said 42 students qualified Mon-
day — a new low compared to about 80 
students in Spring, 78 in Fall 2012 and 48 in Spring 2012.
Hoover said the low turnout might 
be a result of the change in location be-cause of the Reitz Union construction. This year’s qualifying and slating dates also changed from Friday, Monday and Tuesday to Monday, Tuesday and 
Wednesday.
After qualifying, students could choose to run independently or slate 
with one of 11 parties registered: The Students Party, The Swamp Party, Key Party, Orange and Blue Party, Gator Party, Ignite Party, Frat Party, Progress Party, Greek Party, Unite Party and Keg Party.
Thirteen students slated with the 
Students Party, according to Campaign Manager Helie Dharia. Last semester 19 slated on the first day and 26 slated last fall.
Swamp Party spokesman Joseph 
Michaels said 29 students slated with his party. Monday’s turnout is a sharp decrease from about 60 students in 
spring and 40 students in Fall 2012.
Qualifying and slating continues 
through Wednesday in rooms 361, 362 
and 363 in the Reitz Union from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.Record low qualify for electionsLIFESTYLE

Using Facebook too much can cause un-
happiness.
A recent study published by the Public Li-
brary of Science examined 82 users in their late 
teens or early 20s and found that people who 
frequently used Facebook felt worse about 
themselves. Another study identified the most common negative emotion associated with Fa-cebook: envy.
“The way we make sense out of the world 
is we compare ourselves to others,” said UF Counseling & Wellness Center counselor Lin-da Lewis. “It’s not a very productive strategy, and if somebody came in talking to me about 
that, I would try to look at what’s really going 
on there.”
She also said self-comparison is rampant 
in all forms of social media but suggested that Facebook could be “amplifying” the self-com-paring nature of people. 
Marketing junior Jessica Mabrey, 20,  said 
she could understand how Facebook could worsen the feelings of those already upset. 
“But I don’t see it being something that 
would make someone who is otherwise hap-py, sad,” she said.
Lewis said the people most hurt by social 
networking were likely dissatisfied to begin with.
“If you’re prone to low self-esteem, and 
your really important activity is seeing who’s better, who’s better looking, who’s got more 
dates … you’re going to find what you’re look-
ing for,” she said.Excessive Facebook use can lead

Teenagers could form habits smoking the flavored e-cigarettes
Some UF health professionals expressed concerns about the 
effect electronic cigarettes may have on teenagers because they 
are still in the developmental stages.
Hannah Renno, who is in her last year at UF’s Pediatric Res-
idency Program, said if adults spent their lives smoking two 
packs of cigarettes a day, it would “still be healthier than some-
one in the pediatric age range smoking electronic cigarettes at all.”Alberto Regalado, a 20-year-old UF sociology junior, said 
he has seen the increase in popularity firsthand. When he went to buy his first e-cigarette in Miami for about $40, he saw two veteran smokers trying out the electronic device.“I went two or three months later to buy new liquid,” he 
said. “It was 2 p.m. on a Monday, and it was literally packed.”
Regalado added that he’s a big fan of the devices. He said 
he gives them credit for getting his mother, who smoked for 25 years, to quit.
Regalado’s favorite flavors are inspired by desserts like ap-
ple pie and biscotti, but he’s also a fan of the sweet flavors’ even sweeter side effects, he said.
“I went from girls telling me, ‘Ew, you smell like cigarettes,’ 
to girls telling me, ‘That smells really good,’” he said. “Appar-ently I taste like it, too, so that’s a plus.”E-cIg , from page 1
Signs tell students, faculty to use bathrooms in ‘new’ Norman Hall
Norman Hall and its addition for two days, 
leaking subsided, determining the source of the leak. Water to the addition was restored afterward.
That day, Renee Long was in Norman Hall 
for eight hours. The 25-year-old education ju-nior had to cross SW 13th Street to find a bath-room.“I just had to pray that I didn’t have to go to 
the bathroom during class,” she said.
The 79-year-old building’s water runs 
through pipes located underneath the building from a water main on SW 12th Street. Instead of drilling under the building again, workers are laying a new 4-inch pipe around the build-ing to connect to the same water main. Rozear said workers have pre-existing contracts with UF and did not know the cost of the repair.The College of Education 
within Norman Hall taped off bathrooms and posted signs redirecting students to use the bathrooms in “New” Norman Hall. The 
signs also warn of a biologi-cal hazard, as waste could not be flushed down and 
posed a potential health risk.“It’s like being in the Dark Ages,” said 
Thomas Dana, associate dean of the College of Education.
Environmental engineering freshman Pad-
mini Persaud, 17, ignored the warning signs at first but soon realized the restrooms would be out of order for a while.
“It’s annoying because I’m thirsty all the 
time,” she said. “It’s such a long walk, and when I get there, there’s no water.”

For about a year, White Cat watched over the 
lawns of Kappa Delta and Delta Delta Delta, pacing 
between the back porches and stealing the hearts of sisters on Sorority Row.
He was the guardian of East Panhellenic Drive. 
Some attempted to pet him.
Last week he was found dead, lying on the side-
walk between Kappa Delta and Tri Delta. The cause of death is unknown.
To most, he died without a name, just another 
stray cat that calls UF home, but to 22-year-old UF alumna Hayley Plant, he was a friend known as White Cat.
“White Cat and I bonded so much last year and 
I’ve gone into serious depression [about his death]...,” Plant posted on Facebook.
The news came as a shock to Plant, who said the 
animal was a young, spry cat.
One Kappa Delta sister described him as the John 
Mayer of felines because he didn’t care about any-thing and he loved the ladies.
Last Fall, Plant loaded the cat in her car to get him 
neutered. After the procedure, Plant took White Cat 
into the Kappa Delta mailroom and nursed him back 
to health. After he recovered, Kappa Delta’s house mother, Denby Smothers, made Plant take the cat to the wooded area near Royal Village apartments, an area known to house a large stray cat community.
White Cat eventually found his way back to So-
rority Row and began prowling for hidden scraps of food purposely left behind by students.
The cat also bonded with Anne Cappello, a 
21-year-old advertising and business administration senior in Tri Delta.
“I would always come up and say hi to him and 
pet him, and then actually one time we shared ice 
cream,” Cappello said.
About a week ago, Cappello was one of the ﬁ  rst 
to hear about White Cat’s death after Sophie Gray, a 
21-year-old elementary education senior, told her of a dead animal outside of their sorority house. Cap-pello immediately went to check and was stunned when she saw who it was.
“It’s sad that I’m not going to be able to see his 
face in the morning before I go to class,” Gray said.
“ ... he may have been the only cat to have ever 
shacked in Kappa Delta,” Plant said in her Facebook post. “He might not have been a looker but damn, he was a lover.”Sororities mourn late, great White Cat

manager Jarret Kanuth said the 
community seemed to respond positively to the opening. 
“Business has been nonstop. I 
don’t think there’s been a break in trafﬁ  c, the ﬂ  ow of business, since we opened our doors,” he said. 
Kevin Lozano, a UF music edu-
cation junior, said he thinks Guitar 
Center will ﬁ  nd its own niche in 
Gainesville.
He said it doesn’t have a classi-cal sheet music collection like that of Hoggtowne Music. 
Jamie Miller, a UF music and 
criminology junior, agreed that 
Guitar Center won’t detract busi-
ness from Hoggtowne Music.
But she said Lipham Music 
may face ﬁ  ercer competition from the new business.
“It’s like the same thing, 
but Guitar Center has a name. Lipham’s Music has the ‘mom and pop’ feel,” she said.
Kanuth said bringing a major 
music chain to Gainesville isn’t about hurting competitors.
“Music is one of those things 
that is a universal language,” he said. “That’s what we’re all about, spreading the musical language throughout Gainesville and the surrounding cities. That’s our 
main focus.”New player among

Blind Item: 
Iowa grants guns to 
visually impaired
There must be something in the corn: On Sunday, The 
Des Moines Register published an extensively re-searched article on a strange loophole in Iowa gun laws. 
Thanks to gun permit changes that took effect in Iowa in 2011, people with visual impairments can legally carry guns with 
them almost anywhere.
Private gun ownership for hunting isn’t new for Iowans, 
the article stated. However, ofﬁ  cials around the nation are 
confused as to how this strange loophole came to exist. Polk County ofﬁ  cials said they issued weapons permits to at least three people who couldn’t legally drive; were unable to read the application forms; or had difﬁ  culty reading the forms due to visual impairment.
The issue is straight out of a Seth-and-Amy “Saturday 
Night Live” segment. Clearly, it’s worrisome to consider that somewhere, a person who can barely ﬁ  ll out the necessary pa-perwork is receiving a permit to carry a gun to the feed store, or wherever people hang out in corn country.
According to the article in The Register, the Gun Control 
Act of 1968 and other federal laws don’t explicitly prohibit blind people from owning guns — so what makes Iowa dif-ferent?
Many other states have enacted laws that detail speciﬁ  c re-
quirements for blind persons seeking guns and gun permits.
According to The Register, for example, Nebraskan appli-
cants who seek permits to legally carry a concealed handgun must provide “proof of vision”: either a valid state driver’s license or a statement by an eye doctor that the individual meets vision requirements set for a typical vehicle operator’s license.
Patrick Clancy, superintendent of the Iowa Braille and 
Sight Saving School, was ambivalent when he spoke to The 
Register. On one hand, he said he believed guns may be the 
exception to the philosophy that blind people can participate fully in life. On the other hand, he told The Register that the range of sight among people who are classiﬁ  ed as legally blind varies signiﬁ  cantly — and there may be situations where such applicants can safely handle a gun.
Cedar County Sheriff Warren Wethington, who happens 
to have a blind daughter, demonstrated for The Register how blind people could be taught to shoot guns. In addition, Jane 
Hudson, executive director of Disability Rights Iowa, said 
blocking persons with visual impairment from obtaining gun permits violates the Americans with Disabilities Act — the law prohibits different treatment based on a person’s physi-cal disabilities.
“The fact that you can’t drive a car doesn’t mean you can’t 
go to a shooting range and see a target,” Hudson told The Register.
Blindness and visual impairment come in many different 
shades. Someone who’s classiﬁ  ed as legally blind may not see 
only blackness, for example. However, like many other states 
— including our own “Gunshine State” — Iowa could stand 
some ﬁ  rearm law policy changes.In defense of Macklemore’s “Same Love”
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are undeniably the 
most successful breakout artists of 2013. 
The two preach messages that contrast stark-
ly with their musical peers: choosing passion over money, 
reaching one’s highest potential and bargain shopping for swagniﬁ  cent Velcro shoes. Critics and fans alike have re-warded them for their sincere lyrics and respectable mes-sages. That is, until “Same Love” hit the radio.
Of course, “Same Love” was applauded for its posi-
tive message advocating equal marriage rights for the 
gay community. Macklemore’s ﬁ  rst verse illustrates the role of stereotypes in the dynamics of homophobia. 
He highlights the painful and all-too-common usage of 
hateful slurs online and in the hip-hop genre.
However, the rapper found himself under ﬁ  re for ad-
dressing an issue not his own. 
How could a straight, white male produce a work 
that accurately depicts the issues surrounding homo-sexuality? It’s an argument worth considering.
In a blog post about writing “Same Love,” Macklem-
ore stated he hoped the song would “advance the dia-
logue” surrounding rights for LGBT Americans. He had 
tried penning the tune from the perspective of a young gay student but realized quickly it “wasn’t [his] story to tell.”
All things considered, it seems unfair to condemn 
the man for speaking out on an issue in need of repre-sentation both in the world at large and speciﬁ  cally in the realm of hip-hop. 
A straight man speaking out for the rights of a mar-
ginalized group he doesn’t belong to is a start to break-ing down the walls of exclusivity.
In an interview with NYC’s Hot 97, Macklemore ex-
plained his desire to hold the hip-hop community ac-countable for its oppression of LGBT people.
“That’s my community,” he said of the music genre, 
one known for its intolerance of homosexuality.As Aimee Anderson, an Eng-
lish instructor at Santa Fe Col-lege, outlined in her Hufﬁ  ngton 
Post blog, if the song accom-
plishes nothing else, at least it’s able to spark a “cross-cultural conversation” between the gay 
and black communities.
Certainly, LGBT individu-
als feel there are larger ﬁ  sh to fry than certain hip-hop 
artists, but Macklemore should be commended for af-fecting change in his own arena. He used his newfound 
fame to preach positivity and acceptance in an effort to 
amend the genre’s hateful past.
Skeptics also wonder — and rightly so — if Mack-
lemore is just a good businessman. 
Is he capitalizing on the times? This summer has been a pivotal one, what with all 
the news surrounding the Defense of Marriage Act and Proposition 8. If ever the time was right for launching “Same Love,” he found it.
If so, the joke is on him. He penned an anthem about 
one of the largest social issues of our generation that grabbed the world’s attention, so regardless of intent, the product is beneﬁ  cial. But due to Macklemore’s in-
volvement with the “You Can Play” project, an initia-
tive to combat homophobia in sports, it seems unlikely he’s fronting about his passion for the issue. Also, it’s no secret his uncles inspired the song, making the issue seem even closer to home.
Hateful words and stereotypes have historical con-
text in need of further unpacking, but Macklemore’s in-ﬂ  uence exists only in the space of a three-minute tune, and he did what he could. How could anyone condemn 
him for that?

The way the Obama administration is handling the 
conﬂ  ict in Syria can be summed up in one word: hap-hazardly.
Many seemed surprised that the president carried out 
one of the most signiﬁ  cant foreign policy victories in recent history — the killing of Osama bin Laden. What is over-looked is the fact that President Barack Obama has fumbled 
continuously on the foreign policy front. 
It is all too easy to start with the recent Syrian conﬂ  ict. 
The president famously drew a red line on chemical 
weapons last year and has failed to act on that threat until recently. He claimed then that no regime change would take 
place. Now, he demands it. 
He was all too ready to strike Syria until he wanted the 
input of a fractured Congress. 
This move puts the administration in even more of a pre-
dicament. 
If Congress strikes down the intervention measure, all of 
the president’s tough talk and line-drawing will have gotten 
him nowhere. If the president plans to strike without con-gressional support, he would successfully circumvent the 
dissenting people’s branch.
If America ultimately decides to attack Syria, would this 
set a precedent that we should attack other nations with 
dangerous weapons? Should we therefore attack North Ko-
rea or Iran? 
The last country we directly intervened in — and conse-
quently also had a haphazard intervention and exit strategy 
— was Libya. After the intervention and on the 11th anni-versary of 9/11, terrorists attacked the U.S. Consulate and 
killed four Americans.  
In 2009, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented 
her Russian counterpart with a cartoonish “reset” button 
with the hopes of improving the relationship between the 
two countries. 
However, the relationship has signiﬁ  cantly worsened. 
Russia and the U.S. currently are engaged in Cold War ten-
sions — tensions escalated by the mishandling of the NSA leaker Eric Snowden.  
Snowden’s leaking of America’s spying policy not only 
hurt America’s relationship with Russia, but also irked Ger-many, Colombia and many of our other allies.
Let’s not forget our rocky relationship with China. In re-
gard to Syria, the administration is doubling down on Rus-sia for backing Assad, but China is not receiving the same treatment.  This double standard undermines 
U.S. credibility abroad.  
The president is also not ad-
dressing the cyberattacks from Chi-
nese hackers on our newspapers, 
government agencies and small 
businesses.
The president’s statements about foreign terrorism is 
contradictory to reality. Obama stated that “al-Qaeda has been decimated” — however, we currently see the group 
spreading and gaining strength in African countries such as 
Mali and Nigeria.
The candidate who ran as the antithesis of George Bush 
now is expanding Bush’s foreign policy. 
Many remember Obama making a historical speech in 
Berlin. He addressed the anti-American sentiment in Eu-rope and called for a change in perception.
“The view that America is part of what has gone wrong 
in our world, rather than a force to help make it right, has 
become all too common,” he said.
The candidate of “hope and change” has fallen short of 
expectations. 
By and large, America’s standing in the world has not 
changed for the better, though our country sees itself be-
coming far too involved in it. Citizens of other countries like Barack Obama as a person but fail to relate to his grand vision of American inﬂ  uence in an increasingly dangerous and uncertain world. 
This is where Obama’s administration fails: It lacks a co-
herent vision of American inﬂ  uence in the world. The ad-ministration is failing to advance American interests abroad, lacks the ability to send a clear message to our enemies and 
is becoming too entangled in countries that will not directly 
beneﬁ  t America.  
In Syria, we currently see that lack of vision and compre-
hensive plan in action. 
The administration fumbles to build an international 
coalition or even get the measure through Congress. Even more unfortunate for the administration, it does not have another bin Laden to kill.

Annually, Americans observe National 
Hispanic Heritage Month from Sept. 
15 to Oct. 15 to celebrate the histories, 
cultures and contributions of American citizens 
who trace their ancestors from Mexico, Spain, 
the Caribbean, and Central and South Ameri-
ca.
Hispanic Heritage 
Week began under President Lyndon 
Johnson in 1968 and 
was expanded under President Ronald Reagan in 1988 to encom-pass a 30-day period. It was enacted into law on August 17, 1988, on the approval of Public 
Law 100-402.
Sept. 15 was chosen as the start date because 
of its signiﬁ  cance as the anniversary of inde-pendence for Latin American countries Costa 
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and 
Nicaragua. Mexico and Chile celebrate their 
independence days on Sept. 16 and Sept. 18, respectively.
Hispanic-Latinos are now the largest racial 
minority in the U.S., comprised of roughly 50.5 million people — about 16.3 percent of the total U.S. population. Census Bureau data projects that the Hispanic population as of July 1, 2050, 
will be 132.8 million, or 30 percent of the total 
population. According to the data, this repre-sents a 43 percent increase from April 1, 2000 and April 1, 2010, making Hispanics the fastest 
growing minority group.
The Hispanic-Latino population in Florida 
is the third largest in the nation. Florida’s His-
panic community represents 16 percent of the eligible voters. The Hispanic-Latino group is 
not monolithic, either — Cubans represent 32 
percent of Florida’s eligible Hispanic voters, whereas Puerto Ricans comprise 28 percent and Mexicans account for 9 percent. Taking a 
different view, the nation’s Hispanic-Latino 
voting demographics represent 59 percent Mexican, 14 percent Puerto Rican and 5 percent Cuban, according to the Center for American Progress.
The Chamber of Hispanic Affairs in 
Gainesville cordially invites you to our most notable program: the annual Downtown Latino Festival, which takes place at the Downtown Community Plaza every September during Na-
tional Hispanic Heritage Month. This year the 
12th Annual Downtown Latino Festival will take place Sept. 28 from 12 to 8 p.m.
The festival will celebrate the positive con-
tributions and achievements of the Latino com-munity. It is a chance for Gainesville residents to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with the Chamber of Hispanic Affairs. We strive to con-
nect the Hispanic population and greater com-
munity with resources such as health aware-ness, disease testing, non-proﬁ  ts, community resources and more. The festival’s attendance 
has usually been between 1,000 to 3,000 people 
every year.
The event will include food vendors, infor-
mational booths, cultural performances and 
live music. The festival is free and open to the 
public.

tino U.S. population, visit www.census.gov/

The Digital Services Department of the George 
A. Smathers Libraries is working toward build-
ing a digital collection of all dissertations written 
at UF from 1934 to 2006. 
The collection will include approximately 
12,000 dissertations upon completion.
Project coordinator and library assistant Chris-
ty Shorey said the Digital Services Department is 
about one-third of the way through with the proj-
ect. She expects the project to be completed in a couple of years.
Once the library receives approval from the 
author to digitize the contents of a dissertation, the process takes about eight months to complete. 
Shorey and her team complete quality control 
checks before and after they outsource the mate-rial to a third party to be scanned into the sys-
tem. 
This process includes flipping page by page 
through both the original and digitized docu-ments to make sure they are as accurate as pos-
sible, Shorey said. “We are digitizing these dissertations partly 
to have more accessibility to earlier scholarship 
and partly to help foster new research,” she said.
Shorey said the main goal of this project is to 
make all the scholarship completed at the univer-sity available globally.
Barbara Hood, director of communications at 
the George A. Smathers Libraries, is working to-ward exposing this project to alumni who might 
not be aware of it. 
According to a news release, authors who 
cannot be located will still have their work digi-tized but will have the option to “opt out” if they choose to keep their dissertations private.
Kristin Page, a doctoral student at the College 
of Education, said it is important to read previous dissertations to help her write her own.
Page said that these days, all research is done 
online and previous dissertations help serve as the framework for new knowledge or to see 
where research on a particular topic has gone 
over time. 
“It is very rare that I will actually go to the li-
brary and look for a paper document,” she said.UF Libraries working toward

Kardashian followers are hurt-
ing  their, like, vocal cords. 
The guttural “vocal fry” sounds 
could prove dangerous for those 
who parrot the vocal style of some 
celebrities.
Stars like Kim Kardashian and 
Britney Spears, who are known to 
speak with the low pitch “uhhh” sound along with words such as “like” that exemplify vocal fry, in-spire many people to pick up the potentially detrimental habit.
“If you do it enough you can 
create a lot of tiredness in your voice,” said Judith Wingate, clini-cal associate professor and speech-language pathologist at UF. “It can lead you to squeeze the muscles in the throat and cause problems.”
She continued: “Essentially 
what’s happening is the vo-cal folds are closed longer than they’re open as you speak, so you get this creaky popping sound.”
Vocal frying can cause wear on vocal cords, and can be heard in everyday speech.
“We hear vocal fry in young la-
dies who are trying to sound more mature, and young men who are trying to sound more macho,” said Ronald Burrichter, professor of music at UF.
Professional football players 
typically end their careers by 35 due to the abuse on their bodies — and the same reasoning applies to celebrities who use vocal fry as a type of style, Burrichter said.
“In order to be a more effec-
tive communicator, you need to take the time to figure out how to 
properly articulate your thoughts 
to others,” said Danielle Espino, a 20-year-old linguistics junior at UF.
There are certain measures that 
can be taken to avoid the negative effects of vocal fry.    
“Vary your pitch, and make 
sure you’re using sufficient air 
when you speak,” said Wingate. 
“To be on the safe side, I wouldn’t recommend people do (vocal fry) for more than a couple of minutes a day.”
Burrichter said celebrities who 
are frying their voices are more concerned about making money than they are about the health of 
their voices.
“The voice is a finite instru-
ment, it is not indestructible,” Bur-
richter said. “Once it is injured, it is never quite the same.”Talking like Kardashians

Kristen O’Brien goes to a class 
knowing she won’t receive credit. 
The 21-year-old English senior doesn’t need the class for her major and isn’t enrolled in it.
“It sounded like stuff that I 
would want to know later on in life,” O’Brien said. “Things that I wanted to use.”
Although O’Brien is not paying 
for the extra workload, other stu-dents are paying for classes they won’t receive credit for.Students, staff and faculty can 
audit classes. Although students will have to pay for the class, they 
won’t receive a grade or credit at the 
end of the semester.
Joseph Spillane, College of Liber-
al Arts and Sciences associate dean for student affairs, said the univer-sity would prefer if students didn’t sit in on classes without registering.
But, Spillane said, formally ap-
plying to audit a course is simple. If there is space, a student can fill a form out with the approval of the college and submit it.
Yumiko Hulvey, an associate 
professor of Japanese, has had stu-dents audit her classes before.
“I had an auditor who took all 
the quizzes,” Hulvey said. “But she elected not to write any of the papers. It depends on how much the auditor wants to be a part of the class.”
O’Brien said she wants to do as-
signments but doesn’t want to buy the course pack.
“I don’t see a reason that a stu-
dent couldn’t just sit and learn,” she said. “It’s better than students skip-ping.”A different kind of sit-in: Students

Vacant warehouses may become functional business 
space once again if a Gainesville Regional Utilities plan 
to sell surplus properties goes through.
Gainesville Community Redevelopment Agency is 
spearheading the project to revamp warehouses on four separate properties totaling about 40 acres. Three of the buildings are part of the downtown Power District on Southeast Fifth Avenue.
Amelia Bell, a GRU spokeswoman, wrote in an email 
that the buildings are for sale with the purpose of rede-velopment.
Bell wrote vacant locations are a direct effect of the 
utility company’s consolidation into the GRU Eastside 
Operations Center, which opened about three years ago on North Main Street.
“The facility enabled us to con-
solidate operations, which increased efficiency by improving service and 
providing faster response times,” she wrote. “When we moved to the EOC, several buildings downtown near our administration building were va-cated.”
City Commissioner Thomas 
Hawkins said that while downtown Gainesville has his-torically acted as an industrial center, the city hopes to use these properties to develop something entirely dif-ferent.
“We no longer need to use the GRU property for in-
dustrial uses,” he said. “We think it’s more important to have those outside of town than inside.”
Last February, Prioria Robotics, a technology firm 
developed by UF graduates, took the first step in the process when it moved into a surplus GRU warehouse 
along South Depot Avenue.Local redevelopment agency leads

Back in 2001, most textbooks 
cost less than half the price they 
do now.
Textbook prices have risen 
by 102 percent since December 2001, according to a report by Bloomberg published Thursday. 
The overall price of consumer 
goods has increased only 32 per-cent in the same amount of time, according to the report. 
Lynne Vaughan, director of 
the UF Bookstore, said she has noticed this trend. 
She said various factors con-
tribute to the rising prices.
“They don’t keep the books 
out long,” Vaughan said. “Three years seems like a long time for a textbook to stay relevant. Pub-lishers are trying to stay in busi-
ness. In my opinion, they push 
the authors for new editions.”
New technologies make text-
books more expensive, whether 
it’s the publishing rights to high-
resolution photos in science books or bundling a pre-existing book into a package with a click-
er, Vaughan said.
Although the UF Bookstore 
offers used books as a lower-
priced option, Austin Harvey, 
a 21-year-old biological engi-
neering senior, said he skips the bookstores altogether.
“If it is something that per-
tains directly to my major, and 
I can use it again in the future, 
I buy it off of Amazon,” he said. “But for the majority of books, I rent them from Chegg.”
Harvey said the online text-
book vendor www.Chegg.com has offered him the best prices. 
But he said he skips buying 
the textbook if a professor lets 
him know that it isn’t entirely 
crucial to passing the course.
“I’m a cost-efficient college 
student,” he said.
As a side note, Vaughan said 
professors at UF who write their own textbooks do not receive royalties from the sales they make to UF students.TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

  Jeff Driskel suffered a “slight 
sprain to the knee” against Miami, 
UF announced Monday. The inju-
ry was part of a forgettable, mug-
gy Saturday in Sun Life Stadium. He is expected to return to face Tennessee on Sept. 21, aiming to build on the good — a career-high 291 passing yards — and improve on the bad — his three turnovers 
against the Hurricanes. 
  His productive day resulted 
in Solomon Patton’s 118 receiv-
ing yards, which marked the most productive game for a wide re-ceiver in Driskel’s 14 games as a 
starter.
  Eight pass plays of 15-plus 
yards do not matter. Leading an offense to 413 total yards does not matter. A fumble and two inter-
ceptions do. 
  “You can’t beat him down,” 
center Jon Harrison said. “You can’t attack him. You can’t criticize 
him about everything, because it’s 
not all on him. There’s no ‘I’ in team. Football deﬁ  nitely isn’t a singular sport. It’s a team sport, 
and we can’t pass all the blame on 
Driskel.”

         In the ﬁ  nale of the Campus USA Invite last week, Florida re-
bounded to defeat Duke after showing some signs of weakness 
against LIU-Brooklyn the previous night.
  Madison Monserez addressed the media following the vic-
tory over the Blue Devils and commended the Gators’ ability to make corrections within 24 hours of a match.
  But No. 5 Florida took a step in the wrong direction Sunday 
by dropping three straight sets to then-No. 1 Penn State just a day after coach Mary Wise’s squad knocked off then-No. 2 Stanford.
  Wise said it is more difﬁ  cult for her team to adapt to the 
playing style of schools outside the Southeastern Conference because the Gators don’t always get much time to learn about non-conference opponents.
  “We approached this weekend like all of our preseason 
tournaments where you learn about players you don’t play on a regular basis,” she said. “The turnaround in this tournament is so fast. It’s something we don’t have to face in the SEC because the teams are so familiar with each other.”
  The challenge of a quick turnaround is made even more dif-
ﬁ  cult when facing the some of the top teams in the nation.
  This year’s Nike Big Four Classic marked the second time in 
UF history it faced the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in one weekend. In 2003, No. 3 Florida defeated No. 2 Hawaii in the NCAA Final Four before falling to No. 1 USC in the national championship match.
  Wise said the stiff competition in the regular season allows 
the Gators to get a feel for the playoff atmosphere they will see in December if they make the NCAA Tournament.
  “All four non-conference weekends really do prepare us 
for postseason when you’re learning about players for the ﬁ  rst time,” Wise said. Early loss prepares 
Florida for rigors

 The Jacksonville Jaguars do not want Tim Tebow. Get 
over it.
  I know the connection is convenient. Talking heads 
on ESPN have force-fed us the narrative for years. Even those of us who avoid First Take like the plague can’t completely block out the nonsense.
  “He’s a hometown hero!”
  “He’ll sell tickets!”
  “He’s a winner!”  Stop it. Just stop.  New Jaguars general manager David Caldwell made the 
franchise’s approach to Tebow rumors clear during his intro-ductory press conference on Jan. 10.
  “I can’t imagine a scenario where he’d be a Jaguar,” Caldwell said of the 2007 Heisman Trophy win-ner. “Even if he’s released.”
  Two NFL teams have released 
Tebow since then, and as far as we know, nobody from the Jaguars has contacted the guy. I doubt any NFL team has made him an offer to play 
quarterback since the Patriots cut the 
former Gator on Aug. 31.
  But after the rebuilding Jaguars suffered an ugly 28-2 loss to 
the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, the Tebow trolls re-emerged, chirping their ﬂ  awed and baseless rhetoric.
  Tebow will not ﬁ  x this team. The only remedy is a mix of 
time and smart draft picks. There is not an overnight cure.  For instance, Jacksonville’s interior offensive line is atro-
cious, and it’s not getting better anytime soon.
  Slam Blaine Gabbert’s pocket presence all you want, but not  
even Peyton Manning could consistently stand strong behind that offensive line and produce.
  But don’t misconstrue this column as a defense of Gabbert.  As bad as the former Missouri Tiger has played, at least he 
doesn’t generate a messy media storm every time he gets out of bed in the morning. His failures are quiet and under the radar, only brieﬂ  y mentioned in weekly NFL power rankings.
  Meanwhile, ESPN treated Tebow’s 25th birthday like a na-
tional holiday.

Annie Speese attempts a shot during Florida’s 2-0 win against Okla -
homa State on Sunday at James G. Pressly Stadium.
MICHELLE PROVENZANO
Alligator Writer @mmprovenzano
     Midfielders Havana Solaun 
and Annie Speese’s chemistry bodes well for Florida’s offense.
With a seasonopening week-
end that turned the spotlight on freshman Savannah Jordan and her record-breaking five goals, 
the traditional Florida soccer 
style over the past two years seemed like a thing of the past. 
However, the juniors showed 
their tenacity and experience 
when they took the field against 
Oklahoma State on Sunday, grab-bing two goals and two assists in a 2-0 victory. 
Solaun and Speese are not 
strangers to the give-and-go play they demonstrated Sunday  — the two have found each other to complete three goals in the past 
two years.
Two of those goals came 
during their freshman year, one 
against Southeastern Confer-
ence opponent Kentucky and the 
other a cushion goal to help the Gators to a 7-2 victory against Kansas. 
“Those two always pair up 
when you’re doing any type of small group exercises,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“They have great chemistry 
together because they not only play together in the 11 v. 11 games, but they’re always play-ing together in practice.”
Solaun and Speese’s bond off 
the field plays a role in their abil-ity to find each other in the right place at the right time.
Sunday’s pair of goals came 
because of consistent communi-
cation between the two.
“I always know [Solaun is] 
going to be looking for the ball, 
so I just laid it off to her right foot and she put it away,” Speese said.
Burleigh added: “[Speese and 
Solaun] do a terrific job of read-ing each other. 
“They both have great soccer 
minds so they understand what’s 
going to happen before it hap-
pens.”
Sunday’s matchup was just 
a sample of what the two have been doing for the team for three 
years. 
Solaun was tied with then-
senior Jo Dragotta as the second-leading goal scorer in 2012. She 
has 16 career goals and 15 career assists to her name. 
Speese has been a dual threat 
as a goal scorer and playmaker, scoring 14 goals and notching 17 assists in her college career.
Even with the upperclass-
men making strides for the 
Gators, Speese said there are still 
improvements to be made on of-fense this season.
In Sunday’s game, the Gators 
took 17 shots on goal despite scoring only twice.
“We need to be more dynamic 
in the attacking third,” Speese said. 
“We’re still not getting too 
many runs beyond the ball, and I think that’s something we’ll see more in practice. But we’re 
starting to pick up a little bit of 
rhythm, so hopefully that’ll con-tinue in the next couple weeks.”
Freshman wins award: Fresh-
man Pamela Begic won the SEC 
Freshman of the Week award  
Monday.
Begic scored her second goal 
of the season against Okla-
homa on Friday and provided a 
secondary assist to Solaun’s first goal against Oklahoma State on Sunday.
“I think Pam is finally real-
izing that she can be a little more of a threat offensively,” Burleigh said Friday. “That’s really good 
to see because it’s hard to defend 
height.” Junior midfielders sparking UF

      The second round of the Cougar 
Classic at Yeamans Hall Club on 
Monday saw a shakeup on the leaderboard.
Florida (+2) moved up three 
spots to fifth place after a 1-under-par performance. But UF is 11 strokes behind leader Clemson (-9). 
The Tiger’s attack was spear-
headed by Sloan Shanahan and Ashlan Ramsey, who each shot 3-under par. Sunday’s leader, Mississippi State (-3), dropped to second due to a 3-over-par out-
ing. South Carolina (+7) fell from 
second to seventh.
Five of the eight Southeastern 
Conference teams remain in the top 10 after Monday’s round. Missis-sippi State is the only SEC team ranked higher than No. 5 Florida. After the Bulldogs’ stumble during the second day, another solid per-
formance by the Gators during the 
final round could vault them ahead. 
UF took advantage of other 
teams’ struggles on the 72-par course by minimizing mistakes. 
Maria Torres (-3) and Anna 
Young (E) finished at 1-under par, while Katie Mitchell (+4) shot par.
At the end of the second round, 
individual play has a tie for the lead. Mississippi State’s Ally McDonald was even on the day to remain at 6-under par and holds a share of the lead for the second straight day. 
Shanahan duplicated her score 
from the first round by putting in a 69 on Day Two, bringing her to 6-under par while sharing the top spot on the leaderboard. 
Torres is currently leading the 
Gators. She’s in a tie for third at 3-under par after shooting a 71 on Monday, including three birdies on the last four holes. Her next 
closest teammate is Young, who has 
drawn to par for the tournament after matching Torres’ score in the second round by notching an eagle at the 18th hole. Young is now tied for 16th overall.
Freshman Karolina Vlckova re-
peated Sunday’s performance with another 73, but Mitchell managed 
to recover from a 76 on Sunday 
with a 72 on Monday. 
Camilla Hedberg (+8) struggled 
again.

      Cory McGee is trying to catch her breath. 
This summer, McGee ran for the Gators 
track and field team, participated at the USA 
Outdoor Track and Field Championships and 
represented the United States at the 2013 IAAF World Championships held in Moscow. 
And she was taking online classes. 
“I took my classes in Belgium, Austria and 
Russia,” McGee said. 
Although her summer was busy, the experi-
ences McGee brings back to Gainesville should 
prove valuable this season. 
She advanced to the finals at nationals and 
competed among the best at the world champi-onships. 
“When I got to USAs this summer, I felt 
completely comfortable and relaxed,” McGee said. “I wasn’t out of my element. Going into this summer my priority was to make the final (at nationals).” 
She was successful in her attempt. 
Although McGee ran at youth world cham-
pionships in the past, she said there was a 
drastic difference between the youth and adult worlds. 
“They’re not interested in anything you’ve 
done before, because this is the first time that you really are facing off against the greatest in the world,” McGee said of her experience. 
After sustaining an ankle injury last season, 
McGee redshirted her junior year during the women’s Southeastern Conference title run. 
“I was injured two summers ago, the day after my trials, with an ankle,” McGee said. “I 
took a huge break, nearly two months off.”
This summer, her schedule was anything but 
slow. 
“This year was the opposite end of the spec-
trum,” she said. “I took a week off.”
Now, her focus returns to cross country for 
the first time since her sophomore season.
After missing the first 
meet of the season at West-
ern Carolina, McGee will sit out the 2013 Mountain Dew 
Invitational in Gainesville this 
coming Saturday. McGee is set to debut at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational on October 19. 
“I’m just not really ready to go yet,” she said. 
“I would not have made that decision had SECs 
not been here in Gainesville. Knowing that I’ll still get to run in Gainesville this year is what made it OK for me to miss the home meet.”
McGee’s return will be important for the 
Gators. With the departures of seniors Callie Cooper and Florence Ngetich, McGee will be leaned on by her teammates. 
“Callie was always a constant person with 
attitude and work ethic,” McGee said. 
“She was always there for moral support 
and keeping everyone motivated. Florence, on the other hand, was someone who came out 
and worked hard every day and did her thing. 
She set a tone.”
The women hope to repeat last year’s suc-
cess. With McGee back in the fold, 2013 looks promising. 
“I just hope to bring back some of the things 
I learned this summer,” she said. “I’m just try-ing to keep it fun more than anything.”McGee nearing return to Gators  
UF Cross 
Countr yWomen’S goLf“They have great 
chemistry together 
because they not only 
play together in the 11 
v. 11 games, but they’re 
always playing together in 
practice.”
Becky Burleigh
UF coachHowever, Wise added that the 
team needs the beginning of the 
year to continue learning about itself as well as its opponents.
The Gators were served a tough 
offensive lesson Sunday against 
the Nittany Lions.
Gabby Mallette landed more 
attack errors than kills, which gave 
her a game-low -.053 hitting clip. 
Simone Antwi, who was instru-
mental in leading her team past Stanford, couldn’t repeat her suc-cess Sunday as her hitting percent-age dropped from .706 to .133.
Wise said going back-to-back 
days playing elite teams is a tall or-der this early in the season because of how much homework goes into preparing for just one opponent.
“We are asking our players 
to learn this information (and) process this information without the practice time,” Wise said. “All of that makes them have to work harder, but it makes us a better team.”
Since Florida began competing 
in the Nike Big Four Classic, the Gators have made three straight Sweet 16 appearances and one Elite Eight appearance.
Although Wise would have 
preferred a pair of wins over the top-ranked teams in the country, she said she does not focus on the 
win-loss record in a tournament 
this early in the season.
“The win on Saturday does not 
define the weekend nor does the loss on Sunday define the week-end,” Wise said. 
“What defines the weekend is 
what we learned from it and how much better we are moving from this point forward.”
second quarter, Driskel had 
the Gators in the red zone. He evaded the pass rush, stepped 
up in the pocket and threw 
late over the middle for his first interception.
“It was a dumb play,” 
Driskel said. “I should have just taken what the defense gave me. Instead, I tried to make the bigger play. That’s what I’ve got to move on 
from.”
Down 14-9 with 6:57 left 
in the fourth, Driskel took the 
shotgun snap, rolled out and 
fired a pass into the hands 
of Miami cornerback Tracy Howard.
Trey Burton said he ran the 
wrong route and clogged the 
field, which caused the inter-
ception. Driskel said he never should have thrown the pass.  
As for the fumble — the 
quarterback did not stand a chance. 
Disaster struck on a third-
and-7 from Florida’s own 17. Defensive lineman Tyriq Mc-
Cord stripped Driskel and 
recovered his own forced fumble. 
Two plays later, “Seven 
Nation Army” by the White Stripes blared on the sound system, and Miami had a first-and-goal at the 2-yard line.Three plays later, Duke 
Johnson Jr., ran off left tackle, 
headed into the end zone un-
touched and stuck the dagger into Florida’s backs.
“[Driskel] hit some balls 
down the field. I thought he 
did some nice things in the 
run game, but you can’t have the turnovers, especially in the red zone,” coach Will Mus-
champ said. “You can’t make 
those decisions. You can’t. We can’t afford to take points off the board in those situations. That’s such an emotional lift 
for the other team. That just 
can’t happen.”
Three turnovers stained 
a 22-for-33 day for Driskel, 
who established a connection 
with his two top wideouts. He showed an ability to throw the ball down the field with 
his 46-yard completion to Pat-
ton in the first quarter.
The Gators are still behind 
their quarterback. 
Driskel did not immediate-
ly address the team after the game. He showered, spoke with the media, and boarded the bus. 
Like his teammates, Driskel 
wants to move on from a dis-appointing Saturday.
“Jeff is going to be all right. 
He made some tremendous 
throws out there,” receiver 
Quinton Dunbar said. “He just has to watch the film and get better.”Driskel fumbled once, 
threw two interceptions

tweets to Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady 
on air on those quarterbacks’ birthdays? Nope.
Insane popularity does not breed suc-
cess. It usually sets you up for failure.
Even if Tebow did miraculously get 
something out of the Jaguars’ offense, he wouldn’t do much to help a defense with a subpar pass rush and a secondary greener than grass.
During Tebow’s lone season as a 
starter, Matt Prater and a stout Broncos defense repeatedly bailed out a punch-less offense. Expecting a similar formula with the Jaguars this season is ludicrous.
But hey, he might sell a few more 
tickets, so go ahead and bring in a quar-terback no better than Gabbert or Chad Henne but much more polarizing.
Speaking of tickets, Jacksonville’s 96.8 
percent average home capacity in 2012 bested both Green Bay and Pittsburgh.
Maybe they should sign overrated lo-cal favorites with little to offer.
If Tebow really does offer a poten-
tial attendance boost, why shouldn’t the 
former Gator join the Tampa Bay Bucca-
neers or the Miami Dolphins?
Both franchises failed to outdraw a 
2-14 Jaguars squad last season.
A bad team in one of the NFL’s small-
est media markets averaged 64,984 fans per game. The Fins averaged 57,379, and the Bucs averaged 55,102.
And Jacksonville is the NFL team in 
Florida with an attendance problem? Give me a break.
Adding a quarterback who cannot 
possibly live up to the hype that accom-panies him is simply a bad investment.
The only way to fix the Jaguars is to 
build a strong, consistent winner. 
Signing Tebow would only ham-
per the rebuilding process. Thankfully, 
Caldwell and owner Shad Khan know 
that.
Tebow will not be a Jaguar. Stop per-
petuating an overblown and ridiculous myth. Just stop.joe , from page 13

         With Week 1 of the 2013 NFL sea-
son ﬁ  nished, here are a few former Gators who are making the most tangible impact for their respective teams.    Caleb Sturgis, kicker: Caleb 
Sturgis’ performance against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday reaf-ﬁ  rmed the Miami Dolphins’ deci-sion to release veteran Dan Carpen-ter in favor of the rookie. Sturgis was perfect at FirstEnergy Stadium, going 3 for 3 and connecting from 36, 45 and 49 yards. Sturgis is one of seven NFL kickers to make three or more ﬁ  eld goal attempts in Week 1. His 49-yard ﬁ  eld goal stands as the third-longest after a week of play. 
    Ray McDonald, defensive end: 
Ray McDonald’s contract extension in 2011 continues to pay dividends for the San Francisco 49ers — one of 
the league’s deepest teams. 
  In Sunday’s 34-28 victory, Mc-
Donald combined for four tackles 
and split a sack with teammate Al-don Smith as the 49ers’ defensive front manhandled the Packers, hold-ing Mike McCarthy’s team to just 63 yards on the ground and forcing two costly turnovers. 
  McDonald has been a stout ﬁ  ve-
technique left defensive end in the 49ers base 3-4 defense for more than two seasons. He is a huge, long-armed run-stuffer, and much of that was evident on Sunday as the Pack-ers failed to gain any push or lever-age in their run game. 
    Maurkice Pouncey, center: In 
a division of outstanding interior defensive lineman, the Pittsburgh Steelers lost All-Pro center Maurkice Pouncey — one of the team’s most valuable performers — after one week of play. 
Pouncey suffered tears to both 
his ACL and MCL against the Ten-nessee Titans on Sunday and will 
miss the remainder of the 2013 sea-
son. The success and failure of the Steelers in the last few seasons has been spoiled by its inability to pro-tect Ben Roethlisberger and its lack of a formidable run game. 
The Steelers managed just 32 
yards versus the Titans on Sunday — third fewest in an opener since 
World War II. 
In four seasons with the Steelers, 
Pouncey has started in all but three 
games.

� UF HAS THREE FRESHMEN.
  ERICA A. HERNANDEZ
 Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa
   Coach Roland Thornqvist’s 
women’s tennis team brought 
in three freshmen during the 
offseason.
Thornqvist was clear when 
he spoke about their roles on 
Monday. 
  “We’re going to take all 
three of them this weekend to 
Duke to see what we can do up there,” he said. 
  The newcomers — Kourt-
ney Keegan of Roswell, Ga., and Australians Stefani Stojic and Belinda Woolcock — will begin their college careers on 
Friday at the Duke Invitation-
al in Durham, N.C. 
  Woolcock is the No. 7 fresh-
man in the nation, according 
to the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association. 
The three make up more 
than one-third of the Gators’ 
roster.
  “That [created] a little bit 
of uncertainty over the sum-mer,” Thornqvist said. 
  But during Saturday and 
Sunday’s ﬁ  rst preseason prac-tices of the year, Thornqvist’s worries were quieted.
  “All three freshman are 
doing everything we ask,” Thornqvist said. “We’ve con-ditioned OK. We’re getting used to the heat, which is not easy.”  By bringing the freshman 
to Durham for the three-day singles and doubles invita-tional, Thornqvist hopes to see his inexperienced group continue to improve. 
  “It’s hard for us to have any 
goals as far as performance is concerned,” he said. “I know we can hit the ball and I know we have the talent, but I’m not so sure we can put it all to-gether just yet.”
  Thornqvist will be looking 
to his three returning seniors to help make that happen. 
  “We lost obviously a great 
leader from last year’s team in Lauren Embree,” he said, “but the three seniors we have in this year’s team have been part of probably the best three-year run in this program’s his-tory.
  “So we’re going to rely 
obviously on Olivia (Janow-icz), Alex (Cercone) and Soﬁ  e (Oyen) for their leadership.” 
  Florida’s three new faces 
won’t be the only change on display at Duke. Thornqvist noted the move towards more offensive strength compared to past squad’s defensive pa-tience.
  “We’re a hitting team this 
year,” he said. 
“We actually prefer to hit 
the ball and we may be the kind of team this year who will push the action on our opponents.”  Freshmen critical to
