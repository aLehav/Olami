Alligator Contributing Writer
UF residence halls have
been participating in a friend-
ly fight for the environment.
The halls are involved in an
annual eco-challenge compe-
tition, which began Jan. 4 and
encourages students living
in dorms to conserve water,
reduce energy consumption
and reduce waste.
"The main thing is to pro-
mote environmental aware-
ness," said Bo Chulawan, the
director of the challenge. "We
want students to feel they can
make an impact, no matter
how big or how small."
The competition ends
April 21 during the campusEarth Day celebration, when
one residence hall will be pro-
claimed the winner.
To win the challenge, a
residence hall must show the
biggest improvement in en-
ergy savings per resident. The
improvement is measured
by comparing the results of
this year's competition with
the those of last
On year's competi-Campus tion.
C hu law an
said prizes for the most sus-
tainable residence hall will
include a trophy made from
recycled material and items
to make the hall even "green-
er," including infrared light
switches.
The challenge has different
contests for different months.

UF, faculty union reach long-awaited agreement
It covers teacher salaries, intellectual property
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
After five years of negotiations, UF's
Board of Trustees and the United Faculty
of Florida at UF have reached an agree-
ment that will create a transparent set of
rights and responsibilities for faculty in
the workplace.
Paul Ortiz, associate professor of his-
tory at UF and member of the United Fac-
ulty of Florida, said the agreement helps
resolve ongoing concerns related to teach-
er salaries and sabbaticals.
Sabbaticals are leaves of absence in
which professors teach or conduct research
outside of the university.
The agreement also discusses intel-
lectual property rights related to online
course materials.Once the contract related to the agree-
ment is ratified, both the administration
and the faculty must honor it, Ortiz said.
John Biro, the president of the United
Faculty of Florida at UF, said the contract
between UF and the UFF is still being re-
viewed by both parties.
Biro said the union is pleased with the
agreement and that it has been a difficult
debate for all parties.
"It's been good for everybody and very
bad for everybody," he said.
Biro said the union aims to have the
agreement ratified by mid-February, and
he hopes the Board will ratify around the
same time.
Student Government President Jordan
Johnson, who is on the Board of the Trust-
ees, said details of the agreement still need
to be finalized.
"I would just say that I'm glad that there"We will now move to the next
steps in the collective bargaining
process which would include the
ratification of the contract terms
by the UFF members and the UF
Board of Trustees."
Steve Orlando
UF spokesman
was an agreement reached," he said.
The road to agreement has not been
easy.
According to Biro, the negotiations
have lasted so long not only because of
disagreements but also because the deci-
sion-making is part of a naturally lengthy
process.
"It is a long, complicated agreement -
almost 40 articles," he said.Biro said that in mid-December, a
breakdown in negotiations nearly led to
an impasse hearing.
In an impasse hearing, a neutral third
party, known as a special magistrate,
would hear the statements of both sides.
The pressure of an impending hearing
forced both parties to reach a tentative
agreement and resume negotiations, Biro
said.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said UF
is satisfied with the agreement.
"We are very pleased to announce that
the University of Florida and the United
Faculty of Florida (UFF) have reached
an agreement on a new contract, thereby
avoiding an impasse hearing," Orlando
said.
"We will now move to the next steps in
the collective bargaining process, which
would include the ratification of the con-
tract terms by the UFF members and the
UF Board of Trustees."

Resumes get revamp
* ABOUT 50 STUDENTS
ATTENDED TUESDAY.
By REBECCA DEELY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students didn't need a suit or a
pair of heels for the interviews at
Ace the Showcase Tuesday night.
The program, hosted by the
Warrington Diplomats, gave stu-
dents the chance to participate
in mock job interviews and have
their resumes and cover letters
critiqued in an informal setting.
The event was held in Stuzin
Hall from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.
About 50 students, mostly
business majors, attended to
prepare for the upcoming career
showcase on Jan. 19 and 20.
Matt Tringali, president of the
Warrington Diplomats, said stu-
dents need the most help with theinterviewing process.
"A lot of students don't get
any interviewing experience un-
til after they leave the college set-
ting." Tringali said.
Tringali said the mock inter-
views lasted between 20 minutes
and 30 minutes per student.
At least 10 stu-
0On dents had mock in-
Campus terviews.
The questions
came off a list com-
piled by the student diplomats
who have been interviewed be-
fore.
They picked the questions they
found to be the most common
and challenging during their own
interviewing experiences.
Taylor Schalk, a UF sopho-
more, said the hardest part of the
interviewing is the timing.
"You really have to be ready
right on the spot." Schalk said.Copyrighted Material

Toxic chemical taints some Claire's, Wal-mart jewelry
Friendship bracelets, charms included.
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students might want to think twice be-
fore buying some budget bling.
Since Mattel recalled nearly 1 million toys
in August 2007 after they were found to be
laced with lead, some Chinese manufacturers
have been substituting the toxic heavy metal
cadmium in low-cost jewelry.
An Associated Press investigation showed
several Chinese-manufactured jewelry pieces
contained cadmium levels of up to 91 percent
by weight, according to the AP article.
Lab testing performed for the AP also re-
vealed some items shed the substance easily,
increasing concern for the effects of cadmiumexposure, especially in children and young
adults, who are more susceptible to cadmi-
um's effects.
Cadmium, the seventh most-hazardous
substance in the environment, according to
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, can cause severe liver and kidney
problems, said David Barber, associate profes-
sor at UF's Center for Environmental and Hu-
man Toxicology.
"Cadmium has been recognized as a toxic
metal for many years," he said. "I was quite
surprised when I heard it wasn't something
that was paid much attention to."
Some of the jewelry with high levels of cad-
inum was sold at Claire's and Wal-Mart, the
AP investigation revealed.The tainted jewelry included two charms
for a "best friends" bracelet sold by Claire's
and three flip-flop-shaped bracelet charms
available at Wal-Mart, according to the AP.
Claire's issued a statement announcing it
would discontinue the sale of thebraceletoutof
caution, although the company has no reason
to believe the product is unsafe. The company
requires that all merchandise
National pass tests at a lab approved by
News the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
A statement issued by Wal-Mart an-
nounced the company would remove all items
identified in recent cadmium-related media
reports from its shelves.
Wal-Mart is also conducting its own inves-
tigation and is cooperating with the CPSC's
current investigation.
Sonia Hayes Pleasant, spokeswoman forthe CPSC, said shoppers should avoid buying
such products at this time.
"There's no way a parent can determine if
a piece of metal jewelry contains any kind of
metal, including cadmium," she said.
Cadmium, which is naturally found in
soils and is used in some plastics, is restricted
in some items such as painted toys but not in
jewelry, according to the AP.
After lead became strictly regulated by the
Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act
of 2008, manufacturers began searching for al-
ternatives as the price of cadmium dropped.
A safer substitute for cadmium is zinc,
which is the most-cited metal for lead replace-
ment in jewelry imported to the U.S. for sale.
"Cadmium is one of the nastier heavy met-
als that are out there," Barber said. "It can
have a lot of effects depending on how largely
you're exposed.

0 THE PROJECT PAIRS STUDENTS
WITH SEDENTARY SENIORS.
By CJ Pruner
Alligator Writer
cpruner@alligator org
Michael Norman refuses to let his age
control his life.
At 60 years old, Norman carries more
enthusiasm than one would expect from
someone his age, but he admits he lives a
rather sedentary lifestyle.
"I'm sitting all day long," he said. "I
need to get more active."
Enter Walking Buddies, a program de-
signed to help people like Norman get out
and moving one day a week for 12 weeks.
According to Stacey Bright, a senior inju-
ry awareness specialist with the Brain Inju-ry Association of Florida Inc., the program
will help in preventing falls for senior citi-
zens and help them foster intergenerational
relationships with students.
She also hopes that the program will
help students gain experience in develop-
ing personal skills that could help them in
their interaction with future patients.
"It's really a win-win for both parties,"
Bright said.
Initially launched at the University of
North Florida in 2006, Walking Buddies is
the first such project in Gainesville.
Once the program begins the week of
January 25, enrolled senior citizens must
attend 10 of the 12 sessions. Students may
walk with up to five participants during the
sessions.
Students with health-related majors in-
terested in participating in the program
should e-mail Craig Fox at foxca@shands.

WEATHER
Sales fall with degrees
By CLARE LENNON "We know that when it warms up and
Alligator Contributing Writer spring rolls around, that's when everybody's
coming," he said.
It might not come as a surprise to shiver-
ing Gators that the recent cold snap is freezing
business for some of Gainesville's hot spots.
The chill has interrupted the typical warm-
weather routine that makes up the majority of
many businesses' income.
Mandi Navaro, owner of Golden Gator
Tanning, said this winter has been especially
bad for business.
"I still have my regulars who don't go
without a tan, but less people are coming in,"
she said.
The weather has also impacted business
for The Swamp Restaurant. While the res-
taurant has multiple indoor rooms and a bar,
outdoor seating is also frequently used.
"When it gets really, really, really cold,
you've got to seat the same customers in half
the space," said events and office manager
Kathleen Williams. "We do it fairly well, but
it's a challenge."
Yogaberry, a popular frozen yogurt shop
that replaced Deji Brew this fall, is using the
weather to its advantage to promote its lesser-
known coffee products.
"The other sales have taken a hit with these
crazy temperatures," manager Kyle Turner
said about recent frozen yogurt sales.
Turner added he was not surprised by the
sales that dropped along with the tempera-
ture.Starting Monday, Turner said Yogaberry
will offer $1 coffees and $2 lattes to cater to
chilled students on a college budget.
However, other stores that cater more
strictly to the frozen-treat crowd must pursue
a different strategy than coffee.
"When it gets really, really, really
cold, you've got to seat the same
customers in half the space. We do
it fairly well, but it's a challenge."
Kathleen Williams
The Swamp Restaurant events and office
manager
Michael Herbert, assistant manager of
TCBY on Southwest 34th Street, said the ice
cream chain sees a decrease in sales every
year with the cold weather.
"This year has been a little slower, but
there's also a decrease probably because of
the increase in competition," he said.
Herbert also said TCBY is offering daily
specials, but for the most part, the company
plans to wait for the cold to pass.
Herbert added the frozen yogurt business
usually picks back up around spring break,
when students can trade in fur boots for flip-
flops and scarves for sunglasses.W, , , P ,% H .,9

Just do it
Senators should allow
students to vote on fee
he Editorial Board would like to encourage Student
Government senators to do the right thing. Just this
one time. Please.
We may have spent years berating you and constantly
pointing out your faults, but we're happy to take your side
on an issue as hotly debated as the Reitz Union student
fee. That is if you actually put the students first and allow
a referendum question to appear on the spring ballot.
We here at the Alligator are in complete support of hav-
ing students vote on whether they support the $20 flat fee
and $3 per credit hour.
We understand some of you want a big, fancy new
student union. (However, $56 million is a good chunk of
change.) We also understand that even with the new fee,
our tuition would still be substantially lower than most
colleges.
And don't worry, graduate students. We haven't for-
gotten about your problems with the fee either.
We know all of this, but we still believe that the stu-
dents (you know, the ones who voted for you to represent
them) who will be paying for this fee should have a say,
because isn't that the point of democracy?
However, don't just put the question on the ballot and
then toss the results to the side (handscanners at South-
west Recreation Center, anyone?)
Listen to the opinions of UF students or, at the very
least, pretend to take their opinions into consideration.
And students: It the senators are so kind as to give you
the power to vote on the fee, please don't disappoint us by
not showing up to the polls come Feb. 23 and Feb. 24.
Payhack
Google announcedMonday that it will
stop censoring Web
content on its Chinese site
after the Gmail accounts of
human rights activists were
hacked, and the Editorial
Board thinks it's about time.
While they didn't come
right out and say it, a
Google blog post hints that
the attack came from within
China's government.
In 2006, with the de-
velopment of Google.cn,
Google agreed to censor
content the Chinese govern-
ment deemed objectionable
-a surprising step that
threatened the freedom of
Chinese citizens.
While the Editorial Board
feels that Google made a
mistake in ever agreeing to
censor the search results onits page, we acknowledge
that the company is making
the right decision now.
In its blog post, Google
also notes that cutting cen-
sorship might not be the
only repercussion of the
snafu -Google may re-
think business operations
with China altogether,
which we think would be
both the right decision and
a truly ballsy move.
According to Forbes.
com, China passed the U.S.
in Internet users in 2006 -
just around the time Google
made its deal with China.
We realize how much reve-
nue China brings to Google,
and we respect the compa-
ny for putting people first
-above money.
We only wish they did it
three years ago.

Census questions display ignorance
hen I saw a link for the spanking new "raceand ethnicity" guidelines from the U.S.
Census Bureau plastered across the ISIS
homepage, I had to check it out.
The first time I took the FCAT, I had a fit. I demanded
to know why I had not been provided with a "multira-
cial" box to tick.
Racial diversity at my school meant three black stu-
dents, a half-Korean kid and me, so my guidance coun-
selor was a tad unprepared. I insisted I should check
two boxes -I couldn't play favorites with my parents.
She said no.
The new census is an improvement if only in that
you can check more than one box. There are two ques-
tions, each with its own list of answers and politically
correct disclaimers.
The first addresses whether you are Hispanic. It
states: "The above part of the question is about ethnic-
ity, not race," so whether you are black, white or blue, if
you're from Central or South America, you're hispanic.
Yes, Cubans and Puerto Ricans as well. Question
done, now let's move onto race.
As an anthro student, I word-vomit "social con-
struct" as soon as I hear the word race.
As far as I'm aware, the U.S. government didn't en-
slave or abuse any of my ancestors, so I don't really see
a reason the government needs to know with which
group I would rather associate myself.
What purpose does a racial category serve in the cen-
sus?
As one of my professors was told when he asked this
question during his time as one of the census's "expert
consultants": It's the law.Lily Burns The instructions are to choose
Speaking Out one or more from the following
racial groups. These groups are
as follows: American Indian or
Alaska native, Asian, black or African American, native
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and white.
Each choice comes with a paragraph defining the cat-
egory and they use the phrase "a person having origins
in" a lot.
I get the feeling that anthropological know-how is
becoming hip in the politically correct world in which
the current administration lives.
So what I think they were trying to demonstrate was
some race consciousness. The intended question should
probably have been written: Where in the hey did your
ancestors live before colonialism went and redrew the
continent of Africa?
It's a questionnaire written by somebody who prob-
ably wasn't there the day their anthropology, sociol-
ogy, biology or anatomy professor talked about human
variation.
And it's a section of the questionnaire I'll be skip-
ping. Thank you, UF and ISIS, but I don't feel like stand-
ing up and being counted. I have my passports.
You know which countries they are from. That
should be plenty.
Whether or not it's officially recognized, race is an is-
sue. As long as populations with recognizable physical
differences interact, it will always be an issue.
Prescribing racial categories doesn't help. What does
help is treating every individual as a human being and
not just a number.

W4. tIPolitics hard to parody
hen Time Magazine de-clared the age of irony
dead following the Sept.
11 attacks, its conclusion was right,
even if it was working from faulty
premises.
Time foresaw the Clinton-era zeit-
geist of a lackadaisical global hege-
mony being replaced by a new age
of sobering national purpose. There
would be no more cynicism among
the people, and certainly no more of
that sociopathic opportunism among
our leaders. How could there be?
Of course, we now know that
plans to focus public outrage away
from the actual culprits behind Sept.
11 and toward the unrelated goal of
controlling Iraq began literally hours
after the worst terrorist attacks in
American history, with the twisted
wreckage of the World Trade Center
still billowing asbestos-laced ash, the
acrid smoke only temporarily veiling
a forever-altered New York City sky-
line. So Time got that one wrong.
But one element of irony has in-
deed been on life support in recent
years -political satire. Not because
we've all become angels; just the op-
posite. Events have become so outra-
geous that it's becoming harder to ef-
fect a decent parody anymore.
It began before Sept. 11 -the
purest example being the Clinton im-
peachment farce -but has steadily
gathered steam in the past decade.
In 2004, at a White House corre-
spondent's dinner, President Bush
participated in a skit where he was
"looking around the White House"
for the weapons of mass destruction
we never found in Iraq. Trillions of
dollars and tens of thousands of lives
lost, and Bush -and the press corps
-was having a laugh about it. How
do you parody that?
Guantanamo Bay. Torture. Rendi-
tion. The surveillance state. These are
the things of Orwellian nightmares,
and yet they've all come to pass -in
most cases with widespread public
acceptance. Satire works through the
use of exaggeration, but how do you
improve upon a scenario like snatch-
ing a person up without explanation,
taking him to a strange country, in-
flicting uponhimcontinuous physical

refusing to

Things have only gotten worse
since Obama was elected. Recently,
I saw a sign being proudly waved at
one of those tea party protests com-
plaining about Obama. I honestly
couldn't tell if the middle-aged, gray-
haired man holding it was serious or
just slyly commenting on the clown
show taking place around him.
It's hard for me to even keep up
with the talking points each week.
To hear some tell it, Obama is an elit-
ist, overly intellectual know-nothing
who's so thoughtful and nuanced
that he's all rhetoric and no substance.
He's a radical Christian-Muslim ter-
rorist sleeper-agent who calls Osama
bin Laden Sundays after church.
He's certainly the most stridently
socialist ironman since Stalin even
though he doesn't have any kind
of real power and is just being con-
trolled by his suspiciously Semitic
advisers. And just for good measure,
he's probably sleeping with all the
nation's young white women even
though he's a black supremacist who
is agitating for the Afro-revolution.
It's impossible to parody. And the
fact is, it's becoming impossible to ig-
nore this growing community of fel-
low travelers that is completely un-
tethered from what was once called
consensus reality.
They believe what they want to
believe -whether it's that health care
reform is akin to Nazi death camps or
that global climate change is really a
worldwide conspiracy of scientists
out for research grants -because
it fits their preconceived ideological
comm-itments. To these mostly old,
mostly white, mostly insane people,
there are no truths, only interpreta-
tions. Empiricism has become an
obstacle to be overcome rather than a
philosophy to be embraced.
It's scary. And it's going to get
worse before it gets better.

Senate stalls fee vote
By ELIZABETH BEHRIMAN
Alligator Writer
The Reitz Union has been around
for more than 40 years, but for Student
Government senators, discussions
about its renovation and expansion
never get old.
Senators voted Tuesday night to
postpone voting on a bill that would
add a question about the Reitz Union
expansion fee to the spring Student
Government election ballot.
The question, which consists of two
parts, will allow students to express
whether the fee should be implement-
ed, and if it is, whether it should be
used to cover expansion as well as the
repairs in the Reitz Union.
Senate President Ashton Charles,
a member of the Unite Party, said the
vote is being postponed so that several
student organizations and the Reitz
Union Board of Managers can review
the legislation.Charles, one of the sponsors of the
bill, said students have attended fo-
rums about the fee and deserve the op-
portunity to review a bill related to it.
"It is something that everyone has
been working really hard on, and we
owe them the chance to see it and have
their input," Charles said.
Charles said postponing the vote on
the bill may not change the legislation
at all.Student She said thereGovernment will still be time to
put the question on
the ballot for the upcoming elections.
"We've already set the precedent
for communicating with people and
we're being consistent with the poli-
cy," Charles said
Although the vote is being post-
poned, Charles said the Unite Party is
pleased with the compromise senators
reached with members of the Orange
and Blue Party and the Progress Party
while they were drafting the bill.Halls to host environmental events
CHALLENGE, from page 1
reducing the amount of water usage per
resident, February's contest focuses on
waste reduction, and March and April's
contest focuses on recycling efforts.
Robby Perreault, a sophomore indus-
trial and systems engineering major and
a Thomas Hall resident assistant, said
the hall's walls are decorated with post-
ers. Bulletin boards are to raise awareness
about shower timers installed in the hall's
bathrooms, he said.
The timers serve to remind students to
take shorter, cooler showers to save water.
Leah Zigelsky, a UF freshman who lives
in Jennings Hall, said the challenge has also
encouraged her to recycle.
"I've definitely realized a lot more ways
that I can make changes in my routines,
which would help this cause a lot," Zigel-
sky said.
The group's Facebook page also said the
challenge awards individual students for
any extra efforts they make toward being
more eco-friendly.
They may be awarded for using reus-
able to-go boxes from Gator Dining, forexample.
Britany Ziems, the eco-challenge rep-
resentative for Reid Hall, Yulee Hall and
Mallory Hall, said the halls will host events
to help promote environmental awareness.
"The main thing is to promote
environmental awareness. We want
students to feel they can make an
impact, no matter how big or how
small."
Bo Chulawan
IRHA spokesman
Ziems said snacks will be served and
Wall-E will be shown at the Yulee Hall
basement Thursday.
She said she wants to encourage stu-
dents in a relaxed way rather than hosting
formal speaking engagements.
"We want to get our message across by
having fun, not [by] boring people," said
Zeims.

Guard play too much for UF to handle
* ERIC BLEDSOE AND JOHN WALL COM-
BINED FOR 44 POINTS.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a be rry@alligato r org
Freshman phenom John Wall received the major-
ity of the pregame hype, but it was his fellow fresh-
man guard who stole the show Tuesday night.
Eric Bledsoe scored 25 points, grabbed seven
rebounds and dished out five assists, leading No.
2 Kentucky to an 89-77 win against Florida in the
O'Connell Center.
The Gators (11-5) kept it close throughout, tying it
up with 5:14 remaining in the game, but the Wildcats
(17-0) prevailed thanks to a balanced inside-outside
game and an impressive performance by Bledsoe,
who more than doubled his average of 10.3 points
per game.
"We put a lot of attention on Wall, and Bledsoe
ended up hurting us," said sophomore point guard
Erving Walker, who led UT with 20 points. "We gave
him some open looks that he shouldn't have had, but
he just made plays. I've got to give him credit -he
made plays." PI
UT managed to keep the game within striking
distance for much of the second half due largely to
the efforts of Walker (20 points) and junior power for-
ward Alex Tyus (17).
The Gators got off to a strong start, holding Ken-
tucky to just four points in the opening eight minutes
and crashing the defensive glass in a way they had

Gators trying to find starting lineup
By EUGENIO TORRENS

The starting lineup for the Gators went
from a who's-who hodgepodge to a con-
sistent starting five that, above all, brings
one thing to the Southeastern Conference
schedule.
And that is experience.
The current starting lineup for the
Gators (Sharielle Smith, Azania Stewart,
Steffi Sorensen, Jordan Jones and Lon-
nika Thompson) boasts five players who
all have prior SEC experience, including
transfer Jones who sat out last year but
was thrust into a starting role her fresh-man year against conference foes as a
point guard for South Carolina.
It hasn't been that way all season. Coach
Amanda Butler has shuffled the starting
lineup and has trotted out six different
combinations throughout the season.
"To be honest with you, it's not
really set."
Sharielle Smith
UF senior forward
The most effective of those lineups has
been the current one that holds a 5-3 record
and has remained consistant the last sevengames, including the three SEC games this
season (2-1 record in those games).
But that doesn't mean they are guaran-
teed anything.
"To be honest with you, it's not really
set," Smith said. "It has been consistent
the last couple of games, but I don't think
it's set.
"Everybody knows if you, individu-
ally, if you don't set the tone in one game
or you don't have necessarily some of
your best play, there is an opportunity for
other people to step up and take your po-
sition."

Coach Cal's best friend is given
simple orders: Push the ball up the
court as fast as you can and as far
as you can.
Look first for an easy lay-in for
yourself. If that's not there, a quick
pass for a layup or dunk. And if
all else fails, kick it back out for an
open jump shot, or reset the of-
fense from there.
The third option is not usuallyneeded.
I wouldn't be shocked to learn
that the Wildcats don't practice
with a ball. Wall and Eric Bledsoe,
who went off for 25 points against
the Gators, probably just lead the
team out to the track where they
run sprints for two hours.
"When Wall's coming up the
floor 100 miles per hour, Bledsoe is
resting and when Bledsoe is com-
ing up the floor, Wall is resting,"
UF coach Billy Donovan said.
"So it's kind of like a two-headed
monster the way they come at you
off the dribble."
Off of every missed shot, Ken-
tucky got out and ran.

Gators unable to match up with Wildcats' frontcourt in the post

that cut the lead to one.
From there, the game turned into a run-and-gun affair, with
both teams racing down the floor for points in transition. The
style played perfectly into UK's hand, and the Wildcats' athleti-
cism was on full display as they pulled ahead 38-31 by the end
of the first half and never trailed for the rest of the game.
"I think the speed and size and length after a period of time
starts to wear our guys down justbecause of our lack of depth,"Donovan said.
Men's
BasketballIn the opening 20 minutes, the Gators
showed no signs of picking up their three-
point shooting where they left off against
Vanderbilt, but they found an unlikely
weapon from the outside in Tyus.
Tyus, who had only attempted one three
this season prior to Tuesday, hit his first two
of the season before halftime.
UF hit only one other three in the opening 20 minutes -abank shot by freshman guard Kenny Boynton with less than a
minute remaining. The Gators shot better in the second half but
finished at just 38 percent from the field and 30 percent from
three-point range.
UF also struggled to stop UK's post players, as forward
Patrick Patterson scored 15 and DeMarcus Cousins added 13.
With Cousins in foul trouble throughout the game, UK coach
John Calipari turned to freshman forward Daniel Orton, who
scored just two points but grabbed nine rebounds and had four
huge blocks.
UF leans on Smith to provide rebounding presence

ten for the Gators, and Florida's start-
ing five isn't the most athletic or domi-
nant rotation, but the one thing Smith
seemed to associate with these starters
was a high basketball IQ.
"This would be our smartest line-
up," she said. "It's not necessarily
about who's quicker on defense, it's
more about who's smarter on defense.
The starting lineup out thinks a lot of
other starting lineups."
Generally, that starts with the point
guard. Thompson set a career high in
steals (seven) against Ohio on Dec. 28.
Thompson running the point has
allowed Jones to move back to her
natural shooting guard position. Jones
leads the team in scoring, assists and
steals.
A smaller front court featuring
Stewart as the only player taller than 6
feet, at 6 foot 4, has been managed by
Smith, Stewart and Sorensen.
Smith leads the team in rebounding
with 7.3 boards per game and Stewart
has improved her play over winter
break, boosting her scoring and re-
bounding averages.
The toughness instilled in the play-
ers by Butler makes the others, besides
Stewart, a rebounding threat despite
their lack of size.
"We're willing to all scrap and bat-
tle and fight for every loose rebound,"
Sorensen said. "A big amount of pride
of the first four minutes is the state-
ment you make: you either get hit in
the face, or you hit the other team in
the face."UF forward Sharielle Smith dribbles the ball down the court during the Gators'
71-68 double overtime win against Auburn in the O'Connell Center on Jan. 7.KYLE, from page 14
The Wildcats big men gave the ball up
quickly to the speedy Wall and Bledsoe, and
they did the rest.
It's worth noting that perhaps the best
-certainly the quickest -backcourt in the
nation is comprised of two freshmen. Two
freshmen who look like they've been run-
ning fast breaks for as long as they could
dribble a basketball.
As good as Kentucky's high-speed offen-
sive attack is, I wasn't sold on its defense.
If the Gators could have shot better than
30 percent in the first half, the result would
have been totally different.
Donovan has UF committed on the de-
fensive end, and the improvement is notice-
able. But without Nick Calathes, it doesn't
appear that the Gators have a way of gen-
erating easy baskets the way Kentucky does
with Wall and Bledsoe.
Walker turned in an admirable perfor-
mance -20 points -but got little help
from anyone besides Alex Tyus, who hit two
threes with the shot clock winding down,
dumped in 17 points and was the only UF
big man not to run and hide from Patrick
Patterson and DeMarcus Cousins.
The game looked up in the air with as few
as five minutes remaining, but the Wildcats'
wild dogs had one last finishing push at the
end of the marathon.
When Walker almost single-handedly
brought back the Gators with his 16 second-
half points, Bledsoe hit a three from the
wing to extend the lead to six points and
Wall made the play of the game, blocking
Boynton off the glass from behind on a
runout before sinking four free throws to
ice the game.
As it turns out, Calipari's beasts also
have a little greyhound in them.( 61%46% ()f Pi.100f .1bu%#6 .1
