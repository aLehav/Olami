An image ﬂ  ashes on screen.
It’s three smiling teenagers 
dressed for prom.
Christian Aguilar is on the left, 
wearing a white tuxedo. Erika Fri-
man is in the middle, in a blood-red, 
ﬂ  oor-length dress. Pedro Bravo is on the right, in a black tuxedo.
The photo was taken of three 
friends during their senior year at Doral Academy, a charter school in Miami. At the time, the photo was shared on Facebook. Now, it’s shared with a jury.
Christian Aguilar, a UF student, 
was reported missing on Sept. 21, 2012, and his remains were found in a shallow grave in Levy County 22 
days later.
The State of Florida has accused 
Pedro Bravo, a former Santa Fe Col-
lege student, of the murder, among a slew of other charges. It is not seek-ing the death penalty.
The trial began Monday, in court-
room 1B in the Alachua County Courthouse Criminal Justice Center. The state began its opening state-ment with that photo and continued with what it assumes are the events for that night and the weeks leading up to it. 
The last time Aguilar was seen 
alive, he was at Best Buy on Archer Road with his estranged high school friend, Bravo. They were buying the latest Kanye West CD. In the secu-rity footage, they are both smiling.
The pair met to discuss Bravo’s 
depression and suicidal thoughts, both the defense and prosecution 
agree.
What they disagree on is what 
happened afterward.VOLUME 108 ISSUE 167 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG THURSDAY, AUGUST 7, 2014

Keith Stegath is fed up with 
politicians and lawyers making 
decisions they are not qualiﬁ  ed 
for.
That’s why the 57-year-old 
UF alumnus decided he isn’t 
going to sit around any longer. 
He’s now taking action by run-
ning in the Florida 2014 guber-natorial elections in November as a write-in candidate. 
Stegath, who has a bach-
elor’s degree in electrical engi-neering and a masters in me-chanical engineering, said one of his biggest issues is that the state — and nation — needs more engineers in public ofﬁ  ce.  
“We’re in the 21st century, 
but the country is in the 20th century because of  politicians today,” Stegath said. “The peo-
ple we’re electing do not under-
stand the decisions they have to make on the technologies they don’t understand.” 
He cites that the U.S. used to 
have a 15-year technology lead on other countries, and now, that number is down to about a ﬁ  ve-year lead.
Stegath, running as an In-
dependent, said another thing he would like to accomplish as governor is to decriminalize marijuana in the state. He’s op-posed to fully legalizing it and 
insists a small ﬁ  ne for public 
use would beneﬁ  t both parties: lawmakers and users. 
“Sure, you’re going to get a 
lot of great pot from legalizing 
it, but there’s a lot of govern-
ment overhead,” he said. 
Because Stegath is running 
as a write-in candidate, voters are going to have to do exactly 
that: write a name on their bal-
lot, wrote UF professor Stephen Craig in an email. 
“Basically, write-in candi-
dates are protest (or vanity) candidates,” Craig said. “They almost never have much mon-ey, voters don’t know who they are, and their prospects of win-
ning are negligible.”  
But that isn’t stopping Ste-
gath, who is currently self-
ﬁ  nancing and solely running 
his campaign. He even built his UF alumnus enters

Holly Perez received an email from the University Bursar 
this week saying that her direct deposit sign-up information to 
receive ﬁ  nancial aid was electronically deleted in error.
About 3,900 students also received this email.UF’s Student Financial Affairs accidently deleted student 
deposit accounts on July 11 while routinely cleaning up stu-dent records. The accounts are currently restored and in the process of being veriﬁ  ed.  “When I got the email, I was frustrated,” 
22-year-old Perez wrote in an email. “Receiv-ing that the ﬁ  rst week of medical school when so much is already going on just added to my stress.”
Students were asked to verify that their 
deposit account information is correct on 
their myUFL page and deactivate their ac-count to create a new one if their information needs to be changed or updated.
Ruth Harris, a Bursar associate controller, said she has not yet encountered any students with accounts restored incorrectly.
“Some students are not here for the Summer and not in the 
mood for returning to school yet,” Harris said. “We really want to hear if they see anything wrong.”
This kind of error has never happened before, but Kim 
Simpson, who works in the Ofﬁ  ce of the Vice President and 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ  cer, said it was a pretty normal course of 
business.
“The only inconvenience is we asked students to look at

Stumbling the streets for Gator 
Stompin’ pub crawl has been a 
Gainesville tradition for 32 years.
But overspending on this year’s 
Gator Stompin’ may have cost the event its 33rd year — unless Jason Bowman can come up with a solu-
tion, and fast.
“The debt is mine and Pledge 
5’s. We’re working to eliminate 
that,” said Bowman, director of Pledge 5 Foundation, the volun-
teer service organization that has 
hosted Gator Stompin’ for the past nine years.
Due to an unforeseen drop in 
thrift store sales and an overpriced concert, Pledge 5 owes multiple employees and nearly 80 bars and restaurants various amounts — anywhere from $100 to $10,000 
— for their participation in Gator 
Stompin’ this May.
Frustrated and without pay, 
some disgruntled employees have 
quit. Pledge 5 is currently fac-
ing two lawsuits in small claims court.
Former thrift store manager 
Emily Sacco, who ﬁ  led one of the 
lawsuits on July 28, said Bowman 
owes her four months of pay.
“I didn’t make a dime,” she 
said.
Sacco began working for Pledge 5 as the manager of the University Avenue Pledge 5 thrift 
store, Thrift 5, a year and a half 
ago, and she was managing all three Pledge 5 thrift stores when she left in July.
This is the ﬁ  rst year Pledge 5 
has funded Gator Stompin’ with thrift shop funds, Bowman said.
“We were in the process of 
opening the third store while put-
ting on Pledge 5’s largest fund-
raiser,” Sacco said.
The initial stores were proﬁ  t-
able during Fall and prompted the foundation to open more. The 
Gator Stompin’ concert was a suc-
cess last year, so this year, Bow-man shot higher — Waka Flocka Flame and Grammy-nominated DJ 
Wolfgang Gartner would surely 
increase ticket sales, he thought.
Taking in to account artist 
compensation, venue fees and other concert costs, Pledge 5 paid 
close to $90,000 to bring the duo 
downtown.
“We realized it was gonna be 
a bigger event, so we staffed up,” 
Bowman said, who grew his paid 
Gator Stompin’ team to about 25 
members before the event.
Then spring came, and thrift 
shop sales went down. Average daily revenue dropped to a quar-
ter of what it had been in the fall. Because Pledge 5’s University Av-enue location is so reliant on stu-dents, it took the move-out season much harder than other area thrift 
stores.
“We would have been OK if 
our thrift shop revenue remained 
steady through the spring,” Bow-man said. “To say it plummeted 
would be an understatement.”
The concert was paid for, but 
Pledge 5 had yet to compensate 
its employees and had no funds 
available to reimburse the bars 
and restaurants.
“The attrition was fast and fu-
rious,” Bowman said.
Frustrated and unemployed, 
Sacco spoke to the U.S. Depart-ment of Labor in Jacksonville and ﬁ  led the lawsuit, but she said she doesn’t expect to get back the 
money she’s owed.
“I know I will not get that,” she 
said. “He simply does not have 
it.”
As for Gator Stompin’, Sacco 
said she doesn’t see how it could continue after this year. Pledge 5 lost all its money and “lost the trust of businesses,” she said.But Bowman said he has a vi-
able plan to get it all back.
“In the future, we’re going to 
separate Gator Stompin’ from Pledge 5,” Bowman said. He plans to gain capital for Gator Stompin’ through an equity crowdfunding website called SeedInvest, which 
began after the Jumpstart Our 
Business Startups Act deregulated certain online business ventures in 2012.
Like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, 
SeedInvest crowdfunds to start-up businesses. But rather than taking donations, SeedInvest sells shares.
Gator Stompin’ will have to 
break from Pledge 5 and become its own business in order to take advantage of investors’ money, 
but Bowman said he believes it’s 
the best option he has to get out of debt.
“You can’t call the year’s festi-
val a failure by the event,” Bow-
man said, “It’s a failure because 
we didn’t have enough capital to run it.”
He said he believes the equity 
crowdfunding plan is viable be-cause Gainesville residents love Gator Stompin’ and want to see it continue.
“It’ll put the event in the hands 
of the community,” he said. 
Bowman, who graduated from 
UF with a doctorate in psychol-ogy, said he understands that al-
though this year’s ﬁ  nancial deci-
sions were his, they affected a lot of people.
“They affected my employees. 
They affected the business owners 
that trusted me to be able to make 
their payments,” he said.
Pledge 5 has been trying to 
regain that trust by issuing busi-nesses small checks as thrift store 
proﬁ  ts begin to increase again. He 
has a few employees working in the thrift shops and three on staff at the ofﬁ  ce, and he said he can-
celed all upcoming Pledge 5 char-
ity drives and volunteer service events.
“I won’t feel comfortable until 
everything is right,” he said.
Some of Bowman’s friends and 
colleagues are willing to lend the leeway.
“He’s a good guy,” said pho-
tographer Rodney Rogers, who shot photos for Gator Stompin’ this year but was paid only $10 of the $100 he was promised.
Rogers said this is the ﬁ  rst time 
something like this has ever hap-pened.
“I have full faith that I will be 
repaid,” he said.
Even if the crowdfunding plan 
falls through, Bowman said he’s conﬁ  dent thrift store sales will produce enough to pay everyone back by the end of 2014 and said 
Gainesville shouldn’t have doubts 
about Gator Stompin’ 2015.
“This is obviously a tragedy,” 
Bowman said. “But I really think 
that we’re going to get through 
it.”
Gator Stompin’ has plans to crowdfund itself out of debt

“You can’t call the year’s 
festival a failure by the 
event. It’s a failure because 
we didn’t have enough 
capital to run it.”
Jason Bowman
Pledge 5 directorAccording to the state, the friends 
met at the UF Hub at around 2 p.m. 
on Sept. 20, 2012. They went to Zax-by’s, then Best Buy. They bought the CD and then drove around aimless-
ly, discussing Bravo’s issues.
At around 4 p.m., security foot-
age shows Bravo’s car arriving in 
the parking lot of the old WalMart on Northwest 13th Street. 
At 6:49 p.m., the car left, and 
Aguilar was dead. His cause of death was strangulation, and it took him 13 minutes to die. The state said 
Bravo probably used a woven belt 
found in the car by police.
But according to the defense, 
Aguilar was alive when the car left the parking lot. They said Bravo and Aguilar picked up a hitchhiker, whom they let out later. 
Then the pair got into an argu-
ment. Aguilar wanted to leave the 
car. Bravo then got him out of the car 
and “beat him for 10 to 15 minutes,” leaving him bloody, on the ground and barely breathing.
When Aguilar’s girlfriend, Fri-
man, called Bravo the next day asking where Aguilar was, he told her about the argument, but not the beating. He went with her to the police station to report Aguilar missing. 
This was not Friman and Bravo’s 
ﬁ  rst time meeting. The two had dated for almost three years in high school. As Friman testiﬁ  ed on Tues-day, the breakup was messy and emotional on Bravo’s end. 
He was set to attend Florida In-
ternational University on scholar-
ship, and Friman had her sights set 
on Santa Fe.Over the last few days, the state 
has called Aguilar’s family and friends to the stand, as well as police 
ofﬁ  cers and forensic experts.
Brian Kramer, who leads the 
prosecution, paints a picture of Bra-
vo as a disturbed, suicidal individ-ual who will do anything to get his former love back, including move to Gainesville and attend Santa Fe. 
Upon his arrival in Gainesville, 
Bravo sought advice for reunit-
ing with Friman with their mutual 
friends. One of them, Rosa Felibert, arranged the meeting between Agu-ilar and Bravo on the day of Agui-lar’s disappearance, she testiﬁ  ed on Tuesday.On the stand, Friman read ex-
cerpts from Bravo’s sketchbook, which he uses as a journal. 
“I want her back, please. I’ll give 
anything. Please, please, please…” 
“No one will stop me I will get 
out of Miami and into Gainesville by January 2013 and I will get her back”
She also read from his suicide 
note, which he wrote during his ﬁ  rst week in jail.
“Every day in here is a day spent 
waiting to die. I am a monster for hurting Chris the way I did and monsters shouldn’t exist in this world.”
“I have spent everyday wishing to go back in time, to have taken my life before any of this happened.”
Suicidal tendencies plagued Bra-
vo, both sides agree. He wrote about it often, and one of his friends, Javi-era Ramirez, testiﬁ  ed Tuesday that he “played the suicide card often.”
On Sept. 16 and 17, 2012,  Bravo 
made a series of troubling Internet searches, which were shown to the jury during the testimony of Michael Antal, a digital forensics expert who 
searched Bravo’s computer.
He found searches like “what 
is chloroform,” “good anesthetic 
chemicals,” “how to slice your wrist the right way” and “why not to com-mit suicide.”Antal also found searches like 
“can rubbing alcohol knock some-one out,” “stats on unsolved mur-
ders” and “how do sleeping pills kill 
you.”
In the opening statement, the 
state showed security footage stills where Bravo was buying a shovel, knife, duct tape and sleeping pills with cash on Sept. 16.
Gainesville Police Ofﬁ  cer Ken 
Beerbower, who searched Bravo’s 
car the day Aguilar was reported 
missing, testiﬁ  ed Wednesday that he found a Gatorade bottle with no label in Bravo’s trunk. It was ﬁ  lled with a powdery white substance.
Denise Holmquist, senior crime 
lab analyst for the Florida Depart-ment of Law Enforcement, testiﬁ  ed Wednesday that she tested the sub-
stance using a mass spectrometer 
and gas chromatograph. 
She found that the powdery sub-
stance contained diphenhydramine and Acetaminophen, ingredients commonly found in ZZZQuil and Equate acetaminophen PM, the sleeping pill brands Bravo bought.
Gainesville Police Ofﬁ  cer Ahipo 
Doualehi testiﬁ  ed Wednesday that when he searched Bravo’s complex, he found Aguilar’s backpack balled up inside Bravo’s backpack.
It still contained Aguilar’s wallet, 
books with his name on them and a receipt for Aguilar’s free UF ﬂ  u shot, dated Sept. 20, 2012.
Claudia Aguilar, Christian’s 
mother, testiﬁ  ed Tuesday that she texted and called her son often, al-most daily. 
Aguilar sent his mom a picture 
of him smiling, showing off his free ﬂ  u shot. It was the last text she ever 
received from her son.

Stegath said one of his biggest concerns with Gov. Rick Scott 
and other professional politicians is that they support the mon-ey that got them elected.
“Scott is shortsighted and doesn’t really have any technical 
knowledge.” Stegath said. ”(Politicians) have their supporters who say ‘This is a good idea,’ and they don’t have the knowl-
edge to say ‘Hey, that’s not a good idea.’”
Stegath also seeks to address power plant inefﬁ  ciency, make

Darts & Laurels
When he’s not too busy being a generally unexciting 
gubernatorial candidate, Charlie Crist is using a grim statistic to liven up what the Miami Herald 
called a “buzzless” campaign. Crist pointed to a 2013 study that found Florida women make just 83 cents on the dollar that Florida men make. PolitiFact Florida debunked his claim, citing a more recent study that found women actually make 
a whopping 84 cents on the dollar, as per a study from April. 
Furthermore, PolitiFact found, the wage gap in Florida has only decreased 1.8 percent since 1990. 
A number of often cited factors inﬂ  uence this gap: Discrim-
ination, certainly, but also the discouraging fact that women 
and men enter different occupations at different rates. This is 
known as “occupational segregation,” i.e. why so many men are software engineers and why so many women are nurses. Both of these ﬁ  elds are changing, of course, as well as oth-
ers, but — seriously, only 2 percent in a quarter of a century? 
That’s a nightmare. This week, we’re tossing a get-your-s**t-
together-and-pay-ladies-more DART at the dismal Florida 
pay gap. 
The Tampa Bay Times reported this week that early vot-
ing in Florida for the primaries is undergoing a serious make-over, with more days and locations and counties. Polls open statewide on Monday, and they’ll remain open until Aug. 24 — and we better see you there! To close out the summer, 
we’re awarding a pre-emptive LAUREL to everyone taking 
advantage of the early vote.
More dismal numbers for this week’s darts: Al Jazeera 
America reports that 10 percent of cancer survivors “gam-
ble with their health” by continuing to smoke tobacco after 
they’ve been cured. Survivors of bladder cancer smoke the 
most tobacco, the study found, followed by lung cancer sur-vivors. Bleak, considering the sheer amount of resources available for individuals to quit smoking these days. We have 
mixed feelings about this one — on one hand, smoking is one 
of the hardest addictions to overcome, and many survivors do want to quit. But on the other hand, we feel obligated to toss a tough-love DART at the health gamblers who con-
tinue to smoke after beating cancer. 
And last, but certainly not least, our departing three-
semester-veteran opinions editor is handing off a special-edition freedom-of-speech LAUREL to the dedicated com-
munity of Alligator online commenters. We won’t drop 
usernames, but it’d be unfair not to acknowledge the count-
less minutes you spend telling us what, exactly, is wrong with the Alligator and its writers. A cursory survey of other college newspapers has revealed that the Alligator stands alone in its ability to inspire vitriol in the same handful of 
anonymous commenters, so we thank ours for standing by 
us. At the end of the day, it’s not the photographers, writers and editors who are the heroes: It’s the ones who wake up every day, log into a ghost account and call us morons who are the real heroes. Blessings. 
Have a great break!

If you’ve seen the eastern half of Gainesville, there’s no 
question that we are home to seriously impoverished areas. A lack of quality jobs and economic development 
keeps the area depressed and few — if any — local lead-ers currently hold the key to solving the never-ending cri-
sis. Some Gainesville residents are pinning their hopes to a 
company who owns more land than anyone else in Alachua County. 
Sadly, this out-of-state company’s promises appear emp-
ty.
Plum Creek is a large, national company based in Seattle 
that also happens to own tens of thousands of acres in the eastern portions of Alachua County. After using much of the land for timber farming, Plum Creek wants to sell nearly 
20,000 acres of their land to a developer who will subse-
quently build homes, shopping centers and industrial and commercial developments. 
Essentially, Plum Creek wants to get thousands of acres 
that sit on swampland to be rezoned so a developer will buy the land from Plum Creek and put homes and businesses on top of the swamps. 
This is not a small development. It’s a small city in a 
swamp. If this sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because devel-
opers have done this in south Florida for more than a cen-
tury, destroying signiﬁ  cant portions of the environment in the process. 
To bolster its case, Plum Creek launched a public rela-
tions machine, promising thousands of jobs to those living in east Gainesville — never mind how they will get from east Gainesville to the Plum Creek development — and new op-portunities for the eastern part of the county. 
Downtown Gainesville has drastically changed for the 
better in recent years, but there are still many empty store-fronts littering the area. 
The city of Gainesville is in a much better location to serve 
as an economic center for those looking for work in east Gainesville. Instead of promising citizens a pie-in-the-sky de-velopment that may only beneﬁ  t the corporate landowners, we need to do a better job providing economic opportunities right here in Gainesville.  If we have citizens who can’t 
get to jobs and services in the Gainesville city limits, how are we going to get them to eastern Alachua County? Regional Tran-
sit System has few routes in east 
Gainesville, and when was the last time you saw public transporta-tion on the roads of Hawthorne or Windsor? 
We need a plan for all of Alachua County that makes 
sense, not one that beneﬁ  ts a company based on the other side of the country. Smart developments that help lift strug-gling areas out of poverty and ensure our environment is 
protected are in the best interest of all those living in Alachua 
County. 
Citizens in towns across the county have banded togeth-
er to create a community group called Stand By Our Plan. The group spent the last several months educating Alachua County residents about Plum Creek’s plans as well as the county’s comprehensive plan. 
Alachua County’s comprehensive plan was developed 
with input from individuals and groups throughout the 
county and helps lay the foundation for positive growth that 
beneﬁ  ts citizens and the environment around us. 
Plum Creek, on the other hand, wants the county to 
change the rules, beneﬁ  tting only Plum Creek, while they tell our friends and neighbors about their proposed city in the swamp and the supposed beneﬁ  ts of such a development. 
We tend to ignore local issues, but Plum Creek’s pro-
posed development has enormous implications on the future of Alachua County. The primary election is on Aug. 26, and 
the Plum Creek issue is one of the hottest issues driving the 
campaign conversation. It’s very likely that the outcome of the primary will determine whether Plum Creek gets its way or whether we, the local residents, win.
Educate yourself on the issues, and don’t forget to vote.  
The future of Alachua County depends on it.

Audience members at EarFilms’ presentations put on blindfolds and step 
into a 90-minute experience for their imaginations. The company will bring the presentations to the Phillips Center Aug. 25 through Aug. 29.  
JOEY MARTINEZ
Avenue Writer
EarFilms is coming to UF – to give your 
sense of vision a break.
The EarFilms presentation will be held 
Aug. 25 through Aug. 29 at 7:30 p.m. each 
night in the Squitieri Studio Theatre in the 
West Wing of the Phillips Center for the Per-
forming Arts.
Amy Douglas, the director of Marketing 
and Communications for UF Performing Arts, said it is a unique performance in that audience members will not be able to see anything.
“EarFilms has been described as ‘a sonic 
storytelling experience for the ears and the 
imagination,’” Douglas said.
The story that will be narrated, “To Sleep 
To Dream,” is about a society where dream-
ing has been outlawed.
“An EarFilms is an immersive 3-D film that uses no visuals, instead 3-D sound sur-rounds the listener and places them, and their imaginations, right into the heart of the story,” said Daniel Marcus Clark, founding 
artist of the UK-based EarFilms company and 
writer, director and narrator of “To Sleep To Dream.”
Clark said he will be narrating the piece 
live as audience members sit inside with more than 20 loudspeakers surrounding them. They will put on blindfolds and step into a 90-minute experience for their imagi-nations.
The idea grew out of the desire to create a 
format that had the immediacy of film with the imaginative potential of literature. Clark said it is also exciting to begin to give sound a storytelling voice it had previously struggled to have in other audio and visual formats that are led either by voice or image.
He said he has been exploring this work 
for about 12 years and that it is inspired by the idea of finding the most powerful ways that music and spoken stories could sit to-gether. EarFilms grew out of that work as sound design started to come into the mix.
“As a company we’ve now been working 
together for the last five years, and prototypes have been created, but this is our debut fea-ture piece,” Clark said. “To get this one right we ended up remaking the piece around four times.”
This will be the first tour in the U.S., 
though an extract of the show was presented at an art and technology center in New York 
City a couple of years ago.
“We’re really excited to be coming to the 
University of Florida,” Clark said. “We’ve 
heard audiences are great there and always up for exciting new experiences.”
Douglas said it is a different kind of pre-
sentation in that it asks the audience to be-come a part of the storytelling process. She said she thinks audience members will find it not only innovative but hopefully also re-freshing and, perhaps, inspiring.
It is not like a traditional film, where the 
filmmaker creates the images of the story; it 
allows the audience to create their own, she 
said. Audience members experiences will be based on what they have created in their imaginations. Total capacity for each perfor-mance is small and the intimacy of the house will make the experience seem that much more personal. About 400 people are expect-ed during the five-performance run.
“In a world filled with screens, both big 
and small, as well as a constant influx of news, information and entertainment from a variety of sources,” Douglas said, “EarFilms strips all of that away, asking the audience to rely solely on two elements: sound and their imagination.”

$10 for UF students. Purchase tickets at bit.ly/1v7LW9Q.

Gluten-free eating has become synony-
mous with guilt-free eating, though that may 
not actually be the case.
A recent UF study, published in the Journal 
of Nutrition Education and Behavior, looked 
to see if labeling an item gluten-free altered 
consumer perception of the food’s taste and nutrition.
In a one-day experiment at UF in 
February, 97 people ate cookies and chips, all gluten-free. Half were la-beled “gluten-free”; the other half la-beled “conventional.”
Participants then rated each food 
on a nine-point scale for how much they liked the flavor and texture, ac-cording to Caroline Glagola Dunn, a 28-year-old UF food science and human nutrition Ph.D candidate and principal researcher.
“Consumers didn’t perceive nutrition dif-
ferences between conventional and gluten-free products, which was interesting because when we did a survey at the end of the taste panel 
we found that 37 percent of our respondents 
said gluten-free products were healthier than their counterparts,” Glagola Dunn said.
“So although they don’t think the products 
were individually nutritionally different than each other, they thought that gluten-free prod-ucts were healthier.”
Thirty-one percent believed gluten-free di-
ets improve overall health, 35 percent believed 
they improve digestive health and 32 percent 
felt it would improve their diet.
A gluten-free diet is prescribed to those 
with celiac disease, a digestive and autoim-mune disorder that affects about 1 percent of the U.S. population, damaging the lining of the small intestine when foods with gluten are eaten.
However, refined gluten-free foods, for the 
most part, are not enriched or fortified with essential vitamins and minerals, according to Janis Mena, a registered dietitian and nutri-
tionist for UF’s Student Health Care Center.
Mena said she does not recommend pur-
suing a gluten-free diet unless it is medically 
necessary.
“People with celiac are valid, they 
really need to be gluten-free. I don’t know why anyone else would become gluten-free because people can and should enjoy bread in moderation,” 
Mena said.
Meredith Krzys, a 21-year-old UF 
event management senior, said she 
gave up gluten for Lent a year and a half ago 
and hasn’t looked back since.
“I stuck with it because I felt good and I 
realized I didn’t need to eat the things I ate before. It promoted me to essentially a whole-foods plant-based diet, I wasn’t eating any-
thing processed,” Krzys said.
Katelyn Adamson, a 21-year-old UF math-
ematics senior who was diagnosed with celiac 
disease in February of 2013, said she doesn’t believe people need to become gluten-free to eat healthier.
“They have to put more in the processed 
foods to make them consistency wise the same, so most gluten-free foods have more 
fat or more calories,” Adamson said. “In fact, 
you’re probably consuming more calories than you were before.”
Adamson said she is worried that people 
aren’t educating themselves properly before undertaking this lifestyle change.Don’t be gullible for gluten-freeRIANA MELENDEZ

Gainesville has more to offer 
thrift shoppers than some might 
think.
While most know about Salva-
tion Army, Plato’s Closet and Good-
will when shopping for affordable 
second-hand clothing, here are a few hidden-gems Gainesville has to offer.
1) Flashbacks Recycled FashionThis store at 509 NW 10th Ave. 
may look rugged on the outside, but it is packed with fashionable second-hand clothes within.
“This is such a hole-in-the-wall 
kind of place, I guess you would have to know Gainesville pretty 
well to just come shop over here,” 
said 22-year-old UF sustainability studies senior Christy Reed, an em-ployee at Flashbacks.
Clothes aren’t always brand 
name, but there’s a lot of Forever 21 and a few other recognizable brands.
The store features up-to-date 
style, usually determined by fash-ion blogs and Internet trends, Reed said.
“Here you can ﬁ  nd something 
that you can actually wear,” said 22-year-old anthropology and linguis-tics sophomore  Rasha Chouder.
It’s open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Mon-
day through Saturday and 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. 
There will also be a Flashbacks 
opening on University Avenue by the end of the summer.
2) Family Treasures Thrift 
Shop
With “Thrift Store” painted in 
bold letters on the side of the build-ing at 710 N. Main St., it’s hard to miss this store when you’re passing through Main Street.
The store holds a great variety of 
items, never turning down a dona-
tion.
“We try our best with every-
thing, we even give the clothes we 
don’t use to guys who recycle the ﬁ  bers for other things,” said the 25-year-old manager, Heather Uuk.
The store is spacious and well or-
ganized, and makes it easy for you to ﬁ  nd exactly what you’re looking 
for.
All clothes have ﬁ  xed prices, 
nothing more than $10.
Specials are posted daily, and on Fridays students get 15 percent off 
of purchases.
It’s open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
on Monday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday.
3) Outreach Thrift StoreThis 26-year-old, family-owned 
store at 125 NW 23rd Ave. is your typical thrift shop, with crowded racks and baskets full of random goodies waiting to be picked up for 50 cents.
“We only take things in better to best condition,” said Glenn Velleka-mp, the owner.
While most stores have a limited 
amount of clothes in the men’s sec-tion, here it’s packed with a diverse selection. 
The store’s best bargains include 
the 25-cent and clearance racks in the back, which are updated daily.
It’s open from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Monday through Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.

“The Greenes always re-
quest for small slices. You 
can ask them if they would like just a little more, or if 
they are sure they are full, 
and they always express with 
certainty, ‘I really only want 
a tiny slice.’ 
But a few minutes later, 
one of them is bound to ask 
for another slice. Then the 
round of tiny slices proceeds. This is what we call the ‘Greenes portion.’”
This folktale indicates 
how serving food appor-tionment constitutes a kind of communication. Whether serving food in a family set-
ting or at a dinner party, the 
expectations and behaviors 
that accompany the service carry deeper social meaning. 
Indeed, food serving may 
be interpreted as an expres-
sion of the feelings, attitudes 
and sensitivities of the par-ticipants. 
Offering to share food 
or the delegation of the last piece on the serving dish are 
acts of communication, hence 
“The Rhetoric of Portions,” as deﬁ  ned by linguist Amy 
Shuman. 
The sharing of food re-
quires tact and skill in com-
municating. The rules of conduct accompanying food 
apportionment carry social 
meaning, and they may not 
always be in agreement.
Food apportionment in 
Western civilization was 
mainly self-service until the 
end of the 19th century when 
the host began to serve food 
and apportion it to guests with careful attention to sta-
tus.
 If given inappropriate 
portions, the guest might be 
insulted, at times intention-ally: In-laws may be given 
less food than the children 
or small portions may indi-
cate a critique of the diner’s 
waistline. 
Likewise, the guest has 
protocol in how to act (be in-terested in the host, not just 
the food) and how much to 
eat. Food left on the dish may 
be a compliment or may signal wanting more food. Family members also follow 
dining etiquette with some 
families developing secret 
codes in how to act when 
guests arrived: “F.H.B.” for “Family Hold Back” when 
the guests need more food, 
“L.K.F.” for “Lick and Keep 
Forks” to ensure there will be 
enough ﬂ  atware for every-one, or “M.I.K” which desig-
nates “More in Kitchen.”
A lone piece of chocolate 
cake remains. Who gets it? 
The last piece or the “old maid” becomes a subject of 
elaborate negotiations in who 
should offer and who should 
accept it. 
How much food is avail-
able, the modesty of fellow 
table mates, and equality 
come into the elaborate and 
subtle politics of dining eti-
quette. Serving food, receiv-ing food and eating together 
is no simple matter.

Magic Man has grown a bit since its 
inception in 2010. Originally consisting 
only of vocalist Alex Caplow and gui-tarist/keyboardist Sam Vanderhoop Lee, Magic Man expanded to a quintet 
for the 2013 EP, “You Are Here.” Their 
new studio album “Before The Waves” caters to the indie pop and synth pop crowd but fails to stand out among their contemporaries.
“Before The Waves” contains the 
sugary, sweet lyrics and bouncy pro-duction heard in almost every synth pop band these days. The group’s lap-
top-focused beginnings makes itself ap-
parent through the use of catchy synths and cheery effects. 
The inclusion of live drums and gui-
tar elevate the album’s tracks and give it much needed weight. “Out of Mind” layers an adept guitar solo over the saccharine beats dominating the song. While some of the electronic production 
grows stale rather quickly, the upbeat 
grooves of songs like “Waves” will stay in your head for days.
Magic Man’s strongest trait comes 
from frontman Caplow’s nostalgic singing. His voice, a calming baritone, evokes the exuberant stylings of classic 80’s 
pop songs. Caplow’s 
ﬂ  exibility gives Magic Man some diversity as well. 
Caplow goes from from singing 
downbeat lyrics like “But every single day that passes by is making me more dishonest” on “Too Much” to chanting uplifting sing alongs like “So cover my skin with your sun-kissed light/There’s a bonﬁ  re burning tonight” on “Texas”; the tonal shifts to avoid being inconsis-
tent or hackneyed.
While Magic Man’s lyricism never 
falters, the group’s overall sound offers 
only temporary enjoyment. The sum-mery production and Caplow’s croon-
ing owes largely to many bands and 
genres that either came before them or 
continue to work today. 
“Before The Waves” represents a 
ephemeral amalgamation of its many inﬂ  uences that falls short of creating a permanent style. The potential deﬁ  nite-ly exists for Magic Man, so hopefully, the group will pursue charting more distinct territory for its next effort.Magic Man’s ‘Before The 
Waves’ derivative, but funTANIMA MEHROTRA

Heston Dunnam is obsessed with 
trains. 
Standing exactly 3 feet tall, wearing 
a red-and-white-striped outﬁ  t complete 
with circular glasses with shaded lenses, 
the 4-year-old looks like a mini “Where’s 
Waldo.” His left eye is concealed by a bright yellow bandage covered in red and blue train carts. 
“Our house is covered in train tracks,” 
his mother, Stephanie Dunnam, said. “Some parents have to worry about step-ping on Legos. We have to worry about stepping on trains and tracks.”
Dunnam and her family live in Haw-
thorne, near Highway 301. Trains pass by their house daily, one in front of the house, the other beside it. 
“He just sits by the window and watch-
es them,” she said. 
At 2, Heston was diagnosed with what 
is now referred to as broad spectrum au-tism, or Asperger’s Syndrome. Equally 
as deep as his love for trains is his fear of 
sound and loud noises.    
Heston is so afraid of loud noises that 
he often puts on a pair of bright red, sound-proof headphones in the evening, to soften the noise of his father’s voice when he comes home from work.
“Sound is his true enemy,” his mother, 
42, said. 
To help her son conquer his fear of 
sound, Dunnam devised a 30-day, 4,361-mile long family excursion spanning ﬁ  ve states and six major railways starting Sept. 15. She advertised her plans for the project, a combination of a self-published book and a calendar of photographs, by creating a page on Kickstarter, an online funding platform that aims to “bring cre-
ative projects to life” through crowdfund-
ing. The page is titled “The ‘Lil’ Engineer That Could,” a homage to one of Heston’s favorite stories. 
The project will only be funded if at 
least $15,000 is pledged by Aug. 19. It is an all-or-nothing deal. As of press time, the project has raised $453, with 12 days left to raise the rest. 
If the full amount is not raised in time, 
then the family will have to go back to the drawing board.
Dunnam said she hopes to simultane-
ously capture her son’s love for trains and help him conquer his fear of loud noises with the trip but is afraid she won’t be around long enough to get it done.
She said she has terminal cancer.“In 18 months, I probably won’t even 
be able to hold a camera,” Dunnam said. 
She said her ultimate goal is to convince 
her son to step foot on a train.

The UF Alumni Association and Univer-
sity Athletic Association have teamed up to 
host Rally in The Swamp on Aug. 24. Doors open at 7 p.m., and the event starts at 8 p.m.
Alicia Longworth, assistant athletics direc-
tor for the marketing and promotions depart-ment at UAA, said a big portion of the event will consist of the UF Marching Band, UF cheerleaders and UF Dazzlers. The football team, some student athletes and coach Will Muschamp will help get students pumped up for the season opener against Idaho.
In the concourse on the east side of the 
stadium, students will be able to play games, 
win prizes and have their picture taken with 
Albert and Alberta.
The ﬁ  rst 3,000 students to get a card 
punched at three booths will be able to pick up free Domino’s Pizza at the concession stands.
“We’re just kind of hoping that the stu-
dents are excited for Gator football, they’re excited for the opportunity to get into the 
football stadium — just themselves — and 
not have any general fans,” Longworth said.
Anthony Campanella, a 20-year-old UF 
nutritional sciences junior, said he is transfer-ring to UF in the Fall and is looking forward to game days.
“It’s hard to come in as a junior and not 
be able to know the traditions that take place during game day,” he said. “I’m looking 
forward to this pep rally so that I am able to 
cheer on the Gators and know the traditions beforehand.”Watch the

There are nine basic forms of 
energy — from kinetic to sound, 
nuclear to light — but running 
back Kelvin Taylor would like to 
submit a tenth for your approval.
This type of energy is more sim-
plistic and impactful. 
Just one month ago, the sopho-
more had the symbol (+) and the 
word “Energy” tattooed on his 
right wrist to symbolize positive energy: the fuel that keeps him going when challenges come his 
way.
For football players, as with all 
human beings, it can be difficult 
to stay positive in the face of ad-versity. There are injuries to fight 
through, expectations to meet and 
— of course — losing. 
Florida had a bit of all three on 
its way to a disastrous 4-8 season 
in 2013, but Taylor has found his 
own way to stay in good spirits even when the game he loves deals 
him a poor hand.
“I’m always a positive guy 
and no matter what you’ve got to 
be a positive guy so that’s why I got positive energy,” he said. “So 
that’s just one thing I love, positive 
energy and everybody that I like to hang out with are positive people so that’s why I got it.”Last year, Taylor was able to 
stay positive by leaning on his family, his faith in God and good old fashioned hard work combined with a bit of patience that his time would come as the feature back in 
the UF backfield. 
After teammate Matt Jones went 
down with a torn meniscus against 
LSU on Oct. 12, Taylor ran 10 times 
for 52 yards in Jones’ absence.
He got better as the season pro-
gressed and was at his best in Flori-
da’s loss at South Carolina on Nov. 16 when he recorded 21 carries 
for 96 yards and two touchdowns 
including the second-longest run of his career (29). But it wasn’t all success for him. Taylor struggled 
in pass-blocking situations as well 
as catching the ball out of the back-field.
“I could say last year just com-
ing out of high school they really 
didn’t ask you to pass block that 
much,” he said. “But in college you’ve got to be a complete back and you’ve got to know how to 
pass block and you’ve got to know 
how to catch the ball out of the backfield, you’ve got to be a com-plete back.”
To round out his skill set, Taylor 
has taken extra reps with the JUGS machine after practice and worked on pass blocking drills with of-fensive tackle D.J. Humphries. He 
said he has forced those things into 
his workout plan and because of it

Ryan Lochte has faced scrutiny dur-
ing the past year.
Between his reality TV show “What 
Would Ryan Lochte Do?” being can-
celled in September, a torn MCL and sprained ACL in his left knee and a re-aggrevation of his knee at the Mesa Grand Prix in April, Lochte knows what it’s like for others to doubt him.
But he doesn’t care.“To me it goes through one ear, out 
the other. I don’t pay attention to it, and I can’t, or else I’d probably quit swimming a long time ago,” the five-time Olympic gold medalist said on Tuesday, the day before the USA National Champion-ships, in Irvine, Calif.
“But I mean, I feel like there’s always a bump in the road for me. It’s never a 
smooth path. I always 
prepared myself for 
the worst, and you 
know, I think this year 
has been the hard-est year I’ve ever had 
in my entire life, just knee surgery, just 
tearing my knee like left and right, being out of the water for so long.”
Lochte said his knee is back to 100 
percent, and it looked so after competi-
tion on Wednesday.
“(The doctors) said I should be in like 
a science book because of the way I re-
covered so quickly. They’re in shock,” Lochte said. “I’m supposed to be just get-Lochte says he should “be

The injury that sidelined Dominique Ea-
sley for the final year of his college football 
career is currently costing him in the NFL.
Easley, who was selected by the New Eng-
land Patriots in the first round of the NFL 
Draft in May, is still rehabbing the surgically 
repaired ACL in his right knee.
The former Gators defensive end was ex-
pected to miss much of the Patriots’ camp due to his injury, but the lack of practice forced the team to leave him in Foxboro, Mass., while it travels for joint practices and preseason games.
According to the Boston Herald, Easley 
has not been cleared to play and will stay home while the Patriots and the Washington Redskins hold a joint practice in Virginia.  
The 6-foot-2, 290-pound defensive end is 
cleared to participate in New England’s prac-tice on Saturday.
Easley partook in the team’s minicamp 
in June and has been restricted to condition-ing work during training camp. He is now 
expected to miss games during the regular 
season.
If he remains on the non-football injury list through the final round of roster cuts, he’ll likely miss at least the first six games of the year.
The Patriots are commit-
ted to having Easley at 100 percent health and therefore will not rush his recovery. 
Joe Haden believes 
Browns’ defense becoming above average: The Cleve-
land Browns believe their defense can be very special this season.
A leader of that defense is Pro-Bowl cor-
nerback Joe Haden who has led the Browns defensive unit since he was drafted out of Florida in 2010.
Haden, who starred on Urban Meyer’s 
2008 national championship squad, has fully bought into Browns’ head coach Mike Pettine and his defensive focus.
“I’ve never really had a defensive-minded 
coach before,” Haden said. “He’s in there for the defensive installs, he’s installing our de-
fense for us as the head coach and I’ve never 
had that before. I really like that.”
Pettine, who was previously the Buffalo 
Bills defensive coordinator in 2013, accepted Easley not cleared to practice See footbAll, PA ge  16

Leagueting back in the water a couple 
weeks ago, but I’ve been in the 
water for almost two months now. I healed up really quick.”
In the 100-meter freestyle 
preliminary heats, Lochte clocked in with a 49.21-second outing, good for eighth overall in the 78-swimmer ﬁ  eld.
He placed second in the ﬁ  -
nals later that day, ﬁ  nishing in 48.96 seconds to claim a spot on the national team in the event.
His knee held up, but he 
expects more of himself as the week progresses
“I can’t expect best times,” 
Lochte said. 
“It’s going to take time, and I 
know in the big picture, when it happens, it’s going to happen.” 
Current Gators competing 
at National Championships: A total of 25 athletes on Florida’s 2014-15 roster and three who graduated in the spring are also competing at nationals, with 20 making their debut in the com-petition on Wednesday.
Elizabeth Beisel and Caeleb Dressel were the highlight of the bunch.
Beisel touched the wall in 
the 200-meter butterﬂ  y prelims with a time of 2:10.72 to ﬁ  nish sixth in the ﬁ  eld and qualify for the ‘A’ cut ﬁ  nals. But she did not participate in the ﬁ  nals.
Dressel, the No. 1 recruit 
in the 2014 class according to swimswam.com, was the fast-est current UF athlete in the 100m free, ﬁ  nishing 31st with a 49.93-second performance to earn a spot in the ‘C’ cut ﬁ  nals.
He ﬁ  nished eighth in the 
heat with a time of 51.30 sec-onds.
Day 2 will consist of ﬁ  ve 
events — the 200-meter free-style, breaststroke and back-stroke, the 50-meter butterﬂ  y and the men’s 4x200-meter freestyle — and will see 14 UF athletes in the pool.
“This is a great opportunity 
for each individual to get some exposure and compete at a high level,” UF coach Gregg Troy said in a release. “This week will also be a good measure of how everyone’s training has been going this summer.”the Cleveland head coaching posi-
tion on January 23.
Having a head coach that thinks 
defense ﬁ  rst is a new concept for the Browns organization. The new direction has Haden ready to step up his game to an elite level.
Haden, who is arguably one of 
the best cornerbacks in the NFL 
next to Richard Sherman and Pat-
rick Peterson, has ambitions to lead the Browns over the hump of a long-standing losing tradition. 
Riley Cooper to miss ﬁ  rst pre-
season game: Catching footballs 
from the JUGS pitching machine in practice is normal, but doing it while wearing a walking boot is 
unusual.
Former Gator and current 
Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver 
Riley Cooper was wearing a pres-sure boot to protect his right ankle and has been ruled out to play the team’s preseason opener against the Chicago Bears on Friday.   
According to Cooper, his ankle 
is nothing more than a tweak, but the Eagles are treating it carefully since the team’s other top receiver, Jeremy Maclin, has been wearing a boot as well.
Cooper has had the nagging 
ankle injury for about a week, and the Eagles will keep him out for an-other week or two until he reaches 
a full recovery.
Eagles head coach Chip Kelly 
doesn’t believe Cooper’s ankle 
injury is nothing serious and the boot is there as “just a preventable thing.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 7, 2014

NFL , from page 15Muschamp: Runs and blocking schemes same as previous system
he is “ready to go.”
In year No. 2, there’s no more thinking 
for Taylor but merely reading and reacting 
to situations. New offensive coordinator 
Kurt Roper has emphasized eye discipline and playing fast during practice.Taylor said the transition from pro-style 
to up-tempo has been seamless.
“I feel like we ﬁ  t into his offense great 
man,” he said. “We can play into space, it’s 
a downhill offense, it’s a very explosive of-
fense, you can get a lot of different matchups in that offense so I feel like it’s going to be a lot of explosive plays and our offense is go-ing to be just explosive this year, we’re very excited to get things rolling.” 
Taylor’s head coach agrees.“From a standpoint of the run game, the 
runs are the same and block the same,” Will 
Muschamp said at Florida media day. 
“Their entry angle is a little different and 
those guys seem to really like what we did 
in the spring as far as those things are con-cerned from the (shot)gun. That was a con-cern going in, but I thought Kelvin had a re-
ally good spring.”
For Taylor and his teammates to reverse 
the polarity of their disappointing 2013, 
they’ll need an acute understanding of Rop-
er’s offense. 
That, and maybe just a little bit of posi-
tive energy. FOOTBALL , from page 15
