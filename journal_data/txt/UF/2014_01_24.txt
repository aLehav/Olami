President Barack Obama announced plans on Wednesday 
for a task force to protect college students from sexual assault.
The White House task force is designed to raise awareness 
of sexual assaults on college campuses. A White House mem-
orandum stated that the program will provide instruction to 
universities on prevention and response techniques.  Within 
90 days, the task force is expected to evaluate the efforts by college campuses to prevent sexual assault.
According to the memorandum, “studies show that about 
one in ﬁ  ve women is a survivor of attempted or completed sexual violence while in college.” 
Chris Loschiavo, UF associate dean of students and Stu-
dent Conduct and Conﬂ  ict Resolution director, said from 2012 to 2013 UF had eight reported sexual assault cases.
“Most years we only had one or two reported to us,” he 
said. “More awareness is what is going to increase reporting.” 
UF has several programs to educate students about sexual 
assault, help sexual assault victims and promote bystander in-tervention.  
STRIVE at GatorWell is a group of peer educators that 
reaches out to students about sexual assault prevention, in-cluding a collaboration with University Police to promote the importance of consent.
Debra Weiss, a UPD victim advocate, said that sexual as-
sault is a “silent crime” that often goes unreported. 
“We want to help people get access to resources,” she said. 
“We will continue to do everything we can to let people know we are here and that they’re not alone.”
Last Fall, UF created an interpersonal violence prevention 
committee to address issues ranging from sexual assault to bullying and stalking.   
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, UF assistant vice president for Stu-
dent Affairs, said the university has many initiatives related to preventing sexual assault because it is a multifaceted issue, Obama forms

About two weeks after gun advo-
cacy group Florida Carry ﬁ  led a law-
suit against the university to remove its ban on ﬁ  rearms in residence halls, UF has not been served court papers.
Sean Caranna, founder of Florida 
Carry, said the delay was caused by some typos in the lawsuit. A wrong ZIP code was one of the issues Car-anna mentioned. The lawsuit was revised and has been set back in mo-tion.“I don’t see this getting settled be-
fore appearing before a judge,” Car-anna said.
He said Florida Carry petitioned 
to waive the serve of process, mean-ing the court papers are being mailed to UF instead of delivered by the 
county sheriff.UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
wrote in an email that the university 
is still complying with the December appellate court decision that allows ﬁ  rearms to be stored in vehicles on state campuses.
Sikes also said UF is complying 
with Florida law that bans guns on state campuses and in dorm rooms.
The University of North Florida 
and the University of South Florida have amended policies to comply with the court decision, and the Uni-versity of Central Florida is in the process. Typos delay gun-rights lawsuit papers

Had Scott Patrick Harmon been wearing 
a seatbelt as he drove down Interstate 75, he 
might have gotten away with carrying the 37 pounds of marijuana police said he had in his car. However, Gainesville Police arrested the 
35-year-old of Peyton, Colo., Wednesday af-ternoon on charges of marijuana trafﬁ  cking and giving a false ID to law enforcement af-ter ofﬁ  cers pulled him over on a trafﬁ  c stop, according to an arrest report. 
At about 2 p.m., an ofﬁ  cer pulled Harmon 
over near Micanopy and noticed something hanging from the bot-tom of his car. The ofﬁ  cer smelled marijuana coming from his car, according to the report.
The ofﬁ  cer wrote Har-
mon a citation on the seat-belt violation, according to the report.
After writing the warning, the ofﬁ  cer 
searched Harmon’s car and found three suit-cases ﬁ  lled with about 37 pounds of mari-juana wrapped in clear plastic bags — worth roughly $175,000 — according to the report. 
During questioning, Harmon told the of-
ﬁ  cer the driver’s license he provided was his brother’s and that his license was hidden in a pocket in his backpack, according to the re-port. He didn’t comment about the weed.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Harmon into the Alachua 
County Jail at 7:20 p.m., where he remains as of press time in lieu of a $125,000 bond.

The post-recession job market has not been 
kind to recent college graduates. 
According to a report by the Federal Re-
serve Bank of New York published last week, 
44 percent of recent graduates are underem-
ployed, meaning they are working jobs that do 
not require a degree. 
“Kids invest so much into their education,” 
said Patricia Garcia-Linares, a 19-year-old UF 
accounting sophomore. “To think they don’t 
get a return on that investment is scary.”
Underemployment among the nation’s 
younger demographic is nothing new, the study shows. 
The underemployment rate for college grad-
uates has consistently been about 33 percent for the past two decades. But for recent college graduates, the under-
employment rate has hit a new high, rising from 34 percent in 2001 to 44 percent as of 2012. 
Despite these numbers, Heather White, di-
rector of UF’s Career Resource Center, said the futures of UF students look promising.
“What we’ve experienced here at UF is a 
very different story,” she said. “All of our num-bers are showing signiﬁ  cant increases in hir-ing.”
More than 9,000 students interviewed for 
jobs last year through the Career Resource Cen-ter alone, White said. 
She said there was also an increase in em-
ployer attendance at Career Showcase this se-mester. 
“The story and the picture for the Gators is 
positive,” White said. 
Joshua Long, a 22-year-old UF information 
systems junior, said that as a transfer student, he’s in a unique position to compare the career resources UF offers with his previous school’s.
“Most colleges don’t go this far out of their 
way to get kids recruited and get them a job be-fore they’re out of college,” he said.College grads overqualiﬁ  ed for 
available jobs, report says

The Hoggetowne Medieval Faire is 
returning to Gainesville for its annual 
celebration of history and fantasy.
The Faire, which will host eight stag-
es of entertainment and more than 160 
artisans, will run this weekend and next 
at the Alachua County Fairgrounds.
The medieval faire was started by 
the Society for Creative Anachronism 28 years ago, said Linda Piper, Gainesville events coordinator.
“Orlando has Disney, and Gainesville 
has Hoggetowne,” she said.
One of the main attractions will be 
the jousting match put on by the New Riders of the Golden Age. 
“If people appreciate watching hors-
es,” said Kelly Eiley, director of the New Riders, “they will deﬁ  nitely get a kick out of coming out.”
The audience is usually a mixed 
group of all ages. 
Although Charlene Ochogo, a 21-
year-old UF telecommunication senior, said she prefers not to go in costume or adopt an accent, she’s attended the festi-val for four years. She said she enjoys the food and the fantastical atmosphere. 
“I feel like in college, everyone’s tell-
ing you to grow up, and the medieval fair is kind of to rebel against that,” Ochogo said. “Under normal circum-
stances, people would think it was super 
weird — but you can kind of just go and not have to worry what anyone thinks.”
The Faire will be open from 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays and 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Fridays. Admission is $15 for adults, $7 for children and free for kids under 5. Tickets will be half-price Jan. 31.Come all ye olde, come to 
Hoggetowne Medieval fairand that assistance does not 
end with reporting the assault.
“This is a problem we take 
very seriously,” she said. “We want to make sure we are do-
ing what’s best for our students 
at all times.”
For some students, like Han-
nah Bailey, the White House initiative may not be enough to make a difference.“I’m not sure they’re going 
to be able to really do anything other than bring awareness,” said Bailey, an 18-year-old UF exploratory freshman. 
Mastrodicasa said in order 
for the White House task force to be effective, an overall uni-versity representative must be established.
“We want to make sure that 
as national regulations are put in place, university input is be-ing heard as well,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, 2014

The Hippodrome State Theatre will be in-
troducing its new digital projector to the pub-
lic this weekend with a special screening of a classic film.
The event, called Cocktails and Casablan-
ca, will be held at 6:30 p.m. Saturday with an encore showing Sunday at 2 p.m.
Alisha Kinman, cinema director and direc-
tor of development, said the event will kick off the theatre’s new era of digital screening, made possible by the campaign The Hipp Goes Digi-tal, which took place in July and raised money 
to buy a digital projector.
The theatre was given a $25,000 Cultural 
Facilities Grant from the State of Florida Divi-
sion of Cultural Affairs but needed to raise the additional money via the campaign to com-pletely convert to digital equipment, Kinman said. 
More films are being produced only in Dig-
ital Cinema Package, or DCP format, which is phasing out the 35mm format the Hipp used before the upgrade, Kinman said. 
The switch to the digital projector was nec-
essary, she said. 
Although the theater is moving forward 
with technology, the Hippodrome staff de-cided the first film they would show on their new digital projector would be a classic: “Cas-ablanca.”
“Even though we are moving forward with 
digital cinema, we respect the very founda-
tional work of classic cinema,” Kinman said.
Tickets for the show sold out within five 
days, so the theater added a second showing 
on Sunday, Kinman said. Tickets for the second showing are still 
available for $10 and come with a complimen-
tary bag of popcorn.
Cecilia Padilla, a 20-year-old UF theatre 
and English junior, said she is a frequent Hip-
podrome patron. She sees at least two shows a semester. 
She missed out on the chance to purchase 
a ticket for the Saturday showing and was relieved to hear that a Sunday showing had been added.
“‘Casablanca’ is such a significant film and 
is one of my favorites,” Padilla said. “I abso-lutely love the Hippodrome, and I can’t wait to see the showing.”Hippodrome theater to debut new projector with ‘Casablanca’

Gator basketball fans looking 
for a shot to support their team 
can do more than cheer at Satur-day’s Tennessee game.
UF is involved in two basket-
ball-themed online contests: the NCAA 6th Fan contest and the Infiniti Coaches’ Charity Chal-lenge.  
The NCAA 6th Fan contest is 
a competition that decides which school has the most supportive basketball fans.
Gabriella Razzetti, a 21-year-
old UF sport management senior, said the Gators’ success at home is due, in large part, to the fans.
“There’s no other arena like 
ours in the country,” she said, “and our fans and our school de-serve to be recognized as having an impact on the players and the game itself.”
Florida fans can vote for the 
Gators daily at 6thFan.NCAA.com and on Twitter by including the hashtags #6thFan and #FLA. The winning school, which will receive $100,000, will be an-nounced March 16.
UF is also involved in the 
fourth-annual Infiniti Coaches’ 
Charity Challenge, in which fans 
vote for men’s basketball coaches who are teamed up with a char-ity of their choice.
Gators coach Billy Donovan 
is partnering with the Sebastian Ferrero Foundation for the fourth consecutive year.
Donovan and the foundation 
won the inaugural challenge in 2011, raising money to contrib-ute to the ongoing renovation of the UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital.
Linda Michalisin, a spokes-
woman for Sebastian Ferrero Foundation, said Donovan has helped give the organization a national platform.     
“He’s been an incredible 
champion for the cause at help-ing to raise awareness,” she said.
First-round voting runs 
through Sunday, allowing voters to choose among 48 coach-and-charity pairs, which have already been guaranteed a donation of at least $1,000, according the con-
test’s website. 
Beside the winning charity’s 
grand prize, other participating 
charities will also receive smaller donations.
“What’s great about this pro-
gram is that all the participating charities benefit, not just the one with the most votes at the end,” 
Denver Parler, University Ath-
letic Association assistant direc-tor of communications, wrote in an email.
Fans can vote and find out 
more about the contest at ESPN.com/Infiniti. For more on the Se-bastian Ferrero Foundation, visit SebastianFerrero.org.

Research shows that listeners are more likely to 
stay tuned in if they hear familiar songs, and radio 
stations are responding with less variety than ever, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Kinnon Thomas, WUFT underwriter, said he has 
seen this firsthand is his various radio jobs. 
“Stations do like to stick to a tight playlist,” he 
said. “They may introduce maybe one or two new songs a week.”
Only about 5 percent of songs played on the ra-
dio are titles that have been released in the past six months, Thomas said.
That means in a rotation of 500 songs, about 25 
are new titles, and the rest of the songs are recur-ring — which means they’ve had six months or lon-ger of play time.
To keep listeners tuned in, radio stations admit 
to playing less variety because their ratings show that listeners want to hear the recurring and popu-lar titles more often, Thomas said.“If a radio station only played new titles,” he 
said, “they wouldn’t make it, wouldn’t have good ratings and definitely wouldn’t be the top radio sta-tion.”
This trend of keeping the same list of songs in ro-
tation may be a response to the popularity of stream-
ing music applications, according to the story.
With apps like Spotify and Pandora, listeners 
can easily discover and listen to new music when-
ever they want.
Victoria Cappelli, a 20-year-old UF public rela-
tions junior, said she mostly listens to new music with apps on her phone. 
“I like listening to new music,” she said, “but I 
don’t need the radio to discover it.”
When deciding on which new songs to release 
and whether to keep them in rotation, radio stations watch Billboard charts, record sales and SoundScan — a database that keeps track of music sales, Thom-as said. 
Cappelli said she interned at JVC Broadcasting 
in New York City. Through the internship, she was exposed to another way that program directors dis-cover new music: pitching.
Bands give program directors their albums in 
hopes that a single will make it onto the radio.
But, she said, “Most of the time, they wouldn’t 
even open the CD.”Oldies radio gets new meaning:

UF’s reputation as a party school may or may not be 
helping student enrollment numbers.
An 8- to 9-percent drop in out-of-state enrollment rates 
corresponds to colleges ranked as top party schools, the 
Hufﬁ  ngton Post recently reported. 
UF was most recently ranked as 2014’s No. 6 party 
school by The Princeton Review. 
But UF spokesman Steve Orlando said he doesn’t think 
rankings have any real impact on enrollment rates and that many may not be valid.
Orlando said that the ranking system is not difﬁ  cult to 
rig. 
“My understanding of the Princeton Review rankings 
is that they are done by student surveys,” he said. “It’s not very hard to work the system.”  
In addition, rankings can be invalid because they are 
skewed by UF’s old reputation as a party school, as ranked by Playboy magazine in the ‘60s and ‘70s.  
“I think there is sort of a historic lag,” Orlando said. 
“Sometimes it’s hard to get rid of a reputation that’s been 
around like that.”      
Josh Kimble, an 18-year-old UF political science 
freshman, said he was aware of UF’s party school 
reputation.
But it didn’t inﬂ  uence his college decision.          “I knew it was a pretty big party school,” he said. “But 
that had nothing to do with my decision to come here.”                                  
Orlando said he doesn’t think the rankings weigh too 
heavily on parents’ and students’ minds. 
He said students who may come to UF for the parties 
will quickly experience UF’s demanding “academic rigor.”      
“Students work hard here,” Orlando said. “If you’re 
looking for a party school where all you do is have a good time, you should look somewhere else.”       Party school rank

UF’s Club Creole will be cel-
ebrating its silver anniversary in 
style.
The annual Club Creole Gala 
Extravaganza will take place Sat-urday night at the Gainesville Country Club. The event will in-
clude performances, an auction, a 
guest speaker, dinner and danc-ing. 
Geraldine Placide, Club Cre-
ole’s internal vice president, said 
it’s the ﬁ  rst time the gala will focus 
more on Club Creole’s achieve-ments than on life in Haiti.“This year it’s more than just 
celebrating the culture,” Placide said. “It’s celebrating Club Cre-ole’s success on this campus.”
The club also expects many 
out-of-town visitors from other university across the state to come join the celebration, Placide said.
However the celebration will 
still pay tribute to its Haitian roots. The money raised through the auction will help support a 
medical mission trip to Haiti. 
The night before, at a pageant 
event, Mr. and Mrs. Club Creole 
will be chosen. 
At the gala, they will be formal-
ly presented. For the remainder of the year, they will work together to do community service and pro-mote Club Creole.
Emmanuela Etienne, a gala

This week, highlights of the most recent Student Senate 
meeting included talk of free sunscreen dispensers at Bro-
ward Outdoor Recreation Complex and the University Vil-
lage South volleyball courts. Um, what? Since when did students, most of whom are from the state of Florida and 
therefore know how the sun works, need RecSports to buy 
their sunscreen? And really, what’s more appealing than us-
ing hot, crusty sunscreen that’s been baking in a dispenser 
out next to some outdoor tennis and volleyball courts? Don’t insult us. Rub-on sunscreen belongs in the Stone Age next to dial-up Internet and scrunchies — spray-on sunscreen FTW. 
A DART to Student Senate for encouraging reckless spend-
ing, on sunscreen of all things. 
Today the Mars rover “Opportunity” celebrates its 10th 
year as the United States’ ambassador to the red planet. “Op-
portunity” was only supposed to last a few years, but the little rover that could is still soldiering on a decade later and pro-
viding the U.S. with important insight on the environmental 
conditions on Mars. 
According to USA Today, “the senior-citizen rover is still 
going strong — and after many frustrating years scouting 
sites far too acidic to host life, Opportunity has ﬁ  nally spotted 
a place where the conditions were once hospitable to living 
organisms.”
Because we love an underdog, a LAUREL to “Opportu-
nity,” which is still roving after all these years. 
On to more serious news, we need to talk about Justin Bie-
ber. Everyone’s least-favorite Canadian has been splashing 
headlines with some pretty idiotic antics lately, and some of 
them have ﬁ  nally landed him in the big house. Yesterday, the 
pop star was booked on charges of DUI and resisting arrest. Yep, the little man who has to be carried away by his handlers 
tried to resist arrest. Somewhere, Usher is shedding a single 
tear. This week, we’re throwing a your-mugshot-ain’t-even-cute DART to Justin Bieber. 
To close on some happier news, Gainesville resident Chris 
Cano, pioneer of pedal-powered community compost, will be speaking at national U.S. Composting Council Conference in 
Oakland, Calif., next week. 
“The model of moving waste out of town to be handled 
out of sight is not only infeasible in a lot of ways, but it’s un-
inspiring in a lot of ways,” Cano told the Alligator this week. 
“What we’re doing is inspiring. It’s showing people that there 
could be a better way.”
For that, we’re handing Cano and Gainesville Compost a 
you’re-in-the-big-leagues-now LAUREL. Good luck in Oak-
land!

Nearly a year later, no resolution for Syria
On Wednesday, delegates from 30 countries met in 
Switzerland for the Geneva II conference in a des-perate effort to create a solution for the chaos in 
Syria. 
As the Syrian Civil War approaches its third year, the 
only certain development is that there is no clear resolu-tion in sight. The Middle Eastern nation will most likely remain locked in conﬂ  ict and turmoil for the foreseeable future. As the conﬂ  ict becomes more and more compli-cated, any hope that a clear winner will emerge seems to be quickly vanishing. 
In the past six months, the situation has escalated again 
and again. Last August, reports surfaced that Syrian Presi-dent Bashar Assad’s forces used chemical weapons on civilians. We came close to being involved in the conﬂ  ict ourselves when, in response to these reports, our presi-dent asked Congress for permission to carry out military strikes in the country. And, even though we ended up de-ciding not to respond with bombs, the United States and the international community has been trying to intervene ever since. 
And, as talks approach, the situation keeps getting 
worse. What started as a series of street battles between government troops and protesters in 2011 now is a bloody, awful war; 18 different groups are ﬁ  ghting, and every one of them has its own goal. The rebels are not uniﬁ  ed any-more. Al-Qaida groups, attracted by the opportunity of winning the war, are ﬁ  ghting to carve an Islamic state out of Syria and Iraq. The Free Syrian Army, which was the main rebel group for a while, wants Assad overthrown and democracy restored. Assad and his supporters claim that they’re ﬁ  ghting terrorists. 
And, in the last month, the FSA and the al-Qaida 
groups have been slaughtering each other as much as they have been ﬁ  ghting government forces. On Monday, a re-port analyzing a few thousand photos taken by a Syrian military police photographer was published. It was de-termined that the photos show at least 11,000 prisoners that had been starved, savagely beaten and strangled by Assad’s army on what was referred to as an “industrial scale.” 
Getting the ﬁ  ghters to actu-
ally go to the conference has been like pulling teeth. No side 
wants to concede to the other. The FSA barely decided to go because they are opposed to any resolution that doesn’t involve the end of Assad’s presidency. Assad was ﬁ  nally persuaded to consider allowing humanitarian aid, as well as a possible ceaseﬁ  re in Aleppo, where a single battle has been fought since summer of 2012. And the jihadis have publicly stated that they see the conference as illegitimate, with one commander tweeting that anyone who attends will be placed on his “most-wanted list.”
Hopefully, the conference will bring about some sort 
of resolution to the conﬂ  ict. Even though the possibility of peace is, right now, almost nonexistent, Geneva II may be able to ease the hardships that face Syria’s civilian popula-tion. Relief for Syria’s civilians is long overdue, as it has been a point of concern for years.  Last March, UF Am-nesty International and Students For Justice in Palestine hosted the 70 Balloon Project, placing black balloons on  the Plaza of the Americas. Each balloon represented 1,000 Syrians killed in the war.  
Ten months later, nothing has happened to make 
things better. We can all hope that the ﬁ  ghters can ﬁ  nd some kind of common ground, at least for the sake of the civilians, and that they will work together toward some sort of resolution.  Without getting militaries involved, the international community must do whatever is necessary to ease the suffering of Syria’s people.

When I think of all the time I’ve wasted la-
menting over past failed relationships and wondering what I could have done differ-
ently in my search for the perfect partner, it’s hum-bling to realize the missing ingredient was as simple 
as a credit check. But even the rare and powerful combination of 
a physical and emotional attraction is no match for the binding super glue of love: a 750 credit score.
Within the ﬁ  rst several dates I ask a few simple ﬁ  nding ques-
tions like, “That’s a great car you have, did you get a three- or ﬁ  ve-year loan on that?” or “I’m sure glad my job covers tuition re-imbursement. Does your work cover reimbursement, or did you go the student loan route?” When worked naturally into a conversation, the answers to those questions can give a glimpse into their ﬁ  nancial liability. 
The second step in the process occurs within the 
ﬁ  rst few months of dating and involves surﬁ  ng the 
web together and randomly coming across a link for a website offering a free credit score followed by a suggestion that it would be a bonding experience to try it out together. While it may seem a bit invasive, it’s really a small price to pay before investing money in an engagement ring.

Quiz. The four-letter word alone 
is enough to ﬁ  ll a classroom with panic. But ﬂ  ash “quiz” across the 
screen anytime I’m on the Internet, and my eyes light up. 
Now you’re probably thinking, this 
girl is cray. And maybe I am a little bit, 
but before you start with the name-call-ing, let’s look at some numbers. 
Judging by more than 18 million views 
since Jan. 16, I’m not the only person who 
has ever pondered Buzzfeed’s pressing question: “What city should I actually live in?” 
If you haven’t taken the BuzzFeed quiz 
yourself, you’ve probably at least seen or heard about it. And although personality 
quizzes are no new form of entertainment, 
it seems they’ve been extra popular lately.
Even The New York Times piece that 
received the most trafﬁ  c last year was a quiz. “How Y’all, Youse and You Guys Talk,” an interactive quiz about dialects,  made No. 1 on the list of the publication’s most-visited stories after being published about two weeks before the end of 2013.
All too often, we hear about the media 
changing. And seeing a quiz rise to the top as the most-seen story of one of the most popular papers is a perfect example. Audi-ences are leaning toward more-interactive consumption of news, and quizzes offer publications another way to provide that for readers, along with a little fun.
But what is it about personality quizzes 
that makes them so hard to resist? It’s not as if choosing a Starbucks drink will accu-rately tell you how big your penis is. By the way, according to BuzzFeed, mine is huge. Choosing a favorite drink won’t accurately determine the NBA team you should be 
cheering for, yet our news feeds are lit-
tered with quiz results and reactions.
Those who have speculated about the 
reasons behind the popularity of person-ality quizzes have offered curiosity as an explanation, hence the reason I took the penis-size quiz.
But in all seriousness, sometimes you 
just have to know. I remember taking the 
dialects quiz the morning it was published 
because after seeing so many posts about accurate results, I had to know if the In-ternet could determine where I was from based on a few choice phrases.
One of the more interesting explana-
tions I found was Jordan Shapiro’s. He cited the psychological function of dis-placement as a reason for the continuous 
popularity of answering a few silly ques-
tions about favorites in hopes of determin-ing things like, say, a dwelling place.
According to Shapiro’s piece in Forbes 
about the virality of personality test, “dis-placement ... is an unconscious process through which the psyche transfers ener-gy, ideas, and emotions away from things that cause anxiety, and toward similar 
things that are superﬁ  cial, whimsical, and 
distracting.”
Maybe that means the anxiety you get 
from not knowing what you’re going to do after you graduate college will incline you to wonder which one of Jon Hamm’s massive bulges you are? I’m not sure. It’s probably different for all of us.
But right before I navigate toward an 
Internet quiz, I’m usually thinking, “I’m not understanding this macroeconomics question. Maybe I should ﬁ  nd out which Pixar movie I am.” That way I am ridding myself of anxiety while deciding between hypothetical creme brulee and doughnuts. And maybe that can work for you, too.

Surgeons at North Florida Re-
gional Medical Center can now 
perform surgeries using a highly precise robotic arm.
Released to the public last week, 
the Robotic Arm Interactive Ortho-pedic System, known as RIO, is the ﬁ  rst of its kind in Alachua County. The hospital purchased the ma-chine in December to perform knee and hip replacement surgeries that facilitate fast recovery and ensure longer-lasting implants than tradi-tional surgery methods. 
 Compared to other joint surger-
ies, patients are expected to recover two to three times faster and enjoy a “much more natural-feeling re-
placement” because the process pre-
serves patients’ natural ligaments, said Rob Greene, a territory sales manager for MAKO Surgical Corp., the company that created RIO.   
The joint-replacement proce-
dures will also allow surgeons to re-move bone mass more precisely in patients with osteoarthritis, reduc-ing pain and maintaining as much of the natural bone as possible. 
“The robot guarantees that the 
physician gets the implant in ev-ery time,” Greene said. “If you get the implant aligned correctly, then 
that’s going to be a much greater 
outcome and longevity for the im-plant.”
Conventional surgery for partial 
knee replacement requires surgeons to work freehand while removing bone mass, meaning more bone is removed than necessary, Greene 
said. The RIO takes a 3-D image 
from a computer-processed X-ray scan and conﬁ  nes the surgeon’s tool to the boundaries of the operating area.
The device will also expand the 
pool of candidates who can have surgeries, said Kenneth “Chip” Overstreet, assistant vice president of orthopedic services at the hospi-tal.
“It opens the door to younger 
patients,” he said. “If they catch you soon enough, you’re going to avoid a much greater surgery.”
Overstreet expects surgeries to 
begin in the next few weeks.

Lighting up may be worse than 
ever for smokers’ health.
A new report from the U.S. Sur-
geon General suggests that smok-
ing is now proven to be more dead-
ly than ever because of changes in 
the manufacturing process.
It has been 50 years since the 
Surgeon General released the ﬁ  rst tobacco-related report in 1964.  Since then, more than $20 million Americans have died because of smoking, according to the report.
“Cigarette manufacturers have 
redesigned cigarettes,” said Jane Emmerée, a GatorWell Health Pro-motion Services specialist.
The levels of chemicals in ciga-
rette smoke have increased as a result of the manufacturing pro-cesses, she said.
Emmerée said the report is sig-
niﬁ  cant because it offers enough evidence to make claims about the effects of smoking. 
It also provides information on 
ways to help students who suffer with addiction. 
“The report added new disor-
ders that we didn’t have enough evidence for,” Emmerée said. “The preponderance of evidence keeps growing stronger and stronger.”
Amber Medina, a 22-year-old 
UF chemistry junior, said that as a smoker, she worries about health complications that may arise.
Medina said although smoking 
is restricted now, she thinks its ta-boo is what makes it appeal more to a younger generation than it did in the ‘50s and ‘60s.
“Tobacco is now cut with a lot of 
pesticides,” she said. “That scares me.”Smoking danger growsIt allows for precise surgery“The robot guarantees 
that the physician gets the 
implant in every time.”

The Norman Education Library has shortened its week-
end hours during the Spring semester. The library that once 
remained open until 6 p.m. on Friday and Saturday now closes at 5 p.m.
“We wanted to take a look at what our peak hours are,” said 
Tiffany Baglier, a visiting assistant librarian at the education li-brary. “We realized that the hours that we cut, really we don’t have that many patrons at that time.”The education library staff decided those excess hours were 
unnecessary due to lack of students studying and librarians available for assistance.
For now, staff members plan on using the new schedule of 
hours this Spring as a trial. A permanent decision on the hours of the library in future semesters will not be made until the end of the semester, Baglier said. 
But some students may ﬁ  nd these changes inconvenient.“Six was already super early, and it’s right by my house so 
it was really nice to go there and to not have to go all the way to Library West,” said Jeff Diamond, a 21-year-old UF biology junior.
For students like Diamond who live east of Southwest 13th 
Street, the education library is the closest study spot.
“I think I’ll go to West more than Norman now,” Diamond 
said. “That’s going to suck because there is going to be more people there, and it’ll be crowded.”Weekend hours for Norman Education Library shortened
“We realized that the hours that we cut, really 
we don’t have that many patrons at that time.”

Although No. 6 Florida has moved 
away from being a traditional three-point 
shooting team this season, it needed to 
return to its old ways during Thursday 
night’s 68-62 win over Alabama.
The Gators (16-2, 5-0 Southeastern 
Conference) struggled to break into the 
paint against the Crimson Tide’s (8-10, 
2-3 SEC) 2-3 zone early and turned to Michael Frazier II to bail them out from beyond the arc.
Frazier, who was held scoreless for 
the first time this season Saturday against 
Auburn, started the game 1 of 6 from 
three but found his stroke to finish the contest 4 of 7. The sophomore guard’s 13 attempts were the most in his career. 
“He’s just got to keep shooting it,” 
coach Billy Donovan said. “He had really, really good looks. And this could’ve been a game with his shooting that he could’ve, by himself, shot them out of the zone. I think he could’ve even had a bigger night and could’ve taken more threes.”
All of Frazier’s field goals were three-
pointers, but he added three free throws to end the night with 18 points. One of his free throws came as a part of a four-point play with 4.6 seconds remaining in the 
first half.

� GATORS STRUGGLED TO HIT THREES.

Rebounding the ball was not an issue on 
Thursday night for the Gators, but rebounding 
from their current losing streak is. 
In front of a crowd of 10,541 in Thompson-
Boling Arena, Florida dropped its third consecu-tive Southeastern Conference contest to No. 11 Tennessee (15-4, 4-2 SEC), losing 89-69.
The Lady Volunteers were sharp offensively 
on the night, shooting 50.8 percent from the field and 10 of 21 from three-point range. 
Senior guard Meighan Simmons spearheaded 
the Lady Volunteers’ offensive effort, scoring a 
game-high 21 points, thanks to a 5-of-10 perfor-
mance from beyond the arc. 
“They had some kids that stepped up and hit 
shots that don’t typically do that,” coach Aman-
da Butler said. 
“That’s always subject to happen when you’re 
playing such a talented team. Meighan Simmons 
hitting five though, that’s not a surprise. We didn’t do a very good job. We were in a situation 
where sometimes had to play them in zone and 
just didn’t do a good job with the level of aware-ness. She gets it off very quick and she’s going to make you pay if she gets a good look.”
Things got out of hand early for the Gators 
(13-6, 3-3 SEC), who fell behind 20-8 with 13:32 remaining in the first half.  
At halftime, the Volunteers were leading 40-
27, and UF was 0 of 8 from three-point range. 
“There were parts of the game that we just 
didn’t play well,” Butler said. 
“I know that may be oversimplifying it, but 
there were times when we took bad shots or shots 
that didn’t appear we believed in.”Florida drops

For the first time in 2014, the Gators will 
have home-floor advantage. 
No. 3 Florida (2-0, 1-0 Southeastern 
Conference) hosts No. 6 Georgia (2-2, 1-0 
SEC) in the O’Connell Center tonight at 7. 
“The team is just so looking forward to running out of the 
tunnel,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “We just love 
competing at home.”  
Though the Gators 
are the reigning champi-
ons, they believe there is room for improvement. 
Tonight’s meet will mark Florida’s next step in climbing to the top 
from a less than stellar season opener against UCLA. 
The team improved 0.425 points from 
196.65 against the Bruins to a score of 197.075 against Auburn on Jan. 17, and it will look to do better against the Bulldogs  tonight.
“There’s such a difference between if you’re competing at home or on the road and who you’re competing in the lineups and it’s just so early in the season,” Faehn 
said. “Usually, later in the season when it 
starts to go by your [regional qualifying score], and it gets a better average ... that’s when it starts to take a little bit more ef-fect. Gators to make home debut after starting season with two wins

UF defensive back“So for right now, I’m not focusing on that.”
Faehn said she does not look too far ahead in the 
season. Tonight is a matter of focusing on Florida’s 
task at hand: Georgia. 
UF faced Georgia four times in 2013 — once dur-
ing the regular season, which Florida won (197.30-
196.175), and three times in postseason meets. 
While Florida won its second consecutive SEC 
title (198.00), Georgia finished fourth (197.325) in the conference. 
The teams met in both NCAA Championships’ 
semifinal (Florida 197.775, Georgia 197.15) and 
NCAA Super Six (Florida 197.575, Georgia 196.675) 
competition.
The Bulldogs have had a busy January. Georgia 
competed four times in a span of a little more than 
three weeks. 
After losing its first two meets of the year, UGA 
is coming to Gainesville on a two-game winning 
streak — the same as UF.
While Florida’s Bridget Sloan won SEC Gymnast 
of the Week on Monday, Georgia’s Chelsea Davis and Kiera Brown snagged both of the SEC’s other two weekly individual awards: Event Specialist of the Week and Freshman of the Week, respectively. 
Davis contributed a career-best 9.975 on bars and 
a 9.9 on vault to aid in Georgia’s takedown of No. 2 LSU on Jan. 17. 
For Florida’s two freshmen, tonight’s meet will 
be a foreign experience. Both Silvia Colussi-Pelaez 
and Claire Boyce have competed for UF on the road, 
but they have only ever practiced in the O’Connell Center. 
“It’s going to be something they’ve never experi-
enced before,” Faehn said. 
“I think it will kind of open up a whole new level 
for them that they haven’t seen before. That’s where they’ll start to gain the appreciation for loving com-peting at home.”
Colussi-Pelaez put up her first official numbers 
on floor (9.725) against Auburn, while Boyce com-peted balance beam and floor at both meets. 
“I told them to expect the unexpected,” Sloan 
said. “I told them to just be aware that the crowd will be very respectful, they are a very respectful crowd. And they applaud great gymnastics.”
started 1 of 8 from three only to 
knock down the next four, for-ward Dorian Finney-Smith said 
the team trusted Frazier even 
more than he trusted himself.
Following Thursday night’s 
win, Finney-Smith echoed his 
message from more than a 
week ago.
“If he misses seven in a row, 
we still got confidence in him that he’s going to make the next 
one,” he said. 
“We get mad at him and ev-
erybody says to him, ‘Just keep 
shooting.’ Mike Frazier’s the 
type that he just hits five in a 
row out of nowhere.”
Coming into Thursday 
night’s matchup, only 30.3 per-cent of the Gators’ shots were 
three-pointers, which is the 
school’s lowest since KenPom.com started recording the stat in 2003. But Florida was forced 
to shoot 46 percent of its shots 
from beyond the arc against Alabama.
The Gators’ 28 attempted 
threes were the most this sea-
son, and their 17 attempted 
threes in the first half were the most to open a game since their 63-60 loss to Missouri on Feb. 
19.Although Florida only 
landed 10 threes, Alabama had 
to settle for just two the entire game, which tied a season low.
“Our 10 threes really offset 
the fact that they made two,” Donovan said. “When you’re playing zone, you have a chance to give up a lot of threes, and we made 10 of them even 
though we took 28. They were 
there.”
The Crimson Tide’s zone 
prevented the Gators’ front-
court in Finney-Smith, Patric 
Young and Will Yeguete from doing anything offensively. The three big men totaled only 17 combined points.
However, their  rebounding 
kept Florida in the game when Frazier and company strug-gled to make shots early in the 
game.
Together, Finney-Smith 
and Yeguete recorded 22 of the 
Gators’ 42 rebounds, including 10 of the team’s 18 offensive 
boards.
“Those guys got to the back-
board, which was encourag-
ing,” Donovan said. “When 
you’re a frontcourt player 
against zone, you’ve got to get it off the backboard.”

Florida lost despite keeping up with tall Tennessee on boards
Things did not get any easier for Butler’s team in the second 
half. 
Fewer than five minutes in, the Lady Vols stretched their lead 
to 19 points with the score at 53-34. 
Despite Florida’s valiant effort to get within eight points of 
Tennessee with 11:20 remaining in the game, the Gators fell 
apart, ultimately losing by a 20-point margin. 
Florida committed only four more turnovers than Tennessee 
and also was within one rebound of the Lady Volunteers. 
“We didn’t have a ton of turnovers, but it seemed like we had 
them at crucial times,” Butler said. 
Tennessee had a considerable size advantage on Florida and 
was ranked third in the nation in rebound margin heading into Thursday night’s affair. Although the Gators lost the rebound-ing battle, it was only by a total of 38-37. 
“I guess we can take some consolation in that,” Butler said. 
“Part of what we wanted to do was try to neutralize that re-bounding. 
“Again, the rebounds that we gave up seemed to be so timely. 
When we were fighting back, we cut the lead all the way back to single digits. And then just to give up such big plays like that in 
the paint was really difficult.”
Florida has now found itself in the midst of a three-game los-
ing streak, which happens to come off the heels of a nine-game 
winning streak. 
A key factor in the current slide could be the absence of sus-
pended sophomore forward Christin Mercer. Mercer has not played since Florida’s home win over Arkansas — its last vic-tory before the current skid — leaving the Gators with only eight active players.

In relays, the anchor position 
is given to the fastest or most 
experienced competitor on a 
team.
Sophomore sprinter Arman 
Hall has earned that role in 
the 4x400-meter relay, holding 
the responsibility to make up 
ground on the race-leader or preserve the lead already se-cured by his teammates.
As the UF track and ﬁ  eld 
team prepares for its second in-door meet of the season in Lex-ington, Ky., Hall is conﬁ  dent he and his team will perform up to 
lofty standards set by previous 
squads. 
“Being the anchor of the 4x4, 
people don’t really think that’s a lot of pressure,” Hall said. 
“But in reality, think about the 
race on the line, and you have to get a certain place to even win the race or whole confer-
ence or nationals.
“I’m happy that my team 
shows that they have a lot of 
conﬁ  dence in me to anchor it in. Pretty much be the quarter 
horse. 
“They know I’ll do what I 
have to do done. I’ll run to the 
last bit of my breath and run till 
my legs fall out.”Hall was named the South-
eastern Conference Men’s Run-
ner of the Week on Jan. 14, run-ning the anchor leg of Florida’s 4x400 relay at the UAB Invite 
on Jan. 10-11 that clocked the 
fastest time in the nation this season with a 3:06.11.
Hall also recorded a person-
al record of 20.80 in the men’s 
200-meter at the UAB Invite, 
winning the event and logging the 10th-fastest 200m time in program history.
Hall said he has wanted to 
be an anchor since his freshman year in high school at Fort Lau-derdale St. Thomas Aquinas High. 
Coach Mike Holloway ﬁ  rst 
approached Hall about the po-sition and offered him the op-portunity to be an anchor while Hall was still being recruited, 
and he wanted to prove to Hol-
loway that he can trust him and not have to look for someone else to ﬁ  ll the role. 
“You want somebody on 
the anchor that is not afraid, somebody that can either go get someone if they have to or someone that can hold the lead when you give it to them,” Hol-loway said. 
“Arman is that guy. People 
look at him and think he’s only 19 years old or he was only 18 last year when he started an-
choring. 
“It has nothing to do with 
that. He’s a guy that believes 
he’s the best out there, so I have no problem putting him on my 
anchor.”
In addition to Hall, two other 
Gators earned SEC honors last 
week. Sophomore Robin Reyn-
olds was named the SEC Wom-
en’s Field Athlete of the Week, while freshman Taylor Tubbs was honored as the SEC Wom-en’s Freshman of the Week.
At the UAB Invite, Reynolds 
clocked in a ﬁ  rst-place ﬁ  nish and a personal best in the long jump with a 6.38m/20-11.25. 
Tubbs ran a mile in 4:59.77, ﬁ  n-
ishing second.
After two weeks of practice, 
Hall and the Gators will com-pete today and Saturday at the 
Rod McCravy Memorial in Lex-
ington. Florida excelled at its last meet, winning 13 events.
“I’m a big proponent of prac-
tice make permanent; there’s no such thing as perfect,” Hollo-way said. 
“If we’re going to be at our 
best, we have to be at our best 
in practice.”FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The No. 2 Florida women’s tennis team begins its sea-
son as hosts of the ITA Kickoff opening rounds this Satur-
day at the Ring Tennis Complex.  
Louisville, Missouri 
and Harvard will trav-el to Gainesville for a chance to be entered 
in the National Team Indoor Championships held Feb. 7-10 in Charlottesville, Va. The winner from each second-round match this weekend will advance to the national tournament.
The Gators come off the 2012-2013 season with a 26-3 
(12-1 Southeastern Conference) record in which they won the SEC Championship but fell short of winning a third straight NCAA title after losing in the semiﬁ  nals to Stan-ford.
“I really like this team,” coach Roland Thornqvist 
said. “I think we’ve gotten better each month and I like the depth. All seven are going to be contributing every time we play.”
The Gators are heavy favorites in their season opener 
against Louisville. 
“We’ve been in situations like this before, at least I 
have,” said senior Alexandra Cercone, who spent her off-season competing in pro-circuit tournaments. “We have 
to be prepared though, because sometimes the underdog 
will come in and play very free because they have no pressure on them.”
More than half the team spent the past two weeks 
competing in tournaments. However, freshmen Kourtney 
Keegan, Stefani Stojic and Belinda Woolcock will experi-
ence their ﬁ  rst collegiate dual match this weekend.
“Four of our seven players have already played and 
competed this spring and they’ve done well,” Thornqvist 
said. “But three of them are going to be thrown in there 
for the ﬁ  rst time. The wildcards are always going be your ﬁ  rst-year players.”
Thornqvist expects the seniors to carry the leader-
ship role and help the three freshman, two of which are ranked in the top 40 nationally, become more comfortable on the court.
“We don’t verbalize [our goals] a lot, but it’s under-
stood that we strive for excellence,” Cercone said. “Per-sonally, I want to be a good leader and a good teammate, just because it helps team morale and that helps when we are playing matches.”
The team plans to replicate the success it has had in 
years past by relying on its talent; six players on this year’s tennis squad are ranked in the top 40 nationally. Thornqvist thinks the team’s depth will help the Gators 
tremendously in doubles.
“I really feel good about our doubles,” Thornqvist 
said. “I think we have multiple pairings at each spot that 
can win, which helps us. I’m excited to see them play this weekend and see if there is anything in particular we 
need to pay attention to in the coming weeks.”

Coming off a 5-2 victory against UNF, coach Bryan 
Shelton and the Gators look to improve to 2-0 as they 
take on UNC-Wilmington on Saturday at 2 p.m. at the 
ITA Kickoff at the Ring Tennis Complex.
Shelton was pleased with the way his team played 
on Wednesday.
“For our home opener, we certainly felt the nerves 
out there on the court and it was a good match to get 
through that,” he said.
Despite the win, Shelton sees many areas in which 
his team needs to improve. 
Freshman standout Elliott Orkin and his doubles 
partner Gordon Watson are also excited to have a chance to redeem themselves after losing 6-2 in their match against UNF. The duo went into the match ranked 13th nationally in doubles.
“I just think we weren’t playing aggressive enough,” 
Orkin said. “We weren’t making the balls that we nor-mally make.
“[Wednesday] was a little dip in our normal results, 
but we’ll be back at it this weekend.” 
Orkin won his singles match — a two-hour duel 
against UNF’s Yannick Zuern that went to three sets. He attributed his success Wednesday to advice his older teammates gave him.
“They gave me some tips before the match, things to 
expect in my ﬁ  rst match,” Orkin said. “I took that into 
consideration and took it with me into the match.” 
Shelton described UNC-Wilmington as a tough 
loaded team that always comes to play.
