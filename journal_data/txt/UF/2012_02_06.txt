  MARIETTA, Ga. — Apostle Aron Amazonas stood 
in front of his congregation members and tried to soothe 
their hearts.
  “It’s important for us to cry for them,” he said Sunday. 
“We’re having our time of mourning. But not everything died.”
  While he spoke, the members of the International 
Church of the Restoration clutched tissues and patted their eyes. Some wore braces from still-healing injuries.
  For this church, there are some wounds that doctors 
just can’t heal.
  A week ago Sunday, the 120-member Brazilian church 
lost ﬁ  ve cherished members in an Interstate 75 crash in Gainesville. Smoke from a Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park brush ﬁ  re blinded drivers and 11 lives were lost. At least 20 went to the hospital.
  Since then, the congregation has been coming to terms 
with concepts of life, death and faith. In a town where even fast-food restaurants play Christian rock, people turn to the church ﬁ  rst — to seek healing and understand-ing, even if the answers don’t ever seem to come.
  “The Bible says our natural mind can’t understand the 
hand of God,” the head pastor said. “The Bible says there is a season to be born, and a season to die ... a season to laugh, and a season to cry.”
  A woman sobbed quietly. Another woman furrowed 
her brow and prayed.
  Joilson Lima, 34-year-old youth pastor and a survivor 
of the wrecks, squeezed another church member’s hand when she put it on his shoulder. He wore a neck brace and a look of silent grief.
  “They can’t come back to us anymore,” the pastor con-
tinued, pointing to the ceiling. “But, one day, we will meet them.”

  Businesses in Gainesville are finding 
creative ways to keep talented computer 
programming students in town.
  The most productive programmers can 
have a six-figure job secured by their junior year, and most students can earn a job that pays $50,000 to $60,000 after graduation, said Amir Rubin, organizer of a hackathon event put on by the Florida Innovation Hub at UF and some of its companies.
  “A hacker means someone who can 
make something work,” he said. “The great hackers don’t do it for the money; they do it for the creation and the joy of it.”
  About 35 participants, mostly UF stu-
dents, put their coding skills on display for companies to see Saturday in a 12-hour marathon coding session.
  The Florida Innovation Hub at UF, 747 
SW Second Ave., is part of the Innovation Square project that helps companies start-ed at UF and around the state grow and succeed.
  Competitors were given five computer-
related scenarios to solve, or they could bring in their own.
  “When you get together and do cool 
things, it builds the community,” said Joe Thuemler, a 20-year-old math major.
  He has been coding for six years and was an intern at Microsoft.
  Thuemler and his team of two other UF 
students are making HypeFrog, a program used for presenting coding projects. 
The program optimizes the projects for 
the web and makes the presentation as-pect easier.
  “This is an example of what I am going 
to be doing in the workplace,” he said.
  At the event, software companies such 
as Totuit, Shadow Health and Feathr were out recruiting.  “Because there are big names in the 
community here, you want to sell your-self,” Thuemler said. “These people could be hiring you in the very near future.”
  Rubin, organizer of the hackathon 
and UF computer engineering alumnus, agrees.
  Programming interns in the Gainesville 
community can be paid anywhere from $500 to $2,000 a month, he said.
  At the competition, about seven tech-
nology companies were looking for in-terns to hire and keep in the Gainesville area, he said.
  Tucker-Davis Technologies, UF’s Cen-
ter for Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Infinite Energy donated $500 each for prize money, he said.
  “They are putting in a lot of money just 
to reach out to students,” Rubin said.  Innovation Hub hosts ‘hackathon’ to ﬁ  nd local talent

Feb. 7, 1973: Negotiations reached a stalemate be-
tween UF’s off-campus housing director and the Vil-
lage Apartments over complaints presented by stu-dent residents in the complex. Complaints came after the former tenants arrived at the complex to discover that work on certain promised facilities, including a paved road and cable TV , had not begun. The com-plex’s manager countered that former tenants failed to give notice before leaving and return their keys.
Feb. 10, 1986: With only two days left before 
Student Government elections, two party-affiliated candidates and two independent candidates tried to familiarize more students with their platforms. The Beach Party platform included a promised to create a movie/VCR rental service in the Reitz Union, while the Florida Student Party candidate and one inde-pendent promised to create a computerized drop/add procedure.
Feb. 10, 1999: A UF student was picked to be on 
WebDorm, a website that broadcasted video from student dormitory rooms across the country. The stu-dent, Cody Ward, already ran a website displaying a picture of his Weaver Hall dorm room updated ev-ery 15 seconds. “Maybe I’ll get on [MTV’s] the ‘Real World’ or something,” he said.

Members of the Gainesville Chinese School perform the Chinese yo-yo Saturday evening at the Chinese American Student Association’s Chi-nese New Year show, “Awaken the Dragon.”
MATT BOLES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Some UF students celebrated the New 
Year last month with tipsy kisses and cham-
pagne, but a group in the Reitz Union rang it in with a lion dance and kung fu this week-end.
The Chinese American Student Asso-
ciation rang in the Year of the Dragon in the Grand Ballroom on Saturday night. Its “Awaken the Dragon” show celebrated the Chinese New Year, which lasts from from Jan. 23 to Feb. 9, 2013, according to the Chi-nese calendar. 
The eight featured performances ranged 
from singing to skits and lion dances. 
CASA President Angel Cheong estimated 
about 400 people attended. 
The group hosts the event each year, said 
Jason Liu, CASA historian and 19-year-old sociology freshman. He said they market the celebration to all students, not just the orga-nization’s members.
“It’s definitely good for people to learn 
how different cultures do things,” said Mi-chael Demaio, a 25-year-old philosophy ju-nior.
Demaio said though he is not Chinese he 
is interested in the cultures of China, South Korea and Japan. He is a member of CASA and the Filipino Student Association.
The show brought cultural awareness 
to Gainesville, said Kevina Lee, a 21-year-old journalism junior and editor-in-chief of Sparks Magazine, an Asian-interest maga-zine at UF.
“It really shows we come together to bring 
cultural awareness to this campus,” she said.

Tom and Stephanie walk through a door 
covered in peeling brown paint and leave be-
hind the ordinary . 
They play queen and king at the Hog-
getowne Medieval Faire, presiding over the live-action chess match. It plays out like a drama in which they both have key roles. 
“It’s good to be the king,” said Henry II, 
played by Tom Dalton, 43.
The king and queen are from Gainesville 
and Lake City, respectively. Dalton is a net-work engineer and Stephanie Tyson is a li-brarian.
They’ve been members of the Thieves 
Guilde, the acting troupe that works at the fair every year, for a combined seven years.
The chess match includes fight scenes, wit-
ty dialogue and complex costumes. Inside a staging area, members of the troupe rehearse scenes and stunts and give each other point-ers on things like holding weapons and roll-ing without injury . 
Dalton is a 6-foot-7 ex-basketball center for 
Osceola High School in Seminole.
“I never would have seen myself doing 
this in high school,” he said. “I was not a dra-ma guy.”
He’s in a purple shirt. On his head is a simple crown. On his back, a black and silver cape lined with silver diamond-shaped studs. He’s proud of his decision to be the king.
Next to Dalton, sitting in a fold-up lawn 
chair, is 6-foot Stephanie Tyson. She’s in a purple-and-beige dress with gold-and-white sleeves. She jokes with other cast members, but once outside and in character, they are measly peasants.
She’s been an actor for about a decade and 
loves performing for others.
Tyson has played a lead role three out of 
the four years she has been with the Thieves Guilde. 
The duo’s day jobs are a far cry from the 
fantasy of the fair. Tyson tells stories to mid-dle and high school students, and Dalton works in the IT department at Main Street Broadband. 
“By day , I configure routers, and on the 
weekend I am a smart-ass king,” Dalton said.
He found the troupe when his 16-year-old 
daughter wanted to learn stage combat, which the guild specializes in.
“Any time your teenage child asks you if 
you want to do something together for the next eight weeks, you say yes,” he said.
Actors audition in September and start re-
hearsing in October for the fair, usually held around the beginning of the year.

Marietta pastor says God will use community's pain for good
  
The night of the accident, before they left Orlando, Aron 
Amazonas wished the Carmos a safe drive. He prayed over 
his second family, asking God to lead them safely home.
He wrapped his arms around Jose Carmo Jr., his next-
door neighbor and fellow pastor, and said goodbye to the rest of the family: Adriana Carmo, Jose’s wife, and 17-year-old Leticia Carmo, the couple’s elder daughter.
The younger Carmo daughter, 15-year-old Lidiane, wan-
dered the halls and missed the prayer.
Amazonas looked into their faces and bid Jose, Adriana 
and Leticia goodbye for the last time. Then they left. The drive from the Christian conference in Orlando to Cobb County, Ga., would take all night.
Jose wanted to get back to the church in Marietta, Ga. He 
didn’t want to let his members down by missing the Sunday service.
As the church’s two vans cruised down Interstate 75 on 
Jan. 29, the fatigued passengers were rocked to sleep by a slight sway. The smoke from a prairie fire blinded the driv-ers.
It was 4 a.m. as they entered the darkest week their church 
has known. A church speaker would later call it the church’s valley of shadows on the way to green pastures.
Up ahead, a chain reaction of wreck after wreck started.Their van slammed into a semitrailer, killing Jose, Adri-
ana, Leticia and two other church members: Edson Carmo, Jose’s brother, and Roselia DeSilva, Edson’s girlfriend.
David Pimentel, a 31-year-old church member who sur -
vived a crash in the second van, said he rushed to Jose’s van to see if they were OK.
He could only see half of a foot in front of him. The in-
jured limped along the highway.
He looked in the van and saw the dead.Then, movement. David grabbed a nearby emergency worker and shouted, 
“Just come here. We have someone alive.”
As workers pried the van open with the Jaws of Life, they 
saw Lidiane sprawled on top of her parents’ bodies.
“Leticia,” Lidiane moaned. “Leticia. Leticia. Leticia.”
  
Sitting in Jose’s office, Aron told the story of how the Car -
mos met. The first time Jose saw Adriana, he told her he was going to marry her.
“You’re crazy,” she told him. “Who are you? I don’t know 
you.”
The smitten young man looked at her and said he would visit daily until he won her over.
He charmed her parents and slowly stole the shy girl’s 
heart.
They were married in Goiania, Brazil. A Christian up-
bringing and a father in the clergy led Jose to become a pas-tor.
Their home was soon filled with the laughter of their two 
daughters.
They came to Georgia in 1999 to work in a series of small 
churches. Jose started his own flooring business, but he gave that up because he felt God was calling him.
Five years ago, Aron moved from Miami to Kennesaw, 
Ga. He said Jose was more than willing to help him move into his new home.
The house next door was up for sale. They decided to be-
come neighbors.
Leticia started to bond with the Amazonas family. She 
would come home from Sprayberry High School, drop off her backpack and make a beeline for the Amazonas home.
She’d spill out her heart to Aron, who helped her deal 
with boy drama and future college concerns. At some point, she started calling him “second Daddy.”
She wanted to be a model, a singer, a doctor — she envi-
sioned a full, exciting life. She took cosmetology classes and begged to have photos taken of her. The Amazonas family’s camera is full of her portraits.
“The thing that hurts in my heart for her,” Aron said, “is 
that she was so young, and she had so many dreams.”
Lidiane takes after her mother and doesn’t thrive off at-
tention like her sister did. Aron said he’s worried about how she’ll deal with the TV cameras and media interviews that will inevitably come her way.
When any Sunday service ended and Leticia headed to the 
Amazonas’ home, Lidiane would go home to her parents. 
“I felt a deep pain in my heart for her because I know how 
close she was to her parents,” Aron said.
After Lidiane was taken to Shands at UF, she slipped into 
a coma. Her ribs and arm were broken. Her liver and lungs were badly damaged. There was internal bleeding.
Aron said the doctor told him that after the accident, her 
condition wasn’t looking good.
“She’s very bad,” he said the doctor told him. “If she 
doesn’t react in two hours, she’ll pass away.”
Aron rallied his congregation and called their mother 
church in Brazil. Soon, thousands of people were praying. They needed a miracle.She woke up Monday morning looking for her sister.
  
A week after her loss, Lidiane is being cared for by her 
uncle, Fabio Souza, who treated her and Leticia like they were his own. 
Lidiane remained tucked into a Shands hospital bed, her 
aunt watching over her, while her uncle traveled to Georgia Sunday to tell her church that she's OK.
Aron said she is conscious and knows who she is. In the 
coming months, she’ll learn who she must become to deal with this loss, he said.
While Lidiane rests safely in her hospital bed, her uncle is 
working to help untangle a web of immigration issues.
The Carmo family’s visas have expired. For a few days 
last week, the church was worried Lidiane, who has lived in Georgia since she was 2 years old, would be deported to Brazil.
But Aron wants Lidiane to come home to her uncle, aunt, 
classmates and, most important, her second family.
During the service, the congregation sang about love.“He is jealous for me,” they sang. “Loves like a hurricane. 
I am a tree. Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.”
During his sermon, Aron said God will use the church’s 
pain to plant a seed, which will grow and blossom into great plans.
"We’re going to look into the future God has. The best God 
has is yet to come,” he said. “We’re going to look at Lidiane and we’re going to know that God has the greatest project that’s left in our lives.”
Aron said it will cost $51,000 to ship the bodies from Flor -
ida to Marietta, Ga., for a memorial service and then to Brazil for a family burial.
Sunday morning, exactly a week after the accidents, the 
marred section of I-75 is slowly being repaired, the injured are returning home and investigations into the deaths loom.
The church, too, will heal with time.“The services in the church will go on,” the pastor told the 
congregation. “Everything will go on.”
The song continued: “If grace is an ocean, we’re all sink-
ing.”
While Lidiane rested and her church grieved, a downpour 
blanketed this small Southern town, as if watering the seeds left behind.

Freedom of Debate
High school paper right 
to discuss gay rights   
The issue of gay rights can rarely be debated without stir -
ring up some controversy — especially if religion gets 
tossed into the mix. 
The editorial page of Hawk’s Post, the student newspaper at 
Shawano High School in Shawano, Wis., featured a point-coun-terpoint column discussing the issue of gay adoptions. 
One column argued that sexual orientation has nothing to do 
with a person’s ability to raise children. The opposing column not only argued that same-sex parents should not be allowed to adopt, but also that homosexuality is a sin punishable by death. 
Guess which column upset everyone? Nick Uttecht, who is raising four children with his partner 
Michael McNelly, complained to the school district that the col-umn was hateful and could encourage bullying directed at chil-dren with same-sex parents. 
District Superintendent Todd Carlson told USA Today that 
“offensive articles cultivating a negative environment of disre-spect are not appropriate or condoned” by the school district. He went on to say that he was “taking steps to prevent” this from happening again. 
While the column attacking homosexuality was certainly of-
fensive, this incident should not lead to censorship or adminis-trative oversight of the student newspaper by this high school.   
 Students should be allowed to have this discussion, and the 
school should recognize that the author of this offensive article wrote these backward and distasteful statements not out of ha-tred, but from genuine religious beliefs. 
The editors of the paper, on the other hand, probably should 
have advised the columnist to reform his language, noting that calling someone a sinner is a poor way to persuade others to support his or her argument.
However, if the district does not allow students in a high 
school setting to discuss controversial issues in an open forum, then this could truly lead to a step back on the issue of freedom, in terms of both speech and sexual rights. 
Students opposed to homosexuality or gay marriage would 
not be given the opportunity to hear counterarguments, creating an impenetrable wall against persuasion. And the district should certainly not allow pro-equality columns while censoring those on the other side. 
Contrary to the beliefs of psychology professors like Chris-
tine Smith of University of Wisconsin-Green Bay who said that debates like this could have “devastating” effects, high school students are old enough to discuss these issues. 
Not allowing them the ability to do so would be an assault 
on freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of thought. 
The most offensive speech, especially political speech, always 
deserves the most protection.

them” at the end of the print version of last Friday’s column “Colum-nist shows elitism when addressing classroom, religion”  should not have appeared.) UF needs better investment strategy
Is there anything UF could do to raise funds for higher 
education in Florida during this tough-budget envi-ronment? The go-to answers are to raise tuition, raise 
new taxes or get some rich people to donate money, but there is an answer that might not be as obvious: Use the fees charged to UF’s endowment fund. 
For those of you who couldn’t care less about invest-
ing, our university uses a part of its $1.3 billion (as of June 30) endowment that it uses to fund activities and scholar-ships that couldn’t reasonably come from public funds or tuition dollars. 
Prior to 1960, many colleges invested money in bonds 
for the stability of their money as well as modest incomes. Gradually, higher educational institutions moved toward investing their funds in stocks of public corporations. However, it was the practices of the Ivy League schools that changed how universities managed their donations from alumni and others. 
In 1985, David Swenson began his tenure as the chief 
investment officer for Yale and he moved the institution’s money heavily into hedge funds, private equity, private real estate deals and other alternative investments. All of these types of investments were not widely used and most of the public had not heard of hedge funds. He was enormously successful in his decision and all the other Ivy League schools followed. After a period of time in the early 2000s, many universities, UF included, moved a big chunk of their money toward these high-risk, high-fee in-vestments.
As of its most recent report from June 30, UF has close 
to 60 percent of its endowment money in things besides stocks and bonds. Many experts feel that bonds are going to return nothing after inflation for the next decade. All you have to do is look at the interest you get paid on your savings account to see that. 
Because of low interest rates, some feel that the only 
way universities like UF can spend the way UF has is to take more risks with its endow-ment. The problem is that all these fancy investments carry very high fees. UFICO, which manages the endowment, takes a 1.3 percent cut annually. Af-ter that, some of the investors the endowment gives money to charge 2 percent flat fees on top of 20 percent of all positive 
returns. It is probably a conservative estimate to guess that we spend away 3 to 4 percent of our total endowment money each year on fees alone. This comes to somewhere between $39 million to $51 million in fees.
UFICO does not release information on how much 
it pays in fees, so there is no way of knowing what the true cost of its investment strategy is. Its argument would probably be that the only way to generate large returns for the future is to invest like it has, but the endowment’s mediocre five-year performance of 5.4 percent could have been beaten for a cost of less than 0.10 percent of the en-dowment, or $1.3 million total, with a simple portfolio of 50 percent U.S. stocks and 50 percent U.S. bonds in simple index funds.
Now that everyone is using alternative investments, 
their long-term effectiveness must look a lot more like the broad stock market, except this stuff has to outperform by at least 2 percent per year just to stay even after fees! Our endowment supposedly has done very well recently; after all, it received a reward from the hedge fund industry in New York City.
I’d probably give them an award too, if they gave me so 
many millions. UF would be better served with a simple low-cost passive investment strategy that shuns the self-interested advice of Wall Street.

  In the past, the Anonymous collective has occasional-
ly used its powers for good. Users helped track down the girl who threw puppies in the river, and it’s aided 
in shutting down child pornography sites. But the group may now be harnessing its powers for an unworthy mis-sion.
  A couple of weeks ago, the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice and the FBI shut down the popular ﬁ  le-sharing site Megaupload, claiming the website violated copyright laws. A judge in New Zealand denied bail to Kim Dot-com, the website’s founder, about a week ago. Recently it was announced that as early as a couple of weeks from now, 50 million users could have their uploaded content permanently deleted.
  Shutting down Megaupload happened to take place 
the day after websites such as Google and Wikipedia blacked out in protest of SOPA and PIPA.
  So naturally, Anonymous “hacktivists” and large 
parts of the Internet community went nuts over it.
  Calm down. The cops most likely won’t burst into 
your house tomorrow, see the music you downloaded illegally and throw you in jail without due process.
  First, taking down Megaupload wasn’t the govern-
ment’s reaction to the blackout protests, as it could not have been a single-day operation. The U.S. Justice De-partment reported (without extensive media coverage) that the indictment was ﬁ  led on Jan. 5, weeks before the anti-SOPA blackouts.
  Second, Megaupload had it coming.  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act protects ﬁ  le-
sharing sites as long as they remove copyrighted mate-rial once someone ﬂ  ags it. YouTube, for example, has programs and staff  in place that almost immediately take down material ﬂ  agged as copyrighted. (I’m not say-ing you should try this, but if you upload a video with “Toxic” by Britney Spears playing in the background, in a short while you’ll get an email from YouTube telling you they’ve removed your content.)
  According to Reuters, prosecutors said Megaupload 
did not always remove ﬂ  agged copyrighted material.
  University of Oregon associate professor Reza Rejaie 
helped publish a study that looks closely at who uploads content onto ﬁ  le-sharing websites. He does not think these sites had low regulations by accident.
  “The person who established the website, on the one 
hand, is not to blame,” Rejaie said. “But think about it, how do they make money? What is interesting content? Copyrighted content. I think they have an incentive not to remove that material.”
  Government ofﬁ  cials said Megaupload cost owners 
of copyrighted material more than $500 million while making themselves more than $175 million. This money came partly from advertising but mostly from subscrip-tion fees.
  These accusations don’t in-
clude the claim that Megaupload executives were also involved in money laundering. Several Mega-
upload ofﬁ  cials have been personally charged with rack-eteering.
  So if Megaupload was involved in all of this, why 
did the Internet community react so strongly against the government taking it down? Because the website wasn’t all bad.
  You may have seen the (poorly edited and super 
awkward) video featuring various celebrities outwardly supporting Megaupload. These celebrities (Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Lil Jon and others) possibly spoke in favor of Megaupload partly because they were paid to. Let’s be real, Dotcom probably has so much money he’d be able to pay off my student loans with one check. But also, artists get a pretty bad cut from record companies. If they are able to switch over to a ﬁ  le-sharing site, they can cut out many of the middlemen and proﬁ  t more per song. And honestly, which great band ever wrote a song about how much they loved the music industry?
  Additionally, much of the material hosted on the site 
was legitimate.
  Michael Beardsworth, a computer and information 
science major at UO, said he believes the government is ﬁ  ghting a losing battle against these ﬁ  le-sharing sites.
  “Information wants to be free, and censorship to pro-
tect copyright is ultimately a failing strategy,” he said.
  Similarly, UO student Oliver Bochsler has conﬁ  dence 
that although the U.S. Justice Department shut down one large ﬁ  le-sharing site, it can’t prevent sites like it from hosting illegal material.
  “It’s good that they took the site down, but it’s a lot 
of effort to shut down something that’s going to have a similar replica back up and running soon,” Bochsler said.
  For those in opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act 
and the Protect IP Act, maybe this shutdown was a good thing. The U.S. Justice Department and the FBI have now shown Congress it doesn’t need to pass a poorly worded bill into law to take down websites that host copyrighted material.
  As we wait for the Megaupload game to play out, pay 
attention to the protests against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement that are happening all over Europe. The agreement was signed by the United States in Oc-tober 2011 — without Senate approval — and is awfully similar to the SOPA and PIPA bills the community fought so hard to push out of Congress a couple weeks ago.

  Two things I wish I’d known before coming to col-
lege: 1) Professors of liberal arts rarely provide worthwhile readings, and 2) The risk of clogging 
a friend’s toilet is never worth taking. The latter has an easy remedy: Never poop in a toilet of someone you know. The former leads me to engage in what I call academic warfare. 
  What is academic warfare, you ask? Well, it’s cre-
atively interpreting paper assignments in such a way that puts your professors in a quandary. Let me give you some examples of what I mean.
  My ﬁ  rst strategy for dealing with an irksome liberal 
arts professor is to include intense engineering discus-sions in my papers for that class. For instance, I was not a fan of my international relations class (mostly because of the clicker). As a ﬁ  nal assignment for the course, the professor required students to write a pa-per evaluating an anonymous argument on an inter-national issue. 
  I chose the one on climate change and described in 
detail how a crisis situation would lead all nations to pool their resources and design a rotating settlement in L5 orbit that has the means to construct a solar shield in L1 orbit — using Superadobe derived from lunar regolith — to reduce sunlight to the Earth by a mere .5 percent. (I also cited Captain Planet.)
  Another technique is to cite awkward sources and 
frame your argument in a manner that makes your professor uncomfortable. I previously took an English class on how viral videos circulate that was taught by a professor whom I greatly respect. Our ﬁ  rst big as-signment for class centered on a paper discussing the use and abuse of copyright for corporate purposes. 
  I generally believe the current state of copyright 
law gives copyright holders way too much control 
over culture to the point where it’s restricting speech. However, changing this has an unsavory implication: le-galizing for-proﬁ  t “toon” por-nography. Disney may want Jessica Rabbit depicted only as a lady in the parlor, but broadening fair use would bring out her inner whore on the street. So I framed my ar-
gument against corporate control of copyright in such a way that agreeing with it — by implication — re-quired the reader to consider the freedoms this would give to “toon” pornographers. 
  Even further, when writing papers, I try to make 
them as dense as the readings for the class. Not long ago, I received an email from a friend maligning a judge for using the words “withal,” “pellucid,” “as-severates,” “integument” and “lacunae” in his judi-cial opinion, reminding me of a reading I had for ﬁ  lm theory. 
  While my friend unfortunately was at the judge’s 
verbal mercy, I was lucky enough to have the professor at mine. I noted all the ridiculous syntax and diction in the article and used all the same sentence structures and words in my essay for the class. If a professor re-quires I wade through a pellucid swamp of academic obscurantism, I will make that professor do the same.
  When people hear of my antics, they’re typically 
shocked that I would be so ballsy. To that, I say, “En-gaging in academic warfare is only dangerous if you do not have a valid point to make and don’t know the material.” Weird looks usually follow that proclama-tion. 
  But if you know what you’re talking about, fram-
ing it creatively usually secures an even higher grade. On all the papers I mentioned earlier, I received an A. 
  So when a class bothers you, ﬁ  rst make your as-
signments ﬂ  awless, and then craft them in a way that bothers the professor. The power is yours.

Madison Kirby’s hands were full. Her 
son was hanging out with the wrong crowd,  
shooting heroin and heading down the same path as her lowlife ex-husband.
She was convinced she would find her son 
in a ditch, covered in urine. She raged at him and stormed off.
Exit stage right. The 20-year-old telecommunication and 
marketing junior fled to the wings of the Squitieri Studio Theatre in the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts as the next set of per -
formers replaced her.
The seventh annual Gainesville Improv 
Festival ended Saturday after four days of workshops, shows and an endless number of awkward situations.
The festival featured performances from 
improv groups across the country, including UF improv and sketch comedy group Theatre Strike Force. 
Improv consists of improvised comedy 
routines with no planning, costumes or set changes. The same actors could play multiple roles in one show.
TSF includes three long-form improv 
teams that string together a series of scenes in 30 minutes. The short-form improv team plays games similar to “Whose Line is it Any-way?”
The 40 to 50 members of TSF perform at 
four Gator Nights a semester and do shows for groups such as sororities and Florida Blue Key.
Ryan Phillips is a member of TSF’s short-
form group and the long-form Delta Group. The 20-year-old computer software engineer sophomore said he likes the laid-back nature of the teams.
“There’s no practice, there’s no home-
work,” he said. “If you’re in a sport you have to train, but in improv it’s as simple as show-ing up.”
Teachers from Chicago’s famed The Sec-
ond City improv and Improv Olympic The-ater groups taught workshops throughout the festival. They boast alumni such as Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert and Steve Carrell.Phillips said the teachers and improv 
teams from Chicago are in a different realm than TSF, but he thinks TSF does remarkably well for the time and resources it has.
“We’re trying to recreate what profes-
sional groups do in years in one semester,” Phillips said.
When Delta Group took the stage Thurs-
day night, its seven members rushed to the wings.
A son and a mother walked out and began arguing about the son’s new heroin habit and his drug-dealing friend Jimmy. The mother pointed out that her ex-husband’s friend named Jimmy also sold drugs. That’s when her son exploded.
“So what?” he exclaimed. “Can’t I have 
friends with that name?”
“It’s the same Jimmy,” his mother retorted. 
“He’s like 20 years older than you!”
Another player tapped the son on the 
shoulder, the actors switched and a new scene began. After a few unrelated scenes about awkward personalities, home-wreck-ing and gaydar, Jimmy surfaced as an actual character.
The boy’s mother confronted him about 
his drug dealing. They got into a heated de-bate, but they were replaced with another scene in about a minute.
Phillips said keeping up with the fast pace 
of the show can be difficult.
“The hard part isn’t coming up with a sto-
ryline in your head,” he said. “The hard part is coming up with a storyline with your play-ers. You don’t know what they’re thinking.”
The drug-addict son scenario popped up 
periodically until the last scene.
The players entered a sewer system and 
found Jimmy again, this time with the “sewer king” and mother-of-the-year’s terrified son. Jimmy leaned on the sewer king affection-ately and asked the son where his mom was. When the boy tearfully replied that he didn’t know, a booming voice replied and the boy’s mother entered the scene.
“I’m right here,” she yelled. “I don’t want 
to have to ID another pee body.” 
She paused. “I mean a body with pee on it, not the 
award.”8, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2012

During the first weekend of 
Black History Month, UF students 
gathered Saturday at Ustler Hall for a leadership conference.
The James E. Scott Black Student 
Leadership Conference encour -
aged students to help the African American population in the U.S. as a whole and hone their leadership skills. 
The all-day conference, put on 
by the Institute of Black Culture,  was open to students. Students listened to three featured speakers and attended three workshop ses-sions.
One of the speakers, education 
consultant and lecturer Brian Fa-vors, said after his speech that he wants to make students aware of issues that plague the black popu-lation, such as poverty rates and the number of black Americans in jail.
Nickelle Smith, a telecommuni-
cation sophomore, said this event was different than past leadership events she’s attended. 
“The message black students 
hear is usually to go to college and become successful,” she said. “It’s not to give back, which is what they said here.”Conference encourages giving back
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
FORT HOOD, Texas — A 
49-year-old brigadier general 
died Friday in Afghanistan of apparent natural causes, be-coming the highest-ranking U.S. soldier to die there, the military said Saturday.
Fort Hood announced Brig. 
Gen. Terence Hildner’s death in a statement posted on its website. Hildner had com-manded the 13th Expedition-ary Sustainment Command at Fort Hood since August 2010. He left for Afghanistan in De-cember to support the NATO mission there.
The Army said Hildner’s 
death was under investigation, although it appeared natural.
“This is a tragic loss for the 
Army, III Corps and for our Central Texas community,” Lt. Gen. Don Campbell Jr., Fort Hood’s commanding gen-eral, said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.”
The 13th ESC led by Hildner 
supports other units, handling the distribution of everything from clothing to ammunition and performing maintenance on equipment, according to its website.
Hildner served in Iraq dur -
ing both Operation Desert Storm and the 2003 U.S.-led war. He also served in Kuwait and was part of the last U.S. patrol along the East-West German border before its re-unification.
He assumed command of 
the 13th Corps Support Com-mand’s Special Troops Battal-ion at Fort Hood in 2003 and was in charge during two de-ployments, one in Iraq and one following Hurricane Katrina. In Iraq, the battalion provided general logistical support to units around Joint Base Balad and the Abu Ghraib prison complex. It provided military and humanitarian support after Katrina swamped New Orleans.
Hildner was born in New 
Haven, Conn., and listed Fair -
fax, Va., as his official home. He graduated from the Uni-versity of Notre Dame in 1984 and attended the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College in 1997. US Army: Brigadier

Lanita Bartley was the best player on the court in Florida’s tilt 
against Ole Miss.
She harassed the Rebels in the full-court press, grabbed re-
bounds among the big bodies in the paint and scored seemingly at 
will in the Gators’ 84-55 victory Sunday.
“We take pride in our defense and I think that’s real personal to 
[Bartley],” coach Amanda Butler said.
“We always have a chance to beat anyone we’re playing … be-
cause of the competitive spirit we have at the point guard position, and she’s certainly a giant part of that.”
Bartley led Florida with 17 points and a career-high 10 re-
bounds, recording her first ever double-double.
She also chipped in a team-best four assists and one steal.“I just like to crash,” Bartley said. “I just make sure my other 
guard is back and then I get to crash.”
While the senior guard dominated from a statistical standpoint, 
Bartley’s greatest contribution was her court presence, particularly in the transition game.
Bartley played 29 minutes Sunday and in that time, Florida 
dominated Ole Miss defensively. With Bartley on the court, the Gators outscored the Rebels 67-40 and forced 12 of the visiting squad’s 13 turnovers.
Conversely, Florida’s advantage shrunk to 17-15 sans Bartley.“She’s a fighter and plays with a chip on her shoulder,” Butler 
said. “That’s the only way that you can be five-foot-whatever and get 10 rebounds.”
While Bartley played her best game of the season, she was not 
the only senior to step up against Ole Miss.
Stewart turned in her best offensive performance of the year, 
putting up 14 points on 7-of-8 shooting.
Stewart’s effort marks her second consecutive game with dou-
ble-digit points and brings her average in the Gators’ last five con-tests to 9.2 points per game.

Kenny Boynton has not always 
been comfortable with clearing 
his mind and closing tight games for the Gators.
Despite his reputation as a 
high-volume shooter during his first two seasons at Florida, Boyn-ton found that forgetting one of his missed shots could be more complicated than simply taking another.  
“In the past years, my con-
fidence was messed up a lot,” Boynton said. “I was reading a lot (of what other people wrote about me) and I wasn’t used to not making shots.”
So when Boynton, a junior 
guard, saw his personal-best scoring pace begin to slow down three weeks into UF’s Southeast-ern Conference slate, he tried not to panic like he did earlier in his career. 
Against LSU on Jan. 21, his 
34-game 3-point streak ended, as did his overall national lead in made threes. Two games lat-er, when UF hosted Mississippi State, Boynton, again, went 0-for-3 from deep and scored a season-low two points.
Through 15 non-conference 
games, he averaged 19.5 points per game, but in his first six SEC games, Boynton’s scoring dipped to 11.7 points each outing.
“At some point in the season, 
everybody goes through about two or three games where their shot goes off,” Boynton said. “That was just my two- or three-game stretch. I don’t think there was ever a chance where I was worried about my shot.”
In Florida’s pair of wins against South Carolina and Van-derbilt, Boynton rebounded from his sub-par offensive performanc-es by scoring 42 combined points and matching his season average in back-to-back conference games for the first time this season.
Perhaps even more important was the way Boynton, and the rest of his team, finished each Gators’ victory.
Boynton scored a combined 
12 points on seven free throws, a layup and a 3-pointer in the final 1:09 against the Gamecocks and 1:01 against the Commodores.

son we’ve shown that we could

Two UF lacrosse players were involved 
in a scooter accident Friday afternoon.According to a team spokesman for 
the lacrosse program, Colby Rhea and 
Ashley Bruns were driving a scooter near The Estates apartment complex when they crashed into a car at the corner of South-west 34th Street and Southwest 20th Av-enue between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. 
According to a source close to the pro-
gram, Rhea suffered severe facial injuries that required stitches.The team spokesman 
said Bruns was not seri-ously hurt in the accident but did not know the ex-tent of Rhea’s injuries. 
A separate source 
close to the situation said that Rhea had to be taken from the scene in an am-
bulance. Rhea, a junior midfielder from Abing-
don, Md., appeared in 19 games for the Gators in 2011, scoring 15 goals and re-cording three assists.
Bruns, a junior attacker and native of 
Ellicott City, Md., was the Gators’ second-leading scorer with 46 goals and 28 as-sists.

Florida junior shortshop Nolan Fontana said he is working to be a mentor for younger 
players like freshman Casey Turgeon as the Gators search for a new second baseman.

 Nolan Fontana remembers being a 
freshman and searching for advice. 
Starting at shortstop in his ﬁ  rst year, the 
highly touted recruit from Winter Garden 
didn’t have to look far for answers. 
Positioned next to him was second base-
man Josh Adams, who gave Fontana what he called his most useful piece of knowl-edge.
  “Slow the game down,” Adams would 
tell Fontana. “From high school to col-lege baseball, it’s just a lot faster. If you let yourself get overwhelmed by it then it can hurt you.”
  The advice panned out. Fontana went 
on to be named to the Southeastern Con-ference All-Defensive Team his ﬁ  rst two years at UF. 
But now entering his junior season, 
Fontana ﬁ  nds himself without Adams for the ﬁ  rst time as a Gator. 
  While Adams prepares for minor league 
spring training for the Miami Marlins, Fontana will be adjusting to life with some fresh faces. 
  Now on his left could be freshman 
Casey Turgeon, a 22nd-round pick in the 2011 Major League Baseball ﬁ  rst-year draft, who UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said is ﬁ  -nally 100 percent after a scooter accident took him out of fall scrimmages. He will be battling with junior Cody Dent for playing time at second.
  “Whoever we play there has got some 
shoes to ﬁ  ll,” O’Sullivan said.
  Although he tries to not put too much 
early pressure on the freshman, O’Sullivan is conﬁ  dent in what he has seen from Tur-geon. Junior pitcher Hudson Randall said 
“there has been talk” about Turgeon get-ting the nod at second base. 
  “He’s a gamer, simple as that,” 
O’Sullivan said of the freshman. “I don’t want to put too much on his plate. I’m just a big Casey Turgeon fan, and I think he’s going to make an impact from day one.”
  Fontana knows there will be plenty of 
work to do when the Gators begin their season on Feb. 17 against Cal State Fuller-ton. 
As ﬂ  uid as his chemistry became with 
Adams, it only got that way through game action and repeated reps. 
  “Whoever ends up being over there, 
that’s what will happen,” Fontana said. 
  As the inﬁ  elders adjust to one anoth-
er, it will be Fontana’s job to be a leader and guide his neighbors the same way he watched Adams do for two years. 
  “Josh put me under his wing when I got 
here,” Fontana said. 
“That’s what I’m doing now with a cou-
ple guys. They’re all working real hard. It’s going to be hard to ﬁ  ll Josh’s shoes. He was a great ballplayer here, but I’m sure there are plenty of guys on this team that can do that.”
  For Florida, the questions will continue 
until the middle of the inﬁ  eld looks set-tled. Adams was Florida’s all-time leader in games played, and the experience of 253 trots out to second base is not easily replaced.   Fontana adjusting to life

shortstopBASEBALLbounce back when a team throws a punch at us,” 
Boynton said. “We closed the (Vandy) game out well. … I think we’ve been struggling earlier in the year with free throws but when it’s time to make free throws I think overall as a team we make them.”
Boynton went 13 of 15 from the free-throw 
line, including 5 for 5 against Vanderbilt, over the two games. 
In his six previous SEC games, he had made 
only 9 of 15 from the charity stripe.
Senior guard Erving Walker, who assisted on 
Boynton’s three in the final minute against Vandy, was also perfect from the line on four 
free throws. 
“So far in SEC, I think we’re a lot better,” 
Walker said. “Guys are just stepping to the line with confidence.”
Altogether against the Commodores, the 
Gators went 16 of 17 from the line after entering the game ranked 10th in the conference in free-throw shooting percentage.
“Even earlier in the year, we were shooting 
like 53 or 54 percent from the free-throw line,” coach Billy Donovan said. “It’s all focus and I do think some of this stuff with these guys is when they’re playing and they get fouled, they’re liv-ing in stuff that’s either happened in the past and their mind wanders.”

Florida point guard Lanita Bartley led the Gators with 17 points and 10 
rebounds in a 84-55 win against Ole Miss on Sunday. 
“I’m having great practices,” Stewart 
said. “(I‘m) just trying to be a threat all the 
time and posting hard. It sets up my next play.”
Stewart also grabbed seven rebounds, 
putting her third behind Bartley and red-shirt senior forward Ndidi Madu for the game.
Madu pulled down eight boards and 
scored eight points, coming just one basket short of three straight games with double-digit scoring.
She also matched her career-high with 
four assists, tying with Bartley for the team lead.
Led by Stewart and 
Madu, UF won the battle 
in the paint 36-26.
“We wanted [the post] 
to be our first line of at-tack,” Butler said. “Let’s go right at the block. Let’s make them stop us there.
A comfortable lead in 
the second half allowed Florida to give sig-nificant minutes to its bench.
Every Gator that suited up scored against 
the Rebels for the second consecutive game and the fifth time this season.
The player that took greatest advantage 
of her increased time was sophomore guard Brittany Shine.
She matched her season-high total of 14 
points on 5-of-7 shooting, boosted by a 67 percent clip from beyond the arc.
“Shine takes great pride in her offensive 
game and being such an instant offensive threat,” Butler said. “She really just plays with great confidence.”

� THE UF SOPHOMORE IS STILL 
RECOVERING FROM TWO SERI-OUS ANKLE INJURIES SHE SUF-FERED LAST SEPTEMBER.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
 
When Mackenzie Caquatto grace-
fully swung from the uneven bars and 
then nailed her dismount last Friday, her ankles looked great.
But the truth is her injuries are not 
100 percent healed just yet.
Caquatto, a sophomore, is slow-
ly returning back to top form after spraining and tearing ligaments in both of her ankles last September dur -
ing the final selection camp for the 2011 U.S. world team. 
“It’s day-to-day,” coach Rhonda 
Faehn said. 
“One day [the injury] feels pret-
ty good, the next day it’s not good. We’re hoping to just catch more of those good days than bad ones.”In her last two meets, Caquatto 
wrapped up two impressive perfor -
mances on bars. 
In UF’s quad win against top-
ranked Arkansas, No. 24 Maryland and Bridgeport, she recorded a 9.95 to win the bars title against a loaded field. 
Caquatto didn’t skip a beat in No. 
3 Florida’s 197.725-196.90 loss to de-fending national champion No. 6 Ala-bama last Friday. 
She scored a 9.9 to win her second 
consecutive bars title.
Her 9.9 tied for the highest indi-
vidual-event score the Gators tallied in Tuscaloosa, Ala., last Friday, as Caquatto was one of Florida’s bright spots that night.
“We started off strong on bars,” 
Faehn said. “I was really proud of [Caquatto] coming in with another bar title.” 
In Caquatto’s first season as a 
Gator, she averaged a 9.86 on bars, an event which is her specialty. 
She also competed two times as an all-around competitor and frequently took part in balance beam and vault lineups. 
According to Faehn, a return to 
beam for Caquatto will not happen for at least another month, although she started the beginning steps of a beam dismount during practice last Monday.
Faehn also said two weeks ago that 
Caquatto might return to the floor lineup by the end of the regular sea-son. 
“Initially, before season started, we 
had hoped that she would be ready for balance beam by [last Friday or this weekend],” Faehn said.  
“But realistically speaking, I would 
say about a month or so.” 
While the road back from ankle 
injuries has been a tumultuous one for Caquatto, her two bars titles this season signify progress in the face of adversity. 
“When you have severe ligament 
tears in both ankles, it’s worse than a break,” Faehn said. Caquatto wins second straight on bars
