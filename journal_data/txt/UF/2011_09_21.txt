  Surrounded by about 35 people, 27-year-old Lauren Han-
nahs joyfully announced “Happy repeal day!”
  Hannahs, the director of LGBT Affairs, organized Tuesday’s 
rally to celebrate the end of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” 
  The 18-year-old policy disqualiﬁ  ed gay people from serv-
ing in the military if their sexuality was discovered. Its repeal 
means openly gay and lesbian service members can serve.
  It also means UF’s 417 ROTC students can be open about 
their sexuality without fear of dismissal, said Lt. Col. Matt Hackathorn, public affairs ofﬁ  cer for U.S. Army Cadet Com-mand at Fort Knox, Ky.
  “I think this is a great day,” Hannahs said.  Hannahs organized Tuesday’s celebratory rally because 
the Service Members Legal Defense Network called and said it was organizing a collective repeal rally across the country at college campuses and non-proﬁ  t organizations.
  Four volunteers read stories of service members who had to 
keep their sexual orientations a secret and published letters that had been sent to the president, pleading for a repeal.   
  Eugene Hetley Jr., a 35-year-old cultural anthropology ju-
nior, shared his experience with the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy during his service as a Cavalry Scout.
  “Nobody cares what you do off-duty,” Hetley said. “All 
they want is for you to not engage in conduct that would reﬂ  ect badly on the unit.”
  More than 13,000 men and women were removed from the 
military under the ban, according to The New York Times.
  Hackathorn said he couldn’t say how many ROTC cadets 
had been dismissed because of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
  He added that it was legal for gay or lesbian students to 
be in ROTC as long as they didn’t announce they were gay or weren’t caught in an act of homosexuality.
  “We didn’t ask, and they didn’t tell,” he said.  Army cadets were required to take training sessions in the 
spring that discussed respecting one another, he said. The ses-sions were designed to prepare students for the repeal of the policy.
  “Our leadership says it’s time for it,” said Hackathorn.

  A majority of top business schools 
in the United States now allow ap-
plicants to submit GRE scores as an alternative to the GMAT, a survey by Kaplan Test Prep found.
  This is the ﬁ  rst time since Kaplan 
began tracking the issue in 2009 that a majority of the schools have ac-cepted the GRE, which traditionally has been used only for admission to non-MBA graduate programs, Rus-sell Schaffer, a spokesman for Ka-plan, wrote in an email.
  The survey was based on respons-
es from 265 of the top MBA programs in the United States, including 16 of the top 25 schools, Schaffer said. Fifty-two percent of the schools now accept GRE scores.
  ”The motivation behind business 
schools accepting the GRE, gener-ally, is to broaden the playing ﬁ  eld of who’s applying to programs,” said Andrew Mitchell, director of pre-business programs and GRE and GMAT instructor for Kaplan Test  Some business schools

  East Gainesville residents 
seeking medical care soon won’t have to travel far from their neighborhoods.
  Shands at UF broke 
ground Monday for the new UF&Shands Family Medicine at Main facility — a center that will replace Family Medicine at Fourth Avenue.
  The new two-story , 
24,200-square-foot center is set to open July 2012 at 1707 N Main St. 
  The original building on 
Fourth Avenue was built in 1976, right next to Alachua General Hospital.  Plans for a new building 
started about a decade ago as the old center was getting technologically outdated and had problems with plumbing, heating and air conditioning, said Dr. Whit Curry Jr., the chairman of the Department of Community Health and Family Medicine. 
  When AGH closed in 2009, 
this discussion process acceler-ated.   Curry said the new facility 
will be more centrally located for its patients who now must choose between visiting the Eastside Community Practice on Waldo Road or trekking to the west side of town to seek medical attention. 
  “The new building is right 
in the middle of where most of our patients come from,” Curry said. “The community really needed some kind of medical facility in that area.”
  With 24 exam rooms — ﬁ  ve 
more than at the current prac-tice — the number of annual patients seen at the new facility could reach up to 36,000, Curry said. 
  The increased space will also 
allow UF’s family medicine residency program to expand

� GAINESVILLE POLICE SAY THE INCIDENT 
OCCURRED NEAR MIDTOWN.
MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Staff Writer
A UF student reported being sexually battered 
to Gainesville Police early Tuesday morning. 
The student said she had been in the midtown 
area before the incident. 
She told police she was walking alone from 
that section of town and was near the 300 block of 
Northwest 18th Street when a man grabbed her from behind, restrained her with one arm and as-saulted her with his other hand, said Cpl. Angelina Valuri, GPD public information officer.
The 21-year-old student said the incident oc-
curred at about 1:40 a.m.
She was able to fight the man off and ran to her 
boyfriend’s house nearby . 
Officers responded to the report at about 2 a.m. The student told police the suspect was a white 
male who appeared to be in his 20s, according to Valori. He was approximately 5-foot-7 or 5-foot-8. She said the man weighed about 155 pounds and had dark hair. 
He was wearing a green polo shirt and khaki 
shorts when he attacked her, she said.
After a search of the area, GPD officers did not 
find the suspect, Valuri said.

When he tested out Student 
Government’s new electronic vot-
ing system Tuesday night, Senate President Micah Lewis chose the obvious candidate: Darth Vader.
The Sith Lord faced stiff com-
petition from members of the Star Wars Party and the Fantasy Party. 
Vader was unavailable to com-
ment on Lewis’ endorsement.
Lewis proposed the electronic 
voting system during the summer, and senators approved it  June 7. This is the first time UF will use this system. 
Student Body Treasurer T.J. 
Villamil estimated the switch will save SG about $25,000 per year. 
Students will be able to vote at 
10 on-campus locations during the SG elections on Sept. 27 and 28. Attendants will enter their UFID numbers, either by swiping their Gator 1 Cards or using other pho-to ID and manually entering the numbers.
Lewis said SG decided to re-strict voting to certain comput-ers for security and to make sure students don’t pressure other stu-dents into voting.
When a student’s information 
is entered, attendants will be able to see if that student voted previ-ously at another location on cam-pus, Reitz Union Systems Admin-istrator Steven Bourdon said. 
Students will then enter their 
GatorLink access information into computers, confirm their voting lo-cation districts and be taken to the voting screen for their districts.
The new voting method will 
also be more efficient than using paper rolls, said Acceleration.net Programming Director Ryan Da-vis. UF collaborated with Acceler -
ation.net for the voting program.
“It’s hard to keep big rolls of 
paper synchronized,” he said.  Davis said cross-checking results will be much easier with electronic voting.
There has been no word on 
whether attendants will use the Force to check results.4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 2011

� “TALK ISRAEL” WILL BE HELD AT 
20 CAMPUSES IN NORTH AMERICA.
AMANDA COHEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF Hillel and the UF Israel Network are 
participating in a nationwide initiative to 
promote discussion of Israel on the Plaza of the Americas from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. today.
The discussion, called “Talk Israel,” will 
be held on 20 campuses throughout North America, including UF, in an attempt to en-gage students in the dialogue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Sharon Ashley, director of the Center 
for Israel Engagement, said the event is not a rally but a chance to explore ideas and discuss events during this crucial moment in the Middle East. 
“Our goal is to emphasize the point 
that if we can’t have peaceful dialogue on campus, how can we expect our leaders to communicate,” said Joshua Kahn, the Jew-ish Agencies Israel program director at UF Hillel.
Palestine is seeking a unilateral decision 
from the United Nations this week instead of negotiating with Israel.
“We want to stress communication not only between the U.N. but also amongst students,” Kahn said. 
The discussion will take place in a tent, 
which will provide historical documents, statistics, maps and free Middle Eastern food. 
Following the event there will be free 
drinks and dinner at Farah’s on the Ave-nue, 1120 W University Ave., at 7:30 p.m. for a study abroad program information session. Representatives from four Israeli universities will be available to answer questions. Hillel, Israel Network to discuss Israeli-Palestinian conflict

The Obama administration is 
promoting a $447 billion bill that 
could help new graduates and oth-er Americans find jobs, but it may be difficult to pass in a sharply di-vided Congress.
Democratic National Commit-
tee Chairwoman Debbie Wasser-man Schultz and Associate Director of the Office of Public Engagement Kalpen Modi — better known as actor Kal Penn — spoke with col-lege journalists from around the country Monday during a confer -
ence call about the American Jobs Act, a piece of legislation that Obama unveiled this month. 
Modi said the bill would create 
jobs for young people and grow the economy. 
“This is very exciting,” he said. 
“We’re pushing really hard to make sure it gets passed.”
The bill would provide tax cuts 
of up to $4,000 for employers that hire people who have been unem-ployed for more than six months, 
according to the 
White House website. 
It would 
also support a Pathways Back to Work fund, which would help improve job opportunities for 
low-income youth and adults in part by supporting summer and year-round jobs for young people and local job training programs.
Erin Murphy, president of UF 
College Democrats, said the bill is what’s needed to jumpstart the American economy and put peo-ple back to work. 
Matt Pesek, second vice chair-
man for UF College Republicans, said that while the bill does include some Republican-supported ideas, such as providing tax cuts to small businesses, its price tag could pre-vent it from passing in Congress. 
An information sheet about the 
bill on the White House website said Obama would call on a joint committee to decide how best to reduce the deficit for the American Jobs Act.
Pesek said having the idea for 
the bill but not knowing how the country will pay for it is a prob-lem. 
“If we don’t know how to pay 
for something, we can’t do that then,” he said. “We can’t just keep inventing money like we have been.” Obama 
bill aims to create more jobs for grads

Crossing the Line
Animal rights group 
should stop harassment
If you have stepped on a cockroach recently, you might 
want to watch your back. 
A wacko animal rights organization called “Negotia-
tion is Over” has been targeting faculty, staff and students who work at the Sid Martin Biotechnology Incubator at UF.  
In a flier they distributed, the group offered a $100 re-
ward for any information on students involved in vivisec-tion (invasive experimentation on a living organism) at the research facility including “name of vivisection student,” a “picture of the student,” their “address, phone and any other contact info” and any information about animal ex-periments in which the student was involved.
On its website, the organization mentions that students 
involved in this sort of research will face “a lifetime of grief,” proceeding to mention car bombs, threats and inju-ries. On its website, there are diagrams on how to make an “Improvised Explosion Device” and a Molotov cocktail. 
Recently the group, led by Camille Marino, targeted an 
18-year-old Gainesville woman who it falsely claimed was a UF student conducting research at the facility. According to the Gainesville Sun, the woman has had no contact with animals and only cleaned a lab in the facility once. 
However, it would not have mattered whether this 
woman had been conducting vivisection or animal re-search; NIO has overstepped way too many lines. 
It has repeatedly invaded the privacy of innocent indi-
viduals and is threatening the safety of anyone involved at this research center. 
It appears that, for NIO, animal rights come before hu-
man dignity and human rights. 
The truth of the matter is that there is literally nothing 
we can do that does not have an adverse effect on some animal somewhere by virtue of our own existence. 
Given NIO’s perverted ideology, it would not stop at 
threatening animal researchers. When you arbitrarily award rights and protections to any living organism, you must include insects, bacteria and even viruses. 
It has no standard by which to judge whether anything 
deserves protection other than the fact that it is alive. 
Therefore, its logical end will be to fight anyone who 
kills insects in their home, any scientist that tries to cure a disease and eventually to promote the complete eradica-tion of the human race. 
Since when was there a separation of humanity and na-
ture? Eco-terrorists like NIO use language that places hu-mans outside of the realm of the environment and pay little attention to our own ecological needs. 
Whale Wars lunatic Paul Watson once called humans 
the “AIDS of the Earth.” 
When environmentalists look beyond “going green” for 
the sake of continuing the human race, and do so for the sake of the planet itself, total human extinction can be the only end.Journey of life makes for bumpy ride
Fender-benders eventually happen to all of us. One of 
my closest friends just had her first car accident.
Remember when you first started riding a bike 
and your dad let go? Remember what happened next? 
Over a year ago, my grandmother bought me my very 
first car. I was 18 going on 19. 
Within about a three-to-four-month window, I had 
four incidents involving my car, all of them linked to one another. 
The car was a Datsun from 1981. It bore a garnet color, 
which dishonored my country, the Gator Nation. Fortu-nately, euphoria blocked any sense of treason. 
I felt freedom at my fingertips. I sat in it for a couple of 
hours. I did not move a muscle.
The tin can hummed as if it were a bumblebee gliding 
across the pavement like butter on a skillet. I loved that car. 
She was an antique, so power steering had not been 
incorporated into the manufacturing of my burgundy dream. 
She handled very similarly to tugging your younger 
brother on a rusty long board. As it turns out, trying to haul a 160-pound teenager is far from the greatest idea conceived by living man. My brother, Forrest, has the scars to prove it.
My car was not nearly as lucky. One cool night in April, my other younger brother, 
Noah, called me to pick him up from somewhere. I cannot remember the place. 
Frustration swept over. Who really likes running er-
rands? 
On the way to pick him up, the tire popped. I nicked 
the curb. It sucked. Guilt washed over me, but I remember thinking that everyone screws up and makes mistakes. I do not like the baggage  that comes with mistakes, so I cast the incident aside. 
My step-grandfather put a new tire on the beaten 
clunker. 
I do not know how well he screwed it on because driv-ing home one night, coming from a friend’s house, the same tire decided to roll on ahead without me. 
Sparks flew. I jerked her. We 
skidded off the road. I was in the middle of an action movie dur-ing a crash scene, without the glamor of Hollywood, of course.  
A flying wheel can really take 
the wind out of your sails, and my girl was out of commis-sion for a few weeks. 
On graduation day, she came back to me, still huffing 
and puffing. What happened next probably sums up how the rest of our lives are going to turn out.
I was late. I rushed to graduation practice but found 
myself lost. Taking a turn that led to back roads, I clicked on my iPhone to show me the way. Now, however, my hands were not where they should have been. 
The next moment, my car tried to perform a do-it-your-
self facelift with a telephone pole. I really don’t think she thought that one through. 
Talk about raining on my parade.The situation burdened me. It pressed my mind. It took 
all the excitement and joy out of me.
I felt like the world was ending, but guess what? I grad-
uated. 
Life does not stay in the ditch forever. You have to pull 
her out. You have to bang out all the dents before  you can move down the road.
Society works diligently in search of the magic bullet to 
cure all of our ailments. Life does not work without you putting forth the effort to care for it. There is a long dusty highway out in front of us with an infinite amount of exits leading anywhere. 
That 1981 Datsun drove me all the way to college. Well, almost.  Nicholas Butler is a journalism sophomore at UF. His col-
umn appears on Wednesdays.

Letters to the Editor
Alligator seeks to please administration
On Friday, Tigert Hall was alive with 
activism. Students marched through the 
doors and demanded to meet with UF President Bernie Machen about the recent 15 percent tuition hikes. Machen agreed to meet with several organizers from Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) later this week, where we intend to lay out our argu-ments for affordable tuition.
That’s why we were disturbed by the 
editorial in yesterday’s Alligator, which condemned SDS for organizing students and ridiculed the entire idea of resisting tu-ition hikes.
We are always amazed at the handful of 
cynics who point out that Florida universi-ties are among the most affordable in the country, as if that’s a bad thing.
The affordability of outstanding public 
universities, like UF, is the reason that stu-dents of any economic background can re-ceive a college education and hope to com-pete in the ever-worsening job market.
Our campaign against tuition hikes isn’t 
about finding something to protest. It’s about making sure that cost never prevents the best and brightest in Florida from join-ing the Gator Nation.
It’s alarming to hear from our student-
run newspaper that we have no right to be here at UF. At one time lawmakers told women, African-Americans, Latinos and others that they had no right to attend pub-lic universities.
Last Friday, SDS proclaimed on the steps 
of Tigert Hall that poor and working stu-dents have the same right to be Gators as wealthy students. Future Gators will decide whether we were right to fight for afford-able education, not the opinion of the Al-ligator’s opinions editor, a political commu-nication graduate student, seeking to please the administration.
We all grew up thinking that if we 
worked hard in school and stayed out of trouble, we could get a quality education in Florida without breaking the bank. Times have changed. 
Since Bright Futures switched to dis-
pensing scholarship money at a flat rate instead of by percentage, the top award only covers 53.5 percent of tuition cost, and FMS awards — formerly “75 percent Bright Futures” — covers just over 40 percent of tuition cost.
Students aren’t invited to the meetings 
where the administration makes important decisions about our ability to attend college — we must demand such meetings, and SDS uses rallies to achieve those demands.
Yesterday’s editorial had one thing right: We all need to tighten our belts during this economic crisis.
Student tuition has increased by 15 per -
cent every year since 2009. Bright Futures barely affects our final tuition bill, and Pell Grants are drying up with every compro-mise brokered in Washington. More stu-dents than ever before are picking up full-time jobs just to stay in school and pay rent. Our belts can’t get any tighter. 
On the other hand, how is administra-
tion tightening its belt? Why is there no talk of pay cuts for UF President Bernie Machen, whose $415,000 salary is bolstered by an-nual $285,000 bonuses? Next year, Machen is scheduled to receive an extra $400,000 “long-term performance bonus.” Why are students wrong to call that unacceptable? 
Why can’t we tap into the $1.5 billion en-
dowment — the largest of any university, public or private, in the state of Florida — to make up for the budget shortfall? 
Here’s a question: Why did UF drop five 
notches in the 2011 U.S. News & World Re-port college rankings to 58 — down from 47 in 2009 — despite our tuition increasing 15 percent every year, ostensibly to improve the quality of our education? Maybe the real problem is the administration’s poor management of the tuition we already pay, like spending $35,000 on statues around campus.
Let’s force the administration to answer 
these questions before they hike our tuition 15 percent every year until 2019.
Yesterday’s editorial asked if UF should 
be allowed to determine its own standards for entry and payment. Both SDS and the Editorial Board agree, but we have different conceptions of who makes UF what it is. 
For some, UF is the Board of Trustees, 
the wealthy alumni, and the president that these powerful groups selected to oversee the university. 
For SDS and our allies, UF is the Spanish 
junior renting a canoe with friends by Lake Wauburg. UF is the pre-med student drink-ing coffee to stay awake in Library West for their orgo midterm. UF is the active student organizations that make campus vibrant, like the Black Student Union, Islam on Campus and Gator Robotics. And UF is the student who works 40 hours a week to pay tuition and still manages to hold down a 3.8 GPA.
All SDS wants is for these people — the 
real UF — to have a say when it comes to tuition.

Roger Sliney, 25-year-old chemistry ju-
nior, worked as an Army intensive-care unit 
nurse for five years and spent 15 months in Iraq.
He said the people he met while on duty 
were among the first to completely accept him for being gay.
“We had rifles and were on guard duty 
together,” Sliney said. “They didn’t care.”
Both Sliney and Hetley said it wasn’t 
common for military personnel to be dis-charged under the policy . But in one extreme case Sliney witnessed, the service members were asked to donate blood, and one of the drill sergeants took an openly gay service member out of the line.
A study released in 2009 done in part by 
UF associate professor of psychology Bonnie Moradi suggested that military discipline was not affected when a unit’s members knew that one of their fellow service mem-bers was gay . 
“The culture of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ has 
gone away,” Hannahs said. “Now, the law has caught up with how people are living and treating each other.”

The UF&Shands Family Medicine at Main facility will be 24,200 square feet and will open in July 2012.Facility will be staffed 
by residents, physicians
from 24 students to 30, which Cur -
ry said could directly benefit the 
Gainesville community.
Of the 247 graduates of the 
family medicine program, 72 have stayed in Gainesville to practice.
“If you go see a family physi-
cian, the chances that they came from our program are pretty high,” Curry said.
Family physicians are trained 
in a variety of specialties so they will be able to see and treat pa-tients of all ages and all medical conditions.
In addition to the residents, 
the facility on Main Street will be staffed by 10 physicians from UF’s College of Medicine as well as fac-ulty members who specialize in orthopedics and sports medicine, dermatology, prenatal care and so-cial services.
“You can come to this new 
practice, and 90 percent of the time, we’ll be able to take care of whatever the problem is right then and there,” Curry said.SHANDS , from page 1
RAlly , from page 1Veterans shared their experiencesUF still requires GMAT scores
Prep.
Mitchell said it’s a common pattern 
for students who don’t consider business 
school during their undergraduate years to end up there a few years later. For some-one who is thinking of pursuing a master’s degree but who isn’t sure about his or her particular course of study, the GRE now is a more flexible option.
Kathy Harper, director of marketing 
and recruiting for Working Professional MBA Admissions, said everyone who ap-plies to UF’s traditional full-time MBA program still must submit a GMAT score.
Harper said applicants to the part-time 
working professional MBA program could submit a GRE score instead of a GMAT score only if they have completed a medi-cal doctor degree, a doctor of pharmacy degree, a doctorate degree or a master’s degree for which the applicant took the GRE in the last five years. This option has been in effect for the last two admission cycles.
“We are not at the point where we’ll do 
a flat-out GRE admission [for undergradu-ate applicants],” Harper said.BUSINESS , from page 1 “We are not at the point where 
we’ll do a flat-out GRE admission 
[for undergraduate applicants].”

Harrison improving: Center 
Jonotthan Harrison had his best 
game against Tennessee, accord-ing to Weis and coach Will Mus-champ.
On Monday , Muschamp gave 
Harrison his weekly Scrap Iron Award, which goes to the team’s best offensive lineman.
“He was very , very good,” 
Weis said. “If he can play with that physicality that he played with (against Tennessee) against a good team … that bodes well for our strength up the middle.”
Elam case closed: Safety Matt 
Elam settled his July charge for underage possession of alcohol on Monday . Elam pleaded no contest and agreed to pay $291 in court fees. He will also complete 12 hours of community service and pay a one-time fee of $40 for six months of supervised probation, according to the Associated Press.
Elam was arrested in late July 
after an officer stopped him for carrying an open container that was found to have had Hennessy cognac and cola in it. It was Elam’s second arrest for underage alco-hol possession since enrolling at Florida.
Contact Tom Green at tgreen@
alligator.org.to get more production out of 
Powell. 
“I knew I had to do more and 
it was something that I felt already myself,” Powell said. “They just addressed it.”
Powell responded with half a 
sack and two quarterback hurries against Tennessee, both of which resulted in interceptions. 
He also added a pair of tackles 
and was a consistent force for the defense. 
“I just had a good week of 
preparation and a good week of practice and a lot of film,” Powell said. “Coach Quinn, we sat down and he showed a lot of examples on how he wanted (me to play). I just took it from there and played the way I could play.”
Through Florida’s first two 
games, Powell struggled to adjust to the intricacies of his new Buck linebacker position.  
As the Buck, Powell is required 
to rush the passer, play the run and drop into coverage, depend-ing on the call. It’s a lot to learn for a young player, leading to Powell thinking too much on the field rather than playing a fast, reac-tionary style. 
Last week, Quinn said Powell was starting to understand the position and his results would fol-low. Evidently , Quinn was right. 
“It was just taking it from the classroom to the field and going without thinking,” Powell said.

After Will Muschamp and Dan Quinn said they wanted to see more production from Ronald Powell, 
the sophomore stepped up against Tennessee, contributing half a sack and forcing two picks. 
Sophomore gets pressure, forces two interceptions
FOOTBALL , from page 16
NOTEBOOK , from page 16Elam pleads 
no contest to July alcohol charge
gives you. Let’s get Muschamp’s take.
“Within Charlie’s system, we evaluate our 
talent and decide what we can do,” he said 
after Rainey ran around, over and past every-
thing in that other shade of orange Saturday.
Subtle but telling, Boomer. Not to read too 
much into one quote, but Muschamp is basi-cally admitting that Florida’s best option is not to pass the ball to the wide receivers. And who could blame him? 
Thompson has been the definition of lack-
luster throughout his time here. Quinton Dunbar is raw, still in his first real season playing at the collegiate level. Andre De-bose is definitely not the next Percy Harvin. Frankie Hammond? Does he even have a catch this year? 
They are not the weapons on offense; they 
are decoys. They are not downfield threats, except, of course, when they’re blocking for Rainey and Demps.
Asked if he was content with receivers 
catching just three passes in the win against Tennessee, Muschamp cemented the mes-sage.
“Yeah,” he said bluntly. “We’ll line 
up and run the wishbone if we can win. “It’s all about winning to me. When I first was a coordinator, I’d run and grab these stat sheets right when I come off the field. ... As I won as a coordinator I started to figure it out. It’s about winning. Do what you’ve got to do to win the game.” 
“It’s hard for me to sit there and not put 
the ball in Jeff Demps’, Chris Rainey’s and Trey Burton’s hands at this point.”
Because UAB and FAU didn’t defend 
the flats and Rainey dismembered Tennes-see doesn’t mean the Gators took what the defense gave them. They took what they wanted.

  Following each of Florida’s nine 
non-conference games, a video had 
to be posted online to keep other teams around the Southeastern Conference informed on the Gators’ play . 
  When UF’s conference rivals 
eventually tuned in to the feed, they likely expected to see midﬁ  elder McKenzie Barney and forward Tah-nai Annis pick up where they left off last season as the No. 6 Gators’ (7-2) leading scorers. 
  Instead, other teams witnessed 
Florida’s established stars miss huge chunks of the game and a steady stream of freshmen picking up the slack with a combined eight goals and nine assists.
  “There’s nothing better than a 
diverse goal-scoring group,” Barney said. “You can’t ask for more from a team. We’d like for those goals to be a lot more, but the fact that we’re getting them from different people game in and game out is awesome.”
  Despite coming off a career sea-
son  in which she scored an SEC-best 14 goals, Barney has been on the ﬁ  eld for just 43.66 minutes per game — the fewest in her two healthy sea-sons with the Gators after an ACL tear sidelined her in 2008.
  As a redshirt freshman, she 
played almost six minutes more per contest, and that built up to last season, when she started all but two games and saw 70.88 minutes per match.
  With Florida nearly at the mid-
way point of the 2011 campaign, Barney’s sharp decline in playing time has also hurt her production on the ﬁ  eld. The midﬁ  elder has only found the back netting twice thus far.
  “Last year was last year,” she said. 
“This is a better scenario to be in, be-cause if you’re not on, then someone else is going to be on. That’s team dynamics and that’s what is going to make us successful.”
  Barney isn’t alone in battling for 
playing time with freshmen like midﬁ  elders Annie Speese (three goals, four assists) and Havana So-laun (two goals, two assists) and forward Tessa Andujar (two goals, one assist).
  Annis, a senior and second-team 
All-SEC selection with 13 goals last year, is playing 26 fewer minutes per game this season and has scored three times. Even the team leader in goals, junior midﬁ  elder Erika Tym-rak, is seeing less time. The 75-plus minutes she played last year has dropped to 66.33 this season.
  “When the focus can be taken 
off [Tymrak] and maybe spread around to a few others, that’s good for us,” assistant coach Alan Kirkup said. “We expect Tahnai and Mack to score or create chances for us. I mean, I don’t think that’s an issue, the fact that other people can step up and do those things too is a bo-nus for us.”
  In 2010, opposing defenses knew 
where the Gators’ scoring was com-ing from as Annis and Barney ac-counted for 48 percent of the team’s goals. This season, the attack has a far more balanced approach with the pair responsible for just 19 per-cent.
  Over an eight-day span stretching 
back to last week, Florida downed Florida Gulf Coast, Missouri and Kansas by a combined score of 14-2, and received goals from nine differ-ent players, leading Annis to believe the midﬁ  elders and forwards are ﬁ  -nally starting to jell in the offensive rotation.
  Along with Barney’s goal against 
the Jayhawks, Annis played her most impressive game of the season with two goals in only 49 minutes.
  “Our offense is ﬁ  nally coming 
together more than it has,” she said. “We’re starting to ﬁ  nd more connec-tions and combinations up front that have really helped our offensive ex-plosion.”

A former UF track and field athlete ac-
cused of sexually assaulting a woman in June 
has moved one step closer to resolving his case after the State Attorney’s Office filed for -
mal charges against him last week.
Dumisane Hlaselo, a South African native, 
was charged with sexual battery on an inca-pacitated victim — a first-degree felony — on Sept. 15 by the 8th Circuit State Attorney’s Of-fice and prosecutor Deborah Hunt following more than three months of investigation.
The 22-year-old’s defense attorney, Hunt-
ley Johnson Jr., confirmed that a first-degree felony is the lone charge at this point. Johnson is hoping to have the case resolved within the next 60 days.
Hlaselo, who also raced cross country as 
a junior for the Gators following his transfer from the University of the Free State in South Africa, has been held in the Alachua County Jail since his arrest on June 28 for an incident that occurred 16 days earlier.  
According to a Gainesville Police Depart-
ment report, in the early morning hours of June 12, Hlaselo entered his roommate’s bedroom at 7 SW 23rd St., and had sex with a semi-conscious woman without her permis-sion.
Under the state of Florida’s sexual battery 
statutes, Hlaselo’s charge is described as happening, “When the offender, with-out the prior knowledge or consent of the victim, ad-ministers or has knowledge of someone else administer -
ing to the victim any nar -
cotic, anesthetic, or other intoxicating substance 
which mentally or physically incapacitates the victim.”
According to the GPD report, after initially denying having sexual contact with the wom-an when interviewed on the day of the inci-dent, Hlaselo later confessed to having non-consensual sex with her when questioned again by police. 
The 5-foot-7, 125-pound distance runner 
was arrested. He was immediately dismissed from the UF track and field program.
In his 10 months of competition on both the 
men’s cross country and track teams, Hlaselo racked up four individual victories, including the 2011 Southeastern Conference Champion-ship in the 3,000-meter run, and became the first athlete in school history to run a sub-four minute mile.

Florida may be 3-0 and off to a 
fast start in the Southeastern Con-
ference, but offensive coordinator Charlie Weis is not pleased with Florida’s progress on offense.
“I’m pretty disappointed,” 
Weis said. “Anyone who really is meticulous in their preparation at this stage of the season finds a lot of faults. ... We can get a lot better on offense.”
Through three games, Florida 
ranks 28th in the nation in scoring offense (37.7 points per game), and 31st in total offense (442.33 yards per contest).  While Weis is pleased that the offense is moving the ball effectively, he rattled off a laundry list of areas that need im-provement moving forward.
Among the things that irked 
Weis following the Tennessee game were Florida’s third-down conversion percentage, Jeff Demps’ fumble in the third quar -
ter, the Gators’ inability to run down the clock in the final min-utes, mental errors and the nine penalties on offense — including three false starts. 
“Trust me,” Weis said. “There 
are plenty of things for me to be miserable about.”
The Gators’ lack of production 
at wide receiver, however, is not a concern. John Brantley has only 17 completions to receivers, with the majority of his passes coming in the underneath game to run-ning backs.
But Weis believes his receiv-
ing corps will be able to step up if teams take away the flats.
“That wouldn’t be a prob-lem,” Weis said. “There will be games that come up that way , but for now you just got to take it one game at a time.”
Rainey, Demps take limited 
contact in practice: Running back Chris Rainey has been nearly un-touchable on the field this season — and that apparently extends to the practice one, too. 
Weis said the coaches limit 
contact on Rainey and fellow speedster Jeff Demps in practices to keep the duo fresh for Satur -days.
The move has paid off, as 
Rainey is averaging 173.33 yards from scrimmage while Demps has also shouldered a significant load on offense.

At the snap of the ball, sophomore 
linebacker Ronald Powell fires out of 
his three-point stance. 
After a quick stutter step, he easily 
sneaks past the right tackle’s inside shoulder and blows by a running back’s attempt to help. 
Tennessee quarterback Tyler Bray 
notices and rolls out to his right as Powell pursues. With UF’s linebacker closing in, Bray lets go of an under -
thrown pass that becomes the first interception of Florida’s season and turns the tide of the Gators’ eventual 33-23 win. 
Powell doesn’t get more than a 
quarterback hurry on the stat sheet, but it was his play that made the dif-ference. And not just on this down, but throughout what coach Will Mus-champ called Powell’s most impres-sive game of the season. 
“He played well,” Muschamp said. 
“Played his best game in the first three and got some really good pressure. …  More than anything, he played fast, played physical, and that’s what we needed out of him. Certainly had it in him, and we’ve just got to do a better job of coaching.”
Powell’s strong performance was 
a departure from Florida’s first two games, when he recorded a sack but did not consistently affect opposing quarterbacks. 
His struggles drew the ire of Mus-
champ and defensive coordinator Dan Quinn, who both cited the need Powell

UF taking what defense allows? Not a chance
It started against Florida Atlantic in the 
opener, carried over into the UAB game, and came to a head after beating Tennes-
see.
Everyone wants to know if the Gators 
can beat a team deep — through the air, in-stead of in the hands of Chris Rainey.
So much has been made of John Brant-
ley’s numbers — receivers have hauled in just 17 of his 47 completions — that he and Will Muschamp are constantly inundated with questions about the downfield passing attack, or lack thereof. 
The response is always the same, quickly 
becoming predictable: Take what the de-fense gives you.
Deonte Thomp-
son was asked last week if he wants opponents to fill the box, bringing a safe-ty out of coverage in an effort to stop the run. As a receiver, it 
would open things up downfield, allowing Thompson a chance to make an impact and pad the stat sheet. His response?
“Nah, I mean if they’re going to give it to 
us easy, we’re going to take it,” Thompson said. “We’re trying to get this champion-ship, man.”
In reality, the Gators are doing what they 
want: punishing opponents with some of the most dynamic players in the country. 
Rainey, and to a lesser extent, Jeff Demps 
and Trey Burton, are the strengths of this team. They want to use them as much as they can. And why not? 
They’re significantly better options than 
anything Florida has to offer outside the hashes. 
But still, time after time, somehow we go 
back to that phrase — take what the defense See no Te, p Age 13
