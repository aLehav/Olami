How did you spend your week? And what 
were you doing when the heavens opened 
Saturday evening over Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-
dium?
If you were in your warm, cozy abode, 
there are some students that are disappointed 
in you — a hardy sort that stayed through the 
delays, through the rain that felt like bullets, 
through the rain that came down sideways in sheets cascading over and over and over again upon waterlogged patrons in the Swamp. 
It was the biblical kind, the kind that 
makes you think the school should have in-deed invoked the “act of God” clause in the game contract with Idaho. 
That clause states that anything from a 
hurricane to an insurrection can be used as an excuse to cancel a sporting event without monetary obligation to its visitors. An argu-ment can be made that Saturday’s weather toed that line.
And so began the weird, pseudo-opening 
week, from Saturday until today, the ﬁ  rst six strange days of the 2014 Florida football sea-son.
■   ■   ■
Andrew Scattizi, a 24-year-old junior at 
UF, spent his Saturday evening in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. 
He stayed chilled and soaked in the north 
end zone and watched while students brought pizzas to two policemen standing out in the deluge. 
There was a gator chomp in return from 
the boys in blue “that was pretty awesome,” he said.
Then the band played under the cover, 
as hundreds of people packed like sardines 
swung and swayed to “We are the Boys.”
Danny Gibble started the “week of weird” 
running. 
He left the stadium after the game was sus-
pended the ﬁ  rst time to go home and eat some 
instant noodles. He heard the game was back on, and sprinted back two-and-a-half miles to the stadium just in time to miss what would be the game’s only play. 
It turned out to be an “unfortunately comi-
cal night” after he waited for a game that was never resumed, all in good fun in support of the Gators.
Matt Stewart thought he would only be 
hoisting the ﬁ  eld goal net Saturday night be-fore the rains came down. 
Then after a directive from his boss, the 
University Athletic Association operations 
intern became part-time security guard with 
strict orders not to let anyone onto the ﬁ  eld.
In part, Stewart and the rest of the people tasked with that responsibility failed, and he 
admitted it was humorous when the ﬁ  rst of 
four girls to rush Florida Field hit the turf — he didn’t even realize it until she got to about midﬁ  eld.
“Then the next three came at about the 
same time, and they just gave themselves up to us,” Stewart said. “I’m just thinking, why would you come onto the ﬁ  eld if you’re not going to showboat a little bit?”
The group of three that ran onto the ﬁ  eld 
declined to comment to alligatorSports about the situation; the fourth could not be reached for comment. 
AlligatorSports has conﬁ  rmed that neither 
the Alachua County Sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce nor the Gainesville Police Department arrested any of the women. The University Police Department conﬁ  rmed that they did not arrest the women 
but did take them into custody and ejected 
them from the stadium Saturday night.
■   ■   ■
Demarcus Robinson, Darious Cummings 
and Jay-nard Bostwick began the week sus-
pended — Cummings and Bostwick for the 
ﬁ  rst time and Robinson for the fourth game out of 13 possible in his college career. 
For Cummings and Bostwick, it was a vio-
lation of team rules. For Robinson, a campus sanction.
Three hours before the game Saturday, all 
three were in the doghouse. But by Monday morning, they were free men with suspen-
sions lifted, ready to take the ﬁ  eld.
That decision has caused coach Will Mus-
champ to spend part of the week on the de-
fensive after coming under ﬁ  re in the court of 
public opinion.
ESPN’s Michael Wilbon called the lifting 
of the suspensions “unbelievably intellectu-
ally and sort of morally lazy,” on “Pardon The Interruption.” Denver Post columnist Woody 
Paige referred to it as “the biggest, lamest, 
thing I’ve ever heard,” on ESPN’s “Around The Horn.”
On Wednesday, Muschamp spent a portion 
of the Southeastern Conference teleconference ﬁ  ring back at detractors with an impassioned defense of his disciplinary practices.
“It’s very frustrating for me as a coach or 
any coach to have someone being critical and 
you don’t even have all the information,” he 
said. “So at the end of the day I make the deci-sions in this program I handle the discipline in this program and it’s been handled very 
well.’’
He reiterated that his approach to player 
discipline is about more than just suspending 
player. It’s a wholesale correction of behav-ior.
■   ■   ■
Tight end Jake McGee spent this week with 
the same mindset he’s had since the begin-ning of August. With no game the previous 
week, the redshirt senior transfer said it felt 
like another week of camp.
“It feels like camp has just kept going,” 
McGee said. “Feels like you’re in a ﬁ  ve-six week camp now and you want to sort of get 
to the reward of a game. So it’s something that 
guys will keep practicing hard this week but everybody in the locker room wants and is anxious for a game.”
McGee’s strange start to the week had 
nothing to do with the weather. He watched the Virginia Cavaliers play a football game on TV instead of on the sidelines for the ﬁ  rst time since 2010. McGee transferred to UF in the 
summer after four years at UVA, including 
last season when he was the Cavaliers’ most reliable receiving target.
Other players spent this week angry. Buck linebacker Dante Fowler tweeted “Never felt 
this rage before,” after the game was initially 
terminated. 
Linebacker Mike Taylor needs an outlet 
for his frustration. The only problem is, he has to wait — patience, something everyone 
involved with the Florida football team has 
learned to have a lot of after Saturday.
“Out at practice (Tuesday) I got mad,” 
Taylor said. “Because I’m like, ‘Dang, I can’t 
take anyone to the ground.’ You don’t want 
to unleash on your teammates, so it’s just like when I ﬁ  nally get out there, pray for (Eastern Michigan). That’s how we all feel, because we’ve got some stuff to let out. It’s been a 
while, so we’re just ready to take the ﬁ  eld.”

Athletics director Jeremy Foley announced 
that Florida would not be making up the Ida-ho game on Wednesday afternoon. The Van-
dals will receive their full contracted $975,000 and are guaranteed a game down the road in 2017. Tickets will be refunded to most fans and both parties close the book on an unnatu-
ral situation. Now, ﬁ  nally the full focus can 
shift.
Eastern Michigan — a team that gave up 
the sixth-most total yards in the FBS last sea-
son — will serve as the sacriﬁ  cial lamb just 
like it did after a 2004 game against UF was postponed due to weather.
The Gators are caged animals ready to 
strike in all kinds of weather after a week 
that can only be described as downright ab-
normal. They will bring their own brand of thunder, not from the sky or even the AC/DC version that blares through the loudspeakers 
before kickoff.
Whatever happens Saturday, one thing is 
certain — you can blame it on the rain.

An attempted murder suspect with an 
outstanding warrant for repeatedly stab-
bing someone was found and arrested Thursday in Newberry. 
Travis Jermal West, 26, was located and 
then arrested at a Newberry mobile home by the U.S. Marshals Florida Regional Fu-gitive Task Force, according to a press re-lease. The warrant for West’s arrest was is-sued after police said he stabbed and took money from a victim on July 31 near the 200 block of Southwest Sixth Avenue in downtown Gainesville. 
The victim told Gainesville Police that 
he was in the area to buy bootleg cigarettes, according to the release. 
The task force that arrested West is 
composed of U.S. Marshals, detectives and investigators from local agencies, includ-ing GPD and the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce. The task force typically focuses on violent fugi-tives, according to Deputy 
U.S. Marshal Bryon Car-
roll. For this case, Carroll 
said they combined their talents to ﬁ  nd West in a group effort. 
Task force members received informa-tion this week that West, who is known to ofﬁ  cers as being violent, ﬂ  ed to Newberry in an attempt to hide from law enforce-ment following the incident. Carroll said as the information on West’s whereabouts 
developed, their attention shifted from 
Gainesville to Newberry. 
Through the department’s investiga-
tions, task force members found West was staying at a mobile home located at 25309 VOLUME 109 ISSUE 9 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2014

The famous rallying call of George Edmond-
son, better known as Mr. Two-Bits, will ﬁ  nd 
new life Saturday when the Gators face Eastern Michigan.
“Two bits, four bits, six bits, a dollar. All 
for the Gators, stand up and holler,” will ring through the stadium once again with a new voice.
The UAA has selected 21-year-old UF busi-
ness administration senior Joshua Comiter to serve as the ﬁ  rst student honorary Mr. Two-Bits, reprising Edmondson’s traditional role for the pregame in The Swamp.Edmondson said even though the Gators 
had a rough start this season with the rain, bringing back the Two-Bits tradition will ener-gize fans.
“It’s a great idea, as long as they can keep up 
the enthusiasm,” he said.
Comiter was selected for the role after his

City commissioners were dismissive 
about a proposed mandatory bicycle 
registration program during the commis-sion’s bimonthly meeting Thursday.
“According to UPD, theft is the No. 1 
crime problem at the University of Flor-ida, and bicycles are the No. 1 target,” said Yvonne Hinson-Rawls, District 1 city commissioner.
Both Gainesville Police and University 
Police already have free voluntary bicycle registration programs, but a mandatory program could help law enforcement ﬁ  nd stolen bicycles more effectively.
“It could really help us deter what’s 
happening and lower our crime rates,” said Sgt. Jaime Kurnick, a Gainesville crime prevention ofﬁ  cer. “That’s really what we’re here for. It’s what I’m here for and the reason I joined GPD.”
Mandatory bicycle registration pro-
grams have been employed in other Flor-ida cities like Fort Lauderdale, Daytona Beach and St. Petersburg, with either no cost or $1 fees to register and citations ranging from $10 to $93, Kurnick said.
The commission made no action on the 
agenda item but encouraged the promo-tion of the UPD and GPD programs.
“We already have a mechanism for 
(registration). We just may not have many people participating,” Mayor Ed Braddy said.City commission discusses

The panel of judges included UF Athlet-
ics Director Jeremy Foley, UF Student Body 
President Cory Yeffet and former Gators tail-back Errict Rhett — the ﬁ  rst celebrity honor-
ary Mr. Two-Bits.
“My entire family is full of UF alumni,” 
Comiter said. “My parents were Gators, my 
brothers were both Gators, my aunts and uncles were Gators and when my brother’s baby boy is born, he’s going to be a Gator, too.”
Alicia Longworth, assistant athletics di-
rector for the UAA’s marketing and promo-
tions department, said some freshmen — 
and even sophomores and juniors — have 
no idea how the tradition began.
Edmondson ﬁ  rst led his chant in The 
Swamp in 1949. The Gators were losing to Citadel, a team he was there to support, and 
Florida fans were booing their own team.
“I started off trying to cheer up a hand-
ful of people, and it kept growing, section by section, year by year, to what it was at the end,” Edmondson said.
Edmondson, who turned 92 in July, said 
his health makes it difﬁ  cult to attend home games, but he never misses a chance to cheer 
the Gators on from his home in Tampa.
“At my last game,” he said, “I was in the 
middle of the ﬁ  eld before 90,000 people, and 
I got one last cheer out of them.”
Comiter said his primary goal is to honor 
Edmondson and the rich tradition surround-ing the Two-Bits cheer, which has been his favorite part of Gator football games for as long as he can remember.
“All I can think about is doing it the exact 
way George Edmondson did it,” he said. “I don’t want to put my own twist on it. It’s so perfect the way it is.”He continues the traditionFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Fugitive task force learned of his whereabouts earlier this week
NW Sixth Ave. in Newberry. Along with 
West, a woman and two children were inside the mobile home, according to the release. 
Around 6:30 a.m. Thursday, task force members surrounded the mobile home and ordered those inside to come out. Carroll said West didn’t come outside right away. 
It took about 10 minutes for West to 
ﬁ  nally exit the mobile home. Once he did exit, he complied with the ofﬁ  cers without further incident.
The woman and two children were left unharmed.
After surrendering to the task force, 
West was arrested for his outstanding warrant, which included attempted mur-
der and robbery with a deadly weapon. 
West was booked at Alachua County Jail around 7:30 a.m. His bail is currently set at $400,000.West has a history of violent crime. In 
December 2006, he served about 11 months and in June 2008 he served about seven months — both for attempted robbery with 
a deadly weapon.  
In June 2012, West was charged with 
cocaine possession and served about eight 
months in prison.

When Katie Leigh ﬁ  rst opened the door to 
her temporary apartment Wednesday, she no-
ticed mud tracks from construction workers, leftover supplies in a closet and an unﬁ  nished kitchen cabinet. 
Leigh, a 21-year-old UF health science ju-
nior, was one of many Grove residents who moved into a temporary apartment this week while permanent apartments were being ﬁ  n-ished. The temporary apartments are located within the new Grove complex at 3477 Hull Road.“The furniture just looked like it had been 
thrown in there, and they shut the door,” Leigh said. 
This move came after residents were set up 
in hotels at the start of the semester.
Leigh lived in a hotel for 12 days as con-
struction continued at her Grove apartment. Campus Crest, which owns the new Grove complex, told Leigh her permanent apartment will be ready in about two weeks.
“We are working around the clock to en-
sure we properly address all outstanding is-sues so we can get residents into their units as quickly as possible,” wrote Campus Crest chief operating ofﬁ  cer Rob Dann in an email.
Until then, Leigh is cleaning her temporary 
home. She said she found a nail on the ﬂ  oor of her room and paint stains in the bathtub.
“When they said, ‘Oh, you can move into 
your temporary apartment,’ I wasn’t expect-ing to move into a construction zone in my hallway,” she said.
Christina Kelley, a 20-year-old UF psy-
chology junior, said the Grove deducted $100 from her September rent. But she said she still shouldn’t have had to pay the full amount for her August rent.
She said she’s heard what sounds like peo-
ple running up stairs, banging noises, drilling and vacuuming. She’s worried she’ll be in a temporary apartment for a month, she said.
“We just don’t feel settled,” Kelley said. 
“Our stuff is all still in boxes because we don’t want to have to unpack it and then move it out again.”

When night falls, some students may 
worry about walking out alone.
Eni Laska, a 19-year-old UF market-
ing sophomore, said the campus feels 
relatively safe until 10 p.m. 
“There’s less visibility, and I always 
try not to walk alone,” Laska said. “When I get the UF Alerts, I try to be watchful or just go inside.”
This comes after students received a 
slew of UF Alerts from police respond-ing to two sexual assaults reported around campus Saturday night. 
With the kickoff of the school year, 
students are finding ways to protect themselves. 
Student safety is a high priority, said 
Naomi Phineas, a University Police vic-tim advocate.
With mobile apps like TapShield and 
Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol, students can help protect themselves at night.
TapShield allows students to alert po-lice of their location. It is similar to the blue light emergency phones on cam-pus, Phineas said.  
SNAP also offers an app to locate its 
free nighttime transportation service that runs on campus from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.
If a student still needs a ride after 3 
a.m., he or she can call University Police and get a ride for free, Phineas said.
Students looking to take further pro-
tective measures can participate in UPD’s Rape Aggression Defense program. 
“RAD has been one of the most high-
interest programs UFPD provides,” said Tina Lamb, RAD program coordinator. “It has been and will continue to be.” 
The classes are open to students, fac-
ulty and staff. Once focused on women, the program now also provides men’s classes with the UF Men’s Leadership Committee, she said. 
For more help, students can seek as-
sistance from the 24/7 hotline provided by the Counseling & Wellness Center at 352-392-1575 or look to GatorWell’s 
STRIVE group. 
Lamb said it’s important for students 
to work together and take advantage of 
the opportunities to prevent sexual as-sault.Assaults prompt preventionFAculty

UF has hired a new director of real estate 
to oversee the university’s growing proper-
ties.
Lee Nelson, former director of real es-
tate and development for the Board of Re-gents of the University System of Georgia, was hired to take over for previous director 
Bruce Delaney.
Nelson, a graduate from Yale Universi-
ty, said he liked the breadth of responsibil-
ity the position at UF offered.
“(The university) has done a lot of inter-
esting things on the real estate front,” he said. “It’s hard to predict what we’ll con-tinue to develop in the future, but a lot of the developments the university has are all 
going to be very interesting.”
Nelson will be responsible for creating 
and executing a development plan for UF 
in Gainesville and around Florida. 
This includes buying, receiving and sell-
ing property for the university’s use, ac-cording to a university memo. 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said Nel-
son was the right fit for the position with 
his qualifications.
“I think if you look at his experience lev-el and the type of project he worked on in 
Georgia, you’ll see he is imminently quali-fied for this position,” he said.
According to the UF memo, Nelson had 
held his position in Georgia since 2010, where he was responsible for coordinating real estate transactions among 31 public universities.
Students on campus, 
such as 20-year-old UF art junior Allie Wright, ques-tioned whether the uni-versity needs more real 
estate development.
“None of the construc-
tion or development hin-
ders me in any way,” she 
said. “I do question if it’s necessary to have 
another building for the business majors, though.”
Nelson is set to start his position Sept. 
15.
Nelson said he is looking forward to be-
coming a part of The Gator Nation.
“Everybody I have met in this whole 
process has been absolutely marvelous to 
talk to and share ideas with,” he said. “I 
just think getting to work with a set of peo-ple like that is great.”New UF director of real estate

Former U.S. Sen. and Florida Gov. 
Bob Graham discussed the benefits 
of voting for the Florida Water and Land Conservation Amendment on Thursday.
At the public forum in Pugh Hall, 
Graham and David Hart, vice presi-dent of governmental affairs and political operations from the Florida Chamber of Commerce, debated the pros and cons of passing the consti-tutional amendment, which would provide funding to protect and manage conservation lands.
Amendment 1 would create a 
legacy for preserving rivers, lakes and springs for the future, Graham said at the forum.
“The amendment would be the 
key to protecting Florida’s water supply,” he said.
Attendees also contributed to the discussion by asking questions to both panelists.
If another recession were to hit, 
the government would have to cut funding elsewhere, Hart said.
“We don’t want our beaches 
looking like Coney Island on the Fourth of July,” Graham said.
Voters will be able to vote on the 
amendment this November.
Jenna Goldman, a 21-year-old UF 
history and political science senior, said she was still in favor of Amend-ment 1 after the debate.
“Knowing that we’ll always have 
money going toward the environ-ment in Florida is really important,” she said.Graham holds forum on

Darts & Laurels  
The big story at UF this week was the cancellation of 
the inaugural game of the 2014 Gator football season against Idaho. After hours of lightning delays, Gator 
fans got a small, exciting taste of the upcoming season 
when Valdez Showers — how appropriate — ran back the 
opening kickoff for 64 yards. Unfortunately, the game was 
immediately postponed, and eventually canceled, after more lightning was spotted nearby. For making The Gator Nation wait a whole extra week to start the football season, 
we give a really-bad-timing DART to Florida thunder-
storms.
National pharmacy chain CVS ﬁ  nally implemented a 
surprising and innovative policy this week. The company 
announced that it will no longer sell cigarettes and other 
tobacco products in its stores. Although government regu-lation and taxation of cigarettes have been largely effective in reducing smoking rates, this bold, voluntary stance by 
a large corporation sends a powerful anti-smoking mes-
sage. CVS Health anticipates a $2 billion loss in sales as a result of its decision, so this is more than just a minor branding strategy. Although some argue that those seeking cigarettes will just get their ﬁ  x elsewhere, making tobacco 
products less accessible is an excellent way to reduce the 
number of new smokers. We award a people-over-proﬁ  ts 
LAUREL to CVS Health.
Unlike CVS Health, which made the courageous decision 
to counter the scourge of smoking, a member of Florida’s con-
gressional delegation spent this week reinforcing one of our country’s uglier trends. The Hufﬁ  ngton Post reported that Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., sent out a fundraiser invita-tion that is sure to make the blood of any opponent of sexism boil. According to HuffPost, “The ‘small group of concerned men’ invited to a Republican congressman’s fundraiser were instructed to ‘tell the misses not to wait up’ so they could enjoy ‘after dinner whiskey and cigars’ without any women present.” Southerland’s campaign manager called the atten-tion being drawn to the email “laughable.” The only thing laughable about this situation is that Southerland and his ilk think that such overt sexism will go unnoticed by Florida voters. This week’s this-isn’t-the-1950s DART goes to Rep. 
Steve Sutherland.  
Although the weather last Saturday was about as bad 
as it gets, that didn’t stop Gator football fans from coming 
to The Swamp in droves. Even through the interminable 
weather delays, the fans at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium stayed 
enthusiastic and eager for the game to ﬁ  nally start. After a relatively disappointing 2013 campaign, the passion of The Gator Nation for the new season was truly a sight to be-hold. Let’s hope their energy helps carry the Gators to a big 
win over Eastern Michigan on Saturday and a successful 
season overall. An in-all-kinds-of-weather LAUREL to the 
best damn football fans in the country, The Gator Nation.
Nude photo hacking: breach of privacy
In the past week, I’ve seen more breasts than I can 
count.
With events like the nude photo leak of more than 
100 celebrities, which was deemed “The Fappening,” and the local leak of a photo showing sorority members ﬂ  ash-
ing, tits have taken over mainstream media.
This makes it the perfect time to gauge the trustworthi-
ness of your friends, partners and classmates in terms of 
sexual content.
Not sure what I mean?Maybe I’m being too sensitive, but if you actively 
sought out naked pictures that were leaked without con-sent, how can I trust you with my own pictures?
The answer: I can’t. Your treatment of these leaked na-
ked bodies is indicative of how you’ll treat my own body.
The people who made jokes about the leaked images 
and passed them around seem to be the very same peo-ple who ask for naked pictures from my friends and col-leagues.
It’s as if you’re saying, “Well, you shouldn’t take nudes 
if you don’t want people to share them, but yeah, babe, please send me some naked pictures.”
It doesn’t work that way, though.
Violating one person’s right to privacy is never OK, 
regardless of whether you know them in person or just 
watch them in movies.
Looking at those photos shows that you don’t respect 
the privacy and body autonomy of women, and I, for one, don’t want to be involved with someone who won’t re-spect me.
A column regarding the celebrity photo leak that ran 
in the Alligator on Wednesday made just that point — 
“Anyone who seeks out, views or shares these photos is 
complicit in the crime against these women by violating their privacy.” 
So if you texted your friends a picture of Kate Upton 
topless, who’s to say you won’t do the same with a picture sent to you by someone you actually know in real life — not just in your wet dreams?
The ironic part of all of this is that you seem to think you’re doing us a favor. 
But you can’t justify look-
ing at or sharing these photos without the subject’s consent by saying that they are hot, or by 
saying that they will further the 
subject’s career.
The Alpha Omicron Pi ﬂ  ash-
ing photo is a good example.
Yes, I saw the picture. Yes, the 
photo’s subjects were all unreasonably attractive.
But the photo was taken in what I’m sure was a private 
moment for the sorority. The photo wasn’t intended for my eyes, nor yours.
Regardless of your reasoning for sharing the photo, 
whether you thought it was funny or whether it turned you on, no reason is good enough to compromise the pri-vacy of those sorority sisters.
Your actions in regard to these photos don’t only trans-
late to other images. They reﬂ  ect your treatment of all sexual content.
Sharing a photo is the equivalent of giving your friends 
a very detailed description of any sexual encounter we 
had.
 These photos — and any sexual experience — should 
remain private unless both parties consent to sharing 
them.
If you’re lucky enough to receive a naked picture of 
someone, don’t mess that up by being a jerk.
Taking and/or sending nudes can be a great way to 
spice up your sex life.
But don’t ask for them if you are unable to keep them 
to yourself. Don’t screenshot photos on Snapchat for your personal enjoyment later, unless the sender has deemed that OK.
Everybody has the right to privacy. There’s no excuse 
to violate that just because you want to see someone’s cleavage.

Aug. 29 column misses underlying issues of 
tax inversions
Dear Editor,
This letter is in response to Joel Mendelson’s 
opinion piece on Aug. 29 about corporate tax inver-
sions. Forcing corporations to return to the U.S. in 
order to more fully share the burden of U.S. taxes completely misses the underlying issues. 
Despite the U.S. having the second highest cor-
porate tax rates in the world, corporations pay no taxes regardless. They simply act as government tax collectors, passing those costs onto consumers. 
The corporations’ use of loopholes that enable 
them to lower their tax burden actually helps to lower the cost of their products and services and remain competitive in a global market, beneﬁ  tting consumers.
 Joel’s comparison of a corporation’s ability 
to exploit this loophole to that of an individual is somewhat disingenuous, as an individual simply has different loopholes to exploit, such as the home mortgage interest deduction, itemized business and work deductions and child care expenses. 
The real issue lies in an overly burdensome tax 
code that allows business and government to ma-nipulate each other. 
The answer for a consumption-based society like 
the U.S. is a consumption-based tax like the Fair-Tax. The FairTax is a retail sales tax on all goods 
and services with no exemptions or loopholes. The 
government’s purchases would be taxed along with those of individuals. There would be little change in the cost of goods, as embedded taxes would be removed. The FairTax would make all taxes essen-
tially voluntary and allow people to keep 100 per-
cent of their paychecks.

Last week’s open letter to President Bernie 
Machen wrongfully condemns proclamation
I was taken aback by the recent open letter to UF 
President Bernie Machen in this past week’s Alliga-
tor.  In it, the author condemns Machen’s proclama-
tion, “I believe the entire University of Florida com-
munity holds academic freedom to be a cherished principle that advances the interests of society,” and challenges our president to use boycotts as the 
model for academic integrity.
A discussion focused on divestment is counter-
productive. It wrongly assumes that the Israeli-
Palestinian conﬂ  ict is a black and white issue and ignores the true complexity of the situation. 
By embracing the nuances, we can move toward 
constructive engagement, peaceful solutions and an atmosphere of economic and political cooperation. 
This is the approach currently outlined by the 
road map to peace plan, which encourages the nor-malization of relations between Israel and the Arab states, including trade links. Additionally, Mah-moud Abbas, the Palestinian authority’s recognized leader, has said he does not ask anyone to boycott 
Israel.
I am proud to be part of The Gator Nation be-
cause of  Machen’s decision to ensure that UF al-
ways cherishes academic freedom holding to the 
principles of democracy treasured by America and 
Israel. 
I am proud to stand with a student body whose 
Senate reinforced the president’s message last April by voting to respect academic freedom and invest in peace on this campus. And I am proud to be part of this community conﬁ  rming the words of our motto, “the welfare of the state depends upon the morals of its citizens.”
Moving forward, our role must be to work to-
gether toward solutions for a conﬂ  ict that has torn Israelis and Palestinians apart for centuries. 
My commitment is to uphold Machen’s words 
by building bridges that foster civil dialogue in an 
effort to understand one another, as well as to en-
courage investment and negotiation for shared fu-ture prosperity so that everyone may live side by side in peace and security.

For most Americans, the 
popularity of Congress is somewhere below 
cockroaches and colonosco-pies.
We prefer the idea of a doc-
tor probing our colon to the 
idea of the institution respon-
sible for creating our nation’s 
laws. That’s a big problem.
Congress is stricken with 
gridlock so badly, trafﬁ  c in Los Angeles moves as smoothly as a bowling ball down a waxed lane in comparison.
The dysfunction grips our 
country, preventing action on 
the major issues confronting 
the nation.
But there’s an even more 
potent and dangerous dis-ease seeping through the halls of the Capitol: the power of money.
Former House Majority 
Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., re-
cently resigned after losing in 
the Republican primary earlier this year. Cantor announced this week that he ﬁ  nally found a post-congressional job.
Instead of shoveling piles 
of elephant manure for the National Zoo, a job well suit-ed to his exploits as a former member of Congress, Cantor will make a paltry sum of $3.4 million to work for Moelis & Co., a New York City-based investment bank.
Is it wrong for a former 
member of Congress to take a new job with a signiﬁ  cantly higher salary?
Of course not.No one is arguing that 
former members of Congress should remain unemployed after they retire or lose re-elec-tion. Just like a normal mem-
ber of society, Eric Cantor did 
exactly what anyone who lost his or her job would do: ﬁ  nd a new one.
However, the nature of the 
job that Cantor was hired for demonstrates some of the fun-damental problems with our modern political system. 
Americans are still pretty 
peeved that Congress used 
taxpayer dollars to bail out 
the banks to the tune of $700 
billion following the stock market crash of 2008. Now, Cantor is going to work for the same industry bailed out by Congress. Making matters worse, Cantor will likely lob-by on behalf of the ﬁ  rm, which tasked Cantor with setting up 
an ofﬁ  ce based in Washing-
ton, D.C. 
Cantor will likely succeed 
at his new gig, given the fact that he was the No. 2 Republi-can in the House for years. His knowledge of the legislative process, his fellow represen-
tatives and how to make sure 
Moelis & Co.’s interests are protected will suit him well. However, it proves that his constituents were probably right when they ﬁ  red him ear-lier this year.
Let’s face it: Eric Cantor — 
like so many other members 
of Congress — put his own 
interests ahead of his constitu-ents’. 
Cantor’s recent loss high-
lights the frustration most Americans have toward Con-gress.
Despite having every ad-
vantage over his tea party chal-
lenger, Cantor lost because he 
spent little time in his Virginia district, preferring the slime of Washington, D.C. 
Voters were frustrated and 
upset that their representative was simply another cog in the system and no longer did the job he was hired to do: repre-
sent his constituents.
When the paychecks from 
Moelis & Co. start rolling in, 
it’s likely that Cantor will numb the sting of his shock-ing loss, but what he doesn’t have anymore is power.
Sure, he’s still the former 
House majority leader and can 
bend the ear of almost every 
Republican in Congress, but for all intents and purposes, his real power vanished when he resigned from his post.
Like Cinderella’s carriage, 
Eric Cantor is once again a pumpkin, shilling for the ﬁ  -nancial industry like an un-
told number of hacks. He 
can’t use special entrances and exits into and out of the Capitol, and there’s no longer a congressional ofﬁ  ce with his name on it. He’s just another normal American who hap-pens to making a seven-ﬁ  gure salary.
Cantor may not care about 
losing his lawmaking power as long as he gets his checks. However, his loss of power is a victory for his constituents in Virginia and Americans throughout the country des-perately seeking true leader-ship and representation in the 
halls of Congress.

Maude’s Classic Cafe is now 
serving more than espresso.
The downtown cafe opened 
its next-door beer and wine bar, 
Sidecar, in July. Owner and 
manager Matthew Wrighton 
said Sidecar offers live music, a monthly comedy night and a poetry slam.
The cozy bar has a groovy 
atmosphere inspired by a trip to San Francisco, Wrighton said. 
Its couch doubles as a stage, 
and lava lamps glow next to a 
gray furry wall.
“It’s visually entertaining,” 
he said.
Juliane Miklos, a 21-year-old UF alumna, went to Maude’s 
every other week while at UF.
“I’d love to go to Sidecar 
based on my experience at Maude’s,” Miklos said, “I love the atmosphere there.”
Wrighton said he hosted a 
20-person taste test to choose the bar’s selection of beers and wine.
“There’s a lot of detail go-
ing into what you’re going to drink,” he said.
Andy Fass, the owner and 
chef at Amelia’s, an Italian res-taurant across the street, said he 
is excited about the opening of 
Sidecar.
The two businesses have

ElderCare of Alachua County hosted its 
fourth annual “Something New in Orange 
and Blue 2014” fashion show and tailgate event Thursday night at the Alachua County Senior Recreation Center.
All event proceeds beneﬁ  ted the organi-
zation’s programs and services at the facility. Fashion show models wore clothes from John Isaac, Alumni Hall, Belk and Ilene’s For Fash-ion.
“What we’re doing is previewing fashion-
able items in orange and blue for people to kick off the football season,” said executive 
director of ElderCare Anthony Clarizil.
The night began with guest speaker Al-
bert Fox, a member of ElderCare, who ex-
plained the role the center’s activities had in his weight loss transformation. He played the song “What Does The Fox Say?” on stage and shook his hips to the music.
“I am a winner,” Fox said.At about 6:30 p.m., the mix of models be-
gan to walk the runway, ranging from seniors at the center to employees from UF Health Shands Hospital and local government.
One of the models, Emily Burris, wore 
Alumni Hall clothing. She chomped her way down the orange carpet to ﬁ  nish with a twirl.
Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell wore 
Ilene’s For Fashion and posed twice on the runway with her blue scarf, orange cardigan, blue pants and blue sandals.
Other models walked down the stage with 
their children and spouses.
“The whole evening ties around sports,” 
Clarizil said. “We have an event like this so 
we can continue providing all of our services, with the exception of our ﬁ  tness center, for free for our members.”
ElderCare is a 100 percent grant- and dona-
tion-funded program of Shands. Clarizil said 
its members are able to come to the facility for activities like Zumba or arts and crafts for free.
After the fashion show, ElderCare auc-
tioned off sporting packages.
Daisy Lopez, a 19-year-old UF economics 
student and Sigma Kappa Sorority member, volunteered as a greeter.
“Everyone is really happy. Everyone is in 
their Gator attire,” Lopez said. “It’s nice to see everyone coming together for this event.” ElderCare holds annual fashion show fundraiser for members

With two months until Elec-

incumbent Republican Gov. Rick 
Scott leading Democratic nominee Charlie Crist by a six-point mar-
gin.
The results indicated a signifi-
cant turnaround for Scott after 
a similar February poll released 
showed him trailing Crist by sev-en points.
The poll was conducted by the 
Bob Graham Center for Public 
Service with UF’s Bureau of Eco-nomic and Busi-
ness Research, 
the Tampa Bay Times and Bay 
News 9. 
“Scott’s cam-
paign seems to 
be more success-ful than Crist’s 
in terms of having direct contact with voters,” said UF political sci-ence professor Michael Martinez.
The poll of 920 registered Flor-
ida voters suggests that Florid-
ians are weighing many factors in 
choosing a candidate, said Chris-topher McCarty, director of UF Bureau of Economic and Business Research. 
“The numbers are useful to the candidates’ campaigns, but they also give places like the Graham Center valuable information to inform voters on how the race is 
shaping up,” McCarty said.
The Graham Center is confi-

The UF Department of Chemical Engineering will celebrate 
its 75th anniversary Friday from 4 to 8 p.m. at the new Chemi-
cal Engineering Student Center.
 More than 200 students, faculty and almuni are expected to 
attend the event featuring live music, a buffet, guest speakers 
and an unveiling of the wall of fame, which recognizes alumni, 
faculty members and donors who have given the biggest con-tributions to the department.
Attendees can also partake in tours offered to showcase the new student center and the department labs. 
The student center, which opened in Fall 2013, hosts the 
academic advising center, department administration, a con-ference room and a student collaboration space.
Monique Phears, assistant to the chair with the department 
of chemical engineering, said the energy around the event has prompted several people to try to register last minute.
“People are pretty excited — students too,” Phears said. “I 
think it’s good for them to see the alumni coming back.” 
Several alumni have made $75 donations for the depart-
ment’s 75th anniversary to nominate the professors who have made the most impact.
“Alumni can reminisce and talk about the impact the de-
partment had on their lives and careers and say something meaningful about that,” said Richard Dickinson, chair of the 
UF department of chemical engineering.

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested after stalking a woman 
and masturbating in front of her house Wednesday morning.
Benjamin Franklin Cun-
ningham, 25, was arrested at about 9 a.m. and charged with trespass after warning, stalking and exposure of sexual organs. Cunningham had been harass-ing and following the victim and her son since November of last year, said Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
On Tuesday, Cunningham 
approached the victim as she was going inside her apart-ment. When the victim looked out the peephole, she saw Cun-ningham masturbating while staring at her door. The victim then opened the door.
“Come help me,” he said.Tobias said the victim did 
not tell police about the mas-
turbation incident out of fear of 
Cunningham. Instead, she noti-fied her apartment manager. 
After she dropped her son 
off at school Wednesday morn-ing, she arrived to her apart-
ment to find Cunningham wait-
ing for her outside. He insisted that they talk privately about the incident. 
Ignoring the victim’s request 
to leave her alone, Cunningham followed and yelled at her.

rested for being on the property Wednesday.Local man arrested,

Rivers died at Mount Sinai

as she aged, her 
wit remained as vibrantly raw and unruly as when she first 
broke her way 
into a comedy world belonging 
largely to men.
In a 2010 “Late Show” inter-
view, David Letterman broached the plastic surgery issue: “You don’t look exactly like the Joan Rivers I used to know.” Rivers 
was unapologetic.
Joan Rivers was fearless.
Or, to be more accurate, a hu-
morist who fearlessly spun fears 
into gold.
“The trouble with me is, I 
make jokes too often,” she told 
The Associated Press in 2013. “That’s how I get through life. 
Life is so difficult — everybody’s 
been through something! But you laugh at it, it becomes smaller.”
So she made fears evaporate, 
at least for a moment. She blew them up with relish.Comedian, actor and writer, 
Louis C.K., said in a statement. “I 
never saw someone attack a stage 
with so much energy. She was a controlled lightning bolt. She was a prolific and unpredictable, joy-
ful joke writer. She loved comedy. 
She loved the audience. She was a great actress and should have done that more. She loved living and working. She was kind. She 
was real. She was brave. She was 
funny and you just wanted to be around her. I looked up to her. I learned from her. I loved her. I 
liked her. And I already miss her 
very much.” 
Comedian Joan Rivers dead at 81 after August cardiac arrest

Week 2 of college football contains matchups such as No. 7 Michigan State vs. No. 3 Oregon and Virginia Tech vs. No. 8 Ohio State. Read more about them at alligatorSports.org.Muschamp announces captains
Football coach Will Muschamp announced on Twitter that Chaz Green, Max Garcia, Jabari Gorman and Mike Taylor will be team captains against Eastern Michigan.Mother Nature got the best of 
Florida football on Saturday.
Thunderstorm after thunder-
storm and more than two and a half 
inches of rain turned the Swamp into just that and forced Florida’s season opener against Idaho to be 
suspended and ultimately ruled a 
no contest.
But we here at alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column would rather focus on the sunny days that lie 
ahead.
What? There’s supposed to be 
rain and thunderstorms at the start 
of the Eastern Michigan game, too? Well, there goes that.
Debating the game of the week — 
No. 14 Southern California  vs. No. 13 Stanford — are alligatorSports staff 
writer Jonathan Czupryn and alliga-
torSports Editor Jordan McPherson.
Stanford (-2.5) will drown USC’s 
hopes of winning because …
My boy Richard Johnson says it 
best: Offensive linemen win champi-onships. OK, so maybe that’s a little 
hyperbolic, but you get what I’m 
saying. David Shaw’s “black and blue” brand of smashmouth football starts and ends with that monstrous front five of his. And the Cardinal are known to use a jumbo set up front 
that actually puts anywhere from 
seven to nine offensive linemen on the field at the same time. The Tro-jans defense cannot handle Shaw’s 
power-type system and the Cardinal 
will hog the ball all game. USC’s of-fense looked efficient in the season opener, but it’s hard to score points when you can’t get on the field.

Alligator Writer @ibcohen5
Florida would have relished a win last night 
against Florida State.
In part to relieve the bad taste in its mouth, 
still lingering after its loss to FSU in last year’s 
NCAA tournament. But more so because of the difficult stretch of teams UF must face over the next couple of weeks.
Despite a closely contested match, the No. 11 
Gators (3-1) couldn’t pull out a win against the No. 8 Seminoles (3-0), falling 3-2 on Thursday in Tallahassee.
“There were a lot of good things tonight,” 
coach Mary Wise said. “We’re not hanging out heads. This is early season, you kidding me? With starting two freshmen, to go in, in this en-vironment, and go five (sets) with (FSU)? It’s as great a performance as we’ve ever had here in 
Tully gym.”
The effort was present for Florida, but the ex-
ecution was lacking. Florida had a season-high 
20 service errors and just three blocks on the 
night.
“You’re not going to beat a top-10 opponent 
on the road with 20 unforced errors,” Wise said. 
“The service errors, we have the ability to score some points, we just kept shooting ourselves in 
the foot. And we had no business winning that 
first set.”

string of errors, but rallied behind Alex Holston UF volleyball

Of the women’s soccer matches this week-
end, only Florida and Florida State will head-
line a match that contains two top-10 ranked 
opponents. 
The No. 8 Gators and No. 2 Seminoles will 
play tonight at 7 for the first match since both 
programs made a weekend road trip from the Midwest. Florida State (4-0) and 
Florida (3-1) both shared 
victories over Oklahoma 
State — UF taking a 4-0 
win in regulation while FSU won 2-1 in dou-ble-overtime. 
But ultimately Florida State left the Sooner 
state undefeated as Florida fell to Oklahoma 2-1 while the Seminoles had a 1-0 win in Nor-man, Okla. 
Now both teams meet back in their home state, and the Gators are seeking revenge af-ter losing 3-0 in last season’s meeting. 
“They have a lot of returners,” coach Becky 
Burleigh said. 
“Dagny (Brynjarsdottir) the kid on top is 
still a big factor. She’s their attacking mid. They have lost a couple of kids that played 
pretty significant roles in the pro leagues so 
that’s tough to replace. All of us lose players and gain players. FSU seems to reload quite a bit.”
And in 2014, the Seminoles have reloaded. 
So far, FSU is 4-0 for a third consecutive year UF soccer heads to Tallahassee to face FSU

Mary Wise
UF Volleyball Coachand enter the match having won 
the last four of five contests against the Gators.
Florida State has won 10 of the 
last 16 matches against Florida, including three in a row, which is FSU’s longest win streak versus 
UF. 
“FSU is always really, really 
good,” said forward Savannah Jor-
dan, who leads the team in goals this season with three. “A tough 
team and obviously they rival for 
us. I think it’s going to be a good competition. 
“We’re both really good teams 
and I have complete confidence in my team going in. We feel good this week, ready in practice and we’ll have a good chance this weekend.”
Florida is looking to prevent 
Florida State from running away with the match in the first half, something that the Gators experi-enced last year at James G. Pressly Stadium.
Of FSU’s three goals in 2013, 
Brynjarsdottir scored two goals within two minutes and nine sec-onds in the first half of the contest. 
However, Florida has played 
well in first halves this season only allowing one goal through the first 45 minutes of contests so far in 2014.
“It’s always a big game,” Bur-
leigh said. “I just think we always respect having a good opponent. We want our opponents to bring 
their best and we certainly expect 
that from FSU.”FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Now onto the picks!
In first place with a 6-1 record 
is the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar 
“Scarface” Thompson, who said 
at a media availability this week 
that if he were to have a rags-to-riches story, it would be slightly similar to the one portrayed by Tony Montana. Well, based on your success through one week in the picks column, is it too early to say hello to your little friend?
Trailing Edgar by one game 
with a 5-2 record is alligator-Sports.org Editor Richard “Of-fensive Line Play” Johnson, who probably talked more about Tex-
as A&M and Stanford’s o-lines 
on Wednesday’s alligatorSports podcast than anyone ever wants to hear. Oh, and he hates Chipo-
tle. How do you even live? 
Also in second place is alliga-
torSports staff writer Jonathan 
“What’s his last name?” Czupryn, 
whose surname is so damn hard 
to pronounce that the people at the SEC’s weekly teleconference didn’t even attempt to say it. Why 
can’t you be like the rest of mod-
ern society and have a last name that people can at least guess its pronunciation? 
Finishing up the three-way tie 
for second is alligatorSports staff writer Morgan “I LOVE TODD GURLEY” Moriarty, who tweet-ed excessively about the Georgia running back while we waited in 
the press box for Florida’s game 
that never came last weekend. WE GET IT. Gurley’s a beast. You don’t have to fill our timelines 
with the same damn thing every 
30 seconds.
Rounding out the alligator-
Sports group in fifth place with 
a 4-3 clip is Sports Editor Jor-
dan “I’m too young for this s**t” McPherson, who was caught with a deer-in-the-headlights 
look when Alligator Photo Editor 
Kan Li snapped a photo of him in the press box Saturday. It’s a big and scary world out there Jordan so if you ever feel like you need a hand to hold, Edgar sits right 
next to you. And we all know he’s 
seen his fair share of s**t in this world.
In a tie for sixth place with a 
3-4 record is Nick “Facts aren’t relevant” de la Torre, who tried to make the argument that Idaho’s football stadium (cap. 16,000) 
couldn’t hold as many people 
as UF’s O’Connell Center (cap. 11,548) during media availability this week. I guess facts don’t mat-ter when you’re trying to make a 
point, right?
Also in sixth place batting 
under .500 is Landon “Literally could find things to talk about 
for 48+ hours” Watnick, who blabbed on so much during me-dia availability Wednesday that our own Richard Johnson had to move across the room just to get 
some work done. Landon, I get 
that you’re on a new and exciting adventure after locking up this job with Inside the Gators, but  GOOD GOD CUT US A BREAK! 
We have to listen to people ramble 
on all day long so when we have a little peace and quiet, PLEASE LET US HAVE A LITTLE PEACE 
AND QUIET!
And in dead-ass last with a 
piss-poor record of 2-5 is Thomas 
“I’m probable” Goldkamp, who 
was called out by Will Muschamp 
for not being on his injury report Monday after he cut his thumb on a plate. Really? A plate? Are we 
going to have to send you back to 
the kiddie table?
picks , from page 14soccer , from page 14Jordan leads UF with 
three goals in 2014Holston had a career-high 24 kills
to capture a 30-28 victory and 
take a 1-0 lead. 
The sophomore led Florida 
with a season-high 24 kills and a .447 hitting percentage.
“We’re definitely an ag-
gressive serving team, and 
(errors) are always going to 
happen when you serve ag-gressive,” Holston said. “Es-pecially playing a team like Florida State with such great 
servers.”
After FSU tied the match 
with a 25-21 win in the second 
set, Wise moved Holston from 
the front to the back row. The 
change immediately shifted the momentum in Florida’s favor.
“I think (the move) was re-
ally effective,” Holston said. “It was a great call by Mary for me to play the back row. I think one thing is, we haven’t 
really seen that type of of-fense yet this year, so I think it was a great way to mix it up. 
I have different players open for different springs and dif-ferent blocks.”
Florida trailed 15-10 in the 
third set when Wise made the change, propelling the Gators to a 25-23 victory.
But the fast-paced Florida 
State offense was too much to overcome, and FSU captured the next two sets 25-23 and 15-9, respectively.
Overshadowed in the loss 
were strong performances from juniors Noami Santos-
Lamb, who recorded 12 kills, 
and Simone Antwi, with 11.
“We lost, but our effort 
(was) so good,” Wise said. “You think about Holly Pole, 
first time libero. Carli Sny-
der, first time in this position. Noami, first time. Rhamat (Alhassan), Mackenzie (Da-
gostino), first time. Those are 
five first time players playing in this environment, and what an awesome job they did.”
Florida’s schedule only 
gets more difficult. In the coming weeks, they will face No. 3 Texas, No. 15 San Diego and No. 6 USC.
“All of our games this year 
are going to be challenging,” Holston said. “Every team we face will teach us something new about ourselves, so we’re 
going to see what we can 
work on.”

After failing to make the NCAA Champi-
onships during its spring season, the Florida 
men’s golf team looks to redeem itself start-ing today as it tees off for its fall schedule at the Carpet Capital Collegiate Classic in 
Dalton, Ga. 
The tournament — played on the par-72 
Farm Golf Club Course — totals 54 holes of 
stroke play extended over three days.  
Coach J.C. Deacon will be making his Gators’ coaching debut, and Florida will face some of the top teams in the country 
during the weekend event — 
including Southeastern Conference foes No. 
1 Alabama, No. 11 LSU, No. 20 South Caro-lina, No. 22 Auburn and Tennessee. The host of the event, Georgia Tech, is ranked No. 2 in the country.
UF’s lineup will include senior J.D. Tom-
linson, who competed in every tournament last season. The Gainesville native ﬁ  nished 
last year with ﬁ  ve top 10 ﬁ  nishes, and three 
top ﬁ  ve ﬁ  nishes. Tomlinson said the team as a whole has improved leading up to the tournament.“We’re playing pretty well as a team,” 
Tomlinson said. “We didn’t really lose any-body from last year, everybody is starting to 
play a lot better and I think we can play re-
ally well this week.”
Joining Tomlinson in Florida’s lineup 
will be senior Thomas Stewart, who com-peted in only two events last season — both in the fall. Thomas stepped up and won the qualifying tournament during the week.
“That’s what you want to see out of your 
seniors, guys who step up,” Deacon said. 
“You don’t have to get in anyone’s face or 
say anything, but you got to lead by ex-ample, and Thomas and J.D. were actually one, two in the qualifying, so coaches dream right there.”
The Gators will also be sending junior 
Richard Donegan — who transferred to 
Florida in spring 2013 — and sophomore 
Conor Richardson who competed in three tournaments last season. Sophomore Ryan Orr , who ﬁ  nished his freshman campaign with a career-best 215 at the SEC Champion-ship, rounds out UF’s lineup.
“I can’t wait, competing is what I do best, 
I love it, it fuels me, that’s why I wake up in the morning,” Deacon said. “When we get 
to the golf tournaments, I love winning and 
I love competing, especially in the SEC now, what an opportunity to beat some great schools.”

It’s been a while since Quin-
ton Dunbar left a game without a 
catch.
The redshirt senior wide receiv-
er has a UF-record 28-game recep-tion streak, dating back to Flori-da’s 54-32 win against Furman on 
Nov. 19, 2011.
Prior to Dunbar’s record-set-
ting streak, UF’s consecutive-catch 
streak was 25 games, set by Carlos Alvarez from 1969-1971.
And with Florida’s second at-
tempt at a season opener set for Saturday against Eastern Michi-gan, Dunbar will look to continue 
that streak, but offensive coordina-
tor Kurt Roper will not be looking solely to Dunbar to make plays on the opposite end of Jeff Driskel.
“I think you’re obviously 
aware of those type of things and want to be fair to a young man,” Roper said. “It doesn’t affect game planning or it doesn’t affect the 
thought process. Our ﬁ  rst goal is 
to go out there and win, but we would obviously like to help him keep that streak alive.”
Dunbar, who led all of Florida’s 
returning receivers from its 2013 campaign with 40 catches and 548 yards, is continuing to develop his rhythm with Driskel.
The Miami native said that 
Driskel and the wide receivers are starting to get on the same page, especially with deep passes.
“It comes from the offseason,” 
Dunbar said. “We threw a lot of deep balls, probably like, 10 to 15 a day after weights. ... You can tell that it’s paying off. The timing is 
down with the receivers and the quarterbacks.”
And even with the return of 
redshirt senior Andre Debose, 
the progression of junior Latroy Pittman and the development of 
sophomores Ahmad Fulwood 
and Demarcus Robinson, Dunbar is still viewed as a mentor among the wide receiver corps.
“Q’s probably our biggest lead-
er in the receiver unit,” Fulwood said. “He’s been here the longest, he’s made probably the most plays out of all of us, he doesn’t get the 
attention he should but I mean I 
think he’s comfortable being un-der the radar still making plays that he needs to make.”
Driskel has seen improvements 
from some of the less experienced receivers throughout training camp and, like Roper, said there is the potential for several of them to 
have a breakout year.
“Ahmad Fulwood really 
knows what he’s doing out there,” 
Driskel said. “He’s made some big 
plays in camp and I can’t wait for 
him to do that in the season. He has a good understanding of the offense. I think Latroy Pittman is going to have a good year as well.  
Strong hands, smart football play-
er and that’s what you need at the receiver position.”
Fulwood, who caught 17 pass-
es for 127 yards and a touchdown last season, said his development over the past year has been night and day.
“I felt like I was a lot more 
comfortable than any time last year, even though I ﬁ  nished off kind of strong last year,” Fulwood said. “I feel like this training camp 
I really had to show what I could 
do. It was all about making the high balls, making the balls some people can’t make, making those catches.”
Through his ﬁ  rst two seasons 
at Florida, Pittman has just four catches for 24 yards.
After being a four-star recruit out of Citra (Fla.) North Marion High, he’s ready to play.
“I mean coming in having suc-
cess, you expect to have a great season and come out and make 
things happen for the team right away,” he said. “But it didn’t 
break that way and at the end of the day it humbled me. But I’m ready to step up and make plays now.”
