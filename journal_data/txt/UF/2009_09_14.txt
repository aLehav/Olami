TROY 6 ig 4P UF 56
Gators trounce Trojans; date with Vols looms
* KIFFIN'S COMMENTS ARE
POSTED IN THE LOCKER
ROOM.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
After Saturday's 56-6 romping of
Troy, it took Florida no time at all to
publicly turn its attention to Tennes-
see.
Privately, the Gators have been
eyeing Saturday's showdown with
the Volunteers and new head coach
Lane Kiffin, who made waves with a
variety of offseason comments about
Florida, since the team reported for
fall practice.
Offensive lineman James Wilson,
who committed to play for Kiffin
when he was an assistant coach at
USC, said there has been a calendar
in the weight room counting down
the days until Tennessee comes to
town.
"It's all over our locker room, that's
something you don't forget," Wilson
said. "It's going to be a show."
The Volunteers mark the first con-
ference test for the Gators, who did
exactly what was expected of them in
their two warmup games.
UF dominated on defense, lookedexplosive on offense and made a few
big special teams plays, all while get-
ting the backups plenty of work as
the starters came off the field by the
third quarter.
The final whistle at the end of the
Troy game marked nothing more
than the start of the third week of the
season and the usual matchup with
the Volunteers.
"I would be lying if I said there's
not a little something different when-
ever we play Tennessee or one of the
rivals, and I think that's a great thing
about it," UF quarterback Tim Tebow
said. "That's the great thing about it
and about SEC play, it's a little dif-
ferent."
It may feel a little different for
Tebow and his teammates, but UF
has made Tennessee look like just an-
other team the last two years.
When the Volunteers last came to
The Swamp in 2007, the Gators put 59
points on the board on their way to a
39-point win, and a year ago, Tebow
and company leaned on the defense
in a 30-6 victory in Knoxville.
Tennessee has made a coaching
change since then, replacing long-
time coach Phillip Fulmer with Kif-
fin, who wasted no time reviving the
rivalry upon his arrival.

Machen slashes $16M

UF will try to avoid more cuts to aca-
demic programs when it cuts the remain-
ing $16.6 million from its budget, UF Presi-
dent Bernie Machen said Friday.
Machen told the Board of Trustees the
remaining cuts will come from administra-
live programs, such as sick leave payouts.
Outlining his plan, Machen told trust-
ees that UF could save between $2 million
and $4 million if it eliminated sick leave

Employees who don't use their sick
days are paid after leaving UF. That pro-
gram would be cut under the proposal.
In another proposal, UF would start
paying faculty
U F a fixed summerAdministration rate. Under this,
some senior fac-
ulty would get a pay cut, according to UF's
Web site.
All told, UF's current plans could cut
up to $8.5 million. The rest of the cuts are
still in the air, Machen said.UF ACADEMICS
UF plans new study center
BY THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@a Iigator org
UF is planning a new study center to
give students some extra reading room.
Though the university still has to cut
$16.6 million from its budget this year,
it plans to use $12 million in stimulus
funds to build a 24-hour study center on
campus.
"This is a project that is badly in
need," UF President Bernie Machen told
the Board of Trustees Friday.
"If you come by the library at 5
o'clock, you can see that it's packed," he
said.
"People are using the library for

Because stimulus funds can't be used
on new construction projects, an existing
building on campus
must be modified into
the study center.
Officials declined
to say where the new
study center will be lo-
cated, but Ed Poppell,
UF's vice president for
Machen business affairs, said
it will be on the north
side of campus and close to food ven-
ues.
UF will get about $41 million in stim-

Reading center gets
50 percent budget cut
* TUTORING CENTER SEES
REDUCED STAFF, HOURS.
By OLGA VELEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students seeking help with com-
mas and colons may run into trouble
due to budget cuts at the Reading and
Writing Center.
"We have seen a 50 percent budget
cut," said Martin Simpson, the director
of the center, which is located on the
Broward Hall's mezzanine level.
Simpson said one of the biggest ef-
fects of the cuts, which were made in
July, is the center's hours.
The center used to be open to stu-
dents from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday. Now it is open 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday
and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Friday.
The center has also reduced its staff
by almost half, Simpson said.

AV1and now we are down to about seven,"
he said. "Of those 13, there were only
two layoffs. The rest were people who
had graduated."
Shorter hours and fewer employees
have affected the center's services.
Tutor Ariel Gunn said the number
of walk-ins the center can accomodate
has decreased.
"Before, probably maybe half or
more of our busi-
U F ness was walk-ins,Academics andnowweareable
to see maybe one or
two walk-ins a day," Gunn said.
It is also becoming more difficult
for students to make an appointment.
"We book several days in advance
so that it is becoming harder and hard-
er for them to make appointments and
come in," said Tutor Lauren Glenn.
"We are at the beginning of the
semester right now, and it is already
busy. I am guessing that we are going
to have to turn people away at an un-
believable rate," she said.Dogs, owners run for cause

Runners of two species crowded the start-
ing line at Saturday's Dog Days Run at West-
side Park, waiting for the race to begin.
UF's College of Veterinary Medicine and
the Florida Track Club hosted the 28th annual
run. The event included a 5K run for people, a
1-mile Fun Run for dogs and their owners, a
raffle and awards ceremony.
"It brings out a lot of people in the commu-
nity and connects them with the vet school,"
said Annie Martin, the event coordinator and a
second-year student at UF's veterinary school.
Leslie Lear and Rob Barnes attended the
event for their third year to support the vet
school and have fun with their dogs.
"We like doing this because it's for a good
cause," Lear said. "The vet school takes care
of our dogs. They've really helped us when
they've gotten in trouble."

Volunteers feed 120 homeless in honor of Ramadan
0 ABOUT 70 VOLUNTEERS
SERVED FOOD DOWNTOWN.
By NICOLE LA HOZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
On Friday, about 120 of
Gainesville's homeless gathered
around the Bo Diddley Commu-
nity Plaza's picnic area to eat In-
dian food.
In honor of Ramadan, the Mus-
lim Association of North Central
Florida (MANCF) got together
with Project Downtown, a group
of volunteers who serve food to
the homeless every Saturday af-
ternoon.
UF graduate student Ziad
Ghanimi said in a press release
that during Ramadan, Muslims
abstain from food or drinks from
sunrise to sunset to experience
what the less fortunate face every
day.
Ghanimi, MANCF spokesman
and Project Downtown board
member, said about 70 volunteers
came to help out.
Ghanimi said each week vol-
unteers cook anything from Mo-
roccan to Pakistani to American
dishes to hand out to the localhomeless population.
Shands at UF pediatric oph-
thalmologist Nausheen Khud-dus, who brought food to the
community plaza and volunteers
regularly, said giving back is partof her religion.

the homeless who came left with
a positive impact.
Both MANCF and Project
Downtown ensure that the orga-
nizations do not spread religious
messages.
The goal is to "feed only, not
to preach," Ghanimi said, add-
ing they can get their sandwiches
and go or choose to stay and so-

Editorial
Corporate Cost
Court should keep limits
on campaign ads
he Supreme Court is debating whether to overthrow
campaign finance laws that prohibit corporations
from spending unlimited amounts of money on po-
litical advertisements and endorsements right before an
election.
The issue originally came to the court when it was asked
to decide whether "Hillary: The Movie," produced by a
nonprofit corporation, fell into the category of "electioneer-
ing communication." In the rehearing, the Supreme Court
evoked the broader issue of First Amendment rights.
By definition, a corporation is a legally separate entity
from those who own or operate it. Limiting the political out-
put of a corporation, then, does not infringe on First Amend-
ment rights to free speech for any individual.
If the Supreme Court overturns laws like the McCain-
Feingold Act, it will be similar to letting those with the most
money scream the loudest (and last) and have the most per-
vasive influence on American politics.
The Roberts court needs to recognize that a corporation
is not an individual.
It also needs to recognize that many investors in corpora-
tions are foreign individuals or entities. The money funneled
by corporations into political action committees is enough.
Not to mention that any country that gives a mega-cor-
poration the leverage to potentially destroy any non-allied
political candidate is basically the opposite of a democracy.
Swift Rebuke
While we didn'tknow that anyone
still watched the
MTV Video Music Awards
(the last time we remem-
ber watching it, it involved
strawberry yogurt with
rainbow sprinkles and the
privilege of staying up late),
it came to our attention that
a certain atrocity occurred
on last night's show.
After checking Facebook
at work, we had some vague
indication (or about 700 no-
tifications) that Kanye West
acted like Kanye West, and
apparently, his actions re-
sulted in outrage.
Being responsible jour-
nalists, we quickly flocked
to PerezHilton.com to see
footage of the outburst.
Swift's video is an atroci-
ty. It follows a mute girl who
is in love with her next door
neighbor and can only com-
municate with him through
handwritten signs.
She eventually wins theheart of the quarterback.
Predictable much?
Kanye West decided it
was permissible to jump on
stage and declare Beyonc6
the "real" winner of the Best
Female Music Video award
Beyonc6 's video is un-
doubtedly superior, but
we would like to denounce
Kanye West for both hurt-
ing that poor girl's feelings
and wasting our valuable
time at work.
We can only imagine
Swift's internal reaction, but
we thinkher tender, 19-year-
old heart was likely impaled
on that moonman's flag.
Kanye West's actions are
unacceptable, even if they
were on a low-rate award
show for a dead medium.
His constant search for
validation and attention
reached a new low when
he decided to showcase his
egoism at the expense of a
girl on the cusp of achieving
her dreams.

REWARD:
a great experience
Column
he United States of America desperately needs Wil-
liam F. Buckley to rise up from the grave.
As the erudite founder of the National Review
and host of the television political debate show "Firing
Line," Buckley gave conservatism a great name and mes-
sage with his more than 30 books on the subject.
When the avid sailor, who hailed from Connecticut and
attended Yale, died more than a year ago, so did the last
chance of ever intellectualizing politics again.
Buckley, one of the founders of the modern conserva-
tive movement that ushered Ronald Reagan into office,
was the very definition of the elitism so many conserva-
tives today are taught to disdain.
He was a New England sailor educated in the best pri-
vate schools. A man who drove an Austin Healey instead
of a Dodge Ram, and the only Irish Catholic who could
manage to make Gore Vidal sound like an undereducated
simpleton, instead of the snob he resembles. But Buckley
wasn't an elitist for those reasons; he was an elitist because
he was always the smartest man in the room.
And because of this certitude -this, as some would
call, arrogance -Buckley would have never howled "You
Lie!" at the president of the United States during a joint
session of Congress, as Congressman Joe Wilson, R-S.C.,
did Wednesday night. Buckley simply would have scoffed
quietly, and then eloquently made his point after the pres-
ident had finished his address.
Besides the single time he ran for mayor of New York
City in the 1960s as a way to steal votes away from an-
other Republican candidate whose conservative creden-
tials Buckley doubted, Buckley himself was too smart to
have ever run for public office. He knew that the mass
public wouldn't have been as impressed as his fellow Yale
debate teammates were by his expansive vocabulary and
penchant for reasoned postulation. Buckley knew who the

"The best argument against de-
mocracy is a five-minute conversa-
tion with the average voter," Winston Churchill once hu-
morously said. When thousands marched on Washington
Saturday holding posters of President Barack Obama and
Speaker Nancy Pelosi with Adolf Hitler mustaches doo-
dled on, some are probably wondering if Churchill was
onto something.
Sure, Buckley didn't have all the answers, and he cer-
tainly wasn't always right. But he elevated the national
discourse. Where are his followers? Where are the Repub-
licans who understand that a topic with the life and death
implications of health care reform can't be discussed be-
tween people who don't know the first difference between
fascism and socialism?
Where are the Republicans who don't disdain intel-
lectual excellence, but disdain people who think the word
"elite" is a bad attribute for a politician, but not a Navy
SEAL? Where are the Republicans who are passionate
about their viewpoints, but not crazed? When will this si-
lent majority of the GOP rise up against the latest asinine
coalition of tea bag protesters unwilling to debate specif-
ics, but clinging to vague rumors and hazy ideologies?
Democrats have a person who elevates the national dis-
course. He spoke Wednesday night. It's high time for the
Republicans to find Obama's equal.

Letters to the Editor
Bright Futures should be solely
need- or merit-based
Students should lose scholarship op-
portunities if their parents are successful.
Sure, some of those students deserve
the money, but there are so many more
who need it. Everyone knows need trumps
ability.
So what if the brightest among us
choose to continue their education past an
undergraduate degree?
The debt that they incurred during
their first four years should be embraced
as a social necessity to support their less
gifted brothers.
Those who are less gifted should be
entitled to the same opportunities as the
cream of the crop, without thinking of any
return on investment. Everyone knows it
is righteous to provide for the unearned.
Florida Bright Futures must either be-
come solely need-based or ability-based.
There is no middle ground for it to sur-
vive upon.
If you believe that a family with an
income of $100,000 can support children
through just the first four years of a col-
lege education without taking on any ma-
jor debt, I suggest you try to find such a
household.
Shall we turn another s

Scholarships should be band not need. Need is covered by govern-

If people want scholarships, then they
need to earn them, whether they need
them or not. Bright Futures recipients who
academically deserved Bright Futures
have a right to be upset. They earned that
money.
The students who need more should
really make an effort to work harder dur-
ing high school so that they are awarded
scholarships not only because they need
them, but because they deserve them.
A student with a 4.0 GPA and a 1400
SAT score whose parents make $100,000
a year should receive a scholarship over a
student with a 3.0 and a 1000 SAT whose
parents make $30,000.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be fair to the
student who worked his or her ass off.

rve) have. You can argue that I didn't rightly de-
ased on merit serve my award -although I graduatedin the top 2 percent of my class -and you
can argue that students should have to pay
for classes that they drop.
But my point is that students who have
relied on Bright Futures for the last few
years are being affected by the cuts, and
their collective fiscal plans have been de-
railed. An annual difference of $1,000 may
not seem like a lot, but for a student living
(out of pocket) on $3,000 a year, it's a huge
blow.
So before you tell everyone to stop
whining, consider that we don't all pay
dues to Greek organizations, frequent
Starbucks or hit the bars nightly.
Instead of advocating cutting a pro-
gram that helps educate millions, consider
how it helps many avoid debt while still
fulfilling their dreams and teaching money
management skills that transcend calling
Daddy for more dollars.
The more appropriate resolution for the
program is to raise standards for all levels
of the award, so that only those who really
work for it will benefit.

U ..
Need-based system not an
answer to Bright Futures
While I wholeheartedly agree that the
"woe is me" attitude in response to the
Bright Futures cutback is ridiculous and
just straight-up annoying, a need-based
system is not the answer.
Sure, lots of students of wealthy fami-
lies are receiving aid through Bright Fu-
tures instead of their parents paying their
tuition, but just because a family's income
is $100,000 does not mean the student ever
sees any of that.
My parents make close to that, and yet
I'm working two jobs to pay my own rent
because I've been financially independent
since the age of sixteen.
I don't qualify for any type of need-
based aid because my parents make
enough money to pay my tuition.
Too bad they're not the ones paying it.
Financial need is not always the best
way to determine who deserves a scholar-
ship.
Bright Futures is a merit-based scholar-
ship. It was created to reward students for
their academic achievements. It is a prize,
a privilege, not a right.
Students are supposed to earn this
scholarship, not have it handed to them.
I think the program should maintain its
goal of keeping the brightest students inFlorida by increasing the standards for the
scholarship.
Let's face it: A 970 on the SAT and a
weighted 3.0 are not that hard to come by.
Are those students really the brightest?
Up the ante and reward fewer stu-
dents (the brightest ones who have actu-
ally earned it) to keep the program merit-
based, not need-based.

Protest would drive down
food costs on campus
Students are to blame for the high food
prices on campus.
Yep, that's right. I blame you guys, ev-
ery last one of you who eats on campus.
I know it takes five minutes in the
morning to throw two slices of bread to-
gether with some meat and cheese, but
that five minutes will save you 20 in the
Subway line.
I bring my lunch every day I can. When
they were open, I was a faithful Wendy's
dollar burger patron when I couldn't bring
lunch.
Now that that's gone, I usually starve
until I make my way to an off-campus food
joint with friends, or I just go home.
My father told me a story about when
they raised the price on soda machines
from 50 cents to 75 cents in Kentucky. He
got the students together for a good old-
fashioned boycott.
Within a month, those sodas were back
down to 50 cents and stayed that price for
more than a year.
I've been in silent protest of the food in
the Reitz Union for about a year, but no
more silence. Stop paying for it and the
price will come down.
Better yet, let's just boycott for free re-
fills. I'd pay $20 for a cup I could refill all
semester, because my friends are probably
paying $40 to drink soda.
Add it up for every day you want a soda
-you're usually spending close to $3.
If you drink only 10 days out of the
whole semester, you're already at $30.
Of course, if Aramark didn't own the
university's stomach we could get a Mc-
Donald's and there would be some real
competition. Compare with the 460 calo-
ries McDonald's sells for a buck, along
with free refills.
Now that would be a real accomplish-
ment.

Demonstrators gather to protest Islam on Sept. 11
0 ABOUT 30 PEOPLE
ATTENDED.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
Henrik Boecken is too young to
remember Sept. 11, but he wants ev-
eryone to know what happened the
day that brought America's heart-
beat to a jolting halt.
Boecken, 11, along with 30 other
members of the Dove World Out-
reach Center church, took to the
streets to commemorate Sept. 11
Friday.
Wearing their now-famous "Is-
lam is of the Devil" shirts, the group
lined up along Newberry Road near
the Oaks Mall to voice their position
-that Islam is not a religion of peace
but of violence and aggression.
"Every church should be spread-
ing this message, but they're too
scared to speak out," said Terry
Jones, the church's pastor. "This is
a Christian nation. It needs to stay a
Christian nation."
Jones called Islam a violent and
dangerous religion, citing Sept. 11 as
evidence.
The protest participants ranged
from children whose American flags
dwarfed their bodies to adults. They
waved giant signs proclaiming, "No
to Sharia [Islamic religious] Law,"
"2,993 Murdered" and "Jesus is Nota Liberal."
Many belted out patriotic songs
and religious hymns in cadence to
the sounds of guitars, tambourines
and honking horns.
Jones, whose wife, Sylvia, helped
plan and organize the rally, said their
message is one of love, not hate.
"We don't yell, scream or cuss.
We're not bad people," he said.
"We don't hate Muslims. Jesus loves
Muslims. It's their religion that we
have a problem with."
Boecken said to remain silent on
the issue is unacceptable.
"I don't like to stand back and do
nothing," said Boecken, who came
to the rally with his family. "When
I grow up, I don't want to wear
scarves and be forced to believe in
something that I don't believe."
For the Boecken family, the issue
of whether the church's message
oversteps the boundaries of politi-
cal correctness hit home. Martin and
Andy Boecken, 15 and 17, were sus-
pended for three days from Eastside
High School for wearing the anti-
Islam T-shirts.
"You have kids wearing clothes
with skulls and naked girls, and the
teachers don't say anything. Mean-
while, we wear a shirt that just has
the initials I.I.O.T.D., and we get
sent home for three days; I just don't
get it," Andy Boecken said.
The reaction frompassing drivers
ranged from supportive to furious asJuliana Jimenez / Alligator Staft

Construction on the 24-hour study center will begin in the next fiscal year
STU DY, from page 1
ulus money this year and about the same in
the next fiscal year.
Construction will start sometime in the
next fiscal year, which begins July 2010.
The center will likely encompass 30,000
to 35,000 square feet, he said, and might be
able to fit between 600 and 800 students.
Poppell said the costs will be high be-cause of the restrictions on the project.
"Renovation costs more than building a
new building," he said.
And there's a good chance the building
will be listed in the National Register of
Historic Places, he said, which means the
renovation must keep the original look.
The plan is to keep the building open for
24 hours a day, he said.
Poppell said in order to make this hap-pen, parts of the building might be parti-
tioned to easily shut them down for the
night and allow custodial staff to clean up.
Student Body Presi-
U F dent Jordan Johnson saidAcademics other schools, like the
University of Georgia, al-
ready have popular study centers.
Johnson said he is in favor of the project,
and in the meantime, he would like to seethe Hub extend its hours so students can
study late.
He said if the Student Senate is will-
ing to approve about $25,000 in funding,
the Hub will be open from 8 a.m. to 4 a.m.
every day for the rest of the semester, add-
ing Starbucks has agreed to keep the same
hours as well.
If students like the idea, the new hours
might continue in the spring, he said.

UF swept in top-five showdown
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@alligator org
TAMPA -The Gators learned the hard way how
wide the gap can be between two of the top teams in
the country.
No. 3 Washington dominated No. 4 Florida 3-0
(25-17, 25-10, 25-19) in the Tampa Twice Tournament
at the Sun Dome on Saturday. The Huskies (8-0) have
not dropped a set all season and were nearly flawless
against the outmatched Gators (6-1).
"It's clear that Washington is at a different level
than us right now in the middle of September," UF
coach Mary Wise said. "What makes them so good
-besides how talented they are -is that they make
very few mistakes. You can look at their numbers
all season, and their numbers today reflect that as
well."
Seemingly everything the Gators hit was dug up
by the Huskies -particularly libero Tamari Mi-
yashiro, who had a match-high 20 digs.
Washington's hitters, meanwhile, had their way
at the net, racking up 44 kills with a .359 hitting per-
centage. Florida recorded just 29 kills on .067 hit-
ting.
Up 24-14 in the first set, Washington made its first
attack error of the match. Florida had already com-
mitted seven at that point.
The Huskies' ability to avoid mistakes and cover
the entire floor frustrated the Gators all night, and
UF couldn't create enough of its own points to over-
come Washington's dominant defense and practi-
cally perfect hitting.
"We knew that to beat them, they'd have to help
us, and Washington didn't seem very accommodat-
ing on that front," Wise said.
Although the Gators fought back in the first and
third sets, slowing the Huskies' offensive efficiency
while putting a few points of their own on the board,
the team's defense just couldn't keep up with the
barrage of attacks coming its way.
"They didn't really give us anything," senior
libero Elyse Cusack said. "They didn't give us any
room to get back in it, but that's what great teams do.
That's what we're trying to be."Florida was once again outblocked, seven to four,
despite working on that part of the game all week
in practice. Washington also outdug UF 48-47. Wise
noted both numbers, adding that her team will have
to dig far better in the future unless the blocking
makes the necessary strides.
Senior middle blocker Kristina Johnson offered a
simpler solution when asked what UF can work on
after this weekend.
"Everything. There's room for improvement ev-
erywhere," Johnson said. "We're not perfect, and
we're striving to be a great team."
The Gators were much more impressive Friday
night in the Sun Dome against USF (5-2) in front of
the Bulls' hostile home crowd, winning 3-1 (25-13,
18-25, 25-23, 25-10) behind excellent play by Colleen
Ward and Kristy Jaeckel.
The two sophomore outside hit-
ters combined for 29 kills and 21
digs in the Gators' first match of the
Volleyball tournament. Jaeckel was especially
impressive, finishing second on the
team in kills and recording a .407 hit-
ting percentage.
Despite a mediocre showing against Washington,
Jaeckel was named to the All-Tournament Team.
Wise was pleased with Jaeckel's performance and
the maturity her team displayed by bouncing back
and pulling out a close third set after losing the mo-
mentum during the second set.
In addition to being UF's first loss of the season,
Saturday also marked the end of the team's difficult
early nonconference schedule.
Having already faced three ranked opponents,
the Gators won't play a team nearly as talented as
Washington until the postseason. Aside from Flor-
ida, only one Southeastern Conference team -No.
17 Kentucky -is ranked.
Though the Gators added a loss to their record,
Wise said the rest of the season will reflect whether
or not the Gators made the right decision in opening
the season against tough competition.
"Look around the country and see how few great
matchups on paper there are. I think we could've
easily done that," Wise said. "If we learned from
this, then it will have been worth it."UF sophomore outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel was named to the Tampa
Twice All-Tournament Team.
Kiffin's controversial comments breathe life into once-great rivalry
Hope none of my colleagueswaste any ink writing the
obligatory "The real season
starts now" column this week or
a "Now it's time for Lane Kiffin
to back up his comments" piece.
It doesn't and he can't.
The truth is, Tennessee isn't
very good, and Florida is going
to beat them by as many points
as Urban Meyer deems to be an
appropriate punishment for Kif-
fin's transgressions.
Kiffin first ruffled feathers inGainesville the day he accepted
the UT job.
In his first press conference as
a Volunteer, Kiffin said he looked
to singing Rocky Top after a Ten-
nessee victory against Florida.
Then there was the whole
Nu'Keese Richardson debacle.
Kiffin told fans the day after
National Signing Day that Meyer
violated NCAA rules by calling
Richardson, now a Volunteer,
while he was on an official visit
to UT. Meyer didn't.Mike

mdiferdinando@alligatororgBut re-
ally, I don't
understand
all the Kiffin
hate from
fans. It's like
picking on
your little
brother who
you know
can't fight
back.
I am glad the rivalry of my
childhood finally matters again,though.
Florida-Tennessee used to
be the game of the season in the
Southeastern Conference. It used
to mean something.
There was a time when I could
almost mark the milestones of my
life by UF-UT controversies.
Before the 1991 game, former
Tennessee assistant coach Jack
Sells, who had been fired before
that season for his role in recruit-
ing violations, faxed then-Florida
defensive coordinator Ron Zooka copy of the Volunteers' play-
book. Both Zook and coach Steve
Spurrier denied it, but a Kinko's
employee in Knoxville produced
a fax cover sheet showing a trans-
mission from Sells to a copy cen-
ter at UF. The Gators won 35-18
and the Soviet Union fell some
three months later.

That's more like the Tebow everyone has come to know and love -stiff-

Tebow managed to pass for four TDs in a game for only the second time

Rainey didn't get a carry until midway through the second quarter, but

14 at halftime but scored 48 straight points in
the second half and won 62-37.
When Tennessee was invited to the 1997 Cit-
rus Bowl, Steve Spurrier famously joked, "You
can't spell Citrus without UT."
When the Gators played in the same game
the next year, Volunteers fans hired a plane
to fly over the stadium with a sign that said,
"Tennessee welcomes Florida to the 1998 Citrus
Bowl." I was sitting in the stands.
In 2000, with 14 seconds to go in the game
and UF at the Tennessee 3-yard line, a con-
troversial Jesse Palmer pass to Jabar Gaffney
was ruled a completion and put the Gators up
by three. Gaffney then taunted the Tennessee
crowd with a throat slash and UF won 27-23.
The Gaffney-inspired throat slash became
the Catholic Youth League taunt of choice for
the rest of the season.
In 2004, the year Facebook was created, Dal-
las Baker's head slap of Jonathan Wade cost UF
15 yards of field position that eventually set up
a game-winning 50-yard field goal for Tennes-
see.
I can only imagine that some of the first sta-
tus updates made here at UF involved Baker's
name and a string of expletives.
"Look at the '90s and do your homework on
this thing. Usually the winner of this game was
the team to go to Atlanta," Meyer said. "Obvi-
ously, Georgia really has a say-so in that now.
But the timing of the game and the history of the
game has made this rivalry very significant."
There might not be much drama on the field
this time around, but here's to hoping that Sat-
urday gives us one more thing to talk about
next year.

UF starts homestand 2-0
Quick pace aids attack
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
No. 14 Florida dropped
No. 20 Colorado 3-1 Sunday
in a game more lopsided
than the score indicates.
UF (5-2-0), who defeated
Duke 2-1 on Friday night,
played with conviction from
the kickoff, putting Colorado
(4-3-0 )on its heels with con-
stant pressure.
"When we push the pace,
we're generally a better
team," coach Becky Burleigh
said.
UF's first scoring oppor-
tunity came in the 11th min-
ute when Angela Napolitano
turned on CU defender Kelly
Ross from the left wing.
But instead of shooting,
Napolitano dribbled forward
and tried to set up Lind-
say Thompson for an easier
shot, only to have Thompson
whistled offside.
This surely was trouble-
some for midfielder TahnaiAnnis, who suggested last
week that Florida had been
too hesitant to take shots.
However, UF continued
to control the tempo, and
constant pressure led to a
goal in the 41st minute.
Holly King took a throw-in
from Jazmyne
Avant near the
right touchline
and ripped theSoccer ball into the
upper-left cor-
ner of the net to give Florida
a 1-0 lead.
Any confidence the Buffa-
loes had quickly subsided by
the beginning of the second
half.
On a counterattack in the
48th minute, Erika Tymrak
passed to Brooke Thigpen,
who was streaking near
the left touchline. Thigpen
crossed the ball back to Tym-
rak at the top of the penalty
box, and Tymrak put the ball
right on CU goalkeeper Kara
Linder.Linder appeared to record
the save but then bobbled the
ball and watched helplessly
as it snuck into the back of
the net.
"That's the second time
we've (scored on a mishan-
dled ball) this season. It's
a tribute to our team putting
so much pressure on (the
goalie)," goalkeeper Katie
Fraine said.
A wet ball no doubt con-
tributed to Linder's miscue,
as rain drenched the field in
the first half, and CU's dis-
appointment was palpable
when players hung their
heads.
That could be why Colo-
rado gift-wrapped an easy
opportunity for Thompson
in the 54th minute, when
a Buffaloes player mishit a
header, bouncing the ball
into Colorado territory.
Thompson tracked the
ball down and dribbled un-
marked inside the penalty
box before beating Linder to
the goalkeeper's right from
15 yards out.Tebow ties Williams on TD list

"I'm really looking forward to
embracing some of the great tradi-
tions at the University of Tennes-
see," Kiffin said at a press confer-
ence. "For instance, the Vol Walk,
running through the T, singing
Rocky Top all night long after we
beat Florida next year. It's going to
be a blast so get ready."
If Kiffin has watched any of the
Troy game tape since losing 19-15
to UCLA at home, he knows mak-
ing good on that guarantee will be
no easy task.
The Gators held the Trojans to
139 yards of total offense while
amassing 663 yards of their own -
the second highest total in Meyer's
five years in Gainesville.
Janoris Jenkins, back from sus-
pension, picked off Troy quarter-
back Levi Brown in the second quar-
ter, giving the Gators 14 straight
games with an interception, the
longest streak in the nation.
Meyer and defensive coordina-
tor Charlie Strong figured out a
way to get all three of their safeties
-and arguably their fastest possi-
ble unit -on the field with a blitz-
heavy 3-3-5 defense that wreaked
havoc Saturday.
Sophomore running backs Jeff
Demps and Chris Rainey combined
for 172 rushing yards, Riley Coo-
per and Aaron Hernandez proved
to be reliable receiving targets
and Tebow passed for four touch-downs for the second time in his
career while tying former Auburn
running back Cadillac Williams for
third on the Southeastern Confer-
ence's all-time rushing touchdown
list with his 45th career score.
For the Volunteers to come into
The Swamp and prevent the Gators
from winning a program-best 13th
straight game, Kiffin's squad will
have to be perfect and force Flori-
da into uncharacteristic mistakes,
like the three fumbles lost against
Troy.
"You'll lose
next week if you
turn that ball
overthree times,"
Meyer said after
the game.
Perhaps Ten-
Meyer nessee's best
chance at a win
would have been coming into
Gainesville under the radar and
sneaking out with an unexpected
win the way Auburn and Ole Miss
did the last two seasons.
Unfortunately, Kiffin's brash
offseason comments and bravado
have taken that opportunity away
from the Volunteers, who will un-
doubtedly clash with a highly mo-
tivated Gators team come 3:30 p.m.
Saturday.
"They're posting up all kinds of
Tennessee stuff in the locker room,"
linebacker A.J. Jones said, "so we're
just really motivated to go play
them."
