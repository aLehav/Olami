People brave the rain Wednesday morning and wait in line around the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts to get 
tickets for Bill Nye’s event tonight, hosted by the Accent Speaker’s Bureau.

That girl puckering her lips at her 
phone in class is now validated by Ox-
ford Dictionaries.
The editors of the reference guide 
have revealed their 2013 word of the year: “selﬁ  e.” And, like it or not, many students say they can’t deny the amount 
of face time the word gets. 
Selﬁ  e is deﬁ  ned as “a photograph 
that one has taken of oneself, typically 
one taken with a smartphone or we-bcam and uploaded to a social media website,” according to the Oxford Dic-
tionaries, which added selﬁ  e earlier in 
the year. It beat out words like “twerk,” “binge-watch” and “bitcoin.”
Last year’s Oxford Dictionaries word 
of the year was “GIF.”
Language change such as the accep-
tance of the word selﬁ  e occurs when people need different ways to express new ideas and to help show off their 
social identities, said UF linguistics pro-
fessor Wind Cowels.
He said that type of change has been 
happening since language began. 
“Social media, and the (Internet) 
generally, encourages communication among people who might otherwise have never come into contact, and al-lows us to form, expand and maintain 
social groups in an unprecedented 
way,” Cowels said in an email inter-view. “As a linguist, I ﬁ  nd the language change that emerges from that social in-teraction to be fascinating.”
For many students, the winning 
word doesn’t come as a surprise be-cause in a social-media-driven society, selﬁ  e is thrown around all the time.
Molly Delattre, a 22-year-old UF 
English senior, is not a supporter or participant but still said she ﬁ  nds it ap-propriate the word won the top title.

Bill Nye tickets are bye-bye.
The box ofﬁ  ce of the Phillips Center for 
the Performing Arts, which will host the ‘90s icon at 8 p.m., distributed all 1,550 free tickets within an hour, said Todd Taylor, a 
spokesman for UF Performing Arts.
By 12:50 p.m., all tickets were sold out to 
UF students, leaving none for the public.Taylor said if weather permits, the event 
will be projected on a screen outside. The 
venue has made similar arrangements for past speakers such as Neil deGrasse Tyson.
A few students with tickets have taken 
to the event’s Facebook page and Craigslist to sell them for prices as steep as $100 per ticket.
Accent Speaker’s Bureau chairman Dan-
iel Landesberg said he looked into the Ste-
phen C. O’Connell Center for a larger venue, 
but Nye was only available today, which conﬂ  icts with the Gators basketball game against Middle Tennessee.
“At the end of the day, we can have Bill 
Nye speak to 2,000 students, or we can have Bill Nye not speak at all,” he said.
Devin Holland arrived at the Phillips 
Center after his class ended at 11:30 a.m. and was unable to get a ticket. He said the line for tickets snaked around the building — even in gloomy weather.
“I knew I would be able to get a ticket if 
I skipped class, but I couldn’t afford to skip class,” said the 24-year-old UF electrical en-gineering junior.Bill Nye rules, lines drool: Tickets gone

Homelessness and water protection sur-
faced as recurring themes on Wednesday 
when residents and ofﬁ  cials gathered at the Santa Fe Kirkpatrick Center for the Alachua County legislative delegation hearing.
 Sen. Rob Bradley, Rep. Clovis Watson Jr., 
Rep. Keith Perry and Rep. Elizabeth Porter attended to hear the concerns and issues re-garding Alachua and surrounding counties.
 At the beginning, Perry reminded at-tendees that the lawmakers were not there to act on behalf of a particular group.
 “Our job is to represent you, and I en-
courage you to express concerns as individ-uals or in small groups and make sure you understand our open door policy,” he said. “We represent a large group of constituents and individuals.”
Community members discussed topics 
that included funding requests for UF and Santa Fe College, concerns for local victims of human sex and labor trafﬁ  cking, and local 
support for eliminating the death penalty in Florida.  
A common issue brought up by numer-
ous constituents and ofﬁ  cials was the protec-tion of local water.
 Jean Robinson, a representative from the 
League of Women Voters, said protecting 
local water is of the utmost importance for Floridians.
“Water is Florida’s golden egg,” she said. 
“Let’s not kill that goose.”
Lee Pinkoson, an Alachua County com-
missioner, said that “anything we could do County forum sifts out residents’ concerns

Sustainable UF has challenged Greek Gators 
to cap their water usage.
“It’s a contest where we’re harnessing the 
competitive nature of students to raise their 
awareness of water conservation,” said Stacie 
Greco, water conservation coordinator for the 
Alachua County Environmental Protection De-partment.
The competition is a partnership between 
Alachua County and Sustainable UF, said Lau-rel Nesbit, program assistant for the UF Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability.
Greco said the campaign seeks to emphasize 
to students in fraternities and sororities the con-
nection between their personal water use and 
the effect on the springs they like to frequent. 
Points are earned through two channels — 
the ﬁ  rst being weekly checks of each house’s percentage reduction in water use and the next being weekly challenges. 
The challenges include activities such as 
playing games at the Sustainability Hut, creat-ing banners and attending presentations about 
water conservation.
To participate, the houses must register by 
Dec. 4, said Nesbit, and the contest will take 
place from Jan. 20 until March 2.
Sustainable UF will be distributing shower 
timers to all participating houses, as well as low-ﬂ  ow shower heads to the fraternities, which weren’t involved in the contest last year, and all the sorority houses that did not participate. 
Prizes were donated by Ginnie Springs and 
Blue Springs, said Nesbit, and include dona-tions to philanthropies and ticket packages to the parks.
“Their livelihood is really dependent on how 
well the aquifer is doing,” she said. “They’re very directly impacted by water conservation efforts.”UF Greeks trying

Gainesville to create center for the homeless
for water and bill protection is encour-
aged because water will be a critical issue as we move forward.”
The issue of homelessness in Alachua 
County also surfaced several times.
Randy Wells, a Gainesville city com-
missioner, stood to hold the deed for the Gainesville Correctional Institution, the building they recently acquired to create a center for the homeless. 
Pinkoson said homelessness remains 
an enormous issue. He requested $1 mil-lion to assist in organizing an Empower-ment Center with food, shelter and other resources for the underprivileged. 
“Our No. 1 priority, homelessness, 
is a big issue that’s been languishing for decades,” he said, “and I think we ﬁ  nally have a solution.”
Mayor Ed Braddy touched on the in-
creasing need to re-evaluate the area of “complex” governance of Gainesville Re-gional Utilities.
 “We are beginning discussions to ﬁ  nd 
a voice for the 30 percent of customers who live outside city limits,” he said.

Austin Goldman, a 22-year-old ﬁ  rst-year UF law student, 
said he does use the word, but it’s usually with a sneer.
“It’s a pretty relevant choice,” he said. “If I use the word, 
it’s mostly ironically or jokingly.”
Snapchat, the popular smartphone application used to 
send pictures to other users for mere moments, has made it 
easier than ever to send selﬁ  es to anybody you want.
Samantha Kurzman, a 21-year-old UF public relations 
senior, said it’s commonplace to upload selﬁ  es to various 
online media sites.
“You send pretty pictures of yourself to crushes and also 
really ugly pictures of yourself to best friends,” Kurzman said.
Other students aren’t so welcoming of the movement. Selﬁ  e is technically an abbreviation for the term “self-
portrait,” but that doesn’t mean English speakers are get-ting lazier.
Cowels said new commonly used words show innova-
tion.
“These new words like ‘selﬁ  e’ are not indicators of being 
linguistically lazy,” he said. “Language change is language innovation in the sense that speakers will make new words when they need them for new ideas.”SELFIE , from page 1

� SHE COMPETED IN 
“AMERICA’S NEXT TOP MODEL” TWICE.
ELIZABETH BROWN
Alligator Contributing Writer      
Sleek and confident, Isis King 
was met by loud cheers as the for-
mer “America’s Next Top Model” contestant turned the conference room into a runway.
King, who was the first trans-
gender woman to compete on the show, spoke to about 120 people on Transgender Day of Remembrance and offered her life’s story in en-couragement Wednesday night.
After holding a moment of si-
lence for the transgender commu-nity, she began by showing a clip 
from “Born in the Wrong Body,” 
a 2007 MSNBC documentary that featured her story of transitioning from a male to a female.
King, 28, said 
from a young age, she had an i n d e s c r i b a b l e feeling about her gender.
“I knew I was 
different,” she 
said. “I knew I 
was a little girl.”  
At 21, King said, she began the 
transition process, and in 2008, she became a contestant for the 11th cycle of “America’s Next Top Model.”
“I was completely scared,” she 
said. “So many people said so 
many negative and scary things.”
In 2011, King entered the show 
again for the 17th cycle.
She now works as a freelance 
fashion designer, model and speak-
er and lives in New York City.
“You can’t allow others to dic-
tate who you are or who you are going to be,” she said.
Collin Vernay, the director of 
programming in Pride Student Union’s internal cabinet, said King was given $4,000 to speak.
The 20-year-old UF psychology 
and sociology junior said King’s 
talk was part of Trans* Days, a 
three-day campaign to raise aware-ness and educate students about the community.
Jennifer Heard, a 32-year-old 
UF alumna, said she went to see King because she thinks it is ben-eficial to transgender individuals.
“I think that speaking up and 
showing support for the transgen-der community is important to me,” she said.
King said at the start of the pro-
cess, her family was not support-ive and would not call her by her chosen name. 
But today, she said, her family 
calls her Isis.
“I am not a transgender female,” 
she said. “I’m a woman.”Isis King

Remember in the beginning of “Space Jam” when Mi-
chael Jordan left basketball to follow his father’s steps and play baseball? 
He was terrible at it — in the movie. Michael Jordan, ob-
viously, was meant to play basketball. If the Looney Tunes characters hadn’t abducted him and recruited him to play bas-ketball on their team to avoid being enslaved by Mr. Swack-
hammer, Jordan would’ve continued to strike out in baseball. 
“Space Jam,” aside from bringing us the smash hit song “I 
Believe I Can Fly” and following that weird ‘90s movie trend 
of combining live action with animation, delivered a thought-provoking moral: Stick with what you love. If you’re Michael 
Jordan and you were born to dunk, why in the world would 
you try baseball if you weren’t really that jazzed about it?
Last week, a study conducted by the ACT revealed that 
only about one-third of high school graduates chose a college major that is a good ﬁ  t with their interests. A few factors are at 
play in the rising trend of students opting for majors such as 
engineering or business despite their desire to select a major 
that better ﬁ  ts their skill sets. 
According to the ACT website, “‘It’s important for students 
to have the information they need to make the best decisions 
about their future,’ said Jon Erickson, ACT president of edu-cation and career solutions. ‘They should be made aware that choosing a college major that reﬂ  ects their interests will give them a better chance of succeeding and could also contribute to their satisfaction and happiness in school and on the job.’”
A major is what you make of it. There are ways to be prag-
matic with a degree in liberal arts, communications or ﬁ  ne arts. You’re way more likely to be successful in a ﬁ  eld you’re passionate about, but if you major in business when you’d rather be writing a novel or studying botany, then you’re de-priving the world of the next “Great American Novel” or hy-brid vegetable discovery. 
And in the long run, your degree doesn’t necessarily dictate 
your career. Will Ferrell, after all, majored in sports broadcast-ing. Weird Al majored in architecture, Ashton Kutcher ma-jored in biochemical engineering, and Lil Wayne got a degree in psychology from the University of Phoenix. 
If you choose a major that makes you happy, there’s no 
telling whether you’ll go on to become a beloved comedian or rapper — but busting your butt taking Advanced Calculus won’t get you anywhere. 
The problem with the real world is that Bugs Bunny won’t 
save you from your bad decisions, and R. Kelly isn’t going to score your life. That’s why you need to take charge of your life and choose your paths wisely — and we’re looking at you, high school seniors.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgWednesday’s question: Do you illegally 
download music and/or movies? Today’s question: Does science rule?Panic switch: Recognizing, treating anxiety
It starts in subtle ways: a little shaking, some quick-
ened breathing. No one else will notice, but you know the train has left the station. There’s no way 
to stop it. 
Crippled, weakened and gasping, you’ve become a 
prisoner to your own bedsheets. Pillows become either punching bags or a gag to mufﬂ  e screams. But the worst 
is still coming. 
In a matter of moments, you turn from a human being 
to an infant, incapable of controlling your movement, 
breathing or thoughts. Incomprehensible chaos ensues: thinking of everything at once and nothing at the same 
time while it feels as if you are being ripped apart.
Control of breathing comes back ﬁ  rst, then your heart 
slows, and ﬁ  nally, the shaking ends. As quickly as it 
came, without warning or evidence, it all stops. You’re 
left lying in silence, motionless. It’s almost a slap in the 
face. After that display of unbridled terror, everything goes back to normal. 
That’s a panic attack. Or at least, that’s how I have traditionally experi-
enced them. 
I began having panic attacks in high school — some-
times three in one week. Luckily for me, I had a sup-portive family and friends who encouraged me to get 
treatment. My senior year, I was diagnosed with gener-
alized anxiety disorder.
It took some therapy and a lot of practice to get me 
where I am today, and the journey is still far from over. But now I know how to deal with my illness. Even when 
I know an intense panic attack is coming, I know what 
to do to stop it before it starts. 
If you have anxiety or experience panic attacks, I’m 
writing this for you: You are not alone, and things don’t 
have to be this way.  
In fact, anxiety disorders affect 40 million Americans 
and cost more than $42 billion a year. It can feel isolating, though. 
It’s difﬁ  cult to talk to people 
who seem to not have a care in 
the world when you’re worried 
about stuff you know doesn’t make sense. Every time I walk in a room, I look for every exit 
in case someone becomes the 
next mass shooter. When I walk 
down the street, I constantly watch cars to make sure they aren’t running off the road to hit me. I know my worries are mostly unfounded, but they are relentless.   
Making the effort to feel better is the hardest step, 
but it’s also the ﬁ  rst one. Anxiety is daunting. My mis-take was thinking it was bigger than me. Any progress seemed null when the next panic attack rolled around. 
But nothing is bigger than you. Once you realize that, 
coping with anxiety becomes easier. 
The next biggest problem I had was getting help. 
The isolation that comes with anxious thoughts makes it difﬁ  cult to talk to people about what you’re feeling. 
But everyone understands anxiety. People know what 
it feels like. It’s an emotion. When you talk to people you trust and care about, your words will not fall on deaf ears. 
UF has great resources that help immensely. I went to 
one-on-one counseling at the Counseling and Wellness Center two years ago this semester, and I progressed much faster with guidance than I would have otherwise. Therapy would have been too expensive otherwise, but 
the center offers free help for students. 
Don’t doubt people’s ability and desire to help you.  
More importantly, don’t forget you have that same 
capability.
Don’t be a prisoner of your mind any longer. Justin Jones is a UF journalism senior. His column runs 
on Thursdays.

Some things get better with age: wine, Mustangs, George 
Clooney. But when it comes to the art of picking up women, 
some men just never get the hang of it.
I signed up for Tinder, the superficial hot-or-not app that 
lets you start a conversation upon mutually finding each 
other attractive. Swipe left: Nope, play again. Swipe right: 
Let’s bone.
I left my tagline ambiguous: “Cats, writing and general 
shenanigans,” and I purposely swiped right to every guy Tinder threw my way.
Old guys, young guys, married guys. And in three days, 
I had 905 matches.
Excluding the hundreds of “hey :)” openers, here are the 
best, the worst and the flat-out I-need-a-restraining-order pickup lines by age range. But to be fair, no one turns to a hookup app for love, so cut these fellas some slack.

Attention college slackers, of which 
there are many: There is now a bona 
fide guide on how to live your life to the least potential.
“The Slacker’s Guide to Under-
grad,” written by a “Wise Former Un-dergrad,” features tips on how to get by on minimal effort during college, so you can focus on creating memories with friends and then lose them imme-diately afterward in a drunken haze.
I got the booklet’s author, Rob-
ert Berry, of Clear Lake, Iowa, on the phone to talk about his reasons be-
hind writing a guide for all of the less 
knowledgeable but equally lazy stu-dents out there. 
Berry, a graduate of Creighton 
University, said he wanted to start a business and thought writing a book would be a great idea.
The pamphlet, sold on Amazon and 
Barnes & Noble, tells  about Berry’s ex-periences in college and the tricks he used to live out every slacker’s dream of sleeping in the back of class and still 
passing.
If you are a lazy 
person, and this is 
all starting to sound good, let me stop you here. Though it appears Berry does actually have the credentials of a pro 
slacker, those qualities shine true in this typo-ridden testament to the aca-demic conundrum that is the slacker. Sure, he graduated. 
But should you really be taking ca-
reer advice from someone who is cur-rently unemployed?
I might be a harsh judge of writing, 
but anyone who uses common idioms 
and then misspells them (see: “low and 
behold”) should probably refrain from publishing and trying to sell a book.
In reality, any slacker that has made it into a decent four-year university probably already knows the tricks of the trade – at least any slacker worth 
his or her salt. 
Berry’s advice of looking at lecture 
PowerPoints and checking for easy 
professors on RateMyProfessors.com are fundamental pieces of information just about any student can tell you, and it’s certainly nothing you should pay $2.99 to find out about.
The pamphlet’s final farewell 
should be all the indication a prospec-tive reader needs to realize Berry’s masterpiece of two months’ work is likely an idea he cooked up while en-tertaining the thought, “How do I get other lazy people to pay me money?”
“So in summary I’m glad you have 
read this book, now go put these prin-ciples to use and then with your extra 
free time grab a beer and with your 
buddies cheer to the wise former un-dergrad whose advice you now keep near.”

� THE EXHIBITION DEPICTS THEMES 
OF LONELINESS AND ISOLATION.

Avenue Writer skatona@alligator.org
Dipping his hand into a jar of Vaseline, 
UF art student Zac Thompson covers his 
lanky upper torso as if he were using sun-screen, thick enough to shine in the sun.
For further protection, the 21-year-old 
UF drawing senior wraps his head in plas-tic wrap.
He then takes a white T-shirt and stretch-
es it over his head. He twists his body inside the shirt until he has the position he wants and sits on a foldout chair in his backyard. His head presses against the shirt, casting an expressionless face into the fabric.
A classmate smothers his frozen ﬁ  gure 
with sticky, white plaster. He wears the gunk until the mold is dry enough to take off, grabs another shirt and repeats the pro-cess, contorting into different positions.  
Those plaster molds now accompany his 
work in the the Gallery at the Reitz Union as part of the “Quarantined” exhibit he and two classmates put together. The ex-hibit, which is on the second ﬂ  oor near the 
main stairway, runs through Dec. 5, and 
the opening reception is tonight from 7 to 9 p.m.  
“For me, it’s because I think too much,” 
Thompson said about what makes him want to pull his shirt over his head. “That’s where it came from: things in life being overwhelming where you want to revert back to a day when you were a kid.”
Dounia Bendris, a 21-year-old UF draw-
ing senior, and Hannah Dwyer, a 21-year-old UF printmaking senior, are also featur-ing work in “Quarantined.”  
“We all just kind of make work that is 
based around the idea of isolation,” Dwyer 
said.
The exhibition depicts themes of loneli-
ness, removal from society, uncomfortable 
situations and feeling mind trapped. 
“I see it, instead of keeping something 
in ... as that idea of being isolated or being quarantined in your head,” Bendris said. 
One of her drawings shows a woman sleeping with a breathing mask over her mouth inside a darkened room, something she saw in a dream. She sketched this piece 
ﬁ  rst using charcoal and then used her ﬁ  n-
gers to smudge the thicker, darker lines into shadows. Her ﬁ  ngerprints slide throughout most of her work in the gallery.
All three artists will be at the opening 
reception to talk about their work. Ad-
ditionally, selected works will be for sale 
for those interested in purchasing art. Free food and drinks will be provided by Reitz Union Board Entertainment.
Bendris said outside perspectives are 
important to artists.
“I have in my head what I want people 
to think,” she said. “But I want to hear what they think.”

Dear Mediocre Advice,
I met this guy a month ago, and we click 
on almost every level, and it’s pretty obvi-
ous he likes me… but I’m not sure I can picture myself doing the do with him. Do you think it’s possible to mesh so perfectly with someone that it doesn’t matter you’re 
not 100 percent attracted to them?Dear Friend,
This is every guy’s recurring nightmare — a girl who likes him but does not want to bone 
him. Despite popular belief and my mentality from high school and the majority of college, it’s not always about sex. It’s OK to sleep in the same bed with someone and not end up 
taking your clothes off, no matter how unnatural it feels. To just sit with someone, talk about 
things that don’t matter and not expect to get physical is called a good friendship. Don’t ruin it by forcing yourself to see this person sexually if you don’t have those feelings. Enjoy 
what you have and don’t worry about what you feel is expected of you. You don’t have to 
do anything you don’t want to do.10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 2013

Global retail powerhouse H&M 
debuted its long-awaited collab-
orative collection with high-end de-signer Isabel Marant this past week. Isabel Marant pour H&M was avail-
able for purchase as of Nov. 14 and 
was met with out-the-door lines and a frenzy of online activity that brieﬂ  y shut down the H&M website.
Highly anticipated since its an-
nouncement in June, the collection has generated a massive buzz from bloggers, fashion enthusiasts and bargain hunters alike.
Following in the recent footsteps 
of other retail giants — 3.1 Phillip Lim for Target debuted in Septem-ber — H&M worked with French de-signer Marant to create a collection that echoes the style of her main line but is sold at a lower price point.
The collection reﬂ  ects the eclectic, 
trendy and characteristically French 
style of Marant’s main collection 
with oversized sweaters, ﬁ  tted pants 
and fringed ankle boots.
Gabrielle Piloto, a 19-year-old UF 
telecommunication sophomore and CollegeFashionista.com intern, said 
the H&M collection has some beauti-
ful pieces.
However, with pieces as expen-
sive as $399, she said she also feels the collection doesn’t present many bargains for most shoppers.“Overall, the collection is too 
overpriced for the normal H&M cus-tomer,” Piloto said, “no matter how gorgeous the pieces are.”
Prices aside, designer and mass 
retail collaborations like the Isabel Marant collection have become mas-sively popular in the past few years.
UF marketing 
professor Richard 
Lutz noted the col-
laboration is a type of “co-branding,” aimed at creating an even more ap-pealing product 
for consumers.
“The idea is that … there is a 
strength in both brands, and by com-
bining them, there’s an even stronger 
attraction to the product,” Lutz said.
Despite the appeal and anticipa-
tion of the collection, it seems the Isabel Marant collection will still be slightly out of reach for most student shoppers.
Dani Shapiro, a 26-year-old Cali-
fornia graduate student and style 
blogger at DailyDaniBlog.com, said 
the designer pieces are more acces-sible in theory than in reality.
“Sure, it’s cool that they’re try-
ing to make the brand accessible, but $300 jackets at a fast fashion super-store are hardly accessible,” she said. “People who can’t afford original brand prices still can’t afford those 
prices.”H&M debuts collab

If the public’s relationship with “Doctor 
Who” were a marriage, right now, we would 
be searching all of time and space for the per-
fect gold token to signify our upcoming 50th 
anniversary.
(Also, that would be the weirdest mar-
riage in history, seeing how The Doctor’s face 
changes every few years when he regenerates, 
and there was that 16-year gap when we were separated. But alas, we all know The Doctor would never settle down anyway.)
However, we can call ourselves honorary 
companions and celebrate our devotion to “Doctor Who” by tuning into the much-await-ed anniversary special Saturday.
“The Day of The Doctor” will play on TVs 
and in selected cinemas globally. 
And for those of you who will be in 
Gainesville, you can watch the episode at home on BBC America or get tickets to see it in 3-D at Regal Gainesville Cinema Stadium 14, 
3101 SW 35th Blvd.
“Doctor Who” executive producer Steven 
Moffat has been notoriously tight-lipped about 
his plans for the show. 
But though we may not have a TARDIS, we 
can somewhat see into the show’s future.
We know the approaching special will bring 
together Matt Smith’s youthful Eleventh Doc-tor, David Tennant’s eccentric Tenth Doctor and John Hurt’s gray-haired War Doctor. 
This awkward Doctor-incarnation union is a tradition with “Who” anniversary episodes. And I imagine fans will love to see more of their favorite character in one place. 
“It’s a groovy thing to happen,” Smith told 
TV Guide. “The Doctors are like, ‘You’re the Doctor? You’re not the Doctor!’ It’s funny and ridiculous.”
But the anniversary epi-
sode will not be all fun and 
games. 
The special will answer 
questions we’ve all been ask-
ing since the beginning of 
Smith’s ﬁ  rst appearance.  
From the teasers, we’ve learned the plot 
will span over at least two worlds and three 
time periods, including Elizabethan England, contemporary London and the Doctor’s home 
planet, Gallifrey, during the Last Great Time 
War between the Time Lords and the loath-some Daleks.
To those of you who are friends with 
Whovians but have never seen the show, it may seem like we are speaking a different lan-guage at times: from a police call box that trav-els through time, a screwdriver that is sonic, paper that’s psychic and a doctor who’s not a 
doctor. And our fandom may seem excessive, 
what with the numerous Tumblr blogs, cool bow ties and other Who-related apparel.
But there is a reason the show has stuck 
around for 50 years and survived a 16-year hiatus. 
It’s magical, and I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, if 
you don’t get that.Doctor travels time, space

Put down that smartphone. 
Showing your device too much 
love could lead your partner to inﬁ  delity. 
According to a recent sur-
vey conducted by Victoria Milan, a dating website that provides assistance for people looking to discreetly cheat on their signiﬁ  cant others, 45 per-cent of Victoria Milan users are unfaithful because they feel there is a lack of attention from their partners. 
The survey showed 
that about 50 percent of  people on the web-site shared the feeling of having an unatten-tive partner. 
Among the 6,000 
Victoria Milan users that participated in the survey, 
about 60 percent were male, 
and about 70 percent of all par-ticipants indicated they would not be unfaithful at all without the help of technology.
In an email interview, 
Aishah Vassallo, the public re-lations manager of Victoria Mi-lan, said paying more attention 
to a device than a partner can 
weaken relationships, “which can lead us many times to look at what is missing in our rela-tionship,” she said. 
“At the same time, the use 
of portable devices and web-sites like VM can make cheat-ing more discreet and easier than before.”However, some UF stu-
dents and professors are du-bious about the merits of the survey. Laurie Mintz, a UF 
psychology professor special-
izing in sexual health and be-havior, said the results of the survey cannot be generalized to the public outside of the website’s users.
“All we know, then, is that 
for people [that] are already using technology to help them 
cheat on their partners, smart-
phone use may also contribute 
to the problem of cheating,” 
she said.
While many stu-
dents agree that cheat-ing is an extreme reac-tion, some think the problem applies to dif-
ferent demographics.
“I feel like it’s more 
a problem with older 
married couples because when 
you’re our age, you usually haven’t been with someone long enough to know every-thing about them so you focus on them more,” said Vivek 
Kumar, an 18-year-old UF ﬁ  -
nance sophomore. “Still, if I had this problem, it wouldn’t urge me to cheat.”
However, Alex Borkholder, 
a 19-year-old UF political sci-ence sophomore, disagrees.
“I see a lot of college-aged 
couples out and on their phone instead of communi-cating with each other,” he said. “You don’t ﬁ  x problems 
by cheating. You talk to your 
partner.”Stay off your phone or

To The Girl With The Beautiful Blue Eyes
                        and Little Blue Eyes:
 
This will be the first Homecoming and Growl 
in 10 years, that we are not able to go.  Little 
Blue Eyes, however, will be there.  The three 
of us were together in Gainesville last week 
and we had a great time.  
 
Homecoming is very special to us.  It marks 
the beginning 33 years ago, and it makes 
me sad to not be there together.  During this 
time, I know how lucky I am to have both of 
you in my life.  I could not make it without the 
love and support of both of you, my wife and 
daughter.  I love you both so much.  Next 
year, when Little Blue Eyes will be a "Super 
Senior", we'll make it the best ever.
 
                              ILY,
                                     Liarface

At 6-foot-8, Dorian Finney-Smith 
is a sight to see when he brings the 
ball up the court. 
With Kasey Hill out for a month 
with a high left ankle sprain and Scot-tie Wilbekin still suspended, coach Billy Donovan said he is confident 
in his newest big man handling the 
ball during No. 16 Florida’s matchup against Middle Tennessee tonight at 7:30 in the O’Connell Center.
Finney-Smith, who was suspend-
ed for UF’s first two games, returned to the court against Arkansas-Little Rock and helped the team’s scoring in the paint and rebounding. 
In two games, Finney-Smith has 
averaged 12.5 points and eight re-bounds. 
After going 4 of 7 from behind the 
arc, the Virginia Tech transfer is also 
Florida’s most efficient three-point 
shooter.
Although Florida has already in-
creased its average points by 11.5 per game and rebounds by 10 per game 
with Finney-Smith back on the floor, 
Donovan has to utilize all of the red-shirt sophomore’s skill sets because of a limited lineup.
“The pressure that you’re reliev-
ing is most teams are going to play with pretty much two primary back-court players,” Donovan said. 
“So, if [Finney-Smith] is playing 
the power-forward spot, and he’s bringing the ball up the floor and he’s initiating the offense, a lot of times it’s going to be against a power 
forward. So, it’s a little bit differ-
ent sometimes. So, I think we can, based on lineups, move and shuffle 
people around in different positions 
based on mismatches in certain situ-ations.”
Finney-Smith has experience tak-ing the ball up the court. Although 
he never played point guard in his 
one year with Virginia Tech, he said he played the position in high school

Seven starters from a year ago are not the only 
thing gone from the Gators’ defense this season. 
The unit’s ability to create turnovers has also 
seemingly vanished. 
“That’s something we’ve talked about a lot,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “We’ve gone through 
and tried to emphasize to our players some oppor-tunities that they had to strip the ball, to take the ball away.”
Florida has failed to create many turnovers this 
season. 
Through 10 games, the Gators have forced six 
fumbles and intercepted nine passes; their total of 15 takeaways is tied for 83rd in the nation and tied for ninth in the Southeastern Conference.
Juxtapose that against the 
30 turnovers the defense cre-ated last season, and it’s no surprise the team’s overall 
turnover margin has dipped from plus-15 a year ago to minus-3. 
“When I was at Texas, we had a guy named Earl 
Thomas, who had 10 or 11 interceptions and four or five caused fumbles,” Muschamp said. “The next year we weren’t as good in turnovers [because] Earl Thomas wasn’t there.”
Florida has experienced similar upheaval among 
the players who consistently created turnovers last season. Matt Elam and Jon Bostic — two players who left the Gators for the NFL — totaled eight takeaways a year ago. 
“You’ve got to develop in that role a little bit,” 
Muschamp said. “We’ve got to take advantage of those opportunities.”
Florida’s offense has experienced similar regres-
sion.
After finishing last season with 15 turnovers, 
the Gators have already coughed up the football 18 times this season. 
“We know how critical it is to our success,” de-
fensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. 
“We’ve got to protect the ball and get the ball out 
on defense. Obviously, we’re not winning in that Florida failing to 
create turnovers

Florida freshman Alex Holston has al-
ready earned her spot in the Gators’ start-
ing lineup. 
But after Wednesday night’s three-set 
victory against Tennessee, Holston proved she is ready to assume Chloe Mann’s role when Mann graduates after the season.
Florida swept Tennessee (25-18, 25-21, 
25-17) in Knoxville, Tenn. on Wednesday night. 
“We would call that a great bounce-
back match,” coach Mary Wise said in a postgame radio interview.
Holston had 13 of Florida’s 47 kills, which led the team.
 She was also efficient, 
recording no attack or service errors and notch-ing a hitting percentage of .684. 
“Alex showed terrific 
patience,” Wise said. “Recently she’s been a little early. To-
day she showed more patience and great 
range.”  
But Mann is not gone yet. She made 
10 kills with an uncharacteristically high 
number of errors, lowering her hitting per-centage to .300. Freshman right-side hitter powers Gators to sweep of VolunteersSee noteS, p Age 16See hoopS, p Age 16

“The pressure that you’re 
relieving is most teams are 
going to play with pretty 
much two primary backcourt 
players.”

 on Scottie Wilbekin, who remains suspended
UF Fo otball“They have her down for 
four errors … I think all four 
of those were missed tim-
ing,” Wise said. “I think for 
Chloe, she was very inten-tional.”
Sophomore outside hitter 
Gabby Mallette was the only player to record a block in the ﬁ  rst set. Her solo block was one of Florida’s (25-3, 14-2 Southeastern Confer-
ence) two individual blocks 
— the other coming from sophomore outside hitter Ziva Recek. 
The Gators recorded 
four team blocks, while the Volunteers (9-20, 1-14 SEC) made no individual blocks and only one team block. 
“There’s deﬁ  nitely some 
blocks we missed,” Wise said. 
“It’s a place where we’ve 
showed signs of being solid. We understand that’s not the make of this team. We’re not going to lead the country in blocking, but we do think 
there are more blocks to be 
had.”
The Gators trailed during the second set until tying the score at 20. From there, Flor-ida took the lead and held onto it until the end. 
“Tennessee was playing 
well, and I think we got into 
that, ‘This should be a little 
bit easier,’ as opposed to em-bracing it, ‘OK, they’re play-ing better. Let’s go,’” Wise 
said. 
“We just needed to get 
into another gear.”
Wednesday’s win marks 
Florida’s 25th of the season and the 23rd consecutive 
season in which the Gators have won 25 or more match-es — the longest streak in the 
NCAA. 
The Gators return to the 
O’Connell Center for their ﬁ  -
nal home match of the regu-lar season.
Florida hosts LSU on Fri-

Murphy remains question-
able: After sitting out of Florida’s 
19-14 loss to then-No. 10 South 
Carolina on Saturday, quarter-
back Tyler Murphy remains ques-tionable to play against Georgia Southern this weekend. 
Muschamp said Murphy at-
tempted to throw during practice Tuesday, but discomfort stem-
ming from his sprained throwing 
shoulder remains. 
“It’s all about his discomfort 
level right now, and it’s gotten better every day,” Muschamp 
said. “If you look from Sunday 
to today, it’s much, much, much improved. We’ll just to continue 
to work through that.”
Skyler Mornhinweg, who 
completed 10 of 13 passes for 
107 yards with an interception in place of Murphy against the 
Gamecocks, continues to take 
ﬁ  rst-team snaps in practice. 
“If we had to play today, Sky-
ler would start and be ready to go in the game,” Muschamp said. 
Injuries: Florida’s patchwork 
offensive line will continue to 
lack one of its critical pieces this 
week. 
Left tackle D.J. Humphries, 
who suffered a sprained MCL about a month ago, was ruled 
out for the game. Muschamp said Humphries tried to partici-
pate in practice but does not have 
enough strength in his knee. 
Muschamp also ruled out 
Marcus Roberson (ankle) for Sat-urday’s game. Roberson, a junior 
cornerback, has not played since Nov. 2. 
He was suspended for Flori-
da’s game against South Carolina but would not have been healthy enough to play regardless.

Finney-Smith to assume ball-handling duties in Hill’s absence
and in AAU.
As a junior at Portsmouth (Va.) I.C. 
Norcom High, Finney-Smith averaged six 
assists per game. Hill is the only Gator to 
collect six assists in a single game this sea-son.
“I’m pretty conﬁ  dent in my ball-han-
dling, so I think if coach needs me to play point, I’ll do it,” Finney-Smith said.Donovan will not have to pressure his 
forward to handle the ball the entire game. 
With DeVon Walker, Michael Frazier 
and Casey Prather able to bring the ball up the ﬂ  oor, the Gators will employ a commu-nity effort at point guard until either Hill 
or Wilbekin returns.
“We have enough ball-handling to initi-
ate our offense,” Donovan said. “I think if 
we are dealing with any kind of pressure, 
hopefully utilize it as a chance to open up the ﬂ  oor and play fast. But certainly, we’ll 
have to take care of the basketball and 
make good decisions.”
Although Florida currently ranks 116th 
in the nation with a 1.2 assist-to-turnover ratio, Will Yeguete said Finney-Smith’s versatility and ability to handle the ball 
will help limit the Gators’ turnovers even without a true point guard active on the roster.
“You guys saw it at the end of the game 
when he was handling the ball,” Yeguete said. “He can pass it. He can shoot. He’s got size and can rebound. 
“I think he’s going to be able to help us 
now with Kasey being out.”HOOPS , from page 15Rachel Crosby / Alligator Staff
