  UF political parties are taking the campaign for Stu-
dent Government seats online this semester.
  The Students Party and the Unite Party are gearing up 
for the senate and executive elections on Feb. 21 and Feb. 
22 and upping their online campaigning.
  The Unite Party debuted a new website and is using 
Facebook to interact with students.
  A question posted on the party’s page asked what stu-
dents wanted to see changed on campus. Students said they did not want a tuition increase, and they also voted 
for a Chick-ﬁ  l-a with a breakfast menu at the Reitz Union 
and integration of ISIS, e-Learning and Webmail.
  Party members will post videos to the Facebook page, 
said party spokeswoman Christina Bonarrigo.
  The Students Party will also be shifting its campaign 
toward the Web. 
  The party will put up tables with laptops to encourage 
students to post ideas on its Facebook page, Sen. Carly Wilson said. 
  The tables will be set up Wednesday and Thursday on 
Turlington Plaza and at the Reitz Union from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Unite Party will still have a board for platform ideas at Turlington and the North Lawn on Tuesday.
  Wilson said her party wants people who wouldn’t 
walk through those areas to be able to participate. 
  “We encourage students wherever they are to post 
ideas on the wall,” Wilson said. 
  Not every idea necessarily goes on the party platforms, 
though.
  “We use the most frequent ones and the ones we feel 
can be accomplished,” Bonarrigo said.  SG parties taking student ideas

  Visitors of the Pride Community Cen-
ter of North Central Florida have been fre-
quently towed recently.
  Co-president of the center Terry Flem-
ing said Scott Espenship, who co-owns 
Sun Crest Ofﬁ  ce Complex where the center 
is located, has had 13 visitors’ cars towed 
during the past month. 
  Fleming is ﬁ  ling a complaint with the 
city, calling the towing an “act of discrimi-nation.”
  The center’s visitors sometimes park in 
spots reserved for neighboring businesses, he said.
  While the landlord has speciﬁ  ed certain 
parking spaces for individual businesses, he said the parking lot was designated so anyone could park anywhere.
  Documents on the Alachua County 
Property Appraiser website did not specify 
parking regulations for the lot. 
  Fleming said he ap-
proached Mayor Craig 
Lowe because people 
visiting other busi-
nesses who park in the wrong spots don’t get towed.   
  Lowe referred the issue to the city’s 
equal opportunity director and the city manager.
  Espenship declined to comment. 
  Ron Chambers LLC is listed as the com-
pany that owns the property, according to 
the Alachua County Property Appraiser website. Ron Chambers, owner of the com-pany, said Espenship is a co-owner of the 
complex. He said he would not discuss 
business about the complex because he does not oversee it.
  Neighboring business owner Dawn Xe-
nakis, who owns A Southern Elegance Sa-lon, said Espenship is simply doing his job to ensure everyone has equal parking.
  Fleming said he was unfairly targeting 
one organization.
  “This is blatant discrimination,” Flem-
ing said. “He should be monitoring all visi-tors to the property, not just ours.”  Group accuses 
business of bias in towing
CRIME

  Gainesville police foiled a burglary 
attempt Sunday afternoon when the al-
leged criminal left behind a distinct clue: 
a business card.
  Jason C. Johnson, 41, walked door-to-
door on Northwest 13th Avenue, telling 
anyone who would listen that he could 
trim their trees. 
When he knocked at 906 NW 13th 
Ave., nobody answered, but something 
caught his eye. Johnson walked to the screened-in pa-
tio on the side of the house, picked up a queen-size bed frame and lugged it to his truck, which read “Gainesville Tree 
Service” on the back. 
The owner of the house, Aowyn 
Plants, watched Johnson through a win-
dow, according to an arrest report.
  Plants called 911 and, after some help 
from neighbors, Johnson was lured back to 13th Avenue and arrested. He was charged with petit theft and burglary of an occupied dwelling.
  Prior to the arrest, ofﬁ  cer Michael Preston asked around to see if any-one else on the street saw a man from Gainesville Tree Service. To his luck, several people talked to Johnson. He 
even left behind his contact information, 
according to police.
  Preston called Johnson. He wanted 
an estimate on the tree service, he said. 
When Johnson came back, Preston ar-
rested him.
  Johnson admitted to stealing the bed 
frame, according to police, but he could not be reached for comment Monday.  Tree trimmer charged with theft, burglary

The Alachua County Humane Society is get-
ting closer to its goal of zero euthanasia by the 
end of 2015. 
The facility quadrupled in size over the last 
year to make adoption more efficient.  
In 2011, Alachua County Animal Services euth-
anized about 2,500 animals. In 2000, that number 
was closer to 8,000, said Eric Van Ness, executive 
director of Alachua County Humane Society.
“We made progress, but there is still a while to 
go,” Van Ness said.
Veterinary technician Zach Toundas said the 
center receives about seven animals each week.
“Dogs go fast, but adult cats go slow,” Toundas 
said.
Though it is independent, ACHS works with 
other animal rescue centers in Alachua County .  
There isn’t any competition among them, Van 
Ness said. The centers work together toward the same goal.  
While adoption has become more efficient be-
cause of a bigger facility, problems with funding and volunteers present obstacles to eliminating euthanasia. 
After quadrupling in size, ACHS cut half its 
staff because of lack of funding, Toundas said.  
Without funding, volunteers or both, Van Ness said if none of the partner rescue groups can take animals in, Animal Services will be forced to eu-
thanize because there is no room.
ACHS classifies animals in different categories 
of health: healthy, treatable re-habitable, treatable-
manageable and unhealthy-untreatable, Van Ness 
said.
“Healthy is a narrow definition,” he said.
Ear mites, for example, are considered treat-
able re-habitable, he said.  
“There have been animals that were eutha-
nized which were treatable re-habitable because 
there wasn’t enough room,” he said.  
Alachua County Animal Services takes strays 
and abused pets, creating a constant influx of pets that need adopting, he said. ACHS takes some of them and places them for adoption. 
Operation Catnip, a nonprofit organization 
that works out of ACHS’s facility, helps with the 
overpopulation of stray cats.  
Van Ness said the organization sterilizes cats 
and puts them back in the community .  
The cats also get a microchip before being re-
leased.Animal rescue facility reduces

A former UF football player was 
arrested for simple battery Sunday 
morning.
Steven R. Wilks, 23, punched An-
drew O’Such in the UF Plaza parking 
lot at 2:05 a.m. after O’Such tried to break up a fight in which Wilks was involved.
O’Such was at Relish when he 
looked through the windows and saw Wilks pummel O’Such’s roommate, Terrell Martin.
He said he doesn’t know why 
Wilks hit Martin or why the two were even outside together. But the fight was one-sided.
O’Such said Wilks floored Martin 
with one punch. When Martin tried to get up, Wilks decked him again. Mar -
tin tried to get up again, and again Wilks punched him.
O’Such ran outside, hoping to stop 
Wilks.
“He was going crazy ,” O’Such said. 
“I tried to calm him down, but there was no getting through to him.”
A large crowd gathered around 
the parking lot, and O’Such noticed 
former UF wide receiver Riley Cooper 
watching. Cooper, who now plays for the Philadelphia Eagles, hosted an on-line quiz show with Wilks last spring.When O’Such stepped between 
Wilks and Martin, Wilks punched him in the left eye. The area around the eye is swollen, bruised and cut, according to an arrest report.
O’Such works with kids at a lo-
cal community center, and he said he 
wore sunglasses all day Monday so 
they wouldn’t see the injury.
“It’s all purple; it looks like [Ninja 
Turtle] Donatello without the mask,” he said. “It’s not a good look.”
Wilks, who played fullback at 
UF from 2007-10, is listed at 6-foot-1, 
235 pounds on the 
Gators’ official 
website. O’Such 
said he is 5 feet 9 inches, 150 pounds.
“I had no idea 
who he was,” O’Such said. “I thought he was just some random, 
pissed-off big dude.”
After punching O’Such, Wilks 
walked away, but he was arrested next to the parking lot about 20 minutes later. He told police the fight started when an unknown man punched him.
Wilks graduated from UF in De-
cember. He did not return a message seeking comment Monday . Alum charged with battery

The African American Account-
ability Alliance endorsed Lauren Poe 
in the Gainesville City Commission runoff race after a forum Monday.
Organization members said they 
felt Poe was the best candidate to bring jobs to Gainesville and fulfill the promise of Plan East Gainesville.
Gainesville residents listened to 
Lauren Poe and Nathan Skop, the runoff candidates for the at-large 1 seat, vie for the alliance’s support at the forum.
“East Gainesville has potential,” 
Poe said.
The number of people who live in 
the area and the transportation ser -
vices make the east side of Gainesville valuable.
Poe said there is too much red tape 
in the way of developing Gainesville further.
“It was tough to be a public servant 
and a teacher during [an economic re-cession],” Poe said. “It was tough for everyone.”Skop said he doesn’t agree with 
Poe’s ideas about how to operate city 
finances.
“We have all been the victim of 
Poe-enomics,” Skop said, referencing 
his opponent’s term on the City Com-mission.
Julian Kinsey , 20-year-old Santa 
Fe elementary education sophomore, said the atmosphere of the forum was open and encouraged active govern-
ment participation.
“I really like the 
forum because you get to dig into what the candidates are saying,” said Kin-sey, a former stu-dent of Poe’s.
Kinsey said the 
organization is a 
voice for east Gainesville.
With the organization’s support, 
Poe will receive a check and cam-paign help.
“The endorsement is really going 
to affect how voters in east Gainesville are going to make their decision,” he said.At-large 1 candidates vie

Most of the former at-large 1 candidates for the Gainesville 
City Commission race have decided to support runoff candi-
date Nathan Skop in the runoff race — leaving little support for his opponent, former City Commissioner Lauren Poe.
Dejeon Cain, Richard Selwach, Darlene Pifalo and Mark 
Venzke — who were defeated in the Jan. 31 City Commis -
sion race — have given their support to Nathan Skop for the Feb. 28 runoff. James Ingle is undecided. Donna Lutz could not be reached for comment.
The former candidates ran on platforms of changing 
the current City Commission, instituting change in east Gainesville and creating change in the city’s economic sta-tus.Poe earned 4,411 votes and Skop earned 4,955 votes, com-
ing in first and second, respectively, in the race. No candi-date earned a majority of the votes, so the race will go to a runoff on Feb. 28.
Those who support Skop said they particularly like his 
stances on important city issues such as job creation.
“We need a new direction, and I believe it can begin with 
Skop,” said Dejeon Cain, a former at-large 1 candidate. “He can bring experience.”
Cain said Skop will bring insight gained from dealing 
with governmental agencies.
“We can’t go in the same direction, like we would with 
Lauren Poe,” he said. “The path is contaminated.”
Richard Selwach, a former at-large 1 candidate, will be 
publicly supporting Skop around town and has already do-nated to his campaign.Darlene Pifalo, a former at-large 1 candidate, said she 
wants more information on how each candidate plans to deal with the biomass plant project.
Skop has already publicly said the biomass situation 
needs to be fixed, she said, and Poe is proud of his stance on moving forward with the biomass plant.
Some former candidates are less sure of their choice.Mark Venzke, a former at-large 1 candidate, said he has 
some reasons to be uncomfortable with Skop but more rea-sons to wary of Poe.
He said he has asked several times for Skop and Poe to 
produce documentation proving their views and numbers, especially regarding a city biomass contract.
One former candidate hasn’t decided whom to support.James Ingle, a former at-large 1 candidate, said he will sit 
down with both runoff candidates in the next week.Former commission candidates endorse Skop for runoff election
� UF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH 
CENTER RECEIVED $3.5M GRANT.
CLARE LENNON
Alligator Staff Writer
UF’s Transportation Research Center re-
ceived a $3.5 million grant for an initiative 
to improve transportation in the Southeast United States.
The U.S. Department of Transportation 
awarded the grant to UF in January after the university led a team of schools in submit-ting a proposal for the project.
This led to the new Southeastern Trans-
portation Research, Innovation, Devel-opment and Education Center at UF, or STRIDE. Seven other schools are collabo-rating with UF: Auburn University, Florida International University , Georgia Institute 
of Technology , Mississippi State University , 
North Carolina State University , University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of North Carolina.
Ines Aviles-Spadoni works at the TRC 
within UF’s College of Engineering and will serve as the STRIDE coordinator.
She said the initiative will focus on mak-ing transportation more economically com-petitive, easier for local communities and safer for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians.
The grant will provide more funding 
for graduate and undergraduate student research in transportation, said director of the TRC and civil engineering professor Lily Elefteriadou.
This is the second grant UF has received 
from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Elefteriadou said. In 2007, the department gave $1 million, which was matched by an-
other $1 million, primarily from the Florida 
Department of Transportation.
This year’s grant requires that it be 
matched by a maximum of $3.5 million from nonfederal agencies. It also must be used for research, education and workforce devel-opment, and STRIDE must make the find-ings easily available through outlets such as workshops and classes.
Southeastern transportation needs must 
be evaluated and reformed on a broad scale, Aviles-Spadoni said, from emergency evac-uation procedures to air-quality concerns in local communities.
“We hope that by coordination with 
these universities that we will address all those critical needs,” she said.Grant to improve transportationskop

A Santa Fe College student was 
charged with animal cruelty, domestic 
battery and false imprisonment after try-
ing to smother a cat and then trapping 
his girlfriend in a bathroom on Sunday, according to Gainesville Police.
Marvelle S. Rucker, 21, told officers 
he tried to kill his girlfriend’s cat after it caused him to fail an online exam. 
Rucker said he held a pillow over the 
cat and punched it.
Rucker and Tiffany R. Gammon live 
together at The District on 62nd apart-ment complex, located at 1000 SW 62nd Blvd. 
They have been dating for more than a 
year, according to police.
When Gammon arrived home from work around 4:50 p.m. Sunday, she found her cat to be lethargic and unresponsive.
Rucker cornered her in the bathroom, 
yelled at her and continually poked her 
in the face. 
Rucker stood over Gammon and 
yelled at her for about 
15 minutes, according to police.
Gammon finally es-
caped after another roommate stepped in.
Rucker told police 
he wasn’t going to let Gammon leave the 
bathroom until he told her what he want-ed to say. He also admitted to poking her in the face and said he didn’t know that 
was a crime.

Abidah Ali’s friends recognize her by her shoes.
The black-and-gold Pumas peek out from under 
the clothes that cover most of the 20-year-old soci-
ology junior’s body. She wears a floor-length abaya 
robe and a hijab head scarf, signs of her Islamic re-ligion.
Before the current president of Islam On Campus 
moved to Gainesville, she was afraid she’d be a tar -
get of prejudice.
To change biased perceptions, the organization 
is putting on Islam Awareness Month during Feb-ruary. Members hope to work with individuals to 
change the broad perception of Islam, Ali said. 
She found that her religion wasn’t really an issue 
at UF but said she feels the 9/11 terrorist attacks 
changed the general American population’s view of 
Muslims.
UF assistant professor of Arabic Sarra Tlili said 
she agrees that Gainesville is relatively accepting 
because the university allows people to be more educated on religion. 
Student Government funds Islam Awareness 
Month, which costs about $21,000, Ali said. She ex-pects about 200 people at each event.
Three main events showcase the fundamentals of Islam. Each event is color-coded to coordinate with the theme, “Colors of Islam.”
The first event is Islam 101, a forum on Thursday 
for people to ask questions about the religion.
A Monday lecture titled Me, Myself & God ex-
plains what is asked of a Muslim in a relationship with God, Ali said. 
The third lecture on Feb. 23 will consider how 
Muslims view Muhammad.
Other events include a “Malcolm X” screening, 
a Henna tattoo booth at the Reitz Union’s Gator 
Nights and a Jewish-Muslim comedy show co-spon-
sored by UF Hillel and the Jewish Student Union. 
Ali said she hopes to make a difference at UF 
through Islam Awareness Month.
“If by having these events one non-Muslim can 
understand Islam better and respect Muslims bet-ter and respect the faith better, then that means I’ve succeeded as a president,” she said. Islam events intended to change biases

A man wearing a stock-
ing cap and blue latex gloves 
robbed a Checkers at gunpoint early Monday morning.
According to Gainesville 
Police, a black male entered the restaurant, located at 912 W University Ave., from the rear entrance at about 3:30 a.m. brandishing a firearm. 
Police described him as be-
tween 5-foot-8 and 5-foot-10, 30 to 40-years-old and weighing between 180 and 200 pounds.
According to a Checkers employee, the suspect stole the night’s deposit — about $800 to $1,000 — and fled east. The employee, who declined to 
provide a name due to compa-
ny policy, said three employ-
ees were working the night of the robbery.
The employee said the 
combination to the safe was 
changed, among other safety 
precautions, and that the em-ployees handed over the mon-ey without incident.
“I’m sorry,” the employee 
said, “there’s nothing in this store that’s worth your life.”

about the robbery can call

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Are you planning on suggesting   
platform ideas to student government parties?
96 TOTAL VOTES67% YES
33% NOMonday’s question: Did you watch the Super Bowl?  Tragedy should signal better safety measures
  Waking up Sunday morning two weekends ago, I booted up my Internet browser to check on the news, politics and my guilty pleasure of celeb-
rity scandal.
  On the Hufﬁ  ngton Post newsfeed, a blue underlined 
hypertext read the following: “Florida Pileup Kills At Least 10.”
  After what I thought would be a quick perusal, I real-
ized this pileup didn’t happen in just any city in Florida. It happened in Gainesville, just a few miles south of a city I have come to call home.
  Eleven people perished on Interstate 75 near Paynes 
Prairie Preserve State Park, several of whom called Gainesville home as well. Among those was a Santa Fe College student and single mother whose passion was dancing.
  The names and stories of those who perished extend-
ed from local to national headlines, and within hours Gainesville rose in the eyes of the nation from the quint-essential college town to one that was grieving over a major loss of life.
  On a weekend that was marked with two popular 
events, the local Hoggestowne Medieval Faire and near-by Gasparilla Pirate Festival in Tampa, many woke up to the solemn news: A forest ﬁ  re and already foggy con-ditions made for poor visibility along the highway at 4 a.m, and a domino effect of deadly automobile crashes ensued.
  But while the city mourned over its losses, the town 
stood guard, ready to deal with the tragedy.
  Shands at UF went live at 5 a.m. that Sunday, bringing 
in medical experts and extra staff to tend to those in criti-cal condition. As always, Shands didn’t fail in offering superb medical attention.
  The Hilton University of Florida Conference Center 
Gainesville took in those who had been stranded for hours on the interstate, offering rooms for the night free of charge. The Hilton’s gesture alleviated much of the stress the city already had to deal with.
  As of today, the ﬁ  re that be-
gan the early-morning tragedy remains unexplained. It is possi-ble that the ﬁ  re was man-made.
  Whether the ﬁ  re was started 
accidentally or by an arsonist, investigations must be made to 
prevent such a tragedy from occurring again.
  Gov. Rick Scott rightfully ordered an investigation of 
the Florida Highway Patrol. Opening the highway back up was a bad judgment call on the FHP’s part. If the FHP was present clearing up an accident earlier that night, why wouldn’t it leave the road closed after seeing the fog conditions?
  While whoever is at fault should be punished, wheth-
er it be an arsonist or those who prematurely opened the highway, measurements should be enacted to keep the roads safe for all who come to and from Gainesville.
  FHP should also play an active role in discouraging 
travel during the late-night hours. Past midnight, driv-ing on the roads becomes a serious danger. A driver not only has to deal with dim lighting and the battle of fall-ing asleep at the wheel, but also with the possibility of drunk drivers.
  Thousands of passengers, both from the university 
and those just passing by, travel down I-75 each day.
  Gainesville cannot afford another heart-wrenching 
tragedy, so I urge the FHP to crack down on enforcement and safety measures on our roads. But as far as dealing with the tragedy goes, the city has done a tremendous job in maintaining the reputation of a caring town. 
Safe travels.  Colleen Wright is a journalism freshman at UF. Her col-

Senate candidate 
wrong for racist ad
  We have all heard the platitude that China owns us. As 
of November 2011, according to the treasury depart-
ment, foreign governments held $4.75 trillion of U.S. 
debt. China owned $1.13 trillion, or 23.8 percent, of all foreign holders of U.S. debt. 
  That’s a large sum of money that has many on both sides of 
the aisle worried about our growing dependence on China as a 
primary lender. 
  It’s also an especially popular campaign strategy for one side 
to blame the other for increasing the debt and subsequently giv-ing China more power. Many candidates for federal ofﬁ  ce have 
used this as a talking point in ads around the country . 
  Pete Hoekstra, who is running for U.S. Senate, is another one 
of those candidates. 
  Hoekstra’s opponent is Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., 
whose last name Hoekstra has cleverly changed to “Spend-it-now.”
  In a recent ad, which ran during the Super Bowl, Hoekstra 
tried to tie Stabenow’s record of increased spending to the issue of Chinese ownership of our debt. 
  For a state like Michigan, with an unemployment rate above 
the national average at 9.8 percent, hearing that more jobs could be outsourced to China as a result of its growing economy 
sounds like an effective strategy . 
  Well, unless you’re Hoekstra.   The 30-second spot begins with a pan of what looks like a 
rice paddy ﬁ  eld with gongs and Asian instruments in the back-ground. Then, what has to be an Asian-American girl in a yellow shirt (yes, really) rides up on her bike to the camera, stops and 
says the following with an American accent: 
  “Thank you, Michigan Senator Debbie Spend-it-now. Debbie 
spend so much American money, you borrow more and more 
from us. Your economy get very weak. Ours get very good. We 
take your jobs. Thank you, Debbie Spend-it-now [sic].” 
  Where to begin?   
  Often, people have a tendency to cry racism when things 
are taken out of context or if they are trying to belittle their op-ponents. But there is absolutely nothing you can say to make it 
seem like this ad was not being overtly racist. 
  The girl, who is probably not even Chinese and most likely 
an American, is riding a bike through a stereotypical rice paddy . 
If you are trying to create an image that jobs are being shipped 
overseas, what in the hell does a rice paddy have to do with any-
thing? 
  You could show images of a thriving city in China or Chinese 
workers in a factory or anything but this. Fire your campaign 
manager for making an ineffective advertisement if you wish to 
pretend that this ad wasn’t racist. 
  These sort of idiotic stereotypes play to the lowest common 
denominator and really do nothing more than make you look like an imbecile.

Seventy-four Egyptians were killed dur -
ing a soccer match in Cairo on Feb. 1. 
The beaten and trampled victims suf-
fered stab wounds, suffocation and severe 
head trauma. The immediate cause of the brawl is uncertain, but it was likely motivat-
ed by team rivalry. 
Video depicts players sprinting to the 
locker rooms as hundreds of people storm 
the field. Armored policemen stand around dimly unsure of their duties. One-sided 
fights — one or two men surrounded by a mob — begin on the field and in the stands. 
Police fire tear gas at the rioters from a safe distance.
In a country that has come so far but still 
has so far to go, it’s devastating that such ef-
fort would be wasted on petty murders and 
misdirected violence. What might this riot 
reveal about a latent state of our own soci-
ety?
Three factors catalyzed this outbreak of 
violence.
Egypt’s society is unsettled. Political strife 
and disorder persist. The Egyptian post-rev-olution elections left new leaders in office and citizens with contempt for authority. Unrest and economic uncertainty have bred 
disdain in the protestors and citizens whose 
sacrifices now seem ineffective.
Egyptian society is polarized and, for 
many, its opposition’s visions are too threat-ening to its own. Islamist groups, such as the 
Al-Nour Party, oppose many of the youth 
who call for personal liberty and voice. Mili-
tary infidelity tightens the tension between 
extremes.
These same factors lie dormant within our 
own society. The Internet has spiked aware-
ness of political misconduct and corruption. 
In a single day, millions of citizens voiced 
their opposition to SOPA/PIPA — bills that threatened the First Amendment. 
In the wake of the economic crisis, much 
of this insight comes as a bitter beacon of in-
equality. It unsettles Americans to learn that 
the front-running Republican contender, 
whose wife held $3 million in a secret Swiss bank account and jokes about being “unem-
ployed,” pays a tax rate that is half that of 
most Americans’.
Volatile contempt brews within our so-ciety; occasional protests emerge 
through tea par -
ty and Occupy 
movements. These movements reveal 
the polarization of our own society. 
At face-value, the movements are 
distinct, antithetical even. Yet their demands 
derive from the same desire for a voice.
Society as a whole becomes more polar -
ized as citizens exclusively subscribe to cer -
tain networks, outlets and ideologies. Yet with blatant ethnocentrism, some dismiss 
the Egyptian tragedy as an outcrop of a vio-
lent Arab disposition.
With our pious consumption of violent 
sports, movies and video games, Westerners 
are hardly less inclined to violence. The fact that our system still wobbles on its unsure 
foundation is all that keeps us from simi-
lar outbursts. It is baseless and blind to see 
American disposition as passive. The vio-
lence seen on any given night out is enough to make this apparent. We have our own rev-olution, but it is more mental than political. 
The public is becoming more conscious and 
assuming responsibility for action.
And though this revolution does not 
bring the same strain and strife as a political overhaul, it reveals a latent discontent for our 
system. If this discontent goes unchecked, 
misdirected violence will begin to plague 
our society. We may find ourselves similarly 
affected by petty assaults.
With acute foresight we can resist this vio-
lence. 
The deaths in Cairo are not merely an in-
dication of Arab disorder but an indication of a growing global disorder. We must embrace 
the principles of solidarity toward each oth-
er, accountability toward ourselves and civil 
disobedience toward corruption. We must 
plan for a future in which these principles 
are upheld, and we must direct ourselves 
peacefully with reference to the present.
Misdirected violence abroad should cau-
tion us from misdirected violence at home.

Vice President Joe Biden visited Florida State University 
on Monday to talk about rising college costs and the various efforts the Obama administration is undertak-
ing to tackle them.  
During Biden’s visit, a student asked him if increasing 
government aid and subsidies have been contributing to the increasing tuition costs  Biden was speaking about. The vice president’s response was in the affirmative: Government med-dling in the funding of students’ college education has led to increased tuition.
It’s an inescapable effect of government meddling in the free 
market. We’ve seen it happen with the housing market. 
The dream of owning a home is exploited by the govern-
ment through laws and regulations that are enacted to encour -
age home ownership among those who desire a home of their own but cannot afford it. Home values rise and the need for financing increases. 
What happens? The system crashes. Taxpayers are left to carry the costs and the economy suf-fers. The fact is that the current avail-ability of financial aid should be a cause for concern in that it appears to be the same game with different players.
Students have the dream of a college education. Parents 
can’t afford to help and students cannot find work to pay for the tuition. So the government enacts laws and regulations that provide funding for subsidies and guarantees loans to individ-uals regardless of which school they attend, what their major is and whether or not, in the future, they will have the ability to pay off the loan. Tuition costs rise and the need for aid in-creases. What happens then? The system will crash. Taxpayers will be left to carry the cost and the economy suffers.
The reality is that responsibility is lacking on the part of both 
the government and the student. The government is too bulky and awkward to evaluate every loan application and survey the feasibility of investing in an individual’s education. Indi-vidual students fail to evaluate the benefits of an education at a particular institution and enroll at schools where tuition ex-ceeds the value of career opportunities that await graduates. Students graduate with overpriced degrees that they will not be able to pay off.  This is similar to homeowners who buy ex-pensive homes with loans they will be unable to pay off  just for the societal status.
The problem lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of the 
American dream. Owning a home is not the American dream. Earning a college education is not the American dream. The dream is the pursuit of one’s goals and the pursuit of happi-ness. Rather than an equal outcome, it means an equal oppor -
tunity to rise above one’s background toward a quality of life that one’s ancestors could only dream of. 
That’s the dream. You have not failed if you do not own a 
home. You have not failed if you don’t have a college education. You only fail when you give up on pursuing your dreams.

Speaking OutThe phone number provided in the arrest report 
was disconnected.
Katherine Hanea, who lives two doors down 
from Plants, said she met Johnson on Sunday morning. He kept his distance and wasn’t too chatty.
“He couldn’t have stayed for longer than a 
minute,” she said. “He was real brief: in and out.”
The owner of Gainesville Tree Service, Butch 
Holton, said he hired Johnson about three weeks 
ago.
“He’s probably not employed anymore,” Hol-
ton said Monday.
Johnson was arrested and charged with do-
mestic battery in 2006, according to the Alachua County Clerk of Court website. Holton said he did 
not know about Johnson’s prior arrest before hir -
ing him.
“I don’t go on the Internet and dig that up,” 
he said. “I talk to people eye-to-eye. The majority of the people in the tree-trimming business aren’t Ph.D.s. Most are kind of on the bottom.”innovation hub

When former Student Body 
President Jordan Johnson left UF 
in 2010, he was on a track to be-come the CEO of a General Electric Co. business. 
He was working in a rotational 
program, and every six months GE would send movers to his house, pack up all his stuff and give him a ticket to someplace new. He went to New York, Connecticut and Washington, D.C. 
Johnson learned to work 
through convoluted business breakdowns and figured out a so-lution. 
“It made me sharper,” he said. But Johnson left his GE work 
behind in December. 
“I could come back to Gainesville 
and build a dream,” he said. 
So he co-founded Totuit with 
Ray Land, the owner of Fabulous Coach Lines. Totuit is located in 
the Innovation Hub and creates 
mobile applications for the trans-portation industry.  
Totuit is in the process of devel-
oping two applications. 
Cartuit will give people the abil-
ity to summon a ride by dropping a pin on the map at any location.
“It’s automatic, it’s seamless 
and, frankly, it just makes sense,” Johnson said. The other application, called 
To by Totuit, is for transportation companies. It’s an intelligence dashboard with Google maps, a chat system, drivers log and trip status. Johnson said the idea of Totuit 
is to take the paper-run industry and turn it into the technology of tomorrow. 
“There’s a reason why we came 
back and started a development company for the transportation in-dustry, and that’s because we feel like we can win,” he said. 
Johnson graduated in 2009 with 
a degree in economics. After he won the Student Body presidency, he continued his schooling at UF and graduated with a master’s in management in 2010. He was the first president to run with the Unite Party. 
David Kratzer, interim associ -
ate vice president of student af-fairs, has known Johnson since he was an undergraduate student. He said Johnson is focused, positive and self-assured. He also said he thought Johnson would stay with GE. 
“Here he is, walking away from 
the dream career to take a chance 
and be an entrepreneur,” he said. 
The Innovation Hub is designed 
for startup companies just like his, 
Kratzer said. 
City and university officials 
want to turn Gainesville into a place where students can stay and be successful, Johnson said. 
“And to me, that’s what 
Gainesville is: It’s a place where I 
can come back and be successful,” 
he said. “And I can be successful at making a difference.”Former SG president returns to Gainesville an entrepreneur8, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2012

BEHIND HILLEL.

Roadwork for a through street near UF will affect the daily 
commute of about 100 residents and thousands of drivers once 
construction starts this summer.
The plan to resurface the road along Northwest 22nd Street 
and Northwest Fifth Avenue will go before the Gainesville 
City Commission on March 1. 
The initial plan for the construction project was submitted 
last week.
The project will involve replacing the curbs and gutters, re-
surfacing the asphalt and widening the sidewalks.
Stefan Broadus, the project’s manager and an engineer for the City of Gainesville Public Works Department, said his goal 
is to finish the project before the home football game against Louisiana State University on Oct. 6. If the contracted construc-
tion company doesn’t finish the project before football season, 
it won’t be allowed to work during home game weekends.
Although the final cost of the project won’t be settled until 
a construction contractor is chosen through a competitive bid-ding process, the budget is about $1 million, he said.
The project will span Northwest 22nd Street between Uni-
versity Avenue and Northwest Eighth Avenue and Northwest Fifth Avenue between Northwest 22nd Street and Northwest 20th Street, according to the city manager’s biweekly report.
With so many potholes in the asphault, there is rarely a 
smooth patch of road for more than 5 feet, said Monica Petrel-la, a 20-year-old UF food and resource economics sophomore.
The construction is scheduled to start in the summer be-
cause “the traffic drops significantly once the semester ends,” Broadus said.Roadwork near campus to begin in summer

About 50 employers will attend the 
11th annual College of Agricultural 
and Life Sciences Career Expo.
The expo will run from 9 a.m. to 3 
p.m. Wednesday in the Reitz Union 
Grand Ballroom.
Charlotte Emerson, director of stu-
dent development and recruitment for 
CALS, said this year’s event will bring employers such as Bayer CropScience, Syngenta, The Walt Disney Company and some government agencies.
Emerson said she expects about 500 students to attend.
Although many students leave the 
event with internships and jobs, Em-
erson said students 
who aren’t looking for jobs can still ben-
efit from the expo.
“The earlier they 
have the opportu-
nity to practice com-munications with a potential employer, I think the better they 
will be in the long run,” she said.
If you attend the fair, Emerson said, 
dress professionally, bring a resume and, most important, know about the companies you’re interested in.
Entomology and nematology senior 
Andrew Shahan, 23, attended his first CALS Career Expo in 2011. 
He said it had a much more person-
al feel than other career fairs. 
“I was surprised by how friendly 
the employers were,” he said. 
Shahan said students should attend 
the event early on in college. It gives students “face time” with job recruit-
ers, he said. “They can see how you 
handle yourself.”
Emerson recognized students have 
insecurities about the future.
However, she said, “There are jobs 
out there for our students, and that is probably the biggest misconception.” College of Agriculture to host career fair this week

Gainesville is changing, and 
its residents had a chance to voice 
their opinions on changes they 
would like to see more of at the 
Focus on the Future community forum on Monday night.
About 40 Gainesville residents 
and officials gathered at Cone Park to give city officials feed-back on what they would like the city to look like in the future. 
Focus on the Future was de-
signed to help city officials pri-oritize their focus on issues resi-dents said were problems in the community.
“What we’re really looking 
for are ideas,” said Mayor Craig Lowe. “We never know what ideas citizens may bring forward that will solve a problem that we 
have in the city.” 
The forum was structured 
around six roundtable discus-
sions: economic development; 
transportation and transit; future 
growth and the environment; customer service; public safety and parks; and recreation and culture. 
“I think one-on-one conver -
sation is always the best,” Lowe said. “Small group meetings are good to have a constructive con-
versation about the real issues 
that the city faces.”Residents chose which discus-
sions to join. After 30 minutes, 
everyone switched categories.
The City Commission pro-vided members of the different 
categories with a set of questions 
meant to stimulate discussions 
and appointed a speaker who reported the findings to city of-ficials. 
Each resident had the chance 
to speak out about the issues they were passionate about.
Residents said they want fast-
er response times from police and from city officials. They also want city employees to follow up on work orders such as neighbor -
hood road maintenance the same 
day residents place the orders.
City Manager Russ Blackburn 
said information gathered from residents will be used in planning 
the city’s budget for the 2013-14 fiscal year and in the five-year capital improvement plan.
Residents said they were 
pleased with the forum.
“I think it is time for city of-
ficials to prioritize on the issues,” said Gainesville resident Caleb 
Young. “We should have more of 
these meetings to get the issues to the power and get the commu-nity involved.” TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 9

Beal Honored Again
Gators guard Brad Beal was named the SEC’s 
Freshman of the Week on Monday, marking the ﬁ  fth time he has won the award this season.  Follow Tuesday
For live tweets and analysis from tonight’s game, make sure to follow @GregLuca and @JJBoothe.Aundre Larrow / Alligator
Freshman guard Brad Beal said Florida will not be able to drive the basket easily against Kentucky, which features top shot-blocker Anthony Davis. Davis leads the country with 116 rejections; as a team, the Gators have 81. 
� NO. 7 UF PLAYS NO. 1 UK TONIGHT AT 
7 IN RUPP ARENA. THE GAME WILL BE SHOWN ON ESPN.

 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Last Thursday, with less than four minutes 
to play, Brad Beal was in mid-air above the rim 
and about to exact a small piece of revenge on 
South Carolina’s Damontre Harris.
  Earlier in Florida’s 74-66 win, the 6-foot-9 
Gamecocks starting forward sent back six Gators 
shots, including a layup of Beal’s. 
But this time, Beal had a step on his defend-
er.
  As he continued to elevate from the baseline, 
Beal’s right arm cocked back and then sent for-ward the ball cradled in his hand. Harris, clearly, 
wasn’t going to touch this one.  
  It was the kind of dunk that ended up putting 
the 6-foot-3 freshman guard on national TV .
  Heading into Rupp Arena tonight at 7, 
though, that’s the same kind of play Beal doesn’t 
expect No. 8 Florida (19-4, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) to be making when it takes on top-ranked Kentucky (23-1, 9-0 SEC) for a share of ﬁ  rst place in the league standings.
  “It’s probably going to be impossible for us 
to get all the way to the rim, just because they have (Terrence) Jones and Anthony Davis down there,” Beal said.  “Both are great shot block-
ers.”

  After being involved in a scooter accident Friday, Florida at-
tacker Ashley Bruns will play in this weekend’s season opener. 
The situation is not as clear for Colby Rhea. 
  Bruns is expected to be in the lineup when Florida plays 
North Carolina on Saturday in Chapel Hill, N.C., but coach 
Amanda O’Leary said Rhea will miss the game due to an un-
disclosed injury that occurred prior to Friday’s accident. There 
is no timetable for Rhea’s return.
O’Leary conﬁ  rmed Monday that Rhea suffered severe facial injuries that required stitches after the scooter Rhea and Bruns 
were riding crashed into a car near the en-
trance to The Estates apartment complex 
Friday . 
  “I’m just happy they were wearing hel-
mets,” O’Leary said. 
  O’Leary said Rhea sustained the facial 
injuries despite the fact that she and Bruns 
were wearing helmets when the accident oc-
curred. O’Leary said she makes all players wear helmets if they choose to ride scooters. 
“Obviously now, looking back it was a good idea,” she said.
  After a number of players were involved in scooter acci-
dents at the beginning of the Summer B semester, Florida soc-
cer coach Becky Burleigh instituted a rule requiring all players 
to wear helmets when driving scooters.
  O’Leary said she had Burleigh’s rule in mind when making 
the same decision last month. In addition to requiring all driv-ers to wear helmets, any lacrosse player riding a scooter as a passenger must also be wearing a helmet. 
  “There have been some incidents with athletes and scoot-
ers,” O’Leary said. “Looking across the board, it just made  Bruns to play against North Carolina; Rhea out indeﬁ  nitely   Florida’s best chance of upsetting 
Kentucky lies not with Kenny 
Boynton, Brad Beal or even Pat-
ric Young, but with one of the Wild-cats. 
  His name is Marquis Teague, and 
he isn’t your average John Calipari 
point guard. Of course, that’s partly 
because the average Calipari point guard is otherworldly. 
  Teague is following in the foot-
steps of Brandon Knight, John Wall, 
Tyreke Evans and Derrick Rose, but at this point in 
his career, he 
has nothing on 
those NBA tal-
ents. 
  In fact, he’ll 
be the worst starter on the ﬂ  oor Tues-day night. 
  The best way for Florida to fell the 
mighty beast that is Kentucky is to 
hack off its head, and that means pres-
suring the turnover-prone Teague into mistakes. 
  UF proved how important turn-
overs were in Saturday’s win against 
Vanderbilt, when 17 takeaways 
sparked numerous Gators runs and took the Commodores out of rhythm. 
  That’s a model UF desperately Pressuring

(on top-ranked Kentucky)
sense. It’s a helmet. It’s not that big 
of a deal.”
Gators basketball player Wal-
ter Pitchford and baseball player Casey Turgeon have suffered mi-
nor injuries in scooter accidents in 
the past six months.
For the lacrosse team, O’Leary 
took measures to ensure her play-ers’ feet were protected as well. She put a rule in place requiring players riding on scooters to wear closed-toe shoes.
“They’ll put their feet down to 
stop … if they drag their toes and are in flip flops or whatever, then their skin flies off,” O’Leary said.
Last season, Bruns was the 
Gators’ second-leading scorer with 46 goals and led the team with 28 assists. The junior attacker also 
earned first-team all-conference 
honors in 2011.
Rhea started in 13 games for the 
Gators in 2011, scoring 15 goals and recording three assists. The junior midfielder also missed Florida’s exhibition opener against England with the prior undisclosed injury . 
Several freshmen will help re-
place Rhea’s production while she is out. Freshmen midfielders Nicole Graziano and Nora Barry saw time against England and combined for six goals. O’Leary also said fresh-man midfielder Shannon Gilroy , who missed the England game with a knee injury , will be back for the North Carolina game. TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 15
needs to follow against Kentucky, a team that will 
hold almost every conceivable advantage. 
The Wildcats have won 48 in a row at fabled Rupp 
Arena, where 23,500 fans will try to make life miser -
able for the Gators. 
Kentucky will have a decided edge in athleti-
cism, including six players who entered as five-star 
recruits. 
The Wildcats figure to control the paint, as the 
team leads the nation in block percentage and two-
point field-goal-percentage defense thanks to mon-sters like Anthony Davis and Terrence Jones. 
Their seventh man, Kyle Wiltjer, would have a le-
gitimate chance to start at Florida. 
But if UK has a weakness — a legitimate “if” for 
the No. 1 team in the nation — it’s turnovers. And 
Teague is the main culprit. 
The dominant Wildcats haven’t lost since Dec. 
10, but the closest they came was a three-point win 
against Tennessee on Jan. 14, when Teague turned it over five times. 
His turnover rate for the season is 25.6 percent, 
more than five percentage points higher than anyone else who will play in Tuesday’s game. 
UF coach Billy Donovan is usually hesitant to go 
to full-court pressure on the road, given the lack of crowd support and officials’ tendencies to give the home team preferential treatment. 
But on Tuesday, Donovan has to throw caution to, 
and run like, the wind. 
On the surface, it seems like a bad idea to speed up 
a Kentucky team with so many athletes. But during the course of the year, the Wildcats’ offense has actu-ally been worse in games with a higher tempo. 
The most possessions UK played in a game was 
78 against fast-paced Louisville when the Wildcats 
scored a season-worst 0.88 points per possession. 
And given Kentucky’s propensity to pound it in-
side, this game could very easily be one where Young 
and Erik Murphy get into foul trouble. That scenario 
would mean greater minutes for Will Yeguete and 
Casey Prather, two players best suited to bring the heat at the top of a press.
Pushing the tempo gives Teague and the Wildcats 
more chances to make a mistake, something UF will 
desperately need if it hopes to knock off heavily fa-
vored Kentucky.

Sophomore center Patric Young played just 14 minutes 
against Vanderbilt after getting into early foul trouble. 
LAcrosse,
 from page 14O’Leary set 
rules for 
protectionDavis presents post challenge for Young
Harris, the SEC’s fourth-leading shot 
blocker, Kentucky’s big men present a much taller challenge. 
The 6-foot-10 Davis, a freshman, 
has 116 rejected shots — the most in the nation. 
Florida has 81 as a team.
Gators coach Billy Donovan said 
the best way to negate Davis and 
Jones, who has 42 blocks, is to make good decisions and not risk floating shots in the lane. 
“It can’t be a situation where we’re 
not going to go to the basket or not post up because [Davis is] there,” Donovan said. “I just think you have 
to make wise choices, because when 
he does block shots, it certainly ig-nites them on a fast break, and they’re traditionally a terrific transition, fast-breaking team.”
With 6-foot-11 junior Erik Murphy 
being more of an outside-shooting threat and fellow forward Will Yeg-uete making most of his plays on 
defense, the only other Gators player 
with a better penchant than Beal for finishing at the rim is center Patric Young. 
A 6-foot-9 junior, Young has a 
team-high 34 dunks, but he is also struggling to find his way back to form after injuring his right ankle in early January.
Though he made his return to the 
starting lineup for the first time in five games Saturday against Vanderbilt, 
Young got into foul trouble early and 
played just 14 minutes. His lone field goal came off an uncontested dunk. 
Donovan said Young may still be 
feeling the effects of the injury, even if it’s just on his conditioning. 
“When he’s got that energy going 
and when he’s got that motor going and he’s somewhat rested, he’s re-ally effective,” Donovan said. “I think his inefficiency maybe the last couple games has had to do with he has not played with that motor. He’s got to mentally push through that fatigue.”
Beal said he doesn’t think Young is 
frustrated. 
“He’s probably going through 
the same thing that I probably went through, so to speak,” Beal said. “I 
think he’s fine mentally. He just has to 
get back into his flow, and I think he’ll be alright.”
Regardless of if they are able to get 
Young comfortable and scoring points again in the paint, junior guard Kenny Boynton said the Gators will have to 
shoot at a high percentage from the 
3-point line to keep Kentucky off-balance. 
“Three-point shooting will be a fac-
tor in the game,” Boynton said. “An-
thony Davis is a great shot blocker 
down there, so they’re going to try to run us off the line. We just got to ad-just to whatever defense they play.”

Azania Stewart needed to shake up 
her season.
Watching tip-off from the bench for 
the first time Jan. 12, Stewart had mini-
mal statistical impact in a 61-55 loss to then-No. 19 Georgia.
The 6-foot-4 senior played just 17 
minutes, scoring two points and fail-ing to grab a rebound in Florida’s third Southeastern Conference loss in four games.
Except for junior forward Jennifer 
George — the team’s leading scorer and rebounder — the Gators were lack-ing offensive punch in the frontcourt.
However, Stewart reversed her for -
tunes in the paint just one week later in a 61-37 win against Alabama.
George led all post players with 15 
points and 12 rebounds against the Crimson Tide, but Stewart was the 
breakout performer, scoring eight and 
grabbing 10 boards.
“We really had a double threat on 
the low block,” coach Amanda Butler 
said. “It’s crucial to being a great team 
in this league. You’ve got to control the paint.”
Since defeating Alabama, Stewart 
has posted some of her best numbers 
this season.
In the last five games, she is aver -
aging 9.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per 
game, which best her season numbers 
of 5.2 points and 5.3 boards.
Most impressive have been her 
back-to-back contests with double-digit 
points, scoring 12 on LSU and a season-high 14 against Ole Miss.
Although UF is only 3-2 during 
that stretch, Stewart has played well enough on an individual basis to rejoin the starting five.
Stewart says the method behind her increased output of late has been an in-
creased focus on accomplishing more 
in practice.
“I’m having great practices, not even 
just on the offensive (end), but just be-
ing more vocal with what I do in prac-
tice,” Stewart said. “Preparing even for practice like I prepare for games, just trying to transfer that over.”
Butler has not noticed much differ -
ence in Stewart’s routine during the week except for the center’s mindset. Stewart is doing a better job of main-taining the momentum she builds up 
in workouts throughout the week and 
into games, Butler said.
“Azania just really took to heart 
needing to play better on the offensive end,” Butler said. “(She’s) just really 
preparing better, mentally maybe more 
so than anything.”
Leading up to the Jan. 29 game 
against Arkansas, Butler emphasized the need for Florida’s five seniors to 
“take over this season.”
Facing a deficit of 4.5 games to No. 
7 Kentucky in the conference standings 
with six left to play, UF is on the verge 
of being eliminated from the race.
However, with Stewart and fellow 
seniors Ndidi Madu and Lanita Bartley trending upward right now, the Gators 
can use their experience to make a run at a higher seed in the SEC Tournament, 
which begins March 1.
“There’s just things that happen in 
your senior year that are just things you 
feel,” Butler said. “Just a heightened sense of awareness of that clock is tick-
ing on your college career.”
