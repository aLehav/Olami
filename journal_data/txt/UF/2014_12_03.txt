Henna is used as decorative body art, but to 
Jeena Kar, it is a way to heal people. 
Kar, 21, makes her own organic henna to cre-
ate designs for patients going through cancer 
treatments.
The UF religion senior drives to Orlando 
to share her artwork with patients at a private 
practice.
“I really felt like, for the ﬁ  rst time, I found 
a way for me to give meaning to my art,” she 
said. 
Kar said her Indian roots have played an 
important part in her integration of henna and medical treatment.
At the private practice in Orlando, she has 
painted henna for about 20 patients on their 
arms and created crowns on their heads free of 
charge for women who have lost their hair due to chemotherapy.
Kar said she wanted to emphasize that bald 
is beautiful by applying the henna to increase 
women patients’ self-esteem.
“(Women) really lose their dignity when they 
lose their hair. It’s such a big part of who we are, 
so I started the henna crowns,” she said.
Kar has painted crowns for two women, one 
of whom is a close friend of Dr. Mary Rockwood 
Lane, an associate professor in the UF College 
of Nursing.
Lane said her friend was excited when she 
heard about Kar’s henna designs.
“She’s able to have this beautiful painting on 
her head, and she is able to maintain her incred-ible beauty,” Lane said. 
Kar said a patient told her she felt conﬁ  dent 
and beautiful for the ﬁ  rst time since losing her 
hair after receiving a crown.
“When I ﬁ  nished it, I walked her to the mir-
ror, and when she saw it, she said, ‘This is beau-
tiful. I feel beautiful,’ and she started crying, Henna lifts cancer patients’ spirits

Santa Fe College student senators 
will present an amendment today 
that could allow administration to 
remove active Student Government 
members without trial.
The amendment states that, in 
the event that a member is removed 
from SG by administration, “there 
will be no need for an impeachment or any other removal procedures.”
Should the amendment pass, 
Santa Fe’s Student Life, Student Af-
fairs and any other branch with the 
authority to punish the conduct of students will be responsible for re-
moving SG members from ofﬁ  ce.
The amendment comes nearly a 
month after a verbal dispute broke 
out between Student Senate Presi-dent Jeremy Pierce and Student 
Body President Michael Chartier 
following an internal investigation into claims that Pierce threatened a senator.
On Nov. 19, student senators 
failed to reach a conclusion on im-peaching Pierce. 
Connor Levine, the 19-year-old 
SFC nursing sophomore who wrote 
the amendment, said in order to im-
peach a SG member, he or she must either fail to perform a legally re-quired act, commit a wrongdoing or violate the Senate constitution.
Student senators will again ad-
dress Pierce’s possible impeachment today, but the senate president said he is not concerned.
“I feel just as conﬁ  dent today as I 
have in previous days,” Pierce said.SFC Student

Past accomplishments and future plans 
were discussed at the Student Govern-
ment’s State of the Campus Address on 
Tuesday night.
UF Student Body President Cory Yeffet 
started his address with one of the biggest 
issues SG has worked on throughout the 
year: sexual assault.
“Sexual assault is a growing issue, 
especially among college campuses,” he said.
SG launched a weeklong sexual as-
sault awareness campaign to promote 
education about sexual assault and help prevent it.
Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol 
vans were doubled from four to eight and 
an escort service called Walk Safe was cre-
ated to ensure student safety, Yeffet said. 
About 2,000 teal ribbons were also tied 
around trees during the week.
Afterward, Yeffet praised the success 
of advocacy efforts between UF Student Senate and Gainesville city commission-ers.
During a Senate meeting held at UF 
Hillel on Nov. 18, city commissioners discussed issues students face living in Gainesville, including towing, lighting and apartment leases.
Yeffet said the commissioners were 
made aware of these issues and are work-ing to provide more lighting off campus, hold towing companies accountable to State of the Campus Address sums up year SEE HENNA, PAGE 4

Students for a Democratic Society 
to hold demilitarization pro-testThe tragedy and backlash in Ferguson, Missouri, has cata-
pulted the increasing militari-
zation of America’s police into the minds of the people. How can a local police force look like an invading army? The answer: The federal 1033 pro-gram, where the government provides excess military-grade weapons and supplies to local 
and college police departments 
— all at no external cost. As stu-dents at a peaceful public insti-tution of learning, we know it is unacceptable for our campus police to be participating in a program that provides free grenade launchers, APC trucks and assault rifles. Join Students 
for a Democratic Society at 
1:40 p.m. today as we rally on Turlington Plaza and bring our demands forward to UF ad-ministration. Opt out now!

This weekend, downtown 
Gainesville will be ﬁ  lled with locally 
crafted artwork, stained glass, sculp-tures, jewelry and prints. 
The Hippodrome State Theatre 
is teaming up with the Gainesville Fine Arts Association for the week-end, which will have more than 90 pieces of local art for sale. 
Local artists will display their 
pieces during the Hipp Holiday Artwalk on Friday at the Hippo-drome Art Gallery from 7 to 10 p.m. The theater is also hosting the Hipp 
Holiday Art Market Saturday from 
noon to 4 p.m. 
Some artists include Chris Tat-
um, who specializes in woodwork, Diana Tonnessen, who specializes in colored linoleum block prints, and Marilyn Gray, who specializes in calligraphy and watercolors.
The art walk on Friday will also 
feature live music from Rafael Ri-era, a Florida State Music Teacher Association concerto competition winner.  
Hippodrome actress Nichole 
Hamilton, who has starred in local productions, such as “A Christmas Carol” and “Dracula,” will be paint-ing patrons’ faces. The Hippodrome bar will also serve holiday drinks. 
The art market Saturday will pair 
the gallery with a variety of family-
friendly activities, including an ap-pearance by Santa Claus from noon 
to 1 p.m., a kids craft table and live music from Simone, an 8-year-old 
violinist who won the Longleaf Pine Youth Fiddle Contest last year.
“She is an amazing violinist, and 
she knows how to work a crowd,” said Meg Westermann-Clark, the Hippodrome’s director of public 
programs. 
Westermann-Clark said she ex-
pects a couple of hundred people at the event and more than a  thousand people at the gallery throughout the holiday season.
“It gives people an opportunity 
to purchase local art and see some-thing they might not see elsewhere,” she said. 
Pieces will range in price from 
$40 to $80, with almost every item costing less than $200, Westermann-Clark said. This weekend’s events vary from other local festivals, said Alfred Phillips, co-director of exhib-its for the Gainesville Fine Arts As-sociation.
“There’s a lot of credit given to 
the sports community here, but a lot 
of outsiders come for art,” Phillips 
said. “It generates income for the community.”
The events aim to support the 
artists and the theatre, Phillips said.
“We want people to buy original 
art, instead of going to Wal-Mart and buying posters of it,” he said. “You can buy ﬁ  rst-rate art for the 
same price.” 
Karen Koegel, the president of 
the Gainesville Fine Arts Associa-
tion, stressed the importance of sup-porting local artists and their work.
“Local artists are the core of the 
town itself,” she said. “They’re the heartbeat of the town.”WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

apartment complexes about summer leasing start and end dates.
He then went on to address SG plans 
to get students Summer funding.
“We’ll be lobbying the state Legisla-
ture this year to fund Bright Futures in 
the Summer,” Yeffet said.
UF students are required to take Sum-
mer classes at least once, but Bright Fu-
tures does not cover Summer costs.
Yeffet also introduced more future 
SG plans, which included transportation and an education accessibility ad hoc committee created by UF Student Senate 
President Joseph Michaels.
“We want to make sure students on 
campus and off campus have the oppor-
tunity to travel at the lowest cost pos-sible,” Yeffet said.
The committee will address issues 
such as access codes, rising textbook prices and tutoring for students in high-er-level classes.
The State of the Campus Address ben-
efited a nonprofit organization run by UF students called Gainesville Reads, which partners with local schools in the city to promote the value of reading and educa-
tion. One thousand books were donated 
by the end of the night.
The address ended with a presenta-
tion from SGTV about student services provided by SG.
UF Senate information and communi-
cations chairwoman Katie Burns said the address had a lot of information for sena-tors and student organizations.
“It’s a great way to make sure every-
one’s on the same page and to see what’s to come,” Burns said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2014

and I started crying,” she said.
Kar said she plans on continuing to paint henna on pa-
tients and hopes hospitals adopt this type of art therapy.
She has reached out to UF Health Shands Hospital but 
is unable to apply henna to patients because it requires direct contact and causes liability issues.
Some doctors are excited about her art, and others view 
it as pointless for patients’ care, Kar said.“There is this difference between Eastern and Western 
medicine,” she said.
Kar said she wants to practice complementary medi-
cine and plans on obtaining a graduate certificate in arts

It may be too late for fam-
ilies still looking for a place 
to stay for December’s grad-uation weekend — many of Gainesville’s hotels are 
booked solid, and the same 
is almost true for Spring. 
The Reitz Union Hotel’s 
rooms are reserved for Spring and have been reserved for Dec. 19 and 20 since May — a week after this year’s rooms were available. 
“Parents and families 
book our rooms even if they don’t know their kid’s grad-uation date yet,” said Lorna Bouret, the hotel’s guest ser-vices coordinator. 
Even larger hotels have 
been slated for weeks, like the Hilton UF Conference Center Gainesville on 34th 
Street, which has 248 rooms. 
Richard Secord,  the UF 
Hilton’s director of sales, said 
the 100,000-square-foot hotel sold out for Fall graduation about two or three weeks ago and is also sold out for Spring. Secord said many 
parents began booking three 
to six months in advance. 
“This town does so well 
when it comes to graduation and football games,” he said. “Families want to stay at the Hilton because it’s a premier place next to campus.”
The Holiday Inn on West  
University Avenue sold out within the last week with reservations swarming in throughout November, di-
rector of sales and marketing 
Tony Saccaro said. He said 
65 of the 167 rooms the hotel has are already booked for UF’s Spring graduation. 
“Now in today’s age, a lot 
of people wait for deals and special rates before book-ing,” he said. “We’re fortu-nate to have such a premium spot near UF.”
Bouret said hotels get 
booked before almost every graduation. She said that 
families still searching for a 
room can also stay outside of Gainesville and find avail-able hotels in Ocala.
“Call as many hotels as 
possible,” she said. “You’ll find some with availabili-ties.”Hotel rooms for Fall

Food trucks, fundraising and 
festivities will all be for the kids Fri-
day.
Dance Marathon at UF and 
Cymplify Central will host the Food Truck Rally to benefit UF’s Health Shands Children’s Hospital and Gainesville’s Children’s Miracle 
Network. The fundraiser will be 
held at Cymplify, located at 5402 NW Eighth Ave., from 6 to 10 p.m.
The event is free, but Dance Mar-
athon team members will collect do-nations. Cymplify will also donate 
10 percent of its store sales and 20 
percent of its ice cream store sales.
While listening to live music pro-
vided by Gainesville Latin band Ra-mos Pinta, guests can feast on food from food trucks, including Humble Pie and Mobsta Lobsta.  
Dance Marathon Public Rela-
tions Director Melissa Dukes, 22, said miracle families will share their stories at the event.
“We just want to make this a 
place where families and students from all ages can come and enjoy a wonderful evening at Cymplify and enjoy the music and the food and  learn more about Dance Marathon,” 
she said. 
Guests are encouraged to wear 
anything that shows holiday spirit at 
the holiday-themed rally Friday. A free shuttle service will run every 10 minutes to take people to and from parking at Buchholz High School.
“There’s something for every-
one to get involved with in terms 
of Dance Marathon, so I think that this is a great way for us to intro-
duce people to Dance Marathon and show them why it’s worth investing 
their time and/or finances in it,” 
Dukes said. 
UF applied physiology and kine-
siology sophomore Rebecca Sacks, 20, took part in Dance Marathon her freshman year. She said she plans on attending the rally.

There was also a resolution to support solidarity 
between UF and Florida State University following the shooting on FSU’s campus. The bill proposes standing behind FSU and the commitment to safety on campus.
“I know we have a very healthy competition with 
FSU, but when it comes down to it, we all have friends there,” said judiciary chairman Bronco Vuskovich.UF Senate passes three resolutions“There’s	something	for

Gainesville Police arrested a woman 
after officers said she attacked her sister 
before trying to run over another woman 
with her car Monday afternoon. 
Dominique Latoya Sherman, 25, told 
police she went to pick up her Christmas 
tree from her sister, Keoinda Monique 
Sherman, shortly after noon. When she 
arrived, she and Keoinda began arguing in Keoinda’s front yard, located at 110 SE 12th St.
Dominique spit in and smacked Keoin-
da across her face, leaving a red mark on the left side, according to a report.When Terriona Dan-
ielle Walker and others nearby tried to get her to leave, Dominique got into her car and tried to 
run Walker over, a report 
said. Walker told police she kicked Dominique’s car because she was 
afraid of being run over.
Dominique then drove away. When police arrived at Keoinda’s house, 
Dominique returned to her car. Then she jumped out, went over to Keoinda and be-
gan yelling in her face. 
“I will beat your a**!” she said. “Bring 
it bitch!”Dominique was arrested on charges of 
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, 
domestic battery, disorderly conduct and driving with a suspended license. She is currently being held on a $24,000 bond.

An Alachua County sheriff was punched 
in the face Monday evening after he told a man to leave an apartment complex.
Octavian Arnold, 22, got into an argu-
ment with Whitney Johnson — with whom he has three children — shortly before 8 p.m. While officers were talking to John-son, they saw Arnold leave a nearby apart-
ment alone, according to a report. They 
told him to leave, and he agreed to do so.
After Arnold grabbed a few of his things from Johnson’s apartment, the manager of 
the complex walked up and asked police 
to trespass him immediately. 
Arnold walked away and went inside 
of another apartment. When he came out, 
officers told him to stop. He said “no” and 
began walking toward one of the officers. 
When an officer tried to grab his arm, 
Arnold punched him in the eye and gave him a large bruise. Arnold had to be tack-
led to the ground in order to be hand-
cuffed.

A Brown University pro-
fessor will give a lecture 
Thursday as part of the 
speakers series presented 
by the UF Center for the Humanities and the Public Sphere.
In her free lecture, “To-
wards New Practices of the Future,” Wendy Chun will explore the relationship be-tween scientific data, theory 
and practice, as well as how 
the humanities play a role in the future workplace at 5:30 p.m. in Smathers Library, 
Room 100.
The renowned scholar of 
media and technology will 
also discuss topics such as climate change and research 
methods that are changing 
how scientists make predic-tions about the future.
“Our aim in this series is to 
highlight the ways in which the humanities are and con-tinue to be relevant to all fac-ets of the modern workplace and our quality of life,” said 
Bonnie Effros, a UF history 
professor. “In other words, it is another way to think about the current STEM versus hu-
manities debates that sug-
gest the tight links between these areas.”
Also Brown University’s 
modern culture and media 
department chair, Chun has 
studied both English litera-ture and systems design en-gineering.
She has combined both fields into her research on digital media and in her books “Control and Free-dom: Power and Paranoia in 
the Age of Fiber Optics” and 
“Programmed Visions: Soft-ware and Memory.”
“She looks at the impact of 
big data on the way in which we understand the world,” 
Effros said, “and suggests 
the continuing importance of humanists to these interpre-tive debates.”
Chun wrote in an email 
that now is the perfect time for scientists and humani-ties scholars to come to-
gether and answer the hard 
questions about our world’s pressing problems.
Ali Yusufali, a UF mi-
crobiology and cell science senior, said Chun’s work is 
persuasive, so students will 
want to attend.
“It’s going to be an inter-
esting talk,” the 21-year-old 
said. “It shows how science, 
even with its organized knowledge and methodolo-gies, has so many philosoph-ical entities that still must be 
tackled.”Brown University

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — No house-
hold name, Ashton Carter has 
earned his stripes in the national se-curity trenches the quiet way.
For decades he has toiled as a de-
fense thinker and strategist, nuclear expert, three-time Pentagon execu-tive, budget guru and academician.
He never served in the military 
or in Congress, unlike many defense secretaries, including the man he would replace if President Barack Obama nominates him as Chuck Hagel’s successor.
But he spent a lot of time with 
troops during his 2011 to 2013 stint as deputy defense secretary and has built relationships with an entire generation of military leaders dur-ing his years in the Pentagon.
Administration officials said 
Tuesday that Carter, 60, is expected to be Obama’s nominee, putting him in line to take over a far-flung, hard-to-manage department that has had an uneasy relationship with the White House.
Obama spokesman Josh Earnest 
stopped short of confirming that the 
president had made a decision, yet 
praised Carter effusively for serving “very, very ably” at the Pentagon previously and noted he had been easily confirmed by the Senate be-fore.
“This is an indication that he ful-
fills some of the criteria that we’ve discussed in the past,” Earnest said. 
“He is somebody who definitely de-
serves and has demonstrated strong bipartisan support for his previous service in government.”
Administration officials said 
Obama could announce his nomi-nee as early as this week. The offi-cials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the president’s decision-making 
process publicly.
Carter would likely face a wel-
coming Senate confirmation hear-
ing, unlike Hagel.As the nominee in February 2013, 
Hagel was hammered with some-times sharp questioning that seemed to throw him off balance and raise doubts about his competence.
Carter, however, would be tack-
ling a pile of security problems at least as high as those Hagel took on, beginning with the further develop-
ment of a strategy to degrade and 
eventually defeat the Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.
Among other tough issues he 
would face immediately: Russia’s 
continued provocations in Ukraine, 
tensions between the White House and Defense Department over clos-ing the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center and concerns at the Pentagon over the impact of deep spending cuts.

Merry Christmas versus happy holidays
Although the onslaught of Christmas merchandise that 
begins appearing in October might have you think-ing December started weeks ago, it’s only been here 
for three days. It is ofﬁ  cially the holiday season.
However trivial I think it is, this question pops into my 
head this time of year: Merry Christmas or happy holidays?
The American Civil Liberties Union takes the stance that 
the government should say happy holidays in order to avoid promoting any particular holiday or religion due to separa-tion of church and state. This is reasonable. 
The ACLU’s stance has been slightly misinterpreted by 
those who believe that the group is trying to eliminate the phrase “merry Christmas” altogether. The ACLU believes Americans should be able to say “merry Christmas” all they 
want, but  the government should use more inclusive termi-
nology. 
Happy holidays is undoubtedly all inclusive. Christmas, 
Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, New Year’s — they are all included in the greeting. Happy holidays shouldn’t be seen as an of-fensive term, and statements suggesting the phrase creates a “war on Christmas” are a little absurd.
A year ago, Bill O’Reilly, a political commentator for Fox, 
spoke on the topic. O’Reilly said the ACLU’s stance encour-
aging merry Christmas to be removed from advertisements 
and public displays is uncalled for. O’Reilly poked fun at a Macy’s ad that said Santa could help children with their holiday wish lists. O’Reilly said, “So here’s my question to Macy’s: What holiday is Santa celebrating? Winter solstice? The birthday of a reindeer? What?”
His questions are funny and make a point. However, the 
larger issue is that Americans should be able to say both hap-py holidays and merry Christmas without fear of upsetting 
someone. For the most part, I don’t think people have that 
fear. However, media coverage would suggest otherwise.
Christmas is celebrated by Christians and non-Christians 
alike. According to a 2013 Pew Research Center survey, 90 percent of Americans celebrate Christmas, and 51 percent say it is a religious holiday. That means the other 39 percent celebrate Christmas in a secular fashion.
For those 39 percent, Christmas doesn’t have a religious connotation anyway, making mer-ry Christmas vs. happy holidays a nonissue.
A different 2013 Pew survey 
found that 42 percent of Ameri-
cans preferred merry Christmas, 
12 percent of Americans preferred happy holidays and 46 percent of Americans didn’t care. 
Jason Linkins and Katla McG-
lynn of the Hufﬁ  ngton Post made a humorous video about the issue 
called ‘‘The Political War On Christmas And Its Arch Enemy, ‘Happy Holidays.’’’ In the video, Linkins asks how happy 
holidays can be offensive — after all, the phrase’s operative 
word is “happy.” It’s hard to get much friendlier than that. 
In August 2013, Texas passed House Bill 308, the Merry 
Christmas Bill. State Representative Dwayne Bohac, R-Texas, said his son came home from school saying he decorated a holiday tree with holiday ornaments. 
It’s a Christmas tree, just like a menorah is a menorah and 
not a “winter candelabra.” McGlynn points that out in the “War on Christmas” video.
Bohac said Christmas is a federal holiday, and therefore, 
Americans should be able to call it by its name. 
Saying happy holidays and merry Christmas does not 
need to be a controversial issue. If you want to be all inclu-sive, say happy holidays. If you want to say merry Christ-mas, which is relevant to 90 percent of Americans and really not all that exclusive, then say merry Christmas.
However, don’t just say happy holidays for the sake of be-
ing politically correct. Although it may be a minor semantic 
issue, giving in to this kind of pressure represents inadver-
tent self-censorship of your First Amendment rights.
Be sensible and thoughtful with your holiday greetings, 
and remember that the intent of any happy ﬁ  ll-in-the-blank greeting is never to upset. A greeting in itself is meant to wel-come and acknowledge, not to exclude or ignore.

reveals out of 
control gun policy
In 2011, Jared Bretherick was riding in a car with his family near Orlando when another vehicle, driven by Derek Dun-ning, nearly sideswiped their vehicle.
After a brief confrontation, during which Bretherick’s father 
called 911 and revealed a holstered weapon, Dunning returned 
to his car and began backing it up toward the Brethericks. 
When deputies arrived on the scene, Bretherick was point-ing his father’s gun at Dunning’s SUV. He was arrested and charged with aggravated assault. 
In his initial court hearing, Bretherick sought legal immu-
nity under Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law. The statute, which gained national attention following the Trayvon Martin incident, protects individuals who use weapons in self-defense or in defense of others from prosecution.
Bretherick’s request for immunity was denied, but he has 
managed to appeal his case all the way to the Florida Supreme Court.
If the Court rules in Bretherick’s favor, gun owners would 
no longer have to prove that they were acting in self-defense when they brandish or use their weapons in violent confronta-tions. Instead, prosecutors would have to prove that the indi-vidual in question did not act in self-defense, a extraordinarily difﬁ  cult burden of proof. 
There is no indication that Bretherick’s life was threatened 
at any point during this confrontation. Despite the fact that he claims Dunning said he had a gun, the only weapon found on scene was the one in Bretherick’s hand. 
Fortunately, he never ﬁ  red his weapon, but it is very pos-
sible that he might have if deputies had not arrived when they did. 
Unsurprisingly, the National Riﬂ  e Association has ﬁ  led a 
brief in favor of Bretherick. As an organization heavily funded 
by gun manufacturers, the NRA has no interest in whether 
weapons are used in self-defense. Its primary interest is that more weapons are used and sold, meaning more money for gun manufacturers and the NRA.
The simple fact that this case has standing in a court of law 
demonstrates how far off track Florida’s gun policy has be-come. At every turn, judges and NRA-supported lawmakers encourage loosening of Florida’s gun restrictions, leading to an increase in unnecessary violent confrontations.
Without a doubt, Floridians should have the right to appro-
priately protect themselves and their families when their safety is threatened. However, the brandishing or ﬁ  ring of a weapon is an extremely serious matter. People who engage in such an act should be required to justify their actions if there is doubt about whether they were warranted.
If the Florida Supreme Court changes the burden of proof 
for “Stand Your Ground,” it will make Floridians less safe by encouraging the escalation of violent confrontations.  The law 
is unclear and inconsistently applied as is; making this change 
would only be asking for more trouble.WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2014

On Nov. 24, Americans experienced 
one of the saddest injustices in our history when a grand jury decided 
not to indict former Ofﬁ  cer Darren Wilson on all charges in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown from Ferguson, Missouri.
History repeats itself. For blacks in America, much 
of that history means racism, prejudice and social in-justices — not exactly things we want to repeat. Since the announcement, peaceful protests ensued across not only the country but also the world. Check any social media site, and you’ll ﬁ  nd posts from people of all col-
ors, from New York to New Zealand, protesting against 
the grand jury’s decision.
While most of the world decided to unite peacefully 
and protest in a call for action, it’s unfortunate that sen-
sationalized media like CNN chose to focus on the riots 
and looting that broke out in Ferguson following the announcement.
I watched CNN until the wee hours of Tuesday 
morning, waiting for reporters to interview one — just 
one — protester or rioter and received nothing. This did 
viewers a tremendous disservice because it gave us zero answers as to what was going through the minds of the rioters. It gave us no real information; it just allowed us 
to speculate.
The lack of well-rounded reporting left the public 
to take to social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter, 
Tumblr and Instagram to see videos and pictures of what was really happening in Ferguson.
There are many Wilson supporters who don’t under-
stand the public outcry, rage and devastation after he was not indicted. The issue is minorities feel as though the grand jury’s decision gave a clear message: Black 
lives do not matter. It didn’t matter with Trayvon Mar-
tin, John Crawford, Ezell Ford, Eric Garner, Akai Gur-ley or 12-year-old Tamir Rice.
For hundreds of years, blacks have been oppressed 
in this country. We can’t help it if we see color in every-
thing. Our justice system bases everything off of class 
and color.
A common question some white people often ask 
when tragedies like this happen is, “Why is it always 
about color with you people?”
My answer: Just look at how the media portray black 
victims in these stories.
I realize that not all Wilson supporters are white, but 
to the ones who are and are questioning the race card, it’s hard to see the realities of minorities because of 
how blinding white privilege can be. The media’s sen-sationalized reporting is just the tip of the iceberg with how they dehumanize black murder victims opposed to 
white mass murderers.Author Tim Wise recently discussed his 
many bouts with privilege on his website, 
even going as far as initiating the hashtag 
#IWasNoAngelEither, which is an effort to 
alter public opinion of Brown after the me-
dia’s many mentions of Brown’s insigniﬁ  cant marijuana usage.
Following Brown’s death in August, the Hufﬁ  ngton 
Post published a story called “When The Media Treats White Suspects Better Than Black Victims,” pointing out how the media demonize black victims opposed to cold-blooded, white killers.
Wilson referred to Brown as a supernatural de-
mon, even though they were about only an inch apart in height, and Brown was wounded before being shot twice in the head.
When people ask why protesters are making a big 
deal about race, it’s because the case is about race.
Everything about this case is about race, from the 
way Brown was targeted for jaywalking to his portrayal in the media and the fact that in a predominately black 
town, the jury consisted of nine white and three black 
people.
White people have the privilege of rarely experienc-
ing the fear of unjustly being targeted by law enforce-
ment. As awful as it is, white people have the privilege 
of murdering mass amounts of people and somehow still manage to be arrested alive. Privilege is also know-ing you’ll be remembered for how great of a person you always were in the media after doing it.
White people have the privilege of committing a 
crime and knowing that whatever sentencing they receive, it won’t be as harsh as someone who is a mi-nority. African-Americans are incarcerated at nearly 
six times the rate of whites, according to the NAACP. 
White privilege is knowing that although about 14 mil-lion whites and about 2.6 million blacks report using an illicit drug, most people won’t assume a white person uses some type of drug.
White privilege is knowing that although about ﬁ  ve 
times as many whites are using drugs as blacks, the lat-ter is 10 times more likely to be imprisoned on drug of-fenses.
So when people ask, “Why is everything always 
about race with you people?,” just look at the facts. The proof is in the numbers, but they can’t even compare to the everyday oppression of minorities.
While I don’t agree with the rioting, as a minority, I 
understand the anger behind it. I understand the feeling of hopelessness — the emotion and the desire to physi-cally ﬁ  ght.

Bo Diddley Community Plaza,  a centerpiece in 
downtown Gainesville, will soon shut down for nearly a year while the city renovates the popular 
area. While the prospect of a cleaner and more inviting plaza sounds wonderful, one issue came to mind after 
reading about the renovations: Where will Gainesville’s 
homeless go?
If you walk through Bo 
Diddley, you’ll notice the homeless sleep on the sidewalk along the west side of the pla-za. Closing the plaza for a year will certainly expel anyone from sleeping in the area, and 
something tells me that once 
the plaza reopens, the homeless will no longer have the ability to camp on the sidewalk.
All is not lost for Gainesville’s homeless, as the city has 
a new option for them: Grace Marketplace. It’s a place for homeless men, women and children to get back on their feet. Grace Marketplace provides temporary shelter, job training, medical care and other assistance to those in our 
community who are most in need. Grace is a step in the 
right direction, but it’s not a permanent solution. 
With the closure of Bo Diddley threatening the loss of 
a popular spot for the city’s homeless, we have a respon-sibility to take permanent action.  
The best solution for helping is providing opportuni-
ties to end chronic homelessness, and that’s going to need serious action from UF. Through providing job training, medical care and other social services, UF can make an 
integral difference in the lives of the homeless. However, 
another idea might work, and it involves tiny houses. 
The construction of tiny houses for the homeless is an 
idea taking root in communities throughout the U.S. Tiny houses range in size from 80 to 1,000 square feet, and in some communities, the compact size is being used to help those in need. Portland, Oregon, is a great example of the small house movement. The city is building tiny houses at a cost of $12,000 each and leasing them to homeless men 
and women at an extremely low rate in an attempt to help 
people get back on their feet. Portland isn’t alone. A fra-ternity at the University of Alabama in Huntsville is also building 500-square-foot houses for the homeless. 
Portland and Huntsville are great examples of what 
can be done when communities decide to take action on a serious problem. If the city of Portland and a fraternity in Huntsville can make a change, so can UF, Gainesville and Alachua County.
Outgoing UF President Bernie Machen recently joined 
the board of Grace Marketplace. Although this gesture is a step in the right direction, UF can and should be doing more to help the homeless community in Gainesville. UF is the economic engine that drives our community, yet it’s far too easy for all of us to ignore the plight of individuals spending their nights on the cold, unforgiving city side-walk next to Bo Diddley.
It would be incredible to see UF partner with 
Gainesville to locate and purchase available land to even-tually construct tiny houses on the property. Homeless men and women could then rent the homes for a low cost, and social workers at places like Grace Marketplace could help the homeless ﬁ  nd and maintain jobs to get their lives back on track.  
We have a responsibility to help our community. Per-
haps the Bo Diddley Community Plaza renovations pro-vide us with the opportunity to take tangible action to 
solve a crisis. A tiny house revolution cannot completely 
solve homelessness in Gainesville — nor can a fully fund-ed Grace Marketplace — but if various organizations at UF do what they can to help, we can make an enormous difference.

UF medical students will dust off their 
tacky holiday sweaters for a good cause 
Saturday. 
Runners will line up at 8 a.m. at the 
Commuter Lot on Gale Lemerand Drive, showcasing their creative, flashy holiday sweaters for the Tacky Sweater Holiday 
5K.
But the event is not all about the festive 
garb.
The run will raise money for the medical 
outreach programs part of the UF Global Health organization.
UF Global Health is a nonprofit organi-zation comprised of six groups of physi-
cians and medical students who take an-nual trips to Haiti, Ecuador, the Dominican 
Republic, Mexico and Nicaragua.
The six medical teams provided health 
care supplies and medical assistance to 
more than 6,100 people last year, according 
to the 5K registration page.
Trip leader and second-year UF medical 
student, Cristi Rabaza, 23, said while work-
ing in Dominican Republic clinic last year, her team served as many as 1,500 patients.
“The trips are really complicated, and 
there’s a lot that needs to get taken care of,” Rabaza said, “and these funds help us do what we need to do while we’re there.”Rabaza said the medical students do all 
of the hard work when it comes to plan-
ning the trips abroad, and the biggest chal-
lenge is raising the necessary funds to have a successful trip.
This is not the first time the College of 
Medicine has hosted a race to raise money for its medical trips, but this is the first hol-
iday themed event, Rabaza said.
Ben King, event coordinator and 
25-year-old graduate medical student, said 
he expects more than 200 people to partici-pate in the run and to raise about $7,000.
The organization plans to continue the 
tacky sweater idea for future fundraising, too.
“We will be doing it each year from here 
on out with the same theme,” King said.
Along with the race, there will be a com-
petition for the tackiest sweater.
Runners can register online with the link 
on the Tacky Sweater Holiday 5K Facebook page, or they can register at the event for 
an increased price.
Registration for one adult is $20 without 
a race T-shirt and $25 with a T-shirt. Chil-
dren under 12 can register for $10.
“We want people to feel like they’re con-
tributing to our cause, but at the same time, they’re having fun and they’re getting in-volved in the community,” Rabaza said.UF medical students to run in Tacky Sweater 5K to raise money

ST. LOUIS — Police are in-
vestigating Michael Brown’s 
stepfather for angry comments on the streets of Ferguson af-ter a grand jury decided not to 
indict the police officer who fa-
tally shot his stepson, a spokes-man said Tuesday.
Officials want to talk to Lou-
is Head about his comments as part of a broader investigation into the arson, vandalism and looting that followed the Nov. 24 grand jury announcement, 
St. Louis County Police spokes-
man Brian Schellman said. Twelve commercial buildings were destroyed by fire.
Brown, 18, who was black 
and unarmed, was killed Aug. 9 by Darren Wilson, who is white. Wilson, who resigned from the Ferguson department 
last weekend, had told the 
grand jury his life was being threatened, but some witnesses said Brown was trying to sur-render.
Video widely circulated af-
ter last week’s grand jury an-
nouncement shows Brown’s 
mother, Lesley McSpadden, on top of a car and breaking down as the decision blares over a ste-reo. Head, her husband, com-forts her then yells angry com-ments, including “Burn this bitch down!”
Family attorney Benjamin 
Crump has called the reaction “raw emotion,” but “complete-
ly inappropriate.” He did not 
immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday.
Head has not yet been in-
terviewed by police, and there is no timetable for when the investigation will be complete, Schellman said. He declined to discuss what specific charges Head could face. A message left with a spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert Mc-Culloch was not immediately returned.
Ferguson Police spokesman 
Jeff Small said that the depart-ment is not conducting a sepa-rate investigation of Head.
Most of the violence oc-
curred in the first two days after the announcement. Peace-ful protests have continued, including one Tuesday involv-ing students who walked out 
of classes from three Ferguson-
area high schools.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
reported that teachers joined the students, and the Ferguson-Florissant School District pro-vided buses to pick them up and return them to classes by midafternoon. It was their first 
day back in class after Thanks-
giving break was extended a day due to bad weather Mon-day, when similar walkouts were staged across the country.
While daytime protests con-
tinue, nighttime demonstra-tions have waned. There were 124 arrests in Ferguson in the 
five days following the grand 
jury announcement but none since Friday.
As a result, police and the 
National Guard are scaling back. Schellman said county officers are no longer working 12-hour shifts, though a small contingent will remain posted at night outside Ferguson po-lice headquarters, which has been a focal point for protest 
gatherings.
Gov. Jay Nixon also an-
nounced Tuesday that the Na-
tional Guard has completed du-ties in the city of St. Louis and is reducing its presence — which peaked at about 2,200 guard members — in Ferguson and elsewhere in St. Louis County. 
Still, nearly 1,300 remain in the 
region.Michael Brown’s

CLEVELAND — A Cleve-
land policeman who fatally shot a 
12-year-old thought the boy’s pellet gun was a real firearm and later said he had no choice, the officer’s father 
said.
The Nov. 22 shooting of Tamir 
Rice by 26-year-old police rookie 
Tim Loehmann outside a recreation center sparked protests in the area. Surveillance video shows Loeh-mann firing within two seconds of a patrol car stopping near Rice, who reached in his waistband for what 
turned out to be a pellet gun.
Loehmann’s father, Fred Loe-
hmann, told the Northeast Ohio 
Media Group that the officer didn’t know young the boy was.
He recalled his son saying: “I was 
right there and he went for the gun. I had no choice.”
Through their lawyer’s spokes-man, Rice’s family declined to com-ment on any details about Loeh-mann. His funeral is today.
So far, the city has not released 
statements taken from Loehmann and his police partner or their per-sonnel files. Loehmann, who joined Cleveland police in March after spending several months with the police department in suburban In-dependence, is described by others as a quiet, respectful guy who grew up in Catholic schools and tried to 
follow in his father’s footsteps, the 
publishing group said.
Fred Loehmann, who spent de-
cades in law enforcement with New York police and the U.S. Marshals Service, said his son initially was in shock after the shooting, but is now doing “pretty well.”
“He’s living his life,” the father 
said. However, the family has re-ceived threats since police publicly identified the officers involved, he said.The police department is inves-
tigating the officer’s use of deadly force, and the county prosecutor has said the case will be presented for 
a grand jury to decide whether any 
charges are merited.
Loehmann and his partner, 
Frank Garmback, 46, have returned to work from administrative leave, but are not back on patrol.
Fred Loehmann said he under-
stands something about the situation his son faced because of an experi-ence he had during his own career in New York in 1972. He saw an armed robbery suspect with something 
silver in his hand but opted not to 
shoot, and it turned out to be a gun-shaped cigarette lighter, he said.
“If it would have been a real gun, 
I’d be dead,” he said.

� IT’S A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY UF.
CODY SMITH 
Alligator Contributing Writer 
A UF survey has found that Florida residents 
are willing to spend more than they have since 
the Great Recession.
The monthly study revealed that consumer 
conﬁ  dence, a ﬁ  gure measuring citizens’ certain-ty in the economy and their personal ﬁ  nances, hit 86 points this past November.
Chris McCarty, director of the UF Survey 
Research Center, said the increase could be at-
tributed to factors such as a statewide increase 
in investing and lower gas prices.
“There are several indicators,” McCarty 
said. “A lot of people are investing in the stock 
in Florida, housing prices in Florida have held 
onto their value, oil and gas prices have fallen 
and interest rates have fallen.”
The study was conducted from Nov. 1 to 
20 and received responses from 414 Floridians 
across the state. 
High consumer conﬁ  dence also foreshadows 
more spending during the holiday season, Mc-
Carty said. 
“When consumer conﬁ  dence is up, people 
are more in a buying mood,” McCarty said. “In general, people are more optimistic.”
Floridians’ consumer conﬁ  dence has not 
been this high since March 2007, a few months before the start of the 2007-2008 ﬁ  nancial crisis.
While the survey reﬂ  ected an overall increase 
in consumer conﬁ  dence, McCarty said the same increase may not have been reﬂ  ected in a study focused on college students.
“College students are in a similar boat as the 
senior age group. They don’t experience any  dramatic increases in their income,” he said.
Joshua Larsen, a UF mechanical engineering 
senior, said he doesn’t want to spend too much money.
“I have the essentials and don’t really want 
anything in excess,” the 22-year-old said. “I have spent more in parts, but that wasn’t really holiday shopping.”
Consumer conﬁ  dence might take a punch 
next year. McCarty said pressure from the Fed-eral Reserve raising short-term interest rates could cause consumer conﬁ  dence to decrease.Florida’s consumer conﬁ  dence 
sees increase since recession

Consumer Sentiment Index:

while the labor force rose by 22,000.

For Florida football, love is in 
the air.
Or more importantly UF ath-
letics director Jeremy Foley was in the air to Fort Collins-Loveland Municipal Airport in Colorado, according to reports. 
Sunday night, Yahoo! Sports 
reported that Colorado State head coach Jim McElwain was the lead-ing candidate for the vacant Flor-ida head coaching job and had spoken to Foley the night before.
At 1:45 p.m. on Tuesday, On-
lyGators.com reported that Foley was on a plane “which is believed to be owned by a Florida booster and used by the University Ath-letic Association, took off from Gainesville Regional Airport…” 
According to the website 
FlightAware.com, a plane with the tail number N843DW de-parted Jacksonville Executive airport at 11:43 a.m. and arrived in Gainesville at 12:02 p.m. That plane then made a stop in Joplin, Missouri for 28 minutes en route to Fort Collins, and landed at 4:37 p.m.
Per flightaware, the plane is 
registered to William Victor Avi-ation LTD, a Jacksonville based aviation company and is a double engine CESSNA with nine seats.
William Victor Aviation’s 
Principal Partner is a man named Jerry Davis Jr. according to Davis’ Linkedin page. He has been with the company since January 2000.
According to the Florida 
Times-Union, Davis’ father — who is now dead — gave a $21 million gift to the University of Florida for cancer research in 2009, $20 million of which was used to create the Jerry W. and Ju-dith S. Davis Cancer Endowment. The remainder was put toward the Shands Cancer hospital.
Fort Collins-Loveland Airport 
cited privacy as a reason for not disclosing to alligatorSports who was on plane N843DW as it was en route, and multiple requests for comment from William Victor Aviation were not returned.
McElwain has a 22-16 career 
record in three seasons at Colo-rado State. The Rams are 10-2 this season.
He was named the Mountain 
West Conference Coach of the Year on Tuesday and his starting quarterback Garrett Grayson was named the conference’s Offensive Player of the Year as well.
Under McElwain, the Rams 
have improved every year win-ning four, eight and now 10 games in the years he’s coached.
Foley said in the press confer-
ence following the announcement of Muschamp’s stepping down that he wanted a coach who had a track record of offensive success. 
“I think obviously that’s what 
the Gator Nation wants and we see that and that’s what we’re certainly going to try to provide for them,” Foley said on Nov. 17. “You’ve heard me talk about it before, make sure it’s a fit for the University of Florida.”
McElwain certainly fits that 
criteria. 
But his success traces back fur-
ther than his time as head coach at Colorado State.
Following a one-year stint at 
Fresno State as the quarterbacks coach in 2007 where he improved their numbers significantly, McEl-wain was hired by Nick Saban to be the Alabama’s offensive coor-dinator and quarterbacks coach in 2008 — he remained at Alabama for four seasons. 
He coached two first-year start-
ing quarterbacks who eventually went on to finish their careers in Alabama school record books — Greg McElroy in 2009 and A.J. McCarron in 2011.

Florida’s trip to Paradise Island 
was far from a holiday in the sun. 
The Gators traveled to the Baha-
mas on Monday Nov. 24 with a 2-1 
record and No. 18 ranking, a granted slip from the No. 8 spot the Gators had owned the week before. 
Now, Billy Donovan’s Gators have 
a 3-3 record and are unranked for the first time since Jan. 31, 2011. Florida has endured some tough 
losses and equally tough wins this 
season. Florida’s three losses have 
come with a difference of just 14 points combined.
Strengths: Florida freshmen have 
made a surprisingly impactful debut. Devin Robinson and Chris Chiozza 
have combined for 232 minutes and 
57 points.

needed spark for the young team. Progress report: Florida

� THE JUNIOR LEADS UF IN RUSHING 
YARDS THIS SEASON.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Add Matt Jones to the list of UF football 
players leaving Florida early for the NFL 
Draft.
The junior tailback will forgo his senior 
season and take the opportunity to go pro, 
according to multiple media reports.
GatorCountry.com was the first to report 
Jones’ decision, citing multiple sources.
Jones hinted at the possibility of leaving 
for the NFL Draft on his Twitter account 
(@mattjonesrb) when he posted “Closer To My Dream..!!” followed by an emoji on Nov. 19 — four days following Florida’s 23-20 overtime loss to South Carolina and 
three days after the school announced that 
Will Muschamp would not return next sea-son as the Gators’ head coach.
Jones is the third Florida player to leave 
school early in favor of the NFL Draft, join-
ing fellow juniors Dante Fowler Jr. and Ty-
ler Moore.
Jones finished the regu-
lar season with a team-leading 817 rushing yards to go along with six rush-ing touchdowns. Both of those numbers are career highs.
Jones recorded three 
games this season with at least 100 rushing yards 
— including rushing for a career-high 192 yards in Florida’s 38-20 upset win against then-No. 11 Georgia on Nov. 1.
With Jones looking to go pro, Kelvin 
Taylor will look to receive the bulk of the touches in the backfield come next season.

see hooPs, PA ge 15with Jones this season and still managed 
to accrue 565 rushing yards and six touch-downs.
Taylor proved during his freshman year 
that he is capable of taking the load.
Last season, after Jones was ruled out 
for the season with a meniscus tear suf-fered against LSU, Taylor started four of the final six games of the season and rushed for 410 yards and four touchdowns during that span.
Joining Taylor in Florida’s backfield 
next season are junior Mark Herndon, true freshman Brandon Powell and redshirt 
freshman Adam Lane, and all three have 
shown they have the potential for playing time.
Powell has seen the most action among 
the three this season. The Deerfield Beach, Florida, native has a combined 197 yards of offense on 28 touches this season.
Herndon’s 2014 season was cut short 
after tearing his ACL on a kickoff return during Florida’s 42-21 loss to Alabama on Sept. 27. His lone highlight of the season 
was an 80-yard catch-and-run touchdown 
from quarterback Treon Harris during the fourth quarter of Florida’s season opener against Eastern Michigan.
Lane had a breakout performance dur-
ing Florida’s Orange & Blue spring game, rushing for a team-high 67 yards on 12 
carries and catching three passes for 12 
yards.
But the Winter Haven, Florida, native 
has been used sparingly this season be-cause of the depth of the running back position this season. On the season, he has eight carries for 72 yards.the Crimson Tide compiled a re-
cord of 48-6, and also led the na-
tion committing only 57 turnovers 
on offense under his tenure.
Florida committed 30 turn-
overs during the 2014 season alone. 
In 2011, Alabama led the SEC in 
rushing at 219.8 yards per game, ranked second in total offense at 433.4 total yards per contest and 
third in scoring at 36 points per 
game.
McElwain was hired by Colo-
rado State after his 2011 season at Alabama. Currently his Rams of-
fense ranks 13th in total offense, 
seventh in passing offense, 25th in 
scoring offense, seventh on third down conversion percentage and 
54th in red zone scoring offense. 
Foley previously stated that he 
would like to make the hire some-
time before Christmas.

Florida’s Savannah Jor-
dan has been named one of 
16 female semifinalists for 
the 2014 Missouri Athletic 
Club’s (MAC) Hermann Tro-phy, the most prestigious in-dividual award in collegiate 
soccer.
Jordan is one of only two 
sophomores nominated for 
the award.
The other 14 are either 
juniors or seniors, including Virginia’s Morgan Brian, last year’s award winner.
The award is determined 
by NCAA Division I coaches, who will vote for their top picks between Dec. 2 and Dec. 11. 
Fans can also vote online 
for their top choice.
The three male and female 
finalists will be named in mid-December, and the win-ner for each will be named at the banquet on Jan. 15 — in a similar fashion to the Heis-man Trophy ceremony.
No UF player has ever 
won the award.
Jordan led the Southeast-
ern Confer-
ence with 46 
points and 
19 goals this season and was named 
to the All-
SEC first team. 
She was also awarded 
SEC player of the week three times during the year.
She is second only to Ga-
tor-legend Abby Wambach in goals scored through her 
freshman and sophomore 
seasons combined, and she was also part of the U.S. ros-ter for the FIFA Under-20

Midway through the nonconfer-
ence schedule of the Florida Gators 
women’s basketball team, things 
are starting to click. Sitting comfort-
ably at 5-1, Florida’s lone loss came against St. John’s on the road. With tough victories over quality op-
ponents Georgetown and Virginia 
Tech, Florida’s hustle and effort highlighted an improved team – one that wants to not just outscore its opponent, but also ensure the other 
team finds it as difficult as possible 
to get the ball in the basket.
With an increased emphasis on 
the defensive end, dubbed “Hector” 
by the team and strength and con-
ditioning coordinator Tyler Stuart, the Gators have taken pride in their ability to force its opponent into turnovers.
Strengths: Evidenced by Flor-
ida’s 73-44 win over the Hokies on Monday night, the Gators have re-lied on an aggressive yet fluid full 
court man-to-man defense to force 
its opponent into turnovers.
The suffocating defense has Flor-
ida averaging 13.3 steals per game, which the Gators have relied on 
to run a fast break offense. Florida 
came into Monday’s contest aver-aging 82.8 points per game, yet al-lowing its opponent to average 65.8 
points against them.
The full court press the Gators 
have shown has been stifling at 
times. With the forwards often play-ing in the back court, guards Carlie Needles and Cassie Peoples have been tasked with staying in front of the opposition’s point guard. Needles and Peoples have shown 
a tendency to follow the basketball 
and get steals, often resulting in fast break points on the other end. Peoples leads the team in steals, av-
eraging 3.2 per game, and Needles 
follows close behind with 2.4 per game.Weaknesses: Even though Flor-
ida has had difficulty in starting the game with a considerable sense of pace, the team has relied upon 
the full court press to instill a sense 
of urgency and vigor in its offense. Florida has often found itself un-able to move the ball efficiently in 
the post, which has resulted in turn-
overs underneath the opponent’s basket. In these cases, the team has shown a tendency to not retreat on defense, as the Gators would prefer to stay in front of their opponent and press the entire length of the court. 
An early weakness of the team has 
been an inability to run the offense through the post, which has limited the offense to plays involving swing-
ing the ball between slashing guards 
around the three point line.
Key player: After leading scorer Ronni Williams missed time with a sprained ankle she suffered in a loss at St. John’s, freshman Haley Loren-zen was inserted into the starting 
lineup, adding a considerable size 
advantage that has given the Gators a center presence they’ve sorely missed at times. With Kayla Lewis 
and Williams playing similar for-
ward roles, the team has been hesi-tant to play the duo with Lorenzen. However, with the strides Peoples and Needles have shown through-
out the early going, Butler may 
choose to alter the lineup to add more height, allowing Williams to play a guard/forward hybrid posi-
tion.
Outlook: With two road games in 
the next week, including one against 
rival Florida State on Sunday, But-ler may continue to tinker with the 
lineup before the competition heats 
up heading into Southeastern Con-ference play. The SEC is as deep as ever, with five teams ranked in the 
AP Top 25, and the height advantage 
will matter more come January.
The Gators were often under-
sized in the post last season, but that’s no longer an issue. If the team 
continues to move the ball well in 
the post like it has in its last two games, Florida could be a surprise SEC contender in what may be the 
strongest conference in basketball. 
But just like Butler has stressed to 
the team, success comes through ap-
plication of the work the team puts in on the court.WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Progress report: Height, experience helping Gators early
Horford averages 10.3 points per game
Robinson has appeared in the starting lineup twice and 
both have clocked minutes in every game so far. 
Their most promising characteristic may be their lack 
of injury. 
With two of Florida’s senior players sidelined with 
injuries at different points so far, Chiozza and Robinson provide reliability that Donovan’s roster lacks in other 
areas.  
Weaknesses: Florida has consistently struggled in 
the second half of all six games played.
Donovan agrees that his team is struggling to put two 
complete 20 minute halves together and he believes this disconnect is mental and not a lack of knowledge or abil-
ity.
“We’re a team that kind of broke apart a little bit, not 
because of jealousy or bad chemistry or don’t like each 
other. They’re focused on themselves. That’s a danger-
ous recipe,” Donovan said after Florida’s 69-67 loss to Miami on Nov. 17. 
“If we would’ve played the first half and second half 
as kind of mirrored halves together and come up short, 
we would probably be evaluative of where we’ve got 
to get. “Right now for me, this is not even a basketball thing. It has nothing to do with basketball. This is much, much more of a mental issue in terms of them handling 
their own personal expectations.”
Key Player: Jon Horford has proven his value and 
then some. 
The transfer center from Michigan is averaging 10.3 
points per game and has started all six games. With his first 175 minutes in a Florida uniform in the books, some Gator fans are seeing flashes of the greatness displayed 
by his brother, Al Horford—on Donovan’s 2004-2007 teams.
Like his brother, who ranks second in UF history in 
blocked shots, Horford leads this years’ team in block-
ing by a long shot. 
Freshman Devin Robinson’s four are second to 6-foot-
10 Horford’s 10 blocks.
With the graduation of Will Yeguete and Patric 
Young, Horford has stepped up to the plate in provid-
ing depth for Florida’s frontcourt.
Outlook: Six games in and already unranked, Florida 
has been slipping since the start of the season, but there are signs of better days ahead. 
Friday night’s game against No. 11 Kansas (5-1) will 
be more crucial than initially anticipated as Florida bal-
ances a 3-3 record. 
A road win over Kansas has the potential to provide 
Florida with some much-needed positive momentum. 
But a loss wouldn’t be the end all be all. 
The Gators still have 25 games ahead of them and 
Southeastern Conference play is a month away.hooPS , from page 13

Maddy Monserez’s entire family sat in the stands. Her 
sister stood on the court.
She hardly noticed.
“I’m the kind of player who needs to be focused,” 
Monserez said.
While South Carolina’s setter Allie Monserez ran out 
onto the O’Connell Center ﬂ  oor with a wide smile to greet her friends and relatives in attendance, her sister, Maddy, didn’t. 
“I have a game to play,” she said. “I have to get 
ready.”
It was senior night, and Florida defeated South Caro-
lina 3-0 last Wednesday in its ﬁ  nal conference match of the season. UF’s Monserez ﬁ  nished with 12 digs, tied for 
a team high.
Three days later, in Florida’s 3-2 win over No. 3 Texas, 
she ﬁ  nished with nine digs, one service ace and an assist.
But Monserez’s impact on the team can’t be measured 
in statistics.
“Their names and numbers aren’t going to jump out in 
the box score,” coach Mary Wise said of UF’s three back 
row seniors: Holly Pole, Taylor Unroe and Monserez. “But if you’re inside our house, if you see how we work, 
you will know that they are the centerpiece of this team 
right now.”
Monserez, as well as Pole and Unroe, provides lead-
ership and guidance to a front row consisting largely of undergrads. And while Monserez may not be the most talented player on the court at any given time, she is one of the most valuable.
Since her freshman year, she has exempliﬁ  ed the type 
of gritty, grind-it-out player that is the trademark of 
Wise’s coaching style.
“(She’s grown) as much if not more than any player 
I’ve ever coached,” Wise said. “A year ago at this time, 
Maddy was not playing… and fast forward to the end of the season and the person who had the best match was Maddy.
“What that did, that lesson that we were able to de-
scribe to the rest of the team in January, really has become a part of the theme.”
It’s the same theme that Wise implants into all of her 
players, starter or benched: Be ready when your name is called.
Over four years, Monserez has embraced it.“I think that’s been (my) biggest progression, just see-
ing the big picture,” she said.
Her job is to provide digs in the back row when they are needed, and to ensure her teammates are doing their jobs as well.
She applauded her teammates’ increasing volleyball 
intelligence, which is at its highest point of the season rid-ing a 20 match winning streak entering the NCAA tourna-ment.
Most of Florida’s success would not have been possible 
without Florida’s veteran defensive specialists providing leadership and communicating Wise’s message: there is always room for improvement. 
“I think it’s exciting for us because we’ve improved 
so much and it’s just really nice to be tested before the NCAA’s,” Monserez said. “We’re really excited to put that to use and get to see where we are at the end of the season.”
Does the senior have a prediction for the NCAA tour-
nament, the fourth one with teammates Pole and Unroe and the last one of her collegiate career?
“I have the utmost faith in my teammates,” Monserez 
said. “And I think that no matter what, they’re gonna 
ﬁ  ght as hard as they can.”
Then, she paused.
“These girls, you know, its really crazy if you just knew 
them. The whole team, all 17 of them. They’re the most amazing group of people I’ve ever been around. And I think everyone on this team, no matter what they do with their life, no matter what goals they have for themselves, on this team and after, they can do it.”
