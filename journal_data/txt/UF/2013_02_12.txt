After serving about eight years as the leader of the Catho-
lic world, Pope Benedict XVI announced Monday that he will 
resign from his papacy.
Pope Benedict, 85, announced he would step down from 
his post at the end of February, citing his old age as his rea-son.
His resignation marks the ﬁ  rst time a pope has stepped 
down from his post in about 600 years.
“I think we have to offer some praise to this person,” said 
David Hackett, UF associate professor of American religious history. “He knows he really can’t hold this job right now, and he’s recognized his limitations. He realized it, and I think this is great.”
Pope Benedict, formerly known as Joseph Ratzinger, was 
elected pope in 2005 at the age of 78, making him one of the oldest elected popes in history.
Traditionally, the next step is a period of mourning, Hack-
ett said, followed by a gathering of cardinals, known as a con-clave, for the election of the new pope. But this situation is anything but traditional.
“What it will be is more of an administrative period,” said 
the Rev. David Ruchinski, pastor of St. Augustine Church. “The sedevacantism [the empty seat], which is normally char-acterized by mourning, in this case is going to be the time that they need to be able to pull together the cardinals for the con-clave.”
But the timing of Pope Benedict’s announcement comes at 
a busy time for most bishops as Easter is rapidly approach-ing.
“Since Easter is the time when converts come into the 
church on Easter Vigil, most bishops wouldn’t want to be away from their dioceses,” Ruchinski said. “I would think that they wouldn’t pull the conclave together until after that.”
One such Easter convert is Emily Stowers.

Gov . Rick Scott discussed his 
budgeting plans for UF and toured 
the university’s Nanoscale Research Facility during a press conference Monday morning.
State senators, UF ofﬁ  cials and 
students ﬁ  lled the facility lobby as they listened to Scott declare his support of making UF one of the top 10 public universities in the nation.
Scott said he plans to give UF 
about $15 million annually for the next ﬁ  ve years.
“At the end of that timeframe, 
we will have a top 10 university ,” he said.
Although the budget plan still 
needs legislative approval, Scott said investing in UF will create more jobs throughout the state.
UF President Bernie Machen said Scott’s support for UF displays his commitment to education.
“He recognizes the inextricable 
link between education and eco-nomic development,” he said.
Cammy Abernathy , dean of the 
College of Engineering, said invest-ments like the bonus have allowed her college to be among the best in the country and will make Florida “the home of the next great high-tech hub.”

said if the budget is approved, the

The news that millennials are the most 
stressed generation does not come as a sur-
prise to UF students.
Environmental science junior Benjamin 
Robinson, 21, said it sounds about right, though he doesn’t count himself among the highly stressed.
“I don’t feel an extreme amount of stress 
usually, but I know others who have it a lot worse than I do,” he said.
The American Psychological Association 
released last week the results of its annual Stress in America survey, which attempts to measure stress levels and causes of stress in the United States. The survey showed mem-bers of the Millennial generation, aged 18 to 33, were more stressed on average than the rest of the population.
Participants were asked to rank their 
stress levels on a 10-point scale, with 10 be-ing “a great deal of stress.”
Millennials reported an average of 5.4, compared to the national average of 4.9, ac-cording to the survey,
The survey also showed millennials had 
the highest rate of depression diagnoses for any generation: 19 percent, compared to 14 percent in participants ages 34 to 47 and 12 percent for participants ages 48 to 66.
The leading cause of stress for millennials 
was reported as work, followed closely by money.  Relationships, family responsibili- Millennials are the most stressed generation, study showsLocals react to

The Alachua County Democratic Black 
Caucus hosted the second candidate forum 
of the 2013 Gainesville mayoral and District 4 City Commission campaigns Tuesday night at the Alachua County Administration Building.
The debate began just after 6 p.m. with 
about 50 people in attendance.
Former Commissioner W.E. “Mac” 
McEachern was the only participant in the District 4 debate with Alfredo Espinosa, a 20-year-old UF building construction junior, and incumbent Randy Wells was absent.
A volunteer from Wells’ campaign said 
Wells couldn’t be at the debate because of a community development committee meeting that conflicted with the forum.
The first segment of the debate focused on 
the District 4 race.
McEachern said he would work to attract 
employers to Gainesville and protect neigh-borhoods from business encroachment. He also mentioned his goal of closing the gap be-tween local government and city residents.
“Commissioners are employees of the citi-
zens,” he said.Mark Venzke, former Gainesville-Alachua 
County Regional Airport Authority board member Peter Johnson, Donald Shepherd Sr. and former city commissioners Scherwin L. Henry and Ed Braddy participated in the mayoral debate. Mayor Craig Lowe was not in attendance due to a family emergency.
Among the issues discussed during the de-
bate were the city’s biomass facility contract and the Bus Rapid Transit system.
All the mayoral candidates said they would 
support pulling the city out of the current bio-mass contract. The facility is set to become op-erational later this year.
In regards to the proposed Bus Rapid Tran-
sit system, Braddy said it’s too expensive, add-ing that city funds should be used to reduce bus wait times in east Gainesville.
BRT features longer, higher-capacity buses 
and bus-only traffic lanes that allow for the 
bypassing of traffic congestion. BRT has lon-ger distances between stops than traditional buses. BRT buses have  floors the same height as curbs, and covered bus stations.
“(BRT) would be just taking a big pile of 
money and throwing it in a hole for us to do 
that,” Braddy said.
V enzke proposed implementing it on a trial 
basis to determine if the system were to work. 
Henry said BRT is a good concept, but the city should focus on improving the current Regional Transit System bus service and fix-ing roads first. Johnson said for something like BRT or im-
proved RTS service to work, it must be a vi-able option for Gainesville residents.

Women veiled and unveiled 
Monday.
Islam on Campus invited all 
women to experience a day wear -
ing a hijab, a veil that covers the 
head. Participants of “Hijab for a Day” put on the headscarf in the morning then proceeded with their daily routine.
Sumrah Iqbal, a 20-year-old UF 
mechanical engineering junior, coordinated the event, which is part of UF’s Islam Awareness Month.
This is the first year the orga-nization has done this, and Iqbal said she was happy with the sup-port the event received.
The organization hosted a dis-
cussion Monday evening with about 35 participants who reflect-ed upon their experiences wear -
ing the hijabs with women who wear the headscarf daily.
Students were surprised by 
the reactions they received.
“It was an amazing experience 
to be able to understand so much about a culture in just one day,” Jessica Thompson, a 21-year-old UF sociology junior, said. “I felt a responsibility to uphold the culture and be sure I was seen re-spectfully.”
Shirley Roseman said she felt 
empowered by wearing the hi-jab.
“I realized how much of my 
personality and how much I fo-cus on my hair as my identity. I was afraid that I would feel sig-nificantly insecure putting [the hijab] on,” the 23-year-old UF sociology and psychology junior said. “But as soon as I put it on, I felt a lot freer because I didn’t have my hair guarding me.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2013

The National Science Foundation selected a 
UF engineering professor to serve as assistant 
director for the Directorate of Engineering, known as the ENG.
UF professor Pramod P . Khargonekar will 
retain his position at the university while lead-ing the ENG directorate with an annual bud-get of more than $800 million.
He said he is “most excited about the op-
portunity to provide leadership in engineer -
ing research and education.”ENG invests in frontier engineering re-
search and education, cultivates an innovation ecosystem and develops the next-generation engineer, according to a press release.
Khargonekar served as the dean of the Col-
lege of Engineering from 2001 to 2009. Most recently, he has been a member of NSF’s En-gineering Advisory Committee, where he pro-vided guidance to ENG on strategic directions, according to the release.
Kyle Collins, a 22-year-old UF electrical 
computer engineering senior, said he was ex-cited to see a professor who teaches in his ma-jor receive this recognition.“I’ve always known that our program is 
extremely, extremely good, and this just kind of solidifies that even more,” he said.
Khargonekar’s engineering research en-
compasses smart grid and renewable energy , semiconductor manufacturing, and modeling and control of neural systems.
Khargonekar said he believes his appoint-
ment will enhance visibility and recognition for both the College of Engineering and UF. He will begin his NSF appointment in March.
“When someone gets recognized this high-
ly for what he does, it certainly looks good on the university ,” Collins said. 
NSF Director Subra Suresh said in the re-
lease that Khargoneker brings leadership and creativity in engineering research. 
“He has helped pioneer interdisciplinary 
efforts between the biological and engineer -
ing research communities and demonstrated a deep appreciation for developing the STEM workforce, which is an NSF priority ,” Suresh said. National Science Foundation chooses professor to lead directorate

With security concerns at the 
forefront of students’ thoughts 
on traveling to Israel, Joshua Kahn found a way to spark conversation about Birthright.
Birthright is a free 10-day 
trip to Israel for Jewish young adults ages 18 to 26.
The 28-year-old Jewish 
agency Israel fellow at UF’s Hillel ordered 500 condoms adorned with the phrase “Is-rael: it’s safe to come” and 300 Ping-Pong balls with the say-ing “Israel: let’s bounce,” in hopes of raising registration numbers. 
UF anthropology sopho-
more Gavin Casper, 19, noticed the promotional items Kahn was handing out.
“I just think it’s really fun-ny,” he said. “I think it definite-ly spreads the word, but I’m surprised that they’re doing something so out there.”
That’s what Kahn was hop-
ing for.
“When people see us they 
say, ‘Wait, you guys are giv-ing out condoms?’ At the bare minimum, it gets people to talk about Israel and gets some peo-ple on the website,” Kahn said.
Today and Wednesday , UF 
Hillel staff members will con-tinue handing out items on Turlington Plaza and Plaza of the Americas.
Kahn has already noticed 
an increase in hits and pre-registration numbers at www.UFIsrael.org.
“Anything that’s a little 
edgy is definitely going to make some people a little uncomfort-able,” he said. “I think that it’s great because it pushes people outside their comfort zone and gives them the ability to look at Israel in a different light.”Promo items attract

A formerly vacant downtown ware-
house has become the new launchpad 
for a Gainesville robotics manufactur -
ing company to take off.
Prioria Robotics Inc. moved into a 
previously Gainesville Regional Util-ities-owned 20,000-square-foot ware-house Thursday after the city funded a $2.25 million, 14-month renovation project for the building.
Prioria manufactures small, un-
manned aerial vehicles primarily for the U.S. military, said Bryan da Fronta, Prioria CEO and a UF alumnus.
The company produces airplanes 
with two- to five-foot wingspans and drones that could take off and land.
Da Fronta said he chose to move his 
company, which has been operating in Gainesville for almost 10 years, from a Wells Fargo building located at 104 N. Main St., because he needed more space for production but wanted to stay con-nected to downtown.
“We didn’t want to be out in the 
middle of nowhere,” he said.
Lynn Janoski, Community Redevel-
opment Agency finance manager, said the city purchased the warehouse from GRU for redevelopment and is renting the space to Prioria.
The long-term lease, which began 
Thursday, will last for seven years, she said.
Since July, Janoski said, the ware-
house has gone through a transforma-tion from industrial storeroom to a functional office space.
“The building had almost no win-
dows,” she said. “It was pretty much an open space with plywood walls before. Just a shell — very basic.”
Janoski said the city will recoup the 
millions it pitched into the renovation through the lease.
“Over time, the rental revenues will 
pay back the investments,” she said. Robotics company finds new home in GRU warehouse

Looking for a quick romantic 
rendezvous?
Well, there’s an app for that.
“Bang With Friends,” a Facebook 
application launched last month, as-sists the hooking up process and ex-tinguishes the sting of rejection.
The company website uses a 
condom application visual aid to explain how the app works. Users can choose their Facebook friends who use the app who they wish to “bang.” Both parties receive a noti-fication email only if the interest is mutual.
Alan Medrano, a 22-year-old UF 
musical theatre senior, said he is not surprised the app exists. He said he sees it as a tool people can use.
“I prefer building a relationship 
and talking, so something like that wouldn’t work for me,” Medrano said. “But there are some people who are looking for a one-time thing. Or maybe they’re shy, and this is the way to get them in the door.”
The app had about 20,000 reg-
istered users four days after it launched, according to an article by www.TheDailyBeast.com.
Medrano said he believes men will make up the primary user de-mographic and women would be much less interested in the app.
UF psychology professor Laurie 
Mintz said research indicates male pleasure is prioritized in hookups involving sex.
“Research finds that women are 
less likely to have orgasms and re-port being satisfied in hookup sex than are men,” Mintz said.
Mintz discussed hookup sex with 
her human sexuality class and said some student comments pertained to women feeling pressured to en-gage in hookup sex. 
Kristen Croft, an 18-year-old UF 
industrial and systems engineering freshman, said she does not foresee a lot of women using the app, in-cluding herself.
“I honestly think that’s kind 
of grimy in general,” she said. “I would like to think no one would put themselves out there like that. It’s very controversial.”
Although Croft said social media has aided communication between partners overall, she thinks apps like “Bang With Friends” discourage flirting and reduce the conversation between men and women simply to, “Hey, let’s get it on.”
Medrano agrees. He said the app 
takes away from the excitement of personal interaction.
“I’d say communication has 
changed compared to how previous generations expect communication to be,” he said. “A couple years ago, I would have been surprised to hear about the app, but with all the differ -
ent social networking sites and ways to meet people, it just seems like the next step.”

boy by his local priest for six years and was later offered €25,000 (then £17,000) by his diocesan bishop to keep quiet, said: ‘We won’t miss this pope,’” according to The Guardian.
It was not a fun papacy , but really , when has there ever been 
a fun papacy? Plenty of sexual abuse scandals and Nazi jokes galore, and here we are eight years later.
It’s like the pope is graduating along with the current se-
nior graduating class of UF. Our time here on campus actually sounds a lot like Benedict’s time in the Vatican.
His 89-year-old brother, Georg Ratzinger, according to The 
Guardian article, said, “Age is weighing on him. My brother would like more rest at this age.”
We feel ya. We’ve been at this school for four years, and 
enough is enough. We’d also like to resign, but we don’t have that kind of freedom. What do you think the pope will do now that he’s a single man out on the town? Breaking up with God is probably a pretty liberating experience.
Will he take a year off and study abroad? Will he go on as 
many dates as “The Bachelor”? Will he go to grad school, like some of us might? Maybe he’ll try to make it in the Big Apple or the City of Angels over on the West Coast. He’s got some op-tions. So do we.
“This is disconcerting, he is leaving his ﬂ  ock,” said Alessan-
dra Mussolini, a parliamentarian who is granddaughter of Ita-ly’s wartime dictator, according to a Reuters article. “The pope is not any man. He is the vicar of Christ. He should stay on to the end, go ahead and bear his cross to the end. This is a huge sign of world destabilization that will weaken the Church.”
Listen, maybe he just needed some time to ﬁ  nd himself. He 
has to learn to love himself before he can love others.
“In his announcement, the pope told the cardinals that in or-
der to govern ‘... both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months, has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to ad-equately fulﬁ  ll the ministry entrusted to me,’” the Reuters article said.
Sometimes we need to take mental health breaks while study-
ing, so it doesn’t get too intense or stressful. We don’t blame the pope for stepping down at all. We get it. It’s time to move on to bigger and better things. Most world leaders seem to accept his decision with heavy hearts and understanding.
By Easter, a new pope will be selected, just like the next class 
of Gators. Are you ready for change?
Because if the pope knows when to step down and make 
hard life decisions, we should, too.‘No dating’ rule in J-Pop is just bafﬂ  ing
Having ridiculously good-looking, teenage heart-throbs in pop music is not a new concept.
It didn’t start with One Direction, it didn’t start 
with *NSYNC , and it didn’t even start with The Beatles, but I will venture to say it has been perfected by Japan.
Japan has put such a formulated expertise on its pop mu-
sic that it’s created a new name for a genre casually referred to as J-pop.
Full of beautiful girls-next-door and handsome, sensitive 
men who can all sing and dance, J-pop is nothing short of a pop culture cash cow. It makes sense, in a way , that bands’ management teams would have a pretty big say in the go-ings-on.
But being contractually obligated to not date anyone 
seems like a new one to me.
Minami Minegishi is a member of the J-pop group AKB48 
and is now in serious hot water because — gasp — she was seen coming out of a boy’s apartment after they had spent the night together. 
This sounds like any day of the week for American ce-
lebrity news, but for Minegishi, this was scandalous because AKB48 has a strict no dating rule for the band’s about 90 members. 
Why would a group’s management team forbid 90 girls 
in their mid-teens and early 20s to date?
Simple. They don’t want to shatter the illusion that the 
male fans of AKB48 still stand a chance with the members. It’s a concept that is alive and well in any other girl or boy band — the beautiful people you see on the screen are un-touchable, but in some way, only yours.
AKB48’s management just did the logical, but ethically 
questionable, act of locking in that fantasy by having the girls sign on the dotted line.
When found out by paparazzi, Minegishi shaved all of 
her hair off in repentance and took to YouTube in a tearful apology, where she called her actions thoughtless and im-mature and begged the band to let her stay on as a member.
I don’t think too many people will fault you for that one, 
dear.
Although your management team is trying its best to market its chaste army, you will still be living every day with teen-age girls that, shockingly, like teenage guys.
You’ve pitted your biology 
against your income, and in every single way, it’s a volatile combina-tion.
Looking at the news articles, it 
struck me how much of a cultural 
divide there was here. I don’t think any U.S. celebrity would ever agree to such a rule  — much less tearfully apologize when they’ve inevitably broken it.  
It took Britney Spears how many failed marriages, drug 
rehabilitations and psychotic breakdowns to shave her head, and this girl does it after one little sleepover.
And do you know how many times Britney Spears has 
apologized for her constant train wreck of decision making? Never. 
In that way, I am strangely proud to call myself Ameri-
can.
Is AKB48’s management a bit screwy for mandating such 
a rule? Some would say they are just giving audiences what they want. If there are girls who know about the rule and are still willing to sign on to get pop star glory, then by all means, let them.
On the other hand, some could say,  who is anyone to dic-
tate this very personal part of another’s life? Who the heck does some music producer think he is to outlaw the normal behavior of teenage girls just to see the proﬁ  ts rise?
Honestly, I am just glad we wouldn’t have a debate like 
this stateside.
Now, whenever I go to the checkout line at Publix and 
see the tabloid headlines of beautiful people making terrible decisions, I will take solace in the fact that our celebrities live their lives regardless of their public images, for better or worse.

Peace Corps’ announcement this week that UF leads the na-
tion in alumni recruits is a testament to UF’s longstanding connection with one of America’s most respected volunteer 
service organizations. UF recruited 107 undergraduate and 26 graduate alumni volunteers in 2012 and tied with the University of Washington for the No.1 spot. UF’s future connection to the Peace Corps remains uncertain, however, and for once, it isn’t UF’s fault.
Peace Corps is dedicated to placing volunteers in jobs abroad 
to live in foreign nations as trained workers and goodwill ambas-sadors. From its founding in 1961, Peace Corps has had a history of success, and UF grads consistently show themselves to be enthusi-astic to make the goals of service a reality year after year.
And yet, current students find themselves on campus this year 
without a recruiter to turn to.
This is in stark contrast to years past, when students turned to 
Amy Panikowski, who worked on campus for seven years as Peace Corps’ recruiter and sent hundreds of UF alumni abroad.
Peace Corps volunteers sign two years of their lives away to a 
cause they believe is bigger than themselves, and Panikowski con-sistently brought that to fruition with her support. You couldn’t find someone who loved the Peace Corps more than her, and it showed in everything she did. She visited classrooms, hosted Globe Talk presentations, organized a dedicated group of interns, always kept an upbeat attitude and was constantly available by email, phone or office hours.
To see both Panikowski and her be-
loved UF community treated like this by an organization whose popularity and staying power is based on the willing en-thusiasm of its volunteers is confounding. Rarely would a program ranked so high 
see its recruiting staff cut without any plans for growth or replace-ment.
Panikoswki lost her job as a result of red tape and infighting, 
and Peace Corps never accepted a replacement, meaning they also lost their most valuable link to UF.
Leaving UF in the dark this year is a glaring error by Peace 
Corps’ bureaucracy that got lost in the shuffle somewhere at head-quarters, but it will have a very clear impact with supporters in Gainesville.
UF has always been proud of its alumni serving abroad, and 
Gainesville is continually enriched by the presence of its returned Peace Corps volunteers.
But the lack of direct access on campus will inevitably mean a 
shrinking presence of the Gator Nation in Peace Corps.
There is no way a recruiter available mostly by phone and 
email, with several scheduled visits a semester, can accomplish what Amy Panikowski did as a campus recruiter every day she came to work.
UF has ranked in the upper tiers of Peace Corps’ top-recruiting 
schools for years. As a land-grant, sea-grant and space-grant uni-versity with more than 100 undergraduate majors in 16 colleges, supported by about 200 research, service and education centers, it is no surprise why . Last year, even Peace Corps Director Aaron Williams  visited UF’s campus to announce the beginning of a Mas-ter’s International program here and congratulate the Gainesville community on its impressive service record.
The character of UF and our alums will remain the same. Gators 
are well educated, altruistic and ready to serve, but it is up to Peace Corps to make the connection between a potentially fantastic vol-unteer and the opportunity for them to do good work. That comes from a recruiter with a friendly smile, an open door and facts in her hand. Our university deserves that kind of concrete support, rather than a glancing recognition, from the organization our alumni con-tinue to serve with such distinction.
Peace Corps will be holding its first information session of the 
semester Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at the International Center in the Hub.

Speaking Out
During the 2012 election, 
many voters were forced to wait in line for hours to cast 
a ballot or had to cast a provisional ballot. If you’re a college student and this happened to you, you can thank Rep. Dennis Baxley and Ala-chua County GOP Chair Stafford Jones.
Three years ago, when Gainesville 
Mayor Craig Lowe won his election by 42 votes, Jones and his friends in the Republican Party claimed college students were part of an elaborate conspiracy to get voters to change their residency for one day in order to vote. The Alachua County Supervisor of Elections office found absolutely no evidence of any sort of conspiracy. Later, even Jones admit-ted he had no proof to his claim.
However, a lack of facts hasn’t 
stopped the GOP before. Despite any evidence of a real problem, Jones worked with Republican Rep. Baxley to make it harder for college students to vote. The law Baxley sponsored prevented students from voting if they did not change their residency to Alachua County at least a month before the election. Be-fore the law, a student from another county could still vote in Gainesville on the day of the election, as long as election officials verified they had not voted in any other county.
Students who did not change 
their residence by October were forced to cast provisional ballots, which are notorious for never being counted due to the strain it puts on the Supervisor of Elections office. Baxley’s law worked: Provisional ballots increased by an average of 25 percent in each county. Early vot-ing hours were also restricted, and students were among the many Democratic-leaning groups that were forced to wait in longer lines to vote, in some cases for more than an hour.
I find it appalling that elected representa-tives, name-ly Rep. Bax-ley and his Republican allies in Tal-
lahassee, think it’s OK to restrict our voting rights. Voting in a city where most of us live 10 months out of the year is not “stealing an election” — it is participating in our right to de-mocracy.
If you were one of the those stu-
dents who had to cast a provisional ballot or are as equally offended by Baxley and Jones’ attempts to limit our voting rights as I am, I encour -
age you to come out and vote in the mayor’s race on March 19. 
We have a stake in this election, 
and we deserve to have our voice heard and our votes counted.

Speaking Out
In the midst of all the anti-gun rhetoric being spewed 
from Capitol Hill, it is surprising to me that the per -
son leading the anti-gun charge is a woman.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), as many of you 
know, has been vehemently pushing for a resurrec-
tion of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban in yet another governmental attempt to lobotomize personal behavior, destroy property rights, disarm our citizenry and broaden gun control.
Usually, the pro-gun, anti-government, Tea Party-
esque arguments are aligned with the far right, lib-ertarians or market anarchists who are pigeonholed as Ron Paul-loving, Gadsden flag-flying types. But I think it’s time that women, especially women who identify themselves as feminists, jump on the pro-gun bandwagon.
According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National 
Network, one out of every six American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime.
Compare those numbers to the 3 percent of men 
who fall victim to sexual assault, and it becomes ap-parent who is committing sexual violence and who the victims are.Now, the reason why being 
anti-gun is equivalent to being anti-women is that disarming society, or even suggesting an 
increase of impediments when purchasing a firearm (waiting periods, increased background checks) is that, at worst, these measures disarm women and, at best, make it harder for women  to arm themselves.
Because women fall prey to sexual violence much 
more often than men, it can be argued that women, more than any other demographic, need access to the use of lethal force and self-defense. Although hypo-thetical — and hopefully only momentarily hypotheti-cal at that — imagine how disincentivizing rape and sexual assault would be if more women had access to and were encouraged to carry — or at least own — firearms.  
If feminists, and women in general, are serious 
about the rape epidemic, anti-woman politicians, such as Feinstein, should be abandoned by said constituen-cies.

Speaking Outuniversity plans to match the $15 million.
UF Student Body President Tj Villamil said 
the majority of the money will be spent on hir -
ing more faculty members.
“We will reduce the faculty-to-student ratio 
because that is one of the only metrics that we 
are not with our peers on,” he said. “That is the one thing we are lacking in.”Villamil, 23, said he believes the bonus will 
help make UF a top 10 school.
“I think we already are on the caliber of the 
top 10,” he said. “But we need the financial re-sources to really push us over the edge.”
Machen said UF will have to meet require-
ments for the next five years to receive the an-nual bonus.
“The governor has made it very clear that 
performance counts, and we like to play in a ballgame where performance really does mat-ter,” he said.
Machen added the governor’s interest in 
making UF a top 10 school was the reason he stayed president.
“It was an unbelievable moment,” he said. 
“I could not pass it up.”Among other budget plans, Scott said he 
wants to disperse $3.8 billion for public uni-versities and $1.1 billion for state colleges.
Although Scott selected UF for the $15 mil-
lion bonus, he said he would work with any state university that wanted to be in the top 10 nationally.
Scott said he made tough budgeting choices 
during the past two years, and now, he added, was time to make “smart” choices.
“This is just the beginning,” he said.  Stowers, a 19-year-old UF English and political science 
sophomore, has been in Catholic conversion classes since De-
cember.
She said she was surprised about Pope 
Benedict’s resignation.
“I’m a new Catholic, and I didn’t know 
that the pope could resign,” she said.
As of Monday night, official timetables 
for the conclave and voting process have not been announced.
Ruchinski said he, along with almost a bil-
lion other Catholics around the world, will 
have to wait for the election of the new pope.
“We’ll pray for the current pope, for his health and the ease 
of transition and for peace of mind as he takes this step,” he said. “And then, for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, that those who gather for the conclave can choose wisely and choose well.” KATHRYN VARN

An Arizona disc jockey left a fraternity 
party in an ambulance Saturday night after 
University Police reported he was too intoxi-cated to finish his performance.
David Joseph Lopez Jr., 21, also known as 
Luminox, was taken to Shands at UF from a Sigma Alpha Epsilon party, according to a UPD police report.
At about 9:30 p.m., UPD officers monitor -
ing the party called dispatch to report there was a “highly intoxicated person” at the event, according to the report.
When an additional officer arrived at the 
house, SAE president Alexander Barrett led the officer to the second-floor bathroom, where they found Lopez talking to paramed-ics.
Police reported that Lopez was “confused 
and disoriented” during his conversation with officials, according to the report.
Lopez’s manager, Miguel Alfonso Grana-
do, 22, told UPD Lopez was too intoxicated to finish his set and had to be escorted off-stage before he could finish, according to the report. An ambulance later took Lopez to the hospital for treatment.
The next day, Lopez tweeted that a girl 
had stuck a lollipop laced with drugs into his mouth before the event.
“My apologies for anybody who came to 
see me last night in Gainesville at the SAE court yard #roofied,” he wrote.
In an interview Monday night, Grana-
do said doctors believed Lopez had been drugged, citing that his blood alcohol con-tent was 0.05 percent.
However, Granado said doctors believe 
Lopez was drugged off-campus before head-ing to the SAE party.
Shands at UF personnel couldn’t be 
reached for comment to confirm Lopez and Granado’s claims.
In an email, Barrett said he did speak to 
Granado about Lopez and the incident.
“All necessary steps were taken to ensure 
[Lopez’s] health and safety,” he wrote. “The event was registered with the university, there were multiple police officers present per university guidelines and no other inci-dents took place.”
Lopez could not be reached for comment.Contact Kathryn Varn at kvarn@alligator.

To show how important Gator 
families are to the UF community, 
the Division of Student Affairs is hosting the first all-campus Family Weekend Feb. 22 through Feb. 24.
Family Weekend is a tradition 
at UF that is geared toward first-year students.
But because not all first-year stu-
dents are able to participate during their first Fall semester, Assistant Dean and Director of New Student and Family Programs Jaime Gres-ley said Spring would be a great time to open up the campus.
“We really value all our family 
members and want to make sure they have a chance to come back and have a designated weekend full of activities so that they can reconnect [with their kids], regard-less if their child is a first-year stu-dent or not,” Gresley said.
Family Weekend registration 
ends Feb. 18, and everyone who comes will receive a free Family Weekend beanie. 
About 400 student have already 
registered, and Gresley expects about 1,000 students in total.
Family Fest, the signature 
event, will be held Feb. 23 on the UVS Field and will include a large carnival with a 160-ft. zip line. The Campus Diplomats will be facilitat-ing many of the events and booths, said Campus Diplomat Executive Director Deanna Thornton, 21.
“[Spring Family Weekend] will 
be a lot larger [than the one in Fall],” the management junior said. “Come with an attitude to experi-ence a lot of different things. There are really cool events, like the zip line, that you never get to do.”
This is also a weekend full of 
sports, something families don’t get to experience in the Fall. 
Families can see men’s bas-
ketball, women’s tennis, lacrosse, gymnastics and baseball games.
Under the theme “Always Or -
ange, Forever Blue,” Gresley said the Division of Student Affairs is trying to get the message across that UF students are Gators “true and true.” 
In doing so, the event is also 
opened to graduate students.
“Being a Gator is a special ex-
perience, and there’s a lot of pride that typically goes along with that,” Gresley said. “We want to give them the chance to share that with their family members who play a big supporting role.”

Gators often report academic stressors like workload, time management
ties and the economy were also frequently named sources.
GatorWell Health Promotion Services specialist Sara 
Martin said although many of the major stress factors in the 
survey are similar to what she hears from students, it did not mention one major factor.
“The biggest stressors I hear from students are academ-
ic,” she said. “Sometimes it’s about the workload and learn-ing how to manage time, while sometimes it relates more to internal and external 
pressures students feel to be successful.”
Martin, who is also a wellness coach, 
said not all stress is bad, and sometimes it keeps people motivated.
“But it’s important to manage stress 
levels so they don’t affect daily life,” she said.Robinson said when he does feel stressed, it’s usually be-
cause of work, classes and other commitments competing for his time.
“When that happens, I try to take a step back and put 
things in order of importance,” he said.
Martin suggested stressed out students take advantage 
of GatorWell and other on-campus services.
“There are so many good, free resources at UF,” Martin 
said. “It’s important that students reach out.”StreSS , from page 1

In a college town like Gainesville, there’s a 
bar on every corner.
But Allen Hessell is convinced he can bring 
something new to the table.
Hessell is the owner and operator of The 
Brass Tap and is planning to open his new bar, 
located at 3833 SW Archer Road, Building B, Monday.
The Brass Tap, a craft-beer franchise that re-
cently merged with Beef ‘O’ Brady’s, has three other locations in Florida.
Hessell said he wanted to be a part of the 
chain after he went to a franchise exposition.
“The craft beer business is exploding right 
now,” he said. “I wanted to get in from the be-ginning because it’s so exciting.”
With about 250 bottles of beer and about 60 
different types of draft beer from all over the world in stock, Hessell said his bar will offer the most diverse beer drinking experience in the city.
Matt Martin, bartender and shift manager at 
the Brass Tap, said the bar’s menu will feature five types of beer from Swamp Head Brewery , as well as wine, cider and cigars.
Martin and Hessell said they both hope their 
diverse beer will attract customers with a range of beer tastes.
“It’s a place for craft beer drinkers to gather 
and convene,” Martin said. “There’s a lot to craft-beer drinking, and this is the place to find out about it.” TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Holocaust scholar Alan Rosen 
will be speaking at 7 p.m. Tuesday 
in Pugh Hall on UF’s campus.
The event, part of the Samuel 
Proctor Oral History Program, will stress the importance of the expe-riences Holocaust survivors faced in concentration camps, said Paul Ortiz, associate professor in his-tory and director of the history program.
“This event will ask us to think 
about the larger impact the Holo-caust will continue to have today,” Ortiz said.
Rosen has researched some of 
the earliest historical interviews conducted with Holocaust survi-vors. These interviews, conducted by David Boder 
following World War II, are de-tailed in Rosen’s book “The Won-der of Their Voices: The 1946 Holocaust Inter-views of David 
Boder.”
Rosen has a doctorate in litera-ture and religion from Boston Uni-versity, where he studied under renowned Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel, according to a press release.
Scott Kraff, a 22-year-old UF 
history and political science senior, has been involved with the history program research staff for a year.
Kraff works with the techni-
cal crew and helps with the setup of the programs provided by the Samuel Proctor Oral History Pro-gram.
“I think it’s a unique experience 
to go to,” Kraff said. “As a student of the Holocaust, it doesn’t get much better than this.”
The event will have free park-
ing, and there will also be a recep-tion and book signing after Rosen speaks.

Since becoming Kentucky’s coach in 2009, John Calipari has 
dominated Florida. 
Calipari owns a 7-1 record against Florida coach Billy Dono-
van. The Gators went 0-3 against the Wildcats last season as UK 
cruised to win a nation title. 
“That’s really embarrassing to lose to a team three times in 
one year,” junior point guard Scottie Wilbekin said. “It’s always going to be in the back of our minds … but it’s a new year, and we’ve got things that we’re focused on this year. That’s to win [a Southeastern Conference] championship. In order to do that, we’ve got to beat them.”
When No. 7 Florida (19-3, 9-1 SEC) hosts No. 25 Kentucky 
(17-6, 8-2 SEC) at 7 p.m. in O’Connell Center, the Gators will face a Wildcats squad with new faces. Seven members of Cali-pari’s championship team bolted to the NBA or graduated. 
“Their team is different from a year ago,” Donovan said. 
“We’re not preparing for Anthony Davis or (Michael) Kidd-Gilchrist or (Doron) Lamb or (Marquis) Teague. We’re prepar -
ing for Nerlens Noel and (Kyle) Wiltjer and (Alex) Poythress, some very gifted, talented guys who have their own identity and play their own way.”
Kentucky began the season on a sour note, losing three of its 
first seven contests while Florida started 7-0. But UK has won five straight games and is sitting only one game behind UF in the conference standings. 
Noel is the NCAA’s leading shot-blocker with 4.5 per game. 
As an enforcer in the paint, the 6-foot-10 Noel averages a near double-double in points (10.6) and rebounds (9.6). The fresh-man center is not a proficient scorer like Davis, the consensus National Player of the Year in 2012, but defends with similar intensity . 
“I think he is just as good as Anthony Davis as a shot

Florida’s coaching staff urged Chris-
tin Mercer to not become complacent 
following her best performance of the season against Alabama. 
Logging 23 minutes during UF’s 
87-54 victory on Feb. 3, the 6-foot freshman finished with 18 points on 9-of-12 shooting and pulled down 11 rebounds. Both were career-high num-bers. 
Mercer did not disappoint in her 
encore. 
In Florida’s 65-57 victory against 
Auburn — the Gators’ first win on the road against the Tigers since Feb. 29, 2004 — Mercer scored 12 points and grabbed nine rebounds. More impor -
tantly, she helped provide a spark for Florida’s stagnant first-half offense that scored just two points in the first 8:56 
of the game. 
“You see 
a kid that is showing the potential that 
is there that we have all been harping on and really getting on her about the whole season,” assistant coach David Lowery said. “Just being able to be consistent, I think that has been the most important thing that I’ve noticed from her.”Freshman achieving

Camilla Hedberg and the fifth-ranked 
Florida women’s golf team are in sec-
ond place after Round 1 of the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes, Calif.
After the first round of the tournament 
no team has shot below par, with the low-est being UCLA, which leads after shoot-ing 4 over par (288) in the first round.  Florida is currently tied for second with Duke at 6 over par (290).
The Gators are looking to capture their 
fourth victory of the season and sixth con-secutive individual title.
UF is facing stiff competition in the 
Grumman Challenge against some of the best teams in the nation, according to the rankings from Golfweek.com.
The challenge includes multiple teams 
in the top 10 such as No. 1 Washington, No. 3 USC, No. 4 Duke, and No. 7 Ari-zona.
“It’ll be another outstanding field for us and a good chance for us to see some of the west coast teams and play on their home turf,” coach Emily Bastel said in a release. “I think the win at the Florida Challenge got everyone excited to go tee it up again.”
UF hopes to continue its success after 
coming off of a win in the Florida Challenge. Mia Piccio, the No. 3 starter for the Grumman Challenge, is coming off an individual win at the Lady Bulldog Individual Championship.  
Isabelle Lendl, the 
only player besides Hed-
berg to start in all six tournaments this season, felt prepared for the course.
“I know we’re expecting fast greens,” 
Lendl said.
“The greens are always fast. There’s 
usually some good rough there. The course is always in great shape; it’s very hilly so I’ve been practicing a lot of high UF in second after first roundWOMEN’S GOLFSEE HOOPS, PAGE 14

about that. He has unbelievable length, has unbelievable timing. … He can alter shots from a lot of different direc-tions and areas on the floor. I think we have to have a level of intelligence, and I think driving in there and trying to shoot over top of him is probably not a wise choice. But I still think we are a team that needs to attack.”
Kentucky’s big men will test the rebounding and de-
fense of Florida’s frontcourt, which is already thin with ju-nior forward Will Yeguete out for 4-6 weeks after undergo-ing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. 
The Wildcats bring big men in Wiltjer and 7-foot center 
Willie Cauley-Stein off the bench. The pair average a com-bined 19.4 points and 10.1 rebounds per contest. 
The 6-foot-7 Poythress could provide a matchup prob-
lem for guards Mike Rosario and Michael Frazier II if he shifts to small forward. 
“Across the front line, they’ve got a lot of different line-
ups they can play,” Donovan said. “Our hand is what it is, in terms of our frontcourt.”
Wildcats guards Archie Goodwin and Ryan Harrow 
tend to take quick shots in the half court but thrive in tran-sition after forcing turnovers. Most of UK’s offense comes off ball screens and one-on-one penetration.
“They’re a good driving team,” senior guard Kenny 
Boynton said. “All of those guys, they get to the hole well. … We just have to stay in front of the ball.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2013

Ashanee Dickerson is rewriting Florida’s record 
books. 
Her name appeared among Gator greats 25 times com-
ing into this season.
She has not slowed since arriving to Gainesville, and 
she has not stalled in her quest for a national champion-
ship. 
“She just keeps getting better,” coach Rhonda Faehn 
said.
“And I love that she’s taking ownership of her senior 
year in a way that she is going to make sure that she leaves nothing on the table.”
By the end of the regular season, there may be nothing left for Dickerson to take.
Since her freshman year, Dickerson has competed in 
all-around 37 times in 42 events and has earned 16 career victories — good enough for a tie for fifth in program his-
tory. 
As a junior, she became the only Gator 
in the program’s 32-year history to score a 9.95 or above in each event.
She has neared perfection three times, 
and on Friday, Dickerson became the eighth Gator to post a 9.975 on floor. 
“Her floor routine, that was really the 
best,” Faehn said.
“I still get chills thinking about it … the best [routine] 
I’ve seen her do.”
Dickerson has increased inspiration this season.The arrival of freshman Bridget Sloan has only benefit-
ed Dickerson during the Jacksonville native’s final cam-paign as a Gator.
“I just need [Bridget] Sloan,” Dickerson said. “I need 
Bridget Sloan with me in the corner. She pumps me up every time.”
The emotion Sloan gets out of Dickerson is rare. Faehn 
joked that the only two words she heard from Dickerson as an underclassmen were, ‘Yes, m’am.’”
But Dickerson’s level-headed attitude keeps her 
grounded. Faehn appreciates what she has in the record breaking senior. 
“I still, every day, sit back and shake my head,” Faehn 
said.

collegiate gymnastics.”Senior gymnast enjoying successful final season as Gator

shots to greens, bump and runs, undulating putts and 
chip shots from the rough …. all you can do is play your best golf.”
Hedberg and Piccio are leading Florida after both 
posted an identical first round of 71 for even par. 
For Hedberg, a victory in the Grumman Challenge 
would be her fourth of the season and her second con-secutive in the spring.
Piccio is looking to continue her successful senior 
season after winning the aforementioned Bulldog Invi-tational and finishing tied for eighth at the Florida Chal-lenge. 
The three other Gator starters in the Grumman are 
junior transfer Elcin Ulu, Lendl and sophomore Anna Young. Lendl and Young tied for 19th after shooting a 3 over par 74.  
Ulu shot a team worst 79 (+8) to tie for 60th. Ulu has 
played sporadically this season and is continuing to slip since shooting a 69 in her first round of the spring at the Florida Challenge. 
The Gators are in prime position for another victory 
after the unexpected results of some of their competi-tion.
The top-ranked Huskies are currently tied for 13th, 
19 strokes behind Florida.
There are two more rounds left in the Grumman 
Challenge. The championship round is on Wednesday. woMeN’S Golf , from page 13Florida is 6 over parUF’s big men face

Mercer was again efficient offensively 
against the Tigers, making 6 of 9 attempts 
from the floor in 23 minutes.
She also recorded one steal in the 
game. 
The improved play has given her a 
renewed sense of confidence in her own abilities as well. 
“Having career highs and going back 
and having another high game and almost getting a double-double — I missed it by one rebound — it builds your confidence,” Mercer said.
“Just going out there and playing like 
you know what you can do.”
Mercer struggled during Florida’s five-
game losing streak in January. She shot just 36.7 percent from the floor during the stretch and often appeared out of sync on both ends of the floor. 
Her nadir came against Ole Miss on 
Jan. 24, the third game in UF’s skid.
Mercer logged just 8 minutes of action 
in the contest and finished with 0-of-3 shooting in an 88-81 overtime loss in the O’Connell Center.
However, coach Amanda Butler began 
to see a change in Mercer shortly after -
ward. 
Butler praised her freshman for work-
ing harder in practice to prepare for Ala-bama and inserted her into the starting lineup for just the fourth time of the sea-son against the Crimson Tide.
“(Mercer) has had some performances 
that made us confident about her being out there to set the tone,” Butler said after beating Alabama. 
As Mercer continues to fuel the Gators, 
she also augments the play of senior Jen-nifer George.
George, who is often double-teamed by 
opponents, has found more space to work with the focus not fully on her in the front-court.  
On Sunday, the pair combined for 23 
points, and the Gators outscored the Ti-gers 30-18 in the paint.  
“That’s what we need right now and is 
a big reason why, as of late, we are looking better and playing better,” George said.  “Teams can’t double up on me because they have to worry about her.” 
Florida’s coaching staff hopes it has 
found a go-to duo that can be counted on down the stretch this season.
“That’s one of the things that we have 
preached to Christin: ‘If you can come in here and be effective and do some things, that is going to free up a whole lot of things for Jennifer and make you a really, really big part of our offense,’” Lowery said.
“I think she has really bought into 
that.”

When Kelsey Stewart arrived 
at Florida, she was the No. 2 
softball recruit in the country. But when she stepped into the batter’s box for the first time on Friday afternoon, she was just an-other freshman trying to make a name for herself.
She succeeded.In her first five games as a 
Gator, Stewart hit .556 on 10 hits in 18 at-bats. Of those 10 hits, two were doubles, one was a triple and two left the park.
Stewart ended the weekend 
with an on-base plus slugging percentage of 1.730.
And when the ball stayed in 
the yard, Stewart made the most of her time on base. She stole five bases and scored 10 runs.
The Southeastern Conference 
recognized Stewart’s efforts, naming the freshman SEC Player of the Week.
“I’ve never had so much fun 
playing softball,” she said.
Stewart was one of six fresh-
men who took the field for the Gators at the Kajikawa Classic in Tempe, Ariz., this weekend.
Most of those six were major 
contributors to No. 14 Florida’s (5-0) dominant victories at the Classic.
Outfielder Kirsti Merritt fol-
lowed Stewart in the order and made some noise with her own bat.
Merritt had five hits and drew 
three walks for an on-base per -
centage of .526. She drove in six runs during the weekend, includ-ing four on a grand slam against Creighton (2-3) on Friday.
Merritt’s bases-loaded homer 
helped the Gators run-rule the Bluejays.
“One of the things that stood 
out to me is just the leadership that Kirsti Merritt showed in the outfield,” coach Tim Walton said.
First baseman Taylor Schwarz 
didn’t rack up as many hits as Stewart and Merritt, but when she did connect with the ball, she made the opposition pay.
Schwarz’s only two hits were 
home runs.
The first homer came in the 
fourth inning against No. 3 Cali-fornia (2-2) with Florida down 3-2. Schwarz’s two-run bomb gave the Gators a lead they did not relinquish.
The second came against No. 
13 Arizona (3-2) on Sunday. With Florida up 8-3, Schwarz started a six-run inning with a solo home run.
Senior Ensley Gammel fol-lowed Schwarz with a home run of her own, and the Gators went on to win 14-3.
Florida freshmen accounted 
for five of the Gators’ eight home runs, 11 of their 18 extra-base hits and 18 of their 26 RBIs.
“I don’t know if that’s going to 
continue,” Walton said.
“But … I think the competi-
tiveness at the plate was really good.
“If you compete like we did 
and swing at quality pitches, foul off some tough pitches, I think we’re going to be in position to hit home runs.”TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium. Walton got key production from UF’s freshmen at the Kajikawa Classic.
SOFTBALLFreshmen key in Florida’s undefeated start to season  Josh: The Gators lost the vast majority 
of their power to graduation and the draft. They don’t need to completely 
replace Mike Zunino, Preston Tucker and Nolan Fontana, but someone still has to step up and pick up some of the slack. That is why the most important player on the Florida baseball roster this season is soph-omore catcher Taylor Gushue. The lineup won’t be as power-reliant. Instead, UF will increase its focus on small ball. Still, the Gators will rely on Gushue’s raw power to give them some semblance of balance in a lineup that lacks home-run ability at several positions. Even though he hit just .206 as a freshman, Gushue showed his potential as a middle-of-the-order force in ﬂ  ashes early last year. 
  Adam: Every team needs an ace. Series 
are won on Friday nights. With the pow-er players at the plate gone from a year ago, pitching becomes more important for Florida. Kevin O’Sullivan had a three-run home run in his back pocket when things went awry last season. Say hello to stolen bases and bunts this season for the Gators’ bats. Junior Jonathon Crawford takes over as the Friday night starter. If he can’t last deep into games, relievers get used up for the weekend. With a team built on defense and pitching, Florida needs Crawford to set the tone for the weekend. For the pitch-er who doesn’t say much, Crawford will let his mid-90s fastball, plus-slider and improved changeup do the talking. And Florida will be much better off with that no matter how many RBIs Gushue gets.
  Josh: Without a doubt, pitching is impor-
tant. But pitchers need run support. You don’t need to belt 75 dingers like UF did last year to be successful. Arizona only hit 23 home runs last year and still won the College World Series. And while pitch-ing is more important when runs are at a premium, the Gators don’t have depth in the rotation beyond Karsten Whitson and Crawford to assume small ball will get it done. There are no established starters to take the Sunday and midweek jobs, and the Gators are likely going to have to put up runs in those games. Jona-thon Crawford won’t be on the ﬁ  eld then, but Gushue will. He has the most raw power of anyone in the lineup, and the Gators will need him to be a 10-15 home run guy as they only return 14 of their home runs from last year’s team.
  Adam: Where have you been this fall and 
spring? The Gators are built on pitching and defense. Power won’t be there for Florida. O’Sullivan and the players said it themselves. And anything can happen in 
the College World Series. The Gators were the best team on paper and they exited quietly with two straight losses last season. Arizona pitching held op-ponents to less than two runs per game in 
Omaha, which includes two wins against Florida State who ﬁ  nished tied for 13th in the nation in home runs.  What happens to Florida when its starting pitcher can’t go past the ﬁ  fth inning? Inexperienced arms make up the bullpen. Steven Rodriguez isn’t running through the outﬁ  eld wall’s door anytime soon. That means Crawford has to eat up innings if UF stands a chance in a weekend series. Gushue can smack all the home runs he wants, but without a rested bullpen, the opposition will easily outdo the sophomore catcher come Satur-day and Sunday when series are decided.
  Josh: Like you did in our Rally last week, 
you are making my point for me again. I’m aware they are built on pitching and defense. But Gushue also factors into the defensive equation. Mike Zunino was strong behind the plate for three years at Florida. Last season, he ranked second in conference in throwing runners out. UF needs Gushue to be somewhat comparable to Zunino defensively. Offensively, the Gators can’t expect him to be Zunino, but they need him to shoulder a large percent-age of the offensive burden — even if that is smaller than it has been in years past. Even if Crawford and Whitson are studs, they will start less than half of the team’s games, whereas Gushue is an everyday player. Florida will need offense more than anything on those occasions.
  Adam: How am I making your point? The 
problem here is you have no point. You’re saying Florida needs Gushue’s offense to replace what it lost last year. This isn’t the same UF offense! The Gators will not sur-vive the Southeastern Conference without consistent starting pitching. Sure, teams win by scoring runs, but Crawford gives Florida an advantage every time out. Ev-erything ties into how he pitches. If Craw-ford can’t eat up innings on Friday night, it will mess everything up in a weekend series. And as you mentioned earlier, Gushue hit .206 last season. He had a tre-mendous year considering he skipped his high school senior season to play at UF, but like the rest of Florida’s offense, there is still something to prove.
