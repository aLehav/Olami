Elizabeth Fechtel sat down with 
friends in the UF Levin College of 
Law and wrote down her deﬁ  nition of innovation.
“When I think of innovation, I 
think of things that are bright, new and unheard of before,” said the UF political science junior.
Fechtel, 20,  and about 50 other 
UF students gave feedback on the $10 million renovations coming to Newell Hall at a public forum hosted by Student Government on 
Thursday. The vacant building will 
be renovated into a learning space with an emphasis on group study.
Aileen Strickland, a designer for 
the project, divided students into groups of seven and had each of them deﬁ  ne the themes of Newell Hall’s renovation: innovation, ﬂ  ex-ibility and accessibility.
Designers hope to make Newell 
Hall innovative with equal access to technology, including computers and TVs with video conferencing capabilities, ﬂ  exible with portable tables and walls conducive to group studying, and accessible with com-fortable chairs and large tables.
“The most important part in the 
design process is you have to have a solid concept because it drives ev-erything,” Strickland said.
A student experience survey 
from 2011 revealed that students considered more study space as “the single most important thing” to im-prove their experiences.
“The goal is to create innovative 
and unique learning space that does not exist anywhere on campus,” said UF Student Body President Cory Yeffet.VOLUME 109 ISSUE 29 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG FRIDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2014

The UF Student Health 
Care Center will host its 
third annual Free Flu Shots 
outreach event today.
The event will take place 
on the front lawn of the 
SHCC building from 9 a.m. 
to 3 p.m.
Students will need to 
bring their Gator 1 Card to 
get vaccinated.
The ﬁ  rst 1,000 vaccinated 
students will receive free “SHOTS” tank tops and oth-er giveaways.
The SHCC plans to vac-
cinate as many students as possible before Thanksgiv-ing break. Today, the center hopes to distribute about 1,500 vaccinations.
Catherine A. Seemann, 
communications coordinator for the SHCC, said after the event, students can still walk 
in and get vaccinated.
“It draws more atten-
tion to ﬂ  u shot vaccinations, 
rather than just making an announcement that you can walk in at any time,” See-mann said.
The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention rec-ommend that everyone six months and older get the ﬂ  u vaccine annually.
UF sport management 
senior T.J. Endebrock, 21, said his mother and doctor remind him to get a ﬂ  u shot every year.
“The one year I didn’t get 
a shot, I got sick,” Endebrock said. “I just want to stay as healthy as possible each year and prevent any illness I 
can.”

mental health director for

The ﬁ  rst human case of West Nile Virus this year was con-
ﬁ  rmed in Alachua County this week.
The identity of the infected individual and the location of 
the infection were not released, said Anthony Dennis, environ-
mental health director for the Florida Department of Health in 
Alachua County. 
Dennis said he doesn’t expect the virus to be a problem in 
Gainesville because winter is approaching but still warned 
residents to take precautions.“We had a human case, so we try to raise everyone’s aware-
ness,” Dennis said. 
The department is urging people to drain garbage cans, gut-
ters, ﬂ  owerpots and any other places where water can collect.   
“It only takes a little bit of water to breed 100 mosquitoes,” 
Dennis said. Roberto Pereira, an associate research scientist with the UF 
entomology and nematology department, said people should wear repellent and long-sleeve clothing, close doors and win-
dows and avoid going outside at peak times — dusk and 
dawn. 
“One can minimize the chances of getting the virus if they 
follow these steps,” Pereira said. 
The symptoms of the virus include headaches, fever, dizzi-
ness, joint pain and fatigue, Dennis said. These could last two to 14 days after the initial bite. 
“With West Nile, you could get it and not even know it,” 
Dennis said.First case of West Nile Virus this year reported in Alachua County

Vinyl lovers can soon find 
Arrow’s Aim Records at a 
new location with triple the 
inventory.
The indie record store, lo-
cated at the corner of North-
west First Avenue, will set 
up shop in two weeks at 10 
N. Main St., where the F.L.A. Gallery used to be.
More than 20,000 records 
will be on sale starting Oct. 
15. The extra space will allow 
albums to be broken down by more specific genres, simpli-fying record hunting. 
“Making it a more com-
fortable and fulfilling shop-ping experience is kind of the point of expanding,” said Daniel Halal, the store’s own-
er. “Once we move, every-
thing will be out. It’ll be really easy to find stuff, making it a better experience overall.”
Halal, a 29-year-old 
Gainesville resident, said the 
store has been rising in popu-
larity since it opened in Sep-tember 2012. 
“We just didn’t really 
know how much of a demand there was, so we decided to start small and expand if we needed to,” Halal said. “And it just really took off a lot 
better than we ever thought 
it would, so it’s time to ex-pand.”The new location will pre-
serve the small shop’s retro charm with an all-white, 
20-foot ceiling lined with re-
cords, Halal said.
“I think the fact that 
they’re expanding shows how 
records are definitely coming 
back,” said Annaleigh Bonds, a 20-year-old UF public rela-tions junior.
Bonds said she has been 
collecting records since high school and looks forward to the new location.
“I almost think that the 
store’s expansion is going to speed up that trend in Gainesville because the more 
people who go into a record 
store, the more they want re-cords,” she said.
Halal said he will start 
packing up the current shop 
next week.
“I think what I’m inter-
ested in is cultivating the 
culture and environment of 
record buying in Gainesville 
and making that better,” he said. “It’s going to be a whole new store.”Downtown record

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
COLUMBUS, Ohio — A man 
who portrayed himself as a member 
of a wealthy Pakistani family and was often seen driving luxury cars, including a Ferrari, pleaded guilty 
Thursday to a multimillion-dollar 
investment scam involving three former Miami Heat players and the team itself.
The government alleges that 
Haider Zafar defrauded play-ers Mike Miller, James Jones and Rashard Lewis in 2013 by promising to invest millions in various busi-
ness opportunities. He also received 
a $1 million, three-season Heat ticket package he never paid for, accord-ing to the government.
Zafar pleaded guilty in fed-
eral court in Columbus to five wire fraud charges that each carry maxi-mum 20-year prison sentences. That case was consolidated with another against Zafar in Columbus, where 
the defendant previously pleaded 
guilty to swindling a Washington, D.C. businessman out of $10 million between 2008 and 2010.
Zafar, currently in Franklin 
County Jail, pleaded guilty to the 
Miami Heat allegations to accept 
responsibility and move forward 
with his life, his attorney, Sam Sha-
manksy, said Thursday.
Testimony by an FBI agent 
Thursday portrayed Zafar as a man 
who talked big as he persuaded the Heat players to give him millions of dollars for investments that never materialized.
Zafar boasted of $35 million in a 
Swiss bank account and luxury resi-dences in New York City and Miami and was often seen being chauf-feured in a yellow Ferrari, a white Bentley and a black Escalade, said 
FBI agent David Fine.
Zafar persuaded the Miami 
Heat’s vice president of sales to sell 
him a premium three-season ticket package for $1 million after explain-ing his “family history and influ-
ence,” including ownership of ho-
tels, companies and other business 
ventures, Fine said.
Zafar convinced Miller to give 
him $2.6 million, Lewis to give him $4 million and Jones to give him $1.5 million, all for an investment oppor-tunity that Zafar said would “quick-ly obtain a significant return.” But rather than reimburse the Miami Heat and three individuals, Zafar used the money himself.
Man found guilty in Miami Heat fraud “We just didn’t really 
know how much of a 
demand there was, 
so we decided to start 
small and expand if we 
needed to.”

� UF HOPES TO BE ZERO 
WASTE BY 2015.

The UF community contin-
ued to unload its groceries from 
reusable bags as California an-nounced a plastic bag ban. 
As the first state in the U.S. 
to officially prohibit stores from handing out free plastic shop-ping bags, California will put the ban into effect beginning in July 2015.
Although the act has not 
been brought into Florida law, student consumers are already beginning to replace plastic 
bags with reusable ones.
In Spring 2013, Gator Din-
ing Services implemented a 
program to remove plastic bags from its 45 Aramark-managed locations on campus, according to the Association for the Ad-vancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.
The on-campus Subway lo-
cations and Pollo Tropical all use paper bags instead of plas-tic bags. 
Campus-wide initiatives 
are well under way to increase student and faculty “green” awareness. UF students have long been reducing their plas-tic waste and substituting it with reusable bags that are eco-friendly.
Raquel Ruiz, a UF indus-
trial and systems engineering senior, said stores should begin to motivate customers to bring their own reusable bags.
“Personally, I have my own 
reusable bags because they are environmentally friendly, big 
enough so I only make one trip 
from my car to my house, and some of the bags are just really cute,” Ruiz, 21, said.  
According to the Florida 
Department of Environmen-tal Protection, no local or state government may enact any regulation or tax on the use of 
retail bags until the Legislature 
adopts recommendations from the department. 
UF’s Office of Sustainabil-
ity is urging students to take the sustainability effort even further by using secondhand or repurposed bags from thrift stores or yard sales instead of 
purchasing them new. 
Allison Vitt, outreach and 
communications coordinator 
at UF’s Office of Sustainability, wrote in an email that UF has prevented more than 16,000 plastic bags from entering the landfill each week.
“Most reusable totes are 
inexpensive, durable and can hold more items than typical grocery store plastic bags,” Vitt said. 
Vitt encourages students 
and faculty to continue on the path of sustainability beyond banning plastic bags.   Calif. bans plastic 
bags, UF moving in the same direction

A fight between cousins ended 
in an arrest, a gunshot and a broken 
TV early Thursday. 
Gainesville Police said Khiry D. 
Robinson, 23, and his cousin started 
fighting at about 3 a.m.  in their Lau-
rels Apartments unit at 4455 SW 34th St. Robinson reportedly punched his cousin several times in the head and body with a closed fist. 
Following the fight, police said 
Robinson grabbed his Glock 27 pis-tol from his room and fired a round into the wall out of anger. The bullet 
ripped through the wall and into the adjoining apartment, where it struck 
and shattered a TV, causing about $200 in damage. 
The neighbor 
was home during 
the incident.  
Following the 
gunshot, police said Robinson kicked in the door to his cousin’s room with a pis-tol in hand. His 
cousin jumped off of his balcony and ran away.
When GPD responded to re-
ports of someone being shot, the apartment was empty. The man, his cousin and their guests were both located on foot and in a vehicle exit-ing the complex, a report said. 
Officers found a small amount 
of blood, a bullet hole and an empty gun holster when they searched the apartment. The pistol and the bullet, 
which was lodged in the TV, were 
recovered. No one was injured. 
Robinson admitted to hitting his 
cousin with closed fists. 
Robinson was arrested on 
charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill, simple domestic battery, shoot-ing into an occupied dwelling and 
criminal mischief. Family fight escalates, ends in arrest

The newest name to know in the UF Col-
lege of Nursing, Jeannie Cimiotti is proud to 
join The Gator Nation.
Cimiotti has been named the College of 
Nursing Dorothy M. Smith endowed chair 
and co-director of UF’s Florida Blue Center 
for Health Care Access, Patient Safety and Quality Outcomes. 
She came to UF in July from Rutgers Uni-
versity College of Nursing as an associate professor and the executive director of the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nurs-ing. 
“It’s been very exciting,” Cimiotti said. 
“I’ve worked at a couple of other universities, but there is an enthusiasm at UF that I have never seen before. It’s The Gator Nation.”  
Tracy Wright, UF’s College of Nursing 
public relations director, said Cimiotti’s back-ground and research made her a good fit for the position.  
“Her research just falls in line with what 
we’re trying to do at the center,” Wright said.  
The Florida Blue Center will create pro-
grams to address the lack of affordable health care and employment shortages in the field as well as improve the delivery of high-quali-
ty care and access for patients in underserved 
areas, she said. 
Because of Florida’s geographic and eth-
nic disparities and older population, Cimiotti said there are a lot of people in need.
“We have to figure out how to help those 
people,” Cimiotti said. “So the Florida Blue Center has an obligation to do research that will help address the health care issues of people in Florida.” 
Cimiotti is working with co-director Arch 
“Chip” Mainous of UF’s College of Public Health and Health Professions to structure the center, including adding a quarterly lec-ture series that focuses on health care issues. The first one will be Tuesday. 
Wright said the colleges of nursing and 
public health are excited for the center to be the leader in this research. 
“With Dr. Cimiotti and Dr. Mainous in 
this position,” Wright said, “we’re confident that they can do that and really get this cen-ter to where it’s making an impact with its research.” Rutgers University professor joins UF College of Nursing
Alachua County will also have nasal vaccine starting Oct. 14
“This is the time of year where we start to see an in-
crease in flu illnesses,” Dennis said. “Therefore, we en-
courage everyone to get the shot because it’s been proven 
to prevent and minimize the illness.”
The Alachua County Health Department will partner 
with the Alachua Medical Reserve Corps and the SHCC to distribute the FluMist vaccine on campus this month.
The vaccine, which is sprayed through the nose, will 
be available at the GatorWell main office on Oct. 14, 16, 
28 and 30.According to the U.S. Department of Health and Hu-
man Services, the flu vaccine is the best protection against the flu, as well as the H1N1 virus that emerged and be-
came a pandemic in 2009.
“You can be contagious for seven days,” Seemann 
said. “A couple of the days you may not even have symp-
toms. The flu shot not only protects you. It protects those around you.”flu , from page 1“Her research just falls in line

The Peace Corps will ﬁ  nd a home at the UF 
International Center once again.
A recruiter from the volunteer program 
will arrive in January after a two-year hiatus. A contract between UF and the Peace Corps 
expired in 2012, according to UF Grants and Contracts Coordinator Nargiza Ludgate.
The recruiter has not been chosen yet, but 
UFIC is in the process of ﬁ  lling the position.
“We’re very excited and looking forward 
to reestablish this ofﬁ  ce,” Ludgate said.
The recruiter will give presentations to 
students interested in making a two-year com-mitment to the Peace Corps.
UF is one of the top providers of Peace Corps volunteers and wants to continue this tradition.
Gregory MacDonald directs a Master Inter-
national program that blends the Peace Corps and a master’s program together. A student would start a non-thesis master’s degree in plant science, and while they take classes, they apply to the Peace Corps.
“It does allow the student to gain in-depth 
experience,” MacDonald said.
“There are only a few so far, and a lot of that has to do with students who really aren’t sure of their career path, so rather than start a specialized graduate program, they opt for 
Peace Corps directly,” he added.
Tarone Thirawatananond, 20, said it’s nice 
for students to have the opportunity to con-
tribute in another country.
“They’re coming in for a great cause, and

The educational certiﬁ  cation 
program UFTeach is participat-
ing in an initiative to promote  science, technology, engineer-ing and mathematics in public 
schools. 
STEM TIPS, an online STEM 
instruction coaching platform, 
partnered with UFTeach over the summer. 
The STEM program, which 
began in November 2013, re-ceived a two-year $2 million grant from UF and the Florida 
Department of Education in 
2012 to create a research-based 
STEM system for students in 
the College of Education. 
More than 50 UFTeach stu-
dents, majoring in STEM ﬁ  elds 
and minoring in UFTeach, are 
using the online platform. 
Gloria Weber, a UFTeach 
mathematics teacher, said UFTeach began using the pro-gram to provide UFTeach stu-dents with STEM resources to use in their future classrooms. 
“We started to incorporate 
it into our courses so that our students could use it for lessons and planning resources that are 
available there,” Weber said. 
“They also have something that allows us to have our students videotape their lessons and do an analysis of their lessons by watching themselves on video-tape.”
STEM TIPS is being shared 
with about 18 public school dis-
tricts in Florida to better serve 
teachers looking to implement STEM learning in classrooms.
The program also provides 
support for educators to con-nect and socialize with other STEM teachers outside their public school districts. Jason Arnold, who worked to create 
the STEM website, said some 
teachers need help promoting STEM ﬁ  elds at their schools. 
“In Florida, that is not un-
common,” he said. “There are 67 counties, and in a majority of them, there are teachers who are completely without a sup-port system in their content 
area.”
Weber said UFTeach is 
working on incorporating the 
program into the curriculum. 
“We haven’t had as much 
opportunity as we would like to be able to explore things, but there is some good stuff there, and we’re happy that we have 
access to some of the resources 
STEM TIPS provides,” she said.
Sarah Cimino, an 18-year-
old UF biology freshman, said this program is great for help-ing new teachers because she remembers the bad experiences she had with math teachers.
“I think math is something 
that needs a good teacher, and putting more time and effort into it will deﬁ  nitely help,” said Cimino. UFTeach and STEM

Trick or doggy treat?
Alachua County Animal Ser-
vices is hosting six Halloween events this month under the theme “Furry Tails Need Fairy Tale End-
ings.”
Dory Rosati, the shelter’s adop-
tion coordinator, said Saturday’s 
kickoff event from 3 to 5 p.m. hopes to match prospective own-ers with their “Prince Charming” pup.
“An adopter gets to move along, 
looking at dogs in a speed-dating 
style,” she said. “It’s our way of 
showcasing our long-term resi-dents that just get overlooked.”
On Tuesday, the shelter will 
celebrate the end of the Rachael Ray $100K Challenge, a summer-long adoption competition spon-sored by the ASPCA.
“As of now, we’re at 1,448 lives 
saved,” Rosati said. “We think we’re in second place, but we’ll know ofﬁ  cially where we stand and the ﬁ  nal count Tuesday.”
The shelter will also have an-other adoption event Oct. 25 from 2 to 4 p.m. at EarthWise Pet Sup-ply at 4106 NW 16th Blvd.
EarthWise owner Jeri Banta 
said his store partners with dif-ferent shelters each month to host adoptions. 
“Animal Services gets overrun 
sometimes with animals that they 
really need to try to ﬁ  nd homes 
for,” he said. “The goal is always to make it a no-kill area in Alachua County.”
The last event of “Furry Tails 
Need Fairy Tale Endings” is a dog-gy trick or treat.  Owners can stop by the agency on Halloween be-tween 9:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. with 
their costumed pets for a treat. Halloween adoptions at animal shelter

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The comptroller of the athletic 
booster organization at Florida State University remained in 
jail Thursday, accused of misappropriating between $500,000 
and $700,000.
Sanford Lovingood turned himself in to the Leon County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce on Wednesday. He is charged with ﬁ  rst-degree 
grand theft of over $100,000. The bond amount is listed at 
$25,000.
Lovingood told police he had been stealing money from the organization since 2011, according to the arrest afﬁ  davit writ-
ten by ofﬁ  cer Jared Lee.
Seminole Boosters Senior Vice President Jerry Kutz said 
Lovingood was a 35-year employee and once held the title of chief ﬁ  nancial ofﬁ  cer. The two were friends for 33 years, even before Kutz began working with the organization.
“Surprised is an understatement,” Kutz said. “It just seems 
so out of character. We’re all stunned.”
Lovingood said he had access to a Morgan Stanley account 
in which stock donations are made to the booster organization and then sold and turned into cash. He wrote checks from the account to the Schooner Development Co.
Lovingood told police that he used the 
stolen money to pay for his own investments 
and personal expenses.
According to the afﬁ  davit, Lovingood 
said he understood that he could not repay 
the money during his lifetime and thought he could repay it by willing property to the 
booster organization upon his death.

cox and the athletic department had no additional comment.FSU booster club ofﬁ  cial accused of grand theft up to $700KPeace Corps recruiter to return to UF International Center“An adopter gets to move

Darts & LaurelsGov. Rick Scott is in a tough re-election ﬁ  ght with Dem-
ocratic nominee Charlie Crist. The incumbent gover-nor has consistently struggled to gain signiﬁ  cant sup-
port among female voters. The College Republican National Committee decided to try to reverse this trend by releasing 
what might be the most bizarre ad of the campaign season so 
far. The ad, a parody of TLC’s reality series “Say Yes to the Dress,” features a young woman choosing between two wed-ding dresses, the stylish “Rick Scott” and the old-fashioned “Charlie Crist.” Apparently, Republicans think the best way to reach these voters is to demean them by portraying them as superﬁ  cial and obsessed with fashion. An even-more-out-
of-touch-than-we-thought DART to Gov. Rick Scott and the 
College Republican National Committee.
The NFL has been a hotbed of disgrace and controversy 
lately. The domestic violence incidents involving players Ray Rice, Greg Hardy and Jonathan Dwyer, and the league’s subsequent actions have cast a dark shadow over its reputa-tion. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson decided to take action on this serious and troubling issue by launching the “Pass the Peace” campaign this week. The campaign is partnering with Wilson’s Why Not You Foundation to pro-mote awareness of domestic violence and raise funds for the 
National Domestic Violence Hotline. It’s refreshing to see an 
NFL player on the right side of this issue for a change. We’re giving a setting-an-example LAUREL to Russell Wilson.
The New York Post has long been known as one of the 
most sensationalist and least credible print publications in the U.S. In 2013, after the Boston Marathon bombings, the Post put a picture of two men on the newspaper’s front page and claimed they were being sought by law enforcement in con-nection with the attack. That assertion was almost immediate-
ly proven to be false. The Post reached a new low this week 
with its headline about the birth of Chelsea Clinton’s daugh-ter, the granddaughter of Bill and Hillary. “Party Pooper,” the headline read, with the subhead: “Another liberal crybaby for Dem Clintons.” Insulting a baby repeatedly within a day of its birth? That’s the kind of quality journalism we’ve come to expect from the Post. A you’re-not-even-trying-anymore

Religious scholar Reza Aslan ﬁ  rst came to national promi-
nence after an appearance on Fox News. Aslan demolished anchor Lauren Green’s argument that, as a Muslim, he had no credibility writing about the life of Jesus in his book “Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth.” Now, Aslan has done it again. In an appearance on CNN, he calmly and intel-ligently eviscerated the media’s portrayal of all Muslim coun-tries as uniformly primitive and oppressive. “To say Muslim countries, as though Pakistan and Turkey are the same … it’s frankly, and I use this word seriously, stupid!” he said during 
the interview. Even if you disagree with Aslan’s points about 
Islam, his commitment to nuanced and reasoned arguments is something the American media could use much more of. We’re giving a putting-the-media-in-its-place LAUREL to 
Reza Aslan.
Secret Service needs new vision, leadership
The Secret Service has a storied history of prevent-ing assassination attempts on the president and the First Family.
However, the once-proud agency’s responses to re-
cent White House breaches represent a massive institu-
tional failure.
Since 2011, there have been two serious attacks on 
the White House. In November 2011, Oscar Ortega-Her-
nandez pulled up to the front gate of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., aimed and ﬁ  red a semi-automatic riﬂ  e at the White House. Then he ﬂ  ed the scene after striking the building seven times. The Obama’s daughter Sasha and Michelle Obama’s mother, Marian Robinson, were home, and Ma-lia was on her way.
Even more troubling than the shooting attempt itself 
was the response of the Secret Service to the incident. Af-ter shots were ﬁ  red, on-duty Secret Service agents were told by their commanding ofﬁ  cer to stand down because the sounds were believed to be coming from a construc-tion car backﬁ  ring. Commanding ofﬁ  cers later conclud-ed the shots came from gangsters shooting at each other near the property.
The Secret Service leadership never interviewed 
agents who were on duty during the shooting. It took a housekeeper ﬁ  nding a broken White House window for agents to investigate further. The Secret Service then took four more days to connect the evidence to the shooter.
On Sept. 19, Omar Gonzalez jumped the White House 
fence, ran across the lawn, opened the front door to the Entrance Hall and was ﬁ  nally apprehended in the East Room. He happened to pass by the ﬂ  ight of stairs leading up to the First Family’s living quarters.
Thankfully, none of them were home at the time. It 
is alarming Gonzalez was able to enter the White House through the front door, overpower an agent and sprint through the 80-foot-long East Room, all while carrying a knife.
The failures of the Secret Service were magniﬁ  ed by 
bipartisan congressional outrage when members of Con-gress grilled the agency’s director, Julia Pierson, at a hearing. 
After the hearings, even more 
troubling information about the Gonzalez incident surfaced. The agent who tackled and ap-
prehended Gonzalez turned 
out to be an off-duty agent who happened to be strolling by the entrance. There was no agent as-signed to guard the front door, 
and the surrounding guards were not alerted because the alarm box was muted.
To say that the Secret Service dropped the ball would 
be an understatement. All these astounding mistakes 
demonstrate the need for additional scrutiny of the agen-
cy’s protocols and operations.
On Wednesday, Pierson did the right thing and of-
fered her resignation. However, the commanding ofﬁ  cers of the Secret Service should lose their jobs as well.
The White House is usually considered to be one of 
the most secure buildings in the country. There is no rea-son why someone should be able to ﬁ  re gunshots at the presidential residence.
There is no excuse for an unauthorized person to be 
able to inﬁ  ltrate the White House through the front door. Regardless of your political leaning, the president de-serves protection, and the Secret Service is obligated to provide that security.
An assassination attempt on the president would not 
only be a devastating national trauma but also send a dangerous message that America is no longer even able to protect its political leaders.
Clearly, the Secret Service is in dire need of new and 
effective leadership. The agency’s new leader must be tasked with maintaining a top-notch security team that would impress the Avengers or the Justice League. As the leader of the free world, the president requires noth-ing less.

At the end of the fairy 
tale, Cinderella lives 
happily ever after. 
Why wouldn’t Tinderella as well?
A column from last week 
detailed all the things wrong 
with Tinder, ultimately label-ing it a lazy dating app.
The author’s argument was 
that Tinder is “creepy, point-
less and potentially trashy.” 
She said it promotes superﬁ  -cial dating and the “stereotyp-
ical sleazy, college hook-up scene.”
You might not use Tinder 
personally, or approve of ca-sual hook ups in general, but those are some unnecessarily 
harsh words.
Honestly, how is picking 
up partners on Tinder any dif-ferent from picking up part-
ners at a bar?
Sure, you don’t physically 
swipe left or right on someone in public, but there’s still a similar inner dialogue:
“Oh, that person’s hot.”
“She’s not my type.”“I wonder what he’d look 
like naked.”
Like it or not, a lot of dat-
ing is based on appearances and ﬁ  rst impressions. You 
ﬁ  nd a person attractive, so 
you approach them and then see where it leads.
No one sits at a bar and 
points out someone to their 
friends with the comment, 
“Dang, that girl looks like 
she’s got a great personality.”
While I’d like to think that 
people swipe me to the right 
because of my highly enter-taining four-sentence Tinder 
bio, that’s probably not the 
case.
Unfortunately, you can’t 
tell much about someone’s 
personality until you talk to 
them, and in the dating world, you’re most likely to talk to 
someone whom you ﬁ  nd at-
tractive.
Tinder just simpliﬁ  es this.As such, you can’t criticize 
Tinder without criticizing dat-ing in general.
The only big difference 
that I can ﬁ  nd between the two is that Tinder users are a 
little more forward. No one has come up to me at a bar, 
or anywhere in public for that matter, and asked, “Sit on my face?”
There’s nothing wrong with 
being a little forward, though, especially on a known hookup app. It confuses me as to why 
some people are scandalized by this aspect of Tinder.
Someone asked you to 
hook up on an app speciﬁ  cal-ly designed to facilitate hook-
ups? The shock. The horror. How could anyone have seen 
this coming?
Sure, I got a few hypersex-
ual messages. Someone asked 
me, “Chipotle and f**k?” An-
other simply sent “Dtf?” Ad-
mittedly, these are probably things I wouldn’t be asked — 
at least during our ﬁ  rst con-
versation — in a real-life dat-
ing scenario.
But the majority of my con-
versations on Tinder were nor-mal. We talked about classes, 
where we were going out that night and what we like to do 
in our free time.
Most of the time, it wasn’t 
creepy, and it wasn’t sleazy.
In many ways, it was ac-
tually a lot less creepy than meeting someone in person. 
There’s no “unmatch” button 
in real life. If someone gets 
too forward with me, I either 
have to suck it up or leave the 
venue.
Tinder gives you full con-
trol. You pick who you swipe 
right on. You pick who you 
talk to. You pick who you meet up with, or even if you 
meet up at all.
The author of last week’s 
column said Tinder “will 
not satisfy any user looking for quality dates or relation-
ships.”
But I don’t think that’s 
what a majority of Tinder us-
ers are looking for.
Without sharing too much, 
I’ve met up with exactly one 
person from Tinder, and it 
wasn’t because I was inter-
ested in dating them.
My experience with Tin-
der ended up being really 
positive, though. I had a good 
time, and I got exactly what I 
wanted out of it. It was fun. It was easier and just as fun as 
meeting someone in person.
If you’re one of those peo-
ple who has “not looking to 
hook up” or “I’m just on here to talk to new people” in your 
about me section, then yeah, you’re probably not going to 
get the most out of Tinder.
But if you use it for its in-
tended purpose, Tinder can be a helpful app.
And if you yourself are a 
Tinderella, good luck in ﬁ  nd-ing your Prince Charming — 
even if it’s just for a night.

opinions@alligator.orgHumans are wired to cling 
tenaciously to their be-liefs. 
Regardless of how delusional 
they may be, these beliefs tend to 
automatically make humans dis-miss any conﬂ  icting evidence. 
In areas like politics and reli-
gion, this tendency is especially true. 
As a skeptic of organized re-
ligion, and as someone who falls closer to the atheism end of the be-lief spectrum, understanding the other side can be difﬁ  cult for me.
At ﬁ  rst, my own religious ig-
norance hindered my ability to 
truly explore the religious per-spectives of others. 
My ignorance stemmed largely 
from the common problem all ig-norant people have: a total lack of knowledge of the history, scrip-ture and culture of a religion. 
This realization took an enor-
mous toll on my self-perception. Up to this point, I had prided myself on just how open-minded and unbiased I thought I was. 
If anything, I was being more 
unfair and biased than even the most religious zealot: I was not only dismissing conﬂ  icting evi-dence but also unaware of what 
the evidence was.
In a genuine endeavor to dis-
pel my ignorance, I decided to 
make a change and educate my-
self. 
An idea I had was to interact 
and initiate meaningful conver-
sation with those who fall out-side my beliefs. 
This idea in practice, however, 
was always stymied the moment I “outed” myself as an atheist, and I frequently experienced what I 
can only label as a stigma against atheists. 
What started as a constructive 
and insightful conversation on 
topics such as God, belief, spiri-tuality or faith, quickly turned tense, austere and sometimes hostile once I uttered the word 
atheist. 
After my irreligiosity was 
made known, most of those I 
talked to declined to continue 
our conversation, accused me of 
solely being interested in attack-ing their God and beliefs and treated me like I was about to drag them down to intellectual 
hell with me. 
Others brashly laughed at my 
personal beliefs and blatantly 
accused me of acting too smart 
or too good for God, something 
I would later deeply regret, ac-cording to them. 
Yet for me, the most poignant 
response was the “tsk-tsk” and 
the true pang of sorrow in some-
one’s voice when they would tell me, “You must be so unhappy without God.”
The stigma about atheists 
shouldn’t come as a surprise to me. According to a Pew Research Center study, “How Americans Feel About Religious Groups,” 
on a scale of one to 100 — with 
one being the most negative — atheists were ranked at 41. 
Jews, Catholics and Evangeli-
cal Christians ranked at the top. Additionally, atheists were con-sistently ranked at the bottom and were overall perceived much more negatively by other reli-gious groups in this survey.
Surprisingly, while 59 percent 
of those polled said they knew 
someone who was atheist, only 
two percent identiﬁ  ed as such. 
This ﬁ  gure is illustrative of 
how real the stigma is. 
It seems that on a personal lev-
el, such as casual conversations with friends and family, people are comfortable identifying as atheists. 
However, it seems clear that 
atheists resist identifying them-selves on a quantitative and large-scale level.
 Somewhere between the mi-
cro and macro presence of athe-ism, this overwhelming stigma shrouds atheists and prevents accurate representation, in turn, 
fueling the stigma. 
It is impossible to create and 
sustain meaningful religious co-
existence and intellectual free-
dom when only popular interests 
— in this case, the interests of the most dominant beliefs — are rep-resented in society.
Something incredible happens 
to us when we allow our psyche to soften. We become permeable to another’s experience in the world. 
This allows people to create a 
space where differences are ex-plored and questioned. 
More importantly, stigmas can 
be thoroughly absolved and cor-
rected in this space, which creates 
a profound understanding of the universe and our place in it.

NEWARK, N.J. — The mar-
ried stars of “The Real House-
wives of New Jersey” are trad-ing the drama of reality TV for prison.
Teresa Giudice was sen-
tenced Thursday in U.S. District Court to 15 months in prison on conspiracy and bankruptcy fraud charges while her hus-band, Giuseppe “Joe” Giudice, was sentenced to 41 months by a judge who castigated them for failing to disclose all their 
assets yet gave both a measure 
of leniency.
In a nod to the couple’s four 
young daughters, Judge Esther Salas staggered the sentences so that Teresa will serve her sentence ﬁ  rst. She is scheduled to report to prison in January.
Teresa Giudice, 42, cried as 
she apologized in court before her sentencing.
“I fully take responsibil-
ity for my actions,” she said. “I need to learn to take responsi-bility for myself.”
Joe Giudice, 42, also apolo-
gized and said he had dis-graced many people. He faces an immigration hearing when he completes his sentence and will likely be deported. His at-torney said he came to the U.S. as an infant and didn’t know he wasn’t an American citizen un-
til he was an adult.
A spokeswoman for NBCU-
niversal, which produces “The 
Real Housewives,” declined to comment on the Giudices’ posi-tion with the show.‘Real Housewives’

The new sexual consent app 
Good2Go has been gaining popu-
larity at a rapid speed, but UF stu-dents and staff are skeptical.
The free app allows users to cre-
ate accounts with a phone number and password. It then sends a text to the person’s phone. When the 
person conﬁ  rms the text, they’re 
asked whether or not they’re “Good2Go” for sex.
Users are then reminded that 
“yes” can be changed to “no” at any time.
Rita Lawrence,  the GatorWell 
interpersonal violence prevention coordinator, said there are many problems with the app, but the main issue is that it replaces spo-ken communication.
She said students should have 
“face-to-face, in the moment, on-
going, respectful, honest, sober 
communication.”
People should constantly be ac-
knowledging their partner’s com-fort levels, Lawrence said.
She said another problem with 
the app is that it could potentially be used in court for a sexual as-sault case.
Stacy Scott, public defender for 
the Eighth Judicial Circuit, includ-ing Alachua County, said the app would be like any other technolo-gy-related evidence in court.
It would be similar to how they 
treat Facebook posts in court, she 
said.
The court would establish what 
the person said and get proof, like 
a phone number, and leave it to the jury to determine whether the evi-dence is authentic or not.
“If she changes her mind, the jury can hear that, too,” she said.
Julissa Nunez, the program as-
sistant for UF materials science and engineering, said she thought the app was a good idea but that no one would use it.
“If you were ‘good to go,’ I don’t 
think people in the moment would use it,” the 26-year-old said.
Though the creator of the app, 
Lee Ann Allman, compared using the app to putting on a condom on her website, Nunez said she dis-agreed.
Alex Bottone, a UF criminology 
senior, said he would use the app and thinks it’s still beneﬁ  cial de-spite its setbacks.
“I’d deﬁ  nitely use it,” Bottone, 
21, said. “Any kind of step in that direction is a good one.”
“Now whether that’s to be de-
veloped, there are still going to be people who abuse it, who don’t use it honestly, but it’s at least a step,” 
he added. “It’s a statement, and it’s 
a step in the right direction.”
Rather than using the app, 
Lawrence suggested students that should look at GatorWell’s online resources or attend a presentation on consent.

Students scanned Turlington Plaza for hid-
den cash as part of a ClusterFlunk event Thurs-
day. 
The company hosted two events this week 
to promote its upcoming app release. 
ClusterFlunk, an online platform where stu-
dents can connect with classmates and share 
notes, will soon launch its iPhone app. 
Students can sign up to ClusterFlunk using 
their university email address, add their class-
es to be connected to peers and have access to shared class materials. 
Aaron  Schwartz, a UF finance junior, is the 
campus manager for the academic social media platform.
Schwartz, 20, said ClusterFlunk is gaining 
speed at UF. 
Last week, the website gained 214 users, and 
membership at UF stands at 3,009.
“We’ve been really booming,” Schwartz 
said. “It’s really, really picking up traction fast. 
I’m really excited.”
ClusterFlunk was created by AJ Nelson, 22, 
who dropped out of the University of Iowa to 
focus on the website’s development. 
He founded the company in the winter 
of 2011 and launched the website in January 2013. 
Nelson is now the CEO and co-founder of 
ClusterFlunk, which has about 52,000 users at 
15 universities, he said.Jack Bryant, a 20-year-old UF mechanical 
engineering junior, said the network is a use-
ful tool for his classes, but he has not met any 
classmates through ClusterFlunk yet. 
He mainly uses shared review material for 
exams.
If students don’t share their notes, then the 
idea fails, Schwartz said. 
ClusterFlunk covers mainly entry-level 
classes.
The popularity of  the website in Gainesville 
is only a small portion of the platform’s suc-cess, Schwartz said. 
In ClusterFlunk’s semester-closing polls, 65 
percent of users said the company improved 
their grades, and 38 percent said they met at 
least one friend through the network.
Lightbank, an organization that specializes 
in investment in technology companies, an-
nounced in July that it would invest $1 million in ClusterFlunk. Groupon also contributed to 
the first funding round, Schwartz said. 
The website is usually funded by advertise-
ments, Nelson said.
Nelson said he and co-founder Joe Dallago 
care about mainly two things: getting students 
better grades and creating a social experience they would otherwise not have had access to.
“If we can keep doing those two things, giv-
ing kids a chance to learn more, learn better and 
get better grades and make friends in real life,” 
Nelson said, “you know, those are two pretty powerful things.”FRIDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

� IT’S CALLED SPORTODY.
SARAH HERNANDEZ 
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Roger Catchpole tried to 
book a scuba-diving excursion for 
his honeymoon two years ago, the process was frustrating. 
The UF alumnus went through 
the routine letdowns: unanswered emails, contact information that was no longer in service and user reviews that seemed so overwhelm-ingly positive they couldn’t be real.
“I realized there could be a bet-
ter way of doing this,” he said. “I wanted to build a platform where information could be easily shared so people knew where to go and en-joy sports.”
Catchpole created Sportody in 
November. The local startup, housed in Sun Center West in Gainesville, provides a platform for adventur-
ers to efficiently interact with local 
sports providers.
Adventurers are free to use the 
platform to search, review and book services from nearly 70,000 busi-nesses in 100 countries, covering more than 120 outdoor sports activi-ties.
“There are places in Gainesville 
that I didn’t even know existed that we have on the website,” said Mat-thew Edwards, Sportody’s 22-year-old director of human resources and marketing intern. 
“Their profiles are just currently 
run by us right now and not the pro-viders,” said Edwards, a fifth-year UF marketing senior. “The idea is that businesses are eventually going 
to claim their profiles and go on to 
add content themselves.“
Although Sportody’s services are 
free, businesses can pay a monthly subscription to supplement current services and boost advertisements. 
“The majority of these providers 
aren’t necessarily larger businesses,” Catchpole said. “They may be medi-
um-sized businesses that perhaps 
don’t have marketing teams.”
Catchpole said the site offers sports providers an innovative and cost-effective way to reach a wider 
market. The goal of the site is to 
streamline the customer experience by offering a third-party tool to book reservations, enabling providers to reduce administrative costs. 
The original website offered ba-
sic functionality, but Catchpole and Sportody’s team members will un-veil a new site on Oct. 14. 
Colby Cashion, a UF economics 
junior, said he believes Sportody could be a great resource for people who are trying to be more active.
“I really like the concept,” said 
Cashion, 20. “I can’t think of any other service that provides a hub of local outdoor sports like that.”
Catchpole said Sportody plans 
to expand its services by creating applications for iOS and Android devices by the end of the year. The platform will enable adventurers to use their phones to locate immediate 
resources.
“It’s an exciting time for our busi-
ness,” he said.

� IT ANNOUNCED 11 CASES.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Did retailer 
Abercrombie & Fitch discriminate 
against a Muslim woman who was denied a job because her headscarf clashed with the company’s dress 
code?
That’s the question in one of the 
11 cases the Supreme Court said 
Thursday it will take on in its new term.
The justices took no action on the highly anticipated issue of same-sex marriage, though a decision on the marriage equality cases could come later this month.
Among the new cases, the court 
will consider the scope of hous-ing discrimination laws, the First Amendment rights of judicial candi-dates to raise campaign money and a challenge from Arizona Republi-cans over who can draw the state’s congressional districts.
In the Abercrombie & Fitch dis-
pute, the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission sued the retailer after it refused to hire Samantha 
Elauf at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, store in 2008 because her Muslim hijab conflicted with the company’s “look policy.” The policy was described at 
the time as a “classic East Coast col-
legiate style.”
A federal judge initially sided 
with the EEOC, but the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, saying Elauf never directly informed her interviewer she needed a reli-gious accommodation, even though she was wearing the headscarf dur-
ing her interview.Government lawyers say the ap-
peals court ruling undercuts legal 
protections for religious practices because it unfairly places the entire burden to raise the issue with job ap-
plicants who often aren’t aware of a 
potential conflict.
Abercrombie & Fitch, which has 
faced slumping sales and could face negative publicity in the case, has pressed on with its defense, saying it was Elauf’s obligation to explain any special needs based on her religion.
Abercrombie & Fitch has settled 
two other EEOC discrimination lawsuits over the same issue, and it changed its “look policy” four years ago to allow its workers to wear hi-jabs. The company did not immedi-ately respond to a request for com-
ment.
The housing discrimination case 
is the third time in recent years that 
the Supreme Court has considered a challenge to the legal theory known as disparate impact. The strategy uses statistics to show that certain policies can harm racial minorities, even when there is no intent to dis-
criminate.

Matt Jones remembers his first trip to Knox-
ville, Tenn., to take on the Volunteers in 2012. It 
was his first career start and his second trip on the road with the Gators.
He probably wants to forget his first play, 
though.
“It was great, but for the first play I pitched 
the ball to (Andre) Debose — we had ran a reverse and he fumbled the ball,” Jones said. “And then it was like crazy, and then it got louder as it went.” 
Despite Jones getting the start, Florida chose 
to ride Mike Gillislee and Trey Burton in the run game. The duo combined for 206 yards on 
the ground, 80 of which came from Burton’s 
third-quarter touchdown run that tied the game at 20-20 with a little more than 18 min-utes to play. 
Jones finished with five rush attempts 
against Tennessee, gaining just 9 yards on five rushing attempts.
But heading into Saturday’s contest between 
Florida (2-1, 1-1 Southeastern Conference) and 
Tennessee (2-2, 0-1 SEC), Jones looks to be a 
bigger factor for the Gators.“I’ve definitely matured a lot from that mo-
ment,” said Jones, now a junior. “When I was a freshman I didn’t read the holes right. I’ve definitely matured running the ball, pass pro-tections and catching the ball. So I kind of grew up now.” 
What was once a great rivalry has been 
extremely one-sided as of late. Florida is on a nine-game win streak against Tennessee, win-
ning by an average margin of 15.3 points.
And while Florida is coming off a 21-point 
loss to Alabama, coach Will Muschamp said UF 
is ready for its second road game of the season.
“I think we’re confident,” Muschamp said. 
“I think that we’ve had good prep in the open week and I think we’ve had good preparation through this week and your preparation builds confidence in what you do. … It’s obvious a 
lot of negativity surrounds us here. I think our 
guys have seen that and understand the type of football team we can have when we put it together and that’s what we’re looking forward to.’’
Muschamp said on Monday that he wants 
to incorporate more of the run game into the offense, and that will start with Jones. The ju-nior is pacing Florida’s running backs with 258 
yards.“He’s just the best leader in the running 
back position,” center Max Garcia said. “You 
know, just with how hard he works now and him making good decisions when he decides to hit the hole and things like that... I feel like he’s been doing a really good job. He’s been a leader out there.”
With Jones beginning to separate himself 
in the backfield as Florida’s go-to back, sopho-more Kelvin Taylor has been used sparingly since SEC play began.
After rushing for 68 yards and two touch-
downs in Florida’s season opener against East-ern Michigan, Taylor has been limited to 19 rush attempts in UF’s past two games — less than half of the workload Jones has.
“Kelvin is still coming along. He’s a great 
back,” Jones said. “I mean, we’re just working together. You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do with your opportunities when you get the ball.”
Florida is ready to right the ship this week.And having an extra week to prepare 
helped, Jones said.
“Everybody’s minds kind of got scattered 
all over the place,” Jones said. “We had to pull 
back together mentally and on and off the field, 
we’ve gotten better as a team. I mean, it’s go-ing to be tough because people throw stuff at us that we don’t want to hear, but we’re going to pull together and get these Ws.”Welcome to the “Rocky Top” edi-

That’s right. The alligatorSports road

how it forced him to buy a bug bomb at 
Lowe’s and set it off inside his car. Re-ally, Zoop? What’s the worst that could have happened to you? Necrosis? That’s not too bad. It could’ve been Ebola.

� MIDDLE BLOCKERS 
HIGHLIGHT THE MATCH.
IAN COHEN
Alligator Writer @icohenb
Florida and LSU meet tonight in 
very different circumstances.
The No. 9 Gators (8-3, 2-0 South-
eastern Conference) are riding a 
three game winning streak, while 
the unranked Tigers (5-6, 0-2) are 
trying to halt a two-match skid.The former outscored their last 
three opponents 9-1. The latter are trying to climb out from an 8-5 dis-advantage.
Despite the differences between 
the two SEC foes, LSU boasts one similarity with UF that few other SEC teams can: a dominant middle 
blocker.
LSU’s star middle is 6-foot-1 
sophomore Briana Holman, the 
SEC’s leader in blocks (73) and sec-ond in points (219.5).Holman will go head-to-head 
against UF’s 6-foot-4 freshman Rhamat Alhassan, just as she did last year against Florida’s Chloe Mann, the NCAA’s all-time leader in hitting percentage.
In last year’s matchup between 
LSU and UF in Baton Rouge, La., 
Mann bested Holman by two kills 
with 14, but was out-blocked 6 to 2. Ultimately, Florida defeated LSU 3-1.
Coach Mary Wise is looking for-
ward to the matchup.
“(LSU) has one of the best mid-
dle’s in the country. She’s a dynam-ic hitter and blocker who’s just so 
fast off the floor and hits at angles,” 
she said. 
“Last year it was quite the ex-
perience to watch her and Chloe (Mann) against each other.
Despite LSU’s 0-2 SEC record 
and Florida’s 34-5 record against the Tigers all time under Wise, the coach expects a closely contested 
match.
“LSU is a team that … you 
can see every match their score 
is (close). They’ve won a whole bunch of them and have been right there in the others,” Wise said on Monday. “So what we hope to do is to be back here a week from today and say that we are a better Gator 
team than we were a week ago.”
Another matchup of importance 
will be between senior libero Holly 
Pole and LSU’s defensive special-ist Haley Smith. Smith is 6th in the SEC with 180 digs while Pole is 
12th with 137.
The senior libero’s main focus is 
getting better after each match, the 
same theme Wise has drilled into her players since before the season began.
“There’s nothing that’s really 
glaring that we need to work on, but it’s a lot of little things that 
we’re trying to get better at right 
now,” Pole said. “So a couple things with our defense, finding rhythm with our offense, always working on our serving, stuff like that.”
Florida is averaging 1.41 service 
aces per set, good for second in the SEC. LSU is close behind at No. 6 with 1.18 per set.

GRAHAM HALL
Alligator Writer @Graham311
Coach Paul Spangler knows 
the importance of seizing every 
opportunity to improve. 
He has emphasized capital-
izing on opportunities often 
to the women’s cross coun-
try team, and now they have changed the schedule in an at-tempt to progress by compet-ing against some of the elite teams in the country.
Instead of racing at the Walt 
Disney Invitational on Oct. 11, they’ll instead race Saturday in 
the Paul Short Run at Lehigh 
University in Bethlehem, Penn.
The race, a 6k for the wom-
en, will be run by more than 100 teams, including 55 Division I teams. Florida has a chance to compete against schools from across the country, including Alabama, Miami and South 
Carolina.
The race also gives the Gators 
a chance to compete against 
many schools in the northeast that it wouldn’t normally have a chance to race against.
“It’s a great meet,” Spangler 
said. “It’s going to be a great opportunity for the women to 
earn some at-large points to-
wards the National Champion-ships, and I know they’re really looking forward to the meet this weekend.”
While the entire roster is 
comprised of Gators craving the competition, maybe none are craving it more than red-
shirt junior Grace VanDeGrift. 
A Southeastern Conference All-Freshman Selection in 2011, VanDeGrift has been sidelined from the cross country team due to numerous injuries, in-cluding a meniscus tear, stress fractures in her leg and mul-tiple back injuries.
She began doubting if she 
would ever return to the sport 
she has devoted her entire life 
to.
“It’s discouraging,” VanDe-
Grift said. “It’s especially tough when you train to get back in shape, and you’re faced with another injury.
“It’s really mentally and 
emotionally straining, get-
ting hurt again when you feel 
like you’re so close to getting back.”
Despite the odds against 
her, VanDeGrift returned to the team this year and competed in the Mountain Dew Invitational on Sept. 20.
While most would have 
been happy to just be back, VanDeGrift had other plans in mind. She has to show she is better than anyone had seen.
She did just that in finishing 
the 5k in 17:51.11, the best time she had ever competitively run in that distance.
For someone like Spangler, 
who has seen her practice and battle back for years, the career-best finish was no surprise. 
“My hat goes off to her,” 
Spangler said. “A lot of athletes haven’t gone through what she’s gone through with inju-ries, and most probably would have given up the sport.
“Every year she’s fought 
back and every season she’s fought back, and to see her come out in her first cross coun-try race in 3 years, to run a life-time best, utmost respect for Grace and everything.”VanDeGrift still 
running despite 
numerous injuries
rest of us listened to the wise words 
of D.J. Durkin. Seriously? You’re so high and mighty now that you have 
a full-time job that you choose to 
skip out on Durkin. At least you’ll be at the game this weekend. Oh wait.
In fourth place with a 19-19 re-
cord is Morgan “Reptile House” Moriarty, who entertained listeners on the alligatorSports podcast about her vast knowledge of living, breath-ing alligators. You better watch out, 
Morgan. We’ve seen those gators eat 
bigger things than you.
Tied with Morgan with a .500 
record is Jordan “I like markers” 
McPherson, who’s highlight of the 
week was purchasing a four pack of dry-erase markers. Seriously Jor-dan? Are you that much of a worka-holic that buying markers for the 
office is the most exciting experience for you? Dude, it’s not that great, they weren’t even scented.
In sixth place and two games be-
low .500 Richard “good Samaritan” 
Johnson, who came to Czupryn’s rescue after receiving the follow-
ing text: “Can I ask a big favor from 
one of you guys. I’m stranded at the CVS on Archer and was wondering if I could get a ride to and from the 
Alligator?” Good for you, Richard. 
And how does he follow that up? By helping a random guy push his truck across Archer and 34th. Most of us probably would have left Zoop 
on the side of the road, but you did 
the right thing. 
Tied with Richard for sixth at 18-
20 is Thomas “Movin’ on up” Gold-
kamp, who finally moved out of 
dead-ass-last after being stuck there since this season’s Picks column be-gan. Maybe the New Orleans Saints should follow your path if they want 
to break out from the dweller of the NFC South. But then again, I guess there’s nothing wrong with being 
tied with the Bucs, right?
And in dead-ass-last with a piss-
poor record of 17-21 is Nick “Swipe Right, Ask Questions Later” de la 
Torre, who debated the pros of the 
dating app Tinder during media availability this week. Really, man? If you put as much time into your picks as you do to swiping away on 
your phone, you might actually be 
doing well. But I’m pretty sure your Tinder sightings will totally give you the bigger victory in the end.

Florida takes its show on the road 
tonight in a highly anticipated top-10 
matchup against Texas A&M, but if you believe the players, the only number they are concerned about is the ﬁ  nal score.
Fresh off a weekend sweep of confer-
ence foes Georgia and Missouri, South-eastern Conference offensive player of the week Savannah Jordan leads the No. 9 Gators (8-2, 3-0 SEC) into College Sta-tion, Texas, to take on the sixth-ranked Aggies (9-1-1, 3-0 SEC) at 8 p.m.
But Florida is not putting stock into 
what the voters think about either team.
“We don’t know anybody’s ranking, 
I don’t even know our ranking,” junior Christen Westphal said. “I think they’re kind of pointless, honestly.”
While those rankings will have little 
inﬂ  uence on tonight’s outcome, they do speak volumes about the quality season each team is having.
The Gators enter College Station on 
a four-game win streak, outscoring op-ponents 11-3 during that stretch. They’re undefeated in SEC play and haven’t lost a game in regulation since August 29.
But both of Florida’s losses this season 
came on the road, and Texas A&M boasts one of the toughest home-ﬁ  eld advantag-es in the country.
The Aggies are 7-0 at home this season, 
outscoring opponents 20-5 when playing at Ellis Field, the last time being a 3-0 vic-tory on September 18 against Tennessee.
Texas A&M is an offensive minded 
team that will look to attack early and of-ten. Florida coach Becky Burleigh knows that defending them will be a big chal-lenge.
“We respect their players,” she said. 
“They’re a lot like us. They’re a senior-laden group, they’re older, they’re expe-rienced, and I think that part of it is what makes them special.
“I think the biggest thing for us is pos-
session. When we keep the ball a lot, the other team doesn’t have it. Nothing can happen when they don’t have it.”
Westphal, who plays primarily as a 
defender, agreed with Burleigh.
“For our team, our offense is our de-
fense,” she said. “As long as we keep the ball and we play how we wanna play, we shouldn’t be pressured that bad.”
Playing a weekend on the road means 
the team has limited practice time during the week, and because of that, Burleigh said she does not worry about the oppo-nent. 
Instead, she has the players work on 
themselves, focusing on the details of their own games.
“It’s more about sort of reﬁ  ning some 
of the things that we do, and making sure that we focus on the details that we need to – to prevent them from scoring, and to create scoring opportunities for our-selves,” Burleigh said.16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2014
