Florida residents who want to vote in the 
Nov. 6 general election have until 5 p.m. to-
day to register.
Although most on-campus registration 
will be ﬁ  nished, voters can still drop off applications in person or mail them to the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections 
Ofﬁ  ce, 111 SE First Ave., as long as they are 
postmarked with today’s date, said county Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter.
U.S. citizens who are legal residents of 
Alachua County and at least 18 years old are 
eligible to register and vote, according to the 
county Supervisor of Elections website.
Students can download a voter registra-
tion form from the county Supervisor of 
Elections website, www.votealachua.com.
Jamie Lowstetter, a 20-year-old UF nutri-
tional sciences and biology junior, changed her registration from Leon County to Ala-chua County while campaigning for Student 
Government elections.
She said she was inspired to vote in Ala-
chua County by a commissioner who spoke at a Senate meeting. During the speech, she 
realized that local elections can affect UF.
“I’m not really in Tallahassee anymore,” 
she said, “so other than the national elec-
tions, it was much more pertinent that I ex-press my opinion and my voice where I con-
sider home now, which is Alachua County.”

Angelos Barmpoutis doesn’t want dis-
tance to keep students from sharing a class-
room.
That’s why the UF Digital Worlds Insti-
tute research and technology coordinator is 
developing the Virtual Distance Learning 
Classroom, a digital system that will allow 
students to congregate online in virtual re-
ality classrooms from the comfort of their 
couches.
Unveiled in November at SC11, a super-
computing conference in Seattle, the system creates 3-D avatars using the infrared depth sensor in Microsoft’s Kinect sensor.
“We call it computer vision,” Barmpou-
tis  said. “It’s a system of algorithms that sees you in a 3-D space.”
Barmpoutis likened the process to the 
ﬁ  ctitious body-scanning technology por-
trayed in the “Terminator” series. Current-
ly, the Virtual Distance Learning Classroom can measure a user’s body measurements 
in real-world units like inches and feet.
“It’s like putting eyes in a computer,” he 
said. “Back then it sounded like science ﬁ  c-
tion, but this is what the project does.”
Once scanned into the system, students UF class lets students connectJOANNA BERKOWITZ

When voting day came around for 
the Venezuelan elections, UF student 
Rafael Arroyo rode from Gainesville to 
New Orleans to cast his ballot.
Venezuelan citizens across Florida 
ﬂ  ocked to Louisiana to vote in the 
Sunday presidential elections. Citizens 
used to be able to vote in Miami, but 
that consulate ofﬁ  ce was closed ear-lier this year due to political disagree-ments.
“I voted because I want the best 
for my family and my country,” the 23-year-old economics senior said. “I will take any action that will beneﬁ  t them, whether it requires going all the 
way to China to vote.”
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 
was re-elected for a third six-year term 
after a close race against candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski.
Chavez won with 55.14 percent of 
the vote, according to Consejo Nacio-nal Electoral’s website, the national electoral council. Capriles came in sec-ond with 44.24 percent.
Arroyo said that he went all the 
way to New Orleans because he felt it was his civic responsibility to vote for Capriles and the change he promised.
“The current administration planted 
hatred among people 
with different ideolo-gies,” said Arroyo, president of the UF Venezuelan Student Association.  “Voting 
for the democratic 
option in the election represented a chance 
of reconciliation.”
Nicole d’Empaire, a 20-year-old UF 
microbiology junior and secretary of the Venezuelan Student Association, said she feels cheated by Chavez’s vic-tory.
“I haven’t stepped foot in Venezu-
ela since I left six years ago, and now the chances are even less,” she said.Venezuelan students       
disappointed with election“I’m not really in Tallahassee 
anymore, so other than the national

Piccadilly Cafeteria, 2620 NW 13th St., closed Sunday. The company filed for 
bankruptcy following an “aggressive legal maneuver” by the company’s lender.
◗ THE COMPANY FILED ON SEPT. 12.
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Contributing Writer
For Leighann Bellew, Piccadilly cafeteria on 
Northwest 13th Street was the go-to place for 
good chocolate cake.
But on Sunday , the 13th Street location closed 
its doors for good, leaving the 21-year-old UF the-
ater senior without her devil’s food cake.
The Baton Rouge-based restaurant chain filed 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Sept. 12 after an “ag-
gressive legal maneuver” by the company’s lend-er, Atalaya Capital Management, according to a press release.
Piccadilly, founded in 1944, has about 80 res-
taurants throughout the Southeast, the release stated.
“When it comes to our team members and guests, closing a Piccadilly restaurant is the last 
option that we want to consider,” said regional 
manager Frank Frantom in a statement. “How-ever, it is necessary to ensure a continuation of the Piccadilly brand.”
Frantom said the company will try to place 
employees from the 13th Street location at other Piccadilly restaurants.
Mark Rush, a UF economics professor, said 
Piccadilly is no exception to the tough restaurant 
economy.
“It’s always a hard time being in the restaurant 
business,” he said, “and it’s been harder in the last 
few years.”
From the time a student enters UF as a fresh-
man to the time of graduation, Rush said that res-taurant section of the phonebook will see signifi-cant change because “restaurants come and go.”
For Bellew, Piccadilly’s end is a sad one.
“It’s not like I went there all the time,” she 
said, “but it was a nice place to go.”Piccadilly closes 13th Street

Gainesville residents will raise 
awareness of bullying during the 
Unity Day Rally and March Against Bullying on Wednesday.
Marchers should gather at the 
northwest corner of Southwest 13th Street and West University Avenue at 4 p.m.
After the one-mile march east to 
the Bo Diddley Community Plaza, the rally will begin at 5:30 p.m.
The rally is sponsored by the lo-
cal River Phoenix Center for Peace-building in partnership with the national Parent Advocacy Coalition for Educational Rights.
“Bullying shapes young people so easily,” said Heart Phoenix, board president of River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding. “We hope to end 
bullying this year.”
The rally will 
feature several 
speakers such as 
Gainesville May-
or Craig Lowe, 
Gainesville Chief 
of Police Tony 
Jones and county school board members, as well 
as musical guest Dani Shay from the 
California anti-bullying campaign 
group Be More Heroic.
Phoenix hopes that about 150 
people will attend. The organization invited several schools in the county as well as other community organi-zations.
The organization offers media-
tion services, diversity training, an-
ger management courses and more, 
according to its website.
Gators for Alternative Dispute 
Resolution, a Levin College of Law organization that focuses on media-
tion, will co-sponsor the rally.
Marchers will wear orange shirts, 
which is the color for bully preven-
tion awareness.
October is National Bullying Pre-
vention Month.

nerstone to kids who feel disem-powered,” Phoenix said.Gainesville residents fight bullying

The Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention reached a 
tally Monday of more than 100 people infected with fungal meningitis, though Florida has 
remained relatively unaffected.
The disease, which has been 
linked to tainted steroids, has 
infected four Floridians and killed eight others across the country.
“You don’t want to get any 
infection in the skull,” said Wolfgang Streit, a UF neurosci-
ence professor. “It could lead 
to compression of vital centers in the brain that could cause a person to die.”
Methylprednisolone acetate, 
the type of steroid used in the infected samples, is used to treat back and neck pain.
The New England Com-
pounding Center, which made the steroids in question, recent-ly issued a voluntary recall of the drug.
Paul Myers, administrator 
of the Alachua County Health Department, said there have been no cases of the disease in Alachua County and said he isn’t aware of any tainted ste-roids in the county.
He said all the doctors who 
have used the steroid in the past few months have been told to get in contact with any pa-tients who were injected with 
the drug.
He said it’s important to 
make sure these types of drugs 
are created in a sterile environ-ment, especially because they’re injected into the spine.
“This is clearly a case of 
carelessness,” Streit said. “Somebody wasn’t washing their hands.”

Megaphone-amplified cheers reverberated 
against the brick walls near Turlington Plaza Mon-
day afternoon at an anti-war rally by the UF chapter 
of Students for a Democratic Society.
The event marked the 11th anniversary of the 
U.S. invasion into Afghanistan, said 20-year-old 
history junior Skye Schmelzer. As one of the event’s 
lead organizers, Schmelzer rallied with other stu-
dent members of the organization to remove U.S. troops from Afghanistan and prevent other U.S. im-perialism in Syria.
“The U.S. has been in the Middle East for too 
long,” Schmelzer said.She said she believes that countries in the Middle 
East have the right to self-determination, and the 
U.S. should not interfere.
Chrisley Carpio, another lead organizer, reiterat-
ed the national demand for self-determination. The 
20-year-old history junior also emphasized the need 
to end drone strikes. Carpio said drone attacks are 
responsible for many deaths in the Middle East.
“People view what goes on in the Middle East as 
an isolated pattern,” she said.
At the end of the rally, students proudly raised 
their anti-war signs and shouted.
“I know my voice matters,” Schmelzer said.”The 
voice of the people matter, and we can make any-thing happen.”Students protest Afghanistan war
About 50 to 100 participants can interact at the same time 
will be able to join other avatars in 
an online classroom, which could 
look like anything from a tradi-
tional learning space to a life-size 
model of a Grecian theater. Dis-
tance units are the same in the vir -
tual classroom and the real world, so taking a step forward on camera translates to a step of the same size online. Avatars can also interact 
with virtual objects.
Barmpoutis said the Virtual 
Distance Learning Classroom had 
some physical barriers, such as network connections, with large 
classroom sizes. Currently, the 
system can stream about 50 to 100 
participants interacting at once.
But just because a student might not be 
shown during the entire class 
doesn’t mean 
they can’t inter -
mittently partici-
pate, Barmpoutis 
said.
“You can 
have thousands of students watch-
ing the instructor but not partici-pating,” he said. In this scenario, a student would appear upon rais-
ing his or her hand.
For Michelle Roca, a 19-year-
old sophomore accounting major, 
waiting to be seen wouldn’t be a problem. She said the virtual class -
room would be more efficient than the current format of online video 
lectures.
“There would be more student-teacher interaction,” she said. “I know a lot of people don’t want to 
go to office hours.”
Barmpoutis said the Virtual 
Distance Learning Classroom is still in its development stage, but 
he hopes to release a functional 
prototype for some classrooms by 
the end of Spring semester.

This year, the Asian Ameri-
can Student Union’s month-
long heritage celebration will 
brighten the lives of the un-
derprivileged.
The organization kicked off 
its 19th annual Asian Kaleido-
scope Month celebrations Oct. 
2. 
The celebrations, which 
will center around the theme of “Illuminate,” will include 
community service opportu-
nities, entertainers, fashion shows, lectures, panels and workshops.
The monthlong celebra-
tion, which will end Nov. 2, 
aims to raise $2,000 for A Liter of Light, a project that brings portable lighting to low-in-come homes across the globe.
“We are dedicated to shed-
ding light on various Asian 
and Asian-American issues, 
and their project is dedicated to bringing light into the lives of millions,” said Michael Satyapor, an economics se-nior and assistant director for Asian Kaleidoscope Month.
“All of the events show 
the different sides of Asian-
Americans,” said Sabrina Chan-Pong, a 21-year-old UF marketing senior and co-programming director for the 
event series, “so people that 
come out can see that we’re more than just the stereo-types.”
The month is set up with 
five main events — an open-ing ceremony, a scholarship pageant, a fashion show, a tal-ent show, an Asian food festi-
val and a closing ceremony. 
The opening ceremony had 
about 300 attendees, Chan-
Pong said.
There are nine smaller 
events throughout the month, including a day of community service with Habitat for Hu-manity and an LGBTQ panel.
For the kickoff, the Asian 
American Student Union brought several well-known Asian-American entertain-ers to UF, including Ryan 
Takemiya, founder of a Pan-
Asian arts-and-entertainment organization called RAMA, Seattle-based band New 
Heights and Kelly Tsai, an 
Asian-American spoken-word artist from Brooklyn.
“This is an amazing oppor -
tunity for everyone at UF to 
meet these people, hear their 
stories and hear how diverse our community is,” she said.TUESDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Zipcar and the Ford Motor Co. 
has awarded the UF American 
Marketing Association $5,500 in Zipcar credits as part of the Zipcar Students with Drive program.
Each month, from Septem-
ber to April, Zipcar gives away $5,500 in credits to university or -
ganizations that win the contest. Each runner-up organization will receive $1,000 in Zipcar credits. For the month of September, the Students with Drive program had 10 runners-up in addition to five winners.
Zipcar representative Bill Con-
nolly said the Zipcar credits can 
be used for group memberships 
to join Zipcar or pay for driving hours in a Zipcar.
UF AMA president and ad-
vertising senior Jennifer Cephus said the application process con-sisted of liking the Zipcar page on Facebook, filling out information 
about AMA, uploading an AMA 
promotional video and receiving the most Facebook votes for the contest.
University organizations can 
apply within seven categories: academics, arts, athletics, com-munity service and student life. 
UF AMA applied through the 
academic category.
“Zipcar is a huge deal for us,” 
said Cephus, 21. “Now we can get out there and do anything and everything we set out to do.”
Cephus said with the $5,500 
credits, AMA members plan to use Zipcars to travel to the AMA 
2013 International Collegiate 
Conference in New Orleans.
The Students with Drive pro-
gram was first started in October 2011. Connolly said in the last year, Zipcar received about 300 applicants from nearly 140 col-leges and universities.
Connolly said Zipcar is on 
more than 250 campuses nation-wide. 
UF has 13 Zipcars on five cam-
pus locations.
Along with winning the 
$5,500, AMA will be entered to win a grand prize in April. The grand prize includes an addition-al $5,000 Zipcar credits, $10,000 
for the student organization and 
$10,000 for the winning univer -
sity.
“Finalists will discover with 
(the) addition of Zipcar to their organization, they can broaden scope of what they do as an orga-nization,” Connolly said.UF American Marketing

An exhibit featuring photo-
graphs taken of America and 
Europe between the world wars opens at the Samuel P . Harn Mu-seum of Art today.
The Modern Impulse covers 
the years between 1918 and 1945 and emphasizes more than 40 art-ists who captured the age by using technology, according to the Harn’s website.
“I think this is an opportunity to 
look at our own time through the lens of the past,” curator of con-
temporary art Kerry Oliver-Smith 
said.
Oliver-Smith, who has worked 
at the museum for 21 years, spent more than a year putting together this exhibit from the Harn’s ar -
chives as a way to connect students 
and the community to history.
“This was when the camera was 
such a new innovation, it’s almost 
what the Internet is to us now,” she said.
About 135 photographs, books, 
illustrated magazines and films will be on display , according to the website.
Tami Wroath, director of mar -
keting and public relations, said she hopes faculty members bring their students.
“The museum’s goal is to share 
what we have in our collection and to let people know that art is for everyone,” Wroath said. “We have over 8,300 works of art, and many 
of the pictures from this exhibit are 
coming from our collection.”
The Modern Impulse will run 
until Jan. 6. Admission is free.Harn exhibit captures

Isn’t that how an opinion works?
You think about a speciﬁ  c topic and make a val-
ue judgment based on certain arbitrary criteria.
For example: My favorite football team is the Oakland 
Raiders. This is because my ﬁ  rst-grade teacher hated the Oakland Raiders, and I like to be a contrarian. 
Actually, before that time, I loved the Denver Broncos (if 
you’re not up on your NFL rivalries, Denver-Oakland is one of the more inexplicably violent ones).
I even had a Denver Broncos sweatshirt (with the old 
logo, the one where the horse is reared up like in Gericault’s “The Charging Chasseur” and shooting a laser beam out of its mouth) that I used to wear around.
But just because of one little, tiny reason, my whole opin-
ion did a 360-and-a-half.
So, I guess what I’m trying to say is that opinions are very 
personal.
In many ways opinions are the most personal thing we 
have: They’re deeply inﬂ  uenced by our upbringings, our en-vironments and the people we associate with.
That’s probably why so many people defend their opin-
ions even when they’re about ridiculous things (the episode 
in “Gulliver’s Travels” about the war that started over which 
side to break an egg on or whatever comes to mind).
Opinions are our strongest ties to the things we care about 
the most.
Every time you tell someone that your favorite movie is 
“Aladdin,” you’re subconsciously remembering all the awe-some times you’ve had watching “Aladdin,” quoting “Alad-din,” mocking the terribly bad “Aladdin 2” (the search for more money), talking about “Aladdin” to your family and 
friends, etc.
(What I’m trying to say is “Aladdin” is the best movie 
ever, and if anyone has a DVD copy I can borrow, I would 
love it because my VHS copy wore out a long time ago, and I don’t have any money.)
My opinion of “Aladdin” is derived from all of my inter-
actions with the idea of “Aladdin” throughout my life. My prolonged exposure to it has strengthened the mental con-nection between “Aladdin” and dopamine receptors or whatever it is in my brain that releases really good feelings whenever I think about “Aladdin.”
You may be thinking, “God, will 
this guy ever stop talking about ‘Aladdin’ and get to his point?” 
This is where that happens.Because my point is that, in my 
opinion, almost everything is a matter of opinion. Obviously there are a few laws of physics we can’t really just disbelieve away. But one of my favorites to argue about is grammar.
My old roommate and I used to argue for hours on end 
about whether misusing grammar is bad and wrong, or just a necessary and accounted-for by-product of the way actual language works. At least, I think that’s what it was about. We talked about a lot of different stuff, but it was under the um-brella of this one weirdly theoretical linguistic discussion.
My wildly unpopular opinion is that the purpose of lan-
guage is not to be correct, it is to be understood. Therefore, as long as your communicative act results in comprehension, it is successful, and you don’t need someone making a tran-
scendental judgment about it based on some absurdly com-
plicated and illogical system made up by a bunch of stupid British guys a long time ago.
This is almost deﬁ  nitely derived from the fact that the 
only class I failed in high school was freshman English, and I failed it because I bombed a grammar test. Personally, I think that the only good that comes out of a strict system of grammatical rules is the ability to create an aesthetic effect by subverting it. 
But that’s just my opinion!The great thing about opinions is that no matter what 
mine is, or yours is, or Obama’s is or some guy on the Inter-net’s is, no one gets hurt by them (directly)! 
Opinions are like blood cells: Everybody’s got a bunch of 
them, and they’re all awesome!

We ﬁ  nally forgave 
Tebow for leaving us
Do you remember Tim Tebow?
Of course you do.If you don’t, let us put it to you another way: If the 
football program was like drama club, Tebow was the guy who was always cast in the lead role. Only he actually deserved it, un-
like all those other jerks in your high school theater programs.
When Tebow graduated, he accidentally left a dearth of 
football-related talent in our program. We didn’t think we could 
ever be happy again. It was as if he broke up with us.
Relationships end all the time. It just takes people different 
amounts of time to get over them and move on.
For UF football, it took us about four years.There’s a strange feeling coming back to our campus. Can 
you feel it?
Without getting cocky , there’s a feeling of hope mixed with 
surprise.
Still, the campus has been healing itself for a while now, and 
we appear to be ﬁ  nally out of our breakup funk.
Here are seven tips for getting over a relationship. Let’s list 
them and see if they apply to the Gators.
1. Make plans. It certainly seems like our football players do 
things other than focus on the past; at least they do things other than hang out at local bars like Ryan Lochte. He doesn’t even 
go here.
2. Be aware of the rebound. Not only did they have to deal 
with losing Tebow, the Gators football team had to then get over 
the loss of Urban Meyer. It was so bad, even Hoodie Allen men-tioned it in his “freestyle” rap about UF.
3. Participate in hobbies. Does going to class count? May-
be they can do those ﬂ  ashmob-esque group dances like other schools’ marching bands or prisoners in other countries do. “Gangnam Style” is practically already “Gator Style.”
4. Keep up daily self-care routines. We could probably all 
learn from these guys. They must be pretty regimented with their workout schedules. So, like, kudos to you, gentlemen.
5. Don’t overwork. This is key to relationship recovery, but 
remember that idle hands are the Devil’s plaything. Don’t over-work, but don’t underwork either. More cynical football fans might say that the Gators barely worked at all over the past few years, but we digress.
6. Set a daily time limit for grieving. This step is probably dif-
ﬁ  cult, considering Tebow’s name is mentioned pretty often; he’s still so relevant to the Gainesville area somehow, plus the media loves to follow his post-college career. There’s basically no es-cape. But it’s also been four years since he left UF, so it seems like the time for grieving is over.
7. Seek professional help. Here’s where Coach Muschamp 
enters the picture. He can be moody at times, yell at his players or at the referees, but he’s the expert opinion that we turn to in times of trouble. And it’s starting to pay off.
Now, the shift in attitudes could affect the football quality or 
vice versa.
But really , all it did was take some time. Time heals all 
wounds.

Sunday night marked the hotly contested presidential 
elections for Venezuela, a country that has been un-der the rule of Hugo Chavez since 1999.
Critics thought the election was pointless, fraudulent 
and controlled by the current government. Some voters 
were skeptical about the validity of their votes and if the 
election would be legitimate.
Those who support the opposition and planned to 
vote for Henrique Capriles Radonski wondered whether Chavez could be taken down democratically.
Despite these sentiments, millions of people headed to 
the polls to have their voices heard.
They didn’t let the incredulity of others stop them from 
practicing their civic duty — even if this meant having to 
drive for 18 hours, which is exactly what some people 
did.  
In January, Chavez shut down the Venezuelan consul-
ate in Miami, which is home to the largest concentration of expatriates in the U.S. Critics saw this as an attempt to keep nearly 20,000 registered voters from casting their votes.
Officials said they would have to vote in New Orleans, 
the next closest diplomatic outpost, more than 800 miles 
away.
Organizers of AeroV otar, a 
nonprofit initiative to counter -
act the voting blockade, raised 
enough money to rent six planes for the election. More than 1,200 Miami V enezuelans flew to the country’s consulate in New Or -
leans.
Those who didn’t make the project’s waiting list were 
directed to V otoDondeSea, a similar project busing people to the polls.
People went above and beyond to cast their votes in 
a questionable election where some speculated foreign votes aren’t even tallied.
Those who distrust the election’s acknowledgment of 
expatriate votes went as far as flying back to the country for the weekend. The sacrificing of time, money and con-venience seemed a small price to pay for a monumental vote.
Their determination inspires but also infuriates me 
because it increases my annoyance toward peers who are skipping out on our own presidential election.
How, pray you, are we the more developed country 
when educated people are too lazy to vote? When stu-dents prefer staying in and watching “Here Comes Hon-ey Boo Boo” to practicing a legal right?
We should take notes from the Venezuelan constitu-
ents who didn’t take their rights for granted. We should look up to those who voted in the South American elec-tion and follow suit.
I wish my uninterested friends realized how accessible 
voting is for them. I wish they realized not everyone could 
vote. (I’ll be taking my U.S. citizenship exam Thursday af-
ternoon, so I won’t make the voter registration deadline.)
Most of all, I wish they realized “I’m not informed 
enough” is not an excuse. Every time I hear that phrase, I feel like punching a wall.
“Get informed!” I scream inside my head. “Don’t 
waste your right.”
I understand the influx of electoral information getting 
spewed at us is intense, and the media make it hard to differentiate between fact and fiction. But that’s why it’s important to research each candidate, watch the debates and get a feel for the presidential options.
With 63 voting stations in Alachua County and early 
voting possibilities, Gainesville peeps should have no vot-ing limitations.
If eligible U.S. voters give half the effort V enezuelan 
expatriates gave Sunday , then Nov . 6 might be just as monumental. Regardless of the outcome, the V enezuelan constituents knew they gave it a shot.
Come on, Gator Nation. Let’s give it a shot, too.Valeria Delgado is a journalism senior at UF . Contact her

Speaking OutSince the advent of second-wave feminism in the 
1960s, the mainstream feminist movement has suf-fered a disquieting decline in popularity. 
According to a 2009 poll conducted by CBS News, only 
24 percent of American women identify themselves as 
feminists.
Among men, numbers are even more disheartening: 
Only 14 percent of the American male population identi-
fies as feminist, while 24 percent of American men regard 
the term as an insult.
It is difficult to see what could be so off-putting about a 
movement whose primary aims are so innocuous.
I doubt that feminism’s detractors would oppose the 
elimination of institutionalized gender inequalities or en-dorse the objectifying practices that underlie a culture of 
rampant sexual assault. It is equally unlikely that these self-proclaimed antifeminists would champion the glass ceiling, defend employment discrimination or speak out 
on behalf of domestic abuse.
What, then, could possibly account for the recent wave 
of hostility toward the feminist position — a position 
whose goals are so uncontroversial by most modern stan-dards?
“People see feminism as a knocking down of men rath-
er than a convergence of the two genders,” one ’13 male, who asked to remain anonymous, said. Furthermore, J.P . Harrington ’14 explained that he is not a feminist because 
he perceives the movement as having “largely strayed 
from self-determination and independence to arguing for special benefits.”
These anecdotal reports lend credence to what I have 
long suspected — that most opposition to feminism de-
rives from a complete misunderstanding of what the 
movement actually entails. Backlash against the feminist position is not a response to the arguments and ideas pre-sented in feminist literature or women’s and gender stud-
ies classrooms, but rather, a response to the caricatures of 
feminism that riddle popular culture.
According to common logic, the feminist is an unshav-
en, combative creature intent on the utter destruction of the male sex. She is willfully ignorant of the difficulties 
that males face in our society, and she is self-righteously 
indignant at every opportunity.
Although she is quick to blame individual men for the 
long history of chauvinism plaguing the Western world, 
she remains incredibly resistant to engaging in even a cur -
sory examination of her own role in the process of female 
marginalization.Even the most favorable popu-
lar portrayals of feminists still tend to represent them as aggressive, 
abrasive and unappealingly sanc-
timonious.
Such a characterization could not be more misleading. 
Although the term “feminism” refers to a diverse array 
of stances and intellectual advocacies, there is widespread 
consensus among feminists that the goal of the movement is to promote critical dialogue and self-reflection. Femi-nism is not so much a commitment to a certain set of beliefs as it is a commitment to general inquiry and dialectic.
Prominent feminist theorists like Luce Irigaray and Ju-
dith Butler are less wedded to any particular account of the world than they are to presenting challenges to un-questioned cultural conventions.
Much of the criticism levied against feminism relies on 
the unfounded assumption that feminists ignore men’s is-sues or hope to fight misogynistic hierarchies by revers-ing them. In point of fact, most contemporary feminists are quite sympathetic to the male plight. From a feminist 
perspective, female oppression and male oppression arise 
from the same central source: the series of social expecta-tions that conspire to create gender roles. The chauvinism responsible for the suppression of women is bound up 
with the very same cultural structures that demand cer -
tain behaviors from men.
The notion that women should be demure, sentimental 
and delicate is closely related to the corresponding notion 
that men should be strong, stalwart and reserved.
Consequently, any discussion of gender norms that 
fails to address men’s issues is miserably incomplete.
Feminism is nothing if not cautious when it comes to 
assigning responsibility and blame — indeed, many tomes 
have been dedicated to an examination of women’s hand 
in their own subjugation, a consequence of the internaliza-tion of sexist ideologies.
The position is not antimen — it is merely anti-patriar -
chy and reasonably so.
The myth of the dogmatic, hysterical feminist is one 
more attempt to silence the feminine voice and discredit the female point of view.
The assumption implicit in such accounts is that wom-
en could only oppose their own oppression by assuming an unreasonable posture, an assumption that smacks of familiar stereotypes and prejudices.

Donnie Young starts his morn-
ings watching deer from his front-
porch rocking chair.
The 38-year-old former All-SEC 
offensive guard sits as the sun rises and listens to the rustling of deer. He waits and worries.
Nowadays, between fretting 
about tangled pigtails and preschool classes, Young’s biggest fear is a small fly carrying a deadly disease.
The noseeum, named for being 
so small that you can’t “see ‘um,” is Young’s 3-millimeter menace.
The fly carries epizootic hemor -
rhagic disease, or EHD, which is 
fatal to the white-tailed deer that 
roam his ranch, DY Trophy Ranch. Aside from his wife and children, he said his life revolves around deer, 
and EHD is an epidemic that threat-
ens that life.
“When it occurs, it’s devastating 
to the white-tailed deer population,” Phillip Kaufman, a UF associate professor of veterinary entomology, 
said. “This year in Florida, we’re 
having a bigger outbreak.”
Young, president of the Florida 
Deer Association, said EHD has af-fected herds of white-tailed deer 
for “eons,” but the Florida Fish and 
Wildlife Conservation Commission released a notice in September ask-ing hunters to report incidences of 
the disease.
“It looks like the flu,” Young said. 
“Their chance of survival is 50-50 at 
best, but it’s really about 70-30.”
Another problem is that when the 
meat starts to decompose, the virus dies. All evidence is gone within 24 hours.
It’s tough to find deer that quick-
ly.
Young patrols his ranch every 
day to check on the hundreds of deer that roam the property.
His daughter Kaley, 6, and her 
5-year-old sister, Kinsey, ride with their dad to his ranch when the weather is cool.
Sometimes he lets Kaley take 
the wheel of the Polaris Ranger off-
roader. Standing up at the wheel, 
she nearly disappears behind her daddy’s trunk-sized legs, but her pink, kid’s size 11 Fatbaby Cowgirl boots still stand out.
When they come across a deer 
that looks sick, he mixes a medi-
cine cocktail and loads it into his air 
gun.
Young said it’s tough to tell the 
difference between an unhealthy deer and one with EHD. Their show through their skin from malnourish-ment, their heads droop and saliva drips from their mouths.
He shoots the sick deer with the 
antibiotic dart and waits a few days. When they have EHD, they rarely get better.
“Instead of a dart, you’d almost 
rather give them a bullet,” he said. “It’s better than having them suf-fer.”
One of the biggest problems 
about monitoring the disease is the 
deer can die within hours of being infected. Sometimes death can take 
weeks, but it’s usually within a cou-ple of days.
“We’re looking for help to keep 
monitoring this,” Kevin Baxter, the spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said.
When a deer gets the disease, areas 
in its neck and head swell, and it will seek a quiet place to be alone. In the thicket of oaks, pines and palms, there are plenty of places to hide, even from 
an experienced hunter like Young.
Sometimes it’s easy to find deer 
that have been affected. They’ll try 
to cool themselves off. He’ll find them floating in one of the lime-green 
lakes. 
He said losing deer to disease 
isn’t just sad — it’s costly. Some of 
the deer used for breeding can fetch 
up to $500,000. 
He said the disease is brought up 
frequently at the Florida Deer Asso-
ciation’s meetings, where they dis-cuss things like the cost of feed and 
herd health. 
“When EHD hits, it’s often seen 
where deer populations are high,” 
Kaufman said. “An individual farm-
er may lose large numbers of their 
deer.” 
“We lose millions of dollars of 
captive herd animals, and in the wild, there’s no telling,” Young 
said.
Kaufman said the noseeums 
can’t reproduce in moving water. 
But when heavy rains come in the 
summer, they create large puddles, 
perfect for breeding.
“We see it go away when we get 
to freezing temperatures,” Young said.
To fight the disease, Young and 
Dwight Knight, the former president of the Florida Deer Association, de-veloped a vaccine by using organs 
of dead animals to isolate the virus.
“It’s probably one of the worst 
diseases affecting herds,” he said. 
“Hopefully we’ll have a good win-ter. We’re going to need it.”

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender characters 
are on TV screens this season more than ever, and it’s 
causing mixed reactions in Gainesville.
About 4 percent of actors on prime-time network 
series portray LGBT characters this season, according to the “Where We Are on TV” study that was released Friday by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defama-
tion.
The 4.4 percent of LGBT TV character exposure is 
the highest level GLAAD has ever seen, said Matt Kane, 
associate director of entertainment media for GLAAD. That number shows a 1.5 percent increase from the 2.9 
percent represented in 2011.
“This increase shows that the LGBT community is 
finding greater acceptance on television and with the 
audiences,” Kane said.
GLAAD studied 97 shows on the five broadcast 
networks and graphed out regular characters with an LGBT affiliation. About 700 characters on TV were found to portray the affiliation in some aspect, with all orientations and character statuses confirmed by the 
networks, he said.
Although LGBT characters are becoming more pop-
ular, what’s shown on TV isn’t always like reality, said 
Matthew Wintle, sponsorship director of UF’s Pride 
Student Union.
“People take shows like ‘The New Normal’ and base 
their perspectives off that,” Wintle said. “That show has 
a lot of stereotypes, and a wide range of the gay and transgendered community don’t fit those stereotypes.”
Chris Boyett, an 18-year-old English freshman, said 
he felt similarly.
“The increase of gay characters on television is im-
portant, but the characterization in these shows is re-
ally forced,” Boyett said. “A lot of the producers and di-
rectors in Hollywood are part of the LGBT community, so they need to work on creating more well-rounded characters that represent themselves better.”
Shows like Glee don’t show the LGBT community 
in a good light, he said. The show emphasizes on the flamboyancy, which isn’t accurate to what the commu-nity is really like.
“We see shows like ‘Modern Family’ and ‘Will & 
Grace,’ and a lot of those are just two white gay men,” UF LGBT affairs director Lauren Hannahs said. “We still don’t have a lot of variety in terms of getting trans-gendered and bisexuals noticed.”
Even though Americans are becoming increasingly 
accepting of the LGBT community, media outlets and networks often take more conservative approaches, she said.
“It’s hard to pinpoint a perfect example because the 
LGBT community is so diverse,” Wintle said. “Callie and Arizona from ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ are probably the best representation I can see on TV because it gets to the heart that we’re all just people.”
But the increase in character development shows 
that audiences resonate with these characters, Kane said.
“With Unique’s storyline on ‘Glee’ still to come and 
Chaz Bono on ‘Dancing with the Stars,’ we’ll get to see 
the different personalities within the community,” he 
said.
Wintle said he believes the representation will get 
better over time.
“As time progresses, the statistic is going to increase,” 
Wintle said. “We’re making progress, but there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done.”Study finds more

 Florida is in uncharted ter-
ritory. 
After UF’s worst two-year 
stretch since 1988-1989, the 
Gators have enjoyed a streak of success the likes of which most current players haven’t experi-
enced in their college careers.
  After scoring 14 unan-
swered points to defeat then-
No. 4 LSU on Saturday and snap the Tigers’ 18-game regu-
lar-season winning streak, UF 
leapfrogged six spots to No. 4 in the newest AP poll. 
  Whether the Gators can 
handle the national spotlight remains to be seen. 
Florida, winners of ﬁ  ve 
straight, travels to Nashville, Tenn., to take on Vanderbilt 
on Saturday in Vanderbilt Sta-
dium.
  “We’ll see Saturday night,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “To this point, (we’ve done) very well as far as understand-
ing and approaching each 
game the same. We’re not go-ing to put in any more hours as coaches this week than we did 
a week ago. We’re not going to 
put any less, either. We’ll pre-pare very similar to what we’ve done this far in the season.”
  Although his exuberant 
after-game antics in the lock-
er room may suggest other-
wise, Muschamp made sure to point out that Florida’s victory against LSU counted  for only 
one. 
  While UF’s ﬁ  rst win against 
a top-ﬁ  ve opponent in Mus-
champ’s tenure created an un-usual buzz, Florida has started 
preparations for win No. 6.
  In 105 years of playing foot-
ball, UF has reached 6-0 just 
seven times.
  For the third time this sea-
son, Florida is facing a South-eastern Conference foe on the road.
  The Commodores aren’t the 
same team that has dropped the last 21 meetings against the Gators and has been outscored 199-74 in their last ﬁ  ve match-
ups.
  Vanderbilt, led by second-
year coach James Franklin and redshirt senior  quarterback 
Jordan Rodgers, couldn’t re-cover an onside kick down ﬁ  ve points with less than two min-utes to go in the fourth quarter 
against Florida last season.
  The Commodores out-scored the Gators 21-9 in the second half but couldn’t erase 
a 17-point halftime deﬁ  cit, ulti-mately losing 26-21.
  Last season’s ﬁ  ve-point 
deﬁ  cit was the closest game 
between the two teams since a 
21-17 UF win in 2002.
  “We have our work cut 
out for us at 6 o’clock there in 
Nashville,” Muschamp said. 
“Look forward to another op-portunity to go out there and get better.”
  Florida’s defense believes 
it isn’t the same football team that lost six of its last nine to close out 2011.
  UF showed against LSU on 
Saturday that it could contend with the physical heavyweights 
of the SEC who dominated the 
Gators last season.
  Fullback Hunter Joyer said 
people still doubted Florida 
before its victory against LSU. 
He treated the matchup as a statement game.
  Message received, but the 
Gators have turned their sights 
to a bigger prize than just beat-
ing the Tigers in the season’s ﬁ  fth game.
  “Like we’ve been saying all 
along, we have a more mature team this year,” quarterback 
Jeff Driskel said. 
“We’re not going to be Florida looking to avoid letdown

 Mike Gillislee was named South-
eastern Conference Offensive Player of 
the Week on Monday for his efforts in 
Saturday’s win against LSU, but both 
he and coach Will Muschamp gave credit to the blockers.
  “Being patient as a running back 
(is important),” Gillislee said on Satur-day. “That’s all being a running back is (about) — being patient and having faith in your offensive line. Knowing that the holes will be there sooner or 
later.”
  The holes opened up in the second 
half, as Gillislee averaged just 2.8 yards 
per carry in the ﬁ  rst half and 5.1 yards 
per carry in the second.  His longest runs of the day were two 
12-yard touchdowns, the ﬁ  rst of which 
came when left guard James Wilson and left tackle Xavier Nixon pulled to the right and opened up a gaping hole 
that Gillislee ran through untouched.
  Muschamp said he was impressed 
with the offensive line’s ability to han-
dle the Tigers’ defensive front.
  “You’ve got to ﬁ  nish blocks,” Mus-
champ said. “Because most of the teams we’re going to play from here 
on out, they don’t stay blocked long. Line credited for run success FIRE JOE MORGAN
  Florida’s 14-6 upset victory against LSU 
on Saturday was a microcosm of UF’s season.
  The Gators held tough defensively while 
the offense turned the ball over twice and re-
corded just 47 yards on 32 plays during the 
ﬁ  rst half.
  Then, a slew of halftime adjustments helped 
Florida dominate.
  “It’s not like we’re waiting [for] the second 
half to turn it on,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said on Saturday . “We’re trying to make plays in the ﬁ  rst half.”
  The Gators are a second-half team, and 
that’s one hell of a trait. Florida has rallied back from halftime deﬁ  cits against Texas A&M, Tennessee and LSU.
  UF has scored 57 percent of its points in the 
second half and has outscored its opponents 41-0 in the fourth quarter. No other team in col-lege football has shut out all of its opponents in the ﬁ  nal quarter in 2012.
  The Gators have averaged 221.6 yards of to-
tal offense after halftime this season. If Florida duplicated its second-half offensive output during the ﬁ  rst half, it would jump from 10th in the Southeast-
ern Conference in to-
tal offense to fourth.
  Meanwhile, UF 
has left something to 
be desired before halftime. Florida has been outgained in all ﬁ  ve ﬁ  rst quarters this season by an average of 36.2 yards.
  UF scored 24 points in the ﬁ  rst half against 
Kentucky on Sept. 22, but has averaged just 8.5 
points before halftime in its other four games.
  Despite their ﬁ  rst-half struggles, the Gators 
are the No. 4 team in the country and are ﬁ  rmly 
in control of their destiny in both the SEC and national championship races. 
  If folks think Florida is scary now, imagine 
what this team could do if it actually played a complete game. If the Gators want to keep Strong UF team one step away

Florida got away with a sluggish first 
half against then-No. 4 LSU, but that will 
not work three more times against No. 3 South Carolina, No. 14 Georgia and No. 12 
Florida State.
Nobody is that lucky . 
Bad starts have nearly proven costly on 
numerous occasions this season.Had Bowling Green kicker Stephen 
Stein not missed field-goal tries of 31 and 29 yards, Florida would have entered the fourth quarter of its season opener trailing 20-17. 
Against Texas A&M, coach Kevin 
Sumlin’s attempt to “ice” Caleb Sturgis on a 51-yard field goal late in the first half backfired. Sturgis’ first kick ricocheted off 
the right upright, but his second try was 
true, pulling the Gators within one touch-down.
Let’s say Sumlin holds his tongue and 
Sturgis misses the kick. Considering Flor -
ida had yet to stop Texas A&M’s offense, dual-threat quarterback Johnny Manziel may have turned good field position into another score. 
On Saturday against LSU, Tigers line-
backer Kevin Minter knocked the ball from 
the hands of wideout Frankie Hammond 
Jr. midway through the second quarter. LSU’s Kwon Alexander scooped up the ball and appeared to have only daylight in front of him, but luckily for UF, Hunter Joyer was there to make a touchdown-saving tackle. 
Later in the quarter, Driskel fumbled 
to set the Tigers up at the Gators’ 7-yard 
line. If not for one of the gutsiest defensive 
stands in college football this season, LSU heads into the halftime with momentum and a 10-point lead.
Granted, there was a lot of “iffing” and 
“butting” there, but eventually, the pen-dulum is going to swing the other way.
If the breaks stop going in Florida’s 
favor, what happens next? A team with a 
run-first mentality and a first-year starter 
at quarterback could struggle to erase deficits.
Driskel is a talented guy , but if the 
Gators are in dire straights with the clock ticking down, they would much rather have the ball in Mike Gillislee’s hands.
Gilly can’t run out of bounds to stop 
the clock after every play.
UF needs to start games better offen-
sively. Expecting Driskel to be Tim Tebow against the Gamecocks and the Bulldogs is a bad strategy.
Simply put, Gillislee and the Gators’ 
offensive line need to impose their will on opponents quicker and earlier.
Florida is one of the best teams in col-
lege football. Earning some championship 
hardware in 2012 is a real possibility.
It would be a shame if the Gators were 
on the outside looking in come champion-
ship season just because they have some trouble getting things going on Satur -
days.

The tables have turned in Gainesville. 
Gone is the frustration of two sub-par 
seasons. 
Now the Gators deal with the optimism 
and confidence that comes with being a top-five team.
Florida’s first test as a member of the na-
tion’s elite comes from a familiar opponent — one the Gators aren’t taking for granted.  
Driskel isn’t treating this week differently than any other.
“Every SEC game is big,” Driskel said. 
“You can’t take anybody lightly because anybody can beat you. This league is full of players and full of athletes.  [Vanderbilt is] 
going to be well-coached, and they’re going 
to be ready to go. We can’t take this week off or take it lightly. We’re going to prepare like we have been the whole year, and we’ll be ready to go come Saturday.”

org.UF looking for answer at punt returner
So you’ve got to finish people, and that’s something that jumped out at me on the tape.”
Punt Returns: One of the few units Muschamp was 
not pleased with following Saturday’s win was the punt return team. Andre Debose and De’Ante Saun-ders did not return any of Tigers punter Brad Wing‘s 
seven punts.
Wing booted a 57-yard punt from the LSU 14 on 
the Tigers’ second possession of the second quarter. 
Saunders called a fair catch at the Florida 29-yard line, although no LSU player was within 10 yards of him.
“We have not done a good job,” Muschamp said. 
“We’ll find somebody different and figure out what we can do there.”
Muschamp said Florida’s punt returners must do 
a better job of deciding whether or not the ball is re-turnable.
“He’s got to make a judgment as he sees the flight 
of the ball and then see where the coverage (is),” Mus-champ said.
Omarius Hines: While Gillislee carried the ball a ca-
reer-high 34 times on Saturday, Omarius Hines only touched the ball twice. But he made the most of his 
chances.
On Florida’s first touchdown drive, Hines gained 
14 yards on a carry around the left side of the line be-
fore picking up another 14 yards on a screen pass. Muschamp said simply having Hines on the field 
forces the opposing defense to be ready for a number of possibilities.
 “I’ve always said it’s difficult to count him from a 
defensive perspective,” Muschamp said. “What is he? Is he a running back? Is he a slot receiver? We’ve used him in tight-end situations. We’ve used him as a full-back. So, week to week, we change out.”
Hines has averaged 10.5 yards per touch this sea-
son on just seven catches and six rushes. Quarterback Jeff Driskel said he’d like to find more ways to get Hines involved in the offense.
“We try to get him touches during the game,” 
Driskel said, “but there are some games you’re going to have to give the ball to Gillislee 35 times or how-ever many times he got the ball. [Hines] is definitely a mismatch problem, and we got to get him some 
touches.”
Injuries: Starting weakside linebacker Jelani Jenkins 
is probable for Saturday’s game at Vanderbilt after leaving Florida’s win against LSU in the second quar -
ter due to a left hamstring injury, Muschamp said. Jenkins wore a cast in his return to action on Saturday after missing the previous two games with a broken right thumb.
Muschamp added that tackle Matt Patchan is still 
out with a pectoral strain, while defensive back Cody Riggs remains sidelined by a broken right foot he suf-fered in the SEC opener at Texas A&M.

Taylor Brauneis doesn’t mind dishing 
away the ball or the spotlight.
Instead, she prefers it, coach Mary Wise 
said.
The junior setter’s performance last 
weekend was key to the No. 11 Gators re-
maining undefeated in the Southeastern Conference. While Ziva Recek racked up 
her second conference award and her first 
SEC Offensive Player of the Week honor, Brauneis will continue to feed her team-mates attention, as long as the wins keep 
coming.
“She’s not the high flashy setter,” Wise 
said. “She’s very much the steady, hard-
working player that has no problem stay-ing under the radar. She would be just 
fine out of the spotlight. Let it go to Chloe 
(Mann) or to Tangerine (Wiggs).”
In Sunday’s match against Kentucky, 
Florida fell two sets behind because of 
poor passing, Wise said. But she added 
that Brauneis was persistent in getting clean looks to Recek, Wiggs and Mann de-
spite the “ugly volleyball” the other Gators 
were playing.
“Even when we weren’t passing well, 
Taylor Brauneis had a very, very good 
match,” Wise said. “She did an excellent 
job bettering the ball. When it wasn’t a 
three-option pass, she was still able to de-liver a quality set.”
Coming into last weekend’s homestand 
against Arkansas and Kentucky, the trans-
fer from Louisville led the SEC and ranked 
20th nationally with 11.62 assists per set. She has led the team in assists every time she has taken the court for Florida.
Even after her near double-double on 
Sunday (47 assists and nine digs) helped propel Florida to its 10th straight win, Brauneis immediately passed the credit to her teammates and even the fans.
“We come in here and we’re smiling 
because the fans were in it and we were 
in it,” she said on Sunday. “It was a total 
team effort, and it just feels amazing.”
Wise said Brauneis helps her team with 
her knowledge of the sport — a major rea-son why she was named the squad’s floor captain. The floor captain communicates in-game strategies and acts as the go-be-tween for players and officials.
“We did that because one, she is the one 
player who is on the court the whole time 
and two, because of her high IQ,” Wise 
said. “Look at the numbers. The hitting efficiency numbers have a lot to do with 
those hitters, but also a lot to do with Tay-
lor Brauneis.”Even as the conference’s top setter and 
the team leader on the court, Wise said Brauneis slips back into her quiet role off 
the court. 
She prefers to let her play do the talk-
ing, leaving the other chatter to her louder 
teammates. 
“She’s OK with taking a backseat to the 
more vocal, outgoing players in this pro-gram,” Wise said.

 �TRAVIS’ DEFENSE KEYED 
UPSET VICTORY ON SUNDAY.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Writer
 
Taylor Travis and Shea Groom 
were almost teammates. 
Coach Becky Burleigh recruit-
ed Groom heavily in high school, 
but the now-sophomore turned 
down a chance to play forward 
alongside Travis in Gainesville and instead went to College Sta-
tion, Texas.
On Sunday, Groom and Tra-
vis squared off against each other when No. 18 Florida (10-3-1, 7-1 
Southeastern Conference) visited No. 5 Texas A&M (12-2-1, 6-1-1 
SEC). 
Travis, who moved from for -
ward to outside back before the season, had the tough task of 
defending Groom. One of Tex-as A&M’s most potent threats, 
Groom scored six goals in 10 
matches in 2011 before suffering a season-ending ligament tear in 
her foot.
Groom scored the Aggies’ lone 
goal, but it was Travis and the Gators who prevailed, defeating 
Texas A&M 2-1. 
“I thought Taylor was really 
up for that game, and did a really good job of shutting her down, which is not easy to do,” Burleigh said.
From the beginning of the 
game, Travis made it known that Groom would not have an easy 
time getting through Florida’s 
backline.
Five minutes into the first half, 
Groom received a pass from for -
ward Annie Kunz and dribbled into the box. Travis sprinted from 
behind Groom, slid and knocked the ball away. The tackle sent 
Groom to the ground. 
Groom got up smiling after 
Travis’ aggressive slide tackle, but Travis would frustrate her 
enough to remove the smile from 
her face.
“[Travis] had a lot of blocked 
shots and just denied [Groom] her 1 v. 1 specialty,” Burleigh said.
Travis made another defensive 
stand in the 22nd minute. Goal-keeper Taylor Burke was pres-sured by two Aggies forwards 
and sent an errant pass to the feet 
of Texas A&M midfielder Beth West. West fed Kunz directly in 
front of the net, and she dribbled 
forward. 
Travis darted in and knocked 
the ball away from Kunz and out of bounds, breaking up what would have likely been the first 
goal of the game.
“I was very impressed with 
[Travis] today,” senior Jo Dragotta said after the game. “She showed 
what she can do.”
However, the corner that re-
sulted from Travis pushing the ball out of bounds led to the only time Travis could not stop 
Groom.
On the resulting corner kick, 
Groom got in front of Travis near the far post and was able to head 
the ball in to give the Aggies a 1-0 lead.
Travis would not let it happen 
again.
In the final minutes of the 
game, Texas A&M pressured the 
Florida defense in a last-ditch ef-
fort to send the game to overtime. Travis broke up two passes inside 
of the penalty box, preventing the 
Aggies from getting a chance to equalize.
In the final seconds, Travis 
battled with Groom two more times. With about 25 seconds left, she fought Groom for possession 
off of a header, ultimately pop-
ping the ball up in the air to junior Adriana Leon.
Groom stole the ball from Leon 
and dribbled towards the edge of the box, but Travis again got 
in her way. Groom tried to break 
away and dribbled towards the goal line, but Travis used her foot to knock the ball out with only 10 
seconds remaining.
“[Getting the ball out] was the 
only thing I think, not only on my mind, but on everyone else’s 
mind,” Travis said. “We were try-ing to keep our composure, and at 
times we did very well, but then 
the last minute or two … you just need to get the ball out.”
Burleigh said she thought 
Travis did a great job of shut-ting Groom down throughout the game, despite Groom’s goal.
“Taylor gets really motivated 
when she plays against somebody who is just as fast as she is,” Bur -
leigh said. “That doesn’t happen too often.”
