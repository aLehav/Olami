Shiloh took a sniff: He knew ﬁ  rst.
The police dog alerted ofﬁ  cers to the 
smell in the car during a trafﬁ  c stop, and they found about 90 pounds of marijuana.
Gainesville Police arrested a Fort Lau-
derdale man Tuesday night after a high-way trafﬁ  c stop revealed he had an esti-mated $356,000 worth of marijuana in his car.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 51-year-old Michael 
John Cefola on charges of marijuana traf-ﬁ  cking, according to an arrest report.
At about 7:45 p.m., an ofﬁ  cer working 
with the Gainesville-Alachua County Drug Task Force was patrolling Interstate 75 and noticed a car driven by Cefola weaving in trafﬁ  c.
After pulling the car 
over, the ofﬁ  cer asked Cefola if he could search his vehicle, but Cefola didn’t consent, according to the report.
Shiloh, a Labrador retriever certiﬁ  ed to 
detect drug smells, alerted the ofﬁ  cer to the odor. 
Citing probable cause, the ofﬁ  cer 
searched the vehicle and found a bag with 89.5 pounds of high-grade marijuana, ac-cording to the report
During questioning, Cefola said he was 
driving the weed from California to South Florida for $15,000.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Cefola into the Ala-
chua County Jail at about 10 p.m. He was released at noon Wednesday after meeting a $40,000 bond.

Bo Diddley Community Plaza could receive a makeover 
as soon as this fall, and renovations to the East University 
Avenue side of the plaza could bring more performers and programs.
The estimated $1.4 million project would include stor-
age rooms, restrooms and dressing rooms for performers. 
In the past, performers had access to only an 8-by-8 foot 
storage room and a public restroom facility before going on stage. 
The renovations would also feature a restaurant similar 
to the Lunchbox Café.  
Sarah Vidal-Finn, manager of the Gainesville Com-
munity Redevelopment Agency, said the plaza isn’t used much during the day.
“The biggest hope for the project is to really increase 
better utilization of the plaza during all times of the day,” she said.
With construction potentially beginning in late fall, Vid-
al-Finn said the renovations will cause as little disruption as possible, especially for the plaza’s homeless population. A homeless resource center set to open May 1 could allevi-ate some construction concerns.
Russell Etling, interim manager of cultural affairs for 
the City of Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Af-fairs department, said the improvements will bring more visitors to the plaza.
“We are thrilled that it will get a face-lift and hopefully 
become even more popular,” he said.  Bo Diddley Plaza 
could get $1.4 million makeover

UF Hillel and Gator Dining Servic-
es are working together to make sure 
Jewish students don’t go without ko-sher food options this Passover.
During the eight-day celebration, 
observers are prohibited from eating food that rises. For the ﬁ  rst time, ko-sher-for-Passover food will be avail-able on UF’s campus at Gator Corner Dining Center and the Fresh Food Company. 
The food will be available through-
out the holiday, which takes place from Monday to April 22.
Rabbi Gail Swedroe, the assistant 
director of Hillel who is serving her second year as campus rabbi, said as far as she knows, this is the ﬁ  rst time UF has offered kosher options speciﬁ  -cally during Passover.
“Last year, I found out like a month 
before the holiday that there wasn’t any kosher-for-Passover food in the dining halls, which totally surprised Hillel, Gator Dining team up for Passover

Siblings share a lot of 
things: parents, a home, ge-
netics and sometimes even a school.
Today is National Siblings 
Day — a day to honor siblings and their never-ending rela-tionships. Brothers and sis-ters everywhere will blow up social media with the hashtag #nationalsiblingsday.
Twins Erin and Dennis 
Boyle, both 20, said they enjoy having family at UF.
Dennis, a ﬁ  nance sopho-
more, jokingly admitted to lik-ing the fact he can keep an eye on Erin, a nursing sophomore.
“He’s protective some-
times, so that’s really annoy-ing,” Erin said.
Both remember the day 
they received their acceptance letters to UF, but for a brief moment that day, it seemed as though Erin would be the only Gator.
Dennis said it got a little 
chaotic in the time between his sister’s acceptance and his. When he ﬁ  nally saw his congratulations message, he said he “immediately just Tebowed.” Erin said her family wasn’t 
sure her brother would get ac-cepted.
“I was almost considering 
going to FSU if he was gon-na go there,” she said, “even though I really wanted to go to UF, but he’s kind of important in my life.”
Another set of siblings, 
Morgan and Jordan Billinger, share the campus as well. Both feel like they have a piece of home here, but Morgan, a 19-year-old UF speech therapy sophomore, feels there is also a bit of competition between them.
“We are both in the college 
of Public Health and Health Professions, so we’re compet-ing but it’s more like a brother-ly-sisterly rivalry versus some-thing more serious,” Morgan wrote in an interview. 
Jordan, a 21-year-old UF 
public health junior, said he prefers to have family here, especially when he was an un-derclassman.
“Sometimes school can get 
really stressful, and you may even get homesick,” Jordan said. “If your sibling goes here with you, there is always someone in your corner pro-viding a support system.”In all kinds of 
weather, UF siblings stick together
� IT’S A REQUIREMENT FOR 
UF ARMY ROTC STUDENTS.
EMILY JULSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
At 5:30 a.m. when most stu-
dents were in bed, some ROTC 
Gators were taking a plunge. 
The UF Army ROTC program 
conducted its annual Combat Wa-ter Survival Training on Wednes-day morning at the Florida Pool, where cadets tested their survival skills in the water with full equip-ment in tow.Capt. Nathalie Conley, an 
assistant professor of military science in the UF Army ROTC department, said the test is a com-missioning requirement for all UF Army ROTC students.
It requires students to complete 
a 10-minute diagnostic swim, ﬁ  ve minutes of treading water and a 15-meter swim.
It also includes a blindfolded 
3-meter drop in the water with their equipment and a drop in the deep end of the pool where they have to take off all the gear with-out surfacing, Conley said.
“This training is generally not harder than other programs, ex-cept for those who don’t know how to swim,” she said. One cadet had to be rescued by the lifeguard during the exercise.
“Lately, there has been a 
turn in the Army where people aren’t up to stuff on their swim-ming skills or their aquatic abili-ties,” said cadet Tyler Schaper, a 22-year-old UF geography senior. “This training just gets them used to swimming and dealing with water problems.”
Conley said ROTC provides 
free lessons to students who are struggling with swimming.

CAR LIKE HIS SISTER DID.

Two siblings will soon share 
more than an alma mater: They’ll 
share a 27-foot-long hotdog car experience.
Silvana Smud, a UF alumna 
who graduated as a telecommu-nication major in 1999, got the job of driving the Oscar Mayer Wie-nermobile across the country for a full year after graduation.
The job is difﬁ  cult to get: Only 
12 drivers are chosen out of more than 2,000 applicants every year, she said.
The genes must run in the 
family, because Smud’s younger brother, Spencer Smud, also got the job.
“I had such an amazing expe-
rience with this job and I always wanted Spencer to have the same experience,” Silvana said.
Spencer, a 23-year-old UF rec-
reation, parks and tourism se-nior, will graduate in May and start driving the Wienermobile in June.
The job is a one-year contract 
that involves driving across the country and hitting three cities a week for speciﬁ  c events, Silvana said. Drivers are known as Hot-doggers.
When she had the job, a then 
7-year-old Spencer would come out to the events and help his sis-ter. It was a part of his childhood.
“Next thing I know, I’m ﬁ  nd-
ing out I’m going to have one of the best jobs that a college gradu-ate could ever have,” Spencer said. “People saw me literally do my happy dance.”
Spencer will ﬂ  y to Wisconsin 
on June 1 and go through a two-week training known as “Hotdog High.” He will graduate as part of Hotdogger Class 27. His sister was in Class 12.
Silvana said their family is also 
ecstatic about their shared Hot-dogger status.
“Just the fact of having two 
Hotdoggers come out of Brandon, Florida,” she said. “They are just thrilled.”
The Smud siblings said the 
shared experience is extremely rare and hope that it will bring them closer.
“USA Today quoted that statis-
tically, it’s easier to become presi-dent of the United States than to be chosen as an Oscar Mayer Hot-dogger,” she said.
me, given the large number 
of Jewish students here,” she said.
Last June, Swedroe started 
coordinating with Gator Din-ing to get kosher options in UF’s dining halls this year to better meet the needs of the student population.
“A lot of people keep ko-
sher for Passover even if they don’t keep kosher for the rest of the year,” she said. 
Jaron Mandel, a 21-year-old 
UF accounting senior, said he thinks the option is going to work well for a lot of students.  
“I’m happy that they’re do-
ing it,” he said. “I’m sure it will be the start of something really nice.”
Jonathan Josephf, a 19-year-
old UF biology sophomore, said he struggled to ﬁ  nd ko-sher options on campus last year with his meal plan.
“I’d have to buy matzo at 
Publix and just make make matzo and cream cheese sandwiches and PB&Js on my own,” he said.
Josephf, who still has a meal 
plan, said he thinks the part-nership with Hillel is “very progressive,” and he plans to take advantage of it.
Kosher offerings include 
hard-boiled eggs, tuna salad, fruit and salad. Gator Dining is also exploring the option of serving kosher yogurt and sau-sage, Swedroe said.
Passover-friendly options 
will be marked with kosher symbols, she said.
The food will be prepared 
in disposable pans and served on disposable plates so it doesn’t touch anything that has prepared or served bread products.
In addition to the strictly 
kosher foods served, kosher-style options containing no-bread products such as salmon prepared with no breadcrumbs will also be available.
“It’s hard if you’re living 
on campus,” Swedroe said. “I want to make it easier.”Kosher dining hall 
food will be prepared, served separately  4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2014

Drinks are coming.
2nd Street Speakeasy, located 
at 21 SW Second St., unveiled a “Game of Thrones”-themed menu Friday before the start of season four.
General manager T.J. Talmieri 
said the bar staff has been planning this menu theme for five months.
“We’re all big fans of the show 
and kind of nerdy,” he said.
Talmieri said it’s obvious how 
some of the names relate to the show, such as “The Red Wedding,” which is inspired by a massacre in season three and contains bourbon, hibiscus tea and averna.
Kelly Micheau, a bartender at 
the speakeasy, said she and Talm-ieri tried to think of ways to repre-sent the characters through drinks. 
“It wasn’t like we made a Cos-
mo and named it after Khaleesi,” she said, referring to a main charac-ter in the show.
Micheau said their themed 
menu has drawn positive reactions because of the show’s popularity.
“It’s awesome we have the cre-ative ability to do that,” she said.
In the past, the bar has fea-
tured other themed menus based on hit shows like “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad.” Talmieri said it is open to the idea of another one in the future.
“It’s not planned out yet, but 
these things tend to go pretty well,” Talmieri said.
Afagh Zadeh, a 21-year-old UF 
architecture senior, said she is a frequent customer at the bar and thinks a themed menu like this adds hype to a night out.
“I feel like a town like Gainesville, 
which is based on cheap drinks for students, could use a little excite-ment with the drinks,” she said. Game of Thrones drinks debut locally

The Staff, the all-male a cappella group at 
UF, is beginning to raise funds for its first al-
bum.
The group is having a free show Saturday at 
3 p.m. in the Reitz Union Auditorium, where the boys will announce a Kickstarter campaign to fund their album, Bradley Arnold, a member of The Staff, wrote in an email.
“As we mature and grow as a group, we 
feel the album will help us to be recognized to a greater extent by those in the a cappella com-munity and beyond,” said Arnold, a 19-year-old UF biochemistry freshman.
Jaewon Jang, a 19-year-old UF finance soph-omore and business manager of The Staff, said he wants to increase awareness for the a cap-pella industry.
“We want to be part of the general mission 
of having a cappella being better known and also our group being better known,” he said.
The Staff is hoping to produce its first full-
length project with Swamp Records, the new student-run record label at UF, Jang said.
Alyssa Adams, an 18-year-old UF athletic 
training freshman, said she loves to see The Staff perform around campus. She said the group is well on its way to being popular among all mu-sic listeners, and the Kickstarter campaign will help boost support for them.
“If they can make the album, I would be re-
ally excited to hear it,” she said. “They are one of the most talented a cappella groups I have heard, and I know their album would be a suc-cess.”A cappella group The Staff

 National Alcohol 
Screening Day
Today is National Alcohol Screening Day, and more than 
600 colleges in the U.S. will be holding free alcohol screen-ings on their campuses to help students identify any prob-
lems they may have with alcohol abuse. It’s a fantastic idea; af-ter all, nearly 2,000 Americans ages 18 to 24 die each year from alcohol-related injuries. The annual screenings are hosted by a nonproﬁ  t called Screening for Mental Health, which advocates mental-health and substance-abuse resources to be made read-ily available to those who need it. 
UF, however, is not participating, which is pretty surprising. GatorWell Health Promotion Services offers great resources 
for students struggling with alcohol problems and students who know people struggling with alcohol. The school’s medi-cal amnesty policy protects students from disciplinary action if they suspect a friend has alcohol poisoning or has overdosed on drugs and call 911. Counseling is available at no charge to stu-dents in the UF Counseling & Wellness Center, and GatorWell has educational information on its website about alcohol abuse. 
However, we like the idea of the PR initiative that a National 
Alcohol Screening Day event would provide. Rather than push-ing a single anti-alcohol-abuse idea, the anonymous screenings would be a way for mental-health providers to connect with stu-dents who may be at risk. 
In fact, a screening day (or multiple screening days) may be 
the missing link in alcoholism prevention that UF needs. Gator-Well offers proactive resources for stopping underage drinking and alcohol abuse, and the CWC offers solutions for people who’ve realized they have a problem. But how can the univer-sity help students identify the fact that they may have an un-healthy relationship with alcohol?
Because we’re immersed in a culture that normalizes extreme 
alcohol consumption, many of us have no way of knowing if our alcohol habits are unhealthy. Young people who are just becoming exposed to practically limitless amounts of alcohol need ways to determine whether or not they’re truly drinking responsibly and if habitual alcohol abuse is a symptom of a deeper problem. 
That’s why anonymous screenings work. According to the 
National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, screenings have become a “mainstay of today’s preventive health care.” 
“Screening is not the same as diagnostic testing, which es-
tablishes a deﬁ  nite diagnosis of a disorder. Instead, screening is used to identify people who are likely to have a disorder, as determined by their responses to certain key questions,” the NIAAA websites states. “People with positive screening results may be advised to undergo more detailed diagnostic testing to deﬁ  nitively conﬁ  rm or rule out the disorder.”
Anonymous screenings, then, offer a nonthreatening way 
for students to become more aware of their relationships with drinking. 
We hope GatorWell will consider participating in future col-
lege National Alcohol Screening Days to raise awareness about alcohol-related mental health issues and direct at-risk students to the right resources to prevent further problems.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgWednesday’s question: Have you tried 
e-cigarettes?Today’s question: Do you watch Game of Thrones?Criminal justice system favors the rich
There are two criminal justice systems in the U.S.: 
one for the rich, one for the poor.
You don’t have to look far to ﬁ  nd both of 
them. Two stories set the Internet on ﬁ  re recently, both regarding child abuse. 
Sanesha Taylor is a black, homeless mother of two 
whose mugshot went viral, complete with tears running like rivers off her cheeks. She was arrested for leaving her two children, aged 6 months and 2 years, while she was in a job interview. Her children were taken away, and she’s facing trial for a felony. The only way she’s been able to pay legal fees so far is through online do-nations. 
“She was upset. This is a sad situation all around. 
She said she was homeless. She needed the job. Obvi-ously, not getting the job. So it’s just a sad situation,” said Scottsdale Police Sgt. Mark Clark, according to Connecticut TV station WFSB.  
It goes without saying — it’s not a good idea to leave 
your kids locked in a hot car. But are those conditions much different than the ones they’d face on the streets? This woman was homeless, trying to make a better life for her kids and herself by getting a job. It’s not as if she had money for a babysitter. 
Robert H. Richards IV is a white, afﬂ  uent father and 
heir to DuPont, the ubiquitous chemical company. He also confessed to raping his 3-year-old daughter in 2009. The case recently went viral after it became public when his ex-wife ﬁ  led another suit against Richards seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the sexual abuse. Richards received a probation sentence for rape instead of jail time because the judge felt he would “not fare well” in prison. 
Of course, it’s unclear who exactly does fare well in 
prison, though looking at this dichotomy does make one thing certain: The two-tiered criminal justice system is alive and kicking. On one hand, you have a woman get-ting charged with a felony for going to a job interview to make a better life for herself. On the other, you have a rapist getting a slap on the wrist for molesting his own 3-year-old daughter. 
Of course, the worry for Rich-
ards stems from the stereotype that people who raped children 
are treated worse than other inmates in prison. 
I’m not sure if this is true, having never been in pris-
on myself, but there are options other than letting him off with probation. 
An inmate can be placed in protective care alone if 
his or her safety is threatened. The idea that he wouldn’t fare well is no excuse for his sentence. 
The juxtaposition of these cases is a clear-cut remind-
er of the dual criminal justice systems in the U.S.  In fact, people of color make up more than 60 percent of the prison population, according to the Sentencing Project, an advocacy group for prison reform. 
One in every three black men will likely go to prison 
in his lifetime, compared to one in 17 white men. Not to mention that the U.S. has the largest prison population in the world. 
As soon as racism enters the discussion, too many 
retreat. We live in a post-racial society, they say. We elected a black president, after all. But racism is bigger than individuals or prejudice. Racism is systemic, and it has infected every institution from our systems of edu-cation to incarceration.  This single story of disparity ﬁ  ts into a larger narrative of racism that our country must address. 
Skin color and ﬁ  nancial status shouldn’t be the de-
ciding factors in whether someone is a prisoner.

Tampa will soon be home to a new music 
festival that could rival events like Bonnaroo 
and Lollapalooza. 
The Big Guava Festival is scheduled to 
take place from May 2 to 4 at the Florida State Fairgrounds. It will include carnival rides, food trucks and craft beer gardens, along with a fantastic lineup.
The festival boasts a wide range of talent, 
including the recently reunited band Out-kast (in its only Florida performance), indie darlings Vampire Weekend and Foster the People and up-and-coming hip-hop artists Chance The Rapper and Earl Sweatshirt.
Neil Jacobsen, president of Live Nation 
Florida, said the festival was able to as-semble such a high-profile lineup for its first year because of its history with the artists.
“We are the largest promoter in Florida, 
and our company has a great track record,” Jacobsen said.
The festival’s four stages will spread 
across the fairgrounds, with one stage set to be at the Midflorida Credit Union Amphi-theatre.
There are plans to make Big Guava a 
staple of the Tampa Bay area, and Jacobsen said Live Nation wants Big Guava to be suc-cessful and grow.
“We want everybody to have a great 
time, enjoy the music, rides and food in a safe, fan-friendly environment,” he said.
The festival’s ticket includes complete 
access to the four stages and carnival rides. The Midflorida Credit Union Amphitheatre will be completely open, but pit access and seats will be available on a first-come, first-served basis.
Although the price of the event’s single-
day tickets was slated to go up in early April, festival organizers pushed back the price in-crease to expand their audience.
Live Nation Florida wanted to be con-
sumer friendly and continue to build inter-est in the festival, Jacobsen said.People across Florida and the U.S. are ex-
pected to flock to Tampa for the festival. 
Melissa Daum, a 20-year-old UF finance 
junior, said she’s excited to catch the head-liners and all of the up-and-comers.
 “I’m excited for Big Guava because 
there’s no better experience than a music festival with your friends,” she said. Daum said she’s most excited to see Fos-
ter the People.
 “‘Torches’ is one of my favorite debut al-
bums ever,” she said.
According to a news release, tickets are 
still available at livenation.com, but will in-crease in price Tuesday. Single-day tickets are currently $65 and will increase to $75. Single day VIP tickets are $175 and will re-main the same price. A three-day general admission pass costs $165 and the three-day Super Guava Pass costs $499 and includes reserved seating and access to the Super Guava Lounges.
Set times and the site map will be re-
vealed soon at bigguavafest.com.

Smiley faces, top hats and, yes, even that 
creepy, winking cat emoji are new ways to 
search through Yelp’s application for local business and restaurant recommendations.
Yelp was invented in 2004 to help people 
find local recommendations through email. Since then, Yelp has expanded to include so-cial networking features, discounts and mo-bile applications, according to the company’s website.
Ashley Vonada, a UF theater freshman, said she thinks although the new application feature is a good idea, the emojis won’t be spe-cific enough.
“If you use a smiley face, for example, it’ll 
just give you a bunch of good places to eat,” Vonada said. “You don’t know people’s own personal preferences with food online. It’s just some stranger’s opinion.”
The application would be more helpful in 
a place that you don’t know very well because most of the time people get restaurant recom-mendations from their friends, Vonada said.
But although this application is designed to 
make life easier, Vonada said she thinks that at the same time it’s making people lazier.
“One emoji won’t say as 
much as words will,” Vona-da said.
You’ll be sure to get 
what you want if you type in a query versus using an 
emoji, Vonada said.
But businesses like Designer Greens have a 
different view of the new emoji edition to the Yelp application.
Emily McGuigan, an employee at Designer 
Greens, said the new application emoji feature might not change business at Designer Greens that much because the business has always been successful.
“The owner has two of these restaurants 
— one in Orlando and one in Gainesville,” McGuigan said.
The restaurants have been open for seven 
and five years, respectively, and both do great business, she said.
But McGuigan said she thinks that if the 
emoji feature lets more people know about Designer Greens, then it is a good thing.
“We’re the only salad place in town,” 
McGuigan said.

The Gainesville Fashion Week 
team hosted its annual night of run-
way fashion on Saturday, debuting collections from ﬁ  ve local designers to an audience of about 500 people. From swimwear to menswear, the show displayed a wide range of styles and talent.
The ﬁ  rst collection to head down 
the runway was South Florida-based ZannieKini, a line of barely-there swimwear for young women. The playful bikinis ranged from solid, bright colors to tie-dye patterns with interesting straps as well as mix-and- match tops and bottoms highlighting the collection. THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2014  ALLIGATOR, 9 8, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2014
Second was YAYA, a collection 
from GFW’s director-at-large Ching-
Ya Ni, a 23-year-old UF political sci-ence and East Asian languages and literature senior with a focus in Chi-nese. The collection, a collaboration between Ni and designer David Ton-nelier, featured womenswear and menswear in an assortment of colors and textures, and intricate cutout details were a staple throughout the collection. With strong 90s themes, holographic details and mesh fabrics highlighting the pieces, YAYA was on trend, while still remaining fresh and unique.
Ni said she was inspired by the 
idea of repurposing clothing.
“To be able to repurpose a piece 
of clothing that makes it unique and one of a kind has always been an in-spiration in and of itself,” Ni said.YAYA was followed by a col-
lection from Francine Elizabeth, 
who was showing her designs for the fourth time at GFW. Described as having a sleek, aesthetic appeal to women in their early 20s, Fran-cine Elizabeth’s designs were clas-sic silhouettes with visual interest added by different fabrics and textures. A standout piece was a sleeveless peplum top with velvet paneling.
The fourth collection 
featured was The 1oz Proj-ect and Mikho, a menswear line. The designers described the collection as “a labor of love” and noted “the animal within you” as inspiration. The animal theme was ap-parent throughout the collec-tion, with giraffe and python among some of the prints. The models were acces-sorized with body paint and fur, emphasizing the animal-istic, wild theme.The ﬁ  nal collection of the 
night came from Julia Chew and her Xiaolin line. The col-lection of feminine dresses managed to remain both rel-evant and entirely unique with its combination of inter-esting, structured silhouettes and highly saturated fabrics and textures. 
Many gowns featured 
feathers, and the standout piece of Xiaolin — and per-haps of the night — was a ﬂ  oor-length gown covered in feathers. The gown also fea-tured a high, Victorian-style collar. The craftsmanship of the gown was impeccable, and the dark feathers ﬂ  ecked with jewel tones made the gown look sleek and ﬂ  uid.
From feathers to bikinis, 
this year’s GFW was able to debut local, relevant collec-tions that appealed to a va-riety of tastes and styles. As a whole, the range of local talent featured was both im-pressive and inspiring.

When picking your perfect frames, 
you want to make sure they ﬁ  t properly 
and reﬂ  ect your personal style. Ray-Ban has made your ideal shades just a click away with its new program Ray-Ban Remix. 
The program was initially launched 
last April, but only to certain countries like Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom. It wasn’t available to the U.S. and the rest of the world un-til this year.
Ray-Ban Remix is a customization 
program that allows you to design your own pair online. The process starts 
with choosing from nine models, chang-ing the frame and lens color and lastly, engraving something witty or personal that 
will make them unique. Easy on the swear words, though — they will be censored.
It also allows you to engrave the case 
that comes with the glasses.
The price for these custom frames 
starts at $130 — it costs to be cool. Thankfully, shipping is free.
There’s no more toying between two 
pairs of glasses in line at the mall. No more checking yourself out in the tiny mirror hoping no one’s watching. 
This customization program will 
surely cut the time looking for designer frames in half. It takes only ﬁ  ve minutes to click your perfect sunglasses into ex-istence — not counting the time spent with buyer’s remorse.
“I think it’s cool and all, but it 
would be better if the proceeds went to a cause,” said Gorana Gonzalez, a 21-year-old UF psychology senior. “It would make more people actually want to make custom sunglasses.”
Betsy Jean-Baptiste, a 19-year-old 
UF health science sophomore, said she doesn’t own a pair of Ray-Bans.
“But this new program deﬁ  nitely 
makes me want to look it up,” she said.

Since its debut in 2009, Best Coast has 
been the soundtrack of our breakups, 
beach-road-trip drives and hazy summer nights. If Taylor Swift is the pop queen of heartbreak and love lost, Bethany Cosentino is her cooler home-from-UC-Berkeley-for-the-summer older sister who always brings joints to the party. Florida fans of Best Coast can see Cosen-tino & Co. on Friday as part of Reitz Union Board Entertainment’s inaugural Big Orange Festival at 7 p.m. in the Reitz Union. 
As the lyrics of “Goodbye” suggest, 
Cosentino’s “highs are high” and her “lows are low”: Some of her best tracks celebrate the chill Cali-fornia lifestyle, while others describe break-ups so brutal that nothing is comforting — not even TV or a bunch of weed.
From the crunchy 
garage-band guitar ensembles on “Crazy For You” to the sleeker pop-rock sounds of “The Only Place” to the dreamy chill-wave tracks on “Fade Away,” here it is: Your ultimate getting-ready-for-the-show Best of Best Coast playlist. Bonus: a lo-ﬁ   Beach Boys cover that’ll leave you jonesing for an entire Best Coast Beach Boys tribute.

Chris Walker attempts a layup during Florida’s 72-49 win against Mis-souri on March 14 in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer@LandonWatnick
Minutes after Florida’s Elite Eight victory over 
Dayton on March 29, Chris Walker heard Gators 
fans chant “One more year! One more year!” as he climbed the ladder to cut down the nets. 
They got their wish Wednesday.Walker announced via his Twitter account (@
cwalkertime23) that he will return to UF for his sophomore season, opting not to test the NBA Draft waters. The freshman forward was projected as a late first-round pick in June’s draft. 
“This year has been a great one, and I’m happy 
to say I will be joining the gatornation again for one more year!” Walker posted at 4:30 p.m. Wednes-day.
With Walker back, Florida now has 12 of its 13 
scholarships committed for 2014-15. 
A highly touted prospect coming out of high 
school, Walker could not enroll at UF until after the fall semester ended on Dec. 14 because of academic ineligibility concerns. Following a 12-game suspen-sion handed down by the NCAA for receiving im-permissible benefits from agents, Walker made his debut with the team on Feb. 4. 
In 87 minutes on the court in 18 games for Flori-
da this season, the 6-foot-10 forward averaged only 1.9 points on 59.3 percent shooting and 1.3 rebounds per game but showcased his athleticism and shot-blocking in spurts.
Walker logged only 18 minutes during five 
NCAA Tournament games, but he had his best game of his short season in a 79-68 victory against UCLA in the Sweet 16 on March 27. Against the Bruins, he provided a spark off the bench by record-ing seven points, three rebounds and a block in six minutes of action.
But at times this year, Walker looked lost and 
out of position on the defensive end. An offseason under coach Billy Donovan should help the Bonifay native better understand UF’s defense and expand his post moves.  
Walker could earn a starting frontcourt role next 
year. 
The Gators lose 68.5 percent of their offensive 
production in their four seniors from 2013-14, but they return point guard Kasey Hill, shooting guard Michael Frazier II and forward Dorian Finney-Smith — three key players from a Gators rotation that won 36 games and reached its first Final Four since 2007. 
The Gators also bring back DeVon Walker, Jacob 
Kurtz and Rutgers transfer guard Eli Carter, who redshirted and sat out most of his 2013-14 campaign to let a fractured fibula in his right leg heal. 
Power forward Alex Murphy and center Damon-
tre Harris should add depth to Florida’s frontcourt, which loses a productive trio in Patric Young, Casey Prather and Will Yeguete. 
Murphy, a Duke transfer, cannot play until mid-
December unless he receives a waiver to play ear-lier, per NCAA transfer rules. 
Donovan dismissed Harris, a rim protector and 
dynamic shot-blocker, from the team last Decem-ber after the center violated team rules and failed to meet his responsibilities. But a regretful Harris, eager to work his way back onto the team, has re-turned to Florida and has practiced with the Gators since January.
Florida also adds Devin Robinson, Brandone 
Francis and Chris Chiozza — three players from Ri-vals.com’s top 50 for the Class of 2014 — to the mix next year. 
Donovan’s son of the same name, walk-on Lexx 
Edwards and Dillon Graham, who missed last sea-son with bone spurs in his hips, will vie for spots in the rotation.
Barring any injuries, Florida enters 2014-15 with 
a deep roster — especially now with Chris Walker back in the fold.Walker announces decision to

No. 6 Florida held a 2-1 lead heading 
into the seventh inning against No. 8 Flori-
da State in Tallahassee on Wednesday.
Seminoles pitcher Lacey Waldrop, who 
was second in the nation with a 0.70 ERA heading into the contest, gave up only two hits while striking out seven batters head-ing into the final frame.
But with two outs and Stephanie Tofft 
on second base, junior Bailey Castro pinch hit for Kathlyn Medina.With Florida hoping to put some insur-
ance runs on the board, Castro delivered.
Facing a 3-1 count, the Pembroke Pines 
native belted a home run to left-center field to lift the Gators  to a 4-1 lead over the Seminoles.
Florida’s defense gave up a second run 
in the bottom of the final frame, but the Gators (35-8, 8-7 Southeastern Conference) ultimately ended up winning the contest against the Seminoles (38-5, 14-2 Atlan-tic Coast Conference) 4-2 at JoAnne Graf Field. 
“Bailey’s hit obviously really helped us because we kind of fell apart there in the end,” coach Tim Walton said in a radio in-terview. 
“But overall, that’s 
the name of the game. … Sometimes nerves get the best of you. 
The team that gets the most hits with run-ners in scoring position typically is going to be the team that wins.”
After three scoreless innings, which 
included just one hit and five total strike-outs, Florida found success in the fourth frame.
Kelsey Stewart opened the inning by 
grounding out to third, but Briana Little drew a five-pitch walk to give the Gators a baserunner. Sophomore Kirsti Merritt followed Little with a single to left-center field.
Lauren Haeger subsequently struck 
out, but Tofft took a full-count walk at the next at-bat to load the bases.
Taylor Schwarz took care of business 
from there.
Facing a 1-1 count, the Palm Beach Gar-
dens native ripped the ball through the left side to score Little and Merritt and put Florida on the board first. 
With the single, Schwarz became the 
fifth Florida batter this season to accumu-late 25 RBIs.

in her 17th victory of the season 
three hits on the night, Walton 
thought the Gators made plays when they needed to.
“On offense, we got a couple 
good hits,” Walton said. 
“Schwarz got a really nice 
one and Bailey’s pinch hit was really clutch.”
In the circle, Hannah Rog-
ers earned her 17th win of the season after throwing her 13th complete game this season. 
The Lake Wales native gave up just ﬁ  ve hits and struck out four batters to bring her total to 99 on the season.
“Hannah was the biggest 
difference,” Walton said. “I mean, she had some good stuff tonight, really made pitches when she had to. She gave up a couple walks, but really got on some hands, got some balls off the end of the bat and really commanded the zone.”
Florida, now riding a four-
game win streak, will look to keep its momentum going into non-conference matchups against Florida A&M on Friday and North Carolina State on Saturday.
“We’re playing, and I think 
that’s important,” Walton said. 
“We’re not just going about 
practice and doing intersquads. We’re getting on the ﬁ  eld. … At the end of the day, the most important part for our players is just to stay in shape and keep their eyes and their timing right for the next series we have to play.”

It’s not easy to get better when you’re al-
ready one of the most talented cornerbacks in 
the nation. 
That’s what sophomore Vernon Har-
greaves III is facing in 2014. Even after record-ing three interceptions and 11 pass breakups as a freshman, he has some ideas on how to improve. 
“I just need to be a better leader,” the Tam-
pa native said. “A lot of guys are looking up to me now, a lot of freshman corners we have now. Just being a better leader and staying on top of my game.”
Hargreaves is setting an example for the 
secondary, which is reloading this season to ﬁ  ll the voids of NFL Draft prospects Marcus Roberson, Loucheiz Purifoy and Jaylen Wat-kins. True freshmen Duke Dawson and Jalen Tabor are ﬁ  ghting for the corner spot opposite Hargreaves. Hargreaves knows what it’s like to have high expectations in year one. 
“You’ve just got to focus. Focus on what 
you can do because it’s hard and coming at you fast, especially with the up-tempo offense we have,” he said. “Everything is faster than what it usually goes. I tell them to be focused. Everything else will take care of itself.”Hargreaves’ father, Vernon Jr., is the cur-
rent linebackers coach at Houston. Prior to Houston, he coached defensive ends and spe-cial teams at USF for three seasons and was on Connecticut’s staff for 13 years. Growing up as a coach’s son helped shape Hargreaves into the player he is today.
“I’ve been around football for as long as I can remember,” Hargreaves said. “Being around, when my dad coached at Miami, I was around all those great players like Ed Reed, Sean Taylor. I was around all them. I remember how hard they used to work and compete. I took that from them.”
A professional opportunity for defensive 
backs at Florida exists — a number of proﬁ  -cient players under coach Will Muschamp and defensive backs coach Travaris Robinson have succeeded at the next level. Some notables in-clude Baltimore Raven Matt Elam, Jacksonville Jaguar Josh Evans and Roberson and Purifoy. 
“Coach Muschamp and Coach T-Rob 
know a lot of players, Muschamp’s coached in the league. They know what it’s like and our defense is based on a NFL scheme,” Har-greaves said. 
“(Former defensive coordinator) Dan 
Quinn is at the Seahawks now, he coached last year, he knows a lot of the stuff that we do. We base a lot of our stuff off of what he does, so it’s just a great opportunity.” 
Saturday marks Florida’s annual Orange 
and Blue Debut, a chance to give fans a glimpse of things to come for the season. The All-SEC corner knows a thing or two about making a good ﬁ  rst impression. 
“Coach Muschamp is kind of emphasizing 
on ﬁ  rst impressions,” Hargreaves said. 
“We’re just going to go out there, have fun 
show a lot of effort, a lot of enthusiasm, try to execute as best as we can. Whatever happens, happens.”Hargreaves stepping up as he enters second season at UF
