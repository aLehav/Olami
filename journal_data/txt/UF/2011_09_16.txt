  Dan Wenger doesn’t remember much 
about Aug. 13, 2010, a day that changed his life.
  It began like most August days of the pre-
vious four years: The then-ﬁ  fth-year senior woke up, suited up for preseason camp and took the practice ﬁ  eld at Notre Dame. His next memory was going to a hospital. 
  What happened in between is still fuzzy for 
the 6-foot-3, 294-pound offensive lineman.
  “I don’t recall the hit, don’t recall anything 
that happened,” Wenger said. “Just remember going to the hospital and getting some tests done and feeling some residual effects.”
  Wenger suffered a concussion — the ﬁ  rst of 
his career — during team drills.
  He was held out of practice before eventu-
ally returning to the Fighting Irish. 
  That is, until it happened again three and a 
half weeks later.
  The Coral Springs native sustained two 
concussions, and now his future, both on and off the ﬁ  eld, was shrouded in questions.
  “Dan’s involved in that decision, [and] 
Dan’s family,” Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said at the time. 
“We should be very cautious with anybody 
that’s had two concussions in a very short period of time. Right now, we have to be ex-tremely conservative when we have a young man that hasn’t had game contact and has suf-fered two concussions.”
  Nearly a month later, Notre Dame’s medi-
cal staff still hadn’t cleared Wenger. He went to the University of Michigan to be evaluated by a specialist, seeking a clean bill of health.
  No luck.  The following day, Kelly ruled Wenger out 
for the season.
  “It was extremely tough,” Wenger said. 
“It’s one of those things where I’ve been work-ing for this since I was a freshman in high school. … It was heartbreaking. It was devas-tating to get that news. And I wasn’t sure what I was going to do.”
      When Wenger went down with his ﬁ  rst 
concussion, he became as much as four times more likely to sustain a second one.
  The recovery time for concussions can 
vary from person to person, but according to Dr. Duane Dede, an expert in neuropsychol-ogy and mild traumatic brain injuries at UF, it typically takes about a week for symptoms to subside before an athlete can return to physi-cal activity.
  After multiple concussions, the recovery 
time can increase and athletes are more vul-nerable to future concussions.
Following   Wenger’s second concussion, 
the effects lingered.
  At ﬁ  rst, there were constant headaches. 
Then, he had trouble sleeping.
  “When I would go to sleep I would wake 
up with a headache, sleep nine, 10 hours thinking I was getting enough rest but I wasn’t,” Wenger said. “Then I’d be dragging all through the day and be exhausted.”
  Because of the second concussion, Wenger’s 
sleep patterns were off. He saw a neurologist and was eventually provided medication, al-lowing him a full night’s rest.
  Beyond the residual effects, Wenger is now 
at risk for other, lasting repercussions down the road.
  Studies such as the one carried out by 
UNC’s Center for the Study of Retired Ath-letes have shown that multiple concussions can accelerate the decline of an athlete’s cog-nitive functions and can increase the risk of developing dementia,   and other psychiatric conditions, such as depression.
  “When you go through a concussion the 
emotions run wild,” Wenger said. “That’s one thing: It’s a roller-coaster ride. One day it’s great, one day it’s bad and you contemplate is it worth it? Is it not?”
  
  
  After he was sidelined all of last season, 
Wenger had doubts he would ever play again.
  Was it worth the risk of sustaining a third 
concussion? What impact would it have on his future beyond the game of football?
  But Wenger eventually looked past the 
what-ifs.
  “Once you get over that … it’s one of those 
things that this is instilled in me and it’s in-stilled in me to keep ﬁ  ghting and I’m going to keep ﬁ  ghting.”
  So he did.  After applying for another season of eligi-
bility with the NCAA, Wenger was granted a sixth year — but it wouldn’t be at Notre Dame. 
  Kelly and the Irish medical staff would not 
allow Wenger to play.
  “In good conscience, we just couldn’t clear 
him,” Kelly said in March. “I met with Dan and his family and let them know where we stood. But the young man still wants to play, and I’m not going to stand in the way of that.”
  Notre Dame gave Wenger his release pa-
pers and the former four-star prospect reached out to some familiar faces back in his home state.
  Wenger called up his offensive line coach 
at Notre Dame, Frank Verducci, who was now in Gainesville as a part of Will Muschamp’s in-augural staff. Wenger wanted to play for Ver-ducci and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis, who was Wenger’s coach his ﬁ  rst four years in South Bend, Ind.
  Verducci passed Wenger’s interest along to 
Weis and Muschamp, who were both on board with the idea — as long as Florida’s medical staff could clear Wenger.
  During his ofﬁ  cial visit to the school, 
Wenger underwent seven hours of tests — both medical and cognitive — to see if he had lingering effects from his concussions. 
  “Cognitive testing is important because it’s 
the yardstick for what the brain has to do,” said Dede, co-director of the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic at UF’s Heal Science Cen-ter.
  Wenger later had to drive back up to 
Gainesville to undergo further testing before he was ﬁ  nally cleared.
  “If he couldn’t play a down, he would have 
still helped us tremendously because he knows the offense better than the rest of them,” Weis said. “Even if he couldn’t physically hold up, his intangibles are through the roof.”
  
    For all the examinations Wenger under-
went, the real test for the once-highly touted prospect came in August on the muggy Flori-da practice ﬁ  elds.
  After taking a year off, Wenger and Flori-
da’s staff weren’t sure how he would respond to taking hits on the ﬁ  eld again.
  But those uncertainties were quickly allevi-
ated when two-a-days began.
  “When we started hitting and put on pads 
and everything like that, that was the true test,” Wenger said. “I was able to withstand work-outs going through the summer with (strength and conditioning) coach [Mickey Marotti] and those guys. The real test was in summer camp. Passed that with ﬂ  ying colors.”
  Not only did Wenger pass, but he quickly 
earned himself a starting spot along the Gators’ offensive line, where he played the ﬁ  rst two games of the season at left guard.
  Although he transferred from Notre Dame, 
Wenger quickly endeared himself to his fel-low linemen, who have all said he has been instrumental in helping them adjust to Weis’ offense and Verducci’s blocking schemes.
  “He’s the wise man of the offensive line,” 
right guard Jon Halapio said. “He knows ev-ery call there is. We felt really comfortable with him out there calling all the calls, and just running to the ball and being the leader out there.”
  With the help of Wenger, Florida’s offen-
sive line has not allowed a sack this season, making the Gators one of only 10 teams in the country to keep its quarterback on his feet. 
Florida   is also pounding the rock, rushing 
for more than 248 yards per game — second in the Southeastern Conference.
  Now, with a fresh start, Wenger is putting 
what happened last fall behind him.
  “It’s one of those things that’s been in the 
past,” Wenger said. “It’ll always be there, that memory of when it happened last year. But when it’s out there on the ﬁ  eld, it’s strictly football.”

  After a year’s hiatus, the fair is back in town.  The Alachua County Fair, canceled in 2010 for 
the ﬁ  rst time in 40 years due to ﬁ  nancial problems, has paid its debts and will open its gates once more in October.
  “There’s been a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff 
going on since April,” said Steve White, the own-er of Event Marketing Corp., the marketing ﬁ  rm hired to manage the fair. “But there will be a fair this year.”
  In April 2009, the Alachua County Fair Associa-
tion was denied its proposal to renew its lease of the county-owned fairgrounds at Northeast 39th Avenue and Waldo Road.
  The nonproﬁ  t fair association owed money to 
outside vendors and cattle exhibitors.
  The association also failed to submit a required  County fair

  Elmo, Big Bird and Cookie Mon-
ster are spending a couple of days in 
Gainesville next week.  A Broadway-style production of 
Sesame Street will be performed at the O’Connell Center at 10:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Tuesday and at 7 p.m. on Wednesday.
  Ticket prices range from $30 for ﬂ  oor and lower-level seats to $13 for upper-level seats.
  The show has been coming to 
the O’Connell Center almost every year for the past 25 years, said Re-nee Musson, associate director of the O’Connell Center. 
  Sesame Street rents the O’Connell 
Center for its  performances, which are geared toward the Gainesville community.
  The O’Connell Center director 
was not available to comment on the rental price at press time.
  Only a small percentage of the 
audience members are UF students, and most students bring a younger family member, Musson said.
  Exploratory liberal arts sopho-
more Anthony Cardona thinks stu-dents should consider seeing the production.
  “Why not see it? It’s shaped 
thousands of childhoods,” Cardona said. “Everyone would love to re-visit that.”  Sesame Street takes stage at O’Connell Center next week

  Fans driving home after the UF football game against 
the University of Tennessee had best not drink a few beers 
before they get behind the wheel: Law enforcement agen-cies will have extra ofﬁ  cers on the roads watching for drunken drivers.
  The Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce and other local 
law enforcement agencies will join forces to beef up the night’s DUI patrol beginning at 8 p.m. Saturday and end-ing at 4 a.m. Sunday, according to a sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce news release. 
  The Gainesville Police Department, University Police, 
High Springs Police Department, Alachua Police Depart-ment and Florida Highway Patrol will also be involved in the nighttime patrol. 
  “We want to make sure everybody … gets home from the game safely,” said Art Forgey, ASO public information ofﬁ  cer.
  With crowds of Gators and Volunteers fans coming 
to Gainesville for the UF football match against the Uni-versity of Tennessee, people are more likely to engage in alcohol-related activities such as partying, he said. 
  The Saturday night patrol will not include any check-
points, Forgey said. 
  An increased number of ofﬁ  cers will, however, be pa-
trolling the area during the DUI detail, he said. Law enforcement plans to boost DUI patrol this gameday weekend

A UF music professor was fired in 
January for allegedly forcing a kiss upon 
a female student during a private lesson, and an arbitrator recently declared the decision to fire him sound after hearing an appeal from the United Faculty of Florida.
The union appealed the dismissal 
on behalf of Arnold Irchai, a world-re-nowned bassoonist and associate profes-sor of music, arguing that the university did not follow due process when it con-sidered previous claims against him.
According to arbitrator Leslie Lang-bein’s report, two other similar claims of sexual harassment had been filed against Irchai since he was hired in 2002.
Of the two prior 
complaints, one was dropped by the stu-dent, and the other was investigated but yielded inconclusive evidence.
UF spokeswoman 
Janine Sikes said the reason Irchai was not 
dismissed for any of those prior incidents is the students did not want to proceed with charges, but “in each case there was a disciplinary process.”Irchai was meeting with the third stu-
dent for a private lesson last September when he allegedly grabbed her face and kissed her, according to the ruling. The student pushed him away and left his office crying. She told a friend what hap-pened, and they reported it to the under -
graduate adviser and music school direc-tor John Duff.
Duff was unavailable to comment at 
press time.
Irchai denied that he kissed or touched 
the student in their meeting and said that she was simply nervous for an upcoming concert and worried about her perfor -
mance in class, according to the report.
The incident was reported to and in-
vestigated by the Office of Institutional Equality and Diversity, and Irchai was fired Jan. 10.

The Gainesville chapter of Students for a Demo-
cratic Society will march to Tigert Hall this morning to 
protest the 15 percent tuition increase passed in June by UF’s Board of Trustees.
This spring, state legislators approved an 8 percent 
tuition increase and allowed universities to make addi-tional increases up to 7 percent, which UF did. 
SDS lead organizers Robbey Hayes and Michela 
Martinazzi believe the tuition hikes are unfair and un-necessary , saying UF administration should dig into its endowment before putting further financial strain on students in the current economy . 
“It’s unfair to put that burden on the backs of the 
students,” Hayes said. 
Students will rally on Turlington Plaza at 11:30 
a.m. and march to Tigert Hall, where they hope to talk to Provost Joe Glover. SDS members have collected enough student signatures to get a referendum ques-tion on the ballot during Student Government elections this month. 
Hayes and Martinazzi said they expect 200 to 300 
students to show up for the march based on attendance at similar events in the past. Students protest

Due to the recent closing of the post office in down-
town Gainesville, the Alachua County Supervisor of 
Elections Office has changed its mailing address.
Mail will now be sent to 111 SE First Ave., the current 
location of the Supervisor of Elections Office.
Previously, all mail addressed to the supervisor of 
elections was sent to a mailbox in the post office down-town. 
The post office box was used because it was a perma-nent address that could be put on all supervisor of elec-tions printed materials sent to voters, said Pam Carpen-ter, supervisor of elections. 
“When the post office downtown closed, we re-evalu-
ated that situation and thought the best and easiest thing was to just have our mail sent directly to our office,” Car -
penter said.  
Registered voters may change their information on-
line at elections.alachua.fl.us. If a document requires the voter’s signature, it can be printed and sent to the new mailing address or dropped in the mail drop box located in the office’s front door. Supervisor of Elections gets new addressUnion appeal to arbitrator failed

In a room slightly larger than 
an office supply closet, Robbie 
Stevens broadcasts radio waves of wailing saxophones, blaring trumpets and pounding drums over the Internet. 
Stevens, 42, is the host of 
Jazzville, a jazz radio show that launched Saturday on growra-dio.org.
Grow Radio is a local non-
profit Internet radio station. 
Jazzville airs each Saturday 
from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m on the web-site. 
WXJZ is the only other radio 
station in Gainesville that plays jazz, and it plays only smooth jazz, Stevens said.
Jazzville features a range of 
styles, from some of the earli-est traditional jazz through big band, be-bop, hard bop, modern jazz and even some jazz fusion.
“I’ll let the music speak for 
itself, but occasionally I will in-clude stories of interest on musi-cal artists and recording technol-ogy,” said Stevens, who works at the Phillips Center for the Per -
forming Arts during the week.
Jazz is an important genre to 
share with long-time fans and new listeners because it is a true American treasure, Stevens said.
A musician himself, Stevens plays the drums and studied at Berklee College of Music in Bos-ton. 
Growing up, Stevens also had 
a jazz musician for a father. His father has now donated his en-tire vinyl collection to the radio show.“When you think about it, 
[jazz is] the soundtrack for our country in the last 100 years through Prohibition and the Roaring ‘20s, World War II, the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War,” he said. “It’s now an important part of the world culture.”
Artists featured on Jazzville 
include important players in jazz history, such as Louis Arm-strong, John Coltrane and Herbie Hancock.
Jazz vocalists such as Frank Si-
natra, Sarah Vaughan and  Harry Connick Jr., as well as current artists like Kenny Garret, Chris-tian Scott and Vijay Iyer are also featured.
In the future, Stevens hopes 
to interview local jazz musicians and others who are stopping by to perform in Gainesville. 
Bill Bryson, Grow Radio sta-
tion manager, launched the In-ternet radio station two years ago to do exactly what Jazzville does: provide a variety of music unavailable on local FM.
Bryson said he wanted to fill 
the void of a traditional college radio in Gainesville. 
Other Grow Radio stations in-
clude metal, hip-hop, experimen-tal, talk and boogie and blues.
Grow Radio’s programming 
comes from music lovers who have the freedom to play music they are excited about, he said.
Listeners can stream content 
from growradio.org in real time, download an iPhone or smart-phone app for playback on the go, or download the shows as podcasts to listen to in the future, Bryson said.
The station is staffed by vol-
unteer DJs who host an assort-ment of shows with  music from different genres for, but not lim-ited to, the Gainesville commu-nity, Stevens said.
“The most important part of 
being a fan and a listener is that you continue to grow and dis-cover new artists,” Stevens said. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

released a balloon into the sky?Today’s question: Are you excited that the fair is return-

We’ve made it through another week. 
All of you have surely dived, headfirst, into your classes 
this semester, and this weekend will probably be a chance for some of you to relax a bit and recharge for next week.
Like you, we’re taking it easy this week with our weekly 
awards editorial, and hopefully you’ll have some laughs as you head to and from class. 
So, alas, we begin our according-to-some-no-one-takes-
the-editorial-section-seriously-anyway edition of...
Darts and Laurels
First, we are giving an it’s-time-to-get-some-funnel-
cake-then-regret-it-later LAUREL to Alachua County for 
bringing back the county fair. 
Last year, due to unpaid debts, the fair had to take a 
year off. Now it is back and should provide some entertain-ment in this often uneventful town. 
Most students have probably heard about student-
professor relationships, and perhaps the recipient of our way-to-be-a-creeper DART got jealous. Music professor 
Arnold Irchai’s firing was recently upheld by an arbitrator after he was let go for forcing a kiss on one of his students. How desperate do you have to be? 
A recent report indicates that a high-profile politician 
might also have had a college fling, but with a high-profile athlete. 
This particular politician is often associated with racism, 
so the target of her youthful attraction could be surprising to some. 
That’s why we’re shooting an ebony-and-ivory LAU-
REL to Sarah Palin for allegedly hooking up with basket-

However, there is a court case we can all get behind. 
We’re throwing an it’s-about-time LAUREL to Circuit 
Judge Belvin Perry for forcing Casey Anthony to fork over $100,000 to pay for the cost of investigating her daughter’s case. Anthony led the police on a wild goose chase, costing everyone involved tons of time and money. To some, this might not be justice, but it sure is sweet. 
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back

From the start of the modern education reform move-
ment, presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have addressed educa-
tion in different ways. However the primary issue remains the same. Education was, and still is, in need of dramatic reform. 
In today’s economic climate, it is easy to get lost in im-
mediate issues that seem to take precedence over the one institution that can help alleviate many of our troubles: education. It is important that we take education out of the convoluted context in which it is entrapped today.
America’s flawed education system has caused students 
relentless anger, increasing hostility and, most importantly, hopelessness toward an academic institution they were once so excited to join. 
Somewhere between spending hundreds of dollars on 
textbooks and paying the part of tuition that our scholar -
ships no longer cover — or the entire cost of attendance for those who don’t have scholarships — we have become stu-dents more interested in saving money than pursuing the optimal quality of education. 
Isn’t college supposed to fulfill our desire to obtain a 
valuable educational experience?  
Somewhere along the road of this thorny recession, stu-
dents have lost a sense of belonging. The passion that was once there to become a doctor, lawyer, scientist or teacher is replaced by a fear that the job prospects may not be suf-ficient to return the amount spent on the degrees. 
In our individualistic society, such a fear is especially 
daunting.  
But why should we have to attend college with a dis-
gruntled attitude? Waking up for the first day of school is no longer coupled with a sense of excitement and adven-ture; instead, it is met with disdain toward the fact that we are throwing our savings into this investment. 
Can anyone see what is missing here? The motivation 
is dying. The ambition is being compromised. Financial resources have not been prop-erly allocated toward universities and, as we all know, money dic-tates everything. 
Without money, schools are 
left with a myriad of issues that ultimately hinder a student’s abil-ity to learn. Without a strong edu-cation system, we will not breed strong students. Inevitably, weak 
students will only create a weak future for our country.
The virtue of education has been lost.  To a certain degree, it is reasonable to point the finger at 
U.S. cultural attitudes and attribute the failure of our edu-cation system to the shift in values that has come with our rising generation. 
Despite this claim, we still cannot overlook the scarcity 
of financial resources in the education sector. Even if our societal values do not revere education as much as other countries, nothing will improve unless we start implement-ing more funds toward education. 
Even though identifying the underlying cause of our 
struggling education system is complex and often unwar -
ranted, one thing is certain: America is lagging. 
And we won’t get anywhere by advocating for an inac-
tive government to deal with our troubles. 
Education must be the target of reform and, in order for 
this to happen, we need strong leadership. 
The government must take an active and aggressive role 
in addressing the issues of our education system. Congress needs to be less concerned with interest groups and more concerned with nationwide cries for help. 
Let us not lose sight of the purpose of this profound and 
meaningful institution. Let us not strip students of their right to excel and provide for their country.

Do you let your cat roam free 
outside? 
If you answered yes, you 
are one of the millions of cat owners in the U.S. who is persuaded by his or her feline friends to let them roam outdoors.  Outside, they can wreak havoc on wildlife and put their own precious little lives in grave danger.
One cat that won the argument 
impacted my life forever. 
I was coming home one day and 
could hear the high-pitched scream-ing of some small animal. I looked around, trying to locate the source of the sound, and noticed a collared cat, mid-tree, with a baby squirrel in its mouth. 
This is one of the many reasons 
why letting your cat outdoors causes problems. In terms of ecological and environmental reasons, there is a wide consensus that outdoor and feral cats are a huge problem to na-tive wildlife populations. 
It is known that well-fed cats 
prey upon songbirds, certain small game birds, small mammals, lizards, snakes, amphibians and insects. 
In Florida, it is believed that cats 
prey upon rare and endangered species such as the piping plover and the Florida scrub jay . 
Research on domestic cats has 
shown that their hunting instinct is very different from their eating behaviors: A well-fed cat will still hunt. 
Darin  
Schroeder, the vice 
president of   conservation advocacy for the American Bird Conservancy, noted that about 500 million birds alone are killed by outdoor cats per year in the United States. 
One study found outdoor cats 
were the cause of a large portion ofgray catbird deaths. Of the 42 deaths of the study’s radio-tagged gray catbirds, 80 percent of mortal-ity was caused by predation. 
Other problems associated with 
outdoor cats include their role as vectors for disease transmission. It has been found that free-roaming cats are a risk for the transfer of sal-monella, among other  diseases, to humans.
There are many humanistic and 
moralistic reasons to keep your fe-line friends indoors. 
The main reason, however, is 
that you would significantly in-crease your pet’s life expectancy . Studies have shown indoor cats live an average of 15 years while out-door cats rarely live more than five years.  
By keeping your cat indoors, you 
would be avoiding violent interac-tions between your pet and traffic and violent encounters between dogs, raccoons, coyotes and other animals. 
By keeping your pet inside, you 
would be decreasing their risk of exposure to many diseases like ra-bies, feline leukemia and distemper, while simultaneously preventing the spread of parasites like worms, ticks, mites and fleas into your home. 
There are important lifestyle 
changes to consider when solving the ecological problems associated with cats. 
First, you can humanly trap feral 
or untagged cats and bring them to the local animal shelter. 
Second, you can systematically 
place bird feeders or baths in open areas with no cat hiding places.
Third, if you insist on subject-
ing your pet to the dangers of out-side, make sure your pet has some kind of noise-making device to alert wildlife of its presence.  
Fourth, try to keep your cat in-
doors, at least at night, due to the increased vulnerability of wildlife. 
Finally , support legislation for 
cat registration, control and protec-tion plans.

Speaking Out
The significant changes 
and new challenges in the Middle East are 
sending a clear and direct message to the state of Israel — the days of violating inter -
national law are over. 
Perhaps the most symbolic 
challenge to Israel’s policy is the Palestinians’ declaration to pursue the Israeli-Palestin-ian case before the United Na-tions later this month. 
The word “symbolic” 
should be stressed, as the U.N. Security Council’s ac-tual approval of a potential Palestinian state shouldn’t be anticipated.
What should be appar -
ent, however, is that this is a message sent toward Israel — there will be no more em-barrassing concessions such as those apparent in the in-famous Palestinian Papers. Though there are still differ -
ences between the various parties in the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian cause will be unquestionably legiti-mized. 
The likely acceptance of a two-thirds ma-j o r i t y 
vote in the General Assembly will lead to the categorization of Palestine as an “observer state” — or further, bring Is-rael to the International Crim-inal Court for the various violations of international law such as the illegal blockade of Gaza, the construction of an illegal barrier, construction of illegal settlements and other violations.
According to Al-Jazeera, 
the Young Mizrahis — Jews of Middle Eastern and North Af-rican origins — is one Israeli group saluting the current up-risings in the Middle East. 
In an open letter, the Miz-
rahis states, “We have faith in intra-regional dialogue … as a catalyst towards renewing the Andalusian model of Muslim-Jewish-Christian partnership, God willing, Inshallah.” And I reaffirm, Inshallah.

Gators fans flooding into Gainesville for 
home football games this season will face strict 
reservation rules at some hotels — including a two-night booking minimum.
The Hilton University of Florida Confer -
ence Center requires a minimum two-night stay on home football game weekends for high-demand games like the University of Tennessee and University of Alabama con-tests, said David Burgraff, director of sales for the hotel. 
Hotel guests must reserve a room for both 
Friday and Saturday night on those week-ends. 
“We’d be doing ourselves a disservice if we 
sold out on a Friday night but not a Saturday night,” Burgraff said.
The requirement is geared to help the Hil-
ton meet the massive demand for rooms on these weekends and maximize its occupancy.
The Hilton also requires people to prepay 
for their rooms 45 days in advance.
“I guess those who complain about it just 
don’t book with us,” he said. “[As for] the people who are here — I’m assuming they’re OK with it since they’re putting their money down.”
Rates vary, although they are usually high-
er for weekends where the Gators play prime opponents, Burgraff said.
Staff at some hotels said these minimums 
could be waived for games that draw smaller crowds, such as the recent Gators matches against Florida Atlantic University and Uni-versity of Alabama at Birmingham.
Kelly Nutt, a third-year zoology major at 
UF, said her parents attended two football games last year and stayed in local hotels.
They didn’t like the two-night minimum 
requirement because they like to save money when possible, she said.
But they made the best of their weekend 
stays, she said, by spending time with their daughter. 
“They couldn’t really do anything about it, 
so they might as well take advantage of it,” she said.  
Her mother has stayed at her apartment on 
solo visits. But when both of her parents come to Gainesville, they stay in hotels because Nutt doesn’t want to burden her two roommates with the extra guests, she said — especially since she and one of her roommates share a bathroom. 
She said their favorite hotel to stay at in 
Gainesville is Cabot Lodge.While visiting for the UF Homecoming 
game this year, she said, her parents will spend time with Nutt and her sister Cara, a freshman.
The Sweetwater Branch Inn, a Gainesville 
bed and breakfast, also has a two-night mini-mum for most game weekends, said Rhea Looney, reservations manager at the inn.
Guests can choose whether to spend their 
two required nights on a Friday , Saturday or Sunday.
The inn will sometimes drop its two-day 
requirement as the game date nears, depend-ing on the expected occupancy. No prepaid deposits are required, but there is a strict can-cellation policy . 
“Sometimes people will call a year ahead, 
and then within a week of a reservation they’ll cancel,” Looney said. 
If a person wishes to cancel after making 
the reservation, they must pay a $10 cancella-tion fee at the inn.
When people cancel less than 30 days be-
fore their reservation date, they must pay the room costs in full, she said.
The full-payment requirement may be 
waived if there are extreme circumstances, such as a death in the family or if people find replacements to fill the now-empty room, she said. 
The Holiday Inn University Center also has 
a two-night minimum requirement for home game weekends, said Trusha Jariwala, a guest services representative at the hotel. 
People must book both Friday and Satur -
day night on those dates. There is also a 30-day cancellation policy for reservations.
The Laurel Oak Inn, another Gainesville 
bed and breakfast, also has a two-night mini-mum that requires customers to book Friday and Saturday nights on home game week-ends, although sometimes the inn may make exceptions for Saturday and Sunday reserva-tions, said owner Monta Burt. 
The inn also has a 30-day cancellation pol-
icy, after which people must pay for rooms in full. If people cancel 31 days or more before their reservation date, there is a $50 process-ing fee. 
Cancellation costs are waived if the inn is 
able to re-book the room with a new occupant, Burt said. 
If a person does have to pay fees for cancel-
ing their reservation, they receive a gift card for their next visit, he said. 
Game weekend visitors face higher hotel rates, booking minimums
“They couldn’t really do anything 
about it, so they might as well take 
advantage of it.”

Library hours and transportation 
are hot topics in the upcoming fall 
Student Government elections.
The Students Party and the Unite 
Party included points in both cate-gories on their platforms. Platforms list the goals of parties, which they will advertise leading up to the Sept. 27 and 28 elections.
The Unite Party finalized its plat-
form Wednesday night. Students Party spokeswoman Carly Wilson said that while the party has re-leased its rough platform, members are still working on finalizing some points.
Both parties promised to increase 
library hours on campus, and the Unite Party specified that members will work to make one library open 24 hours a day.
Unite Party spokeswoman Chris-
tina Bonarrigo said the party hopes to be able to keep Library West open around the clock but the expenses of keeping such a large building open all day may be an issue.The Unite Party platform pledg-
es to expand scooter parking on campus, build bus stop awnings, in-
crease bicycle sig-
nage and aware-ness and increase the number of SNAP cars and pickup areas.
The Students 
Party platform promises to  ex-pand SNAP avail-
ability , add to weekend bus services and put GPS-equipped bus monitors at major stops and in residence halls. Wilson said lighting and safety are also concerns. 
Bonarrigo said Unite Party mem-
bers had students suggest platform ideas on whiteboards on Turlington Plaza on Tuesday and Wednesday.
“I think they wanted to see us 
actually do something tangible,” she said, referring to the physical im-provements students requested.
She said students were espe-
cially concerned with having hand sanitizer dispensers in residence halls and increasing the number of water fountains on campus. Both are on the Unite platform.  The Students Party platform em-phasizes transparency between stu-dents and SG as well as fighting cor -
ruption in SG. 
Wilson said SG should advertise 
openings in SG branch positions more and make application periods longer. 
She said Accent applications 
were available for less than a week during the summer.
“It’s clearly something that needs 
to be addressed,” she said.

A representative from the U.S. 
Postal Service came to Evinston on 
Thursday evening to hear residents’ concerns about the potential closing of Wood and Swink Old Store’s post office.
Carolyn Kirce, who represents 
north central Florida to the Postal Service, told residents that the post office is under consideration to be closed because of low workload, not necessarily because of cost. 
It takes a postal worker at Wood 
and Swink only two hours a day , on average, to perform his or her duties, which is not an effective return, she said.
One main concern presented 
by the 70 people who attended the meeting at Evinston United Method-ist Church was the historical status of the post office, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. 
Another concern was the in-
creased cost Evinston residents will endure if they are forced to pay for rural delivery or drive to Micanopy to pick up mail.
One man who spoke up at the 
meeting said he would have to travel 1,000 extra miles a year driving to and from Micanopy’s post office.
Residents stressed to Kirce that 
Wood and Swink is central to the cultural and historical identity of Evinston.
“There is no other facility in the 
state of Florida, from Pensacola to Key West, that is comparable to this,” said Bill Bowe, of Gainesville. “This doesn’t even belong to Evinston, it belongs to the entire state of Flori-da. The price is just too great not to maintain.” 
The voices of those who expressed 
their concerns were recorded in a file that will be taken to the Postal Service’s headquarters for consider -
ation. 
Kirce said residents’ comments 
will be taken into account during the Postal Service’s review of post offices slated for closure.
No date was given at the meet-
ing for when the Postal Service will make a decision about closing the post office.
Former owner Freddie Wood Jr. 
was adamant that closing a post of-fice that serves about 85 people isn’t a cost-effective choice for the postal service.
“I can’t see why this is costing the 
government so much,” he said. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 11

Before the butterflies in north 
central Florida take wing, one lo-
cal butterfly farm is inviting the public to celebrate the colorful creatures.
The first annual Florida Mon-arch Festival will be Sept. 24 at Greathouse Butterfly Farm on State Road 26 in Earleton, Fla. 
The festival will be held from 
10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and is free and open to the public. Parking will be by donation, said Ed Sherwood, the festival organizer. 
The owner of Greathouse But-
terfly Farm, Zane Greathouse, cre-ated the festival to bring attention to the steps that need to be taken to protect the monarch butterfly. The monarch population has di-minished in the last 50 years, Sher -
wood said. 
The monarch butterfly is known 
for its annual migration to high-al-titude forests in Mexico each win-ter. The forest ecosystems need to be preserved for the butterflies to continue to migrate there. 
The festival will feature lo-
cal vendors, arts and crafts, face painting, bungee jumping, pony rides, butterfly plant sales, local food and live acoustic music. 
There will also be a two-hour 
educational program with mon-arch experts to educate the public on the butterfly.
“The festival’s goal is to edu-
cate while having fun,” Sherwood said.Although the Butterfly Rainfor -
est at the Florida Museum of Nat-ural History has its own Butter -
flyFest in October, workers there think any festival that informs people about butterflies is a good thing.
“The more information we can 
provide about [pollinators] like butterflies and moths, the better,” said Paul Ramey, the assistant di-rector for marketing and public relations at the museum.

UF is looking to increase access to den-
tal care in Florida by expanding its dental 
school and producing more dentists.
The university’s plans were present-
ed for informational purposes before the Board of Governors, the governing body of the state university system, on Wednesday afternoon.
The plan for the College of Dentistry calls for an expansion of 80 students over five years and a renovation of the 40-year-old dental science building.
UF is asking for about $3.2 million in 
state funds for the first year to fund the renovation.
A report presented to the Board of 
Governors in June found that while the state doesn’t necessarily need more dentists, access needs to be improved throughout Florida’s 67 counties.
According to the report, 21 counties 
lack dental providers who take Medicaid due to the state’s low Medicaid dental re-imbursement rates.
The report found that too many den-
tists are concentrated in urban areas, like Miami-Dade and Broward counties, and access in Florida’s more rural counties is limited.
UF’s plan would cost $15.2 million 
over five years for educational and out-reach expenses.UF outlines new plan for 
dental school expansion� ABOUT 350 SETS OF BOOKS AND

More space for students in Library West 
could become available within a year as the 
library’s inventory sheds about 400 sets of low-use publications.
These publications are currently shelved but available online, according to Judy Rus-sell, dean of university libraries at UF.
Russell said about 350 sets of journals 
and periodicals have already been identi-fied for storage and 60 for potential recy-cling. 
She said the third floor’s reference sec-
tion may also be relocated to an off-site storage facility. 
Using additional storage is not new for 
UF.  The university already operates an off-site storage space known as the Auxiliary Library Facility and has received verbal ap-proval for the use of a second storage site, Russell said. 
The removed books will leave hundreds 
of square feet that will either be filled with collections from other UF libraries, such as the Architecture and Fine Arts Library, or remodeled to accommodate more students, Russell said. 
Parul Shanker, a 19-year-old psychol-
ogy major,  said she would love to see more space for students in the library.
“It’s already such a struggle to find 
space in Library West, and that is the most centralized place to study for me,” she said. “If you try to go to Library West during the popular evening hours, it is pretty much impossible to find a place to study.”
Russell said she expects to see collections 
moving out of Library West by October. Library West clears shelves to make room for students
“If you try to go to Library West 
during the popular evening hours, it 
is pretty much impossible to find a 
place to study.”

� UT LEADS CONFERENCE IN 
CONVERSION PERCENTAGE.
TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Tennessee is more than just 
Tyler Bray, despite what you 
have read this week.
Sure, the Volunteers’ quar -
terback leads the Southeastern Conference with 698 passing yards and seven touchdowns. And yes, Tennessee has a dy-namic one-two pass-catching punch in sophomore receivers Justin Hunter and Da’Rick Rog-ers.
But through two games, the 
Vols have run the ball 15 times more than they have put it in the air. 
While Tennessee has hit 
a couple of home runs in the passing game, most of its touch-downs have come at the end of long, methodical drives; the Vols lead the SEC in time of possession.
To keep them off the score-
board, the Gators’ young de-fensive backs have to pass their first test of the season. 
But just as important, No. 16 
Florida (2-0) will need to pre-vent Tennessee (2-0) from ex-tending drives. 
That means winning the bat-
tle on third down.
Third-down plays are always 
key, but they will be even more important Saturday at 3:30 p.m. when the Vols and the Gators storm Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in both teams’ conference open-er. 
Entering this week, Tennes-
see’s offense is 20-for-30 (66.7 percent) on third downs — best in the SEC. 
Florida’s defense, mean-
while, has held opponents to a 3-for-23 rate (13 percent) in those same situations — also best in the SEC.
For the Gators to have suc-cess, they need to handcuff the Volunteers by putting them in third-and-long situations. To do that, Florida will have to control the line of scrimmage and clog running lanes.
“Although their (passing) 
stats are really high, I think they do have a good run game, too,” defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. 
“Certainly, they’ll try to es-
tablish that.”
If that’s the case, senior     It’s that time of year again. 
We’re almost at the third Satur-
day in September, and that means 
a few things: We’re into the heart of 
the fall semester, the heat is almost bearable enough that we can walk across campus without a change of clothes, and Southeastern Conference football is finally upon us. 
LSU and Mississippi State got the 
party started Thursday night, and 
Florida’s annual clash with Tennes-see is Saturday, but we’re taking things in a different direction. 
Some say SEC football is a reli-
gion. With that in mind, we debate a true Holy War: Utah at BYU. 
Utah (+5) will assert their domi-
nance among the Mormon faithful because…
Utah left the Mountain West for 
the greener pastures of the newly formed Pac-12, but the Holy War rages on nonetheless. 
The U of U may not be named 
after the great Brigham Young, but it’s still the best school in the state he founded. 
So what if the Utes don’t have 
quite the Mormon concentration of BYU? They were there first, damnit, and they’ve won six of the last nine in the series to boot. 
Plus, I’ve got a bit of a personal 
stake in this one, since I said Utah was one of the teams that deserved to be ranked ahead of Florida in the “abomination” of a rally that led a certain online message board to dub me “The Worst Writer in alligator -
Sports History.” 
Don’t let me down, Utes!

Versatile personnel provide Weis desired edge
When Charlie Weis took over at Notre 
Dame, he said the Fighting Irish would have a “decided schematic 
advantage” over their opponents. 
After five seasons of underwhelming per -
formances, it became apparent this wasn’t the case, and Weis was fired.
Now, almost two years later and back in the 
college game as UF’s offensive coordinator, Weis finally has the edge he was looking for. 
Not because of a new playbook or a new 
system, but because of his personnel. 
With players like Trey Burton, Jeff Demps, 
Omarius Hines, Chris Rainey and Jordan Reed, Weis has the potential to line UF up in the ever-rare three-quarterback, three-running back, three-tight end, five-wide receiver set. 
So far this season, 
the Gators have run 
plays with an empty backfield and five wide-outs, a jumbo package with two backs and three tight ends, and almost everything in be-tween. And they can do almost all of it with the same core players. Chief among that group is Burton, whose 
position seems to change daily. He’s listed as a running back on the roster, has taken snaps at fullback, tight end and quarterback this sea-son, and has the skills to be a receiver. 
“A lot of years I’ve gone in and out of per -
sonnel groups,” Weis said, “to try to disguise running the same plays over and over. What Trey allows you to do is, a lot of those forma-tions that you get into with multiple wide re-ceivers, you can get into it with him.”

Which team has 
  the edge? 
Natalie Teer / Alligator Staffpick their play and personnel, one 
of the first things they do is look at the offensive huddle to see who’s on the field. If they see three or four wideouts, they might go nickel or dime. If it’s one or two receivers, they’ll probably go with their base 3-4 or 4-3. 
But against UF, they may as well 
just guess. 
With the aforementioned group 
of Burton, Demps, Hines, Rainey and Reed, the Gators can run any-thing from jumbo to empty with equal effectiveness. 
“To take one personnel group 
and be able to adjust it with multiple formations puts a lot of pressure on the defense and usually gives you a good tip for what they’re going to end up doing,” Weis said.While the value of satellite play-
ers like Demps and Rainey is obvi-ous, the people who get underrated in the offense are Burton, Hines and Reed. 
All three have wide receiver 
speed, hands and skills. But they also all have tight end size, with Hines the smallest of the bunch at 6-foot-2 and 220 pounds.
The advantage this versatility creates is exaggerated by UF’s hur -
ry-up, which effectively prevents defenses from making substitu-tions. 
The Gators can call an empty 
play with all five split out wide, and then sprint to the line and in-stantly run a two-back, three-tight end goal-line set without making a single substitution. 
If the defense tries to replace a 
few defensive backs with lineback-ers to counter the run set, it’s all too easy for UF to catch it in transition, maybe even drawing a penalty for 12 men on the field. 
What the offense may lack in 
talent or quarterback play it makes up for in deception. And with an of-fensive mind like Weis at the helm, defenses need to be wary.

GREG , from page 19Bostic: UF must stop run, 
then react to pass Saturday
running back Tauren Poole has a larger 
target on his back than Bray has on his. 
Poole leads Tennessee with 199 
yards on the ground, though he was not a factor in last year’s meeting, when he managed just 23 yards on 10 carries in a 31-17 Florida win — the Gators’ sixth straight win in the series.  
Still, while Poole stands just 5-foot-
10, he is a strong, 215-pound back who could give UF fits.
“They like to run the ball,” middle 
linebacker Jon Bostic said. 
“You can see it with that big offen-
sive line; we saw it on film. There are some big guys that like to get after it. Basically our main objective is to stop the run first, and then we’ll react to the pass.”
If the Florida defense can do so, if it 
can put Bray in obvious passing situa-tions, the Gators will have a much bet-ter shot at getting the Volunteers off the field. 
While Tennessee has been great on third downs overall, it has really only thrived in short-yardage situations, when the defense can’t sell-out for the pass.
Against Montana and Cincinnati, 
Tennessee was 16-for-19 (84 percent) on third downs of five yards or less, and 4-for-11 (36 percent) on all others.  
To get in those short-yardage situa-
tions, the Vols leaned on Poole and the running game more than the arm of Bray.
At the same time, Florida has not 
been tested on defense by either Florida Atlantic or UAB. 
Of the 23 third-down situations the 
defense has faced, only twice has the opposing team been within five yards of moving the chains. 
Florida stepped up and stuffed the 
run on both plays.
On Saturday, however, the defense 
would prefer not to find itself in those scenarios, because this time the Gators could get burned.

Pac-12, BYU was left high and dry as an independent. 
This marks the first time in 113 years the two schools 
play each other while not in the same conference. 
But BYU isn’t going to sulk about it. 
Instead, the Cougars will just think: What Would Jim-
mer Do? Then, they will proceed to stun the Utes with an unlikely bombardment of long plays. 
This is a team that took Texas to the limit last Saturday, 
and that’s saying something, even if Mack Brown lost one of his finest to the same vices that cost Brandon Davies his chance at March Madness glory. 
— TOM GREEN
Now, onto the picks!
In first with a 9-6 record is alligatorSports editor Tom 
“You mean I get to talk to girls?” Green, whose eyes lit 
up like the Fourth of July when telling colleagues about a story he’s supposedly putting together. Let’s hope those fine young ladies in the Lingerie Football League have a good lawyer — restraining orders are a complicated deal these days.
Tied with Tom at 9-6 is alligatorSports staff writer Ty-
ler “I need to start a business buying beer for high school kids” Jett, whose next career move is illegal and creepy, yet at the same time rewarding. You need to purchase a pickup truck, invest in jeans with unintentional holes in the knees and start wearing trucker hats backwards, but one day soon you will help a nervous 16-year-old get laid, Tyler. Next step, yourself. 
Sharing the top spot at 9-6 is FightinGators.com’s 
Cody “The ‘combed down’ hairstyle isn’t as easy as it looks” Jones, who apparently drives about 100 miles from Gainesville to Daytona to meet with his preferred hair -
stylist. Cody also flies to New York twice a month to buy striped polos from American Eagle.
Also in first at 9-6 is alligatorSports assistant editor 
Matt “My age is a science, not an art” Watts, who took offense both to suggestions that he looked older than 26, and to suggestions that he looked younger during a recent poker game. We’re sorry, old man. You look exactly 9,157 days old.
In fifth place with an 8-7 record, we have the Associ-
ated Press’ Mark “The bottom of my order is better than your cleanup hitter” Long, who spent Tuesday evening boasting about the all-star cast of writers who worked for him when he ran alligatorSports — back when JFK was still in office.
Also in fifth at 8-7 is alligatorSports staff writer Greg 
“Swine Flu ruined my life” Luca, who upgraded his date for the Bunnell High School Prom at the last minute be-cause his original lady fell victim to the en vogue infection of 2009. We’ve seen the Facebook pics from that night, and all we can say is, ‘Whatup, Erin MacDaniel!”
Also featured in the fifth-place deadlock at 8-7 is In-
sidetheGators.com’s Kyle “Has anybody seen my tinfoil hat?” Maistri, whose anti-government ramblings on 9/11 received about as much positive feedback as Ron Paul’s recent debate appearances. Don’t worry, Kyle, we aren’t coming for your civil liberties any time soon. 
And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 
7-8 is Mike “I’ve given 10 good years to this beat” DiRoc-co, who has decided to no longer attend Tuesday press conferences in order to spend quality time with the fam-ily. It’s either that, or he realized we were on to his affinity for Charlie Weis.

Despite a disappointing show-
ing at the NCAA Championships, 
the UF men’s golf team had a “dream season” last year, captur -
ing five tournament titles, includ-ing the 2011 Southeastern Confer -
ence Championship. 
But with three key departures, 
Florida’s rebuilding project will be on display in Chicago today at the Olympia Fields/Fighting Illini In-vitational hosted by the University of Illinois. 
The three-round tournament is 
held at Olympia Fields Country Club, on the storied North Course — location of two U.S. Opens. With a length more than 7,000 yards, it’s one of the tougher courses on the Gators’ schedule. 
As usual, the field is loaded, 
featuring five of the nation’s top 10 teams. 
“This will definitely be one of 
the better fields we see and one of our biggest challenges,” coach Buddy Alexander said. 
The Gators won last year’s event 
and finished every round atop the leaderboard.
Alexander said he expects the 
upperclassmen to move up the ladder and fill the leadership roles left by the departures of Bank Vongvanij, Phillip Choi and An-dres Echavarria. 
Among them are juniors Tyler 
McCumber and T.J. Vogel and se-nior Michael Furci. 
McCumber made 91 birdies and 
finished last year with the fourth-lowest stroke average on the team (73.7). 
Vogel, a transfer from South-
ern California, finished last season with a 73.42 stroke average.
“[T.J.] struggled a little bit last 
year, but seems to be regaining his confidence,” Alexander said. 
“He’s got the talent, he’s got 
the game and a lot of experience as well.”
The team also added four fresh-
man recruits including J.D. Tom-linson — ranked 10th in the class of 2011 by the American Junior Golf Association — Thomas Stew-art, James Monnerville and Eric Banks.
Vogel is set to play No. 1 in the 
rotation today.  Tomlinson, Mc-Cumber, Furci and junior Tommy Mou will round out the remainder of the lineup. 
Alexander said the Gators are 
excited to begin the season, but are still keeping everything in per -
spective.
“There’s always a lot of excite-
ment and energy at the beginning of the year,” he said. 
“The real challenge is to try to 
have that kind of enthusiasm all year long for every tournament. But right now, they’re all fired up and ready to go.”22, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2011

Nerves should be high as Florida kicks off its fall sea-
son today at the Gator Invitational at the Ring Tennis Com-
plex.
But truthfully, they won’t be.To the Gators, this weekend’s slate of matchups against 
South Florida, Central Florida and Florida Atlantic may as well be just another three days of practice.
“It doesn’t count in the teams’ wins and losses,” junior 
Bob van Overbeek said. “Although the three teams are all good enough on a given day to beat anyone, we try to look at it as practice, and I’m sure they are too, because it’s the first event of the year.”
It also doesn’t hurt that nearly the entire team has re-
turned to compete for UF this year. Six of the eight players on last year’s top-10 team are back on the Gators’ courts this fall, with four of them taking spots in the ITA preseason top-125 rankings.
Senior Nassim Slilam tops those rankings for Florida at 
No. 37 with van Overbeek not far behind in the 58th spot, Wake Forest transfer Frank Carleton at No. 69 and junior Billy Federhofer at No. 119.
All four rankings will matter as the team attempts to 
qualify for competitions like the ITA All-American in Oc-tober, but head coach Andy Jackson is most concerned with seeing his returning talent start a fresh season.
“We need to get matches,” Jackson said. “We could go 
undefeated and have a very poor tournament in my opin-ion, or we could go 50 percent and be OK. That’s what the fall is about, for me to give the feedback to the players on how they’re doing.”
That feedback is key to improving particular elements 
of the game that each player has worked on in practice and during the summer. For van Overbeek, his serve and return will be his biggest focus, while Slilam will be testing out his improved upper-body strength in match situations.
With Jackson comparing USF to a mid-level Southeast-
ern Conference team, and UCF and FAU being “OK,” this weekend will be a solid first test for the team’s skill set as a whole. 
“It won’t be the greatest competition in the world, but 
it will be plenty good enough for us,” Jackson said. “We’re just trying to get going, get matches and get started going for the fall.”UF’s fall season 
begins at home
“The real challenge is to 
try to have that kind of enthu-
siasm all year long for every 
tournament.”

As the Gators head west for 
their second consecutive two-game 
weekend, they are hoping the trip resembles only the second half of their last pair of outings.
No. 9 Florida lost a hard-fought 
match against No. 3 Florida State last Friday, in a game plagued by a sluggish opening 42 minutes on offense. 
The squad was able to ramp up 
its attack for a quick start on Sun-day against Florida Gulf Coast, as UF scored three goals in the first 24 minutes.
With a renewed sense of confi-
dence, Florida (5-2) now travels to the Midwest to take on  Missouri (7-1) tonight in Columbia, Mo., and Kansas (6-2) on Sunday in Lawrence, Kan.  
Gators redshirt junior midfield -
er McKenzie Barney said the team has already put last weekend be-hind it. This week, Barney said UF has worked on imposing its style of play on the opponent.
“Mostly mentality is what we 
are focusing on,” said Barney. “Making sure that we can be that strong Florida team that we know we can, so that means playing sim-ple and smooth offensively and getting after it defensively.”
In order to avoid a slow start 
tonight, Barney said the team has placed a heavy emphasis on its at-tacking flow.
Gators coach Becky Bur-
leigh said the team has also implemented a new drill in practice  to improve the attack. “I just think we need to have a little more consistency in our ability to possess the ball under pressure,” Burleigh said. 
“To that end, we’ll train against 
12 players instead of 11 just to make it harder.  The more pres-sure we can face and be successful against, the better we’ll be when we play in regular games.”
Missouri, winner of seven in a 
row, is a team Burleigh said will be a tough test.
“They are 100 miles per hour,” 
she said. “They are playing at home.  It’s a Friday night. It’s go-ing to be a barnburner.”
Off-day plans: On Saturday, 
the Gators will get to see three for-mer Florida players in action as the U.S. women’s national team takes on Canada in Kansas City.
Heather Mitts (1996-1999) and 
Abby Wambach (1998-2001) will take the field for the U.S. against another former Gator, Melanie Booth (2003-2007).
“The fact that we get to do that 
is amazing,” said UF forward Eri-ka Tymrak.  “Not only do we get to play two games this weekend but we get to see the national team play.  It should be an amazing weekend.” FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 23

After every game, Florida’s 
volleyball team forms a circle and 
stretches. For most players, this is a mindless routine; but for Holly Pole, it often serves as a moment of reflection.
“I just kind of look around, 
and I’m amazed at the fact that this is truly where I ended up,” the freshman defensive specialist said. 
Growing up about 45 minutes 
away in Ocala, Pole watched her brother and sister graduate from Florida and decided it was where she wanted to be, whether it was as a volleyball player or just an-other student majoring in sports management. 
Juggling the idea of being a 
college athlete, Pole looked at other schools and contemplated whether she wanted to play vol-leyball past her time at Vanguard High. Then, UF coach Mary Wise opened a door the 2010 all-state selection had fantasized about.
“When Mary emailed me, it 
was pretty much like a dream,” Pole said. “It was the best of both worlds for me. It was an easy de-cision.”
The offer was to be a preferred 
walk-on, and Pole happily ac-cepted.
“When I first saw her play lo-
cally, I thought ‘She’s a baller,’” Wise said. “She has a toughness about her.”
Her mental and physical 
strength would be tested to no ends during her senior year at Vanguard. 
First, Pole — an International 
Baccalaureate student — decided to graduate high school in Decem-ber to get a jump start on Florida’s other three incoming freshmen.
“Often coaches want people 
to come in early, but a lot of us have a connection to our friends in high school,” junior Tangerine Wiggs said. 
“Holly made a really big deci-
sion with her family.”
But the extra semester of expe-
rience wasn’t quite as beneficial as Pole might have hoped. She missed a large portion of her se-nior season due to a viral infection and then was forced to have knee 
surgery for an injury stemming from her 
junior basketball season.
“It was rough to say the least,” 
Pole said. “The first practice here [in January] was the first physi-cal activity I had done in three months. … It’s not an ideal situ-ation to come into a Division-I school and play volleyball for the first time in months.”
Starting from scratch both in 
the weight room and on the court, Pole was able to merge into Flor -
ida’s system and position herself for a contributing role as a fresh-man. 
Wise  pointed to Pole and fresh-
man defensive specialist Madison Monserez as two players who give Florida the depth it will need as it opens Southeastern Conference play tonight at 8 against Missis-sippi State in Starkville, Miss.
On the court, Pole is one of nine 
Gators to see time in every game this season, and she has contrib-uted five digs in the backcourt. 
“We don’t really consider Hol-
ly a freshman,” Wiggs said. “She has an upperclassman mental-ity.”
That mindset has given Pole 
a unique role among her fellow first-year players.
“She is the mother of the fresh-
man group,” Wise said. “If you see Holly, the other three are not far behind.”3, KICKOFF, ALLIGATOR § FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2011
Freshmen in UF’s regular 
rotation:

The former Ocala Vanguard standout has five digs and an assist. 
§ DS Madison Monserez
Wise has heavily talked up Monserez. She has answered with 19 digs and two assists.
§ OH Noami Santos-Lamb
Having seen action in five games, the Puerto Rican freshman has picked up five kills, one service ace, three digs and three blocks.
§ DS Taylor Unroe
Starting all nine games, Unroe has been a major force in the backcourt this season. She has recorded 122 digs, 23 assists and nine service aces.
