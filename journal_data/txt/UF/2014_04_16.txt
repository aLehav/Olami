� A SINGLE SENATOR OPPOSED THE BUDGETS.
HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org
Two budget bills were approved in Tuesday night’s Sen-
ate meeting, but each was met with only one vote of opposi-
tion.
The approved budgets, one that allocates funds for aca-
demics and another for student organizations, will allocate $423,973 to academics and $998,240 to student organiza-
tions.
Although eight senators spoke during the pro rounds of 
each budget, only one senator, Michael Christ, spoke during 
the con portion of each budget. The debate proved combat-ive, and Senate President Dylan Fisher had to redirect sena-
tors’ comments three times. 
Christ’s main concern was money being allocated to only 
a “select powerful few in Student Government” and that 
three organizations are receiving nearly one-third of the or-ganization budget.
“Student Government is too big — I think we are con-
stantly raising fees … and taking money from students’ pockets,” he said. “When large sums of money are directed toward few organizations, we need to be aware of it, and we 
need to be concerned with it. Tonight we are allocating $1.4 
million. That’s a huge responsibility.” 
Davis Bean, chairman of the budget committee, said 
three organizations receiving a large portion of the fund-ing — Volunteers for International Student Affairs, Hispanic 
Student Association and Asian American Student Union — 
have about 41 organizations underneath them.
“These sub-organizations hold their own independent Student Senate 
OKs allocation of $1.4 million to organizations

� BEWARE OF STANDING WATER.

Mosquito season is here earlier than 
usual, and the Alachua County Health De-
partment is gearing up to prevent the rise of a mosquito infestation.
Last year, the department saw its ﬁ  rst 
reported case of the mosquito-borne West 
Nile virus that environmental health direc-tor Anthony Dennis could remember. And 
this year it is hoping to prevent another case of the virus.“Because we had a wet winter and now 
a wet spring, we’re expecting it to be a wet summer, and that’s going to breed more mosquitoes,” Dennis said.
The department stresses the importance 
of drying out items that collect water, in-cluding tarps, ﬂ  ower pots and tires, he said. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in water, 
and it only takes a few days for larvae to 
grow into adult mosquitoes. 
“Gainesville has a lot of standing water 
at the moment, which is always a concern because it causes adult-biting mosquitoes to be present,” Dennis said.
The department also suggests other tips 
such as using bug spray, wearing protec-tive clothing and repairing window screens to prevent contact with mosquitoes. 
Hilario Cabrera, a 22-year-old UF psy-
chology senior, said he takes precautions whenever summer approaches. He wears 
more bug spray and takes out the trash 
often. 
“I hate mosquitoes, so I try to avoid 
doing things that could make more,” he said.They suck: Florida mosquito season starts earlier than usualRYAN BAUM

Red Bull is bringing a concert to 
Gainesville this week, but due to a 
campus contract snag, it can’t pro-mote the event at UF. 
The Red Bull Sound Select tour 
bus will join electro-pop duo Cher-ub for a free concert Thursday night at The Wooly.
A Red Bull campus spokesman  
said the company originally consid-ered bringing the concert to Flavet Field. It is a company-wide policy for Red Bull employees to be un-named in the media.But Bob Miller, UF’s associate 
vice president of business, said UF’s contract with Pepsi prohibits other brands of drinks from being distrib-uted or promoted on campus. 
“When we have a contract for 
exclusive beverage or food service provider then they get exclusive access to campus,” Miller said. “So 
in the Pepsi contract, only Pepsi 
products can be sold, distributed Red Bull concert stop not on UF campus

Alligator Contributing Writer
Students can stroll through Gaines-
ville’s startup central Thursday night.
The UF Entrepreneurship Club and 
the Center for Entrepreneurship and In-
novation are teaming up to visit about 
30 businesses in a 1.5-mile walk for an 
event dubbed Startup Crawl.
It is a continuation of an event the 
club has been doing for ﬁ  ve years, origi-nally called the Startup Walk, said Ian Mitchell, president of the Entrepreneur-ship Club.
“The purpose of Startup Crawl is so 
that the Gainesville tech community, our 
startups, our campus, our Student Body 
and the community itself all can have an event they can rally around that really gives them a chance to check up on each other,” said the 20-year-old ﬁ  rst-year UF international business graduate student.
Participants will visit major technol-
ogy and startup companies between campus and downtown.
Startup Crawl has tour groups at 4:45, 
5:15 and 5:45 p.m. The times are subject to change depending on the attendance, Mitchell said.
The event is free and open to the 
public, but participants are encouraged to RSVP on the Facebook page because there is a limit of 120 people.
David Nassau, a 19-year-old UF 
marketing sophomore, is involved in both the club and the Center for Entre-preneurship and Innovation. Nassau at-tends Startup Hour monthly and said his favorite thing is the people he meets.
“Gainesville is a cool place, and the 
people are even cooler,” Nassau said. “Especially when you’re in a room with people who had an idea and went for-
ward with it.”Entrepreneurial students

Cat overpopulation is about to paws. 
Local nonproﬁ  t organization Operation 
Catnip is aiming to reduce the number of homeless felines with its free spaying and 
neutering services. Program coordinator 
Erin Mack said it recently received an anony-
mous donation that will pay for 100 feral cats to get spayed or neutered.
“It happened randomly, and we just 
couldn’t believe it,” Mack said. “We’re so 
happy that someone else cares as much about 
the cats as we do.” 
Mack said springtime is an especially im-
portant time to prevent the births of more 
kittens that would otherwise be homeless. 
Cats that have been spayed or neutered can 
be identiﬁ  ed by a cropped left ear.
Operation Catnip holds monthly clinics, 
which provide free spaying, neutering and 
vaccinations for stray and feral cats. The 
organization operates out of the Alachua 
County Humane Society, located at 4205 NW Sixth St., and holds clinics at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine, 2015 SW 16th Ave.“It’s a really great way of reducing the 
population of stray and feral cats and keep-ing them out of the shelter, which keeps them from being killed,” Mack said.
Since July 1998, Operation Catnip has 
helped more than 40,000 cats, she said. It re-lies on the help of donations and volunteers.
Chris Pereira, a 20-year-old UF public re-
lations senior, has two cats: Bentley, 2, and Princeton James, 10 months. He said seeing the stray cats around Gainesville makes him sad, and he wishes he could give all of them a home.
“I love animals, but I was never really a 
cat person until I moved away to college,” Pereira said. “Cats aren’t as affectionate as dogs, but they still give me that animal companionship that I otherwise would not have.”Donor enables 100 cat surgeries

Thursday’s show, which 
will take place in downtown Gainesville, is open to partici-
pants who RSVP on the event 
website at win.gs/flatour. 
Doors will open at 9 p.m. 
Opening acts for this leg of the tour include Carousel and Future Unlimited. 
Unlike Gainesville, the oth-
er three Florida dates in the tour — Tampa, Orlando and 
Tallahassee — will feature 
the custom stage that unfolds from the Red Bull Sound Se-lect tour bus, said the tour bus manager Akoni Kama.
The process of setting the 
stage up and breaking it down is labor-intensive, so the tour bus is generally not used on consecutive days, he said. That’s why it won’t make an appearance in Gainesville.  
The Florida dates are the 
only free shows in Cherub’s nationwide tour. It’s an at-
tempt to connect band mem-
bers with college-age fans at some of the state’s largest uni-versities, according to a Red Bull press release. 
Jason Huber, a member of 
the Cherub duo, said although the Gainesville stop will be different, he is looking for-
ward to it. 
“We’ve never been to 
Gainesville, so we don’t know 
what to expect,” said Huber. “But that’s the best part of this tour, playing in new markets and making new friends.”Gainesville won't

Senators debated food funding, frugality
events and they do their own 
things,” Bean said. “In order to 
keep the system efficient, when 
these organizations have like causes, we group them together 
under someone so they have that 
leadership umbrella up top.”
Carrying over from first read-
ing debates, issues about funding 
for food and fiscal responsibility resurfaced.
Christ reiterated his point that 
he believes organizations can “do more with less.”
“I want to fully fund the stu-
dent orgs so they can be the best 
they possibly can be … but I think they are already overfunded,” he 
said.
Sen. Anthony Sorrentino, who 
spoke in the pro portion of the 
debate, said in comparison to last 
year’s budget, only two organiza-
tions saw increases.
“If there is a fear of the size of 
their budget, it is not apparent in this budget,” he said.
Sen. Joselin Padron-Rasines 
agreed. She said if responsible or-
ganizations were overfunded, they 
wouldn’t need to come back the 
following year requesting more 
money.
“Every year, organizations see 
a need — not a want, but a need — to request more funding because 
they do see that they need to put 
on more events or more money for 
their programming,” she said.senate , from page 1

LAS VEGAS — Federal authorities have 
lodged two criminal charges against a Phoenix 
woman accused of throwing a shoe at Hillary 
Rodham Clinton while she gave a convention speech at a Las Vegas Strip resort.Alison Michelle Ernst, 36, didn't respond to 
a phone message Monday about the charges of trespassing and violence against a person in 
a restricted building, which were filed Sunday 
in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas.
She could face up to a year in federal prison 
on each charge if she's convicted. A court date wasn't immediately set, and it wasn't clear if 
Ernst had a lawyer.
Las Vegas police booked Ernst last week 
on a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge 
and freed her with a June 24 court date. Charg-es haven't been filed in that case.
The federal charges accuse her of bypass-ing security to enter the ballroom where Clin-
ton was speaking and committing a violent 
act by throwing the shoe, which police say she 
pulled from a purse and hurled about 60 feet 
toward the former secretary of state.
Clinton expressed surprise but wasn't 
struck by the shoe. Feds charge woman who threw shoe at speaking Hillary Clinton� SHE WAS FEATURED IN

Mary Lambert serenaded a 
crowd of about 150 Tuesday night 
at The Wooly with a set list rang-ing from love songs to tunes fo-cused on domestic violence. 
Pride Awareness Month hosted 
Lambert and three local artists — Boyfriend Material, Jeff Jones and Zoe Bernardeau — as part of its monthlong series of events focused on LGBTQ  culture. 
Jones wore sunglasses dur-
ing his entire performance and sang a cover of the Lady Gaga song “Dope." Bernardeau sang an original song about her struggle to come out to her grandmother.
Lambert, featured in Macklem-
ore and Ryan Lewis’ song “Same Love,” was paid $4,500 for her per-formance.
Pride Awareness Month inter-
nal director Leah Warwick said Lambert was someone she and many of the organization's mem-
bers loved.
Lambert closed the show with a mix of original songs, spoken word 
and a cover of “Teenage Dirtbag.” 
Katie Gibson, a first-year UF 
physical therapy grad student, said she heard about the perfor-mance from Facebook.

wreath at the site of the first bomb explosion near the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA — A researcher from the Uni-
versity of South Florida said Tuesday that 
a team of forensic experts is using DNA, 
skeletal analysis and digital X-rays to 
identify the remains from a former reform school on the Panhandle.
Erin Kimmerle and Hillsborough Coun-
ty Sheriff David Gee met with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson to share what they have found at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys.
So far, Kimmerle said, DNA has been fully analyzed for 12 sets of remains.
“It’s a very slow process, but it’s thor-
ough,” she said.
USF researchers began excavating the 
graveyard at the now-closed school in Sep-tember. The dig finished in December.
Official records indicated 31 burials at 
the Marianna site, but researchers found 
the remains of 55 people.
Some former students from the 1950s 
and 1960s have accused employees and 
guards at the school of physical and sexual 
abuse, but the Florida Department of Law Enforcement concluded after an investiga-
tion that it couldn’t substantiate or dispute 
the claims.
Kimmerle said it will take months to 
extract and analyze the DNA from the 55 
exhumed bodies.
Kimmerle showed Nelson a comput-
erized image of a young boy — a facial composite of one of the sets of remains excavated from the site. The photo is of an African-American boy, about 10 years old.
“It’s an effort to put a face with the re-
mains,” she said.
All the bodies found were interred in 
coffins either made at the school or bought from manufacturers, Kimmerle said. Some were found under roads or overgrown 
trees, well away from the white, metal 
crosses marking the 31 officially recorded graves.
Kimmerle said that it’s unclear if there 
are other graves elsewhere on the school site. The property is 1,400 acres, and her team has excavated about five acres — al-though she has received tips that graves are located elsewhere on the property.DNA, digital X-rays used to ID school remains near USF

Students surfing the In-
ternet for solutions to health-
related concerns should be 
wary about their search re-
sults.
“The goal really was to just 
find out what’s out there,” 
said Brent Kitchens, the lead 
author of a new UF study on the quality of health-related Internet sources.
Kitchens and the other 
researchers conducted the study by looking at an index of terms that consumers in-terested in health informa-
tion might search. The list is 
from Medline Plus, a website 
provided by the National In-
stitute of Health.
They then typed each of the 
about 2,000 terms into Google 
and looked at the quality of 
the results that came back. They determined the quality of the results by going out to other institutions that evalu-
ate health-care-information 
quality or website quality.
They found that, on aver-
age, more than half of the in-
formation that comes back is 
typically high quality.
“Maybe more interest-
ingly, the quality seems to be different for different types of 
information,” said Kitchens, 
also a doctoral candidate at the UF Warrington College of Business Administration.
Terms that deal with things 
such as cancers, bodily sys-tems, lungs, immune systems and digestive systems came back with higher-than-aver-age quality, while things like 
substance abuse, nutrition, 
wellness, personal health, safety issues, and family and social issues came back with 
lower-quality results.
“That information may be 
interesting and it might get 
you started down the path of 
figuring out something, but 
seeing a physician is prob-ably the best way to go with those types of things,” Kitch-ens said.
Natalie Rella, a specialist 
at GatorWell Health Promo-tion Services, said she agrees with the findings and thinks 
it’s important for students to 
be cautious when searching 
for health-related topics on-
line.
Students have come to her 
with false information they 
found online on topics like 
pregnancy prevention, Rella said.
“I think it’s always won-
derful to have empirical evi-
dence supporting things that 
we may already know anec-dotally, and now we can say a sound study took place that 
can back it up,” Rella said. 
“It’s just another thing for students to take in and con-sider when they are going online to get information at 
their fingertips — to know 
that when they are doing this to use caution.”Stop Googling

Local organic grocers and 
farmers are generally uncon-
cerned by Wal-Mart’s recent partnership with Wild Oats, an organic food brand that will bring 
cheaper products to its shelves.
Lisa McNett, general manager 
of the Citizens Co-op, said she 
doesn’t think the change will af-fect her grocery store’s sales be-cause it doesn’t share a customer base with Wal-Mart.
“Our shoppers understand 
they are paying a little extra for 
a quality local product,” McNett 
said. “They are supporters of the local community and local farm-ers.”
On the other hand, Ward’s Su-
permarket natural foods manager Russ Welker said it may help the industry.
“Having more organic food 
items on the shelves is the best thing we can hope for,” Welker said. “The more good food avail-able to the public, the better.”
He said there isn’t much room 
to cut prices without losing mon-ey because organic food sellers have to stay in the same price 
realm. But a superstore such as 
Wal-Mart, with a broader vari-ety of items for sale than a small organic supermarket, has more leeway.
Marty Mesh, executive direc-
tor of the Florida Organic Grow-ers, said the effect that Wal-Mart’s price cuts will have is yet 
to be determined. 
However, he said he hopes it 
will implement a strategy he calls 
“loss leaders.”
The strategy occurs when a 
store sells one product at a low-er price to increase the amount of customers who come into the store. In Wal-Mart’s case, the lost 
income will be replenished when 
those who typically wouldn’t shop at the superstore purchase other items in addition to organic foods, Mesh said.
Wal-Mart is powerful enough 
to hurt the organic food industry and could drive down growers’ labor and production costs, he said.
“I hope it doesn’t change the 
nature of organic farming,” Mesh 
said. 
But ultimately, Mesh said he 
doesn’t see it as a threat. 
“We see it as an opportunity 
for organic food to become a 
large slice of the food pie for the betterment of both consumers and producers,” he said.Organic produce providers not

daytime naps?Today’s question: Do you pick up your dog’s poop?Energy companies bring ‘crony capitalism’
In the Florida Legislature, the state’s largest energy com-
panies wield extraordinary inﬂ  uence. 
The four largest Florida energy companies — Duke 
Energy, Florida Power & Light, TECO Energy and Gulf Power — employ one lobbyist for every two members of the 
Florida Legislature. These four companies spent more than 
$12 million on lobbying between 2007 and 2013.
Electric utility companies have also spent more than $18 
million on campaign contributions to Florida races since 2004. 
In exchange for their generous campaign contributions 
and lobbying budgets, these massive energy companies re-ceive highly favorable treatment from Florida’s elected of-ﬁ  cials.
In 2006, the legislature allowed Duke Energy to raise 
rates signiﬁ  cantly to pay for a $1.5 billion nuclear power plant. Although Duke recently canceled construction on the plant, the company was allowed to keep all the money from the rate increase, which included more than $150 million in net proﬁ  t.
Furthermore, the legislature continues to allow Duke and 
the other utility companies to collect the increased energy fees without disclosing the status of canceled projects.
A report from Integrity Florida, a political watchdog 
group, found that Duke Energy spent $300,000 on lobbying in favor of the rate increase and another $3.6 million in cam-paign contributions to key lawmakers.
The $4 million Duke Energy spent to ensure favorable 
treatment by the legislature was a mere pittance compared to the massive proﬁ  t it collected from Florida taxpayers.
The energy companies have also used the revolving-door 
strategy of inﬂ  uence, in which former Florida public ofﬁ  cials 
are hired for high-paying positions within the businesses. 
These individuals then return to Tallahassee to lobby their former colleagues to ensure favorable treatment for their new employers.
This system of corruption and greed works very well for 
its main beneﬁ  ciaries: Florida’s elected ofﬁ  cials and the util-ity companies.
Unfortunately, in this broken system of corporate inﬂ  u-ence, Florida taxpayers are forgot-ten, ignored and taken advantage of. 
Stephen Smith, executive di-
rector of the Southern Alliance for 
Clean Energy, said the inﬂ  uence 
of utility companies on the Florida Legislature amounts to “pay-for-play politics that is not in the best interests of consumers.” SACE 
provided a grant that enabled Integrity Florida to publish its report on corporate inﬂ  uence in Florida politics.
According to Integrity Florida’s report, 18 former state of-
ﬁ  cials have current connections to FPL, either as salaried em-
ployees or as lobbyists at ﬁ  rms that represent the company. 
The report also found that ﬁ  ve former members of the Public Service Commission, the state body largely responsible for regulation of utility companies, are also employed by FPL.
The current PSC has never voted against a rate increase 
requested by the four major energy companies and has con-sistently upheld the right of the utilities to collect fees for nuclear plants.
The power and inﬂ  uence of the utility companies on Flor-
ida policymakers is just one example of the “crony capital-ism” that runs rampant in Tallahassee. Pro-gun groups such as the NRA and other special interest groups, including real-estate developers, determine which policies prevail in the legislature and which are defeated.
There are no simple answers to the problem of corporate 
inﬂ  uence on the Florida government. In its report, Integrity Florida suggests demanding increased disclosure of politi-cal contributions and strengthening ethics rules. However, 
these are long-term reforms that become less feasible as the 
legislature grows increasingly corrupt. 
Voting out Gov. Rick Scott, who has acted as a loyal ser-
vant of wealthy and corporate interests, would be an excel-lent start to the process of ending Florida’s system of crony capitalism.

Pick up after your 
dogs, Gainesville
Listen up, Gainesville dog owners: It’s time to cut the s**t. 
The Polar Vortex ended months ago, and Florida is 
back to being a hot, festering swamp. That means when 
you let your dog out and don’t pick up its droppings, the waste sits in the sun and bakes, and the fumes burn off our eyelashes 
whenever we walk by. Seriously, it’s everywhere: A cursory 
newsroom survey revealed that everyone’s apartment com-plexes/houses/lives are littered with dried-up pieces of dog poo. Looking at you, College Manor residents.
We love dogs. And we get it: You’re in college, so you’re 
technically an adult and can, say, impulsively buy a puppy if you want. Or adopt a pit bull from a pet rescue. Or take home a stray cat. 
But if you’re not cleaning up after your pet, you’re not re-
sponsible enough to own one. 
In fact, if you’re not doing something as effortless as putting 
a plastic bag over your hand, picking up a turd and disposing of it, what other pet-owner responsibilities are you shirking?
Blame it on the college-town culture — and Alachua Coun-
ty Animal Services’ so-cute-it-hurts Facebook page advertising adoptable pets. The city launched a campaign in 2009 designed by the Alachua County Environmental Protection Department and funded by the Gainesville Clean Water Partnership. The 
Alachua County Scoop the Poop campaign was a response 
designed to “reduce the fecal coliform levels in Gainesville’s urban creeks.”
The campaign looks as if it really worked, but by now, what 
with student turnover, no one remembers the “Stink Foot” commercial that aired in Gainesville movie theaters before ev-ery show for the majority of July 2009. In addition, organizers hung posters around the city advertising the campaign and partnered with local veterinary practices to spread the mes-
sage. A post-campaign survey proved the campaign was effec-
tive; respondents reported that their habits had changed. 
However, the campaign’s report revealed that when the 
ACEPD reached out to local apartment complexes to take part in the campaign by sending packages with sample posters, bro-chures and information on ordering waste-disposal stations, only 10 of the 258 Gainesville apartment managers responded requesting “Scoop the Poop” promotional materials. 
We realize that simply asking students to quit their s**tty 
behavior (pun 100 percent intended) is basically useless. Col-lege students break unwritten codes of common decency all the time: Girls don’t wipe the toilet seat after squatting, boys arrive in crowded lecture halls post-gym sans-shower and, hello, have you ever been inside Taco Bell after midnight on a Saturday? It’s brutal. 
Instead, we’re calling on the city to revive the “Scoop the 
Poop” campaign, expand it into the Fall and Spring semesters and build strong relationships with apartment complex manag-
ers. With Preview season right around the corner, Gainesville 
should make city beautiﬁ  cation a priority. 
In the meantime, Gators, we reiterate: Scoop it. Bag it. Trash 
it.WEDNESDAY, APRIL 16, 2014

History is full of inﬂ  uen-
tial thinkers, philoso-phers and stoics. These 
men pondered life’s existence, wondered what feats mankind could endure and grasped the ab-stract. They were experts in their 
ﬁ  elds and interested in the world 
around them: They were “Renais-sance men.” Thomas Jefferson, our third president and author of the Declaration of Independence, 
took that term to its rightful ex-
treme. He was an inventor, phi-losopher, writer and politician. He was truly a man of thought 
with an impressive intellect. 
It’s interesting to consider 
how insightful all these men 
were, given their places in time. With relatively limited resources 
at their disposal, they were able 
to conjure philosophies that chal-lenged the status quo back then and continue to challenge our so-
cietal norms today.Fast forward to the present, 
and there is a complete lack of 
this Renaissance mentality. 
This is strange because we 
have more resources and in-formation at our disposal than ever before in the history of the 
world. 
Any one of us could go online 
and read the works of Friedrich 
Nietzsche while listening to a play written by Gore Vidal. But 
none of us actually have a de-
sire to do this, despite having the resources at our ﬁ  ngertips. Have we become jaded by all this 
knowledge, or are we just simply 
uninterested in it? 
If we look at the world around 
us, it’s safe to say we are gener-ally uninterested. 
The Internet, which allows us 
to access powerful resources, is primarily used for stocking pic-tures of friends and uploading cat 
videos. Though debates are often fought in comment sections or 
over Twitter, public discourse is not being advanced through these forums.
The world seems to have lost 
great minds who enjoyed admit-ting their lack of knowledge while keenly bolstering their intellect by becoming more aware of their 
surroundings. We have lost those 
minds that challenge the status quo and authority. Our society is placated by the moment and con-
tent with what we have. 
Despite the impressive pace 
of emerging technologies and 
modern medicine, we arguably live in a — for lack of a better word — dumbed-down society. The productive public discourse 
on our television news stations is 
nonexistent. 
The movies garnering the most 
box-ofﬁ  ce attention are Michael 
Bay ﬁ  lms that overwhelm the 
audience with special effects and are devoid of a well-constructed plot line. 
The politicians we elected to 
solve the gripping problems that plague our nation seem to be ironically and woefully ignorant of the issues they are supposed 
to ﬁ  x. And we must be reminded 
to not put plastic bags over our heads.
It’s dismaying to see such 
group complacency in our ever-
expanding world. 
Even students on college cam-
puses, the traditional birthplace 
of intellectual movements and 
youthful rebellion, are so unin-terested in challenging norms. 
The type of thought that in-
vited tenets to be questioned and beliefs to be dispelled seems lost 
for the moment. In a world full of unanswered questions and monumental problems yet to be 
solved, our lack of interest in 
these conundrums only empow-ers the wrong people with the wrong solutions to solve them. Look at the nation’s capital, and 
you get my drift.  
Just like the Renaissance men 
of the past, we must be attentive 
to the diverse thoughts and opin-
ions around us in order to better 
mankind.  
As the literary innovator Henry 
Miller once said, “To live means to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, 
serenely, divinely aware” — em-
phasis on the “aware.”

Our society needs modern, intelligent Renaissance thinkersColumn
WASHINGTON — Congress has reached a stalemate, the 
effects of which haven’t been felt since the government shutdown in 2013. Apparently, this stalemate was reached 
after Sen. Simpson, D-Ohio, ﬁ  libustered a bill concerning whom to completely screw over next. 
“I really wanted to screw over some war 
veterans,” Simpson said. “I was thinking of doing it slowly by denying them pension privileges.” 
Philosophical objectivist Sen. Flanders, 
R-N.D., struck down the bill, saying that it would practically be giv-ing those dirty, no-good veterans who fought our freedoms what they want.
Some politicians think disguising their desires to completely screw 
constituents as security protocol is the best alternative. Convicted sex offender and Transportation Security Administration agent Moe Lester shares this political viewpoint.
“I love my job. I get to do what I was doing before, except now I 
get paid for it,” Lester said while ﬁ  nishing a cavity search of the ninth randomly selected Arab man who decided to ﬂ  y on that particular day. “And the best part,” he continued, “is that now the people who I do this to pay me to do it to them via taxes.” 
Other congressmen think the most pragmatic way of screwing 
hard-working Americans is by specializing. Since half of the nation is female, some congressmen think trying to screw their speciﬁ  c de-mographic will be easy.
“I’m not a doctor,” one politician said, “but I am qualiﬁ  ed to make 
decisions regarding health because my medical expertise comes from Jesus, who healed the sick and gave the blind sight, making him the best doctor who ever lived. I can consequentially tell women what to 
do and what not to do with their bodies.”
“Politics and I never got along, but I wouldn’t vote for him,” Jesus 
said. 
Some politicians think the best way to screw hard-working Amer-
icans requires a direct approach: screwing them in their mouth. Not 
unlike the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a recent oil spill in Lake Michigan is affecting local residents’ drinking water.
“For the love of God and all things holy, I am so sick,” Detroit 
homeowner Michael Mansberg said while coughing up blood. “I’m not even opposed to Big Oil, but it’s 2014. How did we not force these companies to build their pipelines with basic safety valves to prevent 
this?!”
“Well, that’s easy,” Big Oil  said. “They cost money. They’re cheap 
as dirt, but they cost money. I don’t want to spend money, and Con-
gress isn’t going to say no to me. I’m Big Oil, for Christ’s sake.”

Preston Lewis opened a 
door, and the afternoon sun 
streamed in.
About 13 people formed 
a line in front of Lewis, a 
corps ofﬁ  cer at the Salvation 
Army on University Avenue, a couple streets west of Main Street. 
The agency provides more 
than 1,700 meals each month, said Karen Lewis, Preston Lewis’ wife and co-worker.
Visitors ﬁ  ltered toward 
the plates of lasagna and bread lining a counter. 
The beginning of the 
month is slow, Lewis said, because the homeless get welfare checks on the ﬁ  rst of the month.
Becky and Greg Sylvester 
were there. They are regulars 
and have been together for 
seven years.
“We understand each oth-
er,” said Greg, 41. “We don’t really have all the problems that other people have.” 
The Sylvesters are home-
less. They live alone under a tent in the woods.
People always ask how 
they stay clean, Becky said.
“I do our clothes in a pail bucket,” she said. 
They use another bucket 
for showers.
“She washes. I dry,” he 
said.
“That’s a lot of compat-
ibility,” she said, laughing. 
Staying clean isn’t a prob-
lem, she said, and neither is the lack of shelter. They can handle the rain pouring down on their tarpless tent, 
even when it soaks every-
thing for days.
Their biggest problem is 
prejudice: The Sylvesters are an interracial couple.
When people see the cou-
ple holding hands in public, they call her white trash, she said. At him, they yell racial 
slurs. 
“We have a hard time go-
ing to the shelters,” she said. 
They always get racist 
comments. The passers-by 
they meet on the street ask why they’re together. She said they should mind their own business. 
“God never judged any-
body,” she said.
Her husband said they 
just have to brush it off.
“I think it’s better living 
in the woods,” he said. “You don’t have a lot of racist peo-ple.”
The Sylvesters said their 
love keeps them going. They’ll be together forever, she said.Homeless couple

NEW YORK — A UF law school alumnus was sen-
tenced to life in prison without parole Tuesday for the 
torture and death of his girlfriend, who could be heard begging for her life after her cellphone apparently pock-et-dialed a friend.
Jason Bohn, 35, was convicted of ﬁ  rst-degree murder 
in March for the June 2012 beating and strangulation of Weight Watchers ﬁ  nancial analyst Danielle Thomas, ac-cording to Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown.
The body of Thomas, 27, who also attended UF, was 
found in her bathtub surrounded by ice.
Police also recovered two handwritten notes.One said: “It was an accident ... I was drunk when I 
got home ... I woke up and there was ﬁ  ghting between us ... When I woke up again she was unconscious ... I am sorry.”
The second note read: “Dani, I will 
love you forever” and was signed 
“J.”
The deadly violence erupted after 
Bohn demanded to know why Thom-
as had called a certain area code, tes-
timony showed. 
Their voices could be heard on the 
cellphone recording:
“Danielle, you don’t have a lot of time,” Bohn said, 
and then ignored her as she implored: “Jason, I can’t 
breathe.”
Bohn was arrested and charged with assault and ag-
gravated harassment.UF law grad gets life term for murder

RBIs ON THREE HITS IN WIN.
ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus
The Gators had their work cut 
out for them two weeks ago. An 
eight-game road trip that includ-
ed three top-10 teams awaited 
them. 
They’ve responded and then 
some having defeated Florida 
Gulf Coast (24-14, 9-3 Atlantic 
Sun) 7-1 on Tuesday night to fin-ish its road trip against Kentucky, Florida State, South Carolina and Gulf Coast. 
The No. 9 Gators (24-13, 9-6 
Southeastern Conference) start-ed the trip a game up on the Gamecocks in the SEC Eastern 
Division. They have sole posses-
sion of first place and own the tiebreak against the Gamecocks having won five of their last eight games. 
Florida naturally could have 
bought into the hype with its first top-10 ranking in two years. It didn’t.
“I really like how we’re play-
ing now. Obviously we have a long way to go,” O’Sullivan said. “We’re only halfway through the conference schedule here, but this is an important game. This is one of those trap games.”
Catcher Taylor Gushue drove 
in Richie Martin twice on singles up the middle. Casey Turgeon hit a RBI single through the right 
side to score Buddy Reed. Tur-
geon went 2 for 5 on Tuesday night. The RBI represented the 14th two-out run scored by UF on its eight-game road trip.
Martin drove in Turgeon to 
right field for his third hit against the Eagles and took second on the throw home in the fourth in-
ning. Florida had nine hits by the 
fifth inning with eight coming on singles and the last a double by Reed.
Florida added three more in 
the seventh inning on singles by Braden Mattson and Peter Alonso and a double down the left-field line by reigning SEC Freshman of 
the Week A.J. Puk. 
Every starter besides third 
baseman John Sternagel regis-
tered a hit.
“It’s just like anything else in Florida finishes road trip with victory over Florida Gulf Coast
William A. England/ Alligator Staff
Taylor Gushue bats during Florida’s 3-1 win against FSU on March 18 at McKethan Stadium. Gushue 
drove in Richie Martin twice on singles up the middle in UF’s 7-1 victory Tuesday night against FGCU.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
With just 10 games left in the regu-
lar season, coach Tim Walton wants his 
team to remain composed with postsea-son play around the corner.
Riding a six-game win streak, Walton 
knows his team has the capability to suc-ceed in its final three Southeastern Con-ference series.
“The key for us is being able to stay 
focused on who we’re playing,” he said. “We can beat anybody. We’ve proven that this season. We can beat anybody. But we’ve also proven that we can lose to anybody as well, so I think in prepara-
tion it’s just going to come down to ex-
ecution.”
For the ninth-year coach, the Gators’ 
success begins with their pitchers.
“It starts in the circle for us,” Walton 
said. “If we can pitch well, I think we can beat anybody. We’re a tough team to match up against because of our speed and our power and really the two- or three-headed monster that we can go with in the circle.”
Added senior Hannah Rogers: 
“We’ve all been working hard in the bullpen and coming up here in our off 
days. [We’re] just doing everything that 
we can to get bet-
ter.”
Rogers has 
taken an increased 
workload as of late. In the past 10 games, the Lake Wales native pitched a team-leading 38 innings. The rest of Florida’s pitchers threw just 27 frames during that 
same span.
Rogers has a team-best 1.81 ERA — 
the fourth-best mark in the SEC. Her five 
shutouts in 2014 bring the right-hander to 34 in her career, four shy of tying Stephanie Brombacher for the second-most in UF history.

Prior to Friday night, Corey Brewer had  
never scored more than 29 points in an NBA 
game. During his three-year tenure at Flori-da under Billy Donovan, Brewer topped out at 26 points.
So when the Minnesota Timberwolves 
forward exploded for 51 points in a 112-110 victory over the Houston Rockets on Friday, he even managed to surprise himself.
”I’m not even going to lie,” Brewer said, 
according to the Associated Press. “‘Fifty?!?’ … You know how many guys scored 50 in the NBA? That’s what makes it such a spe-cial night because I never in my career ex-pected to score 50. 
“There’s a lot of good company up 
there.”
Brewer’s 51-point breakout performance 
tied teammate Kevin Love for a franchise record, which was set in a 149-140 over-time loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on March 23, 2012.
Not only did the 6-foot-9 forward lead 
his team to victory Friday, but Brewer also 
showed off his defensive skills by tying a 
season-high six steals.
Since steals became an official statistic in 
1973-74, only Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Rick Barry and Brewer have recorded at least 50 points and six steals in a single game. But no 50-point performance was more unex-pected than Brewer’s on Friday night.
“I thought I was in high school again,” 
Brewer said in the Timberwolves’ locker room following the game. “Everything was going in, but I was just playing. I wasn’t thinking about it until someone was like, ‘You got 44, you can get 50 tonight.’ I was like, ‘Oh, yeah OK, whatever.’ Then I actu-ally got 50.”
On the Rockets’ side of the game, Chan-
dler Parsons, who came to Florida when 
Brewer left for the NBA in 2007, finished the 
contest with 27 points on 11-of-19 shooting. 
Beal leading Wizards down home 
stretch: On April 2 against the Boston Celt-
ics, Bradley Beal missed just one shot and scored 19 to help the Washington Wizards clinch their first playoff berth since 2008.

Timberwolves forward� MARTIN SERVED AS TENNESSEE’S 
COACH FOR THREE SEASONS.

The Cuonzo Martin Experiment at Ten-
nessee is over.
After three years as the Volunteers’ 
coach, Martin bolted from Knoxville, 
Tenn., on Tuesday and agreed to a ﬁ  ve-year contract to become California’s next coach. He will replace Mike Montgomery, 
who retired in late March after coaching 
the Golden Bears for six years.
Martin is fresh off a run to the Sweet 16 
at Tennessee, during which his team, as a No. 11 seed, knocked off 11-seed Iowa 78-
65 in overtime in a play-in game, 6-seed 
UMass 86-67 and 14-seed Mercer 83-63 be-fore falling to 2-seed Michigan 73-71. 
Each season while at UT, his team’s record improved. In 2013-14, the Volun-teers ﬁ  nished with a 11-7 league record — fourth in the Southeastern Conference. 
Martin, who previously coached at Mis-
souri State before taking over for Bruce Pearl, went 63-41 at Tennessee in three seasons. 
The move from Knoxville to Berkeley, 
Calif., afﬁ  rms speculation that Martin disliked how Tennessee’s athletic depart-ment and its fanbase treated him. Earlier in the season, Vols fans started an online 
petition to ﬁ  re Martin and re-hire Pearl, 
who is now at Auburn. 
Some of Martin’s former players ex-
pressed that sentiment via Twitter.
“Can’t treat people any kind of way 
and expect good in return,” Jordan McRae (@JordyMac52) posted.

In Bryan Shelton’s ﬁ  rst year as 
Florida’s coach last season, the 
Gators failed to advance to the 
Southeastern Conference Tour-
nament championship match.
After opening the tournament 
with a 4-0 win over South Caro-
lina, No. 3 seed UF fell to No. 2 
seed Tennessee 4-2 in the confer-ence semiﬁ  nals on April 20, 2013.
But with SEC Tournament ac-
tion approaching Friday in Nash-
ville, Tenn., No. 4 seed Florida 
hopes to beneﬁ  t from last year’s experience and advance further than last season.
The Gators have not won the 
SEC Tournament since 2011, when former coach Andy Jackson was at the helm. 
In 2012, the team fell in the 
conference quarterﬁ  nals to Ole Miss in a 4-1 upset. 
Florida hopes to buck that 
trend this weekend. Shelton will 
look to seniors Mike Alford and Florent Diep to lead the way, but 
he also expects his younger play-ers to carry some of the weight in 
the postseason as they have been 
doing in the regular season.
Shelton was pleased with the 
play of Alford and Diep this past weekend in a loss to Vanderbilt 
and a win against Kentucky. 
“They came out and played 
extremely well,” Shelton said. 
“They came out and got the job 
done for us; not only in doubles, 
but in singles. It’s been fun to see those guys in leadership roles for our team to come through in big moments for us, especially in the 
SEC.”
He also praised others like 
No. 92 Elliott Orkin and Maxx 
Lipman, two freshmen who have 
played with poise recently. 
“Our freshman continue to 
do well. We’re asking a lot of 
them every week,” Shelton said. “They’re really having to step 
up here in their ﬁ  rst year for the 
Gators.”
Teamwork between the young-
er and older players is also evi-dent in the rankings, with Orkin and sophomore Gordon Watson 
being ranked No. 19 in doubles 
as well as senior Diep and sopho-more Watson ranking No. 29. After it leaves for Nashville on 
Wednesday, Florida will beneﬁ  t 
from its bye and have a chance 
to see its upcoming opponent in action. Friday, the Gators will take on 
the winner of the match between 
No. 5 seed Mississippi State and 
either No. 12 seed Arkansas or 13-seed LSU in the quarterﬁ  nals.14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 16, 2014

Former Tennessee men’s basketball coach Cuonzo Martin (right) smiles as he is 
introduced as Cal’s new coach at a press conference Tuesday in Berkeley, Calif.
Vols coach accepts Cal jobthis game. You kind of go 
through spurts where you’re seeing the ball good as a 
group and there are spurts 
where you’re not seeing the ball good,” O’Sullivan said. “I think the road trip 
has helped. Hopefully it has 
brought our team closer to-gether.”
Right-hander Ryan Harris 
threw two scoreless innings 
in his first appearance of two 
or more innings since March 21. O’Sullivan wanted Harris to throw about 30 pitches in 
his first career start. 
Left-hander Kirby Snead 
followed Harris with his 
usual effective work, get-ting five-straight groundouts 
from the third to fifth in-
nings. 
He retired 12 of his 13 bat-
ters at Hammond Stadium. Snead has not allowed a run in all but four of his 18 ap-pearances. 
“Kirby Snead was out-
standing. He threw four in-nings. I don’t even think he threw 40 pitches,” O’Sullivan said. “He’s going to be ready 
for this weekend.”
Gulf Coast scored its only 
run on a seventh-inning double over the head of cen-terfielder Harrison Bader 
by Michael Suchy off right-hander Justin Shafer. 
The right-hander pitched 
two innings in relief before freshman Shaun Anderson finished the Eagles off in the ninth. Florida outhit Gulf Coast 15-4 and took advan-
tage of three Gulf Coast er-
rors.
Florida, named No. 1 in 
RPI on Tuesday, is 12-6 this 
season against the NCAA’s 
top-25 RPI teams and 8-1 against South Carolina, Flor-ida State and LSU. 
The Gators avenged a loss 
to Gulf Coast on Feb. 27 and clinched the three-game sea-son series.
Georgia visits Gainesville 
for a three-game series start-ing Friday night at 7:30, which also begins an eight-game home stand.
“It’s tough to go in the 
venues we played at,” O’Sullivan said. 
“We went up to Florida 
State and played in that envi-
ronment. I think it was a sell-
out. We go to South Carolina and obviously we had three sellouts there. We had to bond together as a group.”
A UF radio broadcast con-
tributed to this report.were in the postseason, Beal was 
just 14 years old and still three years away from stepping foot on Florida’s campus. But now as 
the NBA season comes to a close, 
Washington is in position to po-tentially lock up a No. 6 seed be-hind Beal’s play on the court.
During the Wizards’ three-
game win streak, the former one-and-done Gators guard has av-eraged 17 points and 3.7 assists per contest. With just one game 
remaining on the regular-season 
schedule, Beal can help lock up his team’s playoff position when Washington faces Boston tonight at 8.
In the most recent game for 
Beal and the Wizards, the 6-foot-5 guard scored 15 points and re-corded five assists in a 114-93 win 
Monday over the Miami Heat, 
which rested LeBron James and Chris Bosh. 
The victory not only ensured 
Washington would have a one-game lead over the Charlotte Bobcats heading into the regular-season finale, but it also knocked Miami out of the race for the No. 
1 seed.
The highlight of the game came 
when Wizards guard Andre Mill-
er grabbed a rebound off a Heat missed field goal and chucked it the full length of the court to find an open Beal, who finished the play with a layup despite being fouled.
“It was a post route,” Beal said. 
“The safety bit on a ball fake, so I was able to beat the corner and I got free for a touchdown. Hope-fully, the Redskins will pick me up.”WEDNESDAY, APRIL 16, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Rogers elevating game 
defensively for Gators
staff, Rogers has taken on more of 
a leadership role as the season pro-gresses.
“She’s really done a good job 
of communicating with them and 
teaching them the way and having 
one-on-one conversations about her early success and her early failures and things they need to work on,” Walton said. “But a lot of times she does this just by doing it and not necessarily having to say a lot.”
Rogers has also shown improve-
ment with her play on defense in her 
final year at UF. Her fielding per-
centage is at a career-high .977, and she helped turn three of Florida’s 15 double plays this season.
“Most people don’t realize how 
important her defense is to an in-field,” Walton said. “But when she can make plays that our shortstop can’t, it really helps not only the 
speed of the game, but getting out of 
innings when the other team looks like it’s going to potentially rally.”
Even though Rogers has taken 
the brunt of the work with the sea-son drawing to a close, Walton said the rest of his pitching staff also needs to finish the season strong, especially since each pitcher makes different contributions to the team.
Freshman Delanie Gourley paces 
the Gators with 113 strikeouts — the third-highest total among freshmen in the SEC — and has 12 wins under her belt.
Junior Lauren Haeger, despite 
being limited to just 62.2 innings on the season and 10 frames in the past 10 games, is holding opponents to a .159 clip at the plate and has 50 
strikeouts.
In her one-inning appearance 
against North Carolina State on 
Saturday, the Peoria, Ariz., native needed just 16 pitches to retire three batters, fanning two batters in the process.
“One thing you notice is how 
hard (Haeger) was throwing the 
ball,” Walton said. “You know, 
Hannah’s really stepped up and has carried the majority of the innings here as of late, which can be great. She’s fresh. She can take the bulk of the load, but we need all our pitch-ers. … We need to work hard and continue to be tough for other teams to prepare for us, and Lauren is a 
key component to our team.”SOFT , from page 13

Every race is unique. 
Different swimmers, different 
times, different distances and dif-ferent strokes in different pools, but there is one constant. Before 
they hit the water, before they step 
on the blocks and before some even get to the pool deck, all of the Gators go through the same steps to get ready.
Pre-race routines are religious 
for some swimmers, and they can start as soon as they wake up on the day of a meet.
Some are less serious. Florida 
sophomore Ryan Rosenbaum needs two things: coffee and a good pair of socks.
Race day starts with a morning 
swim, usually three hours before the meet, he said, followed by a coffee with cream and sugar that he and a small group of swimmers have before every meet. 
“There’s a nice little group of 
coffee-addicted people on the team,” Rosenbaum said. “The whole crew will just go to Dunkin’ right before the meet.”
But the Fort Lauderdale na-
tive makes it as much of a point to have on a nice pair of socks as he gets his coffee ﬁ  x on race day, and not just any socks will do. 
His most notable pair is blue 
with the red and yellow Super-man “S” emblem on the front and a red cape in the back. 
You read that right. Socks with 
capes.
Then it’s the hype music, a sta-
ple in the diet of pre-race pump-ups for athletes across nearly every sport. Some like to keep it serene and calm their minds, but Rosenbaum prefers something a bit more aggressive when he’s gearing up in the locker room.
“Just really, really mean rap,” 
he said.
This year his go-to jam is 
“Shabba” by A$AP Ferg. It’s grit-ty, tough and gets him ready to go. It’s even penetrated the minds of the swimmers around him in practice. 
“During normal sets, you’ll 
just be thinking of the Shabba,” he said.
He is not the only one who likes 
to have fun before the meets.
Senior Elizabeth Beisel rou-
tinely jokes around with her team-mates to keep her mind off of the race at hand. She said she listens to her iPod depending on her mood to amp herself up, ranging from electric dance music to rap if she’s feeling hardcore.
But her ultimate preparation is 
her conﬁ  dence. 
It’s like a switch ﬂ  ips and the 
energetic jokester who bounces around the pool deck — spread-ing her boisterous laughter — be-comes the two-time USA Olym-pian and All-American who was the face of the Gators women’s 
swimming and diving team dur-
ing her tenure at Florida, which ended last month at the NCAA Championships. 
Her intensity is palpable as she 
glares at her opponents in neigh-boring lanes, shaking out her arms and legs, loosening her muscles, completely conﬁ  dent.
“Everybody likes knowing that 
they’re going to win going into a race, but that’s never a given,” Beisel said. “But the more you can convince yourself that you’re go-ing to win, the higher chance that you’re going to have to win. That’s when I do my best. When I’m re-ally nervous and I don’t feel conﬁ  -
dent that’s when it’s not good.”
It’s a similar process for junior 
Dan Wallace. 
His preparation starts days 
before a meet in order to keep 
his mind off of swimming and on staying relaxed — almost as if the looming competition wasn’t coming at all. He likes to be with 
friends and go about his daily life, 
attending class and practice while enjoying the weather when the sun is out. 
“Just go day by day and just 
act like it’s no big deal,” Wallace said.
And that even keel carries over 
to the meet as well.
Breakfast and warm-ups are 
the common routine. There isn’t anything speciﬁ  c, just fuel for the day. He laughs with his teammates to keep himself from focusing too much on his upcoming events, but when he’s staring down the lane, he knows the time for relaxation is over.“I get behind the blocks and I 
know it’s go time,” Wallace said.
School is a good distraction for 
senior Marcin Cieslak, who also likes to keep himself distant from 
a meet in the days leading up to 
it. In his native country of Poland, there is no collegiate athletic track for swimmers to take, so the dis-tractions that he values are less present.
“I like being relaxed the days 
out because then you can put more focus and you have more 
energy,” Cieslak said. “It doesn’t 
wear off.”
His attitude doesn’t change for 
bigger meets. The consistency is part of what allows him to con-tinually perform at a high level — like winning NCAA titles in the 200 IM and 100 ﬂ  y, which he did at the national championships in 
March.
The morning of a meet, the 
2012 Polish Olympian uses a cold 
shower to wake himself up and start harnessing that energy he reserves for days. Stepping on the deck is a whole other sensation.
“The second I show up to the 
pool I can smell the racing,” he 
said. “My heart starts to beat fast-
er.”
And the signature “ﬁ  st of pow-
er” cheer of the Florida swimming and diving team is his ﬁ  nal pump-up. 
Now, he’s ready to race.As all four swimmers step up, 
eagerly waiting to hear “swim-
mers, take your mark,” there is one 
thing they all share in common. 
The thoughts racing through 
their heads when they are perched on the starting blocks, ready to ex-plode into the water — absolutely nothing. Their minds go blank.
The time for thinking is over. All the practice, the prepara-
tion, the psych-up music, the cheers and even the socks culmi-nate in the moment just before the horn sounds and the body takes over as they plunge into the wa-ter. 
Their routines are different, but 
the goal is always the same: Swim fast.
