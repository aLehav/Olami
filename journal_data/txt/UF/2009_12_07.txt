Common concert draws 5K
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Hip-hop fans were willing to get soaked
Friday night in order to see Kid Cudi and
Common perform at the Flavet Field Band-
shell.
The concert, which was put on by Student
Government Productions, attracted a crowd
of about 5,000 who stopped by throughout
the cold, rainy night.
Aaron Crespin, chairman of SGP Music
and Entertainment, said SGP brought the mu-
sicians to UF for a total cost of $75,000.
Crespin said SGP anticipated a crowd of
about 10,000 to 15,000 people. Although he
knew students would be out of town due to
the Southeastern Conference Championship
game, he attributed the lower turnout to the
weather.

Shay-J and Boy Wonder.
When Kid Cudi appeared, the stage lights
flashed red and white as he
asked the audience if there
was a big game coming up.
Kid Cudi's performance
included his hit "Day 'N'
Nite" and other songs such
as "Man on the Moon" and
"Soundtrack 2 my Life."
Common Kid Cudi danced back
and forth across the stage,
moving in time to the music.
He encouraged the audience to join in and
dance along.

UF dining center evacuated after fire alarm
Racquet Club Dining Center diners evacu-
ated Friday after a fire alarm went off.
The alarm, which sounded shortly after 1:30
p.m., caused a small disturbance as customers
of Moe's Southwestern Grill and Chili's Too
quickly filed outside. The Student Recreation
and Fitness Center was also evacuated.
Tonya Curry, a Moe's employee who was
working during the alarm, said everyone inside
remained calm as the alarm went off, and some
customers even tried to continue ordering.

ATLANTA -When the group
of reporters around David Nel-
son dispersed, and the Florida
players had mostly cleared out of
the locker room, the senior wide
receiver said what everyone was
thinking.
"What now?" Nelson said, half
to himself and half to a team assis-
tant before making his way to the
Georgia Dome's showers.
Nelson and the rest of the No.
5 Gators (12-1) got the answer to
that question Sunday night when
it was announced that they are set
to take on No. 3 Cincinnati (12-0)
in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's
Day.
"We have the winningest class
in the history of the Southeastern
Conference, and our legacy is go-
ing to be determined by how we
finish this season," UF coach Ur-
ban Meyer said.

Gainesville Fire Rescue Lt. Mike Cowart
said the alarm went off after a heat detector

problem, which added to the alarm.
A burnt hamburger was also found, likely
left on the grill during the evacuation.
The detector was reset and building main-

The hamburger's condition has not yet
been released.

As UA quarterback Greg McEl-

Like much of the college foot-

they were happy to finally see a

The 32-13 win against the

Rescue finds families for pets
By ROBERT HILSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
With soggy weather all around, no TV to watch
football on and no late-week finals to wait out,
Chyanne gathered her belongings and went home
earlier than most in Gainesville.
"Going home" is a new concept for Chyanne,
who's been without one all her life, but packing
wasn't terribly challenging. She travels only with
a stainless-steel drinking bowl and a piece of
crusted rawhide.
On Saturday and Sunday, Maddie's Pet Res-
cue Project found a family for Chyanne, a red and
white Australian cattle dog, and several dozen
other animals during the organization's Home for
the Holidays Adopt-a-thon.
The biannual event offers orphaned pets to lo-
cal residents on the Oaks Mall south lawn.
"You can judge a community by how it treats
its animals," said Kirk Eppenstein, executive direc-
tor of the Alachua County Humane Society, "and
Gainesville is a compassionate community."
Adopters exchanged a background-combing,
three-page application and a small fee for a new
family member courtesy of the ACHS and four
other partners of Maddie's.
Though most of the future pets cost $35 to $100,
Brandon Ibarra and Dexter White split a $125
charge from Town & Country Veterinarians to
adopt a beagle puppy for a mutual friend.
"I'd hate to name it and have it stick," said Ibar-
ra, a 20-year-old UF student who got the Christ-
mas gift on a whim. "But I know she'll love it. She
really wants one for her own."
About 1,000 people attended the event Sun-day. The puppies went fast on Saturday as almost
1,000 people had circled their straw-filled pens by
2 p.m., but Jaymi Short, for one, focused on the
older dogs.
Short, 17, a volunteer for Puppy Hill Farm Ani-
mal Rescue, trolled around with Tamariah, 4, a
horse-like Great Dane who was discarded from a
moving car as a puppy.
"These aren't Christmas gifts," said Short, who
owns two boxers, Selina and Sergeant. "They're
perfect for anytime. They're going to be your best
friends."
"You can judge a community by how
it treats its animals.
Kirk Eppenstein
executive director of the Alachua County Hu-
mane Society
According to Michelle Texier, 25, a vet techni-
cian with Town & Country, the full-grown ani-
mals are the ones most at risk among Gainesville's
overpopulation of strays.
"Puppies and kittens are adorable; they're
bought on a whim," Texier said, adding that she
wouldn't trade her 4-year-old mutt, Nalani, for
anything.
The shared commitment of people like Texier
has translated into a more than yearlong stretch,
during which no healthy animal has been eutha-
nized, said Eppenstein.
"Shelter animals know the situation they're in,"
said Jessica Peet, 28, the membership coordinator
at ACHS. "They're more grateful. I really believe
that."Shands decks the halls

The holidays bring to mind
towns frosted in snow, mugs of
steaming cocoa, warm sugar cook-
ies and toasty fires.
But for some children, the holi-
days mean white-walled hospital
rooms, shrill beeping machines and
IVbags filled with fluids that slowly
drip into their bodies.
Shands Children's Hospital at
UF usually has about 50 patients
over the holidays despite efforts to
get them home, said guest services
specialist Ginny Profumo.
But Shands'staff and Gainesville
residents have ensured that the
young patients' time in the hospital
will be much merrier.
Decorations, presents and cards
bearing tidings of a speedy recov-
ery flood in each holiday season.
"We try to make the best of the
bad situation," she said. "They're
missing out on the holiday cheer at
home with their own family."
Last week, Profumo turned the
pediatric floor into a winter won-
derland, with glittering snowflakes
hanging from the ceiling.
"It's the staff that does every-thing with their own time and mon-
ey," she said. "It's so beautiful."
The hospital does not have
much storage space, so Profumo
keeps most of the decorations in her
garage until the week after Thanks-
giving, when they deck the hospi-
tal's halls.
A group of UF medical students
sing carols, and a doctor and his
wife dress up as Santa and Mrs.
Claus and bring gifts."It's just like a labor of love," she
said. "People love toLocal do it."News Nurses sort
through the dona-
tions and choose the right gifts for
each patient, she said, so that each
child wakes up with a perfect gift
on Christmas morning.
UF student group Friends for
Life of America set up a table on
Turlington Plaza last week to add to
the holiday cheer, making cards for
pediatric cancer patients.
The holiday reminder brightens
the patients' stay, Profumo said.
"I think it really helps their emo-
tional well-being," she said, "be-
cause even if they don't feel good,
there are good things going on
around them."

Wives were able to drag their husbands away from the
television for at least a few hours this weekend.
An estimated 15,000 people took a break from football to
peruse the more than 200 booths at Craft Festival 2009 in the
Stephen C. O'Connell Center on Saturday and Sunday.
Christmas music played in the background while 258
crafters sold handmade goods ranging from Christmas or-
naments and magnetic picture frames to gourmet dog treats
and painted piggy banks.
Buyers packed both levels of the O'Connell Center and
stopped to chat with vendors.
Renee Musson, the festival's co-coordinator, said this was
the 17th year the festival was held in the O'Connell Center.
She said it has been held on campus for more than 50 years.
Musson said it is held every year around the same time to
give people an opportunity to do some Christmas shopping.
"We were looking to find really quality gifts for people
in Gainesville that they wouldn't be able to find anywhere
else," Musson said.
Attendee Chris Schreiber said she liked the friendly atmo-
sphere of the festival.
"It's quite enjoyable just to walk around," she said. "I can
make two or three loops [around the festival] and never see
the same thing twice."
Heather Price, who sold handmade baby bibs and burp
cloths in the show, said this was her first year participating.
"I had a friend and I gave her some of my stuff as a gift
and she suggested I come here because she comes here every
year and loves it," Price said.
Price said a number of people stopped to browse the pas-
tel-colored bags and blankets at her "Simply Baby" booth.
She said she was impressed with the number of different
types of crafts for sale.
"From what I've seen, it's quite a mix," Price said.

Common dedicated song to 'all the ladies'
UF to offer
CPR session
U COURSE WILL BE HELD WEDNESDAY.
By ASHLEY HORN
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF's CPR & Safety Training Center is offering an
instructional session on CPR to cap off the end of
fall semester.
CPR Anytime, a non-certifying, 22-minute in-
structional session on how to perform infant, child
and adult CPR and choking relief, will be held
Wednesday and includes a free lunch. The class is
held in association with UF s College of Medicine.
The cost of the course is $10, and registration is
open until 15 minutes before the course begins at
noon in 266 Yon Hall inside Ben Hill Griffin Sta-
dium.
Less than 5 percent of cardiac arrest victims sur-
vive because most at the scene do not know CPR,
according to the College of Medicine Web site.
"With the skills that they learn through the
course, I believe that participants will be able to in-
crease the chances of survival for someone who is
in cardiac arrest," said Victor Martinez, the training
center's marketing and community outreach coor-
dinator.
The center also sells CPR kits that include a per-
sonal CPR mannequin, practice DVD and booklet.
The adult and child kits are $30; Infant kits are $35.CONCERT, from page 1

He said he likes how Kid Cudi talks about feelings that
people don't normally want to talk about, like many young
people's uncertainty about their future.
"I feel like he talks about, yeah, the feelings that people
hide," Milone said.
Common finished up the concert with a 45-minute per-
formance that kept the crowd pumped.
He encouraged people in the audience to wave their cell
phones as he sang "The Light," dedicating the song to the
deceased hip-hop artist J Dilla and "all the ladies" in the
audience.

nity together, even in tough economic

Last Wednesday, an informational
pep rally was held at Grace at Fort
Clarke, a Methodist church, for all vol-
unteers. The show's executive produc-
er, Conrad Ricketts, explained what was
happening with the project in terms of
schedules and different tasks for those
involved.
Strickland said that because so many
organizations around Gainesville had
already signed up as partners for the
project through material and monetary
donations, the pep rally was a way to
bring everyone together.
Linda Michalisin, vice presidentof public relations for Frankel Media
Group, said the advertising agency
found out about the project coming to
Gainesville in the middle of November.
H ",
A"It's a wonder-
ful opportunity for
our community, es-
pecially around this
time of year, to help
a deservingneighbor
in need," Michalisin
said.
"Everyone in the
Gainesville com-
munity has wanted to be a part of this
exciting event since this city was first
chosen," she added. "College students,
families and high school students are
coming together to make this a reality."
Five families were narrowed downby community nomination in August
when the show had a casting call in
Gainesville.
Today at 10 a.m., one family will be
chosen by ABC and updated on arkex-
tremebuild.com.
One of the most important criteria
ABC uses in determining which fam-
ily will be chosen is choosing one who
gives back to its own community, re-
gardless of its struggles.
The family will be sent on vaca-
tion for one week while the project is
completed, which takes more than 100
hours, she said.
Supplies are still needed, includ-
ing scissors, brooms and masking tape.

Confederate plate no
debate for stateAsit turns out, the longest battle of the Civil War was not
Gettysburg, or Maretta, or Yorktown.
For years, the Sons of Confederate Veterans has been
fighting for a specialty license plate to celebrate "Confederate
heritage."
The group has met the state's requirements for issuing a new
plate. It has collected $60,000 in application fees and designed a
marketing strategy. It has even found more than 30,000 good ol'
Floridians who intend to buy the plate.
The Florida Legislature has understandably fought to pre-
vent it from becoming a reality. But last week, a federal judge
in Orlando ruled in favor of the group, ordering the state to de-
fend the constitutionality of its refusal.
We think there is no need for such a plate. Those who would
buy it already drive jacked-up pickups, with mud tires and at
least one giant Confederate flag blowing in the wind at all times.
They get their point across just fine.
But if they want to go muddin' in style, with not one, not
two, but three Confederate flags on their license plates (yes,
that's the design), we say: Let 'em.
It is not the state's place to restrict any one group from ex-
pressing its message. If Florida rejects this plate on the grounds
that it's offensive, we will have to reject any plates that may be
offensive -and that's a prettybroad term. (How about "Choose
life" -we're offended by that one).
Vanity plates aren't the state's endorsement of an idea, but
rather a reflection of what Florida residents want and think.
And if more than 30,000 Floridians want to perpetuate years
of racism, bigotry and backward thought under the guise of cel-
ebrating "heritage," the state can't simply prevent them from
doing so.
At least we'll have one more sure sign of whom to avoid on
the road (and whom to key in the parking lot).
'Mock' Trial
Italy's courts threw thebook at American college
student Amanda Knox on
Saturday, sentencing her to 26
years in prison for murdering
her British roommate.
The yearlong trial was rife
with problems for the prose-
cution, including the fact that
somehow the metaphorical
book throwing found its way
into the interrogation room.
But this time, picture a phone
book -a favorite interroga-
tion tool of brutish police.
While a confession wasn't
quite beat out of Knox, she
claims that at one point inter-
rogators hit her in the head for
not remembering the facts.
The defense also asserts she
was pressured into confess-
ing, though investigators told
her to "imagine what would
have happened," and that her
lawyer wasn't present.
The confession was thrown
out, not that it mattered in the
minds of the jurors.The other evidence re-
mains questionable at best.
The knife she allegedly
used to commit the crime
doesn't match the wounds,
and DNA on the blade was
too small to be definitive, says
the defense. DNA on a bra
clasp, footprints in blood and
a broken window make up
the other shaky evidence that
numerous expert witnesses
have disputed.
The other key point of any
trial -motive -was never
clearly established by the
prosecution, which changed
its theory multiple times
throughout the trial.
If the glove doesn't fit, Ita-
ly will apparently send you to
jail until it does.
Americans take for grant-
ed the rights our justice sys-
tem provides defendants. But
abroad, the game changes,
and sometimes results in the
mockery that is the Amanda
Knox trial.

Personally, I think
an FSU license
ill'$, plate is more
repulsive than a
Confederate plate.
The state should ban those, too!
Column
2009: Year of distractions, scandals
009 hasn't left us yet, but it's not too soon to look back
on the last of what Time Magazine recently dubbed
"The Decade from Hell."
This year, in the age of Twitter, Facebook, CNN's I-Re-
port, and the complete ballooning of the blogosphere, it's
now safe to call 2009 the Year of Distractions.
From Michael Jackson to Tiger Woods, we have been
non compos mentis. In other words, we've acted like total
nincompoops, blindly worshipping whatever offers us the
first refuge from serious discussion and examinations of se-
rious problems.
Today we pine for the times when a D-list star was con-
sidered someone whose fame lasted for 15 minutes. No one
occupies the national mindset for only 15 minutes anymore.
The Balloon Boy, who entered our country's consciousness
at the height of a critical Washington showdown on univer-
sal health care, is still in the news, long after his father's 15
minutes of fame were up.
When drastic economic measures were taken to save our
and the world's economy from total destruction, we started
to have a meaningful national discussion on the flaws of
our economic structure -and then Michael Jackson died.
Coverage of MJ's death lasted for 15 weeks. But at least
he was a true celebrity, someone who almost deserved the
amount of media attention that even a Pope's passing can't
bring.
What, then, is our excuse for giving ABC's "Good Morn-
ing America" a pass on offering Levi Johnston, father of
Bristol Palin's child, seat time on their cozy couches? There
Johnston sat one early October morning, rehashing the hor-
rors of living with Sarah Palin, as if somehow more than
half of America needed convincing that Palin was just a
political phantasm who had more in common with Carrie
Prejean than any serious vice president prospect.What's Johnston's claim to fame?
He forgot that condoms had been in-
vented.
Meanwhile, back in the real
world, a critical debate was taking
place inside and outside the White
Matthew Christ House over the merits of sending
etters@alligator org additional troops to Afghanistan.
Right as the debate got good, two
low-class-faux-reality television stars crashed a high-class
White House state dinner.
Instead of depriving the now-notorious Salahis of the
cheap fame they wanted, we put them on the "Today
Show."
The year of the Balloon Boy proved that it's good we
have a representative democracy, because only our elected
leaders are capable of staying on topic.
Wrong. Even President Barack Obama went off message
just weeks into his presidency to offer a "teachable mo-
ment" on race relations when he answered a question about
the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. What
was the result of this teachable moment? A beer summit at
the White House.
After announcing his new strategy for Afghanistan last
Tuesday, Obama was probably thankful for the distraction
Tiger Woods' sexual escapades in his Escalade provided
him. After all, no amount of rhetoric could explain away
why 30,000 additional troops are needed to root out al-
Qaida there, when his own National Security Adviser, Gen.
James Jones, told CNN that "fewer than a hundred" oper-
ate out of the country.
Then again, what was I talking about?

Letters to the Editor
Reader fails to detect sarcasm
Thank you, Mr. Maple, for bringing Tiger
Woods' affair to light for everyone who had
unfortunately missed out on the "media sleaze
machine" coverage. I'd have to say that yours
was by far worse. Not only did you cite the
same news sources you bashed, but you also
managed to do so in a way far more offensive
than the mainstream media. You refuted the
media's attack on Woods' affair with a cocktail
waitress by saying his actions were only really
wrong because he didn't choose the right type
of woman to sleep with.
If you have a hot Swedish wife, maybe you
would want more (after all, a man has needs).
But you certainly couldn't get that from some
other tool's sloppy seconds. Once you're a
sports star who has been with a model, you
can't degrade yourself by being with anything
less ever again, right? Well, maybe from your
patriarchal point of view where women are
merely objects to be had. And to think you
were attempting to tell us about the crap the
major news sources try to push.

Humor column lacks humor
I would like to express my disgust at Erik
Voss' Avenue column, "Killing Christmas
spirit." Not only was it lacking humor, but it
was simply revolting. If the Alligator must re-
sort to publishing stories about the intentional
public embarrassment of another human be-
ing for its "humor" column, it needs a new
comedian.
Regardless of whether the story he told was
fact or fiction, it was completely distasteful. If
Voss is worried about having to "dig Santa's
grave" and about destroying the "holiday
spirit," he might try not acting like a jerk. Voss
is the one who should be ashamed of his re-
pulsive behavior, not the poor woman trying
to show Christmas spirit.
Mr. Voss: If you are going to be a jerk, fine,but keep your non-comical stories to yourself.

Pedestrians must look out for cyclists
It's about that time for another complaint
from the beleaguered Gainesville cyclist. I
come to you with scabby palms and bruised
shins. The cause of my pain? This time around,
an innocent pedestrian crossing the street.
Yesterday, while hustling down the side-
walk on West University Avenue, I attempted
to zip to the right of a pedestrian. Vision ob-
scured by her monstrosity of an umbrella, she
stepped into my path and, unable to avoid her,
we collided, sending my beloved Schwinn and
I tumbling into the street.
I was ready to rain my wrath on this girl;
months of antipathybuilt from cycling through
campus threatened to explode. The maelstrom
was quickly diffused by the apologetic cries
of none other than a favored classmate. To as-
suage her guilt, I spoke nothing of my hurts
and only replied "these things happen."
And these things do happen all the time
on campus. It's not the first time I've run into
somebody, and it won't be the last. Pedestrians
walk around campus with impunity. They jay-
walk with the assurance that the 20 mph traffic
must surely stop for them. Laden with Krishna
lunch and a cell phone tucked between their
cheeks and shoulders, they cross the bike lanes
without ever thinking of looking left and right.
Their mothers would be ashamed.
The fact of the matter is, the same way bi-
cycles are forced to share road space with cars,
we are forced to share sidewalk space with pe-
destrians on campus. Pedestrians don't have
turn signals or brake lights. If they want to
race over and hug their big sisters, they do so.
If they need to send a text, it's going to hap-
pen right then and there. What pedestrians do
have are top-of-the-line, built-in brakes and
the ability to turn on a dime and turn one's
head to look behind.Cyclists sacrifice this maneuverability for
speed. We can't always avoid you and your
hulking backpack, so please work with us. If
you have to send that text right now, step off
the path and let traffic by. Hug the side of the
path and leave us room instead of walking
abreast with your pals. It's as simple as being
spatially aware and walking decisively.
Don't make me yell, "Watch where you're
going, asshole!" It only generates unnecessary
hostility, and you were so kind to lend me
your archaeology notes last week.

Graduate students deserve pay increase
I am writing today to voice my opposition
to the creation of any fee for the restoration or
expansion of the Reitz Union.
Fees have already risen astronomically in
the past few years, while our paychecks have
not done so. This, coupled with the crippled
economy, has left most graduate students in
a precarious situation. Graduate students are
already burdened by fees that amount to more
than $1,000 a year, roughly 10 to 20 percent of
most of our paychecks for the entire year.
We feel that our shouts to get increases in
pay have fallen on deaf ears. (Funny how the
administration often has money to give the
professors raises or to hire new professors but
consistently has no money to pay graduate
students an increase.) But the whispers com-
ing from the Student Senate, which passed the
resolution supporting this pay increase, are
being heard. This is wholly unacceptable, es-
pecially given the fact that most of the students
who voiced opinions at this Senate meeting
opposed the fee increase. The Senate wouldn't
even allow for a referendum to see if the Stu-
dent Body supported paying to renovate and
expand the Reitz Union.
The Reitz Union is not in critical need of
repair and expansion. What is critical is that
the administration do its best to support itsgraduate students, especially because we are
the ones who do the majority of the teaching
and research at the university.

Reader thanks columnist for writings
Joe Dellosa,
After reading your column, "Say what you
would regret leaving unsaid," it was obvious
that the only option for me was to write this
e-mail.
I have read most of your articles, and I have
been wanting to e-mail you and let you know
how much I enjoy them, but for some reason I
would always put it off. However, after read-
ing this article I knew that one of the things
I would regret is not letting you know how
much your articles have affected me.
The article "People in relationships
shouldn't settle" published on Oct. 27 has con-
tinuously had me thinking. A few months ago,
my boyfriend and I broke up. Being back on
the market has not been the easiest. Not be-
cause no one is interested, but rather because
no one is interesting.
Although it is nice to go out to eat or to
watch a movie with someone, your article has
made me question whether I am settling with
this person. Also, your article has made me re-
alize that if I am settling, I am being unfair to
both him and myself.
Your article has reminded me that if I feel
bad for refusing to go to breakfast with him
or not picking up some guys phone call, I
shouldn't because I am doing us both a favor,
and not wasting our time. I am single now,
and I know I will be single until I find some-
one with whom I am extremely happy.
So Joe, I just wanted to say thank you for
writing the way you do and the things you do.
I enjoy your thoughts and appreciate your col-
umns. Write on!

UF tops FIU, will face No. Penn St. next
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
For the last week, the Gators
have had to hold it in.
But it didn't take long for
them to finally let it out.
"Right now, it's all about
Penn State," senior Elyse Cu-
sack said after Florida's sec-
ond-round match.
No. 14 UF (25-5) did its part
in advancing to the inevitable
Sweet 16 matchup against the
No. 1 Nittany Lions (34-0) with
a sweep of shorthanded FIU
3-0 (25-22, 25-15, 25-16) in the
O'Connell Center on Friday.
Penn State also swept its
way through the first two
rounds to punch its ticket to
a date with UF on Friday at 6
p.m.
The Gators clinched their
spot in the showdown in large
part because of their 12 blocks.
They racked up 11 more than
FIU (32-4), which is the largest
blocking margin of the season
for UF.
"We know that the teams
that have had any success
against FIU blocked balls,"
coach Mary Wise said. "When
we didn't block balls early on,
we were a little concerned."
After recording only two
blocks in the first set, the
Gators exploded with 10 in the
final two sets.
Sophomore middle blocker
Cassandra Anderson led the
effort with four and a half
blocks along with nine kills.Four UF players, includ-
ing Anderson, finished with at
least one block.
"The longer the match went
on, we adjusted more," Ander-
son said. "We saw where they
were hitting, and the more the
match went on that just helped
us figure out where we needed
to put the block."
"We knew coming in
against FlU with their
feisty little setter, that
they play with such
emotion, and we had to
match that."
Elyse Cusack
UF senior libero
In UF's first-round match,
Wise said her team did not
play with enough intensity,
but that wasn't a problem Fri-
day.
"We knew coming in
against FIU with their feisty
little setter, that they play with
such emotion, and we had to
match that," Cusack said. "If
we didn't and we played flat,
they were going to take advan-
tage of it."
An emotional 7-0 run by
the Gators to grab the second
set along with an injury that
kept FIU's best hitter, senior
Yarimar Rosa, out for the third
frame broke the back of the
Golden Panthers.

UF FOOTBALL
Gators can't stop Ingram, Tide offense
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@a Iligator org
ATLANTA -Florida came into the
Southeastern Conference Championship
Game with the No. 1 scoring defense in the
nation, but the Gators hadn't played Mark
Ingram yet.
Alabama's Heisman Trophy candidate
running back broke tackle after tackle on
his way to 113 rushing yards and 76 receiv-
ing yards, helping the Crimson Tide put 32
points on the board.
UF came in allowing 9.8 points per game,
one rushing touchdown in the last six games
and only three all season.
Ingram rushed for three in 47 minutes."One of the worst games we've played
around here in a long time," UF defensive
coordinator Charlie Strong said. "We just
didn't tackle. There were a lot of three-step
(drops), so we just didn't
tackle well. It's no differ-
ent from what we played
all season, we just didn't
make plays."- The missed tackles
gave Alabama the chance
to make big plays without
Ingram throwing the ball down-
field.
Ingram took a screen pass 69 yards at
the end of the second quarter, setting up his
3-yard rushing touchdown. And wide re-
ceiver Marquis Maze took a 5-yard hitch 34yards on a third and 3 on the previous drive
to set up a Leigh Tiffin field goal.
UF cornerback Janoris Jenkins came up
to make the tackle but was quickly turned
away by Maze, who finished the game with
five catches for 96 yards.
"Your ability to tackle -that's your job,"
safeties coach Chuck Heater said. "So if you
don't do it, you're going to have a hard time
getting off the field."
Though the Gators couldn't seem to tack-
le Ingram, the Crimson Tide's success was
also a result of a surprise effort.
Ingram, whose 1,429 rushing yards
ranked him seventh in the nation coming
into the game, didn't go overlooked by Flori-
da's defense, but Alabama quarterback Greg

avid Nelson didn't want to
leave the field.
He had just let Florida's
final, last-grasp chance at pulling out
a miracle victory slip through his fin-
gers.
Hope had become slimmer and
slimmer as time wasted away, and
while the game clock read 7:28, this
was the end.

pkegler@alligator org He would
eventuallymake
it off with some
consolation from Tim Tebow, who
had just thrown the pass that Nelson
dropped on fourth and 3 from the
Alabama 13-yard line.
Florida's offense would not take
the field again.
"That's it," Nelson said. "We've
worked for the past year for this mo-
ment, and everything we've done, ev-
erything we've trained for, everything
we've worked for the past year since
the Oklahoma game last year was for
this moment, and it's over. We didn't
take care of business."
There probably couldn't have been
a more shocking finish to the Gators'
22-game winning streak and their
quest for a historic third national title
in four years.
This is what the view from the oth-
er side looks like, Florida fans.
Remember when Florida celebrat-
ed a 41-14 win over Ohio State in the
2007 BCS National Championship
Game?
The total domination the Gators
exhibited over the Buckeyes came
to mind as eerily similar to the way
the Crimson Tide did whatever they
wanted in the Southeastern Confer-
ence Championship Game. The rea-
sons were different -UF was simply
more athletic than OSU -but have

Gators find stroke, rout Dolphins
* UF WENT 12 OF 20 FROM
BEYOND THE ARC.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
JACKSONVILLE -So far this
season, the Gators have built their
identity on defense, a sharp con-
trast to the team that lived and died
by its 3-point shooting a year ago.
Friday night, Florida looked a
little more like its old self.
No. 13 UF shot 12 of 20 from be-
yond the arc on its way to an 85-67
win at Jacksonville (0-5), moving to
8-0 for just the third time in school
history.
"I feel like in the previous
games, we've had bad shooting
nights and good defense," said
freshman guard Kenny Boynton,
who returned to the starting lineup
and scored 15 points. "In this game,
we had a good shooting night and
bad defense.
"We've just got to put it all to-
gether."
The Gators entered Jacksonville
Veterans Memorial Arena shoot-
ing just 27.7 percent from 3-point
range, but Boynton, Erving Walker,
Dan Werner and Chandler Parsons
kept shooting with confidence like
UF coach Billy Donovan told them
to, and the shots finally started fall-ing.
Florida's eight second-half 3s
were more than the team has made
in all but one game this season.
"Teams were not even playing
us honest sometimes. Me and KB
had a lot of good looks this game
and the last few games," said Walk-
er, who led the team with 18 points
on 4-of-5 shooting from beyond the
arc. "It seems like it's slowly start-
ing to change, and we're happy for
that."
The Gators
and Dolphins
traded baskets
for the openingMen's 13 minutes of the
Basketball game, and UF
held just a 31-29
lead with 7:13 remaining in the first
half.
The fast-paced first half was
starting to wear on a UF team play-
ing its eighth game in 17 days, but
the Gators clamped down on de-
fense and only allowed one JU field
goal from that point on -a layup
by guard Ben Smith as the buzzer
sounded.
"We've had an emotional, long
stretch here. It's been a long stretch
for our kids, and our kids have
done a good job," Donovan said. "I
knew there was going to be a lot of
emotion and energy.
"We looked a little drained and a
little fatigued, but we hung in thereand did the things necessary to find
a way to win the game."
With Jacksonville refusing to be
put away for most of the second
half, Florida's defense once again
buckled down. The Gators gave up
just seven points in the final 8:43
and held the Dolphins scoreless for
more than five minutes to end the
game.
"It's good to see us hitting shots,
but we definitely didn't play de-
fense the way we wanted to," said
Werner, who finished with 13
points. "They were flying the ball
up and down the court. Our pres-
sure really wasn't as effective. They
did a great job handling it.
"The last couple minutes of the
first half and the last couple min-
utes of the second half really won
us the game."
With the Gators' outside shoot-
ers hitting from long range, Vernon
Macklin put together one of his best
scoring games as a Gator.
The junior center hit all six of his
free throws -extending his streak
to 12 straight and giving Donovan
another reason to play him late in
the game -and finished with 16
points on 5-of-7 shooting.
"(The improved outside shoot-
ing) makes it a lot easier," Macklin
said. "I want these guys to keep
this up and keep on knocking them
down and help out a lot of our big
guys."PHIL, from page 13
bad with a team that was sup-
posed to be so good?
Remember when UF would
not be denied in a 31-20 win
over Alabama in last year's
SEC title game?
The Gators outscored the
Tide 14-0 in the fourth quarter
of the 2008 affair. Tebow deliv-
ered a big-time performance on
a national stage and seemed to
will his team to victory.
The senior quarterback de-
livered a similar pep talk to his
teammates before Saturday's
fourth quarter.
Nothing changed.
By the time it was over, the
2008 SEC champion Florida
team outgained the 2009 run-
ner-up Florida by 23 yards in-
side the Georgia Dome, but UF
lost the time of possession bat-
tle Saturday by a whopping 19
minutes, likely due to an aban-
donment of the run game.
Offensive coordinator Steve
Addazio, who regrettably was
unavailable for comment after-
ward, called a game in which
his two star running backs
combined for three carries.
And while the offense con-
tinued to struggle in the redzone (zero touchdowns in
three trips compared to four in
six trips in '08), there is nothing
more puzzling than the defense
allowing 490 yards.
But this one wasn't one
player, one coach or even one
unit's fault.
Alabama was just better in
every facet of the game, and
that was the biggest surprise
of all.
"They came out and played
tremendous," Nelson said.
"They came out and played like
a national champion should
play. And we didn't."
When Tebow announced
that he would return for his
senior season, he told fans he
wanted to do it all again.
For 12 weeks, the 2009 UF
football team seemed to be
a team of destiny. It looked
poised to put the final seal
on Tebow's promise with a
defense that sought its place
among the greats in history.
At the end of the day, the
ending to the script was very
simple, very cut and dry.
The greatest era in Florida
football history came to a stum-
bling end Saturday, and no one
really knew why.
That is life on the other side
of the coin.

UF looks to fix running game
FOOTBALL, from page 1
multiple occasions throughout the
regular season, but the defense
never let the team down before
Saturday.
Alabama controlled the ball
for 39:37 of the game's 60 minutes
and converted 11 of its 15 third
downs, including 8 of 9 in the sec-
ond half.
"They ran the same stuff we
saw on film, they just ran it a little
bit harder," UF cornerback Joe
Haden said.
The offense was unable to step
up and save the day as the defense
faltered, partially because a frus-
trated Tebow and the rest of the
unit couldn't seem to stay on the
field.
The Gators averaged 236 rush-
ing yards and 451 total yards per
game coming into the rematch
with Alabama. But they could only
manage 88 rushing yards and 335
total yards of offense against the
nation's No. 2 defense.
"Obviously our rushing, we
didn't get the backs -Tim ran
the ball for some yards -but we
didn't get our backs going," Mey-
er said. "But it seemed like we
were behind, and we were trying
to play catch-up the entire night,
and we didn't do that."
UF was content to abandon the
run early despite never trailing
by more than nine points in the
first half. Offensive coordinator
Steve Addazio's unit ran the ball
nine times and passed it 17 times
before the break, with only three
of those carries going to players
other than Tebow.
The balance, or lack thereof,
only got worse in the second half,
as the Gators finished with 14
rushes and 35 passes, with four
carries going to players other than
Tebow.
Addazio has said many times
this season that Florida is a rush-
ing team, only to abandon that
identity in the biggest game of theseason.
"If you try to be something
you're not, sometimes that fails,"
Addazio said after UF played
Vanderbilt.
The Gators will have to figure
out some way to get back to the
running game that made them
so successful if they hope not to
suffer a similar fate against the
Bearcats.
"I don't think you can win the
game without getting the running
backs involved, so that's a high
priority for us," Meyer said in the
Sugar Bowl teleconference Sun-
day night.
"This is not how we wanted
to finish our season in the
SEC, and, you know, there
were a lot of goals and a
lot of goals we won't be
able to accomplish. We've
still got to regroup and go
have a good bowl game,
and that's what our focus
will be."
Tim Tebow
UF senior quarterback
Motivation will be another is-
sue for a Florida team that had
hopes of winning its third nation-
al championship in four seasons.
Last year, the Crimson Tide suf-
fered their first loss of the season
to the Gators in the SEC Champi-
onship Game and were unable to
regroup before dropping a second
game to Utah in the Sugar Bowl.
UF will lean on its decorated
senior class to avoid a similar
fate.
"This is not how we wanted to
finish our season in the SEC, and,
you know, there were a lot of goals
and a lot of goals we won't be
able to accomplish," Tebow said.
"We've still got to regroup and
go have a good bowl game, and
that's what our focus will be."MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 15

SWAMP STUDS
It was hard to find standout performances in a loss as dismal
as this one, but Tebow did about as good as he could after
Florida apparently decided to abandon the running game (four
non-Tebow rushes). His 310 total yards were the fourth-most
he has had all season, and when he led that four-play, 70-yard
Tim Tebow drive in the second quarter, UF fans probably got some hope.
Unfortunately, no Tebow pep talks could rile the defense outQB, Sr. of its slumber, and the senior's interception in the end zone
sealed the Gators' fate.
20-of-35 passing, 247 yds, TD, INT; 10 rush, 63
yds
The fact that a punter is our No. 2 Swamp Stud pretty much
sums up Florida's terrible day in its biggest game of the year.
Henry has been one asset the Gators have been able to count
on all year, and the junior set an SEC Championship Game
record by averaging 48.8 yards on his four punts, eclipsing his
mark of 47.7 from a year ago. Matching your season high of Chas Henry
four punts in a game where your defense can't get a stop is a P, Jr.
recipe for disaster, but Henry did all he could do to swing the
field position game in UF's favor.

WR, R-Sr.It wouldn't be a championship game if Tebow didn't connect
with Nelson, who caught only his second touchdown pass
of the season in the second quarter. The redshirt senior's
seventh career touchdown turned out to be the Gators' only
trip to the end zone in nine offensive possessions. Nelson
was understandably down after the game, but he had his best
performance of the season and had the second-most catches
Saturday.

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Florida hopes team meeting leads to improved play
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alligator org
With nearly a week off to re-
flect on its latest loss, UF is ready
to get back out on the court and
under the lights.
Those bulbs won't be brighter
than on tonight's national stage
when Florida plays Rutgers (5-4)
at 7 in Piscataway, N.J., in a game
being televised on ESPN2.
Coming off a compressed
week that saw Florida play four
games in an eight-day span, UF
has had the luxury of a near-full
week of practice.
"The good thing about this
week was we just got to focus
on us and Rutgers," guard Jor-dan Jones said. "There were no
other factors coming into play or
any other games we had to worry
about."
That week also provided the
Gators (3-4) some time to digest
their poor start to the season.
"There hasn't been one game
this year that we executed out-
side, inside, just all aspects of
what we're capable of," Jones
said.
Following UF's fourth loss of
the season on Tuesday, Florida
had a team meeting where team-
mates held nothing back, calling
each other out and getting every-
thing out into the open.
Azania Stewart, who scored
a career-high 17 points againstFAMU on Tuesday, said she took
away from that game a need for
accountability.
"We're 3-4, and that's not a
good look right now," Stewart
said.
She said she
has been sur-
prised by the
team's inconsis-
tency this sea-
son, pointing
out shades of
potential in the
opening 12-0 run against FAMU
and the 11-0 run in the closing 48
seconds of that same contest. The
pair of runs wasn't enough.
"If we can do that for the first
four minutes, why can't we keepit consistent throughout? That's
what really this week has been
about," Stewart said.
With more free time this
week, there has been more atten-
tion paid to the Scarlet Knights,
and the Gators will have to play
lockdown defense against a team
that's full of one-on-one offen-
sive threats that can penetrate at
any time.
UF will likely counter with
depth -boasting a larger roster
than Rutgers' 10-woman squad
-and help defense.
If there has been one surpris-
ing problem for the Gators this
season, it hasn't necessarily been
the defense as much as their in-
consistent shooting.Splitting its last four games,
Florida has shot a combined 50.8
percent from the field in the two
wins while shooting a pedestrian
34.6 field-goal percentage in the
two losses.
That has meant more reliance
on the post game as a means of
generating offense.
"It's kind of been a deflat-
ing thing when we're out there
and we have a wide-open shot
and the shots just aren't falling,"
Jones said.
"It's definitely a game, espe-
cially being on national TV, that
we want to show what team we
really can be and not the team
we've been these past couple of
games."
Cusack four digs shy of SEC mark
VOLLEY, from page 13
Rosa attempted to play despite the
injury but could not finish the match.
The senior was in tears for much of the
final set as an injured left shin kept her
on the sideline.
"No matter how much you tell the
team that they can do it, they know
what she means to the team," FIU
coach Danijela Tomic said. "Seeing her
on the bench crying is not easy to over-
come."Wise knew the Gators' win must be
put in perspective.
"I know deep down there is an aster-
isk, and that is Rosa,"
-0 Wise said. "If she is 100
percent healthy, she is
one of the most dy-
Volleyba11 namic outside hitters."
But in the end UF
won its 25th match
of the year for an NCAA-best 19th
straight season. Cusack finished just
four digs short of becoming the SEC's
all-time career digs leader.UF surprised by McElroy's execution
DEFENSE, from page 13
McElroy seemed to sneak up on the Gators.
He completed 12 of 18 passes for 239
yards and dropped in a touch pass to tight
end Colin Peek from 17 yards out to cap
the Crimson Tide's first drive of the second
half.
The junior looked poised in the pocketand found the open man consistently with
Alabama's offensive line keeping Florida's
pass rush at a distance.
Without suspended defensive end Car-
los Dunlap, the Gators sacked McElroy one
time -on a safety blitz by Ahmad Black.
"The guy that we didn't think could ex-
ecute as well as he executed was the quarter-
back," Heater said.
