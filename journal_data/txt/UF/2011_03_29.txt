RONKONKOMA, N.Y. — A New York 
raccoon found itself in a sticky situation over 
the weekend.
For eight hours on Sunday, the scaven-
ger sat with its head inside a peanut butter jar while perched atop a Long Island utility pole.
The unusual sight brought out dozens of 
curious residents on a Ronkonkoma street. Children quickly nicknamed him Skippy.
Newsday says Debbie Sullivan spotted the raccoon outside her house at 7 a.m. She called Suffolk police, the town of Islip and the state Department of Environmental Con-servation. They all said little could be done.
The raccoon’s ordeal finally ended 
around 3 p.m. when a crew from the Long Island Power Authority came to its rescue. The jar fell off as they used a pole to grab the animal.
Skippy quickly scampered off.

Timothy Berryhill was no stranger to 
earthquakes. 
The U.S. Navy pilot and UF graduate had 
been previously stationed in Okinawa, Japan, 
where he sat through plenty of small shakes and tremors.
But earlier this month, when the rocking 
in the 35-year-old’s base room in Atsugi per -
sisted past the short seconds he was used to, he knew something was out of whack. 
“It was disorienting,” said Berryhill, who 
graduated in December with a master’s de-gree in chemical engineering. “It took me 20 seconds to realize, ‘OK, this is a lot worse than the tremors I’ve experienced before.’”Berryhill attempted to get out of his room, 
where he was completing some work on his computer. The shaking was so bad he almost fell down. He made it to a nearby stairwell, where he clung onto the railing for safety. 
Then, just like that, it was over. 
After the shaking on March 11 subsided, 
he ventured to a fellow crew member’s room 
to figure out what exactly was going on.

When the whip cracks, they know they’re 
in the presence of the Lord.
A group of boys spitting chew around a 
fence post glances over.
In a nearby field, 9-year-old Hunter Holmes 
and 6-year-old Emory Weins, both in match-
ing plaid shirts and cowboy hats, break from herding fellow elementary schoolers and perk up their ears.
Older folks, still finishing their dinner of 
pulled pork and baked beans, put down their forks and make their way to the pavilion.
Hats fly off heads as the Rev. Billy Keith be-
gins the prayer offerings.
Instead of pews, the congregation sits on 
picnic benches. For an offering basket, they use a 10-gallon hat. Rather than a choir, Christian country singer Hunter Erwin sings “I Found Jesus at a Walmart.”
This is cowboy church.In a rodeo arena just off S.R. 41 in Williston, 
the rugged and the denim-decked have met every Thursday at 7 p.m. for five years to hear 
sermons from Keith.
He’s a burly man with a thick goatee and an 
even thicker Southern accent. His work-hard-
ened hands wrap all the way around yours as he greets you with, “How y’all doin’?”

Against many citizens’ wishes, 
Paynes Prairie will no longer have liv-
ing, breeding herds of bison and horses.
About half of Paynes Prairie Preserve 
State Park’s bison, and possibly its hors-
es, will be removed from the park next 
winter.
The final plan for removing the ani-
mals was released by the Florida De-partment of Environmental Protection last week, about six months after the plan was announced.
In previous interviews, department 
staff said the animals will be removed due to concerns of inbreeding and wor -
ries that the animals will escape into residential ar -
eas.
The final plan differs 
slightly from the draft 
plan, which went up against public scru-
tiny in a citizen meeting on Nov. 30.
The plan recommends removing all 
male bison from the herd of about 60 bi-Bison removal finalized

Connecting our donors to our patientsn DUE TO THE DEFICIT, THE STATE 
CANNOT MATCH DONATIONS TO HELP PAY FOR CONSTRUCTION.
  By HANNAH WINSTON
 Alligator Writer
  
 For the third year in a row, $130 million 
in donations for UF won’t be matched by the 
state, and an estimated state deﬁ  cit of more than $3 billion looms as the culprit. 
  The construction of 15 buildings, includ-
ing a Chemical Engineering Building and Graduate Studies building, would have been paid for by the Alec P . Courtelis University Facility Enhancement Challenge Grant Pro-gram. In the program, $29.4 million from university donors would have been matched by the state for a total of nearly $58.8 million.
  Leslie Bram, associate vice president of the 
University of Florida Foundation, a nonproﬁ  t 
organization that invests and raises money 
for UF, said all the proposed new buildings are necessary and highly anticipated. 
  “Our donors and benefactors are frustrat-
ed because they want to see the projects come through,” she said.
  She said while the university does not have the money now, it remains committed 
to the projects. 
  “We’ve delayed three years and construc-
tion costs have gone up,” she said.
  Some buildings were given the go-ahead 
when the university took out loans and 
thought the money would come through.
  Construction on Hough Hall ﬁ  nished last 
fall and the Harn Museum of Art’s Cofrin Asian Art Wing is expected to be completed 
next spring. The university is still waiting for 
state funding to pay off loans. 
  The Major Gifts Trust Fund Matching 
Grant Program would have matched more than $101 million in donations that could have gone to a number of projects at UF, ac-cording to Janine Sikes, spokeswoman for the university.
  “We understand that budgets are tight at 
this point,” she said.   UF buildings lack funding

 The New York Times began charg-
ing users to view online content Mon-
day.
  The Times print edition is current-
ly available for free on campus, and 
there are already plans to extend the 
college readership program to digital 
subscriptions, according to an email from Eileen Murphy, vice president of corporate communications for The Times.
  Readers who do not digitally sub-
scribe will still be able to access ar-ticles a number of ways that don’t count toward the new 20 articles per month limit.
  If a reader is linked to an ar-
ticle through a social media web-site, the view does not count toward the monthly limit, according to The 
Times.   Similar rules are in place for search 
engines like Google, but there will be 
a daily limit imposed on articles found through certain major search engines. 
  The new digital subscriptions are 
available in three different packages, which range from $15 per month to 
$35 per month.
  Readers who already subscribe to 
the home delivery edition will also 
have unlimited on-
line access, which 
they can register for 
online.
  UF professor Mindy McAdams 
said she thinks the fair conditions of 
the article limits for non-subscribers 
will help keep the readership from 
dramatically decreasing.
  Murphy said libraries will eventu-
ally be covered under group accounts, 
which they are working to make avail-
able in the next several months.  NYT still free on campus

It almost seemed like we were watching a movie. It was 
humbling watching the cars and the buildings being taken by 
the force of the water.” 
Within the hour, Berryhill called his wife, Katie McGoogan, 
and sent a mass email to friends to let them know he was OK. 
McGoogan, an employee at Shands, said her husband called 
her just before she had time to panic, as she woke up to the news on the radio with her 7 a.m. alarm. 
In a span of a couple days after the disaster struck, Berry-
hill’s Navy squadron, along with other squadrons from Penn-sylvania, began mission work to help those in need. 
That Friday , Berryhill went on a mission to distribute 21,000 
pounds of food to the survivors, which they dropped off at an-
other air base to be trucked down to the disaster areas. 
In the Navy’s missions, supplies ranging from seismology 
gear to toilet paper to blankets were delivered. 
However, Rod Turbak, Berryhill’s commanding officer, said 
that Japan’s government never formally asked for the help. 
“Everybody wants to reach out and lend a helping hand,” 
he said. “People donated things. They piled up quite fast.“
Part of the cargo delivered by the Navy was from donations. 
The rest were from supplies that were on hand. 
While flying on the relief missions, Berryhill and his crew 
were given radiation detectors to determine their nuclear con-
tamination resulting from the destruction. 
Based on the readings, the crew hadn’t been contaminated. Now he’s back in Gainesville with his wife and 14-month-
old child. But Berryhill, who had lived in Japan for three years, said he still carries a personal attachment to the area. 
“I hold a special place in my heart for the Japanese people,” 
he said. “This is a huge tragedy. It was an honor to serve and 
assist our friends in time of need.”  4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, MARCH 29, 2011

While many people are still on 
the job hunt in Gainesville, some 
of their fellow unemployed peers 
have landed paid positions that 
have contributed to a nearly one-point drop in the area’s unemploy-ment rate in February. 
According to data released by 
the state this week, Alachua Coun-
ty’s unemployment rate dipped 
to 7.7 percent in February, an im-provement from the 8.6 percent figure in January 
In January, 11,234 people in the 
area were unemployed out of a la-bor force of 130,932. In February, that number dropped to 10,137 unemployed people out of a labor force of 131,083 people. 
The Gainesville area, which 
is comprised of Alachua and Gil-christ counties, boasted the lowest unemployment rate of 23 Florida metro areas with a 7.8 percent rate 
for February, according to the state 
report. 
Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe 
posted on his Twitter: “February unemployment numbers show that #Gainesville is moving forward!”
His sentiment was echoed by 
Susan Bottcher, a candidate for the District 3 City Commission seat in Gainesville.
She said the improved un-
employment rate showed how 
Gainesville is gradually becoming 
a more business-friendly area. 
“Gainesville is overcoming and 
surpassing the old idea that we’re 
not a business-friendly commu -
nity,” Bottcher said. “I think we 
have to keep our eye on the ball and continue to make sure our lo-cal government works with local 
businesses.”
Bottcher’s opponent in the April 
12 run-off election for District 3, 
Rob Zeller, said many Gainesville residents still face the harsh reality of being unable to feed their fami-lies each day. 
With so many people still un-
employed, Zeller said there is much work to be done to improve 
the area’s private sector to ensure 
they would be able to find jobs.Area unemployment rate drops

JAPAN , from page 1State will try to put bison in sanctuary
son, leaving about 30 females and sterilized male calves 
to continue roaming the prairie. This is a change from the draft plan, which stated only 15 female bison would stay in the prairie.
The male horses, which are part of a herd of about 30 
Florida cracker horses, will either be removed or steril-ized and left to roam.
The Florida Cracker Cattle herd will remain at Hick-
ory Ranch, the park’s cattle ranch.
The plan states that the animals will be removed but 
does not say exactly how or who will take them.
Park manager David Jowers refused to comment.Kirstin Lock, public information officer for the Flori-
da Department of Environmental Protection, said in an email that the details of the removal have not been deter -
mined, but the next step is to draft a request for offers.It says the “first preference” is to put the bison in an 
animal sanctuary . If sanctuaries will not take the males, then the park will find other solutions. 
She said the park will screen everyone who applies 
to take the animals to ensure that the bison are treated humanely.
To remove the animals, the plan states the park will 
need to hire a contractor to round them up.
Some protesters of the plan are 
concerned that the bison will be killed for their meat, an issue which is not specifically addressed in the 
plan. Others are worried the park won’t have as many visitors if the animals are removed.
“You can bet that 70 to 80 percent of those people 
are there to see the bison, the horses and the birds,” said Chuck Littlewood, a wildlife photographer who visits the park weekly.PRAIRIE , from page 1THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
TALLAHASSEE — A new Florida strike force will target 
unscrupulous doctors and pharmaceutical manufacturers il-
legally distributing prescription drugs to addicts and drug dealers, Gov. Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi said 
Monday.
Scott said the project would be paid for with $800,000 in 
unused federal grant money. He noted that 98 of the 100 lead-
ing dispensers of these drugs nationally are doctors who reside in Florida. He’s also bringing in several other state agencies to help the Florida Department of Law Enforcement with the investigation into the trafficking of prescription drugs and so-called pill mills. The pill mills have given the state a deserved but unwanted reputation as a haven for anyone looking for 
such drugs — most often the highly addictive pain-killer oxy-
codone.
More oxycodone is distributed illegally in 
Florida than all other states combined. Most of the illegal activity in Florida is in the areas sur -
rounding Miami, Tampa and Orlando, where 126 million oxycodone pills have been distributed.
“For too long in Florida, drugs have ruined lives and threat-
ened our safety ,” Scott said. “We should be able to figure out 
how to stop this.”
Scott said FDLE Commissioner Gerald Bailey will direct 
the strike force, which is aimed at eliminating the “flamingo 
express” — the nickname given to the pipeline of illicit pre-scription drugs that flow out of Florida to other states, most of which have prescription monitoring systems.
Scott, however, has proposed the state scrap a planned data-
base for tracking prescription drugs, claiming privacy concerns. Bondi is opposed to Scott’s suggestion and trying to work with 
him to find an alternative.
The strike force with also be assisted by the Florida High-
way Patrol, investigators from the Division of Insurance Fraud, 
sheriff’s departments and community police forces. The De-partment of Health and the Agency for Health Care Adminis-tration will provide regulatory and licensing personnel.
The pill mill issue has been Bondi’s primary focus since she 
was sworn in as attorney general less than three months ago.Scott going after

AroundGainesvillepastor type. But a few months 
into organizing the church, he said, the Lord put the burden on him to preach. Since then, he’s gained 120 to 160 followers. He 
gets more every year at church-
sponsored rodeos. 
The church is part of the 
Cross Brand Cowboy Church network of similar churches scattered around the continent. The church is informal and nondenominational. Keith says that’s how he likes it.
“Everything that should be 
happening in a church atmo-sphere is happening,” he said.
Since starting the church, 
Keith has performed two bap-tisms, both in a cow trough out back. He’s also led two wed-dings with the brides wearing little white dresses. The grooms put on their best tuxedo tops and blue jeans.
Keith said informal events 
like those draw his target audi-ence: day-working cowboys. Usually, they are the most reluc-tant ones to attend.
“They don’t like to be around 
people,” he said. “They just like to be around their horses and cows.”
Now, cowboys make up 
three-fourths of the congrega-
tion. Mickey Thornton is one of 
them.
He’s about 5 feet 7 inches tall 
and built like a grizzly bear. He’s usually seen wearing clay-caked Wranglers, dusty work boots and a camouflage ball cap. The only clean thing on his body is a tiny pewter cross that hangs be-tween the top two buttons of his flannel work shirt.
On an average day’s worth of 
work at Whitehurst Cattle Com-pany, he drives 500 head of cat-
tle, tagging ears and castrating 
bulls. He sees the sun rise and set while he’s in the saddle. But he still makes time for church.
Thornton started coming two 
years ago when he saw the sign on S.R. 41 and “came in to see what’s goin’ on.”
He kept making time every 
week and works now as the are-na team leader for the rodeos. That, he says, is what got him out of the North Georgia bars and into barrel races, roundups and prayers.
He leads a five-minute prayer 
before every rodeo event.
“That may be the only word 
of God a cowboy ever gets,” he said. “Whether you need to put Christ in a cowboy or cowboy in a Christian.”
John Young joined the church 
after coming to one of Thorn-ton’s rodeos. Young has been riding his whole life.
“Well, not all of it,” he said. 
“It ain’t over yet.”
He’s the son of a Baptist 
preacher and chose here over any of the area’s churches.  
“Sometimes you just don’t fit in other places,” he said.
The rodeo also brought in 
Glenn Bush. He brought his 12-year-old grandson for mut-ton bustin’ (a rodeo event for children riding sheep) and got to talking with Keith. Bush comes every week now in blue jeans, a white cowboy hat and white boots — his Thursday best.
When prayers have been of-
fered, announcements have been 
read and the 10-gallon hat has 
been passed around as an offer -
ing basket, Keith and the rest of the members join in for prayer.

A review of the effects of high-caffeine 
energy drinks on children and young adults 
suggests they may be linked to health risks 
as serious as heart palpitations, high blood pressure, cardiac arrest and death. 
The review, published in February in Pe-
diatrics, the official journal of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, analyzed scientific 
reports in medical journals, newspaper ar -
ticles and regulatory steps taken in other countries regarding high-caffeine energy 
drinks.
Officials with the American Beverage As-
sociation, however, said the study presents 
some misinformation about energy drinks, claiming an average drink contains only half 
the caffeine of a cup of coffeehouse coffee.
“It’s a hot college topic,” said Shannon 
Kirkpatrick, health promotion specialist 
for GatorWell Health Promotion Services. 
“I have had a lot of students ask me about 
energy drinks. They have packed schedules and think it’s good to find something that provides a boost.” 
The study defines energy drinks as drinks 
that “contain caffeine, taurine, sugars and sweeteners, herbal supplements, and other 
ingredients and are distinct from sports 
drinks and vitamin waters.”
The study concluded that 31 percent of 
12- to 17-year-olds and 34 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds reported regularly consuming 
energy drinks. 
“I have them about every other week,” 
political science freshman Max Goldstein 
said. “It keeps me awake for tailgates … and 
when I have to be up all day.”
An average energy drink contains 70 to 
80 milligrams of caffeine per 8-ounce serv-
ing, about three times the concentration of cola drinks. 
Energy drinks are classified as dietary 
supplements, so the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-ministration cannot limit their caffeine con-tent, as they do with juice and soft drinks, 
which are categorized as food. 
In addition, U.S. poison centers have not 
yet been able to monitor the number of over -
doses associated with energy drinks because 
these episodes are classified as “caffeine” or 
“multi-substance exposure.” 
But Kirkpatrick said overdosing is pos-
sible.
“Dehydration, vomiting, upset stomach, 
irregular heartbeat and, as seen lately in the 
media, even coma and death can occur,” she said.Research

Today’s question: Has your spelling gotten worse over the past five years?Monday’s question:  Should Florida elect its judiciary members?
55% YES45% NO
47 TOTAL VOTESWe Heart the OED
It may come as a sur -
prise, but we aren’t lan-
guage purists. 
If you heard the way we 
talk around the office at times, it’s hard to fathom a coherent product resulting 
from our efforts. 
Even so, we’re a little 
dismayed at the Oxford Eng-
lish Dictionary’s choices for 
newest words. 
We saw “LOL” and 
“OMG” coming; their usage 
has extended even to news headlines. 
However, we’re wonder -
ing who thought including 
“heart” as a verb was a good 
idea.
We usually hear this use 
of the word in a sarcastic 
context, as if the speaker is too current to say the word “love.” The literal reading 
of a   pictograph is too silly 
to be immortalized on pa-per. For instance, doesn’t “I heart you” sound just as 
sincere as those other three words?
In light of this inclusion, 
we’ve brewed up a little theory on these ridiculous 
additions. 
How many people still 
break out the OED — even 
in its online version — to 
look up a word? 
It’s losing ground, but 
one of the ways to flag down some public notice 
is to elect flash-in-the-pan 
words that have no place in a dictionary to go into the book. 
We hear the same story 
ever year. 
The annual additions 
generally include a few le-gitimate entries needed to 
keep the dictionary up to 
date sprinkled among the ludicrous ones needed to stir up some buzz. 
Here’s to hoping it’s a 
cry for help from a respect-ed institution rather than terrible decision-making.
Academic Cred
Professors shouldn’t be 
“strictly business” 
Professors might want to rethink how their students 
perceive them. In a study published in the March is-sue of Learning, Media and Technology, researchers 
found that professors who reveal a bit of their personal lives are viewed as being more credible and more caring by students. 
So maybe the notion we have that a “strictly business” 
demeanor is a good way to appear focused and knowl-edgeable is wrong.
It’s understandable: Students should learn from a pro-
fessor, but knowing that we’re seeing and interacting with a human being puts us at ease and in a better position to 
process information.
We generally don’t mind hearing faculty go on tangents 
about previous work experience, their travels or — for 
those of us who have taken microeconomics — Leonardo’s 
Pizza. Sometimes, we appreciate the break in the monoto-
ny and the chance to connect with our professors.
There’s a balance to be struck, of course, so that we aren’t 
inundated with hour-long epics involving our instructors’ pets, but professors should let that academic and profes-
sional facade slip here and there. Mentioning your family 
or giving a personal opinion on a subject sometimes helps us more than sticking to stripped-down facts. 
Remember: There are reasons robots haven’t replaced 
our faculty.
Spelling worsened by technology crutch
Predictive text technology is a wonderful thing. If you know only a few letters or the beginning of a word, most smartphones will automatically sug-
gest multiple options for what you were looking for. 
Efficient? Yes. Convenient? Yes. Simply astounding 
technology? Definitely. 
Recently, however, I made a shocking discovery; I 
can no longer spell. 
Any word with minimal complication, even one I use 
almost every day, now presents a new challenge if not presented in a technological medium. When asked to spell “across” by my roommate, I found my forehead 
scrunched in an attempt to remember how many C’s 
and S’s there are. Even as I just typed the word “across” in this column, I spelled it “accross” because I knew Microsoft Word would conveniently provide the auto-
corrected text. 
Cellphone technology and word processing func-
tions have become such a crutch that we find ourselves 
less engaged in the mechanical intricacies of our work due to the ease of perfecting them with such functions. 
Always a reader as a child, my vocabulary, spelling and 
grammar were accelerated. Now, years later, I’ve found myself crippled by advanced technologies that will do a majority of my thinking for me. 
People tend to only be as intelligent as they have to 
be. Average people in the world (this excludes those involved in intricately specialized professions such as computer programming) seemingly fall victim to technology which can “think” for them. Spell a word 
wrong? Just right click and select the correct option. 
Need a more scholarly word for a paper? The synonym function will help you. All of these mindless opera-tions allow us to stare blankly at the screen while our mouse perfects our papers and essays. 
Of course, nothing is perfect — 
we all know not to rely on Spell Check — but many functions, such as Thesaurus and even Au-
toComplete, operate virtually 
flawlessly to ease projects which 
would have required much more thought 20 years ago. But does it even matter? How much important writing do we even do off of the computer anyway? Anything 
handwritten is usually brief and in note form — and 
certainly not meant to be professional or scholarly. 
When typing papers or business documents, as long 
as we know a skeleton of a difficult word we can easily 
get the correct word inserted into the correct space. It’s 
a rare occurrence when we are required to accurately spell words on the spot. 
Clearly, technology is not dumbing us down, or we 
wouldn’t have the constant advancements that we do, 
but are the efforts of the programmers and inventors 
slowly encroaching more and more on our brains? It’s a cycle, as new technology allows new information that in return provides new technology, but for the freeloaders 
such as myself, how do we halt total reliance on these 
conveniences? Depending on modern, communication-improving luxuries is like relying on a calculator with-out understanding math: It may yield a correct answer most of the time, but it will eventually fail if you don’t 
know where to put the parenthesis.

As the United States becomes more deeply involved 
in its third war in a Muslim state, comparisons with the war in Iraq are inevitably made. 
Before any discussion of the two conflicts is made, it is 
important to note that the differences between the wars in both Libya and Iraq undeniably differentiate the two conflicts. 
President Barack Obama continued his foreign policy 
trend of limiting U.S. combat involvement in Libya, while former President George W. Bush overwhelmingly devoted 
large numbers of troops to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq — though sustainability concerns limited the number of soldiers he committed as well.
There has been some international support for inter -
vention in Libya, although these resolutions have advo-
cated for a much narrower range of military options than explored in Libya. 
Even the Arab League vote has been regretted substan-
tially by those who voted for it. 
The conflict in Libya has been overwhelmingly por -
trayed as a humanitarian conflict that will protect the lives of civilians, while Iraq was sold to the international community as a security action against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction primarily and a humani-
tarian action secondly.
The bombing of Libya is somewhat similar to the 
NATO assault on Serbia, which saw the international 
community intervening to stop the destructive trend of regional politics. It is worrying that despite suc-
cesses in the Slavic states, the United Nations is still skeptical about the 
capacity of ethnic tensions to ease in 
the region and these developments may be replicated in 
Libya.
Obama sought to differentiate himself from his Repub-
lican peers by committing troops to Libya while confront-ing real concerns in the state. 
However, the basis for this commission is almost iden-
tical to that of Iraq. 
It became increasingly clear that a victory for Col. 
Muammar Gadhafi would set a powerful precedent in the Arab world that autocratic oppression of rebellious movements would lead to an end of political movements against the dictators in question. 
American intervention in Libya would therefore pre-
vent this eventuality and ally the United States with free-dom and democracy in the Middle East, which is a similar justification to that which motivated direct action in the war in Iraq. 
Iraq is a continuing military campaign, which has roots 
in an attitude of self-admiring support for democracy that both predated and survived the revelation that Saddam Hussein did not in fact pursue weapons of mass destruc-
tion. 
This support was meant to convey that the United 
States was allied with the pro-democratic movements in 
the Middle East, though they were certainly less notice-able until a Tunisian man resolved to set himself ablaze. 
The Libyan conflict is therefore another attempt to 
place the United States in a favorable light in the Middle 
East by offering itself as the vanguard of regional democ-
racy.
Because of this, it will have similarly complex prob-
lems later when these attempts run against American in-
terests of maintaining stability and the export of oil from 
the region.
However, the most striking difference between Iraq 
and Libya is that in Iraq,  Bush at least attempted to main-tain a semblance of democracy by lubricating the months 
leading up to the beginning of the conflict with a public 
relations campaign concerning the necessity of the con-flict.
Obama, surprisingly enough, has begun the Libyan 
campaign with little consultation from elected represen-tatives, worrying, as there is a weak withdrawal strategy from Libya similar to that of Iraq where thousands of troops are still stationed. 
Let us not forget that Iraq was originally supposed to 
be a conflict that was concluded in a matter of months, not years. 
It seems reasonable to believe that Libya, while we are 
stilltationed in Iraq, may become Obama’s Iraq. 
The gap of history is so minuscule between the two 
conflicts that it would be inexcusable if this were the case.

UWireWomen’s rights are under attack 
again. 
Florida lawmakers have filed 
a bill that would make it a felony for doc-tors to perform abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy — a blatant violation of wom-en’s rights under Roe v. Wade. Other bills 
include provisions that would force wom-
en to view an ultrasound of the fetus be-fore having an abortion; bar private insur -
ance companies from covering abortions; and add more restrictions to the already 
burdensome parental notice requirements 
for young women. These bills are part of continuing attempts to restrict abortion rights until abortions become completely 
inaccessible to most women. 
Women have been fighting for decades 
to defend our right to control our lives. We demand that our state lawmakers stand up for women’s rights and defeat these new-
est threats.
Abortion involves a woman’s basic 
right to control her own body and the di-
rection of her life; no restrictions on these 
rights are reasonable. 
It is a right connected to all the other 
things in our lives. Women can’t be on equal footing with men if we are unable 
to make life-altering decisions such as 
whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. Childbearing is physically danger -
ous, hard work that involves risks that 
men never face, and women should be 
able to decide whether we want to do it.
In our feminist group, many of us have 
had serious pregnancy scares and some of us, despite a lifetime of birth-control vigi-
lance, became pregnant when we didn’t 
want to be. The fact is it’s a constant strug-gle for women to keep from becoming pregnant. No birth 
control is 100 percent 
effective; they all have side effects, and 
men often refuse to wear condoms.
Women in Florida have faced similar 
threats to our rights before. In October 1989, 10,000 demonstrators marched on Tallahassee when then Gov. Bob Martinez called a special session of the state legisla-ture after vowing Florida would be the first 
state to restrict abortion rights following a 
Supreme Court decision. All of those bills that sought to restrict a woman’s right to abortion died in committee because state 
representatives listened to their constitu-
ents. Martinez was also resoundingly de-feated in the next election. 
Let history be a lesson to those cur -rently in our state legislature. Women will not stand for violations of our rights.  
As the women’s liberation group Red-stockings said in 1971, women need to 
go for what we really want. All women 
should have the right to get an abortion at any time for any reason, regardless of the ability to pay and without waiting peri-ods, consent laws or other hurdles. Women 
should have the right to decide when and 
if we will bear children.
Call your representatives and tell them 
to vote no on House bills 97, 321, 415, 501, 
747, 1127, 1179 and 1247.

For the first time this spring, 
Matt Elam fielded questions from 
the media Monday.
His answers were quiet, bare-
ly even audible, which is why 
the subject he touched on most 
seemed ironic. Elam, a sopho-more, will be tasked with replac-ing all-Southeastern Conference strong safety Ahmad Black, who led the team with 108 tackles and five interceptions last season.
But more important than his 
statistical output, Black emerged 
as the team leader in the first year 
of the post-Tim Tebow era. At UF’s NFL pro day two weeks ago, Will Muschamp called Black “an ambassador to the program.” 
Black was the mouthpiece of 
the Gators, both internally and to the outside world. In September, former coach Urban Meyer com-
pared Florida’s chances of beating 
Kentucky to a coin flip. Later that week, Black joked about Meyer’s comments, sarcastically hinting he had no idea if the Gators could win. Then, at a press conference two days after UF’s 48-14 victory, Black pulled out a coin, indicating how supposedly lucky his team had been.
With little to salvage from a 
disappointing 8-5 season, Meyer 
frequently pointed to the im-
provement of Black, who evolved from a freshman with an attitude problem to someone Meyer called a member of his family. 
Now, Elam is looking to go 
through a similar — albeit accel-erated — transition.
“One of the things I need to 
work on is being a leader,” he said, his voice hardly louder than a whisper. “I’m not used to being vocal. I might have to take on that role.”
As quiet as Elam was Monday, 
one player assured everyone Elam is a much different person while wearing a helmet and pads. 
“He doesn’t have any prob-
lems with his speech,” corner -
back Cody Riggs said. “That’s just Matt. Some people handle the media different, but it only mat-ters how he handles himself on the field. When Matt makes a call, I listen to him.”

n SOUTH CAROLINA STIFLED UF’S 
TOP FIVE HITTERS THIS WEEKEND.

Before No. 4 Florida challenges No. 7 
Florida State tonight at 7 in Jacksonville, 
the heart of the Gators’ order needs to 
exorcise its demons. 
During Florida’s weekend series loss 
to No. 3 South Carolina, its Nos. 1-5 hit-ters combined for just five hits and nine 
strikeouts in 51 at-bats. 
While Nolan Fontana (.322), Daniel 
Pigott (.394) and Preston Tucker (.343) have swung the bats well this season, 
they were stifled by South Carolina’s 
heavy arms.
Fontana recorded the lone RBI from 
Florida’s first five hitters with a sacrifice 
fly in Saturday’s 2-1 win.  The lone bright spot during the 
weekend was their 10 walks.  
Austin Maddox, the cleanup hitter, 
and Brian Johnson, usually slated in the 
five-hole, have been relatively quiet all season. 
As a freshman last year, Maddox was 
the Gators’ best power threat, smashing 
17 home runs. But through 25 games 
in 2011, he has just one 
homer and 10 RBIs. 
“We’re not going to 
win many games when we go 0 for 8 in our 3-4-5 spots,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said after 
Sunday’s 4-3 loss. “It’s that simple. 
They’ve got to produce. They’ve got to 
swing the bat better. 
“Our 3-4-5 guys are going to have to 
hit. If we’re going to want to win some 
games in this league, they got to do a Gators seeking more from 
middle of lineup vs. ‘Noles
I hope Florida fans enjoyed the Gators’ 
low-post dominance Saturday more than UF’s players and coaches seem-
ingly did, because they won’t be see-
ing much of it next year.
Despite Vernon Macklin’s career-
high 25 points, Florida went away from 
him in the final minutes of the team’s 
Elite Eight loss to Butler.
Alex Tyus was visibly upset in the 
postgame press conference because he didn’t get enough late-game looks.
Commentators and analysts boasted 
early and often about the Gators’ all-senior frontcourt of Macklin, Tyus and Chandler Parsons. Yet they were ren-
dered ineffective — arguably by their 
own coaches and teammates —  in the 
most important moment of their ca-
reers.Unfortunately 
for UF fans, they won’t even be 
around to be ig-
nored next sea-son.
The 2011-12 
Gators basketball team will have a drastically differ -
ent look —  one a 
little less seasoned up front and a lot 
deeper in the backcourt.
UF will likely start Patric Young at 
center and Erik Murphy at power for -
ward next year.

two points, four rebounds and six fouls Undersized Florida will miss big

in which Anthony Chiang, Greg Luca, Jesse Simonton and host Adam Berry overcome a gauntlet of technical difficulties to bring you an abbreviated edition of the show.Even if Elam can emulate Black vocally, re-
placing him as the team’s most consistent tack-
ler could be problematic. While he saw more 
game action than most members of Florida’s hyped freshman class last year, his 22 tackles ranked 14th on the team. He also broke up one pass and recovered a fumble.
Perhaps more so than any other player in 
the 2010 recruiting class, Elam signed with the Gators because of his connection to Meyer. 
Elam, who was among the first five play-
ers to verbally commit to UF as a high school junior, actually decommitted from the Gators 
in December 2009 when Meyer 
first stepped down. After Mey-
er assured him that he was in fact returning to Florida, Elam recommitted about a month be-fore National Signing Day.
When asked how he felt 
about Meyer leaving, Elam just smiled and said, “I don’t want to talk about that.” 
He proceeded to say he was getting along 
well with Muschamp and the rest of the new coaching staff.
Just how well they get along with him, how-
ever, could depend greatly on whether Elam can fill Black’s shoes. After a year of serving as Black’s understudy, Elam feels confident the 
transition will be smooth.
“He helped me a lot,” Elam said. “I learned 
a lot from him: the way he practiced, the way 
he handled his situations, things like that.”14, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, MARCH 29, 2011

While the Gators were having trou-
ble getting rest preparing for the Crim-
son Tide last October, Caleb Sturgis was kept awake for another reason.
“I think (my back injury felt the 
worst) right before the Alabama week,” Sturgis said. “I just really couldn’t sleep or anything like that. That was the point where I got every-thing checked out.”
Florida’s kicker went on to miss the 
final eight games of the season with a herniated disk and a stress fracture that was first aggravated in a weight 
lifting session before the season. While 
Sturgis has yet to practice kickoffs this spring, he is slowly making his way back and is already kicking field 
goals.
However, the injury has had linger -
ing effects. Sturgis has cut down on 
weight room work and the number of kicks he attempts in practice to limit the strain on his back.
The injury impacted Sturgis even 
before he was sidelined. He knocked in just two of four field goals in four games before punter Chas Henry filled in for him.
“(Not being able to play) was ob-
viously really rough,” Sturgis said. “I never really in my life had an injury before that kept me out. It was some-thing new for me.”
O-LINE ADJUSTING: Learning the new 
offense hasn’t just been tough on Flor -
ida’s skill players. The offensive line has been asked to make a change from last season, too.
On top of losing Mike Pouncey, 
Carl Johnson and Marcus Gilbert, the group has had to adjust to the new coaching staff’s scheme this spring. Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis’ system demands that the offensive line carry more responsibility.“Everything is different from last 
year,” right guard Jon Halapio said. “Our offensive line coach is not only teaching us techniques, but now we are learning the entire football play. We have to know what the quarterback is thinking, running back is thinking and wide receiver is thinking.”
Sturgis returns to practice after injury
Harrison Diamond / Alligator
UF kicker Caleb Sturgis only played in four games last year due to a herniated 
disk and stress fracture in his back, but he returned to practice this spring.
Elam keeps quiet 
about Meyer’s departure, says he gets along with new staff
FOOTBALL , from page 13better job.”
O’Sullivan said the most frus-
trating issue with his hitters is 
that they are missing hittable 
pitches in offensive counts. 
“We get into a 3-1 count, we 
hit a weak ground ball to first,” 
he said. “You got to turn on it. 
You got to barrel up and do some-thing with it. We’re not doing a whole lot in offensive counts right now.”
O’Sullivan hinted at possible 
lineup changes after Sunday’s defeat, but said he would rather rest on it than make an announce-
ment right after a loss.  
RANDALL THROWING LIGHTS OUT: 
Although the Gators’ lineup had issues this weekend, their right-
handed ace did not. 
Hudson Randall continued his 
outstanding work Saturday, toss-
ing a gem in his first-career com-
plete game as Florida won 2-1. 
The sophomore from Atlanta 
is 4-0 and has a miniscule 0.66 
ERA. 
In two conference starts 
against top-five competition (LSU and South Carolina), Randall has thrown 15.2 innings, without al-lowing a run or a walk.
“I just try to be as competitive 
as possible on the mound and be a bulldog out there,” Randall 
said. “I don’t strike many people 
out. I pitch to contact. Using the defense, using our team, that’s what I do.”
Through six starts this season, 
Randall has thrown 40.2 innings, striking out 25 and walking just one.
Randall was dominant in his 
Saturday start, as he used pin-point control to retire the final 19 Gamecocks. 
South Carolina coach Ray Tan-
ner was extremely impressed, 
comparing Randall to Greg Mad-
dux.
“He’s very, very good,” Tan-
ner said. “He’s so efficient. He doesn’t waste a lot of pitches.”
ETC.: Anthony DeSclafani (3-0, 
1.12) is scheduled to toe the rub-ber tonight against Florida State. 
In the junior’s last start against 
the Seminoles, he allowed five runs in the first inning without retiring a batter.  … The game

Grounds of Jacksonville, home of the Florida Marlins’ Double-A af-filiate.n FLORIDA IS 17 STROKES BEHIND THE LEADER 
IN THE HOOTIE AT BULLS BAY COLLEGIATE.
By ALEX PECKHAM
Alligator Writer
The Florida men’s golf team came into the Hootie at Bulls 
Bay Collegiate hoping to get one last tournament victory 
before moving on to postseason play, but that goal seems 
nearly impossible now. 
The Gators find themselves in ninth place, 17 strokes be-
hind tournament leader Augusta State after Monday’s ac-tion in Awendaw, S.C.  
Florida shot a combined 8-over-par on Day 2, bringing 
its score to 12-over for the tournament.
Sophomore Phillip Choi and junior Michael Furci were 
the two bright spots for the Gators, as both turned in 1-un-der-par 70s. 
Choi’s under-par round was due to a solid back nine that 
included two birdies and no bogeys. Choi is tied for 10th overall.
Furci’s stellar showing was a welcome sign for the junior, 
who has had trouble cracking the starting lineup all year. 
The DePaul transfer not only impressed with his play but 
also his resiliency, as Monday’s round came on the heels of 
a discouraging 6-over-par 77 on Sunday. 
UF coach Buddy Alexander included Furci in the “cou-
ple of guys who played really well today” and added that Michael’s round was “very encouraging.”
Unfortunately for the Gators, the rest of the squad was 
unable to replicate their success. 
Senior Bank Vongvanij had a disappointing round on 
Monday, as did sophomores Tyler McCumber and Tommy 
Mou. 
McCumber, whose game had progressed nicely in last 
week’s Schenkel Invitational and to start the Hootie, shot a 5-over-par 76. The sophomore struggled on his way to a 3-over-par front nine but regained his form before a double-bogey 5 on the par-3 12th set him back to 5-over.
Mou has had trouble putting together a complete round 
all year, and that trend continued Monday when he shot a 5-over-par 76. 
Mou’s day was done in by a seven-hole stretch on the 
front nine that included five bogeys.
The biggest surprise for the Gators was the high score of Bank Vongvanij. The two-time Southeastern Conference 
Golfer of the Week shot a 6-over-par 77, his worst round 
of the season. Alexander said Vongvanij’s struggles “show 
that even the best players can play poorly on occasion.” 
Alexander added he is “pretty sure that (Vongvanij) will 
bounce back (on Tuesday).”
Although the Gators’ chances of winning the Hootie at 
Bulls Bay Invitational are likely finished, Tuesday’s round will be very important for Florida. 
A strong conclusion could help the Gators regain some 
confidence before the SEC Championship begins on April 15. 
Alexander didn’t seem concerned about his team’s play 
going into the most critical part of its schedule.
“I’m pretty sure our team will bounce back,” Alexander 
said.TUESDAY, MARCH 29, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15

1. Kenny Boynton, So.
With a third-place finish in the Week 11 rankings, Boynton broke a 
three-way tie atop the season-long standings. The sophomore guard didn’t lead the team in any statistical category except free-throw percentage (82.3 percent), but our voters gave Boynton some extra respect for being the team’s best defender. The sophomore also came up big in the NCAA Tournament, holding BYU’s Jim -
mer Fredette to 11-of-29 shooting from the field. 
Boynton was a potent scoring threat in the UF 
offense, notching 14.2 points per game, good for second on the team. He was also reliable, 
reaching double figures in scoring in each of the 
team’s final 16 games despite a 38.5 field goal 
percentage and 33.1 three-point percentage. 
HOT SHOTS
4. Vernon Macklin, Sr.
Macklin came into his own as a low-post scoring threat during his 
senior season, finishing third on the team with 11.6 points per game. The center shot a team-leading 59.3 percent from the field with his nearly unstoppable hook shot from the field. Despite his 6-foot-10 
stature, Macklin finished third on the team with 5.4 
rebounds per game. He also ended the year third 
in blocks with 26, and his minutes were limited 
in clutch situations by his 45.1 free-throw per -
centage. Still, the senior center gained respect 
from his teammates for fighting through nag -
ging injuries and providing a humorous presence 
in the locker room.
T-2. Chandler Parsons, Sr.
Parsons was named the SEC Player of the Year after leading the Ga -
tors in rebounds and assists per game with 7.8 and 3.8, respectively. 
Regardless of the national praise he received, the senior forward only tied for second in our standings because he finished fourth on the 
team in scoring at 11.3 points per game and under -
whelmed in his final games. Although he put to -
gether solid marks of 48 percent shooting from 
the field and 36.8 percent from three-point range, he struggled at the line, hitting just 55.7 percent of his attempts. While the forward was 
a valuable presence as a senior leader, he had a 
propensity for disappearing for long stretches. 
5. Alex Tyus, Sr.
Tyus finished the season playing better than anyone on the team, 
recording double-doubles in the team’s final two games. This included an outstanding 19-point, 17-rebound showing in the team’s Sweet 16 victory over BYU. But up to that point in the season, Tyus had been a 
relative disappointment, averaging just 8.6 points 
and 5.7 rebounds per game prior to the final two 
contests despite his superior talent and athleti -
cism. Still, the senior forward shot an impres -
sive 50 percent for the season and finished 
second on UF with 29 blocks.
T-2. Erving Walker, Jr.
Walker finished tied for second with Chandler Parsons in the season-
long standings with 16 points, but the junior guard received first-place honors in four of our weekly polls. Walker was the team’s leading scorer at 14.6 points per game and provided a spark to an offense that was sometimes stagnant and out of sync. The junior scored in a vari -
ety of ways, recording 148 points from two-point 
range, 237 points from three-point range and a 
team-best 154 points from the free-throw line. 
Walker was Florida’s primary ball handler, but he finished the season second with 125 assists while leading the Gators with 87 turnovers. 
Still, Walker was often called upon to take, and 
usually make, clutch shots.

Jocelyne Sanchez and Greg Luca / Alligator Staffin Saturday’s loss against a hopelessly un-
dersized Bulldogs frontcourt. 
Don’t get me wrong: Young is excep-
tionally gifted and will be a great NBA 
player someday, and I think Donovan will 
eventually be proven correct in his com-
parison of Murphy to former Florida for -
ward Matt Bonner. 
But they’re not Macklin, Tyus and Par -
sons.
Those three, the surest things on Flori-
da’s roster, will be gone. 
Erving Walker and Kenny Boynton led 
the Gators with 14.6 and 14.2 points per 
game, respectively. But they did so on a combined 811 shots. The frontcourt trio 
combined for 911.
As much as people criticized Tyus for 
his career-low scoring average of 9.1, he did so while playing the fewest minutes of 
any member of the starting five, hitting 50 percent of his shots and taking 106 fewer 
attempts than Erving Walker — 173 fewer 
than Boynton.
Macklin, meanwhile, was Florida’s 
most offensively efficient player, making a 
staggering 59.3 percent of his attempts. 
And everyone knows Parsons took 
home the SEC Player of the Year award this season, becoming one of the most ver -
satile players in the country. His 2-for-9 
shooting Saturday isn’t indicative of the 
season he had.
Next year, without that trio, it will be 
almost unfair to say Florida will be guard-heavy.
Walker and Boynton will likely con-
tinue to shoulder the load and step into increased leadership roles.
But they might be the third and fourth best guards on the Gators’ roster.  
Mike Rosario, the Rutgers transfer of-
ten forgotten about during the season, will 
suit up for Florida next year. 
It’s safe to assume Donovan is excited 
to utilize the 6-foot-3 guard’s ability to 
create and put the ball in the basket —  he 
scored 16.7 points per game in the Big East 
in 2009-10.
And perhaps most intriguing, the 
Gators will add super-recruit Brad Beal. 
The 6-foot-4 shooting guard from St. 
Louis (Mo.) Chaminade does a little bit of 
everything — and he does it all well. 
It will be impossible to keep him from 
playing significant minutes immediately.
Plus, barring another rush of postsea-
son transfers, Florida will return Casey Prather and Scottie Wilbekin in the back-court. 
Wilbekin certainly performed far above and way beyond expectations, especially as he became the team’s second-best on-the-ball defender, while Prather drew a lot of 
praise for his athleticism, even if he didn’t 
get a chance to show it on the court.
That leaves Young, Murphy, Will Yeg-
uete, a no-longer-redshirted Cody Larson and three-star freshman Walter Pitchford 
in the frontcourt.
The Gators will certainly have enough 
talented guards to carry them to another 
successful season next year, and Young 
and Murphy are capable of developing 
into a reliable starting frontcourt.
But they won’t have a ton of experi-
enced big men. 
Not a whole lot of known quantities. 
Not many sure things. 
They’re all on their way out the door. 
Hopefully the Gators enjoyed them while they could.ADAM , from page 13
