� CITY OFFICIALS GRANTED 
101 CANTINA THE PERMIT IN THE PAST BECAUSE THEY MISUNDERSTOOD THE RULE.
ADRIANNA PAIDAS
Alligator Writer
Cinco de Mayo party-goers 
will not be able to buy alcohol 
in the parking lot of 101 Canti-na like they have in past years.
Management at 101 Cantina 
requested a permit earlier this month to “extend boundaries” in order to sell alcohol under-neath a tent in a neighboring parking lot during its annual Cinco de Mayo celebration on May 5. 
The city denied the permit 
request.
When the city attorney’s of-
fice looked over the request, it found that the permit was against city law. 
However, it had been grant-
ed to the business in the past for events, including for a St. Patrick’s Day celebration about a month ago.
City spokesman Bob Woods 
said the reason the permit was approved in the past was be-cause city staff misinterpreted a city rule that determined whether businesses were al-lowed to sell alcohol outside the business with city permis-sion. 
The rule actually only allows 
this on weekends when there are UF home football games.“There was a misunder-
standing in the past with the ordinance,” Woods said. “Now that we’ve clarified that, we’ve got to exercise due diligence in complying with the ordi-nance.”Management at 101 Cantina 
declined to comment.
Under the city ordinance, a 
permit can be given to a busi-ness that wants to sell alcohol outdoors during the “period of

� HUNDREDS WERE TURNED 
AWAY.

About 500 people watched 
“Parks and Recreation” actor Nick 
Offerman deliver standup and songs, but hundreds more couldn’t ﬁ  t in the room.
Crowds were turned away 
from his Wednesday night perfor-mance. Offerman plays Ron Swan-son on the NBC show.
The line snaked past the Rion 
Ballroom and through hallways on the Reitz Union’s second ﬂ  oor.Attendees were turned away start-ing 30 minutes before the event.
Those who made it in witnessed 
Offerman bound around the room in an unbuttoned American ﬂ  ag shirt before the show.
He joked about the smoke in 
Gainesville, homosexuality and evangelical politics.
“With this homosexuality issue, 
I think we’re losing sight of what really matters — there are vegetar-ians everywhere,” he said.
The free event was hosted by 
Reitz Union Board Entertainment, Accent Speaker’s Bureau and Inter-Residence Hall Association. Offerman was paid $35,000 for the 90-minute performance.
Christie Harrod and Jessica Per-
kins waited in line for three hours, wearing paper bag mustaches.
Harrod, a 22-year-old wildlife 
ecology and conservation senior, said Swanson has been her favorite character since the ﬁ  rst episode.
Mechanical engineering junior 
Scott Jagolinzer said he enjoyed Offerman’s show.
“His whole philosophy on reli-
gion and politics was interesting,” he said.‘Parks and

George Zimmerman was charged 
Wednesday with second-degree murder 45 
days after Sanford police said he shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
Zimmerman, 28, turned himself into au-
thorities. Special prosecutor Angela Corey later announced Zimmerman is being held without bond.
Trayvon’s death made national head-
lines after Sanford police didn’t immedi-ately charge Zimmerman. Some believed Trayvon was targeted for his race, while others said the media was blowing the case out of proportion.The controversy began the night of Feb. 
26, when police said Trayvon walked to his father’s girlfriend’s house from a store unarmed. Zimmerman called authorities 
and said he was following a suspicious person. The two fought, and Zimmer-man shot Trayvon.
Zimmerman told police 
he acted in self defense.
UF law professor Mi-
chelle Jacobs said if he’s convicted of second-de-
gree murder, Zimmerman could face up to 30 years in jail.
“I’m a little surprised at the charges,” 
she said.  Jacobs said she originally thought Zim-
merman would be charged with man-slaughter. Both charges acknowledge the defendant never intended to kill.
She said the two charges differ in the de-
gree of recklessness committed.
For example, she said, if someone threw 
a heavy object off an overpass at 3 a.m. that killed a driver, the person who threw the object would likely be charged with man-slaughter. However, if that same person threw a heavy object at oncoming trafﬁ  c during rush hour, he could be charged with murder.
She said the difference is there’s a great-
er chance someone will get hurt in the sec-ond scenario, which makes the incident more reckless.
Jacobs said Zimmerman will be in court UF reacts to Zimmerman’s murder charge

within 24 hours for his initial 
hearing, where the charges will be explained.
If the case makes it to a jury 
trial, Jacobs said the state pros-ecutor will have to prove Zim-merman didn’t have the right to follow Trayvon and the actions that led to Trayvon’s death were “very” reckless.
Some students said they are 
disappointed with the overall situation.
Michael Keller, 20, said the 
media’s attention to the case has become borderline ridicu-lous.
“Black rights groups turned this into a racist thing,” the civil engineering sophomore said, “when it wasn’t like that to begin with.”
Others celebrated the fact 
that Zimmerman is in cus-tody.
Vincent Adejumo, a UF 
Ph.D. candidate and member of the Black Graduate Student Organization, said he hopes the prosecutor was able to gather enough evidence for a conviction.
“It’s unfortunate that it 
took this long,” the 25-year-old said. “But I’m glad he’s been charged so the justice system can run its course.”

City departments review requests to sell alcohol at outdoor events
the day before the football game and the day of the foot-
ball game.”
Because there is no game on May 5, the permit should 
be denied, said Lee Libby, an assistant city attorney, in an email to Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa explaining the recommendation for the city to deny the bar’s per-mit.
Libby could not be reached directly for comment.Various city departments, including public safety and 
planning, must review a permit to sell alcohol outdoors during special events before it is approved.
Somewhere along the way, Woods said, staff within 
those departments misunderstood the rules.

Journalists might not have good 
hiring prospects, but they could have 
worse jobs — four, to be exact.
Newspaper reporter was ranked 
196 out of 200 on CareerCast.com’s 2012 jobs ranking. Last year, it was No. 188.
The only worse jobs were oil rig 
worker, enlisted military soldier, dairy farmer and — No. 200 — lumberjack.
The rankings were based on work 
environment, stress, income, physical demands and hiring outlook.
UF journalism professor Norman 
Lewis said criticism against newspa-per reporters isn’t new. It can be ap-plied to any field, he said, especially other “helping professions,” such as teaching and social work.
Lewis, who worked in newspapers 
for more than 25 years, changed his major to journalism from computer science during college, even though the latter would have paid more.
He said reporters help people gov-
ern themselves, sift through false-hoods and lead better lives.
But Lawrence Chan, 19, a journal-
ism and English freshman, said he could understand the ranking and doesn’t plan to go into newspapers. He hates the deadlines and hectic hours but thinks the degree is versa-tile.
Journalism freshman Marisa Ross, 
19, said she’s heard criticism in the past but thinks reporters don’t get enough respect.
“Journalism is a necessary field,” 
she said. “Reporters will always be needed.”
The top five jobs, according to the 
website, were software engineer, actu-ary, human resources manager, dental hygenist and financial planner.Reporter places 196 out

A chase involving 2-foot-long incense 
sticks, a purse and a running tackle ended 
Wednesday with one man in jail and another with a sore face.
Carl M. Babb, 50, was arrested after police 
said he snatched a woman’s purse from the Lunchbox restaurant downtown at about 8:50 p.m.
Felipe Echeverri, 33, said he saw Babb take 
the purse and ran after him.
“He looked like a guy you see in prison 
movies,” Echeverri said. “I would have never messed with him if I had actually thought about it.”
A few seconds into the chase, Babb turned 
around and punched Echeverri between the eyes, leaving a visible mark.
Echeverri said he felt groggy but continued 
to chase Babb when Babb threw a handful of lit 2-foot-long sticks of incense backward at him. About 100 feet farther, Babb threw the woman’s purse.Echeverri tackled Babb and pinned him to 
the ground. He said he tried to reach for his cellphone when a crowd that had gathered began to yell, “He’s reaching for his pocket!”
Sensing that the crowd thought he had 
bad intentions, Echeverri tried to explain that Babb stole a woman’s purse, punched him in the face and needed to be held until police ar-rived.
While most of the crowd bought the story, 
Echeverri said about three others got in between him 
and Babb, allowing Babb to run away.
Police caught up with 
him at the corner of North-east First Street and North-east Fourth Avenue.
Babb was arrested for 
robbery by sudden snatching and battery.
Although his head hurt, Echeverri said he 
considered himself lucky.
“He could have just as easily done some-
thing much worse,” he said.

Scott vetoes bill     
offering treatment 
A report by the Florida Department of Corrections showed that 26.1 percent of all prisoners admitted for the fiscal year 2010-2011 were incarcerated for non-vi-
olent drug offenses, the most common type of offense for the year. As of June 30, 2011, non-violent drug offenders made up 18.4 percent of the total inmate population, still the most of any crime.
In terms of those incarcerated for mere possession of drugs 
(in other words, those not convicted of trafficking, manufactur -
ing, selling or purchasing drugs), this group made up 26.8 per -
cent of all non-violent drug offenders for the same fiscal year.
Because drug laws are largely enforced at the federal level, 
the statistics for drug offenders under federal jurisdiction are even more grim. A report by the U.S. Justice Department found that 51.1 percent of federal inmates were incarcerated for drug offenses.
A bill that passed the Florida House of Representatives by 
112-4 and the Florida Senate by 40-0 would have helped drug-addicted inmates receive treatment after serving half of their sentence. According to the Miami Herald, the program would have only helped non-violent drug offenders, as long as they met certain conditions such as good behavior.
Unfortunately for these inmates, guilty of nothing but being 
addicted to drugs, Gov. Rick Scott vetoed the bill on Friday.
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, a Fort 
Lauderdale Republican, who argued the bill “would save tax-payers’ money by reducing the chance that inmates would re-offend by getting them the help they need,” according to the Herald.
In his veto message, Scott wrote that “victims of crime” 
would not be able to receive justice if “a criminal is permitted to be released early from a sentence imposed by the courts.”
But who are the victims when the inmates affected by this 
bill are non-violent offenders?
Did Scott even read the bill?Is he so concerned about looking “soft on crime” that he 
would veto any bill that gave a sense of dignity to inmates in the Florida corrections system?
If anything, keeping those addicted to drugs locked up for a 
full sentence without allowing them to seek help will not pre-vent them from being repeat offenders.
Their imprisonment will likely foster their addiction, in-
crease their resentfulness of the justice system, extend their time surrounded by truly violent criminals, and ruin their chances of ever becoming a productive member of society once they are released.
If anything, our corrections system should be about rehabil-
itation and retribution. While the prospects of rehabilitation for extremely violent criminals are quite dim, helping non-violent offenders can only yield positive results.Summer plans can be tough to make
It’s that time of the year when everyone’s asking about 
summer plans. By now, we all spew that scripted an-swer — a summer job, studying abroad, going back 
home or even staying in Gainesville. Then there’s perhaps the most visible breed: those who’ve snagged a prestigious summer internship.
Whether it’s working in Sen. Bill Nelson’s D.C. office, 
interning for UNICEF in Austria or teaching English in Italy, the honor of these achievements garners more than 50 “likes” on Facebook and inevitably ends up at the top of my news feed. Great. Usually, it’s those people who are so on top of their s--t that they’ve been applying since October — as if their 4.0s and multi-page resumes aren’t frustrating enough.
I can’t help but internally roll my eyes as I offer my con-
gratulations to them. And let’s be honest, it’s mostly out of my own jealousy. The more impressive, the more annoyed I get with my lack of summer plans.
Like most people seeking something to occupy the next 
three months, I obligatorily attached my resume and cover letter to 30 or more internships. I was rejected from most. 
The few interviews I had resulted in nothing substan-
tial. I’m now relying on the last few — the scraps of my ambition.
Or there’s always Plan B: staying at home with nothing 
to do but stare at a wall. No thanks.
I got to thinking, though. What is an internship any-
way? Why do I want one so badly? Why do I need one so badly? 
The current culture of our university system has pro-
moted this notion that climbing the ladder of academic success means snagging the most impressive summer plans. It’s as if the way you fill these next three months is some indicator of future achievement.
And, well, it kind of is. The news is filled with profiles of 
rich and famous people who began their careers as interns with their respective companies. Often, a summer intern-ship means the networking and connections necessary for future job opportunities, which is perhaps why prestigious summer plans are so sought after.These “sought after” summer 
occupations fall into three dis-tinct categories: the paid intern-ships, the unpaid internship and the pay-for-it-yourself internship. But ultimately, the substance of all of these jobs amounts to doing the same things: the mundane of-fice tasks that no other employee wants to do.
The paid internship is the rarest breed, and only a se-
lect few students achieve profitability during the summer months. Usually seen in the form of a stipend, the payment from these opportunities often stems from private compa-nies with money to throw away — Wells Fargo, General Electric Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The usual suspects.
Then there’s the unpaid internship, which often takes 
the form of a mid-tier company based in your hometown. Students often find themselves sustained by the shelter and food of their parents while commuting to local companies to intern as office workers in law firms, power companies and dental offices.
Finally, the most common summertime occupation 
takes the form of the internship in which you pay for the privilege of working — in a way. These unpaid jobs re-quire the student to move to a different city, and the living expenses of food, housing and transportation amount to monetary deficits. The usual culprits for these opportuni-ties are often cash-strapped government agencies in Wash-ington, D.C., or advertising firms in New York City willing to take advantage of students looking to “network.”
I don’t mean to bash internships. I’m looking just as 
hard as anyone — hopefully for something on Capitol Hill. It’s just funny how hard everyone tries, how much expecta-tion goes into the experience, and how often the results are disappointing. In the end, though, if I do get my internship on Capitol Hill, I fully expect 50-plus “likes” on Facebook.

Ever since New Kids on the Block 
(NKOTB, if ya nasty) crooned their way onto the popular music scene 
in the 1990s, the musical staple known as the “boy band” has evolved into a larger-than-life cultural phenomenon that has transfixed tweens for several generations. With the recent re-emergence of boy band popularity fostered in groups like One Direction and The Wanted, these groups have continued to make teenage girls emit the shrill sounds only they can produce;  the progression of the styles and fads that boy bands adapt has only helped establish the genre as arguably one of the most in-fluential in music history.
This “evolution” has inspired all sorts 
of sub genres of boy bands – there are the baby-faced newcomers (One Direction is rapidly rising), the sensitive older sexpots (à la 98 Degrees or The Wanted) and ev-erything in between. 
The cute crooners and smooth steppers 
that populate the boy band genre have become part of an important musical pro-gression that has changed the music in-dustry, arguably for better and worse.
The key to the boy band success? There 
are many. 
From mass marketing, to simple video 
staples, there is, by now, a set series of steps that can ensure a pop music victory. 
Here are a few of the more notable fads that, both in the past and in the present, have established many superstars:
1. Maintain the “Five Member     
Formula”
Most of the more successful groups, par -
ticularly NKOTB, *NSYNC and Backstreet 
Boys, fulfilled a five-member quota, with each member being fitted with a discern-ible “trait.” For example, *NSYNC’s Jus-tin Timberlake and BSB’s Nick Carter be-came the “heartthrobs” of their respective groups, earning the more high-pitched, sickly sweet solos in the singles. 
The bad boys, like NKOTB’s Donnie 
Wahlberg and BSB’s A.J. McLean, garnered squeals through their soulful sections. 
While these guys were stealing the spot-
light, each group always had one to two “backup” members (I mean, does anyone even recognize the name Danny Wood?). 
Yet, the number five became a staple 
in maintaining the immaculately choreo-graphed balance that triggered boy band hysteria. (Just watch any NSYNC video and try to pinpoint just when Timberlake wasn’t in the very front.)
2. Establish A General Group Style
Fashions come and go (and sometimes 
return), but boy bands (and their stylists) have taken it upon themselves to high-light the trendiest clothes as a whole, yet still coincide with each guy’s “trait.” The combination of leather jackets and tight jeans showed the “Hangin’ Tough” side of NKOTB, but only Wahlberg was “bad” enough to don a Public Enemy tee under the frayed sleeves. 
During NSYNC’s “No Strings Attached” 
tour, with the boys acting as marionettes on stage in a nod to the now famous al-bum cover, the bedazzled rip-away vests and pants (for easier transitions from song to song, of course) were sported by all, but only Timberlake was allowed to cover his curly locks with an equally jeweled ban-dana, signifying him as the teen phenom-enon “trendsetter.” 
Also, when a video treatment called for 
a shirtless scene, not all members would be baring their chests. In BSB’s oldie but goodie “Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)” video, everyone but the “thought-ful” Brian was slowly sliding through the rain with open shirts, lamenting about a troublesome lady friend. 
Whatever the style, boy bands have 
been known to make the combination of rambunctious and ridiculous irresistible to fans.
3. Whatever You Do, Hide The In-
nuendo with a Wink or Smile
Let’s face it: At a young age, many 
young girls couldn’t distinguish the las-
civious lyrics of some of the biggest pop songs, so easily hidden by slick beats and smooth singers. 
Besides, if fans weren’t so (annoyingly) 
persistent with buying the records and memorabilia, would parents have had any other choice than to submit to their child, ignoring the hidden messages? 
Albeit, many fans (myself included) 
were too young to properly understand just how raunchy the lyrics and subse-quent choreographed thrusts were. 
We were just excited that the guys were 
so intent on their craft (and just how cute they were doing it!). 
Thus, the guise of sly winks and sweet 
smiles became a crucial aspect of staying on top of the pop music game. 
Without it, who knows how many 
moms would have let their child listen to the records?
There are many aspects, facets and 
eras of the boy-band phenomenon, and it continues to spawn new trends and fresh faces. 
However, in a digitally competent mu-
sic age, groups like One Direction and The Wanted will have to adapt to the mass market in a highly different way than the CD-based groups of the late 1990s. 
Additionally, with time-tested bands 
like 98 Degrees and the super-combo of NKOTBSB trying to light an old flame by embarking on “reunion” tours, the age of the boy band continues to be a prevalent force in the music industry. 
Only time will tell just how powerful 
the impact of the boy band will be on cul-ture for years to come.It’s Totally, Like, The Evolution of the Boy Band!

American audiences definitely love the cute British boy band.

When popular bands like New Kids on the Block and Backstreet Boys combine to form 
a supergroup, the result is a resurgence of the genre: boy bands are here to stay.Groups won’t go out of styleALEXANDRA ANNAN

A local Gainesville band could be playing 
at one of the largest annual music festivals in 
Tennessee this summer.
Far Away Planes, a band that describes it-
self as indie rock with a “dancy” feel, is cur -
rently in a contest for the chance to play the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tenn., June 7 to June 10.
Bonnaroo takes place on 700 acres in Man-chester, Tenn., and includes 150 performances on more than 10 stages.
The Bonnaroo: Road to Roo contest voting 
began on April 2 and will end April 16. The contest includes more than 200 bands and Gainesville’s Far Away Planes is at the num-ber 12 spot as of Thursday.
“Basically, the contest is based on votes,” 
said Luke Sipka, keyboard player for Far Away Planes and junior telecommunication student at UF. “They take the top 10 with the most votes, and then those 10 are submitted to the ‘Bonnaroo music panel.’ Then they pick the two bands that will actually get to play at the festival.”Even with four days still left in the contest, 
the band is already seeing positive results.
“The biggest goal is always to get as many 
people as possible to hear your music,” Sipka said. “It’s exciting to go on the website and check the rankings every day. Seeing that we’ve been in the top 10 nationwide at one point is kind of crazy.”
For Sipka, being a part of Far Away Planes 
has been a positive experience unlike some past ones.  8, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 2012

Would you want to see beer bottles, empty nacho contain-
ers, soda cups, plastic merchandise bags, forgotten posters, 
broken-off wristbands, fallen ticket stubs on your property?
Because these are just a few of the items left in heaps on the 
ground of the Bank Atlantic Center in Sunrise, Fla., after a sold-out performance by the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 2.
This is a familiar scene at the end of any given night at ma-
jor venues such as the Bank Atlantic and Stephen C. O’Connell centers. 
Trash piles up throughout the hours, and at the end of the 
night trash is all that remains. But what is done with that trash is what counts.
In the past year, the O’Connell Center has taken steps to-
ward running a more eco-friendly venue through paper and 
plastic recycling incentives.
The O’Connell Center, which seats 12,000 
people in the main arena, serves UF and the Gainesville community regularly. 
Going green is a large task to which the 
O’Connell Center staff has responded to  whether it is through sporting events such as the ever-popular Gator basketball games, 
concerts, such as Drake’s recent performance there, or argu-ably the most important event hosted there: commencement ceremonies.“We have a team right now that is called the Green Team,” 
said Diana Caglianone, O’Connell Center senior event coordi-nator.  
“They go to meetings and they congregate with other mem-
bers of campus and determine what would be a good way to make green policies.”
In an effort to encourage event attendees to improve their 
recycling efforts, 44 recycling bins have been put inside the 296,000-square-foot building, Caglianone said.
A main initiative started by the O’Connell Center Green 
Team, which consist of four or five students who are advised by staff, is to reduce paper waste.
To find out more of what the O’Connell Center is doing to 
promote green efforts, visit www.alligator.org/the_avenue/.Sustainability efforts expanded at O’Connell Center“We at least get to say we tried 
and put ourselves out there instead 
of sitting at home and just wishing 
someone would come knocking on 
our door.”

Band was at No. 12 position with five days left in voting contest
“I’ve been in other bands where people 
are selfish, but everybody in this band is very 
close, and it’s a very organic writing process,” Sipka said. “It’s nice and relaxing to be a part of something like that compared to past expe-riences.
In addition to Sipka, the band consists of bassist Tim Anderson, singer and guitarist John Ketcham and drummer Kevin Biegler, who all attend UF. Guitarist John Stoltz at-tends Santa Fe College.  
The band, officially formed in February 
2011, mostly plays shows in Gainesville, but hopes Bonnaroo will give the band the big stage it desires.
“I’ve been to Bonnaroo twice, and it’s like 
my dream show,” Sipka said. “It would be the greatest thing I’d ever do.”
For Sipka and Far Away 
Planes, a lot of things can come from this contest. Even if the band does not win, it has been able to generate buzz and get new people listening. According to Sipka, the band members 
have also been able to talk to other musicians around the country because of the contest.
“We at least get to say we tried and put 
ourselves out there instead of sitting at home and just wishing someone would come knock-ing on our door,” Sipka said. “Hopefully more fans will come of this and it will create a more loyal following. If we win, everyone will be able to feel like they contributed and that’d be cool to share something like that with the fans. It’s just about increasing our voice.”

Like a good work of theater should do, last 
weekend’s New Works Festival forced audi-
ences to examine themselves through a criti-cal lens and made them laugh the whole way through.
The fifth annual festival, presented by Flor -
ida Players at the Phillips Center for the Per -
forming Arts, featured three short plays by UF students Andrew Bailes, Amelia Harris and Josh Sallerson.
In keeping with Florida Players’ style, the 
works presented at the festival were more re-latable to students than the mainstage produc-tions of the School of Theatre were.
This is probably due 
in part to the fact that the works that were written, directed and produced by students, but another reason for the increased accessibil-ity of these works is that the playwrights didn’t seem to try to impress anyone.
The festival opened with Bailes’ “Front 
Porch Play ,” the story of a friendship between a graduate student and a recovering drug addict, presented through a lens of racial in-equality.
When a playwright tries to make a com-
ment about an issue as heavy and nuanced as racism, he or she can unconsciously (or con-sciously) bash his audience over the head with it.
Bailes didn’t whitewash or oversimplify his 
protagonists Abe, the privileged white gradu-ate student played by Logan Wolfe, and Mo-ses, a black man trying to stay off the streets, played by Joel Oramas. 
Wolfe and Oramas’ easy chemistry adds 
even more believability to the work.Abe and Moses both possess elements of 
good and evil, evidenced throughout the hour long work.
During a conversation about religion be-
tween the two, Abe, defending his atheist be-liefs, says everyone has a right to an opinion. To this, Moses replies that everyone has a right to be an ignorant motherf***er, amid raucous laughter from the audience.
The play gets serious quickly, ending after 
Abe is stabbed by Moses’ drug-abusing ex-girlfriend. The open ending on a note of vio-lence is jarring, but it solidifies Bailes’ message that racial inequality still pervades what some consider a post-racial society.
“12.21.12,” written by Amelia Harris and 
directed by Colin Hudson, is much lighter fare.
Harris’ 45-minute work consists of a hand-
ful of interrelated storylines, played out in scenes as short as 30 seconds, depicting the last day of the Mayan calendar.
Although the work seemed at first to ven-
ture into the absurd, the intersectionality of the plot eventually reveals how connected all humans are, even as strangers.A pot-smoking college student who kid-
naps and accidentally drowns a girl she’s as-signed as a role model to, a pill-happy Chris-tian missionary who commits suicide when he realizes he’s gay and a young psychiatrist struggling with his father’s mental and finan-cial issues all intersect through their relation-ship with Lane, played by Rhiannon Tasker.
Lane is a reflection of us all, insecure with 
her appearance and desperate for attention from her friends and loved ones.
Confused by messages from her aforemen-
tioned missionary boyfriend, Lane gets plastic surgery, only to find out too late the psychia-trist friend she secretly loves will only be with her if she stays as she is.
New Works closed on an uproarious cre-
scendo of wild with Josh Sallerson’s “The Bender Method.”
Without being heavy-handed, Sallerson 
managed to completely defy traditional gen-der classification with Princess Queely and her three descendents, all sporting massive female and male genitalia.
In about 30 minutes, Princess Queely, a 
genderless alien played by Logan Wolfe, takes a clean-cut youth named Sam, played by Fer -
nando Masterson, on a sexual journey through the universe.
While Princess Queely helps Sam accept 
his feminine side, the plot of “The Bender Method” incorporates neon costuming, a few dozen yards of bubble wrap and an eclectic performance of “Total Eclipse of the Heart” to underscore its theme of breaking gender ste-reotypes.
Juxtaposed with all of that colorful brouha-
ha is Sam’s chaste, straight-laced sister Mary, played by Gabriela Barrios.
And Sallerson’s message about being the 
person you were born to be and embracing sexuality makes it all the way through the bubble wrap.NICOLE LA HOZ

At 18, Ariana Grande already 
knows her future.
“I’m going to be an 80-year-old 
lady looking through a book of my 
Tweets,” she said.
Grande, who’s known as the 
burgundy-haired Cat Valentine on the TV show “Victorious,” docu-ments her life every day. Whether it’s a video of her doing impeccable Shakira impressions or a picture of her behind the scenes, the update goes on Twitter. It’s a natural part of her day.
“I don’t ever want to forget any-
thing.”
Once filming for the Nickelodeon 
show wraps up in July , Grande will focus on releasing her long-awaited debut album with Universal Repub-lic Records.
“I’ve put my everything into it,” 
she said. “I don’t keep a journal any-more; it’s all my music.”
Though finishing the record has 
been a slow process, Grande said she couldn’t be prouder of the prog-ress.
She describes the tracklist as her 
life over the past eight months with a melody. It’s honest, romantic, re-latable and young with some throw-backs. 
Grande is incorporating Motown 
and ‘50s-‘60s pop on the album, a complement to her soulful vocals.“Put Your Hearts Up,” her warm, 
uplifting first single, entered the pop charts at No. 25 last winter.
“’Put Your Hearts Up’ is about 
love and kindness, especially be-cause my fans are at an age when acceptance is scary and rare, and kids are harsh toward one another,” Grande said. “It’s a sweet, simple message, but it means a lot to me.”
She emulates that positivity in 
her role on “Victorious.” Grande plays Cat, an adorable, always-smiling, sometimes-ditzy student at Hollywood Arts High School.
The show, which is now in its 
third season, recently took home a Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite TV Show.
“We died,” Grande said. Her 
mouth remained wide open -- hand glued to her chest -- as the cast walked up to accept the award.
“I really, really couldn’t be hap-
pier,” Grande said. “It’s not pos-sible.”
Her performing status began ris-
ing at 15, when she starred as Char -
lotte in the Broadway musical “13” (along with her “Victorious” costar Elizabeth Gillies). Grande won a National Youth Theatre Association Award the following year.
When she had to move from her 
hometown of Boca Raton to New York, Grande didn’t fret. In fact, it was a comfortable transition.
Grande and her best friend of 
eight years were cast in the musical.Now, Grande soaks in as much 
of home as possible when visiting South Florida. She’ll always find time for the Town Center at Boca and eating at Stir Crazy every night.
“It’s my favorite restaurant in 
the whole entire world,” she said. “I don’t understand why they don’t have one in LA.”
People can also find Grande 
running around the town center screaming with friends, eating choc-olate-covered bananas and “making fools” of themselves. 
Grande was never the shy type.She created a YouTube page, 
Freaky Forever, at age 12. On it are music videos by her and friends in Boca Raton. Some videos include dancing around her room. The vid-eos now have over a million views thanks to Grande’s recent fame.
“That’s why I love being Internet-
obsessed: memories.”
As her presence skyrockets this 
year, one thing remains constant in Grande’s life: her passion for per -
forming. 
She plans on releasing two more 
singles and music videos before her album release.
As custom, Grande guarantees 
steady amounts of updates and foot-age from the studio.
“I was really happy on Broad-
way, I’m happy on TV and I’m hap-py making music,” she said. “I just want to be creating and entertaining as long as I live.”

After just one season playing for 
the Gators, Walter Pitchford an-
nounced Wednesday that he is trans-ferring from Florida’s basketball team.
The 6-foot-10, 221-pound forward 
saw just 22 minutes of playing time off the bench during his freshman season at UF, scoring six points and grabbing four rebounds in 13 games.
Coach Billy Donovan cited Pitch-
ford’s wish to be closer to his family in Michigan as his main reason for leaving the program, according to a university release.
“It’s definitely the best thing for 
him and his family, just with some of his extenuating circumstances. Right now, he just needs to be near his fam-ily,” Donovan said. “They need him home and they want him home.” 
Pitchford came to UF as a three-
star center out of East Lansing (Mich.) Summit Christian Academy. His de-parture leaves Florida one scholar -
ship below the NCAA limit, creat-
ing an opportunity for another recruit to commit to the Gators before the late signing period is over on May 16.
“Even though 
he didn’t play a lot this year, his at-
titude every day was phenomenal; always good energy, always good enthusiasm,” Donovan said. “I don’t remember him ever having a bad day attitude-wise. He was always about the team.”

It’s a mantra that UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan has re-
peated all season. 
“The bottom line is we go as they go.”
Through weeks of good wins and a recent stretch of 
bad losses, O’Sullivan made it clear the Gators will only reach their potential if stars like Mike Zunino, Preston Tucker and Brian Johnson do the same. It was the reason why Johnson started on a Tuesday night in Tallahassee after opening a weekend series against LSU five days be-fore. 
“If we hadn’t been in the situation we were in, having 
lost five of seven, maybe things would have been differ -
ent, but I thought we needed a win,” O’Sullivan said after the game. 
Against No. 1 FSU, the guiding figures were there. Zu-
nino had two hits, including a two-run homer in the fifth. Tucker had a hit, while Nolan Fontana and Johnson each notched solo homers. Johnson’s start lasted just three in-nings, accounting for all three FSU runs. 
But climbing out of a rut took more than the Gators 
rolling out their list of 2012 Major League Baseball Draft prospects. 
Johnson’s rough start could have spiraled into a Semi-
noles run-scoring derby had it not been for Ryan Harris, a previously sparingly used right-handed freshman who retired nine batters in a row and picked up the win. 
Three of Harris’ previous seven appearances had come 
against Florida Atlantic, Florida A&M and North Flori-da. Zunino’s home run wouldn’t have meant as much had 
freshman second baseman Casey Turgeon not singled be-fore him. One inning later, Turgeon singled in Fontana for the go-ahead run. “He’s a pest, man,” Zunino said of Turgeon. “I 
wouldn’t want to pitch against him. He just barrels

Emily Dohony and Kitty Cullen have 
good reason to be scared.
But they aren’t.
Both players have suffered head injuries 
in the past three weeks, but neither has res-ervations about being back on the field with-out taking additional safety measures.
Cullen, a junior attacker, sustained a con-
cussion in the Gators’ 10-8 win at Ohio State on March 24. She hit the ground in the first half and was struck from behind in the head or neck area in the second half, but the team could not determine which play caused the concussion. She returned to the lineup against Johns Hopkins on Saturday after missing two games.  
Cullen said additional action does not 
need to be taken to improve safety because doing so could make women’s lacrosse as physical as men’s lacrosse.
“I think it’s a pretty safe game,” Cullen 
said. “It always could be safer if we wore helmets, but then people might get more ag-gressive.”
Dohony, a junior defender, had to leave 
Saturday’s game against Johns Hopkins af-ter she was hit by an attackers’ stick, open-ing up a cut on her forehead that bled pro-fusely. 
Women’s lacrosse players currently have 
the option to wear a soft rugby-style helmet, but no Gator has opted for the extra protec-tion.
Both Dohony and Cullen cited comfort, 
and Cullen also said she thinks it could re-strict her peripheral vision.
Cullen became the second Gator to suf-
fer a concussion in as many seasons, as junior midfielder Brittany Dashiell lost consciousness after falling chin-first onto Cullen, Dohony against rules 
changes despite head injuries

Turgeon responded: “I mean if I’m a pest, I guess 
that’s a good thing.”
With the fifth-highest average (.294) on the team, 
Turgeon is becoming someone the Gators rely on. With 
eight hits in Florida’s past five games, he’s proving to be a difficult out. 
Two men over, junior Cody Dent can say the exact 
opposite. Since he began filling in for injured third baseman Josh Tobias, Dent is 3 for 29 with 12 strikeouts and one RBI. But on Tuesday night, he found a way to factor into UF’s win. 
Dent was perfect fielding five ground balls and suc-
cessfully bunted Vickash Ramjit and Fontana to second and third before Turgeon’s RBI single in the sixth. It was his second successful sacrifice of the game. 
“It’s awesome,” Turgeon said. “He’s helping the team out in every way he can pos-
sibly do it.”
O’Sullivan might have to broaden his team slogan.16, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 2012

Nassim Slilam has a new haircut. He gave 
up his long hair and took on a much more pol-
ished look. Now, he is working on polishing his game.
The lone senior on No. 10 Florida, Slilam 
has had a spring full of ups and downs. His 8-7 record in singles is indicative of a player who hasn’t quite found his best stroke. But Slilam, who is entering the final phase of his Florida career, said he is finally beginning to play his best tennis.
“I just needed some confidence and to find 
my game,” he said. “On the baseline, I’m feel-ing really good right now. I have to hit some good shots and come to the net more often. Don’t go for the big serve, just get it in and play heavy with my forehand. I have to not back up on the baseline with my backhand.”
Earlier in the season, coach Andy Jackson 
made a remark one doesn’t hear often about a player — Slilam was trying too hard. Jack-son said that his senior was running around the court an excessive amount. While Slilam is one of the more physically fit members of the Gators, Jackson was encouraging him to create offense to reduce the amount he was running. 
Although his record may not indicate much 
of a change, Slilam noted that he was running less and getting in a more aggressive mindset. The key, he said, has been shifting his playing style from a defensive style where extending points is the goal to an offensive style where 
he looks to end points quickly.
“I’m just trying right now to hit the ball,” he 
said. “All the matches I’ve lost, I was defensive 
and the other guys were playing more aggres-sive than me. I lost a lot of matches like that. I was too far away from the baseline, I don’t see the ball, I play short and I have to run more and get tired. I’m good physically , but I lost a lot of three-set matches. “
By losing in three sets to Mississippi’s Mar -
cel Thiemann on Sunday, Slilam dropped to 1-3 in three-set matches. That is particularly troubling because of Slilam’s fitness. His game is designed to wear down opponents. Instead, opponents are able to beat him with aggres-sive play . 
Recently, though, Slilam has been showing 
signs of improvement. He has become much more confident in his ground strokes, and has been displaying very good cross-court shots in recent matches. What he hasn’t done to date is put everything together. Jackson believes that Slilam is much better than his record, and once the senior begins to play aggressively and still wear down opponents, he could make his fi-nal few weeks as a Gator memorable.

The Gators probably wish they 
could have used some of their 14 
runs from Sunday in Wednesday’s game. 
Or, at the very least, borrow a 
couple hits.
Instead, No. 3 Florida (35-5) was 
left with a zero in the runs column for the second time this year and a mere two hits against unranked UCF (30-10) on Wednesday night. 
 “We just have to work on stay-
ing and looking for our pitches and I think that’s the key,” pitching coach Jennifer Rocha said. 
“You have got to come out 
strong, especially in an in-state ri-valry like UCF. They’re always go-ing to bring their ‘A’ game against us.”
The Gators’ offense reached a 
season low in Orlando against the Knights. 
Not only was UF shut out for the 
first time since playing Tennessee on March 9, but it was the first time in more than a year Florida was held without a run and held to two or fewer hits.
In that game against Nebraska 
on March 12, 2011, Michelle Moul-trie and Megan Bush each had one hit. Moultrie collected the only two hits for her team this go-around.
“We didn’t play awful,” Moultrie 
said. “But we just didn’t get the job done. You have to give their pitcher credit but we need to make better adjustments at the plate. There are 
always things you can take to get bet-ter.”
When Bailey 
Castro led the charge against Ole Miss this past weekend with three home runs 
and eight RBI, it seemed as if the  Gators’ lineup was truly starting to click and come together in time for the postseason.
Instead, Florida took a nose dive, 
striking out 11 times against UCF’s Mackenzie Audus (16-5) while los-ing to its second game this year to an in-state rival, with the first com-ing to USF on March 28. 
Unfortunately for sophomore 
Hannah Rogers, who dropped her third game of the year, this has happened before. 
In Rogers’ first loss, a 1-0 defeat 
against Tennessee, she gave up an unearned run in the bottom of the seventh to end the game because her team failed to provide any sort of run support.
In Wednesday’s game, she al-
lowed a two-run double before even notching the first out of the first inning. 
Rogers was then lights out for 
the remainder of the game, allow-ing only one more hit while strik-ing out seven.
However, the first inning was 
all the Knights needed to earn their first win over the Gators in nearly four years. 
“I just try to keep faith in my 
team, hoping they are going to get some runs across the plate for me,” Rogers said. 
“But [Wednesday] wasn’t our 
night. I’m upset. But we have to come back ready to play.”
UF shut out, records two hits in loss to UCF“I just needed some confidence 
and to find my game.”

Bigler Field in 2011. 
Junior defender Sam Farrell 
was also held out of Florida’s game against Detroit University earlier this season for precau-tionary reasons after being hit by a ball on the top of her head in warm-ups.
Despite the pattern of head in-
juries to her players, coach Aman-da O’Leary is also content with the safety measures in women’s lacrosse such as the new rule im-plemented prior to the season that puts a team down a man for two minutes for receiving a yellow card.
“The repercussions of yellow 
cards are so significant, playing a man down, that I think it has helped control a lot of the excess fouling,” O’Leary said. “You can’t really prevent every injury from happening.”
She has no plans to require her 
team to wear helmets, but the ath-letic department would cover the cost if those plans change.
“We tell our players that what-
ever protective gear that is al-lowed within the rules we will provide for them,” O’Leary said. “The rules of the game are meant to keep our game safe and over -
all I think our game is very safe … I don’t feel like I would need to step in and require our team to wear helmets.”
Dohony said she thought the 
play was incidental, and said it’s not something she’s worried will happen again.
“I feel safe,” Dohony said. “I’ve been playing for over 10 
years and nothing has happened yet. So I’m just lucky this is the first time, and I’m ready to play again.”
