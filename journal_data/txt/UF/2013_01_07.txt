A semitruck transporting 
cattle crashed on Interstate 75 
south of West Newberry Road, causing several hours of trafﬁ  c delays Saturday afternoon.
The incident happened at 
about noon.
Travis Carr, a 20-year-old 
Okeechobee resident, was driving southbound in his semitruck when one of the truck’s front wheels blew out, according to a Florida Highway Patrol accident report.
The truck veered right and 
struck a guardrail, according to the report.
It continued south over the 
road shoulder until it crashed into a tree line near Mile Marker 387.
FHP ofﬁ  cers and Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce deputies responded to the crash.
They redirecting highway 
trafﬁ  c while emergency medical personnel worked to clear the road.
Ofﬁ  cials also chased after 
several cows that escaped from the truck.
An ambulance took Carr to 
Shands at UF for treatment. 
His passenger, Bryan Martin, 
50, of Okeechobee, suffered minor injuries, according to the report.
For several hours, trafﬁ  c on 
I-75 slowed down.
At 12:30 p.m., Gainesville/
Alachua County Smarttrafﬁ  c reported that northbound trafﬁ  c was backed up about 9 miles south from the crash to Payne’s Prairie.
Southbound trafﬁ  c stretched 
12 miles past exit 400 in Alachua.
By 5 p.m., ofﬁ  cials reopened 
all southbound lanes after clearing the road and gathering all the escaped cattle with the exception of one animal.
It was shot after it became 
aggressive, according to published reports.

As classes start, a group of 
about 330 UF students will not 
only step into their ﬁ  rst college classrooms ever, they will make history for themselves and their school.
As part of a new program to 
boost enrollment and integrate entrepreneurship into traditional coursework, Innovation Acad-emy students will take on-campus classes Spring through Summer and enjoy “summer break” during the Fall semester, when they can take online courses, study abroad or do internships.
Students in the program can 
choose from seven colleges and about 29 majors — ranging from plant science to political science — but will all complete a base cur-riculum, which focuses on innova-tion and creativity skills that ap-ply in every ﬁ  eld.
In UF President Bernie Ma-
chen’s Friday morning address to welcome the Innovation Academy Class of 2016 to campus, he praised students for their participation in an unprecedented program.

UF students who need a ride after dark can 
now make a request with a new smartphone ap-
plication, SNAP UF.
The free app, which was released Dec. 6 by the 
Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol, shows where vans are in real time on a map and gives alerts when a van is approaching.
The app is available for download on iOS and 
Android platforms, said UPD ofﬁ  cer Gregory Cas-tronover, but students will not be able to make ride requests for a few weeks.
Castronover, who runs the day-to-day opera-tions of SNAP , said the GPS technology is still be-ing installed into SNAP vans.
The app is sponsored by UF Student Govern-
ment, Transportation and Parking Services and University Police.
Developing the app and its updates, which cost 
about $10,000, is funded by student parking tick-ets.
Student government agency Nightlife Naviga-
tors approached Totuit, a mobile platform devel-opment company based in UF’s Innovation Hub, with the idea of creating an app in summer 2012.
“It’s a responsibility we are giving students, 
that they should take advantage of their transpor-tation services,” said Cristian Arango, director of Nightlife Navigators and a 20-year-old history and political science junior. “It’s funded by stu-dents, for students.”
“We hope it’s gonna make it a lot easier for 
everybody — students and employees,” Castron-over said.

Cat that spent a week in Mass. 
tree foundMARION, Mass. — A stray cat 
that spent at least a week stuck in a Massachusetts tree before plunging 80 feet to the ground and fleeing has been found, and all things considered, appears to be in good health.
A Marion Animal Hospital 
veterinarian said Wednesday it’s “unbelievable” that the cat dubbed Fortunate has just a cou-ple of pulled muscles and a pos-sible parasitic infection.
The cat was spotted in a Roch-
ester, Mass., tree on Christmas Eve. Several rescue attempts failed before firefighters cut the branch it was perched on Sun-day. Cat shelter founder Pam Robinson finally trapped the skit-tish feline on Tuesday.
Robinson tells The Standard 
Times she will keep the cat for a few weeks so it can regain weight before putting it up for adoption.

Mass. cops caught egging su-
perior officer’s homeNEWTON, Mass. — Mas-
sachusetts police responding to reports of teenagers toss-ing eggs at a house last month got quite a surprise when they tracked down the suspects.
A department spokesman 
tells The MetroWest Daily News the three people who egged the house in Framing-ham early Dec. 11 were fellow law enforcement officers serv-ing with the Newton police. They were off duty at the time.
They told Framingham po-
lice the egging incident was “a prank, a joke between friends.”
The homeowner is a Newton 
police sergeant and their supe-rior officer. He says the matter is being handled internally.
No charges were filed, and 
the Newton officers were not publicly identified.

a personal friend of Albert the

He is owned and trained by Sarge Bannister, football team equipment manager. Sam sometimes gets leftover meat from the team. Rumor has it he can push a football with his nose for a touchdown.Jan. 8, 1975: A majority of 
UF professors sampled in a ran-dom telephone survey by the Alligator favor a return to the semester system in place of the quarter system. Professors from almost all of UF colleges said they would prefer going back to the semester system. Chem-istry professor Paul Tarrant was at UF when it had a semester system and said it should have never gone to quarters. “The student had a longer time to meditate and think about the material being presented him,” Tarrant said. 
Jan. 10, 2000: UF officials said 
they’re breathing a sigh of relief on a job well done after years of preparation for Y2K. Robin Mar -
rin, a UF computer applications coordinator, said most of the problems relating to a systems-wide computer crash are gone. Marin said the money spent on the project was beneficial. “Not one penny or one minute was wasted on Y2K preparations,”

� UF SOLD ABOUT 7,000 
STUDENT TICKETS.

NEW ORLEANS –– In a sea of 
red outside of the Mercedes-Benz 
Superdome, five Gators fans-started to chant, “It’s great to be a Florida Gator!”
Seconds later, University of 
Louisville fans drowned them out with their cheers, which had become common in New Orleans leading up to the Allstate Sugar Bowl.
Despite being outnumbered pri-
or to the game, 25-year-old Oviedo resident Kristyna Adams said she was confident Florida fans were ready to cheer on the Gators.
“I think that Gator fans showed 
up in abundance today,” Adams said. “Last night we were a mi-nority. But today, Gator fans have risen, and we’re here to cheer.”
More fans may have showed 
up on the day of the game, but it wasn’t enough.
The university sold about 7,000 
of its allotted 17,500 tickets. 
The total attendance on Wednes-
day was 54,178 — the lowest Sugar Bowl attendance since 1939.
Some thought the high cost of 
the tickets deterred students from making the trip. The university sold tickets for $102 to its students — only about $50 cheaper than general public tickets.
“It shocked me how expensive 
it was for students,” said 21-year-old biology junior Cole McCarty.
Still, others said that Louisville 
fans outnumbered Florida fans be-cause the Sugar Bowl isn’t viewed as a big game to them anymore. 
This was the Gators’ ninth Sug-
ar Bowl and the Cardinals’ first.
“With the Gator fans’ strong 
history, this isn’t enough for them anymore,” 56-year-old University of Louisville alumni Charles Lang said before the game. “They want-ed to be in the national champion-ship and playing a bigger team. Stranger things have happened, but if we were to upset Florida, that’d mean a big deal to us.”

University of Louisville alumnia wise choice for students because it ad-
dresses the student debt problem. It offers flexible scholarship payment options and leverages the rising popularity of online education. It also makes room for quali-fied students to attend UF who otherwise would have been turned away because of limited Fall classroom space, he said.
Many of the classes offered teach en-
trepreneurial skills to encourage students to start their own companies or be more innovative in their fields. The program al-lows students to dedicate their entire Fall semester to gaining experience, at a time when most students their age can’t be-cause they are in classes.
However, students have complained 
that when they applied to UF, they had an option to say whether they were interested in the Innovation Academy.
 Many who selected “yes” said they felt 
they were then automatically placed in the program without actually wanting to be in it.
Jessie White, 25, the student resource 
specialist graduate assistant for the pro-gram, said that was not the case. Each stu-dent chose to be there.
“There were a few challenges when 
building the program, and we are address-ing each one,” White said. “The main chal-lenge is getting the students to understand the program and the Spring/Summer schedule.”
Another complaint among students 
is that there are not many majors or col-leges to choose from. White said they are working on adding more majors for future classes.
A further concern is that students can’t 
participate in many of the Fall activities, the major one of those being football. However, White says that is not true.
“That is actually a misconception. After 
their first semester as a student, Innova-tion Academy students can come to foot-ball games,” she said. In Fall 2013, all of these students can attend the games with a valid student ID and ticket.
Innovation Academy students were not 
eligible to participate in this past season’s student ticket lottery because they weren’t registered students until this Spring.
Despite some students’ complaints, 
there are many who want to be in the pro-gram or who look forward to its benefits.
“I chose the Innovation Academy be-
cause it’s different,” said 19-year-old an-thropology freshman Marielis Nieves. “It offered me opportunities other students don’t get, like during the Fall, I can do in-ternships or study abroad.”
Many parents are also excited their stu-
dents are participating in the program.
Arlene Nieves, 45, and Henry Nieves, 47, are particularly proud of their daugh-ter, Marielis, who will be one of the first students to ever graduate from this pro-gram. Arlene Nieves, aGeorgia Bulldogs fan, is even becoming 
a Gator for her daughter.
“After all,” she said, “she is making his-
tory.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 2013

UF’s chapter of the Sigma Phi Epsi-
lon fraternity — often called “Sig Ep” 
— was closed last month.
The fraternity’s national board of 
directors withdrew the charter of the Florida Alpha chapter, according to a Dec. 10 statement from executive di-rector Brian C. Warren Jr.
“The University of Florida is inves-
tigating the chapter for numerous vio-lations of the University’s code of con-duct,” Warren said in the statement.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said 
the chapter’s closing was not the result of a single incident. There are multiple charges pending, she said, including hazing.
Sikes provided a statement that de-clared the university’s support of the board’s decision.
“We understand it was a difficult 
one to make and look forward to the fraternity returning at some point in the future,” the statement read.
UF’s Sig Ep membership numbers 
have fluctuated over the past year, ac-cording to the chapter’s now-removed Manpower page on the national web-site. In Spring 2012, the fraternity had 141 members total, but started Fall with 57.
“When the cultural issues within a 
chapter conflict with our values and are too deeply rooted to effect change, we have no other option but to with-draw the chapter’s charter,” Warren said.

Florida universities across the state have 
launched an initiative to show that the state 
university system is a priority.
Aim Higher is a statewide initiative by uni-
versity students to raise awareness of the posi-tive impact increased funding has for higher education in Florida.
Student Body President Tj Villamil said the 
initiative is already on its way to making the state understand the importance of higher edu-cation.
In early December, he was in Tallahassee 
with other university student leaders and pres-idents. The group presented a plan to the state legislature, asking them for $118 million in ex-change for no tuition increases this year.
“The universities have never been this unit-
ed,” he said.
Gov . Rick Scott issued a statement after the presentation, applauding the universities’ posi-tion on not increasing tuition.
“We know Florida families want the best 
value possible from our higher education sys-tem, which means we have to make advanced degrees more affordable and more connected to students’ ability to get a great job when they graduate,” Scott said. “ We are pleased to share this important goal with many of Florida’s fin-est higher education leaders who are commit-ted to holding the line on tuition. We look for -
ward to working closely with them as we put together a proposed budget and other policies for the upcoming legislative session.”
Villamil said this is part of the action. In the 
meantime, he said, Aim Higher will have a ral-ly on Turlington Plaza in the next week to raise awareness about it on UF’s campus.
“We’re an investment, not an expense,” Vil-
lamil said.

KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Writer
As Alachua County students re-
sumed classes Thursday, city and 
county law enforcement agencies began stationing officers at local el-ementary schools to provide extra security for the new year.
The additional staffing was in 
response to concerns surrounding the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn., which left 26 people dead.
Gainesville Police added officers 
to 12 elementary schools across the city, said GPD spokesman Ben To-bias.
Tobias said GPD wants to keep 
officers at the schools for at least six weeks, but that will depend on funding and the number of officers available to work.
During that time, Gainesville 
Police will staff schools with uni-formed officers through temporary or overtime reassignments, Tobias said.
“It’s one of those balancing acts,” 
he said, adding that staffing officers could strain other areas of the de-partment.
The addition of 12 officers 
would be a 4 percent increase to the 300-member police force, which would cost GPD about $1 million per year, Tobias said.“In a perfect world, where fund-
ing isn’t even an issue, this is what we’d like to do,” he said. “But that’s a huge, huge number for us.”
In a similar move, the Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Office also sta-tioned deputies at 12 elementary schools across the county Thursday, according to an ASO news release.
The sheriff’s office has uniformed 
officers at the following elementary schools: Alachua, Archer, Chiles, Hidden Oak, Idylwild, Irby, Lake Forest, Meadowbrook, Newberry, Shell, Waldo and Wiles.
The staffing will be funded 
through the sheriff office’s current budget.
Representatives from GPD, 
ASO, Alachua Police, High Springs Police and other local law enforce-ment agencies formed a joint work group with Alachua County Public Schools to create a more long-term solution, according to an Alachua County Public Schools press re-lease.
The school district said the group 
will also work with local mental health experts to seek more state support for mental health services.
Tobias said he hopes the tem-
porary plan to station officers in elementary schools will turn into a permanent solution.
GPD Chief Tony Jones said his 
department is committed to stu-dents’ safety.
“Protecting these children needs 
to be our top priority ,” he said in a statement. “They are our most vul-nerable citizens.”

Spats with loved ones and dramatic relationships.
Sound familiar?
It’s the basic skeleton of any episode of “Downton Abbey,” 
but they’re also signs of a new semester.
Welcome to the Spring semester of 2013. It’s going to be a 
doozy.
It may not be as fancy as life at Downton, and you may not 
drink as much tea, but it will rival the series in drama and hard 
work. Please don’t worry . Because this piece contains no spoilers for the third season of “Downton,” which only just started airing here in the United States.
Take the “upstairs,” the family . You have the Dowager 
Countess making demands and funny quips. She sounds like everyone’s mom or grandmother, especially when big exams roll around. You want to please them, but you also totally know better. Get used to it.
Also, you don’t know better. There’s Mary and Matthew, on-again, off-again lovers who 
ﬁ  nally seem to have settled down long enough to get serious. They’re the Ross and Rachel of 1920. They’re also exactly like those two people in your group of friends who can’t decide if they’re in a relationship or not, or if they’re on a break. Get used to it.
Lady Sybil, the younger daughter at Downton, wants to wear 
pants! That’s a new idea back then. These days, we’re lucky to see a celebrity wearing pants at all. Sybil’s a pretty progressive lady for her time, so follow her example and make some daring wardrobe choices of your own.
Don’t forget about Edith, the one sister at Downton who just 
can’t seem to ﬁ  nd a man. Let’s not talk about her because we’ll just start to pity her and no woman wants that. She’s plucky enough that she’ll pick herself up by her bootstraps.
Then there’s the “downstairs” crew: a whole host of people 
who cook and clean all day.
Take Mrs. Patmore, for example. She’s a tough lady who 
takes no funny business. Let’s all try to be like her during this semester. But maybe be a little more understanding than she can be at times.
Don’t be like Thomas. Now, he’s a pretty misunderstood 
character, but he has a very mean streak in him. He’s the same as O’Brien, a woman who will stoop to low places to get back at people and get whatever she wants.
Instead, be like Branson, the handsome and charming chauf-
feur — who also happens to be a socialist. We’re not saying to become socialists, so put your email urge away . He’s just a man who knows what he wants and to be treated fairly.
Start this new semester with your best foot forward. That’s all 
we’re trying to say.
The characters on “Downton Abbey” go through a ton of 
emotional turmoil in nearly every episode. They literally go through war. So, with the new season coming to America this week, take it to heart.
It’s a metaphor for your own life, even though the series takes 
place a hundred years ago. If they can make it through World War I, you can make it through the Spring semester at UF.
Welcome back. Welcome home.Elegy of an apocalypse: A high school tale
Well, the world didn’t end like the Mayans said it would. It’s good news for us as a human race, but it’s pretty bad news for the betting ticket I had 
— $500 on 10,000-1 odds that the Mayan prediction would come true.
Oh, well. I hadn’t quite ﬁ  gured out where I was gonna 
cash it in anyway . Or what I would have spent my winnings on. It’s a funny story how I got that ticket, though.
It was back in 2007.I was 16, even more foolish than I am now and at a Fel-
lowship of Christian Athletes morning meeting.
They had a projector in the high school auditorium with 
the lights turned off.  While everyone else was making out, I watched a YouTube video on the big screen.
It started off normal: hellﬁ  re, brimstone, apocalypse.Then they dropped the Mayan knowledge bomb on us 
— a bunch of high schoolers, the children of the ‘90s who didn’t become skeptical until later thanks to MythBusters and snopes.com.
I grabbed a doughnut as I walked out of the meeting, feel-
ing woozy , as if I’d just given blood. I snacked slowly and slipped outside to catch some fresh air before my ﬁ  rst class.
There was a guy out there. Scraggly, lost, scary.All beard and no face.“Is this 2007?” he shouted at me.I think I nodded. I was almost scared enough to go back 
inside.
He started toward me, waving a small ticket angrily in 
my face. He said he was from the future, from January of 2013, and he hadn’t liked the post-Mayan apocalypse world as much as he thought he would.
He had stocked up on all kind of weapons and storage 
items to keep himself alive in the event of apocalypse. He’d even gone out to a very sketchy bookie and laid money on the world ending that day; the bookie gave him 10,000-1 odds after he promised to put $500 on it.
Then they took his money and laughed. The day came. 
He walked around with ears pricked, listening for a humon-gous “boom” or even a teeny one. Nothing.
He lay in bed all night like a kid waiting for Santa Claus, but not a creature stirred, not even Zipacna, the son of Seven Macaw, to unleash vicious earthquakes on the Earth.
He said he was very depressed 
the next few weeks.
I really had no desire to hear 
about his emotional problems, so I cut him off and challenged him to prove he was from the future.
“How?” he asked.“Tell me who’s No. 1 in college basketball.”“It’s Duke. They’ve got a really good white guy.”“That’s actually pretty believable. Tell me something I 
won’t believe.”
Then he told me some of the most bald-faced, ridiculous 
lies I’d ever heard.
First, he said Barack Obama was elected to his second 
term, but Hillary Clinton was leaving her post as secretary of state. Then he told me about a couple with some K-heavy names that I didn’t recognize who would be all over the news: this rich girl with a sex tape and a reality show and Jay-Z’s beat-maker. Supposedly they would be having a baby to-gether, and this would somehow be a big story.
He offered me the ticket.“I’ll give it to you for 10 bucks, kid, I just need some 
food.”
Of course, I didn’t believe him about being from the fu-
ture, but the ticket was real-looking enough.
I thought his predictions were funny, though, so I asked 
him what would happen to Florida football after the world didn’t end.
He said Tebow would be in the NFL backing up Greg 
McElroy and Mark Sanchez, and the Gators would lose their bowl game to Louisville.
That was the ﬁ  nal straw. I thanked him for his advice and 
then bought the ticket. Happy 2013, everybody.

Magic, a Gentle Carousel mini horse of High Springs, comforts a Newtown, Conn., 
girl at a memorial site in the town. Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses is visiting the Newtown community to aid in the healing process.
JEWEL MIDELIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
As the people of New-
town, Conn., attempt to move 
forward following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, three special guests from High Springs traveled more than 1,000 miles to com-fort the saddened souls.
Magic, Wakanda and Alad-
din — three blue-eyed, minia-ture horses from Gentle Carou-sel Miniature Therapy Horses — traveled with organization founders and volunteers to help comfort Newtown resi-dents.
Debbie Garcia-Bengochea, 
co-founder of Gentle Carousel, said she received phone calls from victims’ families asking the organization to bring its miniature horses to the town.
Garcia-Bengochea said the 
organization decided to make the trip north after a parent told them, “We want our chil-dren to dream of minis, not monsters.”
For the past week, the 
2-foot-tall horses have had pri-vate meetings with school sur -vivors, families, first respond-ers and community members.
Garcia-Bengochea said the 
Dec.14 school shooting, which left 20 students and six adults dead, has affected everyone in the town.
“It is a very intense situa-
tion to be here and be part of this,” she said. “Everyone han-dles things differently, but it’s a very sad time.”
Garcia-Bengochea said the 
town specifically requested Magic, a jet-black horse with a white face.
She described the reaction 
of the Newtown children, say-ing they wanted to be sprinkled with Magic’s “fairy dust” after they saw the sparkles shining from the horse’s hair.
On Saturday, more than 600 
people gathered at the town’s library to meet the three mini horses, Garcia-Bengochea said.
“The outpouring of people 
that want to be with the horses was amazing,” she said.
After requests from resi-
dents to extend their visit, Gentle Carousel plans to stay an extra week in town.Although the trip has been 
a financial challenge, Garcia-Bengochea said donations from around the world helped make the trip possible for the horses.
She said a medical volun-
teer from Maryland brought a heated horse ambulance to Newtown so the horses could stay warm at night. A horse training facility near the town also offered an indoor arena for the trio to relax in, as well as pastures for them to run around in after work.
Today, Garcia-Bengochea 
and the horses will go to other schools in the Newtown area in hopes of comforting chil-dren and school staff.
Garcia-Bengochea said 
the organization will name its newest therapy horse after one of the Sandy Hook Ele-mentary students who passed away during the shooting. The child’s family will follow the horse’s two-year training pro-cess.
Garcia-Bengochea said she 
hopes Gentle Carousel can return to Newtown this sum-mer.
“When you see the things 
we’ve seen, we absolutely feel like we wouldn’t want to be anywhere else,” she said.

Kate Lambert stooped over an 
open freezer chest, pulling out 
boxes of Lime Fruit Floes to fill her shopping basket.
Since Lambert served the fro-
zen treat instead of wedding cake on her special day three years ago, she hasn’t been able to find the specialty item until the opening day of Gainesville’s first  Trader Joe’s grocery store Dec. 12.
“They taste like little marga-
ritas and heaven,” she said. “I’ve missed these for three years.”
The opening of Trader Joe’s 
grocery store in Butler Plaza — the second Florida location of the California-based chain — ex-panded specialty food options for Gainesville residents.
In spite of the rain on open-
ing day, an arch of orange and blue balloons greeted the steady stream of customers who flooded the crosswalk and held up traffic in front of the store.
The checkout lines at each of 
the eight registers stretched more than seven customers long, chok-ing nearby aisles.
“It’s been like this all day, even 
with the rain,” said employee Liz Lockwood, 27. “The locals — it don’t bother them.”
Lockwood, a Trader Joe’s crew 
member, said 127 people waited to crowd into the store at the 8 a.m. opening. By 9 a.m., 600 people had walked through the doors.
Vinnie Athey, a 25-year-old 
intern with Reformed University Fellowship, said he went to the store and expected a spectacle similar to Walmart during Black Friday. He said the atmosphere was lively but more civil than he expected.
“We were really just coming for 
the festivities,” Athey said. “What we got was an island adventure.”
The business Trader Joe’s has 
been enjoying seems to be trick-ling into neighboring stores in the plaza, said PetSmart operations manager RaeAnna Thornton.
Thornton said the pet store has 
seen more foot traffic in the last month since Trader Joe’s moved into the space next door.
“It’s ridiculous how many 
Trader Joe’s bags come in here and how many Trader Joe’s carts wan-der around,” she said.
That’s partly because the two 
markets are related, Thornton said.
“The kind of people who tend 
to shop at Trader Joe’s tend to shop here,” she said. “If you’re likely to care about the quality of your food, you’ll also care about catering to the needs of your pet.”
Because Trader Joe’s opened 
after many students left town for Winter Break, Store Manager Jodi McCullough said employ-ees became familiar with many of Gainesville’s permanent resi-dents.
“The last two weeks have been 
a great opportunity to meet the folks that live here all year round, for locals to come in and check out the store,” she said.
So far, McCullough said, orange 
chicken, the 99-cent handmade Italian pasta, Green Plant juice and the whole selection of Indian food have been best sellers.  “This is a town of foodies in 
Gainesville, and I think we’ve tapped into that market well,” she said. “I think this is a really great addition to the grocery land-scape.”10, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 2013

A Gainesville man was arrested Saturday 
night on charges of chasing another man 
with a samurai sword and resisting arrest.
The incident started just after 10 p.m. 
Saturday when Robert Chesser, 46, of 635 SW 11th Place, started to argue with the vic-tim, according to a GPD arrest report.
Witnesses told police they saw Chesser 
run into his apartment, come out with a 3-foot long samurai sword and chase the man, swinging the sword at him.
When police arrived, Chesser ignored 
officers’ orders to remain outside and went back into his apartment.  
Outside, Chesser’s wife told police that 
Chesser had  “access to numerous swords and other bladed weapons,” according to the report.
Officers approached the apartment and 
talked to Chesser through his front door, asking him to come out.
Chesser then charged at police with a 
mop, yelling “I will f****** kill you,” accord-ing to the report.
A K-9 unit officer released K-9 Nero into 
the house to subdue him, but Chesser struck the dog with the mop handle.
Officers then went into the house and 
used a Taser to subdue and arrest Chesser.
Police charged Chesser with aggravat-
ed assault, two counts of assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting an officer without violence, resisting an officer with violence, and striking or interfering with a police animal, according to the report.
GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said Chess-
er was diagnosed with 
several mental disorders and is on psychotropic medications.
Police booked Chesser 
into the Alachua County Jail at 11:18 p.m. Satur -
day, where he remained Sunday with a $30,000 bond.
Tobias said Nero and the officers were 
not injured during the incident.
“This incident could have ended a lot 
worse,” he said. “We are happy that officers were able to subdue Chesser before he was able to seriously injure or kill anyone.”

The UF Lastinger Center for Learning 
and Study Edge partnered to develop a free 
program to serve as a study aid for middle and high school students taking the Alge-bra 1 End-of-Course Assessment.
Algebra Nation launches Jan. 15. Stu-
dents will have access to study guides and video review sessions that will cover topics on the assessment.
Students will also have access to a study 
wall where they can post questions for ex-perts or other students to answer. The pro-gram will also schedule tutoring sessions, especially as the date of the assessment gets closer, said Donald Pemberton, direc-tor of the Lastinger Center for Learning.In 2012, more than 40 percent of middle 
and high school students failed the assess-ment, which began in 2011, said Study Edge president Ethan Fieldman.
Students who fail the assessment have 
to retake the test and pass it in order to re-ceive credit for the class.
The program will be accessible through 
the Algebra Nation website and through a mobile device application for iPhones, An-droids and tablets. Students can register on the website now to receive updates.
The review videos were created by 
teachers from school districts around Flor -
ida who have helped their students score high on the assessment, Pemberton said.
The Lastinger Center for Learning and 
Study Edge worked closely with the Flor -
ida Department of Education to develop this program.
Next school year, the program will also 
cover the biology and geometry assess-ments, which started in 2012.Program aims to prepare

The rescue team wanted to name the par-
alyzed dachshund given a second chance 
days before Christmas “St. Nick.” Instead, the dog — once scheduled for euthaniza-tion, now living with a foster family in Gainesville — was dubbed “Vixen.”
The 4-year-old female wiener dog was 
suffering from intervertebral disc disease, a neurological problem affecting the spine, when she was dropped off at Miami-Dade Animal Services on Dec. 21.
She was unable to walk and was sched-
uled to be put down at noon the next day, said Steven Spierer, a board member of the Dachshund Rescue South Florida organiza-tion.
The afternoon Vixen was dropped off, a 
staff member contacted Dachshund Rescue South Florida.
The organization does not accept dogs 
with Vixen’s disease because of the difficul-ty of finding them homes. The cost of sur -
gery and recovery can run up to more than $5,000, Spierer said. But the organization still wanted to help.
As soon as it heard about Vixen, Dachs-
hund Rescue South Florida posted about her on its Facebook page.
Shortly after, they got a response from 
Carrie Santare, a neurology resident at UF’s College of Veterinary Medicine.According to an email from Sarah Carey, 
the director of Public Relations at the col-lege, Santare offered to foster Vixen — if she had feeling in her legs.
If a dog with her disease can feel its legs, 
it has an 80 to 90 percent chance of recover-ing enough to walk.
Santare agreed to foster Vixen.A group of seven people relayed Vixen 
from South Florida to Gainesville that same night. Vixen traveled for about six hours, and Santare drove an hour and a half south of Gainesville to pick her up.
“It’s remarkable what can be done when 
just normal people work together for a cause,” Spierer said.
Within the next couple of days, it was de-
termined that Vixen’s disease was caused by a ruptured
intervertebral disc. A donor provided fi-
nancial assistance, Carey said.
On Dec. 24, Vixen had an emergency sur-
gery to decompress her spinal cord.
On Christmas morning, Vixen went home 
with Santare.
On Dec. 26, she was walking with a wob-
ble.
“I have fallen in love with her, but she 
needs a forever home,” Santare said. “She is great with my two boxers and the cat. She has a heart of gold and will make someone extremely happy. She is my Christmas mir-acle.”12, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 2013

Two UF students mapped out 
the entire world in 14 hours.
Joseph Murphy and Chad 
Juehring won the world’s largest 
student data visualization compe-tition for their program, “Six De-grees of Transportation.”
Murphy , a 27-year-old first-year 
student in a UF’s Digital Worlds Institute’s masters program, com-peted in the Interactive Challenge at the Visualizing Global Marathon with Juehring, a 30-year-old in his second year of  the same program.
Of the 1,017 students scattered 
across 38 countries and 176 univer -
sities, “Six Degrees of Transporta-tion” was chosen as one of the best interactive projects submitted on-line for the 2012 competition.
In the competition, students 
had 48 hours to tackle one of three data-visualizing challenges. The three options were Disease Alerts, Global Flights Network and U.S. Election in Social Media.
Murphy and Juehring chose the 
Global Flights Network challenge, which had nine other entries.
Contestants were asked to look 
at the intricate network of flight patterns worldwide and visual-ize them in a new way . Murphy said their interactive design mim-ics a solar system and measures in number of flights rather than in distance.
“Our perspective was to look at 
it not as a network looking down at Earth, but thinking of it as a sin-gle person,” Murphy said.
“Six Degrees of Transporta-
tion” has dozens of colored circles that represent airports all over the world. A person can choose an air -
port, and the program will show six different flights to get to the fi-nal destination.
“I would never plan my travel 
using it, but it is fun to play with,” Murphy said.
During the 14 hours it took to 
program, Murphy and Juehring took turns sleeping and had data running on five different comput-ers. For their design, they won $2,500, which they will split.
“For me it was about having a 
good portfolio piece, whether we won or not,” he said. “Winning was a good bonus, though.”
James Oliverio, director of the 
Digital Works Institute, wrote in an email that he was proud of Murphy and Juehring’s work.
“Their intuitive interaction de-
sign and solid technical prowess are clearly exemplified in not only this project, but in their ongoing work in Digital Worlds’ classes,” he said.

A Pinellas Park woman was 
arrested Dec. 27 in connection 
with two Walmart robberies in Gainesville.
Gainesville Police officers ar -
rested Regina Mary Rossi, 52, and charged her with two counts of robbery with a firearm, which is a first-degree felony, accord-ing to a GPD arrest report.
At about 3 p.m. on Black Fri-
day, Rossi walked into the Wal-mart on Northeast 12th Avenue wearing a snow cap with a black wig.
Once inside, she walked 
around the store and put toys and a poinsettia into her cart. Then she approached a garden center cashier, according to the report.
Rossi pulled out a black 
handgun, pointed it at the ca-shier and ordered the woman to fill a bag with money.
When the cashier said she 
couldn’t open the register, Rossi removed a toy jewelry box from her cart and asked the woman to ring up the item and give her cash.
Rossi stole more than $700 
from the cashier and fled the store, according to the report.
GPD officers responded to 
the scene, where a K-9 unit of-ficer and a police dog tracked Rossi’s trail.
Police later found a shirt, 
blue jeans, cap and boots that Rossi wore during the time of the robbery, according to the report.A detective from Gainesville 
Police’s Forensic Crime Unit found Rossi’s fingerprints on the toys, the counter inside the store and on the cart she used.
On Dec. 26, Rossi walked 
into the Walmart on Northwest 13th Street. This time, she did not wear a disguise.
She walked around the store 
again, putting toys into her cart.
Rossi approached a cashier 
in the store’s garden center.
As the cashier rang up and 
bagged the toys in Rossi’s cart, Rossi told the clerk she had a 
gun in her purse and de-manded all money in the register, ac-cording to the report.
The cashier 
gave Rossi the cash and the 
bag of toys. Rossi later fled from the store westbound toward Bank of America, in the 2700 block of Northwest 13th Street.
Police did not say how much 
money was stolen.
The store’s surveillance cam-
eras captured Rossi robbing the clerk and fleeing from the scene.
The next day, using the fin-
gerprint evidence, detectives obtained a photograph of Rossi, according to the report.
During an interview, inves-
tigators presented a photo of Rossi to one of the Walmart ca-shiers, who identified Rossi as the alleged robber.Later that evening, officers 
located and arrested Rossi out-side her sister’s house in Fort White.
During questioning, Rossi 
told police she robbed the Wal-mart stores because she lost cus-tody of her son five years ago and that her house was being foreclosed on, according to the report.
After her arrest, officers 
booked Rossi into the Columbia County Jail. She was later taken to the the Alachua County Jail.
Meanwhile, Rossi’s car was 
towed to University Towing in Gainesville.
Inside the car, police found a 
black Taurus .38-caliber hand-gun as well as ammunition. They also found a bag of toys, a receipt and sunglasses Rossi wore during one of the robber -
ies.
Officers booked Rossi into 
the Alachua County Jail at 11:44 a.m. Dec. 30. As of Sunday night, she remained in custody with a $200,000 bond.
Gainesville Police’s crime an-
alysts sent out Rossi’s informa-tion to other law enforcement agencies in the state to see if she could be connected to any other unsolved robberies, said GPD spokesman Ben Tobias.
As of Friday, he said, Rossi 
may be connected to at least two other robberies, one of which happened in Pinellas County.
Tobias could not give any 
more details on the other inci-dents.

A Gainesville man arrested in October 
accused of importing stolen dinosaur fossils 
from Asia plead guilty before a New York judge on Dec. 27.
As part of his plea, Eric Prokopi agreed 
to forfeit a 70-million-year-old Tyrannosau-rus bataar skeleton he allegedly stole from Mongolia and sold for about $1 million, ac-cording to the U.S. State Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.
Prokopi, a 38-year-old Gainesville resi-
dent and self-described “commercial pale-ontologist,” will also give up two additional Tyrannosaurus bataar skeletons, as well as Sauolophus and Oviraptor fossils.
Prokopi was charged with conspiracy 
to smuggle illegal goods, entry of goods by means of false statements and interstate and foreign transport of goods converted and taken by fraud. If convicted, he faces a total of 17 years in prison for the charges, accord-ing to State Attorney’s Office news release.
“Fossils and ancient skeletal remains are 
part of the fabric of a country’s natural his-tory and cultural heritage, and black mar -
keteers like Prokopi, who illegally export and sell these wonders, steal a slice of that history,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara wrote in a statement.
From 2010 to 2012, Prokopi allegedly 
stole dinosaur skeletons from Mongolia and imported them into the U.S. He is also accused of providing U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials false information about the fossils’ origin, value and identity.
Early last year, Prokopi listed a Tyranno-
saurus bataar skeleton for auction through Heritage Auctions, an auctioning website. On May 20, an anonymous buyer from Manhattan bought the fossil for about $1 million dollars. The next day, U.S. govern-ment officials seized the skeleton at the re-quest of the Mongolian government.
That same month, Prokopi also sold the 
remains of a Saurolophus angustirostris, a dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period, for $75,000 to I.M. Chait, an auction house located in Beverly Hills.
In October, agents from the U.S. Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations arrested Prokopi at his house on the 5900 block of Southwest 13th Street.
A New York judge will sentence Proko-
pi on April 25. With Prokopi’s guilty plea, Bharara praised investigators for their work in the case.
“We are pleased that we can now begin 
the process of returning these prehistoric fossils to their countries of origin,” he said.

They are at security check-
points in airports all over the 
world.
Large full-body scanners 
give Transportation Security Administration officials a glimpse into what we’re hid-ing in our pockets.
These machines, used to 
prevent passengers from bringing dangerous items into terminals and onto air -
planes, have now made their way into county jails across the state.
At the Alachua County 
Jail, deputies recently started using a RadPRO SecurPASS scanner to screen criminals for any contraband before booking them into the jail.
“Security is enhanced by 
ensuring tools and/or weap-ons are not introduced into the facility by prisoners/inmates,” wrote Capt. Jeff Cloutier, ASO Security Oper -
ations Division Commander at the jail, in an email.
The Alachua County Sher -
iff’s Office purchased the machine in September from Canon U.S.A. Inc., the same company that manufactures cameras and printers, for $200,000.
The money came from 
confiscated drug money and funds from unfilled positions within the sheriff’s office, ac-cording to an ASO news re-lease.
The sheriff’s office now 
joins Marion, Indian River, Polk, St. Lucie, Palm Beach and Pasco county sheriff’s of-fices in using full body scan-ners in their jails, Cloutier said.
With the new machine, of-
ficials have reduced the time to search an inmate if they believe he or she is trying to sneak illegal items into the jail.
A traditional strip search 
requires several deputies and could take 15 minutes to complete, said ASO spokes-man Lt. Todd Kelly. 
Jail officials can now 
screen an inmate for contra-band in seconds.Here’s how it works: An inmate steps onto a 
platform and is moved across a gate that shoots an X-ray beam, which takes a digi-tal X-ray of the inmate from head to toe.
After a few seconds, the 
scanner produces a detailed image of the inmate’s body, and the picture is sent to a computer, where a jail official checks to see if the scanner located any hidden items.
The machine can detect 
weapons, drugs, chemical and biological materials, and items as small as a needle, according to the SecurPASS website.
If the machine detects any 
hidden items, officials con-duct a strip search and con-fiscate the contraband from the inmate.
During a testing session 
Dec. 11, jail officials found a handcuff key hidden inside an inmate’s rectum, an item that would have gone unno-ticed without the machine, Kelly said.
Along with keeping illegal 
items out of the jail, Sheriff Sadie Darnell said the ma-chine would help improve work security.
“We are committed to 
providing a safe environ-ment for employees at the jail and want criminals to know that the Alachua County Jail is not where you want to try to smuggle contraband,” she said.

La Lola Loca, the Latin food truck that 
rolled onto campus last Fall, is back this 
semester.
New additions on the menu include 
nachos, black bean tacos and burritos, plus quesadillas. Chips and queso will replace chips with queso.
The food truck will be open from 11 a.m. 
to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on the North Lawn of the Reitz Union. 
Last semester, it traveled to locations like 
Century Tower and Library West.
Food items are less than $10, according 
to the La Lola Loca UF Facebook page. Cus-tomers can pay with Flex Bucks and Declin-ing Balances on their Gator 1 Cards, as well as cash and credit cards.
Marketing program manager for Gator 
Dining Services Jill Rodriguez wrote in an email that La Lola Loca will be on campus indefinitely , and no additional food trucks will be added this semester.
“La Lola Loca was well-received by both 
students and faculty,” Rodriguez wrote.
Twenty-two-year-old chemical engineer -
ing senior Tim Heneks said he likes to order the Tacodilla.
“La Lola Loca combines everything I love 
about about Mexican [food],” he said.

At Chuy’s, the king of rock ‘n’ 
roll never left the building, espe-
cially not before his birthday.
The Tex-Mex restaurant chain 
will celebrate Elvis Presley’s 78th birthday Tuesday by giving free entrees to anyone who dresses up as the American icon or his wife, Priscilla, according to a company press release.
Customers who attend the Jail-
house Rock-themed event will re-ceive special pricing throughout the day on entrees named after Presley, which include Elvis Green Chile Fried Chicken and the Elvis Presley Memorial Combo, said Ray Gross, kitchen manager for the Gainesville Chuy’s restaurant, located on Southwest Archer Road.
The restaurant typically serves 
15 to 20 Elvis entrees daily, said Gross, 24.
“People don’t order Elvis plates 
much because they’re not aware of them, but I anticipate an increase,” he said. “People who don’t drink Corona drink it on Cinco de Mayo, and it’s the same thing here.”
With the purchase of a Blue 
Hawaiian, Presley’s favorite drink, or a margarita, guests will receive prizes such as guitar picks, a spe-cial souvenir cup and a jailhouse temporary tattoo, according to the release.
Customers will also be able to 
purchase T-shirts of Presley and his wife, which were made for the oc-casion.
Chuy’s, which first opened in 
Austin, Texas, in 1982, has been cel-ebrating Presley’s birthday since its founding.
Tyler Francischine, a 23-year-old 
UF graduate and server at the res-taurant, said she looks forward to seeing customers dress up in Pres-ley paraphernalia.
“I’m hoping to see some babies 
dressed as Elvis,” she said.
Eric Simanton, manager and 
spokesman for the Gainesville res-taurant, said each Chuy’s restau-rant has an “Elvis shrine,” which is used for customers to dedicate their Presley memorabilia.
Simanton said he hopes Pres-
ley’s birthday bash will inspire customers to feel like family at the restaurant.
“Elvis reached so many people 
in his era, so we’re big on the fact that Elvis is very real, very iconic and very clean, just like our restau-rant,” Simanton said.Chuy’s to

Gainesville residents did 
not get to enjoy a white Christ-
mas after all.
After the anticipated ice rink 
slated to occupy Bo Diddley Community Plaza was delayed from opening several times, it was finally canceled after tech-nical challenges.
The obstacles included sev-
eral unsuccessful repairs to the chiller lines intended to freeze the ice and problems with fitting the ice rink on the plaza, said city spokesman Bob Woods.
Issues with setting up the 
35-foot tent designed to cover the ice also interfered with the project, according to Alligator archives.
Russell Etling, programs 
coordinator for the city of Gainesville, said Midwest Dis-play decided to nix the rink because the delays pushed the opening too far into the win-dow between Thanksgiving and the holiday season, when the company was counting on the most ticket sales.
Etling said the city will look 
into offering an ice rink next winter.
“We do our homework and 
felt comfortable with [Mid-west Display’s] capabilities,” he said. 
“I truly believe there were 
forces beyond anyone’s con-trol. Sometimes technical chal-lenges happen.”
Midwest Display repre-
sentatives were unable to be reached for comment.
Ruby Mendez, a 19-year-
old nursing freshman, said the rink’s cancellation was a dis-appointing loss.
“I don’t think it’s fair for 
them to tell us they’re going to bring it and then take it away,” she said.MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 17

Freshman Tyler Dwyer doesn’t 
have to feel guilty about spending 
money on his usual beef and rice burrito at Moe’s Southwest Grill any-more.
With the start of a new semester, 
Moe’s and Chomp It have been added to the Gator Dining meal plan.
The two restaurants in the Racquet 
Club Dining Center were added to provide meal plan destinations close to the Murphree Area, marketing pro-gram manager for Gator Dining Ser -
vices Jill Rodriguez wrote in an email.
Rodriguez said this was a good 
thing for students because it has in-creased the number of restaurants that accept meal plan dollars to eight.
Dwyer agrees. “I’m happy about it because it 
gives me more options that are basi-cally free to eat,” said the 18-year-old international studies student.
Other changes to Gator Dining 
include renovating the Fresh Food Company and adding a Provisions on Demand Market to the Rawlings bus stop after Spring Break.

� PEOPLE CAN TEXT CRIME 
TIPS AND RECEIVE ALERTS.
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Writer
Communicating with Gainesville Po-
lice is now as simple as sending a text.
TipSoft software, available through 
police technology company PublicEn-
gines, allows users to send anonymous crime tips and receive activity alerts via text message, email and a smartphone application.
Gainesville residents and UF stu-
dents can now text tips to “CRIMES” (274637) using the keyword GPDFL or submit through the company’s TipSub-mit Mobile application, according to a GPD news release. Both methods will protect users’ identities on all anony-mous tips.
“When you have the ability to send 
a text message, it’s a lot less intrusive to the person who’s reporting the crime,” said GPD spokesman Ben Tobias.
Another feature of the software, Tip-
Soft Alerts, allows Gainesville Police to text and/or email crime activity alerts to the public, similar to the UF Alerts system.
“We’re trying to figure out more 
ways to reach more people in the com-munity,” Tobias said.
Both TipSoft and TipSoft Alerts al-
low users to anonymously respond to GPD with questions or additional infor -
mation, he said.
William Kilmer, CEO of PublicEn-
gines, said the company has set up tech-nological and legal solutions to guaran-tee user anonymity.
During a conversation between 
police and citizens, no IP address or cellphone data is transmitted, he said. There is also a separate organization in place to prevent any legal pursuit of the tip provider.
“It’s  an easier way to have a two-way 
dialogue with the city,” Tobias said.
Since UF started sending out text 
and email alerts in 2008, students and faculty have been able to receive alerts faster than the previous email system, said Kenneth Allen, emergency man-agement coordinator for UF Environ-mental Health & Safety.
In a Fall 2012 survey administered 
to 683 UF students, alumni, faculty and parents, close to 70 percent of respon-dents said they were “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with the UF Alert system.
Amelia Butler, a 20-year-old public 
relations senior, is the founder of Lady Gators are R.A.D., an outreach organi-zation to increase student awareness of rape aggression defense classes offered through the University Police.
She said the organization has a sec-
tion on the website where students can ask questions directly to a university police officer without using their name or calling the police department.
“I think it’s something students feel 
more comfortable with,” she said. “I re-ally respect the fact that they’re going to offer something where students can increase their communication.”

The UF Bookstore has part-
nered with Better World Books 
to donate textbooks that cannot be sold back in support of world literacy.
UF Bookstore Director Lynne 
Vaughan said UF has been on a trial run with Better World Books for the past year but recently be-came an official partner.
Since the inception of Better 
World Book’s library discards and donations in 2004, more than 2,000 libraries across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have joined Better World Books.
The program manages discard-
ed and donated books by resell-ing them on BetterWorldBooks.com for up to 90 percent off, then shares the proceeds. According to the Better World Books website, one program, Book for Book, do-nates a book to a person in need every time a book is purchased online.
A portion of all the book sales goes to nonprofit literacy partners, Books for Africa and Feed the Children.
Nearly 7 million books have 
been donated.
“I think it’s wonderful to be 
able to give these books to people that need them,” Vaughan said. “We are keeping books from go-ing to landfills.”
Depending on the textbook re-
quests made by professors, not all textbooks sold at the beginning of the semester can be sold back to the bookstore, she said.
“It’s the books that do not have 
a value that we send to Better World Books,” Vaughan said.
Of the thousands of books sold 
at the beginning of the Fall semes-ter, 300 to 500 books were donat-ed.
“Students aren’t just recycling a 
book,” Vaughan said. “It’s helping someone economically to have ac-cess to something they might not have ever had access to before.”
Amanda Fretz, a 19-year-old 
Spanish sophomore, said UF’s involvement with Better World Books is fantastic. As a former English major, Fretz said she was a strong believer in reading at an early age.
“The bookstore doesn’t offer a 
high enough return for me to want to do buyback, so I’d love for my books to go to a good cause,” she said.
Celine Rodrigues, a 20-year-old 
biology junior and service director for Heal the World at UF, said she was also happy about UF’s in-volvement with the organization.
“This is a great thing for UF to 
be a part of to help spread the im-portance of education,” she said. “I have so many books just sitting there that I’m never going to look at again, I might as well put them to good use.”

In the wake of the holiday 
season and the onset of Spring 
semester, the Alachua Coun-ty Health Department urges Gainesville residents to take ac-tion to ward off the flu.
“The most effective precau-
tions we can use to fight illness are getting vaccinated before flu season and practicing good hy-giene regimes,” said Anthony Dennis, environmental health director for the Alachua County Health Department, in a state-ment.
While the flu and the com-mon cold share the same cat-egory as respiratory tract infec-tions, the flu tends to be more severe, according to a health department press release.
The department recom-
mends preventative measures such as washing hands with soap and water, avoiding touch-ing the face, covering mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, limiting exposure to sick people and getting the flu shot each year.
To get vaccinated, Gainesville 
residents can attend one of the department’s flu clinics at 224 SE 24th St. on Jan. 15 and Jan. 16 from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

UF is the best value public college in the 
state of Florida, according to Kiplinger’s Per -
sonal Finance magazine. 
The university ranked No. 3 for in-state 
and No. 11 for out-of-state.
Each school is ranked on its in-state and 
out-of-state cost. The tuition for each has dif-
ferent cost structures. In-state is first because more students who go to public universities choose one in their home state, said senior as-sociate editor Marc Wojno.
UF costs $16,593 per year for in-state tu-
ition and $38,870 for out-of-state tuition.
Other Florida schools on the list included 
Florida State University, University of Cen-tral Florida and University of South Florida.
Kiplinger is a publisher of business fore-
cast and advice. The rankings were based on cost and quality.
Kiplinger started with 600 public insti-
tutions and narrowed down the list to 130 based on academic quality and then ranked those schools on cost and financial aid.
The University of North Carolina at Cha-
pel Hill ranked No. 1 for in-state and No. 2 for out-of-state. Although the university’s tuition is more than UF’s, UNC’s cost is less after need-based aid is factored in. UNC cost about $18,000 for in-state tuition and with fi-nancial aid factored in, it cost about $6,000. At UF, after financial aid is applied, tuition cost about $9,000.
No. 2 for in-state was the University of 
Virginia, which switched places with UF this year.
Wojno said UF cost went up and test scores 
fell slightly , while UV A rose in test scores and four-year-graduation rate.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said these 
rankings seem fair and objective.
“The fact we’re No. 3 in very good com-
pany speaks very well for the university,” he said.

Campus infrastructure was a popular 
topic of discussion at UF’s Board of Trust-
ees meeting last month.
The trustees voted in favor of a make-
over for the Stephen C. O’Connell Center and a renovation of Newell Hall into a study center. 
The trustees also heard a report from 
Vice President for Business Affairs Curtis Reynolds regarding building a new presi-dent’s house.
About 82 percent of UF’s peer universi-
ties provide a house for their presidents, Reynolds said. The average size is about 10,000 square feet.
Current UF President Bernie Machen 
does not live in the house, which Reynolds said is outdated, hard to secure and not pri-vate. 
The building is “inadequate in size and 
facilities for the needs of an AAU school president,” Reynolds said.The President Housing 
Policy Subcommittee rec-ommended the construc-tion of an entirely new house on UF’s property. Private donations would 
fund the project, Reyn-olds said.
The new house would 
be built on the 7-acre former Baby Gator area on Village Drive, a location Reynolds said has buffer zones for the president’s privacy.
It would be about 8,000 to 10,000 square 
feet and would cost about $2 million.
The old house would become a facility 
for events and receptions, Reynolds said.
A motion was also passed to officially 
name the women’s lacrosse practice field as The Rob Gidel Family Practice Field. 
The new indoor tennis facility was 
named The Charles R. and Nancy V. Perry Indoor Tennis Facility.

PAUL NEWBERRY
AP National Writer
MIAMI (AP) — Sometimes, 
the buildup to a game can over-
whelm what actually happens on the field.
Certainly, No. 1 Notre Dame 
and No. 2 Alabama would have to play nothing less than a classic to live up to all the hype for Monday night’s BCS championship.
Before either team stepped on 
the field in balmy South Florida, this was shaping up as one of the most anticipated games in years.
College football’s two most sto-
ried programs, glorified in movie and song, facing off for the biggest prize.
“It’s definitely not any other 
game,” Alabama linebacker C.J. Mosley said.
For the Crimson Tide (12-1), 
this is a chance to be remembered as a full-fledged dynasty. Alabama will be trying to claim its third na-tional championship in four years and become the first school to win back-to-back BCS titles, a remark-able achievement given the ever-increasing parity of the college game and having to replace five players from last year’s title team who were picked in the first two rounds of the NFL draft.
“To be honest, I think this team 
has kind of exceeded expectations,” coach Nick Saban said Sunday.
“If you look at all the players 
we lost last year, the leadership that we lost ... I’m really proud of what this team was able to accom-plish.”
That said, it’s not a huge sur -
prise to find Alabama playing for another title. That’s not the case when it comes to Notre Dame.
Despite their impressive legacy, 
the Fighting Irish (12-0) weren’t even ranked at the start of the sea-son. But overtime wins against Stanford and Pittsburgh, com-bined with three other victories by a touchdown or less, gave Notre Dame a shot at its first national title since 1988.
After so many lost years, the 
golden dome has reclaimed its luster in coach Brian Kelly’s third season.
“It starts with setting a clear 
goal for the program,” Kelly said. “Really, what is it? Are we here to get to a bowl game, or are we here to win national championships? So the charge immediately was to play for championships and win a national championship.”Notre Dame,

Junior tight end Jordan Reed dives for a few extra yards during the Allstate Sugar Bowl in New 
Orleans. Reed was limited during Florida’s 33-23 loss to Louisville due to a left knee injury.
  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
  NEW ORLEANS — The Gators 
walked off the ﬁ  eld on Wednesday — 
many of them for the ﬁ  nal time — ex-periencing a range of emotions.
  While the disappointment of losing 
33-23 to Louisville in one of the biggest upsets in BCS bowl history stung, the ﬁ  nale dud in the Sugar Bowl was not enough to put a damper on Florida’s resurgent 2012.
  “Obviously this is a sour day and a 
sour note, and I apologize to our fans and the university,” coach Will Mus-champ said. “But we’ve had a great year, and we’re moving this thing for-ward at a rapid pace. And I’m excited where we are. Very disappointed with the outcome today, but very positive as we move forward.”
  The Gators rode a stout defense, 
powerful running game and resilient attitude to an 11-win season. Although each of those components disappoint-ed on Wednesday, the lackluster result could not dim the positive memories.
  Before long, the players were laugh-

  Florida notched wins against top-

�JACOBY BRISSETT AND 
CHRIS JOHNSON ARE THE 
FOURTH AND FIFTH FLORIDA PLAYERS TO TRANSFER SINCE DECEMBER.

 Alligator Staff Writer
  If there was any doubt that Jeff 
Driskel was Florida’s quarterback of 
the future following his shaky Sugar Bowl performance, it was erased on Sunday.
  UF announced that sophomore 
backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett will transfer. Florida also announced the release of running back Chris Johnson.
  “Both Jacoby and Chris expressed 
an interest in transferring and get-ting a fresh start,” coach Will Mus-champ said in the release. “We are very thankful for their contributions to the University of Florida and wish them the best of luck.”
Brissett committed to UF in Janu-
ary 2011 even though Driskel, Rivals.com’s top-ranked quarterback, had  already signed with the Gators.
  Driskel began the 2011 campaign 
as John Brantley’s backup, but an an-kle injury suffered against Alabama on Oct. 1 opened the door for Brissett  Sophomore backup 
quarterback to transferWHAT TO EXPECT
  For those of you who were here during the 
summer, you’re likely well aware that I’m a movie buff. I bombarded you with ref-
erences to “John Carter” and “The Dark Knight Rises” like my life depended on it. Fortunately for you, I toned it down during the fall.
  And don’t be alarmed when I begin this col-
umn with a line from a movie. You shouldn’t expect uncontrolled movie references from us this semester. Really, I promise.
  I recently watched Steven Spielberg’s “Lin-
coln,” and at one point during the ﬁ  lm, our 16th president — played by Daniel Day-Lewis — shouted, “Buzzards’ guts, man!”
  We all usually look at President Lincoln and 
see The Great Emancipator. A fearless leader. A stoic, serious man. That dude with the weird beard on the $5 bill.
  And then the guy yells, “Buzzards’ guts, 
man!” I mean, what the hell?
  When you really look at a person and listen 
to him or her talk for a bit, that’s when you re-ally get to know that person. To most of you, those of us here at alligatorSports are nothing more than the names in all caps before each story begins.
  Sharing stories is an 
intimate experience. People used to sit around campﬁ  res hud-dled together when a 
story was told. I’m not saying a run-of-the-mill midweek baseball story is the stuff of legend like a good ghost story, but there should be a connection between writers and their readers.
  That is why I invite you to email us. Tweet 
us. Approach us on campus.

At 5-foot-6, Carlie Needles is 
the shortest player on Florida’s 
roster. But Needles came up huge in the waning moments of the Gators’ victory on Sunday.  
With 12 seconds remaining 
and UF clinging to a three-point lead, Needles blocked LSU guard Adrienne Webb’s game-tying shot attempt.
Needles’ first career block 
helped Florida seal a 77-72 victory against LSU (10-5, 1-1 Southeast-ern Conference) in the O’Connell Center.
“She’s fearless; that’s what 
makes Carlie special,” coach Amanda Butler said. “Carlie is a tireless worker and really tough.”
Needles added: “I really didn’t 
even try to block it. I was just try-ing to get up and not let her get that three. (It was) a big stop for us.”
Florida (12-4, 1-1 SEC) was 
without senior Jennifer George down the stretch. With 5:06 left in the second half, George tan-gled with Webb under the Tigers’ basket. George’s right elbow and 
shoulder were caught under her body when she crashed violently to the court.
George screamed in pain and 
had to be helped off the floor by Florida’s medical staff. 
The forward returned to the 
bench minutes later with her right shoulder heavily wrapped and in a sling. 
After the game, Butler said she 
was unsure of the extent of her injury but would have a better estimation today. 
“[The medical staff] told me 
she wanted to go back in the game,” Butler said. “I’d say that’s probably a good indication.”
Before suffering the injury, 
George scored the first seven points of the game and finished with 15 points and 11 rebounds, her seventh double-double of the season. 
George exited the game with 
the score tied 62-62. Minus their top scorer, the Gators turned to junior Jaterra Bonds. 
Bonds scored a game-high 19 
points, including seven following George’s departure. 
“When [George] left, we were 
still able to grind it out and fin-ish,” Bonds said.
“We were able to fight back 
and bounce back on our home court.”
With Sunday’s victory, the Gators have won 15 consecutive games in the O’Connell Center.
More importantly, Sunday’s 
win helped Florida avoid an 0-2 start in SEC play.
“The way we won the game 
today is really important,” Butler said.“You aren’t going to play a lot 
of SEC games that are decided by 15 or 20 points. It’s just not going to happen. You’re going to have to grind it out to win games in this league.”

Early deficit prevented Gators from relying on rushing attack
past 11 weeks,” defensive tackle 
Omar Hunter said. “They came out and they weren’t going to be denied. They played a great game. Everything went their way.”
On Florida’s first offensive 
play, quarterback Jeff Driskel dropped back, looked left and fired a pass a few feet behind wideout Andre Debose.
Debose skidded to a stop and 
reached back with his right arm to try to corral the pass, instead tipping the ball into Louisville cornerback Terell Floyd’s hands.
Floyd ran 38 yards uncon-
tested for the score, giving the Cardinals a lead they never relin-quished. 
“We never got the momen-
tum,” UF tight end Jordan Reed said.
Florida’s plus-17 turnover 
margin was one of the biggest keys to its four-win improvement from 2011, but the Gators posted a minus-2 on Wednesday.
Also critical was UF’s pass de-
fense, which entered tops in the nation in efficiency before being torched by Teddy Bridgewater to the tune of 266 yards and two 
touch-downs.
E v e n 
F l o r i d a ’ s dominant 
rushing attack, so key to an of-fense that struggled through the air, never got on a roll. The Gators were constantly playing catch-up and ran the ball a season-low 30 times as a result.
UF’s signature post-halftime outburst was also absent. The Gators opened Wednesday’s second half with an onside kick attempt, but a Cardinals’ recov-ery and personal foul penal-ties against Chris Johnson and Loucheiz Purifoy put Louisville at Florida’s 19-yard line.
Bridgewater needed only one 
play to extend Louisville’s lead to 30-10, tossing a touchdown pass to Damian Copeland.
“This whole season we’ve been 
playing as one of the best teams in the nation in the second half,” Evans said. “I thought we were going to pull it off, like we usual-ly do. But they came through and pushed forward and did a hell of a job in the second half.”
That UF even expected to 
come back is a reflection on Mus-champ.A season after Florida needed 
a win in the Gator Bowl to secure a 7-6 finish, the culture changed. Gone is the team Muschamp called “soft” after a loss against Florida State in 2011.
“This team has made great 
gains from where it was last year,” defensive tackle Omar Hunter said. “With coach Mus-champ and his staff coming in and changing the face of this pro-gram, it’s been great.”
Florida is stronger and tough-
er, a reputation that can not be shaken by a single loss at the end of the season.
“[Muschamp] transformed us 
from what we were to what we are now,” Reed said. “We’re just going to keep getting better from here.”
Florida is losing nine senior starters, and juniors Matt Elam, Sharrif Floyd and Jordan Reed, who announced their intentions to skip their senior season and enter the NFL Draft. Dominique Easley and Jelani Jenkins may also decide to forgo their senior year and enter the draft.
But Muschamp will reload, 
hauling in a recruiting class that Rivals rates No. 5 in the nation.
More immediately, the Gators 
and sophomore quarterback Jeff Driskel will turn their focus to an offseason of preparation, looking for ways to build on 2012’s im-pressive turnaround.
“It hurts that we lost like this,” 
guard Jon Halapio said. “But we will come back next year.”

to start the following weekend against LSU.
When Driskel regained his health, Brissett 
remained the backup. Brissett started in two 
games and played in eight, throwing for 206 yards, two touchdowns and four intercep-tions. 
Brissett battled Driskel for the starting spot 
throughout spring and fall camp in 2012, ulti-mately losing the competition. 
Following Week 1, Brissett only played in 
four games for UF, including a start in place of Driskel (ankle) in a 23-0 win against Jackson-ville State on Nov. 17.
Driskel will begin his second year as Flor -
ida’s starting quarterback with one fewer of-fensive weapon. Tight end Jordan Reed an-nounced on Saturday via a UF release that he would forgo his senior season and declare for the NFL Draft.
Reed led the Gators with 44 catches for 552 
yards this year.
“I’ve enjoyed four good years at Florida, but I feel that now is the right time to pursue my dream of playing in the NFL,” Reed said in the statement.
“I appreciate the support from all the 
coaches and staff here, and I’ll always be a Gator.”
The departures of Reed, Brissett and John-
son bring Florida’s mark the total of under -
classmen departures at seven.
Following UF’s 33-23 loss in the Sugar 
Bowl, defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd and safe-ty Matt Elam announced they would enter the 2013 NFL Draft.
Now, Florida faces the task of rebounding 
from one of its worst defensive performances of the season without All-SEC first-teamers Floyd and Elam.
Even though the coaches advised him to go 
pro, Floyd said the decision to leave Florida was not an easy one.
“We’re going to walk away from the pro-
gram we’ve been in for three years and bond-ed with a lot of people, so it’s emotional and you feel it,” Floyd said.
Floyd added that he did not make his de-cision final until after the Sugar Bowl. His 13 tackles for loss led the team.
Elam, a first-team All-American, finished 
with 76 tackles — 11 for a loss. Both totals ranked second on the team.
He recorded 176 tackles and six intercep-
tions in his career.
“I had three great years,” Elam said. “I did 
all I can for the team, you know what I’m say-ing? I played my heart out. I feel like it’s time to take care of the family.”
Based on projections, UF will have a junior 
drafted for the first time since 2010.
Defensive end Dominique Easley and line-
backer Jelani Jenkins are still contemplating whether or not to return and will have to come to a decision by the Jan. 15 deadline.
Easley, who had 3.5 tackles for loss in the 
Sugar Bowl, declined to discuss his future af-ter the game, but said Floyd and Elam’s deci-sions would have no bearing on his.
“It’s my life, my decision,” Easley said. 
“I’m not really sure yet. I’ll make that decision probably in the next week.”
Jenkins missed the bowl game with a frac-
tured right foot. He didn’t speak to the media.
He missed four games this season and 
parts of two others with a broken thumb and a hamstring injury.
Senior defensive tackle Omar Hunter said 
the juniors did a good job of not letting their NFL prospects affect their preparation.
““Man, I respect it a ton,” Hunter said. 
“When I was a redshirt freshman and seeing some older guys, that’s all they talked about. ‘NFL, NFL, NFL.’ These guys, they don’t even worry about that stuff. They just play every game like it’s their last game and not worry about that kind of stuff.”

Louisville wanted to be 
here.
  The Cardinals were ex-
cited to play in the Sugar Bowl. After winning this year’s Big East Conference crown, a trip to the French Quarter was icing on a damn delicious cake.
  A reward.  Louisville earned a chance to 
spar with a superpower from the almighty Southeastern Confer-ence. An opportunity to shut up the annoying “S-E-C! S-E-C! S-E-C!” chants.
T  he Cardinals seized the mo-
ment.
  “We made our statement for 
the upcoming season,” Louisville wide receiver Eli Rogers said af-ter his squad’s dominant upset victory. “Versus a team like Flori-da, this means everything for our program going forward.”
  The Gators didn’t want to be 
there.
  After a magical 11-1 season, 
Florida watched two other one-loss SEC teams battle for the league title. Alabama and Geor-gia fought for a spot in the BCS National Championship Game. 
The Gators boasted the best 
resume in college football, but that wasn’t enough to earn them a shot at the national title. They were shut out.
  The Sugar Bowl was a consola-
tion prize. Nothing more.
  What was in store for Florida 
had it proved victorious in New Orleans? They don’t make rings for 12-win seasons.
  At least not the ones people 
remember.
  When was the last time some-
one asked Jim Kelly to see his four AFC title rings?
  Some Gators dreamed of the 
NFL. Others blew off curfew and partied through the night on Bourbon Street.
The Sugar Bowl was nice, but 
Florida dreamed of Miami.   Notre Dame. The crystal football.
  They didn’t care about a silly 
exhibition game. There was noth-ing more to accomplish. Their season was already over.
  Why bother?Gator Nation had the same 
attitude  . Times are tough. The economy is bad. Why blow a lot of money to watch a football game that doesn’t even matter?
  Watching the action in high 
deﬁ  nition from your couch was the preferred option, the embodi-ment of two sacred American values: cheapness and comfort.
  The 54,178 fans who attended the Sug-ar Bowl m a r k e d the low-est turn-out for this game s i n c e 1939.
  Those who made the trip came 
to party. The Sugar Bowl was merely an excuse to ring in the New Year in style.
  And they serve alcohol at 
bowl games, so “Laissez les bons temps rouler!” Go Gators!
  Florida didn’t care about this 
game. Neither did its fans.
  And who can blame them?  Schools like Louisville dream 
of the BCS. But until the Sugar Bowl becomes part of a playoff bracket in college football, don’t expect the big boys to play their hearts out.
  It’s wrong. It’s lazy. You 
would expect pride to be at stake, but that is too ideal. Maybe it is too much to ask when a system as ﬂ  awed as the BCS is in place.
  The Cardinals wanted to be 
here, and they acted like it.
Good for them. They are a 
promising team headed in the right direction — quickly.
  As for the Gators, they fell short of the ultimate prize. And no bowl victory was going to sat-isfy that hunger.So why bother?  Contact Joe Morgan at joemor-

�BOYNTON’S 28 POINTS 
TIED A CAREER-HIGH.
  KATIE AGOSTIN
 Alligator Staff Writer
  After a rough stretch offen-
sively, guard Kenny Boynton 
rediscovered his shot. 
  In the Gators’ four contests 
leading up to No. 13 Florida’s 79-58 victory against Yale in New Haven, Conn., Boynton averaged only 9.25 points per game on 29 percent shooting from the ﬁ  eld.  
  But Sunday night against the 
Bulldogs was a different story. Boynton tied a career-high 28 points. 
  Boynton also helped Florida 
shoot 60 percent by going 9 of 12, including shooting 8 of 10 behind the arc, the Gators’ best shooting percentage since Nov. 14.
  “It was good for him to get 
out of that funk,” coach Billy Donovan said. “For someone that’s had the kind of slump like he’s had … it was great to see him break out the way he did.”
  Ending his cold streak wasn’t 
Boynton’s only accomplishment Sunday night.
The senior broke Lee Hum-
phrey’s record for career three-pointers at Florida, pushing his total to 290.   
  “It means a lot,” Boynton 
said.
“When I was younger, I came 
to Florida games, and I watched Lee Humphrey play. He was a great shooter.” 
  Junior Scottie Wilbekin led 
Florida (10-2) in assists during their 21-point win against Yale (5-11).
  Wilbekin recorded a career-
high 10 assists, beating his pre-vious best of eight, which he set against UCF on Nov. 23.
  Forward Will Yeguete also 
had a strong night for the Gators.
Despite sustaining an injury 
to his nose in the ﬁ  rst half, Yeg-uete reentered the game with a bandage on his cut and put up 14 points, nine rebounds, an assist and a steal during his 27 minutes.
  Erik Murphy sat out Sun-
day’s game due to an injury he sustained to his ribs during Fri-day’s practice.
Murphy entered Sunday as 
UF’s second-leading scorer, av-eraging 12.1 points per game.
  Murphy is doubtful for 
Florida’s Southeastern Confer-ence opener against Georgia on Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.
  Although the Gators may 
have to play without Murphy as they start their SEC season, Boynton is making sure Florida doesn’t get complacent.
  “Don’t take any team for 
granted in the SEC because it’s basically like a startover,” Boynton said.
“It’s a new season.”

Senior guard Kenny Boynton attempts a shot during Florida’s 78-61 victory against Air Force on Dec. 29 in the BB&T Center.
 Guard’s shooting lifts UF against Yale
  With football season in 
the rear-view mirror and a two-month non-
conference slate complete, Flor-ida basketball is ﬁ  nally ready to step into the spotlight.  
  On Sunday, UF survived an 
early scare and overcame Erik Murphy’s absence in a drub-bing of Yale. Florida carries a 10-2 record into Southeastern Conference play, which tips off with a home matchup against Georgia on Wednesday. 
  While the conference slate 
won’t be a cakewalk, the Gators should be disappointed with anything less than a title. 
  In reality, the SEC is a three-
team league. Only Florida, Ken-tucky and Missouri have a le-gitimate shot at the crown. 
    As is the case throughout col-
lege basketball this season, each of the contenders has legitimate ﬂ  aws. 
  Kentucky, as always, is 
young and talented, but not nearly as talented as last year’s group. Nerlens Noel is Worse Anthony Davis and Alex Poyth-ress is Worse Michael Kidd-Gil-christ. 
  Judging Kentucky’s merit  is 
nearly impossible this early in the season. The majority of UK’s key players are still adjusting to the college game, and point guard Ryan Harrow has only been a key piece of the rotation for half of the year after dealing with illness and family issues in the early going. The Wildcats will only get better than their 9-4 record as the season rolls on, but their potential is capped compared to last year. 
  SEC newcomer Missouri is 
also still learning. After estab-lishing a reputation as a guard-heavy bunch known for giving opponents 40 minutes of hell, the Tigers have switched up their style. Michael Dixon was expect-ed to be one of the best guards in the SEC, but he was kicked off the team on Nov. 29 after mul-tiple  allega-tions of sexual assault came to light. 
  B u t  
e v e n 
without Dixon playing a min-ute this season, the Tigers start-ed strong at 11-2. The arrival of UConn transfer Alex Oriakhi and Laurence Bowers’ return from an ACL injury give Mis-souri a presence in the front-court. 
  Florida plays Missouri and 
Kentucky twice each, meaning the league will likely be won or lost head-to-head. That could be good news for the Gators, who match up favorably with both contenders. 
  After rotating three lead 
guards last year, Missouri has only one, albeit a damn good one in Phil Pressey. Whether UK settles on the sophomore Harrow or freshman Archie Goodwin at the point, UF’s press matches up well. Florida should be able to wear down Pressey and force youthful UK into mistakes. 
  UF will have more good 
matchups when Kentucky and Missouri get into their half-court offense. Both UF’s pesky zone — more common with 5-foot-6 Erving Walker gradu-ating out of the rotation — and collapsing man-to-man should do well against Missouri and Kentucky offenses that rarely rely on jump shooting. 
  On the other side of the 
ball, neither team presses well enough or often enough to give UF any real issues.
  As long as Murphy’s rib in-
jury isn’t serious and the Gators keep their balance on offense and intensity on defense, an SEC title is well within reach.

tion’s ﬁ  fth-ranked defense with 266 passing yards and two touchdowns.
  Florida’s defense, arguably the 
best unit in the Southeastern Con-ference, failed to match Bridgewater and his Big East receivers.
  A nearly ﬂ  awless performance 
put the sophomore in the national spotlight.
  “I wouldn’t be in this situation 
right now ... without my team-mates,” Bridgewater said. “The Heisman campaign may start, but I’m just enjoying this moment.”
  No. 4 Florida (11-2, 7-1 SEC) al-
ready faced Heisman Trophy win-ner in Johnny Manziel, before allow-ing a season-high 266 passing yards to Bridgewater on Wednesday . The previous best was 236 yards by Mis-souri quarterback James Franklin on Nov. 3.
  Despite throwing a third-quarter 
interception, Bridgewater took ad-vantage of a  secondary that couldn’t solve the Cardinals’ quick passing attack.
  “Of all the quarterbacks we 
played, he was the best,” Gators defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd said. “He had the best accuracy . Manziel don’t compare to him.”
  Louisville entered the game as a double-digit underdog. It lost to Connecticut and Syracuse this season. Bridgewater wasn’t even 100-percent healthy  Wednesday after dealing with wrist and ankle injuries throughout the year.
 T he quarterback who wears 
gloves on both hands and stores Ba-zooka bubble gum in his socks dur-ing games surprised the Gators with his complete performance.
  “I didn’t think he was that good 
until he showed us different,” defen-sive tackle Dominique Easley said.
  Bridgewater converted 9 of 14 
third down opportunities, which included 3 of 4 longer than 10 yards out. He completed 7 of 11 passes on third down.
  Florida, the nation’s 10th-ranked 
third-down defense at 31 percent conversions allowed, couldn’t get Bridgewater off the ﬁ  eld.
  Strong almost didn’t get the op-
portunity to coach this game-chang-ing quarterback, who already has 23 starts and a BCS bowl victory in his two-year career.
  Bridgewater, a standout at prep 
football power Miami Northwestern High, was committed to his home-town Hurricanes until he switched to Louisville following the ﬁ  ring of former Miami coach Randy Shan-non.
  He exhibited toughness and re-
straint against Florida, especially when linebacker Jon Bostic drilled him and knocked off his helmet on his ﬁ  rst pass attempt in the ﬁ  rst quarter.
  “I give it all to Teddy Bridgewa-
ter,” Easley said. “He is a great quar-terback. He knows how to execute and take control of his team. He broke us apart.”
  Despite Bridgewater’s banner 
performance, the poor outing from the Florida defense was surprising.
  Redshirt senior defensive tackle 
Omar Hunter found a silver lining in a game with not much to cheer about for Florida.
  “Defense didn’t execute the way 
we wanted it to,” he said. “But this team will learn from it going for-ward next year and will be that much better because of it.”

 �FLORIDA DEFEATED BALL STATE 
196.575-190.55.
CHUCK KINGSBURY
Alligator Writer
As a team primed to return to the 
NCAA Tournament with hopes of 
finishing beyond the Super Six, No. 3 Florida kicked off its regular season on a high note.
The Gators opened with a convinc-
ing 196.575-190.55  victory against Ball 
State in a home dual meet on Friday night in the O’Connell Center.
Friday’s meet marked the third-
highest scoring total in the program’s opening history, nearly eclipsing its 196.925 score against Nebraska in 2011.  
“We achieved a lot of the goals we 
were looking to achieve knowing that we weren’t really going to have the goal of being 100 percent prepared,” coach Rhonda Faehn said.  
“It was just a matter of getting new 
faces out there, new routines and get-ting our feet wet.”
Despite the long offseason, Florida 
did not disappoint.
Led by senior Ashanée Dickerson 
and sophomore Kytra Hunter, the Gators outperformed Ball State in ev-ery aspect of the meet, posting scores of 49.325 and 49.175 in vault and bars, respectively.  
“The lineups that the coaches put 
out were perfect for us considering we were coming back from break and had such a short amount of time to train with the team,” Hunter said. “We did excellent.”
Hunter, who was named the Honda 
Award winner for gymnastics in 2011, designating her as the nation’s top col-legiate gymnast, matched her career-best of 9.90 to win the evening’s uneven bars title.
She posted the same score in the 2012 
NCAA Championships semifinal.
Dickerson set the highest vault and 
bars score to earn her 14th all-around win and her 60th event title. Dickerson recovered from a fall on the beam with a strong 9.875 floor event.
“I was pleased with how they did 
and the energy that they had tonight,” Faehn said.
The meet couldn’t have come any 
sooner for the Jacksonville native, who was anxious to perform.
“We’ve been waiting for this since 
we got back to school, and we’ve been preparing for it,” Dickerson said. “For the last week we’ve been counting down the days.”
Faehn felt the team performed ex-
ceptionally well despite a long absence from competition, and noted that she wasn’t looking for fine tuning, fluent dismounts or sticks, but rather control-ling nerves.
Faehn positioned Dickerson first in 
the bars rotation for the first time since her freshman year and revealed Hunt-er’s new tumbling pass.
More importantly, the meet was an 
opportunity for Faehn to evaluate tal-ent,  including freshman Bridget Sloan.
“I wasn’t looking at the scores. I 
was more concerned with how Bridget would do,” Faehn said.
“She’s incredibly talented and she 
has this competitive experience, but she’s in a completely new environ-ment.”
Sloan displayed the same poise and 
uncanny maturity she developed on the Olympic stage in 2008 as the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic team that medaled silver.
She recorded a 9.925 on her vault 
routine to earn a share of the night’s event title with Dickerson.
Junior Mackenzie Caquatto com-
peted in her first competitive beam per -
formance since the 2011 NCAA Cham-pionships, recording a 9.875 to earn the beam title. Caquatto did not participate in UF’s beam lineup due to ankle inju-ries sustained during her tryouts for the U.S. 2011 World Championships.
Florida will face No. 8 LSU on Friday 
in the Gators’ first Southeastern Confer -
ence event.
