The blue trees on Turlington Plaza are 
fading away as the paint nears the end 
of its life expectancy, and students have taken notice.
Although the natural bark peeking 
through the blue paint looks to some like the trees are now orange and blue, to others, the trees just look like they haven’t been maintained.
“It became a waste of money because 
it wasn’t kept up,” said Steven Turner, a 22-year-old UF food science and human nutrition senior.
However, UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said the paint will chip away.
“The paint was intended to last six to 12 
months,” Orlando said. “We’re now at the outer edge of the time frame. It is lasting longer than anticipated.”
Some students were upset that the 
blue trees, which were intended to raise awareness for deforestation, in front of the Reitz Union were removed for construction.
“You shouldn’t take down trees for 
deforestation,” said Brittany Weintraut, an 
18-year-old UF health science freshman. “It shows we care a little bit, but not 
fullheartedly care.”
But Orlando said the artist was aware 
that the trees would be removed for the construction and painted them anyway.
The trees will be replaced after the 
construction, Orlando said.
“The goal of raising awareness was 
accomplished, and they will be replaced,” 
he said.Though chipping, blue trees continue conversation

STAFF REPORT
Today, people all around the United States 
will take to Facebook and Twitter expressing 
their thoughts and concerns about the 9/11 ter-
rorist attacks.
But if social media was as prevalent 12 years 
ago, the coverage of the events would have 
been different. Instead of turning on TVs to watch the news broadcasts, people would go 
online.
David Ostroff, UF College of Journalism and 
Communications chair of telecommunication, 
said more information would be ﬂ  owing.
“I think, obviously, there would have been a 
lot more information coming around,” he said.
But the inﬂ  ux of information would be cha-
otic, forcing people to spend time making sense 
of it, he said.
Bruce Floyd, UF social media expert, agreed 
that coverage would have been different if these technologies were around 12 years ago. He said 
the event could have been crowdsourced.“News agencies would scour social media 
to ﬁ  nd discussion about what is happening and piece things together in real time,” he said.
Molly Disabb, a 19-year-old UF wildlife 
ecology and conservation sophomore, said she 
isn’t going to post anything about the terrorist 
attacks online.
“I like to keep my affairs 
private on the matter. I don’t 
feel Facebook is the place to 
discuss that,” she said.
However, Floyd believes 
Disabb will be in the minor-ity. He anticipates many 
students will post about the 
tragedy on Facebook and 
Twitter. Floyd said he en-
courages students to be cautious about what they put online.
“Don’t be surprised if someone responds 
positively or negatively,” he said. “Being that 
it is 9/11, there are still some sensitivities out there.”Internet would’ve impacted 9/11

TUESDAY NIGHT.
STAFF REPORT
Following President Barack Obama’s 
speech Tuesday night, which outlined a 
national course of action — or inaction — toward Syria, Gainesville opinions are mixed, as were President Obama’s messages, some locals said.
In his speech, Obama called for di-
plomacy instead of military action, but he left the option of an air strike open while conﬁ  rming he wouldn’t put troops on the ground. He asked Con-gress to postpone a vote to use force, and instead said he is working with the United Nations to come up with resolu-tion that would force Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s president, to give up chemical weapons.
UF associate professor of U.S. and in-
ternational history Matthew Jacobs said Obama called Syria a national security threat but not an immediate one, leav-ing the scope of the threat ambiguous. 
“There was some tension there that 
came out in the speech, I think,” he said.Obama talks diplomacy,

Two kittens sit in a cage at the Alachua County Humane Society 
on Tuesday afternoon. Unvaccinated cats are the domestic out-door animals most at risk for developing rabies in the state.
EMILY BUCHANAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Alachua County ranked among 
the highest for reported cases of ra-
bies in animals this year, according 
to recently released data from the 
Florida Department of Health.
Those numbers don’t necessarily 
reﬂ  ect negatively on the county’s 
dogs and cats, said Vernon Sawyer, 
director of Alachua County Animal Services.
“Primarily in Alachua County, 
bats and raccoons are the source of 
rabies,” he said.
According to data, 45 out of 68 
cases were related to raccoons in-
fected with rabies. 
Alachua County had reported 
four cases within the year: two cases with raccoons and two cases with bats.
Sawyer said the numbers are due 
to the county having a large rural area that is often being disrupted by construction. 
He said because of the human 
invasion, animals are looking for different sources of food and com-ing into contact with humans more frequently.
Jennifer Gray, a 22-year-old UF 
ﬁ  rst-year veterinary medicine stu-dent, said she agreed.
“Anything to disrupt the envi-
ronment will cause animals to come out of their habitats,” she said. “I just saw a raccoon on campus the other night.”
Gray said education is essential 
in keeping people safe. She said many people do not realize when they see unfamiliar animals out in daylight that they can still be harm-ful and can possibly be carrying 
rabies.
Samantha Wisely, a UF wildlife 
ecology and conservation associate 
professor, said rabies is a disease 
that generally requires a large num-ber of hosts to become a high risk to 
humans.
“Wherever there are high popu-
lation densities of raccoons, since 
it’s the leading carrier of rabies, is 
where rabies will be prominent,” Wisely said.
Wisely and Sawyer both said the 
data varies from year to year. 
Wisely explained that because 
the disease is fatal, the areas dense with the disease ﬂ  uctuates as in-fected animals die, and the cycle 
repeats.
“This is exactly why it’s so im-
portant to have animals vaccinat-
ed,” Sawyer said.
Ashley Coxen, a 21-year-old 
UF animal sciences senior, said pet shelters and adoptions usually have a fee associated with adopting an animal because it may already 
come with all shots that are neces-
sary for the animal’s health, which includes a rabies shot.
“We’re in a college town,” Cox-
en said, “and I would bet most col-
lege kids don’t spend the money on 
their animals’ shots because they don’t think they need them, which is not true.”Alachua County has high number of 
rabies cases — mostly bats and raccoons
“Wherever there are 
high population densities 
of raccoons, since it’s the 
leading carrier of rabies, 
is where rabies will be 
prominent.”

UF Students for a Democratic Society protest the United States’ intervention in Syria. Obama addressed 
the nation Tuesday night and called for diplomacy but left options open for military action.
Locals’ opinions differ
Jacobs said an intriguing point of 
the speech was Obama’s “effort to 
deal with a range of criticism.” He compared the promises that there would be “no boots on the ground” and that the U.S.’s involvement “won’t be prolonged” with the po-tential impact of what Obama called “deter and degrade” — to prevent Syrian usage of nuclear weapons.
“He’s trying to walk a very fine 
line, which forces him into these sort of contradictory statements,” Jacobs said.
Jacobs said he thought the presi-
dent did a good job laying out the moral argument for why Syria is a problem, but he said Obama left the government’s next steps unclear in the event of Congress voting “no” to his proposition.
 Skye Schmelzer, a 21-year-old 
UF history senior and a lead orga-nizer of Students for a Democratic Society, said Obama’s talk of an air-strike is narrow-minded. She said regardless of the timing of a U.S. airstrike, it’s in Obama’s interest to play a policing role.
Although Sameer Saboungi, a 19-
year old international studies soph-omore and Syrian-American, also disagreed with Obama’s speech, he said it was because he was disap-pointed in Obama’s inaction.
“I think the risks of inaction are 
greater than the risks of action,” he said. “We’re not addressing the root of the problem. Chemical weapons are a symptom of the problem.”
However, Dante Frisiello, a 20-
year-old UF philosophy and politi-cal science junior, called the presi-dent’s speech “spot on.”
“It was probably the first time 
since he’s taken office that I’ve agreed with every word he said,” Frisiello said. 
He said letting a conflict go 
would set a precedent, sending a message that a country can use chemical weapons against its own people without consequence.  
“You can’t let that go,” Frisiello 
said. “For a guy who constantly gets criticized for not being tough enough, he definitely scored with this.”

As people across the U.S. are collecting pe-
titions and lobbying for legislation that would 
outlaw unpaid internships, some locals are ex-pressing mixed opinions about changing what has become a corporate norm.
Jeremiah Tattersall, of the Alachua County 
Wage Theft Task Force, said he disagrees with unpaid internships. In fact, he said, they can be filed as cases of wage theft. The 27-year-old UF alumnus is working to find local remedies to wage theft, which includes illegal withholding, underpayment or nonpayment of wages.
“The problem with internships is that most 
people don’t know what their rights are,” he 
said. “About half of college internships are 
not paid, and unless they follow a very strict guideline set up by the Department of Labor, they should be getting paid at least minimum wage.”
However, Chad Paris, the owner of local de-
sign and printing firm Parisleaf, said student in-terns are working for themselves, gaining expe-rience that will pay off later. Mandating a wage would dry up the opportunities for students to do professional work for firms, he said.
Paris has had about 20 interns since 2010. 
Four are now employees. Although he said the company can’t afford to pay all of its interns, it is giving them opportunities to learn and create portfolios to help make money in the future.
“We would never exploit our interns — it’s 
not about how much sugar we like in our cof-fee,” Paris said. “We give them an amazing opportunity that will help them make life deci-
sions. By paying them, we wouldn’t be able to 
help as many people.”
Tattersall said students should reap the ben-
efits. To educate them, he is pushing to create a fact sheet for freshmen welcome packets with information about their rights.
“I’m hoping by the end of the semester or 
early next semester that we’ll actually have the Student Government behind us and the UF ad-
ministration,” Tattersall said. “No one wants to 
send their kids to college unprepared.”
Zack Peterson, a 20-year-old UF journalism 
junior, spent the summer working at the Valley News in Vermont. Peterson said he wasn’t re-imbursed for his labor, but he didn’t complain about the situation.
“I had a good experience,” he said, “but I 
had a scholarship.”Locals debate unpaid internships
� RESIDENTIAL UTILITIES 
WILL GO UP $17 A MONTH.
HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org
Gainesville Regional Utilities 
rates will increase for all services be-
ginning Oct. 1 — a measure OK’d by 
the City Commission that may leave businesses unharmed but strain families, some residents say.
Due to the addition of the bio-
mass plant, residential utilities prices will increase by 7.3 percent, or about $17 per month, based on the company’s projections, said GRU spokeswoman Amelia Bell.
“The key reasons for the increas-
es are declining sales over the past 
several years and the addition of a 
new renewable generation source,” Bell wrote in an email.
Evelyn Foxx, president of the Ala-
chua County branch of the NAACP, said the projected rate increase is 
both disheartening and disturbing.
“If your rates go up $15 a month, 
that’s money you don’t have to buy 
medication or put food on your ta-ble,” she said. “It doesn’t look very promising.”
Foxx said the lower-income pop-
ulation of Gainesville will likely bear the brunt of the increase.“We disproportionately pay most 
of it, even with the rate changes,” Foxx said. “It’s a no-win situation, 
so we just got to deal with it, fussing 
about it isn’t going to do any good.”  
But for some businesses, the rate 
changes that will soon take effect are negligible.
Roger Beebe, owner of local store 
Video Rodeo, said the rates will af-fect his business, but the benefits of the plant outweigh the rising costs.
“I hear people complaining that 
the GRU rates are going to make or break us, and I think that’s sort of in-sane,” he said. “I think if we pay a few more pennies — or a few more dollars — each month, it’s not going to drive us out of business.”
Beebe said because his business 
doesn’t create huge profits, any 
fluctuation in finances makes a dif-
ference. Still, he is in favor of the bio-mass plant and is OK with paying the increased rates.
Jonathan Watkins, manager of 
Modern Age Tobacco and Gift Shop, agreed that although the rate chang-es are noticeable, they will “not be that significant” in the long run.
Bell said GRU is also making ef-
forts to reduce the effect of the bio-mass plant by refinancing existing debts and cutting the original 2014 budget by about $10.8 million.
City Commissioner Thomas 
Hawkins said the plant is more ex-
pensive because it is new, and the 
type of fuel used has nothing to do with the price increase.
“The biggest driver in increasing 
costs is the purchase power agree-ment for the biomass plant,” he said. “The first couple of years you pay above market, but in the long run, you save money.”
City, residents mull effects of upcoming utilities rate increase
“If your rates go up $15 a 
month, that’s money you don’t 
have to buy medication or put 
food on your table.”

OCT. 19 TO 27.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Mayor Ed Braddy and an official 
delegation are gearing up for a trip to 
Rzeszow, Poland, to represent the City of Gainesville for the first time there.
Through the Sister City Program, 
Gainesville already collaborates with Rzeszow, a leading city of innovation in Poland. The weeklong conference, which is slated to run from Oct. 19 to Oct. 27, aims to establish a stronger re-lationship between the two.
Some of the delegates are UF profes-
sors and officials who will build rela-tionships with professors in Rzeszow.
In February 2013, a delegation of six representatives from Poland visited Gainesville, and Rzeszow became an official sister city during a signing in a Gainesville City Commission meeting.
Rzeszow is similar to Gainesville in 
many ways, said Margaret Andraka, di-rector of the Gainesville-Rzeszow Sister City Program. It has two universities, so 
it has a similar demographic. Rzeszow 
seeks to become a leader in medical and science innovation just as Gainesville has done with institutions like UF Health Shands Hopsital, she said.
“Leaders in Rzeszow are anxious to 
learn from Gainesville,” said Steve Kal-ishman, president of Gainesville’s Sister City Program.
The goal is to exchange activities and 
formal agreements to secure relation-ships that will allow more opportunities for new groups to travel.Sister City Program of

Sarah, a 22-year-old UF alumna, is dia-
betic.
“When my blood sugar drops, I black out,” 
she said.
During her ﬁ  rst semester in college, she 
said she experienced a severe drop in her 
blood sugar at a party. Sarah was at a house shared by eight guys, all members of fraterni-ties.
“When we got to the party, I walked in and 
blacked out,” she said. “The next memory I have is waking up in my bed.”
When Sarah woke up in her dorm room 
alone, she said she “felt lost and confused.” 
She said she was in pain. Her phone was miss-
ing — and so was her underwear.
In a panic, she borrowed a phone and 
called her friends to try to piece together what had happened the night before.
Sarah’s friends tracked down her phone. 
One of the boys who threw the party had it, and he was angry. He told Sarah she could have her phone back — after she cleaned his 
sheets. His comforter was covered in blood.
Sarah said she was raped in the boy’s room 
by one of his friend’s younger brothers, a high 
school student visiting for the weekend.
She said she was attacked while she was in 
a blackout. Sarah was a virgin.
“I was in denial for months,” she said. “I 
was lost.”
Sarah was diagnosed with post-traumatic 
stress disorder. She recently stopped taking anti-anxiety medication.
She said she was harassed after the attack 
by people who thought she was lying. Behind her back — and sometimes to her face — they called her “the girl who cried rape.”
Sarah reported the attack to Gainesville Po-
lice. There is a team of detectives that handles all sexual battery cases, according to GPD 
Spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.One of those detectives was assigned to 
Sarah’s case.
Tobias said after talking to multiple wit-
nesses, police determined Sarah was not the 
victim of a sexual battery.
Sarah said the detective told her that “if 
girls stop putting themselves in these types of situations, I wouldn’t have to deal with cases like this.”
…
Through Tobias, the detective declined re-
quests to comment for this story. 
However, Tobias said the behavior Sarah 
alleged is uncharacteristic of the detective.
“I’ve known [the detective] for many years, 
and I deﬁ  nitely don’t think that’s something [the detective] would say,” Tobias said.
He added that it “may seem on the surface 
that the Gainesville Police Department does not care about [sexual battery victims], but that couldn’t be further from the truth. We care very much.”
Tanja Philhower worked on Sarah’s case 
in 2009. At that time, Philhower was a victim advocate at the University Police. 
Laura Kalt, a victim advocate for Gainesville 
Police, spoke about Sarah’s case very brieﬂ  y before declining further comment.
Kalt said she never had direct contact with 
Sarah, only with Philhower, Sarah’s victim advocate. Kalt said she received a call from 
Philhower asking her to check on the case.
Sarah said the detective didn’t answer her calls for weeks while her case was open. 
At one point, Philhower had to call Kalt on 
Sarah’s behalf to make contact with the detec-tive.
About a year after she ﬁ  led her case, Sarah 
said, she was told the paperwork was lost.
When asked how it was possible for a case 
ﬁ  le to be lost, Tobias said, “Case ﬁ  les do not 
get lost because they are managed electroni-cally — since 2005.”
The copy of Sarah’s case ﬁ  les, which she 
still has, contains notes from interviews con-
ducted in 2009. Tobias said that usually ofﬁ  -
cers maintain most of their notes themselves.
In the GPD document Procedures & Flow 
for the Criminal Investigations division, Sec-
tion 5.01.05 B stipulates that, “Supervisors will 
make appropriate data entry into the computer system of the incident reports. Supplemental reports will be completed within ten (10) days of receiving an OPEN case for investigation. Additional supplements will be due every ten (10) days thereafter until the case is closed.”
Sarah’s copy of the case ﬁ  le shows no infor-
mation was inputted into the GPD database 
until February 2011, nearly 15 months after 
the initial report. Tobias conﬁ  rmed the date.
Sarah still has trouble talking about the or-
deal.
“This is the reason why girls don’t report 
things,” she said.
…
Sarah has no memory of her assault. She 
said she was in a blackout, but there is no way to know for sure what caused her memory lapse.A doctor, Elliot Michael Reisman, said 
there are three “real, honest possibilities.”
One, her blood sugar got too low, and she 
was delirious. 
Two, she had too much to drink and 
doesn’t remember it. 
Three, psychologically she just blocked it 
out — “which is a perfectly normal and rea-sonable thing to do if you’ve been raped.”
Reisman said it’s impossible to know what 
really happened.
 There are too many variables: what she 
ate, what she drank, how much insulin she administered to herself that day.
Sarah will never know exactly what hap-
pened that night. She’ll never know with cer-tainty why she blacked out.
According to Laura Templeton, a victim 
advocate for University Police, none of that matters. Regardless of the cause of the black-out, it still constitutes rape.
Florida Statute 794.011 (e) states that sexual 
battery occurs when a victim is “physically helpless.” 
It deﬁ  nes this state as “unconscious, asleep, 
or for any other reason physically unable to communicate unwillingness to an act.”
“If you feel like this happened, it hap-
pened,” Templeton said. “It says in the laws that if you’re under the inﬂ  uence of alcohol, you can’t consent.”
She said the interactions she has had with 
Gainesville Police and University Police have 
been positive.
“We’re lucky that we’ve experienced really 
good, positive feedback from survivors about 
their experiences with our ofﬁ  cers,” Temple-ton said.
She said she has “heard stuff” from other 
victim advocates about law enforcement, court systems and some judges.
“That’s part of prepping victims who are 
coming forward to report,” Templeton said. “You want to make sure they know up front what they’re getting into, and part of that is knowing the system.”
She added she knows victim blaming by 
ofﬁ  cials can happen, especially when there is alcohol involved.
“There’s not a barrier between rape culture 
and law enforcement,” she said. “It’s every-
where.”Rape culture can lead to issues for victims reporting to police
Lost memory, ﬁ  les mean mystery
According to www.rainn.org, the site for the Rape, Abuse and Incest National 
Network, sexual assault is one of the most underreported crimes.
Out of every 100  rapes,
 46 are reported to police
  of those, 12 lead to arrest
    9 get prosecuted
     5 lead to felony conviction
To report a rape to the police, a person (or his/her friend) can call 911 or visit an emergency room 
and ask them to call. The number to connect to the local rape crisis center is 1-800-656-HOPE.Reader response

like a Kardashian — on purpose? Today’s question: Should the United States go to war 
with Syria?Support for impeaching Obama is cheap
The authority to impeach the president of the United 
States is one of the most seldom-used powers granted to Congress by the Constitution.
The Constitution states that presidents and other ofﬁ  -
cials can only be impeached on the basis of “high crimes 
and misdemeanors.”  These violations include bribery, per-
jury, treason and a number of other very serious offenses.
The process of impeachment is long and difﬁ  cult, which 
reﬂ  ects the very speciﬁ  c and serious circumstances when it can be used. Impeachment requires a majority vote in the House to begin proceedings and a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict the president and remove him or her from ofﬁ  ce.  
In the 237 years since America’s founding, only two of 
America’s 44 presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson, for violating the Tenure of Ofﬁ  ce Act, and Bill Clinton, for committing perjury during the Monica Lewin-sky scandal. A third president, Richard Nixon, likely would have been impeached by Congress in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, but he resigned before proceedings could begin.
No president has ever been successfully removed from 
ofﬁ  ce, however — both Johnson and Clinton narrowly 
avoided conviction by the Senate.
Despite the weighty implications of supporting the im-
peachment of a president, some congressional Republicans 
have recently rallied enthusiastically around the prospect of impeaching President Barack Obama.
“If I could write that bill and submit it, it would be a 
dream come true,” said Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-MI), ac-cording to The New York Times.
The Times also quoted Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), who 
recently said the president was “perilously close” to being in danger of impeachment.
So, what high crimes has Obama committed to deserve 
impeachment and removal from ofﬁ  ce?
As of now, none of the Republicans supporting Obama’s 
impeachment have come forward with any evidence of criminal activity or misconduct that would justify such an act.Instead, they frequently cite 
the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — a piece of legislation that was ruled fully lawful and constitutional by the 
Supreme Court. The recent IRS 
“scandal” involving alleged in-creased scrutiny for conservative political action groups, which has also been thoroughly debunked, is 
another popular source of outrage for impeachment-happy Republicans.
Ironically, actions taken by the Obama administration 
that some consider unlawful, including the warrantless 
data collecting conducted by the National Security Admin-
istration, are never mentioned by Republicans supporting the president’s impeachment. This is likely because these Republicans are more interested in scoring cheap political points than they are in contributing constructively to public policy.  
Essentially, the motivation for impeaching the presi-
dent for these Republicans is: “He doesn’t share our views, and we don’t like that.” Unfortunately for them, that is not 
nearly enough of a reason to even consider supporting im-
peachment.
These Republicans may also be suffering from what 
some, including journalist and author Jonathan Alter, have called “Obama Derangement Syndrome.” The Republicans who support Obama’s impeachment are so blinded by their hatred for the president that they are willing to say or do anything simply to display their distaste for him.
It would be a political disaster for Republicans to im-
peach Obama and then provide no evidence to support their actions. Even if such a bill were to pass in the Repub-lican-dominated House, the prospects of conviction in the Democratic-held Senate are essentially zero.
The talk of impeachment coming from congressional Re-
publicans is likely just that: all talk.

junior. His column runs on Wednesdays. Not So Fast: 
Ranking system 
needs to be examined
Yesterday, we reported that UF had shifted upward in the U.S. News & World Report’s university rankings. Among public universities, we are now 14, and among 
national universities, we are 49. Damn, it feels good to be a Gator.
Consider, however, that the U.S. News & World Report’s 
questionable methodology for ranking universities in Ameri-ca has been criticized since the early ‘80s.
During a lecture on Aug. 22 at the University at Buffalo, 
The State University of New York, President Barack Obama even commented on U.S. News’ faulty rankings.
“It encourages a lot of colleges to focus on ways to . . . game 
the numbers, and it actually rewards them, in some cases, for raising costs,” he said.
In addition, a large part of the metrics — about 22.5 to 25 
percent — used to determine rank comes from a “reputation-al” measure that doesn’t rely on hard data. The U.S. News re-quests “peer assessments” from college presidents, provosts, admissions directors and high school counselors.
But is there any value in asking the president of the Univer-
sity of California, Irvine, a large state school, to assess Yeshiva University, a small, private Jewish university with two cam-puses in Manhattan? The U.S. News ratings are, as Malcolm 
Gladwell of the New Yorker put it, a “self-fulﬁ  lling proph-
ecy,” because the school ofﬁ  cials who complete these peer assessments often return to U.S. News’ previous rankings to form their opinions. This ﬂ  awed system results in a higher-education beauty pageant worthy of a TLC reality show.
As The Atlantic writer John Tierney put it, the U.S. News 
ranking only serves to further our cultural obsession with prestige, even if the supposed prestige is based solely on dol-lars spent rather than the quality of education.
All this considered, we urge you — and high school stu-
dents, parents and alumni — to avoid placing too much weight on this particular ranking, especially since other high-er-quality rankings actually place UF even higher.
Washington Monthly released its 2013 national universities 
ranking, and UF placed 24th. This list includes both public and for-proﬁ  t schools, so this represents a noticeable shift from our slot at 49 on the U.S. News ranking.
The Washington Monthly bases its comparisons on each 
school’s “contribution to the public good in three broad cat-egories.” These categories included social mobility, research and service. Social mobility refers to a university’s capacity for recruiting and graduating low-income students, research refers to universities that provide the best scholarship oppor-tunities and Ph.D. programs, and service applies to universi-ties that encourage their students to give something back to the country. Y’know, the things that matter more than reno-vated dorms and high ratings in arbitrary categories such as 
“selectivity.”
This year, Washington Monthly also released its ﬁ  rst-ev-
er Best Bang For Your Buck schools — with UF in the No. 1 
spot.

Recent debate over American military 
intervention in Syria has sparked Cold War memories, and the parallels 
are stark. As I watched a discussion between Sen. John McCain and French writer Bernard 
Henri-Lévy at a Washington think tank on 
YouTube from November, this resemblance became apparent.
In a moment of 
supreme irony, in regards to Syria, the moderator declared, “If the French are ready to go, we 
should go. That’s my rule of thumb in for-
eign policy.”
As if he did not realize that the man he 
was speaking to, Sen. John McCain, spent more than ﬁ  ve years of his youth interned by a country initially imperialized by France and later invaded by the United States.  
It’s practically a given that the Cold War 
of the 20th century was, to put it bluntly, stu-
pid. That is, motivated by false fears and as-
sumptions, and responsible for reprehensible quantities of violence and trauma. Therefore, in making the argument for a strong resem-blance between U.S. involvement in Syria and Vietnam, I aim to invigorate the histori-cal anxieties of unjust wars past.
At the geopolitical level, former Cold War 
hegemons, China and Russia, stand ﬁ  rmly 
opposed to U.S. intervention — just as they 
were opposed to U.S. intervention in an al-ready deteriorating French conﬂ  ict in Indo-china during the Vietnam War.
At a strategic level, as in the case of Viet-
nam, the conﬂ  ict in Syria poses no existential threat to the United States.
However, in his Aug. 31 speech from the 
White House Rose Garden, President Barack 
Obama said, “I believe I have the authority to 
carry out this military action without speciﬁ  c congressional authorization.”
If the president believes he has the au-
thority to bomb a sovereign state without the consent of our elected representatives, then must he not also believe the Syrian conﬂ  ict poses a direct threat to the common defense or general welfare of the United States, thus 
warranting a hasty and unapproved attack?
On a moral level, it is ridiculous to sup-
pose more violence from an external force 
can help produce justice in Syria. Yet, Presi-dent Obama speaks in the language of jus-tice.
He said, “I’m conﬁ  dent we can hold the 
Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons, deter this kind of be-
havior and degrade their capacity to carry it 
out.”
Flipping the situation on its head helps 
highlight the absurdity of this reasoning. Imagine a contemporary American civil war. Regardless of the motivating factors for such an event, would any American think for a second it would be acceptable for the Syrian government to impose its self-proclaimed 
“just will” on our domestic conﬂ  ict? The re-
verse is no different, and it is the situation we face.
Former Secretary of Defense Robert 
McNamara said it best, “The picture of the world’s greatest superpower killing or seri-ously injuring 1,000 noncombatants a week, while trying to pound a tiny backward na-tion into submission on an issue whose mer-
its are hotly disputed, is not a pretty one.”

Speaking OutBy noon, a third of the class was gone. As the 
minutes passed, more kids in my fourth grade 
class were being pulled out by panicky par-
ents. During lunch, the few of us remaining were confused. The rumor in the cafeteria was that the Chinese had attacked us. The idea of the Commies invading U.S. soil made sense to my 9-year-old mind. Earlier that year, an international crisis had occurred after a mid-air collision between a U.S. Navy plane and a Chinese ﬁ  ghter jet. Diplomatic tensions soon subsided, but sitting in the cafeteria, I ﬁ  gured the only thing that could force my buddies to evacuate our elementary school was a ground invasion of South Florida by the Red Army.
Twelve years since that day, it’s easy to laugh at my childish 
notions. But aside from whatever story we all remember from Sept. 
11, 2001, today’s anniversary brings painful memories to many. The terrorist attacks that morning caused 2,977 individuals to leave this world. The daughters and sons, the widows and widowers of those victims ﬁ  nd restless hearts when they recall 9/11 — and so should we.
Immediately after 9/11, candlelight vigils and other solidarity 
events were held in the Muslim world expressing grief over the loss 
of innocent American life. In Iran — yet to be included in President 
George W. Bush’s “axis of evil” at the time — an entire soccer sta-dium observed a minute of silence honoring the dead. If that wasn’t enough to break the stereotype that all Muslims were terror lovers, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat expressed horror at the crimes, and even the Ayatollah of Iran condemned the suicide attacks. For a moment, the headline of the French daily Le Monde spoke for the world: “Nous sommes tous Americains” — “We are all Ameri-cans.”
Humanity held its breath, hoping America would grasp the 
mantle of moral leadership. But we lost it. We fell for our politi-cians’ war drums, and we lost it. We toppled the Afghan govern-ment and militarily occupied the country instead of using the less-dramatic and more logical approach of criminally investigating the organizers and ﬁ  nanciers of the isolated terrorist net-works. Our response to foreign violence with Ameri-can violence had just begun.
In September 2002, the Bush administration re-
leased its National Security Strategy. If the NSS had 
anything to do with “national security,” we would 
have world peace today. The NSS called for action against countries before said countries could even threaten the U.S. with weapons of mass destruction. In proclaiming such a vague defense policy, much of 
the world could be labeled a “security threat.” 
We went for oil-rich Iraq, with nearly 70  percent of Ameri-
cans convinced that Saddam Hussein was somehow “personally involved” in the 9/11 attacks. Bush’s favorite philosopher said in 
the Gospels, “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take 
the sword will perish by the sword.” Jesus didn’t predict modern America’s lack of ethical insight, but his teaching that violence be-gets violence remains true today.
American obsession with violence and hostility as tools to deal 
with 21st century problems hasn’t changed much in recent years. Sure, we got out of Iraq, but we replaced that with hundreds of Yemeni and Pakistani civilians being killed in drone strikes ordered by the Obama administration. We continue to occupy Afghanistan, 
and now the war drums for striking Syria are beating loud.
The U.S. somehow manages to detain more than a hundred men 
without trial at Guantanamo —  about half of them cleared for re-
lease — and force-feed dozens of others. In 2012, former President Jimmy Carter called our bipartisan disregard for human rights since 9/11 a “cruel and unusual record.” Milton Friedman once said, “Governments never learn. Only people learn.” Are we going to do anything about the moral decline of U.S. foreign policy? Or should we pray, as Pope Francis did in a four-hour public vigil last 
Saturday, pleading for divine aid to pull us out of the “spiral of sor-
row and death?” Remember, humanity can only hold its breath for so long, so let’s get the ball rolling.

Although the mood in the 
Chesterfield Smith Classroom in 
the Levin College of Law turned comical as Tuesday’s Student Senate meeting was briefly inter-
rupted by a shirtless student play-
ing the saxophone for a promo video for Gator Growl, rhetoric stiffened with discussion of party neutrality.
Senate President Lauren Verno 
personally asked senators to leave buttons, T-shirts and any political party paraphernalia behind dur-ing the upcoming election sea-son.
“I consider these chambers to 
be very unbiased,” she said.
In her past three years as a sen-
ator, Verno remembered tensions rising as students seemingly cam-paigned during Senate meetings.
“I really want this to feel like 
Senate and not two separate cham-bers,” she said after the meeting.
Sen. Helie Dharia took her Stu-
dents Party pin off her purse and reversed her Students Party T-shirt for Tuesday’s meeting.“We don’t want to cause prob-
lems,” she said after the meeting. “We want to be productive.”
Swamp Party Spokesman Jo-
seph Michaels said senators with-in his party are discouraged from 
wearing anything distracting in 
Senate.
“Those in Senate are reminded 
that their job is to represent stu-dents,” he said.
As the Senate eases into elec-
tion season, the second day of qualifying for Fall 2013 elections surpassed Monday’s numbers. 
After a record low turnout Mon-

A small crowd gathered on the front steps 
of Tigert Hall on Monday in response to UF 
failing to pay 60 to 80 graduate assistants.
Members in Graduate Assistants United, 
the labor union representing all graduate as-
sistants at UF, believe the main cause is a back-
log of paperwork due to an overwhelmed ad-ministration staff.
“With so many new employees, it’s not un-
usual to have these kinds of pay delays in the Fall semester,” said UF spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes.
Sikes said if students are late in being hired 
by their department or miss a deadline for 
whatever reason, they won’t be processed in UF’s system and could be unpaid.
Last year, UF took administration staff out 
of different departments and funneled them into a shared services office where graduate assistants could be processed in a single place, 
said Graduate Assistants United grievance 
chairman Kevin Funk, a doctoral candidate in political science.The college “can’t definitively prove to you 
that it’s causing a problem, but common sense would indicate that factor,” said Funk, 31.
Graduate assistants who weren’t paid last 
Friday are eligible to receive an emergency check this Friday. They must request an emer-gency check from their individual department 
and have the request submitted to payroll be-
fore 4 p.m. today, according to an email pro-vided by UF Graduate School.
Emily McCann, chief negotiator and co-
president of Graduate Assistants United said graduate assistants fear they may remain un-paid or unappreciated, for their work.
“We’re troubled that UF knew about this 
problem before and didn’t do anything about 
it,” the 28-year-old English doctoral candidate 
said. “But, this year, we’ve decided to take ac-tion.”Graduate assistants protest lack of paychecks due to paperwork

BUT ARE RESPECTFUL.
STAFF REPORT
It was Sept. 11, 2001, and 
Kevin Weschler was excited.
What fourth-grader getting 
out of school early on his birth-
day wouldn’t be? He didn’t 
even know what the Twin 
Towers were. 
Now, 12 years later, We-
schler celebrates — carefully.
“I try to have a good time 
while still recognizing ... that day,” said the 22-year-old UF industrial and systems engi-neering senior.
He’s not alone. Likely due to 
it falling roughly nine months after New Year’s Day and Val-entine’s Day, Sept. 16 is  the most common birthday in the United States. Being born near that date — including Sept. 11 — is extremely common.
Andrea Sarcos, a 21-year-
old UF visual art studies ju-nior, remembers Sept. 11, 2001, as a good birthday. Her par-ents threw a pool party with a bounce house.
But as she grew older, she 
felt the tension.
“I was kind of selfish,” Sar-
cos said. “I kind of ignored 
whatever was going on. It was 
hard to feel happy when every-one around you was sad.”
That reaction isn’t uncom-
mon. On her 10th birthday, Stephanie Trappberger’s friends kept coming up to her and saying, “I’m sorry.”
The 22-year-old UF animal 
sciences senior said on Sept. 11, 2001, she went out with her family to a seafood restaurant. They were the only customers.
“It was a normal day before 
it happened,” Trappberger said. “As time went on and the 
older I got, now I really know 
the significance of the day.”
She celebrates her birthday 
like normal, but she remembers what happened that day.
“It’s still in the back of my 
mind,” Trappberger said.
Similarly, now that she’s 
older, Sarcos said, she feels a 
sense of tribute on the day.
“I respect it,” she said. “I’ll 
think about it. I’m just more 
aware.”
But really, those with 9/11 
birthdays can’t seem to forget it.
Trappberger, Weschler and 
Sarcos all said when they tell 
friends their birth date, many 
react with surprise.
“I’ve never gotten anyone 
who’s like ‘Oh, cool,’” Sarcos said. “More like ‘Are you seri-ous?’ or, ‘Are you lying?’”
Each year, when the day 
itself comes, the students are challenged to strike a balance 
between somber remembrance 
and personal celebration.
“I separate 9/11 and my 
birthday in my mind as two separate concepts,” Weschler said. “I think of ‘9/11’ as a tragedy, and I think of Septem-ber 11th as my birthday. Even though it happened to be si-
multaneous.”9/11 babies used

A local HIV advocacy group received renewed funding 
last week, so it can begin offering meetings outside of Alachua 
County.
The advocacy group, Let’s Talk About It, is a program of-
fered by local nonprofit organization Rural Women’s Health 
Project. The group offers HIV-positive women of North Cen-
tral Florida support and health education.
Previously, the program only offered meetings in Alachua 
County. With the new funding, Let’s Talk About It will be able to provide meetings in Marion and Putnam counties, said An-gela Bakidis, project coordinator for the program.
Jean, a 61-year-old HIV-positive woman from Levy County, 
was one of the first to join the advocacy program. Before join-ing Let’s Talk About It, she was a member of an online support group, which had taken her a year and a half to find.
Women try very hard to make it to meetings, she said.“There’s some that rode a bus. There’s one that’s a student 
that rides a bicycle,” she said.
However, many women stop attending because transporta-
tion is difficult, she said. And some women have young chil-dren they can’t leave alone for long.
Robin Lewy, director of education at the Rural Women’s 
Health Project, said Let’s Talk About It currently has about 30 members who attend the meetings, but at least 120 women par-ticipate in the program through its self-titled magazine.
Lewy said she hopes  more women will come to meetings 
when it is easier to attend.
Jean said talking with other HIV-positive women about 
their experiences helped with her depression.
“It’s like being on a deserted island,” she said. “No one else 
can understand it except someone else going through it.”HIV advocacy group to expand beyond Alachua County“With so many new employees,

Mitzvah Marathon from 11 a.m. to 
3 p.m. on Turlington Plaza.
The intention of the marathon is to bring the UF community to-gether to create an atmosphere of remembrance and selflessness, ac-cording to a news release.
“In high school, you wear a pa-
triotic pin and go to an assembly, but in college, it kind of passes you by,” said Aviela Weltman, social actions committee director of the Lubavitch-Chabad Student Group. “Taking the pledge grounds stu-dents by helping the community.”
People will choose from a list 
of good deeds and pledge to com-plete them in honor of 9/11 heroes and victims. 
These will be hung on a wall 
connecting models of the Twin Towers.  
Saiyng Lin, a UF marketing se-

A recent case study conduct-
ed by three Mayo Clinic doc-
tors suggests that young people who have overcome obesity in the past are at a higher risk of 
developing eating disorders, 
and some locals are weighing in to confirm the data.
According to the study, 
published in the journal Pedi-atrics, a majority of adolescents who were diagnosed with eat-ing disorders — typically bu-limia or anorexia — also had a 
history of obesity.
Cathy Owen, a social work-
er at the UF Counseling and 
Wellness Center, said the ex-planation for these cases may trace back to a root problem: negative body image.
“Whether it’s alcohol, drugs 
or repetitive kinds of behav-
iors, in a way, it really becomes 
a way of coping with underly-ing emotional distress,” said Owen.
The condition can be deceit-
ful because friends and family, and even doctors, likely won’t recognize the problem. In two cases cited in the study, there 
was no early detection.
The girl in one of the cases 
was classified as obese when 
she was 12. She received nu-tritional and medical advice, adopted a 1,500-calorie diet and strict exercise regime, and dropped about 80 pounds.
It wasn’t until her mother started noticing signs of poor nutrition, stress fractures, fa-tigue and menstrual problems, among other issues, that the girl got help for an eating dis-order.
It’s a concern for local stu-
dents, too.
In a 2010 survey of UF stu-
dents, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 8 men reported that feeling fat frequently interfered with their everyday happiness. One in 6 students worried about losing control over how much they 
ate.
Jose Garcia, a 23-year-old 
UF political science senior, 
said he knew eating disorders were prevalent, but he said he wouldn’t know where to start looking for help.
“My first thought would be 
the hospital, but what would 
I do?” he said. “Go up to the 
counter and say, ‘I think my friend has an eating disor-der’?”
One thing to remember, 
Owen said, when confronting someone you are concerned about is to go about it in an open manner.
UF’s Counseling and Well-
ness Center offers individual and group counseling for eating disorders and body image is-sues, including a weekly group Making Peace with Food.
“As families and commu-
nities, we can start supporting these vulnerable kids and chal-
lenging our society’s message, 
too,” Owen said.Beating obesity can 
lead to eating disorders
CRIME 
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
A former deputy fired an accidental shot 
Tuesday evening after a Keystone Heights 
man tried to steal his lawn mower.
Officers charged William Brislan Mel-
colm, 46, with aggravated assault, theft 
and burglary, according to an arrest re-
port.
At about 3 p.m., retired ASO Deputy David Ryan Cox saw Melcolm taking his lawn mower, valued at $300, out of a cov-ered parking area and putting it in the 
bed of Melcom’s truck, according to the 
report.
Cox walked into the street to confront 
Melcolm, who accelerated his car at Cox, according to the report. Cox jumped out of the way and lost his balance, accidentally firing a gun he had. The shot hit the tail-gate of Melcolm’s truck, according to an email from GPD Spokesman Of-
ficer Ben Tobias.
Two witnesses saw 
Melcolm driving away, 
and one identified Mel-
colm as the man Cox de-scribed, according to the 
report.During an interview with police, Mel-
colm admitted to the attempted theft. He also told police he was unemployed and 
needed money and food. He said he accel-
erated because he panicked, according to the report.
Officers booked Melcom into the Ala-
chua County Jail at about 7:30 p.m., where he remained Tuesday night with a $40,000 bond. Retired ASO deputy gets fired up about $300 lawn mower
� THEY ARE PRIVATELY 
FUNDED.

Though some public universities 
have allowed religion-based dorms 
to be constructed on their campus-es, students shouldn’t expect to see them at UF anytime soon.
“There is no interest in building 
faith-based housing on the UF cam-pus at this time,” Sharon Blansett, UF Housing and Residence Edu-cation spokeswoman, wrote in an 
email.
However, Blansett said UF Hous-
ing respects religious beliefs and will 
continue to explore student interest in potential new Living Learning Communities.
Some colleges have already en-
tertained the idea.
The Wall Street Journal reported 
that religion-based dorms have been privately funded for construction at some public universities.These schools include Texas 
A&M University-Kingsville, Uni-versity of Nebraska-Lincoln and most recently, Troy University in Alabama.
According to the article, the new-est hall at Troy forbids alcohol use for residents, even if they are 21 years or older.
The hall also has a chapel, and 
residents can participate in group Bible study.
The faith-based dorms were built 
to unite religious students under one roof, particularly to avoid a party-centric residential experience.
The halls are funded by private 
institutions such as the Newman 
Student Housing Fund, which has 
constructed the halls on campus at Texas A&M-Kingsville and the Flor-ida Institute of Technology.
Samantha Farmand, director of 
development for Catholic Gators, 
said religion-based housing might 
be a good way for students to share their faith with one another.
Felix Bartsch, a 22-year-old UF-
neurobiological sciences senior, said faith-based halls would not promote diversity. With so many students on campus, he said those who come to a public school should expect to come 
across people with different beliefs.
“I’m in favor of getting anyone 
out of their comfort zone,” he said.
Faith-based dorms at some public universities, not in UF’s beliefsLIFESTYLE
“There is no interest in 
building faith-based housing 
on the UF campus at this 
time.”

Gators recruiting
According to multiple reports, Class of 2013 offensive 
lineman Ben Knox decommitted from Florida on Tuesday. Rivals.com rates Knox a three-star prospect.Poll question
Will Gators quarterback Jeff Driskel play in every game this season? Vote online at alligatorSports.org.Florida goalkeeper Taylor Burke has not allowed a goal in the month of September. Read the story on page 16.ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
Jeff Driskel’s redemption was imminent. 
The junior signal-caller had failed to get 
Florida’s offense through the red zone and into the promised land — the end zone — for most of the game against Miami.
With fewer than 7 minutes on the clock and 
the Gators down by five points, Driskel was poised to lead a fourth-quarter comeback and win the game.
But it was not meant to be.Driskel rolled out of the pocket to his right 
and tried to force the ball through traffic to wide receiver Quinton Dunbar. Instead, he found Miami cornerback Tracy Howard, who returned the interception 36 yards to the Mi-ami 48-yard line.
“It was just a bad call on my part,” Driskel said. “He’s covered. Either throw the ball away or try to pick up the first down with your feet.”
Driskel’s interception was the last of No. 18 
Florida’s (1-1) failures in the red zone in its 21-16 loss to No. 15 Miami (2-0) on Saturday in Sun Life Stadium. The Gators scored on only two of six drives when they advanced inside the Hurricane’s 20-yard line. 
“You’ve got to go down there and get 
points,” coach Will Muschamp said after the game. “If you end every possession with a kick, you’ll win a bunch of games. We didn’t do that.”
Three of those deep drives ended in Florida 
turnovers on Saturday. In addition to his in-terception late in the fourth quarter, Driskel threw a pick at the start of the second quarter 
when the Gators were on the Hurricanes’ 11-
yard line.
Even when he did not commit an official 
turnover via a fumble or interception, Driskel had a hard time in the red zone. 
He was 2 for 5 on the day when attempt-
ing passes inside the 20-yard line, throwing for 7 total yards and tossing two interceptions. However, the junior did manage to run for 11 
yards and a touchdown on three attempts.
Driskel also failed to convert on a fourth-
and-1 play at the Miami 16-yard line, ending a 
Florida drive that could have leveled the score at 14 if the series continued or brought the Gators within five points of tying the game if Muschamp had opted for a field goal.
“We had confidence in our O-line that we 
could get a push,” Driskel said. “On that play, Miami did a great job of really stuffing every hole. Sometimes the defense beats you.”
After the game, Muschamp took the blame 
for the play call, saying that he believed Flori-da needed a touchdown in the situation.Driskel was not the only player with costly 
turnovers in the red zone.
With Florida driving down field at the end 
of the first half, Driskel found senior receiver Trey Burton on a first-down pass. Burton then coughed the ball up when Shayon Green tack-led him. Miami recovered the loose ball and ended the half.
“That’s not really who we are,” Burton 
said. “We work a lot on turnovers. A lot of protecting the ball.
The Gators’ failures in the red zone on Sat-
urday were unlike a team that is usually pro-ficient at scoring when deep in the opponent’s territory.
In 2012, Florida finished 50th in the coun-
try in red-zone conversions, scoring on 82.6 percent of trips inside the 20. Even though the 
Gators only scored touchdowns on 52 percent 
of those attempts, former kicker Caleb Sturgis made sure UF came away with points, kick-ing field goals on about 30 percent of red-zone drives.
Florida performed well inside the 20-yard 
line in its season opener against Toledo. The Gators scored on four of their six red-zone drives against the Rockets, coming away with 
touchdowns on three of the drives and kicking 
a field goal on another.
The only times when Florida did not come 
away with points were on a missed field goal by redshirt freshman Austin Hardin and when the Gators ran out the clock to end the game.
They did not turn the ball over in the red 
zone.
But after Florida’s poor performance on 
Saturday, it fell to 117th in the nation in red-zone efficiency. 
“We’ve just go to play smart football,” 
Muschamp said. “In those critical situations, you’re taking points off the board.”

Although it may seem as if 
Florida was run out of the gym 
by then-No. 1 Penn State on Sun-
day, there were enough positives 
to leave the Gators optimistic moving forward.  
“We talked to the team about 
the great experience for us to play such a good Penn State team,” coach Mary Wise said.  
“The separator was the serv-
ing-passing battle … The beauty 
of volleyball is that these are just matches  
that help 
us for the 
long run.”
The No. 5 Gators pulled off 
an upset of then-No. 2 Stanford on Saturday in four sets (28–26, 
25–17, 18-25, 25–22). Unfortunately for Florida, that 
effored was followed by a sweep at the hands of Penn State (25-18, 
25-17, 25–20).
Playing against the top-two 
teams in the nation displayed weapons that will be instrumen-
tal for the Gators during the rest of the season. 
The biggest factor in each of 
the two weekend matches was Si-
mone Antwi.  
Antwi, a middle blocker, led 
the team against Stanford with a .706 hitting percentage on 13 Play of middle blocker will prove critical to Gators’ successRed-Zone Drives Against Miami

The ﬁ  nal round of the Cougar Classic was 
successful for Florida. 
Entering Tuesday, the Gators faced an 
11-stroke deﬁ  cit. 
But after a furious rally, Florida (-5)  came 
away with the team victory and individual 
title for junior Anna Young (-5).
The Gators needed help heading into the 
third round after Clemson’s (-4) impressive 
second day elevated it to the lead. 
That’s exactly what Florida got. Clemson struggled, going 5-over par as a 
team in the ﬁ  nal round after recording a 6-un-der par score — tied for the second lowest score of the tournament — on Monday.
Mississippi State (+7), the ﬁ  rst-round lead-
er, had trouble with a 10-over-par third round, dropping the Bulldogs from second to ﬁ  fth.
No. 10 Florida showed its poise by capi-
talizing on the mistakes, registering 18 bird-ies and a tournament-best 7-under-par round 
while making its climb up the leaderboard.
Facing a large deﬁ  cit, UF had two players 
shoot lower than 69 on the par-72 Yeamans Hall course.
Young made ﬁ  ve birdies, including the 18th 
hole, and did not shoot over par once en route 
to scoring a 67 on Tuesday — the third low-est single round score of the tournament. She 
played a key role in the Gators’ 7-under-par 
performance that lifted them from ﬁ  fth to ﬁ  rst and brought her name from 16th to the top of the individual leaderboard.
She was not the only Gator to play well in 
the third round. Karolina Vlckova notched a 68, bringing her just outside the top-ﬁ  ve, ﬁ  n-ishing tied for sixth. Her six birdies against two bogeys was her best performance of the 
tournament, making more birdies in one day 
than she had in the previous two rounds com-bined.
Camilla Hedberg also had her best round 
with a 74, and Katie Mitchell held par for the 
second day in a row. 
However, freshman Maria Torres strug-
gled. She was leading the Gators at 3-under 
par after two rounds and tied for third when 
she shot 4-over par on the front nine, double 
bogeying the ninth hole. She managed par on the back nine with two birdies and two bo-geys, keeping her at 76 on the day.Gators rally in ﬁ  nal round to secure win at Cougar Classic

columnists will debate the biggest 
looming matchup in college football. Today, Joe Morgan and Phil Heilman 
preview No. 1 Alabama’s showdown 
against No. 7 Texas A&M in College Station, Texas, on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. on CBS.
Joe: Give Nick Saban two weeks 
to do anything, and he’ll own you.
Plan a wedding? Imagine a 
small ceremony at a beach with 
family and close friends. Cue 
sunset the moment the bride and groom begin reciting their vows. 
Also, no sand in the cake.
Build a spaceship? He would 
captain the ﬁ  rst manned mission to every planet in our solar system 
and build powerhouse football programs on each one. Jupiter Crimson Spot, anyone?
Solve the crisis in Syria? 
Why hasn’t President Barack 
Obama called him yet?
Simply put, Saban is the 
best at what he does. Ninety-
nine percent of the time, he is untouchable. 
With two weeks and and 
a whole offseason to prepare, he is 
lethal.
Kevin Sumlin is a coaching 
mastermind with 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel at 
his disposal, but Saban’s methods of preparation and planning are 
elite.
There’s no shame in falling to 
Alabama, and Texas A&M will 
have to take solace in that.Phil: You said it perfectly your-
self, Joe. Saban is untouchable 99 
percent of the time. 
Dominating on the recruiting 
trail? Untouchable. 
Winning enough national 
championships to create a dynas-
ty? Untouchable. 
Escaping the NFL to return to a 
prestigious college program? Un-
touchable. 
However, there is that one per-cent of the time that Saban has 
proven to be beatable, and it has manifested itself as John-ny Football. 
Johnny Football is every-
thing and nothing you would 
want in a quarterback. 
He draws attention to him-
self for the wrong reasons — taunting opponents, ignoring 
coaches and holding loose morals off the ﬁ  eld.
But, on the ﬂ  ipside, he is mo-
bile, athletic and equally strong-armed and strong-willed. 
He showed that against the 
Crimson Tide last season, going into Tuscaloosa and handing Ala-
bama its only loss of the season 
with a performance that catapult-
ed him into the Heisman Trophy conversation.
Will he go 2 for 2 in beating Sa-
ban? You bet your Texas-sized ass he will.
Joe: Fool Saban once, shame 
on you. Fool him twice? Yeah, 
right. Alabama will not drop two 
straight against Texas A&M.
After the Aggies’ monstrous 
ﬁ  rst quarter in last year’s contest, 
the Crimson Tide buckled down and got back on track.
Texas A&M jumped out to a 
20-0 lead, but Alabama outscored Sumlin’s team 24-9 the rest of the way.
Manziel tallied 82 yards on nine 
carries during the ﬁ  rst half but managed only 10 yards on nine second-half carries. ‘Bama bottled him up.
A combination of in-game ad-
justments and Alabama’s prowess 
had the Tide 2 yards away from 
the go-ahead touchdown with 1:36 left in the fourth quarter.
Saban will not let his team start 
that slow again, and I’m not sure the Aggies can pull off the win if 
‘Bama doesn’t spot them 20 points 
this time around.
Maybe I should have spotted 
you a few points in this Rally, bud.
Phil: It’s unfair to discount 
what the Aggies were able to do in the ﬁ  rst quarter while patting the 
Crimson Tide on the back for what 
they did later in the game. 
Points count the same no mat-
ter if they are scored in the ﬁ  rst drive or the last drive — just ask 
the Gators about that.
If you look beyond the box 
score, you will see Texas A&M 
scored 20 points in the ﬁ  rst quar-ter before Alabama stabilized and 
scored two straight touchdowns in 
the second quarter.
But from there, each team 
scored a touchdown and added a ﬁ  eld goal. That is not exactly dom-
ination. 
Manziel was limited on the 
ground in the second half, but he ﬁ  nished the game a cool 24 of 31 
for 253 yards passing with two touchdowns and no picks. He is 
the prototypical dual-threat gun-
slinger.
But enough with last season. 
Let’s look at the two teams as cur-rently constituted.
Alabama brings back senior 
quarterback A.J. McCarron and sophomore tailback T.J. Yeldon. Other than that, not much is the 
same. 
The offensive line is weaker, 
and the Crimson Tide defense has 
question marks. I will be surprised if Alabama can win in the trenches as consistently as it did last sea-son. 
Meanwhile, Manziel has a full 
season in the Texas A&M offense and a bevy of playmakers sur-
rounding him on offense. 
Defensively, the Aggies will get 
three previously suspended play-
ers back for the game. 
With its defense intact, an of-
fense capable of scoring 30 points 
and the 12th man in full force, the 
Aggies will be riding high in Col-lege Station this weekend. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

THE RALLY
Who will win the Texas A&M-Alabama matchup on Saturday?
Kan Li / Alligator Staff
Simone Antwi jumps for the ball during Florida’s 3-0 victory against New 
Orleans on Aug. 30 in the O’Connell Center. UF is 5-1 this season.
Florida will play in the Active 
Ankle Challenge this weekend 
kills.
But the sophomore notched only ﬁ  ve kills 
on a .133 hitting percentage against Penn State 
on Sunday.
“Simone Antwi really had a breakout on 
Saturday,” Wise said. “Her best match by far 
as a Gator.”  
Having Antwi as a fourth option behind se-
nior middle blocker Chloe Mann, sophomore outside hitter Ziva Recek and freshman right-side hitter Alex Holston could elevate Florida to the next level. 
At 6-foot-2, Antwi is tied with Mann and 
sophomore outside hitter Gabby Mallette as the tallest player on the Gators — a trait that is important for UF’s style of play.
Her height may be the determining factor in her role as the season progresses as sopho-more Noami Santos-Lamb continues to rehab from an ACL injury that sidelined her for the 
entire 2012 season. 
The theme of the season moving forward 
will be how the Gators develop a successful 
formula with all of the new talent on the ros-ter. 
“The win on Saturday does not deﬁ  ne the 
weekend, nor does the loss on Sunday,” Wise said.  
“What deﬁ  nes the weekend is what we 
learned from it and how much better we are moving from this point forward.” 
UF will get another home weekend tourna-
ment, the Active Ankle Challenge, to reﬁ  ne 
some of its weaknesses that were displayed 
against Penn State. 
 Florida’s ﬁ  rst match is against Georgetown 
on Friday at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.VOLLEY , from page 13

Taylor Burke has been unbeat-
able in the net during September.
Since Florida lost 3-0 to Florida 
State on Aug. 30, the junior goal-
keeper has posted three consecu-tive shutouts. The streak is nothing new for Burke, who has not allowed a goal since Oregon State’s Chelsea 
Buckland beat her on Aug. 25.
“We’re fortunate that goalkeep-
ing is one of the biggest strengths 
of our team,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
Burke began 2013 by splitting 
time in goal with freshman Nora Neset Gjoen. After Gjoen suffered a concussion during the ﬁ  rst half against the Seminoles, Burke has  become UF’s full-time starting goal-keeper.
“I think I’m just playing the same 
game that I always play,” Burke said. “I know Nora will be back, and 
we’ll be playing the same games that 
we have been, so we’re excited to get her back.”
Burleigh added: “When Nora 
went out with the injury against FSU, Taylor stepped up, and she’s done a terriﬁ  c job of keeping a clean sheet. When Nora gets back, that’s just even more competition.”
Burke’s responsibilities in goal 
are nothing new. She started all 25 matches last season and played the entirety of 19 to rack up 2,204 min-utes.
Burke ﬁ  nished the season with a 0.86 goals-against average, saving 60 shots and allowing 21 goals.
Her recent run of shutouts is also 
familiar territory. She helped Florida record four consecutive shutouts in 2012, beginning in the Southeastern Conference Tournament semiﬁ  nals and lasting until Florida’s loss to Notre Dame in the Sweet 16.
With two years of experience, 
Burke’s performance has become more consistent.“I’ve [improved] a lot with my 
footwork,” Burke said. “I kind of know how the games work now, how the weekends work, if we’re traveling or not. I think that just hav-ing experience, knowing what to expect in each game and how our system works has helped.”
The 6-foot-1 goalkeeper also 
credits her track experience — she is the UF indoor high-jump record holder — as being inﬂ  uential in her productivity.
“[Track and soccer] kind of in-
terpret into each other,” Burke said. “With high balls, it’s kind of the same motion as high jumping as it is playing goalkeeper. They’re weirdly 
alike.”
Burke has not faced many shots 
this season behind UF’s active back-
line — a beneﬁ  t she has enjoyed.
“I have to give a lot of credit to 
my defense; they’ve been playing unbelievable,” Burke said. “We’ve had a lot of new faces back there, and it’s been fun having new people 
in the back. We’ve all been doing re-
ally well together.”
Burleigh added: “Communica-
tion is huge. We expect a lot from our goalkeepers. For Taylor to be able to take care of things before they happen, it requires some com-munication and she’s done a terriﬁ  c job of that.”
