Pedro Bravo walks into a case management hearing Tuesday at the Alachua County 
Courthouse. Bravo, 19, is accused of kidnapping and murdering Christian Aguilar.

Pedro Bravo emerged from a side door in 
courtroom 3C Tuesday, his hair shorter than 
in his mugshot from last year. He wore a red jumpsuit and glanced quickly around the packed courtroom.
About 50 feet away, the Aguilar family 
members sat in the audience as they watched the accused killer of their 18-year-old son, Christian Aguilar, take the lectern as part of a case management hearing at the Alachua County Courthouse.
Bravo, 19, stands accused of his connection 
to the murder of Christian Aguilar, a UF fresh-man who went missing in September. In Oc-tober, two hunters found Christian Aguilar’s half-buried body in a Levy County hunting area about 40 miles southwest of Gainesville.
As of Tuesday, Bravo is charged with pre-
meditated murder, mishandling dead human body remains, ﬁ  ling a false report to police, lying to police, kidnapping, destroying evi-dence and poisoning food, water or medi-cine with the intent to kill, according to jail records.
Although the case management hearing 
led the case to be rescheduled for another hearing in April, Carlos Aguilar said making the journey from Doral to attend Bravo’s court hearings is a way to show the court he and his family are still interested in the case.
“For me, it’s important to be at every sin-
gle one,” he said. “That shows him that we are going to be here, and we’re still looking for justice.”
Carlos Aguilar said his family has not spo-
ken to Bravo or his family since Bravo’s arrest Sept. 24. Seeing him at Tuesday’s hearing re-minded Carlos Aguilar about his son’s death.
“[Bravo] saw us,” Aguilar said. “It was im-
portant to me to see his face and also that he sees me and I’m there and that my family’s Aguilars watch Bravo appear in court

Recent school shootings cast a 
spotlight on universities’ security , 
and UF is no exception.
The University Police Depart-
ment employs about 90 ofﬁ  cers, said operations commander Capt. Bart Knowles, and that’s enough to handle day-to-day operations. But, like 46 percent of campus protection stakeholders who responded to a 2012 survey conducted by Campus Safety Magazine, UF does not nec-essarily have enough staff members to handle a major incident.
Knowles said that in the event of 
an emergency , like a shooting, UPD would call on the Gainesville Police Department and the Alachua Coun-ty Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce.
“It takes a multiagency response 
to handle that situation,” he said.
But no shootings have occurred 
on UF’s campus in the last year, UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber wrote in an email.
In 2012, UPD had ﬁ  ve weapons 
complaints involving a ﬁ  rearm: three counts of carrying a concealed weapon without a permit in a ve-hicle, one of exhibition/display of a ﬁ  rearm and one of possession of a ﬁ  rearm on which the manufactur-er’s serial number was unlawfully altered or removed.
More than a quarter of survey 
respondents said their department was unprepared to respond to an active shooter or bomber.
UPD and other local law enforce-
ment agencies began more in-depth training after the 1999 Columbine High School shooting that left 13 dead, Knowles said. UPD ofﬁ  cers are trained to deal with an active UF ready

After closing Jan. 9 due to con-
struction issues, Burrito Brothers 
Taco Co. on West University Av-enue will reopen today at 11 a.m.
Randy Akerson, co-owner 
of Burrito Bros., said most of the structural problems were part of the Presbyterian and Disciples of Christ Student Center next to the restaurant.
“If the roof collapsed, it might 
affect the wall that divides us,” he said. “They’ve taken a temporary measure to render that side of the building.”Akerson said he was relieved 
that the restaurant is reopening after closing for two weeks.  
“We’ve leveled our bank ac-
counts,” he said. “To have our cash ﬂ  ow vanish for two weeks is catastrophic for any restaurant.”
Akerson said he paid the staff 
out-of-pocket to ensure they would not leave to ﬁ  nd other work, which cost him about “ﬁ  ve ﬁ  gures.”“It was imperative for the kids 
to be taken care of while we were closed,” he said. “These are good kids, and they work very hard.”
He added that the staff has 
been working since Monday to prepare for the reopening.
“It takes about 20 hours of la-
bor to open on any day ,” he said. “You can only imagine how long it

RACHEL KURLAND

Although some die-hard 
football fans watch the Super 
Bowl for the love of the game, others watch it purely for the commercials.
Doritos is hosting a competi-
tion, the Crash the Super Bowl College Challenge, to see which SEC school votes the most for its favorite Doritos commercial.
Whichever school casts the 
most votes will win a $25,000 concert on its campus, accord-ing a news release about the contest.
Students can vote and watch 
the contestants’ videos through the contest’s Facebook page. They can vote once a day on a computer and once a day on a phone or tablet until midnight Jan. 29, according to the contest rules.
This is the first year Doritos is offering a competition to SEC colleges, a Doritos representa-tive said.
“College kids are fans of Dor -
itos, and they love concerts,” she said, “so it’s just mixing the two and creating a friendly competi-tion.”
Jeff Klein, Frito-Lay senior 
marketing director, said col-lege students are a great demo-graphic to target for this contest because the voting process is done through Facebook, which is the best place to get their at-tention.
Because each school has dif-
ferent musical tastes, he said the $25,000 prize can be used to improve a previously scheduled concert or to create a brand new concert.
“What better way to reward 
the university who votes the most than with a concert on their own quad?” Klein said.
The amateur filmmakers cre-
ated the 30-second commercials. The winning videographer will receive $1 million and an oppor -
tunity to work with Michael Bay on his new film, “Transformers 4.”
The video winner will be an-
nounced live at the Super Bowl, Klein said, and the winning col-lege will be announced Jan. 30.
Erica Aguiar, a 20-year-old 
UF journalism sophomore, said has voted about five times al-ready and would love to win a concert for her school.
“It’s so great to be able to hear 
a famous performer, essentially, in our backyard,” she said.

Gov . Rick Scott announced last 
week that Florida’s unemployment 
rate dropped to 8 percent during De-cember, the lowest rate since Novem-ber 2008.
“The changes we are making to 
improve our state’s business climate are helping Florida families pursue the American dream,” Scott said.
The state’s unemployment rate 
fell 3.1 percent since Scott took office, according to a news release from the Governor’s Office.
Sarah Hamersma, assistant profes-
sor for UF’s Department of Econom-ics, said the decrease in the state’s unemployment rate follows a nation-wide trend.“Almost every state has had im-
provements in the last year,” she said.
Florida had the second largest 
drop in unemployment in the last year, behind Nevada, she said.
For 29 consecutive months, Flor -
ida has experienced positive annual job growth, according to the release.
With Florida home sales remain-
ing strong and economic growth trends up across the state, consumer confidence in Florida is near a five-year high, according to UF’s Con-sumer Confidence Index.
By 2018, Florida is expected to 
create more than 900,000 new jobs, according to the Florida Economic Estimating Conference.
“I see it as a step to the country be-
ing on a better track,” said Giovanni Santoro, an 18-year-old UF mechani-cal engineering freshman. “I hope 
that it impacts the rest of the nation.”Lowest unemployment

directorshooter, evacuate victims and preserve the crime scene. UF’s building emergency 
coordinators can receive additional training.
UF also has a critical incident response team that can deal with shooters who may 
have more superior fire power than regular street officers, Knowles said. However, he said, these situations often end in the first responder stopping the threat or the shooter committing suicide.
If UF were to have an emergency , like the shooting that happened Tuesday at 
Lone Star College’s North Harris campus in Houston, Texas, alerts would go out im-mediately. At UF, University Relations would coordinate with UPD to get the mes-sage out, said UF emergency management coordinator Kenneth Allen.
About 75 percent of survey respondents said they felt their institutions’ admin-
istrators took safety and security seriously. UF’s leaders do, Allen said, and they’ve demonstrated it by investing in safety efforts like the UF Alert system.
“There’s no question that safety and security is top priority for UF’s administra-
tion,” he said.

Gainesville cyclists are divided in 
their feelings about Lance Armstrong 
after he admitted to using performance enhancers.
The Oprah Winfrey Network aired a 
two-part interview with Armstrong on Thursday and Friday.
Martin Cox, a professional cyclist 
who works at Super Cool Bike Shop on West University Avenue and 34th Street, said Armstrong is a huge talking point among customers.
“He’s the biggest name in the sport,” 
the 23-year-old Santa Fe College sports management student said. “Like him or hate him, people are always going to talk about him.” 
Kara Hartford, a 21-year-old UF po-
litical science and geography senior and bike mechanic at the free bike repair ser -vice station in the  Reitz Union, grew up riding bikes. She was happy to see the cyclist fess up to taking drugs, because he’s been lying for so long. However, 
Hartford still respects and admires the pro 
cyclist. She said she thinks it’s a pro cy-clist’s job to win.
“They’re going to 
do what they need to do to keep their jobs,” she said. 
Ted Spiker, a UF 
journalism professor, said the angst peo-ple feel toward Armstrong comes from linking the athlete with his cancer con-tributions and with being seen as a liar in the sport.
“Everyone is making their own deci-
sion,” Spiker said. “I like the guy. I have posters of the guy , but I can’t hang those in my office anymore.”Gainesville cyclists react

Female inmates at the Alachua County Jail 
will take care of stray dogs as part of a reha-
bilitation program beginning in February.
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office an-
nounced Tuesday that Paws on Parole will start its program with female inmates for the first time beginning Feb. 5, said ASO spokes-man Lt. Todd Kelly.
The program is a partnership between 
the Florida Department of Corrections’ Gainesville Correctional Institution Work Camp and Alachua County Animal Services that involves inmates taking care and train-ing homeless dogs.
“The goal of the program is to increase 
the adoption rate of dogs in the shelter,” said Hilary Hynes, public education program co-ordinator for Alachua County Animal Ser -
vices.
Inmates in the program will train dogs 
throughout an eight-week period. At the end, they will receive a Canine Good Citizen cer-tificate from the American Kennel Club, she said. The program will start with two dogs and eventually expand to six.
She added that inmates will learn basic dog grooming and training techniques from volunteer professional trainers.
ASO Lt. Lee Hudson said inmates will 
receive a certificate for dog grooming and obedience training when they finish the pro-gram.
Upon release, they can use those market-
able skills to find employment, he said.
ASO Sheriff Sadie Darnell said the pro-
gram works well in prisons where inmates stay for a longer periods of time.
Now, the program will include low-risk 
inmates with minor crimes, she said.
“We’re trying to see if it will work within 
the constraints of the jail,” she said.
Hudson said he was worried that some 
of the inmates would be released before they complete the program.
“We want the inmates to be able to finish 
what they started,” he said. “Most impor-tantly, we will have successful graduates and a lot of good will come out of this.”Female inmates care for dogs
They started the Christian Aguilar Search and Rescue Foundation
there.”
Carlos Aguilar said the family is 
seeking a death penalty or life sen-
tence for Bravo.
“It’s very difficult because we 
know what he did, and he’s alive, and he’s there,” he said. “And I’m going to have to wait at least one or two years to see justice.”
Since the recovery of Christian 
Aguilar’s body, Carlos Aguilar said he doesn’t want people to remember his son only from the tragedy.
In November, he and his family 
started the Christian Aguilar Search and Rescue Foundation, an organi-zation dedicated to using trained tracking dogs to find missing vic-tims.
Aguilar said Strike Force K9, a 
Miami-based dog training company, donated two dogs to his founda-tion.
Jai, a 9-month-old Belgian Ma-
linois, and Atos, a 2-year-old Dutch Shepherd, are being trained to work with the foundation, said Scott Vega, director of operations and president of Strike Force K9.
“I’m a firm believer there is no 
nose better than a dog’s nose,” he said. “Whatever you don’t see and whatever you don’t smell, the dog will see it and smell it long before you do.”
A third dog, a 7-month-old Bel-
gian Malinois named Yafi, will join the ranks once training is complete.
Vega said the foundation is 
working to get certified by FEMA to send trained search and rescue pro-fessionals to assist investigators in missing persons investigations.
“We have to work hand in hand 
with law enforcement agencies,” he said. “We don’t want to step on their toes.”
Vega said the foundation will 
begin operating in Florida “in the near future.” He said the goal is to expand nationwide.
“There are a lot of people missing 
in the country, and there are a lot of families that are hurting right now,” he said. “The bigger picture is want-ing to help humanity.”
Until the April hearing, Carlos 
Aguilar, his family, friends and sup-porters will have to wait for more answers and, eventually, justice.
“Every day you wake up, and 
you think about my son,” Carlos Aguilar said. “And every night, we go to sleep, and we think about Christian. So the pain is still there. I think it’s not going to go away. It’s in our heart, and we’re going to con-tinue praying.”

Matthew Cole, a 20-year-old UF nuclear en-
gineering junior, said he visited the restaurant 
last Wednesday to get a bite to eat, only to find the restaurant closed.
“I went there, and the sign was on the fence,” 
he said. “I was upset because I had to go some-where mediocre.”
Cole said he visited the restaurant about one 
to two times a week last semester and added that he was relieved that it was open again.
“There’s definitely a good chance I will be 
there for the reopening,” he said.Mark Rush, a UF economics professor, said 
he was “deeply concerned” that the restaurant would not open again.
“Simply thinking about that possibility 
made me realize how sad I would be if it never reopened,” he wrote in an email. “Even on days when I do not go to BB, simply knowing that it is open is reassuring.”
Rush mentioned that he’s had a history with 
the restaurant since he started teaching at UF.
“For what it’s worth, I can tell you that the 
owner of BB introduced me to President Ma-chen inside of BB’s old location,” he wrote. “Apparently President Machen, too, is a big fan.”
Akerson said he hopes for a big crowd to-
day.
“We didn’t die,” he said. “It was not our de-
cision to close, and we didn’t go out of business. We promise.”Burrito , from page 1

Student Sen. Morgan Vollrath expresses his discontent Tuesday at the 
Reitz Union after the Senate voted to table his election codes reform bill until next week.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Writer
The Student Senate voted 
Tuesday to table a bill regarding 
election code reform for next week’s meeting.
However, after the meet-
ing, Senate President Christina Bonarrigo said she will create a  temporary committee to look at the issues raised in the bill.  
She suggested creating the 
committee during the meeting, which would be lead by Sen. Cory Yeffet and Sen. Morgan Vollrath.
But Vollrath refused.  “They never came forward 
with my specific problems,” Vollrath said after the meeting.
The bill, which Vollrath au-
thored, proposed to remove re-strictions about campaigning in the election codes. 
The way the codes read now restrict campaigning to a week and have vague language, Voll-rath said.
After the meeting, he said the 
changes focused on the wording to become more strict regarding individual actions related to a candidate or party during cam-paigning.
Sen. Matt Pesek, one of the 
bill’s sponsors, said the bill stands for freedom of speech.
“This bill will clear up those 
problems and be a victory for free speech on campus,” he said.
The changes would not be in 
effect for the upcoming Spring elections, but rather the Fall 2013 elections.
Bonarrigo said she was in fa-
vor of the bill and wanted the codes reform at once, not split up between sessions.
“Let’s get them one and 
done,” Bonarrigo said.After the meeting, she said 
she will reach out to the Sen-ate for another co-chairperson, as she wants the committee to include both the Students Party and Swamp Party members. Vollrath is a Students Party senator, and Yeffet is a Swamp Party senator.
During the meeting, the Sen-
ate unanimously passed bills that require the Senate to be notified 48 hours before any ap-pointments for executive cabi-net officer, supervisor of elec-tions, assistant supervisor of elections and any election com-mission.
The body also unanimously 
passed a referendum to be on the Spring elections ballot Feb. 19 and Feb. 20. 
The non-binding referendum 
will gauge student opinion on Gainesville bars to close at 3 a.m. but stop serving alcohol at 2 a.m.

BILLY KENNEDY

Gov. Rick Scott, who in 2011 signed a con-
troversial bill cutting the number of early-vot-
ing days from 14 to eight, reversed course and called for early voting to last up to 14 days.
The proposal comes about two months af-
ter the 2012 general election, which saw Flor -
ida voters waiting hours to vote, lower voter turnout and delayed elections results.
In a statement Thursday , Scott said he 
wants “to ensure we do whatever possible to improve our election system from the state-wide level.”
Scott’s proposal also called for more early-
voting locations and reducing ballot lengths, including shorter descriptions of constitution-al amendments.Daniel Smith, a UF political science profes-
sor, said he’s skeptical about Scott’s proposal.
“It remains to be seen if Gov. Scott’s en-
dorsement of extending the number of early-voting days to two weeks is truly a change of heart or merely political pandering,” he said. “The governor … shed many a crocodile tear when thousands of Floridians were forced to wait in line for hours on end during the trun-cated eight-day voting period.”
The bill also eliminated early voting on the 
last Sunday before Election Day, prohibited voters from changing their addresses at the polls and required voters who live outside the county where they’re registered to cast provi-sional ballots.
Of the about 30,000 provisional ballots 
cast in Florida, one-fifth were found to be in-valid and didn’t count toward the final elec-tion results, according to a report Smith co-authored.
The report found that black and Hispanic 
voters were nearly twice as likely as white voters to have their provisional bal-lots rejected.
Jonel Edwards, a 
22-year-old UF political sci-ence senior and president 
of the Gator chapter of the NAACP , said she thinks Scott was trying to score 
political points when he called for more early voting days.
“While I welcome the return of 14 days for 
early voting, I in no way believe that Rick Scott has seen the light,” she said. “Even after the election in November, Scott stood by his cut of early-voting days that turned Election Day into a mess.”
In Alachua County, about 39,000 ballots 
were cast early in the 2012 election, a 22-per -
cent drop from the 50,000 early votes cast in 2008, said Supervisor of Elections Pam Car -
penter.
While long lines didn’t plague most Ala-
chua County precincts in 2012, Carpenter said, history showed that residents would have used extra early-voting days to cast ballots.
“Had we had more early-voting days, we 
would have had more people take advantage of early voting,” she said.
Having more early-voting days can relieve 
some of the stress placed on voting precincts during elections, and, Carpenter said, having more early-voting days is more important than having longer early-voting days.

UF may soon join dozens of colleges 
around the country in implementing 
gender-neutral housing options.
Gators Coalition for an Inclusive 
Campus is putting together a proposal for gender-inclusive or gender-neutral housing, which means a student could live in on-campus housing with any oth-er student, regardless of his or her gender. The coalition will present the proposal to the administration in two weeks.
If a student does not feel comfortable 
with gender-inclusive housing, then he or she can still opt for traditional housing, said Marla Munro, president of Gators Coalition for an Inclusive Campus.
“We want to give transgender stu-dents a place where they can feel safe and comfortable,” said the 21-year-old UF women’s studies junior.
Munro said other schools, like Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley, have had positive feedback about their gender-neutral housing.
Shaneece Dixon, a 23-year-old jour -
nalism senior, said she doesn’t have a problem with gender-neutral housing.
“I think it should have been an option 
from the get-go,” she said.
But Josh Longerbeam, a 21-year-old 
third-year UF computer engineering stu-dent said he thinks the school’s budget should go toward pressing issues like making sure all majors have significant funding for research and classes.
“I just don’t think it’s necessary,” Lon-
gerbeam said.Gender-neutral dorms

Gainesville Police have arrested a man in 
connection to his adoptive mother’s murder.
Police charged Darryl Dewayne Scott, 40, 
with murder and grand theft auto, according 
to a GPD news release.
The investigation started after a group of 
friends found Roxie E. Scott-Kotb, 63, of 3301 SW 13th St. Apt. U282, dead in her Bivens Cove apartment Jan. 13, GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said.
Police determined that Scott-Kotb was dead 
in her apartment for more than a week, and her 2007 Mercury Milan and purse were missing, Tobias said.
Family members told police that Scott lived 
with Scott-Kotb until she kicked him out three months ago when she noticed he misused her credit cards, Tobias said.
On Jan. 14, police stopped Scott-Kotb’s car 
just after midnight, according to the release. The group in the car told police that Scott let them use the car in exchange for crack cocaine.
Later that day , investigators found that 
Scott stole a car from his workplace, Gator City Motor, on the 1700 block of North Main Street, according to the release.
Police continued the investigation and 
learned that Scott used Scott-Kotb’s credit cards and traveled to New York. Detectives is-
sued an arrest warrant for Scott Jan. 15, Tobias said.
On Sunday , an Orange 
County Sheriff’s Office deputy arrested Scott at a gas station in Orange County, Tobias said.
The deputy saw the 
car’s temporary license plate was altered with 
marker, and after running the correct plate number through a police computer, he learned the car had been reported stolen.
Deputies booked Scott into the Orange 
County Jail at about 6 p.m. Sunday. As of Tues-day, he remained in custody without bond.
Tobias said Scott would be transferred to 
the Alachua County Jail sometime this week.

68% NOTuesday’s question: Did you watch President Barack Obama’s inauguration? Bey-tter Than You: 
Calm down about 
lip-synching, dummies
There are four words we should never have to say: Back off 
Beyoncé, everyone.
Apparently , news got out that she lip-synched to a 
track of the national anthem during President Barack Obama’s inauguration.
According to the New York Times, the singer decided at the 
last minute to record a version of the song.
“We don’t know why ,” said Master Sgt. Kristin duBois, the 
spokeswoman for the Marine Band. “But that is what we were instructed to do, so that is what we did. It’s not because Beyoncé can’t sing. We all know Beyoncé can sing. We all know the Ma-rine Band can play.”
It’s not uncommon for performers to prerecord their tracks or 
to use backing tracks for events like the inauguration ceremony in case something happens or the weather is bad. The entire cer-emony was performed live with the exception of the national anthem.
Look up the broadcast of her performance, and then com-
pare it with a video recording from the perspective of a specta-tor from the crowd at the inauguration. Some of the Jumbotrons projecting the speeches and performances may have malfunc-tioned, which distorted most of the sound. 
Remember halfway through her performance, when Beyon-
cé took out her earpiece to the surprise and delight of viewers? Guess the earpiece was super unnecessary. 
Now, here’s the thing: Back off Beyoncé, everyone. Accord-
ing to The Washington Post, even Whitney Houston’s perfor-mance at the 1991 Super Bowl was lip-synched.
Ricky Minor, the band leader on the “Tonight Show” and 
Houston’s musical director at the time, said, “In a crowd that large and loud, it was impossible for Houston to hear herself,” according to an ABC News article.
“Though she did sing, it was her pre-recorded voice that the 
audience heard,” according to the article.
Are we better than Whitney Houston and Beyoncé? Abso-
lutely not. Let’s not judge fabulous ladies because they played it better-safe-than-sorry . 
Vulture published an article this week titled: “Who Betrayed 
America More: Lance Armstrong or Beyoncé?”
To be fair, it’s a generally ﬂ  ippant article that doesn’t take 
itself very seriously — something these opinions pages also at-tempt to get across at times. But the reaction to and disappoint-ment in Beyoncé’s “misstep” is so silly . Why are so many people upset with her performance choice? It’s not an issue. It means people will always want to complain about whatever they feel like picking apart that day . How about we leave Queen Bey alone for two seconds and snap back to reality, folks.
Band director Colonel Michael J. Colburn said Beyoncé 
“wasn’t comfortable performing without a rehearsal, and I wasn’t comfortable with that either,” according to The Wash-ingtonian. “We always knew that was a possibility.”
Chill out, everyone. This will not affect any of your lives in 
any adverse manner whatsoever. If you’re a little miffed about it, we politely ask that you get over it.From gun control to thumb patrol
Last Friday, in its edition of Darts and Laurels, the Alli-
gator mentioned, “There were a lot of lessons to learn this week.” Of course, last week passed, but I can’t 
help but share what valuable lessons I also learned.
For starters, I learned that if you’re incapable of arguing 
with a group of people that expresses an opinion different from your own, you can publish a patronizing piece, belit-tling said group of people by pointing out their illiteracy, ironically. I also learned that grammar, spelling and syntax are totally fair game in a spirited debate about gun control. From now on, I will be wary of words that are popularly misspelled.
Is gun control hyphenated or not?  Additionally, I realized that the point of the column was 
just a gross oversimpliﬁ  cation of the way we read it — the ﬁ  rst time.
Also, I ask that you leave your derisive dictionary at 
the door, along with your condescending crowbar. Until then, I will try my best to avoid physical altercations with grown men who maliciously enter into my apartment un-announced. A .38-caliber handgun should temporarily sub-due my aggressor — or so I learned.    
Which leads me to my next point: If your violent 6-year-
old child makes a gun gesture during a harmless game of pretend, don’t be surprised when you receive a call from the Politically Correct Police, telling you your child was suspended from school.
That’s right. According to an article on Fox News’ web-
site, “Two 6-year-old boys from Maryland were suspended from school for making gun gestures during a harmless game of pretend.”
According to the article, the incident wasn’t the ﬁ  rst of 
its kind. Last month, Rodney Lynch was suspended from his school for making the same gesture.
In all honesty, I believe the teachers were right to sus-
pend the children. Why? Because even though a 6-year-old child doesn’t possess the psychological capacity to under-stand why making such a gesture would perturb adults, the act itself is mean. Therefore, it’s wrong.
Furthermore, I would like to 
support the need for stricter, more sensible thumb control legisla-tion. Although there is no law that can prevent every senseless act of gesturing, we have a fundamental obligation to try.
Therefore, I have put together a list of practical thumb 
safety measures; actions to combat the thumb-obsessed cul-ture we live in; steps that will keep guns — I mean thumbs — out of the hands of the obedient — I mean the disobedi-ent.
First, it’s time we restore a ban on bully-style assault 
phalanges, even though a similar ban, circa 1994, was ef-fectively ineffective. Research by a former thumb control advocate in his 1998 opus, “More Thumbs, Less Crime,” found no impact on pretend crime from these bans. We will ignore these ﬁ  ndings. 
Second, we must also implement a high-capacity ex-
tremities ban. As it turns out, Lynch was carrying a Poin-termaster .223: a highly lethal limb that, when paired with a “pow!” can inﬂ  ict maximum psychological damage. Un-fortunately, his school in Montgomery County had some of the most stringent laws on thumb control in the classroom. Nothing could have prevented this tragedy. 
Now, this will be difﬁ  cult. There will be students who 
will say, “If thumbs hurt people, then logically, apples make teachers fat and tug-of-war causes kids to lose.”
They want to gin up fear. They want to eliminate thumb-
free zones.
And they want to increase the amount of children who 
are capable of concealed gesturing. This may spur a move-ment to oppose opposable thumbs!

Lately, we’ve heard a lot 
about the right to keep and bear arms.
You probably also have 
heard about the right to free speech or the right to a fair trial.
Some use the word “right” 
as an argument for things like health care, education or a liv-ing wage.
But how do we determine whether something is a 
right?
We can derive a theory of rights using three very 
important principles: the self-ownership principle, the homesteading principle and the nonaggression prin-ciple.
First, the principle of self-ownership, contends that 
man is a rational being who has no instinctual or innate knowledge about how to survive, and therefore must actively rely on his mind and reason to live. 
Through reason, man exerts full control of his ac-
tions and thus has full ownership of his body.
This principle is axiomatic. To argue that one does not have ownership of his 
body is an immediate contradiction, because one must use and control his body (his mouth, his mind, his tongue) to argue otherwise. 
In denying self-ownership you afﬁ  rm it.Second, the homesteading principle states that be-
cause man has ownership of his body, if he uses his labor to produce something from land that was previ-ously unowned (i.e., no one has a claim or title to that land), then, as John Locke argued, he mixes his labor with the land and thus extends ownership to the it and what he produces from it.   
He can use this land and its fruits as he sees ﬁ  t and 
can dispose of everything he produces, because no one else has a just claim.
But to arrive at a principle of rights, one must recog-
nize that man is also a social being. 
While it is possible for man to survive using only the 
resources on his land, it would be extremely difﬁ  cult and likely an impoverished and short life. 
For man to thrive, he must interact with others.A right, therefore, is an ethical concept that relates to 
how men engage and interact with each other. 
By establishing rights, we can easily distinguish 
what each member of society owns and facilitate the means for voluntary trade and commerce. 
Without clear property rights, everyone can lay 
claim to everything, which leads to turmoil, strife and war.
Let us imagine a society with two people: A and B. Let us say A asserts that he owns B’s property. For an ethical principle that relates to man’s nature 
to be valid, it must be true for all individuals. 
In this scenario, A’s assertion that he owns the prop-
erty of B is not universal, because A claims the exis-tence of property rights for himself while denying B the same rights, ultimately making B a slave to A. 
As Murray Rothbard argues, this leaves B in a cate-
gory of sub-humanity and makes the principle invalid. 
Thus, we ﬁ  nally arrive at the principle of nonaggres-
sion: that no man may initiate force against the prop-erty or person of another. 
Aggression against another individual violates his 
or her nature as a free, productive being who must pur-sue certain ends to live. 
Any aggression against a man’s property constitutes 
an aggression against his person. 
Therefore, any initiation of aggression against man’s 
life, liberty or property is ethically unjust.
From these principles, we can understand how we 
derive man’s right to his life, his liberty and his prop-erty. 
In next week’s column, I will apply these ideas to 
show how one determines whether something consti-tutes a right or is simply a misuse of the term.

Communication. His column appears on Wednesdays.Do I really have

Student loans are near and dear to all our hearts. 
You like them a lot more than I do at this point — I promise.  
Making payments is not nearly as fun as receiving 
refunds. Refunds end up as new laptops or tablets, nights 
out with friends and a Spring Break trip we never forget. Repayment means box wine at home instead of bar tabs, Netﬂ  ix instead of cable and stay-cation instead of vacation.
The student loan debt tally is soaring higher and 
seemingly has no end in sight. 
Colleges and universities have little incentive to 
truly control prices because there are so many people 
willing to ﬁ  nance enormous amounts of money to get a degree.
We have been socialized to believe and think that 
everyone should get a college degree. Student loans exist to make that a reality.
We thought the same about owning a home, and 
sub-prime lending made that a possibility. The end result was, and still is, a huge disaster. Borrowers could borrow far more money than their home was worth with little correlation to their ability to repay. Financing a college education is no different.
Federal student loans are not based on your ability to 
repay. You can borrow the same amount of money for a degree that could land you a job making $35,000 as you could for one that could allow you to earn $75,000.
We should put the blame on the university for 
charging the same price for those two degrees because they don’t have the same economic value. 
We all decide what we want to study, and I’m not 
suggesting that one is better or more important than the other; I mention it only because we need to make smart ﬁ  nancial decisions about our future.
According to the university, the cost to attend the 
University of Toledo with no grants or scholarships and live on campus is $23,108 a year. That is $93,432 for a four-year degree. 
That is an enormous monthly payment to make after 
graduation, even you work. And that debt isn’t like other debts you have or will incur later — you own it forever.
It is almost impossible to discharge a student loan 
in bankruptcy, and the lenders don’t play by the same rules as other creditors. 
They can garnish your wages, take your tax refunds, take a portion of your social security or the social security of your cosigner and the list goes on.
The good news is federal 
student loans have far more options for help than their private 
counterparts. So please avoid private loans if at all possible. 
One of the biggest advantages is loan forgiveness 
(not for private loans) if you work in public service. 
This option allows for graduates to take jobs in the 
public sector that typically don’t pay as well as private sector jobs and have the balance of their loans forgiven after meeting certain requirements. 
You can read all the details at www.ﬁ  naid.org/
loans/publicservice.phtml.
As a bankruptcy attorney, the number of people I see 
with unmanageable student loan debt is staggering and frightening. 
In almost every case, they borrowed far more money 
than they could possibly repay given the ﬁ  eld they chose. I’m not talking just about artists, ﬁ  lm or liberal arts majors. 
I am talking about teachers, attorneys, accountants 
and even doctors and engineers. Even if they are lucky enough to get a job with a high salary, the student loan payment is equally high. Filing bankruptcy isn’t as easy as it used to be, so now they may not qualify even if student loans were dischargeable.
Do yourself and your family a huge favor, and 
borrow responsibly. Don’t borrow more than you have to. Work part time, and use that money for rent and Spring Break — not student loan money. 
You have options. Do some research before you sign 
any loan documents. 
Talk to someone in the ﬁ  nancial aid ofﬁ  ce. Talk with 
your parents or someone you trust who understands ﬁ  nance and money to help you understand what you are getting yourself into. 
Your education is the door to a bright, and successful 
future and being as responsible as possible now will make sure that paying for that education doesn’t devastate your future.  
Good luck!Troy M. Hawkins is a Toledo bankruptcy lawyer who

It was 4:44 p.m. Friday 
when Ryan Jones realized he 
had a missed call and voice-mail on his phone from his former professor, friend and ESPN freelancer Steve John-son.
Without hesitation, Jones, a 
23-year-old UF journalism se-nior, called Johnson, who laid down the plan to Jones, ask-ing him to photograph Notre Dame football player Manti Te’o during ESPN’s exclusive interview in Bradenton — the first interview since Deadspin published its story about his “girlfriend hoax.”
Within 15 minutes, Jones 
was on the road with a two-and-a-half hour drive to Bra-denton, armed with a Nikon D600 and two lenses.
Jones entered the meeting 
at 8 p.m. with ESPN reporter Jeremy Schaap and shook hands with Te’o and his con-sultant at the IMG academy , a private training institute. A few minutes into the inter -
view and only three pictures taken, Jones heard Te’o ner -
vously ask if he was going to be shooting the whole time. It was his cue to leave.
After almost two hours, 
Jones was invited to come back into the interview. He took 133 pictures.
After the interview, ESPN 
producer Shawn Fitzgerald ordered three boxes of pizza. He gave a box of pepperoni pizza to Jones, who shared a slice with Te’o. The two en-joyed their pizza in a confer -
ence room while watching the ESPN broadcast on a TV , which was being taped across the street.
After the pizza, Jones 
headed back to Gainesville. He arrived at 4:30 a.m. after a nap in a Walgreens parking lot.
Jones, who was a student 
in Johnson’s visual journal-ism class in the Fall, worked with Johnson at the Beef ‘O’ Brady’s Bowl in December. 
J o h n s o n , who was in Boston Fri-day night on vaca-tion, said he chose Jones because he was inde-
pendent .
“[Jones] was in my class 
last semester, and he kicked butt,” Johnson said.
Since Friday night, Jones’ 
pictures have appeared on about 20 websites, including Sports Illustrated, The New York Times and The Huffing-ton Post.
Jones wrote about his ex-
perience on his blog, Ryan Jones Photography , at about midnight Monday . With a little help from a friend, Jones’ Twitter followers jumped from 30 to 100, and his blog’s views began to skyrocket to the thousands.
“I’ve gotten a lot of love 
from fellow photographers and journalists,” Jones said.

Sixty-six times a day . That’s the 
amount of rape cases reported to the 
Indian government in 2011. And it’s suspected that thousands go unre-ported annually due to social stigma.
The Dec. 16 gang rape of a 23-year-
old woman in New Delhi brought media attention and outrage about women’s daily struggles in India. The outcry has hit home at UF, where many reacted to the event.
Daniela Sanchez said people push 
the story away because they feel pow-erless, but if people made the situa-tion known, then authorities would take notice.
“It makes me angry … the idea 
that I am a human being and the only thing that sets me apart from people living and going through this is that I was born in a different place,” said the 19-year-old sociology sophomore.
Sanchez wants to encourage stu-
dents to become more involved with humanitarian causes on campus, such as UNICEF and International Justice Mission.
Leela Kumaran, a project coordi-
nator for UF’s College of Education who grew up in India, said there needs to be a cultural understanding.
She said her initial reaction was 
horror, but she wasn’t surprised.
“Women are supposed to be invis-
ible there … this is something that is common,” Kumaran said.
She said it will take a few gen-erations to see significant change for women in India, though she hopes the conversation does not die down.
“It’s misogynistic in many ways, 
but the problem doesn’t stop at just India,” said 20-year-old UF psychol-ogy junior Jasmine Esmailbegui. “America, as well as many other countries, remain dominated by no-tions of masculinity and unequal treatment of women.”
Kelsey Harclerode expressed her 
hope that media coverage reignites a global conversation.
“The outrage in the U.S. cannot 
stop at nations beyond our borders,” said the 21-year-old UF political sci-ence and women’s studies junior. “We can simply question why we live in a society that cares more about the length of a woman’s skirt than justice for a rape victim.”

After inconsistency, missed 
practices and a lack of account-
ability put a damper on his junior year, Mike Rosario knew he had to change in the offseason. 
Coach Billy Donovan knew it, 
too. Although he didn’t call it an ultimatum, Donovan sent Rosa-rio a clear message: The ball is in your court. 
“It was pretty clear. You need 
to practice every day, you need to play the right way, and you need to take care of your responsibili-ties off the court,” Donovan said,  imitating his discussions with Rosario. “If you can’t do those three things, I’m not going to play you.” Rosario has played by Dono-
van’s rules successfully this sea-son.
The redshirt senior guard 
ranks second on the team with 12.5 points per game this year af-ter averaging 6.6 points last sea-son. His 46.1 percent shooting clip is a career best. 
Rosario didn’t earn a start in 
2011-12 but has started 15 games this season. His playing time has more than doubled from 14.4 min-utes per game to 29.3 minutes per contest. 
The New Jersey native has 
also stayed relatively healthy this year. After missing six games and 25 practices last season with back, leg and hip injuries, Rosario has missed only one contest, due to a left ankle sprain. 
“I knew that something was 
going to have to change in order for me to play the way my team-mates need me to perform,” Rosa-rio said. “I felt like, by me taking on that challenge, that [Donovan] basically put my back against the wall. I feel like I’ve been do-ing a great job responding to it.”

Sydney Moss and assistant 
coaches David Lowery and 
Murriel Page are alone.
The freshman and her two 
coaches are running drills in an empty O’Connell Center on Tuesday afternoon. 
Moss brushes off Page, who 
simulates a screen being set, takes a pass from Lowery and shoots a mid-range jump shot. 
She repeats this move again 
and again, each time with Low-ery urging her to remain bal-anced, square her shoulders and follow through with the shot. 
One attempt bounces off the 
rim and out, much to Moss’ dis-may, but she continues her rep-etitions.
She focuses on her release 
point, her footwork and the in-structions being shouted to her from the pair of coaches. 
“I’m struggling right now 
offensively,” Moss said.
“The ball just rims in and 
out. My layups go in and out. That’s why we have individual [workouts].”
Southeastern Conference 
play has been unkind to Moss, who is one of four freshmen who regularly contributes for the Gators. 
In 14 non-conference games, she averaged 11.6 points on 42.1 percent shooting. Those numbers have declined to 6.4 points on 22.9 percent shooting in UF’s five SEC games. 
The struggles began in Flori-
da’s conference opener, a 76-69 loss to Kentucky on Jan. 3. 
Moss, who was named 
the 2012 Gatorade Kentucky Girls Basketball Player of the Year while at Boone County 
(Ky.) High, was making a h o m e c o m i n g 
of sorts.
Boone is 
about 70 miles north of Me-morial Colise-um, and Moss 
had many of her family and friends in attendance. 
However, she toiled through 
an unsatisfying performance. 
The freshman shot 0 of 10 
from the floor and was held scoreless for the first time as a Gator. She turned the ball over three times, never gaining any rhythm during her 20 minutes on the floor.  
“It was frustrating,” Moss 
said. “Just one of those games.”
Poor shooting has continued 
to plague Moss.
She has yet to shoot better 
than 40 percent in a conference JOE MORGAN

Less than one week after defensive coordinator 
Dan Quinn left the Gators for the NFL, coach Will 
Muschamp has filled out his staff.
Florida hired defensive line coach Brad Lawing 
from Southeastern Conference rival South Carolina on Tuesday. Lawing will serve as assistant head coach and work alongside Bryant Young as co-defen-sive line coach.
“I’m excited to have the opportunity to work with 
coach Muschamp and the entire Gator coaching staff,’’ Lawing said in a statement. “Coach Muschamp and I share the same philosophical beliefs defensively.”
Lawing spent 17 years on the Gamecocks’ staff 
in two different stints, the second of which began in 2006. Other stops during his coaching career include Michigan State, North Carolina and Appalachian State.
Lawing has coached three All-America defensive 
linemen in his career: Julian Peterson of the Spartans and Melvin Ingram and Jadeveon Clowney of the Gamecocks. Peterson and Ingram were both first-round NFL draft selections.
ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. said during a Decem-
ber teleconference that if Clowney was eligible for this year’s draft, the sophomore would be the No. 1 overall pick.
Lawing also recruited four-time Pro Bowler John 
Abraham to play at South Carolina.
“His track record speaks for itself,” Muschamp 
said of Lawing in a statement. “His nearly three de-cades of experience coaching defensive linemen, his familiarity with the SEC and our shared philosophi-cal beliefs make him a perfect fit for our program.”
Muschamp added Lawing to his staff only six 
days after Quinn accepted an offer to become the Sea-hawks defensive coordinator. The position opened up when Gus Bradley took the Jaguars head-coach-ing job on Jan. 16.
Muschamp promoted special teams coordinator 
D.J. Durkin to defensive coordinator shortly after Quinn signed a three-year deal with Seattle report-edly worth $5.7 million. 
“Part of my job is anticipating when things are 
going to happen,” Muschamp said on Friday. “Ob-viously, with Dan’s relationship with the Seattle or -
ganization, I knew when Gus Bradley got a job there would be interest on their part and possibly some in-terest on his part.”
When Quinn received the call, Muschamp acted 
quickly and tabbed Durkin. Muschamp said

Erik Murphy, UF forward  
@e_murphy33promoting UF’s third-year special teams coordinator will 
help maintain stability in the Gators’ defensive scheme.
“(Durkin) understands everything, and our system’s 
pretty good,” Muschamp said.
“We’re going to continue to be really good. [Quinn] 
had never called defenses two years ago until he showed up at Florida, and he did a pretty good job in two years. And D.J. hasn’t either, and we’re going to be good. We’re going to be fine with that.”
While Durkin’s promotion was convenient, Mus-
champ picked the 35-year-old coach to replace Quinn for the same reasons he elected to retain Durkin from former UF coach Urban Meyer’s staff.
“[Durkin] is very bright, smart, energetic (and) does 
a great job with our players,” Muschamp said on Friday . “Obviously, you see the results he had on special teams. They’re outstanding. Great teacher. He sees the big pic-ture of the game and understands what it takes to be suc-cessful.”

Mike Rosario (3) attempts a shot during Florida’s 83-52 
win against Missouri on Saturday in the O’Connell Center.
Guard making strides on both sides of 
ball during final season at Florida
Rosario was Rutgers’ go-to option on 
offense. From 2008-10 with the Scarlet Knights, Rosario led his team in scor -
ing with 16.4 points per game but shot only 38.4 percent. He averaged almost 15 field goal attempts per game. 
“If you looked at his statistics at 
Rutgers, yes, he scored a lot of points, but he was really a high-volume shoot-er,” Donovan said. “When he plays the right way, he has really good vision (and) is a really good passer. When he makes simple, really good plays, it makes our team better. It makes him a much better, more effective player on the offensive floor.”
After sitting out 2010-11 because of 
NCAA transfer rules, Rosario lacked decision-making skills on offense dur -
ing his junior year. But the 6-foot-3 guard has finally cleaned up his hab-its. 
According to KenPom.com, Rosa-
rio’s offensive rating ranked outside of the nation’s top 500 during each of his first three seasons. This year, it is 117.2, which ranks 183rd in the coun-try.
Although Rosario still struggles 
with ball security, Donovan said the guard has made strides on defense.   
“Last year, he was really a weak 
defender and wasn’t really committed to or saw the value in it,” Donovan said.
“He continues to impress and con-
tinues to get better. But I’m not sure Mike has ever done this for an entire year in college. So we obviously have a long way to go, and I want him to embrace that.” 
Rosario’s mental approach in prac-
tice has also improved. 
“He just comes in every day and 
works,” senior forward Erik Murphy said. “He hasn’t had any lapses, espe-cially recently. ... He’s in the weight room a little extra, trying to get his body right.”
With No. 8 Florida (14-2, 4-0 SEC) 
heading into Athens, Ga., to face Georgia tonight at 8, Rosario hopes to stay hot from the field. In his past four games, he has averaged 15 points on 51.2 percent shooting.
As he continues to experience suc-
cess, Rosario can finally put his junior season behind him. 
“Last year, I felt like in my play 
I didn’t really bring nothing to the team,” Rosario said. 
“This is my chance to really sit and 
listen to what [Donovan] has to say and give myself to [Donovan], be-cause something special can happen out of this.”

Forward key off bench
game this season. 
According to wbbstate.
com, Moss has posted an ef-
ficiency rating greater than 10 just once in SEC play after doing so in eight non-confer -
ence contests. 
Despite the inconsistency, 
Moss continues to be a criti-cal member of coach Aman-da Butler’s rotation.
She has started seven 
games but typically functions as the team’s first player off the bench. 
Butler, who played four 
years at Florida, understands the difficulties of performing as a freshman.
She has pressed Moss to 
continue working through adversity. 
“That’s a lesson all our 
freshmen have had to learn, and Sydney included,” But-ler said.
“The competition you are 
going to face is very good — the best you have ever seen. They’re going to take things away from you.
“We’ve got to be able to 
get over that, and you have to be able to get over that quickly because if you pull that negative energy into the next play, then your chances of success are diminishing immediately.”  
With senior Jennifer 
George nursing an injured right shoulder and the schedule unrelenting, Flori-da’s success, in part, hinges on Moss’ ability to rebound from her recent slump.
“It’s just motivation,” 
Moss said. “I can do a lot better.”

When Florent Diep enrolled at Florida 
in January 2012, the Frenchman had to ad-
just to life in the U.S. and life in college.
If that wasn’t enough, former coach 
Andy Jackson threw Diep right into the fire.
Diep made his dual-match debut in 
Florida’s 6-1 win against Baylor on Jan. 22, 2012. Diep clinched the match for UF when he defeated Marko Krickovic 7-5, 7-5 only 13 days after starting his first semester of college in a new country.
One year later, Diep is finally feeling 
comfortable in his role as a student-ath-lete.
“It was tough last year at the begin-
ning,” Diep said following Saturday’s 5-2 win against Miami.
“Everything was new, so now I got one 
year (of experience), so I know pretty much everything. … It’s easier, and I feel more focused on the court. I can be more focused on what I have to do and play.”
In his first semester, Diep notched a 14-9 
record in singles and a 2-2 record in dou-bles. He finished on a six-match win streak. Diep continued to improve as he began his junior campaign. 
During the fall semester, he put up a 
13-6 record in singles and teamed with junior Mike Alford to post a 10-3 doubles record.
Diep and Alford picked up where they 
left off on Saturday. Following Billy Feder -
hofer and Gordon Watson’s 8-1 win against the Hurricanes’ team of Omar Aly and Wil-liam Albanese, Diep and Alford clinched the doubles point for the Gators with an 8-2 victory against UM duo Wilfredo Gonzalez and Marco Stancati. 
“[Diep and I] have been working really 
hard in practice every day and just trying to get better,” Alford said after the match. “We just tried to execute on some of the things that we’d been working on in prac-tice, and [Saturday] I think we both played well.”
Diep also added a win in singles on Sat-
urday. The junior earned the last point for Florida when he defeated Miami’s Diego Soto 6-0, 7-6 (4).
“He’s a little bit of a perfectionist,” coach 
Bryan Shelton said on Saturday.
“He won the first set six-love [Satur -
day], and he came over during the change 
over and told me three or four things that he wasn’t doing well. … He’s worked really hard 
on the court every day. I mean, this guy wants to play professional tennis one day, and he wants to do everything he can pos-sibly do to help the Gators along the way.”
Diep will look to continue his success 
when No. 12 Florida (1-0) takes on UCF (1-1) tonight at 5 at Linder Stadium.
Though midweek matches are often 
overlooked, Alford said the Gators are ex-pecting the Knights to put up a fight.
“We’re going to be doing the same 
things in practice and just try to improve (with the quick turnaround),” Alford said on Saturday.
“UCF has a good team, and we’re not 
going to overlook them because it’s a Wednesday match. We know we’re going to have to be ready to go.”
