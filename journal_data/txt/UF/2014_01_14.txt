Gainesville Police is investigating both 
a suspected murder that took place early 
Monday in a parking garage at North Flor-ida Regional Medical Center and a subse-quent suicide.
At about 9 a.m., officers responded to a 
call reporting a dead woman on the third 
floor of the parking garage, according to a 
GPD news release.
Officers found 37-year-old Casey Renee 
Wilsey of Bronson, Fla., dead in her car, likely from a stab wound to her torso, ac-cording to the release.
Police reported that Walker Gage 
Wilsey, 46, the woman’s estranged hus-band, attacked Casey Renee Wilsey in her car sometime between 8:15 and 8:30 a.m. He then fled the scene in a pickup truck.
The department asked several Florida 
law enforcement agencies to check out the 
multiple addresses listed on file for Wilsey.At about 3:30 p.m., the Daytona Beach 
Police Department discovered Wilsey dead 
at a home in Daytona Beach, according to 
the release. 
Police reported he committed suicide.
UF criminology senior C.J. Wittus said 
he was on his way to AT&T to meet his managers when he noticed something was off.

As the demand for counseling services 
increases, the UF Counseling & Wellness 
Center has developed new ways to serve the needs of the Student Body.
The center’s administration officials in-
creased the number of individual annual counseling sessions by 
more than 350 to combat the demand, but they’ve also looked to technology to fill the gap.
CWC clinical psychol-
ogist Jennifer Alonso said the center typically has a waiting list twice a year. Midway through both the 
Fall and Spring semesters, counselors usual-ly reach workload capacity and begin a wait-
ing list, which they try to cap at 50 students 
to ensure that everyone receiving treatment receives an adequate number of sessions.
“That is our gut problem,” associate di-
rector Shari Robinson said. “Once we get to the end of the semester, we get saturated. All of our counselors are completely full.”
She said the average full-time counselor UF counseling center balances demand, staffSEAN STEWART-MUNIZ

Students can expect to dole out ex-
tra cash for the upcoming Summer B 
semester after UF’s fee committee vot-
ed to increase student fees.
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, assistant vice 
president of student affairs for UF and 
chair of the university’s fee committee, 
said the activity and service fee was 
raised 84 cents, and the student health fee was raised 82 cents. The athletic fee wasn’t changed.
Mastrodicasa said 
the extra revenue from student fees is largely going toward raises for faculty. While 
some UF personnel 
are paid through state funding, salaries of employees at campus 
organizations like GatorWell and the 
Department of Recreational Sports are 
made up of fees.
For the first time in roughly six 
years, the university mandated that all 
staff receive raises, including a 3-per-
cent salary bump for auxiliary staff ef-fective in October — but that meant the organizations had to come up with the cash on their own.
“It’s just the way that the money 
works,” Mastrodicasa said. “It’s part of running a business.”
Along with the required raises, she 
said fees were also raised because of a Student fees

Despite a losing football season and rival 
Florida State University’s championship 
win, UF students, alumni and fans have 
turned to social media to strengthen the 
Gator Nation.
Using the hashtag #GatorFollowTrain, 
users have been reaching out to fellow 
Gators to gain Twitter followers and 
following others doing the same since the beginning of January. 
It is unclear where the trend began, 
but the effort to connect Gators gained 
exposure as prominent accounts like university athletes, Albert the Alligator 
and the ofﬁ  cial UF Twitter account became involved. 
“It was one of the bigger social media 
things I’ve seen in a while in terms of a hashtag event,” said Bruce Floyd, UF social media specialist. “It was fun to actually be a part of that.”
Floyd, who runs the university’s Twitter 
account @UFlorida, said he tweeted “O hai #GatorFollowTrain!” when he ﬁ  rst noticed the trend, when Jan. 3.
He then continued to interact with users, 
asking how many followers people had gained so far and attempting to spread the movement to other social media platforms such as Instagram and Vine.
Floyd said he thinks the trend gained 
momentum when the UF account entered the discussion, thanks to the account’s 
prominence.
There have been more than 13,000 
tweets including the hashtag, according to 
Twitter analytics website Topsy.com. 
Lauren Moore, a 20-year-old UF public 
relations senior, began participating in the Gator Follow Train after she saw the UF account tweet about the trend. 
“I thought it was really cool to see 
everyone from around the world tweeting 
the Gator Follow Train because they’re 
Gator fans, or they are Gator alumni or Gator students or hopeful Gator students,” she said. 
Maya Iyyani, a 20-year-old UF 
psychology junior and Florida Cicerone, said social media has been important in connecting past, present and future Gators.
“The UF motto is, ‘The Gator Nation is 
everywhere,’” she said, “and social media really encompasses that.”#GatorFollowTrain boosts morale among students, alumni

ORLANDO — SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. said Mon-
day that it expects to report 2013 revenue of about $1.46 bil-
lion for the year, which it says would mark an annual record 
for the theme park operator.
SeaWorld said the results were driven by record fourth-
quarter attendance at its parks in San Diego, Orlando and 
San Antonio.
The Orlando-based company made the announcement 
amid increased scrutiny of its business following the criti-
cal documentary “Blackﬁ  sh,” which was released last year. The movie explores what may have caused a 12,000-pound 
orca named Tilikum to kill veteran SeaWorld trainer Dawn 
Brancheau in 2010.
The documentary argues that killer whales, when in cap-
tivity, become more aggressive to humans and each other.
The movie raised some concerns that attendance at its 
park would suffer and prompted several recording artists to pull out of a concert series at one of its parks.
SeaWorld has defended its practices. It took out newspa-
per ads that said the marine park company hasn’t taken a 
wild killer whale into captivity for 35 years due to its success-
ful breeding program. 
It also said that SeaWorld doesn’t separate killer whale 
mothers and calves and that the company has invested $70 
million over the past three years in its parks’ killer whale habitats. The company also characterized the ﬁ  lm in a state-
ment this summer as “shamefully dishonest, deliberately 
misleading, and scientiﬁ  cally inaccurate.”SeaWorld proﬁ  ts upmeets with about five clients a day.
Once the waiting list is closed, 
students who contact the CWC 
seeking assistance are informed that no regular appointment times 
are available and encouraged to 
make use of group therapy, the Dis-abilities Resource Center or licensed psychologists in the surrounding Gainesville area, Alonso said.
“It is troubling that some stu-
dents are not able to be seen regu-larly,” she said.
UF finance sophomore Caroline Sorel, 19, sought assistance at the CWC last Fall after the rigor of her classwork made her stressed and anxious.
She said the center was unable 
to offer her an appointment for four weeks.
“It was disappointing because I 
couldn’t see someone when I need-ed them most,” Sorel said. “They are not effective if they can only see you per three to four weeks.”
When Kate Logan, a 21-year-old 
UF elementary education senior, went to the center for an assessment appointment, she was told individ-ual counseling had a long waiting 
list. However, staff referred her to 
an outside provider that accepted her insurance.
“I had a good experience,” she 
said. “UF was very helpful with helping me find an affordable pro-vider.”
Alonso cites insufficient funds 
as one of the core reasons for the CWC’s inability to meet clinical de-mands on campus. 
During the 2011-2012 school 
year, 83 percent of the center’s fund-ing came from tuition health fees.
Last year, the center served 4,736 
students — 450 less than 2012.
In order to serve more Gators, 
staff introduced new online coun-seling options during the 2012-2013 school year.
Self-help program The Desk of-
fers interactive resources for stu-dents facing typical concerns that plague students during their college years.
Therapist Assisted Online, 
known as TAO, allows students to speak to counselors through weekly video chat sessions and complete daily mood logs on an iPhone app. 
It is the first of its kind to be de-
veloped and researched at the col-lege and university level in the U.S.
The seven-week program in-
cludes self-led interactive exercises and discussion forums. 
Brian Shaw, a counselor at the 
CWC, said setting up a meeting time each week can be challenging for busy students.
“So much of students’ lives now 
are online socially, even with class-es,” he said. “Having this online is convenient for them.”� USA TODAY DID NOT

Coffee? Check. Bagel? In 
hand. Morning newspaper? 
Get it on campus.
UF students can once again 
start their mornings by reading 
free copies of The New York 
Times.
Under the leadership of Stu-
dent Body President Christina Bonarrigo, UF’s Student Gov-ernment reinstated the campus newspaper readership program for the Spring semester. It will cost $13,500, according to the 
contractual agreement. 
Bonarrigo said bringing the 
program back was her personal 
project. She worked during Fall to reinstate it, and the agree-ment was signed in mid-No-vember.
“It was important because 
it was something students had expressed interest for, and I wanted to make sure to main-tain the service to students,” Bonarrigo said.
Papers will be delivered 
every weekday through April 23 except on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and during Spring 
Break.
Students can also read the 
news online, as the readership 
program also includes 325 digi-tal academic passes for each day. Each pass is good for 24 hours, and students must use their UF emails to sign up. 
UF Society of Professional 
Journalists chapter president Ayana Stewart said she’s glad the program is back. She previ-ously saw many students read-ing the Times in class.
“I know that it’s definitely 
something that students take advantage of,” said Stewart, a 20-year-old UF journalism ju-
nior.
The campus readership pro-
gram previously included USA 
Today as well. The program was suspended in May 2012 due to an outstanding debt of nearly $30,000, according to Al-ligator archives.
This past Summer, the Stu-
dent Senate amended the fis-cal year 2013-2014 activity and service fee budget and reduced the allocation for the readership program by $23,000. The new amount, $27,173, was designat-ed for digital subscriptions.
Also this Summer, the Sen-
ate approved the 2014-2015 ac-
tivity and service fee budget, 
which eliminated funds for the program entirely.
Bonarrigo said she’s not sure 
what the future of the program holds because that’s up to the next SG executive officers.

WESLEY CHAPEL, Fla. — An ar-
gument over texting in a Florida movie 
theater Monday triggered a retired Tampa police captain to fatally shoot a man sitting in front of him, as about 25 
horrified moviegoers looked on, sher-
iff’s officials said.
“Somebody throws popcorn. I’m 
not sure who threw the popcorn,” said Charles Cummings, who, as a birthday treat, was about to watch the movie “Lone Survivor” at The Grove 16 The-ater.
“And then bang, he was shot.”
Curtis Reeves, 71, has been charged 
with second-degree murder, and it’s 
not immediately clear whether he has retained an attorney.
Pasco County Sheriff’s officials said 
the shooting happened when Reeves asked 43-year-old Chad Oulson to stop texting at the theater in Wesley Cha-pel, a suburb about a half hour north of downtown Tampa.
Reeves and his wife were sitting be-
hind Oulson and his wife. Oulson told Reeves that he was texting with his 3-year-old daughter, Cummings said.
“It ended almost as quickly as it 
started,” said sheriff’s spokesman Doug Tobin. The sheriff’s office says an off-duty Sumter County deputy de-tained Reeves until police arrived.
Authorities said Reeves took out a 
gun, and Oulson’s wife put her hand over her husband, and that’s when Reeves fired his weapon, striking Nic-hole Oulson in the hand and her hus-band in the chest.
Oulson and his wife were taken by 
ambulance to a Tampa-area hospital where Chad Oulson died, Tobin said. His wife’s injuries weren’t considered 
life-threatening.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2014

UF Student Government has reinstated the availability of free issues of The New York Times 
after a brief suspension stemming from an outstanding debt of nearly $30,000.
SG makes free New York Times 
program reappear on campus  STATE
Committee has four students
student enrollment dip from 2013-2014. 
With fewer students taking courses, rev-enue from credit hours also drops. En-
rollment is projected to decrease again 
for the 2014-2015 school year.
She said by state statute, the univer-
sity’s fee committee is only allowed to raise local fees by 5 percent yearly. This year’s cap totaled $1.66.
The committee, which met twice in 
October, voted on presentations from campus organizations asking for a per-centage increase, she said.
She said four students and three 
faculty members make up the commit-tee, with Mastrodicasa acting as a tie-breaker. The students are recommended 
by the Student Body president, and the 
vice president of student affairs makes the faculty recommendations. UF Presi-dent Bernie Machen has the final say for 
appointments.
She said because UF’s athletic depart-
ment has a history of being successful, 
the committee rarely asks for a fee in-
crease. UF’s $1.90 athletic fee is relative-
ly small compared to FAMU’s $13.97, or University of West Florida’s $20.88.
Hayden Kemp, a 21-year-old UF po-litical science senior, said the 82-cent and 84-cent increases might not seem like a lot, but with tuition and other ex-
penses growing, the costs add up.
She said although the faculty de-
serves raises, if the fee increase benefit-
ted students instead, she would happily pay it.
 “It just means more money students 
are going to have to pay,” Kemp said.

� ABOUT 13,000 CHILDREN 
HAVE BEEN VACCINATED.
LYNNA LAWRENCE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Even though this flu season has 
brought an increase in life-threat-
ening cases to Alachua County, the health department provided vacci-nations for a record number of the 
county’s children. 
About 13,000 K-12 students in 
the county’s private and public 
schools have taken advantage of free flu vaccinations, “the most successful vaccination campaign in the history of the program,” said Paul Myers, administrator of the Florida Department of Health in Alachua County.
Although figures are still being 
gathered, Alachua County Pub-
lic Schools spokeswoman Jackie 
Johnson said school board officials “have not seen any sort of a spike in flu or flu-like illnesses among our students,” a factor she credits to the vaccination program.
Myers said the overall number 
of reported infections is compa-rable to past years.
“But the severity of the cases is what has us concerned right now,” he added.
Since October, UF Health Shands Hospital has reported 12 flu-related deaths. Five of those patients were under 40 years old, a greater number than usual, My-ers said.
Due to the increase in deadly 
flu cases shown in younger pa-
tients, Myers said, it is especially 
important for UF students to get vaccinated.
“Particularly when you’re 
talking about living in very close quarters, whether it’s in a dorm, apartments or fraternity or soror-ity houses, the flu has a great op-portunity to be transmitted,” My-
ers said. Lindsey Jones, a 19-year-old UF 
psychology sophomore, said she 
gets the flu vaccine regularly. She received her vaccine from a local Walgreens this month.
“I was really scared,” Jones said. 
“The news has been reporting a lot

� UF WILL LAUNCH A 
MASTER’S DEGREE  CONCENTRATION IN SUMMER.

After completing the first online 
certificate in shelter medicine in 
the world, UF graduates are ready 
to unleash their newfound skills on 
homeless pets.
About 30 veterinarians and vet-
erinary students recently gradu-
ated from UF Maddie’s Online 
Graduate Certificate Shelter Medi-cine Program.
Terry Spencer, Maddie’s clini-
cal assistant professor of shelter 
medicine and distance learning di-
rector, said the program started in 2012 to provide students with the skills needed to assist shelters with 
the health and welfare of homeless 
animals.
“When I graduated in 1995, no 
one even mentioned shelter medi-cine,” Spencer said. “Now it’s re-
ally burgeoning.”
Classes provided by the pro-
gram cover topics such as diagnos-
ing infectious diseases common in shelters, recognizing animal cru-
elty and identifying problematic 
animal behavior. 
Students are not required to be 
enrolled at UF.
Degrees cost about $5,000 and 
take about a year to complete if a student took one class a semester, she said.“They can’t get this training 
anywhere else,” Spencer said. “What they learned in these cours-es has changed how they handle 
animals.”
Past students range from vet-
erinarians with private practices 
assisting shelters in their area to students being employed by shel-
ters in different countries, Spencer 
said.
Ken Sieranski, a 26-year-old UF 
Maddie’s Shelter Medicine intern, 
was a part of the first group of 
students to graduate in December with the online program.
“I would love to see this pro-
gram spread across the country,” 
he said. “Students can get a foun-
dation that is not offered anywhere else.”
The online graduate program 
was started with the help of Mad-die’s Fund, which provided more than $5 million for the UF’s Mad-die’s Shelter Medicine Program in 2008.
Amie Burling, Maddie’s Shelter 
Medicine resident, said more vet-erinarians need to be educated on shelter medicine.
“So many new advances have 
been made in ways to raise the lev-el of care and welfare of animals,” Burling said. “It’s a matter of get-ting information out to the people 
on the field.”
Spencer said she expects many 
students to proceed with their stud-
ies for a master’s degree concentra-
tion in shelter medicine, which UF 
will launch this summer.
She said the information stu-
dents retain from the online gradu-ate certificate program will help 
animals receive a positive outcome 
from shelters.
“If you were to think of the No. 
1 cause of mortality for animals, 
it’s having lived in animal shelters 
and homelessness,” she said. “We can do something about this.”Class graduates from

� THE SENSORS WILL BE WITHIN A 
MILE FROM SHORE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
JACKSONVILLE — Sensors will be dropped 
into the Atlantic Ocean off northeast Florida to 
help researchers track great white sharks.
Shark experts at the University of North 
Florida will be alerted whenever a great white 
shark that’s been tagged with a tracking device swims within a few hundred yards of one of 
the sensors. Researchers tell The Florida Times-
Union that devices will be placed on buoys 
within a mile from shore.
Last year, scientists tracked a 16 ½-foot great 
white near shore off Jacksonville Beach. A 14-foot great white was caught and tagged within sight of an Atlantic Beach park.
Researchers say data from the tracking de-
vices show that some great white sharks spend more time close to shore than they previously 
believed.Ocean sensors to track sharksCAMpus

Club Creole, the Hai-
tian student association on 
campus, held a candlelight memorial Monday night to commemorate the four-year 
anniversary of the 2010 earth-
quake that killed more than 220,000 people and left 1.5 mil-lion homeless. 
“It may not be in people’s 
minds anymore, but we want-ed to remember the many affected by it,” said Malissa Alinor, a 20-year-old UF soci-ology junior and president of Club Creole.
The event included a candle 
lighting ceremony, a poem re-cital and a rendition of the Hai-tian national anthem.
One of the students in at-
tendance, James Fertil, a 19-year-old UF political science freshman, was in Haiti during the earthquake.
“I was doing my home-
work, and the house started to shake,” he said. “The last thing I remember is that I just ran outside.”Fertil said the ceremony 
was a moving event to remem-ber lives lost.
“I feel like we were connect-
ed about something that hap-pened in the past,” he said.
But the effects of this trage-
dy are not just relegated to the past, said Ben Hebblethwaite, assistant professor of Haitian Creole and French.
“Four years later, we are 
working with a society that has 
been transformed by that natu-
ral disaster,”  Hebblethwaite said. “It’s woven into the fabric about dialogue about Haiti.”Vigil remembers Haiti earthquake“Particularly when you’re

effective advocacy 
journalism
In 2011, the creator of the MTV reality shows “16 and Preg-
nant” and “Teen Mom” wrote an article for CNN defending the show’s value in response to media critics claiming the 
two shows glamorize teen pregnancy.
“Three years ago, I was flipping through a magazine when 
I read an article that stopped me cold,” wrote Laura Dolgen, MTV’s senior vice president of series development on the West Coast. “Jamie Lynn Spears’ pregnancy was a lead story in the news, but this piece talked about the 750,000 other teenage girls who get pregnant each year in the U.S., the ones who were not from wealthy, famous families.”
Viewers who follow “Teen Mom” and “16 and Pregnant” — 
not, we might add, parents and older critics who never both-ered to watch the shows — know that MTV isn’t glamorizing 
teen pregnancy at all. The shows offer honest and often bleak 
portraits of the lives of young women who choose to keep their babies after accidental pregnancies. 
The show examines how the women’s lives play out after the 
babies are born: screaming matches with parents, drug prob-lems, lawsuits against the fathers, struggles to finish school and difficulty managing their personal finances are all commonplace problems for the girls in each episode. Glamorous, right?
According to The New York Times, a new economic study 
of Nielsen TV ratings and birth records show that areas with a high viewership of MTV programming saw a rapid decline in the rate of teen births. The study focused on the period after “16 and Pregnant” was introduced in 2009. Although correlation doesn’t necessarily mean causation, researchers who reviewed the study said the conclusion seems sound. 
Despite sensationalized claims that copycat pregnancies 
were inevitable, Dolgen maintained that she created the show to illustrate a cautionary tale to young American women, and she 
refused to allow copycats to appear on the show. Besides, young 
women, as these numbers show, are much more observant and intelligent than the mainstream media gives them credit for. While so-called pregnancy pacts make for juicy feature stories, the reality is that MTV has sparked an important national dis-cussion: one among teens about the importance of contraception and responsible sexual health. 
Even the Media Research Center begrudgingly admitted that 
MTV didn’t shy away from the gritty details of the lives of “16 
and Pregnant” and “Teen Mom” subjects. Although MTV isn’t 
exactly NPR or PBS, the network that brought young adults the beloved trashy reality shows “Jersey Shore” and the long-run-ning “Real World” series has used its influence to deliver smart advocacy journalism packaged as a teen-friendly reality show — complete with sketchbook fonts and a cute intro song. 
Sure, the show isn’t perfect. The antics of “Teen Mom” and 
“16 and Pregnant’s” stars appear regularly on the covers of tab-loids, but it’s fundamentally wrong and unfair to assume that 
all — or even most — young American women aspire to achieve 
reality-TV fame.

For gyms, the most wonderful time of year follows 
closely after Christmas.
Memberships are sold to blindingly eager peo-
ple who are convinced this New Year is just the turning point they need to change.
But the significance of the New Year is an illusion. 
It’s not what’s going to propel you into a new way of 
living. 
By March, the gym is still going to be collecting 
monthly fees for that membership you no longer use.
Instead of making lofty goals at the beginning of the 
year that just end up turning into ways you feel you have failed at life a couple of months later, decide to 
make changes for yourself at your own pace. 
Though a festive occasion may seem like a great way 
to ring in your resolutions, it can emphasize more of 
the spirit and the idea of change rather than the actual 
follow-through.
Making goals with all of the pomp and circumstance 
are often done more for the benefit of impressing other people than for making a personal commitment to your-
self.
Don’t give the New Year the power to be an excuse 
for you to put off making yourself a better person. 
Once you’ve decided to make new habits, make sure 
they are reasonable and are for you alone. 
If your resolution involves some kind of diet routine, 
please keep it to yourself. 
No one wants to hear about how many calories are 
in the food you’re eating; that subject has gotten as tire-some as mustaches on things and bacon in sweets.
I like to make my goals small, specific and achiev-
able. 
I also tell myself not to expect too many noticeable 
results in a short time. 
Studies differ on how long it takes to make or break 
a habit, from three weeks to more than 200 days, but basically, it may be a challenge 
to one’s Netflix-speed-adapted expectations.
I also try to be honest with 
myself when I am making 
goals. 
It’s weird, but you can lie to yourself, be really gull-
ible and believe what you tell yourself.
Instead of telling myself to go to every single class 
period this semester, because, honestly, I know that will never happen, I’ve made a resolution to go to the classes that take attendance and take advantage of the allotted 
excused absences. 
If I went with the first resolution, I would never suc-
ceed, and I would just feel like I’ve failed myself.
Not every resolution has to sound like it came from 
a self-help book or an inspirational poster hanging in a 
guidance counselor’s office. 
Goals can be fun and seemingly silly. I made a point a couple of years ago to start giving 
people the compliments I used to think but keep to my-
self. 
People like hearing that you like their shoes, hair or 
smile. I mean, they don’t tell me that I am creeping them 
out.
Though it’s Jan. 14, and you may have already for-
gotten or abandoned your resolutions, or you never made any this year and think it’s too late, it’s not. 
Of course, society probably needs people to not fol-
low through with their resolutions. 
Otherwise, fast-food restaurants would close, the 
economy would crash, and lifestyle magazines would be pulled off the shelves. 
If you don’t want to be the American stereotype, it’s 
never too late.

The ﬁ  lm “12 Years a Slave” was painful and 
poignant, slightly heartwarming and incred-ibly heartbreaking. It resonated in a way only 
a ﬁ  lm about race can. But therein lies the problem.
Don’t get me wrong; I enjoyed “The Hunger 
Games: Catching Fire.” The second Hunger Games movie left me satiated. Still, using box ofﬁ  ce numbers as a measure of a ﬁ  lm’s success, there is a massive gap between “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” and “12 Years a Slave” that is less than heartening: Over the course of its nearly three-month run, “12 Years a Slave” grossed about $39 million, a smidge more than half  what “Catching Fire” made on opening weekend. 
Keeping in mind the massive critical acclaim for everything 
from the ﬁ  lm’s cinematography to the acting, not to mention 
the harrowing true story itself, we may be tempted to ask: Why 
hasn’t “12 Years a Slave” been a runaway success?
Some would counter that it is. To be fair to Hollywood, 
America and Brad Pitt, the parallel between “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire’s” box ofﬁ  ce performance and that of a ﬁ  lm like “12 Years a Slave” is slightly unfair: The former is an action ﬁ  lm based on a critically acclaimed book series published within the past decade while the latter is a serious drama based on Solomon Northup’s ﬁ  rst-person account of his experience 
published more than a century prior. Still, that’s not to say the 
same phenomena isn’t present in the box ofﬁ  ce performance of other contemporary ﬁ  lms. 
“Captain Phillips,” “Gravity,” “Blue Jasmine” and “Prison-
ers,” comparable ﬁ  lms that have come out around the same time period, have done markedly better than “12 Years a Slave.” Even compared to the reception of other historical ﬁ  lms of re-cent memory — “Lincoln,” “JFK,” “Schindler’s List” and even “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter” — “12 Years a Slave’s” 
numbers simply don’t compare.
It is incredibly unusual for a movie about slavery to be pro-
duced, much less received with critical open arms. 
“Django Unchained,” a recent exception to the unspoken 
moratorium on slave ﬁ  lms, was less a serious drama and more 
a quintessential Quentin shoot-em-up ﬁ  lm that just happened to focus on black folk during the time of slavery. The last time any work of this magnitude was created was in 1977, when 
“Roots” ﬁ  rst aired on television. 
This large time gap in cinema about black slavery, coupled 
with the fact that this sort of ﬁ  lm tends to do better abroad than 
in the U.S., begs the question: Is America simply not yet willing to confront the memory of slavery?
Race has long been, and continues to be, a sensitive subject 
in the hearts and minds of the American public. Discussion of 
race in our political discourse is conﬁ  ned to the outskirts of 
mainstream media — read: the wonderful folks over at MSN-
BC — and Americans are so obsessed with being colorblind 
that liberals and conservatives alike can be known to reject 
frank discussions of the issue. The GOP seems to think that racism is dead, 
and to address issues affecting minorities is to “play the race card.” We are so squeamish about race that “12 Years a Slave,” a ﬁ  lm set in the U.S. about American slavery, was created by an Eng-
lishman. It’s plain to see that we — both American ﬁ  lm viewers and ﬁ  lm producers — aren’t ready for an honest discussion of our most painful memory as a society. The question is, when will we be?
Part of the problem is that the effects of slavery in America, 
one of the last industrialized nations to abolish the institution, are still felt strongly today. For Americans — black, white and in between — the memory of the institution is made worse by the persistence of its racist legacies. One only needs to look at 
political discourse in certain circles — read: the far right — to 
realize that issues of racial animosity and the perceived infe-riority of African Americans, a result of hundreds of years of societal subjugation, are as pertinent today as they have been in the past. 
There is a reason why the GOP has a large demographics 
problem and why Mitt Romney lost 83 percent of the “non-white” vote in 2012. There is a reason why efforts at preventing voting fraud seem to disproportionately affect minorities and 
why stop-and-frisk programs have delved into little more than 
thinly veiled racial proﬁ  ling. 
There is a reason why the Trayvon Martin case was so in-
credibly divisive. There is a reason why the Voting Rights Act, passed 100 years after the abolition of slavery, remains neces-sary to ensure the enfranchisement of minorities, especially in the Deep South, the setting of “12 Years a Slave.” There is a reason why, immediately following the overturning of this landmark law, Republican legislatures took divisive actions 
to show the Supreme Court that its determination was dead 
wrong.
To be fair, while we haven’t seen a frank movie about slav-
ery in recent decades, we have seen a few great ﬁ  lms about race in recent years, including “The Butler,” “Fruitvale Station” and “42.” 
Still, we haven’t gotten to a comfortable point in our dis-
course, and achieving that goal takes more than a ﬁ  lm from 
Steve McQueen or a rousing speech from Hillary Clinton about 
the memory of Trayvon Martin. To truly move past race in this country, we need more than the great image a black president gives us; we need more than an elected black senator from New Jersey. We need to be able to talk frankly without pretense or offense. We need to be able to discuss the effects of race in the present as much as in our collective past. 
We’ve got a long way to go. Although the box ofﬁ  ce perfor-
mance of “12 Years a Slave” is a sign we aren’t there yet, the 
existence of the ﬁ  lm suggests we might be on our way.

My mom had an interesting habit. Every 
morning, she’d take the previous night’s leftover rice and dump it in a corner of 
our lawn for the neighborhood ducks.
And boy, the ducks 
loved her. After snap-ping up all the rice, they trotted around the door for an hour or so, hoping my mom would come out again. And they never forgot to — this is what got my dad upset — excrete all over our 
front porch.
Slowly, my sympathies shifted to my dad. Ev-
ery morning, after hosing the poop stains off the 
porch, he came in and pleaded with my mom to stop feeding the ducks: “You’re only encouraging them to come more often!”
Once my mom halted the daily meals, the birds 
stopped loitering in our yard. They were able to scavenge food from elsewhere. After all, ducks 
are used to the wilderness.
My dad’s logic is often applied to homeless 
people. Increasingly, the needy are likened to 
ducks: “If you keep giving ‘em meals, they’ll keep coming. Let them fend for themselves.”
This logic — I use the word “logic” loosely — 
of demanding the poor to “toughen up” isn’t just held by some Ayn Rand followers fond of hating on panhandlers.
Take Florida, considered the “most dangerous 
state to be homeless” by countless media outlets. In Orlando, you can be thrown in jail if you give food to too many homeless individuals too often. This is no joke; volunteers were arrested in an Orlando park in 2011 for handing out meals to hungry folks.
Tampa one-upped O-Town with new laws 
prohibiting homeless people from sleeping or 
storing their stuff in public spaces. This comes at 
a time when existing homeless shelters are at full capacity.
Let’s put aside city ordinances and focus on 
something more basic. Since Adam and Eve, we’ve pretty much agreed that human beings de-pend on each other, for better or worse. Living in a society means we have each other’s backs in rough times.
Homeless people aren’t ducks. Actually, 
they’re not even much different from you and I — with just one unlucky stretch of unemployment in our future careers, we could join the homeless.
If you’ve ever had a chance to see the folks 
who sleep in downtown Gainesville, you’ll rec-ognize that many of them suffer from chronic ill-nesses and substance abuse. For others, domestic violence has wrecked their lives.
Instead of building comprehensive rehab cen-
ters, government ofﬁ  cials have opted to criminal-ize poverty.
But laws don’t come down from the heavens. 
After hearing last year about how some South Floridians complained about a group of nuns who publicly feed hungry folks, Miami residents became “afraid of the homeless” crowding on a sidewalk, according to the Miami Herald. It’s 
time we look inward. We can’t just blame politi-
cians.
The homeless have become untouchables. This 
new caste system, the envy of my Hindu ances-tors, is entirely our doing. Rarely do we, includ-ing myself, take a break to think about how un-imaginably grueling conditions are where the poor folks are kept.
As the age-old saying goes, “A society is mea-
sured by how it treats its weakest members.”
Should we then not aid those brothers and sis-
ters of ours who shufﬂ  e around in castaway cor-ners and shadows not too far from us?

California became the ﬁ  rst state 
to enact a law concerning transgen-
der student rights on Jan. 1. As more universities strive to be more inclu-sive, UF’s policies for its transgender students are still developing.
The California law states that any 
public school programs and facili-
ties for grades K-12 must be open to 
all students, meaning they may use any restroom or locker room they feel comfortable with, regardless of gender identity.
UF’s non-discrimination policy 
currently promotes equal opportu-nities for all of its students, includ-ing those of all gender identities and expressions.
“Policies and practices don’t al-
ways align as neatly as they could,” said LB Hannahs, UF director of LGBT affairs. “And I think often when we make big policies, the 
on-the-ground changes we need to 
make can be difﬁ  cult.”
Some students say these chang-
es, however minor, are necessary to promote a better campus environ-ment for all students.
Andrew Sun, a 21-year-old UF 
political science senior and director for the pride mentor program for 
incoming LGBT students, said more unisex bathrooms on campus would 
be a start.
“If you don’t look male or fe-
male, you can get kicked out of the bathrooms,” he said, “and there are a lot of people that that happens to on a daily basis.”
Sun said that the lack of gender-
neutral housing on campus can make transgender and other gender-afﬁ  liated students uncomfortable.
“In order for you to not live with 
an assigned sex, you have to have a medical condition,” he said.
Sun said he personally faced the 
challenge of living with a roommate whose gender he did not identify with during his sophomore year.
In an effort to combat situations 
like these, 22-year-old UF women’s studies senior Marla Munro, former 
president of Gators Coalition for an 
Inclusive Campus, worked last year to promote gender-neutral hous-ing, which would allow students to choose roommates of any gender.
The coalition has since dissolved, 
but she said her team raised campus discussion and paved the way for a new committee called Open Hous-
ing to be created in UF’s Housing 
and Residence Education Depart-ment.
“Gender-neutral housing makes 
the environment a little more friend-ly and inclusive,” Munro said.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2014

With a new year comes change, and Colo-
rado is following suit by turning over a differ-
ent kind of leaf.
On Jan. 1, Colorado became the ﬁ  rst state 
to legally allow licensed pot shops to sell the 
drug. Many residents in Gainesville are sup-
porting Colorado’s new law and participating in securing a similar future for Florida.
Morgan and Morgan law ﬁ  rm partner and 
marijuana advocate John Morgan said Colo-rado didn’t see any signiﬁ  cant changes when the law passed.
“They legalized it, and the world didn’t 
end. There were no lightning bolts coming 
from the sky, and not one person got crazy on 
marijuana and robbed a bank,” said Morgan, chairman of United for Care, an organization sponsoring a petition to put medical marijua-na legislation on the state ballot.
Though the petition still has to pass 
through the Supreme Court, Morgan said he’s 
conﬁ  dent about it.
“If it gets on the ballot, it’s going to pass,” 
he said. “Our attorney general is going to see 
she’s living in the Dark Ages.”
Representatives from United for Care have 
recently been visiting UF’s campus to collect signatures from supportive students.
One of those students is Alex Gimble, a 19-
year-old UF political science sophomore who 
said he hopes to see Florida follow in Colo-
rado’s footsteps.
“I deﬁ  nitely support it and think the way 
they implement it — in particular, the way the taxes go toward education — was done well,” he said. “I think there’s a timeline on it as things start to normalize. It’ll start to happen in stages, like most social changes, and eventu-ally will be adopted across the country.”
Gimble said he thinks that those who don’t 
support legalizing marijuana are concerned about the industry becoming too large-scale.The regulations permit residents older than 
21 to purchase one ounce of marijuana every time they enter a pot shop and tourists of the 
same age to buy a quarter of an ounce, accord-
ing to the Colorado legislation.
Kristen Burns, president of the student club 
National Organization for the Reform of Mari-juana Laws, or NORML Gators, said the ben-eﬁ  ts of legalized marijuana are numerous.
“The crime rate will go down substan-
tially,” she wrote in an email. “There will be a huge inﬂ  ux of tax money to help the economy, and people will have access to a drug that is 
safer and less harmful than alcohol and to-
bacco.”Burns said she believes it could be legalized 
in Florida if those who are educated continue to spread their opinions.
“The issues lie in the misled people who 
perpetuate the myths surrounding marijuana use,” she said. “The ‘reefer madness’ mental-ity is still present in some older members of the community, so re-educating these people with correct information is crucial.”
Although some residents provide lists of 
positive aspects of legalization, others are op-posed to the idea.
Ronald Akers, a UF professor in both the 
sociology and the criminology and law de-partments, said that new laws are often syn-onymous with unexpected repercussions.
The legalization in Colorado will be no dif-
ferent, he said.
“Any time you pass legislation … there’s 
going to be unintended consequences, and of-ten, they are going to be negative,” he said. “I 
don’t know if it is intended. One consequence 
is almost certainly that there will be more mar-ijuana use.” Colorado marijuana law ignites discussion in Gainesville

SPRING HILL, Fla. — A deer

The Tampa Bay Times reported  that Vinny was removed from Sur-vival Outreach Sanctuary in Spring Hill on Monday by the Florida Fish

On Friday, the 75-year-old sister 
of the sanctuary’s owner was at-tacked by the deer. Doctors removed the woman’s right eye. She remains hospitalized.
A week before the deer attack, 
one of the sanctuary’s lionesses dug out of her cage. Savannah never made it off the sanctuary’s fenced-in property, but her escape attempt made national news. The sanctu-
ary’s owner received a misdemean-

Manuel Zelaya and 23-year-old Daniel Zelaya, run the ﬂ  eet of 12 employees who race around town collecting and delivering orders.
“Nothing like this exists in Gainesville, so we thought 
that the Gainesville community could really, really ben-
eﬁ  t from this,” said Manuel Zelaya.
It takes a few steps: Sign in online, order items, indi-
cate where the items should be delivered and conﬁ  rm. It 
costs $7 for a scheduled delivery of up to 10 items from one store, and it includes stores like Wal-Mart, Target, Sears, CVS and Walgreens. 
For students like Christy Marcroft, a 19-year-old UF 
history freshman, the service is a stress reliever. 
“It’s hard to go to the grocery store and bring the gro-
ceries on the bus on the way back,” Marcroft said.
She said freshmen living on campus will probably 
beneﬁ  t the most from the service.
“They probably don’t have a car, and some of them 
are probably too nervous to take the bus,” Marcroft said.
The company’s management team agreed its business 
model was inspired by students’ needs, but it can also help other residents, such as busy parents. 
“You’re buying time to have more time to study or see 
your kid at the soccer game,” Manuel Zelaya said.
He said a Lazy Delivery app will launch by Friday.New service

Gator scores for national team
Gators forward Savannah Jordan scored her third 
goal of the CONCACAF U-20 tournament in the USA’s 10-0 win against Guatemala on Monday.Coach Will Muschamp announced the injury status of several Gators on Monday. Read the story on page 16. ADAM PINCUS

Kurt Roper walked into the 
South End Zone Meeting Room 
in black slacks, black shoes and a 
blue Florida Gators jacket. At 41, 
his glasses and bald head made him look like the cool, yet insight-ful, college professor.
He answered questions fol-
lowing Will Muschamp’s state of the program address in which the lights ironically went dark, a press conference with new of-
fensive line coach Mike Summers 
and a session with new special teams coordinator Coleman Hut-zler that included his preference 
for New Mexico chili peppers.
His first words at the press con-
ference as offensive coordinator: 
“Surely there can’t be any ques-tions left.” With all due respect, 
Mr. Roper, when the Gators fin-
ish 4-8 and have an offense that finishes last in the Southeastern Conference, there will be more 
questions, and lots of them.
Roper comes way of Raleigh, 
N.C., where he served as Duke’s 
offensive coordinator under quarterback messiah David Cut-
cliffe, who famously coached the 
Manning brothers at Tennessee and Ole Miss. 
For a Florida fan base that 
hasn’t had a quarterback to wor-ship since Tim Tebow, a coach like Roper may be the answer to its prayers.
“You lose a couple of guys in 
your system and you’re in trou-
ble, so you’ve got to be able to 
shift gears and change to what fits your personnel,” Muschamp said. 
“I think his background speaks 
for itself as far as being a two-back team at Ole Miss, and now you’re looking at Duke and a lot of the spread principles we need 
to look at.”
After seeing the high-octane at-
tacks of Auburn and Florida State 
in Pasadena, Calif., Muschamp 
needed to make a philosophi-
cal shift from the run-dominated thinking of your father’s time to the spread offenses of your iP-hone-wielding younger brother. 
Times are changing, and now 
it appears Florida is, too.Roper, who has worked with 
Cutcliffe in some capacity for 17 seasons, has run both a spread and pro-style system. Brent Pease, UF’s former offen-
sive coordinator, never rekindled the success he had at Boise State

For the second straight Southeast-
ern Conference game, the Gators will 
be without their leading scorer Casey Prather due to a bone bruise in his right knee. 
After sitting out No. 7 Florida’s 
(13-2, 2-0 SEC) overtime win in Ar-kansas on Saturday, the senior for-ward is still not healthy enough for tonight’s matchup against Georgia (8-6, 2-0 SEC) at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
“He still has issues,” coach Billy 
Donovan said. “He’s getting bet-
ter. He’s progressing. When he’ll be 
available to play, I don’t know, but he’s out (Tuesday).”Despite missing the 17 points per 
game Prather brings to the court, the Gators edged the Razorbacks 84-82 
behind Dorian Finney-Smith’s career-
high 22 points and Scottie Wilbekin’s 18 points, which tied a career high. 
“I would 
just say that we have an internal con-fidence as 
a team when it gets in those types of 
situations,” Wilbekin said. “We just 
have a confidence we’re going to pull it (through) especially after winning so many of those games. It just builds more confidence.”

A midweek bye is just what the doctor or-
dered. 
Coming off their first loss in 10 games, the 
Gators now have time to rest and tinker with 
their game this week. 
“You have to use your bye weeks really 
strategically, especially if you’re going to put 
in something new, maybe something you 
haven’t utilized as much that you kind of want to amp up a little bit,” coach Amanda Butler said. “Hopefully, we’ll get a chance to add a few wrinkles. The rest portion is really impor-
tant for us, so we’ll take two days off of our 
feet and start watching some film [Tuesday].”
Florida had a rough go on Sunday in Baton 
Rouge, La., losing to No. 12 LSU 82-68. 
In their past two games, the Gators have 
struggled shooting the ball. Florida has shot a combined 35.8 percent from the field in that stretch, well below their season average of 44.3 percent. Rather than make specific adjustments to a 
player’s shooting game, the only thing Butler can do is hope for the best. 
“How you shoot the ball 
is hard to adjust for,” Butler said. “I pray about it every night and every morning when I wake up. But other 
than maybe praying more 
about us hitting more shots, 
I don’t know how we can adjust to getting better 
shots.” 
Shooting is a player-specific entity. That is, 
what technique works for one player may not 
work for another. 
“We have to have a great understanding 
of what’s a good shot,” Butler said. “What’s the shot clock got on it? What’s the time and score of the overall game? We just need to make sure to make the best decisions. Jaterra 
(Bonds)’s good shot looks very different than Gators resting after streak ends

  When asked Monday about the 
NCAA’s handling of freshman 
forward Chris Walker’s eligibility, coach Billy Donovan paused for about ﬁ  ve seconds.
  “That’s a loaded question for 
me,” Donovan said, looking frus-trated.
  After another ﬁ  ve-second 
pause, he continued. 
  “Right now, I have hope and optimism that a kid that has been 
totally forthright and honest and 
truthful and has given everything he possibly could, that the NCAA 
will do the right thing, so to speak,” 
Donovan said.
  “I’m not involved with it. Like I said earlier, our administration is. I 
totally trust them to handle it.”
  The NCAA has left Walker, 
who enrolled at UF on Dec. 14, 
2013, once the fall semester ended, 
in limbo for about a month as it 
continues to evaluate his academic 
eligibility before making a ruling. Since he arrived on campus, Walk-
er, a ﬁ  ve-star recruit out of Boni-
fay, has missed all six of Florida’s 
contests and has only been able to 
practice with the team. 
  Walker has clearly been an-
noyed with the process, as he posted on his Twitter account (@cwalkertime23) on Jan. 3, “#FreeSkyWalker !” before eventu-ally deleting the tweet. Gators fans have shared similar frustration about the way the NCAA has han-dled the situation, and the hashtag has gained traction on social media websites.
  Meanwhile, the 6-foot-10, 
220-pound Walker has been trying 
to make up for lost time at prac-
tice. More experienced frontcourt 
players such as Patric Young and Will Yeguete during drills have dominated the freshman hailed by many as a phenom, according to Donovan. 
  “As practice has kind of unfold-
ed, I think he’s realized, ‘I’m not really ready to play,’” Donovan 
said of Walker. “It’s been a hum-
bling experience for him … in a positive way.
  “‘I may have talent, I may have 
ability,” Donovan continued, imi-
tating Walker’s thought process, 
“but I have no idea what we are doing out there right now and I 
have no idea what is going on. I 
don’t know how to guard a pick-
and-roll. There’s actions, there’s 
screenings, there’s pressing, this is like foreign to me right now.’ 
  “I think it’s been good he’s had 
some time to try and play catch-up 
a little bit right now. I think because 
of that maybe (he is) disappointed. He obviously wants to play. There 
is no question about it. But I also 
think he’s looking at it like, ‘Wow. 
I can get better through this.’”
  Walker’s ﬁ  rst month of practice 
may not have gone as smoothly as 
he would have expected, but his 
teammates have seen him gradual-
ly make improvements to his game 
as he awaits a ﬁ  nal verdict about his eligibility.
  “Freak of nature,” sophomore 
forward DeVon Walker said. “He’s 
athletic and he’s willing to learn. 
He’s getting better every day.”
  Added senior point guard Scot-
tie Wilbekin: “Yeah, he wants to 
play, but he knows it’s a process 
and he’s just kind of biding his 
time. He has the mindset of just doing whatever he can to help the team. And right now, that’s prac-ticing and just making the people 
who are playing better.” 14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2014

UF forwardovertime, Florida scored the most 
points against an SEC opponent since defeating Arkansas 98-68 on Feb. 18, 2012, which was the last time the Gators won in Fayette-
ville, Ark.
However, Florida State is the 
only school Florida has faced that 
has allowed fewer points than Georgia. The Bulldogs also rank among the top 20 in the nation in field goals allowed.
If the Gators are to extend their 
home winning streak to a school 
record 25 wins tonight, both 
Finney-Smith and Wilbekin will have to carry the load on offense as well as burn up some minutes on the court.
Without Prather, who averages 
28.7 minutes per game, Donovan was forced to start Finney-Smith for just the second time all season 
against Arkansas. Finney-Smith 
stayed in the game for a career-high 42 minutes. Wilbekin, who said he was playing at 80 to 90 percent because of a sprained right ankle, still had to play 35 minutes.
“He’s still sore,” Donovan said 
of his senior point guard. “He’s still dealing with some issues. He should be able to play (Tues-day).”
Contributing to Finney-Smith’s 
and Wilbekin’s extra playing time was the health of center Patric Young. The senior was limited due to tendinitis in his knees and played for just 21 minutes Satur-
day, including just 1:29 in over-
time before fouling out.
Donovan said Young practiced 
Sunday and Monday and should be a “full go” for tonight’s con-test.
Florida has been outrebound-
ed in its past two SEC matchups and will need a mobile Young 
to help Finney-Smith grab more 
boards. Finney-Smith recorded nine offensive rebounds against the Razorbacks, while no one else on the Gators collected more than one each. 
Donovan said his frontcourt 
will need to take advantage of more second chance opportuni-ties against the Bulldogs, who Donovan said have more offen-sive options this season than they did during their two losses to the Gators last year.
“They’re getting almost 15 of-fensive rebounds per game in their first two SEC games,” Dono-
van said. 
“With the way they run their 
offense, they’re always going to 
have their three, four and five relatively close to the basket, and they really do a great job of get-ting to the backboard and creat-ing offensive rebounds.”
Lily (Svete)’s good shot, looks very different than Kayla (Lewis)’s 
good shot. They’ve got to make their own plays. That’ll be some-thing we’ll continue to reinforce this week.”
The Gators’ trademark this season has been the team’s ability 
to have any player step up on any given night. 
The recent winning streak was proof of it.Lewis led the team with 19 points against St. Francis. Cassie 
Peoples put up 23 against Mississippi State. Against then-No. 6 Kentucky, Bonds scored 23 points. 
In those games, however, Florida shot 55.1, 46.8 and 49.1 per-
cent from the field, respectively.  
“You hope you shoot the ball well,” Butler said. “You hope 
you shoot the ball consistently. But, if you watch enough bas-ketball, it doesn’t matter how great of a shooting team you are. 
There’s going to be nights it doesn’t fall.”
The Gators are also without sophomore forward Christin 
Mercer, who has been suspended indefinitely. Mercer has been 
an integral part of Florida’s success so far this season, as she is second on the team in points (11.8) and third on the team in re-
bounds (5.8) per contest.
One could argue her absence on Sunday was tough to over-
come, as the Gators were outscored by 14 and outrebounded by a 
50-29 margin against LSU. 
“It’s hard to say,” Butler said on whether Mercer’s absence 
was a factor in the loss to LSU. “We’re just speculating. Certain-ly, having one less person in the rotation that we’re used to … 
you’ve got to account for that.”
“I really thought it was just a few folks having an off night. 
The slow start really hurt us.”TUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Roper working to improve anemic offense
that made him a hot-shot coordinator even Nick Sa-
ban couldn’t wait to hire.
Moving to Gainesville did come with a cost for 
Roper. 
He, his wife, Britt, daughter, Reese, and son, 
Luke, moved away from Roper’s brother Zac, who is the special teams coordinator for Duke. Zac has a 
wife and two kids as well. 
A chance to revitalize a team a year removed 
from the BCS and a program with as many national 
championships as Heisman Trophy winners was too good to pass up.
“One of the obvious mainstays in college foot-
ball,” Roper said about Florida. “This is a great uni-versity with a history and a lot of championships. The year before they went to the Sugar Bowl, so ob-
viously there’s a lot of good football players on this 
team. 
“It’s a chance to come and compete for champi-
onships.”
What Roper has to work with is uncertain, un-
proven and underperforming talent. Junior quarter-back Jeff Driskel comes off a fractured right fibula he suffered against Tennessee on Sept. 21. 
Freshman Will Grier, who worked with Roper at 
Duke quarterback camps, is an unknown commod-ity. 
Sophomore running back Matt Jones is missing 
spring practice while recovering from a torn left meniscus. The search for a major contributor at re-ceiver is ongoing. 
The offensive line is missing parts, while the tight 
ends are missing altogether.
There’s much to figure out in 15 spring practices, 
a summer and fall training camp, but by all indica-tions, the man who learned from one of the best is ready.foot , from page 13

UF coach� CAQUATTO FINISHED WITH LOWEST SCORE.
  ERICA A. HERNANDEZ 
 Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa
   The Gators fell multiple times but managed to stay bal-
anced against the Bruins on Saturday.
  Multiple gymnasts made errors and falls in their rou-
tines in UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion — mistakes that are now 
reﬂ  ected in UF’s fall from the No. 1 ranking in the country 
to No. 4. 
  “Of course we had mistakes here and there, and that 
was to be expected,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “Looking at it, there were so many new things that happened in out 
lineups.” 
  Part of that new look was Mackenzie Caquatto compet-
ing in all four events for the ﬁ  rst time since her freshman 
year. 
The Naperville, Ill., native ended up missing her hand 
placement on vault, much to Faehn’s surprise.  
  “That was so uncharacteristic, that was really kind of 
ﬂ  uky. She’s never ever done that and never missed that,” Faehn said. 
“After that happened, she took kind of a low landing and 
her legs really took a hit, so that affected her on ﬂ  oor.” 
  Caquatto, a ﬁ  ve-time All-American, ended the match 
with the lowest all-around score of all gymnasts at the 
meet (37.300), though no UCLA gymnast competed in all 
four events. 
Caquatto’s 9.150 on vault was also the lowest score in that event. 
Her 8.40 on ﬂ  oor was the lowest individual score from 
the entire meet. Florida has not had a gymnast record worse than Caquatto’s 8.40 on ﬂ  oor since Gabby Fuchs scored a 8.25 on April 10, 1999. 
  One Gator who has not seen action in any event this 
year is Lauren Rose, who tore her Achilles in the 2012-2013 
season. 
Faehn said Rose was improving and rehabbing in the 
fall, but the senior is still suffering from Achilles tendon-
itis. 
  “It’s just an ongoing issue,” Faehn said. “She is training, 
but we have to be just really careful with that and take it 
slow with her.”
  Rose has competed with her team nine times, including 
several exhibition outings, in her three years at UF. Faehn 
said she hopes to see Rose compete in at least vault this season. 
  With only two practices before the Gators hit the road 
to take on Auburn, Faehn has a tall task ahead of her in quickly correcting her squad’s imperfections. 
  Said Faehn: “We weren’t expecting them to come out of 
the gates blasting and being near perfect.” 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2014

  Florida’s recovery from an injury-rid-
dled 2013 season is moving slowly.
  On Monday, coach Will Muschamp an-
nounced the prognosis for several of the 
Gators’ walking wounded.
  Running back Matt Jones, who suffered 
a radial tear of his meniscus against LSU on 
Oct. 12, 2013, has not been cleared to play 
for spring football and will require another surgery to repair the cartilage. Muschamp said an earlier surgery repaired only about 60 percent of the sophomore’s meniscus.
  “It is a little more lengthy when you 
hear a meniscus you feel, ‘OK; it’s just a meniscus, you go in and reattach it and it’s ﬁ  ne,’” Muschamp said. 
“But this was torn all the way through. 
It’s a little more serious than a regular me-niscus.”
  The Gators will also be lacking at line-
backer during spring practices.  Alex Anzalone, Jeremi 
Powell and Matt Rolin will all miss the semes-ter with the injuries they 
suffered in 2013. Powell 
and Rolin both have torn 
ACLs, and Anzalone suf-fered a dislocated shoul-
der.
  In addition, offensive lineman Octavius 
Jackson, suffering from a chronic shoulder 
injury, is recovering from surgery.  However, it is not all bad news for UF.  Wide receiver Andre Debose, who 
missed all of 2013 with a torn ACL, is ex-pected to return for his sixth year at Flor-
ida during the spring. Muschamp said he 
will likely be able to participate in non-contact drills.
Of  fensive lineman Tyler Moore, who 
suffered a broken elbow in a scooter acci-dent last season, should be healthy enough to practice in the spring, Muschamp an-nounced.   Florida recovering from injuries before spring practice starts“It’s just an ongoing issue. [Rose] is training 
but we have to be just really careful with that 
and take it slow with her.”
