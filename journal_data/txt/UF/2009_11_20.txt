UF struggles to rack up big plays without Harvin
AlligatorStaff Writer to ke mostofthose gae-chang- kikoff return touchdowns inBy 
BOBBY CALLOVI That has left it up to the receivers has scored three receiving and tw
When Percy Harvin left Florida
early for the NFL, he took with him
more than a third of the offense's
big plays in conference gamtes.
The atocs have struggled this
season filling the void left by the
play-making receiver.
Harvin could attack defenses
anywhere on the field, rushing or
receiving-.
Florida coach Urban Meyer knew
entering the season that replacing
the big-play threats of Harvin and
fellow receiver Louis Murphy, who
added another eight of the Gators'
40 plays longer than 20 yards dur-
ing the conference slate, would not
be easy.
But Meyer did not imagine how
much of a struggle it was going to
be.
In Southeastern Conference
games, the number of plays lon-
ger than 20 yards are down to 31,
and out of those only nine went
for touchdowns compared to 17 in
2008 -a decrease of 14 percentage
points, from 43 percent last season
to 29 this season.
With opposing defenses realiz-
ing the big plays were likely to come
from the three dynamic backs for
the Gators, teams have schemed totake away the outside runs that al-
lowed the UF running backs to use
their speed to break off huge gains.
The Gators have had to pound
the ball up the middle, limiting the
speed threat of Jeff Demps, Chris
Rainey and Emmanuel Moody.ing plays, and they have dropped
the ball, literally.
"I was concerned about it. Any
time you lose two talented guys and
CI (tight end Cornelius Ingram) got
huas pwell, and he had some big-play potential, so you areealways
worried about that," Meyer said. "I
was expecting more hits out of ourtailbacks than we have had so far,
but we still have some big games
left and I know we are down, but we
(are) also up in some other areas."
The Percy Effect
There wasn't much Harvin didn't
do for the Gators offense in the three
years he was at Florida.
He lined up in the backfield, in
the slot and out wide, and he was
a threat to break off a big play from
wherever he was on the field.
Notonly was he a threat all over
the field, but Harvin could hurt
defenses rushing or receiving. He
racked up 10 catches and four rush-
es longer than 20 yards in confer-
ence play last season.
While the Florida coaches define
a big play as anything more than 20
yards, Harvin often extended those
plays to 30 yards or more.
Five of his 14 big plays were more
than 30 yards.
UF offensive coordinator Steve
Addazio recognized Harvin as a
major reason for why the really big
plays are down this year.
"Who was the guy that made
those big runs? The guy that will
be the Rookie of the Year in the
NFL," Addazio said of Harvin, whois
first season with the Minnesota Vi-
kings after being picked in the first
round.
He wasn't just providing the
Gators with a lot of big plays, but he
wa doingit onaa consistent aytbsis.
ger than 20 yards in every confer-
ence game in 2008 and added two
more in the BCS National Champi-onship Game, leading the Gators in
rushing with 122 yards on just nine
carries on the way to winning the
national title.
His departure not only took
away a large portion of the Gators'
big-play potential, but it changed
the focal point of the offense.
Running Backs
Without Harvin or Murphy re-turning, it wasn't hard to see who
the Gators would rely on to provide
them with big plays.
Florida was bringing back three
speedy running backs, who com-
bined for 12 of the 18 big plays not
made by the receiving duo.
Demps, Rainey and Moody had
the ability to provide Florida with
the explosive plays they would be
losing, especially Demps.
In his freshman season, Demps
totaled six runs for more than 20
yards. In fact, they were all longer
than 30 yards.
But without Harvin and Murphy
to occupy defenses, opponents have
been scheming to keep Demps and
the other two backs bottled up.
Defenses have been playing to
prevent the trio from getting to the
statistical breakdown

UF sophomore Jeff Demps and fellow running backs Chris Rainey and Emmanuel Moody have been forced to
mostly run inside this season, due to defenses forcing them up the middle.
outside, limiting the open space
where they can use their speed.
Demps said he expected defenses
to force him inside this season after
the success the Gators had last year
running outside.
"Defenses are spreading out to
the wide field more than they did
last year because we try to get the
ball on the perimeter, so they're
blitzing a linebacker to the field,"
Demps said.
That game plan has worked, al-
lowing Demps toonly rush for more
than 20 yards four times in confer-
ence play and none longer than 25
yards.
Rainey and Moody have notfared much better, with only two
runs longer than 20 yards each, and
only Moody has had one longer
than 30 yards in SEC games. Being
forced to run between the tackles,
the backs have had to fight through
tackles to break off big runs.
And if they are going to start
providing the Gators with the huge
plays that Meyer expected from
them before the season, the three
backs aregoing to have toimake
them in the middle of the field.
"The holes are there. We just got
to do a better job of breaking tackles
and get vertical," Demps said.Wide Receivers
It was not going to beeasy re-
placing Harvin and Murphy's pro-
duction in the passing game.
But Meyer still expected his cur-
rent receivers to step up more than
they have.
With the running backs being
forced to run up the middle, Meyer
said he needs the receivers to be
able to spark the offense with big
plays on the outside. They have had
their chances, but multiple drops
have plagued the receivers this sea-
son especially on deep balls.
After catching a slant and run-
ning with it for a 68-yard touch-
down on the first drive against
South Carolina, senior Riley Cooper
let two other deep passes go off his
fingertips later in the game.
"You got to make those plays,"
Addazio said. "If you go back and
systematically look through the sea-
son, you will see that they arethere
to be made."
While dropped balls are the most
glaring reason the Gators have not
come up with big plays in the pass-
ing game, they have also lacked
plays with a lot of yards after the
catch, something that has been part
of Meyer's offenses in previous
years.

ing more big plays off short passes.

a slant route against South Carolina,
the receivers have been unable to
beat a defender after the catch.
Nelson knows it is important for
the receivers to start filling Harvin's
big-play void with the postseason

ning to stop the running backs.
"It's one of those things if they
are playing the run, we need to start
beating them with the pass. We

Homecoming Queen gets DUI
0 SHE IS THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF DELTA
GAMMA SORORITY.
UF's Homecoming Queen was arrested on a charge of
driving under the influence early Thursday morning.
Kristen Gillis, 21, was pulled over at about 2 a.m. on West
University Avenue after running two red lights, according to
the arrest report.
When asked if she had been drinking, Gillis told the ar-
resting officer she had one beer about six hours earlier, the
report stated.
After failing field sobriety tests, she was arrested and tak-
en to a University Police Department holding cell, where she
consented to a breath test.
Her blood-alcohol content was determined to be almost.14. The legal driving limit is .08.
She was booked in the Alachua County Jail and released
1q4later that day.
Gillis declined comment when reached
by phone.
In addition to Homecoming Queen,
which was announced at Gator Growl last
month, Gillis is the Panhellenic Woman
of the Year and former president of Delta
Gamma sorority.
She has also held positions in Florida
Blue Key, the Florida Cicerones, Dance Marathon and the
First and Fifteen flag football philanthropy, according to a
profile on UF's Web site.

County officials warn residents to beware of magazine salespeople
Alachua County police would like resi-
dents of Gainesville to be on the lookout for
seasonal scams after responding to a suspi-
cious disturbance call Tuesday.
Police responded to a call at the Days
Inn at 7516 W Newberry Road and found a
17-year-old girl trying to sell magazines door
to door, Alachua Sheriff's Office spokesman
Art Forgey said.
They found that the girl belonged to a
group of about 50 out-of-towners working
the Gainesville area, several of whom hadextensive criminal histories, he said.
Although there is no evidence that this
group is acting illegally, police ask residents
to be extra careful this holiday season.
Forgey said it's not unusual for criminals
from the north to come down and run similar
scams during colder months then leave be-
fore anyone realizes what happened.
"I think any time you've got people from
out of town, you need to make sure what
you're buying is legitimate," Forgey said.

Swamp stop
U IT WILL TAKE PLACE FROM 6 P.M. TO
9 P.M. AT THE SWAMP RESTAURANT
By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
The road to the Heisman is going through
Gainesville once more.
From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. today, the coveted award
given to the top college football player in the country,
will be on display on the front lawn of The Swamp
Restaurant, located at 1642 W University Ave.
The display is part of Nissan's 2009 Southeast
Heisman Trophy Tour, which has the trophy travel-
ing to different cities across the South, mostly those
with Southeastern Conference schools.
"It's exactly where it needs to be the day before
Game Day," said Kathleen Williams, the restaurant's
office manager. "There's so much life and spirit with
our fans. We want to make this experience special. "
The trophy is scheduled toAround be in Gainesville until Satur-Gainesville day when it will then travel to
Jacksonville for the Jaguars-Bills
game. The tour will conclude with a weeklong trip
to Atlanta, the site of the SEC title game.
Fans will be allowed to look at, touch and take
pictures with the trophy. Those in attendance will
also be allowed to enter their names into a drawing
for a trip to the Heisman ceremony in New York
City this December.
Michael Taphom, the restaurant's general man-
ager, had been trying for the past few months to get
the trophy. When he found out on Wednesday that
it would be on display at his restaurant, he was ec-
static.
"Sure you can go down to the stadium and see it,
but how many times do you get a chance to actually
touch it?" he said.
According to Taphom, an average Friday eve-
ning at Swamp sees about 500 customers come and
go. He hopes the display will bring in double that
amount.
In honor of the occasion, the restaurant will be of-
fering a special "Heisman drink," which will consist
of Jack Daniel's, cranberry juice and Triple Sec.
For Justin Morris, a criminology junior and a die-
hard Gators football fan, seeing the trophy is more
than enough to make the stroll down University Av-
enue.
"Oh yeah, I'm definitely excited," he said. "Hope-
fully Tim will win a second one and solidify himself
as the greatest college football player of all time."ele

Students react to distribution of altered Darwin book
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
There are still remnants of
paper stuffed in Corey Davila's
trash can from Wednesday morn-
ing.
After reading creationist au-
thor Ray Comfort's introduction
tacked onto the thousands of
copies of Charles Darwin's "On
the Origin of Species" distrib-
uted near Turlington Plaza, he
described his reaction as instinc-
tual.
"I ripped them out," the UF
women's studies freshman said
in reference to Comfort's 49-pageintroduction. "It's still a perfectly
good book, just without the intro-
duction."
The introduction criticized
evolution, describing Darwin's
theory as racist and sexist.
Charles Baer, an assistant pro-
fessor in UF's department of bi-
ology, countered the criticisms
and urged students to consider
the historical context of Darwin's
theory.
"I would say read the origins
first, then read the rebuttal," he
said. "Read it in chronological
order."

As the 150th anniversary of

this issue.

SHCC gives out about 1,400 swine flu vaccines Thursday
* ADDITIONAL VACCINES AVAILABLE
MONDAY AT THE REITZ UNION.
BY ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students waiting outside the Student
Health Care Center Thursday had more on
their minds than the upcoming Thanks-
giving break.
About 1,400 students stopped by the
center to receive the HINI vaccine be-
tween 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
They met with medical professionalsunder the check-in tent to discuss whether
to get thevaccine as an injection or as a na-
sal mist.
Kat Lindsey, marketing coordinator for
the SHCC, said the center received 1,850
doses Monday, including 500 nasal mists
with the live virus. The rest were injections
with the inactive form of the virus.
Lindsey said the injection is mainly for
high-risk patients, especially those with
chronic conditions.
She said people may think the live virus
is dangerous, but it is perfectly safe for any
healthy person younger than 25."That's why we've had the medical
staff set up to talk to folks and give them
the option," Lindsey said.
Senior Jennifer Frey got the vaccine be-
cause she has asthma and her doctor rec-
ommends she gets flu shots.
On "I decided this was the
Campus right choice, especially be-
cause I talked to people in the
medical community and they said they
definitely recommend it, and they're get-
ting it for themselves and their family,"
she said.
Senior Kaylee McCall said she got theinjection because she is traveling out of
the country after she graduates and will be
spending eight hours on a plane.
However, she said she feels the injec-
tion is only necessary for travelers or peo-
ple with health risks.
"I think you build up an immunity to it
just being around it," McCall said.
Lindsey said the center's administra-
tors will meet Friday to discuss how they
will distribute leftover doses.
She said they will be offering more vac-
cinations at the Reitz Union Monday from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

vations Inc.'s HyGreen system with
the 2009 Best of What's New award.
The award, the magazine's top hon-
or, is given to 100 recipients out of
thousands of entrants."We are thrilled by the award,"
Elena Casson, Xhale's director of
marketing, wrote in an e-mail. "It's
such an honor to be rated one of the
top new technologies by such a well-
known publication."
Developed at UF by Dr. Richard
Melker and Dr. Donn Dennis along
with a team of Xhale engineers, the
HyGreen hand sensors monitor the
cleanliness of health care workers'
hands.
After washing their hands, health
care workers, who wear small badg-es, run their hands underneath the
sensors. When they have scrubbed
their hands thor-
oughly, the badge
will give off a
green light that
tells the worker
that he or she may
proceed to work
with a patient.
Melker Another mon-
itor is set up near
a patient's bed. When the health
care worker approaches, the bed-side monitor sends out infrared and
acoustic signals to the badges. If the
monitor reads clean, it will give off
a green light. If health care work-
ers need to go back and wash their
hands more thoroughly, the moni-
tor will vibrate.
The HyGreen system helps pre-
vent the transmission of health care-
acquired infections, which according
to statistics provided by Xhale Inno-
vations Inc., account for the deaths
of nearly 270 people in the U.S. daily
and about $40 billion in health carecosts.
At this time, the system is only at
Shands, but the company is taking
orders and will be installing in April
2010. The cost will vary depending
on the size of the hospital.
Although the company is com-
pletely focused on the HyGreen at
this point, Casson said, Xhale would
like to take its technology into the
food service industry.
"Wouldn't you like to know if
your waiter or waitress has washed
their hands?" she said.

* PROCEEDS WILL GO TO TOYS FOR
TOTS FOR NEEDY CHILDREN
By RENEE MONTALTO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Augie Artiles will help play Santa Claus for
children in Alachua County this year as he and
other members of a comedy group collect toys
for children in need.
Artiles and other members of Aracka Spon-
taneous Comedy! will host their second annu-
al Toys for Tots benefit show at Brophy's Irish
Pub, 60 SW Second St. at 9 p.m. Saturday.
Every person who attends is encouraged
to bring a toy for a less-fortunate child in Ala-
chua County, Artiles said.
Aracka spokeswoman Lauren Harmon
said events like Toys for Tots are important
because each toy impacts a child.
"Coming out to events like this affect(s) the
community in ways you wouldn't imagine,"
Harmon said. "Any toy helps at least one child
have a better Christmas."
Harmon said coming out and supporting
Aracka and Tots for Toys, will help someone
you might never expect.
"You never know who you are influencing.
It might just be your next-door neighbor who
is benefiting from this," she said.Artiles said the main focus of the Toys for
Tots show is to give underprivileged chil-
dren a message of hope and encouragement
through a toy.
"There are a whole bunch of underprivi-
leged children, and we want to raise as many
toys as we can so they can have a nice Christ-
mas," Artiles said.
"You never know who you are influ-
encing."
Lauren Harmon
Aracka Spontaneoud Comedy spokes-
woman
Harmon said there are a lot of families who
cannot afford toys for their children, especially
in this economy, so to be able to provide fami-
lies with toys would help make a memorable
Christmas.
"Without Toys for Tots, millions of children
would not have the opportunity to experience
the type of Christmas that they deserve," Har-
mon said.
The show will open with three local stand-
up comedians, continue with improv from
Aracka's cast members and end with karaoke.
Toys should be new, unwrapped and age-
appropriate for children younger than 15.
"No matter what the toy is, bringing any-
thing is such a help," Artiles said.Song covered for kids
By JOHN J. BOOTHE
Alligator Contributing Writer
At the end of the third quarter, the
crowd rises, arms lock and 90,000 begin
to sway to a simple, 10-stanza song.
As the crowd draws out the last
high note of "We Are The Boys From
Old Florida," Ben Hill Griffin Stadium
resumes its regular, Richter scale-regis-
tering raucous. But for some fans, like
local artist Mark Gaignard, the tune
lingers and the less-than-a-minutelong
chorus isn't enough to mute the calling
song for all hard-core Gators fans.
So Gaignard, former front man of
the band Big Sky, is recording his own
version of the song for the charity Big
Brothers Big Sisters of Mid-Florida.
The studio-recorded song will be in
Jack Johnson spirit.
Paul Halpern, executive director of
Big Brothers Big Sisters of Mid-Florida,
said all of the funds will go directly to
helping local children.
With his YouTube version garneringmore than 4,600 views in two weeks,
Gaignard feels like it's only a matter of
time before he begins making money
for the charity.
Although the tune is prominently
featured by UF athletic teams, Gaignard
doesn't think he should owe royalties
when the song is put up for sale.
"I would love to see them try and
squash it," he said. "Do you know how
much extra publicity that would be?"
David A. Way-
Around bright, UF directorGainesville of bands, confirmed
in an e-mail that the
university owns rights to the band ver-
sion but the lyrics and tune are public
domain for anyone to use.
"You know I'm a good guy, and I've
played a lot of shows and had a lot of
fans," Gaignard said. "But I would be
very proud if I can contribute in this
way.,

Student Government, the Freshman Leadership Council, Dance Marathon,

UF, FlU spar for breasts
By BRANDON BRESLOW
Alligator Contributing Writer
Before UF and Florida Internation-
al University face off on the football
field Saturday, the schools are team-
ing up to inform fans about breast
cancer.
Students from UF's College of
Medicine will educate fans about
breast cancer prevention and aware-
ness from 9 a.m. to noon Saturday
in the FanFest area south of the
O'Connell Center.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a
UF graduate, will attend the event.
Schultz is a breast cancer survivor
and a supporter of university research
and philanthropy.
"I am thrilled to be raising aware-
ness and increasing education about
breast cancer with my alma mater,"
she said. "The phenomenal work The
Gator Nation is doing to shed light
on breast cancer has not gone unno-ticed."
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes,
said the ideal time for this event
would have been October, during
National Breast Cancer Awareness
Month, but the two schools wanted to
work together on the project.
Breast cancer is the
On second deadliest cancerCampus among women and is
expected to kill more
than 40,000 women in 2009, according
to the American Cancer Society.
The event will also feature the
Gator Mobile Health Clinic, one of
UF's newest community outreach
programs.
The clinic will offer tours of its bus,
which will hit the road in January to
provide health screenings for under-
served populations of Alachua Coun-
ty and offer information on disease
prevention, according to a mission

Acupuncture offers relief
* PATIENTS RECEIVE TREATMENT IN
G ROU P S ETTI NG.
By KRISTEN BOWE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Melissa Castillo was tired of draining her in-
surance expense account by going to UF's Stu-
dent Health Care Center for her migraines.
She needed a solution to help her not max
out her estimated $600 limit on medication.
After ruling out acupuncture because her in-
surance didn't cover it, Castillo found out about
Gainesville Community Acupuncture, which
serves patients for as little as $20 per session.
Jennifer Downey, one of the center's certi-
fied acupuncturists, said the business is grow-
ing rapidly with uninsured patients who cannot
afford to go to the doctor or purchase medica-
tion. Other patients, she said, look for a natural
alternative to medication.
Downey and her business partner, Theresa
Rizzo-Ovia, are graduates of Gainesville's Drag-
on Rises College of Oriental Medicine. Downey
said they started the clinic because they knew
people who could benefit from acupuncture but
couldn't afford it. The clinic said private acu-
puncture can cost between $50 and $150.
At Gainesville Community Acupuncture,patients fill out health assessments and meet
an acupuncturist. After a consultation about
health, diet and the ailment, the patients relax
in a room of recliners and meditative music for
about an hour.
"It's like Gator fans in the stadium
all there to cheer on the Gators."
Jennifer Downey
acupuncturist
Downey said in order to help as many peo-
ple receive acupuncture as possible, the center
holds the sessions in a quiet room with other
people there for the same cause: to get better.
"It's like Gator fans in the stadium all there
to cheer on the Gators," she said.
According to Downey, acupuncture works
with the body and helps patients deal with their
problems.
Downey said it can help with depression,
stress, anxiety, cold and flu, any type of body
pain as well and ailments.
Castillo said the medication she got from the
doctor for pain was masking the problem, and
acupuncture prevented her from going down
a long road of medication for migraine relief
and prevention. She was afraid of taking more
medication because the side effects were keep-
ing her out of work.

6, ALLIGATOR U FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2009
Last week was unusually slow for the Department of
Darts and Laurels. In light of this, we made a (desperate?)
plea for Gators to go out and make some real news. While
we doubt that the overwhelming response was due en-
tirely to the public pity party we held for ourselves last
week, we think it helped. So now, inundated with news,
we would like to present you with a be-careful-what-you-
wish-for edition of:
Darts & Laurels
Because it's all bad news (well, almost).
First up, people are actually paying attention to Stu-
dent Government! Alright, that's not the real story, but it
was a surprise to us. The controversial issue SG took up
this week was a resolution in support of student fees for
the proposed Reitz Union renovation and expansion.
We find it painfully ironic that the only way to get more
students involved in SG is for it to basically ignore stu-
dents' interests by voting on the Reitz fees without enough
discussion.
For voting on an issue that should be left to the Student
Body (Hooray for direct democracy!) and for unleashing
your legion of senators to downplay concerns about rising
fees, we have to throw a stop-trampling-on-students-Reitz
DART at SG.
But at least this week's letter writers had something
other than the Alligator to direct their anger toward.
When the Department of Darts and Laurels heard that
Jeremy Piven would be speaking at UF this month, we
were moderately amused; he can be a funny guy, some-
times. But when we found out that Piven was to be paid
$85,000 for the appearance, we were shocked. For agreeing
to pay Piven more than the salary of some staff members
lost to budget cuts, we have to throw a that-goon-from-
"Entourage"-is-making-how-much? DART at the Accent
Speakers Bureau.
At least UF was fortunate enough to get stood up. Piven
must have had one hell of a schedule conflict to turn down
$85,000.
On Wednesday, a group of people distributed thou-
sands of copies of Darwin's "The Origin of Species" on
Turlington Plaza. Hidden beneath the cover of this invit-
ing gift was something most didn't expect: an "introduc-
tion" by creationist author Ray Comfort -basically a
refutation of all that was to follow in Darwin's ground-
breaking book. For hiding your true motives with these
underhanded tactics, we are happy to throw a there's-a-
reason-people-turn-down-your-literature DART at Ray
Comfort and his cronies.
If you have to resort to tricks to get your message across
at UF, maybe it's time to look elsewhere.
Ready for the good news? Thanks to UF alum Beau
Thompson, you'll never fumble around in bedroom again!
While that's not exactly the case, putting on a condom
might be one less thing for you to foul up. That's because
Thompson has invented a condom that rolls on "with
ease," featuring two straps that peel away "like a Band-
Aid."
While a Band-Aid is the last thing we want near our
junk, anything to streamline this sometimes awkward
process is welcome. For making our lives just a little bit
easier, we're happy to give a hope-this-idea-doesn't-go-
limp LAUREL to Mr. Thompson. Because we're looking
forward to it.
That's all for this week. Go make some (good) news,
Gators! (No DUIs -yes we heard about that.)

Cuban embargo sho
t seems that there are many people out there ill-informed
about the Cuban embargo. The first false assumptionpeo-
ple make is that the U.S. initiated the embargo because
Cuba became a communist country. The truth is that the U.S.
enacted the embargo because when the Castro regime took
power in 1959, it expropriated all of the properties of the U.S.,
including that of American citizens and corporations. Castro
enriched his regime with the millions of dollars he stole from
the U.S. and has never paid the money back.
The U.S. has tried numerous times to broker a deal with
the Castro regime to lift the embargo, but he has outright re-
jected any negotiations. Former President Jimmy Carter trav-
eled to the University of Havana in 2002 and called for an
end to the embargo. He offered the Castro regime a chance
to repay the U.S. for the properties it had seized in a timely
manner in return for a lifting of the embargo, but Castro
turned down this opportunity.
Many people are also misled by those who argue that U.S.
citizens are allowed to travel to other communist states like
China. The difference, though, is that China made a settle-
ment with the U.S. in 1979 over confiscated American prop-
erty. Since Castro refuses to repay Americans, why should
the U.S. lift an embargo without compensation for its losses?
Others argue that 50 years have passed and the com-
munist regime still stands strong; thus, the embargo has not
actually caused any harm to Castro. Yet, until 1989, Cuba's
economy was maintained by the Soviet Union, which pro-
vided $4.5 billion in subsidies every year. Since then, Cuba's
economy has shrunken by more than half.
While the regime blames the U.S. for the misery of the Cu-
ban people, the truth is that it was caused by the regimes ruin-
ous economic policies. Castro's command economy severely
restricts Cuban citizens' rights to own a private enterprise,
and at the national level, productivity has fallen dramaticallyuld remain in place

Speaking Out cilities shut down. While the aver-
age citizen does not have a full plate

You may very well ask yourself, why do I care if U.S. citi-
zens and corporations lost millions of dollars decades ago?
That's not my problem; I want to go smoke a Cuban cigar in
the sunny beaches of the Caribbean island.
Just remember that as a tourist you will be enriching a
regime that beats, jails and sentences to death anyone who
expresses his or her thoughts freely. While you are drinking
your pina colada and enjoying the ocean breeze or just walk-
ing through Havana to see how life is there, you will be sup-
porting one of the worst regimes in the world through the
money you spend. And along with the corruption, you will
support the endless human rights violations that take place
in Cuba.
In March of 2003, the government imprisoned 75 dissi-
dents, including journalists, librarians, human rights activ-
ists and democracy activists. Just last week, Yoani Sanchez,
a Cuban blogger who is censored by the government, was
viciously attacked and beaten by state security agents for her
writings of the reality of Cuba and not the pretty picture that
the regime paints for the world. At least 13,000 Cuban citi-
zens have been executed since 1959, and more than 100,000
have been jailed for opposing the Castro regime, including
at least 28,000 still in prison today, according to the Heritage
Foundation.
So if after all of this you still decide that the best thing for
Americans and Cubans is to lift the embargo and support the
wishes of the Castro regime, then it is your decision.

Quidditch sweeps UF as students join magical trend
By EMILY HANSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Thirty students gathered under
the moon Wednesday, broomsticks
in hand, and brought a sport called
quidditch to UF.
Quidditch, famed by the "Harry
Potter" book series, is a mix between
dodgeball, basketball and capture
the flag.
Amy Lobasso, a UF sophomore,
saw YouTube videos of college stu-
dents playing a modified version
of the game and started a Facebook
page to see what response it would
get from UF students.
"I thought everyone would laugh
at me," she said.
But within two weeks, more than
300 students joined the group and
posted comments about their excite-
ment on the page.
In the books, the game is played
by witches and wizards flying on
broomsticks. In the nonmagical ver-
sion of the game, broomsticks are
required, but flight is not.
Students at Middlebury College
in Vermont started an intramural
quidditch league in 2005, and inter-
est gathered quickly.
The Intercollegiate Quidditch As-
sociation was founded in 2007, and a
rule book was formalized. There are
now more than 200 teams from col-
leges all over the world.
"UF is such a big school," Lobas-
so said. "It's not right for us not to
have one."
Each team has seven players,

Three offensive players called
chasers pass a volleyball dubbed
the quaffle and try to throw it into

Two beaters throw dodgeballs The last member of a team is
called bludgers at the opposing the seeker, whose job is to catch the
team's chasers to try to tag them out snitch. In the books, the snitch is asmall golden ball with wings that
flies around the playing field. In the
nonmagical game, the snitch is a
neutral player who is often dressed
in yellow and keeps a tennis ball in
a sock in its back pocket that others
try to capture.
A seeker captures the snitch by
grabbing the sock or ball out of the
snitch's pocket. The capture is worth
30 points and ends the game.
The snitch is allowed to run
around campus and do almost any-
thing to evade capture, including
climbing a tree or riding a bike.
"The snitch is the entertainment
factor," Lobasso said.
The chasers, beaters, keeper and
seeker must have a broom between
their legs and one hand on the han-
dle during the entire game. Nick
Murado, a first-year law student
at UF, knows what it takes to play
quidditch.
He has played since 2003, be-
fore Middlebury College created
its league, in tournaments at Harry
Potter conventions. He said the in-
tensity of the game is what he loves
most about it.
UF's team formed too late in the
semester to apply to Student Gov-
ernment for recognition as a formal
dub, but Lobasso said she plans to
apply in the Spring semester and
hopes to receive some funding.
Lobasso said if the team receives
funding, she would like to have full
uniforms with capes and travel to
compete with other schools.

SERU survey reveals UF students study less than peers
0 MORE THAN 22,000 STUDENTS
TOOK THE SURVEY.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewa rt@a l1igator org
Validating the Princeton Review's party
school rankings, UF students reported in a
survey conducted earlier this year that they
spend less time studying than their peers.
Forty-six percent of students said they
spent 11 or more hours hitting the books each
week, compared with 59 percent at five simi-
larly classified universities.
The party-school ranking considers timespent studying as well as drug and alcohol
use and the popularity of the Greek system.
The survey, conducted by UF, was a little
more scientific.
The Student Experience in the Research
University survey was open to most under-
graduates at UF and had to be completed in
order to remain eligible for football tickets.
As a result, UF had the highest participation
rate -69 percent, compared with 26 to 39
percent at the other schools surveyed.
More than 22,000 students participated.
According to the survey, UF students
said they spent less time in class and noted
"allow[ing] time for other activities" as "very
important" when selecting a major more of-
ten than other students.Only 48 percent of UF students said they
felt graduating in four years was important,
compared with 57 percent at other schools.
UF also ranked No.1 among the six schools
surveyed in educational value for the price.
Addressing the Faculty Senate Thursday,
UF President Bernie Machen said the Florida
Bright Futures Scholarship Program had a lot
to do with students
U F wanting to stickAdministration around, noting that
students take fewer
than 13 credit hours on average per semes-
ter.
"[It] makes me feel like there is room for
increasing the rigor of our undergraduate ex-
perience," Machen said, "if we can only fig-ure out how to get them to register for more
classes."
The Senate also discussed a proposal that
would change how faculty can be laid off.
After a proposal submitted by the UF ad-
ministration met widespread disapproval in
May, the Senate was asked to recommend its
own. The Senate's proposal made it clear that
UF should not be able to target individuals
when making layoffs.
Instead, only units, such as a department
or a program, could be targeted.
UF's desire to make the change to its lay-
off rules came after two professors were rein-
stated by an arbiter who determined that UF
violated university regulations when laying
them off.

UF SWIMMING
Men sit 4th; women 7th
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
A slow start on Thursday at the South
Carolina Gamecock Invitational may have
set Florida's men back in their quest to chal-
lenge some of the top competitors in colle-
giate swimming.
UF's team was divided for two invitation-
als: A part of the team traveled to the Georgia
Tech Invitational, and the remainder, some
of the less-proven athletes, traveled to South
Carolina. The Gators faced tough competi-
tion on the first day and were unable to get
any sort of consistency in the early events.
The meet's participants included the
College of Charleston, Duke, East Carolina,
Florida, Georgia Southern, James Madison,
North Carolina, Old Dominion and host
South Carolina.
After completing day-one preliminary
rounds earlier that afternoon, UF began day-
one finals Thursday evening with a seventh-
place finish in the 200-yard freestyle relay,
putting the team fifth (30 points) in the over-
all standings behind leader North Carolina
(84 points).
The Gators followed that performance
with redshirt freshman Csaba Gerscak fin-
ishing eighth in the 500 free.
In the team's third event of the night, UF
began to climb up the leaderboard. Three
Gators finished in the top five of the 200individual medley: Junior Bobby Walsh
took second, sophomore Brian Howell took
fourth and junior Alex Martin finished fifth.
Another redshirt freshman, Rodion
Davelaar, took sixth in the 50 free.
When it was time for the final event of
the evening, the 400 medley relay, UF had
moved up to fourth place in the overall
standings.
On the women's side, UF had an even
slower start to the invitational.
The women finished 13th in the 200 free
relay and stood at a distant seventh (8 points)
behind the leader, North
Carolina (80 points).
The evening didn't im-
prove much for UF.
In the second event
for the women, freshman
Sharla Milne took 10th in
the 500 free, and freshman
Walsh Kaitlin Taylor finished
10th in the next event, the
200 individual medley.
Senior Coral Lopez finished 16th in the
50 free.
After five events, UF's women stood in
seventh overall with 42 points, while North
Carolina had 357 points in the lead.
The teams will continue competition to-
day with day-two preliminaries at 10 a.m.
Florida coach Gregg Troy was unavail-
able for comment for this story.CB Shaw commits to UF
By MICHAEL PIPITONE
Alligator Writer
The Gators football team plucked a
highly touted prospect from the recruit-
ing hotbed that is Southern California.
Joshua Shaw, a 6-foot-1, 195-pound
cornerback from Palmdale High, verbally
committed to play for Florida on Tues-
day.
With rumors swirling on whether Joe
Haden will return for a senior season at
cornerback, Urban Meyer has not taken
any chances, making Shaw the fifth de-
fensive back in the 2010 Gators recruiting
class. Shaw, a four-star recruit according
to Rivals.com, has no problem leaving the
Los Angeles area and coming to a school
4,000 miles from home.
"[The distance] doesn't bother me at
all," Shaw said.
He was considering Ohio State, LSU
and USC, among other schools, before
verbally committing to UF.
"Always if I had an opportunity, I am
going to take it and run away with it,"
said Shaw, the 23rd-ranked player in the
country and third for his position, accord-
ing to Rivals.com.After visiting UF's campus on an of-
ficial visit for the Tennessee game and an
unofficial visit for the Vanderbilt game,
Shaw knew that Gainesville was special.
"Great education that you can get at
UF and a chance to compete right away,"
Shaw said.
He also liked the college-town feel of
Gainesville.
"I like the city," Shaw said. "The
whole town rallies around Florida foot-
ball. Coaching staff was really nice."
Jeff Williams, Shaw's
/ high school coach, thinks
( -the cornerback will do fine
playing for Meyer across
Football te country."I have known Urban
for a long time," Williams
said. "A great player's coach. Genuinely
wants to make them better people and
football players."
Shaw has a big build for a defensive
back at 195 pounds. He has played on
both sides of the ball for the Palmdale
Falcons.
Shaw ran and caught 10 touchdowns
in his junior year and excelled on defense
with 40 solo tackles, six for a loss.

OKLAHOMA WILL COVER THE -6.5

matchup between the Sooners and
Red Raiders decided the Big 12 South

I wish I could say this year's game
will be as meaningful but it's not.
Both teams already have four
losses and are just trying to fight off
mediocrity.
While Landry Jones is no Sam

it's his time to step up.
My team in the alligatorSports
Fantasy Challenge was in disarray
heading into the first round of the
playoffs with running backs Jona-
than Dwyer and Joe McKnight on
bye weeks, and Jahvid Best still out

Murray made the cut as a re-
placement, and my team's hopes of
winning the 'ship is resting on his
shoulders. He knows this and will
come through for me and the team
he actually plays on.

Parsons leading
Gators from bench
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@aligator org
For the second game in a row,
Chandler Parsons kept one of
Florida's most impressive streaks
alive.
When his team was hitting
nothing but iron against Geor-
gia Southern on Wednesday
night, he broke the ice, nailing
the team's first three with 6:12 re-
maining in the game. This came
one game after he preserved UF's
580-game streak with a 3-point
shot by hitting a last-minute shot
against Stetson in the season
opener.
"I'm a hero, I guess," Parsons
joked.
But the 6-foot-9 forward has
found success in another role for
the Gators so far this season 
-
sixth man.
Despite leading the team with
nine rebounds per game, aver-
aging the second-most points
(14.5) and playing the third-most
minutes per game (26.5), Parsons
will likely be the first player off
the bench tonight when UF hosts
Troy at 7 in the O'Connell Cen-
ter.
Parsons recorded his thirdcareer double-double against the
Eagles on Wednesday, scoring 15
points and grabbing 12 rebounds
while providing some much-
needed energy off the bench
against a scrappy opponent.
"It's just what I'm going to do
all year," Parsons said. "I'm go-
ing to come in, play hard, bring
energy and I'm going to be re-
lentless on the offensive glass."
Parsons' long, athletic frame
allows him to make plays some
of his teammates aren't able to,
but for a player who struggled
to stay consistent from game-to-
game in his first two years, UF
coach Billy Donovan said the big-
gest change has been in his head.
"It's much more mental,"
Donovan said. "The mental prep-
aration he put in in the offseason,
the way he's practiced the last
month and a half, his maturity as
a player and person, he's totally
different as a basketball player."
Part of that change has been
simply doing what his coaches
have asked of him. Donovan said
after the game Wednesday that
he had to refocus Parsons after
his freshman year and get him to
understand what his role on the

FIU gives Florida a chance to rest, fix passing game
s much as Urban Meyer tries to playup FIU, it is still just FIU.
The Panthers will be completely
overmatched when they step onto Florida
Field to face the Gators. There is no reason
for Meyer or anyone else to pretend other-
wise.
That doesn't mean the Gators can't get
anything out of the game.
First off, this is a good opportunity
for players to get healthy before the final
stretch of the season.
Any Gator who is listed as questionable
should not play. There is no reason to risk
injuring those players any further with the
Southeastern Conference Championship
Game looming.
This game can also be a chance to get
some of the younger players more game ex-
perience.Bobby Callovi
Bobby's World
bcalIlovi @all Iiga to r orgOnce the game is
out of reach, it is time
to start pulling the
starters.
Even if the starters
get an early exit from
the game, they can still
get something out of
their short time on the
field, especially the of-
fensive players.
Everybody knows the Gators can run the
ball as well as any other offense in the na-
tion.
Everybody knows Tim Tebow can still
run the ball effectively.
But it is going to be the 11th game of the
season and the Gators' passing game is still
a work in a progress.
The receivers have dropped balls, failedto turn short passes into big gains and
looked like they were on a different page
than Tebow.
Tebow just has not looked comfortable
throwing to any other receiving option
then Riley Cooper or Aaron Hernandez,
and none of the other options have done
enough in their few chances to warrant
more touches.
The Gators can't rely on just Cooper
and Hernandez to produce in the passing
game.
Tebow needs to be able to throw to other
receiveing options when those two are be-
ing blanketed by defenses or are having an
off night.
FIU can serve as a test dummy for UF's
offense.
The Gators can work on building trust

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Florida looks to build on FSU lessons
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alligator org
The UF women's basketball team was
outsized in its loss against No. 13 FSU on
Tuesday.
But that experience will come in handy
sooner rather than later.
The team plays its first road contest
of the season at Pittsburgh tonight. The
Panthers (1-0) pose a size advantage
similar to that of the Seminoles. It's the
second game the Gators (1-1) are playing
in a span of four days.
"Pitt is huge," coach Amanda But-
ler said. "They're a lot bigger than us.
They have size that we just don't have,
strength that we just don't have. But we
have things they don't have."
The Panthers routed North Florida 61-
35 and held the Ospreys to 29.8 percent
shooting and forced 27 turnovers.
Against FSU, the Gators played stingy
defense -forcing 19 Seminoles turn-
overs -and smaller lineups to gain a
quickness advantage against a larger
team.
Targeting foul-prone players also
proved to be an effective strategy, neu-
tralizing the physicality of bigger post
players by forcing them to the bench with
foul trouble.
And while strategizing may be pro-
ductive, the Gators know they'll need
more shots to fall in future games.
Sharielle Smith, the only effective
shooter beyond the three-point line (4 of
6) Tuesday for UF, racked up 18 points
and 13 rebounds, but it wasn't enough.
Following the game, players havebeen
taking shots in practice during shooting
drills as if they were being guarded, try-
ing to mimic game-speed shooting.
"Me and Steffi (Sorensen) were ter-
rible from behind the 3-point line, andI just don't think that's going to happen
again," said Jordan Jones, who finished 2
of 11 from beyond the arc. "We got our
bad shooting night out of the way."
Jones and Sorensen combined for a
bleak 4 for 21 from beyond the arc, and
the Gators only shot 33 percent from the
field and 29 percent from downtown.
"I don't believe in moral victories atall, but if there is such a thing, then (FSU)
was something we can build off of,"
Jones said.
Despite the faulty shooting, the team
only lost by four against the Seminoles.
"We're supposed to be this great
shooting team, but we weren't," Butler
said. "But we were still in position to win
the ballgame."
UF guard Jordan Jones is leading the Gators with 15 points per game. Florida
will again face a size disadvantage at Pittsburgh tonight.

keeps start
a surprise
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@aligator org
Xavier Nixon became the first Florida
freshman to start at left tackle in 18 years Sat-
urday, but his parents were just as shocked as
everyone else in attendance.
Nixon wanted it to be a surprise. It has
been a trying month for the family. Both his
parents are in the military, and his mother,
Fotini, is stationed at Fort Hood military base
in Texas, site of the Nov. 5 shooting.
His parents flew to Columbia, S.C., not
knowing how much he would play.
"I didn't tell them I was going to start,"
Nixon said. "After the game, my mom was
crying and stuff, and they were all telling me
how proud they were."
His mother has been sta-
A tioned at Fort Hood for four
or five months. He isn't sure
Football where she was at the time of
the shooting.
"She was just as shocked
as everybody else in the country was," Nixon
said," but thank God she was safe."
Besides being his first start, the South Car-
olina game held a little extra meaning because
of the military salutes at the game and its con-
nection with the Wounded Warrior project.
The Gamecocks wore special black jer-
seys with camouflage on their shoulders, and
each uniform had an ideal, such as Identity or
Honor, instead of a player's last name.
"It kinda struck me a little," Nixon said.
"I just thought about my parents, about what
they sacrificed for the country, and it just
made me feel good."

UF VOLLEYBALL
Gators face slim odds to win SEC title
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
This weekend could prove to be historic
for the Gators, just not in a way they may
want.
Kentucky can clinch the Southeastern
Conference championship with just two
more wins over an SEC opponent, two loss-
es by No. 13 Florida (20-4,14-3 SEC), or if the
Gators lose and the Wildcats win on Friday.
It would be the first time in 19 seasons that a
team other than UT has captured the title.
The Gators will have a shot to deter No.
10 Kentucky (26-2,16-1 SEC) from ending its
streak of conference dominance on Sunday
at 2 p.m. in Lexington, Ky. However, UF
must first worry about traveling to take on
Tennessee (20-7, 13-4 SEC) tonight at 7.
"Everybody is still chasing Kentucky and
that hasn't changed," coach Mary Wise said.
"It's going to be a lot harder to win the con-
ference now but our goal has not changed
as terms of playing our best volleyball at the
end of the season."
Although there is only a slim chance re-
maining, the Gators could still win the SEC
albeit with a lot of help from other teams.UF
will have to win its final three SEC match-
es while hoping the Wildcats can lose two
of theirs and LSU can slip up once for the
Gators to just grab a share of the SEC title.
On Friday, if Kentucky wins its match
against South Carolina and UT beats the
Volunteers, it would set up a scenario in
which the Wildcats could clinch the confer-
ence with a win against the Gators on Sun-
day.
But Wise believes that the pressure that
comes along with the 18-year streak should
not be placed upon the 2009 squad.
"It isn't fair to this team," Wise said.
"Some of them weren't even born when it
started."
Coming off of a loss to LSU that put them
in this position, the Gators will have to be
quick to turn it around as they face two of
the best teams in the SEC.
"Well I don't think it would be smart
to focus on that loss," junior opposite hit-ter Lauren Bledsoe said. "We just need to
put that behind us, like it is -and leave it
there."
After the Gators lost to the Tigers earlier
in the season, they were able get back on
track and grab eight-straight sweeps, which
is something they will try to repeat after los-ing to LSU for the second time in their last
match. However, the schedule will make it a
little bit tougher this time around.
"One must also take a look at the sched-
ule after that loss," Wise said. "We did not
play the likes of Tennessee and Kentucky
after that loss, so it's a little bit different."

As a junior, he is finally proving
capable of being the player Donovan
hoped for. While filling any position
from shooting guard to power for-
ward, Parsons has played on the ball
in the team's full-court press, showed a
newfound commitment to defense and
relentlessly crashed the boards.
Sophomore point guard Erving
Walker praised Parsons' versatility,
particularly on defense, and his will-
ingness to play whatever role has been
asked of him, even
if it means not start-
ing like he did in 28
Men's of UF's 36 games last
year.Basketball "Just his whole
attitude, his hustle
is good. He brings another dimension
to the team," Walker said. "Dan (Wer-
ner) is a great player, but Chandler's
more athletic. He's the guy who gets tip
dunks besides Alex (Tyus). That's what
we need."
As for the fact that he is seemingly
the only player capable of hitting a
three in the team's first two games -
his two threes account for two-thirds of
the Gators' 3-point production -Par-
sons isn't worried about that yet.
"We have a lot of great shooters,"
Parsons said. "The shots will come.
We're going to get better on offense. I
don't think we're too worried about
it."

Three-man safety rotation working as planned
Black, Wright, Hill compliment each other
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
When Florida's coaches de-
cided they were going to give
significant playing time to Major
Wright, Ahmad Black and Will
Hill before this season started,
many questioned how that plan
would be embraced by the three
safeties.
Including the safeties them-
selves.
"Actually, I thought people
were going to end up crying. Wor-
rying about this, worrying about
that," Hill said. "But all three of
us are level-headed, and we know
that we're going to play."
The honesty of the coaching
staff has been key to the players
buying in to the system.
In the preseason, defensive co-
ordinator Charlie Strong, coach
Urban Meyer and safeties coachChuck Heater said all along that
all three players earned the right
to play, and therefore would get
snaps when the time came.
But Meyer also said that about
backup quarterback John Brant-
ley, who will end up playing in
fewer games this season than
he did in 2008 even if he makes
an appearance in all four of the
Gators' remaining games.
The safety situation, however,
played out exactly how they said
it would with no one feeling like
the third wheel.
The coaches have played all
three an equal amount and have
even found a way to play them at
the same time with the expanded
use of Strong's Joker package. The
3-3-5 defense puts an extra defen-
sive back on the field and gives
Strong the opportunity to utilize
the secondary's versatility.
Against South Carolina, Hill
said he played more nickelbackthan usual, meaning he was
matched up with receivers in the
slot, where Strong used his soph-
omore defensive back to not only
cover but also rush quarterback
Stephen Garcia.
"Actually, I thought people
were going to end up cry-
ing. Worrying about this,
worrying about that. But
all three of us are level-
headed, and we know that
we're going to play."
Will Hill
UF sophomore safety
As a result, Hill came away
with 1.5 sacks, including the first
of his career.
The Gamecocks threw for 186
yards Saturday, almost 50 yards
more than the Gators' Southeast-
ern Conference-leading 139.6 pergame average.
UF has two lockdown corners
in Joe Haden and Janoris Jen-
kins, which allows Strong to play
Wright as the lone deep safety,
patrolling the field from sideline
to sideline in much the same way
Reggie Nelson was used in his
time in Gainesville. Wright, who
was thought of as just a hard hit-
ter after his first two seasons as a
Gator, has shown a big improve-
ment in his coverage and ball
skills this season, as he is tied for
the team lead with three intercep-
tions.
Black has been allowed to roam
free in the box, and as a result, the
junior has recorded 51 tackles,
good for third on the team and
first among the safeties.
Each player possesses a differ-
ent skill set that can help the team
win.
"Major will knock your lights
out. Will is a big guy. And I'm the
small guy, but I'm probably the
surest tackler," Black said.In addition to splitting time in
the secondary, the three are all
major special teams contributors.
A season ago, Hill led the
Gators in special teams' tackles,
and Black worked his way into a
starting role after making a name
for himself on coverage teams.
Now, they all remain critical
parts of a special teams unit that
Meyer calls his best ever, even af-
ter establishing themselves as ex-
ceptional every-down defensive
players.
Plenty of playing time to go
around and a mutual respect for
each other have kept the trio con-
tent with their individual roles in
the three-man rotation.
"If you had a guy who wasn't
as good of a player, in your opin-
ion, then you would probably
have a problem with that," Heat-
er said. "But all three guys know
they bring certain things to the
table, all three of them contrib-
ute and all three of them make
plays."

BOBBY, from page 21
in games between Tebow and some of the
other receivers like Deonte Thompson, Da-
vid Nelson and Omarius Hines.
All three have shown glimpses either
this season or last of being a receiving
threat for the Gators.
They have not been even close to do-ing it on a consistent basis though, mak-
ing it tough for Tebow to feel comfortable
throwing to them when it counts in big
games.
Against FIU, Tebow can give them a
chance. Throw that deep fade to them, let
them try and turn a 10-yard route into a
50-yard play, but the Gators need to de-
velop them as trustworthy options for fu-
ture games.There is no reason to rely on Cooper
and Hernandez in a cupcake game like the
one Saturday.
If Tebow still chooses to throw to those
two, then he definitely will not feel com-
fortable throwing it to the others against
FSU or Alabama.
It can only help the Gators to try to fix
some of the kinks against FIU because
even if they struggle to pull away with thedifferent game plan, they will not be in a
danger of losing the game.
It's understandable to not want to test
the receivers out during conference games,
but this is the chance to do it.
If they can't do it against FIU, the
Gators can go back to what they know
they do well.
But it can't hurt to try. After all, it is just
FIU.
PICKS, from page 21
worst performances of the year against Nebraska -- he com-
pleted 44.8 percent of his passes, had no touchdowns and
five interceptions for a mighty 63.07 passer rating. This game
is going to come down to offenses, and I'm always putting
myself in the hands of Mike Leach. -PHIL KEGLER
Now on to the picks!
Moving atop the leaderboard at 60-49 is Bobby "I'm
a big kid now" Callovi, who was so proud of himself for
not having to "make a poopy" on the way home from Co-
lumbia, S.C. Now, if we could only teach him to change
his own diaper.
Falling to second at 59-50 is Kyle "Can you wire some
money to my PayPal?" Maistri, who went on a furious
eBay shopping spree after finding an old Dante Hall
Chiefs' jersey. Other attempted jersey purchases: Steve
Kerr, Mark Price and Tim Hardaway.
The last guy above .500 at 58-51 is the Tampa Tribune's
Mike "We all need to stop walking through the metaphor-
ical sprinkler" DiFerdinando, who proved his manhood
by not conforming to societal gender roles and cower-
ing like a little girl after a nearby sprinkler unexpectedly
went off. What's next? Giving up watching football for
True Blood?
Coming in at fourthwith a 53-56 record is the GainesvilleSun's Ed "I can't hold my chicken" Aschoff, who projectile
vomited after going to all-you-can-eat wing night. We're
sure DiFer would defend your manhood here.
Rounding out the top five at 51-58 is Mike "I'm start-
ing a revolution" McCall, who is one of 27 people in this
country who care about replay in soccer. Keep fighting
the good fight, McCall.
Checking in at sixth with a 48-61 record is the Florida
Times-Union's Mike "Write it as bad as you f----- want!"
DiRocco, who offered his young correspondent Kyle
Maistri that exact piece of advice on his latest story. Some
would call him a mentor.
The lowest Alligator guy in seventh with a 47-62 record
is Phil "How am I supposed to compete with a terrier?"
Kegler, whose girlfriend seems more concerned with get-
ting a new puppy than spending time with him. It's un-
derstandable, Phil's about as cute as Uga. Too soon?
Beginning a two-way tie for eighth at 46-63 is the Or-
lando Sentinel's Jeremy "I like to set the mood" Fowler,
who took Ben Volin out for a romantic dinner the other
night. He lit some candles, played a little Kenny G and
ordered a bottle of wine.
Also sitting in eighth is the Miami Herald's Joe "Wait,
we pick 10 games?" Goodman, who managed to pick both
UConn and Notre Dame this week, while withholding his
opinion on the LSU-Ole Miss game. We wouldn't want
to go on record with LSU this week either, with the Klan
being in town and all.And continuing to sit in dead-last place but slowly
gaining at 44-65 is the Palm Beach Post's Ben "I became a
man 15 years ago today" Volin, who offered up a little bit
too much information in his latest Facebook status. Ap-
parently he made the transition from Bernice to Ben on
the same day as his 13th birthday. Seems a little early to
be making that move, but it sure explains the affinity for
anything pink and the violent mood swings.

FlU game
U IT IS UF'S SECOND-TO-
LAST HOME GAME.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
No. 1 Florida's matchup with
FIlU probably won't provide much
excitement for fans, but there's plen-
ty at stake for the players.
Lesser-used reserves have a
chance to prove they deserve more
playing time as the season draws to
a close.
The offense can gain some confi-
dence ahead of meetings with Flori-
da State and Alabama in the South-
eastern Conference Championship
Game.
And for the seniors, Saturday's
12:30 p.m. kickoff is the beginning of
the end of their time in The Swamp.
With just two home games left,
they'll be committing everything to
memory.
"I think about that every day,"
senior linebacker Ryan Stamper
said. "This is the second-to-last
game in The Swamp, and we have
four games left. It's kind of sad, but
it's exciting at the same time."
It's a longshot that the Gators' bid
for an undefeated season will suffer
against the Golden Panthers (3-7,
3-4 Sun Belt), but when dominance
is expected, anything less can affect
a team's morale.
Florida (10-0, 8-0 SEC) is favoredgives
by around 45 points by
betting sites and has hi
with weak opponents lareserves chance to prove worth
nost online
ad its way
te in recentseasons. UF has faced Western Car-
olina, Florida Atlantic and The Cita-
del before playing the Seminoles inthe last three years, outscoring them
191-39.
"We just try to focus on doing
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF linebacker Ryan Stamper is one of many players who will be taking Florida Field for the second-to-
last time Saturday when Florida hosts FIU at 12:30 p.m.everything we've done in the past
weeks," Stamper said. "We're play-
ing FIl, but believe it or not, we've
been practicing hard just like we
have for previous games like South
Carolina and Georgia."
There isn't much room for play-
ing time to be earned on defense, but
a few offensive players could state
cases for increased roles.
Receiver Omarius Hines had
seven catches against Charleston
Southern and Troy but didn't regis-
ter another statistic until last week,
when he had two receptions for 20
yards against South Carolina.
Freshman running back Mike
Gillislee is also likely to see a lot of
action. As the fourth back on the
depth chart, Gillislee has rushed for
145 yards and a score on 20 carries,
including the team's second-longest
run of the season, a49-yarder against
Georgia.
While those two try to earn more
playing time, the clock on quarter-
back Tim Tebow's UF career will be
counting down. Tebow isn't likely
to make it through the third quarter,
giving him less than two games left
in Gainesville.
"[Tebow] realizes we have two
more Gator Walks, two more times
running out of the tunnel and two
more times being able to play on this
field in front of the greatest fans in
the country," receiver David Nelson
said. "It may hit the fans hard, but
it's hitting him even harder to real-
ize these are his last two chances."
