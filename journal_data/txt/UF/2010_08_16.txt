This summer, 731 undergradu-
ate students shook hands, took pho-
tos and moved their tassels at the 
O’Connell Center.
While 966 former undergradu-
ate students received degrees, only 
731 of them actually attended the graduation ceremonies on Aug. 7, said Mary Ann Hagler, who works 
in UF’s registrar’s office.
Chris Jarrett, who graduated with 
a computer engineering degree, said 
he thinks all students should attend their graduation ceremonies be-cause it allows families to celebrate with the students. He said it was worth waiting during the ceremony. 
In total, about 8,000 programs were 
printed for the 10 a.m. 
graduate students’ cer-emony and the 2 p.m. undergraduate stu-
dents’ ceremony, Hagler said. 
Some students at the ceremony 
decorated their caps with rhine-stones, paint, images or other crafts. 
One message written in orange and 
blue said, “Thanks Mom ‘n’ Dad.” Some caps had religious messages, and others praised the Gators’ ath-letic achievements.
Some students were awarded 
golden medallions to mark their status as Golden UF Tradition Keep-ers, which means they completed 40 
recommended traditions in the UF 
Alumni Association’s F Book.
Each of the students’ tassels were colored to indicate which college 
they were graduating from.
Channing Mims, a 23-year-old 
family, youth and community sci-
ences graduate, said she was mo-tivated to finish her degree by her desire to earn her diploma and not fail.
“I had the strength of my parents behind me,” she said. “My parents 
cheered me on, telling me, ‘You can 
finish this; you’ll be one of a couple of people in your family with a col-lege degree.’”
Although Mims, an only child, 
said she is one of the few people she knows who didn’t come to UF for the sports, she said she remem-bers when the Gators won the men’s 
basketball national championship in 
2006.
“I remember being in my dorm 
room and seeing everyone storm the streets,” she said.
She lived in a dorm for her first 
two years, and while she recom-mends others live in a dorm for their first year, she said it’s a good idea to 
move to an off-campus apartment.
One of the biggest surprises at 
UF, she said, was the number of stu-
dents.
“It was a bit overwhelming see-
ing all the students there. Until you actually experience and see it, you don’t really know.”
Her advice to freshmen: “Defi-
nitely join some of the organiza-tions. I didn’t do that, but I had a lot of friends that did and they really loved that.”
Mims is staying in Gainesville 
and working at the Alachua County Humane Society, but she said she would like to eventually go to grad-uate school.
Jarrett’s favorite memories at UF 
were at the football games.
“Saturdays in the fall were the 
best time of year,” he said.
Jarrett, along with many of the 
graduates, arrived at UF in 2006, a year that UF won both the football and men’s basketball national cham-pionships. The school has changed 
since 2006, he said. 
“I think the school’s gotten more 
academic-oriented,” he said. “Back 
then, it was more of a party school.”
Twenty-three undergraduate 
students were awarded their degree with highest honors, summa cum laude, Hagler said. The require-ments for summa cum laude honors 
varies by college, but most require a 
research project and a GPA around 3.8.
Fall graduation ceremonies will 
occur Dec. 17 and 18.Summer grads reminisce about time spent at UF

College is a marathon of hard work, stress, fun and new experiences. Graduation day is the finish line.StudentLifeBy COLIN SIMMONS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Come fall, when the Gators 
play in front of more than 90,000 
screaming fans at Ben Hill Griffin 
Stadium, there will be about 200 police officers patrolling the cam-pus who won’t be too concerned with the scoreboard. 
The officers, who come from 
the University Police Depart-ment, the Gainesville Police De-partment, the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office and the Florida 
Highway Patrol, are focused on ensuring the safety of the tens 
of thousands of fans who come 
out to watch UF’s storied football team.
During any other time of the 
year, officers would not hesitate to arrest anyone on campus with an open container of alcohol, as mandated by city ordinance. 
But with the large influx of rev-
elers and the carnival-like atmo-sphere that envelopes Gainesville on game day, the city’s open-con-tainer ordinance is not UPD offi-
cers’ main concern, said Capt. Jeff 
Holcomb, spokesman for UPD. “If you’re over 21 and you’re 
drinking at your parking spot, it’s not our focus,” Holcomb said.
What UPD is concerned about 
enforcing, he said, are underage 
drinking violations and drink-
ing environments that are out of control, such as kegs or excessive amounts of liquor on campus. 
If kegs or excessive amounts 
of alcohol are found, officers will ask that the liquor be removed. If violators don’t comply, officers will give them a written arrest, 
he said.
However, this is not a city-wide policy. 
Once students cross University 
Avenue and leave campus, open 
container and underage drinking violations are strictly enforced 
by the Gainesville Police Depart-
ment, he said.
Those who are caught with an 
open container off campus risk getting a written arrest or worse, 
depending on the violator’s de-
meanor and compliance with of-ficers, Holcomb said. 
“They are very pro-arrest,” he 
said, referring to GPD officers.
It’s also important for stu-
dents on game days to remember to stow away valuables such as iPods, cell phones and other elec-tronics, he said, or they may be stolen.  
“Parents call in every year and 
ask what the top five crimes on campus are,” he said. “It’s theft, theft, theft, theft and theft.”
Students also need to be aware 
of the changes in parking and driving policies around campus to accommodate the influx of traffic, he said.
Gale Lemerand Drive, which 
runs north-south through the middle of campus, closes two hours before kickoff, and no cars are allowed to drive on Gale Le-
merand between University Av-
enue and Stadium Road until the game ends. 
Additionally, parking around 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium is on a first-come, first-served basis, and parking on the sidewalks or grass is prohibited. 
People who park on campus 
illegally risk getting their cars towed, according to the UF Ath-letic Association’s website, gator-zone.com. 
Off-campus, tenets, landlords 
and business owners can apply for a permit with the city that al-lows them to sell parking spaces 
on their property during game 
weekends, the homecoming pa-rade and Gator Growl.
According to the City of 
Gainesville website, the yard-
parking business tax is an annual 
fee that went into effect last year. 
Landlords and business own-
ers who want to sell parking spots 
on their properties are charged 
the tax, which  ranges from $26.25 to $157.50, depending on the loca-tion of the property as well as the number of parking spots owners 
intend to sell.  
Jennifer Bush, who owns Jerry 
Bush Auto Repair with her fa-
ther, Jerry, has been selling park-
ing spots on the property for the 
last 15 years.
She said she doesn’t mind 
paying the tax because it pre-vents people from trying to sell 
parking spaces on property they 
don’t own. 
On an average game day, Bush 
sells between 30 and 60 parking 
spots.  
An available bathroom in the 
front office of the auto repair 
shop, as well as a garage to safely keep cars overnight if the owners 
don’t return, are added incentives 
for people to park on the lot. It’s also a good spot to tailgate, she said.
“We get some people from the 
other team and some from here, but they get along real well,” she said. 4, ALLIGATOR, NEW STUDENT EDITION � MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010

98 TOTAL VOTES71% YES29% NOAug. 5 question: Do you dare to be different?Today’s question: Were you able to get into all of the classes you wanted?Freshman Fun
Some friendly advice 
from the Alligator r
UF is a big place, and as your unofficial welcoming 
committee, we’re going to pass along a few tips to 
help you incoming freshman get accommodated a 
little quicker than we did.
First off, tell that little voice inside your head to shut up 
so you can listen to our nickels worth of free advice. We know a lot of you are still high off getting 30 hours of Ad-
vanced Placement credit and think you’re going to make it 
out of here in 3 years, but that’s a horrible idea. Go ahead and take the whole 4 years and sign up for something fun like History of Rock and Roll. Maybe it’ll be a tough sell to your parents, but trust us when we say loading your 
schedules down with math and science classes is a one-
way ticket to dullsville.
Make sure you never carry around a map, either. Un-
less you are looking for buried treasure, there is really no 
way to pull off looking cool while carting around a hast-
ily-printed, black and white Google Maps representation of UF campus. Instead, just ask someone to point you in the right direction. It’s a great way to meet new people and drop that freshman timidity. Just make sure to avoid 
asking anyone dressed as a zombie or Pentecostal zealot 
— those idiots are just dying for attention.
Remember, never pay any of those people on Turling-
ton Plaza any attention whatsoever. It may be tempting to 
tell them how wrong and homophobic they are, but they 
are stuck in their ways and there is nothing you can ac-complish by yelling back at them, except encouragment.
Also, learn how to cook something. Anything, really. 
We know you’re probably used to having mom and dad 
do that for you, and the adjustment will take some time, 
but nothing is worse for you in the long run than getting accustomed to running over to Pita Pit or Pizza by the Slice for dinner at 1:30 in the morning. If you can fit in a trip 
to Publix every few days, you might just be able to spare 
yourself from gaining that dreaded “Freshman 15.”
Speaking of weight gain, you should probably try to 
avoid alcohol and drugs for as long as humanly possible. Not only are these substances the gateway to bad deci-
sions, but having anything of the sort in your dorm room 
is a sure-fire way to crush your dreams of getting into law or medical school after you finish undergrad. Take it from experience, you don’t want your first phone call home to 
be a tear-filled confession about getting your first strike.
Working hard and staying out of trouble seems the best 
route for success, but you have no idea where you’ll be 
four years from now, so be flexible to change. You might be unemployed in a horrible job market with no hope of 
doing what you want with your life, like everyone’s been 
predicting for our generation. Or, you might be a beam-ing med student at one of the nation’s top universities. Or, you might take a year off to relax, travel and see the world 
before figuring out your life. Anything is possible.
So make sure to have some fun. There’s no point in 
working so hard toward your future that you can’t enjoy 
the present. We’re not suggesting that you do out drink-ing the night before an exam, but we are saying to take the time to schedule in some downtime. Do all the things you 
want to do while a combination of your parents’ money 
and Bright Futures scholarship is still footing the bill.
Take advantage of time in Gainesville
Welcome to UF. You are now a student at the 
flagship academic institution of the state of Florida. With a University of Florida degree, 
you have endless career opportunities and a promising shot at some of the nation’s top graduate programs.
Prepare to settle in for four or five years.Gainesville is certainly no Las Vegas, but there are 
plenty of ways to entertain and be entertained. The peculiarities of the city are best discovered by haphaz-ard means. Spend some time walking around campus, downtown and by the prairie.
Bolen Bluff trail, just south of Payne’s Prairie, is one 
of the best nature walks the city has to offer. A 20 min-ute walk through the forest spills out onto an indescrib-ably serene plateau with an abundance of wildlife.
For the music lover, Gainesville has countless concert 
halls, music venues and live-performance bar settings. All types of bands roll through Gainesville throughout the year, and the particularly savvy music enthusiast has a wide array of entertainment to choose from.
One of my favorite features of Gainesville is its cen-
tral location in the state. Within two hours, you can be in Tampa, Orlando or Jacksonville for a weekend get-away. An hour and a half drive east will bring the oc-casional traveler to St. Augustine, the perfect night trip 
for stargazing or beach camping.
Campus life can be very rewarding, if one is ambi-
tious and bold enough to throw themselves into in-
volvement opportunities. 
For a new student, involvement can be intimidating, 
but well worth the muster of courage necessary to try something new.
There is a club or organization for just about any-thing. I believe UF hosts over 800 different clubs yearly. 
The Greek system is also a great 
way to experience thick camarade-rie and make a solid group of dedi-cated friends. 
Student political organizations, 
like the College Republicans, the College Democrats or Student 
Government’s Student Senate offer a chance to become familiarized with citizen activism, which is, in my opin-ion, an under-appreciated trait of the well-rounded in-
dividual. 
Finally, there are programs through Florida Blue Key 
and its partnerships that are wholly oriented toward as-
piring new-student leaders, information about which 
can be found in Room 365 of the Reitz Union.
Of course, as a Gator, we all get plenty of exposure to 
premiere academic sporting events. 
Game days in Gainesville are city-wide celebrations, 
and homecoming is an experience one will not easily forget. 
Also, don’t forget to come out and celebrate the 
Gator Nation with all of your classmates and friends at 
this year’s Gator Growl on Oct. 15.
With so many things to look forward to about being a 
Gator and making the most of your time in Gainesville, there really won’t be enough time to be bored or unhap-py. Find the activity niche that fits with your personal-ity, and use it to build yourself into the well-rounded 
adult that society will expect you to be upon gradua-
tion.

Welcome to the University of Florida and The Gator 
Nation!
You should know right off the bat that you are 
exceptional in a number of ways, not the least of which is your academic track record.
Consider these statistics:Nearly 28,000 people applied to UF this year.
The roughly 6,400 students who will make up this fall’s 
freshman class are expected to have an average GPA ap-
proaching 4.1 and an average SAT score of about 1900.
With numbers like those, you could have chosen any 
number of schools. I’m glad you chose UF, and I think you’ll 
be glad you did, too.
Make no mistake, UF is a big place, but don’t let that in-
timidate you. In fact, it’s an advantage because it means you 
have more choices. Think of it like the iPhone: There’s an app for that.
For starters, you’ve selected one 
of the most comprehensive universi-
ties in the country. With 100 under-
graduate degree programs, 200 graduate degree programs 
and more than 30 combined degree programs, it’s fair to say that if you want to study it, there’s a good chance we offer 
it.
If the idea of international travel appeals to you, UF has 
an extensive and growing study-abroad program with ties 
to universities in Europe, Asia and Africa and international centers in Beijing and Paris.
Looking for a place to meet people? How about one of the 
900-plus student organizations on campus? Yes, that num-ber is correct — 900 — and they run the gamut from the Underwater Hockey Club to Gators Humans vs. Zombies. (Of course they’re real; I couldn’t possibly make those up.) For you Harry Potter fans, there’s even Quidditch.
But as anyone will tell you, the benefits of a college edu-
cation go far beyond what you’ll learn in the classroom. The bonds and relationships you build now will last a lifetime, and there’s no better time to start creating them.
Graduation seems light years away to you now, but it 
will be here before you know it. (I’ve seen a few graduations so I know.) When you finally have that hard-earned degree in hand, you’ll be joining another very special group: UF alumni. Their ranks include governors and senators, athletes and astronauts, journalists and scientists – in other words, 
people who are making a real difference in the world.
After all, that’s what Gators do.
Have a fantastic year, and Go Gators!Bernie Machen is the president of UF.UF president: ‘You are exceptional in a number of ways’Guest columnTo:  The UF Freshmen and Transfer Stu-
dents
We know you have worked very hard to 
get here, and we are happy that you chose UF.   
You have probably heard how selective UF is in 
its admissions process. You are all, without a doubt, 
a highly qualified group of students. You have what it takes to be successful in your college career, and throughout a lifetime of learning. We pledge to pro-vide you with an exceptional college experience.
How can you maximize your experience at UF? 
During your time here, you will have the chance to broaden your intellectual base. Be curious about the world around you and the people in this world. Your problem-solving abilities will be sharpened, and your communication skills enhanced by work-ing with some of the nation’s best and brightest teachers. Find your passions — academically, philosophically, socially and culturally. 
Your time at UF will be 
about new experiences and 
personal growth. You can mature in a rich and 
stimulating academic environment. UF will be fun, 
but you will also be challenged to work hard here, so that you emerge from your college years better prepared to meet the world.
We live in an extremely competitive world. It is 
a world full of problems. I hope that by the time you graduate, you are committed to solving many of them.  Our job as faculty is to provide you with the tools and skills to solve those problems.  
Best wishes for great success at UF, and welcome 
to the Gator Nation!

As a college student in 
Gainesville, you’ll likely discover 
that the nightlife is the main at-
traction. 
But that shouldn’t stop you 
from hitting the town in the day-time and early evening, either. 
Gainesville’s got cultural and his-
toric landmarks worth visiting. 
The Hippodrome State Theatre 
in downtown Gainesville, com-
monly known as “The Hipp,” 
hosts both plays and movies.
The main auditorium, where 
the plays are held, seats 266 peo-ple and recently hosted two pop-
ular shows, “The Great American Trailer Park Musical” and “Shear Madness.” 
The movie theater, which seats 
80, hosts independent films that 
you won’t find at mainstream cin-
emas. It will also re-run some in-
die films after their original runs in theaters expire. 
The building was built in 1911 
and served as both a post office 
and a courthouse. In 1972, it was 
converted into a theater.  The building, which features six large Corinthian columns, also contains 
one of the oldest manual elevators 
in the state.
“It’s a really neat old build-
ing,” said Tony Farah, an employ-ee at the theater. “The architecture 
alone adds to the theatrical expe-rience. And the actors are very devoted to their roles, so it makes 
each play a completely new expe-rience from the last.” 
The Thomas Center, located at 
302 NE 6th Ave., was originally a home built for former Gainesvile mayor William Thomas in 1910. Thomas played a key role in se-curing the city as UF’s home by 
donating about 500 acres to entice 
the state to choose Gainesville for the university. 
The center was converted into a 
hotel in 1928 and in 1972, the city planned to demolish it. A resis-tance campaign saved it and the City of Gainesville purchased the property. The 100 year-old build-
ing hosts piano recitals, weddings 
and art and history exhibits. 
Although hanging at a mu-
seum may not seem like the most interesting activity, Gainesville is 
home to the state’s official nation-
al history museum and one of the largest university museums in the Southeast.
The Florida Museum of Natu-
ral History is a place that typically stands out not only because of its traveling exhibits, fossil collec-tions and skeletons, but because of the Butterfly Rainforest.
In the Butterfly Rainforest, 
you can walk around in a giant 
screened room filled with plants 
that support up to 80 species of butterflies, according to the ex-hibit’s website. 
“The butterfly museum is un-
like anything I’ve ever seen be-fore,” said Dan Deep, a Gainesville resident who will be enrolling at UF this year. “Just the amount of 
butterflies in there was enough to 
make my head spin.”
There are also live butterfly 
releases on weekends between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Additionally, the 
museum sells butterfly-attracting 
plants on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The museum features 10 plants each week, along with at least one unannounced species. Proceeds benefit the exhibit. 
The other museum to check out 
is the Harn Museum of Art, which 
contains about 7,000 works of 
art. In 2009, the museum added a 26,000-square-foot wing dedicated specifically to Asian art. The mu-seum also hosts events such as the 
Student Government-sponsored 
Museum Nights, which open the museum up from 5 p.m. until 9 p.m. and features guest lecturers 
and guided tours. 
The Phillips Center for the Per-
forming Arts is adjacent to the 
Harn in UF’s Cultural Plaza. The center has played host to a vari-
ety of acts, from a touring Chinese 
drum group, to the legendary reg-gae group the Wailers, to comedi-ans such as Jerry Seinfeld.MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010 �NEW STUDENT EDITION, ALLIGATOR, 9

GREEK LIFE
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
The Delta Tau Chi Fraternity at Faber Col-
lege is more fantasy than reality. 
The toga parties, elaborate hazing cer-
emonies and food fights do not accurately 
reflect what Greek life is really about.  
About 2,000 students will partake in re-
cruitment for one of the four Greek councils 
this year, adding to the nearly 5,000 students who make up the Greek community at UF.
Together, members of the Interfraternity 
Council, the Panhellenic Council, the Mul-ticultural Greek Council and the National Pan-Hellenic Council account for about 15 percent of the UF student body population, 
according to Jack Causseaux, associate direc-
tor of Sorority and Fraternity Affairs. 
Formal recruitment for the Panhellenic 
Council is fast approaching, and recruitment 
for the other three councils is not far behind. 
Students who are at all interested in join-
ing a Greek chapter during their time at UF 
should start looking into gathering more information and rushing a sorority or frater-nity, Causseaux said. 
“It’s an experience a lot of people take ad-
vantage of,” he said.
The cost of joining a fraternity or sorority 
varies from chapter to chapter, although po-tential new members should understand that the cost is considerable.
There are 63 Greek chapters at UF, accord-
ing to the 2010 Guide to Florida Greeks on the Sorority and Fraternity Affairs website. Thirty-nine of the chapters have houses. 
Greek chapters participate in a number 
of community events every year, includ-ing Gator Growl and Homecoming, Greek Week, Dance Marathon, the National Pan-Hellenic  Council Stepshow and the Multi-
cultural Greek Council Field Day.Together, 
the Greek councils raise hundreds of thou-sands of dollars for charity every year, ac-
cording to the Guide to the Greeks. 
The mentality that fraternities and sorori-
ties are all about boozing and partying all the 
time is a false one, Causseaux said.
“These are values-based organizations,” 
he said. “People are looking to better them-selves.” 
The UF Greek community is dedicated to scholarship, leadership, service and commu-nity, he said.
Joining a Greek chapter helps students 
become more actively involved in the cam-pus community, he said.
Fraternities and sororities are subject to 
rules and regulations just like every other 
student organization on campus, he said. 
One set of rules, for example, deals especial-ly with hazing.
The UF anti-hazing policy is comparable 
to those of other universities, he said.
Requiring pledges to “ingest vile sub-stances,” “commit sex acts” or “sacrifice or injure animals,” for instance, are not al-
lowed, according to the Dean of Students Of-
fice website.
UF policy mandates that the students in 
each Greek chapter maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.85, but some chapters have even 
higher standards for their members.
Each chapter is either required to perform 
two service projects and one philanthropy, 
or chapters can opt to accomplish four ser-
vice projects each semester.
Anyone who rushes a chapter expecting 
to party all the time is in for a rude awaken-ing, Causseaux said. 
“There’s much more expected of you than 
just coming out to party,” he said. 
A lot of people scoff at the idea of joining 
a fraternity or sorority because they get the wrong idea from the media, he said.
But they are not all about wild parties, 
one-night stands and secret initiation rites. 
“It’s fun to make fun of, but what you see 
on TV and in the movies is not accurate,” he said.
Joining a fraternity or a sorority can pro-
vide a student with a number of opportuni-
ties, he said.
A Greek chapter provides networking op-
portunities, the chance to meet new people 
outside of the residence halls, leadership experience and an atmosphere of fellowship 
that many people cherish after college.
“I believe in fraternities and sororities and 
I believe they can help students become bet-
ter students,” Causseaux said.

cies or recruitment dates, visit the Sorority and Fraternity Affairs website at greeks.ufl.edu or call 352-392-1671.Common perception of Greeks more myth than reality

After one year and $16.3 million worth of 
construction and renovation, the Southwest 
Recreation Center is scheduled to reopen on Wednesday.
The center, which has been under construc-
tion since Aug. 25, is now 40,000 square feet larger than it was. Much of the preexisting space was also renovated, according to the UF 
RecSports website.The project did not go over budget, and it 
met its planned opening date, according to Da-
vid Bowles, director of RecSports.
On Aug. 24, RecSports is hosting the 2010 
RecSports Extravaganza, which will exhibit UF’s many sports clubs, the massage therapy program, group lessons and what’s new at Southwest Rec.
The renovations added 15,000 square feet for 
cardio equipment, a .9-mile track, a new activ-
ity room to expand the group fitness program, 
a training center and a social lounge, Bowles said. 
The center also renovated the locker rooms 
and added an office complex to make it easier for students to find all the organization’s ser-vices.
The added training center will provide 
space for fitness assessment, personal training, massage therapy and athletic training, while the social lounge will have big-screen TVs and couches. Its purpose, Bowles said, is to provide 
an area for students to “kick back and relax.”
The renovations were paid for with a fund 
created by a $2.44-per-credit fee on students. 
The fund is used to maintain, renovate and ex-pand RecSports facilities, the Reitz Union, the O’Connell Center and the Student Health Care Center.
During the week, the center opens at 7 a.m. 
and stays open until 1 a.m. On Gator Nights, 
which start every Friday night and last until 
early Saturday morning, it stays open until 2 a.m., according to the RecSports website.
On the weekends, the center is open from 10 
a.m. to 10 p.m.
Southwest Recreation Center and the Stu-
dent Recreation and Fitness Center offer group classes. The schedules for the classes can be viewed online at recsports.ufl.edu.
UF also owns Lake Wauburg, a recreation-
al lake about eight and a half miles south of campus where students can check out canoes, mountain bikes, discs, kayaks and paddle boats with a Gator 1 Card. Certification is needed to check out sailboats, jet skis and wakeboards.
Smaller on-campus athletic facilities include 
the Broward Outdoor Recreation Complex, located beside Broward Hall, and the Student 
Recreation and Fitness Center, located on the 
east side of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Aside from personal training, most services offered at RecSports facilities are free to students with Gator 1 Cards. Renovated SW Rec highlights UF recreation offerings

You’re stuck on campus late at night. 
You’ve got no car and no ride home. You’re 
armed with only your Gator 1 Card and your cell phone. 
Fortunately, you’ve got some options. 
For UF students who lack transportation, or 
are too inebriated to use their own, Gainesville 
offers several ways to get around. 
RTS, Gainesville’s bus system, has three 
special routes, called Later Gator routes, that run from 8:30 p.m. until about 3 a.m. 
Later Gator began as a partnership between 
UF and RTS to help reduce the number of stu-dents drinking and driving, according to Chip 
Skinner, marketing supervisor for RTS.
“Instead of driving, they can get on the bus 
and they don’t have to worry,” he said. “They 
can get home safely. It is by far the safest mode of transportation if they are going to be going downtown.”
The rates are the same as they are during 
normal hours, meaning that rides are free for those who flash their Gator 1 cards. 
The three routes, A, B and C, run from the 
Rosa Parks Downtown Station to UF campus, southwest Gainesville and the Oaks Mall, re-spectively. 
The routes are designed to hit most major 
student apartment complexes in Gainesville. 
Route A will not run Monday or Tuesday 
nights, however. Skinner said that the number of people who used the route was too low to 
justify keeping it open on those two nights. 
If the thought of riding a public bus isn’t 
your cup of tea, there is another free service 
that is coming to Gainesville around Aug. 15. 
GOTCHA, which stands for “Green Oper-
ated Transit Carrying Humanity Around,” is the newest player in the public transportation arena. 
The GOTCHA cars, which are custom-built 
electric vehicles, will essentially serve as free taxis for people in Gainesville from 7:30 a.m. to noon., and then pick back up in the evening until 3 a.m., though GOTCHA president, Sean Flood, says the hours are subject to change de-pending on demand. In order to get a GOTCHA car, you can ei-
ther call its dispatch center or hail one down like a taxi.
The cars are paid for by advertisements, 
and the drivers work on tips. 
The six-seat cars are also outfitted with 
iPod docks and flat-screen TVs to keep its pas-
sengers entertained along the ride. 
“I hope they’ll wonder how they got 
around before we were there,” Flood said. 
Another option for students on campus is 
SNAP, the UF Police Department’s escort ser-
vice. 
SNAP stands for Student Nighttime Aux-
iliary Patrol.
If a student calls 352-392-SNAP between 
the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 3 a.m., he or she can be picked up and dropped off just about any-where they need to go on campus. 
“It’s a great alternative to walking alone at 
night,” said Officer Pablo DeJesus, the SNAP coordinator. SNAP escorts cannot take anyone to non-
university-owned property, he said. The rea-son for this is so UPD can better respond to any situations that may arise. 
Though it is a UPD service, it is almost en-
tirely student-run.
DeJesus is the only non-student employee 
of SNAP, and the project is funded in-part by Student Government.
DeJesus advised those who are too drunk 
to drive and find themselves in search of trans-portation to ride the bus, call a taxi or a desig-nated driver instead of calling SNAP. 
He said the service’s primary objective is 
not to provide transport for intoxicated stu-dents because they may disturb others in the 
van. 
The driver of the van has the choice to ei-
ther take or leave drunk passengers and could 
possibly call the police if they feel it would be necessary. 
“SNAP’s primary goal is safety first and foremost,” he said.
For those who don’t have cars but may 
need one in certain circumstances, the Zipcar program may be helpful. 
Zipcar is a third-party company that rents 
cars to students either by the hour or by the day. These rental cars also have their own 
reserved parking spaces in campus parking 
lots.
Before you can rent from Zipcar, you must 
apply for membership. Zipcar membership applicants must be at least 18 years old and have a good driving record to be approved. 
Ron Fuller, assistant director of UF’s Trans-
portation and Parking Services, said that they can be very strict about “moving violations,” 
or speeding and red-light running. 
“Not just anyone can rent,” he said. “You 
have to have a really good driving history.” 
Zipcar’s rates are $8 an hour and $66 per 
day on weekdays, and $9 an hour and $72 per 
day on weekends.
No car, no problem: alternative transportation plentiful

Textbooks. 
They’re expensive, and buy-
ing them can be a budget-busting, heartbreaking experience. But luck-ily, students in Gainesville have 
lots of options for getting the books they need for class.
The most obvious choice, and 
the most convenient for those liv-
ing near the university, is to take advantage of the on-campus UF Bookstore, located in the Reitz Union.
Off campus, there are plenty of 
other bookstores to browse through. Some of the major stores include Orange and Blue Textbooks (OBT), with two locations near campus, and the Florida Bookstore, with three locations around town — two on West University Avenue and one on Southwest 34th Street.
The major bookstores in town, 
including the UF Bookstore, recent-ly started textbook rental programs that allow students who don’t want to permanently keep their books to save money. Books aren’t usually due until the last day of exams or the day following, depending on store policy.
Matt Stevens, floor manager for 
OBT, said renting is a good option for students because, at his loca-tion, books are rented for half the price of new books.
“It works kind of like a library 
card does,” he said.
Stevens said minimal highlight-
ing and writing is allowed in texts. 
However, if a book is returned 
with too much damage, stu-
dents will be charged the 
remaining 50 percent of the 
book cost. He said rentals 
are non-deferrable, and 
not all the books they sell 
are up for rent, including 
course packets. They do 
have a wide selection, 
though, and most large-
class texts are offered.
Buybacks for the major 
stores are open year-round, al-
though students shouldn’t expect all their books to be bought or to receive even half of the original 
price.Some students choose to buy 
non-textbooks, like required litera-
ture or history books, at local stores like Book Lover’s Vegetarian Café on Northwest 13th Street. Others use national chains like Barnes and Noble.
And, of course, a growing trend 
among students is simply to forgo textbook stores and buy books online. There are plenty of on-line options, too, such as amazon.com, craigslist.com, ebay.com and gainesville4sale.com.
Ana Silva, a 21-year-old anthro-
pology major, said she buys most, 
if not all, of her textbooks online us-
ing a website called bigwords.com. She said it acts like a search engine to find customers the best deals from many different online stores.
Silva said she thinks buying 
online is definitely the most afford-able option for students.
“The advantage is definitely the 
price,” she said.
“You can find some textbooks, 
I’m not even kidding, for $5 … and the quality is pretty much the same as buying used.”
She said the only disadvantage 
is waiting for the texts to arrive, especially if you wait until the end of the drop/add period to order 
them.
Silva said she keeps some of 
her books, but the ones she doesn’t 
want she either sells to local stores or uses bigwords.com to find the highest bidder.
Silva also added that textbooks 
can also be rented online.Students have options when buying books

Freshmen often face difficulties when 
transitioning from high school to college.
According to Martin Simpson, director 
of the Reading and Writing Center at UF, 
the biggest problem is usually procrastina-tion.
It can be an “academic killer,” he said.The problem stems from the simple fact 
that college is harder than high school, he said. Students may have been able to get by with procrastinating in high school, so they don’t think they need to fix the prob-lem.
“What used to work doesn’t work any-
more,” he said. “Writing the paper the night before it’s due—maybe you got away with that in high school, but not here.”
Students need daily checklists, and they 
need to stay on top of their homework to be successful, Simpson said.
Part of the problem is the structural dif-
ference between high school and college. Most public high schools have students in school for more than six hours every day, amounting to more than 30 hours a week of instruction. In college, full-time students might have 
15 hours of lectures each week for 15 credit hours. They are expected to study 30 hours a week outside class, Simpson said.
Channing Mims, who graduated Aug. 
8 with a degree in family, youth and com-munity sciences, said she liked the added freedom that came with coming to college.
In high school, it’s like “having a teacher 
talk at you,” which is ineffective, she said. “In college, you kind of work at your own pace. You can dabble in a lot of subjects.”
Freshman, first-semester transfers and 
first-year graduate students make up about 80 percent of the people who use the Read-ing and Writing Center’s tu-
toring services, Simpson said.
“In college, you can go all semester long 
without attending class,” he said. “There isn’t going to be a truancy cop out there.”
Students might not realize they’re in 
academic trouble until after their first few exams and it might take getting a “James Bond 007-type GPA” for students to realize they’re in trouble, he said.
“If you have a really lousy first semes-
ter, it takes a few semesters to get back to where you want to be,” he said.
Note-taking is also a big challenge for 
freshmen, he said.
In high school, students can usually get 
by with weak note-taking skills. But in col-lege, it’s harder to do well without good notes.
The Reading and Writing Center’s web-
site has videos with advice for note-taking, reading speed, memory, time management and test-taking.
Students need to set up external moti-
vations, he said. Sometimes, scheduling weekly meetings to work on study skills can be enough. The Teaching Center lets students sign up for weekly tutoring ses-sions that last 50 minutes. 
“We can give you external support when 
you need it,” Simpson said. “Some people can pull it off with internal reinforcement of shame, guilt or wanting that grade.”
The most important thing is that stu-
dents need to learn from their problems as early as possible, he said.
 “It’s one of those old sayings, you only 
learn through pain. The sooner you deal with the problem, the less serious it’ll be,” he said. 
Bad high-school habits can make transition harder

In the fall, Gainesville is a hus-
tling, bustling place. 
Cars line the urbane streets of 
University Avenue. Neon lights 
shine through the night in the down-
town district.
But surrounding the university 
and semi-metropolitan areas of the 
city is some of the most beautiful natural scenery in north Florida.
One nearby place to go if you’re 
in search of nature is Devil’s Mill-hopper Geological State Park, which is home to a 120-foot deep sinkhole 
and small rain forest, according to 
the Florida State Parks website. 
Visitors can travel down into the 
sinkhole using the park’s boardwalk system. 
Going back up the plethora of 
wooden steps from the bottom is also a way to work out. 
“People that are going to climb 
mountains go train there,” said Ra-chel Ahrens, a 19-year-old student at Santa Fe College. “I wanted to die after running all the stairs.” 
One of Gainesville’s main natu-
ral attractions is Paynes Prairie Pre-serve State Park. The park spans about 21,000 acres and is a National Natural Landmark, according to the 
Florida State Parks website. 
It is home to an abundance of 
wildlife, including bald eagles,  
horses, hawks, sandhill cranes, al-ligators, snakes, bison, otters, deer and bobcats.
In the prairie, students can hike 
the La Chua Trail or do some horse-back riding down the Chacala Trail. Camping is also an option.
On the south side of Paynes Prai-
rie is Lake Wauburg, a recreational area where students can canoe and fish for bass, bream and speckled perch.
Students can bring other boats 
onto the water for water skiing, wake boarding and sailing. How-ever, gas-powered motors are not 
allowed on the lake. 
At the lake, there is also a 55-foot 
rock-climbing wall with 19 different 
routes for beginner and advanced climbers, according to the Depart-ment of Recreational Sports website. Entrance to the lake is free with a Gator 1 Card. The park is closed Mondays.
Another lake that is closer to campus has become a natural attrac-tion as well. 
Lake Alice has become a popular 
place for students to visit, as the lake and surrounding area is home to al-ligators, turtles, wading birds and bats. The lake is also surrounded by a number of nature trails.
If you’re in search of water and 
are able to travel a bit, the towns surrounding Gainesville also have 
some worthwhile places to visit. One place that has proven to be 
quite popular for students is the Ichetucknee River north of High 
Springs. 
The main attraction at the river is 
tubing. 
Depending on which entrance 
you choose to start from, you can drift along the river for three-and-a-half hours, an hour and a half or 45 minutes, according to Ichetuck-
neeriver.com. 
Wildlife is also visible while rid-
ing along the river, which remains 
a constant 72 degrees year-round. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, wood ducks and great blue herons are frequent visitors to the river’s banks.
Also in the High Springs area are 
the things the town is named for — the springs.
Most students say that Gin-
nie Springs, Poe Springs and Blue Springs as the most popular. 
At Ginnie Springs, you can snor-
kel and swim. If you’ve got the wal-let for it, scuba diving is an option. 
“The springs are a very chill 
place,” said Lindsey Buz, a student at Santa Fe College. “It’s a very re-laxing place where you can spend quality time with your friends. It’s a great place to go if you want to go camping or fishing or barbecuing.”
Camping is also permitted, and 
party people will be thrilled to know alcohol is permitted, though not 
without limitations. No glass bottles 
are allowed, and you must be given written approval from the park in order to bring a keg with you on your trip. 
The nearby Santa Fe River also 
has tubing, kayaking and canoeing.Gainesville area offers plenty of ways to enjoy nature

ON CAMPUS

When seasoned UF students 
think of parking on campus, words 
like “nightmare,” “horrendous” and “atrocious” cascade out of their 
mouths, alongside other words that 
cannot be printed here.
With nearly 50,000 students, 
17,000 faculty and staff and 24,000 parking spaces, it’s easy to see why parking is such a struggle.
In an effort to control the chaos, 
UF has set up a strictly enforced parking policy involving color-cod-
ed decals and fines. 
“We’ve got to regulate it, or it’s a 
mad house,” said Ron Fuller, assis-tant director of Parking and Trans-
portation at UF. 
Though some of the most com-
monly seen and desired parking lots require orange decals, students may be disappointed to find that those 
decals are only available to faculty.
Instead, students living on cam-
pus can buy red decals, students liv-ing off campus can buy Park & Ride 
decals, students living in family housing villages can park in brown 
lots and disabled students can park 
in any lot on campus.
All of these decals cost $67 a se-
mester.
Students who want to park their 
scooters and motorcycles in des-ignated lots on campus can buy a cheaper decal for $48 a semester.
Some students without decals 
choose to park in the UF Bookstore and Visitor Welcome Center park-ing garage near the Reitz Union. 
There, the spaces are divided 
up into three categories. There are 45-minute parking spaces, 2-hour 
spaces, and all-day spaces. They cost 
$1, $3 and $5, respectively. 
The only problem with this is that there are only 271 available spaces in the garage.
Students who live off campus 
in areas that have “Neighborhood Parking Decal Required” signs are able to buy neighborhood decals 
from the city, as opposed to the uni-
versity. Sept. 11 is the deadline to buy neighborhood decals. 
“Everyone has to have a decal or 
permit to park on campus,” Fuller said. “There just isn’t any free park-
ing anymore.”
Those who break the rules and 
park without paying often end up paying more in fines than if they had 
purchased the appropriate decals in the first place. 
The fines range anywhere from 
the relatively inexpensive, like the $15 for overstaying your welcome 
at a metered space, to the colossally 
expensive $1,200-plus you would pay for being caught using a stolen 
gated-lot decal. 
UF pharmacy student Andy 
Hendrickson has his share of horror stories. 
“I’ve given UF so much of my 
money because of parking tickets,” he said. “I’ve pretty much bought an 
entire semester’s worth of classes in tickets.” 
Hendrickson said he once parked 
his car with his tires sitting on the white line. He found a $30 ticket for double parking placed on his wind-shield. 
In another incident, he was tick-
eted for backing into a space instead of parking facing forward, which cost him the same amount. 
In total, he said he has been tick-
eted at least 12 times.
In the event that you do receive 
a parking ticket, UF has a system where tickets can be paid online through your account with the uni-
versity. 
Also, if you’re feeling a bit cheat-
ed on a particular ticket, UF also has set up a system where students can 
appeal tickets online. 
“Parking is not easy on campus,” 
Fuller said. “It’s not easy for [park-ing staff]. Most of the time I just ride my bike.” 
The university has encouraged 
that students don’t bring their cars to school in an attempt to lighten the 
parking load on campus. 
Your Gator 1 Card, for instance, 
will allow you to get free rides on RTS buses around Gainesville. 
To promote the use of bikes on 
campus, UF student government pays for a free bike repair service 
station next to the Reitz Union. 
There is good news for those 
worried that they’ll never be able to get a spot on campus, though. 
All parking restrictions are gen-
erally lifted on campus at 4:30 p.m. Some lots lift parking at other times, such as the lot across from Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium, which lifts its re-
strictions at 3:30, and the lot next to Criser Hall, which opens up at 5:30. 
Before then, however, getting a 
decent parking space is migraine-inducing.
“I can guarantee you a parking 
space every single day,” Fuller said. “But you know where it is? Not 
where you want to be.”Parking induces migraines for student commuters18, ALLIGATOR, NEW STUDENT EDITION � MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010

ABCs
of Gainesville Alumni
 More than 330,000 Gators 
belong to UF’s Alumni Associa-
tion, and alumni live in every state 
and in more than 100 foreign countries. The as-sociation, created in 1906 by 14 grads, works with the Student Alumni Association, which cre-ates networking opportunities for students.  Butterfly Rainforest
 The Butterﬂ  y Rainforest, located inside the Florida Muse-
um of Natural History, showcases  hundreds of butterﬂ  ies from around the world. This screened enclosure contains tropical trees and plants with waterfalls and a walking path. 
 Caffeine 
 Need some fuel to cram? 
Besides UF’s three Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, Pascal’s, Kar-ma Cream and Yogaberry offer 
java within walking 
distance.
Dorm Life
Nothing summarizes freshman year better than living in one of 
UF’s tiny – and sometimes ancient – dormitories. How much students 
enjoy dorm life depends completely on roommate relationships.  Shar-ing a room with a total stranger while miles from home is not always enjoyable, so always be polite and respectful. It can go a long way.
 Environmentally friendly
  Gainesville is the ﬁ  rst U.S. city to have a feed-in 
tariff, and campus has more certiﬁ  cations by Lead-ership in Energy and Environmental Design than any other university. 
 Freedom of Speech
 Got something to say? Say it. UF has many open spaces for 
you to share your views with fellow Gators. Students can  set 
up tables for their organizations in the Reitz Union Colonnade, on Turlington Plaza or on the Plaza of the Americas, located in front of Library West. 
 Greeks 
 UF offers four organizations for fraternity 
and sorority affairs — The Interfraternity Council, the National Pan-Hellenic Council, the Multicul-tural Greek Council and the Panhellenic Coun-cil —as well as professional and business frats.Hillel
 About one- ﬁ  fth of the Stu-
dent Body is Jewish. The Hillel on University Avenue offers services and kosher dining at its restaurant, the Olam.  
Intramurals
UF’s Department 
of Recreational Sports organizes intramural teams year-round. Students, faculty, staff and spouses can 
compete in almost any sport imaginable. You can even get a part-time job ofﬁ  ciating sports such as ﬂ  ag football, basketball, soft-ball, soccer and volleyball.  All you need is a valid Gator 1 Card to play. 
Jaywalking
Drivers, beware. Although a crosswalk exists at Northwest 
17th Street and University Avenue, students prefer to dash over medians and through cars. Classroom Building 105, located across the street from Library West, fuels jaywalking. Who has time to wait for a light, anyway?
Krishna Lunch 
 “Karma-free meals” costs $4 
per day and are served on the Plaza of the Americas from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.  
Leases
 Once you move into your dorm or apartment, you will be bombard-
ed to renew your lease or sign somewhere else. Word to the wise: living at an expensive place far from campus that only has pool parties a few weekends a year may not always be the best bargain for your buck. 
Museums
Don’t be a fool and overlook our two museums. Visits 
to the Florida Museum of Natural History, the state’s ofﬁ  cial natural history museum, and the Harn Museum of Art, which features 7,000 pieces, are free except for special exhibits.Nightlife
It’s inevitable. 
You’ll be a night owl in college, so enjoy the nightlife. Just remember to set your alarm.
Organic 
Food Feel free to 
venture out and shop at town’s great or-ganic food stores, like Ward’s, Mother Earth Market or Sunﬂ  ower 
Health Foods. Parking
Good luck. You’re 
more likely to get a 100 on your ﬁ  rst exam than to ﬁ  nd  parking.Quarterback 
 John Brantley admits he looks 
more like “a guy”than an athlete. “Frat boy” might be a better description, but rather than hang-ing with the bros, he’ll be charged with replacing a UF legend  Registration
 The week of Aug. 23 to 27 will be your most frustrating week of 
the fall semester. During this time, you will try to create the perfect schedule by dropping and adding classes. You’ll ﬁ  nally realize there’s no such thing as a perfect schedule. Enjoy 7:25 a.m. bio lab.
Stadiums
This is where the magic happens: Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium at Florida Field, the O’Connell Center, McK-ethan Stadium, Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium, and the James G. Pressly Stadium at Percy Beard Track. Get out there and support the Orange and Blue.
 Teaching Zoo  
 Take a weekend trip over 
to the Santa Fe College Teach-ing Zoo, where SFC students get hands-on experience for animal care. The 10-acre zoo is home to 75 species.
Urban Meyer
UF’s football coach was named after a pope, 
and he’s quickly approaching that status. In ﬁ  ve

ELECTIONS
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Writer
Florida residents will be voting in 
statewide primaries Aug. 24. The gen-
eral elections are Nov. 2.
While the UF College Democrats or-
ganization does not endorse candidates for the primary elections, club presi-dent Kristin Klein said she encourages everyone to vote.
“Voting is one of the easiest direct 
forms of political action,” she said.
Klein, an economics and political sci-
ence senior, said the UF College Demo-crats will have a voter registration drive this semester.
The deadline for Floridians to reg-
ister to vote for the primary election passed on July 26, but the deadline for 
the general election is Oct. 4.
Both Klein and Carly Wilson, presi-
dent of the UF College Republicans, 
said it’s important for freshmen to reg-ister in Gainesville.
Klein added that it’s not too late for 
students to change their residence for voter registration. Students can change their residence to Gainesville up to the day they vote, she said.
On Aug. 8, Kendrick Meek, one of 
four candidates running for the Demo-cratic nomination for Florida’s U.S. Sen-ate race, visited Gainesville in an effort to raise support.
During his stop at the Alachua 
County Education As-sociation, Meek talked 
about promoting busi-
ness in Florida, uni-
versal health care, en-vironmentally friendly legislation and taking care of servicemen and women who suf-fer from post-traumat-
ic stress disorder.
He called his primary battle with Jeff 
Greene, a  businessman who moved to Florida two years ago, a “dress rehears-al” for the general election.
“There are political battles that I’ve 
read about and wished I was a part of, and I’m blessed and honored to be a part of this one,” Meek said.
In an interview, Meek said he would 
try to earmark research dollars for Flor-
ida universities because it helps bring jobs and create economic opportuni-ties.
Meek views the general election, 
which will likely be against Florida 
Gov. Charlie Crist and former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Marco Rubio, as a race against two Re-publicans, even though Crist registered as an independent.
Of the main candidates for U.S. Sen-
ate and Florida governor, two are UF alumni. 
Rubio attended Santa Fe Community 
College and graduated from UF in 1993. Gubernatorial hopeful Bill McCollum earned both his bachelor’s and law de-grees at UF.
The College Democrats’ first meet-
ing of the school year will be Sept. 2 at 
7 p.m. at Pugh Hall, Room 120, Klein 
said. The College Republicans’ first meeting will be Aug. 26 at 6 p.m. in the Reitz Union, Room 374.
The Students for the Preservation 
of Freedom, a libertarian group not as-sociated with either party, has not an-nounced the time of its first fall meet-ing, according to the group’s  secretary, 
William Tew. Candidates, student groups gear up for primaries

� STUDENTS CAN BUY MEAL 
PLANS OR PAY AS THEY EAT.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Writer
Studying can take a lot out of a 
student, and no one likes to work 
on an empty stomach. Thank-fully, there are plenty of dining 
options for all palates on campus, 
and lots of payment options, too.
On-campus eating is provided 
by Gator Dining Services, which 
oversees more than 40 locations, 
including national brands like Subway, Moe’s Southwest Grill, Pollo Tropical, Chick-fil-A and many others. 
The university’s primary eat-
ing facility is the Reitz Union, which houses 12 restaurants.
There are also two dining 
centers on campus: the Fresh Food Company at Broward Hall, and Gator Corner Dining Cen-ter, where students can enjoy a changing menu of home-style 
cooked meals and buffets.
Most dining options are closed 
over breaks, except for a few 
places at the Hub or Reitz Union. 
Otherwise, hours of operation for 
each restaurant can be found on-line at gatordining.com.
Students may choose to buy 
food conventionally, or, if they plan to eat on campus often, they 
can choose from various meal 
plans, all of which work off the magnetic strip of students’ Gator 1 Cards, according to the web-site.
Upon purchasing meal plans, 
accounts are automatically acti-vated and ready for use, accord-ing to the website.
Students living on campus 
may want to purchase an Open-Access Meal Plan through the university, which could save them some money. Under the 
plan, students can choose either 
5-day or 7-day access, and don’t need to worry about counting meals. 
Gator Dining officials sug-
gest that off-campus students purchase commuter meal plans, which offer weekly roll-over meal limits and discounted menu 
prices.
Students also have the option 
of using a Declining Balance Ac-
count, which is a pre-paid sys-
tem with no minimum balance or 
starting fees. It is valid at all on-campus restaurants. 
Vegetarians and vegans are 
in luck, too. UF’s dining services 
have been voted in the Top 10 
Best Vegetarian-Friendly Colleg-es in the U.S. by PETA.
Nina Zagvazdina, a graduate 
student in geography, said she became a vegetarian when she first came to UF about three years ago. She hasn’t had any trouble finding things to eat on campus.
“When I was a freshman I had 
a meal plan,” she said. “Every day for lunch and dinner 
there was something 
there … whether it was amazing 
or not was another thing.”
Zagvazdina said she usually 
brings her food with her, but if 
she buys food on campus, she 
usually eats at Subway or Moe’s, which both offer vegetarian menu 
options.
She also frequently eats 
Krishna lunches, which have 
been served daily since 1971 on 
the Plaza of the Americas from 
around 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. 
The vegetarian meals are 
served for a $4 donation, or voucher cards can be purchased, 
$30 for a 10-meal card and $20 for 
a 6-meal card, according to the Krishna website.
For more information about 
meal plans and on-campus eat-ery options, visit Gator Dining’s website or call their office at 352- 392-2491.MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010 � NEW STUDENT EDITION, ALLIGATOR, 23

Tips to acclimate yourself properly by not pissing off the locals
Yep, it’s that time of year again. 
Time for the peace to end. 
Time for the streets to crowd.  
Time for the influx of out-of-towners 
coming to steal our land, pillage our 
town and take our women.
OK, maybe not. But there’s still a 
buttload of you coming for fall semes-
ter.
But before you get too comfy in this 
town, remember that there were peo-ple here before you. People who can’t stand some of the things you do. You refer to us affectionately as Alachua 
County Residents or ACRs.
Growing up in Gainesville and now 
going to school here, I’ve been on both 
sides of the fence. I used to hate ev -
erything about the invading college kids. 
Hell, I wasn’t even allowed to 
drive south of Eighth Avenue on Fri-day nights because my parents were 
afraid I’d get plowed into by some 
drunk sophomore on a moped.
Now that I’m older, I see it from a 
different angle. Yes, I still think most of you are dummies, and I realize I am, too. But, at least I know how to be con-siderate of my fellow Gainesvillian.
Now, don’t get the idea that we 
don’t want you here. Some of you are all right. And let’s face it, you’re the 
ones who keep our businesses open. 
The bars would be SOL without you. 
But there are a few things you 
could do to keep me from wanting to hit every BMW with Miami-Dade tags I see cruising down University Avenue. Consider this your ACRs guide to Gainesville:
1. This isn’t Jersey, so don’t drive 
like it.
I realize that most of you come from 
some larger city and you’re used to driving like major a-holes, but there’s no reason to show me your manicured middle finger as you zoom past me for going 30 in a 30. 
It’s a small town and chances are 
you’re within three minutes of wher -
ever you’re going. I know I’m sound-ing very dad-like here, but this isn’t a race.
I should also add that you shouldn’t park your stu -
pid little Vespa knock-off that your landlord gave you in 
a car-sized 
parking spot. Not only is it a surefire way to be spotted as someone 
who’s not from here, it makes us ACRs want to get out of our trucks and kick your scooter over. So, seriously, stop 
it.
2. Explore the town. It’s a lot cool-
er than whatever you have planned 
this weekend.
You might not have noticed, but this 
place is friggin’ sexy as far as wildlife goes. So, instead of slamming down Four Locos this weekend at a frat 
party on your first weekend back, go 
out and look at the stars over Paynes Prairie, go to the springs or check out the deer over at Devil’s Millhopper. There’s tons of things to do here. And chances are, this wildlife won’t try to give you a tour of the frat house that’s sure to end in an awkward, regrettable scooter ride home the next morning.
3. Don’t call us ACRs.Only we can call each other ACRs.
4. Don’t be a nightcrawler.
I see this all the time. It’s 2 a.m., 
the clubs just let out and you’re all running around like those Nerf-gun-armed freshmen who play Humans vs. Zombies, only you’re belligerent 
drunks. It’s every weekend. Cop cars 
flare their lights, kids scream for at-tention and the sidewalks reek of beer and puke. It’s like a scene from “I Am Legend.”
This isn’t whatever club scene you 
have back home. You don’t look cool wearing your bright-colored clothes or your sunglasses at night as you stag-
ger out of Grog House still fist pump-
ing. You just look lost. So keep your Miami out of my Gainesville.
For reference, we ACRs don’t do 
that. We’re at a friend’s house, wear -ing jorts, listening to country music and drinking cheap beer, just like you think we are.
5. Befriend an ACR
You probably think none of us actu -
ally go to college, but I’m living proof 
that we do. We are a peaceful people who only want to be left alone and to be less inconvenienced by people who act like hooligans. 
But, if you come across a creature 
from here, be nice. If we think you’re cool enough, we might show you some 
neat things about the town, show you 
our favorite swimming hole on the riv -
er or hand you a glass of sweet tea.
I know I’ve been a royal jerk in this 
column, but some of you had it com-ing. So, take these things into account when you’re out and about this school year. 
You’ll probably run across us dur -
ing our favorite activity: goin’ to Gaterrr fuhtball games! And you can guaran-damn-tee we’ll be there. So if you see one of us, speak slow and act like you understand. We’ll get along just fine.
page 25Some homeless people are addicts, conformists, veterans, ex-convicts, family members, professionals, workers 
who have lost their jobs and wandering souls. They say they will never walk the roads alone, that they will 
always have one another. And they will always relate because in life anyone can have the same fate. 
Alex Orlando
ColumnistDear Readers,
 If you’re new in town or just returning from your summer re-spite, I’d like to personally wel-come you to our own version of collegiate paradise. Even though we’re a relatively small town, there are a ton of things to see and do (and drink). In this issue, you can find places to eat, get coffee or party your ass off in true Gainesville/Gator fashion. We have bars and nightspots on every corner. We have a ton of bike shops and hookah spots and restaurants too. I’m not go-ing to dwell on it, but there are also a significant number of the downtrodden and destitute in our town and it can’t hurt to at least be familiar with the issue. Also, there are a wide array of volunteering opportunites for those of you who want to give back to the community. Finally, I know you’re going to drink, but at least take advantage of the transportation options in town so you don’t get behind the wheel. That’s just stupid.

on the street
New students, meet your new neighbors — the homeless
By KAT BEIN  
avenue writer
Living in Gainesville, there’s 
something you’re going to encoun-
ter on the streets that you should be ready for.
No, I’m not talking about the 
ravenous, beer-bloated Gator fans or drunken sorority girls crying on 
the side of the road (although you’ll 
meet those, too). I’m talking about 
the overwhelming and aggressively sponging homeless population.
When I moved here in 2008, I 
was surprised by the sheer amount of them, as well as the ease with which they approach passersby. 
Although Gainesville was recently 
named one of the meanest cities by 
the National Coalition for the Home -
less, it doesn’t stop street dwellers of all kinds from making it one of 
their favorite stomping grounds.
We’ve got all kinds here: young, 
traveling crust kids who choose to be homeless; slightly demented but harmless crazies who can’t stop running; and of course, crackheads 
without pants. And they’ve all got a 
story. Maybe they just got out of the 
hospital and need money for medi-
cine, maybe their family was killed 
by ninjas and they need money 
for karate lessons, or maybe their “grandmamma always told me just 
ask for 75 cents.”
It’s easy at first to think you 
should give a little something — after 
all, do unto others. But after a while, it becomes obvious that there are 
just too many to have sympathy for them all, and sometimes you have to 
think back to those DARE days as a kid and just say no.
Of course, how you choose to dole 
out your funds is a personal choice. Many feel their money should be earned, either by having their car 
cleaned or listening to a pan han-dler play guitar. For some people, it’s enough if they’re enticed to laugh. 
Teaamont Hadez Cuningham 
goes for humor. He’s gained quite 
a reputation in town and online for his “ninjas killed my family” sign. 
He said he’s been using that line for 
the past 15 years and it definitely 
helps.
“I get enough to get weed, the 
herbal cigarettes I smoke and some 
food,” Cuningham said. “I don’t drink and luckily I don’t pay child 
support.”
Cuningham said he just came 
back to Gainesville a couple weeks 
ago, this being his fourth visit.
“It used to be a lot cooler,” he 
said. “When I first came here, drug 
dealers were everywhere and they 
didn’t mind meeting new people.”
Still, Cuningham said he loves be -
ing here and thinks Gainesville has 
a great atmosphere for people like 
him. He doesn’t think people giving handouts should care who they give 
it to or what they use it for.
“Don’t assume,” he said. “Even 
if you don’t think you’re helping, you 
are. Maybe they [spend your money on drinks] because they have a lot of things they’d like to forget.”Nury Dominguez, a 20-year-old 
Santa Fe business major, disagrees. She said she’s met Cuningham be -
fore, and she didn’t think his act was very funny. In fact, she’s over 
the homeless.
“I feel like especially they come 
to me and have conversations with me,” she said. “I just don’t have any -
thing for them. I used to be nice, but 
it got to the point that it was really annoying.”
She’s not alone.
“Most of them are oxygen 
thieves, they just sucking up some -
one else’s air,” said Eugene Primus, 
who doesn’t consider himself home -
less because he often stays with a 
friend.
Primus is often found sleeping in 
front of American Apparel, his “spe -
cial spot,” and is familiar to many club-goers who have seen the man cleaning up after their mess. 
Eugene has been in Gainesville 
for 22 years and helps set up and 
clean various clubs around down-town each night of the week. He 
cleans cars by day, because he said 
he was raised to believe you should 
work for what you get. 
“A lot of people in this town have 
no get up and go, they just want 
handouts,” he said. “I work for my s--- so people can’t say I owe them 
nothing.”
Max Tipping, the executive direc-
tor of the Alachua County Coalition 
for the Homeless and Hungry, said if you want to help, handouts are OK, 
but if you want to make a bigger do-nation, it’s better to come to him and 
his organization, and it’s needed.
He said the last count in Janu -
ary put the homeless population at 
1,292 people, 242 of those are chil-
dren under 18. 
He said many of the groups and 
organizations they work with desper -
ately need volunteers.
Anyone interested in making a 
donation or volunteering his or he time is asked to contact Tipping di-rectly, at 352-378-0460.By DANIEL ELSESSER

The crowd of 60 was once expect-
ed for a slow Tuesday or Wednesday, but since the construction on South Main Street decreased drive-by traf-fic, the Backstage Lounge and other businesses on South Main Street have been suffering. 
In the barroom adjacent to the rock 
lounge area, five people sat talking qui-
etly, including the owner of the Back -
stage Lounge, Rick Tingle.  Despite his 
imposing 6-foot-7-inch build, Tingle is as cordial and engaging as the female bartender, Marty Lewis, who happens to be Tingle’s “better half.”
Tingle said he has worked at the 
Lounge in some capacity since it was called Eddie C’s. After he bought it four 
years ago, he changed the name to 
the Backstage Lounge to give patrons a more comfortable feel, but promised the man who sold him the place that he would continue to house live music for the next 20 years.  
Tingle said that while live bands 
will occasionally draw a crowd for the Backstage Lounge, it has suffered 
along with many other businesses on 
South Main Street since construction from the 900 block on North Main Street to Depot Avenue began in Janu -
ary.
Tingle said that traffic has dropped 
off significantly after the construction work that is replacing sewer pipes 
and removing contaminated soil cre -
ated detours from University Avenue to 
South Main Street. 
Tingle said the lack of drive-by cus-
tomers has hurt the Backstage Lounge financially. 
“I’m paying rent for property that’s 
supposed to have 3,000 cars drive by it every day,” Tingle said.  “I’m getting 
about four.”  
Tingle said the day before the 
Backstage Lounge received a legal 
maximum capacity requirement, Trav -
is Meeks of the band Days of the New performed, and 650 people jammed into the Lounge to watch him.  
Lewis stood still and held her arms 
tightly to her sides to demonstrate the 
freedom of movement that each per -
son had that night.  
The next day, the Backstage 
Lounge was given a maximum capac-
ity of 300 people.  
At a meeting with city officials in 
April, Tingle proposed that to compen-sate for lost business, the city should give the Backstage Lounge up to four 
outdoor permits per month, which 
would normally cost $250 each.
Tingle said he has heard no re -
sponse from the city or the Florida De -
partment of Transportation. 
“If they were serious they could fin-
ish this in six or seven months,” Tingle said.  “It’s not like they’re not trying.  I just feel like they don’t care.”
Gina Hawkins, the spokeswoman 
for the City of Gainesville Public Works Department, said working two blocks at a time is more efficient than work -
ing on the entire area at once because doing the whole project at once would 
mean longer detours and would block 
more traffic crossing Main Street. 
“In order to manage the flow of traf-
fic to businesses on Main Street, we have found this design to be our most efficient option,” Hawkins said. Shortly after 1 a.m., Tingle and 
Lewis left the bar for their home. At home, they have a tomato garden that they made almost every meal from during an eight-month period when profits from the Lounge were lower than normal.  “I’m living week to week,” Tingle 
said. “In two weeks I might be here, but if I can’t pay the $2,300 for my electric bill, I might have to close my doors. That’s when you’ll see me out there chained to the construction equipment.”   26, ALLIGATOR, NEW STUDENT EDITION � MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010

Former NFL coach says ‘Survivor’ tougher than 3-a-days
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI — With NFL training camps in full 
swing, “Survivor” survivor Jimmy Johnson 
offered an apt comparison in describing his experience doing the CBS reality show in Ni-caragua.
He said it was tougher than three-a-days.“At least if you’re going through those 
practices, you get a good night’s sleep and you have food in your stomach,” Johnson 
said Tuesday. “We got no sleep, and there 
were days we were existing on less than 100 calories a day. It was extremely difficult.”
The former coach of the Dallas Cowboys, 
Miami Dolphins and Miami Hurricanes spent more than a month this summer with “Survi-vor” as one of 20 castaways.
 The season premiere will air Sept. 15, 
and to preserve the suspense, Johnson didn’t say how he fared.
But he laughed when asked if he was hap-
py when he was done.
“I was happy when they handed me 
that first light beer,” said Johnson, 
speaking by phone from his home in 
the Florida Keys. “People ask me did I enjoy it, and I have to hesitate. I 
can’t say that I really enjoyed it, but I’m really glad I did it. It was just a great adventure, but it was at times miserable.”
For one thing, the ex-coach known for his 
coiffure went without hairspray or a comb during Central America’s rainy season. 
It was just as well he didn’t have a mirror, 
either.
Johnson’s also catching up at the dinner 
table. He won’t say how much weight he lost on the “Survivor” diet, but with a laugh he said, “I’ve gained about half of it back.”

Fall season brings new hope for tried and true franchises
By JOSH ISOM
avenue contributing writer
 
Zombies, Spartans and 22 men getting sweaty together:  
It must be the beginning of gaming season. 
As if you needed more reasons to shirk off homework this 
semester, here are the heavy hitting games coming out in 
August and September:
“Madden NFL 2011” – Aug. 10 (PS3, Xbox 
360, Wii, PS2, PSP, iPhone)
Let’s face the facts:  This game is going to sell millions of 
copies. It’s the only NFL-licensed football game in town, and it’s being released on nearly every system available. 
The previous installment sold nearly two million copies 
in its first month, according to the NPD’s August 2009 re -
port. “Madden” brings in the money, and the series shows no signs of stopping.
This year’s installment in the annual franchise introduces 
the GameFlow playcalling mechanic. Essentially, GameFlow is an AI system that automatically handles both offensive and defensive playcalling to streamline the experience, ac-cording to IGN. Of course, the option to manually choose a 
play is still included, but for those of us without a lick of play -
calling know-how, GameFlow sounds like a great way for a 
wider audience to enjoy the game. 
“Metroid:  Other M” – Aug. 31 (Wii)
Besides jiggling breast physics – yes, you read that cor -
rectly – developer Team Ninja is well-known for their brutally difficult, side-scrolling “Ninja Gaiden” series from the NES 
era. Mixing together a well-known franchise like “Metroid” 
with the 2D experience of Team Ninja sounds intriguing, and when you throw in the first-person exploration elements of 
the “Metroid Prime” games, “Metroid: Other M” sounds like 
a recipe for instant success.
IGN did state some gripes with the game in their hands-
on article on August 5, most notably the game’s stiff con-trols and overeager auto-targeting; however, they did go on to state that “even with some weird quirks the game felt like it will be a really fun and engaging Metroid experience.” Decide for yourself when “Metroid: Other M” comes out August 31.
 
“Halo:  Reach” - Sept. 14 (Xbox 360)
The culmination of over a decade spent in the “Halo” uni-
verse, “Halo: Reach” is Bungie’s love letter to the series that made the Xbox a household name, and the loyal fans who 
supported them on the path to world domination.
“Halo: Reach” is the ultimate package deal: a cinematic, 
four-player cooperative campaign experience; fine-tuned com-
petitive multiplayer arena; an increasingly difficult survival 
mode; a full-fledged map editing toolset and a user-friendly 
screenshot and video capturing and sharing system.
In an interview between Bungie and Xbox360 Achieve -
ments in February, Bungie stated that “Halo: Reach” sup-ports up to 60 AI characters on screen – three times more 
than “Halo 3” – which equates to more epic skirmishes be -
tween the player and the invading Covenant forces. With that 
in mind, you shouldn’t expect Bungie to send off their classic series with anything less than a bang.
“Sid Meier’s Civilization V” - Sept. 21 (PC)
Strategy games are to consoles as comedies are to the 
TBS network:  they often try, they often fail and even the suc-cessful ones are only a success in that they don’t completely 
suck. Strategy games, however, are the PC’s bread and but-ter, and the turn-based “Sid Meier’s Civilization” games are 
some of the brightest gems in the genre.
“Civilization V” is all about empire building and resource 
management. Like “Madden 2011,” “Civilization V” aims to streamline the playing experience. According to Gamespy, to 
lower the hurdle of micromanagement to newcomers, click -
able notifications about resources and research appear on 
a screen that moves the camera directly to the issue, and advisers appear to suggest further guidance about empire building. “Dead Rising 2” - Sept. 28 (PS3, Xbox 360, 
PC)
Taking place five years after the events of “Dead Rising,” 
“Dead Rising 2” follows protagonist Chuck Greene as he rips through seething hordes of zombies in Fortune City, a me -
tropolis reminiscent of Las Vegas. 
According to TeamXbox, the amount of zombies onscreen 
has risen from 500 in “Dead Rising” to a ridiculous 7,000. Now, imagine driving through that mass of insatiable undead 
beings with a motorcycle equipped with a chainsaw.
One of the biggest flaws of “Dead Rising” was its archaic 
save system. The player had one save slot to use, a decision 
that stifled player experimentation. 
Equally as frustrating was how far apart the save stations 
were. 
According to Kotaku, “Dead Rising 2” will feature mul-
tiple save slots and will have more save stations to aid the player. 
And while that still falls short of an auto-save feature, it’s 
a step in the right direction.
“FIFA 11”- Sept. 28 (PS3, PC, Xbox 360, Wii, 
PS2, PSP, DS and mobile)
While real-life soccer continually gets put on the back 
burner in America, its video game counterpart gets plenty of love in the states. 
According to The Washington Times, “North America is the 
[No.] 2 market for the EA Sports FIFA game.” 
In an interview with Kotaku.com, Electronic Arts expects 
the U.S. to be No. 1 when “FIFA 11” releases after Landon 
Donovan’s game-winning goal against Algeria.
According to EA Sports’ website, “FIFA 2011” implements 
a new feature dubbed Personality+ that imbues an athlete’s 
real-life abilities and personality into their virtual avatar. The skill-set of each player is evaluated on over 57 traits and 36 
attributes. 
This is both good and bad news for soccer purists: While 
this feature might benefit those in control of Lionel Messi, 
those using Robbie Findley might find themselves getting 
consistently dispossessed. You’ve been warned.Madden, Metroid and Halo to be released soon

Atlantic and Neon Liger embody indie dance scene
By KAT BEIN
avenue writer  
Hello party people, welcome to the 
coolest hole in the wall.
Gainesville may be a small, liberal 
town swimming in a sea of conserva-
tism and religious enthusiasm, but in 
this tiny pocket of North Central Flori-da, we know how to get down and dirty 
with the best.
Thanks to the existence of UF, this 
otherwise bland town is home to a vi-
brant and colorful nightlife with a little something for everyone. 
There are plenty of hip-hop and top 
-40 clubs around and even a local line-dancing mecca. But most recently, it’s the indie-dance scene that has really 
come into its own.
Every night of the week there is 
something going on for those who just 
can’t get enough electro. 
The key is knowing where your 
crowd is headed each night.
Facebook is a great way to coordi-
nate between friends and clubs. Any night worth its salt has an event page 
that sends a guest list out weekly. 
There you can check who’s attend -
ing, what DJs or acts are playing and 
make your decision. 
Of course, if you have no idea what’s 
going on, you might want to start by checking out one of two nights: The Atlantic on Thursdays, or Neon Liger at Spannk on Saturdays.
The Atlantic and Neon Liger are 
the most talked about nights in town, the quintessential Gainesville dance scene hang outs and the best places to get started.

An abundance of music venues 
By MARISSA PRIETO
avenue writer
Gainesville is home to a very di-
verse group of students, and in that 
particular spirit it also houses a di-verse group of music venues to serve your auditory needs.
Whether you’re going to be 
dancing at one of the many clubs to your favorite DJs  
while sipping on a gin and tonic or jam-ming to indie music with PBR in hand, there’s a venue to fit your style. 
On any weekend night, you 
can stop in at 1982 to support  
a fresh-off-the-block local band or fist-
pump the night away to the sounds 
of booming house music at The Vault. Here are some local favorites:  
Tim and Terry’s Music & More
After having a few beers at your 
buddy’s house party in the student ghetto, stumble down to Tim and Terry’s Music & More, the two-story 
purple house behind Target Copy on 
University Avenue, for some live music any night of the week.
(Editors note: Try to drink respon-
sibly, and don’t drink and drive). This bar/deli/convenience store/music venue has everything a college stu -
dent could want. 
Feeling creative? Show off your mu -
sical talent at open-mic night, which usually takes up to four nights a week.
The front porch is also a great place 
to mingle and meet new faces.
Everyone is welcome and there’s 
never a cover charge. Food is served until midnight.
“It’s definitely a place that you 
don’t have to worry about what  
you wear,” Sarah Plimmer, manager of Tim & Terry’s, said. “Come as you are.”  
Common Grounds
There’s something different 
happening downtown at Common Grounds, 210 SW Second Ave., ev -ery night. If there’s no live show, they  
promise to have happy hour all night long ($1 domestics and $2 imports.)
“We’re a little bit of everything,” 
said Jason Rockhill, co-owner of Com-mon Grounds. 
Big names like Gainesville-based 
ska band Less Than Jake (coming Sept. 23 and 24) and JJ Grey & Mo-fro (coming Oct. 27) have graced the 
stage, as well as popular local bands 
like Michael Claytor and his Friends and Paxico via Mexico. 
 What seems like a quaint, one-
room venue can pack up to 400 peo-ple for a really popular band.
“We’re the kind of place 
that the ‘next big thing’  
plays at,” Rockhill said.
Monday nights are karaoke. Fri-
days from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. are cook -
outs and happy hour on The Porch, the outdoor sitting area  
of Common Grounds.
For shows, the 
venue is 18 and up with covers rang-ing from $3 to $17, with an addi-
tional $2 cover for those under 21. 
For nights with no shows, there is no  
cover and it’s 21 and up.
1982
Video games, beer and music. 
1982 doesn’t need much more of a description to bring the crowd.
Close to campus, 1982, 919 W Uni-
versity Ave., is a great place to see lo -
cal bands play, enjoy free video games and hang out with friends.
Indie, hip-hop, reggae, ska and 
punk bands draw an average crowd of 100 people four to five nights a week.
“We get a lot of brand-new bands 
because we are open to booking them,” said Jennifer Vito, man-
ager of 1982. “It’s really exciting  
to see them two years later if they’ve 
made it big.”
The bar is open to a wide variety of 
music, both local and underground.Monday nights are video-game 
night, which means $1 beer, no cover and no bands. 
Tuesday nights are stand-up com-
edy shows. Wednesday nights are in-dustry night. 
1982 is all ages every night. Cov -
er usually ranges between $5 and  
$10 but depends on the the artist.
In addition to the live music ven-
ues in town, there are also a num-ber of clubs where you can listen to the latest house or dance music.  
The Vault
The Vault, 238 W University Ave., is 
one of Gainesville’s newest and most popular nightclubs open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. 
There is the occasional live music 
performance, but every night Vault-goers get to experience the state-of-the-art lighting, sound and club envi-ronment.
Summer B-ers were able to see DJ 
Steve Aoki, mash-up artist Milkman and Boston-based rapper Sam Adams live at The Vault this July.
The club is 18 and up. Cover 
depends on the artist performing.  
The Venue
The Venue, 233 W University Ave., 
is one of Gainesville’s main nightclubs and is guaranteed to always have a line out the door. 
It’s mainly a dance club, but  it also 
has live music on certain nights.
In recent months, country-music 
star Corey Smith and rock band Mo-tion City Soundtrack have passed through to play a show at The  
Venue. Bassnectar, a DJ from Califor -
nia, will be coming Sept. 15.
Aside from these, Gainesville has 
many more to offer. 
All it takes is some looking around 
and the courage to try a new place in order to find your new favorite bar, and potentially your new favorite band, in town. Where to eat when 
you get the munchies
By ERIN RAUCH
avenue writer
The long list of local restaurants 
in Gainesville may seem daunting at 
first, but by the end of this brief tuto -
rial you’ll be well on your way to find-ing your favorite nook in the midst of 
the multitude of local eateries.
Now, I’m no food critic, but after 
visiting a handful of restaurants in 
Gainesville I can recommend a few of the tastiest and most affordable joints in town.
Mexican
Boca Fiesta’s menu boasts a va-
riety of Mexican food and the best margaritas in town. I have yet to test out the latter’s truth, but after eat-ing my weight in their nachos, tacos and guacamole (they let you mash it yourself, so be prepared to flex those extrinsic hand muscles), I have no doubt they will deliver in that area too.
Their chow isn’t limited to what’s 
listed on the standard menu. Every month they feature a unique meat. This month they have “swordfish-stick” tacos, with you guessed it, swordfish.
Not weird enough for you? In Jan-
uary they featured peppers stuffed with crispy meal worms. 
As the brave soul that I am, I tried 
it, and not only was it palatable, but it was tasty. 
For a menu and a detailed list of 
events, visit their website, bocafies-ta.com or call 352-336-8226. If my blurb of praise has already convinced you, then head downtown to the Sun Center, 232 SE 1st St. I recommend 
sitting outside, they have fresh pep-
pers and other edibles growing right on the walls.
Pizza
Step back into the ‘70s and en-
joy a deep-dish pizza in the back of an aquamarine VW Bus at Satchel’s Pizza, located at 1800 NE 23rd Ave. 
If eating in a van isn’t your style, you 
can eat outside, inside or in a tree house.
No matter where you sit, the pizza 
is plentiful and delicious with enough toppings to satisfy all of your taste buds. They also have salads and cal-zones that are rumored to turn you into a fanatic after the first bite.
Once you’ve finished a quarter of 
that pizza pie (trust me, you won’t be able to finish it in one sitting) order a cannoli or five, they are baked fresh in house. Take a walk to Lightnin’ Salvage behind the main restaurant before you leave to splurge on that bacon wallet you have been search-ing for or on any of their unique trin-
kets.
The restaurant is cash-only, but 
don’t fret if you forget to bring some 
dough, they have an ATM in house. For more information on the menu and restaurant hours visit their web-site, satchelspizza.com or call 352-335-7272.
Cuban
Flaco’s Cuban Bakery is located 
at the corner of University Avenue and Northwest Second Street. At this 
corner you will find the most exqui-
site Cuban food in town.
They have arepas, empanadas, 
Cuban sandwiches and a variety of pastries. It all comes at a good price and, frankly, the taste is undeniably awesome.
I recommend the Cuban sand -
wich, not only for the savory taste but 
for the portion size as well. They have 
a menu available online at allmenus.com or you can call 352-371-2000 for more information.
Sushi
We may be in the center of the 
state, but we’re not lacking in the raw fish department. 
Gainesville is home to a long list 
of sushi restaurants, some featur -
ing sushi bowls while   others offer a tapas-style dining experience.  
Dragonfly serves tapas-style, which means you share your meal. 
It’s an intriguing concept, but don’t 
be surprised if you find yourself duel-ing for that last piece of spicy tuna.  
Dragonfly is located at 201 SE 2nd Ave. 
For more information on 
their menu items and hours visit their website, dragonflysu -
shi.com or call 352-371-3359.  
BBQ
David’s Real Pit BBQ features a 
breakfast, lunch and dinner menu. Whether you’re craving a slab of ribs, corn on the cob or a pulled- pork sandwich, they have it all.  
Employees don People Eating Tasty Animals (PETA) shirts and serve you with the best Southern hospitality. So if you’re in the mood for some de -
licious BBQ slathered in your favorite 
house-made sauce, head down to 
5121 NW 39th Ave.
For information regarding res-
taurant hours and menus visit their website, davidsbbq.com or call 352-373-2002.
Everything in between
At The Top, you’ll find entrees 
that are both vegan and meat-eater friendly. 
Saying their menu is centered 
on variety doesn’t even cut it.  
No matter what you’re in the mood for, The Top will get you the grub you need to fuel up for a night of fun. 
Located at 30 N Main St., they 
are just a hop, skip and a jump away 
from many of the local music venues.  
Pair one of their gigantic burgers with 
some sweet potato fries and you’ll be waddling full and happy out the door at the end of your meal. For more information call 352-337-1118.  
   Craving curry? Look no further. Tasty Buddha is located at 25 NW 16th Ave. Suite C and has some of 
the best curry and rice dishes in 
town. 
You can pair their rice with 
meat ranging from chicken to shrimp and vegetarian-friendly options like tofu and tempeh.  
They also have burgers, salads and sandwiches. For more information visit their website, tastybuddha.com

Alright, so you’re kind of sick of 
Starbucks. I don’t blame you. Shelling 
out almost $4 for a urine-sample-sized coffee can put a damper on your caf-feine rush. 
Some of you might not be big fans 
of the whole corporation thing either; after all there is a Starbucks on every street corner of America blasting Mi-chael Buble to anyone within earshot. 
So what are you to do when you’re 
dying for a delicious pick me up? 
Well lucky for us, Gainesville’s got 
some sweet locally owned and oper -
ated coffee digs that won’t kill your budget. Plus they can give you the good feeling that comes with support-ing local businesses. I went to three Wi-Fi-connected coffee havens close to campus – Maude’s, Volta and Kar -
ma Cream – to see what they’ve got to offer.
Maude’s:
Maude’s Classic Cafe, 101 SE Sec-
ond Place, is ironically situated across the street from the downtown Star -
bucks. 
It has a nice covered patio outside 
and a big interior. 
Some desserts are available, fa-
mously the chocolate mousse cake, as well as breakfast and lunch. 
As far as the coffee goes, I tried 
their most popular drink: the Maude’s House Iced Coffee. It was nice and light with a pleasant hint of cinnamon and even had a little savory flavor of honey. 
The pleasant two-person team on 
shift explained that they really enjoy forming relationships with their cli-
ents. 
“Isn’t that right, Frank?” calls one 
worker to a man sitting in the corner, 
who confirms with a casual thumbs-up.
Volta :
If you’re feeling a bit more exotic or 
taking someone on a first date, try go-ing to Volta Coffee, Tea & Chocolate, 48 SW 2nd St. 
The owner, Anthony Rue, is kind of 
obsessed with coffee — seriously, ob-sessed. 
“We send our people out to seek 
out roasters with the best coffee from around the world,” Rue says with a huge spark of excitement. “We make sure we get the freshest beans pos-sible, which means a lot of our cof-fees are seasonal due to their harvest 
dates.” 
From Ethiopia to Peru, the menu 
inside is constantly updated with new 
brews from around the world.
And it’s not just the beans he’s con-
sumed with. Rue sends his baristas off to national and state wide barista com-petitions to be judges and to show ev -
eryone that Gainesville can rep some 
serious coffee skills.He insisted that I try their house 
cappuccino, which was served with a 
fantastic presentation. I’m usually not a cappuccino fan, but this cup was sur -
prisingly smooth. Before I knew it my mug was empty and Rue was smiling from ear to ear once he saw I downed the whole thing in record time.
Karma Cream:
The last stop on my coffee crusade 
was Karma Cream, 1025 W University Ave., a hot spot for vegans, organic- goods lovers and fair-trade coffee fans. In fact, they only serve fair-trade 
coffees and espressos, which means 
with every beverage you get a free side order of clean conscience. 
They’re open until 3 a.m., accom-
modating those all night study ses-sions very well.
And their coffee is awesome. As 
soon as I took my first sip of their Cubano Con Leche, I had a profound 
coffeegasm. The drink is sweet and 
extremely delicious, almost like a des-sert. 
Payal Patel, the barista on shift, 
told me what she thinks makes the store special. 
“We’re a lot more than just coffee, 
tea and snacks,” she said with a shy smile, “We really try to make a friendly 
environment.”
As I visited each coffee shop, I start-
ed to see what sets them apart from 
their corporate counterparts: passion. The owners and employees really en-joy making coffee, getting to know you and making sure your visit is perfect. Going to these cafes is a very personal experience, and it really makes you feel like you’re worth more than the next medium-sized vanilla latte.

When Tim Walton and Franc-
esca Enea first met back in 2002, 
neither could have predicted how much they would accomplish to-
gether. 
At the time, Walton was just 
an assistant coach at Oklahoma 
and Enea had not yet started her high school career.
But when Enea’s older sister, 
Christina, became a Sooner, Fran-cesca and Walton began to forge a relationship early.
Eight years and 232 UF wins 
later, the duo has taken their game to the National Pro Fast-pitch league, where Walton is coaching the Kissimme-based  USSSA Pride and Enea is playing outfield for him.
And while Enea and Wal-
ton have faced a steep learning 
curve during their inaugural two 
months, both are happy with how far they have come and are excit-ed to take things even further. 
“I really had a rude awaken-
ing the first couple games,” Enea said. “I realized I needed to make certain mental and swing adjust-ments, but at this point I think 
every game and every at-bat I’m 
getting better and definitely mak-ing progress.
“It’s an amazing league and 
I’m so happy I’m in it.”
ROUGH TRANSITION
Enea, like countless athletes 
before her, has found the transi-tion from college athletics to the professional ranks to be difficult. 
The 2010 UF graduate is hit-
ting just .182 with two home runs and six RBIs through her first 18 games, but there are many expla-nations for her unflattering statis-tics. 
Enea and Walton were late to 
join the Pride because of Florida’s deep run in the NCAA Tourna-ment. 
Although the Pride season 
began on May 31, Enea did not make her NPF debut until the 11th game of the season after playing with UF in the Women’s College World Series.
Enea ended her Gators career 
in an 0-for-24 slump and was ex-pected to return to form against some of the best pitchers in the world. But she successfully put 
her struggles behind her and de-
livered her first career hit in her third NPF at-bat.  
“I was really nervous getting 
to play for a new team, but once I got here and started hitting and throwing the ball around it was like I started something new,” Enea said. “It was a new chapter 
and Florida and college softball 
were behind me.”
Because of how the NPF op-
erates, new players and new coaches can have a difficult time making an early impression. The league only consists of four teams, leading to loaded rosters and stiff competition each game. 
“Every player in this league 
has really accomplished a lot,” Walton said. “There are no free outs, no easy pitchers, and no off days.”
Every team Enea faces has gold medalists or former All-Ameri-cans like Jennie Finch of Chicago and Monica Abbott of Tennessee. 
This drastic jump in the level 
of competition typically leads to poor hitting numbers from first-year players. Of the five rookies 
on the Pride, none are batting bet-
ter than .244. 
“Not only are the pitchers 
throwing different stuff at you but they’re smart, too,” Enea said. “They know how to set hitters up, especially rookie hitters.”
Walton and Enea are also faced 
with a brutally busy schedule, as 
the team plays 56 games in 84 
days, including 22 in the month of July.  
The hectic schedule means the Pride is limited to just one prac-tice per week, forcing Walton to implement changes on the fly. 
“If we’re struggling we only 
have one day to fix it,” Walton said. “It’s harder to get everything to gel properly and get communi-cation right at this level.”
Communication is something 
that has never been an issue for Enea, who was a vocal leader from the moment she stepped on the Florida campus and has con-tinued that trend in the pros. 
Enea has kept a level head de-
spite fighting for playing time for the first time in three years and 
has even bridged the gap between 
Walton and her teammates due to her experience in his system. 
“She’s always smiling and 
she’s just got that personality; that charisma,” outfielder and gold medalist Jessica Mendoza said. “Franny is such a humble player and she’s always looking to learn 
when she’s not playing.”
COACHING CURVE
Walton has only coached the 
team during home games to balance 
his work with the Gators, but he has 
still impressed his players with his 
ability to adjust to a different style 
of play. 
“He’s done a great job of coming 
in and using his style, but learning 
from us, too,” Mendoza said. “He 
asks us a lot of questions, respects 
us, and really treats us like profes-sional athletes.”
The entire season has been a 
learning experience for Walton, with 
the Pride having to manufacture 
runs more than the Gators did this past season, when UF hit a school 
record 109 home runs.  
Working in the NPF has also al-
lowed Walton to work with fast and 
athletic players – the type of athletes 
he hopes to bring to Florida in the 
coming years. 
“It’s been nice,” Walton said. 
“I’ve learned a lot of things from some of these players. I’ve gained so much confidence coaching this team 
because I watch the way I run a prac-
tice here and it validates the way I 
work with my teams at Florida.”40, ALLIGATOR, NEW STUDENT EDITION � MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010

VOLLEYBALL FAN DAY POLL QUESTION QUOTABLEBy TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
Emmanuel Moody admits he 
was a selfish running back when 
he first arrived in Gainesville.
Transferring from Southern 
Cal in 2007, Moody says he was too concerned with building off the stats he posted during his time with the Trojans. How many car-ries would he get? Yards? Touch-downs?
But, through two seasons at UF, 
Moody has yet to put up numbers quite as good as he did with USC, where he rushed for 459 yards and was named the Pacific-10 Confer-ence Offensive Freshman of the Year by Sporting News.
Splitting carries with three oth-
er backs and a now-legendary op-tion quarterback has left him with only 58 carries in each of the past two years. While handling such a light load, however, Moody came to a realization.
“This is my 15th year playing 
football and personal goals really are almost foolish,” he said at UF’s media day on Aug. 10. “This is a team game, you have to have team goals.”
Ironically, the redshirt senior 
may have made this realization just as his role in the UF offense is about to increase. With quarter-back John Brantley taking over for Tim Tebow, the Gators’ coaching staff has made it clear the offense will be tweaked to fit their its per-sonnel.
With Tebow gone, so too is the 
idea of the UF quarterback receiv-ing the bulk of the team’s carries. Last season, Tebow carried the ball 217 times. Running back Jeff Demps, by comparison, was sec-ond on the team with 99 carries.
While none of the running 
backs will suggest they are happy Tebow is gone, each one admitted they are excited about their ex-panded role.“Who doesn’t want that?” run-
ning backs coach Stan Drayton said. “They’re competitors. They want, in their minds, to have an effect on the football game. As a running back, with the ball in our hands, we definitely have a chance to have a major effect on the game.”And while the team loses a 
weapon in Tebow’s legs, the Gators’ rushing attack will actu-ally be more versatile this season, Drayton said. Because Brantley is more comfortable dropping back than Tebow was, UF will keep defenses off balance by switching between the spread and under-center formations.
Drayton added that losing 
Tebow will make recruiting run-ning backs easier, pointing out freshman Mack Brown, the No. 13 running back in the nation last year, according to Rivals.com. While watching the Gators, Brown said he knew the running backs’ roles would change with Brantley at quarterback.
“If you’ve got a major playmak-
er, you’ve got to have the ball in his hands,” Brown said. “But since Tebow left, some of the carries have fallen in our hands, so we’ve just got to do what we can with it, do our best with it.”
In particular, the running backs 
will need to come up big in short yardage situations, when Tebow powered his way to many of his 57 career rushing touchdowns. At 215 pounds, Moody is now the heaviest ball carrier on the team, meaning his number could get called a lot.
He doesn’t care about the stats 
that come with those carries, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t happy.
“There will be a lot more car-
ries to go around to the running backs,” he said, “and that’s why we came to Florida — to run the ball.”
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF running back Emmanuel Moody is expected to benefit from Tim Tebow’s departure. He received 58 carries last season, while Tebow racked up 217 rushing attempts.
Moody prepared to take on bigger role in UF offense
Let’s pretend your high school refused 
to release your grades to universities across the country.
They don’t want these institutions distract-
ing students from their studies. As a result, your SAT and ACT scores will be the sole rea-son you attend college.
Now, tell me why anybody would enroll 
there.
My next question is, why would a high 
school create these unfair rules?
This same thing is going on in college foot-
ball. After a recent string of allegations involv-ing players receiving improper benefits from agents, coaches have thrown around the idea of banning NFL scouts and team representa-tives from practices to avoid any trouble or distractions.
Alabama became the first school to actually 
act upon the threat.
But this shouldn’t become a trend, because 
it isn’t going to work.
I understand that Nick Saban, Urban Meyer 
and the rest of the coaching community want to distance themselves from these “scum-bags,” as Meyer refers to them, but in the end it’s going to hurt these storied programs.
When high school athletes are in the pro-
cess of choosing a college to attend, they want to go to the place that gives them the best chance at making the jump to the NFL.
Alabama’s ban could 
cause a shift in power.
Middle-of-the-road 
football programs are going to be the ones to 
reap the benefits from 
it. Instead of going to Alabama, where game days are your only shot 
at grabbing the attention of NFL scouts, top 
athletes with dreams of playing professional 
football are going to choose the schools that al-low them full exposure.The ban is pointless.An exchange of money is not going to hap-
pen at practice where coaches are all over the 
field monitoring players.
Let’s be real. The problem happens through 
texts messages and at nightclubs at 2 a.m. 
Coaches can’t monitor this, unless they want 
to take away phones too.
Instead, they need to do better than this 
half-hearted attempt to stop the problem and 
just accept the fact that it’s impossible to pre-vent. The only thing that can be done is to in-
form the players and then trust their integrity.
But I’m not naive. I’m well aware that in-
tegrity is hard to find in NCAA sports today. NCAA teams should not ban NFL representatives from practice

Before the Gators will know if 
they can replace Brandon Spikes, 
they’ll have to decide who will try to fill his shoes.
The position battle is down to 
close friends Jelani Jenkins and Jon Bostic.
“We’re not even thinking about 
that really,” Jenkins said. “Every practice, we’re rooting each other on when we make a big play and try-ing to get each other better. I think our friendship really carries onto the field.”
With a thick 6-foot-1, 238-pound 
frame, Bostic looks the part moreso 
than Jenkins, who’s listed 15 pounds 
lighter. But bulking up too much would be a disservice to one of Jen-kins’ best assets: his speed.
A standout at fullback and line-
backer in high school, Jenkins said playing in the middle is his favorite task, as he has the best chance for ac-tion and can read the quarterback.
He’s gotten work at the strong-side spot as well, part of lineback-ers coach D.J. Durkin’s plan to cross 
train his players and rotate them 
often.
“Any of those 
guys could see time anywhere,” Durkin said. “We’re going to find the best combination of 
three that we can. Jelani has a lot of great attributes about him, and I’d 
say he’s going to find a way onto the field somewhere.”
At times, Jenkins and Bostic have 
lined up side-by-side in the middle 
of a 3-4 formation, and while there has been speculation the Gators will 
use that set often this season, Dur-
kin and his players repeatedly used “three” when discussing the number of starting linebackers at UF’s media day on Aug. 10.
Beyond the friendship between 
Jenkins and Bostic, the group of linebackers has bonded over dinner-and-a-movie dates. Well, make that 
lunch-and-game film.The players received DVDs with 
their performance at spring practice, 
and they’ve made daily trips to UF’s film room to watch those clips and whatever else they could get their 
hands on, a practice often utilized 
by predecessors Spikes and Ryan Stamper.
“We were watching some stuff 
from like, I don’t even know what year — Brandon Siler was here and they were at Alabama,” Bostic said. “We just like watching film, watch-ing the game of football and learn-
ing the game every day.”

 Jeremy Brown is thankful every day he laces up his 
cleats for football practice.
  That’s because at one time, just putting his socks on 
was almost impossible.
  A back injury suffered during a weightlifting session 
kept Brown out of action for nearly two full years, causing 
him to consider quitting the sport altogether.
  But after a recovery fraught with a deluge of doctor 
visits and plenty of pain, the redshirt sophomore is bat-
tling for a starting spot at cornerback this season, and he’s hoping to reach the potential he ﬂ  ashed in his ﬁ  rst semes-
ter on campus.
  “Right now, I’m the healthiest I’ve been since I’ve been 
here,” Brown said.
  DERAILED
  Brown enrolled early for the spring semester of 2008, 
and it didn’t take long for the Orlando native to impress 
coaches.
  His performance in spring practice had him ahead of 
classmate Janoris Jenkins, who started as a freshman and is expected to be one of the nation’s top corners this sea-son. But Brown never got a chance to shine like Jenkins 
did.
  During a summer weightlifting session shortly before 
two-a-days, Brown was hoping to leave the gym with a 
new personal best in the leg press. Instead, he hobbled out with a serious injury.
  While lifting, his back came off the seat and gave out. 
He said it was the worst pain he’d ever felt, and with good reason.
  The damage: two ruptured discs, inﬂ  amed facet joints 
and nerve damage.
  The injury set off a tour of back specialists around 
Gainesville, so many that Brown couldn’t even give an 
estimate. 
To relieve some of the pain, doctors burned nerves in 
his back to kill them off — a procedure called a rhizotomy 
— but that was far from a solution.
  At times, Brown had trouble walking, sleeping, dress-
ing himself and even leaning over to wash his face.
  “I just thought, ‘I’m done,’” Brown said. “I didn’t think 
I’d be able to recover fully and just get back to myself. I felt like I was always going to have a (mental) block with my back and it was always going to be an issue.”
  ROCK BOTTOM
  As the doctor visits mounted, Brown didn’t see much 
improvement with his back. If everyday tasks were a chore, how could he hope to play football again?
  He said he thought about giving up the sport, largely 
because he wanted to be able to support his 3-year-old son, Jaden. 
  “His life is more precious than football,” Brown said. 
“Football is not who I am, it’s just what I do. At the end of the day, I have to think about my future. Am I going to be able to walk again? Am I going to be able to interact? If we couldn’t get this ﬁ  xed, you always think about just hanging it up.”
  In his darkest period, Brown turned to running back 
Emmanuel Moody, one of the team’s most devout Chris-
tians and a player with plenty of experience when it comes 
to injuries.
  Since transferring from Southern Cal, Moody has bat-
tled nagging ankle injuries, and he counseled Brown on 
his faith and how to deal with being dinged up. 
  “When it ﬁ  rst happened, he hit rock bottom,” Moody  Brown ready to shine after two-year injury absence

Wednesday could be a big day 
for a select few schools and their 
2011 recruiting classes.
And UF happens to be one of 
those select few.
Both cornerback Nick Wai-
some and athlete James Wilder Jr. are scheduled to announce their college destinations that day, and both have the Gators among their top choices.
Waisome, a four-star recruit 
out of Groveland South Lake, 
plans to orally commit Wednes-
day during a nationally televised announcement.
His decision could take place 
at the ESPN Club in Downtown Disney, but details have not been finalized. Wilder, a five-star ath-lete from Tampa Plant, plans to announce his decision the same 
day. 
Wilder’s high school coach, 
Robert Weiner, confirmed last 
Monday to Rivals.com that Wild-er, the No. 3 recruit in the nation, will make his announcement Wednesday and it is expected to happen around 5 p.m. Wilder has said he would like to make his an-
nouncement in the gymnasium at 
Plant.
Wilder is one of the most cov-
eted recruits in the nation and plays running back as well as line-backer and defensive end. 
“I’ve slept on it a lot,” Wilder 
said at an announcement for his teammates Phillip Ely and Tony 
Posada. “Today I’ll have FSU in 
the lead, tomorrow I’ll have UF and in three days I’ll have Geor-gia. ... I’ve still got a lot of think-ing to do in the last seven days.”
He was thought to be a UF lean up until recently when he didn’t 
show up at the Gators’ sixth an-
nual Friday Night Lights camp last month. Instead, he was visit-ing FSU that day and missed the camp because of it.
Waisome, the No. 7 cornerback 
recruit in the nation according to Rivals.com, impressed those in at-tendance at Friday Night Lights 
and worked on developing his re-
lationship with UF’s coaches.He attended the camp a day af-
ter taking a visit to FSU and spoke favorably of each school’s football program.
“I know where I’m leaning, but 
I’m probably going to sit down with my parents and talk things over,” Waisome said after the camp last month.
His top five schools are Flori-
da, Florida State, South Carolina, Georgia and LSU.44, ALLIGATOR, NEW STUDENT EDITION � MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010
Tim Casey / GatorCountry.com
James Wilder Jr., the No. 3 recruit in the nation according to Rivals.
com, is scheduled to make an oral commitment Wednesday. 
Wilder set to announce decision
said. “Injuries are humbling because people put you on a 
pedestal when you play for the Gators, and when you get an injury, you’re that forgotten guy. 
“It was a humbling experience for him, and he’s healed 
from his back, and it looks like he’s having a great year this year.”
BOUNCING BACK
After the Sugar Bowl in January, Brown said he finally 
started to see improvement with his back. 
He went through spring practice and is battling Moses 
Jenkins for the starting spot opposite Janoris Jenkins, and while he says he’s fully healthy for the first time since the spring of 2008, every play can be a challenge.
The physical pain is mostly gone. He still feels tight-
ness in his back from time to time, but that’s something he says he just has to tough out. 
Besides, that’s much better than the sharp, stinging 
pain that plagued him before.
The bigger issue is one faced by many athletes recov-
ering from serious injury: playing without fear of another ailment.
“It’s still tough,” Brown said. “I’d be ly-
ing if I said, ‘Mentally, I’m just ready to go.’ 
There are certain things I second-guess, like 
should I really just go up and throw myself 
in there? In the back of my head I’m just thinking, ‘Man, this might be my back again.’”
With his recovery complete, the mental hurdle is the 
final one for Brown to clear.
One of his close friends, safety Will Hill, said he sees 
Brown hitting his stride, but he’s still waiting for him to regain his confidence and hit his full potential.
“I [told Brown], ‘By you being 100 percent, by you be-
ing on the field, it makes me a better safety,’” Hill said. “I know what type of player he is and the things we expect 
out of him. I know what he can do and what he could 
become.”Second corner spot 
still up for grabs

Last season the Gators did not win the Southeastern Conference for the ﬁ  rst time in 19 seasons.
On top of that, they lost the school’s all-time digs leader, Elyse Cusack, to  graduation. But the 
outlook on the upcoming season is still bright. 
Florida returns All-American Kelly Murphy, who recorded a school-record ni ne triple-doubles 
last season, and outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel. But UF experienced some unexpected departures in the offseason when s etter Brynja Rodgers 
and outside hitter Colleen Ward transferred.Coach Mary Wise will attempt to ﬁ  ll those voids with incoming transfers Stephanie Ferrell, Cinthya Roberto and Tangerine Wiggs. Meanwhile, senior Erin Fleming w ill be the starting libero 
in place of Cusack.Fleming did not start a match last season but will be looked upon as a cat alyst for the Gators of-
fense this year.A mix of veterans will ﬁ  ll out the rest of the lineups.Coach Amanda Butler’s future looked bright after her ﬁ  rst two seasons with the Gators. But after taking a step back last year, Butler will need to rally her squad if she want s to get UF on par with 
conference powerhouses Tennessee and LSU.This season could prove to be the most challenging campaign under Butl er’s leadership. UF will 
have to replace about 56 percent of its offense from a team that ﬁ  nished just 15-17 last season. 
Optimists could see the large amount of turnover as a positive after such a  mediocre season, but 
Butler will have a difﬁ  cult time replacing senior guard Stefﬁ   Sorensen, who led the Gators with a 9.6 scoring average and 83 three-pointers.A telling sign of the frustration at UF last season was the transfer of unde rclassmen Christal 
Caldwell, Tessah Holt and Trumae Lucas. Those departures, combined w ith ﬁ  ve graduating 
seniors, leave only six returnees. In response, Butler hit the recruiting trai ls hard in a rebuilding 
effort and hauled in six preps, most notably Deaundra Young, a 6-foot-2 po wer forward from 
Titusville Astronaut High.
The men’s golf team will lose its two top golfers from last season with the gra duation of Tyson 
Alexander and Tim McKenney. 
Seniors Bank Vongvanij, who shot under par in two of the ﬁ  nal four events of the spring season, 
and Alex Echavarria, who ﬁ  nished the NCAA Championships at even par, will lead the team in 
the fall with the absence of Alexander and McKenney.However, the women’s golf team will return its ﬁ  ve starters this year.
Senior Jessica Yadloczky and juniors Evan Jensen and Andrea Watts wil l be looked upon to 
make the jump and provide veteran leadership. Sophomore Isabelle Lendl  will attempt to build 
upon her stellar freshman season. They hope to carry the Gators into the  NCAA Championships 
this year, a tournament they missed in the spring. 
STATE OF THE PROGRAM
FOOTBALL MEN’S BASKETBALL
WOMEN’S TENNIS
SWIMMINGMEN’S TENNIS
SOCCER
GOLF CROSS COUNTRYThe Gators enter this season hoping to win their ﬁ  fth-consecutive Southeastern Conference 
Championship, and the team might need to lean on its offense to extend  that streak. UF returns 
its top ﬁ  ve scorers from 2009, including redshirt sophomore McKenzie Barney, who led the Gators with seven goals in conference play. When Barney emerged as an offensive leader late in the season, coach Becky Burleigh moved her to the team’s lone forward position. But that move could be short-lived a s redshirt senior Ashlee 
Elliott, the team’s starting forward entering 2009, returns for a ﬁ  fth season after suffering a torn 
ACL early last year. Regardless of where Elliott and Barney line up, the G ators will have plenty of 
offensive options. And the team will need them, as three of the four starti ng defenders from UF’s 
season-ending loss to Oregon State are gone. With a women’s national title and men’s National Swimmer of the Year, l ast season was a big one 
for the UF swimming program. Both squads will hope to build on that succes s when this year’s 
schedule kicks off on Sept. 25. The UF men’s swim team returns Brett Fraser, Sebastien Rousseau, Rodi on Davelaar, Joey Pe-
draza and Conor Dwyer, the 2010 Division I National Men’s Swimmer of t he Year. 
The women’s squad will have to overcome the loss of 2010 Female Dive r of the Year Kara 
Salamone but retains SEC Female Swimmer of the Year Gemma Spoffo rth. The Gators will also 
be celebrating the debut of a notable newcomer, freshman Elizabeth Beis el, who broke a 26-year-
old UF record in the 400-meter individual medley and the school mark f or the 200 IM during a 
competition this month.There's two ways to look at the upcoming UF basketball season. The tea m is returning all ﬁ  ve of 
its starters, so either it will be better for all its experience, or it will be about  the same for its small 
amount of turnover. 
Coach Billy Donovan got the Gators to commit to defense a year ago, bu t easy baskets were hard 
to come by, a trend that could continue without much of a change in the t eam's ball handlers. 
Freshman Patric Young, a McDonald's All-American, is the biggest additi on to the roster, as he 
comes in with similar hype as Kenny Boynton did a year ago. Young is a phys ical front court 
banger.Small forward Chandler Parsons took his game to the next level a season  ago and will be counted 
on to lead this team in his senior season, even with fellow seniors Vernon  Macklin and Alex Tyus 
around. 
Macklin showed the potential that made him a top recruit coming out of hi gh school at various 
times in 2009, but he was inconsistent from game to game. And Tyus dropped hi s ﬁ  eld goal per-
centage from 59.1 his sophomore season to 50.3 his junior year. If he ca n't return to his efﬁ  cient 
form, he could lose a lot of minutes to Young and sophomore Erik Mur phy. 
The biggest question might be whether UF's young backcourt from a seas on ago can make the 
leap. Junior Erving Walker struggled at times with his new position at po int guard, and sopho-
more Kenny Boynton's outside shot was nonexistent for much of the year.
The UF women’s cross country team is coming off a stellar season in whi ch it won three of seven 
events. 
But this season it will be without one of its better runners: Stacey Johnson . She ﬁ  nished in the 
top 10 in four of the ﬁ  ve events she competed in last fall. The squad closed out the season with a seventh-place ﬁ  nish in the NCAA Championships.Things are different with the UF men’s cross country team.The men did not have quite the season they were looking for as they faile d to earn a bid to the 
NCAA Championship.But the Gators hope to change that this year. They return Anthony Mora les, who was the ﬁ  rst UF 
runner to ﬁ  nish in three of the ﬁ  ve competitions he participated in.After falling in the NCAA Round of 16 last spring, the men's tennis team  will look to rebound 
by leaning on Paris-based senior Alexandre Lacroix. Competing in the No . 1 singles position for 
the Gators and teaming with then-senior Antoine Benneteau last year, La croix won a combined 
65 matches, ending the season as an Intercollegiate Tennis Association A ll-American and ranked 
No. 12 nationally.Including Lacroix, the Gators return ﬁ  ve of their six singles competitors from the team's season-
ending loss against Georgia. Expect the biggest improvement from sophomo res Bob Van Over-
beek and Sekou Bangoura Jr. The duo earned SEC All-Freshmen Team  honors last spring after 
enrolling at UF in January. Getting more time to work with coach Andy Ja ckson can only improve 
both players.
The team's biggest hurdle will be replacing Benneteau, a career 42-19 sin gles competitor. But if 
losing the No. 3 singles player is the biggest concern, expectations should be hi gh this upcoming 
season.For the ﬁ  rst time in a long while, expectations for Florida football are a bit tempered. That comes with losing leaders and NFL talents like Tim Tebow, Brandon Spikes, Jo e Haden and Aaron 
Hernandez, but strong recruiting classes have kept the roster full of ability. P otential aside, there 
are plenty of questions about this team that won’t be answered until at lea st a few games into the 
season.Quarterback John Brantley faces the biggest challenge: taking over an offens e with an inexpe-
rienced receiving corps and doing it in the wake of Tebow’s departure. A ll eyes will be on the 
redshirt junior, and he’ll lean on a veteran offensive line and stable of run ning backs, led by Jeff 
Demps and Emmanuel Moody.Andre Debose and Chris Rainey will be the spark plugs at the slot receiver ro le formerly held by 
Percy Harvin, and quarterback-turned-tight end Jordan Reed will take ov er for Hernandez.
A host of big names are gone from the defense, but a mix of seasoned pl ayers and highly touted 
youngsters will ﬁ  ll the holes. The secondary needs a solid corner opposite Janoris Jenkins but 
should be the best unit, and depth on the defensive line and at linebacker s hould mean heavy 
rotations to keep players fresh.
The Gators won’t have a ton of time to work out the kinks, either. An uncha racteristically chal-
lenging non-conference game with USF comes in Week 2, followed by tr ips to Tennessee and 
defending champ Alabama in two of the next three games.
The women’s tennis team came close to capturing the NCAA Champions hip, only to fall short 
4-3 against Stanford in May. While rebuilding for another run at the title , coach Roland Thorn-
qvist can rest easy knowing his squad is set at the top.Florida was led by a pair of sensational freshmen last season in Lauren Embree a nd Allie Will. In 
their loss to the Cardinal, the Gators used Embree and Will in the Nos. 1 and 2 positions, respec-
tively. Embree, the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s National Rookie  of the Year, earned one 
of UF’s two singles victories that day.That win gave Embree her 20th of the spring, lifting her to the No. 8 natio nal ranking at the sea-
son’s conclusion. Will was just as effective in her ﬁ  rst year at UF, going 26-1 in singles competition and ending the year as the No. 11-ranked singles player. 
Thornqvist’s biggest concern this season will be replacing Embree’s doubles partner, Marrit Boon-
stra. Boonstra, a three-time All-American, was a combined 152-39 betwe en singles and doubles 
play at UF.By TYLER JETT

Andre Debose said he didn’t 
want the hype, not that fans were 
going to oblige. 
When Debose signed with UF 
in 2009, he immediately drew com-parisons to Percy Harvin. The You-Tube highlight tapes showed De-bose could be a matchup nightmare with his big-play potential when the ball was in his hands or in the air, making him a natural fit to re-place Harvin in the Gators’ hybrid position.
In the weeks before and after 
National Signing Day, Debose tried to convince outsiders that he wasn’t Percy 2.0. But the comparisons kept coming, and even coach Urban Meyer wasn’t helping him stay out 
of the spotlight.
“I’ve got to tell you, this Andre 
Debose — I know I can’t single guys 
out, but I’m going to single him out,” Meyer said after he signed. “He’s as good as there is. I think he’s the best player in America. … Before I came down here, I flipped on his highlight tape one more time 
so I’ll leave with a big smile on my 
face.” 
Before he could practice with the 
Gators, however, Debose suffered a hamstring injury in May 2009 while running track for Sanford Seminole High. Once he enrolled, UF train-ers discovered Debose had tendon damage that required season-end-ing surgery.
But Debose called the injury “a 
blessing in disguise.” While fans became infatuated with the Gators’ newest crop of recruits, Debose slipped away from the center of at-tention.
“I like the anonymous Andre 
Debose,” he said at UF’s media day on Aug. 10. “I’m not too much into the rah-rah, always in the spotlight (players). That’s not me at all.”
As much as he likes that ambi-
guity, though, Debose will soon find himself back in the limelight as he and junior Chris Rainey compete for playing time at the slot position made famous by Harvin. And with that attention comes pressure, as the performance of whoever plays in the hybrid role could determine how explosive UF’s offense will be this season.
With Debose injured and Rainey 
at running back last year, the Gators did not have a player with the skill set to be a dual-threat like Harvin had been. In 2008, Harvin touched the ball 110 times, leading to 1,303 yards of total offense and 17 touch-downs.
Last season, receiver Riley Coo-
per led all non-return men with 975 yards of total offense — all but 14 of which came through the air. 
UF wants defenses to account for 
the slot receiver running the ball, though, and receivers coach Zach Azzanni said Rainey has a slight edge because of his experience and the extra 15 practices he spent in the 
hybrid spot during the spring.
For his part, Debose’s athletic 
ability could give defensive coor-
dinators nightmares, Azzanni said. But getting back on the field, and into the spotlight, will depend on his ability to learn the offense.
“He runs really fast and he 
jumps really high and he has great 
body position catching the ball,” 
Azzanni said. “Now it’s my job to make sure he does all the other things, the details.” MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010 � NEW STUDENT EDITION, ALLIGATOR, 47

 This season is going to be different for Flori-
da offensive lineman Mike Pouncey.
  When his twin brother, Maurkice, decided to 
forgo his senior season and enter the NFL Draft, 
it marked the ﬁ  rst time the two wouldn’t play on the same team.
  But Mike has taken full advantage of his 
alone time in the offseason and has begun to carve out his own identity.
  “I knew when I decided to come back to 
school that I was going to have to take on that role with  (Tim) Tebow and (Brandon) Spikes leaving,” Mike said. “I just accepted it and I’ve 
taken it on with a full head of steam.”
  Mike isn’t just stepping into his brother’s 
leadership role from last season, he will also be 
moving one spot over from guard to center — the position Maurkice played at Florida.
  The similarities don’t stop there.   Teammates hardly notice Maurkice is gone 
because the two have such similar personalities. Mike keeps the locker room loose with his sense 
of humor, but he also knows when it’s time to 
work and get serious.
  “They are true twins,” redshirt senior Carl 
Johnson said. “They are identical. Those two act the same no matter what they are doing. It’s kind of like having a little bit of Maurkice here with Mike.”
  In his UF career, Mike has played on both 
sides of the ball and earned a starting job as a 
freshman. Both things have helped him become 
one of the most respected players on the team. 
  Mike’s way of leading will be similar to that 
of a former UF player.
  “Mike is our head-and-above-shoulders leader this year — the Tebow,” Johnson said. “He has that same will. He just can’t begin to 
think of losing.”
  With UF’s new quarterback, John Brantley, 
possessing a quiet, low-key demeanor, Mike 
will be vital in helping maintain intensity on the offensive side of the ball.
  “I’m not going to be doing the hoo-rah kind 
of stuff,” Brantley said. “But that’s why we have other guys on the team that will do that stuff to get the team going.”
  However, Mike knows there are other things 
that come with being one of the faces of the team. The offseason allegations involving his brother taking $100,000 from an agent before he left UF have been a wake up call.
  He said he thinks twice before doing any-
thing because he knows he has a target on his back now.
  With his brother playing for the Pittsburgh 
Steelers, people are noticing a different mental-ity from the 6-foot-4, 310-pound senior.
  “I see a guy that’s really set on being a lead-
er,” said offensive coordinator Steve Addazio, who also handles the offensive line. “I’m really enjoying that side of him. He’s always had great personality, but it’s kind of his own leadership-side personality coming out now. It’s not a tag 
team — it’s his deal.” 48, ALLIGATOR, NEW STUDENT EDITION � MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010

 It hasn’t been as eventful as June, but 
since the start of July, the Gators have made 
strides along the recruiting trail.
  UF picked up six oral commitments 
in June: four-star wide receiver Javares McRoy, three-star fullback Hunter Joyer, three-star offensive lineman Tommy Jor-dan, four-star linebacker Ryan Shazier, three-star wide receiver Ja’Juan Story and kicker Kyle Christy.
  Since July 1, the Gators have landed com-
mitments from three more recruits, held their Friday Night Lights camp, reafﬁ  rmed commitments from a couple prospects and put themselves in position to land some of the top talent in the state.
  In the hours leading up to the team’s sixth 
annual Friday Night Lights camp, which is one of the biggest recruiting events in the nation, UF added the 11th and 12th mem-bers to its 2011 football recruiting class.
  First, the Gators landed a verbal from 
Dover, Del., four-star offensive lineman Trip Thurman, who joins Jordan as the only two commits on the line so far. 
Thurman made his commitment while 
visiting UF.
  “I knew that Florida was where I want-
ed to be, so I made my decision,” Thurman told the Gainesville Sun.
  After that, UF shored up a commitment 
from Pensacola Pine Forest defensive back Louchiez Purifoy. While he is not rated by Rivals.com, Purifoy garnered offers from Auburn and Alabama before choosing Florida.
  Later that day when UF held its Friday 
Night Lights camp, some of the top talent from the state and other prospects from around the country took the ﬁ  eld at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium to try to impress the UF coaching staff.
  While many recruits were trying to earn 
 UF’s 2011 recruiting class up to 13 oral commits“I knew when I decided to come 
back to school that I was going to 
have to take on that role with  (Tim) 
Tebow and (Brandon) Spikes leav-
ing.”

Welcome to Florida. Take 
out your notebook, grab a pen and get ready to 
take your first class because I’m about to drop some knowledge on the incoming freshmen. 
One of the most important 
and fun elements of your college experience will be going to foot-ball games at Ben Hill Griffin Sta-dium (we’ll start the lesson here: we call it “The Swamp”), so I’m 
about to arm you with five help-
ful pieces of advice. 
I present to you: Swamptology 
101.
Make a block: The only thing 
better than watching a game with a handful of your closest friends is watching a game with 20 or 30 
of your closest friends. 
Blocks aren’t just for sororities 
and frats, anyone can form one 
by gathering some Gator1s and 
attending a meeting. The Uni-
versity Athletic Association will say you need a certain amount of people (I think it’s 25. I don’t remember because it’s not impor-tant), but they’re very good about working with you if you come up 
a couple people shy. 
Your high fives and chest 
pounds will significantly increase 
in a block. The one downside is 
taking on the role of block leader. 
For some reason, friends like to make it as hard as possible on you to get them their tickets. 
 For all you block leaders out 
there, I’ve been in your shoes, and I’m sorry. 
Tailgate: Somewhere. Any-
where. But make sure you tail-gate. Set up a grill, grab some beer and get a cornhole set be-cause tailgating is just as much a part of gameday tradition as tim-
eouts and touchdowns. 
The first two home games are 
noon and 12:21 p.m. starts, so I’m 
going to rock your world: post-
game tailgating is not only OK 
but encouraged in this college town. 
Grill out and drink up be-fore head-ing home to shower 
and go out 
on Saturday night. There are plenty 
of great 
spots up and down U n i v e r s i t y 
Avenue and various apartment 
complexes. Do your homework 
and find a spot. 
Don’t get too drunk: I know, 
brah, kickoff isn’t for another hour and you can pound six more Genny Lights (if you haven’t ex-perienced Genny Light, let’s just say those six cans will set you 
back about $2), but you will re-
gret that decision when you’re going on hour three of standing on the bleachers in the 95-degree 
heat. 
When you’re partying the 
Friday night before a day game, 
drink a Gatorade before you go to bed and a Vitamin Water Re-vive when you wake up so you can make it to the game before 
the end of the first quarter. Don’t 
be that guy who stumbles into the stadium, falls off the bleach-ers and throws up all over the bro 
wearing the Croakies and boat 
shoes in front of you.  
The dude in the red hat is 
your friend: When the game 
goes to a commercial (timeouts, end of a quarter, play under re-view, etc.), an official in a red hat will walk onto the field. This is a 
powerful man, despite his amus-
ing attire, and the game will start when, and only when, he walks off the field. 
Why am I telling you this? Af-
ter you ignore tip No. 3, you’re going to want to milk those rare sit down opportunities for all they’re worth. While your 
friends are all standing a min-
ute longer than need be because they don’t know when the action will resume, you can be sure to maximize your sit-down time by keeping tabs on the dude in the red hat. 
Learn the players’ numbers: 
It’s near impossible to read a name off a jersey from 85 rows 
up, so start getting to know the 
roster by numbers. Just because the running back takes the ball, that doesn’t mean Jeff Demps was running it. And just because 
a defensive end sacks the quar-
terback, that doesn’t mean it was Justin Trattou bringing him down.
In football, you’re allowed to 
do this thing called “substitut-ing,”  so don’t be the one cheer-ing on John Brantley in the fourth quarter of a blowout when Trey 
Burton is in the game. 
For the returning classes, 
there’s a lot of turnover on the 
roster, and it’s insulting to both 
Andre Debose and everyone 
around you to keep calling him “Wondy.” Yeah, he wears No. 4, but its not funny.

Three-star 
DE/OT com-
mits to Gators
attention, the coaches were making 
sure that they held onto commit-ments from a handful of recruits that already pledged to come to Florida.
  Following their showings at the 
camp, a few UF commits reafﬁ  rmed their intentions to sign with the Gators, including Deland four-star athlete De’Ante “Pop” Saunders.
  Four-star tight end A.C. Leonard, 
who committed to UF in November, also reiterated his plans.
  “I’m still solid,” Leonard said.  Asheville, N.C., four-star defen-
sive end Jeoffrey Pagan was thought 
to be wavering on his verbal to UF 
after telling the Asheville Citizen-
Times in June that he was close to 50 percent on UF. But after Fri-
day Night Lights, Pa-
gan said he remained 
fully committed to the 
Gators and would not 
make visits to other schools once the season began.
  In August, UF received a commit-
ment from three-star defensive end Chase Hounshell, who will play of-
fensive tackle in college despite see-
ing some time at defensive end in 
high school.
  The Gators also vaulted them-
selves to the top of a few elite re-
cruits’ lists in the wake of Friday 
Night Lights.
  “If they run the ball and win games 
… I’m here,” four-star running back Mike Blakely said. “As long as the 
running back gets the ball, (the of-
fense) doesn’t matter.”
  Dwyer’s Curt Maggitt, the No. 
12 defensive end in the nation, also placed UF atop his list of schools, as 
did South Lake four-star cornerback 
Nick Waisome, who plans to an-
nounce his decision on Aug. 18. COMMITS , from page 48
Signing day is months away, but the UF coaching staff has already received 13 oral

The Miami Heat have a Big Three, and now the Gators 
have theirs.
“Ronald Powell is Chris Bosh, Sharrif (Floyd) is Dwy-
ane Wade and I’m LeBron (James),” defensive tackle Do-
minique Easley said.
The trio of freshman defensive linemen comes into its 
first season at Florida with a lot of hype. Powell, Floyd and Easley were respectively ranked the Nos. 1, 4 and 7 recruits of the 2010 class according to Rivals.com.
But they aren’t backing down from the pressure that 
comes with those accolades.
“I do want to be the best defensive end in America,” Powell said. “As far as expectations, my expectations are a lot higher than everybody else’s.”
Defensive line coach Dan McCarney is known to rotate 
players on the defensive front throughout the game to uti-lize UF’s depth, which bodes well for the three to receive 
playing time immediately.
And they won’t need to bulk up too much 
before they’re physically ready to play.
Powell has already benchpressed 225 
pounds 21 times in one set, Floyd is tipping 
the scales at 300 pounds and Easley is not far behind him at 280 pounds.
“I definitely expect to play,” Powell said. “I can tell 
you one thing about this class, none of these guys want to 
sit and wait. None of us.”
But their playing time this season is expected to come as members of the second-string team.
Their relationship began early. 
Following Easley’s commitment to Florida after the 
Under Armour All-America Game on Jan. 2, he sold the school to Powell and Floyd. 
The two then followed in Easley’s footsteps and chose 
Florida a week later at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.
The trio comes in as five-star recruits, but that doesn’t 
matter to them.
“Take away all the stars, we don’t care about them,” 
Powell said.
With defensive ends Justin Trattou and Duke Lem-
mens, defensive tackle Terron Sanders and nose guard Lawrence Marsh leaving after this season, the freshmen could be pushed to the forefront as soon as next year.
“We can do a lot of great things here,” Floyd said. 
“We can get a lot of stuff rolling and we can have the SEC scared of us. We can have it all.”52, ALLIGATOR, NEW STUDENT EDITION � MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010
Welcome to Year 1, A.T.
Many of you arriving at UF this 
year are no doubt lamenting the 
timing that caused you to miss watching the 
Tim Tebow-led Gators by one season, but there’s plenty to look forward to in 2010.
When I showed up on campus in 2006, 
it was for the start of Tebow’s reign. And thanks to four years of dedicated procrasti-nation, I’ll get to see some of the post-Tebow era as well.
This year’s team is mostly a blank slate, 
and its development during the season should be fascinating to watch.
New stars and leaders will emerge (well, 
they better, because if they don’t, the Gators are headed to the Capital One Bowl or worse).And with Tebow gone, the dawn of a 
new age of Gators football is upon us.
Two words have been closely associated 
with UF in the past four years: “Tebow” and “winning.”
The Chosen One boosted his program’s 
profile and was the unquestioned face of the 
school during his time in Gainesville, and a 
new identity will be emerging soon.
Changes are in store as far as this team’s 
marketability goes, but there’s no reason to think the wins will disappear. Urban Mey-
er’s recruiting wizardry has kept a stockpile 
of talent on hand, and there should be plenty of motivation for these players to step out of 
the shadows of their predecessors.
John Brantley will try to carve his niche 
in the pantheon of UF quarterbacks, and a stable of running 
backs figures to get a heavier workload 
now that Tebow isn’t 
the first option on the ground.
Meyer has some-
thing to prove, too.
It’s time to find out 
who was really run-ning the show these 
last few years.
When Meyer “retired,” remember all 
those “He just doesn’t want to coach with-out Timmy around” jokes?
The easiest way to quash those rumblings 
is for Meyer to keep winning, and if he does, maybe it means we were watching the “Ur-ban Era” all along and Tebow’s role was overhyped.
Or maybe we’re entering the Age of Ar-
rests, where players getting locked up (two so far this year!) will make UF the new Thug U without a Bible-verse-toting face hiding the ugly side of things.
And maybe the whole concept of what 
era we’re witnessing is just a concept con-jured up by a bored columnist.
But one thing is for sure: when you walk 
out of here in four or five years, the football 
program will look completely different than 
it did before you arrived.
That transition starts now. What lies 
ahead is unknown, and while it doesn’t car-ry the guaranteed wins of the recent past, it should be plenty entertaining.New era of Gators football will be uncertain but fun to watch

The best response to being 
asked how you will replace a two-time-national-cham-
pion, Heisman-trophy-winning quarterback whose likeness is being constructed into a statue in the very location you are asked to 
replace him:
“First of all, I want everyone 
to know I could just as soon ig-
nore this question. Or worse, I could pretend like I’ve never 
thought about replacing him. 
Anything negative I say about the guy — or even anything that can be PERCEIVED as negative 
(see: Thompson, Deonte) — will 
be blown out of proportion. 
But this isn’t a new question. 
Everyone asks me this. Or at least everyone who recognizes me on 
the street, which is still a pretty small population, thank God.
The answer is simple: I’m go-
ing to be as different from the other guy as I can be. And we will 
win a lot. Not despite our differ-ences, but because of them.
I know he was good, trust me. 
I watched him from the sidelines for three years. And I know you loved him. I’ve seen all those “15” jerseys in the stands, seen the “Marry Me!” signs held by 
6-year-old daughters, even seen 
that wood carving of him on Newberry Road.
And seriously, boosters? 
You’re building a statue? As soon as he leaves? It’s like I’m replac-ing a cross between Herschel Walker and Paul Bunyan.
It’s not the man himself I have 
to live up to. It’s the man’s legacy. The mys-tique. The Focus-on-
the-Family 
endorsing, Jockey-w e a r i n g , 
bronze-stat-
ue legend.
T h a t ’ s 
not to dis-
credit the actual player. He was 
an All-American. He scored about 
700 touchdowns. He could rally a team at the half just by yelling uninteresting things like “Let’s 
go!” and getting red in the face.
I’m not going to do that. Not 
because it doesn’t sound fun. Not 
because it doesn’t work. But be-cause he did it. I’m not him, and 
I’m sure you guys will remind me of that the moment I mess up, 
so I might as well distance myself right now.  
If I don’t see a wide-open re-
ceiver, check the stadium’s light-ing. Chances are his shadow has made it too dark for me to see 
clearly. To be fair, he didn’t put 
this pressure on me. You guys did.
You guys fell in love with 
him. Fell in love with the way 
he lowered his shoulder, injuries 
be damned. Fell in love with the way he visibly appeared to hate losing more than anyone else. 
Fell in love with the way he stood 
for something and, in a society of camera phones with Internet ac-cess, never got caught doing any-thing worse than pose next to a 
girl with huge boobs.  But what does any of that have 
to do with his play? Remember 
that national championship game 
in 2007, when he was just a back-
up and the starting quarterback completed like 70 percent of his passes? All most people wanted 
to talk about was the backup who 
went 1 for 1 with a 1-yard touch-down. 
So now he’s gone, and you 
guys still want to talk about him. 
I expect it. Understand it, even. 
But you know our offense can be good without him. You are the same people who picked us third 
in the preseason poll. 
Don’t ask me anything else 
about him, because if we succeed, 
it won’t be because of him. But if we lose, it could be because of 
him. And, in a way, you.”
A speech Brantley should make, even if we don’t want to hear it

Facebook is a registered trademark of Facebook, Inc.Rosa Taveras / Alligator StaffContenders: Jeremy Brown and Moses Jenkins
What they bring: 
A back injury has kept Jeremy Brown off the ﬁ  eld in his ﬁ  rst 
two years at UF, but his talent cannot be questioned. Before the 
injury, he was listed above Janoris Jenkins on the depth chart. If he can stay healthy, he is the team’s second most talented corner.
 Senior Moses Jenkins brings veteran experience. With Joe 
Haden and Major Wright now in the NFL, the secondary is in need of a veteran presence. Although he is not as talented as Brown, he could ﬁ  ll that void.
Our Pick: If Jeremy Brown can stay healthy, he will be the 
starting cornerback opposite of Janoris Jenkins. Coach Urban Meyer is known to play the most talented players regardless of experience. If he stays true to this methodology, Brown is the 
guy.
 
Contenders: Jon Bostic and Jelani Jenkins
What they bring:Contenders: Omar Hunter, Terron Sanders, Jaye Howard, Lawrence Marsh, 
Brandon Antwine, Sharrif Floyd and Dominique Easley
What they bring:
By the eyeball test, Bostic is the prototypical replacement for Brandon Spikes. 
His 6-foot-1, 238-pound frame makes him an imposing ﬁ  gure, and he plays fast, 
too. He played in 12 games as a freshman on special teams and as a backup, leading his classmates with 18 tackles.
Jenkins is smaller by about an inch and 15 pounds, and his best attribute is 
his speed. The two-way high school star has a knack for ﬁ  nding the action, and with a quick burst of speed he looks like a wrecking ball once he picks out a target. 
Our Pick: Jenkins has a lot to offer, and as linebackers coach D.J. Durkin 
said, he’ll ﬁ  nd a way onto the ﬁ  eld. But Bostic seems like the better ﬁ  t here because of his size, so we’re giving him the nod. Expect to see both play a lot, though, as Durkin plans to rotate often.Omar Hunter had a nice spring and has lost 
35 pounds since last season. Right now he is 
listed as the starting nose tackle.
Terron Sanders (knee), Lawrence Marsh 
(hips) and Brandon Antwine (knee) are all com-ing off of injuries. All three say they are at 100 percent, but it will be interesting to see if they are ready for the season opener. Defensive line coach Dan McCarney called Antwine one of the most talented players on the team.
Jaye Howard came to UF as a defensive end, 
but he has since bulked up to over 300 pounds and is now competing for the starting defensive tackle spot. He is quicker than most at the posi-tion because of  his history as an end.
Highly-touted freshmen Sharrif Floyd and 
Dominique Easley will need time to develop.
Our Pick: This race is still up for grabs, but 
McCarney said Jaye Howard and Omar Hunter would be the starters if the season started today. The Gators like to keep their defensive linemen fresh with a constant rotation of play-ers, so look for all of them to get a chance to play.MONDAY, AUGUST 16, 2010 � NEW STUDENT EDITION, ALLIGATOR, 55
