� ABOUT 89.3 MILLION 
VISITED FLORIDA IN 2012.

Larry Glines knows the way to Flor-
ida well. The 19-year-old UF physics 
freshman, born and raised in Las Ve-gas, made the trip to Florida with his family frequently, visiting Gainesville 
before attending UF.
He was just one of the millions 
of visitors who ﬂ  ock to the Sunshine 
State each year.
A record 89.3 million visitors came 
to Florida in 2012, breaking the 2011 record by about two million, accord-ing to a Visit Florida press release.
This increase can also be seen in 
Gainesville. John Pricher, assistant director of Visit Gainesville, said UF accounts for most of the visitors to Gainesville, especially during football season and graduation.
In 2012, about 1,765,000 people 
stayed in Alachua County hotel rooms, an increase of more than 3 percent from 2011, according to Smith Travel Research.
As Florida’s tourism numbers con-
tinue to increase, some believe 2013 will be  another record-breaking year.
“Obviously the past is a good pre-
dictor of the future, and considering that Florida continues to grow, I don’t see why it wouldn’t,” said Jordan Meyer, director of communications and marketing at the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce.
Glines said he’s glad to be staying 
in Florida for longer than just a visit.
“I like the people, and I kind of like 
the rain because I come from the des-ert,” he said.Florida, Gainesville

Gainesville Police is investigating a 
Saturday morning armed robbery and at-
tempted rape at a southwest Gainesville 
apartment complex.
At about 3 a.m. Saturday, a woman 
was walking down the second-ﬂ  oor stair-
well of Building D of The Enclave Apart-ments complex, located at 3000 SW 35th Place, when a man wearing black clothing approached her with a knife, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
The man ﬁ  rst asked for the woman’s 
wallet and keys and then attacked her, forcing her to bend over and put her hands on the stairs, Tobias said.
The woman pushed the man and tried to run away. In the process, her tooth was 
knocked out, Tobias said.
The woman’s friend heard her scream 
and ran back to the stairwell, Tobias said.
The man then pulled out a silver hand-
gun and pointed it at the friend.
Both women ran away to a car, where 
another friend was waiting for them and 
drove them to Shands at UF, Tobias said.
When GPD arrived at the complex, an 
ofﬁ  cer found Roderick Kantrel Pittman, 28, of 2427 NW 147th St., outside Building D, Tobias said.
Pittman told the ofﬁ  cer that he walked 
to the apartment complex from the Ridge-mar Commons Apartments, located in 
the 3600 block of Southwest 34th Street, 
to meet with a girl in Building C, Tobias said.
The ofﬁ  cer noticed that Pittman had a 
cut on his arm. Pittman said he got the cut from jumping over a fence.
The ofﬁ  cer searched Pittman and found Police investigates robbery, sexual battery at the Enclave

Welcome to the conversation.
Those were the words that 
TEDxUF 2013 curator Stefan 
Wolff said Saturday as he wel-
comed the audience of about 1,600 people.
The independently organized 
TEDxUF event brought togeth-er nine speakers who embody TED’s main principle — “ideas worth spreading.”
“TED is not to make yourself 
famous. It’s not to get paid,” said Wolff, a 20-year-old economics junior. “It’s because you feel like you have a story worth sharing.”
The speakers were united by a 
theme of “Pursuing Passion,” but they covered a wide array of top-ics, including gene therapy, ﬁ  nd-
ing your authentic self and racial 
issues.
This was the fourth TEDx event held at UF, and it has quickly proved itself to TED or-ganizers.
“As of last year, we’re in the 
top 10 percent of all TEDx confer-ences in the world,” Wolff said.The ranking is based on the 
number of people attending, which makes TEDxUF one of the biggest TEDx events in the 
world.
The popularity of TED drew 
volunteer Sara Schwartz.
Schwartz, a 19-year-old archi-
tecture sophomore, had watched 
many TED videos over the years.
“I’m really interested in the 
ones about design, but they’re all really good, honestly,” Schwartz said.
A favorite speaker of 
Schwartz’s was Rebecca Brown, the head of the Streetlight pro-gram, which pairs volunteer col-lege students with ill or dying 
teenagers.
Brown’s moving speech on 
death and dying brought many 
in the audience to tears, Schwartz 
said.

March 1, 1979: Kappa Alpha fraternity reported their Con-
federate flag as stolen. The 4-by-8-foot “stars ‘n’ bars” flag was 
taken in the middle of the night from the fraternity house din-
ing room wall, according to fraternity member William Wag-
ner. He said it went missing a week earlier, but he didn’t re-port the theft because he thought the flag had been taken to the cleaners.
Feb. 27, 1986: The committee that oversees UF research 
projects postponed a UF neurosurgeon’s proposal to study brain damage in monkeys. Dr. Christian Leonard’s research plan included suctioning off parts of the monkeys’ brains and 
then studying their social behavior. She suspected the monkey 
would become withdrawn and depressed after the surgery . 
They would be killed after the experiment. Local animal rights advocates attended the committee meeting in protest of such research projects.
Feb. 29, 1996: MTV talent scouts came to UF to find acts 
for a new season of their show “Fame or Shame.” They said they wanted as many weird acts as possible for the “quirky talent show full of stupid human tricks.” Some of the “talents” 
included blowing spaghetti through one’s nose or tap dancing 
in flippers. About 500 people showed up for the first day of 
auditions.
March 1, 2002: Lohse Beeland, the director of student activi-
ties, calculated the total cost of all the fliers and other promo-
tional materials handed out around campus to be $72,000. This 
did not include the cost to create the fliers. It was simply a cal-culation of how much money it cost for the UF Physical Plant Division to clean up the ensuing litter. Each event promoted on 
campus was thought to cost $570.
— KRISTAN WIGGINS� TRAFFIC WAS 
TEMPORARILY SHUT DOWN.
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Staff Writer
A two-car crash sent three 
people to the hospital and caused 
westbound traffic near the intersec-tion of Southwest Archer Road and 
Gale Lemerand Drive to shut down 
Friday afternoon.
At about 1:30 p.m., Jerome Wil-
liams was headed west on South-
west Archer Road in his white Ford 
Expedition.
Williams, 40, drove at a “high 
rate of speed” while in the center 
lane, said Gainesville Police spokes-man Officer Ben Tobias, and when he tried to switch to the right-hand 
lane, his car slammed into the back 
of a red Ford Mustang.
The Mustang, driven by Coral 
Swiger, 67, of Belleview, Fla., spun 
around and crashed into a palm 
tree, Tobias said. Her husband, 
Ricky Swiger, 64, also of Belleview, 
Fla., was in the passenger seat.
The crash happened in front of 
Shands Medical Plaza, where sev-
eral staff members said they heard 
the cars collide.
Shana Nelson, a 30-year-old 
residency program coordinator for UF’s Department of Radiation 
Oncology, said she heard the tires screeching and saw smoke outside the building.
“We heard two loud booms,” 
she said.
Nelson said five to six plaza staff 
members went to help Williams and the Swigers before police and Gainesville Fire Rescue arrived at the scene.
Police blocked off westbound 
traffic between Southwest 16th Street and Gale Lemerand Drive for more than an hour. Officers also re-directed traffic from Southwest 13th Street to Southwest 16th Avenue.
Tobias said ambulances took 
Williams and the Swigers to Shands at UF for nonlife-threatening inju-ries.
Just after 3 p.m., police reopened 
all westbound lanes on Southwest Archer Road.

To stay current with the regulations af-
fecting credit and debit card payments, the 
university created a committee to establish a standardized policy.
Currently, places that accept credit card 
payments like the Univeristy Athletic As-sociation, the UF Foundation and Shands at UF are on different contracts. The com-mittee wants to make everything consis-tent, said Stuart Hoskins, senior associate controller.
He said the growing popularity of elec-
tronic payments comes with risks, and the committee is concerned with adher -
ing consistently to the rules set in place by credit card companies.
The university is also concerned about 
having airtight policies to keep informa-tion secure, Hoskins said.
“We know we are dealing with very 
sensitive information. Identify theft is a frequent topic. That’s why credit card companies have created these standards,” he said.
The committee is still inviting its mem-
bers but will begin meetings next month.
The agenda will include ensuring the 
privacy and security of payment card data stored and transmit-
ted through UF by developing standards for application pro-
cesses, contracts with 
third parties, terms of use and audit require-ments.
“We need to do everything we can here 
to make sure information is secure,” Hosk-ins said. “We know this is the way people want to pay their bills.”
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes agreed.
“You want your credit cards to be safe, 
don’t you?” she said. “We have a lot of 
you.”

Brown was one of about 30 
speakers solicited before the team 
chose the nine speakers and two 
performers, Wolff said. He said 
his team sought speakers based on their ideas, not their merit.
“The job, at the end of the day, 
of the curator is to make sure the people on stage are doing their ideas justice and really being pro-ponents of ideas worth spread-ing,” Wolff said.
Other than the speakers, a ma-
jor highlight of the TEDxUF event was the possibility to network, said Tommy Goode, a 24-year-
old iOS developer for Feathr, a 
Gainesville startup company that creates applications for confer -
ences.  
Participants’ information was 
gathered at sign-up and upon their arrival, they received a name tag with their information and a 
personal profile on the TEDxUF 
app, developed by Feathr.
“We are hoping that there are 
other conference directors here that are observing and seeing how well this app is going to 
work out,” Goode said.
The app offered a map of the 
event, a schedule and a contact 
list of every attendee.
People could meet new con-
nections and add them to mul-tiple social networks all on one app.
“We were looking for new and 
innovative ways to get to the au-dience and get them to connect with each other, and this was the 
perfect marriage of both needs,” 
Wolff said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2013

� THE COURT WILL
RECONVENE LATER.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Writer
The UF Supreme Court did not come to a 
conclusion Sunday night regarding the con-
stitutionality of UF’s Student Government ex-
ecutive branch’s power to remove directors.
Billy Vranish, the former director of exter -
nal affairs, appealed to the court after Student Body President Tj Villamil fired him Jan. 28.
The court deadlocked over two issues: the 
constitutionality of the Governmental Boards, 
Commissions, and Subsidiary Organizations codes and how they may contradict the UF 
Constitution; and the basis of why Vranish 
was terminated.
The codes state the Student Body presi-
dent and the SG Executive Committee can fire directors because of an action contrary to 
law, a bad job or not doing his or her job. The 
Constitution reads that officers of executive departments can be removed by the Student Body president.Solicitor General Ryan Gilbert, who rep-
resented Villamil in the hearing, argued that 
Villamil terminated Vranish because he was 
not doing his job.
Vranish alleged that Villamil fired him 
because of different political beliefs. Vran-
ish, who was appointed by former Student 
Body President Ben Meyers in May 2011, said 
he was thinking of being Meyers’ campaign manager if Meyers decided to run in the 2013 SG elections, which he didn’t.
Acting Chief Justice Tim Mason said Vran-
ish’s argument might not stand without con-crete evidence that Villamil discriminated for political reasons.
“We’re not equipped to figure out what he 
did or did not say,” he said.
Mason invited Chief Justice Matt Michel 
to join the court at the next hearing to debate the constitutionality of the case. Michel re-cused himself from the hearing because of his 
personal connection with Vranish.
The court will reconvene at a later date to 
further discuss the case.

A group of high school students hit the 
Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail on Satur -
day, raising awareness about the benefits of 
cycling.
The Newberry High School Climate 
Change Corps hosted its Environmental Bike Rally at the Boulware Springs Park trailhead, located at 3300 SE 15th St.
About 10 club members gathered at the en-
trance of the trail, handing out water bottles and granola bars to cyclists and pedestrians.
The students also displayed a cardboard poster that gave information on how a person can reduce his or her carbon footprint. One 
way is through cycling.
Cynthia Holland, a science teacher at New-
berry High and adviser to the Climate Change 
Corps, said cycling not only helps reduce car -
bon emissions, but it can also be a good way to stay fit.
“It’s healthy for the environment and 
healthy for people,” she said, “a win-win situ-ation.”                
Club members interacted with more than 
100 people at the trail, Holland said.
But they didn’t do it alone. Several mem-
bers of the Gainesville Cycling Club helped club members raise awareness to passers-by about cycling.
Allyson Gill, vice president of the 
Gainesville Cycling Club, said the she was im-pressed with the students’ work at the event.
“The kids were very knowledgeable about 
the carbon footprint issue,” she said. “I’m 
proud of what they’re doing.”
The event was part of the club’s participa-
tion in the Lexus Eco Challenge, a national competition among high school and middle 
school students to make a positive impact in the environment, said Blake Stefanelli, a New-berry High junior and club member.
In January , the group was announced as 
a finalist in the Air & Climate portion of the challenge, allowing the students to compete 
for a $30,000 prize in the last round.
As part of their goal to reduce carbon diox-
ide in the atmosphere, Stefanelli said he and 
the others built a solar water heater for the school roof and planted seedlings at the Wa-termelon Pond Wildlife and Environmental Area.
“Not only do we educate people, but we do 
things ourselves to help out,” he said.
For Holland, the events showed students 
the value of volunteering in their community.
“They see how they can make a difference,” 
she said. “It’s really empowering to them.”Newberry High School students join cycling conversation
two condoms and a knife, Tobias said. The officer didn’t find 
a gun on him.
Police then arrested Pittman on a loitering and prowling 
charge.
Later, during a lineup, the victim and her friends couldn’t 
identify Pittman as the man they saw Saturday morning.
Police booked Pittman into the Alachua County Jail just 
after 6 a.m. Saturday. He was released at about 1 p.m. after he met bond.
Tobias said GPD is now turning to the public for help in 
the case.
After an interview with the victim and her friends, Tobi-
as said there may be more possible witnesses to the crime, including two college-aged men in the parking lot and one white man who may had seen the crime from the second floor.

GPD detective Chris King at 352-393-7660. You can also sub-mit an anonymous tip by texting “GPDFL” plus your tip to 274637.

Justin Correll has gotten lucky 
before.
In elementary school, he entered 
a raffle and won a bicycle.
Now, he is getting a new bicycle 
again, this time with some of the 
$25,000 he won in a Kaplan sweep-stakes.
Correll, a UF electrical engineer -ing junior, has led a life not typical to the average college student. 
At age 30, he is back at school 
after joining the workforce as an electrician. 
He’s been back for two years and 
transferred to UF over the Summer in order to make a better career for himself. It was over the Summer in the Reitz Union when he and two friends were approached by a 
Kaplan representative to enter the sweepstakes. 
His friends were skeptical, but 
Correll decided to enter anyway.
Fast-forward to December: Cor -
rell was sitting on a bench, waiting 
for a call from an internship he ap-plied for. 
While going over what he would 
say in the interview, he received a phone call from a number in New York. He answered the call, and a 
woman told him he was the winner of $25,000.
Correll received his check two 
weeks ago. He waited to tell his 
family. He said he and his parents aren’t the type to get excited about things easily, but this was an ex-ception.
“Most people don’t know what 
to say,” Correll said. “What do you say?”
The contest, sponsored by Ka-
plan as a way to give back to its undergraduates, has been going on for 10 years, said Jeff Thomas, Kaplan director of graduate pro-grams. 
One name gets selected in the 
random drawing. 
The money comes from profits 
made by Kaplan classes and text-
books the company sells.
Thomas said one reason the 
company has the contest is to in-
terest students in taking higher education classes such as getting a master’s or law degree. 
However, he said none of the 
winners are obligated to go to graduate school after they win. 
Many do choose to go to gradu-
ate school, and others choose to join the workforce. Correll said he plans to get his master’s after he gets his bachelor’s degree in elec-trical engineering.
Correll, who felt relief when he 
won the sweepstakes, already used the winnings to pay off the $10,000 
credit card debt he incurred through 
his life change from full-time elec-trician to full-time student. 
Part of the debt came from a 
$4,000 renovation he had to make to his Jacksonville condo in order to rent it out so he could move to Gainesville.
Correll said the rest of the mon-
ey will go into a savings account to help him pay off his student loans and help pay for graduate school. 
He said before he won the mon-
ey, he and his wife were barely able 
to get by.
However, Correll will use the 
money for a few fun things. He 
hopes to make a big purchase soon: a $500 Cannondale road bike, a used one in good condition.
“My biggest pet peeve is having 
to wait an hour for the bus,” Cor -
rell said.
He also hopes he and his wife of 
two years, Trissillian Correll, will be able to travel, either at the begin-
ning of Summer or this December.
When Correll does begin to start 
studying for graduate school, he 
said he would use Kaplan to help him prepare for the GRE.

if I didn’t use them,” he said.
Correll said he has gotten lucky 
in the past before like with winning 
the bike in elementary school. Usu-
ally he doesn’t win things, he said.
However, Correll did get the 
internship he was waiting to hear from on the day he got the call from Kaplan.
He said quitting his job and go-
ing back to school was a gamble.
“All those choices that were iffy 
paid off,” Correll said.

one who will major in African American studies?Today’s question: Do you think gun laws should be 
stricter?Women in UFC are kicking major butt
Ladies and gentlemen, step right this way to an event 
that can both knock your teeth out and knock your socks off. I’m talking the real grit: the ﬁ  rst women’s 
mixed martial arts match ever for the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
This ain’t your bikini mud wrestling or lingerie league, 
folks. Mixed martial arts was once called “human cockﬁ  ght-ing” for a reason. The Ultimate Fighting Championship is full of ﬁ  ghts that leave prized ﬁ  ghters broken, unconscious or bloody, but that has never stopped people from paying to see it.
Stepping into the arena we have Liz Carmouche, a former 
Marine and Iraq War veteran who takes down her opponents with a vicious rear choke. She is up to give Ronda Rousey, 
the touted industry favorite, a run for her money. Rousey is 
an Olympic bronze medalist in judo who has reigned unde-feated since the start of her mixed martial arts days.
With a face that could break men’s hearts and a signa-
ture armbar that can break their backs, Rousey has put the Ultimate Fighting Championship into a media frenzy as it calls her the ﬁ  rst female Ultimate Fighting Championship superstar.
So, here is the part that turns this match from a public-
ity gimmick into a regular event for the Ultimate Fighting Championship: Would you pay to see it?
So far, the consensus seems to be yes. Rousey against 
Carmouche packed a full house, and the sports reporters all seemed to agree it was a good ﬁ  ght that lived up to the pub-licity hype.
The real unsung hero out of this entire event, other than the 
ﬁ  ghters, is Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fight-ing Championship. White once famously said there would 
never be a women’s mixed martial arts match allowed in the 
Ultimate Fighting Championship, but the story goes that all of that changed once he met Ronda Rousey.
With a rock-solid conﬁ  dence in Rousey as a ﬁ  ghter, White 
then promoted the ﬁ  rst women’s Ultimate Fighting Cham-pionship title match and watched as his golden girl put Car-mouche into an armbar hold until she tapped out.
All of this sounds like a Lifetime story about how some corporate mega-lord had a change of heart and helped lead a histori-cal change to a brutally competi-tive sport, but really , it was a story about money, and that just makes 
it better.
White’s opposition to a wom-
en’s Ultimate Fighting Champi-
onship ﬁ  ght wasn’t based on mi-sogyny but on proﬁ  t. He simply 
didn’t believe anyone would pay to see two women ﬁ  ght. But with the rise of women mixed martial arts ﬁ  ghters in the 2000s, White understood this was a cash cow that couldn’t be ignored.
Despite his bold claims that women would never ﬁ  ght in 
the cage, White was negotiating years ago to bring ﬁ  ghter Gina Carano into the Ultimate Fighting Championship, but it never panned out. White saw you need more than just one superstar to make something like a women’s division legitimate, so I think he has been biding his time until more women mixed martial arts ﬁ  ghters were ﬁ  erce competitors until he unleashed a full women’s title match to the Ultimate Fighting Championship audiences.
White then publicly announced his “change of heart” 
to the media in order to generate publicity and more ticket sales for the upcoming Rousey against Carmouche ﬁ  ght. He promoted the ﬁ  ght as the main title ﬁ  ght, and fans were welcome to pay an arm and a leg on pay-per-view to watch “history being made.”
Some might call White an opportunist looking to make a 
buck, but, to be honest, thank God he played it the way he did. If women’s matches in the big league are a step forward 
for women in mixed martial arts and people will also pay to 
see it, then that alone will push forward its acceptance all that much faster.
At the end of the day, we see two types of people that the 
world can’t live without: businessmen willing to take a risk and women ready to step up to a ﬁ  ght.

Jog Hog: 
Amazing 101-year-
old runner retires
It’s the week before Spring Break. Feeling a little down? Or 
stressed? Are you nervous or excited about the rest of the se-mester?
Let’s slow things down with a little inspiration to keep you 
truckin’ along. The world’s oldest marathon runner retired. He 
turns 102 years old April 1.
“I fear that when I stop running, people will no longer love 
me,” said Fauja Singh, who is nicknamed the “Turbaned Tor-
nado,” according to the Malaysian Insider. “At the moment, ev-eryone loves me... I hope nobody will forget or ignore me. When you become old, you become like a child and you want the at-tention.”
He started running when he was 89. Why?The Associated Press explained he started running as a “way 
to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick suc-cession in India,” and the death of his son in 1994 “took a par-ticularly hard toll on Singh because of its grisly nature. Singh and his son, Kuldip, both farmers, were checking on their ﬁ  elds in the middle of a storm when a piece of corrugated metal blown by the wind decapitated Kuldip in front of his father’s eyes.”
The rest of his children have since moved away from their 
home, so he decided to move in with his youngest son, who lives in London. That’s where he found other Sikh marathon 
runners.
Can you imagine being in his position? He was deﬁ  nitely in 
the twilight of his life when he decided to run his way out of 
depression instead of completely giving up.
“‘From a tragedy has come a lot of success and happiness,’ 
Singh said before the race as he explained how running has changed his life, allowing an illiterate farmer to travel the world, meet dignitaries and stay in ﬁ  ve-star hotels,” according to the report by the AP .
His story is incredible, and there are countless lessons we can 
learn from it.
Singh certainly sounds like one of the most positive and 
strong people alive on this planet right now. He has overcome an immense mental and emotional hurdle to ﬁ  nd a way to thrive.
How do you do that? How do you pick yourself up and keep 
going? How can you strive to ﬁ  nd the bright side of things and push through the terrible times?
Singh is amazing and handles situations with a level head on 
his shoulders.
“The reason for my good health is that I exercise daily and 
follow a proper diet regime,” he said, according to the New York Daily News. “I take happiness in biggest proportions though my actual diet is very small.”
His mental health is probably directly connected to his physi-
cal health. If you’re eating healthy and exercising at least a little, then odds are you’ll be doing better in the brain department, too.
We can’t forget there are millions of people who are going 
through tougher times than we are.
There’s no need to compare personal problems to those 
around the world, but maybe we can turn to Singh’s story when we need a pick-me-up.

If you’re a person who enjoys having a slice of cold pizza 
for breakfast, Satchel’s Pizza isn’t for you. No doggie bag necessary.
 Satchel’s Pizza, established by Steve “Satchel” Raye in 
2003, begins its day building beautiful pizza pies for hungry 
hipster customers at 7 a.m. when the dough is made, said 
day manager Jim McRae.  
 This unique pizza place greets customers upon arrival 
with clinking chimes blowing in the breeze, eclectic and vi-
brant colors of geometrical stained glass window panes, and the fragrant smell of sweet dough and pizza sauce.  Even the walls are covered by local artists’ best pieces of the month.
 Despite all the competition, the real art is scattered all 
over the menu: the pizza. Every order, each individual slice, 
is made to perfection and by no miracle, either. Satchel’s Piz-
za understands the value of consistency in culinary art.
 “It’s about training the kitchen staff to do things perfectly. 
The first hardest thing to do is the crust. The second hardest 
is the sauce. We figure out how to bake, prep and press, and we figure out consistency ,” McRae said.  
 The produce choices are tenfold, 
but for my little slice of heaven, ap-
propriately brought out to my table 
to “You Are My Sunshine” playing 
softly in the background, I chose to order the Mama, which comes with 
four toppings of the customer’s choice.  
 For me, it was artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach 
and mushrooms. With fresh and almost always local pro-
duce bought from Rainbow Produce just down the road from the restaurant, Satchel’s Pizza strives to give back to the community, said McRae, which is exactly what happens 
when my plate of art is sat on the table.
 The single slice of an 18-inch pie comes layered in ten-
derly warmed vegetables with mozzarella cheese that holds 
together as it’s pulled apart like wistful lovers.  
 Cut into a symmetrical triangle — isosceles for the math-
letes out there — the piece is colored with that of clear intent 
to make it as pleasing to the eye as possible.  The spinach is spread on top of the cheese like a cool bed with green satin sheets, followed by mushrooms, the light lime artichokes 
and the pop of red provided by the sun-dried tomatoes.
 Steam comes off the edge of the pizza with each bite.  
Luckily, the space between the pointy tip that is eagerly bit-
ten first and the line of the crust seems miles from my nose.
 The crust hits my tongue with a zap of salt, followed by 
the sweetness of the wheat dough that is crunchy at first but 
opens up to a fluffy inside.
 Mark Rodriguez, a member of the kitchen staff, said 
this pizza, like thousands of others before it, has been put 
through a three-day process, which includes 10 to 20 min-
utes of dough-making followed by two days of proofing, or letting the dough rise. The dough is then stretched, sauced and cheesed, and cooked for six minutes. On the toppings go and back in the oven for seven more minutes, he said.
 “I definitely think about looks,” Rodriguez said. “You 
don’t just want to plop the toppings on there all sloppy.”
 Once my slice had been buttered, it was sent out to me for 
the real test. Although people eat pizza every day via a deliv-
ery brand or, I daresay , maybe DiGiorno, Satchel’s Pizza is 
an experience. One slice is like a garden grown on the sweet-est smelling, golden-brown soil.
 Once the pizza is under your nose and no longer seen by 
your eyes, you discover the texture of the combination of 
vegetables and crust. 
 The vegetables are well-cooked but not overcooked, an 
admirable feat, considering the pizza serves as their only 
heating pan. As a whole, the elements of the piece of the 
pie work together to impress any picky palate and, as any 
good restaurant sporting Italian food should, bring together a community of pizza lovers.
 “We try to be a sustainable sort of restaurant, use recy-
clable materials — buy all local as much as possible to give 
back to the community without driving prices,” McRae said.  “It’s a family feel more than anything, a different atmosphere in the sense that it’s a local place and not a chain — I think that’s important.”
 But to the food lovers we all are, the important thing is the 
value of a great slice of pizza that is treated like a real work of 
art.  And my slice of Satchel’s pizza was a masterpiece.

Speaking OutWe are at the end of an era of compromise and 
complacency. 
We have no more time for armchair activ-
ists and social media pundits.
We do not live in a post-racial society. One black man elected to our highest office does not 
negate the fact that black and brown youth are in a 
state of emergency. 
Children are our society’s canaries in a mine. 
It’s time to stop pretending our canaries aren’t dy-
ing. 
It’s time for us to make decisions about our own 
lives. We’ve decided that we have worth.
On Feb. 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin was killed by 
George Zimmerman on his way home from a conve-nience store in Sanford, Fla.
Trayvon, a 17 year-old boy, was seen as inherently 
dangerous: a criminal, a second-class citizen by virtue of being black. 
He was ultimately shot for being somewhere Zim-
merman deemed inappropriate.
In 1955, two men also decided a black child’s life 
held no value.
Emmett Till, a 14-year-old, was dragged out of his 
home, taken to a barn, shot in the head and mutilated 
until unrecognizable because he stepped out of  “his” 
place.
In 1787 — 226 years ago — at the Constitutional 
Convention, our Founding Fathers formally decided the life of a black person was not equivalent to that of 
a white person in America. 
In fact, our Constitution claimed that we, who were 
already enslaved and abused, were three-fifths of a 
white whole and called it a compromise. 
Surely not a compromise we agreed on!The founders of this nation set a precedent, one that 
continuously manifests itself in our society. 
So much so that on Feb. 26, when Zimmerman de-
cided to shoot and kill Trayvon as he walked home, Florida was all but ready to send Zimmerman on his 
way.
As a result, we began to awaken and gain a new 
consciousness. 
We took to the streets. We protested. 
And for a short period of time, we stood together, 
and we decided this was not justice.
Out of this turmoil arose the Dream Defenders, and 
we’ve been building ever since. 
We’ve been building because we are living in a state 
of emergency.
Look at our public schools, for example.
What was once a visit to the principal or counsel-
or’s office in our parents’ day is now a degrading ride in the back of a police car.
Shoving in hallways (bat-
tery), taking something from a classmate’s book bag (theft or 
robbery) or being a class clown (disorderly conduct) 
are all grounds for arrest in Florida schools.
In Alachua County, where black students make up 
about 32 percent of the student population, they ac-count for 76 percent of school-based arrests, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Black students are about two to three times more 
likely to be suspended, expelled or arrested than white 
students for the same kind of conduct. 
It’s not because black kids behave worse than other 
students.
You would think after 226 years, black youth would 
stop being unfairly treated like criminals and second-
class citizens.
As Malcolm X said, “The young generation don’t 
want to hear anything about ‘the odds are against us.’ What do we care about odds?”
We have decided we are ignoring precedent. We’ve decided we are whole. We will no longer be second-class citizens in the 
country that was built on our backs.
It’s time we remember how we felt a year ago to-
day. It’s time we remember how we felt when voter suppression laws swept this state. 
It is time we remember no human is illegal. It is time we stand our ground and demand our 
kids be taught rather than dismissed and senselessly killed. 
It is time we stop reacting and start building: no 
more Trayvon Martins, no more Jordan Davises, no 
more Rodrigo Diazes and no more Emmett Tills.
So, we welcome you to the Dream Era; it’s only just 
begun.
Join us on March 5, the first day of the legislative 
session, on the steps of the Old Capitol of Florida, where we will deliver the real State of the State ad-
dress.
The Dream Era is an era that will be propelled by 
black and brown youth who spent their formative 
years criminalized, marginalized, tossed aside and 
forgotten.
We’ve found beauty in the dark; we found strength 
in our struggle and determination through despair. 
Now, we’re ready to set new precedents.

Eager improvisational comedy fans and 
supportive families gathered last week 
for the eighth annual Gainesville Improv 
Festival.
From Wednesday to Saturday, the 
festival celebrated improvisational and 
sketch theater, featuring 24 groups from 
Florida and across the country.
The groups performed pure 
improvisation, scripted comedy and 
musical comedy acts.
The festival also included a series of 
educational workshops for attendees featuring comedy instructors from across the U.S.
The festival held performances at 
High Dive, 210 SW Second Ave., and the Squitieri Studio Theatre, located inside the 
UF’s Phillips Center for the Performing 
Arts.
The four-day festival featured two shows 
per night with three acts performing.
And to make sure local flavor was 
present, each show featured a North 
Florida improv comedy group.
The Shock T’s, a musical comedy group from Chicago, made their Gainesville 
debut Saturday night, performing in a nearly sold-out show at the Squitieri Studio Theatre.During the performance, the group 
performed original songs. 
In one song, they sang about people not 
enjoying William Shakespeare’s literature.The group consists of Sarah Shockey, 
Tyler Paterson and Tim Dunn.
Shockey, 25, said she met Paterson, 
29, and Dunn, 28, while taking classes at 
the Second City, a comedy theater and 
improvisation school located in Chicago.
Shockey said one way the group creates 
new material is by continuously bouncing ideas off each other.
“It’s all a collaborative effort,” she 
said. “It’s like quilting little, fun ideas together.”
The festival also featured a performance 
from UF’s own Theatre Strike Force.
Adriana Robles, a 19-year-old UF 
telecommunication sophomore and a second-year Theatre Strike Force member, said she was excited to perform with her 
group in front of some of her comedic 
heroes.
At the same time, she said, it was a 
challenging experience.
Robles added that she credits the 
festival’s success to the support among comedy groups within the improv community.
“We all tell each other we have each 
other’s back,” she said.  “Everyone’s got your back.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2013

Gainesville city election can-
didates discussed transportation 
needs, the closing of a former jail and building renovations during a forum Saturday afternoon.
The Alachua County League 
of Women Voters hosted the third candidate forum of the 2013 Gainesville city elections at the First United Methodist Church, lo-cated at 419 NE First St. About 65 
people attended the event.
The forum began with the may-
oral debate and was attended by 
all six candidates: former commis -
sioners Ed Braddy and Scherwin L. Henry, former Gainesville-Alachua County Regional Airport Author -
ity board member Pete Johnson, incumbent Craig Lowe, Donald E. 
Shepherd Sr. and Mark Venzke.
Candidates talked about the 
city’s plan to turn the former Gainesville Correctional Institu-
tion into a homeless center.
Henry said he supported the 
plan.
“This would be an asset to not 
only the eastern part of the city, but the city and county as a whole,” he said.
Shepherd agreed, saying the 
purchase would be “one more step toward our city growing to be a better city.”
Candidates also talked about 
the city’s Vision 2020 Master Plan, which is a $50 million initiative to improve city parks.
Johnson said the plan was “am-
bitious” and was concerned if the 
city could afford it.  
Braddy was against the plan.
“We don’t need to build the Taj 
Mahal of parks,” he said.
On the topic of transportation 
needs, candidates discussed their positions on a new funding initia-tive to fix roads in the city.
Lowe supported new funding 
and said adding a bus rapid transit system is important.
“We need to have a future-ori-ented view on transportation,” he said
Venzke agreed, saying he saw a 
need for new, safer bikeways.
Braddy, however, was also 
against bringing a bus rapid transit system to Gainesville.
“The dynamics simply do not 
work here,” he said.
The forum also featured the 
City Commission District 4 debate. W.E. “Mac” McEachern, 20-year-
old UF building construction ju-
nior Alfredo Espinosa and incum-bent Randy Wells all attended.City candidates talk transportation, park plan during forum

Mike Foley will lead the free event 
in an interview format. Foley, a mas-

nalism. Following the program, at-tendees will be able to ask questions.
“I think a young journalist or 
someone wondering about journal-ism could certainly use his insight into the business, both then and now,” Foley said.
About 150 people are expected 
to attend, said spokeswoman Shelby Taylor.
UF student Leila Milgrim said she’s excited to hear Raines speak.
“I’m excited to gain insight about 
the business from such an estab-lished guy who has had such a great career,” the 21-year-old journalism senior said.
Raines began his career at The 
New York Times in 1978 as a nation-

based in Atlanta. 
He held several positions for the publication over the years, ending as executive editor in 
May 2003, when he was dismissed be-cause of the Jayson 
Blair scandal.

Gainesville Mayor Craig 
Lowe announced plans to pres-
ent a resolution supporting gun safety to the City Commission during a demonstration on Bo Diddley Community Plaza on Saturday.
The demonstration was 
held to urge Rep. Ted Yoho, of Gainesville, to support laws to reduce gun violence.
Lowe said Gainesville can 
advocate to federal and state legislatures to approve regula-tion that includes the removal of loopholes in background 
checks and limits on magazine 
capacity.
“Gun violence is a serious 
problem in our country ,” he said. “I think we need a com-prehensive approach to that problem that includes a regula-tion of firearms.”
The demonstration was or -ganized by Karen Epple, the MoveOn.org Gainesville coun-cil coordinator.  
Epple, 59, said both Yoho 
and Sen. Bill Nelson will be voting on bills regarding gun 
violence, and she wanted them 
to know their constituents want gun control.
“Every day , 270 people in 
the United States are shot in murders, assaults, suicides and police interventions,” she said.
More than 30 people attend-
ed Saturday’s demonstration. Attendees had the option to wear name tags with the num-ber of individuals they know who have been affected by gun violence. Epple wore the num-ber three.
“My sister and my mother 
both were held at gunpoint by men who supposedly loved them,” she said. “My brother was a police officer, and several times he had people try to shoot him.”
Alachua County School 
Board chair Eileen Roy was one 
of the speakers at the event.
“We can’t stand idle and not 
do anything when 20 kids are 
killed,” she said. “Everybody is worried about the schools, and I’m responsible for the schools.”  
Also present was a imper -
sonator acting as Abraham 
Lincoln, who Epple said was a 
victim of gun violence.
Although impersonator 
Lew Welge, 57, was not wear -
ing a name tag with a number, he said his alcoholic father once held him and his mother at gunpoint.
“If we had looked the wrong 
way or made a snide remark, my mother and I might both be dead,” he said.  
Attendees had the opportu-
nity to sign petitions support-ing actions to reduce gun vio-lence. The event ended with a candlelight vigil for victims.Mayor shies from the big guns

A Florida Forest Service helicopter drops small chemical-filled spheres that resemble ping pong 
balls over Paynes Prairie on Friday. The prescribed burn was aimed at ridding extra vegetation and combating the spread of hardwood trees.

A helicopter streaked through 
the Friday morning sky, dropping 
tiny spheres that ignited dry brush and sent plumes of smoke into the air.
It wasn’t doomsday but an aerial 
ignition-controlled burn at Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park.
The burn was part of a partner -
ship between the Florida Forest Ser -
vice and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.
Normally, prescribed burns are 
done by a ground crew who walks 
through the area using personal 
flamethrowers.
Friday’s aerial ignition burn, 
however, used a helicopter to burn areas unavailable to ground crews, said David Jowers, park manager of Paynes Prairie.
“You can burn larger parcels of 
property in a shorter period of time 
and get all the smoke up and out of 
the area and safely accomplish the goal,” he said.
The burn had been planned nine 
different times this winter, but be-cause of weather conditions, it had to be called off, Jowers said.On Friday, however, weather 
conditions were ideal for the burn.
About 15 volunteers donned in 
fire-retardant gear walked through the prairie, lighting ground fires in several spots of the 750-acre burn zone.
Meanwhile, a helicopter flew 
over the burn zone, dropping small chemical-filled spheres that ignited 
when they hit the ground.
Amber Roux, a Paynes Prairie 
park specialist, said the spheres, 
which resemble ping pong balls, are filled with flammable chemi-cals.
“At the time that they’re dis-
pensed, they’re injected with an-other chemical that causes a chemi-
cal reaction,” she said. “It’s delayed 
enough to get the sphere off the helicopter and hopefully to the ground as it’s combusting.”
Roux said Friday’s burn was 
aimed at ridding the prairie of extra vegetation that could be hazardous in a wildfire situation. The burn also aimed at combating the spread 
of invasive hardwood trees.
“[The burn] helps promote the 
kind of wildlife habitat necessary 
for the wildlife in this ecosystem,” she said.Officials light dry Paynes Prairie brush on fire — on purpose

Bob V otruba was watching TV in 
Cleveland when the 2007 Virginia 
Tech shootings became breaking news. As the father of three then-college-aged children, he wondered 
about how he could counteract the 
gunman’s actions.
So, V otruba founded One Million 
Acts of Kindness. And on Friday , nearly six years later, his Kindness Bus was parked on Buckman Drive to spread messages of peace to UF students.
“Being a dad — that’s what got 
me into this,” Votruba said.
UF was one stop on his 9,000-mile 
bus tour to raise awareness about bullying and adolescent suicide. The tour began in October and will go around the nation before ending with a 1,300-mile bike ride in New York City.
On Friday , 57-year-old V otruba 
walked around UF’s campus with 
his 5-year-old Boston terrier, Bogart, 
asking students to do small acts of kindness like holding a door open for someone or saying thank you.
“There will be lives saved be-
cause of this ride,” he said.
V otruba said 
when students 
walked by the bus, they usually gave V otruba a thumbs-up or stopped to pet Bogart.
“A lot of kids 
remember some-
one who was bullied,” he said.
UF journalism freshman Car -
men Kelly walked by the bus Friday and noticed its message of love and peace toward children.
“I like seeing that kind of stuff 
around campus,” the 19-year-old said.
V otruba visited campus in March 
2010. He proudly carries around a picture of Bogart posing next to the Bull Gator.
V otruba called One Million Acts 
of Kindness his individual lifetime goal. He has been invited to the White House by Lynn Rosenthal, the advisor on violence against women, and has been featured on the Oprah 
Network and CNN.
V otruba drives his bus with 
Bogart to each destination and then bikes around the city spreading 
his message. His school bus has an 87-square-foot living space with a kennel for Bogart and some storage room.
V otruba said his living expenses 
are mostly from his own savings with a few donations.
He said his main message is to 
have a goal of kindness and get in-volved in a charity. He said humans should treat each other without judgement and with respect.
“We should all be like dogs,” he 
said.

The first time the food trucks rolled 
to a stop and raised up their windows 
on the High Dive parking lot in January , they sold out of food in hours.
On March 16, Gainesville’s Food 
Truck Rally will return, and after careful planning, rally organizers and food ven-dors say they will be better prepared.
The next event will include more 
space for trucks and a 5 p.m. starting time for attendees, said Pat Lavery, an independent promoter for Glory Days Presents!
“We did a lot of brainstorming and 
noticed what could be improved,” Lav-ery said. “We’re trying for everyone to have more inventory , so they can serve longer and have the trucks better staffed and prepared to be able to move the lines faster.”
The rally will be again hosted by Glo-
ry Days Presents! and the Pelican Broth-
ers Food Truck. To reduce wait times, 
Lavery said admission to the event and concerts will be free.
“We’re hoping people will come eat, 
enjoy the concert and then come out and eat again,” he said.
Jason Howey , the 37-year-old owner 
of the Grilled Cheese Wagon, participat-ed in the January rally. He said he and 
the other vendors were surprised at the 
response from the community.
“I’ve never participated in anything 
like that before,” he said. “It’s an inter -
esting dynamic.”
This time, however, Howey said he 
will be more prepared by bringing a big-ger staff and additional equipment.
“We’ll definitely be bringing the sec-
ond griddle this time,” he said. “That should ensure we can move more items from the griddle to the people and do it faster.”Food Truck Rally to return SARAH FRICK

An inflatable jousting ring, a slam dunk 
trampoline and Florida’s only traveling zip 
line were enjoyed by about 500 attendees at UF’s Family Weekend Spring Edition 2013: Always Orange, Forever Blue.
The Division of Student Affairs and the 
Dean of Students Office hosted the first Spring family weekend Friday through Sunday. Any undergraduate or graduate students’ family members were welcome to attend.
Dean of Students Jen Day Shaw said she 
hopes attendees experienced family bond-ing, fun and fellowship with other Gator families and university employees.
Students and their family members also 
took advantage of free admittance to Gator 
Nights, as well as reduced tickets to Gator 
athletic events, including basketball, la-crosse, gymnastics, baseball and tennis.
Dan Fox, Spring Family Weekend pro-
gram chair and Campus Diplomat, worked with the New Student and Family Programs division of the Dean of Students Office to ensure Family Weekend happened accord-ing to plan. He said he enjoyed providing 
a platform on which students and families 
could bond together over exciting activities.
“We here at the University of Florida 
care a lot about our students and want them to have the best possible experience while here at the university,” said the 19-year-old marketing sophomore, “and by holding this Family Weekend, it is just another reason for a UF student to appreciate his university 
and be proud to be a Florida Gator.”
Yesenia Gomez, a student Preview co-
ordinator, said students are so busy that 
it’s nice for them to be able to relax for one weekend. She assisted Family Weekend by running check-in Friday afternoon.
The 21-year-old psychology junior said 
she hopes this was the first of many more 
successful Spring family weekends for UF’s 
campus.UF Family Weekend successful

� UF WAS SWEPT FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SINCE 2009.

Florida had a chance to sal-
vage a bad weekend against Flor -
ida Gulf Coast. 
Second baseman Casey Tur -
geon led off the bottom of the 
10th inning with a single and advanced to third on a pickoff at-
tempt that went into right field. 
With Turgeon 90 feet from home, Eagles pitcher Harrison Cooney intentionally walked Zack Pow-ers and Justin Shafer to load the 
bases with no outs.
After two flyouts to center and 
a fielder’s choice, Cooney got out of the inning unscathed.
“Swings got too big,” coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We got 
to stay short to the ball and just 
hit a fly ball. Just give us a chance 
to score a run. It’s as simple as that.”
The 17th-ranked Gators (3-
5) left a season-high 11 runners 
on base as they fell to the Eagles 
7-4 on Sunday at McKethan Sta-dium. 
Florida lost 8-2 on Friday and 
8-3 on Saturday.
The series marked the first 
time UF has been swept since los-
ing a weekend series at Arkansas in 2009.
The Eagles took advantage of 
the Gators’ squandered opportu-
nity, capitalizing in the top of the 11th.
In his third inning of relief, 
Shafer retired the leadoff batter 
before giving up a single to Bran-
don Bednar and walking pinch hitter Tyler Selesky. Left fielder Sean Dwyer then sent the first 
pitch he saw over the right field 
scoreboard.
“I was going to sit off-speed.” 
Dwyer said of his plate approach against Shafer. 
“They had been working away 
all day. Luckily, he left something up. (I) put a good swing on it.”
Freshman shortstop Richie 
Martin said Florida didn’t bounce back as it should have after fail-ing with the bases loaded in the 10th.
“It obviously took some of our 
tempo,” Martin said.
“We had to go back out on de-
fense and perform, but we didn’t do that. It’s put us in another 
hole.”
Sophomores Shafer and Pow-
ers led off the sixth inning with 
back-to-back singles.
After catcher Kevin Sty-
pulkowski advanced them with a bunt, designated hitter Taylor Gushue tied the game 2-2 on a Florida Gulf Coast completes sweep against Florida

Brianna Morgan let out a yell of re-
lief as she clinched the match point for a 
Florida victory.
The freshman battled through three 
lengthy sets to finalize a 4-2 win against 
Stanford on Sunday at Ring Tennis 
Complex.
Morgan previously struggled to 
maintain control with her serve, los-ing to Cardinal senior Stacey Tan, who closed up the two-point gap to 5-4.
But Morgan battled and found relief 
on the right side of Tan’s court just after the two went to deuce. 
“I feel like I blacked out,” Morgan 
said.  “All I saw was Lauren (Embree) running at me, and I was like, ‘Oh, I must have won.’” 
Morgan’s singles match was the lon-gest the freshman played this season, battling through more than 3 hours of tennis.
“It says a lot about an athlete, I think, 
to have the lead, lose the lead and then act like nothing happened,” coach Ro-
land Thornqvist said. “Clearly, she was 
really nervous, and to be able to handle the nerves like that shows that we’ve got some real potential to work with.”
The looming rain-
fall proved fortunate for the Gators. The match moved in-
doors during the last three singles match-
es, which resulted in two UF wins.
“We told [Thornqvist] that we 
wouldn’t be upset if we went indoors,” 
junior Alexandra Cercone said. “We’ve had experience practicing in there, and Stanford hasn’t, so we figured maybe Gators defeat Cardinal

The Gators’ wait is over.
After watching Auburn win the South-
eastern Conference championship 16 straight times, Florida finally finished on top.
The Gators captured the 2013 SEC Swim-
ming and Diving Championships after 11 straight second-place finishes, snapping the Tigers’ long reign on top.
UF won with a total of 1,408 points.“We have been chasing Auburn and nip-
ping at their heels every year and we’ve been close a couple of them,” coach Gregg Troy said in a release.
“This kind of takes us over the top from 
the standpoint that it gets the monkey off our back.”
Florida’s women finished third behind SEC champion Georgia and second-place Texas A&M. 
But the women did not leave College Sta-
tion, Texas, empty-handed. Senior Elizabeth Beisel earned the Commissioner’s Trophy as the high point winner for the second con-secutive year. 
Natalie Hinds was named SEC Female 
Freshman Swimmer of the Year.
“It’s a good building point towards the 
NCAA meet,” said Troy, who was named SEC Men’s Coach of the Year. “It’s not an end in itself, but it certainly is a good confer -
ence win.”UF men’s team knocks off

FLORIDA 4-3 ON SATURDAY.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Writer
 
Florida was scheduled to play 14 
innings in its doubleheader against 
Syracuse and No. 7 Missouri in the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic on 
Friday. The Gators and the Tigers 
nearly played 14 frames alone.
After winning its first 15 games, 
No. 5 Florida (16-1) fell to Missouri 
(9-1) 4-3 in 12 innings, setting the 
record for the longest game in UF 
history.
The Gators failed to take advan-
tage of numerous opportunities 
with runners in scoring position.After tying the game 2-2 in the 
fourth inning, Florida put a runner 
on second in two of the final three frames before extra innings. But Missouri pitcher Chelsea Thomas 
struck out three Gators with run-
ners in scoring position in the fifth 
and sixth innings to escape jams. Thomas notched 19 strikeouts in the game.
“She has a really good drop ball, and she’ll change it up,” freshman 
Kelsey Stewart said. 
The international tiebreaker 
rule took effect in extra innings, 
placing a runner at second to be-
gin each half inning. But it still 
took four frames before either side 
scored a run.
Hannah Rogers replaced Lauren 
Haeger after the fourth inning, and 
had one of her best performances 
of the season. Rogers tossed 7.2 
innings in relief, striking out nine batters.
Despite her strong pitching, she 
picked up the loss.
Both teams scored runs in the 
11th, setting the stage for the 12th inning.
The Gators nearly escaped the 
12th without any damage.
Catcher Aubree Munro caught 
the placed runner at third base on a failed squeeze bunt, but Rogers surrendered a double to Missouri junior Mackenzie Sykes and gave up consecutive singles to end the game.
“Hannah gave it her all, and 
we couldn’t have asked for any-
thing better,” Stewart said. “It just 
sucked that we put ourselves in 
that situation.”
But the weekend was not a total 
loss for Florida.
Following its defeat on Fri-
day, Florida played Georgia Tech (9-7) in its final game of the Palm Springs, Calif., tournament. Rog-ers again relieved Haeger early in 
the game, pitching four innings 
out of the bullpen. Florida’s offense was mostly 
dormant for the first five innings 
but came to life in the sixth inning after Bailey Castro singled, pitches hit Briana Little and Munro and se-nior Kelsey Horton walked.
Stewart came up with the bases 
loaded and cleared them with a three-run double, providing the difference in the Gators’ 5-3 win.
“I was just getting back to what 
I was doing the first weekend,” Stewart said, referring to her per -
formance at the Kajikawa Classic in Tempe, Ariz., which earned her Southeastern Conference Player of the Week honors.
On Thursday, Florida picked up 
wins against Loyola Marymount 
and Oklahoma State.
The first game saw a potent 
Gators offense score eight runs, 
including two homers. But the second game showcased Haeger in the circle. She fanned eight bat-ters en route to a complete-game shutout
The pitching was also strong in 
the Gators’ first game on Friday as Alyssa Bache started against Syra-cuse. Bache pitched a complete game, surrendering one run while matching a career-high nine strike-outs.
Despite suffering the first blem-
ish on their record this year, Stew-art said the weekend was positive for the Gators.
“Yeah, we lost,” Stewart said. 
“But there’s a lot of positive things to take from it. We have so much fight.”Sarah Davis / Alligator

Alabama has become a sight for sore eyes for Jaterra 
Bonds and Florida this season. But Sunday’s matchup 
hung in the balance longer than expected.  
For the second time in Southeastern Conference play, 
the Gators snapped an extended losing streak with a vic-tory against the Crimson Tide. Using a late second-half run, Florida upended Alabama 67-61 in Foster Audito-
rium.
The Gators beat the Crimson Tide 87-54 on Feb. 3 in 
the O’Connell Center to snap a five-game losing streak. 
Sunday’s win ended a three-game skid for UF. 
“This is a great sign of this team growing and matur -
ing and playing the way that we should play in the face of adversity,” coach Amanda Butler said. “They kept fighting and finding ways to make a difference. They handled the challenges that their coaches issued to them 
and made plays in critical, critical moments.”
Nothing proved more critical than Florida’s response 
to Alabama taking a 13-point lead with 10:36 remaining. 
Following a jumper by Jasmine Robinson, the Crim-
son Tide led 53-40. Florida responded with a 21-4 run during the next 6:26 to take a 61-57 lead.
Alabama (12-15, 2-12 SEC) never countered.
“We went out there and ran and played defense and 
did all of the small things that we took for granted in the 
beginning of the game,” sophomore Kayla Lewis said. 
“We just had to come out and play hard to dig out of that hole.”
Bonds led the Gators with 15 points on 6-of-8 shoot-
ing. The Crimson Tide has struggled to slow the junior 
guard, who scored 16 points on 4-of-6 shooting in UF’s 33-point blowout of Alabama earlier this season.
Bonds also grabbed six rebounds and collected four 
assists on Sunday. 
“She plays to win every time she steps on the floor,” 
Lewis said of Bonds. “But where she has grown as a 
player is picking her spots. They were giving her spots, and she was scoring. She took advantage of every op-
portunity there was for her to score.”
Lewis finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds for her 
third-career double-double. 
Neither team found any consistent offense in the first 
half. The two squads combined for 23 turnovers and just 23 made shots prior to halftime. 
Florida (16-12, 5-9 SEC) led 32-31 at the break despite 
exhibiting some of its sloppiest play of the season.
Junior guard Lily Svete scored all 11 of her points in 
the first half. She made her first three attempts from be-
hind the arc before missing her final five tries. 
Alabama opened the second half with an 8-0 run 
and used a 22-8 advantage during the first 9:24 to take a 13-point lead. But the Gators answered to avoid another 
crippling defeat.
“We had some players that we had been waiting on 
earlier in the game to come alive that came alive,” Butler 
said. “It was just a tremendous amount of fight.”
The victory was Florida’s first at Alabama since 2009. 
The Crimson Tide has dropped eight consecutive games to fall into a tie for last in the SEC with Ole Miss.
“[Alabama] plays hard in this gym,” Lewis said. 
“They took [Arkansas] to triple overtime. They play 
very well here. We had to be prepared for that, which we 
were, and came out with this win.”
A radio broadcast contributed to this reports.Contact Phillip Heilman at pheilman@alligator.org.
Missed opportunities result in Gators’ first loss of 2013Florida rallies to defeat Alabamarun-scoring single up the middle. 
The Gators went up 4-2 when 
Gushue scored on the first of Vick-
ash Ramjit’s two infield singles and 
an RBI groundout from center field-er Cody Dent.
The lead would not last. 
O’Sullivan attempted to get four innings out of reliever Johnny Ma-gliozzi, but the sophomore right-hander ran out of steam in the top of the seventh.
After retiring the first two bat-
ters on flyouts to the warning track, he gave up a single to Sean Dwyer and an opposite field two-run home run to Eagles’ first baseman Brooks 
Beisner, tying the game 4-4. Beisner finished the series 6 for 
12 with two home runs, two dou-
bles and six RBI.
“They hit great,” Cooney said of 
his teammates.
“Squaring a lot of balls up. 
When we (were) getting guys on, we were getting them over, getting them in.”
Florida was not able to do so, but 
Dent said the team will not panic because of the early struggles.
“It’s a long season,” Dent said.  
“It’s the beginning of the season we have to come out here and work hard. Focus on getting back on track for Tuesday and carry that into the weekend.”

For freshman Bridgette Caquatto, Friday 
night’s gymnastics meet was more than her 
college debut.No. 1 Florida’s 196.975-196.075 win 
against No. 23 Kentucky in the O’Connell 
Center was the first time Caquatto and her 
sister Mackenzie competed on the same team since they became elite gymnasts. 
“When I was in the elite world, she was 
always a senior when I was a junior, so I ac-tually never competed with her too much,” Bridgette said. “I’ve been looking forward 
to a day like this. I wish it would’ve gone a 
little better for our team and for both of us, but it was really exciting.”
Prior to Friday, Bridgette had only com-
peted for Florida in exhibition during Flor -
ida’s 197.65-196.025 win against Auburn on Jan. 25 and in Florida’s 197.575-196.175 vic-tory against Arkansas on Feb. 1. The fresh-man had been held to only exhibition action, 
because she was still rehabbing after under -
going shoulder 
surgery on May 31 to repair a 
partially torn 
rotator cuff. Coach Rhonda Faehn debated 
redshirting Bridgette earlier in the week, but she changed her mind before Friday’s meet.
“As a coaching staff, we all really decided 
that she needs the experience,” Faehn said. 
“She is capable of being a 9.9 on two events 
minimum. … It was just a decision that she 
really has the potential to be a very big con-tributor, and we wanted to be able to see her out there.”
Bridgette started her college career by 
performing on bars and floor Friday. How-ever, a miss on bars and out of bounds on floor resulted in a low 9.225 and 9.65, respec-tively. 
“It was not the night that I wanted to 
have, but I was thankful that they put me out there,” Bridgette said.
With Mackenzie and Bridgette both com-
peting on Friday, it was the first time the Gators had sisters in the lineup since Lynn and Karen McDonnell performed at the NCAA Championships on April 6, 1984. But 
that wasn’t the only change for UF.
For the first time since Feb. 18, 2011, Flor -
ida competed without an all-around com-

Even with the lineup change, the Gators 
got off to a strong start on vault and bars. 
Florida used four new personal bests in 
the first two rotations to give the Gators a 99.025-98 lead against the Wildcats. 
But two misses on beam from Bridget 
Sloan and Mackenzie led to a dismal 48.525, Florida’s lowest beam score this season. 
Still, the Gators regrouped in the final 
rotation. Jamie Shisler and Kiersten Wang used career-best performances on floor to 
help Florida earn its second-highest score on 
floor this season with a 49.425.
“The first two events were incredible and 
the last event was really wonderful with the 
way they pulled it together,” Faehn said. 
“Beam was very uncharacteristic for them. 
They’re a very strong beam team. … There 
were so many positive highlights (Friday). I don’t want the few mistakes to overshadow the really great moments that were there.”

Sophomore Shannon Gilroy 
wrapped up a long week and a 
half for the Gators with her name 
in the record books.
Gilroy scored five goals and 
recorded a record-breaking eight 
draw controls in No. 3 Florida’s 
17-7 win against UAlbany (0-1) on 
Sunday at Dizney Stadium. 
The Gators (6-0) beat the Great 
Danes 21-4 in draw controls.
“It carries a lot of momentum,” 
Gilroy said. “And when we have possession of the ball, the other team can’t score.”
Gilroy’s eight draw controls 
sets a program record. She fin-
ished the day with 104 for her ca-
reer.
“I just do my best when it 
comes to the draw,” Gilroy said. “I plan on going straight up in the 
air every single time, and I do my 
best to get it.”
Senior Brittany Dashiell is the 
all-time leader in draws for Flor -
ida with 156. Dashiell surpassed 
100 in 35 games. Gilroy only need-
ed 27.“She dominated the draw, 
that’s what she does,” coach 
Amanda O’Leary said of Gilroy’s 
play. “She’s not 
only a threat on 
the draw but of-fensively.”
In addition to 
dominating the 
draw, Gilroy led 
her team with five goals. She 
leads the Gators with 16 scores this season.
Senior Ashley Bruns accounted 
for four goals for the second time in three days. She is tied with se-nior Kitty Cullen, who had three 
on Sunday, for second on the team 
with 13 scores.
The Gators converted 17 of 
their 31 shots. Their shooting per -
centage measured more than .500 
for only the second time this sea-
son.
Since Florida’s season-open-
ing 5-3 win against North Caro-lina on Feb. 9, the Gators’ offense 
has opened up. They have aver -
aged 15.4 goals in their past five 
games.
“I credit [assistant Erica LaGrow] with putting together a 
really good offensive game plan,” 
O’Leary said. “Those players are 
really well prepared. Obviously, 
it’s up to them to execute, and 
they did.”
UF’s offensive spurt came 
in five games during an 11-day stretch.
“They never hung their heads 
and said, ‘Oh my gosh, five games in 11 days, that’s just overwhelm-
ing,’” O’Leary said.
“They lived up to it, they 
worked hard and came out with 
five victories.”Sophomore midfielder breaks school record in dominant win

that could be a one-up on 
them.”
Cercone’s was the first of the 
three singles matches to clinch match point for a 3-2 lead in-
doors.
The junior fell short in the 
first set against Stanford’s 10th-
ranked Krista Hardebeck, a 6-4 decision played outside.
Once Cercone went inside, 
she dominated Hardebeck, winning the second set 6-4 and clinching the third set 6-3 by 
spiking the ball to Hardebeck’s 
corner on serve.
“She’s just a master of ma-
nipulating pace,” Thornqvist said. “Under pressure, I think on one of [Hardebeck’s] sides, she broke down a little bit, and Alex did a really good job find-ing that time after time.”
Cercone’s victory helped the 
Gators end the back-and-forth tie on the scoreboard and over -
come the doubles loss.
During doubles, Florida tied 
scores on all courts early on, but Stanford snuffed out UF’s chances, clinching four points against the Gators on Court 1 and three points on Court 2 to claim the doubles point. 
Embree and Sofie Oyen 
could not overcome short slices 
in the frontcourt from Stan-
ford’s Kristie Ahn, who held serve advantage to win 8-4. 
However, Oyen battled 
back against Ahn and gave her a dose of her own game during singles. Oyen shut out Ahn in two sets with a 6-2, 6-2 result. 
Olivia Janowicz also battled 
back after losing on the doubles court, defeating Stanford’s Lindsey Kostas 6-2, 6-2. 
Freshman Danielle Collins 
was the only player to lose in doubles, falling to No. 33 Ellen 
Tsay 6-2, 6-2.
The Cardinal’s Nicole Gibbs 
challenged Embree all over the 
court, sending balls to both sides and giving her a run to frontcourt with choppy ground balls. The match went into a third set, but Morgan’s win ended play to give the Gators 
their victory early.
Thornqvist said the team did 
well at giving Stanford grueling 
matches, despite the back-and-forth battle on the scoreboard.
“It’s a team of warriors,” 
Thornqvist said.
Cercone added: “No matter 
what the score is, we’re going 
to be fighting ‘til the very end.” TenniS , from page 1316, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2013

The Gators’ frontcourt frus-
trated forward Marshawn Powell 
and the Razorbacks all Saturday 
night. 
As Powell received the ball on 
the left wing with 10:45 remaining 
in the first half, he drove down 
the baseline only to find junior 
forward Casey Prather standing outside the restricted area.
Powell committed his second 
foul of the night on the play. 
Both came on charges drawn by 
Prather. 
While Prather yelled in excite-
ment after the second charge, 
Powell shook his head at a refer -
ee and walked to the Razorbacks 
bench, where he stayed for the remainder of the first half.
“It was huge, because it got 
Powell in foul trouble,” point guard Scottie Wilbekin said.  “Obviously, without [Powell], they’re not as good of a team.”
Prather’s play was represen-
tative of how dominant Florida was in the paint offensively and defensively against Arkansas in its 71-54 win in the O’Connell 
Center. 
The Gators outscored the Ra-
zorbacks in the paint 42-18. On two-point attempts, UF shot 53.8 
percent.
In Florida’s first meeting with 
Arkansas — an 80-69 loss in Fay-
etteville, Ark., on Feb. 5 — the 
Razorbacks went 51.3 percent on shots inside the arc.
“We respected them more,” 
center Patric Young said.
“Last time, we didn’t respect them when we went to their place.
“We were probably a little 
complacent.”
Young led UF’s inside effort 
with 14 points on 7-of-10 shoot-ing. Coach Billy Donovan said 
Young did a better job demand-
ing the ball. 
“My daughter could have 
thrown the ball inside to him,” 
Donovan said.
“He was open. He made him-
self available. He wanted it. He 
had a presence.”
Prather grabbed a career-best 
nine rebounds to go along with eight points on 4-of-7 shooting. Forward Erik Murphy added 12 points and made 3 of his 4 two-
point field goal attempts.
Florida attacked the rim more 
frequently Saturday than during 
its 63-60 loss against Missouri on 
Tuesday.
The Gators attempted 61.1 per -
cent of their shots from behind the arc and lacked a post pres-
ence against the Tigers but took 37.1 percent from three-point range on Saturday.  
“We had to get the ball in the 
paint,” Murphy said.
“When we get the ball in the 
paint — whether it be on post-ups, drives — our offensive effi-
ciency is better.”Wilbekin added: “Coach 
(Donovan) just drilled that point to us.”
Powell scored seven of the Ra-
zorbacks’ first eight points, but 
the Gators held him scoreless for the remainder of the contest. 
In the first 3 minutes of the 
second half, Powell picked up two more fouls but still remained in the game. Young drew both 
fouls in the post. 
Aside from Coty Clarke, who 
scored 18 points on 8-of-8 shoot-
ing, Arkansas look rattled in the paint after Powell’s first-half de-
parture. 
Less than 2 minutes after 
Powell checked out of the game, 
Young swatted a jump shot from 
forward Jacorey Williams. About 
a minute later, Prather rejected guard Michael Qualls’ layup out of bounds. 
With guard Michael Frazier II 
out until Saturday’s game against Alabama after suffering a concus-sion midway through the second half against Arkansas, Florida 
will need to find balance on of-
fense like it did on Saturday.  
Donovan named freshmen 
DeVon Walker, Braxton Ogbueze and Dillon Graham as potential 
replacements for Frazier in Flor -
ida’s rotation against Tennessee 
on Tuesday.
“When we rely on threes, it 
goes good and bad,” Boynton said.
“(During) the Missouri game, 
we started out good in the three, but we relied on the three, and it 
hurt us in the end of the game. So 
we definitely have to get a pres-ence at the basket.”Increased inside presence keys win
“We had to get the ball in 
the paint. When we get the 
ball in the paint — whether 
it be on post-ups, drives — 
our offensive efficiency is 
better.”
