SPORTS 15NC farmer: 600 pounds of trout scooped from pond
CANTON, N.C. — A North Caro-
lina trout farmer thought something was 
fishy when one of her ponds wasn’t fishy enough.
The Asheville Citizen-Times reports 
Sunburst Trout Farm owner Sally Eason and her husband noticed Thursday that the pond had virtually no fish in it. 
Thieves had made off with 600 pounds 
of trout.Eason says the thieves baited the wa-
ter so the fish would come to the surface, scooped up the fish and got them into a getaway car. She says the farm had been locked, and there were no signs anyone broke in.
Eason says she told local fish markets 
to be on the lookout for anyone trying to unload a huge amount of fish.

FLORIDA 6 ALABAMA 31
� LOSS SNAPS UF’S 24-
GAME REGULAR SEASON WIN STREAK.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Urban 
Meyer didn’t want any “Southeast-
ern Conference Championship re-match” talk last week.
The Gators coach said his team 
was too young to worry about what happened in December, when Florida’s hopes of back-to-back na-tional championships were halted, crushed and stomped by Alabama. This week wasn’t about revenge. It was about potential win No. 5, he said.
If Meyer somehow succeeded in 
that goal, the accomplishment was offset the moment players walked on the field Saturday.
Entering to a chorus of boos from 
most of the 101,821 in attendance at Bryant-Denny Stadium, freshman receiver Andre Debose waved his arms to the Crimson Tide student 
section, begging the fans to make 
more noise.
And they did just that, erupting 
when a highlight video showed a clip of former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow getting tackled in last 
season’s meeting. Even Gators 
coaches were amped, hopping around on the sidelines.
But the pregame excitement was 
gone by the end of the first quarter, and the Gators were left with what they brought to Alabama: an inexpe-rienced team (42 percent of Florida’s roster are freshmen), a struggling of-fense and an untested defense.If last year’s game was embar -
rassing for Florida fans, this season’s 31-6 loss was depressing.
“No team is perfect,” linebacker 
Brandon Hicks said. “You can’t go through a perfect season without having some type of controversy , some type of obstacle in front of you. We felt like this is our point, this is where we actually hit reality.”The No. 14 Gators (4-1, 2-1 SEC) 
looked ready to go toe-to-toe with the defending national champions during their opening drive. Junior quarterback John Brantley ran past a 
Crimson Tide blitz for a first down, 
connected with receiver Deonte Thompson for 21 yards and flipped the ball to sophomore Omarius Hines on a 19-yard reverse.
But Florida’s offense stalled at 
the goal line. Freshman Trey Burton, whom Meyer insisted would not be used to emulate Tebow following 
his school-record six-touchdown 
performance against Kentucky, was stuffed on consecutive runs before getting intercepted by linebacker Nico Johnson on the Tebow-trade-marked jump pass.
“It was an aggressive call, some-
thing that we would probably do again,” Meyer said. “As a matter of 
fact, I know we would do it again.”
The Gators actually outgained 
the No. 1 Crimson Tide (5-0, 2-0 
SEC) 281-273 and controlled the ball longer, but those stats were trumped by turnovers and red-zone woes.
In their first four games, the 
Gators scored on 17 of 19 red-zone possessions, highlighted by 16 
touchdowns. But Florida managed 
just three points on four red-zone possessions, which included Bur -
ton’s interception, a fumbled snap and a turnover on downs.
“Florida beat Florida today ,” 
center Mike Pouncey said after the game. 
The Gators offense also turned Tide roll, Gators season at crossroads

Alabama running back Trent Richardson and the Crimson Tide were efficient, scoring 31 points on 273 
total yards. The Gators outgained the Crimson Tide but were plagued by turnovers.

City commissioners want you to know the 
face of homelessness doesn’t always belong to 
a bearded hitchhiker wearing a backpack. It 
can be the face of a child living out of a rela-
tive’s car. Sometimes it’s the face of a woman 
who lost her job.
“That’s a part of the homeless picture, but 
that’s not all of it,” said Alachua County Com-missioner Rodney Long at a press conference Friday afternoon. Long, joined by City Commissioner Jack 
Donovan and advocates for the homeless, gave a midway update on the progress made by the City of Gainesville/Alachua County 10-year plan to end homelessness, which was 
drafted in March 2005. 
The press conference, held at the County 
Administration Building, was the first in a 
10-day awareness campaign running through Sunday . 
Some of the progress listed included a 
completed joint Office of Homelessness, a FloridaWorks office inside the county’s Hous-ing Authority to help battle unemployment 
and a homeless manage-ment information system for agencies to share infor -
mation through.
“We are very pleased 
about the progress,” Long said, adding that there is 
still a long way to go to find help for the estimated 1,292 homeless in the Gainesville 
area. 
While a report from the Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry cites this as a 25 percent decrease in the overall homeless population, commissioners said the actual number may be double, as many home-less people do not participate in surveys. 
“They choose to be below the radar,” Long 
said.
Since 2005, the plan has been tailored to ad-
dress more needs as they’ve arisen, Donovan said. Several of the updates revolve around the first entry/one-stop center to be built

Models show off some of the costumes for sale at the Hippodrome Cos-
tume Show and Sale on Saturday at the Hippodrome State Theatre.
By JON SILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Between the two tall white pillars on the 
steps of the Hippodrome State Theatre on Satur -
day morning, models wearing bright green-and 
-pink wigs walked across the entrance to the the-
ater and posed in costumes.
The event, hosted by the venue as a fundrais-
er for future theater productions, was a silent 
auction of one-of-a-kind outfits made by two-
time Emmy-winning costume designer Marilyn 
A. Wall.
Patrons could also buy costumes from past 
productions in the basement sale after the fash-ion show. 
The event ran from noon to 5 p.m., but for 
a $20 voucher customers could get first dibs on the wares.
Wall, who now works as the costume design-
er at the theater, was wearing a purple tutu and flashing heart necklace. 
She said the recession has affected the arts, 
and productions are struggling to make ends meet.
“Last year this event made $15,000, but we 
had more costumes,” she said. “I don’t think we’ll make that much this year.”
She estimated that this year the fundraiser 
would raise $6,000 to $7,000.The silent auction generated little interest, so 
organizers slashed prices toward the end of the 
event.
Wall’s 16 costumes were themed — caped 
vixens, evil bridesmaids and a mother-daugh-
ter duo in matching pink capes showed off the styles.
Bernadette Ray was one of the models wear -
ing a Wall outfit. She was almost nude in a show-er curtain, sequin bra and plastic-bag skirt. 
The highest bidder for the outfit also got a 
free personal training session by Ray, a trainer who works at Zen Fitness in Gainesville.
Some of the more colorful items on sale in-
cluded a fake severed hand for $5, a vintage, 
gray military coat for $150 and a hat made out 
of a cardboard Coors Light box with a mullet at-tached to the back for $45.
About 500 people stopped in to check out the 
offerings, including partners Brandon Wight, 95, 
and Bruce Blackwell, 69.
The two men purchased leopard print, fuzzy 
leggings, which they plan to use for an upcom-
ing Halloween party.
“I plan on using these as arm sleeves,” Black-
well said. “We have these animal masks we’re going to wear that we got in Acapulco.”Caped vixens, evil bridesmaids

Indian students strutted their stuff 
across the stage in the O’Connell Cen-
ter Saturday night.
Gator Garba, hosted by the Indian 
Student Association, featured two In-dian dances, garba and dandiya raas, that celebrate Navratri, a Hindu festi-val of worship and dance. The word 
“navratri” means “nine nights” and 
represents a war between the Indian goddesses and demons.
“The celebration on the ninth night 
is the ending of the war where good triumphs over evil,” said Parita Patel, president of the association. “That’s why we dance. That’s why we cel-ebrate  – because of the war that we 
won.”
Speakers reverberated with modern 
music like “Dynamite” by Taio Cruz 
while members of the group danced on stage and on the floor in a garba-esque line featuring the Gator chomp.“Dandiya is more fast-paced. That’s 
what I like about it,” said Tarish Mehta, a 29-year-old UF graduate. 
He said he has attended Navratri 
celebrations for as long as he can re-member.
“It’s very colorful, lively , and it 
wakes you up. It’s a different feeling,” 
he said. “You’re in a different world.”
Gator Garba, funded by Student 
Government, cost more than $7,000 to 
put on this year. Admission was free 
for UF and Santa Fe College students and $5 for general public. 
About 800 people attended Garba 
this year, according to Patel. 
This year was Patel’s last Gator 
Garba. An event management senior, she said she has only happy memories of each of her four years planning the event.
“It’s a chance for us to celebrate and 
to show other people what we do and what we can do, and let them have fun 
with it,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2010

Pi Delta Psi Fraternity Inc. performs a skit about kung fu fighting on stage in the Rion Ballroom of the 
Reitz Union on Saturday night. The show was the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, a Chinese cultural festival 
that lasted all day Saturday.By LUKE GAVIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students scarfed down moon-
cakes and got a taste of Chinese 
culture Saturday night.
Students packed the Reitz 
Union Rion Ballroom for the 
Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, in 
observance of the traditional Chi-
nese holiday that celebrates the 
harvest and the moon.
Maggie Mei, president of the 
UF Chinese American Student 
Association, which hosted the 
festival, said this is one of the as-
sociation’s biggest shows of the 
year. 
“It’s a classical legend,” Mei 
said. “It’s like ‘The Wizard of Oz’ but in Chinese culture.”
The association planned and 
prepared for the festival for sev-
eral months, according to John 
San, special events coordinator 
for the association. 
He said more than 400 people 
attended.
The performance, called “Jour -ney to the East,”  mixed skits with 
singing, dancing and kung fu.
Dean Jaber, a member of the 
audience, said this was his first 
year involved with CASA and 
his first time at the Mid-Autumn 
Moon Festival.
“I was blown away by a lot 
of the performances, so the en-
ergy level was something that I 
wasn’t expecting,” Jaber said. “It 
definitely surprised me in a good way though.”
Siyang Lu, one of the show’s 
emcees, said one of the good 
things about CASA is the fact 
that it is not exclusively for Chi-nese or Asian students. 
“We really want to spread cul-
tural awareness,” Lu said. “That’s 
what this is about.”Students crowd ballroom for Chinese Moon Festival
�THEY WERE RESCUED FROM ABUSE.
By ERIN RAUCH
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office auc-
tioned four abused horses Saturday. 
The horses were seized from owner Shel-
ley Kay Dinsmore, 44, of La Crosse, on Aug. 
18 according to an article in the Gainesville Sun, after they were found without adequate food and water.
Sgt. Robert Behl of the Rural Services 
Unit said the pasture was mostly dirt, there was no natural vegetation and no running water.
“That’s not sufficient for horses,” he 
said.
Perry Koon, ASO’s rural services deputy, 
said he spent about six weeks working with the owner before filing for petition through a judge to get ownership of the horses.
Koon warned bidders that the horses 
were not in the best condition. One horse, nicknamed “Old Man” by the unit, was so thin his ribs were visible.
“Obviously if these horses weren’t mis-
treated they wouldn’t be here,” Koon, said.
Koon requested the minimum bid to start 
at $120 for each horse to recoup the cost of food and shelter. A UF veterinarian evalu-ated the horses for about $415.
The horses were kept at the Rural Ser -
vices Livestock Impound, a 30-acre pasture with a seven-stall barn and four-pen sorting area, in La Crosse.
Peter Gregory, 82, bought a 30-year-old 
dark bay gelding for $25 on Saturday.  He and his wife, Mary Gregory, founded the gelding’s new home, the Mill Creek Farm Retirement Home for Horses, in 1984.
The 265-acre farm in Alachua is home to 
about 129 horses. He said he retires horses that are at least 20 years old that have com-monly worked in public service.
“We let them roam around and enjoy life,” 
he said. “We let them live like a horse.”
Mickey Bath, a physician’s assistant at 
UF’s Student Health Care Center, and his wife, Tuyet Bath, bought a dark bay paint 
mare for $145 and a black and white gelding 
for $110. Both will live on the Baths’ 97-acre farm in Bradford County.
Mickey Bath said he’s not worried about 
the horses’ condition and hopes his grand-children can eventually ride them. He said he bought a second horse to keep the other company and didn’t have a reason for which horses he chose.
The final bid was on a paint mare, pur -
chased for $100.
“The point is to get the horses to a good 
home,” Koon said.Horses find homes at auction“We really want to spread 
cultural awareness. That’s 
what this is about.”

The one-stop homeless center should be completed next summer
about five miles north of downtown Gainesville near the 800 
block of Northwest 53rd Avenue.
The center will sleep 60 transitional residents and eight 
permanent residents who are either disabled physically or mentally , according to Theresa Lowe, director of the Office of 
Homelessness. 
Lowe said the center will cost about $4 million, which in-
cludes land acquisition and construction, and should be com-
pleted next summer.
About 500 meals will be served daily , and a campground 
outside the center will be able to hold about 100 members of the homeless community. To counter criticism of the center’s location, Donovan said a shuttle service is being considered to transport people from the downtown bus terminal to the 
center.
The commissioners said the center will not only help peo-ple get back on their feet but also provide residents with the 
skills and counseling necessary to remain self-sufficient. 
“Homeless people are just like everybody else. They need a 
whole range of services,” Lowe said.
A medical clinic was another update to the original plan, 
Donovan said.
“A huge percentage of homeless have mental-health is-
sues or substance-abuse problems or both,” said David For -
est, chairman of the campaign and a substance abuse therapist 
with Shands Vista’s Florida Recovery Center. 
Forest emphasized that medical expenses can be the cause of homelessness for many and said a case management pro-
gram is needed at the center. 
Through the program, case managers could work with the 
homeless through counseling and treatment, and even assist with simple tasks like applying for disability . 
A warrant-clearance program is being created for the home-
less, which would involve working with the Office of Home-lessness, the State Attorney’s Office and the public defender to get misdemeanor charges dismissed, Donovan said. 
“They may have some charges that are not for violent 
crimes, but they may prevent them from getting help,” Forest 
said.
For Lowe and Forest, the campaign’s ultimate goal is chang-
ing the community’s perception of the homeless. 
“Education is knowledge,” Lowe said. “The more you 
know, the less you have to be intimidated by.”

42% NOFriday’s question: Are you registered to vote in Alachua County?Today’s question: Did you stop watching the UF-Alabama game before it ended?The apparent source of all evil has been called out 
again by President Obama, and I’m not talking about the Georgia Bulldogs. 
Obama took time out of what one would think is a 
pretty busy schedule to bash Fox News Channel once again. 
The president told “Rolling Stone” in an interview he 
thought Fox’s viewpoint of opinionated media is “ulti-mately destructive for the long-term growth of a coun-try that has a vibrant middle class and is competitive in the world.” 
While many top Democrats and Obama supporters 
would love to say he’s opposed to biased media, it seems to me in reality he’s just biased against Fox News.
Essentially, the president wants us to think he’s say-
ing the tradition of opinionated media is a bad prec-
edent that needs to end. 
I am sure there are a lot of people out there who 
would agree with that thought. 
The problem is  the president isn’t trying to eradicate 
biased media.
If the president really had an issue with biased media 
why isn’t he calling out MSNBC, for example? 
That media outlet is just as biased as Fox. The differ -
ence is, for our commander in chief, it is biased in favor of the president.
Now, lets be serious. Of course Fox is biased. Of 
course its slogan of “fair and balanced” is a joke, but 
if MSNBC used that same slogan, it would be just as joke-worthy.
The president is falling into the game of party poli-
tics again, the very thing he has attempted to blame the Republicans for doing many times in his tenure as head of government. 
He has continually attempted to 
say that he wants to reach across 
party lines and work for the best 
interest of America. But this is just another example showing he is as one-sided as many of the other 
members of the political parties 
he’s chastised so often.
More importantly, should the head of the United 
States government really be calling out a news source for its bias?
Last time I checked, freedom of speech gave Fox the 
right to have whatever opinion it wants on its channel. 
It’s that same freedom that allows MSNBC to put on 
its own 24/7 liberal lovefest.
So why, when there are so many issues in this coun-
try right now, is our leader putting himself down on the same level as those he fights against? 
We have issues at home and abroad in this country 
and instead of working to make progress on them, the 
president is wasting time and making another major in-
cident out of a nonissue by calling out one of the largest media organizations in the nation.
It is the media’s job to inform their viewers in the 
way they best see fit.
And for anyone who thinks it is wrong for Fox to 
have such a conservative bias, then isn’t it just as bad for MSNBC to have such a strong liberal bias? 
Then again, the president might miss his personal 
advertising channel.

In a study that might not 
shock many, the majority of Americans apparently 
know very little about what they preach. 
A study released Tuesday 
by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life found, on aver -
age, atheists and agnostics know more about world reli-gions than do their Protestant and Catholic counterparts. 
Out of 32 questions rang-
ing from the name of the 
Islamic holy book (c’mon 
Gainesville, we know you know this one), the name of the first book in the Bible and the mechanics of that holy body and blood via bread and wine thing, atheists scored an average of 66 percent right.
And to say the highest 
passing score for any reli-gious group is a “D,” espe-cially when the top of the class doesn’t believe in a God, says a great deal about the preach-ers on Turlington who ad-monish everyone who walks by for generally exuding an un-Christ-like aroma. 
And to be fair, those down 
with the G-O-D and filled with Christ’s love on a week-
ly basis often performed bet-
ter on the study’s holier-than-thou pop quiz. 
The study pointed out 
that as one of the developed world’s most religious na-tions, with our adamant opposition to praying in school and our Oh-My-God-
We-Can’t-Have-Our-Kids-
Saying-’Under-God’-In-Our-Pledge-Of-Allegiance mantra, we notably lack in  knowl-edge of the age-old debate of religion.
Regardless of America’s 
apparent ignorance concern-ing anything to do with be-

us fear our world even more when we realize that the peo-ple telling us all we’re going to Hell for not taking their pamphlets might not have read them.Lame Legacy 
Social media defining 
our generation
Is our generation defining Facebook, or is it defining us?
Released Friday, “The Social Network” describes the 
genesis of what became an international phenomenon 
that birthed a new kind of information highway that made 
instant online news almost too slow.  
Facebook has redefined our culture. It has saturated pop 
culture with a vigor like almost nothing else has. It has forced us to reevaluate our standards of privacy and created a gen-eration in the making. 
The recently released movie begs the question, is our gen-
eration ready to be defined by nothing more than ambiguous 
status updates, untagged photos that await us somewhere in 
the depths of cyberspace and “25 things you probably didn’t 
know about me” virtual notes?
Are we complacent enough to define an entire generation 
of perpetual interconnectedness on an information highway 
without a speed limit with the ever-looming notion of our voluntary abdication of privacy?  
Or do we champion the notion that this website will be 
the demarcation of our generation as the one that brought the 
world together in a unique interconnectedness the world had 
never before dreamed of?  
Regardless of how you see it, we realize critics and social 
scientists are already comparing “The Social Network” as a generation-defining moment in our history comparable to 
what the genius of John Hughes and “The Breakfast Club” 
did for Generation X and what “Rebel Without a Cause” did for the 1950s.  
It’s time to define ourselves, Gators. Go update those sta-
tuses.

Letters to the Editor
UF students deserve more from Brantley
As the prominent newspaper at UF, I was 
wondering if some members of your sports 
staff could do the university a huge favor by informing John Brantley that he needs to step up and become the quarterback all UF faithful 
expect and deserve.
Brantley must become a leader. I suggest 
delivering a speech. A promise wouldn’t hurt 
either. Heck, I’d even let him grow back his “Brantstache” if it leads to improvement. 
I have not lost faith in the season by any 
means. However, a few adjustments are need-ed, and I think it starts at the quarterback with our beloved Johnny B. It’s always great to be 
a Florida Gator, but it’s a little bit nicer when 
we’re the ones dominating the opposition. I guess we all must wait and see what hap-pens.

Thursday columnist presents a needed 
opinion
I was very disappointed to read Kyle Ro-
bisch’s letter to the editor in Friday’s Alliga-
tor. As a former columnist himself, I know Robisch is capable of expressing a meaningful and constructive opinion. Unfortunately , his 
letter falls much more soundly in the category 
of “Playa hatin’.”
I say this because the only thing in his letter 
that could possibly be construed as criticism is saying Bryan Griffin’s column is “never origi-nal and never deviates from the party line.” Not only is this the journalistic equivalent of saying “your mom” in response to something you don’t like and can’t argue against, it’s pa-
tently false. Bryan has written several columns 
on apolitical topics, which, like them or not, 
invalidates Robisch’s party-line argument.
But it is consoling to know this insult comes 
from someone who has only put original, non-
partisan thoughts in his columns. 
“Obama Choosing Cabinet, Staff Wisely” 
and “Palin a weak choice for McCain’s ticket” are completely original thoughts that were 
not repeats of the Democratic Party line and 
certainly could not be found in the bowels of democrats.org. Oh wait.
Griffin is doing exactly what he should be 
doing as a columnist – presenting an alterna-tive argument and generating controversy because of it. He’s received more letters to the editor (Robisch’s included) than any other columnist this semester and is facilitating a 
discussion among students with the paper as 
a forum.
If you don’t agree with Griffin, that’s fine. 
You can write a letter to the editor stating which of arguments you disagree with (Ro-bisch didn’t).  If you don’t like his style as a columnist, you can submit a column of your own that impresses readers with a witty and original style.
The inappropriate response, used to use up 
the Alligator’s pages to print a rant, would be much more appropriate in a Twitter post only read by about seven liberal people who don’t like Griffin’s columns solely because they dis-
agree with their content.
That space would be put to much better 
use if it were filled with the left-wing ram-
blings that usually take up every square inch of space in the paper that isn’t devoted to Grif-fin’s column.

Conservative column lacks oomph
I want to echo Kyle Robisch’s Friday com-
ments regarding Bryan Griffin’s columns. De-spite being a right-leaning moderate myself, Griffin’s writing is bland and banal, which wouldn’t be so bad if it also didn’t exude a 
smug, “look-how-clever-I-am” tone. 
I wish he didn’t sound so impressed with 
himself every week. I read “The Weekly Stan-dard” too, Mr. Griffin. You are not imparting 
new revelations every week.
That’s just my personal opinion, though. 
This isn’t: Griffin is currently running for elected office, namely a seat on the Alachua County Soil and Water Conservation Dis-trict. It may seem like an insignificant office, but it’s frequently used as a stepping stone for aspiring politicians to build a resume on their path to higher office. Griffin’s conserva-tive columns, when viewed in this light, are essentially campaign materials, intended to 
build name recognition and credibility among 
conservative voters.
It is highly inappropriate and unprofession-
al for the Alligator to give Griffin, or any other politician running for office, a free, weekly ad in its newspaper, especially without disclosing this to its readers. This tarnishes the journalis-tic credibility of the Alligator.
I do not blame Griffin for this - if I were a 
politician, I would eagerly accept a job as col-umnist, but it is inexcusable for the Alligator’s editors to let this continue.
If the opinion page editor is unwilling to do 
the right thing and take away Griffin’s column, at least until after the election, and replace him with a conservative/libertarian voice who is 
actually original and articulate, he should at 
least print a disclosure at the bottom of each of Griffin’s columns. And regardless, he should apologize to the Alligator’s readers.

Capitalism not really evil
While I’ve never taken much of what is 
written in the Alligator to be worthy of print, the ignorance of Wednesday’s editorial left me slack-jawed. I can’t say for sure which parts most showed the complete disregard for histo-
ry and, more disgustingly , the implied lack of 
intelligence of the Alligator’s average reader.    
Perhaps the first indication of the drivel to 
follow is the hyperbolic lead with its oh-so-subtle critique of supply and demand. 
The editors may wish to consider no one is 
forcing the parched passerby to patronize the avaricious young entrepreneur. 
The editors may also wish to consider which agent has most successfully “brainwashed” its citizens. Upon consideration they would find them to be the wonderful and hardly free-market National Socialists, the Stalinists of the communist Russian utopia, the ever-peaceful Mao Zedong and his disciples.
In the mind of any rational person, the suc-
ceeding paragraphs can only solidify the opin-ion that the press is generally less informed than the public on matters of import. 
We are not made great by capitalism; we 
are great because the capitalist system al-lows us to make ourselves great. The huge advances in quality of life over the past 200 years derive from the proliferation of capital-
ism in the West.  Even in the face of enormous 
restrictions on trade, the free market and its in-dividualism produced practically everything we can’t live without today. To deny that is to deny history , human accomplishment and the human mind.   
Capitalism at work is billions of people all 
voluntarily engaging each other through trade for their own desires. Capitalism at work is 
food surpluses, effective medicines, easier 
travel and faster communication. The free market is founded on mutual benefit and mu-
tual agreement, not on guns or the megaloma-
niacal schemes of “the people’s” leaders. That, to me, seems fair.  
It’s good the editors won’t be burning Mil-
ton Friedman effigies. Bonfires and illogical beliefs should be the realm of fundamentalist churches, not newspapers.   
And to answer the facetious rhetorical ques-
tion capping the editorial:  No, your lemonade 
stand would not have worked any better. 
Lazy Johnny would have used his popular -
ity to get out of doing work and set himself up 
as leader. Then he would have had his bullies intimidate the other children into doing as he wished. When you dared to question him, he would have them force you to work building his illustrious New People’s Playground of Solidarity, where you would eventually die.  
All the while no one would be served any 
lemonade.

The Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as this year’s 
health care reform bill, should be either gutted or re-pealed. It is failing to achieve the objectives it was de-
signed to produce.
Health care reform was supposed to control costs while also 
expanding health care coverage for those currently lacking.
It marginally succeeds at one and completely misses the 
mark on the other goal. This is not good enough.
The health care reform will, over the next decade, reduce the 
number of uncovered Americans to roughly 15 million, accord-ing to the Congressional Budget Office.
This is an improvement from today, though it certainly 
doesn’t provide coverage for as many people as hoped for.
Those who are covered by expanded government programs will, over time, end up getting inferior access and care from their plans, as a third of doctors have already quit ac-cepting Medicaid patients. This figure is 
likely to rise as the government looks to control costs in the 
coming years.
People covered with a government plan are increasingly 
likely to face rationing and loss of choice about treatments in 
the coming years as well.
Massachusetts, having already adopted a universal health 
care system, is facing sharply rising costs and is looking at ag-gressive means to control costs by limiting access to “low prior -
ity/low value services” and placing a total cap on the expendi-tures of the system each year.While we aren’t about to witness Sarah Palin’s death panels, 
the quality of care provided by the government will sharply decline in the coming years as it begins to ration services and more doctors drop out of the system. The other problem with this reform is that it simply doesn’t bend the cost curve like 
Obama promised. Health care spending, as a proportion of the 
total economy, has been rising sharply for years now.
Under Obama’s plan, however, the rate at which health care 
costs rise, as a proportion of the whole economy, will rise even faster than if we had done nothing, according to data compiled by Richard Foster, chief actuary for the Department of Health and Human Services.

UWirethe ball over four times and its defense forced 
none. Brantley threw two interceptions, both of which led to Alabama touchdowns.
And Florida’s defensive backs failed to get 
their hands on a pass from Alabama quarter -
back Greg McElroy.
In fact, McElroy moved the Alabama of-
fense with ease early, completing eight of 11 
passes for 80 yards on the Crimson Tide’s first 
two drives to give them a 10-0 edge.
Florida’s deficit went from manageable to 
out of hand when its defense was asked to defend a short field on Alabama’s next two drives. Receiver Julio Jones returned a punt 
41 yards into Florida territory and, eight plays 
later, running back Mark Ingram scored his second touchdown of the night. 
Brantley threw an interception on Florida’s 
next drive, leading to another Alabama quick strike. With receiver Marquis Maze lined up at the wildcat quarterback position, Florida’s defense predicted a run at the snap. But Maze pulled up and threw a touchdown to receiver 
Michael Williams in the back-right corner of 
the end zone.
“We were self-destructive,” senior strong 
safety Ahmad Black said. “In order to beat a great team like Alabama, we can’t do that.”
The focus entering the game was on Ala-
bama running backs Ingram and Trent Rich-ardson, who averaged 154 and 89 yards per game, respectively , before Saturday .   
But, relatively speaking, the duo was held 
in check, combining for 110 yards on the ground. Florida’s offense was worse, though, gaining just 79 yards on 31 attempts (2.5 per rush).
Florida fans hoping for solace after Satur -
day can look at the play of the Gators defense 
in the second half. After jumping to a big lead, Alabama was limited to 71 yards in the final 
30 minutes and only scored one touchdown: an interception return by Alabama linebacker 
C.J. Mosely.“Nobody feels sorry for us,” defensive co-
ordinator Teryl Austin said. “Nobody should 
feel sorry for us. And we don’t want people to 
feel sorry for us.” 8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2010 8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2010

Ahmad BlackP/K Chas Henry: 3 punts, 62.3 yards per, 2 Inside 20; 2-2 FGs, 
Long of 39 yards; 1 TacklePutting a punter at the top of this list is perhaps evidence of how poor Florida played Saturday. But, to be fair, Henry was UF’s most effective offensive player in the first half, showing why his name is on the Ray Guy watch list. Henry launched a 75-yard punt 
that was downed at the Alabama two-yard line late in the second quarter. The punt eventually set up a short field for Florida, and when the offense stalled Henry nailed a 39-yard field goal, the first of his career. He even flashed some tackling skills, bringing down 220-pound Julio Jones after his 41-yard return. 
DE Duke Lemmens: 8 tackles; 1 sackWith his ability to shift from end to linebacker, Lemmens has essentially been the centerpiece of Florida’s run-stopping “heavy package” this season. And while the defense was not immune to Florida’s overall struggles (Alabama gained 148 yards on its first two drives), the Gators did a solid job againstthe run, with Lemmens leading the way. Heisman winner Mark Ingram averaged 154 rushing yards in his first two games, but he was limited to 47 yards on the ground Saturday.SWAMP STUDS

SS Ahmad Black: 7 tackles; 1 forced fumble
Black has been Florida’s defensive leader this season, and he’ll be expected to rally the unit this week. Black ranked second on the team in tackles and, although the final result seemed inevitable, his forced fumble could have swung the momentum in Florida’s favor if the ball bounced the right way. WithAlabama leading 10-0 and driving toward its eventual third score, Black jarred the ball loose from running back Trent Richardson. But, of course, the ball did not fall into the hands of a Gator and was actually advanced two more yards when Julio Jones recovered it.With a chance to take an early 
lead, Florida drove the ball all the way to Alabama’s two-yard line and decided to put the ball in Burton’s hands three straight times. From just 
one yard out, the Gators decided to 
go for the touchdown on fourth down and attempted a jump pass with the freshman at quarterback. But Burton threw an interception to Nico Johnson, ruining any chance at an early lead.TURNING POINT

MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 13
son.
If you expect a team with that kind 
of inexperience to enter Bryant-Denny 
Stadium – which is the nicest and loud-
est stadium I have ever been to – and 
pull off an upset win over the No. 1 
team in the nation, you are absolutely crazy.
UF’s defense held the dirty duo of 
Mark Ingram and Trent Richardson 
to a combined 110 rushing yards and quarterback Greg McElroy to just 84 
passing yards, but still lost. 
Those stats should be good enough 
to beat the Crimson Tide, but not when 
another team is that much better than 
you.
Florida is not a top-10 team right 
now and that’s saying a lot with na-
tional powers such as Texas and USC struggling. 
The Gators are 60th in the nation in total offense, only ahead of LSU, Ten-nessee, South Carolina and lowly Van-derbilt within the conference.
This team is going to struggle and 
is going to have to grind out wins this season.
However, due to the parody in 
the SEC, the Gators still have a good 
chance at earning a trip to Atlanta for 
the conference championship.
The SEC East is horrible with Geor -
gia and Tennessee struggling.
South Carolina is the only team 
that could ruin UF’s plans. But Steve Spurrier doesn’t have any confidence in quarterback Stephen Garcia, so why should outsiders? 
The Gators have insisted its goal 
this season is to get to Atlanta this sea-son and, despite the loss, it is still in line to do that. 
That’s an appropriate bar to set for 
this team because it can’t exceed that.
As was evident on Saturday, Ala-
bama won’t let it.ANTHONY , from page 15
“I was trying to get down to my check 
down and I didn’t see [Mosley],” Brantley 
said of his interception. “And then when I 
slid over and found a throwing line, I just tried to do it too quick.”
A week after throwing the first intercep-
tion of his career as a starter against Ken-
tucky, Brantley threw this first pick-six.  
Brantley scanned the field deep before 
checking down to running back Emmanuel 
Moody, but Mosley stepped in front of the 
pass and broke one tackle before scoring 
easily . 
On UF’s next possession, Brantley led 
the Gators down the field on a 77-yard drive 
before botching an exchange with Moody on the one-yard line. Brantley failed to re-
cover the fumble, and Alabama once again 
came away with the turnover. 
“[The red zone offense] was awful,” 
coach Urban Meyer said. 
“We just have to get bet-
ter. It was real disap-
pointing. That game is a different game I think. I don’t know if we would 
have beat them because 
they were pretty good 
today, but we self de-structed.”
Alabama’s front seven recorded just one 
sack against Brantley but pressured him the entire night — one Brantley would just as soon forget.UF’s red-zone offense struggles

TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETT UF FOOTBALL alligatorSports.orgBy KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — John Brantley laid 
flat on his back as the training staff ran onto 
the field to tend to Florida’s starting quarter -
back. 
Down 25 points in the fourth quarter, UF 
needed eight yards to convert a desperate fourth-down try from the Alabama 20-yard line. Brantley eluded a would-be sack in the backfield, stepped up in the pocket and then took off before two Alabama defenders con-verged on him, stopping him a yard short. 
It was the literal and figurative knockout 
punch after a night of body shots laid on the Gators’ first-year starting quarterback. 
Brantley put the hit behind him, walked 
off the field under his own power and came 
back out for the next posses-sion down 31-6. 
The question for the Gators 
is, will Brantley be able to put a nightmarish performance 
in Bryant-Denny Stadium be-
hind him when LSU rolls into 
Gainesville next weekend?
“Personally, I’m sorry, but it doesn’t mat-
ter,” Brantley said. “It’s a team thing.”
Brantley was coming off the best perfor -
mance of his career, going 24 for 35 for 248 
yards and a touchdown against Kentucky , 
but his development took a serious step back 
Saturday night. 
UF’s signal caller went 16 for 31 for 202 
yards and two interceptions against the Crim-
son Tide.
The only touchdown he threw went up on 
the board for Alabama. When the Gators took over for their second 
offensive possession of the second half, there 
was still a glimmer of hope. 
Brantley hit wide receiver Deonte Thomp-
son for a 24-yard gain to move UF off its own goal line, and it looked like the Gators may have shifted some of the momentum in Bry-ant-Denny Stadium. 
Two plays later, Brantley made the worst 
pass of his five-start career. Alabama line-backer C.J. Mosley ran away with the momen-tum and the Crimson Tide ran away with the game. 
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF quarterback John Brantley completed 16 of 31 passes and threw for 202 yards Saturday. He struggled at times, throwing two interceptions and botching a handoff against Alabama.

SEE BRANTLEY, p AGE 13
In reality this game didn’t mean 
much, but its result sent one very clear message.
Even though Florida was man-
handled Saturday, it can still and probably will achieve its goal: win the SEC East. However, that’s 
where it stops.
The Gators learned on Saturday 
that the 2010 season won’t end with 
a conference championship. 
As the clock ran down to zero, 
they came crashing down to earth to the tune of a 31-6 loss and reality set in.Florida is 
not on the same level as 
Alabama. 
It’s not any 
indictment on 
Urban Meyer 
or any of his 
players, but just a result of the team’s 
youth and inexperience. At least 
nine of the Gators’ 22 starters were 
not regular starters before this sea-Loss a sign of things to come

After five weeks of relying on strong de-
fense to grind out tough wins, the Gators put 
on an offensive showcase Sunday . 
No. 2 Florida (12-1, 5-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) hit .408 and smacked a season-high 12 aces in its 3-0 (25-19, 25-13, 25-17) win against Arkansas (9-8, 3-3 SEC) in the O’Connell Cen-ter.
The offensive outburst was the continuation 
of a trend the Gators started Friday night, when they hit .323, only put five shots out of bounds and ended No.16 LSU’s undefeated season in 
straight sets. 
UF totaled a season-low 3.5 blocks but still 
cruised to victory behind its dominating at-tack. 
“I thought the story of this match was defi-
nitely our offense,” coach Mary Wise said. “We 
felt our players did a really nice job attacking 
the ball.”
Outside hitter Kristy 
Jaeckel and middle blocker Lauren Bledsoe were Sun-day’s leaders, as Jaeckel re-corded 11 kills on .524 hitting while Bledsoe notched seven kills on .636 hitting. 
Both Jaeckel and Bledsoe 
were errorless in the match. 
As a team, the Gators hit just one attack out of bounds, as six of their seven errors were the re-sult of Arkansas blocks. 
Five of those blocks came in the opening set, Gators sweep past Razorbacks

UF outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel recorded 11 kills without 
committing a hitting error Sunday. 
Murphy racks 
up eight aces
after which the Gators diversified the offense 
and started feeding the pipeline to keep the Ra-zorbacks off balance. 
“Arkansas is a very good one-option block-
ing team, meaning if it’s a predictable attack 
on our part that’s what Arkansas defends the 
best,” Wise said. “We just didn’t make as many smart swings early on and Arkansas took ad-vantage of it. Then we got into a pretty good offensive rhythm and there were a lot fewer blocks by the end.”
While the Gators eventually worked their 
way into an offensive rhythm, they were also able to keep the Razorbacks out of one with 
dominant serving. 
Junior Kelly Murphy led the way with a ca-
reer-high eight aces, including four in her first 
trip to the line, as the Gators smashed 12 on the afternoon. 
“Once I got the first two it really built my 
confidence up so I just went back there and felt pretty comfortable taking a harder rip,” Mur -
phy said. 
Although Florida recorded just 3.5 blocks, 
the defense on the whole played a solid match. 
UF held Arkansas to a .108 hitting efficiency 
and kept the SEC’s No. 2 kill-scorer, Jasmine Norton, to just four kills and .000 hitting. 
With Erin Fleming sitting out the match af-
ter potentially suffering a mild concussion in Friday’s tilt, junior transfer Cinthya Roberto got her first start as a Gator. 
In her first ever match as a libero, Roberto 
had what Wise called an “outstanding” perfor -
mance, recording eight digs and consistently making solid passes for her setters. VOLLEY , from page 15

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — In the midst of Urban Meyer’s sec-
ond-worst loss as the Gators’ head coach, a punter provided 
the only bright spot.
Chas Henry , who is already on the Ray Guy Award watch 
list, filled in on field goal duties for injured kicker Caleb Sturgis against Alabama on Saturday and was perfect.
“Everything came through on Thursday,” Henry said. “It 
was the first day I started kicking this week, but we had done it the previous couple of weeks because he has been injured for a little bit.”
Sturgis has been struggling with a back in-
jury for most of the season and it was evident as he missed two of four field goals through the 
first four games of the season. 
Henry , on the other hand, was dead on against the Crimson 
Tide. The senior knocked in 39- and 21-yard field goals while 
also booting three punts for an average of 62.3 yards. 
“I was very comfortable (kicking field goals),” he said. “This 
is what we do for the rest of the time in practice when we don’t have anything to do.”
But Florida didn’t just lose its field goal kicker. Henry had 
to give up his duties as field-goal holder in order to replace 
Sturgis. Instead, freshman John Crofoot took that role and was 
flawless.
Henry was told he will be UF’s field goal specialist for the 
remainder of the season.
“[Sturgis] did an amazing job for what he was going 
through,” he said. “The coaches came to me last week and said, ‘It’s pretty serious and we have to go with you from here on.’”Henry fills in as 
field goal kicker
