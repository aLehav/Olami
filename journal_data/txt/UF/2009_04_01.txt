UF would lay off about 140 faculty and 
staff under the 10-percent budget proposals 
that have been released by its colleges so far.
The proposals from UF’s 16 colleges and 
13 administrative units are due to UF Provost Joe Glover today, though some may come in a little late, Glover said.
Fourteen colleges have released their pro-
posals, or drafts of them, so far.
The College of Veterinary Medicine and 
the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences had not released their proposals as of Tuesday 
afternoon. No proposals for administrative 
units, which include the offices of the presi-dent and provost, could be obtained.
The number of people who would be laid 
off under the proposals is only one measure 
of how many people could lose their jobs if UF has to cut its state-funded budget 
by 10 percent, or $72 million to $75 million.  There are also dozens of temporary faculty, such as adjunct faculty members or visiting professors, as well as graduate assistants and student workers whose contracts would not be renewed, all of which do not count as lay-offs. After most of the proposals are turned in today, and stragglers submit theirs over the next few days, Glover said his office will 
begin analyzing the data and prioritizing the Cuts mean 140 UF staff may face lay offs

The 20 students enrolled in UF’s award-
winning Documentary Institute would be the 
last to graduate before its program ceases to exist under a $909,000 budget cut proposal unveiled last week.
College of Journalism and Communica-
tions Dean John Wright’s proposal would eliminate the Documentary Institute and its accompanying master’s degree program in documentary film.
The program’s removal would cause four 
faculty, two of whom are tenured professors, to lose their jobs, in addition to seven faculty positions and one staff position that would 
be slashed from other areas in the college. 
“I’m just scratching my head at all of this,” 
said Churchill Roberts, co-director of the in-stitute.   
Roberts said the institute received support 
from  Wright until the college was hit with 
budget cuts.
“But he never really asked us about the 
program, so maybe that means he just wasn’t interested,” Roberts said. 
The ll-year-old master’s program is na-
tionally ranked among the best academic documentary programs. Work produced by 
students in the college has also been nomi-
nated for the student Emmy Award for best student documentary the past three years and won the award the past two years.
“I’ve talked to several people about this, 
and they all said that a good university would protect its good programs,” Roberts said. “They’d find a way.”
In an interview last week, Wright said he 
� VIOLATING BARS MUST STOP 
ADMITTING PATRONS UNDER 21.
Bars will face stiffer penalties for un-
derage drinking violations starting today, 
as a contested Gainesville ordinance takes 
effect.
The ordinance requires that the city tally 
bars’ underage drinking violations, forcing 
bars that exceed the specified number of vi-olations, depending on capacity, to refuse 
entrance to patrons under 21 years old.
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, a recently re-elect-
ed city commissioner who championed the 
ordinance, believes that it has improved the situation even before taking effect, she said.
“There is already a lot more interest 
from bar owners in reduc-ing violations,” she said, citing a presentation given 
by GPD on the subject.
The purpose of the 
ordinance is not to elimi-
nate underage drinking, but to put pressure on ir-
responsible bars who con-
sistently serve underage patrons, she said.
GPD spokesman Keith Kameg was not 
available for comment.

Man exposes self outside of Shands
Organs of a different type were on display 
outside UF’s McKnight Brain Institute Monday 
night. 
Police are still looking for a man who ex-
posed his genitals to two females outside the Evelyn F. & William L. McKnight Brain Institute at about 10 p.m., according to the University Po-lice Department. The suspect first approached a Shands at UF employee leaving the institute, which is near the hospital, and asked her for money, according to UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb.When she told him she didn’t have any, he 
allegedly pulled his pants down, exposing his genitals to the woman. The suspect was report-edly wearing light green scrubs and had an ID badge on his shirt. He then exposed himself to a second, unidentified woman before leaving the scene in a small purple car with a spoiler. 
He is described as a 35- to 40-year-old man, 
about 5 feet 10 inches, 220 pounds, with short black hair. Holcomb asked anyone with infor-mation about the crime to contact UPD.

Special Olympics fights 
use of word ‘retard’
WASHINGTON — The Spe-
cial Olympics launched a cam-
paign Tuesday to banish the 
word “retard,” a casual insult 
that derives from an out-of-fa-vor medical term and has long been considered inappropriate.
People signed pledges not to 
use the word and students gath-ered to denounce its use at ral-lies across the nation. Over the long-term, organizers hope to 
change attitudes about people 
with mental disabilities, who number more than 190 million worldwide, according to the 
World Health Organization.
“It’s insulting, it’s painful 
and it hurts people,” said actor 
Eddie Barbanell, who has Down syndrome and appeared in the 
movie “The Ringer.” ‘’Get that 
word out! End the word! Bury it!”
While “retard” itself was 
never a medical term, it derives from the phrase “mental retar-dation,” which by around 1900 was commonly used by scien-tists and doctors, said Peter 
Berns, executive director of The 
Arc of the United States, a non-profit advocate for those with intellectual and developmental 
disabilities.

Fla. bill seeks to generate

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — 
Florida’s private power compa-
nies would have to generate 20 
percent of their power through 
clean sources by 2020 under a bill that took its first step in the Senate.
Companies would be able 
to count nuclear power toward that goal, but it could be no more than 25 percent of their clean energy mix.The bill would 
also add a penny per gallon tax 
on gasoline, with half the money going to the Renewable Energy 
Trust Fund.
The bill (SB 1154) was ap-
proved by its first committee 
Tuesday on a 6-3 vote, with two senators opposed because of the gas tax. Gov. Charlie Crist sup-
ports the bill and the goal of us-
ing more solar and wind power.

Westgate PlazaTwo faculty members in the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences will be laid off 
June 30 to make way for the reinstatement of two assistant professors last week, accord-ing to Paul D’Anieri, dean of the college.
The faculty members, who are not eli-
gible for tenure, are in the languages, litera-tures and cultures departments, he wrote.
No classes will be canceled as a result of 
the layoffs, he wrote.
The faculty will be let go to cut costs add-
ed by the reinstatement of assistant profes-sors Andrea Pham and Hana Filip. Pham’s layoff was overturned earlier this month 
by an arbitrator who ruled UF violated its 
contract with the faculty union when it laid her off. Filip, who also filed a grievance, was reinstated because she was laid off under similar circumstances.
A grievance filed last year on behalf of 
laid-off lecturer Rose Lugano has not been settled yet.They were three of eight UF faculty 
members who lost their jobs during the last round of budget cuts.
D’Anieri also wrote that the college has 
changed its 10 percent budget cut proposal, 
which is due to UF Provost Joe Glover today. Under the change, the priority of cuts would be different. In-stead of the geological sci-
ences department being in Tier 8, which would mean it would be cut before the religion department, in 
Tier 10, the departments 
would be split among the two tiers.
This means if the college has to make 
large cuts, both departments will make cuts 
at the same time instead of the geological sciences department having to make cuts first.

America celebrates the gullible 
today with April Fools’ Day, and 
some students hope the holiday, that 
brings with it a tradition of pranks and practical jokes, will play in their favor.
Giacomo Savardi, a UF student, 
sat studying for a differential equa-tions test with his notebook, various worksheets and laptop outside of Fletcher Hall Tuesday evening.
While he said he’s ready to get the 
test over with, it would be a “pleas-ant surprise” if his professor can-celed it as an April Fool’s prank, he 
said.Of the roughly 50 University of 
Florida students interviewed for this 
article, only about six could remem-ber, or were willing to share, April 
Fools’ pranks that involved themself 
or someone they knew.
Jamie Chapin, a UF 
finance major, was the only student inter-
viewed who fell victim 
to an elaborate prank.
One year, when opening the door 
to his room, he triggered a string 
of firecrackers placed there by his

Like a modern Atlas, Lansana 
Camara holds up the world for 25 
severely disabled orphans in Con-akry, Guinea.
Camara lives in Gainesville and 
makes money by making and sell-
ing musical instruments and play-
ing for donations.
He sends the money back to 
Guinea to support the orphans in 
addition to his five children and 
his brother’s three.
After saving for years to fly 
from Guinea to Germany, where 
he stayed for months to raise 
enough to travel the rest of the 
way to the United States, Camara 
arrived in 2005 and has played as often as possible since his arrival.
“I take care of their shoes, their 
clothes, their lives,” he said.
Camara plays his kora, an Af-
rican harp he made from wood, nylon and cow skin, for donations at local festivals and events like 
last week’s ONE campaign event 
to promote awareness of problems 
in Africa.
In addition to his performances 
for donations, Camara gives one 
to two free performances a month 
during music classes at the Sidney 
Lanier School for children with se-vere disabilities.
Camara said he gets $50 or 
more for playing at a party, wed-ding or festival, and as soon as he gets enough extra for a plane ticket, he flies to Guinea to spend 
as much time with his family as he 
can afford and make more instru-ments to bring back to the United States. “They need me there every day 
to teach them, but when I’m not there, my younger brother teaches 
them,” he said.
In a good month at home, Ca-
mara said he and his brother can 
make up to 20 instruments, which he then sells in the U.S. for  $500-$600. Usually, he sells his instru-ments to school band programs or 
individuals.
He said that if the children are 
hungry, though, he will sell them 
for whatever he can get.“If they need food,” he said, “I 
have to sell them for almost noth-
ing.”
Camara’s family, which totals 
more than 35, lives in a three-
bedroom house that costs $100 a 
month to rent, and $50 worth of 
rice will only feed his family for about 10-14 days, he said.
In Guinea, the children sing 
and dance for donations and 
call themselves Group Laiengee, 
which means “group together.”
Camara is saving to meet a 
$10,000 goal that would allow him 
to purchase two vans so the family 
doesn’t have to rent them in order 
to get to their performances, which 
is expensive. Walking is too slow, he said, because many are missing 
limbs or have severe mental dis-
abilities. 
“In Guinea, it’s a big, big differ-
ence from here to there,” he said, and homeless children lie in the 
street waiting to beg for money 
from travelers on foot. Camara 
said the vans will also allow them 
to travel during bad weather.
“Some months, it rains and 
rains and doesn’t stop,” he said. “The vans will let us travel any-
way.”
Camara said his next goal is to 
lease a building to use as a school 
and a storefront to sell their instru-ments in downtown Conakry. 
“If I get money today, then I’ll 
go back next week,” he said. “I just want to help them.”AROUND GAINESVILLE

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A federal jury 
on Tuesday recommended death for two men convict-
ed of gunning down a family of four, including two young children, prompting one of the defendants to curse and hurl a plastic bottle toward prosecutors be-
fore he was dragged from the courtroom.
The sentence marks the first federal death penalty 
recommended in Florida since Congress reinstated 
capital punishment in 1988.
District Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley said he would 
impose the final sentence for Daniel Troya and Ricardo Sanchez Jr., both 25, at a later hearing.The two were convicted March 5 of fatally shoot-
ing Jose Luis Escobedo, 28; his wife, Yessica Guerrero Escobedo, 25; and their sons, Luis Julian, 4, and Luis Damian, 3. They were found slain alongside Florida’s 
Turnpike on Oct. 13, 2006.
“Ladies and gentlemen, when you 
leave the courtroom today, you need to 
leave with your heads held high,” Judge Hurley told the jury before excusing them.

Fifty-six businesses and residenc-
es have signed up for Gainesville’s 
solar feed-in tariff, with UF possibly adding one building to the list.
Gainesville Regional Utilities has 
surpassed its 2009 and 2010 four-megawatt cap, resulting in a waiting list for the program. The cap was put in place to prevent increasing energy bills by more than 1 percent.
On March 1, GRU launched its 
solar feed-in tariff, the first U.S. pro-gram of its kind to offer a long-term contract and a guaranteed price for 
energy produced. Customers sign-
ing onto the tariff invest in their own solar panels to generate electric-ity and sell energy directly to GRU under 20-year contracts at a fixed price.
For participating homeowners, 
energy bills increase about 93 cents per month, with the money going 
toward the $1.5 million program. 
They are compensated for their in-volvement, receiving as much as 32 cents for every kilowatt generated.
GRU solar project coordinator 
Rachel Meek said UF might sign a new off-campus building up for the program. 
“We don’t have any paperwork 
from them yet, but we have talked,” Meek said.
Construction at the eligible build-
ing, located at UF’s Eastside campus on Waldo Road,  is scheduled to be-gin in about two months and should be complete in a year, said Ed Pop-pell, UF’s vice president of business affairs.“We’re exploring everything,” 
Poppell said. “We want to do as much solar as possible.”
The energy on UF’s main cam-
pus is currently provided by Prog-ress Energy, which  Poppell said is willing to buy any solar energy pro-duced by the university.
In an average year, UF spends 
about $38 million on electricity and uses 75 megawatts, according to UF’s Web site. 
One of UF’s setbacks for intro-
ducing more solar panels is the lack of upfront money, but Poppell said the university is  addressing this by working with companies that spe-cialize in solar manufacturing and 
installation.
Additionally,  on-campus build-
ings aren’t good candidates for solar 
energy due to shade created by UF’s landscaping.
Meek said that interested busi-
nesses include Stoneridge Apart-ments, Gainesville Tire Services and several storage facilities.
“It’s been a broad variety of cus-
tomers,” she said. “It’s kind of all over the place.”
But interested customers 
shouldn’t be discouraged, Meek said. They might be able to sign up sooner than they think because businesses and residences could be bumped higher on the list if partici-
pants don’t meet time constraints on 
solar panel construction.GRU reaches goals

With President Barack

potential candidates for the 2012 presidential election.
After a lengthy discus-

we came to a collective agree-

Sadly, one staffer (already reeling from a tragic Spring

In one of the biggest acts of intergalactic narcissism to 
date, Stephen Colbert — host of Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report” — hijacked a NASA contest to 
get his name among the stars.
NASA’s public outreach started innocently enough. In 
order to foster interest in the space program, the agency conducted an online poll to name the International Space 
Station’s new Node 3, set to be installed this year. The 
space agency had four options for voters to choose from as well as a place where voters could suggest other names as write-ins.
Seizing the opportunity to not only see his name in out-
er space but also to topple Xenu — Galactic Confederacy overlord and then highest-voted write-in — the late-night television show host called on the members of the Colbert nation to act, and act they did.
To the shock of absolutely no one, it worked. At Col-
bert’s command, his name received over 230,000 votes, skyrocketing him to the top of the list. NASA’s suggested “Serenity” was the closest contender, with about 40,000 fewer votes than “Colbert.”
It’s not like Colbert needs any extra publicity. The man 
ran for president and was one of TIME’s 100 most influ-ential people last year, for goodness’ sake. This shameless self-promoter just couldn’t pass up the chance to see his 
name somewhere else.
Perhaps NASA should be thanking Colbert. 
By pulling in as many people as he did to vote on the 
name of the new node, Colbert managed to give NASA the coveted “Colbert Bump,” which has been bestowed 
on various Democratic politicians, the Firefox 3 Internet 
browser and Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee (al-though Conan O’Brien and Jon Stewart may debate the last one). 
The bump is a force to be reck-
oned with. While Colbert’s move 
to get his name on the node was 
self-serving, it boosted NASA’s image in the process. If they were smart, they’d name the node “Col-
bert.” The attention it would bring 
would be a godsend to the strug-
gling space program.
But if Colbert gets his way, a space node will just be 
another item to add to the list of things named after him. 
Also on the list are an eagle, a Ben & Jerry’s ice cream fla-
vor, the mascot of the Saginaw Spirit hockey team, a Vir-gin America plane and a turtle.
Colbert even had a day named after him — March 20, 
2007 — in Ontario. For bombastic Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A., that just wasn’t enough.
NASA has not released an official statement yet, but 
what could they say other than a heartfelt oops? As NASA noted in the competition rules, it still maintains the right 
to assign the node an appropriate name that represents 
the “spirit of cooperation and exploration” of the Interna-tional Space Station.
While Colbert’s win does represent democratic coop-
eration and the unity of his fans, it is basically the slickest form of exploitation. He was able to sit back and wait for his cronies to deliver, boosting his popularity at the same time.
You have to hand it to him — the man is an absolute 
genius.

New cigarette tax will do more harm than good
Today marks the first day of the new cigarette tax, and as 
I prepare myself for the inevitable trips to Georgia to buy car-
tons, I wonder how the government ever managed to pass such a discriminatory tax. Ignoring the obvious problems with co-vertly making an activity illegal through taxation (Stamp Act, 
anyone?), I’m going to focus on the tangible consequences of 
this tax.
First, the people most affected will undoubtedly be the 
working poor. The middle and upper class will have little problem adjusting to this, but with family budgets tightening the lower class will be forced to either quit smoking, or sacri-fice another expense. So the financial burden imposed by this tax will undoubtedly be placed on those whose finances are already stretched to the breaking point. 
This is also a blatantly anti-capitalistic government action. 
The sales tax applies to all goods, including cigarettes. Now in addition to the sales tax, cigarettes will be taxed again. 
By placing a heavier tax burden on one product the govern-
ment is directly discouraging use. Local gas stations and con-venience stores rely heavily on cigarette sales, especially since their profits from gasoline sales have been greatly reduced. Mobil might not go under, but the guy who owns the Mobil down the street might lose his business if sales drop. 
In an economic climate where creating new jobs is the main 
goal, why are we implementing a tax that will put a specific group of people in danger of losing their jobs?

� � �Legalizing pot would harm society 
Yea, let’s go ahead and legalize it. Let’s also allow everyone to carry a gun because then ev-
erything will be “safer.” Better yet, let’s allow North Korea and Iran to have all the nuclear bombs they want because if we al-low it, their interests in them will eventually decrease, right? It 
doesn’t matter if it doesn’t cause as many deaths as other drugs 
or that it’s not as bad as people make it out to be, the point is that it’s still bad.  I grew up watching my father doing this stuff and eventually falling into other drugs. He spent nine years in prison clean and when he got out, he still had a problem. Mari-juana is in no way good and should not be legalized. 
More people will be addicted to it and as it will be much 
easier to obtain, kids will also be able to get their hands on it.

Cutting Geology program not answer to budget woes 
I am a fourth-year senior in the Department of Geologi-
cal Sciences, a department that despite its prolific publication record and contributions to scholarship is now facing the ax. If the state revenues are as dire as predicted, the college will require that we cut all the lab managers, nontenured faculty 
and an office worker (we only have three). In simple terms, this 
means that for every $9 cut from the budget, one dollar comes directly from geology.  
When I asked why we were asked to give up so much, I was 
told it’s because we don’t have enough Ph.D. or undergraduate students to justify our funding. Though our major is small, it can’t be said that we don’t generate enough credit hours. Half of all students who attend UF will take a geology class.  We have twice the number of majors as astronomy and nearly as many Ph.D. candidates. 
One of the reasons for the lack of Ph.D. students comes from 
the success of geologists in the marketplace. M.S. And B.S. stu-dents find it easy to obtain high-paying jobs. Just last year, my friend Jesse graduated from UF with a B.A. and was immedi-
ately hired by Schlumberger (a major player in the petroleum 
industry) and is grossing more than $50,000 a year.
This would not have been possible without the faculty and 
staff the dean wants to cut.    
Without a doubt, the greatest tragedy is the loss of the 
young, nontenured professors, whose passion and enthusiasm have inspired me and all of my peers. I had never given any thought to majoring in geology until Matt Smith took a per-sonal interest in my education. Every year, another lecturer/
researcher, Jim Vogl, leads students across the country, at great 
personal sacrifice, to teach lessons in the field. I fell in love with geology, not to mention The Gator Nation, on one such trip to North Carolina where we climbed mountains to search for rubies.  Now in my senior year I work for Kyoungwon “Kyle” Min, a dedicated teacher and fruitful researcher, on uranium/thorium decay.  I must admit, geology is not a “sexy” science. A rock is a rock. It was yesterday, and it will be tomorrow. But it is those rocks that contain the oil we rely on, the diamonds we 
covet and the metals we will use to manufacture our future.
We accept the fact of climate change because rocks record 
the climate of ages past, and geologists read that record. 
Every top-10 research university has a geology department, 
and if UF wants to remain Florida’s flagship university and rel-
evant in today’s changing world, it needs its geologists.

Did you know that someone, after 
breaking up with her bow, (not “beau;” you’ll see where this is go-
ing) actually got married to the Eiffel Tower?
This is not a diatribe against some new-
fangled city charter amendment or some sort of metaphor, but an invitation to sit and re-flect for a moment.
She dated a piece of archery equipment. 
She’s married. To the Eiffel Tower. 
There are about 40 individuals in the 
world who, for reasons unknown to psychol-ogy or to science, are exclusively attracted to public objects. 
Examples included but are not limited to: 
the Eiffel Tower, the Berlin Wall (now wid-owed), a fencepost, a carnival ride and the Golden Gate Bridge. 
These people, deemed objectumsexuals, 
are so rare, so esoteric, that they even escape the omnipotence of Wikipedia. Their antics of weird, public masturbation have only been documented a handful of times. I have seen one of these documentaries twice. I will never be the same.
The existence of such a group makes me wonder what sort of power they could have if they were politically mobilized (the best part of this daydream obviously being Richard Selwach trying to keep them out of public re-strooms, lest they decide to stick their collec-tive dicks inside a hand dryer). 
The documentary I watched claimed that 
less than 100 “OS” people exist. But a quick Google search fielded many communities for people with this specific fetish, which sug-gests that these people make up at least a percentage of our population.  In case you’re interested, some choice selections include “objectsofmine,” “abstractwarmth,” and “ap-pliancelove.” 
What’s more, I bet the number 40 will pro-
liferate into something like 40,000. Whether we look at text messaging, instant messeng-ing, Facebook or e-mail, the way humans in-teract is increasingly mediated by inscription and communication technologies.  
People getting married on World of War-
craft is just a sign of the larger trend to come. There are people who connect to Xbox Live more than they will ever connect with anoth-er human being.Even though I feel 
that I’m giving this thing far too much credit as a legitimate sexual expression (when it’s probably just a mixture be-tween Asperger’s and a history of abuse), it poses other 
interesting thought experiments. 
For example: What does it really mean 
when you say you “love” your iPhone? 
Another: Can an object break up with 
you? 
Another: If your love-object is a guillotine, 
does that also make you a masochist?
Anyway, I’m sure that if I could stop 
laughing for a second, I could use object-sexuality as a springboard to dissect at least some aspect of our culture.
The laughing part coupled with the re-
vulsion, though, is making me feel guilty. I’d like to think I’m open-minded, but I can’t tell where I’m supposed to draw the line. Pe-rusing some of the online communities for OS people wasn’t as creepy as I expected. In fact, lots of the posts were well-reasoned and heartfelt, and the other ones (by the innumer-able hackers) brought legitimate sadness to the community members, who still remained undeterred in their quest to express them-selves. 
I think where I find myself is halfway 
between disapproval and sympathy. It goes without saying that one of the most reward-ing aspects of life comes from engaging oth-ers in meaningful discourse. 
Focusing on something inanimate is al-
most egotistical; you can’t be contradicted, dissected or challenged. If clinging to cold steel is a behavior that can’t be unlearned, though, do what you have to do in order to attain some semblance of intimacy.
Although, as I sort this out there is prob-
ably a sitcom in the works about a wild and wacky objectumsexual stripper who loves her job (and her pole) and then teaches her friends that she’s just like them. I’ll just wait until then.

This past summer, I thor-oughly enjoyed my study abroad experience to Meri-
da, Mexico, the capital of the state of Yucatan. 
It is a tranquil place, with lots of 
markets for things like fish, fresh produce, hammocks and more. Study abroad is a unique opportu-nity to learn more about a culture from the perspective of its people. What is disconcerting is what I dis-covered about the role of Ameri-cans in causing violence in the country that was such a gracious host to me.I was sitting in the living room 
of my host family and practicing my Spanish with my host mom. We conversed about simple things, un-til I switched the subject to crime in the region. Once I asked her about that, she became quite serious.
She told me that a year before I 
got there, about a block or so away from her house, the police found the head of a man in the middle of the street, and his decapitated body was left in the neighborhood park. I probed further, and she told me of another instance where a woman with an infant was gunned down on one of the main streets in a middle 
class neighborhood. Both killings were “porque las drogas y los nar-cos.”
I did not really put all of these 
stories together until I read about the war that is still going on as we speak between the Mexican gov-ernment and the Mexican drug car-tels. The main market for the drug lords is, guess where, the United States. The drug lords have been stepping up their brazen attacks, most of which were localized in the northern part of Mexico, but have since been spreading all over the country.
The billions of dollars in rev-
enue drugs generate allow the cartels to buy off many of the very officials that are supposed to stop them. The few people that try to stand in their way often end up in body bags.
Secretary of State Hillary Clin-
ton recently indicted the American population when she said that our demand fuels the cartels to supply. The primary drug the cartels trans-port across the border is marijuana, which is a favorite for many col-lege students. So the next time any of you use marijuana, think about the source. Putting aside your health, consider that something as simple as getting college students something besides cigarettes to smoke has caused Mexico to be on the verge of failed state status. 
Every time a college student 
takes a puff, he or she is respon-sible for the blood spilled to get it there.

People jogging around Lake Al-
ice have more to worry about than 
a sunburn now that the weather is warming up.
Alligators in north Florida come 
out of hibernation in March, said Tony Young, the media relations coordinator for The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.  
“They’re hungry, they’re look-
ing for food and mating season is just around the corner,” Young said. 
“You just need to be aware.”
Young said that male alligators 
become more aggressive around 
mating season.
Parents with small children 
should not let them play near water without supervision, he said. Dogs are also at risk.
“Dogs are definitely some of the 
favorite prey of alligators,” Young said.
Brandon Moore, a UF biology 
graduate student who has studied alligators for seven years, said there are two important rules to remain 
safe while in the presence of alliga-
tors.
“Never feed an alligator, ever,” 
Moore said.
Alligators have a natural disposi-
tion to move away when approached by people, but this can change when they’re fed.
Also, give the alligator distance, 
he said, and let it go about its way.
If people find themselves in a 
threatening situation, they should move away slowly and quietly.
“Running is rarely a good thing 
to do in the wild,” Moore said. Run-ning makes a person look like prey, which can provoke the animal.
Since 1948, there have been more 
than 275 unprovoked attacks in Florida, and 17 people have been killed, according to an alligator safety brochure on the commission’s Web site.
The first alligator attack of the 
year happened in Lake Worth in January, when an alligator injured a man’s hand and pulled him under water, according to an article in the Palm Beach Post.
Joe Fiore, a UF alumnus, visits 
Lake Alice to unwind after work and sees people feeding the turtles.
He said he thinks that the alliga-
tors aren’t afraid of people because of it.
“It’s not good for them,” he said. 
“Just let them be.” LOcALAlligators out of hibernation merit safety precautions

■ THE BILL WILL NOW INCREASE TAXES ON 
SMOKELESS TOBACCO USERS.
THE ASSOcIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Cigarette and cigar smok-
ers and those who use smokeless tobacco would pay more 
to satisfy their habits under legislation that won unani-mous approval Tuesday from a Senate committee.
The bill would increase Florida’s tax on cigarettes, now 
one of the nation’s lowest at 33.9 cents, by $1 a pack. It also would add a $1 per ounce charge to tobacco products, ex-cept for small cigars that would be subject to the same tax as cigarettes.
Revenue generated from what supporters are calling a 
“surcharge” would go into the federal-state Medicaid program that covers the treatment of many people who become ill from smok-ing and other tobacco use.
“Tobacco ... has killed as many people as all of our wars 
combined,” said Sen. Ted Deutch, the sponsor. “While us-ing tobacco is absolutely a choice, the consequences of that 
choice should not be foisted upon the citizens of the state,” 
who help pay for the Medicaid program.
Deutch, D-Boca Raton, and other advocates say they 
hope the increase would discourage youngsters from tak-ing up smoking, and encourage people who already do to quit — even if that means less money for the state.
State economists have estimated the cigarette surcharge 
alone would bring in $871 million a year. No estimate has been made on how much the tax on other products would 
raise. That provision was a late addition announced Mon-
day by Deutch and Finance and Tax Committee Chairman Thad Altman, R-Viera.
The vote by Altman’s committee came only a day before 
the federal cigarette tax will increase by 62 cents to $1.01 a 
pack.Tobacco tax hiked

For the first time in 19 years, 
Gov. Charlie Crist opened up the 
Governor’s Mansion in Tallahas-
see for Florida Blue Key’s Legisla-
tive Day 2009.
More than 60 UF student lead-
ers visited the capital Tuesday to 
speak with representatives, sena-
tors and legislators about the im-
portance of higher education.
Crist encouraged a crowd of 
about 150 people, comprised of 
students, FBK alumni, legislators 
and UF President Bernie Machen, 
to continue their leadership in higher education.
In honor of FBK’s political ac-
tivism and involvement with the 
Florida Legislature, Crist signed a 
proclamation decreeing March 31, 2009, as Florida Blue Key Day.
Throughout the day, students 
met with several members of the 
Gator Caucus, a group of 54 mem-
bers of the House and Senate that defend budget cuts and other is-sues affecting UF.
Rep. Seth McKeel told them 
the Gator Caucus makes up a big portion of the House with a strong Blue Key connection.
“Everyone wants to be a part 
of the caucus when we win two national championships,” McKeel 
said. “But when we want to raise tuition, we lose some of our mem-
bers.”
The students questioned bud-
get cuts and decreases in research 
dollars to UF’s College of Medi-
cine, addressing nearly every rep-
resentative.
Many legislators commented 
about plans for making Florida 
Bright Futures more competitive 
and raising tuition through the 
Differential Tuition Plan so Florida 
colleges will reflect national aver-ages in tuition prices.
“It’s important to question your 
legislators now more than ever,” 
said Rep. John Tobia.
“Bright Futures is about to ex-
plode with lottery funding down, 
and if we don’t raise standards or 
water down benefits, we’re going 
to lose the best and brightest in 
Florida.”
Aron Weingard, president of 
FBK, said he wanted to show stu-
dents the rich tradition Blue Key 
has and show them the importance 
of the investment in higher educa-tion.
“We wanted to bring together 
the facets of student leaders and 
interact with our state’s most high-
est ranking officials,” Weingard said. “I think we did that today.”WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 9

LONDON — Desperate but di-
vided on ways to lift their nations 
from economic misery, world leaders converged for an emergency summit Tuesday holding scant hopes of find-
ing a magic-bullet solution for the 
crisis that brought them hurrying to London.
Even as President Barack Obama 
and the others were arriving, the U.S. acknowledged its allies would not go along with a massive burst of stimulus spending, while Europe was forced to backpedal from hopes for tighter fi-
nancial regulation.
Instead, leaders are trumpeting the 
limited common ground they could 
reach, including more money for the International Monetary Fund and clos-er scrutiny of hedge funds and tax ha-vens. As for the broader issues, they’re 
hoping for the best — or at least that 
they will do no harm.
With turbulent world markets 
watching closely, the stakes are high, especially for America’s new presi-dent, stepping onto the world stage for the first time to deal with the eco-nomic crisis and to meet face-to-face with many other leaders.
One global change is being ac-
knowledged: The forum for grappling 
with world economic problems has 
grown beyond the established eight post-war economies that dominated previous economic summits — the U.S., Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, Italy and Russia. Now, 20 na-tions are coming together in London, with fast-growing developing econo-
mies such as China, India, Brazil and 
Saudi Arabia — important players in any effort to coordinate economic policy — sitting as full negotiating partners.
“For the first time, there’s a recogni-
tion that major emerging markets and developing countries have a critical role at the table,” said Mike Froman, 
a White House international economic 
adviser.
But will that 
mean action to stop 
a global downward spiral?
Froman ac-
knowledged that there have been 
few examples of 
international gains 
in times of crisis. “The depression was made ‘great’ by the lack of coopera-tion,” he said, noting that nations like to keep control over their own fiscal and monetary policies.
And global leaders were quarreling 
up to the last minute before the sum-
mit.
Adding to the pressure, French 
President Nicolas Sarkozy said Tues-
day the leaders cannot afford to let the week pass without making sub-stantial progress in fixing the world’s economy.
“We have to obtain results, there is 
no choice, the crisis is too serious to al-
low us to have a summit for nothing,” 
he said.World leaders meet in

FRESNO, Calif. — In another food scare sure 
to rattle consumers who watched the national 
salmonella outbreak in peanuts unfold, federal food officials are now warning people not to eat any food containing pistachios, which could 
carry contamination from the same bacteria.
The Food and Drug Administration said cen-
tral California-based Setton Pistachio of Terra 
Bella Inc., the nation’s second-largest pistachio processor, was voluntarily recalling more than 2 million pounds of its roasted nuts shipped since last fall.
“Our advice to consumers is that they avoid 
eating pistachio products, and that they hold 
onto those products,” said Dr. David Acheson, 
assistant commissioner for food safety. “The number of products that are going to be recalled over the coming days will grow, simply because these pistachio nuts have then been repackaged into consumer-level containers.”
Two people called the FDA complaining 
of gastrointestinal illness that could be associ-ated with the nuts, but the link hasn’t been con-
firmed, Acheson said. Still, the plant decided to 
shut down late last week, officials said.
The recalled nuts represent a small fraction 
of the 55 million pounds of pistachios that the company’s plant processed last year and an even smaller portion of the 278 million pounds produced in the state in the 2008 season, accord-ing to the Fresno-based Administrative Com-mittee for Pistachios. California is the second-
largest producer of pistachios in the world.
According to the company’s Web site, Set-
ton Pistachio is in the corporate family of Com-
mack, N.Y.-based Setton International Foods Inc. The company sells nuts, dried fruit, edible seeds, chocolate and yogurt-coated candies.
The FDA learned about the problem last 
Tuesday, when Kraft Foods Inc. notified the agency that it had detected salmonella in roast-ed pistachios through routine product testing. Kraft and the Georgia Nut Co. recalled their Back to Nature Nantucket Blend trail mix the next day. The FDA contacted Setton Pistachio and California health officials shortly afterward, in what Acheson called a “proactive move.”
By Friday, grocery operator Kroger Co. re-
called one of its lines of bagged pistachios be-cause of possible salmonella contamination, 
saying the California plant also supplied its nuts. Those nuts were sold in 31 states.
Fabia D’Arienzo, a spokes-
woman for Setton Pistachio, said the company was only recalling certain bulk roasted in-shell and roasted shelled pistachios that were shipped on or after September 1.
Because Setton Pistachio shipped tote bags of 
nuts weighing up to 2,000 pounds to 36 whole-salers across the country, it will take weeks to figure out how many products could be affect-ed, said Jeff Farrar, chief of the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health.
“It will be safe to assume based on the vol-
ume that this will be an ingredient in a lot of dif-ferent products, and that may possibly include things like ice cream and cake mixes,” Farrar said. “The firm is already turning around trucks in transit to bring those back to the facility.”
Salmonella, the most common cause of food-
borne illness, is a bacteria that causes diarrhea, fever and cramping. Most people recover, but it can be life-threatening for children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.Salmonella found in nuts

CARTHAGE, N.C. — The nurse’s assistant who 
may have been the target of a deadly nursing home 
rampage in North Carolina survived by hiding in a bathroom inside a locked area for Alzheimer’s pa-tients, her mother said Tuesday.
Margaret Neal said her daughter Wanda is “dev-
astated” by the alleged actions of estranged husband Robert Stewart, who authorities believe killed seven residents and a nurse during Sunday’s attack.
She believes Stewart was after her daughter, who 
was safe behind the passcode-protected doors of the Alzheimer’s care unit at Pinelake Health and Rehab as he allegedly shot up the home’s hallways.
“She said she hid in the bathroom. She was close 
to him,” Neal said in an interview with The Associ-
ated Press. “The reason he didn’t 
get to her was because he didn’t know the code.”
Neal said her daughter left 
Stewart about a month ago and moved back to a home on the Neal family property, about half an hour from the site of the shootings in Carthage. 
She said Stewart had a tendency to grow violent, 
although Wanda usually kept quiet about the details of their marriage.
“He had a rage,” Neal said. “It would just ex-
plode over everything. He would be good and then something would just set him off.”
Authorities have said they are investigating 
whether Stewart’s rampage was “domestic-related.” Prosecutors have declined to comment more specifi-cally on a possible motive, but have said his actions were not a random act of violence.
Moore County Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Neil God-
frey said Tuesday that detectives have yet to com-plete a full interview with Stewart, a burly painter nicknamed “Pee Wee” by his hunting buddies. Stewart remains in a prison hospital. His wife is among the many witnesses who have been inter-viewed, but Godfrey declined to comment on what she told detectives.
“It would simply be speculation on the motive,” 
Godfrey said.NATIONAL

SAN’A, Yemen — A Dutch couple taken hostage Tuesday 
by armed tribesmen in Yemen said their kidnappers were 
treating them well, including offering them lunch and tea, af-ter brazenly hijacking their car in the capital.
Speaking by cell phone to The Associated Press from a vil-
lage where they were being held, Heleen Janszen said five men with Kalashnikov rifles surrounded their car while the couple was driving in the capital, San’a.
They forced her husband, Jan Hoogendoorn, 54, to move 
to the back seat and made both of them put on traditional Ye-meni clothing including a head scarf to escape the city unde-tected, she said.“It was a very classical kidnapping situation,” Janszen, 49, 
told the AP, talking on a phone that one of the kidnappers had allowed her to use. “We were offered lunch and tea, and were 
allowed to take a walk and take pictures. It’s such an adven-
ture — that’s the only way to cope with it.”
Yemeni tribes have previously seized 
foreigners — either tourists or those liv-ing or working in the country — to pres-
sure the Yemeni government to meet 
their demands, mainly to free clan mem-
bers from jail. In most cases, the kidnappings are resolved and the hostages freed unharmed.
Yemen, the most impoverished country in the Arabian 
Peninsula, is a U.S. ally in the Middle East, but — also — the 
ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, and al-Qaida loyal-
ists are active in the country.Stewart
NewsInternationalWEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11
� 78 PERCENT APPROVE.
By THOMAS STEWART

Seventy-eight percent of UF stu-
dents said they wanted it in a spring 
2007 referendum and now it’s inch-ing closer toward reality.
A bill in the state Legislature that 
would allow universities to charge a renewable energy fee, or “green” fee, unanimously passed two com-mittees, one in the House and one in the Senate, last week.
The bill would allow all 11 state 
universities to charge a fee of up to $5 per credit hour in the first year for environmentally friendly projects.
There is no limit on the fee after 
the first year. The Student Body of each university seeking to establish 
the fee would have to approve it 
with a student referendum detailing exactly how much the fee would be and what it would be spent on.
Even though UF students already 
voted in favor of a 50 cents-per-credit-hour fee in 2007, they would have to pass another referendum in order to make it official, according to an aide in the office of Sen. Lee Constantine, R-Altamonte Springs, a sponsor of the bill. 
The bill would also require uni-
versities that establish a fee to create a renewable energy fee committee to 
determine how the money is spent. 
Half the members would be ap-pointed by the university’s president or his or her designee and the other half by the Student Body president. They could only approve measures that establish or improve “the use of renewable energy technologies or energy efficiencies that directly low-er the university’s greenhouse gas emissions, waste, or energy costs,” according to the bill.
After five years with the fee, the 
students would have to vote on an-other referendum to decide if they 
want to keep it in place.
Sara Hutton, president of Gators 
for a Sustainable Campus, which put 
the last referendum on the Student Government elections ballot, said the group will try to hold another refer-endum for the fee in SG elections this fall. She said the group will proba-bly not be looking to increase the fee over the already-approved 50 cents.  
“We just don’t wanna make it too expensive for the student,” she said.
She said she’s glad the bill could 
be passed soon because budget cuts are threatening UF’s ability to fund 
environmental projects.
Students at Florida State Uni-
versity, the University of Central 
Florida and the University of South Florida have also voted in favor of a “green” fee.
STATEStudent referendum required to pass ‘green’ fee
By CHELSEA KEENAN

After debating, discussing and 
altering a bill for about three weeks, which will hold Student Govern-ment’s two lobbyists more account-able, senators finally voted and 
passed it unanimously.
The original bill, which sought to 
fire the lobbyists, was sent back to be 
reviewed because senators took issue with the fact that it offered no alterna-tives to fill the lobbyists’ spots.
The amended bill alters the lob-
byists’ contracts, requiring them to submit four written reports to Senate 
a year.  
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Ben 
Cavataro, who authored the bill, was 
excited to finally see it passed. 
“It feels great,” he said. “It’s been 
three weeks since we introduced the bill, and we finally pushed it through.”
Cavataro said he expects the new 
requirements to reveal to what use the lobbyists’ $55,000  salary is being put. He said information in the reports 
might include bills the lobbyists have worked on and the amount of time spent, as well as legislators they’ve spoken with. 
Earlier in the meeting, UF religion 
junior Jonny Gersten came by to urge senators to participate in a rally at noon on Tuesday on the Plaza of the  Americas.
The event, put on by Graduate 
Assistants United, UF’s Save Our Schools Coalition and the United Fac-ulty of Florida, is in response to the recent budget cuts affecting UF’s col-leges and administrative units. 
“We have the intention of reach-
ing the administration and state leg-islature,” he said. 
Gersten said there will be student 
and faculty speakers as well as oppor-tunities for students to write their leg-islator about the budget cuts.  Sena-tors also dished out  $319 to EnVeg, a student organization concerned with environmental sustainability, to pro-mote an Earth Day event they are co-sponsoring with Gators for a Sustain-
able Campus and Roots and Shoots.Senate passes lobbyist 
accountability billpossible cuts. In mid-April the proposals will be 
officially announced to the public and published on UF’s budget Web site.  This will usher in a period of public comment that lasts until mid-May, when UF President Bernie Machen must 
present the budget to the Board of Trustees for 
a final vote.
Details of the proposals for the colleges of 
Law, Pharmacy and Public Health and Health Professions were obtained Monday and Tues-day. The law college, which would have to cut about $2 million, would be spared any layoffs because its plan calls for the college to surrender about $600,000 in tuition money next year.
Since the college is graduate-only, it can 
charge all of its students extra tuition on top of state-set tuition. It will also use almost $600,000 of the differential tuition money to fund faculty positions currently funded by the state. Four vacant faculty and staff positions would be cut and one visiting lecturer position would not be renewed. Other cuts, such as those to operating expenses and library subscription fees, would possibly be funded by tuition money as well, 
said Dean Robert Jerry.
The College of Pharmacy’s proposal also 
avoids layoffs and academic program cuts by 
giving back differential tuition money to the tune of $1.2 million.
The College of Public Health and Health Pro-
fessions’ proposal includes a possible merger with the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences’ de-partment of Communication Sciences and Dis-
orders. Under the proposal, the college would 
cut $1.1 million from its own budget and almost $700,000 from CSD. The plan includes eight lay-offs, eliminates six vacant positions and would close the Rehab Counseling Division. Other cuts include those to operating costs and finding new sources of funding for faculty.
chose to cut the program because it is not as cen-tral to the college’s core mission as its four  de-partments. 
The institute also took a hit last May when its 
budget was cut by more than $175,000, accord-ing to Roberts. 
In order to keep the program afloat, Roberts 
said they dug into their foundation account, 
which is made up of money from film sales and 
alumni donations.
Roberts said pulled funding was vital for funding film projects, student travel and equip-ment needs. UF documentary film graduate stu-dent Peter Salmone said the college could use the Documentary Institute to help achieve its goal of including more digital media in its curriculum. 
“I know (the program is) expensive to run 
and doesn’t generate a lot of funding, but with the possibilities of new media you could see the money increase tenfold in the next few years,” he said.
“Everyone is suffering,” Salmone said. “We’re 
just the only department that got canned.”

JACKSONVILLE — The tying run was on second 
with one out and Daniel Pigott at the plate with a 
chance to win the game. 
When Pigott lined out in the fifth inning to FSU’s 
second baseman — who turned an unassisted double 
play, beating Jerico Weitzel to second base — No. 20 
UF did not expect that would be its last chance to hit against the Seminoles.
But during Pigott’s at-bat, rain started to come 
down, and the umpires delayed the game due to light-ning before the teams took the field in the sixth at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville.
The rain would only get harder, and the game end-
ed with the Seminoles (17-8) on top 3-2 after just five 
innings — the minimum amount of innings before a 
game is official.
“I didn’t know how much it was going to start rain-
ing,” freshman Preston Tucker said after Pigott’s fifth-inning at-bat. “I knew the umpires were going to call it for a little bit, but I had no idea it was going to be this bad.”
FSU’s Jack Posey cranked a 3-2 pitch deep over the 
left-field fence to start the fifth inning against UF pitch-
er Alex Panteliodis (2-3, 4.31 ERA), giving the Semi-
noles their margin of victory.
The blast came one inning after Tucker shot a hard-
hit ground ball that FSU’s third baseman couldn’t han-dle, bringing in Buddy Munroe and Avery Barnes to tie the game at 2. 
UF (18-9, 6-3 Southeastern Conference) was forced 
to battle back after a rough first inning by starter Ste-phen Locke.UF BASEBALLRain gives UF no chance for late-game comeback
Starters not lasting long
Maybe you’re already making 
travel plans to Pasadena, Calif., for next January. I don’t blame 
you. All signs point to the Gators playing for their third national championship in four years — and probably winning it. 
And while we can all pencil in 189 Tim 
Tebow runs up the middle and 57 Bran-don Spikes crushing tackles, a lot of other players are going to make the difference in UF having another University Avenue 
celebration or a teary Tebow and Urban 
Meyer wondering what went wrong.
So here are some areas of concern this 
spring and the players who are going to be counted on to step up:• Meyer hasn’t given out the No. 1 jersey yet despite several players asking for it, and there’s good reason for that. The ar-gument could be made that several players will end up being the Gators’ No. 1 receiver next year, and that per-son might get Har-vin’s No. 1 jersey. The logical guesses are either Deonte 
Thompson or Aaron Hernandez. They’re 
the big names. If you want a sleeper to 
take the reigns of the receiving group, look out for Carl Moore. He had a frus-trating first year, but he has as much tal-ent as anybody. Also, don’t forget about senior David Nelson and incoming fresh-man Andre Debose, who Meyer is expect-

JACKSONVILLE — When the rain 
clouds settled over the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville, finalizing a 3-2 five-inning loss for UF at the hands of rival FSU, the Gators’ recent propensity for slow starts became magnified as the last four innings were washed away. 
UF (18-9) has mounted four come-
from-behind wins in its last seven games, but Mother Nature didn’t give the No. 20 Gators enough time to make it five out of the last eight. 
“We’ve proven we can come back 
from any deficit,” said freshman Preston Tucker, who was instrumental in a sev-en-run ninth inning comeback against Alabama. “Unfortunately, we didn’t have a chance to do that tonight.”
Though Tuesday night’s loss was 
only UF’s second in its last 11 contests, the starting rotation has had a tough time eating any significant amount of in-nings for the pitching staff.
Senior Stephen Locke started the 
game for the Gators, and just seven outs later, he took a seat in the first-base dug-out to watch the rest of the game. The 2 1/3 innings were actually 1/3 of an inning longer than he was able to last on March 25 when he made his first ap-pearance of the season after rejoining the team.
While Locke’s short stints have been 
a result of a predetermined pitch count, the rest of the rotation can’t make the same excuse. Over the last eight games, the Gators have received an average of WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 19

UF commit Kenny Boynton takes part in the 3-point Competition at the 
McDonald’s  All-American Game in Coral Gables on Monday night.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
CORAL GABLES — Kenny 
Boynton casually leaned against 
the wall as reporters and micro-phones surrounded him. An out-
side observer might have thought 
he was a politician if not for the 
red gym shorts sagging past the 
top of his calves.
Later, while sitting at a table, 
dipping his McNuggets in bar-becue sauce, a man shoved a lap-top in front of Boynton. A video 
was playing, showing a montage 
of Boynton’s steals, dunks and 
3-pointers.
“I got so much footage of you, 
man,” the laptop-wielder gushed.
Another player laughed when 
footage from Boynton’s junior sea-son appeared in the highlights.
“Check out Kenny with the 
braids!” he said.
Boynton, now with short hair, 
just smiled.
The high school senior guard 
and UF commit received as much 
attention as any player at Tues-
day’s media day for McDonald’s 
All-American Game, which will be played tonight. 
Part of it was the fact he was 
the local kid, a shooting guard 
from American Heritage Plan-
tation High and the first player from Broward County to become an All-American.But another reason for Boyn-
ton’s draw was the oddity of his situation. He is a basketball star in a football hotbed. Broward 
County produces talent like Ma-
jor Wright, not stars on the hard-wood.
When he steps onto the UF 
campus this fall, Boynton will 
resume his role of basketball star 
in an area infested with athletic freaks in cleats. He is the No. 7 
player on Rivals.com and the first 
top-10 player to commit to UF since the Web site began ranking its top 100 players in 2001.
Boynton knows what he needs 
to bring with him next year.
“Intensity and attacking the 
rim, I think that will give Florida 
wins,” Boynton said. “They have 
the skills and all, they just relied 
on their outside shot a lot (last 
season).”
The Gators missed the NCAA 
Tournament the last two seasons, 
and the O’Connell Center has not 
been full, a far cry from when stu-
dents camped out the night before 
games during UF’s back-to-back 
championships run.
Boynton hopes he will have a 
chance to start in the backcourt alongside point guard Nick Ca-
lathes. Calathes — who also 
played in the McDonald’s game 
in 2007 — declared for the NBA Draft on Monday, but did not hire an agent, maintaining his eligi-bility should he decide he is not ready for the pros.
“I hope he does make it (to the 
NBA),” Boynton said. “But if he 
does come back, I know we’ll do 
good next year. (Calathes) knows when to make the right play, he 
knows when to take the right 
shot, make the right pass. … He 
has a very high basketball IQ.”
Calathes’ departure would 
not impact Boynton’s future as a Gator. 
However, if coach Billy Dono-
van had accepted the head coach-
ing position at Kentucky, Boynton might have left with him.
While Boynton signed a letter 
of intent to play at UF on Oct. 30, the contract could be nullified if 
Donovan left.
“Usually players get released 
(from their letters of intent) be-cause it looks bad for a school that 
is not letting the kid go. It hinders 
their ability to recruit in the fu-
ture,” Rivals.com recruiting ana-
lyst Jerry Meyer said.
Donovan contacted Boynton’s 
family after the Kentucky rumors 
spread to ensure them he was 
staying in Gainesville.
“Billy called my mom two 
nights later and explained to her the situation and that he basically 
said no,” Boynton said.
And if Donovan had left?
“I’m not sure. I doubt I’d stay, 
though.”UF MEN’S BASKETBALLGators commit Boynton ready to play in ’09-’10
With runners on first and second in the first inning, 
FSU’s Stuart Tapley flied out to Matt den Dekker, but 
den Dekker’s throw to get the runner attempting to tag up at third got by Weitzel, allowing the first run to score for FSU. A sacrifice fly from Jason Stidham would 
give the Seminoles a 2-run advantage after one inning.
The weather-shortened game didn’t give the Gators 
much time to stage a comeback, something they were 
able to do in two of their three games last weekend against Alabama, but they squandered their chances to score early in the game.
“We had our opportunities, and we didn’t do it, 
simple as that,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.  
Locke wouldn’t allow another run, but he got in 
trouble again in the third inning with one out and was bailed out by reliever Greg Larson, who made the in-ning’s second out by nailing Stephen Cardullo at home 
on a squeeze attempt.
Some of the 6,251 fans stayed 30 minutes after the 
game was delayed until it was officially called, having 
to leave the Baseball Grounds disappointed with the early finish.
Even FSU coach Mike Martin was upset to see the 
rivalry game end before a full nine innings.
“It’s disappointing we were not able to play nine 
innings of baseball,” Martin said. “This was a great 
venue, a great night to play baseball.”
The FSU win tied the season series at 1. The Gators 
took the first game in Gainesville on a walk-off single 
by Buddy Munroe. The series will be decided on April 14 in Tallahassee.
UF will get a chance to redeem the loss tonight in 
Gainesville against Stetson.Shortened game disappoints both sides
O’Sullivan may shake up Gators’ rotationing to be the next Percy Harvin.
• Should John Brantley really be the future at quarterback? UF doesn’t have a difficult schedule this season, and that means there will be plenty of blowouts. So you know Brant-
ley is going to get plenty of snaps, more than last season.
Following Tebow will be one of the most difficult jobs for 
anybody in sports in a long time. Will he show glimpses of 
being the type of signal-caller who can lead a team to cham-
pionships? An injured Tebow is the only thing that could 
keep UF from Pasadena this year, and even a healthy Tebow 
will need breathers. Brantley needs to have an impact simi-lar to what Tebow did his freshman year. This will be his third year on campus, and it’s time for him to show why he was one of the highest-rated quarterbacks in his class.
• Besides Debose, will any freshmen make a significant im-pact? Yes, the Gators have absurd talent coming in again, but it’s talent at places that are loaded with depth. Does Meyer 
really want to waste a year on safety Dee Finley or lineback-
er Jelani Jenkins when the Gators have Ahmad Black, Major Wright, Will Hill and Dorian Munroe in front of Finley on the depth chart? How about a linebacker corps that already has Spikes, Dustin Doe, A.J. Jones, Ryan Stamper, Brandon Hicks, Brendan Beal and Lerentee McCray? When someone as good as Jenkins comes along, it’s hard to waste a year of eligibility when he’s almost destined to be a backup. Most teams would love two high-caliber starting safeties. The Gators have four. Finley will make an impact on special 
teams — at most. 
The best bet for a freshman to make an impact may be 
tight end Desmond Parks because, well, the Gators don’t 
have anybody at tight end but Hernandez. The sleeper could be defensive tackle Gary Brown if he outplays Jaye Howard and Omar Hunter once he gets there. But good luck with that.BRIAN , from page 18 BASEBALL , from page 18

Baseball3 innings from their starters, with 
the longest outing — five innings — coming from freshman Anthony DeSclafani against North Florida.
The last time a UF starter last-
ed longer than five innings was against Tennessee on March 20 when junior Jeff Barfield threw 6 2/3 innings in a 3-2 win. Freshman Greg Larson, who made his fifth re-lief appearance in this eight-game stretch, took over for Locke with one out in the third inning against FSU (17-8) and kept both of his in-herited runners from scoring. The next inning, however, he 
worked into a bases-loaded jam, and UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan had to go to Alex Panteliodis to get out of the inning. 
“I never 
should’ve had to go to A.P. in that in-ning,”  O’Sullivan said. 
In the fifth and 
final inning, Jack 
Posey’s mammoth solo home run put the Seminoles out in front yet again, and the Gators knew they didn’t have much time to respond.
“We had a team meeting before (the fifth inning) started,” Tucker said. “We knew we had to string some hits together and score some runs.”
After UF squandered a leadoff 
single by Jerico Weitzel, any hopes of a comeback disappeared along with the red infield clay, which the grounds crew immediately cov-ered up with a white tarp. 
The Gators have been more 
about the finish than the start as of late, but O’Sullivan has said he may have to shake up the strug-gling starting rotation heading into the heart of Southeastern Con-ference play.20, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 2009

The UF softball team isn’t used 
to losing.
The Gators (34-3, 13-1 Southeast-
ern Conference) are 104-8 in the last 
two years, and they have not lost 
back-to-back games in that span. 
After dropping Game 3 of its 
series against No. 5 Alabama on 
Sunday, No. 1 UF will hit the road to take on Auburn (25-10, 5-4 SEC) in Auburn, Ala., in a doubleheader starting at 5 p.m.
“It was a tough loss,” pitcher 
Stacey Nelson said of the series fi-
nale against Alabama. “In the past 
couple years, we’re not accustomed to losses.”
If last year was any indication, 
however, the Gators might not experience a similar defeat for the rest of the conference season. UF finished 27-1 in SEC play last sea-son after a 1-0 loss to Alabama on 
March 12, 2008, the team’s fourth 
conference game of the year.
After that setback, UF reeled off 
37 straight wins. With their first conference loss of this season now behind them, the Gators are look-ing to match their success from last year.
“We’re a great team. We’re go-
ing to bounce back,” catcher Kris-tina Hilberth said. “We’ve got to take care of Auburn, and we’re just hopefully going to get better and start a new winning streak on Wednesday.”
To get the new streak started, 
UF will have to play better defense than it did in Sunday’s loss. The Gators were outstanding defen-
sively in their two wins against the 
Crimson Tide on Saturday, as they committed no errors, allowed only 2 runs on the day and worked out of two bases-loaded situations.
UF recorded two errors in Sun-
day’s loss alone — an uncharacter-istic statistic for a team that has just 20 errors through 37 games. In ad-
dition to the two errors, the Gators 
missed several more opportunities in the field that could have swung the momentum of the game.
“We just didn’t play defense like 
we can and like we needed to,” Hil-berth said. “We had two errors, but if you think about the mistakes that we made, there was much more 
than two mistakes. That’s just what 
goes down in the books.”
UF coach Tim Walton echoed 
his catcher’s sentiment, adding that his team did not capitalize on the opportunities it had in the first 6 1/2 innings.  
“We didn’t make plays,” Wal-
ton said. “We didn’t do a very good 
job on defense. Ultimately, defense 
wins championships and wins ball games for you, but we just didn’t make plays.”
Walton added that he was hap-
py with the poise and composure his team displayed at the plate in its rally in the bottom of the seventh against the Tide, and his hitters will need to continue at that pace against the Tigers today.
Although they are not on the 
same level as Alabama’s Kelsi 
Dunne, who struck out 13 batters 
Sunday, Auburn has two starting pitchers who allow fewer than 2 earned runs per game.
Junior Anna Thompson (12-6, 
1.45 ERA) and freshman Jenee Loree (10-3, 1.94 ERA) will likely start a game each against the Gators. 
“They’re good. They’ve got 
good pitching, and when you have good pitching, you’re always in the ballgame,” Walton said. “So we’re going to have to do a good job mak-ing adjustments.”
WORDS INSPIRE GYMNASTS: De-
sire. Phenomenal. Believe. Heart.
What may seem like a random 
collection of words has a much 
deeper meaning to the UF gymnas-
tics team. Those are just four of the 
dozens of words the team has cho-sen for its “Word of the Day.”Each practice day, a different 
gymnast — organized by height — picks a quote and a word that usually goes along with the quote. Sometimes the gymnasts will give a speech about the word and quote 
with the goal of inspiring the team. 
The tradition is capped off with the whole team doing one Gator chomp as gymnasts yell the word before practice.
“It’s your time to shine,” senior 
Corey Hartung said. “Your time to say what’s on your mind and say the positive things that you want to 
say to influence your team.”
Hartung said she searches on-
line the night before her day for a 
quote that means a lot to her. 
She saves quotes she likes and 
even has a file on her computer serving as a compilation of some of her favorites.
While the word of the day usu-
ally serves to inspire, sometimes a gymnast will say a more lightheart-ed, jovial word, reflecting how the team is feeling.
At the Southeastern Conference 
Championships, the word was “phenomenal.” Hartung picked the word in an effort to find a more unique and less cliché word.
Faehn said the word carried 
through the whole weekend of the competition, as is the case with any word picked on any given week-end.
Following the SEC Champion-
ships, “phenomenal” even made it through to press releases.
Junior Ashley Kerr, who has 
used “believe” as her word a few times, said “heart” has been one of her favorite words this year, syn-onymous with the team’s motto, “A 
Team Beats with One Heart.”
“This year, especially just with all 
the adversity we’ve gone through, 
this team has put their heart, espe-cially at SECs, everybody put their heart out there,” Kerr said.
Kerr said she usually picks her 
word after gauging how the team is feeling or if she feels her word 
touches her or her teammates.
Maranda Smith, who always 
gives a quote followed by a speech, 
sees her day as an opportunity to shine as a leader.
Earlier this year, her word was 
“oomph.”
“The difference between try and 
triumph is a little oomph,” Smith 
said.
Even coaches aren’t exempt 
from the “Word of the Day.” Sun-
day is coaches’ day.
“I always like to pick quotes that 
are about hard work, the positives, the mental aspect,” Faehn said. 
One Sunday, Faehn’s word was 
“Noah,” after her son, whom she 
brought to the gym.
“I wanted to make it light that 
day,” Faehn said. “There’s little 
Noah. He’s going to run around and it brings a smile to (the gym-
nasts’) face.”
