In Blues Creek, a north Gainesville 
neighborhood, four people stood in the 
front yard of Evelyn and Lecreth Baker’s house Tuesday afternoon.
They talked about what happened three 
doors down the night before, because, re-ally, there was nothing else to talk about.
Gainesville Police gave an account of 
what happened Monday night:
Late in the evening, Austin M. Jones, 
22, and his cousin, Maranda J. Martin, 22, 
donned masks and broke into 78-year-old 
Paul D. Quandt’s house at 4854 NW 75th Road. They came prepared with two rolls of tape, a stun gun and two pistols. Martin used to work for a health-care service that 
provided aid to Quandt, and she knew he 
had a safe in the house. The pair demanded the combination. When Quandt, a military veteran, refused, his hands were taped and he was shot with a stun gun. 
Then he was beaten and stabbed.Quandt was in critical condition Tues-
day night, police said.
Quandt’s status was unknown as of 
press time. The charges against Martin and Jones are listed as ﬁ  rst-degree murder  as of late Tuesday night, according to the Ala-chua County Jail website.
Neighbors were surprised at the brutal-
ity of the crime.
“Nothing like this happens in Blues 
Creek,” Jack Alter said, who had gone on 
a walk Tuesday afternoon before stopping 
to talk about the case with some neighbors. 
“It’s pretty quiet here.”
“As close as we lived, we never heard a 
thing,” Evelyn Baker said. “Not a thing.”
Jones and Martin took the safe — with 
more than $20,000 worth of gold, silver, 
ﬁ  rearms, currency and electronics in it — and put it in the trunk of Quandt’s white Cadillac. Jones then drove off in the Cadil-
lac, according to GPD spokeswoman Cpl. Home invasion suspects in custody

UF Student Senate gave its preliminary 
approval to Student Government election 
code revisions at Tuesday night’s meet-ing. 
A majority of the senators voted to ap-
prove the changes, although several sena-tors said the new rules need to be revised. 
“I do have issues with it,” said Unite 
Party spokeswoman Sen. Christina Bonar-
rigo. “But I do believe these need to be 
passed in a timely matter.” 
The election codes 
need to be passed six 
weeks before the spring 
elections for the changes 
to apply. Elections are 
scheduled for Feb. 21 and Feb. 22.
Some students who 
voted in the fall elec-
tions were listed with 
the wrong location-based district. Students 
whose home addresses rather than their school addresses were registered with the 
university were placed in the district for 
commuter students. 
Under the changes proposed by the 
election codes revision committee, the su-
pervisor of elections would no longer be 
required to provide a map listing at each 
polling location. Currently, he or she is re-
quired to make a sample ballot and a map SG votes on 
revisions to election code

One of the ﬁ  ve people who let 
down Central Florida in 2011 is on 
UF’s payroll.
In a Jan. 7 editorial, the Or-
lando Sentinel named ﬁ  ve people 
who “squandered or misused 
their positions of power through selﬁ  shness, mismanagement or corruption.”
Florida Senate President Mike 
Haridopolos (R-Merritt Island) made the list.
Haridopolos teaches political 
science courses on campus dur-ing the Fall semester and instructs students who participate in a Tal-
lahassee internship during the leg-islative session in the spring.
UF pays him $75,000 a year, 
according to records from the Of-
ﬁ  ce of Institutional Planning and Research.
In November, Haridopolos ad-
mitted he lied to a Miami Herald reporter in April 2010 when he denied knowing about a secret 
settlement agreement with former Republican Party of Florida Chair-
man Jim Greer. 
Also in 2010, Haridopolos was 
found guilty of an ethics violation for failing to properly complete his ﬁ  nancial disclosure forms.
On Tuesday, the ﬁ  rst day of 
the legislative session, the Miami Herald published Haridopolos’ 
rebuttal to a Herald editorial that decried his actions.
“I, too, regret these mistakes, 
but as you read through each 
one, I hope you see that each of these was just that  a mistake,” he wrote.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said Haridopolos’ political behav-ior has no effect on his teaching status because UF evaluates its 
employees based on their work 
with students. Newspaper: Central Florida ‘let down’ by UF professor, state senatorBonarrigo

TSA defends confiscation of 
Mass. woman’s cupcake 
PEABODY, Mass.  —  The fed-
eral Transportation Security Ad-
ministration is defending its deci-sion to confiscate a frosted cupcake from a Massachusetts woman fly-
ing from Las Vegas.
The TSA says in a blog com-
ment posted Monday the cupcake 
was packed in a jar filled with ic-ing, which is considered a gel ac-cording to a policy designed to secure travelers from terrorists seeking to evade detection by us-ing explosives made of plastics, 
liquids or gels.
Peabody (PEE’-buh-dee) resi-ceremony surrounding Gov. Rick 
Scott’s State of the State address.
He blamed lawmakers, includ-
ing himself, for contributing to the problems by promoting parochial interests of their local schools at the expense of the entire system.
Senate President Mike Harido-
polos stressed the importance of balancing the budget in his open-ing remarks. Lawmakers are fac-ing a potential $2 billion shortfall.
Scott, Haridopolos and Cannon 
agree the budget must be balanced without raising taxes and fees. The Republican governor, though, told lawmakers he “just cannot bud-get” on his recommendation to increase education spending by $1 billion.
In his address, Scott mostly 
stuck to the familiar theme of cut-ting taxes and red tape for busi-nesses in the belief that it will ex-pand Florida’s economy and create jobs in a state where 10 percent of workers remain unemployed, al-though that’s 2 percentage points less than a year ago.
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSdent Rebecca Hains was barred from taking her cupcake onto a plane last month when a TSA 
agent said icing in the jar ex-
ceeded amounts of gels allowed in carry-on luggage. Hains has called that “terrible logic.”
The TSA says travelers can 
take cakes, pies and cupcakes through security checkpoints but should expect they might get ad-ditional screening.

After a year of international 
social movements, Time maga-
zine chose The Protester as its 
Person of the Year.
Protesters in Gainesville, in-
cluding members of Occupy 
Gainesville, Students for a Dem-
ocratic Society and Fight Back 
Florida, hope to continue their momentum from last year and keep bringing attention to their causes.
Occupy Gainesville is still us-
ing Bo Diddley Community Plaza as a headquarters for its occupa-tion. 
It is looking to focus on fore-
closure issues in the community.
Students for a Democratic 
Society have not introduced its plans to continue advocacy for 
the upcoming year, but plans to 
do so in the coming week.
Fight Back Florida, a group started in March in response to Gov. Rick Scott’s budget cuts, is trying to repeal Scott’s policies.
Kenzie Cooke, a 20-year-old 
Occupy Gainesville member, said she hopes Time magazine’s announcement, which was pub-lished Dec. 14, will inspire those on the fence about participating in the Occupy Movement to join.
“My main focus is to help stu-
dent, activist and minority groups come together through the Occupy 
Movement and beyond,” Cooke said.
She said Occupy Gainesville 
will work on advocating for fore-
closure reform.“This isn’t the first time the 99 
percent has addressed consump-
tion wealth in America,” she 
said. “These issues protesters are involved with aren’t new.”
Skye Schmelzer, a 19-year-old 
UF psychology sophomore, said it meant a lot to her that the mag-azine deemed The Protester as the person who had the greatest impact during the year.
“It showed that Time maga-
zine, a prime source of entertain-ment, believed in activists,” said Schmelzer, a member of Students 
for a Democratic Society at UF.
Last year, the student organi-
zation started an anti-tuition hike 
movement, but it will be putting its efforts elsewhere this semes-
ter. 
Schmelzer said she didn’t 
know the organization’s official 
plans at the moment.
Fight Back Florida plans to 
continue pushing against Scott’s policies.
Dave Schneider, a 21-year-old 
recent UF graduate and state-
wide organizer of Fight Back 
Florida, said he is continuing his activism after graduating and is working to fight against Scott’s 
budget cuts in Tallahassee now 
that the state legislative session has started.
“What we want is for working 
people to rule society again,” he 
said.

Results from a UF research project on young plants 
might help make the nation’s agriculture more fer -
tile.
A UF research team set out more than 10 years ago 
to study the chromosomes of a Northwest plant spe-
cies. During the process, the team discovered its re-search may help reduce issues with plants that have a 
hard time reproducing.
Lead author and UF postdoctoral researcher Mi-
chael Chester said the research team studied the 
changing chromosomes in a plant species that formed in the last century — a veritable baby in plant terms.
He said the research team, led by the Florida Mu-
seum of Natural History’s Pam Soltis, did not set out to impact agriculture research.
Chester and the research team studied polyploidy, 
which is a process during which chromosomes multi-ply. According to a UF news release, the researchers studied about 70 Tragopogon miscellus plants, which are flower variations.
Polyploidy can inhibit the plants’ ability to repro-
duce, and it’s common in many important agricultur -
al crops in the U.S., including coffee, corn and apples, according to the news release.
The research might explain why some agricultural 
plant varieties are infertile, Chester said.
He said the research has not yet been applied to 
agriculture.
Research like this is what keeps UF faculty on top 
of the latest innovations, said Win Phillips, senior 
vice president and chief operating officer for UF’s Of-
fice of Research.
If UF didn’t emphasize research, he said, “then we 
would simply keep repeating the same stuff.”4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 11, 2012

To commemorate the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King 
Jr., a UF committee will spend the rest of January highlighting 
his core values.
The UF MLK Celebration Steering Committee, in collabora-
tion with UF Multicultural & Diversity Affairs, will kick off its fifth-annual UF MLK Celebration on Monday.
The month will include a talk by Danny Glover, activist 
and actor. His talk, “A Night with Danny Glover,” will be Jan. 25 at 7 p.m. at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
About 40 student organizations and academic departments 
will be involved in this year’s celebration, including the Afri-can American Studies Program, GatorNights! and the Office of the Provost, said Jarrod Cruz, chairman of the MLK Celebra-tion Steering Committee.
The campuswide celebration will end Jan. 31. All events are free and open to the public, with the excep-
tion of a trip to Atlanta.
“We want to give students the opportunity to see how they 
will be leaving their legacy at the university and see how they will be making the greatest impact,” Cruz said.Fifth-annual UF

For Dylan Fisher, buying textbooks be-
comes a treasure hunt.
When the UF exploratory freshman dis-
covered he needed five textbooks for the 
spring semester, he set out to find the magic 
combination of new, used and rental books 
that would reduce the damage to his wallet.
“I’m going from Amazon to Neebo trying 
to strategize how to get the cheapest text-books,” said Fisher, 18.
His search is common for college stu-
dents. 
But comparing prices should not be that 
hard, said UF alumnus Steven Kennedy in 
an email.
That’s why Kennedy, 26, started work on 
Textbooks.org, a website that compares text-
book prices for free.
“I thought that there had to be a better 
way to do it, and I finally took the initiative to create a website that would help students save time and money,” he said.
Kennedy said about 7,000 people have 
visited the site to compare prices on nearly 5,000 books since its launch in December.
The site compares prices for more than 30 
online merchants, he said.After a student types in a book’s title or 
ISBN, the website compares its prices from textbook sellers such as Amazon, Half.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
It then displays a list of the lowest prices 
for new, used and rental textbooks, includ-ing e-books and international editions.
The results are sorted from the cheapest 
overall price — the cost of the book plus ship-ping — to the highest. Users can then click through to the vendors’ websites to purchase their books.
In addition, the website has blog posts 
describing where to find cheap textbooks at various colleges. These entries give in-formation about alternatives to university 
bookstores. For example, UF’s post mentions 
Orange and Blue Textbooks and the Florida Book Store.
Students can also search to see how much 
each merchant would pay to buy back their used textbooks.
“I’ve heard from several students and 
teachers who are excited about how useful the site is,” Kennedy said.
Fisher ended up spending about $150 on 
books this semester, but he said he will defi-nitely use Textbooks.org in the future.
“You’re searching to find the most minis-
cule ways to save money,” he said.Textbook site compares prices
� GEORGIA O’KEEFFE’S        
‘AUSTRIAN COPPER ROSE IV’ IS ONE OF THE 12 WORKS.
KELLY PRICE
Alligator Contributing Writer
While most UF students were home 
for winter break chomping on candy 
canes and scoring last-minute holi-day deals, the Harn Museum of Art debuted a new exhibit highlighting female artists.
“Women of Art and Science” is a 
part of the works-on-paper section within the museum’s modern col-lection, said Amelia Bell, a museum spokeswoman.
Georgia O’Keeffe’s “Austrian Cop-
per Rose IV” inspired museum curator Dulce Roman to acquire the other 11 works. She said she was drawn to the botanical subjects and flower prints. The exhibit’s feminine focus was trig-
gered by the large library of female 
artists famous for botanical paintings 
in history.
“Georgia O’Keeffe has always 
sat alone in galleries,” she said. “So 
I thought this was an interesting ap-
proach to complement [the paint-
ing].”
The exhibit is scheduled to be on 
display until mid-June, Roman said. 
However, it might stay up until Sum-
mer B, depending on whether the mu-
seum’s focus changes.
The pieces in “Women of Art and 
Science” are part of the larger works-
on-paper modern art collection of 
about 300 pieces from between the 
Renaissance and 1850 acquired by the 
Harn Museum.Harn Museum exhibit to

Today’s question: Do you think the Student Senate has 
done enough to improve the election process?
44 TOTAL VOTES18% YES
82% NOFriday’s question: Do you donate blood regularly? Students: Diversify your social lives
Before and during college, students are bombarded with advice from all directions by all people, some of it obvious, some intriguing but not fully clear 
and some brushed off like an insignificant fly. But there is one consistent piece of advice that is practiced at some point in every meaningful life. I’ve heard it from gradu-ates of state schools and Ivy Leagues alike: Be open to new people and to different experiences.
The advice is clear, but sometimes the simplest advice 
is practiced incorrectly. The confused teenager with an eager heart, having heard during high school the defeat-ed idea that college will be the best time of his or her life, with the impossible, barely perceptible fear of four years of solitude, rushes and joins a Greek  organization.
Let me be clear: There is nothing inherently wrong 
with joining a Greek organization, nor do I argue against joining one. In fact, it’s clear that fraternities and sorori-ties have many benefits. They bring friends, opportuni-ties and connections. But a step in the right direction — a step toward being open, meeting people and forming meaningful relationships — often leads to many steps toward antagonism, egoism and restrictiveness. 
Students should avoid confining themselves to any 
single social organization, particularly a social fraternal organization. Greek life can consume a student’s life and cause him or her to form an obsession with only one or -
ganization and its counterpart fraternities or sororities. Instead of diversifying their experiences and the types of people with they interact with, students consumed by Greek life feel antagonistic toward rival fraternities and sororities as well as other students. Relationships out-side their confines can become insincere, short-lived and based on malevolent motives.
Both the individual and the university suffer when 
students center their lives on social fraternal organiza-tions. Jokes about rival organizations and GDIs might seem to be in good humor, but they represent a more fundamental issue associated with the Greek lifestyle: the tendency to antagonize others, both Greek and non-Greek. This antagonism is anti-intellectual and not productive to higher education. We can see the ef-fect of this antagonism on UF as a whole when considering the Greek system’s attempt to mo-
nopolize UF politics through the Unite Party.
Though not always the case, I have too often witnessed 
the sad situation of students becoming engrossed with the Greek lifestyle, falling into a mindset that debilitates them once they receive their degree and they enter a new chapter of their lives. Without sounding like an anti-drug campaign, I have had friends, obsessed with Greek life, expelled from UF for low grades, a direct result of their time-draining obsession.
Finding a community during college is important for 
a healthy and happy mind, but so is remaining open to diverse experiences and people. Perhaps the most re-warding part of the university experience is the ability to connect with thousands of intelligent students, most of whom have very different beliefs, practices and ideas. 
If a student joins a social fraternal organization and 
does not allow it and its members to become his or her life, then that student has benefited twofold. But when students finds their lives revolving around a Greek orga-nization that hampers their ability to engage in new ex-periences and with people not so similar to themselves, they should consider what the organization actually stands for, if that lifestyle is in harmony with their ideas and if that obsession is the best way to dedicate their youthful, capable, brilliant years.

College paper adviser 
didn’t deserve firing
In college, students have many opportunities to practice a lot 
of the same things they would be doing in the real world.
For instance, students have the chance to work with bud-
gets, plan meetings or promote their causes as board members 
in various student organizations. If they mess up in these posi-tions, their careers are not finished and their lives are generally 
not ruined. The college setting provides them with the chance to 
learn from their mistakes. 
This was not the case in a recent incident at East Carolina 
University.
Two months ago, the East Carolinian, an independent, stu-
dent-run newspaper, ran uncensored photos of a streaker who was arrested at a football game on its front page. 
Needless to say, this photo caused a lot of controversy around 
the community and received criticisms from university officials. 
While we agree with the ECU administration’s conclusion 
that running this photo on the front page might have been “in very poor taste,” the administration’s proceeding actions were 
inappropriate.  
A few weeks after this photo ran, Student Media Adviser 
Paul Isom, who oversaw and advised the school’s newspaper, radio station and other publications, was dismissed from this 
position.
Fortunately , the Alligator is completely independent from 
UF. But this also means we bear even more responsibility for our 
actions, a situation we wholeheartedly accept. 
Student editors should not have to worry about facing nega-
tive repercussions from their respective institutions from either 
a practical or a legal perspective. 
As we have said, students should be able to learn from their 
mistakes while they have the opportunity. Isom could have used this incident as a powerful teaching moment for the staff of the 
East Carolinian. Instead, the ECU administration may have cre-
ated a chilling effect for current and future editors at that paper 
as well as for student editors across the country . 
From a legal standpoint, advisers to student-run newspapers 
usually are not day-to-day players in what goes in the paper. Instead, they serve to offer suggestions and criticisms after the 
fact. It would not have been his job to okay a decision to run the nude photos in the first place. 
Also, considering that ECU is a public institution, all of its 
publications should be subject to First Amendment protection. 
The ECU administration said in a statement that its decision 
to fire Isom was a “personnel matter” and not a First Amend-ment issue. The only thing Isom was told was that it “wanted to 
move in a different direction.” 
The fact that the administration is hiding behind this nonsen-
sical reason makes this situation even worse. It knows that if it 
admits that it is firing him because of the pictures, he will actu-ally be able to bring up his First Amendment protections.

UF shouldn’t ignore growing 
vegan population
While we were gone for 
winter break, the percentage of Gators who support UF’s smart, 
ethical and sustainable transi-
tion to a Meatless Monday in its two dining halls grew to 10 percent.                     
About 5,000 people, more 
than the entire population of the 
city of Newberry to our north, 
now support the growing trend to leave flesh off our plates on Mondays.             
And it’s not surprising.             
The Philadelphia Inquirer 
released a report in October that 
found 12 percent of college stu-dents now identify as vegetarian 
or vegan.          
Even in Gainesville, a city that 
birthed Sonny’s BBQ and where 
the scents of pig manure mingle across the highway, our univer -
sity was named the second most 
vegan-friendly university in the 
nation.   
It’s time for UF to realize that 
Gators, like the rest of the world, know that a reduced-meat diet lowers one’s carbon footprint enormously, helps end the suf-fering of billions of animals 
every year and decreases one’s 
risk of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, 
stroke, many forms of cancer and heart disease.  
While there will always be a 
select few Gators who ardently oppose a transition to a Meatless Monday — even if a switch to offering vegan jambalaya rather than baked chicken in two din-
ing halls on campus will never 
affect them — 10 percent is a difficult number with which to argue.           
It’s time for UF and Gator 
Dining Services to realize that this is something a growing majority of students actually want, rather than a simple, dis-
organized fringe movement. It is 
something that’s been endorsed 
by the UF Office of Sustainabili-ty, GatorWell Health Promotion Services, the Humane Society of 
the United States and the Earth 
Day Network.             
And it’s time for UF and 
Gator Dining Services to realize 
a transition to Meatless Mondays 
could even save money. Student 
leaders will be meeting with din-
ing officials in the coming weeks to discuss the university’s grow-ing desire to support a Meatless 
Monday. In the meantime, I 
encourage everyone to join the 
Facebook group by searching for Meat-Free Monday at the University of Florida. Speak up 
for those who cannot speak for 
themselves and become part of 
the 10 percent.

As the votes from the Iowa Republican cau-cus began to roll in a week ago, most of the nation’s viewers were riveted by the small, 
fluctuating margin between Rick Santorum and the eventual winner, Mitt Romney. However, for con-servatives such as myself, the battle had been won before the clock struck midnight. 
Ron Paul, the hero of the chirping sect of liber -
tarianism, had been vanquished with only 21 per -
cent of the vote, a third-place finish that stifled his previous momentum. Years from now, may the av-erage Iowa voter who stood staunchly against the ideological torrent from the Ron Paul camp strip his sleeve, show his scars and say, “This vote I cast on caucus day.”
Now perhaps Ron Paul is not as monstrous as a 
Shakespearean villain. However, Paul is a follower of the poisonous ideology of libertarianism, a set of principles endorsing complete individual social and economic freedom. At first glance, this ideology seems compatible with conservatism, with its stance against centralized state power and corporate bail-outs. But the marriage between conservatism and libertarianism is not a natural one and will eventu-ally serve to rip the Republican Party asunder. 
In order to understand this, one must ask, “What 
is conservatism?” It might be more appropriate to say what it is not. Conservatism is not an ideology as libertarianism is. Conservatism is not a vehicle toward the vague enlightenment notion of prog-ress. In fact, the notion of progress is antithetical to conservatism, as conservatism is not a set of beliefs that serve as a drum roll toward a precise utopian ideal. Conservatism is a way of living, a disposition and attitude toward life. Conservatism is educated by traditional norms, not a set of 20th-century nov-els authored by a deranged Soviet expatriate. Con-servatives believe individual freedom without com-munal purpose is meaningless; libertarians believe individual freedom is a purpose itself. 
On paper, the average conservative and the av-erage libertarian want the same changes in Washing-ton: less government and more economic freedom. However, a Ron Paul nom-ination would set a dan-gerous precedent, because libertarians do not pretend to care about social norms 
— they say only that everyone has equal freedom, as though no freedoms were mutually exclusive. A libertarian victory would create a political environ-ment in which a nominee’s understanding of virtue and morality is irrelevant, much as it is in Europe. There is something unique about American voters. We care about what a candidate thinks about the moral tradition our ancestors set. It may be foolhar -
dy to believe political careerists could ever hold any true moral fiber, but we care all the same. 
Ron Paul’s defeat in Iowa was a victory for con-
servatives. However, the momentum is still in favor of his progressive ideology. In colleges and uni-versities around the country, including here at UF, Paul and his ilk have enormous support. I beseech you all to resist the honeyed words of libertarian dogma. 
Be wary of any doctrine that promises to bring 
radical change on the right or the left. Libertarian-ism has become its own secular religion, which will color your understanding of every issue, be it eco-nomic or social. When attempting to understand the world around you, look not to the radical fringes of politics but to the ancestors who came before us. 
They believed in small government not because 
it was virtuous in and of itself but because it al-lowed people to live virtuously. There is no virtue in libertarianism — only freedom for its own sake, and all the freedom in the world will not serve you if nothing exists to guide it.

letters@alligator.orgavailable upon request at polling locations and the 
SG office.
The supervisor of elections would also no longer 
be required to post a list of polling locations inside residence halls. The changes would require he or she post the poll locations through three unspecified forms of notification.
Students Party Sen. Carly Wilson, who is not a 
member of the committee, objected to the revision that would allow the Supervisor of Elections to add or change a polling location as long as it is “properly noticed.“
“It’s an improper delegation of power,” she said. To avoid a repeat of last semester’s address con-
fusion, committee co-chair Katie Waldman said she contacted Dean of Students Jen Day Shaw. The dean’s office was already working on a way to up-date students’ directory profiles, she said. 
Waldman said after the meeting that the office 
was updating students’ addresses for emergency purposes. The office discussed having students up-date their school contact information once a year, and the committee’s idea was similar, Waldman said. 
Waldman is waiting to hear back from the dean’s 
office for a final agreement. 
Senators will make their final votes on the election 
code revisions at Tuesday’s meeting. Any amend-ments to the bill must be submitted to the committee Friday and will be discussed at the committee meet-ing Sunday. 
Wilson said she plans to attend the meeting and 
wants to make sure that the amendments represent all UF’s students.
“I was not happy with how the codes ended up,” 
Wilson said.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 11, 2012

Alachua County commis-
sioners officially named Rick 
Drummond the new acting county manager Tuesday . 
Drummond is replacing for -
mer county manager Randall Reid, who had the job for 12 years. Reid is leaving to be the new county administrator of Sarasota County.
“[Drummond] was the best-
qualified candidate that could jump right in with no learn-ing curve,” said Mark Sexton, county spokesman.
The assistant county manag-
er since 2007, Drummond will be the acting manager until ei-ther a permanent replacement is found or until his contract ex-pires at the end of July 2013.
Drummond moved to 
Gainesville in August 2000 to become the county growth management director and was later appointed assistant county manager. He’ll receive a $160,000 annual salary, accord-ing to the terms of the agree-ment.
The county manager super -vises more than 800 employees working under the Board of County Commissioners, ac-cording to the county’s website. The job responsibilities include working with staff to develop recommendations on issues 
that come before the commis-
sion.
Drummond said he plans to 
retire in a year and a half.
“I feel like it’s the capping of 
my career,” he said.
One of the stipulations for 
candidates applying for the job 
was that they wouldn’t apply for the permanent position.
The County Commission 
will begin the search for a per -
manent manager after fall elec-tions.
Drummond said he is excit-
ed to take on the new position.              
“It’s a challenging time,” 
Drummond said, “but I’m re-ally looking forward to what this chance will bring.”Commissioners name

SENATE , from page 1Victim suffered multiple head injuries
Angelina Valuri. Martin drove away 
in the same 2011 Dodge Caliber they drove to Quandt’s house.
Quandt was left for dead, and 
police said after the assailants left he 
somehow used cooking oil to loos-
en the tape on his hands and then crawled to his motorized scooter to 
get help from a neighbor, who called 
911. He managed to give the neigh-bor a description of the suspects and say his safe was stolen, police said.
Soon after, he slipped into a coma. 
He was taken to Shands at UF, where he underwent surgery to relieve 
pressure on his brain. He suffered 
multiple head injuries and numerous broken bones in his face.
Shortly after the robbery, GPD Sgt. 
Steve Girard spotted Quandt’s white 
Cadillac, outfitted with a platform 
for a scooter, heading out of a nearby neighborhood. Girard chased. Jones led cops on a pursuit that at times ex-ceeded 100 mph, but ended shortly 
after midnight Tuesday when Jones 
rear-ended a blue Buick Century and clipped the right rear bumper of a black BMW 3 Series at Southwest 13th Street and Southwest Fifth Av-
enue.
Jones was 
treated by emer -
gency workers at 
the scene and was 
taken to Shands. 
He was trans-
ferred to Ala-
chua County Jail later in the day.  
Martin was identified as a suspect early Tuesday morning and turned 
herself in after being contacted by 
GPD. She admitted to planning the crime and helping Jones ransack the house, according to police. She said Jones beat Quandt.
According to GPD detective Ran-
dy Roberts, Martin last worked with Quandt “a couple months ago.”
Jones and Martin have both been 
charged with first-degree murder and home invasion robbery with a firearm, according to the Alachua County Jail website.
According to records from the 
Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Of-fice, Jones was charged with dealing 
in stolen property in October. He 
served about 70 days in jail.
Back in Blues Creek, Quandt’s 
neighbors talked Tuesday about how he frequently drove his scooter down 
the street with his Chihuahua, Lilly , 
sitting by his feet. But they said he hasn’t been outside much lately . They usually see him when the weather warms up.
Still, neighbors were surprised to 
find Quandt is 78.
“He doesn’t look that old,” said 
Lecreth Baker. “He was up to date. If there was a new gadget, he had it: iP -
hone, iPod, whatever. He certainly hadn’t lost it yet [mentally].”INVASION , from page 1
Haridopolos coordinates internships 
Sikes said Haridopolos has helped expand the stu-
dent internship program in Tallahassee, and students 
say they gained valuable experience from him.
“In this case, it depends on the value to the stu-
dents,” she said.
Justin Fisch, 21, took the Tallahassee internship 
during Spring 2010, when he was a sophomore. Twice a week, he and the 13 other interns gathered at 7:30 a.m. to meet with and receive guidance from Harido-polos before he went to work on the Senate floor. 
Now a senior pursuing a triple 
major in political science, geog-raphy and sustainability studies, Fisch said the senator’s instruction was a worthwhile component of the experience. 
“He was a wonderful coordina-
tor for the program right from the 
beginning,” Fisch said. “It was a 
very constructive experience for all 
of us.” SENATOr , from page 1

  Florida sophomore center Patric Young (4) blocks Georgia guard Gerald Robinson’s 
shot attempt in the second half of the Gators’ 70-48 win on Tuesday in the O’Dome. 
  MATT WATTS
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Georgia guard Gerald Robinson spun 
360 degrees in the lane, blowing by Erving 
Walker with his sights set on the rim. But Robinson didn’t see a trailing Patric Young, who swatted the layup attempt into the sixth 
row.
  Minutes later, Young closed out on a 
3-point look from UGA’s Dustin Ware, pro-
jecting his nearly 7-foot frame into Ware’s face and forcing the shot to bounce off iron.
  “(Robinson) was trying to make the high-
light reel for ESPN SportsCenter right there,” Young said. “But maybe I made the top 10 on making a block on him trying to get a little 
fancy.”
  The two standout plays from Young 
highlighted a renewed emphasis on defense 
headed up by coach Billy Donovan after a lackluster effort in a road loss to Tennessee on Saturday.
  Florida allowed Tennessee to shoot 51 
percent from the ﬂ  oor and 50 percent from beyond the arc in a disappointing 67-56 loss in Knoxville, Tenn., last weekend, and Dono-van challenged the Gators in practice during the weekend.
Florida (13-4, 1-1 Southeastern Confer-
ence) responded Tuesday night with a 70-48 victory against rival Georgia (9-7, 0-2 SEC) in the O’Connell Center.
  “I was much more pleased with our effort 
on that end of the ﬂ  oor, our level of aware-ness, being alert, sharp, focused,” Donovan said. “I thought we defended them very , very well. Obviously, we held them to 48 points. Any time you hold a team to 48 points, 
you’ve done a pretty good job defensively.”
  Donovan made a concerted effort to em-
phasize defensive intensity in practice lead-
ing up to the game, and what better opportu-nity for a turnaround then to have Georgia, with the lowest scoring average (62.9 ppg) and the second-worst ﬁ  eld goal percentage  Inspired defense helps Gators rout ‘Dawgs  W  elcome back to yet an-other glorious semester in Gainesville.

�   FORMER BOISE STATE 
COACH TO JOIN FLORIDA’S STAFF. 
GREG LUCA and MATT WATTS
 Alligator Staff Writers
   
 Brent Pease will be an-
nounced as Florida’s next of-
fensive coordinator today, ac-cording to a source close to the team. 
  Pease had been at Boise State 
for the last six years and served 
as the offensive coordinator and 
quarterbacks coach during the 2011 season. 
  According to a report earlier 
in the week by the Idaho States-man, Pease was weighing offers from Florida and Alabama.
  His arrival ﬁ  lls the void cre-ated by the departure of Charlie Weis, who left UF in December to become the head coach at Kansas. 
  Boise State’s offense ranked 
No. 9 nationally with 481.3 yards per game last season on the strength of quarterback Kel-len Moore, who threw for 3,800 yards, 43 touchdowns and 9 in-terceptions. 
  Florida ﬁ  nished No. 105 with 328.7 yards per game. 
  Pease has been a coach for 
15 years, spending 10 of those years as an offensive coordina-
tor. During that span, he called 
plays for Montana, Northern Arizona, Kentucky and Baylor before moving to Boise State in 2006. He was the Broncos’ wide receivers coach from 2006-10 and was assistant head coach under Chris Petersen from 2007-10.

Kenny Boynton knew Brad 
Beal’s shooting woes wouldn’t last 
long. 
After watching Beal, a freshman 
guard,  slip deeper into a four-game, 
14-of-47 shooting funk Saturday at 
Tennessee, Boynton said he didn’t know exactly when or where, but an offensive breakthrough would soon happen for his teammate.
As it turned out, Boynton need-
ed just one game for his prediction to pan out.
Along with 10 rebounds, Beal 
scored 17 points and went 4 of 8 from the field, including 4 for 6 on 3-pointers, to lead No. 13 Flor -
ida past Georgia 70-48 on Tuesday night.
“It was great; I’m happy for 
him,” said Boynton, a junior guard. “I said last game there was going to be a [time] when he came out 
and played good. And I think he 
needed a game like this, definitely in the SEC, this gives him a lot of confidence.”
Though coach Billy Donovan 
did not want to characterize Beal’s  play before Tuesday as a slump, he said the freshman starter was strug-gling recently with his comfort lev-
el within the Gators’ offense.
Beal turned the ball over 14 
times in his previous four games, 
including five against Tennessee. Donovan credited the rise in give-aways to Beal’s eagerness to defer 
to his teammates.
“I really felt like the last couple 
days in practice he was starting 
to figure some things out, offen-sively ,” Donovan said. “When he should be looking to shoot, when he should be looking to pass. And I think that’s been something that’s bogged him down a little bit, be-
cause he’s so unselfish.”
While reaching double figures 
for the first time in two games cer -
tainly helped Beal’s confidence, 
his  decision-making in his second SEC game was also drastically im-proved. 
Beal had just one turnover 
against the Bulldogs, despite doing 
most of his damage in the second half on aggressive drives to the bas-
ket. He went 5 of 6 from the free-throw line on three fouls once he got inside the paint. 
“Coach Donovan helped me 
realize, as well as Kenny and the 
rest of the players — they told me 
just relax,” Beal said. “They said it’s going to come. Kenny told me he went through the same thing his freshman year.”
In the first half, Beal kept Flor -
ida’s outside shooting afloat as he hit three straight 3-pointers in the final 5:40 of the first half to help 
stretch UF’s lead to 20 points. Four other Gators, including Boynton, 
who scored 17 points, would go a combined 3 of 15 from three.
Beal’s re-emergence from three 
comes after hitting only two treys in his last four outings. 
“Everybody has bad games and 
stuff like that, but I don’t really get too involved in getting down on myself,” Beal said. “My teammates always have faith in me and my coaches as well. And I really just try to focus and concentrate on the team concepts.”

Florida freshman guard Brad Beal scored 17 points on a 4-of-6 
shooting performance from three in Tuesday’s win against UGA.
UF holds UGA to season-low in points
(.409) in the SEC, come into Gainesville 
for a home game.
The Gators took full advantage, 
limiting the Bulldogs to a 20-for-55 shooting performance (36.4 percent) 
and setting a season low in points al-
lowed (48).
“We could have done even better 
than we did,” Young said. “We gave up too many 3-point shots. We had a lot of breakdowns. They offensive re-bounded on us a lot. I feel that even though we had a season low, we could have done even better than we did to-night.”
Young finished with eight points, 
10 boards and one of six UF blocks on the evening. The Gators also created five steals and turned the Bulldogs over 10 times.
Still, Georgia held a 14-6 advantage 
on the offensive glass and made 7 of the 18 threes it attempted, momentari-ly allowing the Bulldogs to pull within 13 points late in the second half.
But for the majority of the game, 
F l o r i d a pursued  aggres -
sively each 
loose ball and rebound, something it failed to do in the road loss to Tennes-see.
Against the V olunteers, Donovan 
said the Gators gave up too many easy shots and didn’t maintain focus on de-fense. That wasn’t a problem Tuesday, as Florida contested nearly every shot 
Georgia put up until the game was out 
of reach.“We played a lot harder,” guard 
Brad Beal said of how UF was able to architect the quick turnaround on de-fense. “UAB and Tennessee, we gave 
up too many points in transition. We 
were too lackadaisical on defense, and tonight I feel we did a pretty good job.”
On the other end of the floor, Beal 
broke out of a miniature freshman slump, tying Kenny Boynton for the game-high in points with 17. Beal, the Gators’ leader in minutes and re-
bounds and the team’s second-leading 
scorer, had not broken double digits in Florida’s last two games.
“He had a much, much better feel 
and flow today offensively than he’s had in a few games,” Donovan said.

THE RALLY
Greg: Alabama’s 21-0 win against LSU 
in the BCS title game may not have 
been the most entertaining to watch, 
but it reaffirmed one thing many of us already knew: The SEC is king. 
As one self-gratifying, not-totally-in-your-
face-but-still-pretty-clear commercial not-so-
subtly explained, the Southeastern Confer -
ence claimed its sixth straight national title 
Monday.
Fans of the SEC — a.k.a supporters of the 
school’s cellar dwellers who need excuses for 
why their teams are consistently thrashed — 
need to enjoy it while they can, because there’s 
no way this streak lasts. 
First off, it’s difficult to believe these 12 
(now 14) schools have some super system that allows them to consistently win the crapshoot 
that is recruiting.
And even if the SEC could somehow as-
semble the NCAA’s most dominant rosters 
every year, it’s nearly impossible to predict 
which teams will successfully navigate a 12-
game minefield where one loss could mean an 
end to title contention. 
Tom: You couldn’t be more wrong here. 
The SEC’s reign of terror isn’t coming to an 
end — it’s just hitting it’s stride.
The SEC had every right to troll the rest 
of America with that awesome, in-your-face, 
we’re-better-than-you commercial Monday 
night, because an SEC team is very likely to 
win it all again next season.
To paraphrase our good friend from the Bayou, Mr. Aureli-
ous Faux Pas III, the 
SEC has the best, 
and fastest, athletes 
in the land. With the 
conference touting 
six consecutive BCS 
champions, where do you think a lot of 
the nation’s top high school players are going 
to want to go play college ball? That’s right, 
the SEC.
They say power in college football is cycli-
cal, and I agree — from team to team. But the 
SEC is playing chess out there while the rest 
of these conferences are playing checkers, and 
as long as that’s the case, the SEC will reign supreme in college football.
Greg: The problem there is you’re assum-
ing recruits make decisions rationally. The amount of flip-flopping that goes on in the re-
cruiting process is absurd, and kids committed 
to Florida can just as easily end up at Utah, as 
Visesio Salt proved this week. Plus, it’s pretty 
clear that recruiting stars don’t guarantee any-thing on Saturdays. 
Even if they did, recruits are attracted to 
coaches, not programs. The fact that only three 
current SEC coaches (Les Miles at LSU, Steve 
Spurrier at South Carolina, and Mark Richt 
at Georgia) have had their current job for the 
duration of the six-year streak shows just how 
volatile the coaching world is, making great-
ness extremely difficult to sustain. The Southeast 
may have the most 
high school talent, 
but there’s no reason 
to believe those ath-
letes will stay there. 
With Twitter and 
Facebook and the Internet and TV and 
texting and bribes
, every coach has a national 
reach. Nothing prevents Florida’s best athletes 
from going to play for Urban Meyer at Ohio 
State, even though he won two of the “SEC’s” 
six championships. 
Tom: Sure, but this whole debate begins 
and ends with one question: Will the SEC’s 
streak come to a close soon? The answer is no.
Of those three coaches who have been 
around since the start of the streak, Miles has 
won a title and had LSU a game away from another one, Richt has brought in top talent (a 
No. 5 class last year and another highly touted 
class set for next month) that will make Geor -
gia a contender next season, and Spurrier has turned South Carolina around since taking 
over. 
Oh, and the SEC still has the best coach 
in the world: Nick Saban — and there’s no 
chance he leaves Alabama any time soon, at least not before he takes home a couple more 
crystal footballs.
And as long as those coaches are around, 
that talent will keep flocking to those schools, 
and those coaches will flip that talent into ti-tles.
Like the Heat’s LeBron James said when 
he was celebrating signing with Miami in July 2010, “Not six, not seven, not eight...”
Greg: How’d that work out for LeBron? 
Yeah, that’s what I thought. 
Your point is right on, Nick Saban and Les 
Miles will always be in the national title con-versation. I’m not saying the SEC is going to 
fall off entirely , because that’s just not true. 
But there’s just no way the SEC coaches are 
head and shoulders above Meyer, Bob Stoops, 
Lane Kiffin, Chris Peterson, Chip Kelly, Frank Beamer and all the other great coaches playing 
the same game they are. 
All you can really guarantee is that Ala-
bama and LSU will continue to contend. Not 
dominate. 
Tom: Alabama and LSU will continue to 
contend. So will Georgia. And Arkansas. And 
even Florida again in a few seasons.
The Kiffins and Petersons and Stoopses of 
the world are all great coaches, too. But even 
at 4-foot-9, Saban is still head and shoulders 
above them. 
Besides, we’ve seen what happens when 
other conferences try the SEC in the BCS title 
game, as evidenced by the SEC’s 5-0 record in those games. The conference proved Monday 
that only one thing can stand in the way of an 
SEC team winning it all these days: the SEC.

Gators junior forward Jennifer George has recorded eight straight 
double-doubles, which is five shy of tying the school record.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Junior forward Jennifer George 
does not worry about double-dou-
bles.
Her streak of eight consecutive 
games with double-digit points and rebounds does not cross her mind.
Neither does the school record 
of 13 straight double-doubles, a mark set by former All-American and current UF assistant coach Murriel Page.
“I just try to be consistent,” 
George said. “Coach Page and I don’t talk about it that much. We just try to get better every day at practice.”
Even though they do not discuss 
the streak, Page is well aware of the steps George has taken to reach her current level of play.
The 2010-11 campaign was dis-
appointing not only for Florida, but also for George.
She averaged 6.8 points and 
5.6 rebounds per game in a trying 
season that ended with the Gators 
failing to reach the NCAA Tourna-ment.
“She knew she could do better,” 
Page said. “She just took it upon 
herself this summer to go and get 
in the gym and work hard every day.”
George’s diligence has paid off 
so far this season as she leads the Gators with 14 points and 10.1 re-bounds per game.Page credits George’s improve-
ment to her “relentless” work ethic and improved communication with 
her teammates.
“One thing she didn’t do last 
year was demand the ball,” Page 
said. “This year, if the girls miss her, she’ll go up to them and say, ‘I 
was open. Get me the ball.’”
George’s statistical outburst has 
been a long time coming accord-
ing to redshirt senior guard Jordan Jones.
Jones labeled George as a “dou-
ble-double player” during the pre-
season, and she said the team has 
expected George to play like this all along.
“She’s a beast, she’s the strongest 
player on the team, she’s able to 
dominate like this, and it’s always 
been inside of her,” Jones said. “It gives us confidence to put shots up there and know that George — 
more times than not — if we miss, 
she’s going to get the rebound and put it in.”
Although George’s double-
double streak has continued into 
Southeastern Conference play, her 
skills have been somewhat under -utilized. In the last five minutes of last Sunday’s loss to South Caro-
lina, George only attempted one 
shot — a layup off an offensive re-bound.
“It’s on us and it’s on her,” Jones 
said. “We need her to demand the 
ball more and we need to be more 
aware that she’s not getting touches and she’s dominating.”
According to Page, George un-
derstands that she needs to con-tinue calling for the ball in order to establish an offensive presence in the paint.
However, George prioritizes her 
role on the team and what she can do to help Florida win games and contend for the SEC Champion-ship.
“She’s not thinking about what 
she’s doing for herself,” Page said. “She’s just trying to improve every day and get out there and get re-bounds and score for her team.”
Page said that during her play-
ing days at Florida, she aimed to leave her mark by adding her name to the record books.
However, she acknowledges 
that she enjoys watching players like George compete and even best the numbers she put up during her time in Gainesville.
“To hold a double-double (re-
cord), that’s something that not too many players do,” Page said. 
“That’s (George’s) way of leav-
ing her legacy and also challenging post players that come here after 
her.”

 Coach Rhonda Faehn may have 
found herself another dynamic 
freshman. 
  Kytra Hunter made a huge state-
ment as an all-around competitor in No. 3 Florida’s 196.025-194.675 road win against North Carolina 
State on Friday. 
In her collegiate debut, Hunter 
ﬁ  nished with 39.3 points to win the 
all-around title, scoring a 9.85 on vault, a 9.775 on uneven parallel 
bars, a 9.775 on balance beam and a 
meet-high 9.9 on the ﬂ  oor exercise.
  Hunter is the fourth Gator in 25 
years to claim an all-around title in 
a season opener.
  “We know she’s extremely tal-
ented and a phenomenal athlete,” 
Faehn said. 
“That was fun to be able to see 
her get out there and do a great job right from the start.” 
  Hunter, who hails from Fred-
erick, Md., was a member of the 
2009-10 and 2010-11 U.S. Senior 
National Teams and has competed in the 2009 European Tour and the Visa Championships, among other events.   Hunter said competing with 
the U.S. National Team helped her learn to calm her nerves  in front of large audiences.
  So when Hunter debuted her 
ﬂ  oor routine in front of a crowd of 2,512 at the Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh, N.C., last Friday, every-
thing went smoothly.
  “It felt great,” she said. “I mean, 
as a freshman, I got to get my feet wet.”
Hunter’s all-around efforts add 
to a formidable core that includes 
junior All-Americans Ashanée Dickerson and Marissa King.
  For the Gators, Hunter’s break-
out debut has to feel like deja vu. In last year’s opener against Nebras-ka, then-freshman Alaina Johnson 
scored a 39.425 as an all-around 
competitor. Like Hunter, Johnson recorded a 9.9 on ﬂ  oor. 
  Johnson, the 2011 Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year, followed up her debut with even stronger scores in her second meet: a 9.95 in vault, a 9.925 in bars and a 
9.85 in ﬂ  oor. 
  Hunter said she hopes she can 
continue the trend when Florida 
hosts Illinois-Chicago on Friday 
night at 7 in the Gators’ home 
opener. She added that during this week’s practices she has been working on her landings, as well as handstands on bars.
  “I’m really conﬁ  dent,” Hunter 
said. “I did make mistakes (against North Carolina State), and going out as a freshman my ﬁ  rst meet, I 
wasn’t going to be perfect. But I’d 
rather have mistakes that I can go in and ﬁ  x than be perfect and have nothing to ﬁ  x.”
  While Hunter remains self-
assured, her coach might be even more conﬁ  dent in the freshman’s abilities.
  “She has that star quality,” 
Faehn said. 
“I say that she’s all business be-
cause she gets through everything so quickly. But just her sheer pow-er, her vault and her tumbling, is 
just phenomenal. I would say the 
best in the country.”  Freshman Hunter makes early impact
“We know she’s extremely 
talented and a phenomenal 
athlete.That was fun to be 
able to see her get out there 
and do a great job right from 
the start.”
