Students trash holiday gifts for eco-friendly crafting event

Gainesville Twinkie supply runs low
The Butler Plaza Publix Super Market sold its last Twinkies, pg 8. Dear Readers,
For nearly three years, the Alligator has been work-
ing with UF toward a compromise on its signature or-
ange news racks. As of Friday, the Alligator’s Board of Directors 
made a signiﬁ  cant step toward resolving the dispute.
In December 2009, UF’s Board of Trustees passed a rule pro-
hibiting distribution of all publications on campus unless ap-
proved by UF’s vice president for business affairs. The Alligator was not consulted about the change, and although the proposal was published, UF made no effort to reach out to the newspa-per.
At about the same time, a plan was drafted to remove all pri-
vately owned distribution racks from campus and replace them with university-owned modular racks.
Since then, the Alligator has fought to keep its orange racks, 
and by extension, its ability to reach the Student Body.
On Aug. 8, facing an Aug. 15 deadline to remove 24 of its 
racks from campus, the Alligator ﬁ  led a lawsuit asking the fed-eral court in Gainesville to allow the racks to remain and to block UF’s regulation on the distribution of publications on First Amendment grounds.
On Friday, the Alligator’s Board of Directors voted to recom-
mend a settlement to UF the board believes will be an accept-able compromise for both the university and the newspaper.
Under the terms of the settlement, the Alligator would re-
move 24 of its news racks in areas of UF’s campus where UF has placed its modular black racks. All other orange Alligator racks would be licensed and allowed to remain on campus.

HURRICANE SANDY
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Writer
Michelle Albert visited New 
York City for the ﬁ  rst time last 
weekend. Like most tourists, she got lost on the subway and ate gi-ant sandwiches, but she wasn’t just 
there to sightsee: She spent most of 
her time aiding Hurricane Sandy victims.
The 19-year-old public relations UF sophomore rode 17 hours on a 
bus with 39 other students and two 
staff members on a relief trip spon-sored by UF Hillel in partnership with the Columbia/Barnard Hillel in New York. 
The group worked in Rockaway 
Beach in Queens.
The bus left Thursday after-
noon and arrived in New York on 
Friday, said UF Hillel staff mem-
ber Melissa Stern.The area was “eerie,” she said. 
Houses were vacant, health ofﬁ  -cials were driving around to give people air ﬁ  lter masks and ﬁ  re trucks were in the middle of the streets, Stern said. 
Inside the houses, there were 
watermarks higher than Stern’s head. She is 5 feet 3 inches tall.
The group mostly tore down 
parts of houses, like drywall and decks, that were too water-dam-aged to stay standing, she said. 
In the two days the UF Hillel 
group was there, a lot was accom-plished.
“A lot of families said that we 
got so much done in one day that all of that would have taken them more than two weeks,” she said.
Stern spoke of a few fami-
lies who had sons who were all 
friends. 
The guys told all of the students that in a few months, when every-
thing’s better, they’d take them around Rockaway Beach and let them stay at their houses.
“They were offering anything 
they could to show their grati-tude,” she said.
Stern said she never thought 
that she’d have the opportunity to staff a trip like this. UF Hillel re-

An article in Thursday’s edition of the Alligator in-correctly attributed a para-phrased quote to Danielle Cotillo. Cotillo’s friend, 
Kaitlyn Kramer, said she was 
warned of West Nile Virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses when she studied abroad. Cotillo did not say that friends told her that they were warned of the disease while studying abroad.Cotillo also wanted to make 
it clear that she was surprised 
that the disease was found in Alachua County, not the United States.An article in Monday’s edi-tion of the Alligator incor -
rectly stated that Palestinian rockets have killed at least 18 people since Wednesday. In fact, three people have been killed so far in Israel, and 107 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli airstrikes be-gan. 12th Annual Latin American

Employees of UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability make Christmas bows out of magazines on Monday 
at the Reitz Union. The Christmas decorations were created out of sustainable materials.

UF students may ﬁ  nd their best dec-
orations in the trash can this holiday 
season.
UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability showed 
ﬁ  ve students how to turn used materi-als into holiday treasures while they sipped hot cocoa and ate cookies at the 
GIY: Green It Yourself Holiday Edition-
UpCycle Christmas Crafts event Mon-day afternoon.
Students of all artistic skill levels 
made bows, wreaths, ornaments and 
gift bags out of old magazines and toi-
let paper rolls.
The ofﬁ  ce provided the materials 
along with glitter, ribbon, glue, rubber 
bands and a stapler at four craft-mak-
ing stations in the Reitz Union to give students ideas for festive, inexpensive and environmentally friendly crafts.
“We ﬁ  gured with the holidays com-
ing up, it would be a good way for peo-ple to save money by making their own Christmas decor and also help things from going into the trash,” said Nicole Galehouse, 25, sustainability and the 
built environment senior and intern 
with the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability.
The third in the Green It Yourself 
series, the workshop was the Ofﬁ  ce of 
Sustainability’s ﬁ  rst holiday event. 
In the two previous workshops, stu-
dents made green cleaning products 
and recycled paper planters.
The most popular craft was a gift 
bow made of long strips of magazine.
“I deﬁ  nitely have to go home and 
teach my mom this,” said Samantha Doucette, a 22-year-old journalism se-
nior.Students trash holiday gifts for eco-friendly crafting event
“We ﬁ  gured with the holidays 
coming up, it would be a good 
way for people to save money 
by making their own Christmas 
decor and also help things from 
going into the trash.”
 Nicole Galehouse
Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability internceived such a positive response from students that 
it hopes to sponsor other volunteer visits in the fu-
ture, she said.
For Albert, putting faces to the Hurricane Sandy 
damage had the most impact.
“They’re just resilient, and having that image in 
the back of my mind makes me grateful for all I 
have,” she said.
It also changed how Albert thinks about charity 
work.
“They don’t need our pity,” she said. “They 
need us to come alongside them and help them.”
On the second day, Albert said she and some 
friends were tearing out insulation with a man named Vincent and his wife. 
At the end of the day, to show gratitude for their 
help, Vincent went out and bought them the “best eggplant and chicken Parmesan sandwiches on the 
island,” she said.
“And we just sat on his porch for an hour and 
a half and ate and talked to him,” Albert said. “He 
felt so blessed and honored that these people from South Florida would come help him.”
Columbia/Barnard Hillel Executive Director 
Brian Cohen felt similarly.
“This is an unbelievable thing that the students 
did,” Cohen wrote in an email. 
“To come up here and spend so much time on 
the bus — to volunteer for two days — they really did help those in need.”

WERE GROUNDED ON FRIDAY. 
RACHEL CROSBY
Alligator Contributing Writer
The University Athletic Associa-
tion addressed Monday the market-
ing department’s decision to ban 
UF cheerleaders from tumbling and 
performing stunts at practices, events 
and games.
“We understand that the modern 
day culture of cheerleading encour -
ages acrobatic stunts, which require tremendous athletic skill,” said Steve 
McClain, UAA senior associate athlet-ics director, in an emailed statement 
to the Alligator. “The reality, howev-er, is that the danger associated with 
these types of stunts is simply not worth the risk to the cheerleaders or 
to the University of Florida.”
Jason Merslich, a 27-year-old for -
mer Gators cheerleader, former team coach and still-involved volunteer, 
said the cheerleaders’ frequent prac-
ticing makes it less risky.
According to the GatorZone cheer -
leading website, the teams practice two to three times a week to work on 
tumbling skills, stunting, pyramids 
and basket tosses.
“I’d like to see someone who’s not 
an athlete throw someone in the air 
above their head or be held in the air 
and stay steady on one leg,” Merslich 
said.
McClain reminded people in the 
email that cheerleading is not one of 
UF’s varsity competitive sports. In-
stead, he said, it is a “support group” 
intended to generate spirit at UF events.
The decision to effectively ground 
the UF cheerleaders “was not one 
that was made lightly ,” McClain said 
in the email.“Instead of waiting for a tragedy 
to occur,” McClain said in the email, “we are taking a proactive stance to 
protect the cheerleaders.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2012

An unidentified patron of Mars Pub and 
Arcade snuck out of the venue Friday night 
with a pair of unusual — and illegal — souve-nirs: two stolen paintings.
Mars co-owner Allison Basker said the staff 
noticed the paintings were gone at about mid-night. She said the paintings were priced at $25 each.
One of the paintings stolen off the walls be-
longed to 22-year-old artist Jessica Cook. 
“My initial reaction was, of course, anger but also confusion,” Cook said. “Who steals independent art?”
Basker said the artwork was taken some-
time during Friday’s five-band show that last-ed until after midnight.
Earlier in the evening, she said, someone 
tried to take a painting, but staff and patrons 
thwarted the would-be thief.
Although an attendant was present in the 
gallery , she said, a bartender reported that 
someone tried to walk out with a painting, and a bystander stopped him.
Sometime later, the two pieces went miss-
ing.“It’s a small town — a small scene,” she 
said. “We thought we’d figure it out pretty 
quickly.”
The missing paintings hung with about 
eight other canvases on the black walls of the 
foyer. The room has doubled as an art gallery and conduit between the bar and arcade since Mars reopened last month.
Basker said she’s ruled out the possibility 
of the thief walking out the front door. She said whoever snuck out with the hot items must 
have used a back door — possibly the door to 
the right of the stage where bands were load-ing and unloading gear — and must have been familiar with the building.
“We’re pretty sure the person who did it 
hangs out here a lot,” she said.
Local artist Kat Van Riet’s painting, titled 
“Videre V erum,” was also taken. 
Riet posted a notice about the stolen paint-
ing on Reddit, asking for help in tracking it down.
Cook said she learned her painting had 
been stolen when she read an alert post Sun-
day morning about the theft on Mars’ Face-book page.

Police confronted a sus-
pect at gunpoint after a call 
that he was pointing a sil-
ver pellet gun at cars.
Michael Petersen, 62, 
was arrested on charges of 
attempted aggravated bat-
tery and evidencing preju-
dice while committing an offense Sunday afternoon.
At 2:14 p.m., Petersen 
pointed his pellet gun 
at James Breedon, of 
Gainesville, as he drove west on Southwest 16th Av-enue, according to a GPD 
arrest report.
Gainesville Police went 
to the bus stop at 716 SW 
16th Ave. and found Peter -
son with what looked like a 
handgun.
The three officers or -
dered Petersen repeatedly 
to drop what they thought 
was his handgun. Once 
they detained him, they re-alized the gun was a pellet gun.
Petersen said he had 
been pointing the pellet gun at cars “because he thought 
it was funny,” according to 
an email from GPD spokes-man Ben Tobias.
Peters -
en said he had the pellet gun b e c a u s e he was go-
ing to go to the Bo D i d d l e y Commu -
nity Plaza and point it “at the black people so they don’t f--k with me,” accord-ing to the report.
He said he was con-
vinced the “black people” on the plaza would respect him after he scared them.
Petersen is being held on 
a $10,000 bond.

hiLLeL , from page 1Residents appreciated all of the helpThe meeting is on Dec. 7
The settlement will be pre-
sented to UF’s Board of Trustees 
for consideration at its Dec. 7 meeting. If accepted, the settle-ment would go into effect imme-diately, and the Alligator would file a voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit by Dec. 10.
The Alligator’s attorney, Tom 
Julin, has also proposed revisions to UF’s rule on distribution of publications to ensure that UF will not use the modular racks to censor the Alligator or prevent access to the paper.
We, the editors of the Alliga-
tor, feel the settlement is a fair and just compromise. After three years of struggling with this is-sue, we are hopeful that UF will accept the settlement and that the dispute will come to a close.
Our focus has always been on 
bringing independent and unbi-ased news to the Student Body. We hope that with this settle-
ment, we’ll always be free to do 
just that.

Eleven different competitions, hun-
dreds of gaming consoles and more than 
10,000 feet of cord filled the Reitz Union 
Grand Ballroom on Monday evening for 
the second GatorLAN 2012 video game tournament.
The eight-hour event was hosted by the 
Gator Gaming club. 
Registration was open to the public.Gator Gaming President Ed Fonseca 
said that between competitors and spec-tators, about 1,000 people usually attend 
GatorLAN.
“When you watch NBA, you want to 
see your favorite team win,” the digital 
arts and sciences junior said. “There are a 
bunch of girls who don’t play but come to 
see their boyfriends play.”
Crystal Durham, a 21-year-old com-
puter engineering UF senior, came to the event to watch her boyfriend and his two 
roommates compete in the Super Smash 
Bros. Brawl tournament.
“I wouldn’t enjoy watching a video game match if I didn’t know the people playing,” she said.
For Tommy Janky, recognizing compet-
itors wasn’t a problem. 
The 22-year-old Santa Fe nursing soph-
omore said he knew about 70 percent of the more than 100 people registered for the 
Super Smash Bros. Brawl tournament.
Janky said his main competition for Ga-
torLAN 2012 was a gamer who goes by the 
tag True Blue.
“He’s my partner in tournaments,” 
Janky said. 
“He knows everything I do.”Janky said he has traveled as far as New 
Jersey to compete in Super Smash Bros. 
Brawl tournaments. 
He once won $350 at a tournament in 
Orlando, which he used to fund trips.
He said similar behavior between com-
petitors in the gaming community has caused more people to consider gaming as 
an actual sport.
“People travel all over the world like 
sports teams do,” he said. “There’s money 
on the line. Some people are actually spon-
sored.”Janky said the Super Smash Bros. Brawl 
community was strong enough that in-ternational rankings for characters in the 
game have emerged online.“I’m the best Ike in the U.S.,” he said. 
“That’s a fact.”

This holiday season, donat-
ing toys to sick children is being 
made easy by a Gainesville com-pany — all you have to do is like them.
Locally owned business New 
Scooters 4 Less is making an im-pression in Gainesville through their online campaign Likes 4 Tikes.
Collin Austin, owner of New 
Scooters 4 Less and the com-pany’s “chief of everything,” en-thusiastically shared the history 
behind the campaign and the 
prospects for this year.  
“My sister is a nurse at Shands, 
and she told me that she sees kids spending Christmas in a hospital bed every year,” Austin said. “It made me think, since we want to 
give back, that maybe those kids 
should be our focus.”
The initial pledge of the on-
line campaign was that for every “like” the New Scooters 4 Less Facebook page received, the busi-ness would donate $1 to buying toys for sick children at Shands. Quickly after the campaign start-
ed, it gained unexpected steam 
and developed a new pledge. For every “like” the Facebook page receives, New Scooters 4 Less will donate one new toy to Shands.
Celebrations Catering, who is sponsoring the campaign with Scooters 4 Less, offers a Thanks-
giving feast meal package that 
allows customers to purchase a premade Thanksgiving meal with all of the trimmings for $150. For every $150 the compa-ny receives, it is donating $15 to the Likes 4 Tikes cause.
Along with Celebrations Ca-
tering, the youthful photo decor company Fracture has thrown its hat in the ring. Fracture plans to mirror the New Scooters 4 Less social media campaign by donat-ing one toy to Shands for every 
new “like” on their Facebook 
page.
All the toys donated to the 
hospital would be placed at the doors of the children’s rooms un-wrapped.
For Austin, that wasn’t good 
enough. He will wrap and deco-rate the gifts for the children at 
Shands on Dec. 20.  
“We told Shands that we 
hope to generate enough toys to 
where they have to give them to another organization,” Austin said. “Plus, the best part of get-ting a toy is unwrapping it — we want them to have that.”Local company

A cook at the Pollo Tropical in the Reitz Union 
was arrested on a battery charge Sunday morning.
Gainesville Police arrested Jevon Terrell Battles, 
20, on a charge of simple battery.
A witness, Antron Hutchinson, and the victim, 
Ashley Kerney, told Gainesville Police that Battles 
was arguing with Kerney when he got angry and 
grabbed her hair and slammed her against a wall.
Battles then pulled her to the ground and 
punched her in the face repeatedly.
After Battles’ attack, there was blood throughout 
his apartment, Kerney’s nose was bleeding, the right side of her face was bruised and swollen, and her lip was cut, according to a GPD arrest report.
According to the report, when police questioned 
Battles, he said Kerney tried to hit him, so he grabbed 
her and pulled her to the ground.
Battles told police that as he 
and Kerney fell, she hit her face on 
the corner of a dresser.
Later in the police interview, 
Battles stopped and said, “Let me 
tell you the truth,” according to the report.
Battles then told police he had 
hit her in the face multiple times.
He was arrested at 2:10 a.m.Contact Benjamin S. Brasch at bbrasch@alligator.

� THE GROUP WANTS A 
PENNY MORE PER POUND OF TOMATOES.
SHELBY WEBB
Alligator Staff Writer
Many will be celebrating the 
Thanksgiving holiday with food, 
but some Gainesville activists are concerned about the hands that gather that feast.
Members of the Gainesville In-
terfaith Alliance for Immigrant Jus-tice, along with some students and local religious leaders, protested outside of a Gainesville Publix on Monday to push for better wages for some Florida farmworkers.
The alliance organized the event 
as part of the Coalition of Immoka-lee Workers Thanksgiving Week of Action, which aims to persuade Publix Super Markets executives 
to agree to pay more for tomatoes 
from Immokalee.
“Their inability to sign a very 
simple agreement is perpetuating human slavery,” said Larry Green, pastor at Westminster Presbyterian Church.
Protesters waved signs and 
chanted outside of the Publix locat-
ed on the corner of 34th Street and 
University Avenue.
Victor Yengle, a 23-year-old UF 
economics senior, said the group wants Publix to pay a penny more per pound of tomatoes picked by Immokalee farmworkers.
“This is a 32-pound bucket,” he 
said, holding a large red container. 
“Right now, they get 45 cents for 
every bucket they fill. That rate has been stagnant for the past 30 years, and it hasn’t even been adjusted for inflation.”
Through an information packet, Publix said if the wholesaler raised its prices to improve working con-ditions in Immokalee, the super -
market would agree to pay more.
“Publix is more than willing to 
pay a penny more per pound — or whatever the market price for to-
matoes will be — in order to pro-
vide product to our customers,” a statement released by Publix said. “However, we will not pay em-ployees of other companies directly for their labor.”
Yengle said though Publix re-
mains the biggest priority in terms of businesses signing the Fair Food 
Program, farmworkers in Immoka-
lee are encouraged that other com-panies signed the agreement.
“When you talk to the farm-
workers, you can tell the program is working,” Yengle said. “They see a new day on the horizon.”

How Hostess will most 
likely go out of business
Late last week, we learned that Hostess Brands planned to 
ﬁ  le for bankruptcy , due to a ﬁ  ght between the company and one of its largest unions.
People mourned, people hoarded, people tried to sell 
Twinkies — one of the company’s most beloved treats — for 
thousands of dollars on eBay.
On Monday afternoon, “Hostess Brands Inc. and its striking 
union agreed to a mediation that will forestall the company’s 
planned liquidation for the time being,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
“Both sides agreed to try to work through their conﬂ  ict, 
which would preserve more than 18,000 jobs that will otherwise disappear if the Irving, Texas-based company closes its doors,” said the paper.
Great! So many jobs will be saved. That’s really good news.Not great! That much junk food will still be on our shelves.    
      Now, there is a time and a place for Doritos or Honey Buns or Funyuns or other more generic packaged foods. We’re not say-ing all junk or snack food companies should just shut their doors and stop production entirely.
Please, don’t. But maybe it’s time to take a hard look at our-
selves if we pay such a huge amount of our attention to the “death” of the Twinkie. Hostess also makes Wonder Bread, 
which you might remember if you were a latchkey kid of the 
‘50s.
“Since the 1950s and ’60s, toast has been a staple of most 
breakfasts, while bread has been on the dinner table in almost every household,” said Time magazine. “Gradually , though, our diets have changed and our consumer preferences have shift-ed.”
We have more options for breakfast than just stupid, plain 
toast. Plus, everyone either thinks they’re allergic to gluten or 
they actually are, so fewer people are buying bread products in 
general.
Fun fact: Time said that tortilla purchases increased by 3.6 
percent each year since 2007. Plus, less people are serving a bread item as a side with dinner — a meal Americans are spend-ing less time eating, as well.
“Dinner is changing,” said Harry Balzer, chief industry ana-
lyst with the food-industry-analysis ﬁ  rm NPD Group. “We spend 24 minutes eating dinner. It’s become less and less and less. So 
we’re always looking at where we can save time or money.”
So maybe we’re not making better food choices, but we’re 
making meal choices that include less actual bread. Either way , 
Americans are moving on from the 1950s and into more totally tubular food choices. Ever hear of the soup-to-go that you cook in a bag? Yeah, that’s Campbell’s way of making soup appeal more to the “millennials.”
That soup is marketed to young people who don’t have a lot 
of time to cook actual food. Seems like we’re not eating bread 
anymore. Maybe we should extend that hurried version of din-
ner to our snacks.
There’s no need to mourn the loss of the Twinkie. It’s better 
for you and your health if it slowly disappears off shelves.UF community deserves full-week break
For the ﬁ  rst time, UF will begin its observance of the 
Thanksgiving holiday on a Wednesday. In years past, Wednesday was regarded as a normal day for 
school and work.
Interestingly, Associate Provost Bernard Mair has dis-
couraged faculty in regard to the cancellation of classes scheduled on Monday and Tuesday this week.
Most students are thrilled just to have the Wednesday 
without classes. However, UF ofﬁ  cials are concerned the Thanksgiving holiday will be extended even further in the future.
What would be the problem with that?
I wish the people responsible for these decisions would 
be more inclined to give students and faculty as long of a 
break as possible. I strongly disagree with the idea of man-dating that classes occur this week, and I believe students, faculty and staff should be able to enjoy all ﬁ  ve days off.
Time off is a necessity to one’s sanity. I don’t believe 
many administrators realize how hectic the schedules 
of students and faculty members can get. We all balance 
school, jobs, extracurricular activities and a social life while we’re here. We want to be able to take time every now and then to be with our family and friends who we don’t get to see as often during the academic semesters.
You would think administration would be more ac-
cepting of students missing classes now, when the semes-ter is winding down, rather than during the middle of the term. Closing the university for an extra two days during Thanksgiving Break would be far more beneﬁ  cial than 
keeping it open when no one is present.
UF administration should know all students don’t 
waste these days off.
We catch up on assignments, rest and recover our 
brains and bodies from late nights of studying, and even 
do things that could contribute to our professional futures. I know many students who spent the long weekend during Homecoming traveling for interviews and speaking with 
organizations about opportunities that could contribute to their professional futures.  
Professors would see beneﬁ  ts 
as well. They, too, have travel 
plans and could even use the ex-
tra time to prepare for the end of 
the semester, if they chose to.
If Monday and Tuesday class-
es were canceled, students would have a much easier time making 
travel arrangements to their respective homes. A weekend departure is a lot less difﬁ  cult to set up in comparison to a long commute starting in the middle of a weekday.
There are plenty of theoretical solutions that might 
solve this problem. Perhaps if this Fall we started the se-mester on Monday rather than Wednesday, we could use those two extra days as vacation time for right now and have a full week of Thanksgiving Break.
The school will be open this week, but it will also be 
nearly empty. UF administration really should take heed 
to the trends made evident by the actions of its students. 
The university calendar should reﬂ  ect their interests and priorities as well.
Why pay to keep the university open this week when a 
majority of students, and even some faculty, have already left town?
If I were a professor at UF, I especially would not want 
to spend two days mandatorily giving lectures to empty classrooms or sitting in ofﬁ  ce hours waiting for students who won’t show up.
Many professors who are still having class this week 
both understand and expect attendance won’t be very high. They’ve sent students home for a break and only expect their full attention upon their returns when ﬁ  nal exam season begins.
Why can’t UF administration manage to do the same?Anayo Ordu is an advertising sophomore at UF. Her col-

Letter to the Editor
I am writing in response to Leila Milgrim’s 
insightful article “Gainesville’s Hidden Trea-
sures: Vegan-Friendly Restaurants” (Nov. 18).  
I am not surprised to hear about these delicious 
vegan dishes in UF’s backyard. It is especially important for restaurants near campuses to of-fer a variety of vegan options on their menus. 
According to a study by food-service provider 
Bon Appétit, the number of college students who identify themselves as vegetarian has ris-en by 50 percent since 2005, and the number of vegan students has more than doubled during 
the same period.
Students are horrified to learn that cows 
have their throats slit while they’re still con-
scious and that many chickens are scalded to 
death in hot water. It’s simply not the kind 
of industry that students want to support. In addition to enduring cruelty , farmed animals produce about 130 times as much waste as the entire human population of the United States does. According to the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, the runoff from factory farms pol-
lutes our rivers and lakes more than all other industrial sources combined.
From the smallest community colleges to 
the largest state schools, vegan options are ev-erywhere nowadays as a direct result of stu-dent pressure. Students interested in adopting a healthier and more compassionate diet can visit www.peta2.com to receive a free vegetar -
ian/vegan starter kit.

One of us is Muslim, the other Jewish.
But we share one thing in common: We are 
both pro-Israel in view.
You ask, “How can you then be critical of the Israeli 
government’s policies?”
Our desire for Israel’s long-term prosperity is rooted in 
the adage, “Dissent is the best form of patriotism.” Blind 
support for Israel — like we see among certain UF stu-dents — has never been productive, neither for the sup-porters nor for the government.
Let’s get real. A critical analysis of Israel’s policies to-
ward the Occupied Palestinian Territories, based on hu-man rights’ groups reports and other unbiased third par -
ties, is absent from the political discourse in this country.
This comes as no surprise.Israel has been the largest re-
cipient of U.S. foreign aid — not Haiti or the starving African countries — since World War II, much of it being in military weaponry.
To expect the media in the U.S. 
to provide a fair coverage of Is-
raeli policies is a little better than 
expecting the Soviet newspapers in the 1960s to provide a 
fair coverage of Castro’s Cuba.
To be fair, many students are genuinely confused.They’re skeptical of American-biased coverage, but 
they wonder, “Doesn’t Israel have a right to self-defense being under constant rocket attacks from the Palestin-ians?”
The rockets fired from the Palestinian territories have 
to be contextualized. Palestinians are not subhumans who have an irrational lust for death and destruction in Israel. Their terrorism is born from having lived under Israeli military occupation for the last 45 years, the longest-last-ing military occupation in modern times. The UN Human Rights Council’s 2008 report merits citation:
“[Palestinian terrorism] must be condemned and have 
been condemned. Common sense, however, dictates that a distinction must be drawn between acts of mindless ter -
ror, such as acts committed by Al Qaeda, and acts com-mitted in the course of a war of national liberation against colonialism, apartheid or military occupation. While such acts cannot be justified, they must be understood as be-ing a painful but inevitable consequence of colonialism, apartheid or occupation … In the present international cli-mate it is easy for a state to justify its repressive measures as a response to terrorism — and to expect a sympathetic hearing. Israel exploits the present international fear of 
terrorism to the full. But this will not solve the Palestin-
ian problem. Israel must address the occupation and the violation of human rights and international humanitarian law it engenders, and not invoke the justification of terror -
ism as a distraction, as a pretext for failure to confront the root cause of Palestinian violence — the occupation.”
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict will come to a swift end 
when Israel ends its brutal military occupation of the Pal-estinians. This isn’t our opinion but that of the UN Hu-
man Rights Council.
How do we put pressure on Israel to stop its oppres-
sion of the Palestinians?
Easy. If the rest of us — who still have a moral con-
science — tell Congress and the Obama administration to 
suspend all military aid to Israel until it ends its human rights violations, let’s see how long Israel can maintain its subjugation.

Speaking OutAfter riding a school bus nearly my entire elementary 
through high school career and riding the RTS bus at UF for two years, I’ve had the opportunity to observe 
several surprising similarities and interesting differences be-tween these two modes of transportation.
Obviously, there’s the differences in technology and taste 
you would see on the bus (like Kindles or paperback books, Lisa Frank Trapper Keepers or physics homework, and pat-ty-cake songs or furious texting), but here are some more you might not have considered.
Similarities:Both types of buses come in contact with passengers who 
are extremely confused as to where they are or where they’re going.
For the college buses, this can happen to freshmen, but 
mostly it happens after dark around 2 a.m., when the bars have let out and the stumbling masses begin to filter into any vehicle capable of taking them home.
Just like you wrote your bus number on your hand for the 
first couple days of grade school, drunk college students are mentally counting on themselves to remember which Later Gator bus to catch — A, B, C, D or F.
And when it comes to vomiting, I’ve seen it happen on 
both types of buses, filtering down the aisle in between seats, usually accompanied by crying.
Just like old school days, there will always be someone 
at least once who runs full speed, backpack flopping, deter -
mined to make it in the bus door before it closes. Sometimes they make it, and sometimes they don’t. But it’s always kind of funny seeing them run and not make it.
That hasn’t changed since elementary school.There’s also a great opportunity for the procrastinators to 
spend the bus ride working on homework they didn’t finish. Unless the RTS bus is full, and you have to stand.
Which brings me to my next point.Differences:In the old days, there was no missing the bus just because 
“FULL BUS”  was plastered on the front (I’m looking at you, No. 38). There was no worry that you were going to be late for an exam because of something out of your control.
The bus always came, and if it 
didn’t, your teachers would be noti-fied, and you would have a legit rea-
son for coming late or not coming at all.
There was no standing on the bus and holding onto what-
ever you could find because the bus driver stopped too short, and there were no awkward crotches in faces or standing un-comfortably close to a stranger who has B.O.
In school buses, you always had a nice, safe place to sit 
and catch up on your homework, trade Pokemon cards or feed your Giga Pet.
Probably my most prevalent point in these differences is 
the fact that in school, you pretty much knew the people on the bus and were able to sit where you wanted. On an RTS bus, anyone with $1.50 is allowed to ride. 
And by anyone, I am including that smelly hobo that sits 
right next to you, even though there is an entirely empty bus, and you’re afraid to even turn your head an inch for fear he might start up a conversation.
In my experience, RTS buses are more awkward than 
school buses. While buses in the old days were relatively 
noisy in the afternoons after school, RTS buses are usually 
quiet, except for the occasional girl with the annoying voice who talks loudly on her phone about nothing anyone wants to hear; the only people spared from the speech being those who have become accustomed to wearing headphones, the universal sign for “don’t talk to me.”
School buses were usually filled with chatter, but RTS bus-
es are usually filled with iPhones scrolling through Twitter or uncomfortable stares either at the ground, out the window or 
behind the person who thinks you’re staring at them.
Finally , there was never any weird voice declaring, “Stop 
requested. For your own safety , when crossing the street, 
please pass behind the bus.”
I can’t imagine any RTS bus driver that hasn’t had night-
mares about this voice at least once.

� DRENCHED IN CHOCOLATE WILL 
OPEN NEXT MONTH. 
SAMANTHA BLACK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville will soon be home to a 
chocolate shop with products that have 
as much variety as Willy Wonka’s Choc-
olate Factory.
Drenched in Chocolate will have its 
grand opening Dec. 15 and Dec. 16 and 
will include guest presenter Paris Them-
men, who played young cowboy fan 
Mike Teevee in the 1971 “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.” On Dec. 16, Themmen is scheduled to present a golden ticket to Mayor Craig Lowe as 
part of the shop’s official opening, said 
Drenched in Chocolate co-owner Kay Owens.
The shop will open its doors before 
the grand opening, probably about Dec. 7, but Owens said the exact date is still being set.
The store will be located at the Mill-
hopper Shopping Center on the corner 
of Northwest 16th Boulevard and North-
west 43rd Street, and the grand opening events will be from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Dec. 15 and noon to 5 p.m. on Dec. 16.
Owens said the prices will range from 
99 cents to about $1.50 a piece.
While the main shop is opening in 
December, a kiosk selling a selection of their chocolate is planned to open next 
week in The Oaks Mall, which will be 
run by Owens’ 21-year-old son Zach.
“It’s right next to the child’s play area,” Owens said. “We thought that might be a good idea.”
Owens, who has been making choco-
late for 25 years, comes from a family of confectioners. Her mother owned a doughnut shop, and her brother was a chocolatier.
Owens said Drenched in Chocolate 
will sell traditional treats such as fudge, caramel-covered apples and marshmal-lows that are all made in the shop. It will also have some out-of-the-ordinary 
goods, including chocolate spaghetti, 
chocolate-covered bugs and chocolate toothpaste.
Another distinctive characteristic 
Drenched in Chocolate will provide is 
chocolate photography, which allows 
customers to scan photos or other im-ages onto their chocolate.
“It’s a relatively new technology,” 
Owens said. “The image is scanned onto the chocolate as a thin layer of sugar.”
For their artisan collection, the choc-
olate is made from ingredients from around the world such as cinnamon 
from Ecuador and Devon cream from 
England.
Lizzy Wetzel, an 18-year-old UF zo-
ology freshman, said she looks forward 
to visiting the shop to cure her sweet 
tooth.
“If I hear the word chocolate, I’m 
happy,” she said.
As far as a target audience for 
Drenched in Chocolate, Owens said it aims for the audience its name suggests: chocolate lovers.
“Whatever your chocolate mood, we 
have you covered,” she said.Chocolate shop of pure

An artificially sweetened panic swept 
through Jenn Prevot’s family last weekend.
As news of Hostess Brands’ bankruptcy 
spread, the 19-year-old food science and hu-
man nutrition sophomore had to act fast.
“My stepdad said we have to stock up 
so we can have it for the rest of our lives,” Prevot joked. “We went to three different supermarkets because they were all sold out. It was like like an epic journey for Ding Dongs, Ho Hos and Twinkies.”
Hostess Brands announced Friday it 
would begin to wind down operations im-mediately after declaring bankruptcy. The 
company cited disagreements with unions 
for their faltering finances.
But there’s a glimmer of hope. On Mon-
day, Hostess Brands and one of their big-gest unions agreed to a mediation session in hopes of avoiding a Wonderbread-less world, according to the New York Times.
The two groups will meet today. If no 
deal is reached, Hostess will go back to court 
on Wednesday to push for a close-out plan.
The feasible end of Hostess’ products re-
sulted in the brand’s fans rushing to stores 
to scoop up as many treats as they could find.
Bobby Nellis, a customer service repre-sentative with the Butler Plaza Publix Super Market, located at 3100 SW 35th Blvd., said after Hostess’ bankruptcy went public, the store offered half-off discounts on all the 
manufacturer’s products the store had left 
in stock.
Nellis said his Publix sold the last of its 36 
remaining boxes of Twinkies on Saturday.
“I heard plenty of people looking for 
Hostess products,” Nellis said. “(Custom-ers) said that everywhere else was sold out, too.”
Local restaurants may also feel backlash 
from the brand’s potential bankruptcy.
Munchies 420 Cafe serves fried Twinkies 
drizzled in the customer’s choice of sauce.
Cameron Douglas, the restaurant’s 
kitchen manager, said it’s hard to say what the loss of the dish’s signature ingredient will do to Munchies’ dessert menu.
“It’s one of our top-selling dessert items,” 
Douglas said. “We haven’t made any deci-sions about what to do yet.”

Kicker Caleb Sturgis was named a finalist for the Lou Groza Award, and punter 
Kyle Christy was named a finalist for the Ray Guy Award. Florida is the only school to have both specialists selected to the list of three national finalists.alligatorSports.org
Visit our site during the break for coverage of all UF sports, including the football team’s game against FSU on Saturday. Carlie Needles scored 27 points and made a school-record nine threes as UF beat North Florida 7 4-44 on Monday. See story, page 16. The demise of Hostess would have 
counted Twinkies as one of the victims of a tough economy , but it 
would have been good riddance, right?

The Fighting Irish (-1.5) will roll, 
pat and mark the T rojans with a “B,”

USC has been the most disappoint-

fin was supposed to have a legitimate 
national title contender on his hands. 
You can’t judge a cake by its decora-tive frosting. Or the frosted tips in Matt Barkley’s hair. Notre Dame punches its ticket to Miami.

USC (+1.5) will lift the spirits of 
Twinkie fans against the Irish be-cause...
Just like Hostess a week ago, these 
Trojans are on the brink of collapse. Lane Kiffin’s job security is about as solid as the cream filling of a Twinkie. 
But USC has defeated Notre Dame

Florida entered the season without a 
clear-cut starter at quarterback. Now the 
same questions return for the Gators as 
they head to Tallahassee for a critical road 
matchup on Saturday in their final regular season game of 2012.
Sophomore Jeff Driskel, who started 
nine games under center this season, will return from a sprained right ankle he suf-fered against Louisiana on Nov. 10. Fellow sophomore Jacoby Brissett completed 14 of 22 passes for 154 yards in Saturday’s 23-0 
win against Jacksonville State.
 “We’re going to see how the week goes,” 
coach Will Muschamp said of Driskel’s 
chances of starting. “I don’t know. I know 
right now, based on yesterday, that he will 
play in the game. How much he’s going to play, whether he’s going to start, I don’t know that right now.”
No. 6 Florida (10-1) must beat No. 10 
Florida State (10-1) at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday in order to remain in the national title dis-cussion. UF is currently ranked No. 4 in the BCS. 
The Gators have dropped the past two 
meetings against the Seminoles, including a 21-7 loss at home last season after which Muschamp called his team “soft.”
The second-year coach feels the Gators’ 
offensive line is better equipped to combat the Seminoles’ top-ranked defense.
Florida turned the ball over four times 
and ran for 54 yards last season against 
Florida State. Brissett entered the game at 
the end of the first half.
Driskel gives the Gators a running threat 
at quarterback. “That’s coach’s decision,” Brissett said 
on Saturday after defeating Jacksonville State. “Hopefully we can get Jeff back fast and whatever [Muschamp] decides, be ready for.”
As the Gators’ offense contends with the nation’s No. 1 defense, UF’s fourth-ranked 
defense has to deal with redshirt senior 
quarterback EJ Manuel, who was a fixture in Heisman Trophy discussions earlier this season.

Coach Will Muschamp isn’t 
worried about style points.
Although an impressive win 
against Florida State combined 
with a Notre Dame loss on Sat-urday would likely land UF in the national title game, Mus-
champ doesn’t care about mar -
gin of victory.
To him, the Gators’ record 
speaks for itself.
“You play in our league and 
you play in some of the ven-
ues we’ve gone and played in, and regardless of what it looks, how it looks — my wife told me I was sexy after the game,” 
Muschamp said. “We don’t win 
sexy, but she said ‘You’re sexy.’ That’s a positive. She was kid-ding.”
Florida has not had many 
sexy wins this season, and Sat-urday’s 23-0 victory against Jacksonville State wasn’t one of them. 
The offense only scored one 
touchdown against the 108th-ranked defense in the FCS. Eight FCS schools scored 23 points or more against the Gamecocks 
this season.
The Gators’ average margin of victory is 16.3 points — the 
lowest for any of the 11 teams in UF history that have won 10 or more games in a single season.
Defensive tackle Omar Hunt-
er said the players are fine with winning tight games.
“That’s just our style,” Hunt-
er said. 
“That’s just how we play 
football. We love winning those hard-fought games. Those are the games that really show peo-ple how tough this football team 
is, the ones that go in the fourth 
quarter. You have to battle your way through.”
Muschamp reiterated that he 
wanted his team to avoid focus-ing on other games. 
The Gators need only worry 
about beating the Seminoles on Saturday. 
“We’ve got to take care of 
business Saturday,” Muschamp said. Muschamp, Gators fine with winning ugly

“That’s just how we play

Omar Hunter
UF defensive tackle“That’s my message for our football 
team today at 3 o’clock. Let’s under -
stand what’s at stake and what’s impor -
tant, and that’s focusing on the game.”Seminoles’ front: Florida State boasts 
one of the nation’s top pass rushes.
Seminoles defensive ends Cornellius 
Carradine and Bjoern Werner are tied 
for eighth and 12th in the country in sacks, respectively. 
Carradine has recorded 10.5 sacks 
this season, while Werner is only one behind.
Florida ranks 109th in the country 
with 32 sacks allowed. 
Florida State ranks No. 24 in the 
country with 28 sacks this season. The Seminoles also boast the nation’s No. 5 pass defense, allowing 165.6 yards per game on an NCAA-best 4.9 yards per 
attempt. 
“Carradine and Werner are the two 
ends that you know kind of start it for 
them,” Muschamp said. 
“They’re really good pass rushers. 
They create vertical separation, and they do a nice job of creating some problems.”
Injury update: Offensive tackle Chaz 
Green and fullback Hunter Joyer should both be ready to play against Florida State on Saturday, Muschamp said on Monday. 
Both players are expected to return 
to practice today.
Green left Saturday’s game with an 
ankle injury and Joyer sat for nearly the entire game after suffering a left thigh injury on Florida’s first offensive play.
Muschamp added that linebacker 
Neiron Ball and wide receiver Andre Debose would return to practice today and play on Saturday. 
Ball didn’t play against Jacksonville 
State on Saturday after suffering an ankle injury the previous week against Louisiana.
Debose has not played since Oct. 27 
against Georgia after injuring his knee in practice on Nov. 1.

rating, 2,311 yards, 66.7 comple-tion percentage, 14 touchdowns, 6 interceptions; 792 rushing yards, 4.6 yards per carry, 20 touchdowns.
Klein’s campaign took a major hit as Kansas State suf-fered its ﬁ  rst loss of the season, 52-24 to Baylor. Klein matched his inter-ception total from the Wildcats’ ﬁ  rst 
10 games by tossing three against the Bears. Klein also completed 27 of 50 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns while rushing 17 times for 39 yards and a score.  Klein’s 20 rushing touchdowns are tied for No. 2 in the NCAA.5. �� Braxton Miller, Ohio State 
quarterback (5 points): 137.1 passer 
rating, 1,850 yards, 56.8 completion percentage, 14 touchdowns, 6 intercep-tions; 1,214 rushing yards, 5.9 yards per carry, 13 touchdowns. 
In a week of disap-
pointing performances for Heisman hopefuls, Miller was only mildly underwhelming in Ohio State’s 21-14 overtime win at Wis-consin. He completed 
10 of 18 passes for 97 yards and notched 23 carries for 48 yards, failing to record a touchdown for the ﬁ  rst time all season. Miller ranks third nationally among quarterbacks with 110.4 rush-ing yards per game. 1. � Johnny Manziel, Texas A&M 
quarterback (20 points): 155.1 passer 
rating, 3,047 yards, 67.7 completion 
percentage, 21 touchdowns, 7 intercep-
tions; 1,114 rushing yards, 6.5 yards 
per carry, 17 touchdowns.
Manziel continued to 
stuff the stat sheet in Texas A&M’s 47-28 drubbing of Sam Houston State. The freshman sensation completed 14 of 20 passes for 267 yards and three touchdowns with an interception. 
He also ran 16 times for 100 yards and two scores. In the process, he became the ﬁ  rst freshman in NCAA history to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for 
1,000.
3. � Marqise Lee, USC wide 
receiver (9 points): 107 receptions, 
1,605 receiving yards, 15.0 yards per catch, 14 touchdowns; 107 rushing yards, 9.7 yards per carry. 
Lee continued to put up monster numbers as the Trojans continued to slide. Although USC fell 38-28 to UCLA for its fourth loss of the 
season, Lee made nine catches for 158 yards and a touchdown. The sophomore has eight games with at least 100 yards and seven games with double-digit catches. He leads the nation in both recep-tions and receiving yards.

Florida coach Will Muschamp walks around The Swamp and waves to the 
fans after his team’s 27-20 victory against Lousiana on Nov. 10.Leading off with a 58-38 record is Rivals.
com’s Bryan “I’m Not Embarrassed” Holt, 
who refused to admit his hometown of Tampa 
has let him down by flat-out refusing to attend the Buccaneers’ biggest game of the season 
against division rival Atlanta this weekend. 
Tampa just won a thriller to move to 6-4, but more than 7,400 tickets remained as of press 
time. Hey , Holt, if a cannon fires at Raymond 
James but no one is there to hear it, did it really make a sound?
Ranking second at 55-41 is the Miami Her -
ald’s Matt “It’s only two tires, bro” Watts, who 
actually asked a colleague for two tires off his 
car so Wattsy could go pick up his impounded whip, which has two flats. If Watts ever needs 
a kidney transplant, don’t get too close to him. 
He may not ask permission next time.
Sporting bronze at 53-43 is alligatorSports 
editor Greg “I eat quarterbacks for breakfast!” Luca, whose obsession with Jadeveon Clowney 
has transcended fandom. Luca constantly 
shoves past people at the office like they’re a bunch of helpless Xavier Nixons while bellow-
ing primal yells. Greg, you’re a 5-foot-9 white 
kid. Embrace who you are, man.
In fourth with a 52-44 record is The Associ-
ated Press’ Mark “Let’s make fun of the South!” Long, who took a little too much pleasure in 
watching a YouTube video of some Alabama 
fans celebrating Oregon’s loss on Saturday. Mark, we already know you live vicariously 
through down-on-their-luck Southerners. Just 
don’t be so blatant about it, you Honey-Boo-Boo wannabe.
Kicking off the latter half of the standings 
at 50-46 is alligatorSports writer Josh “Matt E-
llama is good at football” Jurnovoy , who still 
cannot pronounce the name of the Gators’ star safety after covering the team for more than 
three months. We would insult you further, but 
frankly this is just sad.
Sitting in sixth with a 49-47 record is the 
Palm Beach Post’s Jason “Room temperature flow” Lieser, who believes 65 degrees is just 
too damn cold for a run. Hey , Jason, there are 
these great indoor facilities people use called gymnasiums. Or you could just man up, you 
Twinkie.
Avoiding the cellar at 46-50 is alligatorSports 
assistant editor Joe “You clearly just don’t un-
derstand the politics of Valdosta” Morgan, who berated a columnist from the Valdosta 
Daily Times for having the audacity to suggest 
that something should be done to improve Val-dosta State’s attendance. Nobody goes because 
nobody cares about Valdosta football. Grow up 
and get over it. 
And in dead-ass last with a piss-poor record 
of 44-52 is alligatorSports.org editor Adam Daniel Pincus, who is, uh, himself. Boom! 
Roasted.

CarradineDEFlorida needs best game 
to top dominant FSU
  Manuel, who has 21 touchdowns against six interceptions, 
has played like a senior quarterback should play, Muschamp 
said. 
  The second-year starter averages 270 total yards per game.  “Every week we’ve been facing pretty much a quarterback 
that can run and is physical, can step up in the pocket and take hits,” linebacker Jon Bostic said. “This will be no different.”
  Since losing to N.C. State in Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 6, the 
Seminoles have averaged 40.2 points per game. While the Seminoles’ offense has recovered since the early season loss, the Gators’ offense has been stuck in a rut.
  Florida takes pride in sustaining long drives but has con-
verted eight of 38 third-down tries the past three games. 
  “We have to play our best game against FSU,” Brissett said. 
“We have to come out sharper on ﬁ  rst and second down. ... We have to be sharper in the red zone.”
  Saturday marks the 57th meeting between Florida and FSU.  
Both teams have top-ﬁ  ve defenses. 
  Muschamp isn’t interested in speculating on who will take 
the snaps at Doak Campbell Stadium. He’s focused on devel-oping a game plan, no matter who Florida’s quarterback is.
  “I met with the offensive staff [Monday] morning about ... 
the things we’re going to need to do in the game to be success-ful,” Muschamp said. “We’ll detail that as the week goes.”

In his first game back from a three-game suspen-
sion, Scottie Wilbekin was an integral part of a key 
Gators run.
With 12:32 remaining in the second half, the junior 
point guard studied his options at the top of the key 
and then dished the ball to redshirt senior guard Mike 
Rosario. As Wilbekin beat a Middle Tennessee de-fender on a backdoor cut, Rosario lobbed him the ball for an easy lay-in. 
The score capped off a 10-0 run, increasing Flori-
da’s lead to 42-28 and helping it distance itself from Middle Tennessee in a 66-45 win on Sunday. After the Blue Raiders called timeout, Wilbekin’s teammates embraced him. 
“[Wilbekin] gave us a little boost,” junior forward 
Will Yeguete said. “We really missed him, and I’m glad he’s back now.”
In 23 minutes off the bench, Wilbekin finished with 
eight points on 3-of-6 shooting. The effort was only three points shy of his career best, which came Nov. 18, 2010, against North Carolina A&T in Wilbekin’s third career game.
He also tallied three assists, two steals and two 
turnovers against Middle Tennessee.
“This was a game that was maybe up his alley a 
little bit, because I think Scottie is a tough, physical, hard-nosed kid,” coach Billy Donovan said. “That’s the way Middle Tennessee State plays. (It was) just a game where Scottie was able to do some good things for us in the minutes he played.”
Wilbekin struggled to find any rhythm in the first 
period but bounced back with a six-point, turnover-free second half.
Donovan suspended Wilbekin for undisclosed 
reasons on Nov. 8, one day before Florida’s season opener against Georgetown aboard the USS Bataan in Jacksonville. Wilbekin rejoined the team on Friday after missing victories against Alabama State and Wis-consin. 
“I’m not too much of a prideful guy, but it was 
really humbling seeing the team do great, because it 
proves I’m not bigger than the team and no player is 
bigger than the team,” Wilbekin said. 
Before the season, Wilbekin was slated to start at 
point guard. Since Wilbekin’s suspension, senior Ken-ny Boynton, a natural shooting guard, has occupied the position.
Donovan said Wilbekin would have to earn the 
starting role. He will come off the bench again when No. 7 Florida (3-0) hosts Savannah State (3-2) tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
“I’m not thinking too much about that — starter or 
come off the bench,” Wilbekin said. “I’m still going to play, and I’m still going to work hard. It is what it is.”

Facing an opponent from 
the Sunshine State for the sec-
ond consecutive game, redshirt 
freshman Carlie Needles made it rain Monday night.
Needles scored 27 points, 
boosted by a school-record  nine three-pointers on 17 at-
tempts, to help Florida (3-1) 
beat North Florida (0-4) 74-44 in the O’Connell Center. With 
the win, UF bounced back 
from Tuesday’s 98-67 loss to Florida State.
“My teammates really 
looked for me,” said Needles, who did not know she broke 
the program record. “Without 
them, I wouldn’t have shot the ball well.”
In Florida’s first three 
games, Needles averaged just 4.7 points per game and at-
tempted only 12 threes. Her 27 
points more than tripled her previous career high of seven. 
The nine threes tied 
Needles for second most in Southeastern Conference his-
tory and broke Bridget Pettis’ 
UF record. Pettis made eight threes against Georgia on Jan. 
20, 1993, and held the record 
alone before Needles’ historic night.
“When she got hot, we just 
didn’t do a very good job of finding her in her zone,” North 
Florida coach Mary Tappmey-er said. “She’s a phenomenal shooter, and if you let that kind 
of shooter get her feet set, she is going to knock them down 
on you.”
Florida trailed 5-2 four min-
utes into the first half before taking command of the game 
with a 19-0 run.  
“I didn’t like the way we 
started the ball game,” Butler said. “It was defense, though, that turned the tides. We dug 
our heels in and decided we 
were not going to play even.”
Needles’ 
performance came in the absence of 
f r e s h m a n 
C h a n d l e r Cooper,  
perhaps the 
Gators’ best three-point 
shooter. 
Cooper missed the game af-
ter suffering a strained arch in 
her left foot last week. 
Butler said she hopes to 
have Cooper back in the lineup when Florida faces N.C. State 
on Friday at  the South Point Thanksgiving Shootout in Las 
Vegas.  
If not, the Gators may have 
found a new shooter to lead 
the team.
“There was nothing that 
was lucky or [a fluke],” Butler said. “[Needles] did a great job, and every shot she took was a 
good shot.”Guard sets UF record
