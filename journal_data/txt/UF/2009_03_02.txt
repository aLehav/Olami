ORLANDO — No more cuts.This was the message brought 
by 6,000 teachers, parents and stu-dents who gathered Saturday to raise awareness about education 
cuts.
The Make Our Schools a Prior-
ity Rally featured speakers who 
gave personal testimonies about their experiences with Florida’s 
poorly funded public education 
system.The rally emphasized the need 
for those who care about public educa-tion to contact local and state politicians 
and express their opinions.
About 35 UF students attended 
the rally.Mark Pudlow, Florida Educa-
tion Association spokesman, said FEA realized the budget cuts were taking a toll on public schools last fall.
When it comes to education 
funding, Pudlow said Florida is at the bottom compared to the rest of the country and has the largest 
class sizes.
Kali Davis, a UF graduate stu-
dent in elementary and special 
education, was asked by FEA to speak at the rally as the voice of 
pre-service teachers, college stu-6,000 rally to oppose state education cuts

A half-mile west of the Devil’s 
Millhopper, Ed Kellerman stood in his living room crammed with electric guitars, amplifiers and drums, glued to his TV screen with his son, Dillon, watching replays of his son’s basketball game. 
“They ended up losing to their 
rival team,” Ed said. “But what matters is that they stuck it out un-til the end.” Ed, a UF professor and com-
munications direc-tor of the Harvest of Hope Foundation in Gainesville, moved 
to his dining room table, which was surrounded by hand-painted Buddhist artwork on all four walls. On the floor, hundreds of Harvest of Hope Fest posters lay strung to-gether, awaiting their destination: stapled to wooden street posts.
He opened his laptop display-

University Police Department Officer Gene Rodgers saw 
a man in a lifted black Chevrolet truck swerve, and Rodgers 
flipped on his lights to reign in the driver.  
The driver told Rodgers he hadn’t been drinking, and he 
successfully followed a pen with his eyes. The man said he’d 
swerved because he’d been texting.
The pullover was a part of a saturation detail in which 11 
officers, two on bicycles, three on motorcycles and the rest in marked and unmarked cars, patrolled University Avenue 
primarily scouting for drunken drivers. The night resulted in 
one DUI arrest.
Additionally, UPD made five other kinds of arrests, gave 
48 traffic tickets and 58 warnings, UPD Lt. Stacey Ettel said.
“The goal of the detail isn’t to give out tickets or make ar-
rests,” he said. “It is to saturate the area so that drivers see the presence of law enforcement and make better decisions.”lOCAl

Tree trimmer killed after crane accident,  likely electrocuted
A Gaston’s Tree Service employee was killed Saturday after being 
electrocuted while working. When the man was dumping mulch with a 
crane at 21812 N.W. 91st St., the crane accidentally broke a set of power lines, said Alachua County Fire Rescue spokeswoman Carol Davis.
Davis said when the man got out of the truck he was electrocuted 
because he touched the truck and the ground at the same time. The hy-draulic fluid from the crane leaked onto the broken power lines and started a fire, Davis said. Officials have not been able to determine if the man’s death was a result of the electrocution or the fire, said Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Steve Maynard.

Family and casual bowlers 
can be frustrated by league bowl-
ers, who sometimes show up in groups of 100 and use all of the lanes.
League bowlers can have their 
concentration interrupted by those who aren’t taking the game 
as seriously.
To please both sides, Splitz has 
three different sets of lanes: the 
traditional style, plus “Boutique” lanes and the “Stockroom.”
Boutique lanes have lounge 
couches and feature big screen projectors at the end of the lane, which often show sports or can 
be changed to the bowler’s prefer-
ence.
The Stockroom is a similar but 
more secluded set of lanes.
Prices vary depending on the 
lane type and increase after 5 p.m.

Stanley Tate, the founder of 
the prepaid program, opposed increases at the meeting.
He said the increases, which 
will cause prepaid tuition plan prices to rise, will put the plans out of reach for families with lower incomes.
“We’re gonna do whatever 
we can to fight it,” he said.

New bowling alley opens
There’s a new bowling alley 
in town, and it’s trying to rein-vent the business.
Splitz, an expansion of Skate 
Station Funworks, opened on 
Friday, just off Newberry Road.
Funworks also offers mini 
golf, rock climbing, go-carts and 
other attractions. Plans to add Laser Tag in April are in the works.
“We’re hoping to make this 
sorta like a mini-Disney,” said Katie Connolly, a manager at 
Splitz.
Connolly said that there are 
generally two different bowling 
communities, league and casual. Hikes won’t hurt Prepaid
The Prepaid College Board will 
likely have to shell out billions of dollars more in tuition payments over the next few decades under an agreement made last week.
The board, which oversees 
Florida’s prepaid tuition plans, will have to pay between $2 billion and $3 billion more to the state’s 11 universities over the next 24 years, said Florida Board of Governors spokesman Bill Edmonds.
The agreement, passed by the 
Board of Governors during Thurs-
day’s meeting, still needs to be ap-
proved by the state Legislature.
Under the agreement, the pre-
paid program will be required to increase its tuition payments be-tween 6 percent and 6.5 percent each year for contracts sold be-tween July 1, 2007, and the date the Legislature approves it.
The increases will hold at that 
level even if tuition is goes up by more than that amount.
The increases are being sought 
to minimize the impact of students who would be exempt under a proposed tuition law that seeks to allow all state universities to raise tuition by 15 percent each year un-
til they reach the national average. 
Students with prepaid tuition 
plans would be exempt from the 
potential tuition hikes, but Thurs-day’s agreement would force the prepaid program to cover a por-tion of the increased tuition costs for some of those students.
The agreement does not affect 
students and their families, Ed-monds said. “This will not cost parents a single dime,” he said.
It also will not affect the prepaid

The last six complaints filed 
among parties during the Student 
Government elections campaign season were discussed in an hour-long Elections Commission meet-
ing on Friday.
Frank Bracco, president of the 
Keg Party, and the Orange and Blue 
Party each filed three complaints.
Bracco filed two complaints 
against the Progress Party, but only one was voted to be a violation. 
Elections Commission members 
fined the Progress Party $1 for fail-ing to label a campaign picture dis-
played in its Facebook group as a 
registered political advertisement, a break from  the $10 fines the party has received in the past. 
“They’ve been fined enough,” 
said Daniel Thompson, a member of the commission.
Another complaint claimed the 
Progress Party misrepresented it-
self through the use of a campaign 
poster featuring Lil Wayne and Ba-rack Obama.
“We wanted to keep campaign-
ing lighthearted,” said Sen. Ben Dictor, the Progress Party’s presi-dential candidate. “The Student Body is smart enough to realize this is a joke.” 
The Orange and Blue Party re-
ceived its first violation of the elec-tion, also filed by Bracco. He said the party displayed two signs in Turlington Plaza, instead of the al-lotted one, a rule outlined in the 700 codes, a part of SG’s constitution 
that outlines proper campaigning tactics to be followed during elec-tions.
The Orange and Blue Party was 
given a warning and a public rep-
rimand. 
The last three complaints heard 
were filed by the Orange and Blue Party against the Unite Party, which received a warning and public rep-rimand for two of three violations.
The party cleared the third com-
plaint, which involved Unite fliers stuck on top of Domino’s Pizza boxes and delivered throughout Gainesville. One box ended up at an Orange and Blue Party meeting. 
“Well, we’re happy y’all got our pamphlet,” said  Unite Party Presi-
dent Will Harrell.
Cain Norris, an Orange and Blue 
Party member, argued campaign 
materials are not supposed to be distributed in bulk, but instead must be delivered hand-to-hand via party supporters. 
Harrell asked if a pizza delivery 
employee could fit the definition of 
hand-to-hand delivery.
The Progress Party also had fli-
ers handed out along with pizza 
orders through Five Star Pizza, ac-cording to Eric Conrad, the party’s communication director. No com-plaint was filed.

� UPD WAS ARRESTING
UNDERAGE DRINKERS.
By ASHLEY roSS 
Alligator Writer 
 
The University Police Depart-
ment shut down a  philanthropic 
dodgeball tournament at UF’s Norman Field on Saturday after underage drinking arrests involv-
ing participants were made in the 
neighboring parking garage.Phi Delta Theta Fraternity and 
Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority hosted the Ultimate Dodgeball Philanthro-py, which was held  to raise money for Lou Gehrig’s disease through donations and team registration fees.
Lt. Pam Bonner of UPD said the 
event was shut down because it presented an issue of public safety.
As of Sunday night, Bonner said 
she was unsure how many arrests were made.
But according to  Phi Delta Theta 
Fraternity’s philanthropy chairman Alex Akar, at least 15 people were arrested for underage drinking in Norman Garage. 
“We were out there raising mon-
ey,” Akar said. “And that is more 
important than a few kids slamming down beers in the parking 
garage next door.”
Bonner refused comment on any 
fundraising that may have been  in-
hibited by the early shutdown.
Bonner said the fundraiser came 
to a halt after an officer, who was conducting security checks on So-rority Row, noticed numerous ve-hicles parked illegally around the field.  
Byron Oldham, president of Phi 
Delta Theta, said the tournament kicked off at 10 a.m. 
After hearing that a few stu-
dents in the garage had been ar-
rested around noon, Oldham said 
he  began spreading the word to participants on the field that police were patrolling the garage.
Chairman Alex Akar said UPD 
threatened to shut down the event around 12:15 p.m.When both hosting organiza-
tions offered to hire more secu-rity to prevent the shutdown, UPD would not allow it, he said.  
Akar said two bouncers were on 
duty during the event to ensure no one entered the field with alcohol.
Akar said the event was ex-
pected to raise more than $10,000, adding they may now fall short of the goal. 
Jamie Dollinger, president of the 
Panhellenic Council, said no deci-sions have been made about sanc-tions regarding either organization.

� ABOUT 230 ATTENDED THE EVENT 
SATURDAY NIGHT.
It turns out rock bands have it all wrong. 
Drums and guitars aren’t needed to cre-
ate modern, catchy music — it just takes a 
group of voices.
On Saturday night, 230 people gathered 
in the Performing Arts Center at P.K. Yonge to watch a cappella ensembles from across the state compete in the 2009 International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella South Region quarterfinals. 
The competition featured two groups 
each from UF, Florida State University and the University of Central Florida. Each 
team performed three or four songs for three judges. 
Performances ranged in style from the 
somber resonance of The Beatles’ “Black-bird,” sung by the FSU’s Reverb, to the 
fast-paced, energetically choreographed rendition of Tally Hall’s “Banana Man,” 
performed by UCF’s Crescendudes.
Several groups also sang modern hits 
like Duffy’s “Mercy,” dedicated to Tim Tebow by all-female UF group The Sedoc-
taves.
FSU’s AcaBelles won first place, and Re-
verb from FSU won first runner-up.
The Sedoctaves, who perfomed in hot 
pink stilettos and matching belts, hosted 
the event and were named second runner-
up.

Local antique show raises money for end-of-life care
By HUNTER SIZEMORE
Alligator Writer
jhsizemore@alligator.org
 
Frances Kirkpatrick felt like she 
was entering a lottery as she wait-
ed in line at a local antique road-show Saturday.
A vase, a Japanese figurine and 
a bracelet were all potential jack-pots, and she was there to have them appraised.
But it’s more about the fun of 
antiques than the money, she said.About 70 people had about 160 
items appraised during Haven Hospice Attic’s Antique Road-show.
Haven Hospice Attic held the 
show to raise money for end-of-life care. The store carries thrift and antique items. Participants paid $5 per antique appraisal, with a three-item limit. In addition, the extra traffic that the show brought earned the Attic several thousand dollars more than usual.
John Sikorski, the appraiser and host of the local antique appraisal radio show Sikorski’s Attic, esti-mated the values of items, pointed 
out what con-tributed to 
or detracted 
from an item’s 
worth and suggested where peo-ple could find out more about their items.
He appraised items span-
ning from a pair of antique Patek Philippe watches, which could sell for thousands a piece, to a metal infant’s coffin, for which he didn’t know of a market.
As Kirkpatrick stood in front of 
Sikorski’s table holding her three antiques, the appraiser set his eyes 
on the Japanese figure, a sitting 
woman holding a planting pot. 
Sikosrki felt that there was no 
market for the figure, valuing it at less than $15.
The bracelet, made of painted 
mother-of-pearl tiles framed in sil-ver, was quite a find, Sikorski said. The markings and style led him to believe it was Persian and he appraised the jewelry at between $250 and $500.
The vase, a wedding gift to 
Kirkpatrick’s mother, was worth 
between $50 and $100 according to 
Sikorski. 
“It was exciting,” she said after-
wards. “I don’t plan on selling any of it though.”
The show’s most expensive item 
was a Martin acoustic guitar from 1975. Sikorski estimated its worth  beteween $5,000 and $7,500.

personification of the folk music dream.
Ed recalled his days in New York, 
when the folk movement was coming 
into light more than 40 years ago.
On one outstanding night in Green-
wich Village, there was Bob Dylan play-ing over at the Troubadour and Joni Mitchell singing over at Café Noir — they were all young; they were all ideal-istic. They all joined hands and worked on what they dreamed as a universal community. 
This community, he said, is the phi-
losophy behind a grassroots production such as Hope Fest. And after years of benefit shows by punk rockers Against Me! and other friends, the foundation stays afloat with more than $750,000 giv-en as aid to migrant families for medical and general expenses.
“Every time we run out of money, we 
never despair,” he said. “Something al-ways happens.”
The Struggle 
Eventually every migrant worker 
makes his or her way out, Ed said. 
Take 76-year-old Willie Green, a for-
mer Ocala migrant farmer turned blues 
guitarist who will play a set on Saturday afternoon. 
But Green’s story came with the ter-
ritory. In the ‘40s, the city of Archer was 
filled with black farmers, Ed said. The 
‘70s brought a large Hispanic farming 
population from Mexico and other coun-tries. Since then, migrant workers strug-gle to find work, pay their bills and feed 
their children. 
Enter Ed and his brother, Phil Keller-
man, 53, who began the Harvest of Hope 
Foundation as a toll-free hotline for mi-grants to call for financial help in 1995. 
That year, their grandmother, Helen 
Zand, a long-time advocate for the poor, passed away. They took $60,000 worth of the inheritance and started the founda-
tion. 
They say they give a hand, and not a 
handout, Ed said. 
“They have to prove that they can 
help themselves and that they’ve ex-plored other avenues,” Ed said. 
But their endowment plummeted af-
ter the 2004 hurricane season. There was 
no work to follow for migrants in central 
Florida and the Panhandle, but Phil still 
received hotline calls from workers with transportation issues and utility pay-ments.
“I’ve had a migrant woman cry on the 
phone when we help them out for keep-ing their lights on,” said Phil, president of the foundation. 
Despite financial uncertainty, they 
couldn’t give up, Phil said. 
“What can you do when they call up 
for funds? Are we going to sit there say-ing, ‘No, we’re saving money for a rainy day’? No, because a rainy day happens 
every day.”
Two years ago, Against Me! played at 
Common Grounds and went on to play 
in Georgia, Illinois and Arkansas — sell-
ing out shows and giving set money to 
the cause. 
“Migrant farm working is something 
I’d always been aware of, and we want-ed to do something that was active and 
positive,” said Tom Gabel, lead singer of 
Against Me!.
Gabel, now a St. Augustine local, and 
the band will headline the Hope Fest 
Saturday night. The festival expects to 
attract more than 15,000 people over the weekend.
“It’s amazing it’s grown the way it 
has,” Gabel said. “We’re just another 
band on the bill and happy to be a part 
of it.”

Iguana: It’s what’s for dinner.
Iguana was one entrée choice for about 
750 attendees of the UF student chapter of the Wildlife Society’s 26th annual Beast Feast Saturday night.
The feast, which was held at UF’s horse 
training facility, served a variety of strange meats beginning at 5 p.m., including bobcat, octopus, rattlesnake, python, water buffalo, alligator, hog, elk and red deer.
The meat was donated by game farms 
and individual hunters, said Ashley Wil-liams, president of UF’s Wildlife Society. The Florida Museum of Natural History 
provided the python.
As the only student chapter in Florida, 
the society provides certifications, per-
forms road cleanups and offers education programs at elementary schools, said Elise Brumer, the society’s vice president.
Williams said about 750 tickets were 
sold and that the event cost between $3,000 and $4,000.

GOP redemption may lie in education
Steering clear of Los An-
geles County might be in the best interests of 
sailors and truck drivers ev-erywhere — at least for the 
first week of March.
A campaign by 15-year-
old McKay Hatch has led to 
an upcoming proclamation from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors desig-nating the first week of March as “No Cussing Week.” While spewing expletives won’t re-
sult in a ticket or even a slap 
on the wrist, Hatch hopes to raise awareness and encour-age people to be more con-scious of their word choices.
At least Hatch didn’t 
take a page from a school in Canada where students faced suspension for being repeat 
cussing offenders.
Hatch’s efforts to curb 
cursing are not limited to one 
week of the year as he formed the “No Cussing Club,” which features a Web site, bright orange T-shirts and its very own theme song.
Available on YouTube, 
the music video for the song depicts Hatch and his en-
tourage roaming the streets 
of Pasadena as they chide people for their inappropri-ate language.
The reverberating mes-
sage? “If you wanna hang with us, I don’t wanna hear ya cuss.”
The Editorial Board ap-
plauds Hatch for his dedi-cation to cleaning up the mouths of both children and adults alike across South-ern California. His ideology is not about forcing people to stop swearing, but rather hoping that increased civil-ity while communicating can 
help solve bigger problems.
Everyone from professors 
to students can afford to heed 
Hatch’s message to create a community at UF where pro-fanity is less commonplace.From commander-in-chief to leader of the free world, 
you can add another moniker to President Barack Obama’s growing list of titles — regular guy.
Attending Friday’s basketball game between the Chicago 
Bulls and the Washington Wizards, Obama shed his Burberry suit in favor of a more relaxed collarless shirt as he sat court-side with a friend. Not only did Obama spend his evening free from thoughts about the federal budget and economic crisis, he also purchased a beer (with his own money) and enjoyed making small talk with a young fan seated nearby.
Nothing like the most powerful man in America channel-
ing his inner everyman.
Even though Obama is widely regarded as an avid Bulls 
fan, Wizards small forward Caron Butler made sure that the 
game did not start before the president arrived in his seat — 
if only to catch a glimpse of the man as he walked in. Butler even went as far as to encourage the refs to allow the teams to spend extra time warming up and lightheartedly asking them if they wanted to play tic-tac-toe.
The ploy worked, as Butler was able to witness the en-
trance of his hero and direct fist bumps toward Obama after each shot he made over the course of the game.
The Editorial Board can’t help but crack a smile knowing 
that our president is someone we would actually enjoy hang-ing out with in our rare moments of free time. We think it is awesome that Obama can take a few hours out of his busy week to kick back and relax just like the rest of us. 
Maybe next time the Wizards can work him into the half-
time entertainment — imagine Obama launching a half-court shot to win one lucky fan a new car.
Despite nearly being dead, the GOP can still put on 
a great show. 
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, once hailed as the 
next Barack Obama for the GOP, resurfaced last Tuesday berating President Obama’s address to Congress. Jindal’s rebuttal speech came after the first tonally gratifying Presi-dential address to Congress in eight years, and it fell hum-
bly flat. The Louisiana governor never had a chance with a 
speech he delivered by channeling his inner Mr. Rogers. 
Not only was the rebuttal condescending, but it was 
also lacking in reason and logic; instead reverting back to the tenants of conservative principles, unoriginally derid-
ing “tax and spend” Democrats.
And that moment, when Jindal referred back to prin-
ciple instead of reality, is when the modern Republican 
Party died. 
Undeniably, there are a few remnants of the once 
Grand Old Party. Republicans like California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who have accepted the stimulus bill money for their states, are exam-ples of moderate Republicans, who instead of being hailed 
as the saviors of the party, are dismissed as cop-outs to the 
holy canon of conservatism. Last week, Gov. Jindal took to the Sunday talk show circuit, pledging not to take the money the stimulus bill had already set aside for his state. 
Later, the American public found out Jindal would re-
ject a whole two percent of the stimulus money. Oh boy!
Again, Jindal exemplified why America is tired of the 
Republican Party: Another Mr. Rogers character preaching moral values only to be caught with his pants down in the 
proverbial Minnesota bathroom stall.
This country needs a two-party system, but with the 
GOP effectively dead, our government is split between a faction of ideologues and a 
majority of pragmatists. Repub-licans desperately need to re-
invent themselves, not just for 
their sake, but for our democ-racy’s sake.
Conveniently enough, I have 
a plan for their political redemp-tion: refocus on education.
For far too long, Republicans 
have constantly stressed the importance of a sound educa-tion system, but they have only gone as far as initiating 
vague educational mandates without providing adequate 
funding to school districts. Instead of trying to fix our state deficit by cutting education, increase the tax on cigarettes and tobacco products that will ultimately lessen the bur-
den on our health care system. Instead of forcing school 
districts to lay off thousands of teachers and personnel, damaging the quality of education Florida’s students re-ceive, create revenue by taxing alcohol. Instead of cutting the funding for higher education, damaging the caliber 
of future Floridian workers, simply cut other areas of the 
budget. 
College students across the state of Florida understand 
that increased access to quality higher education will ulti-
mately curb our economic woes, and they will be rallying 
in Tallahassee on March 4 to demand the attention of the State Legislature. I’d suggest that our Republican lawmak-ers listen. 
It may not be the principled conservative decision, but 
it will be the smart one.

Guest column
Would former President George W. 
Bush or former Vice President Dick Cheney have committed the 
United States to invading Iraq if either of them had done substantial tours of duty in the military? 
More than likely not. With this being the case, one would won-
der how it is that the majority of Ivy League 
universities in the U.S. continue to ban Re-
serve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) pro-grams on their campuses. Since the Vietnam 
War, many Ivy League institutions have 
closed their doors to ROTC programs in re-
sponse to the unpopularity of combat during 
that time period. 
While the Vietnam War has been over for 
decades, many of Ivy League institutions still have not restored their ROTC programs. 
There are reasons for this, some openly stated, some not. 
One of those reasons is opposition to the 
“don’t ask, don’t tell” policy currently in place within the military services. While on the surface this would seem like a justified reason, it is not. 
The problem with this reasoning is that 
the military has no say in policies like “don’t ask, don’t tell.” 
It was our elected officials who imposed 
that policy, and only those officials can repeal it. Punishing the military for something it has 
no control over is wrong and unfair.   
Some would also defend the policy by 
claiming that letting ROTC come back to 
those universities would “militarize” the student bodies of those campuses. This argu-
ment holds little weight. 
UF currently has all of the major branch-
es of the military represented on campus though ROTC 
programs, yet few individu-als would char-acterize the UF 
student body as militant. 
Instead of making campuses militant, Ivy 
League universities having ROTC programs would ensure that the men and women that 
one day will lead our nation have a deep un-
derstanding of the sacrifices the military re-quires, which would make them think twice 
before unnecessarily putting troops in harm’s 
way or committing foolish military actions.  
During my time in the military, two of 
the most outstanding officers that I knew were graduates of the Ivy League. One was 
from Brown University, and the other from          
Columbia University. 
How many great leaders from these uni-versities has the military missed out on? 
During last year’s campaign, President 
Barack Obama surprised many during a speech held at his alma mater of Columbia by criticizing Ivy League universities for not al-lowing ROTC programs.
Obama’s statements, however, should not 
have surprised anyone. As a former commu-nity organizer, he clearly understands the im-
portance of serving other people. 
Thankfully, pressure from the new admin-
istration is helping bring about changes. 
Schools such as Harvard University and 
Yale University are currently considering in-viting ROTC back — a step in the right direc-
tion. 
Hopefully, this will continue and result 
in bringing ROTC back to all the Ivy League universities in U.S.

 Ivy League should allow military to provide ROTC on campus

Speaking Out8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 2, 2009
Logan Jaffe / Alligator 
Hebrew Harmony
Students of congregation B’nai Israel perform “Greased Lightning” Sunday to a full crowd. The students, who also performed 
scenes from “High School Musical,” sang in Hebrew.
Rodgers said he is the “go-to guy” for 
DUIs.
On average, UPD makes two DUI arrests 
per night, he said.
UPD usually patrols the streets around UF 
like Archer, Southwest 13th Street and West 
University Avenue.
“We like to stop them before they get on 
campus,” Rodgers said.
To spot a DUI, Rodgers said he looks for any kind of traffic violation like going through red lights, weaving or having headlights off.
Rodgers said that a DUI could potentially 
ruin anyone’s life short term. 
Not only does it cost about $10,000 for a 
lawyer, Rodgers said, but the judge can also implement a curfew.
Other consequences may include losing 
jobs, driver’s licenses. 
He said he doesn’t feel bad about doing his 
job, but he does empathize with people who get in trouble. 
One good thing about being a police officer, 
Rodgers said, is that he can make his own deci-
sions about when to be hard on someone and 
when to let someone go.
“There’s too many bad people out there to 
get the good people,” he said.Six arrests made during drunken driving saturation detaildents that teach as a part of their 
curriculum.
“I am appalled by the empty 
promises when it comes to edu-cation,” Davis said at the rally. “They don’t understand that high quality public schools are essential 
to the quality of this state.”
Davis, president of the student 
chapter of the Florida Education 
Association at UF, said in order for those who care about public edu-
cation to get what they want from 
the government, they have to take a stand.
Davis interns in a third grade 
class at Joseph Williams Elemen-tary School in Gainesville.
She said that because of poor 
funding, Joseph Williams stu-dents have art class one semester 
per year because they share an art 
teacher with a local elementary school.
Although teachers are fighting 
for better pay and planning peri-ods, Davis said it is for the good of the students.
“It is all part of the quality edu-
cation; they deserve to grow up 
and be successful,” she said.
President of the UF FEA Sarah 
McGarrah, an elementary educa-
tion senior, said Florida public 
schools aren’t the only ones that 
are hurting from budget cuts.
UF is tossing around the idea 
of cutting the undergraduate pro-grams of education and nursing, 
she said.
“Cuts are coming at us from 
any angle,” Davis said. “Cuts in 
education do not heal, and shame 
on anyone who doesn’t under-
stand that.”Teachers

Over the past few days, UF received 
verbal commitments from Char-
lotte (N.C.) Independence High’s 
Victor Hampton and Bradenton Southeast 
High’s Jonathan Dowling, two promising defensive backs.
They’re both fast and highly rated, 
and Hampton is even from former Gators quarterback Chris Leak’s alma mater.
The two commitments give UF six for 
the 2010 recruiting class, and despite the fact that most Web sites haven’t even re-leased rankings for most of the players, people are already speculating that the 
Gators will have the nation’s best class 
next year.
Tackle Ian Silberman, quarterback Trey 
Burton and safeties Demar Dorsey and 
Matt Elam round out the list, but don’t get 
too attached to any of those names.
Their commitments are all meaning-
less. Not meaningless in the way that all non-binding verbal commitments are, 
but on another level.
There are 11 
months left before 
National Sign-
ing Day, and even 
though these kids think committing 
to UF will make the 
other schools leave them alone, it won’t. 
Now, those other coaches vying for 
their signatures have a specific target to at-
tack — the Gators.

With the Gators down just 5 
points and 16 seconds still left on 
the clock, fans began to file out of 
the O’Connell Center.
At that point, they must have 
known what was coming.
Volunteers forward Tyler Smith 
scored 19 points Sunday and Ten-
nessee (18-10, 9-5 Southeastern Con-ference) beat UF (21-8, 8-6 SEC) 79-75.
It was the Volunteers’ fifth 
straight win against the Gators and their seventh in the last eight con-tests.
With the loss, UF’s 17-game home 
winning streak came to an end.
It was the team’s first home loss 
this year.
“I can’t say they just have our 
number because there are always 
different players in the game, but we 
just have a hard time (with them),” said guard Erving Walker, who fin-ished with 16 points.
Tennessee came into the game 
as the conference’s second-worst 3-point shooting team.
They knocked down 10 against 
UF, with seven coming in the first half.
The Volunteers made 12 during 
their win against the Gators earlier this year in Knoxville.
Tennessee has shot 32 percent 
from downtown this season against the rest of the SEC but has man-aged to average 48 percent in its two meetings with UF.
“We have a hard time guarding 
them on the perimeter,” UF coach Billy Donovan said.
“Their speed and athleticism, 
without question, 
causes us prob-
lems.” 
Tennessee shot 
78 percent from long range and 
66 percent from 
the field in a first half that saw the 
Volunteers lead by as many as 15 points.
Smith hit a leaning 3-pointer at 
the buzzer, and Tennessee took a 45-33 lead into halftime.
Meanwhile, the Gators struggled, 
shooting 39 percent from the field in 
the first half.
“When you get down that much, 
it’s hard to come back,” forward Chandler Parsons said. “We fought,

Tennessee defeats UF for seventh time in eight tries
Oral commitments meaningless

UF’s road woes continue.
The No. 17 Gators (23-6, 9-5 South-
eastern Conference) failed to overcome Georgia (17-12, 7-7 SEC) on Sunday, al-lowing the Bulldogs to shoot 52 percent and falling 84-75 in Athens, Ga.
The defeat was the fourth in the last 
five games for UF and the third straight away from home.
Despite the loss, the Gators had al-
ready secured a first-round bye in the SEC tournament after LSU defeated Ten-nessee on Thursday.
UF will be the No. 4 seed and will 
play Friday night against the winner of the game between No. 5-seed Tennessee and No. 12-seed Alabama.
Still, based on the Gators’ effort 
against Georgia, they won’t be entering the postseason on a high note.
“The story of the game was not our 
shooting,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. 
“It was not the shots that we took. It 
was the shots that we gave up.”
The Gators trailed 45-38 at the break 
but came out in the sec-ond half playing tighter defense and captured the lead.
UF stayed in front 
until about midway 
through the second half, when Georgia slowly began to re-claim the momentum.
Butler had only one explanation for 
what happened.
“You can’t press at that crazy, neck-
break pace for an entire 20 minutes, no matter how deep you are,” Butler said. UF WOMEN’S BASKETBALLGators lose on road againSEE HOOPS, PAGE 15

Any momentum UF had built 
up after a 5-0 start to the season was 
swept away by Miami on Sunday afternoon.
The No. 24 Gators lost to the Hur-
ricanes 16-2 at McKethan Stadium, their worst defeat since Vanderbilt thumped them by the same score in Gainesville on April 2, 2006. 
“I really didn’t see this one 
coming today,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “I thought we would come out and play well. I’m not quite sure I remember a game 
like this for a long time.”
UF (5-3) narrowly lost the first 
two games of the series 8-5 and 2-1 
on Friday and Saturday, but the Gators couldn’t keep the final con-test close after falling behind early. 
Freshman Nick Maronde made 
his second career start, missing his spots early and often. He left the 
game in the fourth inning with two 
outs and the bases loaded, surren-dering 4 runs in the inning.
Miami first baseman Harold 
Martinez led off the fourth with a homer for the first run of the game. Six runs, three hits, three walks, a hit batter and an error later, freshman Justin Poovey finally recorded the 
third out for the Gators. 
“We were ready to go from the 
get-go, and once they jumped out to 
a lead, we just rolled over,” UF se-nior Brandon McArthur said. 
O’Sullivan used five pitchers, 
and only one of them, Jeff Barfield, who pitched the ninth, was able to keep Miami from scoring a run.
The Hurricanes (6-1) put at least 
1 run on the scoreboard in five dif-ferent innings. 
“When the wheels fell off in the 
fourth, they fell off for everybody,” O’Sullivan said. “We just didn’t get anything out of the pen today.”
The offense wasn’t exactly on 
fire, either. 
Miami starter Iden Nazario held 
UF in check over his five innings of work, striking out seven while al-lowing just 2 runs on two hits. 
“He threw everything over the 
plate early and challenged guys,” Miami coach Jim Morris said. “He established himself in his second start as a pitcher, and those types of starts will keep him in the rotation.”
The Gators struggled at the plate 
all weekend and wasted a solid Saturday start from freshman Alex 
Panteliodis. The Hurricanes held 
them to just 1 run Saturday, though UF recorded nine hits.
O’Sullivan said his team failed 
to put good swings on the ball in hitter’s counts, chased pitches that were out of the zone and rolled over sinkers from the Miami pitchers. 
The second-year coach has used 
a different lineup in each of UF’s games thus far and plans to keep moving players around until he finds a productive order.The weekend’s frustration finally 
boiled over in the seventh inning 
Sunday when right fielder Riley 
Cooper slid into second base to try to break up a double play. 
The umpire signaled Cooper out and ruled that he interfered with Miami second baseman Scott Law-
son. The batter was then also ruled 
out, and Cooper was ejected.
Cooper exchanged shoves with 
Lawson and Miami left fielder Jona-than Weislow before UF’s bench cleared and cooler heads prevailed. 
“It was just the heat of the mo-
ment,” Lawson said. “He slid kind of late, and his momentum carried him past the bag. No big deal.”MONDAY, MARCH 2, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15

UF BASEBALLGators drop all three games against Hurricanes
to listen eventually.
I don’t blame these kids 
for committing. UF is an ex-
cellent place to play right now, and if the coaches are offering scholarships, they should take them. But verbal 
commitments, especially this 
early, are made to be broken.
Recruiting is too often 
looked at from the schools’ perspectives. It’s about filling needs and strengthening next year’s team, but it’s also about 
high school kids finding the 
place that’s best for them, and that process takes time.
Hampton told The 
Gainesville Sun he has never visited UF. 
He said he’ll check it out 
sometime this month, and he doesn’t plan on visiting any other schools.
Also, an Independence 
coach told The Sun that 
Hampton’s recruiting process 
only took two weeks.
Sure, if I were a big time 
recruit, the Gators would 
be near the top of my list no 
matter how far away I lived, but I’d at least have a list and work my way through it.  
By not visiting other schools, Hampton is doing himself a huge disservice, and Urban Meyer should discourage 
him from following his cur-
rent plan. 
If Hampton doesn’t do any 
looking around and he makes an uneducated decision, that 
could come back to bite him 
when he gets to Gainesville. 
It’s much better to find out 
where he fits best during the 
recruiting process, because if 
he doesn’t discover that until 
he gets to UF, there could be trouble. 
No one wins if he’s upset 
or transfers.
Of the five players who 
committed before June 1 in the recruiting classes from 
2005-2007, only two (Aaron 
Hernandez and Chris Rain-ey) are still in Gainesville. The other three transferred.
There are lots of rea-
sons why players trans-fer, but it certainly doesn’t help to enter the recruiting 
process with your mind 
made up, like Hampton is.  
And with all six of the current commits, how can Gators fans 
really feel good about them? 
Look at this past year, 
when UF lost Greg Reid 
(committed to UF in February 
2008) to FSU and Nu’Keese 
Richardson (committed May 2008) to Tennessee.
The way I see it, the Gators 
just have something to lose now.MIKE , from page 14
but when you get down like that, it hurts.”
The Gators chipped away at the Volunteers’ lead 
in the second half, almost closing the gap.
Back-to-back threes from Dan Werner and Walk-
er and two foul shots by Nick Calathes (20 points) 
cut the lead to 3 with 1:30 to play.
But again, the Gators failed to finish late in a 
close game. 
Five UF fouls in the last 2:04 gave Tennessee 
enough free throws to hold on for the win.
“They have to understand what kind of plays 
that really affect the outcome of a game,” Donovan 
said. 
“They have to understand that their margin for error is not very good.”
With just two games left in SEC play, the Gators 
are once again scrambling for their NCAA Tourna-
ment lives.
“Each game that goes by is more important. We 
don’t have many left,” Werner said. “We didn’t fig-ure it out last year, so honestly I don’t know (if we will).”
With games against Mississippi State and Ken-
tucky still on the schedule, UF will likely have to win out to safely land a spot in this year’s field of 65.
“Last year, we weren’t even in the ballpark of be-
ing a good team. But we’re right there now. We’re 
just missing a few things,” Werner said. 
“If we can figure them out, it can be a successful 
year still.”
“So when there was a little bit of a 
lull, they took advantage of it. We got a little bit too tired to trap and pressure the ball on every single possession like we started the ballgame.”
The Bulldogs put the Gators 
away with a 3-pointer with three minutes remaining, pushing their lead from 4 to 7.
UF was never able to recover.“We just let them score at 
will,” Butler said. “We let them score how they wanted to score. We let them have the shots that they wanted, and you’ve got to give them credit, they didn’t miss them.
“It was ridiculous,” she added. 
“ N o t h i n g 
against Geor-gia, but that’s not their thing to score a bunch of points on you. That’s 
not how they’ve won ballgames this year.”
Forward Marshae Dotson tried 
to carry the Gators down the stretch, scoring 22 points, but it wasn’t enough.
Sha Brooks struggled to com-
plement Dotson’s effort. The se-nior guard was held to just 13 points and had six turnovers.
Georgia forward Porsha Phil-
lips added 20 points of her own on the low block, and Bulldogs guard Ashley Houts posted 14.
Butler said her team has to play 
better defense to win in the post-season.
“Every game is an away game 
now, and although it’s at a neutral site, you’re not going to be on your home floor,” Butler said. “And the one thing that you’re going to have to rely on is your defense and then also your rebounding.”

 Recruiting analysts have said the Gators’ 
2010 recruiting class would need to have a 
heavy dose of defensive backs. UF’s coaches must feel the same way.Jonathan Dowling, a 6-foot-3, 178-pound 
safety out of Southeast High in Bradenton, orally committed to the Gators on Sunday while on an unofﬁ  cial visit. He is the fourth commit of UF’s 2010 class who plays in the defensive backﬁ  eld.
Dowling had already narrowed his list 
down to UF and Alabama and has taken vis-its to both schools in the last week.
“Florida just feels, like, 
real family-oriented, and it just feels like, ‘That’s my home,’” he said. “Alabama, it just felt like a regular col-lege.”
Dowling spent Sunday with UF safe-ties coach Chuck Heater and was assured he would play that position if he chose the Gators.
Although signing day is almost a year 
away, Dowling wanted to end the recruiting process early.

ular kid because I’m closing the door.” Gators land fourth defensive back recruit for 2010 class By EUGENIO TORRENS

 The Gators had a good meet. The 
Bulldogs had an exceptional one.
UF set a new season-best score. Geor-
gia set season highs on all four appara-
tuses.
Add in a perfect 10 for the Bulldogs 
(10-0, 6-0 Southeastern Conference), and you have the recipe for No. 1 Georgia’s 198.2 to 196.65 win against No. 7 UF in Athens, Ga., on Saturday.
The Bulldogs’ score is the highest for 
any school this season.
“I feel like we went out and had a 
successful meet,” junior Melanie Sinclair 
said. “Considering we had to count a 
fall, I think we did really, really well to-night.”
As if having Georgia ﬁ  ring on all cyl-
inders wasn’t enough, UF (5-3, 3-3 SEC) again had to battle injuries with senior Corey Hartung taken out of the ﬂ  oor exercise and vault lineups because of a strained muscle in her left calf.
“It was an extremely difﬁ  cult situa-
tion of being short-handed,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. “She’s an All-Amer-ican every time on ﬂ  oor, so yeah, we know that hurts us.”
The Gators started the afternoon 
with a 49.275 on uneven bars. They were down from the ﬁ  rst event, as Georgia notched its ﬁ  rst of four season bests on 
vault, a 49.425.
The Gators followed with a 48.625 on 
vault, forced to count a fall suffered by 
Courtney Gladys because the team was only ﬁ  ve deep with Hartung scratched off the vault lineup.
Faced with Hartung’s absence again, 
the Gators responded by tying their sea-
son best on ﬂ  oor with 
a 49.45, including a 9.8 
from Gladys.
Amanda Castillo 
returned to the com-petitive ﬂ  oor lineup for the ﬁ  rst time this season. Castillo has been hampered by an-kle bursitis but exhibi-
tioned ﬂ  oor Feb. 20 against Alabama.
“Amanda’s getting closer,” Faehn 
said. “It was obvious tonight that she has that spark. That’s the ﬁ  rst step, and then getting her (routine’s level of) difﬁ  culty back.”
The loss at Georgia ended UF’s SEC 
play until the league championships be-gin on March 21 and also illuminated the 
Gators’ desperate need to get healthy.
“The key for us is we have to get 
athletes healthy,” Faehn said. “Or at 
least as healthy as they can be for us to ﬁ  eld a lineup. We just gotta get people healthy.” Georgia dominates UF

 It was a weekend full of wins for UF, 
but the Gators also suffered one very costly 
loss.
Senior Kim Waleszonia suffered an in-
jury to her left leg in the ﬁ  rst inning of the 
Gators’ 7-3 win against Texas Tech on Sat-
urday night. The center ﬁ  elder dropped a bunt and sped toward ﬁ  rst base, but when she was tagged, she ﬂ  ew through the air and landed in obvious pain. 
She remained on the ground for several 
minutes amid silence from the crowd, only to be carried off by her coaches.
Waleszonia was on crutches in the dug-
out during the Gators’ doubleheader Sun-day, but UF coach Tim Walton said he did not know the extent of the injury yet. 
“We’re going to miss her enthusiasm on 
the ﬁ  eld, but I’m sure she’ll make a quick recovery,” right ﬁ  elder Kelsey Bruder said. “We’re just all working together trying to keep the morale up.”
No. 2 UF (19-2) won all six of its games in 
the Cox Invitational held at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium this weekend. Junior Fran-cesca Enea celebrated her 21st birthday Sat-urday with three hits, three RBIs and a home run that smashed into the scoreboard.
The night before her injury, Waleszonia 
broke the career school hits record with an inﬁ  eld single. 
“She gets a hit almost every time I look 
up,” Walton said Friday. “To have played such a great schedule in her career and have that many hits just tells you what kind of a special player she is.”
The game in which Waleszonia broke 
the record — UF’s 10-5 win against Paciﬁ  c — also had special meaning for Walton, as it was the 300th victory of his career. Several hours later, Walton got win No. 301 in the Gators’ 8-0 victory against South Florida. 
Enea and pitcher Stacey Nelson (9-2) led 
the Gators to two more wins Saturday — a 9-1 beating of Illinois and a 7-3 win against Texas Tech.
Enea jumpstarted the Gators’ offense, 
crushing her sixth home run of the season.
When pitcher Stephanie Brombacher al-
lowed two more Red Raiders to get on base in the ﬁ  fth inning, Nelson came in to relieve the sophomore, and Texas Tech went hitless for the rest of the game. 
Nelson also relieved Brombacher on 
Sunday in the Gators’ 7-2 win against Il-linois. Enea and Bruder provided the ﬁ  re-power UF needed at the plate again Sunday, when they combined for four RBIs on four hits, including Bruder’s third home run of the weekend in the ﬁ  nal game of the tourna-ment, a 9-1 win against South Florida.
