With starting running back 
Matt Jones (viral infection) out for 
Florida’s season opener against Toledo, the Gators handed the running game to junior Mack Brown.
He did not fumble.In his ﬁ  rst college start, Brown 
rushed for a career-high 112 yards and two touchdowns, as No. 9 Florida ran the ball down Toledo’s throat to begin the sea-son with a 24-6 victory — the program’s 24th straight win in season openers.
“When you’re able to run the 
ball as effectively as we did, then we win the game,” coach Will Muschamp said.
Brown made his presence 
known on Florida’s ﬁ  rst drive of the game.
The junior running back ran 
on six of the Gators’ ﬁ  rst 11 plays and put UF on the board with a 1-yard push through the middle. The score was Florida’s ﬁ  rst open-ing-drive touchdown in a season opener since 2009.
Brown was responsible for 
the Gators’ second touchdown as well. With Florida up 10-3 after a  ﬁ  eld goal by Austin Hardin, Brown put the Gators ahead by two touchdowns on a 14-yard run over the left guard.
“I got butterﬂ  ies when I 
scored,” Brown said.
Said Muschamp: “Nothing 
shocks me of what he did today … I was expecting him to run hard, and he did.”
Brown’s 25 carries allowed 
Florida to dominate the time of possession as the Gators had control of the ball for nearly two-thirds of the clock.
“We wanted to run the ball 
because of what [Toledo does] of-fensively,” Muschamp said. “We did not want to get into an 80 (to) 90 play deal.
“Our game plan was basically:

After almost a year of construction, 
UF’s Theta Chi chapter held a grand 
opening ceremony for its new house Friday.
Nearly 350 alumni attended the 
event, but with their dates and fami-lies, the crowd swelled to about 700 people, said Theta Chi Administrative Vice President Kyle Rodriguez.  
“Two years ago, some of our alumni 
— the main one being George Kramer — started a campaign to build a brand-new, state-of-the-art fraternity house,” said the 20-year-old UF sustainability and the built environment junior. “It’s a pretty awesome house.”
The house cost $4.3 million to build, 
and it was ﬁ  nanced through about $2 million of chapter fundraising, alumni donations and a loan, Rodriguez said.
Friday’s ceremony lasted about an 
hour and honored various donors and active brothers. 
The event also featured the un-
veiling of two bronze Gator statues, which Rodriguez called “a gift for the alumni.” 
The statues were created by the 
same artist who made the Gator statue in front of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.

The Alachua County Health Department 
detected a signiﬁ  cant increase in mosquito 
populations due to the large amount of rain-fall last month. At the same time, 11 cases of mosquito-borne dengue fever have been con-ﬁ  rmed in Martin, St. Lucie and Miami-Dade counties, among other areas in South Florida.
During surveillance, which detected an 
increase in general mosquito populations, of-ﬁ  cials also noted an increase locally in Asian tiger mosquitoes — which can carry dengue fever, said Paul Myers, administrator at the Alachua County Health Department.
“If the virus continues to move through 
Florida, and you have good Asian tiger mos-quitoes in Alachua County, the virus could easily be introduced,” said Jonathan Day, pro-fessor of medical entomology at UF.
Alachua County could host the disease, 
Myers said, but an infected individual would need to come into the county and be bitten by a mosquito for the disease to take a foothold and spread.
“The fact that it is in the state, it certainly is 
a concern to public health ofﬁ  cials,” he said. “(But) we don’t have teeming masses of in-fected humans running around.”
During the normal mosquito season, popu-
lations rise after the wet summer months and into early Fall, Myer said. Generally the popu-lation dies down with the ﬁ  rst freeze.
Mosquito populations are actually lower 
than last year, which had Hurricane Sandy to blame for massive numbers, he said.
Still, the increase in mosquito population 
means one factor that increases the likelihood of dengue fever occurring in Alachua County has been fulﬁ  lled.
“So, you’re not immune,” Day said. “Ala-
chua County is not immune to this.”Mosquito populations are upSEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 16

Hare Krishna Lunch prices have 
gone up.
Until last October, students and 
locals could eat Krishna Lunch for 
a $4 donation. The request has since gone up to $5.
This isn’t the ﬁ  rst time prices 
have gone up. The lunch prices went from being optional to a man-datory donation of $3. Prices went up another dollar in 2008, according to Alligator archives.
Krishna Lunch Director Hanan 
Schwefel attributes the price change to the increase in food prices. Schwefel, who buys the groceries weekly, said quality ingredients are only becoming more expensive with time.
“A year ago, the (nutritional al-
mond) powder (used to make the salad dressing) cost $30 for a 30-pound bulk,” he said. “Now it’s $95 for the same amount. We try to use healthy ingredients ... and spend a lot to make lunch better.”
The part of the money that 
doesn’t go to food goes to the food truck’s gas and insurance, maintain-ing Krishna Lunch as a green orga-nization — meaning they’re using sustainable materials — and main-taining the kitchen, which is in-spected by the health department.
“It’s hard to ﬁ  nd good vegetar-
ian food on campus,” said Savan-nah Snowden, a 19-year-old  food science and human nutrition sopho-more at UF. “I really don’t mind $1 extra.”
Casey Miller agrees.“I still think it’s a pretty awe-
some value. I just got a bunch of food I get to take home, so it’s still a good deal,” the 21-year-old UF reli-gion senior said.
Those who eat at Krishna every 
day are protected from the price hikes. By buying ﬁ  ve meal coupons, each meal will cost $4. Buying 10 meal coupons, each meal will cost $3.50, Schwefel said.
Krishna Lunch is served on cam-
pus on the Plaza of the Americas or at the Krishna House, 214 NW 14th St.
Although there is an established 
donation request of $5, Schwefel doesn’t deny anyone a meal.
“The main thing is to feed them,” 
Schwefel said. “We have many stu-dents who help us in other ways. There are many other students who help us with serving, doing dishes with us.”

The ongoing Reitz Union renovations will 
shut down certain sections of the 46-year-old 
building until its completion in 2015.
Student organizations will take arguably 
the biggest hit. Space for them to meet and work is limited now, and “it’s going to get gradually worse,” Executive Director Eddie Daniels said last week at a forum.
Around the start of next year, the rooms 
on the third ﬂ  oor across from the Department of Student Activities and Involvement will become unavailable. From February 2015 to the redone Reitz’s debut later that year, Dan-iels said, the building will be virtually without room for student organizations.
“Meeting space in this building will be ex-
tremely limited,” he said.
The Reitz Union Rion Ballroom will be-
come unusable in February, when the space it currently occupies undergoes construction to become meeting rooms. Upon the project’s completion, the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom will be on the third ﬂ  oor, Daniels said.
The information desk and Student Govern-
ment Computer Lab have already relocated. Orange & Brew has been closed completely, and although the amphitheater isn’t being made over, it’s off-limits during construction.
Student Body Treasurer Jayce Victor wrote 
that groups could see challenges with room reservation — they may even have to use spac-es outside the Reitz or off campus to meet.
“Students as well as administration will be 
experiencing some changes in the upcoming year, but I believe that this is a moment that will empower us all,” Victor said.
Daniels said revenue from food court res-
taurants and the hotel could be impacted as well, but he hopes any negative effects will be minimal.
“We haven’t been through this before,” he 
said. “There are a lot of unknowns.” Reitz Union closures to affect student organizations until 20154, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2013

Journalism junior and current UF Theta Chi chapter brother Garrett Mastronardi, 20, talks with an 
FSU Theta Chi chapter alumnus Friday afternoon at the grand opening of the new Theta Chi house on UF’s campus. The new house cost about $4.3 million to build.
More than 500 donated 
money for the project
alty board of directors for 10 years, 
spearheaded the campaign. 
He said that there have been 
attempts to fund a new house in the past, but they were all unsuc-cessful.
“Most of the houses on the road 
are in need of renovation,” he said. “As the facility deteriorated, we knew it was something we had to do in order to position the fra-ternity to be able to continue at the university. It was reaching a point where we didn’t think it was go-ing to be able to continue to func-tion as a residence.”
Kramer called the grand open-
ing ceremony a “really satisfying culmination” of the efforts of him-self and the board.
“We started the capital cam-paign, which I chaired, back in April 2011 with zero dollars for the new house,” Kramer said. “Now, we’re at about $1.85 million and counting in pledges.”
The money comes from more 
than 500 donors, the greatest of which only donated $50,000, Kramer said.
“To have raised over a million 
dollars without a six-figure donor is impressive,” he said. “To get to almost $2 million without one is even more so.”
Although Kramer doesn’t have 
college-aged children yet, he said he remains hopeful that many generations of Theta Chi brothers will enjoy the house.
“We’re celebrating our cen-
tennial in 2016,” he said, “so it feels good knowing that we’ll be positioned at UF for the next 100 years.”

� SALES HAVE DECREASED BY ABOUT 20 PERCENT.
RJ SCHAFFER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The College Poster Sale Company has posted up some-
where else. The poster sale has moved down to the ground 
floor of the Reitz Union, and salesman Jeff Apostolou said he feels the move has hurt his sales.
“It’s definitely been a little bit slower down here,” the New 
York native said. “A lot of our business is impulse buying. They see the posters lying on the table, and they come over and buy it. We’re still doing OK down here, but we’re not doing quite as well as we would have at the Colonnade.”
The exhibit is a traveling poster sale exhibit based out of Yonkers, N.Y., that makes trips to various colleges around the country.
The company has been a regular to UF for about three de-
cades — with the majority of sales taking place on what used to be the Reitz Union Colonnade.
The poster sale’s new area is tucked away in a spot with less 
foot traffic. Apostolou said he feels as if the change in location has decreased sales by about 20 percent.
“The poster sale is something that I look forward to every 
time it comes,” said 19-year-old  accounting sophomore Nikki Masse. “I wasn’t even aware that the poster sale was here until the third day, and that’s unfortunate.”
Many students were totally unaware.“I didn’t really know about the location change,” said 19-
year-old psychology sophomore Melissa LaRosa. “I think peo-ple don’t walk by this (the new location) as much as they did the other location.”
The university approached Apostolou prior to construc-
tion beginning and offered him options for the next step for his business. One option was being fully outside, something that concerned Apostolou due to Gainesville’s weather.
Reitz Union Executive Director Eddie Daniels said the uni-
versity kept the organizations in the Reitz Union in mind while going into the construction process.
With all of the student involvement on campus, Daniels 
said he thinks it is imperative that they have a space to be able to thrive in the future.
“We are the student union,” Daniels said. “If we’re not do-
ing things that are appealing to students and that students en-joy being engaged in, then we’re not doing our job.”Poster sale previously on Reitz Colonnade hung up on new locationKATHRYN VARN

Planned Parenthood of North Florida wel-
comed its newest president and CEO Thurs-
day night at at a reception in Gainesville.
Elizabeth Fraley, who hails from Cali-
fornia’s Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, is replacing Staci Fox, who moved up to head Planned Parenthood Southeast.
Fraley said she looks forward to tackling 
issues experienced by women in the South.
“They’re the types of issues that we 
weren’t dealing with in California because it’s a very different environment,” she said. “I felt that I could be much more effective here than in California.”
Planned Parenthood of North Florida has 
three centers in North Florida, including the Gainesville Health Center, which has seen about 3,100 patient visits out of a region total of 8,100 visits so far this year.
As the newest leader of the region, Fraley 
said one of her goals is accepting outside in-surance before more women become eligible for and receive health insurance with the im-plementation of President Obama’s Afford-able Care Act, which takes effect Jan. 1.
Many Planned Parenthood centers across the country already accept outside insur-ance, she said, and other Florida centers are in contracts with insurance companies to start allowing this. Fraley said she plans to springboard North Florida to this point.
“I’m very glad to be in a position where 
I can affect change so that women who are newly insured under the Affordable Care Act can continue to come to Planned Parent-hood for very much needed reproductive services,” she said, adding that women who are still uninsured can continue coming after 2014 begins.
UF telecommunication and history soph-
omore Kylie Lacusky, president of UF Voices for Planned Parenthood club, said she agrees with the directives Fraley outlined.
“It would ... be a service to the UF and 
Gainesville community if the Gainesville clinic accepted outside insurance,” the 19-year-old said. “Ms. Fraley’s goals could have a lot of positive impact on our area, which we’re very grateful for as a club.”
Fraley also plans to bring her region up-
to-date with electronic record keeping and education program expansion. And a couple years down the road, she anticipates offer-ing limited primary care so women can be treated for more than reproductive issues.Planned Parenthood director

Coffee shop owners in some major cities 
are waging war on the “laptop squatter,” 
but in Gainesville, it’s the least of business owners’ worries.
Shops in cities like New York, Boston 
and San Francisco are sealing power outlets, implementing passive aggressive signage and segregating laptop users to restricted areas. But Gainesville business owners are more focused on economic development.
“We’re just happy if people are even 
buying stuff,” said Roth Conrad, a barista at Maude’s Classic Cafe.
Issues associated with customers who 
fit the description of a laptop squatter differ considerably from the surrounding actual squatters who make no purchases.
“It’s mostly the homeless dudes who 
fall asleep in the B-room [back room of the café],” said Simon Nash, who has worked as a Maude’s barista for a year. “But it’s also annoying when people leave their trash be-hind from Mochi and Starbucks.”
Gainesville establishments like Maude’s 
have few policies regarding Wi-Fi usage that are actually enforced.
“It should be understood that if you’re 
a coffee shop, a huge amount of your busi-ness is centered around people using Wi-Fi,” Nash said. “There’s jokes about wheth-er we’re actually a coffee shop at all. We’re more of a venue for chain-smoking and people watching.”
Some local establishments are slightly 
more restrictive.
At Coffee Culture, the Wi-Fi password 
changes daily and can only be obtained with a receipt after purchase.
When connecting to the Wi-Fi provided 
at Volta Coffee, Tea & Chocolate, users are greeted with a message on their laptop screens reading “Don’t be a camper.”
“Camping is way different when cus-
tomers actually make a purchase,” said Volta barista Meghan Marvin. “We have customers who come in every day, order like a pot of coffee and sit for hours.”
Keeping this long-staying clientele is 
both essential to the business and pleasant to work around, she said.
“I actually really appreciate being able 
to be a part of all of the work happening around me,” said Marvin.
Gainesville resident Jan Zamojski said 
he spends about six to eight hours in coffee shops on an average weekend.
“The coffee is almost a formality,” 
Zamojski said. “It’s more of a ceremonial rite of passage than the reason I am here.”We-Fi: Using cafes’ Internet OK

A local agency for veterans is cur-
rently accepting applications for foster 
caregivers — or angels, as Don Nolder calls them.
A 77-year-old Marine Corps vet-
eran, Nolder recently moved to a lake house in Keystone Heights to live with Theresa Dunn and her husband.
A military incident left him re-
stricted to a wheelchair, and it became harder for him to live independently.
“I couldn’t do things that most 
people take for granted,” Nolder said.
He first heard about the Medical 
Foster Home Program in Jacksonville, and once it was set up in Gainesville, he became the first to find his match.
The Veterans Health System re-
cently expanded its Medical Foster Home Program for veterans who can’t live alone due to health problems. The nationwide program launched locally in October 2012.
Since then, the Gainesville-area program has been in touch with 25 prospective caregivers but just recent-ly made its first match so far.
“Within the first 10 minutes, we 
knew he was family,” Dunn said.
Nolder said the move has been a 
positive change.
“My daughter notices the change 
in my voice when I talk on the phone,” he said. “I’m not depressed. It’s just a wonderful life here.”
Tanya Fookes, a local coordinator 
for the program, called offering foster home care “a labor of love.”
She said applicants must have a 
history in caregiving, own or rent their home and pass a background check plus a series of inspections.
“A lot of people seem to be con-
fused with the role of caregivers. It’s very rewarding,” said Dunn, a former certified nursing assistant.
Nolder refers to her as his “angel.”“Theresa impacts me every day she 
feeds me,” Nolder said, laughing. “It’s just good to know she is there, and all I have to do is holler.”Veterans program makes

� IT TEACHES ABOUT FIVE

A local driver’s educa-
tion agency, which frequently 
teaches international students how to drive, recently received a fleet upgrade.
North Central Florida Safety 
Council, a nonprofit commer-cial driving program located at 3710 NW 51st St., had been op-erating with just one vehicle.
Edwin Gardner, a driver’s 
training instructor at the pro-gram, said he was worried when the old car started hav-ing problems. With the con-stant parking, three-point turns and heavy braking, he said the damage to the vehicle can get expensive.
“The last thing to go out on 
the car was the turn signals,” Gardner said. “That’s when we realized we need a new vehicle soon.”
But to solve the woes, the 
driving program received a 2013 Chevy Impala to use for lessons, said Jeff Sims, the pro-gram’s executive director.
He said the new vehicle was 
necessary to continue offering driver’s ed to local students.
“There are many interna-
tional students that move to Gainesville for school,” he said, “and they don’t have much family or friends, or in some cases, many places to practice driving — so they come to us.”
Gardner said he teaches 
about five students a week. While the majority of his stu-dents is college-aged, he said half a dozen professors dur-ing the past two months have come to him. One was from Russia.
In one incident, Gardner 
said, he taught an international student who had never before been in a car.
“I have learned so much 
over the years,” he said. “The variety of students are from all over the place.”
Jorge Gomez, a 20-year-old 
UF business administration junior, said the importance of learning how to drive when coming to a new country is es-sential.
“When I came to this coun-
try, I knew how to drive, but many people don’t,” he said. “It’s important to learn the rules of the road.”

A government building in 
downtown Gainesville is undergo-
ing renovations to improve the ap-pearance of the area.
The Wilson Building, located at 
30 E. University Ave., houses space for local court services and Visit-Gainesville, an organization dedi-cated to tourism and marketing for Alachua County.
Donald Flemming, the construc-
tion site manager with Charles Perry Partners Inc., said the renova-tions include painting and adding new carpet and energy-efficient windows.
Roland Loog, the director of Vis-
itGainesville, said the renovations could kick off a trend.
“You work hard to make your 
downtown a nice city center,” Loog said. “As the government build-ing improves the storefront, other storefronts will follow.”
For now, the building stands 
with boarded windows and metal scaffolding masking the storefront, which slightly constricts sidewalk space.
But Tracy Shank, a frequent 
downtown visitor, said the nar-rower sidewalk has not become an issue.
“I work near the downtown area, 
and I have noticed the construction. The use of the sidewalk is still quite accessible,” Shank said.
Loog said he has not heard any 
complaints about the sidewalk.
“The only thing I have seen is 
someone get splashed by an RTS bus after a heavy rain due to the smaller sidewalk,” Loog said.
He said overall the improve-
ments will be worthwhile.
“The nicer the storefronts, the 
better it is for downtown,” Loog said.VisitGainesville office

As a newer Reitz Union goes up, the con-
struction is slowing some students and faculty 
down.
With the colonnade entrance from the 
North Lawn and the path from the Reitz Union bus stop fenced off, the construction is difficult to navigate for students and faculty in wheelchairs.Katie Shepherd used to arrive at the Reitz 
Union bus stop with 15 minutes to get to class. Now, the 20-year-old health education and behavior junior, who uses a wheelchair, must be on campus almost half an hour before her class.  
“I know they can’t just make a path through 
the construction,” she said. 
The Reitz Union is now only accessible 
through the entrances near Subway, Wells Far-go and the Welcome Center on Museum Road. Students and faculty in wheelchairs must go through a series of elevators and pathways to get to the other side of the building.
The UF Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA) Compliance Office Coordinator Ken-neth Osfield said he’s received no complaints from students.
“It is a pain, but it is still fully accessible,” he 
said. “People with mobility disabilities have to go out of their way to get around.”
He said the ADA office reviews four dif-ferent stages of the design process for every construction project on campus. The ADA Compliance Office worked with Reitz Union Project Manager Cydney McGlothlin to make sure the construction arrangements were com-pliant with ADA standards.
The renovated Reitz Union will have ac-
cessible restrooms on every floor and a new entrance to the Colonnade, which Osfield said always posed a challenge for students in wheelchairs.
Reitz Union renovations get in way for wheelchair-bound “You work hard to make 
your downtown a nice city 
center.”

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Have you ever bought 
a lottery ticket?   Today’s question: Do you have a tattoo? More Miley: It can stop, and it must stop
Nothing new can be said about Miley Cyrus’ racy 
VMA performance, and the world is sick of hearing about it anyway. All six and a half min-
utes of uncomfortable dancing have been broken down, mocked and raked for deeper meaning.
The issue Cyrus embodied as she sashayed around 
the stage in latex is this: Girls can’t discern what it means to grow up today.
Cyrus has been grooming herself to step away from 
the Hannah Montana image Disney carefully construct-ed during her early career. 
She took a ﬂ  ying leap away from that image with 
this performance, painting the transition to adulthood as one marked by inappropriate foam-ﬁ  nger thrusting.
While that might be true in some outstanding cases, 
young America has to know it’s not the norm. 
The problem with being an artist today is the auto-
matic position of power. 
Artists become role models by default, and while 
they can dance with molly and be ‘bout whatever life they choose, their actions have a signiﬁ  cant impact on young people watching with wide eyes.
We’ve all seen young girls dressed in too-small 
clothes, wearing more makeup than they could ever need. They learn their bodies are their most important tools. It’s media-induced behavior to be leaner, prettier and now sexier by age 20.
If young women can’t distinguish maturity from 
sexuality, we have a major problem on our hands. Both have their place, but they are not synonymous.
Growing up and becoming an adult shouldn’t en-
tail sexcapading across the stage in minimal clothing, bumping, grinding and motorboating every sentient creature along the way. Outrageous, overt sexuality is not interchangeable with maturity.
Across the concert hall at the VMAs sat Selena 
Gomez, whose ﬁ  lmed reaction has circulated the Inter-net and, not surprisingly, mir-rors that of the general public. 
Instead of dumping on Mi-
ley Cyrus, we should turn our attention to Selena Gomez — if only because she is Miley-Cyrus-gone-right.
Both raised on Disney’s air-
waves, both are known actress-
es and songstresses. The difference lies in presentation. 
Gomez’s single “Come and Get It” is undeniably sen-
sual, but at least it tries to be low-key. She wore plenty of clothing in the video, and the dancing isn’t all racy. She’s clearly not a little girl anymore, but she puts out the conﬁ  dent young adult vibe the world wants from Cyrus.
Perhaps a Disney starlet focus group would be ben-
eﬁ  cial, so delinquent peers could take notes from the valedictorians. 
After all, it was Gomez who left with a Moonman — 
and her dignity.
Miley Cyrus is — and we may need to see the paper-
work on this — an adult. Any girl navigating the years between child and adult needs a role model, but stars publicizing their own journey in terms of twerking and “ratchet” culture only serve to make it a hazier trip.
This is just one event, the culmination of a larger 
ideology being preached to young women. Growing up does not look like Amanda Bynes. It is not friends with Lindsay Lohan. It has nothing to do with Miley Cyrus.
On the backside of the VMAs, we know two things 
with clarity: The only blurred line that was executed successfully on that stage was the one between pornog-raphy and a duet, and Selena Gomez hired the better manager.

Proliﬁ  c Irish poet 
Seamus Heaney dies
Seamus Heaney’s ﬁ  nal words to his wife were “Don’t be 
afraid.”
This weekend, the world remembered the Irish No-
bel laureate following his death Friday. He was 74 years old. Heaney, widely regarded as the best Irish poet since W.B. Yeats, is known as the poet of soil and strife — his work illus-trated both the stark landscape of Northern Ireland and ongo-ing Irish troubles such as violent political struggles.
According to the Guardian, “Rock stars mixed with presi-
dents and prime ministers, politicians, poets and painters as about 1,000 people packed into the Heaney family’s parish church in the Donnybrook district of south Dublin.”
Monsignor Brendan Devlin delivered the homily at 
Heaney’s funeral Mass in Dublin yesterday. He called Heaney “the articulator of years of pain in the North.”
According to the Poetry Foundation’s Seamus Heaney page, 
“Heaney ‘makes you see, hear, smell, taste this life, which in his words is not provincial, but parochial; provincialism hints at the minor or the mediocre, but all parishes, rural or urban, are equal as communities of the human spirit,’ noted News-week correspondent Jack Kroll.”
In addition to earning critical success — he won the 1995 
Nobel Prize in literature — Heaney was a rarity: a best-selling poet. His books made up two-thirds of the sales of living poets in the U.K.
In Blake Morrison’s critical guide to Heaney’s poems, “Sea-
mus Heaney,” he notes that the author is “that rare thing, a poet rated highly by critics and academics yet popular with ‘the common reader.’”
In addition to bringing accessible poetry to the contempo-
rary literary world, his “plain-speaking” translation of the epic poem “Beowulf” won the Whitbread Book of the Year award and “laid the groundwork for a series of ﬁ  lm adaptations,” ac-cording to The Week UK.
“Prior to Heaney’s 1999 translation, the Anglo-Saxon epic 
poem was read mostly (and often reluctantly) by students of English Literature,” The Week UK stated.
Unfortunately, poetry is rarely in the news — or the gen-
eral consciousness, for that matter. Furthermore, it’s a shame that only important events, like deaths of major poets, bring people’s attention to poetry, since it’s an important art form of-ten forgotten beyond high school English classes. As Lawrence Ferlinghetti wrote in “Poetry as Insurgent Art,” “Poetry is a naked woman, a naked man, and the distance between them.”
Beyond that, poetry roots us in the past. It breathes life into 
history — and, as Percy Bysshe Shelley said, “Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world.”
We leave you now with the ﬁ  nal lines of one of Heaney’s 
best-known poems, “Digging”:
“The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap/ 
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge/ Through living roots awaken in my head/ But I’ve no spade to follow men like them/ Between my ﬁ  nger and my thumb/ The squat pen rests/ I’ll dig with it.”

The tragic events in Syria have dominated 
the news as of late. Thousands of people have died in this conﬂ  ict. The world is 
wondering whether the American government will intervene.
According to recent leaks, the United States 
government seems ready to launch three days’ worth of cruise missiles at Syria.
According to the Washington Post, “Presi-
dent Obama is weighing a military strike against Syria that would be of limited scope and duration, designed to serve as punishment for Syria’s use of chemi-cal weapons and as a deterrent, while keeping the United States out of deeper involvement in that country’s civil war, according to senior administration ofﬁ  cials.”
Before we start beating the drums of military interven-
tion, we have to address many unanswered questions.
What message is America sending to Syrian President 
Bashar al-Assad? A year ago, President Obama warned Syria’s use of chemical weapons against its own people would cross a “red line” that would trigger “enormous con-sequences.”
White House spokesman Jay Carney went on to say that 
Obama’s goal is not a Syrian regime change. Now — a year later — as chemical weapons are conﬁ  rmed to have been used, Obama retracted his idealism.
Who are our friends in Syria, and what threat does the na-tion pose to us? America has helped the rebels in Syria by giving them humanitarian aid and weapons. We do not know if we will get the weapons back or who will end up with them. With radical forces hostile to the United States ﬁ  ghting against Assad, should we elevate our enemies to power if we should take down As-sad? The country has not declared war on us and has not attacked us directly.
How much will intervention cost? Ameri-
ca’s economy is still in poor shape, and the government’s debt continues to rise. Many Americans do not think we should be spending money on a foreign nation while our infrastructure, schools and communities require help.
Why are nations surrounding Syria not intervening? One 
would think the countries surrounding an unstable nation with conﬁ  rmed chemical weapon attacks and an overﬂ  ow of refugees would be intervening in some way.
Turkey once encouraged direct action in Syria but has 
done no such thing. The oil-rich country of Jordan wants a diplomatic solution to the crisis instead of an attack. The countries seem to be waiting for America to do the dirty work.     
Despite the many unanswered questions this predica-
ment holds, we have many “known knowns.” If an Ameri-can service member is killed while carrying out the air strikes, the conversation will drastically change. The war-weary public will feel the old wounds of Iraq once again.
The second thing we know is the administration does 
not seem to have an overall plan of action. They were un-able to control foreign policy leaks, and they do not have a consistent message to give to Assad. An attack on Syria seems to leave America open for a retaliatory strike from ei-ther a Russian warship in the Mediterranean or from Syria’s ally Iran.
The administration lacks an exit strategy. Suppose 
Obama approves the airstrike and Assad is removed from power — what happens next? Will the country be engulfed in chaos? Will another civil war break out, or will Syria turn into Libya 2.0? Will America be forced to build a nation once again like it did in Iraq?
American foreign policy during the past decade has 
overestimated our strength and has intervened in the world too much. While America has the strongest military and economy in the world, we are not an invincible nation.
America was not founded 200 years ago to be the police 
force of the world. If there is no direct threat or gain to our country, we should not be involved. Giving humanitarian aid is one thing — launching cruise missiles is a completely different thing. In order to get our foreign policy back on track, we must render unto Syria what belongs to Syria and not intervene.

Unanswered questions loom over the big conﬂ  ict in SyriaColumnSPOILER ALERT: If you haven’t 
watched the show “Breaking Bad” and are interested in doing so, this 
probably isn’t the column for you.
As AMC’s hit television show “Break-
ing Bad” winds its way through its ﬁ  nal, tumultuous episodes, fans of the show are shocked at just how “bad” main character Walter White truly is.
Actor Bryan Cranston portrays a high-
school-teacher-turned-drug-kingpin as a ruthless crime lord, willing to lie, steal, kill and harm anyone who gets in the way of his methamphetamine empire. At this point in the show, it’s difﬁ  cult to recognize the seemingly harmless chemistry teacher from a few short seasons ago.
However, “Breaking Bad” is not simply 
about a middle-class husband, father and teacher who takes the low road to high proﬁ  ts. It’s about a man who saw no other choice after facing death.
The show begins with White, a humble 
chemistry teacher, learning he has lung cancer. White comes to the realization that with his meager salary and beneﬁ  ts as a public school teacher, he can’t cover the costs of necessary treatments and can’t pro-vide his family a nest egg if — and when — he succumbs to the disease.
Living in a hotbed of meth 
activity, White discovers by making high-quality meth, he can pay for his treatment and build that nest egg for his wife, son and unborn daughter — with maybe a little extra to spare.
If you cast aside the murder, 
mayhem, violence, drug use and tendency to sit on the edge of your seat during the show, “Breaking Bad” is actually a strik-ing critique on the cost of health care in the United States and the low pay of our public school teachers.
What if White made decent money or 
had good beneﬁ  ts as a public school teach-er? Isn’t it realistic that the show’s premise might not exist in a country that actually paid its teachers their full worth and had a health care system that didn’t regularly bankrupt families when somebody gets sick?
According to the National Education 
Association, over the ﬁ  rst decade of this century, teachers in Florida saw their sala-ries decrease by about 7 percent, the sixth-largest decrease in the country.  The aver-age starting salary for a public school teacher in Florida is $35,236, ranking 19th out of the 50 states. The average overall salary for a teacher in Florida is $45,732, leaving the state near the bottom.
According to the NEA, 
“Salaries are important for at-tracting, developing and keep-
ing a top-notch teaching force in place in each zip code, however over the years from 2001-02 through 2011-12, the buying power of teacher salaries has declined 2.8%.”
Just to put a teacher’s wages into per-
spective, in 2012, the average pay of a CEO for one of the top 350 companies in the United States was $14.1 million.
Once you consider the cost of treating 
cancer with chemotherapy, prescription medications, radiation and other forms of treatment, you could be facing a cost of several thousand dollars per month in or-der to beat the disease.
Can you really blame White for giv-
ing up on his teaching career for a life of crime?
People shouldn’t pursue a career of 
cooking meth in order to pay for their health care, and they shouldn’t even have to consider it. While the “Breaking Bad” ex-ample is far-fetched and highly unlikely, in reality, it raises serious questions about the growing disparities between the wealthy and the middle class — or what’s left of it.  
The Affordable Care Act tries mightily 
to end the madness of disease bankrupting families, but as with most major reforms, it faces major challenges. For the American economy to fully recover and for the mid-dle class of this nation to grow and thrive, we need to ensure that teachers — even ﬁ  c-tional ones like Walter White — don’t have to rely on illicit means to pay for health care.  
We are a better country than that, and 
those citizens making an honest living should not lose everything just because they get sick. 
Some may prefer a “you’re-on-your-
own” type of society, but that’s not right, and it’s certainly not American.
Finally, if you don’t watch “Breaking 
Bad,” you need to change this immedi-ately.

UF’s Phi Sigma Kappa chapter is under 
new rule in an effort to boost its numbers.
Jack Causseaux, associate director of soror-
ity and fraternity affairs, said although the Phi 
Sigma Kappa fraternity has had a charter at UF since 1951, membership for the fraternity has dipped troublingly low.
Decreasing numbers have caused the head-quarters in Indianapolis to send representa-tives to bolster the ranks.
“It isn’t unheard of for things like this to 
happen,” Causseaux said. “The fraternity has been here the whole time. They just haven’t had that many people recently.”
The Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity had leased 
a house sometime in the past five years, but after the lease ended, “its low numbers caused them to slip into obscurity,” he said.The fraternity’s national 
headquarters appointed UF sophomore Michael Lang as chapter president.
Lang, a 19-year-old ap-
plied kinesiology and phys-
iology major, said his term as chapter president began three weeks ago with six members. 
But he has already boosted enrollment to 
20 through unofficial recruitment. The frater-nity will also be participating in Rush Week. 
Lang said he was tired of how other fra-ternities are run, and the relatively large due payments bother him. His dues are $400 a se-mester, compared to the UF Inter-Fraternity Council’s average of $2,800.
Justin Shifrin, a 20-year-old accounting ju-
nior and public relations director for the IFC, said the chapter is trying to make more of a presence on campus.
“We’re happy that they’re trying to come 
on and make more of an identity for them-selves,” he said.
Although the fraternity doesn’t currently 
have a house, Lang is looking at properties close to campus to house his members.

In what activists character-
ize as an uphill battle to end 
mountaintop coal removal, lo-cal organization Gainesville Loves Mountains has planted its next flag.
Following months of negoti-
ations, the group will present a proposed ordinance to ban the use of mountaintop-removal coal to the City Commission on Sept. 12. The ordinance would prohibit Gainesville Regional Utilities from buying coal mined from mountaintops, which uses less manpower to harvest the resources.
Jason Fults, co-founder of 
Gainesville Loves Mountains, said because the commission acts as the board of directors for Gainesville Regional Utilities, its approval is crucial for ban-ning mountaintop removal.
The group has been circulat-
ing a petition that has collected about 1,200 signatures.
Gainesville Loves Moun-
tains has also set its sights on the energy provider contract for UF — an issue Kaydrianne Young, a volunteer for the group, said is related to mountaintop coal removal.
“There’s actually a connec-
tion between what we’re doing in the larger community and what we want to see at UF,” she said. “We have to realize how we’re connected to other people and things. We can’t stay in the UF bubble.”Young, a UF sociology se-
nior, said students need to understand what their tuition money is funding because UF’s energy contract is currently provided by Duke Energy —  the same company engaged in mountaintop coal removal.
Fults said that because UF’s 
long-standing contract with Duke Energy, previously Prog-ress Energy, soon expires, he is attempting to meet with UF’s Sustainability Committee to get the conversation about contract renewal brewing.  
“A lot of the UF community 
doesn’t know what they should know about Duke before they make a contract,” he said. “UF has ambitious sustainability goals, and they can’t meet those goals with Duke.”
Duke Energy is not the same 
as Progress Energy was, Fults said, and people should under-stand what they are agreeing to before they vote to renew the contract.
Commissioner Thomas 
Hawkins said he’s supportive of the ordinance, but it has a long way to go before it could pass.
“Mountaintop removal 
mining is very destructive to environment and to communi-ties to which it occurs,” he said. “If we can stop … we should do to our best to investigate it fully. There needs to be more conversations and details that need to be worked out that af-fect how we would implement a policy.”

More than 600 students can say 
goodbye to bland bedrooms.
The Reitz Union Rion Ball-
room was filled with the smell of 
popcorn, students chattering and music playing in the background as students decorated everything from mugs and cowboy hats to corkboards and mason jars at the second annual Bling Out Your Bedroom event Thursday.
But with double the amount of 
students expected to participate, the Reitz Union Board Entertain-ment-hosted event ran out of mate-rials half an hour before the event was supposed to end.
“This event definitely exceed-
ed our expectations,” said David O’Leary, a 21-year-old business administration senior and co-di-rector of RUB Entertainment. “We anticipated about 300 students and over 600 showed up.”
The organization used student 
fees to help fund the event. Bling Out Your Bedroom cost about $2,500, O’Leary said.
“Making a treasure chest is not as easy as I thought,” said Vin-nie Loos, an 18-year-old psychol-ogy freshman. “But having to go around asking people for supplies is a great way to meet people.”
Madison Pello, a 19-year-old 
health science sophomore and member of RUB Entertainment, said this event was especially pop-ular because the Inter-Residence Hall Association helped promote the event.
“RUB events are a great way 
for students to get active,” said O’Leary, “and every event RUB hosts is free for students.”

While booking Polite at the

He was arrested Saturday on

� EXPERIMENTS TESTED BALANCE 
AND DECISION-MAKING.

UF student Isabella Llano said that as 
a sister of Alpha Omicron Pi sorority, she 
wears high heels — a lot.
“I feel that wearing heels makes you 
more confident, which might help you make smarter decisions in general,” said the 19-year-old UF international studies sophomore.
A recent study by Brigham Young Uni-
versity suggests that wearing high heels can help people make smarter purchases. According to the study, having a height-ened sense of balance contributes to mak-ing financially sound decisions and pick-ing mid-range items instead of higher-end items.
As part of the study, co-authors Jeff Larson and Darron Billeter, both assistant professors of marketing at BYU, conduct-ed different experiments testing the corre-lation between balance and decision-mak-ing. One such experiment had consumers stand on one foot while considering a printer purchase.
Larson said he wanted to see how 
physical states affect decision-making.
“I chose balance because it’s the pri-
mary physical sensation. When you wear heels, you focus on being balanced physi-cally, which forces you to choose more balanced products as well,” Larson said.
Christina Hunt, a 19-year-old UF jour-
nalism sophomore and a Phi Mu sorority sister, doesn’t agree with the study. 
“Honestly, I think it sounds strange,” 
she said. “Perhaps, if you’re really good at walking in heels, but a lot of women have trouble walking in them and are more bal-anced in flats…. Maybe your feet hurt, so you’re in a rush to get home and don’t buy anything.”High heel wearers have step

A recent bill passed by the Arkansas Sen-
ate to limit body art procedures evoked fren-
zied online comments — many negative — but some of Gainesville’s own tattoo artists see the other side of the legislation.
Such procedures banned by the new bill 
include scarification, a branded tattoo with-out ink, and dermal implants, solid shapes placed underneath the skin, according to Ar-kansas Senate Bill 387.
Jack Salesses, a Gainesville tattoo artist at 
Valkyrie’s Tattoo & Body Piercing, located at 2226 NW Eighth Court, said he is in favor of the safety the regulation provides.
“Banning? No. Legislation? Yes,” Saless-
es said of the bill, now being passed to the House. “There should be very strict guide-lines and licensing requirements.”
Collin Jordan, a 26-year-old tattoo artist 
at Inked Tattoo, located at 1410 NW 13th St., said he thinks the bill is closed-minded.
“At a certain point, you stop judging, and 
if that person wants to express themselves that way, then, fine,” he said.
What both Salesses and Jordan are more 
concerned with are people called “scratch-ers.”
“Scratchers are people that don’t really 
know how to tattoo or draw. They just bought a machine, and they’re sitting at their house,” Jordan said.
In January 2012, Florida made regulations 
that require licensing with the Florida Depart-ment of Health, which includes a four-page checklist from the health department, licens-ing fees, continuing education and obtaining a biomedical waste permit. Prior to that, only body piercing required a license.
“The biggest concern to me is that [scratch-
ers] are destroying people’s skin,” Jordan said.
Because tattooing in Florida is highly 
regulated, Salesses said he wishes state gov-ernment enforced heavier penalties for those who tattoo without a license. The current ad-ministrative action is a fine.
“Get the right people in [the board], the 
right education and the right legislation, and put some bite behind it,” Salesses said. Arkansas body art bill leaves

The Florida volleyball team 
began its season with three consectuive wins during the weekend. Read the story on page 15.  PHIL HEILMAN

  Gideon Ajagbe did not play a snap for the 
Gators in 2012.
  But after switching from linebacker to 
fullback during the offseason, Ajagbe has seen his role increase rapidly. He started on No. 9 Florida’s ﬁ  rst offensive series and scored the ﬁ  rst touchdown of his career in a 24-6 victory against Toledo on Saturday in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. 
  “I haven’t played much these past three 
years,” Ajagbe said Saturday. “For me to be a starter today, all credit goes to [God].”
  With Florida leading 17-6 late in the third 
quarter, quarterback Jeff Driskel threw a pass to Ajagbe in the ﬂ  at. After ﬁ  ghting off a tackler, he pushed forward for 12 yards and a ﬁ  rst down. Three plays later, Driskel again found Ajagbe open, and the junior plunged into the end zone to increase UF’s lead to 24-6.
  Ajagbe ﬁ  nished the game with two catch-
es for 16 yards and a touchdown. He also helped pave the way for running back Mack Brown, who ﬁ  nished with a career-high 112 yards and two touchdowns on 25 carries. 
  “He’s done an outstanding job block-
ing, protecting (and) catching the football,” Muschamp said of Ajagbe. “He’s a guy that has really blossomed in the position. That’s why you’ve always got to try and cross-train guys at different spots and see what they can do.” 
  For Ajagbe, who is known by teammates 
as the “Nigerian Nightmare,” changing po-sitions seemed like an obvious choice. After suffering a torn rotator cuff as a freshman in 2010, an injury that forced him to redshirt, he returned and played four games on spe-cial teams in 2011 before not seeing the ﬁ  eld in 2012.
  Muschamp encouraged him to work at 
fullback during the summer, a change that has paid dividends so far as Hunter Joyer, UF’s starting fullback, works to get fully healthy following a hamstring injury.   “I’m just happy that I could contribute,” 
Ajagbe said. “Whatever it is, if I start again next week or if Hunter starts, I’ll play hard, and I’ll play my role. That’s what matters.”
  Added Muschamp: “He’s been a huge 
addition for us. The thing about Gideon is he’s got length. He can play the fullback po-sition. He can also be a move tight end for us, which he didn’t play as much Saturday because of Hunter’s situation.
  Updated depth chart: Florida released 
its two-deep depth chart for Miami on Mon-day.   Matt Jones is now listed as UF’s No. 1 
running back; Antonio Morrison is listed behind Mike Taylor at the Mike linebacker spot. 
  Jones missed Florida’s 24-6 season-open-
ing victory against Toledo while recovering from a viral infection he suffered in July. The sophomore running back participated in warm-ups with the team and is expected to start against Miami. 
  “(I) feel pretty good about his progress,” 
Muschamp said. “As we work through the week, we’ll be able to know how much he will be able to contribute, but he certainly will play.”
  Morrison sat out Saturday due to a one-
game suspension levied by Muschamp fol-lowing the sophomore linebacker’s pair of offseason arrests. 
  “He brings certain physicality to our foot-
ball team, and he’s a very good communica-tor at the linebacker position,” Muschamp said, “which for us is critical because you gotta have a guy that is going to be able to relay the calls.”
  Sophomore receiver Latroy Pittman, who 
was suspended Saturday and will be forced to sit out two more games, is no longer listed on the depth chart.
  Getting healthy: Florida escaped the ﬁ  rst 
weekend of the season relatively unscathed. Linebacker Darrin Kitchens (pulled oblique), left tackle D.J. Humphries (sprained MCL) and defensive tackle Dominique Easley (ﬂ  u) were the only players Muschamp mentioned during a run-down of injuries Monday. 
  Kitchens will miss a couple of days but 
is expected to play Saturday. Easley and Humphries are expected to return to prac-tice Tuesday. 
  “We feel pretty good about where we 
are,” Muschamp said. 
  Gators cut: With NFL teams having to 
reduce rosters to 53 players on Saturday, several former Gators became jobless over the weekend. 
  The New England Patriots cut Tim Tebow 
and former UF defensive end Jermaine Cun-ningham. Joining the list was David Nelson (Cleveland Browns), Frankie Hammond Jr. (Kansas City Chiefs), Chas Henry (Tampa Bay Buccaneers) and Lerentee McCray (Den-ver Broncos).

“He’s a guy that has really 
blossomed in the position. That’s 
why you’ve always got to try and 
cross-train guys at different spots 
and see what they can do.”

 Shooting stars are rare, and 
people love that.
  Advancements in tele-
scopes and technology have al-lowed humanity to see so much more from space, but catching a glimpse of a shooting star has an exciting, nostalgic edge.
  I liken that quality to this 
weekend’s game between the Gators and the Hurricanes.
  The Florida-Miami rivalry 
delivered can’t-miss games for nearly half a cen-tury until the series ended its annual run in 1987. Now, if you blink, you’ll miss the showdown.
  Growing up 
a Gators fan in Gainesville, Florida coach Will Muschamp always had a vested interest any time the Gators faced off against the Hurricanes. No matter where the game was played, he was hooked.
  “When it was in Mi-
ami, I remember watch-ing or listening on the radio,” Muschamp said. “Then, obviously, when it was here in Gainesville, I was trying 
to get in the stadium somehow.”
  The same cannot be said for 
Gators quarterback Jeff Driskel, who hails from Oviedo, which is just outside of Orlando — nestled between the two schools.
  “I saw Ahmad Black tweet the 
other day one of the scores to a game that we won,” Driskel said. “That’s about all I know of the history of Florida-Miami.”
  And at the rate the series is 
going now with no matchups planned beyond Saturday’s game, Driskel’s successors at Florida will not know much about this rivalry.  It’s sad to see a series that in-
cludes moments like the “Florida Flop,” needless game-ending ﬁ  eld goals from Howard Schnellen-berger in 1980 and Urban Meyer in 2008 and ex-Gator Brock Ber-lin leading Miami to a 23-point comeback in 2003 sit dormant.
  In a perfect world free of logic 
and red tape, the Hurricanes and Gators would meet annually in a highly anticipated matchup of re-
UF-UM rivalry fun to watch but not viable annually Matt Riva / Alligator Staff

surgent powers.
  But on Florida’s end, playing Miami 
regularly makes little sense for several 
reasons.
  The most well-documented issue 
is money. In order to fund all Gators sports, athletics director Jeremy Foley has said UF needs to play seven home football games per season.
  In an interview with The Alligator 
last November, Foley said that Florida has been setting aside money since 2008 to account for playing only six home games this season.
  Foley told Mark Long of the As-
sociated Press on Monday that the two teams could potentially continue to play at a neutral site. Orlando and Tampa seem like good options.
  But even if Florida found a way to 
make an annual series with Miami ﬁ  -nancially viable, adding another regu-lar opponent with top-25 potential is just ludicrous.
  Sure, we’d all love to see it, but con-
sider what the Gators have to deal with already from year to year. Georgia, South Carolina, Florida State and LSU aren’t going anywhere.
  Also, you have to think that the 
sleeping giant at Tennessee is eventu-ally going to wake up. And with po-tential games against Alabama a pos-sibility, I doubt any Gator fans want to battle for Sunshine State supremacy during UF’s weeks away from the Southeastern Conference grind.
  The UF-UM rivalry has a rich his-
tory, but it is a relic in college football’s current climate. 
Even more storied non-conference 
rivalries like Texas-Texas A&M and Notre Dame-Michigan simply cannot survive without some ﬁ  nancial or com-petitive sacriﬁ  ce.
  With the jockeying for playoff spots 
that will begin next season, the margin of error for each is incredibly thin. Flor-ida playing and beating Miami looks good on a postseason resume, but can the Gators count on taking down the Hurricanes every year?
  Florida-Miami is a good rivalry 
that’s fun to watch, but the schools have a good thing going. I imagine they will continue playing each other intermittently, and whenever they do face off, I’m writing about it, and you’re reading. JOE , from page 13

Will Muschamp reacts to a call during Florida’s 24-6 victory against Toledo on Saturday 
in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. The Gators were ﬂ  agged 10 times for 70 yards in their season opener after averaging 8.1 penalties for 68.9 yards per game during the 2012 season.

      Despite the Gators’ perfect 3-0 
record to begin the season, coach Mary Wise said the team still has a laundry list of imperfections that must be corrected before the Big Four Classic starts Saturday.
The season began without a 
hitch as No. 8 Florida breezed past New Orleans by hitting an even .500 through three sets while hold-ing the Privateers to a -.018 clip, which was the lowest percentage by a UF opponent since Mississippi State hit -.141 on Oct. 26.
However, once Florida faced off 
against LIU-Brooklyn, a team that rode a 19-game winning streak into the NCAA Tournament last year, the Gators returned to earth.
In four sets of work, Wise’s 
squad committed 12 service errors and 18 attack errors that helped the Blackbirds avoid the sweep and take the third set from the Gators.
“They played inspired (and) 
we got a little tentative,” Wise said Friday following the match. “Now that we’ve won, we can say it was good for us.”
Noami Santos-Lamb said the 
team still has to build a rhythm that only experience can bring. 
“We have newcomers in, we 
have people who are getting used to being back and getting in pace,” the sophomore outside hitter said. “So it’s more about getting to a pace than improving in any set skill.”
Florida’s final opportunity to 
work on its chemistry on the court before heading off to Texas on Wednesday was the Campus USA Invitational finale against Duke on Saturday.
Madison Monserez thought the 
match against the Blue Devils was important for the team to prove that it can recover after struggling the night before.
The junior defensive special-
ist said the Gators’ defense, which gave up 14 kills to the Blackbirds in the third set Friday, was a prime example of how much a team can grow within 24 hours of a tough match.
“The first two games, I think we 
were trying to find our rhythm with digging the deeper balls,” she said. “And then when we addressed it, we made an adjustment. We’re not always going to play the same types of teams. This was a great lesson in regards to adapting and learning how to adjust our game.”
The benefit of facing NCAA- 
Tournament caliber teams early in the season is that it provides Florida with reference material as it prepares for the likes of No. 2 Penn State and No. 3 Stanford, Wise said.
Last year after sweeping three 
non-tournament squads in the Campus USA Invitational, UF dropped both its matches in the Big Four Classic the following week.
“Often times you learn more 
when your team struggles,” Wise said.TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

After winning last year’s Southeastern Confer-
ence title, Florida’s women have not wavered.
In their 2013 season debut, the Gators swept the 
top five spots in a field of 104 racers on Friday at the 
Western Carolina Invitational in Cullowhee, N.C. 
Seniors Agata Strausa and Shelby Hayes fin-
ished first and second with times of 10:52.29 and 10:56.82, respectively. The win in Cullowhee is Strausa’s second in her career — her last victory came in Gainesville at the 2012 Mountain Dew In-vitational. 
Sophomore Julie Macedo, freshman Taylor 
Tubbs and senior Stephanie Strasser rounded out the top five of the women’s two mile run.
Macedo, Hayes and Strasser all bested their 
marks from last year’s Western Carolina Invita-tional. All five women finished within 20 seconds of each other on Friday.  
“I thought the women came out and did a great 
job tonight, especially working together as a team throughout the duration of the race,” coach Paul Spangler said Friday. “Agata, Shelby, Julie, Taylor and Steph all finished as a pack claiming the top five spots.”
Florida’s men also won their 5K run thanks to 
senior Mark Parrish’s ninth career Gators victory, posting a time of 14:50.06. 
Florida had four men finish in the top six. Junior 
Jimmy Clark came in third with a time of 15:04.22, junior Eddie Garcia placed fourth with a time of 15:14.67 and junior J.L. Hines came in sixth with a time of 15:23.11. 
“Mark Parrish looked very impressive,” Span-
gler said. “I was also impressed with Eddie Garcia. We had a very solid effort on the men’s side, plac-ing our first four scorers in the top six in the field.
“Both teams came out tonight 
and really did a good job. With the Western Carolina being our first meet of the season, we’ll need to continue to build on this and keep working hard. We have 
a lot of important racing on the horizon and we’ll continue to improve as the season progresses.”
This year marks the third consecutive season 
Florida opened the season at Western Carolina. It is also the third straight year that both the men’s and women’s teams began the season by earning victories.
With a week to train, the Gators are set to com-
pete in front of their home crowd on Sept. 14 at Mark Bostick Golf Course for the 2013 Mountain Dew Invitational. Compeition begins at 7:55 a.m. 
“This race was a great gauge for where we are at 
to begin the season,” Spangler said. 
“Now we have two weeks before our next race 
to train. We’re looking forward to being on our home course in front of all our Gator fans for the first of two home races this season, the second be-ing SECs in November.”UF sweeps season-opening meet

Florida and Florida Interna-
tional saw yellow Sunday night.
Down by several goals on their 
home field, the Panthers came out 
fighting in the second half of their 4-0 loss to the No. 8 Gators.
Despite FIU’s rough play, UF 
never relented as each side col-lected fouls and yellow cards. 
The two teams combined for 31 
fouls — including seven yellow cards.
The Gators collected three yel-
low cards — one each on center back Christen Westphal, defender Haley Reeb and goalkeeper Taylor Burke.
The yellows given out to Flor-
ida sparked a fire in coach Becky Burleigh, who is generally regard-ed as having a calm demeanor. Despite the unruly nature of the game, she took pride in the fact that her team did not falter against the Panthers’ physicality.
“Late in the game, when it got 
a little chippy, I liked the presence our team brought,” Burleigh said. “They weren’t going to back down from anything. The game dictated that we step up and be a little physical and we did just that.”
The two teams’ seventh meet-
ing proved to be the most physi-cal.
The last time the in-state rivals 
met was during the 2012 regular season, when one yellow card was issued to FIU’s Nikki Rios. 
The Gators re-
corded five fouls on the night — 13 fewer than Sunday’s total. This year’s meet-ing was the only time Florida col-lected more fouls than FIU.
Despite the hostility in the 
game, Florida’s win improved the Gators to 7-0  in its all-time series against the Panthers. 
Freshman Pamela Begic, who 
scored one of Florida’s four goals and recorded an assist, said de-spite the animosity against them, the Gators stuck together to pull out the win.
“We were talking about im-
proving our execution and we really put our minds toward that goal,” Begic said. 
“I think we succeeded as a 
team.”Fouls frustrate Gators

fewer than 200 yards on Saturday, he completed a pass to eight dif-ferent receivers during the game. Senior Trey Burton led the receiv-ing corps with ﬁ  ve catches for 69 yards, including Florida’s longest reception — a 26-yard completion over the middle. 
“I think we did some nice 
things in the throwing game, es-pecially with some new faces,” Muschamp said.
But when the offense stalled 
at the start of the third quarter, it was a defensive newcomer who gave Florida the momentum it left in the locker room.
Cornerback Vernon Har-
greaves III, playing in his ﬁ  rst col-lege game, snagged a pass in front of Toledo wide receiver Alonzo Russell. Hargreaves returned the interception — Florida’s lone takeaway — for 15 yards, putting the Gators in the red zone with 3:34 left in the quarter.
“He got his hands on some 
balls in camp,” cornerback Jaylen Watkins said, “so I wasn’t sur-prised.”
Following the interception, Driskel connected with Ajagbe to put Florida ahead by 17.
Although Florida forced only 
one turnover, the defense had a game that lived up to last year’s top-5 ranking in 2012.
Juniors Ronald Powell, mak-
ing his ﬁ  rst start since suffering an ACL tear in 2012, and Leon Orr both recorded sacks, while ﬁ  ve different players made tack-les behind the line.
Senior Dominique Easley led 
the pass rush, forcing three hur-ried passes from Rockets quarter-back Terrance Owens.
“That’s what Florida is about,” 
Easley said. “Speed and power. Speed and 
explosiveness.”
Owens never got comfortable 
in the pocket, completing only 45 percent of his passes as the Gators hurried him eight times and sacked him twice. The Rock-ets only managed 205 yards of to-tal offense.
Florida kept Toledo’s offense 
off balance throughout the game When the Rockets did get into the red zone, the Gators defense stepped up to meet the challenge, forcing Toledo to settle for a ﬁ  eld goal.
“You always want to come out 
with a shutout,” Easley said.
