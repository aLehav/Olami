Medical professor
passes away at 81
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
Willie Joe Sanders had five chil-
dren of his own to care for, but he
also acted as a father figure for
countless UF medical students.
Sanders, 81, one of UF's first
black students and the first black
faculty member at the UF College of
Medicine, died Saturday after losing
a battle with cancer.
Many people described Sanders
as an "institution within an institu-
tion" because of the legacy he left.
Before coming to UF, he attended
the Hampton Institute, now Hamp-
ton University, a historically black
university in Virginia.
He served in the Navy and the
Army. After returning from Korea
in 1957, he got a job as a lab techni-
cian at UF's Health Science Center.
Sanders applied to UF in 1959 -
before integration -and was told
he'd need a court order to be ac-
cepted.
As a technician, he studied onhis own time, and in 1962, when the
school finally integrated, he was ac-
cepted as one of UF's first six black
undergraduates and studied math-
ematics. He graduated in 1970.
In 1968, he became the first black
faculty member at the UF College
of Medicine. He taught anatomy to
first-year medical and dental stu-
dents.
His daughter Paula Pringle said
Sanders was an important role mod-
el for the few black-
enrolled at the Col-
-1 lege of Medicine.
He helped them
with schoolwork
and also helped
them adjust to life
dr ^ at a predominantly
white school.
He retired from UF in 1989, but
soon grew bored without a job.
"My father wasn't a man to sit
still and let moss grow on his seat,"
Pringle said.
Sanders started teaching again at
Florida A&M University's School of

Ladies nights may end
0 IT CAN BE A VIOLATION OF THE
CITYS DISCRIMINATION LAW.
By TYLER JETT
and MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writers
Kelli Stoops does not take Wednes-
day nights off.
Wednesday is ladies night, and
Stoops, a waitress and bartender at
Copper Monkey, knows she will bring
home more cash.
"That's my main money maker,"
Stoops said.But soon, Wednesday may be less lu-
crative for Stoops. This week, local bar
and restaurant owners received a letter
from Gainesville Equal Opportunity Di-
rector Cecil Howard telling them that
offering ladies night specials may get
them into trouble.
Any gender-based deals can be con-
sidered a violation of the city's discrimi-
nation law and subject to lawsuits, ac-
cording to the letter.
"If [a business] says we will give one
gender a discount not another, it's the
same as giving one race a discount and
not another," Howard said in a phone

Grooveshark faces suit
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Grooveshark may not care too much
for money, but it could be forced to pay
for oldies.
The Gainesville-based company,
which allows users to stream and up-
load music free of charge, is being sued
by Universal Music Group for illegally
reproducing and distributing copies of
songs from Universal's pre-1972 catalog.
The songs are copyright-protected
under New York state law and include
hits from popular musicians such as The
Jackson 5, Buddy Holly, The Who and
Marvin Gaye, all of whom are listed in
the lawsuit.
Universal filed the suit in January in a
New York state court for an undisclosed
amount of money, which will be deter-mined in a trial.
According to the 11-page suit posted
on Digitalmusicnews.com, Groove-
shark's business plan "is based on copy-
right infringement," and Grooveshark
has caused Universal Music Group "ir-
reparable injury that cannot be fully
compensated or measured in money

ENVIRONMENT
Weather helps butterflies
By LAUREN LEGE
Alligator Contributing Writer
The turn of seasons is allowing the Miami
blue butterfly population to thrive at UF.
Waves of warm weather, critical to the spe-
cies' survival, may assist UF efforts to restore
the endangered butterflies, according to Jaret
Daniels, Miami blue project director at the
Florida Museum of Natural History.
"Our plant nursery and captive popula-
tions was impacted by the winter season,"
Daniels said. "It will simply mean a slower-
than-normal ramp up to high captive num-
bers this year."
UF scientists had difficulty this winter
maintaining a warm-climate flower the but-
terflies feed on. Nicer weather is expected
to yield better results in the plant turnout,
which would ensure a native source of nec-
tar for the Miami blue butterflies, said Jeffrey
Hansen, vivarium assistant manager at the
museum.
The Miami blue, a small species with lumi-
nous blue wings, is native to Florida, with the
largest population inhabiting South Florida's
coastal regions, hence the species' name.
"It is also a highly visible endangered spe-
cies, making it ideal for public education and
nature viewing," Daniels said.
After Hurricane Andrew nearly wiped
out the Miami blue population in 1992, con-
servationists believed the species was extinct.It wasn't until 1999 that a colony of 50 Miami
blue butterflies was rediscovered in Bahia
Honda State Park.
Since rediscovery, conservation efforts
have gone into effect to restore the fragile
population, with UF leading the way with its
monitoring and captive propagation program
for the species, according to the Florida Fish
and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
"Our plant nursery and captive
populations was impacted by the
winter season."
Jaret Daniels
Miami blue project director at the Florida
Museum of Natural History
"Dr. Jaret Daniels has been the champion
for this little known, almost invisible butter-
fly," said Michael Boulware, a natural history
exhibit staff member. "He has taken a popu-
lation of under 50, bred over 30,000, and re-
placed more than 7,000 in the field."
These efforts ensure the butterflies' entire
adult lives can be spent in the area they are
trying to re-establish as habitat, which will
preserve the species for future generations,
Boulware said.
"The Miami blue is a Florida endemic,
meaning it does not occur elsewhere," Dan-
iels said. "If it is lost from Florida, it is lost
forever."Entrepreneurs to speak
0 THE FORUM WILL FEATURE
UF-TIED BUSINESSES.
By ROBERT IMFELD
Alligator Contributing Writer
The founders of Grooveshark and
other successful entrepreneurs who
have ties to UTF will participate in a fo-
rum today to discuss how they opened
their businesses.
The Student Entrepreneurs Forum,
which will be held in Bryan Hall 232
from 5:30 p.m. To 7:30 p.m., comes at
a time when, according to the Depart-
ment of Labor, the national unemploy-
ment rate is creeping up to nearly 10
percent.
Kyle Futch, project captain, said he
is excited for Grooveshark's founders
to participate because the online music
service is such a hit with UF students.
Josh Greenberg, co-founder of
Grooveshark and vice president of
products, said he hopes to help young
entrepreneurs by sharing some of the
experiences he's had while financing
and managing his company during the
last four years.
"The time I spent at UF showed me
how much talent there is in Gainesville,
and gave me inspiration for being ableto operate a tech company outside of
the traditionally tech-centric regions of
the country," Greenberg said.
Greenberg thinks even in such a
rough economy, younger people are
more inclined to take leaps of faith to
pursue their dreams.
Futch said he hopes the looming
knowledge of near-double-digit un-
employment rates will attract more
students to the event as he added the
theme for this year's program is UF
students' success in opening their own
businesses.
Each of the five speakers at today's
moderated panel either

The other businesses
represented are Fracture, a company
that prints images onto glass; Student
Maid, a cleaning service; and Kids for

SG creates Reitz liaison position
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Student Senators continued
conversation about the Reitz
Union repairs at Tuesday night's
Senate meeting.
Senators unanimously passed
a bill creating a liaison position
between the Student Senate and
the Reitz Union Board of Manag-
ers.
The liaison will attend the
Board of Managers' meetings and
report back to the Senate upon re-
quest.
Senate President Kara Olesky
said she has been hoping to create
a position like this for a while.
"I feel that we should be hav-
ing stronger communication, es-
pecially because we do give them
a budget and we do give them
funding," Olesky said.
Last week, senators rejected a
bill presented by the Student Al-
liance party which would have
created a Reitz Union oversight
committee.
The committee would have
worked with the Board of Man-
agers to determine which Reitz
Union repairs are necessary and
why money was not set aside
when the union was built to make
the repairs.Jonathan Ossip, Student Al-
liance party Senate leader, said
having a single liaison is bet-
ter than having nothing, and his
party will be working on a com-
prehensive reform package for
the Reitz Union to present to the
Senate in the fall.
Ossip said the Senate needs
to be looking into how the Reitz
Union is governed and how its
budget is used.
"I feel that we should be
having stronger communi-
cation, especially because
we do give them a budget,
and we do give them fund-
ing."
Kara Olesky
Senate president
"It doesn't take a Ph.D. or an
engineering degree to know that
you need to maintain money to
keep your building going," Ossip
said. "I really hope that in light of
the huge problem facing the Reitz
Union that this position does ac-
tually do something."
Unite Party Sen. Ben Mey-
ers said a Reitz Union oversight
committee would have been re-
dundant.
"But it's definitely good toIt was a unanimous votehave a liaison between us and
the Board of Managers," Meyers
said.
Senators also heard a presen-
tation about the pros and cons of
making health insurance manda-
tory for all UF students.
During the presentation, Bran-
don Sack, the health insurance
executive director for SG, said
about 20 percent of students do
not have health insurance, while
80 percent have their own plan or
are covered under their parents'
health insurance policy.
He said buying the school-
sponsored health insurance man-
datory would create a 7 percent
increase in the cost of atten-
dance.
But students would still be
free to purchase their own poli-
cies, Sack said.
Any student is free to go out
on their own to the individual
insurance market and buy their
own, which meets certain mini-
mum standards.
Senators also unanimously
passed an amendment to the
budget transferring about $14,000
from the Accent and SG Produc-
tions co-sponsorhsip budget to
the SGP general budget.
TJ Villamil chairman of the
Budget and Appropriations
Committee said the amendment
will help put money back into the
hands of students.

'Twilight' novella announced
By EMILY MORROW
Alligator Contributing Writer
"Twilight" fans thirsty for more vam-
pire stories have a reason to celebrate.
Stephenie Meyer, the 36-year-old au-
thor of the "Twilight" series, announced
in a press release Tuesday that a 192-page
novella titled "The Short Second Life of
Bree Tanner" will hit bookstores on June
5 and will cost about $14. The short story
will be available for free online from June
7 to July 5.
Bree Tanner is a newborn vampire
who was introduced briefly in "Eclipse,"
the third book in the "Twilight" series. The
story will feature her perspective traveling
with a vampire army through Seattle.
The book will be released 25 days
before the movie "The Twilight Saga:
Eclipse" hits theaters.
UF sophomore Ashley Reinheimerthinks releasing the book just before the
movie is a good idea.
"r think it will help generate even more
traffic for the movie," she said.
Book sales will also benefit the Ameri-
can Red Cross International Response
Fund, which aids in disaster relief efforts.
According to the press
release, $1 from each
sale will go to the fund,
and the online version
of the book will include
a link for donations.
Pam Jones, general
manager of the New-
berry Road BordersMeyer Bookstore, said the hu-
manitarian aspect of Meyer's book is rela-
tively new to the publishing world.
But she thinks Meyer's name, rather
than the prospect of donating, will play a
bigger role in boosting sales.Harlem students tour campus
-THEIR TEACHER HOPES TO
URGE THEM TO GO TO COLLEGE.
By STEFANIA FERRO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Keith Robinson made a promise to his 90
math students within the orange-and-blue
-papered walls of his Harlem, N.Y., class-
room.
If they excelled in their classes, they
could visit UF, where Tim Tebow made the
"promise speech" that has served as a moti-
vational force in their classroom.
Twenty seventh-grade students from In-
termediate School 195 visited UF Tuesday
after Robinson, 26, their math teacher and
a UF alumnus, raised more than $8,000 for
the trip through an online donation site.
Their visit will include a tour of campus,
a trip to the UF Digital Worlds Institute and
a trip to a local horse farm.
Some of the students like A'nisa Meg-
ginson, 12, said they hoped to meet Tim
Tebow. Megginson said Tebow talked to
them on the phone.The purpose of the trip is to encourage
students to pursue college, he said.
Robinson had no doubt he was going
to college, but that's not the case for these
middle schoolers.
"It's not a given," Robinson said. "And
for a lot of them, it's not an option."
Taking Tebow's lead, the students have
signed their own promises to work hard in
their classes.
In a video Robinson made and posted
online, his students touch a picture of Tim
Tebow and a laminated sign of Tebow's
promise.
On The video helped make the
Campus trip to UF possible by spread-
ing the word about Robin-
son's goal to visit UF with the students.
Robinson raised the money by setting
up an account on Donorschoose.org, an on-
line charity, in January and needed to raise
almost $7,000 for 24 round-trip plane tickets
to Gainesville, according to the Web site's
records.
Fifty-seven donors in a little less than a
month donated $8,480.54 for the project and

PUBLIC HEALTH
Students react to
health bill provision
By ANNIE BOGGS
Alligator Contributing Writer
In six months, second-year UF
law student John Hunt will have
one extra year of free health care.
After the U.S. House of Represen-
tatives passed historic health reform
March 21, Hunt, like many fellow
students, will be able to remain on
his parent's health insurance plan
until he is 26 years old, an increase
from the current 22.
"I think it's a great idea," Hunt
said of the new bill.
Robert French, a 26-year-old UF
political science major, is covered
by UF's health insurance plan but,
like Hunt, spoke positively about
the rewards younger students will
reap with Congress' approval of the
health care bill.
"I think that you should be able
to have health care on your parents
until you're financially secure by"I think that you should be

yourself," French said.
Taking effect in about six months,
this change will be one of the first
elements of the bill people will be
able to see. The changes to allow de-
pendent children to remain on their
parents' plans for an additional four
years comes at a time when the slow
job market hinders many college
students and graduates from being
insured by employment.
In February 2010, the unemploy-
ment rate for college graduates 25 or
older was 5 percent, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

If you could ask Secretary of Education Arne Duncan any-
thing you wanted, what would it be? Would it be about
the value of your degree when you graduate?
What about how Obama and his administration plan to pro-

Or would it be about the frustrations of trying to find and

Well, you may just get a chance to have that question an-
swered.

All Fired Up
e're always sur-prised at the new
levels of hypocrisy
some people reach, and the
recently proposed Florida
House of Representatives
Bill 315 is no exception.
Adoption agencies in the
past have been able to ask
potential parents if they have
a firearm in their houses. Bill
315, sponsored by Osceola Re-
publican Rep. Mike Homer,
would keep these agencies
from asking this question.
We can't see how this is in
any way infringing on some-
one's rights. Answering "yes"
to the question would not
cause the adoption agencies to
deny a child to potential par-
ents; state officials say there's
no record of someone being
denied adoption because of
owning a gun. The question
is asked because the agencies
want to give safety tips to par-
ents, especially first-timers,so that they may raise their
children without any danger.
The agencies aren't asking
people to get rid of their guns
before they adopt or refusing
them anything that families
without guns would be get-
ting. It's just another question
about the safety of a potential
new home.
But this one just might in-
fringe on the rights of barren
National Rifle Association
members, so it has to go.
There haven't been many
challenges to this new bill; ev-
eryone seems perfectly happy
with it. And, yet, this sudden
outrage at lives being pried
into does not extend to the
question that continues to re-
main on these adoption forms:
whether a potential adopter is
religious. Apparently, people
shouldn't have to say whether
they own guns, but worship-
ping something is important.
And we won't even get
started on gay adoption.

Current wars challenge ou
o matter your politics, as a citizen of the world and aproduct of history, you must recognize that the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan are pivotal moments in our
age that will have repercussions for decades to come.
Although my knowledge of the situation on the ground
in these countries is patched together through futuristic mili-
tary recruitment commercials and "The Hurt Locker," it is
clear that both wars will not only continue to have an effect
on the current generation in power but will also color all as-
pects of life for our generation as we move forward and take
the reins of society.
By our generation, I mean those people from roughly their
late teens to their early 30s, the generation that has embraced
technology, grown more connected to society because of it
and eventually has evolved into a people constantly striv-
ing for something new, different and bizarre (the so-called
"Lady Gaga principle").
However, beyond today's popular culture and the events
that currently shape our daily lives, I see a growing discon-
nect that stems from the continuation and expansion of these
two wars. With the wars continuing unabated and tensions
mounting over the futures of both conflicts, I feel that the
most pressing issue facing us is a social chasm between the
young soldiers who are being sent to war and those of us of
the same generation who are here at home.
Looking at statistics, the average age of an active duty sol-
dier is 28, and almost half of all soldiers are between the ages
of 22 and 30.
When looking at news reports coming out of these coun-
tries, I often see that I am the same age as many of these sol-
diers fighting and dying abroad.
Although support of the troops is a strong American
tradition, I can't help but feel that our generation will grow
and split into those who have been touched by the wars and
those who have not truly felt its sorrow.
In the past, countless generations of Americans have suf-
fered through war and have successfully reconciled its painJoshua Lee
letters@alligator orgr generation
with the comforts of peace.
However, two current factors have
the potential to combine and deepen
the rift between those in our genera-
tion.
First, the explosion of social media
and the online community has al-
lowed people to escape not only the
turbulence of their daily lives but the
struggles of greater society, including
these two conflicts.
While this technological revolution has bred a greater
power to connect and share ideas, too often this power is di-
verted and used for socially irresponsible reasons.
Second, given the nature of these conflicts and how they
have been branded by those who lead them, the gravity of
our situation is often lost on many in the greater society.
Although these facts have been repeated so often they
are on the verge of becoming hollow points, we are occupy-
ing two different countries and fighting a war that grows
increasingly unconventional and infinitely more dangerous
by the day.
Yet looking at the climate here at home, these facts are not
properly reflected and seem to be lost among many in our
generation.
They say that you can never understand war or see it
properly until you are in it. This idea, augmented by the fac-
tors mentioned above, is the source for what I perceive as a
dangerous disconnect in our generation.
But what can we do to close the gap? Turn all farms on
Farmville into virtual war gardens? Mandate daily tweets to
service members deployed overseas?
Perhaps the only thing we can do is recognize that we are
at war and work to anticipate the challenges we will face as a
generation going forward.

Letters to the Editor
Idol Hands editorial insulting
It has been said that "anti-Catholicism is
the anti-Semitism of the Left." The Monday
editorial "Idol Hands" is vivid proof this
is true.
Disappointing enough was the Alliga-
tor's jumping on the bandwagon of the in-
ternational media, which has been itching to
jump on the abominable scandal in Ireland
and dig up the slightest shred of evidence
by which to condemn the Holy Father -
of which they will find none. But the Al-
ligator clearly has not done much research.
Worse still, the Alligator editorial staff
showed its true colors with this repulsive
and absolutely insulting editorial.
The writer was undoubtedly unable to
contain his zeal to smear and spew his con-
tempt for the Catholic Church. The writer
attacked the often misunderstood, yet
valid, doctrine on indulgences, completely
disregarded the immense and beneficial
work the church has performed throughout
its history on behalf of the poor, dismissed
an otherwise reasonable argument against
contraception as being rooted in the Dark
Ages along with abstinence programs and
rosary beads, sneered at the spiritual leader
of millions as our "over-embellished, over-
publicized king in Rome," and took a crass
and ignorant jab at the beautiful and re-
vered Gregorian chant and antiquated tra-
ditions of which I am a student and lover.
Any self-respecting Catholic should be
utterly insulted and disgusted at this Alli-
gator editorial.
Is this the best journalism and the best
reasoned and logical argument the Alliga-
tor can furnish to support its dripping ha-
tred of the Church? Shame on the Alligator

I don't object to the University's policy
of no UF-sanctioned, -sponsored, or ap-

sense from a safety and liability perspec-
tive. What I do object to is the University's
current stance that the students should not
be allowed to use footage from the stu-
dents post-earthquake, private return trips
because it would circumvent the travel
policy.
If the purpose of the policy is for safety
and risk reduction, then what interest is
served by censoring the thesis? Since stu-
dent safety concerns generally aren't impli-
cated by the presence of documentaries on
campus, the answer appears to be retalia-
tion for allegedly violating a policy that
doesn't even address penalties for students
who go on non-sanctioned trips to Haiti.
The footage highlights the aftermath of
one of the worst natural disasters in recent
memory and is of great public interest. The
prospect of a university administration ar-
bitrarily telling students (in their final se-
mester, no less) that they must take out es-
sential content of their thesis should not be
tolerated.

Columnist is cynical moron
CJ Pruner's column on Monday regard-
ing Jordan Johnson's political legacy had
a few minor errors that I want him to ac-
knowledge. One, while it is implied that
the article is written by CJ Pruner, I cannot
help but feel that others deserve credit for
its content, namely, Michael Moore movies
and malt liquor. Additionally, the article
concludes by saying that he is a "journal-
ism junior." I would like to recommend
a more appropriate description, perhaps
"cynical moron."
It is only appropriate that his guest col-
umn picture is of some goofy-looking kid
with his mouth wide open. I cannot imag-
ine a better visual representation of some-
one who thinks that his article is appropri-
ate for a student-run newspaper.

No new laws are being written, he said. The letter
just emphasizes a Gainesville city ordinance that says
a business can't discriminate on the basis of gender.
"I tend to agree with the ruling on it," said Dana
Rogers, owner of Art of Billiards.
Rogers, who recently stopped offering ladies night
specials because they weren't profitable, said many
bars have a two-hour special, which leads to women
drinking as much as possible in that time frame. Shealso said some men use ladies night to take advantage
of drunken women.
The Gainesville Office of Equal Opportunity has
never received a gender discrimination complaint re-

After retiring from that job,

to make a homemade barbecue
sauce.
"Tons of people wanted it,"
Pringle said. "He had his own pri-

supplied the sauce to for free."
A friend and former colleague,
Tom Harris, associate vice presi-
dent for administrative affairs,
said Sanders was a gentle man and
a gentleman who went the extra
mile for his students.
"He was a father to all of them,"Harris said. "Not only to his fam-

Grooveshark, which is owned by Escape Media Group,

source. The site runs on a business model of advertising
revenue and premium subscription fees.
Lyrissa Lidsky, professor of law at the Levin College of

model makes it very vulnerable to this copyright infringe-
ment suit.
"If I were Grooveshark, I'd be worried," Lidsky said.
She said the lawsuit may simply spur negotiations for a
special licensing deal between Universal Music Group and
Grooveshark.
Grooveshark negotiated a similar deal with Electric and
Musical Industries Ltd., a British music company, after
EMI sued the company last year.
Under this deal, Grooveshark pays to use music owned

Errors hurt No. 8 Gators in 7-2 loss to No. 4 'Noles
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF first baseman Preston Tucker committed one of the Gators' five errors Tuesday in their 7-2 loss to
FSU in Jacksonville. Five of the Seminoles' runs were unearned.0 FLORIDA COMMITTED FIVE
ERRORS.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
JACKSONVILLE -Riding a
five-game win streak, FSU didn't
need help to top UF.
That didn't stop the Gators from
lending a hand though.
No. 4 Florida State (20-4) scored
five runs off five Florida errors en
route to a 7-2 win at the Baseball
Grounds of Jacksonville on Tuesday
night. No. 8 UF (18-6) had commit-
ted 15 errors all season.
"That's something that's uncalled
for, especially with the defense we
have," second baseman Josh Adams
said. "I take that personal."
FSU designated hitter Stuart
Tapley scored the game's first run
in the second inning after reaching
on an error by right fielder Kamm
Washington, who ran past Tapley's
fly ball as it found the grass.
Tapley broke a tie again in the
fifth when he scored off another er-
ror, this time by Preston Tucker with
two outs to give the Seminoles a 3-2
lead."That was a ball that Preston
usually bodies up and keeps in front
of him," UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan
said. "I can't really put my finger on
it because we've been playing great
defense all year."
Another Gators miscue helped
the Seminoles extend their lead in
the seventh. Junior Mike McGee
hit a routine grounder to shortstop
Nolan Fontana, but third baseman
Austin Maddox cut in front.
Maddox missed the grounder,
distracting Fontana and allowing
McGee to reach first. McGee then
advanced on a wild pitch and scored
on a double by Seminoles right field-
er James Ramsey.
Maddox, who has started UF's
last five games at the hot corner, is
new to the position and committed
two errors Tuesday.
"That team that played tonight
wasn't us," Maddox said.
A pair of bad outings from An-
thony DeSclafani and facial injuries
to Tommy Toledo have ravaged
UF's pitching depth, allowing senior
Jeff Barfield to make his first start of
the season. Barfield, who made eight
relief appearances prior to Tuesday,
kept Florida State off balance with

FLORIDA LACROSSE
Cullen leads UF past Oregon
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Oregon scouted Florida well. It double-
teamed Ashley Bruns and kept UF's lead-
ing scorer scoreless for most of the first
half, but it had no answer for midfielder
Kitty Cullen.
Cullen led an efficient offense for the
Gators (7-4, 0-2 American Lacrosse Con-
ference) in a 16-6 win over the Ducks (4-7)
on Tuesday night.
She scored five of UF's 16 goals while
Bruns added three scores and three as-
sists. Attacker Caroline Cochran and mid-
fielders Colby Rhea and Brittany Dashiell
each added two goals on the night.
After a disappointing road loss to Ohio
State, Florida returned home hoping to put
the loss behind it with a win Tuesday over
the Ducks, and it came away with one of
its most complete games of the season.
The Gators played a nearly flawless of-
fensive game, completing routine passes
and making the more challenging ones
look easy. Long forgotten were the 17turnovers it had against Ohio State, as UF
made only six on the night.
The team was determined to dominate
the Ducks as it fought for and kept posses-
sion of the ball most of the night. Florida
picked up 16 of the 20 ground balls and
took 31 shots to the Ducks' 18.
Cullen said she and her teammates
knew the importance of
getting the win after the
draining defeat it suf-
fered last weekend, and
when Oregon doubled
Bruns, they knew what
they had to do.
Cullen "We knew that if
they were going to shut
her off that everyone else needed to step
up in her place," Cullen said.
UF's offensive play was the improve-
ment coach Amanda O'Leary needed to
see coming off the loss, especially when
Oregon contained Bruns.
"When [Bruns] has the opportunity
to go to goal, she has the green light, but
SEE LACROSSE, PAGE 15A lot to learn from Meyer v. Fowler
A week ago, UF football coach Ur-ban Meyer went on a rampage
and nearly crippled a reporter.
OK, not really, but for all the attention
the story got, he might as well have.
Meyer's public dressing-down of the
Orlando Sentinel's Jeremy Fowler is well-
known, but seven days later, there are still
some fuzzy edges to the story. A closer
look at the incident shows how a conver-
sation between a coach and reporter be-
comes national news -and how nearly
everyone involved is to blame: Meyer,
sports information staffers, reporters,
Fowler and the Sentinel.
Last Monday, receiver Deonte Thomp-
son made his infamous "real quarter-
back" statement comparing John Brantley
to Tim Tebow.
He wasn't asked to clarify it, but to me,
it's clear he meant "traditional" by "real."
No matter your interpretation, that
doesn't meet the standard required toclassify the quote
as a "rip job" of
Tebow, but that's
how Fowler wrote
it on his blog later
Mike McCall that day.
McCailin' It Fowler ed-
Like I See It ited the post a few
mmccall@alligator org hours later, remov-
ing the suggestive
rip-job line, but in a
business where it's a race to be the first to
publish and blogs and tweets are viewed
by readers right away, it's enough to af-
fect opinions.
Fowler's later-edited sentence couldn't
have been solely responsible, but the
quote soon blew up into a national story,
and Meyer started yelling.
The most obvious mistake was by
Meyer, who was wrong and unprofes-
sional to handle things the way he did.

UF struggles to replace Toledo
0 THE SOPHOMORE HAS BEEN OUT
SINCE MARCH 14.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achia ng@a Iligator org
Tommy Toledo is not the only one who has been
affected by his injury -the Gators are still trying to
pick themselves up after the incident.
Ever since the sophomore was hit in the face by a
comebacker on March 14, Florida has been looking
for somebody to step up for the injured pitcher.
UF tried plugging freshman Hudson Randall
into Toledo's usual weekend spot in the rotation,
but that move hasn't been as successful as coach
Kevin O'Sullivan would have liked.
In his last weekend start, Randall lasted one in-
ning and gave up five runs on six hits Saturday.
And usual midweek starter Anthony DeSclafani
has struggled all season with a 7.84 ERA.
So O'Sullivan tried something different against
No. 4 FSU Tuesday. He gave his bullpen a chance
to collectively fill the void.
Senior pitcher Jeff Barfield, usually a reliever,
got his first start of the season, but he didn't lastlong. The right-hander rung up three hitters in two
innings of work.
"[Barfield was only going to go through the
line up once because we need him for this week-
end," O'Sullivan said.
From there the bullpen took over.
Justin Poovey, Randall, Nick Maronde and Kev-
in Chapman all pitched in relief against FSU in the
bullpen-heavy game.
But O'Sullivan's new method
didn't provide a different result.
They combined to pitch seven
innings while giving up six runs,
two of them earned. Despite all
of the runs coming off five er-
rors, the bullpen kept Florida in
Toledo the game. FSU was up just 5-2 in
the seventh until Chapman gave
up a two-run homer in the ninth.
"We had plenty of arms. It's not like we pitched
poorly," O'Sullivan said. "Things got away from us
at the end with Chapman on the mound."
With Toledo's return in question, finding a
replacement will be an ongoing process that the
Gators need to figure out as they head into the
heart of their conference schedule.BABhALL, from page 14
his curveball.
But O'Sullivan did not use Bar-
field as a traditional starter, pulling
him after he allowed zero earned
runs in two innings.
With no pitcher able to throw
deep in the game, the Gators used
six hurlers.
FSU reliever Brian Busch
earned the win Tuesday, pitching
4.1 scoreless innings and allowing
three hits. Busch and starter Geoff
Parker combined to strike out 10
UF batters.
"Our older guys just got to step
up and play better -it's as simple
as that," O'Sullivan said. "We faced
Parker multiple times .you see a
guy over and over and over, I'm
disappointed in the strikeouts."The Gators' offense managed
two runs on six hits against the
'Noles, both runs coming off a sec-
ond-inning homer by designated
hitter Tyler Thompson. The sopho-
more pulled a pitch that barely car-
ried past the right-field fence.
UF wasted a potentially pro-
ductive fourth inning when the
team failed to cap-
italize on a leadoff
double by Mad-
dox, who finished
Baseball the game 2for 4.
With Maddox
on third, left field-
er Daniel Pigott popped out and
Thompson grounded out to end
the frame.
Florida is 1-2 against FSU, and
the two teams will meet for a final
time April 13 in Tallahassee.
Gators limit Ducks' leading two score
LACROSSE, from page 14rs to iust three goals
she was really smart tonight,"
O'Leary said. "They were
doubling her on the crease,
and she just made really good
decisions."
Defensively, the Gators
successfully cleared 16 of their
17 opportunities, did not al-
low their opponent to go on
runs and were able to contain
the Ducks' two leading scor-
ers, Jana Drummond and Alex
Breiner.
The duo, which has scored
57 of the Ducks' 138 goals this
season, was limited to just
three Tuesday.
UF goalkeeper Cara Can-
ington gave up just two sec-
ond-half scores and recorded
seven saves in the net.
"The defense got the mo-
mentum going on the offen-
sive side, shut down their big
players, and they weren't able
to score," Canington said.
"Our big goal today was,
'If they're going to score, let's
make sure they don't score for
another five or ten minutes;don't let them get the momen-
tum.'
UF did a solid job of avoid-
ing the run and a slump when
the Ducks put a quick score on
the board to start the second
half.
"The defense got the
momentum going on
the offensive side, shut
down their big players,
and they weren't able
to score."

Instead it responded with
six straight scores to seal the
victory.
"When you set goals and
you put things forth to this
group, they've been able to
achieve them," O'Leary said.
"We definitely have struggled
on the road, and that's been
a problem, but here at home,
they are pretty darn good."Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff

But another is UF's current in-
terview policy, which restricts ac-
cess to group question sessions and
is monitored by sports information
staff. Players rarely say anything the
least bit interesting, and if they do,
they probably won't appear for in-
terviews anytime soon, making it a
bigger deal when someone speaks
UP.
The next mistake was shutting
off interviews Wednesday as pun-
ishment for Thompson's comments
going viral. Give a group of report-
ers nothing to report on except
for Meyer yelling, and that's what
they're going to write about.
The situation got awkward fastfor Fowler, who declined comment
for this story. No reporter aims to
be the center of the story, especially
in this kind of situation, but that's
where he landed.
A "Jeremy Fowler" tag even
had to be added to Fowler's blog,
Swamp Things, for filing purposes,
certainly not something Fowler or
any reporter aspires to require.
Fowler is a genuinely nice guy
and a distinguished alligatorSports
alum, but that doesn't mean he
didn't make mistakes, and other
members of the media need to take
some responsibility for this going as
far as it did.
But they won't.
You won't hear TV and radio
hosts apologize for not bothering toget the full context of the quote, and
you won't hear the Sentinel or other
news outlets publicly admit they
made a mistake.
Sentinel Sports Topics Manager
Tim Stephens said in a statement,
"Jeremy Fowler's story was accu-
rate and presented in context. Urban
Meyer's outburst, directed at Jer-
emy, was unwarranted and will not
deter our efforts to report on Univer-
sity of Florida sports."
The first part of Stephens' state-
ment is correct, if you change that
first "was" to an "is." As I mentioned
before, the original blog post did call
Thompson's quote a rip job.
Now -it is frequently linked
to as proof that Fowler did nothing
wrong -it reads fairly. But it didn'talways, and I don't see why the pa-
per wouldn't be transparent about
edits.
The day of the incident, another
change was made. The line, "[Mey-
er] was coming to play better de-
fense than he can coach in honor of
Thompson," was cut without men-
tion. That can be taken either as a
slight to Meyer's ability to coach
defense or to say Meyer was about
to seriously D up. Without clarifica-
tion, we don't know.
And that's the mistake that re-
porters who ran with the Thompson
quote made -they didn't try to find
out what he meant.
A few days before Thompson
spoke, one player hinted that he
wasn't satisfied with a coach lastseason. When a reporter -Fowler
-did his due diligence and asked
a follow-up for clarification, the in-
terview was ended by a UF staffer.
This isn't uncommon, as any con-
troversial topics normally draw one
of the Three-T's (trainer, tutoring,
treatment) as reasons to cut off the
questions.
This flare-up wasn't really han-
dled well by anyone involved, but
it's time for everyone to move on
and get back to their respective jobs:
catching (and sometimes dropping)
passes, writing stories, setting up in-
terviews and coaching football.
But hopefully this can be a learn-
ing experience.
If not, Meyer might actually crip-
ple the next reporter.WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 15

UF aims to end struggles with top pitchers against UCF
Ana Goni-Lessan/ Alligator Staff
UF junior Kelsey Bruder and the Gators have gone 1-2 against pitch-
ers with an ERA less than 1.50 this season.By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
Although the Gators are one of
the most prolific offensive teams
in the nation, everything seems to
change when they go up against
top pitching.
While Florida leads the South-
eastern Conference in home runs
and slugging percentage, the team
has only scored four runs in 19 in-
nings against pitchers with an ERA
less than 1.50, and are batting just
.162 in that span despite hitting a
combined .349 against all other op-
ponents.
The No. 6 Gators (23-4, 6-2 SEC)
get a chance to improve on those
numbers when they travel to Or-
lando to take on UCF (22-12, 7-1
Conference USA) and pitcher Ash-
leigh Cole tonight at 7.
So far this season, Cole is 14-6
with a 1.37 ERA, and has led the
Knights to upsets of SEC powers
Tennessee and Alabama.
In UF's three games against
pitchers of that caliber, the Gators
are just 1-2.
They were shut out by Georgia
Tech's Hope Rush (16-3, 1.38 ERA)
in just the second game of the sea-
son, and suffered the same fate at
the hands of Stanford's Teagan
Gerhart (18-3, 1.28 ERA), who al-
lowed just two hits in her outing.
Their lone win came againstAuburn's Anna Thompson (9-5,
1.06 ERA), who threw 4.2 innings
of no-hit softball before being
tagged for four runs with two outs
in the fifth.
"Our offense really came to-
gether and made adjustments,"
Kelsey Bruder said. "We all talked
about her pitches and what we
were seeing and our body place-
ment in the box."
Although the back-to-back
home runs the Gators hit to knock
Thompson from the game are a
positive sign, there is still plenty
left to prove.
Thompson is a pitcher who is
successful primar-
ily because of her
velocity, which is
not what the Gators'Softball batters fear most at
the plate.
Both Bruder and senior Franc-
esca Enea agree that rotation, and
not speed, is the hardest thing to
handle as a hitter.
"The slower pitching with more
movement is the hardest for me
because I can't control my hips for
that long," Enea said.
Although facing top-notch
pitchers is inherently more dif-
ficult than normal, the UF hitters
do their best to fight the urge to
change too much.
Enea, Bruder and senior Corrie
Brooks all agree that staying con-sistent and not trying to make too
many adjustments is key against
the best competition.
"You have to try to do every-
thing the same," Brooks said. "You
can't over-think yourself because
that's when things are going to go
wrong."
If UF struggles against certain
pitchers, it is not due to a lack of
preparation.
Each week, coach Tim Walton
and his assistants gather whatever
statistics and film they can to try to
give hitters as much information
as possible about who and what
they will be up against.
"We see what type of pitching
it is, if it's a drop, rise, curve or
screw," Enea said. "We just start
by looking at those type of things
and then do a bunch of different
things to get ready for it."
Above all, the Gators hitters
know how important it is to keep
their confidence up in those situa-
tions.
Perhaps none know better than
Bruder, who was 0 for 2 with a
strikeout against Thompson before
delivering one of the home runs
that led to her removal.
"The only thing that's different
is they're going to have their out
pitches, so you can't get down on
yourself when you don't produce
exactly how you want," Bruder
said.
