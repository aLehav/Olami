  This year, Gainesville’s Solid Waste Management di-
vision is ﬁ  ghting breast cancer — with pretty, pink trash 
carts.
  Gainesville’s Roll Breast Cancer to the Curb team for 
the American Cancer Society’s Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk is raising money for the event by sell-ing the carts.
  About 45 households that ordered the pink carts will receive them over the next few weeks, said Terri Raimer, a customer service representative for City of Gainesville Solid Waste. 
  The campaign is sponsored by Waste Corporation of 
America, which sells and delivers the carts. 
  Pink carts are available through the solid waste divi-sion for $50. The cost of the cart is separate from monthly waste collection fees. All of the money from the sale of the carts goes directly to Making Strides Against Breast Cancer. 
  Raimer said she will take more orders for pink carts 
through October, but about 50 more households will have to order them to justify another delivery.
  “Unless we get a big participation, we may not be able 
to order another bunch,” she said.  City sells pink trash cans to support breast cancer walk

  Fliers, meetings, Facebook statuses and 
banners have led up to this critical time: Student Government elections.
  Undergraduate and graduate students 
can vote from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. today and Wednesday. 
Students will vote  to ﬁ  ll 50 Senate seats 
from candidates from the Unite Party, can-didates from the Students Party and inde-pendent candidates. 
  In fall elections, students vote for can-
didates to represent the areas where they live.
  This year, SG is trying out a new “se-
cure location electronic voting” system. Students will be able to vote on a computer at any of the on-campus voting locations. 
  Student Senate President Micah Lewis 
said SG switched to “make voting more secure and accessible for students.” Lewis proposed the new voting system during the summer.
  In past elections, stu-
dents ﬁ  lled out paper bal-lots.
  To vote, students must 
have their photo IDs and UFID numbers. 
Students will not be 
able to vote from personal 
computers or from home.
  The number of polling 
locations recently increased from 10 to 11 separate locations. 
Students can vote at the Broward Hall 
basement, the Murphree Common Area, Springs Hall’s room C201, the Jennings Hall ﬁ  rst-ﬂ  oor library, the Southwest Rec-reation Center’s lounge, the Reitz Union Computer Lab, the law school’s common area near its lounge, the CSE Computer Lab, Marston Science Library, McCarty Hall’s Computer Lab B and the JHMHSC Library Collaboration Center.

  UF students can soon 
avoid the all-too-common 
wait associated with group ﬁ  tness classes. 
  On Wednesday, the UF 
Department of Recreation-al Sports Board of Direc-tors voted to implement a new online registration system for these classes.
  The new registration 
system will be available beginning Oct. 24, said Ambre Sheehy, RecSports coordinator for ﬁ  tness.
  Under this new system, 
online registration for a group ﬁ  tness class will open 25 hours prior to the start time of the class. 
  Participants will be al-
lowed to cancel any res-ervations without penalty for up to three hours be-fore the class begins. 
  The old number sys-
tem called for students to arrive ahead of time for a class and receive a num-ber on a ﬁ  rst-come, ﬁ  rst-served basis in order to be admitted to a class. 
  “The number system 
worked, but it wasn’t per-fect,” Sheehy said. “This new system is more con-venient for students.” 
  Any student or mem-
ber who has access to the RecSports facilities will be able to sign up for a class at recsports.uﬂ  .edu.  RecSports puts 
sign-ups online

St. Petersburg Times journalist 
and UF alumnus Jeff Klinkenberg 
urged Floridians to take action and defend their history Monday in the Pugh Hall Ocora Room. 
“Get off your butts, and speak 
up about the things that matter to you,” Klinkenberg said.
One of those things that mat-
ters to Klinkenberg is the preser -
vation of Florida culture. 
“I’m not a political writer — 
I’m a storyteller,” he said. 
Klinkenberg’s way of telling 
authentic stories of real Floridians is what separates him from other writers, said 74-year-old Freder -
ick “Freddie” William Wood Jr. III, Evinston post office owner.
Klinkenberg said beneath ev-
ery story, there is a deeper story. 
The key to getting a good 
story, he said, is peeling back the layers.
“Sometimes stories are ob-
vious, but what’s below them is what makes them richer,” Klinkenberg said.
Mike Foley, UF journalism 
professor, said Klinkenberg re-ally demonstrates the power of storytelling.
“It’s a real gift,” said Foley, 65.
Klinkenberg said things aren’t 
that complicated if you want to do your part in preserving the past. He said taking advantage of one’s surroundings is what it means to be a Floridian.
“Some people live in Florida 
and never become Floridians,” Klinkenberg said. 
Political science student Joey 
Whitesman, 19, said the fact that old Florida is disappearing really crushes the culture that exists here.
“If everywhere looks the same, 
why go anywhere?” Whitesman said. 
Whitesman said he tries regu-
larly to take Klinkenberg’s advice about exploring. 
“You see things you haven’t — 
and probably would never see — when you go off the beaten path,” Whitesman said.
When asked what his best sto-
ries are, Klinkenberg said they are always the ones he doesn’t go looking for.  
“When you are just traveling 
and exploring, and stories just fall in your lap — those are the best ones.”

� TEN PERCENT OF EACH PURCHASE IS DONATED 
TO RELIEF EFFORTS IF YOU MENTION “HAITI” AT CHECKOUT.
BENJAMIN S. BRASCH
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students can get tutoring and give aid to a country in need 
by using one word: Haiti.
Mentioning Haiti at checkout knocks 10 percent off a stu-
dent’s purchase at StudyEdge. Another 10 percent of the sale 
will go to Gators United for Haiti to donate to relief funds.“That’s the easiest way somebody can help us,” said Emily 
Nyren, president of Gators United for Haiti. “Everyone wins.”
Nyren, who is not of Haitian descent, became involved in 
the organization after hearing that a hotel in Haiti had col-lapsed during the 2009 earthquake. Her father had stayed in the building during a previous trip to the country to volunteer with Food for the Poor.
“People that get involved with the cause aren’t always di-rectly impacted,” she said. “Not being Haitian, I still saw the need of the Haitian people.”
Students buying StudyEdge packets online can still save 10 
percent by entering “Haiti” as a promotional code.
Gator United for Haiti will host its second 5K race to raise 
money for a charity of their choosing.
This year, the 5K race will be on Oct. 15. Runners can regis-
ter online at gatorsunitedforhaiti.com or from Oct. 3 to 14 either on Turlington Plaza or on the Reitz Union Colonnade.
Samuel Joseph, vice president of Gators United for Haiti, 
said the donations last year went to Yélé Haiti, the American Red Cross, Planting Peace and Partners in Health, all of which provide aid to Haiti-related causes.Tutoring service donating portion of revenue to Haiti aid groups

New data indicate more young people 
have health insurance now than they did last 
year.
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention estimated that Americans ages 19 to 25 without insurance fell to 9.1 million in the first quarter of 2011 from 10 million in 2010, or to 30.4 percent  from 33.9 percent.  
Almost 1 million young adults nationwide have signed up for health insurance in the past year, according to the CDC.
Another poll by Gallup found that 24.2 
percent of 18- to 25-year-olds were uninsured in the second quarter of this year. That’s down from 28 percent in the third quarter of 2010. 
The U.S. Census Bureau reported similar drops in uninsured young adults. Most people who gained coverage did it through private policies, not government programs, according to the Census Bureau. 
Proponents of the Affordable Care Act, 
Obama’s health plan, are using these numbers as evidence that the new law is having a posi-tive impact. 
In September, the law began allowing 
young adults up to the age of 26 to remain as dependents on their parents’ health plans. They are not eligible if they have an offer of employer-based coverage. 
Previously , youths were off their parents’ 
policies at age 18, or 21 or when they left col-lege.
Michael Gold, an insurance agent with In-
surance for College Students, doesn’t think this recent trend is because of the new law. 
“People are buying insurance to buy insur -
ance,” he said. 
Gold sells insurance to college students at 
Florida universities, including UF. He has seen more UF students buying insurance, but that’s been a trend over the last 20 years, he said.
Students are not required to have health 
insurance at UF.
“The university and Student Health Care 
Center policy is that students should have health insurance, although [it is] not currently required unless they are an international stu-dent,” said Catherine Seemann, marketing specialist at the SHCC.
Because the university does not require 
health insurance or ask about it during ad-missions, the SHCC does not have the exact number of privately insured students, which would include students on their parents’ plans. However, in 2008 the U.S. Government Accountability Office released numbers indi-cating that at major universities, 80 percent of students were insured and 20 percent were uninsured, Seemann said. 
UF offers a university-sponsored health 
care plan to undergraduate students. 
As of Sept. 22, about 1,900 students were 
on Plan 2, which is considered the major medical plan, and 208 students were on Plan 3, which is considered the supplemental plan. Both of these numbers are for the pol-icy year that began Aug.14, Seemann said.  
Although Seeman did not specify the number of students on university-sponsored plans last fall, she said they were similar to this year’s numbers.
Under the new health care law, most 
Americans will need some kind of health in-surance by 2014.
Gold said he believes there will be more 
people buying insurance between now and then. 
He said the increase is just the nature of 
health insurance today.KEILANI RODRIGUEZ

For its movie night competition, 
Team Florida made popcorn and 
played the movie “Inception.” 
Pamela Cotera, a first-year PhD 
candidate in interior design, said this was appropriate because of the central theme of architecture. 
For a recent project, UF students 
designed a solar-powered, energy-efficient house and made it a reality — the FLeX House.
UF students teamed up with 
students from the  University of South Florida, Florida State Univer -
sity and the University of Central Florida to build the house. The four universities formed Team Florida, and the FLeX House is their entry into the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2011.
Team Florida is one of 19 teams 
currently competing in the solar de-cathlon, which runs until Sunday. The competition is comprised of 10 contests, including architecture, market appeal, affordability, energy balance and home entertainment, a contest in which teams put on  movie nights for their neighbors.
The goal of the FLeX House was 
to build a flexible house that would appeal to a design- and sustainabil-ity-savvy couple, said Cotera, the team’s lead interior designer.
“We’re showing people what 
the new technologies are and some of the easy ways to use a couple to improve your own consumption,” she said.
Each university had a different 
contribution to the FLeX House. USF was responsible for architec-ture, FSU for engineering, UCF for the home’s smart systems and UF for interior design.
One of the house’s unique quali-
ties — and one of the reasons for its name — is the flexibility of the design itself. The one-bedroom, one-bathroom house is comprised of three modules, two of which fit into the largest piece. The entire unit was transported on one semi-trailer.
The team started planning in 
August 2010 and completed the de-sign at the end of last semester. The house was constructed in Tampa during the summer, and in Septem-ber it was deconstructed and trans-ported to Washington D.C. for the competition.
The team built the FLeX House 
specifically for a Florida climate. It was built with impact-resistant glass capable of enduring a Catego-ry 3 hurricane. Taking Florida’s hu-midity into consideration, the team incorporated a system that acts as a dehumidifier in the house.
When building the house, the 
group stayed within its budget, which was between $250,000 and $300,000.
“People always have this im-
pression that to be efficient, it is going to cost an enormous amount of money,” Cotera said. “For all the design aspects and innovative tech-nologies, it’s well within the range of being affordable.”
Last year, UF’s team was voted 
fan favorite in an international so-lar decathlon. Those interested in following the competition or in vot-ing for this year’s People’s Choice Award can visit solardecathlon.

Gainesville residents can now learn Spanish without the 
hassle of taking a university course.
A local company, Gainesville Spanish Tutoring, began of-
fering classes this semester.
The new company is geared to teaching adults who want 
to travel to Spanish-speaking countries but are unsure be-
cause of the language barrier.
“There are no other businesses in the area that teach Span-ish for adults ... like we plan to do it,” said Tim Carswell, cre-ator of the program.
The program offers Gainesville residents several options 
to choose from to learn or practice their Spanish: Survival Spanish: A Boot Camp for Travelers, El Dinero: Spanish for Business, La Doctora: Spanish for Medical Professions, Begin-ning Spanish Level I, Intermediate Spanish Level I and Span-ish on Sundays.
Survival Spanish is a monthlong, high-intensity course 
that begins Oct. 3 and is intended for people who are going abroad and want to have a better experience.
Beginner and intermediate courses will start on Oct. 24 
and 25, respectively. Classes will be taught at Brain Works inside Tower 24 Center, located at 2445 SW 76th St., from 7:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.
Gainesville residents can take the courses for $499 a month, 
which includes the classes, a book and a coursepack. 
Another program this new company offers is Spanish on 
Sundays, a free bilingual meet-up, that takes place every Sun-day at 6:30 p.m. at Tapas and Tinis, located at 2725 SW 91st St. 
“Nobody offers a short-term course for people that are 
traveling abroad for volunteering or business,” Carswell said. “No other company in town teaches like this.” Tutoring service offers specialized Spanish classes for adults“People are buying insurance to

Never say it’s impossible.
That was the theme of former Dis-
ney Imagineer Mark Hickson’s speech Monday night at Orange & Brew.
The event took place at 8 p.m., and it 
concluded the Reitz Union Board’s Dis-ney Week festivities, said Victoria Jeter, director of lectures and comedians for the Reitz Union Board Entertainment.About 100 people came out to hear 
Hickson, who spoke on the challenges he faced as an Imagineer.
When looking for a speaker, Jeter 
stumbled upon Hickson’s blog and was impressed by his work with Disney.
“Mark had dreamed of becoming an 
Imagineer all his life,” she said.
As an Imagineer, Hickson has done 
more than 30 projects with Tokyo Dis-neyland, Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World. 
Each project, Hickson said, taught 
him that anything was possible.
“When you’re faced with obstacles 
that seem impossible, you’re strength-ened by those experiences,” he said.
Hickson, who drew his own maps of 
Disney World in third grade, highlight-ed 17 different Imagineers in his speech. Those people ranged from creative di-rectors and model makers to show pro-ducers and ride engineers.
Political science alumna Ashley 
Kecskes said she’s always dreamed of working at Disney . Her hope, she said, is to go back to school and study me-chanical engineering.
“I want to be a creative designer and 
design new rides,” she said.
Electrical engineering freshman 
Matthew Wener said he knows there will be a lot of challenges  in the road ahead as an engineering student. He hoped Hickson’s message would en-courage him and other students to work through those obstacles.
Jeter said she hoped Hickson’s mes-
sage had a positive impact on students.
“You can always try ,” she said. 
“That’s definitely something that I would want people to get out of it.”
Looking back at his experience, 
Hickson recalled the moment he found out his dream of becoming a Disney Imagineer was about to become reality.
“I think I had a little pixie dust in my

� ONLY ONE NON-STUDENT WAS EJECTED 
AFTER 12 EJECTIONS THE WEEK BEFORE.
ERIN JESTER
Alligator Writer
There were no student ejections and only one 
non-student ejection from the Gators football game 
against the Kentucky Wildcats on Saturday, accord-ing to University of Kentucky police Chief Joe Mon-roe. 
“This [game’s fans were] fairly well-behaved for 
the most part,” Monroe said. 
The number of ejections was low compared to the 
dozen people who were thrown out of  Common-wealth stadium in Lexington, Ky., during the previ-ous week’s game.
Twenty-three people were ejected from the Gators 
game versus the University of Alabama at Birming-ham on Sept. 10.
Another 89 people were ejected from the Univer -
sity of Tennessee game on Sept. 17. 
Twenty-three of the 89 were ejected for standing 
on the bleachers.
Monroe said the low number of ejections may 
have been because many people left the stadium well before the game was over. 
Monroe said most ejections are for violating the 
rule that alcohol isn’t allowed in the stadium. Alco-hol is not allowed in most SEC college football sta-diums.Stadium ejection 
numbers low for Kentucky game

51% NOMonday’s question: Are you going to 
vote in this week’s Student Government elections? Today’s question: Would you consider buying a pink 
trash can for a good cause?The Choice Is Yours
Low voter turnout 
the biggest SG issue
Every semester, the Alligator Editorial Board endorses a 
Student Government party, candidate or issue to better help you, the students, decide whom to vote for when you 
step up to the polls. 
We interview each party about its inner working knowledge 
of SG and what timelines it has drawn up for the opening of a 24-hour library or the expansion of RTS services.
Well, great. Each party had some nice things to say and ideas 
that really wouldn’t be that difficult to follow through on. But honestly, we were too distracted by the fact that no one votes anyway to be able to take any of that into serious consideration.
The Editorial Board has decided not to endorse a party or 
candidate this semester, because honestly , we don’t care. We’ll cover them either way.
We want you to pick. That is the most important thing.You have a problem with tuition hikes? How do you feel 
about how much money was given to Gator Growl to pay for a band you may or may not like?
Hello. SG is your outlet to do something about that.And for some reason, only a small fraction of the Student 
Body ever comes out to vote. That fraction doesn’t include those of you who vote only so you can collect the infamous “I voted” sticker.
Why? Why don’t more people care where $17 million of their 
fees is going? 
We know you have been made aware of the elections. Party 
members are shoving fliers down your throat on every campus sidewalk. We’ve run stories on the front page of the paper. 
What we learned from our endorsement interviews with the 
parties this semester is that they both have the ideas, the means and the abilities to make a change for the better at UF. 
We’ll do our duty to continue reporting on each one in the 
future, and we’ll do it objectively , just like we’re supposed to. 
But if you’re tired of reading the same old Student Senate 
story every Wednesday (honestly, we’re running out of headline ideas for them), go out and vote for someone who will make a change on the Senate floor. 
Semester after semester, we hear people ripping the parties 
to shreds. 
“Unite senators are just there to promote their frats.”“The (whatever-it’s-called-this-semester) party is just there to 
argue.”
Whatever. Each party slates an idiot or two who doesn’t be-
long in SG. We know that. But don’t make the mistake of as-suming every candidate  doesn’t have great ideas or doesn’t sin-cerely want to represent you to the best of his or her ability, no matter his or her party affiliation. 
Go vote for them. Hold SG accountable. V ote for who you 
want to vote for. 
Neither the Editorial Board nor the parties can force you to 
care about SG. We can simply do our best to inform you about the issues. The three of us have the same goal: We want to serve you.
But at some point, you have to start serving yourself.The ladies can make us laugh too
“New Girl.”
“2 Broke Girls.”“Whitney.”
We get it, new TV shows. You’re capitalizing on the 
very cool female talent that’s in comedy these days.
You do not, however, have to hit us over the head 
with it or convince us to love them all right away. Shows like “30 Rock” or “Parks and Recreation” have female leads, but they don’t flaunt it.
Do you know how many times Amy Poehler has been 
asked about breaking ground as a female comedian?
Too many.She now calls that question “boring.” It’s sad that being a woman in comedy is still consid-
ered news. Let’s try evaluating a television series based on talent, regardless of who’s in charge.
That’s where I’m coming from this week. I was excited for two of those new shows because of 
the concepts and the creative power of the ensembles be-hind them. 
Here’s what I thought:“New Girl” In a really cool marketing move, the show was re-
leased for Internet-viewership about a week before the television premiere. It was available to download for free on iTunes, so I was able to get a head start on loving this show. 
I get that a lot of people complain about Zooey De-
schanel’s “manic, pixie dream girl” typecasting, but I think this show is honestly trying to get away from that. 
The premise of the show is original enough: boy cheats 
on girl, girl moves into an apartment with three dudes whom she found on Craigslist and hilarity ensues. 
Sure, they try to push the nerd jokes a little too hard; 
they might even exaggerate the difference between ladies and men a tad too much. But as far as first episodes go, the characters were firmly established in an entertaining way. This show definitely has a balance of obvious quirk-iness and real heart.
“2 Broke Girls” I figured this show might be 
a little tricky; I’m usually not a fan of sitcoms on CBS — just as a general rule. But, I had faith for two reasons: Kat Dennings, making the move from the big screen just like our pal Zooey, is one of my favorite people of all time; and Molly McAleer, one of the writers for the show and co-
creators of hellogiggles.com is the perfect storm of edgy and girly. The show works from a basis of stereotypes but with a smile. People watch TV to escape, so this show is set in as real of a world as possible. 
I’m totally interested in what will happen next week, 
mainly so I can figure out if I really like it, or if I’ve been blinded by my lady-loves. Either way, I’m proud of CBS for not relying mostly on genitalia jokes for their laugh mileage. 
And for using a Peter, Bjorn and John tune as the 
theme song.
“Whitney”Starring Whitney Cummings (co-creator/co-producer 
for “2 Broke Girls”), the show follows Whitney and her crazy, whack-a-doodle life. It claims, at the very begin-ning of the episode, that it’s taped in front of a live studio audience; the jarring laugh track begs to differ, though. 
I don’t think I laughed out loud once during the entire 
episode; just a few chuckles to myself. The situations and characters felt a bit forced and uncomfortable at times. 
I’m definitely not judging the entire series based on 
the pilot. If everyone did that, hardly any shows would be renewed for multiple seasons. I’m excited to see where the show ends up going. 
Pretty soon, there will only be TV shows called “Girls” 
or “Funny Ladies Make You Laugh.”
Or “Gilmore Girls.”I just really miss “Gilmore Girls,” OK?Sami Main is a journalism junior at UF. Her column ap-

  The Students Party’s mission is sim-
ple:  We want to help you take back your Student Government and your 
university. For too long, the average stu-dent has not had a voice in Student Gov-ernment, and if elected, the Students Party promises to be that voice.
  The Unite Party, which is currently 
in control of Student Government, has proven itself to be corrupt, self-serving, re-pressive and incompetent.  Unfortunately, less than 20 percent of the Student Body participates in SG elections, and as a re-sult, Unite controlled has 99 percent of SG since Spring 2009. And what has this got-ten us?  A corrupt, bloated and inefﬁ  cient body that wastes money, pads resumes and consistently acts against the interests of the average student.
  Here are just a few examples:   While the recent recession has many 
students struggling to make ends meet, the Student Body president (a member of the Unite Party) voted to increase our tuition by 15 percent.  Additionally, every year Unite has been in power, Bright Futures and other ﬁ  nancial aid has been severely cut. And what did SG do to ﬁ  ght on your behalf? Nothing.  
  While our cost of attendance is sky-
rocketing, the $17.7 million SG budget (of which every student pays about $400 per year) is riddled with waste. Just last week, Unite voted to give a $71,000 bailout to Gator Growl and additionally decided to pay $13,000 for a SG agency website (in-stead of having students design the site for a fraction of the cost).
  Alarmingly, all of this is occurring 
while top SG/Unite Party ofﬁ  cials are tak-ing multi-thousand dollar salaries, in ad-dition to multi-thousand dollar meal cards and more than $100 every month in cell-phone plans.
  Enough is enough.  We need a Stu-
dent Government that advocates on behalf of students, not one that blindly 
sides with the administration almost every chance it gets. We need a Student Govern-ment that uses its budget to improve this university, not one that takes tens of thou-sands in salaries and other perks. We need a Student Government that appoints stu-dents based on merit, not one that trades positions in exchange for votes for the rul-ing party. And most importantly, we need a Student Government that represents all students, not one with a ruling party that only represents itself.
  If elected, the Students Party will be 
your voice and your advocate. In the Sen-ate, we will ﬁ  ght for the entire Student Body, not just the select few. You have the right to a fair and honest Student Govern-ment that is not plagued with abuses of power.  We promise to end the corruption and make SG accountable to you.
  To the members of the Students Party, 
being a student senator is not just a resume line that requires once-a-week attendance. If elected, we will tirelessly ﬁ  ght against unreasonable tuition increases, eliminate wasteful spending, increase transparency and respond to the needs of the average student. We promise to never stop work-ing to improve this university.
  Our candidates are passionate, dedicat-
ed and intelligent. They all have an ideal blend of experience, and new and exciting ideas that will bring common-sense solu-tions to SG.
  Bottom line:  If you want a fair and hon-
est government that is responsive to your needs, get off the sidelines, join the ﬁ  ght to take back your university and vote for the Students Party today and tomorrow. 
Students Party
Speaking Out   Founded in Spring 2009, the Unite 
Party has always focused on better-ing student life, increasing student 
safety, enhancing academics, increasing transparency and working toward sus-tainability. Since our inception, we have generated ﬁ  ve platforms, created by the students, to further improve everyday life, both on and off campus.  Each of our platforms has been completed by our candidates within their term of being elected to ofﬁ  ce, and we look to continue this tradition of working to enhance stu-dent life at the University of Florida. 
  With our experience and communi-
cation, the Unite Party has stopped the implementation of block tuition indeﬁ  -nitely. 
The Unite Party also brought Redbox 
to the steps of the Reitz Union, imple-mented a tax-free day at the Reitz Union bookstore for textbook purchases, suc-cessfully negotiated Microsoft Ofﬁ  ce at a special UF student price of $15 for life, extended SNAP hours, created late night study at the Reitz Union, brought Got-cha! rides to campus, substantially de-creased room rental rates for student or-ganizations at the Reitz Union and was instrumental in the recent expansion of Southwest Recreation Center. 
We have increased funding for all 
student organizations, multicultural and diversity affairs, mental health aware-ness and graduate and international stu-dent affairs.
   This fall, the Unite Party is focused on 
going back to the basics. Students across campus spoke to us during our platform generation and we listened. Students are most concerned with the lack of a 24-hour study center on campus, and we pledge to have this implemented within our term in ofﬁ  ce. Along with 
this, the Unite Party plans on increasing the 
amount of SNAP vehicles, increasing water bottle reﬁ  ll fountains, increasing bicycle signs and safety around campus, building awnings at campus bus stops and creating international campus direc-tories for graduate students in different languages. 
  Our accomplishments are only pos-
sible with hardworking, talented and driven people. 
Our full Fall 2011 Unite Party candi-
date slate is experienced, qualiﬁ  ed and diverse. They want to make a difference on this campus. These candidates have been out campaigning for more than a week and a half and will continue to show their dedication to the students if elected. The Unite Party candidates have the best ability to represent their districts and residence halls and provide tangible results. 
The Unite Party was founded to take 
Student Government into a positive new direction. These candidates will surely exceed that goal and better student life both on and off campus.
  With the Unite Party’s background 
of experience, communication and tan-gible results, the Fall 2011 Unite Party candidates will continue to enhance the student experience at the University of Florida. 
They will be dedicated to serving you, 
the student, during your time at UF. 
Vote for experience, communication 
and tangible results. Vote to continue a positive direction. 
Vote to unite this campus as one 
on Sept. 27 and 28. Go Unite, and Go Gators!

JoAnn Alarid poses with a pink trash cart bought to support 
the 2010 Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk.
The walk will 
be held Oct. 22
The carts are part of a larger cam-
paign leading up to the Making Strides 
Against Breast Cancer walk Oct. 22.
JoAnn Alarid, a four-year survivor of 
breast cancer and community involve-ment chair for the event, purchased her own pink cart last year while fundrais-ing for her walk team, the Twinkling Ta-Tas. 
“We’ve got to bring our trash out, so 
why not make it look pretty?” she said. 
Alarid said Gainesville will be the 
first city in Florida to offer the pink carts. 
Other municipalities across the Unit-
ed States have their own pink cart cam-paigns as well as online programs such as thepinkcart.com, which works in col-laboration with the American Cancer Society to distribute carts to individual households that request them. 
Gainesville residents who want to 
order a pink trash cart can call the city solid waste division at 352-334-2330. 
There is no provision for non-munic-
ipal pink cart pickup, but county resi-dents can call Alachua County Waste Management at 352-338-3233 to request pickup. TRASH  from page 1

Anyone interested in learn-
ing about on-campus comput-
ing resources will have an op-portunity to do so Thursday.
The High-Performance Com-
puting Center’s Research Com-puting Day will be held from 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Thursday in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.  
Those people already using the computing center’s resources also can offer feedback at the event, said Charles Taylor, the center’s associate director.
“We want them to let us 
know what they need, what we are doing right and what we are doing wrong,” Taylor said.
Employees will also discuss 
computing-related programs.
One proposed topic of dis-
cussion is a look into a program created by UF’s new Chief In-formation Officer, Elias G. El-dayrie.
The Matching Program gives 
groups that buy services from the research center a free service or product for each one that is purchased at a matched price.
Taylor said this program, 
which is funded by the Division of Sponsored Research and the UF vice president’s office, will improve the ability of research groups to participate in comput-er-based research.
“When a research group buys 
a service, we will match the cost of it on a dollar-per-dollar basis with additional resources,” Tay-lor said. “Think of it as a buy-one, get-one free.”
A newly implemented Web-
based research system, the cen-ter’s storage capabilities and previous research projects will also will be discussed.Computing session

He groomed Muschamp and taught his 
protégé much of what he knows about be-
ing a head coach, from coaching philosophy to program management.
“Philosophically, we are on the same 
page about what we want to be defensively and from an identity standpoint,” Mus-champ said. “He does a great job of man-aging his program top to bottom from re-cruiting, his philosophy, offense, defense, special teams and I have great respect for that.” 
Muschamp’s ball-hawking, physical de-
fense, his smashmouth, run-first offense with a game-managing quarterback and even his recruiting style are all influenced by Saban.
As is his ability to handle the media; just 
read  his back-and-forth exchange on the Star Wars question again.
But one area  Muschamp still needs to 
learn from his master is his sideline de-meanor and ability to handle outside forc-es. 
Saban has always been intense, but he 
has also been good at keeping an even-keel persona during games. 
That, combined with the other coaching 
traits already mentioned, has led to success as a coach.
Meanwhile, Muschamp wears his emo-
tions on his sleeves and has said he won’t change for anybody. Plenty of his players said they feed off his intensity on the side-lines. 
But a belief of the Jedi is to remain emo-
tionally detached — something Muschamp has not shown he is capable of.
From his berating of officials during 
games, to his outspoken response to the NCAA suspending defensive lineman Shar -
rif Floyd, Muschamp has been emotionally involved.
He is Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars 
saga.
And just like Anakin, who was supposed 
to be the Chosen One but eventually suc-cumbed to the Dark Side, these two traits could lead to Muschamp’s eventual down-fall. 
He has done a great job at Florida so far 
and has a promising career ahead of him, but to quote Yoda: “Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. Suffering leads to the Dark Side.”
I know you haven’t seen the third (well, 
sixth) installment of the Star Wars saga, coach, but here’s a spoiler alert: It doesn’t end well for the Dark Side.

After Omar Hunter recovered a fumble midway through the first quarter, Florida quarterback John Brantley hit tight end Gerald Chris -
tian on a 45-yard touchdown pass for the Gators’ first points of the game. 
MATT WATTS
Alligator Staff Writer
While Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps 
remained the focal point of the offense 
against Kentucky, the Gators did some-thing they had not done all season: go vertical.
After stalling on the first two drives of 
the game, the Gators’ offense took over in Wildcats territory midway through the first quarter thanks to a fumble by UK running back Josh Clemons. Quarterback John Brantley found tight end Gerald Christian with a perfectly thrown ball on the next play, hooking up for a 45-yard touchdown and the first points of the game. 
“To have a fumble recovery and flip 
the field real quick there with the verti-
cal pass to Gerald, I was very pleased with that,” Florida coach Will Mus-
champ said Saturday. 
Much has been made about the Gators’ 
downfield passing attack this season, and the touchdown to Christian was the quick-strike, over-the-top ball critics have been longing to see from Brantley.
Coming into Saturday’s game, only 
17 of Brantley’s 47 completions had been to wide receivers, and he completed just one pass longer than 5 yards past the line of scrimmage against Tennessee. 
But the offense came out firing Satur -
day, as Brantley went deep on the game’s first play to wide receiver Deonte Thomp-Brantley, Gators display added dimension against Kentucky
� BOTH WEAR NON-CONTACT JERSEYS 
TO PREVENT INJURY.

Coach Will Muschamp is doing everything he 
can to keep Florida’s two most important playmak-
ers healthy . 
The senior running back duo of Chris Rainey 
and Jeff Demps has combined for 1,015 yards from scrimmage this season and has, at times, carried an offense that struggled to generate a downfield pass-ing attack. 
Rainey leads the team with 74 touches through 
four games, while Demps is second with 43. Rainey is on pace for 222 regular-season touches, which would more than double his previous season-high of 99. Demps would record 129 combined carries and catches if he continues at the current rate, which would surpass his career-best mark of 110. Muschamp said the backs have handled the in-
creased workload well to this point in the year. He and his staff are looking to counteract the negative effects of Demps and Rainey’s immense involve-ment by limiting the number of hits they take in practice. Each wears a non-contact jersey for the majority of the week, keeping them fresh for game action. 
“Those are two of our better playmakers, so 
they’re going to touch the ball,” Muschamp said. “We’re going to do what we need to do to win the game.”
Although Muschamp doesn’t intend to reduce 
the workload for Rainey and Demps, he could ex-periment with where and how they get their touch-es. He mentioned lining up the backs out wide or in the slot, perhaps to run a vertical route against a slower linebacker. 
“The different touches we get them could be 
different,” Muschamp said. “Not as conventional, maybe, as we’ve seen thus far.”Demps, Rainey limited in practice
Will Muschamp isn’t a big 
“Star Wars” fan, so for -
give him for being unfa-
miliar with the term “padawan” — a Jedi’s apprentice.
Florida’s coach admitted to 
only watching Episodes IV and V of George Lucas’ epic, so he was a bit confused when asked Mon-day, in “Star Wars” terms, about his relationship with Alabama coach Nick Saban.
Reporter: “You kind of have a 
master vs. padawan thing going on between you and Nick.”
Muschamp: “What’s a 
padawan? … I don’t know what a padawan is. You didn’t call me a bad name, did you? I don’t speak French, either.”N o , 
coach, you w e r e n ’ t called a bad name. But the q u e s t i o n did raise an inter -
esting analogy. 
Saban is the Obi-Wan Kenobi 
to Muschamp’s Anakin Skywalk-er.
Saban gave Muschamp his first 
big-time gig when he hired him at LSU in 2001, and then promoted him to defensive coordinator the following season. The Force is strong with

  After gambling with their back 
line all season long, the Gators’ 
streak of good luck ended after only one weekend of Southeastern Con-ference play.
  Though No. 6 Florida (8-3, 1-1 
SEC) had turnover problems in losses to top-10 ranked UCLA and Florida State, it had not been held immediately accountable until three giveaways helped open a 3-0 lead for No. 12 Tennessee on Sunday.
  “The way we play is pretty high-
risk,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “We have had some of these mistakes during the year so far and (had) not gotten punished for them. Tennes-see just did a good job of punishing us and that’s a really good lesson for us to learn.”
  Instead of leaving the standard 
four defenders along the back line, the Gators often keep just two to shield the goalie. Burleigh said she puts a lot of conﬁ  dence in her pair of fullbacks to handle the ball and keep possession.
  This method can work to perfec-
tion when UF maintains pressure at the other team’s end — as a seven-goal outburst on Sept. 18 against Kansas proved — but turnovers and missed assignments can quickly leave the keeper on an island.
  “There’s things we can do in 
practice,” Burleigh said of reducing mistakes. “We’ve got to be a little bit sharper, maybe minimize unneces-sary back passes. We don’t mind playing backwards when we just want to keep possession of the ball, but when we have the opportunity to go forward and play in the other team’s half, particularly early in the game, we need to do that.”
  After Georgia gave Florida ﬁ  ts 
in UF’s 1-0 win Friday, the Gators entered Knoxville, Tenn., with a chance to make an impact on the SEC East leaderboard and go up at least a game on every other team in the division.
  With the 4-2 loss, though, Florida 
failed to claim its ﬁ  rst victory at Ten-nessee in 12 years, and suffered its earliest league defeat since 2007 — when the squad exited its ﬁ  rst week-end of SEC play with a 0-2 record.
  During that season, the Gators re-
bounded from their miserable debut with nine straight conference wins 
en route to an SEC 
Championship. While Burleigh said there are no easy league games — especially on the road — the squad has no need to push the panic button after one 
loss.
  “We’re still going to play the way 
we play, but we just have to mini-mize our own errors,” she said. “We can’t afford to get ourselves in a hole like that. I credit our team for the mental and physical effort to come back, but in certain situations you’re not going to be able to come back when you do that.
“This was one of them; we had 
too little too late.”

  Parity is what makes sports interesting, pop-
ular and unpredictable.
A  ccording to UF volleyball coach Mary Wise, 
it is also the reason her team lost three games in 
the ﬁ  rst month of the 2011 season.
  “It is great for the game,” she said. “Not 
great for the coaches. Not great for their mental health.”
  After a 2010 in which the Gators’ only regu-
lar-season loss was to eventual national cham-pion Penn State, Florida has been battle-tested early. 
Wise’s team has already played as many 
ﬁ  ve-set matches as it did in all of 2010. A year ago, the Gators were 4-0 in said matches, but this season they are 1-3.
  “The 3-0 sweeps, they’re just not going to 
happen,” Wise said.
  UF’s coach of 21 years credits the emergence 
of balanced competition to a couple of factors.
  Since 2008, NCAA volleyball has operated 
off best-of-ﬁ  ve games with ﬁ  rst-to-25 point scoring.  The 1999 abolition of side-out scoring was another change intended to make games quicker and more even.
  “There’s not a lot of room for error here,” 
Wise said.
  But without an uprising of talent, the rules 
would not have made a difference. 
Wise said more premier female athletes are playing volleyball than ever before, leading to surprising turns such as this past weekend when No. 1 California was defeated by UCLA and USC.
  “These tournaments that we go to in the 
spring to recruit are played in these convention centers. There could be 100 courts,” Wise said. “You’re seeing so many better athletes play the game at a higher level. It used to be we were all recruiting the exact same players. Now there’s more talent throughout the country.”
  Detractions can be made to Wise’s argu-
ment. While the NCAA volleyball tournament has seen fresh faces over the last four years, it has been won each time by Penn State. Of the 30 NCAA titles that have been won in women’s volleyball, 18 have been by either Penn State or a team currently in the Pac-12.
  And this isn’t the ﬁ  rst time Florida has 
opened a season against tough competition. At this time last year, the Gators had faced seven AVCA Top-25 squads — compared to ﬁ  ve this year.
  Now the conference slate also looks as tough 
as ever for a Gators team that has won 19 of the last 20 Southeastern Conference titles. Florida’s loss Sunday to Tennessee snapped a 24-game conference winning streak.
  “Whether you’re in the SEC or the Big 10 or 
the Pac-12, there’s just no easy W’s on the list,” Wise said. 
“The game has evolved so differently be-
cause every team has a great point scorer.”  UF struggling early on due to

UF volleyball coachSOCCERInjury update: Muschamp said 
every UF player with the exception 
of junior cornerback Jeremy Brown would be healthy enough to practice Monday. 
Brown continues to nurse the 
knee injury that has kept him out of each of Florida’s first four games. 
Sophomore wide receiver Andre 
Debose and sophomore tight end Jordan Reed both missed Saturday’s game with undisclosed injuries.Reed’s ailment was classified as a lower body issue, and his return is expected to bolster the Gators’ down-field passing attack. 
“He’s a guy that can stretch the 
field,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s a guy that blocks well at the 
point of attack, but he’s also a guy that you’ve got to account for in the pass game. He’s an accomplished re-ceiver.”
Howard receives honor: Senior 
defensive tackle Jaye Howard was named the Southeastern Conference Defensive Lineman of the Week for the second time Monday . 
Howard had three tackles, a pass 
breakup and a fumble recovery that he returned for a touchdown against Kentucky. He now has 12 tackles and 1.5 sacks this season. 
Etc.: Sophomore Sharrif Floyd has 
played every position on Florida’s de-fensive line this season and said he’s most effective at end in either a 3-4 or 4-3 defense. Floyd was originally a defensive tackle but needed only to start “eating right” to transition outside. ... Muschamp named sopho-more Kyle Koehne the winner of the team’s Scrap Iron award, which goes to the week’s best offensive lineman.
Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alliga-
tor.org.son, who was streaking down 
the left sideline. The pass was incomplete, but it set the tone for an evening in which Brant-ley looked downfield more of-ten than not. 
Demps and Rainey entered 
the game as the team’s leading receivers, but Brantley com-pleted just one pass to a run-ning back in the first half, and that was a 2-yarder to Demps. Brantley finished 8 of 14 for 115 yards and one touchdown, deceiving numbers consider -
ing the running game again led the offense, and he didn’t play much of the second half. 
Brantley’s eyes were down-
field all game, and just two of his passes went for less than 10 yards — something he will likely be forced to do again this Saturday when Alabama and its vaunted defense comes to The Swamp.
“You have to be multiple 
when you play Alabama, you can’t be one-dimensional with what you do,” Muschamp said Monday. 
Muschamp said he is confi-
dent in Brantley and the wide receiving corps should the of-fense need to lean on the pass-ing attack against the Crimson Tide and in the future. He said the doubt resonates from much of Florida’s offense coming on the ground, a byproduct of holding large leads at halftime in each of the first four games. 
“John is going to be able to 
throw the football,” Muschamp said. “I’m very pleased with his progress, what we’ve done in the throwing game and what we’ve asked our football team to do on tape so far on Saturday. What I see in practice is a very productive passing attack.”
Brantley said he’s still a bit 
sore from taking two hard hits against Kentucky, but he said he will be fine for Saturday’s game and has “all the trust in the world” in his receivers.
“Any time we get to throw 
the ball downfield, we will,” he said. 
“We’re just going to take 
what the defense gives us and try to protect up front.”
