◗ UF quarterback John 
Brantley will be asked to 
take over for Heisman 
Trophy winner Tim Tebow this season. Brantley 
makes his first start 
against Miami (Ohio) on Saturday at noon.
Life After a
LegendJohn Brantley was asked this pre-
season if he had ever been inter-viewed without hearing the name “Tebow.”
  He laughed, saying he didn’t mind 
talking about him, about the pressures of replacing a two-time national cham-pion. Instead, Brantley shifted the con-
versation to the benefits of watching 
from the sidelines.
  “I’ve [gotten] to learn from one of 
the best quarterbacks that will ever play,” he said.
  Brantley learned how to handle him-
self, how everyone on the field looks at the quarterback to lead, how everyone off the field looks at the quarterback to slip up.  But some things can’t be learned 
from watching Tim Tebow. Tebow knows how to be a legend, not how to replace one. 
  The Gators have let fans know this 
is “Johnny B’s” team. Receivers said they’ve never played with a more ac-curate passer. Meyer said he’s enjoyed 
watching the junior become a leader. 
And, after three years of riding shotgun with Tebow, Brantley feels confident.
  “I can’t wait for Saturday to come,” 
he said. “I wouldn’t mind [throw-ing the ball deep early] just to get the nerves out. With the adrenaline pump-ing, I might be able to throw it through the stadium.”
  Brantley has talked with plenty of 
former Gators quarterbacks in prepa-ration for this season: Leak, Shane 
Matthews, high school coach Kerwin 
Bell and his own father, John Brantley III. 
  None of them can truly warn 
Brantley of the challenges he faces this 
season, however. Few people know 
how to replace a player widely consid-ered the best in school history.
  But some do. And those players 
know first-hand how to succeed when fans are still wearing your predeces-sor’s jersey.
  Just Start the Car and Steer
  When Danny Kanell became FSU’s 
starting quarterback in 1994, he felt a new standard had been set. The year prior, Charlie Ward led the Seminoles to their first national championship 
and became the first player in school 
history to win the Heisman.
  If FSU did not win another national 
championship, Kanell thought, the whole season would be a letdown.
  During a preseason practice, of-
fensive coordinator Mark Richt pulled him aside.
  “You’ve been given the keys to the 
Bentley ,” Richt told him. “You have so much talent around you. All you have to do is learn to use those guys. They 
want to keep the pressure off of you.”
  The Seminoles’ defense featured fu-
ture NFL Pro Bowl selections Derrick 
Brooks and Peter Boulware, and mem-bers of the unit told Kanell they had his back, regardless of how he played. 
  Kanell felt his teammates rallied 
around him more than Ward because they knew how long a shadow Ward cast after 1993. The sentiment did not extend to people outside the program, though.
  “In games when I threw a couple of 
picks, it seemed like everybody wanted me out,” Kanell said. “I kept hearing that FSU needed the next Charlie Ward 
and that I wasn’t going to be good 
enough. That’s tough.”
  Kanell was booed off the field in 
November of that year when FSU fell behind 24-3 at halftime against UF.   But he passed for 349 yards in the second half, leading the Seminoles to what was, at the time, the greatest fourth-quarter comeback in NCAA history. The “Choke at Doak” ended in a 31-31 tie — one of the most painful results in UF history.
  Take Doubts Personally
  Flipping through a magazine in 
the spring of 1998, Tee Martin learned Tennessee was going to win just six games that fall, his first season as the team’s starter.
  The Volunteers’s offense was los-
ing No. 1 overall draft pick Peyton Manning, the school-record holder in career passing yards and touchdowns.
  Martin refused to forget that pre-
season prediction. Not that coach Phillip Fulmer would let him.
  Tennessee practiced in plain, white 
helmets in the spring, and Fulmer told 
his players they would have to earn 
the signature T’s typically found on the sides of their heads. Six-win teams de-served to look ugly.
  Seeing the disrespect Martin re-
ceived following Manning’s departure, the team embodied the new quarter-back’s pissed-off attitude.
  “People didn’t know how much tal-
ent we had,” Martin said. “We knew we could be just as good without Peyton, and we played with a chip on our shoulder.”
  With Martin under center, Tennessee 
finished the regular season undefeated. Still, Martin told himself that nobody believed the Volunteers could win the national title, that he would never re-
ally be respected.
  In the Fiesta Bowl, Martin led 
Tennessee to a 23-16 win over FSU, 
throwing a pair of touchdowns to cap a 13-0 season, a feat Manning never ac-complished.
  “Every week we had something to 
prove,” he said. “And when we won the championship, we felt like we fi-nally proved to the world how good we were.”
  Don’t Stress, Have Fun
  The lasting image of Doug Flutie’s 
career at Boston College is a 48-yard Hail Mary to stun Miami during Thanksgiving weekend in 1984. But Shawn Halloran, Flutie’s backup, re-
members a different aspect. 
  “He made everyone in the program 
compete,” Halloran said. “Everything 
was a game. We were always hav-ing competitions. In the weight room, while watching film, it didn’t matter. We had fun.”
  Halloran knew replacing Flutie was 
impossible. But Halloran and the rest of 
the team honored their former quarter-
back by continuing old competitions.
  During warm-ups, Halloran played 
the “Dart Drill” with backups just like Flutie had with him. Before his backup threw, Halloran pointed to a body part and told the quarterback to hit it. 
  Hit the right spot, you get a point.   Despite following the most famous 
player in school history , Halloran never felt pressure. Before college, he used to feel nervous in the minutes before kickoff. But he didn’t stress with the Eagles.
He was too busy playing games.    “There was a lot on my plate because 
I was coming in after Doug,” he said. 
“But those things were fun. Playing in 
the Kickoff Classic on TV the year after he left? We wouldn’t have done that if it weren’t for Doug.”
  Be Yourself
  Fun or not, Boston College posted 
a 4-8 record in 1985. Halloran said the team still had not adjusted to life af-ter Flutie. The new quarterback was a pocket passer, but the Eagles continued 
to run plays requiring him to scramble. 
  Kanell was also charged with replac-
ing an unconventional quarterback. 
After watching Ward break defenses with exciting runs and deep passes the year before, Kanell tried to score touch-downs on every play in the 1994 season opener. 
  Ward, who was on the sidelines 
for the game, pulled Kanell aside and told him to make short passes. Fans remember big plays, Ward said, but those come easy if you complete simple throws first.
  Martin faced the opposite chal-
lenge. But he said being a dual-threat quarterback, as opposed to a poor 
man’s Peyton Manning, was the key to 
his success. Teams did not know how to prepare for a scrambling Tennessee quarterback.
  In all cases, teams were most suc-
cessful when adjusting plays to fit their new passers. And Florida is making an effort to do the same. 
  Meyer said the offense will look 
similar to the 2006 version led by Leak. And the team has practiced under-cen-ter formations for more than a year to prepare for Brantley’s ascension.
  And Brantley has prepared by not 
being Tim Tebow, no matter how much he hears about him.
  “What he’s done here in the last year 
has been exactly what we need to have 
happen,” Meyer said. “He’s grown up, 
he’s the leader of this team and he’s Johnny Brantley. That’s good enough for us.”

Running back Jeff Demps is looking to become the first UF player to rush for 1,000 
yards since Ciatrick Fason did in 2004.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
The departure of Tim Tebow has raised 
some doubts about the Gators’ offense.
With John Brantley coming into the season 
as a first-time starter with unproven receivers 
by his side, some are wondering how good this unit can be. 
The running backs will have a big part in 
answering that question when No. 4 Florida begins its season Saturday against underdog Miami (Ohio) at noon.
In 2009, Tebow led the team with 217 rush-
ing attempts — 118 more than starting run-
ning back Jeff Demps. This year the offense 
should look different with Brantley at the helm. As more of a pocket passer, he will rely on his arm rather than his legs.
“I’ll probably be touching that ball a little 
bit more now that Tim is gone,” Demps said. “We probably have to get that third-down-and-one or fourth-down-and-one call now.”
Short-yardage situations are just one of the 
duties that the backs will be more involved 
with this year.
Last season, the Gators scored a touch-
down when entering the redzone just 51 per -
cent of the time, partly because teams knew 
they would call a Tebow run more times than 
not. But with him gone, the coaches have in-
stalled the I-formation into this year’s offense to add another dynamic.
“We never used the ‘I’ last year,” running 
back Emmanuel Moody said. “It will help out a lot with just mixing up and putting the defense on its toes. They won’t really know how to line up with us when we go from the spread to the ‘I.’”
The constant runs up the middle with 
Tebow last season resulted in an average of 4.2 yards per carry, much less than those of Demps (7.5), Moody (6.5) and Mike Gillislee (8.6).The Gators will depend on their runners’ 
big-play ability to make up for the loss of wide 
receiver Riley Cooper and tight end Aaron 
Hernandez, who accounted for 55 percent of 
the team’s receiving yards last season
New running backs coach Stan Drayton 
has helped them with the transition to a more 
physical role. 
The backs have focused on developing 
a fearless mentality, keeping their pad level 
low and holding onto the ball to prepare for short-yardage situations.
“I feel like we always had [that mental-
ity],” Moody said.
Demps, Moody and Gillislee are all ex-
pected to receive playing time this season, each bringing a different skill set. 
Demps is the speedster that specializes in 
runs away from the interior of the line. Moody (5-foot-11, 215 pounds) is the biggest of the three and will be utilized more on inside runs. And Gillislee is a combination of the two.
Chris Rainey’s switch to wide receiver 
has opened the door for Gillislee to enter the backfield rotation.
The Gators’ depth is a positive, but it may 
also work against the running backs in their quest to become the first UF player to rack up 1,000 rushing yards since Ciatrick Fason  in 2004.
Or it could just mean that two of them will 
accomplish the feat.
“There’s a chance,” Moody said. “There’s 
definitely a chance.”Running backs expect 
expanded role in offense
“I’ll probably be touching that ball 
a little bit more now that Tim is 
gone. We probably have to get 
that third-down-and-one or fourth-
down-and-one call now.”

A UF building was evacuated Wednes-
day after smoke appeared on two if its floors.
Around 2 p.m. students, faculty and staff, some who came out of the building and some onlookers, stood and watched as fire trucks and University Police cars arrived.
Ronald Gonzalez, a Ph.D. candidate who 
works in Newell, said when he walked out of Room 409, he noticed smoke in the southwest corner of the building.
“It was kind of light, but I was able to see something,” Gonzalez said of the smoke. “...I couldn’t tell where it was coming from.”
The culprit was an elevator motor that 
burned out, causing the basement and the fourth floor to fill with smoke.
Six Gainesville Fire Rescue trucks respond-
ed to the scene, said Fire District Chief James Lovvorn. He said it took less than 40 minutes for officials to find where the smoke was com-ing from and put an end to it.

The Gator Nation has another reason to 
celebrate.
Gainesville was recently named the No. 
1 college town by Livability.com, a web-
site that rates American cities. On the site, 
Gainesville is called a “paradise for sports 
fans.” 
“I really do believe it’s all in our diver -
sity,” said Bob Woods, communications manager for the City of Gainesville. “We are doing things in a unique way , and that’s what separates us from the other college towns listed.”    
Gainesville was followed by Athens, 
Ga., home of the University of Georgia, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, N.C.
Woods said this ranking shouldn’t be 
anything new for Gainesville.“Quite frankly , as we see more and 
more of these awards, our secret is not so well-kept anymore,” he said.
In 1995, Money Magazine named 
Gainesville the No. 1 place to live in Amer -
ica. 
Since then, the city has received 29 such 
awards, according to the City of Gainesville website, including recognition as the No. 1 place to retire during an economic down-
turn by SmartMoney.com and the No. 11 
“gayest city” by The Advocate.
Israel Mendez, office manager for The 
Swamp Restaurant, which Livability named as one of Gainesville’s assets and places where after-game festivities take place, be-lieves that there is more behind Gainesville than just being a good college town. 
“I think it’s a great place not only to go 
to school to but also to raise a family,” Men-dez said. “It shows children you can have fun while you are getting an education.”Gainesville named top college town� VIOLENT CRIMES IN GAINESVILLE 
DECREASED 25 PERCENT.
By KATIE EMMETS
Alligator Staff Writer
For the first six months of 2010, crime is down 
in both Gainesville and Alachua County compared 
with crime statistics from the first half of 2009.
Violent crimes, which include rape, robbery and 
aggravated assault, are down 25 percent in the City 
of Gainesville and 34.4 percent in Alachua County.
The Gainesville Police Department reported that 
rape is down 22.6 percent, robberies are down 20.3 
percent and aggravated assault is down 27.3 per -
cent.
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office reported 
that rape is down 51.9 percent, robbery is down 47.1 percent and aggravated assault is down 31.1 percent.
Murder is the only crime in both agencies that 
has risen.
The number of murders in Gainesville has in-
creased from two in 2009 to three so far in 2010.
For the ASO, there have been 
three murders in 2010 compared to zero in 2009.
Both agencies have also seen a 
decrease in property crimes, which include bur -
glary, larceny and car theft.
For the city , burglary is down 14 percent, larceny 
is down 14.1 percent and car theft is down 21.9 per -
cent. Within the county, burglary is down 31.1 per -
cent, larceny is down 9.7 percent and vehicle theft is down 34.7 percent.
GPD spokeswoman Tscharna Senn attributed 
the dip in crime to several factors.
When Tony Jones became the police chief in 
2009, he placed administrative lieutenants on patrol, thereby increasing police presence on the street.
“Any time more officers are on the road, there is 
less crime,” Senn said.
Another reason for the decrease is community 
involvement.
“From the community, we get information about 
ongoing crimes and crimes that have already hap-pened,” she said. “With that we are able to redistrib-ute personnel to crime hotspots.”
ASO spokesman Art Forgey said he attributes 
the decrease in county crime to a fairly new com-munity-oriented policing tactic.
“They got to know where the problem areas 
are,” Forgey said. “They each have a vested interest in the community they work in.”City, county

� THE SHELTER REOPENED IN JUNE 
AFTER A 2009 FIRE DESTROYED IT.
By ANCA-ROBERTA VLASAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
After more than a year of displacement 
due to a fire, Peaceful Paths shelter for vic-
tims of domestic abuse welcomed the pub-lic to its open house Thursday.
An electrical fire  destroyed the facility 
in February 2009, forcing the center to op-erate out of temporary locations. 
Last June, the new building reopened to 
aid victims.  “The community was very instrumen-
tal in making sure we could get back into 
the building,”said Theresa Harrison, the 
executive director of Peaceful Paths.
Although the fire was difficult for 
Peaceful Paths, Harrison said she believes 
the new design of the house allows the 
center to improve the help it gives to those affected by domestic abuse. 
“The first office we purchased was ‘as 
is’ and there was little we could do to 
[make] changes,” Harrison said. “Here, we 
could design the office to meet safety and support needs for clients.”
The new additions include private wait-ing spaces, counseling rooms and meeting rooms for victims and families that are go-
ing through a crisis. 
According to Harrison, the community 
helped  fundraise, provide temporary lo-
cations when the building could not be 
used and provide materials and service for 
construction. 
Although Peaceful 
Paths was given finan-
cial support from the 
community, the center was not able to re-build debt-free. They have a $50,000 mort-gage that must be paid by July.
Supporters can help Peaceful Paths by buying a personalized brick, sponsoring a room or program. or donating items on the 
center’s wish list. 
The wish list items include toilet paper, 
cleaning supplies and gas cards so that 
Peaceful Paths can put the money that 
would have been spent on those items to-
ward their debt. 
For those who have questions or need 
assistance, Peaceful Paths has trained ad-vocates on staff 24 hours a day who can 
listen, give advice and provide assistance 
with the center’s services.

  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  
 
     NEW ORLEANS — An oil platform ex-
ploded and burned off the Louisiana coast 
Thursday, the second such disaster in the 
Gulf of Mexico in less than ﬁ  ve months. 
This time, the Coast Guard said there was no leak, and no one was killed.
The Coast Guard initially reported that 
an oil sheen a mile long and 100 feet wide 
had begun to spread from the site of the blast, about 200 miles west of the source of BP’s massive spill. 
But hours later, Coast Guard Cmdr. Cheri Ben-Iesau said crews were unable to ﬁ  nd any spill.
The company that owns the platform, 
Houston-based Mariner Energy, did not know what caused the explosion.
Mariner ofﬁ  cials said there were seven 
active production wells on the platform, and they were shut down shortly before the ﬁ  re broke out.
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the 
company told him the ﬁ  re began in 100 barrels of light oil condensate, but ofﬁ  -cials did not know yet what sparked the 
ﬂ  ames. Oil platform explodes, burns off coast of LouisianaNATIONALBy KATE FELDMAN

  The Campus Special, the com-
pany known for its $100 bill cou-
pon books, is delivering a new on-line food service to students at UF. 
  FoodCourt.com is a new web-
site where students can order food from local restaurants and have it delivered to their dorm or apart-
ment for free.
  Joe Jacobs, one of the found-
ing partners of Food Court, began 
planning the service in 2005 with Chau Nguyen. 
Jacobs and Nguyen spent two 
years building prototypes before beginning testing this summer and ﬁ  nally launching the site for the fall 2010 semester.
  Jacobs said many students were 
asking if they could use the coupon 
books to order online. When he looked into that option, he dis-covered that the other 
food delivery websites were charg-ing 75 cents per order. 
  “It shouldn’t be that much of a luxury to order online, so now 
we’re doing it for free,” he said.
  Through the Food Court web-
site, students can select restaurants 
based on menu, cost and business hours.
  In an attempt to create easy ac-
cessibility for all, the company has designed an application for Face-book that allows students to order directly from their proﬁ  les. Orders 
can also be made from www.Cam-
pusSpecial.com. 
  Kelly Johnson, a UF senior, said 
she saw advertisements for the Food Court website on all of the coupons distributed by the com-pany and decided to try it.
  “I was skeptical at ﬁ  rst, but now 
it’s just easy to do,” she said.  Website brings local food with no delivery charge

� STUDENTS WILL PLAY STARCRAFT.
By MICHAEL RAMIREZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students will study 21st century business 
skills in a 26th century war this semester.
“21st Century Skills in StarCraft” is an on-
line course offered by the College of Educa-
tion beginning this month. The class studies the real-time-strategy skills found in Blizzard 
Entertainment’s futuristic video game series 
“StarCraft” and how they can be applied in real-world business environments.
Nathaniel Poling, a third-year Ph.D. stu-
dent who created the course, said these video games require critical thinking, quick decision-making, resource management, micro-manag-ing and macro-managing. 
Poling said that in “StarCraft” and its re-
cently released sequel, “StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty,” players control and develop their 
base and units with the ultimate goal of over -
powering and defeating their opponents.
“You have to gather, analyze and synthe-
size many orders of data in a constantly chang-
ing environment,” he said.
Students will have to 
study concepts in the con-
text of the video game and 
use papers, diagrams and graphics to express 
how those concepts relate to the real world.There is no textbook for the course. The 
only requirements are a copy of the first or 
second video game, familiarity with the series and a computer with an off-campus Internet connection. 
Poling said the class is full, and there are 
no plans yet to offer this course in the future. Right now he is focusing on making sure this semester runs smoothly . 
“It’s very work intensive,” Poling said. “It’s 
more than just gameplay.”Course uses popular video game to teach business

When Olivia Barket walked out of 
her interview with Unite Party offi-
cials, she was happy to have taken her first step toward a seat in the Student Senate.
“I like it when things are in stu-
dents’ hands,” she said.
About 100 students came to the 
first day of Student Government slat-ing Thursday, where students inter -
ested in Senate positions interviewed with the three parties.
Members set up tables for the 
Unite Party, Student Alliance party and Progress Party on the second floor of the Reitz Union, where they interviewed students from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m.Unite Party spokesman Micah 
Lewis said he was impressed by the 
turnout.
“I was very excited by the caliber 
of the students that came out,” Lewis  said.
According to a count by Supervi-
sor of Elections Amanda Griffin, seven students slated with Student Alliance, eight with the Progress Party and 74 
with the Unite Party. Eleven were un-
decided.
Yevgen Sautin, communications 
director for the Student Alliance party , said the majority of students are fresh-men looking to get involved quickly.
“They see that SG is broken,” he 
said.
Slating interviews will continue 
Friday and Tuesday in Reitz Union Room 284 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.Search begins for 
fall SG candidates  The views expressed here are not necessarily those of the  Alligator .

Today’s question: Do you oppose off-shore drilling?Thursday’s question: Have you ever ridden a Segway?
94 TOTAL VOTES20% YES80% NOColumnist, friend stay together for pups
Although I’ve never been married or had any biologi-
cal children (that I know of), I find myself in the pre-carious situation of “staying together for the kids.”
By “staying together,” I mean sustaining a friendship that 
expired almost as quickly as our lame attempt at dating.
And by “dating,” I mean a weekend of hormone-fueled 
blunders.
And by “kids,” I mean puppies.And by “puppies,” I mean mind-controlling robots who 
have taken over my life.
Skipping through our inevitable “divorce,” we both found 
ourselves as simultaenous but separate parents.
And by “parents,” I mean slaves to our puppies.Once we scheduled our “kids’” first play date, things sort 
of patched themselves up.
The resentment, humiliation and denial of our past mis-
takes were wagged away by the tails of our four-legged chil-dren. 
Soon we began to rely on each other to aid in the rearing 
of our children.
Puppy-sitting became a summer staple. During day trips 
and weekend getaways, we relied on each other to look after our brood. 
A very weird, but functional, joint-custody system was 
set up where I would get them every other weekend. We did everything short of establishing a court-ordered custody schedule; we even worked out a child-support plan that kept us regularly treating each other to dinner.
Both pups became familiarized with each other, almost 
like siblings who occasionally make out and lick each other’s privates.
Not only were they getting along, but so were we as par -
ents. We did everything our dogs did. Well, except lick each other’s privates.
After a while, the parents, in their attempt to stay together 
for the kids, established a routine. Keys were exchanged. Rules agreed upon. Dual-parenting was in full swing. Disciplining the dogs became 
easier as they got used to having 
two parents. Toys, treats, food and 
parents became shared property to our spoiled kids.
Even now that school has start-
ed, our system is still loosely in place. Our puppies still lick each other, and we still don’t.
This whole process has taught 
me a few valuable things.
Nothing will keep two puppies from destroying flip-
flops. Lint and toy stuffing will always be a food group. And no matter how many walks puppies go on, there will always be accidents.
And by “accidents,” I mean a few catastrophic events re-
sulting in three new comforters.
Being friendly with an ex can be a nurturing experience. 
Even though the circumstances were defined by our puppies’ needs for proper socializing, we worked out our differences.
A relationship was salvaged.From the oblivion of a failed relationship came a quasi-
family that, every way you look at it, stuck together for the kids.
I’m not saying we’ll be moving in together anytime soon; 
and, no, wedding bells won’t be ringing in the near future. But for now, this relationship works.
Although I can’t vouch for human children -- as I’ve nev-
er raised any myself -- I can attest for two puppies for whom 
having more than one home seems to be working just fine.
Sure, they get a little disoriented when trying to find the 
front door at two different apartments, but let’s be honest: 
Who hasn’t drunkenly stumbled home to find that the door you’re knocking on is not in fact yours?

letters@alligator.orgThis is the time of the year when pool parties become 
priorities and Club West slowly starts to return to its normal quiet madness.
It’s also the time of year when Gator football begins, and 
Saturdays become synonymous with tailgating and beer-can-bombing campus a la Johnny Appleseed with apple trees. So, before your memory evades you and you forget what day of the week it is, we leave you with a we’re-sur -
prised-you-took-a-break-from-pre-gaming-long-enough-to-read-this edition of...
Darts & Laurels
And speaking of surprise, we had quite a shock this 
week when we found out one of our own had become a 
linebacker for the Gators. We’re positive it’s the first — and last — time in history that an Alligator staffer also gets to strap on the orange and blue and run through that tunnel 
most people only see from the stands. 
We’re positively bursting with pride (we like to think 
we put so much pressure on him that he harnessed his 
inner rage and charged his way right onto the field with deadlines in mind), so we’re gripping those laces and hurl-ing a football-shaped LAUREL at a certain former section 
editor and staff writer of ours. You’ll be sorely missed. 
And while we’re on the subject of missing people, 
it’s hard to start football season without thinking of Tim 
Tebow, who leaves a gaping hole in our hearts and forces 
us to retire our No. 15 jerseys a little earlier than we’d have liked.
Still, we’re proud of our little Timmy, so we’re whip-
ping out the eye black and writing a big old LAUREL to the 
one and only Tim Tebow.
Proving people wrong has been a hot topic of conversa-
tion recently, especially among offshore drilling advocates with their “Drill, baby, drill!” chants becoming “Drill, baby, drill?”
Even with Deepwater Horizon spewing hundreds 
of millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and decimating marine life, it amazed us how quickly people changed their minds to again support offshore drilling as soon as British Petroleum stopped the leak. 
Well, another oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on 
Thursday. 
We’re not chemistry majors — we don’t know how to 
build stuff that requires more know-how than a Jenga tow-er — but we don’t think it should be the hardest thing to, 
you know, stop blowing up oil rigs. 
Although the Coast Guard said there’s no visible sheen 
of oil and there’s no sign this will turn into another public-
relations and ecological disaster, we’re drenching offshore-
drilling advocates with a 200-million-gallon-bird-soaking DART.
We know we can’t drench anyone with a dart, but that’s 
just how mad we are. 
But some things make us happy.
 Canceled classes, the return of Pumpkin Spice Lattes 
(although not when it’s 95 degrees outside — we’re so con-
fused as to what season it is) and cupcakes. Cupcakes al-ways make us happy.
But when an independent candidate, who was likely to 
split the vote for governor and give the governor’s man-sion to a millionaire trying to buy that very house, drops out – well, that’s just like candy.
So, Lawton Chiles III, we’re boisterously throwing a 
We’re-So-Glad-You-Admitted-You-Are-Unsuccessful-Be-cause-Now-We-Might-Have-A-Chance-To-Vote-A-Qual-ified-Person-Into-Our-Governor’s-Mansion LAUREL to 
you.
If you read this far, we’re proud. So very proud. You can skip to the crossword puzzle now.FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
Constitution upholds separation 
of church and state; column gets founding of America wrong
Where do I even begin, Bryan? 
I could go on about the topic of 
your column for days, but instead, I will dissect your whole argument in one swift motion. 
Here’s an excerpt from a docu-
ment called the Constitution, which, 
unlike the document you  cited in 
your column (the Declaration of In-dependence), actually has relevance 
in a court of law.
“Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of re-
ligion, or prohibiting the free exer -
cise thereof...” the U.S. Constitution states.
No, the words “separation of 
church and state” are not explicitly 
mentioned, but the concept is im-
plied. 
That line from the Constitution  
guarantees the freedom to practice 
whatever religion you want, in-cluding the thousand belief systems 
that don’t coincide with the one to 
which you subscribe.  
It also means the government is 
prohibited from promoting or en-forcing any single religious or spiri-
tual belief. 
In other words, preferential 
treatment to any religious doctrine 
by any law in this country is forbid-
den by the  Constitution.
And Bryan, we can all think for 
ourselves. 
I certainly hope you don’t need 
the ambiguous words of a “su-preme” deity to realize slavery is  unethical and that discrimination is 
a disgusting act.
That is the beauty of a democrat-
ic society. 
The power of the government 
is provided by the “consent of the governed.” 
To speak of any divine relevance 
in this sense is unconstitutional.

SCOREBOARD POLL QUESTION UF FOOTBALL
  It all starts Saturday. 
  The ﬁ  ercest battle in all the land 
kicks off, and fans everywhere get a new, long season to marvel at the 
competitive excellence of its partici-
pants. 
  The glory of winning is great, but 
pride is the true motivating factor. 
  Guys want to be like them, and 
chicks want to be with them. 
  It all starts Saturday — the 2010 
edition of the alligatorSports Brand Picks Column. 
  Last year, a new tradition was 
born when we asked some of the oth-
er Gators beat writers to pick games 
against us. Not that it mattered, as the crown went to Alligator writer Kyle 
Maistri. 
  Some familiar names are back this 
time around, and we also want to 
welcome the newbies to the fray. 
  Our ﬁ  rst debated game of the year 
is Boise St.-Virginia Tech. Enjoy. 
Virginia Tech will scoff at the 1.5 
free points it’s getting because:
  Tyler Jett is all about being trendy 
in the wrong way.
  Between his robot t-shirts that no 
one understands and his pseudo-
gangster vocabulary, he’s always 
jumping on the wrong bandwagon, 
and that’s the same thing he’s doing 
here.
  The Broncos are the sexy underdog 
pick to reach the BCS Championship, but that’ll be over after this weekend.
  Virginia Tech running back Ryan 
Williams is going to be unstop-
pable this season, and the Broncos’ 
shaky defense is no match for him. I watched Williams go into Beast Mode 
against my beloved East Carolina last 
season, and he did the same thing to 
just about everyone else, gaining 100 
yards in 10 of 13 games.
  Williams is going to lower his pads 
and plow right through Boise State in

touchdown passes will John Brantley throw against Miami (Ohio)?

Coach Mary Wise and the Gators are back in Gainesville after beating two top-ten 
teams to start the season.
  By MATT RUBIN
 Alligator Writer
   
 Last weekend the Gators traveled to Omaha, 
Neb., and defeated Nebraska in front of a hostile 
road crowd.
  This weekend, No. 6 Florida will return to 
Gainesville to host the Campus USA Credit Union 
Invitational to open its home schedule.
  “It makes me a lot more conﬁ  dent,” freshman 
Chanel Brown said. “Especially to play with that 
kind of crowd in your season opener, I think it helped all of us realize how excited we are to come back to the [O’Connell Center]. We’re ready to play 
in front of Gator Nation and see a lot of orange and blue.”
  Florida will start the event 
with a doubleheader today in the O’Connell Center, taking on Alba-ny at 12:30 p.m. and then Bowling Green at 7:30 p.m. On Saturday , 
the UF will face No. 15 Colorado State at 4 p.m.
  “Traditionally the new matches on Fridays 
aren’t a great draw, but I’m giving permission to anybody to skip work to come out,” coach Mary Wise said. “We’ve had great crowds surrounding 
the football game. That is not done on accident.”
  Regardless of how many fans show up at the 
matches, the players seem to have mutual feelings 
about playing in front of the home crowd for the ﬁ  rst time this season.
  “We’re really excited,” junior Kelly Murphy 
said. “It’s always fun to play at home and we al-ways have a great crowd.”
  Murphy was named the Sports Imports/Ameri-
can Volleyball Coaches Association Division I Na-tional Player of the Week after recording the 16th triple-double of her career against Nebraska.
  Her 20 kills, 23 assists and 10 digs helped the   UF returns 
home to host

 After an undefeated start, the Gators 
know they have a good team with potential 
to do a lot of damage this season.
  “I really like this team a lot,” Florida 
coach Becky Burleigh said. “We got some 
great contributions from some newcomers, 
we’ve got some great contributions from some returners, and I think that we’re head-ed in the right direction.”  As No. 7 UF (4-0) prepares for its only 
home game of the month against Jackson-ville (2-2), it knows how important it is to 
get a solid victory before embarking on a ﬁ  ve-game road trip, which includes stops at 
No. 5 FSU and No. 1 North Carolina.
  “It’s huge (to head into the road trip with 
a win),” captain McKenzie Barney said. “We always take pride in playing at home and winning on our home ﬁ  eld, so we’re deﬁ  nitely looking for another win.”
  Fresh off a second-straight SEC Offen-
sive Player of the Week award, Barney has given UF a huge boost. She is in top form and feels conﬁ  dent going into the Jackson-ville game. Gators look for win before tough road tripSEE VOLLEY, PAGE 15

 Wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. is suspended for at least Sat-
urday’s game against Miami (Ohio) because of his DUI arrest in June, 
according to coach Urban Meyer. However, Meyer would not say if freshmen Matt Elam and Solomon Patton, who were both arrested for possession of alcohol under the age of 21, will be in uniform.FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15
the same head-and-shoulders-first fashion that Tyler has to 
use to cram his Gumby-like frame into his Camry, and he’ll 
look much less ridiculous doing it.
— MIKE McCALL
Boise State will cover the (-1.5-point) spread because:Quarterback Kellen Moore wants to. Who cares that he’s 
facing Bud Foster’s vaunted defense? 
Moore threw for 39 touchdowns and just three intercep-
tions last year. And he still has his two favorite receivers, Austin Pettis and Titus Young. Moore has been starting 
since his freshman year, so it feels like he’s been around for -
ever, kind of like Mike McCall.
Look at that picture of McCall on page 16. That was tak-
en back in 2007, when the whole “Lloyd from Dumb and 
Dumber” look was in style.
Some time between getting rejected by drunken birthday 
girls in Tallahassee last weekend and getting taken higher at 
a Creed concert Wednesday night, McCall had time to think about college football. Then he decided to rewatch season 
four of The Wire for the 19th time (Watch out Bodie!).
Give up. Sports just aren’t your thing, Mike. 
— TYLER JETT
Now, on to the picks!
Representing alligatorSports and tied for first place for 
what is sure to be the only time this season is Mike “Fourth 
tour of duty” McCall, who is embarking on an unprecedent-ed fourth season of football coverage during his fifth year of school. Drink like a fifth-year, vomit like a freshman. That’s Mike’s motto!
Also representing the Alligator is newcomer Anthony 
“Shining like Starbury” Chiang, who rocked a $15 pair of flashy, orange cleats to pickup flag football Saturday. No word on the impending face tattoo, but if anyone knows the 
Chinese characters for “Bone Thug Bosses,” he’s listening. 
Our third Alligator football writer is Tyler “I would do 
anything for irony, but I won’t do that” Jett, who took ex-
ception to our own Mike McCall making a trip to Tampa 
for a Creed concert but has no problem rocking a fake un-
buttoned flannel t-shirt once every five days as part of his hipster shirt rotation.
Hitting cleanup in the alligatorSports lineup is return-
ing champ Kyle “I’m taking school so seriously in my fifth 
year that I actually bought a backpack” Maistri, who barely 
escaped an interview session after UF receiver Carl Moore mistakenly thought Kyle was calling him the most selfish 
player on the team.
From the Gainesville Sun, welcome back Ed “I get my 
nuts every day” Aschoff, whose declaration can only be 
taken as a homosexual rendition of Flo-Rida’s “Birthday.” 
Ed don’t want no nuts on his birthday, he want his nuts er -
ryday (erryday). 
One ass-whooping wasn’t enough for our next partici-
pant. That’s right, the Miami Herald’s Joe “I was on my 
heavy flow” Goodman, who previously vowed not to return 
after he felt we crossed the line with one of our insults last 
season. We promise to be gentle this year. Also, we hear 
pads with wings work the best. Our first new guest is Gatorbait.net’s Keith “Kim Kar -
dashian is a mess downstairs” Niebuhr, who made that 
proclamation during his in-depth analysis of the Kim look-
alike in Brandon Spikes’ sex tape, then regretted it upon learning his participation in this column would involve be-
ing insulted.
And also here for the very first time and rounding out 
our field of combatants is FightinGators.com’s Cody “Who’s laughing now?” Jones, who has a habit of fake laughing at 
his friends’ jokes. We’ll see who gets the last laugh when 
your secret Chatroulette session with Jason Heyward leaks 
this weekend. PICKS , from page 14
Even though Barney had a number 
of missed chances last week, she still 
knows what she has to do to lead the 
Gators to victory.
“I need to finish on my opportuni-
ties,” Barney said. “I need to be ac-
countable for what my job and position 
on the team is, and I also need to pump 
everyone up to dominate next game.”
Although they had some problems putting the ball in the net, the Gators 
played well against San Diego State’s 
defense and look to do the same against the Dolphins.
“The Jacksonville team is going to 
be another puzzle in terms of how we break down a very organized defense, which is something we see a lot,” Bur -
leigh said. “It’s a really equipped skill for our team to master, and hopefully 
we can build on our experience from 
last weekend and be able to do that against Jacksonville.”Gators face Dolphins tonight
SOCCER , from page 14Three matches on tap for Florida
Gators jump from their previous spot of 
No. 13 in the rankings and gave UF its first national player of the week since Murphy was given the same honor as a freshman in 2008.
“It’s really cool but I think a lot of it had 
to do with how the team played,” Murphy said. “I think if we hadn’t played so well, none of it would have been possible.”
Although fewer and fewer teams are 
putting doubleheaders on their schedules, Wise sees it as a way to get more matches in and allow the team to improve. She also says there is little concern of physical weari-
ness because the team is in great shape and 
it’s still early in the season. 
Between the three matches, the Colorado State contest appears to be the biggest chal-lenge of the weekend. 
In 2008, the Rams defeated the Gators in 
straight sets in the beginning of the season. However, the Gators returned the favor at 
the NCAA Champion-
ships, defeating the Rams 
in three straight.
Wise made it clear that 
the team is unconcerned with rankings, instead focusing on the match at hand.
“We’re most concerned with what we 
can do against Albany, a team that has been 
in the NCAA Tournament multiple times,” 
Wise said. “It’s not getting caught up on last weekend or next weekend, it’s all about this moment.”VOLLEY , from page 14  AC  TJ  KM  MM

Volleyball16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2010
I’ve blown plenty of time on 
low-grade entertainment, and I’m ready to tack another three-
and-a-half hours onto my lifelong tally this Saturday.
Florida players face tougher 
competition in practice than they 
will against Miami (Ohio), but I 
have to watch it and you’re go-ing to anyway, so let’s find the silver lining instead of complain-ing about another weak season 
opener.
You can make almost anything 
fun if you try hard enough. For 
me, this game is all about focusing 
on a few players I want to see, and 
hopefully that will keep things in-teresting for three quarters or so.
It’s like how I know “The 
Switch” is probably a terrible 
movie, but I’ll end up watching 
because Jennifer Aniston is in it.
So who are the Jens for Florida-
The Other Miami? 
Omarius Hines and Chris Rain-
ey.
Much like Aniston plays the same type of character in every movie, Urban Meyer wants to re-use two roles in his offense: those 
of Aaron Hernandez and Percy 
Harvin.
“Tight end” and “receiver” 
don’t really describe what those 
two did for the Gators, and that’s 
the point. They’re versatile play-makers who can be threats all across the field, and Meyer is hop-ing Hines and Rainey can fill those 
shoes this year.
Those position labels don’t ap-
ply to Hines and Rainey either, as 
both played at different spots last 
season.
Practices were closed this fall, 
so no one outside of the locker 
room really knows how their tran-sitions have gone, but the reviews 
from teammates have been glow-
ing.
Left guard Carl Johnson called 
Hines a “modern-day C.I.” in ref-
erence to Cornelius Ingram, one of 
the most freakish players Meyer has had at UF.H i n e s 
will be used like Hernan-
dez, at times 
playing as a traditional tight end, 
lining up at 
his natural position of receiver and 
handling the most unstoppable 
play in Florida history: the tight-
end shovel pass.
Most of what is said about 
Hines concerns his size. A chiseled 
6-foot, 219-pounder, his physique 
has earned the nickname “The Greek Goddess.”
“He’s too big for corners and 
he’s too fast for linebackers,” John-
son said. “He’s that hybrid player. 
It’s fun to watch him and see those little DBs try to attack someone that big and then see those line-
backers try so hard but not come 
close to catching him.”
Jordan Reed and Trey Burton — two players who came to Florida as quarterbacks — are also playing that position, and Reed looked to 
be the starter until he was injured, 
so there could be changes at the spot as the season wears on.
But for now, the job belongs to 
Hines, and I can’t wait to see what he does with it.
Rainey has to replace an even 
bigger name at the “Percy Posi-tion,” where he’ll get touches out 
of the backfield and in the passing 
game.
“He has to give us the home-
run shot, and he’s got the ability,” 
Meyer said. “There’s not really an 
offense that can function without a home-run hitter, and he’s No. 1 or 2 on our list.”
Rainey hit one out in last year’s 
season opener. He touched the ball once against Charleston Southern and was standing in the end zone 76 yards later.
There shouldn’t be any doubts 
about Rainey’s elusiveness (re-member that Cincinnati player he hurdled from the 3-yard line for a touchdown in the Sugar Bowl?) but he’ll have to be more consis-
tent now that he’s one of the key 
playmakers.
We won’t know if he’s ready for 
that after this weekend, but given 
running back Emmanuel Moody’s 
cliché-riddled description, Rainey shouldn’t have much trouble with the RedHawks.  
“He’s making plays left and 
right (in practice),” Moody said. “He’s taking them to the house sometimes, making people miss, making people look foolish and 
breaking ankles out there. One 
time he had a play on (linebacker) Jelani Jenkins, and Jelani didn’t even know where he was.
“Once he gets the ball in his 
hands, it’ll be electric.”
Let’s hope so. If Hines and 
Rainey don’t provide a jolt, Satur -
day won’t just be boring, it could 
be a sign that this season will be 
more of a box office flop than a blockbuster.
Hines, Rainey provide reasons for you to watch lopsided matchup
