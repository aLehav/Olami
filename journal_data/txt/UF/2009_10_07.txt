UF ADMINISTRATION
Research funding
ranks 19t
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
A rickety economy has not stopped UF
from spending about $584 million on sci-
ence and engineering research in the 2008
fiscal year, earning the university a spot
in the nation's top 20 in terms of research
funding.
Even still, UF looks a little stingy com-
pared to its spending the previous year.
According to the National Science Foun-
dation, UF's spending decreased by about
$9 million from the 2007 fiscal year.
UF is ranked 19th in the nation, accord-
ing to the foundation.
John "Row" Rogacki, director of the UF
Research and Engineering Education Facil-h in US
ity, credits the university's reputation for
the amount of funding it received.
"The university has a very strong repu-
tation, and we work very hard at what we
do, competing for and winning grants and
contracts," Rogacki said. "It really speaks
highly of our people."
Rogacki described the process to receive
funds as cutthroat, often weeding out good
ideas along the way.
"It's a competition," Rogacki said.
"There are more good ideas than there is
money to fund those good ideas."
Rogacki said REEF's current research
agenda includes computation energetics
and computation mechanics, studies that
focus on munition innovation.

A former UF engineering employee
was arrested Sept. 29 after police say he
molested a 9-year-old girl last year.
David Blankenship, 53, was arrested in
Washington County after a warrant was
issued from the state attorney's office, ac-
cording to a release.
On April 15, the victim came to Alachua
police and said Blankenship molested her
in 2008, though she was not able to give
them an exact date, according to the re-
lease.
The girl told police he entered her room,
touched her genitals under her clothes and
penetrated her with his fingers, accordingto a police report.
The report did not include the reason
Blankenship was in the girl's room.
Blankenship was charged with lewd
and lascivious molesta-
tion. His bail has been
posted at $100,000, ac-
C , cording to the release.
Blankenship worked
at UF as a photographer
in the College of Engi-
neering News and Pub-
Blankenship locations office from Sep-tember 1980 until July
2008, UF spokesman Steve Orlando said.
Orlando had no further comment on
the investigation.

Senators say farewell, welcome newly elected members
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Senate rocked to a new beat
Tuesday night when new senators
were sworn in and old senators said
goodbye.Progress Party Sen. Dave Sch-
neider, who represented Rawlings
Hall, left Senate with a bang. He
grabbed a guitar and two musicians
and sang a rendition of "Thank You
for Letting Me Be Myself Again" by
Sly and the Family Stone.
"Guys, as my last meeting, I fig-ured that making a speech would be
kind of another
Student brick in theGovernment wall, dust in the
wind," he said.
Schneider dedicated the song to
his party members and the senators
who voted in favor of the resolutionasking Aramark, UF's food provid-
er, to negotiate wage increases for
Immokalee tomato growers.
Orange & Blue Party Sen. Ben
Cavataro, who represented Hume
Hall, said he did not want to see the
band go.
"I wish they could stay for therest of the night so that they could
play people off the stage like the Os-
cars," Cavataro joked.
Cavataro offered advice to new
senators, saying they should be pro-
active and find their niche in Senate.

CORRECTION
It was reported in the Sept. 29
edition of the Alligator that Jo-
seph McCabe was a UF student
senator. While he still officially
held his seat until Tuesday night,
when his term ended, McCabe
withdrew from the university on
Sept. 14, according to the Office
of the University Registrar. The
registrar's office initially provid-
ed incorrect information, listing
McCabe as an enrolled student,
but confirmed Tuesday he had
withdrawn.
An employee in the Student
Government office said McCabe
was able to retain his seat be-
cause no one had notified the of-
fice of his withdrawal.

Fraternity hosts World Series of Spades for charity
* 28 PLAYERS COMPETED
FOR A $100 VISA GIFT
CERTIFICATE.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Reigning Champions won
the World Series on Tuesday
night.
Twenty-eight players sipped
on smoothies and sodas while
they competed in Phi
On Beta Sigma Frater-
CampuS nity Inc.'s World Se-
ries of Spades cards
tournament at Orange & Brew.
The World Series of Spades is
one of seven events Phi Beta Sig-
ma Inc. will host during its bian-
nual "Sigma Recess" week.
There is one event held every
the fall, and one will be held in
the spring, senior Jacquestephen
Carrenard said.
The competition was divided
into three rounds.
The first team to earn five
points won the game and moved
on to the next round.
As music thrummed in the
background, competitors played
through each game, only taking abreak while they waited for other
games to finish.
Fourteen teams of two com-peted, each giving itself a name
like The Lion King and The
Reigning Champions. The com-petitors were not allowed to talk
about the card game while they
were playing.
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
Calvin Smith and Tay Ford play against Brandon Thomas and Thaddeus Blue during a semifinal round of
the World Series of Spades tournament put on by Phi Beta Sigma Inc. inside Orange & Brew Tuesday."It's a pretty intense game
when it starts getting played,"
said senior Terrell Wilks, who
helped plan the event. "People
show a lot of emotion when you
can't talk like that."
The games got more and more
competitive as the tournament
carried into the final games.
During the championship
round, everyone gathered around
the last table to peer over the
players' shoulders.
This year's winners, senior Mi-
chael Wood and sophomore Pau-
la Irvin of the Reigning Champi-
ons team, won a $100 Visa gift
certificate.
The chapter will decide where
the money raised throughout the
week will be donated.
In the past, Phi Beta Sigma Inc.
has donated funds to the Ameri-
can Red Cross, The American
Cancer Society and schools in the
Alachua County area.
"Nothing's definite as of yet,
but these are places we are look-
ing into," Carrenard said.
Other events Phi Beta Sigma
Inc. will be hosting this week are
a three-on-three basketball tour-
nament, a free game night and a
free barbecue and tailgate.

CITY COMMISSION
Equal opportunity
director elected
By JIMMIE PAUL
Alligator Writer
The Gainesville City Commission elected a new Equal
Opportunity Committee director at its Tuesday meeting.
Cecil E. Howard, one of six candidates the commission
invited for an on-site interview, was selected unanimously.
"I felt relieved," Howard said. "I had never gone through
a grueling two-day interview."
Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan, the commissioners and char- i
ter officers interviewed the applicants.
"I was thoroughly impressed by all six candidates,"
Hanrahan said. "They have all been stellar."
Howard said he plans to move to Gainesville soon and
analyze the failures and successes of the previous director.
The Equal Opportunity Committee ensures equal access
to employment, housing and credit in Gainesville.
As a Seminole, Howard joked about being a Gators fan.
"Once a Seminole, always a Seminole," he said. "How-
ever, my son is looking into UF." Ana Goni-Lessan / Alligator Staff

Bourgie Burger
Burger King's makeover
too fancy for fast food
In an attempt to reign as fast food's king of the grill, Burg-
er King Corp. officials have announced plans to overhaul
its 12,000 restaurant locations.
The remodeled restaurants will feature a "sleek interior"
with "rotating red flame chandeliers" and "industrial-in-
spired corrugated metal and brick walls," according to an
article by the Associated Press.
The king of Burger King, CEO John Chidsey, said the
restaurant will feel much more "upscale," according to the
article.
About 60 locations have already been remodeled.
So, by the time the No. 2 burger restaurant chain in the
U.S. has finished remodeling its remaining 11,940 locations,
they'll likely be outdated.
We can't understand why fast food chains insist on mar-
keting their products as something other than fast food.
A McDonald's McCaf6 won't make anyone's McDesk job
any more McMarvelous.
Just like ordering a Whopper from a "brilliant TV-screen
menu" won't make our burgers any better.
So Burger King, please find another way to spend that
"whopping" $300,000 to $600,000 per restaurant. Perhaps
start with developing better menu items?
Or at least think of a better advertising campaign. That
king fella is getting creepy.
No Tiene Taco Bell
Miami man appar-ently wanted his
Taco Bell "fourth-
meal" so badly that he
thought it was worth a few
bullets.
After employees repeat-
edly told him he couldn't
place an order because the
restaurant was closed, the
man waited in the parking
lot and fired a gun at the
manager, according to an
Associated Press article.
Six rounds later, he
struck one employee in the
leg.
Unfortunately, investi-
gators have not found the
suspect, according to the
article.
So, what item on a Taco
Bell menu is worth open-
ing fire? The fire sauce?
A Crunchwrap Supreme?
Perhaps a MexiMelt?
We know how disap-
pointing it is to show up at
the University Avenue Taco
Bell, only to find that they're
out of beans, rice, chickenand every other menu item.
We also know what it's like
to then drive to the chain
restaurant's Archer Road
location, only to hear that
employees "just turned off
the machines that make the
food." (Ahem, we thought
hands made our food.)
But this is Gainesville,
a city that shuts down at 2
a.m. Miami, however, nev-
er sleeps.
Couldn't the Taco Bell
Terror have ventured to,
say, an authentic Mexican
restaurante?
This man is an example
of why people need to take
a deep breath and not flip
out when things go awry.
It's a taco. Get over it.
Everyone can be guilty
of overreacting, but waiting
until employees leave so
you can shoot them is not
the right answer to "Sorry,
we're closed."
Just imagine what would
have happened if they
messed up his order.

SG involvement doesn't stop at polls
hate to break it to everyone who got worked up overthe Student Government elections last week, but noth-
ing new happened.
Last semester, the exact same issues were argued.
Transparency, online voting, "I voted" stickers -heard
it all. And the same issues will be debated next semester.
Sure, there are slight twists. What will the majority
party call itself this year? What will Frank Bracco decide
to file a complaint about this time?
Let me share what I've learned after four and a half
years at UF, during much of which I was editing Alligator
stories about SG. Each party has really awesome people
who are in it for the right reasons. Each party also has
really shady people who get high off power and manipu-
late the system for their own motivations. And I really
don't believe that there are more of either type of people
on one side than the other.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The system is corrupt. But it's a cor-
rupt system that spends $14 million of your money, re-
gardless of the corruption level.
I'm not going to say that the 83 percent of students
who didn't vote in this semester's elections were irre-
sponsible. I completely get the apathy.
Despite knowing a lot about SG and how it works, I
was still extremely tempted to not vote in this semester's
election. I told a volunteer who was trying to give me a
sticker, "I know more about Student Government than I
can ever hope to forget."
And even though my SG-passionate best friend
dragged me to the polls, I still don't believe that election
day or the issues that get brought up in the preceding
weeks are the ones that actually affect students in their
day-to-day lives.
Don't get me wrong -I believe that the student paperHilary Lehman
Ietters@alligator orghas a duty to look into these issues,
and that the minority party should
continue bringing them up. It cre-
ates a checks and balances system
that's necessary in any type of dem-
ocratic government.
I just don't believe that voting
for a certain party in the election is
the way most students can best par-
ticipate in SG politics.
Do you think that food in the Reitz Union is over-
priced? SG officials have office hours, just like your pro-
fessors -stop by and express your concerns. Are half
the chairs in your lecture hall broken? Learn the name of
your college's representative and send him or her an e-
mail. Want to make sure your voice gets heard? Show up
at a Senate meeting. They're open to students.
It's interesting to me that the SG pundits who bemoan
lack of student involvement just before and after the elec-
tion always seem to disappear during the year.
If you really care about SG, don't vote and then com-
plain that the same party always wins or complain about
even having to vote because your party always wins.
Newsflash: It's true! The same party always wins! That
doesn't mean that you're never going to see the results
you want out of SG or that you can assume the party of
your choice will do everything it promised.
In the end, whatever party you voted for, your repre-
sentatives are students who should care about the same
things you care about. Being active during the year is a
more surefire way of getting what you want out of UF's
student political process than just casting one vote.

SG lacks student relevance
he reason students don't participate inStudent Government is that it fails to
make a step toward a greater society.
Apathy isn't the issue, relevance is.
Instead of turning the goals and image of
SG into something that reflects a common
measure of greatness, those who participate
insulate themselves in a fake world. In their
bubble, they are able to act out an illusion of
greatness. Like a collection of children play-
ing monopoly and imagining themselves to
be powerful realtors, they have redefined
what is prideful and fundamental while on-
lookers merely smile, halfheartedly wish they
had time for such things and move on with
the work of understanding the larger world
and their part in it.
As long as the goals of SG amount to pass-
ing pointless resolutions or throwing the best
Gator Growl ever, students will continue to let
the children play their game by themselves.
As a Democrat, I can say that there is
plenty of room for an SG party to champion
the causes of the defenseless, voiceless and
less fortunate. Campus organizations such
as Pride Student Union and Human Rights
Awareness struggle to extend civil rights pro-
tection to the vulnerable and abused.
Off campus, the Alachua County Coali-
tion for the Homeless and Hungry is taking
on the most critical problem in our region:Mike Belle the plight of the sick,
Speaking Out hungry, homeless and
hopeless. And a strong
stance against increas-
ing tuition is a message that many would
rally for.
Imagine if there was an SG party that com-
mitted itself to this sort of noble work first and
foremost as an extension of a shared, lifelong
commitment to a set of core principles?
Why isn't there a Democratic party in SG
politics, a group of registered Democrats who
are committed to higher-minded goals? For
that matter, why isn't there a Republican par-
ty in SG committed to cutting wasteful spend-
ing and lowering student fees? Why is there
just a bunch of fake movements with catchy
action words for names, two-year shelf lives
and the same silly platform planks?
People I have talked to about this idea
have told me that real political parties have
no place in SG, that it would be illegitimate.
These people are the ones participating in SG
politics, to whom I respectfully respond that
SG is already illegitimate. I should know; I
was a student senator for a year. I even held a
seat on the Budget Committee, which means
something to maybe 13 percent of you.
Maybe.

student.

phenomenon is getting ridiculous. I un-
derstand that in the United States we
support a plurality of opinion and the
concept of free speech. However, since
when do we passively allow blatant
hatred and bigotry to go unchecked?
Though I don't typically lecture people
on the absolutes of "right" and "wrong,"
this is definitely an instance in our lives
where we need to take a step back and
say, "Damn it, that is wrong!"
The DWOC is abusing the liberal
idea of freedom of speech and opinion
by socializing young recruits to be hate-
ful, i.e. Martin Boecken, 15. What kind
of parents allow their child to march in
a hate parade? Furthermore, what kind
of parent allows his or her child to go to
school with an "Islam is of the Devil" T-
shirt, let alone with two different socks?
I don't know about anyone else, but
I'm sick and tired of this group profess-

dernity.

Former soldier meditates with inmates
By VANESSA DIMAGGIO
Alligator Contributing Writer
As they walk into the stark gray
room at the Lowell Correctional
Institution in Ocala, K.C. Walpole
greets each inmate with the grace of a
mentor and the sternness of a soldier.
Dressed in all black, his head shaved
smooth and his broad shoulders fit
into perfect posture.
"Are you full of fire and brim-
stone?" he asks a woman as a smile
dimples his aging face.
She nods at him.
"Is there anything we can do to fix
that today?"
She points to her head, grabs an
imaginary object from it then tosses
it away.
"Yeah, let's get rid of those
thoughts," Walpole agrees.
Walpole, 66, visits the female in-
mates at Lowell every Friday at 9 a.m.
He teaches them to sit for 15 minutes
or more without moving, talking or
thinking -the Buddhist practice of
meditation.
Walpole, who leads monks at
the Gateless Gate Zen Center in
Gainesville, has held about 1,800
meditation and Zen programs for
inmates at 25 of Florida's prisons. In
a state where the inmate population
nears 100,000 and where one-third
of released inmates are jailed again
within three years, his programs aim
to reduce the number of inmates who
end up back behind bars.
He uses meditation to help the
prisoners develop self-discipline and
impulse control to reveal the reason
they first entered prison.
"If people are at peace with them-
selves, then they're at peace with
the world, and they can handle the
world," Walpole said.
Walpole founded the Gateless
Gate in High Springs in 1997. At his
first meditation session there, a man
brought a letter from an inmate at
Marion Correctional Institution ask-
ing for someone to teach him. Walpo-
le agreed, and within a year or two,
he was visiting prisons.
Walpole didn't always live the
meditative life of the Buddhist faith,
though. He served in the military for
nearly 25 years, working in the mid-
'70s and early '80s as a Green Beret,
training commandos in El Salvador
as the country erupted with violence.
When guerrillas assassinated one
of his closest friends, a life filled with
grief, violence and paranoia caughtup with him.
"I guess you could say I was en-
joying some of the aftereffects of mili-
tary service in the fast lane," Walpole
said. "You could call it [post-traumat-
ic stress disorder]."
He turned to yoga and meditation
and retired from the military in 1985.
"Twenty-fours years of soldiering
was enough," Walpole said.
Marcia Frazier, who attended a
meditation program at Broward Cor-
rectional Institution, said Walpole is
a "stealth bomber" when it comes to
teaching her life lessons.
"He gets in exactly where he needs
to be without you even knowing it,"
Frazier said.
Sitting at the mom-and-pop bagel
shop where she works as a cook, Fra-
zier rolled up her sleeves and twisted
her stringy, long brown hair into a
bun as she recalls her first meditation
practice.
"It was hard, man," she said as she
tapped her pack of Marlboros on the
table. "Meditation for me is very, very
difficult. I can't even sit still here."
During her first meditation, the
instructor told Frazier to stay present
with the moment, but she couldn't.
Her sentence had just been re-
duced, and she could see the fin-
ish line. She didn't know where she
would go or how she would get her
life together.
She tried to stop thinking and fo-
cus on her breath. She heard a guard
outside yell, "Inmate, get in line!"
"Oh my God," she remembered.
"I'm in prison."
She still can't achieve a clear mind
during meditation, she said, but Wal-
pole calms her. He tells her every-
thing is as it should be, and we are all
perfect in this moment.
Frazier met Walpole at a ceremo-
ny at the prison where she vowed to
live a wholesome, ethical life.
He walked in with his "Obi-Wan
Kenobi" robes, his Buddha statues
and some incense. He called her
name, then whacked a wooden stick
and startled her.
But it was during the end of the
ceremony, when she was supposed
to receive a burn on her hand, that
Walpole showed his true colors.
The department of corrections
didn't allow the bum.
"It was considered destruction of
state property," Frazier said. "I have
never in my entire life known such
compassion, total compassion, he
had in his eyes when he told me thathe was taking my burn for me."
Walpole burned himself once for
Frazier then 11 more times for the
other inmates at the ceremony.
Two years ago, Walpole visited
any prisoner who asked.
He bought cars, drove them until
they nearly broke down, then traded
them for new ones. In three years, he
clocked at least 100,000 miles a car.
But two years ago, Walpole had
stents put in his heart, and his doc-
tor told him he had to cut back on
his prison service. Then, about a year
ago, Walpole had an aneurysm and
came back with three more pieces of
metal in his heart.
Now Walpole only visits two pro-
grams and helps run five others.He has to start paying more at-
tention to himself, he says. The wall
of a tiny blood vessel in his heart has
stretched and ballooned to the point
where it could burst, and he could
bleed out before any help could get
to him.
He doesn't know when it could
rupture. It could be tomorrow, or it
could be in 10 years.
"I have to focus on developing
leadership potential so that the place
will survive if I don't," Walpole said.
Walpole says he will do whatever
he can until, as he likes to call it, he
stops "sucking air."
"I haven't half-stepped any part
of my life up 'til now," Walpole said.
"No point in starting."
K.C. Walpole, a former enlisted Marine and Army officer, teaches med-
itation to inmates in 25 Florida prisons.
$584M spent on research in 2008
FUNDING,from page 1
"With computers, we can design
explosives that are safer to handle and
more effective," Rogacki said.
To receive funding, researchers and
their teams often have to send out ex-
tensive proposals to the agencies solic-
iting ideas.
"Almost all research gets funded
by someone else," Rogacki said. "But
it's funded on a competitive basis, and
there are a lot of good universities out
there."
One university is the University of
South Florida. Ranked a distant sec-
ond in the state behind UF, The Tampa
Tribune reported the foundation's esti-
mate of about $278 million allocated toresearch spending at the university.
Rogacki welcomes the competition.
"I don't view USF or other univer-
sities as threats," he said. "I think cer-
tainly for the good of the nation, the
more researchers we have, the better
off we're going to be."
Rogacki applies the same mind-
set to other
UF universities,
Administration crediting the
competitive
nature of research funding as creative
fuel.
"When someone like UCF or USF
or FSU or any other university gets bet-
ter, they force us to get better," Rogacki
said. "We welcome their competition,
and we appreciate the contribution
they make."Charles elected Senate President

"It may be frightening and unfamiliar
now," Cavataro said. "It won't always be."
Supervisor of Elections Ariana Alfonso
stopped by the meeting to go over results from
last week's election. Senators approved them
by unanimous consent.
Once old senators said their goodbyes, the
newly-elected senators got down to business.
Their first act was to elect new Senate leader-
ship.
Unite Party Sen. Ashton Charles was
elected Senate President and Unite Party Sen.
Naadira Renfroe was elected as Senate Presi-dent Pro-Tempore.
CLAS Sen. Andre Haughton, from the
Unite Party, endorsed Renfroe, who represents
the sophomore class.
Haughton said his reasons for supporting
Renfroe extended beyond her resume and
work ethic. He said Renfroe would prevent
Senate from becoming isolated from the stu-
dents it represents.
"I'm confident that Sen. Renfroe will em-
body this dream and keep it alive," he said.
Unite Party Sophomore Class Sen. Kara
Olesky said she supported Charles, who rep-
resents District A, because she is a great role
model and will work for students.

Frozen yogurt shops to open downtown, near campus
0 NEW STORES INCLUDE TUTTI
FRUTTI, SECOND M OCHI.
By ESTEE BECK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville has a soft spot for frozen yo-
gurt.
Two new stores will join Gainesville's
bevy of yogurt shops.
Florida's first Tutti Frutti, a self-serve fro-
zen yogurt shop, will open at 1232 W Univer-
sity Ave. No information was available about
its projected open date, but the location is
listed on the company's Web site.The second store, located on the first floor
of the new downtown Hampton Inn & Suites,
will be Gainesville's second Mochi. One of
the managers, Jurel Serrana, said business has
been good at the company's Archer Road lo-
cation, which opened during Summer A. The
new store is expected to open in January.
Mochi's business hours are noon to mid-
night every day. According to Serrana, the
downtown store will have the same hours,
but it may be open later on weekends for
clubgoers.
While Mochi is expanding, other yogurt
shops aren't afraid of the competition.
Yogaberry general manager Jennifer Fich-ter said she expects the store to stay afloat in
the flooding market.
"Is [the competition] daunting? No, not
really," Fichter said. "It's all about what kind
of PR you do."
Fichter said that Yogaberry's coffee menu
and pastry assortments
Around make it unique from otherGainesville yogurt shops. She said the
shop is trying to keep the
customers who loved Deja Brew.
Mochi finds its individuality in the envi-
ronmentally friendliness of its product, Ser-
rana said.
The cups and spoons at Mochi are madeof plant starch and biodegradable materials.
The yogurt machines have an energy-saving
cooling system, and some of the decor is
made from partially recycled materials.
To keep customers coming back for that
frozen fix during the cold months, Serrana
said Mochi will play around with new flavors
and take requests from customers. Serrana
said frozen yogurt is a healthy alternative to
other desserts.
She said new designs for the downtown
Mochi are in the making.
"I think Mochi is really different," Serrana
said. "I think frozen yogurt is going to be here
for a while."

About 50 UF students at-
tended Tuesday night's Mind
MashUp with laptops in hand
ready to learn about open-
source software.
The event was held by Flori-
da Free Culture in Library West
in honor of the the first interna-
tional Open Access Week, from
Oct.19 to Oct. 23, which aims to
broaden students' understand-
ing of open access.
During the two-hour event,
students learned to remix im-
ages, music and videos licensed
under Creative Commons, an
alternative copyrighting sys-
tem, said Jennifer Griffith, pres-
ident of Florida Free Culture.
Club members demon-
strated how to use open source
software programs like Audac-ity, Blender, Inkscape and The
GIMP.
Griffith, a third-year elec-
trical engineering major, said
the club's goal was to raise
awareness about the software
resources that are available to
students.
Griffith said the club hoped
to "foster a spirit of innova-
tion."
Angela Austin, a fourth-year
anthropology major, attended
the workshop.
"We need to increase free
software in the way that we
communicate and transmit
ideas," she said.
Austinhopes societyevolves
past copyright. "It must come
from people using the program,
not the company," she said.
She said there is no way to
avoid open sharing because it's
a part of the culture.
"It's a digital age," she said.Stu

Tebow returns to limited practice
* THE SENIOR STILL ISN'T
CLEARED FOR CONTACT.
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator org
Florida quarterback Tim Tebow
returned to practice in a limited
role Tuesday after being cleared for
non-contact drills.
Coach Urban Meyer said Tebow
split snaps 50-50 with backup John
Brantley, and discussions will con-
tinue for the next few days about
whether or not Tebow can and
should play at LSU on Saturday.
"He didn't go full, and it was ob-
viously non-contact," Meyer said.
"I'd say he did probably 80 percent
of practice. He did well. A little
rusty, not really from anything oth-
er than that he hasn't played foot-
ball in over a week."
Meyer said Tebow worked out
and did some conditioning Sunday
and Monday, and a team of experts
including trainers, physicians, a
neurosurgeon and a neurologist
were involved in clearing him to
practice.
"He looked like Tim out there
today," Meyer said. "Obviously
he practiced a lot differently than

Preseason polls give false sense of upsets in college football
Apparently, this is the year of the upset
in college football.
LI But why?
Sure, seven teams ranked in the top 10 of
the AP preseason poll already have at least
one loss on their records, but what makes
these teams considered elite before the season
begins?
It is the preseason polls that create these
notions that some teams are the best in the na-
tion when eventually they will prove they are
nothing more than frauds.
Every year, a bunch of voters decide which
teams are the best in the nation based offA
Bobby Callovi
Bobby's World
bca Ilovi@a Iligator orgtheir performances in
the previous season,
player turnover in the
offseason and their
schedules heading into
the season.
Nowhere in the
consideration is how
teams have fared so far
through the season.
Once the teams
have been voted to a spot in the rankings, only
a loss can significantly drop them from that
spot, and only a loss by another team can al-low them to leap in the rankings.
This makes it hard for a team that has
played extremely well in the current year to
move up on its own, and God forbid that team
loses a game, because it probably will find it-
self in the back half of the top 25 or out of the
poll altogether.
But teams like USC and Oklahoma barely
fall after losses. Neither team fell out of the top
15 after its early season loss, and USC's defeat
came at the hands of unranked Washington.
This system makes every season the year
of the upset in college football because no
one really knows if any of these teams in thepreseason top 10 will be as good as they are
expected to be.
Since 2002, only once have the AP voters
been correct in the preseason about which
team would be the best in the nation at the end
-USC was No. 1 before and after the 2004
season.
And the rest of their top 10s have not
looked much better.
In that same time, 2007 had the most pre-
season top 10 teams (six) finish there after
year's end.

writers. Check out a recap of the week's ac-
tion at alligatorSports.org.Brantley preps
as possible
starter vs. LSU
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@aligator org
When Florida's starting quarterback takes the field
at Tiger Stadium on Saturday night, he will have gone
through a week of prank calls from LSU fans.
It's just unclear who "he" will be.
While senior Tim Tebow returned to practice Tues-
day, his status for UF's game Saturday is still uncertain.
LSU fans apparently wanted to take every precau-
tion, so they acquired sophomore John
Brantley's cell phone number and have
been berating him with calls and text
messages.
Football Tebow went through a similar thing in
the week before the team's 2007 matchup.
After scoring a touchdown two years ago,
Tebow celebrated by pretending to dial a phone.
So far, LSU fans have treated Brantley like an equal off
the field, but how will UF's offense change if it is No. 12
and not No. 15 taking the snaps Saturday night?
Offensive coordinator Steve Addazio said any altera-
tions would be slight.
"He's got a good grasp of the whole offense," Add-
azio said. "Obviously, like always, we'll always have
little things that feature someone's personal strengths
-John's a real thrower -that's something you can fea-
ture a little bit. The bottom line is he's been trained to run
our offense, and he'll run the offense, and he'll do it real
well."
All of Brantley's playing time so far has come after UF
had secured a victory. He has appeared in three of four
games this season and completed 22 of 30 passes for 232
yards and four touchdowns, good for a 182.29 passer ef-
ficiency rating.
If he plays Saturday, he will face a LSU pass defense

Gators will charter after match with Gamecocks
0 THE RETURN TO GAINESVILLE IS
UF'S ONLY CHARTER THIS SEASON.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@alligator org
While other Southeastern Conference
teams have been flying first-class, the Gators
have been the class of the league -and saving
money in the process.
Several other SEC schools have incurred
the added expense of chartering flights -
Mississippi State's volleyball team had its own
plane for three full weekends last season, and
Kentucky is doing the same this season -but
UF has only chartered one flight per season in
recent years.
"I don't know why they (other programs)
make those choices, but at the end of the day,
dollars are dollars," said Lynda Tealer, the
senior associate athletic director for women's
sports. "So you may opt to spend dollars in
that way, but then you don't have them to
spend on something else."
After kicking off a four-match road swing
with a rare midweek contest against South
Carolina (10-5, 2-4 SEC) in Columbia tonight
at 7, No. 6 Florida (11-2, 5-1 SEC) will enjoythe once-in-a-season luxury three other UF
sports use regularly: a chartered flight back to
Gainesville.
Commercial travel has alreadyhad its share
of ups and downs for the Gators this year. Af-
ter sweeping Arkansas on the road on Sept. 20,
UF coach Mary Wise said in a radio interview
that the team would only make its flight if it
won in three sets.
"We'd absolutely love to charter every
single away match, but it's just not like that,"
junior opposite hitter Lauren Bledsoe said.
"And those regular flights, they work out just
great. We make it work.
"Sitting here wishing, it just doesn't matter.
We've handled it."
This weekend, commercial airfare could
provide another difficulty for UF. With its next
two matches being televised on ESPNU at 7
p.m., the Gators are subject to the network's
scheduling. That means their Sunday match
at LSU will end too late to catch a flight back
that night, so they will have to travel back to
Gainesville early Monday morning.
"That really is an oddity because I can't
think of any other sport or program where
there's typically Sunday evening competi-
tion," Tealer said. "It just doesn't happen."
Although commercial airfare and busing
may be harder on the players and coaches, it
lightens the financial load on the athletics pro-gram.
"I think the only benefit for chartering is
convenience, which is a legitimate benefit,
but that's really the only benefit," Tealer said.
"The cost is just so incredibly significant when
you have that many competitions."
The Gators football, men's basketball and
women's basketball teams charter their own
flights on a regular basis when necessary.
Tealer said the cost simply
- outweighs the convenience
of chartering flights for other
UF sports. Aside from foot-Volleyball ball and basketball, every
V l b team at Florida only charters
a return flight for midweek
matches or under extenuating circumstances.
According to Tealer, the average cost of
sending the volleyball team round-trip on
commercial flights is around $4,500 to $5,000.
The lowest a chartered plane would cost for
the same trip is about $25,000.
"When you multiply that over the course of
the season for all of the teams, it just becomes
a really unmanageable amount of money to
spend on travel," Tealer said.
For the Florida volleyball program, the
money saved through busing or flying com-
mercial can be reallocated to paying for coach-
es, managers, equipment, the training staff or
scholarships.Each decision has its benefits and detri-
ments, but the more money available for
scholarships, the more Wise and her coaching
staff can recruit the best players possible, par-
ticularly out-of-state athletes.
According to a University Athletic Associa-
tion expense report, the volleyball program's
scholarship budget is the sixth largest of all
UF sports, behind football, women's track,
women's swimming, women's basketball and
soccer.
Six of UF's 15 players are from Florida, so
the cost of offering scholarships to the nine out-
of-state players is greater than that of, for ex-
ample, Florida's baseball program, which has
a lower scholarship limit (11.7 to volleyball's
12) and primarily recruits in-state athletes.
Despite the lower cost of recruiting, the
baseball team operates under the same travel
circumstances as the volleyball team -only
for midweek competitions or under extenu-
ating circumstances, like getting the student-
athletes back from Columbia on Wednesday
night in time for class Thursday.
"Typically, when they compete on Friday
and Sunday -unless something goes bad on
that Sunday return, which unfortunately, that
happens for a lot of our teams; traveling in and
out of Gainesville can sometimes be challeng-
ing -but for the most part, they're able to
minimize their missed classes," Tealer said.

UF learns from loss
* OLE MISS DEFEATED
FLORIDA 3-2 ON SUNDAY.
By EUGENIO TORRIENS
Alligator Writer

The fall from grace is swift and
unforeseen.
The UF soccer team's most re-
cent 3-2 double overtime loss to
Mississippi on Sunday ushered in
the possibility of a new mindset in
the Southeastern Conference: the
Gators are vulnerable.
UF coach Becky Burleigh and
her players all echoed the same
thing, it's up to them to change
other people's perception.
"Our players come here to win
the SEC and we're certainly not
giving up that fight," Burleigh
said. "We have too much talent on
this team for this thing to not turn
around."
By tying Mississippi State last
Friday, 1-1, UF broke its 22-game
SEC regular-season win streak that
started Oct. 7, 2007.
Sophomore Lindsay Thompson
said it was two different teams
from the state of Mississippi than
the ones the Gators (8-4-1, 2-1-1
SEC) beat last year en route to an
11-0 conference record.
"I feel like we have to bounce
back and do what we can this
weekend to prove that we're still
somebody who is going to be reck-
oned with in the SEC," Thompson
said.
For a program that has finished
first in the SEC the last three years,
a tie and loss in consecutive SEC
matches is something other confer-
ence foes can feed upon.
"I think teams have probablygotten a little arrogant because the
team that went undefeated last year
kind of stumbled this past week,"
senior Angela Napolitano said.
While the loss is a blemish on
the record, players tried to take it
as a lesson.
"I think that it's good in the
sense that it humbles us," Napoli-
tano said. "It reminds us that if we
don't come out the way we need to,
that we can get beat by anybody."
Redshirt freshman McKenzie
Barney, whose first two college
goals came against Vanderbilt, said
it reinforced the constant focus the
team needs to have.
"Nothing worth
having is going to
come easy at all this
season," she said.
Soccer "We can't let down
for one game, we can't
let down for one second."
Barney said it doesn't matter
how other teams in the conference
perceive the Gators, and that it
shouldn't affect the way the team
executes. She said part of the plan is
making sure UF dictates the tempo
and plays its fast-paced offense.
"Personally I always think -
well I know -that we're a good
team," Barney said.
If anything, the team will hope
that history repeats itself. The 22-
game SEC regular-season win
streak began after back-to-back
losses at Georgia and at Tennes-
see.
If the team has fallen in the SEC
totem pole, the climb back up will
partly rest on the upperclassmen's
experience.
"We've been here before," Na-
politano said. "We've come back
and it's not anything that's out of
our reach by any means.FOOT, from page 17
that's third-worst in the South-
eastern Conference.
Sophomore wide receiver
Deonte Thompson, one of the
team's best deep options, is ex-
pected to play this weekend af-
ter missing the last two games.
"We've got so many play-
makers at this school," Brantley
said. "To go in there and see
those playmakers in the huddle
with you, that gives you confi-
dence."
Brantley will also be aided
by the nation's top rushing of-
fense. The Gators are averaging
307.5 yards per game behind
Tebow and their trio of run-
ning backs -Jeff Demps, Chris
Rainey and Emmanuel Moody.
Each of the three is averaging
more than 8 yards per carry.
Running backs coach Ken-
ny Carter acknowledged his
guys might carry a heavier
load if Tebow doesn't play
but stressed the importance of
throwing the ball.
"The passing game is a vital
part of what you have to do to
be successful in this league,"
Carter said. "You can't be one-
dimensional. Us being produc-
live is huge, but we have to
play well at quarterback too."
While relatively untested
in college, Brantley came to
Gainesville as the sixth-best
quarterback prospect coming
out of high school, according to
Rivals.com
Now Florida's undefeated
record may rest on Brantley's
shoulders.
"Anytime you don't have aHarrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff

guy like Tim Tebow who's ar-
guably the best college football
player in America -stop right
there," Addazio said. "But John
Brantley is a hell of a football
player. I mean a big-time guy.
"We're going to have somewrinkles for John Brantley like
we always would, but John
Brantley will run our offense
and John Brantley will com-
pete. John Brantley would be
starting for a lot of teams in this
conference right now."

While Johnny Hamui's at-
tempt to get a second Gator into
the men's main draw of the ITA
All American Championships

Tuesday, freshman Lauren Em-
bree was dominant in her first
and second round of qualifying
and still has a shot at joining
Marrit Boonstra in the women's
draw.
So too does freshman Allie
Will, who was selected to com-
pete in the qualifying draw de-
spite a loss in the pre-qualifyingtournament.
Embree blew out No. 70
Lenka Hojckova of North Caro-
lina State 6-0, 6-1 and followed
that up with a 6-4, 6-1 win over
No. 52 Liset Brito in her second
round match on Tuesday. The
win brings Embree to 4-0 in her
UF career, with each win coming
against a ranked opponent.
"Lauren was very aggres-
sive today, and that's something
we've been working a lot on in
practice," associate head coach
Dave Balogh said.
Also in action on Tuesday was
Will, who by a stroke of luck got
selected to play in the qualifying
tournament and made the mostof her opportunity with wins doubles action for the season.

Last year was arguably the
pollsters'worst, though.
Only four teams stayed in the
top 10 after the season, and three
of those preseason top-10 teams
were not even ranked by year's
end -LSU, Clemson and Au-
burn.
This season, the preseason poll
has obviously not gotten off to a
good start with four top 10 teams
already out of that group.
These preseason polls are fun
for fans and make it easier for the
media to call a season the year of
the upset when preseason predic-
tions begin to crumble, but they
don't do any good for college
football.
All they really do is make
things harder for teams that en-
ter the season already considered
not very good despite not playing
a down.
A lot of these teams aren't
good and were rightfully left
out of the preseason polls, but
they should at least be given the
chance to prove they suck before
being labeled as such.
In a similar fashion, some of
the teams in the preseason polls
are top teams, but they should
have to prove it on the field, rath-
er than be given an advantage by
a bunch of voters who are mak-
ing guesses.
