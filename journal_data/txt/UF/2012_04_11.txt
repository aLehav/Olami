  Walker Finn’s gun is a 
force to be reckoned with.
  He’ll need it today for the 
beginning of the end of the 
world.
  The 20-year-old mechani-
cal engineering sophomore is one of about 400 students ready for Humans vs. Zom-bies, the ﬁ  ve-day, apocalyp-tic game of tag played across campus that begins today.
  Players start as humans, 
except for the original zom-bie, who turns players into zombies by touching them. 
Zombies try to tag humans, 
who in turn try to survive un-til the ﬁ  nal mission Sunday.
  Humans can shoot zom-
bies with toy darts or throw socks at them to stun them temporarily.
Bandanas are used to dis-
tinguish the teams — zombies wear bandanas on their heads and humans wear them on their arms. Moderators wear one bandana on each arm.
  Rebecca Foster, 21-year-old 
psychology junior and presi-dent of Gators HvZ, said the number of people registering each semester has leveled off at about 300 to 500 players. 
As of Tuesday, 270 stu-
dents were registered, and Foster expects about 400 play-ers. 
She said the game, which 
includes a story and missions, grew as it was more accepted on campus.
  HvZ used money from 
Student Government to pay $300 for ﬂ  iers and $1,300 for bandanas. 
Players who don’t return 
bandanas are banned.
  The zombies have won sev-
en of the eight games played at UF since Spring 2010, Fos-ter said.
  The game gave Finn a 
chance to put his hobby of modifying dart guns to good use.
  The self-proclaimed “ca-
reer human” said he can’t re-sist the thrill of shooting the walking dead.
  “It feels awesome to sur-
vive insurmountable odds against zombies,” he said. Humans vs. Zombies takes bite out of UF

  People who ﬂ  y from Gainesville will soon 
have another airline option.
  Beginning Sunday, Silver Airways will of-
fer passenger ﬂ  ights from Gainesville Regional 
Airport to Tampa International Airport and Orlando International Airport.
  “We are in a nice growth period,” said 
Laura Aguiar, manager of public relations and governmental affairs.
  Tickets are $49 one way, which is an intro-
ductory rate.
  Passengers will be charged $25 for the ﬁ  rst piece of checked luggage and $35 for the sec-ond.  Flights last less than one hour.
  Aguiar said the new ﬂ  ights will allow some 
passengers to avoid Atlanta International Air-port, one of the busiest airports in the world.
  “Another airline gives them another con-
nection option, another price point, another reason to ﬂ  y their local airport,” she said.
  Silver Airways moved its operation from 
Ft. Lauderdale to take advantage of an empty hangar at the Gainesville Regional Airport. The airline will bring about 100 jobs to Gainesville.
  Laurel McKay, a 20-year-old civil engineer-
ing sophomore, uses the Gainesville Regional Airport about four times a year, at the begin-ning and end of each semester.
  McKay doesn’t go home to Massachusetts 
very often. She said it’s too expensive to travel. A roundtrip ﬂ  ight costs up to $300.
  She said she might ﬁ  nd cheaper connecting 
ﬂ  ights through Tampa or Orlando compared to Atlanta. Because of that, she might be able to go home more often.
  “It’s a more feasible option, and time-wise 
it’s not too much more traveling,” she said. New airline brings cheap Tampa, Orlando ﬂ  ights� MOE’S HOSTED

  When Michael Crace was about 
12 years old, he grabbed an orna-
mental pepper and looked at his uncle. Don’t even think about put-ting that in your mouth, Charlie Crace told him.
  “I can eat them,” Michael said.  “No, you can’t,” Charlie re-
plied. “Them are too hot.”
  “Watch me.”  Michael popped the pepper 
into his mouth and chewed.
  “I stood there 
for a minute be-fore I went and got the bread to 
cool his mouth off,” Charlie said Tuesday evening. “That boy had tears in his eyes.”
  On the night of April 2, Michael 
Crace died after three pulls by his roommate’s trigger ﬁ  nger. He was 20 years old.
  According to Gainesville Po-
lice, Jude Rizzo put a trio of bullets in Michael’s chest in self-defense. Michael pulled a pistol ﬁ  rst, Rizzo and his brother, Joel, told ofﬁ  cers. There were no other witnesses.
  Michael worked at the Moe’s 
Southwest Grill at 7770 W Newber-ry Road. The restaurant hosted a fundraiser Tuesday, with proceeds from customers with a ticket going to the Craces to help the family pay for Michael’s funeral.
  Charlie was sitting with Mi-
chael’s grandfather, Harold, and telling old stories about the boy.
  But Michael’s family and co-
workers share  doubts about the Death of 
Santa Fe student still being         investigated

Rick Santorum withdrew from the race for the Republican 
presidential nomination Tuesday afternoon.
The move came a day after the former senator brought his 
3-year-old daughter, Bella, home from the hospital. 
According to news reports, she has a rare genetic condition 
and contracted pneumonia.
Ryan Garcia, president of UF College Republicans, said he was excited to learn of Santorum’s an-
nouncement. 
The 21-year-old economics junior said 
Santorum’s decision to withdraw from the race was right for the party.
The primary has divided the party, Gar -
cia said. He’s ready for Republicans to unite instead of fighting over who will receive the 
nomination.
UF College Republicans has not endorsed a candidate but will support the official nominee.
The organization’s vice chairwoman, 20-year-old telecom-
munication and political science junior Katy Melchiorre, said she thinks most former Santorum supporters will now follow candidate Mitt Romney . 
Other politicians in the GOP race include Newt Gingrich 
and Ron Paul.
“It’s time that we all coalesced around one candidate and 
got ready to take on President Obama,” Garcia said.

� PRICE RESPONDS TO HATE 
INCIDENT ON CAMPUS.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Writer
Student Senate President Aundre 
Price announced at Tuesday’s meet-
ing that he is forming a temporary committee to take action against hate crimes at UF.
Price announced the formation of 
the Bias and Apprehension Commit-tee, led by Sen. Monya Sharp.
The committee will review the uni-
versity’s policies on hate crimes and create a plan to reduce the chances of them occurring on campus. The com-mittee will deal with gender, sexual orientation, ethnic and racial discrimi-nation.After the meeting, Price said a po-
tential action could be sending a mes-sage through listservs saying UF does not support hate and discrimination.
Price said he was mainly spurred to 
create the committee by a hate crime that happened on campus.
A petition supporting justice for 
Trayvon Martin was found with “F--k That N----r” scrawled in red marker.
Sen. Umair Asghar said the petition 
was on a table at a Students for Demo-cratic Society rally for Trayvon. During the marching, someone wrote that and ran away, he said.
The Senate also unanimously 
passed a resolution condemning hate crimes and discrimination.
“You can spread awareness and 
hopefully change things,” Price said.

narrative given to police.
Jude was not arrested, but the investiga-
tion is still open, said GPD spokeswoman Cpl. 
Angelina Valuri. Detectives await an autopsy report, and a final decision concerning Jude could take months.
Tabitha Hardy, who worked with Michael, said Michael told her he did not get along with his roommates. He didn’t think they could pay the rent, and he said he caught the broth-ers stealing marijuana from him twice.
Michael wanted to fight the Rizzos, Hardy 
said, but he knew better. The brothers were bigger than he was.
Hardy said she and her co-workers learned 
Michael was dead while at Moe’s. He was sup-posed to show up the next morning at 9:45. He always came on time, sweaty after the four-mile bike ride from his house to work.
Somebody at Moe’s read about Michael’s 
death on his Facebook page. Then, Hardy thought back to the day before. He looked pale, sick, distracted. Very different from his normal demeanor.
Hardy became close with Michael because he wasn’t afraid to look foolish. He laughed at your jokes. If you liked sports, he talked sports. If you liked music, he talked music.
“He could be friends with anybody,” Har -
dy said. “He was the most outgoing person you could know.”
And tough. Tough enough to eat a pepper 
to prove a point.

Gainesville Police arrested 
a woman for allegedly driving 
drunk and hitting a pole near Archer Road while her three children were in the car.
Myra A. Flowers, 27, of Ar -
cher, was booked on charges of child neglect at about 11:30 p.m. Monday. She drove her Nissan Altima into a pole at Exxon Mo-bil, 3960 SW Archer Road, and steered north on Southwest 40th Boulevard, her lights off and tires straddling both lanes, a witness told police. 
When Officer Shawn Hard-
man found Flowers in the Red Roof Inn parking lot, she sup-ported herself against the car. 
Its front license plate was 
bent, the right tire sat on top of the parking block and a bottle of Bud Light lay next to the pas-senger door.
 The children were still in the car, police said.
Flowers’ speech was slurred. 
Her eyes were bloodshot. Her hands shook. 
The hotel’s front desk clerk 
told officers Flowers seemed drunk when she arrived earlier that day. The clerk couldn’t read Flowers’ signature on the check-
in form, so her 10-year-old daughter wrote her 
m o t h e r ’ s name. 
Flowers 
told officers she had four or five beers 
before driving to the hotel.
After checking in, Flowers 
told the clerk she and her chil-dren were going to McDonald’s, to which her daughter asked, “We are walking, right?”

Some Gainesville residents and UF students aren’t happy 
with city and county commissioners being backseat drivers.
Within the past week, several residents have written emails 
to the City Commission disagreeing with a proposed plan to 
reduce the speed limit on a section of Interstate 75. Some stu-dents aren’t thrilled with the idea, either.
Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe and 11 other commission-
ers asked the Florida Department of Transportation early this month to look into changing the speed limit.
Lowe said he wants to decrease the speed limit from 70 mph to 55 mph between County Road 234 and State Road 222 to protect drivers, especially considering the aftermath of the Jan. 29 crashes on I-75  that killed 11 people.
In an email to Lowe, Gainesville resident Richard Allen said 
lowering the speed limit to 65 mph is an option, but any lower would be unnecessary.
“A reduction to 55 mph would be both inefficient and to-
tally inappropriate,” he said.Sarah Kleinman, a 22-year-old history senior, said reducing 
the speed limit could lead to more rear-end collisions if drivers aren’t cautious about the change.
Nadeige Pierre, a 21-year-old criminology junior, said low-
ering the speed limit would make the drive worse for truck drivers and commuters and called the proposed change “in-convenient.”
In an interview earlier this month, Lowe said the speed limit 
needs to be reduced to protect drivers from crashes when there are a lot of cars on the road.
“Speed definitely factors into a reaction time, which factors 
into having an accident or having an accident with a fatality ,” Lowe said.

cient and totally inappropriate.”

Justice for Trayvon 
means no violence
Last week, the leader of a neo-Nazi group claimed its 
members were conducting armed patrols of Sanford, Fla., where Trayvon Martin was shot.
While Sanford police have not confirmed evidence of such 
patrols, people are worried about possible escalations in vio-lence due to the racial tensions created by this controversial issue.
Soon after the shooting, the New Black Panthers offered a 
$10,000 reward for the capture of George Zimmerman, claim-ing that Zimmerman should have been arrested for shooting Trayvon.
Earlier this week, shots were fired at an empty police car in 
the neighborhood where Trayvon was killed.
In our own backyard this weekend, a 27-year-old man 
was beaten while walking home from bars in midtown. The man’s injuries showed signs that he was attacked by a group of people, said Gainesville Police Department spokeswoman Cpl. Angelina Valuri.
Valuri told the Gainesville Sun the attackers were black 
males who, the victim said, shouted “Trayvon” before they beat him.
Of course, this is just an account of the incident by the 
victim, so it is hard to say whether they proclaimed “Tray-von” before they beat him or not, or even whether they were black.
However, if the victim’s accounts of the incident are accu-
rate, this attack is clearly symptomatic of an increase in vio-lence related to Trayvon’s shooting.
The escalation of and calls for violence following the Tray-
von Martin killing have gotten out of hand for people on both sides of this issue. Of course, Trayvon’s shooting has greatly affected many people in this country. It has accentuated dor-mant racial tensions, causing divides and often furious de-bates about our justice system.
Are there flaws in America’s justice system?Absolutely.Does this fact provide a legitimate excuse to call for or en-
gage in violent acts?
Absolutely not.If an injustice occurred, it can and should be discussed, 
questioned and ultimately condemned.
However, by turning to violence in the face of injustice, 
the initial act of injustice or violence will be overshadowed by further unnecessary violence and escalation.
None of us knows what really happened the night Trayvon 
was killed. Of course we can speculate, and there are many factors that were off about the incident and its subsequent in-vestigation.
But violence will not bring justice to Trayvon, and it will 
not lead to a better understanding of what happened that night. Instead, our energy should be directed at discovering the truth and making the necessary changes to prevent it from happening again.Society should only change when necessary
Most of us enter college with the intention to 
change society for the better. College students are natural catalysts for change   — we organize 
protests, debate in our classrooms and then return home 
to antagonize our more traditional parents.
As Woodrow Wilson said, “The purpose of a uni-
versity should be to make a son as unlike his father as possible.” Should we ever question this modern trend? Could there really be such a thing as too much change?
In the last 100 years, the Western world has under -
gone more cultural and societal upheaval than in the previous 900. The oldest among us have seen two world wars, the rise and fall of communism, the civil rights movement, the sexual revolution and the rise of both consumer capitalism and socialism.
Superpowers have risen and been struck down. Na-
tional borders have been erased and then redrawn. The previous definitions of marriage, sex and pregnancy have been shredded. The Internet, the most potent in-vention of all, has forced itself into our lives, fundamen-tally changing the way human beings communicate.
All of this occurred in less time than it took the early 
Christian Church to debate the nature of the Trinity.
These constant, exponential societal transitions are 
the result of the post-industrial age in which we live. We are conditioned to believe that the new is always better than the old in the same way a computer is better than a typewriter or the iPhone 4 is better than the iPhone 3. Calling something “archaic” has become an insult when it could just as easily be a compliment.
Consider the slogans of President Barack Obama’s 
2008 campaign — “change we can believe in” and “yes we can.” Can what? It did not appear to matter what sort of change occurred as long as we were changing.
Norms and customs exist for a reason: They calm the 
wicked hearts of mankind, allowing us to live together in peace. Common culture forms a rich, interwoven tap-estry that maintains human-kind. Sometimes, it should be modified to resolve flagrant injustice. However, one can pull too many strings, and it appears that we take the exis-tence of human civilization for granted these days. As of late, the Western world has yanked on its own cultural threads 
with unrestrained glee in the belief that change is al-ways superior to the status quo. It is easy to destroy a work of artistry. It is much more difficult to restore it.
I propose we chill for a few hundred years — that 
we stop pulling on strings and instead step back to re-flect on what has been created. No new laws, no new patents, no new products. We should allow our exist-ing institutions to adapt to the new climate rather than constantly gasping for air. Imagine what thoughtful discourse could occur if our churches, government and schools could spend a century to reflect rather than sim-ply react.
Yet this could never happen because the modern 
paradigm has already been created. We do not simply desire change, we are addicted to it like a fish to wa-ter. After all, how could organizations like MoveOn.org survive without traditions to burn down? How could academics get funding without new and exotic theses, regardless of their validity?
Most of all, how could the consumer-capitalist ma-
chine keep churning without new shiny products to pla-cate the masses, making them less human and less free? We no longer only alter our culture when alterations are needed. We now change for the sake of change, and that is a scary thing indeed.

   This month, Mitt Romney continued the disturbing and 
growing trend of attacking higher education when he said that President Barack Obama “spent too much time 
at Harvard.”
  A lot of media attention has been focused on the fact that 
Romney seems to have forgotten that he spent four years at Harvard. That would give him one more year at the big liberal-elitist-producing factory than Obama.
  However, there’s a much bigger problem with what Rom-
ney said than his hypocrisy. Why is higher education being at-tacked? This isn’t just Romney being a politician, nor is it an isolated incident. The attack on higher education has been a growing trend in the Republican Party.
  The trend of attacking higher education started during 
Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, when the Republican National Committee portrayed Obama as a liberally educated elitist. Since then, members of the GOP have gone as far as to associate all forms of higher education with liberal elitism.
  During this election season, Rick Santorum described 
Obama as a “snob” for his own (incorrect) belief that Obama wanted everybody in America to go to college. Santorum said, “There are good, decent men and women who go out and work hard everyday and put their skills to test that aren’t taught by some liberal college professor that (tries) to indoctrinate them.”
  What was the audience’s re-
sponse to Santorum’s rant? Roaring applause.
  Indeed, there is actually a sig-
niﬁ  cant amount of Americans who imagine a university education to be akin to indoctrination by liberal elit-ists — that is, professors.
  Perhaps the politicians who attack higher education feel 
they have to do so to win supporters. Or maybe they think they need to keep their supporters as uneducated as possible to ensure future victories for their parties. Either way , the highly educated should not brush aside these delusions about higher education.
  The beneﬁ  ts of an education are so self-evident that these 
attacks feel more bizarre than anything. However, we must remember that a signiﬁ  cant amount of Americans agree with the attacks Santorum and other Republican politicians make on education, and thus they should not be disregarded.
  The harsh truth is that it will be difﬁ  cult to change the anti-
intellectualism of Americans who antagonize higher education. That is why all Americans should aspire for their children to re-ceive some form of higher education — to help them learn how to think critically and for themselves, and to prevent the next generation of Americans from becoming unthinking people who accept whatever their preferred politician says through the television.
  I know an education does not ensure wisdom, and I know 
a person can become well-learned without a university edu-cation. I also know that having everyone receive higher edu-cation is an unrealistic goal because social, economic and per-sonal circumstances will inevitably prevent many people from attending college.
  However, no one should be criticized for being highly edu-
cated, and other politicians should not let criticism on higher education slide. This is anti-intellectualism and antagonism taken one step too far. We can’t rely on the world to educate Americans because the world today consists of television and deceitful politicians.
  Obama and other politicians have to ﬁ  ght the attacks on 
higher education and ensure that this is something all Ameri-cans regard highly.

 Politicians’ attacks on higher education need to stopColumn
   Recently, Google replaced its old An-
droid Market with the shiny, new Google Play. 
While the old Android Market was 
centered (obviously) on Android phones, 
Google Play sits dead-center on the Google toolbar used by PCs and smartphones alike.
  The service offers music, movies, books 
and games in one online marketplace. 
While obviously somewhat aping iTunes, 
Google Play differs in one major way from 
Apple’s mega-lucrative media service: Google Play stores all your media in the cloud, i.e. on the Internet, so you never have to download that song or game or book or whatever you want to have. 
You can simply stream your whatever of 
choice from the Web without ever properly downloading it to your computer.
  Google Play is not the ﬁ  rst cloud-based 
entertainment service. 
Netﬂ  ix and Hulu have transformed the 
entertainment industry with their online, subscription-based video-streaming ser-vices. 
With iCloud, Apple lets users sync media 
across all their newfangled gizmos. 
Netﬂ  ix and Hulu, however, have limited themselves to mov-ies and TV shows, and iCloud does not actually store media 
in the cloud. 
Google Play marks the ﬁ  rst major attempt 
at omni-entertainment streamed strictly from the cloud.
  ICloud is not quivering in its boots quite 
yet. 
Although Google Play talks big, offering 
“millions of songs and books” and “thou-sands of movies,” its selection compared to Apple’s is pretty weak, and users who want e-books or movies will more likely turn to a service built speciﬁ  cally for that medium. 
Competitors can also take comfort in the 
fact that Google’s ambitious side projects of-ten ﬁ  zzle (Who remembers Google Wave?).
  But then, Google has never been a com-
pany to sneeze at. 
If Google Play gets some traction now, it 
could become a formative milestone in mod-ern entertainment, the ﬁ  nal step away from physically having one’s music toward hav-ing a license to hear it.
  Ryan Kindel is a columnist for the Daily 
Trojan at the University of Southern California. 
  Google Play has potential to be ‘milestone’ for entertainmentUWire

  Seminoles starter Scott Sitz came out ag-
gressive, sitting down the Gators in order in the ﬁ  rst inning and escaping bases-loaded jams in the second and third. Meanwhile, lefty Brian Johnson, making a rare midweek start for Florida, was touched up for a home run in the ﬁ  rst inning and another two runs in the third.
  For a while, it appeared UF was destined 
to continue its recent slide. Instead, the bats ﬁ  nally came alive and the pitching settled down, allowing the No. 7 Gators (26-7) to clinch a 6-3 win, their third this season against the top-ranked Seminoles (27-6). 
  “I could honestly tell you, after the ﬁ  rst 
couple years (at UF), it was tough; they really had our number,” catcher Mike Zu-nino said. “To come out and play well against them this year is a good feeling.” Florida easily claimed the teams’ ﬁ  rst meet-ing, winning 9-2 in Gainesville before tak-ing the second meeting 4-1 in Jacksonville. For all but two seniors, Tuesday was the ﬁ  rst time any of the Gators had won a se-
ries against the Semi-noles. 
  With Florida 
struggling of late, 
dropping from the top spot in the national rankings for the ﬁ  rst time all season, coach Kevin O’Sullivan said the team wanted this win as much as it needed it. First step: start-ing Johnson.

 Down 3-0 early on the road against 
top-ranked FSU, Florida coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan was worried that the Semi-noles would keep piling on the runs.
  So naturally, Florida’s skipper went 
to his trusted relievers.
  When O’Sullivan made the call, an 
unlikely candidate emerged from the outﬁ  eld bullpen at Dick Howser Stadi-um: freshman Ryan Harris. 
  “You can only go to the well so many 
times with the same guys over and over,” O’Sullivan said. “Somebody has to step up.”
  On Tuesday night, that somebody 
was Harris. 
  After junior lefty Brian Johnson, a 
staple in Florida’s weekend rotation, put the Gators in an early 3-0 hole, Harris en-tered in the fourth to clean up the mess.
  The little-used pitcher out of Jupiter 
made the most of the opportunity against the nation’s top team, completely shut-ting down the Seminoles’ lineup over the course of three innings in the Gators’ 6-3 win.
  The righty entered the game with just 
six innings pitched on the season, and only one outing that lasted longer than one frame — a two-inning relief appear-ance against Florida Atlantic on March 6. 
  That didn’t matter 
against the Seminoles, though, as Harris looked liked a grizzled veteran against an FSU offense that entered the contest averaging 7.1 runs per game and looked to be well on pace for that and more 
against Florida. 
  Harris tossed three perfect innings 
of relief to earn his ﬁ  rst career win. The three innings were as many as he pitched in his last ﬁ  ve appearances combined. Harris stellar in unlikely 
appearance against ‘Noles
THE BOOTHE REVIEW
    To the 36 University of Florida student-
athletes currently grinding,
  Before we get started, I’ll admit I 
didn’t realize until I was already writing this column that I should be correctly addressing you almost as colleagues and not just people I regularly write about. 
  So, here it goes. Welcome to sports jour-
nalism, Greg Larson, Elizabeth Beisel and Frankie Hammond. 
  You see, as I scanned Twitter yesterday 
morning for the umpteenth time looking for a fresh controversy in college athletics or an interesting angle to opine about, I came across a well-produced YouTube promo and link to your newly unveiled blog: The Gator Grind.
  Immediately, I thought, “Aha! I found it.”  Who do these 36 Florida athletes think they 
are? They’ve started their own sports site that gives notable Gators like Patric Young and Matt Patchan a chance to write about their team and talk about what the daily life of a Division-I basketball or football player is like.
  “But that’s what I’m trying to do every day 
at this paper,” I continued to ramble. “These guys might as well be stealing the beer money right out of my wallet and the junk food off my rarely used kitchen table.”
  Your YouTube video was also misleading. 
At nearly two minutes long, the clip correctly showed Young dunking a basketball and Mi-chelle Moultrie div-ing for a ﬂ  y softball, but I know for a fact that Trey Burton does not complete passes.
  E v e n t u a l l y , 
though, I got over my insecure whining.
  After taking a 
moment to catch my breath and think about what this site could actually mean for UF sports coverage, I realized that an interesting and progressive idea was brewing over at The Gator Grind.
  You might be a new step in sports journal-
ism.
  Currently there are four sources of infor-
mation interested readers can visit to learn about Gators sports at any time: the fan-run blogs, pay sites, traditional print media like the Gainesville Sun and the Alligator and, of course, the University Athletic Association’s GatorZone.com.
  All of these outlets offer ranging perspec-
tives but some can deﬁ  nitely harbor biased coverage.
  While The Gator Grind will deﬁ  nitely be 
written in a ﬁ  rst-person bias, it has the poten-tial to expand the impact we’re seeing each O pen letter to The Gator Grind: 
Your site can be game-changing

Junior catcher Mike Zunino belted a two-run home run in the ﬁ  fth inning Tuesday 
that tied the score at three in Florida’s 6-3 victory against top-ranked Florida State.O’Sullivan
UF Baseballover to our older guys and give 
us a good effort,” O’Sullivan said. “That’s the bottom line. This team needed a win moving forward.”
Although Florida benefited 
from several upperclassmen — Zunino hit the game-tying home run in the fifth and Johnson and Nolan Fontana both added solo shots later — it was the under -
classmen who really stepped up. Johnson was pulled in favor of freshman Ryan Harris in the fourth after allowing two earned runs on six hits, and Harris was flawless in just his eighth appearance. 
Freshman second baseman 
Casey Turgeon’s single ended a frustrating start to the game for the Gators in which they loaded the bases twice in the first three in-nings but failed to plate a run. On the night, Florida stranded 10 base runners and had three thrown out at either third or home. 
“There’s a lot of things that 
happen throughout the nine in-nings that you look back (and say), ‘If we had just done some-thing here or just done something there,’” O’Sullivan said. “No one talks about (the struggles with the bases loaded) because you end up winning 6-3, but those are  things  we do have to improve on.”
After Harris’ three scoreless 
innings, Steven Rodriguez struck out four of five batters faced and Austin Maddox earned the save with 1.2 hitless innings of relief. 
In all, the bullpen combined for 
six innings of one-hit ball, seven strikeouts and zero runs allowed.
“Florida State took an early 3-0 
lead, it was huge,” O’Sullivan said. “We needed to stop their momen-tum. I’m afraid if we don’t do that, they may really take it to us.”

Freshman right-hander Ryan Harris entered in the fourth inning and pitched 
three frames against the No. 1 Seminoles without allowing a run. 
Freshman throws three shutout 
frames in longest outing of season
“In order to win midweek games, there’s al-
ways a guy that comes out of the ‘pen and eats 
up some innings for you and does a really good job,” O’Sullivan said. “Luckily for us, it was Ryan.”
After Florida State’s bats jumped ahead early 
against Johnson, Harris mowed them down. The 6-foot-2 right-hander kept the Seminoles off bal-ance with a steady dose of sinking fastballs low and inside that frequently made contact with the handles of FSU’s bats. 
Harris (1-0, 2.25 ERA) induced eight ground-
ball outs during his outing — including four to third baseman Cody Dent — and didn’t allow a ball to leave the infield between the fourth and sixth innings.
“(I was) just getting out there and throwing it 
down the middle, letting my field do the work,” Harris said. “They did a great job.”
During his trip through the Seminoles’ order, 
Harris threw a career-high 37 pitches, including 21 strikes, while striking out Jose Brizuela to end the sixth inning. He was also the only Florida pitcher to retire FSU junior second baseman De-von Travis, who finished 3 for 4 at the plate and a triple shy of the cycle.
Harris’ three perfect innings kept FSU in 
check while UF’s offense came back and took the lead. His outing also highlighted a six-inning shutout effort by Florida’s stout bullpen.
“It was big for Ryan to come in and put up 
zeroes … it was huge,” catcher Mike Zunino said. “It stopped momentum. We were able to piece together a couple of at-bats and get some back. He continued to do what he was doing and got it to our big dogs in the end.”

It’s an exciting prospective to 
think these players can add to the spectrum of UF sports cover -
age through their own unfiltered analysis. Some are certainly qual-ified. Several of the athletes who have leadership or writing posi-tions at the site are also working on degrees from the College of Journalism and Communica-tions.
The only hesitation I have 
as an interested and concerned reader, however, is the question of oversight.
Is this site truly your own or 
will its stories be tempered and tamed by the UAA’s administra-tion and its public relations staff?
If the latter is true, it’s a 
shame. The Gator Grind has a chance to not only make a fan out of me, but potentially thousands of readers. It can be much more than a cute project with brief blog posts.
I’d love to read an athlete’s 
fleshed out thoughts and reac-tions to individual games, coach-ing changes and NCAA rules and issues. It would also be great to see them responding to any in-accuracies in media coverage of their teams.
So here’s me saying good 
luck to everyone involved at The Gator Grind. I can’t wait to read about Florida sports through your perspective.

This is nothing new for Sami Fagan.
For the second time this season, the 
freshman third baseman was named Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Week prior to  Florida’s matchup against UCF on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m.
The award comes on the heels of Fa-
gan’s best offensive effort so far this sea-son. In three games against Ole Miss and one against No. 21 Florida State, Fagan knocked in seven runs, including her first home run of the year in Tallahassee.
But for Fagan, racking up accolades 
won’t change her as a player.
“It doesn’t really affect me that much,” 
she said. “I appreciate the award but I’m still going to be doing everything I have been doing the exact same way. We came in here doing the same thing we’ve been doing since the summer. So we’re just playing how we’ve always played.”
However, Fagan’s play has actually 
improved since she won the award back on Feb. 19. The freshman from Dunnellon ranks second among active Gators with a .370 batting average and 47 hits. And now the speedy, hit-for-contact leadoff hitter has shown her power and ability to knock in runs this past week.
Fagan has hit more than a third of her 
20 RBI in the last four games. She had at least one RBI in every game last week while totaling five hits and six runs.
But Fagan isn’t the only Florida fresh-
man worthy of conference accolades.
Lauren Haeger knows what it takes to 
win a collegiate award, having garnered a team-high three SEC Freshman of the Week honors. Though five of UF’s nine conference and national awards this sea-son have come from the two freshmen, neither of them has grown overconfident. 
Haeger said she and Fagan have suc-
cessfully avoided that. 
“My head has never gotten big from 
that,” she said. “We’re just the same. We’re always just ourselves. It is always nice to get your name out there but it re-ally doesn’t affect us on the field.”
And it’s not just Haeger and Fagan pull-
ing the load for the freshman class.
Bailey Castro has a chance to become 
the third award-winning freshman on the team thanks to her recent success. 
She hit three homers over the weekend, 
including two on Sunday in a seven-RBI performance that tied the UF single-game RBI record.
“I think Bailey will win that award, def-
initely,” Haeger said. “She is a great hitter and it’s so great to have her back in our lineup and doing well, getting back to her normal self.”
Earning the honor after being sidelined 
with a leg injury earlier this season would not only exemplify Castro’s power, but her perseverance as well.
“It would be a good accomplishment,” 
Castro said. “I’m just trying to do good for the team and if it comes it would be great. Everyone always hopes to win something, so it would be nice if it happens.”
Coach Tim Walton is perhaps the 
proudest of the success the freshmen have had this season. After all, he’s the one who brought everyone to Gainesville in the first place.
“I’m sure he’s very proud of us,” Hae-
ger said. “I think he thinks it’s great that we win this stuff because it gets us recog-nized and gets our names out there and to let people know that we are a bunch of freshmen, but we can play.”Fagan grabs second weekly award ahead of UCF matchupWEDNESDAY, APRIL 11, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Freshman Kiersten Wang scored a career-high 9.875 on vault in the 
NCAA Regionals — her first time competing in the event since Jan. 20. 
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
 
Kiersten Wang finally got her 
opportunity to shine Saturday. 
With senior Nicole Ellis sitting 
out vault with a hip injury, coach 
Rhonda Faehn needed to find someone who could step into El-lis’ No. 2 role. 
Faehn decided to roll with 
Wang, a freshman who trained well at UF’s regional practice ses-sion.  
“I didn’t know I was compet-
ing until training day,” Wang said. “They wanted to see if me or Jamie (Shisler) would be the better pick for our team. I was lucky to get the opportunity to compete. I was in shock.” 
For No. 1 Florida, Wang’s per -
formance was a pleasant surprise. On the biggest stage of her young collegiate career, she recorded a season-best 9.875 on vault. Her score was a key factor in the Gators’ impressive vault total of 49.55 at NCAA Regionals. 
“It was a different experi-
ence,” Wang said. “Honestly, all I thought about was what I have been doing in practice, which is to pay attention to the good lay-out before you twist. At the end, I thought about what Rhonda’s been telling me about the solid landing and keeping my hips flat, so I would catch the landing.”
Wang’s moxie on vault moti-
vated Florida’s four all-around competitors. 
Junior Ashanée Dickerson 
and sophomore Alaina Johnson shared the event title (9.95) after sticking their landings.
 Junior Marissa King (9.875) 
and freshman Kytra Hunter (9.9) also hit their vault routines. 
“To see her go out and hit her 
vault like she’s done in the gym was exciting,” Dickerson said. “It gave me a boost of energy to do the same.”
Before Saturday, Wang had 
not performed on vault since Jan. 20 exhibition against Kentucky. Her last non-exhibition competi-tion was a week earlier. In two lineup appearances and one ex-hibition on vault in January, she averaged a 9.72. 
“I know she struggled a little 
bit at the beginning of the season just with her body feeling tired,” King said. “She wasn’t used to the conditioning and the num-bers we do here.” 
Injuries also hindered Wang’s 
progress early this year. In Feb-ruary, she pulled her left quad, which kept her out of vault train-ing for almost a month. 
After her quad began feeling 
better, she suffered a sprained left ankle a week before the Southeastern Conference Cham-pionships. 
“She’s kind of had a rough go 
of it this year. It’s been a big tran-sition for her,” Faehn said. “For her within a week and a half to transition into the vault lineup and perform really well, I’m proud of her not giving up.
“She competed the way she 
was training. She didn’t let the pressure or being on the regional stage make her more nervous.”
Faehn said Tuesday that she 
doubts Ellis will see action at vault during the NCAA Cham-pionships on April 20, although the decision will be based on the results of an MRI on her hip. 
If Ellis is a no-go, Faehn said 
Wang would likely see vault again when the Gators compete in Duluth, Ga. 
“I hope Nicole comes back, 
but it would be awesome for Ki-ersten to do a vault, too,” King said. “It’s a debate, and whoever goes in, we’ll support them 100 percent.”
