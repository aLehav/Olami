About 125 people of diverse religions, ages and rac-
es gathered in front of the Dove World Outreach Center 
Wednesday evening for a prayer vigil in response to a 
sign recently posted by the center. 
The sign reads “Islam is of the Devil” and was 
placed Sunday in the church’s front lawn. It was van-
dalized and torn down that evening but was re-erected 
on Monday, said Terry Jones, the pastor at the church. 
Nicolette Guerrero, a UF sopho-
more who was present at the vigil, 
said she came to send a message to 
the church that posted the sign. 
“If we keep going on with this, 
maybe they won’t post another one,” Guerrero said. 
Jones said that the church, located at 5805 NW 37th 
St., does not plan on taking down the sign, and that more messages will be displayed in the future.
“We think we are losing our heritage as a Christian 
nation,” Jones said as one of the reasons the church put up the sign.
Jones said Islam’s growing popularity in the United 
States needs to be addressed because Christians are not 
standing up for what they believe in.Pastor: Sign 
will stay up

The Florida Bright Futures Schol-
arship Program will not raise funds 
to cover the tuition hikes coming this fall after undergoing several changes made by the Florida Legislature.
When UF increases its tuition from 
$125.91 per credit hour to $145.76 per credit hour, Bright Futures will con-tinue to award $126 per credit hour to Academic Scholar winners and $95 per credit hours to Medallion Scholar winners, according to the Bright Fu-tures Web site.Students will now have to pay UF 
the difference of what Bright Futures doesn’t cover, said Rick Wilder, asso-ciate director for UF Student Finan-cial Affairs.  
This will cost students who once 
received 100 percent tuition about $237 per semester if they are regis-tered for 12 credit hours, the mini-mum amount of credit hours required to be a full-time student, he said. 
Florida Prepaid and other forms 
of financial aid  can be used to cover the difference in costs, he said.Bright Futures drops

After  plagiarizing passages from The 
New York Times in four of her news stories, 
a UF student was fired Tuesday from her in-
ternship at The Colorado Springs Gazette.
Rising junior Hailey Mac Arthur could 
face expulsion from the College of Journalism 
and Communications if the college’s investi-
gation confirms the plagiarism, said William 
McKeen, chair of the journalism department.
Mac Arthur formerly wrote for The In-
dependent Florida Alligator and interned at The Gainesville Sun.
Journalism and Communications Dean 
John Wright said in an interview that journal-ism students are repeatedly warned against plagiarism.
“For the life of me, I don’t see how this 
kind of thing could happen in this day and age,” he said. “Even if the person felt com-pelled to do something so dishonest... I’m totally baffled.”
News of the firing  reached blogs and The 
Associated Press stories by Tuesday night. 
Some journalism professors received  e-mails 
about the incident on Wednesday morning, prompting them to quickly and firmly an-nounce the college’s stance against plagia-
rism in classes and on Facebook, Twitter and 
blogs.
Tuesday afternoon, Wright posted on his 
Facebook status, “One thing is certain. Pla-giarism will not be tolerated at the College of Journalism and Communications.” 
The Fine Print, a progressive maga-
zine designed for UF students, was 
deemed Best New Publication of the Year by Campus Progress Wednesday at a conference in Washington, D.C. 
Speakers included former president 
Bill Clinton, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, “The Daily Show” writer and cor-respondent John Oliver and White House green jobs adviser Van Jones.
“This award is just complete valida-tion for what we’ve been doing,” said Jes-sica Newman, co-editor of the magazine and UF journalism senior. “It’s quite a shock. It’s been really inspirational.” 
Along with co-editor Lydia Fiser, 
Newman decided to start The Fine Print to use as a sounding board for students to express their thoughts and “build a uni-fied force,” she said.

Saudi Arabia convicts 300 al-Qaida suspects 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) 
— A Saudi criminal court has 
convicted and sentenced an al-
Qaida militant to death and given more than 300 others jail terms, fines and travel bans in the 
country’s first known terrorism 
trials for suspected members of 
the terror network, officials said Wednesday.
A Justice Ministry spokesman 
said the court looked into 179 cas-
es involving the 330 defendants 
found guilty.
The spokesman did not give 
any details on the person sen-
tenced to death, but his punish-
ment suggests he could be a se-

PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) — 
The U.S. Coast Guard is search-A Flagler County Sheriff’s Of-
fice spokeswoman says deputies arrested Donnie Hendrix at his home Tuesday. Hendrix served 
4 1/2 years in prison for running 
an illegal silicone injection op-eration after a 53-year-old Miami 
woman died in 2001.
According to a news release, 
the 40-year-old man charged $400 
to $600 for silicone injections that he gave patients at his house.
Hendrix faces two charges of 
practicing medicine without a li-
cense and practicing as a health 
care professional without a li-cense.
Hendrix was released 
Wednesday on $30,000 bail.ing for five people whose plane crashed in the Gulf of Mexico.
Authorities say the plane 
went down about 20 miles west 
of Port Richey Wednesday af-
ternoon.

■ IT IS SCHEDULED TO BE 
COMPLETED IN APRIL.
By ALEX CHACHKEVITCH
Alligator Writer
A ceremony Monday will offi-
cially kick off construction on a new 
administrative building on UF’s Eastside Campus.Construction of the office build-
ing began last week and is scheduled to be completed in April, according to Ed Poppell, UF’s vice president for business affairs. 
The total cost for the three-story, 
82,000-square-foot building will be about $15 million.
Poppell said the building will 
accommodate seven UF adminis-trative departments, including the Florida Center for Library Automa-tion, Division of Continuing Educa-tion and Public Health. In addition, it 
will provide about 300 new jobs within the 
departments housed 
in the building.
The new jobs will contribute to 
economic revitalization efforts in East Gainesville, Poppell said.
The structure is part of UF’s plan to expand the Eastside Campus.
The building will also be Gold 
Certified, the second-highest sus-tainability standard set by the Lead-ership in Energy and Environmental 
Design Green Building Rating Sys-
tem, according to a press release. 
Poppell said the College of En-
gineering and other workers devel-oped ideas for the structure as early as 2001 after UF acquired the prop-erty. Actual construction planning didn’t start until about six months ago.  
President Bernie Machen will 
speak at the ceremony along with 
Poppell, City Commissioner Scher-
win Henry and County Commis-sioner Rodney Long. 
The ceremony will be held at the 
construction site, 2124 NE Waldo Road., at 9 a.m. Monday.sTudEnT LIfE
$15M building to accomodate seven UF departmentsBy THOMAs s TEWART

If UF officials have their way, it may be a 
little harder to get drunk at the next UF-Geor-gia football showdown, which has been held in Jacksonville since 1933.
Officials, including UF President Bernie 
Machen, have asked Jacksonville to imple-ment a number of changes for this year’s game, many of which will affect The Jackson-ville Landing, a strip of restaurants and shops on the Jacksonville waterfront, and other areas populated with fans from the game.
The requests include limiting the number 
of people at the Landing to levels approved by the fire marshal, halving the number of 
locations that sell alcohol, banning the sale of 
shots, increasing enforcement of alcohol laws and sponsoring places for students to go in-stead of the Landing, among other requests.
According to a Landing spokeswoman, an 
unfair proportion of the changes focus on the strip where fans flock to party before and after the game. 
 The requests were included in a letter sent 
late last month to Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton.
Machen and UF’s Vice President of Student 
Affairs Patricia Telles-Irvin signed the letter, which says that little progress has been made in preventing the conditions that caused two 
student deaths, one in 2004 and in 2005.
Both students were intoxicated and had be-
come separated from their friends because of 
the crowds, the letter stated.
Also, citing budget cuts, the letter asks that 
the city pick up the entire tab for the student safety zones where students can get things like food, medical attention and directions.
UF has paid about $11,000 a year to run its 
share of the zones, which includes costs for ho-tel rooms for the 20 to 25 UF volunteers who staff the zones, according to Dave Kratzer, UF’s associate vice president for Student Af-fairs and Capt. Jeff Holcomb, University Police Department spokesman.
Adam Hollingsworth, chief of staff in the 
Jacksonville mayor’s office, said the city is re-searching how feasible UF’s requests are. Hol-lingsworth said the city is considering issues like whether it can tell businesses not to serve alcohol in a specific form, like shots.
He said it’s not clear how much the changes 
would cost the city but said it should be minimal.
The city is determined to 
work with UF and the Uni-versity of Georgia to keep them happy and keep fans safe, he said.
“The Florida-Georgia 
game is a longstanding tra-dition in Jacksonville, and 
it’s our desire to keep this game for a long, long time,” he said.
According to Michael Bouda, Jacksonville’s 
manager of sports and entertainment, the vis-iting fans bring in about $25 million to $30 mil-lion each year.
The universities also profit from the game.Each year, the universities make about $1.5 
million to $2 million more each year in ticket revenues than they would if the game rotated from Athens to Gainesville, said UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes.
Rachel Nudge, spokeswoman for the Land-
ing, said she believes the proposed changes would likely increase security costs for the Landing and decrease revenues for some of the vendors.
For example, keeping crowds in the court-
yard and balcony areas to 2,500 — the fire marshal’s limit — would be difficult, espe-cially with 100,000 people visiting the Landing from Friday to Sunday, she said.
She said the Landing has taken steps to 
increase safety over the last few years. The changes, like moving the stage with live music from the inner courtyard to a city street out-side the facility in order to spread the crowd 
out, cost about $50,000 a year on top of their 
normal security measures.
“Because this is the hot spot during this 
event, because everyone likes to come here, they’re pointing the finger at us,” Nudge said.
“We’ve never had a serious incident here 
during Florida-Georgia. We’ve gotta be doing something right.”

Robert Hahn, of Nazareth, Pa., and his wife Catherine look at pieces at the Voicing Indigenous ARTifacts 
exhibit at the Harn Museum of Art Wednesday.
By PATRICK ANNESTY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Ceremonial items, which were 
seized as illegally exported goods 
made from endangered species, 
are on display at the Samuel P. 
Harn Museum of Art.
On Tuesday, the museum de-
buted its “Voicing Indigenous AR-Tifacts: Amazonian Featherwork” exhibit, showcasing nine pieces, including headdresses, masks and necklaces used by six Brazilian na-tive groups as ritual adornments 
and social status symbols. The ex-
hibit runs through Sept. 15.
The Harn’s Director of Public 
Relations and Marketing Tami Wroath said that while presenting the artifacts as works of art, the museum will also highlight the is-sue of the illegal trade of wildlife products.
The nine exhibit pieces, made 
from feathers of endangered spe-cies, were part of a seizure of more than 2,500 Amazonian objects by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 2003. Wroath said the objects were exported in violation of five international and domestic treaties.
“In May of 2005, the confiscated 
objects were donated to the Florida Museum of Natural History under the condition that the collection would be used for educational purposes,” she said.
Anthropology graduate student 
Sonia Duin will give a presentation July 19 at 3 p.m. that will discuss how the objects were used in Ama-zonian culture and the problems that arise from illegal exportation.
“The material culture of indig-
enous people depends on a num-ber of species that are considered endangered,” she said. “Feathered accessories in particular are a criti-cal element of how native peoples interact with their social and reli-gious world.”Art display features

� AT LEAST 2,500 MORE STUDENTS 
ARE ENROLLED DURING SUMMER B.
By ABBIE PARKER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students may have been able to hear a 
pin drop in the Reitz Union during Summer 
A, but things are picking up, with an event 
scheduled nearly every day of Summer B.According to the Office of Admissions, 
at least 2,500 more students are enrolled in 
Summer B than Summer A. This is because freshmen do not have the option of starting 
UF before Summer B.
According to the Reitz Union Board Pres-
ident Kristen Huff, clubs and organizations 
would rather spend money when students can reap the most benefits. 
According to Reitz Director of Opera-
tions Mike Mironack, some organizations’ budgets force them to choose between spon-soring activities Summer A or Summer B, Mironack said. 
“Our budget doesn’t cover for us to have 
activities Summer A and Sum-mer B,” Huff said. “If we could have more events, like in Sum-mer A, we would.” 
“If there wasn’t anything 
going on at the Reitz, I would probably just stay home and watch TV,” said Lauren Mayo, a freshman who lives on campus. 
Mayo attended the Summer with RUB 
Entertainment comedy show at the Reitz Fri-day night, which was followed by a show-
ing of the recent comedy film “I Love You, 
Man,” and a concert featuring local bands. 
“[My roommate and I] go to campus 
events when we hear about them,” Mayo said.

Celebrity proves a distraction to votersDarts & Laurels
In case you missed the Michael Jackson memorial concert on, 
you know, every channel ever, the Department of Darts & Laurels would like to point out that it was a hell of a show.
Everyone from Brooke Shields to John Mayer to “random 
politician we had never heard of” showed up to pay their re-
spects and relate how Jackson touched them (over the clothes 
only) during his mysterious and abbreviated life. Overall the service was appropriately at the nexus of “celebratory” and “re-spectful.”
Oh, and then there was the Rev. Al Sharpton.For talking about the deceased pop star like he was Martin 
Luther King Jr. and Jesus all rolled into one, we would like to tactfully place a cork, or at least a claiming-Obama-got-elected-only-because-of-“Thriller”-takes-hyperbole-to-a-whole-new-
level DART into the mouth of the Reverend in hopes that he 
will keep his patently overblown theories and hallucinations to 
his radio talk show (ironically titled “Keepin’ it Real”).
Howard Monoian was a WWII hero in Sainte-Mère-Église, 
France where a plaque was erected in his honor. Too bad he spent the entire war behind the front line. Monoian, who fre-quently boasted of his bravery in combat, has been exposed as a fraud at the ripe old age of 84. 
Military records obtained by the Boston Herald reveal that 
Monoian spent most of the war monitoring a supply dump. His biggest injury? A broken middle finger. In England. On standby. For undermining the bravery of the troops who actually para-chuted into the midst a fierce battle, the Editorial Board would like to extend a we’ll-show-you-a-middle-finger-or-six DART  
to the deceitful D-Dayer. 
To complete the triumvirate of similarly-themed condem-
nations, the Editorial Board would like to send a why-are-you-destroying-the-credibility-of-our-college DART to Hailey Mac 
Arthur, the UF journalism student who blew up the AP wire with accounts of her plagiarism. Not only did Mac Arthur cre-ate a stigma against our beloved J-School (thanks, because as if finding internships wasn’t hard enough already, now we come from ‘that school’), she disappointed the peers and professors who previously held her in high esteem. And, not only did Mac Arthur foolishly disregard advice from professors (you know, about telling the truth and stuff), she disregarded common sense (stealing from The New York Times must have seemed 
like a great idea since no one ever reads that.) 
At a time like this, it’s important to commend good, solid 
journalism. For that, the Editorial Board would like to hand a 
congratulatory LAUREL to the staff of The Fine Print. Jessica 
Newman and Lydia Fiser, the publication’s editors, recently re-ceived the award of “Best New Publication of the Year” from Campus Progress, the nationally recognized non-profit.
For us, the thought of Gator Growl does not conjure the best 
of memories. For listening to a student poll and selecting Dana 
Carvey to be in the 2009 performance, we would like to extend 
a tentative here’s-to-hoping-this-will-be-’excellent!’ LAUREL to 
the Gator Growl staff. Seriously guys, if this is as bad as the last 
two years, we might go into post-traumatic stress. Now if only we could get one of the bands that was slated to be at Wayne-stock, we might be in good shape.
Because people who pay more than a dollar for a serving 
of the most abundant resource on Earth might need a little bit more than common sense to send them in the right direction, 
the Department of Darts & Laurels would like to send a time-to-
call-our-parents-and-tell-them-to-set-an-embargo-on-bottled-water-at-our-houses LAUREL to both the Government Ac-
countability Office and the Environmental Working Group. 
Working in conjunction with each other, the two groups are pushing for Americans to make bottled water a “distant sec-ond choice” to filtered tap water. Apparently, the differences 
between the two are nill, despite previous misconceptions that 
Zephyrhills flows directly from Mt. Olympus into the bottle (passing under the feet of unicorns, of course). 
That’s all for this week. Stay safe and don’t drink the Kool-
Aid (if it’s made with bottled water).

OPINIONS EDITORAl Franken is a funny guy. He is also intelligent and 
seems to understand the needs of his constituents. And Franken seems earnest in his desire to be a U.S. 
Senator. But despite all this, he should not have run for the position.
Celebrity status like Franken’s clearly has an impact on 
an election because it shrouds what’s most important — the issues. It gives stars an unfair advantage compared to other 
politicians who don’t have the same exposure to the pub-
lic eye. Celebrities need to stay out of political office so that America can elect the best people to serve in office — not the most famous.Franken is merely the latest in a line of celebrities who have become major politicians — a group that includes Ronald Reagan, Sonny Bono, Jesse Ventura, Jack Kemp and Arnold Schwarzenegger. And Franken is following in the footsteps of a set of civil servants who have produced uninspired 
results.
This is not to say Franken has no shot at becoming a good 
— or even great — senator. He’s an intelligent man. He grad-
uated cum laude from Harvard in 1973 with a degree in po-litical science. But talking and writing about politics is very different from holding political office, and only time will tell if he can be successful. Also, he’s going to have to break a 
strong trend of mediocrity that his celebrity predecessors 
have created.
Unfortunately, the failures of elected celebrities have yet 
to turn off Americans to the idea of electing them. Instead, Americans have come to embrace the idea of celebrities in politics. Franken is the latest proof of that, winning by the narrowest of margins in last year’s Minnesota Senate race. Franken isn’t an A-lister like the Governator or Sonny Bono, 
but his notoriety as an author and comedian was doubtlessly 
a factor in his win over incumbent senator Norm Coleman.
Ironically, Coleman was no stranger to facing a celebrity 
in an election. Coleman lost Minnesota’s gubernatorial race to former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura in 1998. Cole-man then defeated former vice presi-dent and one-time Minnesota senator Walter Mondale to win his Senate seat in 2002.
In the Senate, many considered Coleman a very capable 
politician. Coleman’s term was widely regarded as a success-ful one, and his work on legislation for renewable energy and rural infrastructure helped serve the needs of Minnesotans. 
The voters hardly had reason to remove him from office — 
but they did, and they replaced him with a celebrity. Some-thing’s wrong when Coleman was able to defeat a former vice president, but not a comedian.
The first celebrity governor, Ronald Reagan, started this 
trend for awful celebrity politicians back in the 1960s. His star power eventually led him to run for president, where America decided that it was in fact a good idea to elect a red-scare xenophobe.
As expected, Ventura and Schwarzenegger’s reigns as 
governors have not been without controversy and criticism. The media attacked Ventura at nearly every turn for his ab-surd number of vetoes and odd political viewpoints. Their relentless criticism is largely considered a reason why he lasted only one term in office. And Schwarzenegger’s perfor-mance has been inconsistent at best, with his notable failure 
occurring when all four ballot measures he sponsored in a 
2005 special election were defeated.
From Reagan to Schwarzenegger to Ventura, America 
has given celebrities their chance to try and positively im-pact government. For the most part, they’ve failed miser-ably. While Franken provides another chance for a celebrity to succeed, any success of his will only encourage another knucklehead to become the next celebrity politician — like 
NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, who continuously de-
clares his desire to run for governor of Alabama.
The U.S. voters need to stop falling for these gimmicks 
and elect those who truly can serve our nation.

Machen’s requests overstep boundaries
Recently President Machen sent a letter to the city of Jack-
sonville outlining key changes that need to be made by the 
city for the annual UF-Georgia game to continue being held in Jacksonville. 
As a 27-year-old student I am outraged at one of the 
stipulations: the ban on liquor shots. With all due respect to President Machen, who does he think he is? Trying to be the moral authority for students who are of legal drinking age and not in Gainesville let alone on campus, is absurd and ludicrous.
It’s one thing if the president of the UF wants to curtail 
what goes on at the campus, it’s a whole other issue when he tries to regulate what students do when they are nearly 100 miles away in another city.
Machen has overstepped his bounds as an administrator 
of a higher-learning institution to a level I don’t think has been seen before. So what’s the end game here? Will Ma-chen single-handedly end a longstanding tradition because he didn’t get his way, like a child who takes his ball home 
because he didn’t get picked for the game?
I hope the city of Jacksonville has enough fortitude to tell 
this guy, “You will not tell us what to do in our own city.”
Moreover, I hope I am not alone in my outrage when it 
comes to the university (particularly Machen) telling me 
what I can and can’t do outside of school, especially when it’s not reckless or illegal.
If Jacksonville succumbs to Machen’s pressure it will 
likely set the precedent for his moral authority agenda to  
have an ever wider local effect.

College degrees mean little without ambition to back them Guest column
Most people who go to college do so 
not because they enjoy sitting in stuffy lecture halls while listening to 
monotone-voiced professors, but so they can 
carve out a better place for themselves in the 
world when they graduate. Or at least, that’s 
what most expect.
Therefore, there are plenty of indifferent 
college students floating through the motions. This same indifference will continue after graduation as they wonder why no employer calls after submitting résumés to Monster.com or CareerBuilder black holes.
A new study from the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston found that college graduates who take jobs below their education level not only earn less, but also trail the earnings of other gradu-ates who were able to secure career-track em-
ployment upon graduation.
Students who settle are the ones simply  
taking classes and don’t have  a clear focus of 
where they want to end up after graduation. Some go to school blindly with no major and hope that eventually they’ll fall into a cushy job just because they went to college. What a stupidly expensive and risky proposition.
Take just a few examples of people I’ve encountered. One stu-dent finished her asso-ciate’s degree at the lo-cal community college. 
She says she wants to be a nurse, but none of 
her classes fulfilled the nursing pre-requisites. 
Now she’s discouraged that she wasted two years pursuing a degree that isn’t quite what she needs. A communication student is look-ing for an internship. He  said the bad economy 
is preventing him from finding a job, but the truth is, he hasn’t networked or made an effort to secure an internship. He has the secret hope that someone will just call and offer a job.You have to plan ahead and take responsi-
bility. You can’t leave your future up to naive wishing that things will turn out because you showed up. Find a mentor, a career counselor, a professional who can help coach and guide 
you through the obstacles of getting where 
you want to go.
In the end, there is no one to blame for your 
failures and disappointments except yourself. Too many people are trapped in a state of in-difference to develop the necessary problem solving skills to compete in the world.

A man is separated from his 
wife.
As he desperately tries to come 
to her aid, she is raped and beaten 
by citizens of her own country.
Her screams of pain subside, 
and she gives up.
One final blow to the head 
ends her life, and her husband, helpless, is left with the memo-ries of her final gaze of despera-tion.
This is one of many stories 
students from the UF’s School of Theatre and Dance re-created in “Where Can We Run? Use Your Words!” 
The educational performance 
was inspired by the people of Rugerero, a 500-person vil-lage near the western border of Rwanda. The actors performed to 105 people when the show opened Wednesday in the sold-out McGuire Pavilion’s Black Box Theatre. The performance runs until Sunday.
After a two-week trip to 
Rwanda, the students in the play were able to recreate the stories of the 1994 genocide that left 80 percent of the country without an immediate family member and 
56 percent of children witness to 
a killing, according to the United 
Nations Children’s Fund. The performance includes portions of a documentary made on the trip.
In March, four students from 
the School of Theatre and Dance and six nursing students traveled to Rugerero. In a town hall meet-ing, UF representatives asked if they could share knowledge on health care, theater and art with the villagers.“We were thrilled that our 
idea fit their interest,“ said Jill Sonke, director of the Center for the Arts in Healthcare Research and Education. “It was an incred-ibly warm welcome and really touching to be well-received in another culture.”
Prior to the trip, the UF stu-
dents raised money to provide health insurance to the villagers at $2 a year per person.
For the next two weeks, volun-
teers taught the villagers hygiene techniques, such as how to avoid infection and clean wounds. 
Through acting, villagers ex-
pressed emotions about their past and gained an appreciation for art and theater.
“It took a lot to assimilate to 
the recent history of genocide in that culture,” Sonke said. “I think they learned that theater is really fun, and engaging in creative ac-tivities can enhance your overall well-being.”
UF students also learned much 
from the people of Rwanda.
“There is no way to describe 
how we felt after the trip,” said Rachael Jones, a UF junior and actress in the performance. “It was very life changing and very moving.”
In the theater, audience mem-
bers learn how genocide reshaped Rwanda and about the estimated 800,000 who were killed in just 100 days, according to PBS.org.“The underlying theme of this 
whole thing is not just an hour 
and 40 minutes of watching,” 
said Nick Greene, a senior in the School of Theatre and Dance and actor in the performance. “It’s a 
learning experience.”
The performance parallels the 
genocide in Rwanda to the killing 
of 36 school children in Chicago’s South Side in 2009. The actors compare the widely overlooked killings to cases such as the death of Caylee Anthony in Central Florida, which received national coverage.
“Hopefully, we’ll have some 
eye-opening experiences for ev-eryone,” Jones said after her per-
formance. “I think it will be hard 
for audiences to not be moved in 
some way.”
The performance concludes 
with a question-and-answer ses-
sion between audience members 
and the cast.
“I was very impressed by the 
individual performances by all 
of the actors,” said Chase Den Beste, a sophomore telecommu-nications major. “I immediately went on Facebook and invited all of my friends to go see it.”
The director, Mikell Pinkney, 
hopes the play will help people understand the healing involved after the Rwandan genocide.
“This is definitely a time for 
enlightenment and awareness,”  Pinkney said. “We’re going to have to go through that process to forget about the past and move 
ahead to live in peace and har-
mony.”
Tickets are $14 for the general 
public and $10 for students and 
senior citizens. They can be pur-chased at ticketmaster.com or at the University Box Office located in the lobby of the Constans The-atre. Nightly performances will run until Saturday at 7:30 p.m., with  matinees at 2 p.m. on Satur-day and Sunday.

■ THE ADJUSTMENT COULD
GENERATE ABOUT $1.5 MILLION.
By SHELBY NEICHOY
Alligator Contributing Writer
City Hall may depend on money from 
property owners to handle its budget short-falls, which was announced during a press conference held Tuesday afternoon con-cerning the 2010 budget.
 “In January of this year we began to re-
assess our expenditures and our revenues,” City Manager Russ Blackburn said, “And we saw… that we were going to be experi-encing some fairly significant changes from 
what we expected.” 
As a way to counteract the estimated 
$7.2 million deficit, Blackburn recommend-
ed raising Gainesville property taxes. 
The proposal included increasing the millage rate from 4.2544 to 4.5297. This will 
raise property taxes by $41 per year for an 
owner of a $200,000 
home. The city esti-mates that the adjust-ment will generate an 
additional $1.5 million.  
A small increase in property tax may 
mean big adjustments for some large prop-erty owners, according to George Edwards, owner of “Gainesville Apartment and Con-dominium Guide.” 
In order to counteract increasing costs, 
property owners may raise rental rates. 
“As costs are increased, owners have to 
do something to make up the difference,” he said.
Edwards said the city needs to come up 
with other ways to deal with the deficit.
“I think this is a bad idea,” he said. “The 
government should learn to live within their means like you and I have to.”
Church posted sign to preserve Christianity from Islamic influence
“To be a Christian, you would 
have to agree with that sign,” Jones 
said.
He said the sign is not meant to 
attack individuals but to attack the 
religion of Islam because it is op-
pressive and violent.
Leila Aamir is one of several 
Muslims who attended the vigil. 
She said she came to the United 
States two months ago from Paki-
stan to give her children a better 
life. 
She attended the vigil because 
she wanted to show that Muslims 
are not hateful, but peaceful and 
loving, she said.
“Like Christians we also hate 
the devil,” she said. “We are not of the devil.” 
Ismail ibn Ali, president of Is-
lam on Campus at UF, said in an 
e-mail that he hopes non-Muslims 
who read the sign will Google “Is-
lam” and see what the religion is 
about before making judgments. 
“Even though they are allowed 
to post a sign based on our beloved First Amendment, this is not an ac-
tion which brings understanding 
and only misinforms people about the religion of Islam,” Ali said.
He said he hopes everyone who 
is offended by the sign will peace-
fully ask the Dove World Outreach 
Center to remove it. 
“I am glad to see that people 
from other religious backgrounds are also deeply disturbed,” he 
said.Eve MacMaster, pastor at Em-
manuel Mennonite Church who 
organized the prayer vigil, said she 
wants people in the community to 
know most Christians do not agree 
with the message that the Dove 
World Outreach Center is sending by posting the sign. 
“It troubles me that my faith 
is represented by such a negative message,” MacMaster said. 
She said she sent an e-mail 
about the vigil to her congrega-tion, members of Campus Minis-
try Cooperative, pastors from local 
churches as well as personal Jew-
ish and Muslim friends.
“We decided that the most ap-
propriate response was to meet in 
prayer,” she said.
She is concerned for the people 
in the Gainesville community as well as the congregation and pas-
tors of the Dove World Outreach 
Center, she said.
“It’s not a good thing for our 
community to have a sign that shows that much hatred,” she 
said. 
The sign was brought to Mac-
Master’s attention by a fellow member of United Voices for 
Peace, Scott Camil, who received 
a call from a woman in tears after seeing the sign, Camil said. 
She called after the police had 
told her that it was a matter of free speech and nothing could be done 
about the sign, he said.
“When she told me what the 
sign said, I couldn’t even believe it,” he said.
He said he believes there should 
be tolerance for different types of 
people and religions and doesn’t 
understand why a church would post that type of sign.
Like MacMaster, Camil said he 
is concerned about the sign’s effect 
on the community and said he be-
lieves it is below the community’s standard for decency.
“I really thought the sign rep-
resented hate speech, bigotry and 
racism,” he said. City may raise property taxes to help with budget

While temperatures in Gainesville consis-
tently reach the mid-90s, one UF student is 
spending the summer in a much cooler cli-mate.
Matthew Smukall, who graduated in May 
from the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation, was selected to research migrating salmon populations of southern Alaska from July 12 to Sept. 10 as an intern with the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Associa-tion. 
The first UF student chosen to partici-
pate in the program, Smukall will live in and study a remote area of Alaskan terrain for seven weeks.
“I have always wanted to go to Alaska 
and to work in the wilderness there, and this was a chance to have someone pay for my trip,” the Orlando native said.
Smukall, who specialized in wildlife 
ecology, arrived in Kenai, Alaska, on July 6, where he began a five-day wildlife training period that will certify him in First Aid, CPR and bear, firearm and water safety. 
“They have to be prepared,” 
said senior biologist for the as-
sociation Paul Blanche, who 
will be supervising the students. “The nearest help is eight hours 
away.” 
After the completion of his wildlife train-
ing, Smukall will be paired with a student and assigned to one of eight waterside loca-tions.
He said he most looks forward to working alongside wild grizzly bears that will compete for salmon and are attracted to campsites.  
Smukall, who spent most of June research-
ing lobster in the Florida Keys, and is a mem-ber of the Gator Scuba Club, said adjusting 
to living in a remote Alaskan location with 
nighttime temperatures averaging in the low 40s will be tough. 
Smukall and his student partner will 
build and live in a 10-by-12 semipermanent, weather-proof structure.
“It is freezing here, and it was weird to see 
all of the mountains as we flew in covered in snow in the middle of July,” he said.UF student researches migrating salmon in AlaskaBy SHAY BRODERICK

Enrolled in UF’s College of Phar-
macy? There’s an app for that.
This year, incoming students 
in the College will notice that their school-supply shopping list is a bit 
more expensive than previously.
Beginning fall 2009, all incoming 
PharmD students will be required to 
have an iPod touch or an iPhone. 
UF is the second school to imple-
ment the requirement, following the University of Missouri’s May decision, according to AppleInsider.com.
“These are the instruments at the 
forefront that are developing appli-cations for medical uses by the hun-dreds,” said College of Pharmacy Dean William Riffee, an iPhone user. “We want our students to become adept at using these mobile devices early on because we see this as the future in pharmacy practice.”
Pharmacists in the future will 
rely on these devices to access pa-tient medical records and verify pre-scriptions, he said.  
Caitlin Dickens, a second-year 
pharmacy student, also sees the ad-vantages of having an iPod touch in 
the classroom.
“It holds enough information to 
fill a dictionary, but it fits in your 
pocket,” she said. “I can see how it would be useful to have a hand-held computer with you at all times.”
Still, Dickens said she is grateful 
that she is already enrolled in the program and will not be mandated to buy one of 
the devices.
“To me, it’s just an added expense 
that I would have to pay along with 
graduate tuition rate,” she said. 
The iPod touch starts at $229, 
and the iPhone starts at $99 with a new AT&T contract.
Thomas Munyer, a professor in 
the department of pharmacothera-py, said he believes the new technol-ogy will help in the classroom.
Students will use iPod touches 
or iPhones to participate in in-
teractive quizzes during class 
and download free applica-
tions that will help first-
year pharmacy students 
learn the names of various 
drugs, Munyer said.
He also said the col-
lege is developing a 
simulated patient that 
students will be intro-
duced to at the begin-
ning of class. Students 
will receive updates 
and messages about 
the status of the pa-
tient and its thera-
py throughout the 
semester.
“The primary 
learning objec-tive here is to 
help our students 
learn the process 
of caring for and moni-
toring patients over different 
periods of time,” Munyer said.Lauren Wadsworth, a UF senior 
who will enter pharmacy school in the fall, said she thinks the new re-quirement is a good idea, though she’s unsure how the device will benefit her classroom experience. The only instruction she has received so far is to download Epocrates, an application that helps determine correct medicine dosages, she said.
“Technology is always chang-
ing,” she said. “If it’s something I’ll be using in the future in my profes-sional career, why not learn to use it now?”
Wadsworth said she was fortu-
nate to have received an iPod touch for Christmas last year, before she knew it would be required as part of 
her curriculum.
“I would probably be more irri-
tated with the new rule if I had to go 
out and buy one,” she said. “Luck-ily, I was prepared for the change.”
But even with all of the new hi-
tech devices and medical advances now available, Wadsworth said she still sees a way that technology can 
improve.
“The iPhones still can’t take my 
tests for me,” she said with a laugh. 
“For now, I guess I’ll have to keep studying the old-fashioned way.” Pharmacy students will be required to buy iPhoneUf ACADEmICS

Mac Arthur plagiarized passages from four articles in The New York TimesAlso, students who drop a class paid for by Bright Futures 
will now have to repay the state if the class was dropped af-
ter drop/add period.
In the past, UF students have had the ability to drop 
classes with no penalty other than receiving a W on their transcripts. 
Wilder said students who drop a course will be charged 
about $126 per credit hour for Academic Scholar winners and $95 per credit hour for Medallion Scholar winners, the same amount Bright Futures awards students per credit hour.
About 7,000 students dropped a class during the 2008-
2009 school year, but Wilder said he believes that number could possibly decrease.
If students can’t afford to drop a class, they may be more 
inclined to accept a failing grade, potentially causing their GPAs to fall, he said.
According to its Web site, Bright Futures will also dis-
continue funding for deferment of textbooks and other uni-versity charges that Academic Scholars have received in the past.
Wilder said the changes to Bright Futures that start this 
fall will affect both incoming freshmen and students who started UF after fall 2006.
The students who receive financial aid could potentially 
be hit the hardest, Wilder said. 
Depending on a student’s income and the income of his 
or her parents, the student might not receive enough aid to cover the new costs.
“If students think they are going to need aid, they should 
apply early to get the best financial aid package,” Wilder said. 
The state will be mailing information regarding the 
changes to the Florida’s Bright Futures Scholarship Program to parents of UF students this fall.Beginning this fall, students will be charged for dropping classes
bright futures , from page 1
UFAcademic sMeredith Cochie, adjunct lecturer at the 
journalism college, discussed the issue in 
her class and posted it on the class blog so 
students could discuss it.
Wright said that all colleges fight student 
plagiarism on school work, but this is the 
first time since Wright became dean a year 
and a half ago that a UF student has been exposed for something of this magnitude.
McKeen, who will meet with Mac Arthur 
to discuss possible consequences, said he 
takes plagiarism as a  “personal insult” and that plagiarism by a student causes concern over the value of a degree from the College.
After discovering the plagiarized pas-
sages, The Colorado Springs Gazette issued a public apology on the paper’s Web site, with links to the plagiarized Times passages. Links to MacArthur’s offending stories were deactivated.
Editor Jeff Thomas said the newsroom 
got a tip Tuesday morn-ing that a passage in Mac Arthur’s story had been 
published in the Times 
only a week before.
“It does not take a lot of sleuthing on the 
part of anybody to follow up on a tip and find out whether something has been bor-
rowed from the New York Times,” he said.
Mac Arthur was unpaid, but she interned 
for college credit, he said. 
“I wouldn’t presume to tell the school 
how to resolve this one way or another,” he 
said. “I certainly have to believe that the uni-
versity doesn’t tolerate plagiarism. Whether that same standard applies to an internship setting, I don’t know.”plagiarized , from page 1“If students think they are going to need aid,

Joshua Lyon became addicted 
to prescription drugs when he 
was introduced to Vicodin as 
part of an assignment for Jane magazine. 
The now defunct women’s 
magazine published an investiga-
tive piece on the availability of 
prescriptions drugs online. 
As part of the assignment, 
Lyon ordered a bottle of 90 Vico-
din through the Internet. He first 
tried the pills just to experiment, 
but it wasn’t long before he lost 
control of his recreational drug 
use. Vicodin, Valium and Xanax 
became his three best friends. 
“Pill Head: The Secret Life of 
a Painkiller Addict,” written by 
Lyon, premiered on bookshelves 
Tuesday. The memoir tells Lyon’s 
story of  struggling with some of 
the most dangerous drugs on the streets. 
What started as a journalistic 
assignment turned into horror novel as he learned just how 
easily he became addicted to the 
pills. His gripping novel captivates 
the reader through every word  as 
the author illustrates the horrific 
experience he went through while experimenting with painkillers. 
As someone who has used 
drugs, what are your sug-
gestions to raise awareness about drug use?
Fostering a community that 
is open to talking about this 
problem is very important. What 
finally worked for me was talk-
ing to my friends and not hiding 
my addiction. Having my friends 
monitor my situation was the 
best way to come about with my problem.
At what point did you 
know you needed to seek 
help?  
I think I knew in the back of 
my head that saying “This would 
be my last pill,” was really lying 
to myself. What really set in was 
when my best friend sent me a 
message about how she felt about my addiction. The concern in her 
language and how she was caring 
and not accusing really helped 
me. If you approach a person who 
has an addiction with hostiliy 
they won’t listen nearly as much 
as they would if you came off as 
genuinely concerned.
The FDA wants to relabel 
Tylenol and put a ban on 
Vicodin and Percocet to de-crease abuse of these medica-
tions. What is your view on 
this? 
I think the ban is a huge mis-
take. They need to study people 
who are undergoing drug addic-tions and stop putting restrictions 
on the drugs. 
Either way people can get 
these drugs.  I think this is in re-action to Michael Jackson’s death, and the FDA needs to remember 
that there are still people who 
need the medications for health 
purposes. 
If you are prescribed pain-
killers, how you can avoid 
become addicted and using using the pills recreationally?
 
Be in constant communication 
with your doctor. Read the labels 
and pay attention to the warning 
signs. Doctors will realize how 
often you are asking for refills 
and will pay close attention as to 
whether or not they think you are 
becoming addicted. If you need to 
go on painkillers, start with a low 
dosage.
What has been your big-
gest struggle?  
Staying off of them. It is a huge 
obstacle to tell myself “life is bet-ter without them,” when really I could take one pill and float back to a place free of feeling. 
What are some signs that 
someone is struggling with 
an addiction?
Constricted pupils, memory 
loss and itching are the biggest 
signs. Also, people who are ad-
dicted to medications usually don’t want to be social and prefer 
to be isolated.
People think that overus-
ing painkillers is not as dan-
gerous as drugs like heroine, so it may be easier to get addicted. What can you do to help a friend who is addicted to painkillers?
Interventions can be success-
ful, but personally I’ve witnessed 
more failed interventions. The 
biggest failure with interventions is that people holding the inter-
vention think they should give 
up. But future interventions can 
be successful as long as people 
remain persistent and willing to help the person who is addicted.literature 
Book traces journalist’s struggle with prescription drugs
The threesome is not solely for sleazy 
porn films or late night programming on 
FX. 
It is an eye-opening act of playful inti-
macy and raucous abandon that college students should have no shame in aspiring to. Provided, of course, you work well in groups.  
However, there are some things you 
need to know if you want to leap into the nearest queen-sized bed set for three.
Like any other sex act, an essential as-
pect of the threesome is whom you do it 
with.  Plenty of couples look to “spice up” 
a mundane sex life by inviting company.  This is not a good idea.  
If your relationship is already in dire 
need of a fix-up, adding another person is not going to provide any reasonable solu-tion — unless said person is a relationship counselor. 
If your relationship is intact, a three-
some is still risky business. Guys, despite 
your fantasies, 
your girlfriend is 
unlikely to invite another girl into the bedroom. If she agrees, be careful. 
A bout of jealousy 
may rear its ugly head while you’re 
rearing that other 
girl.  
Or worse, you could end up being that 
guy whose girlfriend left him because the 
other girl offered better sex.  The threesome 
is best left to singles.
OK, so you’re single, now whom can 
you do it with?  Don’t do it with your 
friends, unless there’s an excessive amount of booze involved and the three of you co-
incidentally stumble from the bars and into 
bed. In this case, prepare for an awkward morning.  
The hook-up buddy may be your best bet.  You’re unattached to this person, un-less it’s 2:30 a.m. and you have a case of 
insomnia. 
Another solid bet is coordinating efforts 
with people you don’t know. Hit the bars, 
meet those special someones, and in the words of “Cruel Intentions’” Sarah Michelle 
Gellar, “introduce them to your world of 
sex, drugs and…what else do you do?”
Be cautious where you decide to do your 
taboo deeds.  You don’t have to be decadent 
and prop your undeniably classy ass up on 
a glass sink of a bathroom in a hotel’s presi-
dential suite, but the handicapped stall of a bathroom in Perkin’s will not suffice.  
One of your partners’ homes is the safest 
and least expensive setting and you won’t have to be the one washing the sheets after-ward, either.
The threesome is supposed to be fun; 
it’s not meant to be a shy affair.  Take along a bottle of champagne, or three, and lower your inhibitions ensuring an all-out experi-ence complete with giggling, licking, grab-bing, biting and scratching.
As with any group effort, remember to 
share.  Don’t get too passionate with one member of your team and ignore the oth-er then you’d just have a twosome with a voyeur standing in the corner of the room.  Creepy.  
Men, if your small soiree consists of you, 
a woman and another man, don’t be afraid to get a little physical with both.  If word 
leaks of your slightly homoerotic nighttime 
activities, no one will believe your deni-
als of getting friendly with your same-sex 
playmate anyway.
When the games are over, take the ex-
perience for what it was.  There is no need to be best, incestuous friends, but there doesn’t need to be an unspoken awkward-ness either.  
Lastly, don’t forget to be discreet — no-
body wants word of his or her indiscretions to be broadcasted across the university.  
After all, Juicy Campus no longer exists 
for a reason.When tripling up, leave love and coyness at the doorALISHA KINMAN  � AVENUE WRITER

There are some people who 
strive for greatness. Ken Edwards, 
of England, ate 36 cockroaches in one minute. Jackie Bibby, “The Texas Snake Man,” sat in a bath-tub with 87 rattlesnakes. Director Jon Russell Cring shot 12 movies in 20 months with equipment his wife won in a student filmmaking contest. 
Cring and his wife, Tracy 
Cring, a cinematographer who also works on the films with him, are taking a break from their hectic moviemaking schedule to share the fruits of their labor with the world by presenting at film festivals throughout the country. 
“This is kind of an experiment 
we’re doing here,” Cring said. “We’ve probably done about two dozen film festivals in the past year and a half or so.”
His next stop — High Springs, 
Fla.
The Extra/Ordinary Film 
Festival will be held tonight at the Priest Theater, 15 NW First St., in High Springs from 1 to 11 p.m. The festival will feature an acting symposium, a directing seminar and three of Cring’s films, “Budd,” “Bernee” and “Four on the Floor.”
“The acting and directing semi-
nar will give people a chance to audition for my upcoming mov-ies,” Cring said. “They just need to bring a head shot and resume.”    
At the acting symposium and 
directing seminar, the director will discuss the techniques he learned in the process of mak-ing 12 feature films in 20 months. Topics will include auditioning, acting for the camera, character-ization, getting the most out of your budget and the “five things every film maker needs to know.”
Cring’s films deal mainly with 
coming-of-age topics, exempli-fied by the three movies he chose to present at the High Spring festival. “Budd” is a story of a teacher 
who humiliates his high school 
English class. A psychiatrist must 
help him delve into the past so he 
can move into a better future. The 
movie features Valri Bromfield 
from “Needful Things,” a 1990s 
movie based on a Stephen King 
novel by the same name. 
“Bernee,” a comedy about a 
waitress and her adventures rais-
ing a daughter as a single mother 
in a small town, stars comedian 
Heather Horton, who was fea-
tured on “Last Comic Standing.”
“Four on the Floor” is a story 
of four high school friends trying to keep their dream of becoming 
a famous rock band alive while 
learning to make a living repair-
ing cars. The movie stars Killer 
Beaz, from “Last Comic Stand-
ing” and features music from four 
Nashville bands: De Novo Dahl, The Pink Spiders, Luna Halo and 
American Bang.
The films have been received 
well at other festivals throughout 
the country. “Bernee” won Best 
Feature at the Appalachian Film 
Festival, and Best Actress and Best 
Screenplay at the Top Ten Films 
In America festival. 
“Budd” was an official selec-
tion at the Route 66 Film Festival 
and Memphis Film Festival, and 
“Four on the Floor” was an official 
selection at the Jesse James Art 
and International Film Festival 
and Washougal International Film 
Festival.
Cring is working on his next 
moviemaking blitzkrieg, “The 
State of Film.” He’s looking for 
talent for upcoming projects in 
2010. He said he plans to go into 
different American states and 
shoot films based on local history. It will be shot, produced and pre-
miered in a two-month period. 
He will do this six times.
Not knowing where he’s going 
to shoot, who is going to be in the movies and how he’s going to pay 
for it are all part of his process. He 
is looking forward to meeting ac-
tors at the festival he can cast for 
his upcoming movies.
Cring said he refuses to sac-
rifice quality for quantity. There are too many stories he wants to 
tell, too many people he wants 
to work with, and by making 12 
films, there is a better chance of 
someone seeing something they 
like. 
“No one asked The Ramones 
why they didn’t play four-minute 
songs. You got two-minute songs 
and a cloud of dust,” he said. “My 
films are small in budget but large 
in scope.”Director shows films, scouts talent at local festival

Director Jon Russell Cring and Cinematographer Tracy Cring filming in Phoenix, AZ. The duo will present at the Extra/Ordinary Film 
Festival in High Springs tonight. 
When I was in the fifth grade, my teacher 
introduced a new weekly competition called 
“Student of the Week.” Every Friday afternoon she would saunter out from behind her desk, a freshly word-processed certificate in hand, and appoint one poor soul to a weeklong sentence of hatred from his or her peers.
“You should all learn from Jerianne,” she 
would say, patting the winner’s back as if the girl was a cancer survivor. 
“Shouldn’t we be learning from the teacher 
instead?” asked a boy who never, ever won Stu-dent of the Week. 
I’m sure to our teacher this was a fantastic 
incentive for students to behave themselves and pay attention. I used to picture her printing out that certificate every week, praising herself for her marvelous idea. 
“You truly are a genius, Mrs. Branz,” she would tell herself. “Your students will claw at each other just to kiss your shoe. Soon, you’ll be principal.” 
Then she would throw 
her head back and let out a good, hearty laugh. 
For the first few weeks 
we viciously vied for the title, each of us as clueless 
as the next on how to impress her. Some students complimented her seasonal vests, while oth-ers shouted the Pledge of Allegiance at the top of their lungs. You’d think the class had been threatened with deportation.
Our teacher was equally clueless on how to 
respond to the bizarre behavior.  
“Michael, stop smiling at me,” she would 
snap during religion class. “And no, I am not the patron saint of charity.” 
That certificate was as much a scarlet letter as it was a trophy. I held my breath every time Jerianne opened her locker the following week, praying that dozens of little plastic baggies of co-caine might spill out. 
“She was such a nice girl,” I would’ve sighed, 
as the cops hauled her away in handcuffs. “Sure-ly no Student of the Week, though.” 
Over time, our teacher lowered her standards, 
finding the thinnest rays of hope in the darkest of horses. By the time Mark won for essentially not running away from school that week, we saw through the charade and gave up trying.
Ten years later, when I catch myself beaming 
at my boss, I ponder our culture’s competitive nature.
Then, I remember how proud I felt holding 
that certificate. How warm it felt in my hands. How pretty the font rendered the capital “E” in my name.
“…WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR 
ALL!!!”

City brings clothes to life
Rebekah Geier / Alligator
Above: New York college students Zakiva 
Lewis-Gruss, Ruth Karasik and Dorothy Zittel show off New York’s eclectic style outside The Metropolitan Museum of Art on Sunday. 
Left: Moriah Geier, a dancer, mixes the 
bohemian and indie rock cultures to cre-
ate her city-inspired look. New York City styles the world. 
As home to the most notable fashion 
design academies, an extraordinary talent base, and Seventh “Fashion” Avenue, its style is unparalleled. 
The city offers a wide range of re-
tail options, from upscale boutiques to vintage flea markets, that make clothing and accessories from your wildest dreams accessible, and often unexpectedly affordable. 
The streets overflow with cre-
ative energy from store fronts, posters, graffiti, street vendors and 
people. New York is a city that takes 
risks and puts on a show. 
It is where pedestrians are not 
just j-walkers, they are inspirations.
Here, trends are fabricated, ta-
pered with and then sent strutting around the world for others to get wrapped up in. 
In New York, the style-savvy are 
giving trends a slight kick in the face. In the city that never sleeps, “trend-less” is the new trend. It is nearly im-possible to label one trend. 
If I tried, it would be something 
like “grunge meets flapper, meets bohemian, with some girly meets gothic, which then meets preppy with a touch of glam, all with the modern flair from 2009.” 
Overwhelming, I know, but in 
this city anything goes. If runways were an iPod and that iPod were 
on shuffle, we would end up with 
something a lot like the streets of New York City. Each person that steps into view represents a differ-ent genre of fashion. 
A model-esque woman walks 
down the street wearing a white, flowing maxi dress, a flower in her hair, and sunglasses straight out of 
Woodstock. 
A minute later, another woman 
walks past wearing a mini dress 
with an 80s inspired pattern, blazer, and high tops. 
The element of surprise is what 
keeps the streets alive with creativ-ity. Everything is vintage, and if it’s not then it’s made to look like it is. 
The ensembles are composed of 
a conglomerate of trends from all eras cultures. The street vendors prove this, with their tables, filled with trinkets and accessories that display copies of  the season’s popu-lar trends. These tables symbolize the beau-
ty of fashion; the freedom to piece together anything, with no limita-tions.
New York teaches us about indi-
vidual expression in style. Regard-less of your lcoation, exercise your freedom of dress by mixing and matching your favorite pieces, re-garless of how well they might actu-ally match.

No matter the time or setting there is likely 
to be the sound of a phone buzzing or a screen 
being rapped on nearby.  
Across genders and generations the use of 
smartphones, like BlackBerrys and iPhones, 
has become rampant.
 However, appropriate etiquette on how 
and when these handheld devices should be 
used is up for debate.
Etiquette expert  Constance Moore suggests, 
“You just don’t do it.” Moore, a certified etiquette consultant and 
founder of ItsOnlyProper.com, said many people treat their BlackBerry or iPhone like an adult pacifier,
“It’s like we can’t do anything without it,” 
she said.  
Smartphones have made e-mails instant 
messages, questions are answered at the click of a button,  making the lives of many more efficient. 
Despite the benefits of these handheld masterminds, many companies, businesses and schools are trying to determine how to regulate usage. 
“Set your phone on silent or vibrate, so you 
are not bothered by it,” Moore said. 
Kara Harlow, a UF junior, disagrees.  
Harlow considers her BlackBerry her “Berry Buddy,” and is on it all the time.  
“I love checking my e-mails and Facebook 
statuses,” she said. 
Harlow is one of thousands of UF students 
with a smartphone and like most, she never leaves home without it. 
“I use my phone in class, and I love playing 
Brickbreaker, especially when I’m bored,” Harlow said. 
Traditionalists believe that using 
BlackBerrys or iPhones in a meeting is an 
extreme faux pas, while technology advocates  
believe missing even a text message could be a threat to a possible business deal or important situation.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Former NFL star Steve McNair was shot 
dead in his sleep last week by a 20-year-old girlfriend distraught 
about mounting financial problems and her belief that he was see-ing someone else, police said Wednesday.
Sahel Kazemi “was spinning out of control” when she shot Mc-
Nair four times as he dozed on a sofa early Saturday, then turned the gun on herself, Police Chief Ronal Serpas said.
Interviews with friends revealed that she was making payments 
on two cars, her rent was doubling and she suspected the married McNair was having a second affair with another young woman.
She told a friend on Friday, “My life is a ball of s--- and I should 
end it,” Serpas said.
Police earlier had labeled McNair’s death a homicide, but wait-
ed for further tests and the revelations about Kaze-
mi’s personal problems before concluding that she 
pulled the trigger of a 9 mm semiautomatic pistol in a condominium McNair rented with a friend.
McNair, 36, a quarterback for the Tennessee Titans most of his 
career, met Kazemi six months ago at a sports cafe where she was a waitress and his family often ate. She seemed happy and eager to build a life with him, but something went wrong.
“We do know that she was clearly sending a message during 
the last five to seven days of her life that things were going bad 
quickly,” Serpas said, though there was no indication she told any-
one she planned to harm McNair.
Serpas said detectives learned that Kazemi recently found out 
about another young woman she thought McNair was romanti-cally involved with and had even followed that woman home, though she did not confront her.
Serpas said police believe McNair was asleep when he was 
killed because there were no defensive wounds. After shooting McNair in the head, Kazemi apparently shot him twice in the chest 
before shooting him again in the head.Police decide girlfriend shot McNair while sleeping

We are all witnesses — when 
it’s cool with LeBron James 
and Nike, at least.
Gary Parrish of CBSSports.com re-
ported that this season’s NBA MVP was dunked on by Xavier sophomore 
Jordan Crawford at the LeBron James Skills Academy on Monday night, and 
after LeBron talked to a Nike official, 
all video evidence of the posterization of “King James” was confiscated.
Can’t show any signs of weakness, 
right? Why would he want the public perception of him as the greatest bas-
ketball player since Michael Jordan 
called into question — if only for the time it takes the slam’s footage to play 
on YouTube — because some 6-foot-4 
kid who averaged 9.7 points per game in his only season as a college basket-
ball player did the unthinkable? 
While it’s hard to argue against LeBron being 
the most tal-
ented player in 
the NBA right now, it’s becom-
ing increasingly 
difficult to de-fend some of his 
actions. LeBron 
is reportedly a 
great teammate, and it shows with 
the Cavaliers. They seem to get along, 
and only with exceptional chemistry could a team prominently featuring 
Anderson Varejao win 66 games in 
the regular season. 
Some of his off-the-court moves, 
however, have been questionable. He left the court after falling to the Or-lando Magic in the playoffs without 
shaking hands with any opposing Don’t be surprised by King’s actsSome moments are simply better en-
joyed in person.
Sporting events are certainly no ex-
ception.
Sometimes, television just can’t do it jus-
tice. You can see every angle of a play but miss out on enjoying the feelings of those sit-ting in the stands — the passion, the inten-sity, the exhilaration, the defeat.
In good times or bad, it all feels more 
real.
While I laid on my couch on Sunday 
catching the second half of the epic men’s Wimbledon final, my thoughts drifted dur-ing the commercials. 
“Man, how cool it would be to be there.”I know tennis crowds don’t get all that 
rowdy. I know it was across the Atlantic Ocean. I know any seat I could’ve purchased would have had a less-than-stellar view.
But I didn’t care. I just wished I was 
there.
With that, I present the Top 10 Sporting 
Events I Wish I Saw Live.

will definitely disagree with some of my se-lections. Second, I had to be alive — so July 1988-Present. Third, I know you missed my lists, so enjoy.)

MINNEAPOLIS — First pitch was still half 
an hour away, and the empty plastic cups, 
crinkled foil wrappers and peanut shells were already piling up under the blue seats in the Metrodome’s upper deck.
While the Minnesota Twins prepared to 
play the Cleveland Indians recently, a few hundred fans were getting ready for a night-long contest of their own — a race to empty out the concession stands before they closed.
“I’ve done four hot dogs, three nachos, a 
pretzel, some popcorn and about four of these pops,” said Charlie Romain, treating himself to an early 22nd birthday feast. “It’s only been 
an hour, but I’m digesting a bit right now.”
High above third base, Sections 232 and 
233 have been turned into all-you-can-eat 
seats for 10 Tuesdays this season. So far, about one-third of the 600 available tickets have been sold for each of the special nights.
In this season of recession, the Twins are 
just one of several ballclubs trying such stuff-your-face promotions, the idea being to boost 
attendance, which is running more than 6 per-
cent behind last year.
The clubs may not have counted on glut-
tonous fans like Jorge Retamal and Ron Ben-son, though. Their goal: make the home team lose money on the deal.
“I just like the idea that, because food is 
so expensive, I can come and, like, stick it to the system,” Retamal said. “You know what 
I mean? I feel like I can even things out a little 
bit, just like baseball evens everything out.”For $34, up from the usual $22, customers 
can get a decent view of the diamond and an 
unlimited amount of hot dogs, nachos, pop-
corn, peanuts, pretzels, soda and water during a three-and-a-half-hour window that is sure to ruin any lingering New Year’s resolutions.
Kyle Cash and Adam Petersen weren’t 
worried about the cost to their stomachs.
“We’re just here to pig out,” Cash said.Retamal and Benson, students at North Central University, walked from the campus a couple of blocks away. What amounts to free 
grub is clearly a big draw for the college-stu-
dent demographic. Almost all the customers in the designated seats were young men.
“As long as there’s food involved, that’s all 
that matters,” said Benson, whose goal was to devour 20 hot dogs.
The Twins say they aren’t too concerned 
about losing money on the really big eaters. Beer isn’t included in the deal, for one thing. 
No waffle cone sundaes, either. And the all-
you-can-grab grub ends at 9 p.m. no matter how many innings are left.
“Between the ticket and the food price, 
we’re pretty well covered,” team spokesman Chris Iles said. “It is a great deal for fans, though.”
Two years ago, Dodger Stadium began of-
fering all-you-can-eat seats in an often-empty 
section of the outfield, inviting fans to eat as 
many Dodger dogs as they want. This season, the tickets cost $25 when purchased in advance, $30 on game day. In San Diego, the Padres are doing it, too, for $28 or $32, depending on the seat. The Pittsburgh Pirates, Baltimore Orioles and Texas Rangers are among the teams offer-ing stuff-your-face tickets.
The promotions are part of a larger ef-
fort by the major leagues to sell tickets in this downturn. 
This year, the Twins have tied the price of 
a $21 left-field seat for Monday games to the Dow Jones average from the previous Friday. The Dow closed last week at 8,280, dropping the price to $8.MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALLAll-you-can-eat seats gaining popularity in MLB28, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 9, 2009

players and defended his actions 
the next day, remaining com-
pletely unapologetic for bypass-
ing one of the most basic acts of good sportsmanship.
And, of course, he has made 
a few statements with his fash-ion. Three days after the NBA Finals ended, he was seen wear-
ing an “LBJ MVP” shirt, and sev-eral days later rocked a shirt that read: “Check My $tats.”
Don’t get me wrong: I think 
the $tats shirt is hilarious, and I love when athletes show person-
ality. It’s part of why nobody re-ally knows what to make of Kobe 
Bryant or even Tiger Woods. 
Kobe did everything he could to create a likable personality and 
force it on everyone (see “Kobe 
Doin’ Work”). Tiger, on the other hand, let his dominance of the golf world do the talking.
LeBron has stated his desire 
to become the first billionaire athlete, and his marketing firm 
declared its plan to make him a 
“global icon.” Usually athletes focus on winning first before cap-
italizing on their celebrity status.
But like child movie or music 
stars, athletes who became fa-mous at a young age have been 
held to different standards than their peers. LeBron has been the next big 
thing since he was a junior in high school. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that he responds to 
certain situations differently than 
the rest of us, and the same goes for the majority of young ath-
letes, especially those who make 
the leap from high school to the pros. 
Plenty of stars in the mak-
ing are constantly surrounded by people — many of whom are looking to cling to an eventual 
source of income — telling them 
every decision they make is the right one. If it’s been a long time 
since you’ve been told you were 
doing something wrong in life, it’s not hard to imagine you might 
end up with a slightly warped 
perspective of yourself. It’s hard to be wrong when you’re always 
right.
And it’s hard to get shown up 
when you’re the King.

� EMPLOYERS DISAGREE 
WITH THE UNION ON WAGES.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
JOHANNESBURG — South 
African construction work-
ers went on an indefinite strike 
Wednesday at stadiums being built for the 2010 World Cup — a move that could derail Africa’s historic first World Cup tourna-
ment.
Thousands of workers at stadi-
ums across the country downed tools after wage negotiations 
deadlocked earlier this week.  
Workers are demanding a 13 per-
cent pay increase while employ-ers are only offering a 10.4 per-
cent rise.
The strike could delay comple-
tion of flagship projects such as 
the Soccer City stadium in Johan-nesburg and stadiums in Cape Town and Durban. Other stadi-ums in smaller towns have also 
been affected. The venues need 
to be completed by December to meet deadlines set by FIFA, the game’s ruling body, before the tournament kicks off in June 2010.
Lesiba Seshoka of the Nation-
al Union of Mineworkers, which represents construction work-
ers, said 70,000 workers were in-
volved in the strike, which 
would con-tinue until 
employers met their demands.
He said the union was not 
worried about the completion of the stadiums — that was a con-cern of the tournament’s local or-ganizing committee.“We are worried about our 
families getting food, not a rich 
man buying a ticket to watch a 
game,” he said.
Joe Campanella of the South 
African Federation of Civil Engi-neering Contractors, which rep-
resents construction companies, 
said only 11,000 workers took part in the strike.
He has said the deal offered by 
employers amounts to a 65 per-
cent increase including benefits.
However, the unions have 
complained that some workers 
are earning about $1.50 an hour and others $5 a week. Workers in South Africa are supposed to 
earn a minimum wage of about 
$200 a month.
The strike has been criticized 
for jeopardizing South Africa’s chances of hosting a successful 
World Cup — a monthlong event 
avidly watched by hundreds of millions around the world. 
But the Congress of South Af-
rican Trade Unions, which repre-
sents the country’s largest trade 
union federations, has come out in support of the construction workers.

The legend of Preston Tucker’s 
epic slugging abilities preceded 
him to an almost unhealthy level.
It turned out to be completely 
true, and he began creating his 
own folklore from the moment he 
stepped on UF’s campus.
The freshman first baseman 
arrived in Gainesville last sum-mer and had UF sophomore Josh Adams throw him some batting practice.
The lefty’s bat hit bomb after 
bomb over the fence, including 
several that bounced off Stadium 
Road.
Hitting the scoreboard — lo-
cated in right-center field, 375 feet away from home plate — became a normal occurrence.
Then he started actually play-
ing in games for the Gators.
Tucker turned in one of the best 
seasons at the plate in school histo-ry. He broke the single-season RBI 
record previously held by Ryan 
Shealy (80 in 2002), a milestone that withstood four seasons of challenges by Matt LaPorta, one of the best sluggers to come through Gainesville.
Tucker took home UF’s “Triple 
Crown” by leading the team in batting average (.364), home runs (15) and RBI (85).  He also led the Gators in four other offensive cat-egories — slugging percentage (.628), total bases (152), multiple-hit games (27) and multiple-RBI games (23).
The freshman’s phenomenal 
season did not go unnoticed. 
He became the first UF player 
to earn the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association 
(NCBWA) Freshman Hitter of the 
Year award. He earned Co-South-eastern Conference Freshman of the Year honors with LSU pitch-er Matty Ott. He was named to Freshman All-America teams by four different publications (Base-ball America, Louisville Slugger, Rivals.com and the NCBWA). 
Tucker also earned the SEC Fresh-
man of the Week award three times, setting a new school mark.
The Tampa native was even in-
vited to the 2009 USA Baseball National Team Trials.
Coach Kev-
in O’Sullivan thought he had 
something spe-
cial when he re-cruited Tucker, 
but even O’Sullivan was amazed at how well the slugger adjusted in his first year.
“There’s just certain guys that 
when they come to the plate — ev-
erybody stops what they’re doing 
and they watch,” O’Sullivan said during the postseason. “He’s got an air about him. He’s got con-fidence, and you can see it in his mannerisms. He’s been locked in for an awfully long time.”
Tucker has given people plenty 
to watch as well. The most epic feat of his fresh-
man year came on April 8 when UF faced UCF and the slugger had a school-record 11 RBI in a 16-3 Gators victory.
In the fifth inning, he pulled a 
ball over the right-field fence for a grand slam. The very next inning, Tucker took a ball the other way for a three-run home run to left-center field. To cap it off, the fresh-man hit his second grand slam of the game to center field in the sev-enth inning.
The slugger saved his best for 
his postseason debut, hitting .531 with 14 RBI, including going 13 for 20 in five NCAA games. The freshman earned Regional MVP honors after going 9 for 13 in three games, including six RBI and two home runs as UF advanced out of a regional that included Miami for the first time in 11 tries.
Not bad for someone all 30 
MLB clubs passed on for 50 
rounds of the draft coming out of 
high school.
For living up to the insur-
mountable hype and producing one of the best seasons at the plate in UF history, Preston Tucker is the alligatorSports No. 5 UF Ath-lete of 2008-09.

Linebacker Brandon Spikes made some of the most memorable 
plays of the season and anchored a vastly improved UF defense.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
sports@alligator.org
On Georgia’s second play of 
its first drive, star running back 
Knowshon Moreno took the handoff from Matthew Stafford, tried to make a cut to get back to the line of scrimmage and was driven to the ground by Brandon Spikes.
Moreno tore the Gators’ de-
fense apart in 2007 with 188 rush-ing yards and three touchdowns in a 42-30 loss, but Spikes made it clear that the 2008 UF defense was not going to make the same mistakes two years in a row.
The vicious hit put Georgia 
back 1 yard, and Spikes remained on top of Moreno to trash talk for a few extra seconds.
“I just told him he better get 
ready because I’m going to be here all night,” Spikes said after the game.
That hit set the tempo for the 
Gators’ 49-10 win against the Bulldogs in Jacksonville a year after being embarrassed by a team-wide end zone celebration following Georgia’s first touch-
down in 2007.
Spikes had several other mem-
orable plays during the Gators’ run to their second national 
championship in three years, in-cluding an interception returned for a touchdown against LSU.
The middle linebacker rum-
bled down the field for 52 yards on the first play of the fourth quarter for his first pick-six at any level. 
After reaching the end zone, 
Spikes shanked a celebratory punt into the crowd to commem-orate the occasion.
“I never took a pick to the 
house ever in my football career, and just the passion for the game 
kind of took over,” Spikes said following 
UF’s 51-21 vic-tory against then-No. 4 LSU.
As a junior, 
Spikes was the unquestioned 
leader of the No. 4 scoring de-fense in the nation — in the box scores, on the field and in the locker room.
Despite sitting out the first 
game of the season, Spikes’ 93 tackles on the year ranked first on the much-improved UF defense, and he was second on the team with four interceptions.
While the improvement of the Gators defense can largely be at-tributed to the emergence of a consistent secondary, the steady play by Spikes and the rest of the front seven anchored the de-fense.
A year after allowing 25.5 
points and 361.8 yards per game of total offense, Spikes and the defense gave up 12.9 points and 285.3 yards per game in 2008. 
And Spikes is never one to dis-
appoint the fans. He stirred up the Tennessee faithful the past two years by questioning the Vol-unteers’ effort on the field.
Although Spikes could have 
joined Percy Harvin and declared for the NFL Draft, he chose to stay at UF for his senior season. 
In 2009, Spikes will be part of a 
defensive unit that returns every-one in the two-deep depth chart.
For making some of the year’s 
most memorable plays, leading the Gators on and off the field and turning a questionable de-fense into a lockdown unit, Bran-don Spikes is the alligatorSports No. 6 UF Athlete of 2008-09.
BY THE NUMBERS: Spikes earned 
two second-place votes, one fourth-place vote, one eighth-place vote and was left off two ballots.Before shooting herself, she sat next to his body and “tried 
to stage it so she would fall in his lap,” Serpas said. She did, but 
her body slid to the floor and ended up at McNair’s feet. The gun was found underneath her.
Kazemi’s family told reporters that the woman was so con-
fident McNair was divorcing his wife of 12 years that she was preparing to sell her furniture and move in with him.
But associate Mike Mu, who has worked with McNair’s 
charitable association for years, said earlier Wednesday that McNair’s wife, Mechelle McNair, “didn’t know who this girl is.” No records of divorce proceedings have surfaced. The Mc-Nairs have four children.
Two days before the shooting, police stopped Kazemi driv-
ing a Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicle that McNair had 
given her for her birthday in May.
According to an arrest affidavit, Kazemi had bloodshot eyes 
and alcohol on her breath. She refused a breath test and told an 
officer “she was not drunk, she was high.” She was charged with driving under the influence. McNair was with her but not charged. He later made her bail.
Serpas said even though her name and McNair’s were on 
the Cadillac’s title, she was apparently responsible for making payments. She was also making payments on another car after 
she couldn’t sell it.
Kazemi had no history of violence, but “on the last several 
days of her life it’s obvious that she made some very poor deci-
sions,” Serpas said.
Mechelle McNair has not spoken publicly since the shoot-
ing. Bishop Joseph W. Walker III of Mount Zion Baptist Church, which the McNairs have attended since moving to Nashville in 1997, said that she is doing as well as can be expected.THURSDAY, JULY 9, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 31

Obviously the most recent event on the list, this im-

ite tennis match ever. Roddick reminded everyone why he has been so highly touted his entire pro career, while Federer fought yet another tough challenge on Wimble-don’s grass to capture his record-breaking 15th Grand Slam title. How can a 16-14 final set not be captivating? It made me remember  why I love Wimbledon’s lack of a fifth-set tiebreaker so much. We could’ve been cheated (I’m looking at you, U.S. Open). You really had to won-der who would blink first, yet either winner presented an amazing story. The timing — Sunday morning and early afternoon, the perfect accompaniment to brunch — is so unique and special. This one definitely had people saying “Did you see that?” and people who had missed it clamoring for the replay. Here’s to hoping the 2010 fi-nal can come even close to the last two years.

I’m not sure much introduction has to be given for 
this game, at least around Gainesville. “The Block” will 
likely suffice. While still in my pre-Alligator days, I un-fortunately chose to spend the weekend at home. I’ve 
imagined and heard after the fact just how crazy the at-
mosphere was inside The Swamp. I was left watching 
one of the biggest plays of the year on my living room TV. Sure doesn’t capture the worry, pause of wonder and complete euphoria felt by those at the game. I guess 
seeing The Promise firsthand was my consolation prize.
6) nhl — 2004 sTanley cup Finals game 7: Tampa 
bay lighTning deFea T calgaR y Flames 2-1
This game marked the end of my brief love affair 
with the NHL. I will absolutely admit my 16-year-old 
self jumped on the Lightning bandwagon along with the rest of the Tampa Bay area. We got a heck of a series too, going the full length, and Games 5 and 6 went into 
overtime. Heck, I was listening to hockey playoff games 
on the radio if I couldn’t be around the television for a 
period. I readily admit this was an absurd moment of my life, unlikely to be repeated even if the Lightning be-come relevant again. And in the days of pre-HD televi-
sion coverage — and perhaps still now — hockey games 
are a lot more fun in person (this coming from a man 
who has been to only a handful).
