Sister Hazel acoustic set raises money for rehab center

No campus visits required.IBy MARIA PIQUET
Alligator Contributing Writer
The sound resonating through the
halls of Trinity United Methodist Church
Thursday night wasn't of prayer, praise or
preaching. It was rock music.
The church auditorium filled with 300
people who came to see local Sister Hazel
musicians Ken Block and Drew Copeland
perform a concert to benefit Shands Vista
Florida Recovery Center, a rehabilitation
facility.
Block and Copeland performed an
acoustic show strumming their guitars
and singing favorites such as "Change
Your Mind," "Champagne High," "All
For You" and "A Little Like Heaven."
The pair sat on wooden stools and took
time to tell stories between songs. "Cham-
pagne High," a song about Block's high
school girlfriend, was originally called
"You Broke My Heart, You Hooker."
"Andrew and I, we don't do a ton of
acoustics anymore these days, so it's kind
of fun for us to get out here without the
band and all the equipment, just kind of
jump up there, be idiots and tell stories
and all that," Block said.
Attendees Liam and Michelle Schauer
and their two children, Ellie and Marshall,
all wore Sister Hazel T-shirts to show sup-
port for the band.
"I've loved their music since I first
heard them in '94," Michelle Schauer
said.
The love for the band runs in the fam-
ily. Michelle Schauer snapped photos

Ellie posed with Copeland.
"I absolutely loved this concert," Mi-
chelle Schauer said. She said she thought
the venue allowed for a more intimate
performance than the band's recent show
in the O'Connell Center.
Tickets for the event were $20 and VIP
tickets, which included dinner after the
show and a meet-and-greet with Block,
were $100. All proceeds went to provide
treatment scholarships to patients at the
Florida Recovery Center and outreach op-
portunities to help people recover from
addiction.
This event was particularly special to
Block, a recovering drug addict and alco-
holic and former patient of the center.
"I have seen firsthand what this group
of people does to change people's lives
in dramatic ways," Block said. "And I've
seen what this fellowship and community
of people have done to nurture people's
souls on a day-to-day basis."
Block said he thanks Gainesville and
the recovery center helped him stay clean
for seven years and counting.
"It shaped who I am as a writer, as
an artist, as a performer, as a neighbor,
as a parent, all those things. And I've
had many opportunities to go anywhere
but the support system that I have in
Gainesville is invaluable."
This was the second benefit concert
Black and Copeland have done for the
recovery center, and they plan on doing
many more.
"I'm just happy to be here, thrilled to
be here," Block said.
I always wanted to pursue an advanced
engineering degree, but with my career
as a tactical airlift pilot for the Air Force,
I didn't think I'd be able to. When I
found out about the UF EDGE program,
it was exactly what I has been looking
for. As a C- 17 pilot, my duties take me
as far as Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq and
countless others, often with little to no
advanced notice. Having an all-online
degree program allows me to take my
education with me on the road. The
EDGE staff has gone out of their way to
ease my transition back into the
academic world, and they stand ready
at every turn to help me in whatever
way they can.

Local artists raise money for
children's education in Uganda
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The sounds of bluegrass and
acoustic guitars filled the air
Wednesday night as students
stood around the dimly lit Com-
mon Grounds to raise money and
awareness for Invisible Children.
The concert was put on by UF's
Invisible Children chapter, which
is part of a national organization
whose goal is to raise awareness
about the long-running civil war
in northern Uganda and to raise
money for the education of numer-
ous child soldiers in the country.
"Education is the best way
to break the vicious cycle," said
Stephanie Alman, UF sophomore
and president of the chapter. "Ev-
ery cent from the concert goes to a
secondary school in Gulu, Ugan-
da."
The benefit concert made about
$1,300 from ticket sales and mer-
chandise, such as T-shirts, peace
bracelets and assorted snacks. This
is the second benefit concert spon-
sored by Invisible Children. The
first one was held last April.
"Last year, we had over 150
attendees and made over $2,000
from tickets and a raffle," said Bri-
ana Banos, director of events for
Invisible Children and organizer
of this year's concert.
Banos expected the concert to
raise less money because the orga-
nization was unable to hold a raffle
this year.
The concert was comprised
of four acts: Sirena Claire, a rock
band, Jesse Lash and John Lash,
who both played acoustic guitars,
and Sandy Strings Grass Band, a
bluegrass group. Although their
styles of music differed, the per-formers united for the cause.
"Jesse Lash performed at last
year's concert, and his brother
agreed to this show as well," Ba-
nos said.
Concert goers came and wentthroughout the night to support a
band and to learn about the cause.
"I spent two months in Uganda
helping with AIDS welfare, so I
fully support the cause," sopho-
more Mackenzie Pape said.

By KRISTEN BOWE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Donna Lee Romans makes cards for Halloween, hoping
to make her quota so she can have enough money to pay
rent and day care fees.
Romans, 41, and five other women are residents of the
Arbor House, a home for pregnant women and single moth-
ers. This month, the women are busy making goods for the
holidays to earn money and better the lives of their chil-
dren.
Michelle Burton, administrator for the Arbor House, said
in 2007 the organization decided to employ the six residents
at the facility instead of sending them to work in low-pay-
ing local jobs.
She said through working for Cottage Industries, the
women are able to learn work ethic by making bags for $12,
purses for $15, Gators postcards for $3 and
Local keychains for $3.
News The women keep all the proceeds from
the things they make, averaging $240 a week
per woman and use the money to pay Arbor
House rent and day care.
The products, available at Ward's Supermarket, Loop de
Loop, Orange and Blue Textbooks, Earth Pets Natural Pet
Market, Wild Iris Books and Ceciles, sold well in the past
but declined during the past year because of the economy,
Burton said.
"Most women are motivated to commit to the program
because they want to give more to their children than
they've been giving them," Burton said.
Romans arrived at the Arbor House two years ago with
her two-week-old daughter, Brandie Rose.
Romans said she was staying at the St. Francis House but
was desperate to find a home in a safe environment for her
daughter.
Since arriving at the Arbor House in August of 2007, Ro-
mans said the Cottage Industries program and living at the
Arbor House have changed her life for the better.
"It was the first place I could voice an idea and have it
considered," she said.
Romans said it is an accomplishment when people buy
her goods.
"Somebody thought something I did was worth buying,"
she said. "It's the most rewarding job I've ever had."

Once upon a time, we had time to sleep. But unfortu-nately, school has taken precedence over the rest we
would prefer to have. We haven't seen our pillows
since Wednesday, and our mothers think we're dead. Still,
we trudge through this cesspool of a semester to deliver you
a we-didn't-think-it-was-possible-to-function-on-five-hours-
of-sleep-every-two-days-until-we-tried edition of.
Darts & Laurels
And guess what? It's not.
In case you haven't heard, UF's nine-time All-America
gymnast Melanie Sinclair was arrested Wednesday after
police said she stashed guns stolen by her boyfriend dur-
ing a burglary spree. For not realizing that her boyfriend
was up to no good when he brought over a cut-open safe
and a bunch of guns, we launch a did-you-seriously-not-
think-something-was-up? DART at Melanie Sinclair.
You set the standards on the bars. It's time to raise your
own.
While on the subject of arrests, a local man was arrested
at a local swimming pool Wednesday for slapping a wom-
an's butt after she turned him down. He was also issued
warnings for trespassing at the Constans Theatre and So-
rority Row on Oct. 9. For being a total creeper and violat-
ing a woman's personal space, we throw a wonder-if-you-
know-the-mobile-masturbator DART at Jason Zeid.
We predict there will be some Razorback-side kicking
in the Swamp on Saturday. Here's a preemptive hope-
you-start-to-throw-the-ball LAUREL at the Gators for the
team's victory.
For actions that led to a deluge of biblical proportions
in Riker Hall on Saturday, we shoot a didn't-your-mother-
teach-you-to-play-with-your-balls-outside? DART at the
football-fail kids who are too childish to own up to their
actions.
This year's Gator Growl promises to be more entertain-
ing than the past few. For selecting performers who might
actually draw a crowd, we give a we-actually-thought-
about-going-this-year LAUREL to Gator Growl. But to
go so far as to call O.A.R. a "legendary rock band"? Sure,
they've been around since 1996, but languishing in obscu-
rity for the better part of a decade doesn't make you mat-
ter.
A 6-year-old Colorado boy duped his parents, national
broadcasters and the National Guard by tricking them into
thinking he was flying in his parents' homemade helium
balloon (which looked more like a failed flying saucer).
For hiding in a cardboard box in the attic while the nation
watched him "die," we award a that-was-the-most-epic-
game-of-hide-and-seek-EVER LAUREL to Falcon Heene.
And to his parents, we toss a what-else-would-you-ex-
pect-from-a-boy-named-Falcon LAUREL for, well, nam-
ing him Falcon.
Despite having darted you last week for your steamy
ways, we've had a change of heart. For finally cooling your
heels and letting us not die at the football game on Satur-
day, we give a can't-wait-to-complain-about-how-cold-
it-is-when-we're-downtown-Saturday-night LAUREL to
Mother Nature.
Thanks for reading this week. Please send all com-
plaints to thanksfortheconstructivecriticism@alligator.org.
We love it when you call us communist, socialist, fascist,
left-wing, right-brained, indoctrinating wannabe journal-

NAZ&_NA I 1.111
Gz 'Giv i ng pea ce p rize fo r 'inte ntions' wrong
'm going to go ahead and go on the record right now.
I want everyone to know that I absolutely and wholly
intend on permanently ridding the world of poverty,
genocide, war and any other possible negative affliction.
The details are unimportant -just mark that this is my
will and it shall be done.
The goal, of course, is to win a Nobel Peace Prize.
With the recent announcement that President Barack
Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "his vi-
sion of and work for a world without nuclear weapons,"
it is only logical for me to jump-start my future career
with a nice little resume boost that a Nobel Peace Prize
would provide.
When it comes down to it, awarding President Obama
the peace prize is at best preemptive but at worst dirty
politics. I am certainly no conservative as both my writ-
ing and friends will reveal, but it is absurd to award
what was once one of the world's foremost awards for
intentions.
Sure, Obama and Russian President Dmitry Med-
vedev agreed this summer to reduce nuclear weapons
"someday" by 1,000 to 2,000 warheads. But this is not a
concrete treaty with an actual time frame, and it would
leave in place enough nuclear warheads to drop seven
on each major city in the world. Sounds to me like there
are still plenty of nukes to go around, and then some.
And why not award the peace prize to Medvedev since
he also worked to negotiate the treaty?
The answer lies within the makeup of the Norwe-
gian Nobel Committee. Contrary to what most people
believe, the Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by former
winners, unbiased social activists or even the world.
True, the nominations can come from any of the abovegroups of people, but the actual
decision on who wins the award is
made by the five-man Norwegian
Nobel Committee. The committee
is appointed by Stortinget, which
is the Norwegian Parliament, and
Kyle Robisch as such roughly shares its politicalletters@alligator org composition. What this boils down
to is that three of the votes on the
committee are from current or former members of the
Norwegian Labour Party and Socialist Left Party. The
other two members hail from Norway's right-wing po-
litical parties.
What does this all mean?
It would seem that the Norwegian Nobel Commit-
tee was unable to mask its political motivations when
awarding the peace prize this year. It isn't awarded
in an unbiased, fair manner as several members of the
Norwegian Labour Party (again the majority on the
committee) has made public its infatuation with our
president.
Maybe seven years from now, President Obama will
have accomplished his platform points, including rid-
ding the world of nuclear weapons. But until that day,
President Obama should have done the wise and ma-
ture thing and declined the award. Not only does it di-
lute the weight of the Nobel Peace Prize, it weakens the
legitimacy of his platform and intentions. If America
and the world are already happy with Obama as is, then
why try any harder? Then again, I really could use that
resume booster.
Kyle Robisch is a political science and economics junior.
His column appears on Fridays.

Letters to the Editor
Gators shouldn't cheat deserving fans
First off, I would like to congratulate all of
you who got a ticket to the Florida-Arkansas
game. I have only been able to get one ticket
this year. I tried to obtain a ticket for the game,
and once again, failed to do so. Around 6:05
p.m., I saw people on Facebook auctioning off
tickets.
To all of you who did this, you are a dis-
grace to the Gator Nation and need to learn
respect for your peers.
You seem to think it's perfectly alright to
take advantage of those who did not get tick-
ets. I congratulate your friends and family for
not teaching you respect. I refuse to pay for
someone's room and board (and for those of
you over 21, your Saturday-night drinking
binge) to watch the Gators.
This system is obviously greatly flawed
and should be adjusted. I'm tired of seeing
people with season tickets auctioning them off
on Facebook for $50.
If you don't care about football, leave the
tickets for someone who does. I know this is
asking a lot because you are selfish, rude, ir-
responsible and inconsiderate.
I meanhey, those values don't really matter
to society anyway. So I implore you, go ahead,
continue to get your tickets and take advan-
tage of your peers. One thing is for sure, if you
try to take advantage of me, don't ask for any-
thing from me because I will turn around and
simply say "f**k you."

Reader's indoctrination claims invalid
I should not be surprised that, when the Al-
ligator reported on the active role the Interna-
tional Socialist Organizationtookin organizing
for the National Equality March inWashington
D.C., Rafael Yaniz accused the paper of trying
to "indoctrinate" its readership. He stands
firmly in the tradition of American reaction-
aries comfortable with any attack, no matterhow spurious, to direct attention away from
the real struggles of the left to better the lives
of working people and oppressed groups. It is
telling that he has no "counter position" to our
fight for LGBT civil rights; he merely objects to
our existence and is happy to throw the baby
out with the bathwater.
Who seeks to "indoctrinate" whom, Mr.
Yaniz? Is it the ISO, eager to take to the streets
to fight oppression wherever we see it? Or is
it you, with your bizarre case that socialists
should be barred from newspaper coverage?
Socialists and the working class have struggled
for more than a century against your brand of
ideological censorship.
We didn't take it from Bismarck, President
Wilson or Sen. McCarthy, and we surely won't
take it from you.
Perhaps if you spent a bit more time ex-
amining your politics and world, Mr. Yaniz,
and less time indulging in infantile reactions
to newspaper articles about people actively
working to better the lot of the downtrodden,
I would see you at our Thursday night meet-
ings. Until then, I can only hope the Alligator
ignores your totalitarian opinion.

Patriotism not required for education
The lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf
of the student who did not stand during the
pledge is not "frivolous." What is frivolous is
being kicked out of his math class because he
did not want to pledge allegiance to the Unit-
ed States.
A school's purpose is to teach academic
subjects, not to continue traditions, foment
patriotism or instill discipline. An educator's
primary duty while acting in that capacity is
ensuring that his or her students obtain the
best education possible. Forcibly removing a
student from class for any reason other than
being a disturbance to the learning of otherstudents or a concern for the saf
being of someone is unjustifiable

Wuerffel, Jabbawockeez discuss Growl preparations
By J. HUNTER SIZEMORE
Alligator Staff Writer
hsizemore@alligator org
When Danny Wuerffel was
first asked to host Gator Growl,
he had some reservations.
The mid-'90s Gators Football
legend currently works with De-
sire Street Ministries, a Christian
charity, and remembers the R-
rated reputation Gator Growl had
during his college days.
In its history, Gator Growl has
hosted Dave Chappelle, Dane
Cook and Mitch Hedberg, all co-
medians known for foul mouths
and drug humor.
"We love to have fun and we
love to joke and sometimes, in the
spirit of joking, [Desire Street and
I] feel it can go a little too far,"
Wuerffel said.
However, Matt Sloan, this
year's producer of Gator Growl,
assured him that the event's new,
family-friendly direction would
continue this year.
"We're looking forward to a
good night, and hopefully we'll
be saying the same thing when
we're done," Wuerffel said.
In preparation for Friday
night's show, Gator Growl of-
ficials held a press conference
Thursday night for Wuerffel andhip-hop dance group Jabbawoc-
keez.
Jam band O.A.R. and former
Saturday Night Live comedian
Dana Carvey were not present.
Wuerffel said he feels when
Gators Football seniors, includ-
ing Tim Tebow, Brandon Spikes
and Brandon James, graduate this
year, it will be as if new members
are joining his fraternity -the
fraternity of Gators football leg-
ends past.
"Of course for me, I have a
real neat place in my heart for
our quarterback, Tim Tebow, and
what he's done and who he is,"
Wuerffel said. "That makes it all
the more sweeter for me to see.
all the accolades he's getting."
Sloan, who also spoke at
the conference, added bringing
Wuerffel to Gator Growl was part
of honoring the Gators legends
graduating this year.
"I mean, we're graduating
two of the best seniors in college
football," Sloan said. "Brandon
Spikes and Tim Tebow and the
rest of that class has brought us
two national championships and
a Heisman trophy."

Shortage threatens pie
Pumpkin filling scarce
By RENEE MONTALTO
Alligator Contributing Writers
Shayna Brouker has a
pumpkin problem.
After searching grocery
stores for canned pumpkin
in the last few weeks, her
hopes of making pumpkin-
filled foods faded.
Brouker, a UF journalism
senior, said she tried Publix
on 34th Street and the loca-
tion on Archer Road, but
neither store had canned
pumpkin.
"I even asked the store
employees, and they said
they didn't have any and
wouldn't for a while," she
said.
According to an article
on CNN.com, the nation's
pumpkin-growing states are
suffering poor weather.
"I had heard there was a
pumpkin shortage due to abad harvest, so I went out
to stock up but couldn't find
canned pumpkin anywhere
in stores," Brouker said.
"I had heard there
was a pumpkin short-
age due to a bad har-
vest, so I went out to
stock up but couldn't
ind canned pumpkin
anywhere in stores."
Shayna Brouker
UFjournalism senior
Publix manger Betty
Brunson said the store at 125
SW 34th St. has been out of
stock for about four weeks.
Brouker, who uses
canned pumpkin to make
pumpkin bread, oatmeal,
waffles and pancakes, said
she continued searching forthe essential ingredient but
was out of luck for about
two weeks.
"I finally found it about
two weeks ago at Walmart. I
bought five cans of it to stock
up, " she said.
Joe Hight, manager at The
Fresh Market, 4120 NW 16th
Blvd., said his store was one
of the few that didn't run out
of canned pumpkin.
"I've heard of other shop-
pers who have had trouble,
but that was not the case
here," Hight said. "My sup-
plier has been able to supply
me with all the stuff to make
pumpkin pie and pumpkin
bread."
Brouker said had she not
been able to find canned
pumpkin, she had alterna-
tive methods.
"I could have bought an
actual pumpkin and scraped
out the guts, but that is a lit-
tle labor-intensive," she said.
"I would have probably just
had to wait for next season."'Greeks' to greet Gators
By GAIA BONINI
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Greeks know how to celebrate
Homecoming.
Scott Michael Foster and Amber Ste-
vens, who play Cappie and Ashleigh on
ABC Family's "Greek," will be partici-
pating in Homecoming events and pro-
moting ABC Family's "Pledge Yourself
to Do Something" campaign, which
encourages students, Greek and non-
Greek, to volunteer for organizations
within the community.
The pair will be meeting students
and signing autographs in the UF Book-
store today from 3:30 to 5 p.m.
Foster and Stevens will stay in
Gainesville through the weekend to get
down with the Gators, who will return
to The Swamp to take on the Arkansas
Razorbacks Saturday.
"UF has a great reputation of stu-
dents willing to be involved," said Ali-
cia Nunez, an intern for ABC and seniorin telecommunications and business at
UF.
Before meeting fans at the bookstore
today, Foster and Stevens will ride in a
convertible down University Avenue as
part of the Homecoming parade.
They will also crown the Homecom-
ing king and queen at
Gator Growl tonight.
Before Saturday's
game, Alpha Epsilon
Pi will host a barbe-
cue and meet-and-
greet for Foster and
Stevens at the frater-
Foster nity's house at 1904W University Ave.
Anyone is welcome to attend the
barbecue, which starts at 1 p.m. and
continues until the pair heads to the sta-
dium for kickoff, Nunez said.
The cast of "Greek" has taken time
off from the show's production to tour
colleges around the nation and promote
the "Pledge Yourself" campaign.

Record number turns out for two-mile cancer walk
By LAURA MONTALTO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Hundreds of red, white and gold
balloons illuminated the UF's cam-
pus Thursday night.
Participants supporting The Leu-
kemia & Lymphoma Society's an-
nual Light the Night Walk showed
up at the North Lawn of Ben Hill
Griffin Stadium around 6 p.m.
This year, more than 700 people,
which was a record number, came
out to raise money and awareness
for leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's
disease and myeloma.
Red balloons were given to fund-
raisers, white balloons to cancer
survivors and patients and gold bal-
loons to people who had lost some-
one to one of these blood diseases.
The race, which started around
7:15 p.m., was a two-mile route
through UF's campus while partici-
pants carried their electrically lit bal-
loons with them.
Julie Shaffer, an international
public affairs major and one of the
event organizers, said it had been
in the works since the beginning of
summer. She got involved after her
uncle passed away from non-Hodg-
kin's lymphoma a few years ago.
"When you have a personal tie
to someone who has passed away
from one of these diseases, you want
to do something to remember them
by," she said. "It's always hard, but
the reason we are doing this is toLight the Night walkers gather Thursday outside Ben Hill Griffin Stadium for a two-mile trek, which ben-
efited cancer patients and their families. They displayed red balloons to support cancer patients and
white balloons for survivors.
raise money and awareness about
leukemia and lymphoma."
They quickly changed the fund-
raising goal from $1,000 to $5,000,
Shaffer said.
The money raised this year has
surpassed expectations and is high-
er than any other year, she said.Every year in the United States,
an estimated 894,000 people are af-
fected by leukemia, lymphoma and
myeloma, Ashley Mattson, cam-
paign manager for the North Florida
Chapter of The Leukemia & Lym-
phoma Society, said.
These diseases are all blood can-cers, and there is no cure for them.
Leukemia is a cancer of the white
blood cells and causes the most can-
cer deaths for people under the age
of 20. Lymphoma is cancer of the
lymph nodes, organs that consist of
many types of cells, Mattson said.
Every four minutes someone isdiagnosed with a blood cancer, and
every 10 minutes someone dies from
one of these cancers, she added.
"Our goal is to provide hope for
people battling blood cancers, im-
prove the quality of life for these
patients and their families, gain
awareness and raise money. With-
out money, we can't fund research.
Every penny raised is a help," she
said.
This has been a nationwide event
for the past 11 years, and Gainesville
has been a part of it since the begin-
ning because of the large group of
students at UF, Shaffer said. The
Gator Nation is active in giving
back, and coming here would prove
why being a Gator is so great.
Jeanette Whaley, a health science
major, has been a volunteer at Light
the Night Walk for two years. She
decided to get involved in this event
because friends of hers have been di-
agnosed with leukemia.
Whaley was drawn to the
cause because she thought it was
a good way to bring awareness to
Gainesville. She said it was a way to
learn more about the diseases. This
year, there were more organizations
involved this year than previous
years, like Radio Disney and Mc-
Donald's, and the walk was defi-
nitely a success, she said.

Weather cools as city heats up for Homecoming events
* LOWS WILL BE NEAR 45.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville is about to get a
breath of fresh air.
According to the NationalWeather Service in Jacksonville,
a cold front will reach Gainesville
today.
The cooler weather is expected
to last until the middle of next
week, meteorologist Matt Zibura
said, possibly dropping to 43 de-
grees.
"It's been abnormally warm,well above normal," Zibura
said. "This is a pretty good cool
down."
Local He said the high
News for October is typi-cally 81 degrees, and
the low nears 60 de-
grees, but recently temperatures
have been 10 degrees higher. Hesaid temperatures should become
more seasonal after the cold front
passes through.
UF sophomore Chris Ludwig
said the weather this past week has
been "like a fire-breathing dragon
breathing down [his] neck. You
know, usual Florida weather."
Like many students, he is readyfor a change.
"I can't wait for it to cool off,"
he said. "It'll be nice."
Shelby Greene, a UF freshman,
said she's used to the heat after
living in Jacksonville.
"It's still annoying to walk out-
side and be covered in sweat," she
said. "It's the humidity."

UF CROSS COUNTRY
Gators head to site of nationals for Pre-NCAA Invitational
By JESSICA ETTER
Alligator Writer
As the Gators prepare for the Pre-
NCAA Invitational on Saturday in Terre
Haute, Ind., training has tailed off for the
runners who will travel for the meet.
"It's time to start going into meets a
little fresher than we have been," coach
Todd Morgan said. "We have been train-
ing hard for months and months."
The No. 9 women's team will compete
in the White Race, which will include run-
ners from No. 1 Washington, No. 5 Princ-
eton as well as eight other top-30 ranked
teams.
Teams were divided into two races, the
White Race and the Blue Race, for men andfor women, respectively. The teams were
chosen for each race based on regional
rankings.
"It's a strong squad," Morgan said of
the women's team. "Rebecca (Lowe), Char-
lotte (Browning) and Genevieve (LaCaze)
are running well. Kaitlin (Shiver), Laura
(Garrow) and Julie (Northrup) are strong
runners too. Stacey (Johnson) started out
great and we anticipate her on getting bet-
ter. We have such a great team this sea-
son.'
There will be four teams from the South
Region, including Florida, competing in
the White Race. Alabama, Georgia, Jack-
sonville and Georgia Tech will run during
the 12:55 p.m. race as well. Florida will
face these teams during NCAA South Re-gionals on Nov. 14.
This will be the first meet of the season
where the women will run a 6K rather
than a 5K.
The men's team is
coming off a second-place
finish at the FSU Invita-
tional and will run dur-
ing the Blue Race against
nine top-30 teams during
their 8K, including No.
Morgan 2 Northern Arizona and
No. 3 Alabama.
Junior Anthony Morales said the team
is focused and ready to run for Pre-Nation-
als. Morales said it took the men awhile to
understand they controlled their own des-
tiny."I think we were having trouble realiz-
ing that Jeremy (Criscione) isn't here any-
more," he said. "Plus Sean is injured. It's
hard working without the guys who were
the leaders before."
Sean Blaney, who has not raced this
season, will be back next year. Morgan
said the senior will redshirt this season af-
ter suffering a stress fracture at the end of
the track season.
Blaney is running but has missed too
much training to race this season, accord-
ing to Morgan.
The NCAA Invitational will be held at
the LaVern Gibson Course in Terre Haute
on Nov. 23.
If the teams qualify, the women will run
a 6K and the men would run a 10K.
UF tallied two 100-yard
rushers in 2008 matchup
FOOT, from page 17
Andrew Stanfill Alligator
Coach Urban Meyer said the Razorbacks are one of the hottest teams in the nation right now. Arkansas
upset Auburn last week at home.
DIFER, from page 17
was cracking jokes.
I'll never forget what it was like
to look up at the stands that night
with the lights shining down on
Death Valley.
We can become so focused onthe smallest details that we forget
the big picture.
Saturday is homecoming. It's
Arkansas and Ryan Mallett. It's
Tebow and the Gators.
But really, at least for us stu-
dents, it's not the game we'll re-
member years from now.It's the barbecues and the tail-
gates. It's Gator Growl and the af-
ter parties. It's the friends and the
memories.
Don't be too cool or too proud
to do something you'll remember.
Go to the game. Go to Growl.
It doesn't matter that you mightbest passing offense, led b
first-year transfer starter Ryai
Mallett and love to throw i
around with an average of 3
pass attempts per game.
The Gators feature the na
t & ion's top passing defense an
can't wait for a shot at stop
ping Arkansas' aerial attack.
"We like teams that air i
out," Florida cornerback Jo
Haden said. "We don't look a
it like a bad thing. We look a
it like a good thing from all th
chances for us to make plays.
"We're just trying to ge
our interceptions up."
When UF has the ball, i
looks like much more of a mis
match.
Florida ranks No. 2 in thStaff country in rushing offens
(284.6 yards per game) while
Arkansas checks in at No. 7
not like the band or you think the
comedian is stupid.
Who cares if Florida is better
than Arkansas and the game will
probably be over by halftime?
It's not about that.
Go sit in the stands and be with
friends. Go look up at the lights ofy nationally in stopping the
ni run.
t Last year, the Gators faced
7 the Razorbacks a week after a
loss and began to heat up of-
-fensively.
I UF had a pair of 100-yard
-rushers (Jeff Demps and Chris
Rainey) in a 38-7 victory that
t included 21 unanswered
e points in the fourth quarter in
t Fayetteville.
t This year, Meyer expects a
e tougher matchup.
"We're playing one of the
t hottest teams in the coun-
try right now," Meyer said.
t "We're playing a team that
-physically beat Auburn basi-
cally every which way.
e "We saw this coming last
e year. We saw the improve-
e ment happening through the
3 year."
Florida Field. Don't be afraid to
get swept up in something great.
There's a reason thousands of
alumni come back every year.
In the end, the memories are
the things that we keep with us
forever. Don't let them pass you
by.

KICKOFF: Saturday 3:30 p.m.
TV/RADIO: CBS/WRUF AM850
This year we decided to invite UF
beat writers from some of the major
newspapers in Florida to increase
the competition level of the alliga-
torSports Brand Picks Column.
Through the first six weeks of the
season, it is obvious we were better
off without them.
Only the Gainesville Sun's Ed-
ward Aschoff is in the top half of the
standings.
The Palm Beach Post's Ben Volin
finally had a week above .500, but
will need to do a lot more to get out
of the bottom table. Joe Goodman of
the Miami Herald appears to be try-
ing to battle Volin for last place after
going 2-8 last week.
Maybe they can make a move to
catch up to us younglings with this
week's slate of games.
Instead of arguing the obvious
choice of Oklahoma against Texas,
we will be having a go at the Rut-
gers-Pittsburgh game.
RUTGERS WILL WIN BECAUSE. Tom
Savage is Rutgers' quarterback. He
is a true freshman, but he is the sec-
ond coming of the great Mike Teel.
RU coach Greg Schiano single-
handedly cost the Scarlet Knights
their only loss by not having enough
faith in the freshman and starting
the game with Domenic Natale, who
threw three interceptions in the loss
to Cincinnati.
Since then, RU has walked all
over powerhouses such as How-
ard, Florida International and Texas
Southern.
Unfortunately, Natale had to step
in for Savage for a game after he suf-
fered a Tebow-like concussion, but
he is back and ready to put his name
in the Heisman talk with a dominate
performance against Pitt. It won't
hurt that he has a strong running
game and defense to help out.UF looks to avoid homecoming letdown
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator org
In its quest to repeat as national champi-
ons, there is one thing Florida hopes not to
duplicate.
A loss.
The No. 1 Gators (5-0, 3-0 Southeastern
Conference) have lost to an SEC West foe at
least once during each of their last 10 sea-sons.
A year ago, Ole Miss came into The
Swamp unranked and left with one of the
biggest upsets of 2008.
This time it will be Arkansas (3-2, 1-2
SEC) trying to catch UF in a "trap game," a
week after Florida's primetime win at then-
No. 4 LSU.
"I think you're dealing with 18-to-22
year olds, so if you don't have a lot of good

lenge of going up against the SEC's top passing offense Saturday.leadership and a lot of focus on your team, I
think you can have letdowns," quarterback
Tim Tebow said. "That happens all the time
in college football. You have a more tal-
ented team that loses to a team that should
never beat them. That happens a lot."
It will be more difficult for the Razor-
backs to have the element of surprise this
year, though.
Arkansas upset then-No. 17 Auburn 44-
23 last week.
Last year, Ole Miss came to Gainesville
on Sept. 27 with a 2-2 record and directly
on the heels of a home loss to Vanderbilt.
Florida had won 30-26 at Tennessee the
week before.
"This is a team that's good enough
to compete for the West (Division)
Championship."
Urban Meyer
UF football coach
That experience should help keep UF fo-
cused as well as the fact that coach Urban
Meyer says this Arkansas team has shown
its talent, as opposed to 2008 Ole Miss that
hadn't hit its stride yet.
"I'd believe (it's a trap game) if it was
a Ole Miss," Meyer said. " We knew they
were good, but you watch film and they're
not playing very well yet. I don't think this
one falls into that.
"This is a team that's good enough to
compete for the West (Division) Champion-
ship."
The game also will feature SEC leaders
in two opposing categories.
The Razorbacks boast the conference's

s reporters, we spend alot of our time looking
down.
We look down on players: Is
Tim Tebow at practice? Is he go-
ing to play? Why didn't he play
well? What's wrong with the re-
ceivers?
We look down on coaches:
Why didn't he play John Brant-
ley? Why isn't Emmanuel Moody
getting the ball? Why aren't they
throwing it more?
We look down on fans: How
could they possible think that?
They don't know what they're
talking about. How could they
possibly disagree with our opin-ions?
We spend so much time criti-
cizing and analyzing and specu-
lating that we forget what it feels
like to look up. We forget what
made us love sports to begin
with.

at Tiger Stadium last Saturday
making some kind of half-jok-

not David Nelson had actually

PICKS, from page 18
After the Scarlet Knights take down the Panthers, it will just be a
waiting game for Cincinnati's eventual collapse, and it will be on to a
BCS game for RU.
-BOBBY CALLOVI
PITTSBURGH WILL COVER THE -3.5 POINT SPREAD BECAUSE. Look, I'll
be honest. I know nothing about this game.
My pick is made out of pure loathing toward Bobby Callovi.
When Bobby handed me the list of picks this week, written in cray-
on, I brushed aside the smears of edible Play-Doh and held it up to
the light so I could read it through the watercolor paint he had spilled
on it.
Just beside the macaroni picture of a five-legged dog, Bobby had
scrawled " utgers vs. Pittsbug," and it was the easiest pick of the week
for me to make.
I can't take shots at Bobby for liking a smaller team, but there's
only room for one underdog fan-favorite in our office, and the second-
best football school in New Jersey (after Duke) isn't it.
All of Rutgers wins this year have come against abysmal oppo-
nents, and RU quarterback Tom Savage is going to get knocked into
next week by the Panthers' defensive line as Pitt rolls to a win.
-MIKE McCALL
Now on to the picks!
Still holding on to the top spot with a 33-26 record is Mike "Do
you know what I am saying?" DiFerdinando, who became a man this
week, then ditched his journalism career to start a "kissing company"
and got out of the business just in time to avoid being caught by the
South Park Police.
Tied for second with a record of 30-29 is Ed "I'm so lonely" As-
choff, who will be trying to sneak into Gator Growl so he won't have
to stay home all by himself Friday night because the few friends he
has will be at world's largest student-run pep rally.
Also, in second is Bobby "Did you see the look in Charlie Strong's
eyes? " Callovi, who apparently noticed something special about the
UF defensive coordinator's eyes. Yeah, we don't look that hard ei-
ther.
The first of three writers tied at 29-30 for fourth place is Phil "Nofun " Kegler, who admits he has no sense of humor. He's right.
Next up in four hole logjam is Kyle "There's a curb there" Maistri,
who on the way to Baton Rouge drove his Honda Civic over a parking
chock, causing an hour delay in the trip.
The last of the three in fourth is Mike "Florida's too good" Mc-
Call, who stands by his point that UF's 13 points against LSU was a
beatdown.
In seventh place with a 26-33 record is the Orlando Sentinel's Jer-
emy "Baby face" Fowler, who makes sure to point out when us Al-
ligator writers haven't shaved in a couple days. Sounds to me like he
is just jealous of our facial hair, but don't worry Jeremy being able to
grow a beard doesn't make you a real man. Who am I kidding? Yes,
it does.
Down in eighth place with a 25-34 record is Florida Times-Union's
Mike "I'm just taking the odds, man" DiRocco, who will be paying
for an AP writer's dinner after agreeing to a bet that Dan Werner and
Chandler Parsons would play in the back court together this season.
From the Miami Herald in ninth place with a 22-37 record is Joe
"Good job" Goodman, who I still refuse to say anything negative
about. Keep up the great work, Joe.
Finally in dead-ass last place with a 17-43 record is Palm Beach Post
writer Ben "Go Gators" Volin, who let his true colors out by donning
a shirt with orange and blue that looked a lot like UF apparel at the
basketball team's media day, and I thought he was supposed to be
unbiased.

Walker steps in as starting PG
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
During the offseason, Billy
Donovan warned Erving Walker
the upcoming season would be the
toughest of the point guard's life.
Without Nick Calathes leading
the Gators on the court, the sopho-
more will be counted on to help fill
Calathes' shoes and take control of
Florida's backcourt this year.
"Nick made the game pretty easy
for him," Donovan said. "There was
always a level of relief and pressure
there because he handled the ball
all the time. There were some things
Nick did for Erving that made him
better. I think Erving will embrace
and take on the challenge that he's
got in front of himself right now."
Walker will move to his natural
position at point guard after play-
ing off the ball last season.
While replacing Calathes' 17.2
points, 6.4 assists and 5.3 rebounds
per game won't fall entirely on
Walker, UF doesn't have much
backcourt depth to back him up.
But Walker isn't shying away
from the increased role he'll play
this season.
"I've never heard of a player that
complained about playing a lot ofminutes," Walker said. "That was
my natural position in high school,
so I'm not uncomfortable with that.
There's definitely an adjustment at
the college level, but that's where
I'll be this year."
Before signing freshman Nimrod
Tishman, the Gators had only three
scholarship guards on their roster:
Walker, sophomore Ray Shipman
and freshman Kenny Boynton, who
is expected to immediately become
an impact scorer for UF.
Having lost Jai Lucas (transfer)
early last season, Walter Hodge
(graduation) and Calathes (pro ca-
reer), Donovan had trouble find-
ing another guard during the later
months of the recruiting season.
He successfully landed Tishman
out of high school in Israel, but the
program is still jumping through
hoops to get the point guard eligi-
ble to play once the season starts.
"He's clear and eligible to prac-
tice, but if we were to play tomor-
row, he would not be cleared to
play," Donovan said. "It's a pro-
cess our school has to go through,
and when that process gets done,
it's probably more in the NCAA's
hands."
At this point, Donovan said,
all signs point to Tishman being
cleared to play by UF's first gameon Nov. 2. The process is still on-
going, however, and the NCAA
Clearinghouse still has to make a
ruling.
Donovan is still keeping the
hype in check, as he said the most
he expects out of Tishman is to take
some of the strain off his starters
and run the offense for a few min-
utes per game in relief of Walker
and Boynton.
"We want to run and press and
do those things, but we've also
got to create situations during the
course of the year where both of
those guys, who could potentially
be two of our better scorers, are
not just worn down coming down
the stretch of games where we may
need their scoring," Donovan said.
Should Tishman be ruled ineli-
gible -or one of Florida's guards
suffers an injury or gets into foul
trouble -Donovan has a contin-
gency plan. Junior forward Chan-
dler Parsons or senior forward Dan
Werner could slide into the two-
guard role.
"We can go big. We can go
small. We can put me and Dan in
the backcourt. We can put me and
Dan in the frontcourt," Parsons
said. "We can do different things
with different guys, so I definitely
think it'll benefit us."Anarew sann / migator stan
UF guard Erving Walker will move back to his natural position this
season after the departure of Nick Calathes.

Freshmen adjust
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@aIIigator org
Christal Caldwell has prac-
ticed basketball before.
But not like this. Not at the
college level.
The conditioning during
the summer between high
school and college was some-
thing she had to get used to.
"It was nothing I couldn't
handle," she said. "But it was
a lot that I hadn't seen be-
fore."
The adjustment period con-
tinues today as the UF wom-
en's basketball team opens the
season with its first official
day of practice.
The team sentiment was
that practice ushers in the new
season and now, after weeks
of weight training and pick
up games during the sum-
mer and fall, the team will be
able to develop its structure in
practice.
Steffi Sorensen said she
would have to wait until af-
ter this season to rest and the
summer was all about getting
into top physical shape.
And while the players will
feel the physical burden with
the start of practice, it'll be the
mental game that's exercised
the most.
Heading into practice,
Caldwell said she's ready
thanks to some forewarning
from the seniors. They cau-
tioned against turnovers in
practice and stressed that the
freshmen were expected to
pick up on the game sooner
rather than later.With a younger and newer-
looking team than UF coach
Amanda Butler has had,
practice serves as a showcase
of skills and competition for
playing time, especially with
a guard-heavy team.
Transfer Jordan Jones may
be the most anxious for prac-
tice. Coming from South Caro-
lina, Jones sat out last year per
NCAA transfer rules. With a
year off to focus on herself,
Jones is ready to begin her UF
career.
And that starts with prac-
tice.
"I don't know what I'll be
saying when it's two and a
half hours in and my legs are
hurting, but I'm so ready for
the season to get going," she
said.
There's also the unspoken
standard Butler is bringing
to the program. In just two
years, Butler already matched
the school record for wins in
a season (24), and it's a trend
the seniors want to uphold.
Sorensen said Butler want-
ed the team to hold itself to a
standard of excellence, regard-
less of what outsiders say.
"We have an expectation to
really go out with a bang," se-
nior Susan Yenser said.
She said the team wants to
build on what it did last year
while attempting to raise the
bar.
Sophomore Trumae Lucas
said the bare minimum for the
team's desired performance
is last year's outcome. After
spending the offseason work-
ing and tweaking last year's
weaknesses, Lucas predictedto college game
the team would be quick in the dangerous team from the out-
post and with its guard play, side, the Gators will be still be

Strained relationship with media limiting coverage of superstar linebacker
Really like Brandon Spikes.
He's the best linebacker in
the nation, the leader of the best
defense in the nation, and he's nice,
honest and funny in interviews. The
holy trinity of qualities a sportswrit-
er looks for in an athlete.
It seems, however, that Brandon
Spikes isn't too fond of me.
Well, not me personally, but me
in that I'm a member of the media.
You see, we have not been able
to interview Spikes since Aug. 15.
That's two full months ago.
"Some players have different
levels of comfort with the media,"
team spokesman Steve McClain
said. "He's not real outspoken. He's
not one of those rah-rah guys. He's
not treating the media a whole lot
different."
There's a misconception out
there that we get to walk through
the locker room and talk to whom-
ever we want during media oppor-
tunities, and while that may be the
case in the NFL, it's simply not how
things work in college.
Every day after practice, a con-
tingent of media members gather

508 8th Ave.end zone of The Swamp and wait
for players to come out of the locker
room (always escorted by a member
of the team's media relations staff).
We put in player requests to the
media relations staff, which goes
and asks the requested players if
they would like to come talk to us.
This is where we hit a snag in the
process with Spikes, who evidently
is upset with the media for an inci-
dent that happened in the past.
Honestly, I can't say I blame him.
Things are blown up in the media
all the time, taken out of context and
spun in to something it was never
meant to be.
The thing I don't like about the
way this college media systemworks
is Spikes doesn't have to come out,
face the press and say he's not go-
ing to talk to us. That's what he'll
have to do at the next level, but for
now he's able to hide behind those
locker-room doors in the south end
zone. I even think if he were to come
out and talk to us, maybe the issue
would be cleared up altogether.
"We spend time with them tell-
ing them (talking to the media) is an
educational opportunity," McClainsaid. "And
like any other
educational
opportunity,
some people
chose to deal
Kyle Maistri with them
Kyle Points in different
kma istri@alligator org ways.",
Unfortu-
nately, the
way our interviews have been shap-
ing up with the defensive side of the
ball, it leaves us in a bad spot for
writing stories about that unit.
Spikes chooses not to talk to us
altogether now, and defensive co-
ordinator Charlie Strong doesn't
exactly like to chat it up with record-
ers in his face, making it hard on
us since Urban Meyer has taken to
deferring any defensive questions to
his coordinator.
The only true go-to quote guy for
the defense has been redshirt senior
linebacker Ryan Stamper. He comes
out day after day, wades through
five-to-10 minutes of questioning
varying from poignant to badgering
to insightful to stupid.

come out with some regularity and
always have a smile on their face.
I respect all three of those guys
immensely for representing their
teammates in the media the best they
can -for better or worse -but I
don't think it's right that the undis-
puted leader of the defense doesn't
feel a responsibility to come out and
take some of the media pressure off
his teammates.
The offense is loaded with guys
who come out and talk all the time,
from David Nelson to Jeff Demps to
the Pounceys.
Not to mention a twice-per-week
showing from Tim Tebow, and the
fact that Meyer is an offensive coach
by nature.
It isn't mandatory for any of the
players to come talk to the media at
any time, and I completely respect
that. I try to be as appreciative and
respectful of their time as I possibly
can, though I realize it isn't always
that way.
There was a time in my short
three months covering the football
team that reporters have fought with
each other while players remainedin the interview room.
On more than one occasion, re-
porters voiced displeasure with be-
ing brought a less-than-superstar
player right in front of said player's
face.
Or expressed discontent with a
player's inability to answer a ques-
tion in the manner the reporter had
hoped mid-interview.
At the same time, as writers, we
have a job to write what we can
based on who is willing to come talk
to us, no matter how unprofessional
members of the horde act some-
times.
A player recently suggested to
me that I write a huge story on how
sweet Spikes is rather than another
article on Tebow.
He was surprised to learn
that we haven't talked to the
All-American in two months.
His teammates -and I'm sure the
fans -want to hear from Brandon
Spikes.
And I would love to be the one to
write about what he has to say.
Unfortunately, I fear our strained
relationship might be beyond re-
pair.

NCAA CONFERENCE REALIGNMENT
A complete revamping of conferences with playoff system
By BOBBY CALLOVI, KYLE MAISTRI,
MIKE DIFERDINANDO, MIKE McCALL,
HARRISON DIAMOND
Alligator Staff
Simply creating a college football play-
off system would have been too easy for
our alligatorSports staff. Sure, the NCAA
brass doesn't seem to be able to work out
a formula for determining a champion on
the field of play, but that was the easy part
of this whole process for us.
It only took a 10-hour car ride home
from Lexington, Ky., for four of our foot-
ball writers and one of our photographers
to come up with a complete realignmentfor college football.
The criteria for grouping teams was
easy: start with matchups we simplyhave
to have every year (there was no way we
were breaking up pre-existingconference
rivalries and we even added some like
moving FSU and Miami intothe same con-
ference with Florida), account for regional
proximity and break any ties with how we
feel the competitive balanced would be.
We added some doormats (sorry South-
ern Miss, Hawaii and Tulane), but ulti-
mately, we feel this system champions
utilitarianism -the greatest good for the
greatest number.
There are now seven 12-team BCS con-
ferences (Southeastern, Pacific, Atlantic,Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, Longhorn
and Mid-American) each playing a con-
ference championship game yielding an
automatic bid into our eight-team playoff
system.
The four nine-team, non-BCS confer-
ences (Southern, Northern, Midwest and
Southwest Athletic) will determine a
champion during the regular-season slate
and play a four-team playoff of the cham-
pions to earn the right to the last bid. Their
schedules will be a game shorter than the
BCS teams to account for the extra game in
the additional four-team playoff.
Obviously the sponsors will be mad
about our doing away with the major
bowls, so we did our best to accommodatethem as well.
Each of the four major bowl committees
(Fiesta, Orange, Rose and Sugar) will have
one of the first-round games every year,
and they will be on a four-year rotation
with the two seminfinal games, the nation-
al championship game and an off year.
Whichever bowl committee is left out
(the Orange Bowl in our example) will
have first pick of their first round game for
that year. (See mock playoff on the next
page)
The following is an air-tight plan that
surely would have been signed off on by
President Barack Obama, had we asked for
his approval.

Florida faces crucial road trip against Auburn, Georgia
* UF IS NOT THE TOP-
RANKED SEC TEAM.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
The Gators' run at a 19th-
straight conference title is now
out of their control.
No. 9 Florida (12-3, 6-2
Southeastern Conference) will
enter the weekend as the third-
best team in the conference, one
match behind LSU and two be-
hind SEC leader Kentucky in
the loss column.
On Friday, UF will embark
on a critical two-match road
trip as it travels to Alabama to
take on Auburn (11-7, 3-4 SEC)
at 7 p.m. before heading to Ath-
ens to face Georgia (11-7, 2-5
SEC) on Sunday.
"The only thing we lost is
the ability to control our own
destiny," coach Mary Wise
said. "We can't control what
Kentucky does. They have a
two-match lead. All we can do
is control what we do."
However, one more confer-
ence loss not only damages the
Gators' hopes at a 19th-straight
conference title, but it also
would be their third SEC loss of
the season. It would be the first
lime UT has had more than two
conference losses under Wise.
"I'm kind of in a differentsituation that I've ever been in,"
senior libero Elyse Cusack said.
"Now, we have no room for er-
ror, and we just have to buckle
down because this is it."
After being swept by LSU
on Sunday, the Gators fell in the
rankings and are now ranked
one spot below No.8 Kentucky.
This is the first time since 1994
that UF is not the top-ranked
SEC team.
"It's a wake-up call," soph-
omore outside hitter Kristy
Jaeckel said. "We haven't been
in this position since I've been
on the team. I just think what
we do from here on out will de-
fine us as a team."
This weekend's matches will
be the final two of the toughest
six-match stretch of the season,
Wise said.
Three of the first four teams
the Gators have played during
that stretch have been ranked in
the top 20 of the RPI rankings
-LSU, Kentucky and Tennes-
see.
UF holds a 2-2 record dur-
ing that stretch so far and needs
to win both of its upcoming
matches to come away with
a winning record during that
time.
"Really, our ultimate goal is
the NCAA tournament," Cu-
sack said. "As long as we are
putting ourselves in the best
position to win in December -
we are excited about that."UF libero Elyse Cusack is in a different situation than her first three years in Gainesville. The Gators are not the
top-ranked SEC team and don't control their own destiny in the conference title race.
SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE
Kiffin takes subtle jab at Meyer
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdiando@alligator org
Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin
ruffled feathers in Gainesville this
week when he took what some
perceived as another subtle shot
at UF coach Urban Meyer.
Kiffin said he thought Ala-
bama's Nick Saban, and not
Meyer, was the best coach in the
Southeastern Conference.
"They've done an unbelievable
job with back-to-back national re-
cruiting titles. They're playing un-
believable," Kiffin said. "They're
so well-coached. I would think
they're the best-coached team in
the conference."
Kiffin also praised quarterback
Jonathan Crompton's 310-yard,
four-touchdown performance
against Georgia.
Crompton had never thrown
for more than 200 yards against
an SEC defense.
It was also the first time he
had thrown multiple touchdownpasses in a conference game.
SNEAD FORCING THINGS: Ole
Miss quarterback Jevan Snead
has struggled to live up to the
preseason hype. The Rebels
signal caller has thrown as many
touchdowns (nine) as intercep-
tions this season.
Coach Hous-
ton Nutt believes
Snead is making
mistakes be-LS\I cause he's feel-
ing pressure to
make plays.
Nutt "In the fastest
league in Ameri-
ca,youcan'tforcethings,"Nuttsaid.
The Rebels are also feeling the loss
of first-round draft pick Michael
Oher. Without Oher at left tackle,
the Ole Miss offensive line has
given up eight sacks this year.
Other's replacement, Bradley
Sowell, has struggled to protect
Snead's blind side.
"There's no question (that we
miss Oher)," Nutt said. "But youdon't have him. I've been proud
of how far Bradley Sowell has
come."
WI LDCATS ADJUST WITH UT HAR-
TLINE: Kentucky will be without
quarterback Mike Hartline for
Saturday's game against Auburn
as he recovers from an injury to
the MCL in his left knee.
The Wildcats' biggest play-
maker, sophomore Randall Cobb,
was effective in the Wildcat
package against South Carolina
and played quarterback in high
school.
But coach Rich Brooks said he
would prefer not to put Cobb un-
der center.
Junior Will Fidler will more
than likely get the call against the
Tigers.
Without Hartline, Kentucky
will probably lean on its running
game, especially tailback Derrick
Locke, this week.
"If you can't throw it, it's go-
ing to be a heck of a lot harder to
run it," Brooks said.

UF avoids pressure
of playing perfectly
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
Florida coach Urban Meyer isn't much of a perfectionist.
That's not to say his team doesn't practice under metic-
ulous standards with lofty expectations, but Meyer said he
doesn't want the Gators to feel like they have to play a perfect
game every time out.
"I think Lou Holtz says it best, 'You've just
gotta be the best team in the stadium on that
Saturday,' and that's our job in two days,"
Meyer said.
Football Though there have been many questions
about the offense after UF scored 13 points
against LSU last Saturday and 23 points against
Tennessee on Sept. 19, Meyer and offensive coordinator Steve
Addazio said the offense is doing enough to win and that's
what counts.
"The No. 1 goal is to go win the football game," Addazio
said. "Your defense is playing their tail off and we controlled
-we almost had double the time of possession that they had
-and that's a team win like that."

Setting Up Shop
Junior Rodgers makes instant adjustment to UF
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@alligator org
Three weeks after deciding to transfer to
Florida, Brynja Rodgers packed everything
she had in a U-Haul trailer, hooked it to the
back of her 1998 Toyota Camry and drove
across the country on her own.
Brynja arrived at UF during the first week
of August following two years at New Mexico
State to take an opportunity she viewed as
simply too good to pass up.
The chance to play for Florida, a nationally
recognized volleyballprogramwith 18 straight
Southeastern Conference Championships to
its credit, was a dream come true. That's not to
say it wasn't tough leaving the comfortable re-
lationships she had worked to establish in Las
Cruces, N.M., some 1,400 miles away from her
hometown of Iowa City, Iowa.
"For two years, I made very deep connec-
tions with the people in New Mexico. I figured
that I would always have those connections
with those people, I would always be in a
close relationship with my friends back there,"
Brynja said. "If I can do that with those people
in two years, let's go to Florida, let's take ev-
erything you own, just go to Florida and make
brand new connections with some other brand
new people."
The more than 1,600-mile drive from Las
Cruces to Gainesville gave Brynja plenty of
time to think about the life she was leaving
behind, the new one awaiting her at UF and
the series of events that took her from one to
the other.
The Telephone Game
Had Cindy Bathelt, the Gators' starting set-
ter last season, not decided to transfer to the
University of Colorado at Colorado Springs in
June, Brynja could have been taking the court
for the Aggies this year.
With Florida's 2008 assists leader on her
way out, UF coach Mary Wise had to pursue
an immediate substitute to keep her team's
6-2 offense running. Given the prestige of the
Florida program and the quick learning pro-
cess the setter would have to undergo, Wise
had a right to be selective.
"Sometimes in coaching, you just have to
be a little lucky, and in June, when we found
out that Cindy Bathelt wasn't returning, we
thought the luck had run out," Wise said.
"But Brynja's situation, looking to play some-
where else, all of the stars lined up and fell into
place."
Brynja didn't exactly come calling to Wise.
Finding her came as a result of the UF coach-
ing staff's exhaustive search, some fortunate
connections and a lot of time on the phone.
Wise spoke with her fellow volleyball
coaches and friends, asking if they knew of
any available setters who would fill the hole
at UT. Fortunately, the needle-in-the-haystack
scenario played out perfectly, as Brynja had
run the 6-2 at NMSU.
One thing stood in the way, though: Brynja
wasn't considering transferring. At least she
didn't know she was.
Kyla Rodgers, Brynja's mother, was on the
phone with John Tawa of PrepVolleyball.com,
discussing the Iowa Rockets club she and her
husband run, when she brought up her daugh-
ter. Brynja loved everything about the Aggies
and Las Cruces -and she was content at the
time to remain there. But she wasn't on schol-
arship, and the financial strain was becoming
something of an issue for her family.
"She was the only one on her team there
for Thanksgiving, because she couldn't afford
to go home when she went to New Mexico
State," Kyla said. "She knew it. She knew whatwas going on."
Kyla told Tawa that Brynja was available,
and Tawa relayed that information when UF
assistant coach Ken Ko contacted him.
Looking to learn more about Brynja, Wise
went to Iowa's Sharon Dingman, who coaches
players from the Rodgers' club.
Wise then got in touch with NMSU coach
Mike Jordan, who spoke to Brynja about the
offer.
"His first question was, 'Brynja, do you
know who Mary Wise is?' Brynja said. "And
I was like, 'Coach, who doesn't know who
Mary Wise is?'"
Making the Call
In direct contrast to the long, winding road
that led Wise to her newest player, Brynja only
had to make a few calls once her future coach
gave her the opportunity to play at UF.
She called her parents, unsure of what to
do. NMSU had become her home away from
home, but UF had everything she wanted. She
would be a scholarship student-athlete on a
nationally recognized team with a chance to
make an NCAA Tournament run.
"David and I both said, 'Brynja, you weigh
the pros and cons. You make the decision,"'
Kyla said. "She called us back, I think a day lat-
er, and said, 'I've decided to go to Florida."'Despite the strain of not being on scholar-
ship at NMSU, her parents told Brynja to make
the decision independent of financial concerns.
When she called David and Kyla, Brynja had
made the list of pros and cons without money,
but the decision remained the same.
"She said Florida simply wins," Kyla said.
A number of the factors in the Gators' fa-
vor were related to Wise: her reputation as a
highly respected female coach, her enthusi-
asm for and knowledge of setting, the nine
All-America setters she has coached, the seven
Final Four appearances in the last 18 years un-
der Wise and, most importantly, the way she
dealt with Brynja when they spoke.
"If the switch wasn't going to make me
happy, then she was going to forget all about
it and let me be happy at New Mexico State,"
Brynja said. "Because she took the time to eval-
uate my situation and put herself in my shoes,
I think that showed some great character, and
it really helped me decide that this was going
to be a great place to play."
Less than a month after the offer, Brynja
called Wise to say she would become a Gator.
She finished the summer semester at NMSU
and drove to Gainesville on her own, joining
a Florida squad of 14 players who spent the
summer together on campus.
"That's so Brynja right there, just to drive
UF setter Brynja Rodgers spent two years at New Mexico State before deciding to
transfer. It was a perfect fit because NMSU runs the same 6-2 offense as Florida.across the country by herself -really inde-
pendent, really self-sufficient," junior Lauren
Bledsoe said. "She's been really positive about
it. That is a really hard thing to do -to leave
everything you know and come somewhere
new."
The downtime was so minimal that Brynja
hadn't even unpacked her U-Haul before she
was working with UF's training staff.
"I think the transition has been very hard
for her, and I don't think anyone will see it,"
Kyla said. "I don't think she'll show it. She just
won't. She's very tough."
Despite the quick turnaround, she found
instant success on the court. Brynja led the
team in assists in the first two matches of the
season and served a fifth-set, match-winning
ace against Florida State in the third.
She credited her teammates for helping her
cope with the immediate transition to a new
school, a new team and a new life.
"They -as well as Mary -took the time
to understand that I was brand-new, I had just
gotten here, I had made this decision literally
three weeks ago," Brynja said. "It was rushed,
but it wasn't bad by any means. I think they
did a good job of welcoming me."
Set to Coach
Although she relied on her teammates and
friends to help her acclimate to UF, Brynja has
had no trouble feeling at home on the court.
Whether it's before the serve, during play
or after the point, she has proven herself to be
one of the Gators' most vocal players despite
being the newest addition to the team.
Brynja said she talks more while playing
than she ever does off the court, but Bledsoe,
her roommate, chalked that up to just how
talkative she can be during a match.
"It's something we really need, so it kind of
fits perfectly," Bledsoe said. "It really helps as
far as leadership on the court."
Given the leadership role she has taken on
the court, her position as a setter and her fam-
ily's background in coaching, it's no surprise
Wise sees Brynja as a future coach.
"I can envision it. I just can't wait until
she envisions it," Wise said. "She would be a
terrific coach. Her respect for the game, how
much she loves to play -she would have the
ability to transcend that to younger players. I
really hope she goes into coaching."
Add in the fact that Brynja has been help-
ing her parents coach their club since she was
in high school, and her mother also views it as
an inevitability.
"I know she's a coach, and I know that
she's good at it," Kyla said. "She'll find it on
her own. She'll come to the realization that she
can't live without volleyball and that she has
to coach."
Although Brynja is considering entering
the field of dentistry after college, she ac-
knowledged her passion for coaching as well
as her family's background in volleyball.
"It's definitely something I love to do,"
Brynja said. "I like watching young children
figure out how to play the sport. I know I had
to do it at one time."
Already an upperclassman and one of
the team's most vocal players, Brynja seems
primed to take another step toward becom-
ing a coach next season, as she will be one of
four seniors responsible for leading a talented
nucleus of underclassmen.
"I love the fact that this team is young. I
love it," she said. "Not just because I'm one
of the oldest ones -and I am very nearly the
oldest one. The younger girls show incredible
potential.
"The places we can go if everyone keeps
getting better -it's through the roof."
Wherever the team may go, Brynja has al-
ready shown a willingness to take whatever
path put before her -even if it's a 1,600-mile
drive from Las Cruces to Gainesville.

Roommates lead way as UF prepares to face Tennessee
By TYLER JETT

They're the most dynamic fresh-
men duo under one roof.
And when Tennessee (7-5-2, 3-2-
1 Southeastern Conference) hosts
No. 11 Florida (10-4-1, 4-1-1 SEC) to-
night, the Volunteers back line will
need to keep tabs on the pair.
While many Gators freshmen
have been doing heavy lifting (al-
most half of the team's goals come
from first-year players), none have
impacted the offense as much as
midfielders and roommates Erika
Tymrak and Brooke
Thigpen.
With 13 points
each this season,
Soccer Thigpen and Tymrak
are tied for second on
the team behind for-
ward Lindsay Thompson.
Between the two, Tymrak has
made more noise since conference
play began Sept. 25. She has three
goals and three assists through six
conference games, and her play last
week earned her distinction as one
of the SEC's Players of the Week.
"She's a budding star in this
league," UF coach Becky Bur-
leigh said. "She's just so difficult to
mark."
After being a major factor in non-
conference play, Thigpen has been a
little quieter recently.
But that is not to say she has been
ineffective. Thigpen earned an assistin Florida's win against Alabama
when she threaded a pass between
three defenders to Thompson in the
penalty box. The strengths of the
freshmen are actually similar, Bur-leigh said. Both have the foot skills
to beat SEC defenders.
"Between the two of them, it's a
potent attack," Burleigh said.
And when working on weak-nesses in their game, the roommates
lean on each other.
"After the game we always talk
about what we can work on," Tym-
rak said. "We always watch video

UF midfielder Brooke Thigpen is tied for second on the team in points (13) with her roommate and fellow
midfielder Erika Tymrak.together, too."
Thigpen and Tymrak's compara-
ble playing styles might come from
the similar training they received in
high school. They played together
for five years in Florida's Olympic
Development Program.
Thigpen and Tymrak met after
being assigned to the same room at
an ODP camp because of similar last
names. They were roommates dur-
ing their five years in the ODP.
And each one knows the other's
style as well as anybody.
"She can probably dribble
through people," Thigpen said
about Tymrak. "She's so quick. She
probably has the fastest feet I've
ever seen."
Tymrak could publish a good
scouting report of Thipen, too.
"Her biggest strength is going
at people," Tymrak said about her
roommate.
When evaluating herself, Thig-
pen sees the same things Tymrak
does.
"I really take players on," Thig-
pen said. "I feel like that's my
strength."
In a sport where offensive suc-
cess is dependent on telekinesis-like
communication, having players
with long-standing relationships
can substantially impact a team.
"We played welltogether rightoff
the bat, even when we were young-
er," Thigpen said. "And I think that
as we grew up and learned each
other's strengths and weaknesses,
we got a lot better."
