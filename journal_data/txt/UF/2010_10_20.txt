ken the Guinness record for world’s longest 
domestic cat. 
The Reno Gazette-Journal reported that 
a 5-year-old Maine Coon named Stewie measured 48 1/2 inches from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail bone. Robin Hen-drickson and Erik Brandsness purchased the cat from a breeder in Hermiston, Ore., in 2005.
The previous record holder was another Maine Coon that measured 48 inches. It was owned by Frieda Ireland of Chicago.
Hendrickson said Maine Coons are one 
of the oldest natural breeds of cats and are known for their mellow, relaxed tempera-ments. She says they’re known as “the gen-tle giants” of the cat world.
Hendrickson said she and Brandsness 
decided to try for the record after hearing countless people said they were amazed by Stewie’s length.48.5- inch Nevada cat breaks record for longest domestic cat

In spite of the recession, Gainesville 
charities remain confident the upcoming 
fundraising season will be strong.
Local chapters of numerous national 
charities, including the United Way of 
North Central Florida and the Ronald Mc-
Donald House of Gainesville, have been 
finding new ways to remain active in the community, despite a decline in dona-tions.
“Things are down, but not as much as 
the recession proves it should be,” said Deborah Horvath, executive director of the Ronald McDonald House. “We’re still paying our bills, so I think things will be okay.”
Nationally, charities have experienced 
steep declines. The Philanthropy 400 re-port released Monday shows donations to the nation’s 400 biggest charities have decreased by 11 percent in the past year, the worst decline in 20 years.
However, a few national charities con-
tinue to bring in large donations, including United Way and Habitat for Humanity. 
The United Way of North Central 
Florida, based in Gainesville, brought in $8.5 million this past year through a com-
bination of volunteer work, donations of 
food and books and federal programs and grants. 
“For areas with sizes similar to ours, we’re second in the country,” said Mindy Underberger, vice-president for market-
ing and communications at the United 
Way. 
The fundraising season begins with the 
onset of the holiday season. Local chari-ties have begun looking at new outlets to spread the word about helping the com-munity. The Salvation Army has signed an agreement to receive donations by text 
message, while the Ronald McDonald 
House of Gainesville recently created a Fa-cebook page to promote upcoming events. According to Horvath, these actions alone do not necessarily lead to donations. 
However, for United Way, this season 
already appears to be a good one.
“From all the early results we’re seeing 
right now, we see that the community is 
very supportive and generous in spite of 
the economic times,” Underberger said. “We will be able to continue our support to the community.”Charities suffer in poor economy THE PAST TWO YEARS, TICKETS RAN 
OUT WITHIN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

Students did not have to scramble to purchase 
their tickets to the Florida-Georgia football game 
this year. 
According to ticket sales officials, tickets to the  
game usually sell out within minutes of going on 
sale. This year, however, tickets were still for sale hours after they became available. 
Mark Gajda, the assistant athletics director 
for ticket operations, said tickets for the Florida-Georgia game sold much slower this year than in previous years. 
“For 2008 and 2009 ticket sales went very quick, 
it was probably 10 minutes for the completion of 
the sale,” he said Tuesday. “This year it went to 
midnight and didn’t even sell out until this morn-
ing.” 
Senior John Tracy said he didn’t want to spend 
the money on a ticket and go all the way to Jack-sonville to watch the Gators lose another game. 
But buying a ticket to the game was nearly im-
possible last year, Tracy said. 
He said he got home from work last 
year at exactly 6:09 p.m. and logged online to purchase his Georgia tickets 
at 6:12 p.m. Ticket sales were open at 6 p.m., but the tickets were already sold out by the time he logged into the student lottery system.
“I was running a little late, but never thought I 
wouldn’t be able to get a ticket,” said Tracy. “In my mind there was no way that everyone was waiting at their computer for 6 p.m. to come.”
Tracy said that even though he didn’t get a 
ticket online, he still went to the game. All of his friends were going and he knew it was a big game 
for UF.
Ted Spiker, professor of the Sports and Media 
Society class at UF, said there are other reasons 
besides the three losses for why ticket sales have been down this year.
“This program has extremely high expectations, 
so when you don’t meet these expectations, then you’re going to see some sales suffer,” Spiker said. 
“You’re not winning. You’re not getting as much 
attention. You’re not getting as much interest.”Ticket sales

Friends of a Buchholz High School graduate 
who passed away are tweeting to remember. 
Anthony Taylor Minzie, 19, died early Saturday 
morning in his hometown of Gainesville, but his 
friends are using the social media tool to help his memory live on.
Minzie, who went by the nickname “Tizzy,” was 
a Taylor, the name given to fans of rap artist Wiz Khalifa, and he had VIP tickets for one of his con-certs.
As a freshman at Florida State University, Min-
zie had planned to go to the artist’s show on Nov. 3 in Tallahassee.
 His friends have been repeatedly tweeting mes-
sages to Khalifa, hoping that the 
rapper will agree  to give a shout- 
out to Minzie during the concert.
“It would be awesome if Wiz 
Khalifa could just give him a 
shout out for like two seconds,” 
said Santa Fe College student 
Brittney Kelly, who met Minzie over the summer. 
The two are “married” on Facebook, and she 
said that he was known for his positive outlook on 
life.
“I’ve literally never heard anything bad talked 
about him. Everyone loved him,” Kelly said.
She said that by Tuesday friends had sent more 
than 1,000 tweets to the artist. 
Most of the tweets are variations of this: “Give 
Tizzy a shout-out @ tally, FL show. He repped tay-
lor gang & passed away the 16th. It would mean the world.”
In addition to Twitter, some have chosen to get 
permanent reminders of Minzie by getting tattoos of his life motto, “Living the dream.”

� LAWTON M. CHILES ELEMENTARY AND THE ROCK 
SCHOOL WERE LOCKED DOWN FOR A FEW HOURS.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
Two west Gainesville schools were temporarily locked down 
Tuesday as the county sheriff’s office searched for the man who 
robbed a local store at gunpoint and has yet to be caught.
At about 11 a.m., the man walked into Haile Jewelry and 
Loans, at 2725 SW 91st St., and pointed a handgun at the clerk, according to ASO spokesman Art Forgey.
He demanded jewelry and ran away northward into a near -
by neighborhood. ASO searched the area with patrol cars and 
helicopters and had Lawton M. Chiles Elementary and the Rock 
School put on lockdown for a few hours, Forgey said.
ASO called neighborhood residents to tell them 
to be on the lookout; however, the man hadn’t been caught as of Tuesday night. The suspect is described as a 5’8” white man between 140 and 180 pounds.

 THEY WATCHED VIDEOS 
ON RECENT GAY SUICIDES.
By SAMANTHA LIEBHABER
Alligator Contributing Writer
About 50 students gathered 
in Orange and Brew on Tuesday 
night for guided discussions on 
culture in politics, in a open fo-rum titled “Politics of Silence.”
Student Government spon-
sored the forum, which cost about $200 to host.
Participants were shown vid-
eos related to the recent suicides of homosexual students who 
were struggling with discrimina-
tion. They also discussed race re-lations in politics and the planned constructions of an Islamic center near Ground Zero in New York City. 
Students were then asked to 
discuss their feelings about the issues and how they thought the issues relate to UF. 
Nirav N. Patel, a philosophy 
and geography junior, stood up and elaborated on the need for UF cultural organizations to interact more. 
“I feel like we’re still segregat-
ed here,” he said. “It sucks being in an old southern school.”
According to Romilda Justilien, 
director of multicultural affairs for SG, the purpose of the event was 
to advance social justice and raise 
awareness of other cultures. 
The aim is to make just one 
person more socially conscious so that he or she can promote it to friends and family, she said. 
“I think that we got some re-
ally great ideas that we want to implement,” Justilien said. 
Ching-Ya Ni, a Chinese and 
political science junior, said she came to the event to hear the po-litical opinions of students outside of  class. 
She said the event provided a 
good outlet for addressing multi-culturalism, but that it could have 
had more diversity. 
“I just wish there were more 
people so it could have been a bet-
ter discussion,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2010

Behind an unlit neon sign on 43rd Street, 
there’s a 25-year-old Gainesville institution. 
Paul Cakmis owns the place. He’s 61, round like Santa Claus but without the beard. When things were good — before the crash, the lay-
offs and the lists — the Gator football team 
would come and eat at the 43rd Street Deli.
When he was the king, and he sold one 
of his restaurants for an obscene amount of money , he had enough to put away to give his family a good life. Things were easy. 
But that nest egg he worked so hard to nur -
ture is running out. And not enough money is coming in.
“When you’re successful you take it for 
granted,” he said. “When the shit hits the fan it’s a whole different operation.”
Cakmis’ Greek immigrant parents were 
both restaurateurs, a word he uses with pride. One time his dad, a handshake man, bought him a black Schwinn Jaguar bike, then gave it to an orphanage because he didn’t keep up with chores. 
According to Cakmis, at one point his 
parents owned 30 different restaurants. They worked hard, long hours. His said his dad died from the stress, and his mom was stuck with the responsibility of the restaurants. The restaurants went like a “fire sale,” he said. 
He grew up, got married and then di-vorced. 
In 1983 he opened his first restaurant in 
downtown Gainesville. He was 35, and he learned what it took to run a business. How to treat customers. How to cook. At times he was a janitor and a maintenance man, but he was a restaurateur just like his dad.  
In 1986 he moved to his flagship location on 43rd Street. He remarried and continued work-ing. His wife worked, too, while pregnant. 
He had a philosophy about give-and-take 
with his customers.
“People want to feel important when they 
come into a restaurant,” he said. “And you want to make them feel good, because without them you’re nothing.”
His business grew, as good ones do, 
steadily over the years. But he couldn’t forget about his dad and all those res-
taurants in Ohio. He wanted more.  
After 10 years, he opened a restaurant on 13th 
Street. The students found him, the money found him, and Tim Tebow and the Gators found him, too. 
He would set up a breakfast buffet 
and close off the back of the restaurant for the football team. He loved that Ur -
ban Meyer, and before him, Steve Spur -
rier, were spending their money locally .  
Four years later he opened a third location at Williston Road and I-75.
“That’ll be a little goldmine in a few years.”  
Cakmis was the breakfast king. Three restau-rants. A nice house for his wife and kids and 
some nice cars. But three places meant triple the 
problems and a strain on the marriage. He went through a few managers because he kept catch-ing them stealing. His health started to flicker.  
In 2008, CVS wanted his real estate, and of-fered him buckets of money, so he sold. 
After all, hadn’t he been working 
hard all this time? Didn’t he deserve to put a little away for his wife and kids?  
He did well from the sale and didn’t notice at first when monthly profits started to drop.
One less restaurant meant fewer custom-
ers. Die-hards who came in four times a week only came once. Fewer students. Something was in the air.
“You could just tell people were tightening 
up with their money ,” he said. “You could just sense it.”
Deliveries got more expensive. Food 
prices started to spike. Then they soared.  
A gas surcharge and an insurance hike hit, 
while his income dropped by a third. The banks 
started having trouble and wouldn’t lend money anymore. He lost his left eye to a virus.  
Now he was living off the sale because no checks were coming in. His marriage was dissolving. He was drinking too much for a man his age. He had a heart attack.  
He didn’t want all those years of hard work to go to waste. He wanted to retire one day . He wanted to leave some money for his kids 
when he died. He had to cut his best em-
ployees’ hours. He had to lay some off. They trusted him, and he let them down. He felt the weight of the families who depended on him. He developed ulcers that burst in his belly.  
He had to compete with the dollar menu and the five-dollar footlong. 
He couldn’t sleep, so he started making lists. 
How much bacon did he need? How much 
cheddar? What could he afford? Who did he 
owe money to? He’d call and ask for more time.  
His is not the only business suffering. After 82 years in Gainesville, Louis’ Lunch will close later this month. The owner has blamed the recession and  nearby road construction. 
Similar construction on 43rd Street has dam-
aged Cakmis’ already fragile business, he said.  
Cakmis believes that people in Gainesville 
should spend their money here, in town. 
He’s not a corporation. He needs help.  
Today, he’s thankful for what he has: his wife, kids and grandkids. He’s even optimistic.
He believes it’s going to get better, but in 
the meantime, he’s going to deal with it the only way he knows how.
“I’m gonna wake up every day and come 
to work and bust my can.”
That’s how his dad did it, and that’s how 
he’s going to do it. There’s no time to feel sorry for himself. He has restaurants to run.

Catalan singer-songwriter Pau Alabajos performed for 
more than 75 people at the Thomas Center Tuesday night in celebration of Catalan culture and its constrained music scene. 
The department of Spanish and Portuguese Studies 
brought Alabajos and actress Susanna Sebastiá to Gainesville, as they are on their American tour.
Accompanied by  Sebastiá, Alabajos shared music from 
the “Nova Cançó,” a politically rebellious genre of music which arose during the 1960s and 1970s in Catalonia, a terri-tory belonging to Spain that struggles with its independent 
identity and its desire to be its own country. 
“You couldn’t give an explicit mes-
sage about what you thought politically in 
those times,” Alabajos said, “so people did it through music.” 
Although censorship reached its 
heights during Spain’s Franco era, Ala-bajos said playing music on the streets of Valencia will still land you a $500 fine and 
the confiscation of your instrument today. Alabajos said the city now bans the music 
as a misguided means of protecting its reputation, but he still plays to “catch the feeling” of the oppression the “Nova 
Cançó” musicians felt during Franco’s reign. 
“The image the government is trying to maintain is this 
very modern, conservative kind of image,” he said. “It 
doesn’t really work, though.”
Alabajos said the artistic expression of Catalan culture is 
more celebrated beyond its borders than within. Even UF’s Catalan program, with only 12 students enrolled in classes this fall, is a refreshing dose of enthusiasm about his and Sebastiá’s little-discussed culture.
“There’s really no space for musical expression in our 
country,” he said. “There’s this general censorship for those against the government. It’s a form of discrimination.”Catalan singer plays ‘politically rebellious’ music for 75

Florida Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Kendrick 
Meek, left, hugs former President Bill Clinton.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ST. PETERSBURG — Democratic Rep. 
Kendrick Meek brought former President 
Bill Clinton to town Tuesday to try to 
whip up some homestretch enthusiasm 
for his struggling U.S. Senate campaign.
The former president, still hugely 
popular among party members, told a crowd of more than 1,000 on the campus 
of the University of South Florida on St. 
Petersburg that Meek and other Demo-crats in Congress should be given more of a chance to clean up the mess made by 
the last Republican administration.
Republican leadership left the coun-
try’s economy in a hole, Clinton said, and 
they are now quick to criticize President Barack Obama and Democrats for not be-
ing able to climb out of it yet.
“You’re right, we didn’t get out of this 
hole,” Clinton said. “It was a very deep 
hole. But at least we stopped digging.”
He urged the college students in the 
crowd at the campus activities center to 
get out the vote for Meek. He warned 
that if Republicans regain control of Con-gress, they will take steps to make it more difficult to get and repay student loans.“Don’t you listen to this tea party talk 
about how (Republicans) are on your side,” said Clinton, who campaigned last week at another Southern college, the University of Mississippi.
Clinton said he felt so strongly about 
helping Meek prevail that he flew across the country after Monday campaign stops out West, arriving in Florida at 4 a.m.
Meek is in need of the help. Two 
weeks before the election, polls show the four-term South Florida congressman well behind Republican Marco Rubio 
and Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running as 
an independent.
Some Democrats have suggested 
Meek drop out of the race to give Crist a 
chance to beat the more conservative Ru-
bio, but Meek has refused. He noted that 
he withstood a barrage of attack ads and rallied to beat self-financed billionaire Jeff 
Greene in the Democratic primary.
“I will continue to work, I’ll continue 
to fight for you, and I’ll continue to give 
you a voice in the process,” Meek told the crowd hours before he was scheduled to 
participate in another debate with Ru-
bio and Crist on statewide TV Tuesday night.
Clinton said Meek should be elected 
to help keep Obama’s health care reform 
law intact and keep Congress from priva-
tizing Medicare. And Meek, he said, is the only one of the three candidates who 
has already worked in Congress to keep 
the country secure.
Clinton said his administration 
proved that Democratic principles are 
more effective.
“We’ve tested these ideas, theirs and 
ours, and ours worked better,” he said.
Before Clinton spoke, U.S. Sen. Bill 
Nelson told the crowd he needed Meek in Washington to help him keep gas and oil drilling rigs far away from Florida 
beaches.
Clinton is scheduled to appear with 
Meek at a rally Wednesday at the Univer -
sity of Central Florida in Orlando.Clinton campaign for Meek in Fla.
“I will continue to work, I’ll 
continue to fight for you, and 
I’ll continue to give you a voice 
in the process.”

Today’s question: Are you going 
to the Florida-Georgia game?
65 TOTAL VOTES54% YES46% NOTuesday’s question: Do you plan to cast your vote early for this election?Mad as a Hatter
If the Tea Party gets any 
more laughs, or gets any crazier, we’re going to 
have to start wondering if it’s Kool-Aid in their cups 
rather than chai. 
In a double dose of fun-
for-everyone laughter, two 
prominent Tea Party candi-dates made social blunders that make us wonder how anyone could want these lovely ladies to run our country.
Challenging current Sen-
ate Majority Leader Harry Reid, U.S. Senate candidate Sharron Angle said to a group of Hispanic students they looked “a little more Asian.” 
While we’ve never had 
the unfortunate circum-
stance of mistaking an Asian 
student for Hispanic, we’re even more astounded Angle thought this would be an appropriate thing to say to a group of Hispanic voters in the state she’s hoping to capture. 
And across the country 
in Delaware, our darling Tea Partier Christine O’Donnell 
asked a group of law stu-
dents where in the Constitu-tion is any mention of that whole church-and-state-sep-aration thing. 
More confused than 
Angle when she walks into Panda Express, O’Donnell had no choice but to smile in 
fear behind her water glass 
as the crowd of law students erupted in laughter.
As they should have.It’s ridiculous to suggest a 
major candidate, who is also seeking to claim the seat our current vice president once held, can serve effectively 
without having a most-basic 
knowledge of our governing document. 
What you learned at Hog-
warts won’t save you here, Christine.The day the (Rock 104) music died
Feb. 3, 1959. July 12, 1979. And now, Oct. 15, 2010. 
What do all three of these dates have in common? They’re all considered days when the music died. 
Feb. 3 will be forever immortalized in Don McLean’s 
“American Pie,” memorializing the plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and the Big Bopper. July 12 was Disco Demolition Night — a promotion at 
a Chicago White Sox game gone wrong that resulted 
in a near riot against disco. Oct. 15? Rock 104 signs off for the last time, and 103.7 The Gator signs on air with country music for Gainesville.
I’m not a person who considers himself a music snob 
or a rock exclusivist; I legitimately listen to everything. Yes, that includes country. 
But it’s a matter of checks and balances, and the 
death of Rock 104 significantly upsets the balance of the 
Gainesville music scene. 
There are now at least six country music radio sta-
tions that can be received in Gainesville, four being 
larger stations. 
When it comes to the modern rock that Rock 104 
broadcasted? Just one. There are more stations in the Gainesville/Ocala metropolitan market that broadcast Christian contemporary music than modern alternative rock ‘n’ roll. That’s just not right.
But wait a second, according to the powers that be, 
Rock 104 isn’t dead! It’s just available online now. It’s time to send a message to companies that continue to move stations online and pretend they still exist. Grant-ed, something’s better than nothing. 
But until I can receive Internet radio or HD radio eas-
ily and affordably in my car, where radio still reigns su-preme, although CD players and iPod docks are creep-ing up to kill it completely, Rock 104 is dead to me.
Furthermore, the actual signing 
off of Rock 104 isn’t the worst part. The format change leads to less diversity in the Gainesville radio spectrum, making the metropoli-
tan area less attractive to students 
who aren’t from the North Florida 
area, and aren’t getting to listen to Jimmy Eat World, Papa Roach or The Black Keys they’re used to listening to back home. 
Of course there’s no way to cater to every student’s 
interest. It’s safe to say we won’t see a dedicated world music station any time soon. 
However, 103.7 FM is registered to UF, and it should 
be in the best interest of the university to represent its student body as best possible.
Rock 104 was an enterprise that catered to, and was 
often run by, students. In contrast, 103.7 The Gator seems to be catering toward the local community. 
The ideal scenario for a university-operated radio 
station should be to provide quality content for its stu-dents, faculty and staff while also providing a public service to the local community. 
By becoming the eighth country music station in the 
area, reducing the diversity in the Gainesville/Ocala ra-dio market and by eliminating one of the two modern alternative rock stations, UF is doing just the opposite of that.
Don McLean would agree. Sean Quinn is a first-year political science student. His 
column appears every Wednesday. Justice for some
Administration not 
exempt from obeying law
We’re proud of our justice system in this country. We 
don’t imprison Nobel Peace Prize winners like Chi-na does, unless you count that whole Martin Luther 
King Jr. situation when we threw the book at him for being black. 
And we spit on the ground near any country that doesn’t 
follow our coveted “innocent until proven guilty” judicial mantra. 
Except if you’re Muslim, brown-skinned or remotely look 
like you might be from any of those –stan countries. No, then you’re a terrorist, and we need to shackle you up. 
The American Civil Liberties Union will certainly be de-
lighted as the Supreme Court agreed Monday to intervene in a case dealing with the issue of falsely labeling someone who 
looks Middle Eastern as a terrorist as the civil rights organi-
zation keeps trying to sue members of the Bush Administra-tion for abusing the law. 
Saying former Attorney General John Ashcroft used a 
“gross abuse” of his authority as the nation’s top attorney by arresting and shackling Muslim-looking assumed terror -
ists in airports and around town, particularly Lavoni Kidd in 2005, the ACLU wants Ashcroft to be held accountable for his woefully incompetent misuse of the law to arrest Americans 
without any probable cause.
But apparently to some people, having brown skin is 
enough probable cause. 
The fact of the matter is the Bush Administration, par -
ticularly Ashcroft, abused the laws intended to protect our 
citizens. 
It’s time to face the fire. The people in charge of falsely 
labeling Middle Easterners as terrorists need to be held ac-countable for using race as probable cause.

Letter to the Editor
A serious need for America
It’s been a long and crazy road to these 
midterm elections with lots of rhetoric and lots 
of ridiculous commercials. However, now it’s time to have a moment of seriousness before we go to the polls in less than two weeks. 
Speaking of seriousness, this is the one 
quality the Tea Party and the GOP notably lacks at the moment. For many reasons, we in this country have gotten ourselves into some serious problems, including dependence on foreign oil, dangerous trade imbalances and an inability to meet our financial obligations such as social security and Medicare. Despite what you hear on TV , these prob-
lems did not become problems in January 2009. We have been moving in this direction for a few decades.
The Tea Party and many GOP candidates 
seem to think “I don’t like taxes” and “I don’t like bailouts” are real campaign platforms — 
they’re not, by the way. Do some research and 
see if you can find a single, reputable econo-mist who thinks the bailout was unnecessary . Do some research and find out taxes have decreased for 95 percent of Americans since Obama took office. A recent New York Times poll showed 90 percent of Americans have no idea their taxes were cut.  
We need people in government who are go-
ing to make tough situations in the face of very tough circumstances. Listening to Republican commercials, you would think the only issue this country is facing is big government. 
This is the same government Obama inher -
ited from Bush. It has an executive, legislative and judicial branch. It is responsible for many tasks and those tasks are funded by taxes. The only thing that has changed is GOP strategists have figured out talking about “small gov-ernment” gets certain voters as excited as a 13-year-old girl at a Justin Bieber concert.So when you go to the polls, and you’re all 
angry about health care, bailouts and taxes, remember all responsible economists agreed health care needed swift and aggressive re-form to avoid a financially unsustainable situ-ation. Remember the bailouts, while painful, were not only the brainchild of Bush, but were 
extraordinarily necessary . Remember your 
taxes and taxes for small businesses have de-creased.  Make an informed choice. Don’t get excited about hollow and absurd campaign slogans. V ote for serious people.

If you’ve done as much study of the Founding Fathers as I 
have, one fact starts to stick out time and again: none was the product of public education. That’s right, the greatest 
men of American history were all schooled either in the rooms of a private institution or by the best teacher in the world: real 
life.
Had they known in a couple centuries the hopes for rep-
resentative government rested on the votes of brainwashed 
drones, educated by the state on the high value of Rooseveltism, laziness and sexual deviancy , would they have proceeded how they did?
In the always witty words of Thomas Jefferson, “Not on the 
life of a poore cooper’s wife.”
Don’t believe me? Just take a look at the curricula forced 
upon schools by the Florida Department of Education. Civics classes don’t require a single mention of Ronald Reagan, Her -
bert Hoover or John Tyler, rated by scholars as the three best presidents in history. Inconveniently for the state, they just hap-pen to be the president who pushed to dismantle the Depart-ment of Education, the president who was solving the Great Depression the market-based way only to have FDR plunge us back into record unemployment and the president who ac-cepted Texas into the union. I wonder why the Department of 
Education passes them over.Instead, requirements include entries 
like “Socialism — discuss benefits and 
shortcomings.” Shortcomings? I’m not sure the people of Soviet Russia would 
have used that weak of a word, although they would probably 
admit that they were “coming up short” on essentials like food 
and televisions.
It’s not just the explicit curriculum; it’s also what they’re 
implicitly teaching us. It’s clear, to intelligent people at least,  having free education  breeds dependence on the government. Every time a cut in Bright Futures is discussed,  students whine in a collective fear of less beer money and (gasp!) a summer job. Contrast that with Constitution signer Nicholas Gilman, who, from age seven, worked on his father’s farm eight months 
a year and had to work in the school’s kitchen to pay for his 
four months of tuition the rest of the year. And although his IQ tested at 165 as an adult, this was only average for the raised-on-work Founding Fathers.
It’s no wonder George W. Bush preferred hiring from 
schools like Patrick Henry College for his administration. Not only are the students learning in a government-free, Christian environment, as the Founding Fathers did, but 85 percent of the student body was homeschooled for K-12. They are hard  
working, moral, honest and won’t be able to tell you one good thing about socialism. It is from schools like these we will see 
another George Washington — not the government-doled Harvard or Yale.
The good news is the 2010 elections are shaping up to put 
Republicans back in charge of the Senate and the House. 
We’ve fallen into dead last in education as a recent study 
showed the majority of eighth graders in this country couldn’t find the United States on a map. 
In even better news, future-Speaker Boehner has hinted at 
plans to overhaul the school system in innovative ways. No more federal scholarships. No more biased accreditation sys-tem. Strings attached to federal block grants will require cuts to local school funding. While Obama is sure to veto it (so much for change), when 2012 rolls around with Republican President 
Haley Barbour, we’ll be on the start of a path to fix education.
And it couldn’t come soon enough. We’re so dishonoring 
the Founding Fathers, I suggest a radical move: exhume all the 
signers of the Declaration of Independence and  the Constitu-tion, attach magnets to their incorrupted bodies, wrap their coffins in wire and re-enter them. The power generated by the spinning in their graves over education will be enough for the country to become energy independent. But that’s another col-umn.

Special Force (OMON) officers are seen at the scene after a bomb blast, with human body parts in front 
of Chechen parliament complex in Grozny, Chechnya, southern Russia on Tuesday. 
INTERNATIONAL
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
GROZNY, Russia — Islamic 
insurgents attacked Chechnya’s 
parliament Tuesday in a brazen suicide raid that left six people dead and 17 wounded, defying Kremlin claims of stability in the volatile southern region.
In a clear challenge to Moscow, 
the raid occurred just as Russia’s interior minister was visiting the provincial capital of Grozny.
The three attackers drove to the 
tightly guarded parliament com-plex and got inside. One militant blew himself up at the doors and another two ran into the building shouting “Allahu akbar!” — “God is great!” in Arabic — as they opened fire on the people inside, said Chechen police spokesman Ramzan Bekkhoyev.
The regional chief prosecutor’s 
office said the remaining two at-tackers also blew themselves up after exchanging fire with police, while other officials said they were killed in a gunbattle. Two police officers and a civilian government employee were killed in the raid and 17 others were wounded, prosecutors said.
Bloodstains, body parts and a 
decapitated corpse were still scat-tered outside the building hours after the attack as police and spe-cial forces backed by armored ve-hicles patrolled the area.
An Associated Press reporter 
at the parliament saw ambulances take away two bodies, along with the severed head of a militant.
Chechnya’s Moscow-backed 
regional president, Ramzan Kadyrov, sought to play down the attack, saying the assailants were killed quickly. 
His office said Russian Prime 
Minister Vladimir Putin and Pres-ident Dmitry Medvedev called him to offer assistance. Medvedev, on a visit to France, was briefed about the attack by Russian secu-rity officials.
In Washington, the U.S. offered 
condolences to the families of the dead and wounded.
“We also express our solidarity with Russia in the struggle against terrorism. We’re concerned about continued violence in Russia’s North Caucasus, which contrib-utes to instability and personal in-security in the region,” said State Department spokesman Mark Toner. “Several independent non-governmental reports confirm that the level of violence has increased in 2010 in several North Caucasus regions, and we’ve been following these events closely.”
Kadyrov and Russia’s Inte-
rior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev attended a parliament session shortly after the raid. Nurgaliyev said the insurgents had tried to get into the main parliamentary chamber.
“As always, they failed. Un-
fortunately, we were not able to avoid loss of life,” Nurgaliyev said. “The situation we saw today is extremely rare. Here, there is stability and security.”
Kadyrov, a former rebel, has 
recruited many ex-militants into his feared security forces. The bullnecked 34-year-old former militia chief also sought to blunt the rebels’ appeal with a massive construction boom in Chechnya and a campaign to impose strict Islamic values.
The ITAR-Tass news agency 
cited Chechnya’s Interior Min-istry branch as saying that the attack had been planned by war -
lord Khusein Gakayev who had broken loose from the main rebel commander, Doku Umarov. It said Gakayev launched the attack to try to raise his profile.
Human rights activists have 
accused security forces and para-military units under Kadyrov’s command of extra-judicial kill-ings, kidnappings and torture of rebel suspects and their relatives.

� THE RESOLUTION PASSED 
UNANIMOUSLY.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Student Senate approved a 
resolution in opposition of block tu-
ition at a meeting Tuesday night.
Block tuition would change UF 
tuition from a per-credit-hour fee 
system to a flat-fee tuition, based off of the cost of 15 credit hours.
According to the resolution, the 
Senate opposes block tuition be-cause there are students who take fewer than 15 credit hours because 
they have other obligations, such as 
work, extracurricular activities or family obligations.
The resolution stated that these 
activities are es-
sential to prepare 
students for life after college, and 
block tuition could mean students 
would have less time for these ac-
tivities. 
The resolution passed unani-
mously, without debate.
Senators also debated amend-
ments to the 800 codes of the Stu-dent Constitution, which outline the rules for allocating Student Government finances.Senators oppose block tuition

ALEXANDRIA, Va.— A north-
ern Virginia man who warned the 
creators of the animated TV show “South Park” that they risked death for mocking the prophet 
Muhammad is scheduled to plead 
guilty to supporting an al-Qaida linked terrorist group, according to court records.
Zachary Chesser of Bris-
tow, Va., a 20-year-old dropout from George Mason University, is scheduled for a plea hearing Wednesday in federal court in Al-
exandria, Va., court records show. 
He is charged with providing ma-terial support to a terrorist group, communicating threats and solic-iting crimes of violence.
According to a court affidavit, 
Chesser tried to join the al-Shabab terror group in Somalia earlier this year and posted online propagan-
da for them. Chesser also alleg-edly took his infant son with him 
to the airport to make his travel appear more innocuous.
Both the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice in Alexandria and Chesser’s attorney, federal public defender 
Michael Nachmanoff, declined 
comment Tuesday.
Before Chesser’s arrest in July 
on the terror charges, he was best known for posting a harshly worded attack on the 
creators of the “South Park” cartoon for their perceived 
mockery of the prophet Muham-mad.
Prosecutors say that Chesser 
tried twice in the last year to travel to Somalia and join al-Shabab as 
a foreign fighter. The most recent 
attempt came July 10.Va. man to admit 
to helping Somali terrorist group

  Students have made their voices heard by staying si-
lent. 
  About 25 members of UF’s Pro-Life Alliance,   their 
mouths covered with red duct tape with the word “life” 
written in black, took a daylong vow of silence Tuesday 
to remember the lives lost through abortion.
  “We give up our voices for the day to symbolize the 
4,000 babies that will be aborted today , who never even 
got a chance to be heard,” said Brianne Umhoefer, vice president of the UF Pro-Life Alliance.  
  The protest is part of the seventh annual Day of Silent 
Solidarity, a national event organized by Stand True Min-istries in Ohio that asks pro-life supporters to take a vow of silence for the day . 
  The members who chose to remain silent did so for 
the entire day , sporting the red duct tape to class. They 
allowed themselves to speak only when “vi-tally necessary,” Umhoefer said.
  “It’s kind of ironic when you really think 
about it,” said Mary Catherine Damon, UF 
Pro-Life Alliance secretary. “We’re completely silent, but we get more attention doing this than we would if we were yelling and screaming.”
  Pro-Life Alliance President Sharon Parker said the 
event draws mixed reactions. She said last year some stu-dents joined in even though they were not afﬁ  liated with the group. But the group also gets negative reactions.
    “Each year we get a few really aggressive people that 
just want to argue,” she said. “They just get really an-gry.”
  Parker said most people who disagree with the group 
are pretty respectful, though. 
  Senior linguistics major Cary Marcous said she’s been 
offended by other pro-life protests, but she ﬁ  nds the Day of Silent Solidarity a nice alternative to more abrasive demonstrations.
  “If they can get their point across in a way that is this 
peaceful, then more power to them,” she said. WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 9

Libero Erin Fleming and Florida will take on Tennessee just three days after beating Georgia on Sunday, The Gators beat the Vols in their first meeting on Sept. 19.
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
 
Many things have changed 
since Mary Wise became Florida’s 
coach in 1991.
While the basic objectives of 
volleyball have remained the same, how the team trains for a season has become vastly different.
“When we first got here we 
were doing a watered-down ver -
sion of what football was doing, and it wasn’t sport specific,” Wise said. “Players would come in, do it and get out. Now it’s devised for each individual athlete by posi-tion.”
The strength and condition-
ing program will come into play tonight as the No. 1 Gators (16-1, 9-0 Southeastern Conference) take on the No. 21 Volunteers (15-4, 7-3 SEC) in the O’Connell Center at 8 — just three days after defeating Georgia on Sunday. The match will be nationally televised on ESPNU.
It’s not the ideal length of time 
the team would like to prepare for its second meeting with Tennessee (UF won 3-1 (28-26, 25-23, 19-25, 25-17) on Sept. 19). But, physically, the Gators are ready.
“Strength training is a part of 
athletics — for injury prevention, for bettering performance,” Wise 
said. “We’ve been very fortunate 
in terms of our health and it’s all 
related to the job [Matt DeLancey] does.”
DeLancey, who is in his seventh 
season as the strength and condi-
tioning coordinator for the Gators, 
designs a specific conditioning program for each player. Each of the players do single-leg jumps 
ACL prevention, arm strength and 
rotator cuff prevention to help pre-
vent injury and strengthen those areas.
“Matt DeLancey is the most 
high energy person I’ve ever met in 
my life,” libero Erin Fleming said. 
“He’s really enthusiastic about the program; he’s tough and never 
gives us a break.
“We had a game Friday and 
Sunday and now a quick turn-
around Wednesday against a re-ally good Tennessee team. During 
the summer, he prepared us for 
this kind of quick turnaround so Gators ready to face Vols after short turnaround

Look at Florida’s “Keys to Suc-
cess” chart, and you will only see one assignment for the of-
fense: succeed in the red zone.
Of course, the chart as a whole 
is an oversimplified way to explain wins and losses. It only consists of four keys.
But since Urban Meyer brought his 
super spread option to Gainesville in 2005, the amount of points Florida’s offense posted has directly  correlated with the group’s red-zone success. In the Age of Urban, the offense’s peak seasons were 2007 and 2008, when the Gators averaged 43.1 points per game and scored on 89 percent of red-zone possessions. 
But in Meyer’s other four seasons, 
Florida has scored on just 75 percent of trips inside the opponents’ 20-yard line, making this year’s red-zone ef-ficiency rate (73 percent) troubling not because of how low it is but because of how little it 
tells fans about 
the offense. 
Why are the 
Gators manag-ing only 27.6 points per game, the low-
est since 2002?
Yes, Florida’s red-zone offense 
has been bad. But, by comparison, the team’s offense outside the op-ponent’s 20-yard line has been much worse.
This season’s offense is scoring 
about the same amount of points (18 per game) inside the red zone as Tim Tebow and Friends did last year. But the 2009 unit averaged 36 total Big plays bigger than red zone

After entering last season with serious 
questions about the point guard position, 
coach Billy Donovan believes he has four vi-
able answers to start the new year. 
With Erving Walker returning for his ju-
nior year, Chandler Parsons and Kenny Boyn-
ton developing their point guard skills and 
Scottie Wilbekin making the jump from high school, the Gators have plenty of options at the one spot.
“We feel like, outside of Erving, we have 
some other options we can use if Erving is 
maybe getting taken out of the game, or we 
need to try to free him up to shoot the ball a little bit more,” Donovan said. 
Last season Walker started 33 of the team’s 
34 games, averaging a team-high 4.9 assists per game and establishing a 2-1 assist-to-turnover ratio. 
But, as the season wore on, teams started 
to put more pressure on Walker in the back-
court. This forced him to pass over defend-ers, which proved to be a difficult task for the 
Southeastern Conference’s shortest player (5-foot-8). 
In response, the Gators would usually call 
on 6-foot-10 forward Chandler Parsons to run the point. 
Parsons proved to be an effective option, 
averaging 2.6 assists per game and posting a 
1.3-1 assist to turnover ratio for the season. 
Throughout the offsea-
son Parsons has worked on making those areas of his 
game even stronger in an 
attempt to become a more 
complete player. 
“I want to be able to do 
everything,” Parsons said. “I want to be able to pass, shoot, score inside, score outside, de-fend, play the four if I have to, play the point if I have to. So this summer and last year I just tried to become the most versatile player 
I could.”
Parsons has displayed this versatility in UF optimistic about PG depth

UF guard Erving Walker played a team-high 32.9 minutes per game last season. The Gators want to 
lighten Walker’s workload this year.
� HE MADE THE COMMENTS AFTER KENTUCKY’S 
WIN AGAINST SOUTH CAROLINA ON SATURDAY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
LEXINGTON, Ky. — Kentucky wide receiver Randall Cobb 
apologized Tuesday for using Twitter to lash out at fans follow-
ing an upset of South Carolina last weekend. 
Cobb sent out a series of tweets following the game in which 
he chastised fans for coming late, leaving early and being more 
concerned about the school’s basketball team. 
He said it took him “two or three minutes” after sending 
the tweets to realize he had spoken irresponsibly. He almost 
immediately removed the messages. 
Cobb, who scored the game-winning touchdown with just 
over a minute to go, says “99.9 percent” of the fans are great and that he made a mistake. “I just took a small chunk and made it something big,” Cobb 
said. “I can’t do that. I made a mistake. I’m a man, I admit my mistake, and I want to come out and let everybody know that 
I’m sorry. I hope (the fans) can forgive me.” 
The junior wide receiver has earned a reputation as one 
of college football’s most versatile players. 
Through seven games this season, he has five receiving touchdowns, three rushing 
touchdowns, three as a passer and one punt 
return touchdown. His 24-yard touchdown 
catch with just over a minute left against South Carolina gave Kentucky its lead. 
His tweets after the game said: “To all the 
fans: loved seein Yall come late, love hear -
ing Yall tell us we suck during the game, 
love that we have to play against our own fans too! Love that we can’t pack the house when we play the 10 team in the na-tion. It means that much more to me. I love my team! Brother -hood they got my back n I got they back. The rest of Yall can get ready for bball season! Don’t say u support n do all those things! Yeah I’m level 9 (upset)... so deal w it! Not blaming all but Yall know who I’m talking abt- Yall know I love bbn but something needed to be said.” 
Head coach Joker Phillips defended Cobb, saying that a 
college junior doesn’t always know how to take criticism in stride.
 “Me, I’m 47 and I’m just now figuring out to tune out all the 
negative things that come at me,” Phillips said. 
Wide receiver La’Rod King, who scored two touchdowns 
Saturday, sent a tweet on Monday night which said: “Welp looks like no more twitter for us.” He said Tuesday that was his decision and that the situation had been blown out of propor -
tion. 
“All that stuff is, that’s our personal life, but people have 
their opinion and it got out,” King said. “As an athlete, we got to realize we’re held to a higher standard.” Cobb apologizes for criticizing fans via Twitter
Gators hope Wilbekin can 
contribute right away
the early stages of practice, spend-
ing time at point guard  in addition to his normal duties as a forward. 
Even if Donovan opts to use Par -
sons only in the frontcourt, the se-nior expects to show his full range of abilities. 
“In our offense if I get the re-
bound I’m gonna go with it, I’m gonna push the ball,” Parsons said. “If I end up having the ball up there during our half-court set, I can run it comfortably.” 
Another player trying his hand 
in the point guard role is sophomore Kenny Boynton, who led the Gators in scoring while starting in 33 games last season primarily as a shooting 
guard. 
Boynton has spent a large por -
tion of the first few practices play-
ing point guard across from Walker 
in Florida’s intrasquad scrimmages, 
and has found the adjustment to be simpler than he anticipated.  
“So far it’s been a lot easier than I thought, I feel very comfortable,” Boynton said. “I think I’ve been making good decisions at the point guard position.”
A fourth option the Gators have 
is freshman Scottie Wilbekin, whose toughness and stamina have im-pressed Donovan so far.
Donovan believes Wilbekin will 
be able to produce off the bench in 
his rookie season despite joining the 
Gators after only three years of high school at Gainesville The Rock.
“I really believe right now, after 
two practices, just physically and 
conditioning-wise that he is going 
to be able to contribute to our team,” Donovan said. “How many minutes and how much I’m not sure, but I do 
think that he’s going to be a positive 
piece for our team going forward.”HOOPS , from page 14
we’re not physically tired.”
Fleming will be busy against the 
Volunteers, which lead the SEC in hit-
ting percentage.
The Gators will once again count 
on middle blockers Lauren Bledsoe and Cassandra Anderson to combat those two areas of the game.
In Knoxville, Tenn., Bledsoe record-
ed eight blocks as Anderson pitched in with five and a .556 hitting percent-age.
Both anchor a Florida team that

“Tennessee always plays its best 
volleyball in the second half of the SEC season and they have two of the pre-mier offensive players in the league,” Wise said. “They’ve always played us well in the O’Connell Center.”In the first meeting with Tennessee, 
the Gators held Nikki Fowler — third in the SEC in kills — to just eight kills on .097 hitting.
Setter Kelly Murphy will also play a 
large role in tonight’s match. Murphy, who was named the SEC Offensive 
Player of the Week for her performances last weekend, notched a triple-double with 19 kills, 25 assists, 14 digs and four blocks against Tennessee in 
September.
That performance earned her play-
er of the week honors.
“We have a great opportunity for 
our program and the sport of women’s volleyball to play on a national stage with ESPNU,” Wise said. “It’s not something you can say no to.”UF leads conference in blocks

Big plays have made the biggest differ -
ence between the two groups. Florida aver -
aged almost 18 points outside the red zone 
last year while this season’s group is scoring less than 10 per game, the worst rate since Meyer became coach.
Translation: the Gators aren’t explosive.Jeff Demps’ leg injury and Chris Rainey’s 
suspension have hampered the running game. Through seven games last season, the duo had each busted a pair of long touch-down runs. This season, Demps has scored on two big runs while Rainey has been side-lined for buckwild texting. 
But the difference in long runs negli-
gible. And, with scores coming from three interception returns and one kickoff return, Florida’s defense and special teams are pitching in more than they did last year.
This really leaves only one scapegoat: 
the dump-n-run passing game. John Brant-ley has only thrown one touchdown from beyond the 20 — in the season opener on a fourth-quarter Hail Mary to Rainey in dou-ble coverage. The play was so Les-Miles lucky that 
Meyer looked on with disgust as his team celebrated the score. But at least they could celebrate then.
Through seven games last season, Tebow 
awkwardly windmilled the ball for seven touchdowns longer than 20 yards. 
But if Brantley is the culprit, he isn’t per -
forming the unintentional heist solo. Sure, Florida’s passing offense is the SEC’s fifth worst (or eighth best, depending on your outlook). But of Tebow’s seven long-ball, big-nuts touchdowns, only two were direct-ed at receivers on this year’s team. 
Both of those went to Deonte Thompson. 
And would you blame Brantley if he forgot to look in Thompson’s direction for the rest of the season?
You can’t defend Florida’s red-zone 
problems. But that’s not the only area of concern. The Gators have struggled inside the 20 before and still scored in bunches.
The key for the Gators is to start finding 
the end zone from far away, particularly with the ball coming off Brantley’s right arm, because Florida has not outscored op-ponents enough this season.
And that’s the greatest “Key to Suc-
cess.” TYLER , from page 14

Five days after decommitting from 
Florida, A.C. Leonard made his college de-
cision late Monday.
And for the third time in less than a 
year, the four-star Jacksonville University 
Christian School tight end is a Gator.
But this time the nation’s fourth-rated 
tight end, according to Rivals.com, said he’s sticking with his choice.
“Lately people have been coming into 
my life for the wrong reasons,” Leonard 
told Scout.com. “They have been giving 
me bad advice, but now I have had time to 
sit down and think things through. I am a Gator and 
I am shutting the whole 
process down.”
Leonard decommitted 
from Florida last week in 
the wake of UF’s loss to LSU on Oct. 9 — 
the team’s second in a row. 
The tight end attended the game and 
reportedly left The Swamp disappointed 
with the Gators’ offense, saying the 33-29 
loss was difficult to watch.
It wasn’t the first time Leonard backed 
off his oral commitment to the Gators, 
though. 
After initially deciding on UF last No-
vember, Leonard decommitted follow-ing Urban Meyer’s decision to step down as head coach, only to recommit shortly thereafter.
When Leonard reopened the recruiting 
process last week, he was also consider -
ing offers from Nebraska, Alabama and Miami. The tight end already took official visits to Nebraska on Sept. 24 and to Ala-bama on Oct. 1, and University Christian School coach Heath Nivens said last week that Leonard planned to take his remain-ing three official visits, including one to Miami.
But with the four-star prospect closing 
the recruiting process and planning to en-roll at UF in January, it is doubtful Leon-ard will take the remaining visits.
While Leonard will probably be don-
ning a Florida jersey when spring practice 
begins, it is uncertain if he will suit up 
again this season for University Christian School.
Reports surfaced Tuesday afternoon 
that Leonard had been ruled ineligible 
for the remainder of his senior season by 
the FHSAA due to an on-field incident that took place when University Christian played Jacksonville Episcopal High on Fri-
day.
However, calls to Nivens and the FH-
SAA seeking confirmation were not re-
turned Tuesday.
Players unhappy?: According to a re-
port on the website MrSEC.com, Ellen-wood (Ga.) Cedar Grove High athlete Vin-cent Dallas, who took his official visit to Florida for the LSU game, asked current 
players on the UF roster if they were hap-
py with their decisions to become Gators. 
Dallas, who committed to Tennessee on 
Friday, reportedly said some of the players weren’t happy and didn’t “think Florida is 
the right place for them.” The three-star 
athlete refuted the report on his Facebook page and said he wouldn’t be giving any interviews until January.
“To the Florida people that was not a 
true statement about Florida,” Dallas post-ed on his Facebook. “I really really didn’t like how the reporter did me today.”
Oral commitments are non-binding until a 
national letter of intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 2.16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2010
