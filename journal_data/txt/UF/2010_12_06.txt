SPORTS 13Minn. teens accused of stealing at least 17 calves to start their own dairy farm
ST. CLOUD, Minn. — Two teenage boys 
from central Minnesota are accused of steal-
ing at least 17 calves to start their own dairy farm.
Authorities this week arrested a 19-year-
old from Rothsay and a 16-year-old from Barnesville.
Stearns County Sheriff John Sanner says 
deputies received a tip that led them to 17 calves and eventually the teens. 
The calves are believed to have been sto-len from three counties: Douglas, Stearns and Todd.
Investigators say the teens told them they 
wanted to start their own dairy farm. They say the teens planned to keep the heifers and sell the bulls, splitting the profits.
The calves have been returned to their 
owners. The case is being forwarded to prosecutors for possible theft and burglary charges.

Sunday outside 
the Oaks Mall, UF Ph.D. candidate Leylah Drusbosky holds Turbo, a nine-week-old German shepard, while the dog plays with Lily, a six-month-old red nose pitbull whom she is currently fostering. As part of the ninth an -
nual Home for the Holidays Adoption Festival, animal res -
cue shelters around Gainesville came together to find per -
manent homes for cats and dogs who were otherwise un -
wanted, neglected or homeless. Turbo and other pets were given a chance at finding a loving home and bringing joy to a family for the holidays.
n THE ST. FRANCIS HOUSE 
TAKES IN MORE PEOPLE WHEN IT IS COLDER THAN 45 DEGREES.

When she was manager of a Palatka 
Huddle House, she would give coffee to 
homeless men who stopped by the res-
taurant. Now Kim Justice, 50, has been 
homeless for about a year.
Cold on Saturday morning, she said 
she was hoping a friend would take her 
out for coffee. She sees it as full-circle 
fate. She helped others then, and others 
help her now.
The St. Francis House, a Gainesville 
soup kitchen and shelter, provides help 
for Justice and the city’s homeless pop-
ulation — specifically shelter from the 
cold.Forty-five degrees is the magic num-
ber. If the temperature dips below that, 
the shelter opens its doors to up to 65 people and gives them a cot to sleep 
on. 
If the shelter is full, the Alachua 
County Housing Authority pays for the 
homeless to stay in motels, like Sun-shine Inn and Rush Lake, until it warms 
up. As of Friday, nine people had cho-
sen that option.
The temperature dropped to 28 de-
grees on Thursday and Friday night. 
It was the kind of cold that, if you’re 
dressed like Justice, wearing a sweater, 
capri jeans and flip-flops, you shiver so 
hard it starts to hurt. 
Tonight and Tuesday night are pre-
dicted to have the same freezing tem-peratures. 
But it was only 47 degrees at 7 p.m. 
Justice still had an hour to wait until Homeless seek 
shelter from cold

As you chugged through the fall 
semester, you’ve likely mastered 
the balancing act between classes, 
exams, work, internships, football season and what remains of your social life. Now finals are here, and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed with the pressure, cramming and lack of sleep, especially with break right around the corner. These tips will help you study for hours while 
keeping that volatile mood at bay.
1. Pay attention to your envi-
ronment
Turn off the computer, tele-
vision, iPhone and anything in 
between, even if it’s for just 15 minutes.  “In this day and age of 
so much electronic contact, we’re 
bombarding ourselves with stim-ulation,” said Kim Kazimour, a Gainesville psychologist special-izing in mental health counseling and behavior management.
Decrease the amount of elec-
tronic stimulation in your environment 
and stimulate the 
senses instead. 
Make a playlist of soft, calming 
music. Take deep, slow breaths.  Try lighting a candle.  
Think a candle’s scent is too 
strong for your taste? Try other aro-matherapies like lotions and soaps, which can be just as effective.Combat stress as 
finals approach

Florida Senate President 
and UF lecturer Mike Harido-
polos admitted Friday that he made some ethical lapses over financial disclosures related to his employment at UF. 
On Friday, the Florida Com-
mission on Ethics unanimously approved a settlement for the senator over the violations. 
Haridopolos did not attend 
the Friday commission meet-ing but said he recognized that he violated the Florida Consti-tution by not fully disclosing his financial income for five 
years from 2004 to 2008. 
The commission is legally 
r e s t r i c t e d 
from penal-
izing legis-
lators, and 
any punish-
ment will be decided by the Senate 
Rules Com-
mittee, which is led by Sen. 
John Thrasher, chairman of the Florida Republican Party. 
“This is an embarrassing thing for me,” Haridopolos said in an interview with Sun-shine State News. “I’m not excited about it. I’m very dis-appointed in myself and my behavior, and that’s why we corrected these immediately as soon as we found out about them.”
The errors made include 
failure to fully disclose where he taught classes, his part-time earnings from the university from 2005 to 2006, real estate investments and information regarding the clientele for his business, MJH consulting. 
Haridopolos has been teach-
ing classes at UF on govern-ment and politics since 2008.Sen. admits ethics violations

City celebrates annual Christmas tree lighting
On Saturday night, Santa 
Claus spoke to a crowd of about 
500 with a special message to 
kids about pride, courage and 
honor at the annual Holiday Tree Lighting Ceremony spon-
sored by the city.
Shouts of, “I want to sit on 
Santa’s lap,” filled the rooms 
at the Thomas Center as eager kids lined up to see Santa.
“The event is a family affair 
for everyone to get ready for the holiday season,” said David Ballard, event coordinator for the Department of Parks, Rec-
reation and Cultural Affairs for 
the city.
Ballard, dressed as Ebenezer 
Scrooge, walked around greet-ing everyone with a raspy voice. 
City Commissioner Jeanna 
Mastrodicasa led a countdown 
before she pressed a button to 
light the tree.
Everyone clapped and cel-
ebrated. Shouts filled the room. 
“This event grows every 
year, and it brings the commu-
nity together,” Mastrodicasa said.
After the lighting, kids fol-
lowed Santa to his red chair for pictures and whispered in his ear to tell him what gifts they wanted for the holidays.
“It’s the sparkle of joy in the 
kids’ eyes, why I grew my own beard and dress up as Santa Claus,” said Dennis Pollard, the man behind the beard.

Andrew Tamayo steps into the 
cage.
He can smell the cleaning solu-
tion used on the mats, but he clears 
his mind of that and all other dis-
tractions. He has to stay focused. 
He’s studied karate since he was 4. He’s competed in plenty of fights. 
But never like this. He’s standing in a fighting cage 
at the WCW World Cage Wars event in Ocala. It’s his first amateur mixed martial arts competition. In the next three rounds, someone is 
going down. 
Tamayo isn’t going into this 
fight blind. As a member of the F2 
Darkside Fight Team in Gainesville, he has spent hours preparing for this moment. The team is a group of about 20 men who compete in amateur and pro matches against fighters across the nation, and, 
sometimes, across the world. It’s 
the oldest fight team in Florida, and as a member, Tamayo has been pushed by his teammates to fight harder, stronger, better. 
But this time, he isn’t sparring 
with his team. He faces a true op-ponent. It’s time to put his skills to the test. 
As he taps gloves with his op-
ponent, he forgets about the scanti-ly clad girls standing cage-side. He doesn’t notice the Vaseline on his face, rubbed onto his skin to lessen possible bleeding. His whole world revolves around this cage and the other fighter standing inside it. 
His opponent throws a punch, 
but Tamayo barely feels it through the haze of adrenaline. He answers with a high-kick that misses, fol-lowed by two kicks to the body and one to the head. 
He grabs the fighter around 
the chest and shoves him toward a corner. 
Covered in sweat, they fight. 
Tamayo ends up in a headlock but doesn’t stop moving, getting his opponent on the ground. He holds tight to keep him in place. But there’s still more than a minute left in this three-minute round — plen-ty of time to lose the upper hand. 
With his friends and teammates 
yelling from the sidelines, Tamayo 
presses his advantage. 
Two rounds later, he wins.
Tamayo, 19, has been practicing 
mixed martial arts for about a year. He started the sport as soon as he became eligible at 18. He joined the F2 Darkside Fight Team in Septem-ber. 
He is taking courses at Santa Fe College and plans to attend nurs-ing school. After he graduates, he wants to pursue careers in nursing and MMA.
“I’ve always looked up to cage 
fighters,” he said. “I think they have a lot of guts to do what they do, and I just want to be one of the better ones.”
For now, Tamayo is focusing 
on honing his skills as an amateur competitor with F2 Darkside. 
The team was started in 1998 
by Mike Lee and evolved over the 
years into F2 Darkside. Members 
practiced in several places around town before finally settling at F2 Arena and Darkside Athletics this May, said gym co-owner Becky Hodge. 
She owns the gym with her hus-
band, Ryan Hodge, who joined the team in 1999 while studying engi-
neering at UF. 
A seasoned competitor, Hodge 
competed in an MMA fight over -
seas in Cypress in October. Dur -
ing the first round of his fight, he 
knocked out his opponent, who fell awkwardly on his ankle and painfully twisted his foot.
For Hodge, a fight is over af-
ter a winner is declared, and he is friendly toward other pros. He waited for paramedics, holding the man down to keep him from doing more damage to his foot when he regained consciousness. 
Hands protected by boxing gloves, Tamayo spars with a team-mate in the warehouse that is home to F2 Arena and Darkside Athletics. 
They practice on an expanse 
of mats, and beyond them is a 20-foot cage they are constructing for practices. A nearby wall is punctu-ated with holes made during spar -
ring sessions that got too intense, a reminder that MMA is a sport of heavy punches, high kicks and hard falls — and no one goes easy on a teammate when they spar. 
Ryan Hodge stands nearby the 
practice, coaching Tamayo who is fresh off his first amateur win. 
“Don’t let me down. Hit him,” 
Hodge says. 
Tamayo launches a punch and 
connects.
“There you go,” Hodge says. 
“Do it again.”
Backed close to the wall, Tamayo 
takes a few hits before throwing a punch to get his partner off him.“Fight back.”As a coach, Hodge helps ama-
teur and pro team members pre-pare for upcoming matches and gives them pointers on improving 
technique. But he doesn’t try to 
make Tamayo or anyone else fight a certain way. Each man is free to play to his strengths. 
Tamayo has established close 
relationships with his fellow fight-ers. 
“These guys want to work with 
you and want to make you better. 
You might see them in a fight and 
they’re cocky — and that’s part of it — but outside (the fights) all of them are really humble,” he said.
They practice at the Darkside 
gym Monday through Thurs-day, often traveling on Fridays to practice at other gyms with differ -
ent fighters. Practices are “sink or 
swim,” Becky Hodge said. New 
fighters roll with the pro guys and just go for it. 
For Kevin “Kage” Pearson, am-
ateur fighting isn’t enough. 
Pearson, 23, turned pro in Oc-
tober after more than 30 amateur competitions. As a pro fighter, he can’t participate in amateur match-
es but is now eligible to be paid for 
fights and to receive sponsorships. He is already sponsored by Fresco Neighborhood Italian and Maui Teriyaki, which provide Pearson free meals in return for the public-ity that the sponsorships bring. He practices constantly, building 
muscle and refining techniques. A boxer since he was 9, Pearson is no stranger to a punch. His leopard-print hairstyle may turn heads, but 
it’s his lethal strength and determi-
nation that he’s building a reputa-tion on. 
When he’s not training, he 
works several part-time jobs, in-cluding one as a firefighter in High Springs and one as a bouncer at the Vault NightClub in Gainesville. While these jobs help pay the bills, 
his real commitment is to MMA.
He wants to work as a firefight-
er while pursuing a side career as a 
pro fighter. He’s proud to be a com -
petitor in a sport that some people shy away from, and training keeps him in shape for his MMA career and for his job as a firefighter.
But turning pro wasn’t a smooth 
transition. In the days before his first competition, he was emotion-al at practice and even yelled at a teammate. He faced the nerves, however, knowing that when he stepped into the cage to compete he had to be focused. 
Before the first round of his 
pro career started in Panama City, 
Pearson prayed. 
It was a quick prayer, asking 
that he and his opponent fight well 
and stay safe. 
Then the fight started.Rushing his opponent, he 
throws a few punches to his stom-ach and shoves him against the side of the cage. Clasping his arms un-
der the fighter’s legs, Pearson flips 
him to the ground with a thud. 
The announcer’s voice rings 
across the cage, but he stays fo-cused, landing punches against the fighter’s sweat-matted head even though his opponent has trapped his other arm. 
The only thing he hears besides 
the smack of his punches is the ad-vice of his coaches, who are stand-ing nearby.
His opponent gets the best of 
him for a second, rolling him over so Pearson’s back is to the floor. Pearson grapples, pulling him closer to deaden his punches.
Grabbing the fighter’s arm, he 
twists it back like a cop trying to control a disorderly criminal. He twists it all the way up to his head, flipping himself back on top. 
In less than 90 seconds, the 
match is over. Pearson wins, re-turning to his cheering teammates on F2 Darkside and ready to train again as soon as they get home.
With one pro fight under his 
belt, he has to start training for his next match in December.
For cage fighters, sport is physical and emotional

Two UF alumni could be making their big-
screen debut during the Super Bowl in Febru-
ary.
Theater graduates Nick Greene and Ryan 
George have entered a commercial in a contest to win a spot in the Super Bowl lineup of ad-vertisements for Doritos.Their 30-second commercial is called “Dor -
ito Pong” and mimics the drinking game beer 
pong. Instead of using beer and pingpong 
balls, the players use Doritos and an egg in the game, George said. 
They were trying to think of what people 
did on football game days and quickly real-ized that beer pong is a popular game they could easily relate to Doritos, he said.
According to Crash the Super Bowl’s web-
site, the award for first place is $1 million, 
second place is $600,000 and third place is 
$400,000. The finalist with the highest-scoring advertisement gets a contract to help create Doritos commercials in the future. 
Finalists for the Super Bowl competition 
will be announced Jan. 3. 
George and Greene have been creating vid-
eos and posting them to YouTube since they 
graduated in May . They started making parodies because it was easy and fun for them to come up with ideas. 
 “There are so many things out there to 
make fun of, it would be almost wrong not 
to,” George said. 
The problem of a limited budget forced the 
duo to be creative with their idea for the Super Bowl commercial. George said it had to be es-
pecially clever because it had to be simple.
“It really pushed us to be creative with our 
idea and not lean on flashy stuff to win our au-dience over,” he said.
They rented a high-quality camera for the 
Super Bowl video because they felt it would improve their chances. Greene, 23, said they worked very hard on the editing, filming and sound for their submission. 
“Thinking about whether or not we’ll win 
will make you go crazy ,” he said. “Either way , I’m still proud of our work and knowing that we made our friends laugh.”UF grads hope ‘Dorito Pong’ video will be Super Bowl ad“I’ve always looked up to

have a lot of guts to do 
what they do, and I just

StudentLife4, ALLIGATOR n MONDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2010
she’d be let into a lobby where stacks of 
blankets and a Christmas tree awaited her. She said she’s always been able to get into the St. Francis House during cold weather.
“It’s well taken care of on cold nights,” 
she said.
The van she usually sleeps in is a Hilton 
compared to her previous home of a tent in the woods. But Friday night, it was too cold for her to wait for her bed on wheels.
Her friend, who owns the van, couldn’t 
leave work until 11 p.m., so she checked in to the shelter.
Justice secured her cot by waiting in line 
two hours before the shelter’s sign-in time.
But before she slept in vans and on cots, 
she was the manager of a Huddle House, a Southern restaurant chain that boasts its country fried steak and never stops serving breakfast.
She remembers giving free coffee and 
dinners to two homeless men who would often stop in just for a warm place to sit. 
She said drunk customers always ordered 
more than they could eat, and she gave those meals to the homeless men, too.
Helping them warmed her heart, like the 
coffee she served.
But she never thought she’d end up in the 
same place. 
Justice said the shelter offers more than 
just a warm bed — it gives peace of mind. The shelter provides blankets, pillows, toi-letries, a shower and breakfast.
“We get to relax,” she said.Justice said without shelters like the St. 
Francis House, the streets would be cold and frightening for her.
“People will steal from you left and 
right.”But at the shelter, she feels safe. She brought snacks for the wait: chocolate 
glazed doughnuts given to her by the Salva-tion Army and an oversized coffee mug full of water.
“I wish I had some coffee,” she said as 
the temperature slowly descended with the sun.
Not everyone opted for sleeping at the 
shelter, even when newspapers warned it could be less than 30 degrees that night.
Leon Blunt said he was content with 
sleeping in his tent with his six blankets, two electric blankets and sleeping bag.
“When it comes down to a man like some-
one in my position, I’d rather see someone else take that spot [in the shelter],” he said. “I’ll just wait here patiently because I know the Lord will take care of me.”
However, it’s not entirely because of his 
generosity that he wants to let someone take his place. Nor is it completely because of his criminal record, although the St. Francis House requires every person to get clearance from police before they can sleep there.
He said it’s the smell. He said that some 
of the men don’t bathe for months, and the sweaty odor only gets worse as the building heats up.
Justice said she’s never noticed the smell 
and said the St. Francis House is clean. 
But men and women sleep in different 
rooms. She sleeps in the lobby, and men sleep in the dining room.
Blunt waited outside the Holy Trinity 
Episcopal Church on Friday night, breath-ing in the cold air and waiting with about a dozen men for  dinner provided by the church.
A born-again Christian, Blunt is looking 
for work in plumbing, tree management, roofing — anything he can find.But Blunt said not many places are hir -
ing, and his criminal record often disquali-fies him. He was released from prison on Sept. 24 after spending two years there for minor offenses, including buying and sell-ing stolen property.
He said the many mistakes he made 
when he was younger have followed him from prison to the job market.
“That past follows you the rest of your 
life,” he said.
But as far as the cold goes, he said he’s all 
right. He has his tent, his spot, and he knows which organizations hand out food on any given day.
He said families never have to sleep on 
the streets on a cold night. Shelters and relief organizations make sure families and chil-dren have a roof over their heads.
“They make an extreme effort for that,” 
he said.
But he chose to stay outdoors.He said he spends a lot of his time read-
ing at the downtown library. But when it gets dark, he goes to his tent and the layers of warmth. Then, he gets up at 5:30 a.m. and looks for work.
“Sometimes I get work, sometimes I 
don’t,” he said.
Day after day, he goes through the same 
routine. His concerns about the weather are thrown to the wind. He said he trusts God to take care of him and to keep him warm.
“The days that I don’t see sunshine, it’s 
not bad,” he said, “because the storm doesn’t last always.” Low temperatures are expected to be below freezing all week

n THE “STARCRAFT II” 
TEAM IS UNDEFEATED.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
While the Gators may not 
have performed very well on 
the football field, the Gators in space have been unstoppable.
UF’s collegiate-league “Star -
Craft II“ team, a real-time strate-
gy game set in space and played 
online, has been destroying competition since late October, and after six matchups, UF is undefeated.
“It’s actually been pretty 
easy ,” said Fangzhou Hou, a computer engineering junior and one of the team’s star play-
ers. “I have a lot of confidence in 
our team, and hopefully we can win it all.”
The team formed a few 
months before their first match, brought together and coordinat-ed by sophomore Tyler Reed. 
Reed said he learned about 
the league through game fo-
rums online and quickly set 
about recruiting players through friends, forums and even pick-ing talented players in local area network centers.
“It’s been better than I ex-
pected by far,” said Reed, who’s proud of the team’s success.
The Gators have already 
defeated their rivals at Florida State University , along with one of the league’s best teams, Uni-
versity of Waterloo.
“Our first game was when 
we made noise for ourselves,” 
said biochemistry senior Pavel Alekseyev , who recently took down a pro-level player from the University of Central Florida in a one-on-one match. “We’re the only undefeated team in 
our division … there’s really no 
modest way around it.”
The team plays  11 games be-
fore the top four teams from each division are sent to the playoffs. 
Their next match against the Uni-versity of Regina is coming up on 
Saturday , but the players aren’t too worried about the competi-tion.
“The whole team’s been do-
ing really well,” Alekseyev said. “It’d be pretty hard to not get top four at this point.”
The team is still open to play-
ers who want to get in on the 
action. Interested students can 
e-mail Reed at reedt@ufl.edu.
“Even if you’re not a serious 
player, it’s a good resource,” Reed said. “We’re always down to help out.”Student group makes 'wings of liberty' fly over UF

Dirty politics
In an early showing of 
dirty , rotten things to come during the next handful of 
years, Sen.-elect Marco Rubio and Gov .-elect Rick Scott were quick to criticize President Ba-rack Obama for extending the ban on oil drilling in federal waters off Florida’s coast. 
Calling it a job-killer, 
many prominent Florida Re-publicans failed to recognize what the massive explosion of Deepwater Horizon did to jobs. By failing to recognize the oil rig’s disastrous conse-quences to Florida tourism, 
ecology and jobs across the 
Gulf Coast, Scott, Rubio and Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos leave little room for debate. These lawmakers value little more than money-hungry, oil-coated special in-terests. 
And when money talks 
this loud, why would they?But the Editorial Board is, 
perhaps, more disappointed with their simultaneous re-fusal to acknowledge what an enormous opportunity this presents to expand renewable energy , which would provide a more sustainable Florida while also creating thousands of jobs in developing and op-erating the infrastructure. 
Such short-sighted and 
dirty politics is not what Flori-da nor any state needs.
The Editorial Board was 
pleasantly surprised, howev-er, to hear Republican Attor -
ney General-elect Pam Bondi outright oppose any “near-shore drilling,” saying we need to “protect our state.”
Clearly setting an example 
that shows environmental protection is not a partisan is-sue. We hope our future Flori-da leaders will eventually fol-low Bondi’s example.Truth and
 treason
WikiLeaks bans wrong
If only BP could have pulled the same public relations re-sponse the federal government is rolling out now. 
In response to growing international criticism of 
WikiLeaks, including some calling for Secretary of State Hil-
lary Clinton’s resignation, which amounts to the worldly 
equivalent of a 250,000-page “Mean Girls” burn book that 
bashed the entire world, the Obama administration is order -
ing all federal employees to not view the secret notes passed 
around the globe. 
If only BP could have tried to avoid its international criti-
cism by just pretending nothing happened. Imagine how many pelicans could have been saved! 
While we agree the documents released are classified in-
formation, the Editorial Board does not agree with the fed-eral government’s sloppy response to cleaning up the mess from all the gossiping this country has done. And, more im-portantly, we don’t agree with the federal government man-
dating an enormous censor on its employees after the United 
States was rightfully caught in an international scandal that 
sounds more like a bad WB high school sitcom. 
We’re glad the federal government has yet to take the 
Orwellian step of banning the WikiLeaks website on federal 
computers. But we’re waiting for it.
The federal government should be ashamed of everything 
WikiLeaks brought to the international spotlight. 
As Ron Paul said on his Twitter, “In a free society, we 
are supposed to know the truth. In a society where truth be-comes treason, we are in big trouble.”
Year in review: U.S. has made a mess
This year started off in memorable fashion with the 
president’s State of the Union address, in which he notably criticized the Supreme Court and got a 
round of applause for disrespecting the judicial branch. The government fighting like children was a running theme of the year. 
And 2010’s government fighting wasn’t limited to in-
terparty quarrels either with the Tea Party emerging to force the Republicans further right than many of them care to be. 
After months of fighting in the legislature followed 
by back-door deals, we were reminded by Democrats in 
Congress that we’re a representative democracy when it 
passed health care legislation the majority of Americans didn’t support. 
Maybe Congress looked to the future and wanted to 
make sure it could get cheaper health care during its future unemployment? 
Either way, it’s been a banner year for the U.S. Con-
gress. 
And if Americans thought this was the worst it could 
get, they really weren’t prepared for much. 
The negligence of BP resulted in an explosion of  the 
Deepwater Horizon oil rig that would eventually turn out to become the worst environmental disaster in U.S. 
history.
But 2010 wasn’t all bad news. 
In August, President Barack Obama declared an end 
to the combat mission in Iraq with all combat troops re-moved from the nation.  
More good news in 2010 — albeit short-lived — came 
at the judicial hands of Judge Virginia Phillips when she had the intelligence and the common sense to do what Washington didn’t have the moral-ity to do when she overturned the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. 
But alas, the elected govern-
ment continued to show its inad-equacy by challenging the ruling. Furthermore, it hasn’t been able to 
overturn the policy in the Senate 
despite having a lame-duck session 
and a Pentagon study that shows allowing openly gay men and women to serve in the military would have no negative effects. 
After more months of government bickering, we fi-
nally had the elections. 
The good news: We no longer have to hear any more 
political ads for two more years.
 The bad news: It meant that the people of Florida 
had elected a governor who paid his way to Tallahas-see, and they  overwhelmingly elected a Tea Party sena-tor. 
And although Florida’s silver-medal winner in the 
gubernatorial race wasn’t a much better option, Florida most assuredly chose the worse of two evils. 
So here we stand in early December with our mili-
tary still as blatantly discriminatory as ever, no gov-
ernment budget worked out for the upcoming years, 
an economy that’s still a mess, and a split government with both poliyical sides appearing unable or unwilling to compromise. 
What is the good news? 
There’s always 2011.

American humorist Will Rogers once 
said, “Diplomacy is the art of say-ing ‘nice doggy,’ until you can find a 
rock.” In the case of North Korea, the United States is dealing with a crazy pit bull and has 
few rocks left to throw.
The North’s recent shelling of a South 
Korean city, an attack that killed four and 
injured 16, opens the door for the United Nations to represent the international com-munity by standing with the U.S. and South Korea to oppose North Korean aggression. When the U.S. invaded Iraq seven years ago, it made the U.N. politically irrelevant on the 
international stage. But the status quo of to-
day is not the status quo of 2003. Today, the U.S. cannot afford to become unilaterally em-broiled in another foreign conflict if the Ko-rean situation worsens. Only with the help of an active, supportive U.N. can North Korea be held accountable for further aggression, which at this point could mean war.
To continue with Rogers’ metaphor, let us 
consider a neighborhood that America must defend against vicious dogs. Ten years ago, the neighborhood was pretty nice. America 
had a lot of rocks and there were not a whole 
lot of dogs. The neighborhood had been safe ever since that Russian terrier up and died without a single rock being thrown. But then came 9/11, and a new breed of animal came into the neighborhood. It was some kind of stray. No one knew where it came from or who owned it, but some of the worst neighbors on the block were said to feed it 
scraps. America remembered seeing it years 
before, when it used the stray to attack that old Samoyed. After the stray wounded the beast, America had patted its head and left it alone. America thought the stray would just go away and die – or something like that.
Then came Sept. 11, and America realized how dangerous that stray actually was. The neighborhood came together, gath-
ered up all of its stones and hurled them at 
the snarling stray. But the stray disappeared 
and nobody could find it. America decided to take the offensive and identify any other possible strays in the neighborhood. It wrote up a list and identified three: the mean Iraqi mongrel, the Iranian wolf and the vicious North Korean pit bull. Against the advice of its weaker neighbors, America picked up its stones and hurled them at the mongrel, 
knocking it dead. Feeling slighted and a lit-
tle embarrassed that they couldn’t throw as well, the other neighbors gathered all their stones and refused to let America have any more.
Now, the North Korean pit bull has at-
tacked an innocent ally, South Korea, and the United States is low on rocks. Logically, the neighborhood (the international community working through the United Nations) needs to collect their rocks (their combined military and diplomatic power), join America and get 
behind their wounded ally. If the North at-
tacks again – possibly even harder this time – and the international community does nothing, the civilized world effectively tells North Korea and other brutal, violent re-gimes that they can go so far as to physically attack neighboring countries and no one will stop them.
The situation in the Koreas is tense and 
uncertain. The U.S. and South Korea are engaged in war games, which the North has hypocritically warned may cause “full-blown war.”

Chocolate milk, a beverage commonly consumed by chil-
dren, is now being used as a sports recovery drink for people of all ages. Karp, Johnston, Tecklenburg, Mick-
leborough, Fly and Stager  established that it can help to re-hydrate the body and rebuild muscles during and after work-
outs or athletic events. Maybe that is not surprising, because 
the contents of chocolate milk include carbohydrates, protein, vitamin A, vitamin D and calcium, all of which contribute to rebuilding muscle. Also present are sodium and sugar, which help stabilize and restore the body’s electrolyte balance.
By contrast, energy drinks, which are popular among youth and some active people, contain large amounts of caffeine and sugar, along with ingredients such as guarana, ginseng, green tea and vitamins.
So, which is better for refueling the body after a workout: 
chocolate milk or energy drinks? Two recent studies have ad-dressed this question.
Thomas, Morris and Stevenson showed the difference be-
tween chocolate milk and two other replacement drinks (fluid and carbohydrate energy drinks) when consumed by nine well-trained male bicyclists before and during low to moder -ate exercise. In the study , “participants cycled 51 percent and 43 percent longer after ingesting chocolate milk than after in-gesting carbohydrate replacement drink and fluid replacement drink, respectively.”
Pritchett, Bishop, Pritchett, Green and Katica compared 
chocolate milk and a similar carbohydrate replacement bever -
age among 10 well-trained male bicyclists before and during high-intensity exercise.

David Parsons, left, and George Butz compete in a cornhole tournament on the pool deck of 
the Holiday Inn located on University Avenue on Sunday afternoon. 
STUDENT ACTIVISM
By MATTHEW RIVA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Beanbags and sparks flew on the 
windy roof above Beef ‘O’ Brady’s at 
the Holiday Inn on Sunday afternoon.
A double-elimination cornhole tour -
nament, organized by the MicroFinance 
Foundation, drew about 15 people to raise money for microloans for Zim-
babwe. The group collected about $60 
from the teams.
Six teams competed for more than 
an hour and a half. The members of 
the team Sam Bradford Doesn’t Have 
S--- On Us, Stephen Sawicki and Mark Trouville, placed first in the bracket af-ter a winning streak.
Event co-organizer David Parsons 
said it is the goal of the MicroFinance Society to provide small loans to Zim-babwe, which has the lowest standard of living of any country, according to the UN Human Development Index.
“Even a few hundred dollars would 
help,” Parsons said.
Parsons and his teammate, Andrew 
Amend, placed second with their team, 
Table Athletic Guy. 
Chapter President Bastian Bocken-
huser, 25, is hoping to get the group 
a nonprofit status soon so it can begin taking private donations in addition 
to having fundraisers like the tourna-
ment.
The group is not an official club with 
UF’s Student Government because it 
cannot apply until May, Parsons said. 
Right now, they are part of the War -
rington College of Business Adminis-tration.
The club is working on just getting 
money to Zimbabwe, and Parsons has learned something from the fundraiser: Sam Bradford clearly doesn’t have any-thing on them.Students use cornhole to

Getting enough sleep and eating right are important for success
2. Catch some Z’s
The ever-so-tricky all-nighter: 
Does it hinder more than it helps?  Yes. Not only will your irritability in-crease when you’re sleep deprived, 
but so will your inability to make 
good decisions and your chances of making careless errors.  
You also don’t retain informa-
tion when you’re overly tired, Kazi-mour said. If you get to the bottom of a page you just read and don’t remember anything, you have to do it all over again, which is why lack 
of sleep also causes a decrease in ef-
ficiency and patience.  The brain needs the kind of rest 
it gets during the restorative cycle of deep sleep. Kazimour recommend-ed at least five hours of sleep as part of the preparation for an exam.
3. Mind over matter: Have a pos-
itive outlook
Something that usually comes 
with stress is a negative mindset to-ward your own abilities. However, with this kind of mentality , you’re much less likely to remain calm and focused in order to get things done. Kazimour said that mindset has a huge impact on actual stress 
levels on an individual. Her advice?  
“Think about what you would say to someone else.  Be as nice to your -self as you would for them.”
Say things to yourself like, “Next 
week will be better.”  With this men-tality , you’re more likely to remain calm and focused in order to get things done, as opposed to giving 
yourself the negative and increasing 
how bad you feel about 
the situation.
4. Get your blood 
flowing
Kazimour and UF nutrition-
ist Linda Bobroff both agree that physical activity is the most effective mood lifter. Exercise burns cortisol, 
the hormone the brain produces 
during stress.  
But for those of you who don’t happen to be exercise enthusiasts, don’t fret. It doesn’t need to be vig-orous exercise like running or kick-boxing that saves you from your mid-study slump.  
“When you’re studying and go-
ing at it, you probably don’t have time to go out for a run,” Bobroff said. 
Instead, stretch a little or go for a 
leisurely walk. It can even be a walk around the library if you’re too busy focusing to leave.  As long as you’re being physical, you’re helping blood flow to the brain, which will help 
with productivity and alertness.
5. You are what you eat
Changing what and when you eat can have a positive effect on your mood. By eating every four to five hours and limiting refined carbo-hydrates like soda, candy and fruit juice, you can lessen volatile blood sugar swings and level out your 
mood, Kazimour said. 
She also said to incorporate pro-
tein with meals and snacks when-
ever possible. It slows down the absorption of carbohydrates in the blood, leaving you feeling upbeat for hours. 
Omega-3 fatty acids, mainly 
found in fish, have been found to 
improve mood and mental perfor -
mance and possibly alleviate de-
pression, Kazimour said.

Things looked bleak for the Gators as they trailed in 
the fifth set by scores of 12-7, 14-13 and 15-14. However, 
the Gators battled to the end, rallying to victory and 
closing the Seminoles’ season.
“We’ve been in high drama, and second-round 
matches are some of the best in the tournament,” Wise 
said. “With very little preparation time from one match 
to the next, you’re playing a team that’s just coming 
off a big win. Oh yeah: and it’s Florida State and they played terrific.” 
Junior middle blocker Cassandra Anderson came up 
big on defense for the Gators, recording a match-high 12 
blocks along with eight digs. Florida had a higher hitting percentage and recorded 
more kills, assists, service aces, digs and blocks than the 
Seminoles. 
However, the Gators also had six more service errors 
and four more attack errors.
The Gators will take on Purdue (23-10) on Friday 
in Austin, Texas. Purdue — Wise’s alma mater—is the tournament’s 16th seed.
“I was thinking ‘7-12,’” Wise said. “This team has 
been here before. We were down 7-12 against Nebras-ka in Omaha, and this team came back and won, so I shouldn’t doubt them. I just knew that at that specific 
point there was no room for error. We had to play per -
fect. The effort level and some of those digs were just 
outstanding. Some nights when it’s not going well, you’re lucky and you move on.”MONDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2010 n ALLIGATOR, 13

UF SWIMMING

They train with championship 
finishes in mind. For some of the 
younger UF swimmers and div-
ers, this weekend was their first 
taste of why they put in those long 
hours.
Florida carried a mere 30-man 
roster to Princeton’s Big Al Open 
this weekend, offering some 
championship exposure for 13 of 
the squad’s freshmen. 
“It was good preparation for 
the end of the year to be prepared to swim fast all six sessions and 
leave no room for errors,” fresh-
man swimmer Alicia Mathieu 
said. 
The men’s  and women’s squad 
placed second in the Open.
The Gators entered the three-
day, 36-event competition rested, reducing yardage in the pool prior 
to competition to see how a break could translate to the pool.
The team racked up a slew 
of personal bests, including Ma-
thieu’s 500-yard freestyle time of 
4:47.66, an NCAA qualifying time. 
Other milestones include sopho-
more Sharla Milne’s first win of the season in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:47.53, just edging 
second-place Mathieu. Freshmen 
Trish Regan, Ellese Zalewski and 
Brad deBorde also clocked per -
sonal bests. 
In the first event of the final 
day, Mathieu dominated the 
women’s 1650-yard freestyle, set-
ting a promising tone for the rest 
of the day’s competition.
“We came back [Sunday] with 
a new focus and it showed with 
some outstanding swims,” asso-
ciate head coach Martyn Wilby 
said. 
Following Mathieu’s win were 
top-place nabs by sophomore Jon-
athan Jordan in the men’s 1,650-
yard freestyle, Zalewski in the 
women’s 100-yard freestyle and 
the 200-yard butterfly, and junior 
Gabriel Huen in the men’s 200-yard butterfly.  Diving Dominates First Day: 
On the kickoff of the Open, the 
diving squad swept the competi-
tion, snagging the top two spots in 
the women’s three-meter and the 
men’s one-meter. The women’s 
sole senior diver, Monica Dodson, 
placed just ahead of junior Kaylee Doback. And junior Anthony Lew-
ark edged fellow junior Colin Bell.
Come championship time, ev-
ery point counts, something Dod-
son said is crucial when the Gators perform on the diving board. 
“Diving has become a much 
bigger influence on our team than 
in the past, especially with tough-
er teams,” she said. “It’s the extra points at the other end of the pool 
that can make a difference.”
The diving squad also gained 
crucial exposure as all divers par -
ticipated in each of the events the Open had to offer this weekend. 
“Coming and diving in a long 
weekend meet like this is good 
practice for both SECs and NCAAs 
— they’re both very long weeks and very tiring and stressful,” 
Lewark said. “This meet is defi-nitely going to help us as we head toward our two biggest meets of 
the year.”Gators finish 2nd at Big Al Open

“We are excited to hear that we are going 
to the Outback Bowl and play in another New 
Year’s Day game,” coach Urban Meyer said in a 
statement.
 “We are proud of our history of playing in 
January Bowl games — not everyone gets to en-
joy that experience. We’ve been fortunate around 
here to be in a bowl game for 20 consecutive 
years, and I’ve told our players and staff to not take that for granted.”
In his first season as UF coach, Meyer led the 
Gators to a 31-24 victory against Iowa in the Out-
back Bowl. That was the last time Florida participated in the game.
The Jan. 1 meeting will fea-
ture a showdown between two of the country’s premier col-lege football coaches in Meyer 
and Joe Paterno, who won his 400th game on Nov. 6 against 
Northwestern and is the all-time leader in FBS victories.
“We look forward to facing Penn State and 
one of the true legends in the game in coach 
Joe Paterno,” Meyer said. “I have a tremendous 
amount of respect for coach Paterno and I will be honored to have the opportunity to coach in the same game as him.” 
The Gators and the Nittany Lions have faced 
off twice, with UF winning both of the match-ups. The last time the two teams met up, Florida beat Penn State 21-6 in the Citrus Bowl on Jan. 1, 1998.Bowl features coaching

POLL QUESTION TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETT SCOREBOARDn SIX UF PLAYERS FINISHED 
WITH AT LEAST SEVEN SHOT 
ATTEMPTS.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
WASHINGTON, D.C. — After 
a week in which two dismal scor -
ing performances resulted in the 
season’s second loss, the Gators came out Sunday with what se-nior Chandler Parsons called the 
best half of basketball they have 
played this season.
Florida scored only 30 points 
over the first 20 minutes, but it did so without any of the selfish 
and disjointed play that resulted 
in a defeat against UCF. 
Instead, the No. 18 Gators 
(6-2) made smart decisions and 
moved the ball with precision as 
they defeated American (5-3) 67-48 in the Verizon Center in Wash-ington, D.C.
“Tonight I think the first half 
was the best offensive half we’ve had all year just from the stand-point of running offense, execut-ing, and making the extra pass,” 
Parsons said. “We’re going to 
knock down shots so we’re not going to worry about that. We’re 
just working on getting the best available one.”
Florida’s commitment to self-
lessness and ball distribution 
yielded 14 assists compared to just six turnovers for Sunday’s starters. 
Those numbers mark a major improvement from the season’s 
first seven contests, over which 
the unit had 69 assists and 75 turnovers. 
“We just wanted to share 
the ball and get back to Florida 
basketball,” sophomore Erving Walker said. “Just trying to not force plays, making the extra 
pass, hustling on defense and things like that.”
That willingness to pass led to 
an even shot distribution, as six 
players finished with seven, eight or nine shot attempts. 
As American switched be-
tween man and zone defenses, 
different areas of the floor started to open up for the Gators, who were willing to take whatever the 
Eagles gave them. 
“I think that’s our identity,” 
Parsons said. “That’s what type 
of team we should be. We’ve got 
nobody going out there trying to 
get 20 or 30 points per game.”
In the days leading up to the 
contest, coach Billy Donovan stressed the team’s need to focus 
on the things they could control. 
Instead of worrying about 
whether a specific shot goes in, 
Donovan said players should be 
worried about shot selection and 
the passes that lead to an open look. 
That mindset is the reason 
Donovan was pleased with the 
play of sophomore Kenny Boyn-
ton, who had seven assists and zero turnovers but also went 0 for 9 from the field in a scoreless 
effort. 
“The minute the ball leaves 
your hand, gravity has more con-
trol than actually you do,” Dono-van said. “I’m more proud that he played the right way. As long 
as our team is getting good shots

After a disappointing sea-
son, the Gators received some 
surprising news.
On Sunday, Florida (7-5) 
accepted an invitation to play 
in the Outback Bowl in Tam-pa on Jan. 1 at 1 p.m. against 
Penn State (7-5).  
The Gators were selected 
ahead of South Carolina and Mississippi State — two 
teams that beat UF in the Swamp this season — to play 
in the game.

in the week, many thought Florida would

Year’s Day bowl in Jackson-ville.UF to face Penn St. 
in Outback BowlBy MATT RUBIN

Florida played its last home match of this sea-
son Saturday night and it was arguably the most 
exciting match ever to be played in Gainesville.
The No. 1 Gators (29-1, 20-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) defeated Florida State in a breathtaking 
five-set match 3-2 (20-25, 25-22, 22-25, 25-21, 17-15) to advance to the NCAA regional semifinals.
“This match lived up to its billing, and I can’t 
say enough good things about how well Florida State played,” coach Mary Wise said. “I don’t think we’ve played a team all year that has passed 
as consistently as they did.”
The match between the rivals was one of ups 
and downs for both sides. There were eight ties 
in the first set, none in a close second set, four in the third set, 10 in the fourth set and eight in the 
fifth set.
“To make a run in this tournament you got to be healthy, you got to have some pretty good tal-
ent and once in a while along the way you got to catch a break,” Wise said. “I think we caught a break tonight.” 
Junior setter Kelly Murphy led the Gators 
with a triple double. Murphy 
hit .385 on her way to recording a match-high 19 kills, 21 assists and 12 digs. She also recorded 
two blocks.
Murphy also became the 17th 
player in UF history to record 
1,000 kills.
“It would have been pretty 
bittersweet to have our season end with a loss to Florida State,” Murphy said. 
“I just think that any second round match with 
any team playing in their possible last match of 
the season is bound to be exciting.”Gators survive five-set thriller

I have no problem with it.”
The Gators other four starters all scored 
in double figures, led by Walker’s 16. The 
sophomore connected on 4 of 6 three-point 
attempts, including a critical basket with 10:26 remaining after AU had trimmed UF’s lead to eight, the smallest it would be 
in the second half. Seniors Parsons and Alex Tyus both 
bounced back from poor performances 
against UCF, shooting a combined 10 for 15 after going 1 for 14 collectively against the Knights. 
Macklin, on the other hand, picked up 
right where he left off in Wednesday’s loss. 
The senior followed that 20-point per -
formance with five points in the first 4:36 Sunday on his way to 12 for the game. 
Macklin also recorded 
four rebounds and two blocks in his first game back at the Verizon Cen-
ter since playing there 
as a Georgetown Hoya 
during his freshman and 
sophomore seasons. Macklin was pleased he could put on a 
good show for his mom, Sonya, and broth-
er, Eugene, who made the trip from his 
nearby hometown of Portsmouth, Va.

Florida finally showed its youth.
Before Saturday’s dismantling 
of Providence College, 10 points or fewer had decided each game and the inexperienced Gators had to 
fight for every victory . 
The Gators won four of those 
despite shooting under 40 percent 
from the field. But that wasn’t the case Sunday . Needing a win to clinch its sec-
ond tournament title of the sea-son, Florida (7-2) fell flat and was shocked 56-50 by Brown (3-6) in the final game of the Brown Bear Classic in Providence, R.I.
“Name an aspect of the game, 
and that’s where it was decided,” 
coach Amanda Butler said when 
asked to pinpoint her team’s strug-gles. “They shot better than us. They defended better than us. We were out-coached. We were out-hustled. We didn’t come to play.”
The loss came at the hands of a Brown team that was held to just 10 first-half points against Providence in the tournament opener.
The Gators defeated Providence 
handily on Satur -
day to the tune of 73-56, but nothing went Florida’s way on Sunday.
Shooting again 
was a culprit as Florida (30.6 per -
cent) missed early and often. Brown recognized Florida’s desire to feed the low post and clogged the pass-ing lanes inside, forcing 17 turnovers and 11 steals. 
Trailing by one point at half, 
Florida came out and traded buck-ets with Brown to open the second. But after making three out of its first four attempts to open the half, Flori-da missed seven consecutive shots,
“Our biggest issue today was we 
lacked complete maturity and lead-
ership,” Butler said. “Clearly, we’ve 
got to get a lot better.”
The Bears had a knack for nailing 
shots each time the Gators would cut into Brown’s lead and it began to manifest itself into UF mistakes.
Florida fouled Brown twice as the shot clock was expiring. And within  striking distance with mere min-utes remaining, the Gators’ guards seemed content to milk to clock on offense and not press the action. 
A small bright spot for the Gators 
was the first-career double-double for freshman forward Deaundra Young (10 points, 10 rebounds) and 
the second in a row for Ndidi Madu 
(14 points, 11 rebounds).
“We’re just not very mature. 
It’s really disappointing in every aspect,” Butler said. “We’ll just go back, get ready to play and figure out who wants to compete.”

n THE TWO TEAMS HAVE NEVER 
PLAYED IN A BCS TITLE GAME.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
EUGENE, Ore. — A season spent talk-
ing about BCS busters will end with an-
other clash of the big boys — just not the ones we’ve gotten used to seeing in the title 
game.
Alabama and Texas? Florida and Okla-
homa? Ohio State? Southern California?
Not this year.
BCS title game first-timers Auburn and 
Oregon will bring perfect records and po-tent offenses to Glendale, Ariz., for their Jan. 10 matchup.
The Bowl Championship Series were 
made official Sunday night, a formality af-ter the top-ranked Tigers and No. 2 Ducks completed unbeaten seasons Saturday.
Oregon players gathered with friends 
and family in a lounge at the athletic com-plex on campus to watch as the BCS lineup was revealed on television. There wasn’t a peep in the room when Oregon popped up on the screen at No. 2 in the final BCS stand-
ings behind first-place Auburn.
“There was no surprise to anybody that 
we were going to be one or two,” defensive 
tackle Brandon Bair said. “I think you’d 
have had a great response if you’d seen us down there four or five.”
Across the country, Auburn linebacker 
Craig Stevens had trouble putting his emo-tions into words. “It’s just an amazing feel-ing,” he said. “We’ve put in all that hard work (to) see our dreams unfold.”
Those outsiders from TCU and Boise 
State were closer than ever before to play-ing for college football’s biggest prize. But the third-ranked Horned Frogs, the nation’s only other undefeated team, couldn’t over -
come playing in the lightly regarded Moun-tain West Conference and will have to settle for a trip to the Rose Bowl. As for Boise State, one loss was one too many, and the Broncos ended up out of the BCS altogether this season.
The other BCS matchups announced 
Sunday were: TCU against Big Ten co-champ Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl; Arkan-sas and Ohio State, which also won a share of the Big Ten title, in the Sugar Bowl; Big 12 champion Oklahoma taking on Big East co-champ Connecticut in the Fiesta Bowl; and No. 5 Stanford playing ACC title-winner Virginia Tech in the Orange Bowl.
While teams from the power conferences 
will play for the biggest prize of all, the Ti-gers and Ducks still represent a changing of the guard in their own way.
Since the BCS was born in 1998, its title 
game has almost always been stocked with college football’s blue bloods and programs 
with championship pedigrees.
Auburn has one national title to its credit 
— and it came in 1957. That’s one more than 
Oregon has. In fact, the Ducks are just the second team in the 13-year history of the BCS to reach the championship game look -
ing for the program’s first national title. Virginia Tech was the first in 1999.Auburn, Oregon to battle 
it out for national title
“It’s just an amazing feeling. 
We’ve put in all that hard work 
(to) see our dreams unfold.”
