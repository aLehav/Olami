The Board of Governors delayed its Bright 
Futures discussion until further notice at a 
meeting Thursday. 
The board had planned to talk about the 
scholarship’s aid for low-income families. 
At the meeting, the Board of Governors 
approved its 2015-2016 legislative budget request and updated its 2025 strategic plan goals. The approved legislative budget request 
includes $100 million in new performance funds that the State University System would match with $200 million in existing funds.
The money will go toward improving ar-
eas that are important to students and tax-
payers. 
“It’s important that we present an LBR 
(legislative budget request) that represents 
our greatest needs and provides a return in-vestment for the state and our students,” said Tim Jones, Board of Governors vice chancel-lor for ﬁ  nance and administration.
The strategic plan, a nationally recog-
nized accountability system, was also under review. Beginning this year, it will be re-viewed every ﬁ  ve years to keep performance indicators credible.
The Board also approved a legislative 
budget request to invest in the development of e-textbooks. It requested a $227,000 invest-ment in Orange Grove Text Plus, an open-access textbook initiative and arm of the Uni-
versity Press of Florida.
“It’s (LBR) dedicated to reducing the high 
costs of textbooks students bear these days,” 
UF Provost Joe Glover said. “This process of collaboration certainly reduces costs across the system.”Board of Governors puts off Bright Futures talks

Gainesville residents will likely see high-
er utility rates next ﬁ  scal year after city ofﬁ  -
cials passed two measures Thursday night.
In a 6-1 vote, City Commission passed a 
water-rate increase for apartment complex-es. 
The increase creates a ﬂ  at rate for each 
apartment building’s unit, instead of divid-ing utility charges differently each month based on each building’s water gauge. 
The change applies to all multi-family 
homes, including townhomes, ﬂ  ats and du-plexes.
The new ﬂ  at rate of $3.05 per every 1,000 
gallons used will now apply to individual apartments. 
But some feel the measure directly targets 
students, who make up about half of Gaines-ville’s population.“If an increase is abso-
lutely necessary, then it should come at the cost of all Gainesville residents, not just those that live in apartments,” said UF Stu-
dent Government Sena-tor and graduate student Chris Weaver. 
The increase puts local rates on par with 
higher rates across the state, said Gainesville Regional Utilities general manager Kathy Viehe, making up for years of underpay-ments from multi-family homes. Though the rate change will mean a 50-
cent increase for single-family homes for ev-ery 7,000 gallons of water used, apartments will see an increase of $2.25 for every 3,000 gallons used.
City Commission also passed a measure 
ending GRU’s use of mountaintop coal, the culmination of Gainesville Loves Moun-tains’ three-and-a-half year battle to stop the practice . 
The controversial technique involves lit-
erally blasting off the tops of mountains to

Music is keeping UF stu-
dents up day and night, accord-
ing to a new Spotify study.
In the top 40 musical univer-
sities study released Tuesday, Spotify found that UF students are listening to Kid Cudi more 
than students at other schools.
But the data also showed 
UF students are not on Lorde’s 
team.
Spotify based their list on 
data from students using the Spotify Premium student deal and then ranked the univer-sities by who listened to the 
most music on the site.
Florida State University and 
University of Central Florida 
also made the list.
According to the study, 
UF has a taste for steel drums and tropical music but not for Christian music.
The accessibility students 
have to different genres makes their listening habits different, said Breana Auberry, presi-dent and co-founder of Swamp Records.
“There’s deﬁ  nitely a divide 
in Gainesville’s music commu-nity,” Auberry, a 21-year-old UF advertising seniors, said.

Roll the Dice
Lawson Nuland, a 19-year-old UF mechanical and aerospace engineering sophomore, watches the dice 
roll at the Bright Futures scholarship ice cream social on the North Lawn on Thursday.
It might result in $1.65 million expense
access seams of coal underneath. The result is cata-
strophic for nearby streams and valleys where the re-sulting waste is dumped. 
In his opening remarks, Appalachian Voices di-
rector of programs Matthew Wasson said the coal mining is leveling mountains across the Appalachian area, leaving streams contaminated with waste and contributing to higher cancer rates.
Supporters of the proposal filled the room to near 
capacity wearing white and blue “I heart mountains” buttons. 
“This is the kind of problem that is happening right 
in people’s backyards,” Wasson said. GRU will now commit to spending up to 5 percent 
more to buy coal from sources that deep mine their coal instead, could result in fuel expenses anywhere up to $1.65 million. 
If the costs go over 5 percent, City Commission can 
vote to temporarily suspend the policy. 
City Commissioner Lauren Poe said the increase 
will most likely be around 2.5 percent, which equates to 48 cents more per month for customers. 
“That is a small price to pay,” Poe said.students’ Spotify selections 
included Kanye West, Drake, Coldplay and Calvin Harris.
UF students and most col-
lege students stream Spotify at about 4 p.m., the study also revealed.
The study does not reflect 
the entire UF student body. The data for the study was gathered from students who pay $5 to avoid ads on their 
Spotify accounts.
From a socio-economic 
standpoint, the data is skewed 
to those who can pay for that 
luxury, said Colin Harte, UF 
lecturer and Ph.D. fellow in ethnomusicology.
Compared with the other 
schools, UF students listen to 
more dance, hip-hop and R&B 
music than other schools but not as much rock.
Rock is becoming less inno-
vative with less of an influence on today’s generation of music listeners, Auberry said.
Your music taste depends 
on where you’re from, said 
Ximena Jaramillo, an 18-year-
old UF digital arts and sciences freshman.
Along with University of 
Pennsylvania and University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, UF ranked as a top Latin music school.  
“We have a huge His-
panic-Latino community in 
Gainesville,” wrote Heather 
Halak, 20-year-old English and linguistics senior and Spotify campus influencer president at UF, in an email.
“I’m happy so many of us 
are taking control of what we hear with streaming apps like Spotify instead of hearing the 
same song four times in an 
hour,” she said.

The UF College of Engineering received a 
$1 million donation for the construction of a 
five-story engineering hub. 
Subroto Bagchi and his wife, Susmita, do-
nated to the construction of the Innovation 
Nexus Building. Bagchi is chairman of Mind-
tree, an international information technology and outsourcing company based in India.
The college has already received $3 million 
for the $53 million building, which will be lo-cated near the Reitz Union. 
Subroto Bagchi has had a relationship with the College of Engineering since 2011, after UF and the state of Florida invited the company to start a U.S. Development Center in Gainesville, according to a UF press release.
Helen Goh, director of marketing and com-
munications for the college, wrote in an email 
that many engineering schools across the 
country have an engineering hub, and UF will finally have its own. 
“What we have is ‘East Hall – Living and 
Learning Community’,” she wrote. “But what we need is a collision space where students can think, learn, have hands-on engineering experience with fellow students as well as with faculty.”
While a construction date for the project 
has yet to be set, the university is still receiving donations. 
The building, designed by a London-based 
architecture firm called Grimshaw, will be a 
part of the college’s contribution to UF’s pre-
eminence initiative. 
Students at the College of Engineering can 
expect to use a prototyping lab, an advanced manufacturing facility and a design lab for freshmen.
Luis Chong, a 20-year-old UF engineering 
junior, said he is disappointed he might miss out on the development but is excited for the future of UF’s engineers.
“I think it’s a good way to increase the qual-
ity of education of the students here,” he said. “Especially since more engineering students keep entering the program.”
The drawings for the project will be re-
leased at the end of the year.
“Our goal is to see further improvement in 
graduation rates, closer ties with industry and a direct enhancement on the State’s workforce development efforts,” Cammy Abernathy,  UF College of Engineering dean, said in an official statement. College of Engineering receives $1 million for new building

The world’s largest synchronized dance event 
makes its return to Maddox Ranch in Lakeland this 
weekend.
Now in its fourth year, Earthdance Florida is one 
of more than 300 locations worldwide participating 
in a global peace party Thursday through Sunday.
Started in 1997 by London-based musician Chris 
Deckker, Earthdance aims to create peace through music, dancing and international participation. 
Central to its vision is the synchronized “global link-up” and “Prayer for Peace.”
Earthdance Florida will begin its prayer at 7 p.m. 
Saturday, synchronized with locations throughout the globe.
The event will feature mystical art galleries, 
workshops and two music stages.
Earthdance Florida will donate a portion of its 
proceeds to the Salvation Army George W. Jenkins Community of Hope, which provides transitional housing for homeless families in Lakeland and Polk 
County.
Musical acts will include drum-and-bass origi-
nator Aphrodite, electronica artists Govinda, Phu-
tureprimitive, Random Rab and more than 75 other acts, including several local artists.
Paul Hunt, known by his stage name, Illterror, is 
among those local acts. Hunt has performed at two previous Earthdances and said he enjoys being able to perform outside and camp out for the weekend — a welcome change from the club gigs he typically 
performs at.
“I’m excited there (are) more bands playing and 
(a) more diverse line-up (than) years past,” Hunt 
wrote in an email. “I have a ton of friends playing so I’m excited to see them perform.”
Tickets are available at the gate for $110 through 
Friday, including the cost of camping. Prices drop to $80 on Saturday and then $20 on Sunday.
Tents and camping gear are available to rent at 
the venue.
Matt and Belinda Pettinato, of Controlled Chaos 
Productions LLC, started Earthdance Florida in 2009 in Plant City. They moved it to Sarasota in 2010 and finally settled into their home at Maddox Ranch in Lakeland in 2011.
Pettinato said the “Prayer for Peace” inspired 
her and her partner to bring the Earthdance experi-ence to Florida.
“Sharing the same prayer with over 100,000 
people at the same moment touched my heart,” Pettinato said.
Pettinato said Earthdance differs from other 
music festivals because of the involvement of the attendees.
“You’re not just there to stare at a stage,” she 
said. “You’re there to co-create together.”
She hopes attendees will take something away 
when they leave the festival.
“I want them to be inspired, to fill their hearts 
with love and inspiration and to bring it home and share it with everyone,” Pettinato said.Largest synchronized dance,

enough punishment for Jameis Winston?Take your relationship to the condom zone
If you’ve watched TV in the past week, speciﬁ  cally 
MTV, you’ve probably noticed something outside the normal ads for Teen Wolf or toothpaste.
Trojan and MTV have partnered to create a media cam-
paign, complete with condom commercials — consider 
this my petition to call them “condommercials” hence-
forth — and safer sex information.
The series of commercials features a couple discussing 
their relationship level with each other and with friends. They’re in the leaving-a-toothbrush-at-my-apartment zone, the let’s-try-new-things-together zone and the “Co Zone,” short for condom zone.
Basically, they love condoms, and you should, too.The goal of the campaign, according to a New York 
Times article, is “to encourage couples who see each other regularly to use condoms each time they have sex.”
The campaign launched around the same time Tro-
jan released results to a new condom survey, which only serves as more evidence as to why you should wrap it be-fore you tap it.
According to the survey, only 35 percent of young 
adults ages 18 to 34 reported always using a condom, even though 80 percent said condom use is important.
Apparently, although young people believe condom 
use is important, their behaviors don’t seem to correspond with their beliefs. The 2009 GatorWell Sexual Health Stu-dent Survey reported that only 31.7 percent of sexually active UF students used a condom every time they had vaginal intercourse in the past year.
Trojan and MTV deserve praise for trying to create a 
fun and relatable campaign to increase condom use.
There’s still a big stigma around condoms, and maybe 
this campaign will help reduce it.
There are a number of obstacles toward advertising 
condoms and advocating their use. Some condom compa-nies have been banned from advertising on Twitter, for example. I personally experienced the stigma against con-doms when I was advised by a representative with Stu-dent Activities and Involvement against distributing them on campus.People — particularly horny 
young adults, MTV’s major tar-get audience — are going to have sex. It’s inevitable.
Promoting condom use in 
popular media, exposing people to safer sex options and, most im-portantly, actually giving them access to contraceptives isn’t go-ing to make them have more sex. 
It will simply increase the likelihood that they engage in safer sex.
Coming from someone who always carries at least two 
condoms on my person — hey, sometimes one just isn’t 
enough — I don’t get the fuss about using a condom.
Even if you and your partner aren’t worried about pre-
venting pregnancy — maybe you use a hormonal form 
of contraceptive for that — condoms still act as a barrier method to protect against sexually transmitted infections.
One in two sexually active young people will contract 
an STI by the age of 25. If that doesn’t make you want to run to CVS and pick up a box of condoms, I don’t know what will.
If you’re worried about the expense of purchasing a 
condom supply, UF students have a number of resources for free contraceptives.Condoms are offered at the Student Health Care Center building, around campus at GatorWell Health Huts and at the Planned Parenthood on 13th Street. That’s just one more reason to love being a Gator.
If you insist on only using condoms that you purchase 
yourself from the store, the return on investment is still pretty good — about 114,000 percent in comparison to 
raising a child, according to GQ.
So if you and your partner are already in the eat-cold-
pizza-in-bed-together zone, the hold-my-hair-back-while-
I-puke-at-this-party zone, or the I-haven’t-stayed-at-my-own-apartment-in-weeks zone, consider taking a cue from Trojan and entering the condom zone, too.

Throughout her time in ofﬁ  ce, Florida Attorney General 
Pam Bondi has been on a crusade against gay marriage. Bondi has represented the state of Florida in ﬁ  ve sepa-
rate lawsuits to argue in defense of the amendment passed 
by Florida voters in 2008 that banned same-sex marriage. In 
all ﬁ  ve cases, the judge ruled against her and said the ban 
was incompatible with the U.S. Constitution. Bondi has also fought to ensure that these rulings allowing same-sex mar-riage in Florida remain unenforced until the Supreme Court 
rules on the issue. Bondi herself is currently in her third mar-
riage. Bondi should change course and ﬁ  ght for the right of 
gay Floridians to have a third marriage, too. A just-give-up-
already DART goes to Pam Bondi.
Apple Inc.’s reputation as a company that values privacy 
has taken a big hit as of late. The recent hacking of iCloud accounts belonging to numerous celebrities sparked criticism about the technology giant’s security policies. Apple took 
a step in the right direction this week when it announced a 
number of new security measures. Most notably, the com-
pany announced that it will not unlock encrypted iPhones or iPads when it receives requests from law enforcement to do so. It’s probably still a bad idea to put your naked pictures 
in iCloud, though. We’re giving a password-protected LAU-
REL to Apple.
Few political careers have been as strange and dramatic as 
Rep. Mark Sanford’s, R-SC. Sanford came to national promi-
nence when he disappeared without a trace for several days in 2009. Although aides claimed he was “hiking the Appala-chian Trail,” Sanford later admitted to visiting his Argentine mistress, Maria Belen Chapur. The South Carolina State As-sembly censured Sanford after it was revealed that he used taxpayer funds to pay for his amorous excursion. For what-ever reason, South Carolina voters saw ﬁ  t to elect Sanford to Congress in 2013. Sanford’s bizarre behavior continued this week when he posted a rambling Facebook post announc-ing his breakup with Chapur. Unfortunately for Chapur, she found out about the breakup the same way everyone else did — by reading the Facebook post. Ouch. A left-the-family-
values-on-the-Appalachian-Trail DART goes to Mark San-
ford.
Florida State University is, once again, ﬂ  irting with disas-
ter after the controversial star quarterback Jameis Winston yelled an obscene sexual phrase in a public place on the FSU campus earlier this week. While FSU decided to suspend Winston for the ﬁ  rst half of Saturday’s game against Clem-son, a half-game suspension is — at the very least — a weak punishment, given that Winston was accused of rape in 2013. The decision sends a message that star athletes only get a slap on the wrist for the sake of salvaging a defending champion-ship. We say a full-game suspension — and the possibility of losing a crucial game — would knock common sense back into Winston. A shaming-shameless-Famous-Jameis DART 
goes to the ‘Noles.

The Accent Speaker’s Bureau hosted 
“A Conversation with Former Israe-li Ambassador Michael Oren and 
Journalist Rula Jebreal” Tuesday. 
It was its second attempt at addressing 
the Israeli-Palestinian issue, after having to cancel a similarly themed event last Spring. 
At that event, Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud 
Olmert was to be interviewed by journalist Rula Jeb-
real. 
Olmert canceled his appearance at UF and was 
subsequently convicted of receiving bribes. 
Delayed but undeterred, Accent brought us the se-
quel to the Olmert event —  not an interview, but a conversation between Jebreal and Oren. Representa-
tives from the event also invited Students for Justice 
in Palestine to participate. 
Although its offer may have been well-intentioned, 
Accent’s behavior indicates a pretty deep misunder-
standing of Palestinian issues on the parts of Accent 
and the Jewish Student Union. 
The Oren-Jebreal conversation misrepresents the 
Israeli-Palestinian conﬂ  ict as a dispute between two 
groups with equal grievances on either side. 
It mimics past attempts that Americans have made 
to coerce Palestinians and Israelis to have discussions and meetings, predicated on the assump-tion that the two just need to “work things out.” 
This approach not only ignores the un-
derlying issue — Israel’s occupation in the 
region — but also trivializes the grievances of the Pal-estinian people, who have been bombed, displaced, constrained, jailed and occupied. 
Furthermore, it creates a false image of inclusive-
ness and diversity. 
By inviting a Palestinian to a public forum, Accent 
pretends to represent both sides of the conﬂ  ict. It is clear, however, that no such balance exists. 
Jebreal’s role at Accent is similar to Juan Williams’ 
position at Fox News — she may belong to a minor-
ity group, but she’s been placed in an environment in 
which she serves the majority’s purpose. 
We do not wish to be involved in such a thinly 
veiled display of favoritism for a modern-day colo-
nialist government. 
SJP says “no, thank you” to being Accent’s token 
Palestinian group. 
Doing so would further subjugate the Palestinian 
people, which Accent has done enough of already.

done enough to offend PalestiniansGuest Column
Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Up-
ton, Ariana Grande, Victo-ria Justice and Mary Eliza-
beth Winstead are just a few of approximately 100 celebri-
ties whose nude photographs 
were posted anonymously to the website 4chan a couple of weeks ago. 
Afterward, many questioned 
the security of their devices and wondered who should be held accountable.
The average citizen lacks the 
requisite level of notoriety to worry about naked photos of themselves spreading like wild-ﬁ  re across the Internet. That isn’t to say that such an event happening to a celebrity doesn’t cause everyone to take a collec-tive gasp at the mere thought of such embarrassment. 
The heart of the issue is big-
ger than racy pictures. These photos have functioned to heighten public awareness re-garding the security, or lack thereof, of one’s private ﬁ  les. It’s not unreasonable to assume that many Americans deleted some questionable content from 
their own phones in response to 
the leaked photos. 
The New Yorker reported 
that computer science profes-sor Matthew Green at Johns Hopkins University provided two possibilities for the way these images found their way on to the Internet. The ﬁ  rst sug-
gests that a hacker — or hack-
ers — discovered a way into Apple’s iCloud, an application that allows users to store infor-mation on remote servers via the Internet.
The second option involves 
the Find My iPhone app, which helps owners ﬁ  nd their miss-
ing device and access ﬁ  les con-
tained in the iCloud. The prob-lem, until recently, was that Find My iPhone wouldn’t lock after failed login attempts.
For a hacker, this means that 
an algorithm could be imple-mented to run a series of pos-sible password combinations 
until the correct one is discov-
ered. With no lockout for failed passwords, a million attempts can be made in a relatively short amount of time without interruption.
It looks as though the del-
uge of celebrity photos were stolen from those using the iP-
hone. Representing 25 percent 
of the smartphone population, iPhone users have a reason to be concerned about the security of their devices. 
The iPhone is certainly more 
resilient to hacker attacks in the wake of recent events, as almost immediately after the photos in 
question began appearing on the web, Apple created a patch 
for Find My iPhone to prevent 
unauthorized access to iCloud. 
Although Apple denies an iCloud breach, the speed of the company’s technical response suggests culpability.
The stolen photos ignited a 
blame game across the Internet as to who should be held ac-countable. On a certain level, 
it’s natural for people to want 
to declare a responsible party; the someone-has-to-pay men-tality assuages public fear that something like this could hap-pen to them if they know where to place fault. 
Some may say Apple is to 
blame for failing to adequately 
protect its users. Some will 
argue it’s the fault of corrupt hackers for publishing the im-ages, and others will suggest that we should look to the ce-lebrities themselves. Of the three options, it seems sensible to suggest that each one shares a 
portion of the responsibility for 
the surfacing of the pictures. 
The responses of the celebri-
ties affected were as varied as the images themselves. Some chose to laugh the whole thing off, which was probably the 
right way to go. As for those 
who were incensed by the theft of their photos, it’s easy to feel inclined to suggest that they are the most deserving of cen-sure — after all, it’s their naked bodies they allowed to be pho-tographed in the ﬁ  rst place. 
It’s important to remember 
that no hardware or software is impenetrable. For every pro-grammer employed by Apple — or any company for that matter — to devise security fea-tures, there’s an equally knowl-edgeable hacker working to circumvent them.
Everyone has the right to 
snap as many nude photos as they’d like, but when taking photographs of this nature, one has to acknowledge the possi-bility that someone, or every-one, will see the images. 
If the photos make it to the 
Internet, that’s too bad for you. It’s not appropriate to be upset — if and when this happens — since the subject of the photo implicitly accepted any and all consequences the moment the picture was taken. When feel-ing compelled to take photos 
in the buff, always remember 
the cardinal rule of nude selﬁ  es: take it from the neck down.

Here in Gainesville, there 
are many places a citizen can go to get treatment for 
any illness. 
Most Americans are fortunate 
enough to have access to afford-able health care, and new reforms of the health care system have al-lowed even those with pre-existing conditions access to medical care. The American health care system is not the world’s best, but the U.S. does lead the world in developing the research and technology need-ed to battle illnesses of all kinds.
Unfortunately, the health care 
situation in West Africa is much worse. Ebola broke out in a bor-der region in March of this year, and the international response to combatting the disease has been slow. The World Health Organi-zation only declared the outbreak a world health emergency in Au-gust, the month in which the most single-month Ebola deaths in his-tory were recorded. 
Many African countries don’t 
have the necessary infrastructure to combat preventable diseases. Health care workers in these coun-tries are discouraged by the lack of infrastructure, and many of them have quit their jobs out of concern for their own health and safety. 
The dangers of practicing 
health care in Africa have led to a critical shortage of trained medical personnel. According to data from the WHO, Liberia has 1.4 doc-tors and 27.4 nurses per 100,000 people. Guinea has 10 doctors and 51.1 nurses per 100,000 people. Si-erra Leone has 2.2 doctors and 16.6 nurses per 100,000 people.
These numbers are barely 
enough to treat an outbreak of the common cold among a large popu-lation, let alone a devastating dis-ease like Ebola. The lack of medical 
expertise in Africa leads to distrust 
and fear of preventive health care. 
Other social issues, such as low lit-eracy rates and political instability, make stopping or slowing down 
these diseases even more difﬁ  cult.
In response to the African Ebola 
outbreak, the Obama administra-
tion has committed $175 million to combatting the disease. These 
funds will build 17 Ebola treatment 
units, including 1,700 hospital 
beds. The money will also be used to hire and train additional medi-cal personnel to accommodate the 
growing number of patients. The 
Obama administration also asked 
Congress for an additional $88 million, which will add to the re-lief effort by investing in vaccine 
development.
President Barack Obama called 
the outbreak “a national security 
threat.” Labeling the Ebola out-break as a threat to our interests 
indicates his belief that Africa’s 
problems are our problems, too.
Despite these strong words 
from the president, only fears of a 
potential American outbreak have 
legitimized the relief effort and 
forced people to ﬁ  nally pay atten-
tion to this horrible crisis. Fortu-nately, these unfounded fears may have the consequence of encourag-
ing members of Congress to act on this issue with a sense of urgency.
Tragically, the current Ebola 
efforts may simply be too little, 
too late. The disease has already claimed more than 1,800 lives this year — a number projected to in-crease signiﬁ  cantly in the near fu-ture — and no vaccine for the dis-ease has yet been developed. Beth Bell, a director at the Center for Disease Control, said that without effective interventions, the number of Ebola cases could skyrocket into the “hundreds of thousands.”
Additionally, the president’s 
military and national security lan-guage may be effective in mobiliz-ing action, but it ignores the social aspect of this crisis.
Because literacy is so low in 
parts of West Africa, information travels at a slow, unreliable pace. Relief efforts must ensure that health care ofﬁ  cials work to gain the trust of locals while also train-ing more African-born health care providers.
Other industrialized and de-
veloped nations must play a role in these efforts as well. The world looks to the U.S. for leadership, and rightly so. However, outbreaks re-quire quick, large-scale responses from all corners of the globe.
The response to the Ebola out-
break demonstrates how weak global health infrastructure actu-ally is. Hopefully, the U.S. and the global community will apply the lessons from the ongoing crisis to future health issues. If the world drags its feet,  public health prob-lems will only get worse.

The UF women’s tennis team begins its second

Coach Will Muschamp announced via Twitter on Thursday that quarterback Jeff Driskel, center Max Garcia, cornerback Vernon Hargreaves and punter Kyle Christy will be team captains against Alabama on Saturday.Taylor Tubbs and the UF cross country team are set to host their only race this year. Read the story at alligatorSports.org.With the Gators traveling to the 
great state of Alabama to take on the Crimson Tide this Saturday, the al-ligatorSports road crew will be mak-ing its first of two treks outside of 
Florida over the next three weeks. 
Gone are the days of strolling to 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium right be-
fore kickoff.
And we couldn’t be more excited 
for this to happen.
A football game between one of 
the perennial frontrunners for a na-tional title and a team that’s still de-termining where its production will peak is in order.
Let’s break down our journey to 
our destination to the immediate northwest by the numbers.
Two: The number of nights we’ll 
be staying in a Motel 6 with a two-star rating more than 40 minutes away from Bryant-Denny Stadium.
Five: The number of people fit-
ting into one car to make the trip possible.
Seven: The estimated number of 
hours the alligatorSports road crew will travel to make it to Tuscaloosa for the game if it goes non-stop.
25: The minimum amount of 
times Morgan Moriarty will bring up the name Todd Gurley before we even leave the state of Florida.
Let’s just stop talking about this 
trip while we’re somewhat still ahead. 
Hopefully we have a good play-
list to get us through that treacher-ous journey to Tuscaloosa.

a nightcap between No. 4 Oklahoma and West Virginia — are alligator-Sports editor Jordan McPherson and staff writer Morgan Moriarty.Picks

Florida learned a lot about it-
self against Kentucky.
The Gators (2-0, 1-0 Southeast-
ern Conference) found out that 
they can still contain the rush, al-lowing the Wildcats to gain just 81 yards on the ground. Outside 
of Kentucky quarterback Patrick 
Towles’ 24-yard scamper on his first rush attempt, Florida surren-dered just one run that was longer than 10 yards.
Florida discovered that Kyle 
Christy can still punt the ball. The senior booted six punts that went an average distance of 48.7 yards 
against Kentucky, looking like he 
did back in 2012 when he was a finalist for the Ray Guy Award. Half of his punts pinned the Wild-cats inside their 10-yard line.
But the Gators also saw that 
they still have room to improve.
And now that they are heading 
to Tuscaloosa, Ala., to take on the 
No. 3 Crimson Tide (3-0) for their 
first road game of the season.
“There’s some tough parts, 
now,” Buck linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. said. “You’re not used to different environments. Some-times it’s players’ first time out of state or on a plane, just being in 
different states. Just the environ-
ment.”
On defense, Florida has to 
make strides with its young sec-
ondary, a group that was burned 
on multiple occasions against Kentucky.“We need to improve, wheth-
er it’s playing in the slot, safety or corner,” coach Will Mus-
champ said. “It’s really across the 
board.”
On offense, Florida needs to 
see development on third down. For the season, the Gators are 11th 
in the SEC with a 40.5-percent 
conversion rate.
For offensive coordinator Kurt 
Roper, having success on first and 
second down will be Florida’s key to success.
“Long down and distances 
with these guys are going to bring a lot of issues on third down,” 
Roper said. “So you definitely want to stay on schedule, as ev-erybody likes to say. But at the same time, you’ve got to try to be 
aggressive and make plays down 
the field, too. It’s a balance. It makes third down more of a chal-lenge if you don’t stay in good 
situations that way.”Traveling to a hostile environ-
ment like Bryant-Denny Stadium 
is no light task, especially for the young group that Florida is bring-
ing.
But regardless of the venue, 
Florida just wants to play.
“It’s going to be pretty cool 
going into Alabama’s stadium,” 
quarterback Jeff Driskel said. “We haven’t been on the road yet and that’s a good way to start. I bet some of the guys will be a little 
wide-eyed at first but at the end 
of the day it’s playing football and that’s what we’re going to have to do.”

As its first month of the season comes to 
a close, Florida sits at 5-2 on the year and is 
ranked No. 7 in the national polls. 
It has a win over then-No. 2 Florida 
State and an overtime loss to No. 4 Stanford 
notched under its belt, not to mention a streak 
of six straight away games that comes to an end tonight in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
The Gators open their Southeastern Con-
ference schedule when they face the Crimson Tide (4-2-1) at 8 p.m. at the Alabama Soccer Stadium. This will be the second straight year that Florida and Alabama will be opening conference play against each other.
Coach Becky Burleigh said that conference 
play is far more different than facing non-conference opponents because teams like Ala-bama are so familiar with how Florida plays. 
There are no secrets.
“It’s just a whole different animal when it 
comes to SEC,” Burleigh said. “The rivalries 
and the familiarity make it a lot more per-
sonal.”When the Gators and the Crimson Tide 
met last season, Florida’s freshmen led the way to a 3-0 victory in Gainesville. 
But teams change every season, and Ala-
bama is looking to return the favor this year in Tuscaloosa.
Florida will be the second ranked oppo-
nent Alabama plays this season. The Tide fell 3-0 to then-No. 3 Virginia on Sept. 5.
“I really respect Alabama’s attack, I think 
they’ve got some really good personality players,” Burleigh said. “We’ll have our work cut out for us. We’ve lost there before, so it’s definitely something that we don’t take for granted, especially as an opener.”Florida opens SEC play against Alabama tonight

After ending last season on 
a bittersweet note, the Florida 
men’s tennis team is motivated to come back even stronger for this year’s campaign.
Florida’s 2014 season came to 
a heartbreaking end at the hands of heavy favorite Ohio State, los-ing 4-3 in a thrilling Round of 16 matchup in the NCAA Tourna-ment.
UF coach Bryan Shelton, en-
tering his third season at Florida, said he thinks the way the season 
ﬁ  nished is providing inspiration 
for the team.
“I think that was just some val-
idation for us that ‘hey, we’ve got-ten better,’” Shelton said, “but at the same time, it was a little bit of a sting because we were so close and we didn’t get the job done.
“It’s just like maybe if we hit a 
few more serves, or if we worked on the return a little bit more, or if we had done one more wind sprint, what’s the difference to get that one extra point that we need-ed, and so you use that as fuel to come back and continue to work 
hard so that the next time you’re 
in that situation, you execute.”
As a team captain and one of 
the returning players who wit-nessed the loss to Ohio State, ju-nior Gordon Watson echoed Shel-ton’s sentiments, saying although the loss hurt, good could come from it.
“It’s a great motivator for this 
year, to put in the extra work ev-eryday to get to that next level this year,” he said.
Richard Brej, Florida’s lone 
senior, said he believes the way the team played in that match last season helped unify the players, bringing them together like a fam-ily.
Speaking of family, Brej, Wat-
son and the rest of the Florida players also said they are look-ing forward to playing in front of their Gator family this weekend in 
the SEC Fall Classic, which begins 
today and is being hosted by UF.
“The fans are awesome, they 
always support us,” Watson said, “and the freshmen, it’s a good in-troduction for the spring…”
Added Shelton: “It’s pretty 
special. I always say it’s nice to be able to sleep in your own bed.
“Obviously, we’re comfortable 
on our courts, and get to play in front of family and friends and fans, that’s always fun for our guys and for us as coaches as well.”

After not performing up 
to the standards of a nation-
ally successful program, the 
Florida men’s golf team looks 
to bounce back after a discour-aging 13th-place ﬁ  nish in its ﬁ  rst tournament of the year as 
it heads to Zionsville, Ind., for 
the two-day Wolf Run Inter-collegiate. 
Coach J.C. Deacon made it 
a point to remind the players 
of how poorly they played in 
the opening tournament.
“I don’t 
think I let them 
move on, I re-
minded them 
of how we ﬁ  nished quite a few times,” Deacon said. “It has bothered them and I’ve let 
them know how much it both-
ered me, our result, and I’m really planning on seeing a different team this weekend.”
The team lineup has un-
dergone some changes for Zi-onsville. Freshman Ryan Cel-ano, who won the qualifying rounds for the tournament, 
will be making his collegiate 
debut on Saturday.
And Eric Banks, who was 
the 2014 recipient of the David Toms Award, will be making his senior year debut. Not be-ing able to help the team in the 
ﬁ  rst tournament is motivating 
Banks this weekend.
“It hurt a lot, just because 
I knew that I could contrib-ute to the team,” Banks said. “I would’ve obviously liked 
to play, I heard it was a great 
course, but I’m kind of look-ing forward to this one and getting the ball rolling.”
Deacon said the Wolf Run 
Golf Club is a long and hard golf course that presents a test for the team. 
“It’s a big boy golf course,” 
said sophomore Ryan Orr, who ﬁ  nished the ﬁ  rst tourna-ment at 12-over par. “It’s very long, so off the tee is going 
to be crucial because it looks 
like the rough is pretty long and if you start hitting it in the rough on longer holes off the tee, you might not even be 
able to hit the green.”
One of the other challenges 
which might present itself 
over the weekend in Zions-
ville is the potential for cooler 
weather. With nine out of the 10 players on the team from the state of Florida, Banks, who is from Truro, Canada, 
has been giving advice to the 
players on how to deal with the weather conditions.
Even with the disappoint-
ing ﬁ  nish at the Carpet Capital 
Collegiate Classic almost two 
weeks ago, Orr said the team 
has its eyes on the prize.
“Our expectation is to try 
to win this golf tournament,” 
he said. “I don’t know who’s 
playing in it, but I don’t think it really matters. I think we’re all capable and we’re all play-ing well, so I think we can win 
this thing.”Men’s golf team

The Sooners (-7.5) will take 
the win sooner rather than later 
because ...
Oklahoma’s offense has not 
had a hiccup thus far this year. 
The Sooners are averaging 44.7 
points per game, good for 16th in the nation, while limiting its ﬁ  rst three opponents to just 11. Expect 
Oklahoma’s trio of running backs 
— Keith Ford, Samaje Perine and 
Alex Ross — to have a ﬁ  eld day against WVU, which is giving up an average of 162.5 yards on the 
ground this season.

Now onto the Picks!
In ﬁ  rst place with a 14-9 re-
cord is alligatorSports staff writer 
Jonathan “bailing out” Czupryn, 
who decided to skip the alligator-Sports podcast this week in order to see a girl. Really, man? 
You picked a girl over sports? Was she at least better look-
ing than “most” of us like Kurt Roper’s wife?Dropping down one spot to 
second place with a 13-10 record is the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar 
“Free Falling” Thompson, who 
had an appalling 1-7 record in 
last week’s round of picks. 
I repeat, ONE and SEVEN. It’s 
ﬁ  ne Edgar. We get that you had a 
bad week. 
Everyone else sucked at least a 
little bit last week, too. Unfortu-
nately, you just sucked the most.
In third place with a 12-11 re-
cord is alligatorSports staff writer Morgan “drag racing” Moriarty, who received her ﬁ  rst speeding 
ticket on the way to this year’s 
Southeastern Conference Media 
Days while heading to Alabama in July. 
Good job, Morgan. Do you 
know you’re just adding on to 
the stereotype that women can’t 
drive?
Yes, I know you’re eager to 
see the Crimson Tide and your 
coach-crush in Nick Saban.
But let’s hope lightning doesn’t 
strike twice when you make your return to the Heart of Dixie.
Tied for fourth with an 11-12 
clip is alligatorSports.org Edi-tor Richard “The NFL sucks ass” Johnson, who has expressed his disdain for the National Football 
League on more occasions than 
one over the past two weeks. We 
wish we could understand your logic, bud. 
Football is football. It doesn’t matter if it’s profes-sional, college or peewee. The game is the same.
Embrace the NFL, Richard. 
Embrace it.
Also in fourth and just un-
der .500 is Gator Country’s Nick 
“mid-life crisis” de la Torre, who 
is starting to show his age  this 
week with an (un)impressive salt-and-pepper hairdo. 
There’s two simple solutions 
here, Nick: Just for Men or a vin-
tage Mustang. 
Hopefully you realize which is 
the right choice to go with. 
Rounding out the alligator-
Sports group in sixth place with a 
10-13 clip is editor Jordan “I want to build a snowman” McPherson, who mentioned on the alligator-Sports podcast on Tuesday how much he enjoyed the children’s movie “Frozen.” 
OK, Jordan. You can make up 
all the excuses you want about watching it with your little sis-ter. 
But you need to come to your 
senses and just admit it — you 
like the movie. It’s not a secret 
anymore.
Tied with Jordan in sixth place 
and four games out of the top spot is Inside the Gators’ Landon “against the grain” Watnick, who was the only person to pick North 
Carolina over East Carolina for 
this weekend’s matchups. 
I don’t know, man. Maybe 
watching football on three differ-
ent TVs in your Estates apartment room gave you some insight that we didn’t know about. 
Or maybe watching those 
three TVs simultaneously is mak-
ing you delusional. I think it’s 
safe to say that we’re going with 
the latter.
And once again in dead-ass-
last with a piss-poor record of 
9-14 is Thomas “Who dat?” Gold-
kamp, who wears some sort of New Orleans Saints apparel to a majority of the Florida football 
media availabilities. 
Come on, man! 
The Saints, with their incred-
ible 0-2 record, are probably the only team doing worse than you 
are right now. 
Maybe you should look into 
another team. 
I hear the Browns are doing 
pretty well right now, wouldn’t 
you say?

LW ‘Bama Miss. St. ClemOne weapon Florida has that Ala-
bama does not is Savannah Jordan, 
who scored twice against the Crim-son Tide last year. 
The sophomore leads the Gators 
with five goals this season and looks forward to continuing to contribute to the team, whether she’s scoring goals or not.
“I think they’ll (SEC opponents) 
be aware that I scored goals last year, but to me it’s not really my focus,” Jordan said. “I’m worried about helping our team win.”
Alabama has an offensive weap-
on of its own in senior midfielder Theresa Diederich, who has a team-best 12 points by scoring four goals and recording four assists. Alabama has scored 17 goals so far this season while Florida has scored 16.
One player who will be key for 
Florida tonight as she has been all 
season is senior Tessa Andujar. 
The San Clemente, Calif., native 
leads the Gators with four assists 
this year and was deemed “unstop-pable” by Burleigh in Florida’s game against Stanford for her ability to play balls in and create scoring op-portunities.
“I think we’re really excited to 
start SEC play,” Andujar said. “Ev-ery game is different and every year is different and everybody gives it all they’ve got, so I’m excited to see what Alabama has to bring.” 16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2014
� FLORIDA PLAYS MARQUETTE TONIGHT.

Ziva Recek has not seen much time on the court 
this season.
With a roster that holds four outside hitters, Florida 
is bound to have issues subbing in all of its players in 
one match.
Two of those four outside hitters making a big 
impact for Florida are Noami Santos-Lamb and Carli Snyder, who have become integral in Florida’s rotation and as a result has limited Recek’s time on the court.
While it may not be ideal for Recek, it does put into 
perspective the amount of depth this Florida squad has and it will be on display when No. 7 Florida (5-2) goes head-to-head in it’s two home matches for the weekend against Marquette (6-3) tonight and Central 
Florida (7-3) on Sunday.
In 2013, the Slovenian had a larger role on the team, 
ending the year as a “Volleyball Magazine’s” Third 
Team All American and ranking seventh in the South-eastern Conference in double-doubles.
But now she is sharing more of her time with San-
tos-Lamb and Snyder – both of whom are known for their strength behind the ball.
“We think the depth is one of the strengths of our 
team, to be able to use that,” coach Mary Wise said. “It would be nice if there were unlimited basketball substitutions of our game, but we are limited and as a matter of fact on Tuesday, I think the second set, we had run out. We think the depth, whether it’s Holly in the libero jersey or Taylor, that gives us different looks.”
Santos-Lamb is coming off of an ACL tear that oc-
curred during the 2013 preseason; however, when she 
returned a year later she only played in 16 matches 
and a total of 28 sets.
The Florida squad is now using Santos-Lamb for 
her ability to block and make fast, hard kills against her opponents. She has 54 kills so far this season.
On the other hand, Snyder, the 6 foot tall freshman, 
has been given significant time on the court.
Her ability to put power behind the ball with few 
errors has helped put her in the starting position for 
three of the seven games she’s played in.
Snyder has 54 kills in seven matches and 23 sets 
with only 19 errors on 133 attempts.
The Macomb, Mich., native was best known in 
high school for taking over games with her ability to 
both block and make efficient kills.Florida deep at outside hitter position
