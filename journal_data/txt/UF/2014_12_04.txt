Following a state federal appellate 
court decision Wednesday, same-sex cou-
ples could legally marry in Florida as soon 
as Jan. 5.
Florida’s same-sex marriage ban was 
originally overturned by U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle on Aug. 21. 
But he immediately put a hold on the 
ruling, effectively postponing same-sex 
marriage legalization in Florida until the 
U.S. Supreme Court considered and de-
cided on the case.
But when the Supreme Court failed to 
pick up the case by Oct. 6, a conditional 90-day countdown began, which kept Hin-kle’s hold in place until Jan. 5.
Despite Florida’s forthcoming legaliza-tion, Attorney General Pam Bondi fought to de-fend the ban. 
She asked the federal 
appellate court Florida falls under — the U.S. 
11th Circuit Court of Ap-
peals — to extend the 
hold, but on Wednesday, 
the court refused.
Unless the court decides to uphold the ban, same-sex couples will be able to marry when the countdown concludes this January.
UF alumna Sam Casanova, 21, said 
she is glad she may have the opportunity to marry a signiﬁ  cant other in her home state.
“As a queer woman, this means a lot 
to me,” she said. “I think people are just realizing that marriage should be open to everyone.”Fla. same-sex marriages could begin in January after appeal endsMELISSA MIHM

Brian Irizarry was spray-
ing lacquer on wooden cabi-
net doors before he saw the 
ﬂ  ames ignite.
“It went up like a ﬂ  ash 
ﬁ  re,” the 31-year-old said as he smoked a cigarette across 
the street from Mica-Mode 
Cabinetry.
“I started spraying water 
on that b***h,” he said to his 
coworker.
Cans of lacquer started 
popping and ﬂ  ying all over 
the room and out of the roof, 
he said. 
Irizarry tried to put the ﬁ  re 
out until another co-worker told him to get out.“I got out right before the 
explosion,” Irizarry said. “It 
was those 60 seconds.”

in ﬂ  ames at about 4 p.m. 
Wednesday. 
Seven minutes later, 
Gainesville Fire Rescue was 
on the scene. 
Three minutes after that

All workers were able to 
get out of the building un-scathed, and no ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters 
were injured while putting 
out the ﬂ  ames.

Although UF remained open Wednesday despite a 
threat to “shoot up the college,” many professors can-
celed class.
“Faculty members have been asked to work with stu-
dents who are concerned,” said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes. “Again, the risk is low.”
University Police sent out a UF alert early Wednesday 
morning regarding the threat, which UPD Captain Jeff Holcomb said ofﬁ  cers believed was a hoax.Identical messages were sent from 15 separate Twitter 
account holders from across the country and were all ad-
dressed to @GatorZoneNews. All tweets arrived around 
7 p.m. Tuesday.According to the alert, UPD believed the threat was 
low due to the general language. 
UPD is also aware of at least one other university that 
received a similar threat via social media, and it was later 
determined to be a hoax.
Holcomb said it’s a possibility that the accounts were 
hacked, and UPD is working with the FBI to ﬁ  nd those 
responsible.
As of Wednesday, Sikes said there was an increased 
police presence on campus.
Sikes said an email was sent as opposed to a text mes-
sage because there was no immediate threat.
“We had to send out a lot of information, and a text is 
not conducive to that,” Sikes said.UF sends alert after receiving shooting threats via social mediaCAMPUS

� IT WAS STUDENTS FOR A 
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
BRYAN FAUX
Alligator Contributing Writer
Tristan Worthington shout-
ed “Hey UF administration, 
money is for education” from a megaphone at a rally against police militarization on campus 
Wednesday afternoon.  
Worthington, a 19-year-old 
UF English sophomore, led the 
march with Students for a Demo-cratic Society from Turlington Plaza to Tigert Hall in protest of UF’s participation in the 1033 program.
The program provides free 
military grade weapons to local police departments.
“We don’t feel that military 
grade weapons and supplies should be provided to local and campus police departments in order to do their jobs,” said Wor-thington, a Students for a Demo-cratic Society lead organizer.
Three members of the orga-
nization entered Tigert Hall for a meeting with UF administra-
tion representatives, including 
University Police Chief Linda Stump.
About 20 minutes later, stu-
dents emerged and announced that Stump was willing to help the group convince the admin-istration to opt out of the 1033 program on the condition that 
the department could keep its ar-
mored rescue vehicle.
Among the student organi-
zation’s concerns are the lack of training for the weapons provid-ed by the program and the cost of having the weapons delivered to campus.
UF spokesperson Janine Sikes 
said the rescue vehicle is the only piece of equipment obtained by UF from the 1033 program.

WASHINGTON — The Justice 
Department will conduct a federal 
investigation into the chokehold death of an unarmed black man after a grand jury in New York 
City declined to indict the white 
police officer who applied the move, a department official said Wednesday.
The official said authorities 
will investigate the July 17 death of Eric Garner, 43, who was con-fronted by the officer on suspicion 
of selling loose, untaxed ciga-
rettes. A video shot by an onlook-er shows Garner telling officers to leave him alone as they tried to ar-rest him and one then responded by wrapping his arm around Gar-ner’s neck.
Earlier Wednesday, a New 
York grand jury chose not to in-
dict Officer Daniel Pantaleo. The 
grand jury could have considered multiple charges, from murder to a lesser offense such as reckless endangerment, but Staten Island 
District Attorney Daniel Donovan 
said jurors found “no reasonable cause” to bring charges.
The federal investigation will 
be similar to a separate investiga-tion already underway into the Aug. 9 shooting death in Fergu-son, Missouri, of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old. A 
county grand jury in that case de-
cided against indicting the white officer, Darren Wilson.
from about a mile away. 
Fire trucks lined the road as fire-
fighters weaved in and out of the 
building and in between cars.
Workers from Mica-Mode and 
the surrounding buildings stood and 
stared as the sky grew darker.
The source of the fire is un-
known and under investigation, said 
Gainesville Fire Rescue Assistant 
Chief JoAnne Rice. 
The Fire Marshal was called in to 
check it out.
There were 28 firefighters, three 
tower trucks, four engines and a handful of patrol cars on the scene 
— a majority of the department’s re-
sources.
Rice said the fire caused heavy 
flames and thick, billowing smoke. Some of the flames jumped to an-other building south of the cabinet 
business.
At about 10 p.m., Rice did not 
have an estimate on the cost of dam-ages.
Satchel’s Pizza tweeted out videos 
of the fire.
“My heart sinks when I see smoke 
like that,” the restaurant wrote, re-
membering the fire that temporarily 
closed down their business on Feb. 
28, 2012.
Brandon Turner, 29, was in the Mi-
ca-Mode building with Irizarry when the fire started. He was in the break 
room when he first saw smoke.
“People were yelling, ‘fire, fire!’” 
he said.
Turner grabbed a hose and tried 
to put it out.
“Nothing you can do,” he said as 
he watched the building where he worked burn.

Smoke from the construc-
tion project at the Reitz Union 
set off a fire alarm Wednesday 
morning that resulted in the 
building’s evacuation.
At about 10 a.m., dust and 
smoke formed when workers 
cut concrete on the fourth floor, 
setting off an alarm that alerted 
fire rescue and university police 
to the scene.
The building was evacuated 
for only a few minutes, said Ed-
die Daniels, executive director 
of the Reitz.
“It was a very minor issue, 
no danger whatsoever,” he said. “It was absolutely in no 
way connected with the threats 
the university received.”
Still, students at the Reitz were questioning if the fire 
alarm was related to tweets 
posted early Wednesday morn-ing threatening a shooting at UF.
Julissa Aquino, a UF civil 
engineering sophomore, was studying on the second floor when the alarm sounded.
An announcement over the 
PA system then told students there was a reported emergency and to evacuate the building.
That’s when the shooting 
threat popped into Aquino’s mind.
“I was already paranoid 
going to school, but when you heard the alarm, that’s the first thing you think of,” the 19-year-old said. “I was scared.”
But when students exited 
the building calmly, her fears subsided.
“I was relieved to know that 
it was not something serious and that no one was hurt,” she said.Students evacuated

Student senators at Santa Fe College failed to address 
a resolution that could have led to Senate President Jer-
emy Pierce’s impeachment Wednesday.
This is the second time the resolution has been post-
poned, as senators were unable to vote on Pierce’s possi-ble impeachment Nov. 19 because there weren’t enough senators left to vote at the tail end of the nearly four-hour session.
The Student Senate also failed to address an amend-
ment that would have allowed the college’s administra-tion to remove Student Government members without trial during Wednesday’s meeting, as again there were not enough senators left in the session to vote when the agenda reached the amendment.
The motion to postpone the impeachment was made 
by 19-year-old Sen. Connor Levine who wished to give 
senators more time to prepare for their upcoming finals. 
The motion passed 20 to 19.
The resolution will instead be addressed in Senate 
during Spring semester because Wednesday marked the final Fall meeting.
If senators choose to impeach Pierce — who faces for-
mal complaints from senators who said he threatened them — he will still stand trial before he is removed from office, said Student Government Chief Justice Kyle 
Ramirez.
“These allegations — they’re not fully proven,” 
Ramirez said. Impeachment resolution postponed� IT’S THIS FRIDAY.

UF will honor the legacy of the 
late South Africa President and 
philanthropist Nelson Mandela 
this Friday.
The ceremony falls on the first 
anniversary of Mandela’s death. 
At the ceremony, faculty and staff will speak about Mandela’s life in the Ocora Room in Pugh Hall at noon. A tree planting will follow the ceremony in front of Grinter 
Hall.
The event is being sponsored 
by the Center for African Stud-
ies, the Bob Graham Center for 
Public Policy, the Samuel Proctor 
History Program, the African-American Studies Program, the Levin College of Law Center for Race and Race Relations and the African Student 
Union.
Agnes Leslie, 
outreach direc-
tor for the Cen-
ter for African Studies, said Mandela signifi-
cantly impacted 
everyone from students to aca-
demia.
“He stressed the value of edu-
cation. He believed education was the most powerful weapon to change the world,” Leslie said. “Students engage with that belief to this day.”
Faculty and students will rem-
inisce about Mandela’s legacy during the ceremony.
Mandisa Haarhoff, a 27-year-
old UF English literature doctoral student, will speak at the ceremo-ny about how Mandela impacted her life and the local community.
“I was born as a born-free South African. Growing up, Man-dela’s name became recognizable as a name that brought change and all these wonderful things,” 
Haarhoff said. “Sharing my story 
as a pupil will be very useful to fellow students. They can ap-ply Mandela’s principles to their 
own lives.”
The ceremony is open to all 
students, faculty and the general 
public.

Laura Sandoval anxiously waited by her laptop 
until she ﬁ  nally received the email that decided 
her college fate.
She burst with excitement and tears as she read 
her acceptance letter from UF in 2011.
Now a UF marketing senior, Sandoval has one 
worry on her mind: student debt.
And she’s not alone.About 77 percent of former college students 40 
and younger regret not managing their student loan debt better, according to a new study by Citi-zens Financial Group.
“I’m a very ﬁ  scally responsible person,” San-
doval, 21, said. “I just had originally intended to survive college without taking out loans, so sur-rendering that goal was hard to come to terms with.”
In statistics from this year, the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York found that Americans owe $1.1 trillion in student loan debt. And according to the Citizens Financial Group’s survey, the average student in the U.S. carries about $25,000 in student debt.
But at UF, about two-thirds of graduates leave 
with no student loan debt. Of those who do take out loans, they carry about $20,700 in debt.
UF alumna Christina Lamb, who is the senior associate director at the Ofﬁ  ce for Student Finan-cial Affairs, said, “The aid I received as a student made it possible for me to get my education at UF.”
Former students weren’t the only group sur-
veyed by Citizens Financial Group. More than 80 percent of current students said they wish they knew more about debt’s long-term impact.
“If a student needs additional funds to cover 
the cost of attendance,” Lamb said, “we encourage students to consider federal student loans ﬁ  rst.”
At UF, there are also other resources outside 
of the ﬁ  nancial ofﬁ  ce to learn about the impact of debt. Michael Gutter oversees UF’s Personal and Family Financial Planning certiﬁ  cate program in the family, youth and community sciences de-partment, which teaches students about personal ﬁ  nance.
“If you’re borrowing to go to college, you’re in-
vesting in yourself,” said Gutter, UF associate pro-fessor and family ﬁ  nancial management specialist. “Work hard and study hard to make a good return in your investment.”
The Citizens survey also found that about 90 
percent of current students think taking out loans will be worth the investment, while only about two-thirds of former students agreed.
Being in debt could keep students from buying 
their ﬁ  rst house, a car or even getting a job.
“We don’t want members of The Gator Nation 
showing up to an interview with amazing skills and not getting their dream job,” Gutter said. “An employer looking at your bad credit report could do that to you.”Students struggle with loans, debt

A team of UF researchers may have discov-
ered a biological control for a disease threaten-
ing Florida’s booming avocado industry.
The disease, laurel wilt, is caused by a bee-
tle that infects avocado trees with a fungus that 
inhibits the tree’s water absorption and causes 
them to die. The study was conducted on the red ambrosia beetle that was found in Georgia in 2002 and in South Florida in 2010. The team ﬁ  rst exposed the beetles to three commercially available fungi, according to a press release. All those beetles died.
The team then sprayed the fungi on the 
trunks of avocado trees. While ﬁ  nding their 
way into the tree trunk, the beetles got infect-
ed, and about 75 percent of them died.
Edward Evans, a UF associate professor of food and resource economics, said the red ambrosia beetle is not the only beetle causing laurel wilt.
“What we have is that it appears there are 
other ambrosia beetles that are also transmit-
ting the disease,” he said. These beetles, Evans 
said, are tiny, making it difﬁ  cult for scientists to know when to spray them.
To prevent these beetles from ever spread-
ing the disease to the trees, the team is look-ing to spray the avocado tree with the fungi as a preemptive measure. The team used an integrated pest management approach, which combines biological controls with forms of chemical controls to better protect the tree from the disease.
“If effective and practical, using biological 
agents is preferable option over using pes-ticides,” said UF plant science senior Daniel Greenwell, 24.UF researchers have found secret ingredient to saving avocadosCAMPUSReader response

Ferguson unrest underscores progress
Holidays are treasured in part because they are times, 
sanctioned by God or the government, for us to re-unite with distant and not-so-distant relatives. Un-
fortunately, this aspect can also make them nerve-racking and awful. You don’t get to pick and choose who your fam-
ily members are, and the same applies to your family mem-
bers’ political leanings.
In a political climate as heavily charged and polarized 
as ours was last week, things could have gotten truly ugly around the dinner table. If you somehow managed to nar-rowly avoid perils like Bill Cosby, the Israeli-Palestinian con-ﬂ  ict and the midterm elections discussions at Thanksgiving, more power to you. But looming more pregnant with hostil-ity and pain than any of these was the grand jury decision 
and ensuing unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. This is our taste of 
the racial and ethnic tensions that have been angrily tearing apart communities and countries across the world. Syria’s partisan civil war, Ukraine’s partition and Israel’s unsettling slide into charismatic nationalism are symptoms of a global heightening of tensions along colonialism’s fault lines.
Out of Michael Brown’s death erupted the most intense 
chapter of this centuries-old conﬂ  ict since Rodney King. It’s something kitchen debates won’t ever be able to solve; this 
is something tied to the birth of our nation, and must be re-
solved by the nation as a whole.
Ferguson is about Brown’s death, but it’s also about much 
more than that: The incident inherently carries such heavy consequences for race relations that even if we ever ﬁ  nd out what actually happened that day, not much will change.
Unquestionably, this is about race. But more broadly, it’s 
prompting a nationwide discussion — to put it very, very lightly — of what sort of country we’d like America to be. It’s 
the subtext which makes Ferguson polarizing in the way few 
events are. It’s not a rational debate on whether the shooting was legally murder. It’s a signal of allegiance to fundamen-tally different sets of ideals.
This was something that was bound to happen, if not in 
Ferguson, then in one of the thousands of other communities like it. A horriﬁ  c example is the death of Tamir Rice, whose shooting was caught on security footage. Responding to a call concerning an armed man in a park, an ofﬁ  cer shot Rice seconds after exiting his patrol car. The boy was 12 years old. The weapon was a BB gun. The fact that events like 
these seem nearly routine demon-
strates the need for change. The system clearly isn’t working prop-erly.
Unfortunately, plenty of people 
think it’s working just ﬁ  ne, hence the conﬂ  ict. Some people are anguished and outraged that a shooting death didn’t go to trial. Others are upset because of a minor theft.
And, unfortunately, the fact that some have taken ad-
vantage of the unrest to loot stores and damage property has been used to delegitimize the protests. These incidents have distracted from the real issues and resulted in a false portrayal of the people of Ferguson as violent and unwilling to respect the rule of law.
Instead of simply condemning the looting and dismiss-
ing the protesters, we should focus on why there is so much distress and help ﬁ  nd constructive solutions.
Already, the national conversation is shifting toward 
police reform, including broad proposals for all ofﬁ  cers to wear body cameras so they will behave in a way that truly upholds the law. 
Then again, a grand jury in New York City decided 
Wednesday not to indict the ofﬁ  cer responsible for the death of Eric Garner, whose fatal heart attack was caused by the of-ﬁ  cer’s use of a chokehold banned by the NYPD. A bystander recorded the entire encounter, which as of last night had 790,896 views on YouTube. This incident demonstrates that 
the body camera proposal, though a welcome step forward, 
will not be enough by itself.
Hopefully unrest in Ferguson will prompt the institution-
al and societal changes needed to lead us to solutions that prevent having these difﬁ  cult and painful conversations in the future.

your family booked hotel rooms for graduation yet?Today’s question: Do you feel safe on campus?Yoho ‘disapproval’ 
bill impedes real 
immigration strides
Republicans around the country were livid when President 
Barack Obama announced a plan to greatly reduce the likelihood of deportation for about 4.4 million undocu-
mented immigrants late last month.
Congressional Republicans have ideas to counter Obama’s 
plan: Filing lawsuits, shutting down the government (again) and defunding immigration agencies have all been discussed.
However, in recent days, the GOP has coalesced around a 
“symbolic measure of disapproval” proposed by Gainesville’s own Rep. Ted Yoho. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Yoho’s proposal “effectively says Obama does not have authority to give protected status to millions of illegal immigrants.”
“Allowing amnesty to illegal immigrants is an insult to the 
millions of Americans who stood in line and came to this coun-
try legally,” he wrote in a letter to his constituents this summer.
Yoho must not have been paying much attention during the 
Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. Both 
Republican presidents enacted executive orders providing de-portation relief that closely resembled Obama’s plan, albeit on a smaller scale. More importantly, Yoho’s “symbolic” bill rep-resents yet another attempt by Republicans to avoid taking any substantive action on immigration.
House Republicans have had four years to pass an immigra-
tion reform bill. Instead, they have spent those four years failing to enact any meaningful legislation, choosing instead to criticize the president for “poisoning the well” with his executive ac-tions. It is certainly true that Obama’s executive action was not the most ideal way to address immigration issues in America. Although most Americans approve of Obama’s immigration policy — a CNN poll found that 50 percent of Americans said that Obama’s proposal was “about right” — 56 percent opposed Obama taking such action unilaterally.
Ideally, the president and Congress would work together to 
address the issue of immigration reform in a constructive and re-sponsible manner. However, the president has faced a Congress unwilling to cooperate with him on this issue or any other. Re-publicans would rather motivate their political base by accusing the president of lawlessness and passing meaningless, symbolic bills than actually make progress on immigration reform.
Faced with this unprecedented level of obstruction from 
Congress, Obama had no choice but to act on his own. Hope-
fully, when Republicans take full control of Congress in Janu-
ary, they will shift course from their current obstructionism to a more constructive and responsible path. Even if they fail to appreciate the importance of immigration reform for America’s future, perhaps the GOP will acknowledge the need for support from Hispanic voters to ensure its long-term political survival.
However, it is more likely that Republicans will continue to 
oppose the president at every turn for the sake of short-term po-litical gain. If that comes to pass, the president should continue 
to take appropriate, lawful actions on the issue of immigration 
just as he did last week.THURSDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2014

Students and locals will come 
together this weekend to put on 
UF’s 65th annual holiday con-cert.
Sounds of the Season, hosted 
by the College of the Arts and the School of Music, will be at the Phillips Center for the Per-forming Arts on Sunday. The free concert starts at 7 p.m., and ticket distribution begins at 6 p.m. at the box ofﬁ  ce.
“For the past couple of years 
the Phillips Center has been so full that we have had to turn peo-ple away,” said Will Kesling, the conductor for the last 12 years. 
He said some people get to the 
box ofﬁ  ce before 6 p.m. because the show tends to ﬁ  ll quickly.
The concert coincides with 
Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day and will pay tribute with perfor-mances like variations of “Jingle Bell Rock” from Bing Crosby’s 1944 radio show that was broad-cast to the those ﬁ  ghting in the war at the time.
Some of the pieces the orches-
tra will be performing include Ir-ving Berlin’s “White Christmas” and a version of “Silent Night, Holy Night,” originally narrated by Walter Cronkite.
“Silent Night, Holy Night” is 
the story of the Christmas Truce of 1914 and is in remembrance of the day both sides put away their weapons and celebrated Christ-mas.
“Every time I talk about this 
moment I get goose bumps,” Kes-ling said. “It is so unbelievably moving.”
Kelsing said there will be 300-
plus performers on stage. One hundred of them are part of the orchestra, and 180 are part of the choir.
The concert is heavily support-
ed by President Bernie Machen and ﬁ  rst lady Chris Machen. Jen 
Day Shaw, associate vice presi-
dent of student affairs and dean 
of students, wrote in an email that President Machen’s involvement and introduction to the show last 
year was entertaining.
“This event is one of the many 
ways to enjoy Gainesville’s talent 
in celebration of the holiday sea-son,” she said.

Students and Gainesville resi-
dents will have the opportunity to 
ring in the holiday season by hear-
ing a unique take on Christmas clas-
sics.
The Mediaeval Baebes, a Brit-
ish septet known for its medieval-
style music, will be performing in 
Gainesville for the ﬁ  rst time at the University Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. Friday.
“Gainesville’s full of young 
people,” said Caroline Heaney, the Baebes’ tour publicist. “It’s a young college town, and that’s part of the audience we want to reach.”
The group is touring to celebrate 
the American release of its holiday album, “Of Kings & Angels,” which came out Oct. 14.
The concert will consist of popu-
lar Christmas tunes like “The Holly and the Ivy,” “Ding Dong Merrily 
on High,” “Away in a Manger” and 
“Silent Night,” all of which are fea-tured on the album.
Many of the 
arrangements of 
these classics were 
written by the Bae-bes’ founder, Kath-arine Blake, and 
will take listeners 
back in time, Heaney said.
“They’re arrangements that you 
won’t hear anywhere else,” Heaney 
said.
Amy Douglas, the director of 
marketing and communications for UF Performing Arts, said the con-cert will be nontraditional in terms 
of what people think of Christmas.
“You go to the mall and you hear 
Mannheim Steamroller,” Douglas 
said, talking about the American 
musical group that is known for its 
blend of classical music and rock in modern renditions of classic Christ-
mas songs. “These songs will be a 
lot of the songs that people already know, but they’ll be unique arrange-ments that people haven’t heard.” 
The arrangements are different 
in part because of the incorporation of medieval instruments, Heaney said. Some of these instruments are played by the singers and include 
the viola da gamba (the cello’s pre-
decessor), ancient lyres and hand saws.
Douglas said so far she expects 
an audience of about 400 people at the concert.
“It’s why we have the program,” 
she said. “We want students to be exposed to the many different per-
forming arts genres that are out 
there.”
UF student tickets are $10, and 
general admission costs between $20 
and $35 depending on the section. 
Tickets can be purchased at per-
formingarts.uﬂ  .edu or from the

The sharing of recipes is not 
only through cookbooks, television 
and the web but also on the radio. Contemporary radio shows, such as American Public Media’s “The 
Splendid Table” hosted by Lynne 
Rossetto Kasper, have been con-tinuing the art of recipe telling on the airwaves since the early 20th century. In fact, the glory days of radio homemaking began in the 1920s, increased in popularity dur-ing the Depression years and lasted up until the 1960s when television 
took the scene. Providing a com-
munity for the radio homemaker were women such as Evelyn Corrie Birkby, of Sidney, Iowa, who chat-ted about domestic life, sharing best recipes and cooking tricks.The success of a radio 
show largely rests in the art of telling stories and, for a show about food, the art of telling recipes. The nature of the radio show, in which the listener can’t glance 
back and read the ingredi-
ent list or measurement amounts, must take into account its live for-mat and provide additional narra-tive features, such as more descrip-tions and repetitions.
Harvey Steiman, host of food 
talk shows in San Francisco, lists key factors for a successful radio 
recipe.
*Start by describing the ﬁ  nished 
dish — its appearance, texture and  
ﬂ  avors. Tell a story about the dish or how you arrived at the recipe — anything to give a reason to keep listening.*Repeat the ingredients 
and the amounts.
*Fill the time between 
ingredients with speciﬁ  ca-tions about it (instead of just saying “two pears,” add “I like to use Bosc pears be-
cause the crisp texture lets 
them cook longer and absorb more 
ﬂ  avor”).
*Keep the ingredients to six or 
fewer or group into smaller clus-ters.
*Use normal English.*Describe the look, feel and 
taste (this helps listeners visual-
ize what’s happening as the recipe 
takes shape).
*Repeat the amounts as you 
mention each ingredient in the pro-cess.
*Finish by suggesting an appro-
priate presentation or accompani-ment.
*Try to sound as though you’re 
engaged in the process of cooking, not just reading a recipe.
Additional advice to the radio 
host is to remember that with the ra-dio, you’re competing for the listen-
ers’ attention as they are likely to be 
doing other things at the same time (driving, jogging, walking, etc). The radio cannot depend on its audi-ence giving the show their undivid-ed attention because the radio is of-ten just playing in the background. The listener will not be able to write down the recipe, so let them know 
how they can get the recipe (online, 
mail in, etc.). While you may not tell a recipe on the radio, you surely will sometime to your friends or family. Knowing how the pros tell a recipe will surely make you into a great recipe teller.

“The Nightmare Before Christmas”
Tim Burton’s musical stop-motion ﬁ  lm follows 
Jack Skellington, who opens a portal from Hal-loween Town to Christmas Town. He becomes intrigued by what he ﬁ  nds and decides to cel-
ebrate this new-to-him holiday.
“Love Actually”
This holiday rom-com depicts 10 love stories 
and the various facets of love in a countdown to Christmas.
“Christmas with the Kranks”
This comedy starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee 
Curtis tells the story of a couple’s choice to not 
celebrate Christmas while their daughter is in Peru with the Peace Corps and instead take a 
cruise to the Bahamas. This makes them out-casts among their neighbors, but when their daughter makes a surprise visit home, the couple scrambles to host a traditional Christ-
mas celebration.
“Bad Santa”  
A true holiday comedy, this movie features Billy 
Bob Thornton and Bernie Mac as thieves who disguise themselves as Santa and his helper in order to access malls to rob them. A naive kid thinks Thornton’s character really is Santa, and the movie follows the impact this kid has on the con men. MICAH JAMESON

Catch a break from studying 
during ﬁ  nals week and get your 
funk (and reggae, and rock, and a little bit of dance) on with lo-cal groups that promise a good 
time.
The eclectic, multi-genre, co-
ed band Melting Funk Pot head-
lines at The Atlantic on Dec. 12 with local groups Captain Love-ly and Locochino.
Melting Funk Pot guitarist 
Benoit Ksstentini and the large collective of nine musicians will stay true to their name during the show, playing a mix of styles from funk to reggae with even a little bit of rap.
The band’s name is honest: In 
their early 20s to 40s, members come from all over the world, 
from France to Morocco.
Though eclectic, the band 
stays uniﬁ  ed with matching out-
ﬁ  ts and tightly written songs. Those seemingly accidental slips into different genres mid-song are all just part of the act.
The members’ quick wit and 
overwhelming stage presence 
are sure to make the evening dif-ferent from any other, especially 
due to the other bands’ distinct styles. Captain Lovely’s synth dance beats over a rock tone will complement Melting Funk Pot, while Locochino’s alt-rock riffs will give a powerful contrast.
With a mix of characters and 
an array of genres, Melting Funk Pot also plans to shy away from music alone. Ksstentini said a sense of humor and even some choreography are in store.
Be sure to catch this show as 
it promises to be a one-of-a-kind experience. Doors open at 9 p.m., 
and there is a $6 cover.Mixed-genre band Melting Funk Pot

The aroma of boiling molasses, 
the dust of corn shucking and the 
twanging sounds of banjos will ﬁ  ll Dudley Farm Historic State Park’s 
biggest event of the year Saturday.
Visitors to the park can get a 
whiff of rich Florida farm life from 
the time periods following the Civ-il War up through the mid-1940s 
at the 25th annual Cane Day. The 
free event is at the farm located at 
18730 W. Newberry Road from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
More than 40 volunteers 
equipped with roles throughout 
the farm, house and commissary 
store will be clothed in traditional garb and living history at one of Alachua County’s oldest farms.
“It’s a dying art — a lot of the 
stuff that’s done here — hardly anybody sees it anymore,” said Sandra Cashes, the farm’s park services specialist. “So just being 
able to give that educational value 
to people and show them what our 
forefathers used to do is the best part of the event.”
Cashes has organized the event 
for the past three years and said she loves watching the actors at 
the old farmstead breathe history 
into guests with remnants of the 
old South.
She expects more than 2,000 
people to come explore the ven-
dors and participate in old-time 
crafts like butter churning, quilt-
drawing and grinding sugar cane, 
which will be taught by volun-teers.
Newberry resident Gloria 
Hughes started volunteering at 
the event in 1996 and said she has 
watched the popular festival blos-som into “something remarkable.”
“We have to know our past,” 
she said. “We really do, and cher-
ish that.”
Hughes will be the commissary 
keeper, joining other volunteers 
who will be nurturing the live-
stock, cooking in the kitchen and 
even sitting on the house’s porch.
The actors donate their time be-
cause of their appreciation of the 
park and dedication to educating others, she said.
As guests walk through the 
park, the actors will share facts and 
stories about the farm that once be-
longed to Myrtle Dudley.
Dudley, whose birthday is com-
memorated through the festival, 
donated her family’s farm to the state in 1983, hoping to preserve its 
history for generations to come.
She documented the estate’s 
precious artifacts with lively sto-
ries bursting with Florida’s deep-rooted farmstead culture.
The event’s proceeds will go to 
Friends of Dudley Farm, the group  
that safeguards her family’s lega-
cy.
Alachua County resident Art 
Wade, who is president of the or-ganization, said the event offers an 
authentic experience of old farm 
life, reminding some guests of their past and others of an era they 
never had the chance to see.
“It’s kind of an eye-opening ex-
perience if they look at it as that’s 
just one thing our ancestors had to do each year to just make ends 
meet, in order to eat,” Wade said.The activities will show what 
life was like in the fall more than 
100 years ago, he said.
Park admission will be $8 per 
vehicle with up to eight occupants.“People come out to see how 
things were done years ago,” Hughes said. “Stepping back in time like that gives them an entirely 
different outlook.”

When cold cases get hot on the Internet: The deal with “Serial”
If you haven’t heard of the 
podcast Serial yet, you 
might be living under a rock or lost somewhere in Leakin Park searching through the mysteries of the death of Hae Min Lee.
Wait, I’ll get back to that at a 
later time, I promise.
Serial, a spinoff of NPR’s “This 
American Life” and hosted by Sarah Koenig, is a podcast where Koenig delves into the 2000 conviction of Adnan Syed for the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, week by week. Koenig’s telling of the Baltimore-area crime has reached listeners in a way unprecedented for podcasts, and theories to what truly hap-pened on that afternoon in January 1999 have produced intense online discussion and even spinoff podcasts.Here are some of our own theories:
From our online managing 
editor, Bakr Saliq:
When I started listening to 
Serial, I was in the “Adnan’s in-
nocent” camp. By the middle of Serial, I was in the “I-don’t-know-what-to-believe” camp. As of this week, I’m pretty sure that maybe I’m certain that Adnan did prob-ably most likely do it. Maybe.
This darned podcast has 
turned me into a wannabe detec-tive, looking and relooking at all the evidence presented,  scour-ing the Internet for extra sources, theories and opinions, and turning nearly every conversation I have into Serial debates. My conclusion is still I’m pretty sure that maybe Adnan probably most likely could have done it. Maybe.From our editor, Kristan Wiggins
Do I think I know who did it? 
Nope. Do I believe someone for sure 
didn’t do it? I don’t know that either. That’s been my feeling from the get-go with this fuel-for-obssesive-ten-dencies story. From the beginning, others would say I’m pro-Adnan. Sure there are episodes that made me think he’s innocent and then ones that make me think guilty. But the latest episodes have only con-ﬁ  rmed my doubts (especially when Koenig got the Best Buy call (con-ﬁ  rming she doesn’t have a planned ending for this whole thing) and the Innocence Project’s involvement). So, I’m on the side of “Adnan’s case is on shaky ground, so no one has a valid reason to believe one way or the other (besides to hate Jay.).” From our basketball writer, Erica Hernandez:
Having delved into the rabbit hole that is the Internet, I offer you now my top theories. Note 
that I’m assuming you are caught up on Serial because that’s Koenig’s job, not mine.
Theory 1: We can all agree that Jay knows way too much to not be involved. As we learned 
in the disappointing “The Deal with Jay” episode, Jay is a hustler. He’s smart — Smart enough 
to commit a crime and frame someone else. Jay and Jen knew Hae was dead and buried for six weeks before they spoke with police. If they are as innocent as they claim to be, that is a huge red ﬂ  ag. What if Jay was “stepping out” on his beloved girlfriend Stephanie with Jen? What if Adnan was the only person who knew, and he told Stephanie’s friend/his ex-girlfriend Hae? That would give Jay a motive to kill or silence Hae and seek revenge on Adnan by framing him. It makes a whole lot of sense. Almost too much sense.
Theory 2: The lack of physical evidence in the case is what many fans cling to, and it’s a 
strong defense for Adnan. Besides lacking a motive, Adnan was never physically linked to the crime. The prosecution’s case was based solely on Jay’s ever-changing testimonies, so this be-
comes messy.
What if a serial killer murdered Hae? Like a man who committed suicide in Baltimore County 
jail when he was connected via DNA to other rapes and murders of Asian women shortly after 
Hae’s death. Another alternative redditers cling to is convicted murderer Roy S. Davis, who was 
convicted for the rape and murder of a girl from Hae’s school in 2004. Both alternate suspects 
killed their victims by strangulation, like Hae’s murderer. Let that sink in. What if Jay turns out 
the serial killer, guilty of Hae’s murder and others? We shall see.
As the ﬁ  rst season of Serial is winding down, we can’t help but wonder: Is Adnan truly guilty? Why are there so many inconsistencies in Jay’s multiple       
stories? What is the deal with the Nisha call? If you have any theories to answer these questions, tweet us: #theAvenue @TheAlligator BUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

The day hasn’t come just yet.
Negotiations between UF ath-
letics director Jeremy Foley and Colorado State head coach Jim McElwain are still ongoing, even 
though signs have pointed to a 
deal being reached.
Kelly Lyell of the Coloradoan 
reported Wednesday that buyout negotiations are one of the final steps holding back the signing.
Edgar Thompson of the Or-
lando Sentinel confirmed later Wednesday afternoon that the 
contract deal has been stalled be-
cause of buyout negotiations.
McElwain has a $7.5 million 
buyout in his contract with Colo-rado State, a buyout amount Col-orado State is firm on holding, ac-
cording to the Coloradoan.
If Foley were to hire McElwain 
and have to pay the buyout, it would be in addition to the near-
ly $8 million UF will have to pay to former head coach Will Mus-
champ and the rest of his coach-
ing staff.
Muschamp will receive ap-proximately $2 million a year through the duration of his con-tract, which expires in 2017.
The remainder of the coaching 
staff would receive a combined total of about $2 million if they 
are not retained for the 2015 sea-
son.
The 62-year-old athletics direc-
tor as well as at least three other University Athletic Association members traveled from Jackson-
ville to Fort Collins, Colorado, on 
Tuesday.
The group met with McElwain 
to discuss the potential head coaching job.
After spending the night just 
outside Fort Collins on Tues-day in an attempt to hire the next head coach for the Florida 
football team, Foley returned to 
Gainesville on Wednesday via charter jet at 5:33 p.m.
McElwain was not on board.The University Athletic As-
sociation sent out a statement 
through one of its Twitter ac-
counts (@GatorZoneFB) at 2:29 
p.m. and said both sides are still 
involved in the discussion.
“We’ve had very produc-tive conversations with Coach McElwain and his wife Karen,” the tweet read, “and those con-
tinue.”Foley gave no further update 
after getting off the plane.
“We gave you what we gave 
you,” Foley said. “That’s the end of the conversation. Nothing else 
to report.
“We had a great conversation. 
We’re not there yet.”

IAN COHEN
Alligator Writer @icohenb
There was a moment in coach Mary Wise’s 
press conference on Monday that may go un-
noticed, but shouldn’t.
The topic was then-No. 6 Florida’s 3-2 
road victory over then-No. 3 Texas two days 
earlier, a match where the Gators proved to 
anyone watching, and to themselves, that they are a team to be feared in the upcoming NCAA tournament.
“Even if we had come out on the other side 
and lost,” Wise said, “I would’ve felt equally as good.”
Then, she hesitated.
“Ok. Maybe not 
quite as equally.”
There is no time 
for feeling good after 
a loss in late November.
That feeling is reserved for moments like 
in the first week of September, when Wise’s still improving team fell to then-No. 8 FSU on the road and then to the same No. 3 Texas team at home two days later.
But Saturday was not like that first week 
in September, when Wise and the Gators still felt good even in defeat, because they recog-nized that they were only five matches deep into a 28-match journey.
Saturday was not like 
September, because a 3-2 loss at No. 3 Texas on Saturday, although com-mendable, would have fallen short of UF’s expec-tations.
But Florida won, and 
with it came a No. 8 seed 
in the NCAA tournament 
and home field advantage in the first two 
rounds. ESPN volleyball analyst Maria Tay-lor even declared Florida her sleeper pick in the tournament.
She’s wrong.Florida should be a favorite, but its seed-
ing suggests otherwise.
After upsetting Texas, Wise assumed that 
Florida would receive a higher seed than 
what they were given.
“We thought going into (Texas)… that 
Texas was the No. 2 seed, and Florida was go-
ing to be the No. 8 seed,” Wise said. “After UF ready for NCAA Tourney

ERICA A. HERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer @EricaAlyssa
After Florida’s (3-3) loss against 
Miami by just two points on Nov. 17, 
coach Billy Donovan knew he had to find a way to help starting point guard Kasey Hill.
“He’s got to make better decisions 
and better choices,” Donovan said af-ter the game.
In the game against the Hurricanes, 
the sophomore’s struggles on the court officially began. 
He made one of nine field goals and 
missed the only three-point shot he took in the 33 minutes he played.
Things got worse for Hill in Flor-ida’s next game against Louisiana-Monroe on Nov. 21. 
Though Florida managed a 61-56 
overtime win against the Warhawks, 
Hill was 2-of-12 from the field and he 
again missed the only three-point shot he took in 37 minutes.
In Florida’s first three games of the 
season, Hill was 3 for 24 from the field and 0 of 2 in three-pointers. 
“I think he’s got to finish a lot bet-
ter, especially at the basket,” Donovan 
said before the team left to the Baha-
mas. 
“In practice and in individual work-
outs, he can make 15-, 17-foot jump shots. He has proven to be able to do 
that, and he’s able to prove he can fin-
ish in the lane, but he’s got to be a bet-ter finisher when he gets in there. He’s 
had some drives where he has gotten Hill improving in 2nd year

be able to make those plays. He’s got to be able to put the ball in the basket.”
At the start of the season, 
Donovan praised Hill for his in-creased focus from freshman to sophomore year. 
Having taken a back seat to 
Florida’s four seniors, the young 
point guard had some strides to 
make up for a team lacking estab-lished leadership.
“I thought a lot of times his ef-
fort and his energy was really up 
and down and he’s such a great 
kid and he’s so laid back some-times, it’s not a good disposition as a 6-foot-1 point guard,” Dono-
van said. 
“And I would say that since 
we’ve practiced, I have not seen 
any of that.”
Hill managed a .407 field goal 
percentage in 32 games played in 
the 2013-14 season. 
He ended the season ranked 
fourth in the Southeastern Con-
ference in assist-to-turnover ratio 
(2.0).
On the flip side of the Gators’ 
Bahamas trip, the team returned 
defeated.
But Hill found his fix.
“I was really, at least coming 
out of the Bahamas, really proud 
of him for a couple of reasons,” Donovan said on Wednesday. “I really was impressed with 
the way he battled, the way he 
thought. There was some things 
he learned through those games of how people were defending him and how he could kind of play better and utilize the way he was being defended and I think he’s done a much, much better job of that. 
“I was really proud of his 
fight, his competitiveness in those games. I thought he from a resiliency and a toughness stand-point really grew up in a lot of ways there.”
In the Bahamas, Hill shot 11 of 
26 from the field and 1 of 2 from 3-point range.
A chipper, easy-go-lucky Hill 
met with media on Wednesday — his 21st birthday.
His first comment was that no, 
he had not received the 21 punch-es teammate Michael Frazier was planning on giving him.
Where once silence filled the void of Hill’s waning confidence, 
the Florida native now turned to 
honesty.
“Coach told me the truth that I 
was playing terrible and I wanted 
to play as good as I could and I listened to him,” Hill said. 
“It’s the truth, I mean I like 
hearing the truth and coach Don-ovan’s always tells you the truth so you’ve gotta be a man and re-spond.”
Though he hadn’t yet reached 
his milestone 21st birthday while competing in the Bahamas, Hill responded and manned up.
Hill’s best performance so far 
this season came in the Gators’ last game on Paradise Island. 
He scored a career-high 20 
points and was 10 of 12 from the 
charity stripe in Florida’s 75-64 
loss to North Carolina.
Donovan said the key to help-
ing Hill get to this point was in 
the technicalities.
“Getting him to understand 
how he needs to play and what he needs to do and letting him see himself on film making decision and choices on the fast break, you 
know getting in the lane, shots he 
was taking,” Donovan said. 
“And think I think he really 
took those things into the Baha-
mas and they helped him. I think 
they gave him a sense of a plan. It 
gave him a sense of, ‘OK I know 
what I need to do now and how to handle this.’”
the match we thought there might be some 
change in that. Honestly, you have to wonder if the (selection) committee was dismissed be-fore the match was over. That’s the only way I 
could think that there wasn’t a change in it.”
Despite its No. 5 ranking and the fact that it 
holds the only undefeated conference record in 
the top 25, UF is flying under the radar when compared to the nation’s other elite teams.
Perhaps it’s because its young players re-
ceive large chunks of playing time, although UF’s younger players play as well as anyone in the nation at their respective positions.
Southeastern Conference Freshman of the 
Year Rhamat Alhassan leads the nation in hit-ting percentage (.465), ahead of two seniors.
SEC Player of the Year Alex Holston is one 
of the most versatile hitters in the league, and racked up 41 kills over the week while record-ing the third most points in a match in Florida history, with 32 against Texas.
And junior Mackenzie Dagostino, while 
not as young as Holston and Alhassan but currently in her first year as Florida’s starting 
setter, is 16th in the nation in assists per set 
(11.41).
Entering the NCAA tournament, Florida 
has a chance to prove that its No. 8 seed has undersold them, and to show the nation why.
There is a different vibe around this Florida 
team now than there was in September.
Now, no one will feel good after a loss.September was a time for developing 
chemistry, for establishing starters and role players, for setting out a plan and devoting an entire season to achieve it.
But in December, things are different.In December, it’s time to win.THURSDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Patric Young’s basketball career 
is far from over.
After being waived by the New 
Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, the 
former Florida center is taking his talents overseas.
The 22-year-old Young signed a 
contract with Galatasaray S.K out of the Turkish Basketball League, the team announced Wednesday.
Galatasaray is one of the top 
teams in the Turkish Basketball 
League, finishing in the top four of 
the 16-team league in each of the past four years.
“This is part of my journey, an 
incredible blessing,” Young said via his Twitter account (@BigPatY-oung4) on Wednesday. “I finally can get off the bench and compete again. Im extremely happy right 
now.”
Young signed a two-year con-
tract with the New Orleans Pelicans 
on July 19 after showing promise 
during summer league play.
In five games, Young averaged 
7.4 points and eight rebounds while playing 25.2 minutes per game.
But with the Pelicans having a 
deep frontcourt, Young became ex-
pendable.
“Pat’s a great kid,” said UF 
coach Billy Donovan, who coached Young for four seasons. “I still be-lieve he has a career and future in the NBA. I think any team would be crazy not to take him. I’ve said 
this before. I’ve coached a lot of 
NBA guys and guys that are doing very well up there. He’s as good of a defensive center, frontcourt 
player that I’ve ever coached. He 
can bring value to Istanbul and to a team in the NBA. I think as long as he wants to play, he can have a very long career.”
Young, the 2014 Southeastern 
Conference Defensive Player of the Year and an honorable mention AP All-American, paced the Gators 
with 41 blocks while ranking 12th 
in the SEC with 6.2 rebounds per game last season. 
He finished his UF career as the 
11th player in Gators history to 
finish his career with at least 1300 
points and 800 rebounds.

It’s plane tracking season on 
social media as journalists and 
fans hotly pursue the moves of 
UF athletics director Jeremy Fo-
ley.
Both private planes registered to the University Athletics Asso-ciation with tail numbers N100FG 
and N101FG have been blocked 
from public tracking on the web-site FlightAware.com. 
The explanation from the 
website said the aircrafts are not 
available for public tracking “per 
request of the owner/operator.” The University Athletic Asso-
ciation had no comment on the 
matter.
Foley and at least three UF ex-
ecutives as well as spokesperson 
Steve McClain traveled to Fort Collins, Colorado, on a plane 
Tuesday with the tail number 
N843DW. Through FlightAware, alliga-
torSports found the plane was 
registered to a Jacksonville-based 
Aviation company whose prin-cipal partner is the son of a man that donated $21 million to UF in 2009. 
They went to speak to Colo-
rado State head coach Jim McEl-wain — who has been pegged by multiple media sources as the frontrunner for the head coaching job — and the presumption was that McElwain would be return-
ing to Gainesville with Foley and 
Co. 
But according to Yahoo! Sports, 
the talks have reached an impasse 
due to negotiations concerning 
the buyout price in McElwain’s contract, which is $7.5 million.16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2014
