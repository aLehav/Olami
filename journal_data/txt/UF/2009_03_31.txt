Gator breaks and enters, bites
EUSTIS, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a small alligator climbed 
through the porch door of a house north of Orlando and then bit 
the homeowner’s arm when it was forced out. The 2-foot-long al-ligator wandered onto James Gaff’s canal-front property in Lake County on Sunday.
 Gaff tried to remove the gator, which then latched onto his 
right forearm. A spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission says Gaff’s wife, Elaine, pried the gator off using a broom handle and the couple threw the reptile into the water be-hind their home. The 52-year-old Gaff was treated at a hospital for minor cuts and scrapes.� SHE IS  ONE OF THREE FINALISTS FOR PRESIDENT OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

Santa Fe College’s Anne Kress was named 
as one of three finalists Monday for president of 
Monroe Community College in Rochester, N.Y.
Kress, who was one of 32 applicants, joined the 
SFC staff in 1999 as an associate professor of Eng-lish.
Since then, she has held positions such as Eng-
lish department chair, interim vice president and her current position as provost and vice president of academic affairs.
“Anne has grown up professionally in her 
years at Santa Fe,” said SFC President Jackson Sasser. “She is an exceptional educational leader.”
Kress indicated her interest in the position 
about three months ago, and it took Sasser a while to get used to the idea of Kress leaving, Sasser said.
“It will be a tremendous loss for Santa Fe,” he 
said.
Although Kress said she would leave with 
mixed feelings, she recognizes that the new po-sition would provide an extraordinary opportu-
nity.

UF religion graduate student 
Leah Sarat often prays that what-ever happens to her job and research 
position, her talents still can be used to best serve the world.
Ever since Dean Paul D’Anieri 
of the College of Liberal Arts and 
Sciences announced the college’s 
$9.3 million budget cut proposal on 
March 18, Sarat, along with other 
members of the department, has worried about her future.
Anxiety has recently rippled 
throughout the university, especial-
ly tainting the departments, such as 
religion, where potential cuts could 
be among the steepest.
Sarat, 28, is a third-year doctoral student in the Religion in the Ameri-
cas program who conducts field 
research on religion’s role in some Mexicans’ decisions to come to the 
U.S. Her only source of income is 
her part-time job as a religion teach-
ing assistant at UF.D’Anieri’s proposal would slash 
the religion department’s budget by 
$808,000, much of which comes from faculty and staff layoffs, according 
to the presentation draft plan posted 
on the college’s Web site. SPECIAL REPORTReligion graduate students  speak out against cuts

Along with more staff and faculty layoffs, 
UF’s last sport and fitness classes are also on 
the chopping block after the release of budget cut proposals from three more colleges.The College of Health and Human Per-
formance proposal, which would cut about $866,000 and lay off 10 faculty and staff, in-cludes eliminating the scuba program, which currently plans to offer seven two-credit scuba diving classes in the fall.
Under the cut, Cheryl Thacker, coordinator of  the scuba program, would be laid off, sav-ing the college about $63,000.
Thacker said the 
cut would also affect a dozen other part-time scuba instruc-
tors, two graduate assistants and a repairman, as well as reduce business at dive shops in the city.
“It’s not just losing my position,” she said, 
“it’s also gonna affect the community.”
About 250 to 300 students a semester take 
the scuba classes, she said. Most sport and fit-Recreation classes may see cuts under new proposalSEE PROFESSOR, PA gE 5

80/653 dead, 1 injured in  
possible murder-suicide
LARGO  (AP) — Three people 
were found dead in a Tampa 
Bay-area home Monday in what police described as a possible murder-suicide.
Police responding to a report 
of a suicidal person around 6 a.m. heard a fourth person, Sherry Hice, calling for help.
Hice, 46, was shot but sur-
vived. She was airlifted to Bay-front Medical Center, where her condition was not immediately available.
Pinellas County Sheriff’s Of-
fice deputies forced their way 
into the back of the home and 
found the bodies of Hice’s room-
mate, Michael Duane Roberts, 57; Hice’s son, Tyler Newman, 21; and Newman’s girlfriend, Taylor 
Reiterman, 16. A mixed-breed lab 
was also killed.
Authorities haven’t identified 
the killer or determined a mo-
tive. Court documents indicate 
a recent history of domestic dis-
turbances at the home in Largo, 
about 25 miles west of Tampa.
Roberts’ family told the St. Pe-
tersburg Times that he let Hice, a 
breast cancer survivor, and her 
son move in about a year ago, but 
that they didn’t pay rent, invited people over and allowed New-man’s girlfriend to move in. 
They were aware of tensions 
in the home but didn’t suspect the situation would erupt into violence.
Officials could not say if there 
was a romantic relationship be-tween Hice and Roberts.
“My dad was lonely,” his 
daughter, Carolyn Roberts, 21, told the paper. “And he was al-ways trying to help people.”  University holds mass for 
Schiavo anniversary
NAPLES (AP) — A Catholic 
university in southwest Florida 
plans a mass on Tuesday to rec-ognize the fourth anniversary of Terri Schiavo’s death.
A new $24 million oratory 
on the campus of Ave Maria University will be the site of the mass for Schiavo, the Tampa-area woman who was at the center of an end-of-life case that captivated the nation.
Schiavo’s brother, Bobby 
Schindler, said he was seek-ing a higher profile for the an-nual mass when he approached Ave Maria University founder Thomas Monaghan, the Domi-nos Pizza magnate who built the 2-year-old college and sur-rounding community in farm fields east of Naples.
“It’s a prestigious univer-
sity,” Schindler told the Naples 
Daily News. “Mr. Monaghan is 
a leader in the pro-life move-ment and has been very sup-portive of us.”
Terri Schiavo’s husband, Mi-
chael Schiavo, fought her fam-ily in court for eight years over removal of her life support. 
He argued that she would 
not have wanted to be kept alive in what most doctors called a persistent vegetative state. She had no written ad-vance directive when she col-lapsed in 1990.Man charged with battery, molestation of girl, 12
BRADENTON  (AP) — A 
Florida man has been charged 
with multiple sex crimes in 
connection with the case of a 
12-year-old girl whose disap-pearance sparked an statewide Amber Alert on Sunday.
The 12-year-old girl ran 
away from her family’s Tampa Bay home Saturday after get-ting into an argument with her grandmother.  
Witnesses saw her get into 
a red Jeep driven by a middle-aged man who pulled over.
The child told authorities 
that Kenneth R. Ross took her back to his residence, gave her whiskey, watched pornograph-ic movies and had sex with her. 
She was dropped off near her 
home Sunday afternoon.
The Manatee County Sher-
iff’s Office says the 46-year-old admitted to the crimes.
In accordance with company 
policy, The Associated Press generally does not identify al-leged victims of sexual abuse.

 The 2004 movie “Super Size Me” showed the dangerous 
truth of an ballooning waistline due to a McDonald’s diet, 
but now, during the economic recession, the only thing bal-
looning for McDonald’s are its sales.
In Gainesville and northeast Florida, the fast food chain 
is selling more Big Macs, while the restaurant industry as a whole continues to struggle.
Allison Garrett, the account supervisor of Dalton Agen-
cy, a public relations agency for McDonald’s, said the stores were doing well throughout northeast Florida and the country.
“More people are going to quick-service restaurants 
now than sit-down restaurants,” Garrett said. “A college 
town like Gainesville is no different.”  
McDonald’s delivered 55 consecutive 
months of increases in global same-store sales 
as of November. In 2008, McDonald’s was only one of two companies whose Dow Jones 
industrial average share price rose in 2008, with shares gaining nearly 6 percent.
According to Richard Pollock, a certiﬁ  ed public accoun-
tant and ﬁ  nancial adviser, the fast-food chain will continue to be a solid stock option for investors.
McDonald’s sales efforts will continue at the end of 
April, when it will be offering hamburgers for 49 cents and cheeseburgers for 69 cents. On April 15, the stores will give a tax relief day,  during which customers can purchase a Quarter Pounder or Big Mac and get a second one for a penny.
Allison Dvorchik, a Gainesville mother of two, said her 
husband is often out of town, and she doesn’t have time to 
cook, making McDonald’s a quick and cheap option for her 
family occasionally.
Others, like Chris Lavery, a retired Gainesville resident, 
go to McDonald’s because they know they will spend more 
if they go to the grocery store.
“If I have to buy a whole meal at the grocery store, I 
know it is going to be more expensive than just going to McDonald’s for a bite,” Lavery said.However, the cheaper prices McDonald’s offers aren’t 
the only ingredient to the recipe that makes what McDon-
ald’s CEO Jim Skinner likes to call a “recession-resistant” 
restaurant.
After health critics practically accused the restaurant of 
making people fat, the chain added healthier food options to its menu such as apple slices and white-meat Chicken McNuggets.
Men’s Health magazine recently published an article rat-ing national food chains with a grade.  McDonald’s earned a B-minus, while others like Applebees, IHOP and Outback 
received F’s. Even some of Gainesville’s favorite sandwich 
shops didn’t fair as well as McDonald’s, with Jimmy John’s and Quiznos hovering between a C-minus and a B.
Garrett also attributed part of  the sales increase to its 
new addition to the coffee market. McCafe, the restaurant’s new coffee line, now offers coffee at a lower price than competitors such as Starbucks.

Stania Antoine, 20, left, and Roxana Bedia, 20, rally for the DREAM Act on the Pla -
za of the Americas Monday morning. If passed, the act would facilitate access to 
college for immigrants in the U.S. by restoring states’ rights to offer in-state tuition 
to immigrant students residing in their state. See story online at alligator.org.
ness classes, which used to include tennis, 
bowling and baseball, were eliminated af-ter the last round of cuts, she said.
“We were the last holdout,” Thacker 
said.
The college’s proposal would also close 
the Living Well program, which would require cutting the director and a staff member, and would eliminate the Ath-letic Training Education Program, which teaches students how to prevent and care for sports injuries. Those moves would save about $342,000.
Three faculty members would lose 
their jobs if the training program is elimi-nated, and four more staff would be cut if the college’s grant support program, which helps faculty apply for grants, is eliminated.
Two vacant faculty positions would 
also be cut, and a temporary faculty mem-ber’s contract would not be renewed.
Meanwhile, the College of Engineer-
ing’s proposal, which would cut about $5.4 million, includes 18 layoffs – 11 staff and seven faculty – which would save about $1.1 million. Eight vacant faculty positions would be eliminated, and the college would hire 23 fewer graduate as-sistants, saving about $1.3 million. The college would also have less money to spend on hiring temporary staff, such as student workers, cutting funding by about $250,000.
The plan would eliminate the college’s 
funding for UF-EDGE (Electronic Deliv-
ery of Graduate Education), its distance 
education program and reduce funding for the Particle Engineering and Research Center, saving about $840,000. 
The college plans to find other means 
of funding the programs. 
The rest of the money would be saved 
by not replacing retiring administrative staff, miscellaneous expense reductions 
and finding new funding for some faculty and staff, said engineering 
Dean Pramod Khargonekar.
The College of Fine Arts $1.27 million 
proposal includes at least twelve layoffs–five faculty and seven staff. The proposal also includes giving up the off-campus 
WARPhaus art studio and gallery, which 
would save about $111,000. 
The proposal would  cut funding for 
four vacant faculty and staff positions and would reduce the number of graduate as-sistants.
The remaining cuts would come from 
a  reorganization of administrative opera-tions within the college by moving staff 
from different programs to one location.WARPhaus also in jeopardy
The proposal is a response to UF President 
Bernie Machen’s request of a 10 percent bud-
get cut plan from each college and adminis-
trative unit, due to a possible decrease of $72 
million to $75 million in state funding in 2009-
2010, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said.
Under the proposed cut, Sarat doesn’t 
know whether she can complete her remain-ing two years as a graduate student at UF and 
be one of the lucky few to still teach religion 
at UF.
At 2 a.m. last week, Sarat was awake “ago-
nizing” over the possible cut with her room-
mate, a fellow UF religion major.
While buzz about a possible department 
cut has filled department members’ ears for 
several months, she said, she thinks about it 
throughout the day.
“It’s a pretty constant backdrop,” Sarat said.  “It’s just an uncertainty, and it’s just kind of hard to move on with your research 
and work.”   
Proposed department cuts have moved 
many to defend the importance of their stud-
ies. 
Sarat said religion influences the decisions 
of politicians and terrorists, adding that many people turn to religion to answer tough ques-
tions about things such as life and death, poli-
tics, society and race.  
In response to the proposal, Sarat led fel-
low religion graduate students in writing a grievance letter, which was posted on The 
Gainesville Sun’s Web site on Tuesday.
During lunch breaks in her office, Sarat’s 
colleagues and fellow graduate students vent 
their fears  about the proposal, she said.                       
Talk often centers on the worry that 65 per-
cent of the department’s budget will be cut, 
along with the elimination of about 10 profes-sors, possibly tenured faculty, leaving about 
four total to teach religion.
As a result, many who would be directly 
affected by the changes have turned to sug-
gesting creative solutions. 
Sarat said she joked about having a bake 
sale for the department, while fellow religion 
graduate student Mallory Bolduc helped 
spray-paint “Save Religion” on about  10 T-shirts.  
President Caleb Simmons of the Religion 
Graduate Student Association, 27, said after 
the dean’s presentation, he was so fired-up 
that he ran to his office to change into one of 
the shirts.  
“I knew there was a budget crisis, but I 
never thought it would affect the religion de-partment because it’s such a strong depart-
ment faculty-wise,” Simmons said.
Simmons, religion Chairwoman Vasudha 
Narayanan and a few others will meet with Provost Joe Glover on April 6 to plead their 
case against the cut.
Proposed budget cuts will not be finalized 
until the university’s budget is announced by 
the state, which will be after the legislative ses-
sion ends on May 1, Sikes said.
Machen and Glover will then submit their 
proposals to UF’s Board of Trustees to make 
the ultimate decisions about the cuts, she said.Proposed cuts have moved many to defend their department’s importanceUFAdministrationCUTS , from page 1

About 6,800 students have 
taken UF’s Student Experience at 
Research Universities (SERU) on-line survey, which almost all un-dergraduates have to take in order to be eligible for the football ticket lottery.
UF hopes to use the survey to 
improve student programs and academic offerings, said Marie Ze-glen, UF’s assistant provost and di-rector of Institutional Planning and Research.
Though the survey is being 
conducted while UF is examining ways to meet a possible $72 million to $75 million budget cut, it will not be used to determine which programs should stay or go next year, Zeglen said.
The University of California at 
Berkeley was contracted at a price of $18,000 to create the survey, she said. That money doesn’t count the time UF staff have put into imple-menting it and will spend studying the results this summer.
There has been some confusion 
recently as to whether the survey is mandatory, including an e-mail sent to the French department list-serv by an adviser stating the survey 
is “com-p u l s o r y for all U.F. majors.” 
Even though it’s not manda-
tory, some students are not too thrilled with the survey.
“It was very repetitive and real-
ly annoying,” said UF elementary education junior Katy Gibson.
“I don’t think you should have 
to take it to get football tickets,” she added.
Students who are under 18 
years old, non-degree seeking or only enrolled in correspondence courses are not required to take the survey to get tickets.
- THOMAS STEWART  
and CHELSEA KEENAN6,800 take surveyBALTIMORE (AP) — A 
former religious cult mem-
ber pleaded guilty Monday to starving her 1-year-old son to death after making an unusual deal with prosecutors: If the child is resurrected, her plea will be withdrawn.
Ria Ramkissoon, 22, also 
agreed to testify against four other members of the now-defunct religious group known as 1 Mind Ministries. All four are charged with first-degree murder in the death of Javon Thompson.
According to a statement of 
facts, the cult members stopped feeding the boy when he refused to say “Amen” after a meal. Af-ter Javon died, Ramkissoon sat next to his decomposing body and prayed for his resurrection. Ramkissoon’s attorney, Steven D. Silverman, said Ramkissoon believes the resurrection will oc-cur. She agreed to plead guilty only after prosecutors said they would drop the charges if the child comes back to life, Silver-man said.
“This is something that she 
absolutely insisted upon, and this is indicative of the fact that she is still brainwashed, still a victim of this cult,” he said. “Until she’s deprogrammed, she’s not going to think any dif-ferently.”
Former cult member charged
munity colleges as a gateway to universities,” 
Kress said. “It is a wonderful day to work for community colleges and a wonderful step in my professional journey.”
Kress said SFC is an important part of 
Gainesville and of her professional life, adding that it has been hard to think of leaving.
“The only reason I would ever think of leaving 
would be to go to a community college like Santa Fe where there is a shared emphasis of success and a community who is dedicated to academic excellence,” she said.
The other finalists are Kevin Drumm, president 
of Northern Wyoming Community College District and Gordon May, president of the Highland Lakes Campus of Oakland Community College in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.  
Kress said the president of the community college will be selected in early April with a starting date in July.Kress said it will be ‘wonderful step’

Financial Flub 
America’s economic 
downturn has ush-ered in tumultuous 
financial times across col-lege campuses, leaving some 
schools to employ question-
able tactics during the admis-sions process.
According to an article in 
The New York Times, pro-spective students able to pay tuition out of pocket, as op-posed to relying on financial aid, have become the apple 
of admissions officers’ eyes in 
the wake of mounting budget cuts.
Unfortunately, doing this 
goes against the general prac-tice employed by universities in which applicants’ academic futures are determined on a need-blind basis.
By disregarding the cus-
tom of admitting students regardless of their zip code or lack of Ferrari, schools across the nation are serving to limit the collegiate possibilities for teenagers from lower-income families.
The changes to the applica-tion process have resulted in wealthy parents discouraging their sons or daughters from indicating on their applica-tions an interest in financial 
aid — thereby boosting their 
chances for admission.
For schools like Brandeis 
University, simply manipu-lating their admission prac-tices has allowed the college to continue to consider them-selves need-blind.
Since Brandeis’ interna-
tional, wait-listed and trans-fer students are judged based upon their financial back-grounds, the school has re-sorted to accepting more ap-plicants who fall under such distinctions.
The Editorial Board under-
stands that the current eco-
nomic climate has forced the 
hands of college presidents into making difficult budget cut decisions. 
But wealthier students 
shouldn’t be shown favorit-ism over those who are less affluent with otherwise equal applications.
The people who have to clean up our worldwide 
financial mess are meeting in London this week to talk. The G20 summit brings together bankers 
and leaders from across the globe, and this year they need to piece together what is left of the world econo-my. Most expect President Obama to do a lot of listen-ing and apologizing. 
Obama will have to convince the rest of the big coun-
tries to kick in billions of their own stimulus dollars for our bank bailouts to work effectively. 
The money we spend here will undoubtedly leave 
our borders and help other economies, and our banks 
are too diverse to really be called a property of any one 
nation.
Thankfully, I have a plan.News reports this week have stated that Obama 
plans to bring an entourage of more than 500 people to London with him to “handle any crisis, anywhere, any time.” 
Vince Offer simply has to be among the chosen (quite 
a) few who will make this beggars trip to Britain. Many 
of you may know Vince as the “ShamWow guy” or the 
“SlapChop guy.” That a single man can truly captivate the hearts and wallets of millions of Americans is only the first sign he should be one of our chief negotiators 
at the G20.
Vince cares deeply about the quality of life in Amer-
ica. Using the metaphor of canned tuna, the most banal 
of foods, Vince and his SlapChop force each of us to rec-ognize that we are ultimately responsible for our own 
lot in life. 
Though terribly unappetizing, a pile of tuna chopped 
up with radishes and carrots perfectly represents the potential excitement and vivacity 
of a life fulfilled.
Onions, much like huge finan-
cial meltdowns, needn’t be a rea-son to worry with Vince involved in our highest echelons of gov-ernment.  
Displaying an intimate knowl-
edge of psychological practices and the art of manual food pro-cessing, Vince knows how we all hurt and only wants to help. As 
the great man states with sagacity, life is hard enough as it is. 
Vince is an invaluable asset to the Obama negotia-
tion team. Already well versed in globalized trade intri-
cacies through his involvement in the German towel ex-
port structure, Vince also knows how to close the deal.
How many ShamWows would it take to soak up 
all the toxic assets in our global economy right now — three, maybe four?
Sure, Vince isn’t perfect; he was arrested last month 
in Miami for punching a prostitute. Turns out, though, the fair lady was biting his tongue and warranted such a thrashing for refusing to release from her clenched teeth 
what may one day be considered a national treasure.
Who among us can’t relate to such a predicament? 
President Obama, Vince deserves a shot at these 
negotiations. After he knocks the socks off these G20 suckers, Vince also has a brilliant solution for fixing our 
health care reform — one chop at a time. 
Tommy Maple is an international communications 
graduate student. His column appears on Mondays.Over the past two days, automotive giants Chrysler and 
GM have been held increasingly accountable by the Obama Administration for their lack of action.
In the wake of Monday’s announcement, in which the White 
House orchestrated the exit of GM’s chairman, President Barack 
Obama’s latest words amount to what The New York Times is 
calling “a do-or-die ultimatum.” 
Speaking on Tuesday, Obama outlined his expectations for 
the two beleaguered corporations – strict standards that must be met if the companies wish to continue to receive additional tax dollars from the government. 
One of the first measures included under the plan requires 
Chrysler and Fiat to join a partnership within the next 30 days if the automaker seeks to appeal for increased financial support.
Obama hopes that the pressure placed on the automotive 
industry will lead to greater emphasis on restructuring the re-lationship between creditors, unions and stakeholders so that additional bailout money is not spent in vain.
The Editorial Board agrees with the Obama Administra-
tion’s decision to, at the very least, appear to hold the automo-tive industry more accountable for its failure to better utilize the funds allocated to it in the latest bailout package. 
We wonder, though, if Chrysler and GM fail to heed Obama’s 
warning, will the president continue to clean up the mess that is the auto industry or finally hold it accountable for its inaction?
For Obama, his administration’s increased heat on Detroit 
should work to soothe public opinion, but the true challenge remains 60 days from now when revised plans are due from the two automotive giants.

Concealed carry laws justified
As a concealed-weapons permit holder 
and admitted UF law student, I couldn’t 
help but shake my head at Monday’s Al-ligator editorial “Guns have no place on college campuses,” in which the question was posed, “Who is to say that if passed, these bills won’t lead to coeds pulling guns on their significant other over a minor dis-agreement or professors feeling unsafe in their own classrooms?”
Do we really have to premise the debate 
on already-disproved grounds? 
When Florida passed “right to carry” 
legislation in 1987, the same predictions were made. “Blood will run in the streets, permit holders will just ‘snap’ during mi-nor arguments,” we were told. Despite these apocalyptic warnings, Armageddon never happened. 
Today, one in 37 adult Floridians is li-
censed to carry a firearm, and studies ana-lyzing the 22 years that Florida has been is-suing permits have repeatedly found such conclusions as “Florida permit holders are 300 times less likely than the general popu-lation to commit a crime (Hoover Institu-tion, Stanford University)” and “157 out of 1,104,468 permits (0.014 percent) have been revoked due to firearms-related violations (FL Dept. of State, 2005)”?
My question to the Editorial Board is 
given the proven track record of Florida permit holders, what makes a permit hold-er somehow more dangerous on campus than at, say, Wal-Mart? 
Does crossing an imaginary line magi-cally transform him into a killer?
If concealed carry makes you shudder, 
perhaps you shouldn’t go to Wal-Mart. 
Chances are you’ll pass one of the 3 percent 
who are packing heat.

Guns on campus editorial lacks fact
Leave it to the Alligator Editorial Board 
to argue gun rights on purely emotional rather than logical or factual grounds. 
They pose a couple of hypothetical situ-
ations in which a concealed weapon holder wildly pulls out his or her gun and reck-lessly endangers the lives of others. 
Never mind that concealed weapon 
holders have the lowest violent crime rate 
of any demographic in the U.S. 
Never mind that Utah has allowed con-
cealed carry on nine public campuses since 
2006, and none of these colleges have re-ported a single instance of gun-related vio-lence, accident or theft in that time.
Never mind that in order to obtain a con-
cealed weapon license, one must complete several tests to prove one’s proficiency and safety with the weapon. 
Never mind that public universities are 
state properties, and concealed carry is per-mitted in movie theaters, shopping malls, grocery stores and many other very public areas. 
Even if you view the Second Amend-
ment as somewhat outdated (as do I), it is irrelevant to the subject at hand. The government is inclined to legislate 
based on the Constitution, and until the 
Second Amendment is changed it is in-
clined to allow concealed carry in certain 
areas, public universities included. 
It is hilarious to see concealed carry ad-
vocates labeled as “gun nuts” while those 
against it are the ones arguing against 
widely available statistics. 
For every hypothetical you concoct 
where a law-abiding gun owner snaps and 
shoots up the place, I can point to cold hard 
facts.
Start brainstorming. 
Kyle Sandell

Guns editorial irrational, alarmist
The editorial printed in Monday’s Alli-
gator about concealed carry on campus was 
irrational and unduly alarmist. 
Statements of fears such as “coeds pull-
ing guns on their significant other over a minor disagreement” are patently absurd. People who would be carrying guns on campus, if the Texas bill is passed, are the people who already are licensed to carry guns in other public places, such as malls or restaurants. 
As of Feb. 28 in Alachua County, there 
were 5,613 people who had a permit to car-ry concealed, a general gun license or both. 
Why have we not seen a rash of shoot-
ings from people with concealed carry li-censes in malls over trivial arguments? By the logic of the Alligator Editorial staff, this should have already been documented, be-
cause any student who has a carry permit 
could conceivably have his firearm in the 
mall, and I’ve seen plenty of arguments 
take place in the Oaks Mall. 
The answer is the people with concealed 
carry permits are not the ones who shoot people willy-nilly. 
Being law-abiding citizens who regis-
tered their firearms in the first place and are fully aware of the responsibility that en-
tails, they aren’t going to go off half-cocked 
over a stupid provocation.  
It is the people who buy Saturday-night 
specials and don’t register them, or illegal fully automatic weapons, who commit the 
majority of gun crimes. 
What is the key factor that relates these 
people?  
They are not licensed for concealed carry. 
Also, the statement that the Texas legisla-
tors who are sponsoring this bill are touting it as a “cure-all to ending school shootings” 
is misleading. Supporters of the bills say 
that they will reduce the likelihood, not be a cure-all; the legislators themselves have 
made no statements to that effect. 
These bills would just be the continua-
tion of rights that are already in existence in 
the vast majority of public places. 
In conclusion, Alligator Editorial staff, 
there is no need to use inflammatory and childish statements based on faulty prem-
ise. Next time, look up the facts  to support 
your conclusions.

ON TELEVISION I DID NOT KNOW THAT SEC EAST BASEBALL SCOREBOARDAndrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF guard Nick Calathes drives during the Gators’ 71-62 NIT quarterfinal loss to Penn State in the O’Connell Center on 
March 24. Calathes entered his name into the NBA Draft on Monday but will be eligible to return to UF next year.
BY MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
UF point guard Nick Calathes is ready to test his NBA 
prospects. The sophomore said he will put his name into 
the upcoming NBA draft but will not hire an agent.
“I spoke with coach Donovan (on Sunday) night and 
told him of my intentions,” Calathes said in a statement. 
“(He) was nothing but supportive, (and he) told me he’d 
do whatever he could to help me and my family make an educated decision.”
By not hiring an agent, Calathes will 
be able to return to Gainesville for his ju-nior season if he is not comfortable with his draft projections.
“I love the University of Florida and 
am leaving my option to return open,” 
Calathes said. “This is a great opportu-
nity to take some time, look at my future 
beyond college, collect information and see where I’m at.”
Calathes averaged 17.2 points, 6.4 assists and 5.3 re-
bounds per game this season. His 231 assists this season broke his own school record of 221 set a year ago.
“I don’t even think it’s about (being ready) anymore,” 
UF coach Billy Donovan said after the Gators’ season-end-ing loss in the National Invitation Tournament. “I think the 
one thing that people don’t understand about the NBA is 
it’s a league of investments, and you’re making an invest-ment. A lot of times you are making a long-term invest-ment, and you are hoping that your investment gets better and better and better.”
Calathes had the third triple-double in school history in 
the Gators’ home win against Georgia on Jan. 28. He is also 
the owner of the second triple-double at UF, which came 
against Creighton in the second round of the 2008 NIT.
The deadline for underclassmen to declare for the draft 
is April 26. Players have until June 15 to remove their names.Calathes to enter NBA Draft with option to return

Alligator Staff Writer
bsteele@alligator.org
A little less than a year ago, Ur-
ban Meyer said it would be hard to 
keep incoming freshman defensive tackle Omar Hunter off the field.
You could almost shove all of 
Hunter’s 308 pounds out there with the first-team defense.
Meyer wasn’t bashful about 
praising Hunter’s abilities, calling him the Tim Tebow of last year’s re-cruiting class. 
When Hunter arrived in 
Gainesville last summer, the blogs started up and the message boards oozed in anticipation.
He was considered one of the 
biggest — if not the biggest — prize of the 2008 recruiting class, and for good reason. Hunter was the No. 2 defensive lineman by Scout.com and Rivals.com. 
Unlike previous underachievers 
at defensive tackle, Hunter looked like one of those rare freshmen who would start as soon as they could find his jersey size.
Hunter’s back and ankle had 
other ideas. The freshman was con-stantly injured, and as Lawrence Marsh and Terron Sanders stepped up to grab the starting tackle posi-tions, Hunter and his potential be-came distant memories for fans. 
In what would have been a shock-
er for Meyer and his staff when they signed him, Hunter redshirted after playing in just three games.
“It was a rough first year,” he 
said. “A lot of things set me back.”Now, after being on campus for 
almost a year, Hunter is getting his chance to rise up the depth chart and back into prominence.
“It’s time,” defensive line coach 
Dan McCarney said. “He’s been here since May, almost a year. It’s time.”
Hunter’s playing chances have 
improved since tackles Torrey Davis and John Brown left UF’s program a little more than two weeks ago.
Still, for a former five-star recruit 
who was praised on nearly every down for the first 18 years of his life, having to compete for playing time is unknown territory.
“I’ve learned those stars don’t 
mean nothing. Absolutely nothing,” Hunter said. “When you get here, everyone’s on an even playing field. Everyone’s just as big as you, just as fast as you, just as strong as you.”
In other words, it was time for 
Hunter to man up.
“It’s definitely different,” Hunter 
said. “I’m willing to earn my stripes. Whatever I have to do. If I have to play the backup role until Marsh is gone, that’s what I’m going to do.”
That competitive attitude is ex-
actly what Meyer has grown to love about his program now. A few years ago, a healthy Hunter could have been guaranteed multiple snaps a game. Not anymore.“There’s no free lunches around 
here,” McCarney said.
For Hunter, it didn’t even seem 
like a healthy body came free of charge. Hunter called part of the season “depressing” and said there were times when he really wanted to quit.
“I felt like I couldn’t do anything 
right,” Hunter said.
Then strength coach Mickey Ma-
rotti talked to Hunter, and the red-shirt freshman realized there’s still much he wants to accomplish. Even though he had such high expecta-tions coming in, Hunter was still just a freshman with four years of play-ing time ahead of him.
“He’s a better player,” McCarney 
said. “He needs to be in the rotation, and it’s up to him to do that.”

It’s hard to say which causes a 
bigger swing in momentum — win-
ning a rivalry game or losing a rival-ry game with a rematch scheduled just two weeks later. 
When UF (18-8) and FSU (16-8) 
met in McKethan Stadium on March 17 for the first of three games this season, both teams were struggling to earn victories. 
The No. 20 Gators came in to the 
matchup after suffering a sweep at the hands of Arkansas that capped off a stretch of seven losses in their 
last 11 games. Similarly, FSU had 
just dropped a game to Virginia, making it six losses in its last nine. 
With both teams desperate for 
a win, UF edged out FSU 5-4 in a 3-hour-51-minute St. Patrick’s Day marathon. 
“This team has been down on 
itself, and it was a tough week-
end at Arkansas,” UF coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said after the win. “Base-ball is a really difficult game be-cause of a lot of mental stuff going on, so we just tried to wipe the slate clean.”
Since junior catcher Buddy Mun-
roe laced the walk-off single to right-center field that gave the Gators that 
5-4 win, the team has ridden a wave 
of momentum all the way in to to-night’s contest with the Seminoles in Jacksonville at 7. 
UF has won nine of its last 10 
games, including sweeps of Tennes-see and Alabama, and has climbed 
into Baseball America’s Top 25 for 
the first time since Feb. 23 after start-ing the season 3-0. 
Senior Stephen Locke (0-0, 0.00 
ERA), who rejoined the team in the middle of last week, will get the start in his second appearance of the sea-son. The Gators have had trouble finding a consistent starting rotation, 
and the return of Locke should give 
them a stabilizing veteran capable of eating up innings. 
“He gives us more depth and 
another quality left-hander that has been there, done that,” O’Sullivan said.
FSU, however, has been just 
as hot since the dramatic defeat at 
the hands of its in-state rival. The 
Seminoles have won seven of their last eight and are coming off a road sweep of Maryland in College Park. 
If the momentum FSU is riding 
isn’t enough to equal that of UF, perhaps a little history will serve as a boost.
The Gators also took the first 
game of the series last season in Gainesville before getting shel-lacked in Jacksonville 10-2 and nar-
rowly dropping the third game 4-2 
in Tallahassee. 
While Locke and a slew of fresh-
man arms such as Alex Panteliodis (2-2, 4.20 ERA), Anthony DeSclafani (2-0, 3.80 ERA) and Greg Larson (2-1, 1.42 ERA) have provided an un-expected lift for UF, preseason ace Patrick Keating (2-3, 5.72 ERA) has been surprisingly disappointing in the early part of the season. 
The senior has all but lost his Fri-
day-night designation and has been relegated to the bullpen at times 
during the season.Against FSU, O’Sullivan went 
to Keating to shut the door in the 
ninth inning, but the right-hander coughed up the lead and allowed the Seminoles to tie the game. 
Despite Keating’s struggles, his catcher is optimistic that he can turn things around.  
“Pat’s going to be fine,” Munroe 
said. “He’s always got good stuff. I got more confidence in him than 
anyone else.”Gators, Seminoles to resume rivalry in Jacksonville

FORT MYERS — Tampa Bay Rays starting pitcher 
Matt Garza faced his former team for the first time, 
but the Minnesota Twins had the upper hand.
Garza, named the Most Valuable Player of the 
2008 American League Championship Series, struck 
out five batters but gave up 3 earned 
runs off eight hits in six innings of a 
3-2 loss to the Twins on Monday.
“I just got my work in,” said 
Garza, a first-round draft pick by the Twins in 2005 out of Fresno 
State.
The Twins traded Garza and 
shortstop Jason Bartlett to the Rays 
for infielder Brendan Harris and 
outfielders Delmon Young and Jason Pridie before 
last season began.
“I really didn’t think about facing my old team 
or anything like that,” said Garza, who pitched well 
despite the loss in front of a crowd of 5,072 fans, 
the smallest crowd this spring training at Hammond 
Stadium.
“I felt great,” he said. “I felt lively.”
Rays manager Joe Maddon said he enjoyed 
watching Garza grow in his first season as a Ray. 
Garza went 2-0 with a 1.38 ERA against the Bos-
ton Red Sox during the ALCS. 
“His confidence is at a very high level right now,” 
Maddon said.Garza gets loss

Good move, Billy Donovan.
The UF men’s basketball coach passed up the 
Kentucky job for the second time in three years 
Friday.
The never-ending speculation surrounding now-for-
mer Wildcats coach Billy Gillispie had Donovan in the 
running well before Gillispie was officially fired at 4:30 
p.m. Friday.
Donovan did not take long to quell the rumors.
Donovan, a former Kentucky assistant coach under 
Rick Pitino, released the following statement shortly af-ter the Wildcats formally announced one of the worst-
kept secrets of last week: Gillispie’s firing.
“In response to the rumors circulating about my in-
terest in other jobs, I wanted to address this as quickly 
as possible. I am committed to the University of Florida 
and look forward to continuing to build our program 
here.”
My editors, in fact, found it so insignificant (or per-
haps old) that they put no mention of the incident in 
Monday’s paper.
I beg to differ. This is an important decision for both 
Donovan and UF.
Listen, the grass isn’t always greener. An ironic but 
obvious example of this is the Kentucky problem itself. 
Wildcats boosters ran Tubby Smith out of town in 2007 because he didn’t meet their expectations. 
Whether those expectations are in any way realistic in 
this day and age — where parity is higher and no power 
ever really stays at the top anymore — is a topic for an-
other column.
In 10 seasons, Smith won a national championship 
and made the Elite Eight on three other occasions. He won the Southeastern Conference regular season and 
SEC Tournament titles five times each. He averaged 
more than 26 wins per season and won more than 75 percent of his games.That brought Gillispie to Lex-
ington, Ky., after Donovan, who reached unprecedented status 
among the coaching ranks after 
winning back-to-back national titles, turned down the Wildcats’ offer before his Orlando Magic fi-
asco.
It’s hard to believe Donovan 
will ever make his way to Lexing-
ton now. He has spurned the Wildcats twice, clearly let-
ting them know the Kentucky job does not mean more to 
him than his current beloved status in Gainesville.
I would be the first to agree that Donovan under-
achieved the past two years by missing the NCAA 
Tournament in back-to-back seasons after making nine 
straight appearances in the field of 65.
Some have pointed out how much better the Gators 
would have been if Donovan had been able to beat out 
Gillispie for All-SEC big man Patrick Patterson. It is a 
valid point.
Still, the Gators had plenty of talent to get to the Big 
Dance this year, but it was unfortunately only shown in 
too-short glimpses. Not being able to get the most out 
of his players is a knock on Donovan, and his revelation 
March 23 that this year’s team “overachieved” is, quite frankly, ridiculous.
But if Donovan (rather than his players) receives most 
of the criticism for the failed rebuilding effort, he cannot 
also be denied the praise earned for two straight national 
championships.
It’s one of the terrible double standards in America: 
Players get the praise, and coaches get the blame.
So celebrate the news that Donovan is returning to 
Gainesville, because now his name will remain synony-mous with UF.
And that’s best for all parties involved.Donovan smart to remain in Gainesville

Those on hand to watch UF’s 
spring practices in the past week 
have been treated to a bizarre 
sight: quarterbacks Tim Tebow 
and John Brantley taking snaps under center.
Under new offensive coordi-
nator Steve Addazio, the Gators are experimenting with the I-for-mation in addition to their usual spread offense.
“We’re testing it out, I guess 
you could say,” Brantley said. “We’ll see how it goes.”
According to coach Urban 
Meyer, it’s not going very well so 
far. 
Meyer cited the lack of depth 
at tight end and the absence of 
a dependable fullback as rea-sons why the I-formation doesn’t 
have a promising future for the 
Gators.
“That I-package, I’m not sure 
how long that will be sticking 
around here,” Meyer said. 
“You want to have it in, but 
like I said four years ago when I 
walked on this campus, we don’t really have an offense (for it). 
It’s an offense based on what we have, so we can run (the I-forma-
tion) all we want, but if the play-ers struggle or they’re young and inexperienced, we won’t run that package.”
Last spring, the Gators prac-ticed in formations with two tight ends to utilize Cornelius Ingram and Aaron Hernandez. But those plans took a big hit 
when Ingram went down with a knee injury and missed the entire season.
With Ingram now headed for 
an NFL career, Hernandez is the only reliable tight end left.
“Right now, you have Aaron 
Hernandez, who’s playing great — one of the top five players on the team — but (freshman Des-mond) Parks has no idea which way right or left is, and the full-
backs are struggling as well, so 
it’s not looking very good,” Mey-er said.
OKINE BEEFING UP: Earl Okine has eaten and lifted his way into a new position.
The Gainesville High gradu-
ate and redshirt freshman was re-
cruited as a 235-pound defensive end, but at 280 pounds, his future is on the interior of the defensive 
line.
“Coach McCarney had a feel-
ing (Okine would end up at de-
fensive tackle),” Meyer said. “I 
thought he’d be a Jarvis Moss-
type end, but he just keeps grow-ing and growing.
“He’s up to 280 pounds, 
benching 400. And he’s not done 
growing, either.”16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 2009

The two-game losing streak didn’t last 
long for Santa Fe College.
The Saints (20-15, 9-4 Mid-Florida Con-
ference) defeated St. John’s River Commu-
nity College 8-5 on Monday with the help of starting pitcher Bobby Bolling.
Bolling, who is undefeated this season, 
pitched a complete game, gave up seven hits and had seven strikeouts.
“Bobby did exactly what he has been do-
ing all year, and that is throwing strikes,” Saints coach Johnny Wiggs said. “He has 
given us a chance to win, and that is all we 
can ask of him.”
Wiggs and his staff opted to sit certain 
starters who have been struggling this 
season and give bench players a chance to 
prove themselves worthy to play in the fi-nal stretch of the season.
“We try every game to put the best line-
up on the field,” he said. “If guys on the bench are playing well, then they deserve the opportunity to get in there and play.”
Saints left fielder Andy Mee continued 
his hot streak by leading the Saints with three hits for the game. Catcher Brett Boze-man brought home 3 runs in his five at-bats, while third baseman Chad Graziano 
had two hits and an RBI.
Although Wiggs is not counting on an-
other nine-game winning streak, the Saints 
will take a conference win wherever they can get it.
“It’s good to get back on the winning 
way after losing one on Friday and one on Saturday,” he said.
On Wednesday, SFC will travel to 
square off against Central Florida Commu-nity College.  The Patriots trail the Saints by one game in the MFC standings. Cur-rently in first place, SFC leads third-place SJRCC by two games after Monday.
“It is way too early to be scoreboard-
watching,” Wiggs said. “Every year it is a super-competitive conference, and it comes down to the final few games.”Bolling pitches complete game to stop losing skidMeyer doesn’t see I-formation in Gators’ future
