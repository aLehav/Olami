Ryan Lochte’s reality show debuted Sunday 
night, and UF students have mixed reac-tions.
“What Would Ryan Lochte Do?” chroni-
cles Lochte’s life as he spends time with his family and parties in Gainesville.Midtown bars 101 Cantina and Balls were 
featured in the show’s ﬁ  rst episode, along with Dragonﬂ  y Sushi and Sake Company.
Matthew Lewis Chiles, a 24-year-old 
UF political science senior and Dragonﬂ  y server, said he thinks the show will increase business.
“He’s a pretty recognizable ﬁ  gure com-
ing into the establishment,” he said.
Chiles, who once served Lochte, said the show brings Gainesville into the spotlight.
“There’s going to be 
more attention brought to the city,” he said.
But the 28-year-old 
gold medalist’s show has some students question-ing how the program will reﬂ  ect on UF.
Telecommunication freshman Kaylee 
Glyder, 19, said the premiere did not live up to the hype.Chris Boyett, a 19-year-old UF English 
freshman, did not watch the episode, but thinks the show will have a negative im-pact.
“I think it’ll be used against UF by other 
colleges who are competing with us,” he said.
Boyett said Lochte’s behavior reﬂ  ects 
poorly on the school and on athletes. He said he has no plans to watch the reality show.
“It would just make me mad and [put] 
me in a bad mood,” Boyett said. UF students give Lochte show jeahs — and nahs

The new Rawlings Plaza was busy Monday after-
noon with hungry customers, sustainability initia-
tives, and food and drink freebies for students.
Gator Dining Services, along with partners Pepsi 
Co. and Sustainable UF, celebrated the grand open-ing of Rawlings Plaza’s Provisions on Demand Mar-ket and Subway. The plaza opened in early March.
At the celebration, the two winners of Pepsi’s Zero 
Waste Contest were awarded $5,000 grants for their ideas on how to make UF’s campus more sustain-able.
Graham Area Council President Brandy Myers 
handed out free reusable bags to students. Her area’s winning idea was to promote reusable bags to reduce the use of plastic bags.
“Whether it’s our bags or someone else’s, the 
whole goal is sustainability,” said the 20-year-old UF ﬁ  nance and criminology sophomore.

A UF student, claiming he was under the inﬂ  uence of 
LSD, was arrested early Monday after he stripped in front 
of police and later struck an ofﬁ  cer.
Gainesville Police arrested Michael Joseph Silecchia, 
19, on charges of resisting arrest and battery on an ofﬁ  cer or medical personnel, according to a GPD arrest report.
At about 1 a.m. Saturday, ofﬁ  cers responded to the 
Campus Club Apartments, at 4000 SW 37th Blvd., after residents reported Si-lecchia was running through the halls of Building 5, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
When police arrived, Silecchia took his 
clothes off and said he was “God” and “straight.” He also said to ofﬁ  cers, “Don’t cut my penis off,” then changed his mind 
and said, “Cut my penis off,” according to the report.
He then told ofﬁ  cers he took acid. However, police couldn’t conﬁ  rm if Silecchia was un-
der the inﬂ  uence of the drug.
While ofﬁ  cers struggled to subdue Silecchia, he turned 
and punched a female ofﬁ  cer in the head, according to the report.
Ofﬁ  cers used a Taser on Silecchia about six times and 
held him on the ground until more ofﬁ  cers secured and arrested him.
Silecchia was later taken to Shands at UF, where he spat 
at a hospital employee, police said.
Following Silecchia’s three-day treatment at the hospi-
tal, ofﬁ  cers booked him into the Alachua County Jail early Monday, Tobias said. 
Silecchia remained in custody later that night with an 
$80,000 bond.

‘Bidder 70’ at the Hippodrome 
CinemaThe Hippodrome Cinema is showing “Bidder 70” on Tuesday at 7:15 p.m. as part of its Cinema Lounge series. The documentary film follows Tim DeChristopher, who, as a college student, bids on 22,000 acres of wilderness, with no intention to pay, in order to save it from those who would drill for oil. Though the auction had been invalidated in 2009, DeChristopher was charged with two federal penalties. In the face of these incredible odds, he stepped up his activism in climate justice as he waited for his trial. He has just been released from incarceration Sunday, and after the film, the Hipp will screen the Q-and-A between DeChristopher and audiences outside the prison that had occurred upon his release. For more info and to buy tickets, visit www.thehipp.org or call 352-375-HIPP.

Adorable Blaine (Nicholas Downs) can’t seem to meet guys, let alone form a relationship. His beefy go-go boy roommate, Cameron, who has no shortage of willing partners, can’t understand why Blaine doesn’t just pounce and enjoy some one-nighters. Instead, Blaine hides in chat rooms, where he meets Zander, a shy, recently relocated Texan. But when the time comes to exchange photos, Blaine accidentally sends an image of his hunky roomie, and things go from romantically promising to downright confusing.

Joshua Pauls, a 19-year-old UF applied physiology and kinesiology sophomore, wins an iPad 
and has the Solar Dok Station named in his honor at the Rawlings Plaza opening Monday.
Solar panels let students charge
Leaf tea and Cracker Jack’d snacks.
Health science freshman Katherine 
Anderson stood in line at the Plaza to 
enter in a drawing for a cooler from Sus-tainable UF. 
She said the new Rawlings Plaza is 
very convenient.
“I can just get straight off the bus and 
go in there if I’m hungry,” the 19-year-old said.
Marketing Program Manager for 
Gator Dining Services Jill Rodriguez poured Cracker Jack’d snacks into sam-pling cups for students.
“Rawlings Plaza is a one-stop shop 
for solar docks and sampling,” she said.
At the event, a few UF officials un-
veiled the plaza’s new Solar Dok Sta-tion, which has electrical outlets as well as USB ports. 
The solar panels on top of the um-brella absorb sunlight energy which is stored in the battery below the picnic table. The station can be powered up to four hours without sunlight.
“What better day to add a Dok Sta-
tion on Earth Day,” said Vice President for Business Affairs Curtis Reynolds.
The station is the first table in the 
core of campus, said Associate Director for Business Services David Looney. He said a few other tables are located at Sun Terrace at Shands and in the married housing areas.
Joshua Pauls entered a contest to 
have the station dedicated to his name in early March. The applied physiol-ogy and kinesiology sophomore said he didn’t expect to win the contest.
“One day, I got an email, and lo and 
behold, I have an iPad and a Solar Dok Station,” the 19-year-old said.

FOUR INSTALLMENTS.

Hard work paid off for two former 
Gators. 
The Tampa Bay chapter of The Indus 
Entrepreneurs recently agreed to pay 
Feathr, a smartphone app, $150,000 in four quarterly installments for 20 per-cent equity in the company, according to a press release.
Former UF students Aidan Augustin 
and Neal Ormsbee, both 22, founded Feathr, which allows users to swap net-working information in real time during conferences. Kunal Jain, president of TiE Tampa Bay, said he recognized the business opportunity when he heard it. It would cost him and three other TiE in-vestors $150,000.
The investment is the first business 
venture of TiE’s debut in Florida, Jain said.
“When I met [Augustin], I found him 
to be very energetic,” he said. “I quickly realized he had a fire in his belly.”
Augustin said he and Ormsbee 
dropped out of UF in 2012 during their senior year to take the startup company to the next level.
“Switching from the classic college 
lifestyle into now working 60 to 80 hours every week is exhausting,” Augustin said. “Neal and I had never worked that hard on anything in our lives.”
The investors helped Feathr advertise 
the app to conference organizers rather than individuals. By downloading the smartphone app provided by conferenc-es, attendees will have the ability to cus-tomize their individual profiles, book-mark their favorite contacts and connect with speakers via social media.
Conference managers will have con-
trol to update scheduling and room as-signments instantly, according to the app’s website.
Augustin said the money was neces-
sary to continue to move forward and develop the app.
“For the first time, we are truly held 
accountable to people other than our-selves,” he said. “The investors are push-ing us to deliver, and that is great.”Former UF students get

After an application process and a two-week-
long public voting period, UF’s Shands Arts in 
Medicine program and the Shands Jacksonville Medical Center were named LIVESTRONG Foundation grant recipients last week.
Dr. Mark McIntosh, Shands Jacksonville In-
tegrative Palliative Care medical director, said the foundation will distribute about $1 million to 72 nation-wide organizations committed to supporting cancer patients and their families.
The Shands Arts in Medicine program in 
Gainesville will receive $15,000, which will go toward expanding and developing creativity workshops at the hospital, said Dylan Klemp-ner, graduate programs adviser.
As an artist-in-residence who holds two 
master’s degrees in fine arts, Klempner said he will facilitate the workshops and enhance a program he started in 2011 called The Mobile Inspiration Station. With his cart filled with art supplies, he gives cancer patients a chance to make paintings, write poems and play instru-ments at their bedside.
The $10,000 awarded to the Palliative Care 
program in Jacksonville will help the hospi-tal participate in the Joint Commission’s Ad-vanced Certification Program, which ensures a standard of quality across various hospitals, McIntosh said.
“We made a push and outreach to the 
Gainesville community to support our cause,” he said.The palliative care specialty grew out of the 
hospice movement. It provides psychosocial, spiritual, communication and symptom sup-port to patients of all ages diagnosed with life- threatening diseases.
McIntosh said the program at Shands Jack-
sonville has seen about 1,100 participants each year since it opened about three years ago.
“It’s not just about the high-tech. It’s about 
the high-touch as well,” McIntosh said. “We are very concerned about patient and family care.”
Sarah Johnson said Shands is doing a great 
job reaching out to cancer and palliative care patients. The 21-year-old UF linguistics junior has been involved with Streetlight at Shands for more than a year, which has allowed her to develop relationships with young adults bat-tling life-threatening illnesses.
Johnson was diagnosed with acute promy-
elocytic leukemia her junior year of high school and has been in remission for four years.
“Regardless of whether it’s me or another 
volunteer who isn’t a cancer survivor, the pa-tients and their families are just really happy that we took the time out of our day to hang out with them because all they really want is a sense of normalcy,” Johnson said.Shands wins LIVESTRONG grant

Musicians will find even more 
reasons to move their feet with new 
motion-sensor technology for their instruments.
Gainesville startup eMotion 
Technologies debuted its Kickstart-er campaign Monday in an effort to find a second round of beta testers. Kickstarter, an online crowdsourc-ing website, is popular among start-ups that seek funding.EMotion was 
founded in June 2011 by Chet Udell as his music composition the-sis for his Ph.D. at UF. He cre-ated the system to bring musical 
instrument technology to 2013.
The technology mimics Guitar 
Hero, a popular video game that uses motion sensors to match the player’s movements with actions on-screen.
The real-life version of this tech-
nology features a sensor hub that’s a little longer than a pack of cards. The hub communicates wirelessly with a variety of small sensors musicians attach directly to their instruments, said eMotion spokeswoman Van-essa Calas, a 21-year-old UF public relations junior.
The company’s Smart Instrument 
Control System allows musicians to create their own presets for sensors via partnered open-source software.The sensors measure different 
environmental conditions such as motion, humidity and pressure. Calas said the software allows the musician to use these cues to control factors such as lighting, drum tracks and guitar distortion.
“You can control your entire en-
vironment using movement,” she said. 
This technology has the ability 
to reduce the need for lighting and soundboard technicians by at least half, Calas said, making these addi-tions available to all musicians.
“We want this to be as accessible 
as possible to everyone,” she said.
Janae Lafleur, a 22-year-old first 
year UF costume design graduate student, worries this could be detri-mental to technicians’ careers.
Lafleur, who has played guitar 
since she was 13, also works as a sound and light technician.
“I think it would catch on for 
small venues,” she said, “but it would never be able to do what real light and sound technicians could.”

As Sarah Silverman 
strummed an acoustic guitar for 
the last line of her last song, all eyes were on Deborah Flagg.
A nervous smile was fixed on 
the sign language interpreter’s face as she searched for ways to sign the four-letter word for vagina Silverman sang dozens of times to close her act.   
The comedian, known for 
her TV show “The Sarah Silver-man Program,” performed for about 650 students and com-munity members at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Monday night as the finale to Pride Awareness Month.
Joking about politics, termi-nally ill babies and insecurities, Silverman touched on issues in an entertaining way, said Jessie Pincus, a 22-year-old UF ad-vertising senior and executive director of PAM.
“She really reached out to 
the female audience,” she said. “I think that’s something UF doesn’t get often.”
Bobby Brito, a 20-year-old 
UF political science sophomore, said he thought Silverman was a great choice because she’s an ally for the LGBT community.
Silverman, who was paid 
$50,000 for her appearance by Accent Speaker’s Bureau, Stu-dent Government Productions and PAM, told girls they were too used to falling into self-dep-recating thoughts.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgMonday’s question: Have you had the 
stomach ﬂ  u this year?Today’s question: Have you ever taken acid? 
For my last column, I wasn’t sure what to write about.
I knew I wanted to thank the people who tuned in 
on Tuesdays to read my column, so thank you for that. 
But something that happened this week changed the in-
tent of this column from a schmaltzy ‘everyone have a great 
summer’ piece into one last piss-and-vinegar rant.
Here’s what happened: I was working with a team of 
people and, after we had completed our task, a manager from the college blasted into the room looking upset, inter-rupted our meeting, and angrily began to point out mistakes we had made.
Which is one thing.But the thing that rankled me was in the beginning of ev-
ery few sentences, he would start with the words, “Now, I’m not upset but …”
As in, “I’m not upset, but I am very pissed off.” Or, “I’m 
not upset. I am just disappointed in all of you.” Halfway through, it made me start wondering what in the world he was interpreting the words “not upset” to mean, because in every other deﬁ  nition, he was hitting the mark.
If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a 
duck, don’t try to tell me it’s not a duck.
Why couldn’t he just admit to being upset?Nowadays, emotions are seen as a weakness in business. 
To be a leader, you must always be calm and collected, ra-tional in punishment and conservative in praise. And to be hurt, embarrassed or angry is “not a strong moment” or an overreaction, and only a thick skin and an “it’s not personal, it’s just business” attitude will take you to the top.
Find me a man or woman who can separate themselves 
that far from their emotions in their line of work, and I will present you with the world’s last unicorn.
So clearly those are impossible standards, but it doesn’t 
stop people from trying to follow them. Emotions aren’t things you can lock down, and they just come back in various passive-aggressive mannerisms. Often, this makes a reaction that could be reasonable and expected seem totally ridicu-lous.
I have named it the “I’m Not 
Mad, You’re Just Stupid” argu-ment.
If I wrote about sexism, dis-
crimination and social controver-sies every week and then said, “I never get angry about this stuff. I just want to show the world how low-brow and ridiculous it’s be-
ing,” how much of a total jerk would I sound like? To act like you are not personally invested in your own reactions and words is a complete crock of bull, so at the very least, people should admit to them.
Embarrassment might be the most potent starter of the 
“I’m Not Mad, You’re Just Stupid” argument because no one likes admitting they are embarrassed.
If you are in an argument with someone and getting an 
unreasonable amount of heat thrown your way, mentally check to see if something happened to cause the other person embarrassment.  
For my one last stand on the soap box, remember that 
emotions and rationality are not mutually exclusive occur-rences, and the preference for one over the other doesn’t make a good leader. 
Good leaders use emotions to fuel their drive and use 
logic to pick out the battles worth ﬁ  ghting.
And if you get upset, a lot of the time it’s better to say it, so 
at least people know where you are coming from.
Tina Fey has a hilarious quote: “Some people say ‘Never 
let them see you cry.’ I say, if you’re so mad you could just cry, then cry. It terriﬁ  es everyone.”
Good luck to all the seniors going out into the workplace. To everyone else, see you in Fall.

James Toth on suspicion of drunken driving,” reported Reuters.
“In a statement released late Sunday, the American actress 
said she could not go into detail about what happened, citing legal reasons,” continued the report. “But she added: ‘I do want to say I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embar-rassed about the things I said,’ Witherspoon said in the state-ment. ‘It was deﬁ  nitely a scary situation and I was frightened for my husband, but that was no excuse. I was disrespectful to the ofﬁ  cer who was just doing his job. I have nothing but respect for the police and I am very sorry for my behavior.’”
Yeah, but what was her behavior?“Do you know my name?” she asked the cop who arrested 
her, according to the Los Angeles Times, after she got in the way of her husband’s drunken driving arrest. “You’re about to ﬁ  nd out who I am.”
We already know who you are, Reese Witherspoon. You’re 
Reese Witherspoon. You’re America’s sweetheart. You’re “Le-gally Blonde.” You’re “Water for Elephants.” You’re “Walk the Line.” You’re “Sweet Home Alabama.” You’re the mother of a child who you named Tennessee. You can do anything (for love). But you can’t do that.
“It’s a terrible thing to happen to someone with this sort of 
image. She’s not 22. She’s a mother of three. Thank God they didn’t kill someone. It’s a perfect storm of terrible: the time of night, the way she’s reported to have behaved, and her using celebrity as a way out,” said Janice Min, the editor-in-chief of the “Hollywood Reporter,” according to an article by USA Today.
“After playing a series of spunky ladies in upbeat ﬁ  lms, With-
erspoon was the latest actress to be anointed America’s sweet-heart, on the heels of Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts,” continued the article. “Yet in person, none of the three are sweetness and light. Ryan is quiet and introverted, Roberts has a biting wit to her and doesn’t suffer fools.”
Suffer fools? Yeah, no one wants to suffer fools. That sounds 
awful.
We hate entitlement, even when our favorite celebrities uti-
lize it. Maybe even especially when celebrities do it.
Let’s learn some lessons, folks, yet again from celebrities act-
ing awful: they’re just like us.
1. Don’t get a tattoo, especially if it reads “YOLO.”2. Verify all your information from your celebrity Twitter ac-
count ﬁ  rst.
3. Don’t pierce your cheeks, Amanda Bynes. It makes you 
look more crazy than you actually are.
4. Don’t ever ask people if they know who you are. They most 
likely do, if you’re a celebrity. The law just doesn’t care.
We can do it, guys. If this is what the future looks like, ac-
cording to our role models, then we’re doing just ﬁ  ne. We can hang in there just a few more days until we’re done with ﬁ  nals, exams and graduations if it means we’ll end up as well-rounded individuals by the end of it.

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, APRIL 23, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
I     hadn’t talked to my mom in a while, and she, being the 
good mom she is, checked in with me. After a bit of a back and forth, the conversation ended with “glad to 
know that you’re OK.”
I don’t know if “OK” is the right word for now. Not 
after the 2013 Boston Marathon.
We’ve experienced tragedies before, but this one 
seemed to strike deeper.
Part of it was that this was in Boston. Not New York 
City, the ethnic melting pot that symbolizes America’s 
diversity. It wasn’t Washington, D.C., our capital and governmental base of operations. In the words of John Tlumacki, the photographer who took what will prob-ably end up as the iconic image of this tragedy display-
ing three ofﬁ  cers mobilizing as a runner was on the ground, “I think it’s haunting to see: this is Boston, this is Liberty. All of this happening with all the ﬂ  ags of the nations. Here are people — a pile of injured people — just laying in front of these ﬂ  ags.”
It didn’t just hit our tradition 
of 117 marathons, though. It hit us in sports, one of our refuges from the real world. We use these events to get away from the doom and gloom of everyday life. Sport-ing events across Boston were canceled in response.
Statistically, three deaths and 183 hospitalizations is 
tame compared to the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing (168 dead, hundreds more injured), but that is neither here nor there. Comparing tragedies just seems crass and disrespectful right now.
But we’re going to.And at the same time we’ll politicize this, just like all 
the other tragedies. 
Some of us already have. For all we know, it may 
have been politicized from the start. Once the story about the story completes its course, we’ll ﬁ  le it away, using bits and snippets from it to bolster whatever side of a debate we’re on.
I always end up coming back to the idea it was a 
sporting event. The main phrase that has been running through my head the past few days is “it’s not sup-posed to happen here. Not to us,” as if our sports are sacred. I probably got that idea from growing up in the South, where college football is just as much a religion as any traditional denomination is.
That’s what attacks like these are supposed to do, 
though. 
They shake our beliefs and challenge our convic-
tions. We hesitate and allow doubt to creep in.
So what now?Obviously the answer is “move on,” but how do 
we go about it? We insult those killed and injured if we don’t change security levels, but we risk losing the escape if there are constant reminders of the big bad world. 
Maybe we should just end our collective suspension 
of disbelief. All of the concussion issues have started that process when it comes to football. It might just be a matter of time until that extends to all of our sports.
Then I look at the Olympic Games. I look at interna-
tional soccer. They’ve gone through extremist attacks. The Olympics and the World Cup are the two big-gest sporting draws today despite the risks such large events pose.
We’ll get past this, and we’ll become better citizens, 
fans and people, whether it’s because of or in spite of this ordeal. 
Any other result is the most disrespectful outcome 
of all.

the Boston tragedyColumn
As a semi-withdrawn gay man, I have never had 
the urge to open an account with Grindr, a so-cial networking app tailored to the male-oriented 
orientations of the LGBTQ spectrum. With the help of Grindr, a gay, bi or bi-curious man can connect with the greater community geosocially, by literally locating oth-er like-minded men within a close proximity to the user. Even though, in my opinion, the prospect of meeting my soulmate with the help of a cellphone application seems less than appealing, Grindr has become quite the phe-nomenon, and many of my closest friends have proﬁ  les.
Unfortunately, in recent years, Grindr has, for the 
most part, become a way of meeting men for a cheap hookup, and it is this dating service of sorts that brought to light a norm in the gay community that I had not actu-ally considered, despite the fact that this malignant cus-tom has touched my life over the years.
Last month, a friend of mine gave me a tour of Grin-
dr, and, to my horror, I stumbled across many proﬁ  les that, when describing their perfect match, read “no femmes.”
This phrase got me thinking about my life and the 
presence of homophobia within the gay community that is largely geared toward those who exhibit more “femi-nine tendencies.”
Although it is, in many ways, human nature to apply 
a hierarchical component to people or things, this sort of discrimination is unacceptable, and, frankly, unhelpful to the cause of equality.
Yet, this hateful rhetoric is not just present in the 
Grindr community, but in the greater gay community as well.
This issue of internalized homophobia not only un-
earths the presence of harmful hierarchies within a sub-jugated group, but also begs the question: Why are fe-male characteristics seen as less desirable in every facet of life?
The notion of hegemonic masculinity, or the Western 
perception that there is a singular, true type of mascu-linity upon which all other constructions are measured, leaves every other group — women, many ethnic mi-norities and a large chunk of the homosexual commu-nity — subjugated without warrant.
Thus, those men who display characteristics that do 
not fall within this narrow view of masculinity are dis-criminated against by those who see themselves as rep-resentative of the archetypal masculinity, even if those men are gay.
Unfortunately, this notion of untarnished, societally 
acceptable masculinity trumps group solidarity, leav-ing a diverse sphere like the gay community fragmented and ridden with animosity. As a feminine gay man, I am able to provide a couple of instances in which this discrimination has affected my life and the way in which I view myself.
Ever since I was young, I have exhibited many char-
acteristics that most would deem “feminine.” I have a high-pitched voice, a slight build, and my mannerisms are anything but masculine. Thus, this discrimination, albeit subtle, has touched my life in more than a few tangible ways. I have been told on count-less occasions that I am just too “feminine,” and my potential mate was looking for someone 
with a bit “more strength and manly vigor.” (Yes, that is a quote.)
Yet, whenever I encountered phrases like these, I 
never considered the terrible damage it was doing sub-consciously. These vile words negatively affected my self-esteem as a newly initiated member of the LGBTQ community, and I imagine these discriminatory slurs have the same effect on other gay teens who are looking for acceptance, particularly among other LGBTQ youth.
I think, psychologically, I understood their critiques. 
I mean, why would a guy want to be with a man who is nurturing, patient and gentle? In many ways, I agreed with their criticisms. This sort of thinking is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this entire practice: These boys and men receive so much ﬂ  ak from almost all cor-ners of society due to their nonconformist qualities, and to also be diminished by those within the community with which you identify can be devastating. I am lucky enough to be able to internalize all the hate I encounter every day — from those within and without my commu-nity — however, some are not so thick skinned.
In my mind, the best way to combat this norm is to 
understand that the gay community is completely dif-ferent when compared to the straight community. Thus, the qualities that are associated with a straight relation-ship should not be superimposed upon a gay partner-ship.
Men do not have to be strong and reserved, and there 
does not need to be a “male” partner and a “female” partner. Perhaps the most infuriating question I receive from others about my sexuality is, “So, are you the wom-an in the relationship?” I mean, for heck’s sake, I am not looking to be in a conventional male-female-style rela-tionship. That is why I am gay. Therefore, it is our duty, as gay men and women, to educate people, to help them understand we are an extremely diverse community, brimming with feminine people and masculine people and everything in between. This educating process must start from within.
If we want others to accept us for who we are, we 
must accept each other ﬁ  rst.
This internal discrimination is not only harmful to 
one’s self worth, but it also affects how the gay commu-nity is perceived by those that do not use an L, G, B, T or Q to describe their sexuality.
To borrow a quote from the ever beautiful and exceed-
ingly wise RuPaul of “Drag Race” fame: “If you don’t love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else?” And with the burgeoning practice of discrimina-tion from within the gay community, I think this quote has never been timelier.

UF engineering freshman Joe Liccini, 19, exercises at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Monday. Accord-
ing to a study, walking can lower people’s risk of high blood pressure as much as running can. 
CAITLIN RADDATZ

She no longer searches for close 
parking spaces.
After her heart attack in July, Kelly 
Reid, a UF College of Nursing program 
assistant, understands the importance of walking.
Now, she makes sure to walk at least 
15 minutes daily.
“Walking is less stressful on our bod-
ies, yet I think it’s doing the same thing as running,” she said. “Walking benefits you. It reduces your stress level.”
Reid is right.Walking can lower people’s risk of 
high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes as much as running, ac-cording to an American Heart Associa-tion journal.
Apart from previous studies, re-
searchers assessed 15,045 walkers and 33,060 runners, aged 18 to 80 years old, by distance instead of time.
Researchers found the same energy 
used for moderate-intensity walking and vigorous-intensity running re-sulted in similar reductions in risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and possibly coronary heart disease.
Melody Schiaffino, a third-year UF 
health services research doctoral stu-dent, is familiar with the data released by the association. She said the infor-mation is positive, but there are no baseline characteristics, which make up an individual’s starting point.
“If you’re looking at this, you would 
think that walking is better than run-ning,” she said, “and that is not neces-sarily the case.”
Runners are getting twice as much 
exercise, but running is also harder.  
Either way, Schiaffino said, there has 
been an increase in good health for ei-ther group.
“It’s a win-win, really,” she said. New study shows benefits of walking for heart disease

MICHELLE LEUTE

Dangerous bacteria like Salmonella, 
Listeria, Staph and E. coli were found on 
beer pong balls by Clemson University students in the Fall, according to The As-sociated Press. It was found that bacteria from the balls ended up in the beer.The students who conducted the study 
found 3 million bacteria on beer pong balls from outdoor games and 200 bacteria on balls from games played on carpet.
Michele Headley, a 22-year-old UF 
health science senior, said she’s only played the game a few times.
Headley said when she played beer 
pong, players would have cups full of beer and a water cup to rinse the ball off when it fell on the ground. 
She said she found the process stupid 
because there would still be tons of bacte-ria in the water cup.
Unlike Headley, Pedro Macellaro plays 
beer pong more frequently.
The 21-year-old UF industrial and sys-
tems engineering senior said he plays at least twice a month.
Macellaro said he thinks playing out-
side is healthier than playing indoors be-cause grass might have less bacteria than carpet.
Macellaro doesn’t dwell on the bacteria 
too much, though.
“Sometimes, you just have to forget 
about it to have fun,” he said. Beer pong can lead to more than hangovers, study finds“Walking is less stressful on 
our bodies, yet I think it’s doing 
the same thing as running.”

◗ SEVEN STUDENTS WILL 
REPRESENT THE SCHOOL.
KATIE BURNS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A group of P.K. Yonge De-
velopmental Research School 
students will face off against more than 800 teams from about 25 countries to solve tough problems in the most cre-ative manner possible.
Seven students will travel 
to Michigan State University to compete in the Odyssey of the Mind World Finals from May 22 to May 25.
J. L. Kirby, a social stud-ies teacher and head coach of the team, said he liked how the school’s program teaches students collaboration and cre-ative thinking. He added the philosophy of the competition 
fits well with the nature of the school.
“I think 
P.K. has a lot of advantag-es,” he said. “There’s a 
big push on math and 
sciences, which is part of the [program], and also places a large push on the arts that some schools don’t have.”Each team is judged on its 
creativity in solving various technical problems, such as building structures in an eight-minute skit. The teams have a limited $125 to $145 budget for props and building materi-als. The teams are also given a spontaneous problem to solve, which are much shorter than the eight minutes for skits.
Joey McGinn, a 16-year-old 
P.K. Yonge sophomore and first-year member of the team,  said he likes how the program teaches different perspectives when tackling a problem.
“There’s always going to be 
another way to look at it,” he said.

Some UF web services were down 
for two hours Monday.
The password reset service and 
myinvestiGator, which allows faculty 
to submit research reports for federal and state grants, experienced an out-age. MyUFL’s finance module, which oversees CASHNet and student mod-ules, was also down. All services were restored by 1:20 p.m.
UF Information Technology Com-
munications Manager Tracy Gale said the HTML code was not loading cor-rectly for the finance module’s pages. Anyone who was trying to make a pay-ment through CASHNet encountered problems. The information, however, was displayed correctly.
“Nobody saw a bill for $1,000 when 
it was just $10,” she said.
Gale said the disruption came from 
something that went wrong during regular system maintenance Sunday morning, but she doesn’t yet know what specifically caused the outage.
Associate Controller for UF’s Bur-
sar Ruth Harris noticed the CASH-Net system wasn’t working Monday morning. She said she did not receive any complaints from students or fac-ulty about the outage.

 The 2012 NCAA Champion-
ships came down to the ﬁ  nal rou-
tine for the Gators in Duluth, Ga.
  Kytra Hunter needed to com-
plete her ﬂ  oor exercise. Her score would determine the fate of Florida’s championship hopes. Hunter’s score of 9.925 gave her team a slim point advantage at the competition’s end. 
  But as the Gators waited for 
the ﬁ  nal results, Alabama re-sponded on balance beam, jump-ing .075 points ahead of Florida to win its second consecutive NCAA title. 
  On Saturday in Los Angeles, 
the Gators left nothing to chance, posting the highest team total on ﬂ  oor in NCAA history en route to its ﬁ  rst national championship. 
  In the weeks leading up to the 
postseason, coach Rhonda Faehn often referred to the ﬂ  oor lineup as a “project.” On Saturday, Flor-ida’s lineup combination played an integral role in the victory.   
  The Gators’ strong showing on 
the ﬂ  oor helped them overcome a shaky start. A poor opening score of 48.875 on balance beam put Florida in a hole.  
  “The mistakes that happened 
on beam were so uncharacter-istic,” Faehn said. “It was like, ‘What, what happened there?’ I don’t think it affected anyone other than making it harder. There was no looking back to anything in the past. Let’s go to ﬂ  oor, and let’s rally.”
  Prior to the NCAA Champi-
onships, UF was one of the na-tion’s top-scoring teams on ﬂ  oor exercise, posting scores of 49.65 and 49.625 at the NCAA Region-als and Southeastern Conference Championships, respectively.
  The Gators are 4-0 this season when scoring 49.6 or higher on ﬂ  oor.
  After a poor start on beam, a 
shaky leadoff routine from Ja-mie Shisler on ﬂ  oor spelled early trouble.
  Bridget Sloan alleviated some 
of Florida’s anxiety by following with a 9.95 performance. Three Gators turned in or equaled col-lege ﬂ  oor bests on Saturday. Bridgette Caquatto earned a 9.95, and Kytra Hunter posted a 9.975. Dickerson also earned a 9.9 and King rounded out the lineup, scored a 9.95.
  Florida’s 49.725 ﬂ  oor total set 
an NCAA Championships re-cord.
  “We just control what’s in 
front of us,” Faehn said. “This team doesn’t look to [mistakes], and does not get caught up in those things. It’s just about what’s in front of them and what they can do.”

 Stephanie Tofft transferred 
from Northern Illinois to Flor-
ida before the season, hoping to make a splash with her new team. She didn’t. 
  The junior started off the 
season hot before descending into a cold streak that saw her batting average fall as low as .228.
  But after No. 3 Florida’s (45-
5, 14-4 Southeastern Confer-ence) sweep of Longwood last weekend, Tofft is the Gators’ hottest hitter.
  Tofft  
went 8 for 10 at the plate with 
three home runs, two doubles and a triple. She drove in nine of Florida’s 22 runs during the weekend.
  “It’s been a while since I’ve 
felt like this,” Tofft said. “I re-ally just saw the ball well this weekend.”
  Tofft was not used to failing 
at the college level. She hit .434 her freshman year and .379 as a sophomore. But Tofft strug-gled to adjust to the tougher schedule Florida faced and is still batting only .240 in SEC play.
  “The beginning of the year 
was deﬁ  nitely rough for me,” Tofft said. “I was getting really frustrated.”
  But recently, Tofft has 
turned a corner.
  After going 0 for 2 against 
Mississippi State on April 6, her batting average fell to .259. Since then she is 16 for 29 — good for a .552 average.
She is slugging 1.069 in the 
past nine games, raising her season slugging percentage to .582.

against Longwood, Tofft is   Junior

twitter: @joshjurnovoy  The UF baseball team has every right to 
be pleased.
  In 15 days, the Gators went from 
four games under .500 to three games above .500 and now sit in third place in the South-eastern Conference Eastern Division.
  But there is reason for concern.  Jonathon Crawford isn’t coming to the 
rescue.
  Sure, the junior right-hander has been in 
the weekend rotation throughout the sea-son. At times, he has also shown the domi-nant arm that everyone expected to anchor Florida’s staff prior to this season.
  The productivity of the Gators’ starting 
pitching staff in 2012 mirrors that of 2013 in some areas but not others.
  Through 41 games this season, Florida starters have thrown 181.3 of the 376 in-nings, which is good for 48.2 percent. At the same point in 2012, the numbers were almost identical, as the start-ers had thrown two 
more innings in two more innings played for 48.4 percent of innings thrown. 
  On the surface, this would seem to indi-
cate that the Gators are getting a comparable performance, but that isn’t quite the case.
  At the 41-game mark last season, Florida 
had gotten three starts of three innings or fewer — two of which were 0.2 and one in-ning long — from sophomore Karsten Whit-son, who struggled with injuries for most of the year. Eventually, Crawford started getting opportunities on the weekends with Whitson sidelined and was dominant down the stretch. He ﬁ  nished the season with a 3.13 ERA and struck out 73 batters in 77.2 innings. 
  Crawford’s starts in the second half of 
2012 included a no-hitter against Bethune-Cookman in the NCAA Tournament and six shutout innings in a regular-season outing against LSU.
  Those are the type of efforts the Gators 
aren’t getting on a regular basis this year.
  Florida starters have combined for just 
three quality starts when the pitcher goes at least six innings and gives up three runs or fewer — this season. Freshmen Danny Young 
 Florida needs more innings from starting staff and Jay Carmichael have each had starts 
where they went 5.1 innings with no runs or 5.2 innings with one run, but Crawford is the only starter to throw a quality start this season, and he has just three. No one else has even gone six innings in a start.  
In 2012, the Gators had twice that number of quality starts through only 19 games. At this point, they had three different starters combine to throw eight quality starts.
Thus, there was reason to believe there 
would be more of those starts later in the year as Crawford got more consistent time.
Carmichael, who had a stretch where 
he gave up just three runs in 16.1 innings before a mediocre start against Ole Miss and an arm injury, could still return to form, but he wouldn’t be joining two pitchers as experienced and effective as Brian Johnson and Hudson Randall as Crawford did a year ago.
Bobby Poyner has started the last two 
midweek games — both UF wins — and will likely get the nod again tonight as Florida (22-19) hosts USF (26-14) at 7. Poyner went four innings against FSU and 5.1 against FGCU and gave up one run in each outing. 
If Poyner can continue to stretch him-
self out and the other starters do the same, the Gators might avoid working their bullpen to death before postseason play.

alligator.org.second on the team in bat-ting average for the season at .319. She is also second in RBI with 43.
“She had a great week,” 
coach Tim Walton said. “I haven’t seen a hitter have a week like that with the pow-er she’s displayed and the number of RBIs.”
Tofft hit mainly for av-
erage at Northern Illinois, launching only eight home runs in her two years in DeKalb, Ill.
But she showed off her 
power against Longwood last weekend, hitting three hom-ers, including one that was headed for Museum Road beyond the outfield fence. The ball was stopped by the top of a tree.
“She hit a couple mam-
moth home runs,” Walton said.
“One to the opposite field, 
one to the pull side.”
Tofft fell just a single short 
of the cycle in Game 2 of the Gators’ series against the Lancers.
She got the hardest hits 
out of the way first, hitting a double, a home run and a triple in her first three at bats. Tofft came up in the sixth inning and hit one back to pitcher Ashley Cornell. Cor-nell threw home to get Au-bree Munro at the plate try-ing to score, allowing Tofft to reach first with a fielder’s choice, ending her chance for a cycle.“I didn’t even think about 
that,” Tofft said, “but I guess that would’ve been cool.”
After playing for two Hus-
kies teams that went a com-bined 45-61, Tofft is glad to be playing for a contending team for the first time.
Florida is currently the 
top team in the SEC and is 
poised to make a deep post-
season run with Tofft hitting the way she is as the starting third baseman.
“It’s amazing to be part of 
a team that is so competitive and likes to win so much,” Tofft said.

Noami Santos-Lamb is healthy and ready 
to get going.
In two years at Florida, one of PrepVol-
leyball.com’s former Senior Aces has yet to 
show off her talent during the course of an entire season. She spent the majority of her freshman season on the bench, and a torn ACL ended her sophomore season prema-turely.
After surgery and months of rehab, San-
tos-Lamb is back.
“Noami Santos-Lamb is really close to 
being completely cleared,” coach Mary Wise said. “She’s back on the court in a lim-ited capacity, but she is back on the court in closed drills. She’s allowed to jump and hit.”
Now healthy, Santos-Lamb aims to fol-
low in the footsteps of the players that kept her on the bench as a freshman. Santos-Lamb was one of three outside hitters on Florida’s roster in 2011. The other two were seniors Kristy Jaeckel and Stephanie Ferrell.
Jaeckel, an All-American, and Ferrell 
missed only three sets combined all sea-son. The duo tallied 651 kills between them, leading Florida to a 27-6 record and an Elite Eight appearance. Santos-Lamb struggled to crack the lineup, recording 11 kills in only 20 sets during her freshman season.Jaeckel, Ferrell and four other Gators left 
Florida following the 2011 season, open-ing the door for Santos-Lamb to become a fixture in the Gators’ lineup. Wise had the sophomore penciled in as one of Florida’s 
starting outside hit-ters after a promis-ing offseason.
“You come in 
with the mindset of working hard and try-ing to earn the spot to start,” Santos-Lamb said August 16. “You just have to go out there and give it your all. You get out of it what you put into it.”
However, Santos-Lamb’s efforts to make 
a bigger impact as a sophomore fell through when she suffered an ACL tear in her left knee during an intra-squad scrimmage on August 18. Eight days before the Gators’ 2012 season opener, Santos-Lamb was rel-egated to the sidelines.
“[Santos-Lamb] had an awesome spring 
and stayed here the entire summer,” Wise said on August 27. “She was lighting it up and by far the best player on the court dur-ing that scrimmage.”
In Santos-Lamb’s absence, Ziva Recek 
emerged as a playmaker at outside hitter last season. She was named AVCA Fresh-man of the Year and Southeastern Confer-ence Freshman of the Year after leading Florida with 440 kills in 2012.
With Recek and Santos-Lamb both in the lineup, Wise is happy with what she has at outside hitter.
“Every indication is that come August, 
when we start August 10, that Noami will be back on the court, which is really good news,” Wise said.

The Gators made unexpected 
history on Saturday at Dizney Sta-
dium.
No. 2 Florida defeated the de-
fending national champion North-western 22-4.
The four goals marked the 
lowest-scoring output from the Wildcats in 10 years and the most lopsided loss ever suffered by Northwestern.
“I did not expect that to hap-
pen,” coach Amanda O’Leary said.
With Florida’s first-ever recruit-
ing class playing its final regular season home game, emotions were high. But the Gators’ adrenaline turning into an 18-goal drubbing of the fourth-ranked Wildcats was a surprising twist. 
“It’s just a testament to all of 
our seniors how we played on Sat-urday,” O’Leary 
said.
Senior Brit-
tany Dashiell added after the game: “I keep on telling myself, ‘Did we really just win by 18 goals? This must 
be a dream.’”
The Gators’ performance earned 
them the No. 1 overall seed in the American Lacrosse Conference tournament that begins on May 2 in Baltimore.
“That was awesome,” senior 
defender Sam Farrell said. “We all came out with such fire de-termined on our last regular sea-son home game on this field. We weren’t leaving with a loss.”
Although Saturday’s blowout 
surprised some, O’Leary said her team set a new standard.
“It would be really nice to see that performance each and every game,” O’Leary said. “I think now that we saw it, it is possible to ex-pect it.”
Florida’s 13 seniors will be criti-
cal in sustaining that high level of play.
The seniors have combined to 
score 157 of the team’s 265 goals this season — 59 percent of the team’s offensive output.
