Former senator
talks health care
0 DASCHLE STRESSED THE
IMPORTANCE OF REFORM.
ByCJ PRUNER

For former Sen. Tom Daschle,
who served as majority leader
and is an expert on health care
policy, the number one serves as
a reminder of how far the United
States has to go in its quest to re-
form the health care system.
"We're the No. 1 country in
terms of (health care) costs and
37th in outcome," Daschle said in
a speech Tuesday evening in Pugh
Hall. "We need to rise to the chal-
lenge."
Daschle spoke to a crowd of
250 and outlined the issues of the
health care debate.
He discussed topics including
the extent of the government's role
in health care reform and the coststo~CY~I!x

associated with reform.
Daschle labeled the differing
viewpoints in the health care de-
bate as the "noise of democracy"
and said both sides share blame in
the failure to achieve a true biparti-
san approach to health reform.
"We're the No. 1 country

Students get Reitz fee vote
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Senators discussed giving a voice to UF
students on a potential Reitz Union fee and at
Tuesday night's Senate meeting.
The Student Senate unanimously passed
a bill that will put a question about the Reitz
Union expansion fee on the Student Govern-
ment spring election ballot.
The proposed question has two parts.
It asks students whether a fee should be im-
plemented, and, if so, whether it should cover
expansion and repairs.
Senators amended the bill to include more
information about how the fee will be used.
Unite Party Sen. Alex Masi, who represents
the Rawlings area, presented the amendment
to the original bill.
He said rephrasing the question makes it
clear for students what the fee will be going
toward."The hands-down goal of this is to help stu-
dents understand what's going on," Masi said.
The new version of the question tells vot-
ers the Reitz Union is more than 40 years old,
needs an estimated $40 million in repairs and
was originally built for only 19,000 students.
Progress Party Sen. Matt Vernon, who rep-
resents graduate students,
said the background infor-
mation is useful for voters,
and the referendum ques-
tion requires two different
parts.
Orange and Blue Part
Sen. Jon Ossip, who repre-Charles sents the Murphree Com-
mon Area, said the information about the Reitz
Union should be supplemented by information
about the additional financial burden the fee
will place on graduate students and students at
satellite campuses.

NATIONAL
Student leaders weigh in on Obama's first year
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Today marks President Obama's first
year in office, and UF political groups
have differing views on how his term is
going.
Bryan Griffin, UF College Republicans
executive director, said the president's
stimulus was poorly designed.
Florida College Democrats President
Ben Cavataro disagrees.
"The administration's quick action
averted a deeper recession," Cavataro
said.
In the last year, Obama signed a $787
billion stimulus bill, managed two wars,
presided over a health care brawl, avoided
a Christmas terrorist attack and respond-
ed to one of the worst natural disasters in
the Western Hemisphere.
And all the action has cost him in the
polls. A year ago, Obama saw an ap-
proval rating of more than 60 percent on
Real Clear Politics' national polling aver-
age. Today, he has a rating lower than 50
percent.
The St. Petersburg Times' Obameter,
which tracks the president's campaign
promises, says Obama has kept 91 of
those promises, compromised on 33 and
failed on 14.
Many of those 91 fulfilled promises
deal with the stimulus bill passed in Feb-
ruary. In addition to giving states funding
to fill their budget gaps, the stimulus bill
also included funding for high-speed rail,
green-energy job training and extended
unemployment insurance.Obama also kept his promise to refo-
cus on Afghanistan when he issued an
order in February to send two additional
brigades to the country.
At the time of Obama's inauguration,
there were about 34,000 American troops
in Afghanistan. Today there are more
than double that number, according to the
Department of Defense.
Furthering his deployment of troops,
Obama announced inDecember he would
be sending an additional 30,000 soldiers to
bring the total to about 100,000 troops.
Cavataro and Griffin agreed the presi-
dent was doing a good job in Afghani-
stan, but Griffin added
he hoped the president
would fulfill all of the
war's requirements.
One major promise
made during the cam-
paign was not to raise
taxes on families mak-
Obama ing less than $250,000.
Obama compromised
on this promise when he signed an excise
cigarette tax increase to help pay for the
State Children's Health Insurance Pro-
gram.
Cavataro said this is a stretch to call
it a tax on the middle class. He said he
believes if health care reform passes, the
middle class will actually save money.
Griffin disagreed, saying the middle
class and the rich both need tax cuts.
"They're forgetting about the people
who support the entitlement programs,"
Griffin said. "People making over $250,000
need tax cuts as well."
Of the 14 campaign promises Obamahas broken, according to the St. Peters-
burg Times, one of them was broken with
the flick of a pen early in his presidency.
Obama said he would post non-emer-
gency bills on the White House Web site
for five days of public comment before
signing them, but he broke this promise
with his first piece of legislation.
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was
signed by the president just two days
after being passed by Congress and was
never posted on the White House Web
site as Obama promised.
Recently, Republicans have criticized
Obama for breaking his promise to tele-
vise health care negotiations on C-SPAN.
Two deals brokered with the phar-
maceutical industry and hospitals were
behind closed doors, and the House-Sen-
ate conference to merge health care bills
won't be open to the public either.
Griffin blamed Speaker of the House
Nancy Pelosi for these broken promises.
"A lot of those had to do with the way
Pelosi operates," Griffin said. "I think
Obama caved in to Pelosi and [Senate Ma-
jority Leader Harry] Reid."
Cavataro said the bill that wasn't post-
ed on the Web site wasn't very controver-
sial and pointed to some of the tough rules
on lobbyist the White House has enacted
to make government more ethical.
While it's been a busy 365 days for the
44th U.S. president, Obama still has many
promises to keep during the next three
years.
Health care legislation is stalled in
Congress, and the president has yet to
repeal the army's "Don't Ask Don't Tell"
policy or pass a major energy bill.Ben Cavataro Bryan Griffin

Grant aims to keep civil
rights movement alive
By ERICA JOHNSON
Alligator Writer
As memories of the civil rights move-
ment begin to blur and tales of integration
fade with time, the Samuel Proctor Oral
History Program is striving to bring these
stories back into focus.
The program received a three-year,
$150,000 grant to collect and share stories of
local black residents who grew up during
the civil rights movement.
The grant was awarded by the UF Of-
fice of the Provost, and the project was de-
veloped after conversations between Paul
Ortiz, the program's director, and UF Presi-
dent Bernie Machen, according to a press
release.
Ortiz believes that as the number of
living black people who remember inte-
gration begins to dwindle, it is essential
to collect their stories before they are lost
forever, leaving only the history offered in
textbooks.
"History really matters to people as they
get older, and it isn't about facts and dates;
it's about feelings," Ortiz said.
He said the project focuses on oral his-
tories of black people who came of age
around the time of Brown vs. the Board of
Education in 1954.
"We want to see what the transition
was like in the everyday lives of blacks in
Gainesville and across the county," Ortiz
said.
He said the project's goal is to make theinformation collected in the interviews ac-
cessible to the public in the form of pod-
casts, Web sites and a book.
The podcasts can be accessed all over the
world on iTunes, with one listener in Bei-
jing, China, Ortiz said.
Transcripts from the interviews are on
the UF Digital Library Center Web site and
are already being used by students to write
term papers and reports, Ortiz said.
UF students play a huge role in the inter-
view process.
Of the 40 interviews
already conducted, two-
thirds of themwere done
by UF undergraduate
students, Ortiz said.
"They often say
things to me like, 'This
Ortiz interview changed my
life,"' he said. "They
say, 'I learned more about history in that
30-minute interview than I have in all the
textbooks I've read."'
Jason Horton, a sociology senior, was
nervous when he sat down to conduct his
first interview.
He spoke with the first black graduate of
the UF College of Nursing.
Horton said his two-hour conversation
with Evelyn Mickle helped him develop a
new appreciation for the challenges faced
by the pioneers of integration.
"Her strength and perseverance showed
me how my own struggles are so small," he
said.Cold threatens animals
I WEATHER SHOCK CAN CAUSE
ANIMALS TO FREEZE TO DEATH.
By TAYLOR DIXON
and ROBERT IMIFELD
Alligator Contributing Writers
This month's cold snap left its mark
on reptiles and bats all across Florida and
worried animal experts.
Cindi Marks, co-founder and executive
director of the Florida Bat Conservancy,
said some species of bats abundant in
Florida may not be able to withstand the
effects of the winter cold.
Jonathan Miot, assistant professor at
the Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo, said
iguanas, like other reptiles, are suffering
from cold shock.
"Due to the extraordinary cold weather
in Florida, the heat these animals are ab-
sorbing is not enough to sustain normal
metabolism," Miot said.
The slowing metabolism rate causes
reptiles to freeze. Although it is possible
for these animals to rebound from the cold
shock, sustained cold could cause them to
freeze to death, Miot said.
During extreme cold weather, the SFC
Teaching Zoo takes its animals indoors or
provides supplemental heat sources and
bedding. However, animals in the wild
aren't so lucky.
Bats essentially shut down during tor-
por, a phase similar to hibernation, begin-
ning with temperatures in the low 50s,
Marks said, and waking up from torpor tofind food consumes a lot of energy.
"There are no insects during the cold
weather, so the bats are staying in torpor
longer," Marks said.
On campus, the Brazilian free-tailed
bat is most at risk because it is a species na-
tive to more tropical climates and not used
to going into torpor for so long. The other
types of bats that live in the UF bat house
are native to the north.
"We really aren't totally sure how it
will affect these species," Marks said.
Florida bats go into torpor for a cou-
ple of weeks at a time, depending on the
temperature. The highest low in January
was 55, and the forecast
Local for the rest of January doesNews not show the lows rising
above 60, according to Ac-
cuWeather.com.
Including data from December 2009,
which did not show lows rising above 51
beginning Dec. 18, it is possible the bats
will face almost six consecutive weeks of
torpor-causing weather.
The bats in the UF bat house are doing
fine for now, said Ken Glover, pest man-
agement coordinator for UF.
"In previous times, I've had some bats
that would fall out," he said. He would
find them frozen on the ground near the
bat house.
UF sophomore Colleen Thomas said
she wants the warm weather to return
soon for her as well as the animals' sake.
"If I ever walked by the bat house and
saw a frozen bat on the ground, I would
scream," she said.

In the aftershocks of last week's
earthquake in Haiti, UF students
have rallied together to raise
funds and supplies to send to the
victims of the disaster.
Gators United for Haiti, a stu-
dent group originally founded in
2008 but reorganized following
the disaster, has united with UF
administrators to raise $50,000 to
send to the small, impoverished
Caribbean country.
So far, the umbrella organiza-
tion, which includes such groups
as Club Creole, Student Govern-
ment, Hope for Haiti and VISA,
has raised about $4,000.
"People started to see the
effects and then became
more willing to contribute."

Editorial
Blonde Moment
'Gossip Girl' star too
self-involved
It's been one week since the earthquake hit Haiti, and
people across the campus, country and world are joining
together to provide relief for those affected.
The Editorial Board is glad to see that celebrities are joining
in the effort too. Instead of buying Patron for their entourages
or cars for their mamas, they're putting the ridiculous sums of
money they receive for doing little to no work to good use.
We weren't surprised to hear Brangelina donated $1 million
to Doctors without Borders.
But we were quite pleased when we read George Clooney
and Wyclef Jean have stepped up to host Friday's "Hope for
Haiti Now" telethon.
Not to mention the all-star list of musicians who have signed
on to perform like Justin Timberlake, Rihanna and Bruce Spring-
steen (just to name a few).
However, some celebs have more important issues on their
minds -namely Taylor Momsen (you know, the really skinny
blonde girl who wears too much eye makeup and plays Jenny
Humphrey on the CW's "Gossip Girl").
During an interview with OK! Magazine, the reporter
asked her about her thoughts on the disaster and she replied
"Um, right now I'm trying to just finish my record and getting
through the last season of 'Gossip Girl' for right now. So not so
much thinking about that."
Now, if it were any other issue, the Editorial board would
defend "Gossip Girl" to its death (we do make the whole office
suffer through watching it every Monday), but not this time.
Momsen needs to get her act together and realize there are
more important things than her record, which will most likely
result in complete failure anyway. If you're going to make us
suffer through your wannabe rock star performance, at least do
it for a good cause.
Winter Warning
With winter settingin and word of
the FDA crack-
ing down on barely visible
tanning bed warnings, the
Editorial Board is urging
students to forgo sun-kissed
bronze in favor of pasty
white -or even Gators-
themed fake orange.
We know Floridians use
the term "winter" lightly, and
we don't expect you to hiber-
nate along with the sun, but
every year, it becomes more
evident that tanning is a care-
less practice.
According to an Associat-
ed Press article, the FDA final-
ly noticed that the warnings
on tanning beds are less than
menacing and is beginning to
explore stricter regulation of
tanning studios.
We're all for the crackdown
-we've Googled "melano-
ma," and it's not pretty.
The World Health Organi-zation found that the risk of
skin cancer jumps by about 5
percent when people use tan-
ning beds in their teens and
20s. Sure, there's a chance the
data is skewed or it's all a big
conspiracy, but do you re-

UF should not require health insurance
fter my father lost his job in November 2008, myfamily's health insurance coverage lapsed. Al-
though he found work -and, consequently, cov-
erage for himself -in April, the rest of the family can't
join until March 2010. So, for the only year my mother
and I have ever been without insurance, we have tiptoed
through our lives, avoiding what health risks we could.
My mother rationed out her thyroid medication at the ex-
pense of her memory and happy temperament. I stockpiled
over-the-counter pain relievers and cough suppressants in
case I had to ride out an influenza storm. It never came. In-
stead, a week before fall classes started, I felt stabbing pains
in my abdomen, which a walk-in clinic doctor diagnosed as
either appendicitis or pain from a cyst. Against my will and
money-driven mentality, I went to the ER for a night and left
with a bill for $18,000 in my name. That didn't include sur-
gery. The doctors wouldn't perform any but the most imper-
ative (lifesaving) operations on someone without insurance.
Perhaps you can see how walking around campus with a
10-centimeter cyst would tune me into the rumblings of re-
quired health insurance for UF students.
While shocking to students still on their parents' plans or
with insurance through work, a chunk of the Student Body
goes without insurance each year. In fact, estimates by the
Student Health Care Center and UF surveys indicate the
number of uninsured students is somewhere between 10,000
and 15,000. Why would all of these people take the risk of
not buying health insurance, especially when the university
provides a discounted policy? Much of this 20 to 30 percent
of the Student Body is comprised of stereotypical starving
students. We just can't afford it.
With phrases like "7 percent annual increase in college
costs" flying around, I checked the math. Accounting for my
normal spending, a purchase of the comprehensive Aetna
plan offered through the school would result in a 20 to 25
percent increase in costs. Of course, this calculation appliesCynthia Despres to my own situation.
Speaking Out Faced with a spike in costs, stu-
dents on an already tight budget
would have to choose to leave the
college, take out a (second) loan or get a (second) job. These
options stink.
Beyond the payment problem, the argument for mandat-
ing health insurance is on shaky ground to begin with: Why
would medical bills cause students to drop out of college?
Yes, collectors ask for bills to be paid, and the sums inflate to
massive amounts when not negated by insurance. However,
unlike with other payments, the collectors don't demand the
bills be paid immediately. With the burden of time lifted, a
medical bill acts almost like a student loan: Most collectors
are satisfied if the patient makes plans to pay the debt.
Even if everyone can scrounge up money to pay for in-
surance, I have problems with the proposal. Although pre-
existing conditions don't affect all Gators, they cause kinks in
the argument for mandated insurance. As I know from expe-
rience, obtaining an insurance plan covering known condi-
tions can prove exhausting. My mother called around to sign
me up for a plan immediately after my hospital visit. She was
prepared to spend money we didn't have to guarantee an
operation, but while the insurance companies would readily
take the cash, they wouldn't provide funds for surgery.
If forced into health insurance, people with pre-existing
conditions -which can range from asthma and high blood
pressure to cancer and heart disease -maybe denied cover-
age for their worst medical problems.
In spite of the unanswered questions, kudos goes to Stu-
dent Body President Jordan Johnson for understanding this
predicament and the widespread impact it could have on the
Student Body. Everyone should fight for what's right for this
university. Required health insurance could make our school
more exclusive on a financial basis rather than on an academ-
ic one, and that's not what the Gator Nation stands for.

Ignoring local church is the only solution
In response to Paul Murty's column:
Thank you for your intelligent column on Fri-
day about ignoring the Dove World Outreach
Center members when they preach intoler-
antly on campus.
I agree with you completely; ignoring
them is the only way to be rid of them. I am
not a Christian, but I know the teachings of
Jesus include much about tolerance.
Besides, the word "Christian" is derived
from Christ. Thus, being Christ-like certainly
means exhibiting tolerance and inclusion.
Perhaps the Dove World Outreach Center
should look closely at the life of the founder
of their religion.
For that matter, perhaps we all should do
the same with our own beliefs.
Nora F. ZakiResponse to sex column is spot-on
Joe Dellosa, thank you for writing your
column, "Infidelity should not be normal-
ized," in Tuesday's Alligator. I agree with
you wholeheartedly.
I have always thought very strongly that
cheating on someone is the worst thing a per-
son can do to another.
The repercussions are long-lasting.
The cheated-on may have trust issues, and
the cheater may feel that they can cheat re-
peatedly, not understanding what they really
are doing.
You are spot-on when you say that it is
about respect, and to me, there is no justifi-
cation, ever, for disrespecting another person
(especially someone you care about) in this
manner.

Guest column
France is misrepresented as having 'clean'nuclear programs
t is perhaps no accident that the nuclear
power industry chose a French word, "re-
aissance," to promote its alleged come-
back. Attached to this misapplied moniker are
a series of fallacious suggestions that nuclear
energy is "clean," "safe" and even "renew-
able." And, in keeping with its French flavor,
a key argument in the industry's propaganda
arsenal is that the U.S. should follow the "suc-
cessful" example of the French nuclear pro-
gram.
France serves as a convenient sound bite
for politicians and others advocating a nuclear
revival (hypocritically evoked by many of the
same people who insisted on "Freedom Fries"
at the start of the Iraq War). A failure to chal-
lenge this facile falsehood has cemented the
myth of a French nuclear utopia in the mindsof the public. It masks a very different reality.
France gets 80 percent of its electricity from
nuclear power. However, this alone does not
constitute a success. Rather, it results in the
production of an enormous amount of radio-
active waste that, as is the case for all other nu-
clear countries, has nowhere to go. France has
no operating geological repository for nuclear
waste. To date, therefore, it has resorted to
reprocessing, a highly contaminating chemi-
cal process that separates uranium and pluto-
nium while releasing large quantities of liquid
and aerial radioactivity into the environment.
Nuclear energy has not gained France en-
ergy independence. France imports all ura-
nium used in its 58 reactors -having aban-
doned the last of its 210 uranium mines in
2001. These latter also produced a large wasteLinda Gunter stream, including tail-
Speaking Out ings (radioactive rocks
and soils) that have
been used to pave chil-
dren's playgrounds and public parking lots.
Today, French uranium is imported largely
from Niger where Areva -which, despite
its corporate appearance, is 90 percent gov-
ernment-owned -has mined for 40 years. Its
legacy in one of the poorest countries on the
planet is one of depleted and contaminated
water, wide dispersal of radioactive dust and
discarded radioactive metals that have been
sold in local markets and used in homes. Nor
can nuclear meet all French electricity needs.
During heat waves and droughts, the French
havebeen forced to power down or close more
than a third of their nuclear plants, which relyon water sources such as rivers and lakes
for cooling. None of this has deterred Areva
or EDF from driving aggressively into new
nuclear markets, especially the U.S., where
Aerva is promoting its huge Evolutionary
Power Reactor (EPR), with seven targeted at
six U.S. sites. Since new reactors are too expen-
sive to build unless federally funded, EPRs in
the U.S. could result in American tax dollars
flowing to the French government. However,
French nuclear success overseas has proved as
elusive as it is at home. All but two of the U.S.
EPRs are now on the back burner or canceled
altogether.
Linda Gunter is co-founder of Beyond Nuclear
and specializes in researching the French nuclear
sector.

Students to tear
down wall of hate
Jamison Duncan, a history and education major, paints an insult he found offensive on a cinder block for the
Writing on the Wall Project Tuesday afternoon.By NICOLE LYNN GREINER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Bricks with statements in-
cluding "You aren't smart
enough to do that" and "Ho-
mos are sinners" were stacked
on the Reitz Union North
Lawn Tuesday.
Students decorated the
bricks as part of the Writing
on the Wall Project. Through
the project, students paint the
bricks with hurtful or offen-
sive statements and will build
a wall using the bricks Mon-
day.
On Jan. 29, students will
gather in the Plaza of the
Americas to tear down the
wall.
"We want people to think
before they say that hurtful
statement," said Cary War-
setsky, a chemical engineering
junior and the administrative
director for the Writing on the
Wall Project. "If we can makesomeone a little bit happier,
then I think we've done a good
job."
Warsetsky said students
can write whatever they want
on the bricks unless it is a
personal attack that includes
someone's name.
UF freshman Shalonda
Lewis said the project is in-
teresting because it shows the
perspectives of others.
"To me or you, 'Jew,' is not
an insult, but to other people it
could be," Lewis said.
Lewis wrote "WhoRE" on
her brick.
"I think we tend to pre-
judge others and go off what
they have on rather than who
they are," she said.
The project will continue
on the Plaza of the Americas
today and Thursday from 8
a.m. to 3 p.m. Students can
also paint bricks at the Reitz
Union North Lawn on Friday
from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Law professor: airport
body scanners legal
By ALLYSON FOX
Alligator Contributing Writer
Privacy is one thing travelers may
soon have to do without.
According to a recent USA Today/
Gallup poll following the attempted
Christmas Day bombing of Northwest
Flight 253, 78 percent of Americans sup-
port the use of new airport scanners that
create a more revealing image of the
subject than a simple X-ray.
John Stinneford, assistant professor
of law at the UF Levin College of Law,
said the new body scanners do not vio-
late the Fourth Amendment's unreason-
able search and seizure clause.
"What is reasonable depends on what
we expect," Stinneford said.
If the government shows reason for
conducting the full-body scans, travel-
ers won't be able to refuse, said Juan F.
Perea, a law professor at the UF Levin
College of Law.
"It's just something we need to get
used to," he said.Sari Koshetz, Transportation Secu-
rity Administration spokesperson, said
the new scanner's images are anony-
mous, adding that passengers' faces are
blurred.
"What is reasonable depends
on what we expect."
John Stinneford
assistant professor of law at the UF
Levin College of Law
Although Orlando International Air-
port and Gainesville Regional Airport
do not use the new scanners, Jackson-
ville International Airport has already
installed them.
Orlando is expected to install the
new technology soon, according to an
Orlando International Airport spokes-
woman.
UF freshman Henry Legett believes
the new full-body scanners are a justi-
fied precaution.
"I think it's a greater step towards
safety," Legett said.AvadaM from Commerdai o PovWos
Pierre-Louis arrested for domestic battery by strangulation

Pierre-Louis, who turned himself in at
2:16 a.m. according to Alachua County Jail

Mayor to discuss city's future in annual address
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan will discuss
Gainesville's 2009 accomplishments and
its short-term plans for the future in the
2010 State of the City address today.
The speech, which is open to the pub-
lic, will begin at 8 a.m. at the Hippodrome
State Theatre, 25 SE Second Place.Bob Woods, city of Gainesville spokes-
man, said Hanrahan began the State of the
City address six years ago, during her first
term.
"The mayor will highlight some of this
year's successes and talk about moving to-
ward the future and the kind of Gainesville
we all want to live in," Woods said.
Hanrahan is expected to discuss top-
ics including environmental conservation,
neighborhood improvement and budgetHanrahanissues.
"This address is an un-
fettered opportunity for
the mayor to inform the
public on the city com-
mission's perspective,"
Woods said.
Those who cannot
attend can watch the
address on television on Community12,
which is on Cox Cable channel 12.A print document of the address will
also be available on the city's Web site.
Eventually, a video of the address will
stream on the city's Web site at cityof-
gainesville.org, Woods said.
"One of the great things about
Gainesville is that we have a civically en-
gaged community," Woods said. "That's
why we enjoy the standard of living that
we do."
Political groups conflict over senator's racial comments
0 SEN. REID COMMENTED
ON OBAMA IN HIS BOOK.
By ASHLEY LARA MOSES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Local experts have expressed
conflicting opinions regarding
comments Senate Majority Lead-
er Harry Reid, D-Nev., made in
"Game Change," a book about
the 2008 presidential election re-
leased Jan. 11.During the election, Reid said
President Obama "could become
the country's first black president
because he was 'light-skinned'
and had 'no Negro dialect, unless
he wanted to have one,"' accord-
ing to a New York Times article.
In a statement, Obama said he
had forgiven Reid, but Reid's
comments led some Republicans
to advocate for his resignation.
Bryan Griffin, executive direc-
tor of the Florida Federation of
College Republicans, supportsthe idea of Reid's resignation.
Griffin said he was surprised
Democrats didn't react more
strongly to the statements. He
said he thinks the

NewS have been differ-
ent if a Republican
had made the same comments.
"The Democrats live on a dou-
ble-standard," Griffin said.
Other Gainesville locals ex-
pressed different points of view.
Ben Cavataro, president of theFlorida College Democrats, dis-
agreed and said Reid is not rac-
ist.
Cavataro said Reid's support
from the Congressional Black
Caucus and Obama is more im-
portant than the comments.
Faye V. Harrison, professor
of African-American studies and
anthropology, agrees Reid should
not resign.
"President Obama does not
want him to resign," Harrison
said. "He's part of an alliance -a team that is important at this
time."
Shannon McNeal, president of
UF's Black Student Union, said
she would like to see Obama and
other officials use the comments
as an opportunity to hold an open
discussion about race.
She said racial stereotypes still
exist.
"For my entire life, I've gotten
comments like, 'You're so articu-
late for a young African-Ameri-
can girl,"' McNeal said.

Employers remain optimistic despite lower turnout
By LYN KRAMER

The recession is making an
impression on this year's Spring

Fewer companies and students
attended the Spring Career Show-
case Tuesday at the O'Connell

About 2,000 students showed
up Tuesday, Glover said.
Glover said about 200 com-
panies are expected to attend
the two-day showcase, which is
about 20 percent fewer than the
usual turnout.
However, Glover said compa-

Injuries cause UF to
rework practices
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF coach Billy Donovan made adjustments to his team's practices due to lack of depth caused by inju-
ries. Instead of running 5-on-5 scrimmages, the Gators can only play 4-on-4.0 GATORS CAN'T RUN FULL-
TEAM SCRIMMAGES.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a be rry@alIlIiga to r org
Billy Donovan has mixed up
his team's practice routine quite a
bit in the last week.
Although he made one par-
ticular change to fix a season-long
flaw, most of the adjustments
have come out of necessity.
With Florida battling injuries
and illnesses, Donovan was lucky
if he could get eight players on the
practice court last week.
"When you're down a player
or two, sometimes we really don't
have enough," Donovan said.
"Sometimes we get caught doing
three-on-three stuff. Sometimes
we do four-on-four.
"We just try to deal with,
coaching-wise, the hand that
we're dealt."
The lack of able-bodied play-
ers in practice hasn't made game
planning any easier for Donovan,
his staff or his team.
With Adam Allen likely out for
the season after suffering another
left knee injury and Kenny Kadjiout indefinitely with a herniated
disc, any other injuries to key
players have proven more costly
this season than they would have
in the past.
So when senior forward Dan
Werner came down with the flu
last week, it affected more than
just UF's starting lineup Satur-
day.
Junior forward Chandler Par-
sons, who started the game in
Werner's spot, was forced to prac-
tice at power forward even though
he plays almost exclusively on the
perimeter.
"The difficulty in doing that
is that Chandler in games is not
playing at the power forward
spot," Donovan said. "Sometimes
in practice, we're getting caught
playing guys in positions they're
not even playing in games.
With fewer available players,
the Gators' reserves have had to
take on increased roles in practice.
Walk-on guard Kyle McClanahan
was asked to mimic LSU guard Bo
Spencer in practice last week, and
sophomore guard Ray Shipman
had to impersonate LSU forward
Tasmin Mitchell.

Butler leads tight-knit staff
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@a lIigator org
Amanda Butler referred to the UF wom-
en's basketball program as a family.
It's not hard to see why given the fact
that Butler has worked with all of her as-
sistants at stops prior to Gainesville.
"We are together all the time," Butler
said of her coaching staff. "We take care
of each other, disagree like family, and at
the end of the day, we all have a common
goal and a common purpose. It's a group
of people that I'm very privileged to work
with."
When Butler returned to her alma mat-
er to fill the head coaching position, she
brought members from her coaching staff
at UNC Charlotte that guided the school to
a share of the 2006 Atlantic 10 Conference
regular-season championship.Coaches Brenda Mock Kirkpatrick, Da-
vid Lowery and Butler's assistant Janna
Magette all made the trip to Gainesville.
But the young staff led by the young-
est coach in the Southeastern Conference
needed some experience.
Butler brought in Su-
sie Gardner, whom But-
ler had been an assistant
under at Austin Peay, to
round out her staff.
In her time there as a
budding assistant coach,
Butler noticed Gardner's
Butler attention to detail and
organization. The two built a trust factor in-
herent with success -an Ohio Valley Con-
ference Tournament title in 2001 -that
made Gardner an easy choice to complete
Butler's staff.

UF's coaches have past experience with each other
WHOOPS, from page 17
Gardner honed her SEC knowledge at Ar-
kansas from 2003-2007 and brought that to a
youthful coaching staff.
The reversal of roles between Butler and
Gardner has helped Butler as a head coach,
working for her previous boss.
"It certainly gives me a greater apprecia-
tion, when we're having debates about how
we want to do things, where she's coming
from because I feel like I have insight into how
she thinks," Butler said.
The history and comfortabilitybetween But-
ler and her aides got them on the same coach-
ing page, which translated to the players.
"Definitely the familiarity with one another
helps," Butler said. "It helps in terms of com-
munication and just being
effective and efficient."
In conference play, when
Women ' there's a quick turnaround
between games, the ex-Basketball change of communication is
invaluable.
"I think they're definitely comfortable with
each other," sophomore guard Jordan Jones
said. "You see it with the way they pick on
each other. They expect certain things out of
each other. They know their roles and they
play them well."
aWhether it's Butler, as the enforcer barking
out directions, or Gardener patting a player on
the back on one of her good days, the staff's
familiarity is something that has trickled down
to the players and bred success.
"My challenge was to put together the best
staff that I possibly could, to not just compete
in the SEC, but to win championships in the
SEC," Butler said. "I chose them to be on staff
because they were exceptional: exceptional re-
cruiters, great basketball minds and above all
things, exceptionally loyal and hard workers."Smaller squad leads
to tiring workouts
HOOPS, from page 17
man wasn't exactly the ideal candidate to mimic
the 6-foot-7, 245-pound Mitchell, who scored 17
points and grabbed nine rebounds against UF on
Saturday.
"Not to take nothing away from them, but
they're nowhere near those type of guys," sopho-
more point guard Erving Walker said. "Ray is
good, but he's not Tasmin Mitchell -he's a guard
trying to be a forward."
Freshman guard Kenny Boynton said the big-
gest difference for the players has been the switch
from five-on-five to four-on-four scrimmages, a
change that has made practices a little more tir-
ing for those capable of taking the floor.
Possibly the most important change made in
practices, though, was Donovan's decision to
break up Friday's practice with a short film ses-
sion in between drills and scrimmages.
The move simulated the break the team would
have at halftime, after which UF has come out
slow for most of the season.
The move paid off Saturday, as the Gators
started off the second half with a 23-6 run that
put the game all but out of reach with 12:53 re-
maining.
"I'm gonna try to keep doing that," Donovan
said. "I'm not gonna say we'll do it every day,
but it's something we'll try to continue."
At least a few of Donovan's players hope to
see it become a more common occurrence, espe-
cially after seeing how effective it proved to be.
"I don't have a problem doing it," Parsons
said. "We're 1-0 doing it, so why not?"
MCCALL, from page 17
The Mack held things down
against LSU with 14 points -
more than he scored in his first
two SEC games combined. He
tied a season-high with eight re-
bounds, but most importantly, he
played 28 minutes and collected
zero fouls.
In the previous two games,
Macklin was on the court for just
33 total minutes and racked up
nine fouls.The Gators already have a
depth problem, and they can't af-
ford to have their biggest threat in
the paint dropping out of games
early for picking up weak fouls.
Macklin was physical against
the Tigers, but he did it in a smart-
er way.
He did a better job of getting
in position, which led to more re-
bounds, less fouls and more room
to be aggressive on the offensive
end.
"We've had him in foul troublethe first two games, and when we
have him down there, he's a load,"
forward Chandler Parsons said.
"When we get him the ball in the
post, he's really hard to guard. We
definitely need him on the court."
Parsons also called Macklin
"one of the most unselfish big
guys I've ever played with in my
life." For that reason, he may nev-
er go off for 25 points in a game,
but the Gators don't need him to.
Macklin just has to stay on the
court, make a few of his silky-smooth hook shots and play de-
fense.
"He's a big, strong presence for
us," guard Erving Walker said.
"He can battle with all those big
guys when he's able to play ag-
gressive and not get fouls. I think
he's as good as (Kentucky forward
DeMarcus) Cousins and all those
guys, so we need to keep him on
the floor. That makes everyone's
job easier because we can be more
aggressive on the press knowing
he's back there."Macklin has a ripple effect just
by staying out of foul trouble, and
the immediate future looks good
for a few confidence-boosters.
He'll be the tallest player on
the court against the Gators' next
two opponents, Arkansas and
South Carolina, who are the SEC's
worst teams in terms of rebound-
ing margin.
If he relapses into his freely
fouling ways against those teams,
I might have to change that song
suggestion to "Thunder Road."Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
