THEY ARE BEING 
PAID $50,000
By Ana Escalante
Alligator Staff Writer
In 2016, President Donald 
Trump promised Americans 
he would “drain the Swamp.” 
In 2019, his son will speak at 
it.
Donald Trump Jr. and 
Kimberly Guilfoyle, senior adviser to the president’s re-
election campaign, will give a 
keynote presentation at UF’s 
University Auditorium on Oct. 
10 at 7 p.m. 
Hours after the announce-
ment, a protest was sched-
uled.
They will be paid $50,000, 
funded by student activity 
fees, according to the contract 
with UF. It is unclear how the 
payment will be split between 
them. Students can get tickets 
Tuesday with a valid Gator 1 
ID. The general public can get 
remaining tickets at 5 p.m. the 
day of the event. The audito-
rium seats more than 800. 
Trump Jr. is the executive 
vice president of the Trump 
Organization. Guilfoyle previ-
ously served as co-host of Fox 
News Channel’s “The Five,” 
which she left in July 2018 
after allegations of inappropri-
ate behavior and sexual mis-conduct, according to a report 
from Vox. 
The ACCENT Speakers 
Bureau, run by UF Student 
Government, announced the 
event on its Facebook page 
Tuesday afternoon. 
ACCENT chair Henry Fair, 
a 21-year-old UF political sci-
ence senior, wrote in an email 
that the organization is excit-
ed to have speakers provide 
an opportunity for students to 
engage in civil discourse. “Part of our mission is to 
engage the UF campus com-
munity in discussions on 
important issues by bringing 
prominent, inﬂ  uential and, 
often times, controversial 
speakers to campus,” Fair 
wrote.
Jarrod Rodriguez, UF Col-
lege Republicans treasurer, 
said he’s looking forward to 
listening to Trump Jr. speak. Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle to speak at UF
SHE LEFT WHILE POLICE

SECURITY FOOTAGE

Gainesville Police arrested a daycare 
worker Tuesday accused of beating an 
8-month-old child on Thursday.
Erica Hall, 37, is accused of beat-
ing the child at Cuddly Kids Academy, 
located on the 1020 block of Southeast 
4th Avenue, according to a GPD press 
release. Police said Hall left the daycare 
while they were watching the surveil-
lance video. 
She was arrested on a warrant and 
charged with abuse of a child, accord-
ing to court records.Laqueisha Davis, 
the child’s mother, 
told The Alligator 
her son’s right eye 
is bloodshot and 
he has bruising 
under his eyes and 
across his face. She 
is removing her son 
from enrollment at 
the daycare and plans on taking legal 
action against Hall and the Academy’s 
director. Cuddly Kids Academy de-
clined to comment.
Davis said she received a call from 
the daycare after 3 p.m. Thursday say-
ing her son got into a minor accident. 
She had been taking her son to the 
daycare for the past three months and 
didn’t suspect physical abuse prior.Davis said she was skeptical of what 
happened due to the bruising on her 
son’s face and asked the daycare work-
ers to see the surveillance footage.
When she said staff wouldn’t imme-
diately let her view the footage, Davis 
called 911. She said the footage showed 
Hall repeatedly hitting her son on a dia-
per changing table.
“He can’t talk, he can’t walk,” Da-
vis said. ‘What could he have possibly 
done to deserve this?”
Hall is being held in the Alachua 
County Jail on a $10,000 bond, accord-
ing to court records.

SECOND TIME 
RUNNING FOR 
STATE OFFICE
By Jordyn Kalman and

Kayser Enneking is 
hoping that the second 
time’s the charm. 
On Tuesday, Dr. 
Kayser Enneking, a UF 
Health Shands Hospital 
anesthesiologist, announced 
she officially filed her 
candidacy to run for a seat 
in the Florida House of 
Representatives’ District 21, 
which represents Alachua, 
Gilcrest and Dixie counties. 
She is running as 
a Democrat to unseat 
incumbent Rep. Chuck 
Clemons in 2020.
In 2018, she lost the 
District 8 Senate general 
election by 2,000 votes. 
Although this disappointed 
her, Enneking said in an 
August interview that it also 
motivated her to run again 
and finish what she started. 
Her main focus will be on 
reforming health care and 
advocating for Medicaid’s 
expansion in Florida, 
Enneking said. 
“I would be better served 
by actually being in the 
legislature because I wanted 
to do something about 
health care,” she said. “It’s something that I think we 
can win or I wouldn’t be 
doing this. It is a way for the 
patient’s voice to be heard.”
Enneking, who is a 
UF alumna and lifelong 
Gainesville resident, is also 
a professor and chair for the 
anesthesiology department 
at UF. Her decision to 
become involved with 
politics was driven by a 
desire to help people on a 
larger scale, she said. 
“It was an extraordinary 
change in direction for me,” 
she said. “I realized I could 
either take care of six to 10 
patients a day, or I could 
work on a different level 
and do more good for more 
people.” 
Enneking said her 
experience in the medical 
field translates well into 
politics because it taught 
her how to talk to people 
from all walks of life, 
adapt quickly to changing 
environments and be a 
leader.
Bennett Ragan, 21, 
Enneking’s campaign 
manager, said Enneking 
announced she was going 
to run in August, but she 
has now submitted all of the 
paperwork to the state.
“That kind of the changes 
the legal framework. She’s 
now a candidate,” he said. 
Ragan said Florida was Enneking ﬁ  les campaign

$1,000,000 BOND 
By Dana Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
The UF student wanted for 
attempted murder charges for 
more than a week was arrested 
Monday.
Khalil Reed, 24, had a war-
rant for his arrest since Sept. 
20 after being released from 
jail for marijuana possession 
days earlier. He was accused of shooting three people in a 
Butler Plaza parking lot near 
Walmart after four men stole 2 
pounds of marijuana from him 
at gunpoint.
Law enforcement wrote 
he admitted to shooting three 
people after being arrested, ac-
cording to court records. 
It is unclear if he turned 
himself in or not. Reed’s law-
yer did not respond to requests 
to comment.
Reed remains in the Alach-ua County Jail on a $1,000,000 
bond, according to the jail as 
of Tuesday morning. Patrick 
Abbott, one of the men in-
volved, was arrested Tuesday. 
Austin Fletcher, the ﬁ  rst arrest 
of the three men Reed shot at, 
remains in jail on a $250,000 
bond.
There wasn’t enough evi-
dence to charge Reed for at-
tempted murder while behind 
bars for his ﬁ  rst arrest, said 
GPD spokesperson Capt. Jorge Campos.
Campos said authorities 
were considering if the inci-
dent fell under Florida’s “Stand 
Your Ground” law. It wasn’t 
clear from law enforcement 
and prosecutors why Reed 
wasn’t charged with attempted 
murder before posting his origi-
nal $30,000 bond. 
On his ﬁ  rst arrest, when 
a court ofﬁ  cial considered 
whether he would miss future 
court dates, Reed’s risk level was circled as “low.” A court 
ofﬁ  cial circled his risk level as 
“low” again on his second ar-
rest, after being wanted for 
murder for more than a week.
Reed pleaded not guilty to 
four counts of attempted mur-
der, according to court records.

 STORES EXPECTED TO CLOSE 
FOLLOWING BANKRUPTCY
By Priya Dames
Alligator Staff Writer
When Rong Tang made her monthly 
trip to the Oaks Mall Forever 21, some-
thing was different.
“We didn’t hear anything, but this is 
the bag they gave us,” said the 22-year-
old UF biochemistry senior, pointing to a 
generic, logo-less black shopping bag. It 
looked nothing like the company’s signa-
ture yellow bag. 
This is only one symptom of Forever 
21’s recent announcement of bankruptcy.
The Oaks Mall Forever 21 conﬁ  rmed 
the store will remain open, but declined 
to comment further.   
According to a public statement from 
the company on Sunday, the bankruptcy 
does not mean the company is going out 
of business but merely taking steps to “re-
organize.”
Decisions as to which domestic and 
international stores will be closed are 
pending, according to the statement. It 
may close “as many as 178 locations in 
the U.S.”
Local bargain hunter Oliver Su, a 21-year-old UF electrical engineering se-
nior who visited the Oaks Mall with Tang, 
said he waited eagerly to take advantage 
of potential close-out sales and deals. 
“That’s why we came here, to maybe 
get a discount here,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Sarah Miller, a 25-year-old 
UF nursing graduate student, heard about 
the bankruptcy online but was uncertain 
about how it would affect the Oaks Mall.  
“We hadn’t heard much besides a post 
on Instagram that said something like, 
‘Forever 21 declared bankruptcy: looks 
like it’s not forever,’” Miller said. 
Miller, a semi-frequent visitor to the 
Oaks Mall, depending on how often she 
wants to get her eyebrows done, said she 
stops by Forever 21 on most of her trips.
Miller ﬁ  rst estimated that she had been 
to the Oaks Mall ﬁ  ve times this year, al-
though her friend, who was with her at 
the time, said it was more like ﬁ  ve times 
this month.
“We’re frequent ﬂ  iers,” Miller said. 
“We’ll deﬁ  nitely keep shopping here.”

70 PEOPLE ATTENDED MUSEUM’S 
FIRST MUSHROOM EVENT
By Ellen Bausback
Alligator Staff Writer
Armed with sun hats, bug spray and wicker 
baskets, 70 people collected mushrooms Sunday 
at the Florida Museum of Natural History.
Mushrooms at the Museum was the ﬁ  rst fungi-
focused event held at the museum, said Chelsea 
Collison, the event organizer and a museum edu-
cator. There are no current plans for another event.
The museum partnered with mushroom sci-
entists Alan and Arleen Bessette of Georgia, who 
have written more than 27 mushroom ﬁ  eld guide-
books, and local organization Florida Academic Li-
chen And Fungi Enthusiasts League (FALAFEL) to 
put on the free all-day activity, Collison said.
From 10 a.m. to noon, participants searched for 
mushrooms on the Natural Area Teaching Labora-
tory trail behind the museum. Arleen Bessette said 
the recent dry weather is not favorable for mush-
room growth. Florida’s usual wet conditions are 
ideal. 
“It’s been a horrible year,” she told the group. 
“So don’t expect any fruiting bodies.”
At the end of the walk, collections of more than 
50 different species ﬁ  lled a picnic table. 
“I’m absolutely amazed to see how many 
things they brought in despite the dry conditions,” 
Alan Bessette said.He also gave a lecture called, “Dixie Chicks: 
The Hangouts and Habits of Gulf Coast Mush-
rooms.” The lecture covered Gulf Coast mushroom 
habitats and species like the Southern Jack-O’-
Lantern, which glows green in the dark. Wind can 
carry mushroom spores over 8,000 miles, causing 
species from the Caribbean and Africa to grow in 
Florida.
“You’re living in a great place to ﬁ  nd new 
mushrooms,” Alan Bessette told the crowd.
Rebecca Ugo-Applegate said she didn’t mind 
driving two hours from Zephyrhills to come to 
the event with her husband. She wanted to learn 
about mushrooms after hiking.
“Looking for them distracts us from all the 
weight on our backs from our backpacks,” she 
said.
Ross Joseph, the FALAFEL president, said he 
was happy with the turnout. He began studying 
fungi as a hobby 10 years ago. 
“I can’t say I like the taste of mushrooms as 
much as some people,” he said. “For me it’s really 
sort of like a scientiﬁ  c fascination.” 
Joseph, who is also a UF microbiology doctoral 
student, studies fungi that are symbiotic with in-
sects and fungi that cause diseases in trees and 
insects in his microbiology lab. 
“What we want to do is take our knowledge of 
fungi and really disseminate it to the community,” 
he said. 
@ellen_bausback
evausback@alligator.org Florida Museum hosts fungi fun timeReed
Rodriguez, a 20-year-old UF politi-
cal science junior, has supported the 
president and his family since 2016. 
“I personally admire just how 
much of a ﬁ  erce supporter he is, an 
advocate he is, of the president,” Ro-
driguez said.
William Zelin, a 21-year-old UF 
political science and statistics senior, 
created a Facebook event page to 
protest the speakers. 
Zelin ﬁ  rst heard about the event in a group chat with other students.
He said he thought it was a joke.  
“What expertise does he have 
other than growing up with a spoon 
in his with a silver spoon in his 
mouth? And, you know, doing what-
ever daddy tells him?” Zelin said. 
After multicultural organizations 
lost funding over the summer, Zelin 
said inviting Trump Jr. was a slap 
in the face considering his family’s 
“hateful rhetoric.” 
“In my opinion, to say that Stu-
dent Government is going to spend 
thousands and thousands and thou-sands of dollars on a speaker who 
enabled… one of the most bigoted 
presidents in the modern history… 
and allow our student fees to be 
going toward that while all these 
student organizations are facing a 
crisis… it’s just not fair,” Zelin said. 
Abby Solomon, a 2016 UF biol-
ogy alumna, said she supports stu-
dents protesting the speaking event, 
which she said uses student funds to 
bring two “controversial” speakers 
to campus. 
Solomon, ACCENT’s former 
vice chair of programming, said she 
doesn’t think the event will hold 
Trump Jr. accountable.
“I feel like that is really lowering the bar of the caliber of people that 
we should be inviting,” Solomon 
said.

LEE FELDMAN WAS 
SELECTED BY CITY 
COMMISSIONERS FRIDAY
By Alex DeLuca 
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville’s newly selected 
city manager was ﬁ  red from a 
similar city manging position in 
Fort Lauderdale. 
On Friday afternoon, 
Gainesville city commissioners 
ofﬁ  cially chose Lee Feldman as 
city manager in a 6-1 vote with 
Commissioner David Arreola in 
dissent. However, almost a year 
ago, Feldman was ﬁ  red from his 
previous position as Fort Lauder-
dale city manager. His dismissal was not men-
tioned in Friday’s meeting. 
Feldman said the Fort Lau-
derdale City Commission was 
“focused on a different type of 
growth for their community” at 
the time of his ﬁ  ring. 
“They just wanted change, and 
I was part of that change,” Feld-
man said.
In October 2018, Fort Lauder-
dale Mayor Dean Trantalis and 
City Commissioners Steven Glass-
man and Ben Sorensen voted 3-2 
to ﬁ  re Lee Feldman as Fort Lau-
derdale’s city manager. 
According to the Sun Sentinel, 
he was let go after the city said it 
was headed in a “new direction.” 
This came just a few months after the Sentinel reported that Feld-
man ignored Trantalis’ recom-
mendation to quit.  
Feldman said he left on amica-
ble terms, working until the end 
of his employment contract for 
an additional 80 days rather than 
the usual dismissal of a 60-day-
notice. 
“They pointed out when they 
did let me go, that it wasn’t due 
to any performance issues,” Feld-
man said. 
Gainesville City Commissioner 
Helen Warren, who voted in favor 
of Feldman’s appointment Friday, 
said she does not believe his ﬁ  r-
ing in Fort Lauderdale was due to 
“ﬂ  agrant misconduct.” 
“You know, it wasn’t like he was caught with his money in the 
cash register,” Warren said. “It 
was just a personality difference 
with some new commissioners 
who came on board.”
City of Fort Lauderdale spokes-
person Chaz Adams said the city 
appreciates Feldman’s leadership, 
dedication and contributions to 
the city government during his 
time as city manager. 
“We wish him continued suc-
cess as he begins a new chapter 
in his public service career with 
the City of Gainesville,” Adams 
said. 
The Alligator called and 
emailed Glassman and Sorensen 
multiple times, but neither could 
be reached for comment. Arreola declined to comment 
on his decision to vote against 
Feldman’s appointment. During 
the Friday special meeting, he 
said that the kind of candidate he 
is looking for in a city manager 
simply was not in the available 
pool. 
He said during the meeting 
that he would like to reopen the 
search for a new city manager. 
The commission and Feldman 
are still working out the details of 
his employment contract.

“That’s something that we want to 
highlight: that we can provide our citizens 
with access to quality, affordable health care 
so that they can be happy and they can be 
healthy,” he said. “They will not have to 
worry about the cost of healthcare getting in the way of that.”

Column
On Sept. 20, a youth climate strike 
of unprecedented proportions stood 
at the forefront of the world stage 
and inspired millions to protest for 
climate action and reform. 
Now, two weeks later, that energy has died 
down to some degree in Gainesville’s corner 
of the world and no one is really noticing. 
Unfortunately, it seems like this is a common 
trend in the era of social media and widespread 
news. 
This is a shame because it’s our generation’s 
responsibility to enact the change. The private sector 
still needs to be held accountable, the government still 
needs to be pressured and public sentiment still needs to 
be changed — and here lies the purpose of the Climate 
Reality Project.
The Climate Reality Project, a precursor to the 
current organization, was founded in 2006 by former 
Vice President Al Gore and funded with the proﬁ  ts from 
his documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.” According 
to member Deborah Scheuer, the Climate Reality Project 
is an international activist group spearheaded by Al 
Gore with a mission to “catalyze grassroots efforts in 
support of the environment on a global scale.” Scheuer 
is a 60-year-old retired UF faculty member who worked 
as an associate professor of physiology and functional 
genomics.
 “I’ve been interested in the environment my whole 
life. I grew up in Hawaii, where I learned to love the 
environment and the earth… So that’s why I retired 
early. I wanted to get involved,” she said.
Scheuer was trained as a Climate Reality leader in 
Atlanta in March. The Climate Reality Project operates, 
she said, by relating climate activism to local issues 
in the communities they hope to reform. The group attempt to connect the macro of the climate 
crisis to smaller issues that may be impacting 
people’s lives and energize communities to 
act on it.  
Its relationship with farmers is notable. 
Scheuer says that on one hand, there are a 
multitude of techniques that farmers can use, 
under the umbrella of regenerative agriculture, 
that drastically decrease emissions and save 
money for the farmers themselves.
Gainesville is on the right track. According to City 
Commissioner David Arreola, there is a resolution in 
the works as the city has spent millions of dollars of 
land conservation and just recently purchased 750 
acres in Gainesville. He also sponsored a resolution to 
commit GRU, a Gainesville energy company, to shift to 
100 percent renewable energy within the next 25 years.
 For individuals interested in getting involved 
or citizens with concerns, Arreola said there are a 
multitude of activist groups in Gainesville prepared to 
accept more members into their fold, and that he would 
be happy to listen to the concerns of any passionate 
parties. 
I feel comfortable saying that Gainesville is on the 
right track as far as climate advocacy. Our communities 
are galvanized, our politicians are active and our 
environments are being protected. However, so much 
cannot be said for the rest of the country, which has 
been notoriously slow to change. 
I urge Gainesville’s students and visitors to advocate 
for radical change in their homes and across the country 
so our generation might have the chance to save the 
future on the verge of destruction.

We all mourned the death of Vine. At its peak, the 
social network reached 40 million registered users 
in 2013. When it died in early 2017, the world was 
in shock. How could such a popular site end so 
quickly? The answer is actually quite simple and 
ruins most of the good things in our lives: corporate greed.
It’s hard to believe that social media outlets compete for 
users. Our parents use Facebook, we rely on Twitter for news 
updates and we can count on Instagram to ruin our self im-
ages. Although its uses can become intertwined, no social 
media site should stress too much about losing its users to 
competitors. Facebook especially has no reason to compete, 
as it’s the most used social media site in the world.
And yet, Facebook seems insecure.  
Facebook doesn’t want anyone catching up to it. When 
Vine was ﬁ  rst launched, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg 
made sure people could not use a friend-ﬁ  nding feature that 
would introduce more people to the app. Although this is not 
the primary reason Twitter, which owned Vine, shut down 
the blossoming app, it certainly contributed to hindering 
Vine’s growth. Ironically, Facebook seems to have some is-
sues with being friendly.
Snapchat appears to be suffering a similar fate. The ag-
gression seems to be more personal this time, as it directly at-
tacks the main aspect of Snapchat: stories. At ﬁ  rst, Facebook 
tried to make several copycats to beat Snapchat, but they all 
mostly failed. Eventually, Facebook even tried to buy Snap-
chat in 2013 for $3 billion. Of course, Snapchat refused, but 
the company didn’t expect the harsh repercussions resulting 
from that standoff, or from Facebook owning Instagram.
Instagram stories are beating Snapchat stories. 
When Instagram stories ﬁ  rst came out, many people 
didn’t see the point because Snapchat already existed. How-
ever, users (ourselves included) quickly found the appeal. 
According to CNN Business, Instagram stories are twice as 
popular as Snapchat’s and show no sign of slowing down. 
In fact, within eight months of launching, Instagram stories 
passed Snapchat in its number of daily users. And because 
of this, Snapchat has begun to lose users for the ﬁ  rst time.
However, unlike Vine, Snapchat seems to be ﬁ  ghting back. 
It recently released Facebook’s aggressive tactics in a dossier 
called Project Voldemort: a very ﬁ  tting name for a very dark 
company. It details how Facebook threatened to undermine 
Snapchat’s business through tactics like preventing content 
from trending on its app. This document is one of the major 
tools provided to the Federal Trade Commission to analyze 
Facebook’s aggressive growth and further their antitrust in-
vestigation. Looks like Facebook might be in a bit of trouble. 
However, this is a completely orthodox business prac-
tice. Competitors always try to ﬁ  nd ways to compete with 
each other. Whether it be adding new items to match each 
other or ad campaigns that insult one another, there is al-
ways competition going on. In fact, people should be con-
cerned if there is no competition in the future because that 
would suggest the start of a monopoly, kind of like what 
Facebook is trying to do. 
Facebook shouldn’t be allowed to do this, and it’s our 
responsibility as consumers to call them out on it, even if it 
turns our parents against us.

VIVACIOUS SHOW

Avenue Staff Writer 
Postmodern Jukebox brought its jazz 
renditions of new hits to the Phillips Cen-
ter for the Performing Arts last Wednes-
day, leaving the passionate audience in 
awe.
Postmodern Jukebox is a contemporary 
collective of musicians known for rework-
ing popular songs into vintage genres, es-
pecially swing and jazz. The group is cur-
rently on their “Welcome to the Twenties 
2.0” tour, which looks to bring the ’20s to 
the modern era by recreating today’s hits 
in a jazz arrangement. 
Almost a quarter of the audience mem-
bers arrived at the venue in formal attire. 
This lighthearted form of audience partici-
pation added to the upscale ambience and 
made the performance feel like a commu-
nal affair instead of a room of strangers.
The show began with singer and mas-
ter of ceremonies LaVance Colley taking 
the stage along with the band to perform 
a jazz rendition of Michael Jackson’s 
“Thriller.” The familiar and beloved song acted as a freight train of rhythm that led 
the audience to a roaring post-chorus ap-
plause.
After a few songs, Therese Curatolo, of 
Postmodern Jukebox, waltzed her way to 
the microphone. The band set off into an 
elegant arrangement of Billie Eilish’s chart-
topping hit “bad guy.” 
This version replaced the unique in-
strumental of the original and featured a 
sophisticated drum pattern and a fretless 
bassline. Curatolo kicked it into third gear 
after the breakdown and left the audience 
wanting more of her cool and collected at-
titude. 
Brandon Nappy, a 38-year-old director 
of marketing for the UF Performing Arts 
Center, said the show was a big success. 
Nappy said the total number of tickets sold 
was over 1,600, bringing attendance very 
close to the venue’s capacity of 1,750. 
Elizabeth Auer, assistant director for 
the UF Performing Arts Center, said her 
organization has wanted Postmodern 
Jukebox to perform here for years. The 
Performing Arts Center booked Postmod-
ern Jukebox in the fall of 2018 for their 
Wednesday appearance. 
Auer said she was “very pleased” with 
the jazz collective’s ﬁ  rst appearance at the 
Phillips Center.“I was so impressed with the emcee 
and how energized he got the crowd,” 
Auer said. “That takes true talent.” 
The night concluded with Scott Bra-
dlee, multi-instrumentalist and creator of 
Postmodern Jukebox, walking from his 
seat to the stage left grand piano to ask 
concertgoers for song suggestions. Bradlee 
fused audience-requested songs like The 
Clash’s “Rock the Casbah” and Beyonce’s 
“Crazy in Love” in an instant. 
Cheerful echoes of questions such as, 
“How is that possible?” ﬁ  lled the Phillips 
Center as the crowd began exiting the 
building. 
Samantha Johnson, an 18-year-old UF 
exploratory freshman, said she had a won-
derful time at the performance. 
“They performed Paramore and Lana 
Del Rey, and I love both of those artists so 
that was very exciting for me. They deﬁ  -
nitely did both artists and songs justice,” 
she said.
Upcoming events at the Phillips Center 
can be found on their website. UF students 
get discounts to all events put on by the 
Performing Arts Center by showing their 
Gator 1 Card.

FLORIDA FOOTBALL IS THE 
FIRST FEATURED TEAM IN 
THE NEW HBO SERIES
By Eli Rosen
Alligator Contributing Writer
HBO’s series premiere of “24/7 
College Football” kicks off tonight, 
giving Gators fans the chance to see 
behind the scenes of Florida football 
like never before.
The hour-long special will pro-
vide viewers with an all-access look 
into the rigorous preparation of the 
Florida football team as they pre-
pared to take on the Towson Tigers 
Saturday. Viewers can tune in today 
at 10 p.m. on HBO to catch the ac-
tion.
“Our days were long,” Matthew 
Chase, a producer for HBO Sports, 
said. “But that’s only because every-
one who works around this team’s 
days were long.”
The Gators were clear favorites 
leading up to last week’s matchup, 
but that did not affect how they pre-
pared for the game, Chase said. 
The show provides fans with a 
thorough look into the fast-paced, 
detail-oriented schedule of the Flor-
ida Gators practice week leading up to gameday.
“Anyone who is a fan of Florida 
Gator football will love seeing how 
dedicated their favorite players have 
to be to play this game,” he said.
The episode provides a compre-
hensive view into the detailed plan-
ning that has been instrumental in 
the Gators’ success thus far.
“We learned how hard everyone 
in the program works,” Chase said. 
“Not just the players and coaches, 
but also the administrative staff, 
equipment managers, nutritionists, 
grounds crew and many more.”
The special not only looks at 
what happens within the conﬁ  nes of 
Florida’s football facilities, but also 
outside of them as well.
“The show will give an in-depth 
look into some of the personalities 
and stories of people around the pro-
gram,” Chase said. “From spending 
time with Feleipe Franks on the day 
of his surgery, to seeing what some 
of the guys do for fun after practice, 
viewers will get to feel the ups and 
downs that a football team goes 
through throughout a week.”
Even with the increased media 
presence, the Gators kept focus as if 
it were any other week of practice.
“I don’t think the cameras fazed 
many of the guys on the team,” Chase said. “To be honest, I think 
they had a lot of fun.”
Gator fans can also look forward 
to team’s pregame routine, a part of 
a series that Patrick Dimon, a cam-
eraperson on the show, said he had 
the most fun documenting. 
“From the team pregame; locker 
room, warm ups, speeches, pads 
being on, music blasting; you could 
feel the excitement increasing as the 
kickoff approached,” Dimon said.
Dimon said the focus and dis-
cipline of the team was one of the 
most impressive parts about the pro-
gram.
“We felt invisible in that we 
could be at practice or meetings and 
everyone was going about their busi-
ness as if we weren’t there,”  he said. 
“Which is the beauty of the show.”
The intensity of Gators football 
will be brought to the forefront to-
night, showing fans the process and 
routines that have fueled the team to 
a 4-0 record to begin its season.
“The scope of the program really 
surprised me: how many people and 
how many hours it takes to prepare 
a team for any given game,” said 
Chase. “It was pretty cool to see, and 
I think viewers will feel that when 
they see the show on Wednesday 
night.”

REDEFINED GOODS MADE 
THEIR PRESENCE AT INDIE 
FLEA FOR THE FIRST TIME
Samantha Scribano
Avenue Staff Writer
Amidst the wave of the same 
JanSport and Herschel backpacks, 
a new kind of bag has surfaced on 
UF’s campus. With a button-down 
shirt and a pair of jeans hanging on 
your shoulder, suddenly you can 
wear two outﬁ  ts at once.
A new student-run company, 
“Redeﬁ  ned Goods”, repurposes old 
clothing into fashionable accesso-
ries. The key products include tote 
bags and matching scrunchies.
Mia Crisostomo, a 20-year-old 
UF marketing and sustainability 
studies junior, started the business 
in September of 2018. She sews the 
bags and then uses the scraps to 
make scrunchies as a way to reduce 
waste. 
Crisostomo participated Sunday 
in the Gainesville Indie Flea Pop 
Up market, a multi-city event that 
aims to showcase “indie” products, 
ranging from jewelry to plants. It 
was her second in-person vending 
experience. 
Crisostomo said she wanted to 
participate in the Indie Flea market 
to expand her impact beyond word 
of mouth and her Instagram pres-
ence.
“It’s cool that it [Indie Flea] is a 
market that people kind of know, so 
I thought that it would be a really 
good idea,” she said. “It has a fol-
lowing and it’s more up my alley in 
terms of handmade goods.”
At the market, she was able to 
sell 18 bags and approximately 40 scrunchies— much more than her 
average sales.
Crisostomo said each bag takes 
her about 45 minutes to create and 
she makes an average of 10 bags 
each week. Each bag costs $25 and 
bags with pockets cost $30.
“They go really fast,” she said. 
“All the bags that I post [on Insta-
gram] will sell out in like 10 min-
utes. Now that I post at a single 
time, everyone that wants one is on 
there at that time.”
People often stop her on campus 
and at parties because they recog-
nize her from her business, she said.
“It’s cool now that it’s getting 
bigger,” Crisostomo said.  “People 
who go here to UF that see my bags 
on other people will take pictures of 
them and send them to me.”
Crisostomo’s impact stretches 
beyond Gainesville’s campus life as 
her business grows.  Her bags and 
other products have made their way 
out of Florida and onto the campus 
of LSU, speciﬁ  cally.
Students are crushed every time 
Anjelina Gonzalez, a 20-year-old ju-
nior at LSU, explains that her hand-
made clothing set is entirely unique 
and not in stores for purchase. 
“Every time I wear it everyone 
loves it and people want to know 
where I got it from, but it’s a one-of-
a-kind because Mia made it,” Gon-
zalez said.
She said she has been supporting 
Crisostomo since her early years of 
creativity.
Gonzalez owns two clothing 
sets, a T-shirt, a pair of shorts, two 
scrunchies and a bag, all made by 
Crisostomo. Gonzalez said she 
uses her bag throughout the day 
as a purse and to buy goods at lo-
cal farmers markets. The durability of the straps prevent strain on her 
shoulders.
Crisostomo and Gonzales met 
each other through mutual friends 
because they both went to nearby 
high schools in Orlando. Gonza-
lez eagerly supported Crisostomo 
through her various entrepreneurial 
endeavors.
Some of Crisostomo’s future 
ideas for growth include hiring 
people to help with the workload 
and starting a website. She said 
she already hired her 16-year-old brother in Orlando to help sew 
some of the straps for the bags.
Her mother, Victoria Crisostomo, 
53, traveled from Orlando with their 
dog, Sasha, to support her for her 
ﬁ  rst Indie Flea. She has been closely 
involved with Crisostomo’s endeav-
ors and even participates in the bag 
construction when possible.
Victoria taught Crisostomo how 
to sew when she was about 8 years 
old and she is happy to see both of 
her kids utilizing the skill.  
“It’s like a sweatshop when we’re all home with all of the 
sewing machines,” Victoria said. 
“When she’s home for a few days, 
the house blows up.”
Moving forward, Crisostomo 
said she is excited to continue 
sharing a product that encourages 
people to practice more sustainable 
lifestyles.
Crisostomo releases new bags 
every Friday at 5 p.m. on the Re-
deﬁ  ned Goods Instagram account, 
@redeﬁ  nedgoods. Customers can 
claim their favorite bag by being the 
ﬁ  rst to comment in each post.

ABOUT 30 
PEOPLE ATTENDED
By Morgan Goldwich
Avenue Staff Writer
The Civic Media Center hosted 
its ﬁ  rst open mic of the semester last 
week, focusing on Afrofuturism.
Afrofuturism intersects specula-
tive ﬁ  ction and technology with re-
gard to black culture, African Ameri-
can studies librarian Stephanie Birch 
said. She represented Smathers Li-
brary at the event.
Afrofuturism spans multimedia 
platforms and is multigenerational, 
she said, and there has been a long 
history of the genre.
“It’s the product of black imagi-
nation,” she explained. “Imagination 
about what kind of futures can exist 
[for black people].”  
Other local organizations tabling 
at the event included UF’s Queer 
Trans People of Color Collective and 
Dream Defenders.
Ashley Wallace was the coordina-tor of the event, although she calls 
herself a “people mover.” 
She said the open mic nights have 
been recurring since 2014 on the last 
Tuesday of each month. Since it 
aligns with the school year, this was 
the ﬁ  rst one since spring.
Throughout the night, over six lo-
cal black poets and songwriters took 
the stage.
Kayla Rodney was the spotlight 
feature artist of the night. 
“[People] make her mad at work, 
and she makes art,” Wallace said 
when introducing Rodney’s perfor-
mance. “She makes gold. That’s Af-
rofuturism.”
Rodney said she started writing 
poetry in high school. Now 26, she 
said she enjoys what it “means” to 
write poetry.
“It’s an expression of who I am as 
a person,” she said. A major theme 
in her work is what it’s like to live in 
the world as a black woman.
Though she is originally from 
Louisiana, she feels she was adopted 
into the Gainesville community.“A lot of my work involves water, 
ever since Hurricane Katrina,” she 
said. “I didn’t realize that until it was 
pointed out to me.”
She said she doesn’t consider Af-
rofuturism to be futuristic, but rather 
a vision of what a safe world would 
be like for black people.
“It’s important to have the space 
for black residents to come together 
and have a safe exploration of black 
utopia,” she said.
Her 20-minute set featured sev-
eral spoken-word poems, which she 
said is not necessarily her forte.
“I call myself a page poet who 
happens to be onstage once in a 
while,” she said.
Wallace said the Civic Media 
Center likes doing themed nights 
when partnering with UF to bring 
people in.
“We’re trying to bridge the gap 
between students and locals,” she 
said.

FOOTBALL
By Kyle Wood
Sports Writer
For the second time this year, Florida 
dropped in the AP Top 25 Poll after a win.
The ﬁ  rst time it happened was in the ﬁ  rst 
poll of the regular season, which came two 
weeks after UF’s 24-20 win in Orlando over 
Miami. The Gators slid from No. 8 to No. 11 
despite beating a Hurricanes team that re-
ceived votes to be in the top 25 on a neutral 
ﬁ  eld. This past week, Florida fell one spot 
from No. 9 to No. 10 after soundly beating 
Towson 38-0.
“Everybody seems to kind of treat us like 
we’re really not a top-10 team even though 
we are,” kicker Evan McPherson said.
UF could solidify its place in the top 10, 
or slide out of the rankings entirely in the 
next few weeks. It all starts with a top-10 
bout with No. 7 Auburn at home Saturday 
at 3:30 p.m.
In their ﬁ  rst game this season as an un-
derdog, the Gators still feel like they're the 
favorite.“A lot of people think that we haven’t 
played anybody, every week our ranking 
goes up and down, they don’t think we’re 
capable to be a top-10 team,” defensive 
back Trey Dean said. “So we’re just going to 
have to show them.”
Dean went as far as to say this game has 
College Football Playoff implications, and 
he could be right.
It’s crowded at the top, especially in the 
SEC, which is home to ﬁ  ve teams ranked 
in the top 10. Florida will play three of the 
other four teams in the next four weeks, in 
addition to Auburn, including No. 5 LSU 
and No. 3 Georgia. 
Defensive lineman Kyree Campbell ex-
pressed his ambivalence for the Gators’ 
movement in the polls.
“They dropped us, oh well,” he said. 
“They don’t respect us, oh well.”
Pollsters will have no choice but to re-
spect UF if it performs in this brutal stretch. 
According to ESPN’s Football Power In-
dex, the Gators have the hardest remain-
ing schedule in the nation. Conversely, UF 
has played the 59th-hardest schedule in the country to date, according to ESPN’s CFP 
picture. Florida’s defense is also back to full 
health for the ﬁ  rst time since UT Martin. 
Cornerback C.J. Henderson and defensive 
end Jabari Zuniga are both expected to re-
turn this weekend. 
The Tigers, on the other hand, have 
played the seventh-hardest. Both teams are 
in the top 10 in strength of schedule, though.
Auburn presents a series of unique chal-
lenges Florida hasn’t seen all season.
The Tigers already have two top-25 wins 
on their resume. They also possess a dy-
namic offense (ranked in the top 25 in scor-
ing offense and rushing offense) and stingy 
defense (top 25 in scoring defense and rush-
ing defense).
There’s no better place for the Gators 
to prove themselves — right or wrong — 
than this weekend against Auburn with the 
spotlight of College GameDay and a raucous 
crowd in the Swamp.
@Kkylewood
kwood@alligator.orgGators view Auburn game as a chance to silence the noise
A bobbled snap.
When Auburn played 
then-No. 2 Florida in 
2006, the game was a 
wild one. A defensive 
matchup for much of the ﬁ  rst half, 
UF was up 17-11 in the third quar-
ter when senior punter Eric Wilbur 
lined up for a punt to ﬂ  ip the ﬁ  eld 
and pin the Tigers deep in their 
own territory.
But Wilbur bobbled the snap, and corralled it 
too late, causing his feeble attempt to kick it to 
be blocked and returned for a touchdown, giving 
then-No. 11 Auburn a lead it would not give up 
in the eventual 27-17 win over UF.
A bobbled snap on special teams helped de-
cide the game in 2006. A last-second Auburn 
ﬁ  eld goal decided it in 2007. And whether you 
like it or not, special teams will once again be 
critical this Saturday.
Florida and Auburn’s defenses come into the 
matchup ranked 17th and 33rd, respectively, in 
total defense with two inexperienced quarter-
backs — Florida’s Kyle Trask, who has started 
two games in his collegiate career, and Auburn’s 
Bo Nix, who has started ﬁ  ve.
Both teams will look to pound the ball on the 
ground and try to wear down the defenses, espe-
cially Auburn, who ranks No. 14 in rush offense. 
Chances are, it won’t work.
That’s where special teams comes in.
Florida will need every yard that punter Tom-
my Townsend can lay into his kicks to ﬂ  ip the 
ﬁ  eld the same way Wilbur tried to do 13 years 
ago when the offense isn’t working. Hopefully, he has better hands.
“I remember watching the 
game,” Florida’s punter said of the 
2006 game. “I always kind of hated 
Auburn growing up, because I re-
member losing that game. So, this 
is one that sits a little heavy in me. 
So, I’m going to come out there 
with an edge and try and put out a 
good performance.”
Townsend’s hands will be es-
sential for punting and for holding sophomore 
Evan McPherson’s kicks.
McPherson’s strong right leg that has made 
six of his seven attempts this year will match up 
against Auburn’s Anders Carlson, brother of for-
mer Auburn and current Oakland Raiders kicker 
Daniel, who’s made ﬁ  ve of his six kicks this year.
If the defenses clamp down, this top-10 
matchup could be decided by which kicker is 
better in the clutch.
There’s a lot building up to this game, and 
everyone is hoping for a shootout of epic propor-
tions. Players for UF have voiced their frustra-
tions that they feel disrespected after the latest 
AP poll moved them down to No. 10 despite re-
maining undefeated.
The Gators will have a big opportunity to 
snap a three-game losing streak to the Tigers, 
but it won’t be the barn burner everyone wants.
It won’t be as exciting. It won’t be what peo-
ple hoped for, but special teams will decide this 
contest. The game will drag, and offenses will 
stagnate in another classic SEC defensive game.
And the special teams better prepare for a 
long day’s work.Special teams will decide UF - AU gameHeroes and Dylans

attention to critics who say it isn't top-10 caliber.
VOLLEYBALL
By Mari Faiello
Sports Writer
For the second week in 
a row, Florida’s volleyball 
team ranks 12th in the na-
tion, according to the most 
recent AVCA poll.
And although the 
Gators’ ranking remains 
consistent, their play 
doesn't as the team nearly 
hits the halfway point in 
their season with 13 games 
marked off and another 16 
to go.
Coach Mary Wise has 
harped on her team for its 
lack of consistency over 
the past couple of weeks. 
Without any freshmen on 
her roster, she is pointing 
ﬁ  ngers at her veterans.
And the players are 
pointing at themselves, 
too.
“Our team right now, 
we’re a team that likes to 
feel our way into matches 
before we start playing 
well,” libero Allie Gregory 
said after Florida’s 3-1 win 
against Georgia on Sun-
day. “We’re working on 
that…We just have to get 
a little quicker at it.”
The matchup against 
the Bulldogs was a good example at the kind of 
inconsistency the Gators 
(11-2, 2-0 SEC) are facing 
two games deep into con-
ference play, with a road 
game at Kentucky on the 
schedule for Sunday.
The Gators couldn’t get 
their feet off the ground in 
the opening frame against 
Georgia, leading many to 
believe the Bulldogs had 
the match in their pocket.
Florida struggled to ﬁ  nd 
the open court and make 
adjustments on the right-
side, especially against 
Georgia freshman outside 
hitter Kacie Evans, who 
matched her career-high 
16 kills on the game.
The Gators came back 
and won the second set, 
but struggled again in the 
third set, trailing 19-11 be-
fore getting some momen-
tum to come back and take 
the set 25-23, up two sets 
to one against the Bull-
dogs.
Consistency will be key 
for Florida as the team 
takes on a seasoned 15th-
ranked Wildcats team (9-
4, 2-0 SEC) in Lexington, 
Kentucky. Two of the 
four matches the Wildcats 
have dropped this season 
have gone to ﬁ  ve sets. The Gators have two ﬁ  ve-set 
matches on their resume, 
as well. However, both 
ended in wins in Florida’s 
case.
Florida’s inconsistency 
also came into play during 
one of those ﬁ  ve-set wins 
against Long Beach State. 
The Gators were slow 
to move on the match, 
dropping the ﬁ  rst set 27-
25 before coming back to 
take the next two frames. 
The fourth set favored the 
Beach by six before the 
ﬁ  fth set amped up 19-17 in 
Florida’s favor.
Multiple attack errors 
and slow adjustments on 
the block played a role in 
that early season match.
“I think it’s what all 
teams are striving for,” 
Wise said. “In that, it isn’t 
easy to perform at your top 
level in every serve of ev-
ery rally. 
“So, what you’re trying 
to do is, you may not be at 
that level, but can you just 
avoid the low peaks. And 
that is what consistency 
is.”

Fifty-three votes. 
Florida soccer hasn’t been ranked 
all season. At the start of September, 
the Gators were not particularly close 
to sneaking into the top 25, either. UF 
was in the midst of what became a 
four-game losing streak. 
Now, after defeating Vanderbilt 
1-0 on Sunday, Florida is one spot 
shy of the list, receiving more than 
double the ranking votes of any other 
team left out. 
In Monday’s United Soccer 
Coaches’ poll, the Gators were left off 
the list, but they were the ﬁ  rst team 
out. Florida received 53 votes to be 
ranked in the top 25, while the sec-
ond most votes (Rutgers) received 
24. 
A ranking will come for UF if it 
continues to make the win column 
longer, however. This Sunday pits UF 
against No. 12 Texas A&M at Donald 
R. Dizney Stadium in Gainesville. 
Coach Becky Burleigh’s squad will 
begin that match having won its last 
ﬁ  ve. Furthermore, UF has now won 
three games in a row in-conference 
and boasts a 3-0 SEC record. 
Here’s what the Gators need to 
continue to do to continue their win-
ning ways:
Feed Cassidy Lindley
While the most dynamic player 
in the orange and blue is Deanne 
Rose, Cassidy Lindley has been bril-
liant lately in both stringing together 
attacks for her teammates as well as 
ripping shots of her own. She may 
only have one goal on the season, 
but it became the game-winner on 
Sunday against the Commodores.
More importantly, her threat to 
strike from the top of the 18-yard 
box has forced defenders to step up 
further than they’re comfortable with and has allowed strikers like Kouri 
Peace and Vanessa Kara more space 
closer to goal. 
Wait for Rose
Ever since the Aug. 29 loss to 
USC, Rose has struggled to get back 
on the ﬁ  eld with a hamstring injury 
for long periods of time. It is also im-
portant to note that she plays for the 
Canadian national team. She ﬂ  ew to 
Tokyo immediately after the game in 
Nashville, Tennessee, to face Japan 
in a friendly. 
Her availability should look bet-
ter for the rest of the season as far 
as national team duties, but that will 
be irrelevant if her hamstring is still 
injured. While UF has enjoyed suc-
cess in Rose’s absence, its potential 
to beat top-tier teams shrinks dra-
matically without the most dynamic 
athlete on the roster. 
Push Kit Loferski down the right 
wing
The right back is ironically of 
more value for UF on the offensive 
side of the pitch. Kit Loferski’s speed 
down the right side during counter-
attacks is noticeably problematic for 
opposing defenses, and like Lind-
ley, she forces defenders out of the 
18. That allows Kara more space up 
top and Peace more space on the left 
wing to cut in and shoot with a right-
footed strike. 
These elements have been there 
for the Gators recently, and they’re 
stacking wins. It seems that the 
Gators and Burleigh understand the 
type of team that they are now, and 
have used their weapons better.

It was a forgettable Final Round 
for both the Gators men’s and 
women’s golf teams.
Both of Florida’s squads 
struggled Tuesday en route to over 
par team totals that dropped them 
down their respective leaderboards.
In Chicago, the women were 
18 holes away from securing their 
second win of the season at the 
Windy City Collegiate. Sitting 
one shot clear of next-best South 
Carolina, the No. 6 Gators were 
overcome with costly over-par 
rounds on a day when the rest 
of the ﬁ  eld scored signiﬁ  cantly 
lower. Florida’s ﬁ  nal round 292 (4 
over) was the only team score in 
black ﬁ  gures among the top seven 
programs on the leaderboard.“It just looked like we got ahead 
of ourselves,” women’s coach 
Emily Glaser said in a release. “It 
was a classic case of trying too 
hard, and the harder we tried, the 
more we got in our own way.”
Despite the outcome of 
Tuesday’s ﬁ  nal round, the Gators 
can take solace in a third-place 
ﬁ  nish on a demanding course like 
Glen View Club. 
Strong individual performances 
from senior Sierra Brooks – who 
carded a two-under 70 in the 
Final Round to snag second place 
individually – and juniors Addie 
Baggarly and Elin Esborn should 
also soften the agony of losing an 
overnight lead.
For the men’s squad, a lackluster 
Final Round performance sent it 
home with more questions than 
answers.At the Nike Golf Collegiate 
Invite, UF combined for a ﬁ  nal 
round 293 (9 over), tied with host 
Oregon for the highest third round 
total of the 15 teams in the ﬁ  eld.
Freshman Ricky Castillo 
provided the lone spark for the 
Gators on Tuesday. His one-under 
70 was enough to tie for 15th at 
Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club. No other 
teammate signed for a ﬁ  nal round 
under par, and Florida stumbled 
one spot down the leaderboard to 
ﬁ  nish 13th of 15 teams.
A near three-week hiatus 
awaits the Gators, which should 
be enough time to sort out any 
ﬂ  aws and lineup struggles before 
the last tournament of the fall: the 
Tavistock Collegiate Invitational.
