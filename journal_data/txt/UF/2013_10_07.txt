FLORIDA 30 ARKANSAS 10
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
In the ﬁ  rst night game at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium in nearly two years, Tyler Murphy 
shut out the lights.
The redshirt junior quarterback led No. 
18 Florida (4-1, 3-0 Southeastern Confer-ence) to a 30-10 win against Arkansas (3-3, 0-2 SEC) in The Swamp on Saturday night.
“He did a great job of ﬁ  nding the win-
dow, stepping up and buying a little bit of time,” coach Will Muschamp said.
After Brad Phillips kicked a ﬁ  eld goal 
and Loucheiz Purifoy returned an intercep-tion for a touchdown to give the Gators a 10-7 lead, Murphy ensured the Razorbacks would not make a comeback.
On third and 12 with time ticking off 
the clock in the second quarter, Murphy dropped back and Arkansas’ defense quickly pressured him. The redshirt junior stepped up in the pocket and delivered a strike to wide receiver Solomon Patton, who had his back to the end zone.
Patton made the catch just beyond the 
ﬁ  rst-down marker and turned it into a 51-yard touchdown. The senior darted past Arkansas cornerback Tevin Mitchel and outran three other defenders en route to the end zone, putting Florida up 17-7 with only 20 seconds left in the ﬁ  rst half.
“I take a lot of pride in [getting yards af-
ter the catch],” Patton said. “I really focus on that in practice. After I make a catch, I make sure I get a good 5-to-10-yard burst.”
Murphy and Patton continued their con-
nection later in the game.
On the Gators’ ﬁ  rst drive of the third 
quarter, Murphy found Patton for a 38-yard touchdown. 
The senior caught the pass at about the 
30-yard line — losing Mitchel as he made the reception — and bolted toward the sideline.
Patton broke one tackle at the 10-yard 
line, juked past safety Eric Bennett and dashed into the end zone for his second touchdown of the game.
“We haven’t had a night game in two 
years,” Patton said, “so (it was) just a great feeling to perform like that.”
Patton ﬁ  nished with six catches for a 
career-high 124 yards, leading the team in catches, yards and receiving touchdowns. Aided by Patton’s running, Murphy ended his second career start with 16 completions on 22 attempts for 240 yards.
“We have a little momentum going,” 
Murphy said. “And we’re just going to keep building on that, and hopefully he just continues to make plays.”
It was surprising to see the passing game 
take precedence, as both Florida and Ar-kansas rely on running the ball on offense.
However, both run defenses were stout. RAZOR SHARP

� DESPITE 44 BEING EJECTED, 
NO STUDENTS WERE ARRESTED DURING SATURDAY’S GAME.

At the UF vs. Arkansas game, the 
number of fan ejections set the season’s 
high mark so far.
On Saturday, 85 attendees were 
ejected — 44 of which were students. Additionally, four people were arrest-ed, but none were students, according to a University Police release.
When UF played Tennessee on Sept. 
21, 62 people were ejected, and only one attendee was arrested. Twenty-ﬁ  ve people were ejected and three people were arrested during the season-open-ing game Aug. 31.
Out of the number of people ejected 
Saturday, 12 were for alcohol posses-sion in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. Those individuals were also issued civil cita-tions by UPD.
Sixteen people were ejected for in-
toxication, one person was ousted for ﬁ  ghting, and another was ejected for marijuana possession, according to the release. 
Seven people were forced out for 
ticket-switching, six people were eject-ed for being in the wrong section, and nine were put out for using false IDs.
Of the four arrests, three were for 
disorderly conduct, and one was for trespassing after a warning, according to the release.Game ejections, arrests upCAMPUS
STAFF REPORT
A Jacksonville pilot and his passenger 
are expected to recover after their banner 
plane crashed on UF’s campus Saturday af-ternoon. 
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce and 
Gainesville Police’s Joint Aviation Unit will conduct an investigation to ﬁ  nd out why the plane went down. 
ASO spokesman Art Forgey on Sunday 
said the unit will handle the case for the Federal Aviation Administration because of the ongoing government shutdown. 
Graham A. Hill, 28, and Ian Conrad, 26, 
were ﬂ  ying a Cessna 172F Skyhawk above campus at about 4 p.m. when they “experi-enced trouble” and had to make an emer-gency landing, ofﬁ  cials said. 
The plane towed a large banner, and Hill 
decided to cut it loose. He tried to make an emergency landing on Flavet Field, but the plane bounced off of the ground and crashed into an unoccupied Ford pickup truck near the stage. Ambulances later took them to UF Health Shands Hospital.
The plane — built in 1965 — is registered 
to Beach Banners Inc., a Jacksonville-based Police to investigate Saturday 
plane crash near Flavet Field

cording to FAA records. 
Beach Banners representatives 
could not be reached for com-ment. 
News of the plane crash cir-
culated around Gainesville and eventually reached Hill’s family in Jacksonville. 
George Hill, the pilot’s fa-
ther, said he and his family were proud of their son for making the emergency landing without hurt-ing anyone. He said police on the scene called the move “heroic.”
“We’re happy to be talking 
about this in a good way instead of a tragic way,” George Hill said. “(Graham) took the road of ‘I’m going to crash the plane before I hit anyone.’”
UPD Chief Linda Stump 
praised Hill for landing the plane safely despite the area being oc-cupied by tailgaters. “(Hill) did everything he 
could under the circumstances,” she said Saturday, adding that she was glad the crash happened several hours before the Gator football game instead of closer to or during it. 
Several witnesses at the scene 
said the crash happened in fewer than 10 seconds.
Daniel Knuth, a 23-year-old 
UF alumnus from Orlando was tailgating on Flavet when the plane hit the ground and skidded into the truck.
“It sounded like a big crash,” 
he said.
He also saw Hill and Conrad 
get out of the wreckage with bloody hands and heads, and later, saw ambulances take them away.
Paige Kauffman, a 22-year-
old UF journalism senior, said she was on Fraternity Row when she saw the plane before it went down. 
“I saw the propeller just stop, 
and I knew it was about to crash,” she said.
With more than 2,500 hours 
of ﬂ  ight experience, Saturday’s crash was not Graham Hill’s ﬁ  rst emergency landing.
On New Year’s Eve, he took 
his girlfriend for a ﬂ  ight over downtown Jacksonville to watch ﬁ  reworks and was forced to land after a stray bullet shot through a side window and grazed his head.
In a YouTube video posted 
earlier this year,  Hill explains he and his girlfriend heard a “loud pop” inside the cockpit. He then found the bullet hole and told his girlfriend they had been shot at. 
“Just as I said that, I felt blood 
run down my neck,” he said in the video.
Hill steered the plane toward 
Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport and had his girlfriend take over the ﬂ  ight control. Once they landed, Hill was treated for his injuries. 
An investigation later revealed 
the bullet came from a gun ﬁ  red from someone 1,200 feet below where Hill and his girlfriend were ﬂ  ying. The bullet went through the side window, hit the back of Hill’s head and shot out of plane’s roof. 
Graham Hill found his passion 
for ﬂ  ying when he was a child, his father said. 
He grew up near neighbors 
who worked as pilots. In his early 20s, he obtained his pilot’s license and used his certiﬁ  cation to track whale and dolphin movements off Florida’s coasts for the gov-ernment.
“He’s done quite a job at it,” 
George Hill said. 
Fred Anderson, a 73-year-old 
a retired factory supervisor from Jacksonville, has lived near the Hill family since he moved to Seabrook Cove Road about 15 years ago. 
He remembered the bullet in-
cident and called Hill’s second emergency landing within the last year a “big coincidence.”
“It was bad luck as far as I’m 
concerned,” he said. “I don’t be-lieve he brought anything on himself. It’s amazing these things happen to him.”MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Other activities at the farm 
include pasture putt-putt, corn-hole board games, car-nival games and a pumpkin patch.Amy Perryman, owner of 
Coon Hollo, said her original goal was to transform the fam-ily farm into a community-oriented agricultural environ-ment.
“It’s a family event for ev-

UF Hillel is challenging students 
to walk the length of Israel.
Participants will walk 296 miles 
around campus, which reflects the 
distance from Eilat, the southern-most point of Israel, to the northern city of Haifa.
Although Haifa is not the north-
ernmost point of Israel, there is a connection between UF and Haifa because many UF students have studied abroad at the University of Haifa, said UF Hillel Engagement Associate Melissa Kansky.
“The two cities will resonate 
well,” Kansky said. “Having this connection helps with realizing the distance and how small the country really is.”
The event began last week. This 
is a chance to maintain students’ connections to Israel in their busy lives, she said.
According to Google Maps, the 
walk from Eilat to Haifa will take about 97 hours. Kansky said the first 40 participants who signed up for the walk were given a pedom-eter to track their miles.
Lauren Friedman, UF Hillel pub-
lic relations student director, said “Walk Across Israel” will help stu-dents keep Israel in their thoughts on a daily basis.
“I think not only will it keep stu-
dents aware of Israel, but it will also remind them how important com-munity and exercise are,” said the 21-year-old public relations senior. “It is amazing that Hillel is provid-ing a program that not only gets students talking about Israel but also encourages them to exercise alongside their friends.”      
Kansky said there are prizes 
for students as they reach distance goals. Once participants walk the 195 miles to reach Jerusalem from Eilat, Hillel will host a falafel night. There will also be a party for when students reach the 212-mile mark, the distance to Tel Aviv, Israel’s party capital. Students have the op-portunity to run the stadiums for an extra challenge in light of the hike to the summit of Mountain Masada.
The walk encourages students to 
appreciate Jewish value, and it also enforces exercise and a healthy life-style, Friedman said.
Although UF Hillel is hosting 
“Walk Across Israel,” the program is open to all students from di-verse religious and cultural back-grounds.
“The event will connect students 
to Jewish life in a way that fits their interests by creating and modify-ing a Jewish program that matches their habits,” Kansky said. “They won’t be limited to being inside of Hillel, and they can take their Juda-ism and culture outside.”

At the UF College of Medicine, 
one plastic surgeon is working with 
the Department of Defense to find a new way to heal wounded soldiers more effectively.
Dr. Adam Katz, associate profes-
sor in the department of surgery in the College of Medicine, said the $1.2 million grant awarded allows him to expand on work he started in 2008.
He said he hopes to separate and 
harness the regenerative cells from the fat tissue, as it is a tissue most people can easily give away.  
His idea is to combine the cell’s 
healing properties with other com-ponents to create a toothpaste-like substance that can be spread on the wounds. 
Currently, traumatic accidents 
with skin and tissue loss are typi-cally treated with either skin grafts or a flap surgery, both of which are major surgeries.
But both processes heal one part 
of the body while taking from an-other, creating new scars.“Many people would rather have 
their fat sucked out than have me make more scars on their face,” Katz said. 
Retired U.S. Army Col. Donnie 
Horner Jr., of Jacksonville, said any treatment that enables a wounded soldier to return faster is welcome.
Soldiers do not mind taking risks, 
he said, but they are always worried about the unknown.
Military medical advancements 
often help pioneer medical advance-ments for civilians, Horner said.
Dr. Bruce Mast, chief of plastic 
and reconstructive surgery at UF Health, said this treatment could help any trauma patient, including cancer patients who have tumors re-moved.
“If this really works out,” he said, 
“this could be a big game changer.”UF studies skin treatments

GatorWell Health Promo-
tion Services has revamped 
its anti-interpersonal violence group.
STRIVE, Sexual Trauma/
Interpersonal Violence Educa-tion, was initially under the UF’s Counseling & Wellness Center but is now run by Ga-torWell.
Julia Rae Varnes, GatorWell 
health promotion specialist, said STRIVE will be releasing new sexual assault prevention videos, conducting presenta-tions and creating a new logo to raise awareness and educate students about rape prevention techniques.
Maureen Miller, director of 
GatorWell, said she has been working with Gainesville Po-lice Capt. Lynne Benck. 
Benck formed a committee 
last summer that includes Uni-versity Police, Santa Fe College and the UF Office of Victim Ser-vices.
Miller said the committee 
identifies strategies to address alcohol-related sexual assaults among students. The com-mittee created its first public-service-announcement videos displaying examples of positive bystander behavior.
The first video highlights 
a male in the bystander role, and the second video shows two females sharing the same role. The clips show an intoxi-cated woman at a party being harassed by a man who is be-ing persistent about taking her home.
Miller said the committee 
collaborated with the UF Col-lege of Journalism and Com-munications to produce the two videos, hoping it will encour-age students to step in when needed.
She said STRIVE’s intensive 
plan will make the organization a more recognizable resource available to students on cam-pus and make sexual-assault prevention part of a broader discussion in the community.
This summer, STRIVE re-
searched programs at other universities across the country to come up with a three-year plan of short-term and long-term goals, Miller said.

Residents were told not to panic. They were 
told to stay indoors and keep their guns in their cases. But there was a large lizard on the loose in Alachua County, and its owner and the sheriff’s office didn’t know how to stop it. The 3-foot-long monitor lizard had escaped from its home in a researcher’s greenhouse. It made it two blocks down the road, climbed 30 feet up a tree and then escaped sheriff deputy clutches.
Oct. 8, 1986Downtown Gainesville was in chaos, and it 
wasn’t drunk club-goers that were the problem this time. Joel Brault, who was in the middle of a divorce, came to City Hall and waited in his car for his wife to get off of work. It isn’t clear who originally had a gun, but Brault ended up shoot-ing his wife four times, once in the face, and then himself. The police said there was no apparent motive for the murder-suicide besides their di-vorce proceedings. 
Oct. 10, 1997A 12-year-old girl toyed with trouble one fate-

Victim Felicia Hines said she was cursed at and asked how she would feel if she blew her eyes out. She said she didn’t know the gun was fake until she reported the incident to the police.

The third annual Allen L. 
Poucher lecture series Friday did 
not include Sen. Bill Nelson as planned due to the government shutdown. 
But American University law 
professor Kenneth Anderson, Sen. Bob Graham, retired Gener-al James T. Hill and Texas A&M University government and pub-lic service lecturer James Olson did attend. 
They spoke to about 500 peo-
ple at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. 
The discussion, hosted by the 
Florida Law Review, included topics such as the United States’ involvement in Syria and Af-ghanistan, efforts to thwart mod-ern terrorism, the inevitability of a terrorist attack on the U.S. and the dangers of biological and chemical weapons.
Mike Polatsek, a 27-year-old 
third-year law student and co-executive symposium editor for the Florida Law Review, said each speaker brought a unique viewpoint.
“When you have an event that 
goes over an hour and a half, you start losing people’s attention,” Polatsek said. “They held peo-ple’s attention really well.”
He said the Poucher lectures 
were created in honor of Allen L. Poucher Sr., so prominent legal, political and business leaders can come to UF and speak to students about current events.
He said the speakers weren’t 
paid an honorarium outside of covered travel expenses and meals. 
“We just called them and asked 
them if they were interested in coming, and they all said yes,” he said. “It was pretty amazing.”
He said all the speakers felt 
very strongly about bringing na-tional security to the forefront of peoples’ minds, which is part of the reason they agreed to come to the campus with no payment.
Anderson and Hill closed

Moe’s Southwest Grill thought a 
Newberry woman’s Three Bears Salsa 
wasn’t too hot, or too mild, but in fact, was just right.
Cheryl Gallowitz, a veterinary tech-
nician at the UF Large Animal Hospital, won the Moe’s Raise the Salsa Bar con-test more than a year ago, and her salsa finally debuted nationwide last week.
The salsa gets its name from the Gol-
dilocks children’s story, said Gallowitz, because it’s the right balance between hot and mild.
“When I was trying batches and hav-
ing my friends test it out, I kept hearing ‘Oh, it’s perfect,’ and ‘Oh, it’s just right’,” she said. “That’s what brought in the fairytale connotation of Goldilocks.”
Gallowitz said she doesn’t cook, but 
she used the contest to create a salsa similar to one she used to like when she lived in New York City.
“I have no culinary skills,” she said. “This was something I did to recreate salsa I enjoyed so much in the restau-rant from home.”
Gallowitz said the secret to her sal-
sa’s success is ensuring all of the ingre-dients, which include diced tomatoes, green pepper and pickled jalapeños, are fresh.
Brad Chasteen, the owner of the 
Moe’s at 3443 SW Archer Road, said he is proud the winner of the contest is from the Gainesville area.
“It’s wonderful that we can have the 
focus of the entire brand in Gainesville,” he said. “Having your customers be a part of the creative process is cool.”
The Three Bears Salsa will be avail-
able at all Moe’s locations for six months, but Chasteen said if it is successful, it could become a staple.
“If it’s extremely popular — and 
we’ll see how the customers and coun-try like it — there’s a possibility it could stay forever and be part of the Moe’s salsa rotation,” he said.Gainesville salsa at Moe’s� CALIFORNIA RECENTLY BECAME 
THE SECOND STATE TO OUTLAW IT. KRISTINA RAMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Revenge porn, sharing nude images online 
without the subject’s consent, has become a 
growing concern as disgruntled lovers share in-timate photos obtained during a romantic rela-tionship. Some revenge porn websites identify the subjects by name or even provide links to their social media accounts.  
On Tuesday, California became the second 
state to outlaw revenge porn. New Jersey was the first. California Senate Bill 255 classifies the practice as a misdemeanor, punishable by fines and time in prison. Similar laws have failed to pass in Missouri and Florida.
State Sen. David Simmons of Altamonte 
Springs filed Florida’s version of the bill, SB 946, which died in the appropriations process earlier this year. 
“These pictures are not published for pur-
poses of art,” he said. “They are published for purposes of hurt.”
Currently, revenge porn websites are pro-
tected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, an immunity provision that pro-tects websites from being responsible for the content posted by its users, said UF law profes-sor Lyrissa Lidsky.  
Although courts are able to interpret the law 
more narrowly, the immunity provision could only be changed by Congress, not at the state level.
Lidsky said some opponents of revenge 
porn legislation feel the proposed laws would infringe on the First Amendment.
“Generally, I’m opposed to new legislation 
that effects free speech, but this is so dramatic,” Lidsky said. 
Not all victims of revenge porn are com-
pletely without recourse. Certain cyberstalking and cyberharrassment laws can apply, Lidsky said. Other protections exist for photos that are inherently illegal, such as images obtained through hacking or images involving a minor. 
The California bill hasn’t solved all of these 
concerns, though. The law rests on the intent to cause serious emotional distress, a point that may be hard to prove, Lidsky said. 
Simmons said Florida may yet pass specific 
laws about revenge porn in the future. Before its defeat, SB 946 was approved unanimously by both the Criminal Justice Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee.Revenge porn still legal in Florida“The way they explained 
that drones protect 
American lives by putting 
them out of harm’s way was 
pretty cool.”

‘Game of Thrones’  
Why stories matter 
On Tuesday, Stevie Nicks told the Herald Scotland that 
she turned to the HBO series “Game of Thrones” to cope with the death of her mother and a nasty bout 
of pneumonia. She was crippled with grief, and she told the Herald she couldn’t leave her house for nearly ﬁ  ve months. In that time period, she immersed herself in George R. R. Mar-tin’s fantasy world of Westeros and wrote poems about the characters — some of the titles “On Jon Snow,” “On Arya” and “On Cersei and Jaime,” she said.
Nicks also said she’d be willing to collaborate with the 
producers to write music for the show. We’re hoping HBO jumps on this opportunity — Nicks’ dreamy, ethereal sound would ﬁ  t perfectly into a scene with Daenerys Targaryen.
“The author (George R. R. Martin) is my age, and it blows 
my mind that he’s able to create this vast, interlinked world,” Nicks told the Herald. “As a songwriter I write little movies. But I can’t imagine sitting down and writing even one small book. But then probably somebody like him couldn’t imagine writing ‘Edge Of Seventeen’ or ‘Rhiannon’ — couldn’t write a whole little life in two verses and a chorus.’”
Though Martin’s novels, with his sprawling fantasy 
worlds, and Nicks’ songs, about love and loss, seem to be on totally separate planes, they’ve both helped their fans escape reality for years.
Nicks, during both her early years with Fleetwood Mac 
and her solo career, was well-known for her skills as a live singer. She’s transported audiences for decades during shows with her signature ﬂ  owing gypsy gowns and gorgeous set pieces.
And the worlds Martin has created are just as immersive 
as a Fleetwood Mac or Stevie Nicks concert — hence his fan base of obsessive readers who have been known to name their children after characters in his books.
Even with the advent of the Internet and the ability to 
fact-check every movie, book, song or TV show for scientiﬁ  c or historical authenticity, stories — even wildly outlandish ones— have an undeniable appeal.
“Technology makes authenticity suspect, and technology 
gives us the wherewithal to demand it — if that’s what we really want,” Wired contributor Frank Rose wrote. “Except that it’s not what we want. It’s what we think we want . . . We want to be sucked inside the computer like Jeff Bridges in ‘Tron.’ We want to be immersed in something that’s not real at all.”
It makes sense, then, that Stevie Nicks would relate to Mar-
tin’s work and relish the immersive culture of high-fantasy ﬁ  ction. Her love of “Game of Thrones” and our love of Stevie Nicks all boils down to storytelling and the thrill of losing ourselves in worlds vastly different to our own.
Mugshot websites shouldn’t make money 
It could happen to anyone — you had one too many 
beers, forgot to turn on your headlights on the way home and got stopped by police. Next thing you 
know, you’re in the county jail, grimacing into a camera — your very ﬁ  rst “mugshot.” 
We all make mistakes. We learn from them and in 
the best case scenario, we move on.  
But when our own embarrassing decisions become 
a public record, available on the Internet, they become lifelong stains that are nearly impossible to clean. 
A New York Times article published online Saturday 
looked into a for-proﬁ  t industry that is growing in num-bers, dollars and search-engine optimization. Websites like justmugshots.com and ﬂ  orida.arrests.org aggregate content from law enforcement sites and republish crimi-nal arrest information. 
It’s a public service — people can go on these da-
tabases to ﬁ  nd out if their blind date has a tainted re-cord or if their potential employee is less immaculate than they seem on a resume. Arrest records are public information, and anyone is free to divulge it. That’s the way the constitutional ﬁ  rst amendment protects these websites. 
The content on these sites is not considered slander 
because the information is true. But while this civic ser-vice is considered legitimate, the money-making strate-gies employed by mugshot-aggregating sites is concern-ing, to say the least. It’s borderline extortion.
To get your picture taken down from these sites, The 
New York Times’ David Segal reported, you might have to pay up to $400, possibly more in special cases. 
For the college kid who is applying to his or her 
ﬁ  rst job, that sum can seem hefty but necessary. Most employers, when considering an applicant, perform Google background checks. When all you can do is call yourself an idiot a thousand times for driving home that one night with your headlights off, you’d do anything to rid any trace of it on the In-ternet. Since 2010, a few savvy entrepreneurs have taken up the opportunity, charging peo-ple to get their virtual record expunged.
Criminal arrests are public 
record, but the business of al-lowing people to pay off their 
humiliation is wrong. 
People who can afford to spend a few hundred dol-
lars to absolve themselves from an Internet jury are in the clear, allowing people who recycle the information to get rich for a formalized version of blackmail. I doubt these websites can claim they perform a duty to society when they’re allowing certain people to get off the hook and erase their own records.
Several state governments have tried to pass laws 
on mugshot postings, like a Georgia law that allows people to ask for their picture to be taken down if they can prove the charges have been dismissed. That and other laws have seemed to be ineffective, since content on the Internet is easily distributed to other pages. It’s a constant chase for absolution, even for people who have had their legal record expunged in court.
This debate is a balance between privacy and free 
speech. In this case, the First Amendment should pre-vail. Government shouldn’t restrict what the websites publish. However, I believe payment companies like MasterCard and PayPal are doing the right thing by cut-ting their ties with these types of businesses due to the nature of the negotiation. 
Public records are a forte in our democratic society, 
but websites that leverage privacy with money are a maﬁ  a structure that should be taken down.

Baby boomers often call millennials lazy, entitled and 
narcissistic. If you believe them, then you’d think the country is going to hell in a handbasket when we’re 
in charge. But have boomers looked into a mirror lately?
The so-called leaders of our 
nation are, for the most part, from the baby-boomer genera-tion — born between 1946 and 1964 — and a far too many of them completely suck. 
To be fair, most boomers 
aren’t terrible people. My par-ents are great, and I bet yours are too. So are many of our pro-fessors, family members, friends and colleagues who are members of the boomer club. 
This dejected view of our elders is directed almost sole-
ly at the leaders who emerged from that generation. 
Our politics have grown increasingly bitter, divided 
and nasty over recent years and we have no one else to thank than the boomers who entered public service. Sure, partisan rancor isn’t isolated to our current crop of leaders, but no one today appears willing to end the squabbling. 
Public service requires compassion, understanding, 
compromise and a realization that in order to accomplish anything, you must be willing to work together. 
Leaders today exude few, if any, of these qualities and 
our country is suffering as a result. 
Don’t believe me? Flip through the headlines — or, more 
likely, Twitter. You’re inundated with news, opinions and musings about the recent shutdown of the government, the threat of a default on our nation’s debt and the inability to accomplish anything of substance in Congress. 
In order for our representative democracy to function, 
leaders are elected to work together, form a consensus and accomplish something that betters our society. True, it’s mostly Republican leaders conducting this nonsense — who seem determined to deny President Barack Obama any accomplishments during his presidency — but politi-cians in general are guilty of this dysfunctional behavior. 
Both parties act as if they are absolutely right and the 
other side is dead wrong. When all fail to see eye-to-eye on any issue, it’s both sides that have a problem. 
When I was a child, I was taught the values of shar-
ing, understanding, empathy and compromise. Surely our leaders were taught the same in their younger days. If not, perhaps it’s time for a refresher. 
Parents instill in their children that life isn’t always 
fair, and you’re not always going to get what you want. The public ofﬁ  ce elected ofﬁ  cials hold doesn’t give them permission to fold their arms, throw a tantrum and insist on their position. No matter how hard they try, governing and life simply don’t work that way. 
To illustrious leaders unwilling to budge on any issue: 
Did your parents always buy you a toy when you demand-ed it? I know mine didn’t, and I’m a better person for it. 
Perhaps it’s time to reconsider your ludicrous positions 
and take action on our nation’s mounting problems before it’s too late. 
As we drown in mountains of student loan debt and 
struggle to ﬁ  nd well-paying jobs in a stagnant economy, we are belittled and criticized by the boomers. They call us lazy and entitled, yet they have the fortitude to run our nation’s capital like some two-bit circus, hell-bent on burn-ing down the tent with us inside. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. 
Political ideology and principle replaced rationality 
long ago, and now the poison has reached the highest lev-els of government. No longer can our leaders ﬁ  nd common ground on even the simplest issues. 
Maybe this is their ultimate lesson to the young people 
of our great country because if we don’t grow from the mistakes of our current leaders, this great experiment in democracy is doomed to die an early death.
The economy has yet to recover from the Great Reces-
sion, and our elected ofﬁ  cials continue to operate from one manufactured crisis to the next. Today it’s a shutdown of the government, and the future appears very bleak. Amer-icans work together to accomplish great things, and it’s high time for our leaders to do the same.

Every Fall we take our annual pilgrimage 
to Jacksonville to witness the “War for the Oar,” also known as Florida-Geor-
gia. Each year, Gators get to experience and enjoy the city of Jacksonville but are usually confronted with difﬁ  culty getting around one of the nation’s largest cities by land area.
One of the main planks in my platform as student body 
president is to increase safety for students. After several years of partaking in the Florida-Georgia tradition, I have noticed that safe and reliable transportation is a major issue for students. Jacksonville’s current taxi system be-comes easily overwhelmed, which often leaves students wandering through downtown Jacksonville, searching for a way home from EverBank Field or The Jacksonville Landing. Worse, a lack of alternative transportation op-tions could lead to an increase in intoxicated drivers on the roads.
These Jacksonville transportation options could be 
dramatically improved as soon as next week, as the city council debates allowing the entrance of new ride tech-nologies like Uber to Jacksonville. 
Some of you may be familiar with Uber, which is a 
smartphone app that links riders to on-demand private rides, usually in classy black sedans or SUVs. I have personally traveled to several cities that feature Uber and can vouch for the ease of use, reliability and safety improvements over traditional transportation options. With Uber, the cars go to the riders, not the riders 
to the cars. No more roaming around downtown Jackson-ville desperate for an open taxi.
Uber trips are backed by GPS to ensure fair billing, are 
linked to your credit card and allow passengers to split fares evenly among themselves. Want to let your friends know what time you’re going to arrive at the game? Use the Uber “Share Your ETA” option so they know exactly how long they will have to wait.
If the Jacksonville City Council is able to pass Ordi-
nance 554 promptly, Uber’s services and others like them could potentially be available for public use in time for this year’s game. If you would like to see Uber and other rider apps available in Jacksonville for Florida-Georgia, I encourage you to email City Council President Bill Gul-liford at Gulliford@coj.net.
Hope to see you soon in Jacksonville rolling around in 
safe and classy rides. Go Gators!

UF needs to follow suit and 
implement DACA
As a UF student, I remained puz-
zled as to why, after more than a year 
of Deferred Action for Childhood Ar-rivals being in existence, the univer-sity has not acted on implementing it at the university.
Florida International University 
took the lead this past June when its Board of Trustees decided to imple-ment partial tuition waivers for un-documented students who met the requirements of DACA. 
UF, as the ﬂ  agship university, 
should validate that title by following suit and not simply waiting for our state House and Senate to take the lead, since they have shown in pre-vious years that in matters concern-ing education they aren’t progressive with constant cuts to the university being leveled by the Florida Congress in the past decade.
I want to be at a university that 
is as inclusive as possible and wel-comes the most marginalized of our state. Young people who came to this country at no fault of their own shouldn’t be prevented from achiev-ing a quality education and actualiz-ing their potential. Immigrants both documented and undocumented make huge unquantiﬁ  able contribu-tions to our society and deserve to have access to in-state tuition.
By not allowing this opportunity 
provided through DACA, the univer-sity is closing its doors to some of the best and brightest minds in the state.Students of UF: If you believe in 
equality and justice and want tuition equity for students, plug yourself into UF Students for a Democratic Society’s ongoing campaign to get the Board of Trustees to implement DACA at UF and allow qualiﬁ  ed un-documented students to pay in-state tuition.
Enact the change you wish to see 
with struggle!

There may be more incentive than just fresh 
breath to keep teeth clean after a recent study 
showed that dental bacteria may lead to brain degeneration.
Dr. Lakshmyya Kesavalu, an associate pro-
fessor in the College of Dentistry department of periodontology, worked with researchers from the University of Central Lancashire and The Blizard Institute in the United Kingdom on the project.
Together, they found oral bacteria was present in four out of 10 Alzheimer’s disease brain samples, while none were found in the brains of those without Alzheimer’s disease, Kesavalu said. He has been working on the project for three years and said the human mouth contains more than 700 different types of bacteria.
“If you want to prevent bacteria from go-
ing into the blood and brain, cut down on sug-ary foods and smoke,” he said.  
There are three known types of Alzheimer’s 
disease: early-onset, late-onset and familial Al-zheimer’s disease, which involves genetics. 
However, the bacteria mostly affects those who have late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, Ke-savalu said.
Dr. Timothy Millward, a dentist at Univer-
sity Family Dentistry, said he was unaware of the research that had been done, but that it makes sense there is a correlation.“Oral bacteria are actually quite common,” 
he said. “The mouth is basically a petri dish. It’s got a lot of bacteria that are present in it all the time.”
Millward said the most common ways 
of getting bacteria are through gum disease, which can be prevented by flossing and brush-ing, and from family history. Some patients can keep the utmost care of their teeth but still are unable to avoid bacteria because of genetic history. 
“(Bacteria) are also doing a lot of collateral 
damage,” he said. “That collateral damage can affect the brain, other arteries and organs.”
Gingivitis may be linked to Alzheimer’s, according to study 
“If you want to prevent bacteria 
from going into the blood and brain, 
cut down on sugary foods and 
smoke.”

During October, breast can-
cer awareness supporters have 
the option to choose food in the statement-making pink shade at Tijuana Flats.  
“For a one dollar donation, 
guests can choose to have a pink tortilla for their hard or soft taco entrée,” according to a Tijuana Flats press release. “One hundred percent of the donations through the ‘Make it Pink’ option will benefit (the Breast Cancer Research Foun-dation).”
Also available for no extra 
cost are pink ribbon-shaped tortilla chips. This is the seventh year the Just in Queso Founda-tion, Tijuana Flats’ charity, has raised money for the founda-tion.
Jordan Castillow, a 19-year-
old UF music education sopho-more, said he chose to “make it pink,” as the corporation calls it, because of the novelty.
“And it supports breast can-
cer awareness,” Castillow said. “It seems like a pretty creative way to raise money for re-search.” 
In fact, the rosy Tex-Mex 
creations still tasted pretty nor-mal, too, he said.  
“I guess in my mind I want 
it to taste different because it’s the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen,” Castillow said.

� UF DOESN’T HAVE 
PROGRAMS IN PLACE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. 
LAUREN ADHAV
Alligator Contributing Writer
More than 20 percent of 
undergraduates in 2008 had at 
least one child — but less than 10 percent completed their bachelor’s degrees within six years, according to a Wisconsin Financial Aid study recently in the news.
Some universities don’t 
provide the proper health services and accommodations to pregnant students, according to the study.
UF doesn’t have programs in 
place to cater to pregnant students, despite having pregnant women come in for counseling, said Roberta Seldman, a psychologist at UF’s Counseling & Wellness Center.“ T h e r e ’ s 
certainly no reason that women can’t continue their schooling while pregnant if they have the proper support system,” said 
Phylis Craig, a nurse practitioner at the Women’s Clinic in the UF Student Healthcare Center.
Most pregnant students come in for early evaluations or the treatment of simple illnesses, such as urinary tract infections, she said.
“We do not see many pregnant 
students on an ongoing basis,” Craig said. “Maybe five to 10 (women) a month come in for diagnosis and simple acute illnesses, not for an ongoing problem.”
She said although UF has a lot 
of medical resources available for women, she imagined being pregnant would pose more problems at a smaller school.
The Women’s Clinic offers 
preconception counseling, which helps prepare women who are anticipating pregnancy — usually mostly graduate students.
“I think it’s important that 
pregnancy is planned,” Craig said. “And we have many ways that students can prevent unintended pregnancy and have it planned. That’s the ideal way of doing it.”

The Florida soccer team 
won 3-0 against Auburn on Sunday but lost Pamela Begic. Read the story on page 16.  
Gators move up in polls
The Florida football team moved up one spot to No. 17 in 
the Associated Press Poll released Sunday. UF jumped two spots to No. 17 in the USA Today Coaches’ Poll.JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
Don’t be careless with the foot-
ball when Loucheiz Purifoy is 
coming after you. 
Purifoy targets “violators.” Ar-
kansas quarterback Brandon Allen was simply the latest. 
The Pensacola native forced 
two critical turnovers — including his ﬁ  rst career interception — in Florida’s 30-10 victory on Saturday night in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
“It’s a big game, just have to 
make big plays,” Purifoy said. “That’s how they look at it. They always say big players come out when the lights come on.”
The Gators’ victory against the 
Razorbacks was a return to form for Purifoy, who has struggled with both consistency and in-jury this season. Before Saturday, his blocked punt against Miami on Sept. 7 was one of few high-lights for the junior through three games.
“I just take it one game at a 
time,” Purifoy said of his unre-markable start to the season. “I knew sooner or later, the teams we are playing, they’re going to start coming my way, so just got to make plays.”
Purifoy’s loss in the box score 
has been Vernon Hargreaves III’s gain. 
The freshman has recorded 
three interceptions through Flor-ida’s ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games. Hargreaves proved his worth, so the opposi-tion is now forced to pick its poi-son — Hargreaves or Purifoy.
“We seem to all say he’s not 
playing good,” coach Will Mus-champ said. “He hasn’t had a lot of balls thrown his way this year. A little bit of that is how many op-portunities you’ve had.”
Defensive back Cody Riggs 
added: “People don’t throw at him because they don’t want the ball to get intercepted. You see what happened when they threw at him.”
Purifoy didn’t wait for Arkan-
sas to throw the ball at him to make a play on Saturday. 
Will Muschamp 
lingered in the South End Zone 
meeting room as Solomon Patton strolled in just min-utes removed from a stel-lar night in The Swamp.
After Patton’s 124-yard, 
two-touchdown perfor-mance, Muschamp quipped, “Stand up, Solomon. We can’t see you.” 
Media members and team person-
nel cackled. Muschamp then gave the ﬂ  oor to his senior wide receiver. Pat-ton barely had a chance to sit down before recorders, notebooks and cam-eras swarmed the self-proclaimed fastest man on the team. With yet an-other dynamic performance, Patton is becoming a popular player these days.It’s time he gets the 
ball more. Redshirt junior Quinton Dunbar repre-sents Florida’s most com-plete receiver. Freshman Demarcus Robinson might have the most raw talent. But Patton makes the most plays.
Here’s how Florida can take better 
advantage of its playmaking receiver, who is knocked for being three inch-es too short and 20 pounds too light: Put Patton in the slot, where he can work against a linebacker and a No. 3 cornerback. Senior slot receiver Trey Burton, who is productive as well, can take on a receiving tight end, H-back role.

Jon Harrison was ejected against Arkansas 
on Saturday night, but the reason remains un-
clear.
With the Gators leading the Razorbacks 
24-7 during the third quarter, Florida’s center was involved in an altercation with a referee. To what extent Harrison made contact with the ofﬁ  cial is uncertain, but he was ﬂ  agged for unsportsmanlike conduct and disqualiﬁ  ed from the game. 
“Jon’s an emotional guy; he lost his temper 
and did something he shouldn’t have done,” coach Will Muschamp said. “He was ejected from the game, and rightfully so. We’ll handle it and move forward.”
Asked if Harrison made contact with the 
ofﬁ  cial, Muschamp replied: “I’m not going to get into all that. He just did something he shouldn’t have done.”
Harrison’s outburst is rare for the Gators, 
who have spoken about limiting personal foul penalties this season.
Loucheiz Purifoy, who claimed an Ar-
kansas player spit on him while ﬁ  ghting for a muffed punt during the second quarter, said Florida players have added incentive for keeping their noses clean on the ﬁ  eld.
“You seen our coach?” Purifoy quipped. The Southeastern Conference has not an-
nounced any further punishment for Harri-son.
Kicking woes: Florida 
lost its top receiver, rusher and seven of its starters on defense from last season, but replacing kicker Caleb Sturgis has proven to be the most burdensome through ﬁ  ve games.
Redshirt freshman Aus-
tin Hardin and senior Brad Phillips competed for the job during training camp. Hardin won the spot but has done nothing to keep it.
Despite missing 3 of his 7 ﬁ  eld goal at-
tempts during the ﬁ  rst month of the season, Hardin kept the job leading into a matchup with Arkansas. But his fourth miss — a 48-yard attempt that was blocked after barely getting off the ground — cost him his job.
“Obviously, the blocked kick wasn’t what 
we want,” Muschamp said. “Austin just Center ejected in fourth quarter Junior cornerback sparks Gators with ﬁ  rst interception

Florida defense limited Arkansas to 111 rushing yards in win
The Gators limited the Razorbacks 
to their second lowest rushing out-put of the season; Saturday was the worst running performance by UF in 2013.
Coming into the game, Arkan-
sas freshman Alex Collins had run for 100 or more yards in four of his ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games. He looked poised to do it again following a produc-tive ﬁ  rst half.
The freshman tailback racked up 
51 yards on six carries as Florida’s defense had trouble plugging the holes Collins ran through.
However, the Gators bottled up 
Collins for the rest of the game. He ﬁ  nished with 54 yards on 13 carries — an average of 0.6 yards per run during the second half.
“The gap control wasn’t very 
good there in the ﬁ  rst half,” Mus-champ said. “We came back in the second half and played the runs better.”
While Florida’s defense stymied 
Arkansas on the ground, the Ra-zorbacks halted any attempts by the Gators to dominate the running game.
Sophomore Matt Jones strug-
gled to establish his presence. He ﬁ  nished the game with 50 yards on 17 attempts for a meager 2.9 yards per carry.His backup, Mack Brown, also 
had trouble. The Razorbacks held the redshirt junior, who ran for 112 yards in Jones’ absence in the sea-son opener, to 39 yards on 11 car-ries.
But while Florida struggled on 
the ground, it made up the differ-ence through the air while halting any potential Arkansas aerial as-sault.
The Gators’ pass defense 
bumped and hurried Razorbacks quarterback Brandon Allen, who completed only 17 of his 41 passes.
After Allen completed a 31-yard 
pass that led to a touchdown in the ﬁ  rst quarter, Florida buckled down for the rest of the game. 
Purifoy made Allen pay on the 
next drive, returning an errant pass for a 42-yard touchdown to give UF a lead it never relinquished.
“I’ve seen that play a lot,” Mus-
champ said. “I haven’t seen him ﬁ  nish that play.”
Murphy eliminated any chance 
of an Arkansas comeback with 4:47 remaining in the fourth quarter. 
He dumped off a shovel pass 
to running back Valdez Showers, who  returned from an ankle injury that kept him out for two games, and Showers scampered into the end zone to give Florida a 20-point lead.
Phillips missed the extra point, 
but the damage was done. The Gators’ defense contained the Ra-zorbacks, stopping their ﬁ  nal drive at the 3-yard line before Murphy kneeled to end the game.
“As long as we get wins, I’m 
happy,” Murphy said. “[Things have] been clicking in the game for us, so we just need to keep doing what we’re doing.”

Mary Wise put an exclamation mark on 
her career Friday night by notching her 700th 
victory as Florida’s coach by beating Texas A&M.
On Sunday, she collected win No. 701. No. 3 Florida swept Alabama in Tuscaloosa, 
Ala., for the Gators’ seventh straight sweep.
“It’s possible people will look at this and 
expect Florida to win 3-0 against this young Alabama team,” Wise said. “But I got to tell you: Winning 3-0 in Tuscaloosa is quite the ac-complishment for our program.”
The victory not only continued Florida’s 
(15-1, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) winning streak in the SEC, but it maintained the Gators’ impressive unbeaten set streak.
Florida has not lost a set since a 30–28 third-
set loss to Western Michigan on Sept. 14 for a run of 22 straight. UF has not lost a match since Sept. 8 against then-No. 1 Penn State. 
The Gators’ senior combination of middle 
blocker Chloe Mann and setter Taylor Brau-neis led the way in Tusca-
loosa.  
Mann, who set Florida’s 
career hitting-percentage record earlier this season, hit .737 during the match to go along with her team-leading 14 kills. 
“Chloe was nothing 
short of outstanding,” Wise said.  
“It’s just Chloe. ... Not all sets are in her 
wheelhouse, but she has the ability to do now what she couldn’t do in the beginning of her career.
“She had a few that were a little bit lower 
and she got on top of it and got some off speed shots, which were happening. She just has so much court to work with, credit to Taylor.”
 Although Florida did not have a high 
amount of blocks in the game, it kept the game in control by registering 32 digs.. 
The hitting percentage was the key contrast 
in the match.  Florida hit .529 while holding Alabama (13-4, 1-2 SEC) to just .155. Gators sweep Crimson Tide to complete historic weekend

Several Gators celebrate with fans following Florida’s 30-10 victory against Arkansas on Saturday. UF has now won 10 consecutive home games and limited its last 12 conference opponents to 20 points or fewer dating back to Nov. 12, 2011.backfield for reverses, end-arounds and sweeps, 
but a move inside would change this offense. Bur-ton would continue catching first downs and Patton would get the ball more in space. A young receiver like Robinson could develop opposite Dunbar.
Through five games, Patton’s 348 yards and 
four touchdowns lead the Gators. Other than Pat-ton, only Burton has a touchdown from the receiver position. Each score from Patton has been for 20 or more yards.
He creates havoc in any defense with the slight-
est tackling deficiency. Both touchdowns against Arkansas came on hitch routes.
“Because of the run game, we’ve created a lot of 
one-on-ones, and he’s a slippery guy,” Muschamp said. “One missed tackle and it could be the dis-tance. When you have guys like that that are able to make those sorts of plays, it changes your thought process as a defensive coordinator. Playing all that bump-and-run, man-to-man is great until you miss a tackle. There’s nobody left.”
Arkansas cornerback Tevin Mitchel missed 
initial tackles on both touchdowns by Patton. The junior whiffed badly on Patton’s 38-yard and 51-yard touchdowns. Patton looked three steps faster than the Razorbacks. In a game in which the Gators’ running backs averaged 3 yards a carry, his speed made the difference.Patton had eight touches Saturday night. He 
averages 15 yards a play either on the ground or through the air. 
It’s when he’s one-on-one that catches his eye.“I get excited because, you know, with my speed 
going against some of these DBs, we watch film on them. We know what they can do and what they can’t do,” Patton said. “We just try to take advan-tage of them one-on-one.”
Patton’s evolution from special teamer to offen-
sive gimmick to bona fide receiving threat has been impressive. More surprising is that it all happened at the same school.
He thought about transferring. He spurned Ala-
bama for Florida out of high school in 2010 only to have one reception in 10 games his freshman year. Patton had just eight catches for 79 yards in three seasons. Three blocked kicks remained his biggest contribution until lighting up Miami for six catches and 118 yards on Sept. 7.
After juking three Arkansas defenders for his 38-
yard touchdown in the third quarter, Patton blew a kiss to the students in the North end zone — a fitting tribute to a career that’s finally reaping its re-wards. Patton, always humble, was appreciative of his hot start.
It’s clear Patton has become the go-to playmak-
er. Muschamp had it wrong about him Saturday night. 
We see him fine. Just not how we should.kicked it too low. It had nothing 
to do with penetration. I could’ve blocked it. We’ve got to improve there.”
Phillips came on when a Flor-
ida drive stalled in Arkansas ter-ritory during the second quarter. The senior connected on a 28-yard try to cut the Gators’ deficit to 7-3 and seemingly surpass Hardin on the depth chart.
Unfortunately for Florida, its 
kicking woes continued. 
Phillips missed an extra point 
following a 9-yard receiving touchdown by Valdez Showers late in the fourth quarter.
It remains unclear whether 
Hardin or Phillips will attempt Florida’s next field goal.
“It’s open,” Muschamp said 
when asked how the depth chart looks at the position.
Punter Kyle Christy, who had 
his job threatened by Muschamp earlier this season, shanked a 15-yard punt against Arkansas. His hold on the starting punter job could also be in jeopardy.
Injuries: Marcus Roberson 
missed his third consecutive game with an injured knee. Val-dez Showers (ankle) returned after missing two games and scored a touchdown during the fourth quarter.
Jarrad Davis suffered a cheek 
laceration and left the game. Muschamp expects Roberson and Davis to return next week against LSU. 
Senior breaking through: Sol-
omon Patton won’t slow down.
An afterthought through three 
seasons, the senior continues to emerge as a dynamic offensive threat for the Gators. His latest career performance helped pro-pel No. 18 Florida to a 30-10 vic-tory against Arkansas in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
“We told him, ‘We need you to 
be a guy that can help us in the game and be a refined route run-ner,’ and that’s something he has done,” Muschamp said. “You’ve got to credit the young man and his work ethic. He’s having a spe-cial year.”
Patton continues to develop 
into one of quarterback Tyler Murphy’s favorite targets. He finished Saturday night with six catches for a career-high 124 yards and two touchdowns.
The first touchdown strike 
came during Florida’s last drive of the first half. Nursing a 10-7 lead, the Gators appeared to be willing to enter halftime.
However, after Mack Brown 
gained five yards on second and 17, Murphy hit Patton on a simple curl route. The speedy re-ceiver turned up field and raced 51 yards to extend Florida’s lead to 17-7.
“He’s a slippery guy,” Mus-
champ said. 
“One missed tackle and it 
could be the distance.”
Patton struck again during Florida’s first drive after halftime, exhibiting his 4.36 speed to take a pass over the middle for 38 yards and his second touchdown.
“It was a great feeling to be 
able to perform like that in front of all of those fans,” Patton said. “Offense, we weren’t doing too much, and then I finally had that explosive play, and I helped out my team.”
Two starts and one relief ap-
pearance into his UF career, Mur-phy is glad to be throwing to Pat-ton.
Patton has a team-leading 348 receiving yards and four touch-downs on 19 catches this season.
“I’m happy he’s on our team 
and not the other team,” Murphy said. 
“He’s very smart. He’s so quick 
and hard to tackle. He just knows how to find the open spot.”

AdAm , from page 12Patton developing into Gators’ top 
receiving target during 2013 season Cornerback forced fumble
Everyone watching the Gators 
and the Razorbacks saw Purifoy in-
vade the backfield. Well, everyone except Allen. Blitzing from the blind side without a blocker in sight, Pu-rifoy sacked Allen from behind,  knocking the football loose for his first forced fumble since Florida’s 37-26 win against Florida State last November in Tallahassee.
“When I 
seen he still had the ball in his hand, my eyes got 
big,” Purifoy said. “I knew if I got to him with the ball in his hands I’m going to get it out. It’s just what we talk about: Get the ball out.”
One quarter later, the ball-hawk-
ing junior finally forced a new kind of turnover. Shortly after Florida cut the Arkansas lead to four, Pu-rifoy picked off Allen and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown, giving Florida the lead for good.
“I’ve seen that play a lot. I haven’t 
seen him finish that play. I’ve seen him be in that position,” Muschamp said. “To finish on that play, to cre-ate some momentum, to get that crowd going — the top came off the place when it happened.”Senior defensive back Jaylen 
Watkins added: “The interception definitely was what we needed at the time.”
Purifoy earned some of the loud-
est cheers in The Swamp last sea-son. One game-changing play after another put the playmaker on the map.
In a cornerback blitz similar to 
his strip and sack of Allen on Satur-day, Purifoy set the tone in Florida’s 44-11 win against South Carolina by doing the exact same thing to Gamecocks quarterback Connor Shaw on the game’s first play from scrimmage.
Three weeks later, he blocked a 
punt against Louisiana that former Gator Jelani Jenkins caught and ran into the end zone for the game-win-ning touchdown in a 27-20 victory.
With Marcus Roberson still 
nursing a sprained left knee that has sidelined him for three straight games and Hargreaves still coming into his own, UF needs Purifoy to perform.
On Saturday, the junior deliv-
ered. Moving forward, the Gators expect even more.
“He knew he had to fill a void,” 
Watkins said. “He knew the last few weeks that he needed to step up. He did that today. He definitely came to play today.”

Pamela Begic took a hard fall while looking 
to capitalize on a set piece for Florida and re-
cover from a loss to South Carolina on Friday night. 
The Slovenian freshman turned a mix-up 
into magic, sacriﬁ  cing herself in the process en route to a 3-0 shutout against Auburn at James G. Pressly Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
Christen Westphal took Florida’s ﬁ  rst cor-
ner kick in the 16th minute. 
Westphal crossed the 
ball to the right of the box and freshman forward Savannah Jordan sent it 
into the left corner.
A Tigers (4-8-1, 0-5 Southeastern Confer-
ence) defender headed it out but directed it right to Begic, who dove forward to head the ball into the right corner of the goal. While doing so, she collided into Tigers goalkeeper Alicen Wright.
Florida (9-3-1, 3-2 SEC) grabbed its ﬁ  rst 
goal and the lead, but Begic left the game with an unspeciﬁ  ed injury and did not return. 
Coach Becky Burleigh expects Begic to be 
ﬁ  ne.
“That was a really brave goal,” Burleigh 
said. “That took a lot of courage because she knew she was going to get hammered on that goal.”
Burleigh substituted in ﬁ  ve players during 
a 15-minute span after the ﬁ  rst goal. 
Midﬁ  elder Liz Slattery and forward Jillian 
Graff were two players who made an impact.
The two pressured Auburn’s back line, and 
in the 30th minute, Slattery made her way up the ﬁ  eld,  bypassing a defender to ﬁ  nd Graff, who used the open space to sink a 15-yard shot into the left corner for her second goal of the season.
“I put a spin on it so she could just touch 
it,” Slattery said. “She had a great touch to ﬁ  n-ish it.”
 Slattery’s assist was her ﬁ  rst for UF.“Every time you go in off the bench, it’s an 
opportunity to show the coaches you can play and you can be on the starting lineup,” Slat-tery said. 
“Every single game, I’m working harder 
and harder to get into that lineup and get into that rotation. Once you get on the ﬁ  eld, you got to take advantage of it, work your hardest, you got to do things right and try to make as least mistakes as possible.”
The Gators continued that mentality, look-
ing for a third goal to cushion their lead before halftime.
Burleigh subbed senior midﬁ  elder Caroline 
Triglia in after the second goal. The change proved beneﬁ  cial when Triglia scored the Gators’ ﬁ  nal goal in the 40th minute.
“Setting the tone early in the ﬁ  rst half was good for us,” Burleigh said. “If we can get ahead and keep it, I think it’s a very difﬁ  cult team to break down.”
