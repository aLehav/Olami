� IT CLARIFIED ADMISSION AND 
ADDED STUDENT ADVISERS.

A year after its launch, UF’s Innovation 
Academy has made significant changes to its program and plans to continue developing.
One of the prominent changes is a new ap-
plication procedure that requires an addition-
al essay and makes it clearer that students are 
applying to the program. 
Previously, applying to Innovation Acade-
my meant simply checking a box indicating in-terest in the program. If students who checked the box were admitted to UF, they were auto-matically placed in Innovation Academy.
Students like David Nassau didn’t find out 
about the program’s Spring-Summer schedule 
and required innovation minor until after they 
were accepted.
“That’s been the main complaint,” the 
19-year-old UF Innovation Academy sopho-more said. “People didn’t know what they were getting themselves into.”Students applying for the 2014-2015 school 
year were given the option of applying to UF traditional programs, Innovation Academy or 
both. If students gain admittance to both pro-
grams, they will be able to choose which offer to accept.
Although changing the application pro-
cess meant that Innovation Academy received UF Innovation Academy program undergoes changes

Amy O’Connell couldn’t believe what happened.
When O’Connell saw on Facebook that pop sensa-
tion Justin Drew Bieber was arrested Thursday in Mi-ami Beach, she wasn’t convinced. But when she saw the reports that he faced charges of DUI, resisting arrest 
without violence and driving with an expired license 
proved to be true, the three-year Belieber’s skepticism grew into disappointment. 
“Yeah, I have a Bieber problem,” 
the 22-year-old UF graduate student said. “It’s embarrassing being in col-lege, but I am not ashamed.” 
Days after the arrest, local fans 
and haters are still processing the 
news and speculating as to how the 
star fell so far. 
Scott Wilson, UF assistant profes-
sor of jazz, said he thinks young art-
ists like Bieber tend to crack under pressure.
“They can’t harness all that anxiety of performing 
for 80,000 people,” he said. “It would crush a normal person.”
Wilson said Bieber’s recent activities are “signs he’s Never say never:

The first day of qualifying and 
slating for Student Government 
brought a crowd of about 60 stu-dents to the Hub study room Fri-day.
Last year, nearly 80 students qualified on the first day of slat-ing, according to Alligator ar-chives.
Candidates must qualify to be 
able to run for a Student Senate seat. 
Parties can interview, or slate, 
the candidates who want to run with their party.
Susan Webster, the spokes-
woman for the Swamp Party, said 49 people qualified and slated on Friday.
“All in all, it’s been super suc-
cessful,” she said. “We’re really excited to have a lot more people come out and slate Monday and Tuesday.”
Webster said when students sign up to slate, they must have their Gator 1 Cards and check their credits to see what seat they qualify for.
Alex Klayman, the spokesman 
for the Students Party, said they had about eight people qualify and interview with their party on Friday.
“That’s about the number we 
expected,” he said. “The first day is usually slow.”
Slating will continue in the 
HUB study room Monday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Elections are Feb. 18 and 19.

MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3
Jan. 27, 1988 
A new ﬁ  nancial aid law 
made it impossible for about 
300 UF students to receive ﬁ  -
nancial aid, according to Al-ligator archives. UF ofﬁ  cials announced that students 
with a grade point average 
lower than a 2.0 would lose their aid, but they could ap-peal to a committee if they could prove their low GPAs 
were caused by “extenuating 
circumstances.” UF Registrar Vernon Voyles said 22,000 of UF’s 32,000 students re-
ceived ﬁ  nancial aid. The law 
required students to have a GPA greater than  2.0 after their sophomore year, which for UF is more than 60 credit 
hours. However, students 
could get their aid back the following semester if they could raise their GPAs.   
Jan. 26, 2001 Gainesville residents took 
their vehicle-towing stories to city ofﬁ  cials to shed light 
on what they believed was 
unethical business behav-ior. One Gainesville resident told a committee his car had 
been towed from his home 
at Park Place Apartments by Watsons Towing for “failure to display a proper decal.”  He then explained the situa-
tion to the owner and got his 
truck and money back. How-ever, the same tow truck driver towed his car from the 
same spot a few days later. 
City Commissioner Chuck Chestnut said there should be stringent rules for tow companies to follow, and 
they “should accept some 
sort of responsibility for their actions.” 
Jan. 27, 2009 The Florida Legislature 
passed a budget package in both the House and Senate that increased ﬁ  nes and fees 
for trafﬁ  c or trafﬁ  c-related 
violations. The measure add-ed $25 to speeding ﬁ  nes and an extra $10 to all moving 
and nonmoving violations, 
which included seatbelt charges and driving with an expired license. The initia-tive was designed to relieve 
a $2.4 billion Florida budget 
deﬁ  cit, and it was projected to generate about $63 million in 2010. The fees increased 
speeding ﬁ  nes from $125 to 
$150 for drivers speeding between 15 and 19 mph over the speed limit. 
— STEVEN KATONAnot happy with his direction,” adding 
that the star has never won a Grammy.
“We’ll have to see what happens to 
him: how he changes, if he changes and if he just spirals down,” Wilson said.
On the night of his arrest, a Miami 
Beach Police ofﬁ  cer pulled Bieber over at about 4 a.m. for racing a Lamborghi-ni, according to the arrest report. The ofﬁ  cer noticed his bloodshot eyes and the smell of alcohol on his breath.
“Why the f*** are you doing this?” 
Bieber asked police before they arrest-ed him. He was released from jail later 
that day after meeting a $2,500 bond.
Tom Llinas, co-owner of Great 
Southern Music, is not a Belieber. But he isn’t a stranger to young artists. His 
teen daughter and son are both musi-cians, and he said about 500 students come into his shop every week for mu-sic lessons.
“I would say it’s kind of sad,” he 
said of the arrest. “The people around him are kind of letting him down.”
If Bieber were his son, Llinas said he 
would have a simple message for him: “Remember who you are. Remember where you came from. Remember that your family loves you more than any-thing.” 
O’Connell also said family can help 
Bieber bounce back. 
“We can always hope for the best, 
I suppose,” she said. “I’m hoping his mom will knock some sense into him.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 2014

Connor Honeycutt was shopping at a 
garage sale with his father when he spot-
ted a Star Wars action ﬁ  gure that had something missing.
“I thought it was weird that (an X-Wing 
Fighter) didn’t have Luke, so I looked for him,” Honeycutt, 14, said.
Honeycutt said he has been collecting 
Star Wars action ﬁ  gures for about seven years. He said his collection now has doz-ens of the action ﬁ  gures. 
It was one of about 100 that were dis-
played at the Florida Museum of Natural History’s annual collectors fair Saturday.
Beginning in 1980, the fair is one of the 
museum’s longest-running and most pop-ular events, said Tiffany Ireland, museum educator and coordinator of the fair. 
“This is an event that is interesting to — 
I honestly think — everybody,” she said. 
The longevity and popularity of the fair 
has led local collectors to attend year after year, she said. 
J.J. Lewis, a 37-year-old Gainesville resi-
dent, has been displaying her spatula col-lection at the fair for 20 years.
She said she started her collection after 
she received a spatula as a gag gift from a friend. Although Lewis said she lost count at 1,300, she said she thinks she now has close to 2,000 spatulas. 
“Once you start collecting, you can’t 
stop,” she said. 
Although this year’s fair hosted many 
veterans, there were some newcomers with their unique collections.
Belle Starenchak, a 37-year-old Citrus 
Springs resident, displayed her collec-tion of Pikachu-themed items. She said it started 14 years ago after she won a giant stuffed Pikachu at Universal Studios. One 
Pikachu turned into thousands, she said.
Starenchak’s collection was a Guinness 
World Record in 2009 and 2010. She said 
she attends birthday parties in a Pikachu-themed costume, goes to conventions and has been featured on TV. 
“I just don’t collect,” Starenchak said. “I 
actually go out and live Pokemon.”
Even though Starenchak has made a ca-
reer out of her collection, many participants in the fair said they collect as a hobby.
One hobbyist is Gainesville resident, 
Nelson Laffey, president of the Gainesville Stamp Club, who displayed the postal stamp collection he said he inherited the collection from his father 10 years ago.  He said the collection has now has grown to more than 20,000.
“I couldn’t choose a favorite,” Laffey 
said. “It’s like children.”Pikachu, spatula collections among displays at museum fair

More online courses offered
fewer applicants this year, director Jeff Citty 
said he thinks the change will increase the program’s quality. 
This semester, the curriculum has also 
expanded to include majors such as com-
puter science, engineering and digital arts 
and sciences.
Citty said his staff doesn’t choose the 
program’s majors. Rather, colleges offer to participate if there is enough staff to run courses on the Spring-Summer model. 
With more majors available, students 
have more classes to choose from during 
the Fall semester. Although they are not al-
lowed to take classes on campus in the Fall, students starting next year will be able to choose up to 12 credits from a selection of about 160 online classes — up from the 40 offered last semester. 
However, for some students, the pro-gram’s format has been difﬁ  cult.
Justin Nelson, a 19-year-old UF freshman 
in the program, said it seems like a waste of time. 
“If we’re part of the Innovation Acade-
my,” he said, “we should feel like we’re part of something bigger.”
To help students adjust, staff moved into 
a new ofﬁ  ce on the third ﬂ  oor of the Inﬁ  rma-ry at the beginning of the month. Students now have their own academic adviser and a team of student ambassadors that they can go to for support.
Danna Regnier, a student ambassador 
and a 21-year-old UF ﬁ  nance and informa-tion systems sophomore, said the program will thrive once it has time to mature. 
“While there are struggles, there are les-
sons,” she said. “We learn to grow as UF students in a rough way, but it gives us more of an edge in competition in the days to come.”INNOVATION , from page 1

Swamp Records hosted a 
showcase Friday night to high-
light local Gainesville musical tal-ent and to build excitement about 
the student-run record label. The showcase was presented 
by Student Government Produc-
tions, the label’s parent organiza-tion.
It featured 12 acts on two stag-
es at The Jam. 
A crowd of about 500 students 
and Gainesville locals moved between indoor and outdoor 
stages in what Veronica Arenas, 
part owner of The Jam and a UF alumna, said might be one of the 
largest shows she has seen at the 
venue.
“What I ﬁ  nd in Gainesville is 
the density of incredible musical talent,” Arenas said. “It’s a com-
bination of the university and 
Gainesville culture.”  
Although Swamp Records 
Head Director Rachel Ring said she plans to work with student 
bands, the showcase on Friday 
included bands comprised of UF alumni. 
Because there are legal barriers 
preventing Swamp Records from 
signing artists, the organization 
is focusing on helping artists get discovered. 
“It’s self-contained in SGP 
right now,” Ring said. “We have 
to ﬁ  gure out what these deals 
will look like and how UF could get involved.”
Alex Sugarman, a 19-year-old 
UF ﬁ  nance sophomore, attended 
the show and said he enjoyed the 
variety of genres represented on stage.   
“I’m proud that Gainesville 
encompasses so many styles of 
music,” Sugarman said.
SGP chairman Daniel Levin 
said SGP focuses on bring-
ing larger acts to the stage, but 
Swamp Records is an avenue for 
smaller bands to get stage time.  
“Swamp Records is going to 
allow us to showcase the local 
talent here in Gainesville,” said 
Levin, a 22-year-old UF industrial 
and systems engineering senior. 
Will Brennan, who headlined 
the showcase, said he knows how 
much of a difference university support can make. 
Back when he was a student, he said, he won Gator Growl’s 
Talent Night and got to perform 
on the main stage as a result.
Soon after, the 25-year-old 
former UF student was on stage at the Stephen C. O’Connell Cen-
ter  opening for Method Man and 
Redman at an SGP show.
Brennan said he wishes 
Swamp Records had been around when he was a student.
He said bands helped by the 
label will see the results of the support they’re receiving.
“That’s like comparing some-
body with a car to somebody 
without one,” Brennan said. “If 
you have a vehicle to get things done, you’re moving miles faster 
than the competition.”MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Alligator mobile app 
now available
You use apps to order pizza, check bus routes and 
view singles in your area — now, you can use one to read the Alligator on the go. 
At the risk of sounding like Billy Mays, you really should 
download it. Like, right now. 
The entire app was designed with you, the readers, 
in mind. We want to make UF and Gainesville news as 
accessible as possible, and we think this is the best way to 
do that.
We know you don’t always have time to grab a paper, 
but you still deserve to get the news. The Alligator app updates in real time and sends breaking-news alerts ﬁ  ltered 
by geographic location. But don’t worry, we won’t spam 
you: Push alerts are authorized by our editor-in-chief, and she hates unnecessary notiﬁ  cations just as much as you do.  
The value of getting our breaking-news alerts is that  
you can ﬁ  nd out which parts of campus to avoid — or ﬂ  ock to — when something happens. This way, when a plane crashes on Flavet Field while thousands of people are tailgating, you’ll immediately know to avoid Museum 
Road. In about a month, when Student Government 
announces its new Student Body president and senators, you can expect a push notiﬁ  cation instead of having to wait for the paper the next day. And if a Gators football player 
is arrested outside a hotel for barking at a police dog, an 
Alligator alert will deliver the news.
Accessing this info via the app on your phone or tablet 
is smoother than using our mobile website. It updates as we do, so when we get more details, you will, too.
Another cool function is our news tip tool, which allows 
users to submit story ideas, photos and letters to the editor with the same effort it takes to send a tweet. See something strange on campus? Snap a pic and share it with us. We’ll 
investigate it so you don’t have to.
The app also makes it easy to skim headlines — you can 
sort through less text to ﬁ  nd the articles you actually want 
to read. It has some interactive ads with built-in coupons as well as exclusive app content you won’t ﬁ  nd in the paper.
Real talk, though: We worked hard to put this app 
together, and we’re hoping you like it. (If you don’t, tell us how to make it better.) We want to maintain our position as the foremost source of news at and around UF, and that 
means making the news easy to consume. We’re excited — 
and a bit nervous — to take this new adventure with you.

As always, thank you for reading, no matter which 
format you choose.Temps decrease, masturbation increases
Temperatures have dropped and so have our pants, 
apparently. With the cold weather, one method of staying warm has increased: masturbation.
Pornhub released statistics regarding pornography 
consumption and the Polar Vortex from earlier this month. Compared to normal averages, website trafﬁ  c increased by 37.2 percent in Florida during the Vortex. 
Pornography consumers in Florida also visited more 
than double the amount of Pornhub pages than any other state, topping the chart with 28.4 percent more time on the site than normal averages compared to the runner-up Georgia’s 11.6 percent increase. 
Even though our weather has been nowhere near as 
cold as the Northeast, we Floridians use any excuse to stay in and watch some strangers have sex. Stay classy, guys.
Although pornography and masturbation do not al-
ways go hand in hand — or should I say hand in pants — there is deﬁ  nitely a correlation between them. 
Let’s be real: I’m sure you don’t actually want to get 
all bundled up and leave your apartment or dorm room. And why leave the comfort of your bed, couch or shower — I’m not judging — when you could just stay there and entertain yourself?
In addition to being, well, fun, masturbation is great 
for your health. 
According to Men’s Health, masturbation keeps your 
blood pressure, reproductive system and brain in tip-top shape. 
Speciﬁ  c to you gentlemen, masturbating can help you 
last longer. So, when you’re doing the real deal, you won’t ﬁ  nish before your partner has his or her fun.
If classes are bringing you down, having an orgasm is a 
great de-stresser. When you’re feeling overwhelmed with homework or exams, just take a masturbation break. But please, just don’t do that during the actual exam. 
Masturbating is also a great sleep aid. If you have an 
early class but aren’t tired, jack your way off to sleep. Don’t think masturbating is 
just a solo act, either. One of the best beneﬁ  ts is how close it can bring you to your partner.
Masturbating with one anoth-
er is a great way to share what gets you off because you can see exactly how and where your partner likes to be touched. 
Planned Parenthood’s website 
says mutual masturbation is a “safe way to explore sexual activity with another person with no risk for pregnancy or STDs.” It’s also a great form of intimacy if you and your partner aren’t ready for actual intercourse yet. 
Even when you are alone, masturbating is a big help 
to your sex life. When you become more comfortable with what turns you on, you’re more comfortable telling that to your partner so they can help get you off. 
Masturbating is a totally normal part of life and of your 
sexuality. It’s nothing to be embarrassed about.
However, we are in college, so please try to keep it to 
yourself. Dorm rooms are small and no one wants to be kept up by the sound of his or her roommate’s under-the-sheets action.
Also, try to avoid taking matters into your own hands 
in the communal showers. Come on guys, other people go in there to get clean.
Aside from those warnings, make a day of it. Light 
some candles. Put on your favorite dirty video or some good music — my short list is anything off the latest Arctic Monkeys album or by The Weeknd. Invite over a signiﬁ  -cant other; or don’t. 
Call in sick to work or class and spend the day warm-
ing yourself up with your hand in your pants. After all, it’s Florida — we only have a few cold days left.

Slate for Swamp Party
Dear University of Florida students,
My name is Agassy Rodriguez, and I serve as the Swamp 
Party President. I am truly excited to represent the party this semester, as I have been involved with the Swamp Party since its inception in Fall 2012. I cannot wait to see how the party will continue growing this semester.
Student Government elections are here once again, but 
what does that even mean really? It means that you will have a chance to become involved with one of the largest student governments in the country and represent students from across the campus. 
If you are a student who wants to make a difference in the 
issues facing our campus, then come slate for Swamp Party for a chance to campaign for your very own Senate seat! The slating process consists of interviewing with the party you are interested in to be selected as a candidate for the area you hope to represent. 
Why should you choose to slate for Swamp Party? Simple: 
We are the most experienced leaders in SG and we have the passion to enact change on our campus. We are a diverse col-lection of leaders from across campus that are dedicated to enhancing your student experience at UF. To ﬁ  nd out more information about Swamp Party, visit swamppartyuf.com.

Swamp Party PresidentLetter to the Editor
After months of criticism re-
garding the National Secu-rity Agency’s data collec-
tion program, last week, President 
Barack Obama announced changes 
to the program. No longer will the 
NSA be allowed to collect phone records of average citizens as it currently does in its never-ending 
quest to seek out the bad guys who threaten 
the United States.
Although we can and should appreci-
ate Obama’s effort to end parts of the NSA’s 
controversial phone data collection program, 
many aspects of the NSA’s work were left 
largely unchanged. Now, the NSA must get a 
court order from the Federal Intelligence Sur-veillance Court — or FISA — to collect phone data, and there must be some belief that the 
data collected has a connection to a potential 
terrorism suspect. 
However, the changes don’t get to the heart 
of the problem: our inability to move forward 
from 9/11. 
It’s been more than 12 years since the 9/11 
attacks, and in that time, the U.S. has found it-self paralyzed by fear of the next attack. The actions taken by George W. Bush’s administra-tion hardly helped. Rather than spending all 
of our resources ﬁ  nding and eliminating the 
terrorist threat, we invaded Iraq, which in turn 
helped destabilize an already fragile part of the world, left suspected terrorists imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay with little hope of a trial or due process, and we entered a world where the NSA is always listening. 
After 12 years, it’s time to leave an aw-
ful decade of war and despair behind us and move forward. Heck, most of you reading this right now have probably spent the vast major-ity of your life never knowing a United States that wasn’t at war. 
That’s frightening and very sad.Thankfully, we’ve left Iraq, are in the pro-
cess of leaving Afghanistan, and ﬁ  nally start-ing to roll back some of the egregious viola-tions of our civil liberties that Congress stole as a result of the Patriot Act. 
Despite all of that, we’ve had to deal with 
rampant spying by our own government agen-cies, legislative and executive branches unable to come to an agreement on how to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and 
the nonstop use of drones to 
perpetuate the war on terror, of-
ten with tragic results. 
After a decade of living in 
fear of the next attack, it’s past 
time to end the mindset that a terrorist is lurk-
ing around the corner and that our intelligence 
services must do everything — including col-lecting data from everyone’s phone calls — just to prevent the next attack. The FBI, CIA and 
yes — to an extent — the NSA has done a won-
derful job preventing possible terrorist attacks 
on American soil since 9/11, but the additional cost to American liberty is unnecessary. 
Should the NSA have the ability to listen to 
suspected terrorists or those with connections 
to suspected terrorists?
Absolutely. 
Should they also have the ability to hear 
our phone calls, look at our emails or see what 
we’re up to on social networking sites for no 
reason?
Absolutely not. 
In no way am I saying we need to let our 
guard down completely because there are 
awful people in the world who mean to do 
us harm. We can, however, prevent potential 
terrorists from carrying out their heinous acts without completely eroding our freedom in the process. 
I support Obama, voted for him twice and 
spent much of 2008 working on his campaign, but I can say without a doubt in my mind that one of his biggest disappointments has been his inability to end the Bush-era blunders that dogged this country for longer than a decade. 
The government is perfectly capable of 
protecting our nation against all enemies — foreign or domestic — without any of us hav-ing to live in fear of having our own freedom compromised by overzealous bureaucrats. Obama’s reforms are a start, but this needed to happen years ago.

opinions@alligator.orgFacebook was found-
ed 10 years ago. It’s no surprise the social 
platform has undergone many changes while it has 
been around. Although it 
looks different now, the key idea is the same: connecting with friends. Now add businesses into the mix.
Rather than seeing every single 
post from every single friend, Face-book ﬁ  lters your news feed based on your recent interactions with its lat-est algorithm. For $6.99, you can pay 
Facebook to promote your personal 
posts.
A post to your personal page ini-
tially goes out to a small fraction of your friends. If they like the post and interact with it, more friends will see it. Over time, friends and pages you no longer interact with disappear from your news feed. For those with 
more than 1,000 friends, there has to 
be some sort of ﬁ  ltering. Otherwise, it would be too overwhelming.
“Facebook fades friends out the 
same way we do,” said Jeanette Ri-vera, a public relations senior. “Even-tually, if we see them in person, that’s when those personal interactions come into place. You become interest-
ed in seeing that person’s proﬁ  le, and 
they come back into your news feed.”
It’s not that no one cares about the 
posts you share. It’s probably just that no one has seen it or interacted with your post. The most popular posts seem to be photos, funny articles and memes.
“I use Facebook for student orga-
nizations to advertise our meetings, to 
read and share articles and to connect 
with my friends,” Rivera said.
Advertising has always been prev-
alent on Facebook. What started as a social network has now moved to-ward a proﬁ  table business model.
“I started noticing the change in the 
past two years when Facebook started becoming a more strategic marketing outlet instead of a social outlet,” Ri-vera said. “I feel that Twitter and Ins-
tagram ﬁ  ll that void now.”When it comes to posts 
about her personal social 
life, Rivera said she would not pay to promote them.
I asked a few students 
if they thought Facebook 
would still be relevant in ﬁ  ve years. The answers were mixed.
Some reactions were a deﬁ  nite ‘no’ 
and went as far as to hail Facebook as “the next Myspace.”
Others, however, seem to still have 
faith in Facebook. As social media continues to change and adapt to peo-
ple’s needs, Facebook could still be a 
contender in the ring.
“It will remain relevant as long as 
they continue to buy out their com-petitors,” said Raven Hurst,  a com-munication media production senior.
Facebook has been around for a 
decade, but could it last another?
By controlling the content that Fa-
cebook users can see, Facebook can potentially force users’ hands to pay for a greater organic reach. The lines between content creator and advertis-er are blurred, and everyone becomes an ‘advertisement’ commercializing their social life.
Rivera explained that she did not 
initially “like” Buzzfeed on Facebook. 
After many of her friends shared 
content from Buzzfeed, it eventually became a suggestion in her Timeline, urging her to like the page.
No one clicks on the ads in the 
sidebar, but now that advertising has immersed itself into our Timelines, Facebook found a way to commercial-ize our content. 
Who would pay to promote a pho-
to of the croissant they had for break-fast this morning? 
I probably wouldn’t pay to pro-
mote any of my content. 
I believe if my content is good in 
quality and people enjoy it, it pays for itself. 
It really depends on what you uti-
lize Facebook for.

Fans who packed into the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center 
this weekend had a little less 
leg room than usual.
The University Athletic As-
sociation surpassed its goal for 
its Pack the Dome weekend, 
welcoming more than 26,000 
fans into the stadium for four sporting events — about 1,000 spectators more than the cam-paign’s target attendance. 
“It was a big weekend for 
us,” said Michael Ward, assis-tant director of marketing for UAA. “It seems like we always have one of these in January, 
these weekends that are kind 
of crazy for us as a marketing staff, but deﬁ  nitely events that we love to put on because we 
love the reaction on the fans’ 
faces.”
The weekend featured gym-
nastics on Friday; swimming and diving and men’s basket-
ball on Saturday; and women’s 
basketball on Sunday.
To draw in crowds, the 
weekend included several 
special events and giveaways, 
such as the annual men’s bas-ketball T-shirt giveaway game and a commemorative drink-ing glass giveaway at the gym-nastics meet. 
“I sent an email out to our 
gameday staff, and it prob-ably had 13 bullet points of all the events we had going on,” Ward said.
He said extensive planning 
and coordination for months 
in advance go into making 
multisport promotions run smoothly.
Austin Pleasants, an 18-
year-old UF biomedical en-gineering freshman, said he went to all four games this 
weekend. He said he even 
camped outside overnight for front-row seats at the men’s basketball game. He was at the O’Connell Center for more 
than 24 hours.
“At the women’s basketball 
game today, there were a lot of 
people here, and a lot of them 
I heard talking about the Pack 
the Dome event,” he said, “and that’s why it’s pretty crowded today.”
Josh Beychok, an 18-year-
old UF economics freshman, 
said promotions like this give 
an incentive to fans to attend sports that typically receive less attention.
“It deﬁ  nitely increases my 
likelihood of going to them, like a gymnastics (meet) or a swimming and diving (event),” he said. “I’d go either 
way to the basketball games, 
but for other events, deﬁ  nitely, that plays a part in it.”Gators fans pile in

CRIME
JENNA LYONS
Alligator Staff Writer jlyons@alligator.org
Gainesville Police arrested a lo-
cal man Saturday after police said 
he charged at his nephew with a knife during an argument about 
undercooked noodles.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 54-year-old 
Richard Vine Newton on charges 
of aggravated assault and domes-tic battery, according to an arrest report.
At about midnight at Gardenia 
Gardens Apartments, Newton’s nephew told him the noodles Newton made were undercooked, according to the report. Newton started screaming and shoved him in the face. Then, his nephew 
shoved him back and left the apart-
ment they share. 
He went to another apartment 
in the complex, where Newton fol-lowed him. They started arguing again, and Newton rushed toward him with the knife while making slashing motions, according to the report.
Newton’s nephew was not in-
jured and kept his distance from Newton until police arrived.The witness who called 911 told 
police Newton was drinking alco-hol throughout the night, accord-ing to the report.
During questioning, Newton 
said he had been drinking and said it can affect his demeanor. He said the argument never got physical and denied picking up the knife.
Ofﬁ  cers found a kitchen knife 
behind the front door of the apart-ment, according to the report.
Newton was booked into the 
Alachua County Jail at about 2 a.m., where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $7,500 bond.Gainesville man boils over in 
noodles argument, later arrested“I sent an email out to 
our game day staff, and 
it probably had 13 bullet 
points of all the events 
we had going on.”

Baseball alumni day
Florida announced on Saturday that the baseball 
program would hold Alumni Day on Feb. 8. The festivities include a home run derby and a barbecue.
Stefani Stojic clinched 
two matches for UF’s women’s tennis team this weekend. Read the 
story on page 14. Gators in the Senior Bowl
Former UF football players Jon Halapio and Solomon Patton competed at the Senior Bowl on Saturday in Mobile, Ala. Patton returned a kickoff for 27 yards, and Halapio played most of the game at right guard.JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
For the first three games of the 
season, the Gators’ offense went 
through Casey Prather. Nearly 
a third of the team’s total points 
scored came from the senior for-ward.
But as the season progressed, 
Scottie Wilbekin was reinstated from his suspension, Michael Fra-zier II gained more confidence shooting the ball and the front-court came into its own with ef-
ficient play from Patric Young, 
Dorian Finney-Smith and Will Yeguete.
After defeating Tennessee 67-
41, coach Billy Donovan said No. 6 Florida’s offense is finally balanc-ing out and using all of its weap-ons in its arsenal. 
“We were behind in terms of 
these guys playing together be-cause of suspension, injuries and a lack of cohesiveness,” Donovan said. 
“Right when we were going into 
the (Southeastern Conference), we were not utilizing our personnel to the best of our ability. It wasn’t out of selfishness; it was just a lack of 
awareness. And I think we’re get-
ting better at that.”
Wilbekin, Young and others 
have lifted some of the weight off 
Prather’s shoulders in terms of 
scoring, and the Gators are now the only SEC team with five play-ers averaging more than 10 points per game. 
Each one of the five has also led 
the team in scoring in at least one game this season.
In three of Florida’s previous 
four games against Georgia, Ala-bama and Tennessee, Frazier has 
led the charge by scoring a team-
high 21, 18 and 17 points, respec-tively.
But on Jan. 18 at Auburn, the 
sophomore guard was held score-less for the first time this season, 
leaving Donovan to rely on his 
other offensive threats to pick up the slack.
“Auburn had made a real con-
scious effort to take Michael Fra-zier out of the game and Michael 
Frazier was 0 for 2, very, very 
frustrated and didn’t get a lot of looks,” Donovan said. 
“It was one of those games 
where they just basically said, ‘We’re not giving this guy a three-point shot.’
“Like I tell our guys all the 
time, you don’t know whose night it’s going to be in terms of having a big offensive night.”
Rather than let the performance 
of one player dictate the outcome 
of the game, the Gators shared 
the wealth against the Tigers as Prather, who had not led the team in scoring since Dec. 21 against 
Fresno State, jumped back on top 
of the leaderboard with 21 points.

Florida offense finding balance during conference play
GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
The Gators snapped their three-
game skid with authority Sunday after-
noon in the O’Connell Center. 
After three consecutive subpar 
offensive performances, Florida ex-ploded for 87 points and a 46.8 shoot-ing percentage in its 87-69 victory over 
Auburn. 
Senior guard Jaterra Bonds led the 
way for the Gators (14-6, 4-3 Southeast-
ern Conference), notching 18 points, six boards and five assists.
“It feels really good,” Bonds said, 
“especially when you get an 18-point win against a team who’s been very hot lately.”Bonds was perhaps most impres-
sive from the charity stripe. As a whole, 
Florida was 21-for-26 from the free-
throw line, compared to Auburn’s 13-for-26 clip. 
“The key 
to the game 
was sticking 
to our game plan, and that 
was attacking the gaps,” Bonds said. 
“We knew they were going to be big up 
front, so we just wanted to get it out of our hands quick and flash to the mid-dle and attack from the corner. We just wanted to get it to the seams and make 
them make a play defensively.”UF snaps losing streakGyMnAS ticS

When Bridget Sloan finished her floor 
routine Friday night, a crowd of more than 
10,000 fans who gathered to see Florida (3-0, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) compete against Georgia erupted.
Her official score was not calculated yet, 
but as the sophomore’s floor music — “Seven Nation Army” by The White Stripes — con-cluded, there was no rest in the O’Connell Center.
Sloan, the rest of the team and everyone 
in the crowd knew they had just witnessed perfection.
When the scoreboard displayed Sloan’s 
perfect 10, the arena almost shook. 
Then, the Gators did it again. Junior Kytra 
Hunter followed up Sloan’s floor routine with another 10.The back-to-back performances sealed the 
victory for the Gators, who defeated the Bull-dogs (2-3, 1-1 SEC),198.05-196.70.
“After she went and after she landed her 
last pass, it was just like an explosion in the O’Dome,” Sloan said. “Competing to-gether, we feed off of each other.”
Florida finished its first 
three events (vault, uneven bars and beam) leading Georgia by 0.825.
“We started out and we didn’t stick a 
vault, not one,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “And that’s kind of what we expected.”
Florida claimed overall wins in all three 
events except for bars, which Georgia won with a 49.600 — much to Faehn’s surprise.
“Bars was a little bit of a surprise because Sloan, Hunter perfect on floor

Freshman Stefani Stojic has a new 
nickname.
“Stefani the clincher!” senior Al-
exandra Cercone screamed as UF cel-
ebrated its second straight win of the season.
After Sunday’s match, maybe the 
name will stick. 
Stojic won her second consecutive 
meet-clinching match as No. 2 Florida (2-0) shut out Harvard (1-1) 4-0 in the ITA Kickoff Weekend Championship 
at the Ring Tennis Complex.
“I’m very proud of her; I can’t tell 
you the strides that she has made 
since we started practicing in Au-
gust,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
“She’s very fast and she’s looking to use her athleticism now when she competes, and that’s going to make her very difﬁ  cult to beat.”Stojic won her match 6-3, 6-3 to 
advance Florida to the National Team Indoor Championships in Charlot-tesville, Va. But before Stojic sealed the win, her teammates contributed 
to the shutout with dominant perfor-
mances. 
Freshman Kourtney Keegan and 
senior Soﬁ  e Oyen swept both of their singles matches in straight 6-0 sets.
“In singles, [Kourtney and Soﬁ  e] 
were like a choo-choo train; you couldn’t stop them,” Thornqvist said. “Not only were they very, very good 
offensively, but I thought they made 
very few errors on top of that.”
The Keegan-Oyen tandem also 
teamed up in doubles for the second game in a row and won 6-4 to give 
UF a 1-0 lead before starting singles 
play.
“We played together in Vegas for 
the ﬁ  rst time, and it went really well from the start,” Oyen said. “I love 
playing with [Kourtney]. She’s so re-
laxed, she has such a good serve, and we have such great chemistry so that helps a lot too.”
Oyen, Keegan and Stojic combined 
to score all four points for the Gators in the second meet of its back-to-back shutout. Florida’s freshmen have 
been paramount to the team’s early 
season success. 
“[The seniors] have all kind of gone 
through it so they’re kind of easing us into it,” Stojic said. 
“We’ve trained hard and we’re 
doing the right things. They’re show-ing us what we need to know about everything, so I think that’s really 
helped us a lot.”
While the freshmen have found 
their rhythm early, the seniors are 
still looking to improve their play. 
Seventeenth-ranked senior Olivia 
Janowicz won in doubles but strug-gled slightly in the No. 1 spot, as did Cercone on Saturday against Louis-ville. 
“In singles play, I think was the 
ﬁ  rst time [Olivia] played one on the show court, and I think that moment got to her a little,” Thornqvist said. “Maybe a little bit of that happened 
to Alex [on Saturday], too.” 
Despite a slow start from the se-
niors, the Gators do not lack strong 
play from the rest of the team. 
Wednesday, Florida will try to win its 
127th regular-season home game in a row when UCF visits.
“We’re all excited to play and we’re 
so ready for this season,” Oyen said.

and play our best tennis again.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 2014

Freshman clinches second straight match
� LIPMAN WON CLINCHING MATCH.
LAWRENCE LAGUNA 
Alligator Writer @LagunaLawrence
When Maxx Lipman entered the Ring Tennis 
Complex for Sunday’s match against TCU, he 
hoped to make an impact for Florida.
After earning the match-clinching point, the 
freshman’s hopes were more than fulﬁ  lled.
Lipman’s singles victory against Jhonathan 
Gonzalez in straight sets (6-5(4), 6-2) clinched the match for the Gators (3-0) against  TCU (1-1) 4-2 in the ITA Kickoff Championship on Sunday.
Studying his opponent and never backing 
down worked to Lipman’s beneﬁ  t as he came away with two victories. 
“I really buckled down and played a really 
good tiebreaker, played really smart,” Lipman 
said. “He started making a few more errors, got a 
little nervous, and I tried to capitalize on that.”
Lipman fell into a 5-3 deﬁ  cit in the ﬁ  rst set but 
mounted a comeback against Gonzalez to win the set in a tiebreaker 7-4.
Coach Bryan Shelton said Lipman is a strong 
player to work with because he uses different skills on the court while competing. He can go heavy with his forehand and push opposing play-
ers off the court with strong volleys.
Along with sophomore Gordon Watson, Lip-
man earned the ﬁ  rst doubles victory of the match 
to lead UF into position for the doubles point. 
Redshirt sophomore Diego Hidalgo and senior 
Spencer Newman would go on to win their dou-bles match as well to seal the point for Florida. 
Hidalgo and Newman won in a competitive 
tiebreaker 7-3 to win six games to ﬁ  ve. 
“We’re very resilient,” Shelton said. “We didn’t 
close it out and a lot of teams would’ve put their heads down at that point. 
“But I thought Spencer did a good job as the 
leader out there to make sure Diego kept his head high and continue to battle in the tiebreaker.”
UF won three of its singles matches in straight 
sets.

“In singles, [Kourtney and 
Soﬁ  e] were like a choo-choo 
train; you couldn’t stop them. 
Not only were they very, very 
good offensively, but I thought 
they made very few errors on 
top of that.”
Roland Thornqvist
UF coachDonovan said not diversifying the offense is 
a recipe for failure because coaches will focus on 
the sole offensive scorer to shut down the team’s 
production, as Auburn attempted to do by tak-
ing Frazier out of the game.
When the offense ran through Prather earlier 
in the year, Florida struggled to find consistent 
scoring when its opponent would shut him out. 
Against Wisconsin in the second game of the sea-son, Prather managed only 12 on the road, which led to the Gators’ first loss.
Now, only 20.8 percent of the squad’s scoring 
is from Prather. Players such Young, who went from averaging 6.7 points per game after the first three games of the season to 10.6 following the win against Tennessee, have stepped up to cre-
ate balance. Donovan said the Gators offensive 
attack against the Volunteers was one of the most balanced games they have had this season. Finney-Smith fell just one point shy of reaching double digits Saturday, but Florida still had four 
others with 10 or more points.
“You want four to six guys in double figures,” 
Donovan said. 
“I’ve never been a big believer of just having 
one guy. I just think you want to be balanced. 
On any given night, I want people to look at our 
team and say, ‘Geez, this guy’s had 18, this guy 
scored 25 and this guy’s done this.’”that’s our best events,” Faehn said. “Our athletes were a little 
bit frustrated.”
Faehn attributes the unexpected perfect scores to a strong 
start on floor, beginning with Mackenzie Caquatto, who came back from an 8.40 on floor at UCLA to a 9.95 during Friday’s meet. She earned an event win with her 9.95 on beam.
“Having her out there as a senior and then igniting and 
doing such a great routine really lit everybody else up,” Faehn said.
The next Gator to continue the streak was Rachel Spicer, 
who had struggled on vault (9.825) and beam (9.500) earlier in the meet.
“Then Spicey went up, and that was the best floor routine 
I’ve ever seen her do,” Faehn said. “Everyone just kind of caught on fire from there.”
Sloan and Hunter, who tied for the all-around win with a 
score of 39.70, now join Caquatto as the only current mem-bers of the roster to have scored 10s in their college careers.
The Gators broke the school floor record of 49.725, previ-
ously set in 2013 at the NCAA Super Six finals, with Friday’s 49.875.
“Our first meet we didn’t do so hot on floor and it just 
goes to show you how much depth we have,” Hunter said. 
“I still believe that this is better than what we were last 
year.”
The last time two Gators put up back-to-back perfect 
scores was March 22, 1996, when Amy Myerson and Kristen Guise scored perfect 10s on uneven bars.
“Honestly I never would have thought I’d get a 10 on 
floor,” Sloan said. “Floor is a good event for me, but I’m re-ally pushing for a 10 on beam.”
Although Faehn has never coached back-to-back perfect 
10 scores on any event, she has coached and achieved the feat herself in her personal gymnastics career.
“When I did it the first thing I did was look to the crowd 
because gymnasts love to perform and to do that for every-one in the stands,” Faehn said. “I felt that [Friday night], like when Bridget and Kytra did it.
“They’ll always have that memory of what it felt like to be 
perfect in that moment.”The Tigers (11-9, 2-5 SEC) tried 
to contain Bonds but opened the 
door for fellow senior Lily Svete. Svete, normally a starter, had 
a breakout game, registering 12 points and shooting 3-for-8 from 
beyond the arc coming off the 
bench. “To me, it’s easier to come out 
a little bit more relaxed, because when I start I have a lot of inten-
sity,” she said. 
“As a shooter, I shoot better when I’m more relaxed and I let 
things come to me. My teammates just did a great job of finding me. I 
ran with the offense and ran to the 
open spot, and they passed me the ball.”
Florida not only shot the ball 
well, but also protected it. The Gators committed only 12 turn-overs compared to the Tigers’ 22, and also doubled up Auburn in steals 12-6. 
“To only have 12 turnovers is 
one thing, but to have more assist-ed baskets than turnovers is a great indication that the team’s playing 
well together,” coach Amanda But-
ler said. 
“We took care of the basketball. 
We neutralized the rebounding bat-tle in the second half and also got to 
the free throw line. All these things 
contributed to beating a team that I think is very, very good.” 
At halftime, the Gators were 
leading 41-34. Midway through the second half, Florida busted the game wide open, leading by 23 at the half’s midway point. Thanks to the Gators’ 31-8 run in the first 10 
minutes of the second half, Florida 
cruised to victory. 
“The five that were out there 
just made it happen,” Butler said of 
the run. “It wasn’t necessarily like, 
‘OK, we got to have Jaterra and we gotta have this person.’ Those five just ran with it and brought us a lot of energy. Jan (Miller) was in there and sparked the run. She went right in and attacked the bas-
ket, and right off the bat got a foul 
call.”
Kayla Lewis was a significant 
contributor in essentially neutraliz-
ing the rebounding battle. Auburn 
had a significant size advantage on Florida and won the battle of the boards by 14, but Lewis’ 13 re-bounds were critical to keying the 
Gators to victory.
“This was a big win for us, no 
question,” Butler said. “Before I 
even look at the film, things jump 
out; the way Lily shot, the big 
plays JT made, the rebounds Kayla grabbed, the way January played the second half. 
“Everybody made plays and 
gave energy.”MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

After securing seven event 
victories and two meet re-
cords, the UF track and field team left the Rod McCravy 
Memorial in Lexington, Ky., 
with a better understanding 
of its depth.
Coach Mike Holloway felt 
unsatisfied after falling short 
of expectations in the men’s 
distance medley relay on the 
opening day of competition on Friday, but he did not let the men’s team dwell on the 
rough start. On the final day 
of events, the Gators had a dif-
ferent mindset.
The No. 2 men dominated 
the 800-meter dash with a 
first-place finish on Saturday  
to regain their footing. 
“I was really proud of the 
men’s 800m runners,” Hollo-
way said. 
“I challenged them last 
night after we didn’t have such a great DMR to trust our training, and they really stepped up to the plate [Sat-urday].”
Sean Obinwa finished 
in first place in the event in 1:48.20, while freshman mid-dle-distance runner Donnie Lee Jr. logged a time of 1:51.03 in his first collegiate 800-meter race. 
Sophomore Ryan Schnulle 
(1:49.13) finished in fifth place and freshman Andres Arroyo (1:49.22) came in sixth.
The men’s team also 
proved worthy in the 4x400 relay as Arman Hall closed the final leg for his team. Nick Uruburu, Hugh Gra-
ham Jr., and Ryan Schnulle all gave what their anchor need-ed to pull off a 3:07.20 first place finish, also a new meet record. 
“Any time you can run a 
3:07.20 in the men’s 4x4 with-out Najee Glass and Dedric Dukes, you’re having yourself a good start,” Holloway said.
The an-
chor also showed up 
in the men’s 4 0 0 - m e t e r run as Hall finished in the top spot with a time 
of 45.84 with teammate Gra-ham Jr. (46.58) just behind in third place.
The No. 3 women also fin-
ished the competition strong. 
Sharing the spotlight 
of success in the women’s 3,000-meter run came the one-two punch of senior Cory Mc-
Gee, who finished in first place 
with a time of 9:18.26, and freshman Rebekah Greene, who ran a 9:18.44.
For the second consecutive 
meet, Eddie Lovett finished first in the men’s 60-meter hurdles. 
Holloway was satisfied 
with Lovett’s performance in hurdles and McGee and Greene’s work in the 3,000m. 
“We take this for what it 
is knowing we did a great job this weekend,” Holloway said. “We’ll get back to Gainesville and get back to work because we have bigger fish to fry down the line.” UF bounces back on

Florida’s roster was a work in 
progress during the Fall season, 
but with three weeks until the 
Southeastern Conference Cham-
pionships, the Gators are round-
ing into postseason form.
The men’s side lacked middle 
and long distance freestylers, and the breaststroke was a bit of a question mark — almost as bad as the same hole the Gator women needed to fill. 
But junior Eduardo Solaeche-
Gomez, has made his mark in the breast events, filling the void Florida had at that position. He 
has the Gators’ top times in both 
the 100- and 200-yard breast this season with the fourth-best swim in the country for the latter event. 
He is a member of the 400-yard 
medley relay that notched an “A” cut at the Ohio State Invitational in late November — the nation’s 
seventh-fastest time.
However, Solaeche-Gomez’s 
impact was something coach 
Gregg Troy had foreseen. Some-thing the coaching staff did not 
see coming was the slew of school 
records the women’s team would break this season — six — includ-ing both breast events by senior 
Hilda Luthersdottir. 
The Icelandic Olympian 
emerged as the dominant breast-
stroker for the Gators this season, a spot that was wide open in Sep-
tember.
“We were tremendously fortu-nate in the fall,” Troy said. “Hilda Luthersdottir has taken her swim-
ming to a whole new level. So where the breaststroke used to be a weak spot for us, right now, 
she’s one of the (10) fastest in the 
country. It makes all our relays click.”
Florida has qualified “A” cuts 
in all five relays.
The addition of freshman free-
styler Mitch D’Arrigo gave the men solid production in the 500- and 1,000-yard free all season, but 
Saturday’s dual meet against the 
Tigers saw three Gators put up national top-five times in the 1,000 free. Sophomores Ryan Rosen-baum, second, and Arthur Fray-
ler, third, and D’Arrigo, fifth, all 
went under 9:05 in the event.Florida solidifying roster for SECs
