UF ASSAULTS

The reward for the tip that leads 
to the arrest of the suspect in UF’s 
recent sexual assaults has swelled to $1,750.
The Crime Stoppers fund was 
established on Sept. 12 through a $500 donation from Nick West, the owner of West Farms Landscape Services in Gainesville. It grew by 
$250 in the last 11 days.
Crime Stoppers pays the ﬁ  rst 
$1,000 for a tip leading to a convic-
tion.
West, 71, said he remembers the 
helplessness he and his family felt 
in 1990 when Danny Rolling mur-
dered ﬁ  ve college students. Rolling was later convicted then executed 
in 2006. 
West said he felt they could do something this time. 
“We feel like when people send 
their child to Gainesville to go to school it sort of becomes all of our 
responsibilities, all of us who live here, to help look after them,” he said. 
To chip in to the fund, send a 
check to P.O. Box 2603 Gainesville, FL 32602, with a letter pledging money to the tip that helps arrest the suspect in the three August 
and September assaults. 
The money will remain in the 
account for a year and will be re-
turned unless donors renew their pledges. 
Tips on the suspect can be sub-
mitted to Crime Stoppers at 352-372-7867.Reward increased for info regarding UF assaults

The UF community is working to under-
stand the Ebola virus as it continues to spread 
through West Africa.
Students in the Health in Africa Working 
Group (HIA) and the UF Center for African 
Studies will be focusing their research on the Ebola outbreak this year.
This fall, the group added about 30 un-
dergraduate students to its graduate research 
team.  
Sharon Abramowitz, an assistant profes-
sor of anthropology and African studies, said 
the group, founded in 2012, has rapidly put 
together an organizational structure and com-munications with students, including a wiki page that is the compilation of their research.
“The interest and passions concerning the 
Ebola outbreak are really strong among the un-dergraduate population,” Abramowitz said.
Ebola Virus Disease is transmitted from 
wild animals to humans and is often fatal, 
according to the World Health Organization. 
Once infected, humans can spread the virus UF students conduct research on Ebola virus

UF’s Levin College of Law is 
making a comeback after dropping 
in rankings last spring.
UF now ranks No. 1 in Florida for 
the percentage of law students who 
passed the bar exam and No. 13 for 
“Best Value Law School,” according 
to The National Jurist magazine.
George Dawson, the UF Law in-
terim dean, said students get a valu-
able education at a reasonable price, and the law school will continue to provide students with the resources they need to succeed. 
“If we continue to do what we’re 
doing and our tuition continues to stay the same, I think we’ll continue 
to be high on the rankings,” he said.
In spring, the U.S. News & 
World Report ranked Florida State 
University above UF for the best law school. The drop came at a time when the UF college was in a transi-tioning phase to ﬁ  nd a new dean for the school after Dean Robert Jerry 
retired. 
When President Bernie Machen 
put the search for the new law dean 
on hold last spring, Dawson took over as interim dean for the college. UF Levin 
law school moves up in rankings

Bags of frozen meats, canned 
food and cartons of milk were 
given to needy Alachua County residents Monday at the Salva-tion Army of Gainesville on West 
University Avenue.
The distribution was orga-
nized by Nourishment Network, 
a North Florida-based food bank that serves nonprofit agencies in 17 counties in the state.
Nourishment Network is hold-
ing a series of events in an attempt to provide 4.5 million pounds of 
free food to about 18,000 needy 
families. The single-day events started in July and will be com-pleted by the end of this month.
Chris Hughes, a U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture program manager at the food bank, said they received 30 to 40 thousand pounds of food to distribute at the local event. The program in-tended for each household to take home 50 to 100 pounds.
Salvation Army Corps Officer 
Lt. Preston Lewis said the Salva-tion Army and Nourishment Net-work hoped to help 500 people, and they far exceeded that goal. Residents were lined up at 7 a.m. — three hours before the distri-bution started — and he had to cut the line off before noon.
Emma Holt, who has volun-
teered with Nourishment Net-work for the past 14 years, said the event was originally planned to serve a smaller number of peo-ple.
“At first we were going to do 
200 people, then 400 and then 500,” Holt said. “We could’ve brought food for 1,000, but we don’t have the volunteers.”
Gainesville resident Joyce 
Johnson volunteered at the event with her fiance. It was her first time volunteering with Nourish-
ment Network and the Salvation 
Army.
“There are so many people 
struggling that can’t make ends meet at the end of the month, and this is such a blessing for them,” she said.
Even if not everyone says 
‘thank you,’ she said the appre-
ciation of the community is re-
flected in turnout numbers.
“This should wake people 
up,” she said. “Just because peo-ple aren’t sleeping on the streets doesn’t mean they don’t need help.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
A survey released Monday 
from the Pew Research Center 
indicates American support for same-sex marriage could be leveling off after several years 
of dramatic growth in accep-
tance of equal rights for gays and lesbians.
The study’s authors cau-
tion it’s too soon to draw any definitive conclusions. But the new poll released Monday found a drop from 54 percent to 49 percent since February in 
Americans who want legal rec-
ognition for same-sex relation-ships. The percentage of those 
opposed increased during that 
same period, from 39 percent in February to 41 percent last month.
The poll of 2,002 adults, con-
ducted Sept. 2-9, has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.
“Since we’ve seen this up-
ward trend for so long, we’re cautious because it’s too early to say what this means for long-term trends,” said Jessica Mar-tinez, a researcher in Pew’s Re-ligion and Public Life Project. 
The campaign for recogni-
tion of gay marriage has grown to become a broad mass move-ment supported in recent years by a majority of Americans. A decade ago, only about 30 percent of Americans accepted same-sex marriage. Now, 19 states and the District of Co-
lumbia recognize gay marriage, while petitions for recognition 
in several other states are mov-ing through the courts.
The Gallup organization 
said support for gay marriage first rose above the 50-percent mark in its surveys in 2011 and 
has remained above half since. 
Gallup’s latest survey this past May found acceptance of gay marriage at a new high of 55 percent. But the group’s re-searchers found support was increasing by smaller margins than it had during the era of fastest growth so far, between 
2009 and 2011.
Martinez said the drop in 
support in the Pew poll was 
not driven by any particular re-ligious or political group in the sample, but was a change across the board. Pew used similar groups of respondents in terms of political and religious views 
for both surveys, she said. The 
percentage of Americans who told Pew they were undecided on gay marriage increased from 7 percent in February to 10 per-cent last month.
Robert Jones, chief executive 
of Public Religion Research In-stitute, a nonprofit group that 
conducts surveys on religion 
and public life, said it’s par-ticularly challenging to inter-pret surveys on gay marriage because the numbers have changed so dramatically over a very short period. 
“The fundamentals under-
neath the trend remain very sol-
id — in the generational breaks 
that are driving this,” Jones said. “The long-term curve on this trend doesn’t show any re-treat.”Poll: Support for gay

NEW YORK — A day after 
100,000 people marched to warn 
that climate change is destroying the Earth, more than a thousand activists gathered Monday in lower 
Manhattan’s financial district chant-
ing, carrying signs and — in some places — sitting down in the street to protest what they said was corpo-rate and economic institutions’ role in the climate crisis.
There were reports of some 
isolated arrests of protesters, who police said did not obtain a permit for the rally. But, by and large, the police, office workers and tourists alike watched as the activists chant-ed: “We can’t take this climate heat; 
we’ve got to shut down Wall Street,” 
and bounced two large, inflatable 
balloons meant to represent carbon 
dioxide bubbles. Police later punc-tured the balloons.
The organizers of #FloodWall-Street said the sit-in aimed to dis-rupt business in the financial district by targeting “corporate polluters and those profiting from the fossil fuel industry.”
The protest took a tense turn 
when demonstrators, after several hours of sitting and chanting near the bull statue, decided to march up Broadway and onto Wall Street itself. The protesters encountered 
barricades and a strong police pres-
ence outside the New York Stock Ex-change. Some tried to push through the barricades, and tussles between demonstrators and police ensued. Protesters stage climate crisis sit-in

A man was issued a sworn 
complaint after he trespassed 
on UF property for a second 
time Monday afternoon. 
David Lee Patterson went 
to Library West to check out a book shortly after noon, said University Police Sergeant 
Nick Konopka. Staff looked 
up his name in their public trespass file, and Patterson’s 
name came up for a warning 
issued last month. 
The library called UPD, 
and officers responded short-ly before 1 p.m. 
As he was about to be 
arrested, Patterson had a medical episode, and Emer-gency Medical Services were 
called. 
EMS responded around 
1:30 p.m., and Patterson was transported to the Malcom 
Randall VA Medical Center.
Because of his medical 
episode, a sworn complaint was filed.

A convicted felon was ar-
rested after officers found a gun hidden in a McDonald’s 
bag during a traffic stop Sun-
day evening.
At about 6 p.m., Kendal M. Darby was pulled over 
for running a red light at 
1400 SE First Ave. 
Gainesville Police offi-
cers said the 25-year-old ap-peared nervous, according to a report. His hands and chest 
were trembling and he was 
breathing quickly. 
Darby was shaking so 
badly he dropped his wallet while retrieving his driver’s license. He also spilled a box 
of baking soda on the front 
seat and said he was plan-ning on cleaning his car. 
Darby told officers he was 
going to pick up his girl-friend at UF Health Shands 
Hospital, but was headed in 
the opposite direction. 
During a consented 
search, officers found a knife in Darby’s pocket and hand-cuffed him.  
A K-9 unit alerted officers 
to narcotics in the vehicle, and officers found a 9-milli-
meter handgun in a fast food 
bag during the search.
Darby has been convicted 
of felonies before, including aggravated assault with a firearm. He is currently on 
probation for cocaine pos-
session and robbery with a firearm. 
Darby was arrested Sun-
day on charges of possession of firearm by a convicted 
felon.Police roundup: UF

This is an improvement over last year, when FSU ranked higher 
LAw, from page 1They are looking for more faculty help

Symptoms of the Ebola virus include fatigue, head-
aches, diarrhea, vomiting and impaired organ function.
The 2014 outbreak began in March and is most se-
verely affecting the West African countries of Guinea, 
Sierra Leone and Liberia. This is the largest outbreak of 
Ebola since the discovery of the virus in 1976. 
There are no confirmed cases of Ebola in the U.S., ac-
cording to the Center for Disease Control and Preven-tion. The CDC released precautions for universities with students traveling to and from Ebola affected areas. 
“While Ebola poses little risk to the U.S. general pop-
ulation, clinicians are advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of Ebola in patients who have a recent (within 
21 days) travel history to countries where the outbreak 
is occurring or have had contact with a person infected 
with Ebola,” the CDC said in its Advice for Colleges, 
Universities, and Students about Ebola in West Africa. 
Ira Longini, Ph.D., a UF professor in the department 
of biostatistics in the colleges of Public Health and Health 
Professions and Medicine, is on a team of researchers studying the spread of Ebola. 
“We would assume that the U.S. would have suffi-
cient capacity to test people and treat them. We would not expect any real transmission in the U.S.,” Longini said in a press release. The students in HIA are investigating the medical, 
socio-cultural, political and economic impacts of the out-break on affected countries. HIA aims to understand the causes, context and source of the Ebola virus. 
“I have never done this before, but I think that these 
topics specifically are a really great opportunity for fac-
ulty and students to interact regarding these issues,” 
Abramowitz said.
Some students in HIA are pursuing a minor in health 
disparities in society. Trysh Travis, an undergraduate coordinator for women’s studies, oversees this new mi-nor that has only been offered for a year.
Travis said this minor will help UF provide a diverse 
workforce and a new way of thinking.
“There’s a natural link between thinking about 
health care inequities and health care justice in the Unit-ed States and thinking about it in the larger context of a global outbreak,” Travis said. “That’s where the interest in the Ebola outbreak came from, I think.”
The group is considered an interdisciplinary research 
endeavor and is supported by a government grant given to the Center for African Studies at UF, with a grant that  aims to help students join and discuss current research.
They are seeking out additional faculty, graduate stu-
dents and undergraduate students interested in being involved in their research. HIA will be hosting a faculty discussion on the Ebola outbreak Oct. 8. The location is not yet determined.EbOLA , from page 1“These people aren’t

July 2014 Florida Law School bar exam resultsMachen is expected to work on the 
search before he leaves his post in December. 
Out of the 266 UF test-takers, 241 
students passed the bar exam, lead-
ing to a 2.4-percent increase from 
the summer 2013 exam results, Matt Walker, a UF Law Communications spokesman, said. 
The 90.6-percent passing rate is 
higher than UF’s past numbers. 
Dawson said the passing rate for 
the bar exam usually falls between 86 and 88 percent. 
“We’re pleased with the rank-
ing and bar exam results,” Dawson said.
FSU is trailing behind UF’s rank-
ing with a 81.8-percent passing rate, beating the University of Miami School of Law. 
UF scored higher than the Uni-
versity of Tennessee on the “Best Value Law School” ranking, based on the law college’s cost of tuition, student debt, employment and bar passing rates.
Kristy Pinedo-Pimentel, 19, said 
she wants to go to law school out of state, but her biggest factor is fi-
nances.
“If I couldn’t afford to go to any 
other school, I would go to UF law,” 
the political science sophomore said.  
She has toured the Levin College 
of Law and took a sample course that she enjoyed.
“The energy of the professors 
and students would definitely want 
to make me go to UF Law because 
they want to see you succeed,” she said.

BELL, Fla. — Family and friends 
gathered at Bell High School to re-
member six children who were fa-

Some 100 people viewed toys 
and photos displayed inside the 
school’s auditorium Sunday eve-ning.
Authorities say 51-year-old Don-
ald Spirit also killed his daughter, 28-year-old Sarah Spirit, Thursday afternoon at their North Florida

Man bitten by Ebola patient 
flown to Switzerland 
GENEVA — Swiss authorities 
said a male nurse who was bitten 
by an Ebola patient while working in West Africa has been flown to Switzerland as a precaution.
The health ministry said the un-
identified man was working for an international organization in Sierra Leone when he was bitten by a child infected with Ebola on Saturday.
The ministry said the nurse was 
wearing protective gear and is un-likely to have contracted the dis-ease.It said the man, who was flown 
to Switzerland by a private trans-port company Monday, will be kept under observation at Geneva’s Uni-
versity Hospital for the incubation 
period of three weeks.
The ministry said it was the first 
medical transport to Switzerland from the Ebola-affected region.
Woman killed, man missing in

OCALA NATIONAL FOR-

her son is missing after their canoe 
sank during a family outing at Half Moon Lake in the Ocala National Forest.
Florida Fish and Wildlife spokes-
man Greg Workman told the Ocala Star-Banner the canoe began taking on water Sunday evening. Three adults and two children were on board.
Workman says people across the 
lake heard a commotion and at first 
thought the family was just having 
fun. When they noticed the yelling got stronger, they were able to head across and rescue two children and a man.
The woman who drowned was 
the mother of the two men in the canoe. Her son is still missing in the lake. He’s the father of the two chil-dren who were saved.
The search resumed Monday.

top public undergraduate business programs and No. 29 among all public and private business colleges. The numbers mark a decline in the Heavener School rank-
ings.
In 2014, the Heavener School tied for No. 27 in over-
all business programs and tied for No. 16 among public 
school competitors. 
Although the business program’s ranking went 
down in 2015, Dr. Brian Ray, associate dean and direc-
tor of Heavener School of Business, wrote in an email 
that he remains proud of the work the school has done.
“It is gratifying to see that the academic programs 
offered through the Heavener School of Business con-
tinue to rank among the nation’s best,” Ray said. “New 
academic initiatives in global business, entrepreneur-ship, leadership, ethics and communication skills con-tinue to make a significant difference in the caliber of our graduates.”
The Fisher School of Accounting ranked No. 12 
among all U.S. undergraduate accounting programs. 
Barrie Eisenberg, a 19-year-old UF accounting soph-
omore, said the rankings don’t define the college or her 
ability to succeed after graduation.
“It makes me feel great knowing that UF produces 
such high-quality students and that even if our rank-
ings changed I am attending one of the top business col-leges in the country,” Eisenberg said. 
With the opening of the new Heavener Hall in No-
vember, the business program hopes to rise again in the ranks for the U.S. News & World Report’s “2016 Best Colleges” edition.UF business

Donald Craine, the former UF div-
ing coach who died in a boating acci-
dent earlier this year, was responsible for the crash, a Florida Fish and Wild-life report now confirms.
Craine died at the age of 61 after 
being ejected from his 22-foot boat April 24. 
On the day of the accident, Craine 
was on his boat with friend David West near Pine Island off of Cape Cor-al. Another vessel was coming around the same curve as Craine when he col-lided head-on with the other boat. The driver of the other boat, Ken-
neth Krug, was driving his Sea Craft boat and remained within the channel markers. He and his party are not sus-pected of consuming any alcohol. 
The report said Craine was speed-
ing while making a sharp turn in his Pathfinder. He was suspected of con-suming alcoholic beverages and did not remain within channel markers. 
Instead, Craine veered off course and 
hit Krug’s boat. 
West saw Craine facedown in the 
water after he was ejected. West re-trieved Craine from the water, got him onto the Sea Craft with the help of oth-er boaters and administered CPR until Emergency Medical Services arrived, but Craine was pronounced dead.  
Krug and someone else in his party were also ejected from the boat but 
both survived. 
Months later, a report came out 
from the Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission stating Craine was officially the one at fault. 
Craine violated U.S. Coast Guard 
Navigation Rule 14, which states when two parties suspect collision, they should act accordingly in order 
to prevent an accident. Because of 
these navigation rules, Craine violated a Florida statute that states it is unlaw-ful to operate a vessel in a reckless 
manner. 
Craine was the head coach of the 
UF diving team for 30 years and was 
named SEC Diving Coach of the Year four times while at UF.UF diving coach’s accident in April 
ruled a result of safety rule violations
“It is gratifying to see that the academic 
programs offered through the Heavener 
School of Business continue to rank among 
the nation’s best.”

When 23-year-old Kira Kazantsev won the Miss 
America pageant last week, social media users expressed mixed emotions. Some felt her red-cup 
routine in the talent portion of the competition was disap-pointing while others admired her strong stance on raising 
awareness about domestic violence and ending sexual as-
sault in the military.
However, after discovering that Kazantsev had previ-
ously interned for three months at a Planned Parenthood in New York, some people viciously attacked the newly crowned winner. These attacks were fueled by pro-life web-site LifeNews.com, which accused Kazantsev of snufﬁ  ng out the lives of young girls at the nation’s “biggest abortion com-pany.” Subsequently, thousands of Internet users labeled her 
a “bitch,” “slut” and a “bimbo.” Many demanded that Ka-
zantsev be disqualiﬁ  ed from her position, declared her vic-tory a tragedy and announced revulsion at Kazantsev being crowned the new Miss America.
Kazantsev, a triple-major graduate from Hofstra Univer-
sity in New York and a ﬂ  uent speaker of three languages, is an intelligent and conﬁ  dent young woman who is dedicated to public service. Through her internship at Planned Par-enthood, she assisted the organization in teaching children 
about self-esteem and respect.
It is unfair and deeply disturbing that she is being target-
ed with such hateful and outrageous insults simply because 
she supported Planned Parenthood, a nonproﬁ  t organization that provides millions of people with high-quality sexual-health services throughout our country and the world.
Abortion accounts for only 3 percent of Planned Parent-
hood’s services. The organization also provides testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), cancer 
screenings like breast exams and pap smears, contraception, 
counseling and comprehensive sex education. Many men, women and teenagers who are at or below the federal pov-erty line directly beneﬁ  t from these important health services that they might not have access to otherwise.
Considering these facts, it is appalling that a small minor-
ity of Americans attack and demonize Planned Parenthood and anyone associated with it. Research has consistently shown that access to contraception and comprehensive sex education strongly reduces the rate of unin-tended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.
According to a 2012 study 
published in “Obstetrics & Gyne-cology,” the rate of unintended pregnancy signiﬁ  cantly decreases when women have access to free birth control. In addition to reduc-ing the rate of unplanned preg-
nancies in teenagers, wide availability of free contraception cuts the number of abortions by more than half.
Planned Parenthood’s sexual-education programs are 
also a crucial component in improving sexual health. The vast majority of Americans support comprehensive sex edu-cation, which gives people the information they need to lead a responsible and healthy life.
The conclusion is undeniable: Planned Parenthood pro-
vides services that are crucial for our society. Instead of being villainized for her internship at the organization, Kazantsev should be applauded. She assisted in giving people the tools 
they need to stay healthy and safe, and she made a positive 
difference.
I’m proud that our new Miss America believes all people 
deserve to be informed and empowered when it comes to their sexual health. It is unfortunate that a small group of people decided to criticize and bash Kazantsev for her involvement with the organization. These individuals have demonstrated their ignorance about how communities across the country are positively affected by Planned Parenthood.
Just as Planned Parenthood helps educate Americans 
about the importance of healthy and safe sexual interaction, these hateful individuals should educate themselves about the good this organization does in their communities and around the country.
As research shows, a little education goes a long way.

wardrobe scandal 
eclipses real issues
Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Deb-
bie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has had a rough few weeks. 
After a series of gaffes, including harshly criticizing President 
Barack Obama for his response to the recent Mexican border cri-
sis, she inspired an in-depth Politico report on tensions between 
Wasserman Schultz and the rest of the Democratic Party.
The way Politico chose to frame its story on Wasserman 
Schultz is telling. The report opens with a discussion of Was-serman Schultz’s alleged attempts to get the DNC to cover the costs of her wardrobe. It’s true that the DNC probably shouldn’t be paying for politicians’ clothing, even if she is the chair of the committee. But would Politico have highlighted this particular incident if Wasserman Schultz were male?
Politico’s decision to focus heavily on Wasserman Schultz’s 
wardrobe controversy suggests a sexist double standard. This petty attack against Wasserman Schultz overshadows many more signiﬁ  cant concerns. Buried deep in the Politico story is a discussion of Wasserman Schultz’s fundraising tactics.
Although the DNC does not accept contributions from lob-
byists, Wasserman Schultz’s political action committee, DWS PAC, does accept such donations. Wasserman Schultz has at-tempted to distance herself from the PAC, claiming that the 
DWS stands for “Democrats Win Seats.” Wasserman Schultz’s 
ties to the PAC are obvious. According to the Politico story, her father previously served as the PAC’s treasurer, and Jason O’Malley, the PAC’s day-to-day manager, receives a salary that “is split between the DNC, DWS Pac and Wasserman Schultz’s congressional campaign committee.”
Wasserman Schultz’s ridiculous statements distancing her-
self from her own PAC represent a feeble attempt to cover up her ties to Washington lobbyists. Her transparent and weak 
denials represent an insult to the intelligence of the American 
public. If Schultz is accepting hefty contributions from lobbyists, it seems reasonable to expect that those donations will inﬂ  uence her decisions as DNC chair. Rather than jumping through hoops to accept lobbyist money while claiming to be free from its in-ﬂ  uence, Wasserman Schultz should forego such contributions altogether.
Declining donations from powerful special interest groups 
would draw a clear contrast between Democrats and Republi-
cans, who make open displays of their corrupt addiction to lob-
byist money on a regular basis.
Politico does also mention some of Wasserman Schultz’s ac-
complishments during her time as DNC chair. Most notably, she established the Democratic Women’s Alliance, which encour-ages women to participate in the political process by voting and engaging in activism.
Politico’s focus on the trivial issue of Wasserman Schultz’s 
wardrobe is worthy of condemnation. However, the report does raise important questions and concerns about her leadership and the future of the Democratic Party.TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2014

From a young age, I was 
obsessed with read-ing. In middle school, 
I read to get away from the awkward social pressure sur-rounding puberty. In high school, I used reading to relax 
after a long night of study-
ing. I read on the school bus, I read between classes, I read everywhere. Needless to say, I was kind of a huge nerd.
Now in college, I look at 
the stacks of books on top of my dresser and realize most of them have not been read 
in a long time.  They sit scat-
tered on my dresser and gath-er dust, mostly because I am suddenly too busy — and too lazy — to read them. When 
students come to college, 
personal life and academic life are inseparable. There is a huge variety of shiny new 
diversions to attract our at-
tention and an overwhelming pressure to make friends and get involved.
When college students do 
have some relaxation time, we generally turn to social media and online activities like Fa-cebook and Netflix to turn off 
the hectic buzz in our brains 
for a while. We start to forget the exciting thrill of starting a new book. This is a horrible loss for us as students and as 
human beings.
I’m just as much a fan of 
Netflix as the next girl, but 
I’ve realized this year how 
much I’ve missed reading. 
Reading rejuvenates us and motivates us. It broadens your mind and improves your critical thinking skills, 
it helps you learn empathy 
and see other people’s view-points, and it’s just plain fun. Reading is good for you; it’s 
as simple as that.
When I do get the chance 
to read, I am swept away from 
all my exams and the stress of college life. It reminds me of 
how beautiful and complex 
the world really is.
I call upon everyone, col-
lege student or not, to pick 
up a book today. Not a course 
packet for class or a meticu-lously highlighted chemistry textbook, but an actual book.
We are all busy, but we 
all have those odd moments in the day, walking home or standing in line for coffee, when whipping out a book 
might be the perfect way to 
kill some time.
Read fiction, read non-
fiction, read any book you want. It can be as fantastical as The Hunger Games, as so-phisticated as James Joyce, or as trashy as Fifty Shades of 
Grey — if that’s what you’re 
into. Just read something.
In today’s technologically 
advanced society, where glo-balization and the Internet 
have caused us to be constant-
ly connected, easy distractions such as YouTube and Twitter lie at our fingertips.
These social-media outlets 
are wonderful, full of dreams and possibilities and some-times just a much-needed laugh. Unfortunately, many 
people have forgotten books 
have the exact same possibili-ties held within their pages. The ability of human beings 
to create words, sentences 
and stories and mark them on paper is a precious gift and is the basis for all other forms of learning and entertainment, 
from history books to song 
lyrics.
The National Center for 
Education Statistics reported 
in 2003 that about 30 million 
U.S. adults read written prose at a “below basic” level. This means that 14 percent of the U.S. adult population is un-
able to meaningfully compre-
hend basic prose writing. The Center also found that more than 60 percent of U.S. prison 
inmates are functionally il-
literate.  Even in a country as advanced and developed as the U.S., reading is becoming a lost art among large seg-
ments of the population. The 
U.S. must put more empha-sis on early literacy educa-tion and must acknowledge 
and respect the opportunities 
reading provides.
As students at one of the 
nation’s top public universi-ties, Gators should especially 
understand and appreciate 
the importance of reading. We should do what we can to help promote literacy and 
remind ourselves of the ways 
that reading expands our ho-rizons and our imaginations. We don’t have to make a huge commitment, but we can start 
today.
Today, we can pick up a 
book.

opinions@alligator.orgThe life of NFL star Ray Rice has 
been unfolding in the public eye after surveillance camera footage 
was released by TMZ of Rice assaulting his then-fiancee Janay Rice.
 The Rices’ situation has caused a lot of controversy 
but has also brought attention to an issue that is often 
overlooked: domestic violence.
Domestic violence is a recurring issue with some 
big public figures and impacts the lives of many 
Americans. The Rice incident, while bringing atten-tion to the severity of domestic violence, has caused 
some people to become insensitive to the serious-
ness of this issue.
Rice was originally sentenced to a two-game sus-
pension after the incident was reported to officials in March. After the video was released by TMZ, 
Rice was immediately removed from the Baltimore Ravens’ roster and dropped from all commercial 
endorsements.
Several fans were upset about Rice undergoing 
double jeopardy punishment for the same incident. This anger has caused some to think his off-the-field 
behavior is acceptable.
Rice’s second suspension caused so much out-
rage that “Ray Rice” was trending on social me-
dia for three consecutive days. The video footage 
sparked debate on almost every daytime talk show 
and news channel.
It is unfair for the NFL to suspend someone 
twice for the same situation, but the reality is Rice’s surveillance video could not be overlooked. The in-
cident has exposed the NFL’s poor policies and its 
inattention to women’s issues.
The NFL should pay more attention to the poli-
cies it has in place. The fact that prior to this in-cident there was only a two-game suspension for players arrested for domestic violence is just sad. It 
should not have taken this incident for the NFL to 
change the policy.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell should have 
stuck by his poor decision of the two-game suspen-sion. 
Even though it is a bad policy, Goodell chang-
ing his decision has brought even more attention to the incident and caused many to question NFL policies.
Rice’s wife Janay has been under a lot 
of scrutiny because not only is she stay-
ing with Rice, but she is also defending 
him. Many media outlets and fans have 
slandered her online.
According to safehorizon.org, 1 in 4 women will 
experience domestic violence during her lifetime. Unfortunately, the majority of these incidents will never get reported.
Furthermore, the National Coalition Against Do-
mestic Violence reported that almost one-third of 
female homicide victims reported in police records 
are killed by an intimate partner.
Since this public incident has occurred, more 
people are reporting domestic violence cases, and 
domestic violence help center hotlines’ telephones 
have been constantly ringing.
This is an improvement over the usual silence 
that victims keep rather than speaking up. 
Domestic violence is often overlooked because so 
many people feel too embarrassed or humiliated. 
Victims should be protected and not be fearful of 
the judgment they might face from others.
Domestic violence is not acceptable and should 
not be tolerated. 
It doesn’t matter how great of a player Rice may 
be; he is a human being and should be held account-able for his actions.
Rice should use his mistake and influence with 
youth to help educate them to manage themselves when upset. 
He could become an advocate for so many young 
men and women with violent tendencies. 
His football career may be over, but his life will 
continue, and with it he should try to make some-thing positive from this situation.
There are many domestic violence victims all 
over the world, and this issue should be discussed 
more. 
Don’t be afraid to speak up for your loved ones 
or friends who are in abusive situations; it could 
make a difference.

Strike Up the Band

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
KIEV, Ukraine — Both govern-
ment troops and pro-Russian rebels 
began withdrawing heavy artillery in the east of the country, Ukrainian officials said Monday, a significant 
step toward implementing an effec-
tive cease-fire in the region.
Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman 
for Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said Kiev’s forces had started withdrawing from front-line positions. He said the rebels had also begun their withdrawal of heavy artillery, although it was “not 
as massive as we expected.”
“We are seeing a trend that (the 
rebels) are reducing their use of heavy armed weaponry,” Lysenko 
told journalists in Kiev. He said nei-ther Kiev nor the rebels had com-pleted their withdrawals, but said 
he hoped the rebels “will follow the 
example of the Ukrainian service-men.”
A cease-fire imposed Sept. 5 has 
been riddled by violations from the start, adding civilian casualties to the estimated 3,000 people who have been killed since the conflict began in April.
On Monday, explosions were 
heard north of the rebel-held city of Donetsk, where fighting in recent weeks centered on a government-held airport has caught many resi-dential areas in the crossfire. Later, smoke rose over a neighborhood in that area and rebels blocked an As-sociated Press photographer from traveling there.
Lysenko said two Ukrainian ser-
vicemen had been killed in the past 
day.
Ukraine, Russia and the Mos-
cow-backed rebels last week signed 
an agreement to further the peace 
process by halting advances and 
pulling back heavy artillery, creat-ing a buffer zone between them.The deal, supported by the Orga-
nization for Security and Coopera-tion in Europe, also specifically bans flights by combat aircraft over the area of conflict and setting up new minefields.
It could be a significant step for-
ward in finally bringing an end to 
the simmering conflict, although ne-
gotiators have not yet addressed the future status of the rebel regions, the most politically controversial issue.
In an interview with Ukrainian 
news channels released late Sunday, Ukrainian president Petro Porosh-enko pleaded with the public to give the peace deal time to work.
“Solving the war in Luhansk and 
Donetsk with military alone is im-possible,” he said. “The more mili-tary groups we have there, the more the Russian army will send.”
Poroshenko said 65 percent of military equipment deployed by Kiev in the east has been destroyed. During a trip to the U.S. last week, the Ukrainian president pleaded for lethal weapons for his country’s army. The U.S. gave Poroshenko $46 million in security aid, but excluded lethal weapons from the deal.
Poland’s Defense Minister 
Tomasz Siemoniak on Monday con-firmed that Poland is ready to sell arms to Ukraine.
“Since July, there is no embargo 
on arms sale to Ukraine,” he said in an interview with the radio station Zet, adding that Poland and “many other countries” are prepared to of-
fer their products.
Siemoniak said that Ukraine is 
now getting acquainted with the list 
of armaments made in Poland, but the two countries have agreed not to discuss the details publicly.

A record-high percentage of 
Americans are concerned about 
rising Islamic extremism in the 
U.S., and UF political science pro-
fessor Richard Nolan said Ameri-cans have a legitimate reason for this concern.
“I think the level of anxiety is 
premised on a great deal of uncer-tainty about how to deal with it or, in a sense, what it means in the long run,” Nolan said.
About 53 percent of polled 
Americans are concerned about the rise of extremism in the U.S., a new Pew Research Center study 
showed. The survey also found 62 
percent of polled Americans are concerned about the global rise of Islamic extremism, the largest per-centage since 2007.
Nolan compared the Islamic 
State — which recently broadcast-ed the execution of two American 
journalists and one British foreign 
aid worker — to the terrorist group al-Qaida. He said the Islamic State has given “sanctuary” to other ter-ror exploits and plans to expand 
across larger regions. 
“Like al-Qaida had that shelter-
ing in Afghanistan, it’s possible 
that (ISIS) could form some kind of 
haven and provide that same kind 
of protection for other groups,” Nolan said. 
UF political science chair Ido 
Oren acknowledged rising Ameri-
can concern but said he doesn’t see 
Islamic extremist groups as much of a threat to Americans.  
“It is not zero,” Oren said. “It is not completely insignificant, but not nearly, in my assessment, as severe as it might be interpreted based on these poll numbers.”
He believes the biggest Ameri-
can threats are U.S. citizens and European Muslims who travel to the Middle East and join such groups. But he doesn’t predict ex-
tremism reaching the U.S. 
“It is beyond far-fetched,” Oren 
said. 
Sirah Mora, a 20-year-old UF 
international studies junior with 
a Middle-Eastern focus, said she believes there is a reason to be con-cerned, especially because the U.S. is already trying to subdue those 
groups. 
“The more we’re involved, I 
think, the more it’s a threat here,” 
Mora said.Study: concern toward ISIS grows

Book lovers may be sur-
prised to find their favorite 
books are banned.  
The George A. Smathers 
Libraries will celebrate these 
books during national Banned 
Books Week on Thursday on the Plaza of the Americas.
Banned Books Week is a cel-
ebration of the freedom to read and the open access of informa-tion. This is the second time the Smathers Libraries will host the event on the plaza lawn, Li-
brary West circulation services 
coordinator Michele Lesure said. 
Lesure said about 30 people 
participated in the event last year and she expects twice as many to attend the reading event. 
At the event, Patrick Reakes, 
the associate dean of scholarly resources and services, will read a proclamation of the Smathers Libraries participa-tion in Banned Books Week.  Dean of university libraries Judith Russell will start off the event by reading “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee. 
Students, faculty and staff are 
invited to read segments from their favorite banned books.
The event will take place 
from noon to 1 p.m., and free pizza and soda will be provid-ed. 
Every year, hundreds of 
books are challenged to be 
banned by any “concerned citi-
zen,” Lesure said. 
“I believe that all books 
should be easily accessible,” Le-sure said. “We need to grow at-tention and bring awareness to the fact that there are precious documents that should be open to all readers.”
Lesure said it is not fair for a 
book to be banned from every-one when it should be the par-
ents’ job to censor what their 
children should and should not be reading.
Brooke Alexander, a 19-year-
old biology sophomore, said she appreciates that UF is host-ing this event. 
“Books are a source of free-
dom,” Alexander said. “They 
are a use of expression and 
should be obtainable on a cam-pus where students are learn-ing.”
Jaime Bell, a 20-year-old 
health science junior, said she loved reading “To Kill a Mock-ingbird” in high school. But Bell was shocked to find out 
that books like “To Kill a Mock-
ingbird” are challenged and banned each year.
“People should be afforded 
different opinions, and we should be able to read what-ever we want,” Bell said.Libraries to honor

MIDLAND, Texas — An Iraq war veter-
an accused of scaling a fence and making it 
into the White House before the Secret Ser-
vice stopped him owns several guns that 
he could have brought with him if he had meant to harm anyone, his former stepson said Sunday.
Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested Fri-
day and is expected in federal court Mon-day to face charges of unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while car-rying a deadly or dangerous weapon — a 
small folding knife in this case.
Jerry Murphy, whose mother was mar-
ried to Gonzalez for several years, said 
Gonzalez suffers from post-traumatic 
stress disorder and he needs treatment, 
not to be treated like a criminal. 
“I know he’s got heavy artillery, you 
know? He’s got all kinds of weapons, and he was trained to use them,” Murphy said. 
“I believe if he wanted to make a scene or 
cause problems, he very well could have. But it’s clear that he didn’t.”
The Army said Gonzalez enlisted in 
July 1997 and remained until completing his service obligation in September 2003. He re-enlisted in July 2005 and served un-til his retirement in late 2012.
Samantha Bell, who is Gonzalez’s ex-
wife and Murphy’s mother, said Gonza-lez was honorably discharged for medical reasons and suffered from plantar fasciitis on his feet, on which he had had some sur-
geries. She said he also suffered from PTSD, 
for which he had been prescribed several 
medications.
She said Gonzalez kept the blinds drawn 
and would repeatedly go downstairs dur-ing the night to make sure the doors were locked and the oven was off. 
She said she once woke up in the mid-
dle of the night to find Gonzalez standing at the foot of the bed and staring at her. She said he told her he was simply watch-ing her sleep.
“It was really odd, and I didn’t know 
how to take that,” she said. “I just couldn’t deal with it. I didn’t want to deal with it, I couldn’t — that’s the whole reason I left. 
He was so paranoid he was starting to 
make me paranoid.”
Less than 24 hours after Gonzalez’s ar-
rest, a second man was apprehended after he drove up to a White House gate and re-
fused to leave, Secret Service spokesman 
Ed Donovan said, prompting bomb tech-nicians in full gear to search the vehicle as agents briefly shut down nearby streets.
There were no indications the two in-
cidents were connected. But they only in-tensified the scrutiny of the Secret Service.TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — NASA’s Mars Atmo-
sphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (Maven) spacecraft 
arrived at Mars late Sunday after a 442 million-mile jour-
ney that began nearly a year ago.
The explorer fired its brakes and successfully slipped 
into orbit around the red planet, officials confirmed.
Flight controllers in Colorado will spend the next six weeks adjusting Maven’s altitude, checking its instru-
ments and observing a comet streaking by.
Then in early November, Maven will start probing the 
upper atmosphere of Mars. The spacecraft will conduct its observations from orbit; it’s not meant to land.
Scientists believe the Martian atmosphere holds clues 
as to how Earth’s neighbor went from being warm and wet billions of years ago to cold and dry. That early wet world may have harbored microbial life.NASA launched Maven last November from Cape Ca-
naveral, the 10th U.S. mission sent to orbit the red plan-et. Three earlier ones failed, and until the official word came of success late Sunday night, the entire team was 
on edge.
The spacecraft was clocking more than 10,000 mph 
when it hit the brakes for the so-called orbital insertion, 
a half-hour process. On Sunday, the world had to wait 12 minutes to learn the outcome because of the lag in space-
craft signals, given the 138 million miles between the two 
planets.
Maven will spend at least a year collecting data.NASA’s Maven explorer arrives at Mars after a year of travel 
It will collect data while orbiting the planetTUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2014

UF coach Mary Wise calls out a play to her team during Florida’s 3-2 win against Oklahoma on Aug. 30 in the O’Connell Center. The Gators ﬁ  nished its non-conference slate with a 6-3 record and begins SEC play against Auburn on Friday.

Coach Mary Wise’s central theme this season has 
been the Gators’ potential for growth.
And so far, No. 10 Florida has grown. 
Through nine matches, freshman Rhamat Alhassan 
leads the Southeastern Conference in hitting percent-
age (.510), second-year transfer Mackenzie Dagostino is second in service aces (0.46/set) and third in assists 
(11.06/set), and sophomore Alex Holston is eighth in 
kills (3.31/set). 
Holly Pole and Simone Antwi also reside in the top 
15 of the SEC’s statistical categories for digs and kills, respectively. 
After defeating UCF in four sets on Sunday, the UF 
squad feels like it’s in good standing.
“Looking at the ﬁ  rst segment of our 2014 schedule, 
to be 6-3 after the quality of opponents we’ve played, we’re real pleased where we are,” coach Mary Wise said.
Florida will begin conference play on Friday, where 
it will match up against Auburn in the ﬁ  rst of two meetings with the Tigers.
“Now, going into the SEC schedule, now we’re all 
0-0… what we’ve talked to the team about is how can UF volleyball continuing to grow as non-conference play ﬁ  nishes
“But the improvement our team has made 
over the past month… I think it shows the 
resiliency of this group.”

After a sixth-straight road game 
Friday night in Alabama, Florida is happy to be home.
Although the Gators went 4-2 dur-
ing their time away from Gainesville, coach Becky Burleigh said the team is ready to ﬁ  nally play in front of a 
home crowd again.
“Hallelujah,” she said. 
“We’re really excited to be at 
home. I think that it’s been a really long time and I know our team will 
be up for it.”
A full week at home also means a 
full week of practice, something the 
team has not had because of the busy 
travel schedule. 
With no Sunday game played this past weekend either, Burleigh said 
she hopes to see the team use the whole week to make improvements.
“I just think there’s a couple 
things — we’re playing kinda two 
main systems, and to be able to ﬁ  ne 
tune those a little 
bit, it would be 
really helpful,” she said, “and that just takes a little bit of time which we haven’t really had being on the road 
so much.”
Chemistry between players and 
set pieces were also aspects Burleigh 
mentioned wanting to work on this 
week, especially for teams that like 
to pack in their defenses and make it hard to score.
One such team was Alabama, Gators conclude road trip, 
prepare for home matchesJOHNSON’S JOURNAL
It’s OK to change one’s opin-
ion based upon the gather-ing of new information.
After Florida’s opener 
against Eastern Michigan, I re-ceived a text from a close friend that read, “Jeff looked good, but 
man Treon....” 
Freshman quarterback Treon 
Harris had just thrown for a 
quaint 148 yards and two touchdowns on just two passes. A sneaky good 100 percent 
completion percentage in the ﬁ  rst game of 
his career isn’t bad, even if it is in garbage time.
I wrote it off as knee-jerk (with the added 
prior knowledge that she isn’t much of a fan of Driskel to begin with).
Understanding what she was getting at, 
I sent back “No Treon Harris is not starting. Stop it.” She clariﬁ  ed “not right away, but 
when Jeff drops the ball eventually….” 
It would appear that Driskel has done 
just that, because I’m ready for a changing 
of the guard under center, and depending 
on if you’re a conspiracy theorist, Florida’s best receiver is too — Demar-
cus Robinson brieﬂ  y retweeted a pro-Harris tweet Sunday be-
fore undoing the action.
Driskel looked OK in that 
Eastern Michigan game. 
He looked just OK in the 
triple-overtime win against 
Kentucky. 
The problem is he’s looked 
just OK most of his career at Florida. 
I think you can win with OK, but you’ve 
got to have a better offense than it appears the Gators have, a dominant defense to tote the mail and a good bit of luck.
Florida struck the lucky pot of gold for 
two quarters Saturday against Alabama and then the well ran dry after ‘Bama’s fourth and ﬁ  nal turnover of the day. 
For the third week in a row, Driskel 
missed deep receivers and stared down oth-
ers. He was not-so-smooth with the zone 
read and balls were inexplicably thrown at receivers’ feet. If not for three drives start-ed by turnovers, Florida’s offensive output Muschamp should start TreonSEE VOLLEY, PAGE 14

112 total voteswe improve from the end of 
September to the end of No-vember.” Wise said. “But the 
improvement our team has 
made over the past month … I think it shows the resiliency of this group.”
But as resilient as this Flor-
ida team appears to be, it still must improve drastically in one area.
The Gators lead all teams 
also ranked in the top-10 in service errors with 115. In fact, if No. 1 Stanford, No. 2 Texas, No. 5 Wisconsin, No. 6 
FSU and No. 8 Nebraska each 
amassed 39 service errors against their next opponent, Florida would still lead all of them.
Most of that is the result 
of elite level volleyball, but the trend should at the very least be an area of concern for 
Florida, especially if it views 
itself on the same echelon as the other top-10 teams.
“Nothing bad usually hap-
pens if you hit the ball hard, 
and we like the arm speed. 
That’s a good thing,” Wise said. “You’re gonna get some errors, just like jump serv-
ing.”
Florida’s serving philoso-
phy is simple: It lives by it, 
and it dies by it.
“We’re definitely an ag-
gressive serving team, and (errors) are always going to happen when you serve ag-gressive,” sophomore Alex Holston said after UF’s 3-2 loss to FSU, in which Florida 
recorded 20 service errors.
Holston has one of the 
strongest arms in the SEC, and 
isn’t timid at the service line. 
As a result, she has played ex-
ceptionally well this season, 
and leads UF with 116 kills. 
She also leads the team 
with 25 service errors.
Florida views the benefits 
of its serving style as far out-
weighing its disadvantages. And for the most part this sea-
son, they have. 
The Gators have just two 
losses in four matches against 
teams ranked in the top-15, and they defeated then-No. 
15 San Diego and then-No. 6 
USC on the road.
Still, the common denomi-
nator in each of UF’s three 
losses has been service errors 
– it owns a 47-33 advantage in that category.
If there is a flaw to be found 
in Florida’s mostly positive start to the 2014 campaign, it has been its service errors. But until the errors start to have 
a major affect on Florida’s 
record – which so far they haven’t – don’t expect Wise and the Gators to make many 
adjustments.
“You’ve got to live with the 
errors,” Wise said. “Because 
when you bring the heat, some good things happen.”would have been only 128 yards. 
Jeff Driskel is what he is. I think 
it’s time to at least give Treon Har-ris the start at Tennessee.
Sure he can be on a short leash, 
with Driskel waiting in the wings 
if it doesn’t go well. 
And please don’t give me the 
“hostile environment” excuse. 
A nooner at Neyland Stadium is about as hostile as a box full of kit-
tens. 
You don’t get experience 
against adversity until you actu-
ally get experience against the ad-
versity —  maybe I’m being a bit 
overzealous, but if I were offen-sive coordinator Kurt Roper, I’d be itching to throw Harris into the fire to see how he could do.
Will Muschamp thinks Jeff 
Driskel gives this team the best chance to win. 
At this point, I’m just not sure. So let’s find out. Muschamp cares about guys 
who have seen live bullets, which I understand, but at this point 
what does he have to lose? 
The known quantity in Driskel 
isn’t doing anything substantial 
over a replacement level quarter-
back.
Harris arrived on campus in 
the summer and was still able to 
beat out freshman Will Grier, who had an entire spring practice to 
grasp Roper’s new playbook.
 The major knock against Har-
ris in Muschamp’s mind, I bet, is 
that UF can’t run everything it wants to with him over Driskel. 
That’s understandable es-
pecially since he’s a freshman, but this bye week would be best 
served trying to further develop 
packages to use Harris as much as possible. 
If it’s not an outright usurpa-
tion of the job, or a reopening of 
the quarterback competition like 
I’m alluding to at least let him ac-tually get on the field. 
The third quarter against Ala-
bama may have not have been an awesome time to get Harris game-reps, overtime against Kentucky isn’t ideal either. But after two weeks of practice with — hope-
fully — a good amount of first-
team reps, what’s stopping you from giving Harris some run on Rocky Top?
which Florida defeated Friday night 2-1 for the first time in Tuscaloosa, Ala., since 2008.
The Gators were finally able to crack 
the Tide’s defense in the 74th minute from 
a Liz Slattery goal and the 77th minute 
from a Lauren Silver goal. Slattery’s was her first goal of the season, and for Silver, it was the senior’s first since her freshman 
year.
“It’s great to get goals from unlikely 
sources, it’s good for our team for that,” 
Burleigh said.
“But for both of them I think that it’s 
good to see that the time they’ve put into executing some of the things that they wanted to be better at has paid off.”
Florida promptly allowed an Alabama 
goal in the 78th minute to let the Tide back into the game, but was able to hold on for the victory. Burleigh said she liked how the team was able to win that style of game, one it wasn’t used to playing.
“We did a pretty good job, I think, of 
keeping possession of the ball, getting our 
opportunities and getting kind of scrappy 
goals, which is a little different than we normal score,” she said. “So it was kinda good for us to see us be able to score on some set pieces, that’s something we’ve 
kinda put some emphasis on in prac-
tice…”
Although Burleigh was not pleased 
Florida allowed Alabama to make a goal 
quickly after Florida scored, she called the 
mistake “a great learning experience” that can be used to prevent the same thing from happening later on in the season.
The first opportunity to do so will be 
this weekend when Florida hosts rival Georgia on Friday night. Burleigh said this year’s contest should be tougher than last year’s 5-1 score indicated.
“We know they’re gonna be a handful,” 
Burleigh said, “and I think they’re play-ing some really, really good soccer right now.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2014

With three weeks worth of 
games in the books for the 2014-
2015 NFL season, more and more rookie and veteran Gators alike are finding their footing. 
But some are losing out on that 
opportunity before it could even really begin. 
Twelve Gators combined for 
more than 50 tackles this past week. Miami Dolphins linebacker Jelani Jenkins contributed greatly to the efforts with a career-high 15 tack-les. Jenkins had set his previous 
career-high of 14 tackles against 
the Buffalo Bills on Sept. 14. 
“It was just a blitz up the mid-
dle,” Jenkins said of a tackle en-abling the Dolphins to come with-in six points of the Chiefs. “They kind of had me blocked, and I just kind of kept running my feet and the quarterback was right there. I 
think everybody else did a great 
job around me. It was a team ef-fort.”
 But Jenkins’ efforts were not 
enough to secure a win. The Kan-sas City Chiefs defeated the Dol-phins 34-15. Both teams now hold a 1-2 record.
On the other side of the field, 
Kansas City wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. returned five punts for 100 yards. 
“He probably should have let 
a couple of those go,” Kansas City coach Andy Reid said. “The flavor of the day, though, is that you are returning everything. Studies show that there’s production there.” 
Fellow Chief and former Gator 
defensive tackle Jaye Howard had one quarterback hit. Bengals defensive end Carlos 
Dunlap notched six tackles and a sack in Cincinnati 33-7 win against 
the Tennessee Titans. Safety Reg-
gie Nelson also totaled six tackles plus one interception and one pass defended. The Bengals are the only team left undefeated in the AFC. In the NFC, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Arizona Cardinals remain 
undefeated. 
Though tight end Trey Burton 
had only one tackle and corner-
back Jaylen Watkins was inactive for the game, the Eagles defeated the Washington Redskins 37-34. Former Gator wide receiver and 
current Eagle Riley Cooper record-
ed four receptions for 34 yard son seven targets. 
Continuing on the tackling train, Cleveland’s cornerback Joe Haden also recorded six, five of which were solo tackles. 
“Joe Haden is as good as there 
is,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said to the Baltimore Sun. “We’ve played him every year, and I don’t hear a lot about him, except for the fact (that) when I watch him play, he speaks volumes in terms of the way he plays. If you want an eval-uation, he’s quick, he’s athletic, he 
has ball skills. He’s a stick-to-you 
cover corner.” 
Though, like in the case with 
Miami, Haden’s efforts were not enough to power the Browns to a win. The Baltimore Ravens defeat-ed the Browns 23-21. 
Broncos Down: Former Gators 
wide receiver Andre Caldwell and 
linebacker Lerentee McCray did 
not make an impact in Denver’s 26-20 overtime loss to reigning NFL champion Seattle Seahawks.  Caldwell did not record any stats and McCray did not play due to a sprained knee. 
Inactivate Impact: Three former 
Gators failed to record any stats on the field this week. Highly touted rookie defensive end Dominique 
Easley failed to record any stats 
in the New England Patriots’ 16-9 win over the Oakland Raiders. 
Former Gator and current 
St. Louis cornerback Marcus Roberson didn’t make an impact for the Rams in their 34-31 loss to 
the Houston Texans. 
Lastly, New Orleans linebacker 
Ronald Powell didn’t make any 
statistical impact on Sunday. 
But the Saints managed a 20-9 
win against the Minnesota Vi-kings.� CLEMSON LOST TO FLORIDA STATE 
IN OVERTIME.
MORGAN MORIARTY
Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
A Jameis Winston-less No. 1 Florida 
State team beat Atlantic Coast Conference  
rival Clemson on Saturday, and much of 
that was because Clemson is always going 
to “Clemson.” 
The art of “Clemsoning” simply means 
losing a football game that should have 
been won. “Clemsoning” can be done by 
committing a costly turnover late in the game or calling a not-so-smart play in cer-tain field situations. 
The latter occurred on Saturday when 
the Tigers forced the Seminoles into over-time at Doak Campbell Stadium and sat at 4th-and-1 from the FSU 16 yard line.
If you are Clemson, the logical play call 
would be to just run it up the middle to get the first down, right? 
But instead, offensive coordinator Carl 
Franks called a run play, but placed Tigers quarterback Deshaun Watson in the shot-
gun to hand the ball off to tailback Adam 
Choice. The play resulted in no gain, and FSU took over on downs, while Karlos Williams rushed for a 12-yard touchdown on first down.
Game over, with a final score of 23-17. Clemson just “Clemsoned.”SEC West Update: The loaded South-
eastern Conference Western Division — which heads into Week 5 with four teams 
ranked in the AP Top 25 poll — continued 
its dominance with No. 5 Auburn getting past a scrappy Kansas State team on the road on Thursday night, No. 3 Alabama 
rolling over Florida 42-21 and No. 6 Texas 
A&M dismantling SMU 58-6 in Dallas. 
Fans saw the first upset within the divi-
sion on Saturday as Mississippi State went into Death Valley and defeated then-No. 8 
LSU 34-29. The Bulldogs have not won in 
Baton Rouge since 1991. 
Mississippi State quarterback Dak 
Prescott had his breakout game, throwing 
for 268 yards and rushing for another 198. 
The Bulldogs were unranked in the AP 
last week and jumped to No. 14 after the 
upset. 
Don’t sleep on Arkansas this season, 
either — its 52-14 victory over Northern Il-linois snapped the Huskies’ 17-game road winning streak. Not to mention Arkansas’ Alex Collins is averaging 123 yards on the 
ground per game.No Top-5 Upset Yet: It is week five 
and a member of the AP Top 5 has yet to go down, although a couple teams came 
close. 
No. 4 Oklahoma pulled away in Mor-
gantown, W. Va., in the second half against West Virginia to take a 45-33 win, high-lighted by tailback Samaje Perine scoring the Sooners’ final three touchdowns. 
No. 3 Oregon squeaked by Mike Leach 
and Washington State on the road, winning only by a touchdown thrown by quarter-back Marcus Mariota late in the fourth. TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Elliott Orkin ended Florida’s first 
home tournament of the fall un-
scathed.
The UF sophomore took the sin-
gles title at the Southeastern Confer-
ence Fall Classic on Monday after 
defeating teammate Diego Hidalgo in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6 (7) at the Ring Tennis Complex.
Orkin did not drop a set through-
out the tournament, going 5-0 dur-ing the four-day event and dropping just 22 games in his 10 sets.
Florida’s success as a team at the 
SEC Fall Classic was noticed from the start, with five Gators advancing through the first round.
UF went on to monopolize the 
singles bracket heading into Mon-day, with Florida’s Gordon Watson, Maxx Lipman, Hidalgo and Orkin holding all four spots in the semifi-nals. 
Those four combined to drop just 
three sets heading into Monday.
“I’ve actually never had to play 
one of my teammates in a tourna-ment before, but if we have to play each other that’s a good thing,” Orkin said in a release Sunday. “It means we’re doing well and moving in the right direction as a team.”
But Orkin was not the only Flori-
da player to win a title.
UF freshman Jordan Belga, who 
fell to South Carolina’s Kyle Koch in the first round of main-draw singles play, won the consolation bracket on 
Sunday after de-feating Vander-bilt’s Kris Yee 5-7, 6-3, 10-7 in 
the semifinals. Belga won the finals against Ole Miss’ Ricardo Jorge by default after the Rebels left the tour-nament early.
“I got more confidence from the 
other guys when they were starting to progress throughout the tourna-ment,” Belga said in a release. “They were really pushing the standard and I felt like I had to up my stan-dard, so it really gave me a boost of confidence with the team and with my game as well.”
Watson and Hidalgo clinched 
the doubles title after taking an 8-2 win against South Carolina’s Thom-as Two other Florida duos — Orkin and Lipman as well as Josh Wardell and Oliver Landert — advanced to the quarterfinals of the doubles draw.16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2014

Lauren Embree is one step away from ad-
vancing to the main draw at the Red Rock Pro 
Open 50k.
The former Gators All-American won her 
second-round match in the qualifying bracket on Monday, defeating Romania’s Cristina-Madalina Stancu 6-4, 6-2. Embree has not dropped a set through 
her first two matches and has given up just 
10 games throughout the four sets she has 
played so far.
Embree will face Ukraine’s Kateryna Bond-
arenko today in the qualifying round finals.
If Embree wins the match, the 22-year-old 
will be one of four players to proceed to the tournament’s main draw.
While the former UF standout advanced on Monday, Florida’s Bri-
anna Morgan’s did not.
The UF junior — Flor-
ida’s lone member on its 
2014 roster competing in Las Vegas — fell in her 
second-round qualifying match to Bondarenko in straight sets, 6-0, 6-2.
Morgan struggled mightily in her matchup 
against Bondarenko, winning just one service game compared to Bondarenko’s six. 
Morgan scored just 17 points when she was on the serve.
With Morgan eliminated from play, the 
Gators look ahead to their next tournament of the fall — the 2014 Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships, which begins on Saturday and lasts until Oct. 5 in Pacific 
Palisades, Calif. 
Last season, Morgan and then-senior Sofie 
Oyen lost in the first set of the main draw.
