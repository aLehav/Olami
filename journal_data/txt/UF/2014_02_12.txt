There’s a new set of French fries on 
campus.
On Tuesday, the Samuel P. Harn Mu-
seum of Art began the permanent installa-
tion of “Big Max,” a 33-foot-tall sculpture 
designed by John Raymond Henry. The red-painted sculpture consists of roughly 
30,000 pounds of steel and a central beam resting on two intersecting beams.
Henry, who designed “Alachua,” the 
sculpture nicknamed “the French Fries” by UF students, said it took him roughly 
20 years to complete the three-beam sculp-
ture because of various roadblocks and the completion of other projects.“When you’re building a piece that’s 
not commissioned for a speciﬁ  c site, you don’t have to rush,” he said. “You reach a 
point where you don’t know where to go 
with it, and you just let it sit. There’s no reason to push it.”
The piece is named for Henry’s grand-
son, a premature baby who weighed a pound and a half at birth and is now a 24-year-old student studying ﬁ  lm in Cali-fornia.

A local startup company is putting a new 
spin on traditional fundraising methods.
Spin Chill, founded by UF student Trevor 
Abbott and UF alumnus Ty Parker, has en-
tered the second FedEx Small Business Grant 
Contest to compete for the grand prize of 
$25,000. The company produces handheld devices 
that can cool a warm drink in 30 to 60 sec-onds by spinning it in a cooler of ice.FedEx spokeswoman Katie Wassmer said 
she thinks the FedEx grant competition is a great learning experience for entrepreneur-ial-minded students.
“I think students who participate can 
learn more about what it takes to be a small-
business owner, what it takes to go after 
their dreams and what it takes to reach their goals,” Wassmer said.
Anyone can vote once a day until Feb. 23, and FedEx will announce the 100 businesses with the most votes on Feb. 26. 
Abbott, 21, and Parker, 24, are no strang-
ers to unorthodox fundraising methods after raising $40,000 in 30 days with Kickstarter.
With the Kickstarter crowdfunding, they 
were able take their handheld model from the prototype stage to today’s ﬁ  nal product.
If the pair wins the grant, Abbott said they Spin Chill startup competes for $25K, wants to expand productsFrench fry sculpture gets new cousin

Despite more than three months of plan-
ning, the Freshman Leadership Council can-
celed the Student Government Debate.
The FLC has hosted the annual debate 
since 2006. However, because only Swamp 
Party has a full qualifying ticket this year, the 
debate will not happen.
Maria Galindo, the council’s vice chair 
woman of public relations, said the debate is a long-standing tradition.
“The event was designed to provide an 
environment for the executive tickets to argue their platforms in an unbiased setting,” she wrote in an email.
Still, Galindo said she believes each party 
will compensate for the debate cancellation.
“While in the past the debate has served 
as an outlet for the executive candidates from each party to communicate their platform,” she said, “I am conﬁ  dent that in light of the circumstances the leaders from each party will make use of alternative methods, like social media, to communicate their message to the 
Student Body.”
Stephanie Kreitzer, former presidential 
candidate for the Taco Libre Party, said she is 
disappointed with the decision to cancel the debate.
“I think it’s a shame to cancel a tradition 
that FLC and Student Government has had for years,” she said. “I think an election without a debate is a disservice to students in the uni-
versity. They should be able to hear from both 
sides to make an informed decision.”
Susan Webster, the Swamp Party spokes-
woman, said the party still wants to debate, but it plans to address student questions via a Candidate

The Gainesville Public Works Department 
has begun modifying some intersections to 
make navigating roads easier for local bikers.
A bike box was painted at the intersection of 
Southwest Second Avenue and Southwest 13th Street due to the high volume of cyclists. City public works planning manager Debbie Leist-
ner wrote in an email that a bike box — a space 
between the crosswalk and where trafﬁ  c stops — gives bikers a safe space to wait for the light to change and a chance to turn before cars.
Leistner said a total of $29,000 was spent on 
materials and supplies for the project, which includes the box and a bike boulevard along West 12th Street from Southwest 8th Avenue to Northwest 19th Lane. The boulevard will include green markings, reduced speed limits and street signs.
Other bike boulevards are planned along 
North Third Avenue and North Fifth Avenue 
as well as East Seventh Street.
“The bike box makes cyclists more visible, 
increasing driver awareness and providing 
a staging area for cyclists to have a head start 
at the intersection, especially when turning,” 
Leistner said.
The bike box and boulevard feature bike 
detection systems that can help trafﬁ  c lights change to reduce delays for cyclists. 
Zack Carter, a 19-year-old UF health science 
freshman, said he is looking forward to the con-venience. 
“The biggest advantage will be the light 
change,” he said. “Normally if a biker gets to the light, the light won’t detect that it needs to turn.”WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

TAMPA — Florida Highway Patrol troopers say they’re 
trying to determine what entrance a driver took on Inter-
state 275 to end up going the wrong way and crashing into a car carrying four University of South Florida students.
All ﬁ  ve died in the Sunday morning crash.
The crash claimed the lives of Jobin Joy Kuriakose, 21, 
of Orlando, Ankeet Harshad Patel, 22, of Melbourne, Im-
tiyaz Ilias, 20, of Fort Myers, Dammie Yesudhas, 21, of Melbourne and the driver of the 2001 Ford Expedition that crashed head-on into them.
Toxicology tests, which will determine if the drivers 
were impaired, also take six to eight weeks, Florida High-way Patrol Sgt. Steve Gaskins said.
Investigators are also piecing together the wrong-way driver’s route.
“We do not know where he came on the interstate,” 
Gaskins said. “He may have turned around in the median. We can say with some level of certainty that he was going 
the wrong way for at least a mile or two.”
Video feeds from interstate entrance and exit ramps do 
not record, he said. 
They are for observing real-time trafﬁ  c conditions 
only, so trafﬁ  c homicide investigators don’t have video-
tape from the highway cameras to watch.The four students were all members of USF’s Sigma 
Beta Rho fraternity. A call for donations for the families of the students raised nearly $50,000 in just two days.
The fraternity will hold a remembrance ceremony on 
Thursday at USF.
A donation site, set up by Sigma Beta Rho national 
president Mohsin “Rhythmk” Hussain, saw a steady stream of donations offered, from $5 up to single dona-tions of up to hundreds of dollars.
“It is unimaginable what the families must be going 
through right now,” said the message on the donation website. “As we all work through this difﬁ  cult time, it is important for us to come together and form a support net 
for the family. We are asking all of our family, friends, 
Greek community members, and associates help by do-nating as much as they can.” Tampa crash that killed four USF students under investigation

Florida Highway Patrol seargent “I was building this big 
piece, and his name was Max 
— Maxwell,” Henry said. “So I just called it Big Max, and I nicknamed him Big Max.”
Construction of the sculp-
ture, which previously toured seven cities in Florida, began at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday and finished in the early evening. The sculp-ture will receive paint touch-ups and a final cleaning before its completion Wednesday.
UF alumni Earl and Christy 
Powell donated the sculpture to the Harn Museum.
“We’re very excited to have 
this new focal point for the UF Cultural Plaza,” said Tami Wroath, the director of market-ing and public relations at the Harn. “It’s a work of contem-porary art, and that’s one of our 
collecting areas at the Harn.”The few people who walked 
by the construction site had a 
favorable first impression of the new piece.
“It’s actually really cool,” 
said Jasmine Naamou, a 19-year-old UF international stud-ies freshman. “I like the contrast of the red. I was thinking of the French Fries when I was look-ing at it.”
Pam Hightower, a 32-year-
old UF alumna who now works for UF Student Affairs, said she liked that the piece ”brings something that’s in the middle of campus kind of to the edge and connects them.”
Henry said he hadn’t 
thought of a nickname for his 
new sculpture, although some-
one told his wife, Pamela, that it should be called Big Mac in-stead of Big Max.
“They should have a contest 
for the best nickname,” Henry said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2014

Forty-nine cent hamburgers and 
69 cent cheeseburgers on Wednes-
days at McDonald’s proves one thing: Gainesville is lovin’ it.
Maybe a little too much.
Ten of the McDonald’s locations 
in Gainesville and the surrounding 
area, owned by J-Curt Inc., promote 
the deal on Wednesdays. Because 
of its popularity, the McDonald’s stores now have to limit customers to 10 burgers per order.
Terrance Troope, one of the man-
agers at the McDonald’s at 3418 SW 
Williston Road, said before the limit 
was placed on customers, it was not unusual for people to make orders of up to 100 hamburgers at a time.
“Customers will freeze the 
burgers so that they can eat them throughout the week,” Troope said.
The store was never in danger 
of running out of food, he said. The problem was that such a large order could hold up the kitchen and the drive-thru line.
Andrew Neale, a 21-year-old UF 
engineering senior, said he goes to McDonald’s on Wednesdays to take 
advantage of the promotion.
Neale normally goes through 
the drive-thru after class and takes 
the burgers home.
“The drive-thru lines are always packed when I go,” Neale said. “I can’t imagine what they would be like if there wasn’t a limit.”
The McDonald’s at 3826 SW 
Archer Road also has had to crack 
down on those taking the promo-
tion to the extreme.
Joanna Camper, a support man-
ager at the McDonald’s on Archer Road, said that many times people will place an order and then re-enter the drive-thru line to order again.
The McDonald’s on Archer 
Road is one of the busiest in the 
area because it attracts UF students, 
Gainesville residents and travelers on their way to Orlando, she said.
Troope said serving repeat cus-tomers who are overusing the deal makes people with small orders wait longer in line.
Tori Davis, a 20-year-old UF me-
dia and society senior, is a frequent 
visitor to the McDonald’s on Archer 
Road. She said McDonald’s strate-gy is smart because it draws college students who are trying to “pinch their pennies.”
This does not mean that people 
will not try to take advantage of it, she said.
“It seems like everyone pushes 
the envelope nowadays,” Davis said. “I just never would have imagined it would be McDonald’s hamburgers.”McDonald’s limits discounted hamburgers due to high demand

In the final meeting before Stu-
dent Government elections, Senate 
passed a resolution proposing addi-tions to rules and procedures.
After a presentation reviewing 
the changes to the SB2014-1016 Reso-lution Proposing Additions and Re-vision to the Rules and Procedures, senators adopted the resolution without objection.
Sen. Susan Webster, chairwoman 
for the special committee on rules and procedures, said coordinating the revisions was a long process that 
ended in triumph for the committee.
“We made a lot of great changes,” 
she said in her presentation. “We up-
dated things we weren’t doing be-fore and making sure what we were doing in Senate reflects what we are doing in codes.”
Some of the changes listed in the 
resolution included altering the quo-rum for senators during Summer semesters to be a majority of the to-tal membership and requiring new senators to attend a mandatory ori-entation session. 
Two bills approved funding 
for FACES Modeling Troupe and 
Sparks Magazine, with the organi-
zations receiving about $4,300 and $2,500, respectively.
Sen. Davis Bean, chairman for 
the Allocations Committee, said the committee approved the budget for both groups after working with them for several weeks. 
“To wait another week would 
have been us having to cancel their own events because of the eight-week period it takes to receive fund-ing,” he said.Senate changes rules
Founders: Bars could use the technology
will use the money to finalize pack-aging and create retail displays.
The UF mechanical engineering 
senior said he also hopes to expand the product line, focusing less on 
social applications and more on 
solutions to increase efficiency for businesses.
One of the biggest losses for the 
bar industry is the energy wasted by glass-front refrigerators, he said.Abbott said he believes they 
could take those refrigerators and either repurpose them or create a new product to replace them.
“We’ll do some studies and 
find out if spin-chilling the beers 
is more cost-effective than putting 
them in a glass-front refrigerator,” Parker said.
If the pair finds a solution, Spin 
Chill technology could find a place in the bar industry where business moves too fast to spin the drinks one-by-one.
Ian Mitchell, president of UF’s Entrepreneurship Club, said the company is unique because it has been able to succeed without taking large investments or moving out of town, unlike other local startups.
“There’s this sort of false idea 
that you have to leave Gainesville to do anything important,” said Mitchell, a 20-year-old UF interna-tional business graduate student. “In Gainesville, you can fail or suc-ceed extremely cheaply, and that’s something that is very rare to find alongside the wealth of resources that we have.”

A Swamp candidate did not qualify
Twitter campaign by Cory Yeffet, the party’s candidate 
for Student Body president.
“We would prefer the opportunity to display to the 
students what the Swamp Party and its candidates have 
to offer,” she said. “It is unfortunate that our willing and 
capable candidates are unable to debate and speak to the Student Body about these critical issues.” 
Additionally, on Tuesday night, the Elections Com-
mission heard two complaints filed by Supervisor of Elections Justin Hoover. One was brought against the Swamp Party, and the other against the Students Party.In the Swamp complaint, Hoover said the candidate, 
who was not identified, failed to turn in a qualifying form to the Supervisor of Elections by the deadline.
Swamp Party President Agassy Rodriguez said the 
party didn’t realize the Supervisor of Elections office didn’t have the right documents. 
The candidate will not be on the ballot because they 
failed to qualify properly.
Hoover presented the second complaint against the 
Students Party for failing to turn in weekly financial pa-perwork by the Monday deadline.
The commission ruled to issue warnings in both 
cases.

A new exhibit at Santa Fe Col-
lege showcases photographs from 
artists living in several countries but using the same low-tech equip-ment: disposable cameras.
“Present Company Excluded: 
or the Disposability of the Deci-sive Moment” is an art exhibition of photographs taken with dis-posable cameras by artists from Taiwan, France, Poland and the United States. 
It premiered last week at SFC’s gallery, located at the main cam-pus in M-147. The exhibition will run through March 24, Monday 
through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m. 
Jaclyn Gutierrez, art director for 
Reitz Union Board Entertainment, said disposable cameras are a me-dium that doesn’t get enough ap-preciation.
“You can do good art on a bud-
get,” she said. “I think that’s really 
important and adds to the accessi-
bility of art.” 
Exhibition manager Kyle No-
vak said the artists had to be selec-tive because they couldn’t see the developed pictures. 
“We’re so accustomed to digital 
photography and Photoshop,” he said. “In this show, the artist re-ally had to think hard about each exposure.” 
Samantha Mendez, a 20-year-
old UF ceramics sophomore, said she likes the concept because it shows that anyone can make art. 
“It doesn’t have to be the most 
expensive quality paper or expen-sive cameras,” she said. “They’re showing that anyone has access to a disposable camera.”

guage exchanges along the 
way.
Shaye said there is no 
multilingual or multicultural 
organization in Gainesville 
open to community members 
without university affiliation.“We wanted to fill that gap 
and satisfy the needs of those community members,” Shaye said. 
At the events, guests wear 
stickers that indicate their pro-ficiency in certain languages.
JungJun Bae, a 22-year-old 
Santa Fe College math major, 
attended Gainesville Lan-

“I think the proposal for 
this event is interesting and really convenient to attend, especially for those not in-volved in any institution or organization through UF,” 
Bae said. “Beer is better than 
coffee to get to know people.” 
Andrea Laba, a 23-year-
old UF Russian and political 
science senior, went to the 
exchange to find someone to practice Russian with. 
“I’m going to Russia this 
summer and I feel like this is 
going to help me get there and 
speak more comfortably,” Laba said.
Laba said she plans to keep 
coming to the Gainesville Language Exchange’s events in hopes that someone who speaks Russian will come.
“You can have a beer and 
relax and just converse with 
someone who’s just a regular 
person,” Laba said. Locals chat their way

For one day only, a carnival with a cause 
is coming to UF.
On Sunday, UF’s chapters of national 
coed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega and 
national South Asian-based fraternity Beta 
Chi Theta will hold the “Care to Play?” phi-
lanthropy carnival on Hume Field. 
The event, which will be held from 2 to 6 p.m., will raise funds primarily for Alpha Phi Omega and Beta Chi Theta’s philanthropies.
“This is something we’ve wanted to do 
for years, and we’ve just never had a service director to pick it up and run with it,” said Anantharam “Ram” Peesapati, a 20-year-old UF psychology and behavioral science junior 
who serves as Beta Chi Theta’s service direc-
tor. “My president came to me when I was elected and said, ‘We’re going to make this happen this year.’”
Seven additional organizations, including 
the Albanian Student Association, PeaceJam and the Bengali Student Association, will have booths with activities and crafts at the carnival, he said. Theatre Strike Force and various dance groups will also perform.
Though admission to the carnival is free, 
donations must be made at each booth to par-
ticipate.
Seventy percent of profits will go to Alpha 
Phi Omega’s chosen philanthropy, Free the Children, and Beta Chi Theta’s philanthropy, 
Beating Heart Disease. The remaining pro-ceeds will go to each of the booths’ chosen philanthropies.
Peesapati said the goal is to make the car-
nival a yearly event to raise at least $1,000 for philanthropies.
Katie Gresham, a 19-year-old UF history 
sophomore, said the charity aspect makes the carnival even more appealing.
“Philanthropic service is very important, 
especially here at UF,” Gresham said. “And I’m always looking for something to do on a Sunday that’s not homework.”UF fraternities to put on campus charity carnival Sunday

Gator foodies have a new on-
line resource for the latest in reci-
pes, reviews and articles about their favorite topic. 
Spoon University, a student-
run food publication, is in the be-ginning stages of launching a UF branch and is hoping to cater to UF students. 
A year and a half ago, Macken-
zie Barth, 22, co-founded Spoon University, a publication that centered on different aspects of food through the lens of college students and campus life. 
Spoon University began as a 
print publication at Northwest-ern University, and it made its In-ternet debut in September 2013.
The site features sections on a 
variety of food-related subjects. Restaurant reviews and recipes are the most popular categories on the site, Barth said.
“The recipe section is pretty cool because they’re all made by students, so they’re all verifiably easy to do,” she said.
The website began with chap-
ters at five campuses and has increased its college presence to chapters at 25 campuses nation-wide.“The ultimate goal is to make 
food accessible for college stu-dents,” Barth said.
Agata Kowalewska, a visiting 
assistant scientist at UF who has a Ph.D. in nutrition, said the site has the potential to be useful for students.
“From my previous research, I 
know that college students don’t know how to cook,” she said. “Many students have never been exposed to cooking.”
She said Spoon University could help students learn to cook.
Emily Bolter, a 20-year-old UF 
health education and behavior 
junior, said she agreed the new 
site could be a good resource, es-pecially recipes created by fellow students.
An avid baker, Bolter said 
she’s always on the lookout for new recipes.
“I think it’s pretty awesome,” 
Bolter said. “I would definitely 
look at it for updates.”

needs transparency, 
regulation
While we still delight in certain kid foods — looking 
at you, Cheetos and Yoo-hoo — some have grown less appealing with age. Our age, speciﬁ  cally. 
Now that we have more sophisticated palates, the idea 
of a square of plasticky Kraft cheese seems downright icky. 
Kraft Singles — despite how “wholesome” the commercials 
claim they are — are to cheese what that yellow grease in those dispensers at movie theaters are to butter: a cheap, syn-thetic imitation. Kraft is trying to ﬁ  ght that perception, and the Big Food company announced Tuesday that it plans to change the formula of its processed cheese squares to elimi-nate sorbic acid, the artiﬁ  cial preservative that keeps them “fresh” in the bottom of your fridge after you’ve long forgot-ten them. 
Kraft is the latest in the line of major food brands to an-
nounce changes in order to lessen the growing discomfort consumers have with chemical- and preservative-laden foods that crowd grocery shelves. According to Marketing Daily, Subway recently announced its removal of azodicar-bonamide from its breads. The chemical, which is used to create elasticity in products such as yoga mats and shoe rub-ber, is used in bread doughs by McDonald’s, Burger King, Chick-ﬁ  l-A and many others. In addition, General Mills re-
ported early last month that it would engineer the Cheerios 
formula to exclude genetically modiﬁ  ed organisms.
Increasingly, Americans are demanding more transparen-
cy and regulation of the food industry. Michael Moss’ expose “Salt Sugar Fat” was a No. 1 New York Times Bestseller, and the Pew Research Center’s food additives project examined the risks associated with Americans’ changing diets. Accord-ing to Pew, since 1958 Americans have consumed an exorbi-tant amount of processed foods, which contain large amount 
of chemical additives.
The consequences of an under-regulated food industry 
have been tangible: The United States’ high obesity rate was 
at 27.2 percent as of 2013 and climbing, according to Gallup. And America’s increasing distrust in Big Food coincides with the end of brand loyalty; while McDonald’s used to be hailed as an all-American food destination, it’s now the butt of jokes and the target of blame on our country’s obesity problem. 
“Today, consumers can read reams of research about 
whatever they want to buy,” wrote James Surowiecki for The New Yorker in an essay on the diminishing power of brand loyalty. “But what’s really weakened the power of brands is the Internet, which has given ordinary consumers easy ac-cess to expert reviews, user reviews, and detailed product data, in an array of categories.”
Today the same applies to food. If more pressure isn’t put 
on major food producers to lessen their use of chemical ad-ditives, America’s obesity rate will only climb — in addition 
to long-term health deﬁ  ciencies from eating lab-made food-
stuffs.
 TED Talks shift social responsibility
The motto of the informative and highly addictive 
TED Talks is “ideas worth spreading.”  Gainesville’s independent offshoot — TEDxUF — had plenty of 
ideas worth writing home about. Some of the area’s best and brightest took to the stage Saturday and shared their experiences, concerns and hopes for the future. 
Attendees laughed at a previously recorded TED Talk 
about how an improv group created mischief in Best Buy — 80 people entered the electronics store dressed like em-ployees in blue collared shirts and khaki pants — and cried when a speaker shared her experiences with cancer.
TEDxUF and the larger TED Talks are popular because 
they bring out the best in speakers and the audience alike. 
But when you dive into what TED Talks really are, it 
is not at all about the speeches or presentations. Though speakers — both live and recorded — command the stage, the talks are more about the audience. 
You can listen to the greatest speaker in the world, but 
if you don’t buy into his or her message, the speech is of no use. A speaker can give a powerful and stirring talk right in front of you, but if you don’t act on the message, you are wasting your time.    
Although it’s great to hear a powerful and rousing 
speech, it is not all that important. The crucial moment in any presentation is when the audience wholeheartedly be-lieves and buys into the presenter’s message. 
The so-called “secret sauce” that makes TED Talks a 
great event is simplicity. A bare stage sits in front of the audience with perhaps a few pieces of creative artwork strewn here or there. A presentation screen faces the au-dience. An unassuming speaker stands before a packed room. And that’s pretty much it. No overblown stage props, strobe lighting or fog machine needed. 
The only thing that can actually “be” in the talk is the 
speaker’s message. 
The message of TEDxUF was of hope, curiosity, person-
al and emotional fulﬁ  llment and creativity. The talks did not present any direct answers to the world’s gripping problems brought up by the speakers. But the genius of TED Talks comes from presenters challenging au-diences to answer problems for themselves, thus making the events more about the audience. It is up to the audience to act on 
the speakers’ messages. 
I believe that the smaller, independent TEDx events are 
more powerful than the larger TED Talks. The people who took to the stage at last week’s event were not Al Gore, Tony Robbins or any of the other marquee TED Talks heavyweights. Speakers were members of the Gainesville community: professors, students, alumni and friends. They were the audience members of past TED Talks who bought into the message of TED presenters, acted on their own convictions and wanted to spread a few ideas of their own. They dared the audience members to challenge their beliefs, strengthen their convictions and disregard the im-possible. 
This circle of TED Talks audience members turning into 
speakers who inspire their audience creates a community of empowered individuals — empowered not in the sense of being all-knowing people who can solve any problem, but in the sense of knowing a group of people who can solve these problems themselves.  
Last week, the TEDx presenters shined. Each one of 
them was stirring, engaging and entertaining. Because of that, the audience members are empowered to act on their rallying cry. Though the audience members may not know all of the answers to some of the problems brought up in the University Auditorium, they deﬁ  nitely know a way to reach an audience that will.

Recently at GatorWell we asked Uni-
versity of Florida students to provide us feedback about what speciﬁ  c questions they had about health.  The following are two of your alcohol questions that we thought were es-pecially great and our answers: 
Q1. What should I do when ev-
eryone around me is drinking and I don’t wish to drink?
First of all, if you choose not 
to drink, you are not alone. At UF, over 17,000 students choose not to drink alcohol.  The decision of when, where, and why you drink is yours. It should not be dependent on the drinking habits of those around you.  Remember that it is always okay to say no to a drink. Be polite but ﬁ  rm in your refusal. You can also carry around a non-alcoholic drink such 
as juice, soda, tea, and water.  Keep 
busy-make conversation, enjoy the meal or appetizers, take photos with other guests, or dance with your 
friends. Offer to be the sober des-
ignated driver. Explain your reasons 
for not drinking or make an excuse such as you’re allergic to alcohol, you have a test or project the next 
day, you have to get up early the next 
morning, you don’t want to spend the 
money, you’ve been sick and taking antibiotics, or it is contrary to your religious beliefs.  Regardless of what you say, the decision to not drink is your own and it should be respected by your friends.Q2. Is there any way to know if 
drugs have been slipped into your drink at your party?
It is important to remember that 
alcohol itself is the cheapest type of 
drug. It is also quite accessible and 
readily available.  It is easy to lose track of how many drinks you have consumed and quickly raise your 
Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) to 
over the legal limit of .08.  Further, 
if an individual has passed out from drinking too much, legally they can-not give their consent for sexual ac-tivity.  There is really no way to detect if an additional drug has been slipped into your drink.  Most drugs are odor-less, colorless, and tasteless. If a drug such as Rohypnol, Ketamine, 
or GHB has been slipped into your 
drink, you will being to experience the effects almost immediately in-cluding a sleepy, relaxed, and drunk 
feeling that lasts anywhere between 
2 to 8 hours. These types of drugs 
combined with alcohol can also re-sult in amnesia, respiratory depres-sion, and death.  Ways to decrease 
your risk include the following:
■ Get a fresh drink if you have left 
your drink unattended.
■ Never accept drinks from some-
one you don’t know, even if it is an acquaintance■ Watch the bartender or server 
make your drink
■ Use the “buddy system” to 
watch out for friends
■ Never leave a party or club with 
someone you do not know well and 
trust
■ Be alert to any unusual behav-
ior around you
■ If you suspect your drink has 
been drugged, seek medical help as 
soon as possible

hol, tobacco, and other drugs, visit

One of the keys to eating well on campus is knowing your options. Take a look around the dining 
locations that are most convenient for your schedule or check out Gator Dining’s website for a guide to smart food choices at locations across campus.
At the dining halls, stop by the salad bar to round out your meal with a few favorite veggies.
At eateries like Subway and Moe’s Southwest Grill take advantage of the option to add extra 
veggies to your sandwich or entree for free.
Look for substitutions like brown rice, whole grain bread or vegetable side dishes to easily 
pack in some extra nutrients.8, ALLIGATOR, FUN AND FITNESS � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2014
Managing Time for
Academic Success
Many college students have very busy schedules and the pres-
sure of being academically successful can be great, so being 
able to manage your time is essential!  In fact, according to 
a 2010 Healthy Gators survey, UF students reported that ef-fectively managing their time was “very important” to their academic success.  Indeed, learning how to manage your time 
helps increase productivity and reduces procrastination, both 
of which can improve academic success.  So how do you turn 
this knowledge into action?
1. Assess how you are currently using your time.  For 2-3 
days, keep a time log of what you do during the day and how 
long you spend doing it.  Afterwards, look for trends.  Identify 
which activities are important (see #2 ) and which are time wasters.
2. Know what’s important!   Prioritize your daily and weekly 
tasks.  Then, organize your time according to your priorities.  Higher priority tasks should come ﬁ  rst.3. Make time to manage time.  Set aside consistent time in 
your schedule to organize how you will use your time.  This can be done on a daily, weekly, monthly, and even whole-semester basis.   There are a wide variety of tools that can be used to help with this including planners, calendars, phone apps, and “to do” lists.  Pick whatever works for you and your organization style.
4. Minimize distractions.   Identify what your common dis-
tractors and time wasters are.  Then, come up with a plan to minimize these where possible.  This may mean studying in a different environment, turning off the TV and/or computer, put-ting your phone on silent, or even setting aside speciﬁ  c times of the day that you will not answer the phone or hang-out with friends.
5. Learn to say NO!  Sometimes it feels like you do not have 
enough time in the day to get everything done because… YOU DON’T.  If 24 hours rarely seems like enough time, then you may be putting too much on your plate.  Sound familiar?  Identify cur-rent activities that are not priorities and decrease them or cut them out completely.  In the future, before you say yes to some-thing new, ask yourself it if realistically ﬁ  ts in with your priorities 
and time.  If you do take on something new, think about cutting 
something else out of your schedule.6. Make time for yourself!  Living a balanced life is impor-
tant to your overall wellbeing.  Schedule time to take care of 
yourself and manage your stress.  Take breaks while studying, relax at the end of a long day, or schedule in activities that you enjoy doing such as volunteering, hiking, dancing, going to sporting events, or spending time with friends.

how to schedule an appointment with a wellness coach to work on time management, visit GatorWell’s website at gatorwell.ufsa.uﬂ  .edu.

Information provided by Samantha Evans, MS, CHES; Health Promotion Specialist at GatorWell Health Promotion ServicesAlways be Prepared!Accidents can happen:  Condoms can break because they are past the expiration date, stored improperly, or used incor-
rectly, especially in the heat of the moment. If you’re worried that a condom may break, you may want to keep the following 
points in mind.  
Condoms should never be stored in a wallet, car, or direct sunlight because heat, even body heat, weakens the condom 
over time. Oil-based lubricants also cause condoms to break. Instead choose a water or silicone-based lube (Astroglide, Wet, etc) which is safe for use with condoms and can help prevent breakage by reducing friction. Never use two condoms at once because the friction can cause both condoms to break. When putting the condom on, ﬁ  rst check the expiration date and squeeze the condom package to ensure it still has an air bubble (if it does not, the package and condom may be punctured). Open the package carefully (no teeth, nails, or scissors). Pinch the tip of the condom to leave space for ejaculation and unroll the condom all the way down. After sex, hold the base of the condom before withdrawing. 
If you or your partner ever ﬁ  nd yourself in a situation where the condom does break there are a few things to consider.  If 
pregnancy prevention is a concern, consider following your condom breaking incident with Plan B.  Also known as emergency contraception, or EC, the high-dose birth control pill is available over-the-counter and can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours. Plan B is most effective when within 24 hours.  Women and men over 17 years of age can call a doctor, a health clinic, a pharmacy, or place an overnight order from Drugstore.com without a prescription.
If sexually transmitted infections (STI) prevention is a concern, there are some things to consider.  There are different 
window periods, or time it takes for the STI to be detected in a persons’ system, so the timing of testing is important.  When it does come time to test, there are some reasonably priced or even free options to consider on campus or in the Gainesville community.  Free conﬁ  dential HIV testing for UF students is available on campus at the GatorWell main ofﬁ  ce (352-273-4450) by appointment only.  HIV testing , as well as other STI testing (including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and Syphilis), is also available at the Student Health Care Center (392-1161), Planned Parenthood of North Florida (352-377-0881) and at the Alachua County Health Department (352-334-7960). Depending on the site, pricing ranges from free to fees determined by a sliding scale fee or based on your insurance. WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, FUN AND FITNESS, 9

Tasty, Healthy Options 
When Time and Money are Tight
When you think of college students’ eating patterns, do you picture nutritious, balanced meals?  Or is the image ﬁ  lled with fast food, pizza, and eating ramen until you can’t stand to look at 
it ever again?  For many students the reality is somewhere in between and for good reasons.  Dr. Brian Wansink at Cornell University found that the average person makes more than 250 food-
related decisions a day. While studying why people choose the foods they do, Dr. Karen Glanz found that taste, cost and often convenience outweigh nutrition.  When you are making many daily food decisions in the context of an irregular, packed schedule and a tight college budget, it is easy to see why cost and convenience can trump nutrition.  What can you do if you want tasty, healthy food when time and money are in short supply? The trick is making nutritious choices both convenient and attractive so that the decision is an easy one.
Pack a Snack. Snacking is often a key source of fuel for busy days and 
late night study sessions, but the cost can add up quickly if you have to 
buy snacks when hunger strikes.  Have a stock of go-to snacks on hand: 
• Pack a banana, apple, carrot sticks or grapes – a great and inexpensive 
way to get some extra fruit and vegetable servings in. 
• Make your own trail mix at home with nuts, dried fruit, cereal and choc-
olate chips for a satisfying snack that is easy to pack.  You can change it 
up each week to ﬁ  t your tastes and ingredients that are on sale.  
• Bring a peanut butter sandwich for a low cost snack that can keep you 
going until your next meal.At the Grocery Store. Sticking to a grocery list and buying only what you know you will use can reduce unpleas-
ant surprises at the register.
• Opt for items that you can enjoy for multiple meals. Canned black beans, chicken breast, cheese, salsa, tortillas, 
and lettuce are loaded with vitamins, minerals, ﬁ  ber, and protein.  Turn them into burritos, quesadillas, and a taco 
salad.
• Weigh cost versus convenience.  Throwing out a ton of produce that you bought with the best of intentions can 
leave you rethinking future purchases.  If you are more likely to use the pre-cut fruit or bagged salad, the extra expense may be worth it in the long run.
• Consider trying a new recipe with friends and roommates.  Splitting up the ingredient costs and prep time can 
make it more manageable and you can all enjoy the leftovers.
With these strategies, you can help make your 250+ food decisions a little easier. Visit gatorwell.ufsa.uﬂ  .edu for 
more healthy eating tips.10, ALLIGATOR, FUN AND FITNESS, � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2014

Incorporating physical activity into your day can be a healthy habit that benefits every 
aspect of your life including stress levels, mood, energy, weight management, and sleep.  
According of a 2010 University of Florida Healthy Gators survey students ranked “exercise/fitness” as their fourth greatest health concern.  Sound relatable?  
The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends “Adults should do at 
least 2 hours and 30 minutes each week of aerobic physical activity at a moderate level.”  
Examples of moderate physical activities include walking briskly to class, dancing, biking, and swimming.  A good rule of thumb to know if you are working at a moderate level is that you should be able to talk while participating in these activities, but not sing.  Here are some tips to help you get started or increase your current level of physical activity:
1. Y ou don’t have to leave your house. 
■ Sit on an exercise ball while 
you read or write a paper.  
■ Get up during commercials and 
study breaks and do some jump-jacks, sit-ups, or push-ups.  
■ Use technology.  Try Wii fitness, 
Kinect, YouTube fitness videos, or fitness DVDs like P90X. 
2. Change your daily routines.  
■ Park at the end of the parking 
lot and use that opportunity to add physical activity to your er -
rands.  Chores count too- vacu -
um, dust, mop, scrub, they all get you moving.
■ Bike to campus.■ Walk to that next class rather 
than taking the bus.
■ Use a pedometer to track your 
daily steps- everything counts!3. Get Social! 
■ Get an exercise buddy that will 
keep you motivated..  
■ Grab a couple friends and take 
a trip out to Lake Wauberg.  
■ Join an intermural team, club 
team, or student organization.  From sailing to table tennis, quid-ditch to dance, there are lots of activities to try out on campus.  
4. Try New Things.
■ The Gainesville Rock Gym of -
fers a fun rock climbing experi-
ence.  
■ UF Rec Sports, community 
gyms and centers, and even the Alachua County Public Library of -
fer unique group classes such as Bosu, Country Line Dance, Dance Fusion, Yoga and Zumba. 
■ If you’re up for a little adven -ture, The Lake Alice walking/
biking path, Paynes Prairie State Preserve, Morningside Trails, and/or San Felasco Hammock Preserve are fun options to ex-perience nature while getting in some physical activity.  
5. Other Tips.
■ Gradually build new activities 
or longer time spent exercising into your routine.  
■ Feel proud of your accom -
plishments and celebrate your 
successes!  Use an app to keep track.
■ Keep at it! Try new things until 
you find an activity that is both challenging and fun.  The more you incorporate physical activity into your daily routine, the more you will start to feel the benefits of it.

Before tipoff on Tuesday night, 
coach Billy Donovan said he knew 
Tennessee would not shoot 26.8 
percent like it did last time it faced 
No. 3 Florida. Seniors Scottie Wil-bekin and Will Yeguete joined in to say there was no way Jordan 
McRae would have another 1-of-15 
shooting night.
Fortunately for the Gators, the 
Volunteers’ improved shooting performance was still not enough 
to topple the Southeastern Confer-
ence’s top team.
Florida (22-2, 11-0 SEC) extended 
its winning streak to 16 with a 67-58 
victory Tuesday night in Knoxville, 
Tenn., — one victory shy of tying the school record set during the 2006-2007 championship years. 
Although Tennessee (15-9, 6-5 
SEC) knocked down 19 percent more shots than it did when it vis-ited the O’Connell Center in a 67-41 loss, Florida held on long enough to 
earn only its second win in its last 
nine tries in the Thompson-Boling Arena.
 “I’m so proud of our guys,” 
Donovan said. “When you play on the road against a good team ... you’re going to have to go through some moments where you’re teeter-
ing, and I thought there were sever-
al moments in this game where we were teetering.”
The Gators were once again 
faced with an uphill battle in the first half; eight of their 11 SEC contests were at least seven-point games by halftime, including Tues-
day night. 
Although the Gators jumped 
out to a quick 10-2 lead, Jarnell 
Stokes, who finished with 20 points 
and 11 rebounds, and the rest of the 
Volunteers charged back to lead by as much as six after holding the Gators scoreless for just fewer than five minutes.
With 7:28 left in the first half, 
Florida held a 26-22 advantage but could not hit its next five field goals, allowing Tennessee to jump ahead 
32-26 with 3:51 remaining.
A five-point scoring stretch by 
Casey Prather and a last-second 
floater by Wilbekin cut the lead to 34-33 to end the half. In the first 20 
minutes, the Vols shot 63 percent 
compared to the Gators’ 36 per-cent.
“The thing I was most excited 
about coming out of the half was the fact that we were shooting 36 percent to their [63] and it was a one-point game,” Donovan said. “That was encouraging to me.”

Scottie Wilbekin drives the ball down the court in Florida’s 78-69 win against Alabama on Saturday in the 
O’Connell Center. On Tuesday, Wilbekin scored a team-high 21 points on 5-of-17 shooting against Tennes-see, leading his team to only its second win in its last nine meetings in the Thompson-Boling Arena.

The Gators failed to rally in the third 
round of the 2014 Northrop Grumman Re-
gional Tournament on Tuesday and finished 
in a frustrating 14th place. 
USC won the tournament with a score of 
866 (+14).
UF’s total score of 909 (+57) landed it two 
places from the bottom of the leaderboard.
It was a disheartening performance for a 
team that walked away from Palos Verdes, 
Calif., in 2013 with its fifth-straight top-five finish, coming in fifth after shooting 892 (+40).
“It was a disappointing day,” coach Em-
ily Glaser said in a release. 
“This event exposed some areas where 
we are lacking.”
Junior Sarah Schober, who competed 
as an individual, was the most successful player on the team with a total score of 215 (+2). 
She tied for third place with four other 
players, including No. 4 Yu Liu from Duke.
Junior Camilla Hedberg and freshman 
Maria Torres both finished with a total score of 226 (+13).

Aubree Munro did not like to hit 
last season, and her stats showed it.
During her freshman campaign, 
the Brea, Calif., native accrued a mea-
ger .145 batting average and struck out on 17 of her 55 at-bats.
“Last year, coach (Tim Walton) 
really challenged me,” the catcher said. 
“He said, ‘You need to love hitting. You need to learn to love hitting,’ which I didn’t love hitting 
because it wasn’t 
good to me. I’ve 
always been defen-sive. Me and de-fense were like best friends and hitting 
and I weren’t always on speaking terms.”
But through her first five games of Catcher getting better at 
plate after poor first season
Munro
 “I’m so proud of our 
guys. When you play on the 
road against a good team 
... you’re going to have to 
go through some moments 
where you’re teetering and I 
thought there were several 
moments in this game 
where we were teetering.”
Billy Donovan
UF coach
See Soft, p AGe 152014, Munro is already hitting 
.400 while logging seven RBIs and three doubles. She hit 
only four doubles and drove 
in only six runs last season.
Munro attributes her early 
success to her commitment to 
improve throughout the sum-
mer.
“I went home. I worked 
hard. I hit every day. I did something for my swing ev-
ery day,” she said. “I watched 
video of myself. I really tried to hammer out the details of my swings.
“Coach and I talked about 
my balance being a huge factor of my swing, so I just worked on being really bal-anced, simplifying and being 
really aggressive.”
Munro hopes to keep the 
hot streak going tonight at 6 
when No. 2 Florida (6-0) plays 
its first home game of the sea-
son against Jacksonville (3-2) at Katie Seashole Pressly Sta-
dium.
“It’s going to be fun to open 
up at home,” she said. “It’s a 
great town, great fans. Gator nation has been very good to 
softball, so we’re excited for 
everyone to come out, watch us play at home, and start off the season.”
After their match against 
the Dolphins, the Gators will be heading back on the road to compete in the Easton Desert Classic in Las Vegas. Despite 
the quick turnaround, Munro 
feels the amount of playing time the team is receiving will only benefit them.
“February’s kind of a heavy 
month for us,” she said. 
“We play a lot of games in 
a short amount of time. But it’s kind of good for us. … 
We’re living out of a suitcase 
for a little bit, but we get tons of reps, tons of game experi-ence to lead us into SEC play where it really starts to get re-ally intense.”
Freshman pitcher pro-
vides depth: Delanie Gour-ley impressed her teammates throughout the USF Wilson-DeMarini Tournament.
“Delanie is so much dif-
ferent from me and Hannah (Rogers),” junior Lauren Hae-ger said. “We all bring some-
thing super different to the 
table, which as a hitter in my mind, that’s really hard to ad-just to.”
The freshman left-handed 
pitcher, who Walton called a “program changer,” left Tampa with her first two col-legiate wins, including a 9-4 
victory against then-No. 5 
Michigan.
Haeger, who has team-
bests in strikeouts (18) and 
ERA (1.08) among Florida’s 
starters, feels that having three pitchers in the starting rotation will only benefit the team.
“All the pitches are going 
in a different direction, so I think everyone, all three of us go together well because 
we are so different,” Haeger 
said. 
“And I think it’s going to 
help us in the long run when we need that last out to have 
a fresh pitcher.” Florida began the second half 
with a 20-12 run, which built 
enough of a cushion for the Gators 
to endure another scoreless streak 
that lasted just fewer than six min-utes this time. 
Back-to-back threes by Michael 
Frazier II, who finished second on the team with 11 points, and Wil-
bekin, who finished first with a ca-
reer-high 21 points, made it a two-possession game and essentially sealed the victory.
Despite Wilbekin’s game-high 
scoring output, the senior finished the night only 5 of 17 from the floor, including just 1 of 6 from beyond the arc. The Gators as a whole sunk only 36.2 percent of their shots, the 
lowest efficiency this season, but 
their hustle and effort made up for the poor shooting night.
Senior Patric Young’s six points 
and six rebounds don’t show his 
impact on the court late in the 
matchup.

in Round 1, but after shooting seven-over during the second round and canceling 
out two birdies with two double bogeys, 
she plummeted to 38th place — a stark contrast to her successful eighth-place fin-ish in 2013. 
Torres ended in 38th place, tying with 
Hedberg and four other players, after con-cluding the tournament with three rounds 
of 72-77-77 in her Palos Verdes debut.

Senior Elcin Ulu and freshman Karolina

and 240 (+27). Ulu failed to recover from six bogeys 
and two double bogeys in the first round, 
despite improving in the second and third rounds.
Vlckova had her most successful round 
on Day 3, shooting three birdies, but could not overcome shooting four double bogeys and nine bogeys during the previous two rounds.
“I stand by my sentiment that this is a 
talented team, but we have a lot of work to do if we want to be competitive week in 
and week out,” Glaser said.
The Gators’ next competition will be in 
two weeks at the Allstate Sugar Bowl at the 
English Turn Golf Club in New Orleans. 
The team tied for 10th place with Okla-

Three days between games is 
not a lot of time. 
That is how long No. 8 Florida 
(0-1) has to correct the mistakes 
that led the team to a 20-8 loss at No. 1 North Carolina (1-0) on Sat-urday.
Three days for the team to re-
ﬂ  ect on each ground ball not won, each draw that UNC took pos-session of and a relaxed defense that allowed 20 points to slip past 
redshirt senior goalkeeper Cara 
Canington and sophomore goal-keeper Mary-Sean Wilcox.
“We need to speed up our of-
fense; I think we were very de-liberate, very methodical,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. 
“We let their defense dictate 
what we did and didn’t do defen-
sively.”
Tonight at 6:30, UF will host 
Jacksonville at Donald R. Dizney 
Stadium. 
In 2013, Florida defeated Jack-
sonville University (0-1) 15-4. Ju-niors Shannon Gilroy and Nora Barry helped lead the team to its second consecutive win of 2013. 
Gilroy put two points on the board 
and had three draw controls, while Barry scored one point and also had three draw controls.
While the two juniors will 
be back on the ﬁ  eld to help lead the team Wednesday, it does not mean the Gators do not have a lot to work on until then.
O’Leary said that losing 24-
12 on ground balls was a sign of some of the issues that will have to be addressed throughout the 
season.
“It’s just one of those things 
that we have to get better at; we 
have to get better on the draw, we 
have to get better on the ground 
balls,” O’Leary said. “That was what I think was a little disheart-ening is the fact that, that was in our control. 
“We could have picked up 
those ground balls. We could have gotten those balls because 
it’s a 50-50 draw.”
Now that the ﬁ  rst game has 
been played, the team can begin 
to work out the kinks. However, O’Leary said while there were 
many problems that needed to be 
addressed, there were also many positive plays that were made.
“(We) saw a lot of promise out 
of our freshmen; we had four that started,” O’Leary said. 
“We were so excited to see 
their play out there and their nev-er-give-up attitude.”

With the Southeastern Con-
ference Championships a week 
away, the Gators swimming 
and diving teams have found answers for the remaining 
question marks on their roster. 
However, Florida is not 
about to tip its hand, waiting until SECs to unveil the lineup.
“We’ve pretty much decid-
ed who we’re going to swim. The athletes know,” coach Gregg Troy said. 
“They’re all real good swim-
mers, and we’re just not going 
to divulge that.”
But it was not an easy deci-
sion for Troy. It’s one he has 
been wrestling with for weeks.
The result is six swimmers 
on the men’s squad being left 
out — swimmers who could 
compete for most of the other schools in what might be the best conference in the country, 
Troy said.
The 22-man roster — 19 
swimmers and three divers — 
will travel to Atlanta on Sun-
day for the ﬁ  ve-day conference 
meet beginning on Feb. 18. 
But the season is not over 
for the ones who did not make 
it. 
The ﬁ  nal meet to qualify 
for NCAAs, the Bulldog Last 
Chance Meet, will follow SECs from March 1-2. Georgia will host as Florida, Auburn, Mis-souri, LSU, Kentucky, Ala-bama and Arkansas make up 
the eight-team pool.
The Gators will also be look-
ing to qualify swimmers for 
the national meet at the SEC 
Championships.
“It’s kind of unique because 
we’ve got a group of athletes 
that at the conference meet if they’re not real good there it’s 
probably the end of the sea-
son,” Troy said. 
“And some of those really 
need to qualify for the NCAA 
meet.”
Then there is the group of 21 
swimmers who already have 
registered NCAA “A” cuts.
Troy knows the pressure 
will not be as big for them as the others at SECs. 
But he is still looking for 
swimmers like redshirt se-
nior Sebastien Rousseau, se-
niors Marcin Cielsak and Brad deBorde on the men’s side and sophomore sprinter Natalie Hinds and seniors Elizabeth 
Beisel and Ellse Zalewski for 
the women to step up and de-liver at the conference meet, but not tire themselves out.
“We’d like to make sure 
that there’s still plenty of gas left in the tank for the [NCAA] meet,” Troy said. “They’ve got dual focuses.”UF setting roster for
