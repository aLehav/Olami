Hannah Rogers has proven time and 
time again her value to the Florida soft-
ball team.
In her four years in the circle for Flor-
ida, Rogers led the Gators to a 127-31 re-cord in 191 appearances.
She was UF’s ﬁ  rst four-time All-Amer-
ican in softball program history.
She tossed three solo no-hitters over 
her ﬁ  nal two years with Florida to go along with her 41 career shutouts.
And after leading Florida to its ﬁ  rst 
Women’s College World Series title in her ﬁ  nal year, Rogers can add one more accolade to her list as she was announced as the 2014 Southeastern Conference Fe-male Athlete of the Year on Tuesday.
“It makes me proud to have done this 
for the University of Florida, but also for the game of softball,” Rogers said in a re-lease. “Though the game is getting bigger 
and bigger, it probably doesn’t get the 
recognition it should, so this is something I can take pride in.”

Ten minutes. Hundreds of hot dogs. 
Ninety-degree weather.

rant’s ﬁ  rst Hot Dog Eating Contest on Friday.
“Every Fourth of July on Coney Is-
land, they have the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest,” said Nicholas Smith, general manager. “We wanted to bring that here since there’s no other event like this in Gainesville.”Contestants will line up at 2 p.m. on 
Friday at the restaurant’s front lawn to eat as many hotdogs and buns as they can in 10 minutes, Smith said.
Restaurant servers will act as as-
sistants, feeding participants more hot dogs, water or anything else they need to bring home the gold. Managers will keep count of how many hot dogs and buns each person eats.

CRIME

A Gainesville man is accused of hitting, biting and chas-
ing a maintenance worker after an argument about door locks 
and then yelling racial slurs. 
Gainesville Police arrested 33-year-old Curtis Antonio 
Wims on charges of aggravated battery and aggravated as-sault along with committing a hate crime on Monday, accord-ing to an arrest report.   
At about 4:10 p.m., an argument between David Raymond 
Rossman, a local maintenance man, and Wims began, concern-ing locks being installed in Wims’ girlfriend’s living room. When Rossman tried to leave, Wims blocked him and 
made racist comments, according to the report. Wims then punched Rossman in the nose.    
Rossman grabbed Wims to avoid getting hit again, mak-
ing both of them fall onto the couch, according to the report. Wims continued to hit Rossman’s back and bit his nose with enough force to leave marks.  
Rossman was able to get away, holding his electric drill, ac-cording to the report. Wims ran after him and grabbed the drill Rossman dropped and then chased him around the yard. 
Wims said, “Cracker, I’m going to f**k you up,” according 
to Rossman in the report.
Unable to catch up with Rossman, Wims left the area and 
was later found near the 2000 block of East University Av-enue.
After questioning, Wims said he did not like “crackers” 
and that Rossman started it all, according to the report. Wims 
said he did not bite Rossman’s nose. 
Ofﬁ  cers booked Wims into the Alachua County Jail 
on Monday at 5:30 p.m. As of press time, his bond is set to 
$75,000.  Police say local man with drill chased maintenance man
“Cracker, I’m going to f**k you up.”

There will also be giveaways

“Crowd Favorite,” awarded to 
the participant who has the most 
people cheering for him. 
Smith said he hopes the spe-
cial prizes will draw more peo-
ple to the event and help it grow 
in its first year. 
“We wanted everybody to get 
something for eating,” he said, 
“and not just stomachaches.”
So far the contest has about 
seven registered participants, 
Smith said. 
A form is available on The 
Swamp’s Facebook page to reg-
ister for the event and can be 
submitted in person or by email-ing it to swampoffice2@aol.com.
Jessica Richards, a 23-year-old 
psychology junior, will be work-
ing the event as both a server and manager. 
“I think it’ll draw people 
in having something to watch rather than seeing something on TV,” Richards said.
The restaurant, located at 
1642 W. University Ave., will have normal business hours on the holiday, allowing people to come eat and watch the event. 
The Swamp will also be giv-
ing customers the option to or-der from a special Fourth of July menu consisting of four types of hot dogs, potato salad, BBQ beans and more, Smith said.

ican than hot dogs,” he said.  4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 3, 2014

UF’s astronomy observatory 
was recently ranked fourth in a list 
of the top 25 college observatories in the nation on CollegeRank.net.
According to the listing, the 
Rosemary Hill Observatory is a strong selling point for students who aim to study the stars, physics or related areas.  
“It provides a good training 
ground for our graduate students who need to use large, sophisti-cated instruments elsewhere,” said Howard Cohen, associate professor 
emeritus in the UF astronomy de-
partment. “It provides an opportu-nity for them to get their feet wet.”
Founded in 1967, the RHO is 
about 30 miles southwest from Gainesville. The facilities include two telescope domes, a dormitory and utility buildings, according to the UF astronomy website.
Unlike many other observatories 
featured on the list that are public, the RHO is private and intended more for research, Cohen said. UF’s Astronomy and Astrophysics Soci-ety has visited the observatory at 
least once a semester in the past two 
years as part of their social events, said Natalie Foster, a 20-year-old UF astronomy and physics senior and president of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Society.
Satellite photos show Rosemary 
Hill near the center of the largest dark area in north Florida, where it 
is free from light pollution, accord-
ing to the UF astronomy website.
“A lot of people are surprised 
when they go out there for the first time because it’s in a part of Florida that doesn’t have a lot of big cities so it’s really open, and the trees are low, so we have a lot of sky to look at,” Foster said. “Sometimes you 
can see the Milky Way. It’s really 
nice.”
Foster said she believes that the 
department could continue to gain recognition for the observatory if given the support it needs.
“I think if we could get a little 
more money to improve it, we might get that award again some-
time,” Foster said. “I think it’s defi-
nitely something that we can strive toward.”UF observatory gets star ranking

Students looking to apply to law 
school may no longer need to take 
the LSAT starting in August. 
The American Bar Association 
recently said accredited law schools can admit 10 percent of an entering class without requiring the LSAT. 
The UF Levin College of Law In-
terim Dean George Dawson wrote 
in an email that the change will be 
considered when the faculty meets to evaluate its admissions. 
“We will review data from prior 
years in order to assess the poten-tial impact of such a change on our admissions policies and on our stu-dents,” Dawson said.
To be considered, a student must 
apply to a law program at the same institution as their undergraduate 
program or must be seeking a J.D. 
degree in combination with a degree of a different discipline, according to the ABA. A student must also have scored at or above the 85th percen-tile on the ACT or SAT. 
Students with the combination of degrees must have scored at or above the 85th percentile on the GRE or GMAT,  must be ranked in the top 10 percent of their under-
graduate class or have a cumulative 
GPA of a 3.5 or above throughout six semesters of academic work. 
“These requirements should en-
sure that highly qualiﬁ  ed students will be admitted even if they have not taken the LSAT,” Dawson said. Incoming Levin College of Law 
student Elise Holtzman, 23, said because she spent so much time improving her LSAT score, a law 
school that does not require it would 
become less attractive to her. 
“I don’t know if the LSAT is nec-
essarily the best method of measur-ing a person’s ability to think logi-cally,” Holtzman said. “But there has to be something.”

They may not be playing in the FIFA 
World Cup, but the Special Olympics Uni-
ﬁ  ed soccer team came, saw and conquered at the 2014 Special Olympics USA Games.
The Orlando Special Olympics soccer 
team took home the silver medal at the USA Games in New Jersey.
Olivia Marincov, a 20-year-old UF ap-
plied physiology and kinesiology junior, has been involved with Special Olympics since she was in the eighth grade, coaching soccer at a summer camp to children with autism 
and playing in this year’s Olympic games.
Marincov was a Uniﬁ  ed Partner, some-
one without an intellectual disability, for her 
team, which practices three times a week.
“Just like a regular soccer practice, we do 
conditioning and ball-control drills,” Marin-cov said. “They’re just like us, but some-times you just have to break things up and ﬁ  nd different ways to say things.”
In June, the Orlando team played against 
Nebraska, and although they lost 2-0, Marin-cov said it felt like they won.
She received a phone call on Tuesday from her coach that her team received a bid 
to go to the Special Olympics World Games 
in the future.
“It’s a huge part of my life, and it means 
a lot to me,” Marincov said. “I’ve seen the team grow up as players and as people.”
Danielle Spears, spokeswoman and pub-
lic relations director for Special Olympics Florida, said the goal of Special Olympics is to provide year-round sports training and 
competition for children and adults with in-
tellectual disabilities by offering them a fair opportunity to demonstrate their skills and increase public awareness.There were 180 Florida athletes and 
coaches who attended the games this year, she said. 
In total, 3,500 athletes participated, and 
there were more than 70,000 volunteers and families present. 
She said that the success of this team is a 
win for inclusion and acceptance for people with intellectual disabilities.
“We really believe in the transformative 
power of sports,” Spears said. “By sharing their abilities and successes with the com-munity, we hope to shatter stereotypes about people with disabilities.”UF student helps US Special Olympics soccer team win secondReader response

Just when you were starting to miss the dumb “teen 
trends” (created by the lamestream media to keep us dis-tracted from real issues in the world), a gem comes along. The latest teenage-dude gross-out trend to make clickbait-y 
headlines this week is called “Bubbling.” Bubbling is pretty 
straightforward: For whatever reason, guys are peeing into 
their own mouths and posting pictures of it on social media.  
Honestly, of all the teen fads to get upset over, this one’s 
gotta be the least scandalous. It’s certainly nothing compared 
to vodka eyeballing, vodka tamponing or anything else in-
volving vodka entering various bodily oriﬁ  ces. We’re toss-
ing a you-can-be-more-creative-than-that DART to the un-
creative lame-os coming up with horrible teen trends these days. 
And of course, Americans are still talking about Tuesday’s 
FIFA World Cup match. The U.S. squared off against Belgium for a heartbreaker of a game. Thanks to the record-breaking 16 saves by America’s new heartthrob, Tim Howard, the U.S. men’s national team walked away from Brazil with at least 
some dignity. 
The bearded, tattooed future 2016 presidential candidate 
(we wish) can come back to the States and never pay for a 
drink again. And after the abysmal outing the U.S. had on offense, we wouldn’t blame the American hero for knocking

ard.
Here at the Alligator, we love Tinder — talking about it, 
comparing matches and analyzing our bios (our opinions 
editor recommends using esoteric Spongebob quotes to stand 
out among the scores of long-haired, skinny-arming sorority 
girls). But this week, the details of a nasty lawsuit between Tinder’s co-founders was released to the public. Whitney Wolfe, one of the app’s co-founders, is suing the company 
for sexual harassment, alleging that she was belittled by fel-
low co-founders Justin Mateen and Sean Rad. In addition to 
receiving nasty texts from a fellow co-founder and ex-boy-friend, she was threatened to have her title as co-founder stripped because having a female co-founder would make 
Tinder seem “like a joke,” according to New York Magazine. 
Wow. How are we ever going to encourage women to en-
ter STEM ﬁ  elds when misogyny and sexism run rampant and 
unchecked. We’re tossing a  f**k-you-and-your-Mad-Men-
bullshit DART to Tinder founders Mateen and Rad.

In an effort to save American democracy from the evil ty-
rant, “King Obama the First,” Speaker of the House John Boehner revealed that he plans to sue the president for 
overstepping his constitutional authority. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is where the American de-
mocracy stands in 2014. 
Government is almost completely paralyzed by out-of-
control partisanship, inane tactics that prevent Congress from completing the people’s business, while a visibly frus-trated President Obama attempts to salvage what’s left of his presidency. 
Ironically enough, it’s Obama’s response to congressional 
inaction that ultimately led to Boehner’s threat of legal ac-tion. Presidents are allowed to sign executive orders, which 
use the power of the executive branch to help push policies 
that in some cases, cannot or will not come out of the legis-lative branch. What’s even more laughable about Boehner’s valiant effort to save democracy is that Obama’s use of ex-ecutive orders lags far behind his predecessors. 
As of now, Obama has signed 182 executive orders, lag-
ging behind the 291 signed by George W. Bush and the 364 signed by Bill Clinton. By comparison, Franklin Roosevelt signed 3,522 during his time in ofﬁ  ce. King Obama, indeed! 
At a time when the U.S. economy is still struggling to gain 
signiﬁ  cant traction, Iraq has devolved into a chaotic night-mare, and the immigration crisis along the U.S.-Mexican border is out of control, Boehner is placating the far right by suing a president who happens to be a constitutional lawyer, suggesting Obama has exceeded his constitutional author-ity. 
The petulant children allegedly leading our great country 
continue to be more concerned with scoring political points 
and hearing their sound bites on cable news than running 
the country. Honestly, has there ever been a group of such self-obsessed, thickheaded jesters running the funny farm in Washington? To solve the crises our nation and the world face, it’s well past time for our leaders to put aside the parti-san drudgery and accomplish a goal — any goal — that leads to a positive future for our country. Neither party is right and neither is wrong; what is needed is a conﬂ  uence of decent ideas from both Democrats and Republicans that could actually help push an agenda forward and ﬁ  nally bring an end to the era of useless brinksmanship. 
Young people have a pretty 
wretched opinion of their govern-ment and our leaders, and with good reason. Sadly, the leaders of our parents’ generation seemingly 
wiped their rears with the accomplishments of previous gen-erations, focusing on themselves rather than the nearly 400 million Americans counting on them. 
Governing is not for the selﬁ  sh, but we the people have 
found ourselves in a position where we have elected a siz-able group of people who cares little about the American people and only about their own self-image. 
Obama wants to do the right thing, but he’s found few 
allies in Washington and for all intents and purposes sees the writing on the wall: No one in the Republican Party will meet you halfway. 
Individuals — many of whom subscribe to the tea party’s 
conservative philosophies — who were elected on a platform 
that government is the root of all evil and must be abolished 
have accomplished their goal by successfully running two of our three branches of government into the ground. 
Obama’s belief that those of different backgrounds can 
work together to accomplish great things have been great-ly eroded and his patience — along with the millions who didn’t elect the leaders in Congress — seem to be at an end. Where is our country going and what do we want to accom-plish in the 21st century are two questions we must ask of 
our leaders and ourselves?
For the sake of the American democracy and its future, 
the children running the cuckoo house in Washington must 
end this nightmare or step out of the way so actual leaders can guide our nation into the future. We have the power to change that with our votes this fall. How will you use it?

Farm. Light from the setting sun streamed in through the farmhouse’s floor-to-ceiling 
living-room windows as guitarist/singer Victoria de Benedicty, guitarist/singer 
Dalton Jacob and fill-in drummer Jared 
Reddick practiced for III Bones’ farewell show at High Dive on Saturday night.The farm belongs to 18-year-old de 
Benedicty’s parents. She and Jacob, 24, the band’s ounders, are preparing to relocate 
from the de Benedicty’s home to Austin on 
July 8 in their recently acquired used 1992 Tiffin Motorhomes RV. After 18 months of making music to-
gether, the pair is ready to get its feet wet in the city’s flourishing music scene and 
find more musicians to fill out the band. 
They recorded their third album, which 
will be released this fall, at Good Danny’s, 
a recording studio in Austin owned by Danny Reisch. 
The new record, scheduled to be re-
leased later this year, represents a growth spurt for the group. The songs are a bit more up-tempo, a bit more rock ‘n’ roll 
and a lot more refined as III Bones estab-
lishes itself as a serious lo-fi soul outfit.  
“Long term, we want to tour in this,” 
Jacob said and gestured at the inside of the RV, “for like, the next 50 years. It’s like a 
certain type of addiction when you go on 
tour.” 
Since III Bone’s formation in early 2013, 
de Benedicty and Jacob have played more 
than 200 shows in Gainesville and along 
the east coast, recorded three albums and opened for acclaimed indie bands like Surfer Blood, Reptar, Hank & Cupcakes, Matt Pond PA and Jacuzzi Boys.  
From the moment they met at an open 
mic night at an Ocala bar on Jan. 1, 2013, the two have remained focused on writ-ing, performing and recording as much as 
possible.
Jacob, a Warped Tour veteran who had 
been in and out of pop-punk bands since 
he was 16, knew immediately after seeing de Benedicty cover of the Kinks’ “Strang-
ers” at O’Malley’s Alley that he wanted to 
perform with her.
“(She) was so good that no one in the 
bar was talking,” Jacob said. “They were 
just turned around, watching her. I don’t 
even know if the guitar was in tune — it

For those seeking fun other 
than fireworks this Fourth of July, 
you can check out The High Dive: The local music venue will host a celebration with food and musical performances.
The High Dive will host its sec-
ond annual Ska BBQ event this Friday.  With a spin on traditional festivities to celebrate the nation’s independence, Wholly BBQ will cater the event while four regional Florida bands perform.
The bands include Control 
This, from Orlando; UNRB, from St. Petersburg; Chilled Monkey Brains, from Tallahassee; and The Duppies, from Gainesville.  
Each group offers a different 
take on ska, a musical genre that combines Caribbean elements with American jazz and rhythm and blues.The event is open to all ages 
and begins at 8 p.m.  There is a $7 cover and additional charges for the catering.
High Dive hosted the first Ska 
BBQ last year because it wanted to offer the community a unique, local event to celebrate during the Fourth of July, said Pat Lavery, event organizer for  High Dive.
“It’s a great opportunity to 
have good, authentic barbecue and enjoy local music,” Lavery said. 
If you are not interested in 
staying to listen to the music, ev-erybody is welcome to enjoy the barbecue on the porch.
For Martin Poirier, a 20-year-old UF history sophomore, the event sounds like a modern twist on the traditions of the holiday.
Even if the musical option isn’t 
mainstream, people in Gainesville seem to enjoy any excuse to party, he said. 
Lee Yefet, a 19-year-old UF ad-
vertising sophomore, thinks that the Ska BBQ is a good opportuni-ty to have a good time during the holiday and a chance for the com-munity to celebrate together.
“If you can’t find anything to 
do, it’s a great alternative that still has barbecue and music.”

After much album-date release 
confusion and pandering to white 
girls on Twitter to revamp excite-ment, Houston-based rapper RiFF RAFF ﬁ  nally released “Neon Icon” 
on June 24.
This album is a mixture of new 
sounds and his traditional Versace 
rap game with the common themes of drugs, ballin’ and b*****s all throughout. “Neon Icon” stands out from his old work in one prominent way — his skit tracks. I have literally no idea what they are for because I 
listened to the album while sober.
He continues to bring his fan base 
(read: white girls) relatable songs 
to the table in the almost surf-rock sounding “Kokayne” with lyrics like “I brought out the rice / She was down to play / We were up all night on cocaine.” My personal favorite lyrics come from that song: “Now 
its 3 a.m., Taco Bell / I’m stacking 
up my cheese like a taco shell / I’m sliding through your city on a turtle shell.”
Riff Raff channels rap game Kid 
Cudi in his skit “3 Moons,” a talking piece reminiscent of “Indicud” that I imagined Riff Raff whispering to Selena Gomez if he actually played 
Alien in “Spring Breakers.” Some 
important lyrics: “This is the moon talking to you, it’s the actual moon / I want you to be nice to everybody 
you’re around”
“Tip Toe Wing In My Jawwdinz” 
is the ﬁ  rst song on the album that 
brings back the authentic Jody Highroller sound — it’s really remi-niscent of songs on “Rap Game Bon Jovi” with a slow, creeping beat and almost whispering vocals building up to the main verse that he deliv-
ers with his traditional enthusiastic 
emphasis on each syllable.
The album really changes it up 
with “Time,” a twangy, country-hip-hop hybrid. I know the idea sounds awful, but trust me when I say it’s pretty good. Riff Raff sings over the beat while an acoustic guitar strums in the background. It’s almost ro-
mantic, until the auto-tuned bridge.
The only song with a reprise, 
“How To Be the Man,” really is the 
best song on the album. Packing the 
lyrics “Show you how to be man, how to be the boss /How to buy the 
car, how to buy the house,” maybe 
UF should take a few notes and re-place what is the good life with a class called how to be the man.
Overall, I give the album four-
and-a-half stars out of ﬁ  ve. I take half a star off because the second-to-last song, “VIP Pass to My Heart,” sounds like an over auto-tuned 
song from some Disney teeny-bop-
per with sexual undertones.  Why would you try to end an album on that note?might’ve been slightly out of 
tune. But that really didn’t mat-
ter. It was just (her) singing, play-
ing acoustic guitar into that mi-crophone.” 
After having played piano 
since she was 2 years old, de Benedicty picked up guitar and learned to sing by mimicking the vocal styles of the blues artists she loved.
She was bored with top 40 pop 
music and fascinated by blues, especially the guitar playing of Robert Johnson, Blind Willie Mc-
Tell and other Delta-blues style 
artists. 
“You listen to those recordings from the early 1920s, and they’re 
just so raw,” de Benedicty said. 
“There’s just nothing else like 
it. I really felt something in that music that I didn’t feel about 
anything or anywhere else.” 
The two clicked instantly that 
ﬁ  rst night, realizing they had similar musical sensibilities and shared a passion for lo-ﬁ   blues rock that was earthy and honest, unprocessed and gritty. 
In a matter of weeks, they 
wrote, recorded and self-released their ﬁ  rst EP, “Organic.” In April 
2013, they released their second 
album, “No Great Shakes.” 
They started performing 
around Ocala wherever they 
could. They acted as house bands 
for both a Greek restaurant and 
a tattoo parlor, and they played secret shows at a local Starbucks 
while preparing to move beyond 
Florida.
Following de Benedicty’s 
graduation from Hale Academy in May 2013, Jacob spent last fall booking shows, and soon, the duo, along with former drummer Jason Sands, began performing in clubs along the east coast. 
Audiences in New York City 
loved them, Jacob said, and they 
planned to return that winter, but 
the north polar vortex cold wave caused storms that resulted in the cancellation of the band’s plans 
to go back. 
“I guess we were sad for maybe 
six hours,” Jacob said, “Then we 
just (went to Austin), replanned, locked ourselves in and made a 
whole new album.”
They credit the momentum 
they earned in Gainesville to lo-
cal musician Waylon Thornton, 
who acted as a mentor and ad-
viser, and Pat Lavery, owner of the promotions company that or-ganizes High Dive events.
Lavery, owner of Glory Days 
Presents!, met Jacob and de Bene-dicty through Thornton. 
After one show in April 2013, 
the duo said they took Lavery to 
dinner at Moe’s and asked for ad-
vice on how to “get serious.”
 Lavery, who has longtime 
roots in the Gainesville music scene as an agent and booking manager, said their eagerness to learn and listen was a quality that not many artists have. 
He advised them to be persis-
tent and grateful.
“They’re such nice kids,” La-
very said,“they have ‘It’ — this 
charisma about them that’s really 
important for getting people ex-cited about a band. They’re un-pretentious, and that’s a big part of why I like them.” 
They plan to debut songs off 
their new album on Saturday at the High Dive. 
Doors open at 9 p.m., and tick-
ets are available for $5 in advance or $6 at the door.THURSDAY, JULY 3, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Matt Sherman wants to show you what is on 
the menu — James Bond’s menu.
The 45-year-old Gainesville author and UF 
religion alumnus has created a website where 
people can donate money to publish a higher 
quality version of his book, “Eating James Bond: 
007’s Every Last Meal.” He has until July 15 to reach his $20,000 goal.
That money will be used to cover the cost of 
color printing, have a professional photographer shoot meals and memorabilia and to advertise the book. The book will be published in black and white if the $20,000 goal is not achieved.
The Bond novels became famous because of 
the sense of travel and the detailed descriptions of international cuisine, Sherman said.  The agent has something to eat every 10 minutes during a two-hour ﬁ  lm. 
Sherman said his book can serve as a tour 
guide to all the different locations that Bond has ever had a drink or eaten a meal.
“You can eat what Bond eats, where Bond 
eats,” Sherman said.
The cuisine plays a bigger part in the mov-
ies and books to a true fan, said Frank Herbert, 66, who has been studying James Bond novels and movies for 50 years and is a member of the International James Bond fan club based in the U.K. Average fans may only notice a few meals 
here and there.
“When I was younger 
everyone wanted to eat 
what James Bond ate,” Herbert said. “People 
were even interested in the type of toothpaste he used.”
Some things have changed since then, con-
sidering the opinion of Alan Ferry, a 27-year-old aerospace engineering junior. 
“I don’t enjoy martinis whether they’re shak-
en or stirred,” Ferry said. “I prefer beer.”
The book will be published through Cre-
ateSpace, Amazon.com Inc.’s self-publishing platform, and it will be available on Amazon and other outlets, Sherman said. The book is sched-uled to be published by Aug. 1. Books will cost approximately $25 for the black-and-white ver-sion and $35 for the color version.
The site started accepting donations May 31, 
and at the time of print, the donation total was at $1,760. Donate at  bit.ly/1lAeGNJ.Booze &  food with James Bondbooks

Animals hate America’s favorite 
holiday. Fireworks scare them, hot 
dogs upset them and bug spray makes them sick. It’s no wonder that more pets are lost on the Fourth of July than 
on any other day of the year.
The Humane Society is already pre-
paring for the inﬂ  ux of lost animals, 
mostly dogs that will run away due to the ﬁ  reworks. “Most people don’t re-alize how scary it is for animals,” said Amanda Burks, executive director of the Alachua County Humane Society.
Burks suggests bringing pets inside 
before the festivities get underway. She recommends leaving pets at home if you are going to a party.
Any changes to an animal’s diet can 
add stress as well. Tossing your dog a burger can cause digestive issues. Common Fourth of July items like bug spray and citronella candles can make pets sick if ingested.
Never leave alcoholic drinks un-attended or within reach of animals, Burks said. Intoxicated with a belly-ache during an earsplitting ﬁ  reworks display is not how your pet wants to spend its evening.
Setting up a safe space for your pet, 
such as a crate, is an essential precau-tion, Burks said. If your animal al-ready has medication for storms or a 
Thundershirt — a shirt that uses gentle 
pressure to provide a calming effect on dogs — Burks recommends using those.
“Dogs aren’t as good at hiding, so 
they ﬂ  ee,” Burks said. “Cats are just as scared, but they’re better at hiding, so they run under the bed instead of jumping over the fence.”
The animals at the Humane Society 
will be kenneled earlier than normal on Friday. Being in their “safe space” keeps the agitation level low, Burks said.
The best precaution is to make sure 
that pets have proper identiﬁ  cation makes it easier to get animals back to their owners. Furry friends fear the 4th

Recipes are, on one hand, an in-
struction manual with directions or 
instructions on how to make some-
thing and also a narrative with en-
gaging prose or a story that elevates the procedure into something else entirely. 
Like directions on how to as-
semble an ice cream maker or build a bookshelf, most recipes instruct an addressee in a coherent, clear lay-out, often with steps broken down 
into numbers or bulleted points in 
chronological order. 
Yet, recipes are different than 
other instruction manuals. Let’s make a comparison.
Compare the following instruc-
tions: (1) instructions on how to set up a network security key for your computer (from Windows) and (2) a recipe from a Duncan Hines cake mix.
Recipes, like instruction manu-
als, typically use imperative or com-mand tense such as “bake” or “mix.” These may be offset from the rest of 
the directions by font styling with 
all caps (like example 2), made bold, italicized or underlined. 
Also, like instruction manuals, 
there is an implicit subject and does 
not make direct reference to the 
reader. Indeed, from its Latin root recipere, recipe means “take!”We often do not want to wade 
through dense text to ﬁ  nd out how 
to set up a wireless network or to 
bake a cake for that matter. 
However, we are more willing 
to invest effort and time reading a recipe than in other procedural 
discourse. Some admit to having 
a cookbook on their bedside table. Why? We put more in because we get more out, especially with reci-
pes that have an explanatory, prose-
based layout, as in (3) below.
Good recipes go beyond the basic 
mechanics of cooking: they enable the reader/cook to know what to 
look for during and after the cook-
ing process. Parenthetical explana-tions provide reasons or additional descriptions about the desired re-sults, increasing our understanding 
of the cooking process. They build 
credibility in the recipe as an at-tempted and successful procedure. So, thanks to the recipe writer’s previous attempts, if we want run-
nier yolks, then we know to cook a 
minute less. We understand more the why than just the how.
Other recipes have prose that 
conjures up scenes in the reader’s mind, such as “I remember, when I was in the south of Italy, eating eggplant that had been roughly chopped, sprinkled with dried wild 
oregano, doused with olive oil, and 
then roasted with a little garlic and a lot of red onion,” according to Nige-lla Lawson.
The reader is able to imagine 
Italy and taste the vegetables voy-euristically through the narrative. Even without precise quantities or detailed cooking instructions, the recipe is able to inspire the reader 
with novel possibilities proposed 
and new techniques for cooking and presenting a dish. And beyond the content level, we have a sense of 
the personality of the writer and the 
world from which the recipe origi-nates.
Recipes may be the best manual 
of all in that even if you don’t fol-
low all the steps, it doesn’t mean 
you won’t have success. In fact, the recipe may be even better.

1. Preheat oven to 350 F for metal 
or glass pans, 325 F for dark or coat-
ed pans*. Grease sides and bottom of each pan with shortening or oil spray. Flour lightly. (Use baking cups 
for cupcakes).
2. Blend cake mix, water, oil and 
eggs in large bowl at low speed until 
moistened (about 30 seconds). Beat at medium speed for two minutes. Pour batter in pans and bake imme-diately.
3. Bake following chart below. Add 
3 to 5 minutes to bake time for dark or coated pans. Cake is done when 
toothpick inserted in center comes 
out clean. Cool in pan on wire rack for 15 minutes. Cool completely before frosting.
Bring a medium saucepan of wa-
ter to a boil. Lower six large organic 
eggs into the rapidly boiling water. Simmer for exactly nine minutes. (For a slightly runny center, cook the eggs 
for eight minutes.) 
Remove the eggs from the boiling 
water and plunge them into a bowl of 
ice water to stop the cooking. When the eggs are cool (this doesn’t take very long), tap the shells on the coun-ter to crack them, then return the eggs to the ice water. 
This will allow the cold water 
to seep between the eggs and the shells, making the eggs easily peel-able. The eggs will be ﬁ  rm but with a moist, soft yolk.(1) Installing a Network Security Key

UF and Miami agree to series
The Florida men’s basketball team agreed to renew 
a home-and-home series with the Miami Hurricanes starting in the O’Connell Center on Nov. 17.  Teeing Off
Former Florida tight end Aaron Hernandez is featured in a 2014 Florida football calendar. The calendar was not produced by UF but was approved by ofﬁ  cials months before Hernandez was charged with murder in 2013.Despite Tim Howard’s heroic performance, the U.S. lost 2-1 to Belgium on Tuesday.

With the heavily anticipated reno-
vation to the Stephen C. O’Connell 
Center coming soon, there were bound 
to be leaks of the new additions.
But what Sports Illustrated’s Tim 
Newcomb published surpassed any-
body’s wildest dreams for what a new 
O’Dome would look like. Unfortunate-
ly for dreamers, the designs belonged to the losing bidder NBBJ, a company 
connected to the ﬂ  edgling project to 
renovate Kentucky’s Rupp Arena as well as UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion.
Instead, the winner was a combina-
tion of Davis Architects, Gainesville-
based Charles Perry Partners Inc. 
(CPPI) Construction Management and TLC Engineering. The school an-nounced that the trio met for the ﬁ  rst time Tuesday.
Davis Architects is a ﬁ  rm based 
in Birmingham, Ala., that has done work on both endzone expansions at the University of Alabama’s Bryant-Denney Stadium as well as the design 
of Auburn Arena, which is Auburn’s 
new basketball facility. Other clients include the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Samford University, Bir-mingham-Southern College and Geor-gia State University.
Davis has 
worked with UF and spe-ciﬁ  cally the 
O’Connell Center during the 18,500 square foot expansion of the gymnas-tics practice facility in 2012. The reno-vated space earned a LEED Gold rat-
ing.
CPPI has done most of the recent 
renovations or expansions Florida 
fans and players  enjoy with the cur-rent facilities on campus including the 
Southwest Recreation Center, the lock-
er room at McKethan Stadium and the Heavener Football Complex. 
CPPI also built the basketball prac-
tice facility and is responsible for both MORGAN MORIARTY

The 2014 edition of The 
Opening football camp kicks off this Friday and runs until 
July 10 at Nike’s headquar-
ters in Beaverton, Ore. 
The invite-only event pits 
the top 2015 recruiting pros-
pects from across the coun-
try against one another in a variety of skills challenges as well as 7-on-7 tournaments.
The camp, which features 
162 of the top high school se-niors, will include a handful of Florida commits and tar-gets. 
The three commits in at-
tendance will be quarterback Sheriron Jones (6-foot-2, 189 pounds, Moreno Valley, Ca-lif., Rancho Verde High), 
wide receiver Derrick Dil-
lon (5-foot-11, 175 pounds, Franklinton, La., Pine High) and cornerback commit Marcus Lewis (6-foot-0, 194 pounds, Washington, D.C., 
Gonzaga College High). 
Jones, who will be on 
Team Alpha Pro along with 
Dillon, will arrive in Beaver-ton on July 5th to compete in 
the Elite 11 quarterback chal-
lenge, and will be assigned a team following its comple-tion. The Elite 11 challenge 
has produced high-proﬁ  le 
quarterbacks including Tim Tebow, AJ McCarron and Jameis Winston.
There are a number of top 
Florida targets participating as well, including the No. 4 ranked offensive tackle Martez Ivey (6-foot-5, 271 
pounds, Apopka, Fla., Apo-
pka High). 
Ivey has offers from in-
state rivals Florida State and Miami as well as seven offers 
from Southeastern Confer-
ence schools. 
Florida’s top wide re-
ceiver target George Camp-bell (6-foot-3, 183 pounds, Tarpon Springs, Fla., East Lake High) is set to partici-
pate in the week-long event. 
Campbell, a bigger offensive target, might not ﬁ  t perfectly in Kurt Roper’s new offense — one that relies on speedy 
receivers to make plays by 
creating space. 
However, Campbell is 
still at the top of Florida’s of-fensive big board. 
Ray-Ray McCloud 
(5-foot-9, 176 pounds, Tam-pa, Fla., Sickles High) is listed as an athlete on Team Mach Speed but is consid-
ered a running back prospect 
for the Gators.

A week prior to the start of the World 
Cup, I may have been able to name three 
players on the U.S. men’s national soccer 
team. And one of them would have deﬁ  nite-
ly been Landon Donovan (oops).
Nevertheless, my lack of soccer knowl-
edge didn’t stop me from cheering on the 
Red, White and Blue on Tuesday amid a 
throng of drunken spectators in The Rowdy Reptile.
I celebrated each of Tim Howard’s 16 
saves. I groaned at Chris Wondolowski’s 
blunder in the 93rd minute. I screamed, “I 
believe that we will win,” along with my in-toxicated brothers and I meant every word.
OK, so maybe I still can’t recite the Yanks’ 
starting lineup. Maybe I still call it a ﬁ  eld instead of a pitch. Maybe I still call it soccer and not futbol. So what?
For the most part, soccer fan groups like 
the American Outlaws have been welcom-
ing new followers of the game ever since the 
World Cup kicked off in June. 
However, there is still a pretentious 
few calling out the bandwagon fútbol aﬁ  -
cionados. What are you guys complaining 
about?
Landon Donovan, who was left off the U.S. roster for the World Cup, put his bitterness 
aside and encour-
aged the American public (the entire American public) to skip work and 
support its country 
by tuning in. 
That’s what I did and, as a result, I learned 
to appreciate the sport and its players a lot 
more than I have in the past.
As frustrating as it might be for lifelong 
fans to see hoards of bandwagoners talk out 
of their asses about something they don’t re-ally know much about, the result may soon 
be worth it.
Four years from now when the U.S. com-
petes in Russia during the 2018 World Cup, 
many of today’s bandwagon fans may be 
veteran members of the American Outlaws. 
The sport needs to grow somewhere and 
it’s up to the lifers to help integrate the new-
er followers into the fanbase to ensure the future popularity of the game.
Those who have been following the U.S. 
men’s national team before it was popular have the opportunity to lay the groundwork for soccer’s reputation in the upcoming Embrace the bandwagoners Design and build team

(108), saves (14), strikeouts 
(833) and innings pitched (988.0), among other catego-
ries. She also finished sixth 
in program history with a ca-reer 1.63 ERA.
Rogers posted a 30-8 re-
cord in her senior campaign, marking the third time in her career that she reached the 30 win mark. The Lake Wales, Fla., native also led 
the Gators in her final run 
with 27 complete games, 12 shutouts, 167 strikeouts and a 1.60 ERA in 223.1 innings 
pitched.
Rogers pitched in all five 
games of the Women’s Col-
lege World Series, tossing four straight complete games 
— including three shutouts 
—  to start Florida’s journey in Oklahoma City.
She then capped the trip 
with a two-inning save in the title-winning contest against Alabama.
“For it to go to our most 
unselfish athlete just says 
a lot about Hannah and so 
much about our team,” UF softball coach Tim Walton said in a release. “I’m excited 
for her to get the award, but 
also excited for our team to have put her in position to get that award.”
Since the award’s incep-
tion in 1976 for male athletes and 1984 for female athletes, seven Gators have won the award a combined 10 times, 
with Tim Tebow (2008 and 
2009), Danny Wuerffel (1996 and 1997) and Nicole Haislett (1993 and 1994) each claim-ing the honor twice.
Rogers is Florida’s first 
SEC Athlete of the Year re-cipient since Tebow in 2009, 
and she is UF’s first female 
athlete to claim the award since Haislett in 1994.
Each school selects one 
male and one female athlete for the award each year, and 
the winner is decided by a 
vote among the league’s ath-letic directors.
UF’s male athlete nomi-
nee was point guard Scot-
tie Wilbekin, who led the 
Gators basketball team to a 38-win season, a 30-game win streak, a perfect record 
in conference play and the 
program’s first Final Four berth since 2007. 
The Gainesville native fin-
ished the season as the SEC 
Men’s Basketball Player of 
the Year, SEC Tournament MVP and a third-team All-American. 
Wilbekin paced the Gators 
with a 2.1 assist-to-turnover ratio and 56 steals in a team-best 34 minutes of playing time per contest.ASSOCIATED PRESS
SAO PAULO — Turns out Ju-
rgen Klinsmann was right: The 
United States isn’t ready to win the World Cup.
The Americans were eliminated 
in the round of 16 for the second straight tournament. They’ve been ranked 13th or 14th every month since September, which means their exit was pretty much at the stage it’s expected to be.
“Clearly it gives you the message 
you have a lot of work still ahead of you,” the U.S. coach said Wednes-
day, a day after the 2-1 loss to Bel-
gium in extra time.
Klinsmann was a World Cup 
champion as a player with West Germany in 1990 and coach of the German team that reached the 2006 semifinals. Having moved to Cali-fornia in 1998 with his American wife, he is seen as bringing the per-
spective of soccer’s elite to a nation 
that remains a new world in the sport.
His message to players is they 
don’t do enough. They don’t play twice a week, like Champions League stars. They don’t face con-demnation from their community after losses and poor performances.
“It makes them feel accountable, 
not just walk away with a bad per-formance and nothing happens,” he said. “If you have a bad perfor-mance, then people should approach you and tell you that, so make sure that next game is not bad anymore 
and that you step it up.”
The Americans’ final match, 
which kicked off at 4 p.m. EDT on 
a weekday, was seen by 21.6 mil-lion on ESPN and Univision, im-pressively close to the record 24.7 million set for a Sunday evening game against Portugal earlier in the 
tournament. An average of 1.6 mil-
lion watched the loss to Belgium on digital streams.
“People now start to care about 
it. Fans care about it. They comment on social media. They comment ev-erywhere about it, and that’s good,” Klinsmann said.
His most controversial moves coming into the tournament were cutting Landon Donovan, the big-gest star in U.S. soccer history, and taking along 19-year-old Julian Green, 20-year-old DeAndre Yed-
lin and 21-year-old John Brooks. 
Brooks and Green responded with late-game goals when they came in as substitutes, and Yedlin was stellar against Belgium when he replaced injured right back Fabian Johnson.But Klinsmann’s proclamation 
that the U.S. would play an attack-ing game didn’t pan out. The Amer-icans were outshot by a combined 92-41.
“The interesting part is every 
time we would go down a goal, we’ll shift it up,” he said. 
“I believe it’s more a mental topic 
that we have to work on than it is a talent topic.”

The University of Florida announced Tuesday that the team of Davis Architects, CPPI Construction Management and TLC Engi-
neering will begin meeting to discuss the renovation of the O’Connell Center, which will occur after the 2014-2015 season.
O’Connell Center renovations still $15 million away from goal 
the 2003 and 2013 renovations to the west side of Ben 
Hill Griffin Stadium. 
The indoor tennis facility that CPPI worked on also 
bears the name of the company namesake Charles R. Perry and his wife Nancy.
Tallahassee-based TLC Engineering has worked 
on numerous projects across the state, including 
Florida International’s football stadium, PGA nation-
al resort and spa, the Amway Center and the Citrus Bowl. 
The company specializes in engineering projects 
related to airports and hospitals, which make up the 
bulk of TLC’s design portfolio.
In June, athletics director Jeremy Foley stated that 
the O’Connell Center renovations are still $15 million 
away from a price tag that should exceed $50 mil-
lion once all work has been completed, which would 
make the renovations the priciest UAA facility over-haul since the $52 million  expansion of the west side of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in 2003.
If the project goes as planned and the funding 
stays on track, renovations will be finished by the end of 2015. The construction would displace teams that compete in the O’Dome in the fall like the basketball teams, which will presumably play games in other 
sites across the state during that time.hooPs , from page 17FootbAll , from page 17Nike football camp will

years. 
Many across the world got a glimpse of 
the crowds at Soldier Field in Chicago , the 
Power & Light District in Kansas City, Mo., 
and the Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C. And they liked what they saw, which was a youthful, rowdy mob of individuals band-
ing together to cheer for their country.
So we might not live on soccer like other 
nations do, but when the time comes we 
know how to throw a party and support the Red, White and Blue. That sentiment will 
only grow as the years go by.But even as an admitted bandwagon fan, 
I get upset when I see self-proclaimed zeal-
ots of U.S. soccer preach about aspects of the sport they really know nothing about (watch Jimmy Kimmel call out ignorant “fans” by 
asking them about Landon Donovan’s per-
formance during this year’s World Cup).
If you just started watching soccer, admit 
it. You’re not impressing anyone by faking 
your way through a conversation. Every fan 
has got to start somewhere so admit you know nothing and work on it.
Do your research. Watch some matches. 
Jump on the bandwagon and get comfort-
able.
I’m in this for the long haul. How about 
you?zooP’s scooP ,
