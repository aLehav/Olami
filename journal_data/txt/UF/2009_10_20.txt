Sand-filled backpack
causes bomb scare
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewa rt@alligator org
No drugs, no bombs, just
sand.
The Reitz Union parking ga-
rage was shut down for about
six hours Monday while police
investigated an unattended back-
pack that turned out to contain 25
pounds of sand.
Police later learned the back-
pack had been left behind on Sat-
urday by the JanSport backpack
company.
JanSport participated in UF's
Homecoming parade on Friday,
driving a multicolored 1967 Volk-
swagen van, University Police
Department Det. Michael Metz
said.
"A lot of the elements that
are in sand are also found
in fabric softener."
Art Forgey
ASO spokesman
The company, which parked
its trailer at the union's parking
garage, used the checkered black
and olive-green bag as a tire
wedge to keep the van in place
while on display, Metz said.
No charges will be filed against
any of the company's employees,
he said.
Monday's saga began when a
maintenance worker discovered
the backpack on a loading dock
at the union around 8:30 a.m. and
called police.
Police closed the parking ga-
rage and barricaded part of Mu-
seum Road while the Alachua
County Sheriff's Office bomb
team sent a robot to take a look.
The robot discovered what ap-
peared to be a white, powdery
substance wrapped in a blackplastic bag covered with duct
tape, according to police.
After analyzing the substance,
police initially reported it to be
fabric softener.
They later changed their diag-
nosis to sand, however.
The mistake was made be-
cause the two substances are fair-
ly similar, said ASO spokesmanArt Forgey.
"A lot of the elements that are
in sand are also found in fabric
softener," Forgey said.
Sgt. J.J. Moran, commander
of the ASO bomb team, said the
event was good training for his
squad and said it's better to be
safe than sorry in situations like

jobless rate falls
By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
For the past year, the country has become familiar with eco-
nomic failure.
But Alachua County may be slowly emerging from the
wreckage.
According to a report from the Florida Agency for Work
Innovation, Alachua County's unemployment rate has fallen
a second consecutive month from 7.2 percent in
Local August to 7.1 percent in September.
News In the past month, 5,100 jobs have become
available in the Gainesville metropolitan area,
which includes Alachua and Gilchrist counties.
Rebecca Rust, the agency's chief economist, said the figures
have much to do with the relatively high proportion of govern-
ment employment in the area, which includes local education
and universities.
According to Rust, state government positions make up
3,500 of the 5,100 new positions, something she attributes to
students returning to school in the fall.
"Although government isn't completely recession-proof, it
tends to be more stable than other industries during weak eco-

Gainesville gets real
for MTV casting call
H IT IS EXPECTED TO DRAW
200 TO 500 PEOPLE.
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
Gainesville is about to find out
what happens when people stop
being polite and start getting real.
MTV's "The Real World" is
holding an open casting call for
anyone between the ages of 18
and 24 interested in becoming one
of the "seven strangers picked to
live in a house and have their
lives taped" for its 24th season.
The interviews will be held
today from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. at
Hooters, 3265 SW 34th St.
Casting directors ask that thoseinterested bring a photo ID and a
recent picture to the audition but
leave any rehearsed acts at home.
"The honest truth is that you're
being evaluated on who you are,"
said Damon Furberg, supervising
casting director for Bunim/Mur-
ray Productions, which produces
"The Real World. "You can't an-
ticipate what we want because we
don't know what we want."
Furberg said Gainesville was
selected in large part because of
UT.
"We always go somewhere in
Florida [for casting calls] because
we always do pretty well there,"
Furberg said. "It was Gaines-
ville's turn."

County targets drivers who illegally pass school buses
FINES RANGE FROM $194 TO
$294.
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Alachua County law enforcement agen-
cies will be on the lookout this week for
drivers who illegally pass school buses.In Florida, it is only legal to pass a school
bus when there is a median of at least five
feet, a raised median, or a physical barrier
that separates vehicles from the school bus.
Otherwise, when a school bus turns on its
flashing lights and extends its stop signs,
drivers must stop or they could be fined.
Drivers who pass on the left of a stopped
school bus are subject to a $194 fine, which
is $10 more than last year, according to Art
Forgey, a public relations officer for AlachuaCounty Sheriff's Office.
Those who pass on the right of a school
bus can be fined $294 and have to appear in
court. Passing on the right side of the bus
where students get on and off
Local is a criminal offense.
News "Children often don't pay
attention when they get off
the bus, so drivers need to be extra critical to
ensure their safety," Forgey said.
ACSO is launching the effort as a part ofOperation Bluebird, an annual driver safety
awareness campaign.
Dan Brinsko, a parent and lieutenant of
the ACSO traffic unit, started the program
about 10 years ago.
According to Forgey, a 2000 survey indi-
cated that there are 180 incidents of illegal
bus passing each day.
"I think some people become complacent
and inattentive," Forgey said. "But chil-
dren's safety is a huge issue."

Mudfest celebrates
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
One of UF's longest-stand-
ing traditions is also one of its
dirtiest.
Until Nov. 1, the Tolbert
Area Council will host 40
Years of Mudfest, which sparks
friendly competition among
Tolbert Area residents.
Scott Mangino, graduate
hall director of North Hall and
Tolbert Area Council adviser,
said the chance to organize
events like Mudfest was one
of the main reasons he chose to
go to UF for graduate school.
"Mudfest started in 1969
as just a one-day event," he
said. "It's definitely changed
and evolved and become more
competitive. It's been one of
those events that a lot of our
students come back here for."
On Sunday, an opening cer-
emony that kicked off Mudfest
attracted about 100 people.
There were several speak-
ers, including Gainesville may-
or and former Tolbert Area
resident Pegeen Hanrahan and
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, assistant
vice president for student af-
fairs at UF.
This is the longest Mudfestin the event's history, running
for two weeks from Oct. 18 to
Nov. 1.
Mangino said one of the
reasons organizers extended
the event was to allow those
who do not live in the Tolbert
Area to participate in Mudfest
as well.
"For the next 40 years,
people will still be play-
ing in the mud. As long
as there's mud there,
this event will still be
going on. Who doesn't
want to go and play in
some Georgia clay for two
weeks, get dirty and have
fun with your friends?"
Scott Mangino
graduate hall director of
North Hall
CompetitiveMudfestevents,
where residents from different
floors compete for points, will
run Monday through Friday
from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Athletic competitions in-
clude MudUltimate, or ulti-
mate Frisbee, MudTug, or tug
of war, MudPolo, a variation of40 years
water polo played in the mud
pit and MudVolleyball. Stu-
dents also participate in rock
picking competitions, where
the teams who collect the most
rocks from the pit win points.
While the competitions are
limited to Tolbert Area resi-
dents, many Mudfest events
are more inclusive. A clothing
drive to benefit Peaceful Paths,
a network that provides aid to
victims of domestic violence,
will be held Friday at 7:30 p.m.
in conjunction with Student
Government.
On Oct. 24 and Oct. 31, a
large screen will be set up near
the mud pit to allow students
to watch Gators games against
Mississippi State and Georgia,
Mangino said.
Mudfest will conclude with
the annual Mud Dance on Nov.
1 at 7 p.m., where students are
encouraged to wear their Hal-
loween costumes.
"For the next 40 years, peo-
ple will still be playing in the
mud," Mangino said. "As long
as there's mud there, this event
will still be going on. Who

Teacher brings music to ESE students
0 HE WAS NAMED FLORIDA ESE
TEACHER OF THE YEAR.
By ERICA JOHNSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Donald DeVito arrived at the Sid-
ney Lanier Center School, music classes were
held in a portable with only seven instru-
ments.
Today, the disabled students at the school
take music classes in a large, colorful room
filled with instruments, uniforms and mu-
sic.
DeVito, who was recently named Florida
ESE teacher of the year, began to build the
school's music program eight years ago while
he was working on his doctorate at UF.
He said the more he worked with the
students and spent time developing the pro-
gram, the more he fell in love with it.
"I was working on my dissertation and
teaching here part time, and I was just too
enthralled with what was going on here and
enjoyed building the program here too much
to leave," he said.
DeVito said the program is tied to colleges
like Syracuse University and the University
of Londrina in Brazil, and music majors from
the schools develop lessons for the students
at Sidney Lanier. The college students hold
teaching sessions with DeVito's students
through Skype and a large SMART video
board in the classroom.
He serves on the board of the International
Society for Music Education Commission for
Community Music, which is a field of study
in which people travel around the world and
develop programs for the needy.
"They might go to the Middle East and
develop a music program that has Palestin-
ian and Jewish children together," he said.
"Someone in Ireland who's a community
musician might even have a Protestant and
Catholic ensemble."
About one-third of DeVito's 60 students
are unable to speak, and the others have dis-
abilities like autism, Down syndrome and
cerebral palsy. They use music to express
themselves, he said.
"Music really helps students to transcenduounesy o uonaia uevizo
Donald DeVito, far left, and his students at the Sidney Lanier School pose at Disney
World before a performance.
their challenges through creative self-expres-
sion," he said. "I believe that there is really
only one ability needed to participate in mu-
sic education, and that is the ability to feel.
As long as the music can reach you through
an effective response, then everything else is
just accommodation."
For students who are unable to speak,
DeVito programs music into a device which
allows the students to select songs they pre-
fer to hear. In some cases, instruments are
also modified to accommodate the students.
Students whose hands are too fragile to play
bongo drums are given a specialized mallet
to strike the drum with instead.
DeVito emphasized the importance of
taking the students out into the community
and allowing them to perform. Last school
year, they became the first ensemble of dis-
abled students to perform at Festival Disney,
a music competition held at Disney World,
where they received an Excellent rating.In May, the group will perform at Carn-
egie Hall in New York City.
Staff members at Sidney Lanier have no-
ticed the effect DeVito's music classes and
teaching style have had on the students.
"Academics isn't a strong point for these
kids, so it gives them a chance to do some-
thing positive," said Connie Lee, a teacher
at the school. "It does a whole lot for their
self-esteem."
She said that DeVito has been able to take
what so many view as a negative and turn it
into a positive.
"I mean, other parents get to go to base-
ball and footballs games to watch their kids,"
Lee said. "But these parents, well, they get to
go to Carnegie Hall."
DeVito acknowledged that what he does
isn't always easy, but that he wouldn't trade
it for more conventional students.
"To me it's a challenge," he said, "and I
absolutely find it to be a rewarding one."

double fee
to $300K
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Tonight's Senate meeting will fea-
ture the reappearance of a bill that
would double Student Government's
administrative fee to $300,000.
The fee, taken from SG reserves,
helps pay for services like the Univer-
sity Police Department, finance and
accounting services, the UF General
Counsel and Human Resource Ser-
vices. The bill was introduced at last
week's meeting
Student but was sent backGovernment to the Budget
and Allocations
Committee after senators requested a
breakdown of the fee.
Committee chairwoman Virlany
Taboada said the fee increased be-
cause UF can't cover as much as it
used to because of budget cuts.
"I think, for the most part, we've
been paying a really small amount in
comparison to the services we've re-
ceived," Taboada said.
Last year, SG paid $150,000 in ad-
ministrative fees. Next year, the fee
may increase to more than $400,000,
or 6 percent of SG's budget.
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Jon
Ossip said he worries that, if SG
agrees to pay the fee, there will be no
limit on the amount of money the ad-
ministration continues to request.
"The administration is essentially
charging us to exist," Ossip said.
Ossip said he wishes senators
could discuss the fee with administra-
tion representatives.

rage were closed off and the Alachua County Sheriff's Of-
fice had to send a bomb squad robot to detect a potential
explosive.
Just because the section of campus affected by the scare
only "involved an area with a roughly 500-foot radius," is
a text message not worth the safety of the students within
that area?
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said that officials only
use the system when there is a "credible threat that has the
potential to affect the entire campus."
Orlando said UF did not send out a mass text message
because officials did not see a clear threat to the univer-
sity.
There was a bomb threat. On campus. At the University
of Florida.
As students, we would rather see the university err on
the side of cau iion and alert the student body when there's
a potential bomb sitting near where we're enjoying our
mid-morning MexiMelt from Taco Bell.
And what kind of fabric softener contains sand as a
main ingredient?
ASO spokesman Art Forgey said that the two substanc-
es are fairly similar. Since when did Snuggle start using
sand?
We were less than impressed with the bomb squad ro-
bot's performance, as well.
Not only did it incorrectly identify the substance in
question, but it also dropped the powder-filled backpack,
spilling its shady contents all over the Reitz Union park-
ing lot.
Regardless of whether the backpack was filled with
sand, fabric softener or Anthrax, if it takes a robot to detect
its ingredients, it may be in the university's best interest to
inform students next time.
From their perspective, we can understand if university
officials don't want to inform students of every little thing
that happens on campus to avoid crowds gathering and
creating too much commotion.
But UF officials clearly thought this was a serious threat
because they called the bomb squad to investigate. We
agree that students shouldn't be told about every insig-
nificant happening, but officials certainly didn't treat yes-
terday's bomb scare as a mundane occurrence.
We believe the text message alert system should be
used to notify students and faculty of any events that may
affect them. Although the Reitz Union occupies a relative-
ly small physical space, it is one of the most heavily traf-
ficked areas of campus.
Students fund the alert system, which costs about
$33,000 a year, according to Alligator archives. If stu-
dents want to be notified of things like this, administrators
should listen.
The university took the necessary precautions when re-
sponding to the possible threat, but forgot a vital part of
handling an emergency: informing students.

Case against marriage eq
aine voters will go to the polls on Nov. 3 to vote onMaine's Question 1, a referendum that, if passed,
will reject a state law that legalized gay marriage
earlier this year. And through this prism, the refusal of Keith
Bardwell, a Louisiana Justice of the Peace in Tangipahoa
Parish, to sign an interracial couple's marriage license ear-
lier this month becomes a lot more interesting, and not in a
good way.
I know -some people are reluctant to connect the issues
of gay equality and racial equality. But the juxtaposition of
the two stories begs for comparison, and it's worth at least
some examination.
According to an Oct. 15 article in the Hammond Daily
Star, a local paper in the parish, Beth Humphrey, who is
white, and Terence McKay, who is black, called Bardwell
on Oct. 6 to ask if he would sign their marriage license.
Bardwell's wife answered and, toward the end of the call,
asked if theirs was an interracial relationship. Humphrey
said yes and was told that Bardwell doesn't sign licenses for
interracial marriages.
Bardwell insists that he's not a racist, telling the Associ-
ated Press that, while he doesn't "believe in mixing the races
that way," he has "piles and piles of black friends."
"They come to my home, I marry them, they use my
bathroom," he said. "I treat them just like everyone else."
According to Bardwell, the issue is that interracial mar-
riages don't last long, and if such a marriage fails, the chil-
dren from the marriage might have a hard time being ac-
cepted by either side of the family. Neither white society nor
black society readily accepts children of interracial marriag-
es, he said, and he doesn't want the children to suffer.
Bardwell comes across as -and I think this is more or
less objective -a crazy old coot. Don Ellzey, the Hammond
Daily Star reporter, managed to get a quote from Bardwell
in which he says "99 percent" of interracial couples consist
of a white woman and a black man, and he finds that "rath-
er confusing" -a pretty inexplicable quote to give on the
record, but not surprising coming from someone who ap-fl
Joe Dellosa
letters@alligator orgualIity fa ulty
parently thinks the S.I. unit for black
friends is the pile.
The response to Bardwell has been
bipartisan -both Gov. Bobby Jin-
dal, R-La., and Sen. Mary Landrieu,
D-La., are calling for Bardwell's fir-
ing. Ostensibly, we should be able to
dismiss Bardwell as a confused, big-
oted noodle that somehow slipped
through the colander of post-Loving
v. Virginia tolerance.
Except that Bardwell's "think of the children!" tack is be-
ing used, in slightly modified form, in Maine.
The Yes on 1 campaign in Maine has focused its efforts
in trying to scare Maine voters into thinking that the legal-
ization of gay marriage will result not just in the sanctity of
marriage being "destroyed," but also in the "indoctrination"
of school children on the subject of gay marriage.
This is all patently ridiculous, though. Maine Attorney
General Janet Mills released an opinion saying that the gay
marriage law would have no effect on school curricula and
that Maine law provides for "accommodation" in cases
where "course content conflicts with sincerely held religious
beliefs."
And there's no reason to doubt that, even if the subject
of gay marriage were brought up in class, it'd be taught in
an age-appropriate manner -the same way students learn
about other non-traditional families, including those with,
say, interracial parents.
Social change doesn't take place without meaningful
conversations, nor should it. But shameless fear-mongering
-the manipulation of the love and concern people have for
their kids and grandkids -is wrong and mean-spirited. We
can laugh it away when it's old man Bardwell, but for the
couples in Maine whose dignity and love hangs in the bal-
ance of a ballot initiative, it's not really as funny.

Letters to the Editor
Public option strips freedoms
Matthew Christ's Monday column is a
shining beacon of willful ignorance and shal-
low thinking.
Mr. Christ states, "It's a shame that politics
is overtaking this country's best intentions
once again." Imagine that. Politics means
"many views" and reflects the fact that there
are major factions in this country opposed on
deep-seated principles. So he's surprised that
people with opposing principles disagree and
that they won't just -you know -agree al-
ready? Wow, what penetrating insight.
I reject most points of Democratic "health
care reform," including the inclusion of a
public option under the grounds that "you
can either play the game or referee it, but you
can't do both." You can't fairly compete with
private businesses while telling them what
they can and can't do, and all while not wor-
rying about making a profit.
Finally, I reject the notion of health in-
surance as a right. All natural rights require
nothing of your fellow man besides getting
out of the way. The rights to free speech, bear-
ing arms and a fair trial don't require a third
party to bestow upon you a bull horn, rifle
or suit for court. I know it feels really good
inside to "care" about the less fortunate, but
what you're doing is supporting tyranny by
forcefully taking the product of my labor and
giving it to someone else who did not earn it.
Don't be shocked when I don't rush to em-
brace your attempt to strip me of more of my
freedoms and property.
If Mr. Christ's column on Monday was
representative of this generation's thinking, I
weep for the future.

Alligator overreacted to Greek jokes
I understand the fact that many students
did not get the inside jokes about certain
Greek organizations spoken during the Week-
end Update at Gator Growl, but from the edi-
torial "Let the Greeks Growl," the Alligator
seemed very upset by this. I actually thought
that the members of the Alligator would love
this part the most, seeing as they appreciate
any jab taken at the Greek community.
The joke about Delta Upsilon changingtheir Web site to WeRunNothing.com/tran-
nies did not make sense to anyone in the sta-
dium, but more or less everyone just laughed
at the word "trannies," which I'm sure was
insulting to the LGBTQ community. The only
reason that I laughed at this joke was because
of how absurdly ridiculous a statement it was
-like most of the jokes in the segment -but
not because it was true. These jokes about
the Greek organizations on campus were not
meant to be researched for credibility.
One last comment to be made is that while
it is true that many Greeks helped organize
this event, I being one of them, it was not an-
other "Greek social" as the Alligator stated.
It was a well-orchestrated event by all who
were involved, and Matt Sloan deserves rec-
ognition for developing such a great show.
The organizers of Gator Growl knew that the
Greek community represents less than 20 per-
cent of the student body, which is why less
than ten minutes of the three and a half hour
show was dedicated to Greek jokes. I just feel
that the Alligator has overreacted about this
one short segment of an event that is sup-
posed to inspire and entertain all members of
the Gator Nation. Everyone is entitled to their
opinion, don't get me wrong, but remember
that it is called "Gator Growl," not "Alligator
Whine."

Crime not cool in real life
In response to "Jailed Gymnast: Lack of
logic":
Alligatorists, not to play the "race card,"
but the whole rap-thug-$$$-crime-bling-coke-
pimp-crack "culture" has bred this culture of
"crime is cool." And, while it may be excit-
ing in movies, it's terrible for real life and the
youth music culture. Role models?
Not to worry, the courts will probably go
easy on Ms. Sinclair. It will be taken into ac-
count that she made it to college and was a
star athlete. She'll probably get felony proba-
tion (which sucks) and it will put a big dent
in her athletic aspirations.
Hangin' in the hood may be "Kool (and the
Gang)" but it ain't too cool. Do ya feel me?

Unanimous/AnonymousGuest column
Health care not a right,
shouldn't be mandatory
his is in reply to MatthewChrist's column, "Political
gain halts health care re-
form."
"What took the greatest nation on
Earth so long to finally make consid-
erable progress in ensuring univer-
sal health care for its citizens? Why
did Republicans and even moderate
Democrats oppose the idea?"
First, let us put health care where
it belongs. Health care is a service
provided by a health professional
that is then consumed by another
person. To say that health care is a
right basically says that the labor of
another belongs to everyone just be-
cause they exist. Health care is cor-
rectly categorized as a need, along
with housing and food, but by no
means can be considered a right.
Also, considering we live in the
United States of America, let us
consider the Constitution, which
restrains the federal government.
Nowhere in the Constitution does
it allow Congress to regulate health
care. So health care is not a right,
and the Federal Government has no
authority to regulate it.
The legislation proposed would
require that everyone (yes, every-
one) buy a health care plan. In other
words, the federal government
would make you spend your hard-
earned money, whether you want
to or not. And if you don't comply,
you will pay a hefty fine. It always
amazes me that people continue to
propose government as a solution
to our problems. Government didDaniel Morris such a great
Speaking Out job managing
our money
(national
debt), running Social Security
(broke), and running Medicaid and
Medicare, why wouldn't we want
that same government to break into
the health care industry and show
the private sector what real efficien-
cy is all about?
But seriously, there are some
reforms needed in health care. For
one, tort reform would be a great
start in lowering health care costs.
Two, decoupling insurance from
employment would allow indi-
viduals to decide what insurance
provider they wanted and promote
competition between firms.
Three, allowing health insurance
companies to move across state
lines will increase competition so
that free markets and some good
'ole competition will drive down
costs and at the same time increase
the quality of service.
But what are those future people
going to think about us "ancients"
when they discover that we put in-
dividual freedom and the Constitu-
tion before increased government
power? Let me leave you with this
quote:
"The finest opportunity ever giv-
en to the world was thrown away
because the passion for equality
made vain the hope of freedom."

CVS manager admits to taping women in bathroom
* HE HID HIS PHONE IN A
PILE OF TOILET PAPER.
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
kbein@alligator org
A Gainesville CVS Pharmacy
manager was charged with videovoyeurism after he admitted to us-
ing his cell phone to tape women in
the store's bathroom Friday.
Jonathan Matheny, 27, worked
at the CVS Pharmacy located on
Southwest 34th Street and West
University Avenue and told au-
thorities he had captured footage
of about 50 women over the last six
months, according to GPD spokes-man Lt. Keith Kameg.
According to
Local Kameg, police were
News contacted by a
28-year-old victim
who said she became
suspicious when she noticed Ma-
theny leaving the restroom on her
way in.
The victim looked around andfound a recording cell phone hid-
den under a pile of tissues, he said.
The woman confronted Mathe-
ny about the phone, but he denied
knowing anything about it and told
her he'd call the police, Kameg said.
When Matheny hesitated, the
victim called GPD herself.
When police arrived, Matheny
admitted to owning the cell phoneand confessed that he had been re-
cording women for months, Kameg
said.
Matheny's computer and cell
phone have been seized by GPD
and are being examined, he said.
Anyone who thinks she may
have been a victim or may have any
information about this should call
Det. Randy Roberts at 352-334-2470.
Orlando: UF didn't text due to unclear threat
BOMB,from page
this.
"With the terrorist levels the way
they are now, you always have to err
on the side of safety," Moran said.
Though the substance in the bag
turned out to be sand, many stu-
dents expressed frustration over
UF's decision not to send an emer-
gency text message notifying them
of the situation.
UF spokesman
Steve Orlando said
UF didn't send a
mass text because
there wasn't a clear
threat to the cam-
pus.
Orlando "We use that sys-
tem when there's a
credible threat that has the potential
to affect the entire campus," Orlan-
do said.
Monday's situation didn't fit ei-
ther of those criteria, he said.
UF also posted an explanation of
its decision on its Web site.
"It is important to remember
that the campus covers 2,000 acres
and the incident Monday at the Stu-
dent Union involved an area with a
roughly 500-foot radius," the expla-
nation reads.
Other students were a little
peeved they couldn't access their
vehicles in the parking garage.Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF police officer Phil Clary tells a woman she must return to the South side of
Museum Road as she attempts to approach the driveway to the Reitz Union
parking garage Monday.
The garage was shut down from
around 9 a.m. to around 3 p.m.
Aicha Ouzia, a UF German major,
said she had been waiting for three
hours to get to her car.
"I definitely want to go home,"
Ouzia said.
Soon after, police began escorting
people to their vehicles.
Other curious students watched
the scene from the grass across the
street from the union.Justin Brousseau, a UF civil en-
gineering major, said he was killing
time between classes.
"I decided why not just wait
here," Brousseau said.
His girlfriend, though not quite
as interested, was there as well.
"He's my boyfriend and he wants
to sit here, so I'm obliging him," said
Amanda Reilly, a UF electrical engi-
neering major.

The cast of the 23rd season of "The Real World" poses in this promotional photo. Auditions for
the reality TV show will be held today from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Hooters, 3265 SW 34th St.Auditions will be held at Hooters
S HOW , from page 1
ager of the Hooters on Southwest 34th
Street, said she is not permitted to dis-
close exact audition details, but she said
Bunim/Murray Productions did not pay
Hooters for the use of the location.
However, Hunter expects the cast-
ing call to bring increased business even
with about half the restaurant's seating
reserved for auditions.
"We're looking forward to [today's]
events and showing everybody what
we're all about and hopefully getting
one of our locals on the show," Hunter
said.
Everyone waiting to audition will be
offered a Hooters coupon good for the
rest of this week.
"Anyone waiting in line will have
butterflies in their stomach, so they prob-
ably won't be thinking about beer and
wings," she said.
Three Hooters employees are taking
the day off in order to audition, and sev-
eral others hope to have their shifts cov-
ered, too, she said.
Brooke Mulder, a student at Santa Fe
College and a waitress at Hooters, plansto audition after her class.
"I'm not really sure what I'm going to
do," Mulder said. "I'm just going to go in
there and wing it and be myself."
Furberg expects a crowd from any-
where to 200 to 500 people and 15 to 20
of those to receive call-backs tonight.
From there, applicants will have in-
terviews via phone or Web
cam.Local People from GainesvilleN ews and about 75 other cities
can also apply via e-mail,
but Furberg said that although he re-
ceived about 20,000 e-mail applications,
the in-person applicant pool is signifi-
cantly better.
"Just be yourself. Certainly, be the
best image of yourself," Furberg said.
"Don't be hungover or exhausted. Just
have fun."
Furberg pointed out an additional
benefit to Gainesville's casting call loca-
tion.
"I don't know if it's a coincidence, but
we always end up with a cast member
who works at Hooters," he said.

UNEMPLOYMENT, from page 1
nomic times," she wrote in an e-mail.
Out of the 67 counties in Florida, Alachua County
had the fourth-lowest unemployment rate after Lib-
erty, Walton and Monroe counties.
The statewide economic forecast, however, looks
grim. Florida's unemployment rate is 11 percent -
the highest rate since October 1975, when the rate
was also 11 percent. Out of a labor force of 9,193,000,
more than 1 million remain jobless, according to the
report.
Rust said the state's health industry is the only
major industry in the state that is gaining jobs, which
can be attributed to an aging population and the need
for health care.
Other industries aren't doing as well. The con-
struction industry suffered a loss of 14,300 jobs be-
tween August and September.
Mark Rush, an economics professor at UF, said
construction industry's malaise is due to the side ef-
fects of the housing market collapse.
Rush agrees with Rust's assertion that govern-
mental presence has had a profound impact on Ala-
chua County's economic stability. Although he says
he wouldn't be surprised to see the national unem-
ployment rate, which currently sits at 9.5 percent, hit
10 percent, he believes that it will fall below 9 percent
by next year.
"It's no longer a case of 'I've fallen and I can't get
up,"' he said. "It's now a case of 'I've fallen and I'm
starting to get up."'

Ingram earns the highly
prestigious honor of
becoming the first player to
be unanimously voted No.
1 in our alligatorSports
Heisman Watch. The
sophomore rushed for
246 yards in Alabama's
20-6 win over South Carolina this week, and
he has rushed for at least 140 yards in each
of the last three games. Ingram went from
a fringe candidate who received no votes
from any of our panelists a week ago to the
frontrunner.2 1 Jimmy Clausen (12)166.35

age, 14 TD, 2 INT, -49 rushing yards, -1.5 ypc, TD
Clausen and the Irish
couldn't pull it out against
the Trojans this week, but
the junior quarterback
logged a good game,
especially in the second
half. He threw for 260
yards and two touchdowns
and rushed for one more against a solid USC
defense. Still, Clausen saw a significant drop
in his total votes and needed a convoluted
tiebreaker to hold on to his No. 2 spot.
A Jacquizz Rodgers (10) 697 rushing yards, 5.4 ypc, 13 TD, 38
receptions, 269 receiving yards
Like Clausen last week, "Quizz" was off this
week, yet moved up our rankings. Clearly, Kyle
Maistri's push for the speedy running back was
noticed by the other voters. He's no longer the
top running back on our Heisman Watch, but
he has also played one less game than Ingram.
Oregon State takes on USC this week, and if
Rodgers can duplicate the big game (213 yards
from scrimmage, two touchdowns) he had last year in the Beavers'
27-21 upset victory against the Trojans, then he might give Ingram
a run for the top spot next week. Jessica Warshavert/Aligaor StaffMoore has been
extremely consistent for
Boise State, even in a
. pretty unimpressive win
over Tulsa. He threw
for 187 yards and three
touchdowns, while moving
onto our top five for the
second time this season. Moore is one of
three sophomores on our list and one of
two left-handed quarterbacks. As long as
the Broncos stay undefeated, Moore will
continue to be in the mix.
V Tim Tebow (9) 164.63 passer rating, 1,032 yards, 65.5 completion
percentage, 8 TD, 2 INT, 378 rushing yards, 3.8 ypc, 5 TD
Tebow spent the first two weeks atop our rankings
before finally dropping down the list. Back-to-back
mediocre games against LSU and Arkansas have
hurt the only senior on our list. Tebow is running
too often, not finding open receivers often enough
and turning the ball over at a very un-Tebow-like
rate. Still, the Gators are undefeated and No. 15
has been good, but not great.

UF pass game still searching for reliable third option
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@a Iligator org
Finding a go-to receiver without Percy Harvin and Louis I
Murphy hasn't been an issue for Florida this season.
Finding a third option in the passing game has.
So far, tight end Aaron Hernandez and receiver Riley N
Cooper are responsible for 51 of the Gators' 94 completions,
catching 54 percent of quarterback Tim Tebow's passes.
The lack of a third option could cost UF down the road,
though coach Urban Meyer is counting on Deonte Thomp-
son to fill that role. 
-
"Well, Deonte has been hurt, and he would be up there,"
Meyer said. "Of course I would like to see
four guys, and that's typically what we have.
We have to get David Nelson involved more,
and we tried to Saturday. But that's normal.
Football I think every year we have had two or three
guys at the top and then a smattering of oth-
er guys."
Last season, Harvin, Murphy and Hernandez combined
for 112 catches, 53 percent of the team's total receptions.
Hernandez has picked up where he left off, snagging 28
passes for 360 yards and two scores, and he'll surpass his
2008 yardage output with just 22 yards Saturday at Missis-
sippi State.
In Florida's toughest tests of the season, at LSU and
against Arkansas, he has caught 13 passes for 162 yards.
Being the main target was a hard thing to imagine when
Hernandez arrived in 2007 and was surrounded by Har-
vin, Murphy, Andre Caldwell and Cornelius Ingram, all of
whom are in the NFL.
"I never really thought about it," Hernandez said. "I al-
ways wanted it to happen, but I knew the best athletes in

Last season, Florida's frontcourt strug-
gled to stay healthy and faced even more
problems staying in shape.
Through the Gators' opening weekend
of practice, coach Billy Donovan is already
seeing a noticeable change in his big men,
thanks to the preparation of his lone fresh-
man post player.
First-year forward Erik Murphy will
add some much-needed depth to UF's
frontcourt this season, as Donovan ex-
pects the 6-foot-9, 217-pounder to primar-
ily play power forward, occasionally slide
over to center and make an immediate im-
pact down low.

Donovan said. "He is an offensive threat

In the Gators' first weekend of practice,
Murphy's best attribute has been his con-
ditioning -a direct contrast to how UF's
Donovanfreshmen performed
early on last year, when
they couldn't even get
back on defense during
drills.
"I knew that would
be a big help if I came

and was able to run and

Murphy said. "I was in the gym doing
sprints, just working out every day."

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators open practice rusty
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
On edge, a little nervous and maybe even
scared.
Those were the symptoms UF coach Amanda
Butler saw in her new players on Friday when the
women's basketball team had its first day of prac-
tice.
Not the case the second day. The players settled
in, and they showed no signs of first-practice anxi-
ety, but that's not to say the team was flawless.
"We've experienced some of that gladness, and
then we've also experienced a lot of ugly moments
as we start our practice too, which we knew was
going to happen," Butler said.
Part of practice is finding out weaknesses that
don't reveal themselves until players are able to
play for extended periods of time as the season ap-
proaches. With two practices and a morning ses-
sion under the team's belt, passing and rebound-
ing seemed to be the two biggest concerns.
Freshman Tessah Holt remembered a lot of
turnovers in practice.
"They keep how many turnovers each player
has," she said. "The ratio wasn't that great."
The passing and rebounding kinks can be at-
tributed to the mental toll practice takes on players,
in addition to the physical wear and tear.
"Those are the two weaknesses that you'd ex-
pect to see, because they're so overwhelmed with
how much they're trying to take in and learn that
maybe some of these other details get overlooked a
little bit," Butler said.
Butler made clear the coaching staff would not
overlook the finer details.
The team wasn't helped by the absence of se-
nior Jennifer Mossor, who sat out the first practice
because of the flu, practiced partially in the secondsession and participated Monday morning.
Senior Sharielle Smith believed the major-
ity of the team's passing and rebounding hiccups
stemmed from the lack of structure over the sum-
mer. During pickup games, the team doesn't have
coaches around to critique and assess performanc-
es.
"That's all it is right now, just getting into the
habit of having structure, having coaches around,"
Smith said. "I definitely think it's something with-
in the next week we'll be over -that little problem
of lacking the basics and fundamentals."
"Every year, we're supposed to be
building off of what we did the year
before."
Sharielle Smith
UF senior
Looking past the growing pains, Butler was
pleased with select individuals' performance, in-
cluding Ndidi Madu, Jennifer George and Jordan
Jones.
Madu has shown the potential to be a reliable
force in the post this season, and George, a member
of a highly touted freshman class, had strong days
that reflected her physical strength on the inside.
The notion of playing after sitting out a year
has sparked a competitive flame under Jones: the
sophomore transfer hit a game-tying shot in a team
scrimmage in the first practice.
Butler wasn't surprised by the standout in-
dividual performances, but more so the fact that
some of the young players were challenging their
older teammates in practice.
Smith noticed the heightened intensity in the
opening practice versus practices in years past.
"Every year, we're supposed to be building off
of what we did the year before," she said.Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF coach Amanda Butler said she isn't surprised by some of the "ugly mo-
ments" the Gators have had since opening practice on Friday.

shape this summer before coming to Gainesville, and his
efforts have paid off, allowing him to keep up with the
Gators' more experienced players and create a level of
competition that had been absent from UF's practices the
last two years.
As a result, the Gators' returning players have been
forced to improve in practice. Donovan specifically point-
ed out sophomore center Kenny Kadji, one of the freshmen
who struggled to keep up in 2008. Last year, he was one
of many lagging behind. Now, when Kadji can't keep up
with Murphy or UF's other big men, he
gets exposed.
"You need to have competition there.
You need to have guys working," Dono-Men's van said. "You need to have guys who
Basketball can sustain a level of intensity, and that's
the one thing that's been good so far.
"We've had competitive practices because when we
split up the groups as they've been split up, both teams
have been able to compete with each other."
Although Murphy will likely see significant playing
time this year, Donovan compared the freshman to former
Gators forward Matt Bonner in that it could take a few
years for Murphy to fully realize his potential.
"I would say Matt was a little further along on the pe-
rimeter, and Erik is probably a little further along in the
low post than Matt was," Donovan said. "But he's going
to evolve and develop into a very, very good player. I re-
member Matt's freshman year, I don't know how much he
played, but it was a process for him."
Even without the comparison to Bonner, Murphy has
his family's past on his side. His father, Jay, had a four-year
stint in the NBA and played at Boston College, where hecall tell him where to go with it,"
Meyer said. "For example, Deonte
Thompson had a deep defender blow
the coverage, and [Tebow] hit him.
That wasn't made to throw it to De-
onte; the defense dictated that.
"That was the same exact play we
threw to Aaron a few other times on
that bender route. Same exact play.
So it's not, 'Throw it to Aaron.' That's
not how you do it, you read what the
defense is doing."
Erik Murphy came to preseason practice in shape,
which was not the case for UF's frontcourt in '08.
went up against Donovan's Providence team in college.
"I wouldn't say we were close friends, but as we start-
ed recruiting Erik, our relationship got closer during that
process," Donovan said. "It was good to get reacquainted
with him going through that whole process with Erik."BCS Rankings 4 KYLE, from page 16
fensive debacle doesn't fall on Addazio's shoul-
ders, not entirely anyway.
Yes, the play calling continues to be uncre-
ative and predictable.
Yes, Emmanuel Moody and Jeff Demps need
more touches.
And yes, Omarius Hines should get a chance
to show that he can be better than the warm
body that some of the other receivers have been
all season.
But the real problem Saturday was poor ex-
ecution, not game planning.
The Gators fumble four times and Riley
Cooper drops a perfectly thrown deep ball that
would have went for a touchdown.
Blame Addazio!
Tim Tebow holds the ball too long, gets
sacked six times and tucks it and runs 27 times.
Blame Addazio!
The defense lets up uncharacteristically big
plays at crucial moments in the game.
Blame Addazio!
There's plenty that should be blamed on
Addazio, but it's important that his players' lack
of execution doesn't fall on the offensive coordi-
nator's shoulders.
Let's not forget there was a similar public
outcry about the ineptitude of former UF offen-
sive coordinator and current Mississippi State
coach Dan Mullen around this time last season,
right before the team went on a scary-good of-
fensive tear.
I certainly don't believe that will happen
again this year, but let's give Addazio a little
more of a chance to make the necessary adjust-
ments before calling for his head.
Hopefully, he'll be able to identify that Ar-
kansas and coach Bobby Petrino really focused
on taking away the dive play that Addazio
has run about 1.2 X 10A8 times in the last few
weeks.
Perhaps, he can identify that Demps and
Chris Rainey's games are predicated on speed,
and there's no reason the offense can't attack
off-tackle and on the edges with some regularity
in the run game. Bring back the sweep plays that
made the running game so explosive last season,
and maybe even work in a little misdirection if
you really want to get crazy.
Addazio also needs to find a way to put his re-
ceivers in a situation to succeed and make plays,
even if that means taking his Heisman Trophy
winner by the ear and letting him know that 27
runs is an unacceptable number. Keep your eyes
down field and manipulate the pocket, Tim.
The offensive X's and O's haven't been per-
fect -or even very good at times -but it was
100 times better against Arkansas than it was
against LSU.
Sure, Addazio and the offense went back to
a gimmicky end-around play on a third and 1
(though Riley Cooper was not suppose to throw
on that play) just as they did the week before,
but Florida could have scored upwards of 40
points without the aforementioned fumbles and
drops.
Against the Tigers, the Gators were probably
still looking at putting somewhere between 20
and 30 points on the board even if everything
went according to plan because of an embarrass-
ingly conservative scheme designed to control
the clock and lean on the defense.
If the team executes better and Addazio can
make a few small adjustments, then I see no rea-
son why UF can't have a big day against Mul-
len's Bulldogs this weekend.
If not: Blame Addazio!
