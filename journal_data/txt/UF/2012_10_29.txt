 JACKSONVILLE — On Sat-
urday, Florida ﬁ  nally broke.
  The Gators had struck a 
perilous balance in 2012. UF 
rode big plays, good defense and a one-dimensional offense to the No. 2 ranking in the BCS standings and the brink of a Southeastern Conference East-ern Division title.
  However, six turnovers, 
a stagnant offense and yet another slow start were too much for Florida (7-1, 6-1 SEC) to overcome in a 17-9 loss to Georgia (7-1, 5-1 SEC) at Ever-Bank Field.
  Now, instead of pressing 
onward in the national cham-pionship race, the Gators will need help just to play for the SEC title. Florida must defeat Missouri and then hope Geor-gia slips up against either Ole Miss or Auburn.
  “I’ve said all season long: 
We’re not a team that has a lot of margin for error,” UF coach Will Muschamp said. “Six turnovers — wow. That’s tough to overcome.”
  In just one week’s time, UF 
slipped from the driver’s seat to the back seat. 
From “Florida never 
breaks” to “Hotty Toddy” and “War Eagle.”
  “It just comes down to 
the basics,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said. “Football is about taking care of the ball, and we didn’t do that tonight. When you have six turnovers, it’s hard to win any game.”
  The Gators took pride in 
their turnover margin, which stood at plus-11 entering Sat-urday’s game. Despite picking off UGA quarterback Aaron Murray three times, UF lost the turnover battle by three.
  The giveaway onus fell on 
Driskel, who had turned the ball over only twice in his ﬁ  rst seven career starts. Against the Bulldogs, Driskel

�THE ARREST WAS MADE IN    
ALABAMA.

A man accused of being connected to a 
homicide on West University Avenue was 
arrested in Alabama Saturday afternoon.
Clifton Rae Baxter, 33, was arrested on a 
warrant in Dothan, Ala., according to a GPD news release.
The arrest followed a Friday morning 
incident in which a witness reported seeing a man lying facedown on the ground near the Bank of America located at 1116 W. Uni-versity Ave., while another man rummaged through his pockets.
An ambulance rushed the victim to Shands at UF for treatment, where he later died.
Police have not released details regarding 
the man’s death.
Later that day, Gainesville Police released 
several pictures taken at the time of the ho-micide, including one of a white male photo-graphed by an ATM surveillance camera.
A second picture, taken at the same time, 
showed a Chevy Conversion van — police said possibly driven by a white male — parked at a gas station.
GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said detec-
tives have identiﬁ  ed the victim. However, he did not release the man’s name or Baxter’s charges by press time.
Baxter is being held in jail on a $500,000 
bond, but Tobias did not say if he was held in Dothan or brought back to Alachua County.

Early voting started Saturday in Ala-
chua County, and thousands of registered 
voters stood in line in the chilly wind to make sure their voices were heard.
Pam Carpenter, county supervisor of 
elections, said about 4,800 people voted Saturday and about 4,200 voted Sunday.
Early voting lasts until Nov. 3, and 
voters registered in Alachua County can cast their ballots at three locations: the Supervisor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce, County Administration Building Location, 12 SE First St.; the Millhopper Branch Library, 3145 NW 43rd St.; and the Tower Road Branch Library, 3020 SW 75th St.
Carpenter said the turnout was in the 
thousands because voters wanted to take advantage of voting on the weekend.
“The people like to take advantage of 
ﬁ  tting it into their schedule,” she said, “like checking it off the to-do list.”
Early voting is shorter this year, she 
said. Changes in election laws cut down the length from two weeks to eight days.
Carpenter said she saw young people 
in and out of the voting booths all week-end. There was a station wagon shuttling them all day to the downtown voting lo-Early voting brings thousands

Zombie Attack!
Skyler Kern, vice president of Theatre Strike Force, shouts as he runs from other members 
limping along as zombies on the North Lawn during a flash mob on Oct. 28, 2009.
Oct. 31, 1967: Dr. W. J. Coggins, director of the UF Infirmary, warned about 
the possibility of an increase in cases of Asiatic flu that year. After having 
relatively few cases the previous year, he expected an increase due to the flu’s tendency to run in cycles. A mixed vaccine, offered for $1, was recommended for students with chronic diseases, especially respiratory ones.
Oct. 30, 1997: The Division of Housing developed a plan to install fiber 
optic data lines, along with additional phone and cable lines, into the resi-dence halls. The project was expected to cost $3.7 million. The plan came as a result of almost-constant busy signals due to an increase of students and their use of modems. BellSouth representatives said there would continue to be problems because of the increase in traffic on the data lines with all the new Internet users.  
Oct. 28, 2009: As UF tested the UFAlert system — about a month after 
releasing the Emergency Zombie  Attack plan — a horde of zombies limped and moaned its way across campus. UF improv group Theatre Strike Force organized the flash mob, which included about 30 zombies chasing the one human of the group. They wore face paint and tattered clothes, to the amuse-ment of many passers-by. Skyler Kern, vice president of the group, played the human being chased by the zombies. He was devoured outside of Library West.

� TWO MEN FOUGHT DURING THE 
FIRST HALF OF THE GAME.
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Writer
A man was hospitalized and another was arrested following a fight outside EverBank 
Field in Jacksonville during the first half of the Florida-Georgia football game Saturday.
At about 4:45 p.m., witnesses reported 
to Jacksonville law enforcement that a fight broke out between two men at a pond outside the stadium, according to published reports.
A YouTube user posted a video showing a Florida fan, unable to stand, being knocked out by the alleged suspect as they grappled in sev-eral inches of water. Later, the video showed the man pulling the barely conscious Florida fan out of the water. The video has since been removed from the website.
Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman 
Melissa Bujeda told Jacksonville reporters an ambulance took the man to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Police arrested the suspect and booked him into Duval County Jail.
The victim remained in the hospital in sta-
ble condition, according to reports.

The line looked like it never ended.
It snaked from the doors of the book-
filled warehouse down North Main Street, and more literary enthusiasts kept coming to join it.  
A crowd of UF students, Gainesville resi-
dents and booklovers from across the coun-try stood chatting in the cool morning air Sat-urday, waiting for the doors of the Friends of the Library book sale to open.
About 700 people came out Saturday 
for the first 30 minutes of Alachua County Friends of the Library’s biannual book sale, said Peter G. Roode, organization president.
Sarah Harrison, Friends of the Library 
publicity chair, said the sale raised about $80,000 on the first day.
Roode said he couldn’t estimate how 
many people showed up over the weekend for the book sale at 430-B N. Main St., but he said it was easily thousands.
The warehouse, which is slightly bigger than a quarter of a football field, was less crowded than usual. Harrison said the Flor -
ida-Georgia game drew droves of students out of town, which cut down the crowd.
Since the crowd was tamer, patrons had 
room to walk down most of the aisles of books, rather than squeezing through like in previous years.
The sale, which lasts through Wednesday, 
holds about 500,000 items such as books, vid-eotapes and posters.
After the doors opened Saturday, a man 
with a baby slung on his back sifted through books as people around him filled cardboard boxes and grocery bags with items.
Blaine Beck, a UF environmental engi-
neering sophomore, waited in line Saturday morning with his friends. He felt the fistful of coins in his pocket: $3.80 exactly.
“I have a little coin jar, and I raided it,” the 
19-year-old said.
Books can be as little as 25 cents at the 
sale, and cheap prices attract students look-ing for good books.
Janeen Badillo, a UF nursing junior, spot-
ted an old nursing textbook that only cost a few dollars.
“You see this Perry and Potter?” the 
20-year-old asked. “I paid like $100 for that.”
Badillo held on to the textbook, since she’s 
taking a pharmacology class next semester.
Harrison said the sale’s prices are cheaper 
than used bookstores and Amazon.“You can buy, like, 100 books for way, 
way less than retail,” she said.
All profits from the sale go to the Alachua 
County Library District, said Betty Roode, a sale volunteer.Harrison said the book sale is a staple 
Gainesville experience.
“It’s the biggest sale in the Southeast,” she 
said. “We’ve been able to create this kind of very big thing in this very small town.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2012

“I wish I had a million books,” said Lily Mills, 7, before she sat with her brother

Four-year-old Cooper Fox and 
7-year-old Kennedy Fox beamed 
as they slammed their hands onto “oobleck” at Oaks Mall.
The “oobleck,” also known as 
“non-Newtonian fluid,” was one of 15 Halloween-themed science experiments demonstrated at the UF chemistry department’s eighth annual Molecular Mania Saturday.
Event director and associ-
ate professor Adam Viege said hundreds of children and their parents gathered at the mall for Molecular Mania. About 30 un-dergraduate and graduate stu-dents volunteered to perform the experiments.
“As a whole, we do try to con-
nect to the community in different ways,” he said. “It communicates science to the community in a fun and interactive way.”
Sponsored by the chemistry 
department, UF Center for Ca-talysis, the Florida local section of the American Chemical Society and the National Science Founda-tion, Molecular Mania allowed students to explain science to people of all ages, Viege said.
“It challenges them to commu-
nicate pretty high-level science to the general public,” he said.
Viege said Molecular Mania’s 
creative portrayal of chemistry helps capture the attention of children.
“There is real potential to turn 
on the next great scientist at the mall,” he said.
First-year chemistry doc-toral student Candice Ulmer, 21, worked at a station where she su-pervised kids playing with non-Newtonian fluid, a mixture of cornstarch and water that can act as a solid and a liquid simultane-ously.
When Ulmer smacked the pink 
and green substances with Coo-per and Kennedy, it was solid. But when the three lightly touched the surface, they felt a gooey liquid.
Cooper and Kennedy’s mom, 
Jennifer Fox, 33, said she liked how hands-on the experiments were.
“Some people think science 
is boring,” she said. “I think it’s neat for the young kids to come and see the experiments.”
Cooper’s favorite was “Peeps 
in a Vacuum.” His eyes were glued to the glass chamber con-taining about 15 of the colorful marshmallows, which expanded when a vacuum sucked air out and shrank when air came back in.
“I love marshmallows,” he 
said.

Books are cool again.
A study released last week by 
the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project found that more than eight out of 10 Americans between ages 16 and 29 have read a book in the past year.
Kathryn Zickuhr, the study’s 
main author, found that high school-ers and college-aged young adults are especially likely to have read a book or gone to the library.
Ben Walker, head of the Educa-
tion Library at UF, said there has been an 8 percent increase in the education library’s attendance from students since the beginning of the year.“It feels busier,” he said. “I feel 
like our usage is on an uptake.”
The study attributes the increase 
in reading and library attendance to young adults’ interest in “mo-bile technology” like e-readers and smartphones.
“They are convenient to use and 
it’s increased the opportunity for students to view new material,” he said. “And that’s an important thing.”
Richard Freeman, the anthropol-
ogy librarian at Library West for the past seven months, said he heard the results of the study on NPR.
“All I can say is ‘Woo-hoo,’” he 
said.
Freeman said renting e-books is 
becoming more popular at UF.
“There’s a good amount of stu-dents who use them, sometimes it’s all that’s available — especially with academic journals,” he said.
College-aged adults ages 18 to 
24 have the highest overall reading rate of any age group, according to the study . The study found they had an increased interest in e-books and audiobooks as compared with younger readers.
Kristen Heath, 25, a senior clerk 
in the UF admissions office, likes to read her Amazon Kindle outside of Library West.
Heath said she has never rented 
an e-book from the library, but it is something she is considering after hearing about it from her friends.
“I actually prefer print most of 
the time,” she said. “That being said, the e-reader is much more conve-nient because I can carry multiple books at one time, and the books al-ways open to where I left them.”
High school, college students hit booksVote early to avoid lines
cation.
Rachel McGovern, 20, said 
Gators for Obama is providing free rides to the polls each day of early voting.
McGovern, political science 
junior and co-chair of Gators for Obama, said she voted ear -
ly to avoid the long lines that come with Election Day.
Frank Moehrle, 21-year-old 
political science senior and chair of Gators for Romney, said he voted early in Martin County because he wouldn’t have time to go home on Elec-tion Day to vote and said he didn’t want to cast an absen-tee ballot.
Moehrle said he researched 
the ballot ahead of time so he would know who and what he was voting for.
“It is better this way,” he 
said. “That way, you have time to read the ballot instead of making a decision right then and there.”
Carpenter encouraged peo-
ple to take advantage of early voting, especially with this year’s ballot.
She said the ballot is sev-
eral pages long and could take 
about 20 minutes to read.
The bal-
lot includes more than just the 
presiden-tial election. It includes 
other races such as national congressional races, state con-gressional races and County Commission races.
There are also 11 constitu-
tional amendments and two local issues — one regarding the school board and one re-garding county roads. EArly , from page 1“You can buy, like, 100 books for

An Island Flying Fox bat wraps its wings up for a nap at the Lubee Bat Conservatory during the 
eighth annual Florida Bat Festival on Saturday. The conservatory houses more than 200 bats.
� THE FESTIVAL IS THE ONLY TIME 
WHEN THE PUBLIC IS ALLOWED INTO THE CONSERVANCY. TATILA BROCK
Alligator Contributing Writer
A bat hung from the cage ceiling, 
snatching fruit from pumpkin sculptures 
as admirers stared from below.
About 2,500 people attended the Lubee 
Bat Conservancy’s eighth annual Florida Bat Festival Saturday. 
The festival is the only time of year 
when the public is allowed inside, said Brian Pope, director of the conservancy.
The conservancy, located at 1309 NW 
192nd Ave., is home to 207 bats, Pope said. The species ranged from fruit bats to the largest species in the world, the Ma-layan bat, which has a 6-foot wingspan.
Visitors looked at tables set up by 26 
vendors, ranging from merchandise to animals such as greyhounds, snakes and iguanas, which visitors could pet.Kitty Lane, a 48-year-old Jacksonville 
resident, came to the festival with her family.
Lane, a Florida Invasive Plant Educa-
tion Initiative and Curriculum employee, said the most interesting display was a diorama that let kids compare their arm length with the wingspan of the world’s largest bat.
Kaden Keith, 3, and his family wore 
Batman shirts to the conservancy.
Kaden, who plans to be Batman for 
Halloween, said he liked learning about the winged creatures. But he really liked the games.
“I won a bat book,” Kaden said. “I 
threw the ball into the cup and got one in.”
Pope said the conservancy includes 
family-friendly activities to teach people everyone can know about bats, not just scientists.
“One of the main goals is to connect 
with the local community,” he said. “We want people to come out with their fami-lies, have a good time and learn about bats.”Conservancy draws 2,500

116 TOTAL VOTESFriday’s question: Are you excited for 
this weekend?Freaky 
Frankenstorm  
We’ve seen worse, 
but they haven’t Apparently the East Coast of the United States is about to 
get completely wiped off the face of the earth.
This past weekend, Northerners spent time in bo-
degas and grocery stores getting prepared for the oncoming storm.
Even Kim Kardashian bought a cartload of bottled water. 
But also, she only bought bottled water. Is that all she needs to survive?
Let us put some things into perspective for you, just in case 
you think Hurricane Sandy is going to decimate anything: It’s a Category 1 storm. It is one cat. One cat is not really that much to handle. It needs a little bit of attention and some cuddling every now and then, and then it’s good to go. 
The worst hurricane to hit Florida in recent history was Hur-
ricane Andrew. This hit our coast in 1992. Andrew was a Cat-egory 4 (or 5) storm. That is four or ﬁ  ve cats. Do you know how much of a problem ﬁ  ve cats can be?
First of all, there will be poop everywhere, no matter what 
those kitty-litter commercials try to tell you. Imagine trying to share one toilet with ﬁ  ve other people; that’s not a pretty situ-ation. Then you have to worry about feeding all of those cats. We’d assume it would take a lot of fuel and energy to keep that many cats going strong.
In Andrew’s case, it cost about $26.5 billion. That’s a lot of cat-
nip. Or fun toys that have feathers on them. Or treats for when they do something in a really cute way. You know, cat stuff.
To be fair, states like New York and New Jersey don’t nor-
mally see a storm of this size. They aren’t as well prepared for them as Floridians are taught to be.
Northern cities started to evacuate some residents as the 
storm approaches. Nearly 80,000 people who live in Delaware and Atlantic City , N.J., were asked to leave their homes. 
Sandy will most likely make landfall sometime tonight or ear-
ly tomorrow morning. Also, this storm has already killed more than 60 people in the Caribbean. A majority of those deaths took place in Haiti, a country still recovering from the last round of strong storms.
While it’s always important to prepare ourselves for an im-
pending emergency situation, we should deﬁ  nitely remember that we are not the only ones affected. However, Sandy has the potential to collide with a polar front coming down from the Arctic. That’s why some people are calling that combination of storms a “Frankenstorm.” It’s one-part hurricane plus one-part Arctic front plus one-part full moon. That means it’s an unusual situation; crazy winds and rains mixed with high tides do not make a safe week. “Frankenstorm” is also happening on the week of Halloween, which is super spooky.
Did you hear about the earthquakes and tsunami warnings 
over on the West Coast this weekend? Basically, we’re starting to see that the world really will end in 2012.
Let’s make it a good last few months, folks.
Exploration, mythology, elephants and art
Much like Snooki from the popular TV program “Jer-
sey Shore,” I often ﬁ  nd myself reﬂ  ecting on the functional reality of art.
What is art’s purpose in the physiological world?We as a race have an adventurous streak. We have gone 
to the very extremes of our world in search of answers — to the top of Everest, the deepest reaches of the rainforest, the North and South poles — and have been left wanting.
Is art our last great adventuring — our exploration of the 
world of humanity’s collective subconscious mind? Answer-ing this question would require a rigorous discourse cover-ing thousands of years of human history and development, so instead, let’s just talk about something fun like elephants.
Did I ever tell you the story about the blind men and the 
elephant? Well, like, there was this great big elephant and these four blind guys were wandering around the forest when they ran into it (the blind guys were in the forest be-cause they were trying to go to Fest, but they took a wrong turn somewhere or something).
One of them grabbed the trunk and said, “Crap! A snake!” 
One of them felt the leg and said, “No, idiot, it’s an oak tree!” One of them touched the point of the tusk and said, “Dum-mkopf! It’s the French Foreign Legion! Here’s the end of one of their bayonets!” The last one didn’t say anything because all these guys in the elephant’s Kool-Aid startled it, so it stomped him to death. 
I told this story to illustrate a very important point: El-
ephants are dangerous.
You should never grab an elephant’s trunk because then 
they will start losing their minds and ﬂ  ailing all around.
But how do we know that? Probably because somebody 
a very long time ago, around the time of the discovery of el-ephants, tried it. He grabbed the elephant’s trunk and then a few days later, they found his mangled body in a footprint (reminds me of that “The Far Side” cartoon with the “Thago-mizer, named after the late Thag Simmons”).
So ever since then, it’s been transmitted to us through ar-
tistic representations of people grabbing elephant’s trunks that this is a bad thing to do. So, is that the purpose of art, or is it just another red herring?Correlation does not imply cau-
sality: Just because life often imi-tates art (which is itself imitating life), that does not mean that art’s original purpose was to pass along important messages concerning the very survival of the human race.
We need more evidence than 
just some story I made up about 
blind men and elephants and people getting trampled to conclude something heavy like that.
So let’s analyze mythology, the very basis of Western art.Mythology’s purpose is twofold (no, providing characters 
for Disney to make into action ﬁ  gures is not one).
These are: providing lessons on the “right” way to live 
(as determined arbitrarily by some drunk Greek guys a long time ago) and explaining the way the world came to be the way it is.
A great myth that illustrates the ﬁ  rst purpose is that of 
Baucis and Philemon: Two old people were visited by weary travelers just asking for some good down-home cooking and a place to sleep, so B&P obliged.
Well, it turns out that the “weary travelers” were really 
Zeus and Hermes in disguise, and so they rewarded Baucis and Philemon by turning them into intertwined trees for eternity.
More often, though, we see mythological tales ﬁ  lled with 
warnings like, “Don’t feed your twin brother his own sons” and “Don’t let your wife have sex with a bull.”  What does this have to do with art?
In art, we see the disobeying of many core traditions, if 
only because the artist wants to explore what happens when our fundamental cores break down.
And it usually turns out badly, like it did for the fourth 
blind man in our earlier story.
So, what can we conclude? Why , my friend, that is for you 
to decide. I’m still recovering from Fest.

In 1987, science fiction became reality. 
In this reality, what exactly constituted “food” 
changed, and consumers have since been left in the 
dark about what they eat.
As the world watches and waits for the results of 
the 2012 presidential election, Proposition 37 in Cali-
fornia, which would mandate the labeling of geneti-cally modified organisms, has been largely ignored.
A quick rundown of statistics is startling: 85 per -
cent of U.S. corn, 90 percent of canola, 88 percent of cotton and 94 percent of soy are genetically modi-fied. This results in a supermarket where more than 70 percent of the products contain GMOs.
That statistic is worth repeating: More than 70 
percent of foods in the United States are genetically modified. The future has arrived, and it is all around us.
The science fiction began at Calgene, a biotech 
firm now owned by Monsanto, whose scientists opened the door to a new food and agricultural revo-lution. The Green Revolution of the 1950s and 1960s increased crop yields and expanded the industrial-
ized food system, fundamen-tally changing food at the mo-lecular level.
Calgene created the Flavr 
Savr tomato, the first com-
mercial GMO. This tomato unleashed a wave of ge-netic modification that has resulted in a food system dominated by GMOs.
GMOs have been designed to resist pesticides 
sprayed on fields — ironically allowing more to be sprayed — have longer shelf lives, are more toler -
ant to stress and even contain pesticides within the plants themselves.
The benefit has been unparalleled food produc-
tion in the U.S. The costs are an uncertain future of food and unintended consequences for both humans and the environment.
While there must be a separate argument about 
the effects of GMOs in relation to intellectual prop-erty, seed prices, health and the potential to form su-perweeds (which has already occurred), the discus-sion facing voters is far simpler.
If we understand food as a fundamental right to 
all people, the right to know what is in our food must also be accepted.
Fifty countries around the world, including Ja-
pan, India and China, already require the labeling of GMOs, and many of these countries restrict their use. The development of GMOs has the potential to be one of the greatest technological advances in food and agriculture in the 21st century.
However, the greatest problem regarding GMOs 
has been transparency. Monsanto and other large companies conduct their own studies on GMOs, lim-it the distribution of their data and results (because it is “proprietary”) and are ultimately left to regu-late themselves. Large companies such as Monsan-to, DuPont Co., Dow AgroSciences LLC, Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Kellogg Co. and General Mills Inc. have combined to raise $47 million to fight Proposi-tion 37.
The adage “you are what you eat” has taken on an 
entirely new meaning in the age of GMOs, and it is essential that products be labeled so that consumers know what exactly is in them. It is their right.

UWireLast week, the Alligator printed a story regarding 
a group of concerned citizens who were opposed to the construction of a new nuclear power plant 
in Levy County. 
The article quoted former Gainesville mayor Tom 
Bussing saying that the plant would be “an environ-
mental disaster.” As a nuclear engineering student, reading that statement shocked me and revealed to me that a factual and comprehensive conversation is needed about the merits and disadvantages of nuclear energy in our community.
To begin, it is important to understand that energy is 
an issue that affects us all; the energy we use when we 
flip a light switch on has to come from somewhere. The brilliance of engineering has allowed us to harness the energy we find on Earth and transform it into forms we can use in our everyday lives. The greatest issue with energy today is how to reconcile affordable energy with environmental stewardship.
Affordability is important because energy has be-
come an indispensable part of our lives; having high energy prices can cripple a struggling household or slow the overall economic growth in our state and in our country. 
Along with affordability is a concept known to en-
ergy engineers as the capacity factor, or the percentage of the time a specific form of energy is available for use. An energy source that has a capacity factor of 30 percent is like having a car that starts only about 30 percent of the time. Together, the capacity factor and the costs of transforming the energy determine how affordable our energy is.
The greatest tool to compare energy sources is the 
U.S. Energy Information Administration’s annual re-port. 
The immediate conclusion I drew from the data pre-
sented was that no energy source is perfect. 
Cheap and reliable energies usually come at heavier 
environmental impacts. Pure, renewable, clean energies — like wind, solar and geothermal — tend to be expen-sive, unreliable and rare.
The argument for nuclear energy comes from the fact 
that it is a carbon-dioxide-emission-free energy source.  Nuclear is a clean-air energy that is designed to release only steam into the atmosphere. Nuclear energy is also cheap and competitive and allows us to power our homes without breaking the piggy bank, while boast-ing a 90 percent capacity factor — one of the highest among the readily available pow-er sources. 
Nuclear fuel is also extremely 
energy-dense, maximizing the amount of fuel created from the amount of material given — an 
incredible asset to its environmental benefits. According to the Energy Information Center website, nuclear waste is so dense that if you piled all of the used fuel gener -
ated from all of the power plants in the United States in the past 60 years, we could fit it all on a football field.
Used nuclear fuel and facilities are kept safe, con-
trolled and regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which enforces strict safety standards for all nuclear facilities and keeps them running like new yearlong. The agency ensures that nuclear facilities are complying with all environmental standards, keeping our resources clean and safeguarded before any plant can operate.
All things considered, nuclear energy supports envi-
ronmental stewardship and affordable energy. It gives us the ability to power our homes without emitting harmful gases into the air while safely controlling the used fuel by-product. 
Instead of fighting new initiatives for nuclear energy, 
we should focus on solving the real problems that pre-vent us from taking full use of the environmental bene-fits nuclear energy brings. Problems such as the political issues behind creating a nuclear fuel repository to safely house our waste and changing the policy that prevents recycling of used nuclear fuel should be our main con-cerns to address the environmental issues surrounding nuclear energy.
There is no clear answer to what the perfect energy 
source is for us right now. 
If there is anything to take away from the data I have 
presented, it is that it’s important to keep a strong mix of energy sources to maintain affordability and promote environmental stewardship. 
When analyzing the availability of our energy, it 
is important to consider the playing field and what is at stake, make pragmatic decisions, and not allow our good intentions to lead us down the wrong path for lack of knowledge or perspective.

Speaking OutMICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON

Illegally loud music, skintight 
fashion and the ever-present scent 
of Pabst Blue Ribbon invaded the streets of Gainesville this weekend.
With Gator fans flocking to Jack-
sonville for Florida football, about 8,000 self-proclaimed punks were expected to infiltrate downtown.
By noon Friday , the volunteer 
check-in line for Fest 11, a three-day Gainesville punk rock music festival, snaked across the Holiday Inn Gainesville University Center’s parking lot, up the building’s stairs and into the second-floor festival flea market.
Most of the festival’s 360 bands 
had made the hotel their home for the weekend. Attendees without the money or luck to get a hotel room slept in cars, strangers’ houses and wooded areas in the city . 
Many went without the luxury of 
a shower or a change of clothes.
Lack of hygiene aside, it was 
one of the punk community’s most-coveted weekends, with about 4,000 passes sold.
At a pool party on the hotel’s 
third floor, 22-year-old Fest volun-teer Derek Durham fished a Pall Mall menthol from his pocket. It was his fifth year at the festival and first volunteering as a stage manager.
He had driven from Tallahas-
see in his ‘98 Camry with only the clothes he was wearing and a pair of cutoff shorts, socks and some old Fest shirts in the back seat.
“I wouldn’t miss this for any-
thing,” he said. “Christmas? Forget that.”
Near the pool’s stage, fans crowd 
surfed through a sea of neon-colored hair, studded denim jackets and cig-arette smoke.
A white-haired police officer cast a wary eye on the crowd. He stood guard at the pool’s door. No wrist-band, no entrance.
Strangers shouted “Happy Fest!” 
to each other as they funneled malt beer in parking lots. Audience mem-bers rushed to help fallen crowd surfers. Homeowners opened their doors and backyards so Festers didn’t have to sleep in their cars.
“You may pass over them as just 
crazy people — they’re punks,” Durham said. “But in all reality , they’re just people, just like you and I and everybody else, that like hard-core music and living the alternative lifestyle.”  
In their hometowns, Festers 
might be in the minority . But on Halloween weekend, Gainesville belongs to punk rock, progressivism and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer.
Festers wander up and down 
West University Avenue in PBR T-shirts, sipping $1 PBR tall boys from pink PBR koozies and carry-ing 12-packs of PBR in blue PBR tote bags.
Although the corporate-spon-
sored festival fills 13 downtown venues, most UF students would be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of names they recognize.
“A very small percentage of 
bands do this for a living,“ Durham said. “There’s not enough money in punk rock to sustain yourself.”
Tanner Jones, 22-year-old gui-
tarist for Orlando-based band You Blew It!, agreed.
“Fest is a gathering of friends in-
stead of a collection of shows,” he said. “You come here, and you meet bands, and you meet friends.”
The days were marathons of 
drinking, walking and dancing that could last until 5 a.m., only to restart three hours later. Pizza slices, nachos and vegan hot dogs fueled Festers between shows.
“I’ve been on this road 48 hours 
straight, zero naps,” Durham said as he searched for his friends on West University Avenue Friday night. “I need my naps.”
The shows didn’t end when the 
bars closed. Some Gainesville resi-dents hosted late-night performanc-es at their houses, and Festers traded addresses by word-of-mouth, text message and Twitter.
At about 2 a.m. Sunday , about 
400 people huddled behind a stor -
age warehouse north of Gainesville. Underneath the yellow glow of two street lamps, You Blew It! played a set powered by a gas generator.
The band and two other groups 
played for about an hour before two police cruisers pulled around the side of the building.
“Leave, or I will start arresting 
people,” an officer shouted from the cruiser’s PA system.
Festers swarmed past the cars. 
They weren’t afraid of being ar -
rested; it’s how the party ends ev-ery year. Besides, there were more shows Sunday afternoon.
In the power struggle between 
punks and police at Fest, there were no clear winners.
An unsanctioned show would 
be shut down, only for another to spring up in a hotel room or garage across town. When a fragmented community assembles, it’s hard to shut down the music for long.
As Festers pulled away from the 
warehouse, being corralled back into the city, the crisp sound of cym-bals could be heard for a few min-utes longer.
The beat rang out in the still Oc-
tober night: constant, powerful, defi-ant.

�ASSIGNED SEATING LAST 
OCCURRED IN 2009.
CHRIS KIRSCHNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Seating will be assigned at this 
year’s Gator Growl on Nov. 9.
Gator Growl staff members wrote 
in a press release issued Friday that 
all tickets — not just those of alumni and the general public, like in previ-ous years — will be accompanied by assigned seats. Students have not been assigned seating since 2009, said Gator Growl producer Saman-tha Hockenberry.
Hockenberry said change was 
needed because many audience members gave negative feedback after last year’s event. She said some students would end up sitting in seats assigned to alumni or other au-dience members, inconveniencing everyone involved.“People now don’t have to search 
for a seat,” Hockenberry said. “They can now go in whenever they would like and just enjoy the show.”
The staff also decided to hire UF 
ROTC members to usher students to their correct seats, Hockenberry said. The ushers will not be paid, but organizers will donate $1,500 to the ROTC program.
Students wanting to sit with their 
friends must pick up their tickets to-gether, Hockenberry said. Student organizations have the option to be placed in block seating, just like at football games.
Alex Herndon, a 19-year-old 
recreation and event management sophomore, said assigned seating could help students who cannot get to the event early.
“The stadium will not be as cha-
otic anymore with people trying to find seats,” she said. “It will just be a much more enjoyable experience.”Gator Growl seats will

Dexter Veige and his brother, 
Fletcher, sprawled out on a blan-
ket on Flavet Field Sunday night, eating Lunchables and waiting for Swamp Symphony to start.
Soon, UF’s Jazz Band came 
onstage to kick off the event. Dexter, 3, threw down his Skit-tles and started dancing to the swing music, his 4-year-old brother following suit.
Swamp Symphony, put on 
by Gator Growl and UF Home-coming, featured UF Fine Arts performance groups, said direc-tor Michael Levey.
“We want to showcase the 
Fine Arts department because it’s so great at UF,” the 19-year-old telecommunication sopho-more said.
The UF Jazz Band, Sym-
phony Orchestra, Men’s Glee Club, Gospel Choir, University Concert Choir and Agbedidi Af-rica performed on Flavet Field’s stage.
Seven Homecoming Educa-tion Celebration awards were given to faculty and staff mem-bers in between the groups.
Judy Page, an English profes-
sor and director of the Center for Women’s Studies and Gen-der Research, won the 2012 Out-standing Faculty Award.
The Morrill Act Award went 
to Department of Agricultural Education and Communica-tion professor Kirby Barrick, the Family Album Radio, and the faculty of the Department of Mi-crobiology and Cell Science.
Dexter’s and Fletcher’s fa-
ther, chemistry professor Adam Veige, won the 2012 Outstand-ing Mentor of Undergraduate Research Award, along with physics professor Amlan Biswas and interior design professor Maruja Torres-Antonini.
“It’s really an honor to re-
ceive this award,” Torres-An-tonini said, holding the hand of her 18-month-old granddaugh-ter, Tabitha, who spent her night running up and down the field in sync with the swells of the or -
chestra.“She kept us warm,” Torres-
Antonini said, referencing the night’s temperatures, which hovered in the 60s.
Audience members wrapped 
themselves in blankets and stuffed their hands into coat pockets as the temperature dropped with the sun.
Tucked in a hoodie and 
armed with a box of Cheez-Its, 18-year-old pre-pharmacy fresh-man Janelle Roberts shivered to the drumbeats of Agbedidi Africa. She heard the orchestra rehearsing earlier in the day and decided to come back to see the show.
“They’re all really talented,” 
she said.
Behind Roberts, the dean of 
the College of Fine Arts, Lucin-da Lavelli, huddled in a Gators blanket.
Roberts flew in early this 
morning from a conference in Minneapolis to make the sym-phony.
“It’s so exciting to see the per -
formers and hear the music on this wonderful field,” she said, adding that she was happy the audience toughed it out through the cold snap. “We can say the arts warmed us up.”

Will Florida win the Southeastern Conference East despite losing to 
Georgia on Saturday? Vote online at alligatorSports.org. Florida-Missouri Start Time Set

Coach Will Muschamp speaks to the media after Florida’s 17-9 loss to Georgia on Saturday 
at EverBank Field in Jacksonville. UF dropped to No. 7 in the BCS standings on Sunday. 
 �UF FALLS TO NO. 8 IN AP POLL. 
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
  
  JACKSONVILLE — After knocking off 
the Gators for the second year in a row, 
Georgia leapfrogged Florida in the BCS standings. 
  UF dropped from No. 2 to No. 7 in the 
BCS poll and from No. 3 to No. 8 in the AP poll. 
  Georgia moved up to sixth in the BCS 
and No. 7 in the AP . 
  The Gators can only reach the Southeast-
ern Conference title game for the ﬁ  rst time since 2009 if they defeat Missouri and Geor-gia loses at home to Ole Miss or on the road against Auburn. 
  With four of the top 10 teams in the BCS 
falling, the Gators stayed in contention for a potential BCS national championship game appearance.
  Alabama, Kansas State, Notre Dame, Or-
egon, LSU and Georgia are ahead of Florida in the BCS.
  All six teams have games remaining 
against ranked opponents.
  Even if Georgia wins out to keep Florida 
from an SEC title shot, Florida could still win the rest of its games and have an outside shot at a BCS title game appearance. 
  Kansas State, Oregon and Notre Dame would all need to lose at least once, while the winner of Saturday’s matchup between LSU and Alabama would need to defeat Georgia in the SEC title game. Florida could then theoretically be selected to face that team for the national title. 
  Even with its No. 7 ranking, Florida 
would qualify for a BCS bowl game appear-ance. The Sugar Bowl takes the SEC cham-pion and an at-large team. 
  If the SEC champion reaches the national 
title game, the Sugar Bowl selects the next highest-ranked SEC team in the BCS.
  The Capital One Bowl pits the SEC No. 2 
against the No. 2 team from the Big Ten.
  
  Gillislee slowing down: Mike Gillislee 
didn’t have much room to run against the Bulldogs.
  Georgia’s three starters on the defensive 
line, anchored by 6-foot-3, 358-pound John Jenkins and 6-foot-6, 355-pound Kwame Geathers, weigh an average of 337 pounds.
  Florida’s offense entered the game with 
the SEC’s third-ranked rushing offense.
  Something had to give.  Unfortunately for Florida, Gillislee and 
Co. ran into a brick wall.
  “They loaded the box and did a good job 
stopping the run,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said. “That’s what they said from the begin-ning, that they were going to stop the run, and they did that pretty much all night. Florida drops to No. 7 in BCS standings after loss to Georgia 
  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 JACKSONVILLE — As Florida sat 
in the locker room on Saturday fol-
lowing its ﬁ  rst loss of the season, no one pointed the ﬁ  nger. 
  Instead of moping after Satur-
day’s 17-9 loss to Georgia, UF’s lead-ers stepped up to address the team. Jeff Driskel, Xavier Nixon, Jon Hala-pio, Mike Gillislee, Lerentee McCray, Sharrif Floyd, Jelani Jenkins, Jon Bos-tic and others spoke after the game. 
  “The biggest difference between 
this year’s team and last year’s team: We’re actually pulling together dur-ing this adversity,” Halapio said. “We’re not pointing ﬁ  ngers at each other. We’re not blaming this person for losing the game or this person. … That’s the big difference I see from a maturity standpoint of this team this year versus last year.”
  Coach Will Muschamp also ad-
dressed his players. 
  “You’ve won well together,” Mus-champ said. “Now we’re going to ﬁ  nd out how we handle adversity.”
  With four games left to play, the 
one-loss Gators still have a chance to contend for a BCS bowl. 
  One slip-up by Georgia puts UF 
back in the SEC championship game. 
  “There’s a lot of football to play,” 
Muschamp said. “We’ve got to move forward.”
  Said Halapio: “It’s just a team 
mentality that we’ve got to pull to-gether. We can’t let anymore oppor-tunity slip.”
  Florida’s defense did its part on 
Saturday, forcing three turnovers while holding Georgia to 273 yards  Tougher UF pulling togetherJURNY DUTY

A heavy coat of makeup can mask even the worst blemishes.
  For Florida, that makeup was 
a perfect record, and on Saturday, all the mascara dripped off.
  Prior to its 17-9 loss to Georgia, Florida 
ranked last in the Southeastern Conference in passing, but it hadn’t mattered
  The Gators were second-to-last in the 
league in penalties. It hadn’t mattered.
  They were outgained in the ﬁ  rst quarter 
in each of their ﬁ  rst seven games. It hadn’t mattered.
  But the superb ball security and strong 
second-half adjustments that Florida had displayed all season weren’t there against Georgia, so everything mattered.
  After every game UF won by grinding it 
out on the ground and doing little through the air, the prevailing sentiment was the Gators didn’t have to throw the ball but could if they needed to.
  Saturday’s loss proved that the back end 
of that equation was wrong.
  Thanks to South Carolina giving the ball 
away repeatedly last week, it didn’t matter that the Gators were held to a season-low 89 yards rushing. But the Gators couldn’t respond sufﬁ  cient-ly through the air when the Bulldogs clamped down even more, limiting Florida to 81 yards on the ground.
  “I don’t think 
we ran the ball well 
enough,” coach Will Muschamp said. “When you become one-dimensional against really good rushers, you know, Jarvis (Jones) is a really good rusher. We had to chip him and do some things, but you can’t limit your-self in the passing game every single snap in order to chip the guy. When you become one-dimensional, it’s hard. It puts a lot of pressure on [Jeff Driskel].”
  The passing problem is a byproduct of 
the continued ﬁ  rst-half offensive struggles. For the eighth straight game, the Gators were outgained in the ﬁ  rst quarter, this time by a margin of 88-26. They had been win-ning because the run game kept breaking out later in games, but that didn’t happen on Saturday.
The slow starts are a   problem that won’t 
go away. The issue didn’t cost Florida when Gators’ faults culminate in loss

“The biggest difference

last year’s team: We’re actu-

adversity.”

Linebacker Neiron Ball (11) returns an interception thrown by Georgia’s Aaron 
Murray during the first quarter of UF’s 17-9 loss on Saturday at EverBank Field.
Florida defense strong in defeat
of total offense. 
Even as UF’s offense 
turned the ball over six times 
and consistently set Georgia up with extra possessions in prime field position, the de-fense yielded only 17 points. 
“The defense did a great 
job of giving us opportuni-ties,” Driskel said. “When you have a defense like we do, you can’t turn the ball over. They’re going to make stops. You can’t force things. You’ve just got to take points, and there were a couple of times there where we took points off the board and put our defense in tough spots.”
Said cornerback Jaylen 
Watkins: “We look at it as a challenge for the defense. For us, it’s fun. It’s obviously not fun turning the ball over, but we get excited because that’s one of the challenges we like to face, just getting our of-fense back the ball. We did it a few times, but sometimes we didn’t hold up.”
A large chunk of Geor -
gia’s damage was due to one mistake: Loucheiz Purifoy’s 
m i s s e d tackle after M a l c o l m M i t c h e l l secured a catch on a curl route that led to 
a 45-yard 
touchdown midway through the fourth quarter.  
“We were in position,” 
Muschamp said. “We were in position to make it, and they made the play and we didn’t. Frustrating, but at the end of the day you’ve got to make those plays.”
Although Georgia running 
back Todd Gurley amassed 118 yards and gashed the Gators in spurts, Florida forced quarterback Aaron Murray to tie a career high with three interceptions.
Still, Florida wound up on 
the losing end. To Watkins, the loss is a sign the defense didn’t play well enough. 
“We lost, so I don’t think 
it was (good enough),” Wat-kins said. “The object is to keep them at zero points, and we didn’t do that.”
That sense of accountabili-
ty wasn’t a staple of Florida’s 2011 team. 
It’s a major reason why 
the Gators aren’t pointing fingers in the locker room, and why they’re ready to re-group. 
“We have good leader -
ship on our football team and we’ll be fine in the long run,” Muschamp said. 
“We just need to push 
through this.”

gluca@alligator.org.it dominated teams in the second half 
and wasn’t forced to play from be-hind. But any team that gets a lead on the Gators late doesn’t fear a come-back via the passing game.
Florida hindered its comeback ef-
forts with 10 costly penalties, which included inexplicably getting caught with 12 men on the field twice. 
Although Florida had extended 
an opponent’s scoring drive with a third- or fourth-down penalty five previous times this season, they all pale in comparison to Dominique Ea-sley’s biggest mistake on Saturday. 
Easley sniffed out a third-down 
screen pass deep in Bulldogs territory in the fourth quarter but was called for defensive holding after wrapping up running back Todd Gurley before the pass arrived.
The Bulldogs would score the 
game’s final touchdown later in the drive.
The Gators committed six turn-
overs, and that was the biggest rea-son for the defeat. But the loss high-lights that UF’s other flaws aren’t close to being solved. Florida could have clinched the SEC East even with the turnovers if the underlying issues from its first seven games had been adequately addressed before Satur -
day.
They weren’t. More problems 
arose. And because of it, Georgia now has the easier road to Atlanta.

DEFENSE
from page 13JOSH , from page 13Gillislee, run game sputtering
We just came short. We didn’t make enough 
plays.”
After racking up a career-high 34 carries for 
146 yards against then-No. 4 LSU, Gillislee has averaged 19 carries and 60 yards in the past three games.
The Georgia defense that allowed 206 rush-
ing yards to SEC cellar-dweller Kentucky on Oct. 20 looked much stronger on Saturday at EverBank Field.
Florida managed a season-low 75 yards on 
the ground.
“We didn’t run the ball well enough,” Mus-
champ said. “We became one-dimensional against really good rushers.”
Right guard Jon Halapio said the Gators of-
fensive line had trouble communicating and timing the snap.
“There are little parts of it that can be blamed 
on us, but like I said earlier, it’s a team effort,” Halapio said. “Not one particular possession or one person on the team lost the football game.”
Bulldogs rough up Gators: Solomon Patton 
suffered a broken left arm in Saturday’s loss. 
Patton took a sweep and ran left on a fourth-
and-1 play at the Georgia 36-yard line. 
Georgia safety Shawn Williams grabbed 
the 5-foot-9 Patton up around his shoulder pads and slammed the receiver down on his arm.
Patton left the game and did not return. He 
watched the second half from the sidelines with his arm in a sling. 
Defensive tackle Damien Jacobs didn’t 
travel with the team due to a hamstring inju-ry . Linebacker Jelani Jenkins started the game before tweaking his hamstring, which Jenkins originally injured against LSU on Oct. 6.

The Gators finished 18 holes on 
Sunday at the Betsy Rawls Long-
horn Invite with a 5-over 293. 
No. 6 UF took the course in 
Austin, Texas, for its final event of the fall season against a field that includes nine teams in Golfweek’s Top 50. Florida sits in fourth place, nine strokes behind tournament leader Alabama, which shot a 284 (-4).
“Everyone did a good job of 
staying patient during a cold and breezy day,” coach Emily Bastel said. “Overall, we had a good day. We did a pretty good job of manag-ing our way around the course. To-morrow, we are looking for a few more puts to drop and to improve on the mistakes we made today.”
The efforts of sophomore Ca-
milla Hedberg, Isabelle Lendl and Mia Piccio fueled the Gators’ per -
formance.  
Hedberg posted Florida’s lone 
under-par score in the first round. She started the day strong, with birdies on holes 2 and 4. Hedberg bogeyed holes 13 and 17 but would finish with a 71 (-1).
She is currently tied for fifth.Seniors Mia Piccio and Isabelle 
Lendl both finished the first round at 73 (+1).
Lendl shot a balanced round 
before bogeying hole 13 to finish 1-over. The Goshen, Conn., native is coming off two consecutive first-place finishes at  the Dale McNa-mara Invitational and the Tar Heel Invitational. 
Piccio began the round strong 
with three birdies on the front nine, putting her 2-under. On the 
back nine, Pic-cio carded three bogeys to finish 1-over. Sunday marked Piccio’s first round of play 
after missing the Tar Heel Invite two weeks ago 
to attend Qualifying School for the LPGA Tour. 
Lendl and Piccio will open play 
on Monday in a tie for 19th. 
JUCO transfer Elcin Ulu and 
freshman Ursa Orehek both carded a 76 (+4) to round out Florida’s lineup. 
The Gators finished tied for sec-
ond at the Betsy Rawls Invitational last season, marking the team’s sec-ond top-two finish of the year. UF looks to recapture that success over the course of the next two days.

Redshirt senior Tangerine 
Wiggs has made the most of 
her three rotations this sea-son by racking up 165 kills, but Friday night she outper -
formed herself when she set a new school record in Florida’s 3-0 (25-11, 25-8, 25-11) win against Mississippi State. 
In 2012, Wiggs has made 
the most of her swings. The right-side hitter currently ranks second in the Southeast-ern Conference with a .409 hitting percentage. 
Wiggs has made one or 
fewer errors in more than half of her 21 matches, including six errorless showings. She also is tied for the fewest er -
rors among Florida hitters who have played in at least 36 sets.
Still, the most effective 
performance of her career came in Friday’s home match against the Bulldogs, in which she had 13 kills for a .929 hit-ting clip.
“My hitting percentage is 
solely a reflection of my pass-ers and my setter,” Wiggs said. “I’m blessed to have a really great setter in Taylor Braun-eis. She does a really great job of distributing the ball and getting me great looks, and our passers do a great job of putting up passes that create hittable sets for me.”
Wiggs’ hitting percentage 
set a new Florida record. The previous best was .923 by Be-navia Jenkins in 2002. Wiggs also tacked on an assist, a dig and two blocks in the quick match, while leading all play-ers with 14 points.
“Tangerine against either 
of [Mississippi State’s] left sides was a great matchup for us earlier because of their size,” coach Mary Wise said. “We had a lot of advantage the first time, and that was part of the game plan no mat-ter what lineup it was; we just felt like Tange could get some good swings over there.”
Florida’s win marked its 
12th sweep of the season, but it had to do so without redshirt senior Betsy Smith, who turned her ankle in UF’s loss against Florida State on Wednesday in Tallahassee. The middle blocker has been a key part of the Gators’ suc-cess this season with 120 kills, 42 digs and 48 blocks.
In Smith’s absence, red-
shirt freshman Simone Antwi saw an increase in playing time. Antwi registered a block and four kills, including the game-winning point off a set by Brauneis.
“This has happened before 
in our program where there’s just not enough playing time,” Wise said. “You hate to have it happen by somebody get-ting an injury, but we knew Simone would be ready.”
The Gators (18-3, 12-0 SEC) 
had 36 kills against only six errors in addition to record-ing 10 blocks and five aces. They also performed well on defense, keeping Mississippi State (4-17, 0-12 SEC) to a mi-nus-.141 hitting percentage and only three blocks.
“We did a nice job (on de-
fense) tonight, but it’s also un-derstanding that Mississippi State ran a, best way to put it, nothing-too-fancy offense because they lost their setter earlier,” Wise said. “It’s not like playing Florida State that in every rotation (there are) three hitters running multi-ple quicks. If we can get [our defense] better, then I think we’ve got a chance to be play-ing some of the best volleyball at the end of the year.”

Florida 9, Georgia 17
Georgia was deep 
in Florida territory in the second quarter with a 7-0 lead when 
Evans intercepted Aaron Murray after the pass bounced off Rantavious Wooten’s hands. Evans finished with six tackles and a pass breakup. He 
leads the team with 50 tackles in 2012. 
Trailing 7-6 at the end of the first half, the Gators had the ball on the Bulldogs’ 5-yard 
line and were poised to at least kick a field goal and take a lead into halftime. How -
ever, on second down, Driskel rolled to his right, threw the ball across his body and was picked off in the end zone by Georgia safety Bacarri Rambo.6
UF committed six turnovers on Saturday. Prior 
to the game, it had turned the ball over four 
times in 2012, the lowest total in the SEC. Jeff 
Driskel accounted for four turnovers, throwing 
two interceptions and losing two fumbles. 
Driskel had two turnovers before Saturday.KEY STAT

The Bulldogs set the tone on the third 
play of the opening drive as defensive back Damian Swann sacked Driskel and forced a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Jarvis Jones. The Bull-dogs would score a touchdown three 
plays later.
After Mitchell’s touchdown, Florida drove 
from its own 26-yard line to the Georgia 18 on eight plays. Then, on a second down, Driskel found tight end Jordan Reed over the middle. Reed turned up field and gained 13 yards before Jones 
punched the ball out at the 5-yard line. Georgia recovered in the end zone and ran out the clock. Down 10-9, the Gators had a chance to force a punt on a third-and-5 from their 45-yard line in the fourth quarter. But Aaron Murray found Malcolm Mitchell on a curl route to the left. Cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy missed the initial 
tackle and Mitchell took it to the end zone to extend Georgia’s lead.
Tight end’s fumble one of many key mistakes in Florida loss
committed four of the Gators’ six turn-
overs.
“I made some critical mistakes,” Driskel 
said. “That’s what it comes down to. When you have a defense like we do, you can’t turn the ball over. They’re going to make stops. You can’t force things. You’ve just got to take points, and there were a couple of times there where we took points off the board and put our defense in tough spots.”
Despite numerous mistakes and a slow 
start, Florida still had chances to escape with a victory. The Gators’ failure to seize opportunistic moments proved heart-breaking.Trailing by eight points and facing 
second-and-6 from Georgia’s 18-yard line with just more than two minutes remain-ing, Driskel hit tight end Jordan Reed over the middle for a 13-yard gain.
As the play neared completion, Reed 
jumped from the 5 and attempted to break the plane of the goal line.
While airborne, Reed took a hit from 
UGA linebacker Jarvis Jones and fumbled, losing a grip on both the ball and Florida’s control of the SEC East race. The Gators could not recover.
“It wasn’t one play that lost the game 
for us,” Jon Halapio said. “It was a team effort. There was no play here or there that could have definitely taken us out of the situation that we were in during the fourth quarter.”
The football was not the only thing 
Florida lost a grip on during Saturday’s game. Tempers flared early and often be-tween the Gators and the Bulldogs.
A pregame scuffle between the teams 
became so heated, even Florida strength coach Jeff Dillman got involved, yelling at Georgia players and coaches.
Overall, UF racked up 10 penalties for 
95 yards. Referees called four unsports-manlike conduct penalties and five per -
sonal fouls against the two teams. 
Under a coach renown for losing his 
cool on the sidelines, Florida lost control of its emotions.
“There was a lot of penalties,” Jon Bostic 
said. “Some of them we couldn’t control. Some of them we definitely could control. We got to play better in those areas.”
In Jacksonville, the Gators had a chance 
to preserve their perfect season. 
They had an opportunity to finally put 
the hardship of the past two seasons be-hind them.
With both the game and the SEC East 
title on the line, UF could not deliver.
Gone is the dream of Florida’s first un-
defeated season in school history. Gone is a straightforward path to the BCS Cham-pionship Game in Miami.
All that was left was sadness.“Everybody had tears,” Jon Halapio 
said. “Everybody was disappointed.”
