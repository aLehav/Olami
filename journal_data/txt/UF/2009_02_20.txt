ON DEKKBy BOBBY CALLOVI

With another outstanding season, Matt 
den Dekker could be on his way to a profes-
sional baseball future.
A career in the majors seems like his des-
tiny now, but just three years ago, the center fielder’s future in college baseball appeared bleak.
No big programs ever looked at him, but 
with the help of his talented cousin and a re-cruiter who saw something in him that not many else did, den Dekker had a shot with a top-level team.
It wasn’t until Ross Jones, UF’s former 
recruiting coordinator, came to watch den Dekker’s cousin, Kevin Chapman, at a prac-tice during their senior year of high school 
that den Dekker’s fate changed courses.
“He was such a good outfielder, and he 
didn’t have anyone (recruiting) him, which 
was amazing to me,” Jones said. “I really felt he could be an asset to us.”
Two years after finally getting that schol-
arship offer, den Dekker has made teams look foolish for not going after him in high school.
Under the Radar
As UF’s football team routed FSU in 2005 
in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, den Dekker sat in the crowd unsure where he would attend 
college.
He was coming off a junior campaign 
where he hit .350 with four home runs and 
pitched for Fort Lauderdale’s Westminster 
Academy.The attention he felt he deserved never 
came, even with scouts dropping by to watch Westminster Academy’s ace — Chap-
man.
And the small schools that did talk to him 
wanted him as a pitcher. The soft-spoken den Dekker disagreed with those scouts.
“I wanted to play outfield because I saw 
myself with more of a future as an out-fielder,” den Dekker said. “I wanted to play somewhere, whether it’s a junior college or D-I, that I could play outfield.”
As the end of high school neared, he was 
resigned to the fact that he might have to settle on a smaller school, most likely Santa Fe College or Broward College. To keep his spirits up, his mom, Lou Ann, reminded 
him that attending a smaller college would 
allow him to play sooner.
The most attention he got his junior year  
of high school was when Jones came to a 
game to watch Chapman and noticed den Dekker out in center, but it was only enough to put him on the back burner.
“I really liked Matt a lot as a center field-
er, but we already had an outfielder com-mitted,” said Jones, now head coach at St. Johns River Community College. “I just kept Matt in the back of (my) mind.”
Chapman tried to sell Jones on his cousin 
with a simple but effective message.
“I told them he is (the) best center fielder 
I’ve ever seen play, and he’s a hard work-er,” Chapman said.
The second time Jones saw den Dekker 
play — at that practice in the fall of 2005 — he was convinced den Dekker could play at the next level. Jones invited him to visit UF 
with Chapman for the FSU-UF game.Instead of offering den Dekker a scholar-
ship on the visit, Jones told him to attend the Gators’ winter baseball camp. There, 
den Dekker shined and confirmed Jones’ feelings.
Jones still wasn’t sure how to get him 
into a crowded recruiting class, so he began to call occasionally to let den Dekker know UF was interested — a process known as “soft recruiting.”
During the 2006 season, the Gators 
coaches realized they had needs they had not filled with the incoming class.
“As things progressed and we realized 
we needed more power in the lineup and 
more speed, I felt very strongly that (den 
Dekker) was a guy that could help us,” Jones said.
With that, den Dekker was offered a spot 
in a Division I program thanks to a coach 
willing to take a risk on him.
 “I thought for sure he was a guy some-
body would have swept up, but nobody 
took a chance,” Jones said. “I felt he was be-
ing overlooked, and we took the chance.”
Summer of Baseball
Jerry den Dekker made sure to instill a 
good work ethic in his son when he first 
started coaching him at age 4.
He drilled into his son the tendencies to 
run out pop-ups and never give up on a ball hit in his direction, and even balls not hit directly to him.
When den Dekker was 11, he went after 
a ball, collided with his teammate in left field and got hit in the eye with the ball. Although he came out of the game, he was back to work the next day.
That work ethic won the 6-foot-1, 
205-pound den Dekker the starting job in center field his freshman year at UF.
He flashed his glove more than his bat 
that year as he held on to the starting job for most of the season despite hitting only .234 — the lowest average of the regular players.
After the season, he headed north to 
New Hampshire to spend the summer play-ing for the Keene Swamp Bats in the New England Collegiate Baseball League.
With nothing else but baseball going on 
in Keene, den Dekker was able to focus on his game and improve his hitting.
“My freshman year I struggled trying to 
do too much, but I could play with speed and had some power, and I worked on try-
ing to stay within that and not try to outdo 
myself,” den Dekker said.
In Keene, he found his comfort level and 
played well enough to be named to the All-
Star Game roster.
With his confidence regained, he returned 
to Gainesville for his sophomore year ready 
to show the new coaching staff — led by Kevin O’Sullivan — he had improved.
“I gained a lot of confidence over that 
summer, seeing the ball real well and find-ing an approach that worked,” den Dekker said.
National Praise
The batting cages at the baseball field are 
rarely quiet, mainly because of den Dekker, who can be found working on his swing 
most hours of the day.
“He’s hitting here 24/7,” O’Sullivan said. 
“You leave here at night and you hear him 
banging away in the cages, you come here 
two hours before practice, you can hear the 
cages banging away.”
With the lessons he learned in New 
Hampshire, his hard work in the cages and his natural ability, den Dekker put together a sophomore season that granted him ac-colades for more than just his fielding and helped the Gators surprise many critics. 
The team finished third in the Southeastern 
Conference.
His batting average ballooned to .333, 
and he also belted eight homers and was 
a perfect 20 for 20 in stolen-base attempts. 
Those numbers and his continued stellar defensive play earned him an All-SEC first-team spot.
“He has always been tremendous (in 
center) and has had a lot of potential at the plate, and he’s really come into his own and his role on the team,” UF left fielder Avery Barnes said.
His tremendous year and his solid play 
at the trials landed him a spot on the USA National Collegiate team this past summer, when he started in the USA’s gold-medal victory over Japan in the World University 
Baseball Championship in the Czech Re-
public.
Den Dekker’s success last season also 
gave him a new swagger against opponents 
who never gave him a chance out of high 
school.
“When we play in-state teams that didn’t 
recruit me, it’s fun to show them that they missed their chance to recruit me,” he said. 
Whiteboard Dreams
“We swear we will be Major League 
players.”
Before entering high school, den Dekker 
and a friend wrote that promise on a white-board on his refrigerator and signed it.
That message got pushed to the back of 
his mind in high school because of his de-
sire just to get a spot on a Division I roster.
Now, that declaration has begun to creep 
toward the front again.
Even with how close he is, he is still con-
centrated on this year and the Gators’ suc-cess, but another good statistical year could 
land him as a top draft selection.He enters this season on multiple All-
American teams — the second teams of Baseball America and the National Colle-giate Baseball Writers Association — and on 
watch lists for national awards given to the 
best player in college baseball — the Brooks Wallace Award and Golden Spikes Award. 
The preseason attention is sure to entice 
many MLB scouts to come watch him play, 
and when they begin to compare him to cur-
rent major leaguers, den Dekker hopes that one name pops up as they watch him cover most of the outfield.
“Grady Sizemore (of the Cleveland Indi-
ans) is a guy I try and model my game af-ter,” den Dekker said. “He’s got speed, can hit the ball, plays great center field and will go after anything and doesn’t care if he has 
to run into a wall to catch a ball.”
Den Dekker has demonstrated many of 
those skills in his time at UF and before 
college, so much that his dad is barely sur-
prised anymore when he makes an out-
standing catch.
But the two plays that stuck out most to 
Jerry were the time he sprinted and dove head first to catch a ball in the SEC Tourna-
ment versus Vanderbilt in 2008 and when 
he made a catch at the wall against FSU.
“Matt has always gone at everything 
full speed, so seeing the plays he makes in 
college is nothing new,” Jerry said. “We’ve 
seen him make them growing up.”
The Gators’ center fielder knows his hard 
work and aggressive style have gotten him this far and isn’t about to stop that.
But that doesn’t mean he can’t dream 
about what it will be like in the majors. After all, this has been his dream since he started throwing a ball off a wall in his house when 
he was 2.
“I go to a bunch of Marlins games when 
I’m home, and every time I go out there I 
picture myself out there,” den Dekker said. “With all the time and effort I put in, I know 
how close I am to reaching my dream to 
make it to the major leagues.”

An intruder gained access to files con-
taining the personal information, includ-
ing Social Security numbers, of more than 97,200 UF students, faculty and staff who used the Grove computer system from 
1996 to 2009, UF announced Thursday.
UF is mailing letters to those who may 
have been affected, most of whom live in 
Florida, according to a UF news release. 
UF has no contact information for about 
5,000 people, the release stated. 
A toll-free hotline has also been estab-
lished at 1-877-657-9133.
The privacy breach is costing UF about 
$130,000, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said. Costs include sending letters and hir-ing a call center.
Sikes said UF has no information to suggest the information was used fraudu-lently.
A University Police Department report 
said the system may have been accessed by people in Antigua and Barbuda Brazil, lo-cated in the Caribbean.
The data breach is the fourth one an-
nounced by UF in the past year.
The breach was discovered 
on Jan. 14 by a staff member in the Academic Technology department while UF was switching from the Grove 
system to a new system.
The system was immediately shut down 
and then retired as a result of the breach. It was used by faculty to post course-related materials for students and hosted free Web space. It was also UF’s first e-mail system, Sikes said.

Iraqi says he threw shoes at Bush to restore pride
BAGHDAD (AP) — The Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes 
at George W. Bush did not apologize as his trial began Thursday, 
and instead struck a defiant tone — telling the judges he wanted to hit back at the humiliation Iraq had suffered at U.S. hands.
It was Muntadhar al-Zeidi’s first public appearance since he 
was arrested in mid-December for hurling shoes at Bush during a news conference. The act turned the reporter into a cult hero.
“What made me do it was the humiliation Iraq has been sub-
jected to due to the U.S. occupation and the murder of innocent people,” al-Zeidi told the court. “I wanted to restore the pride of the Iraqis in any way possible, apart from using weapons.”Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF President Bernie Machen talks about the potential impact on the UF budget of the federal economic stimulus 
package at the Faculty Senate meeting in the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom on Thursday afternoon.
� UNIVERSITY WILL REQUEST $420M TO FUND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS.

UF could rake in hundreds of millions of dollars from the 
$787 billion stimulus package signed by President Barack 
Obama on Tuesday but, then again, the number could be much lower.
UF will request $420 million in stimulus money, mainly 
for energy-efficiency modifications. The rest, about $43 mil-lion, will be used for fire and safety code compliance and other 
building upgrades.
“It’s been like a scavenger hunt, we’ve been looking under 
rocks and trying to figure out where we are,” UF President 
Bernie Machen told the Faculty Senate on Thursday before an-nouncing that UF will adjust its budget-cutting schedule be-cause of the uncertainty swirling around the new legislation.
It’s just not clear, he told faculty, if the stimulus package 
will offset state budget cuts enough to soften the possible $72 to $75 million blow to UF’s budget next year.
As a result, Machen said colleges and administrative units UF adjusts to

Fall tuition at UF could increase by as 
much as 15 percent if a bill unanimously 
approved by a Florida State Legislature committee passes. 
The bill, approved Wednesday by the 
Senate Higher Education Committee, would allow state universities to charge a supplemental tuition fee, which would not be covered by the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship, in addition to the regular tuition cost. 
The bill would allow the Board of 
Trustees, UF’s highest governing body, to increase tuition by as much as 15 per-
cent each year until UF’s tuition matched 
that of the national average, which will be determined by a mandatory confer-ence.UF spokesman Steve Orlando said 
UF, which has one of the lowest state university tuitions, is absolutely in sup-port of the bill. 
“If students want a degree that actu-
ally means something when they gradu-ate then we have no choice but to raise tuition,“ he said.

Fla. leads nation in rise in 
food stamp requests 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — 
As the economy tanks, the number 
of families relying on food stamps for their next meal is rising nation-ally.
Florida has seen the biggest 
jump, with a 29 percent increase.Correa, a UF student and film di-rector for RUB. 
The film received its NC-17 
rating for explicit sexual content, he said. Students must bring a driver’s license in order to show 
they are at least 18 years old, Cor-
rea said. 
Although there is also an R-
rated version of the film, Correa chose to show the more explicit cut because it communicates the direc-tor’s original intent.  
Correa said he hasn’t received 
any complaints or heard of any one 
protesting the film being shown.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said he could understand why 
some might object but said most students at UF are already adults and capable of making their own decisions. 
UF President Bernie Machen 
agreed. 
“What’s wrong with our stu-
dents? They’re just going down the tubes, aren’t they,” Machen joked in a Thursday interview.  
“Our kids are smart enough to de-cide for themselves which movies to go see,” Machen said seriously. 
The movie will be shown in the 
Reitz Union on Sunday, Monday, 
Wednesday and Thursday at both 
8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.

Car hits woman on campus
A woman was arrested 
Wednesday night after she hit an-other woman with her car in a UF parking garage.
At around 7:25 p.m. in the park-
ing garage in front of the O’Connell Center, Maria Sresovich, 43, hit a woman who was trying to save a parking spot for her friend.
University Police Officer Tim 
Peck said the woman saving the spot was affiliated with UF.
The woman said that when 
Sresovich turned into the spot, 
she tried to get out of the way but 
couldn’t, and Sresovich hit her with her car several times, bump-ing her out of the space.
Peck said the woman was not 
injured in any way.
Stresovich told officials she saw 
the woman standing there when she was pulling into the space, but 
she didn’t think she hit the woman 
with the car.
It is against the rules at UF to 
hold a parking space for a car by standing in it, Peck said.
“The violation of this rule does 
not justify someone hitting her,” he said.
 —KATIE EMMETSMore than 408,835 new recip-
ients were added to Florida’s list 
in the past year, prompting state leaders to look for help in fund-ing the increase.
Legislators shifted some 
money to the program during a special session to help pay for in-creased staffing needs. Without it, officials say food stamp recipi-ents would have had extraordi-nary wait times.
The Department of Children 
& Families says it needs 288 more 
employees to meet the demand 
at a cost of about $6.5 million.

Trustees keep retreat local
UF’s Board of Trustees is tak-
ing a staycation this year due to 
budget cuts.
For its annual retreat today, 
the board will convene at the 
Lake Wauburg Cypress Lodge 
instead of traveling to White Oak, north of Jacksonville, or Fort Myers, in South Florida, as it has in previous years.
UF has also pared the retreat 
down to one day instead of the typical two.
As a result, UF will be spend-
ing about a quarter to a fifth of what it normally spends on the retreat, said Janine Sikes, UF spokeswoman.
“It’s not prudent to be spend-
ing money amid a budget crisis,” Sikes said.
This year, she said, UF is 
shelling out $1,800 for a catering 
service and supplies — anything 
from pencils to tablecloths.
Those are private funds pro-
vided by the UF Foundation, wrote Brian Beach, UF’s interim senior vice president for admin-istration, in an e-mail.
Trustees who live outside of 
Gainesville pay for their own 
travel expenses.
The retreat gives the board a 
chance to  discuss “big-picture” 
items in an informal setting, like what UF’s priorities should be during budget cuts,  Sikes said. The board will not vote on any issues.
“These are twenty-thousand-
feet discussions,” she said.
Among those who will make 
presentations today are UF Presi-dent Bernie Machen and Shands HealthCare CEO Tim Goldfarb.

Gainesville civil servants have 
their own motivations for public 
work, but money is not one of them. 
For the most part, it’s a love for 
the job that keeps civil servants com-
ing back for more, they said. 
Gainesville City Commissioner 
Jeanna Mastrodicasa said she does 
not do her job for money, but to con-tribute to the community. As a city commissioner, Mastrodicasa makes an annual salary of $30,929.12.
“I really enjoy helping make 
good decisions for Gainesville,” she said. “And I learn a lot; I think that’s the best part.”
Of the six city commissioners, 
Mastrodicasa said Commissioner Craig Lowe is the only full-time commissioner.
The five others, including herself, 
hold other jobs. 
Aside from the near-30 hours 
per week Mastrodicasa works as a city commissioner, she is also an as-sistant vice president of student af-fairs at UF where her annual salary is $81,600.
Mastrodicasa said Gainesville 
Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan, who makes an annual salary of $39,364.36 for her duties as mayor, is also a con-sultant to the Trust for Public Land in their Conservation Finance Pro-
gram.
According to 
the University Police, the base pay of a begin-ning UPD officer is $17.04 an hour.
With 2,088 
hours in a year, the salary of a 
starting officer is $35,579.52, UPD spokesman Capt. Jeff Holcomb said.
With 283 sworn officers, the base 
pay for a starting Gainesville Police Department officer varies, said Lt. Allan Willis.If the officer has only a high 
school education and no experi-ence, the annual salary would start at $41,116.61. 
Willis said if the officer has a col-
lege degree and law enforcement ex-perience, the starting salary would begin at $46,519.62.
Senior Library Manager Be As-
tengo said the pay of those who work in the Alachua County library system is modest, starting with a base pay of $26,557.65. 
Astengo was first a library assis-
tant at the Alachua County library when she was hired 18 years ago. Now, the starting salary for her po-sition is $47,693.57, according to the Alachua County Web site.
Astengo said she got her mas-
ter’s degree in education from UF, but after working for a library in the children’s department, she changed her career.
It was all the fun she hoped for 
with teaching without the stress, she said.
Astengo then successfully pur-
sued her master’s degree in library science from USF.
“People who go into things like 
teaching, social work and libraries do it for the helping aspect,” she said. “I loved my job immediately. It’s stimulating, challenging and not as easy as it looks.”
� A WOMEN’S STUDIES PROFESSOR 
CLAIMED DISCRIMINATION.
By KRISTEN HUFF

UF’s authority to change the agreement un-
der which faculty are hired without their con-
sent was questioned Thursday in a six-hour arbitration hearing. 
UF and the faculty member in question 
each presented evidence concerning the uni-versity’s right to adjust her course load with-out her permission.   
When Florence Babb, an endowed profes-
sor and graduate coordinator of UF’s Center for Women’s Studies and Gender Research, 
received her agreement letter in March 2004 outlining the terms of her hire, it determined 
she would teach one course per semester and promised her a research assistant. 
Endowed faculty are expected to increase 
the university’s prestige with their contribu-tions and research, and thus they often have 
lighter teaching loads. 
Last March, Babb was informed via a let-
ter from then-interim dean of the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences, Joe Glover, that her teaching load would be increased from one course per semester to two courses per semester “because of the state’s fiscal difficul-ties and the severe budget cuts applied to UF.” Babb said to her knowledge she was the only 
endowed professor to receive such a letter at 
that time. She was also relieved of her research assistant. Babb said the lower course load al-lowed time to conduct research. 
She filed a grievance in April 2008 and said that  UF violated an agreement it has with the United Faculty of Florida, or UFF, the faculty union. According to Babb’s grievance, because she is the only female and lowest-paid CLAS endowed professor, UF’s actions were “gener-
ally discriminatory.” 
An arbitration 
hearing is the last of three steps when a 
grievance is filed.  After step one, Babb was reassigned a graduate assistant, but her course load has not been reduced. 
Charlie Deal, UF associate general coun-
sel, represented the university in yesterday’s hearing. Deal said that within the Center for 
Women’s Studies and Gender Research, Babb 
is the highest paid endowed professor, she has received a salary increase and her teaching load has been lower than that of other profes-sors in the center. “There is no evidence of discrimination 
possible,” he said. 
Deal also argued that because Babb’s salary 
increased since the time she was hired, she had to have known that the terms of her agreement were subject to change.
Jane Brockmann, chair of the UFF Griev-
ance Committee, was called as a witness for Babb. Brockmann said UF only has the right to adjust the details of teaching, not the course load. 
Angel Kwolek-Folland, who was the di-
rector of the center when Babb was hired and signed her agreement letter, did not agree with Brockmann and spoke on behalf of UF.
“It was an offer that would always be con-
tingent on circumstances that might change,” Kwolek-Folland said. 
Decisions usually come within 60 days of 
the hearing.Despite low salaries, city workers still motivated

Gainesville City Commissioners ap-
proved an act that will allow for the instal-
lation of red light cameras at congested intersections at their meeting Thursday.
Under the new Gainesville Traffic 
Safety Enhancement Act, red light run-ners will be fined $125 for the first and sec-ond violations and $175 for any violations thereafter.  
The system will pay for itself, accord-
ing to the agenda.
The Gainesville Police Department is 
responsible for choosing a service pro-vider.
The Commission also decided against 
selling Ironwood Golf Course Thursday, but not before voicing their strong, and at 
times emotionally-charged, opinions.
“This has been a very, very difficult 
conversation,” Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan 
said.
Ironwood, at 2100 NE 39th Ave., is 
Gainesville’s city-owned golf course.
The course is 
facing a $3 million deficit, according to 
a report presented 
at the meeting.
Commissioners decided to move for-
ward with $1.1 million in improvement 
plans for the golf course and possibly leas-ing it out.
The improvements include rebuilding 
the green and improving fairway drain-age.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2009
City OKs red light camerasSTUDENT GOVERNMENT

Alligator Writer
About 75 people attended the last de-
bate before Student Government elections 
on Feb. 24 and 25 at the UF Hillel.
Candidates from all four parties spoke 
about the need for a new direction for SG 
during the Hispanic Student Association 
debate, co-hosted with Union De Estudi-antes Puertorriquenos Activos, UF’s Puer-to Rican club.
Once again, candidates addressed hot 
topics like online voting, free printing and sustainability. 
“This election comes down to change,” 
said Mark McShera, presidential candi-
date of the Orange and Blue Party, during 
his opening statement. “We’re at a cross-roads. We can choose to tolerate the same broken system or go down a new path.”Progress Party presidential candidate 
Ben Dictor later agreed, adding his opin-ion on the only way to fix it.
“Exposing corruption is not enough,” 
he said. “You have to make an effort to end it.”
Frank Walch, presidential candidate of 
the Keg Party, got a few laughs when he spoke on his eco-friendly initiatives. 
“We need to take the hot air out of 
all our Student Government members’ heads,” he said. “It will cut down on glob-al warming.”
However, candidates also raised cur-
rent issues, like the recent removal of Vietnamese and Korean programs from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. 
“We need to promote these programs,” 
said the Unite Party’s candidate for vice 
president Larnell Vickers. “They make 
our university a more diverse campus.”SG gets last say in debate

Today’s question: Do friends let friends spray tan?Thursday’s question: Will you be voting in SG elections?College means more than just diploma
I’ve come to terms with my post-graduation jobless -
ness. I haven’t raised a white flag. Hope is not lost. 
I just understand my career won’t be awaiting me, 
flowers in hand.
The craziest part is I am not concerned — at all.I know journalism isn’t exactly booming at the mo-
ment, so my job chances are leaving slim and approach-ing none. Don’t worry about me, I’ll figure it out. Why should I waste my time having a heart attack about what isn’t in the cards right now?
I know I’m less qualified than others. The difference 
between me and these well-to-do overachievers is their 
motivation kicked in long before mine did.
I’m motivated now, but freshman year I only con-
cerned myself with the future when it was Monday, and 
I drooled at the thought of going to Balls on Thursday. 
Nothing spells success like hoarding a dozen $1 double 
bourbons in a two-hour span. Long live my liver.
I’ve taken my time in college. I’ve stumbled, failed 
and stopped showing up to classes on non-test days.
Am I proud? The better question is whether I’m 
ashamed. I tinkered with the notion for a bit at the end of 
my junior year, only to figure out I was still wasting time. I refuse to dwell on stupid things I’ve already done.
Regrets are mental indigestion. It’s your brain saying, 
“Oh God, I should not have eaten that.” Take some ce-rebral Alka-Seltzer, take a deep breath and get yourself back on track toward the goal we all share — gradua-tion.
There’s more to a college degree than ink and paper. 
Don’t reduce it to an impersonal rubber stamp that con-firmed you trudged through a monotonous course load.
When I get it, my degree will be the hard evidence that 
I grew up while I was here. It will represent the choices I’ve made, good and bad.
My piece of paper will show the 
versatility necessary to simultane-ously work 20-plus hours a week, write a column, play intramurals, travel with and play for a sport club, be an active president of a stu-dent organization and take 15 cred-it hours, while still finding time to 
nap, play a little beer pong and not alienate my girlfriend without having a panic attack.
My freshman self is long dead. Good riddance, screw 
that guy.
My degree will never symbolize failure, as a student 
or a person. It won’t hint at struggle or remind me of dropped classes. It will highlight perseverance.
A degree is validation. This place is teaching you to 
balance, and your piece of paper will show that you had the resilience to plow through four years of a schedule packed tighter than midtown on ladies’ night.
The American job market has been crippled, and the 
economic bounce-back we’re all crossing our fingers for isn’t just around the bend. Even if you get a cushy job, the chance of a layoff in your near future is possible. It hurts to think about.
College isn’t four-year workforce boot camp. It’s a 
ride. Once we’re out of college, we aren’t back to square one; we’re there for the first time. 
I made the mistake of relaxing too much. Every day, 
I see people who don’t relax at all. The middle ground is what we should be searching for, not a cornflower blue tie or a three-car garage.
Adam Wynn is a journalism senior. His column appears 
on Fridays.With midterms currently cramping our cool-as-a-cu-
cumber style, the understatement of the year would be to say that tension runs high at the Department 
of Darts & Laurels. Sure, we know that Spring Break is almost here, but how do you expect us to study up on the unabridged 
history of satellites when we can’t stop daydreaming about 
getting our tan on at the beach?
Lest we forget to mention the fact that the newsroom lacks 
any semblance of natural light – causing one unnamed male editor to resort to, gasp, spray tanning.
As we put down our flash cards and notes (from Einstein’s, 
of course), we offer you this week’s five-hour-energy-shots-are-our-new-best-friend edition of 
Darts & Laurels
Hilarity out of Washington state tells us that one would-
be crime victim had a trick up his sleeve while his house was 
being robbed. Instead of letting a team of burglars make off 
with his three flat-screen televisions, the man had the pres-ence of mind to drive their getaway car out of sight to a 
friend’s house. The Department of Darts & Laurels proudly presents a wish-we-could-have-seen-the-look-on-their faces 
LAUREL to Patrick Rosario for beating the bad guys at their 
own game. Not too shabby for a guy who just lost his job.
Drama students from a California high school are calling 
for the head of their homophobic principal after she canceled 
their production of the play, “Rent.” Due to the fact that the 
show portrays gay and lesbian characters, the principal was afraid of how such behavior would negatively influence stu-
dents. For her clear act of intolerance and lack of sensitivity, 
the Department of Darts & Laurels launches a you-have-no-business-bringing-such-hate-inside-of-a-school DART at 
principal Fal Asrani. To that we say, “Bisexuals, trisexuals, homo sapiens, carcinogens, hallucinocens, men, Pee Wee Herman! German wine, turpentine, Gertrude Stein, Anto-
niotti, Bertolucci, Kurosawa, Carmina Burana!”
Clogged arteries and shortness of breath aside, the fast 
food industry has enjoyed resounding success even in the 
wake of the economic downturn. For one finger-lickin’-good 
chicken franchise, sales have been so stellar that they are even 
planning to create 9,000 new jobs in Europe. The Department 
of Darts & Laurels presents a let-the-colonel-do-the-cooking 
LAUREL to KFC for doing their part to help buck the world-
wide trend of unemployment. Hmm, we can’t help but won-der if those KFC green beans (oh-so-much-butter) are consid-
ered part of a well-balanced diet?
When you know your boss has a reputation for not wear-
ing neckties or sports coats, you better be prepared to wear 
see-through tops as part of your uniform. Word out of Lon-don informs us that female workers for the National Express 
train were issued blouses described as “leaving little to the 
imagination.” For his blatantly sexist act of turning a train 
ride into a burlesque house on wheels, the Department of 
Darts & Laurels launches a you-should-have-coughed-up-the-dough-for-better-quality-clothes DART at National Ex-
press Chief Executive Richard Bowker. We suggest a punish-ment of forcing this bully of a boss to don formal attire to 
work would be a nice touch.
Well past his prime and requiring a pair of pants push-
ing a 40-inch waist, the return of Ken Griffey Jr. to the Se-
attle Mariners brings hope to a city in dire need of optimism. 
Sure, the team has little chance of making the playoffs, but 
the sheer fact that “Junior Griff” will once again be donning 
the navy blue and green has fans re-energized after years of 
lackluster seasons. The Department of Darts & Laurels tosses 
a you-truly-are-a-class-act LAUREL to Ken Griffey Jr. for 
returning home to the team where he started his legendary 
career. In a time in which the sport of baseball is mired by 
steroid controversy, Junior’s drug-free legacy continues to 
shine brighter.  
That’s all for this week. Go Gators!Adam Wynn

Votes should express ideals
Since Thursday’s column about 
the validity of voting for revenge, 
I’ve gotten the chance to speak to Erik Voss. I was able to impress upon him my regret at having never 
heard about the comments posted 
on his Facebook. After a long day of trying to figure out what exactly happened, a friend of mine came forward and acknowledged that it was he who, after one-too-many drinks, left the aforementioned note on Voss’s Facebook one evening while I was still logged in. He has 
since apologized to Voss and me. 
Ah, the perils of politics in the 
Internet age! 
Let me take this chance to say 
further that this election is one of 
the most important ones to face the student body in a long time. Our current financial crisis threatens the student body’s education and wal-lets, putting more importance on making sure the money we give to SG is spent properly. 
Who we elect to govern impacts 
our community as a whole. There-fore, the act of voting transcends 
self-interest and becomes a civic 
duty as our actions affect the stu-dent body at large. 
Elections are what we rely on in 
a democratic system. Every citizen is entrusted with the well being of the society we live in.
In order to fulfill our duty to that 
society, we vote.
At UF, our ballots determine to 
whom the $14 million collected from the students is given to; they deter-mine who represents the student body on the board of trustees, and most importantly, your ballots de-termine the people that are charged with having your best interests in mind, whether it’s in the Senate or in the Executive Branch.
So when you vote, you are ex-
pressing your will to have your 
choice of candidate represent the 
entire student body. Do you really want that decision to be made based on selfish whims?
Revenge shouldn’t be a moti-
vation for voting, especially when misinformation is the only evi-dence for it. Your vote should be an expression of how you would 
see your government run. To make 
that decision based on reasons that don’t pertain to the functioning of Student Government is tantamount to telling the student body you care about your personal grudges more than true issues that separate the candidates.

Dictor didn’t write comments
The following is in response to 
my column that appeared in Thurs-day’s Alligator, which referenced some harsh comments written about me two years ago apparently 
by Ben Dictor, the Progress Party’s 
candidate for SG president.
I received an e-mail on Thursday 
from a UF alumnus and friend of Dictor’s named Brian Gates. Gates claimed responsibility for the com-ments I referenced: he said he had made them while he was acciden-tally logged into Dictor’s Facebook account.
Dictor says he had no knowl-
edge of the comments. Over the past two years, I received no reason to believe Dictor didn’t make those comments. My column was based off this assumption. 
While I regret the confusion this 
“identity theft” has caused, I stand by my statements regarding cam-pus politics and student voting hab-
its: Let’s not take this too seriously 
folks. 
In the meantime, should Gates 
ever decide to run for public office, my pen will be ready.

Ah, the naiveté of being a UF freshman. 
I remember my first election vivid-
ly, strolling across Turlington Plaza as 
I was bombarded by fliers from the Progress 
and Gator parties, proclaiming the omnipo-
tence of the dueling platforms.  
That year I ran as an independent. I even 
won the glowing endorsement of this very 
paper, proclaiming that “both parties were less than impressive…and we should take the Kyle Robisch approach to supporting the best ideas, regardless of who supports them.” Even with the endorsement, I fell well short of vic-tory in the fall of 2007. 
For the next two semesters, I found myself 
in the Orange and Blue camp hoping that they could change the political scene. Yet a year later, despite promises of online voting, SG transparency and effective governance, the student body was left with little change and few results. 
So a friend and I decided to form an in-
dependent, non-partisan organization called “Swamp the Polls” to increase voter turnout, because I felt that there was no way to directly 
change SG except from the outside. 
For far too long, our student government 
has been fundamentally broken. On one side 
there were complaints of corruption and in-efficiency, while the other sat and argued but didn’t do much more. Yet this election cycle brought promise, as a new party, Unite, emerged. 
As someone who has been on all sides of 
UF politics, from independent to Orange and Blue, to apathetic, I was initially skeptical.  I had to choose between offers to slate with both Orange and Blue and Unite. Wasn’t this just going to be a continuation of the politics of old, under a fresh new banner?It quickly became 
apparent that this wasn’t the case. Mov-ing beyond the petty bickering of the Orange 
and Blue/Progress 
split, Unite promises to move SG in a positive, new direction.
Rather than stick-
ing to petty platform points such as posting a crossing guard at Hume or live streaming Stu-dent Senate, the Unite platform is something every Gator can be proud of.  
From recovering two dollars from every 
parking ticket to constructing a ‘students only’ parking garage, to expanding printing access across campus, to establishing a 24/7 study facility on campus, we are fighting for actual student concerns.Even though I stand firmly by the Unite 
Party platform, I also still stand by my pledge to support the best ideas regardless of party. I support online voting, expanding paper recy-cling across campus and eliminating SG lob-
byists, all platform points proposed by oppos-
ing parties. 
Yet my party affiliation will not prevent me 
from voting for these ideas when they come up in the Senate, and this is the strength of the Unite Party. Rather than settling for par-tisan bickering and division, Unite is willing to slate candidates who promise to represent the entirety of the student body and its politi-
cal beliefs. 
It’s about time student government started 
working for and not against the students. 
Make it this election.

science sophomore.

UF freshmen Jose Gomez, left, and Chrisi Sanchez play Coldplay’s “Yellow” on their guitars at 
Weaver beach Thursday afternoon.
spring legislation session, it 
would be enacted as of July 1, 2009,  and state universities could begin imposing the fee as 
early as fall. 
Orlando said he believes UF 
will implement the increase this 
fall if possible, and it is likely the increase will be the full 15 percent because of UF’s current budget situation. 
The tuition increase would 
only affect those students who enrolled after July 1, 2007. 
For a full-time, in-state fresh-
man taking 15 credit hours, a 15 percent increase would raise tuition from $1,893.75 to $2,177.85. 
The bill would mandate 
that 70 percent of the revenue generated from the increase go 
toward undergraduate educa-
tion, including decreasing the student-faculty ratio, increasing salaries for outstanding faculty members and increasing course offerings. 
The remaining 30 percent 
would go toward need-based financial aid. 
If enacted, this would be 
the second state-approved tu-ition increase in two years. Last spring, the legislature approved a 5 percent increase. 
Orlando said UF is cognizant 
of the financial difficulties fac-ing students now; however, he 
said even if students with full 
scholarships had to pay the dif-ference incurred by the fee, they would still be getting a better deal compared to other state universities. 
At Penn State, for example, 
tuition for a full-time, in-state 
freshman taking 15 credit hours 
would cost roughly $6,000. 
“It’s an extraordinary deal 
people get here,” Orlando said. 
Orlando said he doesn’t think 
the fee would dampen UF’s ap-peal to potential students. 
“Frankly, we have way, way, 
way more applications than we have openings,” he said.Bill earmarks 70 percent of 
new revenue to undergradswill have another month to prepare the 10 
percent budget cut proposals he requested from them in January.
This will give UF more time to analyze the 
situation, he said.
Instead of being due on March 4, propos-
als will have to be in by April 1, and they will be publicized at the Faculty Senate meeting April 15, he said.
In an interview before the Senate meeting, 
Machen said UF has only submitted requests for infrastructure because those are the only requests it’s been asked to submit so far.
He said he doesn’t expect all of the almost 
40 projects to be funded and has no idea when UF could get the money for the ones that do get funded.
When all is said and done, Machen said 
he’s not expecting the bill to be a panacea for UF.
“My personal opinion, and I’m pretty con-
servative, is that the stimulus package is not going to help our budget situation,” he said.
“There is enough uncertainty, however, 
that I’m gonna lag the roll-out (of budget cut proposals) for a month,” he said.
By then, the state may have a better idea of how much money it might receive from the stimulus and how these could affect the budget. Machen said estimates for the state’s share of the bill range from $2 billion to $29 billion, though $12 billion is a commonly cited 
figure.
But Gov. Charlie Crist’s budget recom-
mendations, set to be released today, should 
include some clues as to how big that number could be, he said.
Even so, the final state budget, which will 
determine the actual size of UF’s budget cuts, won’t be available until the end of the spring legislative session, which concludes May 1.
Machen said at the meeting that another 
variable to consider is the differential tuition bill approved by the state Senate’s Higher Ed-ucation Committee on Wednesday. The bill, if approved by the Legislature, would allow universities to raise tuition by up to 15 per-cent a year until they reach the national av-erage. UF can currently raise tuition on some students, but the bill would allow UF to hike 
all tuition, which could bring in about $24 
million next year, or about $12 million more than tuition hikes could have raised under the existing law.
“It’s huge for us,” Machen said. “It is the 
first time that we will have the ability to semi-regulate our revenues on the tuition side,” he said.
He said UF is also expecting an increase in 
research grants from the stimulus, but they won’t affect UF’s budget.
Among other appropriations, the bill sets 
aside $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health and $3 billion for the National Science Foundation.
UF will be able to compete for grants from 
these agencies, and Machen said faculty are scurrying to prepare grant requests in antici-
pation of the extra funding.
While faculty can 
rejoice in the pros-pect  of more grant 
money, needy students can take comfort in the increases in financial aid.
Funding for Pell Grants will be increased 
by $15.6 billion over two years beginning July 1. As a result, the maximum Pell Grant award will be increased by about $500 to $5,350 for the 2009-2010 year.
At UF, 8,016 students received Pell Grants 
in 2007-2008, said Karen Fooks, director of UF’s Student Financial Affairs.
Nationally, about 5.4 million students re-
ceived Pell Grants in 2007-2008, according to the Department of Education Web site, with a total of $16.2 billion distributed in 2008.The Federal Work-Study Program, which 
had a budget of $1.17 billion in 2008, will also get a $200 million boost over two years under the stimulus package.
In 2007-2008, 1,048 students at UF were en-
rolled in the program, Fooks said.
Nationally, about 793,000 students were 
enrolled during the same period.
A higher education tax credit included 
in the bill will also increase from $1,800 to $2,500, the amount students and their fami-lies can claim for education costs on their tax returns. The change will also make families with higher incomes eligible for the credit, 
which will modify the existing Hope Scholar-
ship Tax Credit.
The new credit, which will go into effect 
this year, will last for two years, according to a Department of Education spokeswoman.
Fooks said it’s too soon to tell how the fi-
nancial aid provisions in the bill will affect UF students but said the most obvious im-pact will come from the increase in Pell Grant 
funding.
In other news, senators at Thursday’s meet-
ing passed a resolution opposing Gainesville 
Charter Amendment 1, which would legalize discrimination based on gender identity. UF’s Student Senate passed a similar resolution on Wednesday.
Machen says stimulus funding won’t be a cure-all for budget crisis
system had to log on with their UF ID numbers which, until 2003, were their Social Security numbers.
Sikes said UF, like many other 
universities, used Social Security 
numbers for identification until it 
realized the vulnerabilities of that method.
She said most of UF’s current 
students would not be affected by the breach because UF stopped us-ing Social Security numbers as UF ID numbers before most of them enrolled.The breach follows one an-
nounced by UF’s College of Medi-cine in November that affected the records of 330,000 people.
Another breach announced by 
UF in June affected about 11,300 former student employees.
Sikes said UF is particularly 
vulnerable to attacks because of its size.
“We have a lot of students; we 
have a lot of information,” she said.
“It’s kind of like monitoring 
the Mexican border,” she said. “At some point someone is gonna slip through.”Linda Foley, founder of the Iden-
tity Theft Resource Center, said the number of data breaches at UF isn’t exceptional.
Other universities have had 
10 or 15 data breaches since 2005, while UF has had five, she said. In 2007, Michigan State announced seven breaches, she said.
She also said UF has taken the 
proper steps to correct the situation 
by attempting to notify those who 
might have been affected, establish-ing a hotline and recommending that people place fraud alerts on their credit reports.
She also said the fact that UF 
announced the breach more than a month after it was reported is not unusual because it usually takes a 
long time to determine how many 
files were compromised.
She also said there is a silver lining for students because many of them have not yet signed up for credit cards or otherwise estab-lished a credit record, which makes them less vulnerable to identity 
theft. It’s harder for identity thieves 
to open credit lines for people with-out credit because those transac-tions attract more scrutiny, she said.
Sikes said UF is working to pre-
vent future privacy breaches by centralizing its computer network, establishing a task force to identify 
potential problems and requiring 
training for employees who handle private data.
Since 2005, UF had five breaches compared to 10 to 15 at other schoolsSTIMULUS , from page 1

UF head coach Kevin O’Sullivan runs to the dugout after meeting with the umpires before the Gators’ 
10-2 loss to FSU at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville on April 1.
� O’SULLIVAN STARTS HIS 
SECOND YEAR IN CHARGE.
By KYLE MAISTRI

No disrespect to the Saints, but 
the Gators are facing quality oppo-nents a little bit earlier this year.
A year ago, UF scheduled 
a three-game series with Siena 
to kick off the new season. The 
Gators swept the Saints right out of Gainesville after scoring 27 runs against the overmatched Metro At-
lantic Athletic Conference squad.
UF welcomes No. 23 Louisville 
to town tonight, and the unani-
mous selection to finish first in the Big East is likely to put up slightly 
more resistance.
“The best way to describe them 
is they’re a complete club,” UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. 
Junior Justin Marks, the 2009 
Preseason Big East Pitcher of the Year, brings his 18-4 career record and 2.53 ERA to the bump on Fri-day to match up with UF’s Patrick Keating.
Keating, who emerged as the 
Gators’ ace last season, paid the Cardinals a bit of a backhanded compliment before practice on Thursday.
“They’re a good team. They’re 
all over the polls,” he said. “I would say they’re almost like an SEC team.”
The senior hurler meant no dis-
respect to Louisville, but it was clear he thinks tough competition is nothing new for him or UF.
Cardinals junior third baseman 
Chris Dominguez is one of the hitters Keating and the rest of the pitching staff have paid a lot of at-tention to on film.
Louisville’s slugger hit .365 
with 21 home runs and 75 RBIs last season.
UF freshman Nick Maronde, 
who is scheduled to start in Game 3 on Sunday, said that part of the reason he chose to be a Gator is be-cause the coaching staff encourages UF to face Louisville 
in season opener

Following UF’s win against Alabama on 
Wednesday night, coach Billy Donovan de-
fended his team’s effort this season.
He said it was unfair to compare this 
group to Gators teams of the past and that 
it is  unrealistic to expect them to play to the 
kind of standard set by two national titles.
Don’t blame the players for stealing a 
glance at those crystal balls every once in a while, though. It can be hard to forget when history is just a phone call away.
“I always talk to Jo (Noah) and Al (Hor-
ford) and all of those guys. They call to check on us,” guard Walter Hodge said. “When 
we lose, they call and ask what happened.”
Donovan said he hopes the team doesn’t 
feel weighed down by expectations.
For Hodge, the group’s lone senior, it’s 
hard to ignore the past.“You don’t have to do the stuff the guys 
before you did, but you have to live to a 
standard,” Hodge said. “You’re at the Uni-versity of Florida. You come here to win.” 
Hodge said he still hopes to do some-
thing special with this group before his time 
in Gainesville is over.
An NCAA Tourna-
ment appearance and a run at a Southeastern Conference title are still within reach, but with the season winding down, UF can hardly afford a 
misstep when it plays Vanderbilt on Satur-
day at 3 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.
“NCAA Tournament, first place in the 
SEC, all that stuff — yeah, I loved talking 
about that when I had Noah and Horford and Brewer, who understood everything that went into it,” Donovan said. “These Hodge tries to emulate pastBrandon McArthur’s hair is lon-
ger now, long enough to hide the 
painful memories underneath.
When he shaves it short — and he 
said he will when the time is right — the 
long scar on the left side of his scalp will remind him of the brain surgeries from 
five years ago.
He’s also got the scars on his arms 
from the Tommy John surgery and a 
right knee still “in the process” of heal-
ing from a torn ACL last season.
That all goes out the window Friday, 
though. That all leaves his mind as the 
baseball team opens its season against Louisville.
The team may be entering its second 
season in the Kevin O’Sullivan era, but it’s entering its sixth in the Brandon McArthur epoch.
Old man McArthur, a fossil at age 24, 
just realized the other day that some of his teammates were born in the 1990s.
“When I started playing baseball, 
they were born,” McArthur said. “They 
joke on me every now and then about 
how old I am.”
Two devastating, season-ending inju-ries — one on the field of play, the 
other off — have 
given him a sixth year of eligibility. 
His story makes 
him easy to cheer 
for, and it’s one 
I grew familiar with last season when I wrote a 
feature about him. I remember him star-
ing out at home plate from the dugout 
during batting practice, rarely taking his 
eyes off the game he loves. I remember his mother, Valerie Bullock, calling me 
in tears one day after our first interview 
to tell me more about her son’s emotions after his freshman-year injury. I remem-ber watching him burn down the first-base line to beat out a ground ball only 
to have the ACL in his right leg give out 
before his effort did.
“It hurt,” McArthur said. “It hurt 
like, ‘Why is this happening again?”
In the press box that night, I found McArthur worthy of cheers

There’s no place like home.
The Gators clicked the heels of their orange-and-blue tennis 
shoes and will return home after indoor stretches that proved wicked.
The men’s and women’s tennis teams were both 1-3 in their 
recent quartets of road matches that included the Intercolle-giate Tennis Association Indoor Championships in Chicago and Madison, Wis., respectively.
Each squad hits the friendlier confines of Linder Stadium 
this weekend, beginning at 3 p.m. today when the No. 11 men host South Florida. The Gators (6-3, 0-1 Southeastern Confer-ence) are a perfect 5-0 at home. They boast a 42-3 series record against the Bulls (4-2).
As UF men’s coach Andy Jackson predicted after Alex La-
croix’s third straight win over a ranked opponent this spring, the sophomore is now No. 21 in national singles rankings. Freshman Carlos Cueto is not far behind at No. 24.
The No. 12 women take on Troy at 3 p.m. on Saturday. The 
match was originally scheduled for 5 p.m. but was moved up due to chilly forecasts.
The Gators (5-3) are led by the SEC Women’s Player of the 
Week, Marrit Boonstra. The junior’s three consecutive wins over ranked opponents last weekend catapulted her from No. 34 to No. 7 in the singles rankings.
“She can compete her way out of (a deficit) and win the first 
set regardless of whether she’s on the top of her game or not,” UF women’s coach Roland Thornqvist said.
“That, I think, is the mark of a champion. You gotta be able 
to play and compete regardless of whether you are playing 10 out of 10 or five out of 10.”
That competitive nature has kept Boonstra on Court 1, 
where she toppled the No. 17, 31 and 38 singles players at the ITA Indoor, dropping only one set — a 7-5 one at that.
“Obviously, her game has grown (since last year), but she’s 
showing a lot more maturity as a competitor this year, too, which she has to, playing at the top court,” Thornqvist said.
On Sunday, the UF men will play another in-state rival as 
No. 24 Miami comes to town. 18, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2009
UF GYMNASTICS
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
Gators fans may be in for a treat  
when UF hosts No. 8 Alabama to-
night at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
“It’s great gymnastics, probably 
the best set of gymnastics in the 
O’Dome this year,” UF coach Rhon-
da Faehn said.
As if winning wasn’t incentive 
enough, the No. 6 Gators (4-2, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) are fur-ther excited by the prospect of facing the nation’s eighth-ranked team.
“No matter who I compete 
against, I try to make it an impor-
tant meet each time,” senior Corey 
Hartung said. “But obviously if it’s Georgia or Alabama or a top school, you want to go out there, and you know you have to do your best to beat them.”
The Gators are coming off a mo-
rale-boosting win against Michigan State on Feb. 14, when they scored a season-high 196.85.
“Last weekend was our starting 
point, and the only way we’re going to go from here is up,” Hartung said. “We’re going to build off of how well we did last weekend. We proved (to) ourselves we could do it. Even a 
lot of the girls said 
it felt that great to have a meet like 
that.”
One of the 
highlights of the 
Michigan State meet, and some-thing the Gators need to maintain 
to have a chance against the Crim-son Tide, is team chemistry. 
“For me, knowing that my team 
is behind me and can trust me makes me feel like I can do that much bet-ter,” Amanda Castillo said.
If the Gators want to come out 
with a win against arguably their toughest competition so far this sea-son, they will have to start by prac-
ticing hard.
“What they do in the practice 
has to be done in the competition,” 
Faehn said. “You can’t slop through a turn and expect, ‘It’s OK, it’s not going to happen in the meet.’ It’s not going to happen out there in the competition if it doesn’t happen here in the gym.
“The practices were hard,” Faehn 
continued. “They were really hard Monday and Tuesday. They did more (repetitions) and they didn’t have that extra day to recover.”
UF’s home meets are normally 
held Friday nights, but the Michigan State meet was on a Saturday. 
Some overly aggressive mistakes 
against the Spartans cost UF some tenths, tenths that could prove the difference against Alabama.
“Alabama and Florida has al-
ways been a great rivalry,” Castillo said. “It’s definitely one of the stron-ger competitions.”
� THE WOMEN’S GOLF TEAM HAS BEEN 
TRAINING ON THE COURSE, NOT THE RANGE.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
Much like a baby learning how to walk, the inexperi-
enced UF women’s golf team stumbled to the ground in 
its first event of the season.
Now it’s time for the team to pick itself up.After a mediocre performance at the Northrop 
Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes, Calif., the team will travel to South Carolina on Sunday to play in the Kiawah Island Intercollegiate.
“We have been working really hard since California, 
and we have learned a lot and spent a lot of time working on our game mentally,” freshman Andrea Watts said.
In Palos Verdes, UF faced some of the best teams in 
the nation. In this tournament, the roles are switched. 
The No. 29 Gators will be the highest-ranked team 
participating in the event.
“We’ve faced the best in California and we placed in 
the middle of the pack,” she said. “Now we are going to South Carolina, where we are one of the top-ranked teams out there, so obviously that is going to be a big confidence boost for us.”A win for the Gators will not come easily, however. The course is next to the ocean, so wind is expected.“Any time we play on a new course, there are obvi-
ously certain challenges to overcome,” Watts said.
To prepare for those challenges, the team has made 
an adjustment to the way it practices. Instead of practic-ing at the driving range, UF has been practicing on the golf course.
“I think the best way to prepare for a tournament is to 
just go out there and play like you would when you’re in 
a tournament setting,” she said. 
“I think we are all going to benefit 
from playing more than we give it credit for.”
Sophomore standout Jessica Yadloc-
zky agrees.
“When you get on the course, you are 
picking out targets and you’re scoring,” she said. “That’s the most important part of the game.”
UF will send out a lineup of Evan Jensen, Watts, Yad-
loczky and Nicole Schachner in South Carolina. The fifth 
and final spot in the lineup has not been determined.
After the competition they faced in Palos Verdes, the 
young Gators have seen the best that college golf has to 
offer. They will attempt to use that to their advantage in South Carolina as they try to dust themselves off and pick themselves up off the ground.Chemistry key against Alabama

myself upset. As much as we’re taught to be 
neutral in sports writing, you’d have to be heart-
less to be neutral toward his plight. If the base-
ball team loses every game it plays this season, it won’t bother me a bit. But if McArthur has to suffer through another season with a ruinous injury — even if he can play through it like he 
did last year — I might take it pretty hard.
He’s taking advantage of the extra time in 
school, enrolling in post-baccalaureate classes 
in criminology to prepare for a career in the FBI if baseball ever fails him. 
And he’s still optimistic about his chances in 
the MLB Draft this summer. Despite all that’s happened to him, he’s not willing to give up a shot at the majors.
The team is ecstatic to have him back. McAr-
thur represented the entire roster at the men’s basketball game on Wednesday, inviting every-one in the O’Connell Center to come out and watch his team compete for an SEC title, pour-ing his heart into every word.
The people in charge could have chosen 
anyone to talk to the O’Dome crowd: a veteran with better stats like Matt den Dekker or Avery Barnes, an up-and-coming youngster like Josh 
Adams or even coach O’Sullivan.
Instead, McArthur got the nod.
And he’s no slouch at the plate, either. 
McArthur had the third-best batting average on the team in 2008 and finished the year with 44 
RBIs.
But his leadership role on the team cannot 
be underestimated, and O’Sullivan was active-
ly encouraging him last season to appeal to the NCAA for his sixth year of eligibility.
“All the coaches put that bug in his ear and 
said, ‘Hey, we’d love to have you back for one more year,” O’Sullivan said. “‘We know it’s 
been tough on you, but we’re trying to get this 
thing going in the right direction, and you can 
make our jobs a heck of a lot easier.’”
The coach also has McArthur tell each in-
coming group of freshmen his gut-wrenching tale of comeback after comeback, wanting them 
to learn about perseverance and keeping a posi-tive attitude.
“Hopefully they’re listening,” O’Sullivan 
said.
The freshmen have to be listening. McAr-
thur’s story is impossible to ignore.EVAN , from page 17
guys need to understand team 
chemistry first. We’re trying to build it back up, but I don’t know if you just bring another seven or eight guys into your program and that 
just happens. It has dropped off. 
That’s the reality.”
Last season, Donovan grew dis-
illusioned with the lack of effort he saw in practice. He grew tired of a team that appeared to feel entitled.
As a result, he kicked the play-
ers out of their multi-million dollar practice facility during their season-
ending run in the NIT.
This season, however, effort has 
never been the problem. Donovan 
has praised his team’s work ethic, saying his young squad has “given me everything they have.”
Talent, not desire, may be this 
group’s downfall.
“I don’t know how you can have 
five freshmen coming off the bench and expect them to come in here and be terrific. There’s not one McDon-ald’s All-American or one pro that’s on our team in that class right now,” Donovan said. “How we finish up, the result might be the same, but it’s not going to be because of last year’s reasons.”
OGILVY READY TO GO:  During UF’s 
first meeting with Vanderbilt this 
year, the Com-modores were hurt by the ab-sence of center A.J. Ogilvy, who was pulled out of the game half-
way through the first half with a foot injury.
The sophomore has healed and 
will be on the court against the 
Gators on Saturday.
“He was not the normal player 
that he is health-wise, and it was certainly very evident to see that,” Donovan said. “He’s one of the bet-ter frontcourt players in our league, and we’re going to have to try and handle him with more than one per-son.”Gators to face healthy Ogilvyits pitchers to attack hitters, which 
will be the game plan against a tough lineup this weekend. 
“(O’Sullivan) has a very aggres-
sive stance on pitching,” the left-hander said. “He wants to go after hitters and not pitch around them, and that’s how I’ve always pitched 
and that was a major selling point for me.” 
Alex Panteliodis, another fresh-
man lefty, will start Game 2 for UF 
on Saturday.
This is O’Sullivan’s second year 
as the coach of the Gators, and his 
new freshman class has created a 
lot of hype without ever playing a single inning in orange and blue. 
However, O’Sullivan said it’s 
the experienced players who will give UF its best chance to win against Louisville and for the rest of the season. “A lot of hype is made about the 
new guys, but it’s the older guys who need to be talked about,” he said. 
“Brandon McArthur and Avery 
Barnes coming back for another 
season is huge. Those guys are like 
five-star recruits in my mind.”
McArthur and Barnes are both 
seniors coming off productive seasons for the Gators. McArthur, who will start at first base, hit .337 and drove in 44 runs, while Barnes, who will start in left field, led the team with a .360 average, a .434 
on-base percentage and 26 stolen 
bases. 
Junior Matt den Dekker was 
named a Preseason All-America by Baseball America and will 
make his first opening-day start as 
a Gator in center field.Though hype surrounds freshmen, O’Sullivan touts returning veterans

Two straight UF losses snow-
balled to three in a hurry Thursday 
night.
This one wasn’t supposed to 
happen.
Arkansas (16-11, 5-7 Southeast-
ern Conference) eliminated any 
outside shot the No. 15 Gators (22-
5, 8-4 SEC) may have had at an SEC 
regular-season title with an 83-74 upset in the O’Connell Center.
The Razorbacks, who have now 
won four straight games, returned the favor for their 16-point loss to 
UF in Fayetteville, Ark., on Feb. 1, 
halting UF’s 14-game home win-ning streak and undefeated record 
at home this season.
“Just really disappointing with 
our lack of consistency and abil-ity just to play with toughness on 
either end of the floor,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. “We’re just 
not being aggressive enough, and 
it’s really hard to understand why that’s happening.”
UF trailed from the start and 
led for just 16 seconds the entire game, struggling most of the night 
to find enough energy to fight back from deficits.
Marshae Dotson scored the first 
9 points for UF and finished with 
20.
Meanwhile, Sha Brooks, who 
had two fouls in the first six min-utes, tried to keep her team alive. She led all scorers with 27.
But UF failed to have balanced 
scoring — only four UF players 
were on the board 
at halftime. 
UF cut the lead 
to 4 on a Steffi So-rensen 3-pointer 
with 32.3 seconds left in the game 
after being down 11 with 1:20 re-maining, but it was too little, too late.
UF will now try to redeem itself 
on Sunday at 1 p.m. against South Carolina (10-14, 2-9 SEC).
Butler knows that redemption is 
not going to come easily, though.
“The most frustrating part 
about it is the only thing that’s go-ing to get you out of a losing slump in this league is toughness and 
fight,” Butler said. 
“At this point in the year, the 
toughest teams are the ones that are going to continue to excel or 
begin to excel.”20, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2009

UF SOFTBALL

The UF softball team’s journey to Califor-
nia was more than just a chance to play some 
of the top teams in the country. It gave many Gators originally from the Golden State an opportunity to shine in front of their fami-lies and friends.
No. 2 UF (9-1) used a 5-run fifth inning 
to top No. 14 Fresno State (3-2) 8-0 in the Gators’ first game of the Cathedral City Classic in Palm Springs, Calif. 
UF scored its 8 runs on five hits from five different players, four of whom were native Californians.
The game, played in a replica of Boston’s 
historic Fenway Park, was UF’s seventh straight mercy-rule victory and eighth shut-out of the season.
Left fielder Francesca Enea, originally 
from Woodland Hills, Calif., got the Gators off to a quick start, sending a 2-run shot out of left-center field for her team-leading 22nd and 23rd RBIs of the season.
Second baseman Aja Paculba, who 
walked in all four of her plate appearances in her new leadoff spot, scored on Enea’s fifth long ball of the season.“When it happened, the first thing I 
thought was, ‘My parents and my sister got to see that,’ so it meant a lot,” Enea said.
The Gators had a comfortable 5-0 lead 
over the Bulldogs when 
Megan Bush stepped to the plate in the top of the fifth. Her 3-run homer, her first of the season, flew into the replica Green Monster and put the game out of reach.
“I could kind of tell 
right when I hit it that it 
was gone,” Bush said. “After the tone had already been set (by Enea’s home run), that just kept it going that we weren’t done.”
Third baseman Corrie Brooks record-
ed a hit for the sixth straight game, as she knocked in 2 runs on a two-out double to center field in the fifth.
Sophomore Stephanie Brombacher im-
proved to 5-0 on the year, allowing only three hits and walking just one batter while striking out two. Brombacher has still not al-lowed a run this season.
The Gators’ second game of the night, 
which started at 11:30 p.m. against No. 3 Arizona State, was not completed by press time.

Please excuse Patrick Keating. 
He gets a little emotional.
It’s not that he tries to show 
up the other team, and it’s not 
that he can’t handle failure on the mound — UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan preaches the impor-
tance of mound presence to all of 
his pitchers.
“If you show emotion with 
failure, people are going to be running up to home plate to hit 
another one off of you,” Keating 
said.
Success fires him up. Execu-
tion fires him up. Inning-ending 
double plays and strikeouts with 
runners in scoring position fire him up.
Last season, Vanderbilt came 
to Gainesville for the final three-
game series of the regular sea-
son.
In Game 2, the Gators took a 
5-3 lead into the ninth behind a 
strong seven-inning performance 
from starter Stephen Locke. Josh Edmondson relieved Locke and took the game into the ninth, when he allowed runners to reach 
the corners with just one out. 
O’Sullivan went to his bullpen 
and brought in Keating, his No. 1 
starter, to finish the contest.
“It was a big part of the season 
because that game guaranteed us to get into the postseason,” Keat-ing said. 
The junior starter got the first 
batter to ground out to third base, which brought in a run and ad-vanced the tying run to second.
Next up for the Commodores 
was Pedro Alvarez, the eventual No. 2 selection in the 2008 MLB 
Draft.
“That might have been the 
hardest (Keating) threw all year,” 
O’Sullivan said. “That was a mo-ment, that was a moment for him, 
facing one of the best if not the 
best hitter in the country.”
Keating went right at the big-
hitting third baseman and fanned 
him after a seven-pitch battle. Six 
of those pitches were strikes.
“That was the most competi-
tive I’ve ever seen him,” reliever Tony Davis said. 
“That was really cool to watch 
because it was something where he didn’t have one ounce of fear in him, and that’s really cool to 
see.”
Setting a Standard
That strikeout was a memo-
rable moment for his teammates 
as well as Gators fans, but punch 
outs aren’t what excite the de-
monstrative Keating most.
“Double plays get me the most 
fired up,” he said, eyes lighting 
up.
He knows exactly the pitch he 
likes to throw when he needs to 
induce that perfect ground ball. He only asks that it not be pub-lished in the paper.
He’s a competitor, after all.“He takes it very seriously out 
there,” said freshman hurler Nick Maronde, who begins the season as the No. 3 starter. 
“Even during drills, his de-
meanor shows how intense he is.”
Keating likes to come into 
each game with a plan, although he tries not to overanalyze things and sticks with a simple one. 
“As a starter, you’re trying to 
conserve your emotions a little 
bit,” he said.Firing up the troops has a time 
and a place. 
Energy and passion are im-
portant to the mental side of the 
game, but Keating’s game is just as tight on the physical side. 
O’Sullivan, who was heralded 
as a pitching coach with Clemson 
before taking the head coaching 
job with UF last season, described Keating as a guy who doesn’t back down, isn’t afraid of contact, 
makes 
h i s fast-ball move, t h r o w s 
his off-speed pitches for 
strikes and keeps the defense happy by working fast and put-ting the ball in play.
Last season, all those compo-
nents translated to an 8-1 record, a 4.16 ERA and a strikeout-to-walk ratio of better than 2 to 1. 
In the SEC — a conference 
known for baseball talent — he was even better. 
He lowered his ERA to 3.28 on 
his way to a 7-0 mark, including 
a complete game against LSU in 
which he allowed just 1 run and struck out six.
“The big thing about the Fri-
day-night guy is that you don’t 
go into your pen too early,” 
O’Sullivan said.
Keating has proven he is ca-
pable of staying on the field, eat-
ing up innings and saving arms 
in the bullpen. 
Hard Work Embodied
With a full year as the staff’s 
most consistent pitcher under his belt, Keating will make the Fri-
day-night starts for the Gators, 
spearheading a rotation that will include at least two freshmen. 
“He’s definitely a leader, 
and he shows us what to do out there,” Maronde said.
Keating has made the transfor-
mation from a young pitcher try-ing to prove himself every time out to a seasoned veteran who others look to for guidance on how to become an SEC starter. 
O’Sullivan said he often uses 
Keating’s story as an example of 
how far a play-
er can 
come over 
the course 
of four years if he stays 
motivated.
In his freshman season, Keat-
ing saw the field for a total of eight outs (2 2/3 innings).
He made the jump to long re-
lief as a sophomore and posted an ERA of 5.79.
It wasn’t until his third year in 
the program, under a new head coach, that he was able to become 
the type of player he is today. 
“Patrick’s been a bulldog since 
day one,” Davis said. “Watching 
him pitch the last two years, he 
brings that mentality. He’s fear-
less, and that’s something that I feed off of him.”
Keating tries to be a player the 
younger pitchers can lean on for 
energy, and he tries to keep them 
on top of their conditioning when they’re not on the mound. 
Even coming off of a stellar 
junior year that earned him First-Team All-SEC honors, UF’s ace steered away from complacency in the off-season.  
He added a change-up to his 
repertoire, which now comple-ments his two-seam fastball and his breaking ball — his out pitch. 
The change-up allows him to 
be more effective against left-handed hitters and use his big curve sparingly, keeping batters 
more off balance.
Poised for an encore perfor-
mance bigger and better than 
his breakout junior year, Keating only offers promises he knows 
for sure he can make good on.  
“We’re going to try to come 
out and give these fans a good 
team to watch. We’ve been work-
ing very hard every time out,” he 
said. 
“You’re not going to come out 
here and see some lazy guys just going through the motions. We’re 
going to come out and play the 
game the right way. We’re going to run the bases hard, and pitch-ers are going to attack.”
UF doesn’t name captains be-
cause O’Sullivan doesn’t want to put that label on guys who may not emerge as leaders as the sea-son unfolds. 
A de facto system of captain-
ship is well-respected among the players, and the same names re-surface when they are asked to 
point out who leads their team 
— Brandon McArthur in the in-field, Matt den Dekker and Avery Barnes in the outfield, and Patrick Keating in the bullpen. 
When it comes to setting the 
tone, UF’s coach knows all eyes will be on one person tonight against No. 23 Louisville.
“We always say there’s only 
one place on the field that’s higher than everywhere else, and that’s the mound,” O’Sullivan said.
