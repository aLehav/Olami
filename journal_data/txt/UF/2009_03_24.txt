Lookin’ for Lizards
UF student Chris Grassa looks for green anole lizards at the edge of the Dairy Pond near the North 
Lawn Monday afternoon. Grassa’s friend is studying the spread of brown anoles and their affect on the green anole population in Florida. He lamented the overcast sky, as the lizards come out to sun themselves on warm days.

A bill that would force stu-
dents to pay back Bright Futures 
money for classes they drop after the Drop/Add period would 
save the state about $47 million 
in 2009-2010, according to a new cost estimate.
The estimate, released last 
week, predicts that more than 312,000 credit hours will be dropped by college students in Florida in 2009-2010.
If the state was reimbursed for 
those hours, it would save about $30 million. The other $17 mil-lion in savings would come from the part of the bill that increases the number of credit hours per year students need to take to be eligible for the full Bright Futures scholarship from 12 to 24.
Gov. Charlie Crist’s budget 
for next fiscal year includes about $481 million for Bright Futures.
According to UF officials, im-plementing the bill at UF would cost $250,000 for system modifi-cations in the first year as well as $150,000 annually for staff.
Incoming UF Student Body 
President Jordan Johnson, who said Bright Futures and budget 
cuts will be the focal points 
of his presi-dency, which begins this summer, said he agrees that 
Bright Futures 
needs to be 
pared down 
but said this bill is not the way 
to do it. 
Students should be allowed 
to drop a class later in the semes-ter without being punished if they’ve signed up for more than they can handle, he said. 
“No one’s perfect,” Johnson 
said. 
Instead, he said he’d like to 
see standards for the scholarship raised.Bill may save

The battle lines are long-drawn.
For weeks Charter Amendment 1 sup-
porters and opponents have struggled over the minds of Gainesville voters.
And today, for one side, all of the ef-
fort will amount to defeat and an unhappy 
future.
In addition to the controversial amend-
ment, voters will also decide on two elect-
ed officials and an additional amendment to the Gainesville City Charter.
For the At-Large 1 seat, incumbent City 
Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa, who 
opposes Amendment 1, faces four chal-
lengers: Richard Selwach, Tom Cunilio, Robert Krames and James B. Schlachta.
All four challengers are in favor of Charter Amendment 1, which would nul-lify Chapter 8 of the Gainesville Code of Ordinances, titled “Discrimination.” In-
stead, protections would be provided by 
the Florida Civil Rights Act at the state ELECTIONSCandidates, activists prepare for election results

After nearly two months of in-
tense campaigning, Gainesville 
City Commission candidates will draw the curtain on election sea-son today.
From socializing with support-
ers to holding signs on street cor-
ners for a last minute pitch to vot-
ers, each candidate has a plan for their final campaign day. 
At-large Gainesville City Com-
mission incumbent Jeanna Mas-trodicasa plans to watch today’s 
election coverage at Gainesville’s Star Garage. After the results are 
in, she said 
she will head 
to The Top 
restaurant as she did after 
she won her three-year term in 2006. 
“We had a really good time. Ev-
eryone there was very receptive,” she said.
She said she would go to The 
Top, win or lose.
“I may have to drink my sor-
rows away,” she joked.
Mastrodicasa said she hopes 
her supporters will come to enjoy the night with her.
“It’s going to be an open place,” 
she said. “Come on along!”She will also try to make a stop 
at Brophy’s Irish Pub, where the anti-Amendment 1 community 
plans to await the results.
Scherwin Henry, the incumbent 
for District 1, will spend election night with family, friends, donors 
and supporters at Matheson Mu-Campaign ends, candidates plan local watch parties

UF startup invited to meet with Obama
Deepika Singh, president of UF start-up 
company Sinmat, bought a plane ticket and 
headed for Washington, D.C., where she was praised Monday, along with representatives from other “clean energy” companies, by President Barack Obama.
The event was part of an announcement of 
billions of dollars in clean energy appropria-tions in the new federal budget.
“Innovators like you are creating the jobs 
that will foster our recovery,” Obama said during the event.
Sinmat, a 15-employee company cofound-
ed about five years ago by Deepika and her husband, Rajiv, a UF materials science and engineering professor, develops technology that makes lighting more efficient, Rajiv said.
It was created after the couple licensed 
technology developed at UF, he said.
“It was a great honor to be invited and 
recognized,” Deepika wrote in an e-mail after the event.

Fla. men face assault charges in fatal Colo. fight
STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, 
Colo. (AP) — Two brothers from Florida face assault charges in Colorado after a fight that au-
thorities say led to the death of a 
Special Forces soldier.
Routt County District Attor-
ney Elizabeth Oldham on Mon-
day filed charges of second- and 
third-degree assault against 
27-year-old Eduardo Capote Jr. 
and third-degree assault charges against 23-year-old David Ca-pote. They haven’t entered pleas 
and their hometown wasn’t im-
mediately known.
Authorities say the Capotes 
got into a fight with Sgt. 1st Class 
Richard Lopez outside a Steam-
boat Springs bar in January. An 
autopsy report said the 37-year-old Lopez was struck twice in the face before he fell, hitting the back of his head on the ground and suffering fatal head and brain trauma.

Conn. may apologize for racist policies of past
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) 
— Connecticut legislators are considering making their state the first in New England to apologize for slavery and oth-er racist policies of old.
A legislative committee 
heard testimony Monday on a resolution that would issue a formal, general apology and express the General Assem-bly’s “profound contrition” for the official acts that sanc-tioned and perpetuated slav-ery hundreds of years ago.
The state’s African-Amer-
ican Affairs Commission, a liaison between black commu-nities and the government, is urging legislators to pass the resolution, which it has called “an exercise in reconciliation” and not an effort to determine fault for slavery.
The commission’s legisla-
tive analyst, Frank Sykes, told the legislature’s Government Administration and Elections Committee that “opportuni-ties like this must be seized,” especially in light of the “gi-ant stride” the country took last November in electing its first black president, Barack Obama.
“While this is encourag-
ing,” Sykes said, “it should inspire us and challenge us LOCAL
Campus assault suspect still on loose
Police are still searching for 
a suspect involved in an on-
campus assault of a former UF 
student and employee Friday 
night.
The 21-year-old woman was 
leaving the law school library around 9:15 p.m. when a man 
riding a dark, beach-cruiser 
style bicycle approached her and asked her for money, said University Police Department 
Capt. Jeff Holcomb.
The woman declined to give 
him money, and at some point 
after that the man shoved the woman and she shoved him 
back, Holcomb said. After a brief 
“shoving match,” the woman 
slashed both of the man’s arms 
with an eyebrow trimmer, and he fled west on Southwest Sec-
ond Avenue, Holcomb said.
The woman was not injured.
A search was conducted, but 
the suspect was not found, a 
UPD news release said.
The suspect is described as 
a 20- to 30-year-old white man 
with long hair, about 5 feet 8 
inches tall, according to the re-
lease. He was wearing a white tank top, dark pants, boots and a hat.
The woman was last regis-
tered as a student in the sum-mer of 2008, according to UF’s Office of the Registrar. She had also worked at UF as a student assistant, but her term of em-
ployment ended March 9, ac-
cording to UF’s Office of Hu-man Resource Services.
Holcomb asked anyone with 
information about the crime to call UPD.

A large blue truck parked be-
tween the Plaza of Americas and 
Peabody Hall was soaking up the memories on Monday afternoon. 
The truck was used as a make-
shift video studio for about 30 stu-dents who stopped by to share sto-ries and eat free pizza as a part of the “When Did You Become A Florida Gator?” campaign.
UF sociology senior Ana Her-rera sat on a bench inside the truck, 
the walls of which were covered in 
blue and orange fabrics with an Al-bert the Alligator print, while she thought about her story. 
“It was four years ago, right after 
I got my acceptance letter,” she said. “The next day my stepdad went and switched his car decal from LSU to UF.” 
The truck, which is often used 
to display different advertisements, has been driving around campus since November promoting the new campaign, and cost about $1,300 to 
rent. 
The campaign is run through 
Alpha PRoductions, a student-run 
public relations firm. 
Nicole Baker, a campaign as-
sociate, said the new theme, which follows the The Gator Nation cam-paign, centers on finding Gator fans’ connection to UF. 
“We’re finding out what every-
one’s stories are,” she said. 
UF psychology senior Keren 
Reznika, said she decided to stop by and interview after spotting signs 
for free pizza and drinks near the 
truck. 
She said she considered herself 
a part of The Gator Nation once she celebrated on University Avenue af-ter the 2005 NCAA basketball cham-
pionship.
“We were all on the streets cel-
ebrating together,” she said. “I knew 
that was something we would all remember.”
The videos, which can be viewed 
on insidethegatornation.com, fea-ture stories from past and current students.
“It’s for anyone connected to The 
Gator Nation,” Baker said, adding there are about 400 video interviews on the Web site so far. oN CAmpuS

The store opened in January of 2004, and it provides customers with copying, faxing, packing and shipping services.
Now it’s hosting a contest for students 
in hopes of finding a new name that better 
describes its business.
“The current name is catchy, but it isn’t 
descriptive,” said Charlotte Dare, manag-er of Do It Reitz and the Reitz Union Game Room. Dare and two other Reitz Union em-
ployees will choose the new name for the 
store.
The winner of the contest 
will receive a $50 store credit and a $50 UF Bookstore gift 
certificate.
Participants may submit up to five 
names per entry, and they’re allowed to submit as many entries as they wish.  
Entries can be anonymous, Dare said.

A UF student and a UF employee, a husband 
and wife, were involved in an alleged domestic 
dispute Thursday night at Diamond Village, an on-campus apartment complex for married stu-dents.
As a result of the incident, which happened 
around 8 p.m., Eric Hayden, 29, has been banned 
from his apartment and all UF housing complex-
es until further notice.According to a University Police Department 
arrest report, Venus Hayden, 21, alleges that she was arguing with her husband when he pushed her hard against the front door then put his hand around her neck but did not choke her.
He then opened the door and threw her out 
of the apartment, Venus said in the report.
Eric was arrested and charged with battery, a 
misdemeanor, and taken to the Alachua County Jail, UPD Lt. Robert Wagner said.
A sworn complaint was also filed against Ve-
nus, Wagner said. The complaint was not avail-able by press time.lOcAlMan charged with battery

Starting today, UF students

Free Your PC event staff will 
service computers at tables set up 
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Reitz 
Union Colonnade on Tuesday and 
Thursday, and they will be on the Plaza of the Americas Wednesday. Other software such as Firefox, Open Office and Thunderbird will 
be offered to passers-by for instal-

Each semester for more than 
four years, Florida Free Culture, 
a student group at UF, organizes 
the Free Your PC event to educate people about open-source soft-ware, said Mark Sisley, president 
of the group.
Anyone can contribute to the 
open-source software, allowing 
better ideas to emerge, and it’s 
much cheaper than manufactured 
software that can’t be 
altered, he said.
“Sometimes a com-
munity can create 
software much better than a com-pany,” said Sisley, adding that he thought buying an overly expen-sive Microsoft Office is pointless 
when you can get a better Open 
Office for free.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Octuplets mother 
Nadya Suleman has fired a nonprofit group of 
nurses that helped care for her children, accus-ing the group of spying on her and reporting her to child welfare officials, her spokesman said Monday.
Suleman attorney Jeff Czech said the rela-
tionship started badly between Suleman and Angels in Waiting, which has been training nannies paid by Suleman at the family’s La Habra home.
Last month an attorney for the Angels in 
Waiding filed a complaint against Suleman with child welfare officials, seeking an investi-gation into whether the mother could provide a suitable environment for her 14 children.
Suleman later had several confrontations 
with the nurses, Czech said.
“It started out adversarial and never really 
resolved itself,” Czech said.‘Octomom’ fires nanny serviceTUESDAY, MARCH 24, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 5

As we drove by the small houses of south-
east Gainesville, with bars on the windows 
and “No Trespassing” signs on porches, I re-
alized I was going into an area of the city I didn’t know existed.
In the police car of Lt. Keith Kameg, I 
rode along Friday to get a firsthand account of a night on patrol with officers from the Gainesville Police Department. 
When we pulled up to a boarding house 
on Southeast Sixth Avenue, some people ran 
away, and others stood firm, mumbling curse 
words at us as we approached. 
Often drug dealers hide their drugs in their 
socks and in the exhaust pipes of nearby cars, 
said Gainesville Police Sgt. Mike Douglas, 
head of GPD’s Tactical Impact Unit. 
The unit was created in 2006 to combat vi-
olent crime and drug dealing and specializes in patrolling Gainesville’s high-crime areas, Kameg said.
As we drove past houses with busted win-
dows and torn-down fences, I realized how separated the student community is from southeast Gainesville.
Kameg said although the area we scouted 
was only 1.5 miles away from downtown, stu-
dents are usually unaware of it.
As we pulled up at “the horseshoe,” a 
name given to Southeast Sixth Street because 
its  curved design lets drug dealers see po-lice approaching from both directions, men 
walked away as they yelled at the officers to 
leave.We walked around a house past a bath-
room shed and saw three people fending off the night’s cold next to an outdoor fire and listening to Earth Wind & Fire’s “Dancing in 
September.”
“You need to go to the White House and 
get Dick Cheney and the real criminals,” one 
of the men said after telling us to go home. 
“There are no criminals here.”
Kameg jokingly replied that Cheney is no 
longer in the White House.
We then walked around the side of the 
house, passing rusty kitchen appliances and stray cats. The officers shined their flashlights 
on two men in lawn chairs and searched them for drugs. On one of the men, they found a small bag of marijuana. 
Quietly and calmly, the officers took the 
man’s fingerprints, gave him a notice to ap-
pear in court and let him go.
The officers were compassion-
ate and friendly, knowing people 
by name and joking with resi-
dents.
Gary, a man carrying a 32-ounce bottle of 
King Cobra beer and wearing a blue jail-like jumpsuit, cursed at the officers.
He got so close to Douglas, I worried Gary 
would punch him. 
Then, suddenly, the two  laughed, and 
Gary hugged Douglas and kissed him on the cheek.
Gary carried on with the officers like they 
were old friends, laughing, joking and catch-
ing up on Gary’s life.
The officers were filming Police Beat, 
GPD’s local version of ‘Cops,’ and police 
coaxed  Gary to go on camera. 
After police spent about five minutes talk-
ing to  Gary, he looked at the camera and 
yelled, “I hate Police Beat!” 
Everyone laughed and Gary agreed to 
a take two, this time saying, “I love Police 
Beat,” and kissing Douglas on the cheek.
Gary didn’t want me to feel left out, so he 
hugged me and kissed me on the neck — a 
perfect ending to my night.GPD ride-along opens eyes

‘Terrible tyrant’ packs powerful punchVote!
Gainesville needs to 
hear your voice
This week Parade Magazine, that renowned para-gon of investigative journalism, published a list of the top 10 “terrible tyrants” next to a full-page 
color ad for those mysterious Amish fireplaces.
Moving up one spot to tenth place in the rankings 
this year was Muammar al-Gaddafi. The leader of Libya for 40 years now, Gaddafi is on the verge of completing one of the most amazing stories of redemption in mod-ern political history.
Al-Gaddafi was once among the most hated men in 
the Western world. He overthrew the Libyan govern-
ment in 1969 and by the 1980s was the leading venture 
capitalist in contemporary terrorism, sponsoring bomb-
ings across Europe and buying all the bootleg nuclear technology he could find.  
Former President Ronald Reagan called him the 
“mad dog of the Middle-East,” but al-Gaddafi was al-
ways more big pimpin’ than bin Laden. Never seen 
without a fresh pair of sunglasses or his platoon of hot female bodyguards in matching fashion camo, Gaddafi  was a relic of the Cold War who most thought would just disappear as the Soviet empire crumbled.
Few observers would have guessed that al-Gaddafi  
would be spearheading African politics in 2009 or that former President George W. Bush would call him in De-cember 2008 and become the first U.S. president to talk to the Libyan leader. 
Bush even sent Condi to Libya in late 2008 to open 
up formal relations, which was pure genius; Gaddafi  called our secretary of state “that darling black African woman” and remains completely sprung to this day.
Of course, this is all about the money. Libya has one 
of the largest proven oil reserves in the world and a crumbling infrastructure. Top European and American firms can’t wait to get at that oil. In addition, being a terrorist state for so long allowed Libya to sit out this recession — they have about $100 billion that they are spending on commercial real estate across the globe.
Money is also how Gaddafi  
got out of the doghouse. Gadd-
afi poured billions into funds set up for the families of the victims of his bombings but only after a push from 
Bush. Maybe W. told him to get a good public relations 
firm, too — Libya just paid the Livingston Group $750K 
for the last six months of its work in helping to rehabili-tate the region in the eyes of the West. Throwing money at problems and hiring a top lobbying firm, Gaddafi has 
learned a couple of new tricks these past few years.
Some habits die hard, though. Gaddafi remains a 
strong adversary of Israel; his plan for a one-state solu-
tion for Israel and Palestine seems misguided at best. Our government, meanwhile, remains committed to selling guns and military technology to pretty much anyone.
The current U.S. ambassador to Libya revealed earli-
er this month that we plan on selling Gaddafi nonlethal weapons and training immediately, with lethal weap-ons soon thereafter.  
The French have already welcomed Gaddafi to Paris 
and sold him 14 brand-new fighter jets, so America isn’t quite spearheading this Libyan renaissance story. After 40 years, Gaddafi is proving that the only constant in this world is change — well, that and Arab money.  
Tommy Maple is an international communications 
graduate student. His column appears on Tuesdays.Gainesville city elections are today, and if you haven’t 
voted early, this is your last chance to make your voice heard in what will prove to be a historic election.
Up for vote are two City Commission seats and two 
amendments to the Gainesville City Charter.
The Editorial Board endorses voting no on Charter 
Amendment 1. The controversial amendment would re-move Gainesville’s existing discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity and revert the law back to the Florida Civil Rights Act, which has no protec-tions for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents. The amendment is worded so that it cannot be reversed and also would leave no room, if passed, for further protections – such as veteran status – to be added.
The Editorial Board sees no benefit that can come from 
taking these protections away from a large and important segment of the community. If LGBT residents lose these protections, they can be fired from their jobs, evicted from their homes or denied service at businesses solely based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. The issue is not whether you support homosexuality, but rather if you sup-port  equality for all citizens in Gainesville.
The Editorial Board endorses voting yes on Charter 
Amendment 2, which would require a state referendum vote to convert city–owned land used for conservation, recreation or cultural purposes to another use. Simply put, if passed, this amendment would make it more difficult for public land used for those purposes to be rezoned to, for example, com-mercial use and sold to private investors.
Gainesville residents deserve to reap the benefits of land 
used for culture, conservation and recreation. It is important that we protect this land lest it be rezoned and sold to the 
highest bidder.
For Gainesville City Commission District 1, the Edito-
rial Board endorses incumbent Scherwin Henry. While his 
undecided stance on Amendment 1 is disconcerting at best, Henry’s pledge to support responsible business expansion couldn’t come at a better time. With both local businesses and chain establishments closing their doors at an alarming rate, it’s time to regain control of our community. 
Henry’s support of local youth and public aid programs 
also strikes the Board’s fancy. With subsidized housing tak-ing a hit in our faltering economy, a significant portion of dis-advantaged families find themselves with nowhere to turn as they are forced out of their homes. Henry has a proven track record of working with Gainesville’s Community Re-development Agency to pump funding into areas that need it most.
For Gainesville City Commission At-Large Seat 1, the Ed-
itorial Board wholeheartedly endorses incumbent Jeanna 
Mastrodicasa. Mastrodicasa was first elected in 2006 and 
has been working concurrently as a UF administrator and 
city commissioner. She believes in striking a compromise be-tween key groups in Gainesville – students, residents at large and local businesses. Mastrodicasa’s platform focuses on re-sponsible handling of the city’s budget shortfalls and smart investing of the city’s resources. What the Board likes most about Mastrodicasa is her commitment to the  thousands of UF students that comprise a huge chunk of her constituency. Her ties with UF help her stay in the loop with matters affect-ing this important voting bloc, which has been increasingly active in elections over the past few years. 
No matter whether you agree or disagree with the Editori-
al Board’s endorsements, we implore you to get out and vote. In order for our government to continue to serve its citizens, we must let our opinions be heard.

Guest column
This column is written in rebuttal to 
the dean’s assertion that Geology is a drain on the resources of UF because 
of the low number of Ph.D.’s and under-graduates. 
Geology is a found major. Most incom-
ing students to UF seek traditional majors because they have little exposure to the geo-logical sciences. Nearly every single major is a student who took a geology class to fill a general education requirement and said “Hey, this is a perfect major for me.”  
Before UF instituted the 120 hour rule, 
the size of the undergraduate geology pop-
ulation at UF was larger. Unfortunately, I 
see at least a dozen or more students every year who want to change majors, but are not allowed to change because of the number of credits they have already earned. Can you imagine finding your life’s passion and then being told you cannot pursue that passion because you found it too late?  
In spite of the hurdles thrown in front of 
our majors and potential majors, the geolo-gy undergraduate numbers have doubled in the last five years. Large numbers of majors are a good thing, but one of the nice things about having a smaller number is that our undergraduates get to know and work with faculty members on research proj-ects. Nearly every undergraduate has worked (or will 
work) on a research 
project as part of their curriculum.  
Lastly, there must be an infrastructure 
in place to handle an increasing number 
of majors. Lab space, instructors, etc., must exist before we can handle larger numbers. Major space for laboratory and teaching expansion cannot happen in our building because it is still occupied by the physics 
department (that department with the nice 
new building by the Reitz Union).
In an economy that is struggling today, 
there is still at least one employment bright spot and that is in Earth science disciplines. In this state alone, geologists work in a wide variety of industries ranging from mining, environmental, groundwater, surface wa-ter, construction and nuclear-test monitor-
ing. These industries all rely on the skills of 
highly trained geoscientists. The Geology Gator Nation has far-reaching tentacles that positively benefit our state and nation.  
With a geology degree, our students get 
great jobs, and our success in placing stu-dents in these jobs is unparalleled in CLAS. By any metric you wish to apply, UF is a preeminent school in geosciences. Our fac-ulty is made of internationally respected researchers whose goal it is to see their stu-
dents succeed in helping Florida maintain 
and develop our natural resources and to protect our citizens from geological hazards such as diminishing groundwater resources and pollution.   
The department also brings in a large 
overhead budget that helps support under-graduate and graduate education.  
The Ph.D. program at UF is relatively 
young, yet the trajectory of our program is positive. One of the biggest hurdles we face with Ph.D. students is the fact that many of our master’s students finish and try to de-cide whether or not to get a Ph.D. or go out into the workforce. 
Imagine trying to decide if you want to 
spend 4 to 5 more years being paid a low wage and working your tail off or accept-
ing a $90,000 per year job with a $10,000 to 
$12,000 signing bonus. Yes, that’s what ge-ology master’s graduates are making work-ing in geology. 
Joseph Meert is the undergraduate advisor 
for Geological Sciences and a UF alumnus.
Student earned seat in dental school
I didn’t know that I was lying to my 
child every time I said, “If you work hard 
enough, you can achieve anything.”  
She is graduating cum laude in chem-
istry and has been published in journals; 
she worked hard enough. I’ve learned 
that education is being doled out like sacraments to the over- and underprivi-leged. Middle America won’t be given a swing in the game or even the courtesy of an interview for dental school.  
Much like our leaders, our educators 
are selling their integrity to the highest bidders (nonresident tuition) and my 
children will pay the penalties. Starting 
with her great grandfather, she is is one of 13 in our family who are alumni of UF, all of whom are native Floridians. Where is The Gator Nation’s loyalty now?  
When you gave away the seat she 
earned in dental school to a nonalum-nus, you betrayed her. This is the lasting lesson Genevieve Garris will take away 
from UF.

On average, five people are 
killed by sharks each year, but one 
hundred million sharks are killed by people each year. 
In an effort to protect sharks 
and decrease shark finning, the 2009 Shark Conservation Act is cur-rently passing through the levels of Congress. It was approved by the House of Representatives March 2 and now awaits a response from the Senate.
“It’s pretty obvious who’s the at-tacker and who’s the attackee,” said George Burgess, director of the Flor-ida Program for Shark Research.
People are gradually becoming 
a major threat to shark populations 
and, as a result, the ocean’s ecosys-
tem. 
Sharks frequently get caught in 
gill nets or long lines accidentally.
They drown as a result of not 
being able to move, and pass oxy-gen through their gills, according to Dana Ehret, a UF vertebrate paleon-tology graduate student. 
The act sets specific regulations 
for boats that participate in shark finning. Among these regulations is the prohibition of the removal of shark fins while at sea. Instead, the fin must reach land attached to the shark’s body, decreasing the num-ber of sharks fishermen can catch 
because of storage limitations.“This is a step in the right direc-
tion,” Burgess said. “One we’re very 
happy to see.”
In the past decade, shark finning 
has become a growing threat to 
shark populations as the demand 
for shark fins continues to increase.
For now, fishermen slice off 
sharks’ fins and discard the carcass-es back into the ocean to save stor-age space on the boat. Many times, the injured shark is still alive when it is tossed overboard, and it’s left to die a slow death, Ehret said.
Shark fins are used to make 
shark fin soup, a delicacy in Asian countries with a popular and lucra-tive market. In the U.S.,  shark fins are sold for about $30 a pound.
It is difficult to protect the shark 
population because it is an interna-
tional resource, so countries need 
international agreements, Burgess said.
Another problem facing protec-
tion efforts is the difficulty of en-forcing laws, Ehret said. 
“It’s really hard to protect things 
in the open water,” Ehret said.
“There’s so much water. Who is 
going to go out and patrol what’s on board?”

WASHINGTON  — The Obama adminis-
tration aimed squarely at the crisis clogging 
the nation’s credit system Monday with a plan to take over up to $1 trillion in sour 
mortgage securities with the help of private 
investors.For once, Wall Street cheered.
The announcement, closely stage-man-
aged throughout the day, filled in crucial 
blanks in the administration’s financial res-
cue package and formed what President 
Barack Obama called “one more critical ele-
ment in our recovery.”
The coordinated effort by the Depart-ment of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve 
and the Federal Deposit In-
surance Corp. relies on a mix of government and private 
money — mostly from in-
stitutional investors such as 
hedge funds — to help banks rid their bal-ance sheets of real-estate related securities that are now extremely difficult to assess the 
value of.
The goal, said Obama, is to get banks 
lending again, so “families can get basic con-sumer loans, auto loans, student loans, (and 
so) that small businesses are able to finance 
themselves, and we can start getting this 
economy moving again.”Obama administration plans to help failed mortgages

� THE RESTAURANT CHAIN 
IS BASED IN ATLANTA.

After restaurants such as 
Guthrie’s and Joe’s Deli shut 
down in Gainesville, a new Zax-
by’s is opening up shop.
The popular Atlanta-based 
franchise opened its doors to the public at a downtown loca-
tion at Northwest 10th Avenue 
and Main Street Monday.
Zaxby’s has two other 
Gainesville locations, one on 
Northwest 43rd Street and an-
other on Southwest Archer Road in Butler Plaza. 
Such business expansion seems out of place in today’s economy, but Lisa Swan, as-
sistant manager of the new 
Zaxby’s, said she’s not worried about any of that.
Swan said she was confident 
that popularity of the Zaxby’s brand would be enough to stim-
ulate business.
“Customer ser-
vice is our goal,” 
she added. “Keep 
the customers happy, and 
they’ll keep coming back.”
Josh Ditto, 20, is a resident 
of downtown Gainesville who stopped by for some chicken fin-gers. He said he was excited to hear that a Zaxby’s had opened close by.
“I like their chicken,” Ditto 
said. “I’ll be back.”Zaxby’s expands

level.
In effect, this would remove protected 
status for transgender, lesbian, gay and 
bisexual Gainesville residents and loosen 
protections for other classes.For the District 1 seat, incumbent Sch-
erwin Henry, who advocates responsible business expansion, vies against Marcia Wimberly, who campaigns against waste-ful spending. Wimberly opposes Amend-ment 1, while Henry was still undecided 
at press time.
Charter Amendment 2, if passed, would require a state referendum vote to convert city–owned land used for conservation, 
recreation or cultural 
purposes to another       use.                                  
In a last-minute ef-
fort to raise awareness, a group of parents and their children which oppose Amend-ment 1 spent an hour Monday evening in a 
march along 34th Street.                    
 Equality is Gainesville’s Business, the 
main anti-amendment group, will contin-
ue to reach out to voters tomorrow, said Shelbi Day, the group’s spokeswoman.
“We will be talking to voters until the 
very last minute,” she said.Amendment 2 would require state vote to convert use of protected land
seum.
“We’re just going to bring a joyous end to the occasion — 
win or lose,” he said.
Henry said anyone is welcome at his gathering.
At-large candidate Tom Cunilio said he plans to spend 
part of his day gardening , and then waiting for the results at the Supervisor of Elections Office.
“I’ll be finally planting my spring corn,” he said.
Cunilio said he would rather people show their support 
by voting than attending a party.
“I don’t want pats on the back. I don’t want free drinks,” 
he said. “I don’t have any plans to hang out beforehand. I’m 
not that kind of guy.”
Robert Krames, who is also running for the At-large seat, 
said he will watch the results at the Supervisor of Elections Office, but he will not have an open gathering after the re-sults are in.“It’s a private party. I’m just keeping it to my support-
ers,” he said. “But if anyone wants to come talk about the 
campaign, I’ll be at the elections office at 7.”
At-Large candidate Richard Selwach said he is confident 
about tomorrow’s election results.
“I’m feeling pretty darn good,” he said. “I am the candi-
date with the most experience.”
Not only did Selwach run for Gainesville City Commis-
sion in 2007, but he has been to hundreds of Commission 
meetings, he said. He called himself one of the more contro-
versial attendees.
“I’ll probably be at Mark’s Prime Steakhouse downtown, eating at the bar and having a few drinks with my best bud-
dy Eric Forrest,” he said of election night. “If there is a vic-
tory, drinks will be flowing.”
James Schlachta, an At-large candidate,  said he would 
campaign on street corners today, but he’s not sure if he will make it out on election night.
“If my family doesn’t need me at home with our new 
baby, I will be at the elections office awaiting the results,” he said.
Although Schlachta said he is new at running for office 
and he could have done certain things better, he feels con-fident.
Marcia Wimberly, a District 1 candidate, said in an e-mail 
that she will relax at Flaco’s Cuban Bakery and Deli after the polls close.
“As I reflect on the road to March 24, 2009, tears well in 
my eyes to see it come to a close,” Wimberly wrote. 
She said she trusts that God will watch over the election, 
and that everything will be done fairly and decently.Cunilio, Krames, Schlachta to watch results at Supervisor of Elections officePROTEST , from page 1

WILLOW, Alaska — Alaska’s 
Mount Redoubt volcano erupted 
five times overnight, sending an 
ash plume more than 9 miles into the air in the volcano’s first emis-sions in nearly 20 years.
Residents in the state’s largest 
city were spared from falling ash, though fine gray dust fell Monday morning on small communities north of Anchorage.
“It’s coming down,” Rita Jack-
son, 56, said Monday morning at a 24-hour grocery store in Willow, about 50 miles north of Anchor-
age. She slid her fingers across the 
hood of her car, through a dusting of ash.
Ash from Alaska’s volcanoes 
is like a rock fragment with jag-
ged edges and has been used as 
an industrial abrasive. It can in-jure skin, eyes and breathing pas-sages. The young, the elderly and 
people with respiratory problems 
are especially susceptible to ash-related health problems. Ash can also cause damage to engines in planes, cars and other vehicles.
Alaska Airlines on Monday 
canceled 19 flights because of the ash. In-state carrier Era Aviation canceled four, and Elmendorf Air 
Force Base in Anchorage kept 60 
planes, including fighter jets, car-go aircraft and a 747 commercial plane, in shelters.
Five of 20 Alaska state senators 
were scheduled on the morning flight from Anchorage to Juneau, which was canceled. As a result, 
consideration of a resolution ac-
cepting federal stimulus funds was put off until Wednesday.
The first eruption, in a sparsely 
populated area across Cook In-
let from the Kenai Peninsula, oc-
curred at 10:38 p.m. Sunday and the fifth happened at 4:30 a.m. Monday, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory.
The wind took the ash cloud 
away from Anchorage, toward Willow and Talkeetna, near Mount McKinley, North America’s larg-est mountain.
There were reports of a quar-
ter-inch of ash in Trapper Creek and up to a half-inch at a lakeside lodge near Skwentna.
Dave Stricklan, a hydrometeo-
rological technician with the Na-tional Weather Service, expected very fine ash.
“Just kind of a light dusting,” 
he said. He said the significant 
amount of ash probably dropped 
immediately, right down the side of the volcano.“The heavier stuff drops out 
very quickly, and then the other 
stuff filters out. There’s going to 
be a very fine amount of it that’s going to be suspended in the at-mosphere for quite some time,” he said. 
“The finer ash is going to travel 
farther, and any ash can affect avi-ation safety.”
Jackson said she was taking 
a sip of coffee when she tasted something funny on her lips — ash. She was experiencing other affects, too.
“My eyes are itching really 
bad,” she said as she hurried to get out of the store and to her car.
Jackson, who unexpectedly got 
the day off, hurried home from the 
grocery store to secure a motor-
cycle, snowmachine and vehicles under protective blue tarps.
The 10,200-foot Redoubt Vol-
cano, roughly 100 miles south-west of Anchorage, last erupted during a four-month period from 1989-90.
In its last eruption, Redoubt 
sent ash 150 miles away into the path of a KLM jet and its four en-gines flamed out. The jet dropped more than two miles before the crew was able to restart all en-
gines and land safely. The plane 
required $80 million in repairs.
The volcano became restless 
earlier this year. The observatory 
had warned in late January that 
an eruption could occur at any time.By MALIKA WRIGHT

One student’s opportunity as 
reality show cast member was the 
career booster she always imag-ined.
Terri Darden, a UF sophomore, 
was chosen last semester to be part of the cast of BET’s “College Hill: South Beach.”
After being chosen out of about 
4,000 people, she agreed to live 
in a mansion for $100 a week for 
six weeks without TVs, bedroom doors or communication with people outside of the show.
College Hill is a reality show 
that focuses on the lives of college 
students.
“I prayed that (the show) would 
be used for the greater good of my career,” said Darden, who has 
been singing, acting and dancing since she was very young.
Though she had no idea what 
would take place while filming the show, Darden said she naive-
ly thought all the cast members 
would get along.
“It was the most volatile ex-
perience of my life,” she said. “I 
wouldn’t recommend anyone to 
go out for a reality TV show be-
cause it’s not safe.”
During filming, she got in a 
fight with another cast member. She said the producers of the show didn’t break up their scuf-
fle, and afterward, the producers 
wouldn’t allow her to call the po-
lice.
After the fight, Darden was re-
leased from the show.
“Initially, the cast would have 
gotten along, but the producers 
instigated fights,” Darden said.   
She also said a lot of the show 
was scripted, and producers made them act out situations again un-
til they gave the reactions they 
wanted.
The show isn’t real, she said, 
because it doesn’t capture the es-
sence of real college life.
“In real college, we 
don’t fight,” she said. 
“We are more fo-
cused on graduating 
and finishing school.”
The cast of “College Hill: South 
Beach,” which premieres Tues-day night on BET, were all acting, Darden said.
Most of the cast members 
weren’t in college at the time 
when they were filming, she ex-
plained.
Darden said she isn’t going to 
watch “College Hill” this season.
She said it was a jungle, and 
normal people couldn’t survive 
in it.
“I’m proud to be a Gator, but 
I took off a semester to be on the 
show,” she said.12, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 2009

The 1980 U.S. hockey team 
over the USSR. Villanova over 
Georgetown. The New York 
Giants over the New England 
Patriots.
If the Gators women’s bas-
ketball team (24-7) comes away 
victorious tonight, it might not 
be asking too much to add its feat to this list of greatest sports upsets.
That’s just a taste of what 
No. 8-seed UF will be up against when it steps on the court at 7:11 p.m. in Storrs, Conn., to take on No. 1-over-
all-seed Connecticut (34-0) in 
the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
“They are an incredible 
team,” UF assistant coach Su-
sie Gardner said after Sun-
day’s win against No. 9-seed Temple. “I’m not that old, but I’ve seen some of the unde-
feated teams that have come 
through. The Tennessees, even Texas, the first team that went 
undefeated. I’m not going to 
say this quite yet, but they may be one of the top three teams in 
the history of the game.”
It’s clear the Gators won’t 
need any extra motivation, at 
least none they can’t get from 
just talking about playing the 
Huskies.
When they watched as the 
brackets were revealed just over a week ago, the Gators 
were not happy with their 
seeding or with this poten-tial matchup in such an early round.
Because of that, they’ve had 
a chip on their shoulder.
“It’s actually a motivation 
for us to see actually where we are,” senior point guard Sha 
Brooks said.
Gardner said the team will 
go into this game with a simi-
lar approach to when it played 
Tennessee the first time this 
season in Gainesville.
“Our players are go-
ing to know UConn’s play-ers’ names,” Gardner said. 
“They’ve seen them on TV all 
year. You ask your players, ‘Who would you like to play?’ 
when you’re scheduling, and UF WOMEN’S BASKETBALLGators face No. 1
Give credit where it is due.
Someway, somehow, the 
UF men’s basketball team 
has arisen from the mediocrity.
Certainly this is not as impres-
sive as if the Gators had actually 
turned it on when it really mat-tered, but it’s worth something, right?
“Shocked” doesn’t measure my 
reaction after UF jetted out of the gates Friday night against Miami.
The Gators looked like a po-
tential NCAA Tournament Sweet 
16 team, and the Hurricanes looked like they should have been in the College Basketball Invitational.
Y e a h , 
yeah, I 
know UF plays its best basketball at home. But a 23-4 run to start the game? That’s pretty impressive against any halfway-legitimate team, a category for which Miami certainly qualifies. Miami had quality wins against No. 16 Florida 
State and No. 12 Wake Forest, and 
in one eight-day span lost to No. 2 North Carolina and No. 6 Duke by a combined 7 points.
The biggest factor in UF’s re-
birth is the re-emergence of all-everything point guard Nick Cal-athes.
Welcome back, Mr. Calathes. 
The First Team All-Southeast-
ern Conference performer (and 
quite possibly Player of the Year if Calathes and the Gators didn’t fall apart down the stretch of the regu-lar season) has rattled off 40 points, 12 rebounds and 13 assists in the first two rounds of the NIT.
Inserting Erving Walker into 
the starting lineup instead of Chandler Parsons looked genius against Jacksonville and then like just another roster move against the ’Canes.
It doesn’t really matter for now 
because nothing can be changed or UF finds its 
footing in tournament

■ UF WILL FACE PENN STATE IN THE 
NATIONAL INVITATION TOURNA -
MENT QUARTERFINALS TONIGHT.
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
The UF basketball team has faced more 
than its fair share of criticism this season.
The team has been labeled undersized, 
called out for its lack of toughness and 
chastised for its failure to finish late in close games.
Monday, UF coach Billy Donovan 
threw out a new adjective: overachiev-ing. 
“He feels like we overachieved? Re-
ally?” center Alex Tyus said.
Apparently UF, the same team that 
missed out on the NCAA Tournament and found itself in the National Invitation Tournament for the second time in two seasons, has done more than Donovan ex-pected it to do this year.
“Our guys in a lot of respects have 
overachieved,” Donovan said. “Those guys have won 25 games and done a pret-ty good job. 
“Twenty-five games 
at this point in time in the season is a lot of bas-ketball games.”
UF, which will host 
Penn State (24-11) to-night at 9 in the NIT quarterfinals, is just two 
years removed from winning back-to-back national titles. 
Donovan has coached in the NIT just 
three times in his 13 years in Gainesville, the first coming in 1998. 
“But you also have to look at this 
group and what they’ve been able to do as a team, and although it may not be at the expectation level of some teams, they are trying to get to that point,” Donovan said.
The Gators (25-10) have lost five games 
this season by 3 points or fewer. 
Winning any one of those three games 
would probably have been enough for 
UF to slide into the NCAA Tournament 
field.
“I understand the measuring stick,” 
Donovan said. “You’re always looking to the NCAA Tournament and getting in 
and having a chance to move on and ad-
vance.”
Donovan has tried his best to shelter 
his young team from the expectations set by two national titles.
The coach may be pleased with his 
team’s effort this season, but his players are far from happy with the result of their work. 
“I feel like not making the tournament 
is a disappointment. That’s where we all Donovan believes team has overachievedSEE UCONN, PAGE 19

There were no guarantees the 
lead would hold for the Gators once 
they turned the ball over to the bull-
pen before this last week.
UF’s relief pitching has success-
fully finished off its last five victo-
ries, with the only hitch coming from 
Patrick Keating, usually a starter, on 
Tuesday against FSU.
UF (14-7, 3-3 Southeastern Con-
ference) will need its bullpen to continue to close out games when it 
heads to Jacksonville tonight to take 
on North Florida (8-15).
The bullpen started the season on 
a high note but began to slip during 
the Miami series. Then, Florida At-
lantic came to Gainesville on March 4, and everything fell apart for the relievers. They let 6 runs score in the sixth inning and gave up UF’s 4-0 
advantage.
The bullpen had few problems 
against lowly Duquesne the next 
weekend but faltered again during 
UF’s three-game series against Ar-
kansas on March 13-15, allowing 10 runs in just 14 1/3 innings of work.
At that point, UF coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan had seen enough. It was 
time to talk to his two veteran relief 
pitchers, Tony Davis and Billy Bull-ock.
“We had some heart-to-hearts 
last weekend,” O’Sullivan said. “Sometimes that’s not easy for a coach to do, but we had some seri-ous talks.”
They couldn’t have listened any 
harder to his request for them to re-
focus.
The two have each pitched in 
four of the five games since, resting 
during UF’s 10-2 blowout of Tennes-see on Saturday, and they have com-bined to let up just 2 runs over their 
8 1/3 innings.
“They needed to step up, and 
both guys have had outstanding weeks,” O’Sullivan said.
Their success has poured over 
into to the rest of the bullpen. As a 
whole, they have allowed just 9 runs 
in 23 1/3 innings of work in the last 
five games.
Catcher Buddy Munroe has seen 
a difference in the relievers lately.
“Everyone is going out there 
attacking hitters, which coach O’Sullivan preaches, and everyone is going out there with more confi-dence,” Munroe said.
That confidence has allowed 
them to go after hitters more, and the result has been more ground-ball outs by the pitchers.
O’Sullivan thinks the improve-
ment of the pitching staff could also help another part of UF’s game where the team has struggled re-cently.
“If we (get more ground-ball 
outs) and shorten the counts, the defense plays better, because if 
the counts don’t go deep, the de-
fense won’t get out on their heels,” O’Sullivan said.
When Anthony DeSclafani takes 
the mound to start the game tonight, he will now have the comfort of handing the ball to someone he can 
rely on to finish what he started. He 
was unable to do that when he gave up just one hit during 5 1/3 innings against Florida Atlantic, only to see 
his tremendous start go for nothing.
Now, he will not only have the 
luxury of a bullpen performing at a high level, but also one that has 
a group of guys eager to get their chance to pitch.
“We are more relaxed and ready 
to go,” said Clint Franklin, who tossed 3 2/3 innings in relief on Sat-urday and allowed only one base-
runner. “Everybody just wants to 
get up and throw.”TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 19

UF pitcher Billy Bullock winds up to throw during the Gators’ 2-1 loss to Miami on Feb. 28 at McKethan 
Stadium.
fixed this late in the year, and both players still received 
plenty of playing time.
I doubt Walker is ready to be a full-time starter in the 
SEC next year (if the Gators want to be good again), be-cause he provides such a spark off the bench.
Regardless, UF is doing the important things, including 
outrebounding a supposedly physical Miami team 37-25 on Friday.
But like that man who has been teased by his dream girl 
too many times, it is hard to completely erase the skepti-cism. Three more quality wins and an NIT championship would undoubtedly change that, but I would not be a sin-gle bit shocked if UF turns around and lays an egg against Penn State tonight.
This is where I might consider analyzing the Gators-
Nittany Lions matchup, but I have since realized all the numbers and matchups don’t matter as much with Billy Donovan’s team. The Gators have shown glimpses where they might compete with any team in America, but those periods are often followed by longer stretches that show why they’ve been banished to the NIT and can lose to al-most any decent team.
And Penn State — despite being involved in that ridic-
ulous 38-33 debacle with Illinois on Feb. 18 — could top UF if the Gators don’t show up. 
The fourth-place finisher in the Big Ten hopes to have 
its standout point guard and Big Ten leading scorer, Talor Battle, back in the lineup when it tips off tonight. Penn State defeated current NCAA Tournament Sweet 16-mem-ber Purdue at home on Jan. 6 and swept Illinois, which fell to 12-seed Western Kentucky in the first round of the tourney.
The key to the game is so simple though: Which UF 
squad shows up in the O’Connell Center tonight? 
Just stop the teasing.UF BASEBALLDavis, Bullock lead stronger bullpen into UNF series

they always say UConn.”
It might seem difficult to find a kryptonite to a Hus-
kies team that has an average margin of victory this sea-
son of nearly 32 points and has won every game by no 
fewer than 10.
But Gardner has done her best to name something.“If UConn does have a weakness, which it’s hard to 
find weaknesses, but they’re not overly deep,” Gardner said. 
“Their bench is not that deep, but they don’t play a 
lot of players either. They stay out of foul trouble.”
UF, however, is quite the opposite, and has the abil-
ity to dig through its bench.But it’s almost certain the Gators will need their star 
players on the court for as long as possible if they want to have any chance of pulling off the unlikely upset.
“Sha loves the matchup,” Gardner said. “She always 
plays good against the great guards, and (Renee) Montgomery’s a great 
guard. 
“Steffi’s going to come with her 
confidence and her cockiness, and 
Marshae (Dotson), I think, will step 
up against their post players as well.
“They’ve got an opportunity to live a lifetime dream 
and a one-chance opportunity to play a team that prob-
ably is potentially going to be one of the best teams ever,” Gardner added.
Every underdog needs a chance.Gators’ depth provides sole advantage

“I guess there was something 
good that he thought that we did. 
He mainly felt we were a hard-
working team this year, things just didn’t play out like we wanted to. … We just let some games slip.”
UF lost seven of its last 12 
games this season. 
The Gators became the first 
team since Michigan State in 1980 to miss out on the NCAA Tourna-
ment for two consecutive years after winning a national champi-
onship.
“We did win 10 (conference 
games) this year, but we didn’t make our goal,” guard Nick Cal-athes said.TYUS SAYS CALATHES IS NBA-READY: While the sophomore 
guard has been careful to avoid 
any talk of an early exit from Gainesville, Tyus said Monday that, in his opinion, Calathes is 
indeed ready to make the jump to 
the next level.
“Yeah, definitely,” Tyus said. 
“I see him every day in practice, and his court vision is there. 
“He’s a good shooter, ball han-
dler and one of the most important things is that he’s a great competi-tor, and he always wants to get 
better.”Tyus says Calathes ‘definitely’ ready for NBAWomen's

This week might prove to be a 
glimpse into the future for the Gators.
The No. 26 UF women’s golf team will begin play at the Dixie Classic in 
St. George, Utah, on Tuesday, swing-
ing on the same course where NCAA Regionals will be held in 2011.
“Playing on this course is going to 
help the team because regionals are going to be hosted there in a couple of 
years,” sophomore Jessica Yadloczky 
said. “We are actually going there to get a view of the course for regionals, so we will be prepared.”
But this advantage comes with a 
price. The course is on a desert in Utah and has lava rock lining the fairways and greens.
The Gators have yet to play on a 
course like this all season, which could prove to be a severe disadvantage for the team.
“A lot of the courses that we’ve 
played on have been lush greens and tree-lined,” Yadloczky said.
UF will be the only team from the 
east coast to play in the event, which is something the Gators will have to 
adjust to.
“I think it’s going to be an eye-
opening experience just because it’s 
definitely a different layout than our course that we have here,” Yadloczky said.
If UF is going to have success this 
week, the team will have to play con-sistent golf, something freshman Evan 
Jensen has struggled to do. Through-
out the spring season, she has scored drastically better in the final round of each event.
Jensen has shot a combined score of 
40 over par in the first two rounds of each tournament in the spring, but she has shot a combined score of 1 under par in the final round of each event. 
“Evan has been working really 
hard on it,” Yadloczky said. “She has been playing more, so when she gets out there, it’s easier for her to score right off the bat.”
The Gators’ lineup for the tourna-
ment will consist of Yadloczky, Jensen, Andrea Watts, Lauren Uzelatz and Ni-cole Schachner.
Yadloczky said this week’s event 
will be used to send a message to other teams around the nation.
“Knowing we are the only SEC 
team in this tournament, we know we have to make a stand toward other teams because they are going to be at nationals as well,” she said.20, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 2009

out in the Heat’s 94-82 win against the Memphis 
Grizzlies on Monday night with a bruised right 
hip, something he described as a minor ailment 
that shouldn’t keep him sidelined for long in the Heat’s postseason push.
O’Neal had been bothered by the hip for sev-
eral days, starting when he tried to take a charge last week against the Boston Celtics.
He aggravated the injury in 
Sunday’s win against the Detroit Pistons, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra 
said, and after a pregame huddle with team trainers and physi-cians, the decision was made to give O’Neal the night off.
“It’s definitely just one game, 
just trying to calm it down, just 
because it’s affecting the way I move a little bit and jump and stuff like that,” O’Neal said. “So that’s basically it. It’s nothing to be worried about.”
The Heat entered Monday 3 1/2 games behind 
Atlanta in the race for the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference, and 1 1/2 games up on Philadelphia for fifth place. After Monday, Miami will have 12 
games remaining.
And if O’Neal gets his way, he’ll play in all of 
them.
“We’re not worried about it at all,” O’Neal 
said. “It’s just a precautionary thing. Obviously, I would like to play and the team would like for me 
to play, but it’s the best-case scenario just for this particular day.”
O’Neal has averaged 14.2 points and 5.4 re-
bounds in 17 games since being acquired from Toronto. Miami began the day in fifth place in the Eastern Conference.
He’s also second in charges taken on the Heat, 
despite not coming to the team until past the mid-
way point of the season.
“I’m one of the rare big guys in this league, I’m 
almost sure. I may even lead the league in charg-
es taken (among forward-centers),” O’Neal said. 
“You don’t find a whole lot of that, who really 
puts his body in harm’s way to protect the basket. Sometimes, the negative to that is you’re going to get a couple of nicks and bruises.”MIAMI HEATO’Neal sits
