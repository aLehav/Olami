Counselors explain crisis response protocol
* BEFORE THE SHOOTING
A MENTAL HEALTH EXPERT
TALKED TO ADU-BREMPONG.
By MINCH MINCHIN
and JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writers
Kofi Adu-Brempong was afraid
he was going to be kidnapped, taken
to Africa and slain in a ritual killing.
In the days leading up to his
shooting and arrest on March 2, the
35-year-old Ghanan graduate stu-
dent sent e-mails to the faculty and
staff in the UF geography depart-
ment, accusing them of scheming
to kill him, said Keith Yearwood,
Adu-Brempong's friend and fellowgraduate student.
The recent episode involving
Adu-Brempong, who exhibited psy-
chotic and delusional behavior, has
brought increased attention to the
issues of mental health and campus
safety. The UF Dean of Students Of-
fice has several programs in place to
help students suffering from mental
health problems, said Wayne Grif-
fin, the associate director of the UF
Counseling Center.
One such program, the Critical
Response Team, or CRT, is com-
posed of safety and mental health
professionals including professors,
police officers, counselors and hous-
ing coordinators, he said.
The day before Adu-Brempong
was arrested and shot, a CRT coun-
selor, along with a University PoliceDepartment officer and Adu-Brem-
pong's adviser, visited him at his
apartment in Corry Village for two
and a half hours, according to a po-
lice report.
The counselor, Laura Templeton,
did not get a good chance to talk
with Adu-Brempong
Special and was unable to de-
port termine his overall
mental state, Griffin
said. No counselors
came the night of the shooting be-
cause the situation had become too
volatile and dangerous.
When Templeton met with Adu-
Brempong the day before the inci-
dent, she determined Adu-Brem-
pong did not meet the criteria for the
Baker Act, according to the report.
Had he been submitted under theBaker Act, Adu-Brempong would
have been taken to one of two crisis
units in Alachua County where he
would have remained under ob-
servation for up to three days, said
Bruce Stevens, a professor in the UF
College of Medicine.
Stevens is also a member of the
UF Faculty Senate and the co-presi-
dent of the Gainesville chapter of the
National Alliance on Mental Illness.
As a member of NAMI, he is an
instructor for the Alachua County
Crisis Intervention Team, or CIT,
an organization that trains police of-
ficers and 911-dispatch operators to
handle emergencies involving citi-
zens suffering from mental-health
problems. The CIT training, which
was first offered in Alachua Coun-
ty about six years ago, is a 40-hourseries of lectures, videos, field trips
and role-playing scenarios designed
to help officers understand mental-
health issues, Stevens said.
About 400 UPD officers, the
Gainesville Police Department and
the county sheriff's office have gone
to the training facility and graduated
from the program, he said.
Between two and four of the
five UPD officers who were in
Adu-Brempong's apartment when
he was shot had been through CIT
training, he said. Keith Smith, who
shot Adu-Brempong, had not un-
dergone training, he said.
Stevens is calling for an addi-
tional investigation to determine if
the officers involved in the incident

Senate hopefu I
meets students
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
In his journey to become Florida's newest senator, Con-
gressman Kendrick Meek made a pit stop in Gainesville
Wednesday night to listen to and talk with students.
Speaking to a crowd of about 30 at Santa Fe College,
Meek related stories of his own personal education ex-
periences, pointing out his mother worked for a commu-
nity college.
"I look at community colleges as places of excellence,
not places where you go when you have
nowhere else to go," he said. "Just the
fact that you're at Santa Fe means you're
going to prove a lot of people wrong."
In terms of broader issues, Meek
vowed to fight on behalf of students by
making sure they get the funds neces-
sary to finance their education.
Meek "I'm not running on behalf of the
government," he said. "I'm running on
behalf of the people who are trying to make it."
The first portion of the night was spent with a panel of
students bringing forth issues to the congressman, such
as student debt, financial aid and employment prospects
after school. He then devoted the rest of the time to lay-
ing out his platform while addressing questions from the
audience.
Although he's competing for a high government of-
fice, Meek admits that he can still use some more school-
ing.
"Let me tell you something," he said. "I'm a nerd,
too."

iPad Wi-Fi network problem on campus has easy fix
About 40 people lined up at Best Buy
By VICTORIA ISRAELS
Alligator Contributing Writer
For some of the 40 people who
waited in line at Best Buy Saturday
morning, the iPad may not have
been worth the wait. If they attend
UF, they may have a difficult time
using Apple's latest gadget.
Some UF students are havingproblems signing into the cam-
pus' wireless network, according
to UF's Network Services. While
some students can sign on easily,
others can't make it past the initial
log-in screen.
The problems experienced by
some iPad users appear to be relat-
ed to the AutoFill feature in Safari.

500 try vegan pizza,
ice cream at VegFest
me-11 n. ncyb mirgatuff atl
Students line up for a free vegan lunch that was eaten faster than it could be prepared by the Animal
Activists of Alachua on the Plaza of the Americas Wednesday afternoon.* ABOUT 900 ATTENDED
THE EVENT LAST YEAR.
By ASHLEY HEMMY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Cheese-free pizza and soy ice
cream awaited about 500 students on
the Plaza of the Americas Wednes-
day during VegFest.
The event, which was sponsored
by the UF chapter of Animal Ac-
tivists of Alachua County, offered
free vegan food to students and in-
formed them about local restaurants
that offer vegan options.
"Many are happy to eat free
food," said Alyssa Cohen, the presi-
dent of the UF chapter of Animal
Activists of Alachua County. "Many
seem interested in the vegan life-
style and considered it, but never
researched it."
Last year's event had a turnout of
about 900 people and included more
sponsors, but this year the chapter
had trouble getting restaurant spon-sors because budgets were tight.
Restaurant donors this year in-
cluded Leonardo's Pizza, Gyro Plus
and Karma Cream, Cohen said.
Besides organizing VegFest, the
UF chapter of Animal Activists of
Alachua County also sends volun-
teers to animal shelters and holds
rallies in support of animal rights.
"We want to show people that
vegan food tastes good and that
it's easy to get in
On Gainesville," said trea-Campus surer and junior Anan-
dani Maharaj
Maharaj said all kinds of students
stop by for free food, and some have
never tried vegan food before.
Material science and engineering
graduate student Krishna Nittala
said he was a vegan but switched
back to meat recently because it was
hard for him to get the right nutri-
tion.
"The main concern for most veg-
ans is that they can't eat out," he said.
"VegFest gives a list of local restau-
rants that offer vegan options."

tions. "Therefore, my shirt design

Professor calls for investigation to determine if officers violated CIT training
CRISIS, from page 1
violated what they learned in the CIT course.
"The implementation of what the officers
learned in CIT training broke down," he said.
"I don't know what happened."
Before the standoff and arrest, other break-
downs prevented Adu-Brempong from get-
ting the mental care he needed, he said.
"There were several times on [the day be-
fore and the day of the shooting] that the Baker
Act should have been employed," he said.
The Baker Act involves withdrawing
someone's constitutional rights. Universities
and cities merge crime prevention and mental
health care differently, he said.In 1988, the first-ever crisis intervention
team was created by the Memphis Police De-
partment after officers shot and killed a man
suffering from hallucinations, Stevens said.
Since then, universities and cities across
America have adopted their own systems for
merging mental health care with police af-
fairs. After the shooting at Virginia Tech when
Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people before taking
his own life, the university tried to strengthen
its ability to respond to students in distress.
One measure was the creation of the Threat
Assessment Team, a collaboration between
several university departments and UPD.
According to the university's Web site, the
team determines if individuals pose threats
to themselves or others and intervenes whennecessary to maintain campus safety.
The creation of the multidisciplinary team
led to more dialogue between the counseling
department and UPD. Christopher Flynn, psy-
chologist and counselor for the Cook Counsel-
ing Center, said he meets with the Threat As-
sessment Team regularly.
"We talk .two to three times a week,
about any students that may be ofSpecial concern," he said.Report But Eugene Zdziarski, the
vice president of student affairs
at Roanoke College in Virginia, said students
also play an important role in helping students
with mental problems.
Zdziarski, former dean of students at UF,
has written several books and papers on cam-pus safety. He said many people feel reporting
on troubled students will get them in trouble.
"Everybody on campus needs to take on
responsibility to intervene," he said. "They're
not getting them into trouble. They're getting
them out of trouble."
Yearwood, who is now teaching Adu-
Brempong's class, did not think the e-mails he
received from Adu-Brempong, who suffered
from polio, were a big deal.
UF has historically done a good job of help-
ing students suffering from mental health
problems, but the UF administration should
do everything it can to makes sure the issues
can be discussed openly, he said.
"You're never going to stop every situation
from happening," he said.

Editorial
No Question
There is such a thing as
a stupid questionGoing against the tradition of bringing in intellectu-
al "heavy hitters" such as Meghan McCain, Andy
Samberg and the ever-esteemed, generic "Real
World" cast member, our beloved high council of white
sepulchres at Accent were able to lure religion experts
Dinesh D'Souza and Christopher Hitchens to campus
Tuesday night.
When it came time for the Q-and-A session, we nev-
er prayed harder for emergency phone calls as the two
speakers were subjected to a machine-gun barrage of mo-
ronic statements and questions that went way beyond the
infantile.
Such million-dollar winners include asking an atheist
to look inside himself, advising the participants to brush
up on their medieval Italian history before their next stop
at Notre Dame (I'm sure the two immediately went to Li-
brary West and poured over dusty textbooks of the Med-
ici family out of fear of being exposed as charlatans) and
the wailing of an ever-expected ad hominem ass-clown,
whose Oscar-winning performance as a real-life "Simple
Jack" might have slowed the process of human evolution
by a few millennia.
However, the best was saved for last. We respect the
young woman for trying to approach Hitchens, who can
be very daunting with his scathing sarcasm, by asking
him to take her seriously as a Christian. However, when
you immediately follow up this request by completely
butchering his last name -"Hitchenson" -you become
the personification of an epic fail.
We understand that with every public forum, you're
going to have a few turds that float to the top of the punc
bowl, but when it gets so bad that the moderator of the
debate, who is said to be nothing but a well-mannered,
class act of a professor, tells the audience they can do bet-
ter, public beatings need to ensue.
Hell, even the two opposing debaters, who under nor-
mal circumstances would have trouble agreeing on the
color of the sky, were able to put their intellectual differ-
ences aside for a minute as they united in calling one of
the questions "incomprehensible."
Are these failures of contraception, er, students, a true
reflection of the intellectual capacity of the UF Student
Body?
We can say without hesitation that they are most cer-
tainly not. That's why it's such a crime against human-
ity to have these people speak on our behalf. God forbid
an outsider sees a video of Tuesday's performance and
comes away with the impression that UF molds students
with reading lists composed of "Green Eggs and Ham"
and "The Puppy Who Lost His Way."
It doesn't matter if you're a heathen who likes to sac-
rifice baby sheep to the Fox News Channel or if you're
the second coming of Ned Flanders. Either way, we en-
courage students to stand side-by-side in delivering a
heavenly ordained, ecumenical trashing to this brigade of
bumbling bozos.
If we don't, expect our intellectual arteries to clog by a
robust lecture diet of Rob Schneider, the Kardashians and
any woman who gets a TV show on TLC because her iron
uterus can punch out a platoon of fetuses.

ne of the great mysteries of our time is the para-dox of state government. Every few years, each

For this and many other reasons, my unfunded po-
litical action committee is now backing the fledgling
campaign of Amendment Zero.
Here in Florida, we are not immune to the plague
of inadequacy that regularly undercuts the potential of
our state politicians. The biggest pothole on the road to
good governance in Florida is the setup where powerful
guys at the top of important committees essentially go
on tour and accept open bribes from the people they are
supposed to regulate.
This leads to a few regular patterns of behavior in
Tallahassee. Aside from open hostility toward the edu-
cational system, Florida lawmakers traditionally hold
a great deal of animus for people with disabilities and
the middle class. (To be completely fair, the education
lobbyists always buy the cheap caviar; how hard is it to
remember to get beluga?)
Florida annually spends a great deal of money to
feed and house hundreds of insatiably hungry lawmak-
ers, and what our state gets in return is often simply
a handout to the people and groups who already have
all the money and power that they will ever reasonably
need. If reason and need are no longer part of the equa-
tion in Florida politics, it is the position of Amendment
Zero that our fine state would be much better served
by dissolving the Florida Legislature and replacing itwith a handful of reality television
stars.
For instance, any combination
of Kardashians would be a better
political body for Florida than the
one we are burdened with right
Tommy Maple now. Kim, Kourtney and Khloe
letters@alligator org already know how to accept gifts
and whore themselves out for
money and exposure, so they are at least as qualified
to govern as 95 percent of the current Legislature. Add
in the mom and maybe one of the younger sisters, and
we would have a "Kongress" that cherishes real family
values. And lip gloss.
For the House of Representatives, Amendment Zero
suggests any four residents of VH1's "Sober House" (to
be chosen by Lt. Governor Tom Sizemore) and the cur-
rent winners from the latest seasons of "Celebrity Fit
Club" and "Dancing with the Stars" -a diverse and
representative group with expertise in all types of men-
tal illness. It goes without saying that all of this will
first have to pass muster with Gov. Justin Bieber, whose
education platform and awesome hair often make Char-
lie Crist cry in a dark corner of the governor's mansion
master bedroom.
Amendment Zero seeks wholesale changes to the
structure and functions of government, but Florida is
completely broke and the current alternative is quite
scary by comparison. I guess Florida law requires some
signatures or something, but the carnage in Tallahassee
right now shows any rational person why Amendment
Zero deserves at least a shot on the ballot.

UF suffers zombie-hater infection
There is a vast hoard arising at UF. It
is recognizable by the hoard's pasty, livid
complexions. You can spot them a mile off
by their awkward, stumbling, limp gaits.
However, the best way to spot one of these
bastion's life-sucking buggers is to get up
close and personal, so you can see the dead,
hopeless gaze in their eyes.
I am of course referring to the growing
number of zombie haters who have begun
to spread their infectious nature around our
fair campus.
These horrible, ghoulish creatures are
especially dangerous because, unlike their
undead counterparts, they do not shriek or
yell before an impending attack.
There is no rush of clopping footsteps to
aim your Nerf gun at. No, the only moans
you hear from this group are on Facebookstatus updates and mean-spirited editori-
als.
Luckily, many have a pre-existing im-
munity to this horrible affliction. Yes, there
is hope for all those who have a sense of hu-
mor and the ability to do something just for
the sake of having fun.
For those of you who have decided that
your college memories will consist of noth-
ing else but resume builders, social point ac-
tivities and alcohol-induced blackouts, I am
sorry to say that there may be no cure. You
are doomed.
I can only hope that those of you who
have succumbed to this horrible plight of
being incapable of doing or even under-
standing the act of something fun just for
the sake of fun, learn to keep your opinions
to yourselves.
I would ask that you at least learn toabide by a simple rule that the resistance
and the undead alike have sworn to uphold
and respect: "Don't be a dick!"

UPD's CIRT officers are unqualified
It goes without saying that students
should not have to fear the police who
are employed to protect them. Kofi Adu-
Brempong's incident is surely a moment the
University Police Department should learn
from. But the student organizations calling

moments of crisis. Without an incident to
justify its need, it may seem dangerous, but
the Student Body would be better served
to call for reform rather than totally aban-
doning a necessary component of campus
security. The university and the Student
Body must come together to call attention
to the lack of training that CIRT members
undergo.
As Minch Minchin's article in Wednes-
day's Alligator noted, the CIRT officers re-
ceive no more than rifle training. They are,
for lack of a better word, super-charged of-
ficers without further training. It's this lack
of training that leads to the incompetence
that some of your readers note. But incom-
petence is no excuse to create further flaws
in campus security.

Guest column
Judd Apatow-style underdog movies aren't one-size-fits-all
here's been a recent trend in mainstream cinema thatthrusts schlub guys into the spotlight. They're normal
everyday dudes who drink, smoke pot, look like your
neighbor and have lame jobs, if they have jobs at all.
The fad can be traced mostly to one Judd Apatow, a
writer turned director turned producer turned famous
name who gives away his credibility for free to his friends.
His movies have ranged from well-written comedies to di-
rectionless, gross-out films (and that's depending on who
you talk to). Apatow has led this trend that has continued
all the way up to the recent film "She's Out of My League."
Now, Apatow's loser-hero would be fine to watch if he
didn't remind us every time that, although men can now
be overweight and not-so-handsome, they still have to date
beautiful, sexy, skinny women.
How many times have we seen this film in the past five
years: A loser is the star, and he gets a girl who would be
way too hot for him in real life? "Knocked Up," "Superbad"
and "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" are just some of Apatow's
credits with this phenomenon. And, believe us, it didn't end
with Apatow. It's actually becoming the mainstream come-Julia Tilford dy of our generation, or so we've been
Spea king Out told. Dozens of movies have come out
with the same premise.
And the weird thing is, it seems
that it took this year's "She's Out of My League" for anyone
to say, "Hey, maybe we need to discuss exactly how unlike-
ly it would be that a guy who's a two would end up with a
woman who's a nine." The only problem here is that's only
one movie that would even admit the unlikelihood.
We know Hollywood has always been sexist, and we
understand that, back in the day, even Michelle Pfeiffer
was paired with Jack Nicholson. But this recent phenom-
enon is boggling to us because no one really seems to notice
it. Young people have been known to call "Superbad" the
"high-school movie of our generation."
Well, when we went to high school, the cheerleaders
didn't get snuggly with the guys in the A.V. club.
If the standard for attractive men in cinema is changing,
then why is the one for women standing still? Don't get us
wrong; if people want to make a movie about the average
guy or the sub-average guy, fine. Brad Pitt doesn't need tograce every screen, and the lack of him wouldn't tank ev-
ery film. But don't cast the anti-Brad with Jessica Alba. The
film we're watching is just the lame fantasy of the average
guy, not a movie about him. In our opinion, the fantasy has
been filmed so many times now, we'd rather be allowed to
see the truth. The Apatow formula attracts a small number
of people, and we're sick of being told these films are for
everyone.
We're not saying only people who look alike should be
together. We just want to see changing standards for men
reflected in changing standards for women. Enough films
with an Amazon being paired with our hero, the manager
of a Dairy Queen. Enough movies where romance blossoms
between a guy described as a "loveable loser" and a girl
called a "bombshell." Please make us a movie that fights
the idea that a guy can be anything, but a woman has to be
perfect.
Apatow said in a recent interview, "[The movies] may
be my way of saying to every girl who broke up with me,
'Why'd you do it?"' Truthfully, we don't really care.

Gainesville Fashion Week kicks
By ALLISON BANKO
and ASHLEY MOSES
avenue writers
Change clothes and go. The sexy
catwalk is all set for the fabulous-
ness of the runway models who are
about to stomp their heels into it.
It's Gainesville Fashion Week.
"We have an extended list of de-
signers showcasing their pieces-
the event has grown tremendously
since last year," said Melanie Ling,
media relations coordinator of
GFW.
The firsttwo seasons of GFW held
their runway shows at the downtown
lounge. The event's overwhelming
popularity caused the show to move
to the shows will be moving to The
Vault at 238 W University Ave. The
new, upscale lounge can hold about
800 people, said Tiffany Williams,
producer of GFW.
GFW will focus on designers and
boutiques such as Bobby K, Wolf-gang, Kenneth McCraney, Mesh
and Dahlia among others. All fash-
ionistas will have their fashion taste
buds satisfied with the wide range
of designer styles spanning from a
Colombian-based swimwear line to
athletic Game-Day apparel.
Wolfgang will kick off the week
with the first show tonight.
"It's cool that my show is the first
one people will see," said Matthew
Turner, owner of the boutique. "I
hope to start everything off with a
bang."
Turner will be showing more
than 60 looks in a collection of late
spring and early summer looks.
He will also show a preview of fall.
Turner is excited to introduce a few
new brands that his boutique has
recently acquired. The show will
include sexy dresses from brands
such as Motel and Pleasure Doing
Business.
In GFW tradition, the closing
show will headline local designerBobby K. His show will be ferocious
and scandalous, he said.
"My whole theme for this show is
glam," he said.

Although he usually sticks with a
more casual look, K said his show
was inspired by Hollywood starlets
from the '50s. He will be showing
everything from floor-length maxi
dresses to men's swimwear. The
dedicated team of GFW has been
waitingto see its masterpiece come
to life as the event has been in the
works since September of last year.

Who should open the
door, pay the bill?
By MICHAEL PERRONNE
and AMELIA HARNISH
avenue writers
He says.
Chivalry isn't dead. It just has a
right time and place. In a dating culture
where nice guys finish last and the as-
shole gets the girl, it's easy to see why
the gentleman is no longer en vogue.
But the blame for this shift does
not rest solely on the male gender. As
women have evolved away from Susie
Homemaker and toward Miss Inde-
pendent, the rules of the game have
changed.
The dating field is full of strong-
willed, sexually empowered women,
which means that it takes an equally
assertive man to woo them. This new
edition of female is similar to its prede-
cessors, only its attraction circuitry has
changed.
In our parents' time, courtship was
as simple as a statement of interest
with a little wining-and-dining, but acts
like buying drinks or dinner dates don't
carry with them the same implications
that they once did.
Nowadays, offeringto buy a random
girl a drink is a demonstration of being
sleezy. You may think you are being a
gentleman, but all you are really saying
to her is, "I don't have anything interest-
ing to say, so I bought you this with the
hope that you'd talk to me." Instead,
grow some balls and justtalk to her.
Girls, attractive ones especially,
know that they can exploit these so-
called "nice guys" to score drinks, din-
ners and gifts without ever having to
return the favor. It is not uncommon for
a girl to accept a dinner date for the sole
reason of getting a free meal.
Don't sweat over outdated proto-
cols. I'm not sayingto abandon all man-
ners and act like a jerk. Instead, when
you are holding that door open, temper
your expectations. She maythink you're
sweet, but you're probably no closer to
getting in her pants.
After a bond has been created and
mutual respect earned, the time for
chivalry begins. When you are on your
way to establishing a meaningful rela-
tionship, it is perfectly all right to go out
of your way to make her feel special.
Giving up your coat on a cold day, open-
ing her car door, walking her home are
chivalrous gestures that make her feellike a princess and make you seem like
Prince Charming.
Until then, save your money and
spare the formalities.
She says.
Let's be honest: Chivalry has been
dead for a longtime.
The dictionary defines this ridiculous
set of customs as: "the qualities ideal-
ized by knighthood, such as bravery,
courtesy, honor and gallantry toward
women." Yeah, I think that fairy tale
ended with the fall of King Arthur and
definitely by women's lib.
Yet some of these tired rules still
creep into our expectations of modern
dating, namely the practice of buying
drinks and dinners.
First, I have to admit I have accept-
ed a drink from a guy and just walked
away. I have also entertained conversa-
tion with men just to secure free bever-
ages for me and my friends, and I have
definitely gone out to dinner to eat for
free.
But this just shows how ridiculous
chivalry is in today's context. Women
are on their way to taking over. We are
perfectly capable of opening our own
doors, buying our own
drinks and dinners and
making the first move,
butsome of us still expect
the damsel-in-distress
treatment and some of
us, regrettably, abuse it.
Ladies, we just can't have it both
ways. We cannot expect that men, who
feel forced to take care of us in every
way or simply feel the need to buy us
presents in exchange for our attention,
will pay us the mutual respect we de-
serve. Atthe root of the chivalry concept
is the idea that we are somehow incom-
petent and need to be taken care of. I
think in more recent years, the demand
for chivalry has been based on some
sort of female entitlement -"I'm such
a great catch, he better be a gentleman
and pay for my dinner" -- which is just
counterproductive to equality.
But gentlemen, do not confuse chiv-
alry with good manners. Just because
it's unnecessary to throw your coat over
a puddle for me doesn't mean it isn't a
nice gesture to offer your blazer if I'm
cold.
And for the traditionalists, if you re-
ally want to buy me a drink, fine. But let
me get the next one.Absinthe 'Light' comes to U.S.
By GABRIELLE FALCONEIRI
avenue writer
She's the mistress to Vincent Van Gogh and friend
to bohemians and scenesters everywhere. Elusive,
magical and maybe even a little dangerous, the Green
Fairy-better known as Absinthe-is the stuff legends
are made of.
Absinthe, a strong alcohol infused with the herb
wormwood, is rumored to have hallucinogenic proper-
ties. Those are mostly myths, though Van Gogh did cut
off his own ear during a supposedly Absinthe-induced
stupor, according to absinthealchemist.com.
Wormwood releases a chemical called thujone,
which is the "culprit" behind the hallucinations and
can be toxic in high doses. However, the amount found
in Absinthe isn't nearly as dangerous as the up to
190-proof alcohol itself. Anybody binging on Absinthe
would get sick from alcohol poisoning way before the
thujone could hurt them.
The fascination surrounding Absinthe as a mind-
altering substance continues to hold strong.
It might be the cloudy green hue, the complicated
preparation process or simply the strength of this bev-
erage, but from "Moulin Rouge" to Johnny Depp and
even the teen classic "EuroTrip," Absinthe culture up-
holds its mystical reputation.Absinthe has been banned in the United States and
certain European countries since the early 1900s. If
you're wondering what bottle you recently saw in the
liquor store container, think of it as Absinthe Light.
Absinthe isn't banned as a drug in the United States,
but the chemical thujone is a substance controlled by
the Food and DrugAdministration, accordingto its Web
site. American Absinthe makers realized they could fil-
ter out the thujone and capitalize on Absinthe's popu-
larity.
Thujone-laced Absinthe, while harder to get, still
exists for people who desire a "real" Absinthe experi-
ence. Countries in the European Union allow Absinthe
production, though they strictly regulate thujone levels
in any commercially produced liquor.
For those of us in the U.S., companies that produce
Absinthe brewing kits, such as Green Devil Absinthe,
boast a thujone level higher than the European Absin-
thes.
Their kits include everything you need to make
and drink your own Absinthe except the alcohol, and
because they sell them as novelty products, the kits
exists in the semi-legal gray area between prohibition
and acceptance.
To take a trip with the green fairy, go to Publix Li-
quors in Butler Plaza, where two types of Absinthe are
sold.
Eating healthy not impossible
* WE'VE GOT TIPS FOR EAT- those who do not.
ING HEALTHY ON THE GO.
By LANCE FULLER
avenue writer
It's five minutes until your next
class. You have just come out of a
three-hour-blockand nowhavetorun
across campus to present a project.
Bythe way, your stomach is growling.
As a busy college student, you've
probably faced the problem of too
much to do and not enough time to
do it. When you finally get a chance
to eat, you may end up overeating
on foods that are quick and cheap
but not healthy. Here are some
quick tips on how to eat healthy in
college from UF's GatorWell and
Janis Mena, registered dietitian
and nutritionist from UF's Student
H health Care Center
1. Don't skip the most impor-
tant meal of the day
According to GatorWell's Web
site, even if you get out of bed at
the last second before class, eat
a piece of fruit or something quick
like yogurt on the way to class.
Studies consistently show that peo-
ple who eat breakfast have a sig-
nificantly higher metabolism than2. Stock up and plan ahead
When you go grocery shopping,
stock up and buy things that you
can freeze and take out as a snack.
Mena suggests planning your
meals in advance. Along with string
cheese and crackers made without
hydrogenated fats, sandwiches will
be a great mid-day snack that you
won't have to worry about when you
have multiple classes in a row, she
said.
3. Eat when you're hungry and
stop when you're satisfied, not
full
Accordingto caloriecount.about.
com, it takes the brain anywhere
from 10 to 20 minutes to realize
that the stomach is satisfied when
eating. The slower you eat, the few-
er calories and food you will take
in, thus you will feel fuller without
eating three meals worth of food.
For healthy eating, portion control
is a top priority and when you feel
satisfied, stop eating and push the
plate away from yourself, Mena
said.
4. Take advantage of the dining
centers and convenience stores
on campus
The many on-campus grocerystores like Provisions on Demand
in the Reitz Union, Beaty Market,
Graham Oasis and Little Hall Ex-
press have grab-and-go items that
are healthy and delicious such
as sushi, hummus and soy milk.
Also, the different student dining
centers have full salad bars and
fresh fruit and are always all-you-
can-eat. Although you have to set
up an account with Gator Dining
you will save more money in the
long run having a meal plan and us-
ing the dining halls instead of eat-
ing at the different on-campus res-
taurants every day, said GatorWell
intern Beth Kravitz.
5. Try healthier versions of your
favorite comfort foods and bever-
ages
Considering a cheeseburger
and fries to eat while you study?
Try leaner and healthier forms of
protein like grilled chicken and have
some veggies on the side or beans
and rice instead offries, Kravitz said.
Also, avoid sugary beverages like
regular sodas and fruit-flavored
drinks and instead drink more wa-
ter, skim or soy milk and unsweet-
ened or lightly sweetened tea.

'Glee' returns with Lady GaGa and guest stars
By MICHELLE PROFITS
avenue writer
Associated Press
Am ber Riley with President Barack Obama at the White H ouse "Glee" performance.Gleeks, the wait is over The show
that left America singing its high school
heart out is back from hibernation, and
not a moment too soon.
For those of you who have been liv-
ing under a rock, I'll forgive and forget if
you tune in when the show returns Tues-
day on Fox after a four-month hiatus.
But just because we haven't been
able sit in awe as New Directions belts
out another powerhouse ballad doesn't
mean the stars haven't been hard at
work. The cast made an appearance
at the annual White House Easter Egg
Roll invited by the first lady herself on
Monday Yesterday, the cast invaded
the set of "Oprah" for a "Glee"-centered
episode. This summer, the cast will
embark on a national tour, performing
its Broadway-infused songs to adoring
fans. And get yourself to the nearest
store to snatch a copy of this week's
Rolling Stone as cast members are fea-
tured on a 1950s-themed cover.
So what will become of our favor-
ite McKinley High kids when the show
kicks off? Although the season ended
with the thank-goodness-this-finally-
happened kiss between Will and Emma,
the songsters winning sectionals, and
Sue Sylvester getting kicked off her high
horse for sabotagingGlee club, we have
many questions left to be answered.
Can Finn ever come to his senses and
snatch up Rachel before it's too late?
Will the snappy, sneaky Sue finally seek
her revenge upon Glee club? And can
Puck halt his wandering eye and take
care of Quinn and his baby?
Aside from the obvious plot twists
and turns that we have to look for-
ward to (oh, who am I kidding? We only
care about the music), creator Ryan
Schwartz has also lined up quite the
itinerary of guest stars as Neil PatrickHarris, Idina Menzel, Molly Shannon
and the reoccurring Kristen Chenoweth
splash onto the "Glee" scene in the
coming weeks. Also new to theshow
is Jonathan Groff, most known for star-
ring in the Broadway smash "Spring
Awakening" with Lea Michele. Groff will
play Jesse St. James, a member of Glee
club's rival group, Vocal Adrenaline, as
well as an amorous contender for Ra-
chel's heart.
We can laugh at Kurt's diva prow-
ess and swoon over Puck's mohawk
all we want, but when push comes to
shove, there's really only one thing on
everyone's mind: What are they going
to sing?!
The show kicks off next week with
something a little different: an entire
episode with original music. Dubbed
"Original Song," the episode will feature
the kids writing and performing their
own pieces of music. Skeptics, hold your
horses and don't turn away quite yet be-
cause after this innovative episode airs,
we will be on to the.wait for it.entirely
Madonna-themed episode. The set list
features hits like "Vogue" and "Like a
Virgin." Bonus? The album, titled "The
Music, the Power of Madonna" is al-
ready available for pre-order on iTunes.
Other songs on tap for this season?
Promos feature Lea Michele belting out
"Like a Prayer" (also from the Madonna
episode) and the cast version of "Hello
Goodbye." But what got most fans in a
bedazzled tizzy was the announcement
that "Glee" would take on Lady GaGa's
"Bad Romance" and "Poker Face." Cue
the gleegasms.
So there you have it, gleeks. New
songs, new drama, new romance and
new Sue Sylvester zingers are headed
our way. It's pretty clear that "Glee" is
well on its way to taking over the world.
We wouldn't want it any other way. For
more on "Glee," visit Fox.com/glee.sexooV

Burton deserves
credit for '10 class
* THE QUARTERBACK
HELPED KEEP THE GATORS'
RECRUITS TOGETHER.
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligator org
Many wondered how Florida
was able to sign the nation's best
recruiting class this year amid un-
certainty surrounding coach Urban
Meyer's career, but it wasn't just the
staff that was working to keep the
class together.
Freshman quarterback Trey Bur-
ton, who was the second UF com-
mit for the 2010 class, was quick
to make sure no one was jumping
ship.
"I had to make sure I knew
what was going on first, then I
didn't want to lose the class, obvi-
ously, so I called (Ronald) Powell, I
called (Josh) Shaw, I called as many
people as I could and told them to
spread the word that coach is fine,"Burton said.
Powell, the nation's top pros-
pect, and Shaw signed with UF, and
the commitments of the top recruits
really started pouring in after Mey-
er chose to take a leave of absence
rather than resign.
The process the unit went
through while waiting for final de-
cisions about Meyer and the rest of
the coaching staff, which needed to
fill four vacancies, only brought the
group closer together.
"Coach talks about family, and
that's pretty much what we're
like," Burton said. "Every time one
of them comes done that is not here
already, we always hang out with
them."
Burton committed to UF before
his junior season and came to al-
most every Gators game since, but
despite the long wait, his transi-
tion to college-level football has not
been easy.
The three-star recruit struggled
early during spring practice and

UF MEN'S BASKETBALL
Tyus considers going pro
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
A year after testing the transfer wa-
ters, Alex Tyus is evaluating his NBA
Draft options.
Tyus, the 6-foot-8 power forward
who announced and reversed his deci-
sion to transfer last offseason, told the
Gainesville Sun on Wednesday that he
will submit his name into the NBA Draft
but will not hire an agent.
UF spokesman Fred Demarest said
Tyus has not filed the draft paperwork
yet, but he likely will in the near future.
"Mainly, I just want to see where I
stand," Tyus told the Sun on Wednesday.
"I want to go through the process, getting
a chance to meet some teams, working
out against other players, trying to get
better."
As a junior, Tyus averaged 11.8 points
and tied for a team-high 6.9 rebounds
per game, shooting 50.3 percent from
the field and 68.3 percent from the free-
throw line.
ESPN's Chad Ford currently doesn't
have Tyus rated as a 2010 NBA Draftprospect. The only two UF players Ford
has listed are freshman guard Kenny
Boynton (No. 101) and redshirt junior
center Vernon Macklin (No. 208).
He is the third Florida player to en-
ter his name into the NBA Draft without
hiring an agent. The other two, Mar-
reese Speights and Nick Calathes, left
the Gators for pro careers after their
sophomore seasons,
though Calathes opted
for Greece instead of the-NBA.
Tyus can start work-
ing out for NBA teams
on April 25, but he can't
miss class during work-
Tyus outs and must decide
whether he'll return
to school by May 8. He told the Sun he
won't leave early unless he's projected as
a first-round pick.
The Sun's report that Tyus will test
the draft waters runs contrary to what UF
coach Billy Donovan said Wednesday af-
ternoon. He indicated that Ray Shipman
would be the only player to leave the pro-
gram this offseason and said he expected
SEE HOOPS, PAGE 18I'm rooting for Tiger despite faults
'm going to let you in on a little se-
cret.
It's not something I'm sure I'm
proud of, but I can't deny the truth.
I'm rooting for Tiger Woods to win
the Masters this weekend.
I obviously don't condone any of
his off-the-course behavior. I don't ap-
preciate the "new Tiger," which seems
almost worse to me. At least before, I
didn't really know much about Tiger,
because he rarely let any outsiders in.
While I may have stupidly believed
that old sculpted image, that was pretty
much on my shoulders.
Now Tiger is pretending to let every-
one in but faking it. Doesn't that make
him less real in a way?
Regardless, I know I probably
shouldn't want Tiger to succeed this
weekend. My mom, and many other
women, would probably not approve.
It's a lot like rooting for the villain or
betting the Don't Pass line on the craps
table.
The only way I rationalize it to my-self is that I want
to see greatness.
And to me, Ti-
ger winning the
Masters after this
kind of layoff
Phil Kegler would be one of
Phil On the Hill the most remark-
pkegler@alligator org able sports feats
I've seen in my
lifetime. A victo-
ry at Augusta after a five-month break
would rank right up there with his U.S.
Open win on a bad ACL.
I know Tiger usually doesn't play as
many tournaments as other players and
often times even sits out the events pre-
ceding majors.
But this layoff is five months away
without a competitive tournament. Five
months filled with tabloids and treat-
ment.
Winning this weekend would effec-
tively be Tiger flipping a middle finger

Marsh's hip surgery recovery ahead of schedule
FOOTBALL, from page 17
was criticized for his awkward throwing motion.
But he showed a vast improvement in Saturday's
scrimmage, looking like more than just a threat to run.
Despite playing better and seeing improvements in
his throwing motion, he still has a long way to go in
quarterbacks coach Scot Loeffler's eyes.
"It's improved. Is it there yet? No," Loeffler said.
"It's not where we want it, but we are making some
strides."MARSH SHOULD BE READY FOR FALL: Defensive tackle
Lawrence Marsh has been out this
spring after having surgery on both
hips to repair issues with his mus-
cles and tendons.
Defensive line coach Dan McCar-
ney said trainers told him Marsh's
recovery is ahead of schedule and he
Marsh a should be ready by Aug. 1.
The redshirt senior played nine
games last season, but he was the starter at nose tackle
in 13 games in 2008.
Tyus news contradicts Donovan's statement

Chandler Parsons as a part of the
Gators' all-senior frontcourt.
"I don't anticipate anyone be-

to the world of golf. What more impressive statement could
he possibly make? He'd be showing everyone that the sport
still revolves around him and that the rules of mortal men
simply don't apply.
Also, it's important to point out that Tiger didn't really
wrong me. We're not related. I've never met him. The fact
that he's a jerk and cheated on his wife doesn't exactly make
him much different than a lot of other great, once-in-a-life-
time athletes. The hatred you might have of Woods -do
you despise other greats like Michael Jordan and Magic
Johnson? Rumor has it those two weren't exactly the most
committed men. These things simply weren't as big a deal
because the TMZs of the world didn't exist.
I know part of the problem with Tiger was that we all
felt like he was different. We thought he was going to be
that great sports star that was also a great role model. So ev-
erybody felt burned when his transgressions were revealed.
The fact that he was put on a pedestal isn't Tiger's fault.
But this isn't any sort of apology for Woods. He made
his choices because he lives in a different world than you
and I. He felt like rules don't apply to him, and the truth is
they still do not. Maybe he'll change and become some great
person of character.
The truth is I don't really care. All I want from Tiger is for
him to be putting on another green jacket come Sunday.

A Contracted General Agency For:Making Their

ompeting for a national
title on the field it uses for
practice is a dream scenario
for any team, but for the UF Paint-
ball Club, that scenario involves a
trip to Lakeland.
Every Sunday, the team drives
two hours down 1-75 to practice at
Central Florida Paintball, and this
weekend it'll make the same trek
to compete in the National Col-
legiate Paintball Association Na-
tional Championships.
"It's the best field around for
tournament paintball," UF Paint-
ball Club President Thomas Irby
said. "The area (Gainesville) fields
don't have bunker layouts."
That statement alone makes it
clear that there's a difference be-
tween this kind of paintball and
what most people enjoy recre-
ationally.
There's intricate strategy and
major time and financial commit-
ments from those involved, and
all that will come to a head this
weekend.
" P e o p l e
hear 'paint-
ball tourna-
ment, and
t h e y ' 11
say, 'Oh'
y o u ' r e
going togo hide out in the woods?"' said
sophomore Whittaker Bullard, the
club's vice president.
There's more of a strategy to
tournament paintball than duck-
ing behind trees.
Each of the five players has a
designated role. There are two
distinct sides of bunker layouts,
called dorito (left) and snake(right), with a front and back play-
er on each.
The fifth member is the "home
row" player who fires shots at the
other side of the field to dictate
where the other team will run.
Irby said a front player will
typically fire 300-to-400 rounds
per game while the back play-
ers fire between 1,000 and 1,200rou

The UF team typically
competes in AA, which con-
sists of eight to 10 games of five-
on-five for one point each, but by
virtue of a second-place finish at
a fall tournament, it will also take
on Class-A competition.
Class A is more popular in the
Midwest and Northeast, where
teams play as many five-on-five
games as possible in 32 minutes.
Irby said a Class-A league in
the Southeast may be in the works.
That would likely make a dent in
the players' wallets.

eight-to-10 cases of paintballs
