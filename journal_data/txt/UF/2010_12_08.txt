Joy Minchin had planned to 
spend her senior year getting in-
volved in more student groups.
The history and political science 
double major has taken at least 15 
credits each semester she’s been at 
UF in order to make that happen.
“I felt like I’ve just been stick-
ing my nose in a book so far,” she said.
She’s on the UF Speech and De-
bate Team, and she wanted to trav-el with the team more next fall. 
She wanted to join some politi-
cal groups. She wanted to look for volunteering opportunities.
Now, she feels compelled to 
get the most for her dollar. With the possibility of block tuition be-ing implemented next fall, she said she would have to play into the system.
“I feel like if I have to pay for 15 
credits, I will take them,” she said. “That will keep me from getting more involved.”
Minchin was one of 50 students 
who, throughout Tuesday after -
noon, protested block tuition on 
Turlington Pla-
za.
The protest 
was organized by 
one of her class -
es, called “Social Problems,” that u n a n i m o u s l y 
agreed to take action against the proposed policy.
“I know this isn’t a democracy, 
but our voices should be heard,” Minchin said.

At Tim and Terry’s music was free, a sandwich and beer 
were under $5 and college students and Gainesville locals alike 
came to let loose.
But after 13 years as a haven for Gainesville musicians and 
music lovers, the bar and music store one block north of Uni-
versity Avenue shut its doors at the end of November.
“I feel we’ve made a big difference in the music scene,” said 
co-owner Stephanie Parks. She and her husband, Terry , owned the business but had to close it due to an illness that left Stepha-nie with too little time to run it in the ailing economy.

hue, Tim and Terry’s Music & More was originally opened in Bar shuts doors

A plan to build a 100-megawatt 
biomass power plant in Gainesville 
was endorsed by Gov. Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet on Tuesday.
The endorsement means that 
only a few steps are left until con-struction can begin, including get-ting an air permit from the Florida Department of Environmental Pro-
tection.
There has been debate between 
officials and citizens about what 
the effects of the proposed plant will have on Gainesville’s environ-ment.
Those who oppose the plant, 
which will burn wood waste, say it will cause pollution and cost more money to operate, in turn raising customers’ bills.
Those who support the plant 
say it will help the 
economy by creat-
ing jobs and decrease pollution.
The cost of the plant is estimat-
ed to be $2 million. The plant will hire 44 people for operation and is anticipated to create 700 jobs indi-rectly, such as truck drivers who will be needed to get wood to the 
plant.The endorsement came after 
Robert E. Meale, a state federal 
judge, recommended that Crist and the Cabinet endorse the plant. He issued a 72-page order in No-vember that said the plant would boost Gainesville’s economy and decrease pollution.
The plant would create energy 
by burning waste wood, which are 
parts of trees that can’t be used to 
make products and are usually left to decompose after timbering op-erations.
The plant, called the Gainesville 
Renewable Energy Center, is planned to be 8 miles northwest of 
downtown Gainesville. Construc-
tion is hoped to begin early 2011 and completed in 2013. Cabinet endorses biomass plant

Students who attend a play in the Flori-
da Gym tonight will feel like they’re in Italy 
for three acts. 
An Italian civilization class has been 
working on a play to be produced and per -
formed in Italian. The performance will be-gin at 7:30 p.m. in Florida Gym Room 270.
The 17 students have been preparing for 
the production all semester.
The play, “Six Characters in Search of an 
Author,” by Luigi Pirandello, is a three-act play that has been completely translated into Italian by the students in the class.
Gianfranco Balestriere, an Italian senior 
lecturer, had the goal of a final performance for his course this semester. He said he wanted to show that the Italian language is alive on campus. 
The play breaks the wall between the 
actors and audience, partially taking place among the audience. 
“[It’s the] first time that a project like this 
becomes reality,” Balestriere said.
It is also the first time a non-theater class 
has performed a play from beginning to end in a foreign language.
Four teams have made the production 
possible, along with six students who are the major actors.
Courtney Owens, a member of the publicity committee for the play, said they 
made T-shirts with a logo of Pirandello on 
the front and a famous quote from the play on the back. Posters, fliers and playbills will be used for promotion.
“It’s a three-credit-hour class and we’re 
working it like it’s 10 or 15 credits,” he said.
The class has eaten Italian dinners as a 
group and gone out together because, as 
Owens said, you can’t act with strangers. 
Vicky Riquelme is one of the students 
who wanted to be immersed in Italian. 
Riquelme, a part of the translation team, 
said the group of eight divided the play 
among the members. 
By splitting up the three acts, each stu-
dent had about three pages overall to trans-late.
 The team created English subtitles for 
the audience to follow along while the play is being performed.
Every member of the class will be acting 
in the play . Riquelme, who has a small role, is looking forward to the performance. 
“I’ve never done theater,” she said, “but 
what I’ve noticed is being on stage is so electrifying.”4, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2010
n THEY DISCOVERED A GENE 
LINKED TO AGED LIVER FUNCTION.
By DANIELA ABRATT
Alligator Contributing Writer
After a yearlong study, researchers 
have found that the production of an im-
portant genetic protein linked to liver func-tion decreases with aging. 
If scientists can manipulate the genes to 
increase the protein level, they can make livers donated by older people more us-able in surgery . 
This could greatly shorten the waiting 
list for liver transplants, said Jae-Sung Kim, the lead researcher and an assistant profes-sor in the Department of Surgery at UF.
He and his team of six faculty members 
worked on two models for the study . They first isolated and examined individual liver cells and later studied the liver as a whole. 
In both cases, they found low levels of a 
protein called ATG4B that helps with cer -
tain liver functions.
Kim said that gene therapy is the only 
way to model a protein. Since there is no current drug available to treat aging livers, scientists need to create one that simulates gene therapy.
He said an increase in this protein will 
improve general liver function for older 
people with and without liver disease. More important, however, is its effect on 
the transplant waiting list.
According to Roniel Cabrera, a hepatol-
ogist and assistant professor at the UF Col-lege of Medicine, liver disease affects about 2 percent of the United States’ population. 
There are more than 16,000 people on 
the waiting list in the U.S. Only 6,000 to 7,000 people actually receive a new liver, 
and 2,000 to 3,000 people die from never 
receiving one, he said.
He said patients are placed on the wait-
ing list based on a calculation called the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease. This assesses the degree of various symptoms 
and function losses and ul-timately determines the risk of a patient dying in three months without a transplant. 
Cabrera said that many transplant cen-
ters are modifying their criteria for usable 
livers because organs are in short supply . 
However, this creates the potential for giv-ing the patient a liver with a number of ad-ditional problems, such as fatty tissues and high-risk genetics. 
He said this study has provided great 
insight into a mysterious obstacle, which provides knowledge that can be used to design a treatment. 
“The finding is something that could 
potentially help increase our pool of do-nors,” he said. “Now it just has to be ap-plied clinically.”Researchers make liver

78 TOTAL VOTES46% YES54% NOTuesday’s question: Do you think your fellow Gainesvillians are intelligent?Today’s question: Are you excited for Winter Break?Bush’s openness helped popularity
According to a Gallup poll released Monday, 43 
is now higher than 44. That is, former President George W. Bush is now more popular than cur -
rent President Barack Obama with a 47 percent approv-al to 46 percent approval, respectively. 
Republicans are rejoicing, but in the words of Col-
lege GameDay’s Lee Corso, “Not so fast, my friend!”
Both Bush and Obama are in the middle of their own 
respective polling trends. 
Obama and the Democrats just suffered midterm 
losses, which, although they weren’t as bad as they could have been, still serve as crippling constraints to 
business as usual on Capitol Hill. 
It would be absurd for such a Republican victory to 
occur in the midterms in November and Obama to have 
an approval rating of more than 50 percent. Any ap-
proval rating until the new Congress takes the oath and 
begins to serve is superfluous and meaningless.
Bush, on the other hand, two years removed from 
the most powerful (and stressful) position in the world, seems as likeable as your grandfather. 
There’s no doubt the former president seems much 
more willing to talk recently. 
That’s most likely because the one-year sphere of in-
fluence on the Obama administration, be it positively 
for Obama and negatively for himself and the Republi-
cans with a reminder of Bush-era turmoil, or conversely with a quip that would negatively affect the public’s perception of the Obama administration and Congres-sional Democrats.
And others are beginning to speak more freely about 
their former boss.
Richard Clarke, special adviser to the president on cybersecurity, was the first Bush-era official to speak out against his boss’s foreign policy, and that was 
while Bush still held office! 
After Obama was elected and 
before his first year was over, for -
mer Vice President Dick Cheney put in his two cents, and again 
Bush was uncharacteristically si-
lent during this process.
So after keeping quiet for nearly two years, why is 
our former president becoming such an open book? 
Two words: Book tour. 
With the release of his memoir “Decision Points,” the 
media became a literal moneymaker for Dubya. After 
all, the media were often more trouble for the former 
president than he had bargained, and I wouldn’t be sur -
prised if they had to promise to keep their shoes on to 
do the interview.
All things considered, he’s doing something right. 
“Decision Points” is, at the time of this writing, the No. 
1 best-selling hardcover nonfiction book on the New 
York Times bestseller list. 
It’s currently the No. 7 best-selling book in the Kindle 
Store and the top-selling book in its hardcover edition 
on Amazon. 
It’s even got me, a guy who identifies as left-of-cen-
ter, wanting to read it. 
Frankly, if I take “approval rating” at its original def-
inition — approval of an official’s job performance —  I think I’d concur that Bushie’s doing a heckuva job.

is why we never want to leave our protective safe zone that is 
Gainesville. But to the many who will be leaving this enchant-
ed swamp of sorts where the temperature dips 60 degrees in the span of six days, we wish you well in “the real world.” And with one final hurrah, we’d like to send you new and graduating Gators off with one final Doesn’t-It-Seem-Like-Y2K-And-Talking-About-Building-Bomb-Shelters-Was-Just-
Yesterday edition of...
Darts & Laurels
We’ll be doing things a bit differently today, so stay with 
us for our only-happens-once-a-year semester in review. These past three and a half months provide us with no short-
age of discussions. 
As if coming from the depths of Hell themselves, it seemed 
like we couldn’t get bedbugs out of our news, our beds and our minds this semester.
OK, technically the infestation began during the summer, 
but these pesky, really-do-exist bloodsuckers shut down Ab-
ercrombie flagship stores, and they plagued our newspapers 
with seemingly endless stories about the apparent surge of 
these critters.
So, for sending us into a tizzy of worry and making us 
question our safety from parasites while sleeping, we’re 
throwing a Pesticide-Laden-Stay-Out-Of-Our-Beds-You-
Filthy-Animals DART at bedbugs  worldwide. 
Speaking of things that need pesticide, our midterm elec-
tions this semester also didn’t go so well. 
We elected a governor who had no prior government ex-
perience and whose biggest claim to fame was massive fraud. 
Florida, again, took the national spotlight when, along with Kentucky, it elected a Tea Party senator. 
It seems none of us knew what we were doing when we 
went to the ballots this November. So, in light of it, we’re throwing a reflective, Please-Just-Let-Us-Make-It-Out-Of-
These-Next-Four-Years-Alive DART at our fellow Florid-
ians who voted to elect a fraud for governor.
And while some might call our current governor a fraud 
to the Republican party for his unsuccessful political party 
switch, Charlie Crist made an indelible impact with many 
Floridians this semester. 
Ending its one-of-a-kind outright ban on gay couples 
adopting children in Florida, Gov. Crist closed the door on one of the most deleterious examples of governmental big-
otry and forever wiped away the mess that put such a stain 
on Florida. For realizing there really is no one definition of 
what makes a family, and for upholding true familial val-
ues in Florida by acknowledging families come in all sorts of 
shapes, we’re gleefully giving a Look-How-Happy-You’ve-Made-The-Thousands-Of-Children-Awaiting-Homes-In-
Florida LAUREL to Crist. 
But our tanned governor wasn’t the only one to spread joy 
around the world. Our very own Pope Benedict XVI gave the 
world something to cheer for when he gave the blessing to use condoms in certain circumstances, mainly to prevent the 
spread of HIV when having sex with male prostitutes. For 
recognizing a vast majority of Vatican principles are archaic 
and looking to adapt them to modern interpretations, we’re 
sending a We’re-Just-Glad-We’re-Still-Not-Stoning-Women-
Or-Anything-Else-It-Says-In-The-Old-Testament LAUREL  
all the way to the Vatican. 
It’s been an interesting year, Gators. But, thankfully, we’ve 
always had our football team to rely on to keep you going 
through the wreckage. Oh, wait.

Stop pretending. Stop it right now. If there’s one thing 
you can do for yourself and others this coming new year, I need you to stop pretending. 
I don’t mean “pretend” like pretending to play house or 
school when you were five years old with nothing but your 
Beanie Baby collection. I’m speaking about an issue a little 
more deep: the countless lies that have been instilled in our society to which we have all fallen victim.  We have built our 
society on a foundation of superficialities and a hierarchy of 
what is right or acceptable.
Unfortunately, the majority of us have helped to socially 
construct this norm by either adding to it or quietly consent-ing ourselves to a lifelong battle with trying to do what is right. 
Does going to the gym five days a week to get that per -
fect body make you happy? Does being the skinniest girl in the room really make you better? Do the letters on your shirt equal some outstanding moral code that will promise you lifelong happiness? Although we don’t ask ourselves these questions every day, the majority of UF students and people everywhere live their lives as if the answer to these questions is indeed “yes.”  
I did it too.  
It wasn’t my fault, and it’s not your fault either. But we can 
all do something about it. 
As the end of the year approaches, I walk through the UF 
campus with a renewed perspective. I’ve woken up to the re-
ality of what’s really going on in the minds of most of my peers and, quite frankly, most people everywhere. We are all trapped in one giant game of pretend. 
What’s the danger in pretending? Why is this the best 
change you can make in the new year? Speaking from experi-ence, pretending almost nearly took my life. A year ago I was 
about 40 pounds thinner and fighting anorexia nervosa. I was 
convinced being thinner would make me happy. I thought sporting gym clothes, running that 
extra mile and sweating myself to torture made my day. I thought being society’s stereotypically thin 
female would bring me everything I was missing. 
Now a hospital visit, a year of therapy and several doctor 
appointments later, I realize just how far I took my game of pretend. 
I was so unhappy my freshman year. I was failing my 
classes. I had moved away from my high school friends. I was 
dating all the wrong guys in all the wrong places. So, I did 
what  many girls would have done. I played the blame game right away on my body. 
My body was not right in my mind, and changing it was 
going to be the solution to my problem. I put on my running 
shoes and gym shorts, threw away any bad food in my dorm 
room, bought a diet book and started to join the many girls at the gym, begging for acceptance through the manipulation of my body.  As the pounds came off I was convinced it was making me happy. 
I felt more accomplished with every dropped pound. I 
loved the comments that came along with it. “You’ve lost so much weight!” “You look great!” 
I remember to this day every single compliment. I became 
obsessed with maintaining this new weight, and the fear of 
gaining even a single pound slowly kept me more and more 
isolated from the things that really brought me joy in life. 
None of it was my fault. And none of it is your fault either. 
I didn’t plan for this to happen. I couldn’t undo everything in my life that led me to this final breaking point. I couldn’t escape the game and the rules society had given me. We find comfort in these rules, as they’re a way to measure ourselves against the world and identify with one another. But I’m done 
playing pretend. I hope all of you are, too.
I’m done hearing about the latest diet fad or listening to people talk about how many crunches they need to do be-
cause of the cookie they had with lunch. What does it all re-ally matter? If someone is so quick to judge me based solely on my appearance, I don’t want anything to do with them anyway. I’m done consenting. I am my own person.  
I’ve started listening to myself for the first time in my life, 
and it’s amazing. 
This is truly the best New Year’s resolution any of you can 
make. 
Our society has made it feel like an obligation to diet, to be 
perfect. It’s been made the norm. 
I’m now able to love my body and give it what it needs. 
I’m now able to just run on a day when my mind needs it or because my body feels like sweating and breathing. I’m now able to eat a giant bowl of ice cream with my boyfriend and 
wipe clean the mess he makes on his face. I’m now able to not 
obsess over every single calorie.
I am perfect the way I am, and so are you. I hope those of 
you struggling with an eating disorder can realize this and strive to recognize how beautiful you are for your New Year’s resolution. Everyone is beautiful in their own way.  
I had some anxiety about sharing my story, as not every-
one in my life is aware of what the past year has meant for me. 
However, I hope through my story others can find the cour -
age to stop pretending. Continuing to pretend we’re happy with manipulating our bodies to compare to others will only 
bring us even deeper into this lie. 
I’m not saying you have to have an eating disorder or be 
near losing your life to be a pretender, but if you’re escaping this threat you’re one of the lucky ones. 
My realization didn’t come easy, but it doesn’t have to be 
that way for everyone. We hold the power to change it, to stop the game. You hold the power to get real with yourself. 
You have the power to help yourself.

Blocking the Block
Students gather on Turlington Plaza to protest the implementation of block tuition, which 
would force students to pay a flat rate no matter how many credit hours they take.
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
By CHELSEA HULL
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Student Senate unanimously 
passed a resolution opposing the im-
plementation of block tuition during a meeting Tuesday night.
“I think we need to fight against it 
because it is essential for preserving university life as we know it,” said Senate President Ben Meyers, who represents the Unite Party.
Senate Minority Leader Kevin Kle-
ponis encouraged Senators and the students they represent to attend the Thursday and Friday Board of Trust-ees meeting where the block tuition proposal will be presented. If passed, the proposal will move on for consid -
eration by the  Board of Governors in 
February and can be instituted in fall 
of 2011 at the earliest.
Kleponis cited the actions of Flori-
da International University’s student 
government, who passed a similar 
resolution. He said that in a matter of 
days, the administration eliminated the possibility of block tuition.
In a cross-party agreement, Mey-
ers supported Kleponis in his call for attendance at the Board of Trustees 
meeting.
“Statewide, all eyes are on UF as 
to what we are going to do,” Meyers 
said.
Student Sen. Micah Lewis of the 
Unite Party also spoke in support of the resolution, stating that there is no clear correlation between block tuition and graduation rates.
“It is very obvious that the pro-
posal presented by the university will place numerous undue burdens on the students, and it is our responsibility as representatives of the students to make our voices heard,” he said.SG: No to block tuition

UF’s Ad Society has taken advantage of the booming 
applications market for iPhones, iPods, iPads and the 
iTouch by creating its own free Ad Society app. 
Ad Society, UF’s chapter of the American Advertising 
Federation, provides its members with experience, pro-
fessional involvement and career training for a career in advertising.“We wanted a way to keep more members actively 
involved and be able to check what is going on if they weren’t near a computer,” said Doug Nelson, the internal productions director for Ad Society.
The application will allow members and 
non-members access to information about Ad Society. 
Everything from mission statements and 
the events calendar to blog posts and pictures are a touch away.“Everything is so instant these days,” said Dayana Fal-
con, who is the vice president internal for the university’s Ad Society. “And this application will allow members to opt in at their convenience without being bombarded by e-mails for important updates, and possibly landing the next job that will jump start their career in advertising.”
“We wanted to stay relevant with the numerous appli-
cations being created daily and felt that our club should 
be on the cutting edge for technology,” Nelson said.Ad Society app makes information available on the go

The last day of classes has arrived, and DJ/
producer Le Castle Vania is here from Atlanta 
to help students celebrate their freedom until finals. The show will be at 10 p.m. at the Vault. 
Known to friends as Dylan Eiland, he plays 
to crowds all over the world, and he helped build Atlanta’s dance scene from the ground up.
Anyone who’s been out downtown has like-
ly danced to his remix of the Smashing Pump-kins’ “Zero.” 
But his style can’t be defined by one genre. 
He plays hard with tracks like “Nobody gets Out Alive,” but also gets the dance floor going with disco-type tracks like his remix of Cee Lo Green’s “F--k You,” and club tracks like “Rave is King.” His variety and originality set him 
apart in a world oDJs.
“A lot of artists start trying to sound like the 
genre that they’re within because they’re try-
ing to make music that will be played by other DJs,” Eiland said. “A lot of times I feel some of them forget about fans and the people that just listen to music.”
Eiland said his favorite part of his day is 
“just getting to make something that didn’t ex-ist before,” but it’s followed closely by his pas-
sion for playing to the people.
“It’s just a blessing to be able to go out every 
week and play for a big crowd … and just join 
in celebration with all those people,” he said. “It’s cool to experience all that good energy.”
When he plays, Eiland said he doesn’t like 
to come with too much planned.
 He just gets lost in the mo-
ment and feeds off the energy , 
and he likes to get down behind 
the decks with them.
“When I’m performing it’s like, I feel like 
almost I don’t even think at all,” he said. “You just go into this zone. Like, a lot of times after I’m done, I don’t even remember very much about what happened.”
Eiland’s tracks can be heard on his Facebook 
page or his website, lecastlevania.com, and 
tickets are available online at neonliger.show-
clix.com or the door.WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2010 n ALLIGATOR, 9
Business dropped this year
May 1997 as a convenience store and 
guitar shop. Slowly it evolved into a bar where local musicians played ev-ery day of the week, for free. 
Thursdays were jazz nights, Fridays 
and Saturdays had local bands and the rest of the week was open mic nights. 
“We offered all kinds of differ -
ent music genres,” said Stephanie, who was in charge of booking all the shows. 
Music was played everywhere at 
the house, including on the porch. Musicians came together to play the 
banjo, fiddle and drums, among others 
instruments.
“It was quite fantastic,” Stephanie 
said. 
The house attracted a mixture of 
Gainesville residents and students. There was even a class taught in the backyard once.
“I have really fond memories of 
it,” said Terry, who also owns a con-venience and music store called Park’s Place, at 120 NW 39th Ave. “It was kind of a hobby for me.”
The business was even visited by 
famous musicians. A band member from Kiss and another from Motley 
Crue played music there. Gainesville 
natives Sister Hazel also made an ap-pearance, signing chairs and drum-heads
However, in the last year or so busi-
ness just dropped, Stephanie said.
The Parks still own the building, 
and don’t plan on selling it unless a big enough offer comes up. 
Tuna Colada, a local singer-song-
writer, played at Tim and Terry’s once a month and also enjoyed hanging out there.
“I’m very sad. It was a good ven-
ue,” said Colada. “Everybody who went there felt like they were a part of 
it.” 
He said he’ll remember the recep-
tive crowds, cheap beer and the porch, 
which was a “good place to sit and watch the world go by.”BAR , from page 1 Atlanta DJ to play at rave

The Board of Trustees will vote on the proposal when it meets Friday
dent who teaches the class, said 
her students opposed the idea of the university becoming a degree factory.
“They disagree with the idea 
of buying education in bulk,” she said.
UF Provost Joe Glover has been 
answering questions about block tuition for about a month now, reit-erating the fact that the policy does not force anyone to do anything — it merely gives them incentive. 
The administration has stood 
by its stance that block tuition is not a money-making measure, but a policy that will encourage more students to graduate in four years.
Glover said he respects the fact 
that some students work while tak-ing classes, but he wonders about how many need to do so.
“Do you work because you 
have to work, or because you want to work?” he said.
Glover said the added cost of 
education — tuition and living expenses — is offset by the money earned by graduating and getting a job sooner.
He also said it is not the uni-
versity’s responsibility to adjust its 
policy for specific situations where 
a student’s family cannot or will not provide the “expected parental contribution” that is estimated to factor into the cost of attendance.
He noted that 60 percent of UF 
students do not take loans of any kind.
The Student Senate unani-
mously passed a resolution oppos-ing block tuition Tuesday night. Senate President Ben Meyers, of the Unite Party, said SG does not believe block tuition will actually increase graduation rates.
“It’s going to financially burden 
students,” he said. “It’s going to hinder the student experience.”
The Board of Trustees will hold 
two days of meetings, starting Thursday, where the issue will be discussed. The board could vote to approve the policy Friday.
If approved, the proposal would 
have to clear one more hurdle in February — the Board of Gover -
nors — before it would become 
policy next fall.BLOCK , from page 1

Coach Mary Wise and the Gators will travel to Austin, Texas, to take on Purdue in the 
regional semifinals.
UF VOLLEYBALL
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
 
The Gators did not have much time to cele-
brate or recover from their emotionally drain-
ing victory against Florida State on Dec. 4.
The next day, No. 1 Florida (29-1, 20-0 
Southeastern Conference) was already at 
work preparing for its next opponent: Purdue 
(23-10, 12-8 Big Ten). 
“We woke up Sunday morning and had to 
watch the video to make sure we won,” coach Mary Wise said. “We met with the team Sun-day afternoon and then we put closure on it. We talked about what we learned, the reason for the closeness of the match in terms of how great Florida State played and some of the 
things we needed to have done better. 
But all of the talk about the FSU victory 
stopped there. From then on, UF’s focus 
shifted toward beating Purdue, Wise’s alma 
mater.
The Gators will travel to Austin, Texas, 
to face the 16th–seeded Boilermakers in the 
NCAA regional semifinals Friday at 6 p.m. 
After watching video of Purdue, Wise no-
ticed similarities with other ranked opponents the Gators have defeated this season.
“They run the 5-1 offense similar to Colo-rado State and are a great blocking team like 
Colorado State,” Wise said. “The difference is 
they are a back-row team that would be more like LSU in terms of the way they use their de-fensive substitutes and they’re just really, re-ally fast in the back row.”
If Florida wins, it will take on the winner of 
Illinois (24-8) and Texas (25-5).
Florida and Purdue will be meeting for 
only the sixth time ever. The Gators lead the 
series 3-2 with the last contest dating all the 
way back to Sept. 2, 1995.
Purdue opened its NCAA Tournament 
with a 3-1 (25-18, 24-26, 25-17, 25-18) victory against  Kentucky . The Boilermakers were also able to do something that the Gators were unable to do — defeat Penn State. Purdue took care of the Nittany Lions 3-2 (21-25, 18-25, 25-16, 25-18, 15-11) on Oct. 8.
“If you play any team that’s coming out of 
the Big Ten, in recent pasts, you’re playing a team that’s battle-tested,” Wise said. 
“This Purdue team in particular features 
the best of both — they’re big and physical in the front row and they are jet-fast and great ball-handlers in the back row. They’re going to be a real tough matchup for us and that’s the way it’s supposed to be when you get to 
this round with only 16 teams left.”Gators prep for regional semisSports

POLL RESULTS TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG UF VOLLEYBALL UF IS SHOOTING 33 PER -
CENT FROM 3-POINT RANGE 
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
After a pair of games in which 
their offense looked disorganized 
and out of sync, the Gators re-turned to form against American 
and rediscovered what it takes to 
get clean looks at the basket. 
Now all they have to do is 
start converting those opportuni-
ties into points. 
If Florida is to live up to its 
lofty preseason expectations — 
and more immediately score a victory over Kent State on Thurs-day at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell 
Center — it will have to find a 
way to improve its 3-point shoot-
ing percentage, which has been 
only mediocre so far this season. 
With Vernon Macklin emerg-
ing as a dominant scorer in the 
paint, the Gators are likely to face a number of zone defenses like they did Sunday against Ameri-can. 
Those schemes provide help 
for the opposition’s interior de-
fenders, thus forcing UF to take 
shots from the outside, some-thing it hasn’t excelled at to this point. 
“I wouldn’t say I’m concerned, 
but I do think teams maybe start doing that,” senior Chandler Par -
sons said. “We just have to con-tinue to move the ball. We’re not shooting a high percentage, but if we have a good look at the 3 
we’re obviously going to still 
take it.” Despite trying to hold for the 
best available look, the Gators 
have shot just 33 percent from 
beyond the arc this season. 
That total puts them below the 34-percent mark that is not 
only the national average, but also what opponents have shot 
against them this year. 
“Overall shooting we’ve been up and down as a team,” junior 
Erving Walker said. “Shots are going to come and go.”
The Gators have definitely had 
their highs and lows from long 
distance, shooting better than 40 
percent against Ohio State and 
North Carolina A&T before hit-
ting just 15 percent against UCF. 
This game-to-game variance is 
something coach Billy Donovan 
has come to accept from players 
like Parsons, Walker and sopho-
more Kenny Boynton, who have 
all shown the ability to be scorch-
ing hot or ice cold at any given 
moment.
“We’re going to be a team 
that’s probably going to be streaky from the 3-point line,” Donovan said. “When you look at the course of a season there’s a 
lot of ebbs and flow of shooting, 
and what you’re probably going to have to do is look at the shoot-ing percentage at the end of the year.”
Florida’s streaky shooting is 
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF guard Kenny Boynton has struggled with his outside shooting so far this season, hitting just 27 per-
cent of his 3-point shots. 
Gators look to improve shooting against Kent St.
For more than a week, I’ve tried to fig-
ure out what I wanted to accomplish with my last column in the Alligator.
What did I want to share with the read-
ers? Who did I want to thank? What lesson did I want to pass down?
For days and days I agonized over this 
and came up with literally nothing. All I had was my byline, which will be running for the last time today. 
I even forced myself to start writing just 
to see if something would come out. All that 
yielded was 842 words that I deleted after 
changing my mind multiple times. 
This is the most challenging thing I’ve 
ever had to write. 
I want to thank UF coaches Tim Walton, 
Mary Wise and Kevin O’Sullivan. You’re great coaches and were a pleasure to work with over the years.
Thanks to SIDs Zanna Ollove and Sean 
Cartell. You always went out of your way to help me do my job. 
And thanks to everyone who read any of 
my columns over the past year and a half, it 
means a lot to know people are reading and 
discussing. 
But this one time, this column is not for 
you all. 
This column is for the Alligator. For the 
people who continue to work there now. And for the people who will work there long after I’m gone. 
For three and a half years, I gave every-
thing I had to this paper, and I was lucky enough to work with people who did the same. People who be-came my best friends. Friends who became 
my brothers. 
Thank you Mike, 
Bobby, DiFer and

had together, not be-cause of where we were or what we were 
doing, but because all of you were there. 
Mike, you’re the only reason I got a job 
at the paper. You taught me how to report. And you kept me from quitting when I hon-estly considered it. 
Bobby, I spent the most time with you 
out of anyone. You are an exceptionally giv-ing friend, and we made the journey from fan to reporter together. 
DiFer, you’re everyone’s most entertain-
ing friend. I don’t know how you put up with all of us. I never remember anyone ever fighting with you or complaining about you. As much crap as we give you, don’t ever dis-
appear, man. 
Adam, you came in late, but added so 
much. Your fire and determination made 
you a perfect fit with the group. Anything you ever did at the paper, you did well. 
I left Phil out of that group, not because 
I’m better friends with him than any of the rest, but because he impacted my alligator -

You helped me so much with my writing The Hawk’s wisdom hits home for soon-to-be-departed columnist

TAMPA — Derek Jeter can admit 
it now: He was definitely getting 
steamed at the New York Yankees.
While Jeter tried to keep talks 
quiet as the sides negotiated, the 
Yankees went public with sugges-
tions his increasing age and de-
creased numbers should result in a pay cut.
At one point, Yankees general 
manager Brian Cashman said the 
36-year-old shortstop should ex-
plore other options.
“I was pretty angry about it, and 
I let that be known,” Jeter said Tues-
day after finalizing a $51 million, 
three-year contract that cut his sal-ary. 
“I was angry about it because I 
was the one that said I didn’t want 
to do it. I said I was the one that 
wasn’t going to do it.”
At a news conference at the team’s spring training home to announce the agreement, Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner 
and Cashman maintained there will 
be no lingering fallout.
“A big happy family,” Jeter said. 
“You move past it. It’s over with, and I won’t bring it up again.”
Jeter and the team reached a pre-
liminary agreement Saturday on the deal, which includes an $8 million 
player option for 2014 with a $3 mil-lion buyout that could make it worth 
$56 million over four years. With an escalator, his 2014 salary could rise to $17 million and make the contract 
worth $65 million. 
Jeter hit .270 with 10 homers this 
year, down from a .334 average and 
18 homers the previous season. 
While his RBIs increased by one 
to 67, his on-base percentage fell from .406 to .340 and his slugging average dropped from .465 to .370.
After averaging $18.9 million as 
part of a 10-year contract, he gets salaries of $15 million next year, $16 million in 2012 and $17 million in 2013, with $2 million annually de-
ferred and payable on each March 
15 over three years starting in 2015.
Jeter wouldn’t say if this will be 
his final contract. There were no dis-
cussions during contract talks about the possibility of moving Jeter to a new position.
“I want to play as long as I’m hav-
ing fun, and I’m having fun now,” Jeter said. “If I’m not enjoying myself, then I won’t be playing.”WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2010 n ALLIGATOR, 19

re-sign with the Yankees.
Jeter angry over contract negotiations
when I was raw and inexperienced. We always chal-
lenged each other’s opinion in an unreasonably con-structive and productive way. And I’m incredibly 
proud of the section we put out together last fall, when 
we made the paper our life. 
To Nick Zaccardi and Katie Sanders, I always took 
notes on the way you worked, even if you didn’t real-
ize it. You set a great example for any less experienced 
writers to follow. 
To Steph and Erica, we made your lives as hard as 
possible sometimes, but it was always in the name of a good product. Thanks for all your hard work. You 
never get the credit you deserve. 
To all future Alligator writers, editors, photogra-
phers, and multimedia and production staff: I can only 
hope you will feel the same way about your time in 
that old office as I do when you’ve finished your last 
story. 
Please, work hard, chase stories, stay late and be proud to pick up your paper every day. 
Most importantly, always understand that as long 
as your name is in that masthead, the paper is a reflec-tion of you. 
Too often excuses are made, responsibility is passed 
and accountability is lost. 
Too often I hear reporters talk about writing for a 
Hearst and editors working for a résumé. 
Your name is on that story and on that paper. And 
that should be enough to make you want to be great. 
This summer, I had the chance to cover the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cooper -
stown for MLB.com. Former Expos and Cubs legend 
Andre Dawson repeated a message throughout his 
speech that stayed with me and anyone can relate to. 
“If you love the game, the game will love you back,” 
the Hawk kept saying.
I loved working for the Alligator. Gave it all the 
love and effort I had. 
All it gave me back was a future in journalism and 
some of my very best friends.KYLE , from page 18Yankees re-signed the shortstop
Boynton’s shooting 
has been inconsistent
personified best by Boynton, who has had three games 
without a 3-pointer, five games with multiple 3-pointers and none in between. 
So far this season, Boynton shoots 30 percent from 
3-point range following a make and just 21 percent from 
distance following a miss. 
He also converts 36 percent of his 
long-range chances in halves when he made his first attempt while scoring only 12 percent of those tries in halves 
where he missed his first shot.
Boynton says his confidence is not an 
issue, but he does admit that his first attempt can be a 
predictor of things to come.
“It can go either way, and sometimes it just depends 
on the game and the shots that I take,” Boynton said. “Depending on whether I hit my first one, that’s how the half will be.”HOOPS , from page 18“I was pretty angry about

Forward Jennifer George helped Florida dominate in the paint against 
Harvard on Tuesday, scoring eight points down low in the first half.

Coach Amanda Butler challenged her team to 
respond after an upset loss to Brown last weekend 
in which the team performed poorly in all facets 
of the game.
The Gators answered in nearly every possible 
way Tuesday. 
Florida (8-2) notched season highs in points 
(86), field goal percentage (49.2), assists (19) and tied season highs in steals (11) and 3-point per -
centage (40.0) while routing Harvard (4-3) 86-65 in the O’Connell Center.
“I’m proud of the response and showing so 
much resilience in the face of a big, disappointing loss,” Butler said. “Now we just have to strive to have that same hunger, that same edge, that same feeling and that same level of confidence going 
forward.”
After missing Florida’s previous three games 
due to injury, Brittany Shine made an immedi-
ate impact in her return to the lineup.  The fresh-
man scored eight first-half points and added eight 
more in the second for a career-high 16 points on 6-of-10 shooting.  
Shine, anxious to return, came off the bench to 
lead the Gators in scoring and also added three 
assists and a steal.
“It was more painful to sit out than it was to 
have my injury,” Shine said. “I’ve been itching to 
play for the past week.”
Florida fed the low post frequently to start the 
game and was able to create easy looks inside that amounted to 18 points in the paint at half.  
Eight of those belonged to sophomore forward 
Jennifer George, who scored a season-high 14 
points and grabbed eight rebounds. The Gators led 43-27 at the break on the heels 
of a 10-2 run. The 43 points at the half were the 
Gators’ highest since putting up 45 in the season opener against DePaul on Nov. 18. 
Florida’s defense forced 15 Harvard turnovers 
in the opening 20 minutes and continued to press coming out in the second.  Lanita Bartley and Jor -
dan Jones recorded steals off inbounds plays lead-ing to easy buckets in transition and the rout was on.
Florida, keyed by its attacking defense, went 
on a 17-2 run midway through the second half, ex-tending its lead to as much as 33 points.
Butler questioned the team’s leadership after 
the Brown loss and said she applies pressure to 
her guards to set the tone for the team.  
Freshman guard Jaterra 
Bonds, making her first career 
start, rose to the challenge.
Bonds, one of four Gators to 
score in double digits, teamed 
with Bartley to run the offense with precision and tallied 11 points, three assists and a steal. 
“When I’m on the floor, I try to lead in every 
way I can, whether I’m coming off the bench, in 
the huddle or if I’m starting,” Bonds said. 
Florida carried a 20-plus point lead for much of 
the second half and the result was never in ques-tion.  
In what is becoming a trend, all 12 Gators who 
suited up found their way onto the stat sheet and 
11 scored.  Butler said she and her players take 
pride in a collective effort.
“We’re a team,” Butler said. “It was contribu-
tions from everyone. When we play unselfish …we’re a great team and we can play with anyone, 
anywhere.”UF dominates low post in win
