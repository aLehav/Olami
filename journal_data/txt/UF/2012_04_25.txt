� THE EXTENDED HOURS BEGAN SUNDAY 
AND WILL RUN THROUGH MAY 4.

All-day study fests don’t have to end with 
classes: Students can study in campus libraries 
through May 4.
Library West will remain open 24 hours a day 
until May 4, when it will close at 6 p.m.
Marston Science Library will have extended 
hours, too. 
The hours started Sunday.Marston will stay open from 8 a.m. to 4 a.m. 
until May 2. On May 3, it will stay open from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. and on May 4 it will stay open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
This is the ﬁ  rst time Library West will stay 
open 24 hours a day during ﬁ  nal exams.
In previous semesters, the library was open 
until 4 a.m. and then closed for a few hours, said Patrick Reakes, chairman of Library West.
He said it didn’t make sense to close the li-
brary when the early-morning time is busy.
“It just seemed to make sense for the stu-
dents,” he said.
Library West has had extended hours all se-
mester.
The trafﬁ  c throughout the semester has been 
consistent, Reakes said.
He said last week about 300 people were in 
the building at 2 a.m., 200 were at 3 a.m. and 125 were there at 4 a.m.
Library Spokeswoman Barbara Hood said 
she expects trafﬁ  c to increase this week.

Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill that will let UF exceed a 5 
percent limit on bonds on a student fee to the renovation 
and expansion of the Reitz Union.
The Student Activity and Service Fee is a fee students 
pay per credit hour each semester, along with tuition.
State university boards of trustees are required to estab-
lish the fee, which cannot increase by more than 5 percent each year. 
This new bill, signed Friday, grants UF an exception for 
the Reitz Union. The fee already increases by 5 percent each year, which was the maximum until Scott signed the bill.Last month, the UF Board of Trustees approved issuing 
$50 million in bonds for the expansion of the Reitz Union, pending Scott’s signature.
Reitz Union Board of Managers Chairman Sean Fahy 
said the campaign to renovate and expand started last 
year. 
He said about 5,000 students signed an 
initiative.
Former UF Sen. Jonathan Ossip said 
students voted against a new fee in Spring 2010 elections. 
“It just seems unfair to students who 
are trying to make ends meet,” he said.
He said this is essentially creating a 
new fee anyway.
The renovations and expansions are estimated to cost 
about $70 million, Fahy said.
Fahy said a team compiled of members from the Board 
of Managers and the Make it Reitz campaign will start looking at potential designs and getting student input.
“It has ﬁ  nally come to realization that it’s going to hap-
pen,” Fahy said.

While preparing for summer break, this 
week’s weather felt like winter to some stu-
dents.
Temperatures flirted with daily record 
lows Monday and Tuesday. Monday’s high temperature was 10 degrees cooler than the average 82 degrees Fahrenheit, according to The Weather Channel. Early Tuesday morn-ing, temperatures plunged to 40 degrees — about twenty degrees cooler than average.
Zaaron Allen, a National Weather Service 
meteorologist, said a cold front last week caused the change.
“We came within a degree or two of reach-
ing record lows last night in a few places in North Florida,” Allen said.
Allen said the front came in the form of a strong area of low atmospheric pressure, which results in rain or overcast skies fol-lowed by cool temperatures.
Although it is unusual to have cool tem-
peratures at the end of April, Allen said that late spring cold snaps have occurred in the past few years.
Some welcomed the lower-than-normal 
temperatures.
Hannah Wong, a 21-year-old UF business 
junior, said she was pleasantly surprised by the cool weather.
“It’s kind of nice,” she said, “because I 
know it’s going to get hot really soon.”

Gainesville residents who routinely work overtime and 
give up their weekends to put in hours at the office can give 
themselves a pat on the back.
In the latest issue of PARADE Magazine, Gainesville was 
ranked the No. 6 hardest-working city in America. Columbia, Mo., was ranked as No. 1.
Gainesville beat areas like Dallas and Los Angeles because 
its residents work more than an average of 36 hours a week and are more willing than most to give up their weekends.
“This ranking is a great indication of the work ethic among 
the citizens of Gainesville,” Mayor Craig Lowe said. “Now, companies will see that Gainesville is a good place to locate because they will have access to hard workers.”
The rankings were based on four criteria chosen by an edi-
torial team at PARADE. The four categories were average hours worked per week by city residents, residents’ willingness to work during personal time, number of homes where both parents had an income and the city’s employment rate.
Data regarding hours worked, income 
and employment rates came from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Cen-sus Bureau. A survey given to a random 
sample of Gainesville residents by Mediamark Research and Claritas provided data.Columbia, Mo., earned the No. 1 spot on the list because 
it kept unemployment rates from increasing during the worst economic downturn the area had seen since the Great Depres-sion.
The fact that Gainesville is home to a thriving university 
and nationally lauded health care programs helped its ranking, PARADE Magazine editor Maggie Murphy wrote in an email.
Because Gainesville is a research university, many of its pro-
fessors work long hours and spend a lot of time in the lab.
“People who work at the university are emotionally at-
tached to UF,” UF Spokesman Steve Orlando said. “So that means they are willing to put out extra work to really make it stand out.”

� A SENATOR ANNOUNCED 
HIS IDEA TO RENAME THE REITZ UNION. 
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Writer
Two bills that will restructure 
the executive branch of Student 
Government unanimously passed their second and final rounds of approval at Tuesday night’s Stu-dent Senate meeting.
The Agency Reorganization Act 
and the Cabinet Reorganization Act were heard the first time at last week’s meeting. Agencies are more autonomous and focus on specific programming, and cabinets deal with programs for groups of stu-dents.
The Cabinet Reorganization 
Act passed unanimously after two amendments. Sen. Daniel Landes-berg proposed adding a clause that makes each cabinet secretary responsible for submitting a status report to the Student Body presi-dent and the Senate president once a semester.
“It’s a great way to make sure people are doing their job,” Landesberg said after the meeting.
After the meeting, Sen. Carly Wilson said the amendment was a compromise. 
She said she wanted reports done once a month.
She also amended the clause 
to say that the reports are due one week after spring and fall elec tions.
The Senate also amended the 
bill to add a secretary of satellite affairs. Before the amendment, the bill proposed to have a secretary of family, graduate and satellite af-fairs.
During public debate, Sen. Ford 
Dwyer unveiled his fall initiative to change the name of the Reitz Union. The Reitz Union was named after the fifth university president, whose name was linked to an anti-gay purge at UF, Dwyer said.
Dwyer said he is proposing 
to change the name to the Virgil Hawkins Student Union. He said Hawkins, a black man, was in a decade-long court battle trying to gain admission to the Fredric G. Levin College of Law. He eventu-ally made a deal with the univer-sity and withdrew his application for the integration of UF graduate programs.
“I encourage a new name on the 
union’s new face,” Dwyer said.
The meeting also unanimously 
passed a bill honoring UF Board of Trustees Chairman Carlos Al-fonso for his 11 years of service to UF and a resolution supporting the creation of a crosswalk for Jen-nings Hall.

My father scolded me when I was in sixth grade for be-
ing too timid to try out for the school play.
“If you want to do it, do it,” he said. “I’ll be here to 
support you. When I was your age, people laughed at me when I wanted to try new things like this. I will never do that.”
And he never did. He still doesn’t.That laugh could’ve come when I told him I dreamed of be-
ing a journalist. Instead, he told me that I could do whatever I chased after.
And so I did. I’m still chasing.In January, at the start of my ﬁ  nal semester in college, I found 
myself leading my peers at the country’s largest independent student-run newspaper. It was one of the the scariest positions I had ever been in — the responsibility was overwhelming.
But given the talents of our students, I knew we would rise 
to the occasion.
The course of events since then proved challenging. From 
the tragedy on Interstate 75 to the tumultuous Student Gov-ernment election to the loss of one of our classmates last week, this staff was charged with delivering the news to you quickly, clearly and accurately.
At every turn, we did our best to deliver for you, the reader.On our sports pages, UF’s athletes routinely gave our writers 
plenty to report and opine about. They traveled far and burned the candle at both ends to give you coverage of the basketball team’s journey through the NCAA tournament.
Our opinions pages were ﬁ  lled with your voices. You were 
willing to put your thoughts out there for us. For that, we thank 
you.
On our website, our priority was to 
get you the best information fast. We posted articles and photos at all times of day. We tried to reach you through Twitter and Facebook.
And through all this, the Alligator 
became our second home. On any day, you could ﬁ  nd editors and reporters pounding on keyboards, writing and editing stories. At night, we sometimes 
didn’t have enough chairs for the number of students — both staffers and freelancers — who came to work.
I’m honored to have served as your editor. To our staff, this 
job has always been about serving you, the readers. We worked tirelessly day and night to make sure you knew why there were police cars with lights on outside your apartment window, where that smoke was coming from or what kinds of decisions your Student Government was making.
And behind every inch of space that we ﬁ  lled this semes-
ter stands the efforts of more than 50 students on a close-knit team.
As editor, I am privileged to have worked with such an 
amazing group of journalists. As a soon-to-be UF graduate, I am lucky to have found such a wonderful group of friends.
My father visited the newsroom for the ﬁ  rst time about a 
month ago. Afterward, he told me he was impressed with what we do and he was happy to meet my Alligator family.
When he asked me how hard it was to keep up the energy, 
to keep pushing to ﬁ  ll the paper with good stories every day, I stopped, thought for bit and laughed.
“Well, we just keep chasing.”
All UF students should stand up to cuts
First, they came for the Computer and Information 
Science and Engineering Department. But we must speak out, even if we are not computer scientists.
Thankfully, I’m not the only one speaking out on some-
thing causing UF to be the target of recent nationwide criticism.
Facing budget cuts, UF is planning to do some serious 
damage to the CISE department. The university plans to move all of CISE’s degree programs, most advising staff and many other faculty members to other departments.
Other CISE staff will be eliminated.The story was picked up by Steven Salzberg and pub-
lished by Forbes, which made the story a hit nationwide. Harsh criticism about the proposed changes has poured in from around the country.
Notably, professor Zvi Galil, dean of computing at 
Georgia Tech, sent a public letter to UF President Bernie Machen that said he was “amazed, shocked and angered” at the “reckless” proposal.
We’ve heard it many times over: Almost every ﬁ  eld re-
lies on computer science and information technology in some way, and for economic and technological reasons, the CISE is the last department that should have its fund-ing cut. But this budget crisis highlights a recent history of funding issues at UF.
UF administrators are facing tough budget constraints. 
During my time at UF, every year has brought some new budget challenge.
Even if the proposed CISE changes were withdrawn, 
a similar battle would have to be fought next year. This is the constant battle at UF: Budget cuts come in from the state, or we face some other funding issue that results in small cuts made in many departments.
These small cuts have huge long-term effects on the 
quality of the departments and push us away from excel-lence and toward mediocrity. In this case, it’s much more than a small cut, and it will likely make the prominent CISE department irrelevant.
All students should oppose 
the drastic changes proposed for the CISE department. We can’t accept near eliminations of entire departments because of a particularly rough ﬁ  nancial year. Instead, students and staff should demand the CISE depart-ment survive this year without 
any major restructuring. Then we have to focus on devel-oping new ways to fund UF’s many departments, at the state level and otherwise.
If you are from another department, you might wonder 
why you should care about the changes to the CISE de-partment, especially because the CISE cuts were proposed to prevent damage to other (your) departments. But won’t similar budget troubles be faced next year? And doesn’t inaction now set a precedent of tolerance for other dras-tic department cuts? And might the cuts then affect your department?
There’s no hiding the effects of budget cuts. We’ve 
dropped signiﬁ  cantly in U.S. news rankings over the past couple of years; if action isn’t taken now, we’re going to have a tough time staying on the road to academic excel-lence.
And we’re certainly going to have trouble if the gover-
nor’s ofﬁ  ce doesn’t prioritize education. Gov. Rick Scott has a nasty history with education funding, and he clearly shows little care in this matter for his constituency, be-cause Floridians care about education.
It’s our duty to ensure that those in ofﬁ  ce share our 
views on education. But in the meantime, all students should oppose drastic, rash budget cuts to the CISE de-partment. A precedent for the entire university is at stake.

There are few things less fashionable than being 
a conservative in a college town. Your profes-sors find you odd, you don’t get to go to the 
cool rallies and every once in a while you get called a bigot or a fascist without provocation. However, there is a major perk. Brace yourself — it may sur -
prise you.
A conservative on a college campus can achieve 
a serene state of being that is pursued by many but accomplished by few: the status of a contrarian. If that’s not fashionable in this post-modern, edgy soci-ety, I don’t know what is. There are a lot of faux con-trarians out there — the hipsters, for example, who claim to be paragons of individualism yet all wear the same style of jeans. If anyone can explain that to me, hit me up; it confuses me. I always thought a true individualist would drape himself or herself in vel-vet, Costanza-style.
“But wait!” you say, “I thought the liberals were 
the contrarians, with their groovy enlightenment values in opposition to the oppressive reactionary culture!” You’re 50 years too late, old chap. Anything that was once considered mainstream conservatism is long dead.
The major political parties, the news media (Fox 
News, too) and the educational system are all bent over backward swilling from the keg of progressive groupthink. I blame Reagan.
Yet simply calling yourself a conservative is not 
enough. You have to go full-hog. As I said, neither of the major political parties are conservative, these days — including the Republicans. If Edmund Burke could see modern “conservatives” spouting inter -
ventionist war propaganda like it was going out of style, he might endorse another American Revolu-tion. If you want to be a true contrarian, you have to go old school. That means paleoconservative — the hard stuff. Ditch the neoconservative baby’s milk ex-creted by Fox News and the Republican Party. It’s just the same post-Enlightenment wolf in sheep’s clothing. John Stuart Mill could cuddle with it.
If you want to find out whether someone is tru-
ly conservative, try an experiment. Ask him or her whether he or she believes in human progress. If he or she either says yes, or worse, stares at you in confusion, it’s a red flag. Conservatives don’t be-lieve in progress — it’s the best arrow in the contrar -
ian quiver. When Repub-licans say they can build democratic societies in despotic Middle Eastern 
societies, they reveal their progressive dispositions. Crack-pipe dreams of universal democratic harmo-ny are in no way dispositionally conservative.
Once you can grasp this denial of human prog-
ress and embrace a brooding pessimism, you’re in business. The rest will follow in tow. Multicultural-ism and the ever-worshiped “invisible hand” of eco-nomics will rightly appear as the futile machinations of fool-headed optimists.
One more caveat: You have to get religion. Noth-
ing can teach you more about the limits of human-ity than a romp through the Good Book. Calvinism is my bag, but it is by no means necessary. Avoid preachers who exhort politics from the pulpit, how-ever. There’s nothing worse than a clergyman who can preach humility one day and get chummy with a politician the next.
Finally , be prepared to defend yourself. The 
slings and arrows of mainstream progressives will be lobbed with gusto.
But do not despair. Luminaries such as Russell 
Kirk, Peter Hitchens and the aforementioned Ed-mund Burke have built a strong castle from which to defend yourself. If you have to vote Republican, go ahead, but you should not under any circumstances be happy about it.
Our day has not yet come. Our day will be when 
the post-Enlightenment mantra is finally proven wrong, and the hordes of citizens awaking from their slumbers say , “We should have listened to you all along.”
And then we’ll be super cool.Luke Bailey is a history junior at UF. His column ap-

ments contained any animosity or ill-will toward Florida Blue Key, I would respectfully say that is completely false. As stated in the article, I am not angry. 
Florida Blue Key is indeed the 
oldest and most prestigious orga-nization at UF. The organization has and continues to serve the uni-versity in myriad facets, uniting leaders throughout the university. 
More importantly, I have 
worked with colleagues and have had friends past and present who have been inducted to Florida Blue Key whom I have had noth-ing but respect for throughout my UF experience. 
The distinction of leadership 
cannot be created or defined by Florida Blue Key, but it can be rec-ognized and celebrated by it. 
The organization was built 
upon a legacy of leadership and service, which has been the core focus and fundamental accom-plishment in its 90 years of exis-tence. 
Even though I was not accept-
ed, I can only strive to continue to refine my leadership skills, as any leader would, both in FBK and outside it. Leaders campuswide apply to gain acceptance to the organization, and because of that, membership is extremely com-petitive.
Undoubtedly, there have been 
a multitude of prominent leaders on campus and in the nation who have been members of Florida Blue Key; simultaneously, there have been important leaders in both of these spectrums who were not members of Florida Blue Key. 
On the other hand, some of my 
colleagues and friends who made considerable contributions to cam-pus in their leadership were not offered the opportunity to serve in that capacity; it does not diminish their roles or accomplishments on this campus.
It is important to note that many 
of the current and past members have done great things for the uni-versity, and many members of the organization have earned my re-spect. I wholeheartedly believe it is integral to continue to carry one-self as an effective leader of UF.
Regardless of accolades and 
organizations, it is most important to me that during my term as Sen-ate president and a leader on cam-pus I maintain my focus on giving back to the students and continu-ally growing as an effective leader in order to best serve the Univer -
sity of Florida.

The Bartram apartments, located at 2337 SW Archer Road, will reopen in the fall after being closed for 
a year for repairs.

After closing its doors for a year, 
The Bartram is reopening in the fall.
The Bartram apartments, located 
at 2337 SW Archer Road, notified 
its residents in March 2011 that it would close indefinitely because the complex had to undergo repairs.
Residents’ leases were not re-
newed, and they had to move out so repairs could be made to the roof, roof trusses, parapet walls, balco-nies and stair landings, said Linda Michalisin, vice president of public relations at Frankel Media Group.
“We are extremely excited about 
reopening The Bartram to residents,” she said.
The Bartram filed a lawsuit that 
is pending against the construction company that did the original work, Michalisin said.
Kristen Meyer, a UF advertis-
ing senior, said she was “really bummed” when she found out she had to move out of her apartment.
Meyer will graduate in May , so 
she will not return to The Bartram next year. Her friend Christina De-Varona will be living in Meyer’s for -
mer apartment.
DeVarona said she is excited for 
next year. She said The Bartram seems almost too nice for a student to live there.
“It’s beautiful,” she said. “It feels 
like you are living in a New York hotel.”
About 50 percent of The Bartram 
community is scheduled to be com-pleted by August. The leasing prices of the units stayed about the same and were not affected by the cost of the repairs, said Michalisin.
The complex started leasing 
apartments about 90 days ago for rooms that will open in the fall, and there are only about 15 units left, she said.
Once the repairs are complete, 
she said, there will be no additional construction.
“We have been overwhelmed by 
new residents interested in living at The Bartram for the first time, as well as previous residents who have chosen to move back,” Michalisin said.Bartram apartments to reopen this fall after closing for repairs10, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 25, 2012

The Save CISE movement is 
officially online.
Forbes.com, a business news 
website, posted an article Sun-
day condemning a proposal that would restructure UF’s Computer and Information and Science Engineering depart-ment. The proposal, which was created by College of Engineer -
ing Dean Cammy Abernathy , is a response to a $4 million bud-get cut by the state legislature.
The article referenced the 
University Athletic Associa-tion’s increased budget, but the author later acknowledged those funds are separate from UF’s.
In about 48 hours, the 
Forbes.com article garnered about 370,000 views and was shared about 68,000 times on Facebook.
Ph.D. student Nuri Yeralan, 
28, one of the leaders in the movement to save the depart-ment, said he’s excited the issue is getting national exposure.
In a statement posted Mon-
day evening on the Forbes website, UF spokeswoman Jan-ine Sikes said the author falsely wrote that UF “is eliminating the Computer Science Depart-ment.”PolitiFact.com, a fact-check-
ing website run primarily by the Tampa Bay Times, rated the Forbes claim as half true.
Many critics of the proposed 
plan have asked why the cuts aren’t being applied across all 10 College of Engineering de-partments. 
According to Sikes’ state-
ment, Abernathy’s proposal will not lay off any tenure-track faculty , but cuts across the board could result in layoffs.
Abernathy told students 
her industry contacts have responded p o s i t i v e l y 
to the pro-posal, but the Forbes article shows a different side of the is-
sue, Yeralan said. 
Because Forbes’ readers are 
mainly businessmen, learning about the potential cut could make them re-evaluate sending recruiters to UF, he said.
“I think people are having 
those conversations now in a very serious way ,” Yeralan said. “They’re actually wary about what’s happening at UF.”

Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe 
spoke to four students in the Reitz 
Union on Tuesday about political activism.
Because of the low turnout, the 
room was rearranged into a circle with Lowe at its center.
The Community Political Affairs 
Cabinet hosted the event.
Lowe discussed how he climbed 
the political ladder, from getting in-volved in environmental and equal-ity issues before getting involved in Democratic Party issues.
He encouraged students to vote 
and told a story about winning the District 4 City Commission seat by 16 votes because of the Reitz Union precinct.
The four students asked him 
questions about being politically involved on an international level, the situation in Syria and the effects social media can have on a future politician.  
Lowe also spoke about the Sis-
ter City Program of Gainesville. He said he went to Israel in Octo-ber to visit the sister cities in the West Bank and Israel. He said that although the cities are only a few miles apart, they no longer commu-nicate with each other, but people there want peace.
Community Political Affairs 
Cabinet Director Claire Miller said she didn’t expect a lot of people to show up because it was during lunch, and people had finals. The 20-year-old public relations junior said the number of students gave it an intimate feel.
“I feel like most students don’t 
have a chance to talk to a mayor on a one-on-one level,” she said.
Student Sen. Brandon Laines 
said he hoped to gain insight on student involvement in politics.
“It provided great insight into 
how students can be active in lo-cal community and national level,” said the 19-year-old economics and math freshman.

A Gainesville movie theater abruptly 
shut down about two months ago and has 
yet to reopen.
In the ticket window of Gator Cinemas, 
off West Newberry Road next to the Oaks Mall, sits an 8-by-12-inch sign with these words: “Renovations are underway. Please bear with us.”  They are typed next to a car-toon grizzly bear.
The majority of tenants in the complex 
said there have not been any signs of life at the theater since it closed about two months ago.
“One day they were putting up new 
movies on the marquee, and a week later they were closed,” said Katrina Bass, an em-ployee at Jason’s Deli ﬁ  ve doors down from the theater.
Some of the theater’s employees used to 
eat at the deli, Bass said.
After it closed, the employees offered the theater’s remaining boxes of candy to near-by Jason’s Deli workers. Bass said she asked the employees who delivered the candy if the theater was reopening. She said they told her it was “closed for good.”
The doors to the theater were unlocked 
Tuesday afternoon, but nobody was inside. Despite the dust piling up on the counters and cobwebs entangled in the popcorn ma-chines, the place still looked like a movie theater.
Three of the four theaters’ aisles were still 
lit. A 6-foot movie poster of “21 Jump Street” and “Men in Black III” still hung from the ceiling, and other smaller posters lined the walls. Boxes to dispose used 3-D glasses still stood in the hallways.
Virginia Fisher, a representative for the 
complex’s landlord company, Southern Management and Development LLC, said she was told not to comment on the situa-tion at Gator Cinemas. She said she did not know if the theater was reopening.
The phone at Gator Cinemas has been 
disconnected, and the manager could not be reached.
“Nobody really knows what’s going on,” 
said Danielle Parker, owner of Family Chris-tian Stores, located next to the theater. “One day they were here. The next day they were gone. And we haven’t seen anyone there since.”
New owners took over Gator Cinemas in 
January 2010, according to Florida Depart-ment of State Corporations. The owner lives in New York.

� INTEREST RATES WILL JUMP FROM 3.4 PERCENT 
TO 6.8 PERCENT IF CONGRESS DOESN’T INTERVENE.

With the Republican Party elections winding down, 
President Barack Obama is pushing forward with his re-
election campaign by connecting with university and col-lege students — the demographic largely credited for his 2008 election.
In a conference call with student reporters Tuesday 
from Air Force One, Obama discussed a measure to keep student loan interest rates low. He spoke for several min-utes and directed questions to staff afterward.
The rates are set to double in July because a congressio-
nal measure that passed in 2007 is set to expire then. The measure kept rates low, but they will jump from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent if Congress does not intervene, said Cecilia Muñoz, deputy assistant to the president.
The White House is asking for a one-
year extension to the measure.
The average college student who 
takes out loans graduates with $25,000 a year in debt, Obama said.“I’ve always believed that we should be doing every-
thing we can to help put higher education within reach for every single American student,” Obama said. “It’s never been more important. Unfortunately, it’s never been more expensive.”
If Congress doesn’t extend the measure, there isn’t 
much the president can do to lower the rates, Muñoz said.
“Unfortunately, it requires legislative authority to 
keep the rates low,” Muñoz said. “We continue to believe the people here in Washington will listen to the voices of their constituents.”

Graduating does not mean the University can’t 
continue to have a role in a graduate’s job search. 
Did you know that alumni can take advantage of the services provided at UF’s Career Resource Cen-ter (CRC) up to one year after graduation?
Whether a recent grad needs to brush up on 
interviewing skills or determine their career in-terests, the CRC offers several workshops and ser -
vices throughout the year to help with on-going career development. Career planning, mock inter -
views, and resume critiquing are just a few of the many services available at the CRC.
Determining next steps after graduation can be 
intimidating and overwhelming.
However, with career planning, recent alumni 
can discuss their goals during one- on-one ap-pointments with the career services staff. Appoint-ments can range from exploring job opportunities to graduate school options.
Those interested in improving their interviewing skills can participate in a mock interview, which can highlight a graduate’s interviewing strengths and provide him or her with tips for improvement. Mock interviews can be done online or in person with a CRC staff member.
Alums are also encouraged to have their re-
sumes reviewed through the Express Drop In Service, where a Career Ambassador provides suggestions for resume enhancement. No appoint-ment is needed for the Express Drop In. Resumes can also be reviewed through the Drop Off Service, where resumes can be dropped off at the front desk and ready for pick up with suggestions within 48 hours.
Graduates can always visit the CRC website at 
www.crc.ufl.edu to access Gator CareerLink for listings of job opportunities available to UF candi-dates. In addition, alumni can attend career events such as Career Showcase, Summer Job and Intern-ship Fair, Education Fair, and Part Time Job Fair throughout their lifetime.
“Alumni can always attend our fairs no matter 
when they’ve graduated. Some employers at Ca-reer Showcase are seeking to fill positions that sea-soned alumni may be more suited for,” said Angel Iverson, assistant director for career events.
If you should need any assistance post-graduation, 
contact the CRC at 352-392-1601, stop by the first floor of the J. Wayne Reitz Union or visit http://www.crc.ufl.edu.

If you’re graduating this semester, you’ve probably re-
ceived an email asking you to take an exit survey regard-
ing your plans following graduation. This survey will assess what educational or career paths students will be taking af-ter completing their current higher education degrees. While individual colleges usually disperse major- specific surveys among their graduates, this is the first time that a survey is being distributed to the entire graduating student body.
The Career Resource Center is disseminating the survey 
in conjunction with the Office of Institutional Planning and Research. Heather White, director of the Career Resource Center, explained that the point of this survey is to uncover how students will be applying their experience at UF to their futures. Upon survey completion, the results will be made available to all of the colleges and stakeholders across cam-pus. “We know that UF students are great, and this will help 
us to tell their story by giving more substance to what is already known,” White emphasized. As of April 20th, the survey has garnered a 40 percent response rate. While a re-sponse rate of at least 50 percent would be great, White said, ‘anything closer to 100 percent is always ideal’.
A final reminder for taking the survey will be sent to grad-
uating students on April 25th, and the survey will stay open for several more weeks. Graduating seniors are encouraged take a few minutes and complete this survey in order to help provide the university with valuable information.
For more information, please contact the Career Resource Cen-
ter at 352-392-1601.

Two ongoing court cases involv-
ing Gainesville residents highlight 
potential issues about how much information realtors should tell buyers about the Cabot/Koppers Superfund site.
A lawsuit filed by Carla Melgar -
ejo in April 2011 accuses her real-tors, Robert and Robin Evans, and Bosshardt Realty Services, of con-cealing knowledge about the Su-perfund site when she purchased the house. The case will go to trial in the fall.
The second case, a foreclosure 
on property owned by Gainesville resident Clara Bea Horton, will not go to trial by jury.
The Cabot/Koppers Superfund 
site is an environmentally toxic site in Northeast Gainesville. Two companies, Cabot Inc. and Koppers Inc., used improper methods to dis-pose of hazardous chemicals. Now, the soil and water at and around the site are contaminated.
Licensed real estate agents are 
required by state law to disclose “all known facts that materially affect the value of residential real property and are not readily ob-servable to the buyer.”
However, Superfund sites are not 
specifically addressed in the statute, Sandi Copes Poreda, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Busi-ness and Professional Regulation, wrote in an email.A representative from Bosshardt 
Realty Services said the organiza-tion cannot comment on an ongo-ing court case.
Melgarejo’s lawsuit states she 
did not know her home, at 444 NW 30th Ave., was less than 100 feet from the western boundary of the Cabot/Koppers Superfund site when she signed in 2004. She learned about the site in 2009 when the Florida Department of Health sent letters to neighbors to tell them about the site and the health hazards associated with the con-taminants.
The lawsuit states the realtors 
knew about the Superfund site but did not disclose that information to the buyer.
While Melgarejo was looking 
at the house, the sellers gave her a property disclosure form that iden-tified toxic substances in or around the property. Asbestos siding was the only item noted.
Melgarejo is suing to get out of 
her contract and to get compensat-ed for damage.
Bosshardt Realty Services and 
the noted realtors responded in court documents, saying they deny all allegations.Documents state the damage 
noted by Melgarejo was caused by third parties over which the defen-dants “have no responsibility, duty, domain or control.”
In the second case, Horton asked 
the court to set aside the sale of her house because the nearby Super -
fund site made it essentially worth-less.
“The dispute is based on the 
fact that … the property is within the area of contamination from the Koppers Superfund site. Accord-ingly, the property is at best value-less and may represent a virtually unlimited CERCLA liability,” court documents state.
Horton said she was not told 
about the site before she bought her home in 2005. She learned about it in about 2008.
Had she been told about the 
site, she said she would have never bought that house.
The U.S. Department of Envi-
ronmental Protection officially de-clared the Cabot/Koppers site a Superfund site in 1984.
After that point, Horton said, 
there was an exodus of people from the neighborhood, and the people who are now filling those homes aren’t always told about the nearby site.
“None of these people have ever 
been disclosed to, and there’s noth-ing that can be done about it,” she said.

Members of the 2012 UF Bateman Case Study Competi-
tion team are one step closer to becoming national champi-ons.
The team was named as national finalists in the Public 
Relations Student Society of America’s Bateman Case Study Competition this week.
UF’s team will join Loyola University New Orleans and 
University of Maryland College Park in the finals next month in Minneapolis. The three teams were chosen out of 70 by the Public Relations Society of America.
“Our recognition as a national finalist reiterates the ex-
emplary quality of instruction and commitment to excellence for which this university has become known,” 22-year-old public relations senior and team member Jared Misner said in an email. “I’m honored to represent the entire Gator Na-tion as we show the country, yet another time, what Gators are made of.”
In September, team members Jerry Bruno, Caroline Lew-
is, Jared Misner, Roberta Roberts and Jonny Shiver began working on a public relations campaign to raise awareness for childhood obesity and to inform children and their par -
ents about adopting healthier lifestyles.
Roberts, a 21-year-old public relations senior, said the 
team worked with about a dozen schools and community organizations to implement the campaign, including United Way of North Central Florida, Florida Organic Growers, the UF College of Medicine’s Mobile Outreach Clinic and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Mid-Florida.
For Lewis, a 22-year-old public relations senior, one of the 
most important things about the competition was to make a positive change in Gainesville.
The team helped people feel they didn’t have to change 
everything about their lifestyles to be healthier, Lewis said. Instead, they could make small changes, such as drinking water in place of soda and walking instead of taking the bus, to see positive results.
“One of the greatest things we did was work with so 
many people in the community that a lot of people still want to continue working on it,” Lewis said.
Teams will present their campaigns to representatives of 
United Way Worldwide and General Mills on May 18. First-place winners will receive $2,500 and a trophy.
The Bateman team is recruiting members for next year’s 
team. Forms and more information can be found at the Pub-lic Relations Department in Weimer Hall.
“The competition is something I can talk about for every 
job interview,” Lewis said. “Not a lot of people can say that they created and implemented a public relations campaign by their senior year.”UF public relations

While most college students are 
still curled up sleeping, Rex Tullius 
sends the first wave of ripples across the surface of Gainesville’s Dwight H. Hunter Pool.
Six days a week, the 25-year-old 
UF graduate student streamlines, kicks, pulls and flip-turns, cranking out about 200 laps in two hours. His goal? Competing in the 2012 Olym-pics.
With three days of weight train-
ing and extra afternoon practices two days each week, training is a full-time job. 
But Tullius said he refuses to 
think of it like that. Practice is a relief from studying and working on proj-ects for his master’s degree in build-ing construction.
Mostly though, practice is the 
only way to ensure he gets a second shot at his Olympic dream.
Four years ago, Tullius found 
himself at his first U.S. Olympic Tri-als in Omaha, Neb. After qualifying for the semifinals in the 100- and 200-meter backstroke, he shaved three seconds off his 200-meter time, landing him in fourth place — just two places and 3.39 seconds away from a spot on the Olympic team.
“Not making the team in 2008 
left me hungry ,” Tullius said. “It was definitely another motivational factor. I thought, ‘Wow. I’m fourth now, so what’s going to happen in 2012?’ You never know.”
At the U.S. Olympic Trials from 
June 25 to July 2 in Omaha, Tullius will again aim for a spot on the U.S. Team. A top-two finish in any of his signature events — 100-meter backstroke, 200-meter backstroke or 200-meter freestyle — will send him packing for the 2012 Summer Games in London.
It won’t be easy . He’ll be up 
against the University of Michigan’s Tyler Clary as well as former Gator and longtime friend Ryan Lochte.
But Ed Buckley , Tullius’ friend 
and business partner for peerFit, an online fitness tool founded in 2010, said he knows Tullius will be able to bring out his competitive side.
“He’s just this goofy , nice guy ,” 
Buckley said. “But seeing him on the pool deck for the first time, he was so locked in and in the zone. Then, he races and he’s right back to his normal self. It’s cool to be able to see him flip that switch and do that.”
Tullius’ coach, 26-year-old Dustin 
Koch, likes Tullius’ chances if he can stay motivated and injury-free.
“He shows up to meets knowing 
he’s done more than anyone else in the pool and has had more individ-ualized attention, and he feels good about being there,” Koch said.
Whenever he starts to lose mo-
tivation and feels like leaving the sport, his father tells him to take the weekend to think about his deci-sion.
“Is the juice really worth the 
squeeze?” Tullius said. “I don’t want to quit and wonder, ‘What if?’”
He said the support he’s gained 
over the past four years from friends and family has helped him press on. Tullius’ friends already talk about booking their flights to watch him race in London.
“His goal is our goal,” Buckley 
said.
His parents, whom Tullius calls 
his biggest fans, continue to follow his eight-year journey to the Olym-pics one meet at a time. When they can’t cheer for him in person, Russel and Carmen Tullius and their three youngest sons huddle around the computer at their Port Orange home, where they watch live-streaming videos of swim meets.
In June, Tullius’ mother will join 
him again at the Olympic Trials. She is ready to relive the experience at the same arena where, four years ago, her son’s performance brought her to tears.
“If all the stars align, he’s going 
to be a tough competitor,” she said. “And you know what? Anything is possible. If anyone can do it, Rex can.”
In the past few years, Tullius has 
earned spots in international com-petitions in China, Mexico, Japan and Switzerland. He hopes to round off his world tour by participating in meets in Brazil, Spain, Italy and other countries.
But for now, only one place is on 
his mind: London.18, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 25, 2012

It’s 11:30 p.m. A woman gets on the Later 
Gator and says to the driver, “I’m sorry, I’ll 
try not to throw up.”
Her two friends apologize to the driver and 
take the woman to the back of the bus, hand-ing her a white plastic bag — just in case.
The driver shakes her head as they walk 
to their seats.
“Oh my gosh,” she mutters as the woozy 
girl begins to hurl. Luckily , her vomit lands in the bag.
This kind of incident is the norm for Later 
Gator bus drivers.
Every Wednesday through Saturday , these 
late-night drivers see many crazy drunks, hear profanity that could hail from the high seas and smell far too much bodily fluid.
“Every driver who works the Later Gator 
has stories,” one driver said.
These Regional Transit System workers 
drive buses that cater mostly to students, pro-viding safe passage home for the inebriated, fatigued and lazy. They drive various routes from downtown to midtown, through and around UF’s campus and back to downtown.
The night begins at 8:30 p.m. Few passen-
gers are on board.
Two hours later, the smell of perfume and 
cheap beer filters through the bus as partygo-ers hop on, ready for a night of tomfoolery.
The women, some in high heels and cleav-
age-baring dresses, take pictures to document the night’s escapades. The guys, sporting button-down shirts and dark-washed jeans, discuss which bar to hit first.
The bus is like a moving gossip grapevine. 
Friends chat about relationships, clubbing, alcohol and sexually transmitted diseases. School is far from their minds.
At 11:20 p.m., the driver asks a group of 
about 10 friends if they’re getting off at the next stop, but they’re talking too loudly to hear him. At the stop, they debate for almost a minute about getting off while the driver waits.
A few thank him as they get off the bus. 
Others walk past.
“Be safe!” the driver shouts after them. 
Once again, they don’t seem to hear him.
“People are rude during the day ,” he said. 
“Add alcohol to the equation. What do you think happens?”
But this behavior is not unusual. Later 
Gator drivers have experienced it all.
And even if they hand passengers a trash 
can, not everyone has good aim.
If the bus is contaminated by any type of 
bodily fluid, the driver reports the situation to dispatch and takes the bus to be sanitized by the maintenance crew at the station, said Chip Skinner, spokesman for RTS.
The drivers have been trained to respond 
to all kinds of situations, including when rid-ers get “overly intimate,” he said. Each sum-mer, they go through a training program to remind them of policies and procedures.
The go-to action is to report the issue to 
dispatch, he said. The night’s supervisor will then respond and meet the bus to deal with the problem, particularly if it involves a phys-ical fight.Skinner said drivers are allowed to turn 
away students who seem too unruly . RTS has a handful of students who are banned from using the bus system because of bad behavior, he said.
The buses, which stop running at 3 a.m., 
are free to UF students, but some drivers stop checking for Gator 1 Cards late at night.
“I’d rather they not drive,” a bus driver 
said.
But sometimes they have to refuse entry if 
the bus is too full.
Between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., students 
squeeze into the buses as bars start to close.
It’s a claustrophobic person’s nightmare.As bodies are pressed together, it’s hard 
not to inhale an intoxicating combination of colognes, perfumes, bad breath and sweat.
Stephanie Nguyen gets off the bus on 
Southwest Second Avenue and welcomes the Florida heat. She said she thinks the drivers blast the air conditioning to prevent the bus from smelling.
The 21-year-old microbiology senior said 
she takes the bus from her downtown apart-ment to the bars on University Avenue at least three times a week. She has witnessed and been involved in the craziness that occurs after a fun-filled night out.
She said she has seen girls flirt shamelessly 
with drivers in the hopes they will stop at their doorsteps — a trick she has never seen work.
She has also seen small scuffles start and 
has heard passengers whine and call the driv-er names.
“As a bus driver, you see so much that 
nothing really fazes you, so you don’t feel the need to react to everything,” she said. “I feel like most people in public service jobs are un-derappreciated.”
Every time Nguyen waits for the bus, she 
said, she secretly hopes for a particular driver: the one who always seems to be in a good mood, inquires about her evening plans and reminds her to stay safe.
Not all drivers are as friendly , she said. 
However, their foul mood is often under -
standable, like the time her friend threw up into a bag that, apparently, was too small.
“We tried to clean up, but I don’t think we 
did a good job,” she said. “The driver clear -
ly was not happy . She gave us a very dirty look.”
Despite the rowdy crowd, some driv-
ers enjoy working the late shift. Skinner said many drivers like having the day free, and others need the overtime.
The shifts are assigned through bids. The 
senior drivers get to pick their schedules first, so the Later Gator shifts are often taken by less-experienced drivers.
He said many empathize with students, as 
they recall their own college days.
They understand that dealing with drunk-
en students is part of the job. It’s not easy , but it’s routine.
It’s just another night on the Later Gator.
Later Gator drivers give drunk passengers a safe ride home
“I feel like most people in public 
service jobs are underappreciated.”

Alligator Staff Writer
When Shira Reid shows people around her workplace, she 
makes sure to introduce them to Iris. Iris is smart and outgoing, 
and she and Reid could chat all day.
When they get excited, their voices rise like 13-year-old girls 
at a school dance.
Iris wraps her tail around the wire of her habitat cage, raises 
her eyebrows and rocks from side to side. Reid, 28, is a caregiv-ing apprentice at Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary.
On weekends, she gives tours. On Saturday , she turned and 
explained to a tour group that Iris, a brown capuchin monkey , was flirting with them.
The group stood for another minute, then moved on to see 
more of the 155 monkeys housed there. The Gainesville non-profit is not open to the public, but volunteers can tour the sanctuary. Jungle Friends takes in former pets, lab testing sub-jects and circus monkeys and gives them a “forever home.”
But after two more habitats are built, the Jungle Friends staff 
will have maxed out its 12 acres of land, and people want it to take more monkeys.
They have to build the habitats 100 feet in from the property 
lines, said Lee Ward, 56, the sanctuary’s head caregiver. The neighbors don’t want monkeys throwing biscuits at them or waking them up with early-morning chattering.
Kari Bagnall, 58, who founded Jungle Friends in 1998, said 
the nonprofit needs $250,000 to be able to buy the 20-acre lot next door and expand. Requests to take monkeys are flooding in, but the cash flow is dribbling. The money that has come in recently is going to the two habitats being built on the current grounds.
It’s not cheap to run a primate sanctuary — $20,000 to 
$25,000 a month, Bagnall estimated. There’s maintenance, out-door heat lamps, medical expenses and food.
Marmosets alone have a breakfast bowl of fruits, vegetables, 
rice or cereal, soup and canned marmoset food — and they’re only 8 inches long from head to toe.
That size doesn’t matter, though, when they’re leaping 
across the cage for food.
One of the marmosets nibbled on a raisin-sized chunk of 
citrus. The monkeys peered up like they were sizing up the passersby. Some of them climbed to eye level, and they reached long-fingered hands out between the bars to greet one of the Jungle Friends workers.
They’re so human, Bagnall said, that people think they can 
be the child a couple is missing. Breeders say they make great pets, and people want to raise them from infancy.
“You just type in ‘monkey’ on Google and you get all those 
pet monkey sites,” she said.
The pet industry was what got Jungle Friends started in 
the first place. Years ago, Bagnall’s boyfriend bought her a pet monkey named Samantha. The brown capuchin attached her -
self to her owner’s arm. Bagnall had to teach the monkey to switch arms so she could get dressed every morning.“I’m sure there’s a 12-step program for that,” she joked.Bagnall eventually left the boyfriend but kept the monkey. 
She wanted to find Samantha a friend, she said, and she located Samantha’s sister, Charlotte, who was with a breeder. Bagnall couldn’t afford to buy Charlotte, so she helped care for the monkeys in exchange for Charlotte. From there, she started col-lecting exotic animals, but Bagnall eventually decided to limit herself to monkeys.
Internet research indicated that the humidity in Gainesville 
would be better for the monkeys than the dry heat of her home in Las Vegas, so Bagnall sold almost everything she owned to make the move and start Jungle Friends.
It wasn’t much in the beginning. In 1998, 13 monkeys were 
installed in four makeshift habitats meant for storing corn. But over the years, more people heard about the institute, more workers came, and Ward moved from Texas after a few years of traveling between her home and the preserve in Gainesville.
Ward and her partner now live in a small, one-story house, a 
five-minute walk from the office at Jungle Friends. She started her own smaller private sanctuary, Koreymonde Capuchin Rescue, in 2007. Ward named it after her first monkey, Korey, a white-faced capuchin. Korey has since been joined by 20 other white-faced capuchins and a 15-year-old goose named Abby.
Between the two monkey sanctuaries, though, lie 20 acres of 
open fields with a small house. If Bagnall could buy the prop-erty for Jungle Friends before someone else snatches it up, she could have more living space for interns, room for expansion and easy access to Koreymonde.
They could bring in more monkeys, and Bagnall said her 
ultimate goal is to see animals out of research and monkeys out of the pet trade.
But in the short term, this land could make a big difference 
for Jungle Friends. Even if she couldn’t afford to build, Bag-nall could hold on to the land until she has more money. She could eventually build an on-site veterinary clinic and maybe get equipment donated.
She could save lives and give a home to monkeys that have 
never had them.
But she needs help.Contact Clare Lennon at clennon@alligator.org.WEDNESDAY, APRIL 25, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 19

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW ORLEANS — Federal prosecutors 
brought the first criminal charges Tuesday 
in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, accusing Kurt Mix, a former BP engineer, of destroying evidence by deleting more than 300 text mes-sages, including a finding that the blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico was spewing far more crude oil than the company was telling the public.
Here are some questions and answers 
about Mix, the charges and the investiga-tion.
Q: Who is Mix?A: Mix, of Katy, Texas, was a drilling 
and completions project engineer for BP . He worked on estimating the amount of oil spewing from the blown-out well and was involved in efforts to stop the gusher, nota-bly a procedure known as a “top kill.” The “top kill” method involved pumping heavy mud into the well head to cap it. Though BP had high hopes it would work, it ultimately failed when the immense pressure of oil and natural gas escaping the well could not be overcome by the mud.
Q: What is Mix accused of doing?A: Mix has been charged with two counts 
of obstruction of justice and faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 on each count. Specifically, he has been ac-cused of deleting more than 200 messages sent to a BP supervisor from his iPhone in October 2010 containing information about how much oil was spilling out — and then erased 100 more the following year after re-ceiving numerous legal notices from BP to preserve the information.
Mix was released on $100,000 bail. He 
surrendered his passport and can only travel between Louisiana and Texas. His next court appearance is scheduled for May 3. His attor -
ney declined to comment after the hearing.
Q: Why did the charges come two years 
after the spill, and will they impact the civil settlement?
A: The arrest is part of a criminal investi-
gation launched June 1, 2010, by the Justice Department, a probe that is still ongoing. The charges are not likely to affect the proposed class-action settlement that would resolve more than 100,000 claims by people and businesses who blame economic losses over the spill.
BP PLC estimates it will pay about $7.8 
billion to resolve these claims, but the agree-ment doesn’t resolve any claims by the Gulf states or the Justice Department, which launched civil and criminal probes following the spill. A judge is set Wednesday to consid-er preliminary approval of the class-action settlement.
Q: Are more arrests expected?A: It’s not clear, but Attorney General Eric 
Holder said the “department has filed initial charges in its investigation,” signaling more charges are likely to come. The Justice De-partment said the investigation into Mix and “other matters concerning the Deepwater Horizon disaster is ongoing.”
David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan 
law professor who was chief of the Justice Department’s environmental crimes section, said the charges are probably “just the first of what will be multiple criminal charges.”
“It could be the sign that the government 
believes there was a more far-reaching cover-up about the size of the spill,” he said.
Q: The arrest involved what happened 
after the spill. What about any wrongdoing before the explosion on the rig?
A: During Congressional hearings in the 
months after the oil spill, executives of BP PLC and other companies working with them were grilled about what they knew and when before the explosion, so there is little doubt investigators are looking into this as well.

Lauren Embree has always said that watching is 10 times 
worse than playing. But down 4-0 to Stanford’s Mallory Bur -
dette in the third set of a match that would decide the 2010-11 
national championship, Embree had her doubts.
So did her best friend, standing courtside. Minutes earlier, 
Joanna Mather had lost her match and, she thought, potentially the national championship. Florida’s hopes rested on Embree’s small yet powerful shoulders.
Mather was shaking from the cold. Her best friend was 
shaking from nerves.
  
Roland Thornqvist has a philosophy about doubles teams. The tall, Swedish head coach of the Gators has stuck by his 
belief that best friends don’t necessarily make the best doubles teams. With a 270-31 record as coach, it’s hard to challenge Thornqvist’s beliefs.
“I don’t like to do that because they see enough of each oth-
er,” he said. “Sometimes when you play and you would lose, it’d create some drama.”
But with Embree and Mather, he made an exception. “They’re really good friends, and, at first, I was apprehen-
sive, perhaps they were too good of friends, but their record speaks for itself,” he said.
Although Embree and Mather quickly became friends upon 
Embree’s arrival in the summer of 2009, they were not doubles partners initially and wouldn’t play together in a match until April of that season.
In 2010, the spring of Embree’s freshman year, she was 
playing with Anastasia Revzina, a senior. The duo was fantas-tic, going 14-2 during the dual match season. 
Mather played with Caroline Hitimana and Claire Bartlett, 
going a combined 10-3 with those pairings. But before the April 9 match against Tennessee, Thornqvist made a switch.
“We found that they really communicated, and that’s really 
the key to any pairing,” he said. “They complement each other where Joanna is very powerful, Lauren has a lot of courage and likes to move off of Joanna’s pace.”
From there, the duo of Embree and Mather has been as 
dominant as any doubles team in the country. They have won 45 of 46 matches, including a perfect 20-0 record this season. It’s been almost two years since they lost to Mississippi’s Gabby Rangel and Connor Vogel.
As important as their complementary tennis styles are, 
Embree, Mather and Thornqvist all agree that chemistry is the most vital part of their success. 
As they have grown on the court both in singles and dou-
bles, they have grown closer together. Now, they are best friends and roommates. They can often be seen interacting on Twitter, with Embree (@lembree888) and Mather (@JoMather1) exchanging pictures, jokes and encouragement.
At times, the girls said, they have an almost telepathic abil-
ity to know where the other one will be.
“Most of the time, I know what Lauren is going to do, what 
balls she’s going to cross on, or whether she’s going to try to lob or hit the ball,” Mather said. 
Said Embree: “She’s pretty athletic, so if she does something weird, I know somehow it’ll go in. Because we’ve been playing with each other for so long, I think we both know what’s going to happen. Sometimes we don’t even call plays.”
  
If all goes well, Embree and Mather have six team matches 
remaining. Next month, they will likely have the opportunity to help No. 2 UF win its second consecutive national title.
That certainly won’t be the end of their friendship, but it 
will be the end of their doubles partnership as Gators.
Mather will graduate in May with a degree in management. 
She plans to pursue tennis professionally before going to grad-uate school down the road. 
“I’m not ready for a job yet,” she said with a laugh.Embree will return for one final season in Gainesville, where 
she will be a senior leader of a Florida team that will have the talent to again compete for a national title. 
But for the first time in two years, she will be searching for 
a new doubles partner.
  
As soon as Embree won the next two games against Bur -
dette, Mather knew the direction of the match had changed.
“When she won those two games at 4-2, Mallory started 
making more mistakes and Lauren was just so solid, and I just remember thinking ‘Lauren’s got this’.”
Embree won four of the next six games, throwing the match 
into a deadlock. Two of the nation’s top players were going into a third-set tiebreak — first to seven, win by two.
They went back and forth, on mini-runs and mini-collapses. 
Leading 7-6, Embree was returning serve. 
After a rally , Burdette loaded up to deliver a forehand. It 
sailed wide. Out.
During the celebration that followed, Embree eventually 
found Mather, crying. That led her to tears as well. It was a feeling unlike anything they had ever felt.
“Looking back on how hard our team worked and how hard 
we pushed each other and stayed together as a team meant so much to all of us,” Embree said.
“Just being able to trust each other and trust ourselves and 
then everything paying off,” Mather said.
“It was amazing.”Dominant partnership coming to close for Embree, Mather

The Gators had finally cracked 
Matt Reed. 
South Florida’s slow-tossing 
southpaw starter aggravated Florida 
for five innings before giving up two homers and three runs. The Gators tied the game 3-3 heading into the seventh. 
Daniel Gibson then walked Alex 
Mendez to start the inning. 
“That changed the momen-
tum of the game,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “Guys started feel-ing really good about themselves. We had battled back. It was a frus-trating night. The next thing you know we’re battling with a runner on first.”
Gibson was pulled, and four bat-
ters later junior Jimmy Falla singled in Mendez. The Bulls (28-14) then cruised to a 5-3 win against the No. 5 Gators (31-10). 
Florida didn’t feel good about 
itself until the sixth inning. No bas-erunner other than Daniel Pigott reached scoring position against Reed, and he was stranded at sec-ond in the second, fifth and sixth innings. 
O’Sullivan had preached to his 
team: Don’t hit fly balls against Reed, the 6-foot-3, 210-pound pitch-er. The Gators hit 11 of their 13 fly-ball outs in the game during Reed’s 5.2 innings. 
USF continued to roll out a train 
of soft-throwing relievers, two of them left-handers, after Reed de-parted. Florida never adjusted to the steady diet of off-speed pitches.
“With our staff, we can’t simulate 
that,” Pigott said. “It’s difficult to make that adjustment, but we’ve got to be able to do it.”
Defense became an issue after 
Nolan Fontana and Mike Zunino fi-nally hit two fly balls deep enough to leave McKethan Stadium. It start-ed in the seventh with Falla and con-tinued into the eighth. Senior catcher Andrew Longley led off the eighth with a homer to left-center. It was his second blast of the game, the first coming on a 2-2 pitch in the sixth. 
“Rebound runs, they kill you,” 
Fontana said. “They definitely did.”
The Gators out-hit the Bulls 10-9 
but also left 10 runners on base. 
Freshman right-hander John-
ny Magliozzi got the start for the Gators and lasted a season-long 4.2 innings. Neither of the two runs he was charged with were earned, but no reliever could find stabil-ity in the game until Keenan Kish worked hitless frames in the eighth

Florida frustrated in midweek home loss to South Florida

Florida played two nearly identical 
games on Tuesday when it faced off against 
LSU. 
However, while the first was highlight-
ed by late-game heroics and drama, the sec-ond was stained with disappointment.
Hannah Rogers and LSU starter Ra-
chele Fico raised the tension in Katie Sea-shole Stadium by each pitching six innings of shutout ball to start out the two-game series. The excitement reached a pinnacle when the Tigers jumped out to a one-run lead in the seventh and pushed the Gators to their final strike.
Then, on a 1-2 count with two outs, En-
sley Gammel drove the crowd into a roar by sending Fico’s pitch over the right-field wall to tie the game at 1-1. 
“It was probably one of her first op-
posite-field home runs of her career,” coach Tim Walton said. “She really fought through that at-bat, which was really key to our success that game. That’s the mentality of our program — we’re not just going to roll over.”
Rogers breezed through LSU hitters 
in the next frame to match a season-high eight innings pitched. In the bottom half, 
Florida made sure Rog-ers wouldn’t have to go nine.
Freshman Jessica 
Damico represented the Gators’ winning run on first base after getting hit by a pitch for the just the second time all season. Michelle Moultrie then 
delivered an RBI double to send the fans and her teammates into a frenzy . 
“Those are the type of moments you live 
for,” Moultrie said. “Sometimes it doesn’t work out but when it does it’s great. It just felt good to come through, just to get the win [and] a comeback from behind.”UF splits doubleheader with LSUTelling you w ATTS up
What is family? 
For years, I thought I had ev-
erything you could ask for: loving 
parents, a nice home and plenty of presents under the tree at Christmas. Sharon, my mom, went above and beyond her respon-sibility. When she married my father, Will, and gave birth shortly thereafter to my brother, she stopped working and focused on being the best mom she could be. She drove us to T-ball games, helped us with our homework and rubbed Neosporin on our cuts and scrapes. 
I went to the best schools, ate the best 
meals and lived a happy life.
Then, almost seven years ago, that all 
changed. The worst part is that the signs were there. We should have known it was coming. 
When she first broke the news, he broke 
down. A SWAT team had to be called. He holed himself up in our home inside Hidden Hills Country Club, which up until that night was, to me, a sanc-tuary , a haven from the lives of those not “privileged” enough to live be-hind its gates.
After trying for 
nine months to con-vince Sharon, his 
queen, not to leave him after 26 years of mar -
riage, he couldn’t take the pain any longer. He did the unthinkable. 
The .22-caliber bullet entered underneath 
her left eye, penetrating her skull and lodg-ing in the brain stem, causing instant death. Her body fell over in a heap. Will kneeled near her, the mother of two of his four chil-dren, and pulled the trigger again. I never got to say goodbye. 
Soon after their deaths, Carla and Traci, 
half-sisters from my father’s first failed mar -
riage, decided that the will he left behind Departing editor discovers true

wasn’t fair. They sued. That’s 
how I know where the bullet entered Mom’s brain, how she fell to the ground. 
  Carla and Traci’s lawyer 
thought it would be a good idea to show us pictures and diagrams, explaining the scene like something out of a bad episode of CSI. It could be a setup, they said. There could have been a third person, they said. How do we know Matt or his brother didn’t do it, they asked. 
  This is family? This is what 
loved ones do?
  For years after, those mem-
ories have haunted me.
They still do.   After questioning my fu-
ture, questioning the mean-ing of family and my own self-worth, I pushed through the pain and put in the work to get to where I am today — graduating from the only uni-versity I have ever wanted to attend as the sports editor of one of the best student news-papers around. 
  There are plenty of people 
who would tell you that I would never have made it this far. I did it for them, and for her. Mom deserved to see her son become a success, whether she could truly see it or not.
  Throughout my two years 
at the Alligator, I have been the punchline of joke after joke about my age. Some of you knew why I was such an old bastard. Some didn’t. But none of you ever treated me differently because of it. 
  Everyone — there’s too 
many to name — at this paper has touched me in a way I will never forget. Finally , there’s not any questions. Finally , I feel at peace with where I am in life. 
  And ﬁ  nally, I have a mean-
ing of family I know I can be-lieve in.

WATTS , from page 27 Whitson to start tonight against BCC
and ninth. 
  Junior Austin Maddox was sent 
down to the bullpen at one point, but 
none of UF’s leading relief pitchers was used.
  Florida had an ideal opportunity 
in the ninth with two outs and the bases loaded for Zunino. He ground-ed out to shortstop Kyle Teaf on a 1-2 count to end the game.
  “We didn’t do a good job at all as 
an entire lineup,” Fontana said. “We were jumping out of our stances a little bit.”
  The win snapped a 12-game los-
ing streak against the Gators for the Bulls. It was the ﬁ  rst time Florida had lost to South Florida since O’Sullivan became coach. 
  The Gators now move forward 
to another midweek game tonight at 7 against Bethune-Cookman. O’Sullivan said sophomore Karsten Whitson will get the start with an un-certain pitch-count limit.
  “We gotta get him going, simple 
as that,” O’Sullivan said. “We’re go-ing to need him down the stretch.” 
BASEBALL , from page 27
Moultrie drives in winning run in Game 1
  With the hit, UF’s lone senior collected her seventh 
game-winning RBI on the year, which is second only to 
Lauren Haeger’s nine. 
Florida (42-6, 19-3 Southeastern Conference) won 2-1, 
but   dropped the second game, 1-0, to No. 23 LSU (33-16, 14-8 SEC). 
 Once again, the pitching for both teams dominated. 
The only difference was that LSU scored in the second rather than waiting until the seventh. 
  The Tigers took a 1-0 lead into the sixth when Gammel, 
a hero in the ﬁ  rst game, had a chance to keep UF alive again with the bases loaded and two outs. But Gammel couldn’t come through and instead grounded out.
  “Different pitcher, different outcome,” Gammel said. “We were in the same mood as the ﬁ  rst game. We wanted to go up there and ﬁ  ght and we did. It just didn’t work out the way we wanted to.”
  But Florida kept its head above water when Moultrie 
stepped up to the plate with two outs in the seventh and a runner on ﬁ  rst base. Although she couldn’t tie the game, she reached ﬁ  rst on a dropped throw, leav-ing it up to freshman Sami Fagan.
  The magic ran out when she struck 
out to end the game.
  “To take a split [Tuesday] you can 
say was a victory given the circum-stances with the ﬁ  rst game,” Walton 
said. “Either one of these teams could have won either one of these games.” SOFTBALL , from page 27
