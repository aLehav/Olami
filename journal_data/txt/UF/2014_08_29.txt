Students can climb down the stairs 
of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and into an 
Uber car this weekend for free.
The global app-powered ride service 
is now available in Gainesville, and it 
is offering users free transportation for 
their first five rides through Labor Day.
“Anywhere you are, you press a but-
ton, and within a matter of minutes, a vehicle shows up for you,” said Uber spokesman Taylor Bennett.
UF Student Body President Cory Yef-
fet said in an email that students have wanted an alternative and safe transpor-
tation option like Uber for some time.“I am most excited that students now 
have a reliable, easy-to-use and conve-
nient method of transportation when-ever they need one,” Yeffet said.
This weekend, the service will also 
donate $5 to Dance Marathon each time a 
user enters the promotional code UFSG.
Dominique Falconeiri, a 21-year-old 
UF advertising senior, said it will be 
useful to students who walk home late at night and those who need safe rides home from Midtown or downtown.
Falconeiri used Uber during the sum-
mer in New York and thinks it will take 
about a semester to catch on.
“You can be really drunk and still use 
Uber,” she said. “It’s so easy once you 
have it.”VOLUME 109 ISSUE 5 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG FRIDAY, AUGUST 29, 2014

� TIPS FOR TAILGATING, PARKING 
AND STAYING SAFE.
DANIELA PRIZONT-CADO
Alligator Contributing Writer
New school year, new football season.
A melting pot of Gator fans all teeming 
with spirit will swamp the UF campus Sat-
urday as the Gators take on the University 
of Idaho Vandals.
For Florida fans, game days are about 
more than just the football.
University Police recommends taking 
several precautions for fans tailgating and attending the game.  
About 150 police officers will work from 
within the stadium, UPD Lt. Alton McDil-da said.
“Game days are very, very festive and 
hectic, but overall it’s an enjoyable experi-
ence,” McDilda said.
In the first half, the heat could be accom-
panied by some showers.For those attending the event, “get ready 
for rain, especially the first half,” with a 50 
percent chance of showers, said Matt Zibu-ra, a National Weather Service forecaster.
With temperatures expected to be in the 
low 80s and mid 70s Saturday, staying hy-drated for Gator fans is key.
When consuming alcohol, hydration of-
ten becomes an issue.
“People forget that they need to hydrate 
with water,” McDilda said. He suggested people have 16 ounces of water for every 
12 ounces of beer or each shot of alcohol 
they consume.

except in tailgating areas, and alcohol is not First gameday of the seasonNathalie Dortonne / alligator Staff
UF President Bernie Machen addresses a crowd about UF’s preeminence initiative at his annual State of the University 
address. This was his last address after a decade-long tenure as president before the university finds a replacement.
� HE FOCUSED ON UF PREEMINENCE GOALS.
ALYSSA FISHER
Alligator Staff Writer afisher@alligator.org
For the final time in his decade-long tenure at UF, 
President Bernie Machen took to the lectern for his 
State of the University address Thursday.
The speech focused on the UF Rising to National 
Preeminence initiative and introduced new leaders, like the CEO of UF Health Shands Hospital.
UF’s ambitious plan to become a top 10 university 
has recently gained substantial financial backing. Ma-chen said research contracts and grants increased from $641 million to $702 million within the last year. An-nual donations reached $215.3 million, topping $2 mil-lion for the second year. 
“Donors are inspired by preeminence,” Machen 
said to the crowd in Emerson Alumni Hall. 
In addition to discussing expanding research facili-
ties by more than 3 million square feet, Machen em-
phasized undergraduate education. Core classes on 
climate change and data have been added to degrees to lead students to the future.
His initiatives were well received.“Undergraduates absolutely need to understand 
the world to function and compete in the global econ-omy,” said Leonardo Villalon, the new dean of the In-ternational Center.
The 12th president will take over a healthy univer-
sity, Machen said.
“We need to keep raising the bar on education,” 
Machen said. “The state of the university is strong.”Machen delivers last State of the University address

Challenge Accepted

� THEY ARE AT A FOUR-
YEAR LOW.
BRADLEY NORMAN
Alligator Staff Writer 
Gainesville is expected to 
surge with travelers Saturday 
for the opening football game, but Gators fans are not the only people planning trips.
Labor Day travel is expected 
to be at its highest since 2008, according to an American Au-tomobile Association report. About 34.7 million Americans will journey this weekend.
Though airfare and mid-
range hotel prices are rising, gasoline prices are at a four-
year low. About 85 percent of 
people are expected to travel by car, the report stated. Florida’s average gas price is 
$3.37 — six cents cheaper than the national average, according to AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge Re-port. Last year’s national aver-age was $3.59. In Gainesville, 
prices average about $3.41. 
Gas station manager Kyle 
Crawford, 24, said prices at his 
University Avenue BP station have dropped recently.
“We don’t set the gas prices; 
we have a corporate ofﬁ  ce that calls us twice a day and tells us what to set the gas prices at,” 
Crawford said.
Amanda Aguero, a 20-year-
old UF English junior, said she’s 
noticed gas is cheaper.
“On my way up to 
Gainesville last week I actu-ally saw gas for as low as $3.20, which was really surprising to me,” Aguero said.Lower gas prices for 
Labor Day weekend
Note: no parking on Plaza of the Americas, beware roam towing
to be taken inside the stadium. Tailgating 
areas can be found all over campus, unless indicated otherwise by ﬂ  agging tape.
Although individual water bottles are 
not permitted inside the stadium, on days when the heat is unbearable, McDilda said, heat initiatives like water bottle sales will be put in place.
Competitive UF cheerleader Kristen 
Morga, a 19-year-old UF nursing sopho-more, will usher the Swamp stands Satur-day.
Morga said fans should go all out on 
Gator gear to show their spirit for the game 
and estimate time to ﬁ  nd parking.“Make the best out of the game,” she 
said.
This year, there will be no gameday 
parking on the Plaza of the Americas, UF 
spokesman Steve Orlando wrote in an email.
Orlando said although tailgating is still 
permitted in that area, the school wants to 
prevent any further damage to grass, tree 
roots and sidewalks.
The Gainesville City Commission re-
cently raised towing rates from $76 to $100 for those parking illegally, so fans should 
plan to ﬁ  nd parking before the event.GAMEDAY , from page 1 “Make the best out of the game.”

OBITUARY
MELISSA MIHM
Alligator Staff Writer mmihm@alligator.org
Gainesville suffered the loss of 
an iconic performer Wednesday to 
colon and liver cancer.
Ocala-born William Moorehead, 
better known as Lady Pearl, was a staple at University Club nightclub. With her big hair, glamorous gowns and sassy personality, the city of 
Gainesville is now missing a capti-
vating character. She was 54.
The nightclub, located at 18 E. 
University Ave., was her second home. Behind the horseshoe-shaped bar, a neon sign now reads, “She may be gone, but she will never, ever be forgotten.” 
Moorehead, who identiﬁ  ed as a 
woman, said Pearl was a reﬂ  ection of her mind. In a video interview, she said was deeply connected to her character.
India Brooks, a fellow drag queen 
and close friend of Pearl’s, said Pearl was vulgar onstage but motherly and kind behind the scenes. She re-called a show they hosted together on Pearl’s birthday in the early ‘90s. After Pearl’s performance, Brooks took the microphone to perform her set, but Pearl wasn’t done. 
“Give me that microphone,” 
Pearl said sassily to Brooks. 
“Your fat a** can’t catch me,” 
Brooks said before running away as Pearl playfully chased her.
After running around and up and 
down stairs, Pearl ﬁ  nally caught up, snatching Brooks’ wig off. Brooks then smashed Pearl’s own birthday cake in her face. 
“It was a wig-slinging cake ﬁ  ght,” 
Brooks said. When Pearl moved to Fayette-
ville, North Carolina, near the end of her career, she committed to 16-hour road trips to Gainesville for perfor-mances. Backstage at UC, she took one hour to apply thick eyelashes, sculpt her eyebrows and carefully paint her lips before each show. 
Under the club’s lights, Pearl 
found comfort. Her drag queen show lasted more than 20 years. She left William Moorehead behind as she sang, danced and ﬂ  ailed her manicured hands, making fun of fans in her rich Southern accent.Even as patrons put dollar bills in 
her hands and down her shirt dur-ing shows, Pearl never slipped out of character. 
UC bartender Kenny Scott lived 
with Pearl in the early ‘90s. For 20 years, Scott said Pearl packed the club with about 300 fans each Thurs-day.
“University Club will be missing 
something big,” Scott said.
He said the club is planning a 
memorial service that will be open to fans.
“It’ll never be the same,” he said.

Darts & Laurels
The Emmys were on Monday, and AMC smash hit 
“Breaking Bad” cleaned up for the ﬁ  fth year in a row. Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn each won 
in their respective categories, as did Moira Walley-Beckett for 
writing “Ozymandias,” the show’s heart-stopping third-to-
last episode. The show also won in the Outstanding Drama Series category, beating out other excellent series, including 
“Game of Thrones,” “True Detective” and “House of Cards.” 
“Breaking Bad” is undoubtedly one of the most innovative, 
complex and entertaining shows in modern TV history. It’s 
only ﬁ  tting that Walter White goes out on top. We award a Crystal-Blue-Persuasion LAUREL to the Emmy voters. 
“Breaking Bad’s” strong performance at the Emmys 
wasn’t the only award-show-related news from the week. 
Miley Cyrus took a break from swinging naked on construc-tion equipment, twerking and whatever else she does on the 
weekend to attend the MTV Video Music Awards. Cyrus 
opted to have Jesse Helt, a 22-year-old homeless man, accept 
her Best Video of 2014 award. Helt spoke about the chronic 
issue of homelessness in Los Angeles. Cyrus’ decision to use the young man as the face for her cause was quickly clouded 
by controversy. News surfaced that Helt faces arrest in Or-
egon for failing to meet the standards of his probation stem-ming from a criminal trespassing charge. Despite her chosen 
spokesman’s questionable past, it does seem that Miley’s 
heart was mostly in the right place. This week, a remarkably 
socially aware LAUREL goes to The Artist Formerly Known 
as Hannah Montana.
Florida went to the polls this week and nominated Charlie 
Crist and Rick Scott for the respective gubernatorial nomina-tions of the Democratic and Republican parties. In the weeks 
leading up to the primary elections, Floridians were bom-
barded with an endless barrage of emails, phone calls and mailings promoting the various candidates. The desire for 
political candidates to get their message out is understand-
able, but it seems likely that this information overload is frus-trating voters more than it is educating them. Unfortunately, 
Florida residents can expect a major escalation of the political 
advertising wars in the two remaining months before the gen-eral election in November. A leave-us-alone DART to pesky 
political ads.
One of the biggest stories of the NFL offseason was the 
drafting of Michael Sam, former Southeastern Conference De-
fensive Player of the Year, by the St. Louis Rams. Sam became 
the ﬁ  rst openly gay player to be selected in the NFL Draft. De-spite endless media coverage about potentially difﬁ  cult ad-
justments in the Rams locker room, the most prominent Sam-
related headlines came when he sacked noted partier and bird-ﬂ  ipper Johnny Manziel in a preseason game. Naturally, 
ESPN decided to go off the deep end this week by airing a 
report about which St. Louis players have shared the shower room with Sam. Although ESPN quickly apologized for this 
ridiculous and offensive non-story, the report is proof that the 
sensationalizing of Michael Sam’s sexuality is not done just yet. We’re giving a how-tone-deaf-can-you-be? DART to the 
Worldwide Leader in Ill-Advised Sports Stories.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgThursday’s question: Have you been 
to the Student Recreation and Fitness Center recently?Today’s question: Will you be tailgating this weekend?Corporate tax inversions hurt America
Few people — other than maybe a few masochists — 
enjoy paying their taxes each year. Generally, we feel the government is taking a big bite out of our 
paychecks and leaving us poor souls with scraps. Despite our moaning and groaning, most of us pay what we owe, and our threats to evade taxes or ﬂ  ee the country never come to fruition. 
That last sentence is true for most average citizens, 
but when we start talking about the corporations of our great nation, some would rather abandon the U.S. entirely than pay their fair share to the federal government. Most recently, Miami-based fast-food giant Burger King made national headlines after it acquired Tim Horton’s, a Cana-dian burger joint, and told investors Burger King’s corpo-rate headquarters was heading across the border.
By moving its headquarters, Burger King can avoid 
paying federal taxes through a process called inversion. Essentially, American-based companies buy foreign com-panies and then move their headquarters overseas. It’s a giant loophole in the corporate tax structure, and it’s cost-ing our country dearly. 
If Burger King were an individual and not a corpora-
tion, moving overseas would not remove the King from his tax liability. He would still owe the American govern-ment for the income he made in the U.S.—and for Burger King, it’s a sizable share of its business. If the King refused to pay his income taxes, he could be charged with tax eva-sion, facing a hefty ﬁ  ne and possible jail time. 
If it sounds ludicrous that a corporation can get away 
with this but an individual can’t, that’s because it is. There is no reason why any corporation based in the U.S. should be able to exploit this loophole, leaving the federal govern-ment and the American people to pick up the tab. 
You might be a government-hating Tea-Party conser-
vative, but if the corporate tax base continues to leave the U.S. in droves, it’s going to affect all of us. None of us wants higher taxes, but we the people will pay the price for the actions of companies like Burger King. 
Sure, we can continue to cut 
the federal budget down to the bone to make up for lost rev-enue, but eventually we’re going to need to pay for our infrastruc-ture, care for our veterans and support other essential govern-
ment programs and departments. This is not about a lib-eral or conservative argument about how high or low tax rates are or should be, nor is this about the size and scope of government. This is about how, for all intents and pur-poses, American corporations reject their citizenships in order to avoid complying with the law. 
For what it’s worth, Burger King denies its purchase of 
Tim Horton’s has anything to do with American taxes, but the purchase and move to Canada highlights the contin-ued disconnect between American citizens and American corporations.
What needs to happen now is a closing of the tax loop-
hole that allows for inversions, which would keep Ameri-can companies in the U.S. and force them to pay their fair share of taxes. Do that, and it’s likely that the corporate tax rate—a prime reason so many companies are leaving—will likely go down. 
It seems simple enough, and politically, you would 
think both Republicans and Democrats would agree. Just a few weeks ago, President Barack Obama called on Con-gress to end tax inversions, which means only one thing: partisan gridlock. Which means no solution. 
For now, companies are free to leave the U.S. if they 
wish, and all of us, regardless of our ideology and parti-sanship, will have one thing in common—we’ll continue getting screwed as a result.

Joseph Michaels
Senate President Pro-TemporeLetters to the Editor
Sexual assault is the hot top-
ic in the news lately, with more than 70 colleges under 
investigation for the handling of sexual assaults and a proposal for nail polish that detects date-rape drugs.
While it’s great that such an 
important topic is being brought to light, we’re focusing on the wrong thing.
Instead of making victims re-
sponsible for preventing assault or instead of handling assaults after the fact, let’s focus on the standard for responsible and con-
sensual sex.
Legal sex requires consent, ac-
cording to chapter 794.011 of the 
Florida State Statute. UF’s policy on sexual assault is in concur-
rence with state law: It’s sexual 
assault if you’re engaging in sex-ual activity without consent.
Consent can be a verbal “yes.” 
It can be nonverbal too, like en-thusiastic reciprocation of sexual touching.
The absence of a “no” does not 
equal consent. And, according to the UF Police Department, con-sent is not the “inability to make decisions due to intoxication by 
any substance.”
Here’s the thing: You can’t 
legally consent to sex if you are 
intoxicated above the legal limit. This makes sense—when you’re 
drunk, your faculties are lowered, 
and you’re more vulnerable.
Alcohol is actually the most 
common drug used in sexual as-
saults. According to GatorWell, 
more than 50 percent of sexual assaults involve alcohol use.
But we’re in college. We go to 
the No. 10 party school as ranked 
by The Princeton Review, so 
we’re constantly surrounded by alcohol.
Honestly, on any given night 
of the week—and sometimes days, too—there’s a solid chance 
that I’m not sober.
So how do you balance legal 
consent, which is absolutely nec-
essary for any sexual conduct, with your Midtown barhopping?
It would be hypocritical of me 
to tell you not to have sex when drunk. I’ve done it. I’ve enjoyed it, and I’ve been extremely aware 
of what I was doing and whom I 
was doing it with.
It would be naive for anyone 
to expect college students not to have drunk sex.
So instead, let’s have a crash 
course on safe, responsible, drunk sex.
This should go without say-
ing, but make sure the person is 
conscious.
He or she should be alert and 
should still be able to hold a con-
versation.
Don’t have sex if your partner 
is blacked out drunk and will not remember it later.
Make sure that your intended 
partner knows and recognizes 
you and is aware of his or her 
surroundings.
Avoid any sexual activity if 
they are slurring their words, if 
they can’t walk on their own, or 
if they don’t know where they are or what they are doing.
Don’t engage in any sexual 
acts that your partner has previ-
ously said “no” to.
While prior consent does not 
mean the person consents to sex-
ual activity later, you might want 
to soberly discuss what is on- and off-limits when you’re engaging 
in drunk sex, especially with a new partner.
If you’re ever unsure of wheth-
er to initiate sexual activity, don’t. If you think your partner might regret having sex when they so-
ber up, then don’t have sex.
Drunk sex can be fun, but only 
if all parties are still conscious in 
their decision to be having sex. If the presence of consent is ever 
questionable, it’s better to be safe 
than sorry and to put off sex for now.
And if you do decide that 
you’re too drunk to have safe and responsible sex, you can always wait until the next morning for some action, anyway. Morning sex is great, and getting enthu-
siastic, sober consent from your 
partner is even better.

UF received a grant that could help medi-
cal professionals save soldiers’ lives on the 
front lines.
UF and U.S. Army Research Laboratory 
Simulation and Training Technology Center 
researchers received a $1.75 million grant to 
develop portable medical simulators.
Instead of military medical personnel 
having reduced access to training when they are overseas, the training could follow them, said Dr. Samsun Lampotang, a professor of anesthesiology in the UF College of Medicine and the director of the UF Center for Safety, Simulation and Advanced Learning Tech-
nologies.
Lampotang’s team is working on five 
medical simulators to treat specific parts of the body. The simulators will be able to fit in 
a padded case that can easily be transported.
One simulator will allow medical profes-
sionals to practice helping soldiers with head injuries, while another will let medics give regional anesthesia to wounded soldiers.
The team used 3-D printing and human 
medical scans to make some of the models realistic, said Dave Lizdas, the simulation 
engineer.
Lizdas said making the simulators robust 
and sturdy was challenging.
“They get pretty beat up,” he said.
Military medics will begin training for the 
simulators in the next two years, Lampotang said.
“Eventually, if we show this is useful and 
really makes a difference in patient outcome, 
then it would probably be commercialized,” 
he said.Grant helps medical trainingcampus

Select time-crunched, vegetarian-
food-loving students and staff at UF 
Health Shands Hospital no longer have to travel far for their favorite meals.
Inspired by 30 loyal Krishna lunch 
fans, Krishna Lunch 2 Go will box and deliver their lunches to the Health Pro-fessions/Nursing/Pharmacy complex beginning Tuesday.
“It’s been something that so many 
people in the Shands area wanted,” said Caitanya Long, vice president of the Krishna House. “With a short period of time for lunch, they were still willing to trek here. They love the lunch so much.”
Lunches will be packed in biodegrad-
able carry-out containers and delivered by one of the Krishna workers to the pic-nic area between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m.
The Krishnas will not charge a deliv-
ery fee, but they are asking for a $5 dona-tion. 
With the idea of going green in mind, 
Gainesville Compost made a trailer for the Krishnas that attaches to a bicycle.
Cayman Talcott, who has been living 
at the Krishna House for two weeks, will deliver the food.
He said he looks forward to working 
outside.
“I’m really excited about it and hope 
other people are as excited as me,” Tal-cott said.
Krishna Lunch 2 Go is not meant as an 
expansion, Long said, but to take care of its dedicated customers.
“This is all happening by word-of-
mouth,” she said. “We’re doing this for our hardcore Krishna lunch fans.”Krishna to deliver to ShandsFRIDAY, AUGUST 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Read the story at alligatorSports.org� UF OPENS WITH THREE HOME GAMES.
MORGAN MORIARTY
Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
Following a 4-8 season, head 
coach Will Muschamp seemingly 
made all the right changes. He hired a new offensive coordinator in Kurt Roper, as well as offen-sive line coach Mike Summers to give the 2013 offense an up-tempo makeover.
Now that the Gators have 
a new offense and are ﬁ  nally healthy, several fans as well as media members are pegging Flor-ida to rebound and even contend 
for an SEC East title. There’s even 
a small faction that have them winning more than nine games and being a surprise candidate for a College Football Playoff bid, similar to Auburn’s unexpected 12-2 season last year.
But there’s one thing standing 
in Florida’s way that could hin-der them accomplishing all that with ease, and it’s something that 
simply is the nature of the beast 
of being the Florida Gators foot-ball program: the schedule. It’s a true gauntlet, so let’s go through and see what the Gators will have to navigate week to week for the 2014 season.
The ﬁ  rst three games for Flor-
ida should be a cakewalk. They open with Idaho, Eastern Michi-gan and Kentucky all at home — 
three teams with a combined 5-31 
record in 2013.

VOLLEYBALL
IAN COHEN
Alligator Writer @ibcohen5
If you were to walk in on a Florida vol-
leyball practice at the Gale Lemerand Gym, it 
wouldn’t look like one.
Florida’s current roster consisting of 17 play-
ers, which includes ﬁ  ve freshmen, is the deep-est it has been in years. As a result, practices are more akin to competitions, starters are becom-
ing increasingly replaceable and the freshmen 
aren’t just reserved as benchwarmers.
The No. 10 Gators’ depth of talent will be on 
full display when they host Georgia Southern, Idaho and Oklahoma this weekend in the Ac-tive Ankle Challenge tournament.
“The good thing about how Mary (Wise) 
has this whole system set up is, yes, you do 
have a starter, but you always have an oppor-
tunity to ﬁ  ght for a position,” junior Mackenzie Dagostino said. “Even though technically I am a starter right now, I will always be competing in the gym.”
As will defensive specialist Madison Mon-
serez.
“Within positions, the competition is so 
intense because of the depth,” the senior said. “But it’s also great because every position is helping each other grow, helping each other 
out.”
Lately, Wise and associate head coach Dave 
Boos have utilized a hands-off approach in 
practices by grouping players by positions and 
allowing them to coach each other.Florida prepares for Active Ankle ChallengeWell, Gator fans, it’s ﬁ  nally here.
Gameday.
The Idaho Vandals come to the 
Swamp for the 2014 season opener with the intent to sabotage the Gators’ quest to move on from a 4-8 season that you 
all more than likely want to forget.
And with the start of a new football 
season comes another round of the al-
ligatorSports Brand Picks Column, where picking against the spread is 
anything but a sure thing.
Debating the game of the week — 
No. 14 Wisconsin versus No. 13 LSU 
in Houston — are alligatorSports Edi-
tor Jordan McPherson and staff writer Jonathan Czupryn.
Wisconsin (-5) will play spoiler to 
LSU on Saturday because…
Wisconsin returns its top playmaker 
on offense in running back Melvin Gor-
don as well as four of its starters on the 
offensive line. The Badgers will have 
no problem running the ball down the 
throat of a Tigers defense that lost half 
its starters from 2013. Plus, if LSU was 
actually serious about winning football 
games, they’d pick a mascot that wasn’t already used by real teams like Clem-
son, Missouri and Savannah State.
-Jordan McPherson
LSU (+5) will rob Wisconsin of an 
opening day win because . . .
We all know the adage, “If you have 
two quarterbacks, you have none.” And, 
well, LSU has none. But who cares? Les “The Mad Hatter” Miles has brought on 
college football’s next godsend, it’s next 
savior and it’s next Adrian Peterson. 
Although he’s not even starting at run-
ning back (watch out Terrence Magee), 
freshman phenom Leonard Fournette 
will get some snaps against the Badgers 
and he will show the world that this 
hype is no joke. When your own coach

Now onto the picks!
Fresh on the Picks Column is al-
ligatorSports editor Jordan “Wait, I 
can drive now?” McPherson, who 
STILL hasn’t passed his driving test 
to earn his license. Hey Jordan? You know the alligatorSports crew is go-ing on five road trips this fall right? Nice try, but license or not, you’re 
getting behind the wheel so the rest 
of us can get some sleep. Ten and two man, ten and two.
Also making a Picks Column 
debut is Morgan “Is she qualified to do this?” Moriarty, who was ques-tioned on Twitter about her knowl-edge — or lack thereof — of college 
football. I know you’re doubting it 
now, Morgan, but everyone needs to come to terms with their down-falls at some point.
Replacing Bryan Holt as a guest 
picker from Insidethegators.com is Landon “Do you even lift bro” Wat-nick, who was specifically called out by the Gators’ Dante Fowler, Jr. The 6-foot-3, 260-pound Buck line-
backer said any one of the UF beat 
reporters would be killed going up against Florida’s offensive line, and then Fowler promptly turned and 
pointed to Landon saying, “Espe-
cially you.” C’mon dude, Southwest Rec isn’t that far away. It’s time to 
bulk up.
Another fresh face on the Picks 
Column is alligatorSports staff writ-
er Jonathan “Johnathan Cyprien” Czupryn, whose name so closely resembles that of the second-year Jacksonville Jaguars safety that AP 
writer Mark Long confuses the two 
on a daily basis.  “Zoop” has run its course — we’ve got a new nickname for you this year, bud. 
Beginning his second year on the 
beat but first on the Picks column is alligatorSports.org editor Richard “We strong then” Johnson, who ca-sually sauntered into the office with 
a Tupperware container chalk full 
of crab legs over the summer. Your boy Jameis Winston won a national title before earning the right to take his crab legs wherever he wanted. 
Sorry Richard, you haven’t quite made it to the point where you can 
crack shells and make a mess wher-ever you damn well please. Try a 
sandwich next time.
Heading into his third year with 
the Picks Column is the Orlando 
Sentinel’s Edgar “Don’t go into de-
tails” Thompson, who told Ahmad 
Fulwood that he probably wouldn’t understand it if the wide receiver ex-
plained some of the offense’s varia-
tions. It’s alright, Edgar. At least you’ve got your golf swing.Returning once again to the Picks 
Column is Thomas “Why am I doing 
this again?” Goldkamp of 247Sports.
com, who constantly steps up in the clutch by dividing, assigning and sending out the transcriptions dur-
ing media availability. No insult 
here, just keep up the good work. We all know how lazy sports report-
ers can be so thanks for making our 
jobs a little easier. 
And finally, we have first-time picks columnist Nick “Never bet against the ‘OR’” de la Torre, who confidently bet Richard Johnson a 4 
Rivers dinner platter that the word 
“or” would appear fewer than 5.5 times on Florida’s depth chart. Nick, we hope Gator Country gave you a 
bonus this year because Richard isn’t 
going to go light on the barbequed meats. Who would have thought a 
position battle at kicker, punter and 
punt returner would have cost you so dearly? Eat up Richard!

@LagunaLawrence 
After playing in the comfort of home to 
open the season, the No. 6 Gators will take on 
a challenge they haven’t faced since 2012.
When Florida (2-0) matches up against 
Oklahoma (1-0-1) tonight at 8 for the first of 
two games over the weekend, it will com-
mence a six-game road trip.
The last time the Gators had an extensive 
road stretch in the beginning of their schedule was in 2011 when the team started the season with four matches away from UF. 
After opening the season 
with two home wins, Flori-
da won’t play in Gainesville 
until Sept. 26 when it faces Georgia.
“It is a challenge not to 
play at home,” midfielder 
Havana Solaun said. “At the same time it brings a little bit of excitement that makes us still play just as hard.”Florida defeated Oklahoma at home with 
ease having a trio of players finding the back of the net for a 3-0 victory.The Sooners were 2-2 heading into that match, but this time around they come in with only a victory and a draw 
against two unranked opponents.
Oklahoma may come in to the match hav-
ing played lower ranked opponents to begin 
their season, but they now have to face a top-10 opponent in Florida that is looking to cor-rect some of the defensive problems that ap-peared in the opening weekend.
“Every game gives us an opportunity to grow,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “We have to do some things a little bit better organiza-tionally defensively and in terms of offensive-ly, being a little more efficient because we are getting in good positions but we need scoring 
opportunities to come out of those. The game 
is a great teacher.”
Florida enters the weekend with two shut-
out victories, while Oklahoma had an easy vic-tory over Oklahoma State, but struggled with a double overtime draw against Utah.

LW ‘Bama Wisc. IdahoBut then the gut-check por-
tion of the schedule begins 
in Week 4 with a road trip to Tuscaloosa, Ala., to take on the Crimson Tide. Alabama enters 
2014 as the SEC Title favorite, 
as well as a playoff favorite. Sure, they don’t have their quarterback situation nailed down at this point, but with Derrick Henry, Kenyan Drake and T.J. Yeldon in the back-ﬁ  eld who needs a quarterback? Defensively they return only 
three starters from last year, 
but as long as Saban is at the helm with defensive coordina-tor Kirby Smart, the unit is in good hands. PS: The last time Alabama lost at home was two years ago against Texas A&M.
The Gators get a bye week 
before a pretty tough three-
game stretch. It gets started 
with a road trip to Knoxville, Tenn., to take on Tennessee. Florida hasn’t lost to the Vols since 2004, but don’t sleep on the Volunteers in Neyland Stadium. Last season they up-set South Carolina at home and forced Georgia into over-
time. If Florida heads into this 
matchup overconﬁ  dent, Ten-nessee has the potential to ﬂ  ip the script on the recently lop-sided rivalry.
Next, Florida gets a home 
date with LSU. This game has the potential to be one of the most exciting of Florida’s 
games, simply because of the 
signiﬁ  cance of the rivalry. The Tigers enter with a new quarterback, but four return-ing starting offensive linemen and a talented tailback duo in Terrence Magee and Leonard Fournette. They have some new faces on the defensive line, but return defensive backs Jalen Mills and Tre’Davious White. A signature win against the Tigers just might be a vic-tory that keeps Muschamp in Gainesville after this season.
The following week they get 
Missouri at home. This game being in the Swamp might just be the difference maker. The Ti-gers have to replace explosive 
defensive linemen in Michael 
Sam and Kony Ealy, and on offense they replace longtime quarterback James Franklin with sophomore Maty Mauk. Gator fans know that name well, as Mauk led the Tigers to a 36-17 victory over Florida in Columbia, Mo., last season. 
Mauk is without lethal wideout 
Dorial Green-Beckham in 2014 however. Depending on how the rest of the SEC East stands, this game could be pivotal on who makes it to Atlanta.
Florida gets a bye week be-
fore arguably the biggest game 
of the season, both for the 
Gators and for head coach Will Muschamp.
Florida-Georgia. The game 
that Muschamp hasn’t been able to win as either a head coach or a player when he was at Georgia. 
It’s no easy task even with-
out quarterback Aaron Mur-ray with the ‘Dawgs, as ex-plosive tailbacks Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall remain in Georgia’s backﬁ  eld. This game is another matchup that could make or break a ﬁ  fth year for 
Muschamp in Gainesville.
Florida travels to Vander-
bilt this year, but I don’t see the 
Commodores pulling off an upset like last season’s. With no James Franklin in Nashville, Florida has the upper hand.

FSU on the road By observing and critiquing their 
teammates, many players agree that 
the team’s overall volleyball IQ has 
skyrocketed.
“I think in the past the effort 
has always been there, but the IQ is 
the thing we’ve really raised to the 
next level,” Monserez said.  “When 
you’re teaching people and you’re helping others, you’re actually help-ing yourself by saying ‘oh that’s kind of how I do that.’ The coaches 
have embraced it and we’re doing a 
really great job applying it.”
With ﬁ  ve incoming freshmen, a 
lack of volleyball knowledge and 
playing experience was an early 
concern with this year’s group.
Additionally, Florida was dealt a 
signiﬁ  cant blow after losing senior Chloe Mann, the NCAA’s all-time leader in hitting percentage.
But the middle blocker position 
will hardly suffer.
Blocker Simone Antwi, as well 
as 6-foot-4 freshman Rhamat Alhas-san and sophomore Shainah Joseph 
will look to ﬁ  ll the position.
“We really like where Simone’s 
game is now… Shainah had as good 
a spring in terms of development as 
any player I can remember. And 
then with Rhamat, coming off her terriﬁ  c summer performance with the USA junior national team,” Wise said. “It would be unfair to 
ask them to pick up exactly where 
Chloe left off offensively, but there are signs that what they are doing now is further ahead of what Chloe 
was doing at this time.”
This is especially true of Alhas-
san, who recorded a 36-foot-8 ver-
tical and can be frequently seen leaping chest-high above the net in practice.
“She’s still ﬁ  guring it out,” Wise 
said of Rhamat. “But its only a mat-ter of time. My guess is there will be a lot of students who will be able to say with great enthusiasm that they 
were in school when Rhamat was 
here.”
Florida will play its ﬁ  rst match 
against Georgia Southern at 12 
p.m., followed by a 7:30 p.m. match 
against Idaho. The Gators wrap up their season opening tournament on Saturday with a 2:30 p.m. matchup against Oklahoma.
“I think were just really excited 
to use everything that we’ve learned in pre season and kind of apply it,” Monserez said. 
“We’ve been playing against 
ourselves a lot in scrimmages and I think were all really excited to put all that we’ve learned to use in front of a real live team.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, AUGUST 29, 2014

Jeff Driskel started Florida’s second drive 
against Tennessee on a hot streak.
After passing for a career-high 291 yards 
in UF’s 21-16 loss to Miami two weeks ear-
lier, the junior quarterback picked up right where he left off against the Hurricanes.
Driskel completed three of his four pass-
es for 33 yards, marching the Gators down the field.
Then, on third-and-3 from the Tennessee 
41-yard line with 9:39 remaining in the first quarter, Driskel dropped back to pass.
Tennessee defensive lineman Marlon 
Walls wrapped up Driskel and launched him to the ground after he attempted the pass, which was intercepted by Volunteers 
defensive back Devaun Swafford and re-
turned 62 yards for the first touchdown of the game. 
As Swafford and the rest of the Tennes-
see team were in the endzone celebrating 
the touchdown, Florida fans had their eyes 
focused near midfield — where their up-and-coming quarterback was on his knees in pain.
His right fibula was fractured, his season 
over before the calendar hit October.
The hit caused Driskel to join linebacker 
Matt Rolin, wide receiver Andre Debose and offensive lineman Chaz Green on the list of 
players who would not play football for the 
rest of the season — a list that climbed to 12 players by the end of 2013.
“I hurt for him, and I hurt for us right 
now,” coach Will Muschamp said after the 31-17 victory, one of the rare winning sights the Gators saw as they limped to a 4-8 re-cord.
“It’s going to hurt us. He’s a guy that’s 
won a lot of ballgames here, and it’s disap-pointing for him right now.”
It’s been a little more than 11 months 
since that day. 
And with Florida’s 2014 season opener 
against Idaho on Saturday at 7 p.m., Driskel 
is ready to take the helm of the Gators’ of-
fense at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium once again.
“That’s in the past. I’m good to go now,” 
Driskel said. “Not thinking about it, just 
getting back out there with the guys is what 
I’m looking forward to most.”
“But there’s nothing really like Game 1. 
It’s a really good feeling coming out of the 
tunnel.”
■     ■     ■
Driskel’s third season ended with a pick-
six and a broken leg.
But since training camp began this sum-
mer, his leg has healed and his only comple-
tions have been to the offense.
“He’s making better decisions with the 
ball and is more smart with it,” senior de-
fensive back Jabari Gorman said. “He’s see-
ing guys who are already open and making good decisions.”
Better ball protection will be key for 
Driskel if Florida hopes to have a successful 
2014 campaign. 
The Gators finished last season with a -2 
turnover ratio, a 17-point downturn from 
their +15 margin in 2012 that tied for sev-
enth in the nation.
“We haven’t been explosive enough of-
fensively to overcome turnovers, and I 
think we will be this year,” Muschamp said at UF’s media day on Aug. 3. “Certainly not 
saying it’s OK to turn the ball over. We’ve 
got to take care of the ball. That’s the num-ber one thing as far as our team goals are concerned.”
■     ■     ■
2013 was supposed to be Driskel’s break-out season.
He may have registered 10 wins in his 
first year as the team’s signal caller in 2012 — he sat out Florida’s 23-0 rout of Jackson-ville State with a sprained right ankle — but his pure numbers were paltry.
His 1,646 passing yards ranked 11th in 
the Southeastern Conference and 99th in the nation. 
His 6.7 yards per pass attempt were tied 
for 11th and 80th in those categories. 
His 12 touchdown passes tied for 10th 
and 90th, respectively.
Through his lone two complete games of 
the 2013 season, Driskel showed promise, 
averaging 222 passing yards per game — 
the most from a UF quarterback since Tim Tebow averaged 252.8 yards through the air per contest during the 2007 season.
But because of his injury, everyone is 
left to ponder what could have happened if Driskel lasted the entirety of the season.
Would his numbers have remained 
steady?Would he crash and burn as the SEC slate 
intensified?
Would he grind through the adversity 
and turn doubters into believers?
Those questions are still lingering, and 
they’ll continue to linger until Driskel either 
puts up or shuts up.
“I think that we never really, as a fan 
base, got to enjoy the progress that was 
made from year two to year three, last year,” 
Muschamp said, “but I see much more com-
mand, comfort level.”
■     ■     ■
Florida’s aerial attack has been stagnant 
since Muschamp took the helm in 2011.
In Muschamp’s first three seasons, the 
Gators never finished better than 104th in total offense.
Two offensive coordinators in Charlie 
Weis and Brent Pease have come and gone.
Maybe the third will be the charm with 
Kurt Roper.
Roper, Duke’s offensive coordinator from 
2008-2013, knows how to bring the tempo to 
an offense.
In Roper’s final five years with the Blue 
Devils, Duke finished no worse than 50th in 
passing offense.
UF players notice the difference.“He’s going hard every play. He’s like a 
player out there,” said wide receiver Valdez Showers. 
“He loves the game. He’s always got en-
ergy. There’s not one day where he comes out there down. You feed off his energy. He’s always up-tempo, so you want to be up-tempo. That’s the way the offense 
goes.”
And after eight months to learn Roper’s 
spread offense — a shotgun-heavy, quick-
paced system — Driskel is looking not just like a new quarterback, but also a new play-
er.
“I understand what we’re doing really 
well,” Driskel said. 
“Schematically, where we want to go 
with the ball in certain situations. When we 
want to do run checks. When you start to do that you can focus on the defense as well. ... All the time I’ve put in is really starting to pay off. The game has really slowed down 
a lot.”
Added Showers: “I feel like this offense 
fits him more.  … He’s definitely made some 
strides in getting more of a feel for the game 
and not being as robotic in going through 
his reads.”
And although Roper wants to unleash 
Driskel and let him run free, the first-year UF coordinator doesn’t want a repeat of last 
season.
“It’s always the debate,” Roper said. 
“It’s an interesting discussion that we’re having all the time as the staff. The num-
ber one thing is winning a football game 
and trying to find the way to win a football game. Jeff does give us the ability with his feet to add to the run game and cause de-fenses more issues. You definitely want to 
use that, but at the same time you want to 
be smart. 
“He doesn’t need to take any unneces-
sary hits.”
Although Driskel has to step up and 
move away from a game-manager role, he won’t have to carry the offense on his own.
The Gators have a three-headed monster 
in the backfield composed of running backs 
Matt Jones, Kelvin Taylor and Mack Brown.
The wide receiver corps is talented 
enough that Roper believes he can rotate up 
to eight players and see similar production 
totals from each.
Redshirt senior Jake McGee — a transfer 
from Virginia — gives UF a viable pass-
catching tight end for the first time since Jordan Reed left for the NFL Draft following 
the 2012 season.
The offensive line, which saw seven dif-
ferent alignments throughout the 2013 sea-
son due to injury, is fully healthy.
“Players are a reflection of their coach,” 
Muschamp said. “Kurt is a very upbeat, 
positive guy. He’s got a little edge about 
him. ... But again, it starts with talent, and I 
think we’re more talented than we’ve been. But Kurt’s got an edge about him that I re-ally like.”
■     ■     ■
Saturday can’t come soon enough for 
Florida.
It’s the opportunity to start anew, and 
until the Gators snap the seven-game losing 
streak they carry over from 2013, the memo-
ries of that season will still arise.
“Nobody wants to be 4-8,” Dunbar said. 
“We think about it. We bring it up at times 
because we still got that sour taste in our mouths from last year. We feel like we’re 
going to get revenge.”
But no opponent can be taken for grant-
ed.
Not even an Idaho team that went 1-11 
last season and saw opponents average 46.8 
points per game against them.
“We had four wins last year,” redshirt 
senior middle linebacker Mike Taylor said,” so you know that’s just the difference be-
tween the years. ... They want to turn their 
season around just like we do as well. We can’t take any opponent likely, especially coming in here.”
The Gators are ready to leave the past in 
the past, and Muschamp has just one thing to say:
“Just shut up and go play.”KICKOFF

Two trainers tend to quarterback Jeff Driskel after he suffered a fractured right fibula during Florida’s 31-17 victory against 
Tennessee on Sept. 21 in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. The injury sidelined Driskel for the final nine games of the 2013 season — a season in which the quarterback was poised to see an increase in production.

RedemptionReady forMy ignorance is my fault, but I don’t 
think the point was really driven home about how disconnected the 
Florida football program had gotten from its fans until Wednesday. 
Yes I see the bleachers get emptier and 
emptier in the Swamp every year — I chalk 
that up personally to there just being more ap-
athy among college football fans in general. 
I have always kind of shrugged off the no-
tion of “disconnected from the fanbase” as not a core issue, or not an issue that impacted too 
many people. 
I’m from Gainesville, where everyone has 
some connection to the University of Florida, 
and my family wouldn’t be here if my mother 
hadn’t been hired by Shands.
Wednesday, I tweeted out a picture of what 
I thought was a pretty simple move by the 
Florida marketing department, putting center Max Garcia and linebacker Mike Taylor in the 
ticket booth to hand out tickets to students. 
It got some retweets and some favorites, 
nothing out of the norm, but I was surprised 
by how poignant the gesture connected with 
one of my followers. 
About the gesture, @nawtadigm tweeted 
“I love the connection. It sucks to feel discon-
nected from the program.”
To unpack the idea of the disconnect, let 
me ﬁ  rst examine what I think connects folks to their respective programs.
When someone says “your (insert college 
team) sucks” they aren’t just saying the 11 
men on the ﬁ  eld suck. 
They’re coming at your way of life. As-
suming you’re an alum of UF, the best four 
years of your life were spent in Gainesville. Sometimes your father, or your father’s father 
spent his here too. 
Perhaps you met your spouse on campus 
or maybe friends that last a lifetime.
If you aren’t an alum, you still have a con-
nection. You wear orange and blue on Sat-
urdays and get upset when people say Tim Tebow can’t play quarterback in the NFL. You follow recruiting incessantly, and bring your kids to 
the spring game. 
For fans of every 
school, that passion 
runs deep, and it’s 
important — like, 
tell your friends not 
to schedule a damn wedding between August and January important. But let’s be honest, anyone that would have a fall wedding isn’t a 
friend of yours to begin with.
So how does that ingrained loyalty erode 
over time? It starts with the fact that from the 
jump, college athletics isn’t as mom and pop 
as it used to be. College athletics is big busi-
ness and we all know it. 
Revenue-producing coaches make mil-
lions, athletic directors make millions and television contracts line everyone’s pockets — except the players of course.
It’s just not the way things used to be, and 
that’s ﬁ  ne. Everything changes over time. 
Florida stood signiﬁ  cantly behind the 
curve with many schools on improving the fan experience in the stadium. Things like 
getting wiﬁ   and game look-ins from across 
the country and more stats on video boards — that stuff matters and UF is ﬁ  nally getting those things done. 
There’s also the fact the team didn’t do so 
hot, but I think that’s an ancillary reason, after being just six years removed from a national championship and two years removed from a BCS bowl and the doorstep of another title 
game berth.
Couple that with the alarming connection 
that isn’t being built with current students. As 
of Sunday evening, Florida was 1,500 tickets short of their student season ticket allotment number, at risk of not selling out for the ﬁ  rst time since 1979. 
The fact of the matter is students just feel 
they have better things to do than go to games, especially when a team is losing noon games and the games aren’t that good. 
Then those students graduate and become 
boosters with disposable income that have better uses for that money than to just end-lessly pump it back to Gainesville.
So how do you ﬁ  x the disconnect? The sim-
ple answers are “just win” and “improve the quality of opponents” which are both things that will happen. 
Just like Florida State, a team in this part of 
the country with the resources and cache that Florida has will not stay down for decades on end. But there is more to it than that, and Florida’s doing it. 
The fan advisory council, open practices to 
fans and things like football players handing out tickets are just a few things the school is doing right now.
The more I think about it, fan apathy and 
disconnect is here to stay. 
Stadiums should be done expanding. The movement should be made to down-
size, more luxury suites and less cheap seats that aren’t being ﬁ  lled everywhere. 
As of Wednesday, Nebraska had tick-
ets available for ﬁ  ve home games, and it has sold out Memorial Stadium over 330 straight times.
Maybe those things I wrote about above 
aren’t just things the schools have done wrong, maybe they’re also excuses. 
I have a feeling fans say those things par-
tially because it prevents them from looking 
in the mirror and coming to grips with the 
fact that their personal fandom of old just isn’t there anymore. 
You gripe about change until you get 
used to it. Maybe disconnect isn’t the right word anymore — maybe it’s just a sign of the times.3, KICKOFF, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, AUGUST 29, 2014
