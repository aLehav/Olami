Dottie DeBruhl sat with her 
walker at her side, carefully 
smoothing the edges of a color-ful tapestry featuring Cinderel-la- and strawberry-print fabrics and an American ﬂ  ag.
DeBruhl, 84, laced thread 
through the quilt’s layers and tied it to hold the blanket to-gether.
She said she can’t see well 
enough to sew, but she knows she is making a difference.
“People get to stay a little 
warmer because of us,” she said.
The members of Trinity Met-
ropolitan Community Church of Gainesville have been sew-ing all year long, assembling quilts to distribute to Gaines-ville’s homeless in the cool win-ter months.
They will go through-
out town in November to Bo Diddley Community Plaza and other areas to distribute their handiwork.
On Tuesday , a group met to ﬁ  nish the season’s last batch of blankets.
Quilting group co-founder 
Barbara Petersen, 69, said she expects to have about 60 quilts ready to give away . When the group started three years ago, it made 30.
All of the quilts are made by 
volunteers with donated items, she said.
“I’m not a ﬁ  ne quilter, but 
I love this project,” Petersen said.
The Rev . Jim Merritt, pastor 
of the church, said the club’s meetings are styled after old-fashioned quilting bees.
He said the meetings re-
mind him of the socials he at-tended with his grandmother, at which people gathered their chairs into a circle to sew and socialize.
“It’s very typical of Southern 
culture,” Merritt said.
Merritt said the group of 
10 to 15 active members meets faithfully about every month.
Petersen said each quilt con-
sists of a large piece of fabric, such as a bed sheet,  for back-ing, a layer of an old blanket for insulation and a top patchwork layer.Church warms hearts by making quilts for the homeless

Monica Petrella scooped up the dark 
earth and stuck some carrot seeds in the 
small hole.
The 21-year-old UF food and resource 
economics junior said she hopes to study sustainable food systems, and community gardening is one way to start that path.
“I love giving back to Gainesville since 
I’m from here,” Petrella said.
Broccoli, onions and carrots are just a few 
of the winter crops that will be ready to har-vest from the Downtown Farmers Garden in a few months after a Fall Planting Event Tuesday evening celebrating World Food Day.
The Alachua County Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainabil-
ity, Florida Organic Growers and Citizen’s Co-op were some of the local organizations that collaborated for the event. 
About 20 volunteers planted seeds, 
seedling vegetables and seedling spices in ﬁ  ve planting beds. Fall and spring planting events are hosted each year.
Florida Organic Growers community food 
project coordinator Travis Mitchell mapped out the raised gardening beds for the volun-teers and gave them packets of seeds.

No, the Gator football season isn’t 
coloring your vision: Trees on UF’s 
campus are actually becoming blue.
Australian artist Konstantin Dimo-
poulos is painting them as part of a project to raise environmental aware-ness about deforestation. 
He will work on campus all week 
and will appear at a public welcome ceremony at noon on the Reitz Union Colonnade. Attendees will have the opportunity to ask Dimopoulos ques-tions about his work, which aims to spark conversation.
“We have to start somewhere to 
get the message across,” he said. “One person can make a difference, but you need other people to spread the mes-sage.”
Volunteer Laura Arango, a 19-year-
old telecommunication sophomore, said people frequently come up to her to ask what she’s doing.
“A lot of people are concerned that 
the paint might damage the trees. But after I explain to them what we are doing, they think it’s pretty neat,” Ar-ango said.
Dimopoulos uses pigment and wa-
ter to create the special paint that does not harm trees. The paint naturally comes off in about six months due to weather.
The $22,000 used to cover the instal-
lation cost, supplies and rented equip-ment was privately funded through the UF Foundation, said university spokesman Steve Orlando.  Blue trees arrive on campus

� REDROCK BOARD SHOP IS 
HOUSED IN KING’S GARAGE.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Aaron King longboards 
through Gainesville, many people 
don’t realize he’s riding an electric board.
He stops his board in a split 
second, then cruises away with the touch of a button.
King, 28, is the founder of Re-
dRock Board Shop, a Gainesville company that produces customiz-able electric longboards. The shop offers various boards, wheels, colors, batteries and a USB plug that lets riders program acceleration, brake intensity and longboard speed with their computers.
The motorized truck — a metal 
piece that connects wheels to the deck — costs $300. The electronics and truck can be purchased and at-tached to an existing board for $950. An all inclusive package — board and electronics — costs $1,188.
King, who graduated from UF 
in 2007 with an engineering degree, began longboarding in 2002 to get around campus. He started buy-ing equipment and making electric boards as a side job five years ago when he found electric longboards weren’t as high-quality as he ex-pected.
“I know what the longboard feel 
is supposed to feel like,” King said. “I wanted to get that electric feel.”
King began RedRock Board 
Shop in May after his longboards started getting attention among his friends. He quit his job at LoadTest Inc. and began making boards full time out of his garage in downtown Gainesville.
But now, the startup costs keep 
King and his shop from full produc-tion. King took to the Web and es-tablished a Kickstarter page for his company to raise money for produc-tion runs and legal fees due to liabil-ity costs.
His goal is to raise $99,999 by 
Oct. 28. As of Tuesday, the drive has raised $4,480.
“We need to get our a-- kicked 
a little bit,” King said. “Once it’s in gear, it’ll pretty much pay for it-self.”
King said there are a handful 
of other competitors that produce electric skateboards, but most of the longboards he’s seen are poor qual-ity and overpriced.
King said longboard enthusiasts 
ranging from 9 to 60 years old have used his boards, and high school and college students use them to get around campus.
His interest in his electric long-
boards has gone coast to coast since he went to California in August for a trade show. He is talking to distribu-tors and, ultimately, wants his prod-uct to be available in skate shops.
“There’s a new breed of electric 
boards that aren’t toys and aren’t junk,” King said.Most of the parts are made in 
Connecticut, with the exception of the motor, which is made in China. Depending on the order, assembly takes five minutes to an hour.
So far, King has made 15 electric 
longboards and has sold about 10.
Peter Harter, manager of Free 
Ride Surf & Skate Shop, said the store doesn’t plan to carry electric longboards because of the high price and because it’s a new market.
Nonetheless, Harter said a cus-
tom electric skateboard is an excel-lent idea because the board has a braking system, which would mean they’d be allowed in bike lanes rath-er than only on sidewalks.
“It’s a form of exercise [rather] 
than a form of entertainment,” Har -
ter said.
Gator Longboarding president 
Jeffrey Dickens, 19, said he wouldn’t use an electric skateboard as his pri-mary source of transportation, but he’d try it out as a toy.
“They’re a lot of fun to mess 
around on,” the mechanical engi-neering sophomore said.
He said the ability to customize 
your own longboard is a good step, but because of the price, only seri-ous longboarders would invest in an electric board.
“If it’s your hobby ,” Dickens said, 
“people will spend.”
King plans to produce about 100 
boards a month once his business gets rolling.
“We just need the beginning in-
ventory, and we’re good to go.”

The Alachua County Fair returns Friday to 
kick off a week of festivities.
The fair starts at 5 p.m. Friday at the Ala-
chua County Fairgrounds, 3100 NE 39th Ave., 
with a concert and will run through Oct. 27.
Stephen White, CEO of Event Marketing 
Corporation, said he expects about 35,000 people to attend.
“It all depends on the weather,” said White, whose company is managing the fair.
This will be the fair’s second year under 
new management since it faced cancellation in 2010 for unpaid bills.
“All bills were paid in full by last year’s 
fair,” White said. “We still made a small profit last year.”
This year’s fair will have new attractions, 
including The Grizzly Experience Show as well as new, local performers appearing throughout the week.White said Kachunga and the Alligator 
Show is “back by popular demand,” and the Talent Quest Karaoke Singing Contest will hold its prequalifications at the fair Tuesday.It will also hold the Sunburst Beauty Pageant Saturday.
Tickets are $5 for adults, $2 for kids ages 6 to 12 and $20 for wristbands that allow unlim-ited rides.
“If you want to get more bang for your 
buck, buy a wristband in advance, and come on a Wednesday and there will be no lines,” White said.
Daniel Jennette, 20-year-old UF marketing 
sophomore, plans to attend next week.
“I’ve gone to a lot of state and county fairs 
in the past,” he said. “I’d like to see what Ala-chua’s has to offer.” County fair returns to town this weekend with new attractions
“I’ve gone to a lot of state and

Daniel Jennette
marketing sophomorePetersen said they put the quilts in hand-
made cloth bags and toss toiletries inside.
“When we get them done each year, we 
spread them out all over the church, and 
Rev . Jim blesses them,” Petersen said. “We send them out with that.”
Merritt said the most memorable quilt 
recipient appeared two years ago on Bo Diddley Plaza. He said a volunteer handed a quilt to a woman in her 80s. She thanked him but declined the gift.
“‘I don’t really need it,’” Merritt recalled 
the woman said. “‘Is it OK if I give it to that lady over there? Because she really does need it.’”
Merritt said she then stood up, walked 
over to the other homeless woman and gave it to her.
“It’s the best of it — when you give in a 
way that enables others to give when they otherwise couldn’t have done so,” Merritt said.KATHRYN VARN

The number of homeless people 
in Gainesville rose to 2,094 this year.
To combat this number, the 
Gainesville/Alachua County Office 
of Homelessness will raise money through grants and organize com-munity events to increase aware-ness, said Theresa Lowe, office di-rector. 
The office received awards, orga-
nized events and drafted plans for a Gainesville homeless marketplace, according to a quarterly report re-leased by the office Monday.
The office received two Alachua 
County Community Agency Part-nership Program awards, Lowe said. One worth $23,000 will go to-ward move-in expenses, the report said. The other, worth $2,000, will stock the pantries of people when they move into permanent housing.
The organization also applied 
for a TD Bank grant worth $100,000. The money will fund the Max Wells Veterans Transitional Housing Fa-cility Project, which will provide transitional housing for 114 home-less veterans, the report said.
The 14th Annual Breakfast on 
the Plaza, sponsored by the Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry , will be Oct. 25 to teach residents about services available to homeless people.
There will be breakfast for about 
600 people made by volunteers from Bread of the Mighty , a Gainesville food pantry , Lowe said. There will also be 35 homeless service pro-viders, like Meridian Behavioral Healthcare and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
“It’s a really good way for people 
to connect to different services,” Lowe said, “ideally to get them into jobs and off the street.”
The report also had a letter to the 
Gainesville City Commission re-garding the GRACE Marketplace, a homeless assistance center that will consolidate services in one place.
The marketplace, which will offer 
housing, food, medical and behav-ioral health services and job train-ing, is not intended to be a homeless shelter, Lowe said.
“We’re really trying to bring the 
concept of a marketplace but target-ed toward those who are homeless or facing homelessness,” Lowe said.
Lowe’s office looked to similar 
facilities across the country as mod-els for the marketplace, she said.
She hopes it will allow Gaines-
ville’s existing homeless service pro-viders to work together, she said.
Kent Vann, executive director of the St. Francis House, said that in this economy , there are fewer people in the community to help and more people on the streets.Because of this, he is optimistic 
about how the marketplace will help the community.
“Certainly one agency can’t serve everyone,” he said. “Any time you can provide more services to the community, that’s probably a better thing.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2012

In 2011, volunteers spent about 200

“It’s a good example of how trash can 
be turned into treasure,” Cano said.
When the harvest is ripe around De-cember, the food will be donated to Cath-olic Worker House and the St. Francis House. 
Last year, $1,000 worth of produce was 
donated to Sisters Helping Sisters and St. Francis House.
“It’s just one cog for greater food se-

Graduates struggling in the rough 
economy will be able to jump-start 
their job searches at a career fair Wednesday.
Career 180 will be from 10 a.m. to 2

Career 180 aims to connect people 
looking to get back into the job market with resources to help them find a job, said Travis Wright, project manager of Career 180. The event takes place every semester and is free and open to the public.
Employers won’t hire at the career 
fair, she said.
“Our main goal is to find needs in 
the community and address them,” Wright said.
For the first time, Career 180 will 
feature speakers. Joe Johnson, director of business service at Florida Works, and Stephen Wycoff, owner and busi-ness developer manager of Remedy Intelligent Staffing Agency, will speak at the event.
About seven tables will be set up 
at Career 180, including Wells Fargo, Dress for Success, Displaced Home-makers Program and an information table for legal services. A room will be set aside for resume critiques and mock interviews.
“The more people that are em-
ployed in the community, the better off it’ll be as a whole,” Wright said.Graduate career fair today

“Don’t ask, don’t tell” was not the policy fol-
lowed Tuesday night at UF Hillel.
About 70 students gathered as part of Pride 
Student Union’s Pride History Week to hear 
about Captain Jill Guttman’s experience as a lesbian in the U.S. Armed Forces. She served be-fore and after the “don’t ask, don’t tell” military policy was implemented.
When she first joined the Army , several rules 
implied “being homosexual was not conducive to military life.” She was prepped by a recruiter to lie about her orientation.
But Guttman said she sought refuge with fel-
low gay soldiers.
“We found each other. I don’t know how, 
but we did,” she told the crowd. 
Guttman left the Army in 1990, because hid-
ing her personal life was becoming too tiring, she said, and she rejoined after “don’t ask, don’t tell” took effect.
This time, Guttman pretended she was mar -
ried to a man, because the policy prohibited her from publicly addressing her orientation, she said. Guttman left the military in 2007.
Although the policy is eliminated, work 
needs to be done. Activists have the power to continue changing the situation, she said.
Dylen Montero, an 18-year-old biomedical 
engineering freshman, said Guttman’s story was interesting.
“I’m happy that there are people before me 
that have been through so much so that I can have opportunities,” he said.Military captain discusses DADT

Michelle Dunlap has a soft spot for 
what many people consider vicious, ugly 
killers.
Dunlap, director and founder of Phoe-
nix Animal Rescue, has found homes for abandoned and abused pit bulls since 2003.
“Pit bulls are like every other dog,” 
Dunlap said. “They have their own gifts, and that’s what you focus on.”
Phoenix Animal Rescue, which is a vol-
unteer-run nonprofit organization, doesn’t have a storefront.
The dogs are up for adoption at PetS-
mart, 3736 SW Archer Road, on Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The dogs live with dog-lovers who are 
willing to take care of them until they’re healthy enough to go into a permanent home.
Dunlap’s love for pit bulls began with a 
dog named Chance. 
She adopted Chance, a white pit bull 
with brown eyes, in 1999. She mistakenly thought he was a white boxer, but friends told her the dog was a pit bull. She said she thought to herself “God no, I would never have a pit bull.”
Chance was the dorkiest, silliest dog, 
she said. He wouldn’t hurt anyone.When Dunlap took Chance to training 
classes, she realized her dog was treated differently because of his breed.
She said she was frustrated with how 
other people looked at pit bulls.Animal rescues often turn away pit 
bulls because they think they won’t be able to get the dogs adopted, she said.
Chance died from a tick bite when he 
was 6 years old. 
His death didn’t stop Dunlap’s mission, 
but fueled it instead.
Dunlap is very selective about who gets 
the dogs. She knows people look for a per -
fect match.
“No one ever walks in and just takes 
the dog home,” said Jon Josephson, 28, a Santa Fe radiography student and a Phoe-nix Animal Rescue volunteer.
There are about 20 to 25 dogs in the res-
cue, and almost every dog is a pit bull.
She said people adopt six to eight dogs 
each month, and about 150 dogs are ad-opted every year.
The adoption fee is $150 to $200, and 
the owner gets free visits to a veterinarian in the first week.
Josephson said the adoption fee goes 
straight to the veterinarian bills and expenses that it took to keep the dog healthy.
The veterinarian bill is about $1,200 a 
month, Dunlap said.
She said she can’t imagine giving up the

Fake photo ops deceive
We hate entitlement.
It’s an icky behavior or mentality that has oozed its 
way from college cliques into mainstream society.
It’s beyond us at this point. Part of the all-encompassing na-
ture of entitlement stems from the multitude of social network-
ing sites at our ﬁ  ngertips. Dozens of websites want to know what we have to say . 
That’s why we think people everywhere should have to see 
and hear them, too. This happens so often, in fact, that celebrities or politicians stage the opportunities.
Everything we are presented by a political party has, ideally, 
gone through a process of public relations experts; everything is for a reason and a purpose. Except when it becomes more fake than usual.
Paul Ryan, the star vice presidential nominee, was recently 
seen in some interesting pictures. No, not the ones from his “beefcake photo shoot” that TIME Magazine shot.
“After greeting and thanking a handful of volunteers from St. 
Michael’s Catholic Church in Canﬁ  eld, Ohio, — who said they typically visit the St. Vincent DePaul Society every Saturday and serve food from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. — Ryan, his wife and their young children headed to the kitchen, donned white aprons and offered to clean up some dishes,” according to a Washington Post article.
It continued: “Ryan stood at the sink and took some large 
metal pans that did not appear to be dirty, soaped them up and rinsed them.”
He picked up clean dishes and then pretended to clean them 
some more while attempting to appear human.
In a Hufﬁ  ngton Post article, Michael Shaw wrote that he can 
“imagine people looking at this story and just waving a hand, saying this kind of pretend happens every day.” He also said that it is not always so obviously thrust into our faces — that most politicians at least try to hide the fact that what they’re do-ing is for positive publicity.
Still have doubts that it was staged?“We’re a faith-based organization; we are apolitical because 
the majority of our funding is from private donations,” said Bri-an J. Antal, the president of the St. Vincent De Paul Society in a phone interview Monday afternoon with the Washington Post. “It’s strictly in our bylaws not to do it. They showed up there, and they did not have permission. They got one of the volun-teers to open up the doors.”
According to NBC News, which followed up with Antal 
after Internet buzz indicated he voted in Democratic primaries before, “Ryan did very little work only compared to the larger context of Saturday morning, when the kitchen fed 180 home-less people breakfast. Antal conceded that Ryan did wash sev-eral dirty dishes.”
Ryan might have done some actual work. But he did it under 
such a guise of integrity . Can you imagine a pizza shop owner picking up Ryan for a hug? Never, because it would wrinkle Ryan’s oversized suit.
I sometimes hate that God answers my prayers.
It was years ago, as a naive young’un at UF, when I be-
gan to think I had a decent grasp on the world. I’d ﬁ  nally 
unraveled the enigma of my parents (and adults in general) 
and hungered for deeper mystic revelations.  
Foolishly , I asked God to let me see the world the way he 
saw it.
Boy, did he answer.Toward the end of my sophomore year, I became aware 
of the global human trafﬁ  cking industry , the systematic use of human beings as products for consumption by people with money. Sometimes human trafﬁ  cking takes the form of coerced labor, but, more often, it seems that human beings are used as objects of pleasure.
Perhaps the word “trafﬁ  cking” means nothing to you.   Fair enough.  I’ll put it into words that may resonate a bit more with our 
statistically driven news stream.  
There are more slaves today than there were during the 
entire transatlantic slave trade.
Take that in for a moment.  In light of this, I ask the question: Why would a loving 
God send people to hell?
Simple.  He answers prayers.  I’ll never forget the story about a girl who was a sex slave 
in an Indian brothel.   
Each night, tourists and sleazy men would violate her re-
peatedly as her pimp’s pockets fattened. In the middle of this, she somehow heard about the God who judged evildoers.  
Every night, she prayed that she would be liberated from 
her forced misery . She petitioned God for justice. One day , he answered.  
International Justice Mission found the brothel, had her 
pimp arrested and prosecuted and worked to change the le-gal infrastructure in her area. Google it if your jaw is still on the ﬂ  oor.
I ﬁ  nd the massive disparity between perceptions of judg-
ment intriguing.  
If you’re a postmodernist thinker earning a degree in the 
West, the idea of eternal damnation may make your stomach turn.  
Evil is probably something that 
you experience on the occasional movie screen.
However, if your entire exis-
tence has been marred by abuse, something in you longs for divine judgment.  
Personally , I’d prefer a God 
who was all hugs and tummy 
rubs, but God is not a pansy .  
He is a lawgiver.  I am speaking strictly in the Biblical sense, of course. The 
Bible outlines the character of God clearly . God is good at loving people, but he also loves goodness. Because he loves that which is good, he hates that which perverts it.
It pleases him to settle accounts, like the judge who hands 
down a sentence, knowing that justice has been served. He patiently watches as we pillage and plunder, pollute and rape, gossip and ruin, lie and steal and, ultimately, make ex-cuses for it all.  
We stand in his courtroom and audaciously hold him in 
contempt. We reason that it’s unfair to be sentenced for one offense, as if that would hold up in an actual court — as if we’ve only done wrong once.  
He prescribes a path that is scorned and disregarded at 
every turn, holding back his wrath from the people to whom he longs to be a father.  
He listens as we deﬁ  antly cry “my will be done.”He is patient, but there comes a day when the judgment 
hits the house.
God hears the cries for justice, and he emphatically says 
“yes!” He is good at answering prayers.
Heaven and hell are the answers to the prayers that we 
have prayed our whole life.  
Heaven is the response when we pray “your will be 
done.”
Hell — well, you get it.Ryan Galloway is a religion senior at UF. His column appears

Gaffes, in the heat of a 
presidential race, ini-tially appear to have 
a signiﬁ  cant impact. Reaction is generated in candidates’ stump speeches, debates, commercials and the news media.  
In 2012, we heard about 
Gov. Mitt Romney’s com-ments about the “47 percent” of Americans who “depend” on government.
We heard President Barack 
Obama’s words (taken out of context) that initiated the often-used  line “we did built that,” and Vice President Joe Biden’s statement that they’ll “put you all back in chains.”
These critical mistakes 
generated a signiﬁ  cant pres-ence in the short run. How-ever, in the long run, there is no question that gaffes of this nature have little to no impact. Both tickets running for the presidency make mis-takes so commonly that they should be received as typical and misplaced.
The emphasis on gaffes by 
the opposition generally tends to contribute to the negativity of the overall campaign. We can all agree that focusing on these errors further widens the divisions in politics and does anything but unite the nation.
To see the minimal impact 
gaffes have in the long run, we only need to look to four years ago when then Sen. Obama said that rural vot-ers “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immi-grant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustration.”
Do you remember this 
from the 2008 campaign?
When Sen. Obama made 
these controversial com-ments, he was met with much criticism.
At that moment, he was 
in a difﬁ  cult primary season with Hillary Clinton.
Like Obama’s criticism of 
Romney now, Sen. Clinton said that Americans “don’t need a president who looks down on them.”
Regardless of his ill-timed 
comments in rural Pennsyl-vania, Obama went on to win the nomination and later the presidency, with little to no detriment from this nor any other gaffe.
Like Clinton’s criticisms 
of Obama in 2008, the Obama campaign reacts in a similar nature to Romney; “It’s hard to serve as president for all Americans when you’ve dis-dainfully written off half the nation.”
Both candidates, with their 
respective gaffes, have quick-ly responded, saying that they didn’t say it as well as they should have or the phrasing was rather inadequate.
Following Romney’s “win-
ning” performance in the ﬁ  rst debate, it appears we have reached the end of hearing about his “47 percent” com-ment.While the Romney/Ryan 
ticket was still attacked on this issue in the vice presi-dential debate and in a recent Obama campaign ad, the is-sue has mostly blown over — until an aggressive President Obama possibly reinstates it on the campaign trail.
As evidenced by Gov. Rom-
ney’s recent surge in the polls, it appears the fact that he bla-tantly insulted almost half of the nation will be left to trivia — much like Obama’s previ-ous comments.  
Romney has effectively 
distanced himself from his controversial comments just as President Obama did in 2008.
It is clear the majority of 
voters do not consider these types of critical comments when deciding what candi-date to vote for. Gaffes in outlets of negative campaign-ing are generally not received well by voters.
When we count the ﬁ  nal 
tally Nov. 6, I expect the im-pact of gaffes to be trivial. They will be nothing more than a single line in a history book.

economics freshman at UF. His column appears on Wednesdays.
Gaffes won’t undermine candidatesColumn
Tax policy has been a focal point 
in this election, with both can-didates claiming their propos-
als “strengthen the middle class.”
Much of the presidential debate 
on Oct. 3 involved criticisms of the opponent’s tax policy.
Who is telling the truth?Well, like most issues in politics, 
it depends on how you deﬁ  ne the terms.
Let’s look at President Barack 
Obama ﬁ  rst. Although he claimed in the ﬁ  rst debate that he reduced taxes on the middle class by about $3,600, the reality is that those cuts were tem-porary.
The Making Work Pay tax credit 
saved the average family up to $800 a year, but it expired in 2011, and Obama did not renew it. The other tax cut Obama refers to, the payroll tax cut, expires at the end of this year as well.
We can’t forget the impact of 
Obamacare.
According to the Associated Press, 
nearly 6 million people will see a tax increase due to the new health in-surance law. Most of these 6 million people are in the “middle class” and will see their taxes rise by an average of $1,200 per year.
Gov. Mitt Romney’s plan relies on 
lowering tax rates and closing loop-holes to make up for the difference in revenue.
His plan has been criticized as 
“mathematically impossible” by the Obama campaign, which cites a study from a Princeton economist, Harvey Rosen.
Unfortunately for the president, 
Rosen soon spoke to the press claim-ing Obama misrepre-sented his study, say-ing:
“I can’t 
tell exactly how the Obama campaign reached that characterization of my work … The main conclusion of my study is that under plausible assump-tions, a proposal along the lines sug-gested by Gov. Romney can both be revenue neutral and keep the net tax burden on taxpayers with incomes above $200,000 about the same. That is, an increase in the tax burden on lower- and middle-income individu-als is not required in order to make the overall plan revenue neutral,” he wrote.
How is this possible? How can 
tax rates be reduced without slashing revenue? It all depends on economic growth.
Cutting tax rates often spurs eco-
nomic growth, becuase consumers have more money to spend and in-vest. As the economy grows, more people become wealthier and end up offsetting some of the revenue lost from lower rates.
Although Obama criticizes Rom-
ney’s plan because it “might” burden the middle class at some point, he ig-nores the fact that his own plans have not been particularly helpful, to say the least.
Even if Romney did need to even-
tually close some loopholes that beneﬁ  t the middle class, the tax cuts would ﬁ  rst and foremost give relief to middle-class Americans.

UF students can learn to avoid and 
break up potentially violent situations in a 
personal protection workshop this week-end.
The free seminar, The Art of Escape, 
will be from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Sunday in Southwest Recreation Center Activity Room 3, said Richard Serota, 30-year-old industrial engineering graduate student and vice president of Gator Karate.
Michael Kinney, a martial arts instruc-
tor who has taught around the world for about 50 years, will teach attendees tech-niques like how to watch and scan in dan-gerous situations and control breathing so they don’t hyperventilate.
“I will teach them how to use their 
brain and their mouth and their body to diffuse a situation that might become vio-lent,” Kinney said.
Serota hopes about 60 students will 
participate in the seminar. All UF stu-dents, regardless of gender, are welcome to attend, he said.
“Men are just as likely to get attacked,” 
Serota said.
Health science freshman Kelli Ahles, 
18, said she would be interested in attend-ing the workshop, because this is her first year living on her own.
“It could change my life if you think 
about it — like if I was ever in a situation where I needed it,” she said.Free martial arts class Sunday

Drones survey the country, the govern-
ment instills fear in its citizens and people 
wage war based on ideas in the United States right now.
Libertarian vice presidential candidate 
Jim Gray addressed these topics and others in a speech to about 30 people at the Reitz Union on Tuesday. Gray, whose running mate is Gary Johnson, said he believes in bringing back prosperity, equal opportuni-ties and freedom.
“We have an obese federal government 
today,” Gray said. “We have a govern-ment that is intruding into every part of our lives.”
Anyone could be labeled as a terrorist 
and legally held indefinitely, he said.
“If you lose your civil liberties to the 
government, you never get them back,” Gray said.
His administration would repeal the Pa-
triot Act, the National Defense Authoriza-tion Act and close Guantanamo Bay , which he called “an open sore on the soul of the United States of America.”
He also said the na-
tion’s drug policy does not work, naming it the biggest failed policy — second only to slavery.
Political science 
freshman Josue Rivera, 
18, said he wished more people knew about Gray’s speech.
“I think a lot of people are focused on 
the idea that they only have one of two choices,” Rivera said. “But there may be a third, more practical choice that people didn’t consider, because they didn’t know about it.”Libertarian candidate speaks

politics� TIA MCDONALD WILL BE ON 
THE COVER OF AN AUSTRALIAN TEEN NOVEL.
ALEXA VOLLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF student and Miss Teen Flori-
da 2011 is the face of Adora Niles.
Tia McDonald, a 19-year-old 
public relations junior, was chosen from thousands of women to por-
tray Niles, a character in the newly released teen fantasy novel “Fairy Tale — Once Upon A Time, Act 1.”
McDonald was photographed 
earlier this year as Niles for the cov-er of the novel, which was uploaded to self-publishing website, Lulu.com, by Australian author Somsay Toumngeun and formally released Sept. 15.
McDonald said she found her-self relating to Niles as she read the book.
“The character has a lot of quali-
ties that I represent,” she said. “I feel like it was a part of me as well.”
“Fairy Tale — Once Upon A 
Time, Act 1” is Toumngeun’s ﬁ  rst novel. He said he plans to publish a trilogy , which includes two acts per part. The second act of book one doesn’t have an ofﬁ  cial release date yet, but it should be out soon, he wrote in an email.
He said he envisioned Niles as a 
conﬁ  dent girl “who lived by virtu-ous and unwavering principles.”
Books like the “Twilight” and 
“Hunger Games” series have spurred a pop culture phenomenon around teen fantasy ﬁ  ction, but Toumngeun said his 585-page book is unique.
“What sets ‘Fairy Tale’ apart 
from the other teen novels is the fo-cus of the story ,” he said. “Despite all the magic, the monsters and the adventures, it is essentially about friendship and growing up.”
McDonald heard about the search 
for the book’s cover model through an international modeling agency. After the applicants were narrowed down by physical criteria, Toumn-geun interviewed the hopefuls.
“It sealed the deal,” McDonald 
said. “I was so excited when he called and told me the news.”
She bought a $2,000 plane ticket 
to Australia for the four-hour photo shoot.
Toumngeun said McDonald 
lived up to his expectations of Niles’ character.
“Upon meeting Tia, it became ap-
parent that she was that person, and possessed all the qualities I was after and more,” he said. “She is perfect for the part, and I feel there is no one else more suitable.”
Although she’s traveled the 
world gracing magazine pages and runways, McDonald said she’s proud of her appearance on the nov-el’s cover.
“With magazines, people will 
read them and then a new one comes out,” she said. “But I will always get to be the face of this ﬁ  ctional char-acter.”WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

UF’s Student Senate passed 
a bill Tuesday transfering 
$32,000 to the Student Gov-ernment Administration to construct a collegiate veterans success center and refurbish water fountains on campus.
The money, which comes 
from SG reserves, allocates $25,000 to the center and $7,000 to the water fountains project.
The center will be in Yon 
Hall and will serve as a gath-ering place for student veter-ans. The center will be set up within the next few months by the Department of Hous-ing and Residence Education, Senate President Christina Bonarrigo said after the meet-ing.
The $25,000 ensures ﬁ  ve 
exterior doors, three interior doors and two bathrooms compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act stan-dards. A sink and ice maker will also be installed, accord-ing to the bill.
“[It’s] to give back to veter-
ans who have done so much for us,” said Budget Commit-tee Chairman Joey Michaels.
The $7,000 will be used to 
reﬁ  t existing water fountains to promote sustainability on campus. In the next few weeks, gooseneck faucets will be added to 16 existing foun-tains to accommodate water bottle reﬁ  lls: three fountains in Matherly Hall, two in the Hub, three in Turlington Hall, two in Norman Hall, three in Weimer Hall and three in the Levin College of Law, Bonar-rigo said.  
The Senate also passed a 
resolution honoring Christian Aguilar, a UF student who went missing Sept. 20.
The Senate did not pass a 
resolution asking UF admin-istration to halt the removal of independently owned news-paper racks.
During the SG elections 
earlier this month, about 60 percent of students who voted on the referendum voted that they did not want the univer-sity to remove the racks.  
Sen. Cory 
Yeffet spoke against the 
resolution, saying the Alligator,  which is mentioned in the reso-
lution, is not a student orga-nization and should not be treated differently than other publications.
After the meeting, Sen. 
Umair Asghar, who wrote the resolution, said the Sen-ate didn’t represent student opinion.
“An injustice was done to 
the Student Body who voted to keep the racks,” he said.
Representatives from 
Nightlife Navigators also spoke about a new handicap-accessible Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol vehicle that would become available near the end of the semester.

Reed Up For NCAA Honor 
Jordan Reed was one of 25 players named to 
the midseason watch list for the John Mackey Award, given to the NCAA’s best tight end. ◗ UF’S MIKE GILLISLEE AND SOUTH CAROLINA’S MARCUS LATTIMORE LEAD OFFENSES. 
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  On Nov. 13, 2010, a trip to Atlan-
ta was at stake.
  South Carolina and Florida 
played in The Swamp with the 
Southeastern Conference East  title on the line. The winner would face Auburn in the Georgia Dome.
  During the next 60 minutes of 
football, Marcus Lattimore outmus-cled and overpowered the Gators. The freshman carried the ball 40 times for 212 yards and three touch-downs in a 36-14 Gamecocks win.
  Nearly two years later, Lattimore 
is a changed man.
  He suffered an ACL tear in his 
left knee against Mississippi State last October and missed South Caro-lina’s ﬁ  nal six games.
  Florida safety Josh Evans was on 
the ﬁ  eld during Lattimore’s last trip to Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. Evans sees a different Lattimore than be-fore.
  “He’s a good back, physical 
guy ,” Evans said. “I think he lost a step a little bit from what we’ve seen before. ... I think that’s due to the in-jury.”
  There was no easing back into the 
lineup for Lattimore this season. Not even one year removed from knee surgery , Lattimore reassumed his workhorse role in the Gamecocks’ offense. He leads the SEC with 129 carries through seven games.
  Gators coach Will Muschamp is 
convinced Lattimore is back to nor-mal.
  “He’s gotten his strength back and he’s a one-cut runner,” Mus-champ said. “He’s an outstanding runner.”
  Florida has a north-south run-
ner of its own in senior Mike Gil-lislee. While last season’s Gators relied more on jet sweeps and end-arounds with speedsters Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey , UF has a more traditional approach in the ground game this year.
  Perhaps his most impressive 
game to date was Florida’s 14-6 win against LSU on Oct. 6. Gillislee racked up 146 yards and two touch-downs on 34 carries against the

Powerful backs to face off on Saturday
ADAM BOMB
  This season has been one of tests for 
Florida. UF visited Texas A&M and the 12th Man, traveled to Knoxville 
to face pass-happy Tennessee and hosted a top-ﬁ  ve team that dominated them just a year ago in LSU.
  So far, the Gators have passed.  It doesn’t get any easier for Florida 
when No. 9 South Carolina and freakish defensive end Jadeveon Clowney come to Gainesville.
  The Gators are facing more challenges 
than those on the ﬁ  eld. 
How the team responds after reaching 
its highest ranking since Tim Tebow was quarterback will go a long way in proving Florida’s worth among the nation’s elite.
  Will Muschamp refused to acknowledge 
the signiﬁ  cance of rising to No. 2 in the ﬁ  rst BCS rankings.
  He said on Monday that nothing mat-
ters besides playing South Carolina this Saturday in The Swamp.
  Muschamp has a point: Championships 
aren’t won in the middle of October. But for a team that spent the last two years trapped in mediocrity, being No. 2 in the nation  means something.
  It means the second-year coach has 
changed the team’s identity to the physi-cal, no-excuses approach.
  It means the Gators are ﬁ  rmly in the national champi-onship discussion after two years of futility.
It means   Florida 
football is back.
  In 12 of the 14 
years that the BCS ranking system has 
been in place, at least one of the teams in the top two of the initial poll made an ap-pearance in the BCS Championship Game.
  With Alabama in the top spot and Flor-
ida right behind, the Gators are on track to reach their third BCS title game in seven years.  Florida hosts South Carolina in a game 
that will be won in the trenches, as UF’s victory against LSU was.
  Both Florida and South Carolina have 
elite running backs that carry the football close to 20 times per game. 
Both teams have athletic quarterbacks 
that can win games with their feet if need be.
The UF community is abuzz about a 
football game that the Gators, on paper, should win.
  “You walk through the campus and 
there’s people telling you good job and keep it up,” fullback Hunter Joyer said. 
 No. 2 BCS ranking means Florida is back in the spotlight  GREG LUCA 
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  If Jeff Driskel were a de-
fensive coordinator, he knows how he would try to slow down Florida’s offense. 
  “I would load the box,” 
Driskel said. “That’s what teams are going to start do-ing. … Obviously, we haven’t made that many plays in the passing game.”
  Through six games, Florida 
has the least productive pass-ing offense in the Southeast-ern Conference, throwing for only 145 yards per contest. 
  While UF’s rushing at-
tack is second in the SEC with 233.3 yards per game, Driskel has thrown only four touchdown passes, failing to eclipse 100 yards in either of the past two weeks. 
  But Driskel and offensive 
coordinator Brent Pease are concerned about only one stat: six wins, zero losses. 
  “That’s all that matters,” 
Driskel said. “If you’re win-ning, everything’s all right. Obviously we’ve got to get better in the passing game, but we’re winning games.” 
  Said Pease: “I don’t really 
care how it gets done, as long as we’re productive with what we do and score points.”
  Pease added that he would 
prefer Florida be more bal-anced offensively so oppo-nents can’t load the box on every play, but not at the expense of the game plan the Gators have drawn up to ex-ploit the opposition’s weak-nesses. 
  Counting sacks as pass at-
tempts, Florida has run the ball on 65.2 percent of its of-fensive plays this season. 
That im-balance is a far cry from 
Pease’s offense at Boise State last season, which attempted 485 passes and 484 rushes. 
  Still, the coordinator isn’t 
tempted to get back to his roots. He just wants to stick with what’s working. 
  “Let’s not get greedy here 
as a coach and say, ‘I don’t like that. I’m throwing the ball because that’s what we all love to do,’” Pease said. “If Jeff Driskel can carry the ball 70 yards and outrun every-body, he’s getting the ball. If Mike Gillislee can get the ball and outrun everybody, he’s Gators content with

◗ BARNEY HAS FIVE GOALS.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

McKenzie Barney has scored 
many goals in her career at Florida, 
but after suffering season-ending facial fractures in 2011, one goal overshadowed the rest: staying healthy.
“That was kind of one of my big-
gest goals” she said. “Making sure that I have enough time to get treat-ment, get rest, stay hydrated … so I can be at my best for this team.”
Barney has achieved that goal 
for most of this season. She missed the Gators’ 3-1 victory against Ole Miss with a knee injury but has played in the rest of Florida’s 16 games.
Being healthy isn’t enough for 
the redshirt senior. As a forward, she needs to score.
“That’s kind of my job,” she 
said.
For the past four seasons, Bar -
ney has done her job.
So far in 2012, she is tied with 
Havana Solaun and Jo Dragotta for the UF lead in goals with five. 
Despite being  one of the team 
leaders in scoring, Barney’s season still falls short of matching her pre-vious campaigns. In 2009, her first year of action with the team after suffering an ACL tear her fresh-man year, she scored eight goals. In 2010, she led the Southeastern Con-ference champions with 14 goals.
In total, Barney has scored 31 
goals, which is good for seventh in Florida’s record books, behind players like FIFA Women’s World Cup Champion Danielle Fotopou-los and Olympic gold medal win-ner Abby Wambach.
“It is an absolute honor to be on 
that list with them,” Barney said. 
As good as Barney has been on 
the field, coach Becky Burleigh said she thinks Barney’s biggest impact has been off the field.
“Her legacy is going to be a lot 
more than just goals scored,” Bur -
leigh said. “She’s been the epitome of work ethic. She’s been a terrific leader. She always gets this team fired up when we need it to be. … Her ability to recognize what the team needs and provide that is re-ally important.”
Senior Erika Tymrak has played 
with Barney in the attacking third for the past four years, and the two have combined for 11 goals.
“[Barney] is probably one of the 
easiest players to play with because she affects the play, no matter what she does,” Tymrak said. “She’ll make a run knowing she’s not go-ing to get the ball just to create space for the person dribbling.”
Said Barney: “I love playing 
with Erika.”
Barney was a key player on 
the 2010 SEC championship team, scoring two goals in the conference tournament. With only three games remaining before this year’s tour -
nament and the Gators on a nine-game winning streak, Barney is looking to get hot at the right time.
Although Barney already has an 
SEC title under her belt, the senior still has one thing she is looking to accomplish during the final stretch of her college career: an NCAA championship.
“It’s the goal,” she said.14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2012

Florida entered the final round of the 
Jerry Pate National Intercollegiate with a 
seven-stroke lead but could not secure the win in Vestavia Hills, Ala. 
After shooting a 282 (+2) in the first 
round and a 286 (+6) in the second, UF closed the tournament with a 293 (+13) to finish four strokes behind host and South-eastern Conference rival Alabama on Tues-day. 
Florida finished the tournament at 861 (+21). 
“We have to work on closing,” coach 
Buddy Alexander said. “We have to make our guys tougher when it matters most.”
Alabama finished with an 857 (+17), in-
cluding a tournament-low 282 (+6) in the final round to secure a team victory. 
Throughout the fall season, seniors T.J. 
Vogel and Tyler McCumber have anchored the Gators lineup. 
Tuesday was no different. After a fog delay led to a suspension 
of play on Monday, McCumber and Vogel concluded the tournament in 214 strokes (+4), earning a tie for sixth place. 
Vogel was the only Gator to finish the 
third round at even par. The bounceback 
followed a second round in which he struggled, hitting  five bogeys.
Tuesday marked Vo-
gel’s third straight top-10 finish to open the season 
and McCumber’s second top-10 finish since earn-ing a tie for second at The 
Invitational at The Ocean Course in Ki-awah Island, S.C., on Sept.11. “T.J. Vogel played well early,” Alexan-
der said. 
Tommy Mou rounded out the seniors, 
shooting 219 (+9) following his tourna-ment-low first round 68 (-2) on Monday. Mou was competing in his first tourna-ment since last year’s Gator Invitational. 
Freshman A.J. Crouch carded a 225 
(+15), while J.D. Tomlinson shot a 218 (+8).  
The Gators look to finish in the top two 
for the fourth time this season when they travel to Windermere for the Isleworth In-vitational hosted by Texas Tech and UCF.

golf“Saying they’re really excited for this 
weekend, so it’s a pretty good vibe.”
Joyer said he received the same 
treatment before last season’s matchup against Alabama,  but unfortunately for Florida, the good vibes were lim-ited for the remainder of 2011.
The Gators couldn’t generate a con-
sistent running or passing attack, they couldn’t defend late in games, and they couldn’t field a healthy team. Ba-sically, they stunk.
Fans have seen the transformation 
from a barely bowl-eligible team to an SEC heavyweight. 
“It helps a lot,” senior safety Josh 
Evans said about home-field advan-tage. “That little bit of edge and mo-tivation you hear from our fans cheer -
ing us on, the good luck that they’re giving us, it definitely helps us a lot.”.
Redshirt senior wide receiver 
Frankie Hammond Jr. said he had not played in a Ben Hill Griffin Stadium atmosphere like the one he experi-enced against LSU on Oct. 6 for a long time.
“Having the stadium packed, es-
pecially the LSU game, it got pretty loud,” Hammond said. 
“It definitely brought back memo-
ries of my freshman and sophomore year here, so it’s getting back. But, like I said, we’ve got to take it a game at a time and just move forward from there.”
Hammond isn’t the only player not 
looking at the rankings. 
The entire team has scoffed at the 
notion that being No. 2 holds any sig-nificance.
Sure, championships aren’t won in 
October. But they can be lost in this month. 
Florida found that out the hard way 
last season.
On Saturday, the Gators play their 
first game as a BCS top-five team in three seasons. To say that doesn’t mean anything is selling the program short.

NCAA’s No. 2 defense.
Gillislee leads all SEC running backs with 
100.5 yards per game and is on pace to become 
the first Gator to eclipse the 1,000-yard mark since Ciatrick Fason did in 2004.
“[Gillislee is] just an all-purpose back,” 
wideout Frankie Hammond Jr. said. “He can run between the tackles when he wants to, and then when it’s time to get outside and break away and use his speed he does that as well.”
Saturday’s game will feature two of the top 
five running backs in the SEC. The last time Lattimore was in Gainesville, he outrushed Florida by 177 yards.
This time around, the Gators are much more 
confident in their chances in the ground game. Like Lattimore and South Carolina, Gillislee and Florida are tough running the football.
“You need to be able to have a hardness to 
your program, a physicality to your program, running the football and being able to stop the run,” Muschamp said. “There’s going to come a time when you’re trying to end the game. You better be able to run it.”

blocks like they block, we’re giv-ing them the ball. I’m not going to be stubborn.” 
Clowney to challenge UF: No 
player on the talented South Car -
olina defense commands more at-tention than defensive end Jade-veon Clowney. 
“You need to account for him,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “He can ruin your day.”
Clowney, a sophomore, has 
racked up 6.5 sacks this season. At 6 feet, 6 inches and 256 pounds, Clowney has the size, athleticism and quickness to be a nightmare for opposing quarterbacks. 
Clowney enrolled at South Car -olina as the top-
ranked player in the 2011 class, according to Rivals.com. Al-though Clowney won’t be eligible to turn pro un-til 2014, some 
scouts have projected him as an eventual top-five pick in the NFL Draft. 
“He’s what you’re looking 
for,” Muschamp said. 
Muschamp and Frankie Ham-
mond Jr. said the Gators will likely try to slow Clowney by chipping him with a back or tight end. 
Pease said cut blocking 
Clowney won’t work because he has the ability to jump over the block. The key, Pease said, is to be physical and run at him. At least that way, Clowney won’t be able to chase the Gators down from behind. 
“He’s a talented guy,” Ham-
mond said. “He’s going to get his plays. ... We’ll look at film, break things down and find ways just to slow him down.”

Last season, Kenny Boynton 
had an opportunity to advance the 
Gators to the Final Four.
After Bradley Beal missed a three-
pointer with 11 seconds left on the clock, he grabbed his own rebound and sent it back out to Boynton, who was waiting behind the arc. Boynton missed, Beal fouled and Louisville increased its lead as UF’s season ended in a 72-68 loss. 
It wasn’t how the Gators wanted 
to end their season, and it wasn’t the way Boynton hoped to finish his ca-reer at Florida. 
“I definitely want to go out as 
a winner, and that’s one reason I came back,” Boynton said. “When you have one more shot at it, it’s only one way. You’re only think-ing championship. I’m going to try my best personally and to push this team to get deep in the tournament again this year.” 
Entering his final season, Boyn-
ton is only 501 points shy of Ron-nie Williams’ school record of 2,090. Boynton has averaged 529.7 points per season during his first three years.
Boynton also hopes that returning 
for his final season will increase his chances of making it to the NBA.
“Playing point guard will help 
my chances in getting to the next level,” Boynton said. “I think last year was a strong draft, and I would have a better chance in going this year.” 
Boynton will be changing roles 
this season. Coach Billy Donovan would like to see Boynton be UF’s new vocal leader after the team lost point guard Erving Walker to grad-uation. 
“With Erving not being here, 
hopefully [Boynton] can step up into more of a leadership role for us,” Donovan said. “Kenny has been one of those kind of quiet leaders where he doesn’t say a whole lot. I think a lot of times it’s done through how he performs and how hard he plays.”
Although he wants Boynton to be 
more vocal on the court, Donovan is cautious about putting the senior in an uncomfortable situation. Last season, Donovan pushed the quiet Walker into a leadership role — a process that was more difficult than expected.
However, Boynton has enjoyed 
his new role so far. He said he’s good at breaking down plays for the freshmen. 
In addition to replacing Walker 
as a leader, Florida will need Boyn-ton to fill his shoes at point guard. Walker left Florida as its all-time as-sists leader, racking up 547 in four years. 
Boynton also plans to focus on 
being more consistent in his final season. Boynton made 45.8 percent of his 
threes in the first half of last season before hitting only 34.9 percent af-ter playing South Carolina on Jan. 14. Boynton shot only 5 of 24 from beyond the arc in the NCAA Tour -
nament. 
“I’m going to try to stay in the 
gym as much as possible this year,” Boynton said. “Just get a lot of rep-etition. Basically prepare my body for the middle of the season when my body gets tired.” 
Boynton hopes that spending 
his summer in Las V egas working on his conditioning and playing five-on-five games with profession-als such as Dion Waiters, Maalik Wayns, Tu Holloway and Hollis Thompson will help him excel in his new role this season.
“I pretty much tried to play point 
guard no matter what team I was on,” Boynton said. “The way they play is more physical. It helped me coming in every day and working with guys like that.”

Carlie Needles expected to 
contribute heavily last season.
The redshirt freshman 
from Highlands Ranch, Colo., 
anticipated joining a Gators backcourt full of veteran talent she could learn from and play alongside. On Nov. 6, every-thing changed. 
Five days before Florida’s 
women’s basketball team  opened its season against Mich-igan, Needles’ year ended. She suffered ACL and meniscus tears in her left knee during a scrimmage. 
When trainers gave her the 
news days later, she felt a range of emotions.
“I cried for about 15 sec-
onds,” she said. “Then I thought about what I had to do next to get back.”
She spent the offseason 
walking through Ben Hill Grif-fin Stadium to strengthen her knee before beginning therapy sessions. Eleven months after the injury, she is back.
With much of last season’s 
backcourt gone, Needles will step into a prominent role. Ja-terra Bonds is the lone return-ing guard who averaged more than 20 minutes per game in 2011-12.
Gators coach Amanda But-
ler said she sees similarities be-tween Bonds and Needles.
“I compare [Needles] to Ja-
terra in the way that she leads and the way that she is so ag-gressive in how she controls the floor,” Butler said. “[Needles] is not hesitant at all to address a teammate in a positive way and certainly sometimes when it’s got to be in an enforcing way .” 
Needles said there were fac-
ets of the game she better un-derstands after spending a sea-son watching from the bench.
Most notably , she said the 
team has to improve its ability to fin-
ish games. Of UF’s 13 losses last season, 10 were decided by six points or fewer — 
including two in overtime.
“It’s the little things that you 
don’t think about that make a difference,” she said, identify-ing the team’s poor percentage from the free-throw line late in games as a specific example. 
Butler agreed, saying the 
Gators have to learn to close out games in the final four min-utes, a point when UF often let games slip away last season. 
That begins with the focus 
Needles can bring in her return to the court. 
“Carlie has taken full ad-
vantage of the year that she did have to sit and wait,” But-ler said. “She was already a kid whose fire burned pretty bright, and it was almost like pouring a bunch of gasoline on that passion that was already inside of her.”Back after ACL tear,
