UF ADMINISTRATION
Machen: No more cuts
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@a Iligator org
He knows it could come back to haunt
him, but he's willing to take that chance.
Fresh off a year plagued by budget cuts,
UF President Bernie Machen said he's ready
to predict there will be no more cuts to UF's
budget next spring.
"The economy seems to be stabilized,
(which) allows us to kinda get back on terra
firma," Machen said in an interview Wednes-
day.
"I just think it's gonna be a positive year
after a pretty negative year," he said. "I'm
going to venture out there .the fool that I
am.",
Although UF needs to cut about $16 mil-
lion from its budget this year, Machen said
the university plans to hire more faculty to
stem the brain drain and reduce UF's high
faculty-student ratio, which clocks in at over
20-to-1.
The hires initially will be paid for by stim-
ulus money, then covered by differential tu-ition funds, he said.
They will help to counteract the net loss of
81 faculty since last August, he said.
"What we're anxious to do is get back into
a hiring mode," he said.
More details of the plan will be announced
at today's State of the University speech at 3
p.m. in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
Machen said part of the $42 million in
stimulus funds UF has been allocated will be
used to cover $16 million that UF still hasn't
decided how to cut.
That figure used to be $11.6 million, ac-
cording to plans announced in May, but Ma-
chen conceded Wednesday that those calcu-
lations were off the mark.
The cuts will still come from the same
places, which means they will not involve
reductions or eliminations of academic pro-
grams or employee layoffs, he said.
The cuts likely will be announced in No-
vember or December after a discussion with
the university community.
Proposals being considered include chang-
es to vacation and sick-leave policies as well

Pastor defends shirts
By J. HUNTER SIZEMORE
Alligator Staff Writer
jhsizemore@alligator org
A pair of black flats, jeans and a
white T-shirt bearing "Islam is of the
Devil" in red stenciled lettering across
the back-this was Emily Sapp'sback-
to-school outfit Monday at Gainesville
High School.
When she wore a similar outfit on
Tuesday, she was sent to the princi-
pal's office before reaching first pe-
riod. The school administration gave
Sapp, 16, three options: change into
other clothing, cover up the phrase or
go home.
Sapp chose home, but she didn't
feel nervous about the decision.
"I think I was already ready," she
said.
She is one of six young church
members at the Dove World OutreachCenter who have worn the shirts,
which display the Bible verse John
14:6 on the front, to local elementary,
middle and high schools.
A sign lettered with the same mes-
sage has stood in
front of the Dove
Center since early
July.On Wednes-
day, head church
members were
contacted by the
American Civil
Jones Liberties Union
and a conference was held later in the
day, said Terry Jones, senior pastor at
the church.
"We are not sure how far we want
to push it, but we want to accomplish
what we have set out to accomplish,"

Three shiny blue scooters, two Lincoln Town Cars and a
mini bus stood waiting as about 60 UF students socialized
at The Swamp Restaurant Wednesday night.
The vehicles belonged to Fabulous Rides, a new service
that offers transportation anywhere in Gainesville for resi-
dents unable to drive themselves home after a
Local night of drinking, said Ray Land, president of
NewS Fabulous Rides.
Land said he expected rides to be given out
to about 150 people Wednesday night.
Fabulous Rides will offer free rides to students until Sat-
urday, although rides will normally cost $20 for the scooter
service, $25 for the Lincoln Town Car and $45 for the mini
bus. The service will run until 3 a.m.
The company worked with Student Government, which
organized the event in order to kick off its new DUI preven-
tion program, said Dana Somerstein, the External Affairs

BOSTON -Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, the liberal lion of the Sen-

fell to assassins' bullets, has died at
his home in Hyannis Port after bat-
tling a brain tumor. He was 77.

war and peace. To the Ameri-
can public, though, he was best
known as the last surviving son
of America's most glamorous
political family, the eulogist of a
clan shattered again and again
by tragedy.
"We've lost the irreplaceable
center of our family and joyous
light in our lives, but the inspira-
tion of his faith, optimism, and
perseverance will live on in our
hearts forever," his family wrote
in a statement.
Kennedy was elected to the
Senate in 1962, when his brother
John was president, and served
longer than all but two senators
in history. Over the decades, he
put his imprint on every major
piece of social legislation to clear
the Congress.
To the moon, NASA? Not
on this budget, experts say
WASHINGTON -NASA
will test the powerful first stage
of its new Ares moon rocket
Thursday, a milestone in a pro-
gram that has already spent $7
billion for a rocket that astro-
nauts may never use.
When that first stage is tested,
it will be mounted horizontally.
The engine will fire, shake and
make lots of noise. But by design,
it will not leave the ground. The
same could be said for NASA's
plans to go to the moon, Mars
or beyond Earth orbit. It's not
so much a physical challenge for
engineers as it is a financial chal-
lenge for budgeteers.
The $108 billion program to
return to the moon by 2020 was
started five years ago by then-
President George W. Bush. But a
special independent panel com-
missioned by President Barack
Obama concluded that the plan
cannot work on the existing bud-
get schedule because it's likely to
cost at least an extra $30 billion
through 2020.

STUDENT LIFE
Politicians discuss health coverage
By KATIE EMMETS
Alligator Staff Writer
kemmets@alligator org
Upon graduating from Colorado
State University in 2004, Abby Berendt
landed her dream job at a large media
corporation in New York City. Berendt
had been working full time at the com-
pany for 10 months when she arrived
at work one day with what she thought
was a horrible stomachache.
Because her company only offered
insurance to those employed for a year,
Berendt Googled hospitals that accepted
people without health insurance.
After 12 hours of being connected to
an I. V., Berendt was told she needed
emergency surgery to take out an ovari-
an tumor the size of a golf ball. Although
she was treated and healed, she was left
with more than $12,000 in bills.
In a Wednesday conference call,
Congressman Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.,
said he is working to give those in situa-
tions like Berendt's a break.
"We need to preserve what's best
and fix what's broken," Van Hollen
said. "[Health care] is very broken foryoung people because they have huge
problems getting access to quality af-
fordable health care."
Van Hollen said those starting ca-
reers are predicted to change jobs four
or five times during their lives, losing
their health insurance each time.
"We want young
people to be entrepre-
neurs," he said. "We
don't want them to
feel trapped in a job
because it's the only
place they get quality
health care."
Van Hollen Proposed legisla-
tion in the U.S. House
of Representatives will make health care
cheaper by adding affordability credits
and allowing young people to stay on
their parents' plans until the age of 26.
"Right now a lot of young people are
being forced off of their parents' policies
between the ages of 19 and 22," he said.
Thomas Bates, Vice President of Civ-
ic Engagement for Rock the Vote, said in
the call that he thinks current employer-
based insurance plans aren't working
for those just beginning their careers."Half of the young people who do
not have insurance actually work full
time," Bates said. "They are just not in
jobs where their employers are provid-
ing health coverage."
Because young people have the high-
est rate of unemployment, Bates said
students who are not getting jobs when
they graduate are worsening an already
fragile situation.
"Half of the people who are under
the age of 26 are already in some kind
of medical debt," he said. "If you add
that to the higher cost of education and
this unemployment issue, you really
are talking about a systemic failure that
needs to be addressed."
To pay her hospital bills, Abby Be-
rendt's parents had to refinance their
house.
The self-proclaimed healthy, salad-
eating, three-miles-a-day runner had
two more months until her coverage be-
gan, but she said she couldn't wait.
"The saddest thing to me about this
whole story is that the situation isn't un-
common," she said. "Everyone should
have the right to get health care when
they need it and not go bankrupt for it."THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 3
'Messing with
cousin' leads
to two arrests
* ABOUT 50 WITNESSED THE FIGHT.
Two Gainesville women were arrested after
their fight in a downtown parking lot drew a crowd
of about 50 people.
When Gainesville Police officers responded to
Club Decadence, 12 SW Second St., at about 1:30
a.m., they saw Tawanna Smalls, 21, and Patricia
Palmer, 21, punching, kicking and wrestling with
each other.
Although GPD spokesman Keith Kameg said it
never became clear why the women were fighting,
officers reported that they heard Smalls say that she
would seek revenge on someone while Palmer said
she was fighting because someone was "messing
with her cousin," according to the arrest report.
According to the report, the fight between
Smalls and Palmer caused several smaller fights to
break out.

Consumer confidence rises
By JESSICA CHAPMAN
Alligator Writer
Although the country is
still deep in recession, con-
sumers think it may get better
soon.
Based on results from the
Conference Board Consumer
Research Center and the UF
Bureau of Economic and Busi-
ness Research, people across
the country are feeling better
about the economy this month
than last month.
The Conference Board's
Consumer Confidence Index,
which serves as a gauge of
economic health, rose from
47.4 in July to 54.1 this month,
according to a report released
Tuesday.
The Expectations Index,
which illustrates how consum-
ers feel about the economic fu-
ture, jumped from 63.4 to 73.5
in July, the highest level since
December 2007, according to
the report.
The index reflects the idea
that consumers expect the
economy to improve over thenext five years as a result of
what they have seen or heard
in the news, economics pro-
fessor David Denslow said.
He said the recession could
move in different directions,
and the increase suggests it
will be a positive one.
The economy could contin-
DenslowAue to "scrape
the bottom"
for a while
and then
bounceback,
or it could
take another
decline, he
explained.
"It's still
miserable, but at least [the
numbers] are up," Denslow
said. "It will be a sluggish re-
covery, but [the results offer]
useful information."
Lynn Franco, director of
the Conference Board, said
the results offer good news
to consumers, explaining that
the index has bounced back
from a fall in June and July.
"The road to recovery is
never smooth," Franco said."The worst of economic times
are behind us, but there's still
a ways to go."
The Florida index conduct-
ed by the UF Bureau of Eco-
nomic and Business Research
showed similar results, with
Florida's confidence index ris-
ing three points to 70.
The rise in confidence is a
result of stock market gains,
rising house prices and a lack
of more setbacks in the na-
tional economy, according to
a release.
Despite overall improved
confidence in the economy,
confidence in some categories
did not rise.
Consumers' perception of
personal finances remained
the same, while willingness
to buy big-ticket items fell by
five points to 72, according to
the Bureau's survey.
"It all depends on whether
or not you are worse off now
than you were a year ago,"
Denslow said. "And of course
you are [worse off]. It will be
a weak recovery. It won't be
vigorous."ACLU met with church leaders
SHIRTS,from page 1
he said, citing conversionof Muslims
from Islam as one of the goals, Jones
said. According to Jones, the phrase
targets Islam because of its growth
in the United States and Europe, but
any religion that does not offer Jesus
as the savior is of the devil, includ-
ing Judaism.
"We are not for any hostility to-
ward the individual; we are against
the religion," he said. "[Some Mus-
lims] may know no better."
But UF Anthropology of Religion
professor Gerald Murray said the
tactic isn't sound.
"You attract more flies with hon-
ey than vinegar, and that's vinegar,"
he said. "If the goal is to win Mus-
lims, this is not the way to go about
it."
Clay Calvert, a First Amendment
expert at UF's Brechner Center, be-
lieves that the T-shirt wearers may
have a case against the school.
"There is no First Amendment
right to not be offended," he said.
The school's dress code states
that students must "wear clothes
and accessories which are not dan-
gerous to health or safety [and] do
not disrupt the learning process."
The Supreme Court has ruled
that wording of this sort is too vague
and that schools must demonstrate
that a message disrupts school, such
as causing fights or school skipping,in order to censor religious or politi-
cal messages, he said.
Calvert suggests an approach
other than censorship.
"Throw more speech out into the
marketplace of ideas," he said. "Put
out an argument to counter theirs if
you don't like it."
But Jackie Johnson, spokes-
woman for Alachua County Public
Schools, said the issue is simple.
"From our point of view, this is a
violation of the dress code like any
other, though it may
Local be receiving more at-
News tention than most,"
she said.
Kenneth Wald, a
politics and religion expert at UF,
said the school system's case is
strong.
"The school is well within their
right," he said. "Legally, I don't
think [the students] have a foot to
stand on."
Wald is harshly critical of the stu-
dents' involvement in the spread of
the church's message.
"When I first heard the story
I thought of it as child abuse and
mind-poisoning," he said.
Wald's criticism was unsurpris-
ing to Jones.
"Of course we expected that to
come up," he said. "That is why we
did try to express to the children
that there would be no consequenc-
es or rewards from us if they went
ahead."

PetSnip helps owners in need
By EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Staff Writer
efuggetta@alligator org
Operation PetSnip's surgery
room is only slightly larger than
the average bathroom.
Despite squeezing its entire
operation into a roughly 50-by-
9-foot trailer called the "Big Fix
Rig," No More Homeless Pets'
newest venture has spayed and
neutered more than 105 cats and
dogs since it was stationed out-
side the Alachua County Hu-
mane Society on Aug. 17.
PetSnip, a low-cost service
aimed at low-income pet owners,
runs on goodwill. The "Big Fix
Rig" was donated by the North
Carolina-based Humane Alli-
ance.
Operational costs are drawing
from a $250,000 donation from
local philanthropist Gladys Cof-
rin and a matched amount from
Alachua County.
Cofrin, an animal lover who
has owned and rescued pitbulls
since the 1970s, said she hopes
the grant will help to reduce
the population of dogs and cats,
which is out of control in Alach-
ua county.
According to Animal Services
director David Flagler, AlachuaCounty has worked toward de-
creasing its population of home-
less animals for years but has
exhausted the ideas and funding
for getting animals adopted.
"We've reached the capac-
ity of the adoption efforts," he
said. "At some point, you have to
start targeting the problem at its
source."
"We've reached the capac-
ity of the adoption efforts.
At some point, you have to

Animal service director of
Alachua County
The Big Fix Rig will remain at
2909 NW Sixth St. until Sept. 1,
when it will relocate to just north
of 39th Avenue on the same street
-the location of the future Hu-
mane Society building.
Operation PetSnip will con-
tinue offering its services from
the rig until the construction of
its permanent clinic is completed
in the Humane Society building,
which is scheduled for 2010, ac-
cording to No More Homeless
Pets clinical operations managerJessica Torrence.
Operation Petsnip performs
spay and neuter surgeries on
cats and dogs under 40 pounds,
but Torrence said dogs over 40
pounds will be welcome as soon
as PetSnip gets equipment that
can handle the extra weight -
hopefully in the next few weeks.
Although other local low-
cost services only accept animals
based on breed or owner income
or location, Operation PetSnip
does not have prerequisites for
surgeries, which cost $40 for cats
and $60 for dogs.
Torrence said people who
can afford standard veterinary
service should continue to go
to their regular clinics in order
to keep space open for those in
need, but they do not require
proof of need.
"You'll always see people tak-
ing advantage," she said, "but
mainly the people who have been
coming in have been those that
do have the need."
Torrence said she can't esti-
mate when the grant will run
out.
"There is money out there to be
had," she said. "But our program
is excellent and necessary. Hope-

Childish Church
Anti-Islam shirts pathetic
ploy to get attention
he Dove World Outreach Center has already blurred
the lines between a church and a for-profit enterprise
and the lines between a place of "outreach" and a place
that calls for exclusion.
It is now blurring the line between protected free speech
and a classroom disruption.
Students have been sent home from Gainesville public
schools for wearing shirts with the center's "Islam is of the
Devil" slogan. The slogan caused controversy in July when it
appeared on a sign outside the church.
The Dove World Outreach Center has been involved in
shady business from the get-go, with former members of its
academy now coming forward to say they were put to work
for the church's pastor, who used their unpaid labor for his
own profit. After being rebuked for their anti-Islam sign and
embarrassed by the investigation into their business practic-
es, it seems the members of the Dove World Outreach Center
are really pulling for straws, like a painfully unremarkable
middle child pining for attention.
The controlling members of the church are technically
adults, but that hasn't stopped them from behaving like chil-
dren.
Using their offspring to shove hateful messages into the
faces of others is cowardly. Because those bearing the mes-
sage are blameless (or just clearly brainwashed) minors, the
propagators of this speech are protected from direct confron-
tation. Technically, the schools' administrations can't kill
the messengers. Likewise, a person incensed by the message
can't slug a 12-year-old in the face. Freedom of speech does
not mean freedom from the consequences of speech, and by
outsourcing their message onto some pitiable adolescents (or
preadolescents), the members of the Dove World Outreach
Center are also outsourcing the consequences of their ac-
tions.
We are against squelching any kind of personal expres-
sion, but this is a totally different thing from the symbolic
speech protected by the Supreme Court in Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent School District.
Black Panther armbands weren't about hate or violence
but its antithesis, as they called for an end to the Vietnam
War. Those armbands wouldn't offend or distract anyone in
a school unless LBJ's children happened to be in the same
calculus class as the protesters. All these "Islam is of the Dev-
il" shirts do is promote intolerance and discrimination to a
bunch of impressionable children.
The administrations of these schools acted appropriately
in asking the students wearing the "Islam is of the Devil"
t-shirts to cover up. A public school should be a refuge from
religious proclamation and hate speech. If the school officials
did nothing as students openly condemned other students
on the basis of their beliefs, they would be complicit in the
hate speech. This, in turn, would be a total affront to the sep-
aration of church and state.
A church has the right to display a hateful sign in public.
If someone feels strongly about it, they can make their own
sign. (Hey, that's the definition of free speech.) Bringing the
church's hate speech into an educational environment is an
entirely different scenario.
Let's hope that a third controversy will put Pastor Terry
Jones and his army of hate-mongering man-children to bed.

Obama-Hitler comparison
resident Obama has pushed ahead on a plan tooverhaul the American health-insurance racket,
skipping merrily down a path that tripped up
every Democratic politician since Demosthenes. Select
groups of highly motivated individuals, deeply trou-
bled by this government's foray into health care, have
been so vocal with their displeasure that some of their
vitriol has ended up in my inbox.
Though I have long since become accustomed to a
barrage of alarming e-mails from mysterious people
concerned with the relative size of my genitals and of-
fering great deals on Cialis and Viagra, a recent spate of
startling, non-spam e-mail sent to my account nonethe-
less took me by surprise.
Don't get me wrong -I enjoy a divisive political ar-
gument as much as the next patriot. But I was beginning
to get tired of the comparisons between Adolf Hitler
and Barack Obama.
Hitler forever ruined the tiny mustache look for all
of Western civilization, and he was the person most
responsible for the Holocaust. Obama has not done
anything as reprehensible as these twin crimes against
humanity, though he is guilty of some very reasonable
hubris and seems to detest reading the legislation he
talks up so dreamily.
It turns out I was wrong in dismissing the Hitler-
Obama comparisons so quickly, as one of the angry
e-mails I received sleuthed out a shocking program
hidden somewhere in the health care bill passed by the
House earlier this month.
Everybody knows about Cash for Clunkers, the col-
loquial name for a government program that generated
an avalanche of press coverage and thousands of tenu-H

ous new car loans (as well as mil-
lions in new consumer debt). Ac-
cording to the digital watchdogs,
there is a nefarious plan hatched
by Obama himself to tackle both
the rising obesity levels in our
country and the debt burden fac-
ing each American family.
Cash for Chunkers involves
giving $10,000 to American families who call a govern-
ment hotline and report each family member with a
BMI of 30 or higher.
After a six-month grace period to allow offenders the
chance to slim down, these self-reported violators enter
into a secret government database.
Government agents, possibly conspiring with the
Illuminati, will storm houses known to harbor huge
humans and kidnap everyone who has not shed their
extra heft. These violators will slave off their weight in
government-led work camps aimed at fighting invasive
species. Here in Florida, the bigger amongst us could
be sent to the Everglades to do battle with non-native
snakes and yank out tons of kudzu.
Thankfully, the plans for this offensive and possi-
bly illegal government program have found their way
to my e-mail inbox. Ever vigilant, my digital watchdog
compatriots have sent me the all-knowing light of truth.
And now, dear readers, I hope to inspire you to send
off your own ranting e-mails to your friends and loved
ones. All I ask is that you refrain from sending a copy
to me.

Letters to the Editor
DUI campaign sends wrong message
Drinking and driving is bad -there is
no denying that fact. As somebody who files
claims for an insurance company, I have heard
the horror stories from the victims' families
first-hand. I agree that Fabulous Rides sounds
like a fabulous program and the Student Body
president ought to be commended for trying
to promote awareness of its existence in an ef-
fort to reduce drunken driving. However, his
approach sells the dangers short.
First, his angle is one of selfishness. The
message here isn't that you shouldn't drink
and drive because you could crash your car,
possibly killing yourself, your passengers and
innocent bystanders. Instead, it is sold on the
idea you might avoid a DUI. Your life and the
lives of others are always more important than
your driving record. Additionally, the fact the
launch event is at the biggest watering hole in
town is also irresponsible.
Student Government doesn't belong in the
business of bar advertisement and promo-
tion. Ever. According to the National Council
on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, heavy
drinkers are eight times more likely than non-
binge drinkers to miss a class, fall behind in
schoolwork, get hurt or injured and damage
property. To promote drinking on a Wednes-
day night under the guise of a new taxi service
misses the mark almost entirely.
Joseph Trimboli
4LSProgress Party shouldn't promote power
I was very disturbed to read in Wednes-
day's Alligator about Progress Party Leader
David Schneider's blatant intellectual dishon-
esty. To say that giving the Student Body pres-
ident the unilateral ability "to create executive
orders to create offices, departments and poli-
cies" would "discourage too much centraliza-
tion of one power," as the article stated, is ex-
actly the opposite of what is going to happen.
This is a shoot-first-ask-questions-later pol-
icy, and it hinges on the idea that the Student
Body president will actually inform the Sen-
ate of everything he's doing or has done in a
timely manner to give them the opportunity
to tell him no. Won't happen. Tuesday night,
the majority party in Senate (Unite) voted to
centralize more power into the executive, also
controlled by the Unite Party. The Progress
Party, who supposedly ran in opposition to
Unite, had its leadership champion this?
Sounds like Unite Lite to me.
Taylor Cinalli

SG officials shouldn't get perks
Tuesday was a sad day for democracy
within UF Student Government. In that
night's meeting, the Student Senate voted to
keep giving top SG officials perks that are out
of reach for ordinary students. They also ille-gally moved several powers of the Senate to
the Unite-controlled executive branch, essen-
tially creating the new office of Student Body
Dictator.
The worst thing I saw wasn't even the out-
come of the meeting (which, mind you, was
pretty horrible). During a vote on the Parking
Decal Fairness Act, I saw one senator raise his
hand, voting to eliminate wasteful Student
Government perks. However, the Unite Party
member next to him pulled his hand down,
saying that he wasn't supposed to vote that
way. And when one of the majority's own
members stood up to present a compromise,
the Unite Party quickly cut off debate and
voted him down.
The Unite Party controls a massive su-
permajority of the Senate, which they use to
stifle debate and increase their own power.
And when a Unite senator actually tries to
vote with the minority, they are almost always
silenced and probably won't find their names
on the Unite Party slate again.
I urge the Senators of the Unite Party to
be brave and stand up for what they think is
right. It's time the Senate starts working for the
students instead of only working to keep the
majority in power.
Jonathan Ossip
3LS, Murphree Senator,
Orange and Blue Party LeaderSG should bring back New York Times
When I arrived on campus early Monday
morning, I immediately headed to the news-
paper dispensers near Turlington to get my
copy of The New York Times. They only held
copies of USA Today. I assumed that particu-
lar dispenser was simply out of The New York
Times, so I checked the one near Library West.
Again, only USA Today.
I know I'm not the only one on campus
who considers the free copy of The New York
Times to be the highlight of the day. In the
past, copies of The New York Times usually
run out by 11 a.m. at the latest, while copies
of USA Today remain in the stands late into
the evening.
The New York Times is an internationally
respected, educational newspaper, while USA
Today focuses on gossip and dumbs down
the news it does cover. The fact that copies of
The New York Times have been snapped up
so quickly shows that other people on campus
agree with this assessment.
Student Government should bring back
The New York Times. If budget cuts are forc-
ing them to drop one paper, they should drop
USA Today instead.
I miss my paper.

Machen does not plan to relocate the annual UF-Ga. football game
MACHEN, from page 1
as adjusting summer pay rates.
Machen said he would have dealt
with the cuts differently if he had more
control over the budget.
"We still have an incredible state
bureaucracy that tells us how to spend
our money," he said.
For example, he said, in 2007-2008
when UF had to make $47 million in
cuts, the university was also given $62
million in Public Education Capital
Outlay, or PECO, funds designated for
building construction.
"If that had been a pot of money, I
wouldn't have done it that way," he
said. "I would've spent money on the
budget."
Asked about his negotiations with
Jacksonville to limit the availability of
alcohol during festivities at the annual
Florida-Georgia football game, Machen
said his safety concerns aren't enough
for him to lobby for a new location.
Later this fall, he said he plans to
announce an extension of the contract
that calls for the game to be held in
Jacksonville.
I /Alligator Staff He also responded to criticisms
from students, including Student BodyPresident Jordan Johnson, that he is
overstepping his role as president by
trying to regulate the drinking habits
of students during that weekend.
"I don't believe the safety of our
fans and students is outside the realm
of responsibility for a university," Ma-
chen said.
"What we're anxious to do is
get back into a hiring mode."
Bernie Machen
UF president
As for UF's drop in the party-school
rankings, he renewed his objection to
the rankings' validity but said many
people take them seriously, so he's
glad UF is no longer No. 1.
"I had parents ask me at Preview, 'Is
it safe for my son or daughter to come
to the University of Florida if all you
do up here is party?"' he said.
"You know that's not the truth," he
said. "Our kids work very hard, but
the perception is something we have to
deal with."
Discussing his recent trip to Indone-
sia, Machen said he would like to see
more students being traded betweenUF and Indonesian universities, but
acknowledged it might be a long shot.
"The problem is, it's so far and their
country is so poor," he said.
"They have good students, but
they can't afford to come to the U.S.,"
he said. "We're hopeful that the (U.S.)
State Department is gonna increase aid
to Indonesia."
Asked if he had any plans this year
to donate his bonus, assuming the
Board of Trustees approves it, Machen
said he hadn't made any plans yet.
"I don't make a decision until I have
something to decide," he said.
In December, Machen pledged to
donate his $285,000 to the Florida Op-
portunity Scholars Program, a scholar-
ship for low-income, first-generation
college students.
Earlier this month, football coach
Urban Meyer signed a new contract
that included a $1 million donation to
the program over six years.
Machen said if freshmen could learn
one thing by the time they leave here,
it should be "how to think and how the
world is not a simple little place, that
it's a big, complex world and they're
gonna have to be adaptive to be suc-
cessful."

Local pizza shops offer originality, culture to dining
By ALEX ORLANDO
avenue writer
With college students scarfing
down pizza faster than the average
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, the pizza
market is thriving in Gainesville.
Some go for the cheap, quick and
easy service at franchise pizza shops,
but others prefer to linger a while and
soak in the culture at Gainesville's in-
dependent pizzerias.
In the seaweed green, wood-frame
building on Northwest 13th Street, lo-
cals have been eating pizza on and off
for more than half a century. Duane's
Original Pizza Palace, first opened in
1953, has been serving people of all
dietary needs since it reopened under
new management in 2008.
"We're all mad about food," said
Duane Olson, owner and operator of
the Original Pizza Palace, affection-
ately known by locals as OPP.
With a mostly organic menu, many
of the ingredients for pizzas and break-fast items -including yogurt, jam,
granola, cheese and half and half -
are produced either locally or on site,
and OPP is set to handle most dietary
needs, according to Olson.
But food preference isn't the only
thing that OPP tries to accommodate.
The restaurant also strives to embody
the personality of Gainesville.
"It's very homey, but it's Gainesville
home-style," manager Ariel Koller-
Faloom said. "Earthy, crunchy, indie,
hipster, Gainesville home-style."
Even some of the menu items re-
flect the culture of the town.
"We serve Bageland bagels be-
cause it's old-school Gainesville,"
Olson said. "We get our food from
people we like."
Olson also showcases the town's
culture by displaying paintings, photos
and stained glass from local artists on
the walls. Local musicians and sing-
ers, such as Anna Marie and Friends
and Rashon Medlock, are invited to
perform in the restaurant three timesa week with music ranging from man-
dolin to pop.
Regulars Patt and Suzanne Crews
have been coming on dates to OPP
since the '70s. Suzanne remembers
eating there with her parents when
she was a kid.
"It was the only place to go back in
the day," she said.
It's no surprise that Patt and Su-
zanne also remember dining down the
street at Leonardo's Pizza on Univer-
sity Avenue.
"I'd like to think everyone who
grows up in Gainesville has been to
Leonardo's," owner Steve Solomon
said.
Both of the Crewses remember
eating Leonardo's Pizza since the res-
taurant opened in 1973 and said they
loved the Chicago-style pizza, chunky
tomatoes and pizza sauce.
"Killer sauce taste, that's what
Leo's is all about," Suzanne said.
But Solomon attributes more than
just sauce to the steady flow of cus-tomers. He said it's the serving size
and innovative ingredients that keeps
them coming back.
"When we came to Gainesville
[from Chicago], people sold pizza that
was round and you could only buy the
whole thing. We changed all that,"
Solomon said.
The pizzeria now serves pizza by
the slice baked in a brick oven and
in different shapes: square, triangle,
even heart-shaped on Valentine's
Day.
With toppings ranging from Thai
chicken and curry to gefilte fish with
matzo dough crust, Solomon said he
prides himself in keeping the menu
interesting.
"Kids grow up today with so much
corporate food in their diet," he said.
"You wonder if a person who works
at Domino's [Pizza] actually eats that
crap."
He said his refusal to give up qual-
ity of the pizza ingredients and person-
al interaction for timeliness is key. Heuses locally grown foods and selects
employees who will personally benefit
from working there.
Satchel's Pizza, 800 NE 23rd Ave.,
also plays to the college and commu-
nity's fun-loving and progressive over-
tones, owner and creator Satchel Raye
said.
He said he gets a mix of college
students and seniors, but mostly lo-
cal families, which is why business
doesn't slow down over summer.
Raye said the playgrounds and
novelty toy store, Lightnin' Salvage,
behind the restaurant tweaks that
childlike sense of fun.
"I think Gainesville's a very liberal
type of place," Raye said. "Being a
college town, it has a very progressive
feel.
It's this philosophy, along with the
college mindset, that has students
coming through the doors, despite its
out-of-the-way location, he said.
"What's a more quintessential col-
lege food than pizza?" Raye said.

Change of sc
By MEAGAN McGONE
avenue writer
Break up boredom in the bedroom.
A friend once said to me that being with the
same person for a while feels like eating chicken
for dinner every single night. Sure, she may think
about steak while she's at work. Sure, she may
contemplate giving in to her cravings for that en-
ticing slice of pizza after a drunken night at the
bars. At the end of the day though, she must
come home to that trusty piece of chicken.
All food references aside, the point is that sex
with the same person can get a little monotonous
after a while. The initial attraction and excitement
that boiled in the beginning is now down to a
simmer. You've already discovered every part ofenery, lingerie
each other's bodies, and you know exactly what
positions will get the job done.
Besides the whole obvious reproducing as-
pect, sex is meant to be passionate and fresh, a
way to communicate with your partner in a man-
ner that only the two of you can experience. How
much communication can happen in a two-min-
ute fit of thrustingthat ends in both of you turning
your separate ways and falling asleep?
Don't worry if this sounds all too familiar.
There are easy fixes, and the first one is called
Victoria's Secret.
For women, slipping into a racy outfit that
molds to your body and accentuates your curves
will bring out your most powerful weapon in bed-
confidence. Lingerie allows you to feel sexy and
present yourself to your man like a gift. Don't bespices up rem
intimidated by the hefty
purchase; the image
you'll leave in his mind
will be worth replacing a
few meals with Ramen
noodles.
If you want to go a
Meagan cheaper route, teasing is
a great way to spice upMcGone your sex life. Send her a
Columnist text while she's in class
detailing your favorite
parts of last night or give him a preview before he
goes to work of what he's going to get when he
comes home. The forbidden feeling will drive you
both crazy all day, making sex that much better
all night.tionships
Even a change of scenery is always nice; sex
does not need to be limited to the bed. Surprise
your partner byjumping into a shower together. If
you are sick of the bedroom, try the kitchen. Just
be sure to sanitize it after for your roommate's
sake.
Finally, let loose. Say what you are thinking
and do what you want to do. Role play, try dif-
ferent positions, and don't be afraid to get loud
and kinky. Even bring out some wine, as long as
the liquid courage doesn't result in a screaming
match or cry fest.
Consider sex as an art in which you can ex-
press yourself and just relax and let passion lead
the way.
After all, aren't there a thousand different
ways to cook a piece of chicken?

crowd of about 3,000.
Student Government Productions
is expecting costs of about $60,000 to
$70,000, a number that significantly
decreased after determiningthe band-
shell would reopen in time.
"We really lucked out because theBandshell was completed," said Aaron
Crespin, SGP chairman. "We didn't
have to provide
temporary staging
and we were able
to cut costs."
Citizen Cope,
who is set to re-
W lease an album in

known for his raspy voice and soothing
mix of jazz, R&B and hip-hop-a sound
completely different from The Whigs'garage band, punk-rock sound.
"We are expecting a very diverse,
very exciting crowd," said Jennifer Lett-
man, SGP spokeswoman.
To select the bands, SGP Chairman
Aaron Crespin said the organization
placed polls and questionnaires on
its Facebook group asking members
which bands they would like to see.
"We try to put on as many and as
diverse events as possible," said Cre-
spin. "The indie/alternative rock selec-
tion is hitting a certain genre."SGP spent the week promoting the
concert on campus in the Turlington
area and the Plaza of the Americas, as
well as at local venues such as Moth-
er's Pub & Grill and The Swamp Res-
taurant. It will continue promoting the
event tonight at 2nd Street Speakeasy
and Friday at Skyy.

Tucker Max scores in Gainesville
By ASHLEY ROSS
avenue writer
Raise your hand if you've slept
with a midget, a deaf girl and an am-
putee. Anyone? Oh yes, in the back of
the class, Mr. Tucker Max.
Max's movie, "I Hope They Serve
Beer in Hell," based on the New York
Times bestseller, premiered Monday
night at Gator Cinemas. Gainesville is
one of 31 stops on Max's movie pre-
miere tour before the film opens na-
tionwide on September 25.
But the premiere didn't just in-
clude a screening; it also included
a question-and-answer session with
Max and his co-writer, Nils Parker,
and swag bags for all viewers that
included a beer glass, movie poster,
bumper sticker, bottle opener key-
chain and wristband.
Max stopped in Gainesville just
after premiering the film in Tallahas-
see.
"Those FSU girls take it out of you,"
he said sipping out of a red Solo cup.
"They steal part of your soul."
Before the movie started, Max
asked audience members for their
best, most ludicrous sex stories.
Though there's no way to tell if they're
true or not, there was everything from
tag-teaming a girl in the back of a
hearse on Valentine's Day to a guy
who was caught losing his virginity by
his girlfriend's Amish father-
"How do you even spit game to
an Amish girl," Max asked. "I'll churn
your butter?"
Max's fame stems from his book,
a compilation of 27 ridiculous and
hilarious stories involving outrageous
amounts of alcohol, inappropriate ac-
tions and more sex "than is safe or
reasonable."But the book is only a small slice
of who Max really is; the movie shows
more.
The film follows Tucker (Matt
Czuchry, Gilmore Girls), Dan (Geoff
Stults, The Break-Up, Wedding Crash-
ers) and Drew (Jesse Bradford, Bring
it On, Swimfan) as they venture on an
impromptu bachelor party trip. Tucker
ends up dragging Dan into a lie with
his fianc6e and abandons his friends
to pursue a -let's just say, unique -
sexual interest and is forced to bal-
ance his selfish narcissism with what
it takes to be a true friend.
"The book is about being funny
and entertaining," Max said. "The
movie shows a different side of me,
how my personality traits impact my
friends."
While the movie does tell a great
story of three friends,
New it's jam-packed with
* nudity, raunchiness,
vulgar language, hilari-
ous dialogue and an
epic diarrhea scene.
The movie's humor is very simi-
lar to that of this summer's highest
grossing R-rated comedy,"The Hang-
over," but viewers on Monday said
they thought Max's movie was even
funnier. Stults was actually offered
Doug Bartha's role in "The Hangover,"
but turned it down for "I Hope They
Serve Beer in Hell."
Max thinks a big part of why the
movie works so well is because
Czuchry really nailed the character.
Big names like Wilder Valderrama
and Justin Timberlake were thrown
around for the part, but Czuchry truly
"channeled [Max's] oblique disregard
of other people's feelings" to master
the role.
In fact, Max said Czuchry createda more likable character out of Tucker
Max.
"He made me a better me," he
said. "I feel like he can take the char-
acter and go places where maybe I'm
not going to go in real life."
Although Max is known as a hor-
rible person who's mastered the art
of misogyny, he's not as much of a
douchebag as everyone thinks. Tuck-
er Max actually has a heart; he just
hasn't grown up. Yet.
"No question I want a wife and
kids. How [crappy] would it be to go
through your whole life single with no
one to love who loves you? I absolute-
ly want that, I just don't think today,
right now, I'm quite ready," he said.
And he is definitely not ready con-
sidering his first blog post after leav-
ing Gainesville was titled "I Scored in
the Swamp." The post described how
he snuck into Ben Hill Griffin Stadium
and had sex with a girl in the south
end zone underneath the national
championship signs. There are even
pictures to prove it.
His actions may seem disrespect-
ful, but Max has nothing but good
things to say about the Gators.
"To every other team in the SEC:
You are welcome to bask in the glow
of this score also, because it will prob-
ably be the only one any of us get on
UF this year."
Max, who graduated summa cum
laude from the University of Chicago
in 1998 and then went on to get his
JD from Duke Law School, is nearly
finished with his second book and
said he has plans for a sequel, which
would be set in law school.

First glance at
new Wonder-
land trailer
By JON SILMAN
avenue writer
At the intersection of expectation and reality you
can sometimes end up at disappointment street.
You can look forward to something so much that it
will never live up to the idea you had in your brain. A
shame, really.
I know you don't want to count your chickens
before they hatch, or your Cheshire cats or whatever,
but the trailer for the new Tim Burton film "Alice in
Wonderland" left me a bit underwhelmed. Before
you scream "off with my head" or any other "Alice"
colloquialism, understand this: I just don't want to be
let down again.
At first glance, the trailer looks enticing enough.
The mood set by the dark walk through the forest is
engaging, but the furniture looks fairly fake in the fall
through the rabbit hole.
Also, there are some hair issues. I'm no physics
major, but I'm pretty sure hair will fly upward as you
fall down. If this were any other director, it wouldn't
be a problem. But this is Tim Burton, the master of
the macabre, the gleeful ghost
of Gothic ghoulishness. The guy
brought us "The Nightmare Before
Christmas," a classic. I expect
more.
The checkered floor, the clear
liquid in the glass vial, it all seems
so ordinary, and so. expected.
It's as if I could close my eyes
Jon Silman and imagine the whole movie.
I don't want to do that. I want
to be shocked and breathless,
something that only a good trailer can do. I want to
salivate and be unable to contain my fervent desire.
In Burton's defense, he admits that the film is not
quite yet ready. In an interview with film site rotten-
tomatoes.com, he said, "I'll be working up until the
end. It's a weird process, because we're using so
many different techniques, it takes a very long time
to get to a finished shot, so I have very few finished
shots, if any. And it comes out in March. So there's a
lot of work to do, but a lot of it will come together at
the end. It's a bit scary, but it's exciting as well."
This brings up the question as to why the trailer is
out in the first place. Two years ago, the trailer for
"Iron Man" debuted at Comic-Con 2007 and created
an Internet sensation. I would have put off surgery to
see that movie. Was this a similar ploy? If it was, or
is, it's misguided to say the least.
Also, I am forced to deal with the sad, sobering
truth that a Johnny Depp movie does not mean a
good movie. Evidence: "Public Enemies." This movie
had everything going for it. Two of the world's biggest
movie stars, a real-life American outlaw story and the
director of "Heat," "Ali" and "The Aviator."
However, it stank worse than a nursing home with
a shortage of adult diapers. I was contemplating if
the theater stairs were enough to tumble me to my
death.
Bottom line: the trailer is lame, but I won't give up
hope. I honestly thought that "Pirates of the Carib-
bean" looked about as exciting as a math club get
together. But I was pleasantly surprised, blown away
really, at the sheer amount of awesome that was
packed into that movie.
So yes, I guess I do have a very important date to
keep. I just don't want to be disappointed.

job leads to guilty conscience
By ERIK VOSS
avenue writer
From the moment we're born, we're all
guilty of something.
As infants we were guilty of waking up
our parents at night, vomiting on their
clothes and forcing them to dispose of
our feces. Like drunk roommates.
Over time, guilt evolves. This summer,
for example, I worked as an intern for
my hometown's state attorney. After
spending a few months herding soci-
ety into two groups -"guilty" and "not
[yet] guilty" -some of the guilt rubbed
off on me.
My job was to track down people who
had written worthless checks and
scare them into paying them. I had to
read from a scriptfull ofavaguely threat-
ening words like "capias."
Capiases are the hall monitors of legal
citations: their bark is worse than their
bite.
Attorneys, much like the street gangs
they prosecute, wield words as weap-ons. Though while one group sprays
their lexicon in paint on railroad cars,
the other group's medium is an intern
with severe phone anxiety.
"Ma'am, I know the check was for only
$3.72," stuttered the arthritic arm of
the law, "but it's still a misdemeanor in
the state of Florida.
Please stop laugh-
ing."
As casual tourists
to the criminal un-
derworld, worth-
less check writers
belong to a rich cor-
nucopia of society.
These people enter battle armed with
a variety of excuses, sharing their per-
sonal drama with me as if I were their
manicurist.
"Sir, I strongly doubt the mailman has
been stealing our letters to you be-
cause he hates your Chihuahua."
"No ma'am, we haven't found the man
who made you write him a check atgunpoint."
"You probably shouldn't tell the state
attorney's office you needed moneyfor
marijuana."
Of course, many of the offenders were
good people who faced tough times
and needed cash for groceries or rent,
but it wasn't my job to discriminate -
only intimidate.
"We're gonna throw you behind bars,
Grandpa! Try sending your grand-
daughter birthday checks while Big
Bruce is checking your prostate in the
showers!"
In reality, I never worked up the cour-
age to call elderly offenders, worried
the discussion would result in another
addition to the "deceased" bin. I left
those files untouched, knowing they
would later be discovered by a more
ambitious and blood-thirsty intern who
would gladly yank the walker from that
poor old grandpa.
Maybe I should just write him a bad
check. At least then I'd feel less guilty.THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, 2009*4ALLIGATOR, 13

Layering creates new look for old clothing
By Lane Nieset
avenue editor
Ching-Ya Ni, 19, a UF sophomore,
masters the art of boho chic in this
fun and versatile school ensemble.
Her layered look adds new flair to
pieces found in her closet. Ni says
she doesn't follow trends, but she
can'twaitto pull out herfall clothing
this season. Try lookingthrough your
closet and pairing clothing together
in new ways to create a look for fall.
Adding colored tights underneath
flowing dresses or shorts takes a
summer look and transforms it for
the winter. Also, play with different
sizes of belts and boots to add a
little edge to the ensemble. Mix and
match different accessories that will
keep your outfits looking fresh for
the entire season.
Looking forward to most
about fall:
"Boots, boots, boots."
Favorite accessory to wear to
school:
hats, particularly berets
What she's wearing:
clothing from Forever 21, purse
from Urban Thread, an old mini
dress worn as a vest and a top that
is actually a skirt

LB Jenkins in boot
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator org
Freshman linebacker Jelani
Jenkins is wearing a protective
boot while he tries to recover
from a sprained left ankle he in-
jured in practice Tuesday.
Florida coach Urban Meyer
said Jenkins should return to
practice sometime next week.
Tough practices have taken
their toll on the UF linebacking
corps this fall. Brandon Hicks
is also fighting an ankle injury.
Jon Bostic has missed time with
an injury to his trapezius muscle
and Brendan Beal has been lim-
ited with a sore neck.
"We've been banging them
pretty good," Meyer said.
DEBOSE MAKING A PUSH: Fresh-
man wide receiver Andre Debose
is making a run at serious play-
ing time this fall after a strong
showing in preseason camp.
"He's got natural hands and
that 10.4 (second)-100-meter
speed, so he's blessed." Meyer
said.
Much like former Gators re-
ceiver Percy Harvin, early play-
ing time could come if Debose
shows he can be productive car-rying the ball.
STRIPES STILL ON: With a little
more than a week left before the
Sept. 5 season opener against
Charleston Southern, only five
freshmen have become full mem-
bers of the UF football family by
having the stripes removed from
their helmets.
Quarterback Jordan Reed,
running back Mike Gillislee,
linemen Jonotthan Harrison and
Nick Alajajian and receiver Ste-
phen Alli have had theirs taken
off.
"It's going to
be embarrassing
that first game
to have those
Football stripes," Meyer
said.
MOORE STILL OUT: Senior wide
receiver Carl Moore had a proce-
dure done last week to help al-
leviate back pain, but it appears
the injury was more severe than
coaches had anticipated.
"It's a little more significant
procedure than (we thought).
I'd give you the term, but I don't
know what it was. Something
about the nerves in his back,"
Meyer said. "It's still going to be

linebacker sprained his left ankle Tuesday and is expected to return to practice sometime next week.
PAY FOR PLAY
UAA committed to facilities
By LAURA KUBITZ, KYLE MAISTRI and
MIKE McCALL
Alligator Writers
Editor's Note: This is the conclusion of our
four-part alligatorSports series in which
we examine whether college athletes de-
serve to be paid for their athletic efforts.
An alternative to paying student-athletes is
to improve their athletic and educational expe-
rience in ways other than paying them.
"The UAA will continue to plan a strong
focus on facilities, as we believe they are one
of the strongest statements we can make about
our commitment to our athletic programs,"
the University Athletic Association said in its
budget.Completed in August 2008, the "Gateway
of Champions" project renovated, expanded
and created a new entrance into the football
office complex. A new banquet/video room
was created, and the strength and conditioning
complex was expanded.
In 2007-08, the UAA completed a renova-
tion of the Office of Student Life that enhanced
the staff offices and work areas. This renova-
tion will help provide academic assistance to
student-athletes.
The construction of a new facility to sup-
port women's lacrosse finished up this sum-
mer, and an audio-visual display to honor the
achievements of the UF men's basketball team
was added to its practice facility.
In 2008-09, there was also a budget increase
of $430,000 toward men and women's scholar-

hen it comes to a player'slegacy, perception is real-
ity.
Reality, however, is not always
perception.
Assuming Tim Tebow's senior
season is as least as productive as
his junior campaign, the three-year
starter will have done enough to go
down as the greatest player in col-
lege football history.
Tebow played his career in the
Southeastern Conference, a league
known for its stingy, NFL-style
defenses. Last season, the SEC fin-
ished with three teams in the top 10
in points allowed per game and six
teams in the top 21.
Tebow isn't racking up his stats
against Big 12 or Pac-10 foes. He
won a Heisman in a conference
where defense is king.
He is the conference's career
passing efficiency leader (173.8) and
is just seven rushing touchdownsfrom break-
ing Herschel
Walker's SEC
record 49 set
27 years ago.
In all like-
Kyle Maistri lihood, the
Kyle Points Golden Boy
krnaistri@a IIigator org will leave
Florida as the
career leader in both of those cat-
egories. It is football's equivalent to
a baseball player leading his confer-
ence in career home runs and stolen
bases.
He already has a Heisman Tro-
phy and two national champion-
ships to his name, one as a role
player and one as the star player.
When taking all that into ac-
count, I can't think of a single col-
lege football player with the type of
r6sum6 Tebow will be able to hand
to NFL scouts this spring.

Professor's study finds staying in school hurts athletes earning potential
PAY FOR PLAY, from page 21
ships. This number reflects the increase in tu-
ition, room and board and fees administered
by the university.
To help educate his players about the cur-
rent job market and how to manage money,
Urban Meyer set aside Tuesday night meet-
ings during spring practice to put the Gators
through informational sessions.
"One of the problems with college athlet-
ics is kids leave here and keep asking for their
Pell Grant checks and scholarship checks, and
that's going to stop," Meyer said. "You see so
many professional athletes blow their money
because they weren't taught. We're teaching
them right now.
"We've taken football time and taught
them how to go get a job and all the things this
university can do for you in the job market."
University of Vermont law professor Mi-
chael McCann has another solution.
"My argument would be that it isn't as
much that they deserve to be paid, but they
deserve the opportunity to go play pro sports,"
said McCann, who writes a column for Sports
Illustrated and helped represent former Ohio
State running back Maurice Clarett in his case
against the NFL.
"If they defy that opportunity and go to
college, that's their own decision. There are
benefits to doing either. I think in the NBA,
players should be able to go directly from high
school without a year off."
This opportunity would make college more
of a choice than a necessary stop en route to
the pros, McCann said, leaving less room to
gripe about compensation. Moreover, his 2004
study found that from 1995 to 2003, more than
80 percent of drafted high school players be-
came or will become multi-millionaires by the
age of 21.
The study also shows that these players
have maximized their earning potential by be-
coming unrestricted free agents by the age of
22, while graduating players will be bound bythe rookie salary scale.
He also broke down the myth that the lack
of a college education leads to more disciplin-
ary problems and showed "most players who
skip college may earn as much as $100 million
more over the course of their careers than if
they had done the 'smart thing' and earned a
college diploma."
While this system is unlikely to work with
college football, it would make the pay-for-
play argument less credible with basketball.
For football, Tampa sports talk radio host
and former Miami football player Dan Sileo
said student-athletes deserve the ability to test
the waters of the NFL Draft in a fashion simi-
lar to basketball players.
Currently, football players can ask a panel
to review and evaluate their
draft stock, but once they
declare for the draft, there's
no returning to college. Bas-
ketball players can declare
for the draft but retain col-
lege eligibility by not hiring
an agent.
Nelson And Florida receiver
David Nelson believes
there's value in not being paid. While he treats
playing football and taking classes as a job, he
doesn't see his predicament as a sob story.
"It is frustrating, but at the same time,
when you signed your scholarship, you came
to Florida to play football and be a student-
athlete," Nelson said. "You're supposed to be
a student-athlete, always go to class and give
100 percent to your studies and to football.
You have to get your mind right before you
come so you're ready for what's about to take
place."
Furthermore, Nelson fears that paying col-
lege athletes would take away from the spirit
of the game.
"If you add the paying component to it, it
takes away from the atmosphere and love that
makes up college football," he said. "You look
at the NFL, and it's a job and a business. It's
all about the individual and how much moneythey're getting. In college, it's all about doing
what you can for the team and the university.
"If you add that paying component in, it
takes away from the atmosphere and camara-
Top-Sellirderie we have between the team and student
body. People ask me all the time if we should
get paid, and I don't think so."

Yet, somehow, there are peo-
ple out there who think he needs
a second Heisman or a third na-
tional championship to secure
the sole spot atop college foot-
ball's Mount Olympus.
Reluctantly, I'm one of them.
The reality is that if Tebow only
earns a trip back to New York as
a Heisman finalist and loses in
the title game, there should be no
debate as to whether or not he is
the greatest ever.
His statistics, individual ac-
colades and team successes will
be greater than anyone who has
come before him, yet public opin-
ion won't see it that way -per-
ception will distort reality.
His legacy will be determined
based on one game against anelite team and a vote left in the
hands of former Heisman win-
ners and members of the media.
Any team, no matter how
good, can lose one game. And the
Heisman often goes to the best
player on the best team in the na-
tion rather than simply the best
player in the nation.
Unfairly, Tebow's legacy as
the greatest college football play-
er rests, in part, on the shoulders
of Brandon Spikes, Joe Haden,
Jeff Demps and the Pounceys.
It rests, in part, on the ballots
of Heisman voters who may notmost lucrative contract in the
NFL for doing little more than
winning a Super Bowl two years
ago. You know, because he did
that all by himself.
On the other hand, Donovan
McNabb, who has never been able
to get over the hump despite tak-
ing the Eagles to five NFC Cham-
pionship games in nine seasons,
routinely draws the ire of Eagles
fans and was almost run out of
town last year. You know, be-
cause he hasn't been able to win a
Super Bowl all by himself.
Even though he shouldn't
want another player to join Ar- need it, a second bronze statue

Moore caught 14 passes for 184 yards and a touchdown
last year but was expected to play a larger role this season
before injuring his back.
LOEFFLER DENIES WORKING WITH HADEN: Joe Haden and
Meyer have said that the Second-Team All-Southeastern
Conference defensive back will take snaps at quarterback
this fall as part of UF's Wildcat package.
But Wednesday, quarterbacks coach Scot Loeffler said he
has not worked with Haden at practice.
"I haven't had Joe in a team rep yet," Loeffler said.
