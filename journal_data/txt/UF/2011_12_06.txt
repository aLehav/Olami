  John Hendry was doing some 
last-minute research for a project 
about deforestation when the In-
ternet crashed.
  The 23-year-old environmen-
tal science senior was in the 
Student Recreation and Fitness 
Center when he experienced the campus-wide crash that started around 11:30 a.m. Monday. 
  Hendry said at ﬁ  rst he thought 
he may have violated one of the university’s Internet policies, causing him to be blocked from accessing the UF wireless net-work.
Dan Miller, network manager 
for UF’s Computing & Network-ing Services, wrote in an email that the outage started at 11:47 a.m. and lasted about an hour.
  CNS was notiﬁ  ed about the is-sue around 11:40 a.m. and imme-
diately began troubleshooting, 
he said.
  The cause of the outage has 
not yet been identiﬁ  ed, he said, 
but wireless access was restored 
after CNS rebooted UF’s authen-tication system.
  The outage affected all com-
puters connected to UF’s central 
wireless network, but Miller said 
computers in on-campus housing were not affected.
  Hendry said computers like 
those in Library West or the com-puter labs that were connected via Ethernet cable were still us-able, and after the problem was ﬁ  xed around 12:40 p.m., he was 
able to ﬁ  nish his project in time.
  An investigation into the 
cause of the problem is still on-
going, Miller said, but he said he believes it was a one-time inci-dent.

  Despite the convenience of online 
faculty evaluations, student response to 
these surveys has taken a dip since go-ing digital.
  Faculty evaluations, which UF offers 
solely online this semester, are open, but data from Summer 2011 indicates that student feedback decreased about 20 percent with the digital switch. 
  However, students who did com-
plete evaluations provided enhanced comments, and the online system saved the university time and money.
  The overall student response rate 
for Summer 2011, which was the ﬁ  rst 
semester students 
submitted all faculty evaluations online, was about 33 percent. When students com-pleted all evaluations on paper in Summer 2010, the overall re-sponse rate was about 
53 percent, said Donna Johnson, UF evaluations coordinator. Fewer students completing

  President Bernie Machen will stick with 
The Gator Nation a year longer than he planned, but he won’t get paid more for it.
  The UF Board of Trustees voted last week 
to extend Machen’s contract by one year, from Dec. 31, 2012, to Dec. 31, 2013.
  Chairman Carlos Alfonso said the board 
requested the extension so Machen could see through some of his own initiatives, par-ticularly Florida Tomorrow, a capital-raising campaign for UF. 
  He will not receive a raise for the extra 
year. 
  Machen’s salary is $432,808, according to a March 17 report from UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Insti-tutional Planning and Research. 
  “I don’t think that Bernie felt that in a 
time of austerity that he should be getting a raise, and neither did the board,” Alfonso said.
  This idea is in sharp contrast to the presi-
dents of many private universities, who have been taking raises despite the lingering recession. 
  The Chronicle of Higher Education, 
which recently published the salaries of 
top-earning private university presidents, reported that the highest-paid president in 2009 was Constantine N. Papadakis of Drexel University. Trustees extend Machen’s 
contract without salary raise

“I looked at it again and 
thought, ‘Why not try to find the owner? Nothing ventured, noth-ing gained,” Hill said.
Figueiredo, of Pembroke, 
Mass., was stunned the worn tag had weathered the long trip after the storm, which was made fa-mous by Sebastian Junger’s book 
“The Perfect Storm,” the basis for 
a Hollywood movie about a rug-ged crew of New England fisher -

“The odds are phenomenal,”

Dog steps on gun, shoots Utah 
hunter in buttocks
SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah 
bird hunter was shot in the but-tocks after his dog stepped on a shotgun laid across the bow of a boat.
Box Elder County Sheriff’s 
Deputy Kevin Potter says the 46-year-old Brigham City man was duck hunting with a friend when he climbed out of the boat to move decoys.
Potter says the man left his 
12-gauge shotgun in the boat and the dog stepped on it, causing it to fire. It wasn’t clear whether the safety on the gun was on at the time.
Potter says the man was hit 
from about 10 feet away with 27 pellets of birdshot. He says the man wasn’t seriously injured, in part because he was wearing waders. The man was treated at a nearby hospital.

Papadakis was paid $4,912,127, a 
202-percent increase from the previ-
ous year.
Others in the top five were the 
presidents of Johns Hopkins Univer -
sity, University of the Pacific, North-western University and Vanderbilt University, whose salaries ranged from $1.89 million to $3.82 million.
Nicholas S. Zeppos of Vanderbilt 
University was the only president in the top 10 earners who took a pay cut from 2008 to 2009. His salary de-creased by 21 percent.
The Chronicle’s survey of presiden-
tial pay at 482 private colleges, using federal tax returns, found the median compensation was $385,909, a 2.2-per -cent increase from 2008 to 2009.
The highest-paid public univer -
sity president is E. Gordon Lee of Ohio State University, who was paid 
$1,323,911 for the 2009-2010 academic 
year.
This is a steep step up from the 
next four highest earners from the University of Texas system, Univer -
sity of Texas at Austin, the Univer -
sity of Michigan system and Univer -
sity of Utah, whose salaries are in the $700,000 range. 
Although his salary is not in the 
top 10, “President Machen makes a very competitive wage for what he’s responsible for,” UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said.

First-year coach Samantha Sarff, 24, decided the water was too low at Newnans Lake on 
Thursday morning for the Florida Crew team to practice rowing. She said the time team members spend on the water can make or break them in the race held in spring. 
� MUD AND LOW WATER LEVELS 
MAKE PRACTICING AT NEWNANS LAKE DIFFICULT.
MAGGIE POWERS 
Alligator Contributing Writer
While some UF students were up to 
their necks in schoolwork this weekend, 
Florida Crew members were up to their chests in mud. 
The crew team spent six hours Saturday 
building an estimated 100-foot addition to the existing dock at Newnans Lake.
The team has not been able to effectively 
practice because the receding water level has left the lake thick with mud.
Team members are waiting on approval 
to move their practices to Lake Wauburg, a request they expressed in a written pro-posal to RecSports.
Krystina Sarff, coach of the women’s 
novice team, said the new dock is a tempo-rary fix.
All semester, the crew team has been 
battling with the mud in Newnans Lake.
It usually takes 20 minutes just to navi-
gate through the muck to the water where the team can practice, said Samantha Sarff, female novice assistant coach. Other times, they must complete their cardiovascular exercises and strength training on land. 
During the past summer, rowers no-
ticed the receding water levels, said club president Haley Vinson, 22, an exercise physiology senior.
Each boat costs about $35,000, Vinson 
said, “so that fact that we’re putting that in only a few inches of water is really damag-ing.”
Krystina and Samantha Sarff wrote 
and sent a proposal to RecSports for a new practice lake.
Eric Ascher, RecSports coordinator of 
competitive sports, said the proposal must be revised and presented by students on the team as opposed to the coaches to be considered for approval. Ascher declined to comment on these specific revisions. 
Shortly afterward, the student executive 
officers of the team took over the proposal process, Ascher said. 
“I want to try to help them accomplish 
what they want within the parameters that I have,” Ascher said. 
The crew team should receive an answer 
by the end of the semester, Ascher said.
Samantha Sarff said she is hoping for 
the best.
“I don’t care how it gets done,” she said.

Craig Fisher’s parents planned ahead.
The 18-year-old aerospace engineering 
freshman is about to complete his first semes-ter at UF, and thanks to two merit-based schol-arships and money set aside by his parents, he 
shouldn’t have to take out any loans to fund 
his undergraduate degree.
Fisher doesn’t qualify for need-based fi-
nancial aid programs like Federal Pell Grants or Florida Opportunity Scholarships. But if his parents hadn’t started saving early , he said, he would likely graduate in debt.
He’s not alone. Of the 50,844 students en-
rolled at UF in the 2009-2010 school year, 9,573 
received Pell Grants and 1,358 received Flor -
ida Opportunity Scholarships. Though about 
70 percent of UF students receive a scholar -
ship of some kind, the vast majority of these are non-need-based.
According to recent numbers released by 
College Board, U.S. colleges are giving out about $5.3 billion this year to students whose families don’t qualify for financial aid.
Critics, including College Board analyst 
Sandy Baum, say this indicates colleges are giving money to students who don’t need it. And as tuition continues to rise and grants and scholarship programs to fall, that $5.3 billion is 
becoming a point of controversy.
Instead of being need-based, this money is 
merit-based and is typically awarded to stu-
dents based on academic or extracurricular achievements in high school.
At UF, these merit scholarship programs 
include Bright Futures, National Merit and Lombardi scholarships.
For the 2009-2010 school year, 26,712 UF 
students qualified for Bright Futures scholar -
ships, receiving a total of $77,250,681 in aid.The National Merit scholarship program 
awarded $1,811,646 to 797 students, and there were nine Lombardi scholars who received 
$8,177 in aid for the year.
Rebecca Johnson, assis-
tant director of admissions at UF and the merit-based scholarship coordinator, said in an email that these types of scholarship pro-
grams can have a variety of uses.
Some schools implement 
them to recognize top academic students, she said, while others use them as recruiting mech-anisms to attract the best and the brightest.
Highly selective universities like Harvard 
and Yale, for example, give grants to families with incomes as high as $200,000 a year, the 
College Board report indicated.
Many students who qualify for merit-based scholarships like Bright Futures or Na-tional Merit may also qualify for need-based 
aid, Johnson said. This makes it almost impos-sible to determine how many UF students are receiving merit-based aid who would not oth-erwise qualify for assistance.
Michelle Novoa, a 19-year-old biology 
freshman, said she thinks merit should play a larger role in financial aid.
“There are a lot of people on the border -
line,” she said. “People who don’t qualify for need-based aid but can’t really afford to pay for college themselves.”
Fisher suggested merit-based scholarship 
programs institute an income cap so students who come from wealthy families would not qualify but middle-class students would.
“But if a person is bright, they shouldn’t 
be punished by losing out on scholarship op-
portunities,” he said, “College is expensive for 
everyone.”
As tuition rises, merit-based scholarships come under scrutiny
SAlAry , from page 1Machen’s pay not in top 10 
highest presidents’ salariesUF saved $320,000 on professor 
evaluations during the summer
“The response rates have dropped, but it 
was not unexpected,” Johnson said. “That has 
been the experience of other universities that have gone online.”
Although there has been a drop in student 
response rates, Johnson said the electronic word counts are significantly higher than the written word counts because students have more time to consider their responses. Moreover, students complete evaluations at their own convenience, she said.
Because of the online system, UF saved a 
total of $320,000 during the summer of 2011 and an average of 89 hours administering and 
logging evaluations per department, Johnson 
said. 
Despite the benefits, UF faced a challenge 
this semester in increasing student response rates.
Barbara Gross Davis, author of “Tools for 
Teaching,” a book that assesses the importance of student feedback, said universities across the nation are putting an emphasis on evalua-tions due to current scrutiny and concern about higher education. 
“The public is concerned about the costs of 
higher education, the value of higher education and the quality of higher education,” Davis said. 
Regardless of how proactive UF is in relay-
ing to students the weight of evaluations, the digital switch places the responsibility on stu-dents, Johnson said.
“We are now depending on students to be-
lieve in the importance of evaluations and con-tribute to the process,” she said.evAluAtionS , from page 1

The Southern Scholarship 
Foundation, which has eight  
houses in Gainesville to lodge scholarship recipients, is opening 
a ninth house.
The new house, which pro-
vides 21 housing scholarships 
and has several female spots 
available for the spring semester, 
is located on Southwest Ninth 
Street, near other SSF houses.
Jamie Chute is looking for -
ward to the annual Christmas morning re-enactment Thursday 
at Badcock Scholarship House, 
one of the nine houses.
“I love Christmas with Bad-
cock,” said Chute, 19, an Eng-
lish sophomore. “We do Secret Santa, put gifts under our tree, and we’re gonna open them all together. It’s a tradition.” 
At the houses, each resident 
pays, on average, a $950 food and services bill. This provides food, utilities, cable, Internet and 
activities for one semester. Each 
scholarship is valued at more than $7,000 each year.
In a SSF house, each resident 
has a roommate and shares a 
bathroom with four to six house-
mates. Chores are shared.
“For a few hours each week 
of cooking or cleaning, you get 
a warm, cozy place to live,” said 
Teresa Turner, director of stu-dent affairs.

Dan Walker always meant to 
stop in at the hospital for lunch, 
but work got in the way.
When he was finally in the 
area, the contract management 
coordinator for the UF architec-
ture and engineering department 
made it a point to grab lunch. 
Within minutes, everything on 
his plate was gone: the chicken, 
the creamed spinach and even the Brussels sprouts. 
“I’ve heard through word-
of-mouth that the food was aw-
ful good,” he said. “Of course, I 
don’t hope to be at the hospital, but if I am, I’ll eat here.”
Morrison Healthcare Food 
Services took over food services at Shands last year. On Dec. 14, 
the hospital will unveil a remod-
eled cafeteria area, including a 
sushi bar and brick-oven pizza 
area.
The project will cost $2.5 mil-
lion, including a second phase opening in mid-January, said re-tail manager Richard Bouvier.
John Tibbetts, director of food 
and nutrition services at Shands, said the hospital has been com-
mitted to creating a healthier 
menu that increases fiber while 
limiting fat and sodium. 
“The goal of the menu is to 
provide great-tasting, attractive-ly presented, healthy food in an 
environmentally conscious man-ner,” he said. 
Morrison works with dieti-
tians, chefs and test kitchens to 
create a base menu of tradition-
al favorites, mixing in diverse 
choices like ropa vieja and tilapia 
with roasted cherry tomatoes.“Each year, the traditional 
comfort foods like meatloaf and fried chicken act as a base and are surrounded by new and sea-sonal items,” Tibbetts said.
Consideration of regional is-
sues is critical in menu customi-
zation, Tibbetts said. After all, 
Morrison is owned by Compass 
Group, a $9.8-billion company 
that spans 44 states and about 98 
countries. 
With Shands’ location in a col-
lege town, Tibbetts said environ-mental issues are a big concern. 
Recently, Morrison has been con-centrating on sustainability and 
buying locally when possible.
“Morrison menus have fo-
cused on more sustainable sea-food, cage-free eggs, hormone-
free dairy and biodegradable 
packaging,” Tibbetts said.  
He said patient satisfaction 
at a reasonable price is the main 
goal of hospital nutrition ser -
vices. 
“We look at everyone as a cus-
tomer,” he said.Shands cafeteria gets makeover

Thank you to the

Every semester, about 50 students come together to put 
out a daily newspaper for UF students.
They spend their days talking with other students 
and professors, playing phone tag with each other and sacri-ficing their evenings and social lives to sit in an ancient office building using even older computers so you have something to grab out of the orange bins on campus every day.
It’s not always a glamorous job, and it doesn’t always earn 
us new friends, but it is a special experience for everyone who has ever had the opportunity to enter the newsroom.
It is hard for me to remember what it is like to eat dinner at 
a normal time. The concept of doing homework before the day 
it is due will probably always be foreign to me.
Luckily, I will be graduating and won’t have to spend my 
last semester at UF Alligator-less. I’m not sure what I would do 
with all the free time, and I’d have a hard time staying away 
from the newsroom, where I’ve spent more than 40 hours a 
week with great people for the last two years.
Whenever I look back on my time at UF, I will think about 
the Alligator and the hours I spent sitting in creaky rolling chairs, helping reporting students get their stories just right or 
looking up the day’s weather to put on page two.
I’ll think about the Secret Santa gift exchanges the staff does 
every year and how we always take turns calling in orders for 
Chinese food. That is what will define my college experience, 
and that is what helped prepare me for my career.
I won’t waste your time thanking my goldfish and my sec-
ond cousins for supporting me as I worked my way to the posi-
tion of editor-in-chief. The important people in my life already know how much I appreciate them for listening to my crazed 
rants about having to cover Student Government meetings and 
for letting me leave holiday dinners early so I could come back to budget the newspaper.
But I do want to leave you thinking about the time, energy 
and GPA points the hardworking students who produce this newspaper put into it.
For you, it might just be an opportunity to make a stupid 
comment on the website or serve as a distraction from your early-morning psychology class. But for those 50 or so staffers, 
it literally is a home away from home. (There are five couches 
in our office, and we’ve all taken a nap on them at least once.)
We all came together with the common goals of serving the 
public, building portfolios and learning how to be good jour -
nalists, but we go home every night excited to come back and work together the next day.
We work here to serve you, but at the end of the day we go 
home doing something we love.

Spend time with friends, family this season
If you’ve been following my columns throughout the se-
mester, you probably know how much of a sap I am. I will be the first person to cry at a commercial involving 
soldiers and/or animals. 
Before you ask, yes, I’ve seen that YouTube video of the 
dog greeting his returning-soldier owner, and yes, I cried at that, too.
What’s nice about this season, in addition to Starbucks’ 
delicious, syrupy drinks, is what the holidays do for all of us.
There are plenty of jokes about strained family get-togeth-
ers and about being alone during this season, but I choose to ignore them. The holidays are a chance for us to appreciate and recognize those who make our lives a little happier.
I was speaking with a friend last week about relationships 
and friendships. She reminded me that friends are people who make your life better. Real friends won’t intentionally make your life worse — and if they do, it’s time to let them go. 
We then decided we are really good at giving advice, 
so we started a blog about it. It is the cool thing to do these days.
What some people don’t like about holidays in general is 
that they remind us about the things we should be doing all of the time. Isn’t it a little sad that we need to have a Mother’s Day and a Father’s Day to make us tell our parents that we appreciate all they do for us? Do we really need a Valentine’s Day for us to tell our significant others that we love them?
Holidays have become a time for us to reconnect with 
friends. We get really busy in our lives. You are reading this during finals week, after all. More specifically, you’re read-ing this on the day that I have an eight-page-minimum paper due, so I know what busy feels like. 
So, maybe the holidays are based on the education system 
in this country: The two big breaks for Thanksgiving and the winter holidays  give us all a breather.
We become so stressed during the school year — or “work year” for you professional types — that we forget to appreci-ate our friends and family. It’s re-ally easy to take relationships for granted because there are simply a million other things to do and think about.
Making friends isn’t always 
easy, and I think it only gets hard-er as we get older. This year espe-
cially , I’ve started working on the quality of my relationships rather than the quantity . It’s more important to me to have long-lasting bonds with people than to have a high number of friends on my Facebook profile. Why? Because I realized I’m practically a functioning adult now.
I’ll wait for you to stop laughing because I can hardly be-
lieve it either.
But really, think of your favorite sitcom characters and 
their best friends. They’re pretty much all people that they met either during college or after they graduated. 
Now think about your best friends. Are those the same 
people you want to hang out with in a decade? That’s how I’ve been approaching this semester.
Now that this semester is coming to a close and my brain 
is five pounds heavier from writing/studying/thinking about where I’ll move after college, I’ve been cultivating the important friendships in my life. I suggest you do the same. Because while enjoying a party with a large group of people is one thing, it’s not imperative to the bigger picture of your life. 
College is the final steppingstone between adolescence 
and real adulthood, so use it wisely . Learn a lot — about scholarly knowledge and about yourself. Use this holiday break to your advantage and grow a little closer to your friends.

It’s been a fun 65 years, but the Pax Europa is on its way 
out. The sovereign debt crisis has put so much strain on the European Union that the system of cooperative con-
federacy that has prevailed since Wold War II has been hope-
lessly compromised.
There were good times to be sure. If you were really lucky, 
you got to bunga bunga alongside Silvio Berlusconi as Rome’s 
economy burned. But the years of cheap credit, flash-frozen by the mortgage crisis across the pond, have left an irrecon-
cilable divide between the creditors and the debtors. Now 
the eurozone faces an existential crisis as all involved decide whether the union can be saved. 
As leaders from creditor nations scramble to create a com-
bination of fiscal integration and austerity that could possibly save the common currency, the member nations are left with two unsavory options: fracture the eurozone or preserve the union at the cost of individual sovereignty.
This current crisis epitomizes what critics of European 
economic integration feared. A liberal flow of credit was the peace dividend of continental stability and growth. 
This easy money, alongside the consequent housing bub-
ble, allowed Greece and others to finance luxurious social programs and high wages. Tax evasion became widespread. When the music stopped during the financial crisis of 2008, countries in crisis had no way to adapt their economy to the 
new situation. Traditionally, a nation could simply inflate its 
way into financial competence or devalue its currency to spur exports. Painful solutions, but ones that could rescue a na-tion’s finances. Due to the common currency, though, these debtor nations had no such options.
Now, they must rely on the generosity of more financially stable members to prevent defaults. French and German leaders have attempted to create packages that will bail out these countries out in-
cluding, but not limited to, an Inter -
national Monetary Fund loan package. A package like this in 
some form is ultimately the only way to save the economic union, and it needs to be passed quickly.
However, on both sides of the solution, parties are highly 
uneasy. Debtor nations fear the economic reorganization that will be required by whatever organization ends up rescuing them. The IMF, that symbol of post-World War II global coop-eration, is notorious for mandating unpopular political and 
economic reforms as a condition of its funding. Similarly, any 
package that goes through the EU will likely require those countries to submit their budgets for approval by the body. Any solution that involves a bailout will almost, by definition, 
infringe on individual nations’ sovereignty and bring every-
one closer to a one-Europe government.
Germany, the white knight to whom everyone is looking, 
is dragging its feet for other reasons. Still bearing the scars of 
the hyperinflation that occurred during the Weimar Republic, 
it is hesitant to take any steps that could lead to spiraling in-flation. A solution that is popular everywhere except in Ger -
many is to fund the bailouts through the release of eurobonds, 
thereby increasing the indebtedness of the entire union. Also, 
there is a fundamental sense of injustice among Germans, who are indignant about being forced to subsidize other na-tions’ profligacy.
As a result of these aversions to the solutions that would 
save the eurozone, many expect the common currency to frac-ture or dissolve. The fears of being dragged into an inflation spiral could bring Germany and other like-minded countries to withdraw from the euro and create a new currency, or the fears of being subjugated to the demands of the rest of the 
continent would encouraged some debtor countries to with-
draw and manipulate a new currency to sacrifice economic strength for political sovereignty.
Whichever way it happens, changing the membership 
composition of the euro would have devastating economic 
consequences. Depending on the way creditor nations go, 
the euro could either skyrocket or plummet in value, which would have massive consequences on the foreign exchange and would add a whole new level of volatility that would 
constrict worldwide capital flows. A new global recession 
would be almost inevitable.
So now, the eurozone faces a critical decision. Is it worth a 
further consolidation of continental governance and the cor -
responding escalated economic interdependency to save the union? From a world markets standpoint — yes. In fact, an auction of German bonds last week left more than a third of the offering unsold, demonstrating that the market is losing 
its confidence in even the strongest of European economies. 
But the prospects of building a lifeboat before the currency sinks into the sea dwindle by the day. Even if a solution is passed and accepted, the members of the eurozone will find 
themselves even more hopelessly intertwined and further on 
the road toward centralized governance from Brussels.
The Greeks brought democracy into this world. It looks 
like they can help to take it out, too.

It was a decline that we could finally get 
excited about. After months of hovering at or near 9 percent, the unemployment 
rate finally dropped to a much-improved, al-beit still unhealthy, 8.6 percent — the lowest 
since March 2009. With 120,000 jobs added 
to the economy in November, politicians fi-nally have some positive news to trumpet.
For the most part, though, they didn’t. The silence says more than any canned 
stump speech could. For all the campaign talk of wanting to fix the economy first and foremost, it’s pretty apparent that this isn’t quite the news many were hoping for. Some 
simply do not want the unemployment rate to go down. For a sizeable amount of our 
elected officials and aspirants, the economy is important primarily in terms of its effect on their electoral chances.
And for an out-of-power party, the best 
thing that can seemingly happen in an elec-tion is sometimes the worst that can happen for the country. The lingeringly high unem-ployment helped John Boehner and the gang take the House last year, just as the financial meltdown of 2008 propelled President Ba-rack Obama to electoral victory. 
But there’s a difference between ben-
efiting from the side effects of failure and 
actively seeking to obstruct progress and wreak havoc. In 
recent years, and especially since Obama took of-fice, politics has 
shifted toward the mentality that the entire nation’s loss is one party or candidate’s gain. And more importantly, politicians have be-come all too aware that they don’t have to leave failure up to chance; they can make it happen themselves.
What we need to realize is that we can 
make things happen, too. Some politicians will always put their own interests ahead of 
their constituents’ — it’s just the nature of the game. But that’s only because we allow 
it. We have the power and responsibility to 
change things for the good of the country. 
The best way to do that is not on the streets but at the ballot box, where the fates of so many candidates lie at our fingertips. 
These past few years, it has become clear 
that a politician’s top priority is to keep his or her job. We can and should take advantage of that and hold accountable anyone who ig-nores the 13.3 million jobless in this country. 
Ultimately, the voters are the bosses.

A former Gainesville man 
who fled Florida in 2009 after he 
was identified as a top cocaine trafficker was arrested in Rhode Island early Monday morning. 
U.S. Marshals arrested Mario 
Ginorio, 30, in Coventry, R.I., ac-cording to a U.S. Marshals news release. 
Marshals said he had a .357 
Magnum handgun when he was arrested at his home. 
Ginorio was wanted by the 
Levy County Sheriff’s Office on 
a February arrest warrant for the 
trafficking and sale of cocaine. 
The warrant was the result 
of a 2008 investigation by fed-eral drug agents and the Levy County Sheriff’s Office that led to the arrest and prosecution of more than 25 people on cocaine-
related charges, according to the 
news release. 
The investigation revealed 
that Ginorio had supplied cocaine to peo-ple in Alachua, 
Levy and Dixie counties. 
Investiga-
tors learned that Ginorio had fled Florida 
and headed to Tennessee before moving to Rhode Island earlier this year, according to the re-lease. 
Deputy U.S. Marshal Bryon 
Carroll said Ginorio was taken to the Cranston, Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institution but will be extradited to Levy County to face his charges.Feds arrest Gainesville

In honor of its five-year anniversary , the Office of 
Sustainability released a report highlighting the ef-
forts it has made in creating a more sustainable UF.
“It highlights the department’s accomplish-
ments,” said Stephanie Sims, Office of Sustainability 
implementation coordinator. 
The office’s two biggest goals are to have zero 
waste at UF by 2015 and for UF to be carbon-neutral 
by 2025, Sims said. 
UF is trying to save energy despite having more 
square footage, she said.
UF’s electricity bill is about $43 million per year, 
and building energy is the largest component of UF’s greenhouse gas emissions. General electricity 
makes up 50 percent of gas emissions, according to 
the report. 
The office is working with UF to group occupied 
buildings together during summer session to ensure unused buildings aren’t wasting energy. 
Some actions that have already been implement-
ed include turning off lights, using more efficient air handlers, using the revolving door in Library West and upgrading windows, Sims said. 
By 2015, UF hopes to have zero waste. Outlined 
in the report are initiatives to achieve that, includ-ing encouraging fans to recycle when tailgating at home football games. About 145 tons of recyclables have been diverted since the TailGator Green Team Game-day Recycling program started in 2006. 
“A lot of major accomplishments are made, not 
just by our office but by hundreds of people in their own departments,” Sims said. 
Through various organizations, about 3,000 stu-
dents are involved with sustainability at UF. 
Gators Going Green, a Student Government 
agency for sustainability , was started three years ago to address the needs of the Student Body and establish environmental awareness. 
“We try to be a bridge between students, student 
organizations and UF,” said Brittnie Baker, director of Gators Going Green. 
Although UF is advanced in sustainability com-
pared to similar universities, before the formation of Gators Going Green it was lacking student involve-ment, said Baker, a 22-year-old political science se-nior. 
One event the agency co-hosted with the Office 
of Sustainability was a workshop teaching organiza-tions how to be more sustainable.
“We’re continuing to develop partnerships with 
offices throughout campus,” Sims said. “We want to reach out and get more students and faculty in-volved.”Sustainability office turns five

Florida sophomore forward Will Yeguete has started the last three games for Florida and has been 
productive on the boards, averaging nine rebounds per contest.
� THE SOPHOMORE HAS 
POSTED CAREER HIGHS IN POINTS, ASSISTS, STEALS AND MINUTES FOR UF.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
 
For the last 12 days, Will Yeguete 
has tried to be more than just a fill-in 
for a missing starter.
When 6-foot-10 forward Erik 
Murphy went down with a knee in-jury on Nov. 24, the 6-foot-7 Yeguete stepped up by posting career highs 
in points, assists, minutes and steals 
over the course of the Gators’ last three games.
Though he will likely lose his 
place in the starting rotation if Mur -
phy returns for Wednesday’s home game against Arizona, Yeguete’s contribution during his first career 
starts hasn’t been lost on his team-
mates.
“Last year we saw him do this a 
lot in practice,” senior guard Erving 
Walker said. “It’s just you had guys 
like V ernon (Macklin) and Alex (Tyus) there who kind of got more minutes than him, and it’s under -
standable. But Will’s just doing what 
we know he can do: the hustle plays, guarding, and things like that.”
Yeguete was already an effective 
rebounder when he came off the 
bench early this season, grabbing a 
rebound once every 3.6 minutes on 
the floor. 
But once he entered Florida’s 
starting frontcourt, his production jumped with 27 rebounds in his 
three starts — a board every 2.7 min-
utes he was on the court.
For the season, he averages a 
rebound every three minutes, the 
best mark on the team. Center Pat-
ric Young is second with one every 3.4 minutes and guard Brad Beal is third, with one every 4.8 minutes. 
“I’ve had to work on it a little bit 
like position-wise and (footwork-wise) and how to know actually how to go after the ball,” Yeguete said. “I guess I got better, and that’s 
the thing that I can bring every game 
and control, so I’m trying to do it ev-ery time.”
Coming into this season, Yeguete 
said he set few personal goals and 
was simply looking for more play-
ing time after averaging 7.1 minutes a game as a freshman. Against Syra-cuse last Friday , he saw a career-best 
31 minutes while turning in one of 
his most complete nights of the sea-son with 10 points, seven rebounds and four assists.
Yeguete was the only starter who 
did not commit a turnover, as the Or -
ange forced 20 of them in the Gators’ four-point loss. His two giveaways are the lowest among starters dur -
ing the last three games. Yeguete making most of time in No. 12 Florida’s starting lineup

The Gators’ already deep back-
court will be adding to its numbers 
next year after the official signing of 
three guards on Monday.
Leading UF’s 2012 recruiting class 
is 6-foot-1 Braxton Ogbueze, the No. 12 point guard in the nation, accord-ing to Rivals.com. The United Faith 
Christian Academy (N.C.) four-star recruit averaged 20 points and five assists per game as a junior.
“I’m excited about the guys that 
we’ve signed,” UF coach Billy Dono-van said. “I think that with losing Er -
ving (Walker), being a senior, Brax-
ton Ogbueze is a kid that’s as good as 
any point guard out there.”
Four-star guard Michael Frazier 
also signed with the Gators. The 6-foot-4 Tampa Montverde Academy Guard-heavy Gators add 
three to 2012 backcourtKELLY PRICE 
Alligator Writer
Four-star running back prospect Mike Da-
vis once said Florida’s biggest ailment on the 
field was its need for “bigger backs.”
Now, the Gators need to find one more.Davis, at 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds, would 
have been a much-needed ballcarrier at UF in the wake of the departures of seniors Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps. But after being orally committed to Florida since Feb. 19, Davis de-committed Sunday night.
Last Tuesday, tight ends coach Derek Lew-
is made an in-home visit to Davis in Stone Mountain, Ga. Davis said the meeting had gone “well,” and his decision to decommit 
had nothing to do with the visit, but “it was 
just something I noticed the next day.”
Citing a “misunderstanding” with coaches 
as the reason he chose to reopen his recruit-ment, Davis would not elaborate on the alter -
cation. On his Twitter he posted: “It’s funny when you look a coach in the eye [and] see 
right through the B.S. dey be feedin you.”
“Nothing really happened,” he said. “I 
can’t say because I don’t bash on coaches, but 
it was just a misunderstanding with me and the coaches.
“It wasn’t anything bad at all, it was just 
a misunderstanding with some things said and that hap-
pened. … There 
wasn’t nothing that 
sparked it. The thing that happened wasn’t supposed to happen.”
After he informed the Florida staff of 
his decision Monday, Davis said it empha-sized to him that the opportunity to play in RB Davis decommits from UF“When you start getting 
used to the game and get-
ting used to the system and 
the players, you feel more 
comfortable.”

rounds out 
this season’s 
Heisman Watch. 
Throughout the season he was 
considered by most to be the 
best NFL prospect in the nation, 
and while he didn’t post the 
gaudiest numbers he was still 
arguably the best player around 
and set a Stanford single-season 
record for passing touchdowns, eclipsing John Elway’s mark.The Honey Badger ﬁ  nishes fourth in our poll, 
but he doesn’t care. His electrifying perfor-mance in the Southeastern Conference Cham-pionship gave No. 1 LSU some much-needed life against Georgia. Although the Tigers did not record a ﬁ  rst down on offense in the ﬁ  rst half, 
Mathieu returned a punt 62 yards for a score in 
the second quarter to spark a 42-0 run for LSU. 
He added another highlight-reel return for 47 yards in the third quarter and also recovered a fumble in LSU’s 42-10 win.Richardson tumbles down to third this week, 
mostly because his Tide sat at home while other candidates left lasting images for voters. Still, Richardson had a Heisman-caliber season, and on Monday he earned a trip to New York for this weekend’s ceremony. Even if Richardson doesn’t take home Alabama’s second Heisman, he has a 
chance to hoist the crystal ball in New Orleans next month after Alabama earned a trip to the BCS title game to face LSU and the 
next candidate in our poll.RG3 takes home the stiff-arm trophy in our Heisman 
Watch this year, and it’s hard to argue he wasn’t the best player in college football this season. He completed 15 of 22 passes for 320 yards and two scores and added another two on the ground as Baylor doubled up Texas, 48-24. In the process of leading the Bears to their ﬁ  rst nine-win season since 
1986, Grifﬁ  n is on pace to break former Hawaii quarterback Colt Bren-nan’s single-season passing efﬁ  ciency record of 186.0 set in 2006.

MORE REBOUNDS, ASSISTS AND STEALS THAN LAST SEASON.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Writer
Senior guard Deana Allen 
reaps what she sows, and Florida 
is enjoying the harvest.
Allen is making the most of 
her time on the court, providing 
the Gators a much-needed boost 
off the bench.
Through seven games, Allen 
has achieved increases in average 
rebounds, assists and steals com-
pared with last season despite 
playing fewer minutes per game this year.
“I just try to maximize my 
minutes while I’m in,” Allen said. 
“I just try to find what’s working 
for me at the time and make that my strength.”
Allen averages 18.7 minutes 
per game, racking up 8.1 points 
and 2.6 steals per outing.
She is also tied for second on 
the team with 2.1 assists per game 
and ranks second on UF in re-
bounding with 5.9 per contest.
“Deana is just such an X-factor 
for us because she’s so hard to 
guard,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. 
“If you can successfully guard 
her, she’s probably going to get five or six rebounds before you know what happened.”
Allen’s role this season is 
much different than it was one 
year ago.
Transferring to UF from Pensa-
cola Junior College, Allen started 
18 of 35 games last season for But-ler’s mostly inexperienced squad, playing 19.2 minutes per contest.
Now Allen’s role is more de-
fined, and she understands her importance as the first player off the bench.
“It may not be my best night, but I still try to contribute (with) some form of energy and just mo-tivation to the girls,” Allen said. “Even if I’m not having a good game.”
In the season-opening 69-66 
loss to Michigan, Florida missed the enthusiasm of Allen, who sat out due to a concussion suffered in preseason practice.
The game featured 29 lead 
changes and 13 ties, but the Gators were unable to overcome disappointing performances on both sides of the ball.
“In no way is [Allen’s absence] 
an excuse for tonight’s lack of ex-ecution,” Butler said after the loss to the Wolverines.
However, since that game, 
Florida has executed much better.
UF went on a six-game win-
ning streak that included an up-set of then-No. 21 Florida State before losing to No. 11 Rutgers 63-49 on Friday.
“I can’t even tell her how much 
it means to have someone of her caliber to come off the bench and really be that spark plug,” redshirt senior guard Jordan Jones said. “She’s embraced it, and she’s do-ing a lot for this team right now.”
As the Gators prepare for 
their first two true road games of the season this week against San Francisco and Pacific, they will be relying on Allen for more than her efficiency.
Mainly, Butler appreciates 
how Allen senses the “urgency of the moment” when she’s out on the floor.
“She’s playing as hard as she 
possibly can,” Jones said. “I think she’s playing harder than anyone in the country right now, really.” TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida entered the NCAA tourna-
ment with the nation’s most efficient of-
fense, coming in as the only team with a hitting percentage above .300. 
After two victories in Cedar Falls, 
Iowa, last weekend, the Gators are head-ed to their seventh straight Sweet 16, and it appears not much has changed on the efficiency front. 
“We were able to find the open player 
and able to put the ball where we need-ed to in order to score,” senior outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel said after Saturday’s 3-1 victory against No. 6 seed Northern Iowa. 
In a season full of complete offensive 
performances, Florida put on two of its 
best displays inside the McLeod Center. 
After stumbling out of the gates Fri-
day in a first-set loss to Missouri, UF 
reeled off an impressive three-set run 
during which the Gators out-hit the 
Tigers .246 to .008. During the stretch, 
Florida committed 10 fewer attack er -rors than Missouri but still finished the match slightly above its season attack errors-per-set average of 4.03. 
The miscues were made up for by 
gaudy backcourt defensive numbers. The Gators average 13.4 digs-per-set on the year but averaged 20.5 on Friday night in a match that saw Jaeckel, senior set-ter and right-side hitter Kelly Murphy, 
freshman de-fensive special-ist Holly Pole and redshirt 
freshman libero Taylor Unroe all finish with double-digit digs, including 20 and 23 for Pole and Unroe, respectively. 
“Missouri is used to playing in a 
league with some really good liberos,” UF coach Mary Wise said. “So they’re used to keeping the ball in play. The ball 
doesn’t land easily.”
But Saturday night against Nothern 
Iowa, another 3-1 victory, it was all about 
what has been Florida’s strong point all year. After committing five attack errors 
and getting out-hit .295 to .100 in a first 
set dominated by UNI, unseeded UF fought back with a precise performance. 
The Gators out-hit the Panthers .358 
to .142 in the final three sets of the match 
and committed 19 fewer attack errors 
during that same span.
The effort was spearheaded by the 
usual cast of Jaeckel and Murphy, who 
combined for 28 kills, just one attack er -
ror and a .386 hitting clip. Murphy also 
added 20 assists, while Jaeckel posted another strong sideout mark for the Gators with four service aces. 
“Credit to our low error; when we 
didn’t have an opportunity to score, we tried to put pressure on them instead of taking a swing that could have been high error,” Jaeckel said. “We were keeping 
ourselves in the rally.”
On the season, opponents averaged 
just a .149 attack percentage against 
Northern Iowa, which finished its regu-lar season 32-1 and easily handled Ni-agara in the opening round. 
“The theme of [Saturday’s] match 
was: ‘Get UNI uncomfortable,’” Wise said.
 “We didn’t do a great job of that the 
first set, but as the match went on, I felt that we were able to put some pressure on them and get them uncomfortable.”UF offense continuing to shine in NCAAs 
Gainesville was still available if 
he ever changed his mind.
Now on his radar are Tennes-
see, South Carolina, Miami and Florida State.
“Some things might happen,” 
he said, indicating UF may still be in consideration.
Davis took his first official 
visit on Friday to Tennessee, and will be in Tallahassee on Dec. 16 for an official visit to Florida State. He also said he is arrang-ing plans for an official visit to 
South Carolina in the near fu-
ture.
Davis’ decommitment leaves 
the Gators with a single running back scheduled to sign on Na-tional Signing Day — four-star prospect Matt Jones of Seffner Armwood High — and 16 total commitments.
However, at the top of Flori-
da’s wish list has been running back Keith Marshall of Raleigh (N.C.) Millbrook High, the na-tion’s No. 1 back, according to Rivals.com. With his com-mitment set for this afternoon, Marshall will pick between UF and Georgia, among others, and 
possibly negate Florida’s fears of 
poor depth at running back.
Oral commitments are non-
binding until a national letter of intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 1, 2012.Top back to

Deana Allen
UF senior guardHe has also shown he is a valu-
able weapon at the front of Florida’s 
press, with seven of his nine steals 
coming in games he has started.
“I feel more comfortable because 
I’m playing more than last year, 
obviously ,” Yeguete said. “When 
you start getting used to the game 
and getting used to the system and the players, you feel more comfort-able.”
While Murphy’s return would 
mean a decrease in court time for Yeguete, he feels he can still contrib-ute. Murphy , known more for his 
3-point shooting and passing, had 
five rebounds or fewer in each of his four starts.
Murphy was expected to be back 
in practice Monday , according to Yeguete. 
“I hope [Murphy] comes back,” 
Yeguete said. “We’ll see if he comes back in the starting five, then I’ll 
have to go back to the bench. … I’ll 
[have to] stay consistent and just bring the same energy that I brought when I was in the first five.”

alligator.org.product scored 29.7 points and had 9.7 boards a 
game last season. He is joined by fellow shoot-
ing guard Dillion Graham, a three-star recruit from Orlando First Academy.
“Frazier is a phenomenal 3-point shooter 
and a guy that we’ve kept an eye on for a long, long time,” Donovan said. “Dillion Graham, 
another really talented perimeter player who’s 
got obviously range to shoot it and put it on the floor.”
Donovan said the Gators have addressed 
most of their needs, but he is still recruiting and could add more players to the class. 
Florida could use more depth in its front-
court. Despite his pedigree of sending big men such as Joakim Noah, Al Horford and David Lee to the NBA, Donovan hasn’t signed a top-100 big man since landing sophomore center 
Patric Young in 2009. 
“That’s part of it; that’s a selling point,” 
Donovan said of landing a big man. “That’s something that’s a positive but, at the end of 
the day, these kids take their four or five visits, they’re seeing things and it’s a lot more than 
just, ‘Well, there’s NBA guys at Florida.’
“Unfortunately in this, you get told, ‘no’ a 
lot more than you do, ‘yes.’”
No big Beal: Freshman Brad Beal’s shooting 
woes from three continued against Syracuse 
last Friday, as the 6-foot-3 guard went 0 for 5 
on 3-pointers.
Through seven games, Beal has been held to 
just one 3-pointer or fewer five times. 
Donovan compared Beal’s shooting early 
this season to the same struggles Kenny Boyn-
ton, Chandler Parsons and Lee Humphrey — 
UF’s all-time leader in made threes — experi-
enced in their first  years.
“When the speed of the game is totally dif-
ferent than it was in high school, there’s always a learning curve that you got to go through,” Donovan said. “So I’m not really worried about 
his shooting.”
Murphy set to play: After sitting out the 
last three games, junior forward Erik Murphy is poised to rejoin the starting lineup when No. 
12 Florida hosts Arizona on Wednesday.
The 6-foot-10 Murphy has been injured since 
Nov. 24 with a bone bruise in his right knee that he suffered during practice.
“He’s going to play,” Donovan said. “Right 
now, he’s been cleared. He worked out yester -
day on his own; he did some running. He’ll 
probably go through half the contact right now. 
Provided the next two days go as planned with him physically, he should be able to play.”
