STUDENT GOVERNMENT
By Melissa Gomez
Alligator Staff Writer
In Fletcher Hall, students wage war against 
green and black demons.
It’s on their clothes, hats and pillows. The 
fuzzy bits of mold devour books and slip be-
tween sheets.   
Donovan Kryak sleeps with them every 
night. The 20-year-old UF computer science sophomore moved into Fletcher in Fall.
“I’m essentially living in a petri dish,” he 
said. “It’s more than just a general nuisance. When it affects my health it actually gets in the way.”
Kryak’s said his housing fee is covered by 
Florida Prepaid, but he’s decided to move off-
campus after having to put up with the mold.
On May 1, he’ll move out of Fletcher Hall. 
And he’s counting down the days.
“I’m moving into an apartment because I 
just can’t deal with the on-campus stuff any-more,” he said.
UF Spokeswoman Janine Sikes said she 
couldn’t comment speciﬁ  cally on mold in Fletcher because she isn’t aware of the entire 
situation.
But she said UF deals with mold-type is-
sues in buildings across campus due to the university’s age and climate.
“We are one of the oldest campuses in 
Florida,” she said. “We do tend to have more of those kinds of issues than other universities or newer universities. 
The UF Physical Plant, iService and Envi-
ronmental Health and Safety are used to rem-edy the problem, she said.
Alexandra Nelson, a resident in Fletcher, 
deals with the mold herself. 
The 19-year-old UF biology sophomore 
said she’s found it behind her door, bed posts and her pillowcase.
“It’s really a lot of mold. I try to clean it as 
best as I can,” Nelson said.She said she doesn’t consider the mold a 
major issue, but two others on her ﬂ  oor have moved out.
“When you live in a dorm that’s this old, 
that’s just going to be a problem,” she said.  
Sharon Blansett, assistant to the associate 
vice president for Student Affairs, wrote in an email that 166 students live in Fletcher.
She said students with mold should submit 
an iService request. She declined to comment speciﬁ  cally about whether students have used the maintenance service for mold and what’s 
being done to prevent it.
Craig Ashmeade returned to his dorm after 
Winter Break to a bed covered in mold.
Ashmeade, who’s been living in Fletcher 
since Fall, has spent time washing his hats, 
sheets and pillowcases, the 21-year-old UF electrical engineering junior said.
“As far as living conditions go, it’s a big 
deal. No one likes mold in their room. It’s a 
little stressing,” he said.

Student voices were silenced at Tuesday 
night’s Senate meeting.
Students expressed disgust, frustration 
and anger when it came to Senate rejecting to hear the nominees for the UF Supreme Court.
More than 20 students spoke and spent 
more than an hour urging the Senate to hear the nominations after multiple motions failed 
to have them put on the agenda.
More than once, students were silenced 
with objections to extend their time.
But in the end, despite motions from 
Access senators, nominations for the court weren’t heard.
Sen. Kylie Werk (Impact, District A) led 
the con debate against hearing nominations.
UF SG Solicitor General Nicholas Gurney 
spoke during the Student Body president’s 
report, and he reminded the student senators they need to stick to UF’s constitution.
Nicholas Carre later gave his goodbye 
speech. He said he was fed up with the Sen-ate not hearing the Court nominations.
“It’s because of sickening decisions like 
this. The silencing of voices,” he said. “We like precedents right, so why not keep it that way?”
Student Body President-elect Susan Web-
ster’s nominees were also heard. Webster nominated Michael Greenberg, a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. It’s the 14th time in a row a member from the fraternity has been elected for ACCENT head.

preserve waterREDUCE YOUR SHOWERTIME
BY 2 MINUTESBy Caitlin Ostroff
Alligator Staff Writer
Regan Garner held a 4-foot-tall 
cutout of Rick Scott’s head on the 
Plaza of the Americas on Tuesday.
A piece of paper reading “this 
oppresses women” covered Scott’s forehead while about 75 people protested his signing of Florida 
House Bill 1411.
The bill revokes taxpayer fund-
ing for health clinics that provide 
abortions, including Planned Par-enthood.
Garner, a member of the steer-
ing committee for the Gainesville chapter of National Women’s Lib-eration, said she paid about $50 for the cut-out from Target Copy.
During the protest, demonstra-
tors held signs reading “Stop the War on Choice” and  “Not my clinic.” About seven people spoke about their experiences receiving 
abortions, birth control and other 
contraceptives from Planned Par-enthood.
Emily Calvin, a UF law student, 
wore a button reading “dues-pay-ing feminist.”
Calvin said she organized the 
demonstration to draw attention to the bill.
“This bill affects our choices 
and our autonomy and our free-dom,” the 28-year-old said. “This bill is a violation of our freedom.”
Women could visit other health 
care centers instead of going to nonproﬁ  ts such as Planned Parent-hood, Calvin said. However, such clinics do not provide abortions.
Florida is referring women in 
Alachua County to Azalea Health for dental care and Palms Medical Group for primary care.
Hazel Levy, a UF biology pro-
fessor, said the recommended clin-ics will not serve women’s needs.
“A Pap smear is not a gyneco-
logical exam,” she said. “(Scott’s) 
taking from these not-for-proﬁ  t 
clinics.”Across from NWL supporters, 
about 25 students with Catholic Gators stood in a semi-circle to 
pray.
Carol Buydos, a UF biology se-
nior, led the group in a rendition 
of Hail Mary.
Some held signs reading “Pray 
to end abortion,” while others held rosary beads.
“We’re here to pray for the 
souls of the children who won’t be 
born,” the 20-year-old said.
The Dean of Students Ofﬁ  ce, 
supported by the University Police, 
oversaw both protests.
Rosie Richeson, a regional orga-
nizer for Planned Parenthood, said Florida residents need to stand up to politicians.
“Their public image, that’s what they truly care about,” the 25-year-old said.  
Although the semester is com-
ing to an end, Calvin said she hopes students will continue pro-testing the bill.
The law goes into effect July 1, 
but the NWL is organizing a social media campaign in which women are asked to ﬁ  lm themselves being denied an abortion or other ser-vice.
Calvin said it’s important for 
women to have unrestricted access to health care.
“We want men to share equally 
in that responsibility, and that in-cludes Rick Scott,” she said.

The views expressed here are not necessarily those of the Alligator.Editorial
Column
To my Alligator family and our ramshackle home
Goodbyes have never been my strong 
suit.
I moved around a lot as a kid, so 
maybe I’ve just grown up dreading and knowing well the sinking feel-
ing in your stomach when you have to leave something you love. Saying goodbye implies 
loss, sadness, heartbreak.
As I look back on my time here through 
the cloudy windows of this dilapidated build-
ing, I can feel that pit in my stomach growing larger as the time approaches for me to turn toward the 
future and away from this little home our staff has built 
over the last few months.
Because truly, the staff does build the home. This 
building has been indisputably influential on genera-
tion after generation of Alligator alumni, and I can now 
count myself among those lucky ranks. But the most important part of any home is the family that inhabits it.
And maybe we are all a little bit heartbroken as we 
leave this place and turn toward our futures, be them graduation, other endeavors or further semesters at this newspaper. But we all have that sense of family to cling to.
I’ll never forget the nights I could have sworn my 
life was falling apart around me, and the Karma Cream cupcake hand-delivered from a coworker lifted my spirits enough to get me through the night. I’ll never forget the pride I felt for every writer who, after sleep-
less nights and unending hard work, pulled together an 
amazing story. I’ll never forget the laughs, the tears, the heartfelt thank-yous or the incredible satisfaction that comes from knowing, come hell or high water, 
we’re going to get this paper out if it kills us.
Journalism is hard. This job has been hard. This se-mester has been hard. Between an in-depth 
five-part series on sexual assault, tumultu-ous SG elections, the impending doom of 
graduation and whatever lies beyond it and 
the terrifying task of leading a newspaper and its staff to a new location, it’s been a wild ride to say the least. 
But I have had the most spectacular team 
to do it all with, and that I wouldn’t change for the world.
No one could have prepared me for the 
challenges ahead or the tough decisions I’d have to 
make. No one could have prepared me for the late 
nights, the constant stress, the toll that food delivery has taken on my bank account — or the incredible, inspiring friends I’ve made along the way.
Because this job has been hard, but it has been the 
most rewarding thing I’ve ever been a part of.
To the current Alligator staff: Know that I am eter-
nally grateful to and proud of each and every one of you, and I will miss you all with my whole heart.
I’ll miss this old building, too. 1105 W. University 
Ave. has been a second home for anyone who has set foot here, and the pitter-patter of rat paws hasn’t quite drowned out the sounds of laughter and memories con-
tained in these old, moldy walls.
But the Alligator is moving forward, and so am I. 
As scary as the future is, I know that I will carry the 
friendships, lessons and memories I’ve made here with me for the rest of my life.
And as I look back on the hard nights and the great 
ones, I can smile as I turn toward that scary future alongside all the people who have made the past some-thing worth missing.
Mary Grace Henley is the Alligator’s managing print 
editor and a graduating UF English senior.This is it, readers. Spring 2016: We did it — we did the 
thing. Many of you may still feel weary of the flurry of fi-nals and papers ahead. 
Don’t worry: We at the Alligator believe in you. And be-
sides, this time two weeks from now, the stress of this se-mester will be the last thing on your mind as you’re getting 
your Jackie tan on at the beach. But before you ghost out 
of Gainesville for good, enjoy our grand finale, our Wood-stock ’69, our latest edition of…
Darts & Laurels
Fans of Marvel’s god of thunder should be happy with 
actor and international heartthrob Chris Hemsworth’s ap-pearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Monday. Dur-
ing the interview, Hemsworth disclosed a cute story of how 
his 4-year-old daughter recently told him, “I want a penis!” Hemsworth beautifully responded she could be whatever she wants to be, so we extend a laurel to Chris Hems-
worth for his spot-on parenting.
Though, for those deeply invested in the Marvel uni-
verse, this story has far deeper implications. Thor already 
wields a dangerous weapon, but now his daughter wants one of her own? We at the Alligator encourage you to watch 
your back. Sure, it’s our movies and entertainment now, 
but who knows when these Asgardians will start coming for our jobs and freedom?
Speaking of unfounded xenophobia: Donald Trump. 
Normally we’d refrain from entertaining him in our es-teemed “Darts & Laurels” editions, but he had a gaffe like no other at his Buffalo, New York, rally Monday. In dis-cussing the World Trade Center with his audience, he said “I watched our police and our firemen down on 7/11.” Yes, 
you read that right: 7-Eleven. Now, was this likely an in-
nocent mix-up? Maybe… but maybe not.
How do we know? So much of what this man says is 
complete nonsense; we need to consider all possibilities. 
Was this corporate sponsorship? Subliminal messaging? Or 
maybe Trump’s been a machine this entire time, and he was secretly calling out for fuel because his bulls--- tank was running low. No matter; we give a dart to Trump’s mouth for all the hazardous waste it spews.
In Alligator news, we want to indulge the opinions sec-
tion a little bit, one writer in particular, who’s been writing for us ever since Fall 2013 and is now graduating: Michael Beato. While we obviously cannot approve or disapprove 
of his work professionally, we would like to extend him a 
laurel for the years of dedication to the paper and for pro-viding an example of what “sticking to your guns” really 
means. Thanks, man.
Lastly, we saved a laurel for a special group: you, the 
readers. When news broke that we were moving away from our 1105 W. University Ave. location, many of you showed concern for the paper’s well-being and continued to express support for the work we do and what we 
represent. 
So, for real, thank you all so much. Come by and see us 
at our new location, 2700 SW 13th St., starting this Sum-
mer.
For those of you traveling, interning or doing whatever 
out of town, come back in the Fall all the more experienced and cultured. 
And for the Summer A and C squad, we’ll see you on 
May 9! Stay classy, San Diego.

BERNIE SANDERS, Democrat
New job — College dining hall employeeThe only thing that makes eating in any 
college dining hall worthwhile is the cafeteria staff. Bernie would be the absolute perfect guy 
to lift my spirits before I go sit down and stare 
at my yogurt. Jolly, engaging, grandpa-like and full of “yuge” ideas, he’d motivate every trou-bled soul to keep on keepin’ on. Management would have to keep a close eye on him, howev-er. It won’t take long for him to start spreading talks of unions and workers’ compensation.
HILLARY CLINTON, DemocratNew job — Just… retire, OK?Please, hear me out. I happen to 
admire Hillary very much. But she has done so much in her lifetime: lawyer, senator, ﬁ  rst lady, secretary of state. The list goes on and on. 
What more does she owe us? It’s 
about time for her to relax, enjoy life and travel the world. If I lost the 2008 presidential race, I’d say “say-onara” to this messed up world of politics and “hello” to waking up at noon, banana-strawberry smoothies and daily Bernie Sanders meme art.
TED CRUZ, RepublicanNew job — Extra for “Alien 5”This would be absolutely perfect 
for Ted. He’s basically just an actor already; all he needs is a few lines. The real problem would be working 
in an English-only setting, because 
we wouldn’t want to make him self-conscious about his Spanish skills. Nevertheless, Ted could completely redeﬁ  ne the horror ﬁ  lm industry! And best of all, he wouldn’t need to 
wear makeup or a costume or anything. That would save big on taxpayer dollars.
DONALD TRUMP, RepublicanNew job — Basketball (not a player — the 
ball)
Yeah, it’s not really a job, but I think we 
can all agree that if he weren’t self-employed, Trump would be out of a job for the rest of 
his life. Is there anyone he hasn’t pissed off? 
As a basketball, though, he’d be putting his mind to really making America great again, one swoosh at a time. Plus, he’d make good on his claim that he has a “great relationship with the blacks.”

THE RENOVATION WILL COST A 
TOTAL OF ABOUT $16.5 MILLION.
By Katelyn Newberg
Alligator Staff Writer
Students tested furniture of different 
colors and styles for future Gators on Tues-
day.
About 200 students voted on nine differ-
ent seating options for Newell Hall, which is being renovated into a 24-hour student study center, said Anthony DeSantis, UF’s 
associate dean of students. 
Students ranked nine chairs and couch-
es based on comfort, style and functional-
ity and chose from three fabric designs for each piece of furniture.
Newell Hall will be completed in March 
2017, wrote Howie Ferguson, the build-ing’s project manager, in an email. The renovation will cost about $16.5 million, 
$13 million of which will be for construc-
tion, while the remaining money will cover furniture and inspection and design fees.
“Students have been part of this build-
ing since the renovation started,” DeSantis 
said. “If it’s not right for a student, then we 
don’t want to go with something like that.”
When complete, Newell Hall will have 
a modern interior within its historical ex-
terior, he said.
“It will kind of be like Google headquar-
ters’ downtown feel,” he said. “When you renovate an old building, you don’t want to lose the sense of where it came from.”
DeSantis said the results will be posted 
on the Dean of Students Office’s website 
after the paper ballots are tallied.
Parker Hoppens, a UF food and resource 
economics sophomore, said he enjoyed try-ing out different chairs but was lost when picking fabrics.
“I don’t know why they’re trusting stu-
dents with pattern design,” the 19-year-old said. “I have absolutely no clue.”

IT WILL GO TO THE ECUADORIAN 
CONSULATE OFFICE IN MIAMI.
By Suzette Herrera
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students are collecting clothes, 
food and hygiene items for survivors of 
Ecuador’s earthquake.
About 50 students started collecting 
Monday after an earthquake hit the coast 
of Ecuador, causing hundreds of deaths 
and leaving families without food or shel-ter, said Gerardo Nunez, a student in-volved in the collection. 
The students partnered with the Insti-
tute of Hispanic-Latino Cultures. Dona-tions can be taken to La Casita on Uni-versity Avenue or La Salita in the Reitz 
Union, the UF horticultural sciences post-
doctoral student said.
Other collection sites include McCarty 
Hall B, Matherly Hall, Grinter Hall and the Horticultural Sciences Department 
at Fifield Hall. The collection will last 
through Friday.
All donations will be delivered to the 
Ecuadorian consulate office in Miami on 
Saturday morning and airlifted to disaster 
areas in the country, Nunez said.
He said he wanted to help after hearing 
about the earthquake Saturday night.
“I was scared,” Nunez said. “My par-
ents were at a wedding maybe 30 minutes away from it at the time. They are safe, 
but not every family was as fortunate.”
Michelle Phillips, a junior economist 
at UF’s Warrington College of Business 
Administration’s Public Utility Research Center, was one of the first to donate. She 
found out about the collection through 
Facebook.
The Chilean native said she thinks stu-
dents should empty out their closets and 
donate anything they can.
“I’ve never lost anything in an earth-
quake,” the 33-year-old said. “I can’t 
imagine going through one and losing ev-erything.”

You can lead Sherman to water, but 
you can’t make him drink.
“He has a unique personality to say 
the least,” said Bebe Edwards, the horse’s 
owner.
Edwards adopted Sherman, also known 
as  “The Shermanator” and “Squirmin’ 
Sherman,” from the Horse Protection As-
sociation of Florida, which will host Hors-es Helping Horses on Saturday.
Although the fundraiser is in its sev-
enth year, this year’s event will cater to 
the general public rather than just horse 
enthusiasts, said Karen Curran, the volun-teer coordinator.
The change is an effort to compete for 
a $10,000 grant from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, she said.
“It used to be for those in the know,” 
Curran said. “Now it’s an event everybody 
can enjoy.”
Canterbury Showplace, located at 
23100 W. Newberry Road, will start host-
ing the silent auction, wine-and-cheese 
party, demonstrations and pony rides at 
8 a.m.
It will end, Curran said, when the hors-
es get tired in the early evening.The HPAF rescues abandoned, neglect-
ed, and abused horses and nurses them 
back to health at its farm in Micanopy, 
Curran said.
She said it costs about $8,000 a month 
to feed the about 70 horses that currently live on the farm.
“We survive on grant money, dona-
tions and gifts from the public,” she said. “Every cent goes right back to the horses.”
Sherman the horse will accompany his 
owner to the event, where she will talk about their adoption experience.
“It’s like meeting a guy for the ﬁ  rst 
time,” Edwards said. “I don’t even know what drew me in. He knows I’m his per-
son.”

A nonprofit thrift store will host 
two new events to promote sus-
tainability throughout the week-end.
Repurpose Project Runway 
starts at 6 p.m. Friday and will feature outfits created from trash, or “trashion,” according to a press release.
The Repurpose Project, located 
at 1920 NE 23rd Ave., will host the show on its special event space. Visitors who wear recycled mate-rials will have the opportunity to win prizes, according to the re-lease.
Continuing its message of sus-
tainability, the store will reuse its fashion show set up for The Repur-pose Project’s Spring Gleaning Fes-tival and Flea Market on Saturday from noon to 4 p.m.
“The idea is to think outside the 
box and use things that are com-monly thrown away,” said Sarah 
Goff, the project’s co-founder. “If 
you buy used, then you’re not con-tributing to the waste.”
She said the festival will include games, music, food and shopping.
“All this leftover stuff that peo-
ple don’t want, we’re collecting it 
and making it available to those 
that need it and want it,” Goff said.
Brian Reed, 23, said he recently 
helped his nephew use 2-liter bot-tles to make a water spout.
Events that promote sustain-
ability, he said, will have a lasting effect on the community.
“I am encouraging all my 
friends to go because it will be a fun time and a unique experience to get to know more about how we can save the planet,” Reed said. Trashy events ‘in’ this weekend

Robots will throw things, navigate 
mazes and dance for the last time to-day.
The robots are built in UF’s Intel-
ligent Machines Design Lab. The as-
sociate professor who teaches the 
course, Antonio Arroyo, will retire this semester, said Eric Schwartz, the associate director of the Machine In-telligence Lab.
Because of this, Schwartz said he 
doesn’t know if Robot Demo Day will be offered until December 2017. They’ll bring the event back if the pro-fessor comes back.
The demonstration will be held at 
the New Engineering Building’s Har-ris Rotunda from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and feature about 10 robots. Students spent the semester making them, which cost between $300 and $400.
Students are provided basic parts 
for robots but are responsible for pur-chasing the rest of the components themselves, he said.
Schwartz said he started the demo 
day about 15 years ago to show the Gainesville community what students create.Students can design robots to do 
whatever they want.
“There are no rules in the class,” 
he said.
Christian Cousin, a UF mechanical 
engineering doctoral student, created the cat-shaped robot CATastrophe.
The 23-year-old said he spent 15 
hours a week and $500 building it. The robot acts like a cat and uses a camera to track robotic beetles.
After tracking them, it chases the 
beetles down and catches them with a magnetic arm, he said.
“He’s a cat, and I like puns,” Cous-
in said.UF hosts last annual Robot Demo Day

RESEARCH ROUNDUP
UF study shows people focus on 
negative traits in partners 
A new study found people tend to focus on a partner’s 
negative traits rather than the positive ones when consider-
ing a relationship.
Gregory Webster, an associate professor in UF’s Depart-
ment of Psychology, said he got involved when another pro-
fessor conducting the research approached him and asked if 
he would help. The research itself took about a year to con-duct. Previous researchers focused on evaluating positive traits in partners rather than the negative traits that people tend to avoid, he said.
“We thought it would be interesting to look at (this top-
ic), and we would learn a lot more,” Webster said.
He and the other researchers sent online surveys to sev-
eral thousand single people to collect the data, he said. They 
compiled this research for their paper.
After conducting the research, they found people tend to 
weigh negative information about partners more than they 
weigh positive information, he said.
Overall, the study illustrates that people tend to think 
about relationships in terms of positive and negative traits, he said.
“People want to ﬁ  nd the optimum, or best, partner when 
they’re probably just as happy avoiding partners with traits 
that they don’t like,” Webster said.
- Brooke SteinbergUF researchers find shrimp 
preservation alternatives
UF researchers have found a way to preserve 
shrimp without sodium.
Sodium is added to shrimp to help it retain water 
and stay fresh longer, said Paul Sarnoski, the study’s 
main researcher. He wanted to know if polysaccha-rides, a type of carbohydrate used in products like gum, would work better to keep shrimp moist.
During the research, he dipped shrimp in different 
types of solutions, said Sarnoski, an assistant profes-sor of food science and human nutrition. The research-ers then used a group of judges with an acute sense of taste to evaluate how the shrimp tasted.
“We found polysaccharides showed no signiﬁ  cant 
difference in terms of taste to the participants” he said.
One polysaccharide that worked well in keeping the 
shrimp fresh was xanthan gum, an ingredient found in 
Gatorade. The team also found another carbohydrate, 
ﬁ  bercolloid, to be successful.
Sarnoski said he hopes the two polysaccharides are 
used in the future, but the food industry needs to look at alternative products before this can happen.
“The next stage is commercialization,” he said.
- Kaelah ScheffUF researches alternative 
treatment for bloat
Six researchers at UF’s Small Animal Hospital are try-
ing to increase survival rates of dogs suffering from a bloat 
disease.
Gastric dilatation-volvulus, also referred to as bloat, is 
a deadly stomach disease commonly found in large dog 
breeds. Dogs with it have a bloated stomach that twists 
over on itself, compressing vital vessels and organs. If un-treated, it kills them. 
“It’s a scary disease, and that is one of the reasons we 
wanted to look into it,” said Alex Fox-Alvarez, one of the principal investigators for the study. 
Currently, dogs are treated with a tube down their 
esophagi or by piercing their stomachs with a needle. Both techniques are internal and temporary.
UF researchers are using an external needle to deﬂ  ate 
dogs’ stomachs.
“Because it’s on the outside, we’re able to place a de-
vice that can stay there and maintain decompression, giv-ing the dog a higher chance at survival,” Fox-Alvarez said. 
The researchers hope to treat 16 dogs in the trial — half 
with the old techniques and half with the new. The new device has been successful, he said.
“Ultimately, our goal is to have another tool in our rep-
ertoire of treating the disease,” Fox-Alvarez said.

THEY WILL MOVE ON TO 
THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMPETITION IN 
NOVEMBER.
By Martin Vassolo
Alligator Staff Writer
Members of the Alachua Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce SWAT team 
traveled to Fredericktown, Mis-
souri, and placed ﬁ  rst in a four-
day competition over the week-end.
The team now qualiﬁ  es to 
enter the 34th Annual SWAT Round-Up International Compe-tition and Vendor Trade Show, which will take place in Orlando in November.
Competing in the fourth an-
nual Southeast Missouri SWAT Challenge from Thursday through Sunday. The team of seven ASO 
sergeants and deputies tested 
their weapons expertise and physical ﬁ  tness, according to a press release.
The team muscled through ﬁ  ve 
courses including a simulated ter-rorist attack, a mock rescue mis-sion and an obstacle course, ASO spokesman Art Forgey said.
Sgt. Joe Vangorder, Sgt. Josh Crews, Deputy James Ferguson, Deputy Barrett Boyette, Deputy Chris Drake, Deputy Wes Krames and Deputy Marvin Gunn com-
peted on the team, according to a 
press release.
The men beat 14 other teams 
in four of ﬁ  ve challenges and took the No. 1 overall spot. 
The teams came from Mis-
souri, Florida and Illinois, Forgey said.
Deputy Krames also beat 11 
competitors in the Super SWAT Cop competition and earned sec-ond place.
In the Top Shot competition, 
Sgt. Crews placed third place, and 
Deputy Gunn placed fourth.  
Forgey said the ASO SWAT 
team, which consists of more 
than 20 members, trains with 
SWAT teams from the Gainesville 
Police Department and the Jack-sonville Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce.
“I think it’s a good indication 
that we have a very high-trained, 
well-trained SWAT team that is 
capable of doing about anything,” he said.

UF men's basketball team adds new recruit
Deaundrae Ballard, a small forward out of Atlanta, committed to the Gators 
on Tuesday, according to HoopSeen.com's Corey Evans. Ballard is a four-star recruit and is rated as the No. 58 player in the country by 247Sports. He is the second commitment in UF's 2017 class. By Luis T orres

Buddy Reed stepped off a plane in West 
Palm Beach in the summer of 2012. 
Once he set foot on the ground, he in-
stantly fell in love.
Surrounded by sunshine, sandy beaches 
and 75-degree weather, Buddy — a high 
school junior at the time — thought he found the place where he’d be continuing his bud-ding baseball career in just two years. 
“I thought that’s where (the) University 
of Florida was,” he recalled. “So I was like, 
‘OK, this is pretty cool, we’re going to be at 
the beach.’”
But the ensuing car ride to Gainesville 
dashed his dreams of spending off days play-ing in the sand.
“We drove four hours and I was like, ‘this 
is not what I expected at first,’” Buddy said. “I didn’t expect to be here in the middle of nowhere, but I take it for what it is.”
Now in his junior year at UF, Buddy is 
aware of his surroundings. He’s aware this Florida team has a chance to win its first na-tional championship in program history and the impact that will leave on the program.
He’s aware of his draft stock — he’s pro-
jected to be a first-round pick in the 2016 MLB Draft.
But for Buddy, he was an unknown com-
modity prior to his arrival, armed with just one baseball scholarship in hand. 
He gave up his love of two other sports to 
come to Florida. Since then, he’s been one of the best center fielders in the country. 
“I know baseball is a game of repetition 
and it gets repetitive after a while, but that’s why you play the game because you love it,” 
Buddy said. “And I’m one of the best.”

Born Michael Reed, “Buddy” never 
thought of himself as a baseball player.
In fact, he never fancied the sport. 
His pedigree was in hockey — a sport his 
father played — and soccer.
He played every position imaginable in 
hockey. He used his length as a goalie, his speed along the wings, his playmaking abil-ity as a center and his overall fitness and in-stincts as a defender.
Buddy said he garnered interest from 
Providence College about playing hockey, but nothing ever came of it.
In soccer, he was a striker. His speed — 
his greatest asset — and his graceful running ability made him a goal-scoring threat. Bud-dy led St. George’s School in Rhode Island in goals during his senior year. 
And then there was baseball.  His father, who played stickball growing 
up in the Bronx, introduced him to the sport. Buddy gravitated to baseball because of him. “It wasn’t really a sport I loved at first,” 
Buddy said. “It was something I always played and had fun.”
He also picked up something from his 
other parent. His mother taught him to be-come a switch hitter at an early age.  
“You’re going to hit on this side and then 
after you get tired you’re going to hit on the 
other side,” Buddy recalled his mother tell-
ing him. “So you’re just going to go back and forth.” 
It’s an asset that’s made him an intriguing 
prospect for the MLB Draft. A switch-hitting outfielder with his intangibles doesn’t come around too often, and it gives him an advan-tage over his competitors.
“I was just swinging, I didn’t know exact-
ly what I was doing,” Buddy said. “But the fact that she made me do it from both sides was definitely something that has given me an edge over certain people.”

Four years ago, Florida assistant coach 
Brad Weitzel traveled to the UCF Showcase in Orlando to scout potential recruits. 
The Knights invite players from across 
the country to participate so that they have a 
chance to be seen by colleges. At that point, 
Buddy wasn’t on any Division I team’s radar.
However, Weitzel found him to be a po-A Proven Commodity

Buddy Reed points to the sky after hitting a home run during UF's 7-5 win over Missouri on March 20 at McKethan Stadium. 
BASEBALL
By Luis T orres
Sports Writer
Frank Rubio brings a different dimension out 
of the Gators’ bullpen.
He doesn’t have the power fastball like team-
mate Jackson Kowar. Instead, the righty relies on a sidearm pitch to stymie batters, only need-
ing to reach the high-80s to make his point. 
Rubio used his unique pitching style to baffle 
Jacksonville’s lineup on Tuesday night in relief 
of Kowar. The junior threw a season-high 3.2 innings, picking up his third win of the season as the No. 2 Gators beat the Dolphins 3-1. 
With the win, Florida is now 22-1 in noncon-
ference games and 12-0 during midweek games. 
Rubio retired the first eight batters he faced 
and allowed just two hits during his outing out of the bullpen.
“Jackson throws pretty hard, so coming in 
throwing with a little dip in velocity but in a dif-ferent look definitely I think kept their hitters off balance,” Rubio said.
Jacksonville’s Austin Hays opened the scor-
ing with a solo home run to left field off of Kowar in the first inning. It was Hays’ 13th home run of the season, and it gave the Dolphins (22-14) momentum. 
Rubio came in and stonewalled the Dol-
phins’ lineup, giving the Gators hope of a come back. 
Florida (34-5) tied the game at one in the 
bottom of the fourth when Buddy Reed scored from third on a wild pitch from Jacksonville’s Casey Kulina. Mike Rivera gave UF the lead for good when he hit an RBI groundout in the sixth that scored Reed. 
The Gators’ offense added their third run 
in the seventh when Jonathan India hit an RBI single. India’s hit was one of just seven hits on the night for Florida, something coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan attributed to the windy conditions. 
“It wasn’t a very good offensive night,” 
O’Sullivan said. 
Rubio was lifted in the top of the seventh af-
ter allowing a two-out single. Former UF pitcher 
Taylor Lewis also had the same sidearm pitch-ing motion that Rubio picked up while throwing bullpen sessions with Lewis.
“He kind of laid the groundwork for me,” 
Rubio said of Lewis. “I had a lot of confidence changing my arm slot.” 
Rubio’s outing gives O’Sullivan more weap-
ons to an already deep pitching staff. O’Sullivan said he was great during offseason workouts, but Tuesday night finally showed what he’s ca-
pable of. 
“I thought Frank was outstanding,” 
O’Sullivan said. “... I think he’s very confident. 
I was hoping and expecting for him to have a good year for us.”

tential gem. 
“He stayed around the next day, 
watched him play a doubleheader 
and basically came back saying we’ve got a switch hitting athlete 
that is really interesting,” UF coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan said.
Buddy was surprised when Flor-
ida approached him. He wasn’t one 
of the showcase’s standout players, 
he didn’t hit well and he threw just 
OK. 
But Weitzel liked Buddy’s en-
ergy. 
“From there, he stayed to watch 
me throw and hit, and he followed 
me from there,” Buddy said. 
“Now I’m here.”Assistant coach Craig Bell was 
the next to take a hard look at Bud-
dy. He came back scratching his 
head, not knowing what to make of him as a baseball prospect. 
The switch-hitting prowess he 
brought along with his athletic abil-ity intrigued O’Sullivan, who was next in line to make sense of Buddy the baseball player. “I sat on him in Atlanta for about 
a few games and it just got to a point where he had interest in us, we had interest in him,” O’Sullivan said. 
“When I ﬁ  nally met him and he 
came on campus, it was a no-brain-
er personality-wise. He has made us 
look smart. He’s a really talented kid, but he had never really focused in on baseball.”
From there, hard work took 
over.
Buddy always had the raw 
tools to be a great baseball player, but even those around him were 
amazed at how far he came after 
earning only one baseball scholar-ship. 
“You gotta create your opportu-
nities for yourself and if you get that opportunity, don’t take it for grant-ed,” Buddy said. “Deﬁ  nitely work as hard as you can to go with it and make something out of yourself.”
      
Before every home game, after 
Florida is done with its stretching and warmups, the team gathers in left ﬁ  eld. They huddle and raise their arms in the air, getting ready for another game at McKethan Sta-dium. Afterward, the team breaks and heads toward the dugout to prepare for player introductions.
Buddy is always one of the last 
players to join them in the dugout, 
and before he does, he takes off his 
hat and squats.
He bends his head in prayer and 
does the same after the National Anthem. 
“I’m pretty religious. I’m Baptist. 
I believe that God has a plan for all of us,” Buddy said. “He doesn’t choose sides but He deﬁ  nitely is al-
ways there and He’s always present 
with me.”
God’s plan for Buddy has 
worked.
He’s no longer unknown and un-
proven. 
People around the country know 
who Buddy is, and this past sum-mer, he had a chance to showcase 
his abilities when he was a part of 
the 2015 USA Baseball Collegiate National Team with A.J. Puk, Lo-gan Shore and JJ Schwarz. 
“Over the summer, he was just 
showing off his speed,” Schwarz said. “The other teams didn’t really know about Buddy Reed, so it was fun to watch him take advantage of his tools.”
When Schwarz was asked if 
teams now take notice of who Buddy is, he had a simple response: 
“Yeah, probably,” Schwarz said. 
“He’s a game changer in the 
outﬁ  eld with how much ground he 
covers and with every at-bat, he has the chance to beat the ball out. …It’s just really fun to watch.”
Junior outﬁ  elder Ryan Larson 
echoed Schwarz’s praise of Bud-dy. Larson saw Buddy grow under 
former Florida outﬁ  elder Harrison 
Bader, and watched those two chase ﬂ  y balls. 
Now that Bader is gone, Larson 
is willing to let Buddy take charge in center.  
“You can’t be bad with Buddy 
Reed in center ﬁ  eld chasing down balls,” junior outﬁ  elder Ryan Lar-
son said. 
“I kind of say, ‘Buddy, you take 
what you want. If you’re feeling 
tired I’ll grab the other stuff.'"
Florida was one game short of 
reaching the College World Series Championship Series in 2015. Bud-dy was a big part of it, and now, he’s instrumental to the Gators' suc-cess as they continue their march towards the end of the regular sea-son and the postseason.
He’s hitting .303, has 44 hits and 
he leads the team with 18 stolen bases and 36 runs scored.  
Not bad for a guy who has only 
taken the sport seriously for the last ﬁ  ve or six years. 
Buddy was given a shot to prove 
himself when he was discovered by the Florida coaching staff. 
He wants that to be an element 
of the legacy he leaves once he’s no longer chasing ﬂ  y balls at McKeth-an Stadium, instead doing the same thing at the professional level. 
“I just want to be remembered as 
a leader, one of the best to come to the University of Florida,” he said. 
“Hopefully the best center ﬁ  eld-
er, but to be the best teammate and 
the best person that’s come through 
here and show, even no matter where you start from, everybody can get a opportunity.”

I can’t believe that I’m writing this.
I can’t believe I’ve been working at this 
newspaper for two years, and I can’t believe 
that I’m graduating next Friday.
In August of 2012, I was a computer sci-
ence major, but that was really just a placeholder 
until I ﬁ  gured out what I seriously wanted to do.
Luckily, I found journalism. When I was in 
sixth grade — 11 years old — Florida football and 
basketball both won national championships.
My mom didn’t want me staying up late 
watching the games, so my dad would record the 
games for me to watch later. Later meant 5 a.m.
I would get up early, sit in the dark and watch 
the National Championship games before school. Ten years later, I found myself 
sitting courtside in the O’Connell 
Center covering Gators basketball for this newspaper. Each time I would see those National Champi-onship banners hanging above me, 
I would think of those dark, tense 
mornings sitting on my couch with 
the glow of the TV ﬂ  ooding the liv-ing room.
I’ve turned my love of sports into 
a job — a fun job, at that. I came to UF as a clue-
less kid from Melbourne and I’m leaving with a 
passion to pursue a career — a sense of purpose. The Alligator gave me that.Mom, Dad, Anna, Yaya, thank 
you for your unconditional love and support. I wouldn’t be in this posi-tion without you and everything you’ve done for me. I love you guys.
All my family, friends, teachers 
and coaches, you guys have made 
me who I am. Jackie, you keep me 
grounded, buddy. Thank you.
I need to thank Adam Lichten-
stein, who hired me in 2014. You 
gave me a chance. Jordan McPherson, Graham 
Hall and Ian Cohen, you all helped me become 
a better writer. You were the three best editors I could have asked for. Thank you.I want to thank everyone I worked with at the 
Alligator —  not just sports, but everybody. Alliga-tor alums have a history of doing great things after they graduate, and now I know why.
Finally, I want to thank anyone who has ever 
read anything I’ve written. You are who I do this 
for, and I hope you’ve enjoyed my sports coverage 
over the years. If you happen to see me around 
and recognize me by this small column headshot, please, come up and say hi. I’d love to meet you.
Until then, Maminakis out.

When I walked through the 
doors of this old building back in January 2014, I was in limbo.
I knew I wanted to get 
into sports somehow, but I didn’t know if writing for print was going to be my thing. 
I’m not a journalism major. I’m 
not the greatest at grammar or sen-tence structure. I’m a telecommuni-cations major, which honestly didn’t help me become a stronger writer.
The Alligator, though, did, and 
more than two years after walking through the doors of 1105 W. Univer-sity Ave., I know what my “thing” is. 
The Alligator helped me ﬁ  nd my 
calling and my passion: to write and tell stories. 
I was hired by Adam Lichtenstein 
and Landon Watnick to be a copy editor that spring, so I would like to 
thank you two, ﬁ  rst. I still remember 
when Adam called me that one night. Before he even ﬁ  nished offering the job to me, I said yes.
I came back in fall 2015, and the 
sports section was under new man-agement with Jordan McPherson and Eden Otero in charge. 
Both of them gave me the golf 
beat, and from there I knew this was what I wanted to do. So, I thank you both again for giving me that oppor-tunity. 
From there, I moved up the alli-
gatorSports chain, which eventually culminated with me becoming the as-sistant sports editor last summer. 
I worked under Graham Hall, who I want to thank for putting up with me, because I know I was hard to 
deal with sometimes. I covered foot-
ball with Graham, Jordan and Gra-ham Hack, and while it was always a stressful beat, it was worth it. 
So with that, I want to thank each 
of you and the others from that time.
Graham, you motivated me more 
than you ever will know. I looked up to you and learned so much from 
you, and that will stick with me for-
ever. Thank you, man.
Hack, even though no one likes 
you — just kidding — thanks for the moments during our road trips, especially the one to Alabama for Southeastern Conference Media Days in July. I’ll never be able to listen to country music without thinking of 
you.
Jordan, I wouldn’t be here with-
out you. You taught me how to write 
and helped me develop my passion. Thank you for dealing with me when-ever I asked you hundreds of ques-tions — daily — on how to approach a story. You’re going to go far in this profession. Keep up the amazing 
work, man.To my wonderful girlfriend, Ash-
ley, thanks for being my rock during 
all those stressful times, including when I couldn’t talk to Jarrad Davis for my feature on him. You inspired 
me and motivated me more than 
you’ll ever know. Thank you. 
And to the rest of the people I be-
came close to during the football road trips — Emily, Ariana, Alyssa and others — you all are some of the best journalists I know, and you’re even better friends.
To Ian and Ethan, the sports sec-
tion is in great shape with you two, and it’s been a pleasure watching you grow. There’s no doubt in my mind you two will keep on getting better and better each day. 
So with that, I leave you with this: 
When we announced that we were moving to a new place, someone came up to me and asked if the Al-
ligator was shutting down.
The Alligator isn’t shutting down. 
Bigger and better things are in store. 
It’s been an honor working here and being a part of the last graduating class at 1105 W. University Ave.
There will be many others who 
were like me when I ﬁ  rst entered these doors, not knowing what they 
want to do. But just like me, they’ll 
ﬁ  nd their passion. 
And the Alligator will forever be 
my home in Gainesville.

Alligator helps editor ﬁ  nd passion, career path
I get overly sentimental about sports.
Whether I’m 
watching one of my favorite athletes in his 
or her ﬁ  nal season or wit-nessing a historic achieve-ment, I always try to real-ize the magnitude of the moment and appreciate it to the fullest.
But I’ve never shared that same 
attitude about my own life.
Maybe it’s because I don’t like 
change, or because change is easier to accept if you don’t make it a big deal.
Or maybe, deep down, there’s too 
much at stake in the real world, and rather than get overwhelmed by that fact, I prefer to spend my emotions in the sports world where the conse-quences aren’t really that important.
Regardless, I’ve had far too many 
people over the last few months ask me questions like “Are you going to miss college?” or “How does it feel to be moving on to the next stage in your life?”
Honestly, I’d rather not think 
about it, thank you.
But it’s difﬁ  cult to write a goodbye 
column without being sentimental, 
and the ingredients are so readily 
available.
There’s my ﬁ  rst interview when 
I applied to the Alligator, scared to death that my resume wouldn’t pass muster with the sledgehammer edit-ing duo of Jordan McPherson and Eden Otero.
There’s my ﬁ  rst time covering a soccer game when I mis-took UF goalkeeper Tay-lor Burke for a striker and asked her to describe the goal she hadn’t scored.
There’s the time I con-
ducted a 30-minute inter-view with gymnast Kytra Hunter only to have my recorder conk out and de-lete the whole thing.
There’s also the time I went to 
Southeastern Conference Media Days with Luis Torres and asked Steve 
Spurrier about his golf game.
And how could I forget peeing in 
the urinal at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium 
next to Verne Lundquist when Florida hosted Tennessee, or getting to wit-ness Death Valley and driving back from Baton Rouge in Graham Hall’s Prius in under eight hours so I could catch the end of a NASCAR race.
I look back on those memories 
and many more with fondness. They’re times I’ll never forget.
But I hate thinking about them like 
that, because it means they’re over. 
And really, they aren’t over be-
cause the friendships I’ve made will continue long after we stop working at the Alligator.
That’s how I prefer to look at
