Accent Speaker’s Bureau and Jewish Awareness Month 
are sponsoring an appearance by Saturday Night Live co-
median Seth Meyers at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center on 
Thursday at 8 p.m.
Meyers will receive $50,000 to perform stand-up com-
edy and answer questions from audience members.
Accent chairman Corey Portnoy said they decided on 
Meyers because he began his career in college and might be 
able to reach out to aspiring entertainers at UF.
“We also chose him because he is a head writer for ‘Sat-
urday Night Live,’ which is a show that has had tremen-dous success for many years,” he said.
Tickets are not required for the free event. The doors 
will open at 7 p.m., and seating is ﬁ  rst come, ﬁ  rst served.

Rachael Cain, 18, has been a fan of “SNL” since she snuck into her parents’ 
bedroom when she was 6 and caught a 
glimpse of Will Ferrell playing his cow-
bell.
She is also a fan of Meyers.
“He is so brilliant and witty, and I am 
just so excited,” she said. “I look up to Seth Meyers, and I want to know how he became so successful.”
The comedian and actor is best known for his role as 
head writer and “Weekend Update” anchor on “SNL.” He has also appeared in movies, hosted the 2010 and 2011 ESPY Awards on ESPN and served as a guest speaker at 
the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner.Actor, comedian

Kappa Alpha Psi recruits were slapped in the chest 
and back, forced to exercise and spanked with canes by 
some of the fraternity members during a nine-month stretch in 2010-11.
According to a sworn complaint written by the Uni-
versity Police Department and released by the State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce Monday morning, 13 members of the fraternity received charges of hazing with the risk of physical injury or death — a third-degree felony in Florida. The complaint names ﬁ  ve victims, all of whom were KAP recruits at the time.
Of the 13 members charged, four were still students

� THE CITY OF GAINESVILLE SUPPORTS REPEALING 
OF LAW.
ADRIANNA PAIDAS
Alligator Writer
The City of Gainesville has joined Los Angeles and oth-
er U.S. cities to take a stand against an Arizona immigra-
tion law. The law gives police ofﬁ  cers the right to stop or 
arrest anyone in the state who they think may be an illegal 
immigrant.During a City Commission meeting Thursday, the com-
mission voted unanimously, with Com-missioner Todd Chase absent, to join a le-
gal brief against the state of Arizona and its law targeting immigration.
The case, titled U.S. v. the State of 
Arizona, will be heard in front of the Su-preme Court starting April 25, according to Reuters.
The city’s name will be on a document 
submitted to the case in support of repealing the law, but the city will not be responsible for any ﬁ  nancial or time commitments.
“This is a law that is not humanitarian,” Mayor Craig 
Lowe said in an interview. “And it is one that will lead to racial proﬁ  ling.”
The issue at hand is whether Arizona lawmakers have 
the right to pass a law that would require ofﬁ  cers to stop or arrest people based on perceived immigration status.
The federal government, not individual states, has the 
right to pass immigration laws, said Berta Hernandez-City ofﬁ  cials take stand against Arizona illegal immigration lawMeyers

Students can discuss recent 
changes made by the Florida 
Legislature with a political jour -
nalist today at the Bob Graham 
Center in Pugh Hall.
Steve Bousquet, who cov-
ers state government for the 
Tampa Bay Times, will share 
his thoughts on a bill that could allow UF to increase tuition by more than 15 percent, an ap-
proximate $300 million cut in 
the State University System and 
the creation of a 12th state uni-
versity.
“Primarily, we want to know what impact these changes will 
have on Florida citizens,” said 
Gail Sasnett-Stauffer, assistant 
director for public programs at 
the Bob Graham Center.
After the presentation, audi-
ence members will be able to ask Bousquet questions about 
the legislative session and its 
effects.
“Journalists like Steve Bous-
quet increasingly serve as the 
institutional memory of the 
Florida Legislature and, more broadly, politics in the state of Florida,” said UF political sci-
ence professor Daniel A. Smith.
The discussion, which is free 
and open to the public, will be-
gin at 6 p.m. There will be 250 to 275 seats available in the Bob

When UF sophomore Opeola Bukola sits down to 
do her assigned reading, she doesn’t drop a stack of 
textbooks on her desk — she just taps on her tablet.
The telecommunication and agricultural commu-
nications and leadership development 20-year-old has 
three textbooks and 14 leisure books on her Kindle 
Fire.
Bukola loves to e-read, and she’s not alone.Tablet ownership has more than tripled among col-
lege students in the past year, according to the Pearson Foundation’s second annual Survey on Students and Tablets.
More students are reading digital books, according 
to the survey. It showed that 63 percent of college stu-
dents believe tablets will replace textbooks within the 
next five years.
At UF, student interest in digital books is growing 
each semester. But changes aren’t happening over -
night, according to information provided by Haleigh Morgan, a spokeswoman for Follett Higher Education Group. Follett operates the UF Bookstore.
Of the students who have used digital textbooks, 
two-thirds prefer them to print, Morgan wrote in an 
email.
The number of professors who submitted book or -
ders for digital textbooks has increased. Follett expects this trend to continue, she said.
About two years ago, a team of UF Health Science 
Center Library researchers investigated how they 
could provide student services on e-readers. They compared the Amazon Kindle, the Barnes & Noble Nook and the Sony Digital Reader.
The team found problems across different plat-
forms, said Clifford Richmond, the library’s director of information technology.
Now, there are many more devices, but the need 
for some standardization in published electronic re-
sources still stands, Richmond said.
He said the lack of available digital textbooks is 
what’s keeping the market from growing even more.
“The driving force is going to be that the publishers 
come up with a pricing scheme that does not make it 
any less attractive monetarily,” he said.
For Bukola, digital book prices were not cheaper in 
all cases, but the convenience was worth it.
The instant accessibility actually makes her read 
school books more often, she said.
“When I can’t be on the Internet on my Kindle, I 
need something else to do,” Bukola said. “My text-books are always right there.”

UF sophomore� MONTHLY MORTGAGE 
PAYMENTS ARE ABOUT THE SAME AS MONTHLY RENT PAYMENTS, REALTORS SAY.
ADRIANNA PAIDAS
Alligator Writer
As the housing market improves, 
some city realtors say it is now more 
realistic — and cheaper — for stu-dents to buy houses or condomini-ums in Gainesville instead of renting 
one. Not many students are buying 
into the bid, saying the short-term savings aren’t worth the long-term responsibility and cost.
Because interest rates are at an 
all-time low, a homeowner’s month-ly mortgage payments on a house or condominium are roughly the same as monthly rent payments, said 
Richard Schackow, real estate bro-
ker and president of Schackow Real Estate and Development LLC.
Market conditions are currently 
favorable because of record-low mortgage interest rates and rising rent prices, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist and senior vice president of research at the National Associa-
tion of Realtors, in a news release.
“Now is clearly the time to buy 
instead of rent, especially if stu-
dents know they are going to be in Gainesville for another four or five years,” said Tracy Storms, a realtor at Alligator Realty Inc.
For some students, the cheap 
monthly payments that come with 
buying a home are pointless because 
they still have to put down a large initial payment upon purchase.
Down payments range from 
about $6,000 to about $20,000 or more, depending on the size of the house and the loan received, Schack-ow said.Mike Leonard said the down 
payment would deter him from 
even considering buying a house or 
condominium.
“Yes, monthly payments are 
comparable, but you have to put way more money down when you buy a house,” the 20-year-old biol-ogy junior said. “I’m not going to spend that kind of money on some-thing I’m going to use 5 percent of 
my life.”
Laura McLeran said she doesn’t 
want the responsibility of taking 
care of her own house, nor does she want to go through the hassle of selling it when the time comes, espe-cially given the fluctuating housing 
market.
“I like having a landlord to take 
care of all that,” the 21-year-old mar -
keting senior said.
Since November, Storms and 
Ben Goldberg, another realtor at Al-
ligator Realty Inc., have sold 13 con-dominiums to students — the most they have ever sold in a four-month 
period since 2008.
Five years ago, Schackow de-
veloped Forest Creek, a 28-lot sub-
division located on Northwest 34th Avenue. Out of that count, eight of the homes have been sold and built. Four more have been sold over the 
last few months but are in the midst 
of construction. Homes in the subdi-vision currently range from $139,900 to $300,000.
Potential buyers who have their 
eye on a $139,900 house in the subdi-vision will currently pay $956.61 per month for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom space.
The monthly mortgage payment 
factors in a common 30-year loan that covers 95 percent of the prop-erty value.
Those who rent apartments in The Enclave Apartments, a complex about 3 miles from UF, pay $1,575 
rent per month to rent a three-bed-
room and three-bathroom space, according to Isabella Jebian, leasing specialist at The Enclave.
The price includes utilities, cable 
and fees. Rent is usually split among those living in the space, so the monthly payment is divided among roommates.
Owning a place is feasible for 
students who are planning to stay in Gainesville for graduate school or to work because they stand to make money off the house if its value in-creases, Schackow said.
Students should not dwell on the 
down payment because, he said, the investments to be made on owning 
a home outweigh the initial pay-
ments.
“The difference is that you sink 
all this money into paying rent, and at the end of your three or four years, you have nothing to show for it,” Schackow said.
Although she understood that 
mentality , Carley Fuller said there 
is no point in buying a house when 
she isn’t going to stay in Gainesville for long.
“I can’t justify buying a house 
when I’m only going to school here,” the 20-year-old sophomore said. “I would only consider it if I got a job here after college.”
Camilla Savanti thought differ -
ently.
The 24-year-old UF dental stu-
dent has been living in a condomin-ium she owns for the past year. She said her family wanted to take ad-vantage of the low housing prices.
“It’s just cheaper to own,” Savan-
ti said. “And at the end of the day , you will have something to re-sell.”

A Gainesville man was ar -
rested Sunday night and accused 
of hitting a police dog after it tracked him down during a foot chase.
James Cantrall Grant, 33, was 
charged with striking a police dog, resisting an officer without violence and being a habitual traffic offender, according to a Gainesville Police arrest report.
Around 10 p.m. Sunday, Of-
ficer Robert White pulled over Grant for a traffic infraction. 
Grant immediately got out of the 
car and started walking away . White ordered Grant to stop, but Grant ignored him and ran into a heavily wooded area near South-east 10th Avenue.
A K-9 unit arrived on the 
scene after GPD learned Grant was a habitual traffic offender 
and had an active warrant. His 
license was revoked in 1996. The warrant was for violating his pa-role in failing to register as a sex offender, according to the report.
After tracking Grant for about 
a quarter of a mile through thick palmetto bushes, Justice, the dog, found Grant hiding in a large bush. While trying to break free, Grant pulled on Justice’s 
head and then 
punched Jus-
tice multiple times, accord-ing to police.
After the 
scuffle, Justice had a cut snout and Grant had a leg wound.  
Grant’s mother, who an-
swered a phone number pro-vided by Grant, said she didn’t know what happened. She said she went to Shands at UF on Sunday to see her son but he was under police custody.
Grant was still in jail without 
bond as of press time.

The physical and emotional scars of former smok-
ers are being revealed in a bold new ad campaign 
created by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention.
The “Tips from Former Smokers” ads will appear 
on billboards, TV , radio, online, in print and in the-
aters across the U.S. for at least 12 weeks in an effort 
to discourage smoking, according to a CDC news re-
lease. The campaign kicked off Monday.
Some experts question how effective the campaign 
will be, especially for the college-age audience.
“I was actually kind of surprised that the CDC 
is using such a graphic campaign,” UF GatorWell Health Promotion Services Director Shirley Haber -
man said. “Research has really dissuaded against us-
ing fear-based tactics.”
The ads use graphic images to share the personal 
stories of smokers who have suffered from various 
smoking-related diseases.
One ad shows a 31-year-old amputee who lost his 
legs to Buerger’s disease, a result of smoking.
Another ad uses a photo of a former smoker shav-
ing. Referring to the quarter-sized hole in his neck, it says, “Be careful not to cut your stoma.”
Haberman said UF has a relatively low number of smokers and that the school’s smoking cessation programs help students quit.
However, students don’t necessarily think that 
the ad campaign is the best method of convincing smokers to quit.
Elizabeth Lopez, a 19-year-old marketing and 
psychology sophomore, said the ads offer a good message, but she said she doubts its long-term suc-
cess.
“People are going to do what they want to do at 
the end of the day,” she said. “They know the reper -
cussions.”
The campaign will cost the government $54 mil-
lion, according to the Associated Press.
Andrew Romero, a tobacco prevention specialist 
at the Alachua County Health Department, said To-bacco-Free Florida has produced similar campaigns. 
He said that in the past, the ads seemed to have had an impact on younger audiences.
“There’s quite a bit of evidence that campaigns 
similar to this have worked before,” he said.Effects of graphic anti-smoking 
campaign still remain to be seen

UF sophomore� THE FACILITY COST 
$250,000. 
MICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON

About 80 students, pro-
fessors and alumni attended 
the grand opening of a new digital media lab in Weimer Hall on Monday night.
AHA! The Innovation 
CoLab is a complement to the building’s basement 21st Century News Laboratory, which opened in 2010. Both are part of the Center for Me-dia Innovation and Research in the College of Journalism and Communications.
“The central theme be-
hind both of them is collabo-ration, teamwork, working together,” said professor Da-vid Carlson, executive direc-tor for the center.
The new facility cost 
about $250,000, which was funded by a start-up pack-age of university funds from President Bernie Machen, Carlson said.
The 2,500-square-foot fa-
cility, located in the Flanagan Wing of Weimer Hall, fea-tures a central working area and four breakout suites. The suites, which can seat 28 students collectively, are equipped with whiteboards, a high-tech conference table and two LCD screens each.
Carlson said the new lab 
was created for all students but is geared toward adver -
tising and public relations majors.Participants in Saturday’s 
Ad Dash event presented advertisement group proj-ects they had created in the new lab.  
Jason Meneely, an assis -
tant professor of interior de-sign and the hired consultant for the lab’s design, called the lab a “creative-era” class -room intended to encourage 
student collaboration.
Professors can schedule 
classes in the facility, but it 
was intentionally placed in a 
high-traffic area of the build-
ing.
“It was about creating a 
space for collision of people 
and ideas,” Meneely said.

but would like to express their sup-

“This clearly signals that Gainesville 
believes we should treat people fairly 
and not single out a certain popula-tion,” Hernandez-Truyol said.
Lowe said he also doesn’t like the 
fact that the law makes city police of-ficers enforce federal civil law instead of criminal law.
“It puts the police in conflict with 
local immigrant communities, which undermines their relationship,” Lowe said.
UF law student William Hummel, 
24, said he not only supports the hu-man rights standpoint taken by the city, but he also agrees that cities should speak up for themselves.
“If states are going to force local 
mandates on cities, then cities should express how they feel about this,” Hummel said.

A recent study shows the current generation’s 
college students are less interested in recycling and 
the environment than past students.
According to a study published March 5 in the 
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , fewer 
students are taking action to help the environment. 
Millennials, the generation born after 1982, showed less interest in their communities, social issues and protecting the environment than Generation X.
Researchers pulled information from two data 
collections to evaluate high school seniors and col-lege freshmen.
Fifteen percent of Millennials said they made no 
personal effort to help the environment. Five percent 
of baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1961, said 
the same.
Ashley Pennington, outreach coordinator for the 
Office of Sustainability, said the study does not cor -
relate with what she sees at UF.
According to the Office of Sustainability’s web-
site, UF recycles about 6,000 tons of material a year, and an office report stated that about 3,000 students are involved with sustainability.
Industrial engineering freshman Germain Guti-
errez, 19, said laziness stops him from recycling.
“I think about it, but I don’t recycle,” he said.Study: Students

Bus ridership in Gainesville continues to increase this year, 
but not due to rising gas prices.
Regional Transit System saw an increase in ridership this 
year after partnering with Santa Fe College.
Since the beginning of the Fall 2011 semester, Santa Fe stu-
dents haven’t had to pay for every ride on a city bus due to a 
$3 increase per credit hour in student fees.
Chip Skinner, the marketing and communications super -
visor for RTS, said he is surprised by the increase.“We have seen a 4 percent increase in growth for Fall 2011 
and a 3 percent increase for 2012, which is significant for only 
two months,” he said.
Skinner said 80,000 more passengers rode the bus in Feb-
ruary 2012 compared to February 2011.
RTS worked with Santa Fe College to add three new bus 
routes. Three older routes continue to operate near the col-
lege, and all the buses stop more frequently at each location.
Skinner said it took 10 years for the partnership to become 
a reality.
Students consistently asked for increased bus service, but 
the process took longer than expected.Jackson Sasser, the president of Santa Fe College, said the 
new routes are an “absolute bonus.”
More routes and increased bus ridership opens up park-
ing spots on campus. In addition, the partnership promotes safety and benefits the environment, he said.
“I hope to never build another parking lot,” Sasser said. 
“The parking index is so expensive, and it costs $10,000 per parking spot. We could build more facilities and hire more faculty.”
Cathy Vasquez, a Santa Fe sophomore, said she was glad 
the new routes were added.
“I don’t have a car, so I rely heavily on the bus system,” she 
said. “With the old routes, I had to take two different buses to get to and from school. Now, the new routes take me straight 
to and from campus.”Santa Fe students benefiting from increased bus service

an administrative assistant in the cardiology 
department.
The 13 members charged with hazing are 
banned from stepping foot on campus, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said. UPD offi-
cers started investigating the fraternity on 
Feb. 13, and the KAP national organization ordered the UF chapter to disband soon af-ter.
Police learned about hazing among KAP 
members while looking into a similar case concerning the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber said. KAP and APA are members of UF’s Nation-al Pan-Hellenic Council, which consists of 
nine historically African-American fraterni-
ties and sororities.
In February, UPD charged nine APA 
members and one alumnus with hazing.
A former KAP recruit told police the haz-
ing began on April 23, 2010, during a meet-ing at a Cottage Grove apartment. After three recruits recited information they were ordered to learn, members spanked them with canes, the recruit said.
After that meeting, members were 
spanked on about five or six more occasions, one recruit told police. Each time, recruits received between 30 and 150 spanks with canes. Sometimes, KAP members broke their tools over their victims’ bottoms, and one recruit remembers the beatings left marks on his backside from the hooks of the canes.
Recruits also had to buy food, alcohol 
and other items for members. According 
to an expense report obtained by police, re-
cruits spent about $2,000 during a six-month stretch.
KAP members also slapped them on their 
chests and backs, and they forced recruits to do push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks and wall sits.
Multiple sources told police that all 13 
men charged either beat recruits or watched 
as the hazing occurred.

Student Senator 
should not be promoted
Much to our surprise, Student Sen. Katie Waldman 
has been recommended as chair of the Allocations Committee in UF Student Government.
Last week, Jason Tiemeier issued a written apology for 
throwing away issues of the Alligator during this semes-
ter’s SG elections. 
In his apology, Tiemeier identified Waldman as the 
woman he was with during the incident. Whether or not 
Waldman actually threw away the papers is unclear; her presence during the incident is not.
As the current vice chairwoman of the Rules and Ethics 
Committee in the Student Senate, one would have hoped that Waldman might have advised Tiemeier that his ac-tions were unethical.
One also might have thought that someone on the Sen-
ate ethics committee would report unethical campaign ac-tivities during the election.
This, of course, did not happen.But what can we expect from the same Student Govern-
ment that, even after voting that eight out of 13 election codes were violated during the fall elections, did not hold anyone accountable for the screw-up?
With the recommendation that Waldman head a com-
mittee, bad behavior is being rewarded, and the corruption continues to seep deeper into the fabric of SG.
The Student Senate must not let this pass in today’s 
meeting. 
Because of her actions, Waldman should not be given a 
higher position.
Let us be clear that this is not personal.Anyone who has shown the lack of professionalism 
and responsibility that Waldman displayed during the last 
election should not be rewarded with more power.    
This appointment could very well lead to higher posi-
tions within SG, and we cannot, in good conscience, sit back 
and let this occur without expressing our displeasure.
If SG wishes to be viewed as a credible organization, it 
should address this matter by doing the following:
(1) The Student Senate should reject the recommenda-
tion that Waldman serve as chairwoman of the Allocations Committee.
(2) Waldman should step down or be removed from SG 
after not reporting the incident.
(3) Anyone else in SG who knew about the incident 
should explain why he or she did not come forward with the information.
Remember: Members of SG were claiming that the story 
had been fabricated.
Until these events occur, the scrutiny with which we 
watch SG over the coming months will only grow.
We are not asking for much. 
We simply want to see some level of accountability.
Giving Waldman a promotion within SG would defi-
nitely not be the right course of action.Kony 2012 movement garners empty support
I often hear conversations between two people seem-
ingly so consumed by their own lives that they fail to 
be concerned with anything beyond themselves. And, 
all too often, I’m one of them.
Few things are more pathetic than hearing a guy bitch 
about his girlfriend’s clinginess. Love — even in excess — is hardly a matter of grievance.
Worse yet is hearing a woman complain about her un-
fulfilled expectations, while failing to consider that she, in 
fact, could simply be too expectant.
Above all, I don’t recall ever reading (and certainly not 
writing) anything as self-conflicting as complaining about 
complaints, as I have just done. Forgive me for the time 
being.
All of our disappointments derive from the perspec-
tives we take when judging our lives.
And, despite our aptitude for socializing and multi-
tasking, some less becoming qualities plague the “Millen-nial” generation.
We believe we’re entitled outright to success and hap-
piness. We expect life to be consistently pleasant. We think 
the difficulties in our lives happen to us, not through us, 
and we often fail to recognize how fortunate we are com-pared to others and their trials.
The recent hashtagging of #Kony2012 has left me par -
ticularly bitter in this regard.
The solidarity and support that this campaign gained 
against the Ugandan warlord is surely inspiring. I awoke 
on March 7 with a newfound appreciation for the effort 
and empathy that manifests through new media.
Everyone and their pen pals were tweeting and sharing 
the video, and there was no shortage of teens changing 
their Facebook profile pictures to the campaign’s default 
poster in an attempt to make Joseph Kony “famous” (an 
elementary case of wordplay that belittles the end of the 
whole campaign). Shouldn’t the goal be to make him in-famous?
Regardless, to what effect?How many of us actually went beyond the hashtag?I didn’t. I watched the video, 
thought, “F--k that guy,” and 
forwarded it to some friends. My 
bank account went undebited, 
and, despite some conversation 
about the complexities of the is-
sue, I effectively did nothing to stop Kony and his caterpillar 
mustache.
I don’t say this to boast (al-
though, in this particular case, I’m glad I didn’t open my wallet for a trendy wristband and questionably concise ac-
tion kit). Rather, I see my inaction as a flag signaling the 
disturbing indifference of the day.
Ugandan citizens have since been shown the 30-minute 
video that went viral two weeks ago and have responded by hurling rocks and through shouts of disgust and physi-
cal anger, rivaled only by director Jason Russell’s recent 
public display of sexual catharsis.
Why is it that a short, sensational video is able to garner 
so much empty support for a day or two, while the next 
week those same supporters can hardly be brought to op-
pose or even acknowledge the rest of the world’s crises?
My worry is in regard to our apathy and paralysis un-
til we’re confronted with an issue close to home (a cute kid pointing at the “bad man,” a sensationalized Bansky-
esque night of postering and a condescendingly simple 
plan of action).
With the capability to rouse regime-toppling demon-
strations, we’ve acted only by changing our profile pic-
tures for a campaign we know nearly nothing about. Our 
emotions are so entwined with a post-colonial mentality 
that we think the mere recognition of an issue is an effec-
tive elixir, and we feel fulfilled by a single hashtag.
Yet somehow I feel my inactive criticisms are justified, 
despite my awareness that children are being sold as sex-slaves and soldiers from Houston to Kandahar.

As a college freshman and the oldest sibling in my 
family, everything in college life is new to me like a toddler who just arrived at Disney World for the 
ﬁ  rst time. I see everything, the good and the bad, through rose-colored glasses.
Or — as they say here in “Gainesvegas” — beer goggles.So as I’m still settling into this utopia of higher education, 
I’ve picked up on a few things, such as surviving Student Government elections, mastering the RTS bus routes and hating on FSU.
This weekend I learned about the reincarnation of B-list 
holidays.
Take St. Patrick’s Day, for example. Back in kindergarten, 
St. Paddy’s Day was a day of chocolate gold coins found in black pots, leprechauns and lucky four-leaf clovers.
Then around middle school, we played the cool factor 
and ditched all traditions of wearing green. March 17 was just another humdrum day in our pubescent lives.
From what I witnessed this past Saturday, people with-
out a twig of Irish in the family tree pounded green-dyed beer as if it were water. I could have mistaken Mother’s Pub for an actual pub in Dublin — the Irish pride was evident.
St. Patrick’s Day, along with Valentine’s Day, Hallow-
een, Mardi Gras, Cinco de Mayo, Oktoberfest and the Su-per Bowl (which might as well be a holiday, as it is the most-watched program on television in the U.S.) are making their comeback on col-lege campuses.
I’m no expert, but I’ve noticed 
a trend in all these celebrations. There is a uniform recipe to a suc-cessful holiday: Blend tacky party decorations and cheap dress-up 
clothes. Add alcohol. Mix in regretful mobile uploads. En-joy.
College has shown me that you don’t need to wait for 
a nationally recognized holiday to roll around to party. If you’re stuck in a boring month like September, anything can serve as an excuse for a party. Anything.
Last month, I was invited to a friend of a friend’s dog’s 
birthday party. From what I remember, I don’t recall seeing a canine panting around the shabby Midtown apartment or anything celebrating the dog in his honor. I just remember a lot of red Solo cups and contraband.
These four years have been handed to us to, yes, get an 
education, but also to live it up before we get boring again.
In a matter of a few years, we’re ushered out holding a piece of paper with President Bernie Machen’s signature 
and told to ﬁ  nd a real job with a salary, ﬁ  le federal taxes and 
get our lives together.
Soon, after-parties and beer pong tournaments will be 
reduced to something to reminisce about with somewhat-
successful college buddies. Dirty diapers and parent-teacher 
conferences will become an underwhelming reality. The 
next thing to look forward to will be retirement. A very, very 
far away retirement.
I like to see college as the halfway house into that daunt-
ing real world. It serves a buffer between the two purgato-ries we call childhood and adulthood. It has all the freedom 
of being an adult with all the responsibility of being a teen-
ager.
So for now, let’s take on commercialized holidays and 
use them for what they’re worth: a time to get together with 
friends, make some memories and then forget them.
It doesn’t hurt to be Irish, Mexican or German for a day or 
to exploit traditions for a good time.
In the span of a lifetime, four years is just an insigniﬁ  -
cant fraction. But they might just be the most signiﬁ  cant four years of your life.

Recently for President Barack Obama, 
campaign politics have unfortunately seemed to take priority over job cre-
ation. 
The president announced several weeks 
ago that he would not allow the construction 
of the Keystone Pipeline Project, a transnation-
al oil pipeline that would have created more 
than 20,000 jobs and reduced our reliance on 
oil from politically unstable nations. Even af-
ter several local and state ofﬁ  cials approved 
the project and lobbied hard on its behalf, 
the president refused because he didn’t want 
to anger the special interest environmental 
groups that support him.
The Keystone XL Pipeline is a venture by 
the energy company TransCanada to create 
a 1,700-mile pipeline connecting an oil-rich region of Alberta, Canada to U.S. reﬁ  neries in Texas. This project is a hands-down win-win, both creating badly needed construction jobs throughout the Great Plains and providing the United States with a greater amount of oil 
from our northern neighbor. In terms of job 
creation, this project is the deﬁ  nition of “shov-el-ready,” with 20,000 jobs created almost im-mediately were the president to sign the ap-proval papers.
Upon completion of the project, analysts 
have speculated that 700,000 new barrels of oil per day would ﬂ  ow into the United States from Canada instead of being shipped by tanker from the Middle East or Venezuela. 
In the long term, BusinessWeek estimated 
that the pipeline would have created an ad-ditional 500,000 U.S. jobs by 2035. However, because the president has denied construction 
permits, those jobs will now likely end up in 
Asia, as Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is now looking to China as a customer for this energy.
Obama initially delayed making a deci-
sion on the Keystone Project until 2013, asking for another environmental review that would conveniently conclude right after the 2012 presidential election. The Obama administra-
tion has a history of delaying important policy 
until 2013. Both the execution of Obamacare and the raising of the debt ceiling are other im-portant issues that the president had attempt-ed to punt past November in order to escape the political consequences of poor policy. This time, the president decided to play campaign politics again, costing America 20,000 jobs, by claiming the environmental consequences 
were too great.
Obama’s refusal to allow construction is 
confusing and unexpected, mainly because a 
three-year environmental review has already taken place, and the project was given the go-ahead. The only thing that was delaying con-struction is the fact that because the pipeline is transnational, the State Department has to approve it, giving Obama the ability to sign 
the approval. The concern that the president originally voiced after 
the ﬁ  rst environmen-tal review was the im-pact on an aquifer in Nebraska, which the 
pipeline was planned to run through. Soon after the initial delay, TransCanada offered to move the pipeline around the aquifer, incur-ring signiﬁ  cant additional costs, but the presi-dent still refused to act.
The Keystone Pipeline pits two important 
sectors of Obama’s base, labor unions and en-vironmental groups, against each other, lead-ing to a delicate political situation. Instead of 
making the tough decisions, working through 
the issue and taking a small political hit for the guaranteed creation of 20,000 jobs, the presi-dent tried to stall the decision for more than a year, beyond the presidential election. His lack of action is keeping thousands of union workers waiting at the shovel. It’s ironic that Obama has shot down this issue when he claims that job creation is the centerpiece of his 
campaign.
In contrast to the president’s pro-job rheto-
ric, however, he has repeatedly used over-
blown environmental concerns to stall energy endeavors all over the country . The American people don’t want to wait until it is politically convenient for the president to make these simple choices. The American people want jobs now, but the president decided interest 
groups and lobbyists are more important than American workers, at least until 2013. 
In a time when our nation is struggling to 
ﬁ  nd energy security, with hostile countries 
in the Middle East and Latin America threat-ening to obstruct our oil supply, why won’t 
the president look to our friendly northern 
neighbor for a safe, reliable source of energy instead?
After the initial delay of the project, con-
gressional Republicans included a provision into the payroll tax extension passed last year that forced the president to either approve or deny the project in two months’ time. House Republicans, and Speaker of the House John 
Boehner in particular, took a major political 
defeat on the payroll tax extension to force the president’s action on the Keystone Pipeline, taking the leadership necessary to create jobs.
Congressional Republicans have done ev-
erything in their power to create a business-friendly environment in the energy sector and gave the president another opportunity to ap-prove the Keystone Pipeline in a timely man-
ner. Unfortunately , the president couldn’t put 
economic growth and the interests of many job-seeking Americans over his own political agenda. Obama has consistently stressed that jobs are priority No. 1, but when an easy op-portunity to create jobs fell into his lap, he put special interests ahead of the American work-er yet again.

Anne Haisley stripped out a screw as she 
took apart one bookcase. She had 139 to go.
Between dusty cobwebs and plastic 
green chairs, Phillip Haisley sat at a front 
counter littered with books.
Anne Haisley , 72, and Phillip Haisley , 
77, co-owners of Books Inc., hope to clear 
the store of its 50,000 books before they shut 
their 20-year-old business down for good.
The couple announced this store’s clos-
ing in the fall, but the ending has dragged out longer than they initially thought.
It’s not the bad economy or digital read-
ers that killed their bookstore and cafe. The Haisleys said they are simply tired. The couple hasn’t been on a vacation in four 
years.
To help the process of closing up shop, 
they started to sell used books at 20 percent 
off, and, as of a month ago, the books are on sale for 30 percent off. So far, 70,000 books have been sold, Anne Haisley said.
Since the business opened in 1993, the 
couple hosted international Scrabble tour -
naments, sold a first-edition printing of “Huckleberry Finn” and was one of the first 13 bookstores to sell books on the Internet, 
she said.
“We have had a great time doing this,” 
he said.
Phillip Haisley said he is ready to trav-
el again. He has been to 107 countries in 
his life. Anne Haisley said she is ready to camp.
Some bookcases are still full of books. 
Others are empty.
Soon, even the shelves will be gone, too. 
The bookcases are selling for $200 each.
Through the years, they said the experi-
ence has brought them good memories and 
made their marriage stronger.
“I have white hair, in case you didn’t no-
tice,” Haisley joked to her husband.
He rifled back with, “I’ll still pretend in 
my mind you are blonde, honey.”

The Hippodrome State Theatre is 
pulling the curtain aside to show how 
it produces a play.
The Hippodrome is taking people 
behind the scenes to see the process 
of creating, developing and rehears-
ing a play in a five-week observation program.
The second weekend in the series 
is from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Friday at the Hippodrome, and tickets cost $75.
Participants will see behind the 
scenes of William Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
People will see how costumes are 
made, how the actors practice and how the set is made.
Tammy Dygert has many roles in 
the preparation of a production. She solicits scripts from writers, creates new ways of helping people connect with the play and helps the play come to life.
She said this time the program is 
focusing on the process of script-mak-ing and working on lines.
The observership offers people a 
fly-on-the-wall experience, she said.
“Why keep all these good things to ourselves?” Dygert said.
During the first session on Friday , 
participants toured the Hippodrome.
Sam Ulbing, who has been an ush-
er for shows in the past, said he was excited to finally see how plays come together.
“It doesn’t just happen,” he said. 
“And it will be a fascinating thing to see how they do it.”
Ulbing said he was excited to see 
the whole building, even the base-ment, which holds all of the parts for the 101-year-old manual elevator.
He said if the elevator operator runs 
the elevator too low, a safety measure kicks in and shuts off power to it. He 
said it is not unheard of for the Hippo-
drome staff to have to manually crank the elevator back to the first floor.
No matter what, he said, the show 
must go on.
“A lot of people work to make a 
play, and I was very impressed by that,” Ulbing said.

YARMOUTH, Mass. — Like many people who 
get summoned to jury duty, Jacob Clark didn’t 
want to go.
But unlike most people, he had a legitimate ex-
cuse — he’s 9 years old.
“I was like, ‘What’s a jury duty?’” Jacob told 
the Cape Cod Times in response to his summons to appear in Orleans District Court in Massachu-
setts on April 18.
His grandmother told him it was a good excuse 
to miss a day of school.
His dad called the jury commission office to 
find out what happened. 
It turns out that someone had apparently typed 
1982 for the Yarmouth third-grader’s birth year in-
stead of 2002. The mistake was quickly corrected.

UF guard Kenny Boynton (1) ended a recent slump with 20 points in Sunday’s 84-50 victory against 
Norfolk State. Boynton had been held to single digits in three of the four previous games.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
 
OMAHA, Neb.   — In his 16 years 
at Florida, Billy Donovan has yet to 
find an end-all cure for a shooting 
slump.
After watching Kenny Boyn-
ton — the Gators’ leading scorer at 
16.1 points per game — get held to 
single digits in three of his last four 
games entering Sunday, Donovan was amazed to see the junior guard almost magically snap back with a 20-point performance against Nor -
folk State.
“I have no idea why Kenny Boyn-
ton went through a shooting slump there and then all of the sudden, he 
gets a drive to the basket and knocks 
down his first three and gets going offensively,” Donovan said. “Some-times that’s hard to figure out.”
For a high-volume 3-point shooter 
like Boynton, the solution to ending his scoring struggles before Florida earned a berth to the Sweet 16 this week was easy: just get closer to the 
basket.
While Boynton continued a four-
game, 5-for-23 slide from behind the 
arc by hitting only 2 of 7 3-pointers against the Spartans, he ended the 
Gators’ 84-50 win 5 for 5 on layups 
and jumpers.
The five field goals from 2-point 
range were the most Boynton has made in one game since Florida played LSU on Jan. 21.
“Pretty much, I tried to do a bet-
ter job of attacking the rim,” Boynton 
said. “I think I attacked the rim, and 
I tried to get a foul early in the game, and it kind of put me in a rhythm.” 
Boynton’s high-percentage shoot-
ing within the 3-point line during 
the tournament coincides with the 
rest of the Gators, who have made a living lately on every shot other than a three.
Florida has been an inconsistent 
3-point shooting team at times this year and hasn’t bucked that trend going into the postseason. 
The Gators followed a 50 percent 
shooting night from three against Kentucky in the Southeastern Con-ference Tournament by hitting 17.4 percent and 37.5 percent on 3-point-ers in their first two rounds of The 
Big Dance.
“We’re a better shooting team 
than what we’ve shown maybe the 
entire season,” Donovan said. “I think we really have been a streaky team in a lot of ways.”Donovan pleasantly surprised by Boynton breaking slump
� UF FACES BAYLOR AT 7:05 
P.M. ON ESPN2.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Heading into the second round of 
the NCAA Tournament, the Gators feel 
like an afterthought.
Even after upsetting No. 8 seed 
Ohio State in the first round Sunday, ninth-seeded Florida is not expected to beat No. 1 seed Baylor and advance to 
its first Sweet 16 since 1998.
The Gators (20-12) play the Bears 
(35-0) tonight at 7:05 on ESPN2.
“Honestly, since I’ve been here, 
we have been the underdog,” guard 
Jaterra Bonds said. “I feel like no one respects us, so we have to go out there and take the respect.”
Historically, the odds are not in 
Florida’s favor against Baylor — No. 1 seeds are 32-2 against No. 9 seeds since the women’s field was established in 1982, and the Bears enter the game as 
22.5-point fa-vorites.
However, 
Azania Stew-art takes con-fidence in 
the Gators’ under-the-radar victory against a Buckeyes squad that won 25 games this season.

State and really didn’t give us any Gators face tall challenge

When Marcus Roberson left Florida’s game 
against South Carolina on Nov. 12 with a neck 
injury, coach Will Muschamp said he thought the then-freshman cornerback would be side-lined for about a month with a neck strain.
But when Florida’s medical staff walked 
into Muschamp’s office the following day to 
deliver the prognosis, the Gators’ coach real-
ized the injury was worse than he imagined.
“Yeah, it was,” Muschamp said Monday 
when asked if Roberson’s injury was consid-ered a career-threatening one. “It was scary; it really was. Any time you deal with the head and the neck, football is over, as far as I’m con-cerned.”
According to Muschamp, who couldn’t give 
the exact medical term for Roberson’s injury, the former four-star prospect had “displace-ment” in his neck. Roberson had to wear a brace to stabilize his neck for six to eight weeks, followed by a less-confining brace for six more 
weeks, Muschamp said.
The loss was big for Florida. Roberson 
earned a starting job in the 
defensive backfield dur -
ing fall camp and started in the season opener against Florida Atlantic. In 10 starts, Roberson recorded 22 tack-les, broke up two passes, 
had one interception and 
recovered a fumble.
He did not take the sea-
son-ending and career-threatening injury well.
“Marcus is a competitor,” Muschamp said. 
“Any time you take that away from somebody, it’s very frustrating. He was hurt; he was down — bad. I was worried about him just as a hu-Roberson making long-awaited

Preston Tucker Wins Weekly Award
The senior outfielder took home SEC Player 
of the Week honors for the first time after hitting .400 in UF’s four victories last week.UF W omen’s 
Bask etballAs Virginia and Norfolk State keyed 
on Florida’s 3-point shooting, the Gators 
found success inside. UF made 24 of 30 
shots from inside the arc in a 71-45 victory 
Friday against the Cavaliers, followed by an 18-for-25 effort two days later to beat Norfolk State by 34 points.
Along with Boynton’s four free throws, 
the Gators also capitalized on fouls from 
aggressive drives by Er -
ving Walker, who made 8 of 9 from the char -
ity stripe, and Brad Beal, who also had four made free throws. 
“The one great expe-
rience that we’ve gone through is shooting the 
ball like we did against Virginia,” Donovan said. 
“We still won by 20-plus points, and we 
were 4 for 23 from three. I think the same for the Norfolk State game.”
The result was the two largest margins 
of victory in this year’s NCAA Tourna-ment and an opportunity to play No. 3 seed Marquette in Phoenix on Thursday at 10:17 p.m.

In the Gators’ biggest win of the season, 
coach Amanda O’Leary was bothered.
On March 7, UF picked up its first victory 
against a ranked opponent as it defeated 
No. 15 Georgetown, 12-9, in Washington D.C. However, Florida turned the ball over 
a season-high 19 times in the process.
“We didn’t play well getting the ball 
out of our defensive end the whole game,” 
O’Leary said after the game. “I would love to say we made the adjustments and we 
were able to figure it out.”
Nearly two weeks later, the adjustments 
have been made, and the results have shown. 
The Gators have decreased their turnovers in every game since the win against the 
Hoyas, notching 16 against Temple, nine 
against Stony Brook and eight against Wil-
liam & Mary.
No. 4 Florida (8-2) will try to continue 
its recent success protecting the ball against 
No. 8 Dartmouth at 6:30 tonight at Donald R. 
Dizney Stadium. 
Dartmouth is UF’s first ranked opponent 
since Georgetown.
Junior attacker Gabi Wiegand, who had 
five goals against the Hoyas but also turned the ball over twice, said the Gators’ turnover 
issues stemmed from not only forced passes in transition but from a lack of patience on offense as well.
“The coaches talk a lot about patience,” Wiegand said. “We are so excited when we get the ball that we’re just ready to go and keep pounding it at the other team, and sometimes we shoot when we shouldn’t be.”
Eight of UF’s turnovers against George-town came on the defensive end. O’Leary pointed to both inaccurate passing from the 
defenders and a failure by the midfielders 
and attackers to cut back to the ball. 
After Florida had just eight turnovers in 
a 21-8 win against William & Mary, O’Leary said the defense made great strides in its 
decision-making.
“Our defenders have taken a little more 
pride in possession of the ball,” O’Leary 
said. “They are eliminating attackers and not just throwing the ball up for grabs.”
O’Leary said the transition opportunities 
that can lead to turnovers are hard to simu-
late in practice because of Florida’s roster 
size, so each player has to take it upon them-selves in games to get in position to get the 
ball from defenders.
She singled out Wiegand after the win 
against William & Mary for cutting back to 
the defensive end to receive passes. 
“We’ve been working for each other,” 
junior midfielder Brittany Dashiell said. “If 
someone gets double-teamed there is always 
an outlet to help them out, and we’ve just all 
gotten to be better ball-handlers.”
Against the Big Green, O’Leary said the 
Gators will have to play cleanly in transition because Dartmouth has the athletic ability to 
take advantage of any mistake.
“They are very physical,” O’Leary said. 
“They put a stick on a body. Through transi-tion we are really going to have to take care 
of the ball because they have some very fast 
attackers and midfielders.”

Stewart said. “It’s time to start 
talking about Florida — what 
[we] have done and what [we] are going to do.”
If the Gators are to upend 
the Bears, the game plan starts with stopping Brittney Gri-ner, the Big 12 Player of the Year. Griner leads Baylor with 23.1 points, 9.2 rebounds and 
a nation-leading 5.1 blocks 
per game this season. She also ranks third nationally with 1.31 points per shot, and she is fifth in the nation with a 61.4 field-goal percentage.
Griner is the best player 
Florida will face this season, but Stewart is confident in her 
ability to go toe-to-toe with the 
Bears’ 6-foot-8 junior center.
“She is very mobile for a big 
player,” Stewart said. “But, for 
me, I have played in the [South-eastern Conference], and I’ve played overseas against Olym-pians who are just as big and just as skilled as her.”
Stewart has spent the last 
three summers playing basket-ball in Europe in hopes of earn-ing a spot on the Great Britain National Team for this year’s Olympics. During her time overseas, Stewart said she went up against several big players from different countries, in-
cluding a 7-footer.
“Well, I played against the 
Russians. They’re kind of big. 
… They play in and out from the start, so it’s kind of just like a Brittney Griner,” Stewart said. “The Germans play pretty big and the Lithuanians. So, I’ve had experience that maybe a lot 
of USA players haven’t had.”
While UF will hone in on 
Griner much like it did against 
Ohio State’s Samantha Prahalis on Sunday, Baylor is a better all-around squad.
Nationally, the Bears rank 
second with a 1.35 assist-to-turnover ratio, third in scoring 
with 78.9 points per game and 
fifth in points allowed with 51.2 per contest.
The Gators are 1-7 in games 
in which they score 60 points or fewer.
“(Baylor) coach (Kim) 
Mulkey makes it very simple,” coach Amanda Butler said. “She 
puts her players in position for 
them to succeed. And they play their roles out very well within the structure [Mulkey] provides them.”
The last time the Gators 
faced the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, UConn defeated UF for a 28-point vic-
tory in 2009.
In order to avoid a similar 
blowout defeat, Butler says 
Florida will take whatever “ex-tra fuel” it can get.
“We rarely have gone into 
matchups against the best teams without people writing in the headlines about our op-
ponents,” Butler said. “Typical-
ly we are reading the headlines about our competitors and what our chances are. I think that it is good mental preparation for that for [tonight’s] game.”14, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, MARCH 20, 2012

To be the best, you have to beat the best. 
Bob van Overbeek hasn’t quite done that yet. 
No. 10 Florida’s top singles player lost his 
fifth straight match Monday, with four of those 
five losses coming against players ranked in the top 50. No. 61 Van Overbeek lost 6-1, 6-2 to No. 2 Steve Johnson of Southern California 
on Monday, part of a 6-1 loss to the No. 1 Tro-
jans.
Now 5-7 on the year, van Overbeek’s record 
is not a true reflection of his play. The fact that he has played in the top singles spot in every 
dual match this season speaks to his ability. 
Both van Overbeek and Florida coach Andy Jackson agree the level of competition has played a major role in his losing streak.
“He’s been playing the best player from the 
other team,” Jackson said. “Like any coach will say, if you know who wins the match, you may-be are missing way more information from the match than you’re gaining, because you have 
to take into account who you’re playing.”
Last year, van Overbeek played the major -
ity of his matches on court four, with a few on 
court three. This year, he was asked to step up 
to the top spot. He said that one of the biggest 
changes from last year is that he must consis-tently prepare to face the best players in the nation.
“I’ve been playing up and down a lot,” he said. “The guys I’ve been playing against are all really good. I’ve just got to practice more and improve on some things. The level of play of the people I was playing last year and in the 
fall is a lot different than the people I’m play-
ing in the spring.”
The junior’s teammates were unable to pick 
up the slack after USC’s court one victory. 
The Trojans clinched the match with Roberto 
Quiroz’s court six win against Billy Federhofer (6-2, 6-3)  and Yannick Hanfmann’s court five victory against Florent Diep (7-5, 6-2).
Spencer Newman picked up UF’s sole point 
with a 6-2, 6-3 victory on court four against Emilio Gomez. 
While van Overbeek’s losing streak would 
be discouraging to many, Jackson said that he 
hopes van Overbeek learns from it. Playing at 
the top singles spot is a big challenge, but the coach said that a tough stretch like this will de-fine a player’s season. 
“Whenever you’re in that situation, it’s ei-
ther going to make you better or it’s going to break you,” Jackson said. “I’ve found him to be a very resilient guy, but time will tell.” TUESDAY, MARCH 20, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 15

�THE GATORS WENT 7-7 IN MID -
WEEK GAMES LAST YEAR.

It would be easy for the Gators to 
stretch their weekly Monday off day 
into Tuesday. 
After all, the team that will fill the 
opposing dugout at McKethan Stadium tonight at 7 is not what most would consider a legitimate threat to beat No. 
1 Florida (19-1). Samford is 13-7 this 
year against a schedule that has not in-cluded a single team ranked in the top 25. 
This scenario is not unfamiliar for 
the Gators. 
“I don’t think you go into it with a 
mindset of feeling (overly relaxed), but 
I think it tends to happen kind of on its 
own,” senior Daniel Pigott said before the season of midweek games. 
The matchup with Samford is sand-
wiched between a Southeastern Con-
ference opening-weekend sweep of 
Vanderbilt and a three-game rematch of last season’s College World Series finals. It’s the ultimate test of concen-
tration for the Gators, who will leave 
Wednesday for Columbia, S.C., and a meeting with South Carolina, the team that ended their national championship dreams last June. 
“The fact of the matter is when we 
get back together on Tuesday it’s time to move forward and move past this weekend,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said after Sunday’s 8-2 victory. 
Last season, midweek games were a 
minor blemish on an otherwise stellar 
year for Florida. 
The Gators lost eight times in 30 SEC 
games in 2011, yet they lost seven of 
their 14 midweek games — including a 
4-5 mark once SEC play began. Myriad 
reasons can be used to explain losses to teams like UCF and Jacksonville. 
Four of Florida’s five midweek loss-
es during SEC play came on a Tuesday, 
meaning the Gators had to turn around 
and play after a weekend series against the likes of South Carolina, Missis-sippi State or Vanderbilt — all teams 
that made it at least as far as the Super 
Regionals in 2011 — and a mandatory Monday day off. 
For Florida, midweek games are gen-
erally about survival and getting reps for lesser-used relievers, while those Tuesday games are a chance to make a statement for smaller in-state programs.  Tonight, the Gators will start freshman 
right-hander Johnny Magliozzi, who 
has not seen action since a March 7 out-ing against Florida A&M. 
Pigott believes senior leadership will 
keep the Gators from falling into what seemed like traps last season. 
“We had such a great team, and we 
dropped a few games that maybe we shouldn’t have,” he said. “I think we’ll 
be more mindful of that this year. This 
year, we’ll be probably better equipped to figure it out and notice when it’s hap-pening and nip it before it happens.”Top-ranked UF trying to avoid midweek letdown vs. Samford“The level of play of the people I was

UF junior tennis playerman being. He was really , really depressed 
about the situation.”
  Roberson worked with Florida’s medi-
cal staff, going through “every test you could imagine,” and he was cleared to return to 
practice with limitations this spring. Roberson 
wears an orange non-contact jersey during practices, but that didn’t stop him from getting into tussles with receivers like Quinton Dun-bar in drills during the weekend. Muschamp said the contact during drills was just “shad-ow boxing,” and that Roberson won’t be par-ticipating in any serious contact this spring.
Johnson moves to backﬁ  eld: Coaches 
moved sophomore Chris Johnson to running back this offseason after he played both line-backer and safety as a freshman. Muschamp referred to Johnson as a “tweener” on defense but has been impressed by his physical nature — part of the reason for the switch.
  “He was a guy that was a good back in 
high school and a guy that’s got some explo-sive power,” Muschamp said. “Let’s give him 
that opportunity to take a shot. We’ve been 
pretty pleased so far.”
Dunbar called out: After Dunbar struggled 
to produce as a redshirt freshman last season, Muschamp challenged him in front of the team during the weekend and expects him to have a larger impact as a sophomore in the fall.  “(It’s important) to make sure everybody 
understands what our expectation level is and that we’re all on the same page,” Muschamp said. “It’s important to [call players out] in front of the whole group.”
  Injury report: Wide receiver Stephen Alli 
(groin) and defensive lineman Earl Okine (back) are day-to-day , while wide receiver Solomon Patton (groin) is week-to-week and 
will not partake in this weekend’s scrimmage, 
Muschamp said.
  Cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy (sprained 
shoulder) was expected to practice Monday.
  Tebow on the block: According to reports, 
the Denver Broncos are expected to try to 
trade former Heisman-winning quarterback 
and ﬁ  rst-round draft pick Tim Tebow.
  The Broncos are in contract negotiations 
with four-time NFL MVP Peyton Manning, who was released by the Colts on March 7. Manning’s arrival likely means an end to “Tebow Time” in Denver, despite Broncos vice president of football operations John El-way saying in January that the former Florida 
standout would be the team’s starting quarter-
back heading into training camp.
  Tebow took over the starting job in Denver 
after the team started 1-4. He led the Broncos to a 7-4 record in their ﬁ  nal 11 regular-season games and a playoff win against the Steelers before losing to the Patriots.
