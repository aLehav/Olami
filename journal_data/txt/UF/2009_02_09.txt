The state’s highway fatali-
ties have dropped to the lowest 
number since 2000, according to a 
Florida Highway Patrol release.The Florida Department of 
Highway Safety and Motor 
Vehicles data on highway acci-dents showed 2,986 traffic fatalities for 2008 compared with 2,999 for 2000. 
The numbers for the two years are similar, but Florida’s popula-
tion grew by more than 2.8 million 
over those nine years, the release stated.
In 2007, the number was 3,221.For Alachua County, there 
were 57 fatalities in 2007, up from 44 in 2000, according to the Florida 
Department of Highway Safety 
and Motor Vehicles Web site.
County data for 2008 has not yet 
been released.
Florida Highway Patrol spokes-
man Lt. Patrick Riordan said a combination of factors played a 
role in the decrease.
Factors included enforcement 
of current traffic laws and public 
relations campaigns that spread Fla. highway deaths lowest since 2000STATE

A Gainesville man was charged with 
murder after allegedly killing his girl-friend with an aluminum baseball bat early Saturday.
The Gainesville Police Department 
responded to a 10:30 a.m. call from Travis Mingo, 33, who said he found his girlfriend’s body lying on her bed.
When GPD arrived to 436 S.E. 24th 
Terrace, they found Mondrecia Lillie dead. Her unharmed 6-month-old son was next to her, the report stated.
Lillie had severe blunt head trauma 
to the back of her head and a bruised up-
per back, the report stated.
The blood  spattered on the walls 
and ceiling was consistent with a violent 
strike from a bat, the report stated.Mingo first told police he didn’t know 
what happened, the report stated.
GPD spokesman Keith Kameg 
said Mingo initially tried to be a Good Samaritan by calling in a crime.
“After a multi-hour interview with 
Detective Bennie Smith, Mingo confessed to kill-ing her,” Kameg said.
Mingo and Lillie were 
living together as domes-
tic partners, the report stated.
He told police that after arguing with 
Lillie, he struck her on the back of the head with the bat. Afterwards, Mingo 
went to the store, leaving their 6-month-
old and Lillie’s 9-year-old daughter alone, Kameg said.
Mingo has previously been charged 
for burglary, weapons and drug viola-tions and has spent time in the state prison, Kameg said.Man confesses to

One fest’s famine is another fest’s 
feast. Langerado, a Miami-based music 
festival, was canceled Tuesday, the same 
day that Harvest of Hope, a festival in St. Augustine, released its line-up.                                                         
However, Langerado’s demise meant 
changes for Harvest of Hope.                              
Headliners The Faint and Ra 
Ra Riot dropped. They can’t justify the trip to Harvest of Hope, which raises money for migrant worker’s 
rights, without the pay they would have received from Langerado, said Ryan Murphy, an event coordinator.                                                             
However, Gaslight Anthem and Black Kids have signed on to the Harvest of Hope ticket after being freed up from Langerado.                            
“I really feel bad for the guys at 
Langerado,” Murphy said.                                                                    
But Murphy hopes that people who 
had planned to go to Langerado will 
come to Harvest of Hope instead.                                                  
Langerado was canceled because 
ticket sales were slow, according to the 
festival’s Web site.  The festival was Langerado canceled

 TEAM FLORIDA TOOK SEVEN 
OUT OF THE TOP 10 POSITIONS.
BY EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Writer
Local cyclists exchanged their sweat-
ers for spandex Saturday for the two-day 
Swamp Classic.
The Classic, a series of bicycle races 
where cyclists of all skill levels competed for points, prizes and prestige, wound through the tree-lined roads of Archer and kicked off the Southeastern Collegiate Cycling Conference season.
The riders and teams do not compete 
against one another directly — rather, they try to finish as fast as possible to earn 
points for their teams in hopes of earning 
enough to go to the national competition held in May, said Joel Hackman, a UF student and Team Florida’s sponsorship coordinator.
The event, hosted by UF’s Team 
Florida Cycling, continued Sunday with collegiate and open races, in which rid-ers raced around city blocks that had been 
closed to traffic in downtown Gainesville.
Members of Team Florida triumphed 
in various categories, taking seven out 
of the top 10 positions — including first and third — in the Collegiate A race and first and second position in the Collegiate Women’s race. 
Bobby Sweeting, a UF student who 
is a member of both Team Florida and a 
professional team sponsored by Toshiba, 
won a 55-minute collegiate race Sunday, earning points for his team just hours before competing in a 65-minute profes-sional race. 
Hackman said that Team Florida is 
lucky that Sweeting is so devoted to his school and team.“All he got was glory and points for 
our school,” he said of Sweeting. “It’s like a recreational tennis player having access to Roger Federer.”
According to Sweeting, the feeling is 
mutual.
“UF is fortunate to have a lot of really, 
really strong riders,” Sweeting said. “We can go out there and really put the screws 
to some people and do well.”
Team Florida is sponsored in large 
part by local companies, including Chain 
Reaction Bicycles, and national compa-nies like Clif Bar and the anti-chafing cream AsMASTER, as well as the City of Gainesville, according to Hackman.
Hackman calls Gainesville a “mecca 
for cycling in the state 
of Florida,” citing 
Gainesville’s mix of city atmosphere and 
country roads as the perfect combination for cyclists.
The Swamp Classic was not without 
incident — cars sometimes clogged the road on Saturday, and a wayward scooter and allegedly stolen car were brief distrac-
tions on Sunday’s course. But the overall 
demeanor of the cyclists was remarkably mellow. 
Alexis Dabroski, who won the 
Collegiate Women’s race by almost an entire lap, stayed relaxed despite working full time as a firefighter while attending graduate school at UF.
“People are here cheering me on,” she 
said. “I know that no matter how bad I do, they’re going to be here supporting me.”
She also attributes her success to her 
teammates.
“I definitely couldn’t have done it 
without them,” she said. “People would have chased me down and brought me back in. It’s great to have a strong team out there.”UF cyclists sweep races

Alligator Contributing Writer 
The UF Libraries Web site, uflib.
ufl.edu, has been redesigned to make 
it more user-friendly and aestheti-
cally pleasing. The new home page 
was released today for public test-ing and will be officially launched on Feb. 16.
“We created a new home page 
with the user in mind,” said Matthew Daley, co-designer of the site. “It’s very unique and very colorful.”
The current site will have a link 
to the new page, which was created in about six months, Daley said.
According to Michele Crump, 
interim director for UF’s Technical Services Management Group, the current Web site has not been up-dated for more than two years and was due for a change.  
“There was too much informa-
tion for people to really find things,” Crump said. “There were lots of 
links, and we think it was confusing 
to the user. We’re trying to make it simpler.”
The new design aims to highlight 
frequently used areas like online journals and databasesThe site will also feature special 
displays, news items and events. 
“People will have a week to look 
at it, try some things out and send some comments to our Web mas-ter,” Crump said. “It’s a work in progress.”
So far, the site has received mixed 
reviews. Iona Malanchuk, a librarian at 
UF’s College of Education, doesn’t mind the difference.                                                                  
“We’re in the world of comput-
ers, which means constant change,” she said. “I believe this is a sincere attempt to improve things.”
Others, however, are worried 
about how the change will affect us-ers.                                  
“Once we do our instruction and 
show folks how to navigate the site, it can be confusing for them when it changes in the middle of a semes-ter,” wrote Pat Reakes, librarian at the journalism school’s Allen H. Neuharth Library, in an e-mail. 
Daley said although the timing is 
not ideal, releasing the site now will provide  time for user feedback and further improvement.
Crump said users should be able 
to add a personal touch to the Web site this summer. “[The Web mas-ter] is designing a page that you can make your own ‘my library,’“ 
Crump said.  The feature would al-
low users to bookmark certain jour-nals or pages they frequently use, she said.
The redesign did not cost 
UF any money, Daley said.

 CREDITS HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
ADJUSTED FOR FRESHMEN.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
UF has changed its policy to accept more 
incoming credits from high school exams af-
ter learning it was in violation of a statewide regulation.
The violation may have resulted in stu-
dents taking classes they had already earned credit for in high school.UF sent an e-mail Friday to about 3,200 cur-
rent students who were affected by the policy change said Steve Orlando, UF spokesman.
Before the change went into effect, UF ac-
cepted up to 30 credit hours from Advanced 
Placement, International Baccalaureate, 
Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE) and College Level Examination Program (CLEP) exams.
UF will now accept up to 45 credits from 
these exams.                                                                           
Orlando said UF made the change to com-
ply with a Florida Board of Governor’s regula-tion that went into effect about 3 years ago.
“The Board of Governors brought it to our attention that it needed to be fixed, and we fixed it,” he said.
The board governs the state’s 11 public uni-
versities. UF has already adjusted the credit hours for the freshman class, Orlando said. 
He said UF urged all oth-ers who may be affected to contact their academic advisers. He said there was 
a slim chance the violation may have delayed graduation dates for some students.
“It’s conceivable but, you know, they prob-
ably already made up the difference anyway, so it really wouldn’t have affected anybody,” 
he said.The violation may have also caused stu-
dents to pay for classes they would have had 
credit for if UF had been in compliance with the regulation.
When asked for comment on the possible 
financial impact on students and the state, which pays tuition for more than 70 percent of UF’s undergraduates through Bright Futures, Orlando said he didn’t think the policy had af-fected many students.
It’s unusual for students to come in with 
more than 30 credits, he said.
Bill Edmonds, board spokesman, said there 
is usually no penalty if a university fails to im-
plement a regulation. UF will now accept 45 credits from outside exams

attempt to improve things.”

258 TOTAL VOTESU.S. defense spending a budget busterColumn
Credit Crunch
The tough economic 
times can make people do pretty crazy things.
Gainesville businesses are 
closing up shop. UF can’t af-
ford to pay its electric bill. 
Untenured faculty are getting 
the boot in round after round of layoffs.
Even the Editorial Board 
has considered switching to an all-Easy-Mac diet to con-serve our ever-dwindling money stash.
Understandably, UF’s  
administration is looking for new ways to save cash.
The newest stop on their 
budget-cut train is to allow in-coming students to bring in 45 hours of Advanced Placement and dual enrollment credit from high school. Previously, the cap was set at 30 credits.
We can understand their 
reasoning. Students will prob-ably graduate quicker and take up fewer seats in classes like Freshman Comp. Fewer warm bodies equates to fewer class sections, so UF won’t have to spend as much money  to pay faculty and keep those pesky lights on.
Also, accepting more out-
side credit will be mutually beneficial  —  UF can pad its statistics and high-school 
overachievers can pad their 
transcripts. But, may we ask, why must this change be blamed on budget cuts?
If increasing the cap will be 
so beneficial to students and university alike, why didn’t UF always allow students to bring more credits in with 
them?
It seems now more than 
ever a lack of funding is be-
coming the scapegoat for unpopular or otherwise un-savory decisions. A small lib-eral arts program is taking up valuable research money? Cut it. Tenured faculty can enjoy 
the job security while adjunct 
lecturers toil in basement of-fices. 
We understand things 
need to be cut and changed, after all, the university is a liv-ing and breathing thing. But we just wish the UF would stop blaming their unpopular 
decisions on funding.We’ve all been there before.
Every college student has fallen asleep with their 
Facebook page open after a long night of drinking 
only to later discover their profile chock full of interesting ad-
ditions.
From a change in sexual preference to new interests in-
cluding “pole-dancing” and “one person garage parties,” the Editorial Board has seen it all.
While pulling a prank on an unsuspecting buddy’s Facebook 
page won’t exactly end a friendship, the growing issue of Facebook impersonation is no laughing matter.
According to a report on CNN, criminals are hacking their 
way into people’s Facebooks and posing as the individual. Once they take over the account, the crook will post a status update 
saying that he or she is in some sort of trouble. Usually what 
ensues is that a kindhearted friend will respond to the plea by wiring money to whom they believe is their friend in need.
One incident left a good Samaritan out over $1,000 after 
sending his friend money upon hearing he had been mugged while vacationing in London. Unfortunately for the man who thought he had done a good deed, his friend was safely at home in Seattle.
The Editorial Board encourages you to be careful with your 
Facebook account. We aren’t trying to sound like your mom and dad, but we’d hate to catch word someone hacked into your ac-count because you used a disturbingly obvious password like “gators.”  We want you to have fun “networking,” but be sure to play safe.
The United States of America allocates more funds 
than all other countries combined to defense spend-ing. It’s a statement I’ve heard before but never re-
ally believed. 
Take China, Russia, India, Germany, France and every 
other state army in the world combined, and we outspend them. We’re No. 1. In 2008, our country spent $479.5 bil-lion on defense before spending any money on the actual War on Terror. In comparison, the entire European Union spent nearly $312 billion on defense. China spent $60 bil-lion. Russia spent $50 billion. Iran? As of 2005, the gulf 
state spent a measly $6.3 billion.  
How much were we spending at the height of the Cold 
War, right before the USSR collapsed? Roughly $500 bil-
lion in 2007 dollars, and former President Ronald Reagan was already echoing former President Jimmy Carter’s 
premonitions of a vast military-industrial complex taking 
over our defense department. Today, we spend more on 
defense and the War on Terror than what we spent at the height of the Cold War, when Reagan asked George Lucas if he could write the next “Star Wars” script.  
Proponents of our massive defense spending will 
rightly argue that the defense budget under Reagan was roughly 6 percent of the GDP, as today our defense bud-get is only 3 percent of our GDP. We may still spend the same amount of money, but our economy has grown since Reagan left office, and so we spend a smaller amount of our economy on defense. That’s true, but when did radical terrorists become the Red Army?
Do we really need another multibillion-dollar naval 
warship when we’re fighting in a desert? Can we only spread the gospel of democracy by outspending every other nation-state’s defense budget? Why can’t Congress break out the budget scalpel and start trimming the fat? Of course, no hawkish 
Republican congressman or congresswoman will ever suggest trimming the defense budget. That’s essentially a sacrilegious suggestion if you belong to the Grand Old Party. Unfortunately, the GOP’s congressional counter-parts also lack the cojones to break out the budget chisels. 
Why? Members of our armed forces are voters, too. 
There’s a psychological benefit to having the most ex-
pensive armed forces in the world. There’s even an eco-nomic benefit: somebody has to build and supply the parts for the F-22s, F-35s and other instruments of warfare. 
Yet, our economy is now in the gutters. Our GDP 
shrunk 3.8 percent last quarter alone. Last Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that unemployment has now risen from 7.2 percent to 7.6 percent. Congress wrangled all last week to compose an economic stimu-lus bill, and senate democrats finally reached a compro-mise with republicans to trim the bill. What did they cut? Education, of course.
Meanwhile, the Defense Department has requested a 
larger budget this year, so that we’re again poised to fight another great superpower.
When the next biggest defense spender are the com-
bined nations of the European Union, I have to wonder who exactly our real enemy is? 
Must be the French.

shows why it’s important for all UF stu-dents to vote in the Gainesville city elec-
tions on March 24. 
Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa 
was a leading voice for the new solar en-ergy plan, which allows residents and 
companies with solar panels to sell back energy to GRU. Similar programs overseas 
have generated profits for consumers and 
have been wildly successful in promoting renewable energy adoption.  
In addition to her energy work, 
Mastrodicasa has been a strong advocate for students and our community, work-ing on public safety, economic growth and 
equality for all.

More ‘green’ sex tips available
Thanks for the “green” sex tips in 
Friday’s issue. Sure, some people like it dirty in the bedroom, but we shouldn’t 
have to sacrifice a clean planet to satisfy 
our sexual desires.
If you want more sustainable sex tips 
other than turning out the lights and buy-ing PVC-free toys, Gators for a Sustainable 
Campus is dishing out info on going green in the bedroom at our general meeting on 
Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. in CSE E119.

n n nUF women exhibit terrible towel use
I’m writing to express my disgust for 
bathroom habits at UF. While I’m happy that most of us wash our hands before 
leaving the bathroom, I am appalled by the amount of paper towels that women 
find necessary to dry their hands. Friday 
in the library, I saw a girl use four paper towels, when you only need one. Let’s try 
to conserve not only our resources, but our 
usage of space in landfills. It’s a simple thought to not be wasteful.

Guest column
Dear Nu’Keese,
I’m sure your life has been 
quite a whirlwind in the last 
few days, and the notoriety you 
have gained may not be so welcome. 
I’m writing to offer you some advice 
that you may want to consider. 
I think it is clear to most observ-
ers your life has become caught up with some people who may not have your best interests in mind. I’m not referring to Nu’Keese Richardson the football player, I’m referring to Nu’Keese Richardson the human 
being. Because of the ugly and in-
credibly public way your recruit-ment has been dramatized, you run the risk of being branded by it for the rest of your college career or even longer. You may no longer simply be Nu’Keese Richardson the football player, you will be famous for your involvement in this episode, deserv-edly or not. 
When you step on the football 
field, you may become a target for those who would otherwise have no reason to single you out. They may simply use you as a proxy for their enmity against your head football coach and your institution.
From public accounts, your be-
havior in this episode was far from exemplary. And while the actions of 
those who recruited and guided you 
in this episode were reprehensible, you need to accept responsibility for your actions as well. 
Your decision to change schools 
was certainly appropriate. It’s your life. And while the p r o c e s s you went through in 
making the change wasn’t one to be proud of, you are certainly not alone in that imperfection. 
What makes your situation 
unique, Nu’Keese, is the way your recruitment was used as a pawn by your head coach to try and demon-strate his value as the leader of the Tennessee football program. While 
there is quite a consensus as to the 
impropriety of the comments them-selves, I don’t hear much commen-tary about how all of this impacts the young man unwittingly thrown into this storm. I think it’s clear your coach did not consider this impact heavily when making his com-ments. 
You alone can determine how 
best to go forward from here, but a 
little advice may be in order. If you 
were my brother, I’d suggest the fol-lowing:
First and foremost , apologize to 
your family and those in your com-munity for your breach of trust with them. These are the people who have supported you and will be there for you in the future when the chips are 
down. Secondly, I think you should 
seriously consider enrolling in a uni-versity outside of the Southeastern Conference. With your talent, there would be no shortage of schools willing to take you on. The consequences of this episode 
will not die away quickly and with no intent on your part, when people see you at UT, they will think of your recruitment and see you as a symbol 
of your head coach’s identity. This 
will be both on campus and on the football field.
It occurs to me that this situa-
tion has made you famous in some respects and might make you pretty popular in a lot of circles at UT. But in the end, I think you’ll be better off making a name for yourself based 
upon your own accomplishments 
than via a sad situation like this.
The choice is yours, but that’s 
what I’d tell you if you were my brother.
Rich Kleinman is a UF alumnus.
Nu’Keese should stay away from Southeastern Conference

Speaking Out8, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2009 MONDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2009  ALLIGATOR, 9
By LAUREN HANTMAN                                     
Alligator Contributing Writer                                                             
UF macroeconomics professor 
Dave Denslow appeared in front of 
the Florida House of Representatives  
Feb. 4 to share his take on the econo-
my and its effect on Florida.                                                              
In an interview Thursday, he said 
the state’s economic future is uncer-tain and Floridians should expect a deeper recession than the rest of the nation.  He also addressed the com-parisons drawn between today’s economy and the Great Depression.
“I don’t think it’s going to be as 
bad as the Great Depression,” he said. “Having gone through that ex-perience, we have learned from it.”               
While a similar credit crunch led 
to the crisis of 1929, he said, that situa-tion was worsened by a trade war.
Some worry a trade war could arise from the stimulus package’s proposed “Buy American” clause, Denslow wrote in an e-mail on 
Sunday.
This clause mandates that feder-
ally funded projects use U.S.-made 
products. The clause is meant to sup-
port American companies, but some 
argue the provision violates estab-lished trade agreements and might spur other countries to cut U.S. im-ports. Financial management professor 
J o e l  H o u s t o n  a g r e e s  w i t h  D e n s l o w .                                                                           
“I think there is a significant chance 
that this recession will be deeper and longer than any we have seen in our lifetime,” Houston wrote in an e-mail. “I don’t expect that this downturn will be as bad as what was observed during the Great Depression.”                                                    
Still, Houston wrote he was not 
convinced the worst is over for Wall Street, citing substantial losses.                     
 While some students think the 
economy is to blame for the tough job market, others think panicking may be harmful, such as UF engineering graduate student Jonathon Jeske.                                                              
“People are worsening the effects 
by propagating the idea of an im-pending depression,” Jeske said.                                                  
But according to Denslow, the re-
ality is that Florida will see a worse economy than its fellow states in the short run.
“We’re experiencing a more se-
vere housing crash than the country 
overall,” Denslow said.                                 
Florida also faced the second-
largest decrease in employment 
during 2008, after 
California, accord-ing to The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Web site.
Despite this, 
Denslow said Florida’s long-run prospects are com-paratively higher 
because of the warm climate, tourism and retirees.                   
As the Baby Boomer popula-
tion ages, more retirees will strain Medicare and Social Security, he said. 
But Boomers will help Florida’s econ-
omy as they flock to the Sunshine state. Currently the recession is ex-pected to last through the third quar-ter of this year   — this summer, he 
said. Then, he expects things to flat-
ten out.                 
Neeta Thoguluva, a UF finance 
senior, agreed with the forecast and said President Barack Obama’s plans and the stimulus package will soon help the economy.                                            
Denslow said upcoming gradu-
ates will have a hard time getting a 
job, but UF students will have an ad-
vantage due to the prestige of their alma mater. He advised students to build their resume by taking courses that teach analytical, writing and cre-ative-thinking skills.                                                      
“You can take the easy route 
through this vast university and not learn a thing,” he said. “Choose easy 
classes and you’ll get a degree that 
means nothing.”                                                              
Denslow speaks before House on economic issues
Denslow
awareness of laws and instilled good 
driving habits, he said.
Last year, one campaign focused 
on the Move Over law, which is de-signed to help emergency vehicles 
travel on highway shoulders to aid 
in accidents.
All drivers are not aware that 
they’re supposed to move out of the way or slow down when they see flashing lights behind them, he said.
The FHP also partnered with dif-
ferent state and local agencies for community traffic programs.
The programs help agencies pro-
tect drivers, Riordan said.
“We can learn from other agen-
cies,” he said. “We can put our heads together and address future problems.”
But Riordan added that highway safety starts with drivers.
People cannot send text messag-
es, put on makeup, adjust the radio or eat and drink while they drive, he said.
Drivers must also control their 
speeding and keep a safe distance 
between their vehicles and others. 
Traditionally, a ve-
hicle should keep a car-length of distance 
per every 10 mph between itself and the vehicle in front of it
He said if a car speeds at 100 
mph, it can travel the length of a football field in three seconds, which is dangerous if other cars are not go-ing that fast.
Still, Riordan said the most im-
portant thing drivers can do is re-member the basics: Wear a seatbelt.
“My angle is to let people think 
a little more about their driving,” he said.
Riordan said he hopes to see fa-
talities continue to drop. A recent state law increasing fines for traffic violations could make a difference.
Although the law is designed to 
help state budget problems and it is too early to know the effects, people may drive safer if they know a $200-plus fine awaits them, said Florida 
State Rep. Chuck Chestnut in a 
phone interview.
In terms of the state’s budget 
problems, the biggest issue is keep-ing enough officers and highway patrols to enforce traffic laws. 
The number of fatalities could 
increase if there isn’t enough law enforcement to catch violators, he 
said.
“Just on my way to Tallahassee, 
I was going about 70, and people 
passed me like I was sitting still,” he said.Reinforced laws lower number of fatalities
held in the Everglades in 2008, and the switch to Miami this year turned off many would-be festival-goers.                                    
Many fans feel that the move 
to Miami, where there is no camping,  led to low sales. 
“When it was in the 
Everglades, that was an amaz-ing festival,” said UF zoology senior Scott Clayman, who has attended Langerado several times. “It was perfect.”                                                            
Hillary Cassel, another fes-
tival-goer and a UF graduate, said that the new location put it out of some peoples’ budgets.
“Hippies who are saving up money for the festival can’t af-ford a hotel on Miami Beach,” she said.
Among bands slated to play 
at Langerado were Modest 
Mouse, Death Cab For Cutie, 
The Pogues, Public Enemy, Against Me! and Girl Talk.
In 2008, the early bird tickets 
started at $170 and at-gate tick-ets were $225.                                                 
This year tickets started at 
$120 and were $165 at cancel-lation. Cassel said the lower prices were not convincing.                                     
“Making it a little bit cheaper 
doesn’t make up for no camp-
ing,” she said. “Camping is one 
of the best things about a music festival.”Festival changes line-up
NewsState“I think there is a significant 
chance that this recession 
will be deeper and longer 
than any we have seen in 
our lifetime.”

The Tigers (7-2, 2-2 Southeastern 
Conference) dropped the Gators (3-2, 2-2 SEC) to 0-2 in road meets this season.
UF opened the meet on its stron-
gest event, uneven bars, but didn’t start as strong as it would have 
liked.
Due to some landing problems, 
the team scored a season-low 48.975 
on bars. Amanda Castillo and  Maranda Smith both led the team with 9.9s. 
Melanie Sinclair caught her foot 
on her first release, bumping her score down to a 9.675. Sinclair scored a perfect 10 on the same event in the Jan. 30 meet against Kentucky.
“I honestly don’t think the slow 
start on bars really affected us,” Smith said. “We’ve competed for so long, and we’ve gone through meets 
where there’s been slow starts. We 
know how to handle the situation because we have experience.”
Despite the slow start on bars, 
the team rebounded with a 49.175 on vault, with lineup scores ranging from 9.8 to 9.85.
Sinclair had one of the team-
leading 9.85s along with freshman 
Nicole Ellis.
“We typically depend on bars to 
be our go-to event — that we’re real-ly going to capitalize on getting the high scores. They came back strong 
on vault,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said.
The Gators moved to floor exer-
cise, where they turned in their sec-ond-best performance of the season, a 49.325.
Corey Hartung and Smith led the 
lineup with 9.9s, marking Smith’s 
second 9.9 of the night.
Castillo also made her first ap-
pearance on floor this season. The 
two-time SEC floor champion has been hampered by bursitis in her 
ankle and hasn’t performed as much 
as usual in order to rest up for the latter part of the season. She scored a 9.575.
“(Castillo) said she really want-
ed to go,” Faehn said. “She had to start somewhere. I thought that was great. I thought that was really a positive step for her.”
UF closed the meet on balance 
beam, a troublesome event for the Gators this season.
While the Gators didn’t score 
remarkably high, they showed im-provement from previous weeks, and the team’s 48.35 was the second-highest score on beam this season.
The meet was held up after the 
judges trimmed Courtney Gladys’ beam score. Originally a 9.825 rou-tine, Gladys had to settle for a 9.525 after the judges assessed a three-
tenths neutral deduction when the 
springboard wasn’t removed after Gladys’ mount.
“The scores weren’t justified,” 
Gladys said. “I still think we, over-all as a beam group, I think we did great.”
While this meet marked an im-
provement from past meets, the 
team is still having consistency is-
sues, Faehn said.
“We still are finding that we are 
having difficulty just putting it all together all at once,” Faehn said. “We’re finding that at each meet it’s something different — a different mistake or a different athlete on a different event. 
“So it’s really kind of frustrat-
ing, and I know it’s frustrating for them.”
Gators stumble at LSU in year’s second road loss
She scored 12 straight points for 
UF, including back-to-back threes and a three off the backboard to reverse the score from a 7-point Tennessee lead to a 3-point swing 
in UF’s favor.
“It meant a lot to everybody, 
just to show everybody that we are 
who we say we are,” Brooks said. “That we really go out and we try to get a win. We don’t just put on a show. We just don’t put on a jersey just because it’s got Florida on the jersey.”Up 57-55 with the ball and com-
ing out of a timeout with 1:25 re-maining, Steffi Sorensen gave the Gators some separation.
The junior 
hit a three from the corner off an 
inbounds pass 
from Brooks that put UF up 
by 5.
“Steffi’s slip-
pery,” UF coach Amanda Butler 
said. “Great shooters find ways to get themselves open.”
The Volunteers failed to an-swer on the next possession, miss-ing the front end of a 1-and-1, and the Gators iced the game on free throws.
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt 
couldn’t help but comment on the performance of Brooks and UF.
“She’s a heck of a player,” 
Summitt said. “That’s a tough chal-lenge, but I’ve got to give her a lot of credit. When they needed points, she provided it. This Florida team is playing really well together. They’ve got a veteran group that understands a commitment to de-fense, to rebounding and to sharing 
the basketball.”
Brooks’ 12 consecutive points fuel victory
his hitters after the game, Walton noted the excellent 
pitching of Baylor’s ace, who held the Gators to just seven hits and one earned run in her 13 innings of work over the weekend.
“(I would tell my team) we don’t face Whitney 
Canion again until maybe the end of the season, so good job and good luck,” Walton said. “Everybody’s going to be gunning for you all year long, and this is what it’s going to be like.”
The Gators also struggled at the plate against 
Canion in Game 1 but prevailed 3-0 thanks to Kelsey Bruder’s fourth-inning home run and some uncon-ventional scoring.
Enea crossed home plate on a passed ball in the second inning, and catcher Kristina Hilberth put UF up by 2 on another passed ball when Canion at-tempted to intentionally walk Enea in the bottom of 
the third.
Nelson threw her 37th career shutout, struck out 
eight and only walked one batter despite giving up 
two hits to the first two Bears she faced 
Friday.
“I wish I could say it was jitters. I 
think I was just missing my spots,” Nelson said after Game 1. “I wasn’t re-ally in game mode yet. I wasn’t jittery, 
but I needed to settle down and get into my zone.”
UF appeared to be back on track Saturday in 
Game 2, scoring 8 runs on nine hits while sophomore Stephanie Brombacher (1-0) pitched six scoreless in-nings. Nelson gets 37th career shutout in Game 1And while this one cer-
tainly won’t hold any sort of asterisk, it must be pointed out that this is not one of Tennessee’s better teams. 
Coach Pat Summitt has 
won 1,000 games and eight NCAA titles. She likely won’t be winning her ninth this year.
This was the first time UF 
ever entered a game against Tennessee as the higher-ranked team (No. 11 vs. No. 
12).
But taking down the giant 
still means a lot, especially in 
the game of women’s basket-ball, where parity is not com-mon.
“There’s no question 
Tennessee does set the stan-
dard,” Butler said. “You al-
ways know that Tennessee is going to be a contender to win our league and a contender to win the national champi-onship. That’s just how it is in women’s basketball.”
And Sunday was going to 
be huge, win or lose. ESPN2 televised a women’s game from the O’Connell Center for the first time since 2002.
UF was able to get the 
crowd it wanted, filling the seats with 8,060 people, the 
second most in program his-
tory.
The biggest attendance 
mark, not surprisingly, came from another UF-Tennessee affair. That game was on Feb. 11, 2001, when the No. 2 Volunteers came to Gainesville to face the No. 6 
Gators.
The 12,222 fans in atten-
dance watched Tennessee 
blow out UF 103-73.
This time, UF responded 
under the lights.
In Summitt’s first game 
since her 1,000th win, she got outdueled by Butler’s Gators 
in a game that emphatically 
put them in the national spot-light to stay.
“Is (defeating Tennessee) 
something to be excited 
about? Oh my gosh, I grew 
up in Tennessee,” said Butler, a native of nearby Mt. Juliet, Tenn. “Are you kidding me?  I went to the Pat Summitt basketball camp when I was 15 years old.”
Looks like she learned 
well.VOLS , from page 16

ONLINE POLL QUESTION HOT SHOTSHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF guard Sha Brooks pushes her way past Tennessee’s Briana Bass during 
the Gators’ 66-57 win in the O’Connell Center on Sunday night.
Before coaching her first game at UF, 
Amanda Butler talked about lofty goals.
She talked about championships, own-
ing the home court and “climbing the 
Tennessee mountain.”
It sounded an awful lot like optimistic 
“coach speak.”
This was a Gators program coming off 
a 9-22 record in its 2006-07 season. UF had 
defeated Tennessee only two times in 39 meetings.
Better make that three wins in 40 meet-
ings after UF beat Tennessee 66-57 on 
Sunday.It’s time to say 
Butler may have 
known what she was talking about.
Last year, she 
used pretty much the same roster as the nine-win squad but turned it into a 19-win team.
Now, the Gators have their best start 
in program history through 24 games 
(22-2) and are tied with Auburn atop the Southeastern Conference standings.
UF will likely move into the top 10 of 
the AP poll this week after earning its 
fourth win against a ranked opponent. 
If the Gators can get through road 
games against Vanderbilt and LSU this week, they should earn a No. 3 seed (or better) in the NCAA Tournament.
Oh, and about that whole owning the 
home court thing? The Gators are 13-0 this year and 27-5 in the two seasons under Butler.
Through it all, Butler will say Sunday’s 
victory is just another win.Butler’s rebuilding of program nears completionBy CHRISTOPHER YAZBEC

The stage was set. The script was written. All UF 
needed was a hero.
Sha Brooks filled the role perfectly.The senior guard posted 29 points and played 
the emotional leader the No. 11 Gators needed to 
knock off No. 12 Tennessee 66-57 on Sunday in front 
of 8,060 screaming, blue-clad fans in the O’Connell Center.
The win, in front of the second-largest crowd 
in school history, keeps UF (22-2, 8-1 Southeastern Conference) tied atop the SEC with Auburn nine games into the conference season.
Brooks, who has averaged more than 20 points 
against the four ranked opponents UF has faced this 
season, scored nearly as many points as the rest of 
her team (37) against the Volunteers (17-6, 6-3 SEC) despite only shooting 10 of 18 from the free-throw line.
She proved again that she plays 
her best in the big games.
“I basically just took what the de-
fense gave me,” Brooks said. “It was a lot of teamwork.”
For Brooks, who hails from 
Jackson, Tenn., it was obvious from 
her emotions and what she said after the game how important getting this win was to her.
“It’s just something about wanting to beat 
Tennessee,” Brooks said. “Not saying that I don’t want to beat every other team, but I really, really want to beat Tennessee.”
The Gators, wearing black jerseys at home for the 
first time this season, had a real size disadvantage and were outmatched at every position.
UF used balanced scoring from eight different 
players and stingy defense in the first half to go into the locker room down just 29-27 at the break.
Tennessee appeared to be in control in the sec-
ond half after guard Angie Bjorklund hit a three at the shot-clock buzzer to put her team up 6 with 10:25 left.
Brooks decided at that point it was time to save 
the day.Gators knock off powerhouse Vols

Even the No. 1 team in the nation 
can stumble out of the gate.
The UF softball team won the first 
two games of its three-game series against Baylor at home this weekend 
but fell 1-0 on Sunday in Game 3.
The Gators (2-1) outscored the 
Bears (1-2) by 10 runs over the week-
end, but Baylor freshman pitcher Whitney Canion (1-1) struck out 10 batters and held UF to three hits in seven scoreless innings in Game 3.
The Gators won 19 straight games 
to start the season last year.
“We’re going 
to have to hit. We can’t get shut out,” UF coach Tim Walton said. “There’s no way 
a team like this, with the offense we have, gets shut 
out. I think that’s 
where I put all the 
blame and all the guilt — it’s on the nine hitters in the lineup who didn’t come through today.”
Senior pitcher Stacey Nelson (1-1) 
only gave up one hit on the day, but the Bears capitalized on two costly fifth-inning errors by the Gators and 
took a one-run lead from which UF 
could not recover.
“It’s always disappointing when 
you lose, but I’m not going to freak out about one loss in the first week-end of the season,” Nelson said.
UF had its best chance to score in 
the first inning with Kim Waleszonia on third and Aja Paculba on sec-
ond after a sacrifice bunt by Ali 
Gardiner. Canion responded by forcing Francesca Enea to foul out and striking out designated hitter Tiffany DeFelice.
Waleszonia attributed the team’s 
lack of offensive production to the hitters not adjusting to what they saw from Canion on Friday night or 
in their first at-bats Sunday.
