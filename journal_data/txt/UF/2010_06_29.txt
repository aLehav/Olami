SPORTS 17Tennessee man arrested after breaking into house, falling asleep on couch
DYERSBURG, Tenn. — Police arrested 
a man who fell asleep after breaking into 
a home. 
The Dyersburg State Gazette reported 
that residents returned home and found the 22-year-old man asleep on the couch.
Terry McCreight, an investigators for 
the Dyer County Sheriff's Department, said officers determined that the man once lived in the residence but had been asked to move.
Police said he broke a window and 
kicked in the door of the home while no-body was there on Thursday. 
Deputies arrived and took him into cus-
tody on without incident.
He was charged with vandalism and 
aggravated burglary.

Florida is the second-ranked athletic pro-
gram in the nation, according to the final stand-
ings for the Learfield Sports Directors’ Cup.
The standings, which will not become of-
ficial until the conclusion of baseball’s College 
World Series this week, use a points system 
based on an individual sports’ final rankings to determine the school with the most success in all NCAA sports.
Regardless of the outcome of the College 
World Series, the Gators will remain ranked No. 2.
Florida had 10 teams finish with top-five 
rankings this year, according to Mary Howard, associate athletic director for communications.
Florida has 21 varsity teams, while Stanford, 
which won the award for the 16th consecutive year, has 31.
The standings use each university’s top 
10 rankings from men’s sports and the top 10 rankings from women’s sports.
This year, the Gators won national cham-
pionships in women’s swimming and diving and men’s indoor track and field, as well as 
second-place rankings in women’s tennis and 
men’s outdoor track and field.
 “Every sport at the University of Florida is 
trying to finish as high as possible,” said How-ard. “So I don’t think there is going to be any 
extra emphasis on any specific sports.”
To beat Stanford, Florida would have need-ed the equivalent of three more national cham-
pionship wins.
Last year, the Gators took the third-place 
spot, as Florida had six teams ranked in the top five.
The Gators are the only team in the South-
eastern Conference to finish in the top 10 for the Learfield Sports Directors’ Cup. Tennessee is the next highest SEC school at No. 13.
The Gators won seven SEC championships 
in team sports this past year, earning Florida the SEC All-Sports trophy sponsored by the New York Times Regional Newspaper Group in May. 
It was Florida’s 20th time in 23 years that it 
won the trophy.
Although Howard said she doesn’t see a di-
rect correlation between the Gators’ all-sports rankings and ticket sales, she said successful sports programs brings more fans.UF finishes second in all-sports rankings

ON CAMPUS

Alligator Writer
Smoke ‘em if you’ve got ‘em 
Gators, because in a couple of 
days, tobacco on campus will be 
a thing of the past.
Starting Thursday, UF will en-
force a new smoke-free campus policy, designed to encourage 
healthy lifestyle choices among 
students, staff and visitors.
UF is the first public univer-
sity in the state to adopt such a 
policy, although there are at least 
394 campuses nationwide that adhere to such strict standards, according to the American Non-smokers’ Rights Foundation. 
The policy prohibits the use 
of any tobacco products, even smokeless products like snuff or electronic cigarettes. 
The ban applies to all UF-
owned facilities, including those outside of Alachua County. To-bacco users will also be prohib-ited from using products in their 
cars on any campus parking lot or road. It also applies to univer-
sity-recognized locations on the 
UF campus, such as fraternity 
and sorority houses. 
The policy is part of the 
Healthy Gators 2010 Initiative, which is dedicated to promoting 
a healthy campus environment, 
according to UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
If caught using tobacco, viola-
tors will be reminded of the poli-cy and asked to comply. Students who refuse will be dealt with by Campus tobacco

 WASHINGTON — Saying the 
U.S. is no longer “racing against 
an adversary,” President Barack Obama called Monday for greater international cooperation in explor-ing space.
  Obama said in a statement that 
the U.S. seeks peaceful collaboration 
with other countries that will ward 
off conﬂ  ict and make it easier to ex-pand exploration. The United States must do more to address debris and other hazards in space, he said, and called for a “burgeoning commercial space industry.”
  Peter Marquez, the White House 
director of space policy, said the ad-ministration is returning to a policy that existed before George W. Bush was president that would entertain 
the possibility of a treaty to limit 
space-based weapons. He didn’t say the Obama administration would pursue such a treaty, but he wouldn’t slam the door against the idea as the previous space policy had.
  The language is similar to that ad-
opted by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, 
Marquez said.  Russia and China in the past 
have made vague proposals about 
limiting weapons in space and the U.S. has always opposed it.
  No country has deployed space 
weapons, but there is an issue of at-
tacking satellites from the ground, 
as China did its own 
satellite and the U.S. did to a dying sat-ellite in 2008, said 
Laura Grego, a senior scientist on global security at the Union of Con-cerned Scientists.
  The U.S. space program began in 
the late 1950s as a competition with the Soviet Union, a longtime Cold War enemy. 
In his statement, Obama said 
America’s imperatives and obliga-tions in space have changed in re-cent decades.
  “No longer are we racing against 
an adversary,” he said. “In fact, one of our central goals is to promote peaceful cooperation and collabo-ration in space, which not only will ward off conﬂ  ict, but will help to ex-pand our capacity to operate in orbit and beyond.”
  Most of the civilian side of the 
space policy was already announced by Obama in February and April, in-cluding a dramatic turn for the hu-man space exploration. Instead of aiming for a return to the moon, the Obama space policy is more geared to Mars with a stop ﬁ  rst at an aster-
oid by 2025.
  Even the exploration plan has 
more of a tinge of international co-
operation. 
Ofﬁ  cials said they are talking 
with the Chinese government about including them in U.S. space efforts — such as the International Space Station — but there is nothing con-
crete yet.

UF Hillel is turning the sun’s en-
ergy into cash.
With the recent installation of 
more than 200 solar roof panels, the 
Jewish center on University Avenue is the first non-profit organization to take advantage of Gainesville Regional Utilities’ feed-in-tariff pro-
gram.
The program allows landown-
ers to build solar panels on their 
own property and lease the panels’ energy output to GRU, which buys the power from the businesses or residents at a rate of 32 cents for each kilowatt hour generated.  
“It’s a win-win situation for ev-
erybody,” said Keith Dvorchik, UF Hillel’s executive director. “We’ve basically become a power source, and GRU buys the energy from us.” 
UF Hillel applied to join in March 2009, four days after GRU offered 
the program, he said. 
Although UF Hillel is the first 
non-profit organization to get on 
board, 36 local organizations have already installed solar panels and are using the feed-in tariff.
Although popular in Europe, 
the feed-in-tariff system is relatively rare in the United States.
GRU is the only feed-in-tariff 
provider in Florida, Dvorchik said.
UF Hillel paid nothing for the 
purchase or installation of the pan-els, he said, as an anonymous donor bought the panels.  
The implementation of the feed-
in program may have helped GRU win a nationwide award this week.           
The American Public Power As-
sociation gave GRU an E.F. Scatter-good System Achievement Award, which goes to power companies that exhibit outstanding customer service. 4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 29, 2010

� DONORS WILL RECEIVE A T-SHIRT.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Tania Alonso said she loves Edward 
Cullen so much she’s giving up a pint of 
blood just to see him from a better view. 
Alonso, a self-described “Twilight” fa-
natic, is donating her blood in a drive held 
by LifeSouth Community Blood Centers 
before the release of “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse” at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.  
LifeSouth decided to have a drive for the 
third installment in the “Twilight”  series, 
“Eclipse,”  after a successful drive for the 
series’  second film, “New Moon.”Clay Gibbons, district community de-
velopment coordinator for LifeSouth, said the success of its last vampire-themed drive was huge. He hopes to duplicate the suc-cess of that drive. 
In exchange for a pint of blood, do-
nors with tickets to “Eclipse”  will receive 
a “Team Edward”  or “Team Jacob”  shirt, 
will get to skip the line to the movie and will have reserved VIP seating to see the movie. 
Gibbons said people should donate early 
because reserved seating is limited.    
The drive will be held today from 6 p.m. 
to midnight in the Regal Butler Plaza Cin-emas 14 parking lot, 3101 SW 35th Blvd., where the movie will premiere. Donors will be able to choose to donate from either a Jacob bus or an Edward bus.
Edward is the film’s central vampire 
character and Jacob is the main werewolf character.
Alonso, a 22-year-old family, youth and 
community sciences major at UF, said she is “Team Edward all the way,”  and is looking 
forward to her free T-shirt. 
She is trying to recruit peo-
ple to attend the blood drive. “It’s for a good cause and you get something good out of it, 
as well,” Alonso said.
Gibbons said it’s important to support 
this drive because 20 to 25 percent of its donor base comes from students, and when they leave for summer break, the center loses donations.The center especially needs O-negative 
donors, according to its website, lifesouth.org.
Gibbons said donating blood gives peo-
ple the opportunity to save or affect the 
lives of others in the community.
He said the center needs about 100 do-
nors per day. He believes 60 to 80 people 
will attend the drive. 
Alonso said she donates because she 
wants to be able to help others. 
“As long as I can donate,” she said, “I 
will donate to save someone else.”
To donate, you have to be 16 or older, 
weigh at least 110 pounds and have a photo ID. Sixteen-year-olds must bring written parental consent to donate. Blood bank seeks donors at ‘Twilight’ movie premiereHillel adds panels for

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
A lawsuit against the Vatican that had been 
dismissed as a publicity stunt moved forward 
when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from the Holy See. Monday’s devel-opment represents a significant advance for 
what many believed to be a long-shot claim 
that the Vatican bears legal responsibility for molester priests.
The high court’s decision not to stop the 
lawsuit means the clergy sex abuse case will go to trial in an Oregon district court.
“I have known for 25 years that all roads 
lead to Rome,” said Jeff Anderson, the Min-nesota attorney who represents the plaintiff. 
“This is the beginning for us of a new journey, 
a uniquely difficult odyssey.”
Anderson, who has represented hundreds 
of abuse victims and has tried for years to sue the Vaitcan, said he hoped to persuade a judge that he should be allowed to depose Vatican officials.
Jeffrey Lena, the American attorney for the 
Holy See, argued the Vatican is not respon-
sible for individual priests in dioceses, saying 
the existence of the priest in the case “was un-known to the Holy See until after all the events in question.”The original lawsuit, John V. Doe v. Holy 
See, was filed in 2002 by a Seattle-area man who said the Rev. Andrew Ronan repeatedly molested him in the late 1960s.
Anderson argues in the case that priests are 
Vatican employees for the purpose of Ameri-can law. If the trial judge agrees, that would constitute an exception to the Foreign Sover-
eign Immunity Act, under which the Vatican 
has been immune from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.
A lower court judge previously ruled there 
could be enough of a connection between the Holy See and Ronan for him to be considered a Vatican employee under Oregon law. 
That ruling was upheld by the 9th U.S. Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals.
Lena had asked the federal courts to throw 
out the lawsuit.
“The Holy See does not pay the salary of 
the priest, or benefits of the priest, or exercise 
day-to-day control over the priest, and any of 
the other factors indicating the presence of an employment relationship,” Lena said.
According to the lawsuit, Ronan, who be-
longed to a religious order, began abusing boys in the mid-1950s as a priest in the Archdi-ocese of Armagh, Ireland. He was transferred to Chicago, where he allegedly admitted abus-ing three boys at St. Philip’s High School.
Ronan was later moved to a parish in Port-
land, Ore., where he was accused of abusing the person who filed the lawsuit now under appeal. He was removed from the priesthood in 1966, according to the Archdiocese of Port-land, and died in 1992.
The Obama administration had sided with 
the Vatican on the issue of sovereign immu-nity.
The acting U.S. solicitor general, the U.S. 
State Department and the U.S. Justice Depart-ment filed a brief with the Supreme Court ar-
guing that the case does not meet the standard 
for an exception to immunity.
Douglas Laycock, a religious liberty spe-
cialist at University of Michigan Law School, said the brief will be influential as the case proceeds.
“The courts give substantial weight to the 
State Department’s views on foreign sover-eign immunity issues,” Laycock said.In 2005, the administration of President 
George W. Bush argued the pope should have immunity from a lawsuit accusing him of con-spiracy to hide abuse because the pontiff is an acting head of a foreign state. Soon after, a fed-eral judge dismissed the case.
However, Steve Rubino, a New Jersey at-
torney who has represented abuse victims 
since the 1980s, argued that the court could 
react differently now that the scope of clergy sex abuse is better known. The case against the Vatican is proceeding as European churches, Vatican officials and Pope Benedict XVI are engulfed by the latest crises over clergy sex abuse.
Rubino said that when he first took up 
abuse cases, diocesan attorneys often won by 
arguing that First Amendment religious free-
dom protections meant that civil courts could not interfere in church business. That approach rarely works any more.
“The world has been affected by a slow re-
alization of the depth of the scandal,” Rubino said. “Judges react the same way. People are tired of this.”
A separate lawsuit filed in Louisville, Ky., 
and still in the courts, contends the Vatican is responsible for U.S. bishops who failed to stop priests from molesting children.
Sex abuse lawsuit against Vatican moves forward

Soccer Sham
The break between sum-
mer semesters was quite eventful if you 
were a soccer fan. The U.S. team made it out of group play and into the Round of 16 in the World Cup before falling to Ghana in an elimi-nation game.
The loss was heartbreak-
ing for die-hard supporters of our national team, but it was hard to tell the differ-ence between legitimate dis-appointment and tears from bandwagon fans while sifting through Facebook statuses 
this past weekend.
We’re not sure, but it 
seems like the people who are 
crying the most after the U.S. loss are the same ones who ask why the clock counts up and does not stop. When we had to share bar space with these people during games, we were unsure whether to balk at their ignorance or em-brace their sincerity. Unfortu-nately, it got bad enough that we chose the former.
We want to set things 
straight: Soccer is not like the Olympics. You cannot just walk in without knowing anything about the sport and go for your national team, complaining the entire time about the lack of an instant-replay system. It is annoying. 
Starting today, all you 
guys who jumped in line to cheer for the U.S. team have four years to learn something about the sport other than 
that using your hands is not 
allowed. Even though we would be delighted if people took a little more initiative in learning the sport, we have a sneaking suspicion that the only reason the World Cup was so popular this year was that  people were just looking for an excuse to drink at 7:30 a.m.Long-haul fight
Miami flights will help 
Gainesville airport
Flying out of Gainesville is a chore. Not because Gainesville Regional Airport is lacking, but  because to get anywhere from our tiny airport requires you to fly 
into the veritable labyrinth that is Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
Aside from requiring a 5K running time under 15 minutes 
to make it across the sprawling hub for a connecting flight, the Atlanta airport seems to emit a magnetic field that causes all manner of mechanical glitches and inopportune flight cancellations. If we didn’t know any better we would say it was all a racket to force people into staying overnight and touring the Coca-Cola Co. plant.
Come Oct. 1, though, it will be possible to fly to almost 
anywhere in the country out of Gainesville. Thanks to a deal 
between Gainesville Regional Airport and American Eagle 
Airlines, the regional affiliate of American Airlines, two round-trip flights to Miami will be added to the daily flight schedule. 
While it might not make sense on paper to fly hundreds 
of miles south in order to catch a flight to New York, Chi-cago or Los Angeles, believe us when we say it will save a lot of time in the long run. It will probably save the average traveler money when the cost of over-priced airport food and magazines are factored into the inevitable delay in Atlanta.
We don’t have anything against Atlanta – it’s an alright 
city. But we are not too eager to fly through it unless it is our final destination. That said, we are counting down the days to when flying out of Gainesville is a little less painful.
Smoking ban encroaches on rights
There is something very unsettling in the way modern 
society is beginning to parallel the fictional worlds pre-sented by writers such as Orwell, Huxley and Rand. 
From the disturbing similarities between contemporary texting language and Orwell’s Newspeak to the health care 
battles that still continue to rage in Congress, it is undeniable 
that, at some point in the last 50 years, the line between fact and fiction began to blur.
These novelists’ prophetic visions continue to frighten 
and enthrall us for more than just the apocalyptic drama they paint within their pages – much of what was written is indeed coming true, possibly by our own unconscious need to indulge in self-fulfilling prophecies. 
It is a well-known fact that we, as a society, are extremely 
susceptible to the lures of mob psychology. From the xe-nophobic tendencies we exhibit toward the influx of im-migrants to the more recent green movement that seems to has swept through not only college campuses but through the very heart of Suburbia, we are unable, when together, to exhibit anything other than the traits of the timeless adage “Monkey see, monkey do.”
From the time we are children until adulthood, we want 
to be part of the group, to be liked, to be popular. But the 
question, of course,  behind the innate drive to seek this pop-
ularity is: Am I doing what is right, and if so, at what cost?
On July 1, the statewide properties of UF, including its 
home base right here in Gainesville, will be banning the use of any and all tobacco products on campus. 
In the policy made available on the university’s website, 
“’tobacco use’ means the personal use of any tobacco prod-uct, whether intended to be lit or not, which shall include smoking ... as well as the use of an electronic cigarette or any 
other device intended to simulate smoking and the use of 
smokeless tobacco, including snuff; chewing tobacco; smoke-less pouches; any other form of loose-leaf, smokeless tobacco; and the use of unlit cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tobacco.”
In lieu of quoting statistics, as is often done with the con-troversial issue of smoking and the ef-fects of secondhand smoke, it is more important to focus on the ban’s socio-logical effects.
Ever since the statewide smoking bans in enclosed work-
places were enacted seven years ago, those Floridians who choose to smoke have been ostracized and demonized by contemporary society. Deemed modern-day lepers, smokers have slowly been cast into the role of cancer’s errand boy, with tobacco farmers and those who work for tobacco com-panies as drug smugglers and harbingers of death.
Indeed, advertising and the media have convinced us of 
the effects of secondhand smoke. By standing within 10 feet of anyone who is smoking we will surely and quickly bring 
about our own demise. UF is no different. This ban is poised 
to create a division between smokers and non-smokers and draw the proverbial line in the sand.
Soon enough, it will no longer be considered wrong for a 
campus guard to stop a student and demand to investigate the contents of his or her bag under the pretense of suspi-cion. 
Soon enough, random raids of the dormitories by the 
university staff in order to discover illicit contraband will be 
considered necessary. And soon enough, the entire city of 
Gainesville may fall under the influence of the almighty UF, with designated “cessation centers” cropping up all across town in order to “re-educate” those naughty smokers and illuminate the errors of their ways.
And if you think, “Oh well, it’s bad for people anyway, 
why should anyone complain?” Remember, these are the first steps that lead to second steps, and those second steps may just be the ones that encroach on something you feel per-
sonally about. And if those second steps do not, then surely 
the third ones will.  Such is the way our own innate need to adhere to the unconscious desire for self-fulfilling prophecies continues to beguile us.

Residents should protest fire tax
I like the idea of everyone paying their fair share 
for fire services, especially for those properties that 
don’t have to pay property taxes. Unfortunately, as commissioners, finding additional revenue sources is like inviting a few roaches into your home. They 
will multiply before you realize what is going on.
The same is going to be true about your pro-
posed fire tax. Next it will be the police department 
tax, and so on. For a period of about five years be-fore the market crashed in 2008, the city and coun-ty’s tax receipts were way over expectations. That money should have been used for  something other than buying everybody new vehicles and padding the employee levels of all of your city and county 
departmental budgets. Now, rather than deal with 
the current austerity problem and face a mob of your employees you would rather face a mob of your citizens. The county backed off when its meet-ing to vote on a similar fire tax was a mob scene. It will be interesting to see how many more security personnel are deemed necessary at this meeting.
To my fellow voters: Show up to the July 15 
meeting at City Hall at 6:30 p.m. (live on Cox chan-
nel 12), and let them know how you feel about the 
poor management of our tax dollars.

Public education is the cornerstone 
of our nation’s economic might. 
When we make a true commit-
ment to educating a future generation, 
we are not only producing a workforce that is better equipped to tackle the 
problems of today, but we are planting 
the seeds for the innovation of tomor-
row. If we are going to prepare our children for the future, I believe Flori-da must change its course and make a 
proper investment in public education.
Our failure to make this investment 
triggers the scourges of every society: 
poverty, crime, discrimination. It’s our responsibility as a community to com-
bat these issues and make sure that ev-
ery child has the chance to succeed. We 
cannot do this when we put more of an emphasis on testing than teaching.
Tallahassee’s obsession with stan-
dardized testing has harmed our 
schools in more ways than can be 
counted. One glaring example has been in the recent failure by  Pearson Edu-cation Inc. to properly grade and code 
the FCAT on time. Rather than finding 
ways to improve our schools by putting money into the 
classroom, our 
state is invest-
ing hundreds 
of millions of dollars in testing – and getting a bad return.
The State of Florida pays our teach-
ers about $6,000 less than the national average and ranks 36th in terms of per child spending. We spend $20,108 per year to house an inmate in a Florida 
prison. Compare that to the $6,400 we 
spend on per student funding. These 
numbers reflect a disturbing trend that lead to only one outcome: we care more about locking people up then giving 
them an education.
We need an education policy that is 
not based on the principles of fear -- but 
instead seeks to keep the most talented educators in our state and inspires our 
children to be the innovators of tomor-
row.
When educators are instructed to 
teach only what is on a test, the ques-
tion needs to be asked: What is left out?  
This question should be in the minds 
of Tallahassee lawmakers before they pass harmful legislation like Senate Bill 
6, which would have only worsened 
the problem.
There will always be a need for 
proper academic guidelines and bench-
marks to ensure the quality of our edu-
cation system. But testing is not teach-
ing and when we use a rigid model 
to determine how much we pay our teachers or how much we fund particu-lar schools, it has gone too far.
If we want to get serious about edu-
cation reform, it starts with a partner-ship between parents, teachers and lawmakers - not a power grab by Tal-lahassee bureaucrats. As a product of 
the public school system, I know that 
the best ideas in education come from 
the classroom.
Turning Florida’s economy around 
begins with realizing that every dollar 
we spend in the classroom is an invest-
ment in a job market based on creativ-
ity and ingenuity. 
All it takes is the political will to 
make that happen.

noon. A campus-wide smoking ban goes into effect on Thursday.
the Dean of Students Office, while 
staff members will answer to their immediate supervisors. 
Repeat violators will face 
harsher consequences, although Orlando said punishment isn’t the emphasis. 
“There won’t be a direct penalty 
for violating,” he said, “but again, the goal is not to create a situation where we’re going to penalize peo-ple . . . but to encourage people to 
be healthier.”
Tobacco users may find the 
policy too strict, but it’s like older 
policies that prohibit people from 
smoking indoors, Orlando said.
“It’s going to be a cultural 
change over time,” he said. “It 
seems strange and outrageous to some people right now, but in a 
few years it will seem strange to 
have ever smoked on campus at all.”
D.J. Halford, 22, is an employ-
ee of Shands at UF and has been smoking cigarettes for years. He said changing his habits at work 
will be difficult and kind of annoy-
ing, but he accepts the university’s oversight.
“It’s like a res-
taurant,” he said. “I think they’re allowed to say what can and can’t be done on 
their property. 
It’ll definitely help me cut back, 
although I haven’t quit yet and I 
don’t really want to.”
The first phase of UF's tobacco 
ban began Nov. 1 at UF's Health Science Center and all Shands at 
UF facilities. Ben Hill Griffin Sta-
dium went smoke-free Sept. 5 by

SMOKE , from page 1� BUS RIDES WILL COST MORE.
By JORDAN DIAZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Shuttles providing transportation to and 
from Florida football games will have a new 
look this year when private bus company Fab-ulous Coach Lines takes over for the federally funded Gator Aider.  
The new service will be called Navigator, 
said Ray Land, owner of the Branford-based company. 
Unlike Gator Aider’s city buses, which 
were the same buses used by Gainesville’s Regional Transit System, Land said his luxury coaches will have restrooms, flat-screen televi-sions, storage space and leather seats. 
Single-game passes will be $10, up from the previous $8. A year-long, home-game pass will be $60, up from $40 last year. Students with 
valid IDs and children shorter than the fare box will ride free.  
“Our coaches will be better 
than what people are used to for only a small increase in price,” 
he said.
Land is also planning on providing service 
to away games, bowl games, Gator Growl and the SEC Championship, if the Gators qualify.
RTS buses did not provide transport to 
away games, and RTS Gator Growl passes were $6 each, according to Chip Skinner, RTS marketing and communications supervisor. 
Home-game transportation will have five 
different hubs: the Oaks Mall, the Southwest Downtown Parking Garage, the Hilton UF Conference  Center, the Village Center in Haile Plantation and Tioga Town Center. Private company takes over Game-Day bus shuttle

Orlando
� MOST GAS STATIONS ARE 
INDEPENDENTLY OWNED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Tension is mounting between 
BP and the neighborhood retailers 
that sell its gasoline.
As more Americans shun BP 
gasoline as a form of protest over the Gulf oil spill, station owners are insisting BP do more to help 
them convince motorists that such 
boycotts mostly hurt independent-ly owned businesses, not the Brit-ish oil giant.
To win back customers, they’d 
like the company’s help in reduc-ing the price at the pump.
BP owns just a fraction of the 
more than 11,000 stations across 
the U.S. that sell its fuel under the 
BP, Amoco and ARCO banners. Most are owned by local business-men whose primary connection to the oil company is the logo and a 
contract to buy gasoline.
In recent weeks, some station 
owners from Georgia to Illinois say 
sales have declined as much as 10 
percent to 40 percent.
Station owners and BP gas dis-
tributors told BP officials last week 
they need a break on the cost of the gas they buy, and they want help 
paying for more advertising aimed 
at motorists, according to John Kleine, executive director of the 
independent BP Amoco Marketers 
Association. The station owners, who earn more from sales of soda and snacks than on gasoline, also 
want more frequent meetings with 
BP officials.
“They have got to be more 
competitive on their fuel costs to the retailers so we can be competi-
tive on the street ... and bring back 
customers that we’ve lost,” says Bob Juckniess, who has seen sales drop 20 percent at some of his 10 
BP-branded stations in the Chicago 
area.
Owners and distributors put forth their demands at a meeting in Chicago with BP marketing of-ficials. BP’s reply could come as early as this week, says Kleine, 
whose group represents hundreds 
of distributors.
Station owners are locked into 
contracts that can last seven to 10 years in some cases. So, switching 
to a competing brand if BP refuses 
to help may not be an option.
BP spokesman Scott Dean de-
clined to offer specifics about the 
discussions when contacted by The 
Associated Press.
“BP is in daily contact with its 
independent distributors and fran-chisees and helping them manage 
the impacts the oil spill is having 
on their businesses,” he said.
Gasoline retailing trade groups 
say the boycott’s impact isn’t only 
evident in southern states such as 
Florida, Georgia and Tennessee, but also in places further from the spill like southern Pennsylvania. Jim Smith, president and CEO of the Florida Petroleum Market-ers & Convenience Store Associa-
tion, said BP has given some sta-
tion owners a one-cent-per-gallon discount, which “doesn’t amount to much.” Kleine told AP the dis-count appears limited to Florida. 
He declined to give the size of the 
discount that was requested at the Chicago meeting.
Websites and Facebook pages 
advocating a BP boycott popped up soon after oil started spewing into the Gulf in late April. Drivers only heeded the call when the spill’s full impact became apparent.
Paola Soldevilla, manager of a 
BP station in Pembroke Pines, said it was only when images of oil-soaked birds appeared in newspa-
pers that sales fell off. So sharply, 
in fact, that she won’t be getting her usual one-week paid vacation.Kevin Dalton can empathize. 
He owned a Citgo station when President Hugo Chavez made anti-American statements in 2006, lead-
ing to a boycott of the Venezuelan-
owned gas company. Sales of gas and in-store items dropped more than 50 percent. Sales at his Shell station in Palm Beach Gardens 
have increased 15 percent since the 
spill started in late April, but he says it’s hard to directly tie that to a BP station less than a mile away.
Last week, Vincent Connolly’s 
GPS guided him to a BP station off Interstate 480 in Cleveland. But he had second thoughts after filling up for $2.75 a gallon.
“You don’t want to support 
anyone that’s killing the environ-ment,” he said.
That connection to the destruc-
tion on the Gulf Coast concerns Juckniess, the Chicago station owner. He’s been running his own promos — free coffee and $2 off a car wash — but he wants BP to step up support of both the stations and 
the BP brand.
“We’re their branded market-
ers,” he says. “It would be foolish 
for BP to not support its branded marketers when clearly we can 
document that some of the loss 
that we’ve experienced is due to the incidents in the Gulf.”
The biggest hit comes not from 
lost gas sales but from lost con-venience store business. Owners like Juckniess make just pennies on a gallon of gas. But they might make up to 55 cents on a $1 cup of 
coffee. The margins on candy and 
chips are about 48 percent and 37 percent, respectively, Jeff Lenard of the National Association of Con-
venience Stores.
The boycott’s impact on BP is 
limited. The company makes most 
of its money exploring and produc-ing oil in places such as Angola, 
Egypt, the North Sea and the Gulf 
of Mexico.
“The corner store is the face of 
BP, but by no means how BP gets 
its money,” Lenard said.
And even if drivers opt to fill up 
at an Exxon or 7-Eleven, they still 
may buy BP gasoline. Because of the way gas is refined and market-
ed, BP fuel gets supplied to stations 
other than those with BP brands.
The boycott’s impact is felt less 
in rural areas, where people know the owners personally. And it helps to sell other necessities.
Dacia Radabaugh, who man-
ages a BP station owned by her parents in Williamstown, W.Va., thinks the station is as popular as ever because it sells liquor and cig-arettes to a regular crowd.
And of course some drivers are 
just more pragmatic.
“Gas is gas, buddy,” said Danny 
Sullivan, making no apologies for 
filling up at a Little General BP sta-
tion in Charleston, W.Va. “It don’t matter where it comes from.”

TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG POLL QUESTION UF FOOTBALLBy ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
The Gators’ trip to the College World Series 
may have been short, but they didn’t let it go 
to waste.
After two consecutive poor performances 
that led to a pair of losses against UCLA and FSU, Florida was eliminated before it could even enjoy Omaha, Neb.
But it won’t be long until it is back in the 
CWS.
“I think we are all foolish if we don’t pull 
something away from this and don’t try to improve and make ourselves better for next year,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “I can tell 
you we are looking forward to breaking in the 
new (CWS stadium) next year.”
The Gators are expected to lose just one po-
sition player next season, senior center fielder Matt den Dekker, from a lineup that won the Southeastern Conference regular season title. The New York Mets drafted den Dekker in the fifth round of the 2010 MLB Draft.
“I think we had a great experience (in Oma-
ha),” rising junior Preston Tucker said. “It was new to everybody on the team, so I think if we get back here next year we will be a little more confident.”
The corner outfield positions proved to be 
the two holes in the lineup this year. Daniel Pigott, Jonathan Pigott, Tyler Thompson and Kamm Washington combined to hit just 11 homers while picking up 69 RBIs in 456 at-bats this season.
In order to increase the team’s production 
from those two spots, O’Sullivan may plug Tucker into right field next year, while Austin Maddox takes over at first base.
O’Sullivan gave Tucker seven starts in right 
field this season and it was evident the first baseman needed some work before becoming an everyday outfielder. In the SEC Tourna-ment on May 27 he misplayed two balls and committed one error in right field.
“(Tucker is) a good outfielder,” O’Sullivan 
said after that contest. “We have a lot of confi-dence with him playing in right field.”
UF won’t be losing much on the pitching 
side either.
The weekend rotation of Alex Panteliodis, 
Hudson Randall and Brian Johnson will be back. However, the Gators will have to find a replacement for All-SEC closer Kevin Chap-man, who was drafted in the fourth round by the Kansas City Royals. But O’Sullivan is already preparing to fill 
those voids. After bringing in the No. 1 recruit-ing class in the nation last year, he is luring in another premier wave of talent.
According to Gators pitching recruit John-
ny Barbato, hurlers Jonathon Crawford (42nd round of MLB Draft) and Daniel Gibson (26th 
round), and third baseman Zack Powers (28th 
round), are all enrolled in summer classes at UF and have decided to pass on the MLB to play college baseball.
Barbato, who was picked in the sixth round 
by the San Diego Padres, is also enrolled in classes, but has not made a decision yet.“My decision is depending on how much 
money I am offered, and if I don’t get what I want then I’m not going to sign (with the Pa-dres),” he said.
The right-hander could end up being the 
prize recruit of this year’s class if he stays in Gainesville because Barbato expects pitcher 
Karsten Whitson (ninth pick overall) to sign 
his MLB contract. 
“In three years I think I can be a top talent 
in the country with O’Sullivan’s help” Barbato said. “So to me it’s either give me the money now or later, but as of now I am definitely leaning toward Florida.”

� THE STARTING GUARDS 
LED UF IN MINUTES PLAYED.

Backcourt depth could prove to 
be a problem for the Gators again 
next season.Last year, point guard Erving 
Walker and shooting guard Kenny Boynton were each forced to play a team-high 33 minutes per game be-cause of the lack of options at those positions. They might have to do the same this season, too.
“We still have a little bit of depth 
issues back there,” coach Billy Don-ovan said.
In the offseason Florida added 17-year-old guard Scottie Wilbekin, 
who will skip his senior year of high school to come to UF, and perimeter player Casey Prather, 
who played small 
forward in high 
school.
These two players will be the pri-mary backups in the backcourt after Ray Shipman decided to transfer to UCF in order to play football. 
With Wilbekin’s decision to join 
the Gators one year early, next sea-son will likely be a developmental one for him. While the 6-foot-5-inch 
Prather, who didn’t play much as a 
guard in high school, will probably only see time at shooting guard and small forward.This could force Walker and 
Boynton to carry the load once again.
Walker seemed to tire out as 
Southeastern Conference play went on last season. In the first eight SEC games, the 5-foot-8-inch point guard 
averaged 17.8 points and shot at a 46 
percent clip.
But his production decreased 
Lack of depth at guard positions still an issue for UF

UF baseball coachas he put up just 11.4 points per 
game on 27 percent shooting in the final 12 contests of the sea-son.
“(Walker and Boynton) prob-
ably got caught this past year playing way too many minutes,” Donovan said. “We probably would have liked to have pressed 
a little bit more and maybe have done some more things defen-
sively, but it was really difficult because we did rely on both of 
those guys to score.”
After playing at the shooting 
guard position as a freshman, 
Walker was forced to switch to the point guard spot last year after Nick Calathes decided to forgo his final two seasons at UF.
“I really didn’t know what 
to expect,” Donovan said. “That 
transition period, you really don’t 
know how it’s going to go.”
This uncertainty combined 
with the freshman struggles of Boynton led to inconsistent per-formances from the two last sea-son. 
But Donovan hopes those 
struggles will help the two when they are looked upon once again to carry the load in the back-
court.
“I think coming into this year, 
with them having a year under 
their belts and the experience Boynton gained as a freshman and the amount of minutes he played will hopefully help them this year,” Donovan said.18, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 29, 2010

You hear that noise? It’s the sound of 
the dead period for Gators sports. The period between the end of sum-
mer sports and the start of fall ones. 
When Florida State ousted third-seeded 
Florida from the College World Series on June 21, it marked the end of the 2009-10 ath-
letic year for the University of Florida.
The loss also signaled another unsatisfy-
ing finish to an otherwise great season for a 
Gators team this year.
I’m sure you’ve heard the old idiom: al-
ways a bridesmaid, never a bride.
I’ve always thought it was an interesting 
one. I’ve also found it to be an adequate way to describe, for the most part, UF athletics in 
the past year.
With the women’s swimming and diving 
title and the men’s track and field team’s in-
door championship aside, it’s been a close, but no cigar year for UF athletics.
The school’s 17 teams combined for 14 
top-10 finishes nationally – and one team, men’s golf, finished 11th – but only two were able to close out memorable seasons 
with the lifting of a national championship 
trophy.
Of those 14 top-10 finishes, the most no-
table was the football team, which came into the season as the defending BCS champions and spent most of the year atop the polls. That is, until the team was demolished by 
Alabama in the Southeastern Conference 
Championship Game and denied a chance to defend its national title in Pasadena, Ca-lif.
Instead, fans were left with a trip to the 
Sugar Bowl in New Orleans and many were left saying sugar never tasted so bittersweet because the Gators weren’t able to “Finish the Mission.”
Less than a month before the football 
team’s title hopes were crushed, the then-fifth ranked women’s cross country team had its aspirations dashed (no pun intended) 
and it finished seventh at the NCAA Cham-
pionships on the campus of Indiana State.
The women’s volleyball and soccer teams 
met similar fates when both suffered early-round exits in the NCAA Tournament.
The women’s gymnastics team won the 
SEC title and hosted the NCAA Champion-ships in April and had a great chance to take home the program’s first NCAA title. Even 
former Georgia coach Suzanne Yoculan, who 
won 10 titles in Athens, Ga., said she would put her money on the Gators to win it all – that is, if she were a gambling woman. But the team finished fifth at the Super Six after gaffes in 
the lineup of each 
event.
While the wom-
en’s swimming and 
diving team took 
home a champi-onship, the men’s 
team could only muster a fifth-place finish. The same happened with the women’s track 
team, which finished fourth at the indoor 
championships while the men took home the title – and both finished in the top three at the outdoor championships.
Then there was UF’s softball team, which 
entered the Women’s College World Series as the fourth overall seed but was shellacked by UCLA 16-3 in the first game and then eliminated by SEC rival Georgia in Oklaho-
ma City, leaving the WCWS empty-handed 
for a third straight time.
And of course, most recently, there was 
the disappointing CWS exit from the No. 
3 overall seeded baseball team in Omaha, 
Neb., when the team faltered after playing some of its best baseball of the season in re-gionals and super regionals.But there’s something to be said for UF’s 
teams “always being bridesmaids” this year.
Some may view the early postseason ex-
its as underachieving on behalf of the teams, but in reality, people should take a step back and look at the larger picture for UF athlet-
ics.  
To have so many teams vying for nation-
al titles means athletic director Jeremy Foley 
has built one of the nation’s best athletic programs in his 18 years at the helm, and it 
shows. Florida finished second to Stanford 
– which won for the 16th year in a row – in the 2009-10 Learfield Sports Directors’ Cup, which is given annually to the best collegiate 
athletic program.
The finish was Florida’s best since a tie 
for second in 1997-98, and the school’s 17th 
top-seven finish in the award’s 17-year his-tory.
Maybe next year more of the school’s 
teams will live up to their potential and we will all see more brides and fewer brides-maids. One thing is for sure, though: stu-
dents and fans alike shouldn’t take these 
bridesmaids and the sustained success that Foley has brought to UF athletics during his tenure as AD for granted.

NEW YORK – Cincinnati Ben-
gals receiver Chris Henry suffered 
from a chronic brain injury that may have influenced his mental state and 
behavior before he died last winter, 
West Virginia University research-ers said Monday.
The doctors had done a micro-
scopic tissue analysis of Henry’s brain that showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
Neurosurgeon Julian Bailes and 
California medical examiner Ben-
net Omalu, co-directors of the Brain 
Injury Research Institute at WVU, announced their findings alongside Henry’s mother, Carolyn Henry Glaspy, who called it a “big shock” because she knew nothing about her 26-year-old son’s underlying condi-tion.
Henry died in December, a day 
after he came out of the back of a pickup truck his fiancée was driving near their home in Charlotte, N.C. It’s unclear whether Henry jumped or fell. Toxicology tests found no al-cohol in his system, and an autopsy concluded he died of numerous head injuries, including a fractured skull and brain hemorrhaging.
But Bailes, team doctor for the 
Mountaineers and a former Pitts-burgh Steelers physician, said it’s easy to distinguish those acute traumatic injuries from the underly-ing condition he and Omalu found when staining tiny slices of Henry’s brain.
Bailes and fellow researchers be-lieve chronic traumatic encephalop-
athy, or CTE, is caused by multiple 
head impacts, regardless of whether those blows result in a concussion 
diagnosis. A number of studies, in-
cluding one commissioned by the NFL, have found that retired profes-
sional football players may have a 
higher rate than normal of Alzheim-er’s disease and other memory prob-
lems.
What’s interesting, Bailes said, is 
that Henry was only 26, and neither 
NFL nor WVU records show he was diagnosed with a concussion during his playing career.
But it doesn’t take a collision with 
another player for brain trauma to occur.
“The brain floats freely in your 
skull,” Omalu said. “If you’re mov-ing very quickly and suddenly stop, the brain bounces.”
And over time, with repetition, 
that causes big problems.
CTE carries specific neurobehav-
ioral symptoms, Bailes said – typi-cally, failure at personal and busi-
ness relationships, use of drugs and 
alcohol, depression and suicide.
“Chris Henry did not have that 
entire spectrum and we don’t know if there’s a cause and effect here,” Bailes said. 
Glaspy gave Bailes permission to 
examine her son’s brain in detail.
“I was a little scared,” she said. “It 
was something new to me. I’m still trying to educate myself as to what it means. Some of it makes sense with some of the behavioral patterns in Chris -- just like mood swings and the headaches.
“Hopefully I can share whatever 
they share with me with other par-ents and help the NFL deal with the 
matter of being hit in the head and 
concussions and to educate our-selves as mothers and fathers when we send our kids out there on the field.”20, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 29, 2010

receiver suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy before the accident that caused his death.

Taylor places second in triple jump at USA Track and Field Championships
Drake University in Des Moines, 
Iowa. 
Craddock struggled at the 
start, scratching on his first two at-tempts, but his third jump became 
the third-best leap in school his-
tory.
“I sat down and really thought 
about it,” Craddock said of his last jump. “I tried to visualize my whole set: my run-through, my jump off the board, everything. I pretty much just had to think about it and go get it.”
It meant even more to him to 
win a junior championship because he had been unable to compete in the junior championships during his last three years of high school 
due to injuries and a near-death 
experience.
“This is like the Olympics for me,” he said.
Competing in 
the USA Track and Field Cham-pionships, fel-low UF jumper 
Christian Taylor also had a good weekend. The 
NCAA Outdoor 
and Indoor men’s triple jump 
champion placed second in the triple jump and 12th in the long jump. 
All-American sprinter Calvin 
Smith placed sixth overall in the men’s 400-meter dash final, re-cording a time of 45.27. Fellow senior sprinter R.J. Anderson also competed in the 400-meter dash, but he did not advance out of the 
qualifying heats. 
Florida had two of its women’s 
athletes also compete this past weekend. 
Freshman sprinter Lanie Whit-
taker ran in the junior women’s 
400-meter dash, but she placed 20th in the first round with a time of 55.79 and did not advance. 
Ugonna Ndu, a freshman hur-
dler, also competed in the junior championships placing fourth 
overall in the 400-meter hurdles. 
Her time of 59.94 qualified her for the World Junior Championships.
