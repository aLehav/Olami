MIAMI BEACH — Florida prosecutors won’t file charges 
against a cast member of MTV’s “Jersey Shore” who allegedly 
punched another woman at a South Beach nightclub.
Miami-Dade County prosecutors said Wednesday they won’t 
charge Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola. A woman had accused Gi-ancola of punching her in the face May 8. 
Prosecutors said a battery may have occurred, but it’s their 
policy not to file misdemeanor charges against suspects who are no longer in the county. 
Giancola has returned to New York.

Ozzy Angulo lives his life by 
the credo “if at first you don’t suc-
ceed, try, try again.”
The 30-year-old New York na-tive may have lost the election for 
Gainesville mayor in March, but 
that doesn’t mean he’s any less de-
termined to make a difference in this community.
This time around, Angulo is 
running for city commissioner 
of District 3, which encompasses southwest Gainesville. He has only 
one opponent in the race, local bar 
and restau-rant owner Rob Zeller.
A n g u l o 
sees himself as the people’s candi-
date and hopes to usher in a new era of openness and approachabil-
ity in local politics. 
“I see myself as a represen-
tative of the working class in Gainesville,” he said. “I want to in-clude as many people as I can into our structure and system.”
Though he’s never held public office, Angulo is no stranger to the local political landscape. 
He’s currently drafting a piece 
of legislation that, if passed, would allow bars and clubs to stay open until 3 a.m., without altering the Former mayor candidate runs for city commission STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Student Government senators unani-
mously passed a resolution Tuesday night 
calling for the formation of a review board 
to monitor the actions and policies of the University Police Department.
As proposed by the Senate, the board 
would be comprised of students, faculty, alumni and members of the community who take an interest in the actions of UPD.
The resolution was written in response to 
the confrontation between UPD and gradu-ate student Kofi Adu-Brempong in March. 
Members of Adu-Brempong’s family 
were present at the meeting to encourage senators to pass the resolution and thank 
them for their support. 
Adu-Brempong’s niece, Danielle Agye-
mang, read a letter from her uncle in which Adu-Brempong thanked senators for think-
ing of him in writing this legislation.
“Your call for a review board is not only 
right, but long overdue,” Adu-Brempong wrote.
After the resolution passed, supporters 
of Adu-Brempong present during the meet-ing erupted in cheers.
The resolution, which is a formal expres-
sion of the Senate’s opinion, will be sent to 
President Bernie Machen and UPD Chief Linda Stump.
� TUITION INCREASED BY 7 PERCENT.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Santa Fe College had a busy day Tuesday, 
announcing tuition increases and profes-
sor pay raises, and receiving a $1.67 million grant for additions to a science facility.
Beginning in the fall semester, Santa Fe 
will be increasing its tuition by about 7 per-cent. Students taking 15 credits each semes-ter will be charged an additional $171.60 each year.
Although this might not sound like good 
news for Santa Fe students, it could have been worse. The college was authorized by the state legislature to increase tuition by as much as 13.5 percent. 
The increases in tuition will help the col-
lege pay its staff during the 2010-2011 school year. As soon as July, a 5 percent pay increase will be given to all faculty and staff, includ-ing $1,000 raises for full-time employees.
The $1,000 raise will be factored in before 
the 5 percent increase for full-time staff, ac-cording to Lela Elmore, the director of hu-man resources at Santa Fe.
Additionally, the college has been able to 
save money through a two-year hiring freeze of non-essential personnel, she said. 
Despite the freeze, some replacements 
have been made over the course of those two Senators call for 
UPD review board

  Skateboarders can now jump on their 
new boards and hit the half-pipe right af-
ter purchase.
  FreeRide Surf & Skate opened a skate-
boarding store June 7 at 5221 NW 43rd 
St., within walking distance from the 
skate park near Possum Creek Park.
  The store offers items ranging from 
skateboard apparel to complete skate-
boards.
  FreeRide’s original store, located at 
420 NW 13th St., sells both surﬁ  ng and 
skateboarding supplies, but the new 
store will sell only skateboarding items.
  Tom Glikes, a co-owner of the store, 
said he knew there was a need for a 
skateboard-speciﬁ  c shop in Gainesville 
after he noticed an increase in skaters vis-
iting his ﬁ  rst store over the last year.
  Once the skate park near Possum 
Creek Park opened in April, Glikes said the shop decided to “bite the bullet” and open the second store before someone else did.
  “I had no plans to open a second lo-
cation until the park came to be,” Glikes said.
  Manager Peter Harter said the store’s 
goal is to give skaters quick access to supplies.
  Harter said the new location used to 
house a coffee shop with a drive-thru 
window, which he wants to transform into a “skate-thru” window where skat-
ers could roll through and grab a free drink.
  Though shipments are still coming in, 
Harter said he plans to have the shop ful-ly stocked by the time students go back to school in the fall. 
  The store will celebrate Go Skate-
boarding Day on Monday with free pizza and storewide savings.  Skate shop opens by parkLOCAL

  Perry C. McGriff Jr., a former mayor-
commissioner of Gainesville and state 
representative, announced on Tuesday 
afternoon his campaign to run for Flor-ida Senate District 14.
  The 72-year-old Democrat will be 
challenging Steve Oelrich, the current 
Republican state senator for District 14, 
who is up for reelection in November.
  “Making the decision to run wasn’t 
easy,” McGriff told a crowd of about 60 people in front of his alma mater, 
Gainesville High School.
  He cited his devotion to the city of 
Gainesville and his disappointment with 
the current Legislature’s failed policies 
toward the economy, education and the 
environment as reasons for his cam-
paign.
  “Floridians are fed up,” McGriff said. 
“What I bring is a common-sense ap-proach to the problems facing our state.”
  In his speech, McGriff criticized Oel-
rich’s support of Senate Bill 6, which would have tied teacher pay directly to student performance. He also criticized the incumbent’s support of offshore 
drilling.
  “It should not take a disaster to force 
good judgment,” he said, referring to the 
state’s response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
  If elected, McGriff said he will fo-
cus on how the oil spill will inﬂ  uence the state’s $56-billion tourism industry, 
which is crucial be-cause it provides a tax base that funds educa-tion, he said.
  McGriff, who is a 
board member for the 
Cade Museum for In-novation and Inven-tion, also said state 
leaders need to focus on revenue growth to make Florida the new hub of innova-tion in high-tech achievement.
  “Every dollar we spend in the class-
room is an investment in a job market based on creativity and ingenuity,” he said.  State Senate race set

AroundGainesvillethe dirty life4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 17, 2010
squatters open up about traveling 
and living on the streets the dirty life
   Dirt came to Gainesville to meet 
up with a friend. When he went to his 
friend’s house, he found out the friend was arrested for murder. It wasn’t the first time.
  Janell Pagliara usually stays in Florida. 
She’s only 18, and the farthest she’s trav-eled is Tennessee. She feels at home in Gainesville, even when she doesn’t have a house.
  She came to Gainesville with Ryan 
Haley. This is his first time traveling.
  They chose homelessness.
� � �   
  They usually call themselves “dirty 
kids,” but also go by “rainbows,” “gutter punks,” “crusties” or “squatters.” 
  They travel from town to town—by 
hitchhiking, train hopping or by Craig-slist’s rideshare.
  They rarely settle down.
  Their goal: freedom from mainstream 
culture.
  During a survey by Alachua County 
Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry 
on Jan. 26 and 27, Alachua County had about 1,300 homeless people. It’s not known how many of those are squatters or choose the homeless life.
  Squatters are less likely to use public 
services, said Max Wells, grant manager for the coalition. This also means they are unlikely to show up in homeless shelters, he said.
  According to Gainesville Police Sgt. 
Chuck Reddick, differentiating between trespassers and squatters is difficult. Tres-passers are invited onto property but stay after they’ve been asked to leave, he said. 
Squatters enter abandoned buildings 
without permission.
� � �   
With nearly dreaded hair from not 
showering, do-it-yourself tattoos and piercings covering his face, Dirt is a typi-cal squatter.
  “Travelin’ full of love. Out of luck. 
Anything helps,” he said.
  The 28-year-old, who has been travel-
ing and squatting for about 14 years, holds his damaged piece of cardboard, hoping someone will give him some money.
  If he has money, he uses it to buy al-
cohol and food.
  Getting drunk is Dirt’s ritual, his 
prayer. He does it in every town he visits.
� � �     Pagliara loves Harry Potter and 
SpongeBob.
  She had problems with her parents.  She sounds like any other 18-year-old. 
But she’s not like most other 18-year-olds 
because she’s been homeless since she 
was 12.
  “Most people think owning a house, 
having a wife and kids, living by society and having money is what life is all about. That is bullshit. It’s bullshit,” she said.
  Her mom kicked her out of the house 
multiple times since she was 12, so she would sleep on friends’ couches or at 
Westside Park on the corner of North-
west 34th Street and Eighth Avenue. Soon she was sleeping on couches at ran-dom people’s houses or apartments.
  After a while, she had run out of 
friends to stay with, so she started using a website that lists couches available to sleep on.
  “Couchsurfing.com is a gift from 
whatever  f---ing higher power you want to believe in,” she said.
  Eventually, she started traveling.  “I chose the traveling lifestyle because 
it makes me happy.”
  Mostly, she loves that she can be open 
with other travelers.
  “It makes me happy that I can go, 
‘Oh, you know, I like smoking pot,’ and I 
can smoke pot with someone.”
  She said she doesn’t care that people 
think it’s wrong for her to walk down a 
street asking everyone for money. 
  “I judge me. No one else judges me.”  Pagliara met Haley in Tennessee, and 
she convinced him to travel with her to Gainesville.
  Although he’d read Jack Kerouac and 
dreamed of traveling, he never realized people could do that.
  “When I graduated high school, that’s 
when I realized I don’t want to be here [in Tennessee] anymore,” Haley said. “But I got sucked in, not because college is a bad thing, but I got sucked into college.”
  The traveling lifestyle has taught Ha-
ley that you can travel without money.
� � �   
  Dirt squats because he loves the free-
dom of not having to stay in one place, trapped in a job and a house.
  His favorite part of squatting is get-
ting drunk and fighting other squatters just for fun.
  He gets around by hitchhiking or hop-
ping trains; he doesn’t have a preference.
  He came to Gainesville alone.   He normally travels with a partner, 
known as a road dog, but they split up in Jacksonville. His road dog went to Chi-cago, while Dirt made some money work-
ing for his dad.
  Although Dirt chose homelessness, 
he has a fatalistic sense that he couldn’t 
leave even if he wanted to.
  “It’s not like I have a choice. I ain’t got 
no home down in Fort Myers no more, so I just hit the road, travel around, make money, hang out with new kids and get drunk.”
  When Dirt has no money, he asks 
people for their leftovers, or he gets food out of Dumpsters.
  “Krispy Kreme’s pretty much the rea-
son why I don’t like doughnuts anymore because it’s f---ing gross. That’s all there is to f---ing get out of that f---ing Dumpster is f---ing doughnuts. There’s McDonald’s Dumpster, but McDonald’s food makes 
me sick.”
  Sometimes, he goes to grocery stores 
like Publix.
  “It all depends on if they have a drag-
on. Dragons are compactor Dumpsters; 
there’s a way to get into them, but I don’t know how to do it. Pretty much, just break it.”
  When he’s not searching for food, 
Dirt tries to make money however he can.
  “I’ll make art, play music, panhan-
dle, all kinds of s---. Play music on the 
streets.”
  His biggest moneymaker is selling 
cloth patches to other travelers, so they 
can sew them onto their packs or pants.
  He’ll find someone who has Internet 
and a printer to print off stencils for the patches.
  He made his most recent batch while 
staying at a friend’s house in Orlando. 
His friend’s printer wasn’t working, so he 
made the stencils by tracing them off the computer screen.
  The patches have slogans, philoso-
phies and icons on them.
  “Booze not bombs,” one reads.  “Eat the rich,” says another one, 
alongside McDonald’s golden arches.
  There are Johnny Cash patches, Betty 
Boop patches and a number of patches featuring Calvin, from the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes.
  “I got a s--- ton of them. I sell them 
from anywhere from $2 to $10 depend-ing on who I’m selling them to.”
  Dirt used his most recent profits to 
buy beer.
  Gainesville’s not the best place for 
making money for Dirt. He remembers going to Knoxville, Tenn.
  He held a sign there, just like in 
Gainesville, and he once got $400 in two days. He didn’t squat; he bought hotel rooms.
� � �   
  According to both Dirt and Pagliara, 
the worst thing about Gainesville, which was ranked the fifth meanest city in America last year by the National Coali-tion for the Homeless, are the laws and the police.
  Dirt said another traveler with him 
was accused of raping a girl when they were in San Antonio. The accused 
rapist was later murdered. Although Dirt said he had nothing to do with the mur-der, he left the town because of his fear of cops.
  Similarly, Pagliara hates authority.
  “I think the s---ty thing about Florida 
is it’s got all these rules against travelers,” 
she said. “But it’s also got some of the best places to travel to.”
  According to Pagliara, the police “put 
us crust kids in jail to better society.”
  Dirt wants to settle all the warrants 
the police have for him, but he doesn’t care if the police catch him or not.
  “I’ve been thinking about doing a jail 
tour one of these summers, just going around to all the different places that I got warrants,” he said. “But I been talking about it for years, still haven’t done it. . . . If they catch me, they catch me.”
  Pagliara feels the same way; she said 
she doesn’t care because she just ignores the authority. She calls the police sirens a 
“disco dance party.”
  But Gainesville’s still her favorite 
place to be.
  “People in Gainesville actually give a 
s--- about the traveling lifestyle,” she said.
  Pagliara said Gainesville has an end-
less supply of food and people who want 
to help.
  “Almost every person who is in this 
sort of scene, they want to help you if you want to help them,” she said. “That’s ba-sic. It doesn’t matter if you’re a punk or a crust or a rainbow or whatever.”
  Although Dirt does not describe him-
self as a bastion of virtue, he nevertheless won’t pull scams on people to earn his money. He believes in karma.
  “I don’t do that bullshit because I 
believe in karma,” he said. “Karma will f--- you up eventually.”

current alcohol cut-off time. 
The intention is to cut back on 
the hectic congestion that follows 
when bar owners are forced to kick people out all at once, which inter-feres with police officers’ abilities 
to respond to calls in a timely fash-
ion, he said.
Angulo said it would also help 
generate revenue for venue owners, who sometimes kick out patrons 30 
or 40 minutes before 2 a.m., just to 
ensure everyone is out in time.
Angulo is still in the early stages 
of drafting, working with citizens, 
Gainesville police and the city 
commission.
“So far we’ve had a very posi-
tive response,” he said. “Our goal 
is to make sure we have something 
that’ll be approved. We’re tak-
ing every possible step to make 
sure everyone’s concerns are ad-
dressed.”Angulo said, if elected, he’ll en-
courage people to voice their opin-
ions on issues like maintaining neighborhood safety or increas-ing economic development in east 
Gainesville.
“I plan on being a very hands-
on elected official,” he said. “If any-thing is affecting the city, I’ll have a 
hand in correcting it.”
Angulo spends 
much of his day at 
The Laboratory, 
818 W University 
Ave., his de facto campaign head-quarters. He can also be reached 
through his cam-
paign website,

GOVT , from page 1Bill aims to rebuild trust with UPD
SFC didn’t raise tuition by maximumProgress Party Sen. Jose Soto, a co-author 
of the bill, said it is now up to UPD and uni-
versity administration to determine their vi-
sion for the review board. 
“This is arguably the best tool to repair the 
damaged trust,” Soto said.
Jonathan Ossip, Senate leader for the Stu-
dent Alliance party, said his party appreciates the formation of the board and encouraged senators to follow through with the idea.
“I just want to remind everybody with a 
lack of resolution in your actions, your words mean nothing,” Ossip said.
Unite Party Sen. Ben Meyers, who co-au-
thored the bill, said the legislation is bipar-tisan and intended to create a venue for stu-
dents to rebuild their trust in UPD.
“This bill is not taking a side in the incident 
but it is taking a side to mend the wounds 
made from it,” Meyers said.
years. “Critical need” positions, such as police 
officers and certain professors, have been add-
ed when necessary, she said.
“The employees have banded together and 
we’ve done the same thing and more with less 
people,” she said. “It’s been able to save us 
money and keep us operating within the funds 
that were available.”
Santa Fe also received a $1.67 million grant to build a biotechnology laboratory that will be 
added to the Perry Center for Emerging Tech-nologies in Alachua.
According to a press release, the project is 
expected to create 270 new jobs.
In addition to the biotechnol-

The recent Gulf oil spill has become more than a trag-
edy, and the Obama administration has more than botched the response. This crisis illuminates the ad-
ministration’s lack of leadership. Unfortunately for Ameri-cans, we see a president too tangled in a web of bureaucracy, 
ego and inexperience to appropriately handle the situation. It 
was well-worded in a recent column by Mark Steyn: “He has grand plans for ‘the environment’ - all of it, wherever it may be. Why should the great eco-Gulliver be ensnared by some Lilliputian oil spill lapping ‘round his boots?”
According to documents released by the Center for Public 
Integrity, the Obama administration was warned within 24 hours of the initial eruption that could release more than  8,000 barrels a day into the Gulf from then on. Obama responded by 
spending the next two months at fundraisers, commencement 
speeches, parties, golf tournaments and even football games on the White House lawn. He was too busy to go to Louisiana.  
On the other hand, nine days after the initial explosion, Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency and requested permission from the federal government to construct mas-sive sand berms to block the oil flow. A month later, Obama allowed for 2 percent of the berms to be constructed.
A disaster such as this is not a partisan matter – both sides 
of the aisle recognize its significance. I bring up Jindal not to compare a Republican’s action to a Democrat’s, but rather to expose Obama for the inexperienced “chief executive of good intentions” as Bill Clinton so aptly named him.
While Obama was tripping over his own ego on the mat-
ter, he delivered a speech in Pittsburgh that was tinged with a post-Watergate Nixonian aroma. He was quick to blame the free market and capitalism for the problem instead of pleading for partisan politics to be laid aside in favor of a 
solution. Obama exposed his true colors. His main goal in 
the oil spill reaction is not to plug it up but to move the blame from his camp to anything else it may stick to. 
Then, Obama took a decidedly partisan approach at de-
vising a plan. Federal agencies were unleashed to respond without sufficient coordination and direction. They ended up producing the slow response and inaction we see today. Solutions offered by the private sector were tossed aside for a govern-
ment response. Skimmer boats from 
around the world await the opportu-nity to help the cleanup, but Obama is refusing to waive the Jones Act that would let them operate here for fear of 
upsetting his union supporters. Perhaps a lesson here is that government alone is not the solution to ecological problems. The modern ecological movement began in the Capitalist West. The first Earth Day didn’t occur in Moscow, Havana 
or even Sweden. It began in the U.S.
As Obama grasps at straws, more people begin to see he 
may not have the magic touch we were led to believe. On the 
“Today Show,” we saw Obama squirm and flounder. After Matt Lauer led him hook, line and sinker into being disgrun-tled over the spill, Obama called for “ass to be kicked.” Lauer asked Obama if he had even met with the BP CEO. He had to admit that he hadn’t. The reason for criticizing the Obama administration for its poor reaction to the spill is simple: It 
promised more than it was capable of delivering during the 
campaign, and now it won’t admit when it needs help.
Government has to establish requirements for safe and 
ethical operation to look out for the citizen’s interest. But when private enterprise solutions to a problem become de-monized for a political agenda, we see the limits of a leftist ideology with blinders on. In the case of foreign skimming boats or Jindal’s sand berms, it is the Obama administration that is hindering solutions. What we are seeing in the Gulf 
is the hollowness of the claim that the federal government 
is the solution to every problem. The hope and change of a government cure-all has run smack into the wall of reality. 
Bryan Griffin is a first-year law student. Lowering the bar
It has been a few months 
since he came in last place in Gainesville’s mayoral 
election, but Ozzy Angulo is ready to give politics another try in the upcoming race for City Commission District 3.
While he has never held 
public office, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps, worked as bartender and has been a manager at Taco 
Bell. Lack of political experi-
ence has never been a prob-lem for us when it comes to local office. You have to start 
somewhere, right? That said, 
we still do not know what to think about this guy.
His political platform is 
rather simple – he wants to 
end the meal limits at home-
less shelters, reverse the ris-ing crime rate and tackle transportation problems in 
the city. We have no qualms with any of that. In fact he 
sounds like a dream candi-date, but we have to wonder 
about a guy who lists his 
campaign headquarters as the Laboratory, a bar on Uni-versity Avenue.
Maybe he is trying to at-
tract the student vote by showing he still knows how to party, or maybe he got a special rate for booking the 
bar as a headquarters and 
venue for his election night party. Whatever the reason, it is a little weird.
We like rooting for the 
underdog, especially when they have had such dismal defeats as Angulo had in the mayoral election, but some-
thing seems a little bit off 
about this candidate. If noth-ing else, we are a little bit intrigued about his choice of 
headquarters.Success Snub
Football shouldn’t get all 
the glory
It is no secret that UF has a tradition of excellence on the foot-
ball field, but we were shocked when we heard the Univer-sity Athletic Association voted to spend $550,000 on statues 
of our three Heisman Trophy winners, Steve Spurrier, Danny Wuerffel and Tim Tebow.
Currently there is only one bronze statue on UF campus – Al-
bert A. Murphree, the second president of the university. Since the new statues of our Heisman winners will be paid for with private donations, we will not say we are opposed to the ven-ture, but we cannot help but feel like there are more qualified candidates to receive the honor of a larger-than-life likeness.
Many remarkable people have graduated from UF: six as-
tronauts, nine United States senators, countless CEOs and two Nobel Prize winners – Marshall Warren Nirenberg, who won 
in 1968 for physiology/medicine, and Robert Howard Grubbs, 
who won in 2005 for chemistry. We just do not understand why our football players need to be honored in such a lavish manner while some of UF’s most distinguished graduates are relegated to small plaques and portraits hanging on walls somewhere off the beaten path.
We would be lying if we said that Spurrier, Wuerffel and 
Tebow were not inspirational figures. Wuerffel and Tebow have proven to be especially good examples for young Gators 
fans by advocating higher education and avoiding drugs, but 
their careers are not plausible for 99 percent of the Student Body. Achieving greatness in your chosen career, however, is something everyone can aspire to.
Athletics is a means for increasing the public awareness of 
a university’s academics. As an institution of higher education, UF needs to realize that even though the Heisman Trophy is a prestigious award, it does not reflect on the university’s academ-ic quality. Our dominance on the field is the perfect opportunity 
to show the world our accomplishments in the classroom.

‘Good Life’ course serves a pur -
pose for freshmen.
The Editorial Board misunderstood 
the purpose of the course, ‘The Good 
Life.’ The course would challenge stu-dents’ views about what ‘the good life’ is and to think about whether it exists. 
The class doesn’t just “give incom-
ing freshmen a chance to bond over coursework” but has the noble goal of making students reflect on their com-monly held notions.
The class would cover topics like 
happiness, meaning in life, death, eth-ics and politics, examined from ancient and modern perspectives. A required 
philosophy course for liberal arts and 
science students is long overdue. It’s a travesty that many math and science courses are required, but few of the humanities are. Too many students take few courses beyond the minimum requirements. Studying philosophy, sociology and even ‘the good life’ are important steps to becoming a better 
educated citizen and person.

�     �  �Cutting post-doctoral health care 
benefits will hurt research.
We are writing as current postdoc-

believe this represents a step backward 
in UF’s mission to become a top-tier research institution. Cutting postdoc-toral benefits will make UF much less competitive in attracting the best and brightest researchers. Postdoctoral as-sociates are the driving force behind all aspects of research, including research training for undergraduates and grad-

Students in Buenos Aires, Argentina, spend, on average, 
nearly a fourth of their annual income on tuition.
A desire for a good education and a respect for cus-
toms, family and  national pride outweigh the negative  aspects 
of severe inflation and low average income on many univer-
sity students in Argentina.
Three students majoring in psychology at the Universidad 
del Salvador in the Recoleta barrio in Buenos Aires, Paula Ko-
losuarg, 30, Karina Pizarro, 31, and Martina Hartubout, 18, said 
their decisions to go to  college were based on a multitude  of 
things including opinions of family members and family in-
come.
But when it came down to it, Hartubout, a Buenos Aires 
resident, or  porteña, said the reason she is there  is because she 
liked staying close to home.
“We prefer to stay in Buenos Aires; our family and friends 
are here,” the first-year student said.
Although an annual tuition of 7,200 Argentine pesos (about 
USD  $1,800) may sound like a bargain to  many Americans, the 
cost of higher education is steep for the average Argentine.
According to the U.S. Embassy  in Argentina, the average 
annual  income for Argentine residents in  2008 was USD $8,219. 
Therefore, the cost of tuition alone at the Universidad del Salva-
dor is about 22 percent of an average citizen’s yearly income.Besides the cost, another influ-
ential factor in the students’ deci-
sion whether to pursue a college de-
gree was their personal feelings and 
desire  for an education. 
As in the U.S.,  they had the liberty 
to choose to  continue their studies at a 
college  or begin their careers. 
But a college education in Argen-
tina is not as imperative to success in 
the workplace  as it is in the United 
States.
Job availability without a degree is  not a major issue, and 
income is not as highly affected by education levels as in the 
U.S.
Even though a college degree isn’t required, Argentines do 
value education and boast a literacy rate of 98 percent, accord-
ing to a 2008 UNICEF report. The country has over  20 national 
universities in addition to many state and private schools.
Hartubout said the Universidad del Salvador was the first 
school to implement a psychology program in Argentina. The 
program is also  one of the most preferred majors  within the 
university.
Students are subject to a more structured yet nonspecific schedule.
Unlike in the United States,  students don’t have a choice 
of what classes they take or what time they begin.
“It is all different,” Hartubout said. “I arrive at 8 but it 
ends  differently (each day). On Wednesday  we ended at 11, 
but today we ended at 1.”
Rather than having a set time for the classes to end, there is 
only a specified beginning. It is up to the professor to decide 
when each class ends.
After class each day, Hartubout waits for a family friend to 
pick her up and drive her 40 minutes to  her home. Hartubout 
has to commute each day since there is no student housing or 
commuter parking available on the campus located on Aveni-
da Marcelo T. de Alvear, a busy street in a crowded city.
But despite the challenges in an  Argentine economy that 
finds many  families struggling to survive, Hartubout  and the 
other women have still found a way to earn a degree in an at-
mosphere many North American university students are not 
required  to face. 
These women said they are determined to advance in their 
chosen profession so they can help others in their community.

This week, Avenue writer Alex 
Orlando interviewed afro-
beat band 3rd Stone.
He said seeing the band live 
was a chance to witness the 
strong connection between the 
band and its fans that he’d 
heard so much about.
“It’s crazy how ambitious 
these guys are. They’re really 
trying to hold the community 
together with their music. 
Wester preaches about unity 
in his songs and with his stage 
banter. At the show, I couldn’t 
help but be swept up by the 
energy and emotion coming 
through the speakers. You can 
tell the band wants to spread 
a positive message and stay 
true to themselves and their 
unique sound.”
3rd Stone will be performing 
again in Gainesville on July

UF comedy team wins title
By ALI RIECK
avenue writer 
Gators have a new reason to turn their 
jorts-swag on: UF students Rudy Mendoza, Calvin Cole, Tim Keck and Brian Amos won the title of Funniest Comedy Team at the Na-tional College Comedy Competition.
Rooftop Comedy, a broadcasting network 
that films up-and-coming comedians, hosted the annual competition that pitted 32 colleg-es against each other.
The contest began in February and culmi-
nated in an all-expenses-paid trip to Aspen, Colorado, for the four final teams.
Each member of the team performed a 
four-minute set at the Aspen Rooftop Comedy Festival. A live audience and online viewers voted for the Funniest Comedy Team.
To celebrate its win, the team members 
took a gondola to the top of Aspen Mountain and photographed their new trophies against the Colorado snow.
“Right after we got our trophies, we rode 
up to the top of the mountain, threw snow -
balls at each other and made snow angels and stuff,” said Cole of the team’s post-win 
experience.
The festival hosted comedians like Michael 
Ian Black (Comedy Central’s “Michael and Mi -
chael Have Issues”), Oscar Nuñez (NBC’s “The 
Office”), and Danny Pudi (Abed from NBC’s “Community”).
Last year, UF’s comedy team made it to the 
NCCC competion’s semifinals.
“It was cool to go back and get, not exactly 
redemption, but to prove that we had gotten better and deserved to be back,” Cole said.
Stuck on layover from Denver to Gainesville, 
the team sounded tired but excited.
“We got a lot of support from Theatre Strike 
Force, ArACkA, friends, family and UF fans in general who watched and voted,” Cole said.
Cole earned the additional title of “MVP” 
along with the chance to be named the Fun-niest Student in America. He will head to Chi-cago on Friday to perform at Just for Laughs, a comedy festival presented by TBS. His set will be on tbs.com and open for online voting from June 22 to 28.

Pool party brings despair
By RICHARD STEHLI
avenue writer
Summer pool parties include beer, 
food, music, and girls in bikinis. What more 
could you ask for? Saturday seemed to be 
my lucky day, as Gainesville Place hosted 
its Summer A pool party. 
I should have known that my days of 
partying were over when I found myself lathering up in SPF-45 sunscreen 20 min-utes before leaving my apartment. I should have recognized my absolute refusal to get a tan — something that comprises an en-tire third of some people’s daily routines 
— as a sign. 
After a few minutes aimlessly walk -
ing around the pool deck, I decided that 
I should probably get drunk. I hesitate to call any party that necessitates drinking a good party, but I figured that once I had a few beers I might be willing to make an exception.
I pride myself on knowing a lot about 
beer, but on a hot day sitting by a pool, I’ll drink anything cold and refreshing. I went straight for the keg.
My first two big cups of foam, however, 
left a lot to be desired. I made a few rounds of the party looking for the beer keg, but apparently there was a mix-up at the ware -
house and we received several kegs of foam by mistake.
Since cold beer wasn’t going to be a 
part of the picture, I jumped in the pool to cool off. North central Florida, cruel mis-
tress that she is, had the last laugh. The 
pool was no colder than the air I was trying to escape. I decided to head home.
It isn’t that I don’t like the components 
of pool parties—far from it. It’s just that so many things that seem great in a single place and time do not add up to the sum of all the parts. If I could go back in time to my years as an underclassman, I’m sure I 
would love to broil my skin to a deep crim-
son among the coeds with a plastic cup of foam in my hand. I used to hunger for the opportunity to guzzle a cheap beer in the sunshine. I wish I could take myself back in time because pool parties seem like ex-actly what I used to be—a lot of fun.THURSDAY, JUNE 17, 2010  � ALLIGATOR, 9
aveToonJam band connects with fans
  By ALEX ORLANDO
 avenue writer
 
  Music echoed out of the Bo Diddley Com-
munity Plaza on Friday, bouncing off the court-
house walls and sending a booming bass line through downtown Gainesville.
  About 150 people swayed in the heavy 
summer air, vibrating with the chik-a chik-a 
upbeat of Wester Joseph’s guitar, and children 
did their own little jigs in the grass.
  Joseph, frontman for Gainesville’s jam 
band 3rd Stone, looked out over the crowd as he remembered why his fans were there: to hear the music they had read about on Face-book.
  Joseph, who posts between ﬁ  ve and 10 
status updates a week about his band, said 
the social networking website has served as 
an extension of the talk that circulates in the Gainesville music scene.
  He said that fans talking about the band, 
“liking” the band on Facebook and shooting videos at shows helped to gather the crowd on Friday.
  “It’s like a big tree,” he said of the band’s 
fanbase. “It’s very ﬂ  attering, you know? Very 
cool.”
    But Joseph said it wasn’t only Facebook 
that has helped the band’s city-wide recogni-tion.
  Although its been about ﬁ  ve years since 
Gainesville turned its last band, Against Me!, 
to the world stage, he said, the town is still nurturing to musicians because it offers three things: cheap rent, hundreds of fellow musi-cians and make-your-own venues at house parties.
  Unlike other Gainesville jam bands, Joseph 
said 3rd Stone is more ambitious. The mem-
bers play for themselves rather than the jam 
genre, he said, which leads to sets of ambigu-ous songs without much practice.
  “I don’t see a sense of urgency in the jam 
scene,” he said. “When we play, we’re trying to burn something to the ground. We just jam that shit and make a song right there.”
  3rd Stone sets itself apart by staying true 
to its message of unity and using its connec-
tions to branch out of Gainesville, he said.
    Joseph said he thinks bands are headed 
in a more cultural direction, noting the fame 
of Umoja Orchestra, an afro-pop band from Gainesville.
  He said those bands naturally attract peo-
ple from their own culture and gather more fans through Facebook. 
  Aside from local and online networking, Jo-
seph’s advice to bands who want to become better known is this: “If you do something amazing, people are going to talk about it.”

“Futurama” returns to Comedy Central  
By DREW WILSON
alligator staff writer
It has been nearly seven years 
since the final episode aired, but 
“Futurama” is back and better than ever.
Beginning June 24 with two new 
episodes, the Groening show will 
end its hiatus and move to Comedy 
Central for a fifth season – or sixth, depending on how you look at it.
Having seen the first episodes of 
the new season, I can say the hu -
morous duo of Matt Groening and David X. Cohen is as sharp as ever, and the animation is crisper and cleaner than it was on Fox.
The new season seamlessly 
picks up right where “Into the Wild Green Yonder” left off, and it does not take long for the writers to hu -
morously explain away that movie’s ending through the professor’s hi-
larious brand of pseudoscience.
The writing and pacing of the 
new episodes is just as stellar as 
the best of the show’s old run. It’s quick and punchy, but it still finds time to throw in all the nerdy word-play and Fry moments that made me love the show in the first place. By the time the two episodes I had the 
privilege of watching came to an end, I almost put the disc into my season-three box set.
The original voice cast is back 
as well, and, thanks to all those straight-to-DVD movies they made in that seven-year stretch, they are spot on. Hearing Billy West voice a 
conversation among Phillip J. Fry, 
Zapp Brannigan and the Profes-sor without missing a beat made it seem like the show never left.The road to renewal was not easy 
though.
Since the show was canceled in 
2003, it has lived on through four straight-to-DVD movies and syndica-tion on Comedy Central and Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim. By the time strong DVD sales and decent rat-ings in syndication caught Comedy Central’s attention, it was difficult to 
get all the voice talent to commit to 
a comeback. At one point, Fox an-nounced it was going to replace the entire cast.
Thankfully, that never happened. 
The final product is pretty much the same “Futurama” that was unjustly canceled in 2003, and given the op-portunity I would not change a thing 
about it.
Be sure to catch the new epi -
sodes when they start on Comedy 
Central June 24 at 10 p.m.

Below a flock of butterflies and a few 
feet from a mammoth skeleton hang 15 
windows into Florida’s Nature Coast.
If you don’t stop and take a look, you 
may miss it. Rumor has it these windows 
will soon be obscured by oil and develop-
ment.
The images photographer Eric Zamo -
ra has captured of the Nature Coast are on display at the Florida Museum of Natural History. The gallery, “Life on the Edge: The Story of Florida’s Nature Coast,” is on display until Aug. 8.
“I was born and raised in Florida,” 
Zamora said. “Working and helping to protect Florida is very close to my heart.”
Zamora delineates the Nature Coast 
as the area from St. Marks National Wild-
life Refuge near Tallahassee to northern 
Pasco County. This 240-mile stretch of coastline, aside from a few small com-
munities, is essentially undeveloped.
He said he wants to make a differ -
ence by promoting conservation and 
sustainable development through his photography but stressed that he is not 
anti-development.
“Conservation is a part of develop-
ment, it doesn’t necessarily have to be 
associated with building,” he said. “If you create a new National Wildlife Ref-uge you’re developing and expanding.”
In an effort to document the pristine 
Nature Coast, Zamora paddled the 105-mile Big Bend Paddling Trail, located 
on the western coast of north central 
Florida, in nine days. He plans to finish paddling the 240-mile stretch of the Na-ture Coast but is waiting to raise more funding.
Zamora has been working on the 
project for two years. After a four-month stint at the Florida Museum of Natural History, the exhibit is moving to Sara-
sota.
The 15 photographs on display at the 
museum capture the cultural heritage, 
landscapes and wildlife of the Nature Coast.
“That’s really my purpose with my 
conservation photography,” Zamora said. “It’s to give a face to an issue.”
Zamora said he hasn’t been back 
to the Nature Coast since early March when he was on the Withlacoochee River. Although his conservation project 
will eventually end, he said it will always 
have value.
Prints from Zamora’s “Life on the 
Edge” gallery and others can be pur -
chased online at ericzamora.com. De -
tails about price and size can be found on the website.THURSDAY, JUNE 17, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 11

Utah is expected to announce a move to the Pac-10 in a news conference Thursday. It has been 
a part of the Mountain West since the conference was created in 1999.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
SALT LAKE CITY — Utah is poised 
to become the 12th member of the Pac-
10 as the conference quickly pivoted Wednesday to invite the Utes after being 
turned down by Texas and four other 
members of the Big 12 on Monday.
Utah officials did not immediately 
say whether the invitation would be ac-cepted, but it would be shocking if the Utes didn’t leave the Mountain West Conference for the Pac-10.
Spokeswoman Liz Abel said the ath-
letics department would not comment 
until Thursday, after the school’s board 
of trustees meets to discuss the school’s conference affiliation. A news confer-ence was scheduled at the football sta-dium following the meeting.
Pac-10 officials are expected to attend 
Thursday’s news conference in Utah.
Utah has been a member of the MWC 
since the league began in 1999 — and 
one of its most successful in football and 
basketball.
There had been speculation on Tues-
day that Utah would be the next school to be approached by the Pac-10. When asked about the possibility, school presi-dent Michael Young told The Associated Press “we wouldn’t anticipate making a move of this magnitude without the 
concurrence of our board of trustees.”
If Utah bolts the Mountain West, it 
would be the latest in a string of confer-
ence affiliation changes.
Last week, Colorado decided to leave 
the Big 12 and accept an invitation to join the Pac-10. Nebraska has also said it will leave the Big 12 for the Big Ten, while Boise State is fleeing the Western Athletic Conference to join the Moun-tain West.
Earlier in the week, Texas, Oklahoma, 
Texas A&M, Texas Tech and Oklahoma State recommitted to the Big 12 instead of hopping to the Pac-10.
That left the Pac-10 in need of another 
member to reach the 12 required to hold a football championship game.
The other members of the Pac-10 are 
USC, UCLA, Stanford, California, Wash-ington, Washington State, Arizona, Ari-zona State, Oregon and Oregon State. Utah had already previously scheduled games with Oregon in 2011, and Wash-ington State and Colorado in 2012 and 
2013.
Utah officials have long been frus-
trated about their inability to play for a 
football national cham-
pionship while in the 
Mountain West. Utah 
had an undefeated sea-son in 2008 but was not 
invited to the national title game. It de-feated Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. Utah also went undefeated in 2004 and did not play for the national championship.
Under the Bowl Championship Se-
ries, the champions of six conferences have automatic bids to play in top-tier bowl games, while the other conferences such as the Mountain West don’t.
Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtl-
eff, angered that the Utes were denied an opportunity to play for a national title, has said he’s investigating the BCS 
for possible antitrust violations.
“We’re convinced the system as set 
up is anticompetitive,” he said. “It goes 
way beyond the University of Utah.”Utah likely to accept invite to Pac-10 Conference

TEEING OFF WITH TOM GREENWe are now at 28 and counting.
The DUI arrest of Gators red-
shirt sophomore wide receiver 
Frankie Hammond Jr. early Sunday morn-
ing was just another in a long line under 
coach Urban Meyer.
Hammond, who was stopped after go-
ing 45 miles per hour down Gale Lemerand 
Drive, is at least the 28th Florida football player to be arrested in Meyer’s five-year tenure  — an average of 5.6 players per sea-son. 
This is 28 more than there should be. While Hammond’s DUI arrest is a seri-
ous matter, that isn’t what bothers me. It’s the fact that the number keeps growing with basically no punishment.
After the latest arrest, there are reports that Meyer is now going to start making everybody accountable for each other’s ac-tions. My question is, where was this three, four or even five seasons ago?
It is remarkable that it took this long for 
this action to come about.
As expected, most students at UF ignore 
the alarming arrest rate.
Truth is that all of this affects them, too. The University of Florida is a fine school, 
but people outside the panhandle state don’t look at that. They associate UF with the foot-ball team, because that’s what’s in the na-tional spotlight.
More than five arrests per year is not 
what students want graduate admission of-ficers, out-of state parents and corporate ex-ecutives to see. Look at another one 
of the in-state schools, the University of Mi-ami. The football team was known for its thug 
persona in the 1980s 
and 1990s. 
Now the private 
school that costs over $30,000 a year and is ranked as 50th among 
national universities by the “U.S. News & World Report” is paying for it. The first thing that pops into mind when thinking 
about UM is arrests, a fight full of helmet 
swinging and the documentary concerning “Thug U.”
Harsher punishment from the coaches is needed. For example, after Aaron Hernan-dez decided to leave the Gators for the NFL Draft, reports leaked of multiple failed drug tests during his playing days at Florida. 
However, he was never suspended for 
this. Instead, he sat out the 2008 season opener against Hawaii and last year’s FIU game because he “wasn’t ready to play.” The real reason needs to be released so play-ers are forced to be held accountable. 
While Hernandez was not arrested, this 
is still an example of Meyer mishandling things.
If this concerning trend continues at UF, 
it can be on the same path as its rival.
This is why Meyer needs to do something 
about this now. For the sake of the football program and, more importantly, the school.

When Kevin O’Sullivan first 
arrived at Florida, the players 
weren’t too pleased with him.
As soon as he took the head 
coaching job in 2007, O’Sullivan 
wasted no time and put in a 7 a.m. 
conditioning workout, something 
the Gators weren’t used to.
“He made sure to tell our 
strength coach to push us to our 
limits,” UF closer Kevin Chapman 
said. “It wasn’t very pretty. Any-
time somebody does that to you it’s a love-hate relationship.”
Whether it was with agility 
drills, long-distance sprints or a 
shuttle run players refer to as 
“ladders,” O’Sullivan made his presence known.
“It was death,” sophomore 
Alex Panteliodis said of his intro-
duction to the workout plan. “I 
thought I had joined the track team — I wasn’t playing baseball.” 
But as third-seeded Florida (47-
15) prepares for its first game in the College World Series against six seed UCLA (48-14) on Satur-day at 7 p.m., players are starting to see there is a method to their coach’s madness.
“It was just a matter of trying to 
get guys in shape and trying to get their attention,” O’Sullivan said.
He used a top recruiting class, 
an emphasis on conditioning and his expertise of pitching to put his imprint on the team.
Panteliodis is a prime example 
of his coach’s effect on the pro-gram. He has lost 20 pounds since enrolling at UF in 2008 and it has translated on the field. 
The sophomore, who is expect-
ed to be named the starting pitcher for Saturday’s game, has seen his ERA fall from 4.38 in his freshman year to 3.26 this season.
“Losing the 20 pounds has al-
lowed me to finish through on my pitches, and I have gained a lot of velocity through it,” Panteliodis said. “It’s really exciting to learn what (O’Sullivan) knows.”
The entire Gators pitching 
staff has benefited from hav-ing O’Sullivan around. He was a pitching coach at Clemson for nine years, and his knowledge in the area is evident.
When he took the position, the 
team was coming off a season in 
which it posted an ERA of 5.27. 
But in each of the three years O’Sullivan has been the coach that number has improved. This 
season, the team achieved a 3.96 
ERA.
“I think it’s better this year 
than last year because we have 
main starters,” Panteliodis said. “Last year, we rotated a lot with everybody, but this season I think everybody found a role and found a position.”
Panteliodis and freshmen Hud-
son Randall and Brian Johnson have been the team’s weekend ro-tation for most of the season. The three have played their best in the NCAAs, allowing just nine earned runs in 35 innings while strik-
ing out 10 batters per every nine 
frames.But this three-year fast track to 
the CWS wasn’t planned.
“We did not put a timetable on this thing when we got here,” 
O’Sullivan said. “We just took it 
one day at a time.”

When Team USA takes on Slove-
nia, everything will be on the line.
After a 1-1 draw against  Eng-
land, the Yanks need to defeat Slo-
venia on Friday at 10 a.m. in Ellis 
Park Stadium to take hold of Group C in the 2010 World Cup. 
Lose or tie, and the Americans’ 
likelihood of advancing takes a big hit.
If the magnitude of the match 
wasn’t enough, trash talk has filled the tabloids this week as Slovenia’s 
Andrej Komac guaranteed victory. 
U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard re-
sponded.
“Talk is cheap. They’ve got to 
stand toe to toe with us for 90 min-
utes,” he said. “And if he’s still 
standing, then I’ll take my hat off to 
him. But a lot of boxers talk, too, and they’re looking up at the lights. And 
the next thing they know, they’re 
trying to figure out how they got there.”
Well, at least the U.S. seems fo-
cused.
While guile and grit propelled the 
U.S. to a draw in its opening match, to defeat Slovenia, the Yanks need to have precision and control. 
After the England match, Team 
USA coach Bob Bradley commented that the Slovenia match would be much different, saying it would be 
more like a game of chess. 
Bradley’s first move in the pro-verbial chess match could be a line-
up change. 
While Ricardo Clark was respon-
sible for England’s only goal, he still played stellar defense, but he offers nothing in terms of holding the ball 
or pushing forward. Look for young 
Jose Torres to take Clark’s spot in the central midfield. 
“Torres’ quick, quiet feet on 
the ball calmed the U.S. during its friendly with Turkey, and he could 
have a very similar impact against 
Slovenia,” ESPN soccer analyst Luke Cyphers said.
Another possible adjustment in 
the U.S. lineup will be a change up top. The pairing of Jozy Altidore 
and speedy Robbie Findley was 
awkward, at best, in the opener. 
While Bradley has fallen in love 
with the traditional 4-4-2 style, in-serting a skilled winger like Stuart Holden could allow the U.S. to play 
a more possession-oriented game 
with more actual chances on goal. The formation would be more of a 
4-5-1; think Germany’s 4-0 win four 
days ago against Australia. 
Slovenia plays a compact, tight 
style and only counter-attacks as a means to score. 
Patience will be a key for the 
USA. 
The Yanks must take advantage 
of their opportunities and score off 
set-pieces, or they run the chance 
of failing to advance out of group play.20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 17, 2010

TAMPA — Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach John 
McKay will be the next inductee into the team’s Ring of 
Honor at Raymond James Stadium.
The club made the announcement Wednesday during 
a news conference attended by the late coach’s son, At-lanta Falcons president Rich McKay.
A ceremony is planned for Dec. 5, when the Bucs will 
wear orange throwback uniforms for a home game against the Falcons.
McKay, a national championship-winning college 
coach at Southern California who was also known for his quick wit and clever one-liners, coached the Bucs for the first nine seasons of the franchise’s existence. He retired 
in 1984 and died in 2001.The expansion Bucs went 0-14 in their inaugural sea-
son in 1976, then dropped the first 12 games the following 
season for a 26-game losing streak that still stands as a 
NFL record. In the franchise’s fourth season, Tampa Bay 
not only made the playoffs for the first time but advanced to the 1979 NFC Championship game.
McKay becomes the second inductee into the Ring of 
Honor, joining Hall of Famer Lee Roy Selmon.
“He was a great man with a great vision, who took on a big challenge,” said Selmon, the top pick in the 1976 draft.
Rich McKay shared stories about growing up around 
the Bucs, recounting how difficult the transition from USC to the NFL was on his father, who took the job with expectations of being able to field a competitive team right away.
“There were plenty of times when he could have 
walked away and said: ‘You know what, this is a little harder than I thought, it’s going to take a little longer than I thought, I can always go back and coach somewhere else,’” the Falcons executive said. “He wanted to finish 
the task. ... He did get the team turned around, and I think 
he would really enjoy the fact that in Tampa, his legacy is a positive one because he really had to work hard to get it to that position.”Bucs to induct ex-coach McKay into Ring of HonorNATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE
