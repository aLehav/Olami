UF students swarmed Turlington on Monday 
to witness President Bernie Machen’s shocked ex-
pression as he participated in latest social media 
phenomenon: the Ice Bucket Challenge.
Machen was nominated by UF journalism grad-
uate student Kéran Billaud and decided to com-
plete the challenge on the ﬁ  rst day of the semes-
ter. 
Gator football quarterback Jeff Driskel and 
Gator volleyball middle blocker Simone Antwi 
dumped the bucket of ice water on Machen in front a crowd of students.
Machen nominated Student Body President 
Cory Yeffet and Dave Kratzer, vice president for Student Affairs, to accept the same challenge.
“ALS is a horrible disease, so anything I can 
do to help raise money for ALS would be a good thing,” he said.
Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell also par-
ticipated in the challenge Friday afternoon in pub-lic at the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce building 
in front of a crowd of about 80 spectators.
“I was honored to be nominated and to be a 
part of this magniﬁ  cent and powerful fundraising effort for ALS,” she said.
Other local ﬁ  gures who accepted the challenge 
include Gator football coach Will Muschamp and 
several staff members of the North Florida Region-
al Medical Center. 
On Monday, the ALS Association reported 
$79.7 million from donations inspired by the Ice 
Bucket Challenge. Machen joins the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge trend

Floridians can head out to the polls 
today to vote in the primaries for the No-
vember elections.
Ofﬁ  ces on the ballot include gover-
nor, attorney general, U.S. representa-tives, circuit and county judges, county commissioners and school board mem-
bers.
Residents of Alachua County were 
able to vote early from Aug. 16 to Satur-
day, with a record 5,690 votes cast in the gubernatorial race, said Pam Carpenter, 
the county’s supervisor of elections. 
One of the polling locations is the 
Reitz Union. Despite renovations,  Reitz 
Union Assistant Director of Operations Tara Siler said they have set aside a loca-tion in the ﬁ  rst-ﬂ  oor lounge area. 
“We’ve done it in that location before, 
and it hasn’t caused an issue,” she said. “And it always depends on what’s on the ballot each time as to what kind of trafﬁ  c we get.”
Carpenter said students can avoid 
any trouble at the polls by checking votealachua.com. They need to have their address up-to-date and show up 
at the correct voting location, which is 
printed on their voter information card. They also need a form of ID such as a driver’s license. 
If students have completed absentee 
ballot but haven’t mailed them, they need to drop them off at the Supervisor of Elections ofﬁ  ce.  Fla primary elections today � THE COMPLEX ISN’T READY, SO 
THEY ARE STAYING IN HOTELS.

When students signed a lease to live at the 
new Grove apartment complex, they didn’t ex-
pect they’d be paying to live in a hotel.
Taylor Trache, a 20-year-old UF telecom-
munication junior, moved a quarter of her be-longings into the Hilton UF Conference Center on Saturday after she received a call about a day before she was planning to move into the Grove.
“I like to be organized when I start school,” Trache said. “Now I have to live out of a suit-case.”
Students who took out leases at the Grove 
are currently staying at 10 different hotels, ac-cording to Rob Dann, the chief operating of-ﬁ  cer of Campus Crest, which owns the Grove 
complex. The hotels include the Hilton, the Hil-
ton Garden Inn and the Best Western, which is more than 8 miles from campus.
The Grove told Trache the latest she’d be 
staying in the hotel is next Wednesday, but she thinks it will be longer. When she drove by the complex on Sunday, she said the ﬁ  rst two buildings looked ﬁ  nished, but the others still had exposed cement, drywall and wooden 
beams.
“We are working diligently to get the resi-
dents in as quickly as possible,” Dann said in 
an emailed statement.
Trache, who signed her lease in March, 
thinks the Grove should dock her rent for Au-gust.
“It’s stupid,” Trache said. “My rent is very The Grove residents displaced

Man dies after being shot with 
stun gun by deputy LAKE CITY — Authorities say a North Florida man died after a deputy shocked him with a 
stun gun.
The Columbia County Sheriff’s Office reported that 35-year-old Timothy Griffis died Sunday after deputies responded to reports of a man lurking in an elderly woman’s backyard in Lake City.Deputy Bradley Carpenter told the sheriff’s office he ar-rived at the house and found 
Griffis hiding in a shed.
The office said Griffis sig-naled that he had a gun and threatened Carpenter.Carpenter told Griffis he was going to use his stun gun, but the office said Griffis made an “aggressive movement” to-ward Carpenter, who fired.
The Florida Department

Rabbi Adam Grossman has been working as the execu-
tive director and CEO of UF Hillel since July 7 and is now 
serving as the organization’s active rabbi.
Grossman, 38, took on the role of rabbi after former rab-
bi Gail Swedroe, the organization’s first female rabbi, ac-
cepted a job in Texas, according to her farewell statement.
Grossman said his mission as CEO and acting rabbi is 
to connect with students on campus and inspire them to 
find a home and purpose through the help of the organi-zation.
Grossman, formerly the associate 
rabbi at the Temple Israel in Memphis, said he is working toward changing the way people view Hillel.
“For the last seven weeks we have 
done a lot of redesigning and reimagin-ing on the indoor space and ultimately on how we can transmit ourselves to the greater community,” he said. “One of the things we’re really trying to do is be 
a partner — a partner with the greater community, a part-ner with the university, a partner with students.”
Allan Goldberg, UF Hillel Board of Directors president, 
said it’s a great challenge keeping up with Grossman and all his ideas. Goldberg was a member of the selection com-mittee responsible for hiring Grossman.
“Rabbi Grossman is a very energetic and entrepreneur-
ial leader,” he said. 
“He’s basically turning the Hillel world on its head, 
making some major changes and looking at some different opportunities for Hillel to broaden itself to a larger group of students than it typically has,” Goldberg added.
Goldberg said Grossman’s entrepreneurial spirit in-
spired the decision to hire him as UF Hillel’s new CEO and later appoint him as its rabbi.
Scott Raileanu, UF Hillel’s director of operations and 
engagement, knew Grossman when he served as an as-sociate rabbi at Raileanu’s home congregation and joined Grossman’s team after he personally recruited him.
“He was pretty much a religious and spiritual mentor 
for me and sort of a life mentor for me,” Raileanu said.
Raileanu said Grossman’s passion and desire succeed 
is evident after working with him.
“There’s going to be no stone unturned by Adam Gross-
man to make Hillel successful and make the students that walk in our doors have a meaningful experience.”UF Hillel appoints

Campus was quiet after students 
left for the summer, yet the sounds of 
drilling continued as UF’s major con-struction projects moved along.
The Reitz Union is in the construc-
tion and renovation phase of its $75 million redesign. Cydney McGlothlin, UF Planning, Design & Construction project manager, said steel was put up and concrete work was completed. 
The Reitz Union Rion Ballroom is 
being rebuilt and will be a floor higher. It will be finished this Fall along with the basement, which will hold the 
dance studios, a computer lab and an 
emergency hurricane shelter.
“It’s going really well,” McGlothlin said. “We can see a big difference.”
The construction of Cypress Hall, 
a future residence hall on the corner of Southwest 13th Street and Museum Road, is progressing well, said Sharon Blansett, assistant to the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs.
“Substantial completion of con-
struction is on track to be April 2015,” Blansett said in an email. “This will al-low staff time to prepare the facility for 
opening Fall 2015.”
Heavener Hall, an undergraduate 
building for the Warrington College of Business Administration, is also nearly 
finished, McGlothlin said.
However, all the construction is 
causing some complaints. 
Reitz Union Hotel guest services 
coordinator Lorna Bouret said guests have complained about the noise.
Bouret has seen the campus change 
since graduating in 2008, and she said 
she’s excited for the additions.
“Time goes by so quickly,” Bouret 
said, “and it’s needed. It takes time to 
make updates.” 
Construction on Reitz Union is ex-
pected to be finished in 2016. McGloth-lin said she is looking forward to hav-ing one location for all students to get involved in activities. 
“I’m thrilled,” she said. “It will be 
well used when it’s open.”Construction continues around campus
“It’s going really well; we 
can see a big difference.”

The Grove is paying for her room as 
well as breakfast and dinner buffets at her hotel’s restaurant.
The Grove is also providing storage 
pods to students, Dann said, which will be locked and guarded. Trache said she didn’t trust leaving her stuff in a pod be-cause her things might get mixed with another person’s.
Trache doesn’t know how she’ll get 
to campus. Though Dann said the Grove is providing shuttles, Trache said she 
doesn’t know how that process works.
She said she doesn’t think the Grove 
understands the effect this delay has on 
students and parents. Her dad had to take time off from work to help her move her stuff and is going to drive up again when she moves into her apartment.
Natalie Pan, a 17-year-old UF nutri-
tional sciences freshman, said the worst part is she can’t buy groceries while she’s at the hotel because there’s no fridge.
Pan said she’s staying optimistic but 
isn’t that worried if she has to stay in the hotel past next Wednesday.
“I don’t mind it,” Pan said. “I love ho-
tels.”
Pan, who’s staying with her roommate 
in the hotel room, said she didn’t know the Grove was offering storage until she accidentally drove by the units.
“I feel like my stuff’s safe for the most 
part,” Pan said.
But Trache is still upset.“The worst part about this is that I have 
to wait to get my new fish,” she said.It should be finished Sept 34 ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, AUGUST 26, 2014

James Horvath, a master lecturer in the 
Department of Chemistry, is no longer teach-
ing General Chemistry 2, or CHM2046, this semester.
The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences 
decided to restrict the multi-decade instructor to only working in Chemistry 1 and Chemis-try 2 labs.
“It is not unusual for someone’s teaching 
assignments to change at UF,” UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes wrote in an email. “In this case, the Chemistry Department decided it does not need Dr. Horvath as a lecturer in the year ahead. As a result, he will be able to focus 
on his laboratory duties.”Collin Zeng, a 19-year-old UF biology 
sophomore and one of Horvath’s teaching as-
sistants, said he thinks Horvath should at least be available to those students who wish to truly learn chemistry in-depth, so he created a petition on change.org addressed to the De-partment of Chemistry asking for Horvath to regain lecturing privileges.
Students have had mixed reactions: Some 
vehemently support Horvath, and some think the department made the right decision.
Grant Sinnott, a 19-year-old UF economics 
and mathematics sophomore, said that as an executive secretary in Student Government, he heard complaints about the class and con-ducted an in-depth review of the class. Based on the research, the decision made sense, he said.“The problem wasn’t the difficulty but the 
standardization,” he said. “We felt like in a general educational class, you should receive 
the same education. It’s not fair for one professor to teach certain chapters and others to teach something different.”
Sinnott examined the 
syllabuses for the chemistry 
classes and noticed some outliers and discrepancies in what is taught in the 
class. Horvath’s class was an outlier.
Horvath wrote in an email, “The real issue 
is about all students studying in American in-stitutions of higher learning — not me.”
Chemical engineering sophomore Jacob Cottrell had Horvath in the Spring for Chem 2 and chose him purposefully even though he heard Horvath was more difficult.
“(Horvath) said, ‘People find my class dif-
ficult because I want you guys to learn chem-istry. Chemistry is not easy, so I’m not going to make it any easier than it is,’ and he stuck true to that,” the 19-year-old said.
“He would explain a really weird concept, 
and at the end, he would laugh about it and ask, ‘Isn’t that really amazing, guys?’”
As of press time, the petition had 378 sup-
porters.
“On the first day of class he always tells the 
stories about himself, and he concludes the class with a review,” Zeng said. “The review actually said, ‘When bad people die and go to hell, they go to Horvath’s lecture.’”

After five years and more than 30 
low-cost spay and neutering proce-
dures every day, No More Home-
less Pets reached its goal.
The nonprofit organization sur-
passed a total of 20,000 surgeries 
this month with its Operation Per-
Snip iniative since it was founded in 
October 2009. Since then, euthanasia 
rates have plummeted 90 percent.
“It’s a milestone for us,” said 
Sandi Richmond, the organization’s 
director.
The seven-member team oper-
ates four days a week, offering cat services for $50 and dog services for $80. The charge covers the opera-tion, anesthesia and pet pain medi-
cation. Richmond said other services 
include rabies and distemper vacci-nations, feline leukemia and AIDS shots, heartworm tests, nail trims and flea control for about $15 each.
The shelter is currently offering free microchip services.
“We want to take away those 
large expenses from you and make it affordable,” Richmond said.
No More Homeless Pets recently 
received a grant that will enable the organization to offer 400 free spay and neuter services to qualifying, low-income Alachua County resi-dents starting this September, she 
said.
The free services will be available 
to students on Federal Pell Grants 
as well as on a first come, first serve 
basis. There is a limit of two pets per 
qualifying household.
“We’re working to be a no-kill 
animal shelter by 2015,” Richmond said.
Vernon Sawyer, director of the 
Alachua County Humane Society, said No More Homeless Pets and Operation Catnip, an different ini-
tiative by the UF College of Veteri-
nary Medicine, has had a significant effect on the community’s stray ani-mal population.
“Even though we get busy, we 
have less intakes than we did eight, nine, 10 years ago,” Sawyer said. “They’ve absolutely made a huge impact, not just them but Operation 
Catnip.”Operation PetSnip reaches 20,000 pets spayed, neutered

ANDERSON, S.C. — Confronted several 
times by hecklers demanding immigration 
reform, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio told attendees 
at a Republican fundraising barbecue that no 
country has been more generous to people from elsewhere than the United States.
Rubio, whose parents left Cuba in the 
1950s, mentioned his childhood as part of a family of immigrants during his keynote ad-dress at the fourth annual “Faith and Free-dom BBQ” fundraiser hosted by U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-South Carolina.
The event in Anderson, the state’s con-
servative northwestern corner, has become a go-to stop for Republicans with strong na-tional profiles and potential presidential con-
tenders. U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, 
headlined last year’s event.
Rubio has been trying to recover from his failed push for an immi-gration law overhaul, now seen as a political misstep. 
He helped write the bipar-
tisan immigration over-haul that passed the Senate but stalled in the House as 
some Republicans balked. 
Conservatives grew wary 
of the measure, and the Republican-led 
House signaled that the comprehensive Sen-ate plan would go nowhere.
The Florida Republican also stressed the 
importance of innovative educational pro-grams, saying a four-year college degree isn’t necessary for middle class success.
“I don’t know why we have stigmatized 
vocational and career education,” Rubio said. “We need more programs that help people graduate from high school and get ready to go into one of these professions.”Rubio boosts SC Republicans Horvath

Alachua County Animal 
Services will have free adop-
tions for the next week.
The $100K Challenge, 
sponsored by celebrity chef Rachael Ray and the Ameri-can Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals, 
invites shelters nationwide to compete for the most free adoptions in return for cash prizes, depending on staff 
size and capacity.
Nine other shelters are in 
the same division as Alach-
ua County Animal Services. 
Since the shelter began par-
ticipating in June, more than 1,000 animals have been ad-opted.
“Right now we’re tied for 
second or close to second,” said director Vernon Sawyer.
Sawyer said if the shelter 
wins money, the funds will 
go toward new dog toys, 
expanded play areas and in-creased community aware-ness about pet adoption.
Throughout the past 10 
years, Sawyer said the shelter has increased its adoptions by about 90 percent. A por-tion of those saved lives are 
due to the numerous rescue 
organizations in Gainesville, such as the Alachua County Humane Society.
The Humane Society’s di-
rector, Amanda Burks, said the organization has been working with the shelter for the past 13 years. Staff mem-bers adopt animals that are at risk of being put down.
“We normally get about 50 
each month from animal ser-vices,” Burks said. “The ma-jority — about 90 percent or 
more — are pulled from their 
euthanasia list.”
As adoption rates soar, eu-
thanasia among animals de-
clines, said Burks, who attri-
butes the shelter’s success to organizations like No More Homeless Pets and Operation 
Catnip. Both groups work to 
spay and neuter pets and fe-ral cats.
Alachua County Ani-
mal Services is also up for a 
$25,000 community involve-
ment award, and the winner is determined by social media votes. Sawyer said locals can 
vote at votetosavelives.org.
“We adopted out about 
100 animals this weekend, 
but there was a day a couple months ago where we got 70 
animals in one day,” Sawyer 
said. “Five, six, seven years ago we were euthanizing quite a bit of animals. We’ve 
worked our butts off not to.”Animal shelter to

Janet Nobles leaves her Ocala 
home before dawn to get to work 
in Matherly Hall.
By 6:30 a.m., she’s circling 
around Parking Garage 4 on Museum Road and the Stephen C. O’Connell Center parking lot 
searching for a coveted space, 
even though her work day isn’t supposed to start until 8 a.m. 
Yet she still struggles to ﬁ  nd a 
parking space on UF’s campus.
“If you want parking, you bet-
ter get here early, or you’re go-ing to park farther away,” said Nobles, a 46-year-old ofﬁ  ce man-
ager in the UF Department of 
Economics.
Construction on the chemistry 
building broke ground last week, permanently eliminating 106 
spaces for faculty and staff, said 
Scott Fox, director of UF’s Trans-portation and Parking Services.
And commuters will have to 
brace themselves for more con-struction in the Spring, as anoth-er 46 parking spots will be lost within the gated lot in front of Dauer Hall, near the inﬁ  rmary.While there are no plans to 
create more parking, nine dis-
abled spaces from the chemistry 
building parking lot were moved to the north of Fletcher Hall and the disabled employee spaces 
were moved to Fletcher Drive. 
Additionally, three carpool zones within the campus core were moved into a parking lot near Frazier Rogers Hall on Museum 
Road and Center Drive.

a roadblock for 
representation
It’s no secret that Americans are frustrated and disillu-
sioned with Congress. A recent Gallup poll found that a whopping 83 percent of Americans disapprove of the fed-
eral legislature’s performance. In another poll, Gallup found 
that just 19 percent of Americans believe most members of Con-
gress deserve to be re-elected, nearly a historic low.
Clearly, the overwhelming majority of the American people 
feel Congress is not adequately representing their interests.
One of the most significant obstacles toward a more respon-
sive, representative Congress is the practice of gerrymandering. 
The U.S. Constitution mandates that congressional districts 
must be redrawn every 10 years. The power to redraw these dis-
tricts is granted to the state legislatures.
In theory, redistricting is designed to create districts that ac-
curately represent the constituents of a state. Unfortunately, the 
majority party in the state legislature often uses redistricting as an opportunity to draw districts that benefit its partisan allies.
This process, the act of redrawing districts to favor a specific 
political party, is known as gerrymandering.
Florida is an excellent example of how gerrymandering ob-
structs and perverts the democratic process. In Florida, 39 per-
cent of registered voters are Democrats, 35 percent Republicans.
Despite the nearly equal distribution of voters between the 
two major parties, Republicans hold 17 of the state’s 27 House 
seats to the Democrats’ 10. 
Gerrymandering has a major effect on congressional repre-
sentation. In 2012, Congressional Democrats received about a million more votes nationwide than did Republicans. 
Despite the Democrats’ advantage in the overall vote count, 
Republicans currently hold a 234-199 majority in the House. Re-
publican control of the House is largely a result of gerrymander-
ing by Republican-dominated state legislatures.
Unfortunately, an opportunity to curtail the destructive ger-
rymandering process in Florida was squandered this month. 
In July, Terry P. Lewis, a judge in Leon County, ruled Flori-
da’s new congressional districts unconstitutional, calling them a “mockery” of the redistricting process.
Lewis suddenly and sharply reversed course on Friday, ap-
proving new congressional maps that contained only mild, su-
perficial changes from the ones that he so harshly criticized. 
Lewis’ approval of these districts ensures that Floridians will 
continue to be inaccurately represented on Capitol Hill.
Gerrymandering isn’t solely a Republican problem; Demo-
crats have engaged in the same behaviors previously and likely 
will do so again given the opportunity. 
However, the degree and scope of Republican gerrymander-
ing over the past several years has helped to produce a Congress that looks nothing like the people it is meant to represent. 
Ending gerrymandering won’t bring an end to the ineffec-
tiveness of Congress. But appointing nonpartisan commissions in each state to redraw districts would be a major step toward a more representative and responsive federal government.

bursar’s email about losing your direct deposit account information? Today’s question: Did you vote in the primaries? In Defense of the Ice Bucket Challenge
Just a couple of weeks ago, I logged into my Face-
book and saw that I was tagged in a friend’s status. It was a video of someone pouring a bucket of ice 
water all over herself and nominated me, along with a few others, to participate in something called the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. 
I remember feeling quite confused about a couple of 
things. First, — and I’m embarrassed to admit this — I 
had no idea what ALS even was. Second, what did soak-
ing yourself with ice water have to do with anything? My 
attention was held for only a few moments before I lost 
interest and continued binge-watching Mad Men on Net-
flix. I had no plans of getting ice water poured on me, nor 
did I feel any connection to the cause my friend’s video 
was promoting. 
Eventually, I became one of those people who went 
from ignoring the Ice Bucket Challenge to downright 
criticizing it; I did so while still not understanding what it was raising money and awareness for. All I knew was 
that my Facebook feed was flooded with people getting 
ice water dumped on them, and, quite frankly, I was tired of it. “Another one bites the dust,” I would think, feeling proud of myself for not succumbing to peer pressure like everyone else. Besides, wouldn’t donating 
money be more effective than posting a silly video on 
your social media account? What was the point?
Fast forward a few weeks, and I was finally moti-
vated enough to go online and find out more for myself. 
After just a few moments of research, I was no longer 
ignorant about the devastating effects of ALS. Amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis is a horrifying neurodegenera-tive disease that slowly and painfully robs its victims of 
the ability to control their muscles, speak, swallow and 
even breathe. Also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, ALS comes in stages, each more devastating than the next, and usually results in death from respiratory failure within a few years. As I scrolled through various 
descriptions of the disease on-line, I could feel my heart racing 
when I tried to imagine how it 
must feel to be diagnosed. And then, as I continued to learn 
about ALS and the desperate need for research fund-
ing, I felt an uncomfortable emotion well up inside of 
me: shame.
I felt shame for rolling my eyes at everyone posting 
videos of the Ice Bucket Challenge. I felt shame for sar-castically remarking that throwing ice water on your-
self doesn’t raise money. Most of all, I felt shame for 
self-righteously deciding that ALS wasn’t worth all the hype.
According to an ALS Association press release, there 
have been more than $70 million donated from July 29 to Aug. 24, compared to only $2.5 million raised dur-ing the same time period last year. But even if the Ice Bucket Challenge hadn’t succeeded in raising millions of dollars for ALS research, everyone who participates 
is performing a compassionate service. 
The people affected by ALS must have an incredible 
amount of courage to face a disease with no cure or treat-
ment. At the very least, the rest of us can bring attention 
to their hardship. The Ice Bucket Challenge gives us a 
way to talk about ALS and acknowledge the struggle of those living with it. If it weren’t for the challenge, many people wouldn’t have become informed about the dev-astating nature of ALS, myself included. 
To the ice bucket haters: Don’t be so hasty to dismiss 
something that brings hope and encouragement to so many people. Though the Ice Bucket Challenge might seem silly on its face, these viral stunts have the poten-
tial to inspire powerful and meaningful action.

Last year the U.S.-China trade deficit 
was $318 billion. The U.S. Department of Commerce calculates the deficit by 
subtracting the value of what we import from what we export, which accurately cal-culates the overall trade deficit. However, this method is misleading and potentially damaging to the U.S. economy.
The DOC assumes that when a product 
imported is from a particular country, such as an iPhone assembled in China, it is the country that makes the whole product. An American-made chip exported to China for iPhone assembly would be accurately re-corded, as the current method accounts for the exchange. 
However, if a German microphone is 
exported to China for iPhone assembly, the Census Bureau records the entire iPhone as a Chinese import, despite the microphone’s origin. Despite this flawed assumption, almost every report on the impact of trade between the U.S. and Chi-na uses this statistic.
To account for internationalization of 
production, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development is creating a “value-added” method to calculate trade deficits. Instead of counting the whole iP-hone as a Chinese import, the OECD would account for what countries add to products, counting the microphone as a German im-port, for example. 
Reuters and other news outlets reported 
how OECD officials were “startled” when the value-added method reduced the U.S.-China trade deficit figure by a fourth.However, articles from Slate, 
Reuters and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics blasting the new statistics forgot to mention that a comprehensive table of 
countries’ trade activity is needed to calcu-late accurate trade deficits. 
So of course, the incomplete value-added 
statistic reduced our Chinese trade deficit, as the OECD officials’ correspondence with Reuters was premature. The OECD officials neglected to consider China’s exports to oth-er countries that may enter the U.S.
Even the Brookings Institution, a repu-
table D.C. think tank, perpetuated lazy jour-nalism by claiming that China contributes only 3.6 percent of the value of the iPhone. The writer assumed that non-Chinese com-panies did not have labor based in China, which isn’t always the case.
No institution has put forth an accepted 
estimate on our trade deficit using the new method, and thus, reports on the trade defi-cit, concerning bubbles, job losses and other factors associated with it are groundless.
Though it may seem somewhat pedantic 
and obscure, accurately calculating the U.S.-China trade deficit could play an important role in determining future economic policy. 
If we’re importing more from China, we 
may need to crack down on Chinese cur-rency manipulation at the expense of cordial relations. If we’re importing less, we may want to focus on reinforcing research and development to maintain our competitive edge. There’s no way to make an informed decision without knowing the truth.

Current method of calculating trade deficit damages economyGuest Column
Earlier this month, a panel of three judges from 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit struck down Virginia’s voter-approved ban 
on gay marriage. The decision comes as the latest in a series of recent lower-court rulings defending 
marriage equality as a constitutional right, a trend 
that some conservative pundits have incorrectly criticized as an exercise in judicial activism.
Prominent Republicans are vocal in their vigi-
lant opposition to judicial activism. Conservative evangelist Pat Robertson said “an out-of-control judiciary is the single greatest threat to democ-racy and the religious and moral foundations of America,” and Gov. Chris Christie, R-New Jersey, 
denounced the Supreme Court rulings on DOMA 
and Proposition 8 as inappropriate acts of “judi-cial supremacy.”
Speaking of the same decisions, Sen. Ted Cruz, 
R-Texas, explained to the Texas Republican Con-vention, “Judicial activism is judges imposing their policy preferences on the words of the Con-stitution.”
These Republican leaders are wise to be wary 
of judicial overreach, but accusations of judicial activism do not apply to the recent wave of lower-court rulings in favor of gay marriage.
The court system is designed to ensure adher-
ence to the principles of the Constitution. These decisions, like the most recent ruling in Virginia, overturn existing marriage bans on the grounds that they are unconstitutional. Judge Henry Floyd wrote in the 4th Circuit decision that banning same-sex marriage “is precisely the type of seg-regation that the Fourteenth Amendment cannot countenance.”
Judges who interpret laws based on the Con-
stitution are not engaging in activism but are do-ing their job and duty to our county. Ted Olson, the lawyer who argued and won the case against Prop 8, stated simply, “it’s not judicial activism when judges do what the Constitution requires them to do.”
Whether GOP politicians believe judicial activ-
ism has been involved in marriage equality cases, the party would benefit from the courts legalizing 
same-sex marriage.
The GOP is on the losing side of the gay mar-
riage debate and faces disillusioning its younger 
members. Pew Research reports that 61 percent of Republicans under the age of 30 support same-sex marriage, yet the party resists policy change. This is attributed to the 12 percent of the popula-tion and loyal Republican voters who subscribe to socially conservative doctrines.
The party does not want to turn its back on its 
base. A Supreme Court ruling would resolve this dilemma for the Republican Party, taking the con-troversial social issue off of the table.

Dear President Ber-
nie Machen,
As a student 
here at UF, I would like to let you know that it’s 
OK to be wrong. There is no shame 
in admitting a past mistake. And as our president and formal spokesman, it is time that you publicly apologize for comments you made in December 2013 when you spoke out against the American Studies Association’s call for a boycott of Israeli academic insti-tutions. You spoke too soon — surely 
without fully realizing the ramifica-
tions of what you were saying. I’m sure that you simply did not under-stand the full extent of the war crimes Israel has carried out against Palestine; nor did you know that you would be marginalizing a large number of stu-dents who attend UF by speaking on their behalf without consulting them.
As you said in December, “I be-
lieve the entire University of Florida community holds academic freedom to be a cherished principle that ad-vances the interests of society.” Well, Machen, you’re right. We do hold that to be a cherished principle. However, we hold it to be a principle that must be ensured for all people, and I know 
that now you must realize a boycott 
of Israeli institutions is necessary. Palestinians have their academic free-doms almost completely denied by Israeli institutions. Palestinian places of learning and dialogue are not safe: Universities have been bombed by the Israel Defense Forces, and scholars and students alike have been unjustly 
arrested, deported and, in many cas-
es, even tortured and killed by Israeli forces. There is little to no mobility for Palestinian academics, as the apart-heid system does not allow them to leave their places of residence without incredibly hard-to-come-by permits, and they are also not allowed to fly from the Tel Aviv airport.
As an academic and president of 
a university, which holds academic freedom to be such a central value, I am sure you must now understand why a boycott of Israeli institutions is necessary to ensure that Palestinians are granted basic human dignities. Israeli academic insti-tutions and the Israeli 
military are intertwined. Israeli uni-versities are highly militarized, and they create the culture of occupation and settler colonialism that you must stand against. 
For example, military intelligence 
and training for the Shin Bet, the se-curity service that is known for its torture techniques, is provided at 
University of Haifa and Hebrew Uni-
versity. Furthermore, the Mount Sco-pus campus of Hebrew University is partially built on illegally confiscated Palestinian land in occupied east Je-rusalem. Israel has been found guilty of countless violations of international law. Machen, I have faith that you will stand on the side of justice and honor 
Palestinian civil society by condemn-
ing these affronts to human rights.
As I said, we all make mistakes. 
What you said in December against the cultural boycott was a mistake. At least now you have the opportunity to fix it. There is no doubt in my mind that any moral, rational being would stand on the side of Palestine after 
seeing the horrendous crimes against 
humanity that have been carried out by Israeli forces during Operation Protective Edge. 
Since July 7, more than 1,100 Pales-
tinians have been killed. According to the United Nations, more than 70 per-cent of those are civilians. I know you have a soul, Machen. I know you have 
a heart and can no longer help fund 
and support the monstrous military and occupation that can so ruthlessly massacre thousands of helpless Pal-estinian women, children and men. And I also know that you will stand by us, your students, in supporting a student referendum calling for divest-ment from the Israeli occupation. I be-
lieve in justice, and I believe that you 
do, too.

Gainesville Regional Utili-
ties is warning business owners 
about a recent phone scam.
Herb Firsching, a director at 
GRU, said scammers generally 
target restaurant owners. Scam-
mers will call during lunch hours when they are busiest, he said. They demand that the res-taurant purchase a disposable debit card and make a payment within 45 minutes or be at risk of having their power shut off. 
Firsching said the scam de-
mands payment that is typical-ly more than each customer’s balance, so businesses should check their statements before believing the calls.
Customers who suspect 
a scam should contact GRU directly before making a pay-ment. Firsching said GRU never demands payment over the phone and typically notiﬁ  es customers about their power being shut off through a letter in the mail. 
Firsching said GRU has sent 
out warning emails and is in the process of making an auto-mated phone message regard-ing the scam on their customer service hotline. 
Gainesville Police spokes-
man Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said scams are common and that the issue is not limited to GRU. He 
said with any suspicion, hang 
up the phone and call the busi-ness’ listed telephone number.GRU warns of recent

Students looking to take on another class 
before the drop/add deadline can consider a 
different type of hands-on learning.
UF has formed a three-year partnership 
with the Crime Scene Investigation Acad-
emy of Florida. The academy on 12787 U.S. 
Highway 441 in Alachua will work with the UF’s forensic science program to provide crime scene training to accommodate its on-line courses.The CSI Academy provides training to 
law enforcement ofﬁ  cials looking to practice their crime scene investigative skills.
The PHA 6935 Crime Scene Laboratory 
course being offered to students in the UF forensic science master’s program will kick off this Fall.
For the ﬁ  rst time, students can partake 
in hands-on training, including skeletal re-
mains recovery, bloodstain pattern analysis 
and death investigations.
Training for the three-credit crime scene 
laboratory course will be held the ﬁ  rst week of December with 24 spots open. The online and hands-on course is offered through the UF College of Pharmacy each semester with $100 lab fee.
Karen Smith, CSI Academy director of fo-
rensic education, said there has been a surge of interest in the forensic science program.
“A lot of students had asked for a hands-
on component since it’s an online program,” 
she said.
Three students have signed up for the 
course so far, and about 1,000 students are 
enrolled in the online master’s program.Ian Tebbett, associate dean of the College 
of Pharmacy, worked with the academy to get the curriculum completed for the Fall course.
Tebbett said the 14-year-old online grad-
uate program in forensic science is one of the largest. 
“It’s an opportunity for students who 
have bachelor’s degrees and work in law 
enforcement to get a master’s with UF with-
out having to quit their jobs and relocate,” he said.  
Tebbett worked alongside CSI Academy 
Dean Tony Falsetti to get the course up and running. The academy plans to continue working with UF to create undergraduate hands-on courses as well, Falsetti said.UF partners with Fla. Crime Scene Investigation Academy

Corey Jermaine Sawyer, 30, was arrested 
during a trafﬁ  c stop at 2400 E. University 
Ave. shortly after midnight Monday, said Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben To-bias.
An ofﬁ  cer pulled Sawyer over and saw him 
chewing as he approached the vehicle. The of-ﬁ  cer said he smelled cannabis in the car and noticed a clear plastic bag 
by Sawyer’s thigh. 
After having his Miran-
da rights read to him, Saw-yer said he chewed the marijuana because he was afraid and didn’t know what else to do.
Tobias said 2.5 grams of 
marijuana were recovered. 
Sawyer is being charged with possession of marijuana and tampering with evidence.

Gainesville Police warned of a door-to-
door scam Monday involving a well-dressed woman in her 40s.
The scammer talked a 91-year-old woman 
out of $200 this month.
The victim heard a knock on her door at 
about 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 2, Tobias said.
The woman at the door appeared dis-
tressed and told the victim she lived down the street and needed the money to get to Georgia to see her mother, who she said had a heart attack. 
The woman said she and her husband 
worked at Home Depot and would return in a week to pay the victim back.
The victim said the woman didn’t appear 
homeless or intoxicated, nor did she force her way inside her home.

The Hyppo, a St. Augustine-based 
frozen treat eatery, is expanding be-
yond its downtown Gainesville loca-tion within the next two months. New locations are set to open in Roberts’ 
Stadium Club on University Avenue 
and on Butler Plaza between McAlis-ter’s Deli and CiCi’s Pizza.  There will also be carts spread throughout Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium on gamedays.
“There’s a lot of momentum to 
move out and beyond in the retail sector,” said general manager Brent Smith.
Four UF locations—the Hub’s 
P.O.D. Market, Graham Oasis, Little Hall Express and Rawlings Plaza—began selling The Hyppo’s ice pops in December.
Abby Doupnik, a UF journalism ju-
nior and employee at the downtown location of The Hyppo, attributed the business’ popularity to the unusual idea of an ice pop store.
“They’re a novelty item,” Doupnik, 
20, said. “The fact that Gainesville has a popsicle store but not every other 
city does is kind of a cool thing.”
Savannah Collins, 19, picked out 
a coconut and chocolate ﬂ  avored ice 
pop at the downtown location. 
“I’ve never seen a popsicle store

With a strong backline that con-
sists of three veteran players, there 
is little doubt that Florida’s defense can hold its own.
But what about its offense?
With the graduation of Chloe 
Mann, Florida loses its most produc-
tive scorer and the NCAA record holder for career hitting efficiency (.476).
While coach Mary Wise recog-
nizes the improbability of replac-ing Mann, she said junior Simone Antwi, sophomore Shainah Joseph 
and 6-foot-4 freshman Rhamat Al-
hassan are more than capable of covering the position.
“It would be unfair to them to ask 
them to pick up exactly where Chloe left off offensively,” Wise said, “but there are signs of what they may be able to do in blocking that’s further than Chloe was at this time.”
The trio may not be at Mann’s 
level yet, but Alhassan’s height, Antwi’s breakout sophomore year and Joseph’s fast progression in col-legiate play could prove to be lethal against opponents.
In 2013, Antwi started all 32 
matches and completed the year with a .377 hitting percentage and 3.07 points per set while leading the team with 96 blocks. Her junior status gives Florida at least another year with the players and allows the two other middle blockers – Alhas-san and Joseph – time to learn how 
to connect on the court before she 
leaves.

Alex McCalister plans to 
make the most of his 7-foot-2 
wingspan.
“My long arm pass rush 
is my golden ticket,” the redshirt sophomore said. “There’s not a lot of people 
that can stop that.”
To do that, the defensive 
lineman out of Clemmons, 
N.C., has watched tape on a variety of players who have 
a similar technique.
J.J. Watt, the 2012 NFL 
Defensive Player of the Year who has 36.5 career sacks 
through his first three years of professional football.
Jadeveon Clowney, the 
No. 1 pick in the 2014 NFL 
Draft and a two-time first-
team All-America and All-Southeastern Conference team selection.
Barkevious Mingo, who 
paced LSU with 12 quarter-back hurries and tallied 8.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks in 2012 before becoming a first-round draft pick by the 
Cleveland Browns.
Now, McCalister and the 
rest of Florida’s defense is 
shifting its focus to Idaho 
and Saturday’s 2014 season 
debut.
“Getting into Idaho, get-
ting into the first game you start seeing stuff starting to 
condense and slow down,” 
McCalister said. “We’re starting to focus on schemes, what their people do, so it’s 
better just to focus on them 
not having to worry about not hitting (Jeff) Driskel ev-ery play.”
In addition to McCalister, 
who coach Will Muschamp said has gained a lot of confi-dence heading into his third year at Florida, the rest of the 
defensive line is beginning to 
shape up.

With the preseason and two regular sea-
son games in the record books, one thing is 
certain: The Florida soccer club has depth.
That depth throughout the 25-member 
roster is what will drive them for the dura-tion of the season.
“One of the things that’s a real positive 
about this team is our depth,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“I think we will continue to see that 
grow as the season goes on.”Since the preseason, the Gators have 
shown how their practice has molded the team to play as a whole instead of indi-vidually.
When the team plays as a unit, results 
are generated, but once an individual de-
cides to manage the gameplay solo, things 
fall apart.
During Sunday’s match against South 
Florida, Florida caught itself in a situation that could result in future mishaps if re-
peated throughout the season.
“There was a period in the beginning of 
the second half where we sort of started to 
play more individually and that’s just not our DNA, that’s not what our team func-
tions on,” Burleigh said. “Making sure 
that we stick to the plan and trust that pro-
cess.”
Remaining with that 
original game plan is what boosted Florida to 
a 2-0 start to the season.
Only six of the 25 players on the roster 
have not appeared in a minute yet due to either injury or freshman inexperience.
One of those six players is senior Karina 
Gutsche, who has been out with an MCL sprain. Burleigh does not expect her to be back for this weekend’s matchups against Oklahoma and Oklahoma State.
“The timeline, we sort of look at it day-
by-day,” Burleigh said. “She’s definitely progressing. She’s doing some running 
and things like that now, but it’s one of 
those things we just have to take our time 
with because she’s a big piece of what we 
do and the way that she plays is entirely 
physical. 
“So we want to make sure that she is 
really ready to go and we don’t put her in a situation where we jeopardize a longer-term injury.”
The other 19 players have consistently 
rotated between both games, but the start-ers have still logged the majority of the minutes.

keeper Taylor Burke have each played all Deep roster provides support for starters in opening weekend

While some might knock the 
Gators for their lack of veteran 
runners, coach Paul Spangler is 
embracing the influx of youth the 
Gators women’s cross country team has on its roster. 
When UF opens the season at 
the Western Carolina Invitational on Friday in Cullowhee, N.C., 
Spangler will field a team that, for 
the first time in his three-year ten-ure, features no seniors.
With nine of 11 runners being 
underclassmen, it would be easy to accuse the Gators of having an ab-sence of veteran leadership.
But freshman Lauren Brasure, 
redshirt freshman Becky Greene and sophomore Taylor Tubbs have Spangler confident the team will face no shortage in the leadership 
department.
“Rebecca Greene, she was (the 
Southeastern Conference) fresh-
man of the year, she has a lot of 
international experience, so we’re 
going to be counting on that,” Span-gler said. “Lauren Brasure from Michigan, and she’s arguably one of the top cross country runners in 
the country. Right there with Tay-
lor and Becky, and no doubt those three girls, I feel like the potential is there to do a very good job in terms 
of picking up where both Agata 
(Strausa) and Cory (McGee) left off with the cross country team.”
Originally from New Zealand, 
Greene was a two-time champion 
at the New Zealand National Cross 
Country Championships in 2010 and 2011. Greene joined the roster in January, making this her first fall 
running for Florida.
Tubbs is looking to capitalize 
on a strong freshman campaign, 
which saw her finish as a top-five 
scorer in all six meets she ran in. 
Spangler says that he’s counting on Tubbs to be a leader, despite only being a sophomore.
“Taylor Tubbs came in as a very 
good high school athlete out of the state of Florida, and has really just blossomed,” Spangler said. “She’s 
had great summer training and has 
looked great in practice, and even though she’s a sophomore, she’s going to be counted on for leader-
ship within our top runners, and 
no doubt she’s ready to take on that role.”
On the men’s team, The roster 
faces little turnover, losing only 
junior J.L. Hines and senior Mark 
Parrish, who exhausted his four years of cross country eligibility.
“(Parrish) was the South re-
gion champ, so certainly he will be missed,” Spangler said, “but for the most part everybody is back be-hind him.”
Despite losing their top runner, 
the Gators return seniors Jimmy Clark and Eddie Garcia for the 2014 season.
Clark and Garcia ended 2013 
on the All-South region team after finishing second and ninth, respec-tively, at NCAA Regionals.
Spangler has also seen promise 
in sophomore Carlos Miranda and 
redshirt junior David Kilgore. Af-
ter being named to the 2013 SEC All-Freshman team, Miranda has impressed Spangler in practice.
Kilgore, a transfer who was a re-
serve on the 2013 National Cham-pion Colorado cross country team, 
hopes to find a place on the Gators 
team after struggling with the alti-tude that being a Buffalo required.
“It’s very rare that an athlete 
doesn’t react well to the altitude, he’s one of these athletes who just didn’t react well to altitude,” Span-gler said. “We’ve added the ele-ment of speed and endurance, and 
he’s really reacted well to it. He 
brings leadership to the group, he’s extremely hard-working and no doubt this will rub off really well 
on this freshman class.”
The men’s team welcomes eight 
freshmen to a talented team, giving 
the Gators options to find quality fourth and fifth runners.
When the he U.S. Track & Field 
and Cross Country Coaches As-sociation released its preseason regional rankings on Monday, the 
men’s team ranked third in the 
South region, while the women were picked to finish eighth.
“I think the potential is there to 
have a much, much better season 
than we did last year,” Spangler 
said. “I’m very optimistic for what the future holds, certainly as we move into the regular season and 
postseason and the SEC Champi-
onships.”

Taylor Tubbs races during the Southeastern Conference Championships on Nov. 1 at the Mark Bostick Golf Course. Tubbs is the lone runner on the Gators women’s cross country team that scored in multiple meets during the 2013 season. The sophomore as well as redshirt freshman Becky Greene are two athletes coach Paul Spangler believes will take on a leadership role this season.Jacobs now in the NFL, red-
shirt senior Leon Orr, senior Darious Cummings and ju-
niors Dante Fowler Jr. and 
Jon Bullard will provide leadership and experience for the group. 
Last season, the quartet 
combined for 119 tackles (20.5 for loss), 8.5 sacks and 13 quarterback hurries.
“They’ve been in our pro-
gram, they understand the 
expectation how we need to 
play on defense here,” Mus-champ said. “I feel good 
about us continuing to build 
that depth.”
Redshirt sophomore Bry-
an Cox Jr., sophomore Joey Ivie and redshirt freshmen Jay-nard Bostwick and Caleb 
Brantley in addition to Mc-
Calister will receive playing time as well.
“We feel much better 
right now about being able to roll guys like we like to up front,” defensive coordina-tor D.J. Durkin said. “We’re going to do that, and we feel 
good about the ability to do 
that because of how they’ve done through camp.
Muschamp also said true 
freshman Gerald Willis, the No. 6 defensive end recruit in the 2014 class according to 
Rivals.com and one of Flori-
da’s five true freshmen along the defensive line, will see the field at some point this season.
“He’s going to play. How 
much, I don’t know right now,” Muschamp said. 
“Assignment wise he 
needs to be on top of things 
in what we’re trying to do 
and the communication of that.”fresh to collegiate play – Joseph only 
played in four matches her fresh-man year and Alhassan, originally a basketball player, began playing volleyball in her junior year of high school.
With the two players’ limited ex-
perience, Florida will have to focus heavily on the defense to give the 
two players a chance to learn the 
game, and Wise has already recog-nized it.
“If (Sunday’s) scrimmage is any 
indication, this team is going to dig a lot of balls,” Wise said. “The offense was really good, but the defense re-ally outshined them in terms of the number of balls that were kept in 
play.”
The use of three seniors — libero 
Taylor Unroe and defensive special-
ists Holly Pole and Maddy Mon-serez — on the back line in addi-tion to junior Nikki O’Rourke will be beneficial to the middle blockers and will move Florida away from its 
previous approach of a dominating 
offense to a faster and stronger de-fensive game.
Going forward, Wise said the fo-
cus for the middle blockers is to just help the younger players learn the game.
But the team is focused heavily 
on one specific middle blocker that could completely change Florida’s 
offense: The raw potential that is Al-
hassan.
The freshman will still see a sig-
nificant amount of playing time be-cause of her height.
The Glenarden, Md., native is the 
tallest player in the history of Florida volleyball and has a big jump to add to that height.
“Our video coordinator brought 
in video this morning of a play she made where she literally is chest 
high above the tape,” Wise said. “There are so few women in the 
country that can make that play. You could argue there aren’t that many in the world.”180 minutes this season.
But the bench is what has kept the team stable on 
Friday and Sunday.
“There’s going to be players that will continue to 
emerge as the season goes on,” Burleigh said. “We 
are starting way ahead of where we started last year at this point. The fact that we’re getting contribu-tions on a regular basis from our bench is only going to help us in the long haul of the season.”
Another contribution to the team’s depth has 
been a mixture of scoring.
It started with forward Jillian Graff, who scored 
Florida’s first two goals of the season and became the sixth Gator player to have a double-goal game in a season opener.
Graff also recorded the fourth fastest season-
opening goal for UF and the fastest since 1999.
As a result, she earned a share of the Southeastern 
Conference Co-Offensive Player Of The Week award alongside Georgia’s Gabby Seiler.
Forward Savannah Jordan and midfielder Annie 
Speese also found the back of the net in the opening weekend.
Jordan turned in the third goal of the night versus 
Miami, and Speese had a double-goal game herself against USF.
“I think anyone on this team can start,” Graff 
said. 
“We really have great depth on the bench and 
what it comes down to is coach’s decision, but we’re all capable of doing it.”
