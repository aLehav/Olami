Faculty union cries out
against salaries, sick pay
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator org
The faculty union declared a deadlock Fri-
day in contract negotiations with UF over is-
sues such as salaries and sabbaticals.
Union members argued UF is refusing to
compromise and isn't taking negotiations se-
riously.
They argued that UF's salaries are in the
bottom 10 percent of institutions in the Asso-
ciation of American Universities, a group of
top research schools, and that UF is claiming
it doesn't have the money to raise them, even
though it plans to spend money on other ini-
tiatives, such as $12 million on a study center
for students and $10 million on hiring up to
100 new faculty next year.
"The data shows that the president and thetrustees have the money, they just don't want
to spend it on current faculty," said Chris
Snodgrass, head of the union's bargaining
unit.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes declined to
answer questions and said others involved
are not authorized to comment. Sikes released
a statement explaining UF's position.
"We understand that the budget situation
has been difficult, and we still face many chal-
lenges," the statement reads.
"Nevertheless, we have a $16 million recur-
ring budget gap to fill and we need to address
it. Regardless of the union-declared impasse,
we will continue to negotiate with the union
in good faith, and our ultimate goal continues
to be reaching a satisfactory agreement."
But Snodgrass said UF's negotiators aren't
playing fair. They cancel meetings, end them

The search continued
Monday for the passengers
aboard a plane that crashed
in Broward County Sunday
evening.
The plane is said to have
left Gainesville and was
headed to a Fort Lauderdale
executive airport, according
to the Associated Press.The single-engine plane
crashed around 6 p.m. near
U.S. 27 just south of the Bro-
ward/Palm Beach County
line, according to Broward
Sheriff Fire Rescue.
Because the
Local crash occurred
News in a remote loca-
tion in the Ever-
glades, the rescue crews had
trouble accessing the site. The
crews worked overnight Sun-
day and continued Monday.
BSFR confirmed one death,
and the continued search in-
cludes Broward Sheriff's Of-fice homicide detectives, BSO
marine and crime scene units,
the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission,
the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration and the National
Transportation Safety Board.
According to the FAA, an
unconfirmed report showed
that four people were seen
boarding the plane.
The plane is registered to
Bull Gator, Inc., in Sea Ranch
Lakes, according to the Asso-
ciated Press.
The cause of the crash has
not been determined.
Cyclist crashes into minivan, taken to hospital
A cyclist was admitted to Shands at UF
after crashing head-first through the rear
window of a stopped minivan at South-
west 13th Street and West University Av-
enue early Monday afternoon.
UF student Stephen Little, 24, was rid-
ing his brakeless bicycle north on South-
west 13th Street and entered the left turn-
ing lane toward West University Avenue,
according to a Gainesville Police report.
Little was unable to stop his bicycle intime to keep from hitting a minivan that
was stopped at the intersection, according
to the report.
The impact launched him into the rear
hatch window. His helmet shattered the
glass, and his neck and chin were deeply
cut by the metal window base, according
to the report.
According to the report, Little's injuries
may be life threatening.

Swamp ranks in Playboy
poll for best sports bars
Playboy named The Swamp
Restaurant among one of the best
10 college sports bars in the na-
tion.
"The Swamp is a frequent bar
that draws in die-hard UF football
fans, and that's why it made Play-
boy's list," said Playboy publicist
Abi O'Donnell. "It is a fun atmo-
sphere to hang out and especially
watch a game".
Ohio State University's The
Varsity Club and Oklahoma State
University's Eskimo Joe's joined
The Swamp on the list, which was
released on the Playboy Web site
Sept. 18.
"The Swamp is the most popu-
lar local watering hole," said Ron
DeFilippo, the restaurant's owner,
adding that hundreds of students
and alumni stop by on a weekly
basis and even more come by on
game days.
But football isn't the only en-
tertainment The Swamp offers. It
holds events like holiday parties
and Martini Tuesdays. It's even
had performances by Sister Hazel
and David Archuleta.
"Any award is good in my
business," he said. ESPN and
COED Magazine have also named
The Swamp one of the best college
sports bars in the nation.

Aramark lowers prices in response to complaints
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewa rt@a IIigator org
Students may now find their money going
a little further at the Reitz Union Pollo Tropi-
cal.
After students cried foul over high prices,
Aramark, UF's food service provider, lowered
them to more closely match the prices at other
locations across the state.
The biggest changes were made to the
menu's value meals, with one meal -the
quarter-chicken with two sides -seeing a
33 percent drop in price from $6.69 to $4.49.
Other value meals are between 50 cents and
$1.70 cheaper.
Meals in the TropiChops section saw price
drops of up to $1.40.
Students have also complained about the
prices at Cheeburger Cheeburger, which re-
placed the cheaper Wendy's chain.
Aramark may add cheaper items to the
menu. Possibilities include a smaller burger
-perhaps a 4-ounce burger in the $4 range -
and smaller milkshakes, said Bob Miller, UF's
associate vice president of business affairs.
Fries and drink combos might also change.
As for Pollo Tropical, Miller said the price
changes were made to reflect the prices at The
Florida State University's on-campus location,
but Aramark spokeswoman Jill Rodriguez
wrote in an e-mail that the changes were made
to bring the location in line with other corpo-
rately managed locations in the state.
Menus requested from other Florida loca-
Polio Tropicaltions indicate the prices are similar, though
there are differences. Some regular size meals
in the TropiChops section are still 40 cents
more at the Reitz Union location, while large
size meals are 10 cents cheaper.
Rodriguez wrote that because there are no
other Pollo Tropicals in Gainesville, Aramark
initially set the prices based on prices at simi-
lar restaurants in the area.
Some students weren't deterred by the
higher prices at the Reitz Union, however.
Pollo Tropical posted almost $73,000 in
sales during the first two weeks of fall. By
comparison, Capeesh -which was replaced
by Pollo Tropical this summer -sold about
$25,000 in the first two weeks of Fall 2008.
Cheeburger Cheeburger did well too, but it
didn't top Wendy's old numbers. It saw about
$75,000 in sales, versus about $92,000 by Wen-
dy's in the first two weeks of Fall 2008.
There are other changes at campus restau-
rants that may help students on a budget. The
Moe's Southwest Grill at the Student Recre-
ation and Fitness Center, for example, is now
offering a line of junior burritos.
Miller said the corporate office decided to
make the change when students complained
about the absence of the cheaper burritos.
The Reitz Union Subway is also offering $5
footlongs for the first time. Aramark put the
cheaper subs on the menu after it took over
operations from the franchisee, who had re-
fused to offer them, Miller said.
On-campus restaurants will still not be
able to offer free drink refills, as is common at
off-campus versions of the chains, though, be-cause of logistical hurdles.
"It's just logistically difficult to have a drink
island for customers but not for people just sit-
ting there studying," Miller said.
Nonetheless, students will likely be happy
with many of the menu changes. Environmen-
tal engineering junior Katie Graf said she'sglad Pollo Tropical dropped its prices. The
first time she ate there she didn't realize how
expensive it was until they rang her up.
"I was kind of put-off," Graf said. "I was
like, 'I'll probably be going to Subway more."'
"Now," she said, "I'll think about going
here [Pollo Tropical] more."

Number of students studying abroad down in 2009
By LAURA MONTALTO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Despite an increase in applicants for the
class of 2013, the number of students studying
abroad is down this year, acccording to the UF
International Center.
"The economy definitely is having an effect
on students' decision to go abroad. We're see-
ing that right now," said Kirsten Eller Laufer,
senior adviser at the UFIC. "Students want to
go, but the cost is a huge issue."
Prices range from $8,000 to $15,000 per se-
mester, Laufer said.
While the number of interested students
visiting the UFIC has slightly decreased, the
number of students who are actually able togo is even lower, she added.
"The recession is a definite factor because
we can't send every student," she said.
But Laufer said UF hasn't seen the same
large decreases that other schools across the
country have seen, and the number of scholar-
ships available through the UFIC hasn't been
affected. The UFIC gives $80,000 every year to
students going abroad for yearlong, summer-
long and semester-long programs.
"It's absolutely worth still going abroad,"
she said. "Today, going abroad sets you
apart."
Laufer offered some alternatives to stu-
dents who want to go abroad but don't want
to break the bank.
"Going during the summer is a great op-"The economy definitely is having

go abroad."

tion because it's more affordable," she said.
"We have summer programs that go from
three weeks to 12 weeks."
Laufer also recommended going through
a UF exchange program because students pay
UF tuition, which is much more affordable.
At UFIC's Study Abroad Fair, which takes
place Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. onthe Reitz Union Colonnade, students can meet
with facultywho teach overseas and find infor-
mation about outside study-abroad programs
and other UF-approved schools like Boston
University and The Florida State University.
Students can also ask peer advisers, students
who have already been abroad, questions.
"Students who want to go should get to the
fair as soon as possible because the brochures
the outside programs bring with them always
run out quickly," said Angela Grindal, UFIC's
event coordinator.
Despite the economy, the UFIC expects a
normal turnout on Wednesday.
"It's a great opportunity to see what's out
there, even if study abroad isn't feasible,"
Laufer said.

'Radical Rush' recruiting starts
By RENEE MONTALTO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Rush week is over, but not for the Civic Media
Center.
Wednesday through Friday, the CMC will hold its
biannual "Radical Rush" on the Plaza of the Ameri-
cas from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
CMC coordinator James Schmidt described the
event as a "drive for progressive activist groups on
campus.",
Radical Rush targets any student interested in
progressive or radical organizations for social change,
social justice or environmental protection.
Schmidt said the event is open to any student."Whether or not one is interested in joining a
group, it's a way to let students know about activi-
ties," Schmidt said. "It's about getting the word out
on what's going on around campus."
The rush process will end with a Friday night so-
cial at the Presbyterian and Disciples of Christ Stu-
dent Center at 7 p.m. A donation of $5 is requested,
but Schmidt said they won't turn anyone away.
Sherry Wolf, a gay rights activist and author, will
be at the student center to talk about the upcoming
National Equality March in Washington, D.C., in
October. She will also be promoting a book she has
recently written about LGBT issues.
The Civic Media Center is located at 433 S Main

www.N Rgov/Cate4"8-UF wants fewer sabbaticals
FACULTY, from page 1
early and decide not to honor agreements they've already
signed, he said.
"They keep taking steps to make it impossible to finish,"
he said. The negotiations have labored on for four years now,
with no agreement in sight, he said.
The impasse comes as UF is proposing to end a program
that converts unused sick leave to cash when faculty leave
UF. Faculty expressed their concerns about ending the pro-
gram at Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Snodgrass said the other issues that led to Friday's im-
passe include UF's unwillingness to allow faculty to take re-
search sabbaticals.
UF currently allows semester-long sabbaticals and wants
to cut down on them, while the union wants year-long sab-
baticals every seven years, like other universities, he said.
"Some faculty that have been here 20, 30 years and have
never had a sabbatical," he said.
Another issue involves intellectual property. The union
says UF wants to be able to force faculty to produce online
course content and other materials, which will be owned by
UF. The union says faculty shouldn't be forced to produce
content they will not even own the rights to.
Tom Auxter, first vice president of the union, said the
main issue is salary compression. Faculty are hired at mar-
ket rates and then are not given raises over time to keep their
salaries in line with other universities.
"You end up being unable to meet life's expenses and take
care of the development of your career," Auxter said.

Krafty Business
Food industry giants use
labels to fool consumers
ajor food corporations are hoping that the aver-
age American will cling to catch phrases rather
than read food nutrition labels.
First, the awesome refrigerator from "The Jetsons" was
"smart." Then, that tiny car next to you on Interstate 75
stopped being ridiculous and became "smart." After that,
Glaceau even managed to make water "smart." Now,
foods like Froot Loops, mayonnaise and Fudgsicle bars are
dubbed "smart," too.
"Smart Choices" was promoted as a universal nutri-
tional ranking system that would make it easy for consum-
ers to identify healthy foods without having to scour over
nutritional facts. However, since it is controlled by major
food industry players, it is closer to a marketing ploy than
a real nutritional system.
Companies behind this new program include PepsiCo,
General Mills and Kraft Foods. Each pays up to $100,000
a year to use the labels, according to a report by Mother-
Jones.com.
Because companies have to pay to use the label, "Smart
Choices" has a huge incentive to apply it to as many prod-
ucts as possible. To meet the "Smart Choices" criteria, a
product only has to be better than the nutritional worst.
For example, Froot Loops can get the "Smart Choices"
logo on the front of its packaging because it is a "smarter"
choice than other breakfast foods, like doughnuts.
Ideally, the United States wouldn't need a universal
nutritional labeling system to solve its obesity problem.
Some people just don't realize that eating a package of
Fruit Gushers doesn't count as eating a serving of fruit,
though.
On-the-go Americans who don't have the time or de-
sire to read nutritional labels deserve a system that's bet-
ter than "Smart Choices."
Labeling foods like Reese's Puffs as nutritional isn't
"smart," it's a deceptive scheme by companies trying to
profit off of ignorance.
Missing the Mark
A last, UF andAramark have re-
sponded to student
outcry over high food pric-
es on campus.
Prices at Reitz Union res-
taurants Pollo Tropical and
Subway now reflect similar
restaurants off campus.
Changes might be in
the works for Cheeburger
Cheeburger, the overpriced
replacement to Wendy's,
according to UF's associate
vice president of business
affairs.
We applaud Aramark
for actually responding to
the concerns of students,
but we have to ask: Whatmore can UF and Aramark
do to lower food prices?
Noodles are good and
all, but considering they
cost next to nothing to
make, they should never
cost more than $5.
In the meantime, let Ara-
mark know that as students,
you have other options for
lunch.
Save yourself a couple
of bucks and eat Krishna
Lunch on the Plaza of the
Americas. Step across Uni-
versity Avenue and grab
a slice of pizza. Better yet,
throw a Fruit-by-the-Foot
and some cheese sticks in a
bag and call it a day.

Freshmen: It's OK to not like college
question for first-years here at UF: How are youholding up?
It seems like a relevant question to ask during
week five of the semester. If this is your first year, you've
probably gotten a decent feel for the school and its people
and culture by now.
Plus, the first "actual" football game of the season was
this past weekend, and the first cluster of exams is prob-
ably popping up either this week or next.
Maybe most importantly, this is about the time when
the excited high of living away from home and being at
a new school begins to fade a bit, and people start ask-
ing themselves if this is the place they want to be. And
it's tough -possibly tougher at UF than at most other
schools -if the answer is anything other than yes.
Consider this: It's not a secret that UF has no short-
age of school spirit. We proudly don Gators apparel and
cheerfully end e-mails, voice mail greetings and occasion-
ally conversations with "Go Gators," and it's not just be-
cause our football team kicks ass. (They do, though.)
It's also out of necessity; ours is a school of about
50,000 students, and the culture of Gatordom affords
us all common ground when, given UF's size, common
ground would otherwise be hard to come by.
It's a bonding experience that's intensely effective, and
it's the reason why UF alumni who don't know each other
can have random conversations but graduates from, say,
the University of Phoenix usually can't. But if it doesn't
take for whatever reason -you have no previous con-
nection at all to UF, for instance, or if school spirit isn't
really your thing -it can be intensely alienating.
If you're already inclined to feel that way, the prob-
lem is only exacerbated because you're very much sup-
posed to like UF. When you're a freshman, there is in-deed a correct answer when people
ask how college is going -usually,
w"Yeah, UF's awesome, love it" or
some variation thereof -so that
you don't look too negative or out
of place. And it doesn't help that
Joe Dellosa very well-meaning freshman advis-
letters@alligator org ers and Preview leaders sometimes
treat having reservations and inse-
curities about UF not as a completely natural feeling but
as a disease that needs to be cured ("Get involved! Make
the campus smaller! Meet people in the laundry room!").
Don't get me wrong. There are so many reasons why it
is, in fact, great to be a Florida Gator, and you'd be com-
pletely justified if you've fallen in love with UF and the
people in it. But if you haven't, that's OK, too.
With all the talk of how college is supposed to be the
best years of your life, it's very easy to feel pressure to
make your college experience amazing and even easier
to get disappointed when your attempts fall short. You
might have gotten saddled with a bad stack of classes,
you're not clicking with the people you meet, or you just
really miss your friends back home.
And if it's any comfort, whatever your insecurities,
there are probably a dozen other people on your dorm
floor alone who are, to some degree, feeling the same way
-even if they say "Yeah, UF's awesome, love it" when
you ask them how things are going.
Remember, as exciting and exhilarating as college can
be, it can also be boring, frustrating and lonely, and that's
true for everyone. Feel free to factor that in when decid-
ing how you're holding up.

Letters to the Editor
Wall Street Journal should be available
As a McCain supporter and a conserva-
tive, I've always wished there was a more
conservative newspaper voice on campus.
And as a conservative supporter of the
Progress Party, I'm excited to see they are
supporting bringing The Wall Street Jour-
nal to campus alongside The New York
Times. They have proposed cutting waste-
ful spending in other places to achieve this
goal. It's refreshing to see a party that en-
compasses both sides of the spectrum when
making decisions.

Wasted SG money could fund paper
In a year when budget cuts incited out-
rage over the proposed elimination of The
New York Times, isn't it better to cut costs
that don't directly benefit students?
Each year Student Government spends
around $100,000 of students' tuition on
unnecessary internal costs. Money from
cutting this waste can go toward fund-
ing improvements such as expanding free
printing and offering The Wall Street Jour-
nal on campus along with the Times. The
Progress Party campaigned last year for SGpay cuts from day one by signing a pledge
that they would not receive any monetary
compensation for their executive positions.
They've also targeted specific unnecessary
programs, which can be cut or reduced im-
mediately, and reroute the funds to more
student-oriented initiatives.
Rather than lead with kamikaze legisla-
tion or defending wasteful spending dur-
ing budget cuts, Progress will continue lead
by example and make concrete proposals to
help the students, not themselves.

Scalpers show business sense
In response to the letter in Monday's Al-
ligator that called student ticket scalpers a
disgrace to Gator Nation: What a load of
crap.
The kid that's getting a hundred bucks
for a student ticket isn't a disgrace to any-
one. He or she is a testament to UF's War-
rington College of Business Administra-
tion.
Student season ticket holders are al-
ready hamstrung in that they can only sell
their tickets to people with Gator 1 cards.
If a hundred bucks is market value out inthe more or less free market of nonstudent
ticket prices, then the student who gets that
much for a ticket should be applauded.
We're in a recession. Even before that
was the case, jobs were scarce for student-
aged people in Gainesville (another direct
function of supply and demand in a college
town). The stereotype of the poor college
student is no myth, even at UF.
Buying student season tickets and sell-
ing them for 10 times face value is an easy
way to watch a relatively small investment
yield huge profits.
If you're struggling to make rent and
another student wants to pay you a lot of
money to watch Tim Tebow and Brandon
Spikes hit Lane Kiffin's boys in the mouth,
don't feel like you're a blight upon the
school for accepting the offer.

Community needs classical station
I can't tell you how much I miss classi-
cal music from UF radio. You have cut it,
perhaps, to give students a chance to report
news. But what is the community supposed
to do? Do you have no obligation to us?
It is very, very sad to live without mu-sic, and you don't care. I've never lived
anywhere without a good classical station.
Until now. This makes Gainesville an im-
poverished community.

SG official right to resign
I was surprised to hear of the story last
week about William Sedgwick, a UF Stu-
dent Government official who was arrested
on a DUI charge and resigned.
Eight years ago, UF had a Student Body
president who was arrested on a DUI
charge, which was an embarrassment to the
student body. But he remained in office.
It is a sign of sensible character that
Sedgwick resigned his public office and
that the SG president accepted it, accepting
responsibility for his lapse in judgment.
Of course, this does not excuse SG and
its long-running majority party for its on-
going lack of transparency or fairness to
UF's "independent" parties -but it does
show that there has been a modest ethical
improvement since my time at UF as a stu-
dent senator.

Campus political groups debate health-care reform
The forum was sponsored by Chomp the Vote
By LIZ BEHRMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students listened to fiery arguments sur-
rounding national health-care reform Mon-
day night.
About 60 people sat in the Pugh Hall Au-
ditorium while members of the College Dem-
ocrats and College Republicans answered
questions during the Chomp the Vote Health
Care Forum.
Chomp the Vote Director Jenna Stern said
the purpose of the debate was to inform stu-
dents about the issue of health-care reform.
"They now know the Democrat and Re-
publican platforms, where they stand and
LOCALhave a better understanding about why the
debate is so heated," she said.
Representing the College Republicans
were Bryan Griffin and Johnathan Lott, while
Eric Conrad and Ben Cavataro represented
the College Democrats.
Each side had one minute to answer each
question, and the opposing team had 30 sec-
onds to make a rebuttal.
The panel discussed points such as the
fiscal responsibility of the proposed reform
strategies, the efficiency of Medicare and
Medicaid versus private insurance and other
ways besides a public health insurance option
that could offer coverage to all Americans.
Although both sides had differing opinionson the matters, they agreed reform is neces-
sary.
"We're both trying to achieve the same
goal here," Griffin said.
"We're both tying to keep
people alive for as long as
possible."
Throughout the debate,
the College Republicans
argued against a public op-
tion for health care, while
Conrad the College Democrats
were in favor of it.
"This is a chance for people to choose their
care, stay alive longer and have a better qual-
ity of life," Conrad said."I think if somebody was undecided,
hopefully they have made up their mind by
the end of the night," said sophomore Jacob
Smith, a member of the College Democrats.
Smith said he thought the debate was a
little redundant at times but was very infor-
mative.
Stem said she was glad the debate brought
the issue to the attention of the students.
"Chomp the Vote really wants to engage
students," she said. "Our job is to register and
educate the campus about what's going on
locally, in the state and in the naLion."
Stem said the two groups asked Chomp
the Vote to set up the debate. She said they
might consider hosting similar events in the
future. For now, she said, this was just a fo-
rum for students to argue their opinions on a
national issue.
Gainesville nonprofits struggle with decreased funding
By ERICA JOHNSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
In a period when joblessness is
common and businesses are closing
left and right, some of Gainesville's
nonprofit organizations are feeling
the crunch.
Alachua Habitat for Humanity, a
local branch of the national organi-
zation that builds and repairs hous-
es for the poor, is struggling against
decreased funding and staff.
Courtney Middleton, the man-
ager of the Alachua Habitat for Hu-
manity Thrift Store, said despite the
fact that people are often forced to
buy used goods during financial cri-
sis, sales are down.
The store sales, which are usu-
ally about $2,000 a day in a healthy
economy, have dropped to as low as
$200 and average about $700.
"We have a lot of people com-
ing in, but they still want stuff for
cheaper than we can give," Middle-
ton said.
The main source of income for
Habitat for Humanity, which has
built more than 100 homes in the
county since January, is donations.
The regular monthly donations are
continuing to come in, but sponta-
neous donations are down, said Peg
Iwata, Habitat for Humanity's re-
source and development manager.
The decline has inspired staff to
take new approaches to fundraisingby hosting events such as auctions, will be holding is a large auction But despite the efforts to make up

Rather than focusing on buying
chunks of land and building neigh-
borhoods, she said, they are begin-
ning to shift back toward buying
small pieces of land or having them
donated and asking for people in the
community to help out.
But some organizations, such as
Rebuilding Together North Central
Florida, a fellow home-repair or-
ganization, are not feeling strained
from the recession, said Melisa Mill-
er, the group's director.
"We are a smaller organization
that hasn't grown as large as some
of the others have," Miller said. "We
are already used to working on a
shoestring."
Rebuilding Together is a 4-year-
old organization that specializes in
emergency home repairs, accessi-
bility for the elderly and energy ef-
ficiency.
Miller said she believes one of
the reasons the organization has
been able to withstand the economic
condition is that they help improve
what has already been built rather
than doing any development them-
selves, much like Habitat for Hu-
manity's new plan.
"It's very interesting for us, be-
cause we have been receiving more
donations than ever," Miller said.
"I think a lot of times when there's
a recession people concentrate on
what's most important."
Homeless awareness activist announces city commission run
* FITZPATRICK HANDED OUT FOOD
IN FRONT OF CITY HALL MONDAY.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
For his 18th birthday, Patrick Fitzpatrick
asked for a pair of flashy track shoes for the
upcoming season. For his 50th birthday, he
was hoping to find a gift-wrapped ticket to the
UF-Tennessee football game.
For his 60th birthday, Fitzpatrick wanted to
get arrested.
As a light drizzle fell on the large signs that
read, "Would Jesus Feed the Homeless?," "5th
Meanest City" and "Homeless Rights are Hu-
man Rights," near the stairs of Gainesville City
Hall, Fitzpatrick and a few others broke the
law Monday by handing out food to Gaines-ville's homeless population.
The law, passed in 2003, prohibits the non-
city-sponsored distribution of food in front of
City Hall.
"We're breaking this law because we have
a conscience," said Fitzpatrick, who didn't get
his birthday wish. "I don't care who they are
-nobody can tell us who we can or can't give
a sandwich to."
Af ter the display of civil disobedience, Fitz-
patrick, longtime homeless awareness activist,
announced that he will run for the 4th District
city commissioner seat, which will empty in
March when its current holder, Craig Lowe,
runs for mayor.
As the homeless munched peanut butter
sandwiches and chocolate cake in cadence
with faint, live accordion music, Fitzpatrick
assured observers and reporters of the serious-
ness of his campaign and the need to resist the
ever-growing power of current officials, whohe referred to as "the robber barons."
"The curve of politics typically goes in fa-
vor of the wealthy," he said. "The curve of jus-
tice, however, goes to the poor."
If elected, one of his first orders of busi-
ness will be to rescind the 130-person limit on
the amount of food served at the St. Francis
House shelter. Fitzpatrick plans to establish a
permanent place for homelessLocal residents to stay.News Danny Griggs, a Hawthorne
resident who assists Fitzpatrick
in caring for the homeless, believes the restric-
tions imposed at the St. Francis House need to
be addressed immediately.
"I saw with my own eyes a pregnant wom-
an get turned away because she happened to
be No. 131," he said. "That's just not right."
According to Griggs, one of the main prob-
lems contributing to Gainesville's homeless
problem is a misguided perception that allhomeless residents have only themselves to
blame for their circumstances.
"They're smart people," Griggs said, men-
tioning innovations made by homeless people
to survive such as secretly cultivated gardens
in which they grow assortments of vegetables.
"Some of them just can't do it by themselves."
"Over there are the really stupid people,"
he said, pointing to the tall buildings across
from City Hall that house local businesses.
To David Wayne, who has been homeless
for the past four months, the issue isn't about
politics or winning elections -it's about get-
ting the next meal. Wayne, whose battle with
leukemia made his face jerk and contort as he
speaks, sleeps near the courthouse. But despite
his problems, Wayne said the efforts of home-
less advocates like Fitzpatrick give him hope.
"You won't see worry in my eyes; I got a
secret," he said, pointing to the sky. "My secret
is God."

UF searching for
solution at receiver
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF wide receiver Riley Cooper shows his frustration after dropping a pass during Florida's 23-13 win
against Tennessee in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Saturday.7"
right now," Meyer said after Sat-
urday's 23-13 victory. "I sit in my
bed at the hotel room, and I watch
this, and I'm thinking we're going
to pull out eight blazing receivers.
We're not doing that right now. We
have to get better at receiver."
Injuries and illness may be
partly to blame. Wide receiver De-
onte Thompson did not play due
to tightness in his hamstring, Riley
Cooper was bothered by a pinched
nerve for most of the game and Her-
nandez was battling the flu, which
caused him to be put in isolation
Friday. Receivers coach Billy Gon-
zales admitted Sunday that contin-
gency plans had been drawn up in
case Hernandez was forced to sit.
UF coaches and players also
pointed to a Tennessee defensive
game plan geared around not giv-
ing up the big play. Meyer said the
Volunteers played zone the entire
game, taking away the Gators' deep
passing threat.

UF FOOTBALL
Meyer credits UT personnel
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer

The Volunteers' defensive game plan suc-
ceeded in limiting the Gators' usually high-
powered offense Saturday.
It is a scheme future opponents are likely
to use in an attempt to have the same type of
success Tennessee had, but UF coach Urban
Meyer thinks the personnel on the field had
a lot to do with it, citing last season's game
against UT as an example. The Volunteers held
the Gators to just 243 yards of total offense in
2008 and quarterback Tim Tebow had only 96
passing yards.
"The year before, (former Tennessee defen-
sive coordinator John) Chavis did a nice job as
well," Meyer said. "I think the common theme
is great players."
That doesn't mean the Gators won't see
other teams trying to recreate some packages
drawn up by UT defensive coordinator Monte
Kiffin.
Tebow certainly expects to see more oppo-
nents playing the same style of defense as the
Volunteers.
"I'm sure we will see a lot of what they did,but we just have to get ready for it," Tebow
said.
MORE FLU: The flu bug has struck again.
This time, it was a member of the coaching
staff who was affected. Wide receiver coach
Billy Gonzales had a 104 degree fever Monday
and was receiving treatment
for the flu.
Running back Jeff Demps
and tight end Aaron Hernan-
dez were both feeling better
after struggling with flu-like
symptoms during Saturday's
game.
Meyer Defensive end Jermaine
Cunningham is still showing signs of the vi-
rus.
INJURY UPDATE: Meyer said wide receiver
Deonte Thompson (hamstring) and linebacker
Brandon Spikes (Achilles) are probable for
Saturday's game against Kentucky.
Thompson worked with a track coach to
help speed up recovery. As for Spikes, Meyer
said he just has to be smart because he has a
type of injury that tends to linger.Gators can't explain WR play
pparently explaining thelack of production from
Florida's wide receivers
is harder than anyone thought.
When the media had the op-
portunity to speak with senior
receiver David Nelson and wide
receivers coach Billy Gonzales
after practice Sunday, we were
expecting them to help us figure
out what went wrong against
Tennessee.
No wideout caught more than
three passes, gained more than 26
yards or made a single play lon-
ger than 14 yards as Tim Tebow
threw for a mere 115 yards on
the day.
Anyone watching the game
could tell UF had no way of
stretching the field with Deonte
Thompson sidelined, and the
receivers that were on the field
often failed to get open or evencatch the
ball.

RECEIVING AGAINST UT.
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@a IIigator org
A casual glance at Saturday's
stat sheet might lead a casual ob-
server to think there was a typo.
In every Florida football game
dating back to 1997 until the Ten-
nessee game, one Gator had at least
30 receiving yards.
That streak -156 games (and
likely longer, but individual box
scores from 1996 and earlier are not
readily available) -came to an end
against the Volunteers, when tight
end Aaron Hernandez and wide re-
ceiver David Nelson led the Gators
with 26 yards.
The closest UF previously came
under coach Urban Meyer was Dal-
las Baker leading the Gators with 31
receiving yards in Florida's 21-17
loss at LSU in 2005.

Gators fail to have 20-yard pass play for first time since '05
RECEIVERS, from page 14
try to let [Riley] Cooper -Deonte couldn't
play -run by a guy," Meyer said. "You're
not going to run by a guy that's retreating.
"We like man coverage around here. You
get us man coverage, it's a little easier to op-
erate."
Florida may also finally be feeling the de-
parture of Percy Harvin and Louis Murphy,
who are starting in the NFL this fall.
In the Gators' first Southeastern Confer-
ence game without the duo, they had no pass
play longer than 18 yards. Gonzales grades
his unit on "big plays" of 20 yards or more,
and Saturday was the first time UF failed to
have such a gain in the passing game since
Nov. 5, 2005 against Vanderbilt -47 games
ago.
"Could we use Percy Harvin as a play-
maker and everything? Absolutely," Tebow
said. "But I think the other guys are doing a
great job. There was games when Percy was
here when we weren't just running 80-yard
touchdown runs too."
There were no aerial trips to the end zone
either Saturday. Tennessee held Tebow with-out a touchdown pass for the first time in
his 30 starts at UF. The last time the Gators
didn't record a passing touchdown was in
2005 against LSU.
"Players make plays, the play doesn't
make the player," Gonzales said. "You've
seen plenty of receivers over the last four or
five years catch a hitch and take it the dis-
tance."
No one seemed ready to
put the blame on a specific
player or position Sunday
night. Nelson, a redshirt se-Football nior, said it's the receivers' job
to get open but subsequently
said UF wideouts were suc-
cessful in getting open.
Gonzales pointed to UF's success on third
down -24/36 (67%) through three games
-as a testament to his position group's con-
tribution. Florida converted eight of 13 third-
down opportunities against Tennessee. Half
of those came through the passing game, the
longest being a 18-yard screen pass to Her-
nandez on third and 14 in the second quar-
ter.
"We're really damn good at it right now,"
Gonzales said. "We've gotta make sure that'sa money down for us."
A big question is whether any you
wide receivers will be able to develop in ti
to add depth this fall. The method to ga
ing the coaches' trust is production in Tu
day and Wednesday practices, players a
coaches agreed.
Redshirt freshmen Frankie Hammond
Omarius Hines and T.J. Lawrence have be
mentioned as possible options, but no
caught a pass against the Volunteers.
"We've never been (big on) the wo
gamer," Gonzales said. "You've gotta ma
the plays over and over in practice."
The upcoming game against Kentuc
will give Florida wideouts their next cha
to shine. The Wildcats are 45th in the nati
in passing defense, allowing an average
185.5 yards per game, including 245 yar
against Louisville last week.
"I'll never say that we're not as explos
as we used to be or we're not as good as
used to be," Nelson said. " I think we're eve
bit as good as we were last year, we're j
looking for an opportunity to prove that.
"Maybe we didn't show it this past we
end, but we won the game. That's all ti
matters."

Jessica Warshaver / Alligator StaffKYLE, from page 14
explanation for what happened on the
Gators' side of the ball.
Yet, what we got from Nelson and
Gonzales was an eventual dismissal of all
the plausible explanations.
Somehow all three starting wide re-
ceivers graded out as champions, which
means that Nelson, Riley Cooper and
Brandon James did what was asked of
them on almost every play, according to
Gonzales.
It's hard to believe they were never
asked to make a play in the passing game
in between blocking for the running
backs.
Either way, it wasn't the receivers
fault. They did what was asked of them
according to the coaches.
Perhaps it was more a matter of the
personnel that wasn't on the field, as
explosive Andre Debose and Thompson
watched from the sideline.
"We've got playmakers now," Gon-
zales said. "We just have to make sure
we put them in the right spots to make
plays."
OK, so not a lack of playmakers.
Maybe the coaches didn't put them in
the right places at the right times.
"Players make the play, it's not the
plays that make the players," Gonzales
added no more than two minutes later.
Now I'm confused.
On the one hand, it's the coaches re-
sponsibility to put them in a position
to succeed, but on the other hand, it's
ultimately the players' responsibility
to make plays regardless of the what is
ng drawn up.
me But we already know the receivers
in- must have taken care of that responsibil-
es- ity, they graded out as champions, re-
nd member?
Alright, maybe it was that under-
[r.' achiever Tim Tebow. Or that offensiveen line.
They had to be the ones messing things
rd up. After all, you can't get the ball to the
ke receivers without blocking and throw-
ing.
ky "It's never the quarterback and it's
ice never the offensive line, so it's got to fall
on on our shoulders," Nelson said. "I put
of the blame solely on us, and we watchedds film today. There were some plays where
ive we could've been open. There were some
we plays where some guys were in the wrong
ery spot at the wrong time at the wrong situ-
ust ation."
Wait a minute, I thought you guys all
ek- graded out as champions?!
hat But how do you grade out as champi-
ons if you're not getting open?
"We were open," Nelson added. "We
were open this weekend. We were mak-
ing plays. We made some plays this
weekend that we were really excited to
see."
Didn't you just tell us that the blame
fell solely on the receivers?
And that there were plays when you
could've done a better job getting open?
But now you were actually open the
whole time?
After talking to Gonzales and Nelson,
we can eliminate the coaching, the lack of
personnel, the quarterback, the offensive
line and the receivers themselves as rea-
sons for the poor performance.
Either Eric Berry and Co. were bet-
ter than we thought, or the definition of
"champion" has significantly slipped in
Gainesville.
