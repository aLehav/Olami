  They moved up and down en 
masse, a wave of white and red. 
  Jumping, pumping their ﬁ  sts in 
the air and waving towels in the north end zone, nearly 70 players rushed the ﬁ  eld from the Georgia sideline to celebrate Knowshon Moreno’s leaping touchdown.
  Half of the packed stadium in 
Jacksonville went wild. The other half sat stunned. 
  The move was a motivational 
ploy from Bulldogs coach Mark Richt, who, after taking the job six years earlier, had won just a single contest against bitter rival Flori-da. In 2007, Richt said he had had enough. After Moreno scored in the ﬁ  rst quarter, his troops followed their orders. 
  “I told them if they didn’t get a 
celebration penalty after our ﬁ  rst score, all of them would be doing early morning runs,” said Richt af-terward. 
  Twentieth-ranked Georgia went 
on to a convincing 42-30 victory against No. 9 Florida. The result of the game didn’t have a huge impact, but that act, that unforgettable ex-ploitation would be immortalized. 
  It lives on forever in the lore of one of the greatest rivalries in the history of college football. It lives in the minds of fans, and it rises deep from inside players on Halloween weekend each year. 
  One of the few seniors on the 
roster who was present that day, defensive tackle Jaye Howard, said he had not seen anything like it.
  “I’ve never witnessed that in a 
football game before and just to see it, was like — they don’t care about Florida, really,” he said. “You don’t do anything like that. ... Total dis-respect.”
  Florida running back Chris 
Rainey, who watched the Bulldogs smile and gloat that day, said he will remember it always, even when he sits down decades from now to watch the game. 
  “All I can remember of this team 
is when they were dancing on us,” he said. “That’s embarrassing. That stays in my head when people do something like that to me.”
    
  For all the similarities Will Mus-
champ shares with his predecessors, the Gators’ ﬁ  rst-year head coach is completely different when it comes to rivalry games. 
  In the week before a matchup 
with Tennessee, his ﬁ  rst against a traditional foe, Muschamp and his players didn’t want to talk about history. They didn’t want to talk about the Volunteers and what the game meant to them. 
  Instead, the talking point all 
week was “nameless, faceless,” meaning Florida was approaching each opponent the same each week. No team deserved special prepara-tion, or merited extra motivation. 
  “It’s a very important game; we 
don’t need to tell our players that,” Muschamp said in September. “They come to play at a place like Florida to play in a game like this. That’s why we approach it that way.”
  That measured and calcu-
lated method continued against top-ranked teams like Alabama and LSU. But after losses in those games, followed by another on the road against Auburn, things have changed around Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
  Inside the building that houses 
the same team that has denounced big game after big game all season, one highlight has been played on loop.
  “They’ve been showing [the 
celebration replay from 2007] all throughout the building the last few days and all during the off week,” Howard said. 
  What began as motivation for a downtrodden pack of Dawgs has become the driving force for a des-perate bunch of Gators.
  That’s something Urban Meyer 
or Steve Spurrier would have done. Both were known for the importance they placed on rivalries with Geor-gia, Tennessee and Florida State. 
  Spurrier once said the Florida-
Georgia game is “the biggest game of the year.” After losing to UGA during his Heisman season of 1966, Spurrier held a special hatred for Georgia. When the series moved to a home-and-home format for two years in the mid-90s, Spurrier boast-ed about scoring 50-plus points be-tween the hedges in Athens, Ga.
  “That’s what we wanted to do,” 
he said. “This may be the only time in our lifetime that Florida plays here, so we wanted to make it mem-orable for the Gators.”
  After “The Stomp,” Meyer was 
the same way. He became en-trenched in the rivalry.
  A year later, with less than a min-
ute remaining in a 49-10 Gators victo-ry, Meyer called two time outs, forc-ing the Bulldogs and all their fans to endure the loss for just a little longer. 
    
  The rivalry between two of the 
south’s most prestigious and his-toric institutions is so contentious that Florida and Georgia can’t even agree on when it ofﬁ  cially began. 
  The Bulldogs say 1904, while the 
Gators say 1915. 
  For Muschamp, it started in 1991, 
when he enrolled at Georgia to play safety. 
  For four straight seasons, Mus-
champ’s Bulldogs lost to Spurrier’s Gators. 
  A boy who grew up in Gainesville 
cheering for Florida became a man during those four years at Georgia. 
  Now, 20 years later, he is the 
head coach of the team he rooted for as a child and despised, at least by association, as a young adult. En-tering his ﬁ  rst game against his old team, Muschamp says none of that matters. 
  “I know there will be a lot of 
wasted ink on the fact that I played at Georgia and now I’m coaching at Florida, but this is not the ﬁ  rst time that I have coached against Geor-gia,” he said Monday. 
  “Wherever I played has no bear-
ing on this game at all. Every game is important; they’re all important games. It’s a SEC East opponent, it’s a big rival, it’s important to the Uni-versity of Florida, so it’s important to me.”
  Others aren’t so sure the game 
won’t mean more to Muschamp. 
  “He won’t know until the game 
is played in my opinion,” Richt said this week. 
  If it does in fact hold a special 
place for him, Muschamp won’t ad-mit it publicly. He’s trying to build a reputation as a tactician, focusing on preparation and technique rather than motivation and emotion. 
  But even Muschamp had to ad-
mit that Saturday’s showdown is unique. 
  “There’s no question that there’s 
a little more juice involved in the game,” Muschamp said. “This is one of the great rivalries in all of sports.”
    
  All the hype, all the buildup mani-
fests on the bus ride in.
  Frankie Hammond, a junior wide 
receiver, had been told about coming 
across the Hart Bridge in Jacksonville, looking down and seeing the metropo-lis of RVs, the sea of red and black and orange and blue.
  Still, he said, “Until you experience 
it yourself, you don’t really know what to expect.”
  The gathering of two fan bases in 
one place, the view from above, it’s a spectacle. 
  “You get charged when you come 
over that bridge, and you see all the RVs, the passion and the tradition of the game,” Muschamp said. “You get goosebumps talking about it.”
  But stepping off the bus, the pag-
eantry dissolves, and all that’s left is the game to be played, the history to be made. 
  There’s a new coach etching his 
name into the books this year, and al-though he takes a different approach than those who came before him, some things never change.
  As Georgia  idefensive back Sanders 
Commings put it: “We don’t like them, and they don’t like us.”

The play that started it all: Running back Knowshon Moreno (24) leaps into the end zone early in the ﬁ  rst quarter of the 2007 meeting between Florida 
and Georgia in Jacksonville. Immediately after, the Bulldogs stormed the ﬁ  eld in celebration, causing two unsportsmanlike penalties to be thrown.

In one of the more memorable moments in the history of the rivalry, Georgia cleared its bench in celebration of 
a ﬁ  rst-quarter touchdown in the 2007 meeting, which the Bulldogs went on to win 42-30.

  EMILY MORROW

  Wendy Ruiz was born and raised in Miami. 
  She has a Florida driver’s license and is regis-
tered to vote in Florida. 
  She graduated from high school in Miami 
and decided to go to Miami Dade College to be-come a podiatrist. 
  It was then she found out that in the eyes of 
the state’s public university system, she is not a Florida resident. 
  Because Ruiz is a dependent student whose 
parents are illegal immigrants, she is not eligible for in-state tuition.
  The cost of in-state tuition and fees at Miami-
Dade is about $2,500 a year. For out-of-state stu-dents, it’s about $9,000.
  At UF, tuition and fees are $5,700 a year for 
in-state students and roughly $28,000 for out-of-state students.
  Last week, the Southern Poverty Law Cen-
ter, a nonproﬁ  t civil rights organization based in Montgomery, Ala., ﬁ  led a class-action law-suit on behalf of Ruiz and several other students who will challenge the guidelines for determin-ing Florida residency.  “These are U.S. citizens who are being dis-
criminated against,” said Jerri Katzerman, direc-tor of educational advocacy for the center. “A generation of young people are having to forgo or postpone their education because of this is-sue.” 
  Virginia has similar in-state tuition restric-
tions.
  California has the largest estimated illegal 
immigrant population in the United States with about 2.6 million, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. However, illegal immigrants who grad-uate from California high schools are eligible for in-state tuition.
  Florida has the third-largest population, with 
an estimated 675,000 illegal immigrants.
  Their U.S.-born children are often ﬁ  rst-gener-
ation college students, Katzerman said.
  Many of these students, like Ruiz, are forced 
to enroll part time or take on multiple jobs to af-ford the higher tuition, she said.
  Calling the policy “unconstitutional,” the 
center is bringing the charges against the Flor-ida Department of Education and the Board of Governors, demanding the removal of the pro-vision requiring a student’s parents’ proof of  Students denied in-state tuition

  The Princeton Review named UF the na-
tion’s No. 1 Jock School as part of the company’s 
annual college rankings and ratings.
  The list is determined by an online student 
survey , said David Soto, director of college rankings and ratings.
  UF was the only SEC school in the top 10, al-
though Florida State University came in at No. 10, and Auburn University was ranked No. 11.
  Ido Zaken, 19, building construction fresh-
man, plays intramural basketball and ﬂ  ag foot-ball for his fraternity, Tau Epsilon Phi. He said he sees a lot of multicultural groups with teams, too.   
  Soto said he doesn’t see the label as a bad 
thing for UF.
  “I think using these lists in conjunction with 
each other is the best way to shop for the right college,” he said.
  Schools that scored at the bottom of the list were then ranked at the top of the “Dodgeball Target” list, Soto said. 
  Those included New College at No. 1, New 
York University at No. 9 and Rollins College at No. 15.
  For the 2011 lists, about 122,000 students 
from the 376 surveyed schools responded. 
  Soto said of the 80 questions on the survey , 
three were used to determine a school’s “jock” status. 
Students were asked to separately rate the 
popularity of intercollegiate sports, intramural sports, and fraternities and sororities on a one-to-ﬁ  ve scale of very low to very high popular-ity.  UF takes ﬁ  rst place on list of 
country’s top ‘jock schools’

� HE SENT A MEMO TO 
GOV. RICK SCOTT.
  JOEY FLECHAS
 Alligator Staff Writer
  UF President Bernie Machen 
has made a few suggestions to 
Gov. Rick Scott about how ad-dress accountability at UF.
  Machen sent a memo to 
Scott in September, shared with administrators Thursday , that outlined some of Machen’s ideas.
  Among those ideas, he sug-
gested using the number of UF businesses that spin off and the number of graduates in science, technology , engineering and math to measure achievement among national peers.
  “My goal was to provide 
some essential information and begin a dialogue with the governor’s ofﬁ  ce on this topic,” Machen wrote.
  The memo was released this 
week by the governor’s ofﬁ  ce after a public records request.
  Machen mentioned pro-
posals heralded by Texas Gov . Rick Perry, which include em-phasizing student evaluations when assessing teachers perfor-mance. He wrote that aspects of the plan are already being used in UF’s teaching evaluations.
  “Teaching is evaluated an-
nually using student and peer input,” he wrote, “and evidence of good teaching is required for tenure and promotion.”  Machen addresses

  Three little pigs ran ahead of 
their parents toward the pirate ship, 
Alpha Delta Pi’s decorated house.
  The children, dressed in Hal-
loween costumes, attended Ghouls, Goblins and Greeks, an annual event held on Sorority Row on Thursday. 
  The 16 Panhellenic sororities 
decorated their houses using themes for children of all ages to come trick-or-treat in a safe environment. About 800 people attended.
  “It’s a great idea for the Greeks 
to kick this off for our kids,” said Tara Andirson, mother of two of the little pigs. “It’s safer than just going door to door, and it’s not just collecting candy; there are games for the kids to play.”
  First-year members of the soror-
ities created and operated all of the decorations, costumes and games.
  “We want our new members to be philanthropic, and through events like this, we’re instilling those values in them now,” said Emily Burris, 20, director of Junior Panhellenic.
  The most signiﬁ  cant change 
to the event this year was that the ﬁ  ve houses not on Sorority Row got space to decorate on Norman Field. Last year, all ﬁ  ve houses were given only a few feet of space in the Soror-ity Row parking lot.
  The change was made to give 
the off-row houses a better chance to compete with the other houses in the traditional theme contest.
  “All the houses are really festive 
with great themes, and the kids are loving it,” said contest judge Brit-tany Banta, 21, a nursing senior.  “We’re really impressed, and it’s going to be hard to decide on a win-ner.” 
  The houses were judged based 
on ﬁ  ve criteria: banner, costumes, games, theme and spirit. 
  Sigma Kappa’s theme was 
“Scooby Doo and Sigma Kappa Too!” Sorority members dressed as characters from the cartoon. Kids recognized Daphne, Shaggy, Fred and the others. They begged for pictures while fog machines cre-ated a creepy atmosphere.
  “Scooby Doo is a theme that 
boys and girls of all ages can relate to,” said Chelsea Lutz, an 18-year-old anthropology and history soph-omore.
  According to the judges, she was 
right on all counts. 
Sigma Kappa won the “Best All 
Around” award.
  “I won the bean toss there,” said 
7-year-old Grifﬁ  n, smiling down at his bag stuffed with candy.

Megan Smith was tied to a chair screaming for help in the 
Broward Hall basement on Thursday night. 
Her screams could be heard echoing into the Broward lob-
by as students and community members attended the fifth-
annual Haunted Broward, advertised as the largest haunted house on campus. 
Smith, 18, an animal sciences freshman, was one of the ac-
tors this year. She credits her mom with her interest in creepy things. 
“She got me into a lot of horror stuff,” Smith said.This year’s theme was the horror movie franchise Saw.Organizers received about $465 for the event, said Nicole 
La Hoz, 20, a publicity director for the event and a journalism junior.
The Inter-Residence Hall Association provided about $265. 
Rawlings Area Council and Broward Area Council provided about $200.
The house was created with 90 pounds of tarp, fake body 
parts, about 30 Jigsaw masks and red paint, La Hoz said.
At the beginning of the haunted maze, people walked to 
the Broward basement to watch a 40-second video. Jigsaw, a masked character from Saw, said: “Welcome to Broward. Get ready to play a game.”
Tour guides then led the groups through a maze of black 
tarps that concealed actors with Jigsaw and Pigman masks waiting to jump out at any moment. 
Some of the scenes recreated by the actors included a scene 
from “Saw I” where a man saws off his foot and a scene from “Saw IV” where a woman’s hair is pulled by a winch. 
People then traveled through a maintenance tunnel that 
had black trash bags hanging from the ceiling. Fake body parts protruded from the bags.
After a final scare from an actor in a Jigsaw mask, they 
were released from Broward and back into the night. 
Korie Padgett, an 18-year-old psychology freshman, at-
tended the event with some of her friends. 
“I had my eyes closed the whole time,” Padgett said. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

38% NOToday’s question: Do you consider UF a jock school?
Thursday’s question: Will you have 
to pay off student loans after you          graduate?Halloween is the best holiday ever. No family, no an-
noying caroling and no fruitcake. Plus, you get to dress up 
as your favorite superhero, villain or monster and, for the ladies, any sexy “insert profession here.” 
Oh yeah, there’s candy, too.But a common feature of Halloween is often left out. 
When kids say “trick or treat,” rarely are they treated with a trick. This brings us to our scare-some-kids-and-keep-the-candy-for-yourself edition of... 
Darts and Laurels
Halloween is all about having a good costume. That’s 
why we’re throwing a don’t-be-so-uptight DART to Ohio 
University’s Students Teaching About Racism in Society  
for their “We’re a culture, not a costume” ad campaign. Yes, sometimes costumes can go too far, but stereotypes have always been a subject of comedy. 
If we can’t laugh at ourselves, can we really laugh at 
anything else? 
Thanks to the recipient of our next award, we hope we 
can keep the kids safe on Halloween. That’s why we’re giv-ing a pissing-off-the-perverts LAUREL to Anonymous for 
bringing down about 40 child pornography websites and releasing the usernames of the creepy, screwed-up people who use them. 
Next, we throw a way-to-spoil-the-Halloween-fun 
DART to Boca Raton for threatening to fine Rick Newman, 
who usually goes all out for Halloween, $1,000 if children perform a rendition of Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” in front of his house. The city argues that advertising this perfor -
mance constitutes as commercial activity and has no place in a residential neighborhood. Thirty dancers, aged 7 to 18, have been practicing for the past six months for this perfor -
mance. But, you’re right Boca Raton. You know best! 
In other news, we give a 2008-doesn’t-look-so-bad-now 
LAUREL to Hillary Clinton for doing better than Presi-
dent Obama in the latest Time magazine head-to-head polls against GOP candidates. Clinton royally punishes Mitt Romney at 55 to 38 percent. It’s not too late to throw your hat in the race. 
We give our final do-you-not-have-better-things-to-do-
with-your-time DART to The New York Times for send-
ing a cease-and-desist letter to the Huffington Post over a “trademark” infringement. The Times apparently has a blog on its website called “Motherlode.” Huffington Post created a blog called “Parentlode.” If the Times wanted to prevent people from drawing inspiration from its website, they would be shutting down websites all over the Inter -
net. Chill out! 
Finally, we present a representing-the-vertically-chal-
lenged-everywhere LAUREL to Jayson Carter, a 4-foot-9 
walk-on of Rice University’s football team. Go get ‘em, man! 
Have a fun and safe Halloween weekend, and  be sure 
to check back next week! Foreign students can benefit work force
Now more than ever, Americans have been ques-
tioning the importation of foreign labor. With the illegal immigration issue heating up, conversa-
tions of ethics, morals and rationale have mixed together to form a complex debate.
America’s geopolitical landscape has shifted signifi-
cantly, and our status as one of the key players on the international stage is threatened. Maybe we’re not quite ready to admit to our slow loss of international control, but we can’t get caught lagging behind. 
Recently, the Senate has proposed a bill that will in-
crease the yearly cap on H-1B work visas. The most sub-stantial part of the bill is the category that would lead to an automatic green card for any foreign student who earns a master’s degree in engineering or the physical sciences at a U.S. university. Essentially, we are inviting foreign stu-dents to join our academic institutions without having to worry about a complex green card process. 
Of course, any foreign student who is accepted into an 
American university is the best of the best. These students would bolster our country’s competitive drive, make our companies profitable and provide valuable knowledge to improve our existing foundations. Despite these clear advantages, many people strongly oppose the welcoming of highly skilled and qualified foreign students into this country.
The argument is that foreign entrepreneurs pose a 
threat to American engineers and other programmers who fear being replaced. With a faltering economy and scarcity in the job market, such apprehension is justified. Howev-er, for how much longer can we fixate on individualistic needs? While we certainly want to boast and emphasize American intelligence, we can’t forget that America as a whole is falling behind, especially in the education sector. We simply aren’t breeding highly qualified students who can take on the tasks that a technical job market demands. We must fight these concerns broadly, through a macro-level perspective.
The goal of the H-1B bill isn’t to deprive Americans of 
job opportunities. In fact, many foreign students perform tasks that American students are unwilling to do, usually because the stipend is too low. But for foreign students coming from impoverished countries, the in-centives in America are dreams come true. Not to mention, for-eign students come here to help nourish American institutions with their talent and skill sets. 
Furthermore, H-1Bs do not pose a financial threat to 
American employees. Academic and government studies have demonstrated that foreign employees are often paid less than American employees. The sad truth is that the real motive behind the H-1B bill is not to help foreigners prosper but to exploit them for cheap labor. America needs foreign students and employees in order to excel. 
Just because our job market is suffering today doesn’t 
mean we should prevent foreigners from coming to our country, especially when they can help us achieve far-reaching goals. The H-1B bill will initiate efforts to bring in the workforce that we need. 
Moreover, by providing green cards to foreign entre-
preneurs, US companies will no longer have to address the concerns of foreign-born workers who are often stuck in the middle of a messy and complicated immigration sys-tem.   Specifically, their reliance on foreigners stems from the fact that American schools are simply not producing the caliber of students that tech industries demand. 
For many years now, immigrants have traveled to our 
country to build their dreams with relentless stamina. In turn, U.S. tech companies have only excelled through the contribution of foreigners who bring innovative and cre-ative ideas to the table — ideas that are simply not bred through American education. The H-1B bill will make our economy stronger, and it will challenge the stakeholders to produce domestic workers who are as competent as the foreign ones.

Shaq paid too much
Imagine $70,000 in cash. 
Picture 70,000 $1 bills stacked 
high, or 7,000 $10 bills or 700 $100 bills. However you want to look at it, it’s a lot of money.
And now imagine your uni-
versity. Think about your class-rooms, your programs, your professors, your equipment, etc. Now think of any problems or shortcomings that $70,000 in cash would help in some way to alleviate. Pretty easy to do, right?
Well, $70,000 is how much 
Accent thought it was appropri-ate to spend to have a famous NBA basketball player come and entertain 3,200 people at the O’Connell Center on Tues-day night for an hour or so. Was it really worth it? Did he really have anything to say that was worth $70,000? Oh, and you are aware, of course, that he is already an extremely wealthy man, right?
You have got to be kidding me — $70,000! 
OK, sure, he might inspire 
people with his life story and his achievements on the bas-ketball court, but that inspira-tion can be derived from him without actually seeing him in person.
About six to seven years ago, 
Bill Clinton came to speak, and the building was filled to capac-ity . Many people were turned away at the door. His two-hour speech was electrifying, inspi-rational and informative in so many ways. It was even re-played later on the radio. That felt worth it to the community . 
I hope that you will en-
courage Accent to spend your  money more wisely and bring in people who are truly “speak-ers” and have a message that is meaningful to more people than just a few starstruck sports fans.

Letters to the Editor
On Tuesday, an anti-choice group came to cam-pus. Members were offering DVDs with a cryptic “180” logo on their cases, the contents of which 
were not in any way mysterious or new. The film pre-sented itself as a documentary, interviewing people on the street about their views on abortion. 
There are almost as many viewpoints on abortion 
as there are people. While I reject the idea that another person should be able to take away my right to have an abortion, I respect those people who would not have an abortion themselves.
However, this film takes a quick turn for the bizarre 
— the interviewees are asked if they have ever heard of Hitler.
If you remember the so-called “Genocide Awareness 
Project” that set up shop on campus a few years ago, you may recall grotesque images and insulting signs proclaiming that legal abortion was tantamount to the Holocaust. You might remember how these signs did not respect your intelligence and bombarded you with misinformation in the hopes that you would make a snap judgment about an important issue based on emo-tion alone.
This film sets up an illogical argument where the 
right to a safe, legal abortion and the unfathomable hu-man tragedy of the Holocaust are portrayed as one and the same. In the film, those who speak positively about the right to abortion are associated with neo-Nazis and other infuriating people.Not only are these claims 
absurd, but they are also of-fensive to survivors of the Holocaust and their descen-dants. It is also offensive to 
the 70,000 women a year who die worldwide after being forced to seek out unsafe, illegal abortions in countries where the procedure is not legally allowed.Abortion is at least 10 times safer than childbirth. Despite efforts to make abortion appear more dangerous by associating it with breast cancer, sterility and mental health issues, re-peated studies have shown that these claims do not hold up to scientific scrutiny.
Having worked with Planned Parenthood and wom-
en’s health clinics locally and nationally, I can tell you that the decision to have an abortion is not taken lightly . The women who cross a line of shouting protesters to access a service allowed to them by law have not made a snap decision. 
Once they arrive at the clinic, they are still counseled 
on all of their options, including bringing the fetus to term, adoption and abortion. Should they decide to have an abortion, they are carefully exercising their right to choose. They have that freedom because our nation trusts women to make their own decisions about their own bodies.
I don’t know about you, but I think that this right falls 
under the heading of “unalienable.”

� KRISHNA LUNCH AT UF HAS 
BEEN SERVED FOR 40 YEARS.
JULIA GLUM
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Krishna community will 
commemorate the 40th anniversa-
ry of Krishna Lunch at UF tonight with a tribute to Beatles member George Harrison, who introduced many to the culture. 
Here Comes the Sun, a musical 
and spiritual tribute to Harrison, debuts at 8 p.m. in University Au-ditorium.
“We thought this would be 
a nice way to broaden people’s understanding of the Krishna movement and something people would enjoy,” said Carl Woodham, chaplain of Gainesville’s Krishna House.The Krishna House will serve a 
free hot dinner for ticket holders on the Plaza of the Americas from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Woodham ex-pects 400 to 600 people to attend.
Harrison biographer Joshua 
Greene will host the multimedia presentation of photos and video clips as the Godfrey Townsend Band plays 18 of Harrison’s songs. Special guest Bada Haridas will perform Indian devotional music. 
When Hare Krishna founder Sri-
la Prabhupada visited Gainesville in 1971, he suggested Krishna fol-lowers serve food to locals. Since then, Krishna House has served vegetarian and vegan dishes to about 800 people five days a week. Each meal requires a $4 donation.
Tickets range from $10 to $25, 
depending on seat location. Stu-dents can purchase seats today at Krishna Lunch.Krishna Lunch celebrates

UF has altered plans to expand its dental school 
and will work with two Florida universities that 
had planned to build their own dental schools. 
Florida A&M University , which originally 
requested funds from the state to open its own dental school, will now work with UF to funnel students into UF’s dental program, said Karen Rhodenizer, communications director for the Col-lege of Dentistry. 
The University of Central Florida is still going 
ahead with plans to open its own dental school. If its proposal is approved, UF will provide the school with consulting services, such as help with curriculum development, Rhodenizer said.
Initial plans for the College of Dentistry to ex-
pand by 80 students and to renovate the 40-year-old dental science building were announced at the Sept. 14 Board of Governors meeting. 
The new proposal seeks to expand by 48 stu-
dents over four years, or 12 students per year. 
UF and FAMU have submitted one proposal together to the Board of Governors. UCF will sub-mit its own proposal. 
Rhodenizer said the board is expected to vote 
on the proposals during its meeting on November 9 and 10.
UF and FAMU’s proposal requests $2.2 mil-
lion for renovations to the dental science building, a $1 million decrease from the first proposal. 
The program would require $5.9 million in 
recurring funds by its fourth year.  
UF has tried to secure fund-
ing to expand its dental school for several years, Rhodenizer said. Lately , there has been a renewed focus in Florida on improving access to dental care. 
She said the idea of increas-
ing class size in dental programs has much to do with bringing dentists into under-served areas. 
“There are entire counties with no dentists that 
will accept patients with Medicaid,” she said. 
The partnership with FAMU also seeks to in-
crease diversity in the field of dentistry, a profes-sion that historically hasn’t attracted minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, Rho-denizer said. 
FAMU may revisit the idea of opening a dental 
school in the future, she said, but in the current economy, there simply isn’t enough money.UF, FAMU to expand dental programs

� THE GROUP HOPES TO GIVE 
OUT FLIERS IN NOVEMBER.
MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
Catcalling and other acts of sexual ha-
rassment have been a problem at Santa 
Fe College, and the SFC Student Govern-ment has formed a task force to combat it. 
It hopes to raise awareness about the 
issue in the coming months, but none of the plans have begun yet, said Ashleigh Bennett, SFC’s Student Body vice presi-dent and chairwoman of the task force.
“We want to make our presence 
known,” Bennett said.
She said an SFC professor brought 
the issue to the college’s SG after he saw a group of men hanging around the food court, yelling sexual innuendos and swearing at female students and faculty members.
The task force hopes to start handing 
out fliers and putting up posters by mid-November to spread the word about the consequences of sexual harassment, she said. 
Bennett said she is working with 
members of the college administration to figure out how legal parameters and the college’s policies fit into this situation.
She said it would be up to the college 
and the SFC Police Department to decide whether an offender would be suspend-ed or arrested, and it would depend on the nature of the harassment. 
If someone is sexually harassed, Ben-
nett said, he or she should report the inci-dent to the college police.
“I’m certain the police department 
will be involved. To what extent, I don’t know,” said SFC Police Chief Ed Book. “We take the matter seriously.”SFC student task force will

An 8-year-old boy with leukemia has been 
waiting at Shands for a bone marrow trans-
plant for about 20 months. He just found a match.
“There are kids like this all over the world,” 
said Christie Atchison, a co-coordinator for the Bone Marrow Donor Drive. And she said she’s hoping to find just as many donors.
On Monday and Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 5 
p.m., the Bone Marrow Donor Drive will be swabbing cheeks in three locations on cam-pus: Plaza of the Americas, Turlington Plaza and the Reitz Colonnade.
The swabs will be sent to the Gift of Life 
Bone Marrow Foundation to be analyzed, placed in a database and matched with trans-plant patients, Atchison said.
To register, students must sign a consent 
form, be in good health and be at least 18.
Footprints Buddy and Support Program, 
UF Hillel and Student Government are part-nering to organize the drive for its second year. Footprints is a support program that assigns buddies to children in the oncology , transplant and immunology units of Shands at UF. Most of the children there are waiting for transplants, Atchison said.
The theme for this year’s drive is “Gators 
Go Gold.” Gold is the color for childhood can-cer awareness.
At the drive, a raffle will be held for gift 
cards and other prizes, she said. Proceeds will go to childhood cancer research.Last year, about 500 people were swabbed at the drive. She said this year’s goal is to hit 1,000.
Atchison said people should not be dis-
couraged from registering if they’re afraid of the actual transplant procedure.It’s usually an outpatient procedure, she said. 
“When you donate bone marrow, you’re 
saving a person’s life directly ,” Atchison said. “More than likely , you’re that person’s only chance of living.”Bone-marrow-donor registration

residency.
The Department of Educa-
tion creates rules regarding tuition and residency for the state’s community colleges, and the Board of Governors does the same for state uni-versities.
Both offices declined to 
comment on the case.
Victor Yengle, assistant ex-
ternal director for CHISPAS, a UF student organization com-mitted to fighting for immi-grants’ rights, said he thinks the issue is ”outrageous.”
“It’s a complete attack on 
the minority community,” said Yengle, a 22-year-old eco-nomics junior. 
Of the 50,116 students en-
rolled at UF in Fall 2010, 3,957 were considered nonresi-dents.
It is unclear how many of 
those students may be affect-ed by this lawsuit. 
To be considered a Florida 
resident, a student must ei-ther be independent and have lived in Florida for a year or be a dependent whose par -
ents or guardians have lived in Florida for at least a year. Students who do not meet 
one of these residency re-quirements must fill out a nonresident form, lumping them with out-of-state and foreign applicants.
Yengle said he thinks the 
restrictions on qualifications for in-state tuition reflect poor economic decisions by the state.
Florida, he said, could 
only benefit from allowing more students to go to school and be competitive for high-
paying jobs. Especially b e c a u s e some of the students af-fected by 
this provi-sion choose not to pur -
sue higher 
education at all, costing the state tuition money, he said.
“These kids are going to 
be contributing members of society,” he said. “They will get jobs, earn wages and pay taxes. Why wouldn’t you en-able them to go to school?” 
UF spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes said the university could not comment on the issue due to the pending litigation.10, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2011
The group does not currently have 
permission to serve food on campus
consuming animal fat in the form of 
milk, butter, yogurt and other cow milk products, Bogle wrote in an email. 
The group has not settled on a final 
location or specific serving days, but it plans to continue distributing food.  
Bogle said volunteers were wel-comed by students and some fac-ulty. Women’s studies sophomore 
Marla Munro, 19, saw the Vegetar -
ian Theological Society on Mon-day on Plaza of the Americas. She doesn’t think the society will last. 
“I do not think any other group 
could ever compete with Krishna Lunch even if they tried,” she said. 
The Office of the Vice President 
for Business Affairs, which gives off-campus vendors permission to serve on campus, got word of the new society on Wednesday.“Because they are distributing 
on UF’s campus, they have to get permission from the vice president’s office, and they have not gotten it,” said Cheryl Wise, an administrative assistant in the office. 
Krishna House volunteers 
and staff members can serve Krishna Lunch because they ac-cept a $4 donation for each meal.  The Office of the Vice President for Business Affairs is currently looking into the new society.

Ah, yes. It’s that time of year 
again. 
You know, the time when 
the leaves begin to turn (at least up north), jack-o’-lanterns fill the streets and thousands upon thousands of Florida and Georgia students flock to Jacksonville for the World’s Larg-est Outdoor Cocktail Party and some football game that supposedly takes place.
While we here at the alligator -
Sports Brand Picks Column don’t condone binge drinking — or wear -
ing jorts, for that matter — after a weekend of not having to work, we long for the chance to kick back, enjoy some hard drinks and watch some football at the Landing.
So while we will be enjoying this 
weekend’s game from the sober con-fines of the press box, we let two of our columnists who are drunk with differing rage over the Suck for Luck phenomenon debate one of this weekend’s marquee matchups.
Stanford (-7.5) will help Andrew 
Luck continue his quest to become a Miami Dolphin because ...
Speaking of consuming copious 
amounts of alcohol, Luck isn’t trying to mess up his stake as the top pick in next season’s NFL Draft, when he will be packing up his life and taking his talents to South Beach. 
Luck and the Cardinal have been 
on a tear this year, and that won’t change against some Hollywood team down the road on Interstate 5. Luck has been methodical this sea-son, even calling his own plays at times. And Stanford seems like the one non-SEC team that can match the physicality of LSU or Bama. Did I mention Luck calls his own plays?
The future Hall of Fame quarter -
back is going to keep up his glorious campaign, kinda like the Dolphins are going to stay strong in their own Picks

Florida’s ground game has struggled when defenses have stacked the box, but running back Chris 
Rainey expects the lanes to open up against Georgia with the return of quarterback John Brantley.  
KELLY PRICE
Alligator Writer
 
LAND O’LAKES  — The 6-foot-5, 
215-pound son of a former Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers offensive tackle tries very hard to keep his secrets.
Kent Taylor, rated the No. 1 tight end 
in the nation by Rivals.com, walked into the lobby of the Land O’Lakes High gym wearing red and black, an ambiguous color choice given his offers from FSU, Georgia and Alabama. 
He had waited nearly a month, keep-
ing his decision under wraps until the Thursday afternoon ceremony present-ing him with his U.S. Army All-Ameri-
can Bowl jersey. 
He said only a few 
close friends and family 
members knew his final decision.
Taylor has hung 
out in Nick Saban’s of-fice and Joe Paterno’s house. His final choices 
included college football’s No. 1- and No. 2-ranked schools in LSU and Ala-bama, respectively. 
His principal even said the ceremo-ny was “one of the most important an-nouncements in Land O’Lakes High School’s history.”
So after Taylor slipped on the black-
and-gold All-American jersey, he stepped up to the podium, visibly anxious. He thanked his loved ones and talked grate-fully about his final six choices: LSU, Alabama, Penn State, Georgia, FSU and Florida. 
“But I do want to tell you guys this,” 
he started. “Once a Gator – “
He stopped, reaching for a Phila-
delphia Phillies drawstring backpack, No. 1 tight end recruit commits to Florida TYLER JETT

Of all the players who pave the 
way for Chris Rainey, the most 
important is also the skinniest.
Florida’s offensive line weighs 
an average of 300.7 pounds; quar -
terback John Brantley weighs 219 pounds. But without the redshirt senior, the Gators’ big men have carried too heavy a burden. 
Opposing defenses have load-
ed the box this month, challeng-ing Florida and its rotation of freshman quarterbacks to throw the ball. The Gators have failed to air it out, only adding to the pressure. 
For Rainey, the running lanes 
that once looked so wide have narrowed significantly. He ex-pects that to change Saturday, when the Gators (4-3, 2-3 South-eastern Conference) take on the No. 22 Bulldogs (5-2, 4-1 SEC) in Jacksonville.
In particular, Rainey thinks 
Georgia’s defense won’t be able to load the box like Alabama, LSU and Auburn did in Florida’s three losses.
“It will definitely open up a 
lot, definitely” he said. “You’ll see a lot of change in the defense if (Brantley) comes back.”

Center Azania Stewart (13) said UF’s post players 
can build on last year’s strong rebounding effort. 
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Writer
 
Tennessee was the only Southeastern 
Conference team to grab more rebounds 
than Florida last season.
However, the Volunteers were not 
the only squad that finished ahead of the Gators in the final conference standings, as Florida finished eighth in the league during the 2010-11 season.
While the Gators’ effort in the paint 
was solid, senior center Azania Stewart believes her position group can do more to win games this season.
“(We want to) just dominate,” Stew-
art said. “After a game’s finished, (we want) to say that we overplayed our op-ponent.”
In terms of crashing the boards, Flori-
da was dominant at times last season.
In addition to ranking second in 
the SEC with 1,432 total rebounds, the Gators also trailed only the Volunteers with a plus-4.4 rebounding margin and 4.5 blocks per game.
Spearheading those efforts was Stew-
art, who led UF with 6.1 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per contest.
“Azania is someone — even as a 
freshman — that we’ve relied on to be someone who is solid, someone who’s consistent,” Florida coach Amanda But-ler said. “She wants to be a lot more than just the reliable player or the good de-fender — she really wants to be an im-pact player.”
At SEC Media Day on Thursday in 
Hoover, Ala., Butler said strong post play was “essential” to her team’s suc-cess this season.
However, it will take more than just Stewart to achieve that.
One player that will have to assume 
an increased role is junior forward Jen-nifer George.
George’s second year in Gainesville 
saw her rank second on the team with 5.6 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game coming off the bench.
“She’s never really taken that respon-
sibility before,” senior guard Jordan Jones said. “She’s never demanded the ball, she’s never said, ‘Hey, I’m open — give it to me.’”
However, Jones said that George has 
become more vocal this offseason, letting the guards know when they miss her on scoring opportunities in practice.
Florida was predicted to finish sixth 
in the preseason SEC media poll, trailing Tennessee, Georgia, Kentucky, LSU and Vanderbilt.
In order to exceed those expectations, 
the Gators will have to maintain their rebounding prowess while upping the ante offensively.
“The teams that dominate the paint,” 
Butler said, “are generally going to be successful.” Gators looking to dominate down low in 2011
“(We want to) just dominate.  
After a game’s finished, (we 
want) to say that we overplayed 
our opponent.”
Azania Stewart 
UF centerButler says post play ‘essential’which he struggled opening 
for about 20 seconds.
“Uh,” he stuttered awk-
wardly. “Hold on.”
“— always a Gator.” He threw on an orange-
and-blue hat, finally making his decision public.
Earlier this month, when 
Taylor called UF tight ends coach Derek Lewis to inform the staff of his decision, he said all the coaches were in a meeting room.
“When I committed, they 
really went crazy,” Taylor said.
His oral commitment is 
significant for Florida, which just had sophomore tight end Gerald Christian announce his transfer. Taylor is also the 17th overall oral commit in coach Will Muschamp’s first full class.
“I wanted to play football 
since I knew what football was,” Taylor said. “My dad played for the Bucs, and I’ve always wanted to do it. So now that I’ve lived through (that) and I get to go to Flori-da … it’s absolutely a dream come true.”
But the biggest determin-
ing factor, Taylor repeated several times, was the prom-ise of playing time in the new offense. 
“Past history has shown 
that the offensive coordina-tor, Charlie Weis, is going to throw to tight ends,” he said.
“It depends how ready I 
am and how big I get. They kind of said as a freshman, (I’ll be) just kind of catching balls and growing into that every-down blocker.”
Next on Taylor’s sched-
ule: “absolutely got to recruit recruits.” 
He said he is currently 
talking to Tampa Berkeley Prep five-star athlete Nelson Agholor, the nation’s No. 11 overall recruit, and St. Petersburg Lakewood High five-star defensive end Dante Fowler, Jr., who is currently a soft oral commit for FSU.
Oral commitments are non-
binding until a national letter of intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 1, 2012.Brantley suffered a high ankle 
sprain against Alabama on Oct. 1, Rainey has squeaked out 92 yards on 35 carries. Before Brantley’s injury, Rainey gained 408 yards on 68 carries — more than twice as many yards per touch. 
That has been the case for all 
of Florida’s running backs. The Gators have averaged 2.7 yards per carry since Brantley’s injury compared to 5.4 yards per carry before he went down. 
Florida hasn’t even been at full 
strength in the backfield. Senior Jeff Demps (ankle) didn’t dress against Auburn and only touched the ball twice against LSU. 
Junior Mike Gillislee, mean-
while, flashed potential against LSU, but only received three car -
ries the next week, with coach Will Muschamp later saying Gil-
lislee had s u f f e r e d an undis-closed in-jury.
Before the season, coordinator 
Charlie Weis talked about how excited he was to use Rainey and Demps as much as possible — they would be exhausted at the end of every game, he said.
The team’s blueprint for 
success was to run the offense through its two fastest players, but neither back is big enough to carry the load against a stacked box. 
And with Brantley out, Flori-
da was playing with a hand tied behind its back.
Opposing defenses had no rea-
son not to key on the run. When the Gators went to the air, they rarely succeeded. Quarterbacks Jacoby Brissett and Jeff Driskel averaged a combined 4.8 yards per attempt, about half as many yards as Florida averaged with Brantley passing.
Asked if Florida’s inability 
to throw the ball made the of-fensive line’s job more difficult,  sophomore guard Kyle Koehne said two weeks ago that it didn’t. Simply put, Koehne and his fel-low guards had to do their jobs. That’s it.
Rainey said something similar 
this week. 
While he admitted running against a loaded box is difficult, the redshirt senior said Florida’s offensive line could still succeed in those situations.
How?“Beat the man in front of you,” 
Rainey said. “Just keep pounding the ball.”
This week, Florida will have 
one extra body helping make the push. A 219-pound push.

— TOM GREEN
USC (+7.5) will show that Luck isn’t the only quarterback 
who’s for real because…
Matt Barkley is here to comfort all the believers. 
Luck may be the best quarterback in college football, but no 
man is a lock to succeed in the NFL. And, by the same token, no one is good enough to win a game on his own. 
All Stanford has done this season is beat teams it was sup-
posed to beat. The Cardinal hasn’t played anyone nearly as good as USC, nor has it played in an environment anything like the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
Barkley has all the talent in the world, and will be a fine con-
solation prize when my beloved ‘Phins finish 4-12, leaving the Rams and Colts to battle it out for that coveted No. 1 spot.
Plus, with Robert Woods making plays at wideout, the Tro-
jans have the more potent passing game in the here and now, regardless of Luck’s “Hall of Fame” future. 
Fight on, USC!
— GREG LUCA
Now, on to the picks!
In first place with a 40-23 record is the Associated Press’ 
Mark “What’s this button do, cutie?” Long, who feigned inter -
est in a rival service’s latest media equipment for a chance to 
flirt with some college girls. Time to grow up and give up on your dreams, old man. In second with a 36-27 record is alligatorSports writer Greg 
“I seriously hate Jeff Foxworthy” Luca, whose disdain for those with maroon-colored collars continued this week when he said, if given the choice, he’d rather eliminate all “hicks” than fix the flawed U.S. government. This is why we can’t have nice things, Greg.
Leading a tie for third with a 35-28 record is alligatorSports 
writer Tyler “16 is the new 18” Jett, whose questioning about a certain coworker’s younger sister not only raised flags in the office, but may have landed Tyler on some FBI watch-lists. Please come in, Tyler, Chris Hansen would like you to have a seat over there.
Knotted with Tyler is alligatorSports assistant editor Matt 
“The world’s second-largest outdoor cocktail party” Watts, who skipped work Monday to go to Jacksonville and watch his Jaguars. Upon waking from his drunken stupor, Watts whined that the game didn’t get enough play on SportsCenter. Sorry the Jags’ rise from “sucktastic” to “pretty damn bad” isn’t more important than the World Series, bud. 
Making a climb from the cellar and now in fifth with a 34-29 
record is the Jacksonville Times-Union’s Mike “I’m still just one of the guys” DiRocco, who tried to keep his jump to ESPN’s evil empire a secret. Mike really hated covering Florida, so he decided the best course of action was to do it more often and for a bigger organization. And, yes, Mike, the rest of us do re-sent you for it. 
Tied with Mike is FightinGators.com’s Cody “What’s in a name?” Jones, who is hell-bent on bestowing his first child (as-suming someone is down to procreate with him) with the, um, unique name “Smoltzy.” Really, Cody?  Long live the under -
achieving 90s-era Braves!
Dropping to seventh with a 32-31 record is InsideTheGa-
tors.com’s Kyle “Let’s all hold hands” Maistri, who believes in a utopian society where money doesn’t exist and iPads are passed out like Halloween candy . Put down the peace pipe, Kyle.
And yet again in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor 31-
32 record is alligatorSports editor Tom “Teacups and Turkey Legs” Green, whose wild ride on the bye week was piloted by none other than Mr. Toad. Word is Tom met up with his Snow White while touring the Magic Kingdom with his family , only she didn’t awake from his kiss; she vomited.20, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2011

 Chanel Brown looked around 
and saw a quiet locker room.
  “Our team hates to lose,” she said. 
“We deﬁ  nitely grew from that.”
  The moment took place more 
than one month ago in the O’Connell 
Center, the last time Florida’s volley-ball team lost a game. 
  Tonight, Knoxville, Tenn., will 
play host to a rematch against Ten-nessee (18-3, 11-1 Southeastern Con-ference), an opportunity for Florida (17-3, 10-1 SEC) to avenge its only conference loss of the year. 
  “Each day we kind of use that 
game to propel us forward,” junior Tangerine Wiggs said. “We’re really excited to go out Friday and see how a lot of the things we’ve worked on have improved.”
  But what exactly it is the No. 13 
Gators have improved upon since a ﬁ  ve-set loss to the No. 20 V ols is cause for discussion. 
  Wiggs credits the turnaround 
that has resulted in a 24-set winning streak to a renewed focus through-out matches. UF coach Mary Wise hopes her team has a better under-standing that it has to be mistake-free to beat Tennessee.
  “It was a major disappointment, 
but they understood Tennessee out-played us,” Wise said. “When you play against a very talented team, the margin of error is very small.”
  The difference between this 
match and the previous eight could also simply be a gap in competition.
  During its streak, Florida has 
only played two games against teams with winning records in the SEC. The other six opponents have sported a combined record of 20-51 in conference play.
Florida’s two weekend oppo-
nents are a combined 19-1 at home this season.
  “Some mistakes that we could 
get away with against a lesser qual-ity opponent, we could do it,” Wise said. “But against the likes of either Tennessee or Kentucky, there’s just no room for error, especially at the end of close sets.”
  After losing a ﬁ  fth set that saw 
Florida commit four attack errors, questions were raised about the team that had been perfect in the SEC just a year before. 
  “We just kind of sat down and 
talked about ‘What are our goals for the season?’ and ‘What do we really want to accomplish?’” Brown said. “That’s in the past now, and we’ve kind of just rolled on from there.”
  However, that roll will hit its 
steepest challenge this weekend.    
  “What we’re trying to do is see 
how much we’ve improved since the ﬁ  rst time we played these teams and hope that that improvement will be good enough,” Wise said. 3, KICKOFF, ALLIGATOR  FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2011

 The Gators are in a familiar situa-
tion, but a new spot.
  For the third consecutive season, 
No. 18 Florida (14-5, 7-3 Southeast-
ern Conference) and No. 22 South Carolina (14-5, 8-2 SEC) will play for the SEC title in both teams’ regular-season ﬁ  nale.
  Only this time, UF will be the 
team playing for a share of the con-ference title, and South Carolina will be trying to win it outright when the pair square off tonight at 7 at Pressly Stadium.
  The Gators’ recent struggles in 
conference play have put them in the unfamiliar position of being the hunters rather than the hunted.  It is the ﬁ  rst season since the Gators’ streak of ﬁ  ve consecutive SEC ti-tles began in 2006 that they have dropped three conference games.
  Florida is coming off a stretch 
in which it needed an 80th-minute goal to tie last-place Arkansas before pulling it out in overtime, and suf-fered 1-0 losses to Mississippi State and LSU.
  “I’m stunned that we still have 
an opportunity to win the SEC,”  coach Becky Burleigh said. “But I’m excited about it.”
  The two teams’ familiarity with 
each other extends beyond the regu-lar season. While the Gators won the SEC regular-season title in 2009 and 2010 on the ﬁ  nal weekend, the 
two teams also met in the SEC Tournament Fi-nal during both seasons.  Flor-
ida won the most recent matchup, while South Carolina was victorious in 2009.
  Redshirt junior midﬁ  elder McK-
enzie Barney said the Gators are well aware of what they need to do as a team to have success against the Gamecocks.
  “The keys to our success in the 
past have been ﬁ  nishing our oppor-tunities,” Barney said. “Obviously that’s something we need to work on, and if we can do that then hope-fully this game will be in the bag.”
On defense  , Barney said it is 
just as important that Florida limit South Carolina’s scoring chances. Two players Florida will have to focus on are seniors Kayla Grims-ley and Kortney Rhoades.  Grims-ley is tied with Gators junior Erika Tymrak for fourth in the SEC in points with 27, while Rhoades has seven goals and four assists.“Kayla and Kortney are some of the top threats in the SEC, and we have a huge amount of respect for them,” Barney said. “We do have to pay attention to them, but in the same sense, it is 11 v. 11, so we have to fo-cus on everyone.”
  While the stakes are slightly dif-
ferent, Burleigh said the Gators have been preparing for tonight’s game with the same mindset they had for the last two regular-season meetings with the Gamecocks or any other games for that matter.
  “We don’t really do anything 
special against them,” Burleigh said. “We just try to play the way we play .” 
 SEC title at stake in Gators’ regular-season ﬁ  nale with ‘Cocks
  Saturday’s showdown between Florida and Georgia has a 
lot riding on it, both immediately and as it relates to the future. 
  For coach Will Muschamp, this game means everything, and 
not because he played at Georgia. The “wasted ink,” as he called it, spent on the storyline is largely just that.
  Every game has had sentimental signiﬁ  cance for Muschamp. 
Against Tennessee, he faced good friend Derek Dooley. Against Auburn, he returned to the school where he served as a gradu-ate assistant. Against Alabama, he faced mentor Nick Saban, and against LSU, he was going back to the stadium where he coached for four years. 
  This game is huge for Muschamp because rivalry games are 
the measuring sticks by which coaching careers are judged. The Gators have won 18 of their last 21 against the Bulldogs, and 
Muschamp is going to be expected to continue that streak, or else. 
  Just look at Mark Richt. In his 10 sea-
sons as Georgia’s top dog he has won two Southeastern Conference champi-onships and ﬁ  nished in the top 10 of the ﬁ  nal AP poll ﬁ  ve times. But, because he hasn’t won a national title and is 2-8 against the Gators, he’s sitting on the hot seat. 
  Muschamp has to keep UF’s run versus UGA going, because 
if he doesn’t, he’ll be the orchestrator of Florida’s ﬁ  rst four-game losing streak since 1988. 
  Think back to last season.   The Gators won their ﬁ  rst four games, suffered three consec-
utive losses and then pulled off a thriller against the Bulldogs. That wasn’t nearly enough to satiate outraged fans, but to some extent it salvaged the season. 
  An 8-5 year with an Outback Bowl win against Penn State 
may not look like much on the surface, but it’ll seem pretty damn good compared to what could happen if Florida loses this game. 
  A defeat drops the Gators to 4-4, silences the SEC title mur-
murs and makes bowl eligibility a legitimate question, especial-ly with a surprisingly average Vanderbilt team primed to catch UF at its lowest point. 
  A win brings Florida to 3-3 in the conference, which would 
put it one game behind Georgia and two behind South Carolina in the East. With a matchup against a Lattimore-less Gamecocks still upcoming, that margin would hardly be insurmountable.  
  Even if it doesn’t lead to an East title, a win keeps Florida 
on the map. There’s no such thing as an off year or rebuilding season in college football — boosters and recruits are always watching. For the sake of their image alone, the Gators need to prove something against a winning team. 
  The four ﬂ  oundering groups Florida has beaten are a com-
bined 7-21, including 0-11 against SEC opponents. The three legitimate teams the Gators have lost to are a combined 21-3, 13-2 in the SEC. 
  The Gators need to win Saturday to prove that they, and 
their coach, truly belong.
