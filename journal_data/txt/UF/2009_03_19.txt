Group offers lunch in exchange for freedoms
You can’t have your cake and talk about it, too.
On Thursday, UF’s Society of Professional 
Journalists will be hosting an event inviting stu-dents to enjoy a free lunch in exchange for their First Amendment rights.
The event will be held in the Plaza of the Amer-
icas from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Gelato Company, Peach Valley Café and Publix will provide food.
 “If you sign your rights away, you can’t talk in 
line, no praying and three people cannot talk in a group,” said Lydia Fiser, the vice president of SPJThe goal of the event is to make students more 
appreciative of rights they may take for granted, such as speaking freely and peacefully assembling. Members of Theater Strike Force, a local acting group, are volunteering as “First Amendment Police” and will be donning camouflage, shields and batons to make sure everyone who has sur-rendered his or rights stays within the law.
Offenders who are caught talking will have 
their food taken away and will be thrown in First Amendment jail, Fiser said.

The departments of religion, geological 
sciences, and communication sciences and 
disorders would see substantial cuts and fac-ulty layoffs under a budget proposal unveiled Wednesday by College of Liberal Arts and Sci-ences Dean Paul D’Anieri.
D’Anieri presented the proposed CLAS 
budget cuts to about 350 people in the Reitz Union Auditorium.
The cuts, which total about $9.3 million, 
would bring the CLAS budget to about $86 million, down from $108 million in 2006-2007.
His proposal includes the elimination of the 
equivalent of about 103 full-time positions.
Of those, 37 are positions that would be va-
cated by people retiring or quitting, D’Anieri said.
D’Anieri is the first dean to release a pro-
posal that outlines a plan to implement the 10 percent cuts UF President Bernie Machen requested. Machen asked all colleges and ad-ministrative units to make in anticipation of a possible reduction of $72 to $75 million in state 
funding in 2009-2010.
But UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said 
UF’s cut could be even larger than that. As a result of the new revenue projections released 
by state economists Friday, UF’s budget cut could be as big as $84 million, Sikes said. 
She said that estimate, however, doesn’t On c AMpUSCLAS dean proposes $9.3M budget cut
� UF MUST CREATE GUIDELINES.

UF’s Board of Trustees, the university’s 
highest governing body, approved federally 
mandated identity theft prevention measures at Tuesday’s meeting.
The measures require that UF create a set 
of guidelines to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft, according to board documents.
The board was also informed of UF’s plans 
to centralize its information technology op-
erations, which will also help prevent future 
privacy breaches, UF officials said, though that was only one reason for the proposed changes.
The new measures follow four recent cases 
of identity theft, one in which a student stole a UF employee’s identity and was able to get 
about $31,000 in loans by using the employee 
as a co-signer.
“The first month he got $15,300,” Susan 
Blair, UF’s chief privacy officer, told trustees at Monday’s Audit and Operations Review com-mittee meeting.
“He apparently thought that that was a 
good idea, so he went back another month and got $16,000,” Blair said.
Two other cases involved theft of medi-
cal insurance information, and the last case 
involved a patient at the Orthopaedics and 
Sports Medicine Institute having his personal Trustees approve measures to prevent identity theft

Gainesville will receive $930,000 
for community development and 
homelessness prevention in the city’s first chunk of the $787 billion federal stimulus package. 
The money is being allocated 
a month after the bill was signed into law.
“This is the first bit of money 
that we’ve actually been told ‘this is yours,’” said Jeanna Mastrodi-
casa, a city commis-sioner.
The Alachua 
County Housing Au-thority will receive 
$370,000 for community develop-ment in Gainesville and another $560,000 for homelessness pre-vention, according to a U.S. De-partment of Housing and Devel-opment e-mail to Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan.
The money is part of $10.1 bil-lion which was allocated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The money was distributed 
with a population-based formula, said Lauren Poe, a city commis-sioner.

Man’s death spurs City’s 
vow to communicate more
After the disappearance 
and death of Gainesville engi-
neer John F. Waldo, the Public 
Safety Committee is working 
to improve communication be-
tween various city departments in Gainesville. 
John Waldo’s mother, 
daughter and fiancé, all at-
tended a committee meeting 
Wednesday to hear what the 
city is doing to prevent cases 
like Waldo’s from reoccurring. 
Waldo was reported missing 
on Feb. 11, and his body was 
found Feb. 23 in a car that had 
been ticketed seven times. 
“There’s just so much that 
needs to be done,” said Kris-
tina Torres, Waldo’s daughter, 
at the meeting. “After you put that first ticket on the car, you 
should run that license and run 
that VIN number.”

The chant “No More Cuts,” rang through 
downtown Tallahassee as about 1,000 students, 
parents, teachers and administrators represent-
ing 67 of Florida’s counties gathered in front of 
the State Capitol to protest budget cuts in public education on Wednesday.
About 10 UF students went to participate. “Our goal was to get the legislature’s atten-
tion,” said UF graduate student Kali Davis, who is enrolled in UF’s College of Education. 
The rally, organized by the Florida Parents 
and Teachers Association, featured eight state 
legislators and several superintendents, a poem 
performed by students on the steps of the Capi-tol followed by a number by the local Rickards High School marching band. 
“Education is the corner stone of democracy,” 
said Sen. Alex Villalobus, R-Miami, who spoke at the event. “There is one major priority, and it’s not building roads or helping baseball teams. It’s our schools.” Several students also spoke to the 
crowd.  Two middle school students shared their 
fears of losing their school’s athletic teams and fine arts programs such as band, chorus and art. 
The majority of the crowd toted signs and 
wore shirts that read, “Make Schools a Priority,” and “Education Cuts Don’t Heal.” 
Others sought different angles to bring atten-tion to the cause. 
One woman dressed as historical French 
monarch Marie Antoinette and held a sign read-ing, “Tallahassee Says: Let them Eat Cake.”
Daniel Bathea, 11, from Lake Weir Middle 
School, said he attended the rally with other stu-dents and teachers from Summerfield, Fla., be-cause he’s worried some of his favorite teachers may be fired.
“Education is important and kids need it for 
the future,” he said, adding he hopes to one day 
attend UF.
The protest wasn’t the only 
pro-active step taken to help save Florida’s schools. Schools from all over the state collected pen-
nies throughout February to show support of a bill sponsored by Dwight Bullard, D-Miami. If passed, the bill would add a penny to the state’s 
sales tax for the next three years. 
“Two million pennies were collected,” said 
Davis, adding that UF contributed about 15,000 
of them. 
Davis said the pennies were going to be left 
on the steps of the capitol building, but partici-pants were told that was not allowed. 
Despite the symbolic setback, Davis said the 
event was a success. 
“There were some legislators out there with 
us, and others were sitting in their offices wor-ried,” she said. “We made a really big impact.”UF students ‘Rally in Tally’
UF was ordered to reinstate as-
sistant professor Andrea Pham, who was to be laid off in June as part of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences $6 million budget cut.
The faculty union filed a griev-
ance against UF on behalf of Pham last June, and the case was heard in January.
The arbitrator’s decision states 
that UF violated its contract with the union when it decided to lay off Pham, a tenure-track faculty member hired in 2002.
The decision states UF can only 
target established organizational units, such as colleges or depart-ments, within the university for layoffs. The two Vietnamese classes taught by Pham do not constitute such a unit, as UF contended, accord-ing to the decision.
The union’s agreement with UF 
also states that faculty members in a unit with less than five years at UF will be considered for layoff before those with more than five years. Pham had about six years at UF, while others in her department had less.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said UF respects the decision but 
said it is still unclear how UF will re-
spond.
“We’re still 
evaluating the 
decision, so no decision has been made on her rein-
statement,” Sikes said. She also 
noted the decision 
could affect the 
way UF handles layoffs during the next round of budget cuts.
“We hope that it will be a lesson,” 
said John Biro, president of the Unit-ed Faculty of Florida. 
“The administration has to live up 
to the agreements it has signed. If it 
violates them, we will be there to call 
them on it.”

If Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan ever finds 
herself in need of a new job, she might look 
to the food delivery business.
Wednesday was the nationwide Mayors 
on Wheels day, part of the Meals on Wheels program, where 1,040 city mayors across the 
states volunteered their time to deliver nu-
tritious meals to area seniors.
This year was Mayor Hanrahan’s fourth 
time participating in the campaign, which she said brings awareness to a “critical ser-vice.”
“It’s more than food being delivered,” 
Hanrahan said. “It’s a chance to give seniors 
some connection to the community.”
ElderCare of Alachua County, an out-reach program of Shands Hospital, sponsors Meals on Wheels. The organization runs 16 
food delivery routes daily to about 200 peo-
ple throughout the county. 
Additionally, 715 people are on the wait-
ing list to receive other services provided by 
ElderCare, such as personal care, emergency alert response and help around the house.
Those who receive Meals on Wheels must 
be over 65 years old, with the average age 
being around 70. 
Every weekday morning, 13 volunteers 
visit the small office just off of Northwest 
39th Avenue to pick up two coolers – one for hot meals and one for cold – and a map of their delivery route.
Depending on the day, additional donat-
ed food may line the hallway for volunteers to deliver. Wednesday, extra food included 
cardboard boxes filled with bags of multi-grain and cranberry bagels.
ElderCare Executive Director Anthony 
Clarizio said a hot meal is the obvious bene-fit of the program, but a more telling benefit 
is the company the volunteers can provide by checking in with seniors. 
“Many folks are home-
bound and don’t have family or friends they can 
call on if they need help,” 
Clarizio said.
Clarizio said volunteers 
are continually needed. 
When a volunteer can’t run a delivery route, one 
of the three ElderCare staff members must deliver food.
Events like Mayors on Wheels are great 
because they put a spotlight on senior nu-
trition, leading to an increase in volunteers and financial support, he said.
But this halo effect often fizzles out after 
a period of time.
“Financial support is our biggest need,” 
Clarizio said. 
He said the program has completely 
run out of funds and is actually on track to 
overspend. If this happens, Clarizio said he must come up with a way to make up that 
money.
 In total, ElderCare runs on a roughly $2 
million annual budget, which stems from 
federal grants, private donations and com-pany sponsorships.
It costs about $100 a month for seniors to 
have a hot meal delivered to them daily.
Last year, Clarizio said the program came 
within 68 cents of its projected budget.
“If I could, I would have found a way to 
spend that too,” he said.Hanrahan feeds local seniors with Meals on Wheels

� ABOUT 120 ATTENDED 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
In a quietly tense debate, oppos-
ing groups weighed in on Gaines-
ville’s controversial Charter Amend-
ment 1 Wednesday evening. 
About 120 people attended the 
debate, which was hosted by Alach-
ua County Emerging Leaders at the Best Western Gateway Grand.If passed, the amendment would 
nullify the Gender Identity Ordi-nance passed by Gainesville’s City Commission in early 2008, which currently extends anti-discrimina-tion rights to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender residents. 
Gainesville law would then re-
vert to the Florida Civil Rights Act, 
which contains no provisions for 
those groups.
Two speakers representing Citi-
zens for Good Public Policy, Mark 
Minck and Ed Braddy, argued in favor of the amendment. The group formed soon after the ordinance 
passed last year. They wish to see 
it overturned, claiming that it is too vaguely worded and puts some citi-zens at risk. 
Opposing the amendment were 
two representatives from Equality is 
Gainesville’s 
B u s i n e s s , 
City Commis-
sioner Craig 
Lowe and Shelbi Day.
The debate focused on the so-
cial and economic implications the 
amendment would have on the city if passed.
The pro-amendment group 
claimed the ordinance was unnec-essary, citing a lack of reported in-cidents of discrimination against transgender people.
Lowe argued that if Gainesville 
were to overturn the ordinance, 
businesses would be discouraged 
from settling here, as Apple was 
in Round Rock, Tex. when the city 
passed similar legislation.
Day argued that UF, the city’s 
largest employer, took a strict stance 
against the amendment, claiming it would make it harder to recruit stu-
dents and professors. 
In the end, the opposition ac-
cused the amendment’s proponents 
of using scare tactics like the issue of sexual predators in women’s bath-rooms to misinform the public as 
to the amendment’s discriminatory 
effects. 
The pro-amendment group in-
sisted that Gainesville’s citizens 
don’t want discrimination pro-
tections in the City Charter and shouldn’t have to accept legislation they find questionable.LOCAL

More fuel was added to the UF budget fire with word of 
the possible elimination of 66 faculty and staff positions in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
Dean Paul D’Anieri spoke 
with members of the col-lege on Wednesday, reveal-ing preliminary plans that would outline how budget cuts would affect CLAS in the worst-case scenario. 
The situation is proving 
to be a tenuous one for all in-volved. There remains a great 
deal of uncertainty consider-
ing nothing will be finalized until senior administrators release a campus-wide plan next month.
Simply put, there is no so-
lution that won’t leave some-one unhappy.
Unfortunately, the current 
budget crisis will undoubt-edly breed devastating results for the entire UF community — ranging from students to professors. 
President Bernie Machen’s 
hopes to transform the uni-versity into a world-class institution will be dashed as prospective high school stu-dents and instructors turn elsewhere to study and teach.
Nothing like having cham-
pagne taste with beer bottle pockets, huh, Bern?
The Editorial Board can’t 
help but feel for the numer-ous faculty and staff members 
who have no idea whether 
they will remain gainfully employed at UF for the up-coming school year. 
We can only remain opti-
mistic that an alternative ap-proach can be taken to protect the livelihoods of innumer-able contributors to The Gator Nation.When celebrities face plights similar to those of ev-eryday folk, the media falls guilty of spending far too much time and resources tracking the latest 
developments.
This past weekend, actress Natasha Richardson suffered 
a traumatic head injury while skiing in Canada — a tragedy that claimed her life Wednesday evening. While there is no questioning the pain and suffering currently being experi-enced by Richardson’s family, the media’s attention to the story has bordered on excessive.
Sadly, too many members of society attempt to live vi-
cariously through the lives of celebrities by reading the lat-est issue of Us Weekly or scouring the Internet for photos of Lindsay Lohan’s most recent brush with the law. Thus, we 
see a vicious cycle in which the media feeds the beast of the 
general public who crave deeper insight on terribly insignifi-cant “stories.”
Given the current economic circumstances that surround 
America, there are far more important issues the media should be covering with greater care and, in turn, demanded by the public. From AIG to the latest updates about the credit market, what really matters in the news has nothing to do with some actress who fell victim to a freak skiing accident. 
Of course the attention paid to celebrities is nothing new 
in the American media, but perhaps it is time for us to grow up and cover only what truly affects the lives of the masses. While the less desirable aspects of fame include being sub-jected to newspapers, magazines and television, the media must strive to be more respectful of the Hollywood elite in their times of peril. 
You’ve got to hand it to the pope. He can get away with saying stuff that would result in public cruci-fixion for anyone else.  
Tuesday, for instance, he told a crowd of Africans that 
using condoms may help the spread of AIDS.
Yeah, he went there.I don’t consider myself a qualified expert on public 
health, but I’m going to say that using condoms doesn’t, per se, spread AIDS. The pope may be a bit off the mark here, but he has some good points in his argument.
He said that the best way to stop the spread of AIDS is 
through the values of marriage, chastity and fidelity. Old 
fashioned, sure, but pretty hard to argue with. If everyone 
born from here on out waited until marriage to have sex and stayed loyal to their spouse, AIDS would practically disappear within a few generations. 
It is completely unfeasible to actually expect everyone 
to do this, but it makes sense for the pope to advocate these Christian values.
The other part of his argument is a good bit more de-
batable, and hence we get the controversy. He argues that condoms encourage sex — albeit safe sex — and thus make people more likely to spread the disease.
Is he right? The evidence is mixed. Most evidence from 
liberal, pro-sex ed groups says that condom availability does not encourage sexual activity, while evidence from conservative Christian groups says that it does.
Basic economic theory says that it probably increases 
promiscuity to a degree. Take high school sex ed classes, for instance. If you put a condom in front of a horny teen-age boy and tell him “If you use this device, you can have sex without any consequences,” there’s a good chance he’ll give it more consideration than if he thought the ol’ hanky panky would result in syphilis, the clap and a baby.On the other hand, if you don’t 
give out condoms, there are plenty of horny teenagers who do it any-way and wind up with syphilis, the clap and a baby.
Then there’s also the consider-
ation that a lot of teenagers, and even college students, probably shouldn’t be having sex, safe or not. 
Sex is a heavily emotional and intimate experience that 
many people in our generation take far too lightly. UF’s 
commonplace drunken party hookups cheapen the emo-
tional value of sex and turn it from an intimate experience into carnal fucking. Few could argue that passing out con-doms would help alleviate this problem.  
The pope argues that the best sexual experience comes 
from waiting until marriage because of the emotional in-timacy that can be expressed through such an act, which also has the benefit of eliminating the possibility of STDs for people who remain faithful to a monogomous relation-ship.
Unfortunately for His Holiness, few people in either 
the U.S. or Africa will actually wait until marriage or even wait to get to know their partners before getting their freak on. 
The pope’s comments seem a bit harsh and decidedly 
outdated, but he’s really just being optimistic about our prospects for returning to sex as an emotional experience and stopping AIDS in the process.
And why shouldn’t he be optimistic? He’s the freakin’ 
pope.

Letters to the Editor
Columnist misses point of Pentecostal Church
I congratulate Allie Conti for venturing outside her 
comfort zone, but I am disappointed as to how little her 
horizons were truly broadened. While her observations 
as to the United Pentecostal Church may be accurate (I’ve 
never been there), expanding her generalizations to cover 
an entire denomination based on one visit is sloppy. 
First, as a Pentecostal, I can say that we do not believe 
that the way to heaven is through good works, as she im-
plies. Salvation is by faith alone – works are simply proof 
that we live by our convictions. You can’t call yourself a 
vegetarian if your favorite snack is bacon. 
Similarly, we practice our faith. The works are the ex-
ternal proof. They are not what save you.
Second, church and Christianity are not about gratifica-
tion, no matter what denomination you’re a part of. 
Are we happy with life? Yes! We don’t like to be glum any more than anyone else. 
But Christianity is not about “feeling better” about the hardships in life. 
Can church be like a party? Yup. 
You’re hanging out with people you enjoy and respect 
to honor a deity that you love more than life. How does that not inspire joy and sometimes downright giddiness?
The manner of presenting the truths of the Bible might 
change from church to church and age to age, but the un-derlying purpose and meaning is always the same. It’s not 
about surviving “like a cockroach,” as Conti stated. 
Formality is not necessary to enjoy God. Just love and 
faith.

1LSObama administration hypocritical
You know, I realize that nearly the entire Editorial 
Board is so completely infatuated with President Barack Obama, they don’t even think of “change” as a monetary 
value, but let’s really examine this.
Point one: Obama and Sen. Chris Dodd both received 
money from AIG in their campaign in 2008, to the sum 
total of about $200,000.
Obama’s talk of getting the money back is nothing more 
than political posturing. Do you really think that Obama is 
going to ask for money back from a company that donated 
so much money to his campaign? I think not.
Point two: Bonuses are performance-based. If the “pro-
fessionals” at AIG are living up to their end of the bargain, 
why should we not reward them? If the company is failing 
so badly, then we need people there who can meet or ex-
ceed their performance expectations to turn that company 
around. Should we not give them their bonuses and let 
them walk away, giving the position to someone possibly 
less qualified? 
A subpoint to this: Not every division of AIG is failing! 
AIG is a huge company with many divisions. The Finan-cial Products Division (the one that tanked AIG) may be 
the most well-known now, but another division that has shown profit leases construction equipment and airplanes. Should they not get their bonuses?
Point three: The value of the bonuses is around $160 
million. Sounds like a lot, eh? Well, let’s put it in terms of the entire AIG bailout: Less than 1/10 of 1 percent. Such a small value when viewed as a part of the whole! If it 
takes this amount of money to keep productive people on 
the job, do it! Spending millions now may save us trillions later (or, isn’t that the idea?).
Point four: Lest we not forget who authored the bailout 
for AIG, Secretary of the Treasury “bailout expert” Tim 
Geithner! This is one of Obama’s most widely regarded 
secretaries. Tisk, tisk, he knew of this! I find the posturing 
by Obama sickening. He’s breaking his promises one by 
one.
He promised no earmarks, and he failed miserably. He 
promised stricter rules on lobbyists, he failed. Now he 
wants wounded veterans to get their own insurance cov-
erage?
Barack blames his troubles on Rush Limbaugh and 
former President George W. Bush. Stop misdirecting and 
handle the problems! Our previous president inherited a 
recession from Clinton. Did he complain? No, he went to 
work. 
This “change” sounds an awful lot like politics of old. 
Broken promises, posturing, and throwing money at a 
sinking ship. Welcome back, Carter.

As many of you know, after the end of 
this semester, UF will no longer of-
fer the Vietnamese and Korean lan-
guage programs. 
Given current global realities, however, 
these programs should be expanded, not 
cut. While many would defend the removal of these programs by stating they are unnec-
essary, I disagree. Removing them would 
rob the student body of the language skills needed to compete in the markets of Viet-
nam and Korea. 
Currently over 40 percent of the trade be-
tween the United States and the Caribbean/South America is done through the state of 
Florida. The reason our state has captured such a large percentage of this trade is be-
cause of the fluent Spanish speakers that 
are available in Florida to conduct business with Latin America. Before the economic crisis, Vietnam had one of the fastest grow-
ing economies in Asia and that is likely to 
resume after global markets bounce back. 
South Korea itself has the fourth largest 
economy in Asia. 
Cutting Vietnamese/Korean programs 
would cause Florida to miss out on a golden 
opportunity to obtain a substantial portion 
of these Asian markets in the same way that it obtained its share of Latin America mar-
kets.   
The Vietnamese/Korean programs 
greatly add to the diversity and interna-tional credibility of our campus. The classes 
for both programs are filled to capacity each semester and give students an academic op-
portunity that is impossible to find at most 
universities. President Bernie Machen stated that he believes UF will one day 
become a top-tier 
university — a 
rather ambitious goal. 
How can he hope to accomplish this if he 
removes two of the programs that make UF so unique?  
Instruction of Korean language skills also 
has national security implications. North Korea’s recent announcement that it would 
launch a satellite has many experts speculat-
ing that it’s really a test of its missile technol-ogy. This is a clear example that the situation 
concerning North Korea is far from becom-
ing ideal. 
Given this, U.S. agencies will continue to 
need fluent Korean speakers to analyze in-telligence coming from North Korea. UF needs to maintain the Korean lan-
guage program to insure that the U.S. is not 
lacking in individuals that can speak the lan-
guage should the need arise.  
Once UF cuts the Vietnamese/Korean 
programs they will  be very difficult to re-store. It took 10 years for the Vietnamese language program to become a part of UF.
If cut, these programs could disappear 
for good.
At the very least, UF should wait a year 
or two before considering cutting these pro-grams. In a few months, the money that UF receives from President Obama’s stimulus 
package could eliminate the need to cut the 
programs altogether. 
We shouldn’t be quick to throw away 
something so valuable for short-term gain.

We are drowning. Not just 
in credit card bills and tuition payments, we are 
drowning in false choices.
We are told that we must choose 
between making money and mak-ing a difference, that it is not pos-sible to harness our strengths, embrace our passions and have a career at the same time. We’ve been misled, misinformed, and we’re now anxious about the future. But crisis — both economic and plan-etary — creates opportunity.
Whatever you think about your 
career during this economic mael-strom, think the opposite.
Some clarity: the world’s biggest 
needs align with dynamic oppor-tunities to engage your strengths, find meaning — and make money. 
These challenges are creating 
unseen career paths to emotionally, spiritually and financially thrive.Selflessness has never been so 
profitable. It’s also a necessity.
Yesterday’s jobs are ignorant 
to the reality-bending demands of zero emission minivans and zero waste shopping malls. Sacrificing yourself to the beast of convention-al wisdom is a 21st Century race to a better spot in the unemployment line. 
Enjoy the wait — the economy 
isn’t looking too good.

“Why the light bulb?” a student 
once asked Thomas Edison. “I find out what the world needs, then I proceed to invent.” Billions of dol-lars and one hundred years later, Edison’s answer captures bril-liantly how we should approach our future in the vice grip of an ac-celerating recession.
Today, like every other day, 
global-warming pollution is dumped by the 70-million-ton truckloads into the sewer formerly known as our atmosphere.
And tomorrow, billions live 
another day in the grinding no-medicine, no-light and no-family type of poverty. Seventy billion animals — about the number of humans who’ve lived in all of his-tory — suffer from cruel and in-humane treatment inside factory farm walls.
Don’t cry for our planet or 
yourself — reprogram bugs to beat back malaria, engineer meat that preserves our forests and human-ity, write to amplify one hero’s voice, build a box brimming with clean power for Africa, install green roofs for a new generation of homes in New York. Make Edison proud.
Take the lead in solving the 
world’s biggest needs. Thou-sands of Americans already are. Creating the tools, law, vaccines, buildings, code, fashion and food that will allow the planet to grow stronger while empowering those living their days on income barely enough to buy a large coffee.
Whether through burgers, bugs 
or light bulbs, seek out the connec-tions between the biggest needs and your deepest strengths. Get on the Internet, Google “engineer-ing and climate change,” “biology and malaria,” “marketing and sus-tainability,” “journalism and social impact,” or other combinations that hold the informative power — through jobs or ideas — to unleash your strengths.
Finally, get to work. Our planet 
has suffered long enough waiting for the best of you.

James Schlachta said being a young 
Gainesville City Commission candidate is a 
catch-22.
On one hand, Schlachta, 33, said he has less 
work experience than most commissioners. But on the other, he said he can identify more 
with the college students.
“Although most students don’t reside 
in Gainesville permanently, they make up the majority of this city’s population,” said Schlachta, who is running for City Commis-sion At Large Seat 1 in the March 24 elections.
Schlachta graduated from UF in 1999 with 
an engineering degree and he said he wants to change how the commission looks  at students. Students are affected by the local government 
when it comes to bar ordinances, for example, 
or taxes imposed through Gainesville Region-al Utilities, he said.
“Now is our chance for the city to work 
with the students and make it a more college student-friendly town,” he said.
Schlachta said if elected, he would bring 
more technical and budgetary experience to the commission. 
In his job as coordinator of museum con-
struction at the Florida Mu-
seum of Natural History, 
Schlachta helps budget pro-posed museum projects.
In these lean budget 
times, Schlachta said, the city should adequately pay 
police officers, firefighters and schoolteachers.
“The city government 
should concentrate on the well-funding of these jobs before expanding programs and working new ones into the budget,” he said.
He said that officers and teachers train 
and start out in Gainesville but later move to Tampa or Orlando where there are better pay 
and benefits.
The commission tends to be out of touch 
with its constituents, he said, particularly on Charter Amendment 1.  If passed, the amend-
ment would remove a city ordinance protect-ing gay, lesbian and transgender people from 
discrimination. If it fails, Schlachta said he 
thinks pedophiles could abuse the right for people to use the bathroom of the gender they 
most identified with.
“One of the main reasons I’m running is be-
cause of the Charter Amendment 1,” he said. Candidate wants to make Gainesville student-friendly
UF student Starr Bishop died 
Saturday from amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. She was 21.
Born in Jacksonville, Fla., Bishop 
was a third-year architecture stu-dent.A vigil service is scheduled for 
today at 6 p.m., according to a Flor-ida Times Union obituary.
The funeral is scheduled for 4 
p.m. Friday. Both will be held at 
Assumption Catholic Church in 
Jacksonville.According to friends, Bishop 
was diagnosed with ALS last year. 
ALS is a disease that affects the 
nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, according to the ALS Associa-
tion Web site. As the cells deterio-
rate and die, the brain loses its abil-ity to control the body’s muscles.
Donna Imparato, a UF architec-
ture junior, described Bishop as a hard-working student, passionate about architecture and “kind of a 
goofball.”
She said Bishop had lots of friends at UF but began to with-
draw as her symptoms got worse. 
She said Bishop was the biggest 
Gator fan she ever met.
“She didn’t a miss a single game 
since she was a kid.”

Jeanna Mastrodicasa is not a commissioner 
who sits back and watches.
She strongly opposes the controversial 
Charter Amendment 1, and she was the 
driving force behind a recent bar ordinance 
that cracks down on underage drinking.                                                                          
She  spends most of her day bustling between her jobs as UF’s Director of Student Affairs and Gainesville City Commissioner.
Mastrodicasa, the incumbent for the 
Gainesville City Commission At Large seat, is running against four challengers in the March 24  city elections.                                                                                                
Her work to create taxi stands, formalize 
city relations with student organizations and keep bars open to underage locals displays her dedication to the students, she said.
“I think I made a mild set of changes that 
will only affect problem bars,” she said about her work on a recent ordinance that tightens age restrictions on bars with excessive under-
age drinking violations.            “I’m not perfect, and I don’t make perfect decisions all the time,” she said in her city hall office on Wednes-
day. “But I try.”
She opposes Amend-
ment 1 largely because of 
its proposed ban on the creation of new protected 
classes, such as veterans, pregnant women or obese people.
“It really flies in the face of local govern-
ment,” she said.
The amendment would nullify Chapter 8 
of the Gainesville Code of Ordinances, titled “Discrimination.”
In effect, this would remove protected sta-
tus for transgender, lesbian, gay and bisexual Gainesville residents and loosen protections for other classes.
“This really goes against what Gainesville 
is about,” she said. Mastrodicasa makes changes, opposes Charter 1

Trimming the budget and helping citizens sur-
vive the recession are top priorities for Gainesville 
City Commission candidate Marcia Wimberly. 
Running against incumbent Scherwin Henry 
for Gainesville’s District 1 seat, Wimberly moved 
to Gainesville from Albany, Ga., in 2004.
She said that a lot can be learned from living in 
other cities. 
“People are aware that things are done differ-
ently in other places,” she said. 
Although this is Wimberly’s first time running 
for public office, she said she is qualified because she has the time to work on projects, attend meet-ings and put thought into her decisions.
While campaigning, residents 
asked her why relief programs 
that are available in other states are not offered in Florida. 
She said she sympathized with 
the young mothers being evicted 
and elderly people having their 
power shut off, and she wants to help.
She said talking to struggling 
residents makes her want to create a program 
like California’s Renters Rebate program, which 
returns 19 to 21 percent of the renters’ property taxes to the elderly, disabled and low-income households. 
Ideally, the refunded money will re-enter and 
stimulate the local economy, which is Wimberly’s main priority.
Additionally, she said she’d vote against waste-
ful spending and that she would have opposed the 
recent $1.1 million expenditure on the Ironwood 
Golf Course, which she said hasn’t had a profit for 12 years. 
As a single mother of a 13-year-old daughter 
named Kharrie and a former foster mother of 10, Wimberly said the city government should take a more active role in Florida’s education system.
“The schools really spend more time with them 
than the parents,” she said. 
While fostering, Wimberly saw the need for 
more social programs that teach life skills that are not learned in the classroom, so she created the mentor program Life Coaching for Teens, to assist 
adolescents and their families outside of school.
As for her stance on the  much-debated Amend-
ment 1, Wimberly said she opposes discrimination 
and the amendment.
“I would not like to see us regress in any way,” 
she said.Wimberly vows 
to trim budget, provide relief
take into account possible 
mitigating factors like the economic stimulus package.
D’Anieri presented his 
proposed cuts in ten tiers, 
with the first tiers represent-
ing cuts that would be less devastating than those in later tiers.
The first three tiers would 
not involve any faculty or staff layoffs.
The fourth and fifth tiers 
would involve laying off some staff and faculty, in-cluding graduate assistants.
The eighth tier would cut 
the budget of the geological sciences department by about half, according to chairman Michael Perfit.
The ninth tier would take 
a big chunk out of the depart-ment of communication sci-ences and disorders, while the tenth tier would remove about 65 percent of the fund-ing for the department of reli-gion, according to chairwom-an Narayanan Vasudha.
The chairs of each of the three departments defended their units at the presenta-tion.
“The academic study of 
religion is crucial to under-stand the diversity of society, our society, 
the history of 
our country and the world,” Va-sudha said. “It 
is unthinkable that a univer-sity of UF’s caliber would be without a strong department of religion.”
D’anieri said each of the 
departments being consid-ered for large cuts are strong departments and said he hoped the cuts don’t happen.
If they do, he said he 
would work with the depart-ments to try to ensure that ev-ery student would be able to 
finish his or her degree.
He also said he looked 
forward to public comment 
on the proposals and stressed that nothing is set in stone.
“These are just a draft of 
my proposals,” he said.
“I fully expect them to 
change over the next several 
weeks.”LOCAL ELECTIONS

all the breaches, starting to have quite a reputation in the university community,” 
she said.
She said more breaches are possible.“I don’t think its gonna go away until

You’re splat in the middle of Turlington, running late to class, again. You 
see him first – the boy in the blue collared shirt, clutching a pile of fliers. 
Your first instinct is to sprint the other way, but there are easier ways to 
avoid another handout, even if you’ve already made eye contact.
1) Is that your phone vibrating? Even if you haven’t received a phone call all 
week, hold your cell phone up to your ear like it’s an emergency. Your aunt is 
in the hospital and this phone call is life or death. Point accordingly to your 
phone.
2) Break out your iPod or other audio device and adjust the volume until 
everyone in your two-foot vicinity knows you’re listening to Lady Gaga. When 
approached, respond by lip-syncing the lyrics, preferably the inappropriate 
ones. 
3) Empty the content of your backpack into your hands. Between your 
textbooks, notebook, laptop and other potentially heavy belongings, you 
couldn’t possibly handle the weight of a flier. Shrug, sigh and walk away. 
4) Whether you’re walking solo or with a friend, grab the hand of the near -
est person and make them your date, at least for the next two minutes. 
Stare lovingly in his or her direction, like there’s no one else in Turlington 
Plaza, not even the boy with the fliers. Start skipping if you have to.

neur who lives in Gainesville and 
created her own blog. She gradu -
ated from UNF in 2008 with a 
Public Relations degree. 
Condatore avoids meetings over 
meals, loathes chipped nail polish 
and fully insists on grammatically 
correct e-mails. 
Condatore, 23, has brought her 
passion for Southern Living to 30,000

blog that seamlessly blends contem -
porary taste with the polish expected 
of the Mason-Dixon debutante set.

Paired with write-ups in The

The Love List has ledd to a lovely, 
“legitimate source of income” -- no 
bailout dollars required. 
“It is bittersweet as your own 
boss,” she explains. While you won’t be pink-slipping 
yourself, Condatore insists the self-
employed have a disciplined work 
ethic in order to maximize the work 
that comes in. 
As traditional job 
opportunities be -
come increasingly 
scarce, an estimated 
8.5 million Ameri -
cans were self-
employed this past 
January, according 
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Economists tend to agree that in a 
recession there is a significant rise in 
self-employment. 
As your own boss, don’t expect 
miracles overnight and don’t beat 
yourself up for making mistakes, 
Condatore explains. 
“Be kind to everyone, no matter 
how much you’d like to tell them 
off,” Condatore suggests for a new 
entrepreneur. 
“And, for goodness’ sake, make 
sure your foundation matches your 
skin color.”Students were dropping 
their pants right in the middle 
of campus Tuesday night.
But it was no exhibition -
ist convention; it was a frantic 
costume change during a dress 
rehearsal for Shakespeare in 
the Park’s upcoming play.
Shakespeare in the Park, a 
UF student-run theater organi -
zation, will be presenting “The 
Taming of the Shrew” on Fri -
day and Saturday at 7 p.m. and 
Sunday at 4 p.m.  in the Plaza 
of the Americas. This  is the 
third annual production, and 
the play is almost two hours 
long.
The five-act play is a love 
story between the shrewish 
Kate and her equally crass suit -
or, Petruchio.
Set in the 1950s to make the 
outdated themes more relevant 
to today, the show still stays 
true to Shakespeare’s words, 
making it a very “Romeo + 
Juliet”-esque performance.
“We’re trying to make 
Shakespeare more accessible,” 
said Haley Likens, president and assistant director. She 
hopes the play ultimately 
“shows how much things have 
changed.”
“It’s not very PC, so we try 
to handle it in a lighthearted 
manner,” she said of the play’s 
blatantly misogynistic premise.  
“The 50s sort of emulate those 
gender roles.”
The troupe originally 
planned to set the show in 
the 80s but realized during re -
hearsals it didn’t really fit. 
Despite the more familiar 
scenery, the language may still 
be difficult to follow.
The grassy stage is outlined 
by luminaries which are all that 
separate actor and audience.
Daniel Kistler, who plays 
the leading man, Petruchio, 
does not mind people walking 
by during the show.“Distractions are gonna 
happen,” he said. “Every time 
we perform it something goes 
a little differently.”
The actors are trained to 
react to possible interruptions 
from simply being outdoors, 
like if an airplane flies over -
head they are all supposed to 
shout “air raid!”
Being outside is second only 
to, well, Shakespeare when it 
comes to Shakespeare in the 
Park, which is a global organi -
zation.
Although UF’s group is 
not officially affiliated, it was 
founded on the same belief 
that performing Shakespeare’s 
work is just as important as 
reading it.
The 17-member group is 
made up of English and jour -
nalism majors and only two 
theater majors.
The cast bought all of its 
own costumes and built the set 
themselves.

“Who Killed Amanda Palm -
er?”
Is this the headline of the 
nightly crime news beat or the 
title of Amanda Palmer’s debut 
solo record?
Amanda Palmer, half of caba -
ret/rock band The Dresden Dolls, 
explained why she decided to 
title her new solo album, “Who 
Killed Amanda Palmer?”
“It mostly started out as a 
joke because of Laura Palmer on 
‘Twin Peaks.’ I’m a huge David 
Lynch fan. I figured for anyone 
who didn’t get that reference, it 
was still a cool album title.”But she is quick to point out 
that it is not a concept album. 
“It is a collection of songs with a 
concept title.”
Palmer will play a show at 
Common Grounds Wednesday 
with Vermillion Lies. Tickets are 
$12. Doors open at 7 pm and the 
show starts at 8 pm.
In addition to the 90s show, 
“Twin Peaks”, Palmer cites many 
musical and non-musical inspira -
tions for her music:
“There’s a lot. I loved Prince 
and Madonna when I was little,” 
she said. “They were my big role 
models.”As she grew up, her taste in -
volved such diverse acts as The 
Cure and Phillip Glass. Influ -
enced by the 
sounds around 
her, she takes 
inspiration from 
elevator music 
to music she 
finds on the In -
ternet.
After being a 
part of successful duo The Dres -
den Dolls, Palmer wanted to go 
solo.
“We took a little break — a 
long, extended hiatus — but 
we’re definitely going to play to -
gether again.”Palmer said of the Dresden 
Dolls that she “wrote all the 
songs and played the keys. Brian 
played Drums. There’s a really 
fantastic chemistry between us.” 
Palmer also cited another un -
usual instrument she is proficient 
in. 
“I whip out my ukulele occa -
sionally,” she said.
Sonically, there is a slight dif -
ference between Palmer’s solo 
songs and her duo work.
But thematically, playing 
alone versus playing with a band 
is quite a different experience for 
her.
“It’s a lot like the difference 
between traveling alone and traveling with a friend. It’s very 
different. Playing solo is very lib -
erating, but I also often miss the 
give and take of being in a band,” 
she said.
Continuing with the cabaret 
theme from her Dresden Dolls 
work, Palmer’s solo show is 
known to be like a living art can -
vas, often traveling with a violin 
player and a troupe of four stage 
actors called the Danger Ensem -
ble.
As a companion to her Ben 
Folds-produced debut record, 
Palmer will also release a book  of 
photographs to be accompanied 
by commentary by Neil Gaiman, 
who wrote “Coraline.”JENNIFER ARELLANO  � AVENUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER

Steak and Blow Job Day deserves recognition
Guys, before I say anything, I owe you 
an apology. With spring break creeping 
up on us, I had no choice but to write 
this column a tad too late. But hey, 
better late than never, right? Girls, I’m 
sorry as well, because after reading this, 
your future beau will never again allow 
March 14 to be overlooked.
Alas, I announce the holiday most 
of us let slip through the cracks: “Steak 
and Blow Job Day.” It’s one month after 
Valentine’s Day, and instead of being 
showered with candy and flowers, men 
expect the two things they treasure most 
in life: a steak and a blowjob. 
It sounds easy, right? Two very sim -
ple things that bring more pleasure to a 
man than any box of Godiva chocolate covered cherries could ever bring. 
If you think about it, making a steak 
dinner is a lot cheaper than eating out 
like a couple would do on Valentine’s 
Day. And forget spend -
ing foolish amounts of 
money on flowers that 
will die next week. 
Even though a blowjob 
only lasts for—well, 
that depends on many 
things—regardless, the ephemeral mo -
ments of blowing bliss will please a guy 
without denting your savings account. 
But though guys might think a little 
kitchen action isn’t much to ask for, some 
girls will easily disagree. The modern 
age of takeout has deflated the common notion some men have of girls being ex -
pert cooks. Everybody is in a rush these 
days, and it’s easier to simply call Gator 
Food than it is to find a recipe and shop 
at Publix. We women aren’t necessar -
ily as kitchen-savvy as 
some might think.  
But if you’ve got 
the right ingredients (a 
grill pan, olive oil and 
steak seasoning) and 
the simple techniques, 
whipping up a classic 
dinner isn’t that hard.
But the other part is tricky: to blow 
or not to blow? Blowjobs fall under a 
vague category when it comes to sexual 
activity. Some girls love doing it and 
pride themselves on this ability, while other girls detest it and won’t go on a 
trip down south no matter who the guy 
is. And some girls don’t mind it if he’s 
really someone special. 
The problem is that a lot of girls real -
ly don’t know what they’re doing down 
there. Just like the steak, if you have the 
right techniques, it’s not that hard, no 
pun intended. 
Girls who claim blowjob abomination 
might not really hate it as much as they 
think. But, according to www.steakand -
bjday.com, (I know, I can’t believe it 
exists either) “blow jobs are like pizza, 
even if they’re bad, they’re still pretty 
good.” 
On Valentine’s Day, boys are required 
to know our favorite flower, so why can’t 
they be spoiled once in a while?The modern age of 
takeout has deflated the 
common notion some 
men have of girls being 
expert cooks““ASHLEY ROSS  � AVENUE WRITERShakespeare goes modern

Take one part Seth Cohen, half 
a tablespoon of Blair Waldorf, a 
dash of grunge, a side of abrasive -
ness and minds comparable to a 
music encyclopedia; let sit for four 
minutes in a hipster rock venue 
with hot, diehard-music-loving 
twenty-somethings trapped in a 
world driven by hormones and 
you’ve got “Rockville, CA.”
Josh Schwartz, famed as the ex -
ecutive producer of “Gossip Girl” 
and “The O.C.,” opens the doors 
to California’s underground music 
venue, Club Rockville, on the new 
music-oriented series created for 
TheWB.com, an interactive video-
on-demand network, on March 17.  
The series focuses on the hap -
penings at the club and features 20 
webisodes, each about four min -
utes long. And though the cast is 
comprised of heartthrobs, leading 
lady Alexandra Chando said mu -
sic is the major thread throughout 
the show. 
Each webisode headlines a dif -
ferent band or artist, whose lyrics 
help play up the story or plot. Mu -
sic supervisor Alexandra Patsa -
vas handpicked the underground 
artists like Earlimart, The Broken 
West, White Lies and The Kooks. 
While speculation of the show 
is predicting another Schwartz hit series that will impact young gen -
erations and popular culture, the 
success of the online medium is 
entirely uncertain. 
“As far as material, it’s easily 
as effective as [other shows],” said 
Andrew J. West, who plays Hunt -
er. “It targets a certain generation, 
it’s very relevant to college age and 
current trends.”
Schwartz said in an e-mail that 
things on the Internet are moving 
at an incredibly fast pace. Now 
content has no stigma in terms of 
where things show up or how they 
are viewed or how long they are, 
which is part of the Web series 
evolution. 
Chando wants to raise the bar 
for the online medium. 
“It’s not just some YouTube 
video,” she said. 
Chando plays Deb, the driven 
music fiend who’ll describe any -
thing with her favorite adjec -
tive, ‘major’, who stumbles upon 
Hunter, the hipster-cute guy with 
an opinion on everything. The two are more perfect 
for each other than 
they know, and 
they dance around 
a typical roller 
coaster relation -
ship. 
But West said 
it’s not exactly the 
same old expected 
TV relationship 
and will leave 
viewers really 
wondering what’s 
going to happen. 
The trends on 
“Rockville, CA” 
don’t come from 
style, fashion or 
money. Instead, 
there’s an indie 
vibe that pervades 
the series, offering 
music as a way to 
s u b c o n s c i o u s l y 
wrestle with the 
general emotions 
and conflicts of 
young generations. 
The show’s music is a periph -
eral bearing to the story following 
the couple and its other romantic 
pursuits, he said.  
All the bands are quite differ -
ent, too, fitting under the large um -brella of rock music. But general 
consensus for a favorite comes to 
“White Lies,” an alternative band 
from west London.  
Each band is only seen for about 
30 seconds per webisode, but the 
entire band’s set and interviews 
are available online. West said the music is extremely 
relevant to what’s happening with 
music right now, and it helps deal 
heavily with universal emotions. 
“Music is important for every -
body, it helps give young people a 
voice at a time they most need it,” 
he said.ASHLEY ROSS  � AVENUE WRITERRockville shows music scene

The banners were strange. They were painted black 
with a diamond-shaped logo that doesn’t belong in the O’Connell Center. They read “National Invita-
tion Tournament” and spoke of postseason dreams, but not the postseason dreams with shining moments and the usual Madness.
Only 4,350 fans showed up to watch UF brush Jackson-
ville aside 84-62 on Wednesday night, and the rest of The 
Gator Nation missed the team announcing to the country 
that it is ready to accept college basketball’s consolation prize. After all, that’s all that’s left for the Gators.
“There’s nothing else we can do,” forward Dan Wer-ner said. “We’re in this tournament. When you’re a competitor, your goal is always to win.”
So what if the NIT is the NCAA 
Tournament’s weird little brother no one pays attention to? UF is in it to win it.
Nobody would blame this Gators 
team for dogging it up and down the court at this point in the season. After 
a 16-2 start that looked incredibly promising, the bottom fell out, and the NIT became their playoffs.But instead, the Gators ran hard, sweated on defense, 
drove to the basket, slammed home dunks and fought for rebounds in the game’s waning moments.
For those of you who couldn’t make it to the game — 
and there are a lot of people who fit that description — and for those of you dismayed that television executives decided this game didn’t merit airing, you missed a team that is not ready to give up on its season.

Nick Calathes looked a lot more like his old self Wednes-
day night.
The sophomore scored 19 points and dished out six as-
sists as UF (24-10) rolled to an 84-62 win against Jacksonville 
(18-14) in the first round of the National Invitation Tourna-ment in the O’Connell Center.
The All-Southeastern Conference point guard struggled 
down the stretch in conference play.
In UF’s final three games of the season, he scored in dou-
ble figures just once (11 points against Arkansas in the SEC Tournament) and turned the ball over 16 times.
“I’ve been in a shooting slump, and it felt good hitting 
a few shots,” Calathes said. “And to be honest, it felt good 
winning.” 
Though forward Chandler Parsons was replaced in the 
starting lineup by freshman Erving Walker (11 points), he 
notched his second double-double of the season, scoring 17 points and grabbing a career-high 14 rebounds.
“When he takes it to the glass and runs the floor like that, 
he’s a different player,” Calathes said. “I think he changed the game for us.”
UF coach Billy Donovan said the change to the lineup is Calathes returns to form in UF’s win over Jacksonville

ORLANDO — FSU may have 
been billed as the big midweek in-
state rivalry game for UF, but you would never know it from the crowd that turned out at Jay Bergman Field to watch Central Florida take on the Gators. 
A record crowd of 2,758 wit-
nessed UF (11-7, 0-3 Southeastern Conference) come away with a 7-3 win. 
Freshman right-hander  Antho-
ny DeSclafani (1-0, 5.02 ERA) got the start and pitched five innings, al-lowing just 1 run in his first college win. The power pitcher stayed in the strike zone all night, throwing first-pitch strikes to 21 of the 23 batters he faced while striking out four. 
“I always try to strike people out 
and challenge people,” he said.
DeSclafani worked out of a jam 
in the bottom of the second inning after Central Florida (7-12) put run-ners on first and third with no outs on back-to-back singles by Beau Taylor and Kiko Vazquez. DeScla-fani responded by striking out the next batter and getting the second 
out on a pop-up to catcher Buddy 
Munroe. Josh Adams, who recently moved to shortstop from third base, made a strong defensive play on a line drive to record the final out.
The Gators were the first team 
to light up the scoreboard, striking with 3 runs in the top of the third in-ning. Matt den Dekker drove in the 
game’s first run after a single chased

� THE SENIOR CATCHER WENT 4 
FOR 6 AT THE PLATE AGAINST FIU.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
Whether at the plate or behind it, Kris-
tina Hilberth made the big plays her team 
needed Wednesday.
The senior catcher had three RBIs dur-
ing a 4-for-6 outing at the plate in No. 1 UF’s doubleheader sweep of Florida Inter-national at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadi-
um.  Hilberth also snagged two foul balls, 
including a game-ending sliding grab with the tying run on third in UF’s 3-2 victory in Game 1.
“If I gave such a thing as a game ball, 
it would’ve went to Kristina Hilberth,” UF coach Tim Walton said. “She was electric, doing things you don’t even notice. She had a really, really, really good game.”
The Gators (29-2, 8-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) scored 3 runs in the second inning of their first game against the Golden Pan-thers (16-17) despite being outhit seven to four. 
UF improved on its Game 1 struggles 
with a 5-0 win in the second game of the day. The Gators put 4 quick runs on the board and nearly tripled their hit total from the previous contest with 11.
The Golden Panthers came out swing-
ing Wednesday afternoon. Fresh off her first career no-hitter, Stacey Nelson (15-2, 0.38 ERA) struggled in the circle. FIU’s seven hits were the most an opponent has had against Nelson all season.
“Stacey was probably as bad as she’s 
been all year,” Walton said. “She was 
good, but for her standards, she wasn’t 
nearly as good as she needs to be.”
After coming out strong at the plate in 
Game 1, Stephanie Brombacher (14-0, 0.72 
ERA) held the Golden Panthers to just four 
hits and struck out 10 batters in seven in-nings in the second game.
“Me and Stacey talked a little bit after, 
and I knew that the top of the lineup was 
really aggressive. So I knew I could throw 
the ball a little more off the plate, and I knew that they were going to chase it,” Brombacher said.
The closest the Golden Panthers came 
to scoring a run against Brombacher was in the sixth, when FIU’s Kim Rodriguez doubled to right field. 
Alicia Sisco found Ali Gardiner, who 
cut the throw off and found Hilberth in perfect position to tag Golden Panthers shortstop Desiree Fink, preserving the shutout. 
In Game 1, freshman Michelle Moultrie 
drove in Francesca Enea to put UF up by 1, and Hilberth singled to left field, driving in Megan Bush. 
When Moultrie was caught in a run-
down between second and third, Kristine Priebe crossed home plate for the Gators’ last run of the game.
The Golden Panthers cut the lead to 1 in the fourth inning after Bush fumbled a grounder to load the bases. 
Enea dove but was unable to grab a 
shot to left field by FIU’s Lisa Brooks, and 2 runs scored.
Nelson held off the Golden Panthers 
for the rest of the game, and the Gators se-cured the win.
With Tiffany DeFelice out for an un-known period of time with an injured wrist, Walton started Priebe at designat-ed hitter in both games and gave Sisco, a freshman, the start in right field in Game 2. Sisco responded by going a perfect 3 for 
3 at the plate.
“I’ve been working really hard on my 
hitting, and I finally came through, and it 
feels really good,” Sisco said.

the floor as a Jacksonville player 
blocked his shot with authority. Parsons didn’t hang his head — 
on the next possession, he hit a 
three.
You missed freshman guard 
Erving Walker, with UF up by 10 
points early, diving to save balls 
from going out of bounds on two occasions.
You missed freshman forward 
Ray Shipman take a brutal foul down low, slam his shoulder and wrist into the hardwood, not make a fuss and hit two free 
throws.
You missed Parsons being on 
the receiving end of an unnec-
essary and possibly intentional shove right after that and not re-
taliating as a technical foul was called on Jacksonville. Instead, 
he just walked to his bench, clap-
ping in the guilty Dolphin’s face.
“They were out of the game 
by that time,” Shipman said. “But 
we’re not going to let them push 
us around. We were pushing, 
too. I don’t want to let them think they’re getting the best of us by pushing us.”
Moments like those build 
team unity, and this is a team that needs some of that after a disappointing end to the regu-
lar season. They’re united now. 
They knocked off Jacksonville with ease, and they know what’s ahead.
“I just know we’re playing Mi-
ami on Friday,” center Alex Tyus said. “If we play our game, we can beat anybody.”
If they can play with as much 
effort for the rest of the NIT as they did tonight against an admittedly outmatched team, 
there’s no doubt the Gators can 
bring another banner back to the O’Connell Center. It won’t be the banner fans have come to expect, 
and it won’t be the banner the 
team wanted at the beginning of the season, but it would be a ban-ner nonetheless.
It’s a banner this team wants 
to win.
EVAN , from page 20home third baseman Clayton Pisani. Adams 
was next up and promptly took what would be the last pitch from Central Florida starter Bryan Brown (0-3, 11.57 ERA) off the left-field wall for a 2-run double.
Though UF scored 7 runs, coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said his team is still missing oppor-tunities at the plate. “A strikeout is one thing, but a strikeout 
with runners in scoring position is something that hurts us,” he said.
The Knights plated their first run in the bot-
tom of the fourth thanks to the Gators’ chronic infield defense problem. 
With two outs and nobody on, second 
baseman Jerico Weitzel and Adams booted consecutive ground balls before Austin Smith 
singled home an unearned run. Weitzel did 
his best to redeem himself, making a diving snag on a hard-hit ground ball and nailing the runner at first for the third out of the inning. 
“Pitching and defense 
are our two big things, and we have to do a better job of 
it,” said Pisani, who committed an error of his own. 
Orlando native Clint Franklin came in 
to replace DeSclafani after Taylor led off the bottom of the sixth with a line-drive single to right field. 
The bullpen held the lead and the offense 
tacked on 2 more runs in the seventh when Pisani drove in Daniel Pigott and Riley Coo-per with a double down the third-base line, putting UF ahead 5-1. 
The Gators scored 2 insurance runs in the 
eighth, and junior Tony Davis gave UF 1 2/3 
innings of no-hit baseball before turning the 
ball over to Billy Bullock in the ninth. 
Missed opportunities on offense, errors on defense still troublesomesomething he plans to stick with in the coming weeks.
“Chandler played 18 minutes (per game) last year. Some-
times guys have a hard time adjusting to an expanded role. 
They put more and more pressure on themselves,” Donovan said. “I thought it would be an opportunity to try and help Chandler a little bit.”
The 6-foot-9 swingman has started all but six games this season.
“As long as I’m out there playing, I don’t care,” he said.Alex Tyus (13 points) scored UF’s first 7 points and the 
Gators went on an 8-0 run early in the first half. They held the lead for the rest of the game.
The Gators played some of their best defense of the sea-
son, holding the Dolphins to just 37 percent shooting from the field and 26 percent from 3-point range.
“I wish we would have started doing this a little earlier, 
but I think we have been playing decent defense all year,” forward Dan Werner said. “It wasn’t like last year when we were awful.”
With 14 seconds left to play in the first half, Jacksonville 
forward Lehmon Colbert knocked forward Ray Shipman to the ground as he was going for a layup.
“It was a real hard foul,” Shipman said. “I could have 
got up and retaliated, but I knew that wasn’t the right thing to do. I laid down, gathered myself. My instinct, I wanted to get up and attack him. I just got my head right, looked around, knocked my free throws down.”Shipman remains composed, knocks down free throws after hard foul

It’s the invitation of a lifetime.
Freshman swimmer Melani 
Costa-Schmid knows what she needs to do in the next few days but at the same time is aware that 
this meet will be like no other.  As 
a native of Spain, she is not used to swimming measured in yards, but at the NCAA Championships, she will have to do just that.  
Thursday through Saturday will be a challenge for her and the 
18 other UF women who have re-
ceived invitations to the competi-tion in College Station, Texas. The meet is the culmination of the sea-son for the Gators (9-2).
Divers Monica Dodson and 
Kara Salamone, who qualified for the NCAAs last weekend at the Zone B Diving Championships, 
will be representing the Gators in 
the 1-meter, 3-meter and platform dives.
“I’d love to be a finalist on all three boards,” 
Salamone said. 
“I think I have a good chance. I have been training really 
well.”
Costa-
Schmid will be competing 
in the 200-, 500- and 800-yard freestyles. Though she says she is enjoying her experience at UF, her adjustment to a U.S. school and athletic program has not been 
easy. Her long-term goal is to im-
prove for the Olympics, but she is choosing to live in the moment.
“I’m happy about making 
it, but it’s weird for me. I’m lost in the American meet,” Costa-Schmid said. 
“But I will do what my coaches 
say to do and the most I can do.”
UF will bring more competi-
tors  to the NCAAs than any other school.
Freshman Shara Stafford was invited to the Championships but 
will not compete due to an injury.
“We’re going to need someone 
to step up and make an impact 
in the freestyle events without Shara’s presence,” coach Gregg Troy said. 
“She was a potential scorer in 
three individual events and in all of our relays.”
The Gators will start prelimi-
naries at 11 a.m. and finals at 7 p.m. each day. Last year, they left with a sixth-place finish.

UF gymnast Amanda Castillo performs on balance beam in 
the Gators’ 195.925 to 193.85 home win against Kentucky.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
When Amanda Castillo stung her ankle against Utah 
on Friday, UF (6-4, 3-3 Southeastern Conference) could 
only hope it was a minor injury.
Turns out it was a knockout.
Castillo partially tore her left Achilles tendon and 
will miss the rest of the season.
“She has chosen wisely, and I agree with her that 
she’s going to go ahead and get surgery and get a jumpstart on next season, saving herself about three months’ recovery time,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said.
Castillo, a two-time defending SEC champ on floor 
exercise, will be out for the SEC Championships on Saturday and any other postseason meet in which UF competes.
The latest injury marks the fourth gymnast — one-
third of the team — to have her season cut short by 
injuries.
“We’re extremely limited,” Faehn said. “We just 
don’t have the bodies to put out there.”
Even the lone senior on the team hasn’t been spared. 
Corey Hartung has not performed all-around since Feb. 
20 against Alabama. 
Hampered by a third-degree strain of the soleus 
muscle in her left calf, Hartung was limited to uneven bars and balance beam against Georgia on Feb. 28 and 
didn’t compete at all against Michigan and Utah.
She has been resting up in an effort to be healthy 
enough to do at least bars and beam in the SEC Cham-
pionships and compete in the NCAA Regional.
“We have to be very smart and careful with her,” 
Faehn said. 
“As much as she is insistent and really wants to be 
out there. She says she’s fine. I don’t doubt that, but we have to be careful.”
The team is so battered and beaten that Faehn has a 
different outlook heading into the postseason.
“Our goals have changed, and we’re not looking at anything other than what we can control,” Faehn said. 
“We’re really not focusing on the final results. We’re 
focusing on taking one day at a time and doing what we have to do to make sure these athletes feel consis-tent and hit their routines.”
Faehn said the injuries this year have shed light on 
how fortunate — and healthy — her past teams have been.
“Injuries happen to everybody, in any sport, at any 
time,” Faehn said. 
“We look at the last four or five seasons here, and 
we’ve been extremely lucky, very fortunate, that we haven’t sustained even a major injury. Unfortunately it’s kind of all happening this season.”
One glimmer of light that could be perceived as a 
positive amid injuries is the opportunities other gym-nasts are getting.
Junior Courtney Gladys is competing in the all-
around category and brought in the highest score for 
the Gators against Utah with her 9.925 on vault.
Sophomore Alicia Goodwin returned to the beam 
lineup because of the Gators’ thin roster and recorded 
a 9.875 in two consecutive meets to finish as the best 
beam performer for UF. Goodwin was pulled from 
the lineup earlier this season because of falls in three straight meets.
The door also opened for Ashley Kerr, who filled in 
for Castillo on beam against Utah. It was Kerr’s college 
competitive debut on beam.
“It was wonderful to see the athletes really step-
ping up that were helping out fill in the spots and the voids,” Faehn said.UF GYMNASTICSFour gymnasts out for postseason

Percy Harvin, Louis Murphy 
and Cornelius Ingram caught pass-
es in The Swamp for the final time Wednesday, showing off for NFL scouts at UF’s Pro Scout Day.
As always, the trio was impres-
sive, showing the players’ potential at the next level and the void the 2009 UF football team will have to fill after their departures.
“I’m wondering how we’re go-
ing to get a first down next year after watching that receiving workout,” coach Urban Meyer said. “It’s bitter-
sweet because you’re saying good-
bye to a lot of these guys, but you’re seeing a lot of hard work pay off.”
Running back Kestahn Moore, 
long snapper James Smith, tight end Tate Casey, linebacker Jamaal De-veaux, and linemen Phil Trautwein and Jason Watkins worked out as well, but the athletic tight end and 
two speedy receivers commanded 
the most attention.
Harvin and Murphy chose not to 
run the 40-yard dash — they’ll stick with their NFL Combine times of 4.41 and 4.43 seconds, respectively — but Ingram ran twice.
The NFL Combine and UF Pro 
Day amount to a season’s worth of 
football for Ingram, who is trying to 
prove he has recovered from the torn ACL that sidelined him last year.
“(The injury) is definitely not an 
issue,” Ingram said. “Going in to the Combine, I was thinking about it a little bit more, but today I was totally relaxed and just came out like any-thing else. I felt good throughout the 
day, and the knee was fine.”
Ingram will have help from agent 
Drew Rosenhaus, who was on hand 
for the workout. 
Ingram said he chose Rosenhaus 
because he represents several top pro tight ends and because of his experience with running back Wil-lis McGahee, whom he helped earn 
a first-round selection despite tear-
ing three knee ligaments just four months earlier. Harvin faces a simi-lar hurdle, as he must prove to NFL teams the injuries that plagued his career in Gainesville are over.
“It doesn’t matter who it is, if 
there’s a history of not practicing, off-the-field issues or any instability, there’s a concern there,” Jackson-ville Jaguars receiving coach Todd Monken said. “You have to have a guy go and produce when you take him as high as he’s athletically ca-pable of going.”
Harvin’s athleticism was on full 
display during the route-running drills. He made sharp cuts, showed off his speed and caught every pass thrown his way by former Gators quarterback Doug Johnson.
The 31-year-old Johnson was 
sharp, and his performance certainly won’t hurt his chances of rejoining pro football after being cut by the 
Cincinnati Bengals in 2007.
Harvin said he will meet with 
around 10 NFL teams individually 
before the draft. Monken said which-ever team drafts Harvin should use him out of the backfield, at wideout and as a kick returner, an opinion he formed while recruiting Harvin for LSU in 2005. 
Monken watched Harvin play 
for Virginia Beach Landstown High, and one play from that game stuck in his memory: Harvin took a bub-ble screen, reversed field and scored from 40 yards out as the clock ex-pired in the first half.
“That was the first time I ever saw 
him in person, and I’ll never forget it,” Monken said. “I’ve always been a big fan. That doesn’t mean squat about what the Jaguars will do, but I’m a big fan.”
‘THE PROMISE’ GETS A PLAQUE: UF 
fans are unlikely to forget quar-terback Tim Tebow’s passionate speech after UF’s 31-30 loss to Mis-sissippi, but just in case, it’s on the wall outside The Swamp.An engraved plaque near the 
door of the Heavener Football Com-
plex bears the text of “The Promise,” which CBS commentator Verne Lun-dquist said will go down as one of college football’s greatest speeches.
EIGHT RULED OUT FOR SPRING:  The 
Gators will take the field Wednes-day for spring practice, which cul-minates in the Orange and Blue Game on April 18, but eight play-ers will be held out due to injuries.
Defensive lineman Brandon Antwine (knee), linebacker Brandon 
Hicks (shoulder), offensive lineman Mike Pouncey (shoulder), kick re-turner Brandon James (foot) and receiver Omarius Hines (thighs) are among those out.
Defensive linemen Carlos Dun-
lap (abdominal strain) and Terron 
Sanders (calf), offensive linemen 
Carl Johnson (knee) and James Wil-son (feet), linebacker Brendan Beal (knee) and a few others will all be limited in practice.24, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 2009
