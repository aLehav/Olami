TAMPA — On a day that broadcasters had rallied a 
small army of reporters in preparation for one of politi-
cal broadcasting’s biggest weeks of the year, an executive 
forgot his toothbrush.
A Gator had his back.
UF students joined thousands of media members in 
Tampa this week to report on protests and Mitt Romney’s 
ofﬁ  cial nomination as the Republican presidential candi-
date. The students sacriﬁ  ced their classes to be errand-runners for the press world’s elite.
A popular internship for Gators in the Republican Na-
tional Convention media circuit is hosted by ABC News.
For telecommunication senior Luis Giraldo, the day 
starts at 5 a.m. His 12-hour days this week have been ﬁ  lled mostly with ﬁ  guring out logistics, which sometimes in-volves getting reporters’ early-morning coffee.
The 21-year-old worked his way up to earn an NPR-af-
ﬁ  liated internship during the summer, so being an errand boy is humbling, he said.
“If you were to put it in a hierarchy, runners are prob-
ably the peasants,” Giraldo said.
But then, ABC’s Diane Sawyer will walk into the room. 
Or John Oliver of “The Daily Show” will show up. Or a job recruiter will remember a student’s name.Student media get rare opportunities at convention

The Supervisor of Elections present-
ed his contingency plan for October’s 
Student Government elections at Tues-
day’s Student Senate meeting.
In the event of an emergency, Su-
pervisor of Elections Stephen Davis 
will enact his backup plan, which re-
sembles former Supervisor of Elections 
Toni Megna’s plan from Spring, ac-cording to Alligator archives.
If less than half the polling locations 
are down on either day, students will 
be directed to the nearest functioning 
locations. 
If more than half the polling loca-
tions are down for less than one hour, the voting time will not be made up. 
If that amount is closed for more 
than one hour on Oct. 2, up to three hours of time will be added to the end 
of that day. If the downtime is more 
than three hours but less than six, the time will be added to the end of the day on Oct. 3. 
If more than half of the locations are 
down for up to three hours on Oct. 3, 
the time missed will be added. But if a 
majority of the polls are down between three and six hours that day, the time will not be made up. 
If more than half the polling loca-
tions are down for more than six hours, Davis said he will move voting to a Student Senate presents

A Gainesville inmate released from prison 
to participate in a work-release program de-
cided, instead, to take some time away from 
the big house and not return until early Tues-
day.
Gainesville Police charged David Wesley 
Harteis, 25, of 13402 NE 34th Way, with es-
caping from authorities, according to a GPD 
arrest report. He returned to the Santa Fe Work Release Center on Tuesday morning.
Harteis was scheduled to work for an hour 
Monday in the center’s work-release program 
and to return by 5 p.m, said Ann Howard, 
communications director for the Florida De-partment of Corrections.When Harteis did not return, an escape 
notice and warrant was issued to the Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce and the GPD.
At about 12:50 a.m. Tuesday, Harteis re-
turned to the center, where GPD arrested 
him. He told police he was at a woman’s 
house drinking alcohol and 
smoking marijuana, ac-
cording to the report.
Harteis is serving a year-
and-a-half prison term for 
attempted robbery, ac-
cording to jail records from 
the Florida Department of Corrections’ website.
Harteis returned to prison, where he will 
continue to serve his sentence. He is expected 
to be released in May 2013, according to the 
department of corrections’ website.

� THE NEXT PRESIDENT MUST HAVE A 
STRONG INTERNATIONAL FOCUS.
ERIN JESTER
Alligator Staff Writer
A list of criteria for candidates applying to be 
UF’s next president was finalized and approved 
during a joint meeting of UF’s Board of Trustees and 
a presidential search subcommittee on Tuesday.
Over the past two weeks, the Qualifications and 
Criteria Subcommittee has refined the language of 
the list to cast the widest net possible for qualified 
candidates. 
The committee interviewed students, faculty, 
staff, alumni, donors and Gainesville residents to 
get an idea of what all of those groups would like to see in UF’s next president.
David Brown, chairman of the board, said that on 
the whole, the groups the search committee reached 
out to have been very concerned with and respon-sive to the search.
Some emphasized qualifications include having 
experience leading a land grant university, fiscal 
and political savviness, a focus on the student ex-perience and fluency in another language “or other meaningful multicultural experience,” according to the list.
Board member Marshall Criser said he hopes the 
inclusivity of the search criteria will create “an op-portunity for the best and brightest to consider the University of Florida for their next employment op-
portunity.”
Now that it’s finalized, the list of criteria will be 
circulated nationally and internationally.
In the next few months, Dianna Morgan, chair -
woman of the Presidential Search Committee, said she expects the committee to have about 1,000 con-
versations with candidates and references.
“It’s important to emphasize that what we’ve 
done so far is only the beginning,” she said.

TAMPA, Fla. — Former Massa-
chusetts Gov. Mitt Romney swept 
to the Republican presidential nomi-nation Tuesday night at a storm-delayed national convention, every 
mention of his name cheered by 
delegates eager to propel him into a campaign to oust President Barack Obama in tough economic times.
Romney watched on television 
with his wife, Ann, at a hotel across the street from the hall as the conven-tion sealed his hard-won victories in the primaries and caucuses of last 
winter.
“I read somewhere that Mitt and 
I have a ‘storybook marriage,’” Ann 
Romney said in excerpts released in advance of a primetime speech meant to cast her multimillionaire-business-man-turned-politician husband in a soft and likable light. “Well, in the storybooks I read, there were never 
long, long, rainy winter afternoons in 
a house with five boys screaming at once.”
To send Romney and ticketmate 
Paul Ryan into the fall campaign, delegates approved a conservative platform that calls for tax cuts — not government spending — to stimulate 
the economy at a time of sluggish 
growth and 8.3 percent unemploy-ment.
Polls make the race a close one, to 
be settled in a string of battleground states where neither Romney nor the president holds a secure advantage. More than $500 million has already been spent on television commercials 
by the two candidates, their parties 
and allied outside groups, with mil-lions more to come.
Romney’s convention victory was 
more than five years in the making. He was defeated in his first try for the nomination, in 2008, when he was as-sailed as a false conservative after a term as governor of Massachusetts.
This time, he had the most mon-
ey, the largest organization and al-lies with the deepest pockets, all the better to bludgeon Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and other rivals in television ads across a string of hard-fought primaries and caucuses. Even so, conservatives were slow to warm to him, and it took longer than many 
anticipated for him to lock up the 
nomination.Romney sweeps nomination, names Ryan his running mateExperience in the field has 
always been touted as the 
holy grail of UF’s College of 
Journalism and Communica-
tions. Internships are pushed from day one as the best way to secure a job postgradua-
tion.
But sometimes, that expe-
rience comes at a cost. In Gi-
raldo’s case, he’ll miss more than a week of classes, one of 
which — Spanish — he had 
to drop, because the punish-ment for his absences would have jeopardized his success 
in the class. That decision ul-
timately made it impossible to graduate on time with a Spanish double major, so he’ll graduate with a Spanish minor instead.
Wayne Wanta, journalism 
department chair, said the journalism college encour -
ages students to take advan-
tage of rare opportunities 
like covering the RNC.
However, he said, it’s up 
to the students to commu-nicate with their professors 
and be responsible about the 
work they miss.
“These opportunities 
come around once in a great while,” he said. “And it’s beneficial for our students to take advantage of them whenever they can.”
Journalism sophomore 
Erica Hernandez, 19, starts her day at 3:30 a.m. nowa-days and stays downtown until dusk collecting radio 
sound, guiding guests and 
making coffee runs for ABC News workers.
Lunch was tomato-and-
ricotta pizza, eaten standing 
and chewed between pauses 
in conversation.
“It’s not as glamorous,” 
she said. “[But] in journal-
ism, you really have to be 
doing this.”
When faced with a field 
that Georgetown University estimates has about a 7 per -
cent unemployment rate, a 
$32,000 median salary for 
recent graduates and endless stories of newspaper layoffs, some students feel the need 
to take on internships like 
this to stand out in the appli-cation crowd.
“I’m trying to do as much 
as I can to get ahead of the 
game,” Hernandez said.

The Supervisor of Elections 
does not need to present polling 
locations until 15 days before the election. 
Sen. Jordan Ball asked what 
would happen if someone were 
registered in the wrong district, 
which happened during the Fall 2011 elections. 
Davis answered that all stu-
dents are asked to confirm their addresses twice before voting. 
After the meeting, Sen. Carly 
Wilson said Davis’ plan is “lack-luster at best.” 
She said she’s concerned stu-
dents won’t be on campus to vote if the polls need to stay open late.
“Anything that goes wrong 
with the voting system, the stu-dents will suffer,” Wilson said. 
Senate President Logan Har -
rison said it’s always difficult to 
predict what could go wrong. 
“I am confident [Davis] is able 
to address any problems that 
could arise,” he said. 
The plan must be presented to 
the Senate two weeks before the election cycle starts, according to SG election codes. 
However, this was the first Senate meeting of the semester, and the election cycle starts Tues-
day. Contact Samantha Shavell at

� THE PRODUCE GROWN IN THE 
GARDEN WILL BE DONATED TO ST. FRANCIS HOUSE. 
KATHERINE HAHN
Alligator Contributing Writer
With a little help from a local nonprofit 
organization, a vacant lot in a downtown 
neighborhood could feed the homeless.  
St. Francis House, a shelter and soup 
kitchen, is raising money to transform the lot into a community garden to grow one ton of produce. The Florida Certified Organ-
ic Growers and Consumers Inc. intends to 
plant 10 55-foot rows of produce in the pri-vately owned lot, said Travis Mitchell, a co-ordinator for the nonprofit’s food projects.
“We might expand beyond that,” he 
said.
The owner of the Porters Community 
neighborhood lot has agreed to let the com-munity use the land, he said. The nonprofit 
worked with local farmers to clear the land 
and plant cowpeas, which add nutrients to the soil and keep down the number of weeds.They’ll rely on volunteers to tend the 
crops, which Mitchell said he hopes to have planted by the beginning of October.
The nonprofit hopes to raise $16,000 to 
pay for the garden and its maintenance for the year. Thus far, an IndieGoGo.com cam-paign has raised about $1,000 for the orga-nization.
But it’s not only the shelter’s diners who 
will reap benefits from the harvest.
The GIFT Gardens program, adminis-
tered by FOG, will provide Porters Com-munity-area residents with free plots in the 
garden.
The nonprofit plans to start by planting 
standard winter and fall produce such as 
collard greens, lettuce, squash and peas.  
“I really like the idea of taking these un-
used spaces and trying to create a positive example,” Mitchell said.
Lee Smith, director of operations at St. 
Francis House, said he thinks the people 
who come to the shelter for meals will enjoy 
the harvest.
“Fresh produce — that’s certainly wel-
come,” he said.Nonprofit organization will

Gainesville Police arrested three men accused of stealing a 
golf cart and trying to sell it online.
Police charged Devin Baulding, 18, Adrian McClendon Jr., 
19, and Tarris Cox, 20, with grand theft and dealing in stolen 
property by use of the Internet.
At about 7 p.m. Monday , GPD officer Daniel Beans saw the 
men pushing an EZ GO 350 golf cart out of the woods near the Lamplighter Mobile Home Park, 5200 NE 39th Ave., according to a GPD arrest report.
Beans stopped to talk to the men and told them the golf cart 
may have been stolen. The men said they believed the cart was stolen, because it had been hot-wired.
They denied stealing the cart and said they found it in the 
woods.
As Beans questioned the men, officer Natalie Loveland was 
investigating a burglary where Raymond Hatch, a Gainesville resident, reported seeing a Craigslist post with his golf cart list-ed for sale Monday . The post had a phone number attached to the description.
Hatch, 51, said on Tuesday that two of his golf carts, one of 
which was recovered several days after it went missing, had been stolen Aug. 19. Hatch said his second cart, worth about $5,000, was equipped with a hitch, a radio and off-road tires.
Beans contacted Loveland, believing the cart may have been 
related to her case, according to the report.
Loveland described the cart, which matched the one Bauld-
ing, Cox and McClendon pushed out of the woods.
When Loveland and Hatch arrived at the scene, Hatch con-
firmed it was his cart.
Loveland then called the phone number from the Craigslist 
post. Baulding’s cellphone rang, and he picked up, according to the report.
Police arrested the men and booked them into Alachua 
County Jail early Tuesday morning. Of the three men, only Cox remained in jail Tuesday night with a bond set at $4,000.

Today marks the close of UF’s first full week of class -
es — a week of experiences that, for 11 freshmen, strange-
ly paralleled those on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.
The John V . Lombardi Scholarship and Penelope W. 
and E. Roe Stamps Scholarship recipients were acclimated to college life before arriving on campus. During a six-week summer study abroad program, the students lived with host families and attended classes in Mexico.
“We’d slosh through the muddy downtown streets 
to ecology class, and many of us had broken umbrellas,” said 19-year-old communication sciences and disorders freshman Kaitlyn Johnston. “I guess that was very good preparation for UF.”
Sameer Saboungi, an 18-year-old biology freshman, 
said the trip helped him form a close network with other students before he stepped on campus.
“Once you get here, you’re still getting used to the set-
ting, but you have this base of friends you can count on,” Saboungi said.
Others made different connections between Mexico 
and UF.
“I’ve been lost in both places,” said Stephen Gibbs, an 
18-year-old chemical engineering freshman.
Gibbs compared navigating the bus system’s website 
to asking for directions in broken Spanish at 10 p.m., the first time he used public transportation in Mexico.
“The bus system is a little bit easier here,” he said.Mexico trip prepares freshmen for UFHEALTH

In his senior year of college, Dennis 
Frohlich’s stomach started hurting.
The pain soon developed into diarrhea, 
which often left him dehydrated and avoiding 
public excursions.
The UF teaching assistant and health com-
munications Ph.D. student has ulcerative coli-tis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease.
Patients like Frohlich can now rehydrate by 
drinking Enterade-R, a new beverage devel-oped by a company based in Newberry . The drink, which is mainly marketed toward can-cer patients undergoing treatment, launched Monday.“In situations where you need rapid rehy-
dration, the drink is very useful,” said Dr. Sa-dasivan Vidyasagar, an Enterade founder and gastrointestinal electrophysiology specialist.
Vidyasagar and two of his partners work 
for UF’s Department of Radiation Oncology and conduct their research at the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex on campus.
Radiation can negatively affect the small 
intestine, which controls 85 percent of the body’s electrolyte and nutrient absorptions, Vidyasagar said.
To replenish the electrolytes the intestines 
can’t totally absorb, the drink couples them with amino acids that the body can still accept postradiation, Vidyasagar said. That way, when the amino acids are absorbed, the elec-trolytes go with them, rehydrating patients.
Enterade-R differs from other rehydration 
drinks like Gatorade, because it does not con-tain glucose, which the body can reject after exposure to stressful situations, Vidyasagar said.
As a potential consumer, Frohlich was in-
trigued by Enterade-R’s concept. However, he said he’s concerned about the price of the drink and that it can only be ordered online.At about $7 a bottle, the price is due to the 
company’s desire to make the drink as natu-ral as possible, Vidyasagar said. Its proteins are taken from plants rather than fats, and its amino acids are synthesized rather than bro-ken down, so there’s no chemical residue. 
Vidyasagar said the price could drop with 
substantial sales, allowing the product to be-come more accessible.
Soon, Enterade plans to release a drink 
for general consumers, he said. But with En-terade-R, the company is targeting patients who could medically benefit from it.
That’s a concept Frohlich supports.“For people in those really dire circum-
stances,” Frohlich said, “finding better ways of getting that nutrition is really needed.”

This Labor Day weekend, a Gainesville 
festival will focus on the working class.The second annual Labor Daze Fest will 
be held Sept. 2 from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the 
Bo Diddley Community Plaza, 111 E. Uni-versity Ave. The event is free and open to the public.
The festival will include five bands, a 
rock wall, free massages and vendors from across the city, but the purpose of the event is to connect blue-collar workers with essen-tial services.“I want people to leave feeling empow-
ered,” said event coordinator Trisha Ingle.
About 40 vendors will be at the festival, 
and there will be typical festival fare like face painting and food.
Food will be provided by Hoggtowne 
Lemonade and Karma Cream, information booths will range from activism to political information, and services will include infor -
mation on job training and after-school child care.
What makes this festival different, Ingle 
said, is its focus on bringing the working class together to enhance its sense of com-munity and to engage in a dialogue about what it can do to change its city and the world.

National tragedies 
aren’t the norm
It’s human nature to want to view patterns.
We try to ﬁ  nd patterns where there are none. Patterns 
help us make sense of our environment and surroundings.
What happens when multiple tragedies happen across our 
country that aren’t related to one another but still affect us as a 
nation?
This summer was marked with violent shootings.
July 20: Movie theater mass-shooting in Aurora, Colo. Twelve 
people killed, 58 injured. Random.
Aug. 5: Sikh temple shooting in Oak Creek, Wis. Seven peo-
ple killed, three injured. Targeted.
Aug. 24: Shooting in front of the Empire State Building in 
New York City. Two people killed, 11 injured. Private.
Aug. 27: High school shooting. One injured. Random.
None of these incidents was caused by another. None of these 
incidents took place near another. All of these incidents need to 
be discussed.
There is no pattern here. There is no easy way to see what 
needs to be corrected in this country.
Do we enforce the gun laws that we have? Do we enact strict-
er legislation?
James Holmes, the Aurora shooter, behaved in such a way 
that the public now views him as essentially insane, although 
he was deemed ﬁ  t to stand trial. His story , though, leads us to 
believe that perhaps this country should focus on the individu-als who act out or seek attention.
The suspect in the Baltimore-area high school shooting listed 
the two young men responsible for the Columbine High School shooting as his inspirations on his Facebook account. This should have been a warning sign.
We believe all of these events could have been avoided on 
some level.
In the Empire State Building shooting, most of the injuries 
were caused by the New York Police Department. The suspect, Jeffrey Johnson, was a disgruntled employee who used to work in the building. None of the bystanders who were shot were se-riously injured, but it sounds like our country’s police depart-ments need more regulation as well.
It’s important to remember that these incidents are not the 
norm. Just because these shootings happened within a short time frame does not mean they happen all the time.
We don’t want to assume that danger and violence is ever 
expected. The day we start expecting bad things to happen is the day they will.
Instead, let’s focus on what we can do to prevent these strange 
phenomena from happening again.
Listen to people who might have problems. Engage in con-
versations with the people around you so that all of you will feel more connected to one another.
This sounds really lovey-dovey and faux-inspirational, but 
if we all put a little more effort into the actual people around 
us rather than the material environment, we might all feel a bit 
more at home and less likely to act out against our situations and 
surroundings.Football shouldn’t control the university
As a much-anticipated college football season kicks off at The Swamp this weekend, it may be appro-priate to look almost 1,000 miles north to Beaver 
Stadium in State College, Pa.  
Penn State will kick off the season amid a culture 
shock — unprecedented yet deserved NCAA sanctions, which shattered the foundation of the university that was college football.
There are some stark similarities between the now- 
controversial Penn State and our beloved UF.  Both have  more than 40,000 students enrolled, both are highly ranked academically as public universities, and most important to this case, both campuses thrive on their re-spective athletic programs.  
While I am not suggesting that any scandal or conse-
quence of any nature has occurred, is occurring or will occur at UF, our university has a culture, regarding its size and athletics program, that compares with those of Penn State.  
Without a doubt, intercollegiate athletics play a sig-
niﬁ  cant role on our campus. It is quite possible, some argue, that athletics supersede academics on a grand scale. While I don’t agree with that, there is no denying 
the ambiance and scope that nationally ranked college 
sports such as football, basketball and baseball play on our campus.  
There is also no denying that the revenue that the foot-
ball program brings to the university is a driving force behind its overbearing presence at UF and other large universities. In the year 2009 alone, the football program took in more than $68 million in gross revenue.
Clearly, there is a large incentive to market, recruit 
and expand the program back to the winning days of the Tebow era.
In combination with the intense tradition and passion 
for football on campus and within the SEC, success on the gridiron has been key in motivating interest in a uni-versity.
Just look at State College.Less than a year ago, the university and Coach Pater-no were praised as role models for others.
Now, the words “Penn State 
football” have garnered a toxic reputation for the whole uni-
versity, despite its academic 
prowess.
These conditions existed at 
Penn State. Football was the overriding aspect that essen-
tially deﬁ  ned campus. Legends such as the late Joe Pa-terno were essentially larger than life.  Like Wall Street during the most recent ﬁ  nancial crisis, the Penn State football program was “too big to fail.” As such, univer-
sity ofﬁ  cials seemed to, according to the report by Louis 
Freeh, cover up the horrendous and sickening actions of the disgraced Jerry Sandusky to best protect the college’s reputation.
It is my hope that UF, and other universities of simi-
lar status, does not put its entire reputation in the hands of its athletic program, or any program for that matter. While athletics should be part of UF’s culture, it should not completely encompass the university.  UF should be 
revered as both an academic and athletic powerhouse.
No program, whether academic, social or athletic 
should be considered “too big to fail,” as Penn State’s 
football program was. 
This too-big-to-fail culture fosters dishonesty, tragedy 
and disgust, which harms everyone related to the insti-tution. While it appears that schools are taking action to prevent a similar athletic scandal, it is only a matter of time until success, money and championships foster the 
culture that was in Penn State leadership.   
With Gator football  taking off this weekend, it is my 
hope that when the program thrives again we look to 
State College to avoid the development of a culture and situation that has potential to harm students, faculty and alumni afﬁ  liated with our beloved university.

Mitt Romney announced, on Aug. 11, Rep. Paul 
D. Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate. The choice of Ryan seems to have outperformed ex-
pectations.
Since then, Mitt Romney’s poll position has improved. 
The RealClearPolitics average of polls on Aug. 11 had him trailing by 4.6 points. Today, he trails by 1.1 points and continues to trend upwards.
Romney’s position in predictive models has similarly 
improved. Nate Silver’s model at The New York Times has seen Romney’s chances increase by 2.6 percent, from 28 percent to 30.6 percent, with other models showing similar gains.
And ﬁ  nally, his position in prediction markets has ris-
en since the announcement. On Intrade, shares of Romney to be President rose 5.1 points, from 38.6 percent to 43.7 percent.
Ryan has been regarded by many as one of Romney’s 
bolder vice president options. During the Obama admin-istration, Ryan has emerged as one of the party’s intel-lectual leaders and policy architects, particularly on ﬁ  s-cal issues. He was the principal author of the Republican Party’s 2012 and 2013 budget proposals.
His vigorous advocacy of reform and articulate de-
fense of ﬁ  scal conservatism are an asset to winning in-dependents as well as securing the moderate Romney’s 
right ﬂ  ank. However, his will-ingness to put forward budget speciﬁ  cs, as well as his 14-year voting record in the U.S. House of Representatives, should give 
Democrats a large cache of votes and positions to use as 
ammunition against Romney.
The clear intention of Ryan’s selection is to focus the 
2012 campaign on the economy. The extent to which this 
has succeeded is unclear — most campaign discussion was focused on the economy before Ryan was selected, and would likely have remained there had Romney se-lected someone “safer” such as Tim Pawlenty or Robert Portman.
The Romney camp hopes that the selection of Ryan 
will turn the 2012 campaign into a big-ideas campaign like the one that brought Ronald Reagan to power.
The Obama camp hopes that the partnership will be 
more akin to when moderate Bob Dole picked the con-servative ﬁ  rebrand Jack Kemp to run against the incum-bent Bill Clinton. Either way, the Ryan’s selection breaks the mold of usual vice presidential selections, which are done to balance a ticket geographically or politically and to make moves on swing states and demographics. 
As it stands, the choice of Ryan for vice president thus 
far appears to be a high-risk, high-reward campaign strat-egy that has thus far yielded a modest improvement in Mitt Romney’s electoral position.
Keith Y ost is a columnist for The T ech at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology.Paul Ryan a bold 
choice for RomneyUWireI really hate getting sucker-punched. I am 
constantly being enticed by all sorts of titil-lating bait, only to get gut-checked by an 
entirely different reality .  
“Wear AXE, so every girl will want you!”  
“Spider-Man 3 will be the most epic movie 
you’ve ever seen!”  
Not likely .  
My issue is with the expectations.  If mine 
are not met, I am often left disappointed, in-censed or embarrassed.  
I have decided to use a different approach 
with this column. Rumor has it that honesty is the best policy. I thought I would set the 
tone for this semester by issuing the following 
statement: I am going to be “that guy.”  
I spent a lot more time than I care to re-
member in Miami hair salons while I was growing up.Trapped in that cruel prison of feminine 
styling, I gleaned a few indispensable bits of wisdom that have stayed with me:
1.) There is no smell quite as vomit-induc-
ing as human hair that has caught ﬁ  re.  
2.) Jamaican patties are ALWA YS $1.  There 
is no negotiation.  There are no IOUs.
3.) Nothing makes a woman think twice 
about a curling iron like an inch-and-a-half strip of burning ﬂ  esh across her forehead.
It’s the last point that really resonates here.  After my cousin was accidentally “brand-
ed” by a negligent stylist, it took years for her to relax any time the curling iron came out.  
Although a hot curling iron has the po-
tential to make the outer beauty of a woman match her inner beauty, it also has the ability to burn and scar her. 
This column is not meant to be one of those 
curling irons.  If you’re lost, stick with me — I promise that the dots will connect.  
Two things are 
never brought up in polite conversation: politics and religion. 
Why? Because they alienate, hurt and 
infuriate in ways 
that still make us wince to this day.
I can lay one of your fears to rest right now 
by telling you that I have very little intention of talking politics in any direct manner. 
I will, however, actively discuss spirituality 
in this column, and I would like for it to not be a surprise when it occurs.  
I am “that guy .”  As cliché as it may sound, I tend to think 
of religious discourse as a hot curling iron of sorts — capable of extreme good or extreme evil. I love hearing different opinions. I enjoy when others make me think and re-evaluate the things I believe.  
Like you, I’ve been burned by the crazy 
weirdos, so I’ll try to avoid their mistakes.
If you’ve “heard it all before,” I humbly 
ask you to give me a shot. There is deﬁ  nitely a method to the madness.  
If you disagree, feel free to harass me via 
email, write a letter to the editor or apply to be a columnist next semester.  
But trust me on this: Just because someone 
approaches you with a hot topic doesn’t mean they’re trying to burn you.
At the very least, Sally Beauty Supply sells 
ointment right next to the curling irons — or so I’ve heard.

I would like to address a gender inequality that has vexed me greatly the past two weeks. Both Tropical Storm Isaac and the general rainy nature of Florida have character-
ized the beginning of classes by a stoic low-energy conﬂ  ict with nature.
Whether it is the inconsistent drizzling, the torrential 
downpours or, worst of all, the tangible humidity waiting for the bus at 3 p.m., the weather has not reﬂ  ected or encour-aged positive attitudes throughout the day.
This depression, however, is less draining when the 
proper precautions are taken. Every student knows to bring an umbrella regardless of the chance of precipitation — like-wise with raincoats.
Rain boots are an entirely different matter.
Daily , and without fail, I will step in a puddle. Given 
the high volume of rain recently , these puddles are usually 
grown from the whimsical 1-inch deep puddles trampled gleefully in RomComs, to the far more insidious 3-to 4-inch puddles that penetrate shoes and soak socks. The instant this happens, and later in the day when I remove my shoes to re-veal my pruned and misshapen feet, I think to myself “This would not have happened if I were wearing rain boots.”
Unfortunately for me and my feet, it would be impos-
sible for me to wear rain boots because, as a guy, it is not in the sphere of acceptable clothing options.
Girls wear rain boots with shorts, and it’s cute.For guys, unless you’re a construction worker in a Dodge 
Ram commercial, a butcher or a supervillain, rubber boots are just not acceptable.
And don’t get me wrong: I agree that the mental image of 
me wearing cargo shorts and rubber boots is an absurd one.
I’m not saying it wouldn’t look weird, but so did ﬁ  tted 
jeans at one point. Most clothing developments had a start-ing point embroiled in generational conﬂ  ict, but something worthy was often on the line. The T-shirt, for example, would not exist as it does today without Marlon Brando shame-
lessly and controversially sporting an undershirt as an overshirt in “A Streetcar Named Desire.”
Short shorts used to be widely 
accepted as menswear in the 80s, 
and now, despite continued scorching summer heat, I would cause some double-takes wearing mid-thigh-length hot pink shorts.
Women, on the other hand, can wear shorts of any length. 
Again, showing off my pale, hairy thighs is not my burning desire, but I would appreciate the freedom to do so.
While the transition might be uncomfortable, we must 
ask ourselves: At what cost is equality too expensive?
Who will be the ﬁ  rst to brave the slings and arrows of 
conventional society to achieve a brighter future for the feet of men everywhere?

The smells of a plate of collard greens, a half-rack of smoked ribs, Texas toast and 
macaroni and cheese waft through Adam’s Rib Co.’s second location at 1515 SW 13th St. The restaurant opened its new location Friday after a two-day delay due to a lightning strike.
� A LIGHTNING STRIKE DELAYED THE 
OPENING.

Two young boys with hands and faces 
covered in barbecue sauce sat smiling and 
waving smoked ribs. 
Two men, who didn’t know each other, 
scooted close together at the bar to enjoy barbecue with a new friend at Adam’s Rib Co.
The restaurant opened its second loca-
tion at 1515 SW 13th St. after its ﬁ  nal in-spection cleared Friday morning — three days before its expected Monday grand opening, said Michelle Brewer, co-owner of 
Adam’s Rib Co.
A lightning strike to the building early 
this summer added a two-day delay.“It was minor technicalities that led to 
why we were delayed for four weeks,” said 
Adam Brewer, co-owner of Adam’s Rib Co.
Despite the delay, patrons say the sauce 
is still boss.
“Sauce. It’s really the sauce that brings 
me back,” said Carla Williams, 43.
Williams used to eat at the original Ad-
am’s Rib Co. when she visited Gainesville 
from Tampa.
Now a Gainesville resident, she said she 
plans to eat there at least once a week.
Williams is also excited about the restau-
rant’s breakfast menu.
Mindy Esterez, a 26-year-old nurse at 
Shands at UF, said the restaurant has the 
best breakfast in town, and nothing com-pares to the biscuits and gravy.
“Biscuits and gravy,” Esterez said. “Oh 
my god. It’s awesome.”Adam’s Rib Co. opens second

Tampa and Gainesville may be hours apart, but students 
can still keep up with the Republican National Convention.
The Gator Coalition for Civic Engagement and the Bob 
Graham Center for Public Service will host a screening of 
the convention at 12:30 p.m. Thursday in Pugh Hall’s Ocora 
Room.
“We’re hoping to start conversation about what people 
are thinking about the RNC,” said Kelly MacLellan, internal 
vice president of the coalition. “Our real goal is to get people thinking about the issues.”
The Gator Coalition for Civic Engagement is a new, non-
partisan club that promotes understanding of the govern-
ment’s role in students’ lives, MacLellan said. The organiza-
tion will screen the Democratic National Convention as well.
“Any student — especially students who maybe haven’t thought about the election previously — is in our target de-mographic,” the 21-year-old journalism senior said.
Thursday’s attendees can watch streaming video from 
websites like C-SPAN and CNN. Students can also register to vote using TurboVote, an online service that simpliﬁ  es the 
absentee voting process.
“There may be a lot of people passing by who may have 
not even considered the RNC is going on,” MacLellan said. 
“Maybe they’ve heard more about the hurricane than the ac-
tual convention.”

JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida coach Will Muschamp believes 
the Gators can win with two quarterbacks. Beyond this weekend, offensive coordina-
tor Brent Pease is not so certain.
“Tough to answer,” Pease said. “I don’t 
think so. That’s my gut feeling. I don’t know 
if it’s sustainable from there.”Sophomores Jacoby Brissett and Jeff 
Driskel will split game reps in the ﬁ  rst half 
against Bowling Green on Saturday . One 
player will be under center for the ﬁ  rst quar-ter, while the other will play the second. 
At halftime, Muschamp and Pease will 
reevaluate the situation.
Regardless of how Saturday’s game 
transpires, Florida will begin the 2012 sea-son without a clear, unquestioned starter 
under center.
“I don’t think anyone was really expect-
ing that,” Driskel said. “I think they wanted to choose a starter before the ﬁ  rst game.”
Sixteen days ago, Muschamp did not 
want to be in this position. He wanted to 
know who would lead the Gators’ ﬁ  rst of-fensive drive.
“Obviously , the quarterback, I’d like to 
be a little more settled, you know?” Mus-champ said on Aug. 13.
Eleven days ago, Muschamp’s tone had 
not changed.
“The quarterback position jumps out at 
you,” Muschamp said on Aug. 18. “Maybe try to get a little more settled there.”
However, the second-year head coach’s 
approach took a dramatic turn last Friday.
After weeks of competition during 
spring practice and fall camp, Muschamp announced that both Brissett and Driskel would play in Florida’s season opener.
“They both deserve the right to play,” he 
said on Aug. 24. “They’ve earned that and they both deserve the right to start.”
On Monday, Muschamp announced his 
plans for the rotation. Brissett and Driskel 
will each have 15 minutes to stake a claim 
on the starter’s role.
Then, Muschamp and Pease will have to WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 29, 2012

UF quarterback rotation not ‘sustainable’
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Staff Writer
While the Florida coaching staff still 
has not settled on a starting quarterback, 
all parties involved in the decision feel 
good about the eventual starter’s rapport with the wide receiving corps.
Jeff Driskel and Jacoby Brissett con-
ﬁ  rmed on Monday what the coaches have 
said throughout fall practice: they are 
splitting ﬁ  rst-team reps equally, 50-50.
Although neither has played the ma-
jority of snaps with the starting receivers, 
offensive coordinator Brent Pease believes 
the chemistry will be ﬁ  ne.
“They’ve all worked with them enough 
consistently,” Pease said. “I don’t think 
they go out there and 
think, ‘OK, this guy is throwing it, so I got to adjust to his ball.’ I mean, they 
both can spin the ball, so that’s not going to matter.” 
Frankie Hammond Jr. and Quinton 
Dunbar were listed as the starting receiv-ers on the depth chart Will Muschamp re-leased on Monday.
Driskel said some of the motion in 
Pease’s new offense gave the receivers trouble in the spring, but the wideouts have put the issues behind them.
“They’ve progressed so much since 
the spring,” Driskel said. “The shifts and motions were kind of shaky. In the begin-ning of camp, we had a couple penalties with illegal procedure and stuff like that, but we’re really getting better and they’re polishing up their routes and motions as well.”
The Other Guys: Brissett and Driskel 
aren’t the only two quarterbacks getting reps, as redshirt sophomore Tyler Mur-phy and true freshman Skyler Mornhin-weg have also gotten time under center. 
Murphy has only appeared in two 
games in two seasons and has yet to at-tempt a pass. However, Pease praised Murphy’s ability to handle himself if thrown into a game.Chemistry

To most, Florida looks like a Gator 
Bowl bid waiting to happen. 
The Gators have two unproven 
quarterbacks, and neither has been named 
the starter. Even with 10 ﬁ  rst-stringers re-
turning from the eighth-ranked defense, UF is expected to struggle. 
Perhaps the Gainesville heat has 
clouded my judgment, but this UF team will prove the naysayers wrong this year. UF will ﬁ  nish 9-3. Surprising, I know.
It took until the January bowl game 
before the Gators bought into second-
year coach Will Muschamp, junior de-fensive tackle 
Sharrif Floyd said.
The Gator 
Bowl victory jumpstarted the offseason pro-gram, and the 
players realized 
a turnaround from their dreadful season 
wasn’t going to happen by accident.
“Last year ,whatever we did during 
the summer didn’t work,” junior receiv-
er Andre Debose said. “It got us to 7-6. If you want change you have to change 
yourself.”
Change is a common theme for UF 
since last season ended. A power rushing 
game replaces the inefﬁ  cient outside run-
ning by Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey.
A motion-based offense from Brent 
Pease replaces the vanilla system from 
former offensive coordinator Charlie 
Weis.

“This is a line of scrimmage 
league,” Muschamp said. “Gen-erally, your season is predicated 
on the quarterback position and 
both lines of scrimmage.”
The trenches will improve be-
cause of better quarterback play. 
An offense that moves the chains 
will keep the defense on the side-lines. Coupled with the Gillislee Express, Jacoby Brissett and Jeff 
Driskel will do just that.
Excluding blowout losses to 
Alabama and LSU, UF’s SEC de-
feats  were by an average of five points.
The Gators started a true 
freshman quarterback against SEC opponents. Brissett opened against LSU and Auburn.
“Going out there, we probably 
didn’t figure things out like the first seven series,” Brissett said. “You’ve just got to play the next 
play, and that’s what I learned.”
Comfort was an issue in the 
locker room and on the field for 
UF in 2011.
“I’m going to be much more 
confident just by knowing what to expect for [the defense] to throw at us and knowing what we’re going to give to them,” 
sophomore quarterback Jeff 
Driskel said.
The 2012 roster may look like 
a jumbled batch of unproven and underachieving talent, but the 
real mess is behind UF.
Contact Adam Pincus at apin-
cus@alligator.org.“He has some experience in 
the offense from spring on, and 
he’s a very bright kid,” Pease said of Murphy. “If he gets in a situation, he knows how to manage things.”
Pease said Mornhinweg, a 
Philadelphia native who de-committed from Penn State and was a late addition to UF’s recruiting class for 2012, has shown promise. Because Bris-sett and Driskel are both sopho-mores, Mornhinweg will have time to develop. 
“Skyler’s going to be a good 
quarterback here,” Pease said. “I think he’s still got some time to develop and I think we’re in that situation to continue to let him grow and prepare.”
What Brown Can Do for UF: 
There hasn’t been any doubt throughout fall practice that Mike Gillislee would be the starter at running back. The depth chart was more uncertain behind him, however, as sev-eral players battled for the No. 2 spot.
Redshirt sophomore Mack 
Brown is listed as the backup on the team’s first depth chart of the season.
Pease said that Brown, who 
has carried the ball just 15 times for 65 yards in two years, has improved several aspects of his game since 2011.
“I think Mack’s gotten bet-
ter,” Pease said. “He’s become a lot more confident and he’s def-initely got the ability. He’s im-proved his ball security. I think he’s learned more things within the offense. He understood that 
that’s one of the things he had 
to pick up. Be more consistent. ... He’s a good runner, but be 
more consistent in pass protec-
tion, catching the ball, the vari-
able of plays you’re going to 
carry in a game plan.”A&M Opener Postponed: Tex-
as A&M will now begin its sea-son on Sept. 8 when it welcomes Florida to College Station. The 
Aggies were supposed to kick 
off their season on Thursday night against Louisiana Tech in 
Shreveport, La., but their open-

make a decision.
“You just have to go with who’s 
moving the team,” Pease said. “The 
good thing about this is that they’re go-
ing to be in real game-time situations.”
Because Brissett and Driskel have 
been even throughout fall camp, coach-es believe either one can lead the team 
on the field.  
“In this circumstance, because of 
how they’ve both progressed and 
shown their leadership skills, I’m not re-
ally worried about it right now,” Pease 
said.
Ultimately, the coaches want to re-
ward the quarterbacks for progress made during training camp. Pease be-lieves each quarterback deserves legiti-mate playing time before a decision is made.
“They have both done a really good 
job, with how they’ve handled the situ-
ation and how they’ve progressed,” 
Pease said. “It would be difficult to say, to name a starter right now. What would 
you be telling the other kid?”
When the dust settles on Saturday , 
Florida might have its starting quarter -
back. Based on how fall camp has pro-
gressed, the competition could continue 
into next week.
Either way , only Muschamp knows. 
“At the end of the day , it’s not my 
decision,” Brissett said. “It’s the coach’s. Whatever he says, we have to go with.”

against Florida Gulf Coast on Saturday in the O’Connell Center.

Determining what Florida offensive coordinator Brent Pease’s offense 
will look like on Saturday has been a challenge for Bowling Green.  
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
With Noami Santos-Lamb hob-
bling on crutches, Florida’s freshmen 
have given the team a leg to stand 
on.
The class of 2016, led by Živa Re-
cek and Berkley Whaley, was instru-
mental in Florida’s trio of sweeps 
over the weekend. 
As a whole, the newcomers have 
totaled more than half of the team’s 
kills, aces and blocks.
If Santos-Lamb never suffered  an 
ACL tear on Aug. 18 during a scrim-mage, much of that production most likely would have come from her — not the freshmen.
“(Santos-Lamb) had an awesome 
spring and stayed here the entire summer,” coach Mary Wise said. “Really the last scrimmage before the Orange and Blue, she was lighting it 
up and was by far the best player on 
the court during that scrimmage. It’s disappointing for her, but it also cre-ates opportunity for other players to 
play in her absence.”
The injury to Santos-Lamb, a soph-
omore from Puerto Rico and the only 
returning outside hitter on the club, meant Wise had no choice but to rely 
on one of her five new outside hitters 
to step up.
But instead of choosing one from a group of many, Wise has been happy sprinkling several of Florida’s fresh faces into the rotation.
Three of the Gators’ top four at-
tackers are freshmen, as are three of the top six blockers.
After last year’s first three match-
es, no freshman even ranked in the 
top five in any offensive or defensive 
category.
“Looking back on the weekend, 
I don’t think we could be any more pleased with the production that our team came up with,” Wise said. “Es-pecially in terms of all that we were dealing with and trying out new line-
ups as late as Friday morning. We 
were still juggling that lineup trying to figure out what it was going to look like with the absence of Noami. 
The team responded better than we 
could have even asked for.”
When Santos-Lamb went down, 
Wise and the Gators didn’t have time on their side, either. Just six days after 
the injury, Florida opened its season 
at home against Florida Internation-al.
The freshmen had just six days to 
adjust to their new roles.
“They’re definitely adjusting great 
because a lot of girls, when they first come in, get caught up in not the volleyball part of it, but just the col-lege life in general,” Whaley said. 
“They’ve all adjusted really well. 
They know what our focus is, and that’s to win.”
Senior and captain Betsy Smith 
said it was that determination by the 
young players that helped the team 
get to 3-0, and that experience will help the squad as the year progress-es.
“We wanted three wins,” Smith 
said. “We wanted to get our lineups, we wanted to try and figure out how to play next to each other with a dif-ferent, young team. 
“Obviously there were some jitters 
for all of us. But they played through it and the three matches were big for us being able to get all that experience 
under our belt this weekend.”
As for Santos-Lamb, she will red-
shirt this season and have the chance 
to eventually play as a fifth-year se-nior.

� THE FALCONS WILL PLAY THEIR FIRST 
SEC TEAM SINCE 1996.

Bowling Green is not familiar with the South-
eastern Conference.
Head coach Dave Clawson has heard the mass-
es preach about the speed of SEC defenses, and 
watching the Gators on film has only confirmed what he’s heard.
“I was able to coach one year in the SEC and I 
can certainly attest that the defenses in that con-
ferences are different,” Clawson said. “Certainly 
on the defensive line with Florida … they’re out-
standing up front. You have some great players with (Sharrif) Floyd and (Dominique) Easley and (Omar) Hunter and (Dante) Fowler. … I just think 
the caliber of defensive lineman in that league is 
what separates the defenses apart from other con-ferences, and I think that is one of our greatest challenges going into this game.”
Bowling Green has not played a game against 
an SEC team since its 1996 season opener, when it lost 21-7 to Alabama. 
Bowling Green played Missouri four times and 
went 2-2 during that span, while the Tigers were 
still part of the Big 12.
Saturday’s matchup was scheduled when Ur -
ban Meyer decided to do a favor for the school that gave him his first head coaching job. 
With Florida in need of a nonconference op-
ponent, Meyer reached out to Clawson, and the 
chance to play in Gainesville was an offer the Fal-cons’ coach couldn’t turn down.
“This is a great opportunity for our program to 
play against one of the most historic and premier programs on a national stage, so these are oppor -
tunities we feel like we can never pass up.”Playing in a stadium as large as the Swamp 
will not be an unfamiliar experience for Bowling Green, and Clawson has done his best to replicate a gameday atmosphere in practice.
Two seasons ago, the Falcons traveled to Ann 
Arbor to take on the Wolverines in Michigan Sta-dium, which seats more than 100,000 people.
“There’s no way you can simulate that,” Claw-
son said of Saturdays at the Swamp. “We haven’t been able to get 100,000 people to come to Bowl-
ing Green and watch us practice and make noise. 
We’ve pumped in some sound, which isn’t the same. It’s certainly not going to vibrate the way it is down there.”
Defensively, the Falcons are preparing to deal 
with the Florida quarterback situation. Will Mus-champ said on Monday that either Jacoby Brissett or Jeff Driskel will play the first quarter of the opener, and the other will play the second. Flori-
da’s coaches will then evaluate their performances 
at halftime before deciding who will play the sec-ond half.
“One is more of a traditional pro-style,” Claw-
son said. “The other is a little more of a threat to run. They’re installing a new offensive system. I think they are going to ask both guys to run their system. Neither of them played a lot, so there’s not a ton of film on what they did a year ago.”
Clawson said he has known offensive coordi-
nator Brent Pease for nearly two decades, but said he doesn’t know exactly what to expect from UF offensively.
“There’s a little bit of a guessing game on what 
they’re going to do,” Clawson said of the Florida offense. “How much of it’s going to be Boise? How much have they incorporated from last year’s scheme? … I’m sure there’s going to be a lot to 
prepare for and there’s going to be a few wrinkles 
in there.”

UF volleyball captain �FORMER FLORIDA SWIMMERS 
EARNED 11 MEDALS IN LONDON.

At the 2012 London Olympics, coach 
Gregg Troy led the U.S. men’s swimming 
team to 16 medals, six of which came from athletes Troy coached at Florida. 
Team USA earned 31 medals in swim-
ming overall, including 11 from former Gators. 
The Gators accounted for nearly half 
of the swimming medals Team USA won, and Troy credited them for setting the pace for the rest of the Olympics, starting with former Gator Ryan Lochte.
“The first day we kind of set up things,” 
Troy said. “As a Gator, I was pretty proud of what we did. It set up everything for the team.” 
In London, Lochte earned two gold 
medals, two silvers and a bronze. Al-
though Lochte is now the second-most 
decorated American swimmer behind Mi-chael Phelps, he didn’t quite meet his ex-pectations.“Some of that is my fault,” Troy said. 
“We’re about being the best you can be, and he bit off a real big program. Most people wouldn’t even try it. It’s hardly a lack of success, but we fell a little short of what we thought we could do.”The former All-American had hoped to 
earn more golds and medal in all six of his events. 
One of the races in which Lochte came 
up short was the 4x100-meter relay, when he gave up the lead in the last leg to drop the team to a silver medal.
“We were kind of in a staff scenario 
that he was the guy we had to go to then,” Troy said. “That shook him a little. He was always the anchor here at Florida, and he never got beat, so it was a humbling expe-rience.”
After 11 Olympic medals, 41 World 
Championship medals and 10 years with Troy, Lochte is moving to California where he will prepare for the 2016 Olympics.
“He’s progressed to the point where he 
has all kinds of options, and the reality is 
things are much more available to him in 
a big city than they are in Gainesville, and the ideal place is on the west coast,” Troy 
said. 
“I’d love to continue to work with him. 
By the same token, from a growth stand-
point, he’ll progress a whole lot better if he has a little different experience.”
