The next time students try to use the UF-
mobile application, it will no longer be avail-
able.
After about 3 1/2 years of operation, 
the free UFmobile iPhone app shut down Wednesday.
Bryan Dubno, the creator of UFmobile, 
released the ﬁ  rst version of the app in Au-gust 2009. Since then, it has garnered a user base of about 34,000 people.
Following its release, UFmobile was used 
about two million times, said the 23-year-old ﬁ  fth-year computer science and engineering student. With so many people using the app, shutting it down may come as a surprise.
“Costs are piling up,” Dubno said. “It’s 
just getting to the point where I can’t really afford to keep supporting it — especially since the app is free.”
UFmobile was never ofﬁ  cially sponsored, 
endorsed or promoted by UF. Dubno said he had some trouble with the trademark, be-cause the app’s title includes the university name.However, UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said the university had nothing to do with the app.
The app featured a campus map students 
could sync with their schedules, a UF direc-tory, RTS information, an event calendar, a UF news feed, a live camera feed from the Southwest Recreation Center and a chat function that allowed students to interact with the UF community.
“Keep an eye out,” Dubno said. “I’m 
still trying to ﬁ  gure out some way that I can keep it alive. Hopefully, it’ll return in some form.” UFmobile developer shuts down popular iPhone app

Construction is underway on Heavener Hall, the 
new addition to the Warrington College of Business 
Administration.
The addition will be north of Bryan Hall, near the corner 
of Southwest 13th Street and University Avenue, and the college expects to break ground in April for undergraduate classrooms.
The construction and furniture move-in should be 
completed in Summer 2014, Howie Ferguson, the project manager, wrote in an email. 
But 21-year-old Elise Van Wie isn’t thrilled with the new 
addition.
Van Wie, a UF forest resources and 
conservation junior, is concerned about the number of trees that will have to be cut down for the new building. 
After she looked at an online map of the 
area, she said, she thinks about 100 trees will have to be cut down.
“Having two large buildings in that 
visible corner of campus will change the character of that area,” she said. “I don’t know for better or for worse, but I would like to see the trees stay.”
Van Wie said she plans to write a letter to UF President 
Bernie Machen to ask him to consider the environmental costs and impacts.
Van Wie said she is alone in trying to gain awareness 
about the trees for now.
“This is the ﬁ  rst time that I’ve taken the initiative in 
something like this,” she said. “Learning through my classes and what my professors are talking about, seeing something like this makes me want to apply what I’m learning.”
Ferguson said the exact quantity of trees that will have to 
be cut down is still being determined. Campus construction 
would cut down trees

BUILDING WILL COST LESS THAN A RENOVATION WOULD.

The abandoned Gainesville Po-
lice Department headquarters was 
demolished this morning as the ﬁ  rst step of the building’s recon-struction process.
The new facility will combine 
all of the department’s ofﬁ  ces on one campus and provide more space for day-to-day operations, GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobi-as said. It will be built in the park-ing lot of the old headquarters, 721 NW Sixth St.
Since 2010, Gainesville Police 
has worked out of satellite ofﬁ  ces scattered throughout the city after the department left the old build-ing because of spacing and age is-sues, Tobias said.Gainesville Police originally 
planned to renovate the former headquarters, he said. However, due to structural issues, planners decided to demolish the building and construct a new one because it would save money.
“You want to talk about people 
being excited about a building be-ing knocked down,” he said. “It’s real progress that we can see.”

tersection of Northwest Sixth Street and Northwest Eighth Avenue, consists of Gainesville Police’s ad-GPD headquarters to be demolished

The Gainesville Police 
Department and the City of 
Gainesville created a program to reduce traffic accidents on Southwest 62nd Street.
The Pedestrian High Visibility 
Enforcement Program aims to reduce the number of incidents between pedestrians and cars in the area, said GPD Spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
Since the program’s creation 
last week, GPD officers have issued more than 120 traffic citations, mostly to drivers who did not yield to pedestrians crossing Southwest 62nd Street near Southwest 20th Avenue, Tobias said.
The detail was funded by 
the Florida Department of Transportation.
It started Friday with an 
undercover officer monitoring a crosswalk near the Woodlands of Gainesville apartments, he said.
“We have identified a problem 
with drivers not paying attention specifically with this crosswalk,” he said.
If a car did not stop for 
the officer, he told additional uniformed officers in the area about the traffic violation via radio.According to Florida Law, 
drivers are required to yield to pedestrians as they cross the street.
Thirty traffic accidents have 
been reported in the Southwest 62nd Street area since Aug. 1, Tobias said. 
Earlier this month, Gainesville 
Police received reports of two traffic accidents on the same day, both involving pedestrians, he added.
Tobias said that the detail will 
happen at random twice a month, but he didn’t say for how long.
“There are no warnings given 
during these operations,” he said.
Residents of the Woodlands 
and The District on 62nd apartment complexes cross the street daily to and from nearby bus stops.
Ashley Lewis, a 22-year-old 
UF psychology senior, said a car once clipped her foot and sped off while she crossed the street.
“I thought he saw me,” she 
said. “Then I realized he wasn’t stopping.”
Emily Buchanan, a 21-year-old 
UF journalism junior, said she believes most drivers don’t stop because of the road’s set up.
Buchanan said she felt safer 
crossing the street with police present.
“Normally, I hesitate,” she 
said. “But I didn’t even have to, because cars were already stopping.”
Tobias said the detail will 
continue to change driving habits on the street and ensure drivers follow traffic laws.
“Our goal this year is zero 
traffic fatalities, and running details such as these will help us reach that goal,” Tobias said.

Pedestrians cross Southwest 62nd Street on Wednesday afternoon. Gainesville Police issued more than 
120 traffic citations near the crosswalk during the past two days, a majority of which went to drivers.
Police issue citations to drivers, pedestrians on Gainesville road
Thirty accidents were reported there latelyHe said three underground 
utilities have to run outside 
the building. Some trees will have to be removed anyway because they are in poor health.
UF Spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes said the location has been part of the university master plan as the future building site since 2005.
With about 4,000 students 
in the program, Sikes said the college needs space to focus on the undergraduate experience.
As for the trees, Sikes said 
the mitigation plans include replenishing the campus with twice as many trees than will be cut down.
Van Wie said replenishing 
trees is a step in the right direction, but she wasn’t sure if it outweighs the cost of removing the larger, historic ones.
“They are trying to take 
measures that will hopefully make up for it in the long run,” she said. “I’d say I respect them for that, and I think that it’s a noble effort.”
In addition, Van Wie is 
concerned with keeping the natural integrity and original aesthetic intact.
“You are going to walk 
around campus and see trees, but for how long? When do you stop building?” Van Wie said. “With our campus focusing on sustainability, preserving trees could be a cool step in that direction.”
However, Ferguson said 
the building’s exterior will be very traditional, keeping with the UF gothic style, while still being energy-efficient and sustainable.
The new building will 
strive for a Gold or Platinum 
LEED certification, which is a verification of green build-ings.
“Stopping the construction 
isn’t something that would 
happen,” Van Wie said. “But I think it’s important to get a voice out there to show there are people who care.”

The $10.9 million project will take a year
ministration building, a storage 
building, an evidence storage facil-ity and the abandoned headquar-ters, according to building plans presented to the Gainesville City Commission in April.
The new, estimated 
49,000-square-foot facility will include a two-story operations building, according to the plans. It will also include a training space, Tobias said.Administrative staff in the cur-
rent building will move into the new facility, Tobias said. He said he didn’t know which department divisions will occupy the current administrative building on North-west Eighth Street. The evidence storage facility will remain where it is.
The $10.9 million project is 
slated to take about a year, Tobias said. The budget is broken into four parts: $3.9 million from the initial city renovation pledge, $1.5 million from confiscated money, $2 million from a bond and $3.5 million from city reserves.
GPD Chief Tony Jones said the 
demolition is the official start of the project.
“The entire GPD staff has been 
waiting for this demolition to start,” he said. “It’s an amazing morale boost for the troops to see some measurable movement in the project.”

Gov. Rick Scott announced Tuesday 
that 11 state colleges have accepted a 
four-year, $10,000 tuition plan, which brings the total to 23 schools.
With the announcement, every state 
school that offers a bachelor’s degree in the Florida College System has commit-ted to Scott’s higher education affordabil-ity plan. 
He formed the plan to create more 
jobs and offer affordable higher educa-tion for state residents.
Santa Fe College was one of the first 
schools to support the plan. The college announced its participation shortly after Scott announced the initiative in Novem-ber.Jackson Sasser, SFC president, said he 
was enthusiastic about the program.
“We immediately endorsed it because 
it’s a symbol of Santa Fe’s desire to pro-vide access to students,” he said.
Sasser said SFC’s tuition ranges from 
about $11,000  to about $13,000 for the six bachelor’s degrees the college offers.
As part of the $10,000 plan, Sasser said 
the college will cut the cost of attendance by offering more online classes, recruit-ing more students with AP and dual-en-rollment credits and block tuition.
Sasser said that, with careful planning 
and financial management, meeting the $10,000 goal is a possibility for SFC.
“When you can get alignment be-
tween a governor’s office, an institute of higher learning and benefit students, it’s a good deal,” he said. Gov. Scott’s tuition plan gets

Sweet-toothed Gainesville res-
idents have had frozen yogurt, 
ice cream and gelato to choose from. But a new restaurant will give them a fourth option to set-tle their cravings.
SweetBerries Eatery & Frozen 
Custard, a family-owned restau-rant that specializes in frozen custards and homemade foods, will have its grand opening Fri-day.
The restaurant, 505 NW 13th St., is owned and managed by sisters Jane Osmond and Janice Easton.
Before Osmond followed her 
passion for food, she was a re-spiratory therapist for about 15 years.
She left her job to attend culi-
nary school.
SweetBerries was established 
15 years ago by Osmond and Eas-ton’s family. The Gainesville lo-cation will be the third restaurant in the state.
The restaurant replaces Books Inc. and Book Lover’s Cafe. The owners retired in January 2012, according to Alligator archives.
Although Osmond stressed 
the family aspect of SweetBer -
ries, she said the real story is the restaurant’s food, which is home-made and comes from years of family recipes.
“We’re not a chain,” she said. 
”We pride ourselves on quality, and we feel like we have a really good product.”
SweetBerries offers sandwich-
es, salads and soups along with frozen custards. One of the res-taurant’s signature desserts is its concretes, which are frozen cus-tards blended with fruits, nuts and other toppings.
Osmond said she looks for -
ward to doing business with UF students because her restaurant is close to campus.
However, Osmond said she 
faces the challenge of having in-gredients delivered to Gainesville from major food distribution companies in Orlando and Tam-pa.
She added that running the 
restaurant will be a new experi-ence for her and Easton.
“The biggest challenge is get-
ting over our learning curve,” Osmond said.
As for people who may be un-
sure about the new restaurant, Osmond said once they give it a try, they will be convinced.
“If they’ve never had fro-
zen custard, they’re going to be wowed — they will have a hard time going back to regular old ice cream,” she said.

64 TOTAL VOTESI’m side-eyeing you, Esquire magazine
Esquire has made some iffy creative decisions lately, es-
pecially when it decided to print what Vice Magazine labeled “The Worst Thing Ever Written” in the form of 
a proﬁ  le about Megan Fox by Esquire writer Stephen Marche, one of the authors of the publication’s entertainment section, the Culture Blog. What really bafﬂ  ed me was the Culture Blog’s recaps of episodes of HBO’s “Girls,” a show clearly not written to appeal to the Esquire demographic.
As expected, the Esquire recaps are eye-rollingly predict-
able because, surprise surprise, the middle-aged men who write the recaps don’t relate to the characters. And trust me, they’re eager to describe their inability to relate and how an-noying they ﬁ  nd each character.
David Curcurito, design director of Esquire (and owner 
of a trying-way-too-hard-Twitter bio that reads “Lover of Drinking, Driving, F-----g and Fighting”) wrote the recap of Sunday’s episode, “Bad Friends.”
“Everything men hate about the show ‘Girls’ I mostly 
hate too,” Curcurito wrote (probably while swigging from a bottle of Jack Daniels as he sped down the highway in a Lamborghini with a topless Kate Upton in the passenger seat — not). “The complexities of young women trying to ﬁ  nd their voice, who they are, and their intertwined friendships — blah, blah, ugh, give me a tampon and a pineapple drink in a martini glass.”
Cue a Liz Lemon over-the-top eye roll.  Is this really the best that Esquire has? Resorting to period 
jokes in the critique of a young female comedian’s TV series, in this age of lady comedy titans Tina Fey , Amy Poehler and Mindy Kaling?
I can only imagine how that thought process went: “What? 
Girl make joke? Girl??? With boob??? I am man. Only I make joke. Tampons.”
I’m confused as to why Esquire chooses to review “Girls,” 
a show designed to appeal to young women similar to the main characters. It’s topical and controversial, sure, but how many times can a few men make the same complaints about a show that’s not even written for them?
When was the last time you read a review of the “Die 
Hard” franchise in Cosmopolitan, or a serious critique of the Comedy Central show “Worka-holics” in Glamour? What’s next — “Mad Men” reviews in Nickel-odeon magazine? “Breaking Bad” recaps in Teen Vogue? What’s with this odd overlap?
This isn’t the ﬁ  rst time Esquire 
has inserted its unwanted mans-plaining on the topic of “Girls.”
In Marche’s proﬁ  le of Fox, he 
pulled what is arguably the most stupid statement in the whole history of the world to support his claim that “bomb-shells” like Fox “used to roam the cultural landscape like buf-falo, and like buffalo, they were edging toward extinction.”
“Women no longer need to be beautiful in order to ex-
press their talent,” Marche wrote. “Lena Dunham and Adele and Lady Gaga and Amy Adams are all perfectly plain, and they are all at the top of their ﬁ  eld.”
Based on this guy’s absurdly bold and misguided claims 
that all these women are “plain,” I had to ﬁ  nd him to see what he looks like.
I know, I know — I should be a bigger person and fo-
cus only on his shoddy writing, but I ﬁ  gured Marche had to be some kind of young, godlike Channing Tatum/Ryan Gosling/Donald Glover hybrid — but no. The guy calling Lady Gaga plain is a Canadian man in his late 30s with skin so transparent I can see the misogyny pumping through his veins.
Everyone has the right to an opinion — don’t get me 
wrong — but what is it about old dudes that cause them to have so many loud, mean opinions about young starlets?
And why do they get to decide what show 20-something-
year-old women should enjoy , or how female artists should look?
Esquire has the potential to be a great publication if it 
stops toeing the line between classy and crude. But this un-wanted intrusion on Judd Apatow’s best series since “Freaks and Geeks” is wholly unwanted.

Being a ‘hippie’ isn’t 
all bad
Sometimes, it’s admittedly easier to ignore a problem than to deal with it.
Maybe there are a bunch of problems with your car, but 
you don’t have the time or money to ﬁ  x them right now. Your front door’s been squeakin’ somethin’ ﬁ  erce, but you’ll get to it next week, for sure. Your clothes are deﬁ  nitely all neatly put away — in piles.
Odds are you do the same thing at the doctor’s ofﬁ  ce.You’ll start exercising for next year’s resolutions, right? Next 
time you’re at the grocery store, you’re totally going to pick up more veggies than fatty chips to munch on, if you remember. You didn’t mean to stay up an extra hour on Netﬂ  ix. Instead, you wanted to crawl into bed a little early to get a full eight hours of sleep, then wake up and drink, like, ten cups of water.
Stop not doing all of those things, and start doing them.They’re good for you! Even those annoying chores are good 
for you.
We’re not perfect beings. Pretty much everything we choose 
to do to our bodies is destructive in one way or another.
Instead of doing too many extreme things to our bodies, let’s 
choose to do good things to them. Like feeding it the right stuff as much as possible.
“Telling me to eat well and maybe exercise more? What is this 
editorial, my mother?” you might say before you ﬂ  ip to the page that has the crossword puzzle.
No, we’re not your mother. But we are about to advocate a 
vegetarian lifestyle. Hear us out, though.
A recent British study said that vegetarians “have about a 
third less risk of hospitalization or death from cardiovascular disease than meat-eaters do,” according a U.S. News article.
“Most of the difference in risk is probably caused by effects 
on cholesterol and blood pressure, and shows the important role of diet in the prevention of heart disease,” said Francesca Crowe, the lead researcher of the cancer epidemiology unit at the Uni-versity of Oxford, according to a Science Daily article. 
“Vegetarians typically had lower body mass indices (BMI) 
and fewer cases of diabetes as a result of their diets, although these were not found to signiﬁ  cantly affect the results,” the ar-ticle said.  
Obviously , you’re allowed to do whatever you want. You’re 
an adult, and that’s how living works. However, if you’ve been told to get a little more healthy recently, or you’ve been feeling sluggish, consider doing something about it.
Too many times do we, as a society , put something off until 
it’s too late.
Look at America’s gun control discussion. A lot of the rheto-
ric is asking why we waited so long to do anything about it.
The U.S. is the fattest country, according to www.nationmas-
ter.com. We also have the most crimes, and we’re ranked 18th in “math literacy.”
How are we supposed to live long and prosper if we don’t 
try to live long ﬁ  rst?
Do yourself a favor, and take a second to look at how you can 
take steps to improve your health. Then do ‘em.

From popping bottles of cham-
pagne in hotel rooms to showering 
gallons of Jameson Irish Whiskey on its manager’s head and a nightclub floor, electronic dance music trio Krewella has been making good on its guarantee to make fans wet, one song at a time.
The Chicago-based combo will 
play a sold-out show in Gainesville at The Florida Theater, 233 W Uni-versity Ave., as part of its “Get Wet or Die Trying” minitour.
Jahan Yousaf and Kris “Rain 
Man” Trindl first experimented with music production together in 2007, adding Yousaf’s younger sis-ter, Yasmine Yousaf, to the mix after she graduated from high school in 2010. Krewella picked up popular -
ity in 2012 after it released the single, “Killing It” and its first EP , “Play Hard,” which features hit tracks, “Feel Me” and “Come and Get It.”
We caught up with the band 
members on their nonstop cross-country party , which has been dubbed “Krewlife,” to talk about touring, raging and producing their new album.
Q: You released the single “Come 
and Get It” a couple of months ago. What direction is Krewella headed in with its new album?
A: “The writing that we are cur -
rently working on has more heart ... than our previous work. It is vulner -
able, honest and emotionally open. ... We want to share experiences that listeners can relate to, because music can be your best friend when you need a shoulder to 
lean on. However, we will never let go of our roots and our hunger for rage. The production in the works is sounding heavier than we’ve ever created. We get bored easily, so ex-pect a little bit of everything to keep you on your feet.”
Q: What has been the craziest 
experience you’ve had on tour since you put out “Play Hard”?
A: “...There are three of us that 
sometimes have strange experiences individually , but here are a few to put Krewlife in a nutshell: almost getting kidnapped in the ghetto of Puerto Rico by a cocaine dealer, missing flights, frat house fights, failed stage-dive attempts and trips to the ER, fire marshals crashing shows, Steve Angello getting Rain Man black-out drunk [and] strange sexual encounters.”
Q: You’ve sacrificed a lot to get 
Krewella this far. While touring, you’ve resorted to eating Cheetos for dinner, traveling all night and even getting sick a few times. How do you keep going?
A: “It’s the music, baby . If we 
had the same schedule but were selling cars or Mary Kay cosmetics, I think the lifestyle would catch up to us, and we’d be a mess. Playing shows truly does heal and numb any feelings of sickness and lack of sleep. Every few weeks, we schedule ourselves a little breaky, and having that to look forward to is very moti-vating.”
Q: It’s said that every tattoo has 
a story, and you all are no strangers to body art. Have you gotten any ri-diculous ink while on tour?
A: “The three of us were buzzed 
in L.A. one night and decided to spontaneously pop into a tattoo par -
lor to get tattoos and didn’t scope out the artists’ portfolios. Kris got ‘Rain Man’ on his inner lip, and now it just looks like he’s been chewing on ballpoint pens.”
Q: Final Question: What’s your 
opinion on frat tanks?
A: “Love ‘em. F--k sleeves. Get 
wet. Air the pits out.”

You will not catch John Mylott in a crowd 
of drunk Midtown bar patrons Saturday 
night.
You will not catch him drinking a can of 
Pabst Blue Ribbon beer before passing out on a couch.
According to a recent study, Mylott will 
sleep a lot better than those who do.
A new review of studies, published in  Al-
coholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, says that while alcohol does allow people to fall asleep faster, it disrupts rapid eye move-ment sleep.
According to the study, the more you 
drink before bed, the greater the REM sleep disruption. REM sleep happens about 90 min-utes after falling asleep. It is also the stage of sleep when people dream and it is thought to be restorative. Disruptions in REM sleep may cause daytime drowsiness and poor concen-tration.    
Mylott, a 20-year-old UF business admin-
istration senior, works at the Department of Recreational Sports as a wellness appraiser and personal trainer.
“If someone is saying that they’re drinking 
to fall asleep, I just think they’re trying to find another excuse to consume alcohol because there are safer and more beneficial ways to get yourself to fall asleep,” Mylott said.
When Mylott started college, he began to 
have trouble staying asleep. He then began to take a supplement called ZMA. Mylott said ZMA is a natural substance composed of zinc, magnesium and vitamin B6. As a powerlifter, Mylott takes the supplement after his work-outs to replenish minerals lost in the recovery process. It also enhances his REM sleep.
Mylott said drinking alcohol lowers tes-
tosterone while raising cortisol and estro-gen levels. The latter two hormones are the primary triggers of fat storage in the body. Alcohol will cause undigested food in your system to be absorbed as fat, instead of used as energy.
Maureen Miller is the director of UF’s Ga-
torWell Health Promotion Services. She said the study reiterates the same talking points she tells students in GatorWell’s on-campus health presentations. She also said most stu-dents are aware that drinking alcohol will not give them a deep sleep.
“Students have been hearing about this for 
a while,” Miller said. “But it’s always good to remind them even if they are aware of it.”
Miller said that limiting yourself to one 
drink per hour, along with drinking water, can help to regulate sleep quality.
Students can find more information on al-
cohol prevention, sleep and other health top-ics on the GatorWell website: gatorwell.ufsa.ufl.edu.New study shows drinking 
leads to disrupted sleep

Students in the College of 
Fine Arts at UF may not be 
able to create cat art in class, but that didn’t stop them from doing it outside the classroom.
“Just Cats” is exactly what 
it sounds like. It is an art show that nine art students created to display anything and everything cat-related, an opportunity to do some-thing fun and connect with other people who share com-mon interests.
“This is the opposite of 
what we would ever do in our classes,” said Dounia Bendris, a 20-year-old UF art junior. “It’s basically a gal-lery reception with different cat art from different art ma-jors.”
Bendris said she hopes 
the concept and theme of the show will encourage stu-dents to come and view art, and because it is “Just Cats,” it will create a more inviting atmosphere. 
If that isn’t enough, may-
be people will be attracted with the free food, she said.
The show is being held 
in association with the Re-itz Union Board Entertain-ment and can be viewed on the second floor of the Reitz Union in the gallery.
The artwork will be on dis-
play from Thursday through Feb. 18. The official opening of the show is during the gal-lery reception from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Feb. 7. 
At the reception, there 
will be food and drinks, and people will have the op-portunity to view different mediums of cat art and talk to the students who created them.
“A lot of our art will be 
conceptual in some way, and it’s such an open topic that relates to our culture. Our work is about the connection between cats and the Inter -
net and how we relate to that 
and how it reflects in s o c i e t y , ” said Zac Thompson, a 20-year-old UF art junior, who 
is one of the artists featured in the show.
He and eight others are 
creating works of art such as paintings, drawings, mixed media, photographs and sculptures to put on display in the gallery, some of which will be available for purchase the night of the reception.
“We’re going to have a 
contact list, so if you see anything that you want, you can contact the artist directly and figure out a price,” said Devin Kelly, a 20-year-old UF graphic design junior, who is also the director of the gallery.
Both the original pieces as 
well as prints will be avail-able for purchase.  
Thompson said he hopes 
this show will make people aware of what the gallery has to offer and will get people interested in viewing art and attending other art galleries on campus.

ITS WEBSITE IN CELEBRATION.

The fog-kissed air vibrated as the bass 
from the subwoofers melted into atmosphere 
through green and pink flaring lights, as it does every Saturday night at Spannk.
People lined up outside the door shoul-
der-to-shoulder take part in an underground dance movement and party Neon Liger-style.
The weekend social event is becoming 
more popular with each year, and this Sat-urday, it will kick off its five-year celebration party with all five residential disk jockeys be-hind the booth. Neon Liger will also relaunch its website, www.neonliger.com, with added features and online shopping options.
Neon Liger continues to set the bar for 
Gainesville nightlife, and for Vijay Seixas, founder of Neon Liger and part-owner of Spannk, it’s all about the music.
“You won’t hear what we play here 
anywhere else. We stick to the more under -
ground music because we like to introduce new stuff,” Seixas said. “Five years ago, there was no other electronic music nights going on, so we were doing it and had some under -
ground following, and now, it has become a lot more popular.”
Neon Liger’s MC, Will Newton, a UF 
alumnus, said, “It’s the best dance party that has ever existed. People come here to be themselves, and everyone has a really good time. The best dance music in Gainesville is right here, right now.”
There are 16 18-inch subwoofers that hit so 
hard the air itself vibrates. The sound waves 
tickle the inside of your chest as they pass through space.
Rodrigo Lizarraga, the 
graphic and web designer for Neon Liger, is not sat-isfied musically anywhere in town besides Saturday 
nights at Spannk. He is the person responsi-ble for creating the revamped website, which will unleash Saturday.
“The last Neon Liger website I designed 
was two years ago. The new website will be a lot more full-featured. One of the biggest additions is the merchandise store. And the website itself is going to have a brand-new design. It’s going to be a much larger web-site to accommodate the growing Neon Liger brand,” Lizarraga said.    
Seixas said the name Neon Liger was 
originally a joke between friends for the first party five years ago.
“Our friend had a cat that he called Liger. 
We were looking up party names when we first started, and there was a party in Miami called Neon Pony, so we just called it Neon Liger,” he said.
For the first hour, after the doors open at 
10 p.m., anyone 21 and up gets free beer, and if you RSVP on Facebook, there is no cover charge. After 11 p.m., there is a $5 cover.
After 5 years of partying, Neon Liger still rages on

Most thought the boy band 
craze would die out with dial-up 
Internet, Furbys and “Rugrats” in the ’90s.
But as long as there are girls 
to scream over dancing boys, the genre will always live on, said Michael DesRosiers, a 22-year-old UF biochemistry senior.
With the 2012 boy band resur -
gence, groups like One Direction and The Wanted helped the craze experience a revival.
Now, in 2013, iconic boy band 
New Kids On The Block has an-nounced its tour with two oth-er male-singing-and-dancing groups: Boyz II Men and 98 De-grees.
The summer tour, called “The Package Tour,” will follow the re-lease of New Kids On The Block’s new album,“10,” set to release April 2.
DesRosiers said ’90s bands, at 
their age, shouldn’t be on tour.
“The appeal 
of boy bands rests on the band members being boys, capable of stir -
ring up the 
hormones of pre-teen girls,” 
he said. “When older men try to do the same thing, that’s a little strange.”
Out of the three bands touring, 
Boyz II Men has still managed to stay around, with steady releases over the years, including a new CD released in 2011.
Justin Robinson, a 21-year-old 
UF recreation tourism and event management junior, said it’s be-cause Boyz II Men is timeless.
“They aren’t catchy little theme 
songs,” he said. “They have sub-stance to them — almost like a contemporary Temptations.”
He said he thinks Boyz II Men 
going back on tour is a good idea but wouldn’t go see them live un-less he was with a girl.
Evvy Struzynski, a 21-year-old 
UF public relations senior, said as a ’90s child, she was excited to hear about the tour.
“I wish it were Backstreet Boys 
and *NSYNC instead,” she said. “But I’ll take our generation’s boy bands over The Wanted any day.”
Tickets for “The Package 
Tour” go on sale Saturday on Ticketmaster.

Dear Friend,
It is completely with-
in your rights to ask for 
a ride home. Hope-fully you gave an equal or greater amount of pleasuring to your one-night-stand buddy. If this person is a jerk and lives too far away, ask a friend to pick you up. Avoid the bus on your walk-of-shame endeavor. I guarantee it will be one of the low-points of your life, but if you must, maybe you’ll get lucky and some-one will give you the 
slow clap.  Dear Mediocre 
Advice,
What is the morn-
ing-after protocol 
for sleeping over at a one-night-stand’s place if I didn’t drive?
Dear Mediocre 
Advice,
Why are freshmen 
so dumb? Were we that dumb? I hope 
not.
Dear Friend,
All of us were defi-
nitely that dumb once. 
It’s a good thing if you can admit it. Freshmen have yet to metaphori-cally s--t their pants about entering the real world. Freshman and sophomore years are spent carelessly. Ju-nior year is a little bit of a sweat with deciding what to do, but no wor-ries because there is still time to f--k around. Senior year is a whole world of denial, espe-cially if you think a fifth year is in the horizon. Basically, the amount of time in college is like running from the giant boulder in “Indi-ana Jones,” but in this version you actually die. You think you have time to run away, and for a short while you do, but in the end the boulder catches up to you. Then you end up moving back in with 
your parents.10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JANUARY 31, 2013

If disaster hit Gainesville, what 
would happen?
Written by Tom Sims and illus-
trated by Cincinnati K., the short 
story series “Elotchaway” explores life in a future Gainesville after a calamity has made the luxuries we have grown accustomed to useless.
“It’s not about a disaster, it’s 
about what happens after,” said Jim Chapin, 25, the editor of the “Elotch-away” series.
The story is on its fourth issue 
and is gaining local popularity due to its familiar setting.  
Scenes in the book take place on 
a warped Bo Diddley Community Plaza and a Gainesville Regional Utilities-like plant held together with wire and glue.“Elotchaway” can be ordered 
online at www.elotchawaystories.com and in locally owned busi-nesses, such as The Midnight Café 
and Bar, 223 S. Main St.; The Bull,  18 SW First Ave.; and inside Karma Cream, 1025 W. University Ave.
The lack of 
locally owned 
bookstores in Gainesville has driven the series to find an alternative in lo-cal cafes.
Chapin said the theme in “Elotch-
away” of lacking conventional means has lined up well with the way the story is being distributed.
“The story is about a failure of 
infrastructure and having to make your own alternatives,” Chapin said.Short story series depicts

In a night devoted to performance alone, the 
Screen Actors Guild Awards wasted no time in 
honoring the year’s top contenders.
What makes the SAG Awards so unique (and 
one of my favorite ceremonies) is that the actors vote for their fellow actors, making the year in cin-ema come full circle between their peers.
One of the best parts of the night comes at the 
beginning with the “I Am An Actor” monologues. Every year, select actors are chosen to face the cam-era and give a short speech, sometimes laughable and sometimes moving, about what made them become an actor. This year’s chosen performers included Jane Krakowski from “30 Rock,” Darren Criss from “Glee,” Helen Hunt from “The Sessions” and the legendary Hal Holbrook.
Even better? There were some (gasp!) upsets 
in prominent categories. The BBC hit “Downton Abbey” took the statue for Outstanding Perfor -
mance for an Ensemble in a Drama Series, besting the likes of “Mad Men” and “Boardwalk Empire.” “Silver Linings Playbook” star Jennifer Lawrence bested Jessica Chastain in “Zero Dark Thirty” for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role; tripping her way up to the stage, she recalled first receiving her SAG card — from an epi-sode of MTV’s “My Super Sweet Sixteen.”
Some categories went to the front runners set by 
the Golden Globes, including Anne Hathaway in “Les Mis-erables” for Outstanding Per -
formance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role and Daniel Day-Lewis in “Lincoln” nab-bing the Lead Actor win. TV wins included Female Actor in a Drama Series Claire Danes for “Homeland” and the cast of “Modern Family” for En-semble in a Comedy Series.
The legendary Dick Van Dyke received a life-
time achievement award. Van Dyke’s undeniably grateful demeanor made for a sweet highlight.
Capping the night off with the Outstanding Per -
formance by a Cast in a Motion Picture award was “Argo,” which has been notably snubbed this sea-son by the Academy for director/star Ben Affleck.
Many of the speeches of the night were more 
heartfelt and meaningful than the rest because it was actors thanking actors, the people they work with and the people who’ve inspired them.

The Florida women’s tennis 
team won its 24th consecutive dual 
match in a 7-0 victory against UCF on Wednesday afternoon at Linder Stadium. 
But the Gators’ win got off to a 
rocky start. 
Junior Olivia Janowicz and 
freshman Danielle Collins took on the Knights’ Genevieve Lorbergs and Josephine Haraldson on Court 1 in doubles. 
Lorbergs and Haraldson quickly 
took a 5-2 lead. An array of drop shots and returns into the net proved costly for Janowicz and Col-lins. On one point, Collins lost her balance, fell and tried to snag the ball with her left hand.
The errors proved too much for 
UF to overcome as Haraldson and Lorbergs sealed an 8-3 victory. 
H o w e v e r , 
Florida overcame Janowicz and Collins’ defeat, taking two of three matches to claim the doubles point.
“It was a dif-
ficult day to play 
with the wind,”  coach Roland Thornqvist said in a release. “We struggled a little bit in doubles at the beginning, but once we figured out that it wasn’t going to be a per -
fect day to play, then we settled down.”
In singles play, the Gators put 
the Knights away.
Sofie Oyen and Lorbergs played 
the most competitive match, ex-changing the lead back and forth. Oyen ultimately prevailed, taking the first set 7-5 and holding on to win the second 6-3.
Collins and Janowicz both got 
revenge for their doubles defeat but in different fashions. Collins defeated Haraldson in straight sets 6-0, 6-0.  
Janowicz battled back from a 3-1 
deficit to win the first set 6-3 before putting Caroline Eberhart away 6-2 in the second set.
After jumping out to an early 
lead, Morgan controlled the pace of her match, dropping only one game in each set of her victory against Sofie Baptista.
Caroline Hitimana trailed at the 
start of each set of her singles match against Clare Mendell. After falling behind 3-0 in the first set, she battled back by winning six straight games. Mendell stole the first game of the second set but fell to Hitimana 6-2. 
Alexandra Cercone controlled 
her match in a 6-2, 6-2 win against Jenna Doerfler.UF bounces 
back from slow start in win vs. UCF

  Florida has smothered its South-
eastern Conference opponents this 
season, but delivered its biggest trouncing against South Carolina. 
  The No. 4 Gators (17-2, 7-0 SEC) 
held the Gamecocks to 31.1 percent shooting and forced 17 turnovers en route to a 75-36 victory on Wednes-day night in the O’Connell Center.
  The 39-point win is UF’s largest 
margin of victory in SEC play . South Carolina’s 36 points are the second-fewest Florida has allowed this sea-son.
“Every time they tried to run a 
play , we kind of beat them to the step,” senior guard Kenny Boynton said. “We beat them to a spot, and that kind of messed up their plays. They didn’t know what to do.”  
  The Gators held the Gamecocks 
(12-8, 2-5 SEC) to 3-of-21 shooting in the ﬁ  rst half. Florida’s full-court press shook South Carolina early , committing nine turnovers in the ﬁ  rst 10 minutes. Overall, UF scored 22 points off of turnovers. 
“We did a good job of when the 
ball came inbounds waiting and be-ing patient,” coach Billy Donovan said. “When the ball probably got right above the top-of-the-key area, we were able to kind of trap, rotate and take away the next available pass.”  
  Mike Rosario and Boynton each 
ﬁ  nished with 15 points on a com-bined 11-of-22 shooting. Boynton tallied a season-best seven assists. 
  Freshman guard Michael Frazier 
II added 12 points, burying 4 of his 6 three-point attempts. 
  After shooting 2 of 6 from the 
ﬁ  eld during the ﬁ  rst 5 minutes, the Gators went on a 16-4 run to in-crease their advantage to 21-4 with 10:12 remaining in the ﬁ  rst half.  
  Florida’s most dynamic defen-
sive play came from junior center Patric Young with 1:45 remaining in the ﬁ  rst half. As South Carolina’s Eric Smith drove into the lane for a layup attempt, Young swatted the ball off the backboard. 
  Young’s rejection led to a fast-
break dunk by Rosario on the other end. The redshirt senior was called for a technical foul after the play for hanging on the rim. 
“If I were to let go at that mo-
ment, I would have slipped and hurt myself,” Rosario said. “The ref told me on the second swing, he had to give me a technical foul. I was like, ‘OK. Just know that I have [Dono-van] on my butt now.’”

  With 1:28 remaining in the ﬁ  rst half 
on Thursday, Ole Miss guard Diara 
Moore connected on a three-point ﬁ  eld goal to extend the Rebels’ lead against the Gators to 50-33. 
  Moore’s three was the ninth by Ole 
Miss in the opening half. The Rebels shot 11 of 16 from behind the arc in an 88-81 victory, their ﬁ  rst Southeastern Conference win of the season. 
  After the game, UF coach Amanda 
Butler expressed her displeasure with Florida catching Ole Miss on perhaps its best shooting night of the year. The Reb-els had not shot better than 50 percent from three-point range prior to shoot-ing 68.8 percent against the Gators.
  “Clearly, we didn’t have everybody 
on their team pegged as a shooter,” But-ler said. “But it didn’t really matter who was behind the three-point line tonight. Everything they put up fell.”   Ole Miss’ success continued a trend: 
UF’s three-point defense has been dis-mal this season.
  Florida has allowed opponents to 
shoot 32.3 percent from behind the arc this year, which is 12th in the confer-
ence and 256th in the nation. In SEC play, opponents are shooting 38.1 percent from 
three-point range, leaving Florida’s de-fense at 13th in the conference.
  “It certainly has been a weakness 
for us,” Butler said. “We’ve deﬁ  nitely struggled with awareness — not just who the hot shooter is, but where is she.”
  Through seven conference games, 
opponents have made 45 of 118 tries against the Gators. Butler has pointed to Florida’s failure to guard the three-point line as the central factor in its poor  UF struggles defending arcJURNY DUTY
  On Fridays and Saturdays, Kevin 
O’Sullivan doesn’t have much to worry about.
  The Florida coach has two established 
starting pitchers in juniors Jonathon Craw-ford and Karsten Whitson.
  Following a promising freshman season, 
Whitson tailed off in his sophomore cam-paign.
After being hampered by a lingering 
groin injury in the fall of 2011, he was be-hind the curve from the get-go in 2012.
  But by all accounts, he is back to his old 
form and ready to assume one of the top spots in the Gators’ rotation.
  Crawford, unlike Whitson, pitched the 
best ball of his career last year after throw-ing just 3.2 innings as a freshman. In 77.2 innings, Crawford recorded 73 strikeouts with a 3.13 ERA in 2012. He also threw Florida’s ﬁ  rst no-hitter since 1991 in its NCAA Regional opener against Bethune-Cookman.
  The third spot in the rotation? For the 
ﬁ  rst time in many years, it’s up for grabs.   In 2012, the 
Gators returned their top three starters from the previous season — Whitson, Hudson Randall and Brian Johnson. Randall and Johnson were already mainstays in the rotation prior to the 2011 season, and the highly touted Whitson won a weekend spot early on. But even if Whitson disappointed as a fresh-man, O’Sullivan had Alex Panteliodis, who started 26 games between 2009 and 2010, ready to step in.
  Florida does not have that same pitching 
depth, as a reloaded roster prepares for the 2013 season. 
  Sophomores Corey Stump and Johnny 
Magliozzi and junior Keenan Kish are can-didates for the job.
Magliozzi is the only pitcher, aside from  Florida needs lefty in rotationSEE HOOPS, PAGE 16

has made more than two ca-reer starts.
Stump is, by far, the least 
experienced of the group with just four career innings pitched, but he should still be the one taking the mound on Sundays. 
Stump should get the nod 
because, unlike Magliozzi, Whitson, Kish and Craw-ford, he is a lefty. The Gators are going to face teams that have multiple good left-handed hitters. Ideally, Flor -
ida would like to neutralize a lefty-heavy team with a southpaw at least once per weekend. 
While he didn’t get on the 
field much in 2012, Stump has the pedigree to warrant a shot in the weekend rota-tion. 
Prior to his freshman sea-
son, Stump was ranked as the No. 1 Top Prospect in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League by Perfect Game and was the fifth-ranked pros-pect in the country by Base-ball America.
The 6-foot-5 Stump al-
lowed one earned run in four innings in 2012.
His repertoire includes 
a fastball, a curveball and a changeup. 
The sample size for 
Stump at the collegiate level is admittedly small, but that doesn’t mean O’Sullivan shouldn’t give him a shot in non-conference play. In ad-dition to the other possible third starters, Florida has Daniel Gibson, Ryan Har -
ris and Bobby Poyner in the bullpen to relieve Stump if he were to look shaky. 
But the first couple of se-
ries would provide the best opportunity to test Stump as a starter.
Florida opens against 
Duke, which finished last season with a record of 21-34. Their second weekend series is against Florida Gulf Coast, which also ended last season worse than .500.
The track record might 
not be there, but the Gators should give Corey Stump a chance to give them the left-handed presence they’ve had in the rotation in each of the previous four seasons — all of which ended with at least 42 wins.

JOSH , from page 15 Florida opened second half on 13-3 run
a 33-10 lead and opened the second 
half on a 13-3 run. 
Florida shot 52.8 percent from 
the field and boasted a 12-of-21 clip from three-point range. UF made only 7 of 16 free throws and did not attempt a shot from the charity stripe in the second half. 
Against the Gamecocks, the 
fourth-best offensive rebounding team in the conference entering Wednesday , the Gators won the rebounding battle 38-24. Florida grabbed 11 offensive boards to South Carolina’s six. 
Junior forward Casey Prather re-
turned to the lineup for the first time 
s i n c e suffering a high left ankle 
sprain during the first half of UF’s 74-52 win against LSU on Jan. 12. Prather checked into the game with 11:39 remaining. In 3 minutes, he pulled down two boards and scored two points.
After a perfect January , the 
Gators are riding a nine-game win-ning streak heading into a match-up against No. 16 Ole Miss (17-3, 6-1 SEC) on Saturday night in the O’Connell Center.  
“The more you win like this, the 
more you show (what) you’re capa-ble of,” Donovan said.
“You have to understand that the 
No. 1 priority is getting better. … All of this other stuff doesn’t mean any-thing.”
UF shooting 29.3 percent from three
performance. The team is currently tied for eighth in 
the SEC.
Florida will look to tighten up its three-point de-
fense when it travels to Columbia, Mo., to face Missouri tonight at 8. 
Missouri ranks fourth in the SEC with a 33.7 three-
point percentage this season. Sophomore Morgan Eye paces the SEC with 3.8 three-pointers per game on 43.2 percent shooting. 
“Everyone (on Missouri) can shoot,” redshirt fresh-
man Carlie Needles said. “We have to guard everybody as a shooter. It doesn’t matter if it is Eye or their point guard or anyone else.”
Eye has drilled 80 of her 185 attempts. The 5-foot-
9 guard has attempted 21 more threes than any other player in the SEC and averages 4.3 tries per contest against conference foes.  
“She shoots the ball great,” Butler said. “She’s tall. 
She really understands how to get her shots within their offense. She knows how she is going to be played and still finds ways to create space.”
Missouri’s three-point prowess starkly contrasts to 
the Gators’ abysmal effort from behind the arc. Florida has made just 29.3 percent of its 331 attempts.
In conference play, the Gators have been even 
worse. UF is 22 of 87 from three-point range, a 25.3 per -
cent rate that places it 13th in the conference. 
Eye and Alabama guard Shafontaye Myers have 
each hit more threes in SEC play than the entire Gators squad. 
“We’re a very good team that can score in a lot of 
different ways,” Butler said. “Right now, the three-point line is not one of those ways.”
