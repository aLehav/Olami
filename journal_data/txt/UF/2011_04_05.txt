ATLANTA — Federal prosecutors say a 
Georgia man accused of making more than 
$1 million from the sale of fake vintage hor -
ror movie posters has found another way to continue his scheme.
Kerry Haggard, was released on 
$100,000 bail after he was arrested in April 2010 on mail fraud charges.
But U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said 
in a letter filed Monday that Haggard has since recruited someone to sell 81 posters and other items on his behalf, defying a court order. He urged the judge to revoke Haggard’s bail and issue a warrant for his arrest.
Prosecutors say Haggard sold fake re-
productions from movies such as “Franken-stein” for $500 to $5,000, bilking victims of more than $1 million over a four-year span.
A message left with Haggard’s lawyer 
was not immediately returned.

n STUDENT TICKETS WILL COST $15 
PER GAME STARTING THIS FALL.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Staff Writer
The Gators have a new coach, different 
play-calling scheme and an overall fresh 
look. 
Fans, on the other hand, will have a high-
er price to pay for football tickets this season 
and beyond. 
The University Athletic Association’s 
Board of Directors approved a five-dollar-per-game increase on its season ticket pack-
ages, jacking the price for a student package up from $70 to $105.
Byron Logan, a UF student, said he 
thought the price increase was unreasonable. 
“Considering we lost our coach and our 
team doesn’t seem that good anymore, I re-ally don’t understand what the increase is for,” he said, referring to last season when the 
Gators went 8-5 and lost head coach Urban 
Meyer.
The increase, however, had less to do with 
the team’s on-field performance as it did with other factors, said Mark Gajda, assistant athletics director of ticket operations. The in-crease had been scheduled well in advance of Muschamp’s hire. 
It’s been about five years, Gajda said, since 
the price of  student tickets has increased.
After researching ticket prices around the 
country, the UAA realized its prices were lower than other BCS-conference schools and felt it would be justified in raising 
them, he said.
The increases are expected to generate 
$3.1 million  in revenue for the UAA, which is currently working to subsidize upstart sports like lacrosse, he said.
Despite what comes out to to be a 50 per -cent increase in ticket prices, students still get a pretty good deal compared to the folks across the field. For faculty, alumni and fans, a set of season tickets costs $259. This is in ad-dition to booster fees, which can range any-where to $250 to $15,000, Gajda said. 
Not all students are opposed to the new 
ticket prices.
 Scott Hendel said he thought the price 
change was not a big deal and said he would be more than happy to pay more should he win the ticket lottery.
“It’s like if a woman buys a $1,000 wed-
ding dress,” he asked, “is she going to care if she buys a $100 pair of shoes to go with it?” Student football ticket prices to increase

“Let me show you how my mind 
works,” says the 20-year-old.
He pulls out a piece of paper 
and replicates a pattern he discov-ered in the bathroom. Every tile in 
the bathroom alternates colors, so 
Michael Rodeman fills in some of the squares on the paper and leaves some blank. 
Soon, he draws varying sizes 
of squares. With a 2-by-2 or 3-by-3 square, there are two options for the color arrangement. But once you reach a 4-by-4 square you’ve 
reached the maximum of four op-
tions; any more tiles per side won’t affect the pattern.
It’s not a meaningful problem. 
The solution won’t send astronauts to Mars, but it’s what Rodeman does. He solves problems — even on the toilet.
Rodeman, a math sophomore at 
UF who prefers magic and juggling to partying and drinking, defied the homeless background he came from to become a 4.0 GPA-bearing, na-tional-math-contest winning college student with the potential to solve the world’s problems.
Ever since he figured out multi-
plication tables in fourth grade, math 
is everything Rodeman has done. 
During his sophomore year at 
Middleton High School in Tampa, 
about the time that his family was bouncing around from friend’s house to friend’s house, even living 
in a hotel at one point, his geometry 
teacher persuaded him to join the math team.
According to Chris Lawyer, his 
calculus teacher at Middleton, Rode-man became a sort of mascot or class clown on the team. 
His mom, Susan Rodeman, told 
everyone who visited wherever they were living that Rodeman was a genius. 
The family didn’t have much — 
the only food they could afford to buy were pancakes.
“I always heard the school 
meals were crap. 
I always thought those people were ungrateful,” he said. “I was like, ‘This is the 
best thing I ever 
tasted!’”
Despite the 
hard times, his 
mom and dad, Thomas, picked him up from after-school math practices. On Jan. 10, 2007, at 4:30 p.m. —  Ro-deman spouted the date and time as soon as he was asked — Susan was 
driving with her husband to pick 
their son up from a mid-week prac-tice when she died of a heart attack caused by stress. 
Her heart failed, her son said, 
because she wasn’t able to give her children what she wanted for them.Math whiz has mind

ENVIRONMENT
By ALLISON BANKO
Alligator Writer 
The Gators’ green agenda has propelled them to 
a clean No. 1 spot. 
UF ranked as the top school on the Roberts En-
vironmental Center’s sustainability reporting of the 
top U.S. universities. 
Undergraduates of California’s Claremont McK-
enna College scanned universities’ websites, includ-
ing Brown, Yale and Duke, for criteria pertaining to 
social and environmental issues. Information was then compiled into PDF files, which were divided into sustainability categories to see how many the 
university covered. 
According to center director Emil Morhardt, UF 
had about 800 pages that fit the eco-friendly sub-
jects including food and recycling, waste, water use and green building. 
Green building was an area that researchers no-
ticed has been a growing trend at universities. 
UF has implemented what is known as LEED, or 
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, in 
its construction over the years, most recently in the 
remodeling of the Southwest Recreation Center. 
RDG Planning and Design’s Al Oberlander, who 
was the principal on the Southwest project, said the low-energy materials used for the renovation came 
from within a 500-mile radius of campus to cut 
down on transportation energy. 
Oberlander also noted other environmentally 
friendly features such as the gym’s electricity, which 
is generated in part by the elliptical machines as students work out on them. 
“It’s very unique,” Oberlander said. “There 
aren’t a lot of campuses around the country that are doing that.”
He said UF was one of the first advocates of sus-
tainability and the university has a lot of strong ad-
vocates for the cause. 
The UF Office of Sustainability is a fixture that 
has especially complemented the campus’s efforts by making strides to reduce carbon emissions, fo-cusing on locally grown produce and partnering with campus organizations to spread sustainability 
education. 
Though Florida was at the top spot in the report, 
edging out Georgetown and University of Southern 
California, Morhardt said sustainability as a whole 
has improved dramatically in the past five years in 
the realm of universities, and much of it has to do with the increasing concern from students. 
“If a student body makes awareness of some-
thing, that’s been known to have a profound effect,” 
he said. “Any given [institution] can have its whole 
behavior changed by one person deciding some-thing is really important.” UF gets No. 1 ranking in sustainability report

RDG Planning and Design, principal of Southwest 
projectTOP 25 SUSTAINABLE SCHOOLSn CATHY DEWITT WILL PERFORM WITH HER 
BAND, PATCHWORK, THIS WEEKEND AT THE 
SANTA FE COLLEGE SPRING ARTS FESTIVAL.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Writer
For Cathy DeWitt, music makes everything in life better.
It has brought her a husband, a career and a calling. It 
has sent her as far as London and as close as downtown Gainesville. The closer, the better, she said.
DeWitt, a UF alumna, will bring that music to Gainesville 
on Sunday when her band, Patchwork, performs at the San-ta Fe College Spring Arts Festival in the downtown historic district. 
Patchwork, a folk band that sings of its love of Florida 
and cowgirl icons, was woven from the pieces of other bands.
Over the years, the bands have changed, but DeWitt’s 
two loves, music and Gainesville, have remained.
Most of the band members had played with each other 
before. If they weren’t already friends, they became so.
“This whole Gainesville music scene, I have a name for 
it,” said DeWitt, who sings in the band and plays guitar and 
piano on the side. “It’s platonic incest.”
DeWitt joined Patchwork with two friends who previ-ously sang doo-wop backup vocals in a rhythm-and-blues 
band while she played piano.
She met her husband, Rob, through the band. He was 
a drummer, and he insisted that DeWitt audition for him before she could join.
She was single at the time, and she said she didn’t have 
much to go home to. 
She spent late nights at restaurants with Rob instead.“I started to like him,” she said.They were together for eight years before they got mar -
ried 17 years ago. He helps produce DeWitt’s CDs and pre-
pare for her shows.
It’s a fringe benefit, she said jokingly.
She said she didn’t learn music at school. As the daughter of a St. Petersburg Times employee and 
an English teacher, she grew up helping her mother grade 
creative writing papers. She graduated from UF in the 1970s 
with a journalism degree.
Music is in her blood. Her father was also a New Orleans 
jazz musician before DeWitt’s mom made him get “a real 
job,” she said.
And writing hasn’t strayed far from her heart. She writes 
song lyrics and has won awards for songwriting, includ-
ing two from the 2006 Unisong International Songwriting Contest.
When she isn’t on stage, she’s singing at Shands at UF. 
She plays for the patients. She said it helps them.
On her first day at the Arts in Medicine program, DeWitt 
sang as her friend strummed a banjo, unsure of what would 
happen. 
Parents wheeled their children from the hospital rooms, 
IV poles in tow, following the sound of the twanging notes.
She said the kids laughed and danced as much as their 
bodies could manage.
She has worked there for 16 years and considers it the 
most positive way to use music.
Another time she went into a young boy’s room and 
found him in his bed, curled in pain.
His mother asked DeWitt to watch him so she could find 
a nurse to give him more pain medicine.
DeWitt went up to him with a handheld harp. She began 
to strum it for him. 
“Would you like to try it?” she asked him.
He sat up and, without saying a word, strummed the 
harp slowly and softly for 10 minutes.
“He forgot about his pain,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, APRIL 5, 2011

SUSTAINABILITY
By JESSICA KRAMER
Alligator Contributing Writer 
When walking by Midtown, 
something might strike you as a 
little odd.
There are still the bars and the 
restaurants, the street parking and 
the bookstore, but on West Univer -
sity Avenue, a large black recep-tacle stands out.
A solar compactor, strategically 
placed in this high-traffic area, should save the City of Gainesville 
enough money to bring the com-
pactors on campus.
“It was a project we’ve been 
working on for a while,” said Stan-
ley Estes, the solid waste field op-
erations supervisor for the City of Gainesville.
The compactors have the capac-
ity of five traditional trash cans, 
and their cost ranges from $3,000 to 
$4,000 depending on the volume of the container.
According to solarpanelspower.
net, when the container reaches a predetermined level of waste, a sensor is triggered and the waste is compacted using 100 percent solar energy.
The solar compactor was pur -
chased by the city from BigBelly Solar, a company that started the release of the container in 2005. 
Robert Dalton, the director of 
business development for BigBelly Solar, said the company has more than 125 college and university customers.
BigBelly Solar hopes that pur -
poseful positioning of the trash receptacles will intrigue passersby and cause them to become more involved in the disposal of their waste.“As opposed to an open-lid con-
tainer, with the BigBelly you have to open the top,” Dalton said. “You’re 
essentially forcing community in-
teraction, which requires thought, right?” he said. “The individual thinks about what they’re doing. 
You have to walk up to it; you can’t 
just walk by it.”
The payback period, according 
to BigBelly Solar, is about three years, but Estes said the City of 
Gainesville is on a much shorter 
schedule. 
 “We’re looking at one year for 
a payoff,” Estes said. “At this time, 
there is no plan for any [on cam-
pus] right now. We’re first trying to study them and see how efficient they are.”
Four other containers have been 
placed around Gainesville, includ-ing one on Main Street, one on 13th Street, one behind Oaks Mall and one behind Butler Plaza.
 “Institutions want to be able to 
take that reduction in waste collec-tion and move those newly formed hours to more tasks, especially to tasks on campus,” he said.City tests solar-powered trash cans

Rodeman gained an interest in political activism when he came to UF
“I’ve never seen my dad cry before, but 
he said he cried,” Rodeman said. “I’ve never, 
never seen him cry.”
Rodeman, who was 16 at the time, poured 
himself into his math textbooks. In addition to the Monday team meetings and the ever-increasing mound of college applications, he continued to press forward with his studies. 
In his application essay to the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, according to the St. Petersburg Times, he wrote math was his way of coping with his loss.
Mu Alpha Theta, the national math compe-
tition organization, keeps tests used in previ-
ous competitions. In his categories, Rodeman 
took every historic practice test — about a thousand tests in total. 
“He’d talk about math sometimes,” Law-
yer said, “but he just didn’t have normal hu-man conversation, like weather or sports or anything. Sometimes, if he was around a lot of strangers, he’d kind of bottle up.”
He won first place in his division at a re-
gional math competition the fall of 2007, which is when the St. Petersburg Times first published a story about Rodeman’s success at the competition despite his family’s poverty and his mother’s death.
His senior year of high school, he won first place in the nation for a geometry category and second place for a calculus category.
When applying to college, four application 
fees were waived, so he planned it logically:
One in-state university he knew he would 
get into: the University of South Florida.
One in-state university that had a nice pro-
gram: the University of Florida.
One out-of-state university that had a nice 
program: Georgia Institute of Technology.
And one dream school: MIT.He was accepted to all of them but MIT. 
Yale University even sent him a letter, he said, asking him to apply, but he couldn’t afford the pricey application fee.
So he came to UF.
His freshman year, he found a juggling 
club, a magic club and a math club.
But outside of club meetings and events, 
he spent at least three hours a day doing 
non-class-related math work, just things that piqued his interest, things like making pat-terns out of bathroom tiles.
At UF, he can eat three meals a day through 
the meal plan provided by financial aid.
In his freshman year, he added a minor in 
astronomy . He loves Carl Sagan, outer space, stars, and black holes. 
And as he struggles with the big issues of 
life, he added another minor this past semes-ter, this one in philosophy.Rodeman was never political in high school, 
Lawyer said. He was still surprised that Rode-man was a part of the protests against the In-
ternational Burn a Koran Day at Dove World 
Outreach on Sept. 11.
After that day, Rodeman joined the Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society, participating in petitions and rallies like the Anti-Police Bru-tality Rally on March 2.
At SDS meetings, he doesn’t speak up. He 
usually just nods in agreement.
Since the Quran burning protest, Rodeman 
has attended all of the Monday SDS meetings. He stumped for the Progress Party . He even 
accepted fellow SDS member Jer -
emiah Tattersall’s offer to join a book club that was reading Karl Marx’s “Das Kapital,” although 
he doesn’t necessarily agree with the book’s te-nets. And as if the 1,152 pages weren’t enough, Rodeman decided to buy a commentary , and 
he has not only kept up with the reading, but 
he’s also watched video lectures on each of the chapters. 
But still, amid the petitioning, picketing 
and philosophizing, he tries to solve the math questions of his universe.
A few weeks ago, he noticed  there were 
barriers that bottle-necked one of the side-walk’s traffic, so he stopped walking and pon-
dered. He viewed the sidewalk traffic through the lens of differential equation and started to 
figure out what sets of data he would need to determine how much people slow down when they walk through the barriers and how much they speed up once they’re past the barriers.
There’s no equation to explain why he 
loves solving problems; he just does. 
But maybe part of that mind can never ac-
tually turn off.
When Rodeman collected petitions for un-
derpaid tomato pickers, he counted the names. There were 1,511 names.
“Hmm, I wonder,” he thought, “if that’s a 
prime number.”
So he calculated in his head;  it was, in fact, 
a prime number.
Rodeman is the type of person who, despite 
his excitement, prefers to let others do the talk-ing. In class, he usually just takes notes.
Even though he prefers being quiet, he 
loves political activism and philosophy , which he said
“I think it’s close to math because you have 
to be logical,” he said of philosophy. “But that’s the only thing in philosophy that’s also 
in math, logic.”
But there has to be more than just that. 
What about the meaning of life?
 “I have no idea,” he said laughing before 
figuring out the answer. “Forty-two. That’s 
the purpose of life.”

Today’s question: Will the 
increase ticket price deter you from entering the football lottery?Monday’s question: Did you participate in Dance Marathon?
13% YES87% NO
60 TOTAL VOTESTime Out
Students shouldn’t 
complain about price
As many of you have discovered, the price for stu-
dent season tickets to Gators football games has in-creased for the 2011 season. The price has jumped 
from $70 to $105, an increase of 50 percent that has some students reeling. But before you complain about the change, keep a few things in mind.
First, remember that student season ticket holders will 
pay $15 per game. That’s $15 to experience one of the most thrilling atmospheres in all college football at the home of one of its most-storied and exciting teams. If that $105 doesn’t look like a good deal yet, keep in mind how much anyone else attending the games has to pay to make it 
past the gates. We’re talking $50 a head, and season tickets 
come with even more financial obligation in the form of donations to the program.
We’re not saying that $105 isn’t a good chunk of change, 
but in return you receive a level of excitement and wonder unrivaled in Gainesville.
Also, we have a sneaking suspicion that many of the 
complaining students are entering the lottery in the hopes of scoring tickets to re-sell. If you’re whining because the 
increase is cutting into your profit margins, go hang your 
head in shame. We’ll wait. We understand the problems posed by having to leave town for a game weekend, but we endorse the basketball ticket system for that reason. 
If you’re still not convinced that the money isn’t worth 
it, just don’t enter the lottery. With half of our student population crossing their fingers waiting for lottery re-sults over the summer, removing your name from the con-test will open a space for someone else. No matter what, 
the Swamp’s going to be at capacity come fall.
Baseball waning as national pastime
Many beautiful things accompany the emergence 
of spring. Flowers explode, birds rejoice and a long-awaited end of the school year looms closer. 
But for any red-blooded American, these trivialities are just minor blips on the radar as the arrival of spring means 
only one thing: baseball. 
More than just sunflower seeds and Cracker Jack, 
America’s favorite pastime brings us camaraderie, a 
hometown team to cheer and channels upon channels of games to choose from almost every night. No doubt the experience of a baseball game is wholesome and enjoyable — “fun for the whole family” if you will. However, in re-cent years, a new player (excuse the pun) has emerged to challenge baseball as America’s favorite pastime. Unless 
you’ve been under a rock the past few years, you know 
what I’m talking about: football. 
Beer-drinking fanatics operate on an entirely different 
level in the arena of football as program ratings have cer -
tainly shown. While this year’s Super Bowl was the most-watched ever with 111 million viewers, the last World Se-ries only reined in an average 14.3 million viewers. This statistic alone is a huge check in football’s box, and it is hard to disregard as trivial when comparing the two sports. 
So why is it that football is threatening to take the title of 
favorite pastime? Perhaps it has to do with season length. The National Football League’s regular season has only 16 games while Major League Baseball’s extends to 162. As the saying goes, perhaps quality — not quantity — has be-gun to prevail and spectators enjoy the week-long buildup of smack talk and tailgate-planning for a glutinous Sun-day of football over the scattering of baseball games avail-able every night. Baseball is played for more than a third 
of the year, and perhaps for some viewers it has lost the 
excitement football retains in its short, intensive season. A silly comparison would be Girl Scout cookies, which wouldn’t be nearly as popular if available year-round. Baseball is less anticipated due to the lengthy season and therefore less exciting. Or perhaps it’s the rising ticket prices due to rising player salaries. Everyone expects to pay an arm and leg to attend a football game, but base-
ball is supposed to be fairly cheap. 
As I can say from my experiences at Turner Field, $8.50 each for a hot dog and pretzel isn’t cheap — it’s outrageous. And if you want 
a cold beer, you’d better hope you picked your money tree this morning as it’ll easily run you $10. These novel-ties on top of the actual ticket price crush the picturesque afternoon-at-the-ballpark nostalgia. And then there’s the 
kicker (pun again intended). The real reason football has 
pulled so far ahead comes in such forms as the Big Ten, Pac 10 and, of course, the SEC. That’s right — college foot-ball. The atmosphere surrounding college football is in-toxicating, and people are thrilled with supporting a team they can associate with. Sure, you may wear a Browns hat on Sunday because you’re from Cleveland, but when your alma mater THE Ohio State University plays, you’ve got your face painted and banner flying in the front yard. You 
fondly remember your school days, or perhaps you’re still 
a student. Either way, it’s with a fiery passion that you cheer your boys. 
So, is baseball still America’s favorite pastime? Techni-
cally yes, but its grip is slowly slipping. Not many fans are still interested in the season after their team has clinched the division with 20 games left, so excitement wanes and soon “Have the playoffs started yet?” fills the air. Once the center of American culture, baseball has taken a step back 
as football moves in and captures minds and hearts. Don’t 
fret, baseball, you had a good run, but you may have fi-nally fouled out.

letters@alligator.orgEqualizing via E-books
Two bills working their 
way through our state legislature are aimed 
at bringing public schools into the digital age. They would either require 50 percent of materials spend-
ing to go toward digital 
books and e-readers, as in the Florida House’s version of the bill, or test the waters with certain schools invest-
ing in said technology.
We’re having trouble 
seeing a downside to giving 
students — especially high-
school-age kids who would 
be less likely to break a digi-tal device — a way to easily carry all of their books and download more along the 
way. The end result would 
be cheaper in the long run, and including Internet ac-cess would level the play-ing field for students lack-ing home computers or connections. 
Other than losing the 
tangible elements that stu-dents have associated with studying for generations — highlighting, dog-earing 
and bookmarking — the 
plan doesn’t seem to take anything away from pu-pils. Instead, it would add 
a much-needed familiarity 
with electronic devices and cut costs.
This change isn’t a result 
of a fad, but a natural evo-
lution of our current edu-
cational system into some-thing more inclusive and more portable. It’s using 
the Internet and technology 
to the best end.TUESDAY, APRIL 5, 2011 n  ALLIGATOR, 7
Merit-pay plan rewards growth
I would like to respond to a por -
tion of Chad Mohammed’s Thurs-
day column in which he said, “The merit-pay plan is flawed and sim-
ply will reward teachers for teach-
ing in areas with students of higher 
socioeconomic status and punish 
those who teach students of lower socioeconomic standings.” 
Senate Bill 736 is not a perfect 
bill, but this claim is demonstrably 
false. 
The language in the bill re-
peatedly and explicitly states that 
teachers will be judged based on 
“student learning growth.” As-
suming that the state and school 
districts ultimately employ a system similar to that in Tennes-
see, teachers will be evaluated on 
whether their students matched, 
exceeded or did not match the 
growth that would be expected of those students based on their cur -
rent level of achievement — based on three or more years of data — 
prior to entering the class. 
It is disconcerting to hear these 
false claims repeated ad nauseam 
when there are far more important 
and pressing debates to be had — 
like how to pay for it. The fact of 
the matter is that all students can learn regardless of their socioeco-
nomic background. They just need 
good teachers. 
There are plenty of issues with 
SB 736, but let’s focus on the ac-tual issues and not on the falsities 
propagated by certain entrenched 
interests. 
Danny Beaulieu
UF alumnus and Teach for America 
Corps MemberLetter to the Editor
Have your parents ever nagged you 
about being a social media addict 
who wastes hours of time on web-
sites like Facebook and Twitter? I hear it 
all the time: They say that maintaining on-line social “friendships” is superficial and 
pointless. Now, even experts argue that 
social media sites contribute to our narcis-
sism.
Social psychologists and journalists like 
The New York Times columnist David 
Brooks argue that the way our generation 
uses social media sites reveals a level of 
self-promotion not found among previous generations. They say Generation Y has turned into Generation Me. Apparently our 
egoism is just a click away.
One argument is that Facebook can serve 
as an easy outlet for the self-loving among 
us to flaunt our personal lives to the public. It’s true that Facebook is always looking for 
innovative ways to cater to the individual-
ity of its users. The new page layout, for 
example, lets you show off your languages, brag about where you’ve worked and list profound quotes that just scream “me.”
Perhaps you obsessively check Facebook 
throughout the day.
You probably jump on your phone every 
time you receive a text message, hoping it’s a Facebook notification. Your fingers quiver 
with excitement as the suspense mounts. 
You wonder who of your 500 “friends” 
could be responsible for that bright red box on the top left corner of the screen. You click it.
Yes! Your friendship request was accept-
ed, making your total number of friends 501 — many more than the number of Fa-cebook friends most of your peers have.
Another telltale sign of online narcissism 
is when you pull your phone out of your bag during class Monday morning, squirming to post an update about how amazing your weekend was. You planned that status the night before, spending hours agonizing over the exact phrasing before finally impress-ing your online groupies with your witty words.
Success! 
You re-ceived five 
“likes” in five minutes, moving your status from the bottom of the “Top News” feed to 
somewhere in the middle. Just provoke a 
few more “likes” and next time you really 
will be top news.
Does this sound like you? It might be 
an exaggeration, but you can’t say you’ve 
never been guilty of using Facebook for an 
ego boost. Whether it’s checking your page 
multiple times, posting mundane statuses about insignificant daily developments or comparing your profile to other friends’ 
pages, using Facebook is one of the quick-
est ways to inflate your head. After all, 
we’re social animals, and we do crave some attention — that’s human nature.
It’s why Facebook has been successful. 
The site feeds into our guilty pleasures and 
provides an outlet for our naturally egotis-
tical, adrenaline-rush-loving selves. Social media makes us feel like celebrities.
But is this narcissism? It depends on how 
you use it. Obviously there is an element 
of self-centrism on Facebook and Twitter. 
We want to know what our friends are up to, and we want others to know about us. That’s the point.
The trick with social media sites is to 
know how to use them wisely and when to stop sharing information before you be-come too self-involved. Take yours truly for example: I inhabit the social media scene 
with my Facebook page, a Twitter account 
and two blogs. But I use these sites primar -
ily to communicate with my friends.
On Twitter I follow several news sources 
and bloggers to keep up-to-date on all the 
news, which I wouldn’t be able to do as ef-ficiently otherwise.
There are also the professional net-
working opportunities. A few journalism professors have suggested their students use social media to get connected and pro-mote their work online. A professor recom -mended I use LinkedIn to post my resume 
and connect with employers. These days, 
it seems like every reporter has Twitter, 
LinkedIn and Facebook accounts to shame-lessly self-promote their work. The ques-tion for me is: When does networking and 
branding become plain showing off?
According to new studies, social media 
users can exploit networking tools to pro-
mote themselves in a productive way — sometimes.
According to a recent national San Di-
ego State University study, out of more than 1,000 college students, 92 percent of respondents said they use MySpace or Fa-cebook regularly, and 84 percent go online 
several times per day. A whopping two-
thirds agreed their generation is more self-
promoting, narcissistic and attention-seek-ing than previous generations. Fifty-seven percent said they attribute this narcissism 
to the use of social networking sites.
According to SDSU’s website, a profes-
sor who collaborated on the study had this 
to say about the findings:
“Students are right about the influence 
of social networking sites — research has 
shown that narcissistic people thrive on 
sites like Facebook, where self-centered people have more friends and post more at-tractive pictures of themselves.”
And here’s the kicker: Almost 40 percent 
of those polled think being narcissistic on-line is “helpful for succeeding in a competi-tive world.”
Perhaps Generation Y is more confi-
dent, and we’re definitely more connected 
to technology than previous generations. 
Certainly, social media sites can serve as a self-promoting outlet for the attention seek-ers among us.
But overall, we do a good job of keeping 
our online egos in check. The key is to net-work and socialize online with moderation, without forgetting to take advantage of the vast networking opportunities.

 UF WILL HOST UCF TONIGHT AT 7.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
Florida’s big bats are starting to get into the swing of 
things.
Preston Tucker, Austin Maddox and Brian Johnson — 
the Gators’ normal Nos. 3 through 5 hitters — have strug-gled recently at the plate. But that changed against Tennes-
see over the weekend, when the trio combined to go 12 for 
27 with five RBIs, two doubles and a home run, including a 
7-for-10 effort in Sunday’s 9-1 win.
“That’s the most positive thing we can move on from … 
is those three big donkeys in the middle had good days,” 
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
Tucker, Maddox and Johnson were amid a 3-for-32 
slump with five strikeouts and no RBIs. The stretch started 
when Florida hosted South Carolina on March 25-27 and lasted through the team’s loss to rival Florida State in Jack-sonville.
While those three were slumping, the Gators’ offense 
suffered. UF twice mustered a season-low three hits dur -
ing that span and dropped three of four games, losing the No. 1 ranking they had held since the preseason.
The struggles were especially disconcerting for Maddox 
and Johnson, a pair of sophomores who enjoyed successful freshman campaigns.
Maddox entered the weekend against Tennessee batting 
.260 with a .310 slugging percentage, both the lowest of any of the team’s everyday starters. Those numbers were down considerably from his freshman year, when he hit .333 and 
.587, respectively.
Maddox also went into the Tennessee series with just 
one home run and 10 RBIs after leading the Gators in both 
categories, with 17 homers and 72 RBIs last year.
Only a year removed from batting .405, Johnson was hit-
ting .289 before the weekend series.
The trio’s inconsistencies at the plate caused O’Sullivan 
to shuffle the lineup following the South Carolina series, ultimately moving each down two spots in the order. Cen-
ter fielder Kamm Washington moved to the three-hole, 
while hot-hitting catcher Mike Zunino batted cleanup.
Although the move didn’t do much for UF against FSU, 
it paid dividends last weekend. Florida rebounded with a sweep of Tennessee, and all three recorded multi-hit games 
Sunday for the first time since Feb. 22 against FAU.
Maddox went 5 for 10 with four RBIs against Tennessee, 
including a towering home run over the left-field stands 
Friday night. Tucker also pitched in with a 4-for-11 week-
end and an RBI double Sunday.
“Everybody in this lineup, they got a job to do,” Mad-
dox said. “Me and Tucker, we’ve been struggling a bit, but I feel like we’re starting to come around and do our job.”
When No. 4 Florida (24-5, 7-2 Southeastern Confer -
ence) hosts UCF (19-9, 2-4 Conference USA) tonight at 7, 
O’Sullivan suggested he would tinker with the Gators’ lineup again and return Tucker, Maddox and Johnson to their original spots in the heart of the order.
“It’s good to know that we got a couple power guys in

n THE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN WILL 
ANCHOR UF’S NEW-LOOK UNIT.

If Ronald Powell is as comfortable 
on the field as he was in front of report-
ers Monday afternoon, the Gators’ de-
fense should be in good shape.
Alongside fellow sophomores Do-
minique Easley and Sharrif Floyd, the 
6-foot-4, 250-pound “Buck” linebacker 
is also expected to become more of a 
vocal presence while anchoring Flori-da’s new-look defense in 2011.
With spring practices closed, UF 
fans will have to wait until Saturday’s 
Orange and Blue Debut to see if Powell 
assumes that role. But amid the usual, quiet question-and-answer sessions Monday afternoon, Powell never hesi-
tated to speak up.
Encircled by cameras and recorders, 
Powell cracked jokes, poked fun at a 
reporter’s wardrobe and asked another — mid-question — if he was nervous. 
When one reporter made reference to 
former-center Mike Pouncey “riding his butt” in practice last season, Powell let out a long, “Whoa,” and followed it 
up with, simply, “Next question.”
But on the practice field, only a few 
hundred yards away yet far removed 
from the watchful eyes of the media, the Gators have seen the steady emer -
gence of Powell, Easley and Floyd.
“A lot of guys are realizing that they 
have to step up, and they have to play a major role this year,” sophomore line-
backer Jelani Jenkins said. “You got a 
lot of guys that are just realizing that it’s their time to shine.”
Florida’s heralded recruiting class of 
2010 may have brought with them an undeserved sense of entitlement — to the point where Pouncey said last year 
the freshman just needed to “shut up” 
and play. But even then, linebacker Jon Bostic saw the potential of the team’s young defensive linemen. 
“When they came in, a lot of people

Despite seeing action in only six games 
and recording just four tackles, Dominique 
Easley was met with a lot of attention dur -
ing his freshman campaign.
Not for success on the field, but for off-
the-field issues.
Throughout the 2010 season, the New 
York native was surrounded by rumors he was thinking about transferring from Flori-da. Easley denied those reports Monday.
“I never thought I was 
going anywhere else,” he said.
Easley repeatedly denied 
the idea he thought about leaving UF as a reporter pushed him more about the 
situation,  even mentioning a previous sto-ry in which Easley was quoted as consider -
ing other options.
The defensive tackle only grew more 
defiant, saying, “Dominique didn’t.”
But Easley can’t argue there wasn’t 
some friction between him and the coaches last season. When UF played Vanderbilt last year, he was not on the team’s travel roster for “a lot of reasons,” according to Urban Meyer.
But the coaching change has left Easley 
with a different mindset and intensity that is drawing praise from some of his team-mates.
“That’s probably the fastest I’ve ever 
seen somebody get off the ball,” lineback-Easley nixes

In pro wrestling, real danger not as fake as scripted matches
How do you know when a fake wrestler is hurt for 
real?
The question went through my mind after sac-
rificing $65 to watch huge men pretend to hate each other 
on TV. For about 3 hours and 55 minutes, Wrestlemania 
XXVII made for good, drunken fun Sunday night. For a few fleeting moments, though, I thought someone was out — for real.
The Undertaker (real name: Mark Calaway) buckled 
while leaving the ring following a 20-minute match. He had been thrown through a collapsible table. He had fall-en on his neck after botching a 10-foot leap from the ropes. He had been slammed face-first into the mat three consecutive times.
Any educated person older than 8 
knew Calaway was going to be fine, just like he had been after countless other matches in the last 20 years. But what if he wasn’t? What if this 
was Stone Cold Steve Austin break-
ing his neck again?
Pro wrestling is cartoonish. It’s 
good guy vs. bad guy. Calaway him-
self pretends to be a dead man with supernatural powers whose brother is infatuated with fire — and also happens to be a wrestler.
Despite 95 percent of what happens in and around the 
ring, wrestling should not be taken lightly. The WWE grossed $203 million last year. On Sunday night alone, the company drew 71,617 fans to the Georgia Dome and made $6.6 million.
Regardless, the WWE does not provide health insur -
ance for Calaway, or any other wrestler. If his ACL tears on the job, he’s paying for it. 
Wrestlers are independent contractors. Technically,

Floyd working at DT, DE in multi-scheme defense
saw a lot of different things,” Bostic 
said. “But you saw a lot of that fresh-man class, the little flashes they had.”
Each of the three has earned sub-
stantial praise from their teammates and coach Will Muschamp through three weeks of spring practice, and 
they figure to be a critical part of the 
Gators’ revamped defense in 2011.
Florida’s defensive versatility 
hinges on Powell’s ability to play line-backer or put his hand down in his 
new “Buck” position — a similar role 
to what Jason Taylor and Sergio Kin-dle did under Muschamp. Powell will often line up beside Ea-
sley, who only played in six games last season amid a lot of off-the-field con-troversy, and he praised the 6-foot-2, 
278-pound Easley’s quick first step.
“Easley is so explo-
sive off the ball. His 
get-off is just ridicu-
lous,” Powell said. “It 
makes it hard for guys to block him.
“Because by the time 
they snap the ball and get ready for 
the block, he’s already past them.”
Floyd will line up inside with Ea-
sley when Florida plays four down 
linemen, and the 6-foot-3, 303-pound-er said he has also been working more at defensive end in the 3-4.
“He’s got the get off the ball, the 
penetration, and I’ve got the power,” 
Floyd said. “Great combination, and 
we cause a lot of havoc.”
While Powell’s coming-out party 
before the local media Monday was 
somewhat unexpected, he said the 
emergence of the sophomore defen-sive line trio should be viewed as any-thing but surprising.
“I knew a lot of these guys had it 
in them,” Powell said. “It was just a matter of when we were going to start showing our talent, so it’s not really surprising.”FOOTBALL , from page 15
er Jon Bostic said of Easley’s spring showing. 
“Sometimes when you pause the film and just look, every other defensive lineman has taken half a step or one step, and he has already taken two or three.”
QUINN INSTALLING VERSATILE DEFENSE: There 
have been a lot of questions about Florida’s 
new-look offense, but by comparison, the changes on the defensive side of the ball have been overlooked.
The unit is not only learning a new system 
in the spring, but it’s also trying to replace its leader in safety Ahmad Black, who led the team 
with 108 tackles last season.
Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn has in-
stalled a defense that will switch between 3-4 
and 4-3 schemes throughout the game to keep offenses guessing. Linebacker Jelani Jenkins said they have not practiced one package more than the other in the spring. 
“[Quinn] has thrown a lot of different de-
fenses at us,” Bostic said. “For a lot of the young 
guys, it’s kind of overwhelming. But for some 
of the guys that were here last year, it’s a lot of carryover.”
INJURY UPDATE: Offensive tackle Xavier Nix-
on and wide receiver Andre Debose did not 
practice Saturday. 
Both have been sidelined by sprained an-
kles, and coach Will Muschamp said Thursday 
that he hoped both would be back at the end 
of last week or the beginning of this week.

they can work for three or four different companies at 
the same time. But the WWE operates all year, with two events on cable each week, a pay-per-view once a month 
and countless non-televised promotional events.
Calaway is not really an independent contractor, but 
Vince McMahon and the rest of the WWE executives want their employees signed to that type of deal to keep the company off the hook. Any medical problems? They aren’t 
paying. A wrestler tests positive for steroids? He isn’t re-ally their wrestler.
The answer, of course, is for Calaway and the rest of 
the wrestlers to unionize. Good luck. Jesse Ventura tried to 
do that in the ’80s, but he says McMahon fired him upon 
finding out.
McMahon probably would not do that to someone as 
popular as Calaway, but in a business predicated on fake 
storylines, McMahon could always cut his pay and put the 
Undertaker in unimportant matches.
McMahon said in the past that if he paid for health in-
surance, he would have to take money away from wres-
tlers’ contracts. And some are making good money. A WWE spokesman said last year the average salary was $550,000. 
But, like in the NFL, the shelf life for most wrestlers 
is not long. And their injuries don’t subside just because their careers end. 
Granted, this is all scripted. Calaway knew he would 
win months ago. But there is a difference between scripted and fake. 
Those punches? The ones Calaway landed while yelling 
“Boom!” as the camera switched angles to confuse view-ers? Those are fake. But you don’t fake jumping off a 20-foot ladder. That’s scripted.
To make matters more confusing Sunday night, Cala-
way’s opponent, Triple H (real name: Paul Levesque), 
stood next to him while waiting for the emergency team to 
arrive. What if this was Levesque having his quad tear off the bone again?
What if this was Mick Foley suffering kidney damage 
after falling off a cage again?  What if this was Owen Hart falling from the rafter’s again? Eddie Guerrero dying of heart failure? 
What if this was the one time we finally all paid atten-
tion?TYLER , from page 15Football
