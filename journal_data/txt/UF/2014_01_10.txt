Erica Brown’s 6-year-old son doesn’t understand why his 
family can’t go home.
Brown and her three young children have been living in a 
hotel since Monday because of a serious mold problem in her 
Horizon House apartment.
“It’s not even safe to go into the apartment, the smell is so hor-
rid,” the 26-year-old single mother said. “I want a place where I can not be worried about things getting into the walls and into our lungs.”
She first noticed the problem last year, only a few months af-
ter moving into the complex located at 1515 NW 10th St.
Both she and her two daughters suffer from asthma, so after 
spotting mold on the ceiling of her bathroom, Brown immedi-ately called maintenance. She was ignored for months. Finally, 
maintenance came by and discovered the toilet in the apartment 
upstairs was leaking. The worker sprayed the room with bleach and painted over the area.
Last week, Brown discovered black mold in the closet of the 
room her 4-year-old and 19-month-old daughters share.
Despite pleas to the landlord and maintenance staff, nothing 
was done. The complex offered to move her to another apart-ment, but after talking to neighbors, Brown realized it wouldn’t 
make a difference.
Resident Walette Mulberry, 38, has been battling mold since 
she moved into her apartment five years ago. Lately, it’s been 
getting worse. 
Now, she and her two kids — ages 8 and 11 — sleep in the 
living room. One of the three bedrooms serves as their closet Families battling apartment mold

With flu season in progress, the UF Student 
Health Care Center is urging students to take pre-
cautions.
The center sent an email Thursday encouraging 
students to take action against the flu, including 
getting vaccinated and taking daily preventative 
measures such as using hand sanitizer.
Alachua County health department adminis-
trator Paul Myers said the end of January is peak flu season for Alachua County. UF Health Shands Hospital has seen more than 150 flu-related admis-sions and a dozen connected deaths since late Oc-tober, according to a news release.
“We are seeing an increase in severity of flu this 
year, as reported by Shands,” Myers said. “We’re seeing vast majorities succumb to the disease that were not vaccinated.”
The Student Health Care Center has run out of 
vaccines for the season, according to the email.
Myers suggests students get vaccinated at a lo-
cal pharmacy or the county health department.
“We really encourage individuals to get vacci-
nated so they can be protected for the rest of the year,” he said.
However, some students such as Matt Burke, a 
20-year-old UF environmental engineering sopho-more, said they were not planning on getting vac-
cinated. 
“I figured I’ll take my chances,” he said. “I’m 
not against vaccines. I just don’t think it’s neces-
sary for me.”UF health

� CHICKEN DISHES DOMINATE THE MENU.

Kay Bros. BBQ may have closed at the beginning of De-
cember, but starting Saturday, Gainesville residents can visit 
a new restaurant in the same location.
The Coop is opening under the same ownership as Kay 
Bros. but with a different menu, featuring chicken tenders and wings, as well as shakes and homemade sauces.
The Coop, located next to the Florida Bookstore, will be 
more affordable than the old restaurant, said co-owner Dar-ren Kay. 
“The biggest thing for us is to offer college students a price 
they are willing to pay more frequently,” Darren Kay said.  
The restaurant will also offer ice cream milkshakes and de-
livery with Gainesville2Go to “extend beyond the roots,” said Steven Kay, Darren Kay’s brother and co-owner.  
The Coop will be incorporating the same mac ‘n cheese 
from Kay Bros. into its menu, as well as its original ingredi-ents for sauces. 
“It’s a different menu but the same quality food,” Steven 
Kay said. 
Everything made at The Coop is fresh, he said. Guests 
can also see the cooks making their meals through the open kitchen window.
Along with the renovation, the brothers used recycled 
wood pallets and license plates to decorate the restaurant. 
“Our goal is to serve the students and staff at UF and the The Coop to open Saturday in former Kay Bros. locationSee MOLd, PA ge 5

When it comes to the treat-
ment of UF laboratory animals, 
a local organization isn’t mon-keying around.
Karen Kline, senior labora-
tory investigator for animal-rights group Eleventh Hour for Animals, ﬁ  led a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agri-culture last month, detailing a “culture of negligence” toward animals used in UF research.
The complaint claims that 
the treatment of Louis, a ma-
caque monkey euthanized in 
2010, violated the Animal Wel-fare Act. The action follows the group’s three-year-long battle with the university to gain access to public veterinary records, which were ﬁ  nally re-ceived in April.
Kline said the records re-
vealed that researchers failed to treat Louis’ damaged hip, treat-ing him for parasites for a year until he was euthanized.
“He had a broken hip, and 
he wasn’t treated for it. That’s animal abuse right there,” she said. “They are supposed to be scientists, but if they can’t ﬁ  x a broken hip, what are they do-ing?”
UF spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes said the university is aware of the complaint and will comply with any requests made by the USDA. 
“The University of Florida 
is subject to very stringent state and federal laws regarding the care of laboratory animals,” she said. “We take care to make 
sure our animals are kept in a healthy environment.”
On top of the complaint, 
Kline also ﬁ  led a lawsuit against 
UF for refusing to comply with an October request for public records about the treatment of 25 research primates.
Marcy LaHart, Kline’s law-
yer, said the university’s at-torney contacted her after the ﬁ  ling and said the lack of re-
sponse was due to a communi-
cation error.
Jayda Fleishman, a 20-year-
old UF zoology junior, said she would not be surprised if research animals were being mistreated.
“Abuse is totally possible,” 
she said. “They can’t watch ev-
erything that happens.”
But Julie Coutu, a 19-year-
old UF women’s studies sopho-
more, said animal research is sometimes a necessary evil.
“If humans will die other-
wise, I think it’s necessary,” she said.
However, there’s still hope 
for the animals’ future, said Kari Bagnall, executive director of Gainesville’s Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary. Thirty per-cent of the primates they house at their facility are former re-search subjects, and the num-ber is only growing.
“We’re hoping that the 
trend continues,” Bagnall said. “There is deﬁ  nitely life after re-search.”
Still, Kline said her organiza-
tion is committed to informing the public about UF’s research practices.
“I need the taxpayers to 
see this and understand what 
is happening as far as the cor-
ruption in the University of Florida,” she said. “The ani-mals need somebody to speak for them.”Activists fight for

STATE
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ST. PETERSBURG — The attor-
ney for a woman who accused star 
Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston of sexual assault said Thursday that she intends to sue the 
school, the Tallahassee Police De-
partment and the player himself.
Patricia Carroll said she plans to 
ﬁ  le a notice to sue the police depart-ment early next week. Under Florida law, anyone ﬁ  ling a lawsuit against a government agency must ﬁ  le court paperwork six months prior to the suit itself.
The sexual encounter between 
Winston and Carroll’s client hap-pened on Dec. 7, 2012. Winston’s at-torney said the sex was consensual and no charges were ﬁ  led against Winston after Leon County prosecu-tors investigated whether an assault took place.
But Carroll said her client was 
sexually assaulted. The woman was 
19 at the time and reported what 
happened to Tallahassee Police.
At a mid-December news confer-
ence, Carroll criticized the way the police investigation was handled, saying that detectives failed to in-terview key witnesses, used unreli-able and incomplete forensic tests and never tested the alleged victim’s 
blood for the presence of date-rape 
drugs. Carroll said that her client was “treated like a suspect.”
Tallahassee police have defended 
their handling of the case, and Car-roll said she received a letter from the department that said an internal investigation found the case was handled with proper procedures.Carroll has also criticized police 
for not submitting her client’s sexual assault kit to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement lab until Jan. 17, 
2013 — 39 days after it was taken. 
The attorney questioned whether evidence was properly preserved during those 39 days.
Carroll says she asked Florida’s 
attorney general, the state depart-ment of law enforcement and Gov. Rick Scott for an examination into the rape investigation, claiming it 
was riddled with problems.
Scott “didn’t even give us the 
courtesy of a response,” Carroll said, 
adding that in her letters to ofﬁ  cials, she mentioned the unrelated cases of two other FSU students who said they were raped but were “discour-aged” from going through with a prosecution.

Julia Rae Varnes wasn’t surprised when 
she saw a recent study about adults and their 
drinking habits.                                   
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention reported that 38 million adults in the 
United States drink too much, and only one 
out of six patients talks honestly to his or her doctor about how much alcohol he or she drinks.   
Varnes, a specialist at GatorWell Health 
Promotion Services, said doctors run into that roadblock frequently.        
She said many students have already had 
someone confront them about their drinking 
habits and don’t feel like getting another lec-
ture from their doctor. And busy physicians rarely feel they have the time to cajole truthful answers from patients.               
This combination can be dangerous.“If a doctor wants to prescribe you a medi-
cation, they need to know what kinds of things you are consuming,” she said. “If you’re using anything that might affect how a medication is 
going to work for you, a doctor may decide to 
give you something else.”
Oliver Tranter, a UF building construction 
freshman, said he wasn’t shocked by the study either, and he agreed that doctors can seem disapproving.
“It’s kind of frowned upon by them to 
drink a lot,” he said.
But Varnes said a serious issue underlies 
the awkward situation of discussing alcohol consumption with a doctor.                    
She said alcohol can impact the immune 
system and make it more susceptible to dis-eases. It can also affect students’ academics.        
“I would advise students to be honest with 
their doctors,” Varnes said. “They might ask if they’ve considered decreasing the amount they drink, but they’re not going to sit there 
and give them a 15-minute lecture. They don’t 
have time for that either.”Varnes said doctors will not say a lot to 
sway students’ minds about alcohol. Studies have shown that short pep talks are most ef-fective because the student is the one who de-cides to make the change. 
“When you talk about your drinking, the 
doctor won’t say, ‘Oh, you can’t be my patient anymore,’” Varnes said.                                                                                                  She said overall her biggest concern is the 
health and safety of the students.  
“It’s heartbreaking to hear about a student 
death related to alcohol,” she said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study saying Americans may be drinking too much alcohol and 
then lying to their doctors about how much they drink. A UF expert said this can be dangerous.
Patients drinking, then lying to doctors about how muchand changing areas. The other rooms 
are covered with mold.
Another resident, Onteria Lawrence, 
had to throw away boxes of clothing, a pile of DVDs and assorted dining room 
furniture because of mildew.
Her 4-year-old son, Timarkis Archie, 
played outside as Lawrence, 25, pushed 
a bureau down the stairway leading up to the second-story apartment she shares with her four children. 
“I can’t afford to throw this away, 
but I got to,” Lawrence said. “Even my Bible, the Holy Bible, I have to throw 
away.”
With no response from the complex, 
Brown decided to look for help else-
where.  She called the health department and the Gainesville Code Enforcement ofﬁ  ce but was told no one could help.
Brown found her son’s room overrun 
with green and black mold, surround-ing the window frame and windowsill, 
creeping down to the baseboard.
Her son’s grandmother went to the 
ofﬁ  ce to confront the landlord and get a 
promise that Horizon House would pro-vide a hotel room for Brown’s family.
But the complex didn’t come through. 
Brown’s been paying out of pocket.
That’s when Commissioner Yvonne Hinson-Rawls stepped in. A staff mem-ber at Brown’s older daughter’s school, Metcalfe Elementary, reached out to the commissioner.
“Mold can make people sick, you 
know,” Hinson-Rawls said. “When 
you’re living in an environment with 
mold, and you’re trying to raise a child, it has an effect on a child’s education, and I’m an educator at heart.”
A Code Enforcement ofﬁ  cer came by 
to inspect Brown’s apartment Wednes-day afternoon. 
The ofﬁ  cer found mold in her apart-
ment, likely caused by humid condi-
tions, according to an email from Code 
Enforcement division manager Chris-topher Cooper sent over the City of Gainesville Listserv. Apartment staff said they are aware of similar issues in three other apartments and offered to place all four families in a hotel while they conducted further tests, according to the email.
Horizon House Apartments declined 
to comment on the issue.
On Thursday afternoon, Lawrence 
cleaned, still waiting for someone to tell her where the family could stay while a mold remediation contractor looked at their apartment. 
“Even a dog doesn’t deserve to live 
like this, and we’re human beings,” she 
said.FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A new restaurant will replace Kay Bros. BBQ at 1620 W. University Ave. The Coop is set 
to open on Saturday and will feature a Southern-inspired menu.
It hopes to be more affordable

After the initial opening Saturday, The 
Coop will host an opening celebration Tues-day, in which they will give away rafﬂ  e prizes 
and free chicken tenders from 4 to 7 p.m.
Sara Schuster, a 20-year-old UF math and

Coop will attract more students because of the lower prices.“I had heard that Kay Bros. was good but 
too expensive,” Schuster said.  
Kevin Doan, a UF business administration 
freshman and self-proclaimed “sauce guy,” said he likes the fact that the restaurant con-cocts unique sauce recipes.
Doan, 18, said he plans to attend the event

Students looking to drop pounds can at-
tend Weight Watchers meetings at UF for the 
ﬁ  rst time.
UF “Living Well” meetings will be held at 
12:30 p.m Thursdays in the Florida Gymnasi-
um, Room 215, and will last about 30 minutes.
Rachel Cooksey, who will lead the meet-
ings, wrote in an email that UF students and 
staff are given a discounted rate of about $40 for the monthly membership. 
“I believe students and staff are unaware 
there is a place for them to learn healthy habits and gain accountability in a friendly group set-ting,” she said. Cooksey said she considers Weight Watch-
ers an ideal starting point for anyone looking to lose weight or live a healthier lifestyle. 
But Roberta Seldman, an eating disorder 
and body dissatisfaction specialist at the UF Counseling & Wellness Center, cautioned that she has seen beneﬁ  ts from weight loss pro-grams but also negative side effects.
“I have had many students whose well-in-
tended parents sent them to Weight Watchers as young teens,” she wrote in an email. “The results (were) not great because the message ‘you are fat’ was so shaming that they became sneak-eaters and bingers. This is not to say that some have (not) greatly beneﬁ  tted from these kinds of programs.”
Haley Edelson, a 21-year-old UF marketing 
senior, said she ﬁ  nds the concept of Weight Watchers attractive but is wary of the cost.
“From the perspective of a college student, 
referring to health and ﬁ  tness websites and blogs seem like a much better idea,” she said.Weight Watchers on campus

Gainesville Police arrested an Alachua 
man whom ofﬁ  cers said passed out be-
hind the wheel of a car after hufﬁ  ng cans of cleaning duster spray. 
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 40-year-old Rodney 
Wayne Plylar on charges of inhaling harmful chemicals, marijuana posses-sion, drug equipment possession and driving under the inﬂ  uence, according to an arrest report.
At about 8 p.m., an ofﬁ  cer responded 
to a car that had crashed into a ditch in the 6900 block of West University Av-enue and found Plylar passed out at the 
wheel with a can of cleaning duster spray 
in his hand.
The ofﬁ  cer noticed urine on Plylar’s 
pants and the smell of pee on the driv-er’s seat. Plylar, who was sitting on the ground while police 
spoke with him, said 
he spilled Coke on his pants, according to the report. 
Ofﬁ  cers discovered 
45 cans of cleaning 
duster, fewer than 20 grams of marijuana and a device for smoking marijuana in Plylar’s car, according to the report.
Plylar performed poorly on ﬁ  eld so-
briety tests. The results from his breath test showed that he had been hufﬁ  ng the 
duster spray.
During questioning, Plylar told of-
ﬁ  cers he was using the cleaning duster 
cans to clean cement, according to the report. Ofﬁ  cers booked him into Alachua County Jail with a $9,000 bond.Man arrested after hufﬁ  ng

Hairy situation: Don’t be bullied by trends
During my first semester of college, while killing 
time between classes, I found myself listening in 
on a classmate and his friends as they loudly en-
gaged in a “Would you rather?” about girls. 
My classmate posed a question along the lines of, 
“If you had to choose between a girl who doesn’t shave 
her armpits and a girl who doesn’t shave her legs, who would you pick?”
I don’t remember each individual response, but when 
the guys asked my classmate the same thing, he said, 
“Armpits. Because if she doesn’t shave her legs, she 
probably has a hairy vagina.” The group of boys — and boys they were, judging by their open disgust at some 
hair — nodded in agreement. “True, yeah man. Ew.”
Even though I was eavesdropping, I laughed out loud 
at his logic because, having been a girl for 22 years, I can’t even begin to explain what a misconception that assump-
tion was.
I mean, come on. Ladies, how many times have you 
had a groomed va-jay-jay and, for whatever reason, omit-ted leg shaving from your shower routine?
And because I’m all about being inclusive, manscap-
ing men, how often after a fresh manscape have your legs been full-on Chewbacca? For a ton of you, the answer is probably always. But I digress.
Although that particular moment of bro talk I over-
heard has had no significant impact on my day-to-day life, it was the first thing that popped in my head when I 
saw the words “Pubic hair is back” in a November head-
line in the Telegraph.
The article talks about, you guessed it, pubes being 
back on trend — for women, that is. The article cites a study by UKMedix that says 51 percent of about 2,000 women surveyed keep their lady bits au naturale. The 
main reasons listed were, women said, they could no lon-
ger be bothered to keep up the grooming — 45 percent — and women’s partners preferring the natural look — 62 
percent.
The survey results prompted the media to let women know that by societal standards, 
it was once again acceptable to 
let their downstairs do its own 
thing. And there was a large re-sponse. 
From “pubes are pretty” to “bald is beautiful,” it seems 
everyone who knows what a vagina is has had something to say about what the grooming standard should be. And 
everyone seems adamant that whatever he or she thinks 
is the only accurate viewpoint.
Well, ladies, I’m here to tell you that regardless of 
trends, it has always been OK to make your own deci-sions about your body.
Do you think men let the media dictate the state of 
their pubes? From a very unscientific stance, I can tell you that guys who manscape don’t do it because some 
survey said it’s the way their package should look.
Just ask the dudes in your life if they manscape and 
why. I’ll bet you’re not surprised by the responses.
Some manscape because they’ve been asked. Some 
don’t touch the hair because it freaks them out. Some will 
admit to being waxed because they lost a bet.
People will always have their reasons for doing things, 
just as people will have reasons for liking what they like — but you shouldn’t feel pressured to conform to hairi-
ness or hairlessness.
As someone who likes to try new things, I can attest 
to the pros and cons of a variety of grooming styles. And you know what? There are about as many pros as there 
are cons to all sides, depending on who you ask.
The best way to be comfortable with your body is to 
know what you like and why.
So, go out there and get that hair waxed into the star 
you are. Let that bush grow ‘til it sticks out of your bikini 
bottoms. Let your partner shave you bald.  
Know your body. Know your taste, and, as I would 
tell my BFF, just do you.

Yeah, I know, you’re sick of hearing about it, but this 
first DART goes to Chris Christie — or, more specifically, 
his aides who authorized a two-lane closure on a major 
New Jersey roadway, the George Washington Bridge, a few 
months ago. According to The New York Times, emails and texts from a few of his top-ranking aides revealed that the closure was authorized solely to punish Fort Lee’s mayor 
for choosing not to endorse the governor for re-election. 
That’s certainly one way to reinforce New Jersey’s Mafia 
stereotypes — causing gridlock on a high-traffic road is mob 
intimidation behavior if we’ve ever seen it. Christie denies knowledge of the closure, which resulted in school buses 
full of children being stuck for hours in traffic and delayed 
response times for emergency vehicles. Ugh. Those aides better watch out — now that their names were released, they may find themselves sleeping with the fishes soon. 
In more positive news, a LAUREL to teen heartthrob and 
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden for donating $50,000 to the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Philadelphia-based Women Against Abuse on Tuesday, a month after winning the money at Pennsylvania’s biggest 
annual political gathering, according to philly.com. 
No wonder Leslie Knope is so smitten. 
Until this week, Utah wasn’t known for anything except 
the 2002 Winter Olympics, creepy polygamy with Mormon 
child brides and a booming meth industry. Now, the state 
is in the public eye for putting a halt on gay marriage with-in the state, according to the Los Angeles Times, which is really just a gross thing to do. For heaven’s sake, people in love just want to get married. This legal limbo is unfair and 
cruel to gay couples. So to Utah, we give a DART.
Finally, a LAUREL to our cool — literally — readers for

Last fall I was in a local coffee shop 
with a young man from Saudi Ara-
bia. A lesbian friend of mine was at 
the table with us. The man asked her if she 
was married, and she said she would like to be but that she was attracted to women. 
With a stunned look on his face he told 
her that there are hospitals that can ﬁ  x that. 
I told him that having same-sex attrac-
tion was not a choice or a disease. He re-
plied that may be true in the United States, 
but in Saudi Arabia, people in that posi-tion are executed.
While the U.S. is making progress in 
allowing the basic civil right of same-sex marriage, Gulf Cooperation Countries continue to execute gay people. Now there is a new threat on the horizon for the LGBT world. Kuwait is now claiming they 
have discovered a “medical test” that can 
“detect” if someone is gay, said Yousuf Mindkar, director for Kuwait’s Ministry of Public Health.
Being gay is a natural hu-
man condition. The idea that Kuwait could actually medi-cally diagnose homosexuality is absurd. It seems they are devising a way 
to discriminate against those whom they 
suspect could be gay, making Kuwait the demagogue of the Gulf Cooperation Coun-tries.
The Gulf Cooperation Countries  is far 
too religiously extreme to consider same-sex marriage, which deﬁ  nes them in auto-cratic contrast to the growing equal rights agenda the U.S. should be proud of. How-
ever, to stop foreign entry into their coun-
tries, simply on the suspicion of someone being gay, to the degree of inventing a foolish medical test, should be met with international boycott in the strictest sense.
Out of more than 70 countries that still 
outlaw homosexuality, the Gulf Coop-eration Countries allege to be the most West-friendly, yet Saudi Ara-bia beheads LGBT people on 
a regular basis. It is a sad day 
when there is so much hate that a medical fallacy is put into op-
eration over a small group of people who 
are not a threat to anyone. Then again, we 
are talking about Gulf Cooperation Coun-tries where human abuse and perverse ac-tivities are the norm. But this goes beyond the scope of detestable.
It is heartbreaking to think about the 
suffering of LGBT citizens in the Gulf Co-operation Countries. These are countries where the family chooses marriage part-
ners for their sons, many times with girls 
as young as 10 years old. It is unimagina-ble to think about the life of both a child bride and the secretly gay husband she is forced to spend her life with, and they are 
trapped inside these countries by corpo-
rate wealth, with no voice or escape.
Other countries, such as Uganda, have been bribed by the American Christian right to execute gay people as well. And 
India just reinstated the heinous laws 
against homosexual activities. It is dis-gusting that such zealots aim to destroy innocent lives over religious bigotry. The 
Gulf Cooperation Countries’s desire for 
the world to view them as modern and progressive will surely be questioned now with the new medical gay detector.
As it stands, anyone under 21 in Ku-
wait caught participating in activities con-sidered “gay” will be jailed for 10 years. Those trying to enter the Gulf Cooperation Countries who are found to be gay will not 
be allowed entry, or deported if already 
inside the borders. Someone should tell the Gulf Cooperation Countries to wake up and join the diversity of the progres-sive 21st century.
Rose Jones is a writer for The Daily Utah 
Chronicle. A version of this column originally appeared on UWire.
‘Gaydar’ and other treatment are religious bigotry at new levelsUWireGather some Colt 
45s and maybe a few Zig-Zags: 
Afroman is coming to the High Dive on Wednes-day. Afroman, or Joseph Foreman, Grammy-nom-inated slacker rapper star behind the hits “Because I Got High” and dirty rap anthem “Crazy Rap” — known to many as “Colt 45 and Two Zig-Zags” — is leaving his beloved Palmdale to bring Gainesville the music that has enchanted generations since he rose to fame and fortune in the early 2000s. 
Foreman became Afroman in the 
eighth grade when a teacher got him expelled for sagging his pants. By the time he wrote, recorded and sold 400 copies of a song about said teacher, he realized music was his calling.    
Afroman’s big moment came in 
2000, when his album “Because I Got High” and the eponymous sin-gle from that album dropped. When the Internet got a hold of the song, which describes a man neglecting his responsibilities because he’s gotten high, with increasingly severe conse-quences, Afroman became an instant sensation.  
Along with a Grammy nomination 
and a music video where he smokes a joint the size of his forearm with Jay and Silent Bob, the stoner bal-lad ensured Afroman’s presence in the memories of fans and detractors alike, however hazy those memo-ries may be. With the release a year later of “Crazy Rap,”  a song that is remarkable in that no part of it can actually be described in publication, it seemed Afroman’s career was only headed toward greater fame.But that was not how 
things turned out for Afroman. His most sig-niﬁ  cant achievements since the early 2000s have been his slew of parody albums; one of country music — “Save a Cadil-lac, Ride a Homeboy” — and two holiday al-
bums, “Jobe Bells” and “A Colt 45 Christmas”, featuring between them jingles such as “O Chronic Tree,” “Nutscracker,” “The 12 Js of X-mas” and “Deck My Balls.” 
Perhaps the public grew tired of 
songs that, funny at ﬁ  rst, really are only about weed, cheap beer and sex.  
Although that may seem like an 
ignorant criticism of rap — it is — in Afroman’s case it’s just a description.  There is no glamour to his music — he sells it like it is, and I believe that makes it beautiful.  It would be 
easy to dismiss Afroman, to say he’s 
washed up and no longer relevant.  
My retort would be, A.) No one 
who was nominated for a 2002 Gram-my is still relevant. The artist he lost to was Missy Elliot, and his other main competitor was Nelly. This is a totally different world. B.) Afroman was never relevant in the ﬁ  rst place.
He was one of the ﬁ  rst viral phe-
nomena, just sitting on the corner selling rap CDs to whupping into the spotlight. Though he enjoyed fame and fortune, he had the courage to give that up and pursue his true dream instead — making music that brings people joy, lowriding and sa-voring life, with a blunt in one hand and a 40 in the other.

opinions@alligator.orgWhen I ﬁ  rst caught wind 
of Nelson Mandela’s passing last month, 
my mind started racing a mil-lion miles an hour. His politi-
cal views were to the left. Mine are to the 
right. But with Nelson Mandela, none of that matters.
Mandela’s death highlights the enor-
mous odds he overcame and shines a spot-light on South Africa as a leader of democ-racy in such a dark continent. My hope is that the spotlight shines bright enough for our government to realize what can be 
done in Africa.
Central Africa still suffers from a long, 
disturbing trend of ethnic violence. France 
and Great Britain provide military aid to Central African Republic to suppress ﬁ  ght-ing. Nigeria and the Western Sahara region is rampant with radical Islamic attacks on Christians. Sudan and South Sudan recent-ly split but are marred with racial tensions 
and tribal warfare. Now that Mandela’s 
gone, we can only hope South Africa will be able to control its rampant crime with-out developing a militaristic state or losing democracy.
The United States currently gives rough-
ly $8 billion per year in foreign aid to Afri-can countries. Although the cost is fair, the recipients are somewhat shady. In 2014, we 
are scheduled to give $210 million to Soma-
lia, a country with essentially no govern-ment and citizens plagued with piracy and radical Islam. Countries like Uganda and Zimbabwe may not have stable govern-ments, but it doesn’t seem to matter; we’re scheduled to give Zimbabwe $152 million next year. And Egypt, the country in tur-moil and a recent adopter of Sharia Law, is 
slated $1.7 billion in foreign aid next year.
Of the $8 billion being shipped to Africa 
next year, the real question is: Who will ac-
tually see it? 
How much will be gobbled up into the 
personal accounts of corrupt leaders while their citizens continue to starve and live in poverty? How much of the money will be funneled into the pockets of terrorists 
by governments fearing terrorism with no 
way to combat it but bribery?
Africa needs a remodel, and America 
needs to be the constructor. As a whole, Af-rica has more potential than most realize, but doors are closing fast.
Militarily, Africa contains a corridor to the Middle East and is crucial to the ﬁ  ght against terrorism. With proper military training for countries such as Egypt and Libya, we can gain crucial allies 
against terror. With the Arab Spring and new governments arising, there has never been a better time to build strong military ties between the United States, Egypt and Libya.
Politically, Africa provides both dangers 
and opportunities. Our promise and deter-mination to quell terrorism can’t be success-ful without an attempt to contain its spread 
to Africa. Although military measures are 
unnecessary and would be very unpopular, a strong diplomatic surge through Africa can be beneﬁ  cial. Due to the state of most African nations, it would be hard for any to turn down a stronger relationship with the United States. The more political allies we have in the ﬁ  ght against terror, the more successful we will be.
What we need to do is rethink and re-
vamp our strategy in Africa. Instead of con-tinuing our decades of neglect and minimal effort, we need to begin decades of building strong relationships with not only African governments, but with African people.
Instead of handing out aid to violent 
dictators and corrupt governments, let’s use some of that money to help the coun-
tries dedicated to improvement. Strip most 
of the aid going to countries like Zimba-bwe, Uganda and Somalia while allotting more to the likes of Ghana and Kenya.  In reality, the money going to corrupt govern-ments isn’t going to be seen by the people who need it anyway. We should allot some of the stripped money as grant money for non-governmental organizations. In most 
cases, the money going to these organiza-
tions goes straight to helping people in need. It’s a plan that doesn’t cost us any more money, but it rewards countries and governments that deserve more.
We need to support leaders in Africa 
who rally around the principles of Nelson Mandela, ones who will not forget ethnic tensions but will forgive for the sake of the 
future of their country. We can support 
Mandela’s idea of “sport diplomacy” and leaders modeling his calm, collected de-meanor.

From 2013 to 2014, UF’s online degree pro-
gram rocketed up 29 places in the U.S. News 
and World rankings.
Rankings released Wednesday marked UF 
ﬁ  fth nationwide in online undergraduate de-
grees, along with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical 
University. This is a jump from 34th last year.
UF also ranked ﬁ  rst in the state among 
public universities for online Bachelor’s de-gree programs, also tied with Embry-Riddle. 
Andrew McCollough, UF associate pro-
vost for teaching and technology, credits this 
rise to the new metrics used to rank the col-
leges. Other than the addition of peer rank-ings, scores were calculated based on student engagement, faculty credentials and training and student services and technology. 
This year, U.S. News based 20 percent of 
ﬁ  nal rankings on peer review. 
McCollough said the education industry sees UF as a recognized brand, which adds to the visibility and high-ranking of UF’s online programs.
The data collected by U.S. News and World 
was based on the two-plus-two program of-fered by the university, which allowed stu-dents to spend their last two years of college earning a degree online from UF, McCollough said.
“This is afﬁ  rmation we know how to de-
liver education online,” McCollough said.
The university’s new comprehensive 
four-year degree program, UF Online, also launched recently.
Some students, like Jessica Mandel, still 
prefer in-person classes. The 19-year-old UF advertising freshman said she found it harder to get help and manage her time in an online 
class.
“With classes, you just have to go,” Mandel 
said. “You have to be responsible and dedicat-
ed and set aside time for online classes.”
For Kelsey Willianson, an 18-year-old 
UF biochemistry freshman, the new rank-ing makes her less reluctant to take an online class.
“It makes me not as afraid to take a class 
online,” she said. “If I want to take a class but it’s full, I could still take it online.”8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 2014

The Alachua County Commission 
will vote Tuesday to accept or deny a 
$2 million grant awarded to Alachua County Fire Rescue.
The U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security’s Stafﬁ  ng for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response grant, worth more than $2 million, is designed to help de-partments employ more ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters. 
Bill Northcutt, deputy chief of opera-
tions at AFR, said the money will allow the department to respond more efﬁ  -ciently to emergencies. 
The grant would cover the salaries of 
22 additional ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters. 
With the money, ﬁ  retrucks respond-
ing to rural area emergencies will oper-ate with four ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters instead of the current two, he said. 
“It shows a need in the community 
that we are ready to ﬁ  ll,” Northcutt said.
If the Commission approves the 
grant, the department will be able to start hiring new employees 90 days later. 
Newly hired ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters who are 
military veterans will work a three-year paid term and non-veterans a two-year term.
Lee Pinkoson, an Alachua County 
commissioner, said the long-term effects 
of the grant may raise questions.
“This grant is a wonderful thing, but 
it only supplies pay for two years. The 
question we have is, ‘What will happen when the money runs out?’” he said. 
However, Pinkoson still expressed 
enthusiasm about the grant. 
He said it shows “an outstanding 
service organization in our county.”Commission to vote on

Another Southeastern Conference foe, another victory for 
the Gators. 
Florida (13-3, 3-0 SEC) edged out Arkansas 59-52 on Thurs-
day night. The Razorbacks’ 52 points are the fewest points an 
opponent has scored on the Gators this season, while UF’s 59 points tied the lowest score they have put up in 2013-14. 
“Really, really proud of the way we battled and fought,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. 
“I’m kind of a boring, after-game quote person because it 
seems like those are the same things that I keep saying, but that’s what I see in this team.”
For Florida’s past nine games, Butler’s sentiments have 
definitely rung true. 
The low-scoring night for both teams can be attributed to 
their subpar shooting percentages from the field. Florida shot 42 percent from the field (3 of 17 from beyond the arc) while 
Arkansas (14-2, 1-2 SEC) shot only 32.1 percent. 
“This is basketball against a good team,” Butler said. 
“Some nights they’re going to fall, some nights they’re not. 
But, we’re going to keep shooting them as long as they’re good shots.”
In the first half, coach Butler was urging her team to 
communicate with each other to maintain a solid defensive 
scheme.  
“I didn’t feel like we were doing a good job of sustaining 
our communication throughout each possession,” she said. 
“When we got deeper into the shot clock, we were just as-
suming too much of one another and not really making sure 
that we were just giving each other confidence with our voic-es. When you’re playing a team like (Arkansas) — with so many dynamic scorers and a really smart point guard like 
(Calli) Berna – the only way you can over come that,  even if 
you’re a great defensive team, is to make sure you’re taking 
throughout the possession.”

� GATORS NEARLY SQUANDERED 
LEAD AGAINST SOUTH CAROLINA.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
South Carolina is no Kansas. 
But the Gators learned a similar lesson 
during Wednesday’s 74-58 victory against the Gamecocks as they did when the Jay-hawks rolled into the O’Connell Center one 
month ago: Jumping out to an early lead 
does not put the game away.
No. 10 Florida appeared to be on its way 
to another blowout against South Carolina after forcing 15 turnovers and holding USC to 31.6 percent shooting in the first half. The Gators outscored the Gamecocks 14-1 in the 
first six minutes before tying their biggest 
lead of the first half with 4:08 remaining in the first 20 minutes after going up 32-14.
With 4:14 remaining in the first half 
against Kansas on Dec. 10, Florida also had a 32-14 lead that seemed like it would hold for the rest of the game.
But to the dismay of coach Billy Dono-
van, the Gators let their opponent inch back 
into the contest with sloppy offense and a 
lack of intensity.
The Jayhawks charged back within 
four points before eventually losing 67-61, and the Gamecocks chipped away at their Lethargic play hurting UFRecR uiting

Thursday was a busy day for UF’s 2014 
and 2015 recruiting classes. 
It started early Thursday morning when 
Jalen Tabor, Rivals’ No. 4 cornerback from 
the 2014 class, flipped his commitment from Arizona to Florida. Just eight days ago at the Under Armour All-America Game in St. Petersburg, the five-star prospect chose Arizona over Alabama — Florida was not among his announced choices. 
The 6-foot-1 Tabor, who hails from 
Friendship Collegiate Academy in Wash-ington, D.C., has the skillset to get a start-ing spot at corner as early as this fall, espe-cially with the departure of corners Marcus Roberson and Loucheiz Purifoy to the NFL Draft. 
Tabor’s flip may have had an affect on 
2015 four-star cornerback Tyrek Cole’s oral commitment. Cole committed to Florida State on Thursday at 8 p.m. via his Twit-ter account (@Cole_island). Cole chose FSU over Florida, West Virginia and Miami. 
Many expected Cole to end up at WVU, 
as his head coach from Miramar High, Da-mon Cogdell, accepted a position as an as-sistant coach on the West Virginia defensive staff on Wednesday.

When the UF track and ﬁ  eld team travels 
to Birmingham, Ala., for its season-opening 
indoor meet this afternoon, one thing will 
be stressed above all: consistency.
The men’s team is just the third program 
to win three consecutive indoor national 
titles (2010, 2011, 2012), while the women 
notched the crown once — in 1992.
After falling victim to 2013 indoor na-
tional champion Arkansas, Florida is pre-
paring to bring back the title this season with senior hurdler Eddie Lovett leading 
the way.
“They know that I’m here for the pro-
gression of the team period, men and women,” Lovett said. 
“As of right now, were all on the same 
page, and we’re heading into indoor start-
ing strong, and hopefully ... be (as) consis-
tent as we can.” 
Coach Mike Holloway is relying on his 
seniors to be the enforcers and create an 
atmosphere where the team is seen as one unit.
Both the men and women’s teams praise 
the idea of the squad being a family and neglect any type of separation. 
“I practice with the boys a lot this fall,” senior sprinter Ebony Eutsey said. “I deﬁ  -nitely think they pushed me to the point where I was just like, ‘Oh my God.’”
“They still push us in practice and even 
in class if you need help. The help is there. We push one another. 
“The motivation that they have for us is 
there, the determination they have for us is 
there, the focus is there. We’re just a family 
like [Holloway] said.”
Leadership is another characteristic the 
seniors have shown in preparation for Fri-day’s meet. 
Both Lovett and Eutsey see the impor-
tance of leading the rest of the team. 
Eutsey said she shows the underclass-
man the importance of being responsible — coming to practice on time, getting the right supplements and going to tutoring are duties she and others hold as seniors and leaders. 
Lovett tried to relate to his teammates 
by explaining his own faults.
“Last year, I felt like I’ve had pretty 
good consistency indoor, and somewhere towards outdoor, I maybe lost focus on the 
things I was focused on indoor,” Lovett 
said. 
“Bringing consistency and trying to in-
still that into my teammates and even on the women’s side, starting strong and ﬁ  n-
ishing strong.”
After scoring 59 points in the national 
championship last year, UF is fortunate to return the majority of those points in ath-
letes to start off the UAB Invite.
Junior jumper Marquis Dendy and 
sophomore sprinter Arman Hall were both 
named to the Bowerman Trophy men’s preseason watch list. 
Florida is the only team with two ath-
letes on the list.
UF strengthens its Bowerman legacy 
that includes an all-time best 59 watch list 
appearances, as Dendy made his sixth ap-pearance and Hall his ﬁ  rst.
The UAB Invite will start today in the late afternoon. It will host 40 teams throughout the two-day event.
Holloway seeks to start the season 
strong. 
“Overall, just very, very pleased with 
where the program is,” Holloway said. “Very pleased with the progress and we’re ready to get this thing started.”14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 2014

Florida has a legitimate shot at 
landing 2014 four-star defensive 
tackle Thomas Holley in the near 
future. 
Holley is orally committed to 
Penn State, but his recruiter, long-
time Penn State assistant Larry 
Johnson, could leave the program, 
according to an NBC10 Philadel-phia report. Johnson is currently the Nittany Lions’ interim head coach, ﬁ  lling in for Bill O’Brien, who was ofﬁ  cially introduced as the Houston Texans’ head coach on Jan. 2 after two seasons at 
PSU’s helm.
Johnson has been on Penn 
State’s staff since 1996. NBC10 
Philadelphia reported that John-
son was upset he did not get 
interviewed for the PSU head coaching job, and “his intention is to leave.” 
Reports emerged Thursday that current Vanderbilt head coach 
James Franklin would take over 
in Happy Valley as head coach. ESPN reported Thursday night that Franklin’s contract would be 
ﬁ  nalized by a Penn State commit-
tee on Saturday. 
Holley told Florida Sports Talk 
NBC Sports Radio on Dec. 31, 2013, that if he were to decommit 
from Penn State, he would highly 
consider going to UF.
In fact, it would be his ﬁ  rst 
choice.
“Florida is deﬁ  nitely a great 
school, and if I ever was [sic] to decommit and 
reconsider a school, it would be Florida,” Hol-ley said. 
“But we’ll 
wait and see what happens when we get to 
that bridge, but right now it’s 100 
percent Penn State.”
It appears that Holley is at 
that bridge, if reports of Johnson 
leaving Happy Valley prove to be 
true. Holley would be an impres-
sive pickup for UF and is skilled enough to make an impact on de-
fense soon. 
He is the No. 3 defensive tackle 
in the class and No. 2 ranked tack-
le from the state of New York, ac-
cording to Rivals.com. 
Holley, originally from Brook-
lyn, also said that being close to 
home is an important factor in his decision. 
The Gators’ depth at defensive 
tackle took a big hit with Domin-ique Easley’s departure to the 2014 NFL Draft.  If UF can snag Holley, 
it would be that much closer to 
ﬁ  lling the hole left by Easley.Potential coaching change gives Florida shot at four-star lineman

UF hurdlerFlorida offers four-star running back, quarterback scholarships
Florida picked up a three-star defen-
sive tackle commit for the 2015 class in 
Trinity Christian’s Deontai Williams, who announced his oral commitment to Florida on Thursday morning. He is currently the only commit in UF’s 2015 class. 
UF missed on Williams’ teammate, 
2015 defensive tackle Kendrick Norton, who announced his oral commitment to Florida State this morning. 
Norton is the No. 13 defensive tackle 
in the class, according to Rivals.com. 
2014 wide receiver Isaiah Ford, who 
decommitted from Louisville on Sun-day, narrowed down his choices to Lou-isville, Florida, South Carolina and Vir-ginia Tech on Thursday. 
Trinity outside linebacker Jeffrey 
Holland announced his college choices – Alabama, Auburn, Florida, Florida State, Ohio State and UCLA. Holland is the No. 4 outside linebacker in the 2015 class. 
Florida offers Powell, Harris: Four-star 2014 running back Brandon Powell, a Deerfield Beach High standout, was of-fered by UF on Wednesday. 
Powell was expected to enroll at Mi-
ami earlier this week but will now make a decision on Friday on where he will enroll, according to reports. 
Powell is the No. 7 running back in 
the class.
UF currently does not have a run-
ning back committed to the 2014 class, as it lost five-star tailback Dalvin Cook to Florida State. Cook announced his flip on Dec. 31, 2013.
The Gators also offered 2014 dual-
threat quarterback Treon Harris, an FSU oral commit, on Thursday.
Harris will take an official visit to 
Gainesville on Jan. 17. He is also sched-uled to make official visits to Auburn and Miami before the end of the month. Harris orally committed to FSU in July of 2013. 
A dual-threat quarterback like Harris 
would fit well into new Florida offen-sive coordinator Kurt Roper’s up-tempo spread offense. RecR uit , from page 13
With the score tied at 24 enter-
ing halftime, the Gators had to keep 
talking to one another in order to 
have a shot at keeping the winning 
streak alive. 
Sure enough, the Gators smoth-
ering defense shone brightly in the 
second half, holding Arkansas with-
out a field goal for more than nine 
minutes in the second half. 
“We played smarter defense, but 
that was probably the section of the 
game where we did the best job re-
bounding,” Butler said. 
Also in regards to smarter play, 
no Gator fouled out for the first time 
in conference play this season. 
January Miller, who led the 
team with four fouls, was a spark-plug throughout the game, earning 13 points and six rebounds on the night. 
“From a scoring standpoint, I 
thought we did a good job in the paint,” Butler said. 
“Rebounding, though, our effort 
could have been a little more consis-
tent.”
Arkansas narrowly won the re-
bounding battle 38-35, but the Razor-
backs did have a height advantage on the Gators — something Butler and Florida have grown used to. 
“There were some preventable 
plays that were based on not boxing out,” Butler said. 
“We’ve got to make that impor-
tant when we’re giving up height, which is just about every night.”W-Hoops , from page 13Miller fuels 
UF in seven-
point victory18-point deficit until it was as small as eight 
with 6:05 into the second half.
“I don’t know what it is, but we have a 
very, very hard time sustaining intensity,” Donovan said. “We inevitably let teams get 
back in games and we’re going to have to do 
something to get that resolved and corrected. I don’t know what the solution is, but it’s start-ing to become a theme ... and I’m starting to get irritated by it.” 
After opening the season with a 77-69 vic-
tory over North Florida, Donovan said the most disappointing factor was his team’s sense of entitlement and lack of motivation. 
Fast forward two months, the Gators are back 
at the No. 10 spot they started the season at, but they are still having trouble finding that energy Donovan wants them to have through-out a game.
Senior center Patric Young said his team 
felt content with the lead it took over South Carolina, which allowed the Gamecocks to storm back.
“We allow that human nature to kick in 
and us having that mindset of relaxing a little bit instead of having that killer mindset of keep pushing and pursuing greatness,” Young said. 
With Florida having four seniors, includ-
ing Young, it’s easy to place the blame on them for not keeping the team motivated throughout the game. But Donovan said it’s 
not necessarily all on them, but agreed with 
Young that there’s a fight within each player to play content and without energy. 
“Guys want to play in a comfortable place,” 
Donovan said. “They’ve got to battle that. They’ve got to have an awareness of that.”
Prather questionable for Saturday: Casey 
Prather (knee swelling) joins Scottie Wilbekin (sprained right ankle) as questionable for Flor-ida’s road matchup with Arkansas on Satur-day, UF announced Thursday evening. 
Prather, the Gators’ leading scorer this 
season, woke up Thursday morning with a swollen right knee, which kept him out of practice.
Donovan said in a school release that the 
senior forward did not injure his knee in Wednesday’s win and that the swollenness “came out of nowhere.” Prather was sched-uled to undergo tests Thursday night. FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida ended the 2013 sea-
son in Los Angeles ranked No. 1 
in the country after ﬁ  nishing .200  
points better than Oklahoma in 
the NCAA Super Six.
On Saturday night at 10 
p.m., the Gators will begin the 
2014 season in Los Angeles, still 
ranked No. 1.
The Gators have fond mem-
ories of the Pauley Pavilion, where they will compete against 
UCLA after walking off the ﬂ  oor 
as national champions.
Coach Rhonda Faehn is no 
stranger to the arena.
A UCLA graduate, Faehn 
competed with the Bruins gym-nastics team from 1990 to 1992. She served as a student assis-tant for two years after until she 
graduated from the university in 
1994. 
“It always great to be able to 
go back to the school that I at-
tended and see a lot of former 
teammates and coaches,” Faehn said. 
Faehn will reunite with Valo-
rie Kondos Field, her former 
coach who has been coaching 
the Bruins since 1991. Though the Bruins and Gators 
are not strangers, this is their ﬁ  rst dual meet since 2005. UF last competed against UCLA, among other teams, in the NCAA ﬁ  nals. 
The Bruins placed fourth in the 
Super Six, while the Gators land-ed in ﬁ  rst place. 
“I think that this team deﬁ  -
nitely has gained a lot of conﬁ  -
dence from their experience last 
year and last season,” Faehn said. 
Freshmen Claire Boyce and 
Silvia Colussi-Paleaz may not have the conﬁ  dence that comes with winning a national champi-onship, but Faehn said they are ready to compete.
“We really just try and put 
them in as many pressure situ-ations as possible,” Faehn said. “But nothing can prepare them 
for it, except for getting out there 
and competing. We really usu-ally try and start them out a little slower and not overwhelm them so that they can gain conﬁ  dence 
little bit by little bit.”
Boyce will likely compete in 
two or three events, Faehn said 
at practice Tuesday.
“She has always been ex-
ceptional in being consistent,” Faehn said. “I see her as a great, 
solid, calm competitor. Hopeful-
ly we’ll see that throughout the season with her.”
Colussi-Paleaz will possibly 
compete in two events. Faehn added that if the two do not compete in Los Angeles, they will deﬁ  nitely exhibition their routines to gain much-needed 
collegiate gymnastics experi-
ence.
Sophomore Bridget Sloan, 
junior Kytra Hunter and senior 
Mackenzie Caquatto will com-
pete in all four events against UCLA, Faehn said.
Sloan set her career-best all 
around record last year with a 
39.75 on March 1 against Min-
nesota — a performance she re-peated twice more in 2013. 
Also at Florida’s home meet 
against Minnesota, Hunter set a career and UF record of 39.8 in all-around. Caquatto did not compete as an all-arounder at any of the Gators’ regular season 
or postseason meets in 2013. 
“It’s just a start,” Faehn said 
of the opener. “It’s an opportuni-
ty for our athletes to gain experi-
ence, try new routines and just to 
get out there and get it going.”
