When Stephanie Cruz heard 
the 2014 lineup for Gator Growl, 
she screamed.
“It kinda brings me back to 
the music we listened to in mid-
dle school,” said the 20-year-old 
UF computer science junior.
Gator Growl’s 2014 lineup 
of Foster the People, Ludacris and Brooks Wheelan has UF students and Gator fans alike excited.
The annual pep rally will be 
Oct. 17 at 6 p.m. on Flavet Field, 
a new venue for the event that 
has taken place in the Swamp for the last 82 years.
The event, the nation’s larg-
est student-run pep rally, will include local food trucks, the traditional ﬁ  reworks display and a six-foot wind screen around Flavet Field, said Devin McDaniel, executive producer of Gator Growl.
Attendees will also be asked 
not to bring lawn chairs or um-brellas, so as not to obstruct the 
view for others, she said.
Tickets are available on the 
Gator Growl website and run 
$15 for students, $25 for non-student general admission and $40 for bleacher seating.
Student Government Pro-
duction and Florida Blue Key did not provide information 
about the speciﬁ  c fees for each 
performer.

A semitrailer hit a car carrying 
ﬁ  ve current and former UF stu-
dents early Sunday morning near 
Wildwood, Florida, killing one 
and injuring others. 
Emily Aultman, a 19-year-old 
UF psychology junior, was driv-ing a Ford Explorer after midnight with four other people to visit one of their friends in Orlando. 
At about mile marker 304 on 
the Florida Turnpike, a semi-trailer in the right lane started to merge into the left lane where they were driving, said passenger 
McKenzie Lentz, a 23-year-old 
UF alumna.  
“We swerved so that it wouldn’t hit us,” Lentz said. “The car ﬁ  shtailed, and then it started to ﬂ  ip.”
The Explorer ﬂ  ipped about 
three times, she said, before stop-ping on its roof in the right lane. 
Lentz and another passenger 
were able to escape before a dif-
ferent semitrailer hit the Explorer 
head on. 
“I thought we had all gotten out, but when I looked back, we weren’t all out of the car,” Lentz said. 
According to a report by the 
Florida Highway Patrol, the 
semitrailer struck the Explorer on the driver’s side, and emergency 
responders pronounced Aultman dead at the scene. 
Lentz said everyone was trans-
ported to the hospital, and the survivors received treatment for their injuries. All but one passen-ger, whose ribs were fractured, have been discharged. 
As of press time, funeral ar-
rangements have not been ﬁ  nal-ized for Aultman.

TANIMA MEHROTRA

When Paola Aguirre imagined her wed-
ding day, she didn’t think it would take place 
in a house she had never stepped foot in.
Because of Florida’s ban on same-sex mar-
riage, Aguirre and her partner, Lorna Brace-
well, were forced to travel elsewhere to tie the 
knot. 
The couple packed into a car with Brace-well’s parents and a pastor and drove to Il-linois, where their relationship received legal recognition. 
“It kind of felt like we were kids sneak-
ing off to do something wrong,” Aguirre, a 29-year-old teacher at The One Room School House Project, said. 
When a judge in Florida overturned the 
state’s ban in Monroe County last Thursday, 
allowing legal marriages to begin today, Agu-
irre was overcome with joy. Florida is one of 31 states that currently bans same-sex marriage.
“A wedding is about being socially rec-ognized as a couple and having people you love support your relationship,” Aguirre said. “Our situation isn’t unique.”
“The court is aware that the majority of 
voters oppose same-sex marriage, but it is our country’s proud history to protect the rights of the individual, the rights of the unpopular and rights of the powerless, even at the cost of of-fending the majority,” Monroe County Circuit 
Judge Luis Garcia wrote in his opinion.
Not everyone was happy about the ruling.
Attorney General Pam Bondi ﬁ  led an ap-
peal almost immediately after, putting Gar-cia’s ruling on hold. 
“The fundamental argument of our brief is 
that the voters had the right (in 2008) to adopt this deﬁ  nition of marriage (between a man and a woman), just as they have the right in the future to change their minds and afford le-gal recognition to same-sex marriage, should they so choose,” Bondi said in a statement re-leased by her ofﬁ  ce. 
“As attorney general, it’s her job to defend 
the Florida Constitution,” said Kailyn Allen, chair woman of the UF College Republicans

“It’s a basic love experi-

themselves, blow bubbles and hand out flowers to passers-by. “With the world at war, we lose sight of some of the simpler things life has to offer,” he said.

sought to mix up how Greek voters impacted elections. A bill was shot down that would have switched fraternity and sorority districts from off-campus, voting for 30 seats, to on-campus, voting for only two seats. Opponents of the bill thought that because Greeks 
paid their own expenses they 
should fall under off-campus. Proponents, including Presi-dent Scooter Willis, said they live on UF land and therefore shouldn’t be allowed to con-tinue controlling the vote in off-
campus elections.

Raise ‘Em
The audience raises its hands during Cheryl McFadden and Karen Johnson’s rendition of “Why We 
Sing.” The event, When Gospel Meets Jazz, was held at the Thomas Center on Saturday.
The United Church of Gainesville held a celebration with cake
chapter. 
As of Monday morning, Judge Garcia de-
nied an emergency motion to lift the stay filed 
by the original lawyers behind the Monroe County lawsuit, which would have allowed 
marriages to take place until the appeal was 
dealt with. 
Joseph Jackson, a legal skills professor at 
Levin College of Law, expects the case could go to the Florida Supreme Court for a more definitive decision that would apply state-
wide. Jackson referenced similar cases in other 
states such as Utah and Oklahoma, which are 
pending in the U.S Supreme Court. 
Despite the uncertainty of what will hap-
pen next, Garcia’s ruling triggered a wave of celebration in Gainesville. 
At an event organized by the United 
Church of Gainesville that same day, several gathered to receive the news with excitement, champagne and cake that read “love wins.”Mallory Garner-Wells, public policy direc-
tor of Equality Florida, an organization that 
advocates for gay and lesbian rights and leads 
a North Florida lawsuit for gay marriage, said 
at the event that Garcia’s decision was a “re-ally good first step.”
“This ruling sends a strong message that 
judges here have come to the same conclu-sion that judges have ruled in other states: that marriage equality needs to be the law of the land,” Garner-Wells said. 
As for the appeal, Garner-Wells said Bondi will “have to stand in court knowing that she’s not on the right side of history.”
Terry Fleming, co-president of the Pride 
Community Center of North Central Florida, spoke about what struck him most regarding the text of Garcia’s ruling: the sweeping nature of the language and the tie-in to historic cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson.
“All of these were extremely important cas-
es in the advancement of human rights,” Flem-ing, 53, said. “If that doesn’t make the hair on your arms rise, I don’t know what will.”

of the show and we sponsored all of 
the talent and associated fees up to $242,000,” wrote Bradley Wheeler, SGP co-chairman, in an email.
Cruz has not been to any of the 
other Gator Growls during her time at UF, due to scheduling conflicts and acts that did not interest her.
But the new lineup “definitely 
motivates (her) to go,” she said, if only because she may have the chance to interact with the perform-ers. The move to Flavet Field is meant to create a more intimate en-vironment with the talent, but it also reflects a decline in ticket sales over the years and is a cheaper venue for Gator Growl organizers.
Although the stadium can seat 
90,000, ticket sales plummeted to about 20,000 in 2012 and fell to 15,000 in 2013, according to Alliga-tor archives. In order to drive those numbers back up, McDaniel said her group wants to “reinvent the wheel” in terms of Gator Growl as an event.
“A typical pep rally is something 
you get involved in,” she said.
McDaniel said her team wants to 
make Gator Growl more of an event than a show.
“We have a few more tricks up 
our sleeves,” she said.

Two men jumped an officer 
after fighting near Shuck Raw 
Bar and Seafood Restaurant early Saturday morning.
Gainesville Police arrested 
and charged local brothers Richard James Shaw, 27, and Christopher Lee Shaw, 32, for battery on an officer and fight-ing in a public place.
The officer found Richard 
and Christopher fighting near Midtown. She tried to break up the fight, but Richard turned 
around and pushed her with 
both hands, according to the report. He then grabbed the of-ficer’s left upper arm with his left hand. 
“As (the officer) tried to de-
tain him he shoved her with two open hands in her chest to get away,” GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.  
When the officer was hand-
cuffing Richard on the ground, Christopher “jumped on her back and began hitting her in an effort to free his brother,” Tobias said. “With the assis-
tance from the Shucks bounc-
ers, (the officer) was able to restrain (Christopher) also,” Tobias said. 
After questioning, both 
Richard and Christopher had nothing to say. 
Officers booked Richard 
into the Alachua County Jail on 
Saturday at 2:14 a.m. He was 
released Sunday at 12:42 a.m. after meeting bond.

topher into the Alachua County Jail on Saturday at 2:42 a.m. He was released Saturday at 8:06 p.m. after meeting bond. Brothers arrested in

The Longest Handy Ever didn’t 
last very long.
On Saturday, five contestants 
gathered around a five-and-a-half 
foot long inflatable penis — adorned 
with a Sharpie smiley face — to 
compete in the “Longest Handy Ever Contest,” sponsored by X-Mart at 3510 SW 13th St.
The last contestant with his or her 
hand firmly affixed to the air-filled phallus won a goody bag of more than $250 worth of sex toys, lingerie and sexual supplements.
At about 1:10 p.m., five contes-
tants circled the penis, set up on a white display shelf festooned with red ribbons and blue-and-white streamers. Contest organizer and store manager Sam Collins, 33,  warns contestants that they may not leave for any reason, and the last hand on the penis wins the prize. The contest begins.
Eight minutes later, the first con-
testant leaves to walk her dog.
Collins, who has been working 
at X-Mart for three years and for the company for eight years, asks the remaining group various questions, ranging from what video games they’re currently playing to their fa-vorite sex position.
As the contestants chat and lean 
on the slowly deflating shaft, Collins helps customers — mostly couples 
— who wander through the store. 
He calls himself a relationship reha-bilitation specialist.“I help people,” he says. “We 
change the world, one orgasm at a time.”
Two contestants, Kyle Savery, 19, 
and Pedro Gonzales, 19, drove from Jacksonville for this competition. 
Savery, who studies education at 
Florida State College at Jacksonville smokes, but he assures the small 
crowd that he “isn’t a chain smok-
er,” so he won’t be distracted. 
Gonzales, who studies network 
security at FSCJ, watches “Saving Private Ryan” on his phone.
Katrina “Kat” Gottschalch, 25, 
lets her competitors know she’s here for the long run. 
“I have nothing better to do to-
day,” she says. “I’ll sit here until 8. I don’t care.”
Gottschalch studies nursing at Santa Fe College by day and works at Winn-Dixie by night. 
Her roommate, Holden Howard, 
23, also has his hand on the now considerably limp penis. He, like all the others, heard about this competi-tion from an employee, and not the Facebook event to which 30 people RSVP’d. He works retail and moon-
lights as a DJ two nights a week.
At 2 p.m. Howard lets go and 
wanders away.
Gonzales and Savery realize they 
have not eaten all day and begin 
planning a trip to Satchel’s Pizza.
Gottschalch seizes the opportu-
nity and proposes a solution: She wins the competition and shares the 
goodies.
With visions of pepperoni and 
cheese in their heads, the remaining competitors agree and drop out —  a 
mere hour after the competition be-gan.
Cheering, Gottschalch takes the 
opportunity to swing the inflated penis around and pose with it be-fore examining her prize. She unzips a large black duffel bag to reveal pornography, nipple clamps and a 
vibrating dildo mounted on a black 
bouncy ball. She pulls each item out and squeals with excitement.
“I feel like Santa with a sack full 
of presents,” she laughs. 
Gottschalch shares the booty 
among the four competitors, who all seem to be satisfied with their loot.
“I feel, although it is a loss, that 
we all benefited,” Gonzales says.
Savery shrugs.“I was ready for pizza,” he says.

marriage denial 
shows importance 
of the vote
For a brief moment at the end of last week, it seemed that 
Florida would claim a victory in the ﬁ  ght for gay rights. On Thursday, Monroe County Circuit Court Judge Luis Gar-
cia overturned Florida’s 2008 ban on gay marriage and ordered that the two men who appealed for a marriage license, along 
with all other gay couples, be allowed to wed. 
“The court is aware that the majority of voters oppose same-
sex marriage, but it is our country’s proud history to protect the 
rights of the individual, the rights of the unpopular and rights of the powerless, even at the cost of offending the majority,” Garcia wrote in his opinion, according to the Tampa Bay Times. 
However, the elation of this victory was cut short. Florida 
Attorney General Pam Bondi quickly appealed Garcia’s ruling, and in doing so, triggered an automatic stay in the case. Garcia 
was asked yesterday to lift the stay, but he denied the request. 
Bondi’s ofﬁ  cial statement regarding the case concluded that the Supreme Court issued orders staying all lower-court gay-mar-riage decisions. 
“They have all acted to maintain the status quo while the is-
sues presented are resolved,” her statement reads. “This court should likewise maintain the status quo and leave the automatic stay in place until further appellate proceedings are conclud-ed.”
We can ﬂ  ing accusations at Pam Bondi all we want — that 
she hates gay people, that she’s on the wrong side of history, etc. But at the end of the day, whether you agree with her or not, she’s doing her job: In 2008, Florida voters approved a same-sex marriage ban that, well, bans gay marriage. Though this edito-rial board adamantly disagrees with the ban, it would appear that Bondi is simply defending what’s written in the state con-stitution. 
The ban has been appealed since its implementation. Law-
suits challenging the ban are currently pending in Miami-Dade County and Tallahassee as the cases move toward the Supreme Court, and Bondi’s statements this week have proved that no progress will be made for gay couples until a higher court over-turns the ban. 
In the meantime, what can you, the individual, do? Florida’s 
political climate seems ripe for change when it comes to gay mar-riage: According to the Miami Herald, 54 percent of Floridians now support the freedom to marry. Equality Florida is working

stereos annoy you?Today’s question: Will you go to this year’s Gator 
Growl?Mouthing off to oral sex stereotypes
Call me a traditionalist, but I don’t normally take sex 
advice from Greek life-inspired websites. 
So last month, when Total Frat Move and Total So-
rority Move had a back-and-forth argument over oral sex, I didn’t really pay it much mind. 
But just like with most things, you don’t pay attention to 
it until it’s gone. 
Which is why when I started hooking up with someone 
new and oral sex wasn’t involved, I cared a lot more about TFM’s “Why Guys Should Not Be Required To Go Down On Girls” article. 
To be fair, the TSM rebuttal article had it right by saying, 
“No one should be required to do anything, sexually.” 
It’s not a requirement, but fellatio and cunnilingus are on 
equal footing — mouthing? — with “good morning” texts or home-cooked meals as far as sending the, “You’re a great person, and I care about you,” message. 
And while a “Congratulations on passing your organic 
chemistry ﬁ  nal” blowjob is great, oral sex shouldn’t be re-served for celebrations, nor should it be consistently one-sided.
I’m a big believer in the “you scratch my back, I scratch 
yours” principle. Except in this case, replace “scratch” with 
“lick” and “back” with “genitals.”
You already learned this in different words in kinder-
garten, and it can be applied to oral sex, too. Let me remind 
you of the golden rule — treat others as you would like to be treated.
We’re talking about oral, however, so by the transitive 
property, the golden rule of sex would be, “Go down on oth-ers like you would like to be gone down upon.” 
If your partner goes down on you and spends however 
many minutes solely focusing on getting you off, it’s polite to do the same. 
It doesn’t have to be at the same time, or even the same 
night — or morning, or afternoon, or whenever you’re get-ting lucky — but one partner shouldn’t be the one to always give.
If you don’t normally go down, at least put the offer on 
the table. If your partner isn’t interested in your offer to head south, but he or she does on a regular basis, consider repaying him or her with another method of stimulation — try digital sex, or indulge a fantasy of theirs. 
Because, to be fair, giving head 
isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, nor is it for every couple.
I get it, I really do. Nothing is 
more personal than oral sex. And 
that’s saying something because you know what regular sex is, right?
But really, oral sex is 10 times more intimate. You literally 
have your face all up in your partner’s nether region. 
Despite being a base before home run, oral ranks way 
higher on the list of “things I don’t want to do with someone I don’t know all that well.”
I asked a male friend what his policy for what TFM calls 
“muff munching” — add it to your vocabulary as you see ﬁ  t — and he said that he doesn’t like to do it because of sexually transmitted diseases.
More speciﬁ  cally, he said he’d eat a girl out by date ﬁ  ve, 
but not for a one-night stand. 
That makes sense, which is why this goes out speciﬁ  cally 
to consistent hook ups, friends with beneﬁ  ts, people who can actually make a relationship work or whomever may be in a trusting relationship.
While there’s no scientiﬁ  c study to back me up on this, 
it’s almost guaranteed that your partner will appreciate your oral efforts. That appreciation goes a long way in getting you better sex. If you go down on your partner for so long that he or she cannot remember his or her own name, you’re going 
to get some Grade-A sex later on.
And really, you should want to please your partner, any-
way. If you’re not in a relationship where you can cede your 
own pleasure for a few minutes in order to use your mouth to make your partner’s eyes roll back and toes curl, maybe you’re not sleeping with the right person.

Because the political right is 
full of an interesting bunch of characters, many in the media 
struggle to properly identify and categorize its different ideological camps. The right is said to be made up of mainstream, business-friend-ly, Tea Party, libertarian, neoconser-vative, religious-minded or simply extremist groups. 
Every now and again, a brave writer attempts 
to organize this disarray. Recently, Buzzfeed’s Ben Smith gave it a try. 
Smith’s proposal: Divide the conservative 
movement in two. Call one side the “Liberty Conservatives” and the other, “Freedom Con-servatives.” The former “draws on a straight line that runs from the Declaration to modern libertarianism” and the latter “goes from eman-cipation to George W. Bush, with a rather incon-venient detour through Roosevelt.” The Free-dom Conservatives are more likely to support the legalization of marijuana, while the Liberty Conservatives are more likely to support the in-tervention in Iraq. 
Even thought it seems like this is a practi-
cal proposal, the categorization takes a turn for the worse. Smith begins to delve into the roots and deﬁ  nitions of the words “liberty” and “free-dom.” One has a “Germanic root,” and the other has a “Latin one,” obviously, and he discusses their distinct connotations. This is ﬁ  ne and dan-dy, but these two words have been used inter-changeably so often that they lose their unique meanings that lend to Smith’s proposal.     
If these monikers stuck, havoc on the right 
would ensue. I can see men with furled “Don’t Tread on Me” ﬂ  ags getting into arguments over which Founding Father would fall into which category. Did Jefferson champion freedom over liberty, or the other way around? It makes you wonder.  
Then comes the inevitable question: Which 
would Reagan be? He touted individual liberty, and he did like freedom. Members on the right will take sides of this all-too-important quanda-ry and a civil war will rage. 
In a more practical case, consider what cat-
egory former Sen. Rick Santorum would fall into. He is predominantly known as a reli-gious conservative, which would easily make him a Liberty Conservative. But then again, he holds dear the free market in a way that would qualify him as a Freedom Conservative. While you jostle with the Freedom versus Liberty distinction, you completely lose sight of what makes Santorum, Santorum. 
Smith’s two camps are too broad 
and contrast too little. These terms improperly classify conservatives, and you would have to be crazy to believe that a person would identify 
himself or herself in Smith’s terms. 
Years before Smith, Irving Kristol, the intel-
lectual leader and godfather of the neoconserva-tive movement, tried in vain to categorize the right. In one of his essays, Kristol separates the right into three rows: the traditional, religious and neoconservatives. 
Traditional conservatives are more libertari-
an-leaning and anti-statist. They are more prone to being cozy with the business community be-cause the opposite of the public sector is the pri-vate sector. 
Religious conservatives are just as the name 
implies: They rely on a predominantly Judeo-Christian disposition. Vices, like marijuana legalization, the deterioration of “traditional” marriage and gambling are frowned upon. The state, in their view, must pass ethical and moral laws that must align with religious tradition and tenant.  
Neoconservatives are disenfranchised New 
Dealers. These conservatives were content with bigger government but ultimately defected from the left because of Lyndon Johnson’s unrealistic Great Society initiative. They have a grandiose view of American inﬂ  uence and are better iden-tiﬁ  ed by their hawkish views on foreign policy. 
As with Smith’s proposal, Kristol’s categories 
lack proper individuality. George W. Bush was a foreign policy hawk, which had much to do with his strong religious convictions. Nice try, and thanks for playing. 
Even though this is a nice little pastime the 
media like to play, no writer can properly sep-arate the right so neatly. There is no point in doing this. By reducing the right wing into re-dundant and ineffectual camps, you lose sight of its diverse political thought. These inaccu-rate views of the right actually gives the right its strength. It leads to a robust internal policy debate and a healthier political movement. Per-haps we should focus more on that instead of camp drawing.

“But Jesus said, ‘Let 
the little children come to me and do 
not hinder them, for to such belongs the king-
dom of heaven.’” Matthew 19:14.
As little children come across 
our southern border seeking safety 
from the violence and deprava-tions of their home countries, I am 
shocked and deeply dismayed at 
the response of some in the media. 
American talk show host Laura In-
graham said we should deport them by the thousands. Fox News Chan-
nel TV show host Judge Jeanine 
Pirro said our safety is at risk, and 
we are in danger. Steve Doocy, a Fox 
news personality, said they could be members of gangs. These same pun-
dits are often the ﬁ  rst ones to claim 
America is a Christian country.
And I never thought I would see 
the day when a U.S. congressman would stand up on the ﬂ  oor of the 
House of Representatives and sug-
gest that we treat small children as 
an “invading force” and authorize 
military force against them, as Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert did. These are 
children – alone, hungry and afraid 
– that they are talking about. What 
kind of people turn their backs on a 
lost child? 
How did these children get here, 
and why are they here? I don’t know the answer, but common sense tells 
me they most likely did not walk the 
thousand miles from El Salvador 
and Guatemala through Mexico in 
a vast exodus to America. They are 
probably the orphans and street chil-
dren who have been displaced here 
by their home countries to avoid the 
responsibility of caring for them. We should look at this as a 
blessing. Yes, a blessing. The opportunity to save 50,000 children from a life of poverty, starva-
tion and untold deprivation has been placed, literally, at our door.
What should we do? The ﬁ  rst 
thing we should do is take them in, feed them and clothe them. We 
should give them medical care, 
comfort them and teach them. The 
last thing we should do is shout at 
them, frighten them and turn them away. We should act like compas-
sionate Americans, not bullies. I am 
utterly shocked at the inhuman dis-
plays on television of people shout-
ing and screaming epithets at small children. We should hold in con-
tempt those in the media and gov-
ernment who seek to demagogue 
a humanitarian crisis for their own 
political purposes. 
The next thing we should do is 
make our best efforts to identify the children, determine whether they 
have parents or families that can 
care for them, and, if they do, return them to their families. Given the cir-
cumstances, I doubt there are many 
of them who have families that 
can care for them. For those who 
have no families to care of them, 
we should build a community for 
them, educate them, care for them 
and make them available for adop-
tion. What we should never do is 
turn our backs to helpless children 
or send them back to developing 
countries to face lives of poverty 
and deprivation.

A mosquito-borne virus that  has recently caused epi-
demics in the Caribbean has made its way to Alachua 
County.
There has been one conﬁ  rmed case of the chikungu-
nya virus in Alachua County, wrote Paul Myers, admin-
istrator of the Alachua County Health Department, in an 
email. The person contracted it during a recent trip to the Caribbean.
Myers said he doesn’t believe the infected person will 
transmit the virus to anyone else. Transmission of the virus is most likely to happen several days after a person becomes ill, and this window of time had already passed by the time the person came back to Florida, he said.  
The virus is not passed from person to person, but 
rather, from mosquitoes to people. The person with the virus was isolated from exposure to mosquitoes upon returning to Alachua County, he said.
There have been 81 cases of the virus in Florida since 
the beginning of this year, according to a report by CBS Miami.
The symptoms of the virus include a sudden fever, 
severe joint pain and a headache, according to the World Health Organization website. The virus is rarely fatal.
There is no known vaccine available for the virus, 
and only rest and pain-relieving medication are recom-mended to treat symptoms.Roxanne Connelly, a professor of entomology at UF, 
said Asian Tiger and Yellow Fever mosquitoes typically carry the virus. The virus poses a risk to the people liv-
ing in Florida because at least one of these two kinds of 
mosquitoes is prevalent in every county in Florida, she said.
Nathan Burkett-Cadena, an assistant professor of 
mosquito ecology at UF, said local transmission of the virus occurs when an infected person gets bitten by a mosquito, which can then bite and infect another person who has no history of traveling to an area of active trans-mission, such as the Caribbean. 
 “It is notable that it turned up in the Caribbean be-
cause we (the Caribbean and Florida) basically share the same air space,” Burkett-Cadena said. “There’s lots of travel between Caribbean nations and Florida, speciﬁ  -cally.”Caribbean virus in Alachua County
Tips to protect you from mosquitoes
• Wear repellent.
• Make sure there are no open containers in back-
yards, which can hold water and become places where mosquitoes can reproduce.
• Mosquitoes go through their life cycles much more 
quickly during warmer temperatures and are there-
fore more abundant.

TALLAHASSEE — Tal-
lahassee police say a Florida 
State University profes-
sor was the intended target 
when murdered at his home last week. Investigators have no suspects and are asking 
for tips from the public.
Ofﬁ  cers found College of 
Law professor Dan Markel 
on Friday morning with an apparent gunshot wound. 
He later died at the hospital.
Police Chief Michael De-
Leo said the investigation 
showed no signs of a bur-glary or robbery and added, “There is no evidence this was a random act.”
Markel primarily taught 
criminal law after graduating from Harvard Law School in 2001.
Police are looking for wit-
nesses and asking anyone in the area of the 2100 block of Trescott Drive on Friday be-tween 10 a.m. and noon to 
call 850-891-4462.Police: Florida State

Max Garcia and the

Former Gator Tim Tebow is working out with NFL players in Scottsdale, Ariz. His regiment includes a modified game of volleyball using a 10-pound medicine ball.Teeing Off
Sophomore Vernon Hargreaves III was named to the 2014 Walter Camp Player of the Year watch list on Friday. The UF cornerback is just one of five sophomores on the list of 50 players across the country. JORDAN MCPHERSON

DeVon Walker’s season is over before it even 
started.
The junior swingman, who had the opportu-
nity to compete for a starting job or at least sixth-
man minutes at the small forward position, suf-fered a torn ACL and will likely seek a medical redshirt for the 2014-15 season.
After making minimal contributions in his 
freshman campaign — averaging 0.8 points per game in 25 appearances with a team-worst .182 field goal percentage — Walker improved in his second year with the Gators.
The Winter Haven, Fla., native made seven 
starts last season and saw his minutes more than triple from his freshman year. Walker finished fourth on the team in blocked shots (13) and 
three-pointers made (19).
Walker had career days early in the season 
against Southern and Middle Tennessee State. Af-
ter scoring just four points in the first three games of the year, he scored 20 points on a combined 
.429 shooting clip against the Jaguars and the Blue 
Raiders, joining Patric Young and Casey Prather as the only two UF players to produce double-digit point totals in both games.
With Walker out of the mix, Florida’s starting 
small forward spot will likely be between redshirt junior Dorian Finney-Smith and incoming fresh-man Devin Robinson to start the season.
Finney-Smith is the reigning Southeastern 
Conference Sixth Man of the Year after averag-

Sophomore Savannah Jordan saw 
success on the field for Florida in the 
2013 season, but she’s seen even more 
success with the U.S. Under-20 Na-
tional Team.
On Thursday, Jordan was named 
to the roster for the FIFA U-20 World 
Cup.
The matches will begin Aug. 5 and 
last until Aug. 24 throughout four 
Canadian cities against 15 other na-tions.
The freshman joins 20 other play-
ers for the World Cup representing a total of 12 states.The U.S. Under-20 coach, Michelle 
French, named the team roster after the first week of a two-week train-ing camp for the U-20 team, but the 
search for the right players took more 
than a year.
“The investment 
that players put in has paid off for 
them,” French said. 
“Some players have 
been in longer than others, but for play-
ers that have been in 
for a short period of 
time to come in and make that big of an impact and to make this roster is exciting for our team and it’s exciting 
for our country.”UF soccer star earns spot

LAWRENCE LAGUNA
Alligator Writer @LagunaLawrence
Despite failing to be selected during the 
NBA Draft, Patric Young still managed to make 
his dream of playing in the NBA come true.
After a five-game stint with the New Or-
leans Pelicans summer-league team in Las Ve-gas, Young signed a two-year offer from the 
team on Saturday.
“It’s a blessing to announce that I signed 
a contract with the New Orleans Pelicans,” Young said via his Twitter account (BigPatY-
oung4). “Thank you to everyone that support-
ed me.”
Throughout summer league play, the Jack-sonville native averaged 7.4 points and eight rebounds while starting four of five contests and playing 25.2 minutes per game.
Young averaged more rebounds in the sum-
mer league than he did last season with Florida 
(6.2).
The Pelicans took notice of his improv-
ing play and development and rewarded the 6-foot-9 big man with a NBA roster spot.
“I thought he was great. He was one of more 
consistent guys,” Pelicans summer head coach 
Bryan Gates said according to NBA.com “He 
really held the defensive boards down for us.”
Having the chance to play at the profession-
al level motivated Young to perform at an ex-ceptional level during summer-league play in

DALLAS — Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby had a 
dire warning Monday for anyone who likes intercollegiate 
athletics the way they are now.
“You’re going to hate it going forward,” Bowlsby said. 
“There’s a lot of change coming.”
During his opening address at the Big 12 football media 
days, Bowlsby talked about growing ﬁ  nancial constraints 
athletic programs face going forward and the “strange en-
vironment” that exists with class-action lawsuits against the NCAA and its member schools.
Bowlsby said he doesn’t think there is a real under-
standing of how much lawsuits — which he numbered as 
seven and “growing all the time” — could radically alter 
things.
“I think all of that in the end will cause programs to 
be eliminated. I think you’ll see men’s Olympic sports go 
away as a result of the new funding challenges that are 
coming down the pike,” he said. “I think there may be ten-sion among and between sports on campus and institu-tions that have different resources.”
While acknowledging the outcomes are unknown, the 
former Stanford athletic director expressed concern about fewer opportunities for some athletes to go to college in the future.
“I fear that we will get past the change and then we’ll 
realize that all the gymnastics programs went away, or that we have agents on campus all the time negotiating play-ing time for student athletes,” he said. “There’s all kind of Armageddon scenarios you could come up with . . . You wouldn’t have to be a very good ﬁ  ction writer to come up with some scenarios that would be pretty scary.”
A year ago, Bowlsby’s opening address was part of a 
coordinated effort by the leaders of the power conferences — the Big 12, SEC, Big Ten, Pac-12 and ACC — in calling for transformative changes in the governance system of the NCAA.
The NCAA board of directors is set to vote Aug. 7 on 
a proposal to give schools in the highest-proﬁ  le confer-ences more inﬂ  uence over college rules. The proposal also would give athletic directors and athletes bigger roles in 
the legislative process, and give the power conferences au-
tonomy to make their own bylaws.
That vote will come a day after the Big 12 sponsors in 
New York will meet in the ﬁ  rst of a scheduled series of forums on the state of college athletics.
When addressing potential unionization of football and 
basketball players, Bowlsby said “student-athletes are not employees. They should never be employees. It’s not an employee/employer relationship.”
Bowlsby also addressed the NCAA enforcement pro-
gram, which he said “is broken” considering there were no hearings before the infractions committee in almost a year even though he doesn’t believe cheating is rampant.
“I think it’s not an understatement to say cheating pays 
presently,” he said “If you seek to conspire to certainly bend the rules, you can do it successfully and probably not get caught in most occasions . . . They’re in a battle with a BB gun in their hand. They’re ﬁ  ghting howitzers.”Big 12 Commissioner predicts changes

Union basketball team.Alex Murphy, a transfer from 
Duke, could also vie for starting 
time in the second half of the sea-son. Due to NCAA transfer rules, Murphy will be ineligible to com-
pete until December.
Murphy, the brother of former 
Florida and current Utah Jazz pow-
er forward Erik Murphy, made 36 appearances during his tenure at 
Duke, including ﬁ  ve before decid-
ing to transfer to UF on Dec. 18.

Team player Abby Wam-bach.
The Fayetteville, Ga., na-
tive picked up accolades that made her a nationally known player. 
She was named Soccer 
America Freshman of the Year and the National Rookie of the Year by topdrawersoc-cer.com
Jordan was also named 
the Southeastern Conference Offensive Player of the Year in 2013. For the ﬁ  rst time in the league’s history, a fresh-
man earned the honor.
In Jordan’s ﬁ  rst season 
with Florida, she played 1,897 
minutes, scored 22 goals and 
totaled 47 points.
The U-20 team is the reign-
ing World Cup winner and 
has already made a big splash in a game against France that ended with Jordan giving America a 1-0 win.
If the U-20 team makes it 
to the ﬁ  nals, Jordan won’t be back in time to start the sea-
son with Florida.
“We have a good mixture 
of leadership, talent and great 
technical ability on all three 
lines.” French said. “We have 
a lot of tactical understand-ing and creativity based on the way they read the game, and I see a lot of grit and bite in the way we defend. The combination of these factors gives us a very well-rounded 
team.”

big man Ben Wallace has prompted Young 
to credit those who have boosted him to na-
tional stage.
“Coach (Billy) Donovan did a good job 
of preparing me for what I’m going to be 
good at on this level,” Young said on the Pelicans’ site.
“The (New Orleans) coaches have reaf-
ﬁ  rmed that. Go out there, be a good team-
mate, rebound, be a vocal leader, play good 
defense, have a good work ethic every day, and come in with a smile on your face.”
The rookie is the ﬁ  rst of the three Florida 
players to be signed by a team (Scottie Wil-bekin, Casey Prather), and will now join a frontcourt heavy roster.
The 6-foot-9, 240-pound former Gator 
will join Anthony Davis, Omer Asik, Jeff Withey, Alexis Ajinca and Ryan Anderson 
down low on the Pelicans roster.
Because he will be forced to compete for 
playing time with 6-foot-10 to 7-foot cen-ters, Young will have to maintain the grind he displayed in Las Vegas.
But until then, he’s just happy he’ll be on 
an NBA roster.
“You don’t get this opportunity every 
day to play basketball for a living. So en-
joy it.”
“It’s just all about effort and your 
mindset. I just had the will that no one’s 
going to stop me from going after these 
loose balls.”YOUNG , from page 13“We have a good

Patric Young
Former UF centerMORGAN MORIARTY

AlligatorSports continues its position break-
down by looking at Florida’s offensive line.
The UF offensive line was marred with 
injuries in 2013, resulting in shifts along 
the line throughout the season and forced some players to play positions that weren’t naturally theirs.
However, with some veterans fully 
healthy, some talented junior college trans-fers and a new offensive line coach, the unit should be much improved for 2014.
New offensive line coach Mike Sum-
mers, who was hired from Southern Cali-fornia, takes over a group of players that have years of experience on the ﬁ  eld. 
Summers’ toughest project may be 
molding redshirt senior Max Garcia into a reliable center. With the departure of four-year starter Jonotthan Harrison, Garcia takes over at the position. The Norcross, Ga., native played left guard and left tackle 
in all 12 games for Florida last season. 
Garcia has never played center in his 
career, and he had some shaky snaps 
throughout the spring. 
Garcia — who was recently named to 
the Rimington Trophy watch list for the best center in college football — should get the kinks out by the time fall camp rolls around in the next three weeks.
Two linemen who come back this fall 
following season-ending injuries are Tyler Moore and Chaz Green. 
Green, who was positioned at right 
tackle, tore the labrum in his shoulder be-fore the 2013 season began, which forced Moore to move from left guard to right tackle in Green’s place.
With Green back fully healthy at right 
tackle, Moore can move back to his natu-ral position at left guard. Moore suffered a season-ending injury following a scooter accident late last season.
Junior D.J. Humphries will start at left 
tackle. He started in six of the seven games he played in as a sophomore before his knee injury in 2013. Now healthy, Humphries can play to his full potential this fall. Ex-
pectations remain high as Humphries was 
recently added to the 2014 Outland Trophy watch list, which is an honor awarded to the nation’s best interior lineman. He came 
in as the No. 1 tackle in the 2012 recruiting 
class, per Rivals.com.
Starting at right guard will be senior 
Trenton Brown, who played in all 12 games last season and started in Moore’s spot at 
right tackle in UF’s last ﬁ  ve games. Brown 
came to Gainesville last season as a JUCO transfer.
Given the experience that this unit has, 
the offensive line is capable of being very successful under Summers. Staying healthy will be critical to protect quarterback Jeff Driskel and execute the run game led by Florida’s deep running back corps.16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 22, 2014

� WILLIAMS FLIPPED TO UGA.
MORGAN MORIARTY
Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
Florida’s 2015 recruiting class 
lost a member of its verbal commit-
ments over the weekend. 
Deontai Williams (6-foot-1, 185 
pounds, Jacksonville, Fla., Trinity 
Christian Academy) decommitted 
from UF and verbally committed to Georgia on Saturday.
Williams’ ﬂ  ip to the Bulldogs 
came after his attendance at a Geor-gia football camp during the week-
end. Williams, a three-star safety, 
committed to Florida in January as the No. 35 safety in the 2015 class. 
UGA has the 10th ranked 2015 
class, with one ﬁ  ve-star commit, ﬁ  ve four-stars and nine three-stars.
With the de-
commitment, the 2015 UF class is left with just one defensive back — cornerback Marcus Lewis (6-foot-0, 194 pounds, Wash-
ington, D.C., 
Gonzaga College Academy). He 
has been wavering on his commit-ment in the last few weeks. If Lewis decommits, the coaching staff will have to completely reload with a new secondary.
Speciﬁ  cally at safety, Florida is 
set for at least the next two seasons. The Gators lose senior Jabari Gor-
man after the 2014 year, but they 
have Marcus Maye, Marcell Harris, Nick Washington and Keanu Neal behind him. Incoming freshmen J.C. Jackson and Quincy Wilson can play both corner and safety as well.
Payton decommits: Florida 
lost yet another commitment on Monday afternoon as wide re-
ceiver Tristan Payton (6-foot-0, 187 
pounds, Jacksonville, Fla., First Coast High) announced via Twit-ter that he would be decommitting from Florida. 
Payton, a three-star recruit, ver-bally committed to UF in January. Florida’s 2015 class is now the No. 35 overall class with a total of eight verbal commits, per Rivals.com. 
Recruiting news and notes: 
2015 offensive tackle George Brown (6-foot-5, 264 pounds, Cincinnati, Oh., Winton Woods High) visited UF on Monday. He is expected to make a verbal commitment on Friday. The four-star recruit holds offers  from Florida, Georgia, Ala-bama, Kentucky and LSU. 
UF’s only offensive lineman 
in the 2015 class is Tyler Jordan (6-foot-5, 270 pounds, Jacksonville, Fla., Bishop Kenny High) who com-mitted to UF in February.
Four-star outside linebacker Adonis Thomas (6-foot-3, 219 pounds, Lawrenceville, Ga., Cen-tral Gwinnett High) will choose between Alabama and Florida on 
Aug. 1, according to his Twitter ac-
count (@_SimplyThatGuy5). If the No. 16 ranked outside linebacker picks Florida, he would be the ﬁ  rst linebacker commitment for the 2015 class.
UF turns on the lights: Florida 
football’s marquee recruiting camp, otherwise known as “Friday Night 
Lights,” begins Friday evening in 
Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. 
This year will mark the 10th an-
nual session of the event, which fea-tures some of the top prospects in the 2015 class.
