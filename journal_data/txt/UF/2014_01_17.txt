The Plaza of the Americas may 
see renovations, including more seat-
ing areas and a designated area for 
Krishna Lunch.
The UF Foundation, the organi-zation spearheading the project, has 
amassed “serious donor interest” 
in the renovation, said Chandler 
Rozear, a project manager for the Ar-chitecture and Engineering Depart-ment at UF.
“(The Plaza) has gotten a little bit 
shabby and worn,” Rozear said. “It’ll be more formalized.” 
The Plaza is designated a green 
area on campus, which means con-
struction is prohibited, as stated on the admissions website.
Rozear said the renovation will 
only add benches and tables in the 
plaza, which is deemed acceptable by the university.
Alumni groups are open to seeing 
the plaza become a more welcoming 
place for students and student orga-
nizations to frequent, he said.

An updated version of the widely used TransLoc app 
might help Gainesville Regional Transit System bus riders 
get their mornings in gear a little faster.
The new app, TransLoc Rider, was released in response to the increasing amount of rider usage from 
2012 to 2013, said Scott Fox, director of UF’s 
Transportation and Parking Services.
“The new rider app is a very nice up-
grade,” he wrote in an email. “It is a far more interactive experience than simply 
looking at a map.”  
New features include a service that al-
lows users to locate the stops and routes 
nearest them via GPS, search for a desired route or stop with a new search component, and set alerts to notify users when their bus is five, 10 or 15 minutes away.
The upgrade is a welcome change for students who have 
used the older version of the TransLoc app. 
Morgan Emery, a 22-year-old UF computer science ju-
nior, said she uses the updated app to commute to campus from her apartment and appreciates the upgrade because it 
helps take some stress out of her morning routine.
“I have a couple extra minutes in the morning,” Emery 
said, “because it shows me exactly how much time I have.”Students jump onto new TransLoc Rider app bandwagon  HANNA MARCUS

Twenty states legally allow the use of medicinal mari-
juana, and Florida could be next in line after a statewide 
petition reached its 1 million signature goal. 
United for Care, the organization sponsoring the ini-
tiative in Florida, announced Wednesday night about 1.1 
million people had signed the petition, enough signatures 
to put medical marijuana legislation on the ballot. 
Morgan and Morgan law firm partner and United for 
Care Chairman John Morgan said the next step in the cam-paign is to verify that at least 675,000 signatures are valid, meaning that signers are registered to vote, live in Florida and only signed once. 
Morgan said they also must wait to hear the official 
ruling from the Supreme Court to ensure the language is 
constitutional. 
The organization hired Jon Mills, a constitutional schol-
ar and UF Levin College of Law professor, to look over the 
bill’s language.
“We hope that he’s done his job, and we think that he 
has,” Morgan said.
Some students who signed the petition, like Brandon 
Harvey, are excited to see the amount of signatures United for Care has received.
The 20-year-old UF neuroscience sophomore wrote in 
an email that he was impressed with the organization’s efforts in Gainesville and across the state.
If the signatures are all verified, Harvey said, he doesn’t 
“see any practical way we won’t have medical cannabis come November.”
Other students recognized that even though the orga-
nization had reached its goal, it doesn’t detract from the  controversial nature of the issue among residents.
Matt Pesek, vice chair for UF College Republicans, said 
that while he would be OK with the legislation appear-ing on the ballot, it is an issue that needs to be further researched.
“It’s a fairly divided topic,” Pesek said, a 21-year-old 
religion graduate student. “It’s an emerging field of re-High interest may

A quilt exhibit by a local artist has 
stitched its way into the art scene. 
Embroidered quilts by University 
Galleries Director Amy Vigilante can 
now be seen at The Thomas Center Gal-
leries until March 22. Locals can attend 
the opening reception for her exhibit, “A Bare Thread,” tonight from 6 to 7 p.m. at the gallery, 302 NE Sixth Ave.
The exhibit features 14 of Vigilante’s 
quilts, which were inﬂ  uenced by her background in painting and inspired by her personal experiences. She said she created her ﬁ  rst quilt — called “Zoey” 
— during storms caused by the four hur-
ricanes that came to Gainesville in 2004: Ivan, Charley, Frances and Jeanne.
“That fear made me want to cut up fabric,” Vigilante said.  
All of her quilts are named after dogs 
she knows and many of the materials used in her quilts are from cloth she has on hand, such as old Lucky Brand shorts or bathing suits.
The exhibit coincides with The Thom-
as Center’s 35th anniversary, which will showcase the art of regional artists in the gallery throughout the year, said Russell Etling, interim manager of cultural af-fairs for Gainesville’s Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Department.
“We try to broaden people’s perspec-
tives on what is art and celebrate the work being done here in our commu-
nity,” Etling said.
Chris Richards, a 29-year-old gradu-
ate art history student, said he admires 
Vigilante’s quilts because of their ability to document her past experiences.
“As a viewer, you can interact and 
understand those experiences through her quilts,” he said.Thomas Center exhibits

To keep online services from lagging be-
hind, UF is proceeding with plans to modern-
ize its current student record system.  
The 30-year-old homegrown technology, 
which includes the Integrated Student Infor-
mation System, is expected to be upgraded 
within the next three to four years.
Elias Eldayrie, UF Information Technol-
ogy vice president and chief information of-ﬁ  cer, said the upgrade is needed to meet the demands of mobile technology along with the growing population of students accessing UF services online.
“A lot of the functionality that students are 
used to today is much more modernized than what the system does today,” he said. “The mobile technology is not really as functional as we would like it to be for all parts of ISIS.”
Eldayrie and Zina Evans, associate provost 
and vice president for enrollment manage-ment, will be working on the estimated $40 million to $70 million upgrade of all student records.
One such update to ISIS is a waiting list for 
class registration, Eldayrie said.
“If you are trying to register for a class, 
and the class is closed, the new system allows you to go on a waiting list,” he said. “It’s ﬁ  rst come, ﬁ  rst serve, so when a seat opens up, then boom  — you’re in.”  
A six-month analysis of the current system 
revealed that it could address only 78 percent of the university’s needs.
“We think the new system will help us get 
closer to 95 percent of what the university’s needs are,” Eldayrie said.
He added that the new system, which will 
be implemented next January, will allow stu-dents to do more on their mobile devices.
UFIT communications manager Tracy Gale 
said the new system will better serve the UF online community.
“This way it will be in a comprehensive 
system, which is easier for staff to use and easier for people behind the scenes to main-tain,” she said. “Not only will it make things 
consolidated, but this also allows us to look at 
expanding services in the future.”UF to revamp ISIS, mobile tech

Calling all Trekkies, Whovians and Poke-
Masters of Florida: It’s that time of year 
again.
SwampCon, a free, two-day convention 
featuring a combination of anime, table-
top and video gaming and science fiction-
themed events, has come to UF’s Reitz 
Union for the third year in a row.Megan Jones, a 20-year-old UF account-
ing junior and main guest coordinator of the event, said it was “a place where people in-
terested in nerd culture can come hang out and have fun.”
A highlight of the event will include 
Whosical the Musical, a Doctor Who-themed 
musical. There’s also the Vocaloid Concert, 
a hologram concert featuring virtual pop stars, and the event’s very first drag show, 
which will feature local drag queens as well as some student performers, said Rachel 
Seaman, event coordinator and UF wildlife 
ecology and conservation senior, in an email 
interview.
SwampCon’s flagship event in 2012 had 
an attendance of about 2,000. It more than doubled last year with roughly 4,400 attend-ees, said Seaman.This year, about 4,000 guests are expected 
from throughout Florida. 
Some students will be coming to the 
event in costume, to celebrate the culture 
surrounding the convention.
Luci Behar, a 19-year-old UF nuclear en-
gineering sophomore, said she was dressing 
as Kaylee from “Firefly.” 
She said she likes seeing everyone else’s 
costumes and that she was planning on at-
tending with friends from out of town. 
“It’s close to home and it’s free,” Behar 
said. “It’s a good weekend to celebrate how nerdy everyone is.”Pull out the capes and neon wigs: Fans unite at SwampCon

When an electrical transformer blew 
Wednesday evening, some downtown 
businesses had to make the best of the situation. Customers just had to pause and be patient.
An underground fault triggered the 
transformer to explode at about 9:40 p.m. near the downtown Wells Fargo parking garage, leaving more than 1,900 Gainesville Regional Utilities customers without power, said Samantha Susock, a GRU corporate communications intern. 
About 1,500 customers regained pow-
er in less than a minute, and power was 
restored to the remaining 400 in a little 
less than an hour.  
Many restaurant and bar guests had 
to wait for the power to kick back on in order to resume normal business.
Some businesses were able to make 
light of the situation such as Dragonfly Sushi, located near the Hippodrome State Theatre. 
“We turned it around into a positive 
experience by lighting some candles and handing out some champagne,” said 
Dave Piasecki, the general manager of 
Dragonfly.   
Piasecki said that customers were un-
derstanding and knew the power outage was not the restaurant’s fault.
“We lost about 30 minutes worth of 
sales,” Piasecki said, adding that the res-taurant had to give away some free food. 
However, other restaurants were not 
as fortunate. Some had to operate credit card machines on battery power until they died, and customers grew impa-tient. 
Mel Crawford, owner of Sweet Mel’s 
on University Avenue, said the night started as a busy one. But after the out-age, she was forced to turn away custom-ers and send employees home early as a safety precaution. 
“It might not be much, but those ex-
tra to-go boxes and stuff like that costs us 
money,” she said. “It might only be pen-
nies, but it still cost us something.”Businesses cope with outageCRIME

Former Gators football player Jarvis 
Jaray Moss was arrested Monday night 
after police said he tried swallowing marijuana during a traffic stop.
Gainesville Police officers arrested 
the 29-year-old UF student on charges 
of tampering with evidence and mari-juana possession, according to an arrest report. 
At about 8:30 p.m., an officer stopped 
a car Moss was riding in for running a stop sign, according to the report. 
The officer noticed the smell of mari-
juana coming from the car and saw Moss 
chewing something. 
Moss told the officer he was eating 
food, but when he opened his mouth, 
the officer noticed large pieces of mari-
juana. 
During questioning, Moss told offi-
cers he smoked weed earlier but denied 
eating it, according to the report. 
Officers booked Moss into the Ala-
chua County Jail at about 9 p.m. He was released on his own recognizance Tues-
day afternoon.
Moss was originally recruited to 
Florida by Ron Zook, who coached the 
Gators from 2002 to 2004. However, it was under Urban Meyer that Moss ex-
celled.
In 2005, Moss led the 
Gators with 11 tackles 
for loss and 7.5 quarter-
back sacks.
During Florida’s 2006 
title run, Moss vaulted 
himself into stardom, famously blocking a 
last-second field goal by 
South Carolina to secure a 17-16 victory for the Gators.
After finishing the 2006 season with 
7.5 sacks, Moss was selected with the 17th pick in the 2007 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos.
In five NFL seasons, Moss played in 
53 games, recording 34 tackles and six sacks. He has not played in the NFL since his contract with the Oakland Raiders expired in 2011.Police: Jarvis Moss ate weed
Cars won’t be allowed to park on the plaza
which is considered an important element of the design project. 
The organization will have a designated 
area on the west side of the plaza where stu-dents can sit and eat.
Another change will be to prevent ve-
hicles from driving or parking on the plaza area.
But, Rozear said, the design will still wel-
come tailgaters. Carter Boydstun, senior philanthropic ad-
viser for the Foundation, said the plaza’s re-vitalization is dependent on donations from interested alumni.
The project has been planned for four 
years, going back and forth between admin-
istration officials and Foundation members.
“It’s a big deal and requires getting every-
one in the administration on board,” he said.
Final drafts of the plaza’s design will be 
taken to the Land Use and Facilities Planning 
Committee on Feb. 4, Rozear said.
“The design will make the plaza even 
more functional than it is now,” Boydstun said. “Right now it’s not set up to hold an 
event or function.”
However, a main obstacle the renova-
tion may face could be student displeasure 
with pedestrian traffic disruptions, said Jose 
Miranda, a 21-year-old UF political science 
and international studies senior.
Miranda, vice chair of the Reitz Union 
Board of Managers, was present when de-signs for the renovation were taking place.
“From my experience,” he said, “students 
mind a lot when construction or renovation of any kind happens to places they often fre-quent. There was a lot of displeasure when 
the Reitz construction began, and it took a lot 
of PR and marketing to promote it.”“(It’s) a place where people 
interested in nerd culture can come 
hang out and have fun.”

The club released a statement 
Thursday about the legislation. 
“First of all, the current proposal 
to allow medical marijuana in the state of Florida does not override the federal prohibition on the leafy substance, thus putting Floridians at risk of federal indictment regardless of state law,” it read. “Furthermore, and more importantly, the current 
bill is worded in such a way that 
doctors could prescribe marijuana for nearly any reason.” 
As for the next step in the cam-
paign, Morgan said that if enough signatures are verified and the Su-preme Court finds the language constitutional, United for Care will switch into full campaign mode.

A new store is opening in Gainesville for 
shoppers with expensive taste on a budget. 
The store, called Thrift 5 Boutique, is a 
higher-end branch of the Thrift 5 store on 
West University Avenue. Shoppers can at-tend its grand opening this evening at the new shop, located at 18B SW Second Ave. 
Angela Goodwin, manager of both stores, 
said the boutique will offer gently used cloth-ing, accessories and furniture at a reasonable price. 
“(The merchandise) is unique, but you will 
see that (the facility) is nicer,” Goodwin said, adding that the shop will also display work by local artists.Hailey Innocent, an 18-year-old UF inte-
rior design freshman, said she’s excited for 
the new store.
“Most people are on a budget, so if you 
can save a few bucks, that’s awesome,” she 
wrote.
Thrift 5 and Thrift 5 Boutique are nonprof-
it stores, donating all of the money earned to local charities such as the Ronald McDonald House, Alachua County Humane Society and Gainesville Pet Rescue.  
Jason Bowman, CEO of Pledge 5 Founda-
tion, which owns Thrift 5 and Thrift 5 Bou-tique, said the new boutique will help with the company’s proﬁ  t and outreach.
“We ﬁ  rst opened our doors just a few 
months ago in August, and so far, the ex-
penses outweigh the revenue,” he wrote in an 
email. “I think the opening of Thrift 5 Bou-tique will have a big impact.”Steal your grandpa’s style at

Gators can get psychedelic 
this weekend at a Woodstock-
inspired concert.
“The Summer of Love 
Concert” will be stopping at the Phillips Center for Performing Arts on Saturday to celebrate and share the music of the ‘60s with Gainesville residents and students.
Tickets for students are $10 
and are available on the UF Performing Arts website. Regular balcony tickets are $20.
The show begins at 7:30 p.m.The concert will recreate songs 
from popular classic rock bands including The Beatles, Santana, Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Doors and Janis Joplin.
Tony Pallagrosi, manager 
of UMT Presents Events and Concerts, said the concert will also feature Marc Rubinstein’s Pig Light Show.
The show is known as one of the most famous light shows in rock history for its use in the late 1960s.
“You’re going to feel the vibe,” 
said Pallagrosi. “You’re going to feel the spirit of the period.”Carolina De La Rosa, a 19-year-
old UF health science sophomore, said she is looking forward to 
the twists that “The Summer of 
Love Concert” will put into the classics.  
“The ‘60s was a time of change 
and exploring new things,” De 
La Rosa said. “With that sort of 
mentality, I think people can reminisce and enjoy something they love, even if it is a little 
different.”

The weather continued its ﬁ  ckle behavior into this sec-
ond half of January. It’s hot and humid, it’s cold and dry 
— it’s suddenly cold and wet? And now it’s back to windy 
and cold. At this point, we’re ready to trade chapped 
hands and runny noses back for our normal sweaty brows 
and sunburned shoulders. And Gainesville, what’s up with student houses that don’t have central heating?! It’s hard enough to get out of bed at the crack of dawn for classes, but in this weather? Forget about it; there’s only so much 
a warm laptop can do. At least the weekend — all three 
days of it — is upon us, and we’re free to sleep the days away from within the comfort and warmth of our respec-tive blanket caves. 
At least one thing is constant week to week: your week-
ly roundup of the best and the worst of the news. Here it is, this week’s 
Darts and Laurels 
While the rest of the country is gradually warming back 
up in the wake of the sudden cold snap, local farmers’ crops sustained serious damage. 
We reported Thursday that North Florida farmers suf-
fered after plants froze and fungi infections spread, which is bad news in the long run for both the hard-working farm-ers and ourselves. The decrease in harvest will drive local 
farm workers’ proﬁ  ts down and the prices of the foods we 
love up. Thanks a heap, Mother Nature. 
For that, we throw an ice-cold DART to the polar vortex  
and its destruction of all that’s good and holy: fruits and veggies. 
You may have noticed an old friend on campus this 
week: The free copies of The New York Times. UF Student Body President Christina Bonarrigo reinstated the newspa-per program after its suspension over the summer due to 
an outstanding debt of about $30,000. 
We’re handing off a cautionary, don’t-mess-this-up-
again LAUREL to Bonarrigo for bringing back our beloved 
newspapers. 
We also reported this week that, come Summer B, stu-
dent fees will rise about $2 per credit hour. Although the 
increase may seem small, that’s $2 less you have to spend on worthier investments — like a slice at Leo’s or a tankard at The Midnight on Tuesdays. This is on top of the fact that 
Bright Futures doesn’t cover summer semesters. 
This week, we toss a mo-money-mo-problems DART at 
the UF fees committee. 
Finally, an I-love-you-and-please-don’t-ever-change 
LAUREL to Martin Luther King Jr.,  civil rights and state-
sanctioned holidays. 
Consider doing something productive with those extra 
24 hours — or, you know, go hard on your Sunday Funday. 
Anything is fair game.Taylor Swift resurrects concert business
If you broke my life down into a series of fun facts, one of the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve would have something to do with loving the music and the persona of Taylor Swift. I 
think she’s really great.  
And, not to brag, but my adoration runs deep: I don’t 
just listen to the hits and call it a day. I get down and dirty 
in the Deep Cuts. Some might say that I liked her before 
she was cool. 
So you can imagine my lack of surprise when I heard 
that her most recent North American tour, aka the Red 
Tour, basically saved the concert industry from certain doom.  
I had the privilege of seeing one of those shows when 
she came down to Florida last spring. 
My expectations were high, and as soon as Ed Sheer-
an ﬁ  nished his opening act, they were met and then out-done. 
There was a doo-wop version of “You Belong With 
Me,” ridiculously detailed stage decorations, a plat-form she used to hover above the crowd while she sang “Sparks Fly,” and about 37 costume changes. 
It was quite literally perfect. 
The money I paid to see her in person ended up be-
ing roughly $70 out of the $110 million in ticket sales the 
Red Tour generated. 
And now, ﬁ  nally, it appears as though concerts are 
proﬁ  table again: The industry had its own little mini-re-cession when the actual recession and overpriced Jonas Brothers tickets burst its bubble back in 2010.  
By touring hot on the heels of a wildly successful 
album and setting ticket prices fairly low, Swift pretty much single-handedly stopped the concert industry from decaying further. 
This is a pretty big deal, not just for the concert in-
dustry but for music as a whole.  
When Beyoncé Knowles released “Beyoncé” late last 
year, it sold about a million copies.  But it was also illegally 
downloaded a quarter of a million times, meaning what 
would have been $3.8 million 
became $0.  
And in 2013 alone, her entire 
catalog was downloaded 2 mil-
lion times for free. 
I’m not going to sit here and 
judge people because they got music for free. That’s the 
record companies’ problem.  
The Internet requires that they change the way they 
do business. 
They won’t be able to actually sell records for much 
longer.  
For every sucker who pays good, old-fashioned 
American dollars to download an album, there’s some-one else who did the exact same thing for free.  
The exact same process, the exact same result — but 
one of them also just bought lunch for a Columbia ex-ecutive. Soon that person is going to wise up and get 
their music for free, too.
This is why the revival of the concert is so important. 
It’s, like, the only thing the music industry could reli-
ably make money on anymore. It’s a lot harder to sneak 
into a concert without paying for it than it is to get mu-
sic from the Internet — not impossible, but a lot harder.  That, and people are willing to pay to see their favorite artists in person, even if they won’t pay to listen to that artist’s recordings. 
Now that Taylor Swift showed the world that tours 
can be proﬁ  table again, we’ll see more and more of them.  
So if you enjoy the existence of a music industry, 
thank a Taylor Swift fan. You owe them.

Inaccurate reporting in Tuesday’s 
Alligator
In Tuesday’s article on the availability 
of The New York Times on campus, the 
Alligator made some serious errors in re-
porting.
The article focuses on Student Body 
President Christina Bonarrigo’s efforts to 
reinstate the program, but it fails to men-
tion that the program was initially can-
celed under Bonarrigo’s purview in May 2013, not May 2012 as stated in the article. 
The real story here is not that Bonarrigo 
“made the free New York Times program 
reappear on campus,” but that it took her over six months to bring back the service 
that ended because of her carelessness.
To review the facts, SG had a contract 
with USA Today and the New York Times to have 460 copies of each paper available daily for students on campus. 
Under the budget that Bonarrigo over-
saw as chairwoman of the senate budget 
committee, the readership program was 
assigned $40,000 for the 2012-2013 school year, even though the full cost was over $66,000. 
When Student Government neglected 
to pay the remainder, the newspaper com-panies were forced to void the contract. By this time, Bonarrigo had been elected stu-dent body president. 
According to reporting from the Alli-
gator in May 2013, representatives of the newspapers had difficulty reaching mem-bers of UF SG, and only heard from Bonar-rigo after the Alligator contacted her for comment.
From my personal experience serving 
as a student senator, Bonarrigo and other members of the Swamp Party-dominated SG dragged their feet and refused to take 
action to reinstate the beloved program. 
Instead of trying to find a permanent, sus-tainable solution for providing students with access to The New York Times, or any nationally recognized newspaper, the budget committee chose to cut future 
funding for the program entirely, while 
other budgets received only 5 percent cuts, or none at all.
While Bonarrigo’s failure to serve the 
students is not news to me, the true disap-
pointment was the Alligator’s lack of jour-
nalistic standards. Perhaps the Alligator should have referred to differing views — or even their own reporting — before they 
published such a pathetic puff piece.

More study space in Marston 
coming soon
President Bernie Machen re-
cently unveiled a plan to create 
more student study space on the 
first floor of Marston Science Li-
brary.  
I could not be more support-
ive of this decision. According to the Student Experience in the Re-search University survey, UF stu-dents identify more study space 
as the biggest need at UF.
The plan to add study space 
for nearly 700 students is a much-
needed improvement. 
Student Government recog-
nizes the need for more study space, and we are working to cre-ate even more study locations on campus.
One of my biggest priorities 
this semester is to secure fund-ing to transform Newell Hall into a study space equipped with the latest technology and infrastruc-
ture to support the needs of stu-dents in the 21st century. Newell 
Hall, when combined with the new plans for Marston, will in-
crease student study space by 40 
percent.
I will be working with External 
Affairs Chairwoman Abby Whid-don to lobby the state legislature 
in the upcoming session, but we are going to need some help. We 
will need the entire Student Body to help us show the elected offi-
cials in Tallahassee that renovat-
ing Newell Hall is a project worth investing in.
Go Gators!
Christina Bonarrigo
UF Student Body President
It’s 7 a.m. on a Sunday, and you feel like your heart is go-ing to burst. 
Maybe you had a little too much 
to drink last night. 
Maybe you woke up abruptly from a night-
mare.
Or maybe you’ve just hit mile 10 on the el-
liptical. 
Let’s be real, you don’t always run 10 
miles, but when you do, it’s because you alone ate 80 percent of the pizza you ordered Saturday in a failed attempt to get your roommates to listen to you complain about 
your not-so-significant other. 
But hey, this morning you got your ass out 
of bed and worked up to that 138-beats-per-
minute heart rate. 
OK, maybe that’s just us neurotic folk, but 
regardless of how you deal with breakups, they’ll always be a thing. 
In the words of the song Tupac sampled in 
“Changes,”  that’s just the way it is.
An infographic published last week in 
Know More, a Washington Post Wonkblog, illustrates breakup statistics. 
The information presented is digestible 
and relatable to pretty much anyone who’s ever been involved with anyone else. 
Through research compiled from the U.S. 
Census, various social media outlets and a Durex global sex survey, the data in the chart 
explores trends in fizzled relationships.
And while an internal dialogue and over-
speculation of what went wrong may seem 
like the way to figure out what to do differ-
ently in your next dating adventure, maybe 
all you have to do to keep moving forward is revel in the fact that it’s not Monday and it’s a long way to December. 
(The day of the year you’re most likely to 
be broken up with is the first Monday in De-cember, according to the stats.)
Instead of focusing on the negatives and 
what day it isn’t, remember that attitude 
is everything — I know it’s cheesy, but it’s 
true. 
Whether you were the dumper or the 
dumpee, breakups aren’t pleasant. 
So let’s try to look at this infographic through the eyes of Mr. Rogers or, you know, whomever you consider a positive role model.
Maybe you were just bro-
ken up with, but according to 
the graphic, if you were born after 1984, it’s highly likely you were dumped in person or 
over the phone. 
At least you were acknowledged, and 
even though conversations that break things 
off can be tough, you’ll get through it. 
As Mr. Rogers once said, “Often when you 
think you’re at the end of something, you’re at the beginning of something else.”
I realize I sound a little preachy quoting 
Mr. Rogers. 
So here are a few words for those of you 
whose role models are a bit rougher around the edges: “Post break-up sex that helps you forget your ex.” 
Maybe like The Vaccines you, too, can find 
comfort in engaging in no-strings-attached coitus. 
According to the Know More infographic, 
47 percent of men and 40 percent of women 
worldwide have had a one-night stand. 
I’m not saying they’re for everyone, but if 
you’re into that kind of thing, remember: It’s 
Friday, and you live in a pretty big college town. 
OK, so what if you’re not into role mod-
els, and none of this is helping to lift your spirits? 
Just think, someone somewhere is on a 
first date right now. 
Every day, 3 million people in the world 
go on first dates. 
If you keep up those 10-miles-on-the-el-
liptical Sundays, one of those people could 
be you. 
Because exercising exudes endorphins, 
maybe soon you’ll feel up to jumping back 
into the dating game. 
You might find someone with whom to 
share that box of pizza. 
Someone who thinks they like you/who’s 
pretty sure they do/who would go to Thai with you/if you asked them to.

opinions@alligator.orgWe are told the right to have 
an abortion was given to us by female-friendly poli-
ticians and a liberal Supreme Court, 
but that’s just not true. 
Abortion was won by women like 
you and me — speaking out, orga-
nizing, marching in the streets — the Supreme Court and legislators fol-lowed our lead.
In 1969, four years before the 
1973 Supreme Court decision Roe 
v. Wade, women in Redstockings of 
the Women’s Liberation Movement appeared at a New York City legisla-tive hearing on abortion law reform, 
where several women tried to take 
the microphone from the scheduled 
speakers:  14 men and a nun.  Barred from testifying, Redstockings shout-ed out its demands:  that women testify as the real experts on abortion and for repeal of all abortion laws.  
Redstockings held its own abor-
tion “Speakout” soon afterward at the Washington Square Methodist Church in New York, where mem-bers testified about their own — then criminal — abortions before an au-dience of more than 300 people and the media. In 1970, New York State passed the most liberal abortion law in the country, legalizing abortion through the second trimester in most cases. 
When the Supreme Court ruled 
three years later in Roe v. Wade, it used the New York State law as its model.
Women’s control over their bod-
ies has been an ongoing fight. In its 
1989 Webster decision, the Supreme 
Court ruled that states could restrict 
abortion. Then-Florida-Gov. Bob Martinez called a special session to make Florida the first state to restrict 
abortion following the Webster deci-
sion. Florida feminists, including 
Gainesville Women’s Liberation, 
called for a march on the capitol. Ten thousand women showed up on the 
Monday of the special session, and 
no legislation was passed.
The aggressiveness of the anti-
choice movement has gained consid-erable momentum in the past three years, erupting last summer with the passage of anti-choice legislation in 
more than a dozen states, including 
Ohio, Texas and North Carolina.  
These measures included legisla-
tion severely restricting and, in some 
cases, banning abortion 20 weeks 
post-conception and imposing ex-
pensive and unnecessary regulations 
that force abortion clinics to close, as happened in Texas.  More than 20 other states, including Florida, will have similar legislation pending this year.  
Just like when women won the 
right to abortion in this country through a movement, we need a movement now to fight back against these attacks and win more rights for women. National Women’s Libera-tion is a feminist group fighting for free and full access to all forms of birth control, including contracep-tion and abortion.  
We believe women should con-
trol when and if we have children. To get involved, come to our next local meeting Jan. 29 at 7 p.m. at Lit-tle Hall, Room 119, or contact us at nwl@womensliberation.org or (352) 575-0495. Our website is womenslib-eration.org.

Residents of Gainesville have 
an opportunity to have their stories 
archived in the Library of Congress or to potentially be featured on Na-tional Public Radio.
StoryCorps is partnering with 
WUFT-FM to record and shar-ing the stories of the people of Gainesville from Feb. 6 to March 7 as a part of its countrywide Mobile-Booth tour. 
“We feel that everyone has a story to share and that everyone’s story matters,” said Jesse Gutierrez, 
an outreach coordinator at Story-
Corps.
StoryCorps interviews are usu-
ally conducted between two friends 
or family members and are guided by a StoryCorps facilitator during a 40-minute recording session, said Gutierrez.
The interview sessions are free 
with a $25 suggested donation. 
At the end of the sessions, par-
ticipants are given a complimen-
tary CD copy of their session and 
can choose to have their stories ar-chived at the Library of Congress.
Sue Wagner, WUFT-FM’s direc-
tor of community relations, said 
the most interesting stories will be 
aired as part of WUFT-FM’s Morn-ing Edition show on Fridays at 6:28 and 8:28 a.m.“It’s basically an opportunity for 
us to give back to the community, 
to reach the community and allow 
them to share their stories,” Wag-ner said.
Wagner said people have al-
ready begun calling WUFT-FM 
asking when they can make an appointment with the StoryCorps 
MobileBooth. When the program 
came to Gainesville in 2008, ap-
pointments were completely ﬁ  lled within the ﬁ  rst 30 minutes.
“Anyone can come to our booth. There’s no one speciﬁ  c that we’re looking for,” Gutierrez said. “We 
want the full ﬂ  avor of Gainesville.”
The MobileBooth will be sta-
tioned at the Alachua County Li-brary District Headquarters at 401 
E. University Ave.
“It’s a good opportunity for 
people to document their lives and 
also their loved ones’ lives,”  said 
Gutierrez. “How many chances do 
we get to have something like a re-cording of our grandparent in our back pocket?”StoryCorps to give local residents voice with recorded interviews

Gainesville Police arrested a lo-
cal man and his girlfriend Wednes-
day night after police said he used an axe handle to choke a man and then beat him with a cellphone.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested Ricky Bryant 
Grifﬁ  s, 46, and his girlfriend, San-dra Coxie Poston, 51, on battery and resisting ofﬁ  cer charges, ac-cording to an arrest report.
At about 7:20 p.m., Grifﬁ  s start-
ed arguing with a man about drugs and alcohol, according to the re-port. The argument escalated until 
Grifﬁ  s put an axe around the man’s 
neck and pulled back, choking him. He also used the axe’s blade to cut the man on the neck.
The victim freed himself from 
Grifﬁ  s and tried to call police, ac-cording to the report. When Grifﬁ  s noticed he was on the phone, he snatched it out of the man’s hand 
and pushed him on the ground. 
He then got on top of the man and started hitting him with the cell-phone, according to the report.
When ofﬁ  cers arrived, Poston 
began yelling and cursing at the ofﬁ  cers. During the investigation, ofﬁ  cers repeatedly told Poston to step back but she refused, accord-
ing to the report. An ofﬁ  cer pushed 
Poston away, and she slapped the ofﬁ  cer’s hands away.
As ofﬁ  cers handcuffed Poston, 
Grifﬁ  s tried to break free, accord-ing to the report. During question-ing, he told police he hit the man with the phone but denied choking him with the axe, according to the 
report. 
Ofﬁ  cers booked Grifﬁ  s and Pos-
ton into the jail at about 8:30 p.m., 
where they remained as of press time in lieu of $15,000 and $10,000 bonds, respectively.Arrest after axe choking“We want the full ﬂ  avor of

All play and no rest made Will Yeguete a 
tired man.
From No. 7 Florida’s first game of 2014 
against Richmond to Saturday’s contest 
against Arkansas, Yeguete and the Gators didn’t have a single day off as they had a full week of either practices or games.
“I thought he looked really exhausted,’’ 
coach Billy Donovan said on Yeguete’s per-formance against the Razorbacks. “He didn’t have any bounce, any legs.”
To get the senior forward back at full 
strength before Tuesday’s game against Geor-gia, Donovan decided to sit him out of Sun-day’s practice and give him only half of his normal reps during Monday’s practice.
“I think that probably helped him physi-
cally some trying to get rejuvenated,” Dono-van said.
From the 
opening tipoff of 
Tuesday night’s 
matchup, Yeguete 
showed more energy than he had all year. In the first 4:15 against the Bulldogs, the 6-foot-8 
forward had already corralled two rebounds 
and scored the Gators’ first field goal. 
In 28 minutes against Arkansas, Yeguete 
sunk only one of his three attempted shots.
“He was taking good shots, playing great 
defense, not doing anything he can’t do, tak-ing care of the ball, just effecting the game and running the floor,’’ fellow senior Patric Young 
said. “Playing his style of play. He was really 
focused and locked in on that.”
Yeguete finished Tuesday’s game 5-of-6 
shooting and 2 of 2 from the free-throw line 
for 12 points and six rebounds  — his highest 
total since he grabbed seven boards against Richmond to kick off 2014.The last time Yeguete had an offensive 
night like he did Tuesday was against Mis-souri on Jan. 19, 2013, when he went 6-of-7 shooting for 13 points. That was the last time he made at least five field goals and scored at 
least 12 points in a contest.
With Michael Frazier II stealing the show 
with a career-high 21 points and Patric Young coming in for a close second with 10 points and nine rebounds, Yeguete was the unsung 
hero against Georgia, according to Dorian 
William A. England / Alligator Staff
Will Yeguete warms up before Florida’s 67-61 win against Kansas on Dec. 10, 2013, in the O’Connell Center. Yeguete has 
started all 16 of the Gators’ game this season, averaging 24.3 minutes and 4.9 rebounds per game. After a strong perfor-mance against Georgia on Tuesday, Yeguete and Florida will take on Auburn in Auburn, Ala., on Saturday.

Florida has not lost to Auburn in a 
decade — an impressive reign that will 
be tested tonight at 8 in UF’s Southeast-
ern Conference opener in Auburn, Ala.   
“I just really want our team to go out 
there and continue to improve, espe-
cially on the mistakes that we made last 
week,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
She added that she was unaware it 
had been so long since UF last lost to 
Auburn.
Florida fell from No. 1 to a tie for 
No. 4 after barely escaping UCLA with a victory. But the Gators were not the only team to take a tumble. Auburn fell from No. 13 to No. 18 after defeat-ing unranked Texas Woman’s 194.875-
189.825.
But the win did not come without 
consequences.
Senior Mackenzie Caquatto’s place 
in the lineup is also in question after 
posting a career low of 8.40 on floor against the Bruins. This was the first time Caquatto scored below a 9.00 in nearly four years at UF.

Throughout Cory McGee’s career at 
UF, she has been a triple-threat. 
While running through unleveled 
cross-country terrains, circling an in-
door track and competing as a member of Team USA, McGee has become an elite runner.
As a senior, she is hoping to use all of 
these experiences to have her most suc-cessful season yet.
“I think I’m an aggressive athlete and 
an aggressive racer,” McGee said. “So I think that no 
matter what field I’m 
put in, I’m going to do 
everything I can to win the race.”
The 21-year-old dis-
tance runner from Pass 
Christian, Miss., had the 
opportunity to compete 
for Team USA in Moscow in the summer 
of 2013.
McGee was ecstatic to represent her 
country last summer at the IAAF World Senior continuing success 
during track and field season

Yeguete receives much-deserved rest after tiring stretchGORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
After a full week off, Florida is poised 
to return to action against Georgia on Sun-
day at 1 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. 
The Gators dropped their last contest to 
then-No. 12 LSU 82-68 on Sunday in Baton Rouge, La. 
With an extended break, Florida should be well prepared for Georgia’s arrival.
“Bye weeks are critical,” coach Amanda 
Butler said. 
“You’ve got to make sure that you get 
your rest in. You’ve got to make sure that 
you take advantage of maybe putting in 
a few extra things or tightening up some things. The ﬁ  rst part of this week is to work on us.”
Historically, the Bulldogs have domi-
nated the Gators. In the 62 games played against one another, Georgia leads the se-ries 48-14. 
But if this year’s statistics mean any-
thing, Florida should have the upper hand this time around. 
The Gators are 9-1 at home this season 
and are 3-1 in Southeastern Conference play, and the Bulldogs are 3-3 away from 
Athens, Ga., and 1-4 against conference 
opponents so far this season.
However, both teams appear to be 
meeting at watershed moments Sunday.
Georgia is coming off a narrow victory 
against Arkansas on Thursday, while Flor-ida is looking to get back to its winning ways after dropping its ﬁ  rst contest in 10 games last week against LSU. 
The key to Sunday’s matchup, and most 
SEC games, will be in the paint.
“In every SEC matchup, you have to 
look at what’s going to happen in the paint 
and make sure you’re putting yourself in 
the best situation possible for that battle,” Butler said. “That’s probably where we’ll start.”
Winning in the paint will be a tall order 
for the Gators. Florida is down to seven active players while Georgia’s bench is 12 players deep and littered with 6-footers.
“They’ve got good size,” Butler said. 
“They’ve got some really dynamic play-ers. We’re going to have to play a really complete ball game coming off the heels of a loss on Sunday, a much better game in the paint.”
Aside from last week’s loss to LSU, Flor-
ida has been strong throughout conference play with wins coming against Mississippi State, Arkansas and, most impressively, 
No. 10 Kentucky in Lexington, Ky. 
Although the Gators have played well, 
they are not satisﬁ  ed with where they 
stand.“One of the things I like the most about 
where we are is that we are 3-1 and our kids are disappointed about that,” Butler said. 
“There was no, ‘Valiant effort. Let’s pat 
ourselves on the back because we were one woman down.’ “They were disappointed. They knew 
they hadn’t played well and weren’t look-ing for any excuses in that loss. I think we’ve got great indications, so far, in the way that we’ve played and how we have 
to play to be a very good team and beat 
very good teams.”

Prather questionable: Casey 
Prather (bone bruise in right knee) is 
closer to returning to the Gators.
The senior forward participated in 
non-contact work during Thursday’s 
practice and is listed as questionable 
for No. 7 Florida’s matchup at Au-burn on Saturday at 4 p.m., the school 
announced Thursday. 
He sat out the full-scrimmage ses-
sions of practice Thursday and even-
tually went to the training room to receive more treatment.
Prather has missed UF’s past two 
games since waking up with swelling in his right knee the morning of Jan. 9. In 14 contests this year — all starts — Prather has averaged a team- and 
career-best 17 points on 62.4 shoot-
ing, along with 5.5 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game.night and apologized to Faehn immediately after Saturday’s 
meet.
“She texted me right away 
after the meet that night and 
said ‘I’m really sorry; won’t happen again,’” Faehn said. 
“And I’m like, ‘Listen, you’re 
human. We’re going to get there. Don’t worry.”
Faehn said Tuesday she 
would like to see Caquatto compete as an all-arounder at Auburn, but Faehn had not made a final decision because she had not had a chance to 
evaluate Caquatto since the 
team returned from California.
“I know she wants to,” 
Faehn said of Caquatto com-
peting tonight.
Auburn may not get to see 
Caquatto compete all-around, 
but the Tigers will be the sec-ond team ever to get a look at 
sophomore Morgan Frazier. 
Faehn plans to have Frazier ex-hibition a vault routine against the Tigers. 
After enrolling at UF late 
in Spring 2013, Frazier never once competed with the Gators but did exhibition her vault routine in a Jan. 8, 2013, meet 
against Missouri.
Kytra Hunter, who was 
honored as SEC Co-Gymnast 
of the Week after winning all-around with a score of 39.375 against UCLA, will likely lead Florida’s all-around effort against Auburn. 
Beyond a few individual let 
downs at UCLA, Faehn is also looking to improve her squad’s energy on the road. 
“To compete aggressively 
again on the road, we have to really create the energy our-selves and I think that we were a little lacking in some of that energy,” Faehn said. 
“We really need to be a little 
bit louder in that sense.”
It’s been five years since the 
Gators opened their season on the road and 11 years since they began a season with to back-
to-back road meets. Faehn said 
she’s eager to debut her 2014 squad in the O’Connell Center on Jan. 24 against Georgia. 
“Oh, I can’t wait to be back 
into the O’Dome,” Faehn said. 
“We’re so used to starting 
here, in the O’Dome … and to have two on the road in the be-ginning it’s fine. 
“It’s how the schedule is, 
but I’m looking forward to get-ting back here.” FRIDAY, JANUARY  17, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Kytra Hunter performs a floor routine during the NCAA Regionals on April 6, 2013, in 
the O’Connell Center. Hunter was named the Southeastern Conference Co-Gymnast of the Week after winning all-around against UCLA with a score of 39.375.
McGee gained experience competing at 
IAAF World Championships in Moscow
Championships.
“Donning the red, white and blue and getting to 
know those people was so incredible,” she said. 
“I totally immersed myself in the experience and 
just spend every minute getting to know the team.”
McGee said there were eight men chosen from 
UF, but she was the lone woman chosen for the na-
tional team. She said it felt like her and the men had 
the same talent and capabilities. 
With the combination of running cross country 
in the fall and track and field in the spring, she has complied plenty of credibility and accolades for her 
collegiate career. 
Her career bests include a 4:32.10 mile run dur-
ing the 2013 indoor season, and a 2:05.39 800-meter run in the outdoor season of 2012.
As a testament to her success, she was named to 
the Bowerman Trophy women’s preseason watch-
list before the 2014 indoor season, a first-time ap-
pearance. 
The Bowerman is regarded as the Heisman Tro-
phy of collegiate track and field, and it is awarded 
to the top male and female athlete in NCAA track and field. 
McGee would be the first Florida athlete to win 
the award, which has been given out every year since 2009.
“I know a few of them and to kind of feel like I’m 
compared in the same class is definitely exciting,” McGee said. “To look back on people who’ve won this award 
in the past is a humbling experience. 
“I love track so much, so if I could potentially 
win the Bowerman award, that would just be the most fulfilling achievement up to date.” 
McGee lived up to the hype at the Gators’ first 
meet of the season. 
The senior runner finished first in the women’s 
800-meter at the UAB Blazer Invitational on Jan. 11, setting a meet record with a time of 2:07.47. 
McGee’s win was one of 13 Florida event victo-
ries at the meet.
Paul Spangler, the assistant cross country and 
distance coach, who has trained his star athlete while at UF, said she has done extremely well.
Spangler said she is a competitor that is not in-
timidated by other runners and wants to compete 
against the best in the world. 
What seems like a minimum amount of events 
left for McGee to compete for is far from what lies 
after her collegiate career. 
“It’s another stepping stone towards what I hope 
to do in the future,” McGee said. “I hope to continue my track and field career.”TrAck , from page 13

Gators coaches are hitting the 
road to ﬁ  nish off the 2014 class 
strong with fewer than three weeks until National Signing Day.
Florida currently has 21 com-
mits along with nine early enroll-ees, but there is still a lot of work to be done. 
Thursday at midnight marked 
the end of the recruiting “dead 
period,” which prohibits coaches 
from having in-person contact with recruits. However, phone conversations were allowed.
UF’s coaching staff was across 
the country Thursday visiting top prospects. 
One was 2014 three-star offen-
sive tackle Andrew Mike. 
Mike is the No. 14 tackle in the 
state of Arizona, according to Ri-vals.com. 
UF already has ﬁ  ve offensive 
linemen in its current class, but the Gators need all the help they can get as they return just ﬁ  ve offen-sive linemen with starting experi-ence in 2014. 
Florida defen-
sive coordinator D.J. Durkin, wide receivers coach Joker Phillips 
and defensive 
line coach Brad 
Lawing also vis-ited four-star de-
fensive end Lorenzo Carter out of 
Norcross, Ga., Thursday morning, 
according to ESPN.
Carter will visit LSU this week-
end, Florida State the following 
weekend and Georgia on the last weekend before signing day. 
New UGA defensive coordina-
tor Jeremy Pruitt, who held the same position at FSU last season, was hired Tuesday. Pruitt is an 
outstanding recruiter who could 
beneﬁ  t from being familiar with 
Carter while he tried to recruit him to FSU. Carter visited UF in Sep-tember. 
Florida’s 2014 class is in dire 
need of an explosive playmaker at 
receiver. Kentucky commit Garrett 
Johnson could ﬁ  ll that void. 
Johnson is a three-star receiver 
out of Orlando West Orange High. 
He has shown impressive elusive-
ness speed and good hands on 
ﬁ  lm. 
A member of UF’s coaching 
staff is expected to visit Johnson on 
Sunday, ESPN reported.
2014 dual-threat quarterback 
Deiondre Porter decommitted from USF on Thursday afternoon, per ESPN. He is scheduled to make an ofﬁ  cial visit to UF this weekend. 
Porter would add depth to Flor-
ida’s quarterback corps, which has just Jeff Driskel and Skyler Morn-hinweg returning with starting ex-perience.
Five-star athlete Adoree’ Jack-
son and offensive tackle Damian Prince are a couple of top prospects to keep an eye on in the coming weeks. Will Muschamp, defensive backs coach Travaris Robinson and new offensive coordinator 
Kurt Roper visited Jackson on Thursday. Prince is scheduled to 
make an ofﬁ  cial visit to Gainesville on Jan. 31, but UF running backs coach Brian White also visited him

TOP-10 SQUADS TONIGHT AT 8:30.

Four top-10 teams will face off tonight at 
the two-day Southern Methodist University 
Invitational. 
The No. 3 Florida men’s swimming and 
diving team will be one of those top squads 
traveling to Dallas to take on No. 1 Michi-
gan, No. 6 USC, No. 8 Louisville, Purdue and SMU at 8:30 p.m.
Only eight swimmers and a diver will suit up for the Gators over the weekend in a specially formatted meet. 
“It gives us the chance to see athletes in 
a much more controlled setting a little bit similar to the championship meet at the end of the year,” coach Gregg Troy said.
Because swimmers competing in three 
events have to make one event a relay, Troy said he had to select swimmers who could contribute in those races. 
Redshirt senior Sebastien Rousseau, se-
niors Connor Signorin, Brad deBorde and 
Marcin Cieslak, juniors Matt Elliott, Dan 
Wallace and Eduardo Solaeche-Gomez, sophomore Corey Main and redshirt sopho-more diver Zach Hernandez will be making the journey to Dallas.
The Gators have put swimmers in events 
that are not always their strong suits this 
season in an attempt to diversify an already 
deep roster and ﬁ  nd swimmers’ third event 
for the upcom-ing championship meets in February and March.
But the SMU Invite will have them in 
more familiar swims.
“The men, in Dallas, will swim events 
that they’re a little bit better at,” Troy said. 
“Now there’s a couple guys, a guy like 
Rousseau, that since it’s only two days we may not swim exactly the same events as what we would swim at the end of the year. But we’re certainly looking at events that we’re considering real strongly.”
Florida will be using this meet to mea-
sure its team against quality opponents. And with only a month to go until Southeastern Conference Championships, Troy said he will be using this meet to make some of his ﬁ  nal lineup adjustments to the roster.
However, Troy is pleased with the over-
all attitude and progress the team has made since returning from a six-week break from 
competition to defeat FSU on Jan. 4.
“We’re in a pretty good spot,” Troy said. 
“The weaknesses we’ve addressed we 
feel like we’ve gotten better on.” Florida takes on other top-ranked teams at SMU Invite
