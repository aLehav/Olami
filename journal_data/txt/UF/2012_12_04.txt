Alumni and supporters have 
taken to the Internet to express their 
discontent with the University Ath-letic Association’s recent decision to ground UF cheerleaders.
A “Save Florida Cheerleading” 
Facebook page has garnered nearly 1,000 likes since its creation Nov. 28, as of press time. 
Other cheerleading squads, like 
one at Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, posted pictures with signs that support reversing the UAA’s ban on tumbling and stunting at events, games and practices.
The Facebook page coincides with 
a “Save Florida Cheerleading” web-site. Both sites ask The Gator Nation to contact UF athletic director Jer-emy Foley and assistant athletic di-rector Martin Salamone asking them to let the cheerleaders ﬂ  y.
Jason Merslich, a former UF 
cheerleader and one of the Facebook page creators, said he hopes the pag-es will bring awareness to boosters and alumni.
The dangers associated with acro-
batic stunts are not worth the risk for the cheerleaders or UF, senior associ-ate athletics director Steve McClain wrote in an emailed statement.
“Instead of waiting for a tragedy 
to occur, we are taking a proactive stance to protect the cheerleaders, who represent the University of Florida with enthusiasm and class,” McClain wrote, “and allow them to lead cheers at Gator games for years to come.”Grounded UF cheer

�THE RINK WAS DUE TO 
OPEN MONDAY.

The downtown ice rink, sched-
uled to open Monday, has been de-
layed until Midwest Display Inc. gets the rink set up.
No new date was announced, 
but the rink is expected to be open “as rapidly as possible,” according to a city statement.
The third delay was caused by 
cracks in the lines that will be used to cool the ice, said David Ballard, events coordinator for the city De-partment of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs. 
The cracked PVC pipes will be 
replaced with copper piping.
The rink was originally sched-
uled to open Nov. 23, but it was delayed until Friday — and then Monday — because of some tech-nical difﬁ  culties such as problems setting up the 35-foot-tall tent, said Russell Etling, city cultural affairs programs coordinator.
After the second delay, Mid-
west Display Inc. announced it would offer the ﬁ  rst three days of skating for free.
The company will still offer 
three days of free skating when the rink opens, according to the release.
The delays have raised ques-tions about whether these setbacks will affect the rink’s proﬁ  ts.
Ballard said he’s sure that’s on 
the supervisors’ minds.
“After all, that’s how they are 
making their money,” he said. “But they’re working through the trou-bles that they’ve experienced.”

Miami Bus Service will continue its shuttle 
service between UF and South Florida this 
holiday season despite scrutiny after one of the company’s buses crashed in Miami, killing two people.
The bus service, which is among the com-
muter services used by UF students for trips out of town, was carrying a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses when the driver took a wrong turn into Miami International Airport, according to The Miami Herald. The bus crashed into an overpass that was too low for it to pass under. Two men, ages 86 and 56, died from the crash, according to The Miami Herald.
Mayling Hernandez, co-owner of Miami 
Bus Service, said bus service will continue as usual for UF students.
“This is an accident,” she said. “It’s some-
thing you cannot predict.”UF Transportation and 
Parking Services director Scott Fox said UF doesn’t have contractual agree-ments with commuter bus services.
“We don’t partner with 
them,” he said. “We don’t hire them.”
He said the only control UF has over bus 
services that frequent UF, including Miami Bus Service, is that UF tells the services where they can park on campus. The buses can load students on the Commuter Lot service drive and a bus shelter by the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
Hernandez said the driver in the crash isn’t 
driving with the company anymore.
“We’ve never had an accident,” she said, 
“not even a minor one.”

� HE TAUGHT 99 SECTIONS OF 
REPORTING.
JULIA GLUM
Alligator Staff Writer
Ed Weston has spent 42 years teaching UF 
students about words, but maybe the story of 
his career is best told in numbers.
When Weston retires at the end of this se-
mester, his records show he’ll have taught 156 sections of Public Affairs Reporting, 99 sec-tions of Reporting, 39 sections of writing for mass communications and nine sections of Fact Finding, among others.
“I like working with individual students,” 
he said. “It’s really kind of fun.”
But Weston, 66, didn’t start out with pro-
fessorial goals — even while earning his mas-ter’s degree at Northwestern University, he said, “It was pretty clear to me I didn’t want to teach.”
Weston was an editor at the Omaha World-
Herald when UF’s Robert Simmons asked him to join the faculty at UF’s College of Journalism and Communications, and he did so in 1970.
Since then, Weston has spent a majority of 
his time as a lab instructor, doing hands-on exercises with journalism students, including conducting Applied Journalism classes at The Gainesville Sun.
“You get these bright, hardworking, cre-
ative folks, and they just need a few tools,” Weston said. “Then, you kind of get out of their way and see what they build with them. And I think that’s really neat.”
Department of Journalism chair Wayne 
Wanta said Weston “has been an institution” at the college, noting his consistency and value as a faculty member.
“I wish I could keep him for another 40 
years,” Wanta said.
Though he said he’ll miss the students and 
faculty members, Weston is looking forward to spending time with his family, including his granddaughters, Caitlyn and Emma, and at-tending Gators baseball games. He also plans to travel with his wife, Jean, who has already booked three cruises.

Merslich, a 27-year-old physical 
therapist, said he has never treated a 
patient who was injured because of cheerleading.
In the 2005-2006 school year, 12 
high school and college female cheer -
leaders suffered catastrophic injuries, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That amount has dropped steadily, and in the 2010-2011 school year, one catastrophic injury was reported for high school cheerleaders, and none for college.
UF first-year dental student and 
former cheerleader Patrick Fitzger -
ald, 23, said banning the cheerleaders from stunts was a caring approach, but a quick decision without much research.
Fitzgerald, who cheered from 2008 
to 2012, said the cheerleaders had to get stunts approved by a medical ad-visory board to decide if they were safe to perform. He said he thought the system worked well.
In 2011, about 2,500 women from 
ages 18 to 22 visited the emergency room for a cheerleading related inci-dent, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. That’s about 3,700 fewer visits than for soc-cer related injuries and about 8,100 fewer than for basketball.
“[The UF cheerleaders] are adults 
doing it and understand the risks,” Merslich said.

A Gainesville man was arrested early 
Monday morning after police say he attacked 
another man with a traffic cone near a down-town plaza.
The incident started just after mid-
night when Bruce Mullins, a 62-year-old Gainesville resident, approached a homeless man lying on a sidewalk near the Bo Diddley Community Plaza, located on East University Avenue, and allegedly struck him with an or-ange traffic cone, according to a GPD arrest report.
The victim leapt to his feet and ran across 
a nearby road as Mullins chased after him with the cone.
The victim tried to pull out a pocketknife 
to defend himself, but Mullins struck him “three to four times,” according to the report, before fleeing the scene.
At about 12:30 a.m., the victim called 
Gainesville Police on a pay phone to report the attack. After officers arrived at the plaza, they found Mullins smoking a cigarette near-by, said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
During questioning, Mullins said he didn’t 
have the cone and only fought the victim ver-
bally.
Mullins later changed 
his story, saying he did have the cone and swung it at the victim when he pulled out his knife and began “jab-bing at me,” Mullins said in the report.
Tobias was not able to 
confirm if Mullins was un-
der the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the incident.
Police arrested Mullins on a simple bat-
tery charge and booked him into the Alachua County Jail at about 1:30 a.m. on Monday. He was released later that afternoon.

Shirley Lasseter has been 
sharing her love of film with 
Gainesville for more than 30 years.
In 1979, Lasseter set out to 
convince the Hippodrome State Theatre staff to install a movie theater in its newly purchased downtown building.
The most persuasive argument, 
she figured, would be a movie screening.
So she bought a 16 mm 
projector for $100 and put up a large sheet at the empty warehouse that served as the Hippodrome’s home from 1975 to 1980.
At what could be considered 
the first Hippodrome Cinema event, she projected “The Dove,” an Ingmar Bergman parody, and Richard Nixon’s funding speech where he mentions his dog, Checkers.
“Everybody just loved it,” 
Lasseter, 62, said. “The whole gang was there, and they said, ‘Yes!’”
This year, the Hippodrome 
Cinema is celebrating its 30th birthday. 
Lasseter has been its director 
since the beginning.
The cinema is known for 
bringing foreign, independent and offbeat film to Gainesville.Lasseter has loved film since 
she was a teenager, when she would hop on a bus to see foreign film in Miami art houses.
She can still rattle off the 
titles of European movies she saw decades ago: “A Man and a Woman,” “To Sir, with Love,” “Elvira Madigan.”
At the time, she was inspired 
to become a film director. 
Now, she is the director of a 
program that screens the same genre of artistic, foreign film.
“It cracks your brain open,” 
she said. “It’s a whole different world.”
In 1972, the year the 
Hippodrome was founded, six artists banded together to stage contemporary theater.
Mary Hausch, one of the six 
founders, distributed fliers for a play in a bike shop that Lasseter was working at at the time. 
Hausch and Lasseter knew 
each other from high school and had independently chosen to continue their education at UF.
After seeing the flier, Lasseter 
volunteered in all aspects of the theater. 
She ran the bar. She painted sets. She ushered people in. She once fanned a lighting board to keep it from catching on fire.
The cinema was up and 
running at its new downtown location, 25 SE Second Place, by 1982.
Today, it’s harder to get 
people to pay to see film in an independent theater.
“There’s a point where you 
have to deal with the economics of the situation, no matter what your passion,” she said. 
“You can figure out a new way 
to make it happen or let it go. We decided to figure out a new way to make it happen.”
This September, Lasseter start-
ed a street team to promote films 
at the Hippodrome. 
Hausch calls her an “idea fac-
tory.”
“I don’t think those types of 
things would happen without Shirley,” Hausch said. “The sky is the limit for [her].”
The team promoted “Sleepwalk 
With Me,” one of the recent Hip-podrome films, by announcing the film on UF’s campus while wear -
ing pajamas and sleep masks.
After more than 30 years of 
working with the Hippodrome, 
Lasseter has no intention of retiring.
“For a long time, I was a cinema 
director and it was my job,” she said. “Now, it’s my life.”Theater has ‘idea factory’ for director

They came armed with 
backpacks and brains.
Averaging about 17 heads 
per minute, the students 
flowed into Library West around 1:30 p.m. Monday, the revolving door whirring about and around.
As the semester’s end ap-
proaches, Library West and the Marston Science Library are seeing a high volume of stu-dents, especially those cram-ming for exams. Both libraries have extended hours.
“We do this as a service to 
the students,” said Vernon Kisling, department chair of the Marston Science Library.
More students go to Mar -
ston to finish projects rather than study for exams, he said.
Monday and the weekend 
were some of the busiest days, Kisling said.
About 20,600 students 
visited Library West Nov. 26 through Nov. 28, said Patrick Reakes, department chair of Library West. Those numbers only count those who came up the escalators, not students who went to Starbucks or the downstairs study area, he said.
Though the number of peo-
ple who use Library West has been consistently high over the past few years, it often sees a spike in attendance during fi-nals time, Reakes said.
On Sunday night, a Library 
West attendant opened an in-struction room to make space for more students, he said.
He expects to have more 
than 7,000 students per day throughout the next week. “We’re just solid busy from here to the end of the semes-ter,” Reakes said.Students cram into 
libraries as finals loom
Looking for a place to study?
Library West is open continuously until 6 p.m. on Dec. 
14, according to the George A. Smathers Libraries 
website, and Starbucks will stay open as well.
Marston will be open from 8 a.m. to 3 a.m. through 
Dec. 12.
Other libraries will operate on their normal schedules, 
according to the site.“It cracks your brain

Today’s question: Are you mad that the ice rink still 
isn’t open?
60 TOTAL VOTES22% YES
78% NOMonday’s question: Will you see Mark Cuban speak today? Loser Lohan 
Media should 
probably just lay off
We’ve got trouble, right here in the USA. Trouble with a 
capital ‘T,’ that rhymes with ‘L,’ that stands for Lind-say Lohan.
We don’t necessarily want to talk about Lohan because ev-
eryone talking about her all the time is probably a big source of her problems, but we feel compelled.
She’s become such a source of national ridicule and pity that 
even Mel Gibson wants to help her out. He said in an interview with “Extra” that he reached out to her in the past, and he might do so again. If Mel-tdown Gibson wants to help you with your problems, then you deﬁ  nitely have something to worry about.
It just seems like the more attention she receives in the media, 
the more that terrible things happen to her.
The Lifetime movie about Elizabeth Taylor, “Liz & Dick,” pre-
miered on Nov . 25 to, let’s say , mixed reviews. People magazine said her performance as Taylor was fascinating and terrible.
Los Angeles Times TV reviewer Mary McNamara called it a 
“‘wildly graceless biopic’ ﬁ  lled with more ‘petulance than pas-sion.’”
A few days later, after attending a Justin Bieber concert in 
New York, Lohan went to a nightclub (as she is wont to do). She ended up punching a psychic. We know that sounds like an outrageous story , but it’s actually true. Lohan claims she didn’t punch her accuser, but she said she instead called her a “gypsy” and the psychic’s friend tried to steal Lohan’s purse.
Don’t worry , though, because Lohan is probably going to 
hire a private investigator. The psychic, Tiffany Ava Mitchell, could be trying to make a quick buck.
A few days after that, Lohan’s assets were frozen by the IRS 
“in an effort to recover $233,904 in unpaid taxes from 2009 and 2011 and an unspeciﬁ  ed amount from 2011,” according to TMZ and New York Daily News.
It is a saga. If someone ever makes a biopic of Lohan (could 
be called “Linds Is Sick,” you’re welcome, Lifetime), a lot of it would take place in courtrooms or on Twitter when she fought with Amanda Bynes that one time.
This entire editorial seems like an episode of “Gossip Girl,” 
right? Here’s the point: Celebrities feed off attention and use it to continue to propel them in the direction they are already headed.
Like, if Lohan was on the up-and-up and received attention 
for all her good things, then she would be praised. The cycle would continue, and she would be basically on the same level as someone like Reese Witherspoon.
However, because Lohan had some hard times, the press 
started paying more attention to all the terrible things that either just happened in her life or that she did to herself. The cycle con-tinued, and now she’s just a mess.
Attention breeds similar acts. It’s like training an animal. 
Only give them treats when they do something good, but don’t scold them if they do something bad.
Not that Lindsay Lohan is like an animal, but we all remem-
ber that scene in “Mean Girls.” Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, readers of all ages: Life is chaotic and complicated.
However, it must be the correct combination of 
planned and spontaneous in order to be a hit. Dangerous, thrilling, emotional and unpredictable, life is a circus.
We walk many tightropes and take narrow paths in 
hopes that we don’t fall. Always anxious, we tiptoe through the journey, hoping we don’t fail to succeed.
We are expert jugglers. Always occupied with more tasks 
than we can handle, we somehow manage to stay in syn-chronization.
We are ﬁ  re-breathers, passionate about the things that 
make us come alive. We want to share our passions with the world so much and sometimes sacriﬁ  ce ourselves just to be able to do so.
We jump through rings of ﬁ  re to get to the things we want. 
Many times we put ourselves in danger in pursuit of what we desire. What awaits on the other side could be recogni-tion, applause, self-fulﬁ  llment or simply something better than what we have now. We hope we can make it through the test and say the leap of faith was well worth it.
We ﬁ  nd ourselves ﬁ  ghting to tame the wild lions of life. 
Why do we put ourselves in these kinds of situations in the ﬁ  rst place? Often it’s a necessity . Sometimes it’s just for the thrill of it.
When things get tough, we satisfy our egos by putting on 
stilts to be above everyone around us.
We are trapeze artists. When we ﬁ  nd someone our hearts 
feel we can trust, we repeatedly swing back and forth to them, away from them, until we have the courage to let go and clutch on. All we can hope is that they embrace us and don’t let us fall. We’d be ashamed and embarrassed after get-ting played.
Although places around the world have different inter-
pretations, the concept of the circus is a shared experience, identiﬁ  able and relatable to all. It’s a global phenomenon that people of all walks of life grow to be intrigued with.
Some circus shows are high-class, some are low-mainte-
nance. Some take place in parking lots for free, while others occur in grand auditoriums with high-priced tickets. Some are child-friendly while others are much more serious in nature.
The circus will travel and make 
stops all around the world. Some big tops stay in one city their entire run while others have the chance to see the entire globe. No mat-ter where your own circus goes, remember it’s on the road for a reason.
When it’s all said and done, it’s only an illusion. Eventu-
ally , we lose our possessions, costumes, props and reveal our true selves.
Some of us ﬁ  nd it hard to believe in someone who actual-
ly conducts all of this madness. However, the most fulﬁ  lling circuses prosper because they have a trusting relationship with their ringmaster. We don’t understand every action he takes but conﬁ  de in him enough to abide by his word and believe he is in control of a beautiful experience.
The ringmaster is the most visible and most vital in the 
show.
He is conﬁ  dent, dapper and effortlessly holds the atten-
tion of the audience members watching. His presence is strong enough to make them fear, respect, praise, admire and love him all at once. This master of ceremonies keeps the show moving, even during times that seem rough.
The ringmaster loves us as performers. Even when we 
feel we‘re miniscule or unworthy of attention, he reminds us that we are uniquely created and are spectacular creatures because he made us and molded us into who we are. Even though at times we are unprepared and ungraceful, he con-vinces us we are worth much more. He sees potential inside us we don’t even know exists.
Thank you for being an engaging and responsive audi-
ence on this stop of my own traveling circus.
I hope we all continue to grow and can one day stop the 
adventure, rest and say we were part of a worthy spectacle for our ringmaster.

Letter to the Editor
I am a Gainesville resident and 
have been for 18 years. Sunday 
night, I had the most wonderful musical experience!
This was my ﬁ  rst opportunity 
to enjoy a performance presented by the UF School of Music. Don Suther, a tenor for the Gainesville Civic Chorus Master Chorale, in-vited me to the performance of the UF School of Music’s “Sounds of the Season.”  I wish I had real-ized how truly amazing this ex-perience would be; I would have brought my whole family.
The evening began as the Uni-
versity Concert Choir and the Gainesville Civic Chorus was heavenly singing the “Gloria in Excelsis Deo,” from above me —  in the balcony — while the University Symphony Orchestra magniﬁ  cently performed on the stage of the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. I closed my eyes, breathed in deep and my soul was lifted out of my body to ﬂ  oat in the air with the music. It was a wonderful experience and a beautiful beginning to the Christ-mas season. “African Noel,” per-formed by the Women’s Chorale, the Men’s Glee Club and the Af-rican Percussion, was very up-lifting and cheerful, as was each of the other 12 arrangements. Bravo!
I would like to thank everyone 
involved in this musical experi-ence. The night could not have been more perfect! Each one of you painted a vision in my mind with your very positive energy and amazing talent. Thank you, UF and Dr. and Mrs. Machen, for your very generous musical gift to our community. May God bless all of you with peace and happiness.
Linda S. DiFranco

P .S. The UF radio station re-
corded the whole evening for all of the community to enjoy this season.
Butts are everywhere! 
You ﬁ  nd them at the beach, at 
the park, on sidewalks, in park-
ing lots, sporting events, the list goes 
on. Cigarette butts.  
It is impossible to go anywhere with-
out ﬁ  nding cigarette butts people have 
tossed on the ground.  
We are taught from a very young age 
that we shouldn’t litter. Society encour-ages us to throw our garbage in the trash. Many people in the Gainesville area are familiar with the catchy slogan, “Put it in the can, Gator fan.” Cities organize cleanup days to educate the public and get the community involved. 
It seems the majority of society frowns 
upon someone throwing their burger wrapper or water bottle on the ground.
So why are cigarette butts an excep-
tion to the rule? What makes people turn the other cheek when it comes to the single most littered item in America and worldwide?    
When I asked some smokers for their 
opinion on this matter, most of them had common responses. One of the most common responses regarded the incon-venience of not having more receptacles to throw their cigarette butts in. Others thought cigarettes were biodegradable, and it wasn’t “as bad as throwing other trash on the ground.”  
Many of the smokers admitted to 
not thinking anything of it, saying, “It’s a habit.” Whatever the reasons are, this thoughtless act must stop.
The ﬁ  lters in cigarettes can take as long as 10 years to decompose. They contain toxic chemicals that can seep 
into the environments they are left in. These chemicals can make their way into the soil and waterways, potentially caus-ing harmful effects. The little bit of tobac-co that is left in the cigarette can cause adverse effects to the environment.
What can be done to reduce the litter-
ing of cigarette butts? 
First and foremost, the public should 
be educated on the harmful effects ciga-rette butts have on the environment. Be-havior and attitudes about littering need to be changed, and education about the subject is a successful way to go about it.  
I also propose that the City of 
Gainesville provide more cigarette re-ceptacles for smokers to use. Laws and ordinances enforcing litter ﬁ  nes need to be upheld, even for cigarette butts.   
To those of you who smoke, take 
responsibility for your actions. Make a choice not to litter. If you’re in your car, utilize the ashtray instead of throwing the cigarette out the window. Carry a portable ashtray with you so you will always have a place to dispose of the cigarettes.    
Smokers, please think about what you 
are doing to the environment next time you go to put your butt on the ground.

Speaking OutImagine an AIDS-free generation. This 
could happen, but only if we take the nec-essary steps at this moment. This summer, 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton vowed the United States would maintain its commitment to provide the funding and resources needed to achieve this historic milestone at the 2012 In-ternational AIDS Conference. Dec. 1 marks the 34th World AIDS Day. Although it is important to commemorate the millions of lives that have been lost to HIV/AIDS, it is even more crucial to recognize that this single day represents a greater movement to eventually end AIDS al-together. Impending sequestration cuts that could be enacted in January threaten the pos-sibility of an AIDS-free generation.
Despite challenges combating a disease that 
continuously changes and adapts within the host cells of patients, recent research indicates that it may be possible to control the transmis-sion of HIV . The HPTN 052 study , sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infec-tious Diseases, used a randomized clinical trial to understand whether antiretroviral treat-ment, a combination of drugs already used to treat HIV , could prevent sexual transmission of HIV among couples in which one member was HIV-positive. Remarkably, the study demon-strated that ATRVs as a form of treatment are actually a form of prevention: The uninfected partner does not contract the virus. By provid-ing patients with treatment, transmission of the virus can be stopped.
As a result of Congress’ failed attempt to 
come up with a ﬁ  scal solution to last year’s debt ceiling crisis, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted to reduce the deﬁ  cit by $1.2 trillion in the next decade (starting this Janu-ary). Different sectors will be impacted differ-ently by the cuts, but all will be hurt, and small programs will get hit the hardest. For example, sequestration will be disastrous to health re-search, an area that already struggles with re-ceiving adequate funding.
A 7.8 percent sequester is to be enacted for agencies such as the National Institute of Health, which will lose $2.4 billion, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion ($444 million), and the National Science Foundation ($538 million). On the whole, dis-cretionary funding is projected to decline by $39 billion. In addition, global health funding will be slashed by 8.4 percent across the board. This reduction is estimated to result in an in-crease of global AIDS-related deaths by more than 60,000. Nearly 275,000 people will be left without AIDS treatment and services. Although the Budget Control Act was presented last year, there is still the possibility for Congress to enact another solution by January — a solution that would not put lives at risk.
The ﬁ  ght against HIV/AIDS is perhaps the 
single bipartisan issue of our time.
Lauded by Bill Clinton as a legacy of the 
Bush administration, U.S. efforts to combat AIDS both at home and abroad must continue, even in the most pressing of economic times. Congress should take decisive steps to ensure the U.S. remains an undisputed leader in the ﬁ  ght against AIDS. The ﬁ  scal challenge can-not be used as an excuse to slash domestic and global programs that are keeping patients alive. In the U.S. alone, the onslaught of devastating sequestration would bring lifesaving research to a halt and leave thousands of people without the medicine they depend on for survival.
The time to ﬁ  ght the AIDS epidemic is now. 
As of Sept. 30, the U.S. directly supported near-ly 5.1 million people on antiretroviral treatment through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. This is a threefold increase in four years, up from 1.7 million in 2008. We cannot afford to undercut this progress by defunding domestic and global programs.

The applications may not all be 
in, but UF’s 12th president will be 
selected next month.
David Brown, chairman of the 
presidential search committee, 
wrote in a letter that the commit-tee will interview candidates dur-ing a three-day period from Jan. 10 through Jan. 12.
Search consultant Jan Green-
wood has said the presidents of a couple of major research universi-ties are waiting for the last minute to apply. Florida’s Sunshine Law, which dictates their applications are public record, could cause those applicants to face criticism from their own campuses about seeking a new job.
“They’re going to sit in the 
wings until somebody tells them 
to jump in,” UF spokeswoman Ja-nine Sikes said. “I anticipate it’ll be pretty close to those next set of meetings in January.”
Interviews were originally 
scheduled to begin this weekend. 
“We decided not to hold cam-
pus visits after the fall semester ends or during the holidays, as we want to ensure that all interested parties have an opportunity to ob-serve or be present,” he wrote.

For Sheila Scolaro, a 21-year-
old plant science junior at UF, 
one of the best parts of the holi-days isn’t decorating a Christmas tree. 
It’s watching thousands of 
green poinsettias burst into a sea of red, pink, orange, white and burgundy.
UF’s Environmental Horticul-
ture Club will host its 17th annu-al Poinsettia Show and Sale from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday and 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday at Fifield Hall on Hull Road.
The sale will feature 10 bench-
es displaying a total of 4,000 poin-settia plants, with average prices falling between $10 to $23, Sco-laro said. The presidential poin-settias, which are about 4 feet tall, will sell for up to $75.
More than 30 types of poin-
settias will be offered at the sale, Scolaro said, and a display will give customers ideas on ways to use the different-sized plants.She said her favorite part of 
working with the plants is watch-ing them change color.
“Within about a week’s time, 
the greenhouse goes from a sea of green to a palette of colors,” Sco-laro said.Club president Maxwell Mer -
cer, a 20-year-old plant science junior, said the club receives poinsettia liners in early August from breeders in California, Ger -
many and Holland.
“Students prepare the plants 
by potting, pinching, watering and spacing the poinsettias,” Mercer said.
The proceeds from the sale 
will go toward an international trip for the students in the En-vironmental Horticulture Club, Mercer said. The profits will also help stu-
dents attend a national agricul-ture competition at Auburn Uni-versity next year.
Mercer said he is excited to 
talk to customers and tell them about the work the club has put into producing the show and sale. He said the sale will show people more than 97 varieties of poinset-tias ranging in color, shape and size.
The plants bring “warmth and 
holiday spirit into one’s home or yard,” Mercer said.
Christmas goes beyond red and green at poinsettia saleCAmpus
“Within about a week’s 
time, the greenhouse goes 
from a sea of green to a 
palette of colors.”

 Joker Phillips has been hired as 
Florida’s wide receivers coach and 
recruiting coordinator, the school announced on Monday . Phillips will begin recruiting on Friday . 
  Phillips was ﬁ  red from his head 
coaching position at Kentucky last month after posting a 13-24 record in three seasons. Phillips coached wide receivers for 18 years between Ken-tucky, Cincinnati, Minnesota, Notre Dame and South Carolina before taking the head coaching job at UK. 
  “His background as a head 
coach and the number of years he has coached wide receivers will be a tremendous asset to our coaching staff and players,” UF coach Will Muschamp said. “Joker is obviously very familiar with the Southeastern Conference and has always done a great job in recruiting.”
  Graduate assistant Bush Hamdan 
served as the Gators’ wide receivers coach this season after Aubrey Hill resigned in August. 
  Florida’s wideouts struggled in 
2012, amassing 58 catches for 618 yards and 7 touchdowns as a group. Nationally, 133 receivers racked up more than 618 yards. 
  Quinton Dunbar led Florida 
with 306 receiving yards, tied for No. 395 nationally . Dunbar and Frankie Hammond Jr. were the only UF wideouts to tally more than two catches or 17 yards. 
Bridgewater to test UF: Teddy 
Bridgewater played Louisville’s biggest game of the year in terrible physical shape. But he overcame his limitations to help the Cardinals earn the Big East title and a spot in the Sugar Bowl against the No. 4 Gators on Jan 2.
  The 6-foot-3, 218-pound sopho-
more quarterback came off the bench with his team trailing 14-3 and threw two touchdown passes in a 20-17 conference title-clinching win against Rutgers on Thursday . He did so after suffering an injured left ankle and fractured non-throw-ing wrist just ﬁ  ve days earlier in a triple-overtime loss to Connecticut.
  “I was just ready , and I just had 
that feeling deep down inside,” Bridgewater told The Courier-
Senior forward Erik Murphy’s 
injury could force UF to again shufﬂ  e the lineup against Florida State on Wednesday. See story, page 14.

FIRE JOE MORGAN
  You don’t need an on-
air rant by ESPN ana-lyst Kirk Herbstreit to 
know that Sunday night’s BCS Selection Show was a com-plete joke.
  Seven of the top 15 teams in 
the BCS standings did not earn bids to play in BCS bowls.
  Perhaps the most egre-
gious crime in the whole pro-cess was the snubbing of the four Southeastern Conference teams ranked between sev-enth and 10th: Georgia, LSU, Texas A&M and South Caro-lina. UGA has 11 wins, and the other three have 10 victo-ries each.
  Instead, ﬁ  ve-loss Wiscon-
sin, Louisville and Northern Illinois — NORTHERN IL-LINOIS! — will play in three of the most prestigious bowl games.
  You could even argue that 
Florida State is less deserving of a BCS appearance than the SEC’s two-loss foursome. The Seminoles have defeated only two teams with seven or more victories this season. Talk about a weak resume.
  Aside from only choosing 
two teams to play for the na-tional championship, the main issue here is that conference championships have made a mockery of college football.
  Granted, winning your 
league is hard. But when teams like 6-6 Georgia Tech and 7-5 Wisconsin are on the cusp of winning a conference championship, something is wrong.
  Alabama won the nation-
al title last season without even participating in the SEC Championship Game. Do league titles mean anything nowadays?
  The Fighting Irish are play-
ing for the crystal football, and they don’t even play in a con-ference. Meanwhile, 16 teams that were not the champion of a big six conference this year rank ahead of Louisville in the BCS.
  Wisconsin is unranked.  The powers that be think a plus-one system — set to be-gin in 2014 — is going to ﬁ  x everything. That’s laughable.
  Then again, my proposed 
plan may also seem silly. In fact, it’s probably just one of thousands that will be swept under the rug and forgotten. But here goes nothing.
  First, regardless of my 
opinion of conferences other than the SEC, simply dis-counting the leagues’ cham-pionships will never ﬂ  y. The conference commissioners are the decision makers here, and sticking a giant middle ﬁ  nger in the face of the Big East and the ACC is just not plausible.
  That’s why I propose a 12-
team postseason tournament featuring the six BCS confer-
BCS sham in need of playoff 
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 When Florida takes on Louisville 
29 days from now, Will Muschamp will see a familiar face on the opposite sideline — former Gators defensive co-ordinator Charlie Strong.
  The third-year coach has turned a 
Cardinals team that was 7-6 just a year ago into Big East champions. Louis-ville will be making its second BCS bowl appearance.
  Strong directed UF’s defense for 
seven seasons from 2003-09, winning national championships in 2006 and 2008. 
  His defense ﬁ  nished in the top 
10 four times. Strong had three other stints with the Gators dating back to 1983 as a graduate assistant, lineback-ers coach and defensive line coach.
  Strong acted as interim coach dur-
ing a 27-10 loss against Miami in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 31, 2004, after UF ﬁ  red Ron Zook.
  Strong is featured alongside the 
other 22 head coaches in UF’s history on a plaque near the North End Zone in The Swamp. 
   “I spent so many years there, and I 
just think back; it seems like yesterday we were in the Sugar Bowl playing Cincinnati,” Strong said.
  The Gators defeated the Bearcats 
51-24 in 2009 during UF’s most recent Sugar Bowl appearance. While Tim Tebow accounted for four touchdowns in his ﬁ  nal collegiate game, Strong’s defense held the fourth-ranked Cin-cinnati offense to its lowest scoring output of the season.
  Strong coached Gators linebackers 
Jon Bostic and Lerentee McCray dur-ing his tenure at UF. 
  Strong couldn’t quantify how 
many current Gators he recognizes. Thirty players remain from his time in Gainesville. Bostic and McCray occa-sionally give Strong a congratulatory phone call.
  During his time as a defensive co-
ordinator at LSU and Auburn, Mus-champ got to know Strong. Muschamp admired the job Strong did at Florida, and Strong praised the resurrection in The Swamp this season.  UL coach has UF ties

Coach Billy Donovan may have 
to once again test out a new starting 
lineup.
Forward Erik Murphy is deal-
ing with a hip pointer and has not practiced since facing Marquette on Thursday, Donovan said on Mon-day. Murphy’s status for Wednes-day’s game against Florida State remains unclear. 
“I don’t know what is going to 
happen to the starting lineup right now,” Donovan said. “I would say Erik, based on what he is able to do now … may have something to do with the starting lineups.”
Murphy missed practice on Nov . 
12 because of a migraine. Still, he started against Wisconsin two days later and posted 24 points and eight rebounds in UF’s 74-56 win.
Murphy’s injury gives Patric 
Young a chance to move back into the starting lineup after coming off the bench in Florida’s 82-49 win against Marquette on Thursday . 
Young was held out of the lineup 
for the first time since Feb. 2 after displaying a poor attitude during Wednesday’s practice. 
Scottie Wilbekin made his first 
start of the year on Thursday . Young recorded 10 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks off the bench.
Donovan said the Young is tak-
ing his punishment in stride and showing improvements in practice.
“Patric has responded really well, 
and I am happy with the way he’s re-sponded not only in the game, (but) he’s responded really well in prac-tice,” Donovan said. “That’s what he needs to do. He practiced very well yesterday and affected our team in a really positive way.”
If Murphy misses Wednesday’s 
game, the Gators will have to play a man down for the third time. Florida played its first three games without Wilbekin because of a suspension. Casey Prather missed the season’s first four games due to multiple con-cussions suffered during preseason practices.
After enduring multiple lineup 
changes, Florida believes it can han-dle another one. 
“What has been great about our 
team so far this year is we’ve played with guys out,” Mike Rosario said. “I feel like everyone is prepared. We were without a couple guys during the season already, so I feel like we know already how to do it.”

When the Gators depart-
ed Gainesville en route to 
Michigan on Friday, fresh-man Sydney Moss was not with the team.
Instead, she was with her 
family in Kentucky, mourn-ing the passing of her grand-father, Frank Offutt. 
Offutt, 73, passed away 
Wednesday following com-plications from surgery to treat Pure Autonomic Fail-ure. 
For Moss, the loss was es-
pecially painful. 
Sydney is the daughter of 
San Francisco 49ers receiver Randy Moss, who began playing in the NFL in 1998. Offutt became the father fig-ure in Sydney’s life during Randy’s absence. 
“He’s been a huge influ-
ence,” Sydney said of Offutt earlier this season. “He al-ways told me I could make it.”
Moss reached Michigan in 
time to play in Florida’s 59-53 loss on Saturday. 
She arrived early Satur -
day morning and was driven directly to UF’s pregame shootaround. 
Moss made 5 of 15 shots, 
scoring 11 points and pull-ing down five rebounds in 25 minutes on the floor. Coach Amanda Butler was proud of the way Moss played through grief.  
“We knew that [Moss] wasn’t going to play as much, but when I talked to her right before the game, it was just give us whatever she had,” Butler said. “If she didn’t have anything, that was okay. We all understood that.” 
Moss returned to Ken-
tucky following the game. She missed practice Monday but is expected back tonight 
when Flori-da (5-3) fac-es Troy (1-5) at 7 in the 
O ’ C o n n e l l Center. 
M o s s 
credits Of-futt with 
providing the support that helped launch her basketball career. “Papa,” as she affec-tionately refers to him, was the first person to encourage her to pick up a basketball.  
“When I got older, like 
eighth grade, he was the one that told me I could go somewhere with this basket-ball career,” Moss said. “My whole AAU season, he was there. He would travel with me anywhere.” 
When Moss returns to 
the team, her second family will be ready to help ease the pain, redshirt freshman Car -
lie Needles said. 
“We knew how close 
[Moss] was to her grandpa, and every game we play she is going to be playing for her grandpa,” Needles said. “We are going to help her.”Freshman coping with

Before every round and every 
practice, T.J. Vogel takes a Sharpie 
pen to his Titleist golf ball and marks four letters that signify his mother’s enduring message. 
“Remember who you are.”The words keep him motivated, 
hungry . He has promised himself he will never abandon his game again.
In the spring of 2011 at USC, a 
few bad shots turned into a few bad rounds, influencing V ogel’s swing. His confidence dwindled. His sup-port system was a six-hour plane ride away in Cooper City — 2,713 miles east of California. V ogel hit rock bottom in his play , and the lack of support from his coaching staff put his game in the gutter. 
He was not the player so many 
were accustomed to seeing. 
V ogel is as thin as a nine iron but 
as competitive as Rory McIlroy . His love of competition fueled a success-ful high school career during which he was named the 2007 and 2008 South Florida Sun-Sentinel Boys’ Golfer of the Year. In his senior sea-son, V ogel led Plantation American Heritage to the Florida Class 1A Tournament after winning the in-dividual district and regional titles.   He earned a scholarship to USC.
As a freshman he led the Tro-
jans with a 72.1 stroke average and posted six straight top-25 finishes. He was a freshman All-American in 2009-10.
“I felt really good about where 
things were,” Vogel said.
He continued strong during his 
sophomore year. He finished first on the team in stroke average. 
Two months later, V ogel was set 
to pick up where he left off. 
He still had not won a tourna-
ment, but he was on the cusp. He led USC at one of the nation’s most competitive venues, the U.S. Colle-giate Championship in Alpharetta, Ga., placing second overall in a field of 78. 
The rest of the year seemed set 
up for V ogel. 
However, Vogel struggled dur -
ing the spring. His stat line was a punching bag for criticism.
“I was still playing well and … I 
don’t know, something happened,” V ogel said. “I started to play bad. I came back and kind of lost a little bit of confidence for some reason and lost my game.” 
In Vogel’s first three tourna-ments, he finished in the red just once. He then carded a 1-under 215 at the Amer Ari Invitational. He fol-lowed with a 57th-place finish at the USC Collegiate Invitational al-most a month later. By April, V ogel couldn’t finish in the top three of his own team, let alone the field.
Suddenly , much more than a 
lack of confidence stood in the way of V ogel getting back to the top. His coach was eager to change his swing.
“He didn’t touch me when I was 
playing well,” V ogel said. “But what coach is going to touch you when you’re playing at your best?”
Chris Zambri, a former USC All-
Pac-10 player, was considered one of the nation’s better swing coaches. Zambri was a six-year Nationwide Tour veteran. His experience led Vogel to believe he could help him reach the next level in his career.  
Instead, Zambri started digging 
at Vogel’s mechanics, trying to fig-ure out why his game fell apart. 
“As soon as I started to not play 
at my best, he tried to change my swing,” V ogel said. “He tried to make me cut the ball when I’m a natural drawer.”
V ogel was comfortable hitting draws, and his controlled shot that moves right to left had been success-ful before. 
But Zambri wanted V ogel to cut 
the ball — the opposite of his cus-tomary stroke. The change did not lead to an improvement. 
In seven tournament appearanc-
es from February to June, V ogel’s highest finish was 33rd overall. He finished 38th, 57th, 45th, 33rd, 33rd and 39th in his next six events.
He closed the year with a 113th-
place finish in the NCAA Champi-onships at Karsten Creek. He fell to 139th in the nation by season’s end.
“Going through all these prob-
lems and you’re 3,000 miles away from home, it’s tough,” V ogel said. “Talking over the phone with my parents could only do so much.”
With his game suffering a set-
back, he needed out. 
“I didn’t want to transfer initially 
because I was really close with the team,” V ogel said. “I felt like I was quitting.”
Still, V ogel requested his release 
from USC in the summer of 2011. 
Vogel said he transferred to Flor -
ida to be closer to his family, who lives in Cooper City , and because of his relationship with coach Buddy Alexander. 
“We recruited T.J., and some-
times when you recruit a young man, you just grow very fond of him as an individual,” Alexander said.  “He was a genuine kid.” 
Before arriving on campus, Vo-
gel had a handful of long talks with his parents. He wanted to change. 
“I didn’t battle adversity well out 
in Los Angeles,” V ogel said. “I made a promise to myself when I got here that I was going to do everything I could to be the best I could be.”
He started by regaining his con-
fidence. V ogel’s biggest cheerleader — his mother, Jamie — told him not to lose sight of his ability . He had to believe in it again.
And so he did.In his junior season, V ogel 
notched victories at the Charleston Shootout in Hollywood, S.C., and the SeaBest Invitational in Ponte V edra. He led UF in stroke average (71.3) and helped the Gators to three tournament wins. He was also se-lected to the All-SEC first team and PING All-Southeast region. 
Coach Alexander’s morale 
boosts and positive reinforcement gave V ogel the edge he needed to consistently play at a high level. 
“He’s always reminding me 
how good I am,” V ogel said. “With Buddy , it’s always positive and he’s always lifting me up.”
“You need a coach who is there 
to support you when things are go-ing rough, and that’s the biggest difference between Buddy and the other coaching staff.”
V ogel has thrived since joining 
Florida. His success has led to rec-ognition when he walks in to local restaurants. 
“Nobody cares about golf in 
Southern Cal,” V ogel said. “Not too many people are even involved with the school.”
“Here, people know me. I’ll walk 
into a restaurant and people will be like ‘Hey , you are T.J.’ And I’m like … ‘Yeah?’”
The recognition is deserved. In 
his final season at UF, V ogel has recorded four top-10 finishes this fall and leads UF in stroke average. His 71.3 scoring average his junior season ranks eighth best in the pro-gram’s history . His body of work speaks for itself and says volumes about his potential. 
“[Vogel] has a great desire to be a 
good golfer,” Alexander said, “and he certainly has the talent and skill level to play professional golf at the highest level for a long, long time.”
Jack Nicklaus said confidence 
was the most important factor in golf. No matter how great a player’s natural talent, there is only one way to obtain and sustain success: work.
V ogel has done just that. His 
toughness and aptitude have shined since he transferred to Florida one summer ago. And when his confi-dence momentarily dips, he reflects on what his mother has always told him.

Katie Agostin & Aubrey Stolzenberg  / Alligator Staffence champions and six at-large schools. At-
large bids will be determined by BCS rank-ing.
Conferences other than the SEC, the Pac-
12, the Big 12, the Big Ten, the ACC and the Big East don’t matter. The Boise States of the world can fight for at-large spots.
Independents can either join a conference 
or fight for at-large spots. Notre Dame isn’t special.
The four highest-ranked conference cham-
pions would earn first-round byes.
The two worst conference champions — 
Louisville and Wisconsin this year — would enter an eight-team pool with the six at-large squads. Those teams would then be seeded based on BCS rank. Conference champions would automatically host, while the higher ranked at-large team would host the other two games. As in any other tournament, No. 1 plays No. 8, No. 2 plays No. 7, No. 3 plays No. 6, and No. 4 plays No. 5. 
Once the field is narrowed to eight, the 
traditional bowl games come into play. The quarterfinal and semifinal games would be rotated among the Cotton Bowl, the Capital One Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Rose Bowl and the Fiesta Bowl, with one of the six also playing host to the BCS Nation-al Championship Game.
My proposed playoff system strengthens 
and legitimizes conference championships (the format would likely spur Notre Dame to adopt full ACC membership), creates an ex-citing postseason resembling that of the NFL and, most importantly, gives multiple national championship contenders a fair shot at claim-ing the ultimate prize.
No teams would play more than 17 games 
in a single season. The NFL maximum is 20.
After years of snubs and rip-offs, my pro-
posed playoff format offers a solution. Wheth-er you love or hate my idea, it is far preferable to what we have now.

“Coach Will has done an outstanding job,” Strong said. “He’s 
a really good friend of mine. I know when he took over that pro-
gram, I told him if there was anything I could do, I would be more than willing to help, even though I was moving on to Lou-isville.”
Reports surfaced last week linking Strong to the head coach-
ing vacancy at Auburn. Strong denied rumors that alleged he had been interviewed. 
The various head coaching rumors started back when Strong 
coached at Florida. He’s tired of talking about them.
“I’m never going to deal in rumors,” Strong said. “People can say whatever they want about me. They’ve always said it, but if I didn’t say it, I’m not going to deal with it.”
Strong would rather not face Florida because of his ties to the 
school. He relished his time in Gainesville. 
“You just look at a program that’s been consistent year -in 
and year -out and they are going to compete on a national level,” 
Strong said. “It’s a program of excellence, and I really enjoyed my time there and there are so many memories there.”

Louisville quarterback shines despite injury
Journal on Thursday . “If we were scoring 
points, I wouldn’t play at all.”
Bridgewater added that he was playing 
at just 70 percent.
Now, Bridgewater will have a chance to 
get healthy before the Cardinals make their first BCS bowl appearance since 2007.
Louisville coach Charlie Strong said the 
Cardinals’ training staff has done an “un-believable job” with Bridgewater, and that the quarterback should be healthy by the bowl game. Although Bridgewater was effective 
against the Scarlet Knights, Strong said the Miami native will not rush back to action at the start of bowl practice. 
“We’ve got to be 
smart on how we handle it,” Strong said. “He’ll need 
rest, and how much rest? It will depend on just our medical staff.”
This season, Bridgewater has complet-
ed 69 percent of his passes for 3,452 yards and 25 touchdowns against just seven in-terceptions. He ranks eighth in the coun-try with 8.9 yards per attempt and a 161.6 quarterback rating. 
Florida coach Will Muschamp said 
Bridgewater’s accomplishments have been key for Louisville.
“That was a gutsy performance there 
the other night against Rutgers,” Mus-champ said. “I didn’t see the whole game, 
but I saw parts of it.  Again, a guy that I 
know was very talented coming out of Miami, and certainly has done a fantastic job.”
