  While other universities are con-
sidering the introduction of coed dorms, UF students shouldn’t hold their breath waiting for this change on 
their campus.
  As administration at the Univer-
sity of California at Los Angeles talks 
about the possible addition of gender-inclusive housing, some students at UF are wondering if the same will happen here.
  The University of California at 
Berkeley and Stanford University al-
ready have gender-inclusive accom-
modations. 
  UF has policies in place to address 
special accommodation requests from individuals on a case-by-case basis, in-cluding transgender students. How-ever, not all students currently have the option to room with the opposite sex. 
  If student interest in this type of 
housing were to increase, housing staff would gather input from involved staff, student leaders and administra-tion to review existing policies and procedures, said Sharon Blansett, as-sistant to the associate vice president for student affairs. 
  However, since interest is limited, 
men and women will not be rooming together in undergraduate residence halls in the near future.
  It could take a minimum of three 
years to get the option of having gen-der-inclusive dorm rooms, Blansett said.  Coed dorm

  Mary Reyes doesn’t like spend-
ing money at Starbucks.
  But when the temperatures 
dip, the 20-year-old journalism sophomore layers her clothing, 
eats a bowl of tomato soup and buys a pumpkin spice or ginger-bread latte.
  “If it’s going to be in the 40s, 
I may have to give into tempta-
tion,” Reyes said.Until Sunday, temperatures 
will dip into the low 40s and will 
not exceed 77 degrees, said Al Sandrick, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Jack-sonville.
  It is the ﬁ  rst major cold front of the semester. Lower tempera-tures, however, are normal for this time of year.
    As the weather cools down, 
Starbucks locations on campus see an increase in business, said Jill Rodriguez, marketing pro-gram manager for Gator Dining Services. 
  Students order more hot, sea-sonal drinks like white mochas, peppermint mochas and chai tea lattes.
  Darrel Ambrosini, a 21-year-
old business senior, said he spends more time and money at Starbucks when the weather is cold.
  “I just associate the cold with 
hot drinks,” Ambrosini said.

  UF alumnus Sam Militello’s fondest mem-
ories of college are of current students’ least 
favorite activity: doing homework.  Before graduating in 1961 as a civil en-
gineering major, he pulled all-nighters with peers to meet design deadlines. After ﬁ  nish-ing the projects, they would go out for beers.
  This past weekend, Militello, 74, had 
a chance to reconnect with his class at his Grand Guard 50th Reunion. UF’s Alumni Association sponsored the annual three-day event, which drew 146 guests.
  Class chairman and UF pharmacy and psychology graduate Robert Levitt, 72, pre-sented a class check of about $35 million to Alumni Association President Kelly McKib-ben. The check represents the cumulative to-tal of the class’s donations to the UF Founda-tion over the past 50 years.
  The weekend of nostalgia and memories 
celebrated the 1,350-member class of 1961, said Jasmin Robinson, associate director of Class of 1961 donates $35 million

  Waste: It’s what we do every day. 
One local resident is doing his best to turn 
waste into something valuable.
  Turning food leftovers into topsoil, Chris Cano, 
a 23-year-old UF graduate, started Gainesville Compost: From Waste to Food, a business initia-tive that works with local restaurants to improve their sustainability. Created when organic scraps are recycled and decomposed in a controlled way, compost provides soil with nutrients that stimu-late plant growth. 
  Gardening since high school, Cano said he used 
to spend a lot of money on expensive organic fer-tilizers. He started doing research and read about compost and how people call it “black gold” be-cause it is so useful.
  “I learned that you could essentially recycle 
your fruit and vegetable scraps from the kitchen 
and turn it into a nutritious medium for your gar-
den,” he said.
  The current pilot program started in Septem-
ber and involves ﬁ  ve local restaurants: Midnight, 
Reggae Shack Cafe, Jones Eastside, The Bull and 
Karma Cream. These were the ﬁ  rst local business-
es to hop on board, and they are working toward the Gainesville Compost vision of having a pedal-powered community compost network. 
  The pedal-powered compost bucket pick-up 
and delivery service moves away from fossil fuel-dependent transportation. The waste is collected from the restaurants one to three times each week, depending on the amount of scraps collected. 
Cano said he puts the 5-gallon buckets of waste 
into the trailer attached to his bicycle, pedals to his house, adds the materials to the compost and then returns the buckets. 
  “When I leave the restaurants carrying these 
heavy buckets, I feel good about the fact that we’re diverting waste from the landﬁ  ll and turning it into something valuable,” he said.
  As long as it is economically feasible, he said he 
does not plan on charging for the pick-up service. Cano believes that he and the restaurants have a mutually beneﬁ  cial relationship. 
  As a source for income, he aims to eventually 
sell compost to local gardeners and community 
members. Another goal of Gainesville Compost, 
he said, is to help restaurants set up their own or-ganic gardens that are “powered by the very com-post they are contributing to.” 
  Midnight will be the ﬁ  rst restaurant Cano 
will build a garden for. He described the plan for the garden as “art with a food function.”He said reclaimed wood will be used for the frame, beer bottles will contain the plants and beer caps 
will be used as decoration. 
  Jason Twist, a 30-year-old co-owner of Mid-
night, said he likes the idea of not only having 
something beautiful for the community to enjoy but also having something that can actually be used.
  “Chris is a very driven guy,” he said. “He’s got 
a lot of things on his plate but also a lot of enthu-siasm.”
  As a website developer, Cano said he was look-
ing for a job that was more rooted in the Gainesville 
community. He said this small-business initiative 
has given him a chance to play a small part in 
building the local economy in a sustainable way. 
  “Every morning I wake up, and I go to my gar-
den, and it kind of grounds me,” he said. “Any gardener will tell you there’s nothing like eating a homegrown vegetable.”   UF grad starts compost service for local restaurants
“I learned that you could essentially 
recycle your fruit and vegetable scraps 
from the kitchen and turn it into a        
nutritious medium for your garden.”
Chris Cano
creator of Gainesville Compost: From Waste to FoodThe process would involve an explo-
ration process, writing proposals, gain-
ing approvals and moving to new poli-cies and procedures.
Student opinion on the matter var -
ies.
Tanya Naravane, a 21-year-old mi-
crobiology senior, said gender-inclusive dorm rooms wouldn’t be a good idea.  
“Guys and girls live differently,” Nara-vane said. “It would be awkward trying to dress, and it could cause issues.”
But Carlo Claudio, a 21-year-old 
sports management senior, believes UF 
students should have the  option of liv-
ing in gender-inclusive dorms. 
“I think it would be awesome,” Clau-
dio said. “I don’t think it is a big deal or see any reason why not.”4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2011

Sixty-five alumni were inducted as Grand Guards of UF this year
alumni reunions and special events.
It’s heartwarming to see these Gators “who are still very 
much bleeding orange and blue,” Robinson said.
While sharing stories, the alumni recalled things that in-
spired them on campus and influential professors. 
“It’s just amazing to see the love and passion these Grand 
Guarders have for their university even 50 years later,” Rob-
inson said.
Activities included a UF history presentation, a class semi-
nar on Alzheimer’s disease research and a tailgate party for Saturday’s football game against Auburn University.
Levitt reminisced with friends he had not seen since gradu-
ation.
“Everyone who was there had an interesting story to tell,” 
Levitt said.
The weekend’s focal point was the Grand Guard induction 
ceremony Friday night.To be a Grand Guard member, a person must have received 
his or her first degree at UF 50 years prior, Robinson said.
This year, 65 alumni were inducted by representatives of 
their former colleges. Inductees received a medallion, a lapel pin, a certificate and a copy of a video montage.
Levitt was impressed with the size of the check because it 
shows that “everybody gave something,” he said.
The amount shows how generous people can be, said physi-
cal education graduate Judy Ford. 
She took a picture with the check and sent it to her grandson 
in high school.
“I told him he wouldn’t be getting any money from me be-
cause I gave it all to the university,” Ford said.ALUmNI , from page 1� THE NUMBER OF RECRUITERS ALSO

The Building Construction Career Fair invited 
students and recruiters to mingle from 9 a.m. to 
1:30 p.m. Tuesday in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. 
The fair has changed little since previous years, 
said Kim Stanley, the Rinker School of Building Construction’s job placement coordinator.However, the number of recruiters that attend-
ed  decreased to 43 this year from 47 last year, and Stanley said student turnout seemed lower this 
year, too, but she did not know exact numbers. 
“It’s the lowest number of companies we’ve 
had, but more people are hiring full time,” Stanley 
said. “[There will be] a huge job placement push in two years, and we’re not going to have enough students.”
Brian Bleakly , a recruiter from The Shaw 
Group, also spoke positively about the future of the construction industry.
“[In] any economy that’s brought back up, it’s 
done through construction,” Bleakly said.Construction job fair has low turnout

A Jacksonville-based comedy 
club paired with a UF fraternity 
to bring comedian Ralphie May to campus tonight at 8. 
Comedy Zone is bringing May 
to the University Auditorium be-fore he does a three-day perfor -
mance in Jacksonville. 
Tickets to the show cost $29. 
They can be purchased online through Ticketmaster or at the door. Doors open at 7 p.m. 
May was a finalist on the first 
season of “The Last Comic Stand-
ing.” He has also had various spe-
cials on Comedy Central, such as “Ralphie May: Prime Cut” and “Ralphie May: Girth of a Nation.” His comic style crosses social, eth-nic and cultural barriers, accord-ing to Comedy Zone.  
“Gainesville is the perfect mar -
ket for Ralphie,” said Fred Pozin, 
the owner of Comedy Zone. May has performed in Jacksonville and 
at other universities, such as the University of Central Florida. This 
will be his first time at UF. 
May will be the first come-
dian Comedy Zone brings to 
Gainesville, but Pozin said he won’t be the last. 
“The university is hungering 
for more comics,” Pozin said. 
Pozin has been in the comedy 
business for more than 20 years, 
but Gainesville is a new market for 
him. 
Pozin’s son, business adminis-
tration sophomore Noah Pozin, 19, is a brother of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, which helped publicize the event.  
The Comedy Zone is using May 
as a springboard for other high-
quality comics it hopes to bring to 
Gainesville. 
The intention is to see how 
this event goes and bring other big names to the university, Noah Pozin said. Comedian Ralphie May

Last year’s slowest runner was a basset 
hound.
Saturday , dogs will be able to run alongside 
their owners again at the 30th Annual Dog Days 
Run hosted by the UF College of Veterinary Medi-cine and the UF Student Chapter of the American Veterinary Medical Association.
The proceeds from the 5K run and 1-mile Fun 
Run will go to the Global Alliance for Rabies Con-trol and the Alachua County Humane Society.
The event will also include contests for awards 
such as best costume, smallest dog and best dog-and-owner look-alike.
“My favorite part is seeing the variety of dogs 
that come out,” said Megan Manzie, second-year 
student at UF’s veterinary school and this year’s 
event coordinator.
She said one of the most memorable costume 
contest winners from last year was a man dressed up in a hula outfit and his dog, which sported a grass skirt and a coconut bra.
The 5K run will start at 8 a.m. at Westside Park 
followed by the Fun Run at 9 a.m.
Participants can register online before the 
event or between 6:45 a.m. and 7:45 a.m. Saturday morning. Registration for the run is at dogdays5k.

� ISRAELI SOLDIER GILAD 
SHALIT WAS RELEASED FIVE YEARS AFTER HIS CAPTURE.
CLAIRE MILLER
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Songs and cheers could be heard 
Tuesday night from outside of 
UF Hillel on  University Avenue.  
About 30 people gathered to cel-ebrate the release of Israeli soldier Gi-
lad Shalit, smiling and crying just like 
Israelis in Mitzpe Hila in the northern Galilee in Israel.
Shalit was captured five years ago 
by Hamas, a U.S. State Department-listed terrorist organization, while patrolling the border of Gaza. 
His tank was ambushed, and two 
of his comrades were killed. He was 
incarcerated, malnourished and had 
no contact with the outside world aside from the few interviews he was forced to videotape in Arabic. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced last week that there would be a swap: More than 1,000 Palestinian Hamas prisoners, most of whom had been convicted 
on trials of terrorist plots, would be 
traded for one Israeli soldier. 
On Tuesday, Shalit was flown to a 
Tel Nof air base. 
Josh Kahn, Jewish Agency Israel 
programming director at UF, said the return was an opportunity for the community to join and rejoice in Shalit’s freedom. 
 “In Israel, there is this social 
contract between mothers and the army ,” Kahn said. “The deal is, we send our kids to you, and you have to bring them back.”
Kahn was a sergeant from 2007 to 
2009 in Infantry Nahal, 50th Airborne Battalion.
Frederick Rosenbluth, a Jewish 
studies and family, youth and com-munity sciences junior, said Shalit is a hero. 
“If I had one-eighth of his strength, 
I’d be a proud man.”Hillel hails soldier’s freedom

Ariana Angel likes to line 
her teddy bears up in a row in 
the middle of her room.
The 5-year-old won’t eat 
anything gooey, sticky or 
wet. She’s a voracious reader 
who memorized “Goodnight Moon” after hearing her dad read it once, but she sometimes 
has trouble remembering not to 
tear up her books when she’s 
done with them.
A high-functioning autistic 
child, Ariana was diagnosed 
with the disorder at 2-and-a-
half years old.
“She’s an incredible kid,” 
said her dad, Josh Angel. “She 
has her own way of thinking 
and understanding things, and 
it’s frustrating for her when we 
can’t understand what she’s trying to say.”Angel, 32, is the organizer 
of the Angels & Devils Autism Fundraiser Dance and Cos-tume Party on Oct. 28 at 7:30 p.m. at the Gainesville Dance 
Association hall, 308 W Uni-
versity Ave.
The evening will begin with 
a $5 dance lesson from profes-
sional swing dancer Patti Jobst. 
At 8:30 p.m., two dance 
floors will open. Angel will be playing West Coast swing mu-sic on the main floor, and DJ Chad “Big Daddy” Young will 
be playing a mix of Latin, ball-
room and swing music on the 
second floor.
A minimum donation of 
$10 is required to attend, and 
all proceeds will go to the UF 
Center for Autism and Related 
Disabilities.
CARD provides free servic-
es such as consultation, train-
ing and referrals for parents and caregivers of children with 
autism.
Cathy Zenko, coordinator 
for education and training pro-
grams at CARD, said Angel’s event couldn’t have come at 
a better time as the center re-
ceived a 20 percent budget cut 
this year and is expecting an-other 10 percent cut in 2012.
“Fundraisers have become 
critical to us now,” she said. 
“They’re really keeping us 
afloat so we don’t have to go to more drastic measures like cut-ting staff.”
The dance party is part of a 
larger initiative to give back to CARD, Angel said.
He has teamed with the 
SunShine Eagles Club to cre-
ate monthlong fundraisers 
throughout October to benefit 
the center. 
The total amount raised will 
be sent to the club’s national 
headquarters in Ohio, where 
Angel said he hopes the dona-
tion will be matched.Party to raise funds for autistic kids

People have no excuse 
for bypassing little girl
At some point during your college career, you might have 
heard a classmate or even a professor utter a phrase to 
the likes of “there is no such thing as right or wrong, just 
cultural differences.” 
“How can we be so ethnocentric and judge the actions of an-
other culture based on our own moral prejudices?” 
The 18 people in China that walked by the injured 2-year-old 
girl Yue Yue, lying in the middle of a street after being run over 
by two vans, are all morally reprehensible. Their cultural iden-
tity doesn’t matter. 
We understand that accidents happen. The two drivers of the 
van should certainly be held responsible for running over the 
poor girl. But their actions pale in comparison to the disgusting 
behavior of those who walked right past her. 
The surveillance footage captured a man on a bike who, after 
noticing the girl, slowed down and looked, then continued on his way . 
An atrocity like this would never happen in the U.S. There 
are countless stories of bystanders lifting burning cars off of 
people involved in accidents. 
Sure, we cannot expect that one person has the ability to lift a 
bus, but if a girl is lying in the street, no one would pass by her 
without trying to call for help. 
We have no background in anthropology, sociology or psy-
chology, so it is hard for us to make assumptions about why this 
happened. 
We can, however, judge this situation as being downright 
evil on the part of the bystanders. But how can we explain the 
“why?” 
We are often taught that eastern cultures tend to be more 
collectivist than in western countries. So why did it take the 19 people to see the girl before someone called for help? 
To be clear, we aren’t saying that Chinese people are inher -
ently evil or that they are worse than Americans. However, there 
is something wrong with the individuals who were caught on 
tape walking by Yue Yue. 
Blaming this incident on China’s economic boom or some sort 
of newfound “opportunism” or “materialism” in which all mo-rality is suddenly lost seems too simplistic of an explanation. 
There has to be more to it than this. Were people afraid to help her? Were they afraid they would 
be framed for hurting her, given the surveillance cameras in the 
area? 
According to the U.K. Daily Mail, “high-profile law suits 
have ended with good Samaritans ordered to pay hefty fines to 
individuals they sought to help.”
Let us hope that Yue Yue, who is currently in a coma, will 
make it through this terrible situation. 
Let us also hope that she will never have to see this sort of 
behavior in her community again. Quitting can sometimes be a good thing
From as early as we can remember, we are told, “Quit-
ters never win. Winners never quit.” 
The phrase, as cliche as it is, has been ramrodded 
into the American psyche because of our history of tenacity and vigilance. 
Is that really true? Think about it. Is there ever a point in 
our lives when it is okay to give up or throw in the towel? 
Americans need to learn to be better quitters. However, 
that is not to say people should forgo their labors and in-vestments when everything goes south. 
Persistence should be heralded as a virtue. It paves the 
way for innovation and progress, but eventually, some pur -
suits should be left by the curb with the rest of the trash.
As any musician would tell you about tempo, quitting is 
all about the perfect timing.
Economists refer to the investment and time spent on a 
particular project, whatever that may be, as the “sunk cost.” This concept also goes hand in hand with “opportunity cost,” which is the loss of potential benefits that could have been received if you had chosen alternative ventures other than those pet projects to which you have been devoting your entire life to. 
Businesses do this when they try to develop new tech-
nologies and innovations in their respective fields. They de-velop hundreds of ideas but use only two if they are lucky. 
Great businesses know when to cut and run. Why would 
you spend all of your energy and time on something that will not work out.
To be candid, I am the biggest quitter I know. If I do not 
like something or, if after a while, I decide that crunching a bunch of numbers is not for me, I drop it faster than if my hands were on fire.
Growing up playing baseball taught me how much I do 
not have patience for being unproductive. Baseball is slow and boring, and I simply do not care about filling a posi-tion in the outfield on the off-chance a ball might come my way. Unfortunately, my mother 
would not let me quit until I reached the age of 14, which I did not appreciate because my once-naive love of sports had long since been six feet under. 
In a tournament, the coach 
benched me and my brother. We played outfield once in an inning; 
that was the extent of our play time. It embarrassed me. I was being forced to play baseball, which consisted of me being forced to watch other kids play baseball.
I did not understand the reason I was here — to learn 
persistence or work ethic? 
My brother and I quit the next day. Thankfully, an un-
derstanding and loving mother let that happen. She spear -
headed the move. 
I could not have been happier. My brother reciprocated 
the feeling. No more wasted afternoons of playing catch on the field. Naturally, I allocated my time to more press-ing matters like defeating Bowser in “World 8” for the 11th time. 
In all seriousness, it is as necessary to know when to stick 
something out as it is to just drop the ball and walk away. Our lives are not only constructed by the things we do, but also by the things we do not choose to pursue. 
Students are coerced by outside sources to pursue goals 
and majors that do not personally resonate with them. 
It is okay to quit. In fact, I encourage you to quit, es-
pecially those freshmen who are in the weed-out classes. Move on.
Quitting should not be looked down upon as a sign of 
failure or shame. Quitting can sometimes open up opportu-nities you might have otherwise never had. 
After all, the late Steve Jobs was a quitter. Nicholas Butler is a journalism sophomore at UF. His col-
umn appears on Wednesdays.

Letter to the Editor
Oregon takes steps in right direction
Oregon’s Court of Appeals recently 
overturned a long-standing rule that 
banned firearms on university campuses. 
This ruling is yet another data point on 
the trend toward restoring the rights of li-censed, of-age individuals to defend them-selves while pursuing their education. 
The original suit was filed by the Or -
egon Firearms Federation on behalf of Jeff Maxwell, a student and U.S. Marine, who was arrested for carrying a small derringer pistol on campus for personal protection. 
The charges were later dropped, but Max-
well was suspended from school for vio-lating the ban on firearms. 
The most recent verdict stated that the 
university policy was an attempt to regu-late firearms not authorized by the legisla-tive assembly and, therefore, is preempted by state law.This decision follows efforts in more 
than a dozen states over the past year to repeal restrictions on campus carry, many of which had support in the legislature, 
but were defeated by technicalities and 
opposition in committees. Another bill in Arizona made it through the Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. Jan Brewer on the grounds that ambiguous language still left 
firearm owners at risk of persecution. 
However, in a sweeping move, Wis-
consin went from being one of only 
two remaining states with no provi-
sions for carry to allowing concealed 
carry, including on university campuses.  
In the general public, there is still much debate over the need to restore the right of self-defense on college campuses, but 
much of the opposition is based on fun-
damental misunderstandings of the goals of the campus carry movement and mis-information on the subject of gun rights in general. Providing education and explana-tions on the subject is one of the main tools used by student and community groups 
such as Students for Concealed Carry to 
garner additional support for their cause.
One of the most common concerns is 
that campus carry would cause every stu-dent on campus to suddenly be armed. 
However, the truth is that Florida law still 
requires individuals to be 21 years old and pass a series of background checks to ob-tain a concealed carry permit. About one 
percent of Florida’s population currently 
holds a carry permit, which would result in about 500 lawfully armed citizens on campus. These same citizens currently carry in grocery stores, movie theaters and 
restaurants without incident, so campus 
would be no different.
Rulings like those in Oregon take es-sential steps toward the elimination of “defense-free zones” where university and 
state rules ensure that the only people who 
are armed are those who intend to break the law in the first place. 
The fact that we trust and rely on stu-
dents like Jeff Maxwell to defend our coun-
try and walk the streets of Fallujah with 
an M16 assault rifle and then deny them the right to defend themselves when they pursue higher education is both ironic and 
sad. 
In a time and place where security and 
police are not able, nor required by law, 
to protect every individual student and faculty member, denying them the ability 
to defend themselves is reckless and irre-
sponsible.

The protests of the “99 percent” occupying Wall Street 
and the rest of the country are inspiring because they showcase the frustrations of the American people — 
how they have been screwed over by the upward vortex of wealth-sucking via manufacturing and customer-service jobs 
going overseas, and the growing disparity between the income 
of your average CEO and your average worker (now 475-1 in America).
They will not, however, effect any real change that ordinary 
Americans really desire until legislation forces the hands of the greedy haves. 
The Occupy Wall Street movement must get organized, 
form a political party and use the strength of its voting power. Otherwise, after the dust settles and the 99 percent go home or 
get arrested, it will just go back to being business as usual in the 
good ol’ U.S.A. 
This is a difficult prospect because Americans continue to 
seem strangely apathetic about straying away from the tradi-tional two-party system, despite the recent gridlock in Wash-ington and the economy going down the poverty tubes. 
Although certain honest and noble independent candidates 
would often be a voter’s first choice in an election, people are largely afraid to vote for such candidates because they feel do-
ing so would likely take votes away from their second-choice 
on either side of the traditional political fence. Independent candidates are often only seen as spoil-ers as opposed to realistically viable options.
There seems to be something in-
trinsically wrong with this in the face 
of the American spirit. Couldn’t there be a system that opened up elections to more than just two parties, in which voters don’t feel encumbered if they simply wish to vote their conscience? Of course, as you may have already suspected, there is such a system — the only question that naturally arises is why it is not being implemented.
Actually, it is, but only on some local levels like in Minneap-
olis and Oakland.  Ranked voting basically works by ranking candidates in descending order when you vote. 
I, for example, voted for Barack Obama during the Demo-
cratic primaries of 2008, but I really wanted to vote for Den-nis Kucinich. Kucinich had already dropped out of the race by then, possibly because people who liked him weren’t voting for him because they possessed the very same mentality that I had — they were afraid to cast a spoiler vote and thus get who they perceived to be the worst of the other evils elected. 
Now, in the face of of greedy banks and corporations drain-
ing America dry , it looks like a honest and valorous stand-up 
guy like Dennis Kucinich, who actually knows the facts, would 
have been golden right about now.A ranked voting system would really help to satisfy the 
hunger of the 99 percent because in such a system, wealthy business interests can’t so easily control the public’s voting habits through the stranglehold of the two-party system. Once that’s done, the public could vote its conscience without fear of 
casting spoiler votes and hopefully be able to elect honest poli-
ticians (a seeming oxymoron these days) who are not bought and sold by the lobbyists of these giant corporations.
Ranked voting gives each voter the ability to cast first, sec-
ond and even third-place votes, in order to successfully avoid this quagmire. It can also be used to provide a percentage-based representation in Congress, as opposed to the winner-take-all system.
Conspiracy theorists have been claiming that the Repub-
licans and Democrats merely represent different sides of the same coin for their wealthy shadow masters for years, and they have been labeled nuts by the mainstream. 
Well, of course, some of them probably are nuts, but many 
of them have valid viewpoints that should be considered on their individual merits. The more each and every one of us be-comes a critical thinker, however, the closer we’ll get to holding the real key to creating tangible positive economic and political change in America through the only thing we really have: our 
voting power.

Student Government executives spoke in 
support of the proposed Reitz Union renova-
tion at Tuesday’s Student Senate meeting.
Student Body President Anthony Reynolds 
said renovating and expanding the building 
would be “phenomenal,” and he asked Trea-
surer T.J. Villamil to explain the project to the Senate.
UF’s Local Fee Committee recommended 
last Wednesday that the Reitz Union be reno-
vated and expanded. The project would be 
funded by leftover student-fee money, fees that students already pay and outside funding.
Villamil said the renovation and expan-
sion would not require extra student fees. The 
committee has recently raised fees by 5 percent 
yearly, a practice Villamil said will continue.
Villamil said after the meeting that the idea 
has garnered support from students and stu-dent organizations, especially if students don’t 
pay an extra fee.
He said he wanted to fully explain the fi-
nancing of the project to senators. 
J. Wayne Reitz Union Board of Managers  
Chairman Sean Fahy plans to present the pro-posal at next week’s Senate meeting. Fahy said 
he will also speak to other student organiza-
tions before the UF Board of Trustees votes on 
the recommendation in December.
Fahy said the expansion would benefit 
all students and student organizations. The expansion would likely include lounge and 
study areas, and more space for student orga-
nizations.
“This is not something that one party really 
supports,” he said.
District C Senator Carly Wilson said some 
areas of the Reitz Union need to be changed, but she said the yearly 5 percent fee increase doesn’t need to happen. Wilson suggested re-examining the SG budget, where she said 
funding could be found.8, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2011

Student Body Treasurer T.J. Villamil urged student senators at Tuesday night’s meet-

After 11 years, the Alachua County Environmental Protection Department is 
moving its office to a new location at the Seagle Building Annex. 
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
SG executives voice support for Reitz renovation
MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Staff Writer
The employees of the Alachua County Environ-
mental Protection Department are moving on.
After 11 years, the organization is leaving its head-
quarters at the Union Street Station on Southeast Sec-
ond Avenue.
While it is changing offices, it is keeping its loca-
tion downtown. After the move, the EPD will be lo-cated in Suite 106 of the Seagle Building Annex at 408 W University Ave., according to an Alachua County Communications Office news release. 
The move, prompted by a time of tight economic 
budgets, should save the department about $25,000 a year, said Chris Bird, the EPD director for Alachua County . 
That figure takes into account the one-time costs of 
the move, which include moving costs to physically transport office items as well as technical costs for set-ting up the computer system in the new office. 
“We are all dealing with funding issues,” Bird said 
of his department as well as other local agencies. 
Although the new office is cheaper in the long 
run, it is also smaller. Compared to the EPD’s current headquarters, which spans about 8,500 square feet, 
the new office is about 7,000 square feet. 
The department also no longer uses workspace 
that it has subleased from the St. Johns River Water 
Management District for about 15 years, he said. The latter organization eliminated its Gainesville office, which it shared with the EPD, because budget cuts.
The move will take about a week, as office furni-
ture and equipment are taken to the new location.County department moving into Seagle Building AnnexJENNA BOX

More than rain is over Spain’s 
plains.
A collaboration between 
Spain and UF initiated research 
in small-satellite technology Fri-
day in Madrid. 
Florida Lt. Gov. Jennifer Car -
roll and Spain’s Minister of Sci-
ence and Innovation, Cristina Garmendia, signed a letter of understanding on Friday, ac-cording to a Space Florida news release.
The collaboration is to initiate 
technological development for agriculture in food and the ag-ing population. 
“[The satellites] have the 
potential to enable rapid turn-around and low-cost experi-ments in space,” said Eric Ford, 33, an associate professor in as-tronomy.
Spain has been building its 
own small satellites for years but 
had to launch from Russia and 
France due to lack of launching 
resources.
Kennedy Space Center will 
help integrate UF’s experimen-tal satellites with Spain’s satel-lites, according to an agreement signed in September.
In an effort to cut costs, sat-
ellites will be attached to larger 
spacecraft sent by entities like 
the Defense Department.
The first launch could happen 
as soon as February 2012, said astronomy department Chair -
man Rafael Guzman in a news release. He was in Spain over the weekend and could not be reached for comment due to his 
travel schedule.
Once in place, the satellites, 
which range in size from about 4 
cubic inches to 3 cubic feet, will be able to detect and monitor crops for diseases.
The UF Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences will lead in trying to find a new technol-
ogy to help growers. In Spain, 
a similar agency will begin par -
allel research, according to the 
Space Florida release.
The agreement offers more 
access to space for UF and Spain 
to continue these projects.
“Going to space is a big deal,” 
Ford said. “This could benefit the commercial space industry in Florida.”
Carroll said she hopes the re-
search will create jobs in the in-dustry as well.
“As space technologies move 
from the laboratory toward the commercial market, more than ever collaboration is needed,” she wrote in an email. UF, Spain

Though he remains hope-
ful that John Brantley will be 
ready for the Georgia game 
Oct. 29, coach Will Muschamp 
said Tuesday that Florida’s 
starting quarterback will not 
practice this week.
Brantley, who suffered a 
sprained ankle Oct. 1 against 
Alabama, has not practiced since the injury occurred. He was on the sidelines in a walk-
ing boot this past weekend, 
when Florida played Auburn.
Brantley will throw this 
week, but Muschamp said the 
redshirt senior won’t be ready 
until his side-to-side movement improves — an action that puts stress on the ankle.  
“He’s living in the training 
room,” Muschamp said. “He’s doing everything he can do to get back. It’s been very frus-trating for him and us.”
Asked whether Brantley 
would be allowed to play if still limited, Muschamp said that decision would be between the 
quarterback and the trainer, 
Anthony Pass. 
This week, freshmen Ja-
coby Brissett and Jeff Driskel will split repetitions. Brissett 
played the first half at quar -terback against Auburn, and 
Driskel took snaps in the sec-ond. Neither was effective, as the Gators managed just 128 passing yards.
Earmuffs: Muschamp apol-
ogized Tuesday for using pro-fanity on the sidelines Satur -
day. After running back Chris 
Rainey muffed a punt in the 
first quarter against Auburn, Muschamp could be heard on ESPN ripping the referees. The blog sportsgrid.com 
posted a video of Muschamp’s rant with isolated field audio minutes after it happened Sat-urday night, and the clip has 
since gone viral.
After calling for a fair catch, 
Rainey bobbled the ball, and 
Auburn recovered. As Rainey 
was trying to field the ball, a 
Tigers player ran close by, and after the play Rainey signaled to the refs that he thought kick-catch interference should have been called.
Muschamp also argued 
with the refs, and he continued to berate them after calling a 
timeout. 
The coach came to 
Gainesville with the nickname 
“Coach Boom,” a label he 
earned because of his dramatic 
sideline demeanor at Texas and Auburn. Muschamp has

Last season, Mike Rosario went 
from being the leading scorer on a 
Big East team to a practice player.
After transferring from Rutgers 
in April 2010, Rosario was forced to spend games biding his time on UF’s bench. When the Gators needed a big shot, he could only be a cheerleader.
In just more than two weeks, 
Rosario will have a chance to change that role. Following a year in limbo, he’s looking for a step forward in his playing career, not another setback.
“It feels like I have waited a de-
cade, two, three decades to play,” said Rosario, a redshirt junior. “That’s how long it felt. But I’m 
e x c i t e d , and it’s here. It’s time, and 
all of that hard work I did through that whole year I had to sit out, it’s going to pay off now.”
Last year was a humbling ex-
perience for a sharpshooter who scored a team-best 16.7 points per game his last season with the Scarlet Knights. Rosario was the program’s first McDonald’s All-American and just the second sophomore in Rutgers’ history to reach 1,000 points. 
“He could’ve got mad or frus-
trated by sitting out, but he was always cheering us on,” junior guard Kenny Boynton said. “And in practice, he worked hard and he pushed us.”
Before coming to Florida, the 
6-foot-3 Rosario, who can play both guard positions, said he had never gone more than two weeks in his career without playing an actual game. 
That’s not to say he still didn’t 
get a workout on the sideline    Rosario

Guard-heavy Gators must go back to roots 
After an 8-year period of mostly grind-
it-out play, the 2011-12 Florida bas-
ketball season will finally mark the 
return of Billy Ball. 
With three vaunted frontcourt seniors 
heading out and two more talented guards 
coming in, the Gators are going to have to 
pick up the pace and force teams to fight for 
every inch of the 94-foot court. 
“Because we have speed and quickness 
in the backcourt, we really need to try and 
get up the floor and try to be a more full-
court defensive team,” coach Billy Donovan said. 
To the naked eye, that style may have always been there. But a look at the 
numbers shows oth-
erwise. 
Since 2002-03, 
only one Florida team has ranked in 
the top 45 percent of 
the country in tem-
po rating — a metric that estimates a team’s playing speed by calculating possessions 
per minute
Even that group, which won the 2005-06 
national championship, had just a 67.9 rat-ing, placing it near the middle of the pack in Division I. And the Gators only slowed 
things down from there. 
That trend reached its lowest point last 
season, when Florida’s 64.1 tempo rating was 290th of 345 Division I teams, accord-
ing to Kenpom.com. With Florida’s best at-
tack options on the interior, the Gators all 
but abandoned the run-and-gun style. Rath-
er than jacking threes in transition, UF let 
Vernon Macklin set up on the blocks for his 
patented hook shot.
That was all well and good, but Macklin 
and Co. are gone.

Guard Jaterra Bonds was a spark for Florida last season, averaging nearly 15 
points per game as the Gators finished the season on a 6-2 run. 
� SHE AVERAGED 9.9 POINTS AND 2.5 
ASSISTS PER GAME LAST SEASON. 
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Writer
During a trying season, Jaterra Bonds helped the 
Gators hold it together.
Florida added six players to the fold last year, 
leading to a season filled with growing pains.
Turnovers and blown leads proved costly as the 
Gators spent the season adjusting to their new team-
mates’ playing styles and in-game tendencies.
Luckily for Florida, Bonds contributed from the 
get-go.
“She really has … a toughness about her,” coach 
Amanda Butler said. “(She has) a presence that, as a coach, you better go and find it in recruiting, be-cause it’s something that I don’t think we can put in them.”
Bonds ranked second on the team with 27.1 min-
utes, 9.9 points and 2.5 assists per game last season, and she set a freshman school record by appearing in 34 games.
Perhaps her finest stretch came during Florida’s 
6-2 run to end the season.
In those eight games, Bonds averaged 14.9  points 
per contest, including a then-career-high 22 in a 74-71 upset victory at home against then-No. 22 Georgia.
She surpassed that mark nearly one month later, 
leading Florida with 23 points in a season-ending 81-77 overtime loss to Charlotte in the Women’s Na-tional Invitation Tournament.
Bonds’ play earned her a spot on the 2011 South-
eastern Conference All-Freshman squad.
“That made her hungrier for more,” Butler said. 
“She’s definitely the type of competitor —  especially at the point guard position — that you have to have 
if you’re going to have a team that’s going to do 
some special things.”
Bonds echoed her coach’s sentiments, admitting 
she wants “bigger and better things” this season.
One aspect of her game that Bonds has worked 
on is the precision of her passing, which she believes 
will improve now that she is more familiar with her 
teammates.
Bonds also said she has placed an increased focus 
on defensive intensity, a skill the entire team worked on during the summer.
“We’re (like-minded) when we start talking 
about things like toughness and how we want to be perceived,” Butler said.
With 10 players returning from last season’s 
squad, the Gators expect to be a team worthy of an NCAA Tournament bid come March.
Butler’s plan to get Florida back to that level, put 
simply, is to “win more games.”
The Gators won five more games last season than 
they did during the 2009-10 campaign, a feat that, if repeated, should get them back to the Big Dance.
Florida has the experience to get there. But as the 
point guard, Bonds will have to set the tone.
“We kind of panicked and didn’t expect certain 
things to happen (last year),” she said. “You don’t ever want to forget (a mistake) because you don’t 
want it to happen again.”Bonds works to build on strong freshman year

The Gators entered Tues-
day with a 10-stroke lead. Turns 
out the cushion was more than enough. 
Florida went 3-over in its final 
round to hold on and win The Bake at the par-72, 7,344-yard Ocean Course in Kiawah Island, S.C. The tournament victory is the team’s first of the season.
The Gators finished with a 
score of 858 (291-276-291, -6), 11 shots ahead of UAB. 
Coach Buddy Alexander said 
he was proud of how his team rebounded after a disappointing showing at the rain-shortened Inverness Intercollegiate on Sept. 27.
“For them to bounce back and 
play well here was pretty cool,” he said. “We’ve worked pretty 
hard all semester, and it’s nice to 
get that first win of the year on a great golf course. This was a very positive couple of days. I’m not incredibly shocked or surprised, since I knew we were certainly better than how we played [the last two events].”
Junior Tyler McCumber shot a 
211 (-5) but fell to No. 2 in the in-dividual standings after tallying two bogeys and a double bogey on his final five holes. He sat atop the leaderboard for most of the tournament, but UAB’s Sam Love (-7), who made four birdies on his back nine, jumped McCumber to earn the individual title. 
“Tyler is a 
very talented player,” Alexan-der said. “He’ll learn and get bet-
ter from this, but I’m proud of the way he’s played all year. This is the first tournament where he’s ... hit the ball with a lot of confi-dence.” 
Adding to his impressive 
third-place tournament finish, junior T.J. Vogel used three bird-ies and 13 pars to card a 1-under 71 on Tuesday . Junior Tommy Mou shot even par and recorded a team-high 14 birdies during the two-day span.
V ogel finished with his 
second top-five result of the 
season, while Mou tied with 
five other golfers for seventh.  
In all, four Gators finished inside the top 20. 
“Tyler and T.J. have been car -
rying us around a little bit this year, and they got some help,” Alexander said. “Two guys can’t do it by themselves.
“The bottom line is that we 
got some stuff from some other people this week, and the results were obvious.”

Blood trickled down his face. 
Gravel dug into his wounds. His 
swollen ankle seemed to be hiding a baseball.
Mark Parrish’s first week of school 
was tougher than yours.
Friday morning, Aug. 19, the 
sophomore UF runner rode his rac-
ing bicycle down University Avenue 
on his way to a more challenging area for riding. But there was no bigger challenge than when he was struck by a turning car. 
The vehicle was turning into a 
shopping plaza, but the woman driv-ing never looked to see if there was 
someone in the bicycle lane. There was nothing for Parrish to do but 
brace for impact — and hope it wouldn’t affect his 
season.
“I knew it was 
going to happen,” 
Parrish said, “but there was nothing 
I could do about it, which was the worst part.”
He gathered himself and stood to 
see what concerned him most at the time — his bike. 
“I actually looked down at the bike 
and said, ‘Ah man! My bike is messed up,’” he said.
His focus quickly shifted when he 
returned to the Lemerand Athletic Center with his coach, Todd Morgan, 
to hear his ankle might be broken. 
“When someone tells an athlete 
something might be broken, it’s a re-
ally scary thing,” Parrish said. 
Morgan was just happy Parrish 
was OK — at first. Then it hit Parrish:  he was “not OK running-wise.”
Finding out Parrish’s injury was a 
sprain was a relief in some sense, but 
Morgan still wanted to be cautious.
“He just had to be patient. It had to 
heal,” Morgan said. “I kept reassuring 
him he was still fit and the meet that counts were still a long time away.”
It didn’t take long for Parrish to be 
back at 100 percent, as just a month later he finished seventh overall at the Gators’ home meet. Three weeks 
later, he led his team with a career-
best 8K time. His performance in Wisconsin on Friday earned him co-Southeastern Conference Men’s Run-ner of the Week honors. 
Two weeks of intense rehab, which 
included pool and bicycle workouts, gave Parrish a reason to be discour -
aged. But he and Morgan agree that positivity was key to Parrish recover -
ing rapidly . 
“As an athlete, you have to be 
able to face that kind of diversity and challenges,” Parrish said. “And that’s what makes an athlete; it’s not just the 
guy who can train the best.”
The SEC Championship is his next 
challenge, but the best part for Par -

UF Golfbeen criticized at times this season for 
the same antics, though he made it clear Tuesday he does not plan to change.
“It’s hard when you got a 6-year-
old and a 10-year-old at home,” he said. “You got to go home and explain to them what you said. … As far as the 
sideline stuff is concerned, we’re going 
to be who we are. I’m just apologizing for the language. Nothing else.”
Injuries: Cornerback Jeremy Brown 
(sprained knee) will take reps in prac-
tice this week, Muschamp said. Brown 
has been sidelined since the first week of training camp in August.
The coach also said running back Jeff 
Demps (left ankle), wide receiver Andre Debose (leg), running back Mike Gillislee (unspecified), Buck linebacker Ronald Powell (unspecified), kicker Caleb Stur -
gis (strained leg) and guard Dan Wenger 
(lower leg) will practice this week.

“There was times where I was so 
sweaty,” Rosario said. “I’m not gonna 
lie: so sweaty from jumping around, but I knew it was for the better and it was to help my team.”
Like former UF center Vernon Mack-
lin, a transfer from Georgetown, Rosario felt the toughest part of the season was when conference play started. 
He would look at the scouting re-
ports, eat the pregame meal and watch his teammates get pumped before tipoff, 
but he wasn’t a part of the action. Work-
outs were Rosario’s version of a game.
“Oh, man, I wanted to grab a uniform 
so bad sometimes,” he said.
Since the preseason, Rosario has had 
another obstacle placed between him and the court: a disc problem in his 
lower back. The injury caused numbness 
and tingling down his legs, but Rosario said he is feeling much better after treat-
ment.
Coach Billy Donovan said Rosario’s 
back injury won’t require surgery, and 
he doesn’t think it will affect his playing time this year.
“Because he understands his back, I 
don’t see Mike just dealing with the pain 
and not saying anything,” Donovan said. 
“I think he understands in order for him to get treated that it’s only going to get worse if he does that.”
As the only player other than Erving 
Walker entering his fourth year of col-
lege basketball, Rosario believes he will 
bring leadership to the team. He also 
didn’t place as much emphasis on scor -
ing this summer; instead, he tried to im-
prove as a defender.
After a “really, really bad” first prac-
tice defensively, Donovan said Rosario made strides later in the weekend and should contribute immediately for Flor -
ida.
“I think I’m too excited, actually,” 
Rosario said. “I might need to like take a cold shower before my first game, be-cause I’m so hyped to get out there and play.”

Guard Mike Rosario sat out last season after transferring from Rutgers, and he is 
fighting an injured back and a deep roster for playing time this year. 
Rosario trying to overcome back injury, time off

will not change demeanor
year’s roster — Brad Beal, Kenny Boynton, Erik Murphy, 
Casey Prather, Mike Rosario, Erving Walker, Scottie Wil-
bekin, Will Yeguete and Patric Young — there is just one 
true center and one true power forward. 
That will result in a lot of three- and even four-guard 
lineups, which can mean only one thing: The Gators will run. A lot. 
And that’s right up Donovan’s alley. In his first six years at Florida, from 1996-97 to 2001-02, 
his slowest team played at a tempo of 71.6 (2001-02). The fastest was the 1997-98 team at 75.4. For perspective, that team would have ranked as the third-fastest squad in the 
nation last year. 
“Being that we have a lot more depth and knowing that 
in the past coach Donovan liked to press a lot, I think we’ll 
be a much more fast-paced team,” Walker said. 
Wilbekin and Boynton, perhaps the team’s two best de-
fenders, said they would like to see that shift. 
“We’ll be a trap team,” Boynton said. “We’re going to 
press and we’re going to run. … I like that.”
Said Wilbekin: “I love playing defense. I love running, so 
it sounds good to me.”
Prather, who ranks next to Boynton and Wilbekin in dis-cussions of defensive ability, said the press would be a good way to use his athleticism. 
Even Florida’s bigs have bought into the idea. Well, sort 
of. 
“As long as I’m in the back of the press just chillin I’m 
fine with that,” Young said, joking. “I run pretty well, I 
think. I’ll be able to go along with that pretty well.”
Murphy said he’s in the best shape of his life, and Yeg-
uete said he loves playing defense up and down the floor. 
All of Florida’s players seem to be on board, and that’s 
a good thing.

  For Florida’s volleyball team, there’s 
something about third sets. 
  The question of exactly why the third 
frame has been so kind to the Gators in 2011 
can garner mixed reactions. 
  “I’m not really sure why we do it, to be 
honest,” redshirt freshman libero Taylor Un-roe said. 
  What she’s referring to is a sense of domi-
nance the Gators have carried in three sets for much of this season. In 18 matches, Florida has lost the third set just twice — once in an eventual 3-1 win against Kentucky on Sept. 23 and another two days later in a ﬁ  ve-set loss to No. 20 Tennessee.
  No. 13 Florida (15-3, 8-1 Southeastern 
Conference) will try to keep that success go-ing tonight at 8 as it takes on South Carolina (10-9, 1-8 SEC) in an away game that will be televised live on ESPNU.
  “No matter how much preparation we do 
prior to a match — showing the players video and all — there’s nothing like when you’re on the court and you get into a rhythm,” coach Mary Wise said. 
  Third-set success has been most apparent 
for Florida in its last three victories, helping to extend the team’s current six-match win-ning streak. 
  Against LSU, Ole Miss and Alabama, Flor-
ida out-hit its opponents .403 to minus-.073 in 
the third set. The Gators have won the three 
sets by a total of 43 points. While the offense 
has certainly played a role, a large part of the credit goes to the  backcourt play of Unroe.  In the past three games, Unroe has re-
corded 43 digs. She picked up 21 in the three 
games before that. All six matches were 
straight-set victories.
  “The numbers say it,” Wise said. “What 
we see in Taylor is execution, but also I think 
there’s a different mindset.”
  After Unroe put an emphasis on raising 
her dig numbers a couple of weeks ago, Flor-
ida’s libero said she is pleased at her latest numbers but tends to be more critical when 
looking at herself.
  “It’s good to see numbers go up, but 
there’s still a lot more learning and improv-
ing I can do,” she said.
  Aside from Unroe’s play, Wise and play-
ers alike lean toward Florida’s combination of senior leadership and youth as to why third sets seem to be the Gators’ time for easy wins. Wise expects players to make appropri-ate adjustments during the ﬁ  rst two sets of the match.
  “Players with high volleyball IQ should 
be that way,” Wise said. “When you’ve got young players, you’re just hoping they’re in the right position.”
  But according to Unroe, the biggest key to 
third-set success might simply be the Gators’ recent penchant for quick wins. 
  “We feel like we have nothing to lose since 
we’re up 2-0,“ she said. “That’s a big comfort zone for us.” 16, ALLIGATOR   WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2011
