A Tent City resident awaits today’s eviction outside her tent after spending all day Wednesday preparing to leave. All Tent 
City residents must leave by 9 a.m.
By ROBERTA O. ROBERTS
Alligator Writer 
As of Wednesday night, the evicted residents of 
Tent City still have not been provided with an alter-
native place to stay.
Jayne Moraski, City of Gainesville/Alachua Coun-
ty Office on Homelessness director said the eviction 
came suddenly. She had no time to find a place for 
the 100 to 200 people who have to be 
out by 9 a.m. today, she said.
“We only had six days notice, and 
two were over the weekend. I can’t 
pull a miracle out of a hat,” she said.
Starting today, anyone found on the property will 
be arrested for trespassing.
 “If they don’t want them under parks and trees, 
then they should provide funding to organizations dealing with the homeless or build a place for them,” said Howard Simon, executive director of the Ameri-can Civil Liberties Union of Florida. 
“Don’t arrest them unless you provide a place for 
them to go,” Simon said.

A recent undergraduate survey 
successfully captured enough in-
put from students for UF officials to 
consider giving it again.
As of Monday, more than 
22,000 students have taken the Students’ Experience in the Re-search University (SERU) sur-vey, which gathers information on undergraduate campus life.        
The results of the survey, which has 
been given at other universities in 
the past but not UF, will help the university understand undergradu-ate academics, program reviews, students’ level of engagement and the student body’s interests on cam-pus, according to Marie Zeglen, the assistant provost and director of in-
stitutional planning and research.  
The University of California 
Berkeley Center, which created the 
survey, will gather the data and pro-vide UF with the results.
“The survey 
can be given 
three consecu-tive years, but 
we haven’t de-
cided if we will,”  Zeglen said. “Since the survey was given this year, we will ei-
ther give it again in 2010 or 2011, but we do not know when yet.”

$85,000 EACH YEAR.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
Starting Friday, UF students will no longer 
be able to pay for classes and other university 
expenses with cash or debit cards or make over-
the-counter payments to the University Cashier 
at Criser Hall.
UF expects to save $85,000 a year by eliminat-
ing the over-the-counter option, UF spokesman Steve Orlando wrote in an e-mail.
Other payment options, like online credit card 
transactions and e-checks, will remain available.
Payments can also be made by dropping checks in a 24-hour drop box outside the Univer-sity Cashier’s office or by mailing checks to UF.
The change won’t affect most students, as 
about 73 percent of payments are handled elec-tronically, Orlando said. The most popular pay-ment method is the online e-check, which is free, he said.
UF will still charge a fee for online credit card 
transactions, and Visa cards will still not be ac-cepted because the company charges a flat rate for transactions, as opposed to a percentage, he said.
UF prefers to pay a percentage fee because of 
the variety in payment sizes, Orlando said. Most of the remaining 27 percent of students who pay through the University Cashier use checks.
University departments that send their depos-
its to the cashier will not be affected by the new policy, according to a memo sent to administra-tors Tuesday.UF to deny cash, debit cards

WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal 
budget deficit soared to a record for May 
of $189.7 billion, pushing the tide of red ink close to $1 trillion with four months left in the budget year.
The rising deficit reflects increased gov-
ernment spending due to the recession, and billions of dollars spent on bailouts for banks and other troubled companies. The Treasury Department reported Wednesday that the red ink so far this year totals $991.9 billion. The administration is projecting the deficit for the budget year that began Oct. 1, will total an all-time record of $1.84 trillion, more than four times the amount of last year’s deficit.
Because of the recession, spending has 
increased for benefit programs such as un-employment compensation and food stamps. Outlays also have risen because of the $787 billion economic stimulus package that Presi-dent Barack Obama pushed through Con-gress earlier this year.

Gunman, guards exchange 
fire in Holocaust Museum
WASHINGTON (AP) — A 
gunman exchanged fire with se-
curity guards inside the U.S. Ho-locaust Memorial Museum on Wednesday.
U.S. Park Police Sgt. David 
Schlosser said the gunman walked into the museum with what he de-scribed as a “long gun.” The gun-man and a security guard were shot. Both were taken to the hospi-tal, but the extent of their injuries wasn’t immediately known.
U.S. Park Police initially gave 
slightly different information, say-ing three people had been shot. Fire department spokesman Alan Etter told CNN a third person was hurt after being cut by broken glass and bleeding.

� THE UPGRADE WILL USE 
$300K FROM SG RESERVES.
By SARA WATSON
Alligator Writer
With the first reading of two 
bills that passed Tuesday night, student Senators allocated a com-bined $360,000 for new student 
computers and a CSI-themed mu-
seum exhibit. 
Senators voted to pass a bill up-
grading the Student Government 
computer lab using $300,000 from 
SG reserves. 
Though it will undergo a sec-
ond reading, Student Body Trea-
surer Maryam Laguna empha-sized the importance of the bill, 
which would add 18 computers, 
eight of which are designated for 
quick printing and would time out after 10 minutes.
“During peak times, there’s al-
ways a line around the corner, so 
we’re just trying to give students 
a greater benefit for this lab,” La-guna said.
The bill was passed after Sen. 
Jason Yoepp amended it, adding 
that none of the $300,000 will be 
spent until the proposed layout 
has been approved by a fire mar-
shal. 
“Regardless of how we voted, 
we will be watching carefully to 
see to it that the money spent on the computer lab is spent wisely,” said Progress Party executive Nick Mildebrath in a press release.
Senators also passed a more 
controversial bill that allocated $60,000 to sponsor an upcoming exhibit at the Florida Museum of Natural History. 
The exhibit, “CSI: Crime Scene 
Insects,” focuses on the use of in-sects and insect life cycles to reveal crime scene details.
The money would allow stu-
dents free admission to the exhibit, 
which would otherwise cost $10 to 
$15, Sen. Lewis Curtwright said. 
However, the bill barely passed 
with a 32-25 
vote, as many 
senators were 
concerned with 
the cost and the number of stu-dents who can be expected to at-
tend.
“As of right now, I’m not sold 
on a bug exhibit,” Sen. Josh Rob-
erts said. 
The bill will undergo a second 
reading next week.
Press Secretary Eric Conrad 
spoke on behalf of Student Body President Jordan Johnson, inform-ing senators of a seatbelt law that 
will go into effect June 30. 
The new law makes not wearing 
a seatbelt a primary offense. Any 
person 18 or older can be charged, and drivers are responsible for passengers younger than 18. In a press release, Johnson said 
his administration is participating in a safety committee along with several Gainesville law enforce-
ment agencies to educate students 
on the importance of seatbelts.
“We’re trying to really target 
UF students, so we can make them 
safe and not affected by this $104 
ticket,” Conrad said. 
In addition to improvements to 
the SG computer lab, Roberts said 
he is working on attaining inex-
pensive, remote printing facilities.
The cost of printing is only 
about 1 1/2 cents per page, he said, 
but UF charges 10 1/2 cents.
“This is a huge issue pressing 
every student,” Roberts said. “I 
want to get it done over the sum-
mer, and my target area is the HUB.”
Vice President Larnell Vickers 
discussed his plan to enable stu-
dents to donate to the United Way 
using ISIS, and Inter-Residence Hall Association President Patricia Jordan spoke of a new UF-based 
television show focusing on life in 
dorms. 
“I’m really looking forward to 
the ‘Real World: Jennings,’” Sen-
ate President Audrey Goldman 
said, laughing.
Tuesday night also marked 
the approval of SG Productions 
Comptroller Ben Morrison and Graduate Senator Vikram Mu-nikoti Vasanth.lOcAlSG votes to upgrade computer lab

After a four-month delay, TV stations will no longer 
broadcast in analog starting Friday. Gainesville residents 
should be ready for the switch to digital broadcasting, 
said City of Gainesville spokesman Bob Woods.
The digital switch is old news for television viewers at 
this point, Woods said.
Devon Chestnut, public affairs specialist for Cox Cen-
tral Florida, said the change will not affect cable and sat-ellite TV customers, even if they have analog TV sets. In fact, the conversion should pass without notice for many, he said.
Chestnut said that TV sets made before 1998 might not 
have a built-in digital receiver and will require a convert-er box or subscription to a cable or satellite service.
Digital broadcasting provides improved pictures and 
sound quality and frees up airwaves for other types of 
communication, according to DTV.gov.
Some of the frequency spectrum made available by 
the switch will be auctioned to companies to provide ad-
vanced wireless services such as wireless broadband, ac-
cording to the Web site.
The switch, originally scheduled for Feb. 17, was de-
layed because many broadcasters did not prepare for the 
all-digital switch, and the 13 million people who still used analog televisions were unprepared, Chestnut said. Switch to digital

� 68 ASSASSINS REGISTERED TO PLAY.
By BRIANTI DOWNING
Alligator Contributing Writer
For the next three weeks, assassins will lurk out-
side classes and stake out homes in hopes of picking 
off another agent in the Gainesville Street Wars. 
These agents aren’t armed with pistols or rifles, 
but with water guns. Each student or Gainesville resident has another agent as a target. The competi-tion began Wednesday and two agents were already assassinated by 7 p.m.
Each agent receives a target’s name, picture, ad-
dress and workplace, along with a fun fact. When an agent is attacked with a water gun or water bal-loon, he or she is eliminated from the game and is 
required to give his or her target’s information to the 
assassin. 
Then the victorious assassin has a new target. Be-
fore the game began, each of the 68 registered agents paid $2. The sum goes to the person who kills the most participants.
Gainesville Street Wars was started by three 
friends, who modeled it after an internationally popular role-playing game called Assassin. Daniella 
Otálora, one of the founding members, discovered 
the game on a Web site.
“I linked the site to my friend James, and we 
were like, ‘Let’s organize it,’” Otálora said.This is the third round of the Gainesville Street 
Wars. The first was held in the summer of 2008 and had 40 participants.
Andy Lievertz, who is organizing this year’s 
War, wants to  hold another game in the winter. 
“It’s a very unusual sort of clandestine and ‘Mis-
sion Impossible’ game,” he said. “It’s not something we get to do every day.”
Participants take the game as seriously as assas-
sins do in the movies. During the fall game some-one told David Halford, the former runner-up, 
that his assassin planned to kill him at his house. Halford’s two roommates dressed in head-to-
toe scrubs, including scrub caps 
and surgical face masks. Halford then hid in his car, 
waiting for his assassin to arrive. 
The plan worked.The confused killer shot his roommates, thinking 
one of them was Halford and the other was a decoy. Halford then jumped out of his car and shot his as-sassin, which, according to the rules, did not allow her to pursue him for 24 hours.
The game includes a few wrong moves that 
could lead to elimination. Agents cannot be killed  in class, at work or in places of worship. 
Jorge Suarez, who won the fall game with three 
assassinations, said he is confident he will win this year, but he cannot reveal his methods. 
“I can’t discuss, but there’s definitely a new 
trick,” he said.Locals organize ‘street wars’

Permafrost is melting, and the 
number of new plants emerging 
from the ice isn’t enough to off-set the carbon, according to a 
recent UF study.
The study shows that Arctic 
greening, or the thawing of per-
mafrost, frozen layers of earth 
that are thawing due to climate 
change, is releasing more carbon than previous studies showed. 
When greenhouse gases are 
released from thawing ecosys-
tems, the temperature rises even 
more and leads to more thaw-ing, according to Ted Schuur, a UF associate professor of ecol-
ogy and the leader of the study.“The process is comparable 
to a slow motion time bomb,” 
Schuur said. 
Schuur’s research shows that 
the carbon is offset only initial-
ly, which dif-fers from pre-
vious studies. 
The only way 
to ease the damage is by burning less fossil fuel, he 
said.
“If those ecosystems are far 
from human influence start re-
leasing greenhouse gases as 
permafrost thaws, it will further 
contribute to changing the very nature of the planet we know everywhere,” he said.Study: Permafrost

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Legislation 
changing a health insurance billing proce-
dure, which drew support from doctors and opposition from consumer advocates and others, became law on Wednesday with Gov. 
Charlie Crist’s signature.
Crist also signed new laws prohibiting lo-
cal governments from spending public dollars 
to sway voters on ballot issues and closing a loophole that has let some corporations avoid taxes on real estate transactions. Another measure may make it more difficult for mu-seums to display preserved human bodies.
The health insurance law (SB 1122) will require insurers to send payments directly to out-of-network doctors instead of to patients.
Crist, the son of a doctor, wrote in a sign-
ing statement that some patients get insur-ance checks and then fail to pay their medical bills.
“For this reason, many providers are re-
luctant to care for out-of-network individu-als, thus reducing access to health care,” Crist wrote. “As a result, individuals may not get the opportunity to see the provider of their 
choice.”
He added that the new law also would re-
duce fraud.
A coalition including the Consumer Fed-
eration of the Southeast, Associated Indus-tries of Florida and the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees, 
had urged Crist to veto the bill.
They argued it could in-
crease out-of-pocket costs 
for patients and would re-move a key incentive for doctors to offer discounts for in-network services, leading to higher premi-
ums for everyone.
“If you have health in-
surance, this bill will cost 
you money,” said Walter Dartland, executive director of the Consumer Federation of the Southeast.The Florida Medical Association, though, 
praised the measure.
“While routing the payment through the 
patient may seem like a minor inconvenience, unfortunately, this practice is driving up the cost of health care, imposing hidden fees and limiting access,” said Timothy J. Stapleton, the association’s executive vice president.
The new law banning local governments 
from spending taxpayer dollars on political advertising (SB 216) was sponsored by Sen. 
Charlie Justice, D-St. Petersburg.
“Today marks a new era of government 
accountability, as this will ensure that gov-
ernment will not be telling taxpayers how to vote,” Justice said.

WELLINGTON, New Zea-
land — Palau agreed to accept 17 Chinese Muslims who have lan-guished in legal limbo at Guantan-amo Bay, indicating a resolution to 
one of the major obstacles to clos-
ing the U.S. prison camp.The announcement Wednesday 
by the Pacific archipelago, which 
would clear the last of the Uighurs 
from the camp in Cuba, was a major step toward the Obama ad-ministration’s goal of finding new homes for detainees who have been cleared of wrongdoing but cannot go home for fear of ill-treat-ment. The U.S. feared the minority Uighurs would be tortured or ex-
ecuted as Is-lamic separat-ists if returned to China, but 
the Obama administration faced fierce congressional opposition to allowing them on U.S. soil as free men. The men were captured in Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2001, 
but the Pentagon determined that 
they weren’t “enemy combat-ants.”
President Johnson Toribiong 
said the decision of Palau, one of a handful of countries that does not recognize China and maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan, was “a humanitarian gesture” in-
tended to help the detainees restart 
their lives. His archipelago, with a population of about 20,000, will ac-cept up to 17 of the detainees sub-ject to periodic review, Toribiong said in a statement released to The Associated Press.

For Rhode Island resi-
dents suffering from de-bilitating ailments, the 
sale of herbal relief may soon become legal thanks to legis-lative measures. 
The state Senate passed a 
bill on Tuesday by a margin of 30-2, which could allow for nonprofit stores to sell mari-juana to registered patients. According to a Boston Herald article, state law allows for the use of medical marijuana but not the sale.
There are three ways in 
which the bill can become a 
law. Gov. Donald L. Carcieri 
can sign off on the legisla-tion or refrain from making a decision within a week. Or, a three-fifths vote by both chambers can override a veto.
However, history suggests 
that the governor may be in-clined to veto the bill as a re-sult of his negative response to similar legislation put on his desk last year. Given the over-whelming support of the bill, evidenced by the margin in which the legislation passed, the governor may elect to take a progressive stance. 
Clearly, making marijuana 
legal for patients who may benefit from the herb’s potent effects could prevent them from dealing with criminals to obtain the drug. When a per-son suffers from glaucoma, he or she should not be worrying about getting arrested by a police officer to obtain some-
thing that may actually help 
him or her feel better. 
While the universal legal-
ization of marijuana may be years away, Rhode Island’s allowance for the sale of the drug at nonprofit stores would undoubtedly serve as a bold statement too loud to ignore.

Octogenarian kills guard 
at Holocaust Memorial
ColumnWednesday’s murder at the U.S. Holocaust Memo-
rial Museum serves as a bleak, if not sobering reminder of an astringent ideology fostered by 
hatred.
After security guard Steven Johns was shot to death by 
88-year-old James von Brunn, his colleagues subdued the suspect with gunfire, leaving von Brunn critically wounded. 
The attack took place just before 1 p.m. — a time at which 
the museum was nearing capacity with 2,000 visitors on the premises. Thanks to the fast response by two security offi-cers in remedying the situation, no one else was injured. 
According to a CNN.com article, von Brunn has been 
identified as an individual known to have strong anti-Se-mitic ties.
In addition to running a white supremacist Web site, 
von Brunn subscribes to the school of thought question-
ing whether Barack Obama is truly an American citizen 
and therefore should not be president. Clearly what we are dealing with is a man from a vastly different generation, struggling to stay relevant with a cowardly deed just two days prior to what would have been Anne Frank’s 80th 
birthday. 
While there is no underscoring the magnitude of even 
one person dying in vain, an even greater tragedy may have 
ensued if not for the wherewithal demonstrated by the two 
security guards at the scene.
Thoughtless actions like the one committed by von 
Brunn only serve to lessen whatever logically flawed argu-
ments members of hate groups attempt to make.
You probably missed the budding war between hu-mans and machines. 
Maybe you failed to notice because you were 
misusing the word “random” while uploading a Face-book photo album (no accepted definition of randomness includes “the same four people making the kissy face in different places”). You may have been too busy Twitter-

out now.” Thankfully, the pirates just saved your ass.
While the “Terminator” movie franchise has produced 
four films that define the law of diminishing returns, the core premise that humanity will be destroyed by robotic 
artificial intelligence is so close to reality that I can al-

only be Canada — and everybody knows that Canadians 
aren’t really people — but embracing Twitter with such zealous fervor obviously shows that we humans are so hard up for connections that we will sell our souls to the 
machines with little to no resistance.
Soon, you may have robot friends on Facebook. Re-
searchers in the United Arab Emirates have created a 
Facebook page for their robot. This sentient being, first named Sarah but later given the face of an old Muslim 
dude, recognizes faces and walks around in the UAE. 
Robots usually fail in their attempts to truly become “friends” with humans because they have nothing in common to talk about, but that’s about to end. 
The robot will automatically 
search for your face on Facebook when it meets you for the first time and be able to make real-time con-vo with you about that pool party 
where you made six different kissy 
faces. This old Muslim robot is pro-
grammed to be a Facebook stalker. It all seems sort of sil-ly, you may say. “It’s just robots on Facebook and Twitter Jesus. What’s the big deal?”
Enter the neurobot. As science has moved closer to 
mapping more of the human genetic code than was ever thought possible, robots have rolled in and taken that a few steps further. The Scripps Research Institute, in an 
article published last week, outlined how its brain bots 
have developed episodic and categorical memory never before found in robots. They learn from mazes and plot out places they previously visited, in addition to places they plan on going in the future — a feature the Nobel 
Prize-winning head scientist points out had only been 
seen in rats.
Like John Connor, the hero of the “Terminator” series 
who has been unsuccessfully hunted by robots for what 
seems like forever, some humans are willing to step up 
to the robots. The Pirate Party just won a seat in the Euro-pean Union elections held this week, and they are willing to fight for individuals and the dissemination of technol-ogy and information to everyone.
Also, pirates fighting robots is just plain cool.Tommy Maple is an international communications gradu-

Student Senators must improve attitude
As a senator from the College of Agri-
cultural and Life Sciences, I was personally 
offended and appalled at the demeanor pre-sented by the Orange and Blue party Sena-tors concerning Student Government’s bill in last Tuesday’s senate meeting. Such dis-respectful attitudes and comments directed toward my constituents by the Orange and Blue party have compelled me to write and inform the public of the situation.
On Tuesday, a bill (Senate bill 2009-1071) 
was presented to allocate to the Florida Mu-seum of Natural History $60,000 from SG funds to bring a new exhibit to the museum’s fall exhibition. Titled “Crime Scene Insects,” the exhibit covers the topic of forensic ento-mology and how insects help solve many of the country’s biggest crime scene mysteries. The exhibit appeals to the ever-popular CSI 
craze hitting the nation and is expected to 
draw more than 41,000 visitors to the muse-um. More importantly for my constituents, the exhibit is directly pertinent to many of the studies and areas of research that CALS incorporates as a college.
The $60,000 price tag buys free admission 
to the exhibit for all UF students. Further, 
the money will promise a return of adver-
tisement, in the form of more than 750,000 print impressions, 75,000 sight impressions via banners and signage and logo space on 
the museum’s Web site, which draws 16 mil-
lion visitors annually.
On the floor, the Orange and Blue Sena-
tors expressed such concerns as the exhibit 
being only applicable to a small portion of 
the student body and hinted that the num-
ber of students who would attend will be 
a frivolous percentage of the student body population. While these are in no way the exact words that were spoken, this is the 
general attitude I witnessed from the Or-
ange and Blue party, and I take personal is-sue with such a position.
My constituent college, CALS, is one of 
the largest colleges at UF. Further, CALS has 24 undergraduate majors, more than 50 areas of specialization and 20 graduate programs, and UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences has extension offices in each of Florida’s 67 counties. We stand as 
a flagship in the areas of food, agriculture, 
natural resources and life sciences. To write 
off the pertinence of the exhibit to the stu-dent body as anything less than significant is, in itself, a great travesty.
I stand to defend the interests of my con-
stituents by supporting Student Senate bill 2009-1071.

U.S. journalists should serve sentence
The two American journalists who were 
recently sentenced to 12 years in a hard la-bor camp in North Korea are facing a stiff penalty for their actions. 
I know this will place me in the vast mi-
nority, but I believe North Korea should stand by its actions in this case and not re-lease the two women. Now, I know that one of them has a 4-year-old daughter and one has an unreleased medical condition. Per-haps my opinion would change if it were my own mother, but the fact remains that they knowingly broke the law by illegally enter-ing North Korea and possibly committing other unreleased crimes. 
If a foreigner breaks the law against the 
United States, do we just release them back to their home country with no punishment?  Odds are they end up facing an even harsher judicial process than American citizens.
By trying to convince North Korea to re-
lease these two women, the United States serves only to propagate the idea that we think we are better than everyone else and shouldn’t be punished for breaking other nations’ laws. 
Whether the sentence seems too harsh 
to us here in America does not make a dif-ference. The fact remains they consciously 
broke North Korean law. Thus, they should 
be subject to the North Korean juducial sys-tem and serve the sentence.

Thanks to the recent downturn, the U.S. economy is often 
defined in purely mathematical and financial terms. 
The nearly 2.6 million jobs lost in 2008, the 1,100 
dealerships closed by General Motors Corp. and the 9.4 
percent unemployment rate in the month of May are all nu-
merical markers for this recession. However, among the de-
pressing numbers and figures there is also a heartbreaking 
human element to the story that has its own chapter here in Gainesville. 
I recently went down to the St. Francis House, a home-
less shelter on South Main Street, for a class assignment and 
was confronted by my own ideas and perceptions about this 
recession. I had seen homeless men and women before, but somewhat shamefully, this was the first time I talked to these 
people and discovered their life stories. One man attributed 
his misfortune to a loss of momentum, like a rolling ball com-
ing to a stop. 
Another man refused to talk to me, ashamed of the posi-
tion fate had put him in. One thing that became clear to me as I 
talked to these people was that this latest economic downturn has a human element that should not be 
ignored and should be at the center of all efforts to fix the economy. While the government is providing bailout funds 
to companies, many of the homeless in America still go un-noticed. 
This ignorance of the homeless has been present for years 
and, unfortunately, has not been addressed or reversed. The stereotype of the homeless as smelly, dirty people in rags 
is far from the truth, especially for those at St. Francis. The 
men, women and children at the shelter are seeking an end 
to their troubles. They are the people who need help from the 
Gainesville community. 
While at the St. Francis House, I talked to several workers 
who are on the front lines trying to help. What I learned is that it is easy, especially for UF students, to get involved. Whether 
volunteering through a student organization, working with 
the UF Center for Leadership and Service or simply going down to the St. Francis House, UF students have several ways 
to get involved with this effort. It is very important, if only for altruistic benefits, that stu-
dents and the greater Gainesville community get involved to 
help the more than 1,000 homeless men, women and children who call Gainesville’s streets home. The picture of the overall 
economy that is portrayed on the news and in other forms of 
media seems almost unreal at times. With U.S. debt spiraling 
into trillions of dollars and millions of people losing their jobs, 
it is extremely difficult sometimes to get your head around the figures. 
However, it is very important for people to get involved 
with helping the homeless locally in a time when the situa-
tion for so many people is turning dire. Anna Edwards, a case 
manager I talked to at St. Francis, put it best when describing the problems the homeless face in this economy.
“Before, when the economy was better, there was a success 
story every two weeks here,” she said. “Now, nobody in here 
can get a job.”
How’s that for making your qualms about a lack of beer 
money sound totally insignificant?

A 62-year-old Gainesville 
resident was taken to the hospi-
tal early Wednesday after jump-ing from a window to escape a fire in a two-story townhouse. It 
was the second Gainesville com-
plex to catch fire in a month.
At about 2 a.m., Gainesville 
Fire Rescue responded to the Tower Oaks neighborhood, 1817 SW 69th Terrace, to find the townhouse engulfed in flames.
Nathaniel Long was taken to 
Shands at UF after jumping from 
his second-story window. Other 
residents, including a 15-year-old, were unharmed when they evacuated the apartment.
Because the townhouse was 
destroyed and deemed unliv-able, the American Red Cross was called to assist the residents in finding a place to stay until they can be permanently relo-cated, an Alachua County Fire Rescue release stated.
Although it was a two-
apartment build-ing, the second townhouse was unaffected by the 
fire, ACFR spokeswoman Carol Davis said.
Davis said it is unclear if the 
townhouse had working smoke alarms at the time the fire start-
ed.
Although an inspector from 
the State Fire Marshal’s Office 
was at the scene Wednesday morning, the cause is still un-known and under investiga-tion.

A new screening system devel-
oped and tested at UF will give 
the green light for cleanliness.
HyGreen, a sensor that works 
much like a breathalyzer, uses re-sidual scent to determine whether 
a doctor’s or nurse’s hands are clean.
“The most important thing 
you can get people to do is wash 
their hands just before you touch 
a patient and just after,” said Dr. Nikolaus Gravenstein, an anes-
thesiologist who helped develop 
HyGreen. “And what you realize 
is that’s a heroic number of hand 
washes.”
The HyGreen system monitors 
workers, flashing green if workers’ hands are clean and vibrating like a restaurant buzzer if their hands need washing, Gravenstein said. Each employee will wear an elec-
tronic HyGreen badge that flashes 
green when activated by sensors placed in a patient’s room, keep-ing constant record of a hospital 
worker’s hand-washing habits.
“It will naturally motivate 
them,” Gravenstein said.  “We all 
perform better if people are keep-
ing score.”
The product, which took eight 
months to develop and is cur-rently in its first round of clinical testing at the intensive care unit at 
Shands at UF, is the newest way 
hospitals can fight to keep costs 
down, said Dr. Richard Melker, 
who worked with Gravenstein to develop the product. 
Because of new mandates that 
prohibit Medicare and Medicaid from footing the bill for mishaps called “never events,” which in-clude blunders such as operating on the wrong patient, the financial 
burden will fall on the hospital. 
“The majority are related to hos-pital-acquired infections,” Melker said, noting that private insurance companies will most likely follow 
suit.
Melker said he thinks hospi-
tals will initially implement the 
HyGreen system in high-risk ar-
eas such as the ICU or transplant 
facilities where patients’ immune systems are compromised. How-ever, once hospitals see how ef-fective the HyGreen system is, 
they will likely require it, he said. 
Patients will also be able to deter-mine the cleanliness of the staff, by monitors above their beds that will display a reading, Graven-
stein said.
“It’s hard in a doctor-patient 
relationship to be asking the doc-tors if they’re really washing their 
hands,” he said. “[With] this sys-
tem, they’ll know automatically: 
clean is green.”uf ReSeAR ch

to the homeless with the One-Stop 
Homeless Center project, which is an estimated 18 to 24 months away from completion.
On June 4, at a City Commission 
meeting lasting more than eight hours, Commissioner Jack Dono-van suggested that people think of 
the homeless, and Tent City resi-
dents in particular, as refugees and urged the city to provide immedi-ate assistance. 
He shared a story of how Mexico 
City built a place for the refugees of a countryside famine to live. 
“They didn’t condemn them,” 
he said in the meeting. “It wasn’t a 
great place to live. It was a horrible 
place to live, but it was a place to live.” 
Donovan asked commission-
ers to consider having city staff as-sess the possibility of moving the evicted residents of Tent City to a former public piece of land that was 
vacated two years ago. 
His motion included turning 
the land into a temporary campsite 
with safe water and a bulldozed road system for easier access for a police presence. 
Donovan wanted city staff to 
do a “down-and-dirty” analysis of the level of soil contamination 
and report back within two to four 
weeks.
“We aren’t going to have any-
thing else for 18 months, and that’s a long time,” he said.
No other commissioner agreed 
with Donovan.
Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan said 
the long and complicated zoning 
problem concerned her. 
City Manager Russ Blackburn 
said most of the land is a closed 
landfill site and he doesn’t know what is under the ground. He also didn’t know how much it would cost or how long it would take to 
find out.
“As difficult as it may be to say 
let’s keep focusing on that bigger 
picture future, I urge the commis-sion to keep our resources focused [on the One-Stop Center],” he said.
According to city spokesman 
Bob Woods, the City of Gainesville has a tentative contract to build the center on 63 acres of land located in the 800 block of Northwest 53rd Avenue. 
 “This is not just a city problem. 
This is a community-wide problem. That is why we are working in part-nership with Alachua County for 
the One-Stop Center.”
In regards to the eviction, “our 
intent tomorrow [9 a.m. June 11] is 
to enforce applicable ‘no trespass-ing’ laws and to provide informa-tion to those who request assis-tance,” Woods said.
“Is that enough? Probably not. 
But the City recognizes that, and 
that’s why we’re working on a long-
term solution,” Woods said.
Moraski, however, said she 
wishes the city had worked on a short-term solution.
 “Our shelter system is over ca-
pacity,” Moraski said. “I can’t find a place for them.”
Arupa Freeman, a founder of 
HomeVan, a homeless-aid orga-nization, said the city created this “horrendous situation” by not tak-ing responsibility.
“In my time, if someone was sick or hungry we did something now. We didn’t form a committee for five 
or 10 years,” she said. 
HomeVan volunteers and com-
munity members went to Tent City 
Tuesday and Wednesday mornings to help some residents move their things to other locations.
According to Freeman, “a bunch 
of them got together and a rented storage unit using their disability 
checks, but a lot of them are just go-
ing to lose everything.”
Freeman had some advice for 
those working on the homeless is-sue in Gainesville:
“I think when you oppress peo-
ple and fear people and isolate peo-ple, you are creating hell, and when you love people and include people 
and take care of people, you’re cre-
ating heaven,” Freeman said.
“Maybe this community needs 
to decide whether they are creating hell or heaven.”
One-Stop Homeless Center won’t be completed for 18 to 24 months

ipate in the survey, which is a great success,” 
said Jeanna Mastrodicasa, assistant vice presi-dent for student affairs. 
Although the survey was required in order 
to enter the football lottery, Zeglen said more 
than just football fans took the survey, and the 
breakdown will be available in the fall.
The last day to take the survey is July 31, and students can take it online at ISIS.
Zeglen said the survey lasts 20 to 25 min-
utes. It consists of multiple-choice scaled questions that ask the extent of the student’s agreement with the question. Five questions ask the student for a written response. 
The survey also asks questions about the 
student’s political engagement, study abroad experiences, attendance to campus events and engagement in campus activities, Zeglen said. 
“These questions show how a student 
turned into a Gator,” Zeglen said. 
One drawback is that students 
will take the survey a couple of times, which can become repeti-tive and redundant, he said. 
“We don’t have data yet, so results are 
still speculative, but I feel that the survey will give the data to improve departments of the university and help the campus as a whole,” Zeglen said. 
Elizabeth Andrews, a junior photojournal-
ism student, said she felt the survey would help the university with undergraduate pro-grams. 
“The questions asked on the survey were 
in depth and made me really think about my university experience from the past year,” she said.Results from survey may help improve university’s departments, campus

Ricky Klopfenstein / AlligatorIn a music scene littered with 
bands that sound and dress alike, 
Philadelphia experimental rockers mewithoutYou have made a name for themselves, straying from the 
norms of today’s doomed “emo” 
culture.   
Whether it involves going to col-
lege, living in submission to God or Dumpster diving, mewithoutYou isn’t your typical indie band. The guys in mewithoutYou have mas-tered the craft of multi-tasking.      Rather than spend their days 
rubbing elbows with label reps and 
spamming MySpace pages, they balance being in a Billboard Top 200 band while pursuing a variety of ventures outside of music. 
While his band mates are en-
rolled at Villanova University and teaching at inner-city schools in Philadelphia, front man Aaron 
Weiss is busy attending classes at 
the University of Pennsylvania. 
Weiss’ mother works at UPenn, 
and this connection allowed him to enroll as a student during the 2008-2009 school year.
”I was just taking a few classes 
this past year. I’m not in any pro-gram. I’m not sure if I’ll ever get a 
degree out of it, but it has been re-
ally nice to take classes,” he said. 
Going back to school wasn’t a 
dream or an aspiration for Weiss. 
He began to attend classes after 
a friend advised him that he spoke 
to God in a prayer. In his prayers, 
Weiss’ friend found that it might be good for the band’s front man to go to school and have something other than music to spend his time on, while opening up another ca-reer option, Weiss said.
 “It was done in submission to 
God, not something I wanted to do,” he said.
Weiss’ spirituality makes him 
a natural fit as the front man of a band whose lyrics and messages are heavily influenced by the reli-
gious teachings found in scripture. 
“During my clearer moments 
I realize that I don’t really have 
anything else except for God,” he said. “I have a family and a band and friends and ideas and beliefs and religious groups and all these things, but all of those things are going to be gone very, very soon. 
Even my own body, it’s all passing 
away.”
With lyrics taken from Scripture 
and a new album title taken directly from a holy man —”It’s All Crazy! 
It’s All False! It’s All a Dream! It’s Alright” is a quote from a holy man named Bawa Mu-
haiyaddeen, who came 
to Philadelphia in the early 1970s 
— mewithoutYou have carved a niche for themselves delivering God’s messages. 
MewithoutYou’s message 
speaks to many young adults who constantly struggle to balance classes, exams, job searches and the 
list goes on. 
“There is a lot of loneliness and 
confusion and fear so if you want 
to get drunk, I can relate. But pay attention,” Weiss said. “Watch closely to what happens to your 
own heart when you do those 
things.”
But Weiss does not want to push 
religion down the throats of the band’s fans.Weiss wants people to live their lives in a way that brings contentment. 
“If there are other things to do 
and you want to do them, then do them,” he said. “But pay attention. Learn from it and move forward. Don’t cling to it just because that’s what everyone around you is do-ing.” 
With their fourth release, the 
band uses an acoustic guitar to 
present a newfound maturity. 
Fans of the quartet’s first three 
records may be shocked when they 
first listen to the band’s latest al-bum. 
Weiss’ signature raucous vocal 
style has been replaced by a mel-lowed-out, melodic one. 
The biting guitar riffs that me-
withoutYou’s fans are accustomed to have been replaced by simple chord progressions and acoustic rhythms.
After guitarist Christopher 
Kleinberg left the band to pursue a career as a doctor, Weiss began to rethink the band’s musical style.
The result is a Dylan-esque, 
folk-influenced musical backdrop that presents an ideal medium for Weiss to showcase his softer, grown-up side. 
“We like the new songs better,” 
he said. “Why not make music that you like, rather than music that you liked when you were 22? We’ve all changed.”
And changed they have. Weiss 
has put his life into perspective this past year, straying from the holistic lifestyle he once led to get more in touch with those around him.
”I used to make a big deal of 
what I do and don’t do,” he said. 
Weiss points out that he used 
to be more judgmental, thinking that everyone who didn’t eat out of trash cans, had a cell phone, drove instead of biking and didn’t shop exclusively at thrift stores was wrong. 
 “It was just so crazy for me to 
obsess over myself in that way. It didn’t bring me peace, and I was tired of feeling so separated from everybody because of all these 
things I did and didn’t do.” 
MewithoutYou’s front man has 
found that it’s much sweeter to 
leave judgments to God.  
“Nothing I ever do or don’t do 
will make me better than anyone else,” he said. 
While on tour, rationing food 
and money is essential. 
Through the years, the band has 
learned to “Dumpster dive” as a means of snagging a free meal.
”You would be amazed that 
you can find enough food that oth-ers have thrown away if you know where to look,” Weiss said.12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 2009

TourTHURSDAY, JUNE 11, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 13
For four UF students, winning a 
national title has nothing to do with 
touchdowns or free throws. Their task is a much more difficult one — making people laugh. 
A group of four UF stand-up come-
dians will represent the university at the finals of the National College Comedy Competition of the Rooftop Comedy Fes-tival in Aspen, Colo. 
The team, composed of UF students 
Calvin Cole, Lane Pieschel, Rudy Men-doza, and Tim Keck, survived five rounds of competitions judged by live and on-line audiences to become one of the final 
four, out of 32 college teams seeking to be 
crowned the nation’s “Funniest Comedy Team.”
UF’s team will go up against the Uni-
versity of Minnesota’s team tonight at 11 p.m., EST, when each team’s comedians will perform five-minute comedy sets. 
The performances will stream live 
on RooftopComedy.com, where online viewers can vote for their favorite team up to 30 minutes after the final perfor-mance.Votes cast online and by the live audience will determine the round’s win-ner, which will face-off at a final round on Saturday. 
Pieschel, a recent UF graduate with 
a degree in English, won the competi-
tion’s regional semi-finals in 2008, when 
individual comedians — not teams — 
competed. He feels confident about his team’s chances. Although, he jokes, a 45-year-old woman on Minnesota’s team might give him some trouble.
”As long as we don’t overthink things 
and do the best we can, I think we’ll be all right,” Pieschel said. “I doubt any of these other teams are really amping it up.” With a national title on their minds, 
the four prepared for the mountain showdown by borrowing a strategy from Urban Meyer’s playbook — watching videos of their opponents. 
Here, their competitive nature re-
vealed itself. While watching a video of a competing student’s routine from an earlier round, the UF team laughed after a joke fell flat. 
Weak responses to jokes are common 
for any stand-up co-median — especially the four on UF’s team, who perform 
regularly at the Coconuts Comedy Club in Gainesville in front of audiences that are at times unresponsive. 
Cole, a film studies senior, believes 
his teammates’ shared performing expe-rience (four to five shows a week) gives them a competitive advantage over the other teams.
“We work together all the time,” he 
said. “We best represent the spirit of the competition.” 
The UF team reflects a wide range 
of experience. While Pieschel has per-formed for nearly three years, Keck’s de-but was for the competition’s qualifying round last February. The comedians like to poke fun at Keck’s “freshman” status 
on the team.
”When we get to Aspen, Tim will just 
stay in the hotel,” Pieschel joked. 
Cole jumped in with a comment about 
the team’s desire to win.
”We’re all pretty deserving,” he said. 
“Well, not Tim.”
Keck doesn’t mind. The telecommu-
nications junior had always feared being 
on stage by himself, but he was hooked 
after his first show.
”It was the first time I did something I knew I wanted to keep doing,” he said. 
Like Keck, Cole was an early bloomer. 
In fall 2007, he started taking classes and 
performing at Coconuts, where he re-ceived warm receptions from audiences.Cole remembers when a stranger ap-
proached him and complimented him on 
a joke, which the stranger had tried un-successfully to retell to his friends. Cole considers it the best compliment he’s ever received.
”When you’re a comedian, the joke is 
yours from beginning to end,” he said. “This guy tried to steal it, and it didn’t work. But he tried.” 
Mendoza, an engineering junior, had 
a slower start than the other three. He de-scribed the audience reaction to his debut performance in the Reitz Union in Febru-ary 2008 as “five minutes of silence.” 
“The first six months were really 
bad,” Mendoza said. “I kept wondering, ‘Am I good enough?’ and ‘Am I funny 
enough?’” 
As he continued to write jokes, how-
ever, Mendoza gained confidence and 
performed in the second round of last year’s competition. Eventually he was asked to headline a show at Coconuts, in which he had to deal with rude audience members. 
“At one point I just told them to shut 
the fuck up,” he said. “The audience cheered, and I ended strong.”
Mendoza feels his struggles have pre-
pared him for a victory in Aspen. 
The four comedians look forward 
to proving themselves and having their hard work noticed. 
“It’s not just having a good time,” Cole 
said. “It’s a lot of work and a real payoff. But all the rewards are yours. You’re con-
vincing the world one step at a time that 
you deserve to be listened to.”

GainesvilleHUNTER SIZEMORE AND BRITTANY DAVIS  � AVENUE WRITERS
ERIK VOSS � AVENUE WRITERPeople lounged in multi-col-
ored hammocks strung between 
oak and pine trees, sucking on bowls, sipping over-priced beer and nodding their heads to a reg-gae beat.
Closer to the stage, mud-
covered fans packed a clearing, shouting “No Woman, No Cry” along with a Bob Marley stand-in, backed by The Wailers.  
The performance was the clos-
ing act of the four-day Wanee Fest held in Live Oak Thursday through Sunday about an hour north of Gainesville. 
The festival included clas-
sic rock acts such as The Allman Brothers Band and The Doobie Brothers in addition to the south-
ern-styled Drive-by Truckers, reg-
gae legends The Wailers and nu-
merous funk and jam bands, such 
as Ivan Neville’s Dumpstaphunk and The Derek Trucks Band.
As early as Thursday, haggard 
hippies, country folk and music 
junkies scoured the 700-acre Spirit 
of the Suwanee Music Park for the perfect place to unpack their 
tents or motor homes and warmly 
greet their new neighbors. Many 
brought guitars, Hula-Hoops and 
Frisbees.The clouds and wind kept the 
crowds cool, and afternoon thun-
dershowers turned the dirt field in front of the main stage into a sandal-sucking bog. 
People took off their shoes or 
slowly picked their way through the mud to get to stands selling beer, ice cream, chicken on a stick and fried pickles.
To a live soundtrack of Doo-
bie Brothers’ hits such as “Listen to the Music” and “Long Train Running,” two teenagers played Frisbee, sliding in for catches like baseball runners on home.
“I’ve gotta rinse off a little bit. 
At least rinse off in the river,” said Tanner Dafoe, gesturing to his once-white shorts and baseball 
cap. 
Musicians jammed all day Fri-
day and Saturday, with sets start-
ing at noon and leading up to The Allman Brothers Band prime time 
performances from 9 p.m. to mid-
night on both nights. 
The double performance was 
billed as a celebration of the band’s 40th anniversary.
Two festival-goers said they 
trekked from New Jersey to see 
The Allman Brothers Band.
“I saw them one time inside of a stadium, and I didn’t enjoy it as 
much,” Mark Joyce said.
Joyce said he was reserving 
his dance moves for The Allman Brother’s performance that was scheduled later that day.
The Derek Trucks Band capped 
Friday with a midnight to 2 a.m. performance and The Wailers fol-lowed suit on Saturday. 
The shows took place at the 
Mushroom Stage, an amphithe-ater worked into the forest with over 60 hammocks replacing sta-dium seating. 
Pink and green ribbon chande-
liers and strings of lights passed through branches over the amphi-theater’s dirt dance floor.
Festival organizers said this 
year’s Wanee attracted more people than ever before, although 
they didn’t share exact numbers.
Brittany Mennen, a UF busi-
ness marketing graduate, who 
wore a blue poncho dotted with 
orange gator logos, said this was 
her fourth visit to Wanee, and 
crowds were the largest she’s ever seen. 
She has also attended Langera-
do and Bonnaroo.  
“Festivals are really picking 
up,” Mennen said. 
In an age of smart phones and motion-con-
trolled consoles, it might not be long before the 
use of 15-pound textbooks becomes obsolete. 
Michele Crump, the emerging technologies 
librarian at UF, is researching ways UF’s libraries 
can make the use of electronic readers available 
to students. She has been testing a Sony Reader Digital Book and is awaiting the arrival of the 
latest generation Amazon Kindle.
Libraries at other schools, such 
as North Carolina State University, have electronic readers available for student use. 
Crump said electronic readers were the wave 
of the future, and “we just need to move there as fast as we can.”
 Using the technology, students can down-
load content onto the reader as opposed to print-ing it out. In terms of sustainability, moving away from paper should be a goal, she said. 
Since Crump has just started testing the read-
ers, UF has no concrete plans as to which device will be purchased or how they will be used in 
the libraries.
However, Amazon.com has taken steps to 
lure students into using its newest edition to the 
Kindle product line  — the Kindle DX .
The Kindle DX, which is designed with text-
books and newspapers in mind, was unveiled in early May and is scheduled to begin shipping this summer with a $489 price tag.

I have a thing for office supplies. 
Pens, highlighters and staplers put 
me in a mood that makes it nearly 
impossible to get work done. 
I think it began during my years 
in Catholic school — a time when we were forced to wear dull uniforms and avoid physical expression. Our only hope of individuality was our choice of school supplies. 
Instead of “Inspi(red)” T-shirts 
and Abercrombie jeans, we had ne-on-colored rulers and Elmer’s spar-kle glue. I scribbled love notes with my Yikes! pencil to the girl with the sexy Lion King lunch box.
Returning to school every fall 
meant reinventing my image. I’d linger for hours in the Target office supplies aisle, wondering, “Which 
brand of pencil sharpener did Greg 
recommend?” and “Would Ashley want to borrow this glue stick?” 
(Ten years later I’m doing the 
same thing in the pharmacy aisle.) 
I’d come home and unload the 
haul on my bed like it was Hallow-een candy. The smell of a freshly opened stack of wide-ruled paper 
was intoxicating to a kid who wore 
the same boring white polo and navy blue slacks every day.
By sixth grade, Uniball pens were 
popular — the guys appreciated the bold, phallic shape and the ladies the smooth, generous flow.Naturally, our preferences devel-
oped along with our anatomies. 
When I transferred to a public 
high school, most students preferred practicality to aesthetics when it came to school supplies, and fash-ion took over as the dominant social identifier. 
I would hear from friends in 
Catholic high school that they iden-
tified “losers” as those who let their 
backpacks sag over their rear-ends. Apparently, it had some connection to prison gang-rape rituals. 
But in public high school, a back-
pack was just a backpack. Instead, my “loser” status was revealed by my clean haircut and jean shorts. Meanwhile, the fetish remained - to 
me, few sounds were sexier than the 
snap of a three-ring-binder.
Since entering college, my tastes 
have matured. I no longer judge a woman by the color of her milk pen but by more reasonable factors such as hair scent and “bangability.” 
But it doesn’t surprise me that I 
still fantasize about cluttered office 
desks and cramped storage rooms.
“Don’t bother moving the ma-
nila folders,” I whisper to Pam from 
“The Office” as we straddle the fax machine. “Your hair smells great, by the way.” 
I suppose I’ll always have trouble 
saying “sticky notes” with a straight face.Snazzy school supplies 
help set students apart
ERIK VOSS  � AVENUE WRITERThe hot, summer sun and cloudless skies 
are the perfect combination for sundresses and 
baring some skin. Shorts, mini dresses and sheer fabrics can either make the summer a three-month fashion show under the sun or a nightmare. 
Local Gainesville designers have created 
seasonal looks that are functional and unique to their specific styles. 
Weightless summer
Nava Ottenberg, owner of Persona Vintage 
Clothing and designer of Sleepwalk, a line inspired by vintage lingerie and sleepwear, is keeping her line romantic this season with sheer, lacy details and materials.
”I’m always into silks, nylons, soft cottons 
and rayon. Right now, I’m into see-through,” said Ottenberg. “I dye my fabric — I take dif-ferent things and put them together.” 
Ottenberg’s jewelry and hand-painted 
pieces feature a bird motif, representative of the idea of free flow and movement that she likes to give her dresses. Most pieces are ‘try-on size,’ meaning that they are designed to fit most body types.
”The dresses are shells, and it’s fulfilling 
to see dresses take life and take mold on the body,” she said. 
This summer, the Sleepwalk dresses are 
shorter, cut lower and have open backs. 
“My dresses are sexy, so a lot of younger 
girls wear them layered,” said Ottenberg. “My stuff is always new, it’s very cohesive and rec-ognizable, but you can always expect the soft-ness of the material.”
For the fall, Ottenberg is looking forward 
to designing with soft flannels, a feeling which she described as having been washed the per-fect amount of times. Inspiration for the next season will come when the weather changes. 
“I make clothes so that people can come in, 
buy it, walk out and wear it,”  Ottenberg said. “I’m not influenced by occasional trends.
LoKally inspired
Local women’s wear designer Bobby K 
based his summer collection, full of bikinis, short skirts and mini dresses, on a Brazilian inspiration of safari and military proportions 
composed of brown, khaki, maroon and olive tones. 
Bobby Kelley, recog-
nized as ‘Bobby K,’ bases his design choices on women’s opinions. 
As a man designing for women, Kelley likes 
to make pieces that women will enjoy wear-ing. 
“If a girl wears my dresses, I want her to be 
the center of attention,” he said. 
Inspiration comes to Bobby K through his 
surroundings – something from the news, mu-sic or people he meets. The energy from meet-ing a new person can inspire him to create. 
Kelley also keeps up with fashion maga-
zines and watches runway shows because as much as he likes to be creative, he also wants to be marketable to his audience. 
His fall collection will be a mix of retro punk 
and safari motifs. His designs for the season, he 
said are ‘going ‘80s, going grunge’ and are all 
about embellishment and dying techniques. 
“The entire collection will be based on the 
notion of a girl from the next millennium that is super sexy, super chic, modern, sophisticat-ed.”Designers turn to short cuts 
and breezy fabrics for summer

UF coaches Kevin O’Sullivan (base-
ball) and Tim Walton (softball) might as 
well have slapped hands this past week.
Similar to a wrestling tag-team duo, 
one (Walton) heads out of the ring of 
success while the other (O’Sullivan) en-
ters.
Maybe it’s not a fair comparison — 
the softball team is only 13 years old 
compared to the 98-year-old baseball 
program — but in the last 11 years, 
when college baseball and softball have each had three NCAA Tournament tiers 
(Regionals, Super Regionals and World 
Series), the UF squads have reached the 
Super Regionals in the same year only 
one time.
This year.And if only 
one is going to 
make that leap 
over the next few 
years, fans should 
plan to spend 
a lot of time at 
McKethan Stadi-
um, home of the 
baseball team.
Expectations 
do have some impact on such a perspec-tive, but the facts are just as supportive.
UF baseball and softball saw their 
seasons end recently. Both had a twinge 
of disappointment. The feelings were 
quite different, however.
UF PLAYERS TAKEN IN 2009 MLB DRAFT CORNELIUS INGRAM SIGNS UF GOLFER QUALIFIES FOR US OPENIt’s all about perspective.
While Phil is correct that the baseball 
team’s future is brighter than it has been 
in quite some time, mostly thanks to the 
coaching of Kevin O’Sullivan, the soft-ball team has already become a nation-ally recognized powerhouse.
The loss in the championship series 
to Washington was definitely a disap-pointment, especially for a team that entered the year with its sights set on nothing less than a national champion-ship, but that’s not the last time this team 
will play in Oklahoma City.
O’Sullivan is in the process of re-
building a perennially successful base-
ball program here at UF, but he’s about 
two years behind coach Tim Walton. 
Like the baseball team in 2009, the soft-ball team fell in the Super Re-gionals in 2007. 
The next year, 
the Gators made it to the World Series, which O ’ S u l l i v a n ’ s 
team has a 
strong chance of doing in 2010. 
As Phil said, 
a lot of our perspective has to do with the 
expectations each team faced. Winning a 
Regional made the baseball team’s sea-son an instant success, while a runner-up trophy turned a record-setting 63-5 By JESSICA ETTER

Gray Horn made UF history yet again Wednes-
day at the NCAA Championships in Fayetteville, 
Ark.
The freshman finished the first day of the de-
cathlon in 10th place with a score of 3,973 points, a new day-one decathlon freshman record for the Gators.
Horn’s five events on Wednesday included the 
100m dash, shot put, long jump, high jump and 
400m. 
Today, Horn will participate in the remaining 
events beginning at 2:30 p.m.: the 110m hurdles, 
discus, pole vault, javelin and 1500m.
“This is something I’ve dreamed about for my 
entire life,” Horn said following his win at the Southeastern Conference Championships in May.
Horn was not the only Gator to find success on 
the first day of the championships, although some 
of the evening events were disrupted by severe 
weather.
The meet was delayed due to thunderstorms 
and lightning for about three hours on Thursday 
evening. The NCAA Championships resumed 
around 11 p.m. to finish the men’s and women’s 3000m steeplechase preliminaries as well as the men’s and women’s 5000m preliminaries. 
UF coach Mike Holloway was not available for 
comment by press time due to the late finish of 
Wednesday’s events.
Beau Burroughs and Kemal Mesic will partici-
pate in the finals of the men’s shot put at 7:15 p.m.  
today. Burroughs finished in 10th place during the preliminary round Wednesday afternoon with a throw of 60-3.25/18.37m and Mesic finished in third place with a toss of 63-1.50/19.24m.
From the No. 14 women’s track and field team, 
Mariam Kevkhishvili and Keely Medeiros ad-vanced in the women’s shot put. 
Kevkhishvili, ranked No. 1 in the nation for 
the event, was an automatic qualifier for the final 
round at 5:45 p.m. today.
Senior Carlos Phillips finished eighth in the 
men’s 800m with a time of 1:49.65 and will com-
pete in the finals for that event on Saturday.
The No. 1 men’s 4x100m relay team finished in 
second during the preliminary round on Wednes-day with a time of 38.57 seconds. 
The team consisting of Dennis Martin, Calvin 
Smith, Terrell Wilks and Jeremy Hall will run in 
the finals on Friday.
“We are focused on winning,” junior sprinter 
Calvin Smith said before leaving for Fayetteville. 
“If we win then we will be No. 1 at the end of the season and that is what matters.”
The second day of events begins when Horn 
competes in the second day of the decathlon. 
UF’s  participation in the running events are 
scheduled to begin at 5:50 p.m. with William Wynne and Kalinka Pitt competing in the men’s 100m hurdles. 
The championships will continue through Sat-
urday. CBS will air the NCAA Championships’ final events on Friday and Saturday. These events are scheduled to air live on CBS College Sports 
from 7-10 p.m. on Friday and live on CBS Satur-
day from 1-3 p.m.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The idea was for 
Phil Mickelson to try to return to a routine 
after his world was shaken with fear.
It has been three turbulent weeks since 
he announced his wife, Amy, was diagnosed with breast cancer.
Mickelson has always felt like he was in 
control, even if his golf at times suggested otherwise. Now, he feels helpless.
“I’ve never been this emotional, where if 
I’m driving alone or what have you, I’ll just start crying,” he said Wednesday at the St. Jude Classic, his eyes tinged with streaks of pink, his voice no longer steady and sure.
“We’re scared, yeah,” he said. “I think a 
lot of it is the unknown.”
Tests on his 38-year-old wife have pro-
vided enough optimism 
that surgery has been 
pushed back to early July, 
allowing Mickelson to re-
turn to competition this 
week before going to the 
U.S. Open in New York, where he is beloved under 
normal circumstances.
His wife faces treatment for at least a 
year, so they decided to do what they nor-mally would — play golf tournaments, take 
their three children to camps and activities. 
They plan to take a tropical vacation after 
the U.S. Open and before Amy’s surgery.
Even so, this was not a normal routine for 
Mickelson in Memphis.
Some 300 fans lined the walkway at the 
bottom of the stairs leading to the clubhouse 
where he ate, waiting for autographs or pic-
tures, some wearing pink shirts in support.
Mickelson, however, went around the 
front of the clubhouse to avoid the crowd, 
setting up shop at the far end of the range 
that had been reserved for the amateurs be-
fore his pro-am round. Woody Austin, his partner at the Presidents Cup last time, and defending champion Justin Leonard walked 
over to welcome him back with a handshake 
that turned into a hug.
He does not know what to expect from 
his game. 
Mickelson said he would hit balls for an 
hour while his wife was resting, and he feels 
he is not far off from earlier this year, when 
he won at Riviera and Doral.
“But certainly, I haven’t played in a 
while,” he said. “I had an emotional month, 
and I don’t know where I will be on the golf 
course as far as being able to focus. I don’t 
know that yet.”Mickelson ready to make emotional return at U.S. OpenTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — Mike 
Krzyzewski’s decision on his 
future as USA Basketball na-tional team coach is expected to come next month.
Krzyzewski and USA Bas-
ketball chairman Jerry Col-angelo discussed the job over dinner this week. Colangelo previously had said he expect-ed to name a coach in the fall.
USA Basketball spokesman 
Craig Miller said Wednesday that the two men agreed a coaching decision would come before the Americans’ mini-camp for young players from July 22-25 in Las Vegas.
Krzyzewski likely wouldn’t 
coach at the minicamp, but he might be there looking at play-ers who could someday wear USA uniforms for him.
“By the time we have our 
event in mid-July, I think a lot of things will be put forward at that time,” Krzyzewski said. “By mid-July, I think it’ll all be out there.”
Colangelo would like 
Krzyzewski to return but doesn’t want the coach to rush into a decision. The Ameri-cans don’t play this summer, so they have time.
Krzyzewski coached the 
U.S. team the last three years, leading it to the Olympic gold medal after a third-place fin-ish in the 2006 world champi-onships. The Americans’ next competition is the 2010 worlds in Turkey.
If Krzyzewski opts not to 
return, New York Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni, an assistant the last three years, is a leading candidate to replace him. If he does come back, Krzyzewski could be joined by the core of his Olympic champions. Col-angelo said during a meeting in February with Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Chris Bosh that the play-ers said they would be open to returning next summer and in the 2012 London Games.
The Americans will bring 
in about 24 players, includ-ing Kevin Durant and Derrick Rose, to the July minicamp to identify players who could fill whatever spots are available in 2010.

ORLANDO — Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
doesn’t see much of a future for Dwight 
Howard in all those rim-rocking dunks and power moves from the Orlando Magic center.
The NBA’s career scoring leader 
would like to see Howard rely less on his size and athleticism and make him-self a player his team can turn to when it counts. Maybe even throw in a skyhook or two.
“He’s still offensively kind of raw,” 
Abdul-Jabbar said Wednesday. “He doesn’t have a go-to move yet. Right now, he’s kind of predictable.”
The NBA Finals have shown that 
Howard has a long way to go to be the dominant offensive center the Lakers’ Hall of Famer was. The Magic trail Los Angeles 2-1 with Game 4 on Thursday.
So far, Howard’s Superman act has 
mostly been grounded.
“Kareem is right, and he understands 
that in order to be a good player you have to add different things to your game,” Howard said. “I’ve tried to do the skyhook just like him, but he had more range and more touch. He was shooting skyhooks from the 3-point line, and I’m still working on it from the paint, so I’ve got a long way to go.”
The Lakers have tested Howard’s 
skills perhaps more than any team in the playoffs and exposed his still-devel-oping fundamentals. They’ve harassed him with double-teams, surrounded him with 7-footers and shrunk his pass-ing lanes.
The constant different looks have eased the pressure on the Lakers’ front-court.
“So far, it hasn’t been all that bad,” 
Lakers forward Pau Gasol said about guarding Howard.
Abdul-Jabbar is waiting for How-ard’s offense to match his defense.
“Dwight is kind of limited offensive-
ly,” he said. “He does great right under the basket, you force him to do other things, he doesn’t have an answer for it yet. But I think that’s his challenge.”26, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 2009
Kareem calls Howard predictable
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — Lakers coach Phil Jackson 
delayed watching the entire tape of Game 3, 
preferring a few hours of sleep over reliving the misery of Tuesday night.
When his players finally watched the film 
Wednesday morning of their 108-104 loss to the Orlando Magic, something immediately jumped out at them.
“The final score,” guard Derek Fisher 
said.
Something else, too. A series of defensive 
lapses, mostly minor, some bigger, but all correctable.
“There were some little things defensive-
ly, which every time you watch film, even 
when you win, there’s just always some things you see that you can do better,” Fisher said. “So there were just small things ... a rota-tion off here or there, de-fensively letting guys get back to the middle when 
we try to keep everything out of the middle.”
The Lakers better do something quickly 
to address those. They started to show some slippage on the defensive end in the second half of Game 2, then played some of the worst defense in NBA Finals history Tuesday night.
Orlando shot 75 percent in the first half and 
63 percent for the game, both finals records. All-Stars Dwight Howard and Rashard Lew-is each scored 21 points and Hedo Turkoglu had 18, but Jackson seemed more concerned with the way the Lakers covered Rafer Alston (20) and Mickael Pietrus (18), who had strug-gled in the first two games.
“We have to defend those guys,” Jackson 
said. “I thought that we were playing a little 
bit lax.”Lakers need

T 
     WASHINGTON — Relaxation is on 
Stephen Strasburg’s agenda for the sum-mer. History, apparently, is not.
Asked about the spotty success of past 
No. 1 draft picks the latest to claim that mantle said Wednesday he’s not inclined 
to learn from other people’s mistakes.
“I’m sorry, but what would I learn 
from other top picks?” Strasburg said in 
a conference call with reporters. “Obvi-ously, I watch guys that have made it to the big leagues. I don’t plan on being the top pick and then not being successful in the big leagues.
“I obviously want to take my game 
to the next level and I believe that I’ve learned how to work hard in college, and I hope to carry that over.”
The mega-hyped right-hander from 
San Diego State was selected Tuesday by the mega-bad Washington Nation-als. Now comes a summer of negotiation and relaxation. The player will be the one doing the relaxing, while agent Scott 
Boras and the Nationals work out what is 
expected to be a record-setting contract.
“There’s obviously a few places I’d 
like to go, and just relax this summer and have fun,” said Strasburg, who spent last summer playing in the Olympics and just completed his college season with the Az-tecs. “It’ll be good to have a little rest time, especially after the big workload I had the previous year. It’ll be a good summer to be able to lift and get stronger and have the summer I haven’t had in a while.”
Strasburg said he hasn’t followed the 
Nationals and hasn’t visited the nation’s capital since he was a kid. That might be for the best, given the team’s worst-in-majors 15-41 record headed into Wednes-
day’s game against the Cincinnati Reds.
Boras, meanwhile, made it clear where 
his client stands headed into the contract 
talks. He put Strasburg in the category of “a different breed of cat,” belonging in the one percent of the draft class that is low risk and worthy of big payoffs.
“An extraordinary player receiving a 
substantial bonus far above other draft 
picks has happened before ... Obviously 
Stephen falls into that class of players,” Boras said. “They just happen to have that extraordinary ability.”
Boras wouldn’t give numbers, but he’s 
expected to ask for a package worth sev-eral times the value of the current high-water mark of $10.5 million that Mark Prior received in 2001. The Nationals have 
started their counteroffensive, saying 
they’re not going to throw out baseball’s salary structure for one player and that the expectations surrounding Strasburg have reached unrealistic proportions.
The Nationals, however, are hardly in 
a good bargaining position. They forfeited the pitcher they chose No. 9 overall a year ago — Aaron Crow — when they 
couldn’t get him signed by the Aug. 15 
deadline.THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 27

The baseball team finally exorcised its Mi-
ami demons, advancing out of a NCAA Re-
gional that contained the Hurricanes for the 
first time in 11 tries. The Gators were promptly 
swept by Cinderella stand-in Southern Miss, 
which didn’t even know if it would make the NCAA Tournament.
The softball team entered the Women’s 
College World Series as a three-loss No. 1 seed 
for the second straight year and with the expe-
rience of 2008 expected to put the Gators over 
the hump in 2009. UF proceeded to watch its 
best pitcher ever lose her edge and be swept by Washington in the WCWS championships 
series.
Despite each team being swept in a three-
game series, these events were seen through 
much different lenses. Yes, the teams were at 
different levels of play and the closer a team 
gets to a championship, the more bitter the 
disappointment.
The true answer, if it hasn’t already been 
hinted at enough and you couldn’t guess, is 
expectations.
The UF softball team rightfully set its sights 
on a national title and nothing less. There was debate among the alligatorSports staff about 
whether or not the team would have more or 
less than its five losses of 2008. Turns out we 
were all wrong — it was a push.
Now consider the baseball team for a sec-
ond. Only one writer predicted the Gators 
would even reach the Super Regionals, and 
he was mercilessly mocked.
Don’t expect similar expectations in the 
years to come.
It’s all about window of opportunity, and 
the baseball team’s just opened while the soft-ball team just saw its shut.
The baseball team loses at least five players 
in 2010 — a starting left fielder (Avery Barnes), 
a backup catcher (Teddy Foster), one decent right-handed pitcher (Patrick Keating), one 
pretty good lefty (Stephen Locke) and a great 
story in a sixth-year starting third baseman (Brandon McArthur). Relief pitchers Tony Davis and Billy Bullock, both juniors, as well 
as center fielder Matt den Dekker were taken 
in the MLB Draft and will decide whether or 
not to return to Gainesville.
Not only did UF finally defeat Miami in the 
Regionals, but O’Sullivan showed he could 
lead a winning postseason team sweeping the 
Regional after opening his time in Gainesville 
with a 1-6 postseason record. The Southern 
Miss sweep drops him to 4-9, and the home 
losses do hurt, but the Golden Eagles were a 
hot team and the Gators’ shaky young pitch-
ing couldn’t be expected to have a second 
straight dominant weekend.
As for softball, the Gators lose seven 
players, including four key starters (Ali Gar-
diner, Kristina Hilberth, Stacey Nelson, Kim Waleszonia). The most important of these, of 
course, being Nelson who leaves Gainesville 
holding basically every UF pitching record. 
Walton admitted Nelson might be one of 
the best players he ever coached, and he’s 
only in his fourth year at UF. He has also said 
he doesn’t plan on anyone else wearing Nel-son’s No. 42, an appropriate gesture for a great 
player, but one that nonetheless brings focus 
to the point that UF had to win this year. 
Rising junior and next year’s No. 1 pitcher 
Stephanie Brombacher may be great, but it’s 
unfair to expect anyone to be the next Nelson.
Some recent history on the diamond in 
Gainesville doesn’t speak well either for Wal-
ton, who just wrapped up his fourth season in 2009. 
In 2005, a fourth-year baseball coach (Pat 
McMahon) led a team returning many play-
ers from UF’s first trip to Super Regionals in 
2004. That 2005 baseball team earned a No. 
7 national seed and made it all the way to 
the College World Series before being swept 
by Texas in the finals. UF missed the NCAA 
Tournament in 2006 and 2007, and McMahon was promptly fired.
Then, O’Sullivan took over as leader of the 
baseball team.
Now, he might be taking over the post of 
having the most successful UF team on a dia-
mond.softball season into a disappointment. 
But recent history has shown that UF 
baseball doesn’t exactly live up to expecta-
tions either. After making the College World 
Series championship series in 2005, the 
Gators started the 2006 season ranked No. 1 but finished .500 and didn’t even make a Regional.
Don’t expect a similar performance by the 
2010 softball team.
With Stacey Nelson in the circle, 2009 
may have been the Gators’ best chance at a national championship, but they will be back 
in the WCWS — possibly even in 2010.
Walton will miss the talented senior class 
that played just as much of a role in building 
the program as he did — Nelson and Kim Waleszonia set record after record in their 
four years at UF. 
However, Walton did something that I’m 
not convinced the baseball team has done 
yet: establish a deep recruiting base outside 
of Florida.
Out-of-state players on the baseball team 
are exceptions to the rule, while Walton has 
filled his roster with players from California, arguably the state with the most softball tal-
ent. Take a look at the new recruits for next 
season: two players from California, two from Florida and one from Texas.
The Gators have brought in a large re-
cruiting class every other year recently, and I expect Walton to continue that tradition. 
He did so with the Class of 2011, which 
will likely be remembered as the most ac-
complished group to ever play in Katie Seas-
hole Pressly Stadium by the time they leave.
It wasn’t just about one particular class or 
two great years for the softball team. It was about developing a dynasty and building 
upon previous accomplishments to take the 
next step.
Although I think the baseball team will 
be in Omaha for the CWS next year, I feel much more certain that the softball team will 
become a mainstay in the WCWS for years to come.
It’s easy to say the Gators won’t be suc-
cessful after losing Nelson, Waleszonia, Kris-tina Hilberth and Ali Gardiner, but keep in 
mind the success this year’s baseball team 
and the 2008 softball team had with lower 
expectations. 
And it’s not like the Gators will have to 
completely rebuild next year.
The team got along fine without Waleszo-
nia when she missed most of the season 
with an injury, and the Gators showed their depth and versatility at the plate during her absence. 
UF will miss Hilberth’s leadership more 
than her ability to slap-hit the ball practically wherever she wanted to, as hitting won’t be an issue for the 2010 Gators. 
Eight of the team’s top 10 batters will re-
turn next year, and Tiffany DeFelice, who dealt with an on-again-off-again wrist injury all season, is far more capable than her num-bers in 2009 might suggest. 
Stephanie Brombacher likely won’t be as 
dominant as Nelson was during her junior year, but she won’t need to be with her of-fense pushing runs across the plate.
UF also led the Southeastern Conference 
to softball prominence over the last two years. A few teams — notably Tennessee when Monica Abbott was pitching — have 
found success, but 2009 was the best year the 
SEC ever had, as the conference put three teams in the final four of the WCWS. 
In a sport absolutely dominated by the 
Pac-10, that’s no small task. But many other 
SEC teams followed in UF’s footsteps of re-
cruiting talent from the west coast and pulled the conference into a virtual dead heat with the Pac-10 this season — with UF leading the 
pack.
So although O’Sullivan had a successful 
year and has brought the UF baseball pro-
gram back into the national spotlight along with the potential for an even better effort 
next year, he’s going to have to share the 
limelight with Walton and the softball team. Don’t expect either set of Gators on the dia-mond to go anywhere anytime soon.ADAM , from page 24 PHIL , from page 2428, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 2009
