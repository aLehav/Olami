A white bike chained to a fence begs passers-by not to 
drink and drive.
The family of Rebecca Harris, a UF student killed July 
11, 2012 in a hit and run, installed a ghost bike at the 
intersection of Southwest 16th Avenue and Archer Road for the anniversary of her death.
“We wanted to try and ﬁ  nd a way to balance the 
brightness and joy with also a thought that people would think about drinking and driving,” said her father, 48-year-old James Harris. “Maybe students who pass by the ghost bike will see it and think about its purpose.”
Ghost bikes are small somber memorials for bicyclists 
killed or hit on the street. A bicycle is painted entirely white and locked to a street sign near the crash site to serve as a reminder of the tragedy and as a quiet statement in support of cyclists’ rights to safe travel.
James Harris and his family decided to bring ghost 
bikes to Gainesville and felt it would be the ideal way to remember their “Becca.”

Shark Week hoo-ha-ha.
The millennial generation was raised 
watching shark-friendly movies like “Find-ing Nemo” and “Shark Tale,” but there’s one annual series that forces students to de-lay their Summer B studying for obsessive television watching — Discovery Channel’s Shark Week.
Cox Media consultant Raul Martinez said 
trends show the Gainesville ratings parallel or exceed the national show ratings.
“We know that Shark Week gets a lot of 
viewership,” Martinez said.
But for George Burgess, the director of 
the program for shark research at the Flor-ida Museum of Natural History, the value 
of sharks extends far beyond the entertain-
ment in Shark Week.
“A shark is a topic of great interest to the 
public,” Burgess said, “a natural phenom-enon that we can’t control, like hurricanes and lightning.”
Burgess has been featured on Shark Week 
regularly and said he hopes to see a lot more education during the week’s shows. But he 
said he knows the over-the-top circumstanc-es portrayed by the show are what interest 
UF students. 
“It’s the thought process of dying in the 
mouth of an animal or being eaten,” he said.
UF entrepreneurship master’s student 
Jeffrey Kaplan, 27, said he is terriﬁ  ed of sharks, but that’s not why he chooses to 
watch Shark Week.
“It’s almost like a cultural event,” he 
said. “I tune into Shark Week because of all 
the hype and marketing around it.”
Discovery Channel’s character-driven ap-
proach with Shark Week 2013 has created a larger opportunity for audience interaction.

the Shark” appeared on Shark Week’s “Shark After Dark” talk show series Sun-Seal the deal: Shark Week bitesSEE BIKE, PAGE 4

The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity 
house on West University Avenue is 
undergoing about $120,000 in renova-tions this summer.
The changes, which are being fund-
ed by alumni donations, are part of a ﬁ  ve-year construction plan.
“We’re replacing the major support 
beams out in the front of the house that support the foyer roof,” said 19-year-old David Corbin, the fraternity’s house manager. “They are the original beams, and after 50 years, they’re basi-cally rotted through.”
In addition, loft beds were built in 
some of the bedrooms, and the kitchen is being replaced. The pillars in the front of the house are being repainted as well.
“We want to keep this house going 
strong as long as possible because the bones are still good,” Corbin said.
The beams should be done before 
Fall starts, and the kitchen is due to be ﬁ  nished in November.
“It’s deﬁ  nitely needed these renova-
tions for a while,” said UF engineering sophomore John D’Amore, 19. “The contractors have been pretty speedy with the work so it hasn’t been too in-convenient.”
Corbin, a UF telecommunication 
and political science sophomore, said the fraternity hopes to install more loft beds and wood ﬂ  oors next summer.
“Pike was the ﬁ  rst fraternity house 
at UF,” Corbin said. “When it was built, it was a masterpiece. Now, it’s struggling to hang in there.”Off-campus Pike house

Francis Bacon’s brushes among oddities in auction 
LONDON — Art lovers who 
can’t afford a painting by Francis 
Bacon can bid on the late artist’s 
paint brushes at an auction of un-usual items.
The eight brushes — given by 
Bacon to fellow artist Clive Barker 
in 1978 — are in a paint-splattered 
butter bean tin inside a clear box. They have an estimated price of 20,000-25,000 pounds ($31,000 to 
$46,000).
Bacon’s paintings have sold for 
as much as $86 million at auction.
Also among the 150 lots in 
Christie’s Out of the Ordinary sale: a rocking horse as tall as a house; a 
flying machine from Steven Spiel-
berg’s “Young Sherlock Holmes”; a stuffed ostrich; and a Triceratops skull valued at between 150,000 
pounds and 250,000 pounds.kicked off three years ago. But 
the name was changed after the International Olympic Commit-
tee came after him, telling him 
he couldn’t brand his event as an 
Olympic event.
That still doesn’t sit well with 
Brooks because he doesn’t think 
anyone should own the rights to 
a word.
“The word was around before 
they were around,” he said, point-
ing to the Olympics’ origins in 
ancient Greece. “If they want to 
complain, then they should have 
the Greeks call and tell me to stop using it.”
Rare foul flower spreads stench at Calif. college 
SANTA BARBARA, Calif.  — 
The corpse flower has come alive.
The huge, rare and famous-
ly putrid Indonesian flower is blooming for one day Wednes-day, spreading its stench across the University of California, Santa 
Barbara.
The university said in a state-
ment that the flower “smells like 
a cross between rotting flesh and 
Limburger cheese,” and the green-
house where it’s unfurling its blos-
som is open to members of the 
public who want to take a whiff.
The flower uses flies instead of 
bees to spread its sticky pollen. It produces two sulfurous chemicals 
within its leaves that the flies find 
attractive.
The plant at UCSB is 4 feet tall 
and growing fast.
Arizona boy digging for worms 
finds a handgun 
PRESCOTT, Ariz.  — A 9-year-
old boy digging for worms in northern Arizona found a gun buried near his home.
Police in Prescott say the stain-
less-steel .38-caliber revolver was in plastic bag along with one bul-let just under the ground’s sur-face.
Police say it appears the gun 
was only covered up to hide it until someone came back to get it.
They say they don’t know who 
owns the gun or how it ended up buried near the home of the boy who found it Monday.
Police didn’t identify the boy.
 
Authorities say the gun’s serial 
number has been checked and 
it’s not reported missing.

Pa. sideburns contest celebrates 
1813 battle hero 
ERIE, Pa. — A sideburns con-
test honoring a U.S. Navy com-modore known for his impres-sive facial hair is marking the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Lake Erie.
The Erie-Times News reports 
that the winner of the Perry Burns contest will be named this week. Judges will decide who sports the sideburns most like those of Oliver Hazard Perry, who de-feated British forces in Septem-ber 1813. He is considered a War of 1812 hero.
Historical portraits suggest 
that Perry wore long mutton-chop sideburns that extended toward his lips.
Erie residents say the town 
had a beard-growing contest marking the battle’s 150th anni-
versary in 1963.
Participant Kevin Kantz says 
he’s been growing out his side-
burns since July. He says he was 
inspired by the 1963 contest, 
which he attended at age 11.
Former Redneck Olympics under 
way in Maine 
HEBRON, Maine — Despite 
being forced to changes its name, the event formerly known as the Redneck Olympic Games continued its tradition Saturday of holding unorthodox compe-titions like lawn mower races, mud runs and tire burnouts.
A full day of events was on 
tap during the Maine Redneck “Blank” Games. Organizer Har-old Brooks changed the name under pressure from the Inter-national Olympics Committee, but noted that “everyone knows what the ‘blank’ stands for.”
Friday’s events included a 
wedding and a demolition der-by. Other events over the week-end included bobbing for pigs’ feet, toilet seat horseshoes and a greased watermelon relay race.
The idea behind the event, 
Brooks said, was to have what amounts to a great big outdoor picnic and pig roast for hard-working people who’ve earned the right to blow off some steam.
Being a redneck, he said, isn’t 
about living in a trailer, or get-ting drunk.
“A redneck is someone who 
works hard. They say their neck is red because they work outside. A redneck can make fun of him-self and have a good time,” said Brooks, who’s a general contrac-tor.

A UF environmental horticulture 
professor has developed an orange 
plant for the Gator Nation. 
Dave Clark created Gator Glory, a 
coleus plant with a gold band around 
orange leaves. He said the band sym-
bolizes the color used for agricultural academic regalia.
Clark teaches Plants, Gardening 
and You, a UF introductory course that includes lectures on coleus breed-ing. The idea for the orange plant originated in that course — one of Clark’s students suggested creating 
an orange coleus plant.
“It took us about four years,” he 
said.
Clark said Gator Glory symbolizes 
the teaching and research at UF and 
the Institute of Plant Innovation of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sci-ences.
“It’s a terrific thing when research 
talent and school spirit come togeth-er,” said UF spokesman Steve Or-lando.
Clark said the university doesn’t 
have an official plant. Gator Glory grows well in Florida’s warm weath-er, he said, but it is not available to purchase. 
UF agricultural operations man-
agement senior Rebecca Lee, 23, said it would be “really neat if the Gator Glory became UF’s official plant.” 
“It is another way to represent the 
college in a beautiful manner,” she said. 
Clark said his goal was to have 
Gator Glory displayed on the UF commencement stage. Gator Glory 
was displayed at the 2013 spring com-
mencement ceremony, and there are plans to display the orange plant at the summer and fall ceremonies as well, he said.
“I’ve seen Gator Glory in front of 
the stage at commencement ceremo-nies, and it’s a nice accent,” Orlando said. “I’m sure there are lots of Gators out there who will be waiting to snap them up.”

Amid the bustle of people coming and going from UF 
Health Shands Children’s Hospital’s atrium Thursday, child 
patients chased and danced around toy robots fashioned from 
Lego kits and small motors.
The children were charged with selecting their favorite 
among three teams of robots. Their votes were cast in plastic 
buckets with Lego bricks matching the colors of the teams’ 
tables as part of a UF College of Engineering student competi-tion.
UF mechanical engineering professor Dan Dickrell said 
the teams were composed of freshmen taking an introductory 
engineering design and programming course.
He said as their final project in the course, students were 
broken into teams and tasked with designing an interactive robot that incorporated some form of art and mimicked life. Only three of 30 designs were chosen to compete at Thurs-
day’s second annual competition after they were whittled down by an expert panel of judges: two 6-year-olds.
“We wanted the students to kind of meet the end user of 
the products they’ll be making,” Dickrell said.
Among those deemed worthy were Dr. Hoot, a robot re-
sembling an owl that spins its head when it hears loud noises, 
and Cheeta, a robot built to mirror its namesake with an at-
tached hand crank that moves its legs.
Opposing these two teams was a conglomerate of robots 
from the yellow team: Rouge, a ladybug that was grounded 
due to technical difficulties; Beau, a snail that slithered along 
while peering out of its shell with two googly eyes; and the 
team’s flagship robot, Sparkle, a butterfly that flapped glitter-
covered wings as it wandered carelessly across the atrium 
floor.
Nine-year-old patient Anna Rose said Sparkle was her fa-
vorite.
“I like it because it’s beautiful,” she said through her breath-
ing mask, which was decorated with Disney characters.
But 5-year-old Valerie Miranda, who came with her moth-
er to the hospital to visit her brother, said she liked all of the 
robots.
“The coolest one is the tiger one,” she said, pointing to 
Cheeta.
Shele Green, unit assistant at pediatric intensive care, said 
events like the competition are important for the children.
“Things like this that bring the normal back into our pa-
tients’ lives are wonderful,” Green said.
She said Sparkle “rocked” the competition.Calm fell over the atrium as each child cast his or her Lego 
vote and left with parents and caretakers, taking their laugh-ter and heavy footsteps with them.
The red, yellow and blue Legos were tallied.In a landslide victory, the yellow team’s Sparkle — and its 
compatriots Beau and Rouge — won the title of the children’s favorite robot. 
Yellow team programmer Nick Guarcello, an 18-year-old 
UF mechanical engineering freshman, said the competition was stiff, but he felt his team’s designs were better than the 
other teams.’
“When we built the robots, I thought, ‘This came out of 
pieces, and now the kids are playing with it and enjoying it,’” Guarcello said.Child patients play

Student Body President Christina Bonarrigo and her ad-
ministration — Vice President Joselyn Rivas and Treasurer 
Jayce Victor — celebrated 100 days in office last week.
“They’ve been amazing,” Bonarrigo said. “We’ve had 
great results, and we’ve gotten a lot accomplished this 
summer so far.”
Bonarrigo said she’s been focusing on Student Gov-
ernment’s increased transparency and accountability. She maintains a blog, www.studentbodyprezuf.blogspot.com, and a Twitter account, @UF_SBPrez.
Bonarrigo has also been hosting lunch events. About 50 
students came to the first one, and about 150 people came 
to the second.
“We’re really making sure that students see what their 
elected officials are doing,” she said.Rivas echoed that sentiment. She said the cabinets will 
host multiple events during the Fall so they’re visible on 
campus, and she hopes students will attend.
In addition, Rivas said she’s overseen the creation of 
three new cabinets — Veterans Affairs, Interfaith Affairs and Innovation Academy Affairs — to better serve the stu-dent population.
Victor was unavailable for comment, but Bonarrigo 
said he’s been working on the DocuTraq activity request system so it’s easier to use.
In the next 100 days, Bonarrigo and her administration 
will work on finding funding for Newell Hall’s renovation and developing a blue light mobile app.SBP marks Bon-hundred days in office

Gainesville will once again make its way 
onto the big screen in “Paperback,” the second 
feature film by UF alumnus Adam Bowers.
The romantic comedy will be set in 
Gainesville, and shooting will begin in Sep-
tember.
Bowers’ first film, “New Low,” was select-
ed to show at the 2010 Sundance Film Festi-val and was also set and shot in Gainesville, 
on a budget of $2,000.  To prevent working on a shoestring again, Bowers launched a fund-raising campaign via www.kickstarter.com, which will end Aug. 16.
“I’m really excited to make a movie that 
isn’t hindered by its lack of budget,” Bowers said. “I think the overall quality in every as-pect will be so much better.”
Once the movie is finished, Bowers said 
he hopes to have it premiere at a major movie festival and to make it avail-able online through Netflix or Hulu.
Bowers plans to feature 
Gainesville area locations like Satchel’s Pizza, Palomi-
no Pool Hall, Video Rodeo 
and Ichetucknee Springs in 
the scenes.
“When I made my first 
movie, I really wanted to try to capture my life when I was living in Gainesville and going to UF and working in the town,” Bowers said. “That’s what I’m hoping to recapture.”
Roger Beebe, owner of Video Rodeo and a 
UF associate professor of film and media stud-ies, recently became a producer of the film. 
Beebe said Bowers gives his movies a unique 
location, instead of the generic landscape of many indie films.
“I think it’s a great ambassador for 
Gainesville,” he said.UF alumnus plans second indie movie starring Gainesville

With the goals of pedestrian safety and im-
proved traffic flow in mind, the city launched 
a trial traffic pattern near Westside Recreation Center on Sunday. 
The City of Gainesville Public Works De-
partment cut the number of traffic lanes from four to two. The changes affect Northwest Eighth Avenue from Northwest 23rd Street to Northwest 31st Drive.
John Veilleux, the project’s manager, said 
the experiment kicks off a four-month trial pe-riod through the Fall which includes adding on-street bike lanes between Northwest 23rd Street and Northwest 31st Drive. The informa-
tion gathered from the trial period will inform 
city commission discussion about whether to make the change permanent. 
“We are trying to make the right decision 
and try to give everyone’s opinions consid-eration,” Veilleux said. “There are a lot of school zones in the northwest, and we want to be careful and not jump into a decision. We want to make a safe corridor along Eighth Av-enue.”
Last year, Veilleux said, workshops pre-
viewing the project drew mixed feedback.
If Eighth Avenue’s evaluation is successful, 
the reconstruction of Northwest Eighth Av-enue is scheduled to start in 2015.
Some residents are continuing to express 
concern about the reconstruction project. Alan Taylor, a local bicyclist, said changes other than altering traffic lanes are in order, such as addressing speeding.
“I’m not keen on being on the road with cars 
because of the way they drive,” Taylor said. 
“They need to offer an artery for bicyclists,” 
Taylor said. “The bike lane is a short stretch and starts only in the test section. What good are bicycle lanes for the test stretch when there are none east or west of the test section?”
In an email to the Gainesville City Com-
mission, resident Stephen Figueroa said nar-rowing the road is a poor choice, and he ques-tioned the effectiveness of the reconstruction 
project.
“It’s ... hard to see why a test is being done 
in the quiet summer rather than the busier 
school year, especially since the changes im-pact a school zone,” Figueroa wrote.City tries new traffic pattern to improve flow, aid pedestrians

Downtown businesses 
are getting ready to get their 
Gator on at United Way’s 
themed tailgate event series.
Four “Get Your Gator 
On!” street parties are slated 
for this year, and the themes 
will include health and fit-
ness, rock ‘n’ roll, local art and Gainesville spirit, orga-nization representatives an-nounced last week.
Kim Faenza, director of 
communications and market-ing for United Way of North Central Florida, said the Fri-day night events act as a pep 
rally before home games.“It’s a reason to start the 
celebration early,” she said. 
“We’re a unique little town and we’re just celebrating that.”
Brandon Nappy, Swamp 
Head Brewery marketing di-rector, said that by providing a beer garden for the event, the company is helping unite 
the downtown area.
“This seemed like the 
perfect opportunity to align 
with them and to promote downtown Gainesville,” he 
said. 
Diego Ibanez, owner of 
Emiliano’s Cafe and presi-
dent of the Gainesville 
Downtown Owners and Ten-
ants, said the street party atmosphere will showcase downtown to visitors.
“They come in for games 
and we want to show them there’s a lot more to Gainesville,” he said.
“We have a tight commu-
nity here of businesses … that 
complement each other.” Downtown tailgate

Gainesville has topped the 
charts again.
The city was recently listed as 
the No. 3 college town by lifestyle 
website www.livability.com.
The ranking was based on cri-
teria including weather, enter-
tainment, nature and business in-
novation, said Matt Carmichael, the editor of Livability.
The percentage of residents 
between ages 25 and 34 also fac-
tored into the ranking, he said, 
because those statistics show a town can retain students after they graduate.The university’s presence in 
Gainesville creates both an econ-omy center and a cultural center, Carmichael said.
UF is one of the largest em-
ployers in the city, he said, and it draws speakers, concerts and other entertainment.
Karla Aguayo, a 20-year-old 
anthropology junior, said she thinks Gainesville made the list because it is a versatile communi-ty with a diverse student popula-tion. It also has strong academic 
programs and free buses for stu-
dents.
“When I was checking out the 
Princeton Review, UF offered many opportunities,” she said.
Lily Flynn, a 20-year-old psy-
chology junior, said activities around town are tailored for the students, such as the vibrant 
nightlife.
“I think that’s what makes a 
good college town: when the city 
conforms around the college and not the other way around,” she 
said.Gainesville named No. 3 college town
Florida has seen nine incidents in ’13
day night. Overnight, his Twitter account, @Bob-
TheShark, gained more than 23,000 followers after only nine tweets.
“‘Shark After Dark’ is hysterical,” Kaplan said. 
“They are putting the fun in science fiction.”
On Saturday, the college entertainment website

The ghost bike for Harris was installed on university property
sister, Anna Harris. James Harris spray-
painted it white and decorated it with flowers and trinkets. 
“I wanted it to look kind of ghostly 
at night,” James Harris said. “We used flowers and butterflies because Rebecca was a very happy young lady and full of 
life.” The Harris family put a poster by the 
bike that reads “Drive Sober.” A picture of 
Rebecca Harris along with a description of what happened the night of the accident is 
there as well.  
The bike hangs on university property 
so it’s exempt from Department of 
Transportation jurisdiction.
Tanja Philhower, assistant dean and 
case manager for the Dean of Students Office at UF, worked with the family to coordinate the ghost bike project. Philhower is responsible for providing support to students and 
families in crisis. 
“I was glad to hear from 
Rebecca’s family when 
they contacted me and 
was heartened to know 
that they were trying to create something 
positive out of Rebecca’s tragic death last year,” she said. “I thought that the ghost bike was a beautiful and powerful way to honor Rebecca’s memory.”   
Catherine Harris, 21, Rebecca Harris’ 
twin sister and a UF public relations senior, said she believed the ghost bike would raise awareness of the situation.
“Even if the bike will only affect one 
person, that’s a plus,” she said. “I hope that people will see it and think twice. Just stop for a minute and think.”

STATE
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
STARKE — A man convicted of murdering eight 
people in Miami-Dade County in the late 1970s was 
executed Monday night at the Florida State Prison, despite his lawyers’ pleas that he was too mentally ill to be put to death.
John Errol Ferguson, 65, died at 6:17 p.m., fol-
lowing a lethal injection.
The execution came less than two hours after 
the U.S. Supreme Court denied a final request for a stay.
Ferguson made a brief statement before 25 wit-
nesses, including family members of the victims.
“I just want everyone to know that I am the 
prince of God and will rise again,” he said calmly.
About three minutes into the procedure, he 
moved his head, strained his neck, moved his feet, put his head back down and closed his eyes.
The entire execution took 16 minutes.About three dozen people protested across the 
street from the prison.
Ferguson and two others were convicted of kill-
ing six people in 1977 during a robbery at a Carol City house used by marijuana dealers. Ferguson dressed as a utility worker to gain access and let his accomplices inside.
Most of the victims were friends who happened 
to drop by the house while Ferguson and the other men were there. The victims were blindfolded and 
bound, and the encounter turned violent after a 
mask fell off one of Ferguson’s gang members and his face was spotted by a victim.
The decision was made to kill all eight people 
in the house. Two survived. At the time, it was the 
worst mass slaying ever in Miami-Dade County.
Ferguson also was convicted of the 1978 murder 
of a 17-year-old couple, Brian Glenfeldt and Belinda 
Worley, from Hialeah. 
They were shot as Ferguson, dressed as a police 
officer, tried to rob them while they were parked at 
a lovers’ lane. Worley was raped.
The randomness of the crime and the age of the 
victims stunned many in Miami. Ferguson con-fessed to killing “the two kids” after he was ar-
rested in April 1978 for the earlier killings, court 
records show.
Worley’s mother, Edna Worley, waited for de-
cades for Ferguson’s execution but died last year.
Ferguson chose to eat the same food other pris-
oners were being served as his final meal: A meat 
and vegetable patty, white bread, stewed tomatoes, potato salad, carrots and iced tea.Convicted murderer executed in Starke
Aug. 9, 1977 - After mass illness was reported on the first 
floor of the Shands Teaching Hospital, more than 200 em-
ployees are tested in a $10,000 investigation prompted by a toxic gas leak that had occurred about two months earlier. Hospital officials say the gas may not be the cause of the ill-ness. Symptoms of the illness include nausea, severe head-aches, vomiting, blistering of the ears and nose, itching and light-headedness.
Aug. 7, 1986 - Louisiana law enforcement officials capture 
convicted murderer Abdula Ben-Hamid, 25, who had es-caped from Alachua General Hospital two days earlier. Ben-Hamid, who was serving a 25-year prison sentence for the 1982 first-degree murder of a Volusia County woman, told investigators that he took a Greyhound bus across Florida and then hitched a ride to Lousiana. 
Aug. 6, 1992 - Gainesville City Commissioners approve an 
increase to Regional Transit System bus fares that is expect-ed to generate about $300,000. Full fares are raised from 50 to 75 cents, while half fares are raised from 25 to 35 cents and grade-school student fares are raised from 10 to 25 cents. 
Aug. 8, 2000 - More than 25 robots built by UF engineer-
ing students are showcased at an Intelligent Machine Design Laboratory demonstration. The robots are able to complete tasks like putting out small fires, navigating through mazes and vacuuming.
Aug. 5, 2008 - A 23-year-old Gainesville man is arrested 
for installing software on a woman’s computer that enabled him to spy on her and her friends via her webcam. Craig Matthew Feigin was also selling the program on eBay, ac-cording to a police report.

At the Prairie Creek Conservation 
Cemetery, there are no headstones. 
There are no immediate markers indicating any graves. There are no signs of death. 
With its wild grass meadows and 
tall, moss-filled oak trees, it bears more resemblance to a hiking trail.
Located just outside Gainesville 
and close to Paynes Prairie, the con-servation cemetery specializes in 
natural or “green” burials. There, 
the deceased are not injected with embalming fluids, and the caskets are biodegradable.
“Ten or 15 years ago this wasn’t 
being done anywhere, but now there are dozens and dozens of these green cemeteries,” said Robert Hutchin-son, a gravedigger at the cemetery. 
The first burial at PCCC was in July 
2010, and now about 75 people are buried there. Another approximately 250 people have predesignated the natural cemetery as their final rest-ing ground, Hutchinson said. With a conventional burial, a concrete or metal vault is placed in the ground, 
and the coffin is placed inside the 
vault. The body in the coffin is filled with chemical fluids that preserve it.
Freddie John-
son, a founder 
of Conservation Burial Inc., the nonprofit organi-zation that started 
PCCC, said it’s 
the only certified conservation cem-etery in Florida. 
Most people choose a traditional 
coffin burial because they just follow convention, Johnson said. 
“[Green burials] are rational and 
still maintains all reverence and re-
spect and dignity for their loved 
ones,” he said.
However, Paul Chadik, associ-
ate professor and department head of UF’s Engineering School of Sus-tainable Infrastructure and Environ-
ment, explained that with both types 
of burials, groundwater contamina-tion, among other adverse effects, can be a concern.
“Over 90 percent of the people in 
Florida use groundwater as a drink-ing water source,” Chadik said. “You want to be able to protect that source from contamination.” 
Because natural burial can be bet-
ter for the environment and also less expensive, Joseph Fitzgerald decid-ed to be buried at the PCCC. The 47-year-old Hawthorne native was laid to rest at the conservation cemetery in February.
“He loved to go out and visit 
Paynes Prairie,” said his brother, 
Michael Fitzgerald. “He liked being 
outdoors and the natural aspects of Florida.” 
Describing the day of his broth-
er’s funeral, Michael Fitzgerald said walking to the burial site was more like a peaceful nature hike. 
“It was sunny out and very pleas-
ant,” he said. “You’re out in nature, 
and you feel like you are in the great-
er cycle of life.” Cemetery offers unique way to go green
About 75 are buried there

been robbed?Today’s question: Are you watching Shark Week?What’s in a Title: 
The Importance of 
the “D” in Democrat
There’s a tired argument that has been used time and 
time again by Republicans. “If Bush were president and 
doing the same things Obama’s doing, he’d never get a 
break.”
They’ve got a point. If there was no “D” next to the presi-
dent’s name and instead an “R,” how would the public view the president?
Since the beginning of his second term, the president has 
progressed the drone wars, sustained the war in Afghanistan, 
admitted to executing American citizens without due pro-
cess, continued mass surveillance efforts, and done nothing but talk about the torture at Guantanamo. 
And that’s to say nothing about his issues with freedom of 
the press, the Snowden asylum dilemma, the queer aftermath of the Benghazi incident, the Syrian “red line” issue, etc., etc.
Obama was even ﬁ  ghting to stop the morning-after pill 
from being available over the counter as late as a few months 
ago.  
There’s just so much that can be addressed. Bradley Man-
ning, domestic drones, raids on legal medical marijuana dis-pensaries, etc. — again. 
And Obama’s second term has only just started: It will end 
in 2017. Where will things go from here?
A classic response might be, “The president has a lot on his 
plate. He can’t address all of these issues.” The president does 
have a lot on his plate; maybe too much. In fact, all of these 
problems are caused in some way or another by the govern-
ment itself being too big and playing a role in too much. The 
power of the executive branch in particular has grown far be-
yond what any single person can rationally oversee.
Who will take his place and inherit these powers when 
the time comes? Who will represent the Democrats and in-
herit that “D” as a candidate? Will it be Hillary Clinton? She 
stepped down as Secretary of State earlier this year, yield-
ing the position to John Kerry. Did she step down to prepare for her campaign with ample time? If so, perhaps she also 
wanted to distance herself from the Obama administration’s 
dismal abuse of power. 
In many ways, this country saw much better times when 
her husband was president. Sure, he had many ﬂ  aws, but at least when Bill Clinton was president this country saw eco-
nomic prosperity, a reduction in the national deﬁ  cit, and a 
foreign policy that was a whole lot better than today’s. 
In any case, it’s going to be a tough choice as usual: Col-
umn A or Column B, the lesser evil versus the greater evil. 
How can we trust any of the “D”s after Obama?
If the choices are bad enough, maybe we’ll look to the third 
parties. No matter what you believe, you have to admit that 
at least parties like the Green Party and the Libertarian Party 
stand on principled ground, much unlike the current parties. 
Or maybe they’re just as bad, promising us a world of good 
only to deliver quite the opposite.
We won’t know until we try.Anti-statists should use, embrace welfare
As hypocritical as it may sound, libertarians, anti-
statists and market anarchists should embrace the welfare state and acquire as many public beneﬁ  ts as 
possible. Many libertarians ﬁ  nd themselves torn between being ultra-purist sectarians or opportunistic sellouts, but 
free-minded citizens should not pigeonhole themselves to 
either of these two dispositions.
If any libertarian were to live a purist, anti-statist life-
style, it would require not walking on public sidewalks, not driving on public roads, not receiving care from govern-ment-licensed doctors and not drinking municipal water. It can be argued that libertarians would be not be able to do anything since the state owns all property and merely rents it to us via taxation.
Under these circumstances it seems impossible to be a 
libertarian and not violate your principals, especially while both Democrats and Republicans are pushing for massive entitlement programs. Both the left and right support the expansion of the welfare state by supporting programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Affairs hospitals and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Any politician that would suggest we eliminate any of 
these programs would be committing political suicide since 
most of society has yet to come to the conclusion that the 
private sector can offer these same services at a more ef-ﬁ  cient rate and at a cheaper cost. So it seems a libertarian is left with no alternative. Yet despite the overwhelming fear of being a labeled a sellout and violating your own personal convictions, a libertarian can and should use any, if not all, of these programs.
Let us suppose there were a gang in Gainesville that 
regularly burglarized homes and this gang were too pow-
erful to be stopped by law enforcement or private citizens. 
This gang of thieves does not keep their plunder but gives it away to other residents of Gainesville. The victims of this theft would not be acting immorally by attempting to re-coup the goods stolen from them. Anyone who is opposed to this theft would actually be acting as a moral agent by retrieving these goods since they are relieving this gang of their stolen possessions.Professor of economics at 
Loyola University Walter Block is one of the many anarcho-cap-italists that defends anti-statists using public assistance programs. 
Block’s defense of libertarians us-
ing public assistance is derived from the non-aggression principle (NAP), which libertarian philoso-phy is based upon.
Since the NAP states that the initiation of force is illegiti-
mate, one would assume that using public services would contradict the NAP because force was used to acquire the funds for these programs. Block explains in a piece titled 
“May a Libertarian Take Money From the Government?” 
that using public assistance does not violate the NAP.
Block explains that if Z were to steal goods from Y and 
give them to X, X would be completely moral in using these goods because X never initiated force against Y to obtain these goods. Thus, X has never violated the NAP and is completely moral in consuming these goods and does not violate the NAP by doing so. Block goes on to state, “Cer-tainly, all libertarian theories of private property rights, of 
punishment, would agree that of all people in the world, Z 
is the absolutely least deserving of this foodstuff.” 
Keep in mind the fact that the state creates nothing 
and has absolutely no resources except for the ones that it steals from its citizens. Therefore the best current option for counteracting this theft is to participate in entitlement pro-grams.
Being a libertarian does not mean being a martyr for the 
cause of free markets and peace. There is nothing wrong 
with walking on government sidewalks, eating price-con-
trolled bread or living in a rent-controlled apartment be-cause none of these conditions are of libertarian making. These conditions are simply our current matrix. and liber-tarians should take advantage of them while still agitating and speaking out against the state.

“Doctor Who” fans around the 
world tuned in to various BBC 
outlets on Sunday to ﬁ  nd out 
who would play the role of The Doc-
tor’s 12th incarnation.
This prompted every social me-
dia site I’m a member of — and I’m sure even ones I’m not — to explode 
with activity to the point where it was 
all I could see on my feeds without scrolling an irksome amount. “Doctor 
Who” on Facebook, “Doctor Who” on 
Tumblr, “Doctor Who” in chat rooms, Twitter — I bet even MySpace explod-
ed with activity.
I’m not part of the fandom, so see-
ing only “Doctor Who” quickly got repetitive and old quickly, not unlike 
radio stations overplaying a song to the point where it’s merely annoying.
But then, I realized something: Not 
everyone cares about what I post. I’ve single-handedly ﬂ  ooded news feeds 
when World Cup matches were on. 
It’d be a double standard if I spoke out against it.
This was a momentous occasion for 
that group of fans. It was their day to rejoice, examine, criticize and discuss 
the merits the new Doctor has as an 
actor and then speculate on how he would perform as the Doctor.
I was also lucky enough to hold my 
tongue when others complained about the “Doctor Who” fans and then get 
metaphorically eaten alive for having 
the gall to complain during the rapid reaction. Seeing what happened to 
those people was enough to cause me 
to reconsider.
Essentially, this column comes 
down to a reminder of civility.
Granted, there isn’t as much a need 
to make that reminder to those read-
ing this column in print.
For those reading online who have 
a comments section about 300 words down, it is more relevant. For those 
reading online who can “share this article on Facebook” 
while add-
ing their own edito-
rial, this 
reminder is p e r t i n e n t . 
For those 
reading on-
line who can respond in about 40 char-
acters and include the link, this goes 
out to you.
This isn’t to slam the online com-
menters — please don’t make that assumption. Commenting provides discussion of issues and adds to the 
marketplace of ideas.
My point lies in the inherent basis 
of Internet comments, which is the an-onymity that accompanies most sites. 
That anonymity allows for people to become venomous, attacking the other 
people instead of debating with them.
It can even lead to people attacking 
celebrities for no reason more than that they’re celebrities. Behind a username, 
people can act less than human.
There are countless tales of cyber-
bullying and of people being decon-structed while on the Internet.
These stories are not limited to 
middle and high school students. I’ve seen the same thing happen to college freshmen, college seniors and college 
graduates.
As the semester winds down and 
we get a break, I’m sure a good chunk of us will spend our time online. We 
might be behind usernames instead of tied to Facebook accounts — accounts 
that can still be falsiﬁ  ed. I would just 
like to encourage civil responses, even if the other side refuses to do the same 
for you.
Oh, and spoiler alert: The 12th Doc-
tor is Peter Capaldi.

opinions@alligator.orgI’ve been working with the Alligator for nearly 
a year, ﬁ  rst as a columnist and now as Opin-
ions editor. As my time here at UF comes to 
a close and as I wonder about my own future, I 
feel more strongly than ever that the future of us 
all depends in no small part on the Internet. 
Before I get into the meat of that topic, I’d like 
to say a few words about my own positions. I’ve 
expressed many libertarian ideas in my pieces 
for the Alligator. I wish to make it clear that I’m 
not a perfect libertarian. My ﬁ  rst priority is to 
humanity. The monopoly over the legal use of 
force that the state possesses can be very useful 
in pursuing human well-being. However, I also 
realize that by giving the state power it isn’t due 
that I’m probably helping create a very scary fu-
ture. It’s a tough question, but I err on the side of 
having a smaller state with limited powers. 
And how could I not? Too often, the state 
ends up creating more harm than the problem it pretends to be solving.
Not only that, but I fear greatly that with ev-
ery responsibility we cast onto the government 
that we’re only getting closer to what Edward Snowden called “turnkey tyranny.” Whether or 
not you believe in the benevolence of any so-
called public servant, you have to admit that the 
possibility of a tyrant one day misusing his or 
her powers one day does exist. 
The public, I think, can provide the greatest 
check to any regime in a democratic system. In 
order for us to check our government, though, 
we must become informed. Maybe I’ve been 
preaching to the choir, and maybe you’re sick 
and tired of me harping on this point, but it’s a 
very, very important point.
We live in an age in which we’re all drowning 
in media, and yet how many of us bother taking 
the time to share a news link on Facebook? The act may seem trivial, but trust me when I say 
that it isn’t. Just having the headlines ﬂ  oating 
around on the News Feed awakens the public consciousness in a way that could not have been 
so easily done in the time before the Internet. 
Despite the somber tone of many of my 
pieces, I have a great amount of hope for the 
future. Alternative sources of news media like 
RT, which has classically played a less-reputable 
role, have ﬁ  nally found a niche among a grow-ing population of peo-ple hungry to know 
the dirty deeds of 
the state. The Young Turks on YouTube is 
now one of the most 
widely watched news 
sources anywhere, and 
they started only as a 
ragtag group of people 
who wanted to report 
and editorialize. 
And this is a good sign, too. There’s a grow-
ing number of people who are not only hungry to learn more, but who see through the lies that 
the populace has historically fallen into — that 
the voice of a single person is insigniﬁ  cant. This 
is a consciousness-changing moment in history, 
when the people can truly democratize infor-mation, when you don’t need to have a billion 
dollars to broadcast yourself to a million — and 
maybe even a billion — people. One of the most 
exquisite qualities of this age is that it’s all prac-
tically free. Information is free! What a revolu-tion! This is true power, and it’s scary to the 
power structures that have classically enjoyed 
the privilege of controlling information and con-
trolling a docile and uninformed public. How 
lucky we are to live in such a time. 
Such consciousness-changing events have 
happened before, but they have never been so 
impactful. The release of the Pentagon Papers in 
the ‘70s, for example, taught us that what Orwell 
had warned us about so long ago could actually 
be true: The government can lie to us, and it 
probably does. 
Whistleblowers are now seen by a great 
many as heroes. And the government is seen as 
the bad guys. And rightfully so.
The Internet is no less than the greatest inven-
tion the world has ever known. The freedoms we enjoy there must be protected at all costs. If ever the day should come when the “turnkey 
tyranny” Snowden spoke of should come to 
pass, all will be lost.
On Thursday, I’ll talk a bit more on this issue 
as well as what the future may hold for human-
ity as a whole.

As Shaenah Matheney prepared to perform for a group 
of 7- to 17-year-olds, she did not expect to feel butterflies 
in her stomach.
“I was so nervous,” 24-year-old Matheney said. “I felt 
pressured. They were looking to us like we’re really cool 
or something.”
Matheney’s band, Emmenagogue, played a 10-minute 
set on the first day of Gainesville’s Rock and Roll Camp for 
Girls on Monday. 
The weeklong camp, hosted at Studio Percussion, 2512 
NE First Blvd., includes concerts, music lessons and work-shops, such as belly dancing instruction.
Jen Vito and Chelsea Carnes, co-directors of the camp, have been planning the project for the past 6 months. The 
goal, Vito said, is to empower girls through forms of self-
expression.
Twenty-seven girls showed up for the first day of camp. 
For some, it was their first time taking music lessons.
“I want to be able to sing better,” said 14-year-old Leah 
Elholm, who began learning keyboard on Monday. 
Vito, who worked at a similar camp in Jacksonville, said 
she thinks the one-week format of the program is part of what makes it empowering.
“One of the benefits, I think, from having a short amount 
of time like that is you really learn how possible things are,” Vito said. “I expect to see a personal transformation from everyone. I think it’s going to be a beautiful experience.”
The girls will be broken up into bands of five to six 
members and will perform a showcase on Saturday at 1982 Bar, which Vito owns. The girls will perform songs written 
during the camp as well as covers of classics. Admission 
will be $5 to $10.
If the Q-and-A session following Monday’s concert is 
any indication, the girls will be more than ready to rock by then.
When a guitarist said the set was quieter than usual, the 
girls looked around excitedly.
“Awesome!” the girls said. “Play it loud!”Rock out: Weeklong music camp to conclude in 1982 showcase� IPADS CAN BE CHECKED OUT AT

The increasing number of smart-
phones and technological devices among

“We are working on expanding our 
mobile apps,” said Jennifer K. Smith, 
manager of instructional design services 
at UF’s Center for Instructional Technol-ogy and Training.
The center is aiming to increase the 
number of lecture videos available to mobile devices, Smith said, and it has 
developed an application to create online 
flashcards to help students get ready for 
exams.Smith said phones are being used in 
the classroom to incorporate instant stu-
dent feedback and to promote interactive 
learning. Educational apps can be used 
for instant polls and quizzes. 
UF geography professor Paul Ciesiel-
ski said technology allows for classes to 
be more convenient, interactive and af-fordable. 
“Students these days do a lot of mul-
titasking,” he said. “Sometimes they find 
it a little boring reading an old-fashioned 
textbook.”
Tablet devices are also widely used at 
UF. 
iPads are available for checkout at 
Library West, and Stacey Ewing, infor-mation commons coordinator at Library 
West, said in an email interview that an-other proposal submitted for more iPads 
was approved.
But things don’t always go according 
to plan.
Melissa Espino, an overnight shift su-

Injuries strike Gators before camp
PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer 
Colin Thompson was expected 
to offer another dimension to Flori-
da’s tight end group in 2012 before a foot injury derailed his season be-fore it began.
Now healthy, Thompson has 
impressed coach Will Muschamp early in fall camp.
“I think Colin Thompson’s done 
some nice things for us — blocking from a point (and in) the passing game,” Muschamp said Monday. “We’ve improved from where we were from the spring, and that’s 
what you want to do is take a step 
forward from where you were.
“I think certainly we’ve taken 
some positive steps from spring at this point.”
Thompson, who was rated the 
nation’s No. 2 tight end by ESPN 
and Scout.com coming out of high 
school, underwent surgery in the spring of 2012 and was expected to miss the first 10 days of preseason practice. 
Instead, he was forced to go un-
der the knife a second time, having a screw inserted into his right foot to help repair a fractured bone last August. He eventually earned a medical redshirt after missing the entire season.
Thompson enters 2013 as one of 
five scholarship tight ends on UF’s roster. The group will compete to fill the role vacated by Jordan Reed, 
who was selected by the Washing-
ton Redskins in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft.
Replacing 
Reed is criti-cal for Flori-da’s offense. Reed caught 
45 passes for 559 yards in 2012 — each led the team — and hauled in three touchdowns while serving as 
the primary security blanket for Jeff 
Driskel. 
Given that Florida’s group of 
wide receivers continues to be a work-in-progress, the Gators are searching aggressively for a tight end that can become Driskel’s main safety valve. 
“Jordan Reed was a big-time 
player for us; He’s a great athlete,” Driskel said at UF’s media day. “You don’t really find a player like him too much, but we do have a couple of guys who have stepped up over the summer, and I’m excit-ed to see them moving forward.”
Driskel singled out Thompson 
as someone he hopes will continue to progress.
“Colin Thompson finally seems 
to be healthy,” Driskel said, “so (I 
am) really excited to see where he’s 
at.”
Similar to the receiving corps, 
Florida’s tight ends have nothing resembling a track record of suc-cess. Of the five scholarship tight ends, only two — Kent Taylor and Clay Burton — have caught passes during their college career. Neither has more than two receptions. 
The group also includes Tevin 
Westbrook, who did not record a reception while playing in 13 games last season after switching from de-fensive end to tight end before the year, and Trevon Young, a last-minute addition to Florida’s most recent recruiting class who played only two years of high school foot-ball.

Former Gator  Ryan Lochte 
recorded three of his 15 World 
Championships titles in Barce-lona, Spain, over the past week, bringing his career medal count 
to 23 at Worlds. Two of his gold 
medals came in a two-hour span where he swam in three different events on Friday.
“I wasn’t really thinking 
about the triple at all,” Lochte said in a post-swim interview. “I was just focusing on my first race, after that my second and 
my third.”
He led start-to-finish in the 
200-meter backstroke final, 
clocking in at 1:53.79. He post-ed the top qualifying time in the 100-meter butterfly semi-fi-nal (51.48) 55 minutes later. He finished off the day with a first-place finish in the 4x200-meter 
freestyle relay (7:01.72).
Lochte set the fastest time in all three events during the 
same day of competition and remains the only swimmer to compete at a World Champion-ships and win two gold med-als in the same day on three 
separate occasions. He previ-
ously accomplished the feat on March 30, 2007 and again on July 29, 2011.
He need-
ed some help en route to his record-setting day. 
As a part of 
the 4x200-meter free relay team, along with 
Charles Houchin, Ricky Berens and former Gator All-Amer-ican Conor Dwyer, Lochte brought his team from third to 
first on the second leg of the re-
lay, which his two teammates would not surrender.UF shines at meets

Missing four projected starters on offense before 
fall camp opens is rare, but that is the situation the 
Gators faced last week.
If the past month is any indication, Florida could 
be in for an interesting season.
The Gators opened camp Friday without junior 
quarterback Jeff Driskel, who underwent an emer-
gency appendectomy on July 29. 
According to coach Will Muschamp, running back 
Matt Jones developed a “serious viral infection” four 
or five days prior to UF’s media day, which was held Thursday. 
On Monday, Muschamp said Jones was recover-
ing from the infection and had lost eight to 10 pounds, but he was starting to work out.
Offensive linemen Jon Halapio (partially torn pec-
toral muscle) and Max Garcia (back) were also out for the start of camp. Halapio is listed as the start-ing right guard; Garcia, who transferred to UF from Maryland, expects to be the first-team left guard.
“It has been a strange, strange couple of weeks,” 
fullback Hunter Joyer said. 
Driskel woke up on July 29 with stomach pain, 
and after doing research on the effects and symptoms of appendicitis, went to the UF facility for treatment. 
“He said he had a stomach ache,” Muschamp said. 
“I hoped he ate a bad cheeseburger, but it wasn’t.”
Shortly afterward, the team medical staff de-
termined Driskel needed to have his appendix re-moved. The timetable for his return is about two weeks, though similar to the situation with Jones, 
when Driskel returns to the field will depend mainly 
on how his body recovers.
“I’m starting to feel better already,” Driskel said 
Thursday. “We’ll see. Recovery time, they said it var-
ies for everybody. We’re not going to rush anything, 
but I don’t think I’m going to miss too much. I’ll be there getting the mental reps; I’ll be right there be-hind the huddle.”
A year after going 11-2 to earn a BCS Bowl appear-
ance — the program’s first since 2009 — the Gators expected a relatively calm start to camp. 
Unlike last season, when UF entered camp facing 
a tense quarterback competition and was starting the 
process of integrating first-year offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease’s system, few storylines were expected in 2013.
Instead, the offensive unit is left scrambling to get 
healthy in time for Florida’s season opener against 
Toledo on Aug. 31. 
“Adversity will always be present, that’s some-
thing that I have learned in life,” center Jonotthan 
Harrison said. “Adversity will only make you stron-
ger. The offense being thrown all these curveballs 
and all kinds of adversity, I really believe that is just going to make us stronger as a unit and as a team.”
Of the four players limited, Driskel being out 
leaves the most glaring hole.

thrown a pass during his college career, entered camp as Florida’s No. 1 quarterback. Behind Mur-

FOOTBALL
  ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  For the last two seasons, when the 
Gators lined up for a ﬁ  eld goal, Flor-
ida fans could rest assured that three 
points would soon be on the board.
  Kicker Caleb Sturgis’ ﬁ  ve years at 
UF were the most proliﬁ  c of any kick-
er in Florida’s history, but coach Will Muschamp is tasked with replacing him this season.
  The two main contenders for the job 
are redshirt freshman Austin Hardin and senior Brad Phillips.
  “It’s our turn to have our careers 
here,” Hardin said at UF media day on Thursday.
  Added Phillips: “The standard’s 
been set for kickers here at Florida.”
  Sturgis left behind large shoes to 
ﬁ  ll. 
  He was a ﬁ  nalist for the Lou Groza 
Award in 2011 and 2012 and made the Associated Press All-Southeastern Conference team. He garnered All-America honors from both CBSSports.
com and the Sporting News.
  Phillips, a Gainesville native who 
kicked for Buchholz High, had a chance 
to replace Sturgis in 2011 and 2012. Phillips made two ﬁ  eld goals against Georgia in 2011, including a 43-yard kick. In 2012, he missed his one ﬁ  eld goal opportunity against Missouri. He averaged 62.8 yards on 27 kickoffs over the past three seasons.
  “When I was a freshman … I never 
thought I’d even get a chance to play,” he said. “Throughout the years, I’ve been getting bits and pieces on ﬁ  eld goals and kickoffs, so it’s good to get that game experience.”
  Hardin has yet to step onto the ﬁ  eld 
for the Gators. The second-year kicker earned a redshirt last year. 
  However, Hardin was one of the 
most highly touted kickers in the 2012 recruiting class. ESPN rated him a 
three-star recruit and the top kicker in 
the nation. But with Sturgis and Phil-lips on the roster already, Muschamp redshirted the freshman.
  “The biggest thing about my redshirt 
year was just getting used to things,” Hardin said. “A year was amazing for me to learn behind someone who was great at what they did.”
  “It helped me grow on the mental 
side a lot with different kicks and miss-ing one and not getting down about it.”
  Hardin and Phillips have about 
three weeks to prove themselves to Muschamp and new special teams coach Jeff Choate before Florida opens its season against Toledo on Aug. 31.
  Muschamp said the most important 
aspect to the position is a kicker’s ac-
curacy, and said that both players were 
accurate “at times.” But he also said he 
wanted to have one person take control of the position and not switch kickers throughout the year.
  “I’d like for one guy to take the job, 
there’s no question,” he said. “We need production at the position … If you’re not getting the production, you need to 
take a look somewhere else.”
  Both players know the coaching staff 
is looking to name one starter, but Phil-
lips thinks the Gators can be successful naming either as Sturgis’ replacement.
  “The good thing about our competi-
tion is it’s a great kicker versus a great kicker,” Phillips said. “We both know the game of football, we both know how to kick footballs.”

AS STEIN ON TV
 “You were the Chosen One! It 
was said you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring 
balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!”
  Obi-Wan Kenobi shouted those 
words at Anakin Skywalker (Spoiler alert: Anakin becomes Darth Vader), but the same lines are equally appli-cable to Alex Rodriguez.
  Rodriguez was the Chosen One 
of Major League Baseball. He was going to be the one to vanquish Bar-ry Bonds’ tainted marks and restore 
balance to the record book.
  But on Monday, MLB suspended 
Rodriguez for his role in the Bio-
genesis scandal and his attempts to cover up evidence implicating him.
  Even though Rodriguez didn’t 
fail a drug test, his legacy is as taint-ed as his urine would have been. He doesn’t need to fail a test.
  Rodriguez is appealing his sus-
pension, but MLB reportedly has a novel’s worth of evidence pinning A-Rod to the Biogenesis clinic.
  I watched Rodriguez win two 
MVP awards in New York, and I marveled as he put the 2009 Yan-kees on his back en route to a World Series title.
  Those were the memories I ex-
pected to have when I told my kids 
about him. 
The prodigious shots that carried 
over Monument Park, the walk-off 
homers, how he graciously accepted 
a move to third base to allow Yan-
kees captain Derek Jeter to continue 
playing shortstop, even though he 
was clearly the superior defender.
  Nope. Not anymore. The only 
things people are going to remem-ber are 
that he cheated, lied and tried to 
game the 
s y s t e m . That ri-diculous mega-
contract might get a mention, too.
  What he did on the ﬁ  eld doesn’t 
matter anymore, and that’s a shame. He was a great player. 
He was easily on pace to set the 
home run record and reach 3,000 hits. Injuries sapped his strength during the last few seasons, and now the imminent suspension puts him out of action for an entire year. Both marks are almost deﬁ  nitely out of reach. 
He was a 40-40 player and a 
three-time MVP. Doesn’t matter.
  Los Angeles Angels ﬁ  rst base-
man Albert Pujols may be the next great hope, but he has slumped since leaving the Cardinals, leaving 
no one to cleanse the record books.
  I always thought Rodriguez was 
very image-conscious. I thought the 
reason why he struggled in the play-offs was because he put so much pressure on himself. He wanted people to like him.
  But maybe I was wrong. Some-
one who was interested in his legacy 
wouldn’t put it in such danger by 
using steroids.
  I thought Rodriguez wanted to 
be the good guy, but now he’s just the steroid-using Darth A-Rod.

Junior wins Male High Point award
  It was Dwyer’s second medal of 
the meet. He claimed a sliver in the 
200-meter free earlier in the week.
  Junior Elizabeth Beisel also 
got in on the medal action with a 
bronze performance on Sunday in 
the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:31.69.
  In his World Championships 
debut, sophomore Dan Wallace ﬁ  n-ished in seventh during the ﬁ  nals of the 400-meter IM with a time of 4:13.72.
  Two other Gators posted their 
best international ﬁ  nishes on Satur-day. Freshman Sinead Russell took seventh in the 200-meter back ﬁ  nal (2:10.46), and junior Hilda Luthers-dottir’s 31.37 in the 50-meter breast 
preliminaries earned her 13th-place 
ﬁ  nish.
  But Lochte didn’t see only suc-
cess. The United States 4x100-meter medley relay team was disqualiﬁ  ed during the breaststroke leg.
  Former and current Gator 
swimmers combined to earn four gold medals, three silvers and one 
bronze at the 15th World Champi-
onships.
  Also taking place this past week 
was the U.S. Open Championships in Irvine, Calif. 
  Rousseau owned the long-
course pool, sweeping his events and claiming four gold medals. He was named the Male High Point of the meet for his efforts.
  His ﬁ  rst victory came on July 30, 
the opening day of the meet, in the 200-meter ﬂ  y. His time of 1:55.64 was more than half of a second ahead of second place. Two days later he claimed the 400-meter IM gold medal (4:11.11) by blowing out the competition. The closest swimmer was 4.7 seconds behind 
Rousseau’s pace.
  Rousseau dominated the ﬁ  eld 
on Friday in the 200-meter free 
(1:48.51) and again on Saturday for the 200-meter IM (1:59.58) to com-plete the sweep.

SWIM , from page 13Mornhinweg and incoming freshman Max Staver, 
leaving the Gators with essentially no experience at the position. 
  “I don’t think it’s ever good for you that your 
starter is not taking the reps at any position,” Mus-champ said, “certainly the quarterback position.”
  Florida is in better shape along the offensive 
line and at tailback. 
  Muschamp said Tyler Moore, a transfer from 
Nebraska, has the ability to ﬁ  ll in at each of the ﬁ  ve spots on the offensive line. UF also returns six other offensive linemen who earned regular play-
ing time last season.   At running back, Mack Brown, Kelvin Taylor 
and Mark Herndon will split snaps in Jones’ ab-
sence. Muschamp also mentioned Joyer and Trey Burton as two other candidates to earn work out 
of the backﬁ  eld. 
  “We’ve got a motto around here: man down, 
man up,” Muschamp said. “I challenged the foot-
ball team just in a meeting right now; it’s time for 
somebody to respond.
  “When you sign at the University of Florida,

WHAT TO EXPECT
 Despite winning as many national 
championships as the football team this decade, Billy Dono-
van’s group has always played second ﬁ  ddle in Gainesville. 
  The Gators men’s basketball team 
could make the Final Four and a story about spring football would still get more views. Maybe I’m exaggerating a bit, but that’s what the culture is like at UF. 
  Last season, Florida basketball was 
about as successful as Florida football. No. 3 seed UF was a little bit under the 
radar nationally but still earned its third 
straight trip to the Elite Eight, where it lost to No. 4 seed Michigan, the eventual NCAA runner-up, 79-59. 
  The Gators may have lost three start-
ing seniors – Kenny Boynton, Erik Mur-phy and Mike Rosario – who combined for 50.5 percent of their offense last year, but Donovan’s squad deserves more at-
tention from Florida fans this upcoming 
season. There are too many storylines to ignore.
  Part of the reason for last year’s short-
age of national attention was a lack of NBA talent. Murphy was the only Gator drafted, going in the second round to the Chicago Bulls.
But   UF will have plenty of NBA pros-
pects in 2013-14.
  Patric Young, a 6-foot-9, 240-pound 
center, has the NBA frame to be drafted in the late ﬁ  rst-round or early second-round in 2014, but he needs to prove his worth after an up-and-down junior season. Incoming ﬁ  ve-star point guard Kasey Hill has the potential to be a lot-tery pick if he lives up to his billing. 
  The Gators are still awaiting the 
NCAA Clearinghouse’s ruling on ﬁ  ve-star addition Chris Walker, who is deal-ing with academic eligibility issues. If the 6-foot-10 Walk-er – a lanky forward with freakish athleti-cism – joins the 
team, Florida 
will most cer-tainly land in the AP Pre-
season Top 10. 
  Eligible or ineligible, Walker should 
be at least a top-20 pick in next year’s draft, barring a setback. 
  Donovan is also awaiting word on 
guard Eli Carter’s eligibility for the 2013-14 season. Following the mess Mike Rice left at Rutgers after verbally and physi-cally abusing his players, Carter elected to transfer to UF in late April. He is at-tempting to receive a waiver from the NCAA that would allow him to play for the Gators next year.
  The addition of Carter would solidify 
Florida’s backcourt – especially with starting point guard Scottie Wilbekin’s status in limbo.
  Donovan suspended Wilbekin indeﬁ  -
nitely on June 10 for violating team rules. Wilbekin has not rejoined the team yet; Donovan said last month that he would meet with Wilbekin once the fall semes-ter starts and “go from there.”
  If Carter and Wilbekin both do not 
make the rotation for the 2013-14 sea-son, Florida could have some issues in the backcourt. Jacob Kurtz or Donovan’s son, also named Billy Donovan, could be forced into the rotation as a backup point guard. 
  But with or without Wilbekin, Carter 
or Walker, Florida will enter 2013-14 
with its deepest frontcourt in years. 
  UF adds Virginia Tech transfer for-
ward Dorian Finney-Smith, who sat out 
2012-13 per NCAA transfer rules and was a top-35 recruit out of high school. South Carolina transfer center Damontre Harris also joins the group this year and should provide shot-blocking and depth behind Young.
  Seniors Will Yeguete and Casey 
Prather, two of Florida’s most versatile defenders, should also see more playing time in the rotation. 
  According to this year’s roster, Yeg-
uete and Young have each lost about 10 pounds since the beginning of last sea-son. Yeguete should return to the team by training camp after undergoing ar-
throscopic debridement on his right knee 
on May 22. Young underwent surgery on April 12 to remove a bone spur from his right ankle and is “progressing ﬁ  ne,” according to what Donovan said in July. 
  Sophomore shooting guard Michael 
Frazier II, who had a solid summer with the USA U-19 squad at the FIBA World Championships, cannot be forgotten, 
either. I’m sure he learned plenty from 
competing against high-level talent. Maybe we’ll see more dimensions to his game this year in addition to his sharp three-point shooting.  
  The Gators’ non-conference schedule 
features some tasty treats. Florida will play Memphis in the Jimmy V Classic in Madison Square Garden on Dec. 17, but 
the most tantalizing matchup is Florida-
Kansas on Dec. 10. I want to see how the Gators plan on guarding phenom swingman Andrew Wiggins, the world’s unanimous No. 1 pick for the 2014 NBA Draft. 
  I know it’s August, and football is 
king in this region, but please be as in-terested in the 2013-14 college basketball 
season as I am. 
  Pretty please?
