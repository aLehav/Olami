Claudia Aguilar sobs on her husband, Carlos, as he addresses reporters during a news conference at the University Police Department on Saturday evening. What are possibly the remains of missing UF student Christian Aguilar were found Friday afternoon deep in the woods of a hunting reserve in Levy County.

After about a month of un-
answered questions, miles of 
searching and holding onto hope, the Aguilar family may have the closure it prayed for.
On Saturday, Carlos Agui-
lar and his wife, Claudia Agui-lar, addressed reporters inside the University Police depart-ment about investigators’ re-cent discovery: a body found in Levy County that may be the couple’s missing son, Christian Aguilar.
Carlos Aguilar’s wife cried 
on his arm as he thanked vol-unteers and supporters for their help in the search.
“We, as a family , believe that 
Christian has been found and our prayers have been heard,” he said.
On Friday afternoon, 
Gainesville Police responded to a call from the Levy County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce about human remains found inside the Gulf Hammock Hunting Club, a 25,000-acre wooded area about 40 miles southwest of Gainesville.
Two hunters looking for ﬁ  re-
wood found a partially buried body after smelling what they thought was a dead deer. The body , found near a dirt road, had blue Vans sneakers, blue jeans and duct tape, according to published reports.
The jeans and sneakers 
match the same clothes Chris-tian Aguilar, 18, wore in a Best 
Buy surveil-lance photo, released by GPD, taken 
the day he went miss-ing, the re-ports stated. Police have not con-
ﬁ  rmed the body to be Aguilar.
V olunteers temporarily 
suspended Saturday’s search when the family heard of the body’s discovery.
Investigators are performing 
an autopsy and will release their ﬁ  ndings, including the body’s identiﬁ  cation, this week. 
The Aguilar family said it 
planned to stay in Gainesville until the body is identiﬁ  ed.

The sounds of eclectic music and 
smells of frying food drifted among 
droves of art lovers through the brick streets of downtown Gainesville Sun-day.
The 31st Downtown Festival & Art 
Show packed downtown with about 100,000 people Saturday and Sunday.
People drifted among tents dis-
playing photographs, paintings, jew-elry, ceramics and art created through countless other mediums.
Linda Piper, event coordinator for 
the city’s Department of Parks, Recre-ation and Cultural Affairs, said about 50,000 people came to the festival each day this weekend.“It’s like throwing a street party 
for 100,000 of your closest friends,” Piper said.
But this party took up more than 
one street.
Police blocked off a chunk of 
downtown spanning from just north of City Hall to the Hippodrome State Theatre and from Main Street to Southeast Third Street.

Five former Florida governors met Friday to 
discuss the future.
Governors Reubin Askew, Bob Graham, 
Bob Martinez, Buddy MacKay and Charlie 
Crist spoke to each other — and an audience of about 500 people — as part of the 2012 Allen L. Poucher Legal Education Series. Ben Diamond, a UF Levin College of Law graduate, moder-ated the conversation.
Askew, Florida’s 37th governor, served from 
1971 to 1979. He was succeeded by Graham, who has a reputation as “Florida’s Education Governor.” Martinez was the ﬁ  rst Hispanic governor and helped implement Florida’s Growth Management Act. MacKay was the 42nd governor, and he served brieﬂ  y after the death of Lawton Chiles. The most recent gov-ernor at the event was Crist, who left ofﬁ  ce in 2011.
Askew said the state changed immensely since he was in ofﬁ  ce.
MacKay said that when he started his po-
litical career, it was a time of great change in Florida. Back then, people were against unnec-essary change, and today they have the same thinking, he said.
“Here we are again, legislative leaderships 
faced the wrong way,” Mac-Kay said.
The governors also dis-
cussed the three Florida Su-
preme Court justices who are on the retention vote on the November ballot.
Askew, who started the 
merit retention program, said the judges should remain in 
ofﬁ  ce and out of partisan politics.
“We have to keep the judges independent,” 
he said.
Crist, who was late to the event due to a 
ﬂ  ight delay in Miami, discussed oil drilling off the coast of Florida. He said the BP oil spill was the “greatest wake-up call” to the environ-ment. He said there are other ways to produce Governors meet to discuss future

October 17, 1973: The colleges of dentistry and engineering 
were contracted to explore the possibility of implanting false teeth in humans. As a part of the three-year study, 24 African baboons had four of their front teeth removed and replaced with synthetic implants. The teeth were made of chrome alloy, an acrylic plastic, and a new bioglass-ceramic material devel-oped by researchers in the College of Engineering. 
October 14, 1988: The City Commission of Gainesville voted to 
send city employees who wanted to stop smoking to a clinic for free. If they kicked the habit for good, the city would pick up the $110 tab. If the employee started smoking again, he or she would have to pay back the money. 
October 14, 1991: As a new record was reached for people at 
a UF football game — 85,135 people — some people could not contain their excitement. Police ejected 85 people from the game for misconduct including from disorderly intoxication, object throwing and ticket switching. Some were even removed from the stadium for urinating on other fans.

The Murphree Area had no 
shortage of sausage Sunday.
About 210 students, alumni and Gainesville residents filled the Mur -
phree Commons Courtyard to enjoy 
an inflatable obstacle course, live music, a chance to pie residential as-sistants in the face and, of course, 90 pounds of sausage.
About 380 sausages — includ-
ing bratwurst, mild Italian and hot Italian — and 30 veggie burgers were served at the ninth annual SausageFest, said Jennifer Becker, a 19-year-old recreation, parks and tourism sophomore and SausageF-est co-committee chairwoman.
Because the Inter-Residence Hall 
Association helped with the cost of the obstacle course, organizers bought more sausages than usual, Becker said. The Murphree Area Council spent about $300.
“The event wasn’t there to raise 
money ,” said Patsy Phillips, MAC residential assistant liaison and a 20-year-old recreation, parks and tourism sophomore. “More so, it was to provide residents with a fun Sunday afternoon full of food, games and, of course, sausages.”
With the smell of sizzling sausag-
es in the fall air, they did. For four hours, attendees ate, challenged each other on the obstacle course and took pictures with a giant hotdog — 20-year-old telecommunication ju-nior Charlene Ochogo, wearing the costume she called “awesome.

With a hotdog in one hand and a 
drumstick in the other, 70-year-old 
John Fullerton pounded out a steady beat as 13 people and a dog ambled down University Avenue.
To celebrate the one-year anniver -
sary of Occupy Gainesville, a protest movement inspired by Occupy Wall Street, a group of movement mem-bers marched from Bo Diddley Com-munity Plaza to 13th Street, holding signs and wearing black T-shirts that displayed the phrase, “We are the 99 percent.”
The Occupy Gainesville move-
ment kicked off about a month af-ter Occupy Wall Street’s influence spread to cities across the world. 
Occupy Gainesville members or -
ganized several protests during the past year, including a few during which members were arrested on charges of trespassing. Bo Diddley’s son was among the people arrested.
Nancy Jones, 49, said she joined 
the Occupy movement in November because she was thirsty for activism.
She said Occupy Gainesville rep-
resents several causes, from home-lessness to environmentalism.
“We all feel it’s critically impor -tant to build communities and wake up to what’s a sustainable activity and what’s not,” Jones said.
Before their march, the Occupy 
members took brightly colored chalk to the bricks of Bo Diddley Com-munity Plaza, scrawling slogans like “We’ve got chalk, they’ve got guns — tell me, who are the violent ones?”
A man with dreadlocks strummed 
a mandolin as the protesters sang “Happy Birthday” to themselves.
The movement has lost momen-
tum throughout the course of the year, said 59-year-old Annette Gilley . She said she attended a training ses-sion at Occupy Wall Street, where she learned how to interrupt “business as usual” on Wall Street.
During Friday’s march, a small 
mix-breed dog, Albie, sniffed bushes along the route, following the small crowd. At one point, a man wearing a bandana over his face sat down in the road facing traffic.
As the marchers passed Bank of 
America, they started yelling, “Banks got bailed out. We got sold out.” When they reached the street corner in front of Holiday Inn, the Occupy members posed for a commemora-tive photo.
“Now everybody say bulls**t,” 
the cameraman said. Occupy Gainesville members celebrate one year with march

As part of the yearly Gator Garba 
celebration, hundreds went to the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center on Sat-urday for a night filled with dancing and traditional Indian music.
Students and Gainesville com-
munity members attended, as well as people from Tampa, Orlando and Tallahassee, said Payal Shah, a 19-year-old biology sophomore and the Indian Student Association sec-retary.
The Indian Student Associa-
tion hosted the event in honor of Navratri, a Hindu celebration that lasts nine nights.
The majority of attendees were 
dressed in traditional Indian gar -
ments like chaniya cholis and kur -
tas. The styles of dance performed, known as garba and raas, gave glimpses of barefoot feet moving underneath flowing skirts as wom-en skipped and hopped.Heena Joshi, a 20-year-old biolo-
gy junior, said the dances are taught to people starting from a young age.
“We grew up with the dances,” 
she said. “When we get here, they just come out.”
Starting at 8 p.m., people made 
their way down to the floor and began dancing at about 9:30 p.m. Shoes were abandoned in piles by the bleachers, and dancers young and old started spinning and swing-ing their arms.Garba involves a series of re-
petitive motions performed while dancers move in circles around the floor. Some circles spun clockwise and others counter-clockwise, some were big and others small. Though the steps may have been simple, the performance as a whole looked in-tricate and complicated.
As the night wore on, the tempo 
of the music increased. The dancers sped up, performing jumping move-ments rather than sweeping steps.
Roshini Pudhucode, an 18-year-
old biomedical engineering fresh-man, taught Zach Smythurst, an 18-year-old mechanical engineering freshman, and his friends.
“It seems pretty easy ,” Smythurst 
said. “It’s a new experience, but it’s not overwhelming.”
Ten-piece band Taare Zameen 
Par provided the traditional tunes for the evening, playing nearly all night.
Attendees prepared for the raas 
by grabbing their dandiyas, foot-long sticks usually made of wood and decorated with paint, colored tape and fabric.
Shah said she was happy to have 
participated in this event.
“It was a lot of work, but it’s so 
worth it in the end,” she said.

A collaborative study between UF re-
searchers and a Florida State University pa-
leobiologist has scientists chewing on new ideas about dinosaur study.
The study, published this month in the 
journal “Science,” found that the teeth of the hadrosaurid — a Late Cretaceous-period herbivore with a duck-like bill — are com-posed of six layers of tissue instead of the two layers expected in typical reptile dental structures, according to a news release.
This means dinosaur teeth are much more 
complex than previously thought, said UF postdoctoral researcher Brandon Krick.
One of the processes that made the break-
through, rarely used on fossils, Krick said, involves scratching the material with a diamond-tipped tool to measure how it re-sponds to abrasion.
The research team ran preliminary tests 
showing the tooth’s high mineral content had preserved the structures they wanted to explore further.
The lab instruments used in the study 
were designed and built by UF students, Krick said.
Krick said the team found that the six tis-
sue types contained in the tooth displayed different levels of resistance to abrasion. 
The results help scientists understand the 
biomechanics of hadrosaurids as “grinders,” similar to bison and other grazing animals.
“They’re like the horses of the dinosaur 
period,” Krick said.
He said the results open up new avenues 
for discovering the tissue properties of other fossils through mechanical tests.
“Paleontologists will have new ideas on 
testing to learn about the biomechanics of these animals,” Krick said.Scientists study dinosaur teethDANIELLE BOYD

In the cool darkness of the Hippo-
drome State Theatre, Violet spread her 
wings for her captivated audience.
About 100 people stumbled in and out 
of the dim theater Saturday to see Violet, a 21-year-old bat, and Edgar, a Rodrigues fruit bat, for an event hosted by the Lubee Bat Conservancy.
The event, meant to raise awareness 
for endangered bats, is the first time the theater and the conservancy teamed up to prevent the extinction of bats and in-form the Gainesville community about conservation.
People sat quietly in the theater as 
two documentaries played about bat mi-gration and conservation. Then, the bats were carried into the theater, and one bat was taken out for the visitors to admire.
“I thought the event was excellent. 
Brian gave an excellent presentation, and I know he reached a lot of people with it,” said Gainesville resident Amber Roux.
The Lubee Bat Conservancy is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1989 and extends to 19 coun-tries and multiple nonprofits. Its mission is to preserve the vital need of nature’s bats, said Brian Pope, director of the Lu-bee Bat Conservancy.
There are 1,250 bat species worldwide, 
and the conservancy houses 67 of them. It is home to 208 bats and is open to the public only once a year during the annual Florida Bat Festival, Pope said.
“I am so glad we are getting the inter -
est of local communities, I want people to see how cool these amazing creatures are,” he said.
Jacqueline Meyer, 62-year-old Wash-
ington, D.C. resident, said she enjoyed learning about how the conservancy protects the bats during her visit to Gainesville.

62-year-old Washington, D.C. resident� KEEGAN HONES WON THIRD PLACE 
IN A WRITING CONTEST.
ALEX CATALANO
Alligator Staff Writer
Erica Merrell opened an envelope and 
found a blessing.
Inside, she found a letter explaining that a 
young man had won an award, which came 
in the form of the envelope’s second item: a check for $250 made out to her bookstore.
Wild Iris, the feminist bookstore Merrell co-
owns with Santa Fe College professor Cheryl Calhoun, needed the money and attention. About $20,000 of debt for an abandoned cafe and increased rent payments could soon force the store out of its colorful shell at 802 W. Uni-versity Ave.
But the award winner, Keegan Hones, is 
improving the situation. About a year ago, he noticed a writing contest on James Patterson’s Facebook page.
The 18-year-old biology freshman at UF 
was a high school senior when he submitted an essay about Tim Tebow’s book “Through My Eyes,” and it earned him a third place award.
The prizes ranged from $250 to $1,000. Last 
year, the American Booksellers Association awarded 235 prizes in all, said content officer Dan Cullen.
He said the program really reflects Pat-
terson’s convictions to literacy, especially in kids.
“It gives kids the opportunity to go into 
their local bookseller to browse and discover and make purchases of their own,” Cullen said.
Hones’ winnings could be used at any store 
associated with IndieBound, a nonprofit or -
ganization that links authors and booksellers with independent shops and local businesses.
He chose Wild Iris.Hones now has a line of credit that will let 
him spend the $250 on anything from text-books to bumper stickers.
The money comes at a good time. Merrell said Wild Iris’ financial situation 
forces it to seek out a cheaper location. It’s gotten to the point that the co-owners have opened a donation drive.
“It’s going to help us find a new space and 
pay off some of the debt the store has accu-mulated,” Merrell said. “We just need some help.”
She said it’s rough for independent stores 
to compete with retailers like Amazon.com, but she stays hopeful with the support of the community — including people like Hones.
“It’s cool to help out a locally owned store 
because they just get overlooked so much,” he said.MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

The UF Cancer and Genetics Research Complex 
lawn became a sea of pink Saturday , covered with 
the glitter, sequins and feathers that adorned hand-painted pumpkins.
Hundreds of people attended Shands at UF’s first 
Pink Pumpkin Fest, which included events like a Pink Pumpkin Pedal-Off, Pink Pumpkin Painting Party and about 20 other exhibits aimed at raising money and awareness for breast cancer.
“They’ve made this event fun so that even kids 
can participate and start learning about it,” said Lisa Bynes, 37, after securing two feathers to the stem of her silver pumpkin.
Lindsey Wuest, a 21-year-old advertising senior 
and volunteer for Shands at UF’s Arts in Medicine program, said she felt the painted pumpkins would serve as a cute reminder of hope and healing.
Kelsey Tainsh wore a pink button displaying the 
words  “FIGHT CURE WIN” in bold black letters. The 22-year-old recreation and event management senior said she is a two-time pediatric cancer survivor.
Doctors successfully removed a brain tumor from 
Tainsh when she was 5 years old, she said. The cancer came back when she was 15, but this time, she suf-fered a stroke. She said she had to learn how to walk and talk again, but she’s always been a believer.
When Tainsh decorated her pink pumpkin Satur -
day, she glued a large breast cancer ribbon in the cen-ter with two small silver stars. She attached colored letters, spelling out “I beat cancer twice.”
“Almost everyone in the world faces cancer, 
whether it’s directly or indirectly,” Tainsh said. “It’s great to see people unite in support of breast cancer [awareness] with Shands.”Residents paint

ing butterfly costumes, carving pump-
kins and tasting honey — attended the Florida Museum of Natural History’s seventh annual ButterflyFest this week-end.
About 500 native Florida butterflies 
were released during the event. 
There was also a plant sale on the 
front lawn of the cultural plaza. 
Florida Museum of Natural History’s 
public programs coordinator Catherine Carey said the most popular plant was milkweed.
“The plant sale is aimed at encourag-
ing more sustainable landscaping and wildlife-friendly landscaping,” said Jar -
et Daniels, the McGuire Center assistant curator of Lepidoptera.
Another event was the Pollinator Photography contest award ceremony, during which Chappie McChesney, founder of the Alachua County Bee-keepers Club, won first place in the adult division. 
Volunteers became roving "pollina-
tors," asking children trivia questions and rewarding them with hand stamps.
McGuire Center research associate 
Tom Neal said he was amazed by the number of people he spoke with at the festival who had never touched an in-sect.

The construct of fun: or, Derrida defended
There are two types of people in the world.
Actually, there are many more than that.
My mistake, I miscounted. I’m an English major.
What I was going to do, before math so rudely interrupt-
ed, is try to describe for you the main differences between the people who go to downtown and the people who go to Midtown. (I live at Three-Quarters-town so I consider my-self uniquely qualiﬁ  ed for this assignment.)
This is an extreme oversimpliﬁ  cation (which is, coinci-
dentally, my favorite kind of oversimpliﬁ  cation).
You see, Midtown is a place for, for lack of a better word, 
“partying.” By partying, I don’t just mean in the traditional sense of getting drunk, losing your car keys and sleeping on somebody’s bathroom ﬂ  oor with a roll of toilet paper for a pillow. (Although, that can certainly result from going to Midtown.)
The atmosphere in Midtown is a sort of pseudo-classy , 
peppy, dance-till-you-drop-then-breakdance exuberance.
Everybody there is simply so happy!The obvious downside is the cramped spaces and sweat 
in your eyeballs from some tall dude lifting his arms up while you’re standing next to him during that one Drake song (you know, “Für Elise”). But those are minimal as long as you have the money to pay the covers and buy overpriced drinks and hop from club to club until it’s 3 a.m., you’re screaming and your voice is straining.
Downtown is slightly different.Where Midtown is exciting, downtown is more laid back. 
That is not to say downtown is less booze-drenched — the crowd in downtown is much more interested in alcohol, es-pecially beer, than is the Midtown crowd.
Midtown is a place for happy people to go and keep be-
ing happy , because YOLO! Downtown is a place for more world-weary people to go and drink because life is like that joke from Annie Hall (the one where two women are staying at a resort in the Catskills and one says “Man, the food here sucks” and the other says “Yes, and such small portions!”). Downtown is more of a place for introspection. Midtown is for extrospection. Is that a word? I feel like it should be.  That is, the scene in Midtown 
is based on a conception of “fun” that involves dancing to some song you’ve heard on the radio 300 times simply because you have heard that song on the radio 300 times, and that makes it awe-some.
That conception of fun is over-
whelmingly dominant in contemporary American society . In it, the signiﬁ  er “fun” is encoded with its normal meaning of something like “a feeling of enjoyment” but also links to sig-niﬁ  ers like “dancing to dubstep,” “amusement parks,” “so-cial gatherings” and, more generally , “interaction with giant groups of people who have similar conceptions of fun.”
This is not inherently bad. It is a conception that has 
passed into our culture through mass media — Jersey Shore and the advertising industry have had a large hand in this enterprise.
But it has resulted in an entire culture of people who can’t 
be convinced of the relative value of a party/song/dance/book/religion without being reassured that a bunch of other people also think that it’s good — which is, in and of itself, problematic.
I don’t mean to be “that guy,” who stands up on a soap-
box wearing two pairs of ﬂ  annel pajama pants and no shirt, moaning about “sheeple,” because I’m so much better than you with my cool hipster ways.
I like following the crowd, too. It’s fun! There are a lot of 
people there, and a lot of them are really cool!
But there are some times when it’s all right that nobody 
comes to your party , so you end up drinking hot beer on the porch and yelling about deconstructionism at passers-by alone. That’s pretty fun, too!
If you want it to be, anything can be fun. That, dear friends, is why you should read Derrida. I’m 
serious! It’s fun!

Red Bull’s space attempt
almost a good idea
What are you afraid of?
Spiders creep out some people. Think about it: 
eight legs to walk on you, eight eyes to spy on you.
Many people are afraid of heights to the extent they fear be-
ing lifted off the ground by their friends, because who knows 
what will happen if they were to fall.
Felix Baumgartner is deﬁ  nitely not afraid of heights. After an 
attempt last week that was canceled due to heavy winds, Baum-gartner fell from a height of about 23 miles Sunday afternoon over New Mexico.
Before you get too concerned for his mental sanity , he’s an 
Austrian daredevil, so he’s used to doing stunts that scare others easily . He’s a 43-year-old former military parachutist. He’s also a badass.
The event was streamed live on YouTube, as this was a gi-
ant publicity stunt hosted by Red Bull. It would be nice to have millions of dollars to blow on an opportunity like this. Although it was streamed live, there was a 20-second delay , just in case something absolutely tragic happened.
Were you one of the about 7.3 million people who tuned in 
online to watch this insane feat? We were too afraid to watch the whole thing.
Baumgartner promised, according to the Washington Post, 
that this would be his ﬁ  nal jump in his high-diving/sky-diving stunt career. And thank goodness for that.
This seems like a kind of silly thing to waste a lot of money 
on, but maybe that’s how people feel about space travel in gen-eral. Is it that kind of attitude that got rid of some funding for the space program recently? Do people think that it’s not worth further exploration?
Granted, space exploration is a much more legitimate ex-
pense than a daredevil wanting to break not only world records but also the speed of sound. Something to note: His stunt was on the 65th anniversary of Chuck Yeager’s attempt to be the ﬁ  rst man to break the sound barrier in an airplane.
Red Bull has the money, we suppose, to promote and pay for 
something this extraordinary . Couldn’t they have just donated it to the space program without threatening somebody’s life? That probably takes all the fun out of it. High risk means high reward.
A stunt, or a feat or whatever you want to call it, shouldn’t 
receive more attention for its craziness than the space program gets. While what Baumgartner did is very cool, it almost seems like a waste. The company will not release how much the stunt cost in total, but the balloon that took Baumgartner up last week during the ﬁ  rst attempt cost $70,000. That doesn’t include the astronaut-like suit Baumgartner had to wear or the technology it took to ensure his safety during those trips.
This earned Red Bull a great amount of attention and pub-
licity; they’ve been planning this event with Baumgartner since 2005.
Next time, try spending that much money on a smarter cause, 
maybe?
We hear PBS might be in trouble.

This election cycle, there has been a lot of talk about 
various election laws that have passed and will af-fect voters this November. However, one issue that 
has yet to take in the national spotlight is early voting. During the 2008 election, Barack Obama was able to win various key states and the presidency because, in large part, he cinched a large portion of early voters who voted by mail or in person.
Early voting allows citizens to vote before Election 
Day, usually to accommodate out-of-state residents, such as college students, or those who will be unable to vote on the inconvenient Tuesday Election Day . In addition, as college students, some of us decide to vote in our home states as opposed to registering in New Hampshire. The absentee ballots that we send in are received about a month before Election Day. Though these ballots aren’t counted until Nov . 6, they still have a significant impact on election dynamics.
During the 2008 election, President Obama accrued so 
many votes during the early voting period in North Caro-lina that, although he lost the Election Day popular vote, he was able to secure the state’s electoral votes. Though most of these early votes aren’t a month in advance, with some states having early voting periods the weekend be-fore the election, there is something to be said about the impact early voting has.
Voting dynamics are, in large part, influenced by the 
specific socioeconomic groups that can vote. For example, for some people who work odd hours or double shifts, scheduling Election Day on a weekday hinders their abil-ity to cast a vote. The fact that most Election Days around 
the world don’t occur during the week attests to the fact that our election calendar is antiquated.
The decision to hold elections 
on a Tuesday is based on our 
agrarian history . When the majority of Americans were farmers and needed a day to get to the polls, it seemed convenient to place Election Day on the day before mar -
ket day , so farmers could harvest their crops and then go to town to sell their crops and vote.
In modern times, Americans are increasingly located 
in cities, and polling places have become more easily ac-cessible to most Americans, which makes this out-of-date procedure more inconvenient than anything else. In a country where 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. jobs are extremely com-mon and voting on a Tuesday is physically impossible for some, this choice may inadvertently serve to disenfran-chise a select few.
Early voting is a solution to this problem because it ac-
commodates Americans who otherwise could not vote, either because of the aforementioned obstacle or because, like us college students, they temporarily reside in an-other state.
With this in mind, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals 
recently overturned an Ohio law allowing only military personnel to participate in early voting. The court stated that all voters must be treated equally under Ohio law and that allowing early voting for some residents requires that it must be allowed for all.
Proponents of the law claimed that because military 
personnel could be deployed at any time, they deserved special privileges in terms of when they could vote. Al-though this point is true, when it comes to voting, any incapacity is equally legitimate. Whether deployed to foreign soil or unable to vote because of the necessity to work to provide for one’s own family , the incapacity is the same and results in the same inability to participate in the voting process. Therefore, early voting must be applied equally to all residents of a state and county.
A change in one factor or one aspect of the voting pro-
cess, such as early voting, can have systemic effects that alter the nature of the election and voter dynamics. The exact nature of these effects is unknown in the best case, or intended in the worst and, therefore, should be avoided at all costs to prevent any form of unlawful or unfair tam-pering with elections.

UWireFour years ago, during the 2008 election cycle, 
voters in Alachua County voted “yes” on the One Mill Ad Valorem Tax, a property fee levied 
against homeowners in Alachua County that is used to directly provide funding to schools’ nurses, elementary art and music programs, K-12 school library programs, K-12 guidance programs, classroom technology, school magnet programs and high school band and chorus pro-grams. This voting initiative, which expires in 2013, will be put to a vote again this election cycle, and I am writ-ing to urge voters to vote “yes” on this imperative rev-enue source used to fund our school programs, which in turn make our community stronger.
Nobody likes taxes — myself included. However, 
due to the fragile nature of the economy and necessary budget cuts, the funding of these vital school programs has become more difficult to fund due to shrinking state coffers. According to Alachua County Public Schools, since 2008, per-student funding has decreased from $4,684 a student to $3,328 a student — a 29 percent de-crease. This property fee, which is not a new tax but a renewal of an existing tax, would be used to fill the gap left by these budget cuts so that these programs, as well as the staff that runs them, continue to operate at cur -
rent levels.  
Another point worth noting is that the One Mill pro-
gram is not a tax increase but is equal to $1 taxed for every $1,000 of the taxable value of property in Ala-chua County. If you use $150,000, the average value of a home in Alachua County, as a baseline, it is roughly $15 a month per household — a very manageable sum, considering that it will keep your children involved in worthwhile after-school programs that help strengthen the public. To prevent waste, this program is also over -
seen by an independent citizen’s committee that makes sure that your tax dollars are spent to directly support these platforms instead of to fund a government bu-reaucracy.
Some voters might feel urged to vote “no” on this 
key ballot initiative, thinking that they have a moral ob-ligation to vote “no” because they do not own property in Alachua County and, therefore, should not make de-cisions about other citizens’ property values and taxes. To this, I say that school music and art programs cre-ate more creative, wholesome children and transform them into better leaders for tomorrow. They create a stronger, more thriving community within Alachua County. Many social studies have linked participation in music and art programs to bet-ter grades in children’s academ-ics, as well as fewer disciplinary problems at school and at home.  If voters choose to shoot the One Mill initiative down, layoffs of 
art and music teachers will directly result, and many schools will lose their fine arts programs all together.  This would be a serious blow to the children of Alachua County.
This initiative was shot down by voters in Marion 
County in August, and I do not want the same thing to happen in Alachua County. The community cannot af-ford an environment in which the fine arts do not flour -
ish.  
I am a lifelong musician, and I can speak from expe-
rience: Music has changed who I am today for the better and made me a better man academically and creatively.  Please do not deprive Alachua County children of the opportunity that we received as children when we were growing up. When you mail in your absentee ballot or go to your voting precinct Nov. 6, please vote “yes” to renew the existing One Mill Ad Valorem Tax for School District Operating Expenses. A copy of the actual ballot language of this initiative can be found below.  
BALLOT TITLE:RENEWAL OF THE EXISTING ONE MILL AD V A-
LOREM TAX FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT OPERATING EXPENSES
BALLOT QUESTION:
Shall the Alachua County School District’s existing 
one mill ad valorem tax be renewed, beginning July 1, 
2013, and ending four years later on June 30, 2017, for necessary operating expenses to fund school nurses, el-ementary music and art programs, K-12 school library programs, K-12 guidance programs, middle and high school band and chorus programs, academic/career technical magnet programs and to update classroom technology; with oversight by and independent citi-zens’ committee?

Speaking Outlos Aguilar, 45, said. “At that mo-
ment, we’re going to have the honor of taking Christian back home.”
On Saturday, Levy County dep-
uty sheriffs blocked off dirt roads leading into the woods along State Road 24, as police combed through the area to gather more evidence.
Jeff Baxman, a 60-year-old truck 
driver, lives several miles away from where the body was found.
The dozens 
of police officers 
driving into the woods, including a forensics team, surprised Bax-man on his way home from Mi-ami Friday night.
“This doesn’t 
happen out here a lot,” he said.
The search for Christian Aguilar 
began 25 days ago, when he was re-ported missing.
The Aguilars drove almost 350 
miles from Miami to look for their son, combing through swamps and woods throughout Gainesville.
However, they did not look 
alone.
Supporters from Miami, 
Gainesville and across the state as-sisted the Aguilars and GPD in the search.As days turned to weeks, and 
Christian Aguilar remained miss-ing, police turned the search into a recovery mission.
Kathy Tamargo was one of the 
dozens of UF students who volun-teered with police.
The 20-year-old political sci-
ence senior said she searched along Southwest 13th Street Oct. 7 for clues.
“If it was your brother, you’d 
want people helping out, too,” she said.
During the investigation, police 
named Pedro Bravo the main sus-pect in Aguilar’s disappearance.
Bravo, an 18-year-old Santa Fe 
College student and Aguilar’s for -
mer friend, told GPD detectives he beat Aguilar and left him lying on the ground.
In the past few weeks, police 
found several pieces of evidence: blood inside Bravo’s 2004 Chevro-let Trailblazer, Aguilar’s backpack in Bravo’s closet and a receipt on Bravo’s dresser. 
The receipt showed he had pur -
chased a roll of duct tape and a shovel several days before Aguilar’s disappearance.
Bravo has been in Alachua 
County Jail since Sept. 24, where he remains in custody without bond.
On Oct. 8, an Alachua County 
grand jury indicted Bravo on kid-napping and first-degree murder charges.
Bravo’s next appearance in court 
will be his arraignment Oct. 24, where he will appear in front of a judge and make his plea in the case.
Although a body has been found, Ron Kozlowski, one of the attorneys representing Bravo and his fam-ily , said his team is still working on strategies for the defense.
If police confirm the body to 
be Aguilar, he said, the case can change.
“How it changes is really specu-
lation,” he said. “We just don’t know enough.”

Sunday afternoon. The event had a children’s section called Imagination Station.
Pedro Bravo will appear in court to make his plea on Oct. 24
AguilAr , from page 1
The festival featured new artists, totaling 250 artists and vendors
area, and some pushed relatives in wheel-
chairs and strollers.
Dogs scampered next to their owners, 
stopping to sniff a stand or greet another canine companion.
One section of the festival, called 
Imagination Station, offered activities for children such as finger painting, crafting, magic shows and an inflatable slide.
Adults paused as they walked through 
the festival, peering into the tents of the about 250 artists and vendors who set up tents for the weekend.
The artwork was as eclectic as the peo-
ple who came to the event.
Large, steel statues stood 5-feet tall, 
while the soft clanging of windchimes echoed in the distance. Paintings of all genres hung on canvassed walls next to their proud creators.
This year, 35 new artists showcased 
their work.
One of those new faces, William Kidd 
from Myanmar, won best-in-show for his ceramic sculptures.
Most of the work in his tent looked like 
alien, plant-like forms.
“They’re organically inspired,” Kidd said. “I’ll look at things like coral reefs, seeds, spores and cacti. I don’t want to duplicate them, but they influence my work.”
Though Kidd said he enjoyed the 
weather and the atmosphere, he said he heard other artists gossiping about lower attendance at the festival this year.
But some long-time visitors to the event 
said the crowd was the biggest they could remember.
“This year has been one of the smooth-
est,” said Dani Skaja, who said she attend-ed the festival the past 13 years. “It just gets bigger and bigger every year.”
Skaja and her husband, John, said they 
love the atmosphere of the event and see-ing new artists.
She also said she loved the smell of the 
fair food that was sold around the festival, though she couldn’t eat most of it.
“The food is always a draw,” she said, 
“even though we’re vegan.”

“I hope we move in that direction soon,” Crist said.
The governors also discussed imposing a sales tax on on-
line vendors like Amazon.
Graham said a sales tax should be imposed for online 
vendors. Martinez agreed, saying it would damage physical retailers in Florida.
Before the governors ended their conversation, they ad-dressed all the students in the room.
Askew told them they cannot allow 
themselves to be cynical.
“You have to look upon politics as an 
honorable profession,” he said.
Graham encouraged students to have 
as many life experiences as possible.
Martinez told students to be specialists 
in their fields but generalists in the rest of 
their lives.“Don’t get yourself too narrow in view you can’t see 
someone else’s needs,” he said.
MacKay told everyone that when looking back, the things 
that seemed important, aren’t.
Crist told students to be good listeners, be civil and partic-
ipate. Dillon McCarthy, a 21-year-old first-year law student, said it was “rare to see five former governors in one place.”
“The most pleasant thing [was] to have them talk about 
and apply knowledge they’ve seen from their life,” he said.

Devan Baird has been a dragon-wielding 
warrior princess determined to rule seven 
kingdoms with fire and blood, a giggling mass murderer with a split personality, and a purple-haired unicorn with an eye for fashion and all things fabulous.
The 21-year-old telecommunication se-
nior creates costumes of her favorite charac-ters from TV, anime and comic books in an art form called cosplay.
She has competed with her hand-sewn 
outfits across the southeastern United States since 2010.
Cosplay, short for costume play, is the 
Japanese art of dressing up as characters from anime, comics and television.
“Cosplay is a way to represent charac-
ters you really care about,” Baird said. “It’s dressing up and embodying the spirit of the character to get in touch with who they are, essentially.”
The anime and cosplay community will 
always be close to her heart, and she hopes to put her telecommunication degree to work in the animation industry after she graduates in Spring, Baird said.
Inside her closet lay the mix-matched 
parts of about 10 costumes. Among the visi-ble outfits are Misty from “Pokémon,” Daen-erys Targaryen from “Game of Thrones” and Rarity from “My Little Pony.”
She went — in costume — to cosplay 
contests at anime conventions, but she nev-er entertained the thought of competing. She said she still felt like an amateur.
Eventually, with the encouragement of 
her friends and family, she mustered up the confidence to enter her first cosplay contest at 2010 EXPcon.
“It was terrifying,” Baird said. “It took a 
lot of convincing by my friends to actually do it.”
Competitors in a cosplay contest are 
judged on costume difficulty, design savvy and overall presentation. Prizes differ for every contest, but rewards can fall any-where from $10 to $500.
Though she didn’t place, she said she fell 
in love with the competition and the idea of her hard work on display.
After her first experience, Baird regular -
ly entered cosplay competitions across the southeast.
She placed best in show at Florida State 
University’s 2011 Freecon, won best indi-vidual cosplay at the 2011 Florida Anime Experience and won second place in the group hallway contest at the 2012 Metro-con, all with different cosplays.
Baird has been featured on costume 
blogs and in COStume MODE Magazine, a Japanese publication dedicated to cosplay.
Baird’s creative process usually contains four steps. 
She first finds as many pictures as possi-
ble that reference the character and specific costume she wants to make.
After she analyzes every detail of the 
outfit, she tries to find a fabric pattern simi-lar to the original.
Baird said it’s typical to combine sev-
eral patterns or to design a pattern from scratch.
Fabric and pattern in hand, she’ll spend 
the next few weeks sewing and hot gluing her creation to perfection.
“I cosplay not only to connect with the 
character but also to make friends and be a part of a community that doesn’t define what we’re doing as weird,” Baird said. “We define it as coming together as a com-munity to be passionate about something.”Baird isn’t the only one in her family who 
likes to wear neon-colored wigs.
Emma Baird, 16, was inspired by her 
older sister to start cosplaying.
The Eastside High School junior has six 
cosplays under her belt.
“I thought, ‘Wow, she is gorgeous,’” 
Emma said. “I wish I was that good or dedi-cated.”
The two have attended conventions to-
gether, but Emma hasn’t competed.
Their road trip this summer to Anime 
Festival Orlando was Emma’s favorite.
The sisters bonded over cosplaying, 
shopping for memorabilia and goofing around with each other.
The sisters help each other when they 
can; lending wigs or costume pieces to each other and giving patience and support.
Their parents encourage both of them to 
cosplay and do what makes them happy.
“They never thought it was weird,” Baird 
said. “They’ve always just tried to help.”
Baird had strutted down the competition 
catwalk and sat in the audience chairs of countless conventions but had never stood behind a judge’s podium — at least until January.
She volunteered to be cosplay coordina-
tor of SwampCon, a multigenre convention at UF hosted by the student organizations Gator Anime, Gator Gaming, Delta Nu Delta Tabletop Gaming and Science Fiction Consortium.
Baird plans to expand SwampCon’s 2013 
cosplay programming by adding a hall-way contest, which is a competition during which photos of cosplayers are posted and convention attendees vote on their favorites. Hallway cosplay contests are more demo-cratic and friendlier to novice cosplayers.
She strives to make competitive cosplay-
ing within the grasp of anyone who wants to give it a try.
Baird intends competitive cosplay to be 
a life-long ambition. The only reason she would stop cosplaying is a lack of resources like time or money, Baird said.
“I really love it, and I would like to share 
the love,” Baird said.MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

ESPN College Gameday will air live from Gainesville 
ahead of Saturday’s game between Florida and South Carolina in The Swamp. Kickoff is at 3:30 p.m. on CBS. Gators No. 2 in First BCS Standings
The BCS standings debuted on Sunday, with the Gators ranked No. 2. Alabama is No. 1. Oregon, Kansas State and Notre Dame round out the top ﬁ  ve. The computer average had UF ranked No. 1. Junior middle blocker Chloe Mann led UF in kills and blocks as the Gators’ defense earned them a win. See story, page 14.

  NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The 
Gators’ skill position players did 
less on Saturday than they had in any game all season, but Jeff Driskel made sure it didn’t matter.
  The sophomore racked up 177 
yards on the ground, breaking Tim Tebow’s UF record for rushing yards in a game by a quarterback as No. 3 Florida (6-0, 5-0 Southeastern Conference) defeated Vanderbilt 31-17.
  “I don’t know that he surprises 
anybody at this point in the sea-son,” coach Will Muschamp said of Driskel. “But he is really fast.”
  With the win, the Gators took 
sole possession of ﬁ  rst place in the SEC East as they look toward next Saturday’s game against No. 9 South Carolina.
  The Commodores (2-4, 1-3 SEC) 
held UF’s leading rusher, Mike Gil-lislee, to 67 yards on 17 carries — his lowest yards per carry average of the season. No Gator had more than 21 yards receiving. The Florida passing game was held to less than 100 yards for the second straight week. But Driskel provided plenty of ﬁ  repower with his legs, running the ball 11 times for 177 yards and three touchdowns.
  Tebow previously set the rush-
ing record for a Florida quarterback with 166 yards on 27 carries in Flori-da’s 30-24 win at Ole Miss in 2007.
  Driskel consistently found room 
to run against the Commodores as offensive coordinator Brent Pease called several read option plays.
  “They were keying in on Gil-
lislee all night, which they should,” Driskel said. “He’s had a great sea-son. When two or three guys go for him, it opens up lanes.”
  The Commodores did not ad-
just to defend the option, even after Driskel had already accumulated 107 yards on the ground. So Pease called it again to begin UF’s drive with 2:31 remaining in the game after Vanderbilt cut the lead to 24-17. Driskel took the ball around the right side and outran the Com-modores’ secondary for a 70-yard touchdown — the longest run of his career and his third score of the game.
  “If something is working, keep 
going to it, so that’s really what we did,” Driskel said.
  Muschamp said he understood 
why Vanderbilt’s defense took the approach it did, but he knew Flor-ida would have the opportunity to STAYING GROUNDED

 NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The 
Gators have been quick to coin new 
mantras this season.
  After the injury bug swept 
through UF during Saturday’s 31-17 win against Vanderbilt, redshirt senior Sam Robey added another: “Adapt, overcome, improvise.”
  At least 10 players left due to in-
jury in a road Southeastern Confer-ence game, including two starting offensive linemen. Not included in that total are left guard James Wil-son and linebacker Jelani Jenkins, who didn’t even make it to kickoff.
  Wilson suffered an eye injury on Wednesday during practice and couldn’t make the trip. Coach Will Muschamp expects him back on Tuesday.
  Ian Silberman made his ﬁ  rst ca-
reer start in Wil-son’s place.
  Center Jonot-
than Harrison injured his right arm on the Gators’ ﬁ  rst drive. Robey re-
placed Harrison at center.
  D.J. Humphries took over at left 
tackle for Xavier Nixon, who left the game in the ﬁ  rst half with an upper Reserves step up on line THE END OF GREGULATION
  NASHVILLE, TENN.Florida won again, and as usual it wasn’t 
pretty.
  Against what should have been a clearly 
overmatched Vanderbilt team, UF looked beat-able. The Commodores took an early lead and only narrowly lost the total yardage battle as Jeff Driskel failed to pass for even 100 yards for the second week in a row.
  Facing No. 9 South Carolina next weekend, 
it’d be easy to write things like, “Florida won’t be able to win if it can’t pass,” and “The Gators’ ef-fort won’t get it done against the Gamecocks.”
  But you know what? It probably will. No 
matter how unimpressive Florida continually is against unranked opponents, it doesn’t matter. There’s no debating the fact: This is one of the best teams in college football.
  Whether it’s because talent is more balanced, 
or the Southeastern Conference is down, or the entire NCAA is down, this uninspiring Florida team is one of the best anywhere.
  South Carolina should be a challenge, but a 23-21 loss at LSU makes the Gamecocks look like a favorable matchup. The Tigers — who the Gators beat just a week ago — won despite an ugly pass-ing game by racking up 258 yards on the 
ground. LSU attempted only two passes while running the ball 15 times in the fourth quarter. If that’s the formula to beat South Carolina, then Florida should be a substantial favorite.
  So then what remaining game will Florida be 
the underdog in? Will UF not be a favorite against the Georgia team that got blown out by South Carolina? Is Florida really in trouble against the Florida State squad that just lost to N.C. State?
  This isn’t a prediction that UF will run the ta-
ble. The Gators proved with their performance on Saturday that, on a bad day, they could lose just UF not great, but can win it all

Driskel sets Gators record  ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

  The Gators have been a strong 
second-half team this season. For 
10 minutes on Sunday,  Missis-sippi State looked like it may put an end to that trend.
  Florida came out of the locker 
room after halftime with a 1-0 lead, but the Bulldogs scored two minutes into the half and looked to have control of the match.
  “It was just a matter of us really 
not doing what we do well, which is keep the ball, play it and move,” coach Becky Burleigh said.
  But after that 10-minute lapse, 
Florida (12-3-1, 9-1 Southeastern Conference) got its offense back on track and scored three unanswered goals in a 4-1 win against Missis-sippi State (8-8-1, 1-8-1 SEC).
  Sunday was Senior Day for the Gators, and the seniors owned the spotlight.
  After being honored with their 
families on the ﬁ  eld before the game, seniors McKenzie Barney, Erika Tymrak and Jo Dragotta ac-counted for all four of Florida’s goals.
  Barney opened the scoring in 
the ﬁ  fth minute off a pass from Tymrak, netting the earliest Gators goal of the season.
  Florida wouldn’t score again for 
another 66 minutes. In that time, Mississippi State tied the game and controlled possession early in the second half.
  With the game tied at one in the 
71st minute, Dragotta received the ball well outside the box and shot a laser into the upper right corner of the goal.
  Six minutes later, Tymrak add-
ed insurance to the Gators’ lead when she scored on a free kick just outside of the penalty box. 
  “I saw probably a 4-foot gap be-
tween the wall and the post, and the keeper was kind of 
behind the wall,” Tymrak said. “I basically just focused on hitting the spot.”
  Dragotta scored the ﬁ  nal goal 
in the 81st minute after freshman Claire Falknor was fouled by Bull-dogs goalkeeper Skylar Rosson. Rosson was given a red card and left the game, and Dragotta scored on the penalty kick against backup keeper CJ Winship. 
  After entering the season with-
out a goal in her career, Dragotta has scored ﬁ  ve times in the past seven games. 
  Dragotta’s ﬁ  ve goals tie sopho-
more Havana Solaun and Barney for the team lead. 
Still, Dragotta is never quite 
sure how to react when the ball hits the net.
  “I kind of just scream every 
time, because I don’t really know what to do,” Dragotta said. 14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2012

 Even as Chloe Mann tied 
her career high with 20 kills in 
just three sets, the Gators’ de-fense stole the show.
  No. 11 Florida (15-2, 9-0 
Southeastern Conference) blocked and dug its way past Auburn on Sunday in the O’Connell Center to earn its 10th sweep of the season (25-19, 25-19, 25-15). For the fourth straight match, the Gators notched at least 10 team blocks, and they had three players notch nine digs or more.
  Coach Mary Wise said 
many of her team’s mistakes on the offensive side of the ball, such as passing errors, were masked by UF’s blocking effort. 
Florida’s 10 blocks on Sun-
day were 2.5 more blocks than its season average in three-set matches.
  Mann led the team both 
offensively with 20 kills and defensively with seven blocks against Auburn (13-6, 4-5 SEC).
  “The blocking makes up 
for mistakes,” Wise said. “Not even the stuff blocks, just the control blocks or at least fun-neling the balls. The play-ers in this league are just too big, too physical that you’ve got to block balls to have any chance.”
  Florida held Auburn to a 
sub-.300 hitting percentage in the ﬁ  rst two sets. UF remains undefeated when holding op-ponents below that mark for an entire match. 
However, Wise’s defense 
buckled down even more in the third and ﬁ  nal set, limit-ing the Tigers to an .029 hitting clip.
  Sophomore defensive spe-
cialist Madison Monserez’s nine digs marked the second most among Gators. Sopho-more Taylor Unroe led the way with 11 digs, while fresh-man Ziva Recek added nine. 
  Monserez said Florida’s 
blocking and positioning aided her defensive effort.
  “They were in the right 
spots, so it was easy for us to line up 
behind it, and I think that was a big part of the defense today,” she 
said. “Deﬁ  nitely the blocking helped today.”
  The Gators are 6-0 when 
registering 10 or more blocks in a match.
  Senior middle blocker Betsy 
Smith, whose 38 blocks on the year rank third for UF, said Florida’s recent play at the net is due to increased comfort with Wise’s scheme.
  “It is getting used to our 
game plans and knowing what we’re supposed to do, and really buying into them and knowing what their hitters are doing before they even know what they’re doing,” Smith said. “It’s a lot more cerebral than you would think.”

The sophomore didn’t 
do much through the air, but his 177 rushing yards broke a school-
record of 166 yards by a quarterback set by Tim Tebow in 2007. Driskel also ran for a career-high three touchdowns.
Facing fourth and 5 with a four-point lead midway through the third quarter, coach Will Mus-
champ decided to gamble. After Florida lined up in a punt formation, Solomon Patton took a handoff 54 yards up the sideline to Vanderbilt’s 3. Two plays later, UF extended its lead to 18-7.326
The Gators had a ﬁ  eld day in the ground 
game against the Commodores, amassing

Guard Ian Silberman (77) blocks on a pass attempt during Florida’s 
31-17 win against Vanderbilt on Saturday at Vanderbilt Stadium.
Muschamp impressed by performance of Gators’ backup linemen 
body injury.
“It was definitely a domino ef-
fect at first,” Robey said. “But I 
mean shoot, we still had two or three more guys on the sideline ready to go.”
Despite the injuries along the 
offensive line, Florida rushed for 326 yards — its highest total since gaining 336 against Tennessee on Sept. 15.
Jeff Driskel broke Tim Tebow’s 
rushing record for a quarterback with 177 yards. He added three touchdowns.
Healthier offensive linemen al-
lowed Muschamp to challenge the unit with a more physical offsea-son.
Florida has responded with its 
highest rushing total through six games since 2009.
Younger players, like Silberman 
and D.J. Humphries, are seeing more repetitions during the week. On Saturday, that work paid off.
“With the way our coaches run 
the practice, it isn’t all about the starters the whole time,” Silber -
man said. “Everybody is getting reps. Everybody is familiar of the offense at any time. It’s not just the starters like it was last year and a couple years ago. Everybody knows the offense. Everybody knows what to do.”
The offensive line allowed one 
sack. Florida averaged 9.3 yards per carry.
Excluding Driskel’s 37- and 70-
yard touchdown runs, the Gators still averaged 6.6 yards per rush-ing attempt.
Florida managed 4.3 yards 
per attempt against Vanderbilt in 2011.“The resiliency of the team from 
a mental standpoint is definitely a lot different from last year,” Robey said. “When it starts getting tight right there, last year we might’ve folded. This year is a whole lot dif-ferent.”
Florida adjusted to the game’s 
physicality. Running behind a makeshift front isn’t desirable, but the Gators improvised.
UF overcame a first-quarter def-
icit with the same kind of smash-mouth football that has carried them to six straight victories and a top-three national ranking.
“(From) the center to the left 
side was all new guys,” Muschamp said. “When you run for over 300 yards, you are doing something right. Very pleased with those guys stepping up and doing a nice job for us.”

about any game. But they could also win 
them all, and that’s not something many expected coming into the year.
The reason for hesitation is simple: 
Florida isn’t overwhelmingly dominant. The faults are obvious, and they show in the results. On average, last season’s top 10 teams defeated unranked opponents by 25.7 points per game. Through four of those games this season, Florida’s aver -
age margin of victory is 17 points.
This Gators team is by no means his-
torically dominant. But in the landscape of college football this season, it doesn’t matter.
Defending national champion Ala-
bama is the unanimous No. 1 in this year’s poll. But this Crimson Tide team is unquestionably worse than last year’s. Four players were selected in the first round, including Heisman finalist Trent Richardson and three players from one of the best defenses in NCAA history.
If that team was around this season, 
Florida wouldn’t be in the national cham-pionship discussion. Hell, I’d bet none of these teams would be. Sure, Florida is improved. But would this year’s Florida even be in the top 10 last year?
Wisconsin was No. 10 in last season’s 
final AP Poll. Quarterback Russell Wil-son is a starter in the NFL and Montee Ball scored 39 touchdowns. Nick Toon and Jared Abbrederis would both be the best wideout on Florida’s roster. The of-fensive line, headed by first-round pick Kevin Zeitler and second-round pick Pe-ter Konz, was as strong as any in the na-tion. The defense was top-15 nationally.
This Florida team would not be in the 
national championship discussion most other seasons. But guess what? It isn’t most other years. It’s 2012, and Florida has as good a shot as anybody to play for the national championship when Janu-ary rolls around.

take advantage of it.
That’s what the Gators did with 11:27 re-
maining in the second quarter. Driskel took 
the ball around the left side on a read-option, scoring untouched from 37 yards out as fresh-man wide receiver Latroy Pittman cleared the way with a block.
On Florida’s first drive of the second half, 
Driskel scored from 13 yards out on the same play, only this time to the right side.
After being named the starting quarterback 
following the season opener against Bowling Green, Driskel’s passer rating improved with each of the next two games. Against Tennessee on Sept. 15, he had his best game as a Gator, completing 14 of 20 passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns.
But his passer rating has dropped with 
each of the last three games. He threw for just 61 yards against LSU on Oct. 6 and 77 against Vanderbilt. His 177 rushing yards on Satur -
day were 28 more than he had in the first five games combined.Driskel said he is content with continuing 
to win games on the ground.
“It doesn’t matter to me,” Driskel said of 
not throwing much. “We’re 6-0 right now and getting great wins on the road, and it doesn’t matter at all.”
The win raises the stakes 
for Florida’s showdown 
with South Carolina, which fell 23-21 to LSU on Sat-urday. The Gators have a chance to go up two games on their SEC East rival.
“It’s going to be a huge 
game,” Driskel said. “We’re going to be ready to go. It’s 
another big-time SEC East game, and we’re going to do what we can to win the game.”
South Carolina beat Florida the past two 
seasons, and the Gators are keeping that in mind.
“It’s personal,” cornerback Loucheiz Puri-
foy said. ”They took one last year in South Car -
olina, (and we’re) trying to get them back.”

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Florida 
blocked a field goal, picked up 
54 yards on a fake punt and got a 60-yard kick return out of a previously slumping Andre De-bose during Saturday’s 31-17 win against Vanderbilt. The Gators special teams have come a long way in 2012.
Following Florida’s 27-14 win 
against Bowling Green on Sept. 1, coach Will Muschamp called his team’s effort on special teams “sloppy.”
Said Muschamp on Sept. 3: 
“(I’m) very disappointed, (with) as much time as we spend on spe-cial teams around here.”
Five games later, his tone has 
changed. Key special teams plays proved crucial to the Gators’ two-touchdown victory against the Commodores.
With Vanderbilt threatening to 
pull within one point of the lead during the fourth quarter, red-shirt senior Earl Okine blocked a 44-yard field goal attempt.
“I jumped pretty high,” Okine 
said. “As soon as he snapped the ball, I got off the ball, pushed him back and jumped.”
Four plays later, Solomon Pat-
ton took a jet sweep on a fake punt 54 yards up the left sideline be-fore he was pushed out of bounds on Vanderbilt’s 3-yard line.
On Sept. 15, UF attempted 
a fake punt in its own territory during a 37-20 win against Ten-nessee. The Gators came up short and had to rely on a key defen-sive stop.
Following Patton’s run, a hold-ing call against Frankie Ham-mond Jr. pushed Florida back to Vanderbilt’s 13-yard line. On the next play, Jeff Driskel ran into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.
“It just changed the whole 
game. It can definitely bring down an opponent,” Patton said of his run. “When I got it and I looked up field, I saw so much grass I just got real excited, and I just took off.”
Said Muschamp: “I got tired 
of practicing it and just wanted to run it. We got the edge there. Jon Bostic made a fantastic block. Frankie Hammond made a fan-tastic block. And Solomon Pat-ton does that speed sweep very well.”
The Gators’ special teams 
came up big after a Commodores touchdown cut UF’s lead to 21-14. 
On the ensuing kickoff, De-
bose caught the ball at the 3-yard line and returned it 60 yards to Vanderbilt’s 37-yard line.
Florida turned the favorable 
field position into a 26-yard field goal by Caleb Sturgis. 
The kick gave the Gators a 
two-score lead.
“(It was) huge — flipped the 
field,” Muschamp said of De-bose’s return. “They had the mo-mentum at home, all of that good stuff. We blocked it extremely well.”Following Florida’s first 
touchdown, the Gators lined up in a swinging gate formation. Trey Burton took the snap and ran into the end zone, putting UF ahead 8-7.
“It was something we’ve been 
working on for a while, had it early in the year and really the numbers never presented them-selves,” Muschamp said. “We felt good about it, and Trey executed it very well.”
Sturgis was 3 of 3 on field goal 
attempts. Sturgis and LSU kicker Drew Alleman are tied for the Southeastern Conference lead with 11 made field goals each.
Against Vanderbilt, Kyle 
Christy averaged 46.2 yards per kick on five punts. He pinned the Commodores inside their own 20 three times. 
Christy currently ranks sixth 
nationally with 46.4 yards per punt. 
He has stuck the opposition 
inside its own 20-yard line on 41.4 percent of his 29 punts this season.
Leading up to Saturday’s 
game, Vanderbilt coach James Franklin addressed Florida’s suc-cess on special teams this season. 
Franklin praised the Gators’ 
unit, but said there was no secret to their success.
“I don’t think it’s anything 
unique to them,” Franklin said on Oct. 10. 
“It’s not like they’re running 
a scheme that nobody else is do-ing.”
Florida’s methods may not be 
unique, but so far in 2012, its re-sults are.
