Today, residents will cast their 
votes to choose between the two 
top-rated candidates for a City Com-mission seat. 
Helen K. Warren and Annie Or-
lando are the only choices on the ballot for at-large seat 2.
Mayor Ed Braddy said it’s no 
surprise the race went into a runoff.For a winner to be declared, a 
candidate must receive more than 
50 percent of the vote. The race had a ﬁ  eld of ﬁ  ve candidates in the general election March 11.
Warren and Orlando emerged 
as clear favorites in the race when they both received vote percentages in the mid-40s. Since they were the top two contenders, they will face each other in the 
runoff.
“Whenev-
er you have a crowded ﬁ  eld like they did in the at-large (race), there is a good chance that no one would 
quite get the 50 percent,” he said.As far as the impact of the run-
off election results, Braddy said “it’s hard to say.”
One new candidate won’t totally 
change the commission, he said, but it could signal direction for the com-mission.

After three decades of pub crawl-
ing, Gator Stompin’ organizers are 
mixing it up by hosting an EDM-type concert in the Bo Diddley Community Plaza with headliners Waka Flocka and Wolfgang Gartner.
Heather Lilholt, director of com-
munity events for Pledge 5 — the or-ganization planning the event — said Gator Stompin’ hopes to attract 10,000 people this year, but she said she real-izes the plaza can only accommodate so many.

Since its October inception, Swamp Re-
cords has hosted a showcase, launched a blog 
and co-sponsored an event at Gainesville Fashion Week. Now, it’s partnering with artists.
The student-run record label announced 
partnerships with Gainesville bands Bells and Robes and The Savants of Soul on March 31. These partnerships mean Swamp Records will provide promotional support to the bands, both of which include mem-bers with ties to UF. 
“Nothing is ofﬁ  cial yet,” Swamp Records 
head director Rachel Ring said. “What we can’t give them is money and a record deal like a major label, but we can help the bands get attention.”
The label collaborates with UF’s Audio 
Engineering Society, so it has the capabil-ity to produce and edit audio for the bands it works with. However, both bands were nearing the end of the recording process when they were approached by Swamp Re-cords.
Ring said she doesn’t think the univer-
sity is prepared to sign artists yet due to le-gal considerations and lack of precedent for this type of agreement, but the possibility is

This year, organizers got 
permission to close the street 
near the Hampton Inn and the area around the tax office and the Department of Motor Vehicles to accommodate the expected turnout, she said. 
Lilholt said she plans to 
have police officers, bounc-ers, emergency exits and the fire marshal to make sure the crowd is controlled. 
Because drugs can be 
common in the EDM envi-ronment, Lilholt said a plan is underway for combatting drug use. She wouldn’t elab-orate further.
Krystal Martin, Gainesville 
Police special events coordi-nator, said Pledge 5 has two permits in the works for the event — one for the use of the plaza and one for alcohol.
Both permits are still 
awaiting approval.
Martin said because the 
plaza is open, there really is no limit on the number of people who can attend, but if the alcohol permit is ap-proved, officers will make an assessment on the limit.
“One of the requirements 
for permit approval is having a certain number of crowd-control management,” Mar-tin said. “It’s their responsi-bility to cut off the number, and if they fail to do that, there will be officers in there that will remove them or shut down the event.”
Lilholt said she plans to 
hire bouncers to cover the crowd-control aspect because she expects a large turnout.“This is the first time we 
have actually paid for an art-ist that is bigger than what we normally have — we al-ways put local there,” she said. “We work with a lot of different clubs, so we’ll probably pull from the staff they’re not using.” 
Lilholt said people who 
purchase VIP tickets for the concert are guaranteed spots on the plaza, but general ad-mission is going to be first come, first served.
Russell Etling, the cultur-
al affairs coordinator for the city’s Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Department, has hosted many events on the plaza. He said he is un-sure whether the number of people Pledge 5 wants to fit on the plaza would work.
“I don’t think you could 
fit 10,000 in there,” he said. “I know the max would be about 2,000, though we’ve probably gotten close to 3,000 a couple of times.”there for future years if UF decides 
to take on that initiative.
“They’ve never dealt with any-
thing like this before,” she said.
Because the Swamp Records 
partnerships rely on unofficial verbal agreements instead of con-tracts, there is the possibility of accountability issues in the future. But Ring said she doesn’t foresee any issues with bands going back on their word or abusing the rela-tionship.
“If they don’t treat us well, we 
don’t have to work with them,” she said. “If it’s not mutually ben-eficial, then we can end the part-nership.”
The label could keep growing to 
a point where it could take on paid clients. But Ring said she doesn’t think money will ever be involved because the students “are not going to be professionals at any point.”
“Right now the purpose of 
Swamp Records is to help local musicians,” she said. 
The Savants of Soul bassist John 
Gray Shermyen said the “very al-truistic relationship” grants the band more freedom than a tradi-tional record deal.The lack of contractual obliga-
tion leaves the opportunity open for the bands to sign to a larger la-bel in the future — a decision that Swamp Records would support and even encourage, Ring said.
“We’re still holding onto cre-
ative control and keeping all of our opportunities open,” said Shermy-en, a 24-year-old UF alumnus.
Justin McKenzie, also a 24-year-
old UF alumnus, said the partner-ship with Swamp Records was a dream realized.
“I’ve been trying to get signed 
since I was 13 years old,” said the vocalist for the 11-piece soul act.

A local organization is working to put 
identification microchips in cats and dogs 
for free by hosting clinics around Alachua County at existing facilities.  
Helping Hands Pet Rescue decided to 
host the clinics after it was awarded a $10,000 grant for the chips from the Wagmore Foun-dation, a local organization devoted to re-ducing stray animal populations in Alachua County.
The grant allowed Helping Hands to pur-
chase 1,000 pet microchips, said Andrea Red-dick, executive director of Helping Hands.
The first clinic was held Saturday at West 
End Animal Hospital in Newberry, where organizers added microchips to 114 cats and dogs. Any Alachua County cat or dog owner is eligible for a free microchip, Reddick said.
The microchips are about the size of a 
grain of rice and are injected into the pet like a shot. If a pet is lost and turned into a shel-ter or veterinary office, the chip is scanned and the owner is contacted, Reddick said. 
Some animals are found with collars and 
leashes but no identification tags, she said. Currently, shelters are only required to keep animals for three days before they’re eutha-nized or transferred to a different location. If more animals in the community have micro-chips, shelters can connect more animals to their owners, Reddick said.
“We’re looking to increase the return-to-
owner rate at Alachua County Animal Ser-vices,” she said. “With the microchips, that percentage goes way up.”
The next free clinic will be held from 2 
to 5 p.m. on April 26 at the Micanopy Ani-mal Hospital. Reddick said the group will continue to do clinics until they run out of chips.
Dominique Levert, a 20-year-old UF psy-
chology junior, said she’d consider getting her black lab named Lily, who occasionally slips out of the house and runs around the neighborhood, a microchip.
“In case something ever happens,” Levert 
said, “I will be able to rely on that system to identify my dog.”

independent in terms of the issues and how they vote.”
Warren said the weeks between the 
original election and runoff have gone by quickly.
“But I’m too busy working and making 
phone calls to be nervous,” she said.Her campaign is working to ensure the 
voters who came out for the March elec-tion will hit the polls again and that those who didn’t vote previously will cast a bal-lot this time.
“We’re letting them know that this is a 
crucial vote,” she said.
Warren said if today’s election goes her 
way, she plans to learn everything she can about City Commission — starting with the budget.
But if it doesn’t, Warren said she’ll con-
tinue working as a real estate agent until she has the opportunity to run again.
The Alligator couldn’t reach Orlando 
for comment. But Braddy said he’s sup-porting her because of her “business-minded focus.” 
According to a Supervisor of Elections 
news release, registered voters who live within city limits can vote in their precinct between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. today.

BRADLEY NORMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Cyclists can now pump it up in 
downtown Gainesville.
The Alachua County Emerging 
Leaders unveiled one of two per-
manent bicycle pumps during a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday between the Hippodrome State Theatre and Boca Fiesta. The other pump is located on the corner of First Avenue and Main Street.
Andrew Romero, the organiza-
tion’s president, said the pumps would improve the quality of life for an increasing number of  Gainesville cyclists.
“One of the things that we’ve 
discovered is that young profes-sionals are driving their cars less and less every day,” he said.
Depending on the success of the pumps, the organization will consider adding more.
“I think these are one of the 
first of its kind here in the area,” Romero said, “so this will be an experiment, probably for the city and the community.”
Susan Bottcher, the outgoing 
District 3 city commissioner, said although the commission wasn’t officially involved, it offered guid-ance along the way.
“This melts in perfectly with 
our goals to try to improve the walkability and bike-ability in the urban core,” she said.
Michelle Ibarra, a 19-year-old 
UF art history freshman, said the organization should consider in-stalling pumps on campus.
“I’ve seen tons of students rid-
ing bikes,” she said, “so I think in-stalling them on campus would be really useful and convenient, and they’d get used more.”Bikers, get pumped: Air

UF is asking students to leave bad habits behind in 
honor of Earth Day.
The Office of Sustainability is celebrating Campus 
Earth Day on Friday with its Turn Over a New Leaf cam-
paign. 
The campaign involves students pledging to take part 
in one new sustainable activity in any of the areas of waste, transportation, food and energy, said Laurel Nes-bit, an Office of Sustainability program assistant.“I recently just got a new bike, so I would pledge to bike 
more and drive less,” said Danielle Overton, a 19-year-old UF animal sciences freshman.
UF’s Office of Sustainability celebrates Earth Day, 
which normally and nationally lands on April 22, early to avoid conflicts with Spring finals.“We move Earth Day on campus to earlier in the month 
so that more people can be involved,” Nesbit said. 
The event starts at 10 a.m. on the Plaza of Americas 
and will feature UF President Bernie Machen’s annual state of sustainability address. 
Jessica Yomano, an 18-year-old UF nutrition freshman, 
said it’s a smart idea to change the date of the observance of the holiday on campus. 
“I think it’s great that UF is doing as much as it can to 
be a sustainable university,” she said. 
The Office of Sustainability also partners with Healthy 
Gators to hold the Champions for Change award cer-emony, which recognizes individuals in the UF commu-nity who have contributed meaningfully to sustainability, health or both, Nesbit said.Earth Day encourages students to adopt one sustainable habit

Scott relies on 
half truths in      
gubernatorial race
As the November gubernatorial election looms on Flor-
ida’s horizon, the Rick Scott and Charlie Crist camps are neck and neck in the polls. However, a Voter Sur-
vey Service poll commissioned by the Sunshine State News released Monday revealed Scott has pulled slightly ahead of Crist. As it stands, Scott leads with a 45-percent poll ranking, and Crist is lagging at 44 percent. 
News outlets blame Crist’s public support of Affordable 
Care Act. The Sunshine State News reported “the weight of Crist’s support for President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law continues to drag him down,” citing James Lee, the president of Voter Survey Service.
This season’s close race is like stepping into a time machine. 
The Sunshine State News also reported Lee said, “‘This race, in my opinion, looks very locked in. In other words, it almost looks like a repeat of what we had in the summer of 2010.’” 
Lee “described the Scott versus Alex Sink race as a back and 
forth ping-pong match in polling,” according to the article.
The sudden uptick in Scott approval is surprising consid-
ering all his shady behavior that’s recently come to light. The Tampa Bay Times released a report Saturday that detailed his stealthy way of evading public records: In 2010, Scott pro-claimed Florida’s ownership of two planes for ofﬁ  cial travel wasteful and replaced them with a private jet he purchased “at his expense.”
But no public plane, Times writer Steve Bousquet said, 
means no public records. 
“Scott’s air travel reﬂ  ects not only his wealth, but his pref-
erence for stealth,” Bousquet wrote. “Despite his oft-stated support for transparency, Scott keeps his ﬂ  ight itineraries off tracking websites and even blacks out arrival and departure details on ofﬁ  cial schedules after the fact, citing the need for security.”
As governor, Scott doesn’t have to disclose details about 
travel plans and expenses like other candidates, and he’s using 
it to his campaign’s advantage. 
Bousquet wrote that Scott is busy using half-truths to smear 
Crist. Last month, a PolitiFact Florida ruling found that a claim 
made by the Scott camp in an email to the media wasn’t fully accurate. An email to reporters said Crist signed “an automatic 15 percent annual tuition raise” for public universities. While Crist did pass a law allowing tuition increases, the increases weren’t automatic, and they weren’t always 15 percent. Poli-tiFact Florida said Scott’s statement is “partially accurate, but leaves out many important details.”
This evasion of campaign regulations and ﬂ  at-out lying 
highlights Scott’s disconnect with Florida’s general popula-tion. But his lead in the poll begs the question: Will Scott’s old antics — protecting big-business interests and not reporting all the facts — land him a second term? Who knows? 
For Florida, the possibility of another four years with no-
body’s favorite Lord Voldemort look-alike isn’t far off.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgMonday’s question: Have you been 
skydiving? Today’s question: Do you know who Bo Diddley is?Accent should invite more alleged criminals
Accent Speakers Bureau announced its sponsoring 
of Ehud Olmert, the former Israeli prime minister, before he abruptly canceled the visit on April 1. I 
ﬁ  nd myself defending Accent’s decision to bring the ex-Israeli prime minister. This might strike you as odd, con-sidering Olmert’s dark side, but let me explain. 
As an 8-year-old, I used to ﬂ  ip through this one over-
sized history picture book. One day, I came upon the fa-mous line attributed to Voltaire: “I do not agree with what you have to say, but I’ll defend to the death your right to say it.” 
Living up to that credo hasn’t been easy. As a Muslim, 
I remember ﬁ  nding it hard initially to defend Terry Jones’ right to offend my faith. But, then you realize, what’s the point of freedom of speech if it means we only uphold it when the speech or the speaker is morally acceptable?   
It is in this spirit that I defend the right of Accent to 
bring Olmert, an alleged war criminal. 
I am aware many students are deeply disturbed by the 
idea of someone like Olmert stepping foot onto our cam-pus. It doesn’t help that our student tuition funds would go in his pockets, but that type of idiocy is expected when you’re represented by Accent, a festering pool of nepotism as revealed by local newspaper stories. 
My defense of Accent’s decision to bring Olmert comes 
with great unease. The man has a sickening and ugly past, and that’s no reference to the bribery charges he was con-victed of last month. 
As prime minister, Olmert maintained Israeli control 
over the Gaza Strip, a tiny stretch of land inhabited by about 1.8 million people. Gaza has been enduring mili-tary occupation since 1967. But just in case the vanquished families — starving, as they were since Israel began pre-venting adequate food, water, electricity supplies and medication entering into Gaza in 2007 — were getting ad-justed to the pain and misery, Olmert’s cabinet decided it was time to have some fun. 
On Dec. 27, 2008, Olmert launched “Operation Cast 
Lead” against the population of Gaza, and a full-scale in-vasion ensued shortly after. Although the public reason from Olmert’s side was to stop Palestinian rocket barrages, few outside analysts bought the argu-ment as Israel targeted schools, mosques, hospitals, ambulances and UN buildings. 
By the end of the three-week 
bloodbath, nearly 1,000 Palestin-ian civilians had been slaugh-tered — about one third of them 
children. The Israeli side received three civilian casualties. A defenseless Palestinian civilian population had seen the wrath of Olmert and his cohorts. 
In case the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty Inter-
national condemnations against Israeli brutality weren’t clear enough, an independent UN investigative team found evidence of the Israeli ofﬁ  cials having committed war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. 
Currently, even the Israeli Supreme Court is consider-
ing charges against Olmert for his involvement in killings, collective punishment and attacks on Palestinian civilian infrastructure. Olmert’s involvement in the massacre is undeniable — only a rabid backer of Israel could say oth-erwise. 
Accent played off Olmert’s past by saying he’s just 
another “controversial” speaker. Well, Olmert is “contro-versial” if you somehow consider Kim Jong-un or Osama bin Laden as controversial — to call a ruthless murderer or a terrorist “controversial” seems a bit of an understate-ment. 
Nevertheless, I defend Accent’s right to bring someone 
like Olmert. 
And if Accent is down to bring more alleged criminals 
to our campus in the future, there are some other murder-ers I’d love to hear from. 
Considering how high the bar has been set, I doubt 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would make the cut, but I’m sure Accent could ﬁ  nd someone else.

Here’s a number that’s scary for Republicans: 18 per-
centage points. 
Since 2006, that’s been the Democrats’ aver-
age lead among young voters nationwide, according to Gallup. It makes sense that the party that has stood in the way of marriage equality, immigration reform, raising the minimum wage, equal pay for equal work and increasing college aid for students would have a problem connecting with young Americans. And in election years, this gap mat-ters even more. For example, President Obama’s 67-percent share of young voters in 2012 was widely cited as one of the major contributors to his victory.
Well, it’s another election year, and despite a self-com-
missioned “Autopsy Report” calling on Republicans to shift gears with young people, the GOP hasn’t changed. Repub-licans shut down the government in an attempt to boot ap-proximately 3 million young Americans off their families’ health insurance plans. They pushed for discriminatory anti-LGBTQ legislation in states across the country and continue to block immigration reform, which would help young im-migrants gain access to higher education and a path to U.S. citizenship. House Republicans even voted for a bill that could dismantle the Obama administration’s action to pro-vide relief from deportation for undocumented youth.
In short, the GOP is still pushing the same old agenda 
that has alienated young voters for years. And rather than taking concrete steps to appeal to young Americans, its 2014 strategy is becoming clearer: Since it can’t win with its ideas, it has decided to rig the system.
In North Carolina, a restrictive GOP voter law prevents 
college students from using their school IDs as voter iden-tiﬁ  cation. In Florida, Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s admin-istration blocked the use of the Reitz Union as an early vot-ing site. In Pennsylvania, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett is ﬁ  ghting a court decision invalidating the state’s restrictive voter ID law, which limited the types of student IDs that could be used to vote. After pushing a 2011 bill that would prevent many students from voting in their college towns, the Republican Speaker of the New Hampshire House ra-tionalized his support by saying young voters are “foolish,” “liberal” and “just vote with their feelings.” And those are just four examples. 
For those of us in school or just out of it, crucial tools that 
allow young voters and all Americans to more easily par-ticipate in the electoral process are under attack by Republi-cans, from early voting hours and absentee voting to voting where you go to school. By ending or limiting these, Repub-licans aren’t targeting just anybody: They’re targeting us.
Unlike Republicans, who have doubled down on a cyni-
cal scheme to stymie voter turnout, Democrats’ key values — like inclusion and empowerment — continue to deﬁ  ne everything we do. We believe that more voices mean more prosperity and that there is no issue in this country that’s ever been solved with less democracy. That’s why we’re tak-ing action to stop the GOP’s efforts to make it more difﬁ  cult to vote and to promote our own efforts to expand the fran-chise to more Americans.
The Democratic Party’s push to expand the vote focuses 
on ensuring that every eligible citizen can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted. We’re doing this not only by challenging legisla-tive obstacles to voting but also by proactively working to register more voters and strengthen the democratic process nationwide.
On this issue, like many others, Democrats are standing 
with young Americans while Republicans are shutting them out. Our voices won’t be silenced. 
Instead, young people across the country are ready to 
ﬁ  ght these cynical political tactics and support Democratic efforts to expand the vote.

Why are Republicans pushing to

The Internet has given us so many beautiful and 
fantastic things. We can communicate with oth-ers in far-off lands, we can research almost any-
thing within the span of a minute, and we can create and share information instantly. But it’s also bred a new class of web users that almost everyone with an Internet connection has experienced: the troll.
Yes, they exist outside of 
“The Lord of the Rings” and “Harry Potter” universes. Trolls are the people who have something to say about everything they’ve ever read or seen on the Internet. They can be racist, sexist, vulgar or a combination of all three. The troll is unofﬁ  cially de-ﬁ  ned as “an abusive or ob-noxious user who uses shock value to promote argu-ments and disharmony in online communities.”
Nothing is ever good enough or correct enough to 
these members of the cyber society. To them, there is always a ﬂ  aw in what is published. Since the birth of forums or comment sections, trolls have crawled out of their caves and discovered the ﬁ  ne art of annoying literally everyone.
Remember when your mother told you, “If you 
don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it at all?” This was never told to the trolls. Their creed is, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, say it over and over again.” I may joke around, but in all actuality, this high level of maliciousness has caught the attention of psycholo-gists.
These psychologists have seen the aggressive and 
blind hate ﬁ  rsthand because they, shockingly, also have access to the Internet. The scientists believe trolls have become a class of online sadists. They thrive off of putting other people down.
Rather than offering constructive criticism, they im-
mediately shut down any amount of positivity. Not only is this form of cyber-bullying sadistic, but it’s also narcissistic. They get pure pleasure out of criticizing others and feeling like they know the truth about ev-ery topic under the sun. If they believe they are right and have the right to say such, that means they believe their viewpoints and opinions are more valid than any-one else’s — classic narcissism. Studies have also been conducted where these people are said to be “insatiably nasty.”
They are fueled by the arguments and sadness they 
incite in others. The overall crux of the study shows psychopathic characteristics in the trolls based on the negative qualities they possess.
You most likely would not be able to spot the aver-
age troll in real life. These people wait until they are behind the screen of a computer before they feel safe in putting others down. Having the security blanket of online anonymity has allowed trolls to talk a big game yet cower behind the screen.
So you may be asking yourself, “Rachel, what should 
I do to avoid Internet trolls?” The sad truth is that there is nothing you can really do. Odds are the person who has the tenacity to nitpick a random detail is not going to be the same person who concedes during an argu-ment. The more one argues with them, the happier and more satisﬁ  ed they become. Your best bet is to ignore them, roll your eyes and move on with life. If an argu-ment ensues, you will only become more frustrated as the troll becomes more excitable.  
Long story short: There will always be people in 
your life whom you don’t agree with or simply cannot tolerate but have to interact with. Trolls are not these people. They are not worth your time and not worth your energy. The less attention they get, the hungrier they will be for conﬂ  ict. 
So, don’t feed the trolls. Rachel Kalisher is a UF anthropology and classics 
junior. Her columns appear on Tuesdays.Don’t feed the 
trolls: a new class of cyber bulliesGuest column

opinions@alligator.org
In a recent installment of “Black 
Girl Dangerous,” a popular blog of the post-New Left, Mia McKenzie 
questions the willingness of people of color to defend “The Colbert Report” against Suey Park’s #CancelColbert Twitter campaign. “What is white ra-cial satire doing for us that is so im-portant?” McKenzie asks, wondering why people of color would put them-selves on the line in defense of a white comedian.
The wording of the question is part 
of a trend in post-New Left circles that devalues the nuances of individual experience in favor of identity-based narratives. A person of color defend-ing Stephen Colbert is suspect because his or her primary motive should be racial self-interest.
The details of the event itself are 
less important than their potential as jumping-off points for discussions of race, gender and sexuality. In the process, individual experiences are ﬂ  attened and personal agency is di-minished.
Park’s very campaign is emblem-
atic of this approach. Despite the cam-paign’s name, Park is not particularly concerned with any single joke or even Colbert himself. In an interview with Salon, she describes the hashtag as a “tool” to describe the evil of “white-ness at large.” According to Park, no individual white person is welcome in her revolution against the racist hege-mony because “whiteness will always be the enemy.” Park expresses impa-tience with “understanding context,” instead highlighting the overwhelm-ing importance of race in determining her understanding of events.
“Black Girl Dangerous” takes a sim-
ilarly deterministic approach to iden-tity and interpersonal relations. White supremacy, patriarchy, homophobia and cissexism are treated not as overall trends but as literal realities that cre-ate near-impossible divides between identity groups. According to the blog’s ideology, empathy across lines of gender, race or sexuality is virtually impossible. In fact, a large proportion of the blog’s posts are dedicated to casting suspicion on the very idea of an “ally.” Aside from a page that en-courages readers to become “allies of the blog” for $20 a month, the term is treated with a mix of skepticism and disdain.
Emphasizing boundaries and divi-
sions is one of the blog’s primary mo-tives. 
While McKenzie and other con-
tributors might make passing mention of self-avowed enemies of the move-ment, their true vitriol is reserved for those who attempt to transgress so-cial boundaries. Thus, activists are far more likely to criticize Macklemore’s pro-gay anthem “Same Love” than Eminem’s blatantly homophobic “Rap God.” People who attempt to serve as allies to a movement outside their identities are far more suspect than those that act in self-interest.
Tightening boundaries makes 
good sense as a business strategy for rising stars of the post-New Left. By emphasizing the importance of race in shaping interests, identity bloggers can essentially corner the market. In this light, Park’s interview style has as much to do with self-promotion as it does with social change. Park devotes as much space to referencing her own work as a creative writer and come-dian as she does to critiquing the pow-ers that be. Park’s message to potential audiences and employers is clear. Her identity as a person of color allows her comedy to succeed where the work of white satirists inevitably fails.
Yet while the post-New Left’s 
boundaries keep the privileged out and beneﬁ  t activists colonizing new mar-kets, they also police the behavior of the disadvantaged identities it claims to speak for. When people of color, gays and women transgress identity-based barriers, they are accused of internalized racism, homophobia and sexism. 
Colbert is by all means an imperfect 
ally. Sometimes his jokes go too far, and sometimes they unintentionally detract from his broader purpose. Yet at its best, his work calls into question and exposes the unsound foundations of our nation’s racist, homophobic, transphobic and sexist assumptions. Activists like Park and McKenzie have made a name for themselves by high-lighting and reinforcing the boundar-ies that divide us. Colbert and, yes, white racial satire, show us how ab-surd those boundaries are to begin with.

ARLINGTON, Texas — After Ken-
tucky’s Andrew Harrison’s desperation 
three-point attempt clanked off the rim, Connecticut guard Ryan Boatright grabbed the defensive board, dribbled down the court and spiked the ball in celebration as the buzzer sounded.
After not surrendering a lead for the en-
tire game, UConn had ﬁ  nally achieved its moment of glory.With a 60-54 victory 
against the No. 8 seed Wildcats (29-11) on Mon-
day night in a front of a championship game-record 79,238 fans in AT&T Stadium, the No. 7 seed Huskies (32-8) — who beat Florida 63-53 on Saturday en route to 
the title game — are now national cham-pions for the second time in four seasons. Second-year coach Kevin Ollie’s group re-sponded to each run Kentucky threw its way it with poise.
“Somebody told me we were Cinder-
ellas. No, we’re UConn,” Ollie said. “This is what we do. We’re born for this. We’re bred to cut down the nets.”

   The Gators are gearing up for the meet 
they’ve been waiting for all season: the 
2014 NCAA Championship. With less than two weeks until Florida has to defend the title it claimed for the ﬁ  rst time in 2013, coach Rhonda Faehn is looking for some key improvements.
  “We had a 
solid competi-tion, deﬁ  nitely not our best, 
and our athletes know that,” Faehn said of Florida’s performance at the 2014 Univer-sity Park Regionals. 
  “We had a great start and a great ﬁ  nish 
and we had some areas in between that we really are going to address this week and work on.” 
  During regionals on Saturday, Florida 
suffered a few uncharacteristic falls and posted its second-lowest total score of the season (197.05). Faehn said her gymnasts’ excitement for NCAA’s may have put them out of the right mindset for the chal-lenge they were facing.  
  “Maybe they were looking past, a little 
bit, the competition and not as 100 percent focused and dialed in on being there in that exact moment,” Faehn said. “That’s some-thing we’re going to keep working on this week and putting them in pressure situa-Weekend

ZOOP’S SCOOP
ARLINGTON, Texas — 
Trust me Gators fans, I know this sucks.
Florida only lost three times this 
season — twice to national cham-pion UConn. If it weren’t for the Huskies, Billy Donovan and com-pany would have had a good shot at taking down rival Kentucky for an amazing fourth time in the title game Monday night.
Instead, the Gators are left 
sulking their Final Four defeat in Gainesville while Kevin Ollie and the rest of his UConn squad celebrate all the way back to Storrs, Conn. But Donovan and his four seniors had to endure three straight Elite Eight busts to get to where they got Saturday. The Huskies weren’t even in the tournament last year.
So how is it fair that Florida will 
have to wait until next year to try and bring home a third national title? 
As a Chicago Cubs 
fan, I’ve been telling myself “There’s al-ways next year” for as long as I can remem-ber. So yeah, I feel your pain.
In a shocking twist 
of events, my Cubbies 
actually managed to capture the National League Central Division in 2007 and 2008 — even claiming the league’s best record in the lat-ter year.
Despite having a roster ﬁ  lled 
with All-Stars and a future Hall of Fame manager in Lou Piniella, Chicago was swept in the Division Series both seasons. I didn’t know how to react.
Should I be happy my team 
had enormous success in the regu-lar season? Or should I be disap-pointed we didn’t end the year like I wanted?
Well, I know how you Gators 
fans should remember this season.Remember this year as one of 
the greatest in Florida history. Remember this year as one that started in shambles and ended in unity. 
Remember this year for what it 
was: amazing.
When Billy Donovan took the 
podium on October 9 during Flor-ida’s media day, even he didn’t know how special his squad would be down the road.

JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
After dropping four straight 
contests, Florida was looking for a 
spark heading into its three-game series against Auburn.
Behind solid pitching and key 
hits late in the game, the No. 6 
Gators found their spark with a  sweep over the No. 19 Tigers this past weekend at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.
“We felt like this weekend 
could be a really big turning point for us,” sophomore Aubree Mu-nro said after Florida’s 4-2 win to open the series on Friday. “No one feels good losing four in a row.”
Added coach Tim Walton: “One thing we have to be able to look at is the fact that we still have a young team. With a young team comes confidence, and W’s always help teams regain confidence if they lost it, gain confidence if they don’t have it. … We really kept a consistent work ethic. I don’t re-ally think we’ve changed a whole lot other than maybe a couple per-sonnel pieces along the way.”
Munro started the series on a 
high note, notching two doubles in Game 1 to bring her total to nine on the season. Since Florida’s series against Tennessee, Munro has tallied four doubles, matching her total from her freshman year.
“It feels really good,” the Brea, 
Calif., native said. “I’ve been kind of messing with my swing a little bit, just making sure I get back to being simple because that’s what works for me. I’m not a huge home run hitter. I think just doing my job and keeping it simple and getting to the ball has been really good for me.”
Merritt finding success at the 
plate: During Florida’s series-
opening win against Auburn on Friday, Kirsti Merritt was a non-factor at the plate.
After batting .444 in three 
games against Tennessee, the sophomore center fielder went 0 for 2 with a strikeout in the first game against the Tigers.
But Merritt rebounded to close 
out the series. 
In Florida’s 7-6 win on Sat-
urday, Merritt hit leadoff home runs in the third and fifth innings — both of which put the Gators in the lead.
“I don’t think there’s any pres-
sure on this team,” Merritt said. “When I come up to bat, I feel like they’re behind me no matter what, and if I’m going to hit a home run, I’m going to hit a home run. If I strike out, they’re going to be like ‘It’s no big deal.’”
On the season, the Lake Pana-
soffkee native boasts a .304 bat-ting average and a .580 slugging clip — the second-highest mark on the team. 
Merritt’s eight home runs are 
second on the team only to junior Lauren Haeger, and she is one of two Florida batters to have at least 30 hits, 30 RBIs and 10 stolen bases this season.
“She plays 
hard,” Walton said. “It’s really hard to fault her … because you know she’s go-ing to give it her all.”
Notes: Kelsey 
Stewart saw her on base streak of 41 games end on Sunday, when she went 0 for 4 at the plate. Stew-art’s streak broke UF’s record of 37 set by Michelle Moultrie in 2011. … Taylor Schwarz drew a walk for the sixth straight contest on Sunday. After being walked only 15 times through Florida’s first 36 games, the sophomore first baseman has drawn nine walks since March 30. … Florida’s 1-0 win against Auburn on Sun-day was its 11th shutout victory of the season and its first against a ranked opponent. … With the win on Sunday, senior Hannah Rogers has now pitched 34 career shutouts, four shy of tying with Stephanie Brombacher for the sec-ond most in UF history.

on the here and now and not getting ahead of ourselves.”
The Gators still managed 
wins in all events and ended the meet with a first-place finish. 
Because Florida finished in 
the top two at regionals, the team, along with Penn State, automatically advanced to the 12-team championship field. 
“We’re thrilled to be able 
to be going to the national championship,” Faehn said. 
“It’s a huge honor every 
single year to know that ev-erything you worked for all season long it’s this close now.”
With a weekend off be-
fore the Gators travel to the NCAA Championship on April 16, Faehn said she’s planning a potential mock in-tersquad competition for the weekend. 
“We want to be able to 
keep them in the competition mindset,” she said. 
Since the start of postsea-son on March 22, Florida has had two weeks off in between each meet — a much longer respite than the gymnasts get during regular-season norm of one competition a week. 
“It gives our athletes a 
little bit of time to recover,” Faehn said. 
“I think the turnaround 
wouldn’t be long enough if we were instantly head-ing into the competition this week. I think that would be just pushing it too much for the athletes…but at the same time we’re so ready and we just want it to be here.” 
As for in-practice specif-
ics, Faehn wants to see hard landings from her gymnasts — an expectation that was relaxed at the midpoint of the season in an effort to prevent in-practice injuries. 
“Some of the athletes get-
ting a little bit more of those hard landings because not there’s really no more time left to try and save them physically…” Faehn said. 
“Now’s the time really to 
make sure that they’re 100 percent ready for all those landings.”TUESDAY, APRIL 8, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Gators return several key players in ‘14-15
So no, the Gators didn’t take 
home the gold — or even the sil-
ver. But let’s be honest, if Donovan couldn’t even predict a Final Four appearance, could you?
I hate to compare the Cubs and 
the Gators (I don’t want to make it seem like Florida has been a loser for more than 100 years), but if I saw my Cubbies make it back to the National League pennant, I might die.
Since that hasn’t happened in 
more than a decade, and since it probably won’t happen for another decade, I will most likely be stuck saying “There’s always next year” for a while.But not you Gators fans. It hon-
estly could be next year.

be gone, you have Kasey Hill and Chris Walker most likely return-ing for their sophomore seasons, Dorian Finney-Smith and Michael Frazier coming back and another group of talented freshman joining Donovan’s stacked roster.
UConn deserved to take home 
the title this year. The Huskies de-feated the Gators — arguably the most well put together team in the tournament — twice during the season. They had to take down basketball giants like Villanova, Michigan State and Kentucky to bring home their fourth national title.
However, Ollie will have the 
challenge of replacing future NBA stars in Shabazz Napier and De-Andre Daniels while Donovan will still have key pieces to build upon for the future. Trust Donovan, he knows what he’s doing. 
If you’re too pessimistic or de-
pressed to believe me, just look at where the four seniors started and where they ended their collegiate careers.
And since he signed that exten-
sion, which runs until the 2018-2019 season, Donovan will most likely be back in the Final Four a few more times before he either calls it quits or heads to the NBA. 
So Florida fans, there’s always 
next year and the year after that and the year after that. 
If I can keep the faith for my 
atrocious Cubbies, you can stand strong with your Gators.

Villanova, 3-seed Iowa State, 4-seed Michigan State 
and No. 1 overall seed Florida to get to this point. 
Out of the gates, the Huskies were firing. Thanks 
to eight early points from Boatright and a hot start for Napier, the Huskies jumped out to a 30-15 lead at the 5:59 mark. 
But the Wildcats switched to a zone defense and 
soon clawed back into the game, closing the half on a 16-5 run fueled by three three-pointers — two coming from James Young.
Wildcats guard Aaron Harrison scored five 
quick points in the second half to cut UConn’s lead to 37-36, but the Huskies responded with an 11-3 run. UK threw its next punch with an 8-0 run — highlighted by a one-handed slam by Young over Connecticut’s Amida Brimah. 
The Huskies answered with threes from Napier 
and forward Niels Giffey. 
The Huskies began to pull away after DeAndre 
Daniels faked out two UK defenders and scored in the paint to give his team a 58-52 lead with 2:47 left. On the next possession, Julius Randle missed a jumper for the ‘Cats.
After wasting 31 seconds, Giffey missed a jump-
er. Luckily for the Huskies, Lasan Kromah was there for the offensive board with 1:54 left.The result? Thirty-two more seconds of wasted 
clock.
Young cut the Wildcats deficit to four points 
with a layup at the 1:08 mark, but the next posses-sion, Kromah drew a foul on Alex Poythress in the post. The 6-foot-6 Connecticut swingman took ad-vantage of the moment and sunk both of his free throws for the final points of the game.
On the final possession, the Harrison twins 
missed two attempts. As the Wildcats missed out on a shot at their second title in three years, the Hus-kies basked in joy. 
“Even in that loss, I can’t believe what these guys 
got done together,” Kentucky coach John Calipari said. 
“I needed to do a better job for these kids today, 
because they needed more help in this.”
After UConn missed the NCAA Tournament 
last season due to a postseason ban for several years of failing to meet the NCAA’s academic standards, Ollie had his group at the podium soaking in the confetti and “One Shining Moment.”
A team that had lost to Louisville by 33 points on 
March 8 had made a complete turnaround.
“You’re looking at the hungry Huskies,” Napier 
shouted in a postgame interview with CBS’s Jim Nantz. “This is what happens when you ban us. Last year, two years, we worked so hard for it.”UK kept game close to its finish

AGAINST JOHNS HOPKINS.

      In her third straight start, Mary-Sean Wil-
cox showed just how valuable she is in net.
While No. 4 Florida (13-2, 4-0 American La-
crosse Conference) won 10-9 at No. 13 Johns 
Hopkins (10-2, 1-2 ALC) on Saturday, it wasn’t the offense or the defense that shined for the Gators — it was the team’s sophomore goal-keeper.
In a game where every draw control, 
ground ball and offensive possession could swing momentum, the Gators found solace in Wilcox as she made save after save and ulti-mately kept them in the game.
Wilcox was Florida’s No. 2 goalkeeper for 
the first 12 games of the season, starting her first game of the season against Stetson on March 26. She worked mostly as a closer for redshirt senior goalkeeper Cara Canington, but coach Amanda O’Leary said the sopho-more has been battling it out with Canington for the starting position all season in practice.
Wilcox agreed with O’Leary and said prac-
tices are pivotal in deciding who will start, specifically for the goalkeepers. 
But Wilcox said having two exceptional 
keepers practice against each other every day for a starting position has helped them become better players.“[Canington is] a very experienced goalie,” 
Wilcox said. “I think we work well together, I think that even though it is a battle we do still help each other out in practice and games and stuff. So we’re very supportive, but were both very competitive at the same time.”
Wilcox played her best game of her career 
yet, tallying eight total saves in her second full game of the season. The Lutherville, Md., na-tive became the Gators’ biggest momentum builder in the start of the second half after the Blue Jays jumped out to a 4-2 lead.
With a close score at the end of the game, 
Wilcox made sure to hang on and prevent the Blue Jays from tying up the score with a quick save on a free-position shot.
The issue Wilcox now faces is making sure 
to repeat her performance when Florida faces Vanderbilt on Sunday — the team that broke Johns Hopkins’ 10 game win streak just a week before it faced Florida.
“Vanderbilt is a tremendous program as 
well,” O’Leary said. “They have done a really great job (this season). They have a tremen-dous coaching staff there. Their upperclass-man are very, very seasoned.”
The Commodores’ sophomore midfielder, 
Kelly Chandler, has had breakout perfor-mances in the last two weeks and will be one of Florida’s biggest targets in defending.  Against Hopkins, Chandler led the Commodores to a 12-11 win with four goals.
Florida only has two regular-season games 
left and both are ALC conference games. 
If Wilcox can continue to make big saves and make momentum-changing game plans, Florida could shut down Chandler’s scoring abilities and consequently, control the offen-sive pace for Sunday’s game.“We have our work cut out for us,” O’Leary 
said. “The big thing for this program is to get going faster. … We need to go out and set the pace of this game.”

A little bit of rain couldn’t stop 
Florida from getting off to a prom-
ising start in its final regular-season tournament.
The Gators are competing at the 
two-day Old Waverly Collegiate Championship in West Point, Miss. The 15-team field was scheduled to begin play at 8:30 a.m. Monday, but a flash flood from the night before caused a delay.
None of the 
teams made it through the scheduled two 
rounds of 18 holes each before the tournament 
was suspended due to darkness.Florida stands in a tie for third 
with Southeastern Conference foe Ole Miss, totaling a score of 289 (+1) through one round.
Cincinnati sits at the top of the 
field with a score of 284 (-4).
“We played reasonably well to-
day, nothing spectacular,” coach Buddy Alexander said in a release. “Our two juniors played solid all day, and everybody contributed a little bit beyond that.”
Eric Banks, one of the two ju-
niors, leads the Gators after shoot-ing 69 (-3) in the first round. He shot even par on 15 holes and made three birdies, leading to a tie for sec-ond place.
J.D. Tomlinson, Florida’s other 
junior, broke even on par with a 72, earning him a tie for 16th place. Tomlinson finished with two bo-geys and one double bogey while also recording four birdies.
Richard Donegan has continued 
his solid play from the Valspar In-vitational two weeks ago. Through the first round, he shot 73 (+1) with three birdies and is tied for 22nd place.
