Jamie Marks stood in front 
of her Rhetoric and Academic 
Research class Monday morn-ing as one of her students picked up a newspaper.
“What do you think about 
this guy?” the student asked, pointing to a front-page story.
A man died Sunday night, 
the article read. He fell from the stairs in the northwest corner of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
Who was he? Marks asked.The student said a name 
that made Marks shudder: Mi-chael R. Edmonds Jr.
“My legs went to jelly,” 
Marks said. “I started to shake. My gut soured.”
At about 12:30 p.m. Sunday, 
Edmonds sent Marks a text: “I need your help sometime soon.” The two met online a couple years ago and in person over beers at Hogan’s last year. The bond was instant — Ed-monds, the journalism major who could talk candidly about his life and struggles as hours drifted away , and Marks, the anthropology graduate student who loved listening and asking questions.
The two exchanged more 
texts Sunday. Marks was driv-ing back from Cedar Key , and she asked if they could meet for a long discussion later this week. She said she would call when she got home, probably around 4 p.m., she guessed.
The trip back to Gainesville 
took longer than Marks ex-pected, and she didn’t arrive until around 9 p.m. — about two hours after Edmonds died. She didn’t hear about it for 12 Help available for

At around noon Monday, about 200 stu-
dents circled the Computer Sciences and Engi-
neering building. With stretched-out arms and hands held tight, they shouted, “Save CISE.”
The protest attracted students and faculty 
from the computer and information science and engineering department (CISE) who are angry about the proposal College of Engineer-ing administrators have made to address a looming 5.86 percent budget cut — roughly $4 million.
“This is the end of CISE as we know it,” 
said Nuri Yeralan, computer and information science and engineering Ph.D. student and leader of the movement against the proposal.
The CISE department is one of 10 depart-
ments in the College of Engineering.
College of Engineering Dean Cammy Ab-
ernathy has said that across-the-board cuts would hurt some departments irreparably . Many faculty members feel the CISE depart-ment is being unfairly targeted.
The proposal, announced by Abernathy 
last week, calls for major changes in the CISE department, including the elimination of two faculty members, 10 staff positions and all teaching assistants and support staff. The plan also involves moving computer engineering programs over to the electrical and computer engineering department.
Meera Sitharam, an associate professor 
in the CISE department, said the proposed changes will impact the department’s re-search, hurting the careers of faculty members and causing many to leave.
With no teaching assistants and no support 
staff, she said, the teaching obligation for fac-ulty would be impossible to handle.

About 240 UF students won’t ﬁ  nd their bicycles today 
where they last left them, but it’s not because they were stolen. They were probably collected under the supervision of Univer-sity Police by the university’s Physical Plant Division.
The second abandoned bike pickup of the school year took place Monday. Police tagged bicycles that had rusted chains, ﬂ  at tires and missing wheels last week with notices giving stu-dents ﬁ  ve days to remove the markers before their bikes were impounded.
UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb said the bikes were removed by 
physical plant employees and taken in dump trucks to a plant compound on campus.
Owners can claim their bikes within 30 days after they are removed before they are given to UF Surplus Warehouse to be auctioned. If a bike registered with UPD is collected, police will notify the owner.
He said there are usually three or four pickups a year. Pick-
ups in Fall and Spring semesters are concentrated around class-room buildings.
Holcomb said students returning for summer shouldn’t 
leave their bikes behind either. Another pickup is planned for May 10 at UF residence halls.
In 2010, UPD collected almost 600 bikes left for summer, 
Holcomb said.UPD picked up about 240 unclaimed bicycles on campus MondaySEE CISE, PAGE 4SEE HELP, PAGE 4

The opening of Flaco’s Cuban Bakery and Coffee Spot’s second location in Midtown has been delayed 
due to permit issues.
� THE LOCATION MUST PASS 
INSPECTIONS.
MICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Permitting problems have delayed 
the opening of Flaco’s second location 
for nearly a month.
Flaco’s Cuban Bakery and Cof-
fee Spot planned to open a second location in Midtown before the end of March, but a miscommunication about whether the restaurant needed a gas permit has set back the opening date, said Sara Puyana, co-owner of the restaurant.
The Cuban-style restaurant plans 
to serve fried foods and have an or -
dering window to serve customers at the new location.
A contracted commercial-appli-
ance installer connected the new ven-ue’s stoves and fryers to an already existing gas line in the restaurant’s suite under the impression that a gas permit wouldn’t be required, Puyana said.
But without the permit, the res-
taurant wasn’t able to pass several inspections two weeks ago. Progress was stalled until the business received the permit last Friday.
“We had to reschedule all our in-
spections,” Puyana said. “We’re prac-tically going to have to open in the summer.”
Flaco’s received its gas permit 
from Gainesville Regional Utilities on Friday of last week. The restaurant’s final fire and mechanical inspections will be conducted this week, Puyana said. Flaco’s will also have to test its fire-suppression system before open-ing.
Flaco’s staff plans to have the 
opening inspection for the new loca-tion with the Florida Health Depart-ment on Friday , Puyana said. The restaurant could open immediately after passing the inspection, but Puy-ana wants to wait until next week to prepare the kitchen.
“It’s definitely been heartbreak-
ing,” she said about the delays. Permit problems delay

Breathe in, breathe out.
That’s the strategy that Jane Emmeree, 
a health promotion specialist with Gator -
Well, recommends as the best relief for added stress that comes with finals week.
“The goal with managing stress during 
finals is to understand that even a short break where you take slow, deep breaths or do something effective to decrease the stimulation in your body will help,” she said.
According to Emmeree, stress is a bio-logical and physiological response that alerts the body and puts it into its “fight-or-flight” mode. Actively telling your body to slow down is the best way to get it to relax.
She said stress negatively impacts aca-
demic performance because it can cause difficulty sleeping and edgy feelings, affect the ability to concentrate and result in less memory retention. Exercise, meditation, guided imagery, progressive relaxation and listening to music can help, too, she said.
Tina Tannen, a clinical assistant profes-
sor with the Counseling and Wellness Cen-ter, encouraged stressed students to hone their time-management skills. She suggest-ed looking at where the time is really go-ing: Facebook and other networking sites 
can cut into study time.
Contrary to the be-
havior of many college students, Tannen said all-nighters are “kind of a waste of time.”
Studies show sleep de-
privation hinders mem-ory because the brain re-tains information during 
the sleep cycle, she said.
Lauren Black, an 18-year-old pre-med freshman, said she often pulls all-nighters.
She said she does her best studying dur -
ing the night and at odd hours when there are fewer distractions.
For Black, the best way to cope with the 
stress of finals is to just push through.
Emmeree said long-term stress that’s 
not managed well can lead to future health problems. It can cause the immune system to be more compromised and can ultimate-ly contribute to diseases such as cancer and heart disease.
More stress-reducing tips can be found 
on the Counseling and Wellness Center’s website.
Short breaks are the best answers to finals week stress, experts say

A Gainesville man briefly locked his 1-year-
old and 2-year-old children in his house on Sun-
day.
Jorge Quinones, 29, was arrested on charges of 
child neglect Sunday around 9:15 p.m.
Quinones passed the mother of their children 
on his bike after he left the house and told her to get “her kids,” according to an Alachua County Sheriff’s Office arrest report.
When she got to the house, the doors were 
locked and she had no way of getting in. She called the police.
After Dep. Barrett Boyette, an Alachua Coun-
ty Sheriff’s officer, got to the house, he and the childrens’ mother heard the 1-year-old through the door, but not the 2-year-old.Worried about the children, Officer Boyette 
broke the door down and found both children unharmed.
When inside, according to the report, the of-
ficer found an open can of beer and a cigarette lighter where the children could reach them.
Another officer found Qui-
nones biking on Archer Road.
According to the police re-
port, after Boyette read Qui-nones his Miranda rights, Qui-nones refused to speak to him 
and appeared “completely unconcerned with the situation,” but he did keep repeating, “This is bullshit.”
The mother said her husband left the children 
alone before, but she didn’t report it.

Two Interstate 75 exit ramps 
in Gainesville will be closed this 
week for construction, which may cause some traffic congestion on the interstate.
The northbound exit ramp onto 
Newberry Road will be closed from 9 p.m. today until 5 a.m. Wednesday. The southbound exit ramp onto Newberry Road will be closed Wednesday from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m. Thursday.
Traffic will be detoured to ei-
ther Archer Road or Northwest 39th Avenue during the ramp clo-sures.
The Florida Department of 
Transportation paid D.A.B. Con-structors Inc. $2.2 million to com-plete the project.
The ramps will close to allow 
workers to continue to work on the exits. The project to improve the ramps began last March.
Laurie Windham, spokes-
woman for the project, said two new lanes will be added to the northbound exit. The other three ramps have been resurfaced, but the southbound ramp needs extra paving.

The Student Senate is scheduled 
to hear two bills today that pro-
pose to cut and restructure parts of Student Government’s executive branch that deal with SG programs.Student Body President-elect Tj 
Villamil said the bills will downsize the vice president’s cabinet to 17 cabinets and consolidate agencies. According to the SG statutes, there are 23 programming cabinets.
The Cabinet Reorganization Act 
proposes to cut the six divisions of the cabinet to three. If the bill passes, then leadership, campus and diver -
sity divisions will remain, Villamil said.
Two of the cabinets being cut, ad-
vertising and public relations, would become part of the proposed Action SG agency to promote SG and its or -ganizations. Some cabinet positions would be added.
“We’re doing a lot more down-
sizing and consolidation,” Villamil said.
The Agency Reorganization Act 
proposes consolidating the agencies. The only one to be cut is the Gator Health and Safety Agency , Villamil said. He said other services on cam-pus provide the same thing.Students can apply for 98 posi-
tions in the executive branch, ac-cording to the SG website. The cur -
rent applications, due Monday at 5 p.m., are available online.
Villamil said he didn’t have num-
bers of how many positions were be-ing cut.
“There are the same amount of 
duties, just with less official director -
ship and heads,” he said.

Counseling & Wellness Center available for students who need help
more hours. She said she should have called during the drive 
home.
“I wish we just could have had that connection, even just to 
bring a little peace to him, even if it wouldn’t have changed his decision,” she said. “I feel like I failed him as a friend.”
In one of those texts to Marks on Sunday , Edmonds said 
he was struggling to justify living. But he had told her that before, she said. He seemed less panicked on Sunday than he did in the past.
Marks said she doesn’t blame herself, that she understands 
she couldn’t have stopped him. But the question of “what if” still haunts her, which is common for those close to someone who committed suicide, said Sherry Benton, director of the UF Counseling & Wellness Center.
“This is one of the hardest things you can possibly go through,” she said. “It’s just awful. If you’re someone who loved Michael, it’s easy to think, ‘I should have done more. I should have done more. I should have done more.’ I want 
those people to know it’s not their fault.”
Benton said students contemplating sui-
cide should call the Counseling & Wellness Center at 352-392-1575. The center is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, and a counselor is on call for those who need it, any time of day.
The center offers about 20 different types 
of therapy groups, Benton said. Counselors also work with UF faculty and staff, train-
ing them to identify suicidal students.
But even if someone takes his or her own life, friends and 
family should not blame themselves, Benton said.
Suicide is complicated. It can’t be traced to one event, one breakup or one moment of anger, according to the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention. About 90 percent of suicide victims have a significant psychiatric illness at the time of their death.
Dustin White, the secretary of Team Florida Cycling, said 
he met Edmonds when Edmonds joined the club in August. From the beginning of their relationship, Edmonds was un-ashamed and talked freely about his struggles. White knew Edmonds was frustrated — he suffered a back injury during a bike crash in February , and on Saturday he was arrested for driving under the influence.
Still, White never expected Edmonds would take his own 
life.
“It seems like it happened all so quick,” he said. “He was 
open with everyone, so we didn’t see the seriousness in recent conversations … nothing went off like an alarm to anyone.”

Group to hold sit-in today
“How are we supposed to run a 
computer science department without 
a systems support staff?” she said.
After walking around the CSE 
building several times, the crowd of students chanted and marched down Stadium Road to Weil Hall, where they demanded to speak to Aber -
nathy.
Associate Dean Jennifer Curtis 
came out to address the group’s de-mands, including the group’s desire to take part in the final decision-mak-ing by way of a vote.
Curtis said that the protesters 
might have a misconception of what shared governance means.
“Shared governance does not mean 
collective decision-making,” she told the crowd. “So a decision does have to be made, and a decision will be made by the dean.”Curtis also said the group’s re-
quest to move the final day to accept input on Abernathy’s proposal from Wednesday to June 15 cannot work because of the UF administration’s re-quirements for reporting budgets.
In a statement released Monday af-
ternoon, Abernathy said she plans to meet with college faculty leadership and student leadership organizations like the Benton Engineering Council to discuss the proposal.
“I cannot emphasize enough that I, 
as the dean of college of engineering, feel exactly the same way as everyone out there regarding the budget cut that has been placed upon us by the state,” she said.
The group will hold a sit-in today 
outside Abernathy’s office in Weil Hall from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.

Students now have more options 
for buying top-brand shoes on a mac-
n-cheese budget.
Designer Shoe Warehouse, bet-
ter known as DSW, will open its first Gainesville location today in the Oaks Square plaza on Newberry Road, near the Oaks Mall. 
The building will house about 
25,300 pairs of discount designer shoes, said Randy Guenot, superin-tendent of the renovation project by A. F. Alber Retail Contractors.
DSW’s goal was to create a signa-
ture look and make every location similar. The Gainesville store has the striped awning and warehouse look like the other stores, Guenot said.
DSW will join six other stores in the 
shopping center, said Rebecca Yates, director of property management for the plaza. She said the grand opening will be on Thursday.
Discount shoe store Famous Foot-
wear is located next door to the new DSW location. With the opening of the store, assistant manager Ryan Kir -
by said he anticipates Famous Foot-wear’s sales to decrease temporarily but to eventually level off.
The store is looking to potentially 
relocate to Archer Road by Novem-ber, said Kirby, a 22-year-old junior public relations major.
Famous Footwear’s stock includes athletic, dress, casual and children’s shoes, he said. The store, which has about 20,000 shoes in its 10,439 square feet of retail space, has been in the same location for 13 years, Kirby said.
Other city shoe stores also have 
concerns about DSW opening in Gainesville.  
Duke Pinner, owner of Pinner’s 
Fine Shoes, said he carries higher quality shoes than the discount shoe giant. The store opened on the corner of West University Avenue and South-west 34th Street about 45 years ago.
Pinner said his store and DSW ca-
ter to different audiences. He said his smaller store is able to provide cus-tomer service and extra sizes that the big-box stores don’t carry.
The building that will house DSW 
formerly held Borders, a national bookstore chain that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2011. The store laid off about 20 employees when it was shut down.
Spirit Halloween temporarily used 
the space after Borders closed. Nego-tiations to put DSW in the building began in late 2011.
“We were sad when Borders closed, 
and we had a dark spot in the shop-ping center,” Rebecca Yates said.
She said DSW’s arrival will boost 
business in the plaza and around the mall area.
“DSW brought that life back,” she 
said.Top-brand shoe store to

Alligator looking for 
summer columnists
As the end of the semester draws near and everyone 
is making summer plans, we wanted to throw some-thing out there for those who will be sticking around in 
Gainesville for the next few months.
During the summer semester, although many will be leav-
ing because of graduation, internships or the need to return to the nest for the comfort of family and friends back home, the Alligator will still be here.
For those who don’t know, the Alligator publishes two days 
a week — Tuesdays and Thursdays — during the summer.
This means we need students to help us fill up our opinions 
pages with well-thought-out analyses and commentary about current events.
Or they can write about how their life is like a trip to Taco 
Bell.
We’re looking for strong writers who want to share their 
views on issues, whether they be on a campus-wide, local, state or national level.
Because we only publish two days a week this summer, we 
only have four weekly columnist spots to fill.
If you’re interested in becoming a weekly columnist, you 
will need to submit a resume, a brief cover letter explaining why you think you’re a good fit for our opinions pages and a short explanation of your political persuasion, i.e. conserva-tive, liberal, libertarian, socialist, etc.
If you have been published before or keep a blog, please 
send us three examples of your finest work.
If you have not been published before, you can send us two 
writing samples about different topics. These samples should be between 500 and 600 words.
Columns should take a stand, be clear and be about things 
that students at UF might care about.
If you apply and do not make the cut for the summer, we 
still strongly encourage you to submit material. We will be ac-cepting guest columns and letters to the editor throughout the summer.
The more we are familiar with your work, the more likely 
we are to consider you for a weekly columnist position in the future.
Guest columns should be between 500 and 600 words and 
need to include your name, year, major and the school you at-tend.
Feel free to write response columns to our weekly colum-
nists or come up with your own topic.
Letters should be between 150 and 200 words and need to 
include your name and any other relevant information, i.e. ma-jor, organizations you belong to, etc.
All materials for columnist applications should be sent as an 
attachment to opinions@alligator.org.
Please submit all applications by April 28.Future guest columns and letters should also be sent to the 
same address.
We look forward to hearing from you.Is the “Buffett Rule” too much to ask?
Since last summer, calls to mobilize the 99 percent 
have been heard from Wall Street to the Vatican, amassing one of the greatest peaceful global demon-
strations in history.
In logical (though not necessarily principled) oppo-
sition to the demonstrators is the 1 percent, built up to appear as a club of multimillionaire moguls nestled com-fortably in Porsches, penthouses and Parisian escorts.
But the truth about the wealth of the 1 percent is often 
misconceived and overblown, and it causes a subsequent misunderstanding of the scope and intent of the Buffett rule and other similarly proposed tax legislation.
The Buffett rule (named after Warren Buffett’s frustra-
tion at paying a lower tax rate than his secretary) proposes that those who make $1 million a year should pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. Many object to this rule, claiming that it will stifle job growth and cause mil-lionaire business owners to tighten up their spending. But if this legislation were enacted, just more than 0.1 percent of taxpayers would actually have increased taxes.
Contrary to what many believe, the 1 percent is not 
part of the multimillionaire’s club reserved for Mitt Rom-ney and the rest of the 0.1 percent. The threshold for being a member of the 1 percent in 2009 was $343,927 (a fair wealth, no doubt, but nowhere near the affluence I had expected). Taking this into consideration, the Buffett rule would have no impact on the majority of the 1 percent or the vast majority of job creators.
That’s because — again, contrary to what many be-
lieve — most American jobs are not created by large com-panies and corporations (many of which continue to out-source jobs yearly) but are actually created by start-ups. While these start-ups already receive some tax benefits, if we truly want to cultivate a job-creating culture we need to look more and more toward new and small businesses and less toward the large companies that consistently lure away their customers.
This support needs to come not only from the govern-
ment but also from consumers. Rather than shopping at Publix or Chipotle, spend a few more dollars for your groceries at Wards and get your burrito from Burrito Bros. We’re lucky to have such a wealth of small businesses in Gainesville, and we’d be wise not to neglect it.
The 210,000 taxpayers who 
would experience a higher tax rate following the Buffett rule are hardly the job creators the 
Republicans herald them as. Though many are currently at a 35-percent tax rate, much (if not all) of their income comes through dividends and capital gains, leaving their taxes somewhere between 15 and 20 percent.
Are we naive enough to believe that the difference 
between that 15-percent rate and Buffett’s proposed 30-percent rate is finding its way back into the job market, creating work and stimulating the economy for the less well-off?
An astounding degree of homelessness and hunger 
still plagues our nation. Charities and donations have been responsive to these issues, but they have not pre-vented them. The very top income earners should be ea-ger to give back to society and an economy that undoubt-edly aided them in gaining the wealth they have.
No one is truly self-made. No one succeeds “against 
all odds” (the fact that you succeed shows some odds in your favor). Those who claim that the unsuccessful have only themselves to blame fail to recognize that the “American dream” is not what it used to be. No matter how determined, millions of Americans cannot and will not achieve a sustainable lifestyle without some external intervention.
Charitable donations are helpful, but they are volun-
tary and too often myopic. While taxes aren’t always al-located perfectly, with 46.2 million Americans in poverty and a government more than $15 trillion in debt, a 30-per -
cent income tax is the least the wealthy can cough up.

The anticipation builds as everyone’s favorite time of 
year inches closer.
No, I’m not talking about summer break; I’m talking, 
of course, about the fantastic upcoming presidential election!
If you can’t note the sarcasm in my previous sentence and 
are actually excited about voting for one of the two presiden-tial nominees, you need to wake up.
There’s no trying to make sense out of our candidates and 
their platforms or mask it with false optimism; we’re screwed, plain and simple. 
The fairy tale of a prosperous America ended once the 
Baby Boomers began talking about Social Security as if it were an endangered species.
That’s why in a hyper, fashionably radical and polarized 
nation, there’s never been a better time to be an independent.
Loyalty to a political party is dead. The mutiny on both ends of the political spectrum is bar-
baric. 
Politicians are more preoccupied with their re-election 
than the welfare of their constituents.
Being uncommitted has never looked so appealing, and 
sanity has never been so scarce. 
Never before have we faced an election that, from the get-
go, looked so bleak.
Four years ago, our country found itself on the brink of 
disaster with everything swirling down the economic toilet. We put our trust in the hands of a young, multiracial senator to bring some of that promised hope and change to Washing-ton. 
It’s not like things would have been better with McCain in 
ofﬁ  ce, anyway.
Fast forward a few years later, and 
we remain in a sour economy, a dis-mal job market, in debt up to our eye-balls with the Chinese and a health care reform bill that after two years still teeters on the seesaw of the Su-preme Court.
On the list of the things President 
Obama did get around to accom-plishing: withdrawing from Iraq and 
making the world safer from one less terrorist. 
While both feats are signiﬁ  cant, they aren’t enough to ap-
pease constituents who depended on “hope” and “change.”
Obama’s re-election is far from a given.Let’s face it: Mitt Romney will be the Republican nomi-
nee. 
With Santorum out of the rat race that originally started off 
with what felt like 200 pathetic contenders who thought it’d be cool to drop their name into the hat (anyone else miss Her-man Cain, Michele Bachmann and Donald Trump?), the only ones left standing to challenge Romney are Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul.
Gingrich’s been out of the political game for a while, and 
Paul makes too much sense for America.
Romney, who fell to John McCain in the 2008 Republican 
nomination, was once heralded as a centrist. But as Romney was forced to drink the right-wing Kool-Aid to win over Re-publican voters, he sacriﬁ  ced his reputation and switched his stance on many issues dear to true conservatives.
To quote my favorite movie, “Juno,” which conveniently 
includes the simile used by Romney’s campaign manager: “That ain’t no Etch-A-Sketch. That’s one doodle that can’t be undid.”
Voting is a hard-fought right that should be exercised by 
every American, but don’t be shocked if you ﬁ  nd yourself in the voting booth muttering “eenie, meenie, miney, moe…” — that might just be the best way to do it.
Hold your breath and wisely pick the candidate you think 
you can stomach for the next four years, assuming our coun-try won’t be usurped by China by then.

opinions@alligator.orgPickings are slim for 
presidential electionColumn
As a computer science major in the College of En-
gineering, I ﬁ  nd Dean Cammy Abernathy’s plan to restructure the computer and information ser-
vice engineering department both disturbing and illogi-cal. 
In her proposal, she claims that applying any portion 
of the budget cuts to the other departments in the col-
lege would drive them toward mediocrity , but what she fails to realize is that the drastic cuts she is proposing for CISE would leave it in shambles.
In her budget plan, she proposes the following: mov-
ing all computer engineering (CEN) majors (and most of 
the advising staff) to the electrical and computer engi-neering (ECE) department; moving approximately half of the CISE faculty to unrelated departments (including ECE, Biomedical Engineering [BME], and Industrial Sys-tems Engineering [ISE]); eliminating staff positions that support research and graduate programs; and eliminat-ing teaching assistant positions.
This proposal, if approved, would effectively end all 
research in CISE, phase out the Ph.D. program and leave the department struggling to support its undergraduate students.
I do not believe Dean Abernathy is guided by ma-
licious intent, but I do believe her rationale is ﬂ  awed and she is either ignorant of or unable to recognize the importance of the work conducted in the CISE depart-ment.
Her main arguments for this proposal seem to be that 
CISE has a higher number of TAs compared to the rest of the engineering departments and there is a substan-tial amount of overlap between CISE and ECE in regard to the administration of computer engineering majors. Quite frankly, these are weak arguments that do not jus-tify the dissolution of the CISE department.
Part of the reason CISE has so many TAs is that the 
department conducts a substantial amount of research responsible not only for bringing in grant money , but also for attracting graduate students and professors from around the world to our university . The money brought in by this research is used to hire TAs and sup-port them in their pursuit of Ph.Ds. This research is re-sponsible both for producing the advanced technologies of tomorrow and for driving Ph.D students to become experts in their ﬁ  eld.
Dean Abernathy’s plan to pull the plug on CISE re-
search would severely compromise the department. The potential to bring in grant money will be gone, gradu-ate students would not have the opportunity to pursue Ph.Ds within the department and there wouldn’t be any TAs remaining to assist professors in administering undergraduate-level classes, which would reduce the quality of said classes.
The overlap between CISE 
and ECE is not so signiﬁ  cant 
that it would be wise to lump the two departments to-gether. 
Although computer engineering majors take a hand-
ful of the same courses as electrical engineering (EE) ma-jors, these should not be considered so alike that they should be administered by the same department. There are many courses very speciﬁ  c to each major, and these courses cannot be taught by any professor who is picked arbitrarily from either department.
However, it seems that Dean Abernathy thinks the 
programs and the faculties of CISE and ECE are inter-changeable. 
In regard to the programs, it is more accurate to say 
the CEN majors with hardware specializations are simi-lar to the EE majors while the CEN majors with software specializations are similar to the computer science ma-jors offered by both CISE and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. If Dean Abernathy is so intent on merging CISE and ECE to eliminate overlap, perhaps she should just divide the CEN major into two distinct majors: com-puter hardware engineering (offered by ECE) and com-puter software engineering (offered by CISE).
The last thing I would like to point out in regard to 
these proposed cuts is that they have a serious potential for encouraging some of the best CISE professors to leave and for deterring prospective students from pursuing degrees in CISE. Some of the best CISE professors are highly involved in research, and by eliminating support for the research programs, there would be little incentive for those professors to stay with UF much longer.
Dean Abernathy has stated she would do everything 
possible to keep these professors at UF, but realistically speaking, the professors who conduct research will likely seek employment elsewhere if another university offers them research opportunities that are not available at UF. 
Without these professors, the department will likely 
see decreased enrollment and fewer students will grad-uate with the highly sought skills possessed by CISE majors. 
Personally , I’m strongly reconsidering my desire to 
pursue a master’s degree in computer engineering here. I love UF, but there is no reason for me to stay here for a CISE graduate program when it looks as though the department may be torn apart by someone who does not recognize its potential.

Speaking Out8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 17, 2012
� THE PROGRAM WAS PROPOSED IN 2008.
KAYLANIE ALVAREZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
In 2008, a campus sustainability group considered a propos-
al for a student bicycle rental program in hopes of alleviating 
traffic on campus and offering an alternative to cars.
Four years later, what exists is a small departmental pro-
gram open only to faculty and staff.
The initial proposal, made in November 2008, called for 
multiple bike stations to be built around campus. Students would be able to rent a bicycle using a credit card or student ID, ride it and return it to any bike station on campus.
Despite similar successful programs on other college cam-
puses, such as the University of South Florida’s “Borrow Our Bikes” program, UF has not made any plans for expansion.
Scott Fox, director of transportation and parking services 
at UF, said several factors contributed to the decision to not implement the bike rental program.
“There would have to be a significant amount of labor on 
the part of the university to move these bikes around and re-queue them at the start of every day,” Fox said.UF’s Sustainable Transportation Working Group thought 
the project would be too labor-intensive and that bikes might end up in the middle of campus and not around the perimeter where people would want to see them.
Creating a department in charge of maintaining, retrieving 
and finding space for the bikes required more effort than any department could give at the time.
Transportation at UF is a separate auxiliary service, which 
doesn’t receive a budget or operating money from the univer -
sity, the state or Student Government.
UF transportation pays for new programs by trying to get 
more money from existing sources, Fox said.
Currently, parking decals are the primary revenue source 
for UF transportation.
In 2008, UF transportation looked into generating revenue 
for a bike program by raising the price of decals, but transpor -
tation and sustainability officials questioned if that was the best use of the extra money.
An increase in student interest could go a long way in mak-
ing the bike rental program more of a priority, Fox said.
“Students are the ones who said, ‘We want more bus ser -
vice, we want this SNAP service and we are willing to pay for it.’ That’s where the money came from to enhance those pro-grams and make them a reality ,” he said. “What we haven’t seen with the bicycle rental program is someone saying, ‘This is important and we are going to find a way to pay for it’.”
Alex Arias, a 22-year-old materials science and engineering 
senior, rides his bike to campus. He said the rental program would be helpful to students who live off campus but don’t want to take their bikes on the bus.
“If they could find a way of making it cheap, then it would 
be a great idea,” Arias said. “I see students using it, but I don’t expect a decrease in fossil fuels.”
The Office of Sustainability set up the Departmental Bike 
Program in Fall 2011 to prove the concept’s viability at UF, said Stephanie Sims, implementation coordinator of the UF Office of Sustainability.
The program reuses some of the hundreds of bicycles aban-
doned on campus by students. About 35 of these bicycles are refurbished and used by the Office of Sustainability’s green teams as departmental vehicles. They are available to faculty and staff who need to make deliveries or get to meetings as an alternative to using a state vehicle or their personal vehicles.
“It’s very expensive to start one of the bike-sharing pro-
grams as you picture in D.C. or down in Miami,” Sims said. “Unfortunately, there is no easy home for that at UF. With the budget cuts, there is no one that has a whole lot of money to get it started.”Bike rental program proposal lacks funding, falls flat with students

A 51-year-old man died after having two seizures in 
jail Sunday morning.
Officers woke Willie Joel Sanders in his Alachua Coun-
ty Jail cell at 5 a.m. Sunday so a nurse could check his 
blood-sugar levels, said Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Sgt. Todd Kelly.
An officer escorted Sanders to a common area to meet 
the nurse. She then left the room and while he was waiting for 
her to return, Sanders suffered a seizure, Kelly said.
Sanders remained conscious, but im-
mediately seized again.
After the second seizure, he didn’t 
wake up. Nurses and other jail staff per -
formed CPR but couldn’t revive him.
Alachua County Fire Rescue took 
Sanders to Shands at UF.
He was pronounced dead at 6:46 a.m. Sunday, Kelly said, adding that inmates are asked about their medical history when they are booked into the jail.
“Something in his initial medical screening prompted 
the nurses to check his blood,” Kelly said.
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office detectives are investi-
gating the cause of death.
Sanders was arrested Saturday morning on charges of 
possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. 
There was also a warrant out for his arrest due to un-
paid child support.

Florida junior catcher Mike Zunino throws to first during a game against LSU on April 7. Zunino was 
ranked by ESPN’s Keith Law as the nation’s No. 2 overall prospect for this year’s MLB Draft.
BRYAN HOLT
Alligator Writer
Kevin O’Sullivan knows it is com-
ing. All he can do is handle what he 
has until that time comes. 
“There’s a thing called the draft 
June 4, 5, 6, and it’s not an easy thing to manage,” Florida’s coach said. 
No college team will be affected by 
the 2012 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft more than the No. 5 Gators (28-8). ESPN baseball analyst Keith Law released his latest “Future 50” rankings last week, and the list is littered with familiar faces. 
Three players who made the cut 
will take the field for Florida at McK-ethan Stadium when UF  faces Georgia Southern (22-16) at 7 p.m. 
Catcher Mike Zunino leads the way 
as the No. 2 overall draft prospect in the nation behind only Baxley, Ga., high school senior Byron Buxton. Ac-cording to Law, most major-league scouts don’t see Zunino lasting past the No. 3 pick in the draft, which be-longs to the Seattle Mariners. 
Following Zunino is left-handed 
starting pitcher Brian Johnson, who is coming off a big Sunday against Ten-nessee that helped him earn South-eastern Conference Player of the Week honors. Johnson comes in at No. 24 on the list, described by Law as a “very safe college arm,” who “could reach the majors quickly because of the qual-ity of his off-speed stuff.” 
That’s two spots ahead of shortstop 
Nolan Fontana, who is another player Law believes is on the fast track to the major leagues because of his reliable defensive play and approach at the plate. Fontana showed his worth this past weekend with six hits and five walks in a three-game set against Ten-nessee. 
All three players are juniors, mean-
ing this is the first time they have had to deal with serious draft talk during their UF careers. 
“It’s something we talk about, ab-
solutely,” O’Sullivan said. “It’s every kid’s dream to play in the big leagues, and that’s a big day for them. The tim-ing of it is a little tough because it’s right in the middle of our season.” 
Aside from losing players it already 
has, Florida also has to focus on keep-ing the players it is trying to bring to campus. Two more players in Law’s top 50 are signed to play baseball at Florida. 
Tampa Jesuit right-handed pitcher 
Lance McCullers is projected as a fu-ture reliever by Law but comes in at No. 41 because of the possibility some team could view him as a starter and make him a late first-round pick. O’Sullivan has taken a number of trips to Tampa to watch McCullers pitch. 
Lewis Brinson, a  6-foot-4, 
180-pound Coral Springs High out-fielder with tons of raw athleticism, rounds out the list at No. 50. He turned heads when he won the home run der -
by at the Under Armour Classic but has plenty of development in store, ac-cording to Law. 
O’Sullivan said he understands 
that the draft brings added pressure to players but also expects them to handle it with maturity. He’s willing to talk it over with players to make sure it doesn’t affect the clubhouse.
“For some of these guys it is a big 
year,” he said. “There’s a lot of good players on this team, but we’re going to try to stay together as a group the best we can.” Gators facing MLB distractions ahead of midweek game

The Gators have one of the best pitching rotations in 
the nation, and they have the numbers to prove it.
Florida ranks fourth nationally with a 1.08 ERA and 
leads the Southeastern Conference in numerous pitching 
categories, including batting average against (.185) and fewest hits allowed (181).
Hannah Rogers, who has a 0.96 ERA and .176 batting average against, chalks up the Gators 
pitchers’ success to the defense.
“They always do an awesome job,” 
Rogers said. “I always thank them after every inning and every game just to help keep them up and their confidence.”
Statistically, Florida has the No. 2 de-
fense in the SEC behind Tennessee. The Gators rank second to the Volunteers 
with just 27 errors committed and a 97.7 fielding percent-age.
Rogers, who notched her 22nd win of the season in 
a 5-2 victory against Auburn on Sunday, benefited from solid defensive play. Shortstop Cheyenne Coyle was the first UF player to flash the leather Sunday when she made a diving catch on a pop-up in shallow left field, prevent-ing a bloop single from Auburn’s Amber Harrison in the top of the first.
“Cheyenne was making great plays out there at short-
stop, diving for things,” first baseman Lauren Haeger said. “We have great defense. Everyone in the field does their job and we don’t have a lot of errors against us.”Defense, pitching playing large role for third-ranked Florida

Auburn’s Caitlin Schultze is thrown out on a fielder’s choice as Florida shortstop Cheyenne Coyle (27) at-
tempts to turn a double play during the top of the fourth inning of Sunday’s 5-1 Florida win. .
Gators are 23-1 when 
committing zero errors in a game this season
Right fielder Kasey Fagan 
showed off her arm strength 
in the final two innings Sun-day, gunning down two run-ners from the outfield grass. In the top of the sixth, the Tigers’ Caitlin Jordan hit a line drive that Fagan played off a short hop. Fagan came up throwing and fired a strike to Haeger at first base, beating Jordan by a step.
“That play, it’s funny,” Fa-
gan said. “I was just going to tell Lauren the play before that, ‘If this girl hits it to me, I’m throwing it to you, try to get the out at first.’ Then that play happened, and it just happened so fast. I almost caught it so I just threw it to first as best as I could and I got her out. Coach (Tim Walton) looked pretty ex-cited, so I was pretty excited.”
In the next inning, Fagan 
couldn’t handle a two-out line drive off the bat of Auburn’s Lauren Guzman. However, Fagan recovered quickly and fired the ball to second where Katie Medina tagged out Guz-man to end the game.
“Our defense is so poised in 
any situation, and we’re able to come up with the big plays be-cause we’re relaxed and we’re able to play loose,” Fagan said.
Florida played mistake-free 
ball in its three-game sweep against Auburn, running its streak of games without an er -
ror to five. 
The Gators are 23-1 this sea-
son when they record a zero in the “E” column.
“We made some great plays 
on defense,” Walton said. “Pitching and defense is the name of the game.”

One week, they masquerade as national 
title contenders. The next, they play like 
pretenders. 
Finding an identity has been a season-
long task for the No. 10 Gators, one that will likely continue into this weekend’s Southeastern Conference Tournament. 
Florida (14-8, 7-4 SEC) has had impres-
sive wins and challenging losses, right up to the last week of the season. When they travel to Starkville, Miss., this weekend, not only will they be searching for a champion-ship, they will be looking to jell as a team.
“We are not a mature team with a lot 
of definition and security, knowing where points are going to come from. The consis-tency of the day is going to be the most im-portant thing,” coach Andy Jackson said.
“That’s always the case, but it’s even 
more the case when you have a little bit of non-identity with your team. You’re still searching for your identity even though you have talent, but you don’t know where the points are going to come from. 
“Until we solidify that, then everybody 
hitting on the same cylinders is going to be the key factor.”
UF has had flashes of brilliance this year. 
Even in losses, Jackson has seen bright spots. For instance, of the eight losses the team has suffered this year, six have been against teams currently ranked in the top 10. Of those losses, three were 4-3 deci-sions.
A priority for Jackson and the Gators is 
getting each player to perform at his top level. Doing so at the same time is a chal-lenge, but Jackson believes it is possible. Namely, he said, it involves being detail-oriented in practice.
“It’s something that coaches work on 
and talk about with our teams,” he said. “I think there is such a thing as luck in sports, but the teams that take care of a lot of de-tails and all try to play together on the same day are the ones that are getting luckiest. Sometimes we’ve been getting unlucky this year when it really isn’t un-luck — it’s a thing where we can do something.”
Senior Nassim Slilam echoed Jackson’s 
feelings, saying that for this year’s team to be successful, all players must find a way to play high-quality tennis simultaneously. To this point, there have been very few matches in which that has happened.
“My only concern is for us to be able to 
play well at the same time,” Slilam said. “We all played well this year at one point. We’re trying to play better at the same time. We have to do it like we did last year, bring-ing seven guys playing great. “
Embree wins SEC honor: For the sec-
ond time this year, junior Lauren Embree was named the SEC Player of the Week. Her 6-1, 6-1 victory over South Carolina’s Jaklin Alawi was Florida’s first point of the match. The Gators went on to defeat the Gamecocks 4-1. Undefeated in singles con-ference play, Embree also won the honor the week of March 5.TUESDAY, APRIL 17, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

WITH A THROW OF 56-4.25.
KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Writer
Florida’s track and field team is coming off 
a rare break. However, senior thrower Keely 
Medeiros was the one exception.
After a strong finish in shot put at the Flor -
ida Relays, Medeiros carried that momentum to the Seminole Invitational in Tallahassee where she had the best performance of her career, according to head coach Mike Hollo-way. 
The last-minute decision made by associ-
ate head coach Steve Lemke proved to be a good one.
“Coach Lemke wanted to take her to this 
competition because of the great practices she’s been having,” Holloway said. “Actu-ally, she had the best series of her life. All her throws were fair throws, so it was a great weekend for Keely.”
Medeiros’ winning throw on Saturday was 
her second win since coming off an injury she suffered during summer international compe-tition. It was also her first win of the outdoor season. 
Although she has had eight top-five fin-
ishes in shot put this year, it’s not hard to see that Medeiros is continually improving as she works back from her injury. 
Her throw of 51 feet, 5 inches at the first 
meet during the indoor season paled in com-parison to her throw of 54 feet, 2.5 inches throw two months later at the beginning of the outdoor season. Still, both were overshad-owed by Saturday’s monster throw of 56 feet, 4.25 inches. 
“We’ve been very pleased with her prog-
ress,” Holloway said. 
“She had an injury during the fall that 
didn’t allow her to throw and lift as she need-ed too. [But] her strength levels are getting back.”
Not only was Saturday’s performance a 
season best, but also a new outdoor personal record. Medeiros passed her previous mark by almost two feet, indicating that Medeiros might be returning to where she was prior to her injury.
Medeiros wasn’t the only one to impress 
Holloway last week. He praised the team as a whole for maintaining their focus despite having the weekend 
off after their big home meet.
“Anytime we have a week off it’s a chal-
lenge for the athletes, especially coming off the Florida Relays,” Holloway said. “I was very proud of everyone in the program as a whole because they came out, they accepted the challenge of the workouts last week, they showed up on time, they were diligent in their work habits and work ethic, and it made our jobs a lot easier last week.  
“We’re always worried a little bit with 
coming off Florida Relays with the emotion that we put in that meet that they’ll be a little bit flat, but we had none of that last week.”Medeiros posts personal best in 
shot put at Seminole Invitational “I think there is such a thing as 
luck in sports, but the teams that 
take care of a lot of details and all 
try to play together on the same day 
are the ones that are getting lucki-
est.”

Florida coach Rhonda Faehn said she has taken a different approach this year 
with certain gymnasts to ensure that her team is ready for the postseason.

LANDON WATNICK

Staying durable for the long haul has been 
the theme all season for the Gators. 
Last year at the NCAA Championships, 
UF struggled to make it through the grueling 
stretch at season’s end, falling short of advanc-ing to the Super Six by only .075. In the semifi-nals, numerous minor injuries added up as the team tallied four scores of 9.6 or less. 
But this postseason, the Gators are feeling 
fresher than ever.  
“They’re in a better situation physically 
than in years past,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “That doesn’t mean that they’re all pain-free. They’re managing it really well.”
From the start of 2012, Faehn and the coach-
ing staff have kept a keen eye on their gym-nasts’ injuries. UF’s management of its athletes has led to more continuity in the lineups than in previous seasons, especially in its last few meets. 
Sophomores Alaina Johnson (elbow, ribs 
and shins) and Mackenzie Caquatto (ankles)  have dealt with nagging injuries. UF rested Johnson from all-around action on four of her first six meets. Caquatto didn’t see uneven bars until Jan. 20 against Kentucky. 
But now, the two are peaking. At the Southeastern Conference Champion-
ships and NCAA Regionals, Johnson averaged an all-around score of 39.48, while Caquatto held a 9.875 average on bars. 
“They’re extremely tough competitors,” 
Faehn said. “They’ve dealt with this for many years, and they’ve been a part of champion-ships where you have to compete day after day. At that point when they’re up (at nationals), the adrenaline will take over and will probably minimize any sort of pain they’re feeling.”
When No. 1 seed Florida competes at the 
evening session of the NCAA Championships semifinal Friday at 6 p.m., it will feature simi-lar event lineups to the rest of the season.
Faehn said senior Nicole Ellis (hip), who 
vaulted well in practice earlier this week, could see action this weekend on vault.
“You never know,” Faehn said. “In a couple 
of days, we’ll make the evaluation.”
The Gators will leave for The Arena at 
Gwinnett Center in Duluth, Ga., on Wednes-day and have their practice session Thursday afternoon. Florida’s semifinal opponents in-clude Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Ohio State and Oregon State.
If UF makes it to the Super Six, its endur -
ance would be put to the test Saturday at 4 p.m. Faehn said the team would be prepared for the short gap between competitions if it ad-vanced. 
“Really, at that point, it’s more mental,” she 
said. “If an athlete is strong mentally, a differ -
ence between three hours, four hours or five hours recovery should be extremely minimal. 
“But of course, our goal is to go out and 
have a great competition Friday night, to ad-vance, get them out of the arena as quickly as possible, get them rehabbing and get them to bed, so they can prepare for the next meet.” Gators physically ready for NCAAs
