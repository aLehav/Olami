Now facing a bribery conviction, former Israeli Prime 
Minister Ehud Olmert canceled his appearance for Accent 
Speaker’s Bureau next week.
On Monday, Olmert was convicted of receiving bribes 
during his time as mayor of Jerusalem.
Olmert was scheduled for an interview on April 9 with 
MSNBC foreign policy contributor Rula Jebreal at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
Accent chairman Daniel Landesberg said the bureau was 
not given a reason for his cancellation. But if Olmert still wanted to speak at UF, even with his conviction, Accent would have allowed it.
“We strive to bring controversial speakers,” he said. “If he 
still wanted to come, we would have had him.”
Accent had not yet paid Olmert and Jebreal their com-
bined $45,000 for the event.
The bribery conviction is not Olmert’s ﬁ  rst time facing 
charges.
Olmert resigned as prime minister in 2009 after corrup-
tion charges were made in another case.
Rami Okasha, a 21-year-old UF electrical engineering ju-
nior, said that because of Olmert’s past, he was offended that 
Accent had decided to bring him to UF.
“I think it’s wrong,” said Okasha, president of Students 
for Justice in Palestine. “Why should they be giving a per-
son like that the platform to speak, even if he was the prime minister?”  
Accent does not have a speaker lined up to replace Olmert 
and Jebreal.
Amanda Tankel, a 21-year-old UF ﬁ  nance junior, said she 
is disappointed that the event was canceled.
“I was really excited about it,” she said. “When I found 
out it was canceled, I jumped to the worst conclusion. If they 
were canceling it because of the protests against an Israeli 
ofﬁ  cial coming to speak, that’s where my issue would have 
lied.”

Following a federal decision that 
ruled football players at Northwest-
ern University count as employees, UF President Bernie Machen is look-ing for ways to get the university’s 
student athletes paid.
Football players from Northwest-
ern petitioned the university to allow them to unionize, 
which the Chicago National Labor 
Relations Board ruled in favor of. Peter Ohr, the board’s regional director, found student athletes receiving grant-in-
aid scholarships are employees of the university, giving them the right to unionize.
During last week’s Board of Trust-
ees meeting, Machen discussed what the decision means for UF. 
Machen said that he’s been in-
volved in negotiations with the Na-tional Collegiate Athletic Association about the organization’s cap on ath-letic scholarships for about a year. 
The NCAA limits how much a 
university can award student ath-letes, which Machen said ranges from $15,000 to $16,000 — which falls Machen aims to pay athletes

WERE RELATED TO SEX.

Florida ranked second in the country for 
harassment and discrimination in the work-
place complaints. 
In a report by The Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission, Florida had a total of 7,597 harassment and discrimination charges for 2013. That makes up about 8 percent of the total discrimination and harassment charges 
in the U.S. Texas snagged ﬁ  rst place while 
California followed in third.
Overall, the U.S. received about 94,000 
charges in 2013, which is about 6,000 fewer than in 2012. 
The Network, a company that specializes 
in governance, risk and compliance solutions, analyzed the 2013 report and illustrated trends in discrimination and harassment charges in Florida in an infographic.
Of the total charges in Florida, about 33 
percent were race charges, about 30 percent 
were sex charges, and 40 percent were retali-ation charges. 
Jimmy Lin, the vice president of product 
management and corporate development of The Network, said the most common harass-
ment charges ﬁ  led are retaliation, race and sex. He said the ﬁ  rst step in combating charges is implementing solid codes of conduct in the workplace.

IN MEMORIAM
BEATRICE DUPUY
Alligator Staff Writer bdupuy@alligator.org
Scott Nygren was serious about his love 
for the humanities. But the UF English and 
ﬁ  lm studies professor wasn’t the least bit 
serious around those who knew him.  
Nygren’s wife of 28 years, UF English 
professor Maureen Turim, worked down the hall from him in Turlington. She said when they ﬁ  rst met at a ﬁ  lm conference, 
she thought he was too stoic.  
“We would joke about that afterward,” 
she said.
Turim lost her husband this past week 
to his battle with cancer. Nygren was 67.
Sickness could not silence Nygren, the 
director of UF’s Center for Film and Media Studies. He wrote personal essays on his 
Facebook during his stay in the hospital.
“Although I am isolated from other pa-
tients due to risk of infection, the Internet 
connects me to family and friends and to competing discourses in contemporary so-
ciety,” he wrote.
While Nygren was in the hospital, he 
sent one of his students a video he had 
taken of him performing at a concert, said 
Nick Mendez, a 21-year-old UF English ju-
nior.
“It was such a personal thing to receive,” 
he said. “His commitment to being overly positive in the face of death was incredibly 
powerful.”
Nygren always wore his signature grin, 
said Ohio State associate professor Roger 
Beebe, who spent more than 13 years work-ing with Nygren at UF.
“When I see him in my head, he has this 
giant smile,” he said. “He convinced a lot of us he was going to beat this thing.”
Nygren’s legacy will live on at UF, 
where he was chairman of the Faculty Sen-ate and a member of the Board of Trustees from 2011 to 2012. He was also involved in 
the presidential search.
Nygren was generous with his time and 
ideas to help the campus community, said 
Kenneth Kidd, UF English department chairman.
“He was a really important part of our faculty,” he said. “He was one of those 
people who contributed on every level. It’s 
a huge loss for us, and he will be signiﬁ  -cantly missed.”
Nygren’s love of the humanities did not 
stop at his work. He often attended ﬁ  lm screenings, conferences and lectures, and he always asked questions.
He fostered a sense of community with-
in the English department, said UF assis-
tant professor Anastasia Ulanowicz.“He was very concerned with the state 
of our department and the importance of 
the humanities,” she said. “His champion-ship of humanities has strengthened my own commitment to the importance of hu-
manities within the university.”
To commemorate her husband, Turim 
started a memorial fund for graduate stu-
dents in the English department.
During his time at UF, Nygren taught 
classes on introduction to ﬁ  lm criticism and theory, avant-garde ﬁ  lm, documentary ﬁ  lm and video production.  
Nygren even wrote a book called “Time 
Frames: Japanese Cinema and the Unfold-ing of History.”
Turim said she and Nygren loved watch-
ing Japanese ﬁ  lms together.
Although cinema was more than what 
brought Turim and her husband together, it was a large part of their lives.
The couple spent their free time at the 
Hippodrome State Theatre and RISK Cin-
ema ﬁ  lm nights at the Samuel P. Harn Mu-
seum of Art. Turim said the two of them loved traveling as well.
“We did a lot of traveling together, and 
he would always plan everything out,” Tu-
rim said. “I’m a little spontaneous. I love 
the mixture of when I could convince him that we should do something he hadn’t planned on, and it would be spectacular.”  
Although Turim and her husband kept 
separate presences at work, their lives were intertwined. 
Without her movie aﬁ  cionado, travel 
companion, colleague, best friend and hus-
band, Turim will now have to go on alone.
“Life was our project together,” she 
said.Professor Scott Nygren remembered for passion, zest for life

and how to appropriately respond to 
these situations should they arise in the workplace,” he wrote in an email.
Cecil Howard, the equal opportu-
nity director for Gainesville’s Office 
of Equal Opportunity, said awareness 
is the top reason harassment charges are so high in Florida.
“Most people (in Florida) are 
aware of their rights to file complaints against employers, and certainly more are going to take advantage of that opportunity,” he said. “You basi-cally have protection on three levels 
in Florida — local, state and federal — where in some states you may only 
have protection at the federal level.” 
Though Florida is still ranked 
second in the nation for charges, the 
number of complaints has decreased 
by about 350 from 2012. In fact, since 2011, the number of complaints has declined by about 500 total com-plaints.
Lin credits the drop in complaints 
to extra efforts from employers on training programs and informing workers on how they can combat ha-
rassment.
“Instilling strong ethics in employ-
ees from day one is crucial in estab-
lishing an ethical workplace that’s free of harassment and discrimina-tion,” Lin said.ALEJANDRA ESCOBAR

Students on a budget may have an an-
swer to rising movie ticket prices.
The Hippodrome State Theatre is now 
offering students and senior citizens a 
discount to all of its regularly scheduled shows.
The discount allows students and se-
niors aged 65 and older to pay $5.50 for 
tickets with valid identification. Previous-
ly, the Hippodrome offered the discount to students and seniors only on Sundays and Wednesdays. On other days, tickets were $7.50.
Hippodrome cinema director Alisha 
Kinman said the theater wanted to make ticket prices consistent. Kinman said the change came after some recent restructur-ing and analyzing of the ticket prices.
“It just made sense to me that we should 
have student prices, and senior prices for that matter, be for all of our regular show-ings,” Kinman said. “We’re so close to the university that it would be silly for us not to do that.”
The implementation of the discount is 
not a sign that the Hippodrome is undergo-
ing any financial instability, she said.
In fact, Kinman said the Hippodrome 
is expanding its options with new digital 
equipment that debuted in January.
“I wanted to really evaluate all the stu-
dent, or not just student, but all the pricing that we have because I know it’s so expen-sive to go to the movies in general,” Kin-man said.
Allison Alsup, a 22-year-old UF public 
relations senior and intern at the Hippo-drome, said the lower ticket price will al-low more students to come to the cinema.
“It’s available more days of the week, so 
they don’t have to plan so far ahead if they want to come see a film that we’re show-ing,” Alsup said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 1, 2014

UF is considering replacing e-
Learning, leaving a blank canvas for 
the university’s new course manage-ment system.
Canvas, the proposed replace-
ment, is already in use for some UF business and online classes, but the school is determining whether it wants to transition all classes to the platform.
Randy Graff, a director of edu-
cational technology for UF Health, said Canvas’ simplicity and usabil-ity are its most attractive characteris-
tics, particularly for students.
“From what I understand, [Can-
vas] was actually built from a stu-
dent perspective,” Graff said. “With that in mind, Canvas has a leg up on Sakai.”The system is built to work with 
tools like Google Docs and can no-tify students of class updates and announcements by text or email.
“It empowers you to receive 
communication the way that you want to consume it,” Graff said.
According to student and faculty 
feedback, the layout of Canvas is much easier to navigate, he said. 
Warner Olson, a UF industrial 
engineering student, said he has ex-perienced issues with e-Learning.“I have no clue where I’m sup-
posed to be going for certain things,” he said. “Everything is there; it’s just 
not easily accessible.”
Although the student feedback for Canvas has been positive, other 
students have differing opinions about whether a new course man-agement system is needed.
Other students like Mel Tutar, a 
UF industrial engineering student, said other than e-Learning freezing 
sometimes, she thinks the system 
works fine.
If UF decides to switch to Can-
vas, it would take some time. Graff said in the past, transitions like this have taken about a year.

Gainesville Police arrested a local man 
Monday after he stole the business keys for a 
McDonald’s and tried to get away in his car, 
dragging the manager with him.
Officers arrested 23-year-old Gasuel Perez on hit-and-run charges, according to an arrest 
report.
At about 4:40 a.m., Perez started arguing 
with the manager over a poorly made cup of coffee, GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. Perez then stole the busi-ness keys from the manager. As Perez tried to flee in his car, the manager 
chased him and held onto part of the car door. 
Perez drove off anyway 
and dragged the manager a short distance through the parking lot, Tobias said. 
A husband and wife 
from Georgia were eating a 
meal in the parking lot of the restaurant, lo-cated at 6003 West Newberry Road, during the incident. The wife said she thought it was a lovers’ quarrel at first.
She noticed the manager yelling, “He got 
my keys! He got my keys!” she said. 
The manager suffered from several 
scrapes, scratches and bruises on her arm, leg and back. She later required medical care, To-bias said.
Officers booked Perez into the Alachua 
County Jail at 6:42 a.m. As of press time, his bond had not been set. Man steals McDonald’s keys, drags manager in parking lot

$5,000 short of UF’s roughly 
$21,000 average annual cost of attendance.
He said for the past 10 to 15 
years, revenues from athletics have been steadily increasing, but most of that money goes to facilities and coaches’ salaries. 
Along with the flow of 
money going toward support systems instead of students, he said the amount student athletes are being paid hasn’t 
changed in roughly 20 years. 
“The irony is that we can pay 
more for an academic scholar-
ship than we can for an athletic scholarship,” he said. 
While negotiations are still underway, Machen has been exploring several options with five of the six football confer-
ences to give more aid to stu-
dent athletes. Paying athletes stipends and increasing aca-demic support are both on the table.
Machen isn’t just looking 
to support football players. He wants to expand payment and support for all of the univer-sity’s athletes.
“There wouldn’t be just put-ting more money on the table,” he said. “It would be providing incentives, taking care of these 
athletes, making sure that they 
are able to get educated how-ever it needs to be done.”
Although the conferences 
have been pushing for more autonomy when compensat-ing student athletes, the NCAA 
took a stand against the federal 
decision. 
“While not a party to the 
proceeding, the NCAA is dis-appointed that the NLRB Re-gion 13 determined the North-western football team may vote to be considered university employees,” Donald Remy, the chief legal officer for the asso-
ciation, wrote in a statement. 
“We strongly disagree.”

More than 30 students wrote 
letters to fellow Gators on Monday 
evening during Words of Encour-agement, a program aimed to help students adjust to college life.
Saneh Ste. Claire, an 18-year-old 
UF telecommunication freshman, proposed the idea to Graham Area Council’s community service com-mittee and then partnered with U Matter, We Care and To Write Love On Her Arms.Ste. Claire was inspired after a 
UF freshman and classmate having a hard time died recently. Ste. Claire thought “if she had had just one person reach out to her, something could have been different.”
Hand-written, old-school letters 
from peers are more meaningful than online resources from strang-ers, she said.
The committee will submit the 
letters to the Dean of Students Of-ﬁ  ce, where they will be given to stu-dents who have reached out.
According to the Counseling &  Wellness Center’s annual report, about 45,000 student appointments were made in 2012-13. Of those, 2,660 presented anxiety problems, 1,938 were depressed, and 1,684 ex-pressed social isolation and loneli-ness.

� SOME SITES CHARGE TO 
TAKE PICTURES DOWN.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — The 
Florida Legislature is pushing 
through a bill that targets web-sites that charge people a fee to 
remove their police mug shots, 
a practice that some criticize as 
a legal form of extortion.
The bill targets companies 
that obtain booking photos 
from law enforcement agencies 
and then put them online, along with the person’s name and the 
charges they face. They then 
charge arrestees hundreds to thousands of dollars to remove 
them or face continued embar-
rassment. Some websites refuse 
to remove the photos even if 
the charges are later dropped or if the person is acquitted.
Under the proposed law, an 
individual could obtain a court 
order for removal. The website 
would be subject to a $1,000-a-day ﬁ  ne if it doesn’t comply 
within 14 days. Florida is trail-
ing several states in addressing the practice by such websites as mugshots.com.
“States across the U.S. are 
moving on this, so we’re hop-ing to catch up,” said Sen. Darren Soto, D-Kissimmee, the author of a measure that 
would require mug shot sites 
to remove booking photos at no charge. State and local govern-
ments would be exempt from 
the law.
Soto said he worked with 
the Florida Sheriffs Association 
in drafting the bill.
Mug shot companies, as 
well as media outlets, use Flor-ida’s strong open records laws to obtain content for their sites.
Some commercial sites have 
begun to include instructions on how to get a mug shot re-moved, charging by the arrest. 
At mugshots.com, one arrest 
costs $399 with the removal fee 
increasing to $1,799 for ﬁ  ve ar-
rests.
Removing booking photos 
for free would sap at least half of the operating revenue for mugshots.com, said Marc G. Epstein, a Florida lawyer who represents the company.
“We don’t solicit business, 
and we want to get to a point where all the revenue we get is from advertising rather than ads and removal,” Epstein said. 
“But removing for free at this 
point? When legislators work for free, then we’ll work for free.”
Wyoming, Georgia and Utah 
have all passed laws similar to the one proposed by Soto.State bill targets 
websites that don’t 
remove mug shots

Don’t be dumb,
don’t cross the line
April Fools’ Day is seriously tempting for college 
newspapers. So many raunchy jokes we could make! So many university ofﬁ  cials we could roast! So many 
punny headlines — more than usual!
And if there’s one thing we learned from looking through 
Alligator archives Monday night, it’s that our predecessors 
were pretty creative when it came to April Fools’ Day.  
In 1971, the Alligator editors designed a phony front page 
with a masthead reading “The Floreda Agitator,” referenc-
ing the paper’s old nickname. 
In 1986, we were “The Incandescent Florida Instigator.”
In 1991, a phony letter to the editor from “Prez Lambada, 
UF Grand High Poohbah” alerted readers that Student Gov-
ernment would be abolished: “We, the campus administra-
tors who decide the fate of your academic career with our 
every bureaucratic butt twitch, have some exciting news for 
you. … All your student activity fees will be returned so you 
yourself can make bad decisions about how to spend them. Also, campus parking decals have been abandoned. Park 
your car where you like — we just don’t care anymore.”
But perhaps the best came in 2005: “Donovan takes job 
with UF rival Kentucky” topped the front page, and at the 
bottom was a story about UF Transportation and Parking Services banning large cars from campus for taking up too much room. Among the affected was the Student Body president, who whined about having to park his limousine elsewhere.
April Fools’ Day is important because it shows readers 
that there are actual humans behind the news. We like to have fun, too. But the line between “hilarious” and “what-the-hell-were-they-thinking” is all too easy to cross. 
Like all pranks, April Fools’ Day editions can be funny 
if done right. In general, it seems that corporations have a better time on April Fools’ Day than newspapers. Just look at the 1996 stunt that Taco Bell pulled, when the company announced via seven full-page ads in the country’s leading newspapers that it had bought the Liberty Bell to alleviate the national debt. The new name for the privately owned American relic? The “Taco Liberty Bell.”
So why not go HAM with the jokes this year? The media is increasingly scrutinized and criticized for  
careless errors and biased coverage. In this age of informa-tion overload, we want our readers to feel conﬁ  dent that they can take our coverage at face value. 
We’re not trying to be a buzzkill — we just think solid 
journalism is responsible and therefore honest.
We never want to dupe our readers, even for the sake 
of comedy. That would only distract from our daily goal of publishing as much liberal, GDI trash as possible. 
Just kidding. ;)

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgMonday’s question: Have you had sex 
on UF’s campus?Today’s question: Should student athletes be paid?Chew on this: Paleo diet isn’t perfect
There’s a new fad in dieting commonly referred 
to as the “paleo diet.” The name is short for the “paleolithic diet” and is inspired by caveman — 
more accurately referred to as Neanderthal — diets. 
The diet stipulates the participant eat foods that the 
Neanderthals hunted and gathered. This includes the consumption of unprocessed meats and plants, ﬁ  sh, 
eggs, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds. Therefore, it 
discourages those on the diet from eating sugar, dairy, grains and processed foods. The diet claims to reduce the risk of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and chronic degenerative diseases while also increasing weight loss, 
athletic performance, loss of acne and libido. 
Basically, this diet claims to be everything you ever 
dreamed of and more. Doesn’t this seem too good to be 
true?
Of course eating unprocessed meats and making 
natural food choices will result in a healthier lifestyle. UF basketball star Patric Young went on the diet this past year, and have you seen his arms? They’re crazy. But Young is a collegiate athlete who consistently exer-
cises, and I’m assuming the guy could eat McDonald’s 
every day and still be a thousand times more athletic than most men.
Essentially, the diet seems like a pretty great choice. 
Some studies show a small amount of weight loss, nor-mal blood sugar levels and overall better health. 
It seems the only major health risk one takes while 
on the diet is missing out on some key nutrients by de-priving the body of dairy and grains. 
These nutrients, like calcium, are important to 
growth development in children. There is a reason our agricultural-turned-consumer-based culture is much taller than most of our ancestors. 
We get more hormones in our food now, some good 
and some bad, but for better or worse, these hormones help us grow taller and, subsequently, fatter.That being said, our hunter-
gatherer ancestors did not have a choice when it came to what 
they ate, meaning they had to 
work every day to ﬁ  nd any bit of food they could and wouldn’t pass up on a meal because it 
wasn’t healthy. I’m sure if the 
Neanderthals could exchange a ﬂ  int blade for a couple of 
cheeseburgers, they would have done so in a second. 
The Paleolithic era was not the time of domestication, 
therefore they could not access most of the genetically modiﬁ  ed foods we have today. This agricultural revolu-tion happened during the Neolithic Era, which started about 10,000 B.C. During that period of time, humans 
learned how to modify nature to their culinary desires. 
This fad diet, although not unhealthy and not too ri-
diculous in principle, has incited some people to take it 
up and gloat. 
It’s great if people want to try new things to improve 
their health, but more often than not, when I’m talking with someone who brings up the paleo diet, I get a sense of superiority. Being on a diet from 200,000 years ago is the ultimate hipster move. 
Takeaway message: Do whatever makes you happy, 
but don’t be condescending about it when you make your decision. 
Everyone has his or her own path to food enlighten-
ment. As long as you exercise and maintain a healthy 
diet, you shouldn’t run into too many nongenetic medi-
cal problems. Consult with your doctor if you think the paleo diet is something you would consider starting, and be sure to do your research ﬁ  rst.

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, APRIL 1, 2014  ALLIGATOR, 7
Even for a morning person like me, 7:30 a.m. isn’t the best 
time to hear a pal from high school rant about his family troubles. But I decided to continue the phone conversation 
and be a “good friend.” This was no light sacriﬁ  ce. Instead of en-joying the previous night’s episode of “The Daily Show,” I was 
listening to depressing personal problems. But sometimes you 
feel as though a friendship is worth sacriﬁ  cing a morning ritual, and this was one such rare occasion.  
I listened to my friend go through 
his half-dozen frustrations one by one. As he paused at the end of each, I would start advising him of a logical way of how he could easily resolve the particular family problem. For 45 min-
utes, the conversation followed this 
format: him telling me the problem and me responding with a sensible so-lution — until the very end. With no more grievances for me to help him with and the call coming to a close, I was taken aback to hear him end on an unappreciative note.
Before hanging up, my friend said he felt our entire conver-
sation was useless and he didn’t see the beneﬁ  t of my various 
advices. I hung up civilly, in case he had any more insult to add 
to my sacriﬁ  cing of 45 precious morning minutes.  
Years later, I realize he was right — I had indeed failed to be 
a “good friend” in that conversation. But how, you might ask? After all, didn’t I sacriﬁ  ce almost an hour and give him easy-to-follow, logical advice on how to solve his personal issues? 
First, let’s go back to what it means to be a friend. We have 
countless buddies who will readily join us in having a blast and countless others — colleagues, we call them — who’ll bond for 
professional reasons. But to call someone a friend means he or 
she is the rare person who bases his or her entire relationship on caring for you as you already are.   
To care is not easy. Every day, we get bruised by life’s punch-
es — academic, ﬁ  nancial, social, etc. — and a person’s reaction to your feeling bruised will reveal whether that person actually cares about you, whether that person is a friend. Friends won’t downplay your bruises or try to make you feel artiﬁ  cially happy for their own ease.
Take a look at some real friends from the case of Eeyore, the for-
lorn donkey from Winnie-the-Pooh: “One awesome thing about Eeyore is that even though he is basically clinically depressed, he still gets invited to participate in adventures and shenanigans with all of his friends. And they never expect him to pretend to feel happy, they just love him anyway, and they never leave him behind or ask him to change,” reads one description.
When folks tell us of their family problems, their tough days 
at school or how they felt hurt in some petty social interaction, 
it’s natural for us not want to hear of such downers. But since 
appearing coldhearted is taboo, we avoid having to deal with a troubled person’s distress through some common tactics: pile on some advice, prod the person with questions or try to minimize the problem. We use these superﬁ  cial, faux consolations — which allow us to stay within our comfort zones — because rarely do we actually care about that person and rarely are we friends. 
Caring for a friend in distress, however trivial the problems 
appear, means validating that friend’s deeper pain by listening 
and simply being there.  
“As the pain that can be told is but half a pain, so the pity that 
questions has little healing in its touch. What Lily craved was the 
darkness made by enfolding arms, the silence which is not soli-tude, but compassion holding its breath,” reads an Edith Whar-ton line on a protagonist’s need for empathy.
Let’s start being the type of friend that Henri Nouwen, the 
late Catholic scholar, spoke of: “When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often ﬁ  nd 
that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, 
have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. 
“The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair 
or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and be-reavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares.”

opinions@alligator.orgThe ﬁ  rst of many things wrong with 
the column in Time magazine by 
Caroline Kitchens is its title: “It’s 
Time to End ‘Rape Culture’ Hysteria.” 
Scare quotes are quotation marks that 
are used to cast doubt on a word or phrase, 
and they are being used here to question 
the existence of rape culture. However, rape culture is very real and should stand alone without quotations. Using “hysteria” to qualify the general reaction to rape culture trivializes this serious issue as another thing women have blown out of proportion with their overly dramatic and unpre-dictable emotions. 
Kitchens, the writer, is a research assistant at the con-
servative think tank American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research.
Kitchens’ argument in the Time column is that the 
actions of a small number of individuals, rather than American culture, are responsible for rape, and, “Twen-ty-ﬁ  rst century America does not have a rape culture.” 
Kitchens says that “rapists are despised,” so there 
must not be a cultural issue with rape in America. It’s easy to believe that just bad guys rape  — that rapists 
jump out from bushes at night with a knife or gun. That 
kind of rape is easy to label as “wrong.” 
But people start to divide on rape when the victim 
was wearing scant clothing, was promiscuous or was dating the alleged rapist. However, 73 percent of sexual assaults are committed by nonstrangers, and more than 50 percent take place within one mile of the victim’s home or even at the victim’s home, according to Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, the largest anti-sexu-
al assault organization in the U.S. 
Marital rape accounts for 25 percent of all rapes, ac-
cording to the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape. 
Though American culture may not outwardly promote rape, its exploitation of women passively tolerates rape culture.  
Kitchens questions activists who say, “Films, maga-
zines, fashion, books, music, humor, even Barbie … co-operate in conveying the message that women are there 
to be used, abused and exploited,” as if these are abso-
lutely ludicrous ideas.
But women are continually portrayed as objects, and 
as a former copy editor, I can tell you that objects are meant to be acted upon by the subject. This dehumaniz-ing attitude that is fostered toward women 
is rape culture. 
Our body parts are splayed on maga-
zine pages, commercials, billboards and TV 
shows, advertising everything from cars to perfumes to jeans to, “You’re not really sure what they are trying to sell, but you’re pretty sure it is not actually women.” 
Rape culture is school dress codes that 
tell girls their knees are too provocative and distracting to boys at school. Rape cul-
ture is jokes about sexual assault. Rape culture is women being taught to avoid rape and men not being taught to not rape. Rape culture is holding your pepper spray in one hand and your keys between your knuckles in the other as you walk back to your car at night. Rape culture is victim-blaming, cat-calling and slut-shaming. 
Rape culture is Fox journalists talking about the 
Steubenville rapists’ ruined bright futures when that is irrelevant to their crimes. Rape culture is asking the vic-tim what he or she was wearing or how much he or she was drinking. Rape culture is the demand for anti-rape underwear. It is the presence of gender stereotypes. The use of words like “dependent,” “emotional,” “passive,” “weak,” “ﬂ  irtatious” and “sexually submissive” to de-scribe femininity and words like “aggressive,” “strong” 
and “sexually aggressive” to describe masculinity. It is 
the popularity of songs like “Blurred Lines,” with lyrics like “I know you want it” and “I’ll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two.” 
No, America may not be explicitly accepting of rape, 
but it passively condones it. 
Rape culture is where we have to defend the existence 
of rape culture because the objectiﬁ  cation of women is so normal that it is practically invisible.
Rape-culture theory educates women to be empow-
ered about their bodies and men to have greater respect for women. And though rape accusations are very seri-ous and can have damaging effects on a person’s future, people falsely report being sexually assaulted only 3 per-cent of the time.  
Women are not hysterical about the issue of rape. We 
simply are aware that we live in a world that sexualizes and objectiﬁ  es us, and we realize that this kind of atmo-sphere cannot be removed from the rape conversation.

Protests in Taiwan have hit the two-week 
mark, and some Taiwanese students at UF 
are standing in solidarity with protesters overseas.
The public outcry, dubbed the Sunﬂ  ow-
er Movement by Taiwanese media, began March 18 when students demanded a review of a trade agreement with China, the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement, which they suspected was expedited through legisla-ture by the majority party, The Diplomat Magazine reported. 
The protesters fear the repercussions the 
trade agreement could have on Taiwan’s 
economy and are looking to pass a bill that 
would monitor trade negotiations, said Li-Li Chen, a 32-year-old fourth-year UF political science Ph.D student from Taipei, Taiwan.
“About 200 students occupied the Legis-
lative Yuan (national legislative building) to show their disagreement with the govern-ment, (which is) basically violently bypass-ing the law,” Chen said. “The government 
dispatched the police force and tried to 
force them out. It’s against the law of hu-man rights.”
On March 20, UF students who support 
the Sunﬂ  ower Movement released a three-point statement demanding respect for the democratic process in legislature, a govern-ment renegotiation with China and support for the protesters in Taiwan.
“This is a very complicated issue be-
cause it involves the economy and politics,” said Ping Huang, a 30-year-old UF fourth-year biology Ph.D student from Taichung, Taiwan.  “A lot of critics try to group (the protesters) as ‘You are anti-China. You are anti-economic development.’ But I don’t think that’s the point of value they are try-ing to promote.”
The movement has since multiplied, 
moving to the presidential building —  called the Executive Yuan — and ﬂ  ood-ing Ketagalan Boulevard, the 10-lane road in front of it, with a sea of sunﬂ  owers, the symbol of the movement.
“It’s small, but it has its democratic spirit 
for human rights and democracy,” Chen said. “That’s why we’re proud of Taiwan.”
As in Syria and Venezuela, Huang cred-
its social media to the spread of the protests. Students were the ﬁ  rst to form a group out-side the Legislative Yuan due to the ease of communication online. 
Other groups, including adults, began to 
gather as traditional media picked up the protests, she said. 
Huang said the movement is important 
for UF students who share similar beliefs about civil rights.
“When the government cannot repre-
sent their people, then like the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, you should stand up for that,” Huang said. “I know for general UF students, they might not even be able to identify where Taiwan is, but if they share these kind of beliefs, then learning what is 
going on is important for them and impor-
tant for us.”

Gabrielle Beecher gets dressed, goes to class and then sits 
down with strangers to listen to their stories.
Beecher, a 19-year-old UF journalism freshman, runs 
a Facebook page called Humans of UF, where she collects 
quotes and photos of people around campus.
She was inspired by the popular Facebook page Humans 
of New York, she said.
“I became so fascinated with how people were so willing 
to open up in such a short period of time,” she said.She said her goal for the page is to help the Gator Nation 
feel connected, she said.
“It’s uniting people through pictures and quotes, so 
they’ll get to see the things that brochures don’t show you,” 
she said.
Will Cuadra, a 22-year-old UF chemical engineering se-
nior, said the page shows diversity on campus. 
“I think it’s good ‘cause everyone you meet has their own story and is ﬁ  ghting their own battles,” he said.
Beecher talks to people who look bored or too interesting 
to pass up, she said.
Her trick to getting people to open up is skipping the 
small talk.
“I always use as my warm-up question, ‘What’s some-
thing about you that people would be surprised to know?’” 
she said.
Sigal Carmenate, a UF visual art studies sophomore, said 
she found the page after a friend posted about it on Face-book.

said. “It’s just a conversation away.”Humans of UF page aims to connect students via Facebook

UF journalism freshman� THE ICE POPS COST $3.50.

And so begins the cold compe-
tition for fruit-ﬂ  avored dessert op-
tions. In one corner, the hometown 
hero Mochi, and in the other, rising 
rookie The Hyppo.
The Hyppo Gourmet Ice Pops 
held its soft opening Friday evening 
next door to Mochi downtown.  
It boasts offbeat ﬂ  avors such 
as cilantro pineapple and mocha 
cheesecake.
The ice pops cost $3.50. A choc-
olate dip is an extra dollar. 
The Hyppo started serving all-
natural ice pops in St. Augustine in 
2010. The Gainesville location will 
hold an ofﬁ  cial grand opening in two to three weeks.
The creator and owner of The 
Hyppo, Stephen DiMare, said the fresh fruit it uses makes all the dif-ference.
“We want more stores like this 
to bring the diversity of the Pop-sicle and the idea of having this al-ternative treat especially for a lot of vegans and people that can’t have 
ice cream,” he said.
The store is in the process of removing dairy from 200 of its 450 
recipes to expand its market to the lactose intolerant.
Manager of the neighboring Mochi Chelsea Heidish said she doesn’t think the opening will af-fect business because the products are different. However, both claim to be 
healthier options than ice cream. Christianne Biggane, a 21-year-old UF neuroscience and nutrition ju-nior, said it seems like the two stores would attract the same crowd. She ﬁ  rst encountered the ice pops on a hot day at the Mumford and Sons stopover in St. Augustine.
“I could deﬁ  nitely see it (being 
successful),” she said. “The demo-graphic is here for sure, especially because they are vegan and rela-
tively healthy.”  
Previously a vegan herself, Big-
gane said the store will probably 
become a go-to for her.
Kristine Myny, a 24-year-old UF 
applied physiology and kinesiol-ogy graduate, said a new frozen treat store opening right next to Mochi seems like a bold move.
“The other place will grab cus-
tomers, but Mochi is already low-calorie,” she said, “and it already has a following.”
However, she said anything 
new and innovative like this usu-ally attracts college students.
Greg Kusel, 19-year-old UF 
environmental engineering fresh-
man, said he thinks the pops will 
reach the same market in a differ-ent way.    
When he thinks of ice pops,  
he thinks “of being outside in the 
sun, not really a dessert place like 
Mochi,” he said.TUESDAY, APRIL 1, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Billy Donovan has seen his team accomplish a lot 
this season.
The top-seeded Gators have won 30 straight 
games, became the first team to finish 18-0 in regular-
season Southeastern Conference play and clinched 
their first Final Four berth since 2007 Saturday after 
defeating No. 11 seed Dayton 62-52 in Memphis, Tenn.
But now that the celebration and excitement of 
getting over the Elite Eight hump has calmed, Dono-van is preparing his team for the next obstacle — one that supersedes the court.
While the team has been playing with a win-or-
go-home mentality for the past three weekends, Donovan needs his team to be ready for the external obligations that are bound to arise.
“What I try to do this time, right now this early 
part of the week is these guys have got to get their personal stuff out of the way,” he said. “I think when you go to a Final Four, there is a lot of stuff coming at them. I can’t even imagine the amount of people that want tickets from them and people want this or that. There are a lot of things. I need to give them time to handle their personal stuff.”

A week off gave Florida gymnasts 
exactly what they need to regroup af-
ter an unexpected second-place finish 
at the 2014 Southeastern Conference 
Championship.
“It’s been wonderful, it was defi-
nitely needed. We were able to give 
them kind of a down time after coming 
back from SECs so kind of a few days break from doing full routines,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “When you’ve been doing them for three and a half 
months straight, it get’s a little tiring.” 
To give them a mental and physical 
break, Faehn had her gymnasts prac-
tice skill work instead of repeating full 
routines at the start of last week. 
“They were charged up again when 
we went really hard on Friday and Saturday, and back with full routines 
again,” Faehn said. “Those were the best practices we’ve had the entire 
year.” 
She added that the focus and deter-
mination also came through in Flori-
da’s full Friday and Saturday practices. 
The team now has two practices left in 
Gainesville before traveling to Penn State on Thursday for Regionals. 
As for the health of the team, Faehn 
said she’s happy about it. 
“I think that they’re feeling as good 
as they’re going to feel right now,” Faehn said. 
“I think they’ve been managing it 
very well and we’ve been really try-ing to still give them the opportunity to rest if they need to and I think that was important for our very fragile ath-letes.”

March didn’t treat only the Florida men’s 
basketball program well.
Florida baseball, powered by a resur-
gent pitching staff, has won 13 of its past 16 
games to vault itself into the national rank-ings for the first time in a month. No. 13 Florida (19-9, 6-3 Southeastern Conference) 
hosts Florida Atlantic (15-12, 4-8 Conference 
USA) tonight at 7 at McKethan Stadium.
For the first two weeks of 2014, the Gators 
opened with as many wins, six, as losses. 
There was no rhyme or reason separating 
one game from the next. Then, coach Kevin O’Sullivan settled on a starting rotation and bullpen pattern that has reaped dividends.
“We really would not be where we are 
without them,” Taylor Gushue said of Flor-ida’s pitching staff.
O’Sullivan inserted freshman Logan 
Shore into the weekend rotation before Florida faced Connecticut, naming the freshman the Friday-night starter. The cere-
bral right-hander from Coon Rapids, Minn., 
immediately energized the Gators.
Former pitcher and stu-
dent assistant Keenan Kish welcomed Shore to colle-
giate baseball with a towel 
full of shaving cream to the face following Shore’s 6.1 inning win against Ar-
kansas on March 14 that 
drew comparisons to for-
mer Gators right-hander 
Hudson Randall.
He tossed 8.2 innings in a 6-2 victory 
against then-No. 8 LSU on Saturday. 
Eric Hanhold outdueled Tigers ace Aar-
on Nola in a walk-off Game 1 win just hours before Shore helped clinched the series in a 
rare doubleheader.

  Florida has shown how dif-
ﬁ  cult being undefeated truly is. 
The Gators have ﬁ  nished un-
defeated in American Lacrosse 
Conference play only once — in 2012.
  For No. 4 Florida, being unde-
feated in the ALC means every team it faces until the end of the conference tournament will give the Gators its best effort.   But with players like junior Shannon Gil-
roy and sophomore Sam Darcan-
gelo, Florida becomes Goliath to every other team’s David.
  Saturday, Florida (12-2, 3-0 
ALC) will travel to No. 9 Johns Hopkins (10-1, 1-1 ALC) to face yet another ALC competitor.
  Johns Hopkins most recent 
game against unranked Vander-
bilt gave the team its ﬁ  rst loss 
in 10 games. The squad was un-defeated before battling it out in Nashville, Tenn.
  Florida is currently ﬁ  rst in 
ALC standings, but with three 
more ALC opponents, the Gators 
must play perfectly in their ﬁ  nal games of the regular season if they want to stay undefeated in the conference. 
  Darcangelo is part of Florida’s 
formula for winning. 
  Darcangelo didn’t get much time on the ﬁ  eld in her freshman 
year. Tallying only four points 
for the season and winning only 17 draw controls, Darcangelo’s freshman year looks dismal com-
pared to her sophomore season.
  This season, the Freeland, Md., 
native has started in all 14 games 
and has 27 points. 
She has been instrumental on 
the draw with 36 controls — the second highest on the team be-hind Gilroy — and has won 22 ground balls.
  The 2014 season has been Dar-
cangelo’s year, and she gets bet-ter with each game.
  Going into the game against 
the Blue Jays, coach Amanda 
O’Leary is working to prepare 
her players for in-game changes and adapting to the opposing teams. 
However, as O’Leary always 
says, it’s about winning the draw and getting on offense, and Dar-cangelo has been more than help-ful to this Florida team in doing 
that.
  “Draw controls, ground balls, 
goals, she across the board played a phenomenal game [Sunday],” 
O’Leary said. 
“We’ve seen that with Sam, 
day-in and day-out and it was one of those days where every-thing looked good for her. Her presence on the draw circle was 
just key. 
“She did what she needed to 
do.”  Darcangelo has become like 
her teammates Gilroy and Nora 
Barry. 
People know her name, and 
that’s because she has become a critical piece to the puzzle that is 
the Florida lacrosse team.  O’Leary is aware of how criti-
cal Darcangelo is and knows 
what a threat the midﬁ  elder pos-es to teams on the other end of the draw circle.
  “I mean, I’m glad she’s on our 
team,” O’Leary said.

Sam Darcangelo prepares to shoot during Florida’s 18-7 win against High Point on Feb. 15 at Don-
ald R. Dizney Stadium. Darcangelo has scored 27 points in 14 games this season.
Darcangelo has 22 goals this seasonweekend. You just work, work, work. You 
don’t put your head down,” O’Sullivan said of Shore after the SEC opener. “You 
don’t complain. You don’t make excuses. 
You just continue to work hard. He got his first start against UCF on Feb. 18 and next thing you know he’s pitching Friday 
nights.”
Florida started the season with a rota-
tion of Bobby Poyner, Brett Morales and 
Karsten Whitson. Poyner, the opening-day starter, is now a bullpen mainstay. 
Whitson (1-0, 5.65) will make his first 
appearance in two weeks and his first start in almost a month on Tuesday night, and Morales hasn’t seen consistent innings 
since beginning his college career as the 
No. 2 starter.
Eleven of these past 16 games have come 
at home. Florida dropped its only series during the streak against Texas A&M when 
it lost Games 2 and 3 by one run each.
Florida’s weekend starters have aver-
aged 4.35 innings per games, with Shore 
leading the team at 6.58. Its bullpen has 
depended on arms like Poyner, Aaron 
Rhodes and Danny Young for long-relief appearances.
Poyner made an appearance in six 
straight games in a week between the UConn and Arkansas series. Sometimes, he faced a single batter, like he did on March 12, while other times he threw multiple in-nings. 
He started the series finale in College 
Station, Texas, and worked 4.2 innings.
Rhodes has pitched two-plus innings 
in five of his last eight appearances. Con-
versely, the Gators’ hitting improved from 
.251 before facing Southern Mississippi on March 4 in Pensacola to .262 heading into Tuesday night. 
Help has even come from unlikely 
sources. 
Left-handed freshman Kirby Snead, 
an Alachua native whose fastball doesn’t break 90 mph, had never pitched more than 
an inning before Sunday’s game against 
LSU but tossed 4.2 innings of scoreless re-lief in  UF’s 11-7 win.
O’Sullivan continues to say — rightly so 
— that the hitting is coming around, but there’s no denying what has carried Flori-da from a fringe-.500 club to one that sets up nicely in a pitching-dominated confer-ence.
“When you pitch as well as we have 
and play good defense, you just need some timely hits,” O’Sullivan said Saturday. “I talk to the other coaches in this league and 
everybody is talking about how good the 
pitching is in this league, and the margin for error is very small.”
With each player receiv-
ing only six tickets for family, 
sophomore Michael Frazier II said his family has been un-derstanding of the situation 
he is in.
“They know that I’m a very 
focused person,” Frazier said. 
“So, they know when it comes to things like this not to really bother me. I’ll handle it and I do a pretty good job of han-dling it well before the game starts so I don’t have to worry 
about it.”
Donovan said it’s tough 
to teach his team what they 
will be experiencing when they head to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, but the 18th-year coach is working on getting them in the right mindset.
“I’ve got to try to help 
them understand what they’re 
walking into,” Donovan said. 
“In doing that, they’ve got to really, really pay attention to just them doing their job of moving to the next thing and not getting distracted by all this event brings to it.”
Because none of the play-
ers have experience with the 
outside pressures that encom-
pass the Final Four, they will be looking to Donovan for support.
“He knows what goes into trying to win this thing,” Fra-zier said. 
“He knows what’s going to 
happen, from the distractions all the way up until game time. He knows. He’s been 
through it. So I think the big-
gest thing for us is taking his advice on things and listening to him.”
Added senior Scottie Wil-
bekin: “I hope it helps. But what he was describing of the Final Four was just a lot of distractions, and we’re go-
ing to try our best to not get 
distracted by all of the hoopla and the excitement of the Fi-nal Four.”
For Frazier, the Gators just 
need to continue what they have been doing all season long.
“I think everybody has re-
ally bought into what he’s put on the table,” the sophomore shooting guard said. 
“It’s just staying locked 
into the process every single day and not worrying about the future, not worrying about the past. Just staying locked into the moment. And we’ve all bought into that, and that’s 
why you hear it a lot from us. 
“We all believe it’s going to 
work, and it’s been working. I 
think we’re going to continue to do that. It just shows that when you have a team that’s bought in, it can really take you far.” Donovan 2-1 all-time 
in Final Four games with the Gators up All-American honors for their 
regular-season performances. Bridget Sloan was the only gym-
nast in the nation to earn All-
America first-team honors on each of the five events. 
Junior Kytra Hunter and senior 
Alaina Johnson also earned spots on the All-American all-around first team. 
Hunter is also on first team for 
vault and floor. 
Senior Mackenzie Caquatto 
earned a spot on the first-team un-even bars and balance beam for the second year in a row. 
“It just shows that they are con-
sistently competing at a very high level and doing great gymnastics week in and week out,” Faehn said, “which I think speaks volumes for 
just how disciplined they are.” 
When Florida hits the floor in 
University Park, Penn., on Sat-
urday at the Northeast Regional 
Championship, it will be exactly 
two weeks since the Gators last performed. 
But Faehn maintains her team 
is focused on the future and the fi-
nal two titles on the line versus the 
SEC title the Gators failed to claim for the first time in two years. 
“It’s going to be just the start of 
the most incredible set of events going on through the rest of the season that our whole team has been looking forward to this whole year,” she said. 
“We had a great competition 
there, but it was not our absolute best. But I told our team that it was most important how we respond 
to that.”TUESDAY, APRIL 1, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

  Through his ﬁ  rst eight seasons at Florida, softball coach Tim 
Walton has worked with some top-notch pitchers. 
  It started with Stacey Nelson, a three-time All-American 
who now holds UF career records for wins (136), strikeouts 
(1116), lowest ERA (0.99) and shutouts (60). Nelson’s 136 career 
wins from 2006-2009 tie for the sixth-most victories in NCAA 
history as of the start of the 2014 season.
  Then came Stephanie Brombacher, who averaged 7.05 
strikeouts per game while walking only 1.78 batters per con-test during her stint with Florida from 2008-11. The Pembroke Pines native went 42-0 through her ﬁ  rst two years with the Gators and posted a career winning percentage of .898 — good enough for the fourth-best in NCAA softball history.
  During Brombacher’s senior year, Hannah Rogers arrived, 
and Lauren Haeger joined UF’s pitching staff one year later. Through the 2013 season, Rogers, now a senior, and Haeger, now a junior, teamed up for a 128-30 record in the circle, ac-cruing a combined 1.76 ERA and striking out 914 batters in the 
process.
  But when Delanie Gourley joined the team in the 2014 sea-
son, the freshman provided the Gators a tool that they haven’t 
had since Walton became head coach — a lefty.

    Gourley has tasted success before.  As a pitcher at Lakeside El Capitan (Calif.) High School, 
she struck out 1,352 batters — the 10th-highest total in Califor-nia high school history. Gourley also led her travel team, the Southern California Athletics, to three straight Premier Girls 
Fastpitch National Championships from 2011-2013.
  Since arriving at Florida, Gourley has not skipped a beat.
  On the season, the 5-foot-4 freshman leads UF’s pitching 
staff with 98 strikeouts and is averaging a team-best 1.14 strike-outs per inning — the second-highest mark among freshmen in the Southeastern Conference and the sixth-best tally among all freshmen this season. She holds a 2.45 ERA through 19 game appearances and has pitched seven complete games, three of which were shutouts.
  After Gourley’s ﬁ  rst collegiate appearance — a one-inning 
save in Florida’s 3-2 win against Illinois State on Feb. 7 — Wal-ton wasted no time pitching his new weapon against stout competition.
  The freshman made her ﬁ  rst collegiate start against then-
No. 5 Michigan on Feb. 8. Despite facing the task of pitching against Florida’s toughest opponent at that point in the season, Gourley wasn’t fazed.
  “I really wasn’t that nervous because I think I just transfer 
that into excitement and adrenaline,” she said. “And I just re-ally wanted to get started and kind of show what I had.”
  Gourley got off to a fast start, striking out three Wolverines 
in the ﬁ  rst two frames and giving up only one hit.
  But then came the third inning. With the bases loaded, 
Michigan shortstop Sierra Romero hit a grand slam to give Michigan an early 4-0 lead. 
  “I knew exactly, right when I threw the pitch, I thought, ‘Oh 
no. This is going really far,’” Gourley said. “But it’s bound to 
happen. That was just unfortunately right there and ended up 
a grand slam.”
  But Gourley remained calm in the circle after surrendering 
the home run, holding the Wolverines scoreless in the ensuing ﬁ  ve innings and giving up only three additional hits as Florida earned a 9-4 victory in extra innings.    In her 12 starts following the Michigan game — which in-
cluded a 15-2 win against then-No. 22 Minnesota — Gourley has only given up 26 earned runs while fanning 91 batters in 76.2 innings.
  “She’s faced some good at-bats. She’s faced some good hit-
ters,” Walton said. “I think it’s going to give her a lot of experi-ence. The main thing we’ve got to be able to shape her into is the conﬁ  dence. She’s got to be able to have the conﬁ  dence to go out there and throw her pitches — any location, any pitch, any spot, any situation.”
  Veteran pitchers Rogers and Haeger think Gourley is doing 
all the right things in the circle in her ﬁ  rst campaign.
  “I thought she’s done excellent,” Rogers said. “It’s tough 
coming in here and being a young pitcher.”
  Haeger feels that Gourley’s presence brings a new dynamic 
to the team, and with UF now having a third pitcher in the starting rotation, it will only work in Florida’s favor.
  “Delanie is so much different from me and Hannah,” the 
Peoria, Ariz., native said. “We all bring something super dif-ferent to the table, which as a hitter in my mind, that’s really hard to adjust to. … Delanie has a great change-up. She throws 
hard. She’s a lefty and that’s already coming at you in a differ-
ent way. All the pitches are going in a different direction, so I think everyone, all three of us, go together well because we are so different.”
   
  Working alongside Rogers and Haeger keeps Gourley fo-
cused.
  “They keep me driven every day,” she said. “And every 
day it gets that much better.”
  The two upperclassmen have helped Gourley adapt to col-
legiate softball, even though her ability to remain collected in the circle during tough situations has been visible from the start of the season.
  “She’s doing so great and just no matter what happens, 
she has a smile on her face and that’s just kind of how she is,” Haeger said. “She’s just going with the ﬂ  ow. She doesn’t really 
think about who the opponents are or anything, and I think 
that’s a really good thing that she has.”
  Walton hopes that composure will remain with Gourley 
throughout her time at Florida.
  “Delanie deﬁ  nitely adds a totally different perspective on 
the game of softball,” Walton said. “Left-handed pitchers are really hard to come by, especially good ones, and she’s one of the best we’ve ever had to recruit, let alone coach.”  Left it be: Gourley giving UF unprecedented weapon in circle
