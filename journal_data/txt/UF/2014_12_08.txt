Silently, about 200 people collapsed on 
top of one another on the middle of Tur-
lington Plaza. They lay lifelessly for four 
and a half minutes.  Cardboard signs read “AmeriKKKa we 
can’t breathe,” “Justice for who?” and “I 
am your citizen, too, America.” Shirts read 
“black lives matter.”
Students and community members 
marched onto the plaza with red-taped 
mouths at 12:35 p.m. Friday to stage a die-
in following the non-indictment of the po-
lice ofﬁ  cer who killed Eric Garner.The group, dressed mostly in black, 
formed a circle, and two people shouting, 
“we can’t breathe” cued the collapse. They lay silently on the ground, symbolizing 
the four and a half hours Michael Brown’s body lay lifeless, said Dream Defender 
member Trenton Brooks.

site,” the 22-year-old Santa Fe College an-
thropology sophomore said. “This is life.

The UF Board of Trustees approved 12 new faculty 
hires in hopes of pushing UF toward becoming a top 
10 public university.
Seven of the new hires specialize in areas where 
UF preeminence is building on, including health, ag-riculture, computing and education, according to a UF press release.
Student Body President Cory Yeffet said the addi-
tion of new faculty members is an important part of 
the preeminence plan and is a new trend the university 
has adopted to bring in the best faculty from around the country.
“They are top faculty, and hopefully they’ll bring 
with them the ability to bring new grants and gain high recognition here,” he said.
According to the release, the new faculty were 
granted tenure after the board approved recommen-dation with their appointments.
The board also passed a resolution Friday naming 
Bernie Machen president emeritus.
Machen, who will be stepping down at the end of 
the semester, will remain in Gainesville with his wife, Chris.
Janine Sikes, a UF spokeswoman, said the title does 
not come with any duties but that he could serve in an advisory role in the future.
“It’s an honorary title,” she said. “I think they’re 
still discussing his role going forward.”
Yeffet said the title is well deserved.“I think he undoubtedly deserves it after everything 
he’s done in the last decade,” he said.Board of Trustees

One UF student died and another is 
left in critical condition after a motor-
cycle accident Friday night.
Shortly after 7 p.m., Thomas Jose-
phy Coady and his passenger Haile 
Lynn Guelﬁ  , both 22, ran a red light 
at the intersection of 34th Street and Northwest Eighth Avenue on a motor-cycle. The pair hit the passenger side of 62-year-old Tolar Powell’s pick-up truck, said Gainesville Police spokes-man Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
Coady and Guelﬁ   were both sent to 
UF Health Shands Emergency Room with serious head wounds and other internal injuries. Powell was left unin-jured.
Coady was pronounced dead at 
12:53 a.m. Saturday, Tobias said.
Guelﬁ   is still in the hospital and in 
critical condition, said UF spokeswom-an Janine Sikes.
Sikes said Coady was a biology 
senior at UF. Guelﬁ   is also a biology senior.The day after Coady died, Maria 
Coady Bedard — his mother and an education professor at UF — changed her Facebook proﬁ  le picture to one of her and Thomas.
“Its a beautiful picture maria,” one 
woman commented. “I’m so sorry for your loss. Tom was so sweet and funny.”
“Maria, my heartfelt condolence 
and prayers in this tragic time of grief,” another man commented. “Thomas’ home is in heaven where you will meet again. … Amen.” One dead, one critical after crash

FORCING SUSTAINBILITY EFFORTS 
FOR THE NEW YEAR.

A UF student government organization 
will host a consumerism and sustainability 
summit Wednesday.
Gators Going Green will be joined by 
the UF Office of Sustainability and Films for Action will take part in the event at 7 p.m., featuring a guest speaker and short 
documentary viewing at the Levin College 
of Law, Room HOL285C.
A discussion will follow the documen-
tary on consumerism and sustainability.
The group is aiming to bring environ-
mental awareness to every student.
Gators Going Green is implementing 
new events to encourage UF students to understand and engage in sustainability 
efforts. 
This is the second summit the organiza-tion is hosting this semester.
Dylan Sutton, a UF environmental engi-
neering senior and chief of staff for Gators 
Going Green, said he hopes the summit will get more students interested and involved 
in the green initiative.
“We are hoping this will be a big suc-
cess,” the 21-year-old said.
Gators Going Green is also reaching out 
to the local Gainesville community to at-
tend the summit.
“We are trying to get local organizations 
to come out and support us and talk about their own initiatives and views on the en-vironment,” said director of programming Naida Bhagudas, a 19-year-old UF econom-ics and sustainability junior.UF group to host green summit

In a 4-3 reversal decision early Friday, 
the Gainesville City Commission voted 
to return a one-mile sector of Northwest Eighth Avenue to a four-lane road.
The segment of the street, which runs 
from Northwest 23rd Street to Northwest 34th Street, was originally four lanes.
In August 2013, the commission ap-
proved a plan to reconstruct the road with two vehicle lanes and added bi-cycle lanes for a trial period. And then 
in December 2013, it voted to keep the 
two-lane configuration until construc-tion started in 2015.
But during Friday’s vote, the four-
lane option prevailed once again.
It was a point of contention for resi-
dents who weighed in with concerns for both options. The new four-lane road will incorporate a 10-foot-wide sidewalk, with a line down the middle demarking the walkway and the bike lane.
Commissioners Lauren Poe, Helen 
Warren and Randy Wells disagreed with the decision, citing safety issues and risks to pedestrians without a median. But Mayor Ed Braddy asked staff to adjust the option to accommodate other factors, such as a median to make crossing safer.
“There’s time to figure out what’s 
best,” Braddy told the commission.
The Gainesville Area Chamber of 
Commerce backed the $3.6-million plan, which will be funded through taxpayers’ money, for a four-lane road.
Alyssa Brown, a spokesperson for the 
chamber, said the change would support growth in the Gainesville area.
“We feel that reducing automobile 
capacity hinders growth,” Brown said. “We are for a four-lane option because it meets the needs for the Gainesville area today but sets the stage for growth and opportunity tomorrow.”
The move to increase roadway trans-
portation works toward the chamber’s goal of making Gainesville a global hub of talent, innovation and opportunity, she said. Brown said the chamber sup-
ports the $3.6 million project because 
it will ultimately facilitate economic growth in Gainesville through more con-venient transportation options.
Tracey Higdon, president of the 
Gainesville Professional Firefighters Union, said the wider road would give first responders more accessibility and give drivers space to pull over when ap-
proached by an emergency vehicle.
Higdon said the previous two-lane 
model made it more difficult to reach 
residents but that the addition of two lanes will help response vehicles get closer to achieving their goal of a four-minute response time.
Still, the major concern for pedestri-
ans and bicyclists remains — their re-
duced accessibility to the road.
Thomas Hawkins, a local attorney 
and former city commissioner, said the 
new decision is “outrageous.”
Hawkins said that between the years 
2003 and 2012, about 500 people died in car accidents in the city, and about 100 of those were not in cars when killed. 
“We have as many as 6 percent of 
commuters traveling by bike,” Hawk-ins said. “For folks that bike and walk, I think it’s not fair. We are just ignoring this problem.”
He added that the option to ride on 
the sidewalk may not be best for all bi-cyclists. As a bicyclist himself, Hawkins said he doesn’t ride on the sidewalk be-cause of the added danger posed by cars 
backing out of driveways.
“They should ride where they feel 
most safe and where it facilitates trans-portation,” he said.
The commission has not finalized its 
plans and has deferred ideas for an im-
proved model to project engineers.
But with a large population of bicy-
clists in the city, Hawkins said he thinks issues like the Eighth Avenue sector will continue to be important to residents.
“Frankly, I think this has to be a more 
important political issue in our commu-nity,” he said.Commissioners vote to 
expand NW Eighth Ave
“We are trying to get local 
organizations to come out and 
support us and talk about their 
own initiatives and views on the 
environment.”

� A NEW COMMITTEE 
WAS FORMED. 
BEATRICE DUPUY
Alligator Staff Writer
bdupuy@alligator.org
The Levin College of Law 
dean search is back after Presi-
dent Emeritus Bernie Machen called off the search last Spring.
Machen appointed members 
to the committee, including co-chairs Diane McFarlin, dean of the College of Journalism and Communications, and Robert Rhee, a UF law professor.
The new dean search will 
cost $100,000 with search firm Isaacson, Miller. Last Spring, UF spent $90,000 for the failed 
search consisting of 24 candi-
dates. UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes wrote in an email that the firm specializes in law dean searches. The University of Vir-ginia used it last year.
When Machen decided not 
to select one of three finalists during the first search, contro-
versy arose amongst college 
faculty, staff and students over the issue of diversity. The se-lected finalists included black University of Kentucky College of Law Dean David Brennen 
and openly gay former U.S. 
Ambassador David Huebner.
In an email from Spring, 
Machen wrote that he, along with the provost, “did not find one (candidate) ideally suited to lead the College.”
After the failed search, UF 
law professor George Dawson 
stepped in as interim dean to 
replace Dean Bob Jerry, who retired.
Dawson wrote in an email that the committee will take student input into close consid-eration.
“Celeste Thacker — a third 
year student — is a member of the search committee so there is direct student input to the committee in addition to any other methods the search com-mittee may decide to employ,” he said.
Faculty and students are 
optimistic for the new search, which president-elect Kent Fuchs will oversee.
Jeffrey Harrison, a UF law 
professor, said he’s anticipating a dean with a proven leader-ship record.
“I’m personally looking for 
an experienced administrator 
from another school who has 
had success and who has a strong record of scholarship,” he said. “Somebody who really understands the challenges fac-ing legal education.”
Separate from the search 
committee, the law faculty formed an advisory committee.
UF law professor Pedro A. 
Malavet sits on the committee. He said the group advises the president and will have some say on the hopes for the law school.
“It opens up communication 
about law school concerns,” he said.
The search committee is 
set to meet within the com-ing week. McFarlin, one of the 
co-chairs, said she believes the 
committee members will pro-vide unique perspectives to fa-cilitate a successful search.
“Our law school deserves 
an exceptional dean,” McFarlin said.New law dean search 
will cost UF $100K
About 200 people lay lifelessly for four and a half minutes
At least 15 organizations were present, 
including the UF Dream Defenders, UF 
Institute of Black Culture, Students for a 
Democratic Society and the Women’s Stu-dent Association.
They met the night before at the Civic 
Media Center to hash out the impromptu event, Brooks said. On Friday, they lay in solidarity with others around the nation who have been angered by the deaths of unarmed black males.
“We were born to do this,” he said. “I 
really feel like I didn’t really do anything new. All I did is speak for those who didn’t have the opportunity to do so. This campus is going to start to shift. It’s going 
to change. We’re a unit. We’re a commu-
nity. And we’re going to build that. And that’s what I tried to do.”
Diamond Delancy, a UF public rela-
tions and women’s studies junior, said she found out about the die-in Thursday.
“The community has really gotten to-gether,” the 19-year-old said. “What one 
person knows, we all know. And I think 
that’s important: to come together and fight together.”
Unity brought the organizations to-
gether.
“It shows that if you’re killing one of 
us, you’re killing all of us,” Brooks said. “We all can’t go down. There’s not just one body in the street. We have to come 
together so there’s no more bodies in the 
street.”
Delancy said she thinks the die-in 
made a difference. Awareness is just the 
beginning, and action follows right after.
“We can’t breathe anymore. We can’t 
stand for this injustice anymore. We’re 
not going to just sit down and die any-more,” she said. “We’re going to fight for 
our lives. I think it’s important that the 
world start to wake up to injustices, and this is the first step — to put it out on dis-play in front of campus and say, ‘Wake up.’ You need to fight for your right to 
breathe.”die-in , from page 1LocAL

Following a federal court decision announced 
Wednesday, Florida same-sex couples can marry 
by early January — but some partners are hesitant 
to plan their ceremonies.
Though the decision was seen as a victory in the 
LGBT community, no same-sex couples have re-served a spot to tie the knot at United Church of Gainesville, said senior minister Shelly Wilson. She 
said the church is accepting ceremony reservations for anytime after Jan. 5.
“We plan to be there on the courtyard stairs and 
plan to offer our services,” Wilson said.
Same-sex couples have not reserved ceremonies 
at the Baughman Center or the Alachua County Courthouse either, but both locations said they are accepting reservations for dates after Jan. 5 as well.
Gaby Larios, external vice president of the UF Pride Student Union, said most couples are appre-
hensive about making wedding plans because rul-
ings have been delayed in the past.
The 19-year-old women’s studies sophomore 
said she hopes the ruling is passed, but issues like bullying, suicide and transgender health care are still prevalent matters in the LGBT community.
“A lot of people are not as excited about this rul-
ing as they should be because it’s gonna make it seem like it’ll be the end of the LGBT movement,” she said.LGBT couples concerned about ruling

Tivoli Silas spent an entire week 
in the Reitz Union basement this 
semester.
During that time, the 20-year-
old UF English junior became well 
acquainted with the instructors, 
painters and clay pot makers who frequented the Arts and Crafts Center.
Similar to the students whirl-
ing around their potters’ wheels, Silas was also making art. Unlike those with red clay on their hands, she was handling a Canon XH-A1 
camera.
Silas and a classmate have cre-
ated a five-minute documentary on 
the center, which will be screened free for the public Thursday at The Wooly at 7 p.m.
“I’m really excited to be able to 
see it at a public screening,” Silas said. “It will feel very profession-al.”
Her film “Hidden in the Base-
ment” will be shown with six other mini-documentaries.
All of the films were filmed and 
edited by students at UF over a period of five weeks. They are in Lauren DeFilippo’s English class dedicated to film and media.
“They go through all the steps 
an independent filmmaker would go through,” DeFilippo said. “That includes writing the treatment and pitching their ideas, all the way to editing and this final screening.”
She said traditionally, at the 
end of the semester, the films have always been played at the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art. This year, DeFilippo wanted to change ven-ues.
“The Harn has always been 
good and supportive,” she said. “But this year, I chose The Wooly 
to help integrate the event into the larger UF and Gainesville commu-nities. It seems more conducive to 
what we’re trying to do.”
Though a Gainesville native 
and graduate of UF, this is DeFil-ippo’s first semester teaching.
As a professor, she has enjoyed 
seeing her students’ films trans-form and develop conceptually.
“The films are all very unique 
and interesting,” she said. “It’s been a great opportunity for them to learn from each others successes and failures.”
Although Silas has been a pa-
tron of the Reitz’s Arts and Crafts 
Center before, during filming she 
was surprised to find many non-students and professionals using the facility.
She said she feels strongly about 
making time for activities like arts and crafts and hopes to demon-strate this to viewers.
“Especially as college students, 
we’re always busy with exams and work,” Silas said. “Through my film, I want people to be reminded of the importance of leisure.” Student documentaries to be shown
It’s at the Wooly on Friday“A lot of people are not as excited about

An adult Christmas rap, a retirement 
home spelling bee and the worst family 
Christmas photo ever taken will all take 
place on Friday night at the Hippodrome 
State Theatre.
These scenes will be brought to life by 
Just Kidding, Gainesville’s newest student-
run sketch comedy group. Their debut 
show is at 8:30 p.m. Friday at the Hippo-drome.
“Just Kidding is hopefully an hour and 
a half of your life that you just get to not 
take yourself seriously, not take anything 
too seriously and just have a good time,” said Lauren Killer, a 20-year-old UF theatre 
junior and founding member of Just Kid-
ding. “It’s about laughing at yourself and other people.”
Just Kidding was founded in the Spring 
by a group of friends in UF’s School of The-atre and Dance. It evolved over the sum-mer, and now, the group’s vision is becom-ing a reality.
“We’re just a group of friends getting 
together who are passionate about it,” said Chaz May, a UF musical theatre sopho-more and founding member.
This was May’s first time writing com-
edy sketches.
“I’ve acted in a lot of things, but writing, 
seeing the words you write on stage and said by people who are Equity performers is really, really cool to see,” the 19-year-old 
said.  Viewers can expect a lot of fun and a lot 
of laughter from this show, said Just Kid-
ding cast member and UF musical theater freshman Bradley Cloversettle.
“It’s been a lot of fun because we can 
veer off from the script, and it’s more about fun instead of a structured script process,” said Cloversettle, 18. “We just have fun with it and let our imaginations run free.”
Cloversettle said the opening number of 
the sketch is probably his favorite.
“I don’t want to give anything away, 
but it’s about a crazy director who wants 
everything to be perfect, and he’s directing 
a community theater, and he wants every-thing to be a little more professional than it actually is,” he said.
Just Kidding isn’t only a live show. It 
will also be streamed online through the group’s YouTube channel. Those who can’t make it to the live show can watch it on justkiddingcomedy.com.
Tickets are free and available on the Just 
Kidding website.
“We hope that people come, and they 
just keep an open mind and are just pre-
pared to laugh at themselves and the 
show,” May said. “It’s not trying to make a point. It’s just fun.”New student sketch comedy
� THE NEW LOCATION IS ABOUT 
FOUR TIMES BIGGER.

Thousands of items lined The Repur-
pose Project’s shelves Saturday as custom-
ers celebrated the new location.
Now operating just two doors east of 
Satchel’s Pizza at 1920 NE 23rd Ave., The 
Repurpose Project is a nonprofit thrift store 
that specializes in reusing, reducing and recycling the donations most second-hand stores turn away.
“Right now, our society throws away 
a lot and buys more than we need,” co-founder Sarah Goff said. “Why not use what we already have in our backyards be-fore going and taking more resources and 
energy and water from the planet?”
The new shop has everything and the 
kitchen sink — about 15 sinks, actually.
Its property is a jumbled-up labyrinth. 
Stacks of salvaged wood and piles of win-
dowpanes sit alongside towering walls of fabric and forgotten objects.  
“Anything from buttons to bathtubs is 
what you’ll find here,” said Lauren Corley, a 20-year-old sustainability and the built environment sophomore who works as an 
intern at The Repurpose Project.
The new location is about four times 
bigger than the organization’s old build-ing, allowing The Repurpose Project even 
more opportunities to expand. They plan to open up a gallery space and host com-munity events, Goff said.
“We’ve been able to watch the store 
grow from nothing to this, so it’s been real-ly awesome to be so involved,” said Kelsey Luksovsky, a 20-year-old public relations junior and Repurpose Project intern.  
With a fiddle playing Christmas 
songs and Satchel’s selling slices of pizza, Gainesville residents browsed the store, stopping to talk to friends and strangers.   
“I was really excited about their new 
place,” said Haley Wright, a 20-year-old UF health science sophomore.
“I just really wanted a study break,” 
said her friend Hope Fischer, a UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology sophomore.
Places like The Repurpose Project make 
Gainesville more interesting, Fischer said.
“There’s a bunch of little things that you 
can find to do that are out of the ordinary,” 
the 19-year-old said.
“Gives it character,” added Wright.  In a corner, a propped-up coatrack was 
missing a leg. A single pineapple-shaped cake tin and a lone alligator drawer pull 
were found among eight-track players and 
office supplies.
“We try to do the little bits and pieces 
that end up getting thrown away — things that have value,” Goff said. “I knew Gainesville would be the kind of place that would support something like this.” Repurpose Project opens

and they just keep an open mind

Gainesville Police welcomed a new horse to their Mounted 
Patrol Unit Friday.
Bolt, a 7-year-old saddle horse and thoroughbred cross-
breed, will be replacing Blue, who retired earlier this year. The 
department has three other horses: Zeus, Rusty and Merlin.
On Friday afternoon, GPD brought Bolt and Zeus to the 
front of The Oaks Mall. Parents and their kids stopped, smiled 
and took pictures. Bolt stood strong and calm in his stuffed 
reindeer antlers.
“He has a seemingly unending curiosity,” said Tracy Fun-
denburg, Gainesville Police Corporal.
Bolt’s owners, Christy and David Larson of Alachua, origi-
nally tried to sell him. But when the police department ap-proached the couple about allowing the horse to join the force instead, they decided to donate him to GPD.
“Instantly, we were intrigued,” Christy said. “They put 
him through the testing and he did fantastic, so that’s where we knew he needed to be. It is more important for Bolt to have a good job and a good home than it is for us to have a couple extra dollars in our pocket.”
Bolt joined the department in May and has been working 
on his 200 hours of required training ever since. Because the Larsons used to participate in mounted shooting competi-tions, Bolt is used to being around gunfire, a GPD press re-lease said.
Bolt spent three years living with the Larsons.“He was a huge part of our family,” Christy said. “We 
miss him, but he’s like your kid who grows up and goes off to college. It was the best thing for him.”
Bolt gets his name from the thick, white strip on the left 
side of his muscular, coffee-colored body.
When he was younger, Bolt’s full name was Lightning 
Bolt, Christy said. But one day, while Bolt was hanging out by a tree in a pasture with six other horses, lightening struck. All 
six horses died except Bolt.
“Lightning Bolt was too close to home,” Christy said. “So now we just call him Bolt.”
Christy’s husband, David, said Bolt was his favorite 
horse.
“He was my buddy,” he said. “He was always my favor-
ite.”When it came to opting to donate Bolt instead of selling 
him, David said it was a no-brainer.
“The horse is what I care about,” he said. “The money I 
don’t care about. When he was with us, he was just eating hay 
and getting fat.”

The power of international solidarity
It’s been more than two months since students went 
missing in the Guerrero state town of Iguala, Mexico. The young men had confrontations with the police while 
protesting unfair employment practices for teachers who discriminated against rural applicants and favored urban ones. The police killed three students and three bystanders in their altercation with the protesters. The allegation is that 
the police then captured 43 of the young men and handed 
them over to Los Guerreros Unidos, a drug gang, for execu-tion. 
This past weekend, the remains of Alexander Mora were 
identiﬁ  ed among char. This terrifying discovery corrobo-rates the accusation that once passed to Los Guerreros Uni-dos, the young men were killed, their bodies were burned 
and their ashes were scattered in a river.
This news comes at the same time as announcements that 
the police ofﬁ  cers who killed unarmed Michael Brown and 
unarmed Eric Garner would not be indicted and made to stand trial for their murders.
Only a small portion of my social media network has ad-
dressed the ongoing situation happening in Mexico. And this topic has not once made its way into my conversations with friends at UF. This lack of outcry does not imply a lack of caring because I know a lot of people who care tremen-
dously about the corruption of the Mexican government and 
justice for the lost protesters. What it does suggest, though, is that we should work toward showing we care.
The history of colonization and imperialism has greatly 
affected the power dynamics of all things related to the po-lice-related killings in the U.S. and protests that result from those killings make global headlines, while smaller fonts are reserved for stories about Mexicans marching with signs that read “Justice” and “Peña Out.”  This makes their strug-
gle for justice nearly invisible.
When we talk about injustice, U.S. current events com-
mandeer the dialogue and other current events are often-
times never brought up. The 43 lost in Mexico can seem like just a Mexican problem, whereas the systematic racial kill-ing of people of color in the U.S. is painted as a problem  the entire world should pay attention to. 
Take note of how many protests 
happened abroad following the shooting of Brown and my point is made: London, Palestine and 
Tibet, just to name a few, are plac-
es where protests were staged.
The truth is that the lost 43 are 
not just a Mexican problem. The story is part of a larger is-sue the world is seeing right now that involves police bru-tality, corruption and discrimination. When placed in that perspective, I hope it becomes apparent why we should all 
be invested in this story and others like it.
As U.S. citizens and residents, we should be actively 
keeping an eye on other justice and civil rights movements 
that happen outside of our own borders. We cannot fall si-lent on others’ struggles for justice because their stories do 
not ﬂ  ood our headlines and news feeds. We are capable of 
being interested in multiple things. I can care about the treat-ment of people of color in the U.S. and also care about what President Peña Nieto of Mexico is doing to bring closure and justice to the families of the lost 43.
The golden rule reads, “Do unto others as you would 
have them do unto you.” In the months following the kill-ing of Brown — which sparked innumerable protests and a heated dialogue about how the police interact with black 
and brown bodies of the U.S. — I have felt great support 
from international strangers who have chosen to stand in solidarity with those of us publicly decrying police brutality and institutionalized racism.
I want to express the same sentiment and stand in soli-
darity with all world citizens also ﬁ  ghting for justice, equal-ity and their rights.

Democrats are generally known for favoring education 
spending by the federal government, whereas Republi-cans tend to oppose such expenditures. Many prominent 
Republicans, including Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) and former Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas), have expressed support for 
eliminating the U.S. Department of Education altogether.
However, a new proposal from Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) 
proves that Democrats can be just as wrongheaded on education 
policy as many Republicans are.
One of the most important federal education programs is the 
Pell Grant system. The Pell program provides millions of young, low-income Americans with money for college tuition. Accord-ing to the White House, nearly 9 million students will utilize a Pell Grant during the 2015 ﬁ  scal year.
The Pell program is currently running a surplus, which will 
turn into a deﬁ  cit in 2017. Harkin’s proposal would take the Pell surplus and use it to increase payments to private student loan servicers like Navient Corp. and Nelnet Inc. The loan servicers act as middlemen for the federal government, collecting pay-ments from federal student loans in exchange for hefty fees. In ﬁ  scal year 2013, the federal government spent nearly $680 mil-lion on payments to loan servicers.
These companies, Navient in particular, have come under 
ﬁ  re for their questionable business practices. According to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, “The U.S. Department of Justice accused Navi-ent of deliberately cheating as many as 60,000 active-duty troops out of as much as $60 million.”
The Pell program has already seen massive cuts in recent 
years. In 2011, Pell Grant spending was at $42 billion, and this year, that ﬁ  gure is at about $29 billion.
President Barack Obama has also expressed support for in-
creasing payments to student loan servicers. A proposal from 
the White House would raise total payments to loan servicers 
by the federal government to $772 million. These proposals by Harkin and Obama are textbook examples of corporate welfare. Lawmakers slash programs that actually beneﬁ  t ordinary Amer-icans in order to bolster the proﬁ  ts of large corporations.
Student loan debt in the U.S. is absolutely out of control. Ac-
cording to the Education Department, total student loan debt now stands at $1.1 trillion dollars, about twice what it was in 2008. An ideal solution to this problem would be to increase ﬁ  -
nancial aid in an attempt to bring down debt. Instead, the presi-
dent, Harkin and other politicians seek to lavish federal dollars on the companies whose underhanded business practices are a main reason student debt is such a serious issue.
America’s students, Gators included, deserve better from 
their government than an education policy that puts loan ser-vicers ﬁ  rst and students last. Democrats are in dire need of in-creased youth voter turnout to bolster their chances of political success. With policies like the ones advocated by Harkin and 
Obama, it is difﬁ  cult to see why any young voter would support 
the blue team.MONDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2014

Krishna Lunch program, UF Foundation 
working on pedestrian-friendly plaza
In his Friday’s letter to the editor, Kyle 
Gorman expressed concerns about the lo-
cation of Krishna Lunch on the Plaza of the 
Americas. Our current location offers sitting places and convenience for students, as well as accessibility for setting up and serving the 
lunch.Nevertheless, Gorman does point out 
ways the collective use of the space could 
be improved. To that end, The UF Founda-
tion is planning a major update to the plaza. 
Not only will the renovated area be greener (thanks to the critical storm water collection 
system it currently lacks), but it will feature 
safer, more welcoming pedestrian paths, 
new special event areas for student activi-ties, and courtyards flanking the main plaza 
will unite it with the historic core of campus. 
The renovated plaza will also feature a long 
row of iron picnic tables along the west mar-
gin of the plaza.
The Krishna Lunch program has teamed 
up with the UF Foundation to raise the funds needed for the remodeling from alumni and 
other friends of the plaza. You may find more information at: uff.ufl.edu/Initiatives/
PlazaOfTheAmericas/KrishnaLunch.asp. or 
krishnalunch.com/plaza/.
Thank you for your patience as we work 
to successfully complete the plaza renova-tion.

During the last few weeks, America has been in an 
uproar over the cases of Michael Brown, Tamir 
Rice and now Eric Garner. Many columnists, 
myself included, commented on these developments 
as they happened, sometimes with too much haste and 
without considering their impact. I think it’s important 
to take a moment to point out when the truth was bent 
and sometimes completely ignored.
Last week, my colleague TehQuin Forbes wrote, “The 
hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has garnered great popular-
ity recently with members of the black community and 
their allies, who are using it to speak out against the 
systematic killing of black people in the U.S.” While I 
understand his good intentions in explaining what the 
hashtag meant, he unfortunately portrayed an atrocity that is simply not happening in America. To say that there is a “systematic killing of black people in the U.S.” 
is a grand exaggeration that takes hyperbole to the next 
level and incites fury that is erroneous. I agree there is a problem with our justice system, and blacks often face 
harsher punishments for the same crimes whites com-
mit, but to proclaim that blacks are being systematically 
killed goes too far and depicts police and other enforc-
ers of the law in a negative and unfair light.
If you believe blacks are being systematically killed 
in America, I challenge you to look at what is happen-
ing around the world. In Syria, from March 2011 to Au-
gust 2013, the Syrian government killed approximately 11,000 detainees in the most gruesome ways imagin-
able. The Guardian originally reported on this “indus-
trial scale” killing and found that “most of the victims were young men and many corpses were emaciated, 
bloodstained and bore signs of torture. Some had no 
eyes; others showed signs of strangulation or electrocu-
tion.” The amount of killing and the fashion in which it 
is executed is truly barbaric, and what happened over there is what real systematic killing is like. To compare 
crimes against humanity like that to our current pre-
dicament is wrong and somewhat irresponsible.
My other colleague Alec Carver also wrote about the 
events unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri, and somehow 
managed to justify the actions of the rioters over the un-
satisfactory indictment decision against Darren Wilson. Carver wrote, “the fact that some have taken advantage 
of the unrest to loot stores and damage property has been used to delegitimize the 
protests. These incidents have 
distracted from the real issues 
and resulted in a false portray-al of the people of Ferguson as 
violent and unwilling to respect the rule of law.” As I mentioned last week, I understand the community’s 
outrage over not indicting the officer responsible for 
Brown’s death, but to burn your own city to the ground is not the right way to go about garnering change and getting people on your side.
For Carver to continue to call these “protests” and si-
multaneously mention that the protesters looted stores 
and damaged property is a bit concerning. Once you 
start committing crimes and ransacking your own com-munity, you have gone from peaceful protesting to de-structive rioting, which is never OK. To try and spin 
this destruction into something good is misguided. To 
report on these incidents is not creating a false portrayal of the people of Ferguson as violent and unwilling to 
respect the rule of law. It’s actually quite true, as the 
rioting and looting did, in fact, happen — and those in-
volved openly displayed a disrespect for the law.
The overall response from these situations from 
American citizens has been mostly reasonable and con-
structive. For example, I agree and support the protests 
currently happening in New York over the death of 
Garner. I think most people would agree, especially if you watched the gut-wrenching video, that the officer 
responsible for Garner’s death should have been indict-
ed, as it was made clear that Garner was being choked to death. The protests over his death have been mostly 
peaceful without any violence and theft. When protest-
ers do decide to turn their campaigns violent, they dele-
gitimize themselves and lose the support of the general 
population, as evidenced by what happened in Fergu-son.
From here on out, I encourage everyone who is upset 
over these events to step back and then formulate an appropriate response that doesn’t involve exaggeration and willful acceptance over obvious missteps. Taking 
the time to do this will result in more constructive argu-
ments and better opportunities for real change.

Climate Change. Global Warming. Sustainability. 
Environmentalism. These divisive partisan is-sues form the foundation of a constant debate 
between conservative and liberal forces. Congressmen and congresswomen on both sides of the aisle carefully 
select language that resonates with key demographics. 
While the millennial generation hasn’t been a huge fac-tor in politics in the past, many of these voters make up a large portion of the up-and-coming “rising elec-torate,” the given name to a voting demographic that is comprised of millennials (voters age 18-30), unmarried women and certain minorities (Latin Americans and blacks). The U.S. census shows this group will encom-pass nearly half of the voting population in the coming elections. As political capital and influence shifts to-ward the rising electorate, there are important questions 
about its implications for key environmental issues.
Recently, the Yale Project 
on Climate Change Commu-
nication polled the likelihood of certain demographic groups to vote for a political candidate who “strongly supports taking 
action to reduce Global Warm-
ing.” The study found, in April 2014, that the rising electorate polled 51 percent more likely and 12 percent less likely. The rest of the voting population responded with a more negative perspective, showing 39 percent more likely to 21 percent less likely. To many, this statis-tic is hardly surprising. However, in February, the Pew Research Center studied a different question with the same rising demographics. They found that 32 percent of millennials, compared to 42 percent of Generation X, identify with the term “environmentalist.”
In the 2012 election, according to a study by the 
Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), Ohio, Florida, Pennsylva-nia and Virginia depended on the youth vote. Eighty electoral votes hung in the balance, a difference roughly equivalent to the difference between the percentage of millennials who call themselves environmentalists and the percentage of the rest of the population that does.
Beyond the surface, this data explains the importance 
of cohesive language and narrative in social movements, 
heralding the demise of “green” initiatives whose pub-
lic campaigns are stories that preach a 1962 Silent Spring environmentalism to a 21st century generation.
The efforts of environmental movements throughout 
the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries have had a remarkable impact on causes we absolutely can-not afford to forget. However, the language and nar-rative of these organizations struggles to appeal to the rising electorate. Ultimately, sustainability must reclaim 
its story. It must rewrite that story for a generation that 
is passionately concerned about numerous issues and dedicated to creating a better world not just environ-mentally but economically and socially as well.

Katheryn King spent Saturday 
dressed up as a 19th-century home-
maker.
Donning a black full-length dress 
with long sleeves and a yellow cloth 
belt, King was one of about 40 vol-
unteers at Dudley Farm Historic State Park’s 25th annual Cane Day.
Cane Day is an educational cel-
ebration of the past, and the event included demonstrations of prac-tices like sugar-cane syrup making, corn grinding, butter churning, met-alworking and children’s games.
“We’re living in such a technol-
ogy-driven era,” King said. “No one wants to go outside and play anymore. So it’s good to have these hands-on activities that kids can have fun doing while learning to ap-preciate what they have.”
Dudley Farm brought in more 
vendors and musicians this year, 
said Morgan Tyrone, park manager. 
They also utilized more of the farm’s land for the celebration.
“Most people don’t realize the 
farm goes so far back,” he said. “By spreading out the event, people have a chance to enjoy more of the farm.”
Cane Day, which is focused on 
the post-Civil War era of reconstruc-
tion through mechanization, is the 
park’s biggest and longest-running event. It brought in about 3,000 visi-tors this year — about 20 percent of its annual visitors.
Dorothy James, a 69-year-old 
volunteer, demonstrated knitting during Cane Day.
“It’s wonderful to teach the chil-
dren,” she said. “A lot of children don’t see people making things these days, and showing the process of making clothes shows that what-ever you do takes time.”
James said events like Cane Day 
show the hard work that went into the simplicity of the old farm life.
“Everyone says, ‘Oh, I wish I 
could go back and live on an old farm,’” she said. “It’s more work than people think.”
Gainesville residents Beth and 
Eric Newman brought their 3-year-old granddaughter, Danielle, to the farm to see the animals and experi-ence the early South.
“She’s very curious,” Beth said. 
“It’s good for her to see history at a young age.”
Mysteri Barnhill, a 52-year-old 
Silver River State Park ranger, made and sold period clothing, fruit-based jams and soaps at Cane Day. 
“Kids don’t understand what 
their grandparents went through,” 
she said. “It creates a bond between 
family roots and opens dialogue about the old times. Otherwise, they might never think about it.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2014

Gainesville Police arrested a 
man after officers said he robbed 
a man at gunpoint following an attempted marijuana drug deal at Archer Court Apartments 
Thursday evening.
The victim, Alonzo 
Snowden, asked 19-year-old 
Uriah Anthony Scott if he could buy some marijuana at about 7:30 p.m., according to a police report. Snowden told Scott he did not have money but would pay him at a later time.
Snowden walked to Scott’s 
apartment — located at 3001 SW Archer Road — and knocked on the door. Snowden told police he opened the un-locked door because he could hear someone inside the apart-ment and thought it was Scott.
Once inside, Snowden said 
Scott then came from around the corner holding a black revolver and robbed him, ac-cording to the report. Scott took Snowden’s wallet, a silver neck-lace, a knife, a cell phone and a pair of steel-toe work shoes.
When police arrived at 
Scott’s residence, they found all of Snowden’s belongings, along with the gun Scott used to rob him. Officers also found two scales and a few plastic bags with cannabis residue.
Scott was arrested on charg-
es of armed robbery and pos-session of drug paraphernalia. His bond has not been set.

A Gainesville man was ar-

Shortly before 2 a.m., Navar 
Avontrelle Robinson, 25, met up with Takeira Marie Presley at the Winn-Dixie on Southwest 20th Avenue. The two have a child together and Presley was handing over their 1-year-old to Robinson. He asked her if she was seeing other people, 
according to a police report. 
Presley said yes.
Angry, Robinson then went 
to the trunk of his car and pulled out a black handgun, which police later found out was a BB gun. He pointed it at Presley’s head before Presley drove away. With the child in 
the back seat of his car, Robin-
son sped off and chased Pres-ley. 
He was arrested on charges 
of aggravated assault and child abuse without great harm. He is currently being held on a $50,000 bond.Police roundup: drugs,

WASHINGTON — President 
Barack Obama said Saturday he 
authorized the attempt to rescue 
American Luke Somers in Yemen 
because the U.S. had information that the photojournalist’s life was in imminent danger.
Yemen’s national security 
chief said militants planned to kill Somers on Saturday. On Thursday, al-Qaida in the Arabi-an Peninsula posted a video on-line threatening to kill Somers 
within 72 hours.
Authorities 
said Somers, 
who was kid-
napped in Sep-
tember 2013, 
and a South Af-
rican teacher, Pierre Korkie, died in the rescue operation Obama 
said was conducted by U.S. forc-
es in partnership with Yemen’s government.
The president said he “strong-
ly condemns the barbaric murder of Luke Somers at the hands of al-Qaida terrorists” and reaffirmed that the U.S. “will spare no effort to use all its military, intelligence 
and diplomatic capabilities to 
bring Americans home safely, wherever they are located.”
A U.S. raid last month tried to 
rescue Somers but he was not at 
the site, the Pentagon’s spokes-
man acknowledged Thursday.
Obama said “other informa-
tion also indicated that Luke’s 
life was in imminent danger.”
“Based on this assessment, 
and as soon as there was reliable 
intelligence and an operational 
plan, I authorized a rescue at-
tempt yesterday,” Obama said in the White House statement.Obama: Somers’ life was in danger

its story of a young woman who said she was gang-raped at a frater-nity party at the University of Vir-
ginia, saying it has since learned of 
“discrepancies” in her account.
“Our trust in her was misplaced,” 
the magazine’s editor, Will Dana, wrote in a signed apology.
The backpedaling dispirited ad-
vocates for rape victims who said they are concerned it could lead to a setback in efforts to combat sexual 
assaults both at U.Va. and college 
campuses elsewhere.
The lengthy article published 
last month focused on a woman it identified only as “Jackie,” using her case as an example of what it called a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at U.Va.
Rolling Stone said that because 
Jackie’s story was sensitive, the magazine honored her request not 
to contact the men who she claimed 
participated in the attack.
The statement Rolling Stone post-
ed on its website said discrepancies in the woman’s account became ap-parent “in the face of new informa-tion,” but provided no details about what facts might be in question.
That wasn’t enough for some.
“It is deeply troubling that Roll-
ing Stone magazine is now pub-
licly walking away from its central storyline in its bombshell report on the University of Virginia without correcting what errors its editors be-lieve were made,” Attorney General Mark Herring said in a statement.
The original story noted that a 
dangerous mix of alcohol, date-rape drugs and forced sex at fraternity parties is by no means unique to any one U.S. university. In fact, U.Va. is one of 90 schools facing Title IX sex-ual-violence investigations from the Education Department.
The story prompted protests, 
classroom debates, formal investiga-tions and a suspension of fraternity activities.
Some advocates for sexual as-
sault victims expressed concern that Rolling Stone’s backpedaling could discourage victims from coming for-ward.Rolling Stone casts doubt on U.Va.

Two UF geologists are 
working with NASA and the 
U.S. Geological Survey to study the effects of climate change on the dunes at Cape Canaveral, where NASA houses its launch equipment.
Peter Adams and John 
Jaeger, assistant and associ-ate professors of the UF Geo-logical Sciences department respectively, started their re-search on the Cape Canaveral shoreline in 2009.
Adams said he became in-
terested in Cape Canaveral 
and its conspicuous “bump” 
along an otherwise straight and sandy coast when he be-came a professor at UF.
Climate change is affect-
ing the dunes on the beaches of Cape Canaveral, a poten-tial threat to NASA. There are launch pads and other launch infrastructure just a couple hundred yards away from the shoreline that could be harmed by dune erosion, Ad-ams wrote in an email.
He and Jaeger began their 
research with the help of a graduate student who trav-eled to the Kennedy Space Center every four years to collect data on the changing shape of the beach.
“Now, our data set is five 
years long and we think it will be one of the most informative data sets on shoreline change that has been collected,” Ad-ams said.
Rising sea levels affect coastal locations like Florida and cause the shoreline to 
erode or move landward.
Adams said if the dunes at 
Cape Canaveral were washed 
away by these storms, it could critically damage NASA’s 
launch pad and infrastruc-
ture.
NASA has built artificial 
dunes to protect its founda-tion. But it is difficult to fore-
see how long these dunes will 
offer protection because storm 
size and frequency are not eas-
ily predicted, Adams said.
Climate change and rising 
sea levels are still an issue at the Kennedy Space Center, 
but these artificial dunes were 
built to stabilize the issue.
Adams said he would 
suggest people become more aware that we live on a planet 
with a very active surface that 
is constantly changing.
“We need to pay close at-
tention to our environment through research, education, 
and by promoting public 
awareness so that individu-
als can make sound decisions 
for how society interacts with our physical environment,” 
he said.
Camila Gonzalez, a UF bio-
chemistry freshman, said it’s exciting that professors from 
UF can research such an im-
portant topic.
“People need to be more 
educated about this problem,” the 18-year-old said. “It’s real-
ly cool for UF and the profes-
sors to be able to do this kind 
of research.”UF geologists to study

When Bob Barnas, 66, of High Springs, 
served in Vietnam, a member of his company 
stepped on a land mine and was killed in-stantly.
A team of UF researchers is now work-
ing on improving the probability of detect-ing land mines and decreasing the number of false alarms during detection.
“Having equipment that can find land 
mines in places is an important thing as Viet-nam moves forward and they start farming again,” Barnas sa.
Joseph Wilson, an assistant professor in UF’s Department of Computer and Informa-tion Science and Engineering and researcher, said land mines are both a military and hu-manitarian problem.
There are more than 9 million land mines 
in Egypt alone, Wilson said. Most were bur-ied in WWII for the tank wars, but they’ll still blow up.  
“There are land mines and buried explo-
sive devices all over the world,” Wilson said.
The Army Research Office granted the 
researchers $1 million in September. Wilson said this money will go toward paying the researchers for their efforts. They are now in the process of receiving data for analysis.  
The researchers will create algorithms and evaluate existing systems using data on com-puters in UF’s Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering to find the best way to detect land mines.
“If you make a mistake … then somebody 
loses his or her life,” said associate profes-sor in UF’s Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering and re-searcher Arunava Banerjee.
Wilson said companies make ground-pen-
etrating radars and sensing devices, but they often falsely detect underground explosives.
The goal of UF’s research is to evaluate the 
existing ground-penetrating radars and sens-ing devices.
Banerjee said the problem is difficult be-cause devices need to be able to work over all 
different terrains.
After this project concludes, the govern-
ment could fund contractors to build work-
ing systems using the information from the research.
Wilson said the team was asked to apply 
for the grant. He said UF has been working with systems to identify land mines and ex-plosive hazards since about 2000.
“It’s really a hard problem,” he said. “It’s 
one of those problems that keeps on giving. Because it’s so hard to solve, you can make incremental progress for a long time.”
Paul Gader, a professor and the depart-
ment’s chair, and Damon Woodard, who is coming from Clemson University to join UF in January, will join Banerjee and Wilson in their research.

College Football Playoff

Jim McElwain has the experi-
ence.
After coaching on the offensive 
side of the ball for 29 years with 
eight different teams, he knows the 
ropes.
From pro-style offense to spread, 
he’s covered his bases.
And on Saturday, during his first 
press conference as Florida’s new-
est head football coach, McElwain — sporting a black jacket, orange tie and Gator pin — was quick to tell the more than 100 members of the media inside the Norm Carlson Press Box at Ben Hill Griffin Stadi-um that he will use his pedigree to 
do whatever is needed to win.
“I’m that dog they dropped off 
down at the humane society and he 
has about a little bit of every breed in it,” McElwain said. “Whatever the situation is, you try to bring that breed out that helps success.”
McElwain has the responsibility 
of freeing a Florida offense that has 
been in the doghouse for the past 
four years. In the Will Muschamp era, the Gators never ranked better than 94th in total offense or 67th in yards per play.
McElwain has the confidence he 
will be successful with whatever tal-ent he has on hand.
“I believe I can win with my 
dog Claire-a-bell,” McElwain said. 
“That’s the attitude.”
And while McElwain has seen 
his share of offensive success in his 
time — most recently his three years as the head coach at Colorado State and his four years as Alabama’s of-fensive coordinator before that — there’s only one statistic that matters to him: the wins.
“At the end of the day, whether 
you have two yards on offense or 900 yards on offense, win the game, McElwain ready to fix Florida’s offense

Florida freshman Devin 
Robinson said the Gators 
lost to the Kansas Jayhawks 
because they were afraid of 
losing.
“We weren’t trying to go 
out there and win,” Robinson said. “We were just afraid, 
like we just got to hold on to 
the game and not lose and that’s what went wrong.”
Ultimately, Florida’s fear 
won and the newly unranked Gators (3-4) squandered a 15-point halftime lead and fell to No. 11 Kansas 71-65 on 
Friday at Allen Fieldhouse.
The Gators shot 53.6 per-
cent and held the Jayhawks 
to 34.8 percent in the first half. 
But Florida’s field goal 
percentage dropped to 34.5 percent in the second half.
When the second half 
came around, Florida man-aged just nine rebounds 
while Kansas secured 24.
“I think the way we played 
in the first half with the ball 
movement, the spacing, get-
ting to the points, we had 
some baskets at the rim on good penetrations and dump downs,” Donovan said. “I thought we were pretty well 
balanced, we shot a high per-
centage, so these guys are ca-pable and have shown signs of doing that. The biggest 
thing is being able to sustain 
that for 40 minutes.”
Robinson, who started 
on Friday, scored a career-high 13 points and made two 
three-pointers.
Tonight, the Gators will 
have the opportunity to re-
deem themselves from the 
worst record they’ve had 
since 1998 when the team plays Yale (8-2) at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.
“They’re a great team,” 
Robinson said of Yale. “They don’t have any individu-als that’s going to try to go for themselves, they are go-
ing to play together, play 
strong. So, I mean we’re go-ing against a great team so we gotta play hard.”
Florida has had little time 
to recover from the Kansas loss. The team arrived back in Gainesville from Law-rence, Kansas, around 4 a.m. 
Saturday morning. 
With one practice that 
same day at 5:30 p.m., Don-
ovan broke down film and UF prepares to take

STAFF REPORT
After missing out on a bowl game last season for the 
first time since 1990, the Gators football team is going 
bowling once again.
Florida (6-5) will play in the Birmingham Bowl against 
East Carolina (8-4) on Jan. 3 in Birmingham, Alabama. Kickoff is set for noon Eastern Time (11 a.m. Central Time).
Defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin, in his fifth year with the Gators and second as defensive coordinator, will serve as the interim head coach for the game.
“We’re very excited to be heading to the Birmingham 
Bowl,” Durkin said in a release. “Our guys are ready to get back on the field to begin preparation to face a very good ECU team.”
This will be just the second meeting between Florida 
and East Carolina, with the only other matchup coming 
on Oct. 22, 1983, when the Gators defeated the Pirates 24-
17.
In addition to the bowl game, Florida will also host 
East Carolina on Sept. 12 in the second game of the 2015 season.
The last time Florida played an opponent in a bowl 
game as well as in the ensuing season was Florida State, when the Gators defeated the Seminoles in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 2, 1997, and then defeated them 32-29 on 
Nov. 22, 1997.Florida set to play in Birmingham Bowl against East Carolina

Florida volleyball finished 
out the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament with 
a three-set win against Alabama State on Friday and a four-set vic-tory against Miami on Saturday. The Gators head to Ames, Iowa, to face No. 9 seed Illinois on Friday in the Sweet 16 round of the tour-nament. Florida heads into Iowa with a 22-game win streak for the first time since 2010. It’s also the first time since 2010 that the Gators have made it to the Round of 16. If Florida advances against Illinois, it will look to potentially face No. 1 seed Stanford.

ways get a kick out of all these people that love their statistics. Let’s look at the win and loss. That’s the overall thing for a 
program and organization to 
be successful.”
UF athletics director Jeremy 
Foley said McElwain epito-mized the criteria laid out when he announced the head coach search three weeks ago: He has a track record for offensive suc-cess and is a high-integrity and 
high-character individual.
“He’ll do the right thing 
every day,” Foley said. That’s 
who he is as a person.”
After meeting with McEl-
wain in his house just outside of Fort Collins, Colorado, on Tuesday, Foley knew McEl-wain was the answer.
“Besides the X’s and O’s and 
the integrity and all those other things, you’ve got to want this job. ... It was very evident for me, especially after I talked to Mac on Sunday after we played FSU, he really, really wanted to be here,” Foley said. “And then you add all the criteria we talked about, it put him to the top very, very quickly.”
McElwain knew this was an 
opportunity he couldn’t afford to pass up, even if it meant he had to spend $2 million of his own money to get a deal done.
“To be able to have that op-
portunity is something I’m not 
sure I could have lived with, 
given that opportunity and let-ting it pass by. I’m not one to ever let things pass by,” McEl-wain said. “I kind of roll up my sleeves and go get it done and that’s what it’s really all about.”
And while Foley needed to 
make sure McElwain was the right person to lead his football team, McElwain said the path went both ways.
“As he did the research 
on me, I did the research on him now, OK. I didn’t fall off the turnip truck yesterday, all right,” McElwain said. “Every 
person I talked to spoke of in-
tegrity, quality, great person to be with.”
The pressure will be high for 
McElwain, but that’s not stop-ping him.
“If there’s no pressure,” 
he said, “why wake up in the morning?”He couldn’t pass up 
chance to work at UF made corrections not even 24 
hours removed from the game.
“What happened behind them 
and what they did is, doesn’t re-ally mean anything. What they can do I think is take their past experiences and learn from them and get better,” Donovan said.
But with Yale defeating reign-
ing national champion UConn 45-44 on Friday, both Donovan 
and his players have to focus on 
the challenge ahead and move past the blown lead in the second half on Friday at Kansas. “This is an incredible chal-
lenge because this will be another 40-minute game for us,” Donovan said on Sunday. “Again I think one thing at this level, games 
come pretty quickly and you’ve 
got to be able to move from one competitive situation to another. We’ll have to do that (today).”MONDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Jim McElwain will get on the recruiting 
trail today, and the new coach’s job on the 
trail just got a little bit more difficult. 
Two players decommitted from the Uni-
versity of Florida’s 2015 verbal recruiting class Saturday, giving UF seven total ver-bal commitments as of publication Sunday 
night. 
Despite the defections, McElwain said 
Saturday he’s confident the class will take 
shape.
“We’ll hit the road next week, get to as 
many places as humanly possible from the recruiting standpoint, because that’s one of those things, ‘recruit daily or die,’” he said during his introductory press conference Saturday. 
“We’ve got to make sure we secure a 
great class. There’s some great commit-
ments right now, there’s some guys that 
are waiting to see what’s going to happen and what’s going on. That’s the first and foremost for what we do, is go out and do that.”
Four-star dual-threat quarterback Sher-
iron Jones was the first to pull the plug on his verbal pledge to UF. 
The Moreno Valley, California, product 
last visited Gainesville on June 7 and com-mitted the following day.
Ohio offensive lineman George Brown 
also decommitted, flipping his commit-ment to LSU. 
Brown arrived on campus in Baton 
Rouge, Louisiana, Friday for a visit, and Saturday evening tweeted a picture of him 
in an LSU jersey. 
Four hours later, he tweeted, “I Have 
Officially Committed To Louisiana State 
University,” on his Twitter account (@
MADDAWG_G). 
Brown made headlines committing to 
UF in July with what appeared at the time 
to be a live alligator, but later it was found out to be only a dwarf caiman.
McElwain met with the remaining 
coaching staff Friday night to talk about recruiting. 
UF’s current class is 95th nationally ac-
cording to Rivals.com and only 13 of 128 FBS schools have fewer verbal commit-ments after Brown and Jones left the class. 
With work to do, McElwain is confident 
the program sells itself.
“Well, No. 1 you’ve got an opportunity 
to win a national championship. That’s first and foremost,” McElwain said. “It’s about what that’s going to do for the rest of your 
life, about what being a Gator is and adjust-
ing. Look, we’re here to make sure your ex-perience is going to do nothing but set you apart for the rest of your life. And that’s what it is to be a Gator.”
Offensive line depth is of dire need for 
UF as attrition and lack of o-line signees has left a dearth at the position. 
In 2011, the Gators signed two offensive linemen, one of which is no longer with the team. It was the same story for UF in 2012, and then in 2013, the Gators signed five. 
But attrition and graduation have less-
ened that class’s impact on the 2015 Florida roster with Trevon Young and Octavius Jackson departing the program and Tren-ton Brown, who signed from a junior col-
lege, has graduated.
In 2014, the Gators signed six offensive 
linemen, and two of them have left the pro-
gram in the last week. 
Drew Sarvary’s football career came to 
an end because of concussions and Nolan Kelleher’s career is over because of linger-ing back issues.
With Tyler Moore’s declaration for the 
NFL draft in late November and the feel-ing that D.J. Humphries’ declaration is im-minent, UF may be down to only five of-fensive linemen that have played in a game 
next season.
When he was at Alabama, McElwain re-
cruited the Central Florida area among oth-
ers, signing notable recruits in running back Dee Hart and safety HaHa Clinton-Dix. 
He says he’s excited to be back recruit-
ing the state because it’s a chance build-ing relationships, something he said is the “number one” thing for him.
“I’m excited to go hit the road on Mon-
day morning,” McElwain said. “I’ll be back time unknown, until it becomes dead again next week and probably what I’m most ex-cited about is rekindling the relationships 
and getting back involved with the play-
ers that we had an effect on their lives and that’s what it’s all about.”Florida loses two recruits, down to seven commitments

�THE SOPHOMORE SCORED EIGHT 
POINTS IN THE FIRST HALF BEFORE HIS STRUGGLES BEGAN.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
Chris Walker proved to be one of Florida’s 
most dangerous offensive weapons in the ﬁ  rst 
half against Kansas.
The 6-foot-10 sophomore knocked down 
4-of-5 shots for eight points to help the Gators build a 39-24 lead at halftime. But when the Jayhawks upped their intensity level in the 
second half, Walker couldn’t do the same.
Florida lost the game by six points.
Although coach Billy Donovan said the en-
tire team was at fault for not matching Kansas’ energy, he mentioned Walker’s lack of inten-
sity speciﬁ  cally. 
“I would have liked to have played him 
more,” Donovan said, “but I think the biggest 
thing that he’s learning is how hard he has to 
play and he’s not really able to sustain a high 
level of intensity for long periods of time.”
Walker played just 15 minutes, which was 
the least amount of minutes by a Florida play-er on scholarship. Jacob Kurtz, a walk-on, was 
on the court for 12 minutes.
Donovan added that Walker’s issue with 
long-term intensity might be linked to his lack 
of experience at the collegiate level. 
Although Walker is listed as a sophomore 
for Florida, the former McDonald’s All-Amer-ican played in just 18 games last season and missed the entire non-conference slate.
To put Walker’s inexperience in perspec-
tive, he has accrued 169 minutes so far in his career. True freshman Chris Chiozza has a re-corded 159 minutes this year.
“When you get thrown into a situation where you’re playing against high-level com-
petition, sometimes you get a better opportu-
nity to learn from those experiences and don’t just having everybody tell you how great you are and he can see that, ‘The intensity level I play at is not really good enough, I’m not 
helping the team, I’m not helping myself,’” 
Donovan said.
Walker returned to Florida after his fresh-
man campaign rather than leave for the NBA 
in order to continue his education under Don-
ovan. 
But while Donovan can help Walker with 
technique or ﬁ  lm analysis, the veteran coach 
said each of his players are responsible for his 
own energy level.
“You keep trying to point it out to them 
and keep trying to explain it to them,” Dono-van said. “Eventually, they have step up and 
do it.”
Despite his short burst of vigor, Walker re-
corded a career-high 12 points while grabbing 
ﬁ  ve boards, which tied a team high. Dono-
van is hopeful Walker can provide that spark 
throughout the game rather than just in the ﬁ  rst half when Florida plays Yale tonight at 7.
“He’s doing some things where he’s grow-
ing in a positive direction,” Donovan said. “He 
gave us a positive lift in the game. … Hope-
fully we can continually have him play with a motor because when (he) does that, then he 
can get some things into the game that can im-
pact the game in a positive way, but for him not to do that it becomes challenging.”Walker still working on intensity

Coach Amanda Butler is tired of the 
slow starts that have plagued the Gators 
this season.
And after Florida (5-3) again came 
out ﬂ  at and careless with the ball against 
Florida State on Sunday, Butler could do 
nothing but emphasize the need to cor-rect the team’s inability to keep up with its opponent early.  
“Unfortunately, it’s not a new story,” 
Butler said. “We turned the ball over a lot. We started slow.”
Two rival athletic departments con-
tinued to head in opposite directions on 
Sunday afternoon as FSU (8-1) essential-
ly put away the UF women’s basketball team in the opening minutes, jumping out to an early 16-2 lead and never look-ing back. 
The Seminoles were seemingly never 
challenged, cruising to a 77-51 victory over the Gators in Tallahassee. 
The Gators committed a season-high 
30 turnovers. 
Florida, coming off an upset loss 
against Savannah State that saw the team turn the ball over 25 times, was un-able to get into an offensive rhythm and shot the ball poorly from the ﬁ  eld. 
“We’re not being pressed, we’re just 
not valuing the ball or executing with composure,” Butler said. “We’re just do-
ing a lot of things wrong.”
After switching to a zone defense, the Gators forced several turnovers and cut 
the lead to seven on a Brooke Copeland three-pointer, but it was the closest Flori-
da would get for the rest of the game. 
The Seminoles went into halftime up 
16 points, and Florida didn’t get within 
single digits the rest of the game. 
With no Gators scoring in double 
digits, Copeland led the Florida scoring with nine points, but fouled out 11 min-utes into the second half after playing just 11 minutes. 
January Miller also provided nine 
points, while freshman Haley Lorenzen added eight points and ﬁ  ve rebounds. 
“Brooke gave us a lot of energy,” 
Butler said, “It was unfortunate that she fouled out.”
“Haley got a lot of good looks down 
low. We just need to capitalize on those opportunities.”
Despite the loss, Florida has been 
encouraged by the play of its freshmen — Copeland, Lorenzen and Dyandria Anderson. 
Redshirt junior Carlie Needles had 
her third straight tough game, scoring just four points in 36 minutes and turn-ing the ball over ﬁ  ve times while not pro-viding an assist. 
Needles and fellow starting guard 
Cassie Peoples were locked down the entire night by the Seminoles defense, which forced the duo into multiple turn-overs that contributed to the early insur-mountable deﬁ  cit. Gators start slow, fall to

them and keep trying to explain it to 
them. Eventually, they have step up
