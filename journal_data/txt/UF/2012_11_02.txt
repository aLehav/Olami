 James Wilson nearly quit football before he 
had a chance to play at his best.
  He wasn’t giving up because things got 
tough or because he wasn’t getting enough 
playing time. 
  He was going to stop playing the sport that 
once made him one of the most sought-after high school players in the country because he was forced to undergo a fourth surgery on his left knee.
  Wilson had just sat out the last 10 games of 
the 2010 season recovering from surgery on the same knee. Three years earlier, he took a medi-cal redshirt as the knee underwent two opera-tions during the ﬁ  rst three months of his fresh-man year at UF.
  After redshirting, Wilson was discouraged 
and considered transferring, but he decided against it after a talk with his high school coach, Craig Howard.
  “I got in the car and I drove to Gainesville 
and I found him,” said Howard. “[I] get in the restaurant and sat down with him and said, ‘Son, you’re in the right school and the right place for your education and the right place for your football.’”
  The conversation helped convince Wilson to 
stay at Florida, and he eventually came to agree with Howard. But before reaching that point, the sixth-year senior guard worked through two more surgeries. He also dealt with fractures in both of his feet — at the same time. 
  “I texted him the other day and I said, ‘Re-
member when I drove there and told you to stay?’” Howard said. “He said, ‘Coach, I’m so glad you did. I’m so proud and excited to be a Gator, and it’s ﬁ  nally paying off for me.’”
    
  When Wilson showed up to football practice 
at Ponte V edra Nease High as a freshman in 2003, he didn’t look the part of an offensive line-man. He was close to his current height of 6 feet, 4 inches, but he weighed less than 200 pounds.
  “He was a big-boned kid,” said Danny 
Cowgill, Wilson’s strength coach at Nease. “He had like a size-14 shoe, I believe. You can tell Division I players when they walk in as fresh-men, and you could tell when he walked in as a freshman that he was going to be a Division I player.”
  Wilson bought into the Nease strength and 
conditioning program from the start, hitting the weight room with vigor. However, Howard, who now coaches at Southern Oregon, worried that the process of adding muscle contributed to injuries that nagged Wilson throughout high school. 
  As a freshman, he weighed 180 pounds. As a 
senior, he weighed more than 300 pounds.
  “I always said, ‘James, you’re getting too 
big,” his mom, Carla Wilson, said. “But he was always in the weight room, always going to the YMCA. And I do think that some of that con-tributed to his knee injuries.”
  Despite the injury struggles, James ﬂ  our-ished. As a junior, he anchored an offensive line that blocked for Tim Tebow as Nease won a state championship.
   “He was so big, so strong, so physical,” 
Howard said. “And he could run. That was what separated him. He was a guy that was 300 pounds and could run like a 190-pounder.”
  During his senior season, in 2007, James was 
the top-rated guard and the 12th-best player in the country according to Rivals.com, which ranked Tebow 22nd overall in the class of 2006.
  “As long as he stayed healthy,” Cowgill said, 
“he was going to have great success.”
  In the spring of his senior year, James com-
mitted to go join his former quarterback at Flor-ida. He had left a mark at Nease and a lasting impression on Howard.
  “I’ve coached for 38 years,” Howard said. 
“I’ve had quite a few football players that have gone on to Division I football. … James Wilson, what he was as a player for me, was as domi-nant at his position as Tim Tebow was at his.”
    
      It wasn’t all smiles for James during his ﬁ  rst 
season in Gainesville.  
  While he kept a good attitude through his 
surgeries, he still had to sit and watch. He didn’t 
feel like part of the team.
  “There was some frustration because he re-
ally wanted to be out there,” Carla said. 
  James thought about transferring as his re-
hab dragged into spring practice, but he once 
again found happiness when he returned to the ﬁ  eld.  “Everyone welcomed me back with open 
arms,” Wilson said during spring practice in 2008.
  After playing in 10 regular season games 
during the Gators’ 2008 championship season, James suffered his most debilitating injury. He had been playing with sore feet, but the inju-ries worsened in the Southeastern Conference Championship against Alabama. He was diag-nosed with  fractures in both feet following the game, conﬁ  ning him to a wheelchair for several weeks.
  At one point, he was stuck on the third ﬂ  oor 
of his dorm in the Springs Complex for ﬁ  ve days because the elevator broke.
  Day-to-day living became a challenge. Sim-
ple tasks such as navigating his dorm room turned into big ordeals.
  “He couldn’t get around,” Carla said. “He’s 
a big kid, and there’s not a whole lot of room to move around. … I’m like, ‘James, you keep run-ning into the walls.’”
  Still, James worked through it. Carla visited 
him every weekend, and the two managed to laugh and talk and keep the injuries out of their minds even though he couldn’t walk. He suc-cessfully rehabilitated his feet and went on to play in 14 games and make four starts in 2009. 
  His streak of good health ended a year later. 
James was sidelined for the ﬁ  nal 10 games of the  2010 season after re-injuring his left meniscus. Guard David Young, who played for the Gators from 2008-11, also missed most of the season af-ter suffering a broken kneecap. 
  “We were best friends,” Young said. “We 
were rehab buddies.”  Having already experienced being out for a 
signiﬁ  cant period of time, James helped Young get through the rehab process without dwelling too much on what he was missing. 
  They talked about their moms, their families 
and whatever else was going on in their lives, but they didn’t discuss injuries.
  “He helped me keep my mind off football,” 
Young said
  The guards motivated each other in rehab. 
Young said whenever one of them wanted to take a day off, the other made him get out of bed.
  James suffered another setback in the spring, 
when he had to undergo his fourth knee proce-dure. He said he came closer than ever to quit-ting football in the aftermath of the surgery but decided with friends and family to keep play-ing.
  The surgery set James back, and he was not 
at what coach Will Muschamp referred to as a “playable” weight at the start of fall camp in 2011. He began the season on the scout team but ended up appearing in 12 games. He made his ﬁ  rst start of the season in Florida’s win against Ohio State in the Gator Bowl. While James’ weight was not quite where Muschamp wanted it, the coaching staff didn’t write him off.
  “It’s always been a weight issue with James,” 
Muschamp said. “If he keeps his weight down, he’s able to play. He’s able to sustain. He’s al-ways been a very talented guy , and given the opportunity, which he did at the end of last sea-son when he got his weight under control, he’s been a productive player for us.”
  Carla thought the limited playing time had 
unintended beneﬁ  ts for her son.
  “In my mind and in my heart,” she said, “I 
think it was a blessing in disguise to give his knee some rest.”
  James and Carla discussed applying for a 
sixth year of eligibility early in the 2011 season, but James was against it. Thinking she’d never see her son play again, Carla was upset. Then she got some surprising news prior to what she thought would be his ﬁ  nal home game: senior night against Florida State. After improving physically throughout the course of the season, James changed his mind.
  “[James] was like, ‘I’ve applied for a sixth 
year, and we’ll see what they say, and next year, hopefully I’ll be able to prove myself,’” Carla said.
  
    During Florida’s win against Ohio State in 
the Gator Bowl on Jan. 2, the last game of what James thought would be his last season, he found out his request for a sixth year of eligibil-ity had been granted.
   “I was so happy for him because of how 
much he wanted it,” Young said. “It was like him getting a clean slate.”
  Things began to fall into place for Wilson, 
who stayed healthy for an entire spring practice for the ﬁ  rst time.
   “It’s totally night and day,” James said.  He came into the 2012 season 11 pounds 
lighter at 323 pounds, a weight that Howard said makes him more effective than he has ever been.   “He’s been persistent,” Howard said. “He 
hasn’t given up.  A lot of guys would quit, or leave or fade into the fog.”
  Wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. sees 
the results of James’ relentless drive every day at the locker across from his. Hammond, who is in his ﬁ  fth year at Florida, has seen most of James’ journey and believes it is a good example for inexperienced players who might encounter similar adversity.
  “It’s deﬁ  nitely a positive thing for younger 
guys who are here that are going through inju-ries or going through tough times,” Hammond said.
  On a second-and-15 play during the Gators’ 
second drive of the third quarter against South Carolina on Oct. 20, offensive coordinator Brent Pease called a screen pass to tight end Jordan Reed. James ran nearly 20 yards downﬁ  eld and threw a block on South Carolina linebacker Shaq Wilson that sprung Reed for a 39-yard gain. It was the kind of play his mom hadn’t seen him make in years.
  “I was like, ‘Damn, James, I’ve never seen 
you move that fast,’” Carla said.
  The win against the Gamecocks was the 
sixth of James’ seven starts this season. He has missed only one game, UF’s Oct. 13 win against Vanderbilt due to an orbital fracture suffered in practice.
  Those who are closest to him savor every 
moment they can watch him play. After six years, they are ﬁ  nally witnessing the Army All-American guard realize his potential.
  “I’m seeing the big James Wilson that I’ve al-
ways loved,” Young said.

Senior guard James Wilson (66) blocked for Tim Tebow (15) for three seasons at Ponte Vedra Nease High before both moved on to Florida. Although Tebow would win a Heisman Trophy, Wilson was the more heralded recruit, ranking as the nation’s 12th-best player in the class of 2007, according to Rivals.com. Tebow ranked 22nd in the class of 2006.

Gainesville Police arrested a man ear-
ly Thursday morning after he punched 
a paralyzed Marine veteran who wore a Halloween costume he thought mocked wounded soldiers.
Police charged Christopher Dabney, 22, 
of 111 NW 16th St., with abuse of a dis-abled adult, which is a felony, according to a GPD arrest report.
For Halloween, Daniel Priotti dressed 
up as a soldier, donning a camouﬂ  age uni-form and fake blood on his face.
At about 2:20 a.m., Priotti, a 35-year-
old Gainesville resident and disabled U.S. Marine veteran, was in line at the Pita Pit off West University Avenue when Dab-ney, wearing pantyhose and a pink tutu, walked into the restaurant.
Police said Priotti’s costume offended Dabney, who thought Pri-otti’s wheelchair was part of the outﬁ  t.
Johnny Mnayarji, a 
19-year-old Pita Pit em-ployee, said the two men 
exchanged a few words before Dabney suddenly attacked Priotti.
“He really pulled his 
arm back and punched him,” Mnayarji said. “The second time (Priotti) got hit, he melted off the chair.”
Dabney then shouted at Priotti as he 
lay on the ﬂ  oor. He called him a fake then went outside to the parking lot.
Moments later, GPD ofﬁ  cers arrived and 
arrested Dabney and booked him into Ala-chua County Jail at about 3 a.m. Thursday. 
He was released later that day.Contact Chris Alcantara at calcantara@

Rigid lines of wooden 
desks won’t separate stu-
dents in Warrington College of Business Administration’s new learning center. Instead, circular tables, interactive technology and open-mind-ed professors will bring them together.
The Active Learning Stu-
dio will be unveiled at 10 a.m. today in Matherly Hall, Room 120. The studio com-bines technology and collab-oration, said Tawnya Means, director of Warrington’s Center of Teaching, Learning and Assessment.
“In a traditional class-
room, you sit in a chair, wait to talk and take notes,” Means said. “With active learning, it’s application-based. Learning is more on you as a student.”
She said students will 
work together to discuss business cases, solve prob-lems and create products with team members.
The studio allows dis-
tance-learning students to work with residential stu-dents in real-time. The room features cameras, micro-phones, a video production studio and web conferencing capabilities, according to a press release.
“We’re really excited to 
offer this opportunity for both students and teachers,” Means said.
In order to take advantage 
of what the studio has to of-fer, teachers have to design their courses differently, said graduate student and instructor James Van Scotter.
The learning studio en-
courages a teamwork envi-ronment, and if students are underprepared, he said, peer pressure now plays a part in getting students to keep up with their work.
“The professor grading 
things isn’t the only incen-tive now,” he said.UF business school

� ATTENDEES DISCUSSED 
THE BLACKFACE INCIDENT.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer
About 450 people, including fac-
ulty , administration and students, 
met for a town hall meeting Thurs-day to discuss last week’s incident involving two Beta Theta Pi broth-ers who wore blackface makeup to a social.
UF professor of African-Ameri-can studies Patricia Hilliard-Nunn presented the history of blackface. She said it originated in Europe in the 1600s to mimic African people and was eventually popularized in American radio, print and ﬁ  lm. She said actors exaggerated African-American features and placed them in roles as musicians and dancers for comic relief.
“They were copying that culture 
and exploiting it for ﬁ  nancial gain,” Hilliard-Nunn said.
After her presentation, students 
expressed their opinions and pro-posed ideas to solve cultural issues at UF.
Leonard Thompson, a member of 
the currently suspended Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, discussed his feel-ings about the lack of involvement the administration had in respond-ing to the blackface incident. He said when his fraternity was suspended for hazing last year, an email was sent out to the entire Student Body about the issue. But so far, nothing has been sent out about this.

Paper tombstones hung 
from the walls of La Casita 
on Thursday, but it wasn’t because of Halloween.
UF’s Institute of Hispan-
ic/Latino Cultures and the Mexican American Student Association hosted a free Dia de Los Muertos celebra-tion at the institute’s office Thursday afternoon.
Translated as Day of the 
Dead, the celebration focused on remembering friends and family members who have died, said event director Eric Castillo. 
The holiday is mainly cel-
ebrated in Mexico.
“It’s supposed to be a day 
of joy,” the 30-year-old said.
About 80 people placed 
electronic candles at a rose-mary-adorned altar, wrote notes for the deceased and painted each other’s faces with calavera designs, which are artistic representations of skulls. 
It was the first time the 
event had been held since 2007.
Hilario Cabrera, a 20-year-old psychology and political science junior, enjoyed a cup of arroz con leche among a group of people eating Mexi-can food. He said the sweet, creamy rice pudding was his favorite dessert.
Cabrera went to the event 
to pay respect to his grand-mother, who recently passed away. 
He said he thought the 
event was a good way to raise the institute’s presence in the community.
“It should be repeated 
every single year, so people know Latino culture is on campus, and it’s embraced more,” he said.
Castillo said the event 
offered a quick Mexican im-mersion experience for stu-dents.
“We educate people about 
cultures outside of UF,” he said. “I think that’s impor -

As a nursing student at Santa Fe College, Cori 
Kate learns modern medicine. But as a designer, 
she’s inspired by the past.
The 25-year-old sews and sells upcycled clothing 
at The Eclectic Co. Vintage & Resale Shop in down-town Gainesville, where she’ll debut her new fall collection from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday. Her line is called GOSH DARN.
Kate usually makes summer clothes, but this 
show will feature darker colors, leather jackets, leg-gings, sweaters and winter dresses.
Even though the line is new, Kate’s no amateur.She started designing about five years ago to pay 
off her credit card debt, but when that was paid she kept sewing for fun. This summer, Kate moved her business to the vintage shop, which is owned by Lo-ren Keldsen and his wife.
“Cori takes great vintage fabrics and remakes 
them into something totally cool, totally unique,” Keldsen said.
She mixes floral patterns, velvet, clashing colors 
and varying textures, and she’s influenced by ’80s styles.
When she first started designing, Kate didn’t 
spend much money on supplies because all the ma-terials she used were old clothes. These days, she also buys from thrift and online stores.
“Nothing is brand new,” she said. “Everything 
is made from something that would have otherwise been thrown away.”
Her economical fabric choices keep prices low 
— most pieces range from $5 to $50. Kate said she won’t make anything she couldn’t afford herself.
“That’s why we love Cori,” Keldsen said.Even Saturday’s event won’t cost much. From 
the host to models to makeup artists, the workers are all Kate’s friends and volunteers.
Allison Garnsey, 24, will emcee the fashion show. 
She said Kate designs because she loves it, not for money or attention. GOSH DARN targets shoppers who are environmentally minded and have funky senses of style.
Right now, Kate’s goals are to continue to sell the 
line at the store and maybe move online in the fu-ture.
“I don’t ever want to make it into a large busi-
ness because it will lose part of the fun,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2012

38% NOCitizen journalism can give you a voice
On Wednesday , I gave two different presentations in 
two different classes on the same topic: citizen jour-
nalism. Despite wanting to give myself a root canal 
the night before — trying to wrap up the work for both classes and having only slept for about three hours — I realized I was delving into an extraordinary subject. If you’ve never heard of the term citizen journalism, don’t worry; I hadn’t either.
Citizen journalism is any form of journalism in which av-
erage citizens take it upon themselves to actively investigate, 
report, and disseminate information and news. This kind of reportage takes many forms — anything from blogging about a political rally to recording police brutality on a mo-bile phone.
Unlike traditional mainstream journalism, citizen journal-
ism is characterized by a lack of professional training and ed-itorial standards. It’s often freely accessible and interactive. It aims to break the stranglehold gatekeepers may possess in professional publications or outlets and it gives a voice to those who may not otherwise have one.
This phenomenon, which is also referred to as partici-
patory , public, democratic or street journalism, has played a major role in several events. The genesis of the concept is often traced back to the infamous “Zapruder ﬁ  lm,” the home movie of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, ﬁ  lmed by local business owner Abraham Zapruder on an 8-mm Bell & Howell camera.
The Zapruder ﬁ  lm was a crucial piece of evidence used 
during all investigations of the assassination, and to this day, it remains one of the most studied ﬁ  lms in history. Neverthe-less, citizen journalism has only recently begun to gain mo-mentum as a legitimate ﬁ  eld as the advent of new media has provided public citizens with multiple new technologies that can be used to document events. Perhaps the key tool used today in the practice of citizen journalism is the cellphone. Cellphones, for instance, have played a very major role in Africa, where they remain the predominant technology in a region still struggling to expand access to computers and the Internet.
In late 2007, Kenya suffered a major crisis after that year’s general election, during which several violent incidents took place throughout the country . This led to Kenyan citizens documenting these incidents via text messag-ing, which, in turn, led to a very effective online mapping tool that “mashed up” the incident loca-tions and allowed the public to see where violence was taking place.
This movement is referred to as Ushahidi, whose model 
has been used in several platforms throughout Africa to this day.
Cellphones also facilitated citizen journalism during the 
2009 to 2010 Iranian election protests and during the Arab Spring. Mobile technologies allowed protesters to not only document the protests themselves and state violence that fol-lowed, but it was mobile technologies that allowed citizens to organize themselves to begin with, mostly through text messaging and through social media platforms such as Fa-cebook.
This trend also applied to Occupy Wall Street, when the 
Adbusters Media Foundation ﬁ  rst proposed the idea for the movement through email. Once the idea spread online vi-rally, Adbusters designed a simple but striking poster to pro-mote the event, and as they say, the rest is history.
These monumental events are only a few of the most no-
table examples of how citizen journalism has proven an effec-tive way to challenge the status quo of our media, in which major corporations own our most trusted news sources and, as a result, control the conversation.
You, however, don’t have to accept this status quo. If and 
when you can, use the technology at your disposal to make a difference. 
Websites such as GlobalVoices, AllVoices, Littera Report 
and Examiner.com all allow average citizens to post reports on anything of note.

Darts & Laurels
We need to start off with a huge shout out to everyone help-
ing with the recovery efforts of the northern East Coast. Hurri-cane Sandy affected hundreds of thousands of people. We give a thank-you-and-keep-up-the-hard-work-our-thoughts-are-with-you LAUREL to the ﬁ  rst responders for Hurricane Sandy. Visit 
redcross.org to ﬁ  nd out how to help.
Remember Michael Brown? He was the director of FEMA 
during Hurricane Katrina, and he didn’t exactly handle things very well. “People are going to get frustrated — I’d just encour-age people to just kind of chill out over this whole situation,” Brown said about the response to Hurricane Sandy . We give a stop-being-a-terrible-person DART to Michael Brown. Presi-
dent Bush might’ve thought he did a “heckuva job,” but the rest of us don’t.
In a weird, but awesome, display of bipartisanship, Mayor 
Bloomberg endorsed President Obama for reelection. He’s been pretty critical of both candidates and refused to endorse either of them. He’s basing this decision on how he sees the environment and climate changing. We give a good-for-you-Bloomberg-sor-ry-your-city-got-run-over-by-a-hurricane LAUREL to Mayor 
Bloomberg.
Chris Brown is still a terrible person, in case you forgot he 
was still a thing. He dressed as a terrorist for Halloween. Yes, he went as a terrorist, with a group of his friends also dressed as terrorists. Imagine that, the way someone dresses up can be insensitive. We give a just-because-it’s-Halloween-doesn’t-give-you-an-excuse-to-be-a-butthead DART to Chris Brown or any-
one who used blackface this year.
Paying for things online just got a lot easier, which means 
spending money just got a lot easier, too. The new Google Wal-let feature will save your billing and shipping information, so you don’t have to type in dozens of ﬁ  elds to purchase something online. This will only work for sites that accept Google Wallet as a payment option, but this streamlines stuff that doesn’t need to be streamlined. We give a who-needs-to-manage-money-any-way-budgets-be-damned LAUREL to Google Wallet.
Reach for some carrot sticks instead of french fries, every-
one. There is a new initiative to remind high schoolers to make healthy choices — but the options provided for them to choose from are still not healthy . This speciﬁ  cally looks at snack food, not what’s available in the cafeteria line. We give a healthy-isn’t-a-bad-thing-it’s-a-smart-thing DART to high schools.
On a nerdy note, Gmail released a new design for its mes-
sage composition. Now, it just pops up into the existing win-dow, instead of opening a new tab. “The big improvement is that the interface is clean, stripped of all the whistles, whitespace everywhere,” said Alexis Madrigal of The Atlantic. “It’s ultra-simple.” We give a this-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction LAUREL  
to Google … again.
That’s all for this week, folks. Have a safe and great weekend, 
and we’ll see you back next week!

R omney has pretty much nailed 
down Florida,” said Brad Coker, an expert pollster from Mason-Dixon 
Polling and Research. “Unless something dramatically changes … Romney’s going to win Florida.” 
With absentee and early voting well 
under way, a Tampa Bay Times poll shows Gov. Romney in command of the toss-up state.  
This sample pertains to the traditional 
I-4 corridor that stretches from Tampa to Daytona Beach, which generally decides the way Florida will vote. With momen-tum seemingly in Romney’s favor, this poll indicated he has taken a 51 percent lead over Obama’s 45 percent in the Sun-shine State. 
Nevertheless, this poll directly con-
tradicts CNN reports of Romney leading Obama by 1 percentage point. Regard-less, Florida seems to be shifting in favor of Romney.
If you have not voted yet, do not un-
der any circumstances allow this to make you reconsider your vote or lead you to not vote. After all, the election is not just for the presidency.
This apparent shift in support among 
Democrats and Republicans from 2008 to 2012 is also evident in the newspaper en-dorsement game. Not just on a national scale, several prominent Florida news-papers across the state have ﬂ  ipped sup-port from the president to his challenger. Romney leads 49 to 41 percent among independents, and it is estimated that about 4 percent of the electorate remains undecided.
We should vote with the same or even 
greater intensity for our local and state elections as we do for the head of the executive branch of the federal govern-ment.
We see the impact of these races on a 
day-to-day basis in our lives.
Yes, the President of the United States 
is a remarkable and unique position that sets the agenda for our “great arsenal of democracy.” Yes, the President of the United States also dominates our news, politics and popular culture.  And yes, being president is something that mil-lions of young children dream of being when they grow up. However, unlike the president and even our representatives in Congress, it is our local elected leaders that ﬁ  ght for us every day.
We see the impact of these races on 
a day to day basis in our lives. These lo-cal and state elections have a much more signiﬁ  cant impact in our respective com-munities. From taxes to educa-tion  to infra-structure, these issues should dominate our thinking. 
Local ofﬁ  cials 
understand and 
work with businesses to generate the con-ditions and incentives needed to promote entrepreneurs, as well as job growth.  
Aren’t the economy and jobs the most 
important issues of this election?
Then we, the voting public, ought 
to consider our local elections with the same interest and passion as we do our presidential publics. While the Electoral College system may limit the power of voters in certain states, one vote can dra-matically impact a local election. Turnout is so unacceptably low to the degree that, at least in my hometown, an entire city’s high school graduating class can shift an election one way or the other.
However, unlike the president and 
even our representatives in Congress, it is our local elected leaders that ﬁ  ght for us every day. They understand the unique conditions of our towns and mu-nicipalities like no other. They realize our cities unique, individual needs from speciﬁ  c infrastructure to leisure facilities like parks to the necessary conditions for affordable housing. 
Being that so many leave these sections 
on the ballot blank or, in a non-presiden-tial election year, do not even show up to the polls, each and every individual vote carries signiﬁ  cant weight.
As such, take care and research local 
candidates. There is no excuse this year to not vote in local races. There is even less of an excuse in other election years where poor turnout leads to absolutely no line at the polls. It can be as easy as ﬁ  lling out a ballot at home and mailing it.
These are the circumstances that mat-
ter most, in which we, the people of the United States of America, notice an im-pact each and every day we go about our lives.
Do not settle just voting for Romney 
or Obama, or fall whim to popular belief. Strive to research, and complete your en-tire ballot on Tuesday.
After all, it is this type of grassroots 
change that truly does make a differ-ence.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Editor’s Note: This is the second of two 
articles that explain the constitutional and local amendments on Tuesday’s ballot.
Amendment 8 – Religious Freedom
Nonprofit organizations with religious ties 
currently provide services to citizens without financial help from the state, although they receive federal funds. Amendment 8 would add a constitutional base to prevent the state’s ability to deny funds based on reli-gious affiliation.
Daniel Smith, a UF political science profes-
sor, said the language could lead to interpre-tations in favor of charter school vouchers.
But Sheila Hopkins, Florida Conference of 
Catholic Bishops associate director for social concerns/respect life, said the proposal isn’t about vouchers.
“It really applies to religious organiza-
tions providing secular services like food banks, substance abuse treatment or HIV counseling,” she said.
Tony Carvajal, the Collins Center for 
Public Policy’s chief operations officer, said if passed, the proposal would allow public funds to be distributed to organizations with religious roots as long as the services are available to everyone.
Amendment 9 – Homestead Property Tax 
Exemption for Surviving Spouse of Military Veteran or First Responder
This amendment proposes a full property 
tax exemption be given to living spouses of military veterans who died while on active duty and first responders who died on the 
job.
Carvajal said this ex-
emption is already in place as a statute. Passage of this proposal would extend and solidify the benefit in the state’s constitution.
Amendment 10 – Tan-
gible Personal Property Tax Exemption
This proposal would provide a $25,000 tax 
exemption to those who own property val-ued between $25,000 and $50,000. Businesses with lots of equipment or other goods are most affected by this proposed amendment. Household goods, money, motor vehicles, airplanes and boats don’t count, said Rodney Clouser, professor and associate chair of the UF Food and Resource Economics Depart-ment.
Although proponents claim it will help 
grow small businesses, Clouser said it’s also possible local taxes could be higher for those unaffected by the proposed amendment be-cause exemptions would be tax revenue tak-en from localities.
Amendment 11 – Additional Homestead 
Exemption; Low-income Seniors Who Main-tain Long-term Residency on Property; Equal to Assessed Value
Low-income seniors who have lived in 
the same house for more than 25 years would qualify for another property tax exemption under Amendment 11.
Carvajal said it would give local govern-
ments — not the state — power to regulate property taxes for seniors. 
If passed, he said the proposed amend-
ment permanently allows counties to pro-vide the exemption and does not require that counties adopt the measure.
Amendment 12 – Appointment of Stu-
dent Body President to Board of Governors of the State University System
This proposal would change how a stu-
dent representative is selected for the Board of Governors, the body that oversees the Florida university system. Currently, the chair of the private organization Florida Stu-dent Association becomes the representative, said UF SG Director of External Affairs Billy Vranish.
The amendment, if passed, would man-date that the Board of Governors appoints the new student representative from one of the 11 universities’ Student Body presidents, he said.
Local InitiativesQuestion 1: Fix our roads Alachua Coun-
ty: Funding road improvements by levying a three-fourths percent sales surtax
This proposal would create a 0.75 percent 
sales tax to fund road improvements in Ala-chua County.
Mark Sexton, Alachua County spokes-
man, said the surtax would generate $22 mil-lion annually and about $330 million over its 15-year lifespan. Everyone in Alachua Coun-ty would pay the tax, which excludes grocer -
ies, property, rent or medicine. He said up to 30 percent of the tax revenue will be paid by visitors to Alachua County.
Question 2: Renewal of the existing one 
mil ad valorem tax for school district operat-ing expenses
In the face of massive state budget cuts, 
the county added an extra tax to help fund the Alachua County School District. This item is asking voters if this tax should get renewed to keep funding the school district.
Smith, the political science professor, said 
after $1 billion in public education cuts from the state legislature last year, Alachua Coun-ty needs to maintain this revenue stream.

Staff President Sharon M. Burney said faculty 
members from all around campus have come up to talk to her about racist incidents that have hap-pened at the university.
“This is just the beginning,” she said. “We 
need to have these dialogues because you have a perfect storm, and it’s now erupting.”
Justin Hosbey, the first vice president of the 
Black Graduate Student Organization, reiterated the five recommendations he presented to the Student Senate on Tuesday. 
The recommendations included an official 
statement describing the event and the univer -
sity’s response to it, a formal apology from the students who were in the picture wearing black-face, a cultural competency training program for all Greek organizations and as part of the general undergraduate education curriculum and an ad-dendum to the university code of conduct to de-fine blackface as hate speech.
Beta Theta Pi president Ethan McMahon said 
ignorance is not an excuse for the offensive act.
“We want to be a part of the process to find a 
solution,” he said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Dave 
Kratzer addressed everyone in attendance. He said the next step is devising a way to take the ideas expressed at the meeting and put them into effect.
Although UF President Bernie Machen was not 
in attendance, his assistant Jamal Sowell spoke.
“This conversation has to keep going,”  he 
said. “Your voice has to be heard, but it can’t be stopped.”

ShandsCair, the air rescue and 
critical care transport system for 
Shands at UF, will broaden its ho-rizons with two new helicopters within the next year.
On Thursday, ShandsCair un-
veiled a new helicopter, ShandsCair 3, stationed at a small community hospital in Perry , Fla. ShandsCair already has helicopters stationed in Gainesville and south of Ocala.“I live in Perry , and in a lot of 
emergency situations, people are transported to Shands,” said Ellie Heartsfield, a 21-year-old nursing senior. “Investing this money is di-rectly beneficial to distant communi-ties.”
In about a year, there will be a 
larger, more specialized replacement for the current helicopter Shand-sCair has stationed in Gainesville. The new aircraft, called the EC155, will have larger cabin space and a range of about 360 nautical miles, said Staccie Allen, ShandsCair pro-gram director.
The larger range will allow the 
new aircraft to transport patients from the Panhandle and southern Florida to Shands without the use of multiple vehicles or refueling.
“It will allow us to get patients 
definitive care faster,” Allen said.
The cabin of the ShandsCair 1 
was sometimes too small for obese patients, the rescue of more than one patient at a time and patients con-nected to life-sustaining equipment, Allen said.
Ed Jimenez, senior vice president 
and chief operating officer for the hospital, said ShandsCair 1 is 8 years old and has seen about 4,300 hours of flight time. It’s not unsafe, he said, but replacing it is “a safe and proper approach” to continuing Shands’ quality of care.
Jimenez said Eurocopter, a global 
helicopter manufacturing company, is currently building the EC155. In the meantime, ShandsCair will use a rented helicopter in order to keep from adding more flight hours to ShandsCair 1.
The hospital plans to sell Shand-
sCair 1 when its replacement is available, Jimenez said.
The transport system started 
in 1981 and has transported about 48,000 patients, Allen said.
She described all of the Shand-
sCair vehicles as miniature mobile intensive care units.
“It is the highest level of critical 
care outside of the hospital,” Allen said.

 Defensive tackle Leon Orr will be out Sat-
urday after spending time in the hospital this 
week with the ﬂ  u, coach Will Muschamp said.
  Anthony Pass, a team doctor, approached 
Muschamp on Tuesday and told the coach they needed to admit Orr into the hospital to receive an IV .
  “Right now for the game, Leon Orr will be 
out,” Muschamp said on Thursday. “He has gotten really sick. He’s going to be ﬁ  ne. He’s got about a 72-hour deal. He had to go and get some ﬂ  uids in him.”
  Orr has recorded 13 tackles and 4.5 tackles 
for loss while backing up redshirt senior Omar Hunter this season.
  Muschamp couldn’t pinpoint when the 
ﬂ  u popped up in the locker room, but said on Thursday that safety Matt Elam missed “some time” on Wednesday. A few other undisclosed players experienced symptoms on Monday and Tuesday.
  Muschamp expected Elam to return to 
practice on Thursday.
  “We get [the sick players] out,” Muschamp 
said about dealing with the outbreak. “It’ll get through your locker room quick.”  
Injury update: Buck linebacker Lerentee Mc-
Cray (ankle) and left tackle Xavier Nixon (knee) are questionable for Saturday’s game against Missouri.
  Muschamp said on Tuesday that McCray 
was probable and would return to practice on Wednesday.
  Nixon twisted his knee against Georgia 
on Saturday after center Jonotthan Harrison pushed a defender into him.
  If McCray and Nixon do not play, Florida 
will depend on two freshmen.
  Defensive end Dante Fowler Jr. and left 
tackle D.J. Humphries stepped in for the two players when they suffered injuries earlier this season.
  Fowler leads all UF freshmen with three 
tackles for loss.
  “(It’s) hard to play as a freshman in any 
situation, much less the [Southeastern Confer-ence],” Muschamp said. “He’s been very pro-ductive.”
  Muschamp endorses Pease: If offensive coor-
dinator Brent Pease seeks a head coaching job 
when the 2012 season comes to a close, he will have Muschamp’s support.
  “He’s a really good football coach, and I en-
dorse him 100 percent,” Muschamp said.
  Past UF assistants who have left Gainesville 
recently to take head coaching jobs include Dan Mullen, Charlie Strong, Dan McCarney, Charlie Weis and Steve Addazio.
  With the Gators at No. 8 (7-1, 6-1 SEC) and exceeding expectations, Pease may be the next to go.
  Muschamp hired Pease in January to re-
place Weis.
  Muschamp and Pease crossed paths re-
cruiting defensive tackle Vincent “Sweet Pea” Burns when Muschamp was at Valdosta State and Pease was at Northern Arizona in 2000.
  While at LSU, Muschamp admired Pease’s 
work as Kentucky’s offensive coordinator. Pease and Boise State defensive coaches visited Muschamp’s defensive coaching staff in Aus-tin, Texas, to talk football while Muschamp served as Texas’ defensive coordinator.
  “I personally knew him pretty well, so that 
helped on the other end of it,” Muschamp said. “You have a little bit better comfort level when you know somebody.”

Brand Picks Column usually make our picks each week 
without a second thought, exercising gusto, guts and a bit of bravado. How-ever, we’ll all make picks come Tues-day that we’ve carefully considered, and we encourage you to do the same. That being said, the presidential race has featured plenty of mudslinging and with only 10 games separating ﬁ  rst and last place in the Picks Standings, things are getting chippy amongst the pickers. We’re talking personal insults. Despite the bad blood boiling, we’re trying to run a clean race here. But hey, no prom-ises!
  Now, onto the picks!
  LSU (+9.5) will punch Alabama so 
hard there will be no chads left hang-
ing because…
  The primaries have been a cake-
walk for Nick Saban and Alabama. The Crimson Tide’s eight opponents this season have an average record of 4.4-3.6. Meanwhile, the Tigers have won back-to-back games against ranked op-ponents. LSU is battle-tested, and this season, Alabama has won as easily as, well, a Republican running for ofﬁ  ce in Alabama.
 —JOE MORGAN
The Crimson Tide (-9.5) will sweep 
the Tigers in an electoral landslide be-cause….
Alabama   has the master politician: 
Nick Saban. We are all constantly en-tertained by The Mad Hatter, whether he is eating grass, calling an ill-advised trick play that somehow works or al-lowing a live Tiger into his stadium. But those gimmicks won’t ﬂ  y in this grind-it-out election. The cool, calm and col-lected Saban will have his top-ranked squad ready to hit the campaign trail. Roll Tide!

  Leading the pack at 44-28 is Rivals’ Bryan “I’ve got a, uh, skin 
condition” Holt, who went to the store this week to buy some 
more lotion. Maybe he needs some ointment to soothe the burn of his recent rejections by the various women he meets at Mid-town. Or maybe it’s something else.
    Sitting in second at 41-31 is The Associated Press’ Mark 
“Heads up!” Long, who walked right into a pole after hanging up on a phone call this week. Wow. There’s really not much to say here. It’s kind of mean to make fun of an old man with ter-rible depth perception.
    Up for bronze with a 40-32 record is alligatorSports editor 
Greg “OH MY GOD! DON’T GO IN THE BASEMENT!” Luca, who is too invested in reruns of VH1’s “Scream Queens,” which is a reality show that has previously determined roles in Saw VI and Saw 3D. Jesus, man.
Tied with Greg is Matt “KOBE!” Watts, who is way too ex-
cited about his ability to shoot cigarette butts into a coffee cup. This deﬁ  nitely tops Friday night Netﬂ  ix viewing and cuddling with slutty Durka as your most athletic activity. 
  In ﬁ  fth at 38-34 is Jason “Don’t be a violator, sweetie,” Lieser, 
who is keeping his daughter in line by threatening to send Geor-gia linebacker Jarvis Jones after her. This beats boarding school in Haiti as your worst parenting move to date. 
  Sporting a .500 record at 36-36 is alligatorSports writer Josh “Easy, breezy Cover Girl” Jurnovoy, who showed off way too much knowledge about makeup in his Monday column. Josh, it’s OK if you wear makeup and dress like Donna Summers late at night. You need to indulge those urges. We just don’t want to hear about it.
In seventh with a 35-37 record is Joe “Planned parenthood“ 
Morgan, who is already shopping for his not-even-in-the-works child’s ﬁ  rst Braves jersey . Just because Chipper is your idol doesn’t mean your kids will care in 2037.
    And in dead-ass last, with a piss-poor record of 34-38 is al-

Top-seeded Florida  plays fifth-seeded Missouri  in 
the SEC Tournament semifinals tonight at 7:30 p.m. in 
Orange Beach, Ala.  UF is playing without All-American 
injured center back Kat Williamson, who has been side -
lined since September. Replacing Williamson is Christen 
Westphal, who was recently named to the All-SEC second team and All-Freshman team, and sophomore Karina Gutsche, who has started five games this season.
No. 13 Florida will play Georgia tonight at 7 p.m. in 
the O’Connell Center  without its team captain Betsy 
Smith due to a right ankle injury. But Tangerine Wiggs proved she can still excel without her fellow redshirt se-nior on the court after she set the UF hitting percentage record with a .929 clip on Friday. Coach Mary Wise said Wiggs has taken her game to the next level amid the Gators’ challenges this season.
Florida  will host Texas A&M Friday  for a dual-swim  
meet. The UF women’s team  is ranked 11th  in the 
nation, while the women’s team for A&M is ranked No. 4 . Freshman Natalie Hinds will compete against 
two friends who swim for the Aggies, Claire Brandt and Romy Landeck. The Gators’ men’s team (2-0) will look to extend its winning streak against the Aggies.Volleyball

Forward Will Yeguete (15) attempts a shot in UF’s 
exhibition against Nebraska-Kearney on Thursday.
  KATIE AGOSTIN
 Alligator Staff Writer  
   
 With 15:25 remaining in the second 
half, junior Will Yeguete took the ball to 
the hoop and extended the Gators’ lead to 14 with a two-handed slam. 
After missing the last nine games of 
the 2011-12 season due to a fractured left foot suffered on Feb. 21, Yeguete was back on the court with a lot of energy on Thursday night. 
  Entering the exhibition against Ne-
braska-Kearney, coach Billy Donovan’s biggest concern for No. 10 Florida was its ability to rebound. 
Donovan even said he’d been disap-
pointed by Yeguete’s rebounding per-formance in the days leading up to the exhibition.
Yeguete switched gears on Thursday, 
leading all players with 11 rebounds af-ter averaging 6.3 per game last year. 
The forward also tacked on 20 points 
while hitting 80 percent of his shots as he led Florida to a 101-71 win against Nebraska-Kearney in the O’Connell Center. 
Yeguete also hit 4 of 5 shots from the 
free-throw line after hitting just 35.9 per-cent of his tries last season. 
  “I give him a lot of credit, because I 
think the things I pointed out to him he 
really tried to address,” 
Donovan said. “I’ve seen a different player (and) a different atti-tude.”
  Yeguete added: “I 
think we could’ve done better (at rebounding), but personally I just 
wanted to go out there and at least get more than 10 rebounds. I want to prove [Donovan] wrong. I want to prove (to him) that we can be a good team and we can rebound.”
  Although Donovan was pleased with 
Yeguete’s defense, the rest of the Gators did not draw such high praise. 
Florida outrebounded its Division II 
opponent by just three. 
  “I was really surprised and disap-
pointed ... with how we played defen-sively collectively as a group,” Donovan said. 
“I am extremely alarmed and con-
cerned about our team on that end of the ﬂ  oor.” 
  Despite the Gators’ shortcomings on 
defense, Donovan was impressed by the performances of UF’s four freshmen. 
  Freshman guard Michael Frazier II 
led the Gators with 21 points on 5-of-6 shooting from behind the arc in just 17 minutes. 
Freshman Braxton Ogbueze rounded 
out the top performers, ﬁ  nishing third on the team with 15 points. 
Together, the freshmen accounted for 
almost  half of Florida’s total points. 
  “The young guys, they were provid-
ing intensity,” senior Kenny Boynton said. “They were rebounding, they got shots and they also were scoring.”

The first time Neiron Ball rushed the 
passer during fall camp, Florida defensive 
coordinator Dan Quinn knew he might have something special. 
All defensive line coach Bryant Young 
could do was smile. Quinn marveled at Ball’s combination of quickness and size. 
“I saw him go right past the guy,” Quinn 
said. “We had just added a pass rusher here that we didn’t even know about.”
How could Quinn have known? Quinn 
was hired in January 2011, and Ball missed UF’s 2011 spring and fall seasons with an ar -
teriovenous malformation (AVM). The con-genital condition occurs when a blood vessel ruptures near the brain, and it forced Ball to suffer through many hours of agony in the hospital.
“It was like the worst headache ever,” 
Ball said. “The closest thing I can think is somebody just smushing my brain.”
Ball eventually recovered, and in June he 
was cleared to play. He has appeared in ev-ery game this season and is expected to play again on Saturday when No. 8 Florida (7-1, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) faces Missouri (4-4, 1-4 SEC) on Saturday at 12:00 p.m. in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
The transition from a year in and out of 
the hospital to a starting role in the South-eastern Conference has not been easy. 
The 231-pound Ball said he is still five 
pounds under his ideal playing weight, which makes dealing with the grind of the season that much more difficult. 
“I ain’t used to it like I was,” Ball said. 
“Now my body is kind of beat up. I’m still fighting through it.”
Ball is also learning a new defensive 
scheme, a process he said is “coming along.” When Ball played in 13 games as a freshman in 2010, Urban Meyer was coach and Teryl Austin was calling the defensive plays.  
Quinn has seen Ball improve from week 
to week. Ball has notched nine tackles and made his first career interception on Satur -
day off a batted pass by Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray. 
“[Ball is] a really good player,” coach Will 
Muschamp said. “When you miss that much time, it doesn’t come back as easily as it does for others. It’s come back very quickly for him.” 
Still, after four to six months away from 
the weight room, Ball needs to get stronger. 
Muschamp said Ball’s flexibility, quick-
ness and explosiveness have the Gators ex-cited about his potential. 
“We’re going to make him live in the 
weight room for about six months,” Mus-champ said. “He’s got a promising career in front of him.” 
In the meantime, Ball will play under -
weight. Compared to the other things he’s overcome in the past year, it isn’t that much of an obstacle. He’s just happy to be on the field again.
“I’m thankful for that, because there has 
been some adversity,” Ball said. “I’m just ready to finish fighting through it.”
