Twenty-ﬁ  ve years ago, UF 
student Tiffany Sessions left her 
apartment for a walk and never 
returned.
Today, the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce will release new 
information about the case. It will 
also name a suspect: deceased se-
rial killer Paul Rowles, according to TiffanySessions.com.
The sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce plans to ad-
dress “signiﬁ  cant developments” 
and give more details so the pub-lic can help move the case for-
ward, it said in a news release.
“Details of the investigation, 
case photographs, and informa-tion regarding the new suspect

A new smart-scoring system for UF’s 
popular online general psychology course 
has students questioning whether technol-
ogy should have a place in the grading process.
The system, called Writing Space, 
grades student essays within seconds of their submission and was ﬁ  rst put into use 
18 months ago after more than two decades 
of research and development by Pearson.
Wendy Gordon, the company’s execu-
tive marketing manager, said the system uses patented knowledge-analysis tech-nologies to ﬁ  nd correlations between sub-
mitted content and more than 400 essays 
graded previously by expert human read-ers.
The program assesses both the content 
and the mechanical aspects of writing, she said.  
“One of the beneﬁ  ts of having this type 
of scoring is that it takes the subjectiv-ity out,” Gordon said. “The way a human 
grades the ﬁ  rst paper may be different than 
the way the last one is graded.”
UF psychology lecturer Nicole Dorey 
said she has seen student scores improve since the technology became available last year.
However, some students still aren’t sat-
isﬁ  ed.
Julia Geraldeli, an 18-year-old UF ex-
ploratory freshman, said she could live with the grades she has received, but not until she knows how they were calculated.
She said any comments and sugges-
tions for improvement she received along with her grades have been vague.
“I feel like I’m doing what they’re ask-
ing and answering all parts of the ques-tion,” Geraldeli said. “I have no idea how 
it’s working.”Students wary of electronic

Next year, the Innovation Square will 
be home to more than just good ideas. 
Plans are in the works for an off-
campus residence hall expected to open 
in August 2015 intended for UF students with an entrepreneurial drive.
Inﬁ  nity Hall is speciﬁ  cally designed 
for students who wish to one day own their own businesses, said Norb Dunkel, associate vice president for UF Student Affairs.
“Students living in the residence hall 
will be exposed to ﬁ  nancial advisers, venture capitalists and company CEOs,” Dunkel said.
Signet Enterprises will privately own and develop the hall. It will be located on the north side of Innovation Square, ﬁ  ve blocks east of Tigert Hall.
The project is estimated to cost $20 
million, Dunkel said.
Ed Poppell, CEO of Innovation Square, 
said Signet is responsible for purchasing the land, building the property and main-taining the residence hall. 
Through a partnership with the com-
pany, UF will run the residence life and programming aspects of the facility, Dun-kel said.
Poppell said he thinks Inﬁ  nity Hall will 
be the ﬁ  rst residence hall in the nation to be built from the ground up to foster un-dergraduate entrepreneurial students.
“We are continuing to develop the 
ecosystem of the entrepreneurial spirit,” he said. 
Ariana Figueroa, an 18-year-old In-
novation Academy journalism freshman, said she feels many students in the Acad-emy will be interested in living in the new Off-campus residence hall to 
draw entrepreneurial students

Students can watch an “Amer-
ica’s Got Talent” quarterﬁ  nalist 
Friday for free at 7 p.m. 
Hosted at the UF Baptist Col-
legiate Ministries building across the street from Library West, the event will showcase UF student 
David Ferman.
He began his comedic jug-
gling endeavors as a child and 
has since set the world record for most balls ever juggled. Fer-
man has appeared on  “Good 
Morning America” and “Fox & Friends” as well as at Gator Growl 2013.
His most popular appearance, 
however, was on the eighth sea-son of “America’s Got Talent,” which premiered in June 2013.   
During his live performance, Ferman juggled ﬁ  reballs while 
hanging upside down over a 
drum of gasoline.
He com-
pleted an “im-pressive” au-
dition for the 
BCM Comedy 
Night about a month ago, 
said Jacob Wil-
liams, BCM 
president, a 21-year-old UF in-dustrial engineering junior.
“He’s looking to perform 
some and keep his show fresh while taking classes,” Williams said. “We kind of lucked into him because he just happens to 
go to UF.”
Ferman is a 19-year-old UF 
accounting sophomore whose 
dream is to “get a show in Las Vegas at some point.”  
His shows typically include 
a combination of comedy, jug-gling, stunts and audience par-ticipation. 
“It’s a lot different than a nor-
mal stand-up show,” Ferman said.
BCM Comedy Night will also 
feature Up in the Rafters, an im-
prov comedy group, which will 
perform before and after Fer-man, according to ufbcm.org.
Ryan Kaufman, one of the Up 
in the Rafters members, said the 
group usually pulls a member 
out of the audience in each seg-ment.   
“We’re very interactive with 
the audience,” said the 21-year-old UF criminology junior. “If they’re having fun, we’re having fun.”UF student’s got talent, will perform

Recurso UF, a nonproﬁ  t inter-
national development organization 
with overseas initiatives in health, education and development, is planning its ﬁ  rst service trip to 
Lima, Peru, to celebrate its 10th an-
niversary and return to its found-ers’ birthplace.
Nicole Dagata, a 21-year-old UF 
economics senior and the trip’s di-rector, said Recurso is partnering with Building Dignity, a commu-nity development nonproﬁ  t organi-zation in Villa El Salvador, Peru, for 
its trip from May 7 to 27. 
Volunteers will serve at a hos-
pital for underprivileged children, 
but Dagata said she’s most looking forward to the youth leadership and empowerment retreat.
“It’s a project we came up with; 
it’s our signature project,” Dagata 
said. “We’ve never done a camping 
trip with the kids, so I am looking forward to that long weekend.” 
Registration closes March 14. So 
far, seven UF students have com-mitted to the trip.

director George Ugartemendia, a 21-year-old UF biology and history

inspire others living in Gainesville,” Ugartemendia said. “My biggest goal is to change our way of think-
ing and inspire us to pursue a more 
sustainable lifestyle.”Students plan Peru trip

Ronald Boyett, a 20-year-old UF 
finance and sports management 
sophomore, said even though stu-
dents who know the material should do fine, he is upset by the technol-
ogy’s inconsistency.
“The first assignment I had I 
thought I did a better job and I got an eight. I don’t think the second one 
was as well-written, but I got a 10,” Boyett said. “There’s a bit of an ac-
curacy issue there.”
Dorey said although the essays 
graded using this technology ac-count for about only 7 percent of students’ total course grade, she has 
kept the option open for students to 
disagree with their computer-gener-
ated score.
 “I have a dispute process so if 
they’re not happy with the grading … I’ll grade it by hand for them,” she said.
Geraldeli said she’s glad students 
are still able to request that their pa-pers be graded the old-fashioned 
way.
“At least that way we could get 
real feedback … We could ask ques-tions and understand why we got 
something wrong,” she said. “A computer can’t do that.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2014

UF’s Center for Undergraduate 
Research has been working on estab-
lishing a new course number specifi-cally for undergraduate research in every department and college at the 
university.
Anne Donnelly, director of the 
center, said as long a student is en-
rolled in any other class at UF, he or she has the option to register for un-dergraduate research for zero credit hours.
The course will show up on the student’s transcript, but they will not have to pay for the research class if they choose not to take the course 
for credit, though taking the course 
for credit is an option.
“The big message is that research 
is for everyone, not just for scien-tists and engineers,” Donnelly said. “That’s the biggest misconception — that and when students don’t think that research is for them.”
Most of  UF’s colleges already 
have this new course option in place, and the remaining departments will be finalizing their course options soon, Donnelly said. This course is not available through the Integrated Student Information System, ISIS, so students who are interested will have to talk to their advisers about enrolling.
Previously, there was an oppor-
tunity for students to participate in 
an independent study, Donnelly 
said. However, this did not neces-sarily mean doing research as an undergraduate.
Ben Dunn, a distinguished pro-
fessor in biochemistry and molecu-lar biology and the director for the UF Science for Life program, said he tries to help students find research opportunities that interest them.
“My role in this program is to help 
undergraduate students, in particu-lar young undergraduate students like freshmen and sophomores, get 
associated with laboratories on cam-
pus that are doing research of some type,” Dunn said.
Dunn said one way he tries to get students interested in research is by inviting three different faculty members to come and make presen-
tations about their research in one of 
his classes.
Lindsey Backman, a 20-year-old 
UF biochemistry and classics junior, said she got involved with her re-search through Dunn’s class and the Science for Life program.
“It’s been a great experience for 
undergraduate students to be able 
to participate that much in the lab,” 
Backman said. “Learning so many techniques has been very reward-ing.”

The majority of these students were as-
signed Beaty Towers as their residence hall 
this year and are used to more spacious living conditions than most freshmen experience, she said.
“I think it’s going to be extremely benefi-
cial for incoming freshmen,” Figueroa said.
The contemporary-style residence hall is 
designed to hold 284 students and eight un-dergraduate staff members. 
The five-floor building will offer multiple 
room styles.Students can choose from connected dou-
ble rooms that share a bathroom and living room, single rooms connected by a bathroom or suites. 
There will be a kitchen on each floor with a 
“dirt wall” — a glass wall that can be written on — at the end of the hallways, Dunkel said. 
Similar to Hume Hall, males and females 
can live on the same floor, but each room will be single-sex. Dunkel said rates are also ex-pected to be comparable to Hume’s.
The ground floor will feature a large lob-
by, collaboration space and rooms for small-group work and business planning.
Groundbreaking for Infinity Hall is expect-
ed to be in late March or early April.infinity , from page 1Rowles was sent to prison and paroled before the Sessions case
the public that may help solve this 
case,” according to the release.
Rowles, who died in prison last 
year, was jailed for at least two murders, a kidnapping and sexual battery. 
He was sent to prison for killing 
and raping a 20-year-old in 1972, life paroled in 1985 and moved to Gainesville in 1988.
Sessions, a blonde 20-year-old 
UF finance junior wearing red sweatpants and a white sweatshirt, 
disappeared Feb. 9, 1989. 
She told her roommate she was 
going for her nightly walk from 
the Casablanca East condomini-
ums down Williston Road at about 
6 p.m. 
When Sessions wasn’t back by 
8 p.m., her roommate called the police.
On Monday, officers were exca-
vating an area near the intersection of SW Williston Road and SW 13th Street behind All Star Sports Bar, 
where they have reason to believe they may find more clues. 
That’s where, in March 1992, 
police found the buried body of 
21-year-old Santa Fe College stu-dent Elizabeth Foster. She was one 
of Rowles’ victims.
An autopsy showed she had 
been sexually assaulted and beaten 
to death, according to a warrant af-fidavit.
While Foster was missing, of-
ficers searched many of the same areas — including Bivens Arm Nature Park, Morningside Nature 
Center and part of Paynes Prairie — they had in 1989, when Sessions disappeared. But at the time, au-
thorities insisted there were no im-mediate links between the cases.
Cpl. Larry Roberts told the Al-
ligator in 1992 that “‘the only simi-larity I can see is we have two dis-appeared young ladies.’”
In 1992, then-Alachua County 
Sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Spencer 
Mann said there was no other evi-
dence that connected the Foster and Sessions cases.
At the site police were excavat-
ing Wednesday evening, bright yellow sheriff’s line tape wove in 
and out of trees on the edge of a 
wooded area. 
Most of the people at the scene 
had gone back to their homes and 
offices to prepare for the next day 
— a day that Sessions’ friends and family members will hopefully re-turn home from with more infor-mation as to why their loved one 
never did.
People who think they may have 
information about this incident can 
call the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-fice at 352-384-3323.

A local celebrity’s younger brother was ar-
rested Tuesday after violating probation from a 
previous drug charge.  
Devon Charles Lochte, the younger brother of 
Olympian, reality TV character and UF alumnus 
Ryan Lochte, was arrested Tuesday by Alachua 
County Sheriff’s deputies for a violation of pro-bation after a urine sample tested positive for chemicals found in marijuana.
On Valentine’s Day 2012, Gainesville Police 
arrested the 23-year-old UF student on charges of marijuana possession and intent to sell. Earlier in the year, he sold about two grams of weed to a source with the Gainesville Alachua County 
Drug Task Force, according to court records. He 
was later sentenced to two years of drug offender probation in March 2013.
A drug test in January revealed he violated his 
probation, according to records. Lochte’s urine sample tested positive for chemicals found in 
marijuana called Cannabinoids. However, he de-
nied using weed after the test 
results came out, according to records.
As part of his probation, 
Lochte is required to donate money to a local substance 
abuse treatment center, par-ticipate in a rehabilitation 
course and complete 200 hours 
of community service. As of 
Jan. 22, Lochte completed 61 community service hours and had not made the donation. He com-pleted the rehabilitation requirement last year.
Officers booked Lochte into the Alachua 
County Jail Tuesday morning. He was released Wednesday afternoon on his own recognizance.Little Lochte violates probation

For Courtney Tye, work wasn’t just 
a job — it was her passion.
“She had a love of life and the out-
doors, birds and animals, and she’s just 
always a joy to the people around her,” 
said Barry, her husband. “We’re gonna 
miss her.”
Tye, a Gainesville native, passed 
away due to complications during childbirth Saturday. She was 30.
Her friends, family and coworkers 
praised the UF graduate student and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission wildlife biologist for her 
dedication not only to the environment 
but also the creatures that live in it.
Tye’s work with fox squirrels, an im-
periled species, contributed greatly to management plans for the species’ ben-eﬁ  t. She even set up an online database in which anyone in Florida can report a fox squirrel sighting to help keep track of the species.
Tye made an impression on people, 
too. 
“Courtney was a bright spot in our 
agency,” said Nick Wiley, executive di-rector of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 
Tye started as a laboratory ﬁ  eld as-
sistant about eight years ago and quick-ly worked her way through the ranks.
“She was immediately seen as some-
one we wanted deep in the program,” Wiley said. “She was deﬁ  nitely pas-sionate about what she did.”
Tye was also completing graduate 
work for a master’s degree, said Bill 
Giuliano, a professor in UF’s Depart-

IN MEMORIAM
� IT’S MODELED AFTER THE NOW-
DEFUNCT GAINESVILLEBANDS.COM.
ROBIN ANDREWS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A new website has taken center stage to spread 
the word about bands coming to local venues.
The mobile and desktop versions of gaines-
villeshows.com went live Tuesday for fans to access 
an in-depth list of upcoming shows as well as pro-
ﬁ  les for bands and venues.
The setup was passed along from the former 
gainesvillebands.com, which went ofﬂ  ine last year.
“It had been around for years, and when it went 
down in 2013, I felt frustrated that there wasn’t that 
readily available list online anymore,” wrote PJ Fancher, web developer at Digital Brands, the com-pany that facilitated the website, in an email.
Fancher developed a program that compiles up-
coming show information and ﬁ  nds data from the surrounding areas to create new proﬁ  les for bands and venues. 
One of the venues listed on the site is Lightnin’ 
Salvage, the store attached to Satchel’s Pizza.  
Night manager Danny Lore said the site will do 
more than beneﬁ  t showgoers.
“The venues will gain by having our schedules 
available and the bands can promote their shows 
easily,” Lore said.
Hannah Neville, a UF English sophomore, said 
the site is needed in a city with so many low-proﬁ  le 
shows.
“For as much good music as there is in Gainesville, 
there needs to be more advertisement,” the 19-year-old said, “and it would be really nice for it to all be in one place instead of just random ﬂ  iers.”Local app, site

case reopened: 
Why cold cases matter
In 1989, a young UF student named Tiffany Sessions van-
ished. 
The authorities, her parents and her peers were shocked 
— no trace was left of Sessions. She had gone for a routine walk along Williston Road and simply never returned. 
“In desperation, Pat Sessions, a marketing executive, did 
what he knows how to do best,” CBS reported. “He organized press conferences, (brought) in famous faces like football Hall of Famer Dan Marino and politician Jeb Bush, and he coordinated one of the biggest, private searches in Florida history. More than 700 people showed up, they searched the swamps around Tif-fany’s walking route, they blanketed the state with ﬂ  iers, put Tif-fany’s face on billboards, and answered the hotline.” 
But no leads emerged.
The familiar narrative of a beautiful girl gone missing in a 
small town captivated the nation, but eventually,  like so many 
homicides and abductions, Sessions’s case went “cold.” 
Wednesday, a quarter of a century later, Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce Detective Kevin Allen announced to CBS they had identiﬁ  ed a primary suspect: serial killer Paul Rowles, who died in prison early last year. 
Our hearts go out to Sessions’ family as Alachua County de-
tectives move forward in the investigation. Today, major devel-
opments in the case will be announced, though Sessions’ father 
told the Orlando Sentinel that “Rowles’ connection to Tiffany’s disappearance has existed for a few years.”
In the next few weeks, the case will be revived and played 
out over national news outlets, and CBS’s “48 Hours” will fea-ture it as its own special. 
Cases often go cold due to lack of personnel, above else: Ac-
cording to the Bureau of Justice Assistance, cold-case squads can require up to two full-time investigators researching one case, 
along with other investigators who work on outside cases, in-
terdepartmental partnerships, administrators and “light-duty” detectives. 
In addition to a simple lack of manpower to cover cold cas-
es, back then, authorities didn’t have the resources we do now. That’s why the National Institute of Justice awarded $14.2 mil-lion to 38 states in 2005 to renew “homicides, sexual assaults and other violent crimes.” In 2007, NIJ awarded $8 million to 21 state and local agencies. Since the Institute’s money allotments to lo-
cal and state cold-case teams, dozens of cases have been solved, 
and many, many more are ongoing. 
The importance of cold cases, then, is broader than the obvi-
ous need for families of victims to gain answers — or closure. When theses types of investigations uncover enormous devel-opments such as the link between Rowles and Sessions, it proves the government dollars and extra labor at work are adding up to real progress. 
As the Sessions’ case continues to unfold with the added re-
sources of DNA testing and improved digital technology, the Alligator will be there along the way to report updates and new ﬁ  ndings.Plutocracy hurts middle class, widens gap
A rising tide to lift all yachts? 
That’s what one memo from Citigroup Inc. pre-
dicted back in 2006, the third in a series outlining 
to investors the emerging plutocracy. 
Basically, a plutocracy is a society ruled by a group of 
its richest citizens. Citigroup was outlining its apparent emergence to help investors know how best to invest.  Of course, this was before the Great Recession. 
This memo advised investors not to bet on the middle 
class or consumer staples but instead to focus on services and products for the ultra wealthy. The author argued the wealthiest people in the U.S. have a disproportionate sway on the economy because of their massive wealth, backing it up with lots of data. Essentially, he’s right. 
They have a huge impact on the aggregate amounts of 
money because they have most of it.
There are two types of people in a plutocracy, accord-
ing to the memos: ”There are rich consumers, few in num-ber, but disproportionate in the gigantic slice of income and consumption they take. There are the rest, the ‘non-rich,’ the multitudinous many, but only accounting for surprisingly small bites of the national pie.”
The authors projected the plutocracy would only grow. 
Trying to maximize return, they urged investors to put money in companies serving the top one percent.
“Welcome to the plutonomy machine,” the report be-
gins. Welcome indeed.    
It doesn’t come as a surprise to hear about a plutono-
my machine today, an era where Occupy Wall Street has made economic inequality one of the most talked-about issues. 
It’s becoming clearer the invisible hand is too busy 
pleasuring the one percent to bother reaching out to the middle class when they need help more than ever. 
An article in Monday’s The New York Times shows a 
future dictated by the spending habits of the one percent. It talks about the declining revenues of restaurants like Red Lobster and Olive Garden, while more luxurious en-tities are up in proﬁ  ts year after year. While J.C. Penney share prices have fallen by more than half, Nordstrom stock has more than doubled.  So has Dollar General.
“As politicians and pundits 
in Washington continue to spar over whether economic inequal-
ity is in fact deepening, in cor-
porate America there really is no debate at all,” wrote Times reporter Nelson Schwartz. “The post-recession reality is that 
the customer base for businesses that appeal to the mid-dle class is shrinking as the top tier pulls even further away.”
So what does that mean? Citigroup was right. From 
2006, they accurately predicted how the economy is to-day. Last year, a report from The New York Times showed the top 10 percent of earners took more than half of the income. The dichotomy between Nordstrom and Dollar General makes sense — the middle class is disappearing. 
Those memos prove the ultra wealthy don’t care if the 
economy doesn’t improve. They know that the housing crash and market volatility are eroding the middle class, so they’re placing their bets elsewhere. Because they es-
sentially have their own economy at this point, our falter-
ing economy means nothing to them.
This is alarming and infuriating. The invisible hand 
isn’t coming this time. When it did, people were too busy hurting from the recession to see the already ultra wealthy came in and took it. Now, people are left struggling while the rich continue to bet on themselves, widening the in-come gap and hurting everyone below them.
Riding the gravy train is how one of those Citigroup 
memos described it.
Class warfare has hefty undertones, but the one per-
cent declared it years ago. That much is evident from those memos:
“The world is dividing into two blocs — the Plutono-
my and the rest.”

Your favorite store’s mannequins may be 
getting a makeover.
Some companies have expressed a desire 
to change the mannequin game by introduc-
ing mannequins more representative of the 
average person with fat, saggy breasts, tattoos 
and even pubic hair, the Associated Press re-ported.
David’s Bridal is also set to introduce man-
nequins with measurements that are more accurate to the average woman’s body. Plus-sized mannequins will have flab.
According to the AP, al-
though realistic mannequins 
are more expensive to pro-
duce, by giving customers a more accurate idea of how a garment will fit them, they could help bring in shop-pers who would otherwise turn to online shopping.
Most mannequins aren’t representative 
of how the clothes will actually fit — usu-
ally tucked and pinned in the back to fit the 
mold.
And yet, the use of mannequins and how 
they are styled is crucial to a store’s image.
Isamari Sochuk, the visuals manager at 
Ann Taylor in the Oaks Mall, said the store uses mannequins to style the company’s clothes in a way that is trendy and could po-tentially appeal to both young and older cus-tomers.
Mannequins with tattoos would probably 
be appealing to a younger crowd, she said.
Sochuk said although she thinks more 
realistic figures and body art could bring in customers, the store isn’t planning to update their mannequins just yet.
Audrey Miller, a 19-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology sophomore, said she feels mannequins with more realistic fea-tures would be an improvement from the ex-aggeratedly thin mannequins.
Miller said, however, she doesn’t normal-
ly take great notice to the way mannequins look.
“Honestly, mannequins kind of freak me 
out, so it doesn’t change my opinion,” she said.According to the AP report, customers do 
pay a lot of attention to mannequins. Ameri-can Apparel, known for its tendency to be controversial, noticed a 30-percent increase in the number of customers since store manne-quins with pubic hair were introduced.
Aseel Alhomsi, a UF telecommunication 
senior, said she thinks redesigning manne-quins is a positive move.
She said it shows stores are “trying to 
reach people more than the image of what people are ‘supposed’ to look like.”

� THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT OF 
STUDENTS SAID THEY HAD REBOUND SEX .
ROSIE ROBINSON
Avenue Writer
You have to get under someone 
to get over someone.
This advice often follows the 
end of a relationship, encouraging 
people to take advantage of their 
recently single status with a casual 
hookup.And although rebound sex can 
make for a good plotline in a ro-mantic comedy or an embarrass-ing anecdote your friends won’t let you forget, it hasn’t really been the subject of scientific research until now.
A recent psychological study 
found that up to one-third of col-lege students have rebound or re-venge sex within a month of end-
ing a relationship.
Psychologists from the Uni-
versity of Missouri studied 170 
undergraduate students who had gone through a breakup in the last eight months.
The students 
filled out online journals for a 10-week period about their sex-ual exploits and emotions.
T h i r t y - f i v e 
percent of the students said they’d 
had sex to get over their ex, and 25 
percent said they’d had revenge sex, according to the study, which was published in February’s issue of Archives of Sexual Behavior.
Those who were left by their 
partner were more upset and an-gry, which led them to be more likely to have sex to cope with negative emotions.
Although jumping into bed 
with someone 30 minutes after a breakup might not be a good idea, it’s still unclear whether rebound sex can really help people emo-
tionally.
Students may actually be hav-
ing greater difficulty moving on 
and starting new relationships, said Lynne Cooper, one of the psy-
chologists conducting the study.
The people who reported hav-
ing rebound or revenge sex after 
a breakup were more likely to engage in other risky sexual be-haviors like sex with strangers and having sex with lots of new people.
“I think it’s just something that 
people think will make them feel 
better,” said Emily Cooper, an 18-
year-old UF exploratory freshman, “but in the end it just makes them feel worse.”

You stare at a small zine in 
your hands with the cover con-
taining comical cartoon draw-
ings.
It’s your ticket in and your 
guide to get to know 10 drawing seniors at UF and their artwork.
WARPhaus Gallery, 534 SW 
Fourth Ave., held a reception for 
the show “Teaser: An Advanced 
Drawing Group Exhibition,” cu-
rated by Marla Rosen, a 21-year-old UF sculpture senior. The show featured one work from each student.
Each piece served as a preview 
for what the artists are working on for their solo shows, a manda-
tory requirement for all bachelor 
of ﬁ  ne arts candidates, at the end of the semester.
Johnathan McCullar, a 28-
year-old UF plant science senior, 
said he heard about the show 
from his girlfriend who used to be an art major.
“There’s a lot of stuff out here 
that’s way different than I’ve seen,” McCullar said. “A lot of techniques that I’ve never seen used in contemporary art. It’s re-ally impressive.”
Most of the artists went to the 
reception and had the chance to converse with guests.
One of the artists, 21-year-old 
UF drawing senior Rachel Bo-lusky, featured a large black and white painting of glass from her concept of abstraction through observational realism.
“I think it’s inspiring to see 
how many people are interested in everyone’s work,” Bolusky said. “Especially since it’s so di-
verse, but they all work cohesive-
ly together.”
The room was packed full with 
art and nonart majors as well as 
visitors from Gainesville’s Art 
Walk.
Nora King, 29, came to see her 
sister, Lily’s, artwork. 
She said she was never able to 
make it to any of her shows be-cause of work, but she said  she was very impressed with the 
show.
“Based on this, I would deﬁ  -
nitely go to more shows,” King 
said. “I’m excited to see every-body’s style with more pieces. 
I think it would be cool to see a 
bigger exhibit.”8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2014

Releasing his sixth album on Monday, “Benji” consists of 11 songs, and someone dies in almost all of them. Sound morbid? We promise it’s worth a listen. Mark Kozelek’s lyrics are honest and ﬁ  lled with personal stories that we can’t help but play on repeat. He takes uncomfortable — and sometimes embarrassing — confessions and makes them sound uncharacteristically soothing. Don’t take our word for it? Pitchfork gave the album a 9.2 rating.

From cast members getting 
arrested in New York City to 
promotion pages being banned 
on social media sites, an up-
and-coming ﬁ  lm has faced many challenges while ﬁ  nding its way to theaters.
“Free the Nipple” is a movie 
not only ﬁ  ghting for gender equality for women to have the right to be topless, but it 
also targets the media’s double 
standard concerning censorship.
“It’s a political and passionate 
ﬁ  lm. It’s about inspiring women to become stronger role models in 
a deep sense,” said director Lina 
Esco.
Shortly after she created a Facebook page promoting her ﬁ  lm, Esco’s page was immediately banned from the site when she posted nonsexual images of 
topless women.
Natural or not, Sarah Brown, 
a UF public relations sophomore, 
said she doesn’t think these 
images should be shown openly 
on platforms such as Facebook because it is a public forum that anyone can see — including her little sister.
On the other hand, UF 
international studies senior Jessica Highﬁ  ll said she understands where conservative people 
may come from, but the nipple 
shouldn’t hold such a sexual connotation.
“I think it’s important in the ﬁ  rst place to teach your kids that that’s a stigma society has — there’s not anything wrong with it,” Highﬁ  ll said.
Facebook has given no response 
to the ﬁ  lm as of press time. 
The argument that children 
shouldn’t be 
exposed to 
nudity is also a reason why Esco addresses the fact that media 
commends such 
absurd acts of violence on all 
platforms yet considers a woman’s nipple — part of the natural body 
— wildly obscene.
Bruce Floyd, UF’s social media 
specialist, said the controversy   
stems from cultural issues.“It could be societal pressure 
or it could be assumptions made by what our culture deems appropriate and inappropriate 
on a platform, but ultimately 
it’s up to each of the platforms themselves,” he said.
Despite the intention of 
the ﬁ  lm, the Motion Picture 
Association of America rated the 
ﬁ  lm as NC-17 for pornography, although it doesn’t feature a single sexual act.
If the rating is not changed, the 
ﬁ  lm will not be played in most theaters.
“It’s a movie about censorship, 
and we’re getting censored left 
and right,” Esco said.
She began crowd funding 
allowing her to market the ﬁ  lm 
independently and ﬁ  nd her own 
distributors.
Along the way, Esco received support from Miley Cyrus and 
the Hufﬁ  ngton Post.
Despite the obstacles Esco 
faced, Katy Burnett, the president 
of the Gainesville National 
Organization of Women, said she respects the passion, but believes there are other important ways to push for equality.   
“I think they are just young 
and maybe in the future they will see that there are so many more urgent matters of inequality than 
just being topless,” Burnett said.
Esco said she understands 
some people may view the ﬁ  lm as 
simply promoting being topless, but that’s not the case at all.
“I am not promoting 
toplessness or asking people to go topless, do whatever you want,” Esco said. “This is just a 
simple root that started the whole 
thing.”

Macklemore and Ryan Lewis  
continue to ﬁ  ght for equal rights.
This past Saturday, the rap duo 
released a public service announce-
ment as part of USA Network’s 
Characters Unite Month, an annual 
campaign to combat discrimination.
The 41-second 
announcement features the rap-per and producer alongside every-day people and “White Collar” 
star Matt Bomer,  
vowing not to stand for homopho-
bia, religious intolerance, discrimi-nation, intolerance and unequal rights.
“We intended ‘Same Love’ to 
help spread a message of love, tol-erance and acceptance and we are proud to align ourselves with the 
Characters Unite movement which 
shares the same goal,” said Mack-lemore and Lewis in a statement. “Through the new Characters Unite PSA, we hope to inspire even more people to take part in such an im-portant cause.”
The announcement follows 
Macklemore and Lewis’ rendition 
of “Same Love” being used as the 
soundtrack to the marriage of 33 gay and straight couples during the Grammy Awards on Jan. 26. 
Frederick Franco, a 20-year-old 
UF anthropology sophomore, said though he appreciated the gesture, he felt there was a better way to deal with the issues.
“It’s nice, I guess, but I don’t see 
why it’s necessary to make the cam-paign when there’s a bunch of orga-nizations doing this already,” said Franco, who identiﬁ  es as gay.
 “I think it would have been bet-
ter to do it for HRC (Human Rights Campaign), for the It Gets Better Project, rather than to start a new 
one just to put their names all over 
it,” he said.Same love, new goal

The creator of a “revenge 
porn” website was arrested Jan. 
23 — but not for maintaining the website.
Hunter Moore’s now-defunct 
website, isanyoneup.com, dis-
played nude images and videos submitted to the site by scorned ex-lovers or angry ex-boyfriends as a form of revenge.
Moore, 27, paid a friend to 
hack into girls’ email accounts 
and download their nude photos, 
which he then posted on his web-site, according to the 15-count FBI indictment.
The previous website’s user-
submitted content was perfectly legal under current Florida law, but that may soon change, said Florida Rep. Tom Goodson.
Goodson is sponsoring a bill 
that aims to criminalize the dis-tribution of “revenge porn,” re-gardless of who uploaded it. A similar bill failed to pass in Flor-ida last year due in part to Sec-tion 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which immunizes websites from defamation and privacy claims.
As a victim of revenge porn, 
CEO and founder of Cyber Civil 
Rights Initiative, Holly Jacobs, is 
doing her best to help legislators craft language that can subvert Section 230. 
Jacobs had to leave her teach-
ing job and change her name af-ter nude photos and an explicit video ended up online.
Sara Finnigan, a 22-year-old 
UF economics senior, has visited Moore’s site.
“There are some that are dis-
turbing, and there are some that are funny,” she said. “Mostly it’s interesting because some people post and they’re mad … some people are a little graphic.”
But Jacobs found nothing fun-
ny about revenge porn.
“It’s scary to go through,” the 
30-year-old said. “It’s not only completely violating and a form of sexual assault… but it also in-cites stalking and harassment.”
The video of Jacobs included 
her full name, email address, in-formation about her progress in 
a Ph.D. program and where she 
would be giving conferences, she said.
Some argue that “revenge 
porn” sites shouldn’t be crimi-nalized because the people in the images allowed their photos to be taken in the ﬁ  rst place – or took them themselves.
Connor Volpi, a 21-year-
old UF psychology junior, said he didn’t think that sites like Moore’s should be taken away because people are simply put in embarrassing situations.

Will Muschamp speaks at a press conference in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Jan. 13. The Gators signed 15 play -
ers to finish 24-member recruiting class that was ranked seventh nationally, according to Rivals.com.

Florida put the final touches 
on its 2014 recruiting class of 
24 members on National Sign-
ing Day. When the dust settled, 
the Gators ended with the No. 7 class in the country, according to Rivals.com. 
This is the third year in a row 
coach Will Muschamp has put together a top-10 class. 
One of the most notable UF 
storylines of the day came from 
Miami Booker T. Washington 
High when No. 3 dual-threat quarterback Treon Harris an-nounced he would flip on his 
verbal commitment with Florida 
State and sign his letter of intent with Florida. 
Harris took an official visit to 
Gainesville on Jan. 17 and should 
fit perfectly in new offensive co-
ordinator Kurt Roper’s up-tem-po spread offense. As a senior, Harris threw for more than 2,000 
yards and racked up 28 touch-
downs. 
Harris will join redshirt ju-
nior Jeff Driskel, redshirt sopho-more Skyler Mornhinweg and early enrollee Will Grier in the 
quarterback corps. Harris also received offers from Miami and 
Auburn.
“You want to have four quar-
terbacks on scholarship,” Mus-
champ said. “Then you want to 
sign one every year because of the attrition sometimes you go through at that position.”
Former FSU wide receiver 
commit C.J. Worton also signed his LOI to the Gators on Wednes-day. Worton decommitted from FSU last week following his of-
ficial visit to UF. 
Worton chose Florida over 
West Virginia.  
The Gators need all the help 
they can get at wide receiver. 
The 2013 offense finished the sea-son ranked 116th in the nation in passing yards per completion. Additionally, it lost leading re-
ceiver Solomon Patton to gradu-
ation. 
Another talented playmaker 
Florida welcomed is four-star 
receiver and tight end Moral Ste-
phens, the No. 27 receiver in the 2014 class. 
Stephens will likely be used at 
the slot position or at tight end. 
In addition, tight ends Deandre 
Goolsby and C’yontai Lewis look to revamp the position, which UF wraps up 2014 class with 15 signees on National Signing Day

Adoree’ Jackson pulled out a box.
The five-star cornerback and wide 
receiver from Gardena, Calif., was about to decide where he would spend the next three to five years of his foot-
ball career. In the immortal words of 
LeBron James, 
he was deciding where he would “take his talents to.”
The top contenders were local 
Southern California, a team with three head coaches in the past year, and Flor-
ida, fresh off its worst season in Jack-
son’s lifetime.
As friends, family, reporters and 
coaches alike looked on from either the room at Juniperro Serra High or on television screens, Jackson began removing items.
First, a Gatorade bottle. Surely, that 
meant Jackson was Gainesville bound.Rings and a hat followed, then a 
cleat — colored orange and blue. In a second, he’d be a Gator.
But Jackson pulled out a Trojans hat 
and committed to USC.
Missing out on Rivals.com’s No. 6 
prospect in the country put a disap-pointing cap on what was otherwise a successful signing day for Florida.
“Most of the time, you know (who 
you are going to sign),” coach Will Muschamp said. “You know if you’re getting them and you know if you’re not. 
“If you haven’t talked to him in 
48 hours, you’re not getting him … If you’re on the phone that morning with mom and dad and brother and uncle, you’re probably going to sign him.”
Jackson would have been the cherry 
on Florida’s sundae, but instead the Gators will have to settle for just ice cream — which most would agree is good as well. UF signed 15 players on Gators improve secondary

Cody Riggs will complete his college ca-
reer elsewhere.
Riggs will graduate from UF after the 
spring semester and transfer to another school 
in May to play out his final year of eligibility, coach Will Muschamp said Wednesday. The redshirt junior safety and his parents recently 
approached the Florida coach about the deci-
sion to leave.
“(He) wanted a fresh start,” Muschamp 
said, “and I appreciate his contributions to Florida.”
Riggs wants to return to playing at cor-
nerback, a position he played during his first three years at UF and at Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas High, according to a 
Gainesville Sun report.
During Florida’s 4-8 season in 2013, Riggs 
started all 12 games at safety and was fourth 
on the team with 51 tackles, including 6.5 for a loss of 35 yards. The 5-foot-9, 190-pound Riggs went without an interception but 
notched 1.5 sacks and three pass breakups 
last year, a season after redshirting 2012 with a fracture in his foot.
In wins against Arkan-
sas and Toledo last season, 
Riggs led the team with six 
tackles in each game. 
He leaves his Florida ca-
reer with 107 tackles, two 
sacks, a forced fumble and 
an interception in 40 games played — 26 of them starts.
With Riggs transferring and Jaylen Wat-
kins — last year’s starter opposite Riggs at 
safety — graduating, Muschamp sees senior 
Jabari Gorman, redshirt sophomore Mar-cus Maye, sophomore Keanu Neal, redshirt freshmen Marcell Harris, Nick Washington 
and freshman Duke Dawson as candidates Riggs to transfer following 
graduation to play cornerback

lacked production last season.
“I think [tight end] was a very offensive position 
when Jordan Reed was here,” Muschamp said. “It was 
an offensive position last year.”
However, Florida missed on a couple five-star 
targets Wednesday. The No. 2 offensive tackle in the 
2014 class, Damian Prince, chose to stay home and 
sign with Maryland. Prince’s hometown of Forestville, 
Md., is just 20 minutes outside of College Park. 
The No. 9 overall recruit in the 2014 class, Adoree’ 
Jackson, from Gardena, Calif., also chose to stay close to home, signing with USC. 
UF was considered a favorite to sign Jackson be-
cause of his desire to pursue a track career while in college, but he decided to sign with the Trojans. 
Jackson is primarily a cornerback, a position that 
is full at UF with Vernon Hargreaves III and early en-rollee Jalen Tabor on campus. Four-star cornerbacks Quincy Wilson and J.C. Jackson also signed with UF on Wednesday, and three-star athlete Deiondre Por-ter will play corner, Muschamp announced during his National Signing Day press conference. 
“We think (Porter) will project very well to the de-
fensive back position,” Muschamp said.
Florida needed to build depth along the offensive 
line, and it did just that Wednesday. The 2014 class 
has six offensive linemen, including four-star offen-
sive tackle David Sharpe, a Jacksonville native. 
Included in the class is JUCO transfer Drew Sar-
vary. Both players are talented enough to see playing time during the 2014 season. 
Florida signed explosive playmakers along the de-
fensive line, with four-star defensive tackle Thomas Holley and defensive end Gerald Willis leading the group. Defensive tackle Khairi Clark and end Justus 
Reed are also big pickups. 
“Those guys will be given every opportunity to 
step in and help us,” Muschamp said.for the two open starting roles at 
safety.
Harris (knee) and Washington 
(shoulder), both freshmen in 2013, 
decided to redshirt after suffer-
ing their respective injuries. Mus-champ envisions Dawson, Wash-ington and Poole as players who could play multiple positions in 
the secondary, including nickel.
Injury update: Running back 
Matt Jones (torn meniscus) under-
went a second surgery on his knee 
Wednesday.
Jones’ left knee is “90 percent 
healed,” according to Muschamp. 
The then-sophomore suffered 
the season-ending injury during Florida’s 17-6 loss to LSU on Oct. 
12, 2013 — UF’s fifth contest of the 2013 season. 
Muschamp does not expect 
Jones to participate in spring prac-tices.
“They (the team doctors) feel 
very comfortable that it’s way further along than they thought it 
would be at this time and feel re-ally good about him progressing 
well,” Muschamp said. 
“He still won’t go through 
spring.” 
Linebackers Matt Rolin (torn 
ACL), Jeremi Powell (torn ACL) and Alex Anzalone (shoulder) will 
not practice during spring activi-
ties.
Peterson added to staff: Former 
NFL and UF linebacker Mike Pe-terson will join the Gators in a full-
time position in the weight room 
starting Feb. 24. 
Peterson was an undergradu-
ate assistant for Florida in the fall 
while he worked toward earning 
his college degree. During his foot-ball career, he competed at Florida from 1995-98 and played 14 years in the NFL.
“We looked around in the 
coaching ranks, and we had an opportunity in the weight room, and to be able to hire a guy like 
that, former Gator, knows how it’s 
going to be done the right way,” Muschamp said. 
“That’s invaluable for our play-
ers.  So great to have him on staff.”THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Matt Jones tries breaking a tackle during Florida’s 17-6 loss to LSU on Oct. 12, 2013, at Tiger Stadium in 
Baton Rouge, La. Jones had a second surgery on his torn left meniscus on Wednesday. Coach Will Muschamp said the junior will miss spring practice. He rushed for 339 yards in five games before suffering the injury.

Foot , from page 14
Signing , from page 14Florida misses out 
on top-10 athleteUF signed five defensive backs in class
Wednesday to complete its 24-mem-
ber recruiting class.
Despite missing out on Jackson, 
the Gators brought in four defen-sive backs to restore their depleted 
secondary. Florida lost Loucheiz 
Purifoy and Marcus Roberson to the NFL Draft, Jaylen Watkins to gradua-tion and, as Muschamp confirmed on Wednesday, Cody Riggs to transfer. 
“We felt like we needed to con-
tinue some length at the corner posi-tion especially, and sign those guys,” Muschamp said. 
“So we were able to get that.  That 
was very pleasing.”
In addition to Duke Dawson and 
Jalen Tabor, who enrolled early, UF signed J.C. Jackson, Quincy Wilson and Deiondre Porter on Wednesday.
J.C. Jackson and Wilson’s recruit-
ments could not have been more opposite. J.C. Jackson was rumored 
to flip for weeks and was linked to 
Florida State, where former Gators commit Dalvin Cook had already committed and Ermon Lane had been linked to. Lane signed with the Semi-noles on Wednesday.
Instead, J.C. Jackson stuck with 
the Gators.
“I know he looked at some other 
places, no different than a lot of kids do, and I encourage kids to do, to go make sure they’re making the right decision,” Muschamp said. “We nev-er felt it was that much in the balance, maybe as what a lot of people seemed 
to think.”
Wilson, on the other hand, was as 
solid as a rock. The Fort Lauderdale 
native actively campaigned for other recruits to join him in committing to Florida, lobbying them on Twitter throughout the recruiting process.
“These guys want to play with 
each other,” Muschamp said. “They 
want good players.  They want to play with each other.  So there’s no question that the camaraderie they 
build helps us or other schools if they’re going with the other schools.  
But certainly, he did a fantastic job of 
holding some guys together.”

Freshmen have had success for Florida in 
recent years.
In 2011, pitcher Hannah Rogers won 36 
games and struck out 221 batters, which were 
the third- and eighth-highest single-season to-tals, respectively, at that time. 
In 2012, utility player Sami Fagan tied for 
a team-high 71 hits with then-senior Michelle Moultrie and posted a .378 batting average in her sole year at Florida. Lauren Haeger, also a freshman in 2012, led the team with 14 home runs and 52 RBIs while notching 129 strike-
outs en route to a 15-5 record in the pitching 
circle.
But in 2013, a year when Florida was sup-
posed to slump due to Sami Fagan, Kasey 
Fagan and Cheyenne Coyle transferring from 
the team, Kelsey Stewart jumped into UF’s re-cord books in more ways than one during her freshman campaign.
The Wichita, Kan., native, who was the No. 
2 recruit on ESPN’s 2012 top-100 list while playing at Maize High, led UF with a .378 bat-ting average, tying Fagan’s freshman average in 50 more at-bats.
Stewart also set school records for triples 
(10), stolen bases (36) and stolen-base attempts 
(39) in a season while also cracking the top-10 
in four other single season categories — high-
est stolen base percentage (T7th, .923), most at-bats (4th, 238), most runs scored (T6th, 62) and most hits (2nd, 90).
Coach Tim Walton anticipated Stewart’s 
stellar performance.
“Maybe some of the power numbers might 
have surprised us a little just given what she 
does, but we expected her to be an instrumen-tal part of the team,” Walton said. “I recruited her to be a leadoff hitter, recruited her to play 
second base, so all of the things she did wasn’t too surprising.”
During Florida’s 15-game winning streak 
to start the season, which included wins against No. 5 Oregon, No. 3 California and No. 13 Arizona, Stewart accrued a .455 batting average and 13 RBIs while scoring 18 runs of her own.
“Just working hard and not really having 
expectations for myself, I think that helped a lot,” Stewart said.Added Walton: “She came out on complete 
ﬁ  re to start off the season last year. She was one of the big reasons why we were able to win so many games when maybe we could’ve lost easily in the last couple innings.”
Her high level of performance continued 
into Southeastern Conference play. In 24 games against SEC opponents, Stewart led Florida with a .358 batting average, 29 hits and 18 runs, leading to second team All-SEC 
and All-Freshman team accolades.
Stewart already has plans for improving 
this season, which starts tonight when No. 4 Florida faces off against No. 25 South Florida in Tampa at 6.
“This year, I think I’ve grown up and have 
expectations for myself because I just think 
that will make me better,” she said.
Stewart, who was named to the preseason 
All-SEC team on Monday and ESPNW’s pre-season All-American team on Wednesday, said she has been working on improving on her soft game and her ball placement.
“I’m more of a power-slapper, so I hit the 
ball in front of people,” she said.
“Me and coach have been in the cages so 
much this year, but I think just being better 
at my weaknesses and making my strengths 
stronger will help.”
Defensively, Stewart believes that the in-
ﬁ  eld can only get better from last season be-cause all of its other starters — third baseman 
Stephanie Tofft, shortstop Katie Medina, ﬁ  rst 
baseman Taylor Schwarz and catchers Au-bree Munro and Taylore Fuller — are still on the team.
“We just look at each other and it’s a way 
of communicating,” Stewart said. 
“We don’t really have to talk to each other 
to get our point across. We know each other’s’ moves. Like, if I know Taylor Schwarz isn’t go-
ing to get two steps to her right, I know I have 
to be there. It’s just little things like that.”
Tofft, the only player other than Stewart to 
start in all 67 games for Florida in 2013, was 
impressed by her performance.
“I think she started off great as a fresh-
man,” Tofft said.
 “As the season went on, I think she got 
more and more used to the college atmo-sphere, but honestly she came in mentally and 
physically ready for college softball.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2014
