Fourteen months ago, Jacoby 
Brissett stood near midcourt inside the Palm Beach Gardens 
Dwyer High gymnasium, fighting back the bashful smile he is quickly becoming known for.
The 6-foot-3, 229-pound, two-sport 
star was no more than two hours re-moved from the biggest decision of his life, yet he stood confidently as he was surrounded by more than a doz-en reporters and cameramen. Like college coaches vying for his national letter of intent, the re-porters were competing to get their questions in to Brissett. They wanted to know about his decision to orally commit to Florida, even against the wishes of his mother, Lisa Brown, who wanted him to go to Miami.
Although he was the No. 3 dual-
threat quarterback prospect in the nation, according to Rivals.com, and some of his closest friends, like safety Matt Elam, were already playing in Gainesville, Brissett’s commitment to the Gators was a curious one. 
The public announcement came 
two days after National Signing Day, and less than a month after Jeff Driskel, the No. 1 pro-style quarter-back in the class of 2011 and the top overall quarterback prospect in the nation, enrolled early for classes on Florida’s campus.
“I just wanted competition,” Bris-
sett said last month. “He was the No. 1 quarterback and it so happened that I was — I had got an offer from Flor-ida toward the end of the year and I just took it.”
Brissett’s commitment put Flor-
ida in a unique position. The Gators signed two of the top quarterback prospects in the nation, marking the first time one school has landed two of the top five signal-callers in a sin-
gle class since Rivals began ranking 
recruits in 2002. 
Driskel’s presence at UF didn’t 
faze Brissett or make him question his decision. It motivated him.
“He’s just got to show me he’s bet-
ter than me. That’s all it is,” Brissett said that night. “He’ll have to prove to me every day, every year that he’s going to be better than me for him to win that starting job.”  
When Driskel arrived in 
Gainesville from Oviedo — a suburb of Orlando roughly 20 minutes from downtown — he was accompanied by considerable expectations and un-fair comparisons.
His size and mobility invoked vi-
sions of former Heisman winner and two-time BCS national champion Tim Tebow, whose college career was still fresh in the minds of Florida fans.
Thanks to a stellar career at Oviedo 
Hagerty High, coupled with the No. 
1 quarterback ranking and John Brantley’s sub-par, nine-touchdown, 10-interception season in 2010, many expected Driskel to compete with Brantley for the starting job immediately.
At the time, Brissett wasn’t even 
on the Gators’ radar; they seemed perfectly content with Driskel’s com-mitment.
Former Florida coach Urban 
Meyer offered Brissett a grayshirt — a chance to enroll later and not lose a year of eligibility while sitting out his first year — but did not recruit him otherwise, according to Brissett’s mother.
Following Driskel’s 507-yard, 
five-touchdown performance in his final high school game — a 56-35 loss to Lakeland High in Hagerty’s first-ever playoff game — his coach, Nate Gierke, called him the best high school player he has ever seen, a state-ment he still stands by today.
If anyone could meet the expec-
tations at Florida, Gierke added, it would be Driskel.
But that was much easier said than 
done.
Driskel was Brantley’s backup 
during the spring, but the freshman struggled adjusting to the college game, something Gierke said was to be expected for any freshman, even the all-time greats.
“I had no idea what I was doing,” Driskel recalled. “(I was) kind of just throwing the ball around.”
While Driskel struggled during his 
first semester in Gainesville, Brissett, who was recruited hard by former of-fensive coordinator Charlie Weis dur-ing the last month before National Signing Day, drove up to Gainesville during the weekends in the spring.
He would watch practices — the 
same practices where Driskel strug-gled — and sit and talk with players and coaches. Knowing that he would be at a disadvantage coming in a se-mester later than Driskel, Brissett studied the offense and picked up intricacies of it from former Dwyer teammates Gerald Christian and Rob-ert Clark, both of whom have since transferred from Florida.
By the time Brissett enrolled in the 
summer, he was focused on catching up to Driskel.
“I don’t really do nothing outside 
of school and football,” Brissett said. “I really just concentrated on that.”
Despite Brissett’s attempt to catch 
him during the summer and fall camp, Driskel entered the year No. 2 on Florida’s depth chart. Driskel saw time in mop-up duty early in the sea-son, but was thrust into his first real action when Brantley sprained his ankle just before halftime of the Ala-bama game on Oct. 1, Florida’s fifth game of the year.
The situation was a familiar one 
for Driskel, who Gierke said was “thrown into the fire” three games into his freshman season at Hagerty — the first season the Huskies fielded a varsity team. Like the scenario in 2007, when the rest of Driskel’s team was adjusting to a new game, the 2011 incarnation of the Gators was adjust-ing to a new scheme under a first-year coaching staff.
“He was able to draw on that ex-
perience some,” Gierke said. “But it’s apples and oranges when you com-pare the level of competition he was facing.”
Gierke was right: The situations 
were similar in theory, but exponen-tially different in reality. 
Despite the experience his fresh-
man year at Hagerty, Driskel was ad-mittedly nervous against the Tide and looked shell-shocked. In the second half of the 38-10 loss, the Gators were held to just 61 yards and no points.
“High school and Florida, and 
playing against the No. 1 team at the time — it doesn’t compare,” Driskel said of his 2-for-6, 14-yard perfor-mance. “It’s not even close. There’s guys that are 260 pounds out there running 4.5s, so I mean, that kinda sums it up.”
The following week against LSU, 
Brissett started with Brantley out and Driskel also reportedly nursing a sprained ankle.
When Brantley finally returned 
against Georgia, Brissett remained the backup, leaving Driskel waiting in the wings for the remainder of the season.
“He was frustrated,” said Gierke, 
who still talks to Driskel regularly. “He’s always played and he’s always been the guy that everybody looks to to make the play, no matter what sport he played. … Nobody is ever content being the backup at anything.”
  Brissett chose Florida because 
he wanted to compete for the job — something neither he nor Driskel re-ally had to deal with in high school.
This spring, the two are doing just 
that. 
Since the start of practice last 
month, coach Will Muschamp and of-fensive coordinator Brent Pease have stressed that it’s an open competition for the starting role between the two sophomores, and Muschamp said this week it’s evident the battle will continue into fall camp.
“We all know it’s a competition,” 
Brissett said. “That’s what we came to Florida for, for a competition.”
By all accounts, the two have 
evenly split snaps in practice, as Mus-champ said they would. But so, too, have the other quarterbacks on the roster.
Florida long has been cautious 
about what information leaks to the public, and this spring’s quarterback competition has been no different. Neither quarterback would disclose who took the first snap of spring prac-tice, though Quinton Dunbar eventu-ally divulged that it was Driskel. 
Ask any teammate a question 
about the two sophomores — even something as mundane as “what does each do differently?” — and they all are tight-lipped, simply saying both quarterbacks are stepping up as lead-ers and looking great.
Muschamp said he is looking for 
“positive production” from both, and as he stands just yards behind each offensive huddle during practice, he has been paying attention to how the rest of the offensive players respond to Driskel and Brissett’s respective demeanors. 
So far, Muschamp said, he has 
been pleased with what he has seen from both. Still, neither has created separation in the coaches’ eyes.
In spite of the intense competition, 
Driskel and Brissett insist they are close off the field, with Brissett jok-ing that the two “go on walks on the weekends.”
“Right now we’re good friends 
and I think it’s gonna stay like that,” Driskel said. “Coach Muschamp’s not going to let [the competition] get out of control, and he’s not going to toler-ate that.”
Regardless of the friendship, the 
two are still battling for the coveted starting job under center. Saturday’s Orange & Blue Debut will be just one of the many opportunities the two have to create separation, and when the dust eventually settles, one will have won the job and the other will have lost it.
Muschamp said he wouldn’t rule 
out using a two-quarterback system, but as the saying goes: When you have two quarterbacks, you really don’t have one.
Brissett was reminded last month 
of what he said about Driskel the night he orally committed to the Gators. He looked up from a table within the confines of the visiting locker room in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, knowingly nodded and once again flashed that bashful smile.
“I did (say that),” Brissett said. 
“He still has to prove that he’s better than me, because it won’t stop.”

Jordan Agrippe, a 21-year-old psychology senior, and Robert Bolduc, a 22-year-old criminology senior, light candles at the Keep Hope Alive suicide awareness vigil Thursday evening. Eighty-ﬁ  ve candles were lit in remembrance of people who commit suicide every day.

On the ninth anniversary of 
her son’s suicide, Judy Broward 
tried explain to UF students the tragedy that once seemed sense-less to her.
“If I had known then what I 
know now, I would have done so many different things,” she told an audience of about 100 students Thursday night at the Reitz Am-phitheater.
Broward was part of a suicide 
perspective panel at Keep Hope Alive, a suicide awareness forum and vigil.
A group of students from UF’s 
Psychology of Suicide Class host-ed the event, which featured the ﬁ  ve-person panel, performances and a candlelight remembrance vigil. UF’s Counseling and Well-ness Center, the Alachua County Crisis Center, Aware, To Write Love On Her Arms and UF Psy-chology Club co-sponsored the event.
Meggen Sixbey, assistant co-
ordinator of emergency and cri-sis response services with the UF Counseling and Wellness Center, referenced a study that showed 10 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds con-sidered suicide in the last year.
It also showed that 1.4 percent 
attempted it.
“At our campus, that’s about 
700 people,” Sixbey said.
This once included Lindsey 
Dhans, a 27-year-old occupational therapy graduate student who said she attempted suicide once in high school and again as a college freshman. Dhans said she had struggled with talking about her emotions.
She was glad students were 
trying to remove the stigma of talking about suicide.
“You have 100 people that 
were here and just heard the word suicide over and over again,” she said. “They’re going to tell some-one.”Panel discusses suicide awareness, prevention

When reserving an outside table for two 
in Gainesville, your plus one could be your 
dog.
The Gainesville City Commission may 
change a city law to allow dogs to sit with their owners at outdoor tables at restau-rants.
Under the change, restaurants will need 
to apply for a permit from the city to allow dogs in the outside area.
Pet dogs are still not allowed inside 
restaurants, according to the ordinance change.
Commissioners referred the issue to city 
staff at Thursday’s meeting, moving the item toward approval.
The Warehouse Restaurant and Lounge 
Manager Ryan Premdas brought the issue of outdoor “doggie dining” to the commis-sion’s attention during a City Commission meeting in May.Taylor Bauer, a 25-year-old adoption 
counselor for the Alachua County Humane Society , said the ordinance could beneﬁ  t both dogs and their owners.
Dogs would be able to get out of the 
house while owners enjoy a meal with their companions, she said.
“They enjoy outings just as much as hu-
mans,” she said.
Israel Mendez, ofﬁ  ce manager for The 
Swamp Restaurant, said he doesn’t have a problem with having dogs in the restau-rant’s outdoor area if the ordinance change passes.
“This town and the students are a big 
pet community,” he said. “I don’t see any-thing wrong as long as people contain their dogs.”City may allow dogs to dine 
with owners at restaurantsON CAMPUS

When Dounia Bendris finishes her 
late-night work at the UF Fine Arts stu-
dio, she would like to call Student Night-time Auxiliary Patrol for a ride home. But since she’s in a wheelchair, SNAP can’t give her a lift.
Soon, she and other disabled students 
will be able to receive UF-sponsored rides after 11 p.m. and on the week-ends.
UF will soon start a transportation ser-
vice to provide students in wheelchairs like Bendris rides on campus between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. and on weekends.
The service could be available as soon 
as Summer B or fall semester, said Uni-versity Police Capt. Jeff Holcomb.
“We are looking at finding the small-
est handicap-accessible vehicle that can provide this service for an on-call need,” Holcomb said.SNAP vans aren’t wheelchair acces-
sible. Gator Lift, a free shuttle for UF students, faculty and staff with mobil-ity-related disabilities, stops running at 11 p.m. and doesn’t run at all during weekends.
“This has never been an issue for us 
previously,” said Scott Fox, director of UF’s Transportation and Parking Services. “We obviously need to re-spond to the request.”
Bendris, a 19-year-
old fine arts sopho-more, said she spends 
most nights in her studio, usually trav-eling home alone after 11 p.m. She wrote a letter to the Student Senate about how unsafe she felt going home late at night.  
Student senators met with Holcomb 
last month to present the idea of provid-ing a transportation system for disabled SNAP rides may soon be 
handicap-accessible

Zot L. Szurgot allegedly 
walked out of her house naked, 
turned to five of her neighbors and started wagging her penis.
Szurgot, a 52-year-old trans-
gender man who identifies as both a man and a woman, was arrested Wednesday by the Ala-chua County Sheriff’s Office for indecent exposure and lewd be-havior.
Szurgot lives at 220 SE 73rd 
Trail.
Of the five people who saw 
Szurgot’s sexual equipment, one was a 10-year-old boy. Another was his 4-year-old sister. 
Szurgot stood about 100 feet 
from her neighbors, an arrest re-port states, completely nude.
The boy told officers “the 
man was naked and shook his wee-wee at me.”
The children’s mother said 
she wanted to press charges, as did another adult who said he saw more of Szurgot than he preferred, according to police.On her Facebook page, Szur -
got cites Occupy Gainesville as her employer. 
She has been quoted in mul-
tiple Alligator articles about the movement. 
In the past, confusion has 
surrounded Szurgot’s gender — she lists herself as a female on Facebook, and at least one Alli-gator article has quoted Szurgot as a woman.
According to 
the First King-dom Church 
of Asphodel’s website, “Zot Lynn Szurgot is one of those magical people living between 
genders; born and raised a boy, she lives part of eir [sic] life as a masculine union-supporting electrician and part as a femi-nine spiritual being.”
On Wednesday afternoon, she 
fell under the former category.

UF employees and students who own staff 
commuter decals or green decals will have dif-
ferent parking options starting May 1.
The biggest change will be that Garage 7 at 
the Stephen C. O’Connell Center will no longer permit staff commuter decal parking, said Scott Fox, director of UF’s Transportation and Park-ing Services. 
This should relieve the current shortage of 
green decal parking, he said.
Green decal areas were always intended pri-
marily for graduate and professional students, Fox said. But previously, employees with staff commuter decals could park in all green-only areas as well.
For years, the staff commuter decal has been 
a less-expensive option for employees. Starting May 1, the annual decal will cost $156. Because more employees have bought them, green lots have recently been overflowing, especially when the O’Connell Center hosts events.
This trend reached its tipping point in Janu-
ary, Fox said. Parking services reviewed the ve-hicles in the O’Connell Center garage and found that 37 percent had staff commuter decals.
A similar situation was happening near the 
Health Science Center.
“It was never intended to be that way,” Fox 
said. “On the academic side, we’re here for stu-dents. We’re correcting an imbalance.”
Fox said he thinks some employees will buy 
the yearlong $312 orange decals.
UF’s Other Personnel Services employees are 
not eligible for an upgrade and will be incon-venienced the most by these changes, he said. Parking services is considering accommodations for them.
“The good news for students is their green 
parking should become more available,” Fox said. “The news for employees is that they will either have to park further away or upgrade to a more expensive decal.”
Faculty Senate Chairman Scott Nygren said 
he hasn’t heard any reaction from UF staff mem-bers, but that might be because the changes were just announced. They might respond when the changes actually go into effect, he said, but it’s hard to predict. Some faculty members are used to parking in certain spots and can get upset when they discover they have to do something else.
“This is something that routinely happens,” 
Nygren said.
Contact Julia Glum at jglum@alligator.org.Decal changes could upset faculty
szurgot
The changes, according to an email 
from uF Transportation and p arking 
services, include:
- Staff commuter decal parking will not be al-
lowed in Garage 7 at the O’Connell Center.
- Seventy-two green parking spaces will con-
vert to orange at the northwest corner of the 
O’Connell Center surface lot.
- Levels five and six of Garage 13 at Trans-
portation and Parking Services will change from green parking to blue parking.
- The rooftop level of Garage 9 south of Ar -
cher Road will switch from blue parking to green parking.students. The Senate will soon offer a bill to 
extend the SNAP coverage area and to pro-vide a wheelchair-accessible pickup service.  
There’s no way to make SNAP vans 
wheelchair-accessible, and SNAP drivers would require commercial driver’s licenses with passenger endorsements and special training for handling wheelchairs.
Gator Lift’s drivers already have these 
license endorsements, so extending Gator Lift’s hours and providing service on week-ends was also considered, Scott said.
“We’re committed to figuring out how to 
do it,” he said.
Now, Holcomb said the most feasible op-
tion is to have a police officer drive a smaller van with a lift system.
The new vehicle would probably cost 
about $15,000 to $25,000, he said.
Disabled students would call for a free 
ride, just like other students do for SNAP .
Until the new service is available, dis-
abled students can call for a police escort at any time.
“The Student Senate spearheaded the ef-
fort to provide disabled students a way to get home that late at night,” he said. “We may not realize the demand that’s out there.”RACHEL CROSBY

Mark Dykes isn’t scared of bees.
The 35-year-old research technician 
and apiary manager gently lifted a tray from a hive at the UF Bee Biology Re-search Unit on a recent afternoon. 
His face lit up as bees wriggled 
around on the honeycomb, buzzing dangerously close to his exposed skin.
According to James Ellis, assistant 
professor of entomology, bee colony populations are peaking in strength two to three weeks earlier than usual this year. Bee populations directly correlate to 
the amount of vector-pollinated plants blooming in the area, which need ani-mals like bees to pollinate them.
“As pollen and nectar-rich plants 
become increasingly available, bee col-onies grow at a more rapid rate,” Ellis said.
Mark Whitten, senior biologist at the 
Florida Museum of Natural History, said plants are blooming two to three weeks early this year.
“It’s not a typical spring by any 
means,” he said.
Honey bee populations usually peak 
at around mid-April to the end of May. Ellis said the peak can be attribut-
ed to the recent warm weather in the Gainesville area.
“Spring is in bloom,” Ellis said. 
“They’re peaking early but not abnor -
mally.”
With bee populations becoming ac-
tive earlier in the year, students should be aware of the stinging insects.
“Sometimes stings can be pretty mi-
nor,” said Dr. Phillip Barkley, director of the Student Health Care Center. 
Barkley said if you get stung, re-
move the stinger and apply ice to man-age the redness. 
He suggested taking Benadryl to re-
duce possible itchiness.
At the apiary, Dykes softly smoked

For some UF students, the next 
few days are just like any other 
weekend.
Seven of 27 students interviewed 
by the Alligator said they had reli-gious weekend plans. The others either made no plans or were not observing any religious holidays.
Five of the seven said they plan 
to attend Catholic Mass at St. Au-gustine Church.
Nahil Carranza, a 19-year-old 
psychology freshman and nonprac-ticing Catholic, is simply going to a Saturday Easter egg hunt.But Kateria Wynn, a 19-year-old 
advertising freshman, is attending an on-campus Easter celebration at the Curtis M. Phillips Center. Spirit of Faith Christian Center is hosting the event.
She heard the 11 a.m. service 
will packed.
At 8 p.m., Gator Wesley will 
host a Tenebrae service, in which the campus minister will read pas-sages from the Gospel of John and blow out a candle after each read-ing.
Hillel, a Jewish campus organi-
zation, is hosting two Seders, the first two Passover feasts, on Friday at 8:30 p.m. and Saturday at 9 p.m. 
Student entries cost $10, but ac-
cording to the website, reservations must be sent to blair@ufhillel.org.Different ways to spend

In the bustling classrooms inside the Nadine 
McGuire Theatre and Dance Pavilion, dance stu-
dents stretch their muscles, perfect choreography and find life-changing inspiration in a class of Par -
kinson’s disease patients.
Students who volunteer with Dance For Life, a 
class that helps Parkinson’s patients improve their movement and coordination, have found the true beneficiaries of the class are themselves.
Many alumni of Dance For Life venture into the 
field of dance in health care because of the experi-ence.
Julie Brannen, a UF alumna pursuing a master’s 
degree in dance/movement therapy and counsel-ing at Columbia College, has been involved with the class since its inception in Spring 2009. 
Brannen said it was amazing to see the Parkin-
son’s patients’ progression of being comfortable with movement and initiating their own movement even while they’re in pain.
Unlike physical therapy, dance movement thera-
py focuses on psychological recovery through move-ment, Brannen said.For most participants, however, it’s the relation-
ships that make the class an unforgettable experi-ence.
Lindsay Head, a 20-year-old dance sophomore 
who volunteered last fall, said a special moment for her was seeing the effect her touch had on a patient. Head was surprised to find that the tremors in her partner’s hand would cease under her touch during an activity in class.
The sense of belonging to a group, the physical 
activity and the interaction with a different genera-tion has been proven to help alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson’s, said Irene Malaty, assistant professor in UF’s Department of Neurology and medical di-rector of the National Parkinson Foundation Center for Excellence at UF.
As Dance For Life wraps up this semester, the 
patients prepare for their final performance at the Spring BFA Dance Showcase on April 14. But apart from the chance to perform, every person in the class gains something.
“It totally let me see how dance and movement 
can be healing in people’s lives, and it’s definitely led me down the path of, ‘Hey, I can do this for a liv-ing,’” Brannen said. “It’s an amazing career.”Dance class proves therapeutic

Does President Obama understand the Constitution?
When I heard President Obama say it would be 
“an unprecedented, extraordinary step” for the Su-
preme Court to overturn the health care reform law, often 
referred to as Obamacare, I was dumbfounded.
Of all people, the president of the United States should 
understand our government setup and the precedent of judicial review established by Marbury v. Madison — the ruling that established the authority of the Supreme Court to invalidate acts of the executive and legislative branches by deeming them unconstitutional.
Moreover, the president should understand that our 
Constitution was written to prevent tyranny of the majority. Even if legislation were passed unanimously by both cham-bers of Congress, that legislation could still be unconstitu-tional, meaning the Supreme Court could still invalidate the unanimously passed legislation.
On Monday, President Obama also drew a sharp con-
trast between the “democratically elected Congress” and the nine appointed Supreme Court justices.
Yes, the Supreme Court is not elected, but anyone with 
reasoning skills would understand that having an unelect-ed judiciary helps insulate the court from partisanship and reelection concerns.
President Obama’s troubling statement on Monday is 
part of a much larger conversation: the assault on the Con-stitution.
The assault on the Constitution has been disguised by 
claiming the Constitution is a living, breathing document. Some say that because the Constitution was written hun-dreds of years ago it must be interpreted more loosely to fit the times.
What they don’t get is what the founders understood so 
well: People were meant to be free, and because men aren’t angels, there should be some government to protect the people. The founders also understood that having a gov-ernment poses problems.
To prevent these problems, the founders drafted up a 
contract saying exactly what the government could do, stip-ulating that if the contract didn’t state the government could ex-pressly do something, then the government was forbidden from doing so.
That contract is the Constitu-
tion — the document that affects our daily lives, providing for my freedom to write this opinion and your freedom to practice what-
ever religion you choose.
Saying the Constitution is a living document would be 
like deciding your lease doesn’t really “fit the times” so you can break portions of your lease and house an elephant in your room.
Those in the living, breathing Constitution camp have 
twisted the Constitution in every direction. The scary part is that it isn’t one side but both sides. They’ll use the Com-merce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment to incorpo-rate everything.
The most recent snub of the Constitution is Obamac-
are. Clearly, the government does not have the authority to force us to purchase a product, namely health insurance, but of course the administration is invoking the Commerce Clause to justify bigger government.
We have been tricked to believe that our government 
must become centralized to compete with the globalizing world, and that’s a fallacy. When the government gets in-volved, it must tax, which hurts businesses and puts people out of work. To take care of the unemployed, the govern-ment justifies more taxes, which puts more people out of work and creates a never-ending cycle.
Washington understands that if you trample the Consti-
tution, you get bigger government, and if you want bigger government, trample the Constitution. Bigger government is not the solution; it is the problem.
We must be more true to the Constitution.Chris Ceresa is a math and classics junior at UF. His column

Students should resolve issues with 
professors instead of cheating
The column written by Chip Skambis for 
Monday’s issue of the Alligator presents an ir -
responsible solution to a difficult situation.
Cheating is morally wrong and shows a 
lack of respect for everyone involved. Not to 
mention that it is a criminal act in many cases.
By cheating, students are telling instruc-
tors that their time and energy is worthless. By cheating, students are telling the people from whom they cheat that their effort and creativ-ity in generating the work is meaningless. By cheating, students are disrespecting their fel-low students, many of whom are working hard and still might be struggling to earn good scores, only to have the A’s go to dishonest classmates. 
Lastly , cheating shows a lack of respect for 
the student’s own talents and abilities.
Skambis states that cheating is the only re-
course a student has against what he considers to be a poor, unfair, disregarding, biased and morally superior instructor. There are many ways in which a student may seek redress for legitimate complaints about their instructors.
First, talk to the instructor. Despite Skam-
bis’ ranting, most instructors wish to be fair in their dealing with students. However, if this is not satisfactory , there is a whole chain of command available to the student. Next up, the department chair, followed by the college office. Finally , the Dean of Students office can offer any number of options for disgruntled students.
Perhaps the most important action a stu-
dent can make is to do a little research. Every instructor at UF has detailed evaluations avail-able online for almost anyone to access. Read up on the instructor before taking a class. If the instructor does not have good evaluations, maybe you should adjust your schedule.
I am sorry that Skambis has such a dis-
torted and paranoid view of his instructors. I believe that most of us are here to educate and improve the Student Body . One way to do that is to discourage cheating.
But no matter how hard we try to improve 
the life of a student, it cannot happen if the stu-dent doesn’t wish to improve. I suggest that students attempt to meet their instructors. The students might actually find out that instruc-tors have their best interests in mind. 
There is far too much cheating in this world. 
From politics to Wall Street, we live with the ramifications of dishonesty daily. I sincerely hope that no one reads Skambis’ words and accepts them as rationalization for cheating.

Student Senate should recognize minor-
ity studentsI am appalled at the racism that exists in 
the UF Student Senate. I am a graduate stu-
dent who represents a constituency that is comprised of all races and groups, and these actions are appalling to me on a personal level because I am an international student.
The actions taken by the Student Senate, 
which I will mention later, are both concerning and saddening. The Student Senate represents all of The Gator Nation, which is comprised of every possible race and ethnicity imaginable. Student Government must, by its mandate, fight for the best interests of all its students and not a select few.
The actions of which I am speaking of in-
clude the following: (1) Failing to pass condo-lences to the parents of Trayvon Martin last week and (2) failing to add to the agenda to send condolences to Omair Usmani.
Why are the above mentioned actions ap-
palling and saddening, you ask?
The tragedy of the Trayvon Martin shooting 
has revealed the deep, underlying racial ten-sions that exist in the U.S. Even if you believe George Zimmerman is innocent, the inaction of the Sanford Police by not doing the usual drug-testing and witness-searching common in standard legal procedure demonstrates the deep, psychological racial problem that exists in the criminal justice system.
The reactions of the American people and 
the amount of coverage in the media also show the deep, psychological racial tensions that exist in the American conscious.
The reasons given for failing to pass this 
bill were that the bill mentioned the race of both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin and not convicting any side. If you don’t be-lieve that racism exists, just ask a friend who belongs to a minority group. You will likely hear stories that would appall you.
By recognizing the impact of race on this 
issue, Student Government would show the willingness that we are ready to fight these racial tensions and make this university and community a place where every person feels safe and welcome. As for the second signal of racism, you might remember the story in the Alligator that ran this week mentioning a student was hit by a semitrailer and hospital-ized at Shands. Omair Usmani, a student and member of The Gator Nation, is now fighting for his life. This student was thrown under the rug by the Senate.
This Senate, which passes resolutions about 
birthdays, deaths, etc., somehow failed to pass a condolence for a student of South Asian de-scent. 
This resolution failed to pass due to a tech-
nicality , which could have easily been fixed by the amendment process.
I am saddened, and I hope for the sake of 
the students that we, as a Senate, can recognize our faults and address them.

� THE STUDY COULD COST UP TO $25K.
ADRIANNA PAIDAS
Alligator Writer
A new study may be done at the area around 
the Cabot/Koppers Superfund site that is different 
from previous studies that measured toxic contami-nation.
The Gainesville City Commission decided 
Thursday to take a step toward hiring a consultant who will measure the amount of deterioration in the neighborhoods around the toxic site.
The study could cost the city up to $25,000, ac-
cording to city officials.
The area is bordered by Northeast Second Street 
and Northwest 39th Avenue. The area extends west of Northwest 13th Street and a few miles south of Northwest 23rd Avenue.
The “blight study” would determine if the low-
income area around the site could be dubbed a new Community Redevelopment Agency area, making it the city’s fifth district managed by the city agen-cy.
When a particular part of the city is declared a 
Community Redevelopment Agency area, it is revi-talized through public money in order to stimulate economic growth and attract more residents to the dilapidated area.
In a 6-to-1 vote, with Commissioner Todd Chase 
dissenting, the commission directed staff to develop a request to hire a consultant.
Though most of the commissioners thought the 
study was a good idea, Chase said he did not sup-port it because cleanup is scheduled to begin within the next year as part of the U.S. Environmental Pro-tection Agency’s plan to decontaminate the site.
“I’m not sure if I’m comfortable with doing a 
blight study until we know what is happening in this area,” Chase said. “Because once you get the ball rolling, it’s hard to peel it back.”
Commissioner Susan Bottcher disagreed.Because the study will only show if the area 
qualifies as an official Community Redevelop-ment Agency area, Bottcher said there is no harm in checking out the possibility.

The Gainesville-based Web development and 
digital marketing firm that has built websites for 
companies all over the country can now boast another major client: the Tampa Bay Times.
The newspaper picked 352 Media Group 
about a year ago to revamp its website, beating out four companies from around the U.S.
The website will launch this summer, said 
John Schlander, senior editor/online operations at the Tampa Bay Times.
“This is a significant job for us,” said Geoff 
Wilson, president and CEO of 352 Media Group. “It’s definitely a high-profile job.”
The Web development company began in a 
Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity house at UF in 1997. 
Wilson and a team of two built websites for 
small businesses around the state. Back then, Wilson charged his clients about $50.
Today, 352 Media Group has offices in four 
other cities around the U.S. and charges about $50,000 to build a website, Wilson said.
“We knew we wanted our new website to be 
an engaging site with personality,” Schlander said. “They are a serious business with technical chops, but there was a sense of fun and creativity that came along with it.”
The main purpose of the new website is to 
create a more personalized experience for read-ers, making articles that fit their interests easier to find, said Pete Bernardo, 352 Media Group digital strategist and project manager.
Executives from the Tampa Bay Times did a 
nationwide search for a Web development firm to redesign their website and improve the over -
all experience for visitors.The company was the only finalist with Flori-
da roots. Other companies competing for the job were from cities such as New York and Dallas, said Patty Cox, a Tampa Bay Times consultant on the project. Cox and Schlander oversee the website’s development.
Times staff found the company on Google 
when they decided to redevelop the newspa-per’s website about a year and a half ago.
“We knew that our website was not up to the 
standard of our print newspaper,” Schlander said.
Cox visited the 352 Media Group website and 
loved the home page, which displays animated cartoon images alongside real people on a lime green and royal blue backdrop.
“It was a whimsical, energetic, fun approach 
to their website,” Schlander said. “We got in con-tact with them right away.”
Wilson, Bernardo and a team from 352 Media 
Group presented a proposal to about 10 execu-tives from the Tampa Bay Times. Soon after, the job was theirs.
Their energetic presentation, ideas and in-
depth knowledge on how to analyze what peo-ple want on a website landed them the contract, Cox said.
Over the past year, thousands of surveys 
were passed out to those who read articles on the site. The surveys asked questions that gave Bernardo and his team an idea of the types of people who visit the site and why they visit the site. That way, it’s easier to generate where cer -
tain content should go.
“It’s got to be more than a nice display of pho-
tography and nice fonts,” Schlander said. “There has to be a business sense. They know that.”

Senior outfielder Daniel Pigott (8) failed to tag up from third base and score the tying run after Preston 
Tucker hit a fly ball to right field in the bottom of the ninth inning in No. 1 Florida’s 7-6 loss No. 12 LSU.  
� GATORS LOSE SERIES 
OPENER TO LSU 7-6.

Florida’s entire dugout thought 
Preston Tucker’s one-out shot to 
right was gone in three-run walk-off fashion. Unfortunately for the Gators, Daniel Pigott thought so too. 
UF’s senior center fielder 
went into premature celebration mode while standing a handful of steps off third base. When the ball landed in the glove of LSU right fielder Mason Katz, Pigott had choked away a chance to tie the score at seven and complete a big Florida rally. He did not tag up. Brian Johnson was on deck for the game’s final at-bat, but the evening was over. 
“You can’t run the bases for 
them,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “I’ve got no explanation for it. I’ve never seen it. … He jumped up and down and thought it was a home run and lost his cool instead of just going back to the bag.”
Euphoria boiled into frustra-
tion in a matter of seconds. Before Pigott’s gaffe and a hard-swinging strikeout by Mike Zunino, Florida had runners on first and third with no outs in the ninth inning. What fans had not been chased away by an initial 6-2 deficit were buzzing. Minutes later, they were silenced and stunned. No. 1 Florida (24-6, 6-4 Southeastern Conference) lost to No. 12 LSU (24-6, 7-3 SEC), 7-6 on Thursday night. 
The defeat snapped a 15-game 
home winning streak for the Gators and continued a rut in which they have lost four out of their last five games. 
“We’ve got to put some pieces 
together,” junior left fielder Vick-ash Ramjit said. “We’re just strug-gling right now.”
Trouble started early for the 
Gators on Thursday. The Tigers were all over starter Brian John-son in the first inning, racking up three runs on three hits, high-lighted by RBI singles from Aus-tin Nola and Alex Edward. 
When Florida began to stand 
its ground a bit and climb back into the game, LSU piled up an-other three-run inning in the fourth despite having no baser -
unners and two outs when eight-hole hitter Jordy Snikeris stepped in and singled.

Guard Kenny Boynton is return-
ing to UF for his senior year, he an-
nounced on Thursday via his Twit-ter account.
“To confirm the questions being 
ask lately I have reached a decision and I am returning to Gainesville for my senior season,” the tweet said.
Boynton was Florida’s lead-
ing scorer last year, averaging 15.9 points per game on 40.7 percent 3-point shooting.
He was projected as a fringe 
NBA draft prospect but was still considering making a jump to the professional ranks.
The decision did not come easy 
for Boynton, who was undecided on his future as recently as this week.“I don’t know what I’m going to 
do, honestly,” he said on Monday.
But, after discussing his options 
with his family — his mother visited 
Gainesville ear -
lier in the week — Boynton decided to return.
By doing so, 
he gives himself a shot at UF’s career scoring record. He has notched 1,589 ca-
reer points, good for eighth on UF’s all-time list.
He is just 501 points shy of Ron-
nie Williams’ UF career record of 2,090. Boynton scored 525 points as a sophomore and 588 as a junior.

It has taken nearly six years, but James Wilson 
is poised to finally make it through his first healthy 
spring.
Wilson, a redshirt senior offensive lineman, is 
the last remaining member of Urban Meyer’s na-tional championship squad in 2008 and was grant-ed a sixth season of eligibility in January due to a medical hardship.
The main culprit keeping the 6-foot-4, 327-pound 
guard off the field has been a pair of broken feet his sophomore year and the four surgeries needed to repair his injured left knee. While he missed all of last spring recovering from a surgery , Wilson said he is ready to play at 1 p.m. Saturday during Flori-da’s spring game.
“I went to coach Muschamp and told him, ‘Hey 
coach, I made it through my first spring,’” Wil-son said. “He was all happy. It was kind of a big deal, but I just got to keep trucking. I got to make it through my first camp now.” 
After working his way back into the Gators’ line 
rotation, Wilson earned his lone start of last season in Florida’s bowl victory against Ohio State. He said he found out the NCAA was allowing him to come back in the spring during the game.
“It’s good to see him back out there,” offensive lineman Chaz Green said. “He’s capitalized on it. It’s his last year, make the best of it.” 
A healthy Wilson heading into next season 
would mean added depth to an offensive line group that struggled last year. With another year under their belt, Wilson said the linemen have be-gun to communicate better and are growing more comfortable working together this spring.
“Marked improvement up front from a year ago 
at this time, or at any time last year,” coach Will Muschamp said. “You see some guys, and you go back and look at it and those guys have been play-
ing together for a year. ”
Floyd adjusting: In his 
first extended action at de-fensive end, Sharrif Floyd 
has had a hard time adjusting to life on the outside.
Floyd, a junior, is working primarily off the edge 
instead of his natural defensive tackle position this spring due to injuries to Dominique Easley and Earl Okine.
“I started spring as a D-end and just really wasn’t 
comfortable with it, because it’s the first time I ever played it like constantly rep after rep,” Floyd said. “The spring before that, the offseason before that, I was at defensive tackle so it was just a different transition.”

Everyone seemed to have 
his own faults. Ramjit had the best offensive night of his career, going 3 for 4 with four RBI — two in a clutch two-out spot in the eighth that got the Gators within one. However, he also had Florida’s other glaring base-running error of the night in the fourth when he was thrown out returning to second on a Cody Dent fly ball. 
“I had three hits but that 
didn’t do anything,” Ramjit said. “It was just upsetting how we lost. … It’s a tough loss right now.”Pigott had been 3 for 5

in a 10-8 win at Ohio State on March 24 and will return to the starting lineup on Saturday as No. 4 Florida (12-2, 2-0 American Lacrosse Con-ference) travels to Baltimore to take on No. 19 Johns Hopkins (7-3, 0-1 ALC).
The Gators defeated Fresno State 
29-0 and beat No. 10 Penn State, 20-11, in the two games Cullen was out. 
“I commend the team for really 
stepping up and doing a great job in her absence,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. “But we are looking forward to getting her back on the field.”
Cullen, who led Florida with 47 
points prior to the concussion, said she has been symptom-free since Saturday.
“I started feeling better the day 
before the Penn State game, but I knew I wasn’t going to be ready to play by then,” Cullen said. “My first practice was (Wednesday), and since everything went well I know I’ll be able to play this weekend.”
Freshmen midfielders Nicole 
Graziano and Shannon Gilroy have helped shoulder the scoring load with Cullen out. In the last two games, Graziano has nine goals and three assists while Gilroy found the back of the net five times against Penn State.
“It’s so nice knowing that if you 
are going to get injured or you are coming out of the game that you have people that can go in and can still get the job done,” Cullen said of the younger players’ contributions.
As the regular season comes to 
an end and the schedule gets tough-er, junior attacker Caroline Chester -
man said the depth the Gators have developed becomes more impor -
tant.
“We have complete confidence 
in everyone on the team,” Chester -
man said. “If someone else is hav-ing an off day and someone needs to step in, they will do that, and the last two games have completely shown that.”
Even if Cullen is not scoring 
goals in bunches come Sunday , O’Leary said it changes the game to have her on the field. 
“Anytime she has the ball, the 
defense has to be concerned,” O’Leary said. “They’re going to be really quick to slide the double team over to her.”
O’Leary praised Cullen’s abil-
ity to create for others and find her teammates this season when she is double-teamed. In 2011, Cullen had 56 goals and five assists through 12 games while she has 29 goals and 20 assists in as many games this sea-son.
Florida defeated Johns Hopkins 
14-10 in Gainesville in 2011 with Cullen scoring five goals.
A native of Rockville, Md., Cul-
len said she is excited to be able to make her return in her home state against the Blue Jays.
“All my cousins have been tex-
ting me all week and all my aunts and uncles,” Cullen said. “A lot of my really good friends from high school are coming home for Easter and they’re all coming out to the game.”
Cullen set to return from concussion
“We have complete con-
fidence in everyone on the 
team.”

HOST TO THE PEPSI FLORIDA RE-LAYS STARTING TODAY.

While most seniors in high school are 
looking ahead to their graduation, Gators 
freshman Dedric Dukes is focusing on the Pepsi Florida Relays. 
Dukes, who could still be finishing up 
his last semester of his senior year, decid-ed to enroll early at Florida in January.
On Feb. 4, Dukes helped the Gators 
finish in second place in the 4x400m re-lay at the Virginia Tech Elite Meet in his first competition. Dukes also came in sixth place in the men’s 200m, missing the auto-matic qualifying mark by less than a sec-ond.
“It’s been pretty tough because of com-
ing in out of shape, and it’s my first time running indoors,” Dukes said. “It was pretty hard to adjust to indoor because I’m so used to running outdoors.”
Despite joining the Gators only six days 
before their first indoor meet of the season, Dukes has shown that he can be a valuable asset on the team. His strongest contribu-tion so far this year has been in the relays.
In addition to his performance at the 
Virginia Tech Elite Meet, Dukes helped contribute to a fourth-place finish in the 4x1600m relay at the SEC Indoor Cham-pionships and he helped UF finish third in the 4x400m relay last weekend at the Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays.]
“I felt pretty good. I trusted in my 
coaching and training that everything was going to be good,” Dukes said. “I was a little bit nervous, but I just let everything happen.”
This weekend at Florida’s first home 
outdoor meet of the season, the Gators will need Dukes to continue his trend of being a strong leg for the relay teams. Dukes will be competing in the 4x200m relay and the 4x400m relay.
“We could push the stick a little bit 
better, and get the changes and hand-offs much, much better, which we’ve been working on this week,” Dukes said. “We have a lot more to work on, but I think we’ll do pretty good at the Florida Re-lays.” 
The Florida Relays begin today at Percy 
Beard Track at 9 a.m. Sophomore David Levin and junior David Triassi will start things off for the men in the hammer throw, and freshman Manuela Burtsher will open for the women in the discus throw.
“It’s always an exciting time around 
here for the Florida Relays. Our athletes are excited and everybody associated with the program is excited about it,” coach Mike Holloway said. “It’s a chore putting the meet on, but it’s something that we re-ally enjoy doing.”Freshman will be key at home meetgymnastics

Despite the pressures of postseason 
action, the Gators have plenty of reasons 
to feel comfortable Saturday. 
Coming off its eighth Southeastern 
Conference title in school history, No. 1 Florida (17-1, 5-1 SEC) will return to Ra-leigh, N.C., the site of its season opener, to take part in its NCAA Regional Cham-pionships at 4 p.m.
In UF’s first meet of the season against 
North Carolina State on Jan. 6, it domi-nated the Wolfpack, 196.025-194.675.
“N.C. State by far is the best place we 
could have been placed,” junior Randy Stageberg said. “It’s three hours away from my home, so I have a lot of fam-ily and friends coming. Most of them haven’t seen me compete before in a col-lege meet.”
Along with No. 20 N.C. State, Flori-
da’s competition will consist of No. 12 Ohio State, No. 13 Penn State, Kent State and North Carolina. The two top-scor -
ing teams Saturday will advance to the NCAA Championships on April 20. 
The Gators hope previously compet-
ing in Reynolds Coliseum will prove to be a benefit. Many Gators have said that the Wolfpack’s apparatuses feel similar to their home equipment. 
“We’ve been to N.C. State, the athletes 
remember the arena, we know visually what the setup of the equipment is like, we’ve been on the equipment,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “It’s not going to be something that’s unfamiliar to them.”
UF’s rotational order also looks to be 
favorable. After starting out on uneven bars and balance beam, the team will take a bye and then compete on floor ex-ercise and vault before finishing out with another bye. 
The Gators are currently No. 1 in the 
country on both bars and beam. 
“It’s a great draw,” Faehn said. “It’s 
nice to finish out on a bye because you just get your job done and you don’t have to sit out another rotation and then come back again into the competition.”
As the Gators should feel accustomed 
to their location for regionals, Faehn said she believes her squad is also in a great place mentally. 
“This team is a com-
pletely different team. Different group, differ-
ent mentality,” Faehn said. “We feel like 
they’re confident and ready to go.” 
Ellis likely out on vault: Faehn said 
senior Nicole Ellis might not take part in the vault lineup Saturday due to a hip in-jury she suffered against Utah. If Ellis is a no-go, she said freshmen Kiersten Wang or Jamie Shisler would step in to take her place. 
Faehn added that Ellis might compete 
on bars if she feels up to the task Satur -

Floyd hoping for switch back to defensive tackle for fall season
smoothly, Floyd said he is enjoying 
his best spring of his career and has improved his pass-rush skills. How-ever, once the fall season starts, he’s looking forward to resuming his old duties in the interior.
  “We’re still low on numbers 
right now, so it’s still about what we have and what we need,” Floyd said. “So right now I’m a D-end but ideally , getting ready for the season, it should be inside for good.”
  Special teams: After splitting 
time with departed senior David Lerner last season, Kyle Christy has created some separation for Flori-da’s starting punting job.
  Muschamp said Christy had his 
best day at Florida last Wednesday punting the ball. Christy, a sopho-more, started the ﬁ  nal seven games last season and averaged 40.9 yards on 30 punts.
  “He’s got the leg, he’s got the 
tools, he’s got the talent,” Mus-champ said. 
“It’s a matter of doing it all the 
time and David was much more consistent in camp last fall in Au-gust going into the season. But, as Kyle continued to improve that con-sistency , that’s what enabled him to get the job.”
  Muschamp also had rave reviews 
for redshirt senior kicker Caleb Stur-gis, who was a 2011 ﬁ  nalist for the Lou Groza award. Muschamp said Sturgis has kicked “extremely well” and was last Saturday’s special teams player of the day.

With the Gators’ annual spring game, the Orange & Blue Debut, scheduled for this Saturday, we at alligatorSports want to get you 
prepared. Each day this week, we will give you a new piece from three separate top-five lists: something to look for during the spring game, an area the team must improve upon in 2012 and a major storyline to follow as the spring season comes to a close.
� SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR DURING 
SATURDAY’S GAME:
2. Turnovers
Florida was so inept in both protecting the 
ball and taking it away last season that any sign of progress should be taken as a positive. Before the Gators kicked off fall camp last season, Will Muschamp pointed to two statistics as the most important: turnovers and big plays. But UF fin-ished 113th nationally with a minus-0.92 margin, forcing only 14 and losing 26.  Watch to see if the young quarterbacks are making smart decisions and if the defense is playing aggressively, closing quickly and making plays on the ball. Remember, it is the spring game, so take everything with a grain of salt and focus more on individual perfor -
mances.
1. Quarterbacks
It’s tough to learn too much from just a spring 
game, but it will be interesting to 
see how comfortably Brissett and Driskel can run the offense. New offensive coordinator Brent Pease has tried to make the adjustment as seamless as possible for his sophomore signal-callers, but the task of learning new plays, shifts and motions will still be daunting. 
If one of the young quarterbacks can display a comfort, command and maturity in the offense, it will bode well for his chances come fall. It will be a good sign for the chances of Florida’s offense, too.� AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
2. Quarterback play
Florida needs a major improvement at the 
most important position on the field. Last sea-son, the trio of John Brantley, Jeff Driskel and Jacoby Brissett led the nation’s No. 89 passing offense. The Gators tallied just 13 touchdowns and 13 interceptions and ranked No. 101 with only 320 pass attempts on the year. Much of those struggles were blamed on John Brantley’s injuries, but even a healthy Brantley threw for only 185.8 yards per game with 11 touchdowns and 7 interceptions, and that was with the benefit of three missed halves against stalwarts Alabama and LSU.
1. Offensive Line
Without question, the Gators struggled last 
season because they struggled up front. The offensive line was a sieve, getting pushed around 
in pass protection and failing to 
knock defenders off the ball in the run game. With two inexperienced options at quarterback, the ability to run the ball and prevent the type of pass rush that sidelined starter John Brantley last season will be imperative. The line took the brunt of Muschamp’s criticism for being 
soft, and as defensive coordinator Dan Quinn put it last week, they have received the memo. Prog-ress in this area will be paramount to Florida’s chances at a successful season in 2012.

� STORYLINE TO WATCH:
2. Center of Offense
Last year, if Chris Rainey didn’t have a good 
game, neither did the Gators. The offense ran 
through his hands, as the senior running back led the team in rushing attempts (171), rush-ing yards (861) and receptions (31). If Rainey wasn’t getting the ball, he was used as a decoy to open up other options. Now, with Rainey and fellow back Jeff Demps gone, Florida will have to look elsewhere for its key cog on offense. There isn’t a proven player at any of the skill po-sitions, and a balanced attack led by a strong downhill running game is likely to be the focal point, meaning several players will be counted on to produce on a consistent basis.
1. Driskel/Brissett
The quarterback controversy has domi-
nated the spring conversation, as everyone 
wants to know who will be 
under center when the season begins. Although Muschamp says the process is ongoing and will downplay the significance of Saturday, someone will have to take the first snap with the first-team offense. Neither Driskel nor Brissett has distanced 
himself in the spring after a difficult freshman campaign. Driskel completed 16 of 34 passes for 148 yards and two interceptions, while Bris-sett completed 18 of 39 passes for 206 yards, 
two touchdowns and four interceptions. 
Who has made the biggest jump? 
Driskel
