MAKALA FURSE IS THE FIRST 
WOMAN OF COLOR TO HOLD 
THE POSITION
By Kaelyn Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
Makala Furse loves to read, edit 
and learn from the articles in the Flor-
ida Law Review — and she was able 
to prove her passion and tell 59 of her 
peers why she should be the next per-
son to lead it.
Furse, who was elected on Sunday, 
will be the first woman of color to 
serve as the Florida Law Review’s ed-
itor-in-chief since the law school was 
desegregated in 1958. 
The law review, which is published 
by the UF Levin College of Law, is a 
student-edited law journal that pub-
lishes articles and other scholarly work 
about legal issues. It was created in 
1948, a decade before the law school 
was desegregated. Law journals are a 
way for professors and legal scholars 
to get their work edited and published, 
and the Florida Law Review is ranked 
25th of student-edited law journals in 
the country by Washington and Lee 
University School of Law. 
Furse is 25 years old and a second-
year law student. She has a master’s 
degree in social work from the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles. She 
said in that line of work, she had a lot 
of responsibility and thinks the skills 
she learned will be directly transfer-
able to her position as editor-in-chief.  
While she’s excited and knows 
she’s capable, Furse said she’s also 
nervous because she’s also the first 
black woman to hold the title. With 
so much attention on her, she doesn’t 
want to let anyone down. 
“I’m really humbled to be in this 
position,” she said. “I’m so excited, 
and I hope that me being in this posi-
tion will pave the way for more people 
of color in leadership positions in law 
schools.”
Andrea Faverio is a 23-year-old sec-
ond-year law student who works at the 
Florida Law Review with Furse.
“If I had to use one word, she’s 
amazing,” Faverio said. “But she’s so 
much more than that.”
Faverio said Furse was someone 
who always volunteered to edit extra 
articles and had a strong hand in coor-Law Review

Local topics were at the forefront at a 
forum with candidates vying for a position on

THE BUILDING WAS SCHEDULED 
TO OPEN LAST FALL

Alligator Staff Writer
In Fall 2019, engineering students were sup-
posed to start working in the Herbert Wertheim 
Laboratory of Engineering Excellence, located  
between the Reitz Union and Weimer Hall.But construction wasn’t done. UF spokes-
person Steve Orlando said last April that con-
struction would be done in Spring 2020. Yet, 
two months into the Spring semester, construc-
tion on the building isn’t done yet — and won’t 
be done until March or April, said Helen Goh, 
the College of Engineering spokesperson. 
Josh Levi, a 22-year-old UF biomedical en-
gineering graduate student, said he hoped he’d 
be able to utilize the new building.
“When I was an undergrad, I thought I would see the completion of the new lab,” he 
said. “As a grad student, I thought for sure that 
I could utilize it, but now we’ll see.”
Last Spring, Orlando said the building was, 
at that time, $20 million over budget, costing 
about $72.2 million in total. The project was 
originally projected to cost $53 million. 
The funding will come from several sources, 
including $28.4 million from the Public Educa-Five City Commission candidates talk local issues

“Nominal fine” was the catchphrase 
for the UF Student Government election 
violation hearings Thursday and 
Monday. 
Gator Party raked in 17 violations 
total: 16 violations for $5 each, plus 
one $20 nominal fine, totaling $100 
in violations fines. A nonpartisan SG 
elections commission comprised of UF 
law students found Inspire Party was 
only found guilty of one. 
Student Body President-elect Trevor 
Pope, who ran with Gator Party, 
announced his candidacy on his 
fraternity’s website and solicited support 
outside of election season, which the 
commission deemed as a violation. 
Gator was punished with a $20 fine. 
The message mentioned that “Recent 
winning campaigns have cost upwards 
to twenty thousand dollars,” which 
Inspire said was far more than they ever 
spent on their campaign and proved that 
Gator had a financial advantage. 
That financial advantage means 
that the $5 fine isn’t enough to 
hold Gator accountable, Inspire 
representative Ashley Grabowski said 
during the hearing. She recommended 
disqualification as a punishment. 
“I think it often is more of a cop-out 
than an honest answer for why decisions 
are being made,” Grabowski said in an 
interview after the hearing.
Despite their recent resignations from 
Inspire, former party presidents Zachary 
Amrose and Ben Lima represented Inspire during the hearings along with 
Grabowski. 
Jeremy O’Brien Murillo, a former 
independent write-in candidate for the 
student honor code chancellor, was 
accused of distributing “I voted” stickers 
during the election. The commission 
said that action violated SG rules, 
which states that only the supervisor 
of elections and those delegated can 
distribute stickers. 
As a punishment, O’Brien Murillo 
was banned from participation in SG for 
the next calendar year. 
Despite Inspire denying any current 
affiliation with O’Brien Murillo or any 
participation in his sticker distribution,  
including a signed affidavit from him and 
the party’s president, the commission 
still determined he was affiliated with 
Inspire. 
O’Brien Murillo was a member of 
Inspire’s campaign in Fall 2017, but said 
he has had no role in the party since 
then. The commission mentioned his 
prior involvement, frequent Facebook 
posts supporting the party and wearing 
Inspire clothes while deciding on his 
affiliation. 
The commission gave Inspire a 
permanent injunction, or formal order, 
requiring the party to not distribute 
“I voted” stickers as part of O’Brien 
Murillo’s punishment. But this is already 
a requirement under election rules. 
O’Brien Murillo said he plans to 
appeal that decision by working with 
groups that advocate for free speech.
This semester, Gator also received 
multiple violations related to posting online political advertisements 
incorrectly. 
Inspire asked the commission to 
punish them more harshly, like requiring 
a public apology or a plan to fix problems 
moving forward. In the Fall, Gator had 
to write a plan to prevent themselves 
from getting violations stemming from 
canvassing on campus in addition to 
minimal fees.
Inspire faced losing its majority in 
the Senate when Gator filed an election 
violation last Fall. It claimed that Inspire 
sent an ad over email on election day 
which warranted disqualification.
The UF Supreme Court eventually 
found the email was not a violation. 
After the final elections meeting, Gator representatives did not answer 
questions from The Alligator. Katie 
Hernandez, Gator campaign manager, 
and Branden Pearson, a representative 
for Gator during the hearing, both texted 
the following statement: 
“Gator Party is dedicated to ensuring 
a fair election and supports the Election 
Commission’s authority as outlined in 
the codes. We look forward to validating 
the election results at tonight’s senate 
meeting, as it is a reflection of the 
student’s hope for a better student 
government,” they wrote.

Here is a breakdown of some key 
election rules discussed:  
All campaign material must be labeled as registered political 
advertisements and registered and approved by the supervisor of 
elections prior to distribution. 
Only the Supervisor of Elections and people he or she approves 
can distribute any material to distribute material indicating that a 
student has already voted in the SG election cycle. 
Campaign activities start on the ﬁ  rst day of the election cycle 
and end immediately after polls close on the last day of elections.
The election cycle is the time from the beginning of the 
informational meeting held by the Supervisor of Elections until

BOYFRIEND OF STRIKING AND KILLING HER
By Samia Lagmis
Alligator Staff Writer
A Lake City man remains in jail after he was accused 
of killing his girlfriend in a hit-and-run crash Saturday, ac-
cording to the Florida Highway Patrol.
Witnesses reported seeing Ryan LeBoss, 44, driving 
a pickup truck on Interstate 75 near exit 399 in Alachua 
County at about 5 p.m. as his girlfriend, Eileen Bocca, was 
clinging onto the passenger door, according to a release 
from FHP. 
Bocca, 48, was dragged several hundred feet by the 
truck before being run over by its rear right tire, said FHP 
Lt. Patrick Riordan. She was transported to UF Health Shands Hospital where she was pronounced dead. 
Authorities don’t know if Bocca was pushed, jumped or 
fell out of the vehicle, Riordan said.
LeBoss fled the scene on southbound I-75, and was last 
seen exiting at the 390-mile marker exit onto 39th Avenue 
in an unknown direction, Riordan said. 
Riordan said authorities arrested LeBoss at about 1 or 
2 a.m. Sunday at his home in Columbia County. He was 
compliant with authorities during the arrest.
Riordan credited the Alachua, Marion and Columbia 
County Sheriff’s offices for their assistance in the investi-
gation and arrest. 
The incident came one day after FHP held a press con-
ference for Florida Hit-and-Run Awareness Month and dis-
cussed the importance of staying at the scene of a crash.
“It was ironic that we had that press conference on Fri-
day and this occurred the next day,” Riordan said.
He anticipates the investigation will be “long and thor-ough” and will take FHP at least 60 to 90 
days to conduct. 
LeBoss is being held in Columbia 
County jail on charges of leaving the 
scene of a crash involving death with no 
bond. 
In 2008, LeBoss was accused of as-
saulting a police officer or firefighter and 
resisting arrest with violence in Miami, 
according to court records. 
Bocca, of Ocala, had aggravated battery charges pend-
ing in Citrus County, according to an arrest affidavit. The 
charges stemmed from a September incident where she 
was accused of stabbing her boyfriend. 
Her next court date was scheduled for March 12.

THE CASE MAY SERVE AS A 
PRECEDENT FOR VOTING RIGHTS
By Samantha Chery
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida is one step closer to expanding voting 
rights for the formerly incarcerated.
Last week, a federal appeals court decided 
Florida could not ban 17 formerly incarcerated 
people, including two from Alachua County, 
from voting due to unpaid fines or fees. 
While the decision for the case, Jones v. 
DeSantis, only applies to the formerly incarcer-
ated who sued, a decision on all Florida felons 
with outstanding fees will be decided at a trial 
in April — after the Florida primaries, but just in 
time for the 2020 general election.
The recent ruling came nearly two years af-
ter about 65 percent of Floridians voted ‘yes’ to 
Amendment 4, which restores voting rights to felons who have finished their sentences, ex-
cluding those who committed murder or felony 
sexual offenses.
However, last June, the Republican-con-
trolled Florida Legislature passed State Bill 7066, 
which required payment of all court-related fees 
as part of completing a punishment. 
Arthur Rizer, the director of criminal justice 
and civil liberties at R Street Institute, a public 
policy research organization, believes this add-
ed hurdle to voting is unnecessary. 
“Everything in our penal code should be 
related to public safety,” he said. “I don’t see 
a public safety means to prevent people from 
voting.” 
Rizer, who is also an adjunct professor at 
George Mason University’s law school, was part 
of the team of lawyers who crafted the legal ar-
gument against the voting restrictions in Jones 
v. DeSantis. 
He believes that formerly incarcerated peo-
ple should have their voting rights restored once they’re no longer incarcerated.
“When you’re out, you’re out,” he said. “We 
should bring you back to society as quickly as 
possible, and voting is one of the easiest things 
that we can do to make that happen.”
Almost immediately after the Republican 
Legislature’s decision, the plaintiffs, including 
Gainesville resident Jeff Gruver and Alachua 
County resident Kristopher Wrench, whose 
only obstacle to voting was being unable to af-
ford fees, sued to regain their right to vote, ac-
cording to public records. 
“It’s not even about the court costs,” said 
Elizabeth Laura Whitaker, 31, who served time 
in Pasco County Jail for theft, burglary, deal-
ing in stolen property, writing a bad check and 
credit card fraud. “It’s really just about the fact 
that these people are felons.”
Whitaker, who said she knows many people 
affected by Amendment 4, believes state politi-
cians are using the stigma surrounding felons 
to justify suppressing the votes of the group, which consists of nearly 2 million people.
“I know a lot of people who are felons who 
have no idea what’s going on politically because 
felons being able to get their rights to vote back 
is such a new thing,” she said.
Rizer said he doesn’t believe that granting 
voting rights to all felons will drastically change 
the political landscape, as they probably will not 
be very politically active. He compared this to 
the voter turnout of young people.
He also said he doesn’t think the Republican 
Legislature made voting rights more restrictive 
as a voter suppression tactic or out of malice. 
He said he just wishes these groups were more 
politically active.
“I wish that was the case,” he said. “I wish 
they were more involved in everything.”

“You can just feel, in the way that 
she speaks, her passion,” said Rachael 
Schafer, a 24-year-old second-year law 
student, who also works at the Flori-
da Law Review. “It’s really incredible 
how much she wants to contribute to 
the Review.” 
Furse said that she’s thankful for 
the support of her friends, family and professors, as well as the members of 
the Florida Law Review and the Black 
Law Students Association.
“I’ve always wanted to do some-
thing like this, and I never thought it 
would be when I’m 25 years old,” she 
said.

coalition members, and the forum 
questions were created by the 
coalition’s board. 
Candidate responses will be 
published in the organization’s 
February quarterly newsletter, he 
said.
The coalition does not and will 
not endorse candidates because of 
its status as a nonprofit, Tattersall 
said. The organization’s goal is 
simply to highlight issues important 
to its membership. 
“We want to influence elected 
officials, not get them elected,” he 
said.
Candidates discussed five topics 
based on the responses to the 
questionnaires.
University issues and remedies
To address the toll of UF on 
the Gainesville community, Reina 
Saco, Scherwin Henry, Harvey 
Ward, Gabe Kaimowitz and David 
Arreola discussed raising UF staff 
wages. 
Arreola believes addressing this 
issue requires more than increasing 
wages because UF needs to buy 
more energy from Gainesville 
Regional Utilities and rely on sustainable local food sources. 
Ward shared a similar viewpoint, 
but also added that he believes 
elected officials in Tallahassee are 
part of the problem because they 
don’t have “the best interest of this 
community at heart.”
Kaimowitz said the city simply 
can’t partner with UF because 
he believes it’s “an oppressive, 
capitalistic institution.” 
Renter’s bill of rights proposal
All candidates agreed that a 
renter’s bill of rights would be a 
useful addition to Gainesville’s 
policy. 
Henry believes the proposal 
would simplify the traditional 
complex wording of a lease, thus 
giving renters enough information 
to make educated decisions. 
Ward also agrees, adding that it 
would ease those who might be 
“embarrassed and uncomfortable 
asking for clarification of their 
rights.”
Arreola and Saco focused on the 
proposal’s emphasis on safe and 
affordable housing. Saco referred to 
it as her “overdue baby” because of 
her role in the drafting process.
“I’m pretty sure I dream about 
this project,” she said.
Combating food deserts 
There was a lot of disagreement 
among candidates on how to best 
address food deserts, or areas 
lacking grocery stores or markets. 
Saco and Arreola both discussed 
expanding farmers’ markets and 
locally owned grocers to areas of 
Gainesville without them.
Ward said the issue of 
food deserts traces back to transportation, as those who 
cannot travel far miss out on fresh 
produce, and must be addressed 
through the expansion of “First 
Mile, Last Mile,” the micro transit 
system in east Gainesville. Henry 
believes there is an intersection 
between economic development 
and food solutions — introducing 
gardens on rooftops, for instance.
But Kaimowitz disagrees. He 
believes the issue lies in the lack 
of access to food stamps and other 
government programs. 
Living wages for all city 
employees
All candidates agreed on a living 
wage for city employees. However, 
there was disagreement on how 
that would be accomplished.
Ward and Arreola have been 
working on this proposal through 
the city commission, but have spent 
six months waiting for approval 
from the general and city manager. 
Ward believes two months after 
approval is given, the ordinance can 
be passed. Arreola said it should be 
sometime this year.
Saco believes it can be 
accomplished by the next budget 
but needs to employ a staggered 
approach to get to $15. Loopholes 
need to be closed for contractors, 
and money needs to flow back to 
the local economy. 
Henry, a former senior biological 
scientist at UF, believes this can be 
done this year, but goals need to be 
laid out with deadlines. 
“When I started at university, I 
was making $2.73 an hour in 1973. 
In today’s dollars, that equals to 
$18 an hour,” he said, adding that 
the standard of a living wage is not 
enough.Affordable housing 
Arreola said the housing market 
is affected by luxury apartment 
complexes, which are unaffordable 
to most students and residents. 
He proposes that 20 percent of 
units must be affordable because 
developers are not going to stop 
building. 
Saco agrees, adding that 
developers will continue to build, 
even with restrictions, because 
there is a market in Gainesville as a 
“college town.”
Ward said the issue is an 
American city problem. He agrees 
with Arreola’s statement and 
believes the Florida legislature 
should stop misusing funds set 
aside for affordable housing.
While Kaimowitz believes 
there is no way to have affordable 
housing in Gainesville, Henry said 
that it simply needs to be located in places other than east Gainesville. 
Following the forum, community 
members spoke one-on-one to 
candidates. 
Mary Alford, a candidate for the 
District 1 seat of the Alachua County 
Commission, was in attendance at 
the Tuesday forum. She believes 
the topics were all relevant to the 
Gainesville community but was 
disappointed to see no enthusiasm 
for the renter’s rights proposal.
To Alford, 58, the most 
significant issue is having a living 
wage because it has the biggest 
impact on everyday people’s lives. 
She said most candidates recognize 
the problem and proposed ideas 
to address it, such as focusing on 
transit options.
“I know who I’m not voting 
for,” she said.
@GrethelAguila
gaguila@alligator.orgtion Capital Overlay, $23.3 million from Herbert 
Wertheim, $13 million from the College of Engi-
neering and $3.6 million from UF. 
Levi said he wonders how the engineering 
building could be late and over budget.
“These are people who shouldn’t be making 
mistakes,” he said. “I don’t know how that is 
possible.”
Goh declined to answer any further ques-
tions about the progress of the project and said 
to reach out to the College of Design, Construc-
tion and Planning or to Orlando.
Orlando initially said he would be able to 
provide information about the progress; how-
ever, when asked to provide specific details, he 
declined to comment.
Because of that, The Alligator wasn’t able to 
immediately obtain the cost of the project since 
Orlando’s statement in April 2019.
The Alligator has public record requested in-
formation relating to the progress of the build-
ing. 
On the UF Laboratory for Engineering Excel-
lence’s website, there is supposed to be a week-
by-week progress video, although the last video 
update was posted on Aug. 7, 2019.In Goh’s statement, she said the building will 
provide many resources to UF’s engineering stu-
dents.
“It will house Computer Engineering, Florida 
Engineering Experiment Station (FLEX), Engi-
neering Innovation Institute (EII), Engineering 
Leadership Institute (ELI),” Goh wrote in an 
email. “It’ll also house freshman design labs 
and senior capstone design courses for all de-
partments and Faculty and student collaborator 
spaces.”
According to the website, the building will be 
84,000 square feet and will have a new biotech 
lab to help students come up with new solutions 
to overcome cancer and other diseases. The 
groundbreaking for the building began in 2016.
It also said that once the building is complete, 
the college can expect to see an increased num-
ber of start-ups and 300 more engineering de-
grees awarded annually. 
For Levi and other engineering students, he 
said he wonders whether the new building is 
worth it.
“I still want to see the lab get completed,” 
he said. “But I wonder if it was worth it given 
the cost and how long it has taken to come to 
fruition.”

LANEZ WAS PAID $91,500 
FOR HIS PERFORMANCE
By AJ Bafer
Alligator Contributing Writer
Lights dimmed down, hands 
were raised and the crowd turned 
up.
About 3,000 students gathered 
in the O’Connell Center Monday 
night to bop along with Canadian rap icon Tory Lanez and Georgia 
hip-hop trio Travis Porter. The 
show was hosted by UF Student 
Government Productions and UF’s 
Black Student Union in honor of 
Black History Month.
The artists were picked to per-
form based on their availability 
and feedback from UF’s communi-
ty, SGP chairman Jimmy Wheeler 
wrote in an email.
“Artist selection is dependent on input received from the SGP 
staff, other entities within SG, or-
ganizations that represent minor-
ity student organizations, as well 
as the student body as a whole,” 
Wheeler wrote.
According to his contract, Tory 
Lanez was paid $91,500 for his 
performance.
Spotlights came on right be-
fore 8 p.m. as Florida native DJ 
Koolaid, in a Gators hoodie, hyped 
up concertgoers with remixes 
of hits including Travis Scott’s 
“Sicko Mode.”
“I bleed orange and blue, man,” 
he said. “I’m a Gator until I die.”
Just after 8 p.m., the members 
of Travis Porter joined DJ Koolaid 
for their song “Walked In,” carry-
ing a Gators sweatshirt. The ven-
ue shook as the crowd sang along 
to songs including “Ayy Ladies” 
and “Go Shorty Go.” Phone lights 
waved as the trio dropped their 
sweatshirts and rapped “College 
Girl.” 
“Make some noise for Snap-
chat,” they said as they took pic-
tures with the front row.
The group and their DJ left 
chomping to the Gators ﬁ  ght song, and the crowd immediate-
ly began chanting Lanez’s 
name.
They were satisﬁ  ed at 9:20 
p.m. when Lanez stormed the 
stage to his song “All I Wan-
na Do,” bursting with energy 
as he jumped along with the 
crowd. Lanez led into his 
verse on 6ix9ine’s “Jackie 
Chan” and began calling out 
his fans by section, from right 
to left.
After working through old-
er hits including “LUV” and 
“Say It,” Lanez sang tracks 
off his newest album “Chix-
tape 5,” including “Beauty in 
the Benz.”
“Right now, you feel like you 
have no purpose and you feel like 
sometimes you don’t have the po-
tential to do what everyone else is 
doing,” Lanez said on stage. “That 
person is in this room, and you 
have the potential to be greater 
than me. Don’t ever forsake that 
feeling.”
Lanez ended his performance 
crowd surﬁ  ng, telling his fans he 
loved them to death.
Dominique Grifﬁ  n, a 22-year-old UF telecommunication senior, 
said she was really excited for the 
concert. She said she was antici-
pating Lanez performing his new 
album, and thinks he was a good 
pick for Black History Month.
“That’s my guy. He’s dope,” 
she said.

THE KNIGHTS WILL BE JOINED 
BY VIOLINIST GIL SHAHAM 
By Marlena Carrillo
Avenue Staff Writer
The Grammy-nominated orchestral 
collective The Knights will bring their tal-
ents to UF today.
The New York-based chamber orches-
tra will play at the Phillips Center for the 
Performing Arts today accompanied by 
violinist Gil Shaham. 
The performance, “The Kreutzer 
Project,” will be based loosely around 
Beethoven’s “Kreutzer Sonata” and will 
begin with a piece by solo violinist Colin 
Jacobsen.
Formed in 2007,  the orchestra has 
performed at renowned venues like Carn-
egie Hall and have collaborated with art-
ists such as Yo-Yo Ma and Shaham. They 
are featured on Shaham’s 2016 Grammy-
nominated release.
The Knights are dedicated to deliver-
ing a unique and emotional experience to 
their audience, Eric Jacobsen, co-founder 
and conductor, said.“We want to have a moment, whatev-
er that means,” the conductor said. “We 
want to have a moment onstage with the 
audience where people have a memory, 
they take something away.”
The Knights will be joined by Shaham, 
who won the 1999 Grammy Award for 
Best Chamber Music Performance and 
was also named Musical America’s “In-
strumentalist of the Year” in 2012.
Katy Pendleton, an 18-year-old UF 
music freshman, said a performance by a 
Grammy-nominated chamber orchestra is 
beneﬁ  cial to performing arts students who 
are building their talents.
“Listening to professional musicians 
can introduce us to new ways of phrasing 
pieces and expressing ourselves through 
our instruments as we ﬁ  nd our own indi-
vidual style,” Pendleton said.
The performance will take place at 7:30 
p.m. Tickets for UF students are $10 while 
regular tickets begin at $40 and can be 
bought on the UF Performing Arts web-
site.

THE GAINESVILLE INDIE-
POP BAND WILL RELEASE 
THEIR FIRST MUSIC OF 
2020
By Chloe Greenberg
Avenue Staff Writer
Gainesville band Driveaway is 
releasing its new single “I’m Scared 
and It’s Okay” Friday, a message on 
mental health awareness inspired 
by the instrumental power of a 
rusty old bike.
This will be the indie-pop band’s 
ﬁ  rst single released in 2020 follow-
ing the September release of “Com-
parisons.” 
The single is a reﬂ  ection of the 
struggles faced by those dealing 
with illness or mental health obsta-
cles, said Driveaway vocalist Tren-
ton Ropp.
“The basic message is just about 
the initial fear that you get when you’re diagnosed with a serious 
illness,” he said. “It’s our personal 
experience of the fear and ques-
tions that come with that, but being 
thankful that you’re at least feeling 
something instead of nothing.”
The band consists of guitar-
ist Kyle Tapley, drummer Andrew 
Mankin and brothers Tanner and 
Trenton Ropp, bassist and vocalist 
respectively. 
Tanner said he got the idea for 
“I’m Scared and It’s Okay” while 
riding his old bike home from 
class. The gears on the bike made 
a “weird, off-kilter sound” that 
helped him ﬁ  nd the low-tempo beat 
that started the song. 
“I think we tried to be a lot more 
patient with the writing,” the bass-
ist said. “It’s a bit more of a slow 
build than our other songs. It fo-
cuses more on allowing the lyrics to 
sort of freeze.”
The lyrics are inspired by some 
of Trenton’s own personal experi-ences with mental health, as well 
as the experiences of his bandmates 
and those around him. He said the 
lyrics are, or are inspired by, quotes 
he has said himself or has heard 
others express. 
“There’s nothing really poetic 
about the verses because they’re so 
straightforward,” Trenton said.
Recognizing that many students 
develop issues with mental health 
in college, the band wants listen-
ers to be met with a feeling of hope 
by the end of the song, which ends 
with the lyrics, “We’ll all be better 
soon.” 
“I’m excited because it’s such 
a patient song,” Trenton said. “It 
doesn’t rely on us playing it with 
super high energy, it relies on us 
delivering it with emotional sincer-
ity. We don’t have a lot of songs like 
that.”

FOR A WEEK, “THE NOTEBOOK” 
MEETS “JERSEY SHORE”
By Alyssa Archard
Avenue Staff Writer
Every year, millions of college students 
travel far and wide to take a weeklong break 
from responsibility. That’s right — we’re 
talking spring break. The lore surrounding 
this magical time of Spring semester has 
been explored through ﬁ  lm and, of course, 
YA romance novels. But do these idyllic sto-
rylines exist in the real world? For Camila Peralta, a 19-year-old UF 
anthropology freshman, the perfect spring 
break love story has not found its way into 
her life. Nevertheless, she still thinks it can 
happen and can be real “if you make it real.”
To her, any ﬂ  irty spring break story can 
become a reality.
“It’s just a matter of perception,” she 
said. “You can make up a whole romance in 
your head with a hot waiter or something, 
even though in reality, he just asked you if 
you want cheese or not.”
Life may not be a Nicholas Sparks novel 
after all, but some people really do have an 
exciting spring ﬂ  ing story.
Ariel Civelek, a 21-year-old UF business 
administration senior, said this week can 
certainly be reminiscent of romance novels. For her, it all started on the Monday of last 
year’s break. She met a charming college 
footballer at a nightclub in Fort Lauderdale, 
they exchanged contacts and before they 
knew it, they were frolicking on the beach 
together the next day. Not to mention every 
day after that. 
She told me that with the time limitation, 
the pressure you feel in any budding rela-
tionship melts away.
“It was deﬁ  nitely something different 
compared to an actual relationship,” she 
said. “It was literally fun. You didn’t have 
to stress about ‘Is this someone going to text 
me?’ because spring break is known just to 
have fun, and that’s literally what I did.”
When asked her about the time con-
straints spring break puts on a relationship, she said she found that it worked out per-
fectly for her. 
“I don’t have time when I go back to 
school to actually commit or hang out with 
a guy 24 hours of the day,” Civelek said. 
“Doing nothing for a whole week, it was a 
huge factor in growing a relationship that 
fast.”
When you mix together a ﬁ  nite span of 
time, zero cares in the world, sand and sun, 
a perfect cocktail is created that yields these 
types of stories every single year. With 
spring break merely days away, what will 
be your story?

MEN'S BASKETBALL
By Brendan Farrell
Sports Writer
With only a few days left in February 
and the end of the regular season looming 
in the distance, it’s once again Bracketol-
ogy season. 
ESPN’s Joe Lunardi currently projects 
the Gators as a No. 9 seed facing No. 8 
seed St. Mary’s in Sacramento, Califor-
nia in the first round. NCAA.com’s Andy 
Katz also has the Gators as a No. 9 seed, 
matching them with Houston as the No. 8 
seed in Omaha, Nebraska. 
They’re not alone, either. No matter 
who makes the projections, the Gators 
(17-10, 9-5 SEC) are a consensus No. 9 
seed. 
Bracketmatrix.com tracked 103 bracket 
projections this year, and the good news 
for Florida is that it is in all 103 brackets. 
The issue is that the Gators’ average seed 
is 9.12, with only a few projections mark-ing them as high as the eighth seed. 
Florida stands to benefit more from be-
ing a No. 7 or No. 10 seed because be-
ing an eighth or ninth is traditionally a 
death sentence. Matchups between the 
eighth and ninth seeds might as well be 
coin tosses, and a win only sets up a meet-
ing with the No. 1 seed, barring another 
UMBC-esque miracle. 
Eight and nine seeds have upset the 
top seed a combined 20 times in 135 at-
tempts since 1985 for a winning percent-
age of .148. No. 7 and No. 10 seeds fare 
much better in the second round, advanc-
ing to the Sweet Sixteen 36.8 percent of 
the time. 
Now, there is still plenty of time for 
things to change. Florida still has four 
games left in conference play, and three 
of them (LSU tonight, at Tennessee, 
Kentucky) are Quadrant 1 opportuni-
ties. Quadrant 1 games are any contests 
against teams in the top 30 of the NCAA’s NET rankings at home, top 50 at a neutral 
site or top 75 on the road. 
Florida, No. 33 in the NET rankings, 
is currently 5-8 in Quadrant 1 games this 
season, giving it an opportunity to go .500 
against a difficult schedule in a best-case 
scenario. 
The Gators will have additional op-
portunities to improve their resume in the 
SEC Tournament. UF is currently fourth in 
the SEC standings, giving it the opportuni-
ty of not having to play until the third day 
of the tournament. Five SEC teams are in 
the top 50 of the NET rankings, potentially 
opening the door to another Quadrant 1 
game. 
The point is that Florida should avoid 
finishing as a eighth or a ninth seed. So, 
in the case of things going awry, losing 
might not be the worst thing to happen to 
the Gators.

LACROSSE
By Christian Ortega 
Sports Writer
The Gators dropped to eighth in the most recent Inside La-
crosse Maverik Women’s Division I Media Poll after their 17-6 
drubbing at the hands of Loyola-Maryland Saturday at home.
Against the 10th-ranked Greyhounds, the only two catego-
ries UF had the advantage in were draw controls (13) and fouls 
(26), the latter of which told the tale of Florida’s frustrations 
as it couldn’t mount a comeback. Today at 11 a.m., it will play 
the Owls, the first unranked team it has faced this season. 
Following Saturday’s game, coach Amanda O’Leary spoke 
on how she wants the team to generate consistent offense be-
yond the production of junior midfielder Shannon Kavanagh. 
The midfielder's 14 goals have accounted for 44 percent of all 
the team’s goals scored this season. Behind her is redshirt junior midfielder Brianna Harris who 
has scored 10 goals this season, 31 percent of the team’s total. 
It’s not an attribution to lack of talent, as Florida’s under-
classmen did well to score in the first two games. Rather its 
young roster still has room to grow. As O’Leary put it, it’s a 
matter of confidence for the team to have while cutting toward 
the goal. 
The offense should improve that confidence against an 
Owls’ defense that is allowing 14 goals per game through its 
first two contests. KSU goalie Alex Bunn is averaging 10 saves 
per game and saves 42 percent of her shots. 
An added bonus for the Gators is they commit 10.33 turn-
overs per game, fourth in the NCAA. It is an advantage against 
a Kennesaw State team, which causes six turnovers per game, 
ranking 104th nationally. 
Defensively, UF will be tasked with stopping sisters Sienna and Marissa Gore, who have combined for 17 points through 
KSU’s first two games. It will be up to the trio of defenders, 
starting with senior Cara Trombetta, junior Kaitlyn Dabkowski 
and freshman Becky Browndorf to ease the pressure for red-
shirt freshman goalkeeper Sarah Reznick, whose 45 percent 
save percentage ranks 52nd nationally. 
O’Leary knows there’s work to be done before the team 
finds its potential. After the loss, she spoke about using each 
game as a learning opportunity. With 14 games left on the 
season, including today’s, Florida has a wealth of opportuni-
ties to improve, while testing itself against some of the nation’s 
stiffest competition. This includes Saturday’s matchup against 
No. 3 Stony Brook.

The Gators will have to wait 
another 24 hours before their first 
game as the nation’s No. 1 team.
Florida’s home contest against 
Florida A&M scheduled for Tues-
day night was postponed due to 
inclement weather, according to 
a release. No makeup date has 
been announced as of yet, but the 
two teams are still set to meet on 
March 4 in Gainesville.
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan and 
his squad now shift their focus 
to tonight’s opponent, as UF goes 
on the road to take on Stetson at Melching Field in DeLand, Florida.
The Hatters (6-1) have gotten 
off to a much-improved start this 
season after losing five straight 
games to open the 2019 campaign.
Last week, they edged out a 
6-5 victory over Central Florida. 
It was a telling triumph for Stet-
son, with the Knights making their 
way to the No. 21 spot in Base-
ball America’s rankings after UCF 
swept then-No. 12 Auburn over 
the weekend.
If Stetson’s midweek bout with 
UCF is any indication of who will 
pitch on Wednesday, then it's 
likely that UF will face right-hand-
er Danny Garcia at some point throughout the night.
The sophomore earned his 
first collegiate start against Cen-
tral Florida, giving up two earned 
runs on four hits in five innings of 
work.
Garcia appeared on the mound 
in 28 games last season and fin-
ished with a 5-1 record with a 1.22 
ERA in 59 innings. 
The righty will be an interest-
ing test for UF’s batters if he pitch-
es. They have racked up 85 hits 
(tied for 10th in the nation) and 65 
runs (12th in the nation) through 
the first eight games of the season.
Outfielders Jacob Young and 
Jud Fabian are at the forefront of Florida’s high-octane offense 
with a .407 and .342 batting av-
erage, respectively. They are the 
only players who have registered 
double-digit hits for the Gators so 
far this year.
Florida’s starting pitcher for 
Wednesday’s game has not been 
announced.
The postponement of Tues-
day’s game against the 1-5 Rat-
tlers gives the Hatters a chance at 
becoming the first team to upset 
the nation’s top-ranked team, so 
the Gators will be playing with a 
target on their backs tonight.

The Gators survived a college softball gauntlet 
last weekend. 
In fact, they thrived. They emerged from Palm 
Springs, California, Sunday with a 4-1 record against 
four top-25 teams in the Mary Nutter Collegiate 
Classic after forcing No. 1 UCLA to extra innings. 
As a result, Florida (16-2) earned the No. 6 slot in 
the NFCA Coaches’ poll released Tuesday. 
“For us, it’s about being consistent...being able 
to go out and perform at your best,” coach Tim Wal-
ton said.
The four runs the Gators hung on the Bruins in 
the one-run loss was tied for the most runs UCLA 
has allowed all season. 
Walton seemed disappointed in the team’s de-
fensive showing in that game, however, comparing 
it to the Gators’ only other loss this season against then-No. 11 Michigan. UF notched a season-high 
three errors in the 11-2 loss.
While Florida only had two mishaps against 
UCLA, that’s enough to indicate a trend in Walton’s 
book. More than half of its errors on the season 
came in those two matchups. 
After years of relying on defensive strategy, ad-
ditions to UF’s lineup have transformed its style of 
play and allowed newer players to shine in orange 
and blue.
“We’ve had some really good at-bats from Bay-
lee Goddard, really good at-bats from Julia Cottrill, 
Charla Echols, Jade Caraway, Cheyenne Lindsey,” 
Walton said.
Hannah Adams, the leadoff batter, has noticed 
the evolution of Florida’s offense.
“We have a lot more diversity in our lineup than 
we’ve had in the past,” the junior said. “There’s 
people that slap, people that are fast, people that hit 
home runs.”Adams played an integral role on the West 
Coast, including her second walk-off hit of the sea-
son to seal the victory against Northwestern Friday 
night. Adams has been big on continually building 
her self-assurance at the plate and shared her mind-
set at that moment.
“It’s important to just be yourself and don’t let 
the moment get too big,” she said. 
After hitting just three home runs all of last sea-
son, Adams has two already this year. She said that 
a new mentality has allowed her to maximize her 
impact in the batter’s box.
“I think (I’m) going up there every time with in-
tent to do damage on the ball,” she said. “At times 
last year, it was more of just trying to make contact.”
Moving forward, Florida’s ﬁ  rst series of the sea-
son against No. 10 Louisiana Lafayette begins Fri-
day at 6 p.m. at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.

ptitus@alligator.orgTournament time over, series now start for UF
MEN’S BASKETBALL

The margin of error for the Gators is 
shrinking.
UF (17-10, 9-5 SEC) isn’t in a bad posi-
tion when it comes to the NCAA Tourna-
ment and the loss to Kentucky on Saturday 
did nothing to change that.
However, Florida missed out on a gold-
en opportunity to secure its standing in the 
March Madness ﬁ  eld.
Now, with four regular season games 
remaining, coach Mike White and his team 
understand there’s little room for mistakes 
down the stretch.
“Our guys know the big picture. They 
know it,” White said at Tuesday’s media 
availability. “I told them yesterday, for prob-
ably the third or fourth time, our spectrum is 
we could potentially make a big run in the 
NCAA Tournament or we could potentially 
not go to the NCAA Tournament.”Right now, according to multiple media 
outlets, the Gators are on the right side of the 
bubble, and a victory over another potential 
NCAA Tournament team in LSU (19-8, 10-4 
SEC) tonight would make their standing 
even stronger.
When Florida and LSU met on Jan. 21, 
the Tigers outmuscled the Gators in the in-
terior, edging UF on the boards 38-28 and 
beating it 50-32 in the paint.
That’ll have to change at the O’Connell 
Center on Wednesday night if the home 
team hopes to secure a victory over one of 
the best teams in the SEC.
The Tigers have lost four out of six, but 
it’s not because of a lack of offense.
LSU has the second-best scoring offense 
in the SEC at 80.8 points per game and has 
averaged over 84 PPG during its 2-4 stretch 
in the past few weeks.
The Tigers have ﬁ  ve players that average 
double ﬁ  gures, and that’s a big reason de-
fenses have had issues guarding them.Florida has to be disciplined and keep 
Kerry Blackshear Jr. and center Omar Payne 
on the ﬂ  oor to help contain LSU forwards 
Trendon Watford and Darius Days, who had 
a combined 24 points and 14 rebounds in 
the team’s ﬁ  rst meeting.
On the opposite end, the Tigers have 
been vulnerable on defense, giving up 73.2 
PPG, placing them 281st in the NCAA.
UF shot well in the ﬁ  rst matchup, making 
11 threes in a two-point defeat.
The last four contests between the teams 
have been decided by ﬁ  ve points or less, 
with two going to overtime.
Tonight should harbor another high-scor-
ing, neck-and-neck battle.
“We control our destiny, and that’s like 
a luxury we have as a team,” Blackshear Jr. 
said. “We can decide whether we want to 
maybe ﬁ  nish out in the NIT or make a run in 
the NCAA Tournament.”
