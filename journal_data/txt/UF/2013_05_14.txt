Students with nontraditional parents 
who live together must report both parents’ 
income and other ﬁ  nancial information on 
their 2014-2015 Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid (FAFSA).
The application will now use terms like “Parent 1 (father/mother/stepparent)” and 
“Parent 2 (father/mother/stepparent)” in-
stead of gender-speciﬁ  c labels, according to a press release.
Students can also list their parents’ mari-
tal status as “unmarried and both parents liv-
ing together.”
Director of UF’s Ofﬁ  ce for Student Finan-cial Affairs Rick Wilder said in a phone interview 
that he doesn’t anticipate a lot of UF students will be impacted.
“The number of students 
who come from situations like that at UF would be relatively small,” he said.
Wilder said the FAFSA change targets un-
married parents. Under the old FAFSA rules, applicants only had to report one income if 
their parents weren’t married but were living 
together.
FAFSA submission is required for stu-
dents to be eligible for Bright Futures schol-
arships.
In a press release, U.S. Secretary of Edu-
cation Arne Duncan said the changes would 
allow for a more precise calculation of federal student aid eligibility.

UF is ofﬁ  cially a preeminent 
university.
The Florida Legislature, 
whose session ended May 3, 
passed legislation that not only 
recognizes UF as a preeminent 
school in the State University System but also designates funding for certain projects.
Gov. Rick Scott signed the 
preeminence bill into law on April 22. It provides $75 mil-lion — $15 million a year for ﬁ  ve years — to help UF in its 
quest to become a top 10 public university, according to a legis-lative session summary on the 
Gators for Higher Education website. UF will match that amount through private fund-raising.
The preeminence law essen-
tially beefs up UF’s faculty and its resources, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said Monday.
“The vision is to use it to 
augment our faculty with some world-class additions,” she said.
Preeminence doesn’t auto-
matically equal top 10 status, though.
“There’s no one single thing 
that the university can do to 
help ascend in the ranks,” Sikes 
said. “It’s going to take a board-Legislature helps

Punk rock fans are already preparing to 
rock longer at this year’s Fest.
In an effort to cater to out-of-towners and 
extend the event’s scope, organizers of the 
Gainesville-based music festival announced the 12th annual Fest will begin with a pre-party in Ybor City this year, extending the 
festival by two days.
It will run the standard four days in 
Gainesville, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 3. The pre-
party in Ybor City – added this year – will be Oct. 29-30, offering shows by many of the 
same bands at discounted prices.
Fest organizer Tony Weinbender said 
adding the days to the front end made sense 
because it catered to out-of-towners who of-
ten arrive early anyway.
“A lot are from overseas, coming as early 
as Wednesday,” he said. “That was an easy 
move to extend it.”
Weinbender also said coordinating logis-
tics in Tampa was a natural choice because the circles of people often already overlap.
“The Tampa music scene is very close to 
the Gainesville scene,” he said.The out-of-town pre-party also solved lo-
gistical issues with booking local venues for longer, Weinbender said.
“Taking over venues for six days wouldn’t work in Gainesville,” he said.
Pat Lavery, who handles booking for Fest 
venue High Dive, said the Fest extension could present pros and cons locally because business is more spread out.
“Now, it appears Fest goers will have 
two or three times the number of options,” he said in an email interview. “If it means a lower turnout for the Fest in Gainesville and 
smaller crowds for each participating venue, 
then that could mean a negative ﬁ  nancial impact to the Gainesville community.”Fest 2013 announces extended dates, multiple cities2014-2015 applicants affectedSEE UNIVERSITY, PAGE 4

East about to be overrun by billions of cicadas
WASHINGTON — Any day 
now, billions of cicadas with bulg-ing red eyes will crawl out of the earth after 17 years underground and will overrun the East Coast. The insects will arrive in such numbers that people from North Carolina to Connecticut will be outnumbered roughly 600-to-1. Maybe more.
Scientists even have a horror-
movie name for the infestation: Brood II. But as ominous as that sounds, the insects are harmless. They won’t hurt you or other animals. At worst, they might damage a few saplings or young shrubs. Mostly they will blan-ket certain pockets of the region, though lots of people won’t ever see them.
“It’s not like these hordes of 
cicadas suck blood or zombify people,” says May Berenbaum, a University of Illinois entomolo-gist.
They’re looking for just one 
thing: sex. And they’ve been wait-ing quite a long time.
Since 1996, this group of 1-inch 
bugs, in wingless nymph form, has been a few feet underground, sucking on tree roots and biding their time. They will emerge only when the ground temperature reaches precisely 64 degrees. Af-ter a few weeks up in the trees, they will die and their offspring will go underground, not to re-turn until 2030.
“It’s just an amazing accom-
plishment,” Berenbaum says. “How can anyone not be im-pressed?”
And they will make a big rack-
et, too. The noise all the male cica-das make when they sing for sex can drown out your own thought and maybe even rival a rock con-cert. In 2004, Gene Kritsky, an entomologist at the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati, measured cicadas at 94 decibels, saying it was so loud “you don’t hear planes flying overhead.”
There are ordinary cicadas 
that come out every year around the world, but these are different. just how these bugs know it’s been 17 years, not 15 or 16 years, and it’s time to come out. 
“These guys have evolved sev-
eral mathematically clever tricks,” Raupp says. “These guys are ge-niuses with little tiny brains.”
Past cicada invasions have 
seen as many as 1.5 million bugs per acre. Of course, most places along the East Coast won’t be so swamped, and some places, espe-cially in cities, may see zero, says Chris Simon of the University of Connecticut. For example, Staten Island gets this brood of cicadas but the rest of New York City and Long Island don’t, she says. The cicadas also live beneath the metro areas of Philadelphia, Bal-timore and Washington.
While they stay underground, 
the bugs aren’t asleep. As some of the world’s longest-lived insects, they go through different growth stages and molt four times before ever getting to the surface. They feed on a tree fluid called xy-
lem. Then they go aboveground, 
where they molt, leaving behind 
a crusty brown shell and grow a 
half-inch bigger.

as in magic — and are red-eyed. And these magicicadas are seen only in the eastern half of the United States and nowhere else in the world.
There are 15 U.S. broods that 
emerge every 13 or 17 years, so that nearly every year, some place is overrun. Last year it was a small area, mostly around the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. Next year, two plac-es get hit: Iowa into Illinois and Missouri; and Louisiana and Mississippi. And it’s possible to live in these locations and actu-ally never see them.
This year’s invasion, Brood 
II, is one of the bigger ones. Several experts say that they really don’t have a handle on how many cicadas are lurking underground, but 30 billion seems like a good estimate. At the Smithsonian Institution, re-searcher Gary Hevel thinks it 
may be more like 1 trillion.
Even if it’s merely 30 billion, 
if they were lined up head to 
tail, they’d reach the moon and back.
“There will be some places 
where it’s wall-to-wall cicadas,” 
says University of Maryland en-
tomologist Mike Raupp.
Strength in numbers is the 
key to cicada survival: There are 
so many of them that the birds 
can’t possibly eat them all, and 
those that are left over are free to multiply, Raupp says.
But why only every 13 or 
17 years? Some scientists think 
they come out in these odd 
cycles so that predators can’t match the timing and be wait-ing for them in huge numbers. 
Another theory is that the un-
usual cycles ensure that differ-
ent broods don’t compete with each other much.
And there’s the mystery of

MEET THE FLETCHERS
CHARMAINE MILLER
Alligator Staff Writer
After a quarter-century of stop-
and-go studies at UF, a married cou-
ple turned their tassels and walked across the stage in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center to receive their 
bachelor’s degrees.
As Ian and Patrice Fletcher, 44 
and 43, received their diplomas May 
5, friends and family gathered to cheer them on. Their 4-year-old son, Joshua, watched from his wheel-chair.
The two met a week before Val-
entine’s Day at a UF Caribbean 
Students Association party in 1989. 
They started dating at the end of the semester.
During the summer, Ian Fletcher 
spent some weekends driving to New York to visit Patrice.“I was out of my mind. I was 
crazy,” he said. By November, they 
were married.
The photographer lost all of the 
wedding photos except one. It was 
the one that counted, Patrice Fletch-er said. They were pictured standing together at the church altar.
The newlyweds jumped back 
into studies at UF and tried to main-tain their active student lives. She 
pledged with a sorority and juggled 
three jobs while he struggled with test anxiety. Ian Fletcher recalled his mind going blank in a statistics exam. In another math class, he failed the first three exams.
He left school to take a break and 
she left nursing school in 1993 for a store management position.
“Back then, what we were going 
through we thought was difficult,” she said. “So we gave up.”
They had a daughter, Julia, in 
2000. Their son, Joshua, followed eight years later. But three weeks after Joshua’s birth, Ian and Patrice Fletcher noticed he held his hands strangely. They took him to doctors to be tested, and he was diagnosed with a rare condition called spinal muscular atrophy.
Joshua’s brain functions normal-
ly, but he can only move his eyes. However, his sense of feeling is un-affected, and he can feel kisses from his mother and father. He points his eyes toward the top of his blue-framed glasses for “yes,” and to the side for “no.”
Although he had returned to his 
studies at UF in 2007, Ian Fletcher 
withdrew for the second time to 
tend to family responsibilities.“We had to learn everything …
literally how to become medical as-
sociates for Joshua care,” Ian Fletch-
er said.
He returned to UF in the summer 
of 2009 to study sports radio and get into film scriptwriting. He was also working full time.
When Patrice Fletcher came back 
to school in 2010, she said she expe-rienced a significant technology gap. As other students pounded out class notes on laptops, she said she could barely keep up handwriting from the PowerPoint slides. But she kept the new degree in recreation, parks 
and tourism in sight, and she pulled 
her GPA up from below a 2.0.
Now, she’s focusing on her son’s 
condition, and her husband now serves as vice president of workforce development for the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce.
At the close of their college jour-
ney, the Fletchers are still there to 
support each other. They have a 
faith to keep them strong — the Fletchers started a small church last year called Trinity Assembly Dream Center. And they agree they’ve ma-tured in more ways than one.
“That’s why this graduation to 
us is so fulfilling,” Patrice Fletcher said.

A Gainesville man was arrested 
Thursday night on charges of at-
tempting to stab his aunt and uncle when they refused to give him extra cash.
According to an Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office arrest report, John Samuel, 49, became violent because his aunt, Violet Brown, refused to give him more than $25. Samuel told Brown he was using cocaine, and Brown said she worried her 
nephew would use the extra money 
for drugs, according to the report.
Around 11:45 p.m., Samuel 
grabbed his aunt’s purse and tried to run from the house, which is lo-cated in the 600 block of NE 16th Terrace. The two struggled over the the purse.
Samuel reached for a butter knife — which his aunt 
and uncle used to lock the back 
door latch — and 
began to swing it above his head in a stabbing motion, accord-ing to the report. Samuel’s uncle, 
Samuel Henry Brown, knocked the knife from his hand, and all three re-sumed wrestling over the purse. 
When officers arrived, John 
Samuel resisted arrest and reached 
for an officer’s gun holster before he 
was handcuffed. According to the report, John Samuel candidly told a transport officer that he used crack and had a pipe for smoking it on him. Later, at the Alachua County Jail, staff found a glass pipe tucked in his sock. He also said he was try-ing to get ahold of the officer’s gun so he could shoot someone.  
John Samuel was charged with 
first-degree robbery with a weapon, 
and third-degree charges of aggra-
vated assault, resisting an officer with violence and smuggling con-traband. He was booked into the Alachua County Jail on Friday and remained as of press time with a bond of $250,000.

land@alligator.org.
As for drawing attendees away from Gainesville, Weinbender 
said he’s not worried. For many, he said, rocking at Fest in its city 
of origin is one of a kind.
“People like the experience,” he said. “It’s kind of a rite of pas-
sage.”
For the last 12 years, Fest has been booking multiple venues for 
the historically four-day festival where more than 100 independent punk-rock style bands take the stage. Concerts take place in bars, 
restaurants and even houses, and many participants fly in from 
overseas to attend. It was originally organized by independent re-cord label No Idea Records.

campus April 12. The sign has since been removed.

In a less-traveled corner of the UF 
campus, something smelled funny. A 
sign that read “SEWAGE SPILL AREA/DO NOT ENTER/STAY OUT OF WA-TER” was removed from the side of 
Surge Area Drive last week, according 
to UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
However, she said, the most recent 
spills in that area of campus happened in the  Fall, and there haven’t been any 
since.
Surge Area Drive runs between Ar-
cher Road and Hull Road in the south-
west corner of campus, winding by Steinmetz Hall — the entomology and nematology department — and Donald R. Dizney Lacrosse Stadium near the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts . The sign was at the Archer Road end near a wooded area.
Florida Department of Environmen-
tal Protection records confirm about 5,000 gallons of wastewater did in fact spill near the sign’s location  Oct. 17, 
and there was an earlier spill of about 
3,000 gallons much closer to the sign Sept. 11.
Gainesville Regional Utilities spokes-
man Dan Jesse was only made aware of the sign recently, and he said he thought it was hard to believe it had been left there since October.
“If there was a sign, and none of our 
people noticed it, someone just forgot to take it down, I guess,” Jesse said.
Sikes said the Physical Plant Divi-
sion told her it was unaware of the sign as well and removed it after an inquiry about this story.
The Environmental Protection Agen-
cy defines wastewater as “the spent or used water from a home, community, 
farm, or industry that contains dis-
solved or suspended matter,” which can include raw sewage.

Reduced class sizes are one of the goals
sustained effort to do quite a few things...this is a couple of big pieces toward that goal.”
Reduced class sizes and better 
research and technology transfer ca-
pabilities are two of the university’s 
initiatives, according to an email sent by C. David Brown II, the chair-man of the UF Board of Trustees.
“UF students will get higher 
quality faculty going forward and hopefully some smaller classes,” Sikes said.
The Florida Legislature also al-
located $15 million toward the cre-ation of a new chemistry building on UF’s campus. The existing building is outdated and ill-equipped to meet the demands of students, Sikes said.
The preeminence designation 
also means UF can create programs to deliver online bachelor’s degrees, according to Brown’s email.
However, news coming out of the 
legislative session wasn’t all good. The legislature did not approve a re-quest to bond money underwritten by student capital improvement fees that would have gone toward phase two of the Reitz Union makeover and Newell Hall renovation.
“It is my understanding that 
Newell Hall is off,” Sikes said.
Other decisions made by the leg-
islature include a pay raise for uni-versity employees and $500,000 to the McKnight Brain Institute to fund the Brain Tumor Registry.
In addition, the legislature autho-
rized a 3 percent increase in tuition. But Scott has yet to approve the bud-get. His deadline is May 24.
“We’re still waiting and watch-
ing,” Sikes said.

UF is now home to Florida’s most powerful 
computer.
On May 7, the university unveiled HiPer-
Gator, a supercomputer capable of 150 trillion 
calculations per second. About 70 people at-
tended the unveiling. The supercomputer is 
housed in the new 25,000-square-foot UF Data Center, at 2008 NE Waldo Road, which was built in part to house the machine.
“HiPerGator is the crowning piece of an 
overall strategy to bring the university’s re-search computer environment to the top-10 level,” said Erik Deumens, director of research computing at UF.
When that strategy began to take shape in 
2004 it did not initially include a supercom-puter, Deumens said.
“We basically said, ‘the university needs 
this much computing power.’ It just happened to be in the range of a supercomputer,” he said.
To build the $3.4 million supercomputer, the university collaborated with Advanced Micro Devices, Dell, Mellanox Technologies and Terascala. HiPerGator’s 16,384 process-ing cores give it the computing power of more than 4,000 desktop computers, Deumens said.
He said the supercomputer will be used primarily for data-intensive research, includ-ing gene sequencing, weather modeling and analysis of chemical structures.
UF physics professor Paul Avery, chair 
of the Research Computing Advisory Com-mittee, said the increased computing power would be immensely helpful in his work. Av-
ery is part of a group of UF researchers that 
helped confirm the Higgs boson.
Although some will get more use out of 
HiPerGator than others, Deumens said any re-searcher at the university can access it.
“We focused this machine to be for every-
body at UF,” he said. HiPerGator supercomputer makes its debut at university

of an overall strategy to bring the

CAPE CANAVERAL — In a 
high-flying, perfectly pitched first, 
an astronaut on the International Space Station is bowing out of or-bit with a musical video: his own 
custom version of David Bowie’s 
“Space Oddity.”
It’s believed to be the first music 
video made in space, according to NASA.
Canadian astronaut Chris Had-
field’s personalized rendition of “Space Oddity” was posted on YouTube on Sunday, one day be-
fore his departure from the orbit-
ing lab. He’s wrapping up a five-month mission that began last December.
His return aboard a Russian 
Soyuz capsule, along with Ameri-can Thomas Marshburn and Rus-sian Roman Romanenko, was set for late Monday in Kazakhstan.
Hadfield, 53, a longtime gui-
tarist who played in an astronaut rock ‘n’ roll band, recorded the video throughout the space sta-tion. He had some down-to-Earth help from a Canadian music team.
“With deference to the genius of 
David Bowie, here’s Space Oddity, recorded on Station. A last glimpse 
of the World,” Hadfield said via 
Twitter.
The spaceman altered some of 
the lyrics of Bowie’s 1969 version, singing “Planet Earth is blue and there’s nothing left to do.” The Bowie version goes “... and there’s nothing I can do.” And instead of “Take your protein pills and put 
your helmet on,” it became, “Lock 
your Soyuz hatch and put your helmet on.”
Planet Earth provided a stun-
ning backdrop for many of the scenes.“It’s just been an extremely 
fulfilling and amazing experience end to end,” Hadfield told Mission Control on Monday. “We’re, of course, focusing very much on fly-ing the Soyuz home now and look-ing forward to seeing everybody 
face to face. But from this Cana-
dian to all the rest of them, I offer an enormous debt of thanks.” He was referring to all those in the Ca-nadian Space Agency who helped make his flight possible.
Hadfield, an 
engineer and 
former test pilot 
from Milton, On-
tario, was Cana-da’s first profes-sional astronaut to live aboard the space station and became the 
first Canadian in charge of a space-craft. He relinquished command of 
the space station on Sunday.
He sang often in orbit, using a 
guitar already aboard the complex, 
and even took part in a live, Cana-dian coast-to-coast concert in Feb-ruary that included the Barenaked Ladies’ Ed Robertson and a youth choir, and featured the song I.S.S., “Is Somebody Singing?”
I.S.S. is NASA’s acronym for 
the International Space Station.
Also last February, Hadfield 
joined the Irish band The Chieftains and two ground-bound astronauts in a Houston concert, singing the lead on “Moondance.”
The five-minute video posted 
Sunday drew a salute from Bow-
ie’s official Facebook page: “It’s 
possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created.”
NASA broadcast the video on 
its daily space station update late Monday morning.Astronaut exits space

Summer in Gainesville means fewer people, hotter tempera-

to catch a ride.
Although normal summer schedules resumed Monday, routes 
22, 27, 28, 29, 39, 46, 62 and 76 will be suspended and Later Gator

UF Carillon is the sound of the campus
It’s a tired topic, but it’s one that still enslaves the 
minds of people with good imaginations or memo-ries. It’s called ephemerality. 
It’s the notion that even the present is the immediate 
past.  It’s the idea that what you have will be lost before you know it.
In its shadow, we are burdened with the task of tak-
ing advantage of the time that we have. We are forced to be productive.
Take college for example. In about four years, we 
have to set the foundations for our professional lives. We need to decide what we want professionally first. 
We must figure out our socio-political identities, and 
most fleeting of all, forge some of the best memories we are likely to collect in our entire existences.
It’s no wonder the UF freshman preview orientation 
offers us the F Book, which is full of activities for stu-dents to accomplish before leaving our alma mater. I’ll admit I originally thought it was kind of gimmicky. I assumed UF hands students these mass-produced ex-periences so those students can be counted on to donate 
money after graduation as an expression of their grati-
tude — not that there is anything wrong with that.
But I guess I now like to think of the F Book as just a 
starting point for those who would otherwise feel alien-
ated in this bulky university.
Granted, students usually find there is, in fact, too 
much to do. 
There are more than 975 registered student organiza-
tions, more gyms than I’ve bothered counting, at least as many restaurants and a smorgasbord of department-
run activities geared at expanding our horizons.
Even then, in the ruckus of our lives here, how can 
we prioritize the more charming activities this campus 
has to offer? 
I guess the F Book might not be a bad place to start.
Some of my favorite places at UF are listed there. 
There’s Lake Alice, the Bat House and the Baughman Center. 
My personal favorite is Century Tower.There’s not much on the inside. It looks like 11.5 
levels of basement — 12.5 levels if you count the ac-tual basement — along with another couple of stories 
of belfry that no one ever gets to see because of safety 
regulations.
Still, the magic of Century Tower is not how it looks 
but how it sounds. In that belfry are 61 finely tuned 
bronze bells flown in from the Netherlands as part of an 
instrument called the carillon. And those who play this instrument, which is activated from the 11th floor by a wooden console, participate in a tradition that stretches back before the onset of the iPod and public radio.
It’s a fun and eclectic constant 
in our little world of imperma-nence.
I started off as a freshman at 
UF, listening to every afternoon recital performed from Century 
Tower. 
And although the carillonneurs didn’t play much 
popular music — because of copyright restrictions and 
the temperament of the instrument — their performanc-
es left me with a new kind of enchantment. To me, it was the sound of the UF campus.
I was lucky enough to audition and become a mem-
ber of the UF Carillon Studio for a while and play the bells myself. And just like most people find their niche on campus, the studio became mine.
Now that I’ve left, I can say for sure how special it 
was. There is nothing like leaving class and listening 
to a recital in the open air in the heat of summer or the 
cold of winter. There is nothing like falling asleep un-der a tree to your own personal serenade or waking up to haunting, thunderous chords beaten out of tons of 
bronze hundreds of feet above you.
Before you know it, it is gone, just like every other 
moment in your life. But at least it sets the tone. It reso-
nates.

During the weekend, network television compa-
nies slashed their schedules of many programs to make way for this week’s upfronts. This is an 
annual tradition where networks preview new shows 
to secure coveted advertising dollars from companies. 
NBC in particular is depending upon these new shows 
to bring in the money — the network nearly obliterated its comedy lineup, leaving only two shows, “Commu-nity” and “Parks and Recreation,” coming back next sea-
son — but will these efforts be enough to keep the dying 
industry afloat?
For years, the landscape of television has been 
changing. Ratings for network television have steadily 
dropped as competition from cable networks became 
increasingly popular. AMC’s “The Walking Dead” was 
the most-watched series on cable and broadcast televi-
sion for adults under 50. History’s “The Bible” closely followed “The Walking Dead” in total-viewer numbers. Dramas continue to flourish on cable while shows like 
ABC’s “Last Resort,” a series with a strong, compelling, 
original premise, failed to find an audience. Viewers will 
go wherever the best content is, and right now, the best shows are cable shows.
Comedies aren’t faring very well either. After this 
season is over, some of the biggest network comedies, 
such as “30 Rock” and “The Office,” will be gone. FOX’s 
“New Girl” and “The Mindy Project” both dipped in recent ratings. Times are tough for network comedies as many shows aren’t given the chance to flourish and 
establish themselves, getting canceled due to low ratings 
despite comedic strength. ABC’s “Happy Endings” was 
particularly difficult to see get the cut as it continued its tradition of being the best show no one was watching, but hopes that it will be picked up by a cable network like “Cougar Town” could signal a steady shift of sit-coms flourishing on cable the way dramas already do.
Technology is making it increasingly difficult for net-
works to secure advertising money as it becomes easier to 
watch shows on one’s own schedule. Services like Hulu 
and Netflix make it unnecessary to watch programs 
when they first air, decreasing a show’s live viewership and making it less valuable to spend money to adver-tise during the show. DVRs allow you record shows and 
watch them whenever you want without watching any 
of the commercials. Because of this, networks are strug-
gling to find ways to monetize their investments. First-quarter profits at ABC fell 40 percent from last year to 
$138 million, while NBC lost $35 
million in profits during the same 
period. As viewership declines, it 
will only become more difficult to get advertisers to spend their money on network television. 
CBS bucks these trends, holding onto strong ratings 
that other networks can’t seem to find. What’s the dif-ference between the strongest network, CBS, and the weakest, NBC? While NBC cancels many of its shows, CBS renews its shows. Over time, their programming 
has gained the loyalty and viewership only time can 
give you.
All indications point to network television being an 
industry in decline. Networks need to adapt to technol-
ogy to stay relevant and increase profits. Most impor-
tantly though, networks need to find high quality pro-
gramming to produce and let it stay on air long enough 
for audiences to grow.

After entering its first singing 
competition, a local barbershop 
quartet considers itself FOURTU-
NATE.
Competing at the International 
Quartet Preliminaries and District 
Chorus Convention in Orlando last month, the four-man harmo-nies of FOURTUNATE earned the group seventh place out of 17 
quartets.
As it was their first competition 
together, C.J. Shaw, 26, Bob Tuck-
er, 57, Mike Roth, 61, and Tyson 
Adams, 46, were happy to have 
placed in the top 10.
The competition was split over two days, and FOURTUNATE went to Orlando with one goal: to become International Quartet Pre-
liminary Finalists and qualify to 
sing both days.
C.J. Shaw, a music freshman at 
Santa Fe College, said he jumped 
out of his seat when he heard the 
news.
“I was so excited,” he said. “The whole audience could hear me.”
Perhaps it was the hours of 
practice the group put in every 
Sunday paying off, but Shaw said 
he spikes his hair with gel and drinks a Powerade for good luck.
At the competition, FOURTU-
NATE sang “Wait Till the Sun Shines Nellie,” “The Story of the Rose (Heart of My Heart),” “Old St. Louie” and “Bye Bye Blues” in front of a crowd of about 1,000 
people.
Scores were based on singing, 
presentation and the categories of 
music.
Bob Tucker, a UF accounting 
instructor and the baritone of the group, said he knew their group could be successful the moment they first sang together.
They all became acquainted 
through the BarberGators barber-shop chorus in Gainesville. The four men sang together randomly 
at a chapter meeting and liked 
what they heard.
“I remember that magical mo-
ment,” Tucker said.
In October 2012, they became 
an official quartet.
Although they are a relative-
ly new group, each member of FOURTUNATE has had outside 
signing experience separately.
Shaw, the youngest of the 
group, began barbershop singing 
at the age of 16. Performing for so long, Shaw said he has outgrown stage fright.
“My natural place is on stage,” he said.
Roth, the tenor of the group 
with 20 years of barbershop sing-
ing experience, described the 
feeling of singing with FOURTU-NATE as a “buzz.”
“With the really good quar-
tets, there is just an energy in the sound,” he said. “We buzz more than we don’t.”
Although they have only been 
a quartet for a short time, their re-
lationship spans further than their 
harmonies. They laugh and joke as if they have known each other for decades.
But the members of FOURTU-
NATE said they owe much of their success to their quartet coach, Don Clause, whom they consider a leg-end in the barbershop community. 
He’s written competition rules and 
coached winning quartets.
“He’s got that magic touch that 
inspires others to do better,” Shaw 
said.
Tyson Adams, the newest mem-
ber to the barbershop community, 
said the other men in the group are what make being in a quartet 
the most fun. Adams said he used 
to enjoy singing for his own enjoy-ment but joining FOURTUNATE has changed his perspective.
“I saw how much people en-
joyed it, and I realized it’s not all about me,” he said. “It’s about [the audience] and making them happy.”

NEWBERRY – The 16-field, state-of-the-art 
youth baseball tournament facility was de-
signed to boost tourism and bring out-of-town families to Newberry.
But the first scheduled season of tourna-
ments hasn’t gone as planned for some teams.
Nations Park, 25325 SW 15th Ave., original-
ly booked five weeks of youth baseball tourna-ments. But recently, the facility announced it would condense all of the scheduled tourna-ments into one week in July.
Bobby Holland, a general manager of Rip-
ken Baseball — a youth tournament organizer in South Carolina — said he received com-plaints from people who planned to attend the Newberry tournament. They came to him looking for other options.
The schedule change was announced via 
email, he said, without an explanation. He said most people plan for a travel-ball tourna-ment nearly a year in advance, and last-minute 
scheduling changes can cause teams to cancel.
“I feel bad for them – for the kids especial-
ly,” he said. “It’s something you look forward 
to all year.”
Wayne Gomes, owner of Virginia Baseball 
Academy, was one of them.
Gomes said he had planned to bring a team 
of 12 boys plus their families to Newberry for the week. But when he heard about the sched-ule change, he said they had to withdraw.
“We’ve set these plans for six months, and now they’re telling us its not going to happen,” he said. “Parents are upset about it. We’re dis-appointed. It was going to be our summer va-cation.”
Gomes said they decided to pull out of 
the Newberry tournament because canceling 
hotel reservations and flights and changing 
work schedules on short notice would not be feasible for the dozen families involved.
“They can’t just take off work,” he said, 
noting that many extended family members had planned to accompany the players.
In lieu of the Newberry tournament, 
Gomes said his team struggled to squeeze into another tournament and eventually found an 
opening in another state.
“We’re still stuck with some plane tickets 
that we can’t do anything about,” he said.
Jules Johnson, a baseball operations man-
ager at the park, said the schedule switch was 
designed to give management time to improve minor aspects of the park.
“We have some infrastructure things that 
we’re taking care of,” he said.
Johnson noted that most participants made 
the switch with no problems.
“We’re going to have one big shebang,” 
he said. “So far, the response has been great. We’re really fortunate.”
However, he said he didn’t know how ex-
actly many teams were rescheduled over the four-week period.
Mike Spina Jr., director of the Newberry-
based Elite Pro Ball Academy, emphasized that the work being done on the fields is mini-mal.
“They’ve got a couple things they’re work-
ing on before … they let kids play on the fields,” said Spina, a former Atlanta Braves first baseman who was instrumental in bring-ing Nations Park to Newberry. “It’s nothing 
serious – just some irrigation.”
He said the park’s goal is to optimize the 
facilities to not disappoint travelers.“They’re trying to make these premier 
fields,” he said. “They don’t want to let people 
down. They want the grass as green as pos-sible.”
Although park management was profes-
sional and polite in handling the situation, Gomes said, perhaps the scheduling incident shows the new park was unprepared for the 
beginning of the season.
“I just wasn’t willing to take that chance,” 
he said. “Maybe next year.”

In what was likely their last game in Gainesville, 
Florida’s seniors emphatically ensured it wasn’t 
their last game as Gators.
By doing so, they also earned a chance to get 
revenge.
Florida (18-2) thwarted a potent Denver (18-3) 
offense en route to a 16-5 win at Donald R. Dizney 
Stadium on Sunday as it advanced to the third 
round of the NCAA Tournament. Florida will play Syracuse for the fourth time in two years in a rematch of last year’s national semifinal.UF halts potent offenseLANDON WATNICK

A week after Florida granted his 
release to transfer, forward DeVon 
Walker had a change of heart. 
Walker will return to the Gators 
and has enrolled in summer classes in Gainesville, the school announced Monday. 
“Florida is such a great place, and 
the more I thought about it, I just real-ized this is where I want to be,” Walk-er said in a release. “The coaching staff has helped me get better on and off the court over the past year and I really enjoy being around my team-mates, so I’m excited to refocus on my future here in Gainesville.”
Coach Billy Donovan added in a 
release: “We always encourage guys to do what they feel is best for their 
future, and we’re glad that DeVon 
will be continuing with us here at 
Florida.”
Walker arrived at Florida in 2012 
as the No. 142 recruit and No. 31 small forward in his class, according to Ri-
vals.com. But the Winter Haven na-tive rarely saw playing time outside the final minutes of routs during his freshman season. 
The 6-foot-6, 191-pound Walker 
scored 20 points, grabbed 17 re-bounds, blocked four shots and aver-aged four minutes in 25 contests dur-ing his freshman season.Walker will compete with center 
Patric Young, senior forwards Will Yeguete and Casey Prather, transfers Dorian Finney-Smith and Damon-tre Harris and five-star recruit Chris Walker for playing time next season. 
His decision to return puts Florida 
at 12 scholarship players – one below the NCAA maximum. 
Ogbueze to Charlotte: Former 
Florida point guard Braxton Og-bueze – a Charlotte, N.C., native – an-nounced his decision on Monday to transfer to UNC Charlotte.
Ogbueze will sit out a year, per 
NCAA transfer rules. He will have three years of eligibility starting the 2014-15 season and will enroll in sum-mer classes at UNCC starting May 20. 
“Definitely being closer to home – 
that was a big deal for me,” Ogbueze said. “Not only that, but going to a program that believes in and supports me.”
“From Day 1, coach (Alan) Ma-
jor, (assistant) coach (Ryan) Odom, ... (assistant) coach (Desmond) Oliver, (assistant) coach (Orlando) Vandross – they’re familiar with my game and they know I can play. That’s just a great, great fit for me.”
Ogbueze also considered Murray 
State. He visited the UNC Charlotte campus with his mother last week.
Charlotte originally recruited Brax-
ton out of high school.“It’s closer to home. It’s conve-
nient for him,” said Klem Ogbueze, Braxton’s older brother. “Also, he’s 
playing for a program and a coach 
that really believes in him and wants to develop him as a player. Not only 
as a player, but as a person years after playing basketball. We felt like it was a good fit for him.
“The school isn’t too far from the 
house. Now we could see him play 
more often.”  
Klem attended UNC Charlotte 
from 2007-2011. Braxton’s older sister, Ana Ogbueze, also attended UNCC. 
Ogbueze was granted his release 
from Florida on May 1, a decision that 
also stemmed from a lack of playing 
time.

Florida first baseman Vickash Ramjit struggled 
in his last weekend at McKethan Stadium.
The senior came into Sunday’s rubber match 
against Auburn after going 1 for 7 at the plate in 
the first two games of the series. Ramjit’s batting woes continued for the first seven innings on Sun-day – the first sacker went hitless with two strike-outs in his first three at-bats.
But Ramjit had a chance to erase his bad memo-
ries in the bottom of the eighth. 
Florida scored its first run of the game on a 
Casey Turgeon double, and Taylor Gushue and Zack Powers worked walks to load the bases, bringing Ramjit to the plate. He didn’t stay there long.
The senior saw three pitches from Auburn 
right-hander Terrance Dedrick – all strikes. Ramjit walked back to the dugout before third baseman Josh Tobias hit into a fielder’s choice to end the rally and the Gators’ chances to win its final home game of the season.
“That’s baseball; it happens,” coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said. 
Florida (28-25, 13-14 
Southeastern Conference) went down in order in the ninth to end the game 
4-1, dropping the series to Auburn (31-20, 11-16, SEC).
The Gators’ troubles with runners in scoring 
position began early in the game.
Gushue and right fielder Justin Shafer knocked 
back-to-back singles with two outs in the first, but designated hitter Zack Powers grounded out to end the inning.

  After fanning Missouri’s Mackenzie 
Sykes for the ﬁ  nal out of the seventh, ju-
nior right-hander Hannah Rogers ran to Taylore Fuller and hugged the freshman catcher as their teammates dashed out of the bullpen and joined the celebration.
  Rogers had just sealed No. 1 seed Flor-
ida’s 10-4 victory against third-seeded Missouri and its ﬁ  rst Southeastern Con-ference Tournament title since 2009. 
  During Florida’s three wins against 
eighth-seeded Alabama, ﬁ  fth-seeded Georgia and Missouri, Rogers threw 288 pitches in 15 innings of work – including 186 in two contests Saturday. She tallied 14 strikeouts and allowed 14 hits and 11 runs in three matches. Ten of her 15 in-nings pitched were scoreless. 
  “She won’t give in,” coach Tim Walton 
said. “She’s not somebody who’s trying to get the ball over the plate that often. She’s trying to work the corners and change speeds. She’s really changed speeds. And I think the rise ball has really helped her too this year. Being able to get a few more strikeouts when people are looking down, down, down, she gets them to chase a lit-tle bit, too.” 
  Friday’s contests were canceled due 
to inclement weather, so Walton selected Rogers as Saturday’s starter against Geor-gia in the semiﬁ  nals after a day of rest. 
  Rogers’ pitching helped Florida’s of-
fense jump to early leads in its ﬁ  rst two contests. She held Alabama and Georgia to one combined hit during the ﬁ  rst four innings as Florida held leads of 4-0 and 9-0, respectively. 
  “I was just mixing it up and being con-
ﬁ  dent with every pitch,” Rogers said after Florida’s 9-5 win against Georgia. “I was trusting the calls and letting my defense work for me behind me.”
  When Rogers struggled on the mound, 
the Gators already held comfortable leads. In the ﬁ  fth against the Crimson Tide and Bulldogs, Rogers allowed a combined seven runs on seven hits. 
  After two hot starts on Thursday and 
early Saturday, Rogers came through in three innings of relief Saturday night against the Tigers. She earned her fourth save of the season, notching three strike-outs and giving up only three hits. 
  Rogers allowed a home run to Mis-
souri designated player Rachel Hay in the sixth inning, but recovered and retired ﬁ  ve of her ﬁ  nal six batters. 
  Walton has seen 
Rogers reﬁ  ne her game this season and saw the results during the con-ference tournament. 
  “She’s just getting 
tighter spins, a little bit more revolutions on 
her spin, getting a little tighter rotation,” Wal-ton said. “(She’s) not 
necessarily trying to throw it harder. Just getting the ball to break, getting the ball in and out of the strike zone.”  
  Gators learn NCAA Tournament 
seeding: Florida (52-7), the No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, will host Hamp-ton, USF and Georgia Southern this week-end at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium. UF will square off against Hampton ﬁ  rst on Friday at 6 p.m.
  USF (Big East), Hampton (Mid-Eastern 
Atlantic Conference) and Georgia South-ern (Southern Conference) also won their conference tournaments. 
  The Gators earned a top-ﬁ  ve national 
seed for the sixth straight season. Seven of the tournament’s 16 national seeds were awarded to SEC squads.

  Although the conditions were different on the 
final day of the Southeastern Conference Outdoor 
Championships, the results were the same as they were earlier this season. 
  Florida’s men and women finished second and 
fourth, respectively – mirroring their results from the conference indoor championships earlier this season. The men finished runner up to Arkansas and the women finished fourth behind winner Texas A&M. 
  “Credit to the Texas A&M women and Arkan-
sas men for what they did this weekend,” coach Mike Holloway said in a release. “I’m pleased with both of our teams’ efforts today. I felt like we 
recovered well from yesterday and we challenged 
them to be who we are and do what we do.”
  On Sunday – the final day of the meet – Florida 
dominated the field events, winning three of the four events it competed in. 
  Ciarra Brewer and Omar Craddock won con-
ference championships in the women’s and men’s long jump, respectively, while freshman Marija Vucenovic won the women’s javelin throw. 
  Brewer’s jump of 13.85m was a personal best, 
school record and meet record – all while defend-ing her Southeastern Conference title from last year. 
  “Coach (Nic Petersen) has been preparing us 
and making sure we don’t foul early,” Brewer said in a release. “He pushed me back (on my approach) to make sure I get a legal mark because your first jump is typically your best because you’re fresh off 
warm-ups. I just made sure I pushed out and I felt 
great down the runway. I was a little timid at first because I did the long jump yesterday and my legs were a little sore but I knew I was going to be okay. I hit the board and I just felt it. I landed and heard the crowd and I knew it was going to be big.”  “I didn’t even know I broke the school record 
until I heard it over the loudspeaker,” Brewer said. “I’ve jumped 45 feet in practice and I knew I could 
do it in competition. ”
  Added Holloway: “For Ciarra to break not 
only the school record, but the SEC meet record 
…I’m just so proud. You think about all the great jumpers who have come through this conference, and I just can’t say enough about what she did to-day.”
  Craddock also defended his Southeastern 
Conference crown in the men’s long jump with a 
season-best distance of 16.46m. Sophomore Mar-
quis Dendy finished behind Craddock.
  “Omar did what Omar does, he came out 
and competed at his best,” Holloway said.“I’m very proud of his and Marquis’ efforts today and I think it certainly builds momentum for the re-gional meet.
  Vucenovic and Fawn Miller earned the Gators 
a combined 18 points with a 1-2 finish in the wom-en’s javelin throw. Vucenovic threw a distance of 52.91m, while Miller threw a season-best distance of 51.30m. 
  “Coach (Steve) Lemke’s goal was for Marija 
and Fawn to go 1-2,” Holloway said. “He chal-lenged them to do that and they both performed well and competed hard today.”

UF Coachhitter Cody Dent on ﬁ  ve pitches to start the third inning, and 
center ﬁ  elder Richie Martin singled. But the middle of the order 
failed to produce, with Turgeon dropping down a sacriﬁ  ce bunt and Gushue and Shafer going down in order. The Gators did not get a runner past second again until the eighth inning.
  “We just didn’t hit well at all this weekend,” Martin said. 
“We just couldn’t get the bats going.”
  But while the offense struggled at the plate, Florida saw an 
improved performance from its starting pitcher, freshman Eric Hanhold.
  The ﬁ  rst-year right-hander had not pitched more than 4.1 in-
nings in a game all season, but gave the Gators ﬁ  ve innings of one-run ball on Sunday.
  “I felt pretty good,” Hanhold said. “I was just trying to get a 
good start for us so we could get some momentum.
  Hanhold surrendered a leadoff homer 
to Tigers third baseman Damek Tomscha to start the ﬁ  fth inning, but he recovered and picked up three ﬂ  y outs to end his start.
  “He’s throwing the ball down hill,” O’Sullivan said. “He’s 
got three pitches he throws for strikes; he’s got a really good arm … One run over ﬁ  ve innings, he did his job.”
  But when Hanhold turned the ball over to freshman Jay Car-
michael, the Gators got into trouble. 
  After getting the ﬁ  rst out of the sixth, Carmichael beaned Au-
burn designated hitter Patrick Savage. Carmichael recovered to get a strikeout and induced a ground ball to shortstop, but Dent could not handle the sharp grounder, allowing second baseman Jordan Ebert to reach base.
  O’Sullivan brought in left-hander Danny Young to match 
up against left-handed center ﬁ  elder Ryan Tella, but the move backﬁ  red.

  “I thought the defense played 
amazing today as they do every 
single game,” senior goalkeeper Meagher said. “We just always 
come out with a lot effort. …we 
played together as a unit.”
  Denver entered the tourna-
ment ranked seventh in the country in scoring with 14.37 
goals per game. Dever defeated 
Jacksonville 14-7 in Gainesville on Friday to advance to play Florida.
  “A total team effort,” coach 
Amanda O’Leary said of her team’s defensive performance. “I thought Mikey came up really big in the goal cage. I though Ja-
mie and Emily did a great job on 
the two-man on the crease.”
  The Gators held redshirt se-
nior Kara Secora, who led the Pioneers with 58 goals through 
Friday. to no goals and two as-
sists. Denver attacker Jill Reme-napp also led the country with 3.63 assists per game during the regular season. Florida held her 
to one assist on Sunday.
  Senior defender Sam Farrell 
took the task of defending at-
tacker Jenn Etzel, and the rest of 
the defense effectively double-
teamed the other attackers on scoring chances.  “I thought we communicated 
well,” O’Leary said. “We slid well on the doubles, so really pleased with our defensive effort 
today.”
  Florida jumped on top 3-0 in 
the first 3:05 as senior attacker 
Kitty Cullen scored unassisted by running left to right across 
the Denver defensive zone and 
shot across her body just inside the left post — the first of her five goals on the day.
  Sophomore midfielder Shan-
non Gilroy won the ensuing draw and scored as she took the ball straight through the Pio-neers’ defense, and Ashley Bruns 
scored less than 20 seconds lat-
er.
  The Pioneers would get on the 
board 30 seconds later as defend-er Kate Henrich controlled the 
draw and got the ball to Secora. 
Once inside of the Gators’ arc, Secora passed the ball to mid-fielder Annabelle Gilbride, who bounced it through Meagher’s 
legs to make it 3-1.
  Denver wouldn’t score for the 
remainder of the half and didn’t 
get on the board again until the 
28:22 mark of the second half on 
a free-position shot from Etzel.
  The one first-half goal was a season low for the Pioneers, and 
they didn’t score their second 
goal in the run-of-play until the 14:45 mark of the second half.
  O’Leary said her group of 
13 seniors gave an ideal perfor-
mance for their last one at home. 
  “This is a very special group,” O’Leary said. “They will go down in history. They will always have 
a very special place in my heart. For them to go out on this note, I think again is a testament to their 
work ethic, their team chemistry, 
to their willingness to put it all on the line every single day.”
  Florida played Syracuse in the 
NCAA semifinals last season, 
falling 14-13 in overtime after 
letting a 12-5 lead slip away.   The two teams met in Miami 
earlier this year with – the Gators prevailed, 14-10.
  “We can’t get back that game 
last year,” O’Leary said. “[Syra-
cuse’s Carrier Dome] is a little 
overwhelming … We’ve over-come some challenges this sea-son, so hopefully that’ll just be another one.”

 Last week, sports were the last thing on my 
mind.
  Nine days ago, I made the four-hour drive 
from Gainesville to my home in Lake Worth to say goodbye to my grandfather, Shelly Levy. He passed away a week ago today.
  Without my grandpa, I wouldn’t have such 
an incredible love for sports. I wouldn’t dedicate hours of my time every day to watching, reading about and thinking about sports. I wouldn’t be writing this column, and you wouldn’t be reading it.
  My grandpa regaled me with stories of his 
youth. He told me about how his mother – my great-grandmother – would give him a sandwich and a quarter, and he and his friends would catch 
a New York Giants doubleheader at the Polo 
Grounds. 
  He was a diehard Giants fan and was devastated 
when they moved to San Francisco, but he found a new love in the New York Mets a few years later. 
Although I grew up a Yankees fan, he never criti-
cized me too much.
  He loved sports until the very end. The last 
thing he gave me was a copy of Sports Illustrated 
that sat on his living-room end table. It’s sitting in 
my room right now.
  I want to dedicate this column to my grandpa, 
because I wouldn’t be writing it if not for him. However, I know my grandpa wouldn’t want 
me to mope, and instead would want to see me 
be happy and celebrate his life and the sports he loved so much. 
  And there’s going to be plenty of celebrating of 
sports in this paper this coming semester. Several UF teams are going to be experiencing – excuse the cliché – the joy of victory or the agony of defeat. 
  The women’s tennis team and lacrosse team are both two rounds into the NCAA Tournament – Michelle Provenzano and 
Chuck Kingsbury will 
have you covered on those fronts.
  Men’s and women’s golf 
are competing in the NCAA regionals and the NCAA 
championships, respectively. Track and field just finished competing at the Southeastern Confer-ence Outdoor Championships. Richard Johnson 
and Gordon Streisand will provide you with up-
to-date information on those squads.
  The Gators softball team just swept through the 
Southeastern Conference Tournament – the first 
time the team has won the regular season and tour-
nament titles since 2009. Landon Watnick is your go-to for all the action at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium this summer.
  And Josh Jurnovoy and I will both be covering 
the baseball team as it limps towards a possible NCAA Tournament bid.
  So while summer is a much more relaxed time 
around Gainesville, the alligatorSports staff won’t 
be taking a break. In addition to the normal sports 
coverage, there will be plenty of additional com-mentary, including regular columns from myself (I promise they won’t all be this depressing) and Josh. We’ll also feature the return of the annual Al-
ligator Awards for the best and worst in Florida 
sports this past year.
  It’s going to be a good summer. So watch the 
thermometer rise, pop open a refreshing beverage 
and check out some sports. That’s what my grand-
pa would do.

Lauren Embree grabbed a bittersweet 
victory on Sunday.
The senior shut out Georgia Tech’s Eliza-
beth Kilborn 6-0 in two sets to put Florida 
ahead 2-0 in her final home match as a Gator – a 4-0 win against No. 23 Georgia Tech (15-10) to send No. 1 Florida (24-2) to the Round 
of 16 in the NCAA Tournament.
“The last game, I was thinking about 
that I was going to finish, that my chances 
were pretty high of finishing, and then af-ter the last point when I was done I was just 
thinking ‘I’m never going to get to play here 
again,’” Embree said.
Embree worked Kilborn at her corners 
and at backcourt to trip the Yellow Jacket 
up in the final game. Embree served to back-
court and Kilborn couldn’t contest it, send-ing the ball straight into the net.
As Embree grabbed her 116th career sin-
gles win to a standing ovation, senior Caro-
line Hitimana struggled to finish her match.
Hitimana came out strong in the first set, 
defeating Jasmine Minor 6-1. But the second 
set came along and Minor wised up, battling 
Hitimana back and forth on the scoreboard 
at a 3-3 tie at the clincher. 
“I was kind of sad because I knew I didn’t 
have anymore matches to play at home, but we still have matches to come, so I’m focus-ing on that,” Hitimana said.
Coach Roland Thornqvist also shared the 
bittersweet feeling of Sunday’s match.
“ B o t h 
Caroline and Lau-
ren have 
had nothing but great attitudes and wins 
here,” Thornqvist said. “It’s a privilege to have them on the team. It makes my job not 
feel like a job.”
Despite the pressure of playing its final 
home match of the season, Florida played 
a tough style that Georgia Tech couldn’t shake. 
After Embree finished the first singles 
match of the day, freshman Brianna Morgan followed the senior’s victory with one of her own.
In the final game, Morgan hit the ball 
out to bring the match to deuce. The fresh-man managed to trip up Megan Kurey with a spike at midcourt. Playing for the match point, Morgan served up a ball to backcourt that Kurey couldn’t follow through on. The 
Yellow Jacket smacked the ball into the net, 
giving Morgan the 6-2 win and increasing Florida’s lead to 3-0.
“Brianna has been exceptional all year 
long,” Thornqvist said. 
“I think she’s still getting used to the 
doubles game; there’s clearly a little bit of lag in the development there right now, but her singles game is just phenomenal. She’s 
fast. She’s got a great racquet speed. She 
makes good decisions now, so she’s very difficult to beat.”
Junior Olivia Janowicz needed to come 
from behind to clinch Florida’s 4-0 victory.
After winning 6-2 in the first set, Janow-
icz fell apart at the beginning of the second. She was at a three-point deficit to Muriel Wacker, but rallied through two-breaks to 
forge ahead at 4-3. Janowicz kept a consis-
tent rhythm, hitting at the sides and won out for two more games to grab a 6-3 victory. 
The Gators won the first point of the 
match in doubles, with Alex Cercone and Hitimana winning at 8-2, followed by Em-bree and Sofie Oyen for the clincher. 
Embree and Oyen’s doubles match kept 
fans at edge, as the Gators rallied ahead 
against Kurey and Kendal Woodard, then dropped games shortening their lead to 6-5. 
“We knew that Kendal had a really big 
serve so we thought that you know, ‘hang in 
there in the service games with her and may-be we can get lucky enough to play a good game,’” Embree said. “She missed a couple 
first serves but we just knew we had to hold 
our serves or else we’d be in trouble.”
Embree and Oyen won a game, then 
Kurey and Woodard won one right back. The Gators finally edged the Yellow Jackets 
out in the final game, as Woodard sent the 
ball into the net and gave the Florida pairing an 8-6 win.
UF advances to the Round of 16 in Cham-
paign, Ill., and will play Duke on Friday.
Thornqvist said he’s confident in his 
team perform well away from home.
“I feel like we’ve done everything we 
should have,” Thornqvist said. 
“That’s what we always sort of preach; 
once you get here, you want to feel like you’ve covered everything and then you can live with whatever results happen the rest of the summer. No matter what hap-pens now, I’ll be the first guy to shake these players’ hands because they work really hard with great attitudes and we’re rolling up there with seven players ready to go and that’s a great feeling.”
