THE CHINESE AMERICAN 
COMMUNITY HOSTED A 
VIGIL AT TURLINGTON PLAZA
By Jiselle Lee and Alan 
Halaly
Alligator Staff Writers
A crowd of more than 100 
people bowed their heads as 
Pinpin Sheng’s prayer echoed 
through a megaphone at Turl -
ington Plaza Saturday, followed 
by a moment of silence held na -
tionwide to honor the victims of 
the Atlanta spa shootings earlier 
this week. 
“We mourn with the people 
who lost their families,” the 
40-year-old Gainesville resident 
said in between eight chimes 
from Century Tower. “Lord, 
please give us love to love each 
other. We’re all one family.”
Following the lead of United 
Chinese Americans, a nonprofit 
Chinese cultural and heritage 
organization that planned vigils 
across the nation Saturday, the 
Gainesville Chinese American 
community participated in four 
simultaneous rallies at street 
intersections and a subsequent 
vigil at Turlington Plaza.
Saturday’s demonstrations 
came after eight people, six of 
Asian American descent, were 
killed during three mass shoot -
ings at spas and massage parlors 
in Atlanta on Tuesday.
The shooter may have 
planned additional shootings 
in Florida, according to Atlanta 
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
More than 3,795 accounts of 
unprovoked acts of anti-Asian 
violence occurred from March 
19, 2020 to Feb. 28, 2021, ac -
cording to Stop Asian American 
and Pacific Islander Hate, a na -
tional organization document -
ing self-reported crimes against 
Asian Americans. There have 
been 987 incidents from January 
to February.
For Asian American fami -
lies across the country, there 
is fear of violence and racism 
that comes with being associ -
ated with the “Chinese Virus.” 
Former President Donald Trump 
used this term to reference CO -
VID-19, revealing how regard -
less of ethnicity, hatred toward 
Asian Americans has become an everyday ordeal.
Rong Zhang, a 40-year-old 
UF computer science professor, 
was one of the main organizers 
for the gatherings Saturday. She 
said she is relieved the shooter 
was stopped before he had the 
chance to come to Florida.
Zhang said Gainesville’s Chi -
nese community began organiz -
ing the vigil through the group 
messaging app WeChat as soon 
as it heard about the shootings.
By spreading awareness 
within the Gainesville commu -
nity, Zhang said she hopes she 
can stand in solidarity with oth -
ers who are in mourning and 
now fear for their lives.
At 6 p.m., protesters came 
together at four busy intersec -
tions: West University Avenue 
and Southwest 13th Street, 
Southwest 34th Street and Ar -
cher Road, Archer Road and 
Tower Road, and Northwest 
34th Street and Northwest 23rd 
Street. Many were met with 
honking horns and Gainesville 
residents who rolled down their 
car windows to cheer in solidar -
ity.
Shigang Chen, a 50-year-old 
UF computer science professor, 
stood at the corner of Southwest 
34th Avenue and Archer Road 
and held a sign that read “Proud 
Asian Americans.” Chen said he 
wanted to speak out against ris -
ing anti-Asian racism during the 
COVID-19 pandemic to make it 
clear that Gainesville and the 
UF community doesn’t tolerate 
such behavior.
As someone who has lived in 
the city since 2002, he said his 
experience as a Chinese Ameri -
can has been relatively neutral. 
Chen said he was surprised to 
see so much support from pass -
ersby.
“This is a great nation. We’re 
here to make it better,” Chen 
said. “It’s not perfect, but we’re 
here to begin.”
Ching Zhou was appalled 
by the attacks in Atlanta. The 
57-year-old Chinese American 
Gainesville resident said the 
protest was thrown together last 
minute Saturday afternoon, but 
the large turnout showed how 
passionate the community feels ‘Invisible for too long’: Gainesville mourns Atlanta shooting victims

Gainesville City Commissioner 
Gail Johnson eagerly hugged Com -
missioner-elect Desmon Duncan-
Walker at an election watch party 
Tuesday evening to celebrate their 
victories, signaling a new era of col -
laboration between the two com -
missioners.
Johnson was re-elected to the 
At-Large Seat B on the commission, 
and Duncan-Walker beat incumbent 
City Commissioner Gigi Simmons to represent District 1, which encom -
passes most of downtown and East 
Gainesville. 
In the coming months, Duncan-
Walker will brainstorm ways to 
make sure she is a mouthpiece for 
the people in her district. She plans 
to place their concerns at the fore -
front of her policy-making and is 
considering holding community 
engagement events like pancake 
breakfasts and quarterly district 
meetings to accomplish this goal.  
“I want to make sure that District 
1 sees me often and that they are 
able to engage with me in meaning -ful ways,” Duncan-Walker said. “I 
am their voice. And the only way 
that you can be a voice for the peo -
ple is to listen to them.”
Duncan-Walker won against 
Simmons, who was elected in 2018, 
to represent District 1 in a close race. 
According to official results, Dun -
can-Walker earned 52.49% of the 
vote and Simmons earned 48.51%.

THE DECISION FOLLOWS 
LOW POSITIVITY RATES
By Manny Rea
Alligator Staff Writer 
After a monthlong streak of the 
lowest number of on-campus COV -
ID-19 cases this semester, UF relaxed 
its mandatory biweekly testing for 
students.
In an email sent to students March 
12, UF Vice President for Student 
Affairs D’Andra Mull announced 
students in Greek life or living in a 
residence hall and not taking face-to-
face classes would no longer need to 
be tested every two weeks starting 
March 15. As a result, available test -
ing hours will be reduced at on-cam -
pus locations. 
Epidemiologists from the UF 
Health Screen, Test & Protect pro -
gram recommended the pull back 
following the university’s lowest 
reported cases since the start of the 
semester, Mull wrote. UF Health has 
advised the university since the start 
of the pandemic, basing decisions on 
testing and contact tracing data, Ken 
Garcia, a UF Health spokesperson 
wrote in an email. 
UF’s announcement also men -
tioned reduced availability in appoint -
ment scheduling for tests at places in -
cluding Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and 
the UF Cultural Plaza parking garage 
starting Monday. 
Garcia said he’s not anticipating 
any future changes to who is exempt 
from guidelines.
“Students in face-to-face classes will continue to be part of routine 
testing on campus,” he wrote. “There 
is a natural overlap of these students 
who also live in residence halls and 
the Greek community, so there will 
still be monitoring in these areas for 
spread.”
The weekly seven-day average 
for positive cases tested on campus 
remained below 1% from Feb. 25 to 
March 11 before returning back to 
1%, according to the university’s test -
ing dashboard. The number of people 
in quarantine also dropped to a low of 
221 on March 7, although the number 
has increased to 418 as of Sunday. 
As a student who hasn’t stepped 
into a classroom this school year, 
Yami Gonzalez, a 20-year-old UF 
business administration third year, 
felt the original precautions were the 
best way to monitor the spread as stu -
dents returned to campus.
Gonzalez lives in Beaty Towers 
where groups of four residents share 
a kitchen and bathroom. She said CO -
VID-19 cases haven’t been an issue 
on her floor, but it may differ in other 
dorms where larger pools of students 
interact in communal bathrooms and 
facilities. 
Wider student testing require -
ments aided the university’s efforts to 
mitigate spread, she said.
“I thought it was uncalled for,” 
Gonzalez said about the decrease in 
mandated students under new guide -
lines.
Juan Varela, a 21-year-old UF 
applied physiology and kinesiology 
junior, also acknowledged the bal -
ancing act the university does with student independence and disease 
control. He has one HyFlex lecture 
course he has elected to watch from 
Zoom but is still required to test for 
COVID-19 under the updated guide -
lines. 
He lives in Tolbert Hall, which has 
experienced sporadic positive cases in 
the last two semesters. When a floor -
mate tests positive, everyone else is 
urged to get tested immediately which 
he said has made living on campus a 
hassle. Varela gets tested weekly at 
the stadium gate 7 to get ahead of the 
mandated biweekly scheduling. 
He received the Johnson & John -
son vaccine last week at a Jackson -
ville site for his clinical volunteering 
but plans to continue his afternoon 
testing appointments. 
“This is probably the next step to -
wards going to some state of normal -
cy,” Varela said. “So I’m glad they’re 
doing it.”

HADDISH AND BROWN 
WILL SPEAK ON MARCH 24
By Carolina Ilvento and J.P . 
Oprison
Alligator Staff Writer 
Actress Tiffany Haddish and Tik -
Tok star Tabitha Brown will speak 
virtually at free UF events March 24. 
On the university’s second Gator 
Recharge Day in a breakless Spring 
semester, students will have the op -
portunity to attend two Zoom webi -
nars with Brown and Haddish, start -
ing at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m., respectively.
Haddish will speak in a Zoom we -
binar consisting of a 45-minute mod -
erated conversation followed by a 
15-minute Q&A session. The webinar 
will allow for 3,000 attendees, Accent 
Chair Steven Wolf wrote in an email. 
He has not answered The Alligator’s 
emails asking about the logistics and 
set up of Brown’s interview event.
Accent will also host a watch par -
ty at 5 p.m. of Haddish’s 2020 movie 
‘Like a Boss.’ Students can watch the 
movie virtually or in person at the Phillips Center for the Performing 
Arts.
Anyone with a valid UFL email 
address can sign up for the inter -
view events until March 24 at noon. 
The movie will be available through 
Zoom and screened in-person to the 
students at the watch party. Students 
must bring their Gator 1 ID, wear a 
mask and be cleared for campus.
There will be 375 tickets avail -
able for the Haddish movie watch 
party, and students will sit socially 
distanced in pairs, he said. Students 
will also be required to scan a QR 
code once seated for contact tracing 
purposes. 
Wolf declined to comment on 
how much money Accent is paying 
Haddish and Brown and whether the 
programming board is paying as well. 
Both organizations are funded by 
student fees. The Alligator requested 
both speakers’ contracts.
Haddish is known for her roles 
in the movies “Keanu,” “Girls Trip,” 
and the TBS sitcom “The Last O.G.” 
She won an Emmy in 2018 for her 
performance on “Saturday Night 
Live” and a Grammy this month for 
her comedy album “Black Mitzvah.”Brown has worked with Haddish 
starring in the film “All Between Us.” 
She is also known for her roles in 
NBC’s comedy show “Will & Grace” 
and the Freeform drama “Switched at 
Birth.”
Brown is a North Carolina-
born actress, mother and wife. She 
amassed two million TikTok follow -
ers in 40 days for her videos featuring 
vegan recipes, cooking tips and nug -
gets of wisdom, and is affectionately 
known as “America’s mom,” accord -
ing to a Facebook event page. 
As of Sunday, over 200 peo -
ple have shown interest in Had -
dish’s event and over 130 people in 
Brown’s, according to the Facebook 
events’ pages. 
These are Accent’s second and 
third shows this Spring. The orga -
nization paid $120,000 for the first 
show of the semester, which featured 
YouTubers David Dobrik, Cody Ko 
and Noel Miller.

IN-PERSON, ONLINE COURSES 
TO REFLECT 
“NEARLY TYPICAL” YEAR 
By Manny Rea 
Alligator Staff Writer
UF will return to a nearly normal Sum -
mer B and Fall 2021 course offering, but 
mandatory COVID-19 testing and masking 
are still up in the air.
More than 70% of course credits will be 
in person in the Fall, which is similar to pre-
pandemic offerings, UF Provost and Senior 
Vice President Joe Glover said at the March 
18 UF Board of Trustees meeting. The uni -
versity based its plan on recommendations 
from UF Health epidemiologists, Glover 
wrote in a campus-wide email March 19. Dr. Michael Lauzardo, the head of UF 
Health’s Screen, Test & Protect program, 
also said at the meeting that if masking and 
vaccine efforts lessen cases in the coming 
months, his program will recommend full 
capacity classrooms, no physical distancing 
and fewer masks for Fall. 
In the email, Glover also stated there 
is zero evidence of transmission in class -
rooms and on-campus labs as 43% of un -
dergraduate students take in-person classes 
in the Spring. 
UF has yet to confirm whether the health 
guidelines that defined this past year’s cam -
pus experiences will continue in the Fall. 
“Masking and testing may still be in 
place and will be determined based on peo -
ple getting vaccinated and what the data 
are showing for COVID-19 cases,” Ken Gar -cia, a UF Health spokesperson wrote in an 
email. “We will also follow state and fed -
eral guidelines.”
UF isn’t the first major Florida univer -
sity to announce its Fall semester format. 
The University of Central Florida outlined a 
full face-to-face Fall return with mandatory 
masking and hand-washing on March 1. 
The University of South Florida released its 
plans March 3 to bring back pre-COVID-19 
delivery of Summer B and Fall.
Florida State University is preparing for 
face-to-face delivery of in-person classes in 
the Fall alongside face masks, social dis -
tancing and limited in-person meetings, 
Amy Farnum-Patronis, a university spokes -
person, wrote in an email. 
These announcements come as politi -
cal pressures and lost revenue push public universities to make reopening progress, 
Edwin Michael, a USF College of Public 
Health professor and epidemiologist, wrote 
in an email. It also coincides with more stu -
dents vying for in-person spots, he added.
Repealing social distancing require -
ments and new COVID-19 strands emerg -
ing, even as vaccines roll out, could lead 
to a resurgence in cases, Michael said. This 
could all affect Fall semesters across the 
state.
“They have either taken an optimistic 
view that it will be safe to go fully in-person 
or are hedging that somehow things can be 
controlled under the pressures to reopen,” 
he wrote.

mrea@alligator.orgUF Summer B and Fall 2021 semesters will have more in-person classesTHE DECISION CAME 
AFTER WEEKS OF 
STUDENT PROTESTS 
By Abigail Hasebroock
Alligator Staff Writer
The McCarty Woods 
conservation area isn’t very 
big nor is it very green. But 
after weeks of fighting for 
its survival, UF students and 
faculty emerged victorious. 
UF announced Tuesday it 
will not move forward with 
a plan to use the McCarty 
Woods conservation area as a 
construction site. 
While UF has not released 
any alternative plans yet, the 
university will continue to study 
“the various uses for McCarty 
Woods that would most benefit 
the university community,” UF 
spokesperson Hessy Fernandez 
wrote in an emailed statement. 
The area could still be used in 
future development plans.
Fernandez did not answer 
The Alligator’s questions 
regarding why UF made this 
decision, which campus leaders 
made the decision nor what 
“further study” of McCarty 
Woods entails. She wrote that 
the university currently has 
nothing to add to its statement.
The change to the Campus 
Master Plan, a 10-year plan for 
new facilities and buildings on 
campus, comes after opposition 
to the plan’s approval in 
December bred the Save 
McCarty Woods movement. 
In January, leaders of the 
movement created a Facebook, 
an Instagram and a petition that 
reached over 14,600 signatures.
“Every single person who 
signed that petition and came 
to protests and just shared 
our posts, all of that made a 
difference,” Sierra Scauzillo, 
the lead organizer of the 
movement, said. “Everyone deserves credit for this.”  
The group held three 
protests, two of which were 
in February and March. Each 
garnered about 10 attendees 
who endured cold and rainy 
conditions. On March 13, the 
group held a march with about 
40 supporters who walked from 
Lake Alice to Tigert Hall. 
Vasilios Kosmakos, a 
participant in the Save McCarty 
Woods movement, said he is 
ecstatic about UF’s decision. 
The victory proves that even 
a small group of passionate 
people can spur a change, he 
said. 
“We won, we saved McCarty 
Woods, that’s one step,” the 
21-year-old UF sustainability 
and international studies junior 
said. “There is a lot more down 
the line that needs to be done, 
but I’m really happy that we’ve 
gotten this far.”
Scauzillo, a 22-year-
old UF wildlife ecology and 
conservation senior, thanked 
all the members for their efforts 
shortly after UF’s decision was 
released.
“We will continue to stand 
for the preservation of ALL 
conservation lands, ensuring 
that McCarty does not face this 
challenge again in 2030 — that 
no ‘conservation lands’ do,” 
she wrote in a Slack message. 
Scauzillo is happy about the 
development but still believes 
many questions are left 
unanswered, she said. 
“It’s one battle in the midst 
of a war,” she said. “The 
decision that they’ve come 
to doesn’t address some of 
the root problems of how 
conservation areas can even be 
considered for development.”

MONDAY, MARCH 22, 2021   ALLIGATOR   5 
City Commission meetings. Hillel, 
also known as Gabe Kaimowitz, 
received about 12% of the vote, up 
from the 5% he earned when he ran 
in last year’s race.
City commissioners are elected 
to three-and-a-half-year terms, but 
terms will be extended to four years 
starting in 2022, Alachua County 
Supervisor of Elections spokesper -
son TJ Pyche said. Duncan-Walker 
will be up for reelection again in Fall 
2024. Johnson, who reaches a term 
limit in 2024, will not be able to run 
again.
Johnson and Duncan-Walker, 
whose swearing-in ceremonies have 
not yet been planned, have continu -
ally fought against the construction 
of luxury student housing in the 
city’s historically Black neighbor -
hoods. To accomplish this goal be -
fore even deciding to run for the 
commission seat, Duncan-Walker founded the Gainesville Alliance for 
Equitable Development (GAED).  
In her previous term, Johnson 
proposed a moratorium on East 
Gainesville development, which 
was an effort created in response 
to the controversial plan to build 
student apartments in the Pleasant 
Street neighborhood. Duncan-Walk -
er said she would have supported 
the moratorium, even though Com -
missioner Simmons voted against 
the effort. 
The pair have supported each 
other throughout their consecutive 
campaign trails. 
In a Tuesday night Facebook 
post, Johnson congratulated Dun -
can-Waker on her win.
“Our neighborhoods now have a 
fighting chance,” Johnson wrote in 
a Facebook post.
She said she is not only looking 
forward to working with Duncan-
Walker, but also collaborating with 
the county commission and school board in her second term.
Thrilled about her own win, 
Duncan-Walker said winning by 
only 118 ballots is a testament to 
her campaign’s grassroots approach 
to engaging East Gainesville voters.
“The people want to see you, 
they want to feel you, they want to 
touch you, they want to hear you,” 
Duncan-Walker said. “Pulling the 
folks in is what really helped them 
to understand who I am. It may 
have boosted their confidence in 
me.”
Simmons’ loss continues a nine-
year streak of one-term District 1 
commissioners. Scherwin Henry 
was the last to serve two terms from 
2006 to 2012.
Simmons said she wouldn’t rule 
out another run at city commission 
and plans to continue working in 
the community. 
“But right now, I want to spend 
some quality time with family,” 
Simmons said.
Danielle Chanzes, a 28-year-
old East Gainesville resident, spent 
Tuesday night setting up balloon 
arrangements at Duncan-Walker’s watch party and anxiously refresh -
ing the results page on her phone. 
The two met before she decided to 
run, and both later planned a well-
attended #StandForSeminaryLane 
protest to speak out against a con -
troversial Pleasant Street develop -
ment proposal. 
Chanzes said Johnson has 
fiercely defended Gainesville’s his -
torically Black communities during 
her term and knows that Desmon-
Walker has the integrity and vision 
to do the same.
“I think when it comes to making 
decisions about anything, we need 
to consider the most vulnerable,” 
Chanzes said. “I’m very, very con -
fident with Desmon, being on the 
commission now and joining Gail, 
that the most vulnerable of our citi -
zens will not be forgotten.”
Notably, voter turnout was at its 
lowest since 1997 in a Gainesville 
municipal election, with less than 
11% of registered voters casting 
their ballots.
In 2016, the District 4 and may -
oral election turnout was 44.36%. 
In 2019, just 12.96% of eligible vot -ers participated in the city’s mayoral 
race.
In 2020’s Regular Election when 
three city commissioners were elect -
ed, 184,103 Gainesville residents 
were eligible to vote. This year, the 
city had 90,794 eligible voters. 
Voter turnout is typically higher 
in primary and general elections 
than in city elections, Pyche said. 
“Traditionally, the turnout for 
these (local) elections is pretty low, 
so it’s not too far off — given the 
total number of voters — from what 
it normally is,” Pyche said. 
This was the last city election 
to be held on its own. In 2018, 
Gainesville made the decision to 
start holding city and county com -
mission elections together in Fall 
2022. 
Combining the elections should 
increase turnout in future city office 
races, Pyche said.

about combating anti-Asian racism.
“If I have a bad day, I guess that’s now 
an excuse,” Zhou said, in reference to an 
Atlanta police officer’s rationale for the 
shootings. “It’s just not right.”
Danling Fu, a 60-year-old UF education 
professor, said Asian American issues have 
been largely ignored nationally for many 
years.
“No matter how many years you con -
tribute to this nation, you will always be 
considered as a foreigner,” Fu said. “We 
immediately become the scapegoats. Scapegoats for war. Scapegoats for the fi -
nancial crisis. And now, we are the scape -
goats for the pandemic.”
Asian Americans are tired of being treat -
ed as if their voices don’t matter, she said.
“We’ve been invisible for too long,” she 
said. “Most of us are first generation immi -
grants. We come here for better education. 
For freedom, for democracy. We cannot 
stand for the racism against us.”
At the intersection of Southwest Archer 
Road and Southwest 34th Street, Han Yi, a 
40-year-old city resident, said she is proud 
to be an Asian American woman who has 
worked hard to live in this country.
“We come here to pursue our dreams,” 
Yi said. “Not to become victims.”
By about 7:30 p.m., those who rallied 
on the street corners were accompanied by students, faculty and community members 
at Turlington Plaza to host a candlelight 
vigil.
At the center of the crowd stood Jian -
geng Xue, a 45-year-old UF engineering 
professor. Xue said he appreciated Presi -
dent Fuchs’ statement that condemned 
anti-Asian violence; however, because the 
Atlanta shootings were not an isolated in -
cident, he said he would like to see more 
done in Gainesville and at UF to address 
the issue on all fronts. 
“It’s a very good first step,” Xue said. 
“But we need more action from the govern -
ment and from our society to really elimi -
nate discrimination.”
Pengfei Zhao, a 36-year-old UF assistant 
professor of education, was frustrated to 
see the media focus on the possibility that the victims could have been sex workers 
instead of the tragedy of their deaths.
There is a negative stigma attached to 
being a working-class Asian woman in the 
United States, Zhao said.
Zhao brought her 6-year-old daughter, 
Iris Yunzhi Wang, to the vigil to educate 
her about injustice against Asian Ameri -
cans.
“My girl has to grow up in this society,” 
Zhao said. “She needs to be able to speak 
up about injustices, chase her dreams and 
not be judged while doing that.”

THE SERIES WILL HOST LOCAL 
VENDORS AND MUSICIANS 
FOR THREE WEEKENDS IN 
MARCH, APRIL AND MAY
By Heather Bushman
Avenue Staff Writer
Over the next three months, 
the city of Alachua will be an 
open market for live music, local 
vendors and family fun.
The March, April & May (MAM) 
Concert Series kicked off March 
19 at Legacy Park in Alachua, 
marking the first of three weekend 
events supporting local businesses 
and musicians. Partnering with 
VipperEvents, the city of Alachua 
sponsored the series to reintroduce 
small businesses to the community 
and provide families with a safe 
and fun weekend outing.
 The MAM series will consist 
of three weekendlong events in 
March, April and May — March 19-
21, April 23-25 and May 21-23. The 
weekend events will run Friday 
from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday 
from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
The series will feature live 
music, local vendors and other 
entertainment activities. Fridays 
have been designated as movie 
nights, and Sundays will begin 
with a women’s empowerment 4K 
walk. Entry is free, but attendees 
can become a “MAMer” with the 
purchase of special packages that 
include T-shirts, food and drink 
tickets and other sponsored items 
from vendors.  
Each weekend will have a 
distinct musical theme. This 
weekend was the jazz, Latin and 
acoustic installment, April’s event 
will be southern rock and country-
focused, and the series will close in 
May with southern blues and funk 
performances.
The idea for the MAM 
series originated as a way to 
utilize Legacy Park, a 180-acre 
recreational site that opened 
in Alachua in 2017. The city of 
Alachua contacted VipperEvents, 
a local event-planning business, in 
October 2020 to begin putting the 
series together.
Jonathan Banks, head of VipperEvents, said his company 
has been involved with the city for 
years, spanning all the way back to 
when it was nothing more than a 
group of volunteers looking to lend 
a hand on city-sponsored projects.
“We actually structured 
this company to service the 
community,” Banks said. “Now 
that we have gotten this in line 
with the goals of Alachua, we 
formulated a company to reflect 
that.”
The next step in structuring 
the series was recruiting artists 
and vendors to participate. Banks 
said local and regional musicians 
submitted video auditions for a 
chance to perform, and the series 
enlisted a lineup of surprise 
“A-listers” to make appearances.
R.L. Bryant, director of the 
MAM series, said the businesses 
and artists were curated to provide 
talented musicians and vendors 
from the area with an opportunity to 
showcase their skills and products. 
This weekend’s lineup included 
artists La Lucha, Neptune’s Child, 
Gypsy Tears and more.
The event primarily serves as a reintroduction of local businesses 
to the community, Bryant said. 
Following the shutdowns caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, Bryant 
said the city of Alachua aimed to 
integrate consumers back into the 
business fabric.
“The city wanted to throw an 
event that brought the world back 
to commerce,” he said. 
Live music and other 
entertainment aspects were added 
to further incentivize community 
participation, Bryant said. 
“We look at it as the common 
denominators that bring people 
together,” Bryant said.
In revitalizing commerce, the 
MAM series also sought to boost 
community morale. Banks said 
with the combination of local 
business visibility, lodging for 
out-of-towners and the presence 
of more people in Alachua for the 
event, the entire city will benefit.
Bryant said the series will 
function as a reprieve for people 
who have been isolated since the 
onset of the pandemic. Masks will 
be encouraged, and Legacy Park’s 
180-acre space encourages social 
distancing.
These provisions, Bryant said, 
will enable Alachua families to be safe and social — an opportunity 
Bryant said the city needs now 
more than ever.
“Overall, we want a fun 
environment where families can 
come out, enjoy themselves and go 
home and say, ‘Hey, it was great to 
get back to people,’” Bryant said.

THE ART EXHIBITION AIMS TO 
PROVOKE THOUGHT ABOUT 
THE ‘GLACIAL WASTE’ SOCIETY 
PRODUCES ON A DAILY BASIS
By Valeriya Antonshchuk
Avenue Staff Writer
Ani Collier brought her artistic vision 
from the Black Sea to the Black C Art Gallery 
five years ago. Now, Collier’s latest exhibi -
tion takes Gainesville visitors to the glaciers of Antarctica. 
Inspired by a trip to the icy continent three 
years ago, the Bulgarian artist said she creat -
ed the new exhibit  “Glacial Waste” to show 
the beauty of Antarctica and bring attention 
to environmental issues in a unifying way.
“It just felt like the last continent that’s 
been kind of untouched by human pres -
ence,” she said.   
In “Glacial Waste,” Collier showcases her 
original photography from the trip, driven by 
her “adventurous spirit,” and fills the gallery 
floor with plastic water bottles. 
“I contrast the beauty of what we have 
with, you know, the plastic bottles — all the 
plastic that we keep producing day-in and 
day-out — and not just plastic, all the trash 
that we go through,” she said.
The exhibition opened March 12, but the 
gallery is continuing to collect plastic water 
bottles for the installation. They ask the pub -
lic to donate empty plastic water bottles to 
the gallery at 201 SE Second Place, Suite 111. 
Gallery director Iryna Kanishcheva said do -
nated bottles are sanitized and cleaned then 
added to the installation. Once the exhibi -
tion is completed, she said the bottles will be 
brought to a recycling facility. 
Collier plans to add an element of live per -
formance to the exhibition in April. She said 
she’s exploring several options of how to in -
corporate the performances. 
“It’s very interesting right now because 
we have the exhibit, we have an idea, but with the performances and what we’re do -
ing next, it’s going to happen organically in 
the next month,” Collier said. “So it’s sort of 
like an exciting and scary place at the same 
time.”
In whichever form the exhibition comes 
together, she said she wants to allow visi -
tors to independently experience and think 
through the piece. 
“I am not gonna lecture, I’m not gonna 
say anything. It’s just going to be — see what 
we have and see what we do, you know, and 
what can we do about it.” 
She said she believes art provides a uni -
fying and impactful way to spark thought 
about issues in society. While environmental 
issues like climate change may sometimes be 
divisive, Collier said she thinks art can pro -
vide a different perspective. 
“Art touches us in a way that somehow 
you remember,” Collier said. 
Kanishcheva, a Ukraine-native who is also 
the founder and director of GNV Urban Art 
LLC, echoed Collier’s intentions for the exhi -
bition and upcoming performances. 
“We are going to incorporate a meaningful 
message at the play to make people think,” 
she said. “We are not going to just say that 
— hey, don’t waste plastic, you know? Don’t 
put it here. Try to recycle, don’t you? We’re 
going to let them experience what’s going on 
without saying actually the words. That’s the 
plan.”
She said the exhibition’s main message is “to look at where we are now.” 
She spoke of the way humans approach 
recycling and sustainability efforts, and the 
“I’m just one person” mindset which may 
prompt individuals to be less concerned 
about their impact. The goal of the exhibi -
tion, she said, is to simply “start a dialogue” 
about these issues through visual and per -
forming arts. 
Black C Art Gallery is also cycling through 
rotational shows including “In Search of,” 
“The Stronger” and “... there was a Girl,” 
Kanishcheva said. These are some of the gal -
lery’s performance-based shows, playing to 
the blend of performance and fine arts em -
braced by Black C Art Gallery staff. She said 
some of these shows will be brought back 
this year after the “Glacial Waste’ exhibition.
“It’s a combination of fine arts and per -
forming arts here in the gallery, and I really 
like that because I see many ways how I 
could implement something more experi -
mental or theatrical,” she said. 
She also said COVID-19 safety guidelines 
like masking, social distancing, and limited-
capacity events are in place.
The gallery is open Monday to Friday 
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Collier said. Visitors 
can also see the gallery by appointment by 
emailing blackcproductions@gmail.com.

STUDENTS ENDURE 
OBSTACLES WITH TIME 
ZONE DIFFERENCES
By Abigail Hasebroock
Alligator Staff Writer
An alarm blared at 4:45 a.m. in 
Oulu, Finland, jolting Meri Karioja 
to wake up for a proctored physics 
exam in 15 minutes. 
She rolled out of bed and scram -
bled to scarf down protein-packed 
peanut butter and chia seed over -
night oats before groggily making 
her way to her desk in the living 
room. The calculator, scratch paper 
and photo ID she laid out the night 
before awaited her. 
Her cat, Filip, meowed as she 
launched her exam, upset about be -
ing locked away in Meri’s bedroom. 
The 21-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology junior 
mustered up the strength to endure 
the two-hour exam before throwing 
herself back under her covers. She 
slept for another three hours, then 
peeled herself out of bed again for a 
six-hour shift at work. 
Karioja said the experience felt 
like being jet-lagged after a long 
flight.
When the arrival of the COV -
ID-19 pandemic last March forced 
a campus shut down, UF students 
and faculty fled home to complete 
classes and work remotely. Some 
international students like Karioja 
have yet to return to campus. 
Completing coursework online 
poses challenges for students and instructors alike, but these issues 
are heightened for some interna -
tional students who attend classes 
and take exams amid drastic time 
zone differences. 
Only 302 out of about 700 incom -
ing Spring international students 
who were issued I-20 forms, which 
allow them to apply for F-1 student 
visas, actually entered the United 
States, checked in and registered 
full time for the semester, Martine 
Angrand, UF’s International Center 
director of F-1 International Student 
Compliance Services, wrote in an 
email.
The approximately 400 students 
who did not enter the country either 
deferred to a future semester, en -
rolled in at least one course while 
remaining abroad or chose to at -
tend another university, which sub -
sequently canceled their I-20s, she 
wrote. 
Though he could not provide 
exact numbers, the dean of UF’s 
International Center, Leonardo Vil -
lalón, said he is certain there was an 
increase in the number of interna -
tional students who are remaining 
at home this academic year. 
“Under normal circumstances, 
it’s very, very few,” he said. “If 
any.” 
Karioja said the physics exam 
she took was originally scheduled 
for 3 a.m., but she asked for it to 
be pushed back, and it was — by 
two hours. She said her professor 
wanted to prevent any academic 
dishonesty.
“Luckily, I woke up,” she said. 
“I was stressed out that I wouldn’t.”About 8,000 miles away from 
The Swamp, Yile Shi is navigating 
a similar fate. The 19-year-old UF 
education sciences sophomore’s 
first year on campus was cut short 
after she moved back to her home 
in Liyang, China, in March 2020. 
The city is 12 hours ahead of 
Gainesville, which poses a chal -
lenge for Shi’s synchronous classes. 
In the Fall, she had a class that met 
at 5 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday, she said.
“Some classes begin at 4 or 5 
a.m., which really kills me,” she 
said. “It means I will be sleepy for 
the whole day.” 
This Spring, Shi has a class that 
meets from 11:40 p.m. to 12:30 
a.m. three times a week. While she 
doesn’t mind going to bed late, she 
stays home on those evenings be -
cause she has to complete school -
work before class begins. Even her 
eating schedule is disrupted. 
“I have to get home early, and 
eat my dinner early,” she said. “For 
these three days, I cannot go out 
and hang out with my friends.”
Though she said all of her pro -
fessors have been understanding, 
Shi still struggles with technological 
issues out of her and her professors’ 
control. The Chinese government 
doesn’t allow citizens to view for -
eign platforms and websites, so she 
said she had to purchase an expen -
sive virtual private network in or -
der to log into Canvas and perform 
Google searches, which isn’t always 
reliable. 
“When I am having a Zoom 
class, I always suddenly lose my In -ternet connection,” she said. 
Villalón said international stu -
dents possess the same access to 
everything residential students 
have, but they may be less aware 
of how to use the available services. 
The center works to pinpoint the 
students’ exact needs and then con -
nect them with the appropriate of -
fice or resource, but he said there 
are many logistical issues beyond 
the center’s control. 
“Those are just the realities of in -
ternational work,” he said. 
Ultimately, the best remedy is a 
safe return to Gainesville, which Shi 
desires more than anything.
“I really miss the campus, hang -
ing out with my friends, taking 
courses in class physically,” she 
said. “I really hope to get back to 
UF as soon as possible.” 
Like Shi, Saranya Aphornsuvan 
is also familiar with burning the 
midnight oil. The 21-year-old UF 
psychology sophomore remained 
in Bangkok, Thailand, from March 
2020 until her return to campus in 
January, she said. 
Thailand is 11 or 12 hours ahead 
of Gainesville, depending on day -
light saving time, she said. Finish -
ing her Spring 2020 semester meant 
attending Zoom lectures after mid -
night every day of the week. 
Aphornsuvan said keeping her 
brain active and accurately process -
ing information was draining, es -
pecially in comparison to her peers 
who were attending class while the 
sun was still high in the sky. 
“When it’s at the end of the day, 
even if you try to schedule to carve out time for class, your biological 
clock won’t register it,” she said. 
Some of her classes, like Spanish, 
were primarily discussion-based, so 
she said she found herself having to 
participate in class conversations. 
“Trying to speak a different lan -
guage is so much harder to do at 
night when you’re just exhausted,” 
she said. 
Though she said she did not 
mind being at home with her par -
ents and dog, Mocca, Aphornsu -
van said finding motivation was 
impossible because she had no one 
physically around her who was 
also studying for classes. She found 
herself getting distracted by little 
things like gazing out her bedroom 
window or spinning around on her 
chair. 
“Being in the classroom, it’s 
much harder to distract yourself,” 
she said. 
The hope produced by the ar -
rival of the COVID-19 vaccine influ -
enced Aphornsuvan to travel back 
to Gainesville where she now lives 
and takes classes. One class is in 
person, which she said she excit -
edly marched into on the first day 
of class. 
Aphornsuvan said she doesn’t 
feel as isolated anymore, and she 
even appreciates when she hears 
people complain about assignments 
and homework. 
“You never know what you have 
until it’s gone,” she said.

EACH HOUSEHOLD IS 
LIMITED TO 
$15,000 OF ASSISTANCE
By Jiselle Lee
Alligator Staff Writer
Alachua County opened appli -
cations for an Emergency Rental 
Assistance Program March 15.
After receiving a federal grant 
of $8.1 million in funds for a rental 
assistance program in January, the 
county launched the program to as -
sist households struggling due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
It can assist eligible households, 
specifically those below the 80% 
median income, with the payment 
of late rent and utilities, or pay the 
rent in advance.
The Treasury Department pro -
vided this grant to Alachua County 
and other counties across the na -
tion as a part of the COVID-19 re -
lief bill signed by former President 
Donald Trump, which included the 
CDC’s eviction moratorium that 
President Joe Biden extended to 
March 31.
People who seek financial help 
must be directly impacted by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, Alachua 
County Communications Director 
Mark Sexton said. According to the 
program’s application page, one or 
more adults in the household must 
have qualified for unemployment 
benefits or experienced a reduction 
in household income on or after 
March 13, 2020.
“It’s not something that’s going 
to assist somebody who has been 
having financial difficulties, stem -
ming back before COVID,” Sexton 
said.
The county is expected to fol -
low strict federal guidelines limiting 
counties to cover only eligible rent -
ers below 80% of median income in 
the area and prioritize those below 
50% of median income in the area, 
he said. These guidelines would 
limit the eligible recipients of the rent aid to, for example, a house -
hold size of four people who have a 
combined income of $55,850.
The money will not be handed 
over to the renters themselves. In -
stead, the county will send the re -
quested payments directly to the 
landlords, property managers and 
utility companies.
Regardless of the household 
size, each household is limited to 
$15,000 of assistance. However, 
the limit may change based on the 
demand for assistance from the 
program, Sexton said.
He said more than 1,000 people 
have completed, started or are in 
the process of finishing registration 
for the rental assistance program, 
as of Tuesday night.
“Fifteen thousand dollars would 
be life-changing for a lot of these 
households,” said Chair of the Ala -
chua County Labor Coalition Jer -
emiah Tattersall. “It would mean 
that they don’t have to make the 
decision between food and housing 
or health care and housing.”
The County Labor Coalition 
has a housing committee focusing 
on renters rights issues through an 
eviction resistance task force that 
helps people continue to live in 
their homes.
The coalition connects citizens 
who filed for evictions to informa -
tion about the CDC eviction mora -
torium, the CARES Act Fund, the 
ERAP and contact information with 
Three Rivers Legal Services, an af -
fordable legal service assisting low -
er-income Florida residents.
These services and grants, espe -
cially the CDC eviction moratorium, 
keep hundreds if not thousands of 
Alachua County citizens from fac -
ing eviction, Tattersall said.
Kai Christmas, a 24-year-old 
Gainesville resident, co-founded 
Gainesville COVID-19 Mutual Aid, 
a Facebook group allowing resi -
dents to give or receive help, after 
they saw the need for community 
outreach about one year ago.
Since then, Christmas has spo -ken with dozens of Gainesville 
citizens in need of monetary as -
sistance to get them a hotel for the 
night or food to get them through 
the day.
“As COVID was starting to take 
hold in our community, we knew 
that it would have a disproportion -
ate effect on our most marginalized 
community members,” they said.
The Facebook group receives a 
lot of posts from homeless people 
as well, Christmas said.
“I don’t see any way that this 
program addresses our houseless 
neighbors,” they said. “And that’s 
one huge area that I would say 
needs additional resources.”
One member of the Facebook 
group, 51-year-old Gainesville 
resident Shanna Johnson, said she 
joined the group in May 2020 to 
become a helper within the com -
munity.
Since the start of the pandemic, 
she made an effort to help residents 
obtain food through the Civic Me -
dia Center and share COVID-19 re -
sources from Indivisible Gainesville 
with community members in the 
Facebook group.
“I really think this kind of ac -
tion needed to happen sooner,” 
Johnson said. “I know there’s a lot 
of things that go into getting this 
done, but I just feel like it didn’t 
have to be so hard for so many.”
She said she’s noticed many 
calls for help securing shelter and 
hotel rooms within the group. By 
sharing the link to ERAP’s registra -
tion page, she hoped it would help 
someone who risks losing housing 
or is trying to get housing.
Johnson pointed out that the ap -
plication is online, which might be 
inconvenient for people who do not 
have easy access to the internet.
“I feel like the people who need 
the help usually have the least 
amount of resources,” she said.

BASEBALLAFTER MORE THAN HALF THE 
SEASON, FLORIDA’S SECOND 
CENTER MIDFIELDER IS STILL NOT 
LOCKED DOWN
By Myles Herbert
Sports Writer
As Florida hit Donald R. Dizney Stadium 
for an extended spring season, head coach 
Becky Burleigh began experimenting.
 Through four games and one exhibition 
in the spring, Florida has played in a 4-4-2 
religiously, a change from the 4-2-3-1 which 
Burleigh heavily frequented in 2019 and the 
fall of 2020.
Burleigh picked three different midfield 
pairings through the five matches the team 
played. 
Redshirt senior midfielder Parker Roberts 
remained the Gators’ constant. She started 
next to Laney Steed in the opener against Col -
lege of Charleston, midfielders Cameron Hall 
against USF and FSU and Ava Kuyken against 
Georgia Southern and LSU.
Roberts has started every match and 
played 336 of 380 minutes, the most of any 
outfield player. The 2020 all-SEC second-team 
player racked up two goals, two assists and a 
goal contribution of .84 per 90 minutes. 
Roberts’ strength lies in her ability to sit 
in front of the back four and deliver passes 
across the field. This allows her midfield part -
ner to focus on other aspects aside from distri -
bution: think the role that Chelsea midfielder 
Jorginho fit in while he played under Mauri -
cio Sarri at both Napoli and Chelsea-ish. 
Two midfielders usually accompany a 
player in this role on either side. These two 
play a “shuttler” role, someone who’s very 
active and transitions the ball forward in a 
4-3-3 or 4-4-2 diamond. It’s unusual to see this type of midfield 
system play out in a 4-4-2 wide, so it begs 
the question — who should partner her in 
midfield?
When it's sophomore midfielder Laney 
Steed, Florida keeps its best two passers at the 
center of the pitch. 
With them, the Gators should have gener -
ated more chances, but this wasn’t the case 
against College of Charleston. In the first half, 
both goals came off set pieces. While the 
Gators controlled the match, they couldn’t 
link up play well enough in the opposition’s 
third. 
Florida produced five shots at the half. To 
start the second half, Steed moved to left mid -
field. This distributed the creativity through 
the team more equally with a threat out wide. 
Florida then accumulated nine shots and 
added three goals. Steed worked wonders out 
wide, opening the offense with passes from 
the wing.
The next two matches Florida played were 
against its best opponents: No. 18 South Flor -
ida and No. 1 Florida State. Florida managed 
two scoreless draws against them. 
After the teams’ second half against 
Charleston, Steed started both matches out 
wide, and allowed Hall to come into the mid -
field. 
While the formation stayed the same, Flor -
ida played more defensively. 
Hall and Roberts needed to organize the 
midfield in front of the defense because they 
would be backpedalling. They stifled the op -
position’s attack somewhat yet still couldn’t 
nullify their shot and chance creations com -
pletely. 
Florida was outshot 27-9 across the two 
matches, but held onto clean sheets due to 
the back line’s defense.
In the game against USF, Hall received 
a red card and a two-game suspension. It counted toward the first match against Geor -
gia Southern because the FSU game was an 
exhibition.  
This brought Kuyken into the midfield, 
and the England youth international shifted 
how the formation worked. 
The team started out in its 4-4-2, but as 
the game against GSU played out, it shifted 
to more of a 4-1-2-1-2 with Kuyken playing 
box-to-box. 
As Florida controlled the game, the play -
making ran through her and Roberts handled 
more defensive duties.
Florida recorded 37 shots in the game with 
19 on target and much of this had to do with 
Kuyken. 
Her movement off-ball and ability to link play in tight spaces made it easy for herself 
and her teammates. It generated space that 
they could use to progress the ball either out 
wide to Steed and Nicole Vernis or through 
the middle. 
While the Gators created their most shots 
in games where Kuyken started, one weak -
ness glared against GSU in particular. 
When making her way up the pitch to 
occupy advanced attacking positions, space 
opened up behind her that  teams could 
capitalize on. Opponents can wait for her to 
receive the ball and use that as a trigger to 
press. 
It is currently unclear who will take up the 
helm at Florida before the fall but one thing is 
certain is that they will have their choice on 
who starts in their midfield.

NEARLY HALF OF THE GATORS’ ROSTER NEVER 
PLAYED IN AN SEC GAME UNTIL THE WEEKEND
By Sara Kate Dyson
Sports Writer 
As the first crack of the bat rang throughout Florida Ball -
park on SEC Opening Weekend, so did the bundle of ex -
citement and nerves that encompasses baseball in March. 
In the first inning with two outs, Nathan Hickey 
whizzed a double down the left-field line. The hit marked 
the first for the Gators in SEC play this year, and Hickey’s 
first against a conference opponent in his second year on 
the team. 
Nearly one year ago, the Gators baseball team sat in the 
clubhouse at Alfred A McKethan Stadium and prepared to 
open SEC play against Georgia. Then, the world stopped, 
and so did baseball. 
Florida didn’t play a single SEC game that spring. 
This year, the Gators hosted SEC Opening Weekend against Texas A&M. The series marked the first time Flor -
ida faced a conference opponent since its one-game battle 
against Georgia Nov. 1. It became the first full three-game 
SEC series the team played since May 2019. 
The SEC often features the highest level of competition 
in college baseball. This week, the top-four ranked teams 
belonged to the SEC. Nearly half the team experienced the 
SEC’s intensity for the first time. 
Last season’s freshmen, dubbed “COVID freshmen,” it’s 
a belated start to a rite of passage they lost. To this year’s, 
it’s a sudden change of pace from what they were growing 
accustomed to.  
The first few weeks of Florida’s college baseball sea -
son included games against out-of-conference and usually 
unranked opponents. The opening weeks gave the players 
and head coach Kevin O’Sullivan the opportunity to tin -
ker with the lineup and find a system that works — all in 
preparation for the start of conference play. 
Due to the extended layoff, O’Sullivan doesn’t have all 
the answers set for this team. Twenty-two of 39 players on the roster are new to conference play, and the coach 
took longer to figure out what putting his best foot forward 
meant for this team. 
First-year freshman catcher Mac Guscette caught for 
fourth-year starting pitcher Tommy Mace to open SEC play 
on Thursday night. Guscette hasn’t been the go-to starter 
behind the plate all season, but he made a name for him -
self in the conference with his offensive prowess. 
The nerves surfaced, Guscette said, as he squatted be -
hind the plate for the first time, but they soon disappeared 
as the game went on. So much became obvious after he 
slapped both a double and a single down the left field line 
in two at-bats in the same inning. 
“Catching Tommy knowing he’s been through this, it 
kind of helped me, he talked me through it,” Guscette said.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
TURNOVERS AND POOR CLOCK MANAGEMENT 
SPOILED UF’S NCAA TOURNAMENT RUN
By River Wells
Sports Writer
 
Colin Castleton nailed his second free throw and built 
Florida’s lead to six points. He strode back to defense. 
There were six minutes left before the Sweet 16. 
In the city that hosts the electrifyingly fast Indianapolis 
500, Gators head coach Mike White slowed things down.
The clock ticked, and the Gators idled. Their seven-
point lead dwindled until a three-point shot from Oral 
Roberts forward DeShang Weaver put the Golden Eagles 
up 80-78 late in the game.
The Gators never regained their lead and saw their sea -
son come to an end when the 15th-seeded Oral Roberts 
knocked off 7th-seeded Florida 81-78 to advance in the 
NCAA Tournament.
“We were tired,” White said. “I thought that part of 
slowing it down would help us settle in with some of the 
erratic decisions that we were making offensively.” 
Oral Roberts is the second 15-seed to make it to the 
Sweet 16 after FGCU in 2013. The win over Florida was 
ORU’s second March Madness win since 1974.
You don’t know how good they are until you actually 
play them,” Sophomore guard Tre Mann said.
Florida entered the game favored by nine points, ac -
cording to SportsLine. Yet Oral Roberts exploited faults 
in White’s strategy. That ill-fated three with two minutes 
and nine seconds left was the Golden Eagles’ first lead in 
the second half. But there are more reasons why Florida’s 
dance is over and Oral Roberts’ Cinderella story continues.
The Gators shot 7 for 9 from the foul line compared to 
Oral Roberts 19 for23, but turnovers and poor clock man -
agement spun UF off course, too. Oral Roberts preyed on Florida and gave up possession after possession. 
Florida turned the ball over a staggering 10 times in the 
first half and made matters worse by turning the ball over 
another 10 times in the second half. Oral Roberts finished 
with 12 total turnovers.
Every UF player who touched a basketball in the first 
half turned it over at least once. Four players ended with 
at least three turnovers. Mann claimed four, and junior 
forward Colin Castleton had five.
“To me it was a mentality that this team, unfortunate -
ly, never fully embraced the importance, unfortunately, of 
each possession,” White said. 
Over the two games in the NCAA Tournament, the 
Golden Eagles’ turnover ratio is +18. They ruined mil -
lions of brackets in their win against Ohio State by win -
ning the turnover battle 16-6.
Florida struggled with keeping the basketball all year. 
This season, Florida had a turnover rate of 23.2% in half-
court. When operating in the last 21-30 seconds of the shot 
clock, it turned the ball over a staggering 24.6% of the 
time, according to GatorsTerritory’s Eric Fawcett.
With that turnover rate from Florida in half-court, the 
strategy Oral Roberts implemented became simple. When 
Florida wasted time with the basketball, it was only more 
likely to turn the ball over — especially when it’s sub -
sequently forced to rush at the end of the game, as that 
24.6% turnover rate would indicate.
Oral Roberts played aggressive all night, and when 
faced with the opportunity to cash in on Florida’s turn -
overs, it didn’t waste time. The Golden Eagles scored 23 
points off of turnovers and scored 16 points in the last six 
minutes. Florida, as it tried to milk the clock, only scored 
seven and attempted eight field goals.
Florida fans made no attempts to hide their clamoring 
for White’s job after consistent bounces from the SEC and 
NCAA Tournaments. White may have opted to eat up the clock toward the end of the game, but the six-year head 
coach’s time may be running out soon.
I’m crushed right now,” White said. “It’s been a long 
year. It’s been a really long year.”
