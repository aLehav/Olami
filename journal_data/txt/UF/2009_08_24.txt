UF climbed two spots in both 
the national and public school 
standings in the U.S. News & World Report 2010 rankings.
UF moved from 17th to 15th 
on the U.S. News & World Re-port’s 2010 Top Public National 
Universities ranking and from 
49th to 47th in the National Uni-versities ranking.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said UF improved its average freshmen retention rate, student-faculty ratio and acceptance rate.
“Given all the budget con-straints we had, a lot of people 
thought we would fall this year,” Orlando said. 
Jordan Johnson, UF’s Student 
Body president, said UF’s rise was due in part to the UF com-munity’s decision to face the chal-lenge of budget cuts head-on.
“We really came together, and 
we made compromises that were 
in the best interest of the univer-
sity in moving forward,” Johnson said. “We have to keep preaching the idea that, look, we’re going to make it through this, we’re 
going to make it out better than 
we came in, and the education at UF will not compromise to a bad economy.”Despite this optimism, UF’s 
performance slipped in some ar-eas of the ranking assessment, 
including expected graduation 
rate, financial resources rank and the number of freshmen from the top 10 percent of their high school classes.

If tuition included a personal tour guide, 
navigating a new school would be simple. 
Fortunately, new Gators can benefit from the 
next best thing.
The ninth annual UF Ask Me campaign 
kicked off Sunday and will continue through Tuesday. 
The campaign, sponsored by the UF divi-
sions of Business Affairs, Student Affairs and 
Human Resources, offers help at residence 
halls during check-in and other campus loca-
tions to help make the first days on campus 
less confusing for new students.

A pedestrian on UF’s Stadium Road Friday 
afternoon may have mistaken the swarm of freshmen for a new military branch.
But instead of Army fatigues, most of them 
sported flip-flops and shorts.About 6,000 new Gators gathered in the 
O’Connell Center for New Student Convoca-tion and Navigating the Swamp, an event that hasn’t been held in years and has never been held for the entire incoming class, according to Dean of Students Office spokeswoman Ann 
Ho Becks.
The event, which lasted about three hours, 
featured speeches from UF President Bernie Machen and Luis Alberto Urrea, author of 
the current Common Reading Program book, “The Devil’s Highway.”
The morning kicked off with the convoca-
tion portion, during which students took part in a pinning ceremony to symbolize their wel-
coming into the university. Freshman business 
major Sophie Perez was pinned on stage, and the rest of the students pinned those around them.
After the convocation, the mass broke into 
groups by college for about two hours, and faculty led discussions on the Common Read-ing Program book and on how to succeed in different programs.
According to Becks, the event received pos-
itive feedback, and UF plans to continue the event in the future. New students come together in welcoming ceremonyUFAcademic s

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — A large wave 
fueled by Hurricane Bill swept a group of surf-
watchers into the sea at a Maine park Sunday, including a 7-year-old girl who died after the Coast Guard pulled her from the waters.
The girl, her father and a 12-year-old girl 
who were all visiting Acadia National Park were plucked from the water by rescuers. The man and the 12-year-old were hospitalized.
The three were part of an afternoon crowd 
of thousands who lined the national park's rocky shoreline to watch the high surf and crashing waves, which were "absolutely the ef-fects of Hurricane Bill" coupled with the effect of high tide, park ranger Sonya Berger said.
The hurricane was also blamed for the 
death of a 54-year-old swimmer Saturday in Florida. Volusia County Beach Patrol Capt. Scott Petersohn said Angel Rosa of Orlando washed ashore unconscious near rough waves fueled by Bill at New Smyrna Beach. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.Hurricane Bill blamed in deaths in Maine, Fla.

Swine flu ‘care packages’ assembled for college campuses
BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) — 
Some Florida universities are pre-
paring care packages for students 
who come down with swine flu on campus.
Federal health officials have one of the men 13 times on July 9, the day of the killings, pleading for his help.
Gonzalez’s stepmother told 
investigators that he persuaded 
his 56-year-old father to drive 
the getaway car by telling him that the Billings’ children were being sexually abused.
“He just said they were gonna 
go do a job on a pervert,” Leon-ard Patrick Gonzalez Sr.’s wife told investigators. She said her husband “doesn’t like it when 
they play with little kids.”
The documents reveal other 
links among the suspects, though 
it remains unclear exactly how each was recruited.
Besides the Gonzalezes, also 
charged are Wayne Coldiron, 41, Donnie Ray Stallworth, 28, Gary Lamont Sumner Jr., 30, Frederick 
Lee Thornton Jr., 19, and Rakeem 
Florence, 16.

Florida State University will 
offer a care package online for 
parents to send. The packs will include thermometers, soup, ginger ale, tea, muffins and possibly hand sanitizer and a face mask.
A UF pack could include Ga-
torade along with health items. Similar kits will be given to stu-dents who visit Florida Atlantic University’s health clinic.

Links among 7 suspects in 
slayings of Fla. couple 
PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — 
Seven suspects charged in the 
shooting deaths of a Florida Panhandle couple appear to be a hastily assembled group lured by the promise of money, according to documents re-leased by prosecutors.
Six men and a 16-year-old 
charged as an adult have plead-ed not guilty to first-degree murder in last month’s slayings of Byrd and Melanie Billings, who were known for adopting several children with special needs. In the weeks before the attack, Leonard Patrick Gonza-
lez Jr., 35, identified by authori-
ties as the “mastermind,” asked a few friends to drive a getaway car for a robbery, according to the documents. Gonzalez called

Cheap or easy — when it comes 
to buying textbooks, you usually 
can’t have both. 
Students have to weigh the con-
venience of buying locally against 
deals available online.
Scott Laming, public relations 
coordinator for abebooks.com, said 
buying textbooks online is usually cheaper because online vendors ca-ter to a national market. The greater customer base allows vendors to purchase their supplies of books in bulk, often at discount prices.  
“Smaller local bookstores just 
don’t have the same buying power and can’t get the same prices that we do,” Laming said.
In addition, online vendors do 
not have to pay to operate a store-front, keeping prices low.
But Laming said students who 
need a book immediately usually buy it locally rather than waiting or paying to expedite shipping.
Also, if a professor makes any 
last-minute changes to the syllabus, students who purchased online are stuck with a book they no longer need. Buying locally makes returns and exchanges easier. 
Buying from the UF Bookstore 
allows students with financial aid to defer textbook costs until financial 
aid is disbursed.
Peter Shekailo, a UF microbiolo-gy senior, bought his textbooks from 
the UF Bookstore because of the con-venience of the deferment program.  
“Here I can just slide my [Gator 1 
Card],” he said.
Even though the books may be 
more expensive than buying them online, Shekailo said he doesn’t mind because he is paying for books with scholarships.
“I’m not supplying the money 
I’m using,” he said. If he went else-where, he would pay out of pocket and wait to be reimbursed.
The UF Bookstore also offers 
digital copies of some textbooks at a lower price. Director Lynne Vaughan said a student can pur-chase a code that, when entered online, downloads the textbook to a computer. The copy expires after 180 days and cannot be sold back.
The campus bookstore also hosts 
the UF Book Market on its Web site, allowing students to post classified ads to sell used books at a price they set. Buyers can search the listings and purchase directly from other students.
While buying used is generally 
cheaper, it’s not always feasible.
Keith Cox, manager at Orange 
and Blue Textbooks, said some stu-dents have to buy new books if their courses have an online component. This coursework is accessed with a code provided in new copies.
According to Vaughan, early 
shoppers tend to buy all the used books first, forcing others to buy new.
Brittany Hicks, a materials sci-
ence and engineering freshman, purchased two calculus books from the UF Bookstore. She bought her other books online through amazon.com, but was unable to find the last two on the site.  
The campus bookstore did not 
have used copies of the books she needed, so she bought them new.
“At that point I just wanted to 
have them,” she said.
� SO FAR, 105 RAs HAVE BEEN 
ASSIGNED A ROOMMATE.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Zumaly Dixon snuggles in her dorm bed 
while on her laptop as a Harry Potter movie 
plays in the background. 
Dixon is a resident assistant, but she isn’t 
listening to the movie alone — freshman Vic-
toria Brathwaite sits across from her RA in a 
temporary bed watching, too. 
For the first time in at least 25 years, UF RAs have assigned roommates as part of a housing overflow procedure, according to Sharon Blansett, assistant director of housing 
for research and organizational development. 
Previously, UF housed students in lounges or made off-campus living arrangements.
But at 104 percent capacity this year — the 
highest in UF history — more residents are be-ing doubled or tripled to offset demand. 
The new living arrangements are tempo-
rary, lasting for two to three weeks until some residents cancel their leases.
“It affects the [expectations] of the job, but 
I don’t mind,” said Dixon, a marketing sopho-more.Out of 183 UF RAs, 105 RAs have been 
assigned a roommate. Rawlings Hall RA Akeelah Ammons is one of the 78 RAs who 
continue to enjoy single rooms. 
“It must be tough because you’re not used 
to having a roommate,” said 
Ammons, a fifth-year dietetics major. “I’m using my room as a refuge for them and the hall.”
Prior to move-in, students were notified 
via e-mail about temporarily living with a resi-dent assistant.  
“I feel bad because [having your own 
room] is one of the perks of being an RA,” said Brathwaite, a biology major. Some students can only imagine what it 
would be like living with their hall RA.  
“That’s weird because if you go out party-
ing or something your RA is watching your back,” said Ansuya Deosaran, a freshman bi-ology major. “I would rather have a triple than living with [an] RA.”
Broward Hall RA Nabil Abazaid also has a 
freshman roommate in his dorm. He believes having a roommate may send the wrong mes-sage to others in his hall. 
“It takes away the authority aspect of being 
an RA,” said Abazaid, a sophomore health sci-ence major. “You want to be friendly enough to them but also have respect for the rules.” AROUND GAINESVILLE

UF’s lawyers have responded to 
claims of racial and sexual discrimi-
nation made in a lawsuit earlier this year by former associate professor of law Sherrie Russell-Brown.
In documents filed Aug. 7 and 
10, UF denies it discriminated against her and asks the court to dismiss the case.
In her lawsuit, Russell-Brown, 
who is black, alleges UF fostered a hostile atmosphere that resulted in harassment by students and faculty and that the university ultimately 
forced her from her job. 
In one instance, she alleges she 
was talking with a black student 
when a male colleague hit her from behind, pushing her into the class-room’s whiteboard as class was about to start and students were taking their seats.
In another, she said a white male 
student in one of her classes sent her a threatening e-mail the day after the Virginia Tech killings. The e-mail stated there would be some-thing waiting for her when she ar-rived at the classroom, leading her to cancel the last day of class, ac-cording to the lawsuit.
She that alleges faculty members were told to avoid her and that UF forced her to leave in retaliation for submitting discrimination com-plaints.
Her lawsuit was first filed in 
Alachua County in February and 
then re-filed in New Jersey, where 
she lives, in May.
In its response to the lawsuit, 
UF states that if students or faculty avoided or harassed her it was done without its knowledge or approval.  
UF alleges Russell-Brown resigned willingly after she was told her con-tract would not be renewed.
In court documents, Bob Jerry, 
dean of the law school, stated the university wanted to let her go be-cause she could not be relied on to teach her assigned classes.
Jerry asserted that Russell-
Brown e-mailed him about a week before the start of classes in the fall of 2007 informing him that she had 
an “unexpected illness” and that she couldn’t teach the first week of class.  
Jerry asked her to report back to 
him in a few days to let him know if she would be able to fulfill her teaching obligations for the semes-ter, UF’s response alleges.
When she didn’t report back 
and attempts to contact her failed, the law school reassigned her class, according to the response.
After a series of e-mails and 
phone calls, the law school offered her another class that would start in late September. She declined, stating there wasn’t enough time 
left to properly teach the class.  
However, she offered to teach the 
class in the spring and proposed a class description that included four essays and no class meetings.
UF alleges that the law school 
found this unacceptable and yet she continued to try to avoid face-to-face teaching.
“Face-to-face teaching of stu-dents was an essential function of Russell-Brown’s position,” Jerry stated in court documents.
The lawsuit notes that 
Russell-Brown was living in Plainfield, N.J., at the time.  
By the end of September, when Russell-Brown had still not met with the dean about her situation and had not turned in proper medi-cal documentation to excuse her from work, Jerry stated the school decided not to renew her contract, which resulted in her resignation.
According to court documents, 
Russell-Brown put the school in a similar situation in 2005 when, a week before fall classes, she in-formed the law school she couldn’t teach that semester because of a medical condition.
She was living in England 
at the time, working on a de-gree in public international law 
at the University of Oxford.  A medical form filed with UF in the 
fall of 2007 indicates she began ex-periencing irregular heartbeats and chest pain in 2005.
Russell-Brown resigned from UF 
effective Dec. 31, 2007. She received 
almost $121,000 in compensation, 
totaling more than a year’s worth of salary and health benefits.
She also agreed not to file any 
lawsuits or other complaints against UF for incidents that occurred be-fore the contract was signed, which UF alleges should be grounds for dismissal of the suit.
Her lawsuit seeks monetary 
compensation and reinstatement at UF.
UF officials declined to com-
ment, citing university policy that prevents them from talking about ongoing lawsuits.
On Aug. 11, a statement from the 
dean about diversity was posted on 
the law school’s Web site.
“[T]he measure of an institution 
or a community is not the isolated 
acts of behavior of one or a few members of that community…,” Jerry’s statement reads. “Like any responsible institution, we inves-tigate any incidents of alleged dis-crimination brought to our atten-
tion and, while every allegation is 
not true, if it is we respond appro-priately,” it said.

Jessica Warshaver / Alligator Staff� IT WAS HOME TO ABOUT 
200,000 BATS.
By THOMAS STEWART
 Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
After years of housing too 
many bats, part of UF’s bat house 
collapsed Aug. 16.
As a result, UF could end up 
spending about $10,000 on re-
pairs, and the campus could see 
an influx of homeless bats tak-ing up residence in the attics and crevices of its buildings, said Ken Glover, UF’s pest management co-ordinator.
The house, located on Museum 
Road across from Lake Alice, was home to an estimated 200,000 bats 
that weighed in at nearly 1 ton, 
Glover said. The structure’s roost-ing fins, a series of plywood boxes attached to the inside of the roof, fell to the ground, killing about 100 bats, he said.
“They just overloaded the 
roofing structure,” he said.  
The rest of the bats had already 
left the house for the night to seek 
food, he said. No people were in-jured.
Glover recovered about 80 dead 
bats on Aug. 17 to be examined by the Florida Museum of Natural History at the museum’s request.
It’s not clear when it collapsed, 
but Glover said he was notified around 8:30 p.m.He said the structure can 
still house about 100,000 bats.  
The partial collapse could renew talks of building a new bat house, Glover said.The colony of bats has grown 
too large for the house in recent years, which has led bats to form small colonies in on-campus buildings like Larson HallA new bat house could cost 
about $60,000, he said, and might take four to six weeks to build.
If UF decides to build a new 
bat house, funding will be sought from various sources, he said. The UF Foundation, which handles donations to UF, and the Florida Bat Conservancy are two potential sources of funding.
In the meantime, the money for 
repairs will likely come from UF’s building maintenance budget, he 
said.
The bat house was built in 1991 
at a cost of about $20,000 to relieve 
the bat infestation at Percy Beard Track.
The bats began living in the 
concrete stands after Johnson Hall, UF’s old cafeteria, burned down in 1987, he said. Before the fire, 
a couple thousand bats had been 
living in the attic of the building, which was located at the site of the current Academic Advising Center.
For reasons that are still un-
clear, the bats didn’t start living in the structure until 1995.
With the possibility that more 
bats could migrate to campus buildings, Glover said it is impor-tant that people don’t try to touch the bats if they see them.
Many bats carry rabies, he said, 
which can be deadly.
He urged anyone who finds 
a bat on campus from 8 a.m. to 5 
p.m. to call UF’s pest control at 
352-392-1904. For after-hours bat discoveries, he said, the Universi-ty Police Department can be noti-
fied by calling 352-392-1111.

Want to hang at our house? Well, Friday is your 
chance. ‘Cause it’s Friday. You ain’t got no job, and you ain’t got shit to do.
But seriously, the Alligator will open its doors to stu-
dents this Friday from 2 to 5 p.m. for the first of many open houses of the semester. We asked about getting a keg, but unfortunately we’ll only have pizza to offer.
We are (desperately) searching for a metro editor to 
assign all city-related stories to our whopping one city writer. Yeah, we need those too.
Metro attire isn’t required for the metro editor, but we 
do ask that applicants know — or are vaguely familiar with — the difference between the county and city com-mission. Bonus points to any applicant that can accurate-ly spell our mayor’s name.
Alligator.org will also get a major makeover with-
in the next two weeks — we’re looking forward to a snazzier design, more online projects and multimedia.  
Our woefully tiny online staff is looking for anyone inter-ested in making the new site awesome, whether you’re into programming, Web design or video.
In addition to a metro editor and an online staff, we’re 
on the hunt for multimedia gurus, photographers, writ-ers, graphic designers, columnists, copy editors... the list goes on.
So, what is it like to work five days a week at the na-
tion’s largest student-run newspaper?
Believe it or not, it’s fun.Sure, we clock more hours in the newsroom than 
we do sleeping, in class, sleeping in class or doing our homework. But fortunately for us, we’re all in the same classes.
Just kidding... sort of.We give each other back rubs and nurse our poor, already-suffering-from-carpal-tunnel forearms and hands. We watch Jeopardy! religiously ev-ery Monday through Thursday, and text message answers (or rather, questions) to one another during the Friday airing.
We eat here, we study here, we 
sleep here. If there was a shower, we’d likely bathe here, too.
We receive voice mails from puzzled readers con-
cerned about missing Sudoku puzzles and word jum-bles. (Don’t worry, we’re trying our best to bring back ol’ Crossword Lite.)
Since we spend so much time here, we’ve even started 
decorating. The online office now comes complete with a throw cover for the couch Alligator staffers have slept on since 1987.
We also cleaned the newsroom recently, and discov-
ered such gems as an ancient gas mask and a key to the building’s elevator that was missing for two years. We assume the mask belonged to the sole non-smoker who worked here back in the good ol’ days when we could smoke inside the windowless newsroom.
During Friday’s open house, we will conduct on-the-
spot, smoke-free interviews. We suggest you bring your resume and portfolio (which will hopefully be smokin’).
If we like you, you’ll get a call back. If we love you, 
you’ll likely be writing a story for Monday’s edition.
See you Friday!Kristin Bjornsen is a journalism senior and editor in chief

Monday’s question:  The results of Monday’s poll question are unavailable due to technical error.Today’s question: Do students have a right to complain about Bright Futures changes?Dormitory DisasterStill A Future
Tuition increases not the 
end of the world
One of the worst wel-
comes a UF student can receive is “perma-
nent triple.” The second worst welcome they could receive 
would be telling them they 
have to room with a cross be-tween a peer, a Mother Hen and an authority figure.
Due to overcrowding, resi-
dent assistants and regular ol’ dorm dwellers are being paired up in living arrange-ments that we imagine can 
only be described as one half-
step up from Dante’s Inferno.
We wonder why UF keeps 
ignoring its capacity problem. The fact that RAs must give up a major job perk proves the issue isn’t improving.
It’s false advertising. When 
someone is hired for a job, 
they should be aware of what 
they will receive as payment for their duties. Taking away one of the few perks of an RA’s job is the same as hiring someone for $10 an hour and then paying them $7.It’s also unfair to under-
classmen who are stuck in this setup. The UF housing Web site does not mention the pos-sibility of living with someone 
who is essentially in charge of 
you. Underclassmen could move to an off-campus apart-ment if the situation is truly awful. However, they would still have to forfeit their de-posit, which UF refuses to return to those who end their contracts. It’s like buying a 
TV at Wal-Mart, opening the 
box to find a VCR and being refused a refund.
Our hearts go out to the 
RAs who will now watch as half of their rooms are des-ecrated with life-size posters of Tim Tebow, campus maps and other freshman regalia.
And our hearts go out to the 
freshmen who must deal with never having anyone want to hang out in their dorms, ever. But a line of consolation: You won’t have to deal with the post-party mess.Bright Futures recipients still get a hell of a financial break, but this year it won’t be quite as big.
UF students are being asked to take a little responsibil-
ity in financing their higher education, which isn’t as horrible as every groaning 20-year-old on campus might make it seem.
Although it seems disingenuous to tell kids to do well in 
high school and stay in Florida while dangling a later-vanishing carrot in front of their faces, the fact remains that UF’s tuition is still phenomenally low, and the out-of-pocket cost to attend UF is practically nil. So taxpayers will now pay 85 percent of what it costs for you to take “Fruit for Fun and Profit.” Cry us a river.
Times are tough, and everyone is all too aware of the budget 
issues facing our university. But, for some reason, students be-moan the fact that they will have to pay $20 for a credit hour. 
If paying $60 for a college class is too much of a hassle, you 
might need to ask yourself what you’re here for in the first place. A well of knowledge and a possible life-changing experi-ence might cost about the same as a copy of Call of Duty 5, but please, get your priorities straight.
Other states do not get Bright Futures. Next time you’re feel-
ing bummed about the cost of tuition and books, imagine if you were born and raised in Wyoming. Not only would you have to pay for all of your school expenses, you would be in Wyoming. 
See? Thought experiments are good for you.
We do wonder if the solution wouldn’t be to set higher stan-
dards for the Bright Futures scholarship. Getting a 1270 on the 
SAT is hard and all, but we’re not sure if it merits a free ride to college from every old lady with a scratch-off addiction, a poor understanding of probability and a never-ending supply of op-timism. Regardless, having to pay for your own books is not the end of the world. Plus, if scraping together $60 per class each semester is gonna break you, you’re already broke.

To all students new to UF, welcome to the 
next four years of your life. Returning Gators, cut the freshmen some slack and 
welcome back as well. 
We have a lot to look forward to in the next 
year. Whether you’ll be busy cheering on our defending champion Gators football team or studying to be a future leader of the world, I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on the goals my administration has been able accomplish, as well as give you an idea of things you can look forward to this fall. These goals have included everything from secur-ing 300 parking spaces for students in the new 
parking garage to nearly completing the plan 
for an extended-hours study area. 
This summer contained a period of tech-
nological expansion on campus in which we were able to increase the usability of WebMail by including e-mail forwarding to Gmail and Yahoo. We also renovated the Student Gov-ernment Computer Lab to double the number of computers. This will also double the num-
ber of students able to print at one time when 
the lab reopens today.
Another major topic that my administra-
tion has worked tirelessly on is student safety. Facing a rising rate of muggings and bur-glaries in and around campus, I personally worked to shed light on the problem by part-nering with local law enforcement to create an awareness program for the fall semester. My 
administration worked hand in hand with the 
local Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and local law enforcement on the “$103 to Life” Seat Belt cam-paign. My administra-tion was also able to increase the amount of SNAP vans and 
expand operating 
hours to better provide nighttime security for students.
But this is only the 
beginning. This very week my administration will be kicking off the “Be A Smarty, Think Be-fore You Party” campaign. This is a DUI pre-vention campaign that will include the pro-
motion of the newly extended SNAP as well 
as Later Gator bus routes, and the Fabulous Rides scooter pickup service. Starting today, you can call 877-RIDE-UF1 to be connected to our safe ride dispatch to any of these services
But we don’t plan on stopping there. This 
fall we will be tackling sustainability issues like motion sensors, paper recycling, work-ing to increase the number of exercise classes 
available to students and, of course, continu-
ing to represent students like you on the issues that concern you most while still providing quality entertainment and services.
Since my administration took office, we 
have been able to get real results for students, and with your help we can make sure more work is done. With the ingenuity of UF stu-dents and the will to do what must be done, 
we can make our campus a better place. I look 
forward to an exciting year. Go Gators!

Speaking Out This summer, while everyone 
was in a lazy summer mood, I was the girl armed with her 
class schedule, 50 fliers, a campus map and the bus schedule. No, I’m 
NOT a freshman.  I am a transfer 
student. And I’m still a new, small fish in a big, swampy pond.
I’ve been to college before. Hell, 
I’ve actually graduated from college. Starting at a school as big as UF, though, is a totally new experience for me. I feel like I have to start all over. It seems like everyone knows everyone else. People have things to do after class. People know where they’re going. I do not. 
I went to orientation. I listened to 
the speeches (no open containers, no 
kegs, there is a club that helps you 
find other clubs you may want to join, etc.). However, after we got our little orientation bag and compli-mentary pencil, we also got a polite shove out the door.
UF has all of these cutesy little 
handbooks and guides for fresh-men, but transfer students kind of get the short end of the stick. We are new to UF, 
but by now, most of us have figured 
out how to navigate through college 
and all that comes with it. But no one tells you which bus you need to take to get home. No one tells you how to decline the 50 bajillion people hand-ing out fliers on Turlington Plaza. I wasn’t told about the smoking policy on campus, although, judg-ing from how many people gave me the stank-eye as I practically ate my cancer sticks out of stress, smoking is akin to eating small children. 
This fall will be my second se-
mester here, and I still feel like a 
new kid. I’ve moved 12 times in 
my life, once to another continent.When you’re 6, you make friends by marching up to someone on the playground and boom: Before you know it, you’re trading stickers and planning a sleepover. When you’re 22, that doesn’t fly. 
There is nothing wrong with be-ing a freshman — we’ve all been one somewhere. But I have two years of college under my belt — please don’t be condescending when I ask where the nearest Starbucks is!
With the degrading stigma of be-
ing labeled “freshman,” I’m debat-ing whether or not to carry around my AA diploma to flash like an ID card. Or maybe I’ll just suck it up and tell myself that, one day, I’ll stop being the lost little new girl and start giving directions myself.

� HE PROMISED TO RETURN TO IN -
DIA AFTER SERVING HIS SENTENCE.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
 
The UF graduate student charged with 
groping dozens of women on campus while 
pretending to remove bugs from their bodies was sentenced to 180 days in jail earlier this month.
Robin Garg, 23, also received three years 
of probation and promised to return to India when he is released. He was ordered to repay 
the state about $3,500 in investigation costs and about $1,600 in court costs.
Garg, who has been in jail since his arrest 
on April 14, apologized before being sen-
tenced.
“I want to apologize for University of Flor-
ida and all the victims,” he said in his soft-spoken, emotional statement.
“I’m not a bad person,” he said. “I did 
something very bad, and I don’t know why.”
After being arrested earlier this year, Garg 
admitted to police that he groped 33 women on campus. Police later identified 31 women who said they’d been groped by Garg and five others who had been approached by him. 
According to police, in each case Garg told 
the women he wanted to help remove a bug from their bodies. Garg told police he groped them because he “liked to scare women.”
Not all of the women filed complaints.Under an agreement with the state, Garg 
pleaded no contest to five cases of misde-
meanor battery. The state with-held adjudication on one of those cases and agreed not to file formal charges in the other 
20 cases pending against him.
Garg was given credit for 116 days he had 
spent in jail since his arrest. In addition, his attorney, Geoffrey Mason, said the Alachua County jail would likely shave 30 days off his sentence for good behavior. If that is the case, Garg could be released in the first week of September.
Garg faced a maximum sentence of one 
year in prison for each charge against him.
A psychological evaluation determined 
Garg is not a threat to society, Mason said.
Though Garg, who is in the country on a 
student visa, said he will head back to India to finish school and be with his family after his release, the court ordered he is to have no contact with UF, Santa Fe College or any of his victims.
After his release, Garg will be handed over 
to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforce-ment, which could decide to deport him re-gardless of his intentions to leave the country on his own.

 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) 
— NASA has cleared space shuttle 
Discovery for liftoff Tuesday, and 
the weather looks promising as 
long as thunderstorms stay away 
during fueling.
After meeting Sunday afternoon, 
managers decided Discovery is in 
good shape to fly to the international space station. A power controller is-sue — one had to be replaced a week ago in the shuttle — did not stand in the way of the launch.
The chairman of the mission 
management team, Mike Moses, said there is no way of knowing with cer-tainty whether the new power con-
troller in Discovery might break like 
the old one did. To minimize the risk of a power failure, some equipment will be left on longer than usual — rather than shutting it down and then turning it back on, he said.
Two other power controllers failed in the lab at Johnson Space Center earlier this summer, adding to NASA’s concern. Engineers are comfortable with the workaround for Discovery, Moses said.
Forecasters, meanwhile, said 
there is an 80 percent chance the weather will cooperate for Discov-ery’s 1:36 a.m. liftoff. That’s better than previous forecasts.
But there is a 40 percent chance 
that thunderstorms could interfere with the afternoon’s fueling today. A fueling delay of more than three hours would bump the flight into the next day.
“Obviously, the weather is going 
to be one of our challenges,” Moses told reporters.
Discovery and seven astronauts 
will deliver about 17,000 pounds of space station supplies and equip-ment. Three spacewalks are planned during the 13-day flight.STATENASA clears Discovery

 The new parking garage on Gale Lemerand Drive on Saturday night. ON CAMPUSParking garage opens today, adds 927 new spaces
 Editor’s note: this article origi-
nally appeared in the June 2edition of the Alligator.

 Alligator Contributing Writer 
  
 UF’s new $15.5 million park-
ing complex opens its gates today 
to UF students, faculty and staff.
While the 927-space garage 
is available to all commuting 
Gators, it should mostly relieve parking for those who use the 
Health Science Center, the Col-
lege of Veterinary Medicine and the Ofﬁ  ce of Information Tech-nology, which are all nearby.
“I’m not sure if the parking 
problem will ever be relieved,” said Scott Fox, director of Trans-portation and Parking Services. “But with the opening of the new 
garage, a lot of spaces will be 
added.” 
The Southwest Parking Ga-
rage Complex, located on the cor-
ner of Gale Lemerand Drive and 
Mowry Road, has six stories and contains the widest parking spots on campus.
Its construction was intended 
to bring the number of decals issued closer to the number of spaces available.
Because there are only 24,000 spaces, only about two-thirds of the 36,000 drivers who are issued 
decals can park on campus at any 
given time.
Of these spaces, 19,821 are ac-
cessible to students, faulty and staff, while the remainder is re-served for visitor, delivery, ser-vice and emergency vehicles.
“We will always have a sup-
ply and demand challenge,” Fox said. “But the garage will certain-ly help.”
The Southwest Parking Garage Complex  includes green, orange, blue, carpool and gated zones.
The complex serves as the 
new home of UF’s Transportation and Parking Services, with 9,000 square feet of ofﬁ  ce space.
Along with the increase in parking spaces, there’s a 10 per-cent hike in decal costs.
According to UF’s Transpor-
tation and Parking Services Web site, a semester student commut-er decal currently costs $67. An annual decal is $134.
UF Transportation and Park-
ing Services does not receive funding from the university or 
state and relies solely on decal 
sales.
Because the university does 
not restrict the number of decals sold, fall’s proﬁ  t will likely cover 
the total price tag of the project.
“We are not in the business of 
turning a proﬁ  t,” Fox said. “We 
are in the business of breaking 
even.”
The parking complex called for 
a 12-month construction phase, 
including six months in design.
“The project has been nothing 
but successful,” he said. “It is a true win-win situation, especially for students.” “I’m not sure if the park-
ing problem will ever be 
relieved.”

UF's performance slipped in financial resourcesUF is laying off 60 employees, 46 as a direct result of bud-
get cuts and 14 as part of the reorganization of WUFT-FM.
UF announced in May that 58 employees would be laid 
off as a result of cuts, but that number was reduced by 12 
as colleges and other units reworked their plans. The extra 
layoffs in the College of Journalism and Communications 
— four faculty and 10 staff — were add-
ed when the college decided to revamp WUFT-FM, opting to offer more news programming instead of classical music.
The layoff numbers have changed 
and could continue to change as UF finds private funding to save some positions, 
employees find other jobs at UF and oth-
ers decide to retire before they are laid 
off, said Paula Fussell, UF’s interim vice 
president of Human Resource Services.
UF sent out official notices for most staff and some facul-
ty Wednesday, though they already knew they were being laid off, Fussell said. UF’s contracts call for a notice period between the notification of the layoff and the employee’s last day of work. The notice period can be up to a year. UF’s 2008-2009 budget plan called for 14 faculty and 118 staff lay-
offs. Eight faculty and 66 staff were laid off. Three faculty 
were later reinstated, and two were laid off in their place.

� POLICE: REALITY SHOW 
CONTESTANT FOUND   
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
VANCOUVER, British Colum-
bia (AP) — A reality show contes-
tant wanted for murder in the grue-some death and mutilation of his ex-wife was found dead Sunday 
of an apparent suicide after hang-
ing himself in a secluded Canadian motel, authorities said.
Sgt. Duncan Pound of the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police border integrity unit says police respond-ed to a call about a dead person in Hope, east of Vancouver, and then called investigators who were part 
of the massive manhunt for Jen-
kins.
The real estate developer and 
investor was wanted in California on first-degree murder charges after the mutilated body of his ex-wife Jasmine Fiore was found in a trash bin in Buena Park, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of 
Los Angeles.
Jenkins apparently hanged him-
self, said Farrah Emami, spokes-
woman for the Orange County Dis-trict Attorney’s Office in California, which is contact with Canadian police.
The Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police are “now able to confirm that 
a deceased person that was found 
in a motel in Hope, British Colum-bia is, in fact, Ryan Jenkins,” Pound said.Wanted 
man dead
self, is certainly beneficial to UF campus 
life.”
Campaign volunteers can be found 
around various parts of UF, beneath ban-
ners and in orange T-shirts with an Ask Me logo.
“The primary targets are new students 
to campus, which include freshmen, trans-fer students and new graduate students,” 
said Sharon Blansett, assistant director of 
housing for research and or-ganizational development at 
UF. 
Not much has changed 
since last year’s program, Blansett said.
Sunday, staff and student leaders drove 
around campus distributing bottled water 
and meeting and greeting parents and stu-dents. 
Bottled water, campus maps and RTS 
bus schedules will be distributed to stu-dents as part of the Ask Me campaign to-
day and Tuesday, she said.
The campaign is part of the One Team 
initiative — a project bringing together 
staff from across campus to provide fo-
cused and engaged customer service to all

OnCampu sReport, said UF’s rise in rank 
was a very slight increase be-cause the data were compared 
to information from more than 
250 schools.Regardless of the rankings, 
Orlando said, UF’s goal con-tinues to be to provide the best education possible.
“Rather than keeping our 
eyes on the scoreboard, we need to just play ball and keep moving down the field,” he said. 
But according to Orlando, 
parents and students still pay attention to the rankings.
Kate Shoulders, a Ph.D.

An Asian small-clawed otter pup reaches through its enclosure to touch the hand of otter trainer Emi Wil-
lows at the Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo on July 20. The pup is one of two born April 30 at the zoo.

In a small den on the west side of 
the Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo, 
there are four Asian small-clawed otters, two more than before.
First-time parents Jay and Lak-
ena welcomed two otter pups to the zoo on April 30, but the pups did not come out of their den until recently, said Jonathan Miot, assistant direc-
tor of the Teaching Zoo.
The zoo waited until the otter 
parents brought their pups out from 
the den to publicize their arrival.
In the wild, Asian small-clawed 
otters keep their young in a den un-
til they are able to open their eyes, 
which can take six to eight weeks. 
Miot said the Teaching Zoo wanted to do the same for Jay and 
Lakena.
Since being out of the den, the 
parents have been teaching the pups 
how to swim by dunking them in a small pool in their cage.
Miot said the pups did not ap-
preciate the dunking at first but are 
now getting used to the water.
The pups have not been named 
because their gender isn’t deter-
mined yet, said Emi Willows, a SFC 
student who works at the zoo. 
Miot said the zoo is very pleased 
with the way the parents have been raising the pups and do not want to 
interfere to check their sex.
The best time to see the animals 
is around 9 a.m. when the zoo opens 
or when it is cloudy outside. They 
like cooler weather, Miot said.

Florida officials buckle down on seat belt regulations

Alligator Writer
Not wearing a seat belt has become more 
dangerous to motorists — or at least to their 
wallets.
Police in the state of Florida can now pull over drivers solely for not wearing their seat belts, as the infraction has been bumped up to a primary offense, which carries a $104 fine. 
Previously a person could only get a ticket 
for not wearing a seat belt if he or she were 
already pulled over for another traffic viola-
tion. Now not wearing a seat belt is treated as a primary offense, and a driver can also get ticketed if the front-seat passenger is without a seat belt. 
“Now officers can take action then and there instead of having to pull them over for speeding or some other traffic violation first,” said Lt. Tim Frith, Florida Highway Patrol 
spokesman. 
“The whole intent of going 
from second to primary [offense] is to save lives,” Frith said. 
The law will increase the number of seat 
belt wearers, which will in turn increase the number of crash survivors, he said.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the law will save 124 lives, prevent 1,733 serious injuries and save $408 million in associated costs each year.
Frith said death rates are higher in fatal 
traffic accidents for people between 16 and 24 
years old.
“We could impact that age group just by 
changing the behavior of motorists, so they 
know they have to buckle their seat belt,” Frith said. “[This law] will make it turn into second nature.”

Six university police cars sat outside 
Marston Science Library and at least six 
officers searched the area for a suspected criminal June 1.
The crime: book theft.
Maria Hicks, a food and resource 
economics undergraduate, left her table 
on the fourth floor to answer her cell phone. 
When she returned, a man at her ta-
ble was zipping his backpack up, but she thought nothing of it, she said.
Then she noticed her $200 “Data 
Analysis” book was missing.
She searched for the man with the backpack, who she described as wearing an orange UF Gators shirt.
“I tried to chase him,” she said. “He 
disappeared so fast.”
UPD responded by searching the 
area for people matching the thief’s de-scription. Officers searched the bags of 
several people and questioned them 
about the crime.
Hicks had borrowed the textbook 
from a friend and will have to pay her back, she said.
Pam Bonner, a UPD spokeswoman, 
offered a moral to the story.
“Don’t leave your stuff, take it with 
you if you go somewhere,” she said.ON CAMPUSThief nabs pricey book

not stop Weeks from attacking the deputy.
Hanson returned to work May 27 after he 
was cleared by the ASO Office of Professional Standards, ASO spokesman Art Forgey said.
Forgey said the Gainesville Police Depart-
ment is conducting the criminal investigation. Its findings are not complete.
“Were glad it’s over with,” Forgey said. “There is no real winner. Now we have to pick up the pieces and move on.”
At around 1 p.m. on May 15, GPD re-
ceived calls about a man and woman fight-ing in a car at Northwest 34th Street and 39th Avenue. Before GPD officers arrived, Hanson 
pulled up and tried to stop the fight.
After being Tasered, Weeks 
tried to grab the deputy’s gun. 
Hanson shot Weeks several times, killing him, GPD spokesman Lt. Keith Kameg said. From about 9:30 a.m. to about 3 p.m., the jury listened to personal accounts of Hanson and the testimonies of multiple witnesses, said State Attorney Bill Cervone. 
Cervone said the grand jury concluded 
that Weeks’ death was a justifiable homicide.

Marla McGill had a lot of plans 
when she graduated from UF, 
but getting skin cancer wasn’t on her list.
The Jacksonville native said 
she loved the sunshine and went to the tanning salon only a hand-ful of times when she had free passes, but when a small mole on her stomach began to change col-ors last October, she knew some-thing was wrong.
A biopsy confirmed her fears 
— McGill was diagnosed with 
the early stages of skin cancer 
at age 23 — and the cancer was safely removed.
She is one of more than 25 mil-
lion Americans that tan in salons. On July 25, tanning beds were de-termined to be carcinogenic — the highest category of cancer risk.
According to the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, the risk of skin can-cer increases by 75 percent if the person uses a tanning bed before the age of 30. 
Based on older research, scien-
tists could only classify tanning beds as possibly harmful, but af-
ter analyzing about 20 different 
studies, researchers determined that tanning beds pose a far great-er risk than previously proven.
The research puts tanning 
beds and other sources of ultra-violet radiation in the same le-
thal group as tobacco, chimney 
sweeping and the hepatitis B vi-rus. International cancer experts also recently deemed tanning beds to be as dangerous as arse-nic gas, according to an article on MSNBC.com.
As of Aug. 17, nearly 34 per-
cent of the 1,909 people who re-
sponded to an MSNBC.com poll 
indicated that they had never used a tanning bed, and com-menters called them “cancer beds” that “should be illegal.”
But as the use of tanning beds 
has increased among people un-der the age of 30, doctors have 
also seen a rise 
in the number 
of young people with skin cancer, 
according to the article.
“The question is how students 
will react to this study, or even if they will react,” said Mel Toran, executive director for North Cen-tral Florida’s American Cancer 
Society. “Our hope is that people 
will finally recognize the danger that tanning beds present and take caution.”
Toran insists there are no ad-
vantages to tanning beds, espe-cially given the new research.
“The bottom line is simple,” 
he said. “If the risk is skin cancer, there is no benefit.” 
More than one million cases 
of skin cancer, the most common type of cancer, are diagnosed in the United States each year, ac-cording to the American Cancer Society Web site, and the num-ber of melanoma cases has risen steadily in the last few years. 
Taylor Tribou, a UF political 
science junior, said the free tan-ning offered by many companies and apartment complexes makes it convenient for young people.
Tribou lived at Royal Village 
Apartments, which offers a free tanning salon to residents.
She said that her decision to 
live at Royal Village wasn’t based on the free tanning, but it was a pleasant perk.
“I have fair skin, so I would 
have had to pay for a tanning membership somewhere else anyway,” she said. 
“I saved money by signing my 
lease there,” she said. “I think it 
was a smart idea on their part to 
attract more residents.”
Tribou estimated that she used 
the tanning bed at her apartment about 30 times during the year and said she plans to continue moderate use.
“I don’t go every day, so I’m 
not a tan-a-holic or anything,” 
she said. “I just feel more con-
fident when I’m tan. I don’t see what the big deal is.”
But McGill said her tanning 
bed days are over.
She said she regrets going to 
the tanning salon and not wear-ing enough sunscreen when she went outdoors. She wishes she had listened to her parents’ warn-ings to be safe while in the sun.
“The urge to always be tan is 
such a vanity thing,” she said. “If there’s one thing I learned from my experience, it’s that my health is more important than the color of my skin.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009

It turns out those Jimmy Choos can’t be 
considered an investment.
A UF study shows intelligent people have 
more economic success over a lifetime than 
those who are attractive or self-confident.
“If you were somehow able to choose from 
being smart, good-looking or self-confident, our study shows that while you’d want all three qualities, brains are the most important to economic success,” said Timothy Judge, the UF management professor who conducted the study along with graduate students Charlice Hurst and Lauren Simon.
“Smart people do better in their careers be-
cause they are more likely to be educated and are more confident in their abilities,” he said. 
Results of the study came from 191 men 
and women, ages 25 to 75, who participated in the National Midlife Development in the 
United States study.
“You could be the most beautiful teacher, 
but if you don’t have classroom management 
skills, then students aren’t going to care,” said Nadene Francis, assistant director of public re-lations for the UF Career Resource Center.
Intelligence standards for the study were 
based on mental exercises and tests, and self-confidence, which was the second-most im-
portant. Results were based on a 15-question survey about a person’s ability to handle situ-
ations.
Attractiveness was judged on personal 
photos on a scale from one to seven.   Although 
beauty placed last against intelligence and self-confidence, beauty’s importance in the job 
industry is still troubling, Judge said.
According to Judge, studies show that at-
tractive students tend to receive more instruc-
tion and attention from teachers and are pun-ished less frequently, increasing their chances of finishing high school and college.
“Beauty is key because society is based on 
looks,” said The Swamp Restaurant manager Erika Equizi of the food industry. “Pretty girls get more [tips].”
The results of the study, which were pub-
lished in the Journal of Applied Psychology, 
emphasize the need for employers to be fair 
when hiring, Judge said.
However, some employers feel neither 
intelligence nor physical attraction matter as much as personality and job skill.
“[Beauty’s] not going to do you any good,” 
said Lynne Vaughan, Reitz Union store direc-tor, of working in retail. “[Intelligence] won’t do you any good either if you don’t have the 
personality.”RESEARCHUF study: Brains superior to looks, self-confidence

Dana Carvey, of “Wayne’s 
World” fame, will perform at the 
Oct. 16 Gator Growl, organizers an-nounced on July 6.
Carvey was the second most popular comedian in the student 
poll conducted by Gator Growl staff 
earlier this year, said show spokes-man Bryan Griffin. Jimmy Fallon got the most votes.
Other comedians on the ballot 
were Darrell Hammond and Dem-etri Martin. The poll received about 500 responses.
Griffin said the staff wanted 
Fallon, but his schedule didn’t allow for an October performance.
Matt Sloan, the show’s producer, 
said staff aimed for a bigger name.
He said with the football team’s success and an exceptional senior 
class, the staff felt Carvey was worth 
the extra money.
“We wanted to up our game be-
cause they upped their game,” he 
said, adding that he wasn’t able to release Carvey’s payment for the show because it 
hasn’t been finalized yet.
He said in recent years the show 
has alienated students.
“I feel like we’ve really lost a lot 
of traction with the students, and we’re trying to get that back.”But it’s tricky picking acts, he 
said, because of the wide variety of people who attend the show — about 40,000 students, 15,000 locals and 15,000 alumni and football fans in town for the game the next day.
Carvey, a former “Saturday 
Night Live” cast member, portrayed Garth in the “Wayne’s World” mov-ies. His recent HBO special is called 
“Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies.”
Some students surveyed on cam-
pus weren’t familiar with Carvey, 
but recent UF graduate Rob Castel-lucci was excited to hear the news.It’s a “massive improvement” 
over last year’s comedian, he said. 
“I think he’s really funny com-
pared to a lot of the crap they usu-ally bring in,” he said.
Gator Growl organizers declined 
to name the musical act.
The bands on the ballot includ-
ed Sugarland, ZZ Top, O.A.R. and Third Eye Blind.
Tickets can be purchased by UF 
students, faculty and staff for $15 at gatorzone.com.

The link between age and vision 
loss may be a thing of the past.
New UF research suggests that 
bone marrow stem cells can be pro-
grammed to repair damaged retinas 
in people with a type of vision loss 
called macular degeneration, which 
causes worsened vision with age.
According to Maria Grant, se-
nior researcher for the project, the 
researchers experimented on mice 
and injected adult bone marrow 
stem cells into the rodents’ circula-
tory systems after modifying them to act like retinal cells.
“It’s a unique way to program 
cells,” Grant said.  “UF’s the first to 
do it in this way.”
The new procedure will target 
diseases like macular degeneration, 
the damage to a critical area of the 
retina, and cardiovascular disor-ders, such as atherosclerosis and 
coronary artery disease.
Macular degeneration affects 
almost two million people in the United States, making it the most common cause of vision loss in the country. 
“Macular degeneration usu-
ally causes blindness,” Grant said. 
“[This research] will someday re-
store vision.”
Grant said she thinks the same 
effect could be created by injecting 
drugs into the cells instead of modi-
fying them in a culture.
The researchers found that they 
could activate the stem cells by 
mimicking the body’s natural sig-
naling channels with chemicals, 
using drug ma-nipulation rather 
than genetic manipulation, Grant 
explained.
Twenty-eight days after receiv-
ing the modified stem cells, the mice 
with damaged retinas showed no differences from the normal mice. This suggests the same thing would happen in humans because mice are 
used as a common model for human disease, Grant said.
Grant and UF have a pending 
patent on their research, which was 
developed over about four years, 
and they hope to start clinical trials 
for the procedure within the next year, Grant said.MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 17

If you’ve got any lost library books, now’s 
the time to find them.
After a new policy went into effect Aug. 17, 
students may have less time after the due date to return a book before UF charges them for 
the cost of a replacement.
Lost books used to be replaced when li-
brarians get around to buying the new books, library spokeswoman Barbara Hood said. So some lost books aren’t back on the shelf in a timely manner, which prompted the change. 
Under the new policy, the library will in-
stitute a fixed schedule for book replacement, and as soon as the new book is ordered, the one who checked out the book will be respon-sible for its cost, she said.The new policy states that 
21 days after the due date, the library will charge bor-rowers a $35 processing fee per item for general loans. The next day, the replace-
ment item will be ordered, 
and the borrower will be re-
sponsible for the cost of the 
new item, in addition to the $35 fee.
The other late fees will remain largely the 
same. For general loans, it will still cost 25 cents per day after the due date until the maximum overdue fine kicks in after 20 days. That fine, however, will now be $5 as opposed to $10.
From July 1, 2008 to May 13, the library re-
ported 728 lost books at the Smathers Librar-ies, which at the time didn’t include the Health Science Center or the law school libraries.
Those books had a combined cost of about 
$50,000, Hood said.
During the last school year, UF students, 
faculty and staff checked out almost 220,000 books, she said.ON CAMPUSUF students will now pay cost of lost books, $35 fee

Charges were not filed against Sergio Castro, 22, the 
UF student arrested May 26 for spray-painting a memo-
rial for a local resident outside of The Top restaurant in 
downtown Gainesville.
Prosecutors who reviewed the case chose not to file 
charges because it wasn’t a typical case of graffiti vandal-
ism and because the owners of The Top wanted the felony 
charge of criminal mischief dropped, said Spencer Mann, 
spokesman for the State Attorney’s office.
Castro was arrested after a Gainesville Po-
lice Department officer saw him spray-paint ing the words “RIP MUCH LOVE” in honor 
of Barry Bernard, a Gainesville resident who 
drowned in May near the Matanzas Inlet in St. Johns 
County.
Castro sprayed “RIP MUCH” before his arrest.
“This is someone who was distraught over the loss of 
a friend who wanted to put a memorial up,” Mann said. 
“Not to excuse it, but it helps us to better understand his motivation.”
Castro said he is relieved that the charges have been 
dropped and thanked the owners of The Top for their le-niency. 
Overall, he said, the situation has been a positive one. “The whole purpose behind me going out and doing 
this was to bring attention to the cause,” he said.

A turtle statue modeled after UF quarterback Tim Tebow sits at a street corner two blocks from Jack -
sonville Municipal Stadium in Jacksonville, Fla., where the annual UF-Georgia game is played.

Part football legend, part sea tur-
tle and a little bit of alligator, Tebow 
Turtle marks territory claimed by the Gators in last year’s UF-Georgia game.
The roughly 5-foot-tall, fiberglass 
statue stands outside the Veterans Memorial Arena, about two blocks from Jacksonville Municipal Stadium, where the Gators and Bulldogs fight out their heated rivalry each fall.
It features Tim Tebow’s signature 
“Phil 4:13” under its eyes, which he wore when the Gators rolled the Bull-
dogs 49-10 in 2008, and an alligator tail 
to represent UF’s mascot.
 “We really just wanted to celebrate 
Tim,” said Bonnie Upright, the coor-dinator for Turtle Trails, the organiza-tion that placed the statue.
However, Tebow Turtle won’t be 
around to greet Gators fans in Octo-ber.
“He will be gone before the Flori-
da-Georgia game, but if not, I would probably move him anyway,” Upright said, fearing vandalism.
The statue is one of 24 turtles placed 
around Jacksonville as part of Turtle 
Trails, a fundraiser for Jacksonville 
organization Child Guidance Center that provides mental health services to children and families.
In March 2008, individuals and 
companies could sponsor a turtle for $5,000. The cost paid for production and artist fees, she said.
This October, Turtle Trails will auc-
tion off the statues. All proceeds will go to the Child Guidance Center.
Several turtles did not receive spon-
sorships, Tebow Turtle among them.
But Upright decided to have one of 
the extra turtles designed like Tebow because she knew it would do well at 
auction, she said. 
Upright con-
tacted the Tebow family and made 
sure that they were OK with the statue before having it made.
Justin Rose, an artist from Macclen-
ny, Fla., was asked to design the turtle. He accepted without hesitation.
“I admire Tebow because of the 
kind of person that he is and the val-ues that he has,” Rose said.
To prepare for the project, Rose said  
he read several versions of Tebow’s biography and referenced pictures of 
the quarterback’s cleats, alligator tails 
and turtle faces.
He worked for 14 hours a day for 
the first eight days and finished after about a month. He estimated the proj-ect took about 200 hours.
“When it was gone, it was almost 
like trying to drop an addiction,” he said.Tebow Turtle auction to benefit charity for children

 With two BCS 
national football titles in 
three years, it’s unsurpris-
ing that Gainesville’s greatest 
sin is pride. But according to a research group, the sin 
means the college town exhibits diverse debaucheries.
Geographers from Kansas State University mapped 
the seven biblical sins county-by-county across the U.S., re-
vealing that Alachua is one of the most prideful counties in 
Florida.
Pride, the deadliest sin according to some, is mapped by 
combining the data from Envy, Wrath, Lust, Gluttony, Sloth 
and Greed, each of which is determined by a separate statistic, 
or group of statistics. Researchers split each sin into ﬁ  ve levels of 
intensity, and when mapped, the darkest is the most sinful, said 
Mitchel Stimers, co-author of the project.
In Alachua, Lust registered at the highest level of sinfulness, Envy, 
Wrath and Sloth reached the second highest, Greed placed in the mid-
dle level and Gluttony ﬁ  nished at the second lowest level.
Consistently high rates of sin pushed Alachua into the top 14 most 
prideful counties in Florida, even though it only ranked at the highest 
level in one of the six substantiating sins, Stimers said.
Jacob Larson, associate pastor at Vineyard Church of Gainesville, was 
surprised when he found out Alachua was high up on the scale of pride.
“I guess we have the Gator Nation here,” Larson said. “And we’re very 
proud to be Gators.”
However, it’s worth having the pride that develops a sense of individual-
ism and pushes people to give back to humanity, he said. 
“It’s giving credit where credit is due,” Larson said. 
The dangerous part is when pride starts to dehumanize, he said. 
“If you choose to love yourself more than anyone else you.... commit atroc-
ities to another person because you love yourself that much,” he said. “The 
self-love begins to kill you eventually.”
Envy was tied to the number of thefts per capita. 
Although the crime rate decreased in Alachua by 3.3 percent from 2007 to 
2008, larceny has seen a slight increase in the same period, according to Art Forgey, public information ofﬁ  cer for Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce.
Some of the crime statistics can be blamed on the worsened economy be-
cause people often become desperate under ﬁ  nancial stress, he said Alachua’s 
large student population might also explain some larceny cases, he said. 
The start of the school year shows a noticeable increase in robberies. Scoot-
ers, cars and other personal belongings are often stolen from students. 
“Many students tend to leave their cars and apartments unlocked,” he 
said. “For most of them it’s their ﬁ  rst time on their own.”
Wrath was plotted by the number of violent crimes per capita.
Cities tend to have higher crime rates. But demographics and popula-
tion size are very important when comparing data among counties, ac-
cording to Steve Maynard, 
Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce spokesman.“It’s  
a very tough question,” he 
said. “In compari-
son with huge counties like Broward our crime rate is probably relatively low.”
He doesn’t believe UF con-
tributes to the number of violent crimes. Common crimes, such as bike theft and underage alcohol consumption, are more preva-
lent among students, he said. 
The number of violent offens-
es in Alachua, which include 
rape, assault, threats and stalk-ing, increased by 6.2 percent between 2007 and 2008, accord-ing to the Uniform Crime Report Domestic Violence Data for Alachua County. Stalking and threats made a 
large part of the increase. 
For Lust, researchers used the number 
of sexually transmitted diseases per capita.  
One reason for Alachua’s high rate of STDs could be the younger population, according to George Gibbs, regional program manager for the Alachua County Health Department. 
The most common sexually transmitted diseases 
in Alachua are gonorrhea and Chlamydia, which are 
largely carried by people between 15 and 24 year old.
Gluttony was determined by fast food restaurants per 
capita. Alachua’s low score on the Gluttony scale could be be-
cause Gainesville is one of the 25 most educated cities in U.S., according to Roland Loog, director of Visit Gainesville, which provides visitor information. Knowledge generally leads to higher income, and Loog believes educated populations shop for healthier food, he said.
Greed was measured by comparing the ratio between average income 
per capita and the number of individuals below poverty line. A higher 
ratio meant there is greater separation between social classes. 
Stimers has received some criticism over his team’s choice of sta-
tistics, particularly those tied to Gluttony and Sloth.
Originally, as shown in the maps, Sloth was determined by a com-
parison of money spent on arts, entertainment and recreation against 
unemployment rates.
Under pressure to have the presentation ready for a geographers’ 
conference in mid-March, the research team had to choose data that not only represented the sin but also was available for analysis, 
Stimers said.
“You can think of an idea theoretically, but then you have 
to get the scientiﬁ  c data for it,” he said. “It’s art as much 
as science.”
Stimers said the data is in the process of re-
evaluation with a focus on Gluttony and Sloth 
because their distributions didn’t show a 
clear pattern on the maps. Gluttony will 
be re-plotted with child obesity rates 
and Sloth will be updated with 
more detailed information on 
expenditures from the U.S.

Most of Shands at UF’s incu-
bators are occupied by newborns, 
but thanks to an $8.2 million 
grant, UF is building a different kind of incubator.
The grant for the Florida In-
novation Hub, a business center 
for startup companies, was an-
nounced July 24 along with plans for building the 45,000-square-foot facility, according to a UF 
press release. 
Scheduled for completion in 
December 2011, the building will 
provide office space, laboratories and conference rooms for several 
budding technological businesses 
and companies connected to the UF community.
Ed Poppell, UF’s vice president 
of business affairs, said that as soon as the planning is finished, workers will begin construction on the facility, hopefully within the next six months. 
The building will be construct-
ed on what is now a parking lot on the northeast corner of Shands 
at AGH site, Poppell said.
The facility will also house UF’s Office of Technology Licens-
ing and UF Tech Connect, whose job is to find technology from re-search that is patentable and then 
promote the licensing of these 
technologies to the market.
Win Phillips, UF’s vice presi-
dent for research, said that UF 
developed the idea of a new incu-
bator after seeing the success of a similar hub in Alachua County, which opened in 1995.
He said that various business 
sectors will use the facility, in-
cluding chemistry, agricultural 
and engineering fields.
Phillips said the hub will pro-
vide constant communication 
between people who license tech-
nology and the ability to share re-sources with other companies in the building to save money.
“There is no question that a 
company’s ability to succeed is 
far greater in an incubator,” he 
said.
The federal Economic Devel-
opment Administration awarded 
the grant, which is one of the 
largest of its kind ever awarded by the EDA’s Atlanta regional office, said EDA regional repre-sentative Philip T. Trader in the press release.
UF will contribute an addi-
tional $5 million in support of the 
project and will obtain this mon-
ey mainly through past royalty incomes, such as from faculty re-search, Phillips said.
“We expect it to be extremely 
successful,” he said. 
Katie Haney, a health educa-
tion and behavior senior, agrees with Phillips and said she thinks 
the hub is going to continue to 
improve the UF business com-munity. 
She is also optimistic about the 
new jobs that these future com-
panies will create for Gainesville 
residents, she said.
“As a soon-to-be graduate, 
I think it’s a great idea,” Haney 
said. “It’s something that is going 
to make Gainesville an even bet-ter place to live.”MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 21

UF’s yearlong reign as the top 
party school in the nation ended 
abruptly at noon on July 27, when it was announced that Penn State University had taken the infamous 
title.
UF slipped to No. 2 on the list, 
published each year by the Princ-
eton Review in its college guide, “The Best 371 Colleges.”
The ranking means UF has high 
levels of drug and alcohol use, a popular Greek system and students who don’t spend much time study-
ing, according to survey results from 
122,000 students at 371 colleges.
If UF had retained its No. 1 po-
sition, it would have been the first school to do so since 1995, when the University of Rhode Island com-pleted a three-year run in the top spot, according to Robert Franek, the author of the college guide.
Steve Orlando, UF’s spokesman, 
said he was relieved UF had been dethroned.
“People who do what I do at uni-
versities dread this announcement coming out,” he said.
One reason UF may have slipped 
to the second spot this year is that students weren’t treated to as many championships, he said.
When the last rankings came 
out, UF had just won three national championships — two in men’s bas-ketball and one in football.
“We figure people had a lot to 
celebrate,” Orlando said. 
It’s also possible UF President 
Bernie Machen’s attempts to curb alcohol consumption have had an effect on UF’s reputation, but it’s hard to tell, Orlando said.
“This is anything but a scientific 
survey,” he said.
Machen, who is in Indonesia 
meeting with university leaders, 
could not be reached for comment.
In addition to three other No. 2 finishes, UF placed first in one of 
the survey’s 62 categories: Best Ca-reer Services. The ranking means students rated UF’s job placement services highly.
UF was ranked No. 13 in Best 
Career Services last year, the first year the ranking was used.
Wayne Wallace, director of UF’s 
Career Resource Center, said he thinks his staff and the center’s use of student surveys have a lot to do with the level of satisfaction.
“I think that being responsive to 
student interests and needs has re-ally been the key,” he said. 
And, he said, 99 of the 100 com-
panies Fortune Magazine listed as 
the best ones to work for this year 
conduct recruitment at UF.
UF’s other No. 2 finishes were in 
the categories Best Athletic Facili-ties, Students Pack the Stands and Jock Schools, which measured pop-ularity of sports and fraternities. 
Last year, UF finished first in 
Students Pack the Stadiums and 
Students Study the Least.
This year, UF dropped to eighth among schools that study the least.
Students had mixed feelings 
about UF’s drop in the ranking.
Nicole Frankel, a music and pre-
health sophomore, said she was 
glad UF was no longer No. 1.
“I think [being No. 1] has kind 
of a negative connotation,” Frankel said. “The university is taken a little 
less seriously.” 
But freshman Alex Patel said she 
didn’t believe Penn State was a big-
ger party school than UF.
“I don’t think it’s true. I get texts 
about parties every night,” Patel said. “They must be partying a lot, like severely,” she said.
Jake Marika, a sociology sopho-
more, said he doesn’t think the ranking means much.
“Whoever says they party the 
most parties the most,” he said. “It’s bound to change every year.”
However, he said, the ranking 
might make Machen focus less on student drinking.
“Maybe it’s a good thing,” he 
said, “because Bernie will be less likely to get his panties in a bunch.”NATIONAL

stories originally published in the July 9, 14 and 16 editions of the Alligator.
STAFF REPORT 
 After plagiarizing passages from The 
New York Times in four of her news stories, 
a UF student was ﬁ  red July 7 from her in-
ternship at The Colorado Springs Gazette.
Rising junior Hailey Mac Arthur former-
ly wrote for The Independent Florida Alli-
gator and interned at The Gainesville Sun.
Journalism and Communications Dean 
John Wright said journalism students are repeatedly warned against plagiarism.
“For the life of me, I don’t see how this 
kind of thing could happen in this day and 
age,” he said. “Even if the person felt com-
pelled to do something so dishonest... I’m totally bafﬂ  ed.”
News of the ﬁ  ring reached blogs and The 
Associated Press stories by the evening of July 7. Some journalism professors received  e-mails about the incident July 8, prompting them to quickly and ﬁ  rmly announce the college’s stance against plagiarism in class-es and on Facebook, Twitter and blogs.
That afternoon, Wright’s Facebook status 
read, “One thing is certain. Plagiarism will not be tolerated at the College of Journalism and Communications.” 
Meredith Cochie, adjunct lecturer at the 
journalism college, discussed the issue in her class and posted it on the class blog so students could discuss it.
Wright said that all colleges ﬁ  ght student 
plagiarism on school work, but this is the ﬁ  rst time since Wright became dean a year and a half ago that a UF student has been exposed for something of this magnitude.
Professor and journalism department 
chair William McKeen said he takes plagia-rism as a “personal insult” and that plagia-rism by a student causes concern over the value of a degree from the college.
After discovering the plagiarized pas-
sages, The Colorado Springs Gazette issued a public apology on the paper’s Web site, with links to the plagiarized Times passag-
es. Links to Mac Arthur’s offending stories 
were removed from the site.Editor Jeff Thomas said the newsroom 
got a tip Tuesday morning that a passage in 
Mac Arthur’s story had been published in 
the Times only a week before.
“It does not take a lot of sleuthing on 
the part of anybody to follow up on a tip 
and ﬁ  nd out whether something has been 
borrowed from The New York Times,” he said.
Mac Arthur was unpaid, but she interned 
for college credit, he said. 
“I wouldn’t presume 
to tell the school how to resolve this one way or another,” he said. “I cer-
tainly have to believe that the university doesn’t tolerate plagiarism. Whether that same standard applies to an internship set-ting, I don’t know.”
One of the stories Mac Arthur plagia-
rized was a man’s ﬁ  rst-person account of the death of his daughter.
Overwhelmed with his daughter’s death, 
George Goens said he took eight months to 
write the story of why his grandson Luke 
and granddaughter Claire will grow up without a mother.
Goens said he would like to speak to Mac 
Arthur and understands the consequences she could face.
“I’m not interested in any kind of retri-
bution or punishment,” he said. “I just want 
the person to own up to the mistake they’ve 
made and make better decisions in the fu-ture.”
Having written two books on the educa-
tion system, Goens has his opinions on how students are taught to learn.
“I think our whole society has to take a 
look at how we rush kids and take shortcuts to get test scores,” he said. “A well-educat-
ed person has a sense of principle and eth-
ics, around which they make decisions so they can live a good life.”
Mac Arthur met with ofﬁ  cials from the 
College of Journalism and Communications July 15.
McKeen, along with journalism master 
lecturer Mike Foley, attended the meeting with Mac Arthur, but UF’s privacy laws 
mean the information about Mac Arthur’s 
future won’t be released.
“I really can’t say anything other than 
the matter is being resolved,” McKeen said. UF student ﬁ  red for plagiarism at Colo. internship

Drivers can expect traffic delays 
across central Gainesville to end no 
earlier than September 2011.
Road and sidewalk resurfacing 
that began in June on Northwest and Southwest 13th Street will start on Main Street on Sept. 1 and Uni-versity Avenue on Jan. 1.
According to the Florida De-
partment of Transportation spokes-woman Laurie Windham, Main Street will be permanently reduced 
from four lanes to two in the one-
mile stretch between North Eighth Avenue and North 23rd Avenue, in-creasing downtown public parking.
The construction will cost at least 
$13 million and will be funded by state taxes, requiring an estimated 8,640 hours of labor, she said. 
During resurfacing, asphalt on 
the roadway is replaced and dam-aged sidewalks are repaired, she said. While sidewalk repairs require minimal lane closures and can be completed during the day, road re-paving can cause major delays.
Nighttime paving for the 13th 
Street phase, which spans four miles 
from Southwest Ar-
cher Road to North-
west Sixth Avenue, began Aug. 1 and could continue for up 
to three months, according to an FDOT press release.
While 13th Street and University 
Avenue will each take six months to complete, the Main Street renewal is 
a two-year project, Windham said.
Windham said despite weather 
delays, work on 13th Street is still 
expected to end in December.
State standards call for routine 
road resurfacing, said Regina Hawk-ins, a public education specialist for the city of Gainesville. 
New criteria call for the instal-
lation of detector devices on curbs for the visually impaired and wider ramps for those in wheelchairs. Bi-cycle lanes will be added to all three roads.
“It has been on the drawing board 
for a long time,” Windham said. “It was definitely [the roads’] turn.”
Businesses with driveways lead-
ing onto 13th Street said they have not been affected by the road work.
“I can’t really say that we have 
been hurt at all by it,” said Ryan Levine, guest service manager of the Holiday Inn University Center.
The pockets of those caught 
speeding in the areas, however, will be take a hit — state law allows for 
a 200 percent fine increase in active 
construction zones.
V.E. Whitehurst & Sons Inc., of 
Williston, was contracted for the 13th Street resurfacing for $3.9 mil-lion.
The other two projects are still 
being bid on by independent con-tractors, Windham said.Delays to

UF students are no longer able to pay for classes and other 
university expenses with cash or debit cards or make over-the-
counter payments to the University Cashier at Criser Hall. The change was enacted on June 12.
However, the change won’t affect most students, as about 
73 percent of payments are handled electronically, UF spokes-man Steve Orlando wrote in an e-mail.
UF expects to save $85,000 a year by eliminating the over-
the-counter option, Orlando said.
Other payment options, like online credit card transactions 
and e-checks, will remain available.
Payments can also be made by dropping 
checks in a 24-hour drop box outside the Univer-sity Cashier’s office or by mailing checks to UF.
The most popular payment method is the online e-check, 
which is free, he said.
UF will still charge a fee for online credit card transactions, 
and Visa cards will still not be accepted because the company charges a flat rate for transactions, as opposed to a percentage, he said.
UF prefers to pay a percentage fee because of the wide vari-
ety in payment sizes, Orlando said. 
Most of the remaining 27 percent of students who pay 
through the University Cashier pay with checks.
University departments that send their deposits to the ca-
shier will not be affected by the new policy, according to a memo sent to administrators on June 9.UF cashier stops

After a marked absence from a May meeting to 
address the closure of Shands at AGH, Shands CEO 
Timothy Goldfarb announced a number of effects 
of the closing on Shands at UF at a public meeting 
July 15. 
Goldfarb, who oversaw the closing, said Shands 
at UF will be equipped to take on extra patients 
when it opens a new emergency department and 
Shands Cancer Center on Nov. 1.
Goldfarb said none of programs or employees 
from Shands AGH would be cut by the closure, adding that only 52 of the 1150 AGH employees 
have not yet been placed. 
Still, Goldfarb was unsure what presence AGH’s 
programs for heart rehabilitation and wound-care 
would have at Shands at UF, but parts of the pro-
gram would likely appear, he said. 
Starting Nov. 1, Shands will offer 92 more pa-
tient beds than they have currently, though a less-
ened obstetric capacity may mean delivering moth-ers will be two to a room. 
“It will fit. It doesn’t mean it will be comfort-
able,” Goldfarb said. 
North Florida Regional Medical Center mean-
while is also prepared for more patients, while the 
Alachua County Public Health Department plans to 
extend its hours and services. 
Jean Munden, Alachua County Health Depart-
ment administrator, said increasing the depart-ment’s operations would depend on whether or not 
it receives the $750,000 from low-income pool state funding, for which it has qualified and expects to 
receive next week. 
The department expects to take on many of the 
low-income patients without health care, who can 
no longer depend on Shands at AGH. 
Shands at UF has also taken steps to provide for 
patients without health insurance by partnering 
with Solantic to open an urgent care center, Gold-farb said.
The center is scheduled to open in September.Still, some doubted Shands at UF’s ability to 
treat veterans and those lacking heath care. 
“Solantic is not a cheap, afford-
able option to health care,” said one Gainesville resident at the meeting, a veteran, who stressed 
the need for a plan that serves the 
majority of the community.  
Others said the cultural transi-
tion would be huge for AGH patients.
“We already know that services to the low-in-
come are very poor,” said Commissioner Jack Don-
ovan, who spoke of a “population left behind.” 
Goldfarb said tough economic times and finan-
cial losses made closing AGH the best solution, estimating the shut down would save about $79.2 
million during the next seven years. 
“As a last resort when we looked at those storm 
clouds, we said, you know, we have to close AGH,” 
he said. “The decision, obviously, was a difficult 
one.”
Vice President of University Relations Jane Ad-
ams said after the institution is dismantled, UF 
plans to convert the property into a tech-transfer development complex, a facility used to bring UF’s 
research to the marketplace.LOCALShands CEO discusses closure

James Chamberlain decided to 
protest the 130-meal limit at St. Francis House when he heard the story of a pregnant woman who was turned away from a meal. She was the 131st person of the day, he said.
“Based on moral, ethical stan-
dards alone, if she’s pregnant and hungry, let her eat,” said Cham-berlain, from Catholic Action Re-source Exchange, the organization 
that put the march together.
About 30 to 50 people marched 
from St. Francis House and ended 
at the steps of City Hall, where protesters spoke out against the limits July 28.
The 130-meal limit is enforced 
by the city because St. Francis House set a 130 limit when they initially applied to obtain a spe-cial-use permit allowing them to serve more than 20 meals a day, said Bob Woods, Gainesville spokesman.  
Religious organizations such 
as St. Francis House can serve no more than 20 meals without a spe-cial-use permit.
County Commissioner Rodney 
Long has spoken against the re-striction, and Mayor Pegeen Han-rahan has advocated a temporary lifting of the limits, Chamberlain said.
Long and Hanrahan did not 
return phone calls in time for pub-lication.
Kent Vant, executive direc-
tor of St. Francis House, said the 
special-use permit is renewed every five years by the city planning board.
When renewing the permit ear-
lier this year, Vant asked about removing the limit or increasing 
the limit. 
The planning board told him 
that only City Commission has the 
authority to change the permit’s limit, he said. 
The city planning board can 
only renew it.
Chamberlain is confident that 
his cause will succeed.
“It’s not a matter of if it’s lift-
ed,” he said.
“It’s a matter of when, and we 
believe that with our collective 
voice it will be sooner rather than 
later.”26, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009

 The College of Engineering announced a new 
dean on July 6 — the ﬁ  rst female dean in the college’s 
history.
And it’s just in time as the 2009-2010 academic 
year marks the college’s 100-year anniversary.
Cammy Abernathy, who has been at UF since 
1993, took over on July 17, replacing Pramod Khar-gonekar, who just ﬁ  nished his eighth year as dean.
Khargonekar announced his resignation in late 
2007. However, due to budget uncertainties, the 
search process was cut short in 
March of 2008 and resumed in Jan-
uary.
“It’s not really about me,” Ab-
ernathy said of her selection as 
the ﬁ  rst female dean in a UF news release. “It’s a sign of where engi-
neering has to go in the future.”
“We have to change the way 
engineering is perceived, and we 
have to change the way it is introduced to potential students. This is especially important because engi-neering – and educating the next generation of engi-
neers – is so critical to our country today.”
Abernathy attended Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology as an undergraduate and earned her 
master’s and doctorate degrees at Stanford Univer-
sity.
She has also worked for AT&T Bell Laboratories, 
according to a memo sent to administrators on July 
6.
She is currently the associate dean for the Ofﬁ  ce 
of Academic Affairs and a professor of materials sci-
ence in the engineering college.
Her husband, Steve Pearton, is a UF distinguished 
professor of materials science and engineering.
Abernathy could not be reached for salary infor-
mation, but Khargonekar’s salary is listed as about $302,000. Abernathy currently earns about $233,000, 
according to UF’s Web site.
Khargonekar said he plans to continue teaching 
and researching in the electrical and computer engi-neering department after he resigns. 28, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009

Tow truck drivers in Midtown now 
have the option to boot or tow illegally 
parked cars.
 Changes in the towing policy at the 
UF Plaza, 1702 W University Ave., have 
frustrated some merchants in the area, but others said that booting is better for driv-ers.
Parking Solutions, the company that 
patrols the lot, began booting in April.
Kevin Witesides, owner of Parking 
Solutions, said booting is less expensive than towing but still acts as deterrent. The booting ﬁ  ne is $60 versus the $76 towing ﬁ  ne.
Booting also reduces the chances of 
damaging the vehicle, a problem that can happen while towing, Witesides said.
Drivers with towed cars can receive up 
to $300 in ﬁ  nes. Beyond the initial charge, a towing bill can include a storage fee, lean fee and administration fees and taxes. 
Booting incurs no extra fees, he said. 
 “Nine out of 10 
people would rather 
be booted than towed,” he said. “In the beginning no one wants either, but when 
they think about not having to get a ride to 
the towing company to get their car, and it saves them time and money, they always agree booting is the better option.” 
Mike Cook, manager of I Love N.Y. 
Pizza, feels that booting will do a better job of getting the message across, he said. However, some employees in the area 
see downsides to the policy.
Geyzer Salgado, manager of Fritanga 
Latin Grill, opposes booting. Parking So-lutions takes business away when booted 
cars are left in the lot, he said.
The company doesn’t notify people 
when they are illegally parked. The car 
can sit there for two to four hours and pos-sibly turn away customers, Salgado said. 
Filup Molina, manager of How I Got 
An A, thinks people don’t know where to park when visiting Midtown businesses.
“It’s a bad way to treat customers who 
do want to come to our business,” he said.
Ultimately, Witesides feels that he is 
doing college students a favor, he said.
“If you can get away with a cheaper 
deterrent then why not help the kids out a little bit,” Witesides said. Booting begins in Midtown bar area

Growing up in Tampa, Ph.D. candidate 
Ashley Boggs enjoyed Florida’s wildlife and 
often played with lizards and turtles. 
However, graduating to alligators didn’t 
cross her mind until later, she said.
“I never thought about the bigger animals 
like alligators,” Boggs said. “Other than ca-noeing down the Hillsborough River as a kid, I never really ran into them.”
Boggs now studies alligator growth at the 
Guillette Lab at UF to assess the effect of toxins on the animals in the wild.
As an undergraduate zoology student, 
Boggs volunteered in the lab where she was 
paired with a graduate mentor, a position she 
now holds. 
The eggs used in her study were collected 
from Lake Woodruff, a relatively clean site, Lake Apopka, which is considered a contami-nated area, and their test site, near Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. 
“Everything that the embryo needs to de-
velop is packed into the egg by the mother,” 
Boggs said. “We wanted to see if the mother 
was putting anything into the egg that might be harmful.”
Boggs is curious to see what effects the 
space center may have on the alligators.
“[Cape Canaveral] is still fairly wild, and 
there’s a decent sized alligator population out there. We’ve been looking at chemicals like flame retardants, heavy metals and perchlo-
rate, which makes up a large part of rocket 
fuel,” Boggs said. 
Boggs said some of these chemicals can 
reduce the production of thyroid hormone, which alters metabolism and development.High levels of perchlorate have not been 
detected in the area. It has a very hot, intense burn, and most of it may burn up during 
launches, with little escaping into the environ-
ment when the shuttle takes off, Boggs said.
However, perchlorate may enter nearby 
waterways at other points on the space center.
“We’re very interested in the areas where 
they’re washing the shuttles down afterwards or maybe where they’re loading or unloading the fuel and there might be some sort of spill-age there,” Boggs said. 
Once the eggs were collected, Boggs’ job 
was to make sure that all of the eggs, and the alligators hatching from them, experienced the exact same conditions.
The more than 250 alligators being studied 
live in greenhouses on the rooftops of Bartram and Carr halls. All reptiles are packed in about six tubs, which resemble the natural crowding behavior of young alligators in the wild.
Boggs records each alligator’s length every 
two weeks, first measuring from snout to tail and again without the tail.
“This is more indicative of their actual 
length because tail size can vary,” Boggs said. 
Finally Boggs takes the weight and mea-
sures the tail girth; the size of the tail girth is generally an indication of health. 
“There is a wide difference in the growth 
rates of these animals. Whether or not it’s sig-nificant from lake to lake, we don’t know yet. But just visually we know that some animals aren’t doing as well as others,” Boggs said.
The alligators are almost 1 year old, and the 
largest are around two feet. The smallest are less than half that size.
To prevent bias in the study, Boggs is in-
tentionally unaware of the origins of any par-
ticular alligator. However, each alligator was 
fitted with an electronic chip so that data can be stored on a computer system. 
When the study is complete, she will look at 
the computer and be able to match the groups of alligators with their original home. 
Alligators were chosen as the subject of this 
study because they are a “sentinel species.”
“They can tell us things about the environ-
ment. They’re kind of like our watchdogs,” Boggs said.
Because alligators are aquatic, any toxins in 
the water will end up in them. Additionally, alligators eat a lot of fish, which increases their exposure to contaminants.
The irony of a UF Gator working with al-
ligators has not been lost on Boggs.
“It’s a joke that I have to deal with a lot,” 
she said. Two of the most important things that Boggs has learned while studying alliga-tors are confidence and respect.
“You can’t hesitate and be scared when 
you’re out there trying to catch an alligator,” she said.
On the other hand, they command respect.“You just have to understand that this is 
a powerful animal and even though you get used to handling them, they’re still wild,” Boggs said.
But Boggs sees her work extending beyond 
alligators.
“What we do to the environment, we’re 
doing to ourselves as well. There’s not a sepa-ration between the two; we are a part of our environment,” Boggs said.MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 29

There will no longer be a quiet oasis 
outside the University Galleries on the 
east side of UF’s campus.
After a 34-year stint, “Water Sculpture” 
has been removed due to vandalism, and the sounds of water trickling down the massive metal sculpture will be replaced with a planter.
“We’re all very sad it was vandalized to 
the extent that required us to remove it,” said Denise Krigbaum, UF College of Fine 
Arts Communications Coordinator. “I do 
feel the sculpture was a symbol of the col-lege and the university.”
The sculpture was removed after van-
dals damaged the piping inside the foun-
tain that allowed water to flow over the 
sculpture.
“It wasn’t the university’s fault for tak-
ing it down,” she said. “It was the person 
who vandalized it.”
Commissioned in 1975 and created by 
Jeoffrey Naylor, a former UF sculpture 
professor, the stainless steel structure ini-tially cost $20,000.
It was paid for by grants from art en-
dowments, UF student government and the University Budget Commission,  Krig-baum said.
Thirty-four years later, more than three times its expected lifespan, the Physical Plant Department was asked by the Col-lege of Fine Arts to remove the fountain.
“It was expensive to maintain because 
there were a lot of pranks done involv-ing the sculpture,” Krigbaum said. “ It’s understood that its lifetime is made to be limited.”
Over the years, UF fine arts students 
have been known to contribute to the sculpture by adding soap or Jello as a right of passage.
“I think that it has been well loved over 
the years,” she said. “Some of that love took its toll.”
Two main obstacles stood in the way of 
repairing the sculpture: cost and artistic 
integrity.
It would cost an estimated $40,000 to re-
pair the fountain, according to Krigbaum, 
a number which upset some students at UF.
“Dumping money into fixing the foun-
tain is not worth it,” said Ashley Neu-kamm, a senior fine arts major. “I’d rather have my faculty be there on call when I 
need them instead of pouring money into 
the maintenance for the fountain.”
The 24-foot-wide, 8-foot-tall sculpture 
is now in storage and will be recycled by the Physical Plant Department.
“Even if we could repair it, there are 
ethics involved when an artist creates a piece,” Krigbaum said.
“It has been damaged beyond repair 
and couldn’t meet the artist’s initial in-tent.”
As students walk by the empty plaza 
outside of the University Gallery, the sights and sounds of 13th Street are for-
ever changed.
“I feel like it’s something the art depart-
ment is known for,” Neukamm said.
“It’s like the equivalent of taking down 
the french fries or the potato in Turling-
ton.”30, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009

The fountain “Water Sculpture” near the University Galleries was removed over the

Perhaps men really are from 
Mars.
Male students at UF are becom-
ing increasingly alien as female 
enrollment grows.
Data show that the female stu-
dent population at UF has out-
numbered the male population over the past 10 years and has continued to rise. This fall, women will comprise 60 percent of incom-
ing freshmen.
The increasing number is not 
about innate ability, but rather 
women’s organizational abili-ties and tendency to reach goals, 
said Mary Ann Clark, an associate 
professor in the College of Educa-tion who researches male under-achievement in public education. “I don’t think colleges and uni-
versities seek to admit more fe-male students, but in general, the 
applicant pool of women is stron-
ger as a group,” Clark said. 
“They are showing higher 
GPAs, more advanced course 
work in high school and are in-
volved in more extracurricular and leadership activities than men as a group.” 
The increasing female popula-
tion is not restricted to UF. 
Female enrollment tops 60 per-
cent in five of Florida’s 11 state universities. Nationally, women 
comprise 57 percent of college 
enrollment, and this trend is pro-jected to increase through 2015, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics. 
In addition, flagship universi-
ties like University of North Car-olina at Chapel Hill “have been 60 percent female for quite a few 
years,” Clark said.In the past, people assumed 
men did not need help in school 
and would “land on their feet,” 
Clark said. Recent data show that, 
in big cities, women in their 20s earn more than men in the same age group. Admissions offices 
across the country are encourag-
ing more males to apply, she said.
The gender gap at the college 
level can affect marriage and fam-ily patterns as well as economic patterns, Clark said.“Numbers in enrollment mat-
ter,” said Milagros Pena, director of the Center for Women’s Studies 
and Gender Research.
Pena said that gender diversity 
enriches the college experience 
and helps students prepare for a 
globalized world. 
“I think this is significant and 
welcomed, and of course we want 
to encourage young men to seek higher education,” Pena said. 
“But we are also still challenged 
by inequities in pay and access to opportunities, even as educated women.” 
Pena said it is also important 
to see if the increase in numbers translates significantly for women in less traditional professions like engineering.
While the majority of UF’s col-
leges are dominated by women in terms of population, engineer-ing is one of two colleges where 
women are outnumbered, Clark said. The second is business ad-
ministration. 
Women are entering the engi-
neering field and taking advan-tage of UF’s status as the top-ranked engineering program in Florida, said Andrea Eckstrom, a 
senior majoring in mechanical en-
gineering. 
“I didn’t initially choose engi-
neering because there are fewer women involved in the field. It 
was just something I had always 
wanted to do,” Eckstrom said. 
However, Eckstrom said peo-
ple questioned her ability to suc-
ceed in engineering during high 
school and her freshman year of college.
“Not being taken seriously can 
be a huge motivator. I felt like 
I had something to prove,” she 
said. 
Despite more women in tech-
nical electives, Eckstrom said she 
notices the gender disparity. NATiONAlWomen outnumber men in Florida universities
“I don’t think colleges and 
universities seek to admit 
more female students, but 
in general, the applicant 
pool of women is stronger 
as a group.”

POLL QUESTION TEEING OFF WITH PHIL KEGLER� A SECOND HEISMAN OR THIRD BCS TITLE 
WOULD PUT THE SENIOR QB IN RARE AIR.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
Tim Tebow can’t go a day without seeing himself or his 
team mentioned on TV, but he’s not tuning in for the talk 
of Florida winning a third title in four years or his bid for a second Heisman Trophy and college football immortality.
Spare him the glowing tributes to his character, leader-
ship or athletic ability.
He’s not interested in any of that. He’ll only tune in to 
see the doubters.
“I usually don’t watch anything — just NFL stuff — but 
sometimes I’ll watch it as motivation if it’s sort of a nega-tive thing,” Tebow said. “I’m not a big reader of myself or watching it, but some things I will because I know it moti-vates me and it will irritate me.”
So go ahead and doubt Tebow. He’ll work that much 
harder to prove you wrong.
He showed he could run through defenders as a fresh-
man, throw over them as a sophomore and win the big games as a junior. There are only two things left for his se-nior season: displaying his NFL potential and leading the Gators to an undefeated season.
One of the Greats?
The only problem with Tebow’s motivational formula is 
that he isn’t leaving much room for criticism. 
In three years, Tebow has completed a school-record 65.8 
percent of his passes for 6,390 yards and 67 touchdowns. He’s the Southeastern Conference’s all-time leader in pass-ing efficiency (173.8) and has rushed for 2,037 yards and 43 touchdowns, also a UF record.
In all likelihood, he will break SEC career marks in yards 
gained, touchdowns and rushing touchdowns this season, and he’s a likely candidate for a second Heisman and third Maxwell Award.
Those numbers, combined with a 22-5 record as a starter, Doubters make Tebow motivated to outdo himself
It might be a year late, but we here at alligatorSports be-
lieve in change too.
So this fall, expect a lot of changes. Some will go well, 
some will not. Hopefully you love most of them and only hate a few of them. It will be a bit of an experiment, but we 
feel really good about some of the ideas we’ve come up 
with to improve one of the best college newspaper sports sections in the country.
After all, people claim the 2009 Florida football team 
could go down as one of the greatest in history.
We hold our coverage and reporting to similar stan-
dards.
Onto the changes!alligatorSports Fantasy Challenge: A big part of our 
overhaul has to do with getting you, the reader, more in-volved. After all, you’re the one that reads our stuff, wheth-er it be in print or online, so let’s make it a little more of a two-way conversation.
On that note, I’d like to introduce the Readers vs. Writ-
ers showdown in the realm of Fantasy College Football.The league will consist of ten teams 
— our five football beat writers (Bob-by Callovi, Mike DiFerdinando, Kyle Maistri, Mike McCall and myself) and five readers (I’m looking at you.)
How will we pick? A contest, of 
course.
If you think you have what it takes 
to take us down (bring the trash talk, we certainly will) — tell us why in 100 words or less. Send it to sports@
alligator.org by Friday at 5 p.m. We will publish the five winners’ entries, so you must keep it clean. Anything goes, but foul language gets you eliminated.
Things to keep in mind: You have to be able to make the online live draft, sched-
uled for Sept. 2 at 7:45 p.m.  The player pool will consist of the six BCS conferences only. We’re playing on CBSSports.com, so you will have to sign up there if we pick you as a contestant. Feel free to check out the complete rules while you’re there.
And why would you like to do this? Besides simply be-
ing able to claim you’re the best, we have a special treat in store if a reader wins the league championship.
Take home the title, and you get your very own 525-
word guest column, appearing in the Alligator’s sports sec-tion.
And if you’re not one of the lucky five we pick, you’ll 
still be able to enjoy the fun along the way. Coverage of the showdown will appear from time to time — whether it be online, in print or on our podcast.
Wait, you have a podcast?: Yes, indeed we do — alli-
gatorSports The Podcast has been going strong for a little more than six months after we reincarnated it from a ter-
rible former state. We record at least twice weekly in the 
fall and give you the scoop on everything UF athletics and touching on the rest of college sports and more. The de-bates are numerous and fiery to say the least, just the way we like it.
Publish the country’s best sports section and get you involved? Yes we can!

Quarterback Tim Tebow is on pace to leave UF as the SEC’s career recordholder in yards gained, rushing touchdowns and total touchdowns. He already holds the league’s all-time mark in passing efficiency despite his run-first reputation. By ANTHONY CHIANG 
 Alligator Writer 
  
 Sunday not only acted as a re-
minder of the beginning of a new 
volleyball season, it also marked 
the beginning of the end of senior libero Elyse Cusack’s career at Florida.
Cusack and the UF volleyball 
team played in the Orange and Blue Scrimmage on Sunday in the O’Connell Center as they do every year. This one, however, was spe-
cial for Cusack because it was the 
last one she would play in.
But as she enters her senior 
year, the pressure to succeed still does not supersede the excitement 
she feels.
“This is my last go-around and 
I just love playing here, there is no 
better place to be,” Cusack said. “It 
gets a little emotional, but I’m ex-
cited about the season.”
The pressure to meet expecta-
tions still exists for her, even in Sunday’s intrasquad scrimmage in 
which players switched from one 
team to another. 
The Orange team won the ﬁ  rst 
set 25-19 and the Blue team won the second set 28-26.
“There was a serve where Elyse 
didn’t pass perfectly, and I think 
I heard a gasp from the fans,” UF 
coach Mary Wise said. “She creat-ed those expectations for herself by 
how hard she plays each night.”After a summer of training, the 
players are eager to start the sea-
son, but Wise is grateful for the opportunity the scrimmage gives 
her.
“They are ready to play some-body else, there is no question and 
I think if the team had their choice, the season would start tomorrow night,” she said. “But I am glad we 
have ﬁ  ve more days to practice.”
As Florida begins its season on Friday against UNLV, the Gators 
are hoping their improved play near the net will help them over-come some of their weaknesses 
from last year.
Outside hitters Callie Rivers, Kristy Jaeckel and Colleen Ward 
showed signs of big improvement on Sunday as they combined for 19 kills.
“I think we can be very physical 
from left to right and we are going to be a big-time, quick and high-jumping team,” Wise said.
Although the entire starting 
lineup did not play together in the scrimmage, four of the probable starters — Cusack, Jaeckel, Kelly Murphy and Lauren Bledsoe — 
teamed up to win the ﬁ  rst set in  
convincing fashion.
But in the second set, players 
were switched around multiple 
times to observe how they would 
handle different positions.
Although the scrimmage will 
not count, Wise believes Sunday was a preview of things to come.
“The best thing about being able 
to do this is that it is like a dress re-hearsal,” she said. “There is noth-ing we can do in practice that has 
this kind of game like feel to it.” Orange and Blue Scrimmage signals ﬁ  rst last for Cusack42, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009

2009  Columnist Predictions
Sept. 19, Oct. 10, Oct. 31 and Nov. 28 are all dates that 
will be circled on the Gators’ schedule.
Those are the dates UF plays Tennessee, LSU, Georgia 
and FSU.
Though that quartet is the best competition the Gators will 
face, it is these games that are easiest to get hyped up for and 
UF will easily show its dominance over four teams that still 
have not returned to their former cham-pionship form.
But if those teams cannot stop the 
Gators, then who on the rest of their soft schedule will? 
The answer is nobody will.Charleston Southern, Troy and Flor-
ida International will give the Gators’ backups plenty of game experience. 
Kentucky, Vanderbilt and South 
Carolina will give the defending nation-al champions a little more of a challenge 
but none will be able to keep it close for the duration of a game.That leaves it up to two teams with plenty of question marks.
Arkansas’ chances depend on transfer quarterback Ryan 
Mallett, who alongside preseason All-SEC tailback Michael Smith could make the Razorbacks’ offense dangerous.
Then, there is Mississippi State. No one knows how Dan 
Mullen will fare in his ﬁ  rst season as a head coach. No one knows how the Bulldogs will handle his spread offense. Even with all the uncertainties, Mullen knows better than any other opposing coach what he can expect to see from the Gators, making the Bulldogs a dangerous road game for the Gators.
But unlike last year’s surprising loss to Ole Miss, there will 
be no need for Tim Tebow to give another heartfelt speech be-cause the Gators know what is needed to pull out a victory in a close game. 
The leadership Tebow shows in those close games on the 
way to a perfect season will allow him to steal the Heisman 
Trophy away from Colt McCoy and Sam Bradford despite 
them having better numbers.
Once the Gators get through regular season, they will not 
be stopped. By that point, it won’t matter who they circled 
because this team will be too motivated and too good to be detoured for their inevitable end of repeating as BCS National Champions.This is the most talented team both offensively and 
defensively UF has ever produced and anything less than a return to the National Championship 
game should be considered a failure.
Urban Meyer will stick to his “Our goal is to make it 
to Atlanta” mantra, but even he can’t expect everyone to 
believe UF doesn’t have aspirations higher than another 
SEC championship.
The real question isn’t 
whether or not the Gators will 
make it to Pasadena, but how impressive will they be in the process. 
UF has never gone unde-
feated and if there has ever 
been a team capable of run-
ning the table this is it. 
The Gators only real tests 
come on the road against LSU 
and a home ﬁ  nale against Florida State on senior day.
Baton Rouge is a tough place to play, but Tim Tebow 
hasn’t forgotten the loss he suffered to the Tigers in his last trip to Death Valley.
Rivalry games can only go one way for so long, which 
makes me think FSU might be the most dangerous game on the schedule.
The Seminoles appear to be poised for a return to prom-
inence, but the tears of 90,000 grown men carry Tebow and the Gators to a thrilling come-from-behind victory in the Heisman Trophy winner’s last game in the Swamp. 
No Heisman this year though. Too many blowouts 
mean Tebow won’t get the chance to pad his stats like he did in 2007.  This year the award goes to Texas quarterback 
Colt McCoy.
A rematch with Alabama in the SEC title game lacks the 
drama of last year and UF rolls to the national title game 
and a showdown with fellow juggernaut USC.
When it’s all said and done Tebow will be standing un-
derneath a shower of confetti with a rose in his mouth and a crystal ball in his hand. 
After a Hesiman Trophy and three titles in four years, 
Tebow leaves UF as the greatest college player of all time and with the win UF replaces Southern Cal as the nation’s premier program.

Though I have not seen everyone else's predictions be-
fore writing this, I would be seriously shocked if any-one predicted that the Gators will not win their third 
national championship in the last four years, something that has never been done in the history of college football.
With Tim Tebow and Brandon Spikes returning for their 
senior years, UF not only has the talent to accomplish that feat, 
but the leadership as well. 
The depth on this team is unfathom-
ably great and I'm not so sure the Gators wouldn't have a shot at repeating even if Timmy Heisman went down with an injury. 
Defensive coordinator Charlie Strong 
has talked about his unit's goal of hold-ing every team under 16 points in any one game, but if you were to cut that 
number in half, that should be just about 
what UF foes will average this season. 
I don't see any regular season game 
giving the Gators trouble, not even an October 10 matchup with LSU in vaunted Tigers Stadium. 
The toughest game on the schedule looks like FSU at home 
if you ask me (which all of you did by reading this). 
Anyway, UF will take an undefeated record into the South-
eastern Conference Championship game where they will get Ole Miss in a revenge match. 
Tebow and co. will be so jacked up to prove last season's 
loss to the Rebels was a ﬂ  uke that they rout Ole Miss by 30 points. 
Unfortunately, the nation gets a rematch of last years cham-
pionship game as UF draws one-loss Oklahoma yet again. 
The game looks signiﬁ  cantly different than last year's as 
Tebow is determined not to have a disastrous ﬁ  rst half the way he did in the Orange Bowl. 
The Gators don't come up with the critical stops in short 
yardage this time around and it becomes something of a shoo-tout between the two squads. 
In the end, UF defeats Oklahoma 42-30, cementing the ﬁ  rst 
undefeated season in school history. 
Oh, and No. 15 takes home his second Heisman Trophy and 
goes out as the greatest player in college football history. 
Why not?

kmaistri@alligator.orgDuring the offseason, I’ve been more intrigued 
with the number of shutouts the Gators will pitch than the number of losses they’ll suffer.
UF’s defense is totally stacked.
Good thing, too, because the offense will need some 
help. The loss of Percy Harvin and a so-so receiving corps 
will hurt the Gators’ attack more than you think, but they’re 
sure to get great ﬁ  eld position and plenty of possessions be-
cause of the D.
UF will post Armageddon-like 
smackdowns on Charleston South-ern, Mississippi State, Vanderbilt and FIU. Tennessee, LSU, and Geor-gia will put up respectable ﬁ  ghts but get put away in the second half, and 
the rest will be your run-of-the-mill 
three-to-four touchdown victories.
The schedule is pretty lame, but 
the postseason will be plenty of fun. The Gators will get revenge against Ole Miss in the SEC Championship, 
where Tim Tebow will put on a show before collecting his second Heisman Trophy.
From there, it’s on to Pasadena for a matchup with Texas 
and quarterback Colt McCoy, who will have ﬁ  nished sec-ond to Tebow in the Heisman voting.
Florida is the nation’s best team, hands down, but the 
playing ﬁ  eld will be leveled after the Longhorns have a month to prepare. It’s easy to forget, but if not for some red-zone blunders by Oklahoma and Ahmad Black’s incredible interception, the BCS Championship might have fallen into different hands. This time, the breaks go against the Gators.
McCoy wins it all and ﬁ  nally steps out of Tebow’s shad-
ow. If only for a moment, he’ll be the too-good-to-be-true college quarterback standing atop the world.
How could I make such a ridiculous pick? Karma.UF fans have watched their basketball and football teams 
dominate on the national stage in recent years, and they’re due for a fall. This isn’t how the world works.
If I’m right, consider UF’s karmic debt for all this win-
ning paid off. If I’m wrong, start buying lottery tickets.
Mike McCall
McCall-in’ It 
Like I See It
mmccall@alligator.orgAnother year, another opportunity for UF fans to hate 
me for my prediction. 
Then again, I had the 2008 Gators losing the SEC 
East to Georgia, so that was a huge swing-and-a-miss.
I will, however, stick with two predictions I made a year 
ago: Tebow will win his second Heisman in 2009, and the biggest X-factor surrounding the season is Percy Harvin’s 
absence.
Andre Debose does not equal 
Percy Harvin. And I'm beginning to believe four guys can't equal Percy Harvin, either.
There are guys that can catch 
passes (to varying degrees), and 
some who are quick and elusive with 
the ball. I'm just not convinced the Gators will have enough threats to make opposing defensive coordina-tors cringe.
What UF will have plenty of is defense. I believe the 
Gators will have a legendary defense, one that is remem-bered for years to come. 
The closest regular-season affair will be Arkansas, but 
Tim Tebow and Brandon Spikes will refuse to have another Ole Miss-like blemish and win by 10.
The talk of an undefeated season will continue through 
the SEC Championship Game when UF gets its revenge against Ole Miss. From Dec. 5 (the SEC title game) to Jan. 7 (the BCS title game), people will talk about the Gators as one of the most dominant teams in college football history. They will talk about an average win margin that is in the 30s.
Everyone will forget similar mistakes from four years 
ago. The 2005 USC team was all set to repeat as national champs and rolled through its regular-season schedule un-til it faced a team from Texas that didn't get the memo to roll over.
Colt McCoy and the Longhorns are about to pull some 
deja vu. The Texas quarterback will be enraged after ﬁ  nish-ing second in the Heisman race for the second straight year and will shred UF's defense like no one could all year.
Tim Tebow's college career will end in tears in Pasade-
na.
Longhorns 31, Gators 30.

TUESDAYat 7:30his off-field persona and the potential for an-
other big year, have led some to crown him as one of the best college football players ever.
“If he would do either one, or maybe both, I 
think he’ll go down as one of the great leaders 
and great stories in college football history,” 
ESPN analyst and former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz said. “The Ernie Davises and Ar-chie Griffins — although Archie didn’t win a national championship — some of the people who really accomplished great things.”
That hole in Griffin’s resume is exactly 
where UF coach Urban Meyer believes his player stands apart from the rest.
“I always think the quarterback’s job, the 
point guard’s job, the Michael Jordan’s job, is to win,” Meyer said. “Tim has the label of a winner. He won a state championship in high school, he’s done tremendous in college so far, and he has another year left. Without ques-tion, he’ll be in that conversation.”
Tebow shies away from such talk. His competitive nature gives him a desire 
to be the best, but he gets visibly restless and 
uncomfortable when the subject is brought up, 
doing his best to deflect it.
“I’d just rather not hear about that until I’m 
done with college and everything,” he said. “I just want to go work and get isolated away from everything else. It’s definitely humbling, and it’s an honor when people talk about it or write something, but I don’t want to hear it.”
Fueling His Fire
What Tebow does want to hear are re-
minders of the Ole Miss game last season and the concerns that he won’t make a good pro, though he says the latter has been generated more by reporters than by coaches.
It was clear how badly Tebow wanted 
an undefeated season during his emotional speech after the loss to the Rebels, and it’s clear now that the game still bothers him.
“It does, especially when 
you hear, ‘How did you feel about that 4th-and-short when you got stuffed?’” Tebow said, referring to a question from earlier in the interview. “It def-initely does. A comment like 
that will even motivate me more because I get irritated about that.”
Although the Gators ran roughshod over 
opponents following the upset and attribut-ed some of their success to the wake-up call, Tebow can’t look back on it without being bothered. 
“It’s cool the change we made from there, 
but I think if you ask (Brandon) Spikes, the Pounceys or anyone, they’ll still say it irritates them,” Tebow said. “It’s a good thing, but it’s never a good thing. That loss is still frustrat-
ing to everybody although a lot of good came 
from it. 
“That’s one of the good things about our 
team though — just how upset and mad we get about something like that. …We still use that today in practice.”
The more Tebow thinks about that game, 
the more determined he is to prevent it from happening again.
And if he can lead the Gators to their first-
ever undefeated season, there will be little doubt as to his place in the program’s history.

UF sophomore opposite hitter/setter Kelly Murphy (right) hopes to avoid a dropoff after 
becoming the Gators’ first AVCA National Freshman of the Year in 2008.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
Kelly Murphy isn’t worried about a 
sophomore slump. 
UF’s first-ever AVCA National Fresh-
man of the Year will start her second season 
in Gainesville with plenty of expectations to live up to, but she is taking them all in stride.
“There’s always pressure because every-
one’s going to be expecting me to match up to what happened last year,” Murphy said. “I’m just excited to start playing again. I’m ready for the season to start.”
In 2008, Murphy performed about as ef-
ficiently and impressively as anyone could have expected from the nation’s top recruit. She broke the school record for career tri-ple-doubles with six in her first 27 matches as a freshman.
Murphy finished the year leading the 
team in kills (357) and hitting percentage (.358) and second in assists (610) and digs (209) while recording 12 straight double-doubles during Southeastern Conference play.
“For a freshman to come in and be that 
dominant, it’s kind of unheard of,” senior libero Elyse Cusack said. “But she’s an ex-ceptional player, and she’s a special player. I’m just glad she’s on my team.”
After a productive offseason in 
Gainesville, Murphy is back on the court and, according to her coach and teammates, better than ever. The versatile opposite hitter/setter spent 
the spring improving her setting, and the team’s offseason conditioning and weight lifting has made her faster and fitter than she was during her record-setting first year at UF.
Add a season of experience at the col-
lege level and stronger team chemistry, and Murphy has established a sense of confi-dence in her ability and her teammates that should allow her to develop as a leader. Murphy said she hopes to become a more vocal and emotional presence on the court, a role that should come more naturally without the occasional nervousness she felt as a freshman.
Although all signs point to Murphy hav-
ing improved nearly every aspect of her game, her teammates said she just needs to be as good as she was last year for the team to be successful.
“Murph, she just has to be Murph, hon-
estly,” junior opposite hitter Lauren Bled-soe said. “There’s not too much that she has to do. If she just does a nice little repeat of last year, I’ll be fine with that.”
But after a full spring and summer of 
training at UF, Murphy is prepared to do more in 2009 than just rehash her freshman campaign. Gators coach Mary Wise called her one of the most competitive players on the team, a trait that should keep her mo-tivated to continue improving throughout her time in Gainesville.
“She wants to win and will do anything 
to win,” Wise said. “If I asked her to be our libero, she would do it to win.”UF VOLLEYBALLMurphy looks to top ’0848, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009

UF junior setter Brynja Rodgers, a transfer from New Mexico 
State, will look to compensate for the loss of Cindy Bathelt.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
During the offseason, the Gators 
lost their starting setter to another 
school, but they added a transfer of 
their own to make up for it.
Sophomore Cindy Bathelt left UF 
for the University of Colorado at 
Colorado Springs in June. A native 
of Colorado Springs, Bathelt chose 
to attend school and continue play-ing in her hometown despite her ini-tial success with the Gators.
“I think it was just homesick-
ness,” sophomore outside hitter and fellow Colorado native Kristy Jaeck-el said. “We were a little surprised by it, but we wish her the best of 
luck and hope she does the best she 
can wherever she ends up.” 
Replacing Bathelt will not be easy 
for UF coach Mary Wise. Bathelt led the Gators with 623 assists as one of 
five freshmen who saw meaningful 
playing time for UF in 2008.
Wise, who was a setter at Purdue 
and has lectured about the position 
at national coaches’ conferences,  
added two more distributors to her roster this year. She recruited fresh-man Sundai Weston and pursued Brynja Rodgers, then a sophomore at New Mexico State, to compensate for the loss of Bathelt. 
Wise first tried to touch base with 
Rodgers through her hometown 
coaches in Iowa. They passed along 
the message to her coach at NMSU, who advised Rodgers to get in touch with Wise. 
“She kind of sought after me, 
which I thought was kind of cool,” Rodgers said. “Playing for the Uni-versity of Florida is something all volleyball players dream about, and 
getting the chance to actually do it 
— I took that chance right away.”
The junior setter is still learning 
the intricacies of UF’s 6-2 offense, 
but her adjustment has been made 
easier by her experience in a similar system while at NMSU. 
As a sophomore, Rodgers played 
in 23 of the Aggies’ 35 matches, but she saw the floor in only 34 sets, re-
cording 86 assists.
As the “new kid” for the Gators, 
Rodgers said she has felt some pres-
sure, and the program’s decorated 
history — including 18 straight 
Southeastern Conference champion-ships — says all she needs to know about the extremely high expecta-tions she will face in Gainesville.
NMSU finished 26-9 and shared 
the Western Athletic Conference regular-season title during Rodgers’ sophomore year, but the Gators’ 
lofty postseason goals — anything 
less than a Sweet 16 appearance would be considered a disappoint-ment — have been emphasized more than she was used to.
Despite the expectations, her 
coaches and teammates have ex-pressed their confidence in Rodgers’ ability to make a successful transi-
tion to UF and help fill the void left 
by Bathelt.
“We expect the same as we 
would’ve expected out of Cindy,” sophomore opposite hitter/setter 
Kelly Murphy said. “We’ve got to spread the ball around and get good 
sets to all our hitters.”Transfers create, fill hole at setter

At the UF volleyball team’s me-
dia day on Aug. 13, Lauren Bledsoe 
could barely contain her excitement 
when asked about senior Kristina 
Johnson.
The question regarding John-
son’s recovery from the nagging 
knee injury she dealt with last year 
had barely ended when Bledsoe 
began to praise “KJ,” as her team-
mates call her.
“Oh, you guys have no idea. In 
practice, when she’s hitting, it’s 
amazing,” Bledsoe said. “It’s so ef-fortless, literally. When she jumps 
up to hit, it’s so easy for her, and 
she’s so powerful. There’s no tenta-tiveness about her.”
The praise for Johnson didn’t 
stop with Bledsoe. Junior transfer Brynja Rodgers said the 6-foot-2 middle blocker was the player she was most excited about setting for, detalining how talented and physi-
cally impressive she has been dur-
ing two-a-days.
Coach Mary Wise added her sap-
proval as well, telling reporters this was the year Johnson, who strug-
gled with an injury in her surgically 
repaired knee last season, would fi-nally reach her full potential. 
“A year ago today, she had just 
been cleared to play the day before, 
and she had no summer to train, no 
spring,” Wise said. “That knee is completely healed. This year, our fans will see the Kristina Johnson 
we had hoped we would have be-
fore the injury.”
Johnson’s trou-
bles with her knee 
and then-senior 
Kelsey Bowers’ 
back injury plagued the middle blocker 
position for the Gators in 2008. 
Although it led to inconsistent 
play and forced players into unfa-miliar roles, it may have had the unintentional benefit of adding depth at the position. 
Week to week, middle blocker 
was a question for the Gators last year.
With Bowers and Johnson oc-
casionally sidelined, Cassandra Anderson played extra rotations as a freshman — she played in 25 matches and started 15 — and fin-ished the year with an average of just more than one block and one kill per game.
Now in her sophomore year, An-
derson will split time with Johnson and redshirt freshman Betsy Smith in a unit that is looking to increase its output of blocks and kills in 
2009. 
Wise has repeatedly stressed the 
importance of outblocking oppo-
nents as a key to winning matches, 
and the Gators proved the effect 
a blocking advantage can have in their two matches against Colorado State last season.
In the regular season, the Gators 
were outblocked 12-2 in an 3-0 loss to the Rams. In the postseason, UF turned that around and had nine blocks to Colorado State’s five in a 
3-0 victory to advance to the Sweet 
16.
To make it further than the 
Sweet 16 this year, the trio of mid-dle blockers is just hoping to finally 
stay healthy for an entire season.
 “Our middles are going to be a 
really good presence on our team 
this year, a lot stronger than they 
have been in the past,” outside hit-
ter Kristy Jaeckel said. “No matter who’s on the court, we’re going to get a good showing out of them.”Johnson’s knee fully recovered

Much of the talk during fall 
camp has centered on filling the 
void left by do-it-all receiver Per-
cy Harvin, but the production of 
fellow former Gator Louis Mur-phy may prove to be just as hard to replace.
“People always talk about re-
placing Percy. At the same time, people forget about how critical Murph was in us being successful last year,” wide receivers coach 
Billy Gonzales said. 
Murphy caught 38 balls for 
655 yards and seven touchdowns 
during the Gators’ national-title 
run in 2008. 
His sure hands and 6-foot-2 
frame made him a go-to option 
for quarterback Tim Tebow last year.
“You put him on another team 
and he’s probably an All-Amer-ican,” UF coach Urban Meyer said. “That’s how good a player 
he was. Right now, we’re having a hard time filling his void.”
The two likely replacements 
for Murphy are senior Riley Cooper and sophomore Deonte 
Thompson. 
Cooper spent the summer playing baseball and recently agreed to a professional contract with the Texas Rangers. He start-ed 12 games last season but only has 30 career receptions. 
It could take time for Cooper 
to work his way back into foot-
ball shape.
“Cooper has been there, he’s 
played in every game, he’s a 
starter for us,” Gonzales said. “I 
trust Cooper. I trust him with ev-
erything out there. 
“I’ve got to get that kind of 
trust in the other guys.”
Thompson played mostly on 
special teams last season, catch-ing just 18 passes on the year. 
But he has speed and has 
shown that he can stretch the de-
fense and be a threat down the 
field.
“I hope Deonte is ready right 
now. He’s performing,” Gonzales said. “I want Deonte to play as 
hard as Murph, as hard as Dallas 
Baker, as hard as Bubba Caldwell. Murph was developed. 
“He didn’t happen overnight. 
He grew on special teams. Deon-te last year basically was a special teams player and has worked his way.”
Gonzales said Cooper and 
Thompson continue to split reps at the position during practice.Replacing Murphy proving to be tougher than expectedMONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 51

Wide receiver Deonte Thompson will be counted upon to play an integral role in UF’s offense this fall. 
The sophomore, along with seniors Riley Cooper and David Nelson, are the top wideouts right now.

west east
ALABAMA
Coach: Nick Saban (14-8 at UA, ﬁ  ve wins from 2007 vacated by NCAA)
2008 record: 12-2 (8-0 SEC)
Players to watch: WR Julio Jones, DT Terrence Cody, CB/KR Javier Arenas, LB 
Rolando McClain, RB Mark Ingram.Overview: The Crimson Tide will have to break in new quarterback Greg McEl-
roy, and he’ll lead an offense that returns just four starters from last season, 
though he’ll still have one of the nation’s best wideouts in Jones. The defense 
should be just as good as 2008, but it remains to be seen whether McElroy and 
Ingram can provide the ﬁ  repower to navigate a tough schedule.Key Games: Sept. 5 vs. Virginia Tech (Atlanta), Oct. 10 at Mississippi, Nov. 7 vs. 
LSU.
ARKANSAS
Coach: Bobby Petrino (5-7 at UA)2008 record: 5-7 (2-6 SEC)
Players to watch: TE D.J. Williams, QB Ryan Mallett, RB Michael Smith, DT Mal-
colm Sheppard, LB Jerry Franklin.Overview: There doesn’t seem to be enough room in the SEC West race for the 
Razorbacks, but if former Michigan quarterback Mallett gets off to a quick start, 
they could turn some heads. Arkansas faces the league’s toughest schedule 
though, and there’s little reason to think the team can improve on last year’s 1-4 
road record as trips to Alabama, Florida, Ole Miss and LSU loom.Key Games: Sept. 26 at Alabama, Oct. 17 at Florida, Oct. 24 at Mississippi.
AUBURN
Coach: Gene Chizik (ﬁ  rst year at AU)2008 record: 5-7 (2-6 SEC)Players to watch: RB Ben Tate, QB Chris Todd, DE Antonio Coleman, OT Lee Ziemba, DE Antoine Carter.
Overview: Chizik inherits an experienced team, but the Tigers have lost their spot 
in the West’s top three to Ole Miss. Todd and dual threat Kodi Burns are both average quarterbacks, and the offense is running its fourth system in three years. The defense has the talent to hold its own, but can Todd & Co. put up enough points?Key Games: Sept. 19 vs. West Virginia, Oct. 31 vs. Mississippi, Nov. 27 vs. Ala-bama.
LSU
Coach: Les Miles (42-11 at LSU)2008 record: 8-5 (3-5 SEC)Players to watch: RB Charles Scott, WR Brandon LaFell, KR Trindon Holliday, DE Rahim Alem, QB Jordan Jefferson.Overview: The Tigers will be improved from last season, but they must conquer a brutal schedule. Scott and Keiland Williams are solid ball carriers and the receiv-ing corps is talented, but Jefferson is unproven and the offense will only go as far as he takes it. LSU’s defense allowed 24.2 points per game last year, the team’s worst in the last decade, but the seven returning starters will be looking to change that. Key Games: Oct. 10 vs. Florida, Nov. 7 at Alabama, Nov. 21 at Mississippi
5  0 MISSISSIPPI STATE
Coach: Dan Mullen (ﬁ  rst year at MSU)
2008 record: 4-8 (2-6 SEC)Players to watch: RB Anthony Dixon, LB Jamar Chaney, WR Brandon McRae, QB Tyson Lee, LB K.J. Wright.Overview: Mullen has his work cut out for him. The Bulldogs are in the West’s cellar, and it’ll take some serious work to climb out. MSU will lean heavily on Dixon, and Lee and Chris Relf are locked in a battle for the starting QB spot. The Bulldogs return 10 total starters from a 2008 squad that allowed 24.7 points per game and scored just 15.2, and there’s little room for optimism at this point. Key Games: Oct. 3 vs. Georgia Tech, Oct. 24 vs. Florida, Nov. 28 vs. Mississippi.
GEORGIA
Coach: Mark Richt (82-22 at UGA)
2008 record: 10-3 (6-2 SEC)
Players to watch: WR A.J. Green, QB Joe Cox, LB Rennie Curran, RB Caleb King, 
S Reshad Jones.Overview: Cox will try and duplicate D.J. Shockley’s feat of winning the SEC in 
his only year as a starter, but the Bulldogs will have to get past the Gators to do 
so. King will be dynamic in the backﬁ  eld if he can overcome injuries and Green 
is an elite receiver, but the pressure will be on UGA’s defense to improve on its 
24.5 points per game allowed last year, the school’s worst since 1999. Key Games: Sept. 5 at Oklahoma St., Oct. 3 vs. LSU, Oct. 31 vs. Florida (Jackson-
ville).
KENTUCKY
Coach: Rich Brooks (32-41 at UK)2008 record: 7-6 (2-6 SEC)
Players to watch: CB Trevard Lindley, WR Randall Cobb, LB Micah Johnson, QB 
Mike Hartline, RB Alfonso Smith.Overview: Brooks has some solid playmakers in the above-mentioned names, 
but Hartline will need to be more consistent for the offense to click. Cobb showed 
last year that he can pass, run and catch at a high level, and he will be a constant 
threat. Johnson and Lindley are solid NFL prospects, but they’re two of just four 
returning starters to a defense that struggled late last season. Kentucky is likely looking at a battle for the ﬁ  fth spot in the East.
Key Games: Sept. 26 vs. Florida, Oct. 3 vs. Alabama, Nov. 21 at Georgia.
SOUTH CAROLINA
Coach: Steve Spurrier (28-22 at USC)
2008 record: 7-6 (4-4 SEC)Players to watch: QB Stephen Garcia, LB Eric Norwood, RB Jarvis Giles, WR Alshon Jeffery, S Chris Culliver.Overview: Garcia was a highly touted recruit, and after overcoming off-ﬁ  eld problems, it’s time for him to reach his potential. The offense will need contribu-tions from some talented freshmen, and Norwood has to keep up his all-world performances to hold the defense together. With a tough schedule ahead, the Gamecocks will have an uphill battle to notch their ﬁ  rst winning conference re-cord since 2005.Key Games: Sept. 24 vs. Mississippi, Oct. 17 at Alabama, Nov. 14 vs. Florida.
TENNESSEE
Coach: Lane Kifﬁ  n (ﬁ  rst year at UT)2008 record: 5-7 (3-5 SEC)Players to watch: S Eric Berry, QB Jonathan Crompton, LB Rico McCoy, WR Gerald Jones, RB Montario Hardesty.Overview: Kifﬁ  n did a lot of talking during the offseason, and now it’s time to back it up. Crompton is looking to erase the disappointment of last season, and he has a talented crop of backs behind him to help out. The secondary is the strength of the defense, led by Berry, and they’ll aim to keep holding opponents to the stout 16.8 points per game they allowed last year. Can Kifﬁ  n’s talented freshmen handle three tough road games?Key Games: Sept. 19 at Florida, Oct. 24 at Alabama, Nov. 14 at Mississippi.
VANDERBILT
Coach: Bobby Johnson (27-56 at VU)2008 record: 7-6 (4-4 SEC)Players to watch: QB Mackenzi Adams, QB Larry Smith, LB Patrick Benoist, LB Chris Marve, CB Myron Lewis.Overview: The Commodores return plenty of starters, but it’ll be a struggle to ﬁ  nish with a 4-4 conference record again this season. Vandy will be on the road every other week for a total of six away games. VU mostly survived off of turn-overs last year, and without those same breaks in 2009, it’ll be tough to make it two bowl games in a row.Key Games: Sept. 12 at LSU, Oct. 3 vs. Mississippi, Nov. 7 at Florida.By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
MISSISSIPPI
Coach: Houston Nutt (9-4 at UM)2008 record: 9-4 (5-3 SEC)Players to watch: QB Jevan Snead, WR/RB Dexter McCluster, S Kendrick Lewis, WR Shay Hodge, DE Greg Hardy.Overview:  The Rebels are the darling SEC West pick after upsetting Florida, LSU and Texas Tech last year. Expectations are higher in Oxford than they’ve been in a long time, and much of that pressure will fall on Snead, who has gotten some dark-horse Heisman talk. Ole Miss’ schedule sets up nicely, and with plenty of returning starters, the key will be handling the hype. The Rebels will be hunted rather than hunting.Key Games: Oct. 10 vs. Alabama, Oct. 24 vs. Arkansas, Nov. 21 vs. LSU.By KYLE MAISTRI

Call UF’s defense intimidating. 
Call it deep. Call it limitless in its 
potential. 
Just don’t call it bend-but-don’t-
break. Not this year. 
“No defense likes to hear that 
we’re a bend-but-don’t-break defense,” defensive tackle Ter-ron Sanders said. “One thing you 
would love to hear somebody say is 
that defense is a brick wall. Nobody 
can run through them, nobody can complete a pass. That would be one of the good goals that we have is 
not allowing so many yards, not al-
lowing so many yards through the 
air.” 
The Gators allowed 285 yards 
per game in 2008, and 180 of those 
came through opponent’s passing 
games. 
When Ole Miss handed UF its 
only loss in The Swamp last season, 
it was an 86-yard pass play from Je-
van Snead to Shay Hodge that put 
the Rebels up 31-24 with just more 
than five minutes to play. 
Linebacker Brandon Spikes said 
that loss still motivates the team to 
this day, and he expects the defense 
to be even better than the unit that 
allowed 12.9 points per game a sea-
son ago. The way to do that is by getting 
off the field faster than ever. 
“I feel like we have the talent 
to go three-and-out every series,” Spikes said. “That bend-but-don’t-break, sometimes that will get you 
in a hole, so we just try to go three-and-out.”If the defense is able to clamp 
down right from the beginning of every series, Tim Tebow and the offense might not have time to do much more than grab a drink of 
water between offensive posses-
sions. 
“We allowed people to drive 
the ball last year,” defensive coor-dinator Charlie Strong said. “What we need to do is just go out there and be ready to play right from the start.”
That type of attitude is being 
formed in training camp, where complacency was targeted as the first opponent on UF’s schedule. 
Every day, the players are an-
swering questions on whether or not this defense has the makings of one of the greatest of all time. 
For those players who answered 
affirmatively, Strong has a mes-sage. 
“If you’re going to sell those 
tickets, you better be ready to cash them,” he said. 
Leadership is sure to play a big 
role in the mentality of the unit, and Strong can count on Spikes and fel-low senior linebacker Ryan Stamp-er to provide plenty of that. 
When Charleston Southern 
rolls into Gainesville on Sept. 5, the Gators will be ready to prove to ev-ery team on the slate that they’re dead set on not suffering another letdown. 
“If we come out thinking we’re 
the big bad Florida Gators, people could beat us,” Spikes said.UF DEFENSEGators hope to shed ‘bend-but-don’t-break’ labelMONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 53

Ends Justin Trattou (94), Carlos Dunlap (8) and Jermaine Cunningham (49) and linebacker Brandon 
Spikes (51) are all parts of a defense that comes into the season striving for more three-and-outs.

� ELLIOTT LIFTS FLORIDA PAST 
MIAMI IN 1-0 ROAD WIN.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
Senior Ashlee Elliott promised pizazz this 
year and delivered after one game.
After a scoreless first half against in-state 
rival Miami, Elliott scored what turned out 
to be the game-winning goal on a header sent in from Tricia Townsend.
Before classes even started, the Gators 
soccer team went to work and nabbed a 1-0 
win over the Hurricanes in Coral Gables on 
Friday night.
“A lot more excitement, a lot more pi-
zazz,” Elliott said about this year’s team. “I feel like there’s going to be a lot more cre-ativity.”
UF coach Becky Burleigh said her team 
exhibited more nerves than rust.
“To have a chance to get a lot of freshmen 
get experience, to start on the road, to get the win was a good result for us,” Burleigh said. 
The Gators’ first match of the season was 
a learning experience for a team with 25 un-derclassmen on the 33-woman roster.
“It was good to get a chance to actually 
play another team and just for the freshmen to get to see what college soccer is all about,” goalkeeper Katie Fraine said.
Fraine racked up five saves en route to 
her shutout and sealed the win as the Hurri-canes applied pressure late with shots in the 89th and 90th minutes.
“It was just awesome to get to see our 
ideas and creativity work against a team that didn’t know what was coming,” Fraine said.
Fraine acknowledged the first game 
wasn’t the prettiest but that some rust was to 
be expected with a younger team.
“We’re not going to be mad 
at them, it’s their first game,” 
Elliott said. “I was there, and I’m not going to blame them if they miss a pass, miss a goal.”
Youth hasn’t quelled the 
preseason hype.
The Gators (1-0-0) headed into this season 
ranked 10th in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) preseason poll and were also picked by league coaches as the preseason favorite to win the South-eastern Conference.
“For this team and the level of talent we 
have, being able to establish ourselves at home and on the road is both very impor-
tant,” Burleigh said.Gators win season opener

Florida linebacker Dustin Doe settled 
his legal issues Thursday, but coach Ur-
ban Meyer said he hasn’t completely re-joined the Gators yet.
Meyer said the senior will be suspend-
ed at least one game, although no final decision has been made.
Doe has not practiced with the team 
this fall after being suspended  in late July following his arrest for driving with a suspended license. Doe is currently train-ing individually while he tries to regain his playing shape.
Doe pled guilty Thursday to driving 
with a suspended license and driving without a valid license. The first charge came with a sentence of a year of unsu-pervised probation, a $300 fine and 16 hours of work detail. The second charge resulted in six months of unsupervised probation, another $300 fine and another eight hours of work detail.
Doe’s suspended li-
cense had been caused by outstanding traffic tickets.
“He’s a good guy, 
but don’t drive,” 
Meyer said Friday. “Don’t drive. I don’t understand it. I don’t want to make light 
of a guy’s career, because he has a lot of promise. The great thing is it’s not over. We’re certainly not turning our back on a guy for that kind of a situation. However, 
you live in the United States of America 
and there are laws. Follow the laws.”

 Editor’s Note: This is the ﬁ  rst of 
a four-part alligatorSports series in which we examine whether college athletes deserve to be paid for their athletic efforts.  
By LAURA KUBITZ,  KYLE  
MAISTRI and MIKE McCALL 
 Alligator Writers 
  
 When Tim Tebow left Ponte Ve-
dra Nease High School for the Uni-
versity of Florida, his coach kept his helmet.
Craig Howard didn’t want it as 
a memento to remind him of the quarterback he helped mold into an eventual Heisman Trophy winner, and he wasn’t looking to make a quick buck by selling it. 
Howard stowed it away at Nease 
for the opposite reason: to keep someone else from selling it.
That’s also why Howard — who 
now coaches at Lake City Columbia High — didn’t sell jerseys bearing Tebow’s No. 5, a venture that surely would have raised lots of money for the Panthers’ program.
“I thought about it, but I thought 
it would be too much commercial-ism,” Howard said. “We could have made money off of it, but guys like that come along only a few times. 
“I was always very protective of 
Timmy’s stuff.”
Though Howard has certainly 
gained from coaching Tebow — he won a state title and coached a game on ESPN — he is one of the few peo-ple who hasn’t taken advantage of a 
chance to make money off him.
Sometime between an athlete’s 
ﬁ  nal prep contest and his arrival on 
a college campus, that line is broken. From one amateur, student-athlete-driven sports association to another, it becomes commonplace for people to make large proﬁ  ts off of players. 
And since arriving in Gainesville, Tebow has become a cash cow. 
The UF Bookstore, located 
on campus, sold around 2,000 of Tebow’s No. 15 jerseys last year. That’s a rate of 166 per month, rang-ing in price from $75 to $150.
A search on eBay.com for “Tim 
Tebow” nets 393 results, ranging from 99-cent football cards to an au-tographed jersey up for $515.15.
At The Perfect Gift, a shop locat-
ed in Haile Village, a painting titled “Lord of The Swamp” that featured Tebow running through the Okla-homa defense with Bible verses placed all over him was on the mar-ket for $6,500. At the Haile Village Art Fair outside the store last spring, more paintings, sketches and even 
jewelry bearing Tebow’s likeness or 
jersey number were for sale.
His image has sold magazines, 
newspapers, highlight videos and T-shirts. His play on the ﬁ  eld has sold tickets and earned UF millions for playing in high-proﬁ  le bowl games.
And as Howard points out, a 
10-year-old Tebow family Christmas 
card went for $50 online last fall.
“It’s almost disgusting,” Howard 
said. “So many people make money 
off of athletes and off of sports, and a lot of times the athletes don’t get any ﬁ  nancial reward from it.”
Due to NCAA rules, Tebow is 
prevented from beneﬁ  ting ﬁ  nancial-ly as a result of his status as an ath-lete. He even has to jump through hoops just to do charity work.
In the week leading up to UF’s 
spring football game, Tebow partic-ipated in charity events that raised around $300,000 for the children’s 
hospital at Shands at UF and an or-
phanage in the Philippines.
Tebow was only allowed to help 
after months of dialogue with the NCAA to ensure that Tebow, his family and his father’s ministry, the Bob Tebow Evangelistic Associa-tion, would not beneﬁ  t.“I don’t really care about get-
ting paid, but sometimes I do wish I could do more charity work and help out with stuff like that,” Tebow said.
It seems everyone is making 
money off Tim Tebow except for Tim Tebow, but some believe he has the ability to change the college system.
After the 2007 Heisman Trophy 
presentation, professor Rick Karch-er, who heads the Center for Law and Sports at the Florida Coastal School of Law, sent Tebow a letter congratulating him on the win.
The letter also urged Tebow to 
sue the commercial entities proﬁ  ting from his identity, which would not 
cause a loss of eligibility. If Tebow 
were to be awarded damages, Karcher wrote, it would be too late for the NCAA to punish him.
“But by the time you receive that 
judgment, you will have already exhausted your eligibility,” Karcher wrote in the letter, which he later published on the Internet. “Your 
lawsuit could be the impetus for the 
NCAA to begin negotiating with its licensees for an annual royalty to be held in trust for the beneﬁ  t of colle-giate athletes in the future, without destroying their eligibility.”
Karcher’s idea was that Tebow 
could do for college sports what Curt Flood did for free agency in baseball. But the debate about pay-ing student-athletes is long and twisted, with legal issues, gender equality, economics and the spirit of amateurism all playing a role. 
 The Football Machine 
 Because there is no fair system to 
pay college athletes, and doing so under current rules would remove their eligibility, Tebow and his teammates are not able to cash in on their work.
According to the U.S. Depart-ment of Education, the UF football program generated more than $66 million in 2007-08, while the men’s basketball program brought in $9.9 million. After expenses, those teams made $47.2 million and $2.1 mil-
lion, respectively, while all other UF 
sports recorded a net loss of $13.5 million.
It’s clear that the gridiron Gators 
are the framework holding the ath-letics program together.
“The ability of our football pro-
gram to generate signiﬁ  cant dollars is the key component to our ﬁ  nan-
cial stability,” the UAA stated in its 
2008-2009 budget summary.
The numbers will be much larger 
for the 2008 season.
The UAA projected to make $8.6 
million in Southeastern Conference revenue from bowl games, televi-sion contracts and championships, $2.1 million from advertising and 
$29.9 million in donations from 
boosters.
Also, since Tebow’s jersey hit 
the shelves, licensing revenues have almost doubled to a projected $4 million, a number that will likely be surpassed in the wake of the Gators’ recent national title.
Those numbers, especially from 
the football team, have convinced many that the athletes doing the work on the ﬁ  eld deserve a cut. 
“Honestly, I think we should get 
a little something,” cornerback Joe Haden said. “When you look at all the money coming in for the games and everything, [the university gets] all the money. It wouldn’t hurt for 
us to just get a little something.”
Of the Gators’ 122 players, 85 are 
on athletic scholarships, ranging in 
value from $12,300 for in-state stu-dents to $29,150 for non-Floridians. The scholarships cover tuition, housing, a meal plan and books, and there are other beneﬁ  ts that come with being a student-athlete, such as 
trainers, tutors and special advisers 
to help with scheduling.
“There’s a lot of other things they 
do for us,” wide receiver David Nel-son said. “If there’s an emergency and we have to go home, they’ll pay for our ﬂ  ight. They do a great job of taking care of us, and they provide us with meal plans and housing, so there really isn’t that much else that we need.”
The bases are covered, Haden 
said, but in the shadow of coach Urban Meyer’s $4 million-per-year contract and the program’s sky-high revenues and success, the players should get a little more.
“We have a meal plan at the din-
ing hall, and not to be talking down about it, but it’s the same food all 
the time, and sometimes you don’t 
want to go there,” Haden said. “You might want to take your girl out to eat or something.”
Big-time players are sure to 
cash in on their careers eventually. Tebow will likely have endorse-ments and a pro contract waiting for him this spring, and he took out an 
insurance policy to guard against an 
injury derailing his plans.
But for those without a future in 
athletics, earning a degree is every-thing.
According to the U.S. Census 
Bureau, adults with a college degree earn four times more than those with less than a high school diploma. A 
high school dropout, on average, 
earned about $20,873 in 2006 while a person with an advanced college degree earned about $82,320.  
Those beneﬁ  ts aren’t lost on safe-
ty Major Wright, who plans to use his communications degree to pur-sue a broadcasting career after foot-ball. But he still believes he should 
be compensated with a stipend.
“The majority of our time as a 
student-athlete is either studying or 
on the ﬁ  eld,” Wright said. “I feel like we should be paid because we’re here 24/7. We’re here during the breaks when other people go home, and even though our team is like a family, we can’t get to be with our 
immediate family much. Taking 
that away can push some people down sometimes.”

SACKS IN 2008.
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator.org
Carlos Dunlap stepped into the 
national spotlight in January, but 
that may have been just the begin-ning.
The defensive end earned Defen-
sive MVP honors during UF’s 24-14 win over Oklahoma in the BCS Na-tional Championship Game and ad-mits to being recognized more than ever.
The scary thought for UF oppo-
nents is the junior says he reached only half of his potential in 2008, a year in which he blocked three punts 
and led the team with 9.5 sacks.
He tallied those stats while split-
ting time with Justin Trattou, but the breakout season has Dunlap primed 
to be the starter opposite Jermaine Cunningham in 2009. 
“Last year, it was just hard to get 
Dunlap to run from me to that door,” said defensive coordinator Charlie Strong, referring to a door about six feet away. “I think that what helped him was being MVP last year of the 
national championship game. He’s 
got so much publicity. He’s taken that upon himself to be a better foot-ball player.”
Then again, Dunlap’s potential 
was never in question. The 6-foot-6, 290-pounder has always earned praise for his freakish athletic ability and physique.
He returned kickoffs in high 
school. Strong has seen Dunlap catch a ball carrier from behind. 
But it was a different story when he arrived in Gainesville as the fifth-best recruit in the country, according to Rivals.com. 
Struggling with the pressure, 
coaches saw him as lazy. Just last week, coach Urban Meyer charac-terized Dunlap as a “dog” his fresh-man year.
“When I came in, a lot was ex-
pected of me,” Dunlap said. “When I messed up, coaches got on me, and I took it the wrong way.
“Everybody that comes to Florida 
is a star at their high school. When they get here, they expect to make 
plays like they did in high school.”
The last year has seen quite a 
transformation from Dunlap. His 
‘08 success has him training harder than ever during two-a-days, and coaches and teammates can’t help but praise his newfound work ethic.
Defensive line coach Dan Mc-
Carney said he has seen a change in 
maturity from meetings to the prac-
tice field. Fellow lineman Earl Okine looks up to Dunlap and says he doesn’t want to let his upperclass-man teammate down.
“His practice habits (this fall) 
have been better than they’ve ever been,” McCarney said. “I never had one issue with him on game day.
“He just needed to put more em-
phasis on (practice) and give more effort and be more relentless and just practice better and prepare bet-ter, and he’s doing that right now.”
In addition to the Gators’ quest to 
repeat as national champs, Dunlap still has some things to prove.
He has targeted Alex Brown’s 
single-season record of 13 sacks set in 1999, and McCarney agrees he’s capable of breaking that mark. Scout.com currently has Dunlap slotted as the eighth-best defensive end if he were to leave UF and enter the 2010 NFL Draft.
But for now, he’ll just keep wor-
rying about practice.Breakout season leaves Dunlap wanting moreMONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 57

UF defensive end Carlos Dunlap initially struggled to develop his work ethic but is receiving lots of praise 
this fall. The junior has targeted the Alex Brown’s single-season school record of 13 sacks, set in 1999.

“Smokey, this is not ‘Nam. This 
is bowling. There are rules.”
That is one of my favorite movie 
quotes, delivered by John Good-
man as Walter Sobchak in The Big Lebowski. 
Sports fandom is also unlike 
‘Nam. There are rules to this as well.  
What are the rules of sports loy-
alty? 
I’m glad you asked. Too many times our friends are 
quick to pull a maneuver that draws our ire, jumping recklessly from bandwagon to bandwagon without dignity or nobility in mind. 
After meditating on the matter 
at hand and discussing the subject 
with a well-respected colleague and 
friend of mine (Mike DiFerdinan-do), I believe I have come up with some basic rules and regulations that should be observed when as-sessing the validity of one’s sports fandom. 
The following is to be considered the 
ultimate authority on sports allegianc-
es and a reference point for when it is or 
is not acceptable to bust your buddy’s balls for questionable practices.      
ARTICLE I: There are only two no-
ble reasons to claim a sports team (college or professional) as your own:  
a) Regional proximity 
b) Family ties
If you are from a city, or are 
choosing a nearby team to root for, you’re well within the perimeters of logical fandom. If you were raised on a team, or root for a team because that’s what your dad did when you were a little kid, we understand. 
ARTICLE II: All sports allegiances 
must be formed before the teenage years. And once formed, only un-der a precious few circumstances is it OK to jump to another team. 
Pro Teams: If you chose to root 
for the Buffalo Bills when you were a wee lad because you liked the team’s jerseys, this is a Level 1 Of-
fense. I see this as the probation of 
fandom. The fact  that you picked a team at an early age and stuck with it to this day allows you to avoid be ing called out completely, but it puts 
you on extremely thin ice. If I catch 
this same Bills fan ever rooting for another team or claiming to be “not as invested in the Bills” or “starting to like another team more,” he can consider his fandom denied. Under no circumstances is it OK to change allegiances to another pro franchise. This is to be deemed bandwagoning 
or front running, and the guilty par-
ty should be mocked mercilessly. 
The Bailout Exception: A sud-
denly enlightened fan may jump ship from a once-likeable team that has made the switch to a dynastic team that drives everyone insane and represents everything evil in sports. Your new team, however, 
must be downright terrible. I’m 
not talking first-round-playoff-loss bad, I’m talking brunt-of-jokes bad. When done right, this move may be applauded by other card-carrying Fanifesto members. 
College: The collegiate ranks 
are infinitely more complex than the pros. College teams, far more 
than pro teams, really represent a 
fan base. By taking the time to root for a college team, you are making the statement, “See those guys out there, they represent me.” I don’t see it the same way with pro fran-chises. I hold far stronger to the rules outlined in Article I that col-lege teams can only be chosen by 
regional or family ties, though at-
tending a school allows you a legal exception. If you chose a random college team when you were small while not obeying Article I, that team better suck ass, and they bet-ter suck ass every year. They better have a ceiling of “just happy to be in a big game.” They better come 
without expectations.
College programs, for the most 
part, are different than pro teams. 
There’s no up-and-down cycle of who’s good and who isn’t. Power-houses are powerhouses and that’s just how it goes. If you chose to root for FSU, grew up in New York City, moved to South Florida, attend UF 
and have never been to an FSU 
game, that’s a Level 2 Offense and you should be appropriately tor-mented. Furthermore, your charac-ter should be called into question. 
Switches in college sports are also 
very tricky, and I have a bipartisan policy that sees things both ways. If you grew up in South Florida and rooted for Miami because the ‘Canes were the closest regional team, then got accepted to UF and became a Gators fan, that is per-fectly fine. You are always allowed 
to switch to the school you attend, 
even under rivalry circumstances. At the same time, if you grew up in South Florida, rooted for the ‘Canes, Dad took you to games your whole life and you got accepted to UF, you may retain your fandom of the prior school. It’s in your blood, we understand. 
ARTICLE III: Additional college 
rules:
a) You root for an entire college 
program, not individual sports at the school. If you are a Gators fan, you are a Gators fan across the board. You CANNOT root for UF basketball and another school’s 
football team. This is a Level 2 Of-
fense. If you not only split your alle-giance between football and basket-ball, but those two schools happen to be rivals, this is a Level 3 Offense. Let’s just say if someone wanted to terminate your existence, we’d un-derstand — and turn a blind eye.
b) You may have a secondary 
college team under the following circumstances:
It’s not your fault if you go to a 
school with a smaller sports pro-gram, and it’s not your fault if you go to a powerhouse school that never gets to experience the magic of coming out of nowhere and “shocking the world.” It is for this 
reason I will allow college fans to 
have two teams if they meet the fol-lowing conditions: 
i) One of the schools is in a BCS 
conference, and the other is not.
ii) Your No. 1 school is clearly 
defined.
If you attend the small schools 
of the world, your big school must 
be chosen based on the noble rea-
sons already outlined. I don’t want to hear about liberal arts students in the Northeast cheering for USC. If you attend the powerhouses of the world, your small school can be chosen under any conditions you like, but you must do the follow-ing: 
i) Follow the team. Know the 
team. Act as if you were a student there, and make sure your knowl-edge is on the same level.
ii) Don’t treat them as the flavor 
of the week. For someone like my-self, who loves mid-major basket-ball, it is very tempting to fall for each new Cinderella on a year-to-
year basis. It is important not to be 
swept up in switching from George Mason to St. Mary’s to Davidson. Be faithful. 
The “Major” Clause: In basket-
ball, the BCS conference rule is just a general outline. Do some research in finding a complete list of what are considered MAJOR programs, 
as you can only have one of these. 
For example: Memphis, Xavier and Gonzaga (along with a few others I’m likely forgetting) are not to be looked at as small schools simply because they are not in BCS con-
ferences. You may not be a fan of a 
BCS school and one of those three schools.
The God Clause:  I dislike this 
rule, but I’ve been told by a gaggle (more than a few, less than a myri-ad) of peers that it is legitimate and to be observed. If you are Catholic, you may claim Notre Dame as a 
second team. I don’t like it, but I’ll 
respect it. By the same standards, I think BYU should be seen as fair game for any Mormon fans. 
ARTICLE IV: Wearing a team’s 
gear is not to be seen as a declara-tion of fanhood. 
Wearing a team’s clothes does not make you a qualified fan of that team. And just because you are a fan of one team, that does not nec-
essarily exclude you from wearing 
other teams’ gear. Jerseys or player-specific sportswear are especially appropriate in this case. You may absolutely like players on other teams and wear their jerseys as a result. Some teams just have sweet colors that match an outfit. This is another legal move. 
The LeBron Clause: If caught 
wearing another team’s shirt/hat, and asked about it (Oh, you’re a Yankees fan?), you must immedi-ately set them straight, say you only like the shirt/hat and declare your actual team of preference. IMPOR-

MY teams
Primary Team: New York Mets 
Secondary Team: Florida Marlins
My father was nice enough to curse me with the Mets, and I grew up 45 minutes north of where the Marlins play.
Primary Team: Miami Heat 
The Heat have been perhaps my most 
enjoyable regional team, blessing me with the only professional sports title won by one of my American primary teams during my lifetime. 
Primary Team: Miami Dolphins 
The Dolphins have been a heart-breaking regional selection.
Primary Team: Florida Panthers
Be sure to do as I do and pick up your 
local NHL squad come playoff time. 
Primary Team: Miami Hurricanes to Florida Gators to None
I was a Miami fan growing up but became a Gators fan when I enrolled at UF. Now that I’m a sports journalist (kind of), I’ve worked hard to pretty much strip myself of college fanhood.
Secondary Team: Dayton Flyers
For college basketball, I officially claim 
Dayton as my small school team of choice. 
Primary Team: ArsenalSecondary Team: Lyon
I’ve adopted Arsenal from the EPL (although I’ll admit to being a half-assed fan lately) and Lyon (a French league team) as my second team.

TANT: You may NEVER, EVER, EVER wear 
the gear of a rival, even under the player-spe-cific provision. 
The College Loyalty Exception: A player 
from your college team was drafted by a rival 
of your favorite pro team. This is a terrible co-
nundrum for any fan, we understand. 
ARTICLE V: Rooting for a team is different 
than being a fan of a team. 
There are plenty of teams I like. I root for 
them openly and wish them well. This is a perfectly legal move as long as you never blur the line of being a fan of that team. 
The Game Theory Clause: You may not 
root for a team that you “just like” if it will have a negative consequence on your own team. By the same token, you may root for rivals or otherwise despised teams if the out-come will benefit your team. 
The Everyone Loses Clause: If you are a 
true sports fan, you may find yourself in situ-ations where you are watching a game, yet 
not rooting for anyone. When the Yankees 
play the Red Sox in the playoffs, rooting for a stadium-wide swine flu outbreak may be seen as cruel, but perfectly acceptable under the Fanifesto. 
ARTICLE VI: Smack talk is usually OK, but it 
is a practice to be handled with care. 
Everyone loves poking fun at a friend’s 
latest sports disaster. It brings a smile to our face that your team just flamed out in the worst way imaginable. Smack talking a fallen friend is to be treated much like smack talk-ing an eccentric public figure who has passed away. If you make a joke too soon, you will be viewed as classless. And if you take offense on behalf of your team too easily, you should be viewed as a whiny, perspective-less sports fan.The Equal Footing Clause: If you are 
smack talking a friend’s team beyond a quick good-natured remark, your team must be at 
least on equal standing with your friend’s 
team, and preferably in better standing. For an FSU fan, the only thing worse than being made fun of by a UF fan (whose team is enjoy-ing unprecedented success) is being made fun of by a Miami fan. The Seminoles may be get-ting whooped on by the Gators year after year, but the ‘Canes aren’t exactly in better shape. 
The Gentlemen’s Clause: Know which 
teams your friends are most emotionally in-vested in and act accordingly. Explore the boundaries, but try not to cross them. A “con-gratulations” to friends when their team does well is a classy move and earns you bonus points in my book.
ARTICLE VII: How to handle the soccer 
phenomenon:
Somehow, while you were asleep, soccer 
has made a serious movement in this country. Most of us Americans didn’t grow up with the sport and have found it later in life. The best soccer in the world is played overseas, and picking European teams to follow is ex-tremely difficult (ask ESPN’s Bill Simmons). 
The English Premier League is exactly 
that, the premier soccer league in the world. 
I frequently compare European soccer to col-
lege football due to the intense fan worship, and the different leagues compare favor-ably to college conferences. The EPL is the Southeastern Conference of European soccer. Everyone who wants to follow soccer across the pond needs to pick an EPL team; unfor-tunately, there are really only four legitimate choices. 
Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Man-
chester United are by far the cream of the crop and the only teams that have a shot at winning the league year-in and year-out. Unfortunately for you, prospective soccer fan, Chelsea and Man U have to be thrown out right away as choices because they are the Red Sox and Yankees (or USC and UF) of soccer and cannot be adopted by Americans 
looking to attach some importance to their 
newfound sport. Arsenal and Liverpool are fine choices, and I recommend one of those two teams. If you think you can handle fol-lowing a frustrating, slightly lower-level team that doesn’t have as good of a chance to win, then Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur, As-ton Villa and Everton are all solid choices. In addition to your EPL team, you may choose 
one other team from all the other leagues 
combined to root for when it comes time for Champions League play. However, be sure to designate which of the two teams is your No. 1 so your allegiances are clear if the two are ever to meet. 
The Inferior League Clause: The MLS is a 
joke of a league no matter what Mike McCall tells you. I don’t really want to get into choos-
ing an MLS team. Pick whoever you want ex-
cept for the Los Angeles Galaxy. 
ARTICLE VIII: Addressing the international 
conflict:
I had the opportunity to add to my ever-
expanding list of cool sporting events I’ve been to this spring when a few of my friends and I went to see a World Baseball Classic 
game in the aforementioned Land Shark Sta-
dium. Puerto Rico was playing the United States, and I can vouch for the 5:1 ratio of Puerto Rican fans to American fans. I’m sure many of them can legitimately root for Puerto Rico under the rules I’m about to outline, but I assure you many of them cannot.
a) Your international fanhood lies simply 
with your citizenship. You don’t have to be 
born in the United States to be a citizen, but 
you damn sure have to have been natural-ized. Similarly, you don’t have to be born in Puerto Rico to be a fan, but you damn sure have to have been naturalized. (I understand that Puerto Ricans have American citizen-ship, but stay with me.) Any country that you have citizenship in, you can claim. If you have dual citizenship, you may claim two 
countries. If you don’t, you can’t. If you are 
an American by citizenship, you should be a fan of the United States. 
b)  This does not follow the rules outlined 
in Article I for picking a professional or col-legiate team. Family ties do not count for this one. Half of my family is French, and my fa-ther was born in France and flaunts his fan-hood for the other Red, White and Blue any 
chance he gets, but that doesn’t mean that I’m 
allowed to. I root for France as a second team, but I can’t claim fanhood of that team.

Tebow’s speech, play sparks team’s title run By ADAM BERRY

 Stacey Nelson did not receive 
the national recognition Tim Tebow 
did, but she may have been better at her sport than any other athlete in 
Gainesville.
Her relaxed, humble attitude off 
the ﬁ  eld was matched only by her 
intensity and dominance once she stepped into the circle. With 41 wins on the year, Nelson led the Gators to a 63-5 record, a No. 1 ranking for most of the season and a Women’s College World Series ﬁ  nals appear-
ance against Washingon where the 
Gators fell just short. 
Coach Tim Walton said she, 
along with senior Kim Waleszonia, 
will be honored even after their four 
outstanding years on the ﬁ  eld.
“As long as I coach here, you 
won’t ever see a No. 5 (Waleszonia), you won’t ever see a No. 42 (Nelson) on anybody else’s back,” Walton said. “We don’t really retire num-bers, but they won’t be worn as long as I’m the coach here at the Univer-sity of Florida.”
She became the ﬁ  rst Gator to 
strike out 1,000 batters, threw two no-hitters and holds nearly every UF pitching record.
Even the list of accolades Nelson 
earned during and after her ﬁ  nal season is remarkable. In addition to the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award, she was a top-three ﬁ  nalist for the USA Softball Collegiate  Player of 
the Year, earned ﬁ  rst-team All-America honors from two dif-
ferent organizations 
and, was selected as one of ﬁ  ve pitchers on the USA Softball 
Women’s National Team. 
For dominating the competition 
throughout the season and during her entire career, Stacey Nelson is the alligatorSports No. 2 UF Athlete 
of 2008-09.
BY THE NUMBERS: Nelson is the 
second athlete to receive a vote from all six panelists. She received four second-place votes, one third-
place vote and one fourth-place 
vote.

 In 107 words, Tim Tebow went 
from hyped hero to living legend.
”To the fans and everybody in Gator 
Nation, I’m sorry. I’m extremely sorry. 
We were hoping for an undefeated 
season. That was my goal, something Florida has never done here.
“I promise you one thing — a lot 
of good will come out of this. You will never see any player in the entire coun-
try play as hard as I will play the rest 
of the season. You will never see some-one push the rest of his team as hard 
as I will push everybody the rest of the 
season. You will never see a team play harder than we will the rest of the sea-
son.
“God bless.”
Tebow has made plenty of big 
plays — most notably his fourth-and-1 conversion at Tennessee in 2006 and his entire record-setting 
Heisman-winning campaign of 
2007 — but now he had failed in the unlikeliest of moments.
The Gators had been upset. At 
home. Against an unranked Missis-sippi team. 
Having failed on a ﬁ  nal fourth-
and-1, the spot where Tebow had been seen as automatic.
But when he looked at his worst, he was actually at his best. His 
words became a rallying cry for 
teammates and fans.
These words would have rung 
hollow had the Gators not respond-ed the way they did. 
UF won its remaining 10 games 
by double digits, including eight by 28 points or more.
And this is why Tebow was 
unanimously picked as our top UF athlete for last year.
In his junior season, he ran a 
proliﬁ  c offense that averaged 43.6 
points per game while once again 
leading the Gators in 
passing and rushing yards and totaling 42 
touchdowns. 
Tebow fell short in his quest for 
a second straight Heisman Trophy, ﬁ  nishing third, but earned more 
ﬁ  rst-place votes than winner Sam Bradford and runner-up Colt Mc-
Coy.
He was at his best during the 
team’s two biggest games.
The Jacksonville native earned 
BCS Most Outstanding Offensive 
Player honors after throwing for 
231 yards and two touchdowns and 
adding 109 yards on the ground.
This came a month after Tebow 
earned Southeastern Conference Championship MVP honors go-ing 14 of 22 with 216 passing yards 
and 57 rushing yards, including 
a 5-yard touchdown pass to Riley Cooper on a slant that sealed the 
game with 2:50 remaining.
“I’ve had some great players, 
and I’ve got some great players on this team,” UF coach Urban Meyer 
said after the game. “But I’ve never had one like this. Tim’s got some-
thing special inside him. I’m not 
talking about throwing. 
“I’m not talking about running. 
I’m talking about making every-one around him better. That fourth quarter was vintage Tim Tebow.”
He made an otherwise boring 
national championship celebration inside The Swamp immediately 
newsworthy with his drawn-out, 
climactic announcement:
“...Oh and by the way, one more 
thing — let’s do it again. I’m com-ing back!”
After living up to this year’s 
promise, it’s hard to doubt his next one.
For his near-miraculous leader-
ship in leading the Gators to their second national championship in three years while solidifying his 
place as one of the best college foot-
ball players of all time, Tim Tebow is the alligatorSports No. 1 UF Ath-
lete of 2008-09.

UF defensive tackle Jaye Howard (6) hopes to have more of an impact 
after playing only sparingly last year. He had 1.5 sacks in nine games. 
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligator.org
UF relied heavily on a ro-
tation of players at defensive 
tackle to create penetration up 
the middle a year ago, but with 
Torrey Davis and John Brown off the team and Matt Patchan switching to the offensive line, 
the Gators needed someone to 
step up this fall to fill out the rotation.
Although Jaye Howard is 
still listed as a defensive end, 
he has been making noise in-
side, pushing starters Terron Sanders and Lawrence Marsh for playing time.
“What we always said about 
that position is we need to es-tablish depth at the position, because if you look at it, Marsh and Sanders pretty much played 
they whole year last year,” UF 
defensive coordinator Charlie Strong said. 
The transition from defen-
sive end to the inside has been a long process for Howard.
Last year, he saw limited 
time at defensive tackle, record-ing only eight tackles with just 
1.5 sacks.His lack of playing time was 
a result of his poor run defense, 
which only allowed him to see the field in passing situations, 
something he worked on in 
the offseason with the help of  Marsh.
“During the summer time, 
I hit the sled hard on my own and with Marsh (to improve my run defense), and he would push me in our workouts,” Howard said.
Getting better at stopping 
the inside run wasn’t just about working hard on the field. It required hard work at meal 
times.
Howard gained more than 
25 pounds since last season — 
bringing him up to 296 — to be 
better suited to handle the strain 
of going up against 300-pound guards and centers.
While the weight gain was in order to get him on the field and stop him from getting em-
barrassed by the Pounceys in 
practice, Howard had to make sure not to lose the quickness he had when he was 270 pounds, 
which hasn’t been a problem 
for him.
“At first last year, when I 
started playing (defensive tack-le) in the fall, I was 270 and I 
was getting blown up every 
time,” he said. “Now, I am up to 295 and I am moving quick-er. 
“I am agile and I can move 
better than all the guards, so it’s easy right now.”
After waiting two years to 
get to the point where he has 
earned significant playing time, 
Howard is ready to make the most of the his opportunity. Defensive line coach Dan Mc-
Carney showed last year his 
desire to have a deep rotation.
But Howard knows with the 
talent behind him, slacking off could drop him in the depth 
chart and out of the playing 
time he has waited for.
“You have to bring your ‘A’ 
game every day, because prac-tice is basically a game and it determines your role on the 
team,” he said. “(One bad day) 
can really put you behind.”Howard bulks up, moves inside

 During his three seasons at UF, 
Tim Tebow has won, in chronologi-
cal order, a national championship, a Heisman Trophy and another nation-
al championship.
Last year, Tebow ﬁ  nished third in 
the Heisman voting behind winner 
Sam Bradford and runner-up Colt McCoy despite receiving the most ﬁ  rst- and third-place votes. In 2009, those three quarterbacks will once again battle it out.
So the question is: Will Tebow be-
come the second player ever to win more than one Heisman Trophy?
Considering the fact Tebow and 
Bradford have already won one each, voters may be swayed to put McCoy atop their ballots rather than let one of the two previous winners join Archie Grifﬁ  n as the only players with two Heisman Trophies.
If the argument is boiled down 
to statistical success, Tebow may not have the strongest case. First, it’s likely the Gators will open up such a big lead on many opponents that the ﬁ  rst-string offense won’t even play the fourth quarter. Second, UF will look to spread the ball around and in-volve many of its other weapons on 
offense. Finally, the ridiculous num-
bers Tebow put up in 2007 may have hurt him last year and could do the same this year, as matching up to his unbelievable Heisman campaign is nearly impossible.
Granted, Tebow will likely lead the 
Gators in rushing, as he has done the past two years. Although his passing 
numbers may not be as impressive 
as they were with Percy Harvin and Louis Murphy at receiver, they will still compare favorably to McCoy’s. 
If voters favor the best player on 
the best team, then he could very well lead the pack. The Gators are, at this point, the front-runners to win the 
national title, and if 
they make it, Tebow 
will be the one to lead them there.
Two more impor-
tant issues will weigh on Tebow’s mind this 
season. 
In his last season at UF with his 
NFL future looming in the distance, 
he will likely be looking to become a 
more complete, all-around quarter-back. And as selﬂ  ess and team-ori-ented as he has proven himself to be, he will primarily focus on leading his team to an undefeated season and an-other national championship, cement-ing his already-impressive legacy.
With that in mind, perhaps the 
two more interesting questions re-garding Tebow will not be answered during the course of the season. Can he become a more NFL-ready quar-terback? And will he be remembered as the greatest player in college foot-ball history? Can Tebow win 2nd Heisman?

 From the time confetti was falling on 
Dolphin Stadium, people started talking about the 2009 UF football team.
The Gators had just won their second 
national championship in three years, with a pretty young team to boot.
By the time Tim Tebow announced 
he was coming back (and was joined by Brandon Spikes), college football experts began discussing it.
The question is one that has already 
been asked a thousand times: Can the UF football team repeat as national 
champions?
There is certainly little doubt sur-
rounding the consensus preseason pick 
for national champion.
The four major preseason magazines 
already released — Phil Steele, Lindy’s, Athlon and Sporting News — all peg the Gators as No. 1. They have been installed as 2-1 favorites by sportsbooks, accord-
ing to VegasInsider.com. 
At SEC Media Days, UF was the ﬁ  rst 
unanimous selection to win its division 
since the league split into East and West in 1992. The Gators also earned 63 of 64 media votes to be predicted as overall SEC champion.
As has been mentioned before, UF 
returns its entire two-deep on defense. 
Tebow is set to go down as one of the 
best college quarterbacks ever, and Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey showed they can be home-run threats on any carry.
The offensive line loses two starters 
(Jason Watkins and Phil Trautwein) but has sophomore Matt Patchan switch-ing back to the O-line, and Sam Robey showed he could start at center with a breakout spring.
It should be noted this is a perilous 
journey. There has not been an undis-puted repeat champion since Nebraska did it in 1994-95.
Teams can become complacent and 
expect to roll over opponents. Certainly 
UF’s experience and leadership from 
Tebow and Spikes will help ﬁ  ght that.
The Gators tumbled after winning 
the crystal ball in 2006 and ﬁ  nished 9-4 in 2007 with a disappointing 41-35 loss to Michigan in the Capital One Bowl. But that 2007 team was much different from the year prior — this time, the 2009 team looks an awful like 2008, only with 
another year more expe-rience.
Besides complacency, 
the biggest factor will be the departure of Percy Harvin to the NFL Draft and the inexperienced 
receiving corps.
But even that can’t stop the excite-
ment from fans and analysts alike.
In fact, some people have Tebow 
holding a crystal ball in Pasadena as such a sure thing that they started wondering if UF will lose any games at all.
The Vince Young-led 2005 Texas 
team was the last undefeated national champion.
Lost in the midst of last year’s now-
famous The Promise, Tebow let it slip that an undefeated season was the goal — last year.
“We were hoping for an undefeated 
season. That was my goal, something Florida has never done here.”
Was he just a year off?Only time will tell. Will UF football team repeat? Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff

UF coach Urban Meyer has 
called Joe Haden one of the top five athletes he has ever 
coached.
Tight end Aaron Hernandez told re-
porters at UF’s media day that Haden, 
Carl Moore and himself took down Er-
ving Walker, Ray Shipman and Vernon Macklin in three-on-three basketball. 
I also heard from an onlooker that 
Haden looked like the best player on the court. 
The junior cornerback can do it all, 
which is why Meyer has decided that putting Haden in as the Wildcat quar-
terback is a good idea. 
When he used Percy Harvin in that 
role in the past, defenses knew he was 
going to run the ball because the Min-nesota Vikings’ first-round draft pick wasn’t much of a thrower. 
Haden was a quarterback in high 
school, and a damn good one. 
That doesn’t mean Haden is going to 
sit in the pocket and throw the ball from sideline to sideline. I’m sure Meyer will use him primarily to run the ball as well, but don’t be surprised to see Haden roll out to his right side and drop in a short pass or two. 
Chas Henry, 
on the other hand, is a punt-er. A fine punt-
er, but a punter 
nonetheless. 
He will 
probably see no playing time within the of-fense, and Mike 
knows that. 
His argument comes completely on 
the belief, or delusion, that Henry will throw a touchdown on a fake punt try.
Think about how many things have 
to go right for that to happen. 
If Henry is on the field to punt, that 
means that the Gators are no closer to their opponent’s end zone than about 35 yards. 
So, Meyer will have to first call for a 
fake, Henry will have to complete a pass and then the play must work so well that it is able to gain at least 35 yards.
Henry was also a pretty solid quarter-
back in high school, but circumstances make Haden the obvious choice as more likely to toss a TD pass this season. Who is more likely to throw a TD pass this season: Haden or Henry?
Don’t let Urban Meyer and Kyle 
Mastri fool you into thinking Joe Haden will be spending 
any real time on offense this season. 
Haden might have been an accom-
plished high school quarterback, but 
is Meyer really going to let a defensive 
back take meaningful snaps while his Heisman Trophy-winner sits on the bench? 
Do you really want to take the ball 
out of the hands of arguably the great-est college football player of all time?  I don’t think so.
All Meyer is doing is throwing out a 
smoke screen. He’s just giving opppo-nets one more thing to think about.
If Haden does somehow manage to 
make it under center, don’t expect him to be airing it out. Meyer isn’t going to gamble an undefeated season on the arm of a cornerback. At best, Haden gets to come in and run a few option plays.
But even that’s unlikely. The Gators 
have far too much to lose by letting Ha-den run around for two or three gim-micky plays every game. 
What happens if he gets hurt carry-
ing the ball and UF has to go without its All-Southeast-ern Conference corner the rest of the season?
Forget Ha-
den. The off-the-radar guy who could be throwing a touchdown pass this sea-son is punter Chas Henry.
Henry threw for more than 1,700 
yards and 17 touchdowns his senior year at  Dallas (Ga.) East Paulding High.
Henry has an exceptional arm for a 
punter, which makes him a real threat for a fake punt.
He has already thrown a pass in his 
UF career, a 15-yard fake punt conver-sion to tight end Aaron Hernandez against Michigan two seasons ago, and 
Meyer has been known to roll the dice 
with a fake in the right situation. He’s 6 for 6 on fake punts as the head coach at UF.
Don’t be shocked to see Henry pick 
up a big first down or even a touchdown when the Gators really need it this year.
