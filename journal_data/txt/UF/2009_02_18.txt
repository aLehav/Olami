STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Students passing through Turlington 
Plaza Tuesday afternoon may have heard 
something a little different than ranting 
preachers.For the past two days, the Independent 
Florida Alligator and the College Repub-licans hosted a series of debates allowing each office represented on the executive ticket — president, vice president and 
treasurer — to discuss platform issues and 
campus improvements. Although the Orange and Blue Party, 
the Progress Party and the Unite Party all participated, Keg Party members were ab-sent due to class conflicts.
Kate Rapp, a member of College Repub-
licans, who moderated the debate, asked the three candidates specific questions about the Student Government Cabinet, 
which the vice president oversees.
Although candidates argued about most 
issues, they did finally agree that most are 
unaware of the Cabinet’s existence. SG Veep candidates debate on UF campus

Feet tap to the rhythm of 
drums, and heads bob in sync 
with reggae beats that blare 
over the speakers. The dimly lit room is alive with anticipa-tion and the excited chatter of a house that is packed before 
the show even begins. 
Stomp, a show that offers a 
unique medley of percussion, 
movement and comedy, held 
its first performance in front 
of a sold-out audience Tues-day night at the Phillips Cen-ter for the Performing Arts. 
Only a few tickets remain 
for the last showing, which will be held today at 7:30 p.m. 
The show, which began in 
the United Kingdom in the summer of 1991, has been touring in North America for 15 years. 
“It brings the community 
together in a way few other things can,” said Michael 
Blachly, director of UF Per-
forming Arts. “It doesn’t mat-ter if you’re 8 or 80.” 
Blachly said he has pre-
sented the show more than 100 times in 15 years every-where from Los Angeles to Gainesville, and each time it 
has sold out. 
“It’s full of energy, emo-
tion; it’s incredibly creative 
and never is a word spoken,” he said. 
Blachly could not disclose 
how much the production cost to bring to the university.

� THE  MAN WAS FOUND AT 
WAL-MART WITH SIX CANS OF KEYBOARD CLEANER.
A Gainesville man was arrest-
ed for petit theft after he was ac-
cused of taking six cans of a com-
puter keyboard-cleaning product 
into a Wal-Mart bathroom.Gainesville police arrived at 
the Wal-Mart on Northwest 13th Street Sunday after a sales asso-ciate informed them of the man’s 
suspicious behavior.
Officers found Dustin Martin, 
23, in the bathroom after he had 
inhaled five out of the six cans 
of the computer-cleaning prod-uct, said GPD spokesman Keith 
Kameg.
Martin was taken 
to Shands at AGH 
for treatment fol-
lowing the incident.
Kameg said that 
this is not the first run-in GPD 
has had with Martin.GPD has been called on nu-
merous occasions when Martin 
was stealing cans or had already “huffed” them and passed out 
from the act, Kameg said.
Earlier this month, Kameg 
said Martin was found passed 
out near Bonefish Grill on South-
west Archer Road.“We have a very good sense of 
how this case is going to end, and 
it is going to be poorly,” Kameg said. 
“If these addictions don’t get 
under control, the chemicals in this product are probably going to kill him.”

Officials: Obama OKs more Afghanistan troops
WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense and congres-
sional officials say President Barack Obama has ap-
proved an increase in U.S. forces for the flagging war in Afghanistan, sending one additional Army brigade and some Marines this spring. One official said the total is about 17,000 troops.
That would be the first installment on an influx 
of U.S. forces that have been expected this year. It would get a few thousand troops in place in time for the increase in fighting that usually comes with warmer weather and ahead of national elections.SEE DEBATE, p AGE 8

n HE SAID HE TOOK DRUGS 
FOR AN ENERGY BOOST.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Alex Rodri-
guez offered new details Tuesday 
about his performance-enhancing 
drug use, saying his cousin injected 
him with an over-the-counter sub-stance to gain an energy boost. The New York Yankees star said using 
the banned drug that he said he ob-
tained from the Dominican Repub-lic was a “stupid mistake.”
“I knew we weren’t taking Tic 
Tacs,” said Rodriguez, who was 
joined at the head table with Yan-
kees general manager Brian Cash-man and manager Joe Girardi.The three-time AL MVP and 
baseball’s highest-paid player met the media 10 days after Sports Illus-
trated reported that he tested posi-
tive in 2003.
In an interview with ESPN last 
week, Rodriguez admitted to using 
banned drugs from 
2001 to 2003 while 
playing for the Texas Rangers. He 
insisted then and 
again Tuesday that he has not used 
banned drugs since.
“I’m here to take my medicine,” 
Rodriguez said. “One thing I will say after today: I hope to focus on baseball. We have a very special team here.”

Stetson Kennedy is donat-

James Schmidt, co-coor-
dinator of the Civic Media Center, said 93-year-old Kennedy would donate more than 1,000 books to 
the center by early to mid 
March.
“This is a tremendous 
honor for us,” Schmidt said. 
Born and raised in Fruit 
Cove, near Jacksonville, Kennedy made his living as a folklorist and writer.
Kennedy traveled Florida 
collecting stories, songs and tall tales on the culture of various groups in the state, Schmidt said. 
“Kennedy is one of my 
idols,” he said. “He is sharp as a tack, has a brilliant mind, is an easygoing man and an all-around great hu-
man being.” 
Schmidt and a few CMC 
collections committee mem-
bers plan to visit Kennedy and his wife, Sandra Parks, in St. Augustine soon. The group will spend the week-end with Kennedy and 
Parks to sort out the books, 
Schmidt said. The ones that are not 
taken for the CMC will ei-ther go to Anastasia Books, 
Parks’ bookstore in St. Au-
gustine, or to Kennedy’s old house in Beluthahatchee, a national literary landmark.
Kennedy will be at the 
Civic Media Center’s grand reopening ceremony Sat-urday  signing copies of his 1942 book “Klan Un-
masked,” a nonfiction book 
that tells stories about how Kennedy infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in Florida and 
Georgia and exposed secret 
code words and prominent figures’ names over the Su-perman Radio Program.
“Stetson was a staunch 
white ally to the African-American freedom strug-gle,” Schmidt said. “He is a 
living link to a past that is 
rapidly disappearing.”Author gives books to CMC A-Rod apologizes

Dr. Amanda House, a large-animal internal medicine specialist at the University of Florida College of 
Veterinary Medicine, comes face to face with a foal in UF’s Equine Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
LOCAL
By YVONNE AYALA
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
When Ocala resident Irene Bry-
an first purchased Skippa Secret, 
she knew the mare had a surprise 
in store. 
The 2-and-a-half year-old Ap-
paloosa mare gave birth to Sarah’s 
Secret Noel prematurely near the first of the year. 
Bryan purchased the mare in 
December as a present for her granddaughter, Sarah Konemann, 10.
“The foal was just icing on the 
cake,” Bryan said.
No one knew when Sarah’s Se-
cret Noel would be born, and the pair was rushed to UF’s Veterinary Medical Center for treatment.
“Skippa Secret’s foal was 
brought to the veterinary hospi-tal almost immediately,” said Dr. 
Amanda House, an assistant pro-
fessor of veterinary medicine at UF. “It enabled us to give her every opportunity treatment-wise for her to make a complete and full recov-ery.”
The foal and her mother were 
hospitalized for about 10 days at the Hofmann Equine Neonatal In-
tensive Care Unit and the foal was 
treated for prematurity; not getting enough colostrum, or first milk, af-ter birth; and septicemia, a bacterial infection of the blood, House said.
Bryan was a little overwhelmed 
by the animal hospital experience. 
“When we got there, they had 
gurneys out there and everything like somebody was coming to the hospital—like a human being was 
coming,” Bryan said. “It was im-
pressive.”
 The facility is one of the most 
advanced neonatal  intensive care units for horses in the world and the only comprehensive unit in Florida, said Dana Zimmel, chief of Large Animal Internal Medicine Services at UF.
The discipline at UF began in 
the 1980s as a partnership between veterinary faculty specialists and human neonatologists at the UF Health Science Center. The unit now offers 24-hour emergency ser-vice year-round.
The ENICU treats all breeds of 
mares and foals and usually admits 
100 to 150 foals each season, which 
typically runs from December to June.
The mare and her foal are  re-
covering at home.
The experience was memorable 
for Bryan’s granddaughter Sarah,   who says she wants to be a large-animal veterinarian. 
“The baby is just adorable and 
just wants to be with people more than anything else,” Bryan said.Premature foal saved by UF’s Veterinary Hospital
� ALUMNI WERE AMONG THREE 
TEAMS SELECTED FROM 713.

Two UF alumni were awarded a Stu-
dent Emmy for their thesis documentary, 
making it the third consecutive win for 
UF’s Documentary Institute. 
Chris Brannan and David Randag, 
graduates of the institute, were one of three groups awarded Emmys last week.
The documentary, “Standard Devia-tion,” is about Billy Cottrell, a genius from Gainesville who was sentenced to eight years in jail on terrorism charges after set-ting fire to a Hummer dealership in Cali-fornia. 
Out of 713 entries, Brannan and Randag 
were among three teams selected by the members of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation to receive 
the award, said Debbie Slavkin, academy 
program manager. The other two teams were from the University of California, Berkeley. 
The documentaries will be ranked first, second and third on March 21 at the 30th College Television Awards presented by the academy.
Since their graduation in 2008, the film-
makers have not stopped showing their 
film at festivals across the country, Randag 
said.
The documentary won in 
the student category at the 2008 Fort Lauderdale Interna-
tional Film Festival and in the short films 
category the 2008 Daytona Beach Film Fes-tival.
It was also selected to be shown at the San Francisco Documentary Festival, ac-cording to the documentary’s Web site. 
With support from the Documentary 
Institute and a budget of about $5,500, the filmmakers were able to acquire material, 
interview sources in various cities includ-
ing Chicago and Seattle and see Cottrell himself, Randag said.
The two filmmakers said they are ex-
cited about their win and eager to attend Emmy events, but there is an intimidation factor.

said.UF alumni awarded Student Emmy for documentary

Senators from the Gator Party and the Or-
ange and Blue Party were able to put party 
differences aside and pass a resolution unani-mously opposing Gainesville Charter Amend-ment 1, which would legalize discrimination 
based on gender identity.
Senators and students alike took a stand 
against  the amendment.
“If passed it would make it legal to fire 
[people] from their job, kick them out of their 
house or refuse them service in a restaurant because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,” said Garrett Garner, UF cam-pus coordinator for Equality is Gainesville’s 
Business.
Charter Amendment 1 was added to 
March’s election ballot after a citizen petition, 
which requires the signatures of 10 percent of registered voters, was submitted. 
If passed, the amendment would also affect 
veterans and local businesses. 
“The city of Gainesville can’t extend equal 
rights protection in the future,” he said. 
Garner spoke during the resolution’s pre-sentation alongside its sponsors from both parties.  
A resolution is an official stance the Senate 
takes on an issue. 
“We will speak in one clear voice and show 
that bigotry has no place in Gainesville,” said Ben Cavataro, an author of the bill and Orange 
and Blue Party leader. “It 
will affect the whole univer-sity.” 
Cavataro also said sena-
tors will join Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan, Alachua County Commissioners and the Faculty Senate standing up against the amendment.
Garner encouraged both 
students and senators to vote in city elections, which will be held March 24.
“City politics is what determines a lot about 
our lives at UF,” he said. “There are enough of us here that we can do the right thing.”
Many senators also spoke in favor of a sec-
ond resolution, which is also affecting students of the UF community.
Gator Party Sen. Megan Vu has been work-
ing on the resolution addressing the recent elimination of Vietnamese and Korean pro-grams since last fall and will be presenting it during next week’s Senate meeting on Tues-day. 
Before the programs were cut last June, UF was the only university in the state, public or private, to have these cultural programs.
“This is so much more than a dollar 
amount,” she said. “It’s the culture and diver-sity that UF stands for.”

n FACEBOOK CAN ACCESS 
DELETED ACCOUNTS.
By KATHRYN STOLARZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
Facebook made a quiet change in 
its user contract on Feb. 4, but most 
UF students are not concerned or informed enough to change their posting habits. 
Under the new terms, Facebook 
can now use account content after an account has been deactivated.
Facebook’s Chief Executive and 
founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a post to The Facebook Blog that after deleting an account, content shared with friends will remain ac-cessible through the friends’ pages, just like in an e-mail, which creates two copies of the message once the 
message is sent. Zuckerberg prom-
ised that content would not be used in a way undesirable to users.
Instead of sending a mass notifi-
cation to users, Facebook made an unannounced four-paragraph post to the company blog.
The terms have long spelled 
out the right for  Facebook to use 
posted information and pictures 
for advertising. Jon Mills, a UF law profes-
sor and author of the 2008 book “Privacy: The Lost Right,” said Facebook shouldn’t be allowed to use someone’s picture, identity or information for profit, and stu-dents should protest the fact that Facebook claims rights to do these things.
“I think it really confirms what 
has sort of been happening on Fa-cebook, which is that they can use that information, and people tend 
to forget how public and accessible 
their information becomes,” Mills said.
As Facebook takes more control 
over information on its pages, UF students must decide how much to expose. 
Students Leah Oliveto, Curtis 
Jeffries and Irina Silva expressed 
mild disgust with Facebook, al-
though they said they will continue to use it as they have in the past.
“It was concerning, but I already 
think that anything they put on the Internet they already own,” said Oliveto, a UF marketing senior.
She said since she probably 
won’t become the president of the United States, she isn’t worried about Facebook using her drunken college pictures. 
Silva, a UF biology freshman, 
thinks there is a reason people de-lete accounts.
“I think Facebook should actu-
ally respect our wishes in why we 
decide to deactivate the account,” 
she said.

Plane crash probe 
focuses on crew
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CLARENCE, N.Y. (AP) — The man at the controls of a 
turboprop plane that pitched like a kite before crashing into 
a house last week had spent only 110 hours flying that mod-el, and investigators said Tuesday they would look into the quality and quantity of his training.
The pilot of Continental Connection Flight 3407 apparent-
ly ignored federal recommendations not to fly on autopilot as ice was building on his plane, though investigators so far say he violated no rules.
Whether Capt. Marvin Renslow did all he could to prevent 
potentially disastrous ice buildup or shake it from his plane 
remains to be seen. But experts pointed out Tuesday that he had flown thousands of hours in a similar plane, which would have prepared him for icing on his aircraft.
The actions and even the lives of Renslow, 47, of suburban 
Tampa, Fla., and the first officer, Rebecca Lynne Shaw, 24, of Seattle, are under close scrutiny as the National Transporta-tion Safety Board tries to piece together how a routine flight went fatally wrong in its last 26 seconds.
The NTSB will look into the type of training they received, 
how they performed, how many hours they flew in the seven days before the crash, how much rest they had and what they did in the 72 hours before the accident, said board member Steve Chealander. That includes a look at whether they drank any alcohol or took drugs, a routine question after any crash.Hanrahan

From Fat to Wii Fit
For one fat flamethrow-
er, sheer disgust over his video-game like-
ness led to a life-altering weight loss.
Tipping the scales at a  ro-
bust 270 pounds, San Diego Padres relief pitcher Heath Bell realized that he needed to make some changes after playing a round of Nintendo Wii Fit with his children.
According to an Associat-
ed Press article, Bell suffered 
a bit of embarrassment after 
the game informed him that was clinically obese — which resulted in his Mii avatar fea-turing the characteristics of a grossly overweight man.
Rather than sulk about 
his poor physical health, Bell used the revelation as a mo-
tivating factor to shed the ex-
cess blubber — a resounding 45 pounds in all.
The Editorial Board com-
mends Bell for taking the Wii Fit’s message to heart. Not only will the weight loss help him on the pitching mound, but more important-ly it will add countless years to his life after he hangs up 
his spikes.
We can only imagine this 
giant of a man getting his ex-
ercise groove on   doing the hula hoop simulator while trying not to break the de-vice. Such is a far cry from the typical spring training war stories of players boast-
ing about their new figure 
thanks to pumping iron and overloading on protein.
We’re sure his kids are 
happy now that their dad’s weight loss success story has hit newsstands everywhere.
With all the free publicity 
Nintendo Wii is receiving, 
the young gamers are bound 
to be swimming in free video games in no time.
Maybe next season he 
can credit playing Xbox 360 while on an elliptical.
A series of discreet changes to Facebook’s terms of use 
policy has users concerned about the future of their privacy.
Under the latest modifications, the social networking site 
now holds the rights to all information posted by members, 
even after they delete their accounts. Prior to the change, Fa-
cebook had a license to distribute users’ data as it  saw fit, but forfeited the right once the individual left the site.
Fortunately Facebook does not plan on selling members 
phone numbers’ or email addresses but rather will use the information internally. What this means for the millions of frenzied Facebook followers is that the company can legally use their pictures and data for advertising featured on the site.
The Editorial Board can’t help but wonder about the im-
plications of Facebook’s additions to its terms of use policy. 
Does this mean we should expect to see shirtless photos 
of that hunk from chemistry class hawking Snuggies on the right side of our screens?
If anything, this latest hit to our privacy should serve as a 
wake-up call for our generally lax approach toward sharing information on the Internet available for the whole world to see.
We aren’t suggesting you remove your account or erase 
that line about your affinity for the movie “Funny Games.” The damage is done. If Facebook wants to sell an already-deleted photo of you drunkenly gorging yourself on  Five Star’s cinnamon rolls, there’s nothing stopping them.
Granted, Facebook’s current terms of use policy may not 
be intended to raise capital through the sale of member’s data, but temptation to do so is only a poor financial forecast away.
On Sunday, the “iron man” of Venezuela, Presi-
dent Hugo Chavez, won an electoral coup and passed a referendum removing term limits. He 
will now run the country until he is defeated in an elec-tion — which, if his thuggish manner is any indication, could be a very long time.
Chavez and his supporters make the claim that only 
he can successfully continue the project of converting Venezuela into a socialist state; his opponents claim that he seeks to turn Venezuela into a replica of Cas-tro’s Cuba. For good or ill, the country seems destined to 
move in the direction of a Stalinist “cult of personality.” 
I’ll leave the political judgments to those so inclined — 
instead, what I want to do is give a brief rundown of some of the greatest hits of this controversial and comi-cal figure.
Chavez, always cartoonishly eloquent, is probably 
most widely known for his 2006 outburst about former President George W. Bush during a speech to the U.N. General Assembly. During his speech, the day follow-ing a speech by Bush, Chavez told the assembled digni-taries, “The devil came here yesterday, and it smells of sulfur still today.” The fact that this was met with wild applause is neither here nor there — the fact of that mat-ter is that Chavez, in what can only be described as Paris Hilton-level statesmanship, was willing to go there. 
I always did hear that Venezuelan politics were 
known for their sense of decorum.
Another of my favorite Chavez incidents involves 
his fantastically sexist comments regarding former Sec-retary of State Condoleezza Rice. After Rice called him a “challenge to democracy” in Latin America, Chavez responded by going on his acclaimed weekly talk show (creatively named “Hello President!”) and, addressing Rice, warning her, “Don’t mess with me, girl!” He tied it all together by blowing Condi a kiss, which I’m certain had her blushing. 
Whether this was latent sex-
ism or the political equivalent of playground pigtail pulling, I can’t say. Maybe “El Presi-dente” has a bit of a crush? I always did hear that Venezu-
elan politics were known for stellar sexual harassment 
education.
Finally, there was the incident at the 2007 Ibero-
American summit. Chavez was engaged in a heated (I’m 
beginning to notice a trend) exchange with Spain’s Prime 
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. During the con-
versation he called former Spanish Prime Minister Jose 
Maria Aznar “a fascist” because of his economic policies. He then continued to interrupt the prime minister as he tried to answer. In a fit of frustration, the normally mild-mannered King Juan Carlos I leaned forward and asked Chavez, “Why don’t you shut up?” Chavez did not, in fact, shut up, and the king stood up and left the event. 
I did always hear that Venezuelan politics was known 
for — just forget it. We can probably agree by now that Chavez is wholly lacking in statesman’s graces.
This list of Chavez’s Greatest Hits is by no means ex-
haustive, but it is suggestive of what we have to look forward to. I, for one, am overjoyed at the prospect of watching Venezuela’s firebrand bluster and swagger across the world stage for years to come.

Executive salary cap not fraud solution
Mr. Maple, in your Tuesday column, 
you failed to present evidence other than a 
$500,000 salary cap on executive compen-sation to substantiate your assertion that President Barack Obama will end our mod-
ern era of corporate malfeasance.
Further, I fail to see how the executive 
salary cap even counts as an anti-fraud 
measure, as you fail to even substantiate that claim. How does it dissuade irratio-nal exuberance in derivatives markets, the phenomenon you cite as being a primary symptom of the “Enron-aissance”?
Need I also remind you that at least three 
of Obama’s own Cabinet picks have com-mitted tax evasion, and several, like Tom Daschle and Leon Panetta, are paid lobby-ists (nominated despite Obama’s promise not to utilize them), and several others have had to drop out of the nomination pool for criminal investigations or ethics violations (Gov. Bill Richardson).
Are you honestly counting on a group 
of men and women who can’t even do their own accounting to keep everyone else in this nation honest?
Anthony Ramos
UF alumnus 
n n nObama’s fiscal policies flawed
Jake Miller stated in his Tuesday column 
that “we should view political capital as something more elusive and less ephemeral than the spoils of victory.” It is unfortunate that the Democrats do not agree with him. 
President Barack Obama made his views 
quite clear: “I won,” he stated to Rep. Eric Cantor in a meeting of Congress leaders to discuss the stimulus. “Bipartisanship” for this administration means nothing less than the GOP’s complete surrender and acceptance of terms. Miller stated that “stimulus without spending is technically impossible.” He must be the only person on 
campus who doesn’t understand the con-
cept of a tax cut. 
He then went on to call FDR effective, 
and again, I find we are in agreement. FDR was very effective — at expanding the powers of government over individuals more than any previous time in our history, effective at dulling cutting-edge capitalism, effective at taking Guantanamo (which, to 
Democrats, amounts to nothing less than 
war crimes on Bush’s part) and multiplying it countless times through Executive Order 9066, relocating over 100,000 Japanese in America into internment camps with armed guards and barbed wire. 
Most of all, though, FDR was “effective” 
through his economic stimulus strategy — the same strategy Obama and the Demo-crats have adopted with this massive pork-barrel bill. Just how effective was FDR? 
His Secretary of the Treasury and close 
friend Henry Morgenthau Jr. answered that question. 
“We have tried spending money,” Mor-
genthau said. “We are spending more than we have ever spent before, and it does not work. And I have just one interest, and if 
I am wrong...somebody else can have my 
job. I want to see this country prosperous. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises...I saw after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started...and an enormous debt to boot!” 
The same failed FDR policies make up 
Obama’s platform. Fiscal conservatives know where they stand — it’s right be-tween big government and the people.

Transcript fees not fair
The ways in which our university man-
ages its budget have never made sense to me, but as an undergraduate student striv-ing to continue my education through grad-uate studies and independent research, I 
find one policy even more misguided than most — transcript fees. 
Six dollars may seem inconsequential, 
especially to someone uninterested in ap-
plying for prestigious scholarships, gradu-ate school, study abroad programs, intern-
ships, or permanent employment, but to 
many of us, $6 represents the tip of a Titan-ic-sized iceberg. I understand and support the administration’s endeavors to embrace fiscal responsibility, but why penalize this university’s highest achievers? 
Why should students applying for top 
graduate programs and prestigious schol-arships pay while the less ambitious among 
us slide by tax-free?

Returned wallet proves honesty
Yesterday, I left my wallet on a bus ac-
cidentally. An as of yet anonymous UF stu-
dent found it and turned it over to the driv-er. I caught the bus next time around and got it back from the driver with nothing 
missing. I would like to commend both the 
student and the driver for their honesty.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DETROIT (AP) — General 
Motors and Chrysler asked the 
government for an additional $14 billion in aid, a dramatic ac-knowledgment that conditions 
in the U.S. auto industry have 
grown significantly worse in just two months.
GM presented a survival plan 
that also calls for cutting a total of 47,000 jobs globally and clos-
ing five more U.S. factories. That rep-resents the largest 
work force reduc-
tion announced by a U.S. com-
pany in the economic downturn. Chrysler said it will cut 3,000 more jobs and stop producing three vehicle models.
Meanwhile, the United 
Auto Workers union said it has reached a tentative agreement 
with Chrysler, GM and Ford 
Motor Co. on modifications to labor contracts. Such conces-sions were also a condition of the government bailout.
GM said it could need up to 
$30 billion from the Treasury Department, up from a previ-ous estimate of $18 billion. That 
includes $13.4 billion previously 
allocated and $16.6 billion in new loans. The world’s largest automaker said it could run out of money by March without new funds.Unite Party candidate Lar-
nell Vickers said his past in-
volvement with the Cabinet and knowledge of its workings gave him a leg up on the com-
petition, adding how this dis-
tinguishes him from his two opponents, who are both vet-eran senators.
However, when it came 
time for rebuttals,  Stacey Gray 
of the Orange and Blue Party 
wasted no time to react to Vickers’ comment. 
“He talks about his title but 
has nothing to show for it,” she said. Gray caught the attention of a student passing by.
“(She’s) fiery,” said Freya 
Evangelista, a public relations 
senior. 
Evangelista said she stopped by in between classes 
and found the debate informa-
tive.
“It’s one thing to read their platforms online, but it’s good 
to see how they stand up 
against one another,” she said.
Students interested in hear-ing from candidates running 
for Student Body president 
should stop by Turlington Pla-za today at 1 p.m.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2009
Ana Goni-Lessan / Alligator

debate held on Turlington Plaza on Tuesday afternoon.

minutes without an intermission, captivat-
ed the audience by using ordinary items such as brooms, tin pans, lighters and in-
ner tubes to make complex beats and vi-
sual displays. 
At one point, performers were sus-
pended in the air to play a beat with drum-sticks on the large set hung with a variety of pans, road signs, buckets and fire extin-guishers. 
The audience roared with 
laughter at various points during the show in response to visual comedy and even 
laughed at itself when it couldn’t quite 
keep the beats straight when performers 
encouraged the crowd to clap along. David Gold, who has been a volun-
teer usher at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts for about 20 years, loves how innovative and high-energy the per-
formance is. 
“I’m in it for the free shows,” said Gold, 
who has also seen performers such as Tony 
Bennett and Jerry Seinfeld. 
“I’ve seen a lot of shows, and this is one 
of the best,” he said.Final show will start at 7:30 tonight, few tickets remain

Whether it’s incoming freshmen, junior college transfers 
or reinvented relievers, there’s a whole lot of change in UF’s 
pitching staff this season.
Senior Patrick Keating will provide a steady founda-
tion as the team’s ace and Friday-night starter, and junior 
Billy Bullock, who finished second on the Gators in innings 
pitched a year ago, will remain in the rotation.
But behind them a slew of newcomers will be competing 
for the remaining spots. 
With sophomore Tommy Toledo out for the season after 
undergoing surgery on his right arm and Kyle Mullaney, the opening day starter of a year ago and Stephen Locke no lon-ger with the team, coach Kevin O’Sullivan will rely heavily on freshmen to give UF a chance to be competitive in the 
deep Southeastern Conference.
“The bottom line is you got to pitch to win,” O’Sullivan 
said. “If we’re able to do that, and (we’re) able to catch the 
ball, then you got a chance to win every time you go to the field.”
UF opens the season when Louisville comes to McKethan 
Stadium this weekend, and a pair of left-handed freshmen will get the nod as the Saturday and Sunday starters.
Alex Panteliodis, a 6-foot-2, 240-pound hurler, will start 
the season as the No. 2, and Nick Maronde, who was ranked 19th on Baseball America’s list of the Top 100 high school prospects of 2008, will finish up the series against the Car-dinals.
“Those two guys have earned their opportunity,” 
O’Sullivan said. “Neither of those guys is starting because of who they are. They’ve earned every bit of what they’re getting this weekend.”
Maronde built a close relationship with O’Sullivan dur-
ing the recruiting process when the lefty was a highly-tout-ed prospect out of Lexington, Ky., and O’Sullivan was still with Clemson.
When O’Sullivan made the switch from the Purple and 
Orange to the Orange and Blue, so too did Maronde, who has impressed his teammates and coaches in the early go-ing. 
“We’re lucky to have some guys where the learning 
curve isn’t so steep,” Keating said. “He can be as good as 
anybody.”
Anthony DeSclafani is another freshman who has caught 
Keating’s eye and will be competing for back-of-the-rotation 
starts.
In the bullpen, the Gators will rely on Lake City Com-munity College transfer Jeff Barfield to close out games and junior Tony Davis to set him up. 
Davis, another lefty, led the team in appearances last year 
with 34 but only threw 19.1 innings out of the pen.
O’Sullivan worked with him on changing his delivery 
from the three-quarter arm slot to over the top. 
Davis was used primarily as a lefty specialist last season, 
but with his new delivery, O’Sullivan sees an expanded role for Davis. The over-the-top motion has increased his veloc-ity and makes it harder for right-handed hitters to pick up the ball.
“He’s one of those guys you pull for because he’s put 
in the work,” O’Sullivan said. “Every time you’ve doubted 
him or said he may not pitch much here at Florida, he’s 
proven you wrong, so those are the stories that make you feel good.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2009

� SHE SAID JOHNSON “DATE 
RAPED” HER THREE TIMES.
By BRIAN STEELE
Alligator Staff Writer
bsteele@alligator.org
An ex-girlfriend of UF offensive lineman 
Carl Johnson wrote in a petition to obtain 
a sexual violence restraining order that he “date raped” her three separate times from September to November, according to court documents. Johnson was arrested Monday on charges of violating that restraining order. 
The ex-girlfriend, who submitted the re-
quest on Feb. 9, wrote that she was in a violent relationship with Johnson from July to De-
cember, and there was “regular” physical and 
emotional abuse throughout. Johnson would shake her, bite her and hit her, according to the restraining order. Johnson, however, would say that it was “play fighting,” the woman wrote in the document.
She also said that throughout the relation-
ship, Johnson said his “number one goal in life before he dies is to shoot and kill someone,” according to the petition.
Toward the end of the relationship, she 
told Johnson’s parents of the alleged rapes and “everything he had done to me.” When 
Johnson found out she told his parents about 
these allegations, he told her he was going to “go upstairs and get his gun,” according to the document.
When she told him he would go to jail for 
this behavior, he said, “I don’t care. … At least it would be for something good,” according to the document.“Throughout our relationship, he also 
made it very clear he is not afraid to put his hands on a woman,” the woman continued. “His physical size is not only intimidating, as he is 6’7 and 350 lbs., but his status on the foot-
ball team at UF is too.”
Johnson was released from jail Tuesday 
morning and is not currently facing any crimi-
nal charges. He and the woman will be in court Tuesday for a hearing.
Coach Urban Meyer is still out of the coun-
try and has not yet commented on these ac-cusations.UF prepares for meet against SEC powerhouse Alabama
Ex-girlfriend accuses Johnson of date rape in restraining orderBy EuGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
The Southeastern Conference is 
more than just a football league. It has also been a hotbed for gymnas-
tics.
No. 6 UF, coming off its first road 
win of the season, hosts No. 8 Ala-
bama on Friday in a matchup of SEC gymnastics powerhouses. 
The Gators (4-2, 2-2 SEC) should be riding the momentum from their last meet, when they notched their season-high score of 196.85.
The two schools have a long his-
tory — this is the 22nd consecutive time both UF and Alabama (3-3, 2-3 SEC) bring a top-10 ranking into a meeting. The two schools tied last year for second place at the SEC Championships.
“(Alabama loves) getting up for 
really tough challenges and great competition,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. “Obviously we’re not watching that team, but historically 
if it’s a very strong, great team, it makes you compete harder. It honestly brings out 
the best gymnastics I think.”
The closest thing to its “best 
gymnastics” UF has had this year came against Michigan State on Val-entine’s Day. While setting a season-best score, the team saw its well of potential despite a few mistakes.The biggest problem for the Ga-
tors in East Lansing, Mich., and something they may not be able to afford if they hope to beat the Crim-son Tide, was vault landings.
Vault proved statistically to be 
UF’s worst event against the Spar-
tans, scoring a 49.125, tying the 
team’s lowest score this season.
One of the so-to-speak new addi-
tions to the vault lineup was Aman-da Castillo. Castillo came back to the vault lineup for the first time since the Gators’ opening meet Jan. 9. She scored a 9.8 on Saturday, the same as she did Jan. 9.
Faehn said Castillo, who has been 
nursing bursitis in her ankle, would be in the vault lineup again with a lower degree of difficulty until she’s ready to do her full routine.
“(She) does not want to rest. She 
does not want to be given any lee-way,” Faehn said. 
“She wants to be pushed and she 
wants to be out there because she knows that she wants to give every-thing for this team.”
GymnasticsTeams have heated history
uf f OOTBALLWEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15
in January after 11 years at the 
school.
Gottfried was pushed out 
amid pressure from the Tide’s poor season and the surprising departure of star point guard Ronald Steele.
Steele, who at one time was 
considered to be a first-round NBA prospect by scouts, quit the team on Jan. 20 after becoming disheartened with the way inju-ries had derailed his career.
“I had a conversation about 
this the other day with Urban (Meyer),” Donovan said. “It is all so fragile in a lot of ways — the 
highlights of things when things 
are really, really incredible and then, maybe, when you’ve got some challenges. When I look at my time here, I probably have 
grown more as a person and 
coach through the challenging parts than when things were great.”
The Gators’ absence from the NCAA Tournament last season 
was chalked up to their inexperi-
ence.
One year later, not much has 
changed.
UF is currently sitting on six 
conference wins with the same number to play. 
With an RPI that is 
currently 45th in the 
nation and with only one signa-ture win to speak of (Washington back in November), the Gators 
will likely need 10 wins in the SEC to slide into the field of 65.
“I’m actually in a certain way 
— and I know because the level 
we’ve been at, people don’t may-be have a tendency of looking 
at it this way — but the reality 
is I think our team totally over-achieved last year,” Donovan said. 
UF follows up its game against 
Alabama with Vanderbilt at home on Saturday.
The team considers both 
games must-wins. 
“It’s not time to panic, but it’s time to clamp down,” guard Erv-
ing Walker said. 
“We’ve got to win. We can’t 
have many more losses. Yes, we 
have to win these (next) two 
games.”
The Gators have not lost at 
home this season.
After their two home games, 
UF heads to Baton Rouge, La., to meet up with LSU, the top team 
in the SEC.
The Tigers are currently on a 
six-game winning streak.
Gators consider home games against Alabama, Vanderbilt must-wins
two and saw their SEC title hopes shrink in the blink of an 
eye.
Following the loss to the Tigers on Sunday, UF coach 
Amanda Butler talked about her team being mentally weak 
and not playing with the toughness that has been the Gators’ trademark all season.
The result: missed free throws and unforced turnovers.
Still, Butler doesn’t see a reason to panic because she 
knows those things are under her team’s control.Instead, she wants to focus on where the Gators have had 
success this season as opposed to where they’ve failed.
“As a staff, we’ve talked a lot — and what we’re about to 
go in here in the locker room and talk about with the team is 
not what happened in the last two ballgames, but what hap-pened in the 22 wins before those ballgames,” Butler said.“That’s what I’m more interested in us being consumed 
with right now.”
She added that she doesn’t want her team to beat itself up 
over what happened in its losses, considering what UF was up against.
“It’s two really good ball teams on their home floor,” But-
ler said. 
“It was a really tough stretch to go Tennessee, to Vandy, to 
LSU. It’s hard, but that’s the way this league is.”
Butler, Brooks and Dotson know there are no excuses and 
no one to feel sorry for UF, not even themselves.Butler chooses to focus on 22 wins more than UF’s two consecutive defeats
filed by the ex-girlfriend, his No. 1 goal in 
life is to kill someone, and later in the re-port the girlfriend writes that he said he 
wouldn’t care about going to jail for such 
behavior.
This is serious stuff. It is also the Gators’ 
fourth arrest in the past 10 months. 
The other three players arrested are no longer with the team.
Former safety Jamar Hornsby was 
charged with felony credit card fraud, kicked off the team, made a plea deal for probation and fines and will play for Mis-sissippi in the fall.
Former cornerback Jacques Rickerson 
was arrested on charges of felony battery and booted from the Gators.
Former quarterback Cam Newton was 
accused of stealing a student’s laptop and  has since transferred to Blinn College, a Texas junior college.
While Meyer did what was necessary, it 
needs to be recognized that the departure of those three players hardly made an im-pact on the team. Each was easily replace-able.
Johnson would not be a similar case. 
UF lost two starting offensive linemen due to graduation (Phil Trautwein, Jason Wat-kins).  Johnson filled in for injured senior Jim Tartt at left guard and started eight games last season.
But that is no excuse for Meyer to go 
any easier on him if the allegations prove true. 
Meyer’s credibility will take a severe 
blow if he were to let Johnson slide after 
such terrible actions.
The right choices aren’t always obvi-
ous.

ON TELEVISION I DID NOT KNOW THAT POLL QUESTIONBy CHRISTOPHER YAZBEC
Alligator Writer
cyazbec@alligator.org
Losing is already a tough 
enough thing to deal with, espe-
cially for a team that rarely expe-riences it.
So getting dismantled in back-
to-back road games must have a much more troubling effect on a team’s psyche.
Sha Brooks and Marshae Dot-
son, UF’s team leaders, aren’t buying that.
“We’re perfectly fine,” Dotson 
said. “We’re 22-4. I don’t see any-thing bad about that. We’re still 
having a great year.”
Although the No. 15 Gators 
(22-4, 8-3 Southeastern Confer-
ence) were out-toughed, out-
hustled and flat-out 
whooped by Vander-
bilt and LSU over the weekend, Brooks and Dotson are not letting 
those outcomes affect them or 
their team mentally.
At the same time, it’s hard for 
them to forget what happened.
“You want to, but deep down 
inside it’s still there,” Dotson said. “We brought it on ourselves.”
Added Brooks: “We’re just ba-
sically focusing on us right now. Just figuring out what it is that 
we do best and just trying to get back to the team we were before these two losses. We just pretty 
much move forward.”
It sounds simple enough.
After each loss this season, UF 
has bounced back with 15- and seven-game winning streaks, 
setting school records with each 
streak. The 15-game run was the 
longest in school history, and the seven-game streak was a UF re-cord for SEC games.
That pattern changed when 
the Gators turned one loss into Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff

Times have been better for the UF basket-
ball program.
After losing three of their last four games, 
the Gators have fallen from first place in the 
Southeastern Conference to fourth in the Eastern Division and are once again fighting for their NCAA Tournament lives.
But don’t try to send UF coach Billy Dono-
van into a panic over it.
This is exactly what he signed up for.“One of the things that I looked at and 
knew going into last year and the opportu-
nity that I had after 2007 was the challenge 
of taking on — just knowing there was going to be a drastic drop off,” Donovan said. “A drastic drop off in talent, a drastic drop off in 
experience and just a drastic drop off of just 
having a lot of guys coming in that were go-ing to be thrust into situations with no level of leadership above them and having to go through it and figure it out.”
When Donovan spurned the NBA’s Orlan-
do Magic in favor of a return to Gainesville following the Gators’ 2007 national cham-pionship, he said he looked forward to the challenge of starting over from scratch.
He’s certainly had the opportunity to do 
so.
When UF (19-6, 6-4 SEC) plays Alabama 
(13-11, 3-7 SEC) tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center, Donovan will be reminded of how 
rare such longevity and job security is in ma-
jor college basketball.

To keep credibility, Meyer must boot JohnsonSEE HOOPS, PAGE 15

SEE PHIL, PAGE 15When Urban Meyer returns to the 
United States, he is not going to be happy.
See, Meyer is one of those guys who 
likes to give players second chances. He likes to give them a chance to redeem themselves. That opportunity is filled with 
punishment, including extra sprints and 
lifts, but if the player makes it through, all sides feel happy and redeemed. On the whole, it’s not a bad policy — everyone is human, after all.
But as my parents always said, there 
are some mistakes you just can’t make.And if the al-
legations against offensive line-
man Carl John-
son are true, then the rising sophomore has 
committed one 
of those unac-ceptable lapses in judgment.
Meyer will 
have no choice. Johnson must be kicked off the team.To be clear, I firmly believe in the man-
tra of “innocent until proven guilty”. But if Johnson’s ex-girlfriend’s claims are true, 
he deserves all the punishment coming to 
him.
And this will prove to be Meyer’s lat-
est test of keeping his team full of “high-
character” guys.
The claims made by Johnson’s ex-girl-
friend are fall-out-of-your-chair shocking.
The 6-foot-6, 345-pound Johnson is ac-
