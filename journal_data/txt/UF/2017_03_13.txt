Editor’s note: Smith Meyers de-
clined to answer any questions re-garding his arrest after multiple requests for comment. Read his state-
ment on page 7.Despite student criticism of UF 
Student Body President-elect Wil-
liam Smith Meyers’ Spring Break ar-rest, several university and campus leaders have remained silent.
Key West Police arrested Meyers 
on a charge of criminal mischief at about 2 a.m. Tuesday after a witness reported seeing Meyers, 22, drunk-enly attempt to start and knock over two Harley-Davidson motorcycles, according to an arrest report.
“Meyers was so intoxicated that 
he did not even recall coming down to Key West for spring break vaca-tion,” the arresting ofﬁ  cer wrote in the report. 
In a statement 
released Sunday, 
Meyers wrote that 
he recognized he 
had to earn back the trust of those around him, and apologized for representing UF 
in a negative light.
“I am fully cooperating with law enforcement to resolve this incident and will be as transparent as pos-sible as the case continues,” he said.
Meyers was arrested less than two 
weeks after his successful and unop-posed run to be the next Student Body president under the campaign slogan, “Character that counts.”
Since Meyers’ release from the 
Monroe County Detention Center on Tuesday afternoon on a $328 bond, 
 UF Student Body president-elect speaks out after arrest

Caroline Celeste Alfano felt free.She wasn’t wearing makeup, 
she didn’t do her hair and she was wearing one of her favorite tie-dye dresses as she walked barefoot at 
Okeechobee Music and Arts Festival 
on March 5. She and her best friend, Meghan Mapes, admired the art on display after watching one of their favorite musicians, Porter Robinson, perform the night before.
“She looked at me and said how 
free she felt,” Mapes, 21, said. It was the ﬁ  fth and ﬁ  nal festival the two friends, who met through the soror-ity Kappa Kappa Gamma, would at-tend.
Alfano was still wearing the tie-
dye dress as she left to drive home 
with Nicole Scherten, 23, a UF Ger-
man exchange student who attended the festival with her. Alfano, a UF architecture senior, left the festival early because she wanted to spend time with Scherten at home in Boca Raton, Florida.
As the pair drove home, Joseph 
David Lagrego, 22, rear-ended their stopped car at the corner of South-east 128th Avenue and State Road 710. As a result, Alfano’s 2015 Hon-da CR-V crashed into the vehicle in front of her, which then struck the one in front of it, according to Alliga-tor archives.
Scherten, a German exchange 
student studying in the UF College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, was pro-nounced dead at the scene. Alfano was rushed to a local hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, ac-cording to Alligator archives.
“There’s no way (Alfano) can’t 
be here anymore,” Mapes said. “I still haven’t accepted that it hap-pened.”
On Thursday, a memorial will be 
held for Alfano at 5:30 p.m. at the 
Architecture atrium, according to an 
email from Jen Day Shaw, the as-sociate vice president and Dean of Students.

Nicole Scherten hoped her ﬁ  rst 
semester at UF would lead to a life 
in the U.S.
The Aachen, Germany, native 
applied to UF after she and her 
boyfriend, Marcel Dilk, had visited Clearwater, Florida, and the Keys and fell in love with the state. With aspirations of becoming a German language professor at an American university, Scherten left the Univer-sity of Bonn for a semester abroad in Gainesville.
“She liked to meet people and 
speak to people,” Dilk, 25, said. “She found a lot of good friends at the uni-
versity.”
Alfano was one of those friends. 
The pair met at a UF NaviGators 
International meeting — beginning Spring 2015, Alfano served as his-torian — where they bonded over their love of music and travel. The two eventually made plans to spend Spring Break together at the music 
festival and then Alfano’s home.

where U.S. Rep. T ed Yoho’s town hall took place March 4. Some protesters held signs and chanted throughout the whole town hall meeting.By Meryl Kornﬁ  eld

Deputies arrested a man March 
4 after he punched a supporter of President Donald Trump in the face after an argument outside Countryside Baptist Church.
Michael Robert Chriss, 64, 
punched Charles Duane Webster, 61, as the two joined a crowd of hundreds outside the church, located at 10926 NW 39th Ave. The crowd, primarily protesters, gathered following a town hall meeting with U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho in the church. Yoho, a Republican who 
represents Florida’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes Alachua, Clay and 
Bradford counties and parts 
of Marion County, answered 
questions about issues such as Trump’s temporary travel ban, 
health care, LGBTQ+ rights 
and the alleged ties between the 
president’s administration and 
Russia. The protesters were not allowed inside the town hall and, 
instead, chanted and waved signs.

he declined to answer any questions 
about the incident. Impact Party spokesperson Janae Moodie and UF 
Senate President Jackie Phillips (Im-
pact) have not responded to requests for comment.
UF President Kent Fuchs declined 
to comment on Meyers’ arrest. Jen Day Shaw, the Dean of Students, de-clined to comment as well.UF Spokesperson John Hines 
wrote in an email that the univer-sity is aware of Meyers’ arrest and “his status as a UF student has not changed.”
“Generally, a misdemeanor type 
of offense would not impact a stu-dent’s enrollment,” Hines said.
Despite being reportedly drunk 
in public, Meyers was not arrested 
on an alcohol-related charge. In an 
interview with the Gainesville Sun, Key West Police spokesperson Aly-son Crean said officers in the island city try to use discretion when con-sidering charges against college stu-dents who visit for Spring Break.
“We don’t want to ruin this kid’s 
life for knocking over a couple of bikes,” Crean told the Sun.  
UF student Anthony Rojas is 
holding a protest Tuesday on Turl-ington Plaza to demand for Meyers’ 
resignation. The 21-year-old politi-
cal science junior said he hopes UF makes an example out of Meyers and asks for his resignation. Meyers’ alleged behavior smeared the univer-sity’s reputation — the incident was reported in news outlets across the country — and should not be toler-ated.
‘If nothing is done in this particu-
lar case, then people will think it’s alright,” he said.
In March 2010, UF Student Body 
President Jordan Johnson was cited for disorderly conduct by the Univer-sity Police Department after demand-ing a ride from the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol, or SNAP, to his off-campus housing. He was cited and finished his term as Student Body president a couple months later.
UF Student Senator Zachariah 
Chou (Independent, Infinity Hall) said he believes Meyers should re-sign, because public officials need to be held to a higher standard.  
“If I were in his shoes, I know 
what I would have to do,” Chou said. “I would just resign.”
MEYERS,  from pg.1UF and SG officials have declined from commenting on his arrest said UF NaviGators International President Sara Horning, was indicative of her generos-ity.
“She was always looking out for every-
one,” the 21-year-old UF public relations se-
nior said. “She saw the best in people, more 
than anyone else.”
Friends say they’ll remember Alfano’s 
kindness and passion for architecture, a ma-jor she chose after realizing her love for visual arts. Hoping to become a New York architect, she would work until 5 a.m. in her studio in Fine Arts C, on top of working as a lifeguard for UF RecSports and swimming for UF’s club 
team.
“She’s very much a perfectionist when it 
comes to her architecture work,” Mapes said. 
“She wanted to get it just right.”
Scherten was fascinated by the cultural 
differences between her home country and the U.S. She and her friends would play bad-minton every Sunday, and her friend Palani Te said she had a sweet tooth. Te, a 20-year-
old UF health education and behavior junior, 
would go with Scherten to Midnight Cookies and Cold Stone Creamery.
“She was like a sister to me,” he said.Te said Scherten was successfully adjust-
ing to life at UF. He said she had received an internship helping a UF German professor and was focusing on her future career as a lan-guage professor.
“She was quiet, but when she got excited, 
she got very, very excited,” he said.
•   •   •
The sudden loss, Dilk said, has been felt 
across two countries. 
He planned to surprise Scherten in April 
by visiting her in Gainesville. Instead, he flew to Florida on Friday with Scherten’s family to clean out her apartment. They didn’t find out about her death until three days after the crash because of a miscommunication be-tween Florida Highway Patrol and German authorities.
“We had the same goals,” he said. “We al-
ways wanted to go to the U.S. and live here.”
Alfano’s friends started a GoFundMe on 
Friday to place two bricks honoring the stu-dents on campus. The page’s goal was $2,000 and, as of press time, $3,020 has been raised.
The extra funds will go back to the families 
of the two women, Mapes said.
She said she doesn’t want to go home to 
the apartment she and Alfano shared behind Midtown, where Alfano left sketches on the 
refrigerator door and an embroidery in the liv-
ing room. 
“We shared so much over the past two and 
half years,” Mapes said. “It’s things like that you take for granted.”EPILOGUE,  from pg.1The two became friends in 2015
A UF STUDENT RECEIVED THE 
MESSAGE WITH HER FOOD. 
By Molly Vossler
Alligator Staff Writer
A Papa John’s Pizza driver was fired over 
Spring Break after writing a joke about domes-
tic violence on the inside of a box of double 
chocolate chip brownies.
Josephine Fuller, a UF journalism and 
women’s studies sophomore, asked for a joke on the inside of the brownie box when she ordered from the Papa John’s on Southwest Archer Road on March 5. The 20-year-old said she often asks and has received several light-hearted jokes — “Why did the boy throw but-
ter out the window? Because he wanted to see 
butter fly.” — in response.
But this time, the joke was about domestic 
violence. 
“What do you tell a woman with two black 
eyes?” Fuller read. “Nothing, you already told her twice.”
When Fuller, a peer educator with UF’s 
Sexual Trauma/Interpersonal Violence Edu-cation, saw the message, she took a photo to post on Twitter and Facebook to express her disgust.
“This is the first time it’s ever been some-
thing of that nature,” she said. “I think that’s one of the reasons I was so shocked by it.”
The driver, who wrote the joke on his own 
accord, was fired, said Shane Little, who owns 
all three Papa John’s locations in Gainesville.
“We don’t condone his actions,” said Lit-
tle, who declined to identify the driver. “We 
don’t condone violence of any kind, particu-larly against women. We don’t think what he wrote was funny. We don’t write jokes in boxes; we just deliver pizzas.”
Fuller said when she reached out to the 
manager at the Southwest Archer Road loca-
tion, he asked her to delete her tweet.
Although she agreed to delete it after re-
ceiving a full refund, Fuller said she later re-
gretted it and decided to keep her Facebook post online, which read, “Just wanted to en-joy my meal and now I’m sick to my stomach. Last time I order from there.”
“I feel like I’d be doing a greater injustice 
to not have anybody know about this,” Fuller 
said.

WORKER HECKLED THE 
GROUP .
By Michael Smith
Alligator Contributing Writer
On the edge of UF’s campus 
Wednesday afternoon, a protester 
asked a group of about 50 how far 
the U.S. has progressed toward gen-der equality since the 1970s.
“Not far enough,” the group 
chanted back.
The protesters, standing on the 
corner of Southwest 13th Street and 
University Avenue, were participat-
ing in the International Women’s Strike, held on International Wom-
en’s Day. The National Women’s 
Liberation, the feminist group that organized the local strike, encour-aged Gainesville women to strike 
from paid jobs and unpaid labor, 
like household chores and child-
care, to emphasize women’s role in 
the workplace, said Hizel Levy, an organizer for the group. 
“There’s political education 
that’s involved in calling a strike,” 
Levy said.
As of Tuesday, more than 30,000 
people registered their intent to par-
ticipate in national strikes, accord-
ing to The New York Times. Strikes also happened in places like Rome, 
Italy, and Seoul, South Korea. 
In Gainesville, women took 
turns speaking into a megaphone and sharing their experiences with 
gender discrimination and oppres-sion in the U.S. 
Jessie-Leigh Seago, a UF politi-
cal science doctoral student, spoke 
about how women are brought up 
in a patriarchal system and said 
those with privilege need to strike 
for those unable to miss paid work.  
“I’m here because I’m fortunate 
enough that I can be,” the 28-year-old said.
Seago and another protester said 
they saw a construction worker near The Standard at Gainesville holding a cardboard sign reading, “Make America grab p----,” and lewdly thrusting toward the women while wearing a Trump hat. The construc-
tion worker, employed under Land-
mark Properties, which is building The Standard at the corner of South-west 13th Street and University Av-
enue, declined to comment.  
Protesters also marched to 
Gainesville City Hall for a candle-
light vigil hosted by the Gainesville/
Ocala chapter of the Women’s 
March on Washington.
At the vigil, the crowd sang 
MILCK’s song “Quiet,” which pro-testers have used as an anthem 
during national Women’s Marches. 
Organizers encouraged protesters to dedicate the evening to a powerful woman in their life.
Levy said the strike made 
Gainesville women feel connected 
to the larger movement. 
“We can have a collective pow-
er,” she said. “It gives us a chance to define who we are and feel our 
power.”‘Collective Power’: Local women

People always stare at Cameron 
Haight’s hands. 
The 4-year-old’s ﬁ  ngers are 
twisted together and fused, the re-
sult of a condition called amniotic band syndrome.
“It’s like everywhere we go, 
people ask about his hands,” his mother, Sarah, 31, said of their life in Charlotte, North Carolina.
But over the weekend, along 
the vast land at Camp Crystal Lake in Starke, Florida, Haight said she could tell her son was unusually at ease among strangers. 
He was at the campsite to attend 
this year’s Hand Camp, hosted by the nonproﬁ  t Hands to Love, just 30 minutes north of Gainesville. At-tending for the second time, Cam-eron was one of about 70 children who all have what organizers refer to as limb differences. 
“Here, he is the normal,” Haight 
said.From Friday to Sunday, fami-
lies from across the country came to Starke, partaking in bonﬁ  res, hayrides, educational presentations 
and long nights under the stars. 
Ruthie Dell, who started the 
camp with her husband, Paul, in 
2001, said the three-day camp is 
a way to demystify the differences 
among the children.
“It’s a safe haven,” said Dell, an 
occupational therapist who special-izes in treating patients’ arms and 
hands at UF Health Shands Hospi-
tal.
A trio of UF doctoral students 
gave a presentation Friday about their mind-controlled drones, 
which they used in 2016 to host 
what they billed as the world’s ﬁ  rst 
“brain drone race.” On Saturday, 
the UF group GRiP brought the campers activity-speciﬁ  c prosthet-
ics they designed, including one at-
tached to a ﬁ  shing rod and another 
with a pingpong paddle.
The featured speaker at the 
camp was Kyle Smith, a 32-year-old from Illinois who lost his arm in an eight-story fall from his balcony in 2010. An avid hunter, Smith said he refused to let his lack of a right arm stop him from practicing archery; he pulls the trigger with his mouth.
For him, being able to reach 
children with limb differences at a young age and instill in them the motivation to continue living their lives uninterrupted gives him a sense of purpose.
“You can do anything you want 
to do if you put your mind to it,” 
Smith said.
Kim Vogelgesang, 47, traveled 
to the camp from Cincinnati, Ohio, 
with her 12-year-old son Gabe. As 
Gabe looked on during the drone 
presentation, Vogelgesang said 
learning about the future of tech along with his peers and being in-stilled with a can-do attitude was a 
powerful experience.
“I just enjoy seeing my son’s 
light shine,” she said.  At Hand Camp in Starke, kids with disabilities ﬁ  nd haven

Say it one more time for the people in the back
Last week, Republicans offered their take 
on a new health care plan in order to keep their promise to “repeal and re-place” the Patient Protection and Af-fordable Care Act. Despite criticism from 
both sides of the political aisle, many Repub-licans in the House of Representatives zeal-ously pushed their plan through as quickly as possible, with two House committees approv-ing it last Thursday and votes from two more committees coming up this week.
Just following the news back and forth, I 
felt confused. Some Republicans called the GOP-backed plan “Obamacare Lite,” while others de-
cried it for stripping down too much. I knew the basics 
of former President Barack Obama’s health care law, but I still needed some concrete facts: What exactly is this law that Republicans are so excited to dismantle?
Signed into law by Obama in 2010, the Affordable 
Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, made several key changes to our previous system. Here’s an extreme-ly brief run-down of some of the law’s features: It en-sured companies couldn’t deny people coverage due to 
preexisting conditions, allowed children to stay on their 
parents’ plans until they turned 26 and mandated that all Americans buy insurance, unless insured by Medi-care, Medicaid or other programs, or they’d face a pen-alty. 
What’s more, the Affordable Care Act made insurers 
cover contraceptives, maternity care and preventive ser-vices, including mammograms, at no cost to the people they beneﬁ  ted. Let me state that more plainly. The law 
made it easier to access affordable women’s health care.
Naturally, hearing that Republicans are about to 
wipe away a law expanding access to women’s health 
care and coverage has made me angry. The good news is this: As of now, in its ﬁ  rst instantiation, the GOP-backed plan will not take away maternity care or con-traception. As explained by NPR, “Because (the Re-publican plan) was a reconciliation bill, it could cover ﬁ  scal-related topics only. It couldn’t get into many of the particulars of what people’s cov-erage will look like, meaning some things won’t change. The essential health beneﬁ  ts set out in Obamacare — a list of 10 types of 
services that all plans must cover — do not 
change for other policies.”
The accessibility of this coverage, how-
ever, might not stay this way. On the same Thursday the GOP bill was pushed through two House committees, Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania asked Republican Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois which parts of Obam-
acare he took issue with in terms of its health care plan 
requirements. Fingers crossed for a rational reply, right?
Wrong (though I’m not sure who expects rational-
ity from politics anymore). In response, Shimkus asked, 
“What about men having to purchase prenatal care?”
Ah, yes. Positively brilliant. Because men clearly 
lack the necessary anatomic features to birth children, they can’t possibly be held ﬁ  scally responsible for the care required to have those babies birthed. One more problem: Health care plans just don’t function this way. 
Everyone pays for all types of coverage, even the ones 
they won’t necessarily use, because in a health care sys-tem, the healthy pay for the coverage of the sick. And from year to year, we never know the group into which we’ll fall. Even though this is what some Republicans want — to be able to pick and choose the exact services we want in personalized insurance plans — it is simply impossible to succeed on a grand scale.
But just for a moment, let us envision an American 
health care system that somehow had this capability to cover every individual with his or her own individual plan, tailored exactly to his or her known, unknown, fu-ture and possible illnesses. Can someone please explain to Shimkus how men might still, I don’t know, play a role in reproduction?

philosophy junior. Her column appears on Mondays.Smith Meyers 
needs to be held 
accountable
A UF student made national news over Spring Break.
If you caught a glimpse of the headlines, you know it 
wasn’t for casting UF in a positive light.
Six days ago, the Alligator, along with other local and 
national outlets, reported that police arrested UF Student 
Body President-elect Smith Meyers in Key West after police said 
he drunkenly knocked over two Harley-Davidson motorcycles 
during Spring Break. An arresting ofﬁ  cer said he was so drunk he 
didn’t even know he was in Key West. He was jailed and released 
after posting a $328 bail.
By then, Meyers’ name had made headlines in publications 
as far reaching as the New York Post and the Associated Press.
Where was Meyers during all of this?For ﬁ  ve days, he and Impact Party’s spokesperson ignored 
repeated calls from multiple Alligator reporters, unwilling to an-swer questions. Instead, Sunday evening we received statements from Meyers and current Student Body President Susan Webster, 
which appeared insincere and contradictory. In Webster’s state-ment, for example, she calls Meyers’ actions uncharacteristic before lampooning the media for reporting on the details of his 
arrest, which she says are “still being determined.”
In Meyers’ statement, he says he recognizes he must “work to 
earn back the trust of those around me,” and he promises to be 
“as transparent as possible” as his case continues.
But how, we wonder, can he do that when he ignores his 
constituents for ﬁ  ve days before releasing a statement? How can 
he expect to gain public trust when he refuses to answer a single 
question from those he represents?
Webster was clear in her statement when she said Meyers’ 
position in Student Government would not be called into ques-tion following this arrest.
We at the Alligator believe Meyers should have done more 
to take responsibility for his actions. Instead of immediately ad-
dressing the Student Body during the time following his arrest, 
he did nothing. We can only imagine he and Impact were doing 
damage control, waiting until the very end of Spring Break to 
release a statement. 
Why did Meyers’ arrest make such an impact? As the next 
UF Student Body president, Meyers is in line to help oversee a more than $20 million Student Government budget, along with 
taking the only student position on the UF Board of Trustees. As 
a trustee, he would be charged with representing students to the 
governing body of UF.
No one forced the position upon Meyers. We can only infer it 
was what he wanted when he chose to run for Student Body pres-ident. He knew going in he would take it, as he ran unopposed. 
This story deserved to be covered, not because we seek to 
sensationalize any incident but because, as with any elected of-
ﬁ  cial, be it at a university, local, state or national level, we be-
lieve those elected are accountable to the people they represent. 
Meyers, who campaigned on the motto “Character that counts,” made the decision to represent more than 50,000 students when 
he ran for arguably the highest position in UF SG.
If Meyers wants to earn the Student Body’s respect, he needs 
to start by respecting us. If Meyers wants to be transparent, he 
needs to start by answering our questions.
We can only hope he starts now.

A statement from UF Student Body Presi-
dent-elect Smith Meyers 
Hello Gators,Early in the morning Tuesday, March 7, I 
was involved in an incident with the local po-
lice while on Spring Break in Key West, Flori-
da. Even though the case is still under review, as the Student Body president-elect of UF, I am called to a higher standard. Though I am im-perfect and human, the ofﬁ  ce I was elected to calls me to be an example to those I represent. I failed in this and offer my sincere apologies to everyone affected by my actions and to all Gators for representing UF in such a negative 
light. While I am appreciative of the love and 
support I have received from everyone dur-ing this time, I also recognize I have let a lot of people down and must work to earn back the trust of those around me. As many peo-ple know, I ran on the motto “Character that counts.” This incident, while out of character, undoubtedly contradicts that motto. Nonethe-less, I remain committed to good character and will work to prove it throughout my term. I am fully cooperating with law enforcement to resolve this incident and will be as transparent as possible as the case continues.
Smith Meyers is the UF Student Body 
president-elect. 
A statement from UF Student Body Presi-
dent 
I have known Smith Meyers my whole 
life and know just how out of character his actions were. I know ﬁ  rsthand how regretful he is to have represented our university in a 
negative light, and I am conﬁ  dent he will work 
that much harder for students in proving he has character that counts. I am committed to ﬁ  nishing out my term strong and aiding Smith in his transition as much as possible. I know Smith is eager to put this minor misdemeanor charge behind him and learn from it so he may continue to work on behalf of students like he has for the past four years. As the university does not investigate minor offenses for con-duct purposes, I understand his status as a student and as a Student Body ofﬁ  cer will not change. While many outlets have dramatized 
the facts of the situation, which are still be-
ing determined, my personal sentiments align most closely with Key West Police Department spokesperson Alyson Crean, who stated, “We don’t want to ruin this kid’s life for knocking over a couple of bikes,” according to this pub-lication. 
Susan Webster is the UF Student Body 
president.
 A statement from a UF student
Out of respect for every student, UF’s Stu-
dent Code of Conduct and the legacy of The 
Gator Nation, Student Body President-elect Smith Meyers should step down immediately.
Meyers’ unopposed campaign has made him more than just a campus representative. He will be placed on UF’s Board of Trustees as the only student to serve as our voice. The president’s advocacy for students extends to meetings with politicians from local to national 
levels. Such a privileged position demands 
someone who can be trusted.
Instead, Meyers’ Spring Break endeavors 
have painted him as careless, with a lack of regard for his prestigious role within Florida’s best public university. We deserve better.
Meyers’ statement claiming commitment 
to character is all but promising, and it’s not enough to ensure UF is being represented by its 
best. Student Body President Susan Webster’s 
comments attempt to defend Meyers by claim-ing his behavior was “out of character.”
If character is what counts, then “out of 
character” is unacceptable. Meyers must re-sign.

Today is every college stu-dent’s least favorite day of the year: the ﬁ  rst day of classes after Spring Break. I completely un-
derstand. In fact, I wrote this in a car on the way back from my own fantastic trip. Today is especially irritating because we get all the frustration of return-ing to normal life without any of the excitement of starting fresh or being close to ﬁ  nishing a semester.
While I certainly agree that today is a let-
down, I’m going to ignore that for a moment. Let’s talk about how great the concept that brought us to this post-break depression is.
Travel is truly amazing. I feel that some-
times we take advantage of it. If we are going somewhere we’ve already been, it may seem less exciting. If we’d rather go somewhere we’ve already been, the new destination may 
not meet expectations. With social media, we 
are constantly comparing ourselves to others, wondering if we’re having as much fun as they are or if our trips stack up to the others.
Instead of comparing our vacation to oth-
ers, we should be comparing a life ﬁ  lled with adventure to a life lived in one place. Before 
the days of air, car or boat travel, we were 
stuck. Now, you can jump in your car and be in the next state in a matter of hours. Hop on a plane, and you can be across an ocean over-night. As college students, we are at a unique stage in our lives. We have a designated time of year in which we’re not only allowed but encour-aged to leave normalcy behind and 
do whatever we’d like.
I saw photos and heard stories 
of people taking off in every direc-
tion. Students took off for Europe, cruised to Mexico, did service proj-ects in South America, went on mis-sion trips, skied down mountains and 
visited big cities all across America. This is incredible. We’re used to sitting in our dorms 
or apartments in Gainesville, and each Spring 
we get to take a break from our school life and do other things. Why waste time thinking about what other people are doing or what else we could be doing? Whatever you are do-ing, it is different from what is normal. Even if you went to visit family for Spring Break or stayed in town for work, we still get a week 
off school. Life is good, guys. It may not feel 
like it right now, but think back to a week ago. I hope you got to spend your break doing something you love with someone you love. I hope you went on an adventure or had some much-deserved peace and quiet. Whatever you did, let it propel you through these next 
few weeks.

opinions@alligator.orgA few weeks ago, I was 
treated by an orthopedic surgeon for a recurring shoulder injury. It didn’t take long for introduc-
tory small talk to reveal I was a medical student, and my doc-tor and I became quite friendly. My appointment was graciously extended as we continued to chat long after my shoulder had been examined. We exchanged stories about our respective medical school experiences, discussed my career plans 
and talked about how much medicine has 
changed over the last few decades. At the close of the visit, the doctor said he had a single piece of advice to assist me in my nascent quest to become a successful physi-cian. 
His sage words of wisdom? “Read Sher-
lock Holmes.”
This tip might strike you as more than a 
bit odd. It certainly caught me off guard at ﬁ  rst. However, if you are a pre-med or medi-cal student, put the idea to the test. (I’m cur-rently halfway through novel No. 4.)
For starters, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the 
author of the 60 novels and short stories 
about the world’s ﬁ  rst “consulting detec-
tive,” was himself a physician. 
It is also important to know that the 
two main characters in this novel, and all of the Sherlock Holmes works that followed, were largely taken from Doyle’s own life. Dr. John Watson shares striking similari-ties with Doyle himself: Both are 
physicians who transition from a 
career in medicine to one focused on writing. Holmes, on the other hand, was modeled after a medical school professor, Dr. Joseph Bell, who inspired Doyle by his uncanny ability to make difﬁ  cult diagnoses 
with seemingly limited and unrelated clini-cal clues; in other words, his ability to solve 
medical mysteries.
With this in mind, it is easy to see that 
Doyle’s stories are about more than just 
crime-solving. At their core, their plots re-volve around Holmes — modeled after the brilliant diagnostician — who is training Watson, and Watson represents the young doctor striving to sharpen his skills in what 
Doyle calls “the science of deduction.” As 
each murder or robbery develops, Holmes takes time to instruct his friend on how to develop and apply awareness, thoughtful-ness and inference. Holmes sums up his as-sessment of the ever-eager but often simple-minded Watson in one succinct sentence: 
“You see, but you do not observe.”

Florida football announces spring promotions 
The Gators will feature three promotions surrounding this season's Orange and Blue Debut. First, two fans will serve as honorary coaches during the game. Second, UF stu-
dents will be able to participate in a ﬂ  ag football tournament leading up to the game. And third, UF will host a wing cookoff.  For more info, visit FloridaGators.com. Senior Maria T orres led the Florida women's golf team to a win in its only home tournament of the season over the weekend. For a full recap, see pg. 15By Matt Brannon
Sports Writer
NASHVILLE, Tenn.  — After an 
abrupt exit from the SEC Tourna-ment, Florida will enter March Madness as a No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament. 
The Gators will play No. 13-
seed East Tennessee State (27-7) on Thursday in Orlando. The Buc-caneers are coming off a Southern Conference Championship and have won nine of their last 10 games.
Meanwhile, Florida heads into 
the tournament having lost back-to-back games to Vanderbilt, in-cluding a 72-62 overtime loss that 
bounced the Gators from the SEC 
Tournament in their ﬁ  rst game.
Having lost three of their last 
four games, guards Kasey Hill and 
KeVaughn Allen were asked if the 
team has lost momentum. 
Allen deﬂ  ected. Hill said no. 
“I don’t think we lost momen-
tum,” Hill said. “We got to get back to practicing and get better in practice.”
That wasn’t White’s opinion. 
“I disagree with my guys. We 
obviously have lost momentum,” 
White said. 
UF’s one-and-done performance 
in Nashville in the SEC Tourna-
ment likely cost the Gators the  Gators awarded No. 4 seed in NCAA 
tourney despite losing momentum
NASHVILLE,  
Tenn. — The Gators 
held the world’s sad-dest pizza party in a solemn locker room 
after being bounced 
from the SEC Tour-nament in their ﬁ  rst game.
About 15 min-
utes fresh off their most disappointing loss of the sea-son, tournament ofﬁ  cials opened the locker room to reporters for 
postgame interviews as players 
munched crust and cheese in near-silence.
I had the privilege of walking up 
to players when they were in their worst mood: 600 miles away from home, tired and sore — not exactly feeling like social butterﬂ  ies.
I don’t want to sound like I’m 
complaining. Watching basketball professionally is an awesome job.
But man, that locker room was 
bleak.  
And after probably their most 
painful loss  — falling to Vander-bilt for a third time — I was tasked with asking these people just how painful it was.
I wasn’t just picking at a fresh 
scab. I was jabbing it with a micro-phone and asking how bad it hurt.
I walked up to point guard Chris 
Chiozza. I asked him about play-ing in front of a heavy Vanderbilt crowd, since the tournament was held just one-and-a-half miles from the Commodores’ campus.
“Did you feel like the crowd 
was a factor, like they had a home-court advantage?”
“Nah.”“It didn’t mess with you guys?”“Nah.”Thanks for that.I get it.You don’t want to 
unload your deepest thoughts at your most vulnerable moment to a semi-stranger hold-ing a plastic recorder in your face. That’s under-standable.
But it’s also deﬁ  nite-
ly true that the crowd was louder than 1,000 
Nashville bachelorette parties, and it’d be nice to get the players’ per-spective on the atmosphere.
Oh well, I moved on.I tried forward Devin Robinson.He put his headphones on when 
I approached even though they weren’t plugged into anything.
To his credit, he still politely 
answered all of my probing ques-tions, which made my job a lot easier.
But being forced to interview 
someone at their lowest point is inconceivably awkward if you’ve 
never done it before.
It’s more awkward than ask-
ing your Lyft driver not to text and 
drive.
More awkward than bringing 
a trash can through the media en-trance so your photographer has something to sit on.
More awkward than booking a 
hotel for four nights only to have the team you’re covering lose its ﬁ  rst game.
And while I felt some sympathy 
for those players, those people, get-ting their thoughts after the game is critical for connecting the team to the fans reading our stories.
And while it sounds harsh, if 
you’re going to get up on a podium and bask in the glow after a big win, it’s only fair that you’re just as candid after a loss, even if that sounds … cheesy.  ‘So you guys got beat pretty bad, 
huh?’: Interviewing after losses

BASEBALL
By Patrick Pinak
Sports Writer 
It had been 756 days since Ryan 
Larson parked a ball outside McKethan 
Stadium. 
But on Saturday, the UF senior out-
ﬁ  elder blasted two home runs — tri-
pling his career total — to power the 
Gators to a series-capturing 4-3 win over Seton Hall.While Larson found his stroke over 
the past week — as did JJ Schwarz, who hammered his ﬁ  rst two homers of the year — not all came easy for Florida over Spring Break.
Before taking two of three from the 
Pirates, UF traveled to Fort Myers Tues-day for the ﬁ  rst of a pair of games ver-sus Florida Gulf Coast.
Neither fared well for the Gators 
(12-5).
UF dropped the ﬁ  rst contest 7-3, a loss in which starting pitcher Michael Byrne allowed ﬁ  ve runs (one earned) thanks in part to a costly error by third baseman Jonathan India.
The Wednesday 3-2 defeat, mean-
while, featured a common theme from Florida this season: little offense.
UF’s late rally in the ninth came up 
inches shy. After Schwarz pulled his team within one with a solo shot, India laced what looked to be a sure game-tying double.That was until FGCU center ﬁ  elder 
Gage Morey dove through the air to rob India and the Gators to end the game.
Florida was outhit 7-5.And with a midweek clash against 
Florida State looming Tuesday and SEC play beginning this weekend against Auburn, UF can only hope its bats wake up.

No. 3 seed they were projected to 
earn earlier in the season. 
The loss to Vanderbilt marked 
the fifth straight time UF’s fallen to the Commodores in the last two years. 
After building an early lead in 
Friday’s game, Florida’s commu-nication on defense dissipated as 
Vanderbilt took a halftime lead. 
But after the Commodores 
pulled away, the Gators nearly 
pulled off the comeback, erasing an 8-point Vanderbilt lead in a little 
over 90 seconds in the final min-
utes. 
When the game was tied with 
9.7 seconds in regulation, UF coach Mike White gave the ball to Hill.
“We’re hoping obviously that 
we could get to the rim, finish or get fouled with a couple shooters in the corners,” White said. 
But in heavy traffic, Hill’s layup 
missed left. 
The Commodores kicked off 
overtime with a 10-1 run and for the third time in one season, Vanderbilt (19-15) overtook Florida 
(24-8).
“When you go 0-3 against 
somebody, you wrack your brain,” 
White said. “I’ll be wracking my brain here until Sunday night. 
Should we have done this? Could 
we have tried this or that?”
Vanderbilt remains the only SEC 
team White hasn’t beat since be-coming Florida’s coach. 
The second-year coach admitted 
Florida doesn’t look like a confi-dent team.
“I think we’ve been in that place 
at times this year,” White said. 
“We’re not in that place right now.”

Florida led Texas A&M by 1.5 
points heading into the 4x400 meter 
relay.
All the Gators needed to do 
to earn their first indoor national 
championship since 2012 was out-last the Aggies. 
Florida sophomore Kunle Fasasi 
ran first for the Gators, and after briefly leading the pack, he was 
passed by Texas A&M senior Fred 
Kerley. In the next 400 meters, Florida 
freshman Grant Holloway obliter-ated a sizeable gap created by Texas A&M junior Robert Grant. Holloway took the lead as he approached his 
senior teammate Eric Futch for the 
the baton pass. 
Futch created a gap during his 
400 meters similar to what Grant 
had created previously.
It all came down to whether 
sophomore Ryan Clark could hold 
the lead.
And he did for about 300 meters. But as Clark rounded the curve going into the final straightaway, 
Texas A&M junior Mylik Kerley 
took the lead for final 100 meters, clinching the NCAA Indoor title for the Aggies and a runner-up finish for 
Florida.
A half point separated the Aggies 
and Gators, with their final scores 
being 46 and 45.5 respectively.
Despite the second place fin-
ish, two Gators walked away from 
competition with individual national 
championships. 
On Day 1, junior KeAndre Bates 
jumped his way to his first national title. Bates matched his indoor per-
sonal record of 26 feet, 4.5 inches in 
the men’s long jump final to capture Florida’s third long jump title in five years. 
Although happy, the El Paso, 
Texas, native said he still wasn’t 
fully satisfied after winning the title. 
“I just wanted to make sure no-
body passed me so I could get the 
10 points. I’m happy for the national 
championship, but I really wanted 
the 27 (foot jump). But it’s alright,” 
Bates said in a release. “I’m going to 
get it eventually. I’m being patient. Hopefully I keep progressing and get 
it later on.”
Despite Bates’ desire to be better, 
his coach said he did just fine. 
“Big thing is, he’s a national 
champion,” Florida coach Mike Hol-
loway said in a release. “He came in here, did what he always does, 
and that’s what this meet is about—
come in here, be who you are and things will work out the way they 
should.”
Bates managed to earn eight 
more points for his team with a sec-
ond-place finish in the men’s triple jump final on Day 2, making the 
junior responsible for 18 of the 45.5 
points the Florida men scored. 
Also on Day 2 of the champion-
ships, Holloway won his first indi-
vidual national championship. Hol-
loway ran the 60-meter hurdle finals in 7.58 seconds to become the sec-
ond freshman since 1999 to win an 
Indoor 60-meter hurdle title. 
Coach Holloway said the fresh-
man told him Friday night after he underperformed in the long jump fi-nal that he wouldn’t disappoint him 
on Saturday. 
“He was very focused today,” 
Holloway said in a release Saturday. 
“The whole goal today was execute 
the first three steps, get to the first 
hurdle and run away. That’s what 
he did.”
Although coach Holloway said 
he was impressed with the effort 
from his team over the weekend, he 
said UF not doing as well as it could 
have in some areas and disqualifi-
cation in the men’s 400-meter final 
hurt the team.
Fasasi originally scored 4 points 
for Florida by placing fifth in the 
400-meters but was disqualified due 
to some accidental bumping, losing 
four points for the Gators but adding 
one as Futch moved from sixth place 
to fifth. 
Although the disqualification 
came with some controversy, Hol-loway said he doesn’t want to take anything away from Texas A&M’s 
win.
“They came in here and did what 
they had to do. They’re the national 
champions,” Holloway said. “I’m going to put this on me and my staff. 
We just have to prepare a little bit 
better. I’m pleased with the overall 
effort. We just came up a little bit 
short today.” 
Up next for the Florida, a few 
members of the team will kick off their outdoor season at the UCF 
Black and Gold Challenge on March 
17-18.

Maria Torres and one of her play-
ing partners, UCF's Ashley Holder, 
joked with each other as they made 
the walk from the third hole to the fourth tee on the opening day of the SunTrust Gator Invitational on Sat-urday. 
On the par-5 third hole they had 
just finished, shouts of “sit!” and “get down!” and “bam!” erupted from both the players and the crowd 
that had gathered to watch Torres, 
the reigning SEC Player of the Year.
She and Holder both birdied the 
hole, but they took very different 
routes to the finish.“That really keeps you going,” 
Torres said of the chatting between 
holes. “It’s just competitive.”
That competitiveness helped Tor-
res lead UF to an 8-stroke victory over Duke. It also helped her set sev-eral Gators records along the way. 
Torres posted a 4-under-par sec-
ond round and shot 5 under for the tournament, both good for first in the tournament’s 45-year history. Overall, the Gators shot an 847, the 
best non-rain-shortened score since 
1974. Marta Perez and Taylor Tom-linson helped the cause, placing in ties for fourth and ninth, respec-tively.
Coach Emily Glaser said she was 
proud of the way her team and staff controlled things that they could and of the outcome it produced.
“I think the biggest difference 
maker was that we managed our 
emotions very well this week,” Gla-
ser said. “This is probably the most at-ease I’ve seen our team before teeing it up at a home event.”
That easy-going attitude shined 
through after a weather delay forced all teams off the course for 45 min-utes. While some teams stood under 
the awning at the Mark Bostick Golf 
Course, the Gators made their way inside, joked with each other and shared their experiences from play-ing on the course earlier in the day. 
After a grueling 36-hole day on 
a warm Saturday that gave UF a 7-stroke lead over Duke, the Gators didn’t let up, posting a 2-over-par team score on Sunday. Torres did the bulk of that work, hitting three 
consecutive birdies to start the back 
nine to finish off her 5-birdie second day.
“She’s very steady,” Glaser said 
of her senior golfer. “In that back nine (Sunday), she just put the ham-mer down…she hits a lot of greens, she’s always very steady, and when 
she gets the putter rolling, she can 
be a very good putter.”
On the 18th hole at Mark Bos-
tick stands a giant white scoreboard with the individual and team leaders 
facing out towards the fairway. It’s 
updated constantly by staffers who get updates radioed in every three holes. As Torres approached the green of the 18th on Day 2, her ball 
lying in the rough just to the left of 
the hole, she couldn’t help but look up at it.
“I like to see it,” Torres said. 
“You don’t get to see it by every 
single hole. You feel comfortable 
(when you see it), but you still want to finish good.”
Torres missed the putt for par 
after she chipped the ball within 10 
yards of the hole. But at that point, 
the bogie didn’t matter. She’d al-ready won.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — It was all 
hugs and smiles. 
Players celebrated, fans cheered, 
and blue and white confetti poured 
down from the rafters of Bridgestone Arena like a never-ending storm. 
With No. 8 Kentucky’s 82-65 win 
over Arkansas (25-9) on Sunday af-ternoon in the ﬁ  nal game of the SEC Tournament, the Wildcats proved once again that they are the con-ference’s most elite team. The win 
marked Kentucky’s third straight conference tournament champion-
ship and its 30th such title in pro-gram history. 
“This is a talented group,” UK 
coach John Calipari said. “I know they say there are other teams more talented. But I’ll take mine… 
. It should be a fun NCAA Tourna-ment.”    
However, despite its dominating 
performance in the last game before 
the start of the Big Dance, one thing remains clear: Kentucky (29-5) may own the SEC, but the conference’s other teams have loosened the Wild-
cats’ long-held vice grip over the 
league.
The Razorbacks were competitive 
through parts of Sunday’s game and even held a brief lead early in the opening half. And even with Ken-tucky in ﬁ  rm control for much of the second half, Arkansas fought back, going on a 15-3 run in a four-minute 
span to cut the score to 73-64.
In Saturday’s semiﬁ  nal game be-
tween UK and No. 5-seed Alabama, 
the Crimson Tide gave the Wildcats all they could handle in a physical, back-and-forth contest before run-ning out of gas in the game’s ﬁ  nal minute.
Seventh-seed Vanderbilt (19-15) 
may have had the biggest upset of the SEC Tournament. 
After dismantling Texas A&M the 
day prior, the Commodores went into overtime with second-seed Flor-ida (24-8) on Friday.
Vanderbilt outscored the Gators 
14-4 in the extra period to hand UF an exit in the tournament’s quarter-ﬁ  nals. It also gave the Commodores 
their third straight win over Florida 
this season.
“Each team in our league is 
good,” UF coach Mike White said following the loss. “I think (Vander-bilt is) the most improved team dur-ing the season in the league. They’ve come a long way.”
Following Sunday’s selection 
show, ﬁ  ve SEC teams — Kentucky, Florida, South Carolina, Arkansas and Vanderbilt — were selected to compete in March Madness. Only three teams made the tournament last season.
The Gators were named a No. 4 
seed and are set to play East Tennes-see State on Thursday in Orlando.
“This is the best this league has 
been since 2005,” Calipari said of the SEC. “Let’s see how we advance to see what this league really is.”
