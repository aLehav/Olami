Khila Frett said she came to Fla-
vet Field Tuesday to see “Gators” 
ﬁ  reworks.
The 5-year-old twirled a small 
American ﬂ  ag as she sat on a blan-ket with her mom, Thalia, 29.
Thousands packed picnics, Fris-
bees, footballs and blankets for a sunny afternoon on Flavet Field, where the UF College of Journalism and Communications hosted the Fanfares and Fireworks event. It has been a Gainesville tradition for about 15 years, said Randy Wright, executive director of the college’s division of multimedia properties.
Also contributing to the event’s 
$30,000 price tag were Gainesville Regional Utilities, the City of Gainesville, Florida Credit Union and Plum Creek, Wright said.
The event was canceled several 
times in recent years due to lack of funding, which made the large turnout even more worthwhile, Wright said.
“It far exceeded our expecta-
tions,” Wright said. “Mission ac-complished.”
Event-goers listened to live mu-
sic from the band shell stage, ate funnel cakes and donated blood.
By 8 p.m., Flavet Field was cov-
ered in red, white and blue T-shirts, blankets and decorations.
Amber Monk, 16, sported a red 
bandana tied around her head and an America-themed T-shirt she  found at Goodwill.
She and her sister, Ashley Monk, 17, have been coming to the July 3 event since they were kids.
“It’s always a good time,” said 
Ashley Monk, who will be a fresh-man at Florida State University in the fall.

A Gainesville man was arrested early 
Wednesday for allegedly robbing three 
people with a handgun and having a car key to a stolen vehicle, according to Gainesville Police.
Jo’Von Uriel Lake, 21, was charged with 
two counts of armed robbery, both ﬁ  rst-degree felonies; grand theft auto, a third-degree felony; and resisting arrest without violence, a ﬁ  rst-degree misdemeanor.
Police gave this account:At about midnight Wednesday, Lake,  
of Southwest 17th Lane, allegedly ap-proached Michael Moss, 37, Shelea Caesar, 29, and Mocu Leej Macrae, 35, in a parking lot at the 2000 block of Northeast Ninth Street, according to a GPD report.
Lake allegedly pulled out a .357-caliber 
handgun and threatened the victims.  “You know what time it is, give it up,” 
Lake is quoted in the re-port as saying to the vic-tims.
One of the men gave 
Lake $10 while the other victims said they did not 
have money or valuables on them. 
Lake ﬂ  ed from the 
scene.Shortly after the robbery, the victims 
contacted police and gave a description of Lake.
Moss said in an interview Wednesday  
there was a second person with Lake hid-ing in the bushes.
Police found Lake near one of the vic-
tim’s vehicles.
After he was discovered, Lake ﬂ  ed from 
police.
Police shouted at Lake multiple times 
to stop, but he allegedly refused and con-tinued running. Gainesville man arrested in connection with armed robbery

Got something going on?Dublin, Anglin said she did “the usual social network thing,” post-ing pictures of the dog on her Fa-cebook account and appealing for followers to spot him.
It wasn’t until after Patch 
waltzed on to the 6:49 a.m. com-muter train in Kilcock that the alarm was sounded.
Rail workers on board dubbed 
the dog Checker, joking he might be trained to inspect tickets, as commuters took turns petting the friendly dog. They turned him over to Pearse Street station staff on the train’s ﬁ  nal stop in the heart of the capital, when it became clear the dog had no owner on board.
Irish Rail spokesman Barry 
Kenny described Twitter as offer-ing the ideal platform for launch-ing a nationwide appeal for the lost dog. And he said some staff at Pearse Station wished it hadn’t worked so well.
“It was good she showed up so 
quickly, because the staff in the of-ﬁ  ce were getting quite attached to him,” Kenny said.
Anglin said she was particu-
larly pleased that Irish Rail posted Patch’s photo on Twitter and noted that the rapid retweets by other us-ers to their own followers ensured that, soon, the alert reached her.

Twitter helps find dog that took 
train to Dublin
DUBLIN — When Patch 
hopped aboard the train to Dub-
lin, it took the power of Twitter to reunite the dog with his owner.
Irish Rail sent a “Lost dog!” 
tweet with a photo after the Jack Russell terrier arrived with Wednesday morning commuters on a train from Kilcock, County Kildare, an hour’s ride away.
After more than 500 retweets 
in just 32 minutes, the photo found Patch’s owner, Deirdre Anglin, who tweeted the state railway: “That’s my dog!”
The episode underscored the 
ubiquitous use of mobile-friend-ly social media sites in Ireland, a tech-savvy corner of Europe where cell phones were the norm long before they were in the United States.

A Gainesville man was arrested 
for allegedly beating his pregnant 
girlfriend Wednesday morning.

She fought back.Washington said she bit and 
scratched Criger to get him off of her, according to the report.

Criger’s shoulder, a bite wound to his stomach, scratches on his back and a scratch inside his mouth.
Criger said he hit Washington 
because she started to bite him.

lice, but she said he smashed the phone against her head and took it away from her.

Police dispatch heard what 
sounded like the phone being taken from the female caller and being hung up, according to the report.

ington’s face was red and swollen in multiple places.Criger and Washington have 
been in a relationship for about a year. They lived together in the past, but now live separately , according to the report.

ington recently told him she was pregnant with his child, which she confirmed.
His bond is set at $20,000.Contact Ben Brasch at bbrasch@

Man arrested for allegedly beating pregnant girlfriendCRIME
� MOST OF THE GREATER 
SHEARWATER BIRDS ARE RELATIVELY YOUNG.
KELLY PRICE
Alligator Contributing Writer
On the east coast of Flori-
da, more than 250 birds have 
washed onto shores they’ve never seen. Now they’re in Gainesville, but they’ll never see that either.
Greater shearwater birds 
have been found dead on the east coast of Florida in places such as Fort Lauderdale and St. Augustine. This summer, they are being sent to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to be analyzed in Gainesville.
Dan Wolf, an avian veteri-
narian with the commission, examined the greater shearwa-ter birds’ carcasses.
Most of the dead birds are 
immature or less than a year old, Wolf said, but the species is not in danger of extinction.
“It’s unsettling,” he said. 
“Nobody likes to see dead birds. But as far as being highly unusual, I don’t think so.”
Greater shearwater birds 
are brown and gray and spot-ted and about the size of a typi-cal sea gull.
Forming a figure-eight-
shaped migration pattern from Canada to the British Isles to South America to the west coast of Africa, the birds glide over the Atlantic Ocean waves without a sound, said Andy Kratter, ornithology collections manager at the Florida Muse-um of Natural History.
Kratter said the young birds 
are simply running out of gas this year.
Hyta Mederer, a licensed re-
habilitator at the Florida Wild-life Hospital in Melbourne, said the clinic would receive greater shearwater birds that couldn’t stand or open their eyes. She described them as “drooping.”
“A normal, healthy bird is 
going to try to run away from you, bite or fly away ,” she said. “But these birds couldn’t do that.”
Mederer said the clinic rare-
ly sees this species of birds, but received 102 in June alone.
Kratter said it’s hard to pin-
point what the precise cause of the deaths is because so little is known about the birds’ feed-ing habits. They only come onto shore to nest in the Tristan de Cunha islands in the south Atlantic Ocean between South America and Africa.
“This is not like a one-
time thing,” he said. “Climate change or something like that can’t be blamed for this. This has to do with their food hab-its.”
Kratter also said more birds 
than usual may be washing ashore due to strong eastern winds in the area, which are pushing more greater shear -
water carcasses ashore.
Regardless of the cause of 
the birds’ death, some of the bodies will end up at the Flor -
ida Museum of Natural His-tory.
Kratter said 2005 was the 
last year the museum received a large number of greater shearwater birds for its collec-tion, when it received about 100 from bird rehabilitation clinics across Florida. In 2010, the museum received 14, and it received five last year.
Wolf said the average num-
ber of birds found dead is about 50 to 60, but he has seen more than 1,000 some years at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
This year, there have been 
more than 250 reported dead, he said.
Kratter estimated this year 
the museum would get about 50.Birds found dead on east 
coast sent to Gainesville for examination, display
Residents made up most of the crowd
On the periphery of Flavet Field sat Howard and 
Janet Plumley. She had her feet kicked up in a foldable 
chair, reading science fiction. He was sipping lemon-ade.
Howard Plumley, 64, who has worked at UF for 30 
years, said the couple has been to the event at least 12 times.
“It’s one of the best things we do for the commu-
nity,” he said with a smile.
It seemed more families than students took over Fla-
vet Field this year.
Chris Stewart, a 21-year-old aerospace engineering 
senior, said he was surprised to see more Gainesville residents and families than students attend the free event.“The fireworks were cool and all, but the best part 
was the band playing throughout,” Stewart said. “They even synced the music with the fireworks.”
People began waving hissing cans of bug spray as 
the sun started to sink behind the trees. Paper fans cooled the damp faces of mothers cradling sleepy chil-dren.
At around 9:40 p.m., a 15-minute firework show be-
gan bursting color into the night sky.

RALEIGH, N.C. — Andy Grif-
fith’s gift to the show that bore his 
name wasn’t just the homespun wisdom of the plain-spoken sheriff he played. It was the place he cre-ated: a small town where all foibles are forgiven and friendships are for -
ever, full of characters who felt like family.
Mayberry, a fictional North Car -
olina village said to be modeled on Griffith’s own hometown of Mount Airy, was so beloved that it practi-cally became a synonym for any community that was too innocent and trusting for real life. After all, Griffith’s Mayberry was a place where the sheriff didn’t carry a gun, the local drunk locked himself in jail and even the villains who passed through were changed by their stay.
On “The Andy Griffith Show,” 
he created an endearing portrait of a place where few people grew up but many wished they did.
Griffith, who died Tuesday at 86 
at his North Carolina home, played a sage widower named Andy Taylor who offered gentle guidance to son Opie, played by little Ron Howard, who grew up to become an Oscar-winning director. Griffith inhabited the sheriff’s “aw, shucks” persona so completely that viewers easily believed the character and the man were one.
“What made ‘The Andy Griffith 
Show’ work was Andy Griffith him-self — the fact that he was of this dirt and had such deep respect for the people and places of his child-hood,” said Craig Fincannon, who runs a casting agency in Wilming-ton and met Griffith in 1974.
A character on the show “might 
be broadly eccentric, but the char -
acter had an ethical and moral base that allowed us to laugh with them and not at them,” he said. “And Andy Griffith’s the reason for that.”
Don Knotts, who died in 2006, 
was the goofy Deputy Barney Fife, while Jim Nabors joined the show as Gomer Pyle, the cornpone gas pumper. George Lindsey, who died in May , was the beanie-wearing Goober. The sheriff’s loving Aunt Bee was played by the late Frances Bavier.
The show initially aired from 
1960 to 1968 and never really left television, living on for decades in reruns. Almost 20 years later, a re-union movie titled “Return to May-berry” was the top-rated TV movie of the 1985-86 season.
The series became one of only 
three in TV history to bow out at the top of the ratings (The others were “I Love Lucy” and “Seinfeld.”). Griffith said he decided to end it “because I thought it was slipping, and I didn’t want it to go down fur -
ther.”
In a 2007 interview with The Associated Press, Griffith said he wasn’t as wise as the sheriff or as nice. He described himself as hav-ing the qualities of one of his last roles, that of the cranky diner owner in “Waitress,” and also of his most manipulative character, from the 1957 movie “A Face in the Crowd.”
“But I guess you could say I cre-
ated Andy Taylor,” he said. “Andy Taylor’s the best part of my mind. The best part of me.”
Griffith also dabbled in Demo-
cratic politics, appearing in 2008 in an Obama campaign video directed by Howard and featuring the former child star chatting with Griffith and other former TV colleagues. Two years later, he made a commercial praising the president’s health care legislation.
Griffith was born June 1, 1926, 
and as a child sang and played slide trombone in the band at Grace Moravian Church. He studied at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and for a time con-templated a career in the ministry. But he eventually got a job teaching high school music in Goldsboro.
He and his first wife, Barbara Ed-
wards, had two children: Sam, who died in 1996, and Dixie. His second wife was Solica Cassuto. Both mar -
riages ended in divorce. He married third wife Cindi Knight Griffith in 1983.
Griffith also suffered from Guil-
lain-Barre syndrome, a rare neuro-logical disorder that can cause sud-den paralysis. He suffered a heart attack and underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2000.THURSDAY, JULY 5, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

That brings us to our we-now-ofﬁ  cially-declare-August-

First, in honor of Independence Day, we throw a let’s-not-
pretend-that-your-greatest-hits-album-would-have-more-than-one-song DART at Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the 
USA.” It’s a nice gesture, but that song is really one of the worst things ever composed.
Can we stop playing it every Fourth of July and/or patriotic 
celebration? Thanks.
Next up, we give a go-America-and-go-UF LAUREL to the 
16 current and former Gators who qualiﬁ  ed for the London Olympics.
Enjoy London and go for the gold.Although we all know now that Obamacare was upheld by 
the Supreme Court last week, we have to give a maybe-you-should-be-better-at-your-jobs-and-check-your-facts DART to 
CNN and eventually Fox News, who mistakenly reported that 
the individual mandate was found unconstitutional by SCO-TUS.
Nice one.Speaking of things everyone already knows, we give a it’s-
actually-kind-of-cool-that-no-one-is-surprised-or-upset LAU-
REL to Anderson Cooper, who ofﬁ  cially came out as being 
gay.
With little to no uproar, maybe this will inspire more public 
ﬁ  gures to be more open about their sexuality.
If you save someone’s life, that should be a good thing, 
right?
Not to the recipient of our it’s-time-to-reevaluate-your-busi-
ness-model-and-priorities DART at Jeff Ellis and Associates, 
an Orlando-based lifeguard company. Tomas Lopez, a life-guard for the company, saved a man from drowning but was ﬁ  red because he left the section of the beach that his company was paid to patrol.
The company argued that he broke the rules, potentially 
putting swimmers in his section at risk. Perhaps Jeff Ellis and Associates has never heard of exceptions or common human decency.
Finally, for a potentially huge scientiﬁ  c breakthrough, we 
give a where’s-Bill-Nye-the-Science-Guy-to-explain-to-us-what-they-found LAUREL to scientists at the Large Hadron 
Collider in Switzerland who believe they have found the Higgs boson, or the “God Particle.”
This particle is believed to help explain what gives objects 
mass, giving us more insight into the beginning of the uni-verse.
Pretty cool, huh?Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back

‘Moderation’ is not the key to independence
This Independence Day, as in years past, families 
and friends will gather together to barbecue, swim, play and enjoy ﬁ  reworks. The Fourth of July is the 
ultimate rite of summer for most Americans, and rightly so. Yet in the ﬂ  urry of activities that we all rush into, it can be easy to forget what the holiday truly commemorates.
Most people, if asked, would say July 4 is the birth date 
of our Republic. Technically they are correct, but for the founders who signed the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776 was merely the birth date of an idea.
The idea of a free and independent nation separate 
from the yoke of England existed only on paper that day. For them, the very act of signing such a document was treason, punishable by death, forfeiture of all their prop-erty and the imprisonment of their families. That these men knew the great risks they were taking is undeniable.
On April 19, 1775, less than 15 months beforehand, 
after being met with armed resistance at Lexington and Concord by colonial militia, the British proceeded to re-taliate by searching nearby homes for militia members and slaughtering everyone inside, including civilian women and children. These scenes of carnage were later described in all 37 colonial newspapers of the day. It is therefore inconceivable that each signer took his actions lightly.
These men suffered greatly for their actions. To say 
they were well outside of their comfort zones in essen-tially declaring a civil war against their fellow English-men would be a gross understatement. However, these men willingly pledged their very lives, fortunes and their sacred honor to the founding of our nation.
Fast forward to the present day and we see a very dif-
ferent caliber of statesmen at the helm of our nation. One would likely be hard pressed to ﬁ  nd many politicians who have ever so much as lifted a ﬁ  nger to serve our na-tion beyond their own personal or political interests.
I see a few men and women of principle who love their nation and try to act in its best interest. 
However, I ﬁ  nd the major-
ity of our national leadership seems composed of self-serving, power-hungry individuals with no stomach for sacriﬁ  ce, humil-ity or duty.
Those who claim to be rock 
solid in their convictions during their campaigns are al-most always embarrassingly ﬂ  exible when it comes to their parties’ lines on any given position. Today, more than any time in recent memory, the term “moderate” has been bandied about as some sort of new political virtue.
It is one thing to ﬁ  nd oneself in the ideological center 
of things, perhaps believing strongly in speciﬁ  c positions from both sides of the spectrum. That is not the same as being a “moderate.” A moderate in today’s American body is merely someone who will embrace certain val-ues and positions in order to achieve his or her ofﬁ  ce, but who will bend and sway with whatever winds of political expediency that will allow his or her tenure to be an easy one.
Essentially, to be a moderate is to stand for nothing but 
one’s own interests. Sadly, their ranks are growing.
Our nation wasn’t founded by moderate men. It would 
not exist today if it was. As we again mark Independence Day, let us remember the founders and their convictions, and demand more of our statesmen than petty and “mod-erate” mediocrity, whatever our political persuasions may be.
If we stand for anything, let us stand ﬁ  rmly then. The 
moderates will follow as they always do.

Joshua Fonzi
opinions@alligator.org THURSDAY, JULY 5, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 7
I recently read the column “President Obama displays in-
competence,” by Alligator columnist Joshua Fonzi. With all due respect to the author, this column is highly typical 
of the “things are bad and no matter who made them bad, blame Obama” argument.
The fact is that Republicans have been obstructing every-
thing President Obama has tried to do, and this is more the “John Boehner Economy” than the “Obama Economy.”
President Obama, for instance, has a job bill that would 
create four million jobs, but Republicans have blocked nearly every part of it.
Last month, the unemployment numbers went back up 
even as the private sector continued to create more jobs. How is that possible? Because state and local governments led by Republicans are laying off workers like there’s no tomor -
row.
Fonzi mentioned how Obama was using taxpayer money 
to travel to more campaign events than Bush did. Perhaps the author was unaware that Obama has already reimbursed more campaign travel expenses than Bush did in all eight years as president — that’s not something you’d hear on Fox News.
While we’re on the topic of jobs and Obama’s perfor -
mance, does the author remember the promise that the stim-ulus bill would prevent unemployment from going above 8 percent? Well, as it turns out, we were already at 9 percent unemployment when the Congressional Budget Office made that prediction.
Every month, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics comes out with an initial es-timate of unemployment, then half-
way through the month, it comes out with a revised estimate. We were between the initial and revised estimates when the Congressional Budget Office made that statement.
I guess we don’t hear that too often because it’s not great 
politics to say, “Oh, we were wrong because we didn’t even know how high unemployment was in the first place,” but those are the facts.
Fonzi also mentioned that Romney may not be wonder -
ful, but that he knows how to use a calculator and balance a budget. When Romney ran Bain Capital, the company would buy out failing and struggling companies and “make them profitable” by firing a quarter of the workers and lowering pay and benefits, while also using outsourced labor.
Recently, Romney tried to defend his record by saying 
there’s a difference between “outsourcing” (which he defines as firing American workers and moving their jobs overseas) and “offshoring” (which he defines as creating new jobs overseas instead of creating them here).
Every time Obama talks about giving tax breaks to com-
panies for not outsourcing, Romney says he “doesn’t want to pick winners and losers,” so I think it’s clear that Romney’s record of outsourcing at Bain Capital reflects how he would govern as president.In sum, if Obama were our king, Fonzi would be 100 per -
cent correct. But Obama is not a king; he’s a president who has limited power and must deal with representatives whose No. 1  priority is to make him a one-term president rather than work together to create jobs for American workers.
Finally, for full disclosure, I will admit that I too am a 
lifelong Republican. However, I am horrified by the extreme hardcore fiscal conservatism that has become popular with the Tea Party.
I never thought I’d hear people like Michelle Bachmann or 
Dick Morris say that it would be OK for the U.S. to  not raise the debt ceiling and be in technical default. According to this new extreme fiscal conservatism, as long as we pay for the in-terest on the national debt, fund the military and keep social security solvent, everything else can remain unfunded.
I never dreamed my party would come out with the pro-
posed Ryan Budget that block-grants Medicaid back to the states with such large cuts, it practically ends the program. It also virtually turns Medicare into a voucher program, mak-ing the average senior citizen pay $6,000 more per year. (Yes, I know the Ryan Budget has a $6,125 voucher for poor senior citizens, but only for extremely poor senior citizens.)
I agree with Jeb Bush — I can’t even reorganize my own 
party anymore!

In today’s world, notable sto-
ries are often limited to 140-char-
acter tweets, two- to three-sen-tence Facebook statuses and/or text messages of a socially acceptable length. Gainesville’s ﬁ  rst community Internet radio station, Grow Radio, would rath-er give a person ﬁ  ve minutes, a stage and an audience.
The Conch is a monthly story-
telling event hosted at Lightnin’ Salvage in Satchel’s Pizza. Its name is derived from the sym-bolic conch shell used in “Lord of the Flies” to indicate who has the right to speak. The second Tues-day of every month at 7 p.m., the ﬁ  rst of which begins July 10, Gainesville residents are invited to come share a true story based on the theme of that month or to simply sit and listen.
Those interested in speaking 
will put their names in a hat upon arrival. If selected, they will be given ﬁ  ve minutes to share his or her story. Grow Radio will record every performance and choose the best ones to broadcast later in the month.
Bill Bryson, 46, is the founder 
and general manager of Grow Radio, a nonproﬁ  t he started three years ago. Bryson said the idea was partly inspired by radio programs he enjoys such as “The Moth,” “This American Life” and “Radiolab.”
“There are a lot of great sto-
rytelling based kinds of pro-gramming, and that’s where the strength of radio comes from,” Bryson said.
For Bryson, the main goal of 
many of his endeavors, and es-pecially The Conch, is the idea of inclusion.
“I want to help ﬁ  nd people 
common ground that they didn’t know was there,” he said.
Down the road Bryson said he 
hopes to bring in members of the community for workshops. He is excited to see people’s story-telling techniques improve over time.
Although Bryson is, by his 
own admission, not a great sto-ryteller. He feels there are many great stories and storytellers alike in Gainesville who come from all walks of life. He said they are reaching out to and expecting participation from many parts of the community, not just from the university.
True to the occasion, the 
theme of the event’s launch will be, “There’s a First Time for Ev-erything.”

A local soap-making business, Thrive Handcrafts, recently teamed 
up with a local coffee business, Sweetwater Organic Coffee Roasters, 
to create a soap that will leave java junkies feeling squeaky clean.
Susan Niemann, a stay-at-home mom and licensed massage ther-
apist, began making soaps because she wanted to know the exact ingredients she was putting on her daughter’s and her own body.
In two years, her hobby quickly expanded into a successful busi-
ness that distributes soap to locally owned stores in Gainesville.
The Niemanns drink Sweetwater Coffee at home.  When she real-
ized soap could be made out of coffee, she began experimenting and brought her perfected product to Sweetwater. The company was ea-ger to collaborate with her.
Thrive Handcrafts’ soaps sealed with the Sweetwater logo are 
sold  at Ward’s Supermarket and will soon arrive in other local stores.
Niemann’s other soaps, body scrubs, deodorant and balms can 
also be found at Ward’s, Citizens Co-op, Florida School of Massage, The Green House Nursery, Garden Gate Nursery and Earth Pets, and she is continually partnering with more local businesses.
Niemann said she bought handmade soap at a craft festival years 
ago and loved the idea of buying it from the hands that made it.
She didn’t want to use Johnson & Johnson on her baby because 
it had petroleum products. She wasn’t comfortable putting mineral oils or unpronounceable ingredients on her daughter.
From an environmental perspective, she also wanted to feel com-
fortable with what she was putting down the drain.
“If there is any small way that I can make a statement,” Niemann 
said, “even if it’s with a bar of soap, I’m going to make it.”
Her soaps contain natural products and are made from scratch. 
There are no dyes or animal fats, and if animal products such as hon-ey or goat’s milk are used, it is in the title so nothing is hidden.
Palm oil is a popular ingredient in soaps but Niemann refuses 
to use it in hers since the oil palm is grown in the rainforest and she does not condone crops destruction.  
She uses herbs from her own garden to scent the soaps such as 
lemongrass, mint and rosemary.
“I wanted it to smell like the real thing,” she said, “not like a 
chemically recreated scent.”
A Thrive Handcrafts soap may cost double that of a bar of Ivory 
soap, but it is guaranteed to contain natural ingredients as well as support the local economy.
She said if someone buys a bar of her soap at Ward’s then she 
makes money, Ward’s makes money and then she ends up spending the money she made at Ward’s so it stays in town.
Niemann thinks people are realizing that when 
you buy locally you can help feed a family on your block.
 Niemann is starting to 
collaborate with local breweries to create a beer soap. 
“I laugh at myself 
sometimes when I act like a bar of soap can change the world,” she said. “But in reality I really feel like it can do its part to help.”Massage therapist sells

It’s the ﬁ  rst day of elemen-
tary school. Some children are 
scared of letting go of Mom’s hand, some are excited to make new friends. Others are anx-ious about getting their peers to accept their physical differ-ences, which is why novelist Shelley Fraser Mickle started Wild Onion Press.  
The Gainesville-based com-
pany publishes books starring children with physical differ-ences.
“It is a hard thing to do to 
try to get the general public to embrace physical differences,” Mickle, 68, said. “No one wants to go there.”
Mickle had polio as a child 
and was paralyzed from the waist down, causing her to wear leg braces. While writing about her experiences growing up in her memoir, “The Polio Hole,” she realized there was a gap in the publishing world. There were few books featur-ing children with differences, and through this revelation, Wild Onion Press was born.
“I was pretty outraged 
when I thought about how few books feature children with physical differences in heroic roles,” she said. “They’re usu-ally objects of pity. They’re ob-jects in which someone comes forward to save them and we need to reverse it.”The company has published 
10 books since it was founded in April 2009, the most recent called “The First Day Speech,” by Isabelle Hadala. Hadala was born with ectodermal dys-plasia, a condition that halts the development of ﬁ  ngers, teeth and toes. On her ﬁ  rst day of ﬁ  rst grade, Hadala gave a speech to her classmates, encouraging them to “take a good look at her and get over it,” as Mickle said.“So that bravery and that 
spunk really touched me,” Mickle said. “I’ve held onto that whole idea for a long time.”
Mickle could be a character 
in one of her company’s books, turning her polio struggle into a memoir, writing acclaimed novels and now starting Wild Onion Press, an endeavor she’s found to be the most reward-ing accomplishment. 
“I’ve had a movie made, a New York Times notable book and all these wonderful things, but none of that has measured up to how this makes me feel,” Mickle said. “What I’m doing in this last chapter of my career is giving me more satisfaction than I’ve ever had.”
The publishing company’s 
bestseller, “The Gift of Grace,” by Grace Mary McClelland, is about a girl with a congeni-tal hand difference. Another book, “Jason and Elihu,” by Mickle, was added to the Just Read, Florida! Summer Read-ing List.
The books are currently 
sold in Alachua and Marion county Publix stores. Also Fol-lett, an educational distribu-tor, included the company in its business, a step closer to Mickle’s goal to get the books into every school and national public library.
“What we want to do is get 
into schools where we will make lasting change of the cul-ture, of perceptions of physical differences,” Mickle said.
Mickle got to see the 
change begin in a kindergar-ten class when she read “The Gift of Grace” to it. There was a 5-year-old girl missing her right hand listening intently to a story about a heroine named Grace just like her.
“You could just see her 
ﬂ  ower,” Mickle said. “By shar-ing their story they become more than their physical pres-ence. They become the spirit for change.” THURSDAY, JULY 5, 2012  ALLIGATOR, 9

Parking.
One simple word conjures up thoughts 
of one of the most frustrating aspects of student life.
However, it is an issue that affects more 
than just students in Gainesville.
A lack of parking forced Swamp Drag-
on, a locally owned and operated tobacco and gift shop, to relocate.
Swamp Dragon moved from 1221 W. 
University Ave. to 818 W. University Ave. on June 9. The new shop is between Taco Bell and Bodytech Tattoo and Piercing.
Clay Houghland, owner, said that al-
though there were a variety of reasons for the move, parking was by far the most im-portant one.
The previous location had only four 
parking spots for customers. Houghland said he was constantly guarding the spots. At the new location that is not a problem.
The new Swamp Dragon shop is four 
times larger than the previous one, which was 600 square feet. The space will allow the store to expand its repertoire of items. Houghland said he hopes that in the future such items will include T-shirts and furni-ture, some of which he creates.
In spite of the move, Houghland said he 
has seen the number of customers remain consistent. He expects an increase by two or three times this during fall.  
Drew Smittle, an employee at Swamp 
Dragon said he loves the atmosphere and how respectful the customers are.
“I think this is one of the best shops in 
the world,” he said.Swamp

After 14 years, non profit record store and venue Wayward 
Council is closing. The final show is tonight at 9 p.m.
NATALIE TEER

The smell of sweat and body odor 
lingers in the small two-room re-
cord store.  Boxes are in piles strewn about the floor, and a dusty P .A. sys-tem rests in the corner, waiting to be used.
Nonprofit record store and music 
venue Wayward Council is closing its doors after 14 years. 
There will be a farewell show 
Thursday featuring more than five bands. The event is $5 and will begin at 9 p.m.
“It kind of ends when it ends,“ 
said Gabrielle Keane, a 23-year-old Wayward Council volunteer.
Wayward Council is completely 
volunteer based — Keane has been involved for about eight months, and there are roughly 15 other vol-unteers. There is no set schedule. All workers have keys and put their names down on available time slots.  
Matt Sweeting, the remaining co-
founder, reminisced as he loaded boxes.    
“The first day, I remember there 
was a line to get in. We had so many people that wanted to shop that we had to give people numbers,” he said. “I was sitting there with a core of people, they were all freaking out, and I said ‘I told you’.”
Wayward’s goal is to have every-
thing cleared out by Thursday for the show and be officially out of the space by Monday when keys will be 
turned in.
The merchan-
dise, which includes books, stickers, magazines, records, patches, tapes, CDs and T-shirts, are be-
ing sold and donated throughout the week. The items were a broad range of local art and music, objects from touring bands and older music dat-ing anywhere from the 1960s to the 1990s.
“A lot of things are on the free 
table, the rest will eventually be do-nated,” said Keane. “Other things are going to be stored in case there is another project similar to this start-ed, that way there will already be a stock.”
Wayward also collected items for 
Books to Prisoners, an organization that gives donated books to incarcer -
ated residents. Keane said the repre-sentative for the organization could not be reached. The accumulation of books will be stored for a month, and if no one claims them the books will be donated to the Friends of the Library.
Keane foresees the show being 
packed with people coming from out of town and those wanting to be a part of the last show.
“It’s going to be cool visually and 
acoustically to be empty, its never been empty in here before,” she said.
Sweeting posed under a skylight 
for a photo holding Polaroid’s of the other three co-starters of Wayward Council. “I am the only one left, so I thought I would do a little re-union.”

 SEATTLE — At this point, Mike 
Zunino just wants to get through the 
whirlwind of being honored for his college career so his pro career can begin.
  It’s coming very soon for the Se-
attle Mariners’ latest top prospect.
  “It’s very surreal,” Zunino said. 
“I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a little kid and I’m just ex-tremely thrilled to have this oppor-tunity . ... I’m just looking forward to playing and making an impact.”The Mariners introduced Zunino on Tuesday , a day after the No. 3 overall pick in June’s amateur draft signed his contract with Seattle. And within the next two weeks, Zunino is likely to be making his pro debut playing for Single-A Everett in the North-west League.
  That’s a signiﬁ  cant change from 
previous years when it was rare for top prospects to sign in enough time to get shipped off for some school-ing in the minors before the end of the season. Changes in the collective bargaining agreement moved up the signing deadline and made locking up draft picks simpler for clubs. The result for Seattle is that Zunino could get about six weeks of minor-league experience that will only help in the process of trying to get him one step closer to the majors.
  “You look at the amount of guys 
we’ve already signed, the number we had signed in the ﬁ  rst week, I do think the new CBA had an awful lot to do with that,” general manager Jack Zduriencik said. “In terms of this particular player, Mike he want-ed to get out and play . He was like, ‘Hey , I’m ready to go. You took me (No.) 3 in the country , I’m ready to start my career.’”
  Zunino’s trip to Seattle this time 
was brief and included taking in a couple of games at what he hopes is his home park someday and signing his contract. He’ll be off this week-end to the Golden Spikes Award cer-emonies, where Zunino is a ﬁ  nalist for the award given to the top col-lege player. After that comes a trip to the All-Star Game in Kansas City , Mo.
  And that travel is after Zunino 
has already made a pair of trips to the Midwest to accept the Dick Howser Trophy and Johnny Bench Award for his stellar college career at Florida.

  Billy Heywood is braver than most. Portrayed by Luke 
Edwards in the 1994 ﬁ  lm Little Big League, Billy inherits the Minnesota Twins after the death of his grandfather, 
the team’s owner. One week later, Billy names himself man-ager.
  One of the most captivating scenes in the movie comes 
when Billy has to cut his favorite player, Jerry Johnson, mid-season. Billy tries to cheer his hero up by saying he refused to trade his Johnson baseball card to a friend for Wade Boggs and Sammy Sosa cards. Naturally, this did not make the sud-denly unemployed ballplayer feel any better.
  In essence, saying goodbye is never easy, especially to a 
childhood idol. However, it is a stark reality that I, along with millions of boys that have grown up playing base-ball in Georgia, will have to face when Chipper Jones calls it quits at the end of the 2012 campaign.
  This season has not been easy — ac-
tually, far from it.
  Instead of watching my favorite 
baseball player suit up every night on 
TBS like I did when I was younger, I watch the Braves play on my MacBook and curse MLB.TV every time it buffers.
  I cherish my remaining time with Chipper, and I’m not 
happy when an unreliable Internet connection interferes with the last baseball season of my childhood. However, the in-consistent connectivity is not the only thing to blame.
  The injury bug has taken a chunk out of Chipper’s season 
once again in 2012. Since 2004, Jones has missed 348 games due to resting and ailments ranging from his hamstrings to  Chipper’s ﬁ  nal    
selection to All-Star

 Football didn’t always come easy for 
James Hearns.
  The Lincoln (Tallahassee, Fla.) lineback-
er couldn’t ﬁ  nd playing time as a young 
player who preferred the hardwood to the football ﬁ  eld.
Hearns rode the bench as one of the 
youngest players on his team due to his weight.  It all changed once he suited for the Lin-
coln Trojans.
  “When I got to Lincoln and played, that’s 
when I started to realize I had a chance,” he said.
  Hearns transformed into an Army All-
American nominee and a state champion.
  Although the 6-foot-3, 260-pound behe-
moth tore his left ACL eight months ago, he participated in summer 7-on-7 tourna-ments with Lincoln and can’t wait for his senior season.  “I can’t even explain it,” Hearns said. 
“I’m just so ready to get back out there. I feel like it’s been too long.”
  While Hearns ex-
pects his Lincoln team, loaded with prospects such as four-star wide 
receivers Reggie Davis and Taj Williams, to ﬁ  nish undefeated, the rising senior has even higher expectations for the Florida 2013 recruiting class.
  “You could be that class and come in and make an impact,” Hearns said.
“To bring this program back to national 
status would be something that would stick with you for a lifetime. You could be re-sponsible for bringing in the next national championship.”
  It’s not all about football for the outspo-
ken future Gator who took into account more than just the opportunity to play in the Southeastern Conference.
  “I like the fact that [UF] is not just known 
for athletics, but it is known academically too,” Hearns said. “Once you graduate and actually have to get a job in the real world  Florida linebacker commit Hearns eager to return from ACL tearSEE BASEBALL, PAGE 20SEE JOE, PAGE 19

He also became the second player in team history to make 100 or more 3-pointers in a season, including a 34-game streak with at least one made.

an ACL tear in 2010. Extensive time on the DL has like-
ly robbed Chipper of additional All-Star selections and milestones such as 3,000 hits and 500 home runs.
  Despite the injuries, Chipper’s numbers still stand 
strong among Hall-of-Fame switch hitters and third base-men. He is a ﬁ  rst-ballot guy and there is no argument there.
  So, due to my constantly buffering MLB.TV feed and 
Chipper’s physical predicaments, I have enjoyed my fa-vorite ballplayer in small doses this summer.
  A walk-off home run in a 15-13 Braves win against the 
Phillies on May 2. Chipper’s 5-for-5 line against the Cubs on Tuesday.
  However, barring a major injury, base hits and home 
runs will come off Chipper’s bat several more times be-fore the season is over. But when National League man-ager Tony La Russa added Chipper to the All-Star team Tuesday afternoon, I got a little choked up.
  This is it for Larry Wayne Jones, Jr. Chipper will suit 
up for his ﬁ  nal All-Star Game in the only MLB city he has never visited as a player — Kansas City, Mo. — July 10.
 I’m sure I will get this emotional again when the Braves 
play the Mets in New York for the ﬁ  nal time (Laaaaaarry!) and when I go to Chipper’s home ﬁ  nale at Turner Field on Sept. 30.
  In the end, I will be happy.  Countless careers conclude in injury, the minor leagues 
or on waiver wires, and it’s simply unfortunate. Unlike Billy Heywood, I get to see my baseball hero leave the game with his head held high.
  The Braves are in the playoff hunt, and Chipper is a 
major contributor to the effort. Atlanta is 27-19 when the 40-year-old third baseman laces up his cleats and plays.
  Chipper is getting the Hall-of-Fame victory lap — in-
cluding several touching tributes in opposing team’s ball-parks — he deserves in his ﬁ  nal season. Sure, I could tell Mr. Jones that I wouldn’t trade his baseball card for one million Wade Boggs cards, but that just wouldn’t be fair.
Another World Series title excluded, there’s already 
enough icing on the cake.

Mike Zunino bats against North Carolina State during the NCAA Super Regional on June 10. In the Gators’ 9-8 victory against 
the Wolfpack, Zunino went 2 for 4 with a run scored and one RBI. The win sent Florida to the College World Series.
Zunino led the Gators in six offensive categories in 2012
Zunino hasn’t played since June 18 when the Gators 
were eliminated from the College World Series and the 
break — despite all the travel — has been welcome. Zunino played 66 games his junior season for the Gators and hit .322 with 19 homers and 67 RBIs. The homers and RBIs are equal to his sophomore season when Zunino was the Southeastern Conference player of the year.
It’ll be about a month between his final game with the 
Gators and his likely debut in the Mariners farm system.  
“It’s exciting to know there is room for advancement but that is up to these guys here and to myself. I need to go out and play well and prove to them that I’m ca-pable of playing at the highest level,” Zunino said.
Zduriencik is not putting a timeline on how quickly 
Zunino will be moved through the Mariners farm sys-tem. Seattle has a history of struggling to find catchers in the draft, either giving up on them too soon (Jason Varitek) or having them bust (former first-round pick Jeff Clement).
Zunino was just the third catcher ever taken in the 
first round by the Mariners.
“That is the most challenging position on the field. ... 
The thing we really liked about this particular player is he has all those other types of skills it takes,” Zduriencik said. “He’s a good receiver, he’s smart, he’s intelligent, he called his own game in college. His college coaches had great confidence in him so from our standpoint we think he’s going to be a little more advanced.”BASEBALL , from page 17
Hearns to attend UF camp in July
being a UF graduate doesn’t look too bad 
on your resume.”
He committed to the Gators in Febru-
ary, but his potential journey to Gainesville took a comical turn last month when he grabbed national headlines while at a foot-ball camp at hometown Florida State.
Hearns announced via his Twitter (@
JamesHearns21) on June 16: “I just got ejected for throwing up the gator chomp at Fsu camp.” 
The Gator chomp and tweet created a 
media firestorm, which surprised Hearns, but taught him a lesson.
“When I initially tweeted that, I never 
meant for any of that to happen,” he said.
This Florida commit is ready to put the 
recruiting process behind him and prepare for Gainesville.“You can just focus on yourself as a 
person and as a team, which really helps a lot to get stuff together your senior year before you’re off in the real world by your -
self.”
Hearns plans on visiting the Gators’ 
Friday Night Lights camp July 27.
“That’s the next camp 
I will be at for sure,” he said. “I don’t know about anything else.”
What Hearns does 
know is that the oppo-sition should watch out 
for his return to the field. 
As for what he’ll say to the quarter -
backs next season, Hearns said: 
“It probably wouldn’t be suitable for 
an interview, but I definitely have some words for you.”RECRUIT , from page 17
