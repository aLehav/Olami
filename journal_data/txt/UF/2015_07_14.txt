Behind the Confederate soldier 
statue on the corner of Main Street 
and East University Avenue on Thursday, a crowd of protesters held signs that read, “End white suprema-
cy” and “Tear it down.”
On the other side, counter-pro-
testers waved the southern battle ﬂ  ag 
— a recent center of national debate.
The topic sprung as a result of 
an organized protest to relocate the 111-year-old Confederate monument that stands in front of the govern-
ment-owned Alachua County Ad-
ministration Building, located at 12 SE First St.
“It should not be on government 
property. It could go into a museum. It can go into private property,” said Gwendolyn Simmons, a UF assistant professor of religion. “I don’t want to see it destroyed, but it should not be 
on government property that repre-
sents all the people.”
The rally drew about 100 people 
with conﬂ  icting views, prompt-ing heated debate while remain-ing peaceful under the watch of the Gainesville Police Department.
“Hey, hey! Ho, ho! These racist 
whites have got to go,” chanted the group supporting the relocation.
Non-supporters believe the mon-
ument doesn’t represent racism but instead pays honor to the fallen Civil War soldiers for their bravery.
“It’s not about slavery or states’ 
rights or any of that stuff; it’s for 
the average person who picked up 
and left his farm and went off to war,” said 20-year veteran James Shillinglaw, the northeast Florida heritage defense coordinator. “To-day we can argue about the war, but you can’t argue about the bravery of CONFEDERATE CONTROVERSY
GENERAL ADMISSION 
TICKETS ARE $15.

Gator Growl 2015 tickets are now on sale 
online and in-person on Turlington Plaza.
For $30, students have the option of buy-
ing a pit pass, which will allow them to 
watch the performances in the area closest to the stage. Student general admission tick-ets are $15.
Maddie Daugherty, the Gator Growl event 
producer, said the pit is an exclusive area. The advantage of the pit pass is people don’t have to show up as soon as the event starts to get close to the stage.
Gator Growl plans to announce this year’s 
performers by the end of Summer, Daugh-
erty said. 
“My freshman year I went because of the 
music group,” said Haley Bross, a 20-year-
old UF biomedical engineering junior. “I’m looking forward to going if they have a good 
group.”
During Summer B, tickets can be pur-
chased on Turlington Plaza from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays and from 11 
a.m. to 1 p.m. on Thursdays. Tickets are also being sold at Freshman Preview Orientation and the Transfer Student Resource Fair.
Non-student tickets are $49 for the pit 
pass and $24 for general admission. 
The event will be held Friday, Nov. 6. 
This will be the second year in a row that Gator Growl will be held on Flavet Field in-
stead of the Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.

Reid Hall maintenance workers 
brought balloons, a card and two 
stuffed tigers to Michelle Molden-Sevison.
The tigers were the ﬁ  rst items 
her daughter, UF psychology alum-na Gabriella Molden, held when she was strong enough to do so.
On June 15, Molden, 22, was 
riding her scooter without a hel-met to work at UF Health Shands Hospital. She suffered a traumatic brain injury when she was hit by a turning vehicle at the intersection 
of Museum Road and Southwest 
13th Street.
But now, four weeks after her 
accident, Gabby is able to Face-Time her sorority sisters and hug her family.
Molden-Sevison saw her daugh-
ter make small, day-by-day gains from the beginning.
“She has surprised the doctors,” 
she said. “She hasn’t surprised me.”
The tigers are one of the tokens 
that reminds Molden-Sevison of the “kindness of strangers,” she 
said.
“Every time I see her grab that 
little tiger, you know, I think of 
that moment when they knocked on the door with those for her,” Molden-Sevison said.
First, Gabby squeezed the ti-
gers. Then, she mouthed “I love you.”  
And now, she laughs at inside 
jokes with UF alumna Kayla Hale, her roommate from sophomore to senior year.“She’s like a living miracle,” 
said Hale, who was one of Gabby’s UF Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority 
sisters.
      
Gabby’s mom said her daugh-
ter loves life. She describes her as 
beautiful, vibrant, lively, deter-
mined, faithful.
“She’s the sparkle in my eye,” 
Molden-Sevison said.
She has spent the past four 
weeks at her daughter’s side, 
sleeping in Reid Hall for a couple of those weeks.
Steele Sevison, Gabby’s 10-year-
old brother, told his mom she had 
perfect attendance.
Steele has stayed with his sister 
and mom almost the entire time 
Gabby has been in the hospital. His other siblings, 24-year-old Garris Molden and 14-year-old Seaira Se-vison, visited their sister, too.
The only photo Molden-Sevison 
said she felt compelled to take in 
the ﬁ  rst days following the accident 
was when Gabby’s siblings sur-rounded her.
Molden-Sevison said her daugh-
ter had dreams of being a physi-cian assistant. Gabby also planned on using her medical experience to help those on a mission trip to Panama this summer.
Gabby’s little sister, Seaira, 
looks up to her as a role model, and she is following in her footsteps, UF alumna Gabby

The door to Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority 
house stood open Saturday night, welcoming 
guests to Pray for Gabby.
Girls in sundresses and boys in button-ups 
moseyed in, introducing friends of friends 
to one another and grabbing one another in hugs.
More than 150 of Gabby’s sorority sisters, 
friends and loved ones ﬁ  led into the chapter room.
An electronic tea-light candle sat on every 
seat.
The event celebrated Gabby’s recovery, 
said Samantha Coughlin, the Kappa Kappa Gamma president.
“She’s doing so well,” said Coughlin, who 
helped plan the service. “It’s inspiring.”
As attendees quieted down, bells sounded 
the start of the service.
Then voices joined the bells.  “Hallelujah,” the people sang.Afterward, songs of praise and scripture 
readings ﬁ  lled the room, where the Rev. Har-ry Holloman called attendees to voice spoken prayers. He told them to use “many words but one voice.”
While praying and praising, attendees 
passed around a silver pendant, thinking posi-tive thoughts as they did so.
The circular pendant was decorated with 
a butterﬂ  y that symbolizes new life. The but-
terﬂ  y perched on a branch that was bent, but 
not broken, which the Rev. Rachel DeLaune said represents Gabby’s struggle.
The service also included Bible passages 
about strength, speciﬁ  cally those from the book of Isaiah.
Pictures of Gabby played on a TV at the 
front of the room, and Holloman explained why he chose one of Gabby’s arms out-stretched as she was skydiving.
In the photo, Holloman said Gabby is the 
closest one could come to being so full of 
strength that he or she soars like an eagle, cit-
ing Isaiah 40:31.
“Because we hurt, we can ﬁ  nd strength,” 
Holloman said.
At the end of the service, attendees were 
asked to stand up, turn on their candles and hold them high.
      
Molden-Sevison said she felt the prayers 
for her daughter.
“The power of prayer is so beautiful and so 
strong,” she said.
Molden-Sevison said the outpouring of 
love and prayers from friends and strangers alike are meaningful to her.
One of those who came to the event to 
show support for Gabby was Sgt. Nick Ko-nopka from the University Police Department, who responded to the accident.
He said it makes him sick to see a UF stu-
dent or graduate hurt because he cares about them like they are his own children.
“It’s still somebody’s baby somewhere,” 
said Konopka, who has been working for UPD for 27 years.
      
When Molden-Sevison crosses the inter-
section where her daughter was hit, she said 
she holds her breath.
But when she heads north on Southwest 
13th Street, she said she sees the support for 
Gabby on the outside of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and Alpha Gamma Rho fra-ternity houses.  The sorority sisters and fra-ternity brothers hung banners with words of encouragement outside.
When she isn’t at her daughter’s side at 
the hospital, Molden-Sevison said she likes to drive by, just to look at them.
She said she hopes sharing her daughter’s 
story and encouraging people to use helmets will spare other families the pain she has en-dured.
“You’ve worked so hard getting where 
you’re at,” Molden-Sevison said. “Don’t let an 
instant take it away from you.”PRAY,  from pg 1Her sorority held a Pray for Gabby event Saturday night

these people.”
Meanwhile, Faye Williams, who 
organized the event, thinks her re-
quest is reasonable. The organizers’ plan is to move the statue off gov-ernment property and into Mathe-son Museum, which was built on the grounds where the Battle of Gainesville was fought in August 1864. 
While Williams hopes the costs 
of moving can be covered with do-nations from local businesses, some worry facilitating the relocation won’t be as easy as it seems.
Micah Hedgecock said the piece 
of history should stay in its place.
“This is a historical marker,” he 
said, “and if for no other reason, it should remain as a reminder of the progress that has been made as a so-ciety.”
One of the statue’s inscription 
reads, “They fell for us, and for them should fall the tears of a nation’s 
grief.”
“I think it’s very important to ask 
who that ‘us’ is,” said Jesse Arost, co-
organizer of the event.PROTEST,  from pg 1Some suggest the statue be moved into the Matheson Mu seum

A union has filed a grievance, or com-
plaint, against UF for increasing graduate 
assistants’ health insurance dependents’ pre-miums by more than 20 percent without dis-cussion.
The changes, which were implemented 
July 1, violated the contract between the Graduate Assistants United union and UF that wasn’t allowed to be changed until 2017 un-less UF sat down with a representative from the union, said Lia Merivaki, the co-president of the union.
UF increased the premium for GatorGrad-
Care, the health insurance provided by UF for 
graduate students, by 22.8 percent.
The changes affect new and re-enrolling 
graduate, research and teaching assistants, 
Merivaki said.
“These decisions were made without 
consulting with us,” said Merivaki, who ex-pressed disappointment with the school.
Merivaki has a 4-year-old daughter who 
is covered by other insurance because she 
couldn’t afford the dependent premium.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes wrote in 
an email that UF has offered graduates free 
health insurance since 2007 but is now asking that those covered by the plan pay the first $100 of any care they receive from a physi-cian in the GatorGradCare insurance network.
Graduate assistants are given the option to 
add spouses or children to the insurance plan, 
Sikes said.
Paula Fussell, vice president of human re-
sources at UF, said there are between 3,700 and 3,800 graduates enrolled in GatorGrad-
Care.
The graduates were told that the premium 
rates could go up, she said.
“When you have health insurance, it 
sometimes goes up,” Fussell said. “It’s not unusual for premiums to go up.” 
It doesn’t happen always, but it happens 
often, she said.
About 230 graduates enrolled in Gator-
GradCare have dependents listed, Fussell 
said. They are the ones who will see an in-
crease in charges.
Sebastian Sclofsky, an international gradu-
ate assistant originally from Uruguay, has watched his GatorGradCare dependents’ pre-mium fees go from about $2,396 to $4,325 for his wife and son since 2011.
Sclofsky makes about $15,000 a year as a 
graduate assistant in the political science de-
partment. He has seen only about a 3 percent 
increase in salary since 2011 but an overall 80.5 percent increase in insurance.
“In all the countries that I lived, I had 
health care,” said Sclofsky, who finds it dif-ficult to comprehend the rising costs.
With employee fees and on-campus rent 
increases, the school pressures graduate as-sistants to consider other sources of income, 
he said.
Sclofsky’s second son was born in the U.S. 
and is covered by Medicaid. Sclofsky, his wife 
and first son do not qualify under the Afford-able Care Act because of their international status.
“We still perform great research,” Sclofsky 
said. “It’s not an economic question. It’s more of a priority question.”
Merivaki spoke at the Student Town Hall meeting on July 7, where UF President Kent Fuchs was present, listening to students who expressed concerns for the Task Force Com-mittee.
Merivaki addressed the graduate assis-
tants’ employment conditions at UF, citing employment fees as an area to improve for 
the goal-setting task force.
It is important for UF to consider poli-
cies similar to other top institutions, both to 
improve the working conditions of existing graduate assistants and to attract prospective graduate assistants, she said.
Winfred Phillips, the goal-setting task 
force chairman and executive chief of staff, thanked her and acknowledged her concerns.
“Certainly outstanding graduate students 
are part of the preeminence goal,” Phillips said. “There’s no question, and we hear you.”
A chief negotiator for UF has scheduled a 
grievance hearing as part of the bargaining process. 
A date has not been arranged, Fussell said, 
but UF is working with the union to set one.Graduate Assistants United files grievance against UF
IT ALSO INCLUDES TOPICS 
LIKE DATING VIOLENCE.
By Patricia Potestades
Alligator Staff Writer
The alcohol education tutorial 
incoming students are required to complete received a major upgrade this semester.
“Think About It” is the name of 
UF’s new online education module, which now includes training on a broader range of safety issues — such as sexual harassment, dating violence and stalking — rather than focusing specifically on drinking.
Chris Loschiavo, deputy title IX 
coordinator for students, said recent cases of violence against women have led the UF Dean of Students Of-
fice to focus on prevention.
The office started researching 
new educational programs focused 
on prevention about a year ago. This particular program, distributed by CampusClarity, collects student sur-vey responses anonymously and al-lows the university to compare itself to other colleges nationwide.
“We’re working really hard here to be a model campus,” Loschiavo said.
Unlike the alcohol education 
module, “Think About It” includes more videos and interactive mate-rial.
“The data shows that students 
actually change behavior based on what they learned in the module,” 
said Jen Day Shaw, the UF associate 
vice president and dean of students.
The annual cost for the program 
is $32,250, which comes from the Di-vision of Student Affairs budget, said Kim Pace, the assistant vice presi-
dent for Student Affairs, in an email.
Elaine Khoo, a 21-year-old pub-
lic relations senior, said she doesn’t 
remember most of the information from the alcohol education module she completed her freshman year, but she likes that UF has broadened the scope of topics for the new mod-ule.
“I think it’s a good idea that UF is 
taking a stand,” Khoo said.

ColumnFlags aside, 
we have freedom
On Thursday, Gainesville actively joined the national contro-
versy surrounding the Confederate flag. Protesters came out to 
speak for and against the status of a statue depicting a confeder-ate soldier, which has the words “In memory of the Confederate dead” inscribed along its pedestal. 
We’ve got a story on the matter lying around somewhere if 
you’re interested in the developments, because that’s not what this particular editorial is about. On Thursday, there was shout-ing, there was chanting, there were messily scrawled signs.
But most significantly, there was an exchange, an exchange 
that we believe is more important than either camp’s stand on the controversy. Strong opinions have been raised on both sides re-garding the Confederacy’s role in American history, but between the angry shouting, raised signs and debates, it’s important to recognize how both sides are expressing themselves as funda-
mentally American. 
Freedom is an American ideal, and the freedom to voice how 
the world is influencing us is something that both sides have 
brought to the table. Whether you wish to bring the flag of slav-
ery down or preserve a symbol of your state’s history, you’re 
addressing your grievances and letting it be known how events matter to you. 
The freedom of speech and the freedom to stand by your 
views stand at the core of the American identity. Remember that while we may argue and fret over the standings of those around us, we are equal in our ability to be heard and no less for it if oth-ers disagree with what they hear. 
The person proudly waving a Confederate flag may merely de-
sire the ability to honor state and family, whereas the person try-ing to bring down the flag speaks in outrage against the worst of what that flag has represented in the past. Ultimately, neither of the individuals in question is any less for what he or she wishes 
to say.
It’s true, sometimes the people who disagree with your views 
can be honest boneheads with no damn clue about what they’re 
talking about, but you’ve probably been as much of an ignorant dumbass on other issues, and it’s important to remember that 
your concerns and your views do not make those of your peers 
any less significant. 
As Americans, we have a privilege, and some would say a 
responsibility, to stand by our ideals. 
At the end of the day, you’re performing your duty to the com-
munity, you’re bringing an issue of public debate into the public consciousness, and we salute you for it.Why people wear makeup is no one’s business
Despite the pop-song cliche that women 
are beautiful “just the way they are,” this often does not mean they are beau-tiful just as they wake up in the morn-ing. 
Rather, it means they are beautiful when 
they look like they’re not wearing any makeup to even out their skin tone, pink up their lips, and make their eyelashes unnaturally long.
The goal of makeup is to look like you’re 
not wearing any at all, resulting in confusing compli-
ments like, “You don’t need makeup. You’re perfect as 
you are,” even when the women they are speaking to have makeup on. 
These comments assume that every ounce of founda-
tion or dab of lip gloss is put on for the male gaze, ig-
noring the millions of other motivations someone might 
have for putting it on. 
Makeup can be empowering, but when it’s suggested 
that women wear makeup only to please men, and nev-
er for any intrinsic motive, putting makeup on can feel 
like being a pawn of the patriarchy. 
Put on makeup, but not too much. It has to look 
natural. What’s disturbing is the assumption of an even facial skin tone being normal when it’s not. Imperfec-
tions are actually the norm.
The fact is, whatever reason a person chooses to 
wear makeup, regardless of gender, is valid. 
Whether it’s to celebrate your femininity, cover up a 
blemish or look good for someone else, all reasons are 
legitimate. 
While people like to debate whom people wear 
makeup for, ultimately that is not important. 
What’s wrong is when people feel like they have to 
wear makeup to be accepted by others or to look pro-fessional. Our culture tells cisgender men that when 
they wake up, they are ready to go; women need makeup, but not too much, lest it look 
“caked on.”
Forced to deal with constant cultural scru-
tiny, women are accused of either wearing too 
much or not enough makeup. 
Women are put down for the amount of 
time they take to get ready, but putting on a full face of makeup takes time and skill. 
In an ideal world, all women would wear the amount 
of makeup that makes them happy, but there is a cer-
tain pressure to wear it to look “put together.” 
Makeup should be just another part of dressing up 
or a way of pampering yourself, like a day at the spa. It 
should not, however, be an expectation, or considered 
a professional requirement. 
Makeup can be a self-esteem booster, an expression 
of femininity, a way to show off skill or a myriad of 
other things. 
Reasons for wearing or not wearing makeup are as 
diverse as people themselves.

Darcie MacMahon was sitting at her desk 
Wednesday when she saw the email.
The message came from the Florida De-
partment of State, Division of History Resourc-es, notifying her that the Florida Museum of Natural History would be receiving a grant for almost $350,000 from the 2015-2016 special funding list, despite cuts in the state budget. The Matheson Historic Museum in downtown 
Gainesville also received a $300,000 grant.
“When I realized that we got the grant, I 
let out a scream and jumped up and down,” 
said MacMahon, the director of exhibits and 
public programs at the Florida Museum of 
Natural History.
The Florida Museum of Natural History 
will use the $349,800 grant to build a Discov-ery Zone, she said.
The grant came at the perfect time, said 
MacMahon, who has been fundraising the project for about three years. Without it, the 
project would’ve been significantly delayed.
Both museums completed the highly com-
petitive application for grant funding, with the Florida Museum of Natural History rank-ing No. 3 and Matheson ranking No. 31 for priority. The first 32 items on the prioritized list are fully funded.
The money for the Matheson Museum will go toward renovating the Melting Pot build-ing, located at 418 E. University Ave., execu-tive director Peggy Macdonald said.
Located across the street from Mathe-
son, the Melting Pot closed in 2009 and was bought by the Matheson Museum in 2014 for just less than $200,000, Macdonald said.
The grant will be used to renovate the out-
side and inside of the building. The museum’s library will be expanded and a community meeting room will be created, where groups will be able to meet at a low cost or for free, she said.
“It’s a nice way to help the community 
connect to its past,” Macdonald said. Local museums receive grants despite state budget cuts67 PERCENT OF 
FLORIDIANS WHO TOOK 
THE UF SURVEY SUPPORT 
THE REQUIREMENT.
By Dana Hatchett
Alligator Staff Writer
dhatchett@alligator.org
The results of a survey conduct-
ed at UF showed that 67 percent of 
Floridians support requiring Span-ish education in K-12 schools.      
“My expectation was that there 
would be some support to it, but I didn’t expect it to be 67 percent,” said Chris McCarty, director of UF’s Survey Research Center at the Bu-reau of Economic and Business Re-search and a co-author of the study.
The survey was designed to 
get opinions from Floridians about what they thought about requiring 
certain classes in school, one of 
which was Spanish.“I think it’s important to learn 
Spanish," said Jade Thomas, a UF psychology freshman. "Spanish is a language a lot of people know, and there’s a bunch of Spanish-speak-ing people here in Florida."
The questionnaire asked recipi-
ents what subjects students should be required to learn in school.
Based off of the results from the 
survey, computer skills had the highest support at 95 percent. Sec-ond language of student’s choice came in at 81 percent, Florida his-tory at 77 percent, and geometry 
with 75 percent support.
The findings of this research are 
significant because a constitutional 
amendment requiring Spanish in-struction would need 60 percent of voters, according to a press release.  
The highest number of support 
for a Spanish requirement was in southeast Florida with 72 percent. 
North, central, and southwest Flor-
ida all had more than 60 percent.Survey: Public schools 
should require Spanish

THEY WILL STILL HAVE 
THEIR FIVE-DAY GAME 
LATER THIS MONTH. 
By Elise Engle
Alligator Contributing Writer
After spending countless 
hours fighting the undead, the 
moderators of Gators Humans vs. Zombies are certainly not going to let any obstacle stand in the 
way of planning yet another suc-cessful mission.
Darby Guyn, a UF junior and 
vice president of Humans vs. 
Zombies, said the organization 
faced an issue when it was an-
nounced that Alex Pinchin, the group’s president, would not be returning to UF for his final se-mester.
Guyn, 19, said the group ap-
pointed an interim president for the remainder of the Summer. She said that because of the way 
the group’s constitution is writ-ten, she will likely be the presi-
dent in the Fall.
Despite the confusion over the 
presidency, Guyn said the mod-
erators have plenty planned for 
the Summer, highlighted by a full five-day game July 22 through 26.
“We’re going to be trying dur-
ing the Summer game to see what we can do that’s fun and exciting for Fall,” Guyn said.
Juan Oleas, a 23-year-old se-
nior and interim president for Human vs. Zombies, said the Summer game will be a “monster mashup,” making it unlike past games.
Oleas said the moderators are 
encouraging players to dress up in a classic horror movie theme, such as characters like Dracula and the Creature from the Black Lagoon.
“I hope it’s pretty immersive 
for the players because they tend to like when our characters dress 
up and they get into character, so hopefully they will enjoy that,” 
he said.
Guyn said she plans to con-
tinue in the Fall with the past president’s plans to work with Children’s Miracle Network.
“This Summer, due to the 
change in presidency, we haven’t been doing much,” Guyn said.
“But I’m looking in Fall about 
possibly doing a charity auction 
for NERF guns and also just rais-
ing money and raising awareness for the big game.”
Humans vs. Zombies president not returning to UF Gainesville Throwbacks
July 15, 1971: A new reli-
gious phenomenon known as the “Jesus people” began to 
rise in Gainesville, with the 
purpose of seeking a return to the lifestyle of early Chris-tians. Jonathan, a member 
of the Children of God — a 
chapter of the movement in Gainesville with a house at 505 S. Main St. — said that outside of a small vegetable garden, the group relies on 
donations from outsiders for 
food. Jonathan, 19, said his family was against his deci-sion to take part in the move-
ment. “My father even offered 
to buy me drugs if I wouldn’t go into this,” he said.July 14, 1992: A Gainesville man told UF police he was responsible for multiple inci-
dents of public masturbation 
on campus in recent weeks. UPD spokeswoman Angie Tip-ton said charges were pend-
ing for the 22-year-old man 
who confessed to eight counts of public masturbation even though he was only connected to seven.
July 18, 2002:  Two mem-
bers of UF’s Phi Kappa Tau fraternity chapter set off il-legal ﬁ  reworks at their fra-
ternity house that sparked a 
ﬁ  re, resulting in thousands of dollars worth of damage. A ﬁ  rework landed inside one of the columns in the front of the house, said Gainesville 
Fire Rescue spokesman Stuart 
Schwartz. This ignited a slow-burning ﬁ  re that climbed onto the roof, which had just been 
rebuilt three days earlier.

HOOVER, Ala. — For a first-
time head coach at Southeastern 
Conference Football Media Days, 
Florida’s Jim McElwain didn’t 
look the part.
While most of the coaches and 
student-athletes who appeared 
Monday wore an array of formal 
footwear, McElwain wore boat shoes — with no socks.
While those same coaches and 
players looked sharp and prepared 
from an appearance standpoint, 
the Montana native wore an awk-ward orange, faded sunburn on his face, possibly from one of the 
coach’s first extended forays with 
a Florida summer. 
Yet, he looked as comfortable, 
confident and jovial as ever.
Apart from his suit, it was as if 
he was relaxing in his livingroom after spending the weekend at the beach.
“It saves on laundry,” McEl-
wain said with a chuckle when he was asked about his lack of socks.
That epitomizes his personal-
ity, whether it be on vacation or in front of more than 1,000 media 
members from across the country. 
And that’s the attitude he’s try-ing to bring to his new program.
“Coach Mac is a laid back per-
son,” junior Vernon Hargreaves 
III said. “He doesn’t ask for much, just do what’s right.
“He can be intense. He has his 
times. But as far as intense like (Will) Muschamp, nah, he (isn’t) like Muschamp.”
McElwain’s temperament is a 
far cry from his predecessor Mus-
champ, a coach who became as 
synonymous with explosive fits of rage on the sidelines as he was for his defensive acumen.
Instead, McElwain brings a 
culture focused on building con-fidence within his team. 
Rather than regularly meeting 
mistakes with anger and disap-
pointment, he’s trying to get his 
players to trust in their abilities.
“He has us believing,” Harg-
reaves said. “He broke us down, the season that we had, and al-though the record may show we 
didn’t do that good, we were a 
few plays away, and that’s what he emphasizes.”
Sophomore Brandon Powell said the constant encouragement is helpful for the players, espe-cially when individuals get frus-trated.
“Coach Mac, he’ll come in a 
meeting and just crack a joke,” he said. “He’s really one of those 
types of guys. You can never get 
down with Coach Mac.”
McElwain’s plans for the of-
fense won’t dampen the team’s spirits, either. Although he was 
unwilling to give any inkling as to who has the edge in Florida’s starting quarterback battle, pass-
ing will be emphasized regard-less.
“I think background-wise,” 
Florida swimming and diving adds pair
The UF men's and women's swimming and diving teams have added a pair of 
signees to round out the 2015-16 rosters, Florida announced Monday. The men added sophomore Alex Katz, a transfer from the University of Michigan. The women added T eya Syskakis from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. SEC Media Days: McElwain establishing calm culture at UF

SEC MEDIA DAYS
By Luis T orres
Alligator Staff Writer
@LFTorresIII
 
HOOVER, Ala. — Speaking at his first 
Southeastern Conference Media Days as com-
missioner of the conference, Greg Sankey had one phrase that he constantly repeated: “The 
Times They Are a-Changing.”
The Bob Dylan song made famous during 
the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s was 
the calling card for Sankey when speaking about the changes the SEC has made recently.
“It is absolutely true that the times are 
changing rapidly all around us,” Sankey said. 
“In 2010, we experienced the first tremors 
of conference realignment, which largely left 
the SEC untouched, but in 2011 we welcomed 
and announced Texas A&M and Missouri as the SEC’s 13th and 14th members, welcoming them as full members in (2012).”
Sankey took over as SEC commissioner on June 1, two months before previously planned. Former commissioner Mike Slive had served as commissioner for just shy of 13 years, overseeing numerous transitions and changes throughout his era. 
Now, it's Sankey's turn. He touched base on the first year of the SEC 
Network and how the conference’s goal was to live stream 1,000 events. 
The network exceeded those expectations, 
streaming over 1,500 events in its first year. 
But Sankey highlighted one issue that has 
been at the forefront of the nation over the last couple of weeks: the confederate flag. 
Sankey praised what happened in South 
Carolina on Friday when the state government 
decided to remove the flag from the state capi-
tol grounds.
The commissioner also pointed out several 
university presidents who went along with the decision.  New SEC commissioner Sankey 
addresses culture, expectations
PURIFOY PLAYED 11 GAMES 
WITH THE INDIANAPOLIS 
COLTS LAST SEASON.
By Graham Hall
Alligator Staff Writer
@Graham311
Former UF cornerback Loucheiz Puri-
foy has been suspended by the NFL for 
the first 10 games of the 2015 season, as first reported by The Sports Xchange. The suspension is reportedly due to repeated 
violations of the NFL’s substance abuse 
policy.
Purifoy chose to forego his senior sea-
son at UF and enter the 2014 NFL Draft, but he went undrafted reportedly in part due to a history of off-the-field issues.Purifoy was allegedly caught in March 
2014 with marijuana and synthetic drugs 
known as bath salts.
It was reported that Purifoy was not 
arrested because he agreed to cooperate 
as an informant for the Gainesville Ala-chua County Drug Task Force. A sworn complaint was filed against him after in-vestigators were unable to contact him.
On May 12, 2014, the Indianapolis 
Colts announced it had agreed to terms 
with Purifoy.
Purifoy began the season with the 
Colts, playing in 11 games, primarily on 
special teams, before he was released on Nov. 27. The Seahawks claimed Purifoy off waivers but he was waived on Dec. 1 after failing a physical.
Purifoy is not currently employed by 
an NFL team. Former Gator Purifoy 
suspended 10 games of 2015 season by NFL “Coach Mac is a laid back 
person. He doesn't ask for 
much, just do what's right.”

McElwain said, “just historically, 
growing up out West and kind of being in the Big Sky Conference, 
… we threw it around the park 
quite a bit, and that’s something we believe in.”
Powell, a former running back 
who will play wide receiver this 
season, is one of the beneﬁ  ciaries 
of the new offense.
From a schematic standpoint, 
Powell said the offense had enough playmakers last season to be better than it ultimately was, but he believes the new coach-ing staff will be able to put those 
players in the right positions this 
year.
“That was the main thing last 
year,” Powell said. “We had the players, we just couldn’t ﬁ  nd the plays to run to help us out and put up points to help the defense out.”
That will be the key for the 
ﬁ  rst-year coach in 2015. 
With an unproven offensive 
line, few established weapons and uncertainty at quarterback, he and his staff’s ability to maxi-mize their players’ potential will be put to the test. 
There are plenty of deﬁ  ciencies 
for which coaching will need to make up the difference.
But there’s certainly no deﬁ  -
ciency in conﬁ  dence.
MCELWAIN,  from pg 13McElwain said the Gators will utilize the pass ofense more 
“I am particularly proud of the leader-
ship demonstrated on our campuses in the 
states at the center of this debate,” Sankey said. 
“South Carolina president Harris Pas-
tides, University of Mississippi interim chancellor Morris Stocks and Mississippi State University’s, along with their athletic directors and coaches, have all stated their desire for change.”     
Along with speaking about the changes 
the conference has made, Sankey added that within the ﬁ  ve months he was cho-sen to succeed former commissioner Mike 
Slive, he made a list of what the players of 
the SEC need to be: scholars, champions and leaders.
Three words deﬁ  ning how Sankey ex-
pects SEC athletes to carry themselves dur-ing his tenure as commissioner.
“For the words scholars, we want to 
graduate every student-athlete,” Sankey said. “For champions, we want to win 
every championship. And for leaders, we 
seek to literally inﬂ  uence the world.
“There is no great achievement that was 
ever produced by an attempt to be average, and we seek to be excellent.” 
Sankey said that coaches need to be 
more involved during the offseason to re-duce the amount of players that are getting in trouble with the law. 
He said the issues are alarming and de-
serving of a conversation in the near fu-ture.
“The idea behind a working group is to 
foster a conversation about how we might encounter the concern on conduct in a more global way,” Sankey said. “There’s a balance between the time demands placed on young people and the free time that can create problems … I think that’s part of why it’s healthy for us to have the exact conversation I anticipate occurring over the next 12 to 24 months.”
Sankey closed out his opening remarks 
by showing a video of the “Beyond the Field: Stories of the SEC." He mentioned that even though he is 
one of the faces of the conference, he him-self isn’t what makes the SEC.
“I’m the commissioner of the SEC, but 
they (the players) are the SEC,” Sankey said. 
“The times are changing. It is because 
of these stories and more that convince me 
the best days of the Southeastern Confer-
ence are still ahead.”

Jonathan Bullard was lucky. 
Unlike many players who feel 
forced to leave early for the NFL 
Draft in order to support their 
families back home, he had a choice.
“My parents aren’t in a situa-
tion where I need to get money fast,” the senior said. 
“I (saw) the improvement I 
could have in my game, and that’s what I wanted to come back and 
do.”
After completing his junior 
year, Bullard thought long and 
hard about whether he should 
turn pro or come back for one fi-
nal season at Florida. 
“When they’re telling you 
(that) you will get drafted, maybe not where you want to, but not too late either, it’s kinda tough,” he said, “because that’s your 
dream.”
Ultimately he chose to gamble 
on himself by staying with the 
Gators to push his draft stock to a 
first-round grade. 
And by doing so, he gives Flor-
ida a much-needed weapon and 
leader in the trenches.
“They lost a lot of guys who 
got drafted, pretty good players,” coach Jim McElwain said about the defensive line. 
“(Bullard) would have been 
one of those guys. For him to come back, we’re really excited.”
Florida lost four defensive line-
men from last year’s team, includ-ing Dante Fowler Jr., the No. 3 
overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.
That’s a huge void in both tal-
ent and experience. But Bullard thinks he can fill that void for the 
Gators.Ever since deciding to return to 
Florida, Bullard has taken it upon 
himself to become the leader on and off the field.
“I can’t tell you how proud I 
am (of him), … sitting in the of-
fice, saying ‘I’m ready to take a 
true leadership role and bring these guys along and show them how to do it,’” McElwain said.
It isn’t something that comes 
naturally to Bullard, a soft-spoken guy who prefers to let his play speak for him.
But with players like Fowler 
gone, he wants to assume that role and become a more vocal leader. 
It’s a tall task, but Bullard be-
lieves he is ready. 
“There’s a little more pressure 
on me to make the big plays at the big times,” Bullard said.
“That’s something I’m will-
ing to embrace and be more of a leader, bringing the defensive line together a little more and kinda stepping in to what Dante did.”TUESDAY, JULY 14, 2015   ALLIGATOR   15

HOOVER, Ala. — As Vernon 
Hargreaves III enters his third sea-
son at Florida, there isn’t much the All-American defensive back can im-
prove upon.
But even with the accolades that 
he’s garnered during his first two 
seasons as a Gator, including being named a semifinalist for the Chuck Bednarik Award last season, the Tampa native continues to hone his craft.
“It’s going to sound cliché but 
everything,” Hargreaves said when asked what he’s been working on. 
“All aspects of my game. Tack-
ling, getting faster, getting quicker, press coverage, off coverage. I’m just working on my game, trying to be better than what I already am.”
One person who is working with 
Hargreaves is UF defensive backs 
coach Kirk Callahan. 
Callahan came to Florida from 
UCF, and in the small amount of 
time that Hargreaves has worked with him he’s received some solid advice from the new coach. 
“I guess playing your game more 
than anything,” Hargreaves said. “Not necessarily try to be anybody 
else. You gotta do what’s comfort-
able to you and just play hard, play fast. Not too much, yet.”
It’s easy for Hargreaves to feel comfortable, considering his evalua-
tion of his own talent. 
He doesn’t think there’s another 
defensive back like him in the coun-
try, let alone in the SEC. 
“I’m the best corner in college 
football,” Hargreaves said. “Without a doubt.”
One of the things he hasn’t had 
to work on is his level of competi-tiveness. Coach Jim McElwain has seen how Hargreaves makes those around him better with his tireless work ethic. “He’s all that’s been advertised,” 
McElwain said. “That guy is a great player, understands how to han-dle himself, gets it and he loves to compete. When the competition is there he elevates his play a little bit more, which then in turn the people around him they can elevate a little 
bit based on that energy.”
Bringing out the best in others 
is one of the things that separate’s 
Hargreaves. He embraces being the guy that’s always pushing his team-mates.
“It’s just compete hard all the 
time. Just take no plays off, don’t give anybody any breaks,” Harg-
reaves said. 
“Some guys you know you’re bet-
ter than don’t give them any breaks. 
Keep going as hard as you can.”
With Fall camp getting underway 
on Aug. 6 and the season opening a month after, there are a lot of pieces in the secondary for defensive coor-dinator Geoff Collins and Callahan to 
work with.
Hargreaves isn’t the only one 
with a chance to shine this season 
with Jalen Tabor, Quincy Wilson, Brian Poole and Keanu Neal return-ing for the Gators. Hargreaves said the defense is going to rely on the secondary because it’s the best part of the team.
It’s a unit that could be among 
one of the best in the country if they live up to their potential. Hargreaves doesn’t plan on disappointing, but like the SEC Media Days, everything is all talk at this point. Nothing mat-ters until the season opens. 
“I think we can be the best if we 
want to be. ” Hargreaves said. 
“The only way that we’re going to 
find out is when the season starts.”Hargreaves continuing to develop as UF defense reloads
