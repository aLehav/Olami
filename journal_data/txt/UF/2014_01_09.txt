UF’s ban on ﬁ  rearms has loosened fol-
lowing a Florida appellate court decision 
that allows for guns locked inside a vehicle to be brought on campus. 
The court decision came in December 
after a University of North Florida student ﬁ  led a lawsuit against the university chal-lenging its ban on storing ﬁ  rearms in vehi-cles on campus. The court ruled in favor of the student, setting precedent for Florida’s other state universities.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said a 
University Police policy for storing ﬁ  re-arms in vehicles on campus was removed 
shortly after the court decision. 
Sikes said UF’s gun policy doesn’t ad-
dress ﬁ  rearms in vehicles, so a footnote was added to ensure clarity. 
The footnote states that the university 
will comply with state law, speciﬁ  cally 
those governing guns securely encased in a vehicle.
“That’s not to say that guns are allowed 
on campus, because they’re not,” she said. 
“As long as people keep their guns in a UF allows guns in cars on campus

A phishing scam has recently surfaced 
to hook students into providing their Ga-
torLink information.
The scammer, posing as the UF Com-
puting Help Desk, sends a malicious 
email instructing users to follow a link to 
change their UF Webmail account infor-mation.
A variation of the scam email also in-
cluded the accurate UF Computing Help Desk contact information to further con-fuse students.
An alert for the scam was released 
Monday by UF Information Technology.
UFIT communications manager Tracy 
Gale said no one from the UF Help Desk can send mass emails to students.
“Nobody at UF will ask for your Ga-
torLink password,” she said.
UFIT releases alerts of phishing scams 
immediately on social media once they are reported by IT security, Gale said.
Austin Landis, an 18-year-old UF in-
ternational studies freshman, said it could be easy for students to fall for scams con-sidering how often UF sends out remind-ers to change passwords.
“I know my passwords are considered 
weak,” she said. “UF is always trying to 
make them stronger.”
Gale said there is no way of knowing 
how many students were affected by the 
recent scams. 
“A university environment has a false 
sense of security,” she said. “Having strong passwords is a really big help.”Scam emails

“The Greatest Show on Earth” is coming to Gainesville on 
Friday for the ﬁ  rst time in its 144-year history.
Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey presents “Super Circus 
Heroes,” which features performers and animals from around 
the world. Shows will be Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
Melinda Hartline, a spokesperson for Ringling Bros., said 
this tour is unique because it was designed for smaller venues so everyone could have a chance to see it.
“We’d seen trends from past shows in Tampa, Jacksonville 
and Orlando and realized that people were traveling long dis-tances to get there,” she said. “We wanted to save some time 
and come to you.”
Acts will include aerialists, acrobats, extreme motorcyclists 
and animals such as elephants, camels and horses, Hartline 
said.One act in particular, called “Cartin’ Canines,” features 
dogs that have been rescued from shelters or given up by their owners. 
“Super Circus Heroes” is currently one of three units touring 
the U.S. Other tours include “Belt to Amaze” and “Legends.”
Some students were surprised to hear the circus was com-
ing such as David Wasserman, a 22-year-old UF urban regional 
planning graduate student.
“I hadn’t heard anything about it at all, but I’d want to go,” ‘The Greatest Show on Earth’ will come to UF this weekendSEE GUNS, PAGE 4

during cold snap 
LIGONIER, Pa. — A western 
Pennsylvania pizza shop has been delivering prescription medicines and other supplies to ill and elderly residents so they don’t have to go outside in the bitter cold.
Tom Wynkoop, owner of 
Fox’s Pizza Den in Ligonier, tells WPXI-TV that he tweeted his offer because his community about 45 miles east of Pittsburgh has a lot of elderly residents.
Wynkoop told those in need 
to call his cellphone to arrange deliveries of prescription medi-cines and other products — no strings attached. That’s right: Folks don’t have to order food from Wynkoop’s shop to get help.
Wynkoop says his shop has 
made four deliveries. He says, “You have to be there for your residents.”
The region was hit with re-
cord-low, subzero temperatures Tuesday. Temperatures were subfreezing by Wednesday.

Peacock freezes to tree after 
Chicago zoo escape DUNDEE, Ill. — An ad-
venturous peacock had to be rescued by Chicago-area ﬁ  re-ﬁ  ghters after he ﬂ  ew from his heated pen to a nearby tree and froze to a branch in sub-zero temperatures.
The (Arlington Heights) 
Daily Herald reports that Blue the peacock is recovering after Tuesday’s misadventure that lasted about 90 minutes.
Blue managed to ﬂ  y from 
his enclosure at the Randall Oaks Barnyard Zoo in Dundee and perched atop a nearby pine.
Fireﬁ  ghters with a ladder 
helped zoo staff pluck the wayward bird from the tree. Temperatures at the time were 12 degrees below zero.
Brian Mangiaracina is Ran-
dall Oaks’ park and division manager. He says the whole thing was a “freakish acci-dent” and that Blue is in quar-antine.
Dundee is about 35 miles 
northwest of Chicago.

he said. “It sounds fun.”
The circus may be an opportu-
nity for students to go back to the 
day when they first went inside that red-and-white-striped tent.
“I went when I was a little kid. 
People probably want to go for the nostalgia factor,” said Josh Cruz, a 20-year-old UF finance junior. “It’s like reliving your childhood.” 
Ticket sales are expected to 
be strong at the O’Connell Cen-ter because the circus has already broken sales attendance records in 
Tampa, Jacksonville and Orlando, Hartline said.
Ticket prices range from $15 to 
about $60 and will be sold at the gates. Showtimes are Friday at 7 
p.m.; Saturday at 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.; and Sunday at 1 p.m.
Hartline, who has been work-
ing with Ringling. Bros. for 18 years, said she gets the most satis-faction from seeing multiple gen-erations coming together to see the show.
“It’s a time-held tradition for 
the family,” she said. “I get to see not only the smiles on children’s faces but also on the adults who feel like champions watching it.”BEATRICE DUPUY

Starting Monday at 7 a.m, devic-
es that have not been installed with 
anti-virus software and updated with Java and Flash will be locked out of UF’s Wi-Fi.
Students can check their devic-
es for the current requirements at getonline.ufl.edu.
Tracy Gale, UF Information Tech-
nology communications manager, said the device updates are neces-sary to protect student information and the university.
“You need to make sure what 
you have is safe,” she said. “We’re not trying to make this a hassle. We’re trying to protect your person-al information as well as the univer-
sity’s networks.”
Device updates are held each se-
mester. 
For Sarah Lassiter, a 20-year-old 
UF finance junior, the frequent up-dates are frustrating. Lassiter said 
she has a hard time remembering to update her devices.
However, she said the constant 
updates make her feel more secure about using the school’s Wi-Fi.
Christine Giannettino, a 22-year-
old UF health education junior, said 
she will make an effort to update her 
devices.
“Nowadays, anyone can hack

Alachua County Sheriff’s deputies arrested 
a local woman Wednesday morning after dep-
uties said she hit her estranged husband with her car and chased him with a bat. 
Deputies arrested 41-year-old Tara Lyso-nya Johnson in response to charges of aggra-vated assault and battery originally filed by Gainesville Police, wrote GPD spokesman of-ficer Ben Tobias in an email.
At about 6:30 a.m., Johnson went to her 
husband’s job to find out why he hadn’t come 
home. After she saw her husband’s ex-girl-
friend drop him off, Johnson purposefully hit him with her car, according to an arrest report. 
She then stopped the 
car, pulled a bat from the 
trunk and began chasing 
him with it, according to 
the report.
Johnson drove away af-
ter the incident, and depu-ties later arrested her at her 
home, according to the report.Johnson’s husband was taken to UF Health 
Shands Hospital after feeling hip pain, Tobias wrote.
During questioning, Johnson told police 
she did not hit her husband with her car and that he jumped on the car and may have fallen off, according to Tobias. She also denied chas-ing him with a bat.
Deputies booked Johnson into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 10:30 a.m., where she re-mained as of press time.Woman arrested after purposefully hitting husband with car

Bust out the polyester and 
big hair — the sounds of the 
‘80s are coming to UF.
The musical “Rock of 
Ages” is coming to the Phil-lips Center for Performing Arts on Friday at 7:30 p.m. 
Tickets for the perfor-
mance are $20 for UF students and can be purchased at the 
Phillips Center Box Office or 
the University Box Office.
A valid Gator 1 Card must 
be shown to purchase tick-ets.
“We’ve done these types 
of events before with ‘In the Heights’ and ‘The Wedding Singer,’” said Elizabeth Auer, the Phillips Center’s assistant director. “We can help them 
prepare for the tour, we’re 
known for doing this, and that’s why they asked us to host the show.”
The show is the first per-formance by the cast of a na-tional tour directed by The 
Road Company, a New York-
based production company. 
The cast arrived in 
Gainesville on Jan. 2 for its first rehearsal.
“This is the first time the 
cast has been on set — full costume, makeup, even wigs,” Auer said.
After kicking off in 
Gainesville, the tour is sched-
uled to continue throughout 
the nation, ending in Denver. 
“We’ve had many more 
musicals this season than in the past,” said Todd Taylor, a Phillips Center public rela-
tions associate. “But of all the 
genres we present, the Broad-way musicals appeal to UF students the most.” 
UF biology freshman 
Kelsey Gwin, 18, has yet to attend a Broadway perfor-mance at the Phillips Center but said she didn’t realize 
ticket prices were so low.
“I don’t know why I 
haven’t gone yet,” she said.

fun show that I want to see.”‘Rock of Ages’ tour

Vehicles with guns must be locked
closed container in their vehicle, we shouldn’t have 
a problem.”
William Salvato, a 21-year-old UF biology se-
nior and president of UF’s Students for Concealed Carry chapter, said the ruling brings the club closer 
to its goal of decriminalizing possession of a fire-
arm while on campus. 
“We think it’s a big step in our direction,” Sal-
vato said. ”We finally have something that’s been done toward our ultimate goal.”
He said the university’s current program, which 
allows students to store their firearms at UPD and check them out, isn’t practical.
Because alerts of dangerous activity near cam-
pus are a regular occurrence, Salvato said, owning 
a gun for self defense and having to leave it at the 
police station was impractical.
“Crime doesn’t have a time or place where it will occur,” he said. “When every second counts and the police are minutes away, having your weapon on you makes a difference.”
Other UF students are more leery of the court’s 
decision. 
Andrew Sanchez, a 19-year-old UF biochemis-
try freshman, said the court’s decision only spells trouble. 
Sanchez said letting students have firearms on 
campus could complicate already bad situations such as a robbery or assault.
“The police will always be your best option,” he 
said.
He said prior to the ruling, anyone knowingly 
bringing a firearm on campus would obviously have bad intentions. 
Now, someone with malicious intent can have a 
gun in his or her vehicle on campus without hassle from the police.
“My gut instinct says it’s a little dangerous,” 
Sanchez said. GUnS , from page 1

With the new year comes a 
new way for workers to collect 
overdue paychecks.
The Alachua County Wage 
Recovery Program, which offers a structured method for help-ing residents negotiate with em-
ployers to get withheld wages, 
launched Jan. 1. 
The ordinance passed 3-2 at 
an April County Commission meeting, about four months af-
ter its inception, according to Al-
ligator archives. 
So far, no one has ﬁ  led a claim 
with the ofﬁ  ce, said Alachua County equal opportunity man-ager Jacqueline Chung.
“We have received some calls 
with questions but no formal 
complaints yet,” she said. 
When the complaints do 
start rolling in, the ofﬁ  ce will be 
ready, she said. One full-time 
employee has been designated to 
investigate wage theft as well as reported discrimination in em-ployment or housing.
The ﬁ  rst step of the wage re-covery process is for the employ-ee to alert the employer that they 
owe wages within 60 days after 
the money was due. 
If the employee can’t resolve 
the issue alone, he or she must contact the county Equal Oppor-
tunity Ofﬁ  ce within 180 days — 
about ﬁ  ve months — to get the mediation process started. 
Although no one has taken 
advantage of the system yet, em-ployee rights activist Jeremiah Tattersall said the measure is giving workers conﬁ  dence to confront employers who owe 
them money.
Tattersall, who advocated for 
the measure with the Alachua 
County Wage Theft Task Force, 
said he knew of one person 
afraid to speak up about wage theft. But after the ordinance took effect, the employee felt comfortable enough to talk to the 
employer about the issue as the 
ﬁ  rst step of the wage recovery process dictates, and the worker received the withheld money. 
“Having the legal backing 
helps people be bolder,” Tatter-sall said. 
He said younger workers can 
especially beneﬁ  t from the wage 
recovery program. 
“Students tend to take the 
lower-paid jobs,” he said, “and 
the research shows that the low-
er paid your job … the more sus-
ceptible you are to wage theft.”County launches wage

Alachua County Sheriff’s 
deputies used a Taser on a New-
berry man early Wednesday after deputies said he refused to leave a Wafﬂ  e House. 
Thomas Esli Thompson, 59, 
was arrested on charges of tres-passing and resisting an ofﬁ  cer, according to an arrest report.
At about 3:50 a.m., Thompson 
walked into the Wafﬂ  e House at 7611 W. Newberry Road and asked for a cup of water. Thomp-son mentioned 
to an employee that he wasn’t leaving the restaurant un-til the bus line began running again, accord-ing to the re-port. 
The employee told Thompson 
he could not stay that long and asked him to leave several times. She then called the police.
A deputy arrived and told 
Thompson he would be arrested if he didn’t leave. Thompson re-fused, according to the report.
The deputy told Thompson he was under arrest. Thompson 
responded by shoving his right 
hand in his pocket and telling the ofﬁ  cer “You don’t know what I got!”
The deputy drew his gun 
and told Thompson to take his hand out of his pocket. Thomp-son refused, and the deputy told Thompson if he continued to 
resist he would use a Taser, to 
which Thompson replied, “Tase!” The deputy then deployed his Taser twice and was able to place Thompson in handcuffs.
Thompson was booked in 
jail at about 5 a.m. Wednesday, where he remained in lieu of a $5,000 bond.

Rap group sues FBI
“Workaholics” fans remember the episode in which 
Adam, Ders and Blake become entangled with the Jug-galos, or devotees of the rap and hip-hop duo Insane 
Clown Posse. Members of the Juggalos are, stereotypically, drug-addled low-income followers of the band famous for 
their yearly gathering — or as the New York Daily News 
called it, “weeklong bacchanal” — called the Gathering of the Juggalos. The Gathering is notorious for Juggalos engaging in “blatant drug use and general bad behavior.”
That particular episode of “Workaholics” ends happily 
enough: A female Juggalo, played by the delightful Rebel Wilson, convinces Adam to care less about how others see him, and a nice Juggalo family charms Ders. 
However, in reality, Juggalos are classiﬁ  ed by the authori-
ties as a gang. 
The Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union joined Insane Clown Posse and four fans to announce a lawsuit against the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice yesterday to protest what they perceive as the unfair labeling of a group of music fans.
The New York Times stated, “The seeds of this lawsuit 
were sown in 2011, when the F.B.I.’s National Gang Intelli-gence Center published a report that described Juggalos as 
‘a loosely organized hybrid gang’ whose members were ‘ex-
panding into many U.S. communities.’”
The New York Daily News article included links to other 
stories detailing various acts of crime that Juggalos has been held responsible for, including a testimony from former real-ity star Tila Tequila claiming Insane Clown Posse fans tried to kill her at a concert. 
According to the New York Daily News, “‘It’s time for the 
FBI to come to its senses and recognize that Juggalos are not 
a gang but a worldwide family united by the love of music,’ 
said one member of the rap duo, Joseph Bruce, aka Violent J, in a statement released by the Michigan American Civil Lib-erties Union, which joined the suit.”
We’re skeptical of Insane Clown Posse proponents who 
claim the Juggalo community is a “family” united purely by a “love of music.” It’s not as if the songs promote peace or positive change. Its 2009 hit “Miracles” contains the often-quoted (and often-mocked) lyric, “F****** magnets, how do 
they work?”
So is Insane Clown Posse genuinely concerned for the 
well-being of its fans? Probably not. 
The lawsuit smacks of an attempt to stir publicity for an 
irrelevant fringe group. 
Photos of the duo in their signature black-and-white clown 
facepaint looking noticeably out-of-place in an ofﬁ  cial ACLU 
press conference accompanied the online story. 
In full Insane Clown Posse gear, including oversized jer-
seys and chains, the two men stared pensively at the ACLU representative speaking for them. 
“This is what revolution looks like!!” commented one on-
line reader.Legalized marijuana means higher tax 
New Year’s Eve was about lighting ﬁ  reworks. New 
Year’s Day in Colorado was just about lighting up.
But that’s old news, of course. It’s nearly impos-
sible to live in a college town like Gainesville and not hear some excited stoners talk of the new weed mecca.
Marijuana’s legalization means more than a few people 
getting high: Tax revenue will rise, too. Some estimates state 
that it’ll generate $67 million each year for the state, with just 
less than half that revenue going to schools, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
But with strict regulations on growing and selling, it’s dif-
ﬁ  cult for stores to keep up with demand. At least 37 stores 
are licensed to sell pot, and they collectively made more than 
$1 million the ﬁ  rst day.
Many of these shops are saying a sellout is imminent. 
Such a limited supply, of course, is increasing prices and 
might push some back to the black market where prices are 
low because of nonexistent taxes.
That black market is part of why marijuana has had such a 
bad reputation for so long. This is not a column to glamorize weed or speculate how long it’ll be before it’s legal in Florida 
— it’s to lament injustice many face because of this plant.
Despite known medicinal properties, prescription weed 
will only be legal in 21 states and Washington, D.C. — at 
least once New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo legalizes it by 
executive order. 
And even though there has never been a documented 
death because of marijuana, it’s beaten into our heads that 
it is a dangerous drug. It remains a schedule-one drug along with heroin, apparently worse than methamphetamine and 
cocaine.
In a way, it is more dangerous — because it’s illegal. With-
out legalization, marijuana proﬁ  ts fall to drug cartels instead 
of state coffers.
Multimillion-dollar tunnels dug under the U.S.-Mexico 
border can get weed here without customs and drug-snifﬁ  ng dogs. And even though they’re expensive to construct, they can pay for themselves multiple times over in a single day.
So, because marijuana is illegal 
here, drug cartels that kill innocent people and control countless Mex-ican government ofﬁ  cials through bribery continue to rake in mas-
sive proﬁ  ts.
Not much is known about the 
people who dig the tunnels. At ﬁ  rst, it was rumored anyone 
who dug them were killed immediately afterward to main-tain secrecy. One of the only ﬁ  rsthand accounts from a tunnel 
digger tells the story of someone forced at gunpoint to dig for 
12 hours a day for $150 a week.
As long as it remains proﬁ  table, these cartels will continue 
to operate and mar everything around them.
Uruguay recently legalized marijuana to combat this 
very problem. To ensure it’s not proﬁ  table, they’re setting the price at only $1 a gram. Stores running short on green in Colorado were charging up to $70 for an eighth of an ounce, or 3.5 grams, according to Time magazine, which by com-
parison was selling the same product for $35 for medicinal 
purposes before if was legal for recreational purposes. 
It’s not just cartels that are threatened by the legalization 
of weed, though. The prison industry is as well. The U.S. has 
the highest incarceration rate in the world, with roughly 25 
percent of the world’s prisoners, according to an OP-Ed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Its high population stems from numerous nonviolent offenders housed in our prisons such as those charged with marijuana possession. 
Legalizing weed is one of the best things we can do for 
this hemisphere. It will reduce crime and the number of peo-ple in prison who shouldn’t be there, and it will boost our economy.
So you can put that in your pipe and smoke it.Justin Jones is a UF journalism senior. His column runs on

More than 4.6 million people entered 
2014 with a little less privacy after hack-
ers published phone numbers and aciIT-count information from the smartphone app Snapchat on New Year’s Eve. 
Although smartphone users used the 
app to share 10-second pictures of their festivities, the website SnapchatDB.info uploaded phone numbers and user In-ames from 4,609,621 accounts from 78 area codes across the U.S. and Canada. 
The website censored the last two 
digits of each phone number to prevent spam and abuse, but it will possibly release the uncensored database to in-terested parties “under certain circum-stances.”
“Having my account leaked — it 
made me fearful of using social media and what it’s capable of,“ said Laura Turk, an 18-year-old UF industrial and systems engineering freshman. 
According to a statement published 
on the website, the leak was intended to bring public attention to the flaws in the Snapchat security pointed out in a Christmas Day report posted by Aus-
tralia-based security research company 
Gibson Security. 
The report was publicly released af-
ter attempts to privately contact Snap-
chat were unsuccessful. It provided the 
previously unpublished code needed to 
match numbers with names and create 
fake accounts. 
“Privacy is overstated on some of 
these social media platforms,” said Bruce Floyd, UF social media specialist. “The idea that you can post an image of yourself or something with the promise that only the intended viewer will see it is wishful thinking.”
In a blog post published Jan. 2, Snap-
chat promised to release an update that will allow users to opt out of the Find Friends part of the application and im-prove restrictions and rate limiting to prevent future attacks. The post also stated that pictures sent through the app were not leaked and only usernames and phone numbers were accessed. 
Additional websites have been set 
up by Gibson Security and other corpo-rations for users to determine whether individual account information was leaked. 
Criticism from social media experts 
regarding its supposed privacy and its origin as a sexting app did not stop Snapchat from becoming one of the most downloaded apps of 2013, but it remains to be seen whether the leak has any effect on its usage.
“I’m going to keep using it even 
though it annoys me a little bit that my number got leaked,” said Kenneth Fer-nandez, a 19-year-old UF exploratory engineering freshman. “I can’t really do anything about it. My number is out there even if I stop using it.”Snapchat apologizes for hacking, 
introduces preventative measuresnudes

Snapchat, the popular picture sharing app, was hacked over Winter 
Break,  releasing more than 4 million account usernames and phone numbers. It remains to be seen if this will affect usage.

Before taking our chemistry tests, a friend of mine 
used to say we weren’t actually anxious, but we were 
instead excited, like electrons. I would just look at her and roll my eyes. No one could convince me that my increased state of agitated energy was anything but 
an expression of dread and fear.
Of course, my friend has al-
ways been the more optimistic one, 
whereas when I see a phone call from my dad, my brain immedi-ately jumps to someone has died, or I’ve messed something up.
Studies have shown that opti-
mistic or happy people are healthi-
er, more successful and live longer. 
And according to a December study published online 
in the American Psychological Association’s Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, positive peo-ple have another thing going for them: They perform better on activities that trigger anxiety.
The research, conducted by Alison Wood Brooks, 
an assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, finds that telling yourself 
you are excited before a stressful event can be more 
effective than telling yourself to calm down. 
The experiment evaluated participants in differ-
ent exercises like public speaking, karaoke singing and math-test taking. The individuals who were in-structed to try to get excited performed better than those who were told to try to remain calm.
Dr. Linda Lewis, licensed mental health counselor 
at UF’s Counseling & Wellness Center, said for some 
people, the word “anxious” means unease or worry, 
whereas for others, it means eagerness or anticipa-tion. The body reacts the same way whether one is anxious for positive or negative reasons, she said. 
“The way we talk about our feelings has a strong 
influence on how we actually feel,” according to the study.
So, saying “I’m excited” out loud before a dreaded 
activity can actually increase feelings of excitement. 
Lewis said this is why counselors ask students to 
say positive affirmations or make goals out loud. 
Though Lewis is not familiar with the full study, 
she said it may change how she works with students on anxiety before their exams.
Sara Martin, health promotion specialist at Gator-
Well Health Promotion Services, said three strategies she teaches for stress management are preparation, confidence and relaxation, and those first two steps 
deal mostly with study skills and time management.
Therefore, you can tell yourself whatever you 
want, but if you do not have a solid foundation, you 
are still probably not going to do well on your exams. But if you are fully prepared and still anxious, you can try tricking your brain into thinking you are ex-cited for that test and train it to perform better.
What’s the worst you can do? Or, let me rephrase 
that. What’s the best that can happen?Excitement may 
lead to better performance8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 2014

� THE PETER PILOTTO LINE  
HAS ABOUT 70 ITEMS.

A handful of individuals were 
able to sneak a peek at the highly 
anticipated Peter Pilotto for Tar-get collection, thanks to leaked images that infiltrated online 
fashion feeds in December. If you 
missed the window of opportu-nity, you’ll have to join the rest of the fashion world waiting for the line’s in-store debut Feb. 9.
The flurry surrounding the 
pictures undoubtedly fanned the fashionable flame surrounding the collaboration, which had sim-
mered down since its initial Sept. 
16 announcement. 
But before the images were re-
moved from fashion blogs, quick glances still resulted in praises of an affordable line ringing true to the aesthetic of the award-win-ning designers.
The Peter Pilotto womenswear 
collection is known for its youth-ful pieces featuring bright, digi-tally altered mixed patterns and 
sculptural silhouettes. 
According to Target, the limit-
ed-edition line will feature nearly 
70 items ranging from $14.99 to $79.99. And that’s a steal for fash-ion-forward students on a budget, considering the average Peter Pi-lotto dress at Bergdorf Goodman costs $1,000 or more. 
The line will also be made 
available at online retail site Net-a-Porter, so the collection will be accessible on an international level. 
Worn by trendsetting stars 
like Emma Watson, Kerry Wash-ington, Kristen Stewart and Sel-ena Gomez, style-crazed college 
students can soon join their elite 
ranks when the high-end line floods Target floors this spring.  New Target line leaked

With a new year comes a new 
beginning to the independent film 
scene in Gainesville. This week, the Avenue caught up with Jason Mc-Neal, a film lover and movie buff  who has been on the hunt for great, contemporary indie films to show in the area. “$5 Films,” as he calls it, will take place at the Wooly in the heart of downtown, located next to the Top.
Through the end of the month, 
Jason is bringing it all every Thurs-day at 8 p.m. — comedy, horror, documentaries and cult classics, to name a few. He said he’s tired of Hollywood’s superhero epics and is doing things his own way — show-ing films that are in your face and personal. For many of the films, this may be the only time they have been shown in a movie-theater setting.  Tickets can be purchased at the door or online at squareup.com/market/the-wooly.
Here’s what Jason has to say 
about the films:
Indie films to shake up Thursday nights in Gainesvillemovies 
“Bad Milo!”
Genre: horror/comedy
Showing: Today at 8 p.m.
Admission: Free
- “That is a (film) similar to ‘Gremlins,’ about 
a small demon that lives in a guy’s colon.  It 
escapes and starts killing people,” Jason said. “Yeah, there’s only one way for him to exit.”“Dear Mr. Watterson”
Genre: documentary
Showing: Thursday, Jan. 16, at 8 p.m.
Admission: $5 
- A portion of the proceeds will go to a ben-
efit for the Sequential Arts Workshop, which is a 
nonprofit organization in Gainesville that Jason 
is trying to help.
- “That’s about the creator of Calvin and Hob-
bes, which has been out of print for 15-some -
thing years. But the creator, Bill Watterson, is no -
toriously reclusive, and so he did that comic strip 
for a number of years and quit and has gone cold turkey and never done anything else. So this guy who made the documentary tried to write him a letter and couldn’t finish it,” Jason said. “That’s 
why it’s called ‘Dear Mr. Watterson.’”“Ms. 45”
Genre: cult classic from 1981, uncut
Showing: Thursday, Jan. 23, at 8 p.m.
Admission: $5
- Directed by Abel Ferrara, who is similar to 
Martin Scorsese in the indie-film world. 
- “So this is a re-release of a 1981 film, and 
it’s about a New York City mute — she can’t hear 
or speak — who gets assaulted and then takes revenge on the criminal elements of New York City.”“Bettie Page Reveals All”
Genre: documentary
Showing: Thursday, Jan. 30, at 8 p.m. 
Admission: $5
- “She was a pinup model back in the ‘50s, 
and she . . . also became a recluse as well. She became a born-again Christian and turned her back on the whole modeling community,” Ja-son said. “There’s been a lot of documentaries about her, but this is the first one that is her talking about herself, which is unusual. She wanted to give up that part of her life and was in hiding for 20-something years and someone found her … and gradually got her to open up what she had done.”THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Send a question to letmegatoraidyou.tumblr.com .“How do you have a normal conversation with someone on Tinder?”
— Anonymous
What would you consider a “normal” conversation? If you’ve registered your phone 
with Tinder, you are more than likely looking to entertain yourself with all of the… 
interesting… people in your area. Let’s be real here. Tinder wasn’t created for finding “the one.” Protest if you must, but who joins a hookup app without expecting anything less than people to get right to the point? With that said, here are a few ways to keep the creepers at bay. 
1 Update your About Me section: If your description says something like “SeXyGiRl25: I like to party, drink and I’m up for literally anything!!” something’s gotta change. 
2Change your picture: If you are only allowed six pictures on Tinder and you’re looking for “normal” conversations, why in the world would all of your photos be of you in little 
to no clothing or you participating in some type of lip-biting shenanigans? 
3Be straightforward: Let everyone you talk to know you want to be treated with respect. If someone comes on a little too strong, take a few steps back. This is a hookup app, so 
there will be people (lots of them, in all honesty) who make their first words to you sound like the script of a ’70s porno, so if you’re looking for a “normal” conversation, stay away from those who do.GatorAidAlready grossing $88.7 million,

As this Sunday’s 71st Golden 
Globe Awards approach, Martin 
Scorsese’s “The Wolf Of Wall Street” 
has garnered much attention.
Nominated for Best Motion Pic-
ture, Musical or Comedy, the film 
is fit to contend alongside worthy 
films “American Hustle,” “Her,” 
“Inside Llewyn Davis” and “Ne-braska.”
Diverging from his last picture, 
“Hugo” (2011), a children’s movie 
in revolutionized 3-D, Scorsese’s 
most recent film is nothing short of charming. However, the charm might be hard to see blurred be-
hind layers of debauchery, midget 
tossing and hedonism. But as each 
layer is peeled away like a cocaine-snorting, office-orgy onion, there is a core left and a message that has 
been told long before: Greed topples 
man. And, possibly, hookers topple 
man, too.
Adapted for the screen by Ter-
ence Winter, the film is based on the 
personal memoir of Jordan Belfort 
— played by Leonardo DiCaprio — 
a multimillionaire by 30 who served time in prison for fraud crimes. 
The film shows the rise and fall 
of one of the most powerful indi-
viduals on Wall Street and his con-
sequential demise from living a life of excess and deception. The raun-chy cycle of self-indulgence that is Jordan Belfort’s life is brilliantly captured by DiCaprio. 
This is the wildest, most goose-
bump-inducing, three-hour movie that I have come across. But, if you are looking for how Belfort de-stroyed the lives of many, this film is relatively disappointing. Instead, it’s an introspection into his life as he explains how he got away with his evil, genius plan through a per-sistent, first-person voice-over.
Although Scorsese is 71 years old, 
his style has not suffered. Voice-over is a huge element to how the story is told, reminiscent of “Goodfellas” (1990), when Ray Liotta narrates the life of Henry Hill with wise guy voice-overs. Although Scorsese’s use of voice-over has been heavily criticized, it allows the audience to get in the mind of the charismatic crook and into the feverish roller coaster that he is shackled to.
DiCaprio isn’t the only actor that 
had a stellar performance. Matthew McConaughey plays the role of Mark Hanna, Belfort’s Quaalude-popping, excessive, masturbating boss. McConaughey’s personality and infectiously witty demeanor steals the scene from DiCaprio with his satire of life on Wall Street. Jonah Hill also gives the performance of a lifetime as Donnie Azoff, Belfort’s right-hand man. This is the best per-formance that Jonah Hill has given since “Moneyball” (2011), proving he is a versatile actor.As one of the most highly antici-
pated movies of the year, “The Wolf of Wall Street” is nothing you have ever seen — unless your life con-sisted of securities fraud, hookers, blow and “morphine, because it’s awesome.”

No. 10 Florida handled Southeastern Conference bot-
tom-dweller South Carolina 74-58 on Wednesday night 
in the O’Connell Center, but a right ankle sprain to senior 
point guard Scottie Wilbekin put a damper on the Gators’ 
program record-tying 24th straight home victory.
Wilbekin left the game with 2:39 remaining after injur-
ing his right ankle — the one he injured on Dec. 2 against 
UConn — on a missed layup attempt. He could not put any 
weight on his ankle and needed UF trainers to help him to the locker room. 
The severity of Wilbekin’s injury is unknown, and he is 
questionable for Florida’s game at Arkansas on Saturday, 
coach Billy Donovan said. Wilbekin will miss the Gators’ 
practice today and will be re-evaluated by trainers on Fri-day. 
“He was driving down the lane out of control,” Dono-
van said of the play. “There’s no movement. It’s early in the clock. He’s just got to do a better job.”
Florida had a sub waiting for Wilbekin before the senior 
suffered the sprain.
“It sucks, because it was around the end of the game 
that he went and did his little minor ankle sprain or what-ever it may be,” center Patric Young said. “But I think he’s going to all right.
“I talked to him afterward and he said he’s going to be 
OK.”
Before suffering his injury, Wilbekin was in the midst 
of a breakout game and finally ended a recent shooting slump. After shooting 11 of 35 from the field — including a 4-of-17 clip from beyond the arc — in his previous three contests, he shot 5 of 11 for a team-high 17 points against 
the Gamecocks in his team’s SEC opener.
In 34 minutes of action, Wilbekin made 3 of 6 three-
point attempts, notched three assists, did not turn the ball 
over and sunk all four of his free throws. 
Young and senior forward Casey Prather each chipped 
in 13 points for the Gators (12-2, 1-0 SEC).
Florida’s win was not as lopsided as last season’s result 
— the Gators beat the Gamecocks by 39 points last year in the O’Dome and held them to only 10 points at halftime. 
On Wednesday, South Carolina was within single digits of 
UF in the second half.
The Gators jumped out to a 14-1 advantage in the 
game’s first six minutes and led by as many as 18 points in the first half. South Carolina needed 9:23 to make its first 
field goal.
But over a span of 2:08 late in the half, USC responded with a 7-0 run to cut UF’s advantage to 34-21 at halftime.
Eventually, South Carolina trailed by only eight points 
5:09 into the second half as its 2-3 zone had Florida frus-
trated. Then, Florida increased its lead to 15 points thanks to a 12-5 run capped off by an alley-oop dunk by Dorian 
Finney-Smith.
Utilizing a full-court press, the Gators forced the Game-
cocks to 21 turnovers on Wednesday. “It definitely benefitted us,” Prather said of UF’s full-
court press. “That’s like playing to our strengths, using our 
guys who are athletic and quick in speed anticipating.” 
Florida shot only 5 of 19 from three-point range but 21 
of 26 from inside the arc. 
UF’s win is its sixth straight and 24th consecutive vic-
tory at home, tying a streak held from March 1, 2006, to Nov. 20, 2007.

GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
Through Florida’s ongoing winning 
streak, one thing has remained constant. 
Redshirt sophomore Cassie Peoples has 
been spearheading the charge as the 
Gators’ starting point guard since Decem-ber began. 
The transition to starter occurred dur-
ing Florida’s trip to the Bahamas for the Junkanoo Jam. Peoples played a season-high 28 minutes in the loss against Illinois State, only to top that with 35 minutes in a 
win against Oregon State — the first game 
of the current eight-game win streak. 
She has averaged 33.6 minutes per 
game in those eight games. In the prior seven contests, Peoples averaged just un-
der 21 minutes. 
“One of our AAU coaches was at the 
game (against Kentucky), Jack Givens, a Kentucky great,” assistant 
coach David Lowery said. “Jack watched and told 
me, ‘David, she’s grown 
so much.’”
Peoples accounts her 
growth this season to simply being able to play 
on a consistent basis. 
“Just getting my timing back,” she said. 
“I haven’t played a game in forever, so it’s going to take time to get timing back in a 
game.” 
Peoples’ collegiate career had been 
riddled with injuries; she has not played regularly since her high school days at San Antonio (Texas) Cypress-Fairbanks. 
“It’s been a matter of figuring out ex-
actly what coach Butler wants in her sys-
tem and what she wants to do with her of-
fense,” she said. “That’s the biggest thing, Third-year point guard making most of rare playing time

new look in 2014. 
Offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease is gone, taking his pro-style 
offense with him. Replacing them are Kurt Roper and an up-tempo spread offense. 
Roper, who comes to UF after 
coaching at Duke for six seasons, will have a lot of talent to work with in the 2014 recruiting class. The class currently has 12 commits 
on offense, including one quarter-
back, three wide receivers and six offensive lineman. Some of them have the potential to make an im-
mediate impact. 
The Gator wide receiving corps 
needs a lot of improvement. Flor-
ida ﬁ  nished 2013 ranked 116th in passing yards per completion. 
Current wide receiver commit 
Ermon Lane could turn things around quickly. 
Lane is the No. 6 receiver in the 
2014 class, according to Rivals.com. However, he has wavered on his commitment in the past month, especially after running back Dalvin Cook ﬂ  ipped from 
Florida to Florida State last week. 
Lane said during the Under Ar-mour practices that he and Cook have always wanted to play to-
gether.
On Wednesday afternoon, Lane 
posted a picture on his Instagram account (@lane_to_live) of himself 
wearing a Florida State track suit. If Muschamp can keep him com-mitted, it will be great news for 
Florida’s passing game. 
If Lane does decommit, UF 
has just two other receivers in the 
class — Moral Stephens and Ryan 
Sousa. Neither crack the top 20 in 
Rivals’ position rankings. 
There are also two three-star 
tight ends in the class — Deandre Goolsby and C’yontai Lewis — 
who will try to revamp the unde-
veloped position for Florida. 
The Rivals No. 2 quarter-
back from 2014, Will Grier, has a 
chance to get reps as a true fresh-
man because of his impressive high school campaign. However, Grier, who is listed at under 190 pounds, will need to put on some 
weight before running the spread. 
He will likely redshirt in 2014, but if Jeff Driskel does not stay healthy, Grier might have to play 
early in his career.
The position with the most ob-
vious lack of depth for the Gators 
is the offensive line. Florida has just ﬁ  ve offensive lineman with 
starting experience returning in 2014. 
UF’s best commit from this 
group is David Sharpe, whose 
6-foot-8, 275-pound frame makes him a menacing offensive tackle.  Sharpe played left tackle in high 
school, and his size and improved 
footwork could potentially earn him a starting role in 2014. 
Last season, redshirt junior 
Max Garcia needed to move from his natural left guard position to 
left tackle after Tyler Moore suf-
fered a season-ending arm injury in November. Moving Garcia back to left guard could give Sharpe a 
prime shot at getting meaningful 
reps at tackle. 
The newest member of Florida’s 
class is Rivals three-star offensive tackle Kavaris Harkless. Harkless 
was previously committed to Lou-
isville and was set to enroll this week until news of Charlie Strong going to Texas broke. 
He decided to enroll at UF in-
stead and enrolled on Wednes-day. Harkless is a versatile athlete who can play both left and right guard, as well as tackle. Harkless 
is a skilled run blocker, but he 
needs more consistency in pass blocking.  
Nolan Kelleher, Rivals’ 29th-
ranked tackle, will ﬁ  t best at guard. Kelleher has good instincts and run blocks well, but can im-prove getting off the ball quicker. Kelleher has already enrolled.  
Two important prospects, Isa-
iah McKenzie and Jeff Jones, will both make ofﬁ  cial visits on Jan. 24. McKenzie can serve as in-surance if Lane decommits, and Jones, whose stock is high after an MVP performance at the Under 
Armour game, can make up for 
UF losing Cook.THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Cassie Peoples drives down the lane during Florida’s 88-77 win against 
North Florida on Nov. 10, 2013, in the O’Connell Center. 
Peoples playing key role in Gators’ eight-game win streak
as far as being able to improve, is just learning 
the system.”
Along with more minutes, Peoples’ rapid 
maturation has also been a contributing fac-tor to her recent success. A point guard holds the most responsibility of any position on the ﬂ  oor, acting as a general directing their play-
ers when on offense.
“I think one of the things that has given her 
an opportunity to grow is that she has accept-
ed the role of being a point guard, accepted the role of trying to get her teammates to follow 
her on the ﬂ  oor,” Lowery said. “I know that’s 
something Amanda (Butler)’s on her about all the time.”
Frequently, one can look to the bench and 
see Butler adamantly critiquing Peoples. Vein-popping and animated ﬁ  nger pointing is not an uncommon scene. 
“When something goes wrong, I’m the 
ﬁ  rst one to hear about it because I’m the point 
guard,” Peoples said. “She’s basically telling 
me to control my team, navigate the team when I’m on the court.”
Added Butler: “Cassie is playing the most basketball that she’s played since she was in high school. I think it’s just a natural evolution of a young player — seeing them gain conﬁ  -
dence with the more minutes they get, the 
more game experiences they have. She does a great job of post-game studying ﬁ  lm, analyz-ing things she did well and things she must do better. She’s great at being coached in the 
middle of a game, too.”
Butler, Peoples and Florida (12-3, 2-0 
Southeastern Conference) are set to square off against a tough conference rival in Arkansas 
(14-1, 1-1 SEC) tonight in the O’Connell Cen-ter. The Gators should be well-prepared for the Razorbacks, as Arkansas is a press-heavy team — similar to Florida’s last two SEC op-
ponents: Mississippi State and Kentucky.
“Tom (Collen) is a great coach and one of 
the strongest things he does is the level of con-
sistency,” Butler said. “It’s going to be good 
to be back at home, but we’re going to have a 
tough challenge.”W-HOOPS , from page 14
