Alligator Staff Report
Each time the Century Tower bell marks the 
next period, students enter classrooms wondering 
if they should don or ditch a mask. 
Since Wednesday, UF no longer recommends 
or expects students to wear masks but welcomes 
them to mask if they choose to. UF released new 
masking guidance due to a decline in local and 
nationwide COVID-19 case numbers. 
While some dropped their masks the day after 
the revisions, others stayed cautious. Large lecture 
halls have a pattern of bare faces intermixed with 
only eyes peeking out from above masks.
The CDC released updated pandemic guidance 
in February. The new guidelines advised people 
in counties with low or medium COVID-19 
hospitalizations that they no longer needed to 
wear masks.
Six days before UF changed the masking 
policy, Alachua County’s CDC status was updated 
to medium community level. A county’s level is 
determined by new COVID-19 admissions, the 
percentage of hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 
patients and the total new COVID-19 cases per 
100,000 population in the last seven days. Despite dropping positivity and new policies, 
many UF classrooms have generally maintained 
the same appearance.  
Steve Noll, UF history professor, hasn’t noticed 
a difference in his classes so far. Most of his 
students still choose to wear masks, though he 
expects more maskless students soon. 
“The biggest difference is UF had to print off 
all new signs and take down the old ones and put 
them up,” he said.
As Florida trended better with the pandemic, 
Noll assumed mask mandates would change. 
He said it’s an appropriate time to move in this 
direction, but thought the university should have 
released a statement thanking people for masking 
this long.
“I just think there should have been something 
in there about thanking those people who were 
masked for helping keep numbers down,” he said.
His only goal throughout the pandemic has 
been to keep his students safe, so he will still offer 
classes via Zoom and thanks any students who 
continue to mask.
While classrooms have been split with masked 
and unmasked students for months, some are

Popular websites and study 
tools like Chegg and Course Hero 
have been a saving grace for 
many students’ grades. But these 
online tools have opened the 
door to a world of trouble that 
students may be unaware of. 
Beyond normal repercussions 
for cheating and honor code 
violations, students can be 
sued for sharing course content 
violating copyright laws. 
David Berkovitz, Chapman 
University professor, filed 
a lawsuit March 10 against 
unknown students for posting his 
exam prompts on Course Hero, 
a subscription-based website 
where students share content 
from their college classes, 
according to The Washington 
Post. 
Berkovitz’s lawyer, Marc 
Hankin, told The Washington 
Post the professor is not trying 
to bankrupt his students, he just 
wants to prevent cheating in his 
class. 
This case is the first time 
Adriana Kanarek, a 21-year-old 
UF biology junior, has heard legal 
repercussions can come from 
posting content on websites. 
Kanarek remembers more 
people using these websites 
when she was a freshman, but 
said she doesn't know too many 
people who use them now. 
In one of her physics classes 
in the Fall, a professor found 
a student posting the answers 
online during the exam, which 
ended with serious consequences 
for the student, she said. 
If a student is accused of 
violating UF’s Honor Code 
policy, they have to attend an 
honor court hearing where a 
panel decides the student’s 
consequence. 
Kanarek believes people who 
post content on sites probably 
are aware of repercussions for 
cheating.
“If more people knew that suing was a possibility, there 
would be less of it or people 
would try to go under different 
domains and still try to do it but 
in a hidden demeanor,” she said.
Users’ identities are protected 
under their privacy policies, 
Jamie Soper, Course Hero 
spokesperson, wrote in an email. 
Course Hero must receive a 
subpoena before releasing any 
information, like the names 
of users posting the infringing 
content, to the copyright holder. 
The website uses an advanced 
filtering technology to identify, 
prevent and remove known 
infringing content on their 
platform, Soper wrote.
“Course Hero does not 
tolerate copyright infringement 
of any kind and employs a 
range of preventative measures, 
investigation and enforcement 
policies,” she wrote. “Our 
policies include swift content 
removal, prevention of infringing 
content being reuploaded to the 
platform and removing repeat 
offenders.”
It is no secret that exams, 
homework and study materials 
tend to make their way to these 
websites, said Alex Angerhofer, 
a UF chemistry professor.
“I think you almost expect 
that sort of thing,” Angerhofer 
said. “It’s part of the educational 
environment that we live in.” 
Professors encourage their 
students to use outside resources, 
but cheating is never tolerated, 
he said. 
To Angerhofer, cheating 
doesn’t pay off. When students 
do cheat it doesn’t end up 
improving their grade, he said. 
It may get them an A, but they 
don’t learn the material and 
cannot apply it. 
“In the end I think there is 
some karma out there that if you 
do that, you eventually will have 
to pay the price,” Angerhofer 
said. 
Cheating is expected, said 
Steven Noll, a UF history pr. 
However, the internet and the requirement that professors must 
post their syllabi and textbooks 
makes it far easier to do so, 
he said. Because the syllabi 
are available to the public, 
information about the classes is 
easier to find.
The Chapman University 
professor’s aggressive action to 
try and prevent sites like Course 
Hero from violating the integrity 
of classes is good, Noll said. 
With classes more commonly 
structured for an online setting 
due to the pandemic, Noll said, 
cheating and websites like 
Course Hero have become a 
greater problem because courses 
are becoming more like public 
record.
“I don’t necessarily think it’s 
more of a problem …[on] the 
student end,” he said. “I think 
it’s more of a problem from the 
administrative, governmental 
end.” 
It becomes a question of who 
owns the coursework, he said. 
Noll created an online version 
of American History since 1877, 
a common general education 
requirement for UF Online. Even 
though he crafted the class, he 
was told UF owns it. 
In his case, Noll wasn’t 
allowed to copyright his course, 
whereas the Chapman University 
professor did have the rights to 
his class. This demonstrates the 
difference between a public and 
private university, he said.
“I think that public universities 
have to behold governmental 
issues,” he said. “At some level 
the assumption is that you are, 
as a state employee, responsible 
not only to your students but 
also the state of Florida.”

being held without a bond that was previous -
ly $320,000 and is charged with homicide, 
driving while under the influence, reckless 
driving and hit-and-run. 
The holiday, traditionally a joyful celeb -
ration of life, will now be observed by Shar -
ma’s family and friends as a remembrance 
of his life.
Gainesville has developed a notorious 
reputation for unsafe pedestrian conditions 
and multiple student deaths. The families 
of Maggie Paxton, Sophia Lambert and De -
nise Griffiths now live with the tribulations 
of loss, and they relive these tragedies with 
each hit-and-run that occurs in the city.
Sharma’s family now mourns across the 
world in Faridabad, where the UF computer 
science exchange student was born and rai -
sed.
He couldn’t walk across campus without 
running into the friends he made in his class -
rooms and study groups, said his best friend, 
Drishtant Purkayastha. They met on the first 
day of their freshman year of college. They 
spent every day together until Sharma mo -
ved to Gainesville.
“He had this effect on everyone he met,” 
the 21-year-old said. “He was a light in eve -
ryone’s darkest moments.”
Prateek shaped him into the person he is 
now.
“Every little thing, whatever happened to 
me, I used to share with him,” he said. “He 
used to give me advice. I like to believe we 
changed each other for the better. We were 
brothers.”
They spoke almost every day, even on 
March 17, despite the nearly 10-hour time 
difference.“I said … ‘I’ll talk to you tomorrow,’” 
Purkayastha said. “Tomorrow never came.” 
Remembering Sharma’s high-spirited 
presence, Archit Ratan, Sharma’s older cou -
sin-brother — an Indian-English term that 
refers to a male cousin that assumes a brot -
herly relationship — was overwhelmed with 
happy memories. 
“He was always smiling,” Ratan said. “He 
never said ‘no’ to anyone.”
Sharma loved to listen to Punjabi music, 
travel and play soccer when he was not fid -
geting with gadgets or crafting codes. 
Following in his father and grandfather’s 
engineering footsteps, Sharma attended 
Amity University Noida in 2018 pursuing a 
Bachelor’s of Technology in computer scien -
ce and engineering.
Although he loved Amity, Sharma wanted 
to take advantage of its study abroad options 
for his last semester of college. Moving to 
Gainesville at the beginning of this year, he 
planned to complete the last semester of his 
undergraduate education at UF and enroll in 
a graduate school program.
He envisioned what his education, career 
and future looked like, working toward re -
ceiving a master’s degree from a renowned 
college in the United States. 
Over the summer of 2021, he interned 
at both TISPL and The Sparks Foundation, 
working as a data science and information 
technology intern. 
In 2020, he and Purkayastha also created 
a functional Android application that could 
track COVID-19 cases across India. With not 
enough kits to test its whole population, In -
dia relied on apps like these to track positive 
cases and people who were in close contact 
with those infected.
He was motivated to volunteer in In -
dia, too, working with The Earth Saviours Foundation, a nongovernmental organizati -
on that works toward improving living con -
ditions for underprivileged civilians and ad -
vocates for environmental stewardship.
“He was very ambitious with all his 
dreams,” Ratan said. “If this would have not 
happened, the story would be something dif -
ferent.”
Sharma’s friends and family hope to 
spread awareness about his life and legacy, 
creating an Instagram account in his honor. 
They want justice for his wrongful death.
“There is really not enough news covera -ge about this … which really hurts to see,” 
Purkayastha wrote.

an investigation tactic used by 
police, Johnson admitted he was 
aware of the accuser’s drunken 
state.
The incident took place during 
a party at Canopy Apartments in 
Gainesville, where Johnson lives, 
according to police records. The 
party took place after the team’s 
return from an away victory 
against the Georgia Bulldogs in 
Athens. Johnson’s accuser asked 
to use the restroom but doesn’t 
recall walking to the residence. 
The accuser does recall 
Johnson assaulting her. 
Two witnesses reported that 
the accuser was in Johnson’s 
apartment for about 35 minutes 
before returning. When the 
accuser returned, witnesses report 
she was unable to stand on her 
own and was incoherent. 
The accusation against Johnson 
is one of many to do with sexual 
violence in Gainesville. In 2020, 
128 sexual assault cases were 
reported to the Gainesville Police 
Department. 
Florida’s most recent and 
prominent sexual assault 
allegations came from members 
of the football team, former wide 
reciever Antonio Callaway and 
quarterback Treon Harris. In August of 2016, Callaway and 
Harris were accused of sexual 
assault to the UF student conduct 
office, not the police. 
A Title IX hearing was 
conducted for both cases. The 
university was under scrutiny 
after appointing a third-party 
hearing officer Jake Schnickel, 
an attorney, former UF athlete 
and Gator booster to represent 
Callaway.
Similar to many sexual assult 
cases in Gainesville, the case blew 
over and Callaway went on to 
appear in 12 games for the Gators 
in 2016, while Harris transfered 
to Tennessee State University in 
2017. It wasn’t until a report in 
July of 2017 that it was revealed 
UF had spent over $170,000 in 
legal fees to back Callaway. 
Johnson, a Norfolk, Virginia, 
native hasn’t played in a game 
since collapsing during a contest 
against Florida State Dec. 12, 
2020. He most recently took the 
court for a ceremonious tipoff on 
senior night against Kentucky. 
Johnson is on track to graduate in 
May of 2022. 
The police report states that 
Johnson and his accuser had 
consensual intercourse as recently 
as August 2021, but the accuser 
ended the relationship. 
Twenty-eight student athletes 
have been granted eligibility to transfer and play elsewhere 
after being disciplined for a 
sexual assault crime by their 
university, according to a USA 
Today investigative report. Five 
more have been granted eligibility 
despite being convicted in the 
court of law. 
In a study involving three 
dozen high-level NCAA Division 
I programs (including Florida), 
student athletes make up less 
than 3% of the total student 
body, but account for 9% of 
all sexual offenses. In a 2019 
survey conducted by UF, 30% of 
undergraduate women reported 
they had been sexually assaulted 
via physical force or inability to 
consent.
Johnson’s lawyer, Ron 
Kozlowski, made a brief statement 
to Edgar Thompson of the Orlando 
Sentinel. 
“I’m confident once the facts 
come out, no charges will be 
filed,” Kozlowski said. “Keyontae 
didn’t commit a crime, didn’t 
do anything wrong. That will be 
apparent once the facts are out.”
A spokesperson from The 
University Athletic Association 
declined to comment on the 
allegation.

As Floridians wait for Gov. 
Ron DeSantis to sign an abortion 
banning bill, activist groups are 
organizing in retaliation, hosting 
protests and holding abortion 
information sessions.
This bill bans abortion after 
15 weeks of pregnancy and has 
raised alarm among people with 
reproductive capabilities. The 
ban would allow for exceptions 
involving “serious risk” to 
the pregnant person and fetal 
abnormality with no exceptions 
for rape or incest. 
Now, the closest place for 
Floridians to access abortion 
after 15 weeks is North Carolina.
Jianna D’Addario, president 
of UF Planned Parenthood 
Generation Action, organized an 
event at the Civic Media Center 
to provide abortion information 
in Florida Wednesday. 
“We had that event to connect 
folks with resources so that we 
can all kind of have each other’s 
back as we try to navigate life 
under such restrictive policies,” D’Addario said. 
About 15 people gathered at the 
Generation Action presentation, 
which advised people with 
pregnancy capabilities to take 
pregnancy tests frequently and 
directed them toward local 
abortion providers like Bread & 
Roses and All Women’s Health 
Center. 
D’Addario assured attendees 
the abortion ban isn’t based on 
medically accurate information. 
“All it does is put pregnant 
people on a really strict timeline 
for when they can be able to 
make these decisions and when 
they can start accessing care,” 
they said. “For a lot of folks that’s 
already difficult, for communities 
of color, for queer communities 
… those communities already are 
receiving discriminatory health 
care.”
Nilufer Akalin, UF Center 
for Gender, Sexualities, and 
Women’s Studies Research 
lecturer, said the last several 
decades saw safe, legal abortion 
become more accessible to 
women globally. However, in the 
US, it seems legal frameworks are increasingly limiting access 
to abortion.
An abortion ban could also 
lead to clinic closures, which 
increases the travel distance to get 
an abortion, Akalin said. Those 
without financial capabilities 
or access to transportation for 
travel would struggle to access 
abortion care. 
“There has been all this work 
and also a feminist movement 
that liberalized access to 
abortion,” Akalin said. “What we 
are seeing in the US is a reversed 
direction.”
Texas, Arizona and Virginia 
implemented six-week abortion 
bans and Mississippi has a 15-
week ban.
“We’ve seen that historically 
these laws do not result in fewer 
abortions,” she said. ”They 
compel a woman to risk their 
lives and health by seeking out 
unsafe abortion care.”
The World Health Organization 
says lack of access to safe and 
timely abortion care is a critical 
public health and human rights 
issue. Each year, 4.7% to 13.2% 
of maternal deaths are because of unsafe abortion.
The WHO site lists unsafe 
abortion health risks such as 
haemorrhage, infection, uterine 
perforation and damage to the 
genital tract and internal organs.
Having a kid is a life changing 
event, Dr. Akalin said. People 
should be able to decide whether 
they are ready for this change.
The ban will impact working 
people, non-English speakers 
and those without the funds to 
get to North Carolina, D’Addario 
said. These barriers reinforce 
hierarchies of power within our 
society.
National Women’s Liberation, 
a feminist organization working 
for more freedom, opposes 
not only the Florida bill but all 
abortion bans. The organization 
is open to women and trans 
people who do not benefit from 
the patriarchy. 
Stephanie Kollgaard, chair of 
the NWL New York City chapter, 
said the group demands access 
to abortions and birth control 
without restrictions or coercion.
“This ban is beyond 
concerning,” Kollgaard said. “It’s devastating for people in Florida 
who need abortions.”
The bill, she said, is less about 
protecting fetal personhood or 
reducing infant mortality and 
more about controlling peoples’ 
reproductive lives.
This organization partnered 
with others like Planned 
Parenthood and Floridians For 
Reproductive Freedom to host 
speak outs and rallies against the 
abortion ban. 
As Floridians wait for 
DeSantis to sign the bill, NWL 
will flood his office with phone 
calls pressuring him to veto it, 
Kollgaard said.
The organization launched a 
pledge to aid and abet abortion 
in Florida. The pledge received 
the support of local groups like 
Alachua County Labor Coalition, 
which shared it in a newsletter. 
NWL is working to get signatures 
to send the pledge to the governor 
before the bill is signed.
“Just as an additional way of 
saying: ‘Hell no, we’re not going 
to stand for that,’” Kollgaard 
said.

volunteering where these kids 
are really sick,” Steinman said. 
“There's definitely a reason 
for me to keep myself healthy 
because I know what I'm doing 
is important for them.”
She keeps these children in 
mind when she masks up in 
class and outside UF.
Some students, however, 
are relieved masks are no 
longer recommended in their 
extracurriculars. 
Ashley Blum, a 19-year-old 
UF acting sophomore, has been 
required to wear a mask during performances.
On Wednesday, following 
the new mask guidelines, her 
classmates performing in the 
major’s current production, 
“Stupid F-----g Bird,” 
unanimously voted to perform 
without masks.
“As an acting major whose 
performance is very much 
dependent on our facial 
expressions, it was very 
emotional and exciting in class 
today to see people perform 
without a mask on their face,” 
Blum said. “I feel like our 
education will strengthen so 
much.”
Before the new guidelines 
were in place, the students 
in all the stage productions 
required wearing a mask while 
performing. 
Acting students choose to 
wear masks in class and while 
watching performances, only 
taking them off when they are 
onstage, Blum said.
Other students feel the need 
to continue wearing a mask for 
their own protection.
Tanvi Mathews, a 20-year-
old UF information systems 
sophomore, urges people to 
continue to keep themselves 
and others safe from COVID-19, 
despite the relaxed mask 
guidelines. 
“I think that where we’re 
headed as a country and as a 
whole, we’re getting to herd 
immunity,” Mathews said. “We’re getting there, but we 
need to make sure that we’re 
maintaining social distancing 
at least in crowded areas like 
buses or classrooms.”
To reach herd immunity, 
80% to 90% of a population are 
required to have had infection of 
COVID-19 or vaccination. About 
78.6% of the United States has 
had the first dose of the vaccine.
Mathews believes UF’s 
relaxed guidelines discourage 
mask use.
“I feel like the moment 
you say that masks are not 
mandatory anymore, everyone’s 
really just never gonna wear 
them again,” she said.
Mathews will continue to 
wear a mask inside classrooms 
and other indoor places with 
low air circulation.
Some UF students are not too 
concerned about their school’s 
new guidance as case positivity 
has decreased. 
Katherine Panagoulias, 
a 19-year-old English and 
computer science sophomore, 
said she doesn’t mind the 
changes UF has made to its 
masking policy. She still sees 
many students masking and 
social distancing.
“If there are bigger classrooms 
and people are spaced out also, 
it doesn’t feel threatening,” 
Panagoulias said. 
Two years ago, she wore her 
mask everywhere. Today, she 
often isn’t wearing a mask and thinks many people don’t fear 
COVID-19 anymore. 
“It’s been around for a while,” 
Panagoulias said. “I guess it kind 
of lost its threatening presence.”
Panagoulias never caught 
COVID-19. She’s still wary of 
the day she will test positive, 
but until then, she will keep 
her distance, wash her hands 
and hope people continue doing 
their own research to decide 
how to best protect themselves. 
Outside of UF campus, mask 
mandates are also ending.
The Alachua County 
Commission ended its mask 
mandate for county employees 
Feb. 22. Weekly testing is also 
no longer required. Alachua County 
spokesperson Mark Sexton said 
masks will also not be required 
for people attending County 
Commission Meetings. It's now 
an individual’s responsibility to 
decide whether they want to be 
masked, he said.
“We get weekly reports 
from the Department of Health 
and every week, for the last 
six weeks, the numbers have 
been going down dramatically,” 
Sexton said. “Our vaccination 
rate is over 70%.”

NIGHTCLUB OWNER, DRAG 
QUEENS AND STUDENTS 
REFLECT ON THE GROWTH OF 
REPRESENTATION
By Amanda Friedman & 
Jared T eitel 
Avenue Staff Writers 
Illuminated by strobes of neon 
lights, a swaying crowd fixates their 
eyes on the dance floor. A spotlight 
shines as a performer dressed head-
to-toe in sparkles struts through the 
crowd. The first verse of “Break 
Free” by Ariana Grande begins to 
blare through the club’s speakers 
causing the audience to cheer with 
excitement.
This is a typical night at Univer -
sity Club.
The downtown nightclub, lo -
cated at 18 E University Ave, be -
came Gainesville’s first gay club af -
ter opening its doors more than 30 
years ago. It’s widely recognized as 
the heart of Gainesville’s LGBTQ+ 
nightlife. 
Although Gainesville is largely 
known for Gator Nation and its natu -
ral beauty, in the city lives a thriving 
and historically rich LGBTQ+ night -
life scene, with University Club and 
the growing local drag scene as its 
anchors. 
University Club’s impact
Mark Spangler, co-owner of Uni -
versity Club, opened the bar in April 
1990 because he wanted to create 
an environment where queer people could be themselves, he said. 
“Everyone will tell me when they 
come through town: ‘Thanks for cre -
ating a safe space for us [LGBTQ+ 
people] for all these years,’” Span -
gler said.
As LGBTQ+ people still faced 
frequent violence and discrimination 
within their communities in the ’90s, 
there were regular attacks on Univer -
sity Club after it first opened. UF fra -
ternities used to throw glass bottles 
at the club’s back entrance. 
However, with the progression 
of the nationwide gay rights move -
ment, Gainesville’s current nightlife 
scene is much more inclusive of the 
LGBTQ+ community, and fraternity 
members now come to University 
Club for a fun night out, Spangler 
said. 
“We’ve paved the way for them 
[LGBTQ people] to be able to just 
go anywhere in town and be them -
selves most of the time and without 
an issue,” Spangler said. 
University Club has also played 
an integral role in the growth of 
Gainesville’s drag scene by jump -
starting the careers of many local 
drag queens. 
The late William Moorehead, bet -
ter known by his drag persona Lady 
Pearl, was largely responsible for in -
troducing drag shows to Gainesville, 
Spangler said.
During the ’90s AIDS crisis, LG -
BTQ+ organizations commonly paid 
tribute to those who died from the 
virus through fundraisers. In 1991, 
Pearl went to Spangler with the idea 
to organize a drag show and AIDS benefit — drawing a huge crowd and 
raising roughly $10,000 for the North 
Central Florida AIDS Network. 
University Club continues to use 
its platform to combat the stigma 
surrounding AIDS and support the 
local queer community by providing 
HIV testing information inside the 
nightclub in collaboration with The 
Unspoken Treasure Society, a foun -
dation that aims to support transgen -
der communities. 
From then on, Pearl started host -
ing weekly themed drag shows at 
University Club. Her Thursday night 
“Pussycat Cabaret” comedy show 
was particularly popular with soror -
ity girls, Spangler said. 
“She was hilarious,” Spangler 
said.
Eventually, the success of Pearl’s 
shows led to the decision to host 
more weekly drag shows. Now, Uni -
versity Club has drag shows hosted 
by different local drag queens almost 
every night of the week.
To highlight new talent, the 
nightclub hosts talent nights on the 
last Wednesday of the month and its 
annual Miss UC Newcomer Pageant. 
Drag queens of all experience levels 
are eligible to participate, Spangler 
said.
Jianna D’Addario, a 22-year-old 
psychology senior, attended her first 
gay club and drag show at Univer -
sity Club since living in conservative 
Panama City, Florida. 
“I do remember the full reveal 
moment,” she said, remembering 
how the drag performers changed 
from glowing gowns to tight unitards in Fall 2017. “The performance was 
amazing — super high energy.” 
Since that night, D’Addario knew 
Gainesville would finally allow her 
the space to express her sexual iden -
tity. 
“Moving to Gainesville and ac -
tually seeing queerness for the first 
time was really instrumental in my 
development as a queer person,” 
she said. 
However, despite the impact 
the city has on her capacity to feel 
safe as a queer individual, the line 
between queer and straight spaces 
has become more and more blurred as clubs like UC foster the growth of 
cisgender, heterosexual patronage. 
The last time Sydney “Squid” 
Swarthman, administrative assistant 
for Pride Student Union, enjoyed 
an evening at UC was for her best 
friend’s birthday in January.

THE AVENUE STAFF GIVES THEIR 
TAKE ON WHO SHOULD BRING 
HOME THE GOLD THIS YEAR
The Avenue Staff
After a year of momentous musical mo -
ments, the Grammys has returned to deliver 
its prestigious accolades to the artists who de -
serve to take home the gold — or not. 
The Avenue staff teamed up to give our 
breakdown of six Grammys categories — Re -
cord of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of 
the Year, Best New Artist, Best Pop Solo Per -
formance and Best Rap Album — giving both 
our Grammys predicted winner and who we 
think deserves to win. Musical talent, lyricism, 
popularity and even drama are all on display 
in our analyses. 
This year’s Grammys are already proving to be no stranger to controversy: a Kanye perfor -
mance ban, an unexpected Tweet of resigna -
tion from Doja Cat and a months-long COVID-
related postponement of the ceremony to the 
now-confirmed April 3 date. Music’s biggest 
night is shaping up to be an interesting one, 
and the Avenue staff is ready for it all. 
Record of the Year
By Amanda Friedman 
Predicted Grammys Pick : “drivers license” 
by Olivia Rodrigo
Amanda’s Pick : “Happier than Ever” by 
Billie Eilish
The Record of The Year category awards 
artists, producers and engineers for the year’s 
best recording — with previous winners in -
cluding “Hotel California” by The Eagles and 
Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep.” 
Front-runners for this year include “Leave 
The Door Open” by Silk Sonic, “Kiss Me More” by Doja Cat featuring SZA, “drivers license” by 
Olivia Rodrigo and “Happier Than Ever” by 
Billie Eilish. 
Although Eilish has taken home the award 
for the past two years, the 20-year-old’s pop-
punk track of emotional turmoil “Happier 
Than Ever” should win the 2022 Grammys’ 
Record of The Year. 
What makes “Happier Than Ever” stand 
out among the other nominations is the ton -
al shift from a soft, soulful ballad to a full-on 
rock anthem midway through the record. The 
song begins with the luscious strumming of a 
classical guitar accompanied by Eilish’s jazzy 
vocals. Two and a half minutes into the song, 
the classical guitar is abandoned and replaced 
with an electric guitar, signifying a shift from 
sadness and confusion to pure anger.
Eilish’s previous velvety vocals are now 
shaky and aggressive as if she is about to re -
lease a tidal wave of built-up emotion. By the 
three-minute mark, the song is overtaken by 
combative vocals and fierce rock elements. 
With lines like “Cuz, I’d never treat you this 
sh***y/You made me hate this city,” being a stand-out and internet-viral lyric from the 
track, Eilish delivers a heart-wrenching an -
them that anyone going through a bad breakup 
would want to scream along to. 
Many critics say this track is Eilish’s best 
work and marks her strongest vocal perfor -
mance. Although I prefer Eilish’s more mini -
malistic, full-on piano and guitar ballads, I 
think this is by far Eilish at her most experi -
mental. Overall, the innovative juxtaposition 
of a soothing ballad beside classic rock ele -
ments makes this record outshine the other 
nominations. 
However, one cannot deny the global suc -
cess of Olivia Rodrigo’s “drivers license.” The 
song has over one billion streams on Spotify 
and has broken countless records. Rodrigo also 
expresses exceptional vocal and songwriting 
talent on the heartbreak ballad. Therefore, she 
is most likely to take home this year’s Grammy 
for Record of The Year.

SUS SERES QUERIDOS DICEN QUE 
ERA UN HIJO, HERMANO Y AMIGO 
CARISMÁTICO Y AMOROSO CON UNA 
SONRISA CONTAGIOSA
Por Carissa Allen
Escritora del Caimán
Traducido Por Marian Hernandez
Escritora del Caimán 
 
El festival indio favorito de Prateek Sharma 
era Holi. La fiesta celebra la llegada de la pri -
mavera, los nuevos comienzos y el triunfo del 
bien sobre el mal.
Antes de mudarse a Gainesville, celebró el 
vívido y alegre festival en las calles de Farid -
abad, India, rociándose a sí mismo y a sus 
seres queridos con agua y polvos coloridos 
tradicionales.
En la víspera de Holi de este año, Sharma 
caminó por la acera de Southwest 34th Street 
hasta el mercado para comprar gujiya, un 
manjar popular de Holi.
Sharma fue golpeado fatalmente y asesi -
nado el 17 de marzo. Tenía 21 años.
James O'Reilly, de 19 años, está acusado de 
atropellar a Sharma mientras conducía ebrio. 
O'Reilly está recluido en la cárcel del condado 
de Alachua, en espera de juicio después de 
declararse inocente. Está detenido sin una fi -
anza que anteriormente era de $320.000 y está 
acusado de homicidio, conducción bajo la in -
fluencia, conducción imprudente y atropello y 
fuga.
La festividad, tradicionalmente una alegre celebración de la vida ahora será observada 
por la familia y los amigos de Sharma como un 
recuerdo de su propia vida.
Gainesville ha desarrollado una reputación 
notoria por las condiciones inseguras de los 
peatones y las múltiples muertes de estudi -
antes. Las familias de Maggie Paxton, Sophia 
Lambert y Denise Griffiths ahora viven con las 
tribulaciones de la pérdida y reviven estas tra -
gedias con cada atropello y fuga que ocurre en 
la ciudad.
La familia de Sharma ahora está de luto 
al otro lado del mundo en Faridabad, donde 
nació y fue criado el estudiante de intercambio 
de informática de la UF.
No podía caminar por el campus sin encon -
trarse con los amigos que encontró en sus au -
las y grupos de estudio, dijo su mejor amigo, 
Drishtant Purkayastha. Se conocieron el primer 
día de su primer año universitario. Pasaron to -
dos los días juntos hasta que Sharma se mudó 
a Gainesville.
“Tenía este efecto en todos los que con -
ocía”, dijo el joven de 21 años. “Era una luz en 
los momentos más oscuros de todos”.
Prateek lo convirtió en la persona que es 
ahora.
“Cada pequeña cosa, cualquier cosa que 
me pasara, solía compartir con él, y él solía 
darme consejos”, dijo. “Me gusta creer que nos 
cambiamos mutuamente para mejorar como 
personas. Éramos hermanos.
Hablaron casi todos los días, incluso el 17 
de marzo, a pesar de la diferencia horaria de 
casi 10 horas.
“Dije… ‘Hablamos mañana’. Mañana nun -
ca llegó”, dijo Purkayastha.Al recordar la presencia animada de Shar -
ma, Archit Ratan, el primo-hermano mayor de 
Sharma, un término indio-inglés que se refiere 
a un primo varón que asume una relación fra -
ternal, se sintió abrumado por recuerdos feli -
ces.
“Él siempre estaba sonriendo”, dijo Ratan. 
"Él nunca le decía 'no' a nadie".
A Sharma le encantaba escuchar música 
punjabi, viajar y jugar fútbol cuando no estaba 
jugando con aparatos o elaborando códigos.
Siguiendo los pasos de ingeniería de su pa -
dre y su abuelo, Sharma asistió a Amity Uni -
versity Noida en 2018 para obtener una licenci -
atura en tecnología en informática e ingeniería.
Aunque amaba a Amity, Sharma quería 
aprovechar sus opciones de estudio en el ex -
tranjero para su último semestre de universi -
dad. Al mudarse a Gainesville a principios de 
este año, planeó completar el último semestre 
de su educación universitaria en la UF e inscri -
birse en un programa de posgrado.
Imaginó cómo sería su educación, carrera y 
futuro, trabajando para obtener una maestría 
de una universidad de renombre en los Estados 
Unidos.
Durante el verano de 2021, hizo una pas -
antía tanto en TISPL como en The Sparks 
Foundation, trabajando como pasante de cien -
cia de datos y tecnología informática.
En 2020, él y Purkayastha también crearon 
una aplicación funcional de Android que podía 
rastrear los casos de COVID-19 en India. Sin su -
ficientes kits para evaluar a toda su población, 
India confió en aplicaciones como estas para 
rastrear casos positivos y personas que estu -
vieron en contacto cercano con los infectados.También estaba 
motivado para ser 
voluntario en la In -
dia, trabajando con 
The Earth Saviors 
Foundation, una 
organización no 
gubernamental que 
trabaja para mejo -
rar las condiciones 
de vida de los civi -
les desfavorecidos y 
aboga por la admin -
istración ambiental.
“Era muy ambi -
cioso con todos sus sueños”, dijo Ratan. “Si 
esto no hubiera sucedido, la historia sería 
otra”.
Los amigos y la familia de Sharma esperan 
dar a conocer su vida y su legado creando una 
cuenta de Instagram en su honor. Quieren jus -
ticia por su muerte injusta.
“Realmente no hay suficiente cobertura de 
noticias sobre esto… lo que realmente duele 
ver”, escribió Purkayastha.
Su familia y amigos se reunieron en Farid -
abad el viernes por la tarde para una ceremo -
nia de cremación.
“Siempre amado, nunca olvidado, extra -
ñado para siempre”, escribió el anuncio de la 
ceremonia.

LOS ORGANIZADORES 
CREEN QUE EL PROYECTO 
DE LEY PERJUDICA LA 
SALUD Y LOS DERECHOS 
REPRODUCTIVOS
Por Lucille Lannigan
Escritora del Caimán
Traducido Por Marian 
Hernandez
Escritora del Caimán
Mientras los floridanos esperan 
que el gobernador Ron DeSantis 
firme un proyecto de ley que pro -
híba el aborto, los grupos activistas 
se están organizando en represalia, 
organizando protestas y realizan -
do sesiones informativas sobre el 
aborto.
Este proyecto de ley prohíbe el 
aborto después de las quince sema -
nas de embarazo y ha despertado 
alarma entre las personas con ca -
pacidades reproductivas. La pro -hibición permitiría excepciones que 
impliquen “un grave riesgo” para 
la persona embarazada y anom -
alías fetales sin excepciones por 
violación o incesto.
Ahora, el lugar más cercano 
para que los floridanos accedan al 
aborto después de las quince sema -
nas es Carolina del Norte.
Jianna D'Addario, presidenta de 
UF Planned Parenthood Generation 
Action(Acción de generación de 
planificación de familia de la UF), 
organizó un evento en el Civic Me -
dia Center (Centro cívico de medios 
de Gainesville) para brindar infor -
mación sobre el aborto en Florida 
el miércoles.
“Tuvimos ese evento para co -
nectar a las personas con recursos 
para que todos podamos apoyarnos 
unos a otros mientras tratamos de 
navegar el día a día bajo políticas 
tan restrictivas”, dijo D’Addario.
Alrededor de quince personas 
se reunieron en la presentación de 
Generation Action, que aconsejó a las personas con capacidades de 
embarazo que se hicieran pruebas 
de embarazo con frecuencia y las 
dirigió hacia proveedores locales de 
aborto, como los centros Bread & 
Roses y All Women's Health Cen -
ter.
D'Addario aseguró a los asis -
tentes que la prohibición del aborto 
no se basa en información médica 
precisa.
“Lo único que esto hace es 
poner a las mujeres embarazadas 
en un cronograma realmente es -
tricto sobre cuándo pueden tomar 
estas decisiones y cuándo pueden 
comenzar a acceder a la atención 
médica”, dijeron. “Para mucha 
gente eso ya es difícil, para las co -
munidades de color, para las comu -
nidades LGBTQIA+… esas comun -
idades ya están recibiendo atención 
médica discriminatoria”.
Nilufer Akalin, profesora de in -
vestigación del Centro de Género, 
Sexualidades y Estudios de la Mu -
jer de la UF, dijo que en las últimas décadas el aborto legal y seguro se 
volvió más accesible para las mu -
jeres en todo el mundo. Sin em -
bargo, en los EE. UU., parece que 
los marcos legales limitan cada vez 
más el acceso al aborto.
Esta prohibición al aborto tam -
bién podría conducir al cierre de 
clínicas, lo que aumenta la distancia 
de viaje para abortar, dijo Akalin. 
Aquellos sin capacidad financiera 
o acceso a transporte para viajar 
tendrían aun más dificultades para 
acceder a servicios de aborto.
“Después de todo este trabajo y 
también un movimiento feminista 
que liberalizó el acceso al aborto”, 
dijo Akalin. “Lo que estamos vien -
do en los EE. UU. es una dirección 
inversa”.
Texas, Arizona y Virginia imple -
mentaron prohibiciones de aborto 
de seis semanas y Mississippi tiene 
una prohibición actual de quince 
semanas.
“Hemos visto que histórica -
mente estas leyes no dan como re -sultado menos abortos… obligan a 
una mujer a arriesgar su vida y su 
salud al buscar servicios de aborto 
inseguros”, dijo.
La Organización Mundial de la 
Salud dice que la falta de acceso a 
servicios de aborto seguros y opor -
tunos es un problema crítico de 
salud pública y de derechos huma -
nos. Cada año, del 4,7% al 13,2% 
de las muertes maternas se deben a 
abortos inseguros.
El sitio de la OMS enumera los 
riesgos para la salud del aborto in -
seguro: hemorragia, infección, per -
foración uterina y daños en el trac -
to genital y los órganos internos.
Tener un hijo es un evento que 
cambia la vida, dijo el Dr. Akalin. 
Las personas deberían poder deci -
dir si están listas para este cambio.

Todd Golden has always held the 
Florida basketball program in high 
regard. When UF athletic director 
Scott Stricklin called the 36-year-old 
coach, he knew he had to pick up the 
phone. 
After Mike White’s departure 
March 13, Stricklin wasted no time 
bringing in the hottest name on the 
coaching market. Golden was hired 
March 18, and formally introduced 
Wednesday. 
“We spoke to an overwhelming 
number of people in and around the 
sport of basketball,” Stricklin said. 
“Whether it was someone in the NBA 
or someone in college basketball, 
Todd's name kept coming up.”
Golden’s rise to prominence in 
basketball circles didn’t happen 
overnight and his connection to 
analytics began early in his life. 
As a young kid, Golden would sit 
at his kitchen table eating breakfast 
with his father, Scott.
While Golden fueled up for a day 
at school, his dad would read the 
newspaper. After scouring the sports 
section, he would pass the paper to 
his son.
“I would go through and look 
at box scores and fell in love with 
looking at numbers,” Golden said.
The obsession with statistics 
followed Golden to high school and 
then his time as a walk-on point 
guard at Saint Mary’s College.
When playing for the Gaels from 2004-08, his coaches Randy Bennett 
and Kyle Smith calculated around 
40 different statistics during games 
and practices, using them as learning 
opportunities for their players.
“I saw what it did for me and 
the opportunities that it provided 
me,” Golden said. “It would be silly 
if I didn't take advantage of that as 
a coach.”
The coaching style worked, as 
Saint Mary’s landed two NCAA 
Tournament berths during Golden’s 
time in Moraga, California. 
Advancing past his college days, 
Golden traveled overseas to play 
professionally in Israel. He spent 
two seasons with Maccabi Haifa of 
the Israeli Basketball Premier League 
from 2008-10. Golden then traveled 
back to the United States and began 
working in corporate marketing and 
sales. 
His first job was at IMG College, 
and his second at Comcast SportsNet 
Bay Area. The years Golden spent 
putting his business administration 
degree to use revealed a desire to 
reconnect with the sport he loves. 
“I didn't want to come to work in 
a suit and tie every day,” Golden said. 
“It gave me kind of the jolt I needed 
to get back into basketball and into 
coaching.”
Two-year stints at Columbia and 
Auburn got Golden in the mix. He 
followed the same trajectory with 
both programs, getting in the door 
as a director of basketball operations 
and then moving up to an assistant 
coach role. At Colombia, Golden worked 
under one of his former Saint Mary’s 
coaches, Smith, who landed the 
head gig with the Lions in 2010. The 
connection would prove fruitful for 
Golden again in 2016, but he took a 
dive into the SEC first. 
Golden joined Bruce Pearl’s staff at 
Auburn in 2014. During his time with 
the Tigers, he would begin to rely 
on his analytical mind more. Golden 
headed up Auburn’s metrics data 
breakdowns and spent time getting 
accustomed to the conference’s 
landscape. 
“Really those two years made me 
very comfortable in the process with 
Scott,” Golden said. “Talking about 
what we could do [at Florida] and 
different things we could take from 
the first couple of years building 
[Auburn] up and what we could 
transition here”
After departing from Auburn, 
Golden would reunite with Smith 
yet another time, jumping to the 
University of San Francisco as 
associate head coach from 2016-19. 
The job would eventually give Golden 
full control of the Dons in 2019. 
It took time for USF to break into 
the national scene, despite a 22-win 
season in Golden’s first year. 
Playing in one of the premier 
mid-major leagues, the West Coast 
Conference and among the likes 
of powerhouse Gonzaga was no 
easy task. Yet, the Dons would find 
success and snap a 24-year NCAA 
Tournament drought this past 
season. San Francisco won 24 games 
and earned a No. 10-seed in the Big 
Dance, ultimately getting bounced by 
No. 7-seed Murray State in the first 
round. 
The year was Golden’s best and 
put him on the Gators’ radar. 
While at Florida, he aims to bring the program back to its old 
prominence. Expectations can never 
be too high, Golden said. 
The source of those very 
expectations is legendary head 
coach Billy Donovan, who spent 19 
seasons at UF with a 467-185 record 
and brought the school two national 
championships. 
Golden understands just how 
impressive the feat of back-to-back 
titles is. He was playing at Saint 
Mary’s during Florida’s best seasons 
under Donovan and followed those 
teams closely. 
“I was able to talk to Coach 
Donovan last Saturday for about 30 
minutes, and it gave me goosebumps 
the whole time we were chatting,” 
Golden said. “I want to pick his brain. 
I want him to be a big resource for 
me. He is a guy I look up to both from 
a coaching standpoint and also as a 
man.”
On Wednesday, Golden 
hammered two points home: he is 
confident in his ability to lead, and he 
wants to be at UF.
Golden wants to hit the ground 
running and bring together a deep 
roster for next season. The Gators 
will see seven seniors depart and just 
recently lost a commitment from five-
star forward Malik Reneau. Golden 
aims to build a group of talented 
players by any means, working the 
transfer portal and establishing a 
strong recruiting base. 
When forming his staff and initial 
team, Golden will target individuals 
that admire their opportunities. 
“I expect my student athletes as 
well as my staff to have an attitude of 
appreciation,” Golden said. “I won't 
take anything less than guys being 
super grateful for being a part of it.”
Building bonds with his players 
that extend beyond something transactional is essential for Golden’s 
coaching style. He wants to know his 
players personally and wants them 
to take pride in playing for him and 
their school. Golden built this respect 
with his players at San Francisco and 
hopes to replicate it at UF. 
“Making sure you know who their 
girlfriends are, what their social lives 
are like, what kind of music they like 
to listen to,” Golden said.”When you 
build those types of relationships, 
that's when you get guys to play hard 
for you.” 
Golden finished his opening 
address with a promise on behalf 
of himself and his future teams, 
encompassing the outlook of his 
tenure. 
“We'll have a lot of pride wearing 
the orange and blue, and I can say 
from the bottom of my heart that I'm 
incredibly proud to be a Gator.”

Florida men’s swim and dive 
team put an exclamation point on 
its season with a podium finish at 
the NCAA Championships. 
The Gators accumulated 
374 points during the four-day 
meet at the McAuley Center in 
Atlanta, Georgia, to earn the 
bronze, finishing behind the 
California Golden Bears and Texas 
Longhorns. 
It is the second-consecutive 
bronze finish at the NCAAs for the 
Gators, who have not placed higher 
than third since 1985 (silver) and 
1984 (gold). 
“It feels really good to get top-
8 and top-4 in the nation knowing 
there are 50 states and a lot of 
people in this country who dive,” 
junior diver Leonardo Garcia 
said. “That motivates me to keep 
working hard.” 
Florida made its mark by 
garnering three event national 
titles and an impressive 42 All-
American honors. The orange and 
blue led off the meet with its first-
ever national championship in the 
200-yard medley relay. 
Seniors Will Davis, Dillion Hillis, 
junior Eric Friese and sophomore 
Adam Chaney combined for a 
one-minute, 21.13-second swim. Chaney completed the first 50 
yards with a 20.19 backstroke 
and Hillis followed with a 23.20 
backstroke. 
Friese and Davis carried the 
final two legs with a 19.36 butterfly 
and 18.38 freestyle respectively. 
The Gators demonstrated their 
prowess during the first day of 
competition with an All-American 
seventh-place finish in the 800-
yard free relay. The team of 
senior Kieran Smith, juniors Trey 
Freeman, Alfonso Mestre and 
freshman Oskar Lindholm showed 
out to clock in at 6:09.01.
Florida continued its winning 
in the 200-yard free relay, securing 
its first national championship in 
the event since 2018. The quartet 
of Chaney, Friese, Smith and Davis 
shattered the school record with a 
1:14.11 time, besting the previous 
mark by 0.29 seconds. 
Smith was one of four Gators 
to receive All-American accolades 
in the 500-yard freestyle to wrap 
up Thursday’s events. Florida 
remained just 21 points behind 
front-runner Texas heading into 
day three. 
Florida racked up eight All-
American honors and two top-3 
finishes to conclude Friday.
Chaney earned the bronze 
in the 100-yard backstroke, 
completing the race in 44.35 seconds and eclipsing a UF 
benchmark previously set by 
himself. The Mason, Ohio, native 
aided in another record-breaking 
relay performance to wrap up 
Friday’s action, complementing 
Hillis, Friese and Smith yet again 
with a third-place finish in the 400-
yard medley relay (3:01.00). 
Other top performers Friday 
included senior Bobby Finke and 
junior Kevin Vargas (400-yard 
individual medley) as well as 
Freeman (200-yard freestyle). 
Gators diving made its presence 
felt through Garcia’s eighth-place 
effort on the 3-meter springboard. 
The Cali, Colombia, native tallied 
397.70 points. Garcia continued his 
success during Saturday’s finale 
with a fourth-place, 406.05 point 
performance on the platform dive.
“I have been doing these dives 
for over a year and half now,” 
Garcia said. “The more you do 
them, the more confident you feel. 
I really want to keep working hard 
so I can get more consistent and 
have even better results.”
Junior Anton Svirskyi earned 
the first Honorable Mention All-
American accolade of his career, 
placing seventh in the platform 
Consolation Final. The Ukrainian 
chipped in two points to the 
Gators’ team total. 
Despite being unable to hang on to a second place finish, Florida 
closed the meet with a bang thanks 
to Finke’s second-straight national 
championship in the 1,650-yard 
freestyle. The Clearwater, Florida, 
native broke a pool record and 
showed incredible endurance by 
touching the wall in 14:22.28.
Florida’s senior class certainly 
rose to the occasion, as Davis, 
Finke, Hillis and Smith ended up 
with a combined 17 All-American 
honors.
This is the end of the line for 
a Florida squad that captured 
its 10th-consecutive SEC Championship last month and will 
retain a plethora of young, talented 
swimmers to keep the Gators 
among the top aquatic teams in the 
nation.
“I think you can be very 
talented, but if you don’t put 
enough work into it, I don’t think 
you are going to achieve,” Garcia 
said. “I am a strong believer in 
hard work, and it pays off. I am 
very excited [about the future of 
the program].”
