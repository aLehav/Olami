82/55Underwear invention protects wearers’ privacy at airport
DENVER (AP) — It’s a special kind of 
underwear — with a strategically placed 
fig leaf design — and a Colorado man says it’ll get you through the airport screeners with your dignity intact.
Jeff Buske says his invention uses a 
powdered metal that protects people’s pri-vacy when undergoing medical or security screenings.
Buske of Las Vegas, Nev.-Rocky Flats 
Gear says the underwear’s inserts are thin and conform to the body’s contours, mak-ing it difficult to hide anything beneath them. The mix of tungsten and other met-als do not set off metal detectors.
The men’s design has the fig leaf, while 
the one for women comes in the shape of clasped hands.
It’s unclear whether it would lead to 
an automatic, more intrusive pat down by federal Transportation Security Adminis-tration officials.

� THE GATORS GAINED A 
SEASON-HIGH 547 YARDS SATURDAY.

Florida took the first step in 
salvaging its disappointing sea-
son against Appalachian State on Saturday in the The Swamp. 
The Gators (7-4, 4-4 Southeast-
ern Conference) broke a three-game home losing streak with a 48-10 win on Senior Day and gained some momentum head-
ing into their final regular sea-
son game with Florida State this weekend and whatever bowl game awaits.
“We needed a game like this 
for many reasons,” said senior safety Ahmad Black, who recov-ered a fumble against the Moun-
taineers. “One: to send the seniors 
out on a great note. And two: to try to get us back up. We suffered a tough loss last week. today was a great day for the Gators.”
It would have been easy for a 
still-reeling UF team to pack it in after that embarrassing defeat to South Carolina, which ended any hopes of an SEC championship 
and a BCS Bowl game appear -
ance. 
But the Gators regrouped, al-
beit against an FCS opponent, to-talling 547 yards of total offense, 
311 coming on the ground, and racing out to a 21-0 first-quarter lead. 
“Disintegration of a senior 
class is what wrecks a team, and this team is not wrecked,” UF coach Urban Meyer said. “We’re not really good in some areas. 
But it’s certainly not a play-hard 
issue, an attitude issue or any-thing like that.”
The senior class showed the 
togetherness Meyer talked about 
when an unfamiliar face crossed 
the goal line for the final score of the game in the fourth quarter. 
Already up 42-10, Meyer sent SWAMP SENDOFF

OBITUARY
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Staff Writer  
For all of his devotion to the law, philoso-
phy and, specifically , jurisprudence, Robert 
Charles Lincoln Moffat’s eyes would light up  
most when he talked about music.
Moffat, 73, passed away Nov . 14 after a 
two-year battle with cancer. He had served 
as a UF law professor for more than 40 years, 
specializing in jurisprudence, or the science or 
philosophy of law.
Robert Jerry, dean of UF Levin College of 
Law, said his fondest memory of Moffat is 
from a night in April, when Jerry hosted his annual music night for faculty and students of 
the college.
It was Moffat’s first year attending the party, 
which is hosted to give colleagues and friends 
a chance to get together and play some music.Moffat brought his brother, and together 
they sang a duet of “I’ll Fly Away ,” a traditional 
gospel song.
Jerry recalls being taken aback with Mof-
fat’s talent and passion for music.
“I didn’t realize he sang or played piano,” 
he said. “It’s a memory of Bob I’ll never for -
get.”
Dennis Calfee, a professor at the college and 
colleague of Moffat’s, said he always took time to listen and discuss ideas with colleagues.
“My memory of him is always of a person with a twinkle in his eye,” Calfee said.
He also remembered his colleague’s knack 
for stimulating minds.
“He was always ready to challenge you 
with his ideas and push you a little,” he said.
Jerry said students in his classes were ex-
tremely fond of him, and they appreciated the 
efforts he made, even in his final weeks, to go to class and teach.
“Professor Moffat cared deeply about his 
students, and took a great deal of personal sat-
isfaction in their achievements,” Jerry wrote in 
a statement released Tuesday.
Moffat had been a member of the Ameri-
can Section of the International Association for 
Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy since 
1966. He served as executive director from 1987 
to 1999 and as president from 2003 to 2005.
He is survived by his son, Iain, and daugh-
ter, Kaaren.Colleagues remember professor

� HE IS CONFIDENT THE 
DREAM ACT WILL PASS.
By ESTEE BECK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Speaking at UF on Friday night, 
Sen. Bill Nelson advocated for bi-
partisanship and spoke about the importance of communication, 
while simultaneously criticizing 
President Obama’s White House. 
“There is change a-comin’,” the 
Democratic senator said, refer -
ring to the change of power in the House, which Republicans over -
took in this year’s election. 
Nelson expressed his disap-
pointment with the election, say-ing that the process is becoming very narrow-minded. 
“What we are seeing is an in-
tolerance of ideas — an intoler -
ance of attitudes,” he said.  “If you get down to the nitty-gritty of this election, you see there’s a lot 
of angst in America.”
Florida voters elected Marco 
Rubio, a conservative Republican, 
to serve with Nelson in the Sen-ate. 
He said, among other reasons, 
voters are frustrated because of the housing crisis, which has hit Florida harder than most states. He said many plans have been created to fix the economy, but few are working. 
He also attacked the White 
House, saying the president’s staff was only giving a lackluster at-
tempt to execute Obama’s plans. 
He specifically addressed the 
recent Gulf oil spill, and suggest-
ed that military-trained officials, who are familiar with executing operations on a minute-by-min-
ute basis, should be in charge of 
disasters, not politicians and cor -
porations.
UF President Bernie Machen 
introduced Nelson, who was speaking for the Ernest R. Bartley Memorial Lecture series. The sen-ator, who attended UF but gradu-ated from Yale University, was a student of the professor, whom the series is named after, in the 1960s. 
In an interview after the speech, 
Nelson addressed issues he may be voting on soon. 
The senator is a co-sponsor of the DREAM Act, which would create a path to citizenship for children of undocumented immi-grants who graduate college or serve in the military.
Nelson said that congress will 
try to pass the DREAM Act after Thanksgiving, and he’s confident that it will succeed. 
However, the senator, who is 
a member of the Armed Services Committee, said he is less con-fident Congress will end “Don’t ask, don’t tell,” the military policy 
that bans gay and lesbian soldiers 
from serving openly. 
“I’m not optimistic that it will 
pass,” he said, referring to an up-coming repeal attempt.  
Nelson also said he was con-
cerned Congress would ban ear -
mark spending, which is funding targeted for specific projects. He said the state could lose funding 
for Everglades restoration, which 
amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal gov-ernment.

Kaitlynn Floyd has covered both sides 
of the note card in small print. She only 
gets one, so she has to make it count. It’s 
hard to steady her hands with her heart pumping like a piston. 
She fills the 3-by-5 inch rectangle with 
six minutes of main ideas, sources and 
quotes. 
For Floyd, 19, a sophomore public rela-
tions major, speaking in front of crowds is 
not new. In high school, she participated 
for three years in a speakers competition 
and, as senior class president, delivered a handful of speeches. 
But she still gets nervous.At 6 p.m. Wednesday, Floyd joins her 
Introduction to Public Speaking class-mates. This week’s topic: How do you get over an irrational fear? 
It is David Beckman’s job to provide an 
answer. Beckman is a 28-year-old adjunct instructor who spends a large chunk of his week teaching 75 students the art of public speaking. 
As an undergrad at UF, he starred on 
the debate team. But Beckman under -
stands that almost all of his students are third- and fourth-year medical majors ful-filling a graduation requirement, and most 
of them would rather perform an appen-
dectomy blindfolded than get in front of a crowd and speak.
He knows how his students show fear. Fear, Beckman says, appears in body 
gestures. Students interlock their hands, as if folded under a baby or in prayer. Some stand cross-legged. Others shuffle away from the audience, an unconscious retreat.
Getting over the fear is a matter of 
repetition, Beckman says. “The more you 
speak, the more you realize nothing bad is 
ever going to happen to you.”
For some, public speaking is a common 
fear, but everyone brings something to the lectern. A girl who sits in the front of the classroom asks a lot of questions, which makes some people mad because they 
want to leave as soon as possible. Some 
students act like they don’t care when they get up to speak, which makes Beckman mad because he can see lengthy prepara-
tion in their outlines.
Beckman himself used to speak in a 
flat, wooden tone. He sounded robotic, 
apathetic. But the job market is competi-tive, he says. Graduating students must be dynamic.
Floyd doesn’t worry much about dyna-
mism. If it’s an important speech, she just wants to make it to the podium without throwing up. 
As she lets the class know “How to Get 
Published,” she shifts her weight from leg to leg. Her hands sweep wide arcs. The pitch of her voice travels up, then down, never quite finding middle ground, yet 
sweet and pleasant. She begins most sen-
tences with “so” — as in, “So the next thing you are going to want to do…”
She hates when she trips over words 
because it makes her lose focus. She must 
concentrate on speaking and thinking of 
what to say next, simultaneously. The first half of her speech is marked by a shortness of breath. 
As Floyd settles into the material, her 
voice steadies. Time is an ally. Her ges-
tures become purposeful, her smiles genu-ine. She’s going to make it through. At the end, she breathes a faint “thanks.” 
After Floyd, a few more students plow 
through “How to Make Brownies” and 
“How to Make Trifle” before returning to 
their seats and collapsing.
Beckman is pleased — he sees improve-
ment. Each Wednesday night is a step for -
ward — university-mandated, but a step 
nonetheless — toward a lifetime of class participation and job interviews, board 
meetings, conventions, client calls and pa-tient consultations, wedding toasts, bap-tisms and eulogies.
They have the tools, his young orators; 
They’re working on the confidence. They 
can deliver a masterpiece with only a few 
days notice.
Beckman stands to announce next 
week’s assignment: impromptu speeches. 
Random topics. No preparation. Just pure, extemporaneous talking. 
Once again, Floyd’s heart begins to ac-
celerate.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2010

THE RELEASE OF THE NEW ‘ASSASSIN’S CREED’ AND ‘NEED FOR SPEED’ GAMES.

Students celebrated the re-
lease of new video games with 
a night of tournaments Friday. 
About 160 people came to 
celebrate the releases of the 
games “Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood,” “Dungeon De-
fenders” and “Need for Speed: 
Hot Pursuit” in the Reitz Grand Ballroom. 
Participants played the new 
games as well as classics like “Super Smash Bros. Melee.” 
Sponsors, including EA 
Sports and Ubisoft, brought about eight TVs to show off 
their games, and some students 
brought their laptops to play computer games like “Starcraft II.”
“It’s entertainment value first 
and foremost,” said Kyle Kir -
wan, president of Gator Gam-ing, a UF video game club.
He said the event also al-
lowed students to connect with other gamers and talk with em-ployers.
Adrian Hayes-Santos, asso-
ciate producer for Gainesville-based gaming company Trendy Entertainment, said he has more than 10 interns from UF.
He said gaming companies, 
especially local ones, often send representatives to show stu-
dents that they can make a ca-
reer out of a hobby.
“Gaming is still a growing 
industry,” he said.
Nathan Dolorfino, treasurer 
of Gator Gaming, said video games have the potential to tell stories in a way that combines art, psychology and entertain-
ment.
“It is a place where I feel I can 
put my full passion,” he said.Students turn out for

The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment caught five students skip-
ping class during the first truancy detail of the school year Thurs-day.
Three GPD officers and several 
Alachua County school resource officers canvassed Gainesville, hitting popular school-skipping spots like The Oaks Mall, But-ler Plaza and neighborhoods in northeast Gainesville.
From 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., of-
ficers found five students skip-
ping school, said GPD Lt. Jaret Weiland. 
He said four of them were 
taken to the truancy center at the 
Interface Youth Program, 1400 NW 29th Road.
When students are taken to 
the center, they are processed into a system, and schools are no-tified of their absence, according to Weiland.
One high school-aged student 
was arrested during the detail for violating his parole — which re-quired him to attend school, Wei-land said.
The student’s probation also 
requires him to obey a curfew and listen to his parents.Truancy detail nabs

� THE EVENT WAS PART OF THE 
TRANSGENDER DAY OF REMEMBRANCE.
By CORAL DENTON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Greg was a son and a brother. He 
played football for East Carolina Univer -
sity. He was a husband and the father of 
two children. 
After living as a man for 50 years, 
Greg became Gina Duncan. 
Duncan addressed a crowd Friday 
during the Transgender Day of Remem-brance Candlelight Vigil organized by the UF Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans-gender Affairs on the Plaza of the Ameri-
cas. 
Duncan described the emotional times 
she once endured and the realization that 
she had gender identity issues. She said she became increasingly depressed and 
withdrawn from her family. 
“The grayness of discontent grew 
stronger with each passing day,” Duncan 
said.
For Duncan, the identity issues she ex-
perienced were not a choice.
“Who would destroy their near per -
fect life on purpose?” Duncan said.
In the conclusion of her speech, Dun-
can called on the audience to strive to be authentic in their lives.“One day I hope being transgender 
has no more significance than being left- or right-handed,” she said. 
The lighting of candles occurred as 
the names of those murdered for violat-ing gender norms were read. 
Elizabeth Spiwak, a UF senior, said 
she was impacted by the reading of the names and death descriptions because 
she is not personally aware of anyone 
with transgender questions.
“Hearing how they died made me 
want to cry,” Spiwak said. 
Donnie Fields, UF Pride Student 
Union president, said the purpose of the vigil was to raise awareness of violence against transgender people and to re-member those who have lost their lives.
“Regardless of how much we talk 
about progress in our community and how far we’ve come, there’s still a lot 
to do for those who are marginalized,” 
Fields said. Vigil honors transgenders

After nine years of funneling travelers into ever 
longer lines with orders to have shoes off, sippy cups 
empty and laptops out for inspection, the most sur -
prising thing about increasingly heated frustration with the federal Transportation Security Adminis-
tration may be that it took so long to boil over.
Even Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
who is not subjected to security pat-downs when 
she travels, understands the public’s irritation. She, for one, wouldn’t want to go through such scru-tiny.
“Not if I could avoid it. No. I mean, who would?” 
Clinton told CBS’ “Face the Nation” in an interview broadcast Sunday.
President Barack Obama says he has pushed the 
TSA  to make sure that it is always reviewing screen-ing processes with actual people in mind. “You have to constantly refine and measure whether what we’re doing is the only way to assure the American people’s safety,” Obama said Saturday. “And you also have to think through, are there ways of doing it that are less intrusive.”
On CNN’s “State of the Union,” TSA chief John 
Pistole insisted that the current threat level is too high to lessen the use of full body scans and inti-
mate pat-downs. “No, we’re not changing the policies,” he said.
Hours later, however, Pistole is-
sued a statement saying the agency 
would work to make screening methods “as mini-mally invasive as possible.” He gave no indication 
that screening changes were imminent but said that 
“there is a continual process of refinement and ad-justment to ensure that best practices are applied.”TSA to tone down pat-downs

EDITORPaul RunnestrandStefania FerroMANAGING EDITORSJared MisnerOPINIONS EDITORLame-duck season should be revamped
Lets be real, when you get fired from a job you’ve 
had for at least two years, are you really in a cheerful mood? 
Do you want to go and do what’s in the best interest of 
your company despite the knowledge that you have noth-
ing left to lose? 
Yeah, somehow I don’t see that happening. In fact, it’s 
far more likely your emotions will get the best of you, and 
you’ll do whatever you feel like doing.
 Fortunately for most employers, when they fire an em-
ployee, that person will be spending the next day packing up his or her belongings and will never have a chance to do harm to his or her now ex-employer. 
The basic idea is one that seems like common sense to 
me. 
But, of course, when we’re talking about the govern-
ment, do we really expect anything to make sense any-more?
Instead, we allow members of Congress to continue 
to make important decisions for the country after many 
of them have already been kicked out of office. 
The people have spoken, and they do not think those 
individuals are fit to properly represent them anymor — which begs the question: Why are they still in Wash-ington, D.C., representing those same people who just 
fired them?
I might be a little more sympathetic if our officials 
were using this time for productive measures such as 
overturning the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. 
But no. 
Instead, they’re passing laws that, quite frankly, are 
not time-sensitive and should wait till the new Congress 
comes in to pass or fail.
The big issue here is the members of Congress cur -rently in office are no longer ac-countable to anyone. These mem-bers don’t have to follow the will 
of the people because the people 
have already willed them into un-employment. 
So, naturally, legislators can 
just do whatever they want and pass bills they know the American 
people do not support. 
Using political turmoil to pass legislation that 
couldn’t be passed any other time is reprehensible by 
any means.  
It’s such a simple problem to fix that it pulls at the 
Constitutional question as to why we still have this idi-
otic time period. 
Members of Congress take sizeable vacations 
throughout the entire year — is it really necessary to have one of the few times they are working be after a large portion of their colleagues have just received their pink slip? 
Congress can still be on standby in case of emergen-
cy, which oddly enough seems to be the only time the dominant political parties seem to agree, but it doesn’t need to be making country-changing decisions during 
any lame-duck anything. 
Why hasn’t this teensy constitutional rift been mend-
ed?
I guess I’ve just always thought when you fire an em-
ployee, he or she is supposed to leave.
Silly me.

Pope’s ruling 
problematic, ineffective 
Never fear, Gators. If any of you were musing on your 
sexual morality and overall human decency and/or worth while contemplating a trip to confessional af-
ter your purchase of a box of Trojans, don’t you worry. 
For the first time in the history of Catholicism, sticking it 
to Jesus and the Man Upstairs, Pope Benedict XVI said con-dom use can, in fact, be justified in some cases. 
But only if you’re making people pay you to have sex.Pope Benny, the same guy dealing with one huge Catholic 
sex scandal after the next, said he’s still sticking to centuries of Church doctrine by not overriding Jesus’ apparent abhor -
rence of birth control the Catholic Church has said is “not a real or moral solution,” but rather the Vatican is effectively telling male prostitutes to wrap it up. 
With its statement that’s sure to put a few nuns’ habits in 
a tizzy, the Vatican is still trying to recover from Benedict’s recent verbal blunder when, en route to AIDS-decimated Af-rica, the current pope said condoms did not help prevent the spread of HIV . 
We can already hear you groaning. With its admission of the acceptable use of condoms by 
male prostitutes, the Catholic Church has, perhaps, succeed -
ed in distancing itself even further from the general popu-
lace. 
We realize the Vatican and the holiest of all holy people 
detest any form of birth control for the possible rejection of 
the formation of one of God’s children, but the teachings of abstinence-only sex education only serves as an enormous detriment. 
And to say we were surprised to see the pope say condom 
use was acceptable for male prostitutes but not the average citizen would be a bit of an understatement. 
Rather than taking the opportunity to reaffirm the rejec-
tion of prostitution and acknowledge the dangers of HIV by recommending a more modern approach to sexual protec-tion, the pope would rather encourage his children to con-tinue to have unprotected sex.
The Editorial Board might not be the most holy of enti-
ties, but at least one of us would consider ourselves down with the G-O-D. But what we can all safely agree on is the anachronistic teachings of the Vatican and their irrelevance 
in the modern day. 
By continuing to discourage the use of condoms, much to 
the dismay of international public health officials, the pope 
has effectively encouraged the spread of sexual diseases and the continuing worldly evil of overpopulation. 
As we said, we might not be the biggest winner in Jeop-
ardy’s “The Bible” category, but we can’t imagine why an all-loving pope would want to see his flock exposed to debilitat-ing diseases and decreased economic conditions at the hands 
of an already-established overpopulation crisis.
Yes, we realize sex without the intent to procreate is one of 
those sin things, but so is eating shrimp or wearing a sweater 
made of wool and cotton. 
Yes, we realize the biblical intention of sex is to have a 
child, but the Vatican should effectively examine its policies and their effects. 
What’s the greater of two evils — a loving, commit-
ted couple having protected sex or an (obviously married) 
couple having unprotected sex and producing another un-
wanted child in the economically dilapidated Bangladesh that’s already facing greater economic and social strains at the hands of overpopulation, thereby exposing one of God’s children to a life of tribulations and hardships? 
It’s time to educate your flock, Benny. Male prostitutes 
aren’t the only ones who should be using condoms.

Letters to the Editor
Meatless Monday furthers UF’s sustain -
ability
In his Thursday column, Nate Rushing tru-
ly misrepresented UF’s new Meatless Monday 
campaign. 
First, he grazes over a very important logis-
tical detail — Meatless Monday only applies 
to UF’s two dining halls and was designed this 
way to continue to allow freedom of choice. If students would like to choose to eat meat  on Monday, they can visit Subway or Panda Ex-press for any of their meat-filled main entrees, as UF’s installment of the Asian fast-food res-taurant does not offer a vegetarian main en-trée. And if a student is feeling daring, he or she has the freedom of choice to grab a slice 
of pizza at Papa John’s topped with, I believe, 
five varieties of flesh. 
In regard to the personal freedoms that 
have allegedly been so unjustly taken, Meat-less Monday allows the population of vegetar -
ian and vegan Gators a better variety and does not stop omnivores from making the decision to try any number of the other food locations 
on campus if they simply cannot stomach their 
spaghetti without some meatballs. 
Rushing could stand to do some fact check-
ing of some of his other statements. Slaughter -
houses, where the majority of American meat animals are producted, feed their animals corn, not grass, and they keep them in small spaces so tiny they often cannot move around so the animals build fat faster. A truly healthy cow is fed exclusively on grass. The hamburger on most dinner plates or within fast-food wrap-pers was likely not fed much grass at all. 
According to the Worldwatch Institute, 
animal agriculture accounts for more than half of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. 
Much of this comes from transportation alone. 
UF’s Meatless Monday campaign is meant to be part of UF’s dedication to sustainabil-ity. Clearly, a reduction in meat consumption aligns with those goals.

Facebook e-mail accounts won’t make 
much change
The fact that Facebook is revamping its 
messaging system is no cause for alarm or up-
roar.
First of all, the concern that it’ll put a nail 
in the coffin of traditional e-mail services like 
Gmail and Yahoo is a bit superfluous. Imag-
ine e-mailing a future employer about a job inquiry from your Facebook account. He or she then clicks on your profile and sees your whole online life, the good, the bad and the ugly . Should you have to censor everything you or someone else posts on Facebook be-cause you are now giving unwanted guests an invitation to view it? No. For this reason 
people will continue to use those traditional e-mail services. It’s less intrusive and generally 
looks more professional than a Facebook ac-count e-mail address.
The resolve for concerns over privacy on-
line is basic: Don’t put things on your page that you don’t want the world knowing. Peo-ple have been warned about this, but still they insist on updating their statuses every two seconds with information the world shouldn’t know. 
Some people voice irrational concerns just 
to stir a discussion about technology taking over our lives. Why can’t we sit through a 
50-minute class or meal with our friends with-
out checking our phones? I think this is the more important issue at hand.

No one will be safer without Four Loko
I come from a family where everyone for 
several generations has graduated college, and most of my immediate family own busi-nesses. What I’ve noticed most since becoming a student at the university is that I have a very 
uncommon perspective. 
When I first saw Four Loko, I knew like 
many it was a regrettable night in an alumi-
num can. But I know there is significant effort in putting a product to market. 
Despite Four Loko consisting solely of sub-stances that our heavily lobbied government has approved individually for consumption by adults, the FDA has decided the mixture is dangerous. The issue with these drinks was brought about largely , if not entirely , from the behavior of underage drinkers.
Despite the fact individuals do things that 
are illegal, this is obviously the product’s fault. This rationale would put the auto industry out of business for a 14-year-old driver causing an accident. 
While the idea of Four Loko is not the most 
novel, every company is someone’s baby. Nobody works as hard for as little as a small business owner. The decision of the FDA to 
regulate a drink designed for people of legal 
drinking age due to the actions of underage drinkers is an exercise that has restricted our personal freedom of choice. 
But what’s worst of all is this action will 
do nothing to make anyone safer. People can get exactly the same effect as Four Loko from about four cups of coffee and a few glasses of wine. Mixing alcohol and caffeine isn’t rocket 
science. The only people hurt by this decision 
are those who made the effort to please the consumers. The FDA, by meddling in the af-fairs of bottlers, has done nothing other than eliminate jobs in a year where double-digit un-employment is a major issue. Great job, Uncle Sam.

People shouldn’t be protesting against immigration re-
form for illegal aliens. They should be protesting against the immigration laws and system as a whole. For a coun-
try founded on immigration, America has some of the most complex, unforgiving, expensive and xenophobic immigra-
tion laws of any developed country . The entire system is in 
dire need of major reform.
Illegal immigration is an attractive option when you con-
sider how hard it is to move here legally. Legal immigration involves ridiculously long wait times, stacks of complicated paperwork, a lot of money and an equally large amount of red tape. I had to go through the process myself and it took 10 painfully slow, frustrating months and several thousand dol-lars to receive my visa. I was stuck in London apart from my 
fiance the entire time. I compulsively checked my e-mail to 
see if I’d received notification of my case finally moving on to the next processing center. Immigration cases can be postponed for up to a year, and not knowing just how long I would have to wait was the worst aspect of the 
process.
I visited America on a tourist visa to surprise my fiance on 
his birthday during those 10 months apart. I was almost tempt-ed to give up on the legal route and just disappear somewhere into rural America with my fiance and become an illegal alien. However, I knew as an illegal immigrant, I wouldn’t be able to work or travel out of the U.S. without trouble, so I flew back to England with an indefinite wait looming ahead of me. After several more agonizing months, I received the visa. I then had to pay a small forutune for vaccinations, a full medical exam 
including HIV testing and background checks. When I was 
finally reunited with my fiance in Florida, I had to wait five months for my work permit to come in the mail, and I watched my savings dwindle away . And there are thousands of others going through the same ordeal, waiting apart from their fam-ily and loved ones for the overburdened case workers at im-migration to finally get to their file and approve them.
A comprehensive reform should include a program for 
migrant workers and their families to earn legal permanent residency and eventual citizenship, a new worker visa pro-gram that protects the rights of American and foreign work-ers, and a reform of the family-based immigration system and restoring due process protections for immigrants. The system needs to be revamped with less complex paperwork and more caseworkers. When legal immigration isn’t such an onerous prospect, perhaps illegal immigration wont be such a tempt-
ing alternative.

Salsa Caliente
A couple salsa dances in front of a live band on the Reitz Union front lawn Friday night during 
the Puerto Rican Week Closing Ceremony. The event was put on by the UF Union de Estudi -
antes Puertorriquenos Activos.
�MORE THAN 80 DONATED.
By TYLER COLE 
Alligator Contributing Writer
While waiting in line to see “Har -
ry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: 
Part 1,” moviegoers also helped save lives.
“Our goal was to get at least 100 
recipients to give blood throughout the week,” said Clay Gibbons, the district community development coordinator for LifeSouth. “Films like this bring a younger crowd, and with time to burn while waiting in line, why shouldn’t they donate?”
At the film’s opening Thursday 
night, Gibbons said LifeSouth re-
ceived 38 donors in six hours, and 
48 more donated Friday.
Regal Butler Plaza Cinemas, 
3101 SW 35th Blvd., first invited LifeSouth to park its bus outside the theater in 2008 when the “Twilight” film series began, Gibbons said.  The vampire film drew 78 donors on the opening night. 
Gibbons said if the organization 
had had more buses, it would have collected more blood — 20 potential donors were turned away because there wasn’t enough room.
Themed donation events bring 
groups of people and motivates first-time donors to participate, Gib-bons said. 
“When people come together, 
the experience is a lot more enjoy-able and the time goes by quicker,” he said. “You also sometimes have to give incentives, but it’s worth it.”
This year, LifeSouth handed out 
free Harry Potter T-shirts to do-nors.
Meg Harris, a 21-year-old ap-
plied physiology and kinesiology major, said she arrived early to pick up her ticket for a later showing Saturday and figured she would participate. It was her sixth time do-
nating.
“I like giving blood, and it’s 
great for them to set up outside of 
the theater,” Harris said.  “The free shirt was pretty cool, too.”
Tracey Catron, a donor who 
gave blood Saturday , said she gives every two months.
“I work with people who ob-
tain bad injuries as an insurance 
adjuster, so I realize the importance of giv-ing blood anyway ,” Catron said. “Every-
one loves Harry Potter, so it makes sense to promote a good cause where people are.”
Gibbons said there were at least 
2,000 people waiting for the pre-miere of the movie Thursday night.
LifeSouth plans on continuing 
its relationship with Regal Cinemas, and Gibbons said the next film they are planning on parking at is the midnight premiere of “Tron: Lega-cy” on Dec. 17.
“We need events like this to 
maintain the community’s blood supply, and hopefully future dates will produce as many donors as the past,” he said.‘Harry Potter’ blood

After successfully playing a 
complete 40 minutes on Thursday, 
the Gators were afflicted by an old problem. 
No. 9 Florida (3-1) entered 
halftime with a 17-point lead. But when the final buzzer sounded, it had escaped with just a six-point win against Morehead State on Sunday in the O’Connell Center. 
“We just stopped executing,” 
senior Vernon Macklin said. “We came out a little flat and they went 
on a run.”Morehead State started the sec-
ond half on a 22-11 spurt, which 
was fueled largely by senior Ken-neth Faried. 
Faried, the Eagles’ lone forward 
in a four-guard lineup, finished with 20 points and 18 rebounds.
“Faried is unbelievable, he’s 
a warrior,” said senior Chandler Parsons, who had a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds. “We could really learn a lot from that guy — how hard he goes to the glass and how he takes a look 
at the game.”
After the Gators held the Eagles 
to just 29 percent shooting in the 
first half, they allowed Morehead  State to shoot 44 percent in the fi-nal 20 minutes. 
That charge was led mostly by 
Faried, who scored 14 second-half points on 7-of-8 shooting. 
Faried’s 14 second-half re-
bounds also gave life to an Eagles team that looked overmatched in the first half, when the Gators out-
rebounded them 23-15. 
“Faried was just the key to their 
team,” sophomore Kenny Boynton 
said. “He was a big part of their energy. …When he started getting his rebounds in the second half, I think overall as a team, that just started picking them up.”
Some of Faried’s success can 
be attributed to the limitations on Vernon Macklin and Alex Tyus, who had each missed significant practice time with injuries leading up to Sunday’s game. 
Although some may be dis-
appointed that the Gators were outrebounded 41-36 by a team from the Ohio Valley Conference, 
Faried’s status as the nation’s sec-
ond-leading rebounder last season should be a mitigating factor. 
“He just totally destroyed our 
front court,” coach Billy Donovan said. “That was an incredible per -
formance by just a terrific player.
“He’s a Dennis Rodman-type 
guy.”
Another component that 
seemed to wilt down the stretch was Florida’s press, which was a disruptive force and caused seven turnovers in the first half. 
As the game wore on, More-
head State took a page out of the Ohio State playbook, using a few of the Buckeyes’ strategies to han-dle the pressure with ease. 
“In the first half we could run up 
and jump and trap them,” Boynton said. “But in the second half they started bringing men back and they just let one guy bring it down, 
so we had no choice but to just stay 
in front and keep four guys back.”
Florida’s defensive struggles 
were in some ways fueled by a lack of energy, which was a result of poor shooting. 
After opening the season with 
three consecutive games of at least 49 percent shooting, the Gators 
shot just 39 percent against the 
Eagles. 
“In the second half our inability 
to put the ball in the basket had 
a direct effect on our emotional level and the way we played in the second half in terms of battling through the adversity and the dif-ficulties we had offensively,” Don-ovan said.

Gators win despite second-half woes
� THE GATORS CLINCHED THEIR 19TH SEC TITLE 
FRIDAY.
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
 
It was not the easiest of victories.After Florida clinched sole possession of the Southeast-
ern Conference title with a win against Arkansas on Friday, 
UF took down yet another ranked opponent after defeating No. 16 LSU 3-1 (25-19, 33-31, 25-27, 25-13) in Baton Rouge, La., on Sun-day.
The No. 1 Gators (26-1, 19-0 SEC) made 
the Tigers (24-4, 15-4) their 10th ranked 
victim this season. UF is 10-1 in ranked 
matches, with its only misstep coming against then-No.1 
Penn State on Sept. 10.
“This was great volleyball today as both teams battled, 
especially in sets two and three,” coach Mary Wise said. “It was such a high level of play. I thought the key to the No. 1 UF takes 
down No. 16 LSU  
This blowout win was ex-
actly what the Gators needed.
After three consecutive losses 
at home and a crushing defeat that ruined any hopes of a third straight appearance in the SEC 
Championship, Florida was on 
the ropes.
Would the coaches lose this 
team? Would the players just pack it in with nothing to really 
play for?
We got our answer Saturday 
when UF beat Appalachian State 
in convincing fashion. But that’s 
about all there is to take from 
that game.
No, the Gators have not fig-
ured out their offensive woes. No, they do not belong in the top 
25. And no, UF is not back.
The Gators beat an FCS school 
at home by 38 points. They did 
what they were supposed to do. 
I know fans want to jump on any sign of success and treat it like 
some sort 
of epipha-ny, but this team just 
isn’t going 
to have one of those m o m e n t s 
this year.
You should have learned 
your lesson after back-to-back wins against Georgia and Van-derbilt. Most believed that Flor -
ida had figured it out after those two victories over “quality” op-ponents. But they were quickly proven wrong when South Car -
olina took UF’s cookies and ate 
them too. 
The Gators have a lot of im-
perfections that can only be Florida’s wins against weak 
opponents mean nothing

SEE ANTHONY, PAGE 16SEE VOLLEYBALL, PAGE 14VolleyballFaried dominated UF down lowin defensive tackle Gary Beemer, who is a walk-on redshirt 
senior,  on 1st-and-goal from the 4-yard line. 
Beemer took three handoffs from Jordan Reed, who scored 
three rushing touchdowns and threw another to starting quar -
terback John Brantley. On the third try Beemer punched in the first touchdown of his career — college or otherwise — as his teammates celebrated with him on the field and sideline. 
“My last touchdown was never ago,” Beemer said. “The 
chance if I was a starter here to score a touchdown, as a defen-sive lineman, is astronomical in itself. For them to just come up to me with seven minutes left in the fourth quarter and say, ‘Hey, would you like the ball on the goal line?’ I’m still 
trying to process it and make it a reality.”
It was a classy moment for a senior class that also showed 
what can bubble over during a frustrating season. 
Redshirt senior wide receiver Carl Moore was kicked out of 
the game along with ASU defensive back Ed Gainey following offsetting personal foul penalties for fighting. UF is waiting to 
hear from the SEC league office as to whether Moore will face a suspension against FSU as well. 
For a group of players just looking to go out on a high note, 
missing a starter against the Seminoles would be an unneeded 
obstacle.
“We’re playing for pride right now,” senior center Mike 
Pouncey said.14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2010

Florida’s offensive line dominated 
Saturday, and no one benefited more 
than Rainey. The junior carried the 
ball on three of the Gators’ first five plays, gaining 40 yards and capping 
the opening drive with a 16-yard 
touchdown. With his speed and 
undersized frame, its clear Rainey needs good blocking to thrive. But if he gets it, Rainey can post big numbers effortlessly.

UF senior Callie Rivers (5) earned a career-best 23 points behind her 21 
kills, seven digs and four blocks Sunday.
Rivers notched career-high 21 kills
match was that we were toe-to-toe with LSU, 
which leads the league in digs, and really made a statement with our blocking.”
The Gators just narrowly lost the dig battle, 
finishing with 71 digs compared to the Tigers’ 72. Florida easily won the blocking battle, how-
ever. The Gators recorded 11 blocks as a team while LSU only got four.
Florida has counted on its blocking game all 
season long. This match marked the 14th time 
this season the Gators have recorded double-digit blocks. It was also the fifth time in the past 
six games — a good sign for a team with just one 
regular season match left before the postseason.
Florida also counted on the play of senior 
outside hitter Callie Rivers. 
Rivers recorded a career-high 21 kills on a 
.410 hitting percentage. Her seven digs, four blocks and one assist gave her a match-high 23 points — also a career best.
“Callie earned every one of those kills,” Wise 
said. “She had great vision tonight and took such smart swings.”
Rivers had just five attacks errors on 39 total 
attacks.
“To have 21 kills against such a good team 
as LSU is a great job of really getting it done,” Wise said.
Senior libero Erin Fleming also recorded per -sonal bests, finishing with a career-high 22 digs. She also managed to dish out four assists.  
Continuing to play well were middle block-
ers Lauren Bledsoe and Cassandra Anderson. 
Bledsoe hit .381 and recorded 10 kills, a dig 
and five blocks. Anderson pitched in with 10 kills as well, hitting .364 with an assist, three digs and six blocks.
The Gators hit .298 as a team and held LSU to 
an inferior .157.
This was the second time the Gators knocked 
off the Tigers this season. Florida won 3-1 (25-16, 
20-25, 25-22, 25-18) in Gainesville on Oct. 1.VOLLEYBALL , from page 13

“My last touchdown was never ago.The chance 
if I was a starter here to score a touchdown, as 
a defensive lineman, is astronomical in itself. 
For them to just come up to me with seven 
minutes left in the fourth quarter and say, ‘Hey, 
would you like the ball on the goal line?’ I’m still 
trying to process it and make it a reality.”

If Jordan Reed has gotten this 
far without a full grasp of Florida’s playbook, imagine what he could do if he ever picked up the offense.
Reed accounted for four touch-
downs in the Gators’ 48-10 win 
against Appalachian State, throwing 
one and rushing for three from the 
quarterback position.
UF coach Urban Meyer has said 
Reed still hasn’t mastered the of-
fense enough to run it full time, but 
he’s producing solid numbers in his 
limited role. Reed ran for 71 yards 
on 11 carries and completed 2 of 3 
passes for 14 yards.
“He’s getting close, isn’t he?” 
Meyer said.
Reed has thrown a touchdown in 
each of the last three games — the only contests where he’s attempted a 
pass. Meanwhile, starter John Brant-
ley has thrown for just two scores in 
the last seven games.
Brantley was 16 of 22 for 222 
yards and an interception Saturday. 
He also scored on a 5-yard touch-
down catch, when he lined up at receiver and was left open by the de-
fense until Reed hit him on the right 
side of the end zone.
“He’s doing a really good job,” 
Brantley said of Reed. “I’m really 
happy for him. He can run the ball 
really well and he can throw because 
he has a great arm. He’s picking it up. He’s taking more and more reps 
in practice to get him ready for that 
kind of stuff.”
But the playbook doesn’t seem 
to be expanding for Reed. He was 
expected to serve as a wildcat quar -
terback before preseason hamstring 
and knee injuries derailed the plan, 
and since taking a more active role, he said he’s still studying the same packages of plays in addition to his 
duties as a tight end.
 “I still don’t know if he’ll stay 
at quarterback (long term),” Meyer said. “I still don’t know what’s best 
for our team.”
Next season, the Gators expect to 
add highly touted prep quarterback Jeff Driskel — a UF verbal commit — to the mix. The Oviedo Hagerty 
High star accounted for five touch-
downs (two passing, two rushing, 
one receiving) and 494 yards of total offense in a loss to Lakeland High on 
Friday . 
Happy send-off for seniors: Sat-
urday was the final home game for 23 seniors, and they were honored in a ceremony before kickoff. Center 
Mike Pouncey was the only senior 
who ran out of the tunnel with his 
helmet on when his name was an-nounced.
“I didn’t want to show everyone 
I was crying,” Pouncey said. “It was 
an emotional day . I gave my life to 
this program, and it paid off today by getting the win out there.”
Pouncey said he and safety Ah-
mad Black, who he’s played with 
since high school, got choked up 
while looking back on their careers 
before the game, and perhaps no 
one has come as far as Black.
Meyer stated that fact Saturday , 
saying Black had made as big a leap 
in four years as any player he has 
coached, and he called him the na-
tion’s best strong safety . Black leads 
UF in tackles, recovered a fumble 
against the Mountaineers and en-
tered Saturday first among active 
Southeastern Conference players 
with 11 career interceptions.
“As a freshman, I got told to go 
get Gatorades for the whole posi-tion group, and trying to get a rep 
in practice was like pulling teeth,” 
Black said. “To go from where I was to where I’m at now is just a tremen-
dous opportunity.”
Etc.: Cornerback Jeremy Brown 
(hamstring) and receiver Andre De-
bose (ankle) didn’t dress out. … Cor -
nerback Janoris Jenkins and defen-
sive lineman Earl Okine both left the 
game with concussions, but Meyer 
said he expects Jenkins to be fine. …

UF freshman Jordan Reed has finished with a touchdown pass in each of the last three games. He ran 
for 71 yards and completed two passes Saturday.
cured some major changes like 
a new offensive coordinator and quarterback. No big deal.
UF’s seven wins have come against Miami (Ohio), South Flor -
ida, Tennessee, Kentucky, Geor -
gia, Vanderbilt and Appalachian State. That isn’t exactly a murder -
er’s row. The Gators have gone up against three ranked opponents 
this season — Alabama, LSU and South Carolina — and lost to ev-
ery one of them.
These victories temporarily 
cover up Florida’s blemishes and keep fans somewhat happy, but they don’t mean much when they 
come against inferior opponents. There is no meaning behind the 
wins when this is the case.
Until UF beats a team it isn’t 
supposed to, each result must be taken with a grain of salt. 
This is why the Gators won’t 
take down the Seminoles on the road. FSU is ranked and is not a team UF should beat. 
And if Florida has shown one 
thing this season, it is their inabil-ity to surprise people. So just be ready to expect the expected — 
mediocrity.

Heading into today’s national cham-
pionship race, Genevieve LaCaze knows 
the Gators will have to lean on more than 
a strong performance from their top-three 
runners to capture their first NCAA title.
For the last two critical meets of the sea-
son, No. 29 Florida has relied on high fresh-men finishes to fill out its last two scoring spots. And in Terre Haute, Ind., this after -
noon that trend seems unlikely to change.
Behind the resurgent trifecta of LaCaze, 
Charlotte Browning and Rebecca Lowe, the 
Gators captured a Southeastern Conference 
crown and a second-place finish in the South Regionals. But right on the upperclassmen’s heels in each race, the freshmen duo of Cory McGee and Stephanie Strasser secured top-35 results and valuable points for the team.
“I think that going into it we know that 
we have a lot of support around us, espe-cially those girls on the end of our scoring 
group,” LaCaze said. “There are so many 
of them surrounding that fifth spot that they are a little bit nervous but confident as well.”In a race that features 412 competitors 
crammed onto a 6K course, the environment can be unwelcoming for runners experienc-ing a national meet for the first time.
“It is tough for these girls being freshmen 
because they have to step up and fill in that fourth or fifth spot,” LaCaze said. “But no one has consistently been labeled the fifth runner, and I think that they can all work for that spot together.”
The Gators have also been working to 
get Lowe, a redshirt junior, back into fitness for just her third race of the season, as-
sistant coach Todd Morgan 
said. Since returning from a hamstring injury , Lowe has yet to reach her All-Amer -
ican form from a year ago 
despite two straight top-three team finishes.
In the men’s 10K race, junior Dumisane 
Hlaselo will be running as an individual competitor after Florida failed to qualify for 
nationals as a team. Hlaselo won an at-large 
bid after finishing in the top-five in both the SEC Championship and South Regional races.UF set to run for national titleUF SWIMMING

This weekend the Gators treaded in 
the waters of the 1996 Olympics, rising to 
place in the top five of the Georgia Tech Invitational’s 13 competing teams. The men’s team finished in second while the 
women secured the third-place spot. 
The three-day meet in Atlanta’s Geor -
gia Tech Aquatic Center paved the way 
for freshman and U.S. National Team member Elizabeth Beisel to earn UF’s first automatic qualifying time for the NCAA Championships this season. 
Beisel touched in at second place 
in the 400-yard individual medley at 
4:06.84, this season’s second-fastest time 
in the country . 
“It was a little bit of a surprise,” Beisel 
said. “I wasn’t too confident I’d be able to go that time at this point in the season, so it was a really nice surprise and relief.”
The women’s team was also celebrat-
ing U.S. National Team member and ju-nior Teresa Crippen’s return to the pool. 
Crippen has been out of competition 
since mid-October due to the tragic pass-ing of her brother and U.S. swimmer Fran Crippen.
Upon Crippen’s return to the pool Fri-day, she finished in fifth place in the 200-yard individual medley and assisted her 
relay team’s No. 3-spot in the 400-yard 
medley relay event. 
Crippen’s time in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley was a personal season best.
“It’s amazing she’s back. She’s incred-
ibly strong,” Beisel said. “We’re all really glad she’s back because she is one of our 
best swimmers.” 
Dwyer dominates 
for men: The men’s squad also reeled in successes as senior Conor Dwyer rounded out in the top spot in the 400-yard individu-al medley finals with a 
time of 3:45.21, nearly 
seven seconds faster than the previous nation-leading time for the event this sea-son.  
Dwyer also dominated the 200-yard 
individual medley, finishing at 1:45.52, the nation’s leading time for the event.  
“With how hard we have been train-
ing I wasn’t sure how fast I was going to be at this meet,” Dwyer said. “I enjoyed 
swimming the (individual medleys) be-
cause it’s something different than the normal freestyle lineup.”Beisel qualifies for NCAAs
