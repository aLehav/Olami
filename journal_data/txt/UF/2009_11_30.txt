Blood ban raises brows
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
Danny Chaviano is a relatively normal
guy.He loves pasta. He plays piano. He pays
taxes.
He's your neighbor, your classmate, your
average civil engineering student. He speaks
of his calculus class with an air of slight dis-
gust, and he thinks one of the weirdest things
about himself is his utter dislike of steak.
But the Food and Drug Administration
thinks this 18-year-old, piano-playing, pasta-
eating, UF engineering student is a potential
threat to blood banks everywhere.
Chaviano is just one of the sexually active,
gay American men who have been turned
away from donating blood since 1983 when, in
the light of the AIDS scare, the FDA enacted an
umbrella ban on any man who has had sexual
contact with another man since 1977.
"I couldn't do something for someone justbecause of my sexuality," Chaviano said. "It
just doesn't make sense."
And he's not the only one who doesn't un-
"I couldn't do something for some-
one just because of my sexuality. It
just doesn't make sense."

derstand or agree with the 26-year-old ban.
Jeremy Whitaker, now a 19-year-old UF
student, was the vice president of his high
school's semiannual blood drive when he was
turned away from donating blood.
Although he helped sponsor the event
that accrued about 60 quarts of blood, he was
deemed ineligible for the same reason Chavia-
no was: He is a sexually active gay man.

Even Florida State fans wanted a piece
of Tim Tebow.
Florida's quarterback took his final vic-
tory lap around The Swamp following his
team's 37-10 win against the Seminoles,
moving at a slow pace to soak it all in.
There were plenty of high-fives, pats on
the back, thank-yous and well-wishes, in-
cluding some from those clad in Garnet
and Gold.
One member of the FSU band looked
genuinely saddened when Tebow skipped
her section, as he chose to offer an emphat-
ic Gator Chomp instead.

some Florida State fans stuck around to
wish Tebow goodbye.
No one will be happier to see him go
than them.
With Tebow as a starter, Florida has
topped Florida State by a combined score
of 127-37, the most dominant three-year
run in the rivalry's history.
In front of a record crowd
of 90,907, Tebow threw for
221 yards and three touch-Football downs on 17-of-21 passing
and added 90 yards and
two more scores on the ground. In three
years against FSU, he has accounted for 14
touchdowns.
"That was one of his best performanc-
es," UF coach Urban Meyer said. "I've nev-

ON CAMPUS
SG to discuss SNAP changes
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Students hope they won't be
left saying "Oh SNAP!" after
Thursday's meeting between
Student Government members
and the University Police De-
partment.
SG and Inter-Residence Hall
Association representatives
will meet with Capt. Jeff Hol-
comb and officer Pablo De Jesus
Jr. to address student concerns
with the Student Nighttime
Auxiliary Patrol, or SNAP, the
free campus transportation ser-
vice.
Unite Party Sen. Sever-
in Walstad, who represents
Springs Residential Complex,
said SNAP was designed in
1976 to provide a safe ride
home to students walking alone
at night. Since then, groups of
students take advantage of the
service and use it as convenient
way to get around campus.
Walstad said he hopes stu-
dents realize SNAP's main fo-
cus is safety rather than conve-
nience.
However, he does not wantto discourage students from
riding SNAP.
Walstad said some ideas
that could be discussed at the
meeting include a SNAP 1
service, intended specifically
for students traveling through
"Individuals seeking a
ride should take priority
as they are less safe than
a group of students."
Severin Walstad
Unite Party Senator
campus on their own.
a Individuals seeking a ride
should take priority as they
are less safe than a group of
students," Walstad wrote in an
e-mail.
Orange and Blue Party Sen.
Jonathan Ossip said another
improvement is creating set
routes for the vans.
He said some of his con-
stituents complain about be-
ing awakened by the late-night
honks of SNAP vans outside
their residence halls. Ossip
said the vans would not need
to honk if they had predeter-mined routes.
Ossip said he is glad SG will
address concerns with SNAP
because SG has not been proac-
tive about correcting problems
with this service in the past
and sometimes relies on the
prodding of the administration
before it takes action.
Former Progress Party Sen.
Dave Schneider said members
of his party will suggest post-
ing signs at SNAP pick-up lo-
cations similar to RTS signs,
so students would not be con-
fused about where to meet
SNAP vans.
Any changes made to SNAP
would come in the wake of re-
forms instigated by Student
Body President Jordan Johnson
at the start of the Summer B
term.
Johnson said the number of
SNAP vans was doubled from
two to four, the hours were ex-
tended to 3 a.m. and the num-
ber of drivers was increased.
"But this service allows us to
reach out to every kind of stu-
dent that is out there and offer
them a service that everyone
can appreciate," Johnson said.RUB to host double

Students looking for ways
to procrastinate during the last
days of the semester should stop
by the Reitz Union Auditorium.
Reitz Union Board Enter-
tainment and FreedomZone, an
alternative marketing and me-
dia company based in Salt Lake
City, are hosting the Starbucks
Doubleshot Film Fest tonight
and Dec. 8.
Featured films include "In-
glourious Basterds," which will
be showing tonight, and "The
Invention of Lying," which will
be played on Tuesday.
Both movies will be played
at 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Doors
will open 30 minutes before each
showing.
In addition to the movie, Star-bucks is providing unlimited
Doubleshot energy and coffee
drinks for the audience, accord-
ing to RUB film chairwoman
Abby Swartz.
Swartz said they expect a
large turnout tonight and next
week.
"Typically with our bigger

fill up," Swartz said.
Members of the audience will

cards and gift bags with DVDs,
snacks and other goodies.
Swartz said UF is one of 10

by Starbucks and FreedomZone
to put on the promotional event.
According to Swartz, the
roughly $300 Starbucks and
FreedomZone paid to host the
event will go into the RUB bud-
get for film festivals and movie

ROLLER DERBY
Rebels win final match
Rayiaz Khan / Alligator Staff
Gainesville Roller Rebels players jostle for position with a Tallahassee Rollergirls player
during the Throwdown in Titletown roller derby at Skate Station Sunday night.By GAIA BONINI
Alligator Contributing Writer
They're on wheels, and they could knock
you out.
They're the Gainesville Roller Rebels, a
local roller derby league that finished the
season Sunday with a 104-90 win over the
Tallahassee Rollergirls.
About 300 fans watched at Gainesville's
Skate Station Funworks as the Roller Reb-
els brought in their fourth win of 12 bouts
played this season.
In roller derby, which started in the 1930s
as an endurance sport, players assume al-
ter egos with names like Patsy Clothesline,
Grizzly Madams or Meow Mix Yo' Face
Up, which are meant to intimidate.
Each team of five players is made up of
four blockers and one jammer.
Each of the two 30-minute halves of the
game are divided into jams, or periods of
play that can last up to two minutes, or un-
til the jammer in the lead declares it over.
Points are scored when a jammer passes
the opposing teams blockers.
But it's not as easy as it sounds.
Those blockers will do nearly anything
to keep that from happening, including
shoving, tripping and "booty blocking"girls, sending them tumbling off the floor
and often into the crowd.
The blocker's job is to help her jammer
pass the opposing team's blockers but at
the same time block the other team's jam-
mer from passing through.
"It's like rugby on wheels," said jammer
Kerri Duffield, better known as Suzie Bone-
breaker.
Duffield graduated from UF in August
2009 with a degree in architecture and has
been a Roller Rebel since February 2008.
She and the nearly 50 other girls on the
team practice about 10 hours a week.
"It's truly one of a kind, and I think that's
why it's so fun, besides the knocking girls
over part," Duffield said after the game.
Throwing elbows and pushing, howev-
er, will land a player in the "sin bin," or the
penalty box.
Sunday the Roller Rebels played to sup-
port the Spread the Love charity, which
raises money to fight cervical cancer.
The women are trying to help one of
their own, a Tallahassee Rollergirl named
Stephanie, or Danger S, who was diagnosed
with stage 4 cervical cancer on Oct. 28.
The Roller Rebels held a raffle during
halftime that raised about $1,100 for the
charity.
UF student fights hunger with beard
* HE RAISED MORE THAN $700
FOR A NONPROFIT THAT FIGHTS
CHILDREN'S HUNGER.
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
Jesse Lash can't remember the last
time he bought shaving cream.
Tuesday will be the first time he's
picked up a razor in nearly two months,
and he'll be the first to admit that his
new look is as scary as it is hairy.
"I look like a hideous caveman,"
said the UF marketing junior. "People
probably just assume I don't shower or
bathe -I do."
But it's a sacrifice he's willing to
make.
Lash is in the final stretch of his not-
so-clean-cut days after participating in
Octobeard and No Shave November,
monthlong events that challenge par-ticipants to drop the razor and go au
naturale.
"I haven't shaved since Sept. 30,"
Lash said. "I'm literally counting the
days."
Although No Shave November par-
ticipants often compete in the month-
long challenge for fun, Lash's shaving
hiatus was for a cause he
Local handpicked back in Octo-
News ber.
As of Sunday, he has
raised $732.42 for Not-
Fashionable, a South Florida-based
nonprofit organization dedicated to
fighting hunger and starvation in chil-
dren.
Lash set up a PayPal account to col-
lect donations and linked it to the Fa-
cebook event page he created.
"In the end, the focus is not me
competing," he said. "I'm trying to
raise money for this great cause, and
it's been unbelievable."Lash said 30,000 children die from
hunger every day.
His donation will help NotFashion-
able plant a farm for a community in
Swaziland that doesn't have a sustain-
able food source.
Including his contribution, Lash
said the organization was able to raise
the $8,000 needed for this endeavor.
And for Lash, this is why he has
sworn off shaving for the past two
months.
"I think that I have helped connect
people to a cause," he said. "I'm just a
kid who isn't shaving. The focus is re-
ally on the people who have sacrificed
and chosen to give."
Lash, who originally intended to
only participate until he raised $100, is
encouraging others to "man up."
"Sure, you're going to look a little
homeless," he said. "But you're going
to be saving the lives of so many kids
that are less fortunate."Ana Goni-Lessan / Alligator Staff

Bad Blood
FDA should not restrict
gay men from donating
If you've justbeen in a horrible car accident and you're bleed-
ing to death on a surgeon's table, would you refuse a blood
transfusion from a gay man?
Some might. This is largely because of a stigma surrounding
the prevalence of IIV in the gay community, especially among
gay men. In light of this concern, the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration has enacted guidelines that ban sexually active gay men
from donating blood.
But put it another way: Would you accept a transfusion from
a black person? How about from someone (anyone) living in
Washington, D.C.?
The number of refusals would surely drop, even though
these groups are at an increasing risk for HIV, a rate fast ap-
proaching that of the gay community.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, half of all di-
agnoses in 2007 came from the black community. A full 3 per-
cent of Washington, D.C., residents have HIV (4 percent among
black residents), according to an article in Time Magazine.
Middle-aged people in Washington suffer from HV at a rate
of 7 percent, and this is even higher in the middle-aged black
community.
Granted, these figures are less than the double-digit infec-
tion rates of gay men in some communities, but unfortunately,
they are quickly catching up.
So whynotban all blackpeople from givingblood -or, even
better, all middle-aged residents of Washington, D.C.? Because
that would be an absurd and politically disastrous choice.
Singling out the gay community is a much easier and politi-
cally palatable decision for the FDA to make. These guidelines
stem from the panic and rash actions that swept the nation in
the early 1980s, after AIDS was deemed a "gay disease," and
rates began to soar (among all populations).
But to single out any group, "high risk" or not, is unneces-
sary. All blood donations are tested for HIV, along with hepati-
tis and other viral and bacterial infections.
Thankfully, the FDA's ban is simply an added precaution.
So, you wonder, how can an added precaution possibly hurt
anyone?
Tens of thousands of people donate blood every day, a full
500,000 in the days immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks.
Because of these FDA regulations, all male blood donors must
indicate that they have not had sexual contact with another man
since 1977. All female donors must declare that they have not
had sex with a man who might have had sexual contact with
another man during the past 12 months. ("I hope not" was not
one of the answer choices.)
By exposing such a large number of people to questions like
this every day, the FDA is perpetuating the false notion that
AIDS is a gay disease. It clearly isn't. Heterosexual sex is the
fastest growing transmission method, and a lack of awareness
about this issue is blamed for the pandemic-level infection rates
in Washington, D.C.
The ban also adds to the chronic shortage of blood for the 4.5
million blood transfusions needed each year.
Ultimately, these regulations represent yet another facet of
life that is unequal for gay people. The guidelines may have
been enacted with the health of all Americans in mind, but the
fact that they were enacted in a time of panic and bigotry is un-
deniable.
If a ban like this were placed on virtually any other group,
there would be widespread anger and protest, but because of
the long-standing stigma -perpetuated by the ban itself -it
goes largely unchallenged.
We believe that it's time to stop perpetuating this false ste-
reotype and accept the gracious blood donations of any and all
healthy donors.
Lifesaving does not have a sexual preference.

Old Florida needs to let go of old ways
he Gulf of Mexico may look calm from the porch I'veperched myself on for the Thanksgiving holiday,
but a contentious political storm is slowly brewing
over efforts afoot in the Florida Legislature to repeal a ban
on offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
The question of whether to drill isn't as partisan as
some may think. Just as there are Democrats who support
repealing the ban, there are many Republicans who favor
keeping the ban in place.
One of those Republicans is Senate President Jeff Atwa-
ter, who has slowed legislative efforts aimed at repealing
the ban. Unfortunately for opponents of offshore drilling,
Sen. Atwater will only hold his post for one more year.
Supporters of offshore drilling will be happy to hear
that Atwater's slated replacement is another Republican,
Sen. Mike Haridopolos, who has publicly stated his desires
to open up the Gulf of Mexico for drilling exploration.
Haridopolos, who is also a faculty member at UF, isn't
advocating a minority viewpoint. Multiple opinion polls
have shown that as the state's economy worsens, many
Floridians have warmed up to the idea of allowing off-
shore oil and natural gas exploration.
Opponents of offshore drilling are quick to claim that
tourists would go elsewhere if beaches were ruined by an
oil spill, drawing the connection that offshore drilling is
bad for Florida tourism.
In the crazy and beautiful state that is Florida, the com-
plex issue of offshore drilling has been expressed by our
parents and those old enough to be our parents as a choice
between protecting Florida's $57 billion tourism industry
and the choice of creating more jobs by reducing the coun-
try's energy dependence on foreign oil.
This is so Old Florida thinking.My generation knows that the
future of Florida doesn't rest sole-
ly in either of these options. New
Florida is a Florida that promotes
new forms of energy, rather than
oil, whose heyday was many, many
Matthew Christ family vacations ago. New Floridaletters@alligator org is a Florida that doesn't put all of its
economic eggs in one basket prone
to hurricanes, and yes, possibly oil spills. New Florida is
a Florida that embraces and incentivizes alternative forms
of energy and invests in its future by devoting time to its
youth. (Note to legislators reaching for the budget scalpel:
Few high-tech companies are going to come here if our na-
tive workforce isn't more proficient in math and science.)
Unfortunately, few in the Old Florida camp have come
to the conclusions New Florida has already reached and
have instead launched a debate about the merits of drilling
offshore for a polluting natural resource on the decline.
This is not the debate we should be having. This is
certainly not discussion worthy for the proverbial dinner
table. Instead, Floridians should ask why their state was
ranked 23rd in energy efficiency by the nonprofit Ameri-
can Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. The greatest
irony of Florida's day is that the state that calls itself the
Sunshine State hasn't adequately invested in solar energy,
much less any other alternative energy.
Instead, Old Florida residents have worked themselves
into a tizzy over tourism and oil, as if their great state has
only these two options to offer its citizens.
How wrong they are.

UF needs textbook rental program
The typical undergraduate student at UFspends nearly $1,000 every two semesters
on textbooks. This is not earth-shattering
news if you are a student. It is no surprise that
textbooks are expensive, and these prices con-
tinue to soar. In fact, the Government Account-
ability Office estimates that over the past two
decades, college textbook prices have grown at
twice the rate of inflation. With recent legislation
to raise tuition and narrow the scope of Bright
Futures in Florida, university students and fami-
lies have an even greater burden to bear. It's
evident that the last thing students need is ex-
orbitantly priced textbooks. To help lower the
cost of textbook prices, I suggest we implement a
textbook rental program.
Textbook rental programs are not a new idea
and have garnered attention elsewhere. Univer-
sities all over the country have initiated textbook
rental programs to save their students money.
In North Carolina, Appalachian State Univer-
sity has offered a textbook rental program since
1938. Not only have these programs existed and
been met with success, but the federal govern-
ment has granted money specifically to fund
pilot textbook rental programs. The 2008 Higher
Education Opportunity Act included $10 mil-
lion in grants to support pilot programs, and ac-
cording to Charles Schmidt of the National As-
sociation of College Stores, more than 20 college
bookstores have already applied for grants. UF
is not on that list.
Starting a rental program at UF is crucial to
reducing the cost of textbooks for the students
here. Not only does this solution give students a
new and improved option, but it gives both pub-
lishers and textbook authors a way to continue to
profit from their books after the first sale, some-
thing that is lost in the sale of used textbooks.
This year, the University of North Florida and
Florida State University bookstores participated
in a pilot program for textbook rentals launched
by Follett Higher Education Group (the same
publishing company UF uses). So the question
remains: Why is UF not launching a pilot rental
program if the same publishing company man-
ages our bookstore? Well, this is the $65,000
question. There is no reason UF should be left
out.
Not only is funding provided, but positive
feedback from other colleges clearly demon-Kristin Klein
Speaking Outstrates that these programs
lower costs for students
dramatically. Many Florida
university bookstores ad-
vertised the ability to rent a textbook at about 55
percent less than the retail price. These reduced
costs, coupled with the federal government's al-
location of $10 million, clearly show the feasibil-
ity of these rental programs.
All readers should be informed that state and
federal legislation not only legally allow UF to
implement a textbook rental program, but also
encourages UF to do so. This is explicitly stated
in the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act,
and UF adopted regulation 8.003, which calls
upon the university to act to improve textbook
affordability.
If UF blithely accepts federal money for ef-
forts such as construction projects, then it should
have no problem accepting federal money for a
pilot textbook rental program. Many argue that
as UF students, we attend the "very best" uni-
versity in Florida and thus deserve the very best
services from our institution. Why should other
schools benefit from rental programs and not
UF? A change in UF textbook policy is overdue.
According to assistant director of UF Business
Services Division Jerry Merriwether, "Currently
there are no plans on setting up a rental textbook
program at UF." In a parallel fashion, Student
Government has suggested that UF would rath-
er "recycle textbooks" (i.e. sell your textbook at
one-sixth of the cost you bought it for). But this
solution is the same as selling and buying used
textbooks. We need a new solution.
Students need to act now. We need to let the
Board of Governors and UF Academic Affairs
know that we deserve equal opportunity to rea-
sonably priced textbooks. Publishing companies
should not over-profit off our necessity for text-
books in the classroom. Fundamental necessities
should never be taken advantage of. If we do not
act now, we are only hurting ourselves.
The $55 a student could save by renting a $100
calculus book rather than buying it is vital for a
student during tough economic times. If FSU can
enact such change, UF can too. We are currently
writing a Student Senate bill on this topic; we en-
courage you to join the many voices advocating
for a textbook rental program.
Kristin Klein is a UF political science junior.Christian, liberal values OK
Unlike Ashley Stringfield, I be-
lieve that being Christian means
believing in all progressive val-
ues, including being pro-choice
and embracing equal values for
all. I think it's a travesty to say
that there is something "inherent-
ly wrong" with being Christian
and supporting these values.
I am pro-choice because being
Christian means respecting other
points of view. Besides, the Bible
does not give a clear-cut position
on abortion because the proce-
dure was not common in those
days. A passage in Exodus even
states that the life of a child before
birth isn't worth as much as a full-
I fledged human being.
.I support gay marriage be-
cause I believe God loves all peo-
ple equally. To pick and choose
a Bible verse and condemn (as
well as deny a set of rights to) a
group of people based on sexual
orientation is discriminatory and
wrong. In 1967, the courts struck
down bans on interracial mar-
riage, which in public opinion
were labeled as illegal, immoral
and ungodly.
As far as I'm concerned, these
so-called moral values are only
going to hold temporary interest
until the right finds some other
Bible verse that they think will
justify another discriminatory, ir-
rational and hateful movement.
The views of these radical
conservatives don't represent the
lifestyles that many other moral
Christians choose to abide by,
and I am glad that statistics fi-
nally show that being both eco-
nomically and socially liberal is
gaining ground in the Christian
community.

Moms use kids to indoctrinate
I give a nod of agreement to
the Wednesday column, "Kids
Should Not be Billboards." I am
a student and full-time employee
who works at a business on Uni-
versity Avenue. While working, I
watch mothers pushing strollers
(complete with babies) along our
sidewalks, donning these "Islam
is of the devil" T-shirts. It disap-
points me that people feel more
comfortable hiding behind their
months-old children to spread a
discriminatory message. These
mothers are persistent, walking
with their babies in cold, rainy
weather. They approach passers-
by with pamphlets and smiles.
But why use the infants? Should
we be more inclined to trust theirmessage because they are respon-
sible for a tiny human?
The ongoing crusade brought
to our neighborhood by the Dove
World Outreach Center and its
group of utterly brainwashed
Islam-haters reminds me of Lamb
and Lynx Gaede. These girls
were commonly referred to as
the Olsen twins of the Nationalist
Movement. They starred in music
videos that praised not only Hit-
ler but also his accomplices and
denounced interracial procre-
ation. These children were quite
obviously repeating the verbiage
of their extremist Nationalist par-
ents. These are the instances of
free speech during which every
human rights supporter cringes.
We activists might rather ig-
nore that these people are exercis-
ing a basic right that we continue
to fight for as U.S. citizens.
To defend our right to the free-
dom of speech but then denounce
those who use it distastefully
seems hypocritical. Still, to allow
this kind of public discrimination
to persist is unethical.
But, as a famous quote reads,
"I may not agree with what you
say, but I will defend to the death
your right to say it."

Islam on Campus gives thanks
In the name of God, the most
beneficent, the most merciful.
May peace and blessings be
upon you.
Last Friday, the 10th day of
Dhul-Hijjah, 1429, or Nov. 27,
as you would normally call it,
Muslims around the world cel-
ebrated the Islamic holiday of Eid
al-Adha. This is a holiday of re-
membrance, commemorating the
prophet Ibrahim (Abraham, may
peace and blessings be upon him)
and the steadfastness he showed
toward the Almighty God. Eid
al-Adha falls on the third day of
the annual Muslim pilgrimage to
Makkah, known as the Hajj.
This year, 2.5 million Muslims
from around the globe made the
journey to take part in a tradi-
tion that dates back to the time
of the prophet Ibrahim in order
to strengthen their spiritual fibres
and connection with the Almighty
God. This is truly a time of wor-
ship, peace and thankfulness.
We at Islam on Campus would
like to extend these glide tidings to
all peoples on the UF campus and
those in the Gainesville commu-
nity. This community has shown
us much support, for which we
are ever thankful. We pray to
the Almighty God to guide us, to
protect us during these challeng-
ing economic times and to help
strengthen our bonds of kinship
and respect.
We hope that you all had a
pleasant Thanksgiving, and we
wish you the best of luck with
your upcoming exams.

FDA keeps ban due to 'imperfect testing' methods
BLOOD, from page 1
thing, and I couldn't even contribute," Whi-
taker said.
The ban, which also includes any woman
who has had sexual contact with a man who
might have had sexual contact with another
man during the past 12 months, was de-
signed two years after the first cases of AIDS
in five gay Los Angeles men were reported
to prevent the transfer of HIV or AIDS from
"high-risk communities" through blood
transfusions.
And as people recognize the 21st World
AIDS Day tomorrow, some blood bank of-
ficials are wondering why the FDA has not
changed the policy when, according to the
American Red Cross, someone in the United
States needs blood every two seconds.
"It's one of those policies that makes you
scratch your head," said Galen Unold, direc-
tor of recruitment and retention at LifeSouth
Community Blood Centers Inc. "But you
have to understand why the policy was put
in effect. At that time, this group was at the
highest risk."
The FDA insists the current policy that
"defers" any sexually active gay man from
donating blood is based on policies that as-
sure the protection of the nation's literal life-
line.
"Although this policy may disqualify
some healthy individuals from donating
blood, it has proven effective in protecting
the nation's blood supply," the FDA states
on its Web site.
And not everyone disagrees with the
FDA.
"I agree with this policy becausee HIV
or AIDS is high risk for that group, it has
nothing to do with discrimination," Melody
Sansbury, a former American Red Cross em-
ployee, wrote in an e-mail.
Jenni Schelble's mouth gaped open, ex-
posing the forkful of Hare Krishna lunch
she was eating under the looming shadow
of one of LifeSouth's bloodmobiles on Tur-
lington Plaza, when she found out the ban
was still in effect.
"It's blatant, horrible discrimination," she
said.
"By their logic, are they going to sayblack women can't donate blood? Can you
imagine if they started saying black women
couldn't donate blood?"
Schelble's comments allude to a 2007
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
study that found about half of new AIDS
diagnoses in the U.S. during that year were
from the black community.
Bobby Davis, HIV/AIDS program coor-
dinator for the Alachua County Health De-
partment, noted that although about half the
new diagnoses in 2007 came from the black
community, the black community is much
larger than the gay community. As a result,
the overall HIV/AIDS prevalence within the
U.S. black community is still lower than that
of the gay community.
After analyzing people by race, the CDC
found the black community accounted for
46 percent of those infected in the U.S. with
HIV or AIDS.
The CDC also found that men who have
sex with men account for 48 percent of those
infected with HIV or AIDS in the U.S., ac-
cording to the same 2006 study.
The numbers in Alachua County seem
to follow the same nationwide
Local trend.
News Since the ACHD began
keeping statistics in 1983, 56
percent of all reported AIDS infections have
been from the black community and 41 per-
cent of all reported AIDS transmissions have
been through male-to-male sexual contact,
according to a June 2009 report.
"It's really important to protect the na-
tion's blood supply," said James Beaudreau,
education and policy director for the Gay
and Lesbian Medical Association. "But we
think the policy needs to be re-examined."
Unold agreed with Beaudreau, as he
stressed the importance of a time-based de-
ferral system for men who have sex with
men similar to the current policy that allows
any person who has had sexual contact with
a prostitute more than 12 months ago to do-
nate blood.
"I would feel completely comfortable if
the FDA reversed that policy," Unold said.
"I think our blood supply would still be
safe."
The American Red Cross has been press-
ing the FDA to do just that.In a 2006 statement with America's Blood
Centers and the American Association of
Blood Banks, the American Red Cross stated
the current FDA-regulated lifetime defer-
ral for any man who has had sexual contact
with another man "is no longer medically
and scientifically warranted."
"We have always supported the use of
scientific and rational deferral programs,"
American Red Cross spokeswoman April
Phillips said. "Given the science we have
and given the sophistication we have, the
main thing right now is for the sexual defer-
ral policy to be applied equally to everyone
and not just certain communities."
Although blood banks across the country
test all donations for infections, the window
period for HIV or AIDS, the time after expo-
sure to the infection before it can be detected,
and "imperfect testing measures" continue
to be the main reasons the FDA has refused
to adjust its 1983 policy.
The GLMA addressed the issue in a 2008
statement to the FDA.
"[The window period] is not a meaning-
ful basis to establish policy either for the
population as a whole or for men who have
sex with men," the statement read.
The statement also requested the FDA
adopt "social behavior screening rules" to
modify the current lifetime deferral pro-
gram to allow men who have sex with men
at a lower risk of infection, including those
in monogamous HIV-negative relationships,
to donate blood.
Although Unold and Phillips both said
the current FDA policy should be reexam-
ined, the pair also addressed other ways a
person who is deemed ineligible to donate
blood can help with America's blood short-
age, including volunteering at a local blood
drive or recruiting donors.
"I understand the frustration, but don't
take it out on a community's blood supply
and the patients that it serves," Unold said.
"If you're going to boycott the policy, don't
boycott the Blood Mobile. Don't prevent
someone from donating blood. Don't pre-
vent someone from giving the gift of life."

AIDS should call 352-392-1161 ext. 4281 to

FSU has 10,148 votes, top-

"I want to take the band

But the UF sophomore said
it's not just about the rivalry.
He plans to switch his vote
to FSU if UF doesn't climb the

at 11:59 p.m.
"I hope we can at least keep

hoping we'll pull through."
Erdman said the voting pro-

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -
Like the hopeful high-rollers
lining the casinos near Board-
walk Hall, Florida entered the
weekend with nothing to lose
and an opportunity to gain
more than anyone thought
possible.
By the time the Gators left
the Jersey shore Saturday night,
they had picked up a cham-
pionship trophy and made a
convincing argument that they
are a better team than the pre-
season predictions claimed.
UF won the Legends Clas-
sic, stunning No. 2 Michigan
State 77-74 in the semifinals on
Friday night thanks to Erving
Walker's 3-pointer with 1:55
remaining, clutch free throws
by Walker and senior forward
Dan Werner and a last-second
defensive stand.
A night after the emotional
victory, Florida overcame a
lackluster start and avoided a
letdown with a dominant sec-
ond half en route to a 73-58
victory against Rutgers (3-2) in
the championship game.
"It's huge for us as a team,"
said Walker, who was named
the tournament's MVP. "We
knew that we could compete
with these teams, but to come
out and actually beat themits jackpot
shows us that we can play with
anybody in the country. We've
just got to keep it going."
Although it came in an
early season tournament and
long before the grind of the
Southeastern Conference
schedule, it's hard to overlook
the significance of what UF ac-
complished in Boardwalk Hall
over the weekend.
For the first time since the
2006-07 national championship
season, the Gators are 6-0, and
Florida had not beaten a team
ranked as highly as the Spar-
tans (5-1) since defeating No. 2
Kansas on Nov. 29, 2002.
"We knew that we could
compete with these
teams, but to come out
and actually beat them
shows us that we can
play with anybody in the
country. We've just got
to keep it going."
Erving Walker
UF sophomore point guard
Perhaps most importantly,
winning two nonconference
games against quality teams
on a neutral court provided an
opportunity for the Gators to

UF FOOTBALL
Gators experienced defense stifles 'Noles
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
Florida's dismantling of Florida State
in one of the nation's premier rivalry
games surprised a lot of people.
UF senior linebacker Ryan Stamper
wasn't one of them.
Stamper said the combination of the
Gators' experienced defense, the Semi-
noles inexperienced starting quarterback
EJ Manuel, who made his third career
start, and the experience of an emotional
Senior Day was the perfect storm for 37-
10 blowout.
"To be honest I did (expect to domi-
nate them)," Stamper said. "I'm not going
to lie and say I didn't."UF's defense was especially dominant
in the first half, allowing the Gators to
take a 24-0 lead into the locker room.
FSU had five possessions before the
break -four punts and an interception
-that netted the Semi-
noles 55 yards of total
offense and three first
downs.
As a result, UF con-
trolled the clock as
FSU's offense could only
Dunlap stay on the field for 10
minutes.
The Seminoles were unable to convert
a third down in the first half and finished
the game 2 for 11 on third-down conver-
sions.
FSU tacked on a touchdown late withUF's backups in the game, but the fact
that coach Bobby Bowden attempted
a field goal down 30-0 at the end of the
third quarter on fourth and goal from
the 2-yard line speaks volumes about the
dominance of the Gators defense.
"Being able to send your seniors out
right in their last game in The Swamp,
that's the best thing you can do for them,"
said junior defensive end Carlos Dunlap,
who had a sack and three tackles.
Stamper and junior outside linebacker
Brandon Hicks, who got the start for an
injured A.J. Jones, tied for the team lead
with seven tackles, and Hicks added two
sacks.
Defensive coordinator Charlie Strong
kept FSU off balance with blitzes on third

POLL QUESTION
Today's question: Which school has
been Florida's biggest rival in the
Urban Meyer era?Field goal
sinks rivalry
to new low
lorida State kicker Dustin
Hopkins trotted onto Florida
Field to attempt a 20-yard
field goal with the Seminoles down
30-0 at the end of the third quarter
and gave the 90,000-plus onlookers
a startling wakeup call.
This is what the UF-FSU rivalry
has come to.
The Gators have pummeled the
Seminoles in recent years, as Satur-
day's victory made it six in a row
for Florida. The fact that UF has
ripped off a few in a row isn't un-
usual for a rivalry, but the last three
scores -
* 4512, 45-
15, 3710
-could
certainly be
described
as unusual,
Kyle Maistri if not em-
Kyle Points barrassing.
kmaistri@alligator org The only
difference
between
Saturday's contest and UF's other
three nonconference games 
-
Charleston Southern, Troy and
FI -was FSU's ability to avoid
getting dominated by the second
team. The Gators' starters made
the Seminoles, who amassed 55
yards of offense in the first half,
look no different than the Golden
Panthers.
A sad statement for a once-great
rivalry.
Merriam-Webster's Dictionary
defines a "rival" as:
1. One of two or more striving
to reach or obtain something that
only one can possess.
2. One that equals another in
desired qualities.
The UF-FSU rivalry certainly
meets the first part of that defini-
tion, but in no way does it meet the
second condition.
Never has the inequality been
so evident as when Bobby Bowden
called a timeout -or Jimbo Fisher,
or whoever runs that team now
-on fourth and goal from inside
the 5-yard line only to send out his
kicker to break up the shutout.

UF holds FSU scoreless in first half
FOOTBALL, from page 1
ing to go try and find some guys like
that."
Meyer should also be hoping he gets
to see another defense like his current
one.
In the first half, Florida held FSU to
55 yards and zero points, forced four
punts and made an interception.
The unit played well enough for
many of its starters to take the second
half off and rest up for next week's
showdown with Alabama in the South-
eastern Conference Championship
Game.
It was a perfect send-off for the se-
niors on one of the nation's best de-
fenses, who expected to put the clamps
on an FSU offense that averaged 434
yards and 31 points per game before
Saturday.
Stamper and fellow starters Bran-
don Spikes and Jermaine Cunningham
played their final home game, and it
may have been the last go-round for
several juniors as well.
Defensive end Carlos Dunlap and
cornerback Joe Haden are highly rated
NFL Draft prospects, and tight end
Aaron Hernandez, safety Major Wright
and offensive linemen Mike and Maur-
kice Pouncey may also benefit from de-
claring early.
"I definitely took it all in a lot more,"
said Haden, who had an interception.
"I stayed in the locker room and kept
my pads on for a little longer and did a
lap after the game, just in case this was
my last game.
"I wanted to make sure I went out
doing stuff that I wanted to do."
Of those juniors, Hernandez made
his presence felt the most with five
catches for 83 yards and touchdowns
of 18 and 37 yards.
He punctuated the second by launch-
ing the ball into the stands, a tribute topast UF receivers Carlos Alvarez and
Andre Caldwell, who made their final
games in The Swamp memorable by
doing the same thing.
Spikes focused more on the turf
of Florida Field, kneeling to kiss the
ground in the south end zone during
his Senior Day introduction.
After the game, he was headed to
the locker room after a last wave to the
crowd, but he suddenly turned back,
grabbed some teammates and headed
to the midfield logo.
"I definitely took it all in a lot
more. I stayed in the locker
room and kept my pads on for a
little longer and did a lap after
the game, just in case this was
my last game."
Joe Haden
UF junior cornerback
He laid down, did his best impres-
sion of a snow angel and took pictures
with fellow seniors Stamper, David
Nelson, Riley Cooper, Brandon James,
Wondy Pierre-Louis, Markihe Ander-
son, and Dorian Munroe, who will ap-
ply for a sixth year of eligibility after
missing the last two seasons with knee
injuries.
Meyer, Haden and a few others
joined in, too.
None of them wanted the night to
end.
But the celebration couldn't last too
much longer.
Once the locker-room speeches
were over, it was time to get back to
business.
The Gators have a date with the
Crimson Tide looming, and a bad out-
ing next week will turn Saturday night
from a joyous stop along the path to
another title into a painful memory of
what could have been.Florida State @, Florida ff7
If Saturday was Hernandez's final game in The Swamp, he is sure
going to miss playing against Florida State. He has nine catches
for 144 yards and four touchdowns in his last two games against
the Seminoles. His second touchdown, a 37-yard catch-and-run
after a short pass, was absolutely absurd as he made FSU's entire
secondary miss and fall into one another. His heave afterwards
didn't make Urban Meyer too happy, but it's become a tradition for
great options in the Florida passing game -Carlos Alvarez (1968-
71) and Andre Caldwell (2003-07) did the same in their last games
in The Swamp. 5 rec, 83 yds, 2 TDAaron

In his final game in The Swamp, Florida fans got one last Tebow-
esque performance. FSU sure won't miss playing Tebow -the
senior will leave Gainesville with 927 total yards and 14 total
touchdowns in three starts against the Seminoles. He may have
solidified a return trip to New York with his third-highest completion T w
rate in three years as a starter. The Gators could use an effort like Tim Tebow
this from No. 15 when they play the Crimson Tide in their national QB, Sr.

sacks and had his first career forced fumble. With Jones out for the

Florida will host first, second round of NCAA Tournament
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achia ng@alligator org
In the quest to win their first vol-
leyball national championship, the
Gators won't have to go very far.
The NCAA Tournament bracket
came out on Sunday, and it was an-
nounced that No. 15 Florida (23-5,
16-4 Southeastern Conference) will
play at the O'Connell Center for the
first and second rounds. Gainesville
will alsobe one of four regional sites,
which were predetermined before
the season. The Final Four will be
held in Tampa on Dec. 17-19.
"We had anticipated and made
preparations to go on the road,"
coach Mary Wise said. "We figured
we would be in Tallahassee, so it
came as a surprise to us -but in this
case, it was a pleasant surprise."
UF received the No. 16 overall
seed and will play its first round
match Thursday against College of
Charleston (18-12, 12-4 Southern
Conference) at 7:30 p.m. Miami and
Florida International make up the
other half of the Gators' bracket.
"I think our 16th seed was a re-
sult of who we played and the fact
that we did have five wins over
those top teams (Stanford, Florida
State, Kentucky and Tennessee),"
Wise said.
But before Sunday's selection
show, UF had to finish off its regular
season over the weekend.
On Saturday, UF honored seniors
Elyse Cusack and Kristina Johnsonbefore a 3-1 win (25-13, 27-29, 25-15,
25-9) over No. 25 Notre Dame (21-6,
14-0 Big East).
Cusack served the first ball of the
match while still emotional from the
pregame ceremony.
"We had anticipated and
made preparations to go
on the road. We figured we
would be in Tallahassee, so
it came as a surprise to us
-but in this case, it was a
pleasant surprise."
Mary Wise
UF volleyball coach
"I think one of the hardest things
I've ever done since I've been here
was that first serve because I was
still fighting back tears," she said. "I
had to get over it really fast and start
the match."
However on a day that honored
the seniors, a junior stole the show.
Opposite hitter Callie Rivers
knocked down a season-high 14
kills to go along with a .500 hitting
efficiency and seven digs.
"It was the perfect match for us
going into the postseason to play a
team with little preparation time
and a team we are not as familiar
with," Wise said.
The Gators were also able to
experience a little adversity before
they entered the postseason as five
service errors in a single frame led to
a second-set loss.UF responded well as it went on the scheme once again. She totalled
to block seven balls in the next two 21 kills, 69 assists and dug up 16
sets and grab control of the match. balls during the weekend.
The one-setter offense was used In Friday's sweep of South Caro-
for most of the weekend as sopho- lina (14-16, 5-15 SEC), the new of-
more setter Kelly Murphy thrived in fense led to a dominant 3-0 win (25-14, 25-8, 25-12) and gave Wise her
600th career victory at UF.
The Gators recorded a season-
high hitting efficiency of .519 against
South Carolina and only committed
six attack errors.

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Three-point shooting leads Florida to win over FlU
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer

The consolation game of the FIU Thanks-
giving Classic in Miami had the reassuring
result the UF women's basketball team was
hoping for.
The Gators (3-3) played their second game
in U.S. Century Bank Arena and won 71-60
over FIU on Sunday behind improved shoot-
ing, including a 25-point performance by Jor-
dan Jones.
"When you win on someone else's home
floor, you have to be happy," coach Amanda
Butler said.
Coming off the 61-47 loss the team suf-
fered on Friday against St. John's, UF bended
but did not break against the Golden Pan-
thers."There was no doubt in my mind honestly
that we would win this game," Jones said. "I
know the fight of this team and the fight of
our coaching staff, and we knew we weren't
coming back to Gainesville winless."
UF led the game for the majority of the first
half before FIU (2-4) knotted the game at 25,
but a Jones 3-pointer -her first points of the
game -gave the Gators a lead they would
never give up, despite a feisty effort from the
Golden Panthers throughout the game.
Butler changed up the starting lineup from
Friday, plugging in Azania Stewart and Jen-
nifer George, and the new frontcourt yielded
results. The pair only combined for 10 points,
but also chipped in 11 rebounds.
Feeding the ball to the post was a fo-
cal point for the team in practice be-
tween the two tournament games."Our post was huge," Jones said. "They de-
manded the ball. The post set the tone and we
followed their lead. One of our main goals of
this game was to not let teams think we're
just an outside team."
Sharielle Smith notched
12 points and was one
rebound shy of a double-
double. Fellow senior Steffi
Sorensen chipped in 10
points after going score-
less against St. John's but
Jones continued to make her
presence felt on the boards
as she finished with eight rebounds, five of
which were offensive boards.
Jones was the biggest beneficiary of the
improved post game. She scored 17 second-
half points and lit up the Panthers, going 9of 16 from the field, including a 50 percent
effort from beyond the arc. The whole team
rebounded from a pedestrian shooting night
on Friday and nailed 12 of 26 3-pointers in the
game.
Despite the Gators' superior offensive sta-
tistics, FIU clawed until the end of the game
coming within 4 points. The teams traded
turnovers, and it wasn't until Jones and So-
rensen drained four consecutive free throws
-UF's first made free throws of the night -
that the game was put out of reach.
"That's what makes us confident that we
can play with anyone in the country. It's not
our size, our athleticism, our experience -
it's none of those things," Butler said. "It's
our fight. That's where our confidence is
rooted."

show their potential and anoth-
er chance to silence their critics.
Florida has met and ex-
ceeded expectations at nearly
every turn so far this year, eas-
ily disposing of its outmatched
opponents and raising its game
to another level against higher-
caliber teams like Florida State
and MSU.
"After the FSU game, we
felt good about ourselves. We
knew we could play with any-one in the country," said junior
forward Chandler Parsons, who
led five Gators in double figures
against the Spartans with 14
points. "I think we got a good
chance to prove it, and we've
got a good chance to get better
and move forward."
But the Gators did even more
than prove their worth early in
the season.
With a victory against the
second-ranked team in the
country, they finally have the
kind of signature win absent the
past two seasons -and it mayhave significantly boosted their
chances of getting back to the
NCAA Tournament.
Friday night's victory was
the program's
biggest since
the second na-
tional cham-
Men's pionship, and
it broughtBasketball Florida some
national atten-
tion, but the follow-up proved
that the Gators are ready to stay
in the limelight a little longer.
"Tonight we came out andwe wanted to show everyone
that last night's game wasn't
a fluke, and we wanted to re-
spond after the win," freshman
guard Kenny Boynton said Sat-
urday. "We've heard people say
we're soft, so we basically want-
ed to put pressure on both these
teams early and get the wins."
Boynton and the Gators got
the win they wanted, the win
they needed -and the win that
might be pointed to down the
road as the one that put Florida
basketball on the road to re-
demption.

intercepted Manuel at the end

Adrian Bushell picked him off
on a fade route in the end zone
to end the game.
"What really made me kind
of surprised was how they
kept trying to score at the end
of the game," Stamper said.
"There's a couple seconds left,
the game's over. .We were
just anxious to get on the field
and embrace all these memo-
ries that we have."

That's not a team trying to
win. That's a team trying to save
face.
The Gators and Seminoles
will always be rivals -I'm not
trying to say otherwise -but
right now that rivalry is at an all-
time low.
For that matter, so is pretty
much every other one of UF's
rivalries.
Since becoming head coach
in 2005, Urban Meyer is 15-1
against traditional foes Georgia,
FSU, Tennessee and Miami.
In my opinion, no one has
rivaled Florida during that five-
year stretch, least of all those
four teams.
UF's rivals have been the '90s
Nebraska teams, the turn-of-the-
century USC teams and the '80s
Miami teams.
Tim Tebow hasn't been ri-
valed by Matt Stafford, Sam
Bradford or Darren McFadden.
Instead, he's been rivaling
Danny Wuerffel, Archie Griffin
and Herschel Walker.
The only rivals for the Gators
during these last five years are
history and greatness. And
that's what struck me the most
as the Seminoles "cut" the lead
to 30-3 on the foot of their fresh-
man kicker.
The postgame atmosphere
was one-of-a-kind, as fans bid
adieu to perhaps the greatest
player and the greatest senior
class in college football history.
For any big-time recruit in atten-
dance, I can't imagine wanting
the chance to play anywhere else
in the country.
Come to Florida. Shame your
rivals. Win national champion-
ships. Do it all in front of an in-
credible fan base that treats play-
ers like family.
That's quite a sales pitch.
No one wanted Senior Day to
end because everyone knew that
it can't, and won't, always be
like this in games like that.
Except for the Seminoles.
I'm sure they're ready to get
back to that whole "equal" thing
as soon as possible.
