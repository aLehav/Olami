NEW PORT RICHEY (AP) — A 32-year-old Pasco Coun-
ty man who called 911 to complain about his mother is fac-
ing criminal charges. According to a sheriff's office arrest report, Charles Dennison told a deputy that his mother took his beer and he wanted her arrested. Dennison was report-edly "very intoxicated" when the deputy arrived at the New Port Richey home.
Dennison told the deputy that he would keep calling 
emergency responders if his mother wasn't charged. He has been charged with making false 911 calls and was jailed on $150 bond.

Student fees are rising – again.
After Gov. Charlie Crist signed a bill on Friday giving uni-
versities a one-time opportunity to raise student fees higher than normal, UF’s fees could rise by $5.79 per credit hour .
Usually, UF can only raise fees by 5 percent each year, 
which is $1.15 per credit hour. However, the University Fee Committee submitted recommendations to the UF Board of 
Trustees for additional fees Tuesday.
If the committee and the board approve all of the fees, it 
will cost students taking 15 credit hours an extra $87 each 
semester. 
The UF committee unanimously supported three of the 
four student fees proposed by UF President Bernie Machen on Tuesday. The committee must submit all decision to the 
Board of Trustees, UF's highest governing body, by next 
week.
The Activity and Service Fee funds Student Government 
by charging students $1.20 per credit. Another fee approved will charge students $1 per credit to fund mental health care 
once UF completes evaluations for the services. The last fee approved is 60 cents per credit in order to exempt research 
and teaching assistants from paying anything greater than 
the $1.15 per-credit fee that passed in December.
Student members of the committee, who represent the 
Student Body, did not support Machen’s plan for undergrad-
uates to pay for graduate students’ health insurance.
Machen proposed a $1.84 per-credit fee to pay for about 
40 percent of graduate students’ health care.
Whether or not the additional fee goes through, teaching 
assistants and research assistants are exempt from all new fees.  
UF Student Body President Ash-
ton Charles, who is a graduate stu-
dent, said graduate students’ health care is important, but undergraduates should not be forced to pay for it.
The Student Senate budget appropriations chair, T.J. Vil-
lamil, said that the per-credit fee will ultimately help under-
graduates because it will bring better teachers’ assistants and 
research assistants to the university, but acknowledged that 
the fee is a substantial cost for unprepared undergraduates.
“It’s a lot for undergraduates to front,” he said.During the meeting, Machen pointed to the success of the Fees may rise by 25 percentSTUDENT GOVERNMENT

Student Government senators unanimously 
passed a bill on Tuesday that is intended to 
make absentee voting easier for students dur-
ing SG elections, particularly for students at UF’s satellite campuses. 
Satellite campuses are located in cities 
throughout  the state, including  Orlando, Jack-
sonville and St. Petersburg.
The Satellite Campus 
Voter Participation Act, 
drafted by members of the 
Student Alliance party, 
requires the supervisor of elections to provide a bal-lot on the SG website and notify all students that 
the ballot is available two 
weeks before the submis-
sion deadline. 
Senator Graham Clark, 
who represents the Student Alliance party, said the bill was necessary because the current absentee ballot sys-tem is difficult to use.
“We just think that it 
would be nice to make things easier for these guys,” Clark said. 
The amendment passed 
with a vote of 50 to 18.
Currently, SG staff members send the link 
to the absentee ballot via the Gator Times, said Ben Meyers of the Unite Party.
“Most of what is said in this legislation is al-
ready done,” he said.
Senators also passed a resolution support-
ing the Florida American Legion Boys State and 
Florida American Legion Auxiliary Girls State 
programs and encouraging more support for the programs from UF.

STATE
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — The political unknown once 
tapped by Gov. Charlie Crist to lead the state 
GOP was arrested Wednesday on charges he ran a scam to bilk the party, officials said.
The Florida Department of Law Enforce-
ment took former state GOP Chairman Jim Greer, 47, into custody at his Orlando-area home. He is charged with one count of orga-nized fraud, four counts of felony grand theft and one count of money laundering, said Wil-liam Shepherd, Florida’s statewide prosecu-tor. Through his attorney, Greer denied the charges.
Crist, who abandoned the Republican Par-
ty to run for U.S. Senate as an independent, said Wednesday that he was surprised by the arrest and knew nothing of Greer’s alleged wrongdoing.
“Sometimes you’re disappointed by peo-
ple,” he told a news conference in Tallahassee. “I do not feel complicit.”
He said he had not been questioned by 
investigators and did not expect his ties with 
Greer to hurt his campaign, though his oppo-
nents quickly pounced, with tea party favorite Marco Rubio’s campaign sending out press releases Wednesday emphasizing them. Crist dropped out of the GOP when it became clear that he could not beat Rubio in August’s GOP 
primary
Greer, a small town vice mayor, was a sur-
prise pick for party chairman after he led local 
efforts to help Crist get elected in 2006. He pre-viously was the president and CEO of a com-pany that provides training to the hospitality industry on how to comply with alcohol laws.
Crist defended his friend even as reports 
surfaced that Greer had used party funds on 
ritzy hotels, gourmet restaurants and private 
jets. Greer stepped down in February.
Shepherd said Wednesday that Greer’s 
scam involved funneling GOP money to a company called Victory Strategies that he se-cretly controlled. On Greer’s orders, the Re-publican Party of Florida paid Victory Strate-gies for campaign work, much of which was never performed, and gave the company a 10 
percent cut of major donations that Greer and 
his top assistant, Delmar Johnson, took.
Greer got about $125,000 of the almost 
$200,000 that the party paid Victory Strategies, while Johnson was paid more than $65,000, the statewide prosecutor said. Johnson is helping with the investigation and will not be charged, prosecutors said. He declined comment when contacted by text message Wednesday.Asked at a news conference why only Greer 
has been charged, Shepherd replied: “He was 
the one who attempted to keep it known from 
the people who were paying him the money, that it was actually going to him.”
Greer was having money problems last 
year and had overdrawn his bank accounts six times, including one $25,000 overdraft. A Republican Party donor started sending Greer $10,000 a month after receiving a plea for fi-
nancial help, according to a 
search warrant for Greer’s 
home released Wednesday.
Greer was released late 
Wednesday on $105,000 bail. His attorney, Damon Chase, described the allega-
tions as a conflict with the Republican Party of Florida over contracts and money 
that had wrongly turned into a criminal mat-ter because the party was losing the dispute. He also said that party officials were aware of Greer’s role in Victory Strategies.
“It started going the way the Republican 
Party didn’t want it to go,” Chase said of the dispute. “Rather than just working it out civ-illy in court, they decided to hand it over to a grand jury and have him indicted. Because they control the state of Florida, they were able to do that.”
State Sen. John Thrasher, who replaced 
Greer as chairman, tried to push the scandal squarely onto Crist.
“Whether he knew about Victory Strate-
gies — he says he didn’t, I take him at his word for that — but I don’t think he can walk away from the fact that this guy at one time was your best buddy in politics, that you relied on day in and day out,” Thrasher said. “And now 
say that because he’s been indicted, I never 
had anything to do with it.”
Statements for party-issued American Ex-
press credit cards show Greer usually traveled with Crist, staying at top-tier hotels and dining in fancy restaurants. Greer also brought along a mini-entourage of his own on most trips.
The statements released this month de-
tailed more than $7 million in charges on cards 
held by 30 elected and party officials and their 
staff during Greer’s three years as chairman.
Rubio, a former state House speaker, 
charged nearly $110,000 to a party-issued card, including repairs to Rubio’s family minivan, grocery bills, plane tickets for his wife, and retail purchases, including one from a wine store. Campaign aides have said the charges were legitimate.

Steven Noll, a professor in the UF department of history, has 
been given the Florida Historical Society’s 2010 Rembert Patrick 
Award for his recently published book, “Ditch of Dreams: The Cross Florida Barge Canal and the Struggle for Florida’s Fu-ture.”
The book, which was co-authored by Santa Fe College his-
tory professor Dave Tegeder, examines the effort to dig a canal across Florida, according to a press release from the UF news 
desk. Noll and Tegeder received the award for their 352-page book at the historical society’s an-nual meeting in St. Augustine on May 27, accord-ing to the release. 
The Rembert Patrick Award each year goes to authors who 
write scholarly books about the history of Florida, according to 
the FHS website.
“Ditch of Dreams” which was published by the University 
of Florida Press in 2009, details the nearly 50-year fight by resi-
dent environmentalists against the construction of a canal across the heart of Florida, according to the University Press of Florida website.
“Ditch of Dreams” is Noll’s third book. He wrote “Feeble-
Minded in our Midst” in 1995 and “Mental Retardation in America” in 2004.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 3, 2010

University will collect $7.5 million if Board of Trustees approves fees 
current graduate student health program, 
which has been in existence for four years.
“It’s a significant recruiting tool,” Ma-
chen said.
More than 4,500 graduate students use 
the health insurance, he said. Individual graduate student coverage is free, he said, but graduate students do have to pay for family coverage. But Charles said charging undergraduates for a program that only benefits graduate students could be danger-
ous during a recession.
“I definitely like where the needs are be-
ing addressed,” she said. “My only prob-
lem is I’m a little hesitant to raise it to the 
full amount entirely. It’s a tough economic 
time.”
Charles and Machen made proposals and 
counter-proposals on Tuesday for how the 
fee should be used, but they were not able to 
come to an agreement.
“You need to wrassle with this,” Machen 
told the committee. The committee delayed the decision on 
the graduate health care fee until Friday.
Charles stressed the 
need for the committee 
to continue researching 
where the funding can 
go. Alternative sources 
of funding for gradu-
ate health care should be sought, she said.
“We owe it to the entire 
Student Body,” Charles said in a later inter-view. “If there’s another area where those needs can be addressed, we need to find it.”
The current fee system is complicated, 
said David Kratzer, chair of the committee.
The three fees recommended at the com-
mittee meeting on Tuesday add an extra 
$2.70 per-credit hike.
The $3.95 per-credit in approved fees will 
collect about $4.5 million for SG and stu-
dent services. If the full $5.79 per credit is charged, then the university will collect $7.5 
million in fees. The committee will meet Fri-
day to determine how to use the remaining 
$1.84 per-credit fee.FEES , from page 1OnCampu s

Professor gets 
history awardBy ELIZABETH BEHRMAN

The School Board of Alachua 
County voted Tuesday night 
to implement a district-wide 
school uniform requirement for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. 
Beginning in the fall, stu-
dents will be required to wear uniforms consisting of solid-colored pants, shorts or skirts and a solid-colored shirt or 
blouse with a collar. The colors 
of the uniforms will be chosen by the individual schools.
The five-member board ap-
proved the plan in a 3-2 deci-
sion.
“The kids, unfortunately, 
are getting more and more out-
rageous with the clothes they 
wear,” school board chair-
woman Virginia Childs said.Students have been coming 
to school wearing slippers, pa-jama bottoms, baggy pants and overly revealing tops, she said.
“It’s very distracting for 
other people in the class to have that show going on,” she said. 
Childs said the new policy 
will not only help students 
focus more on their studies, 
but she expects it 
will help alleviate bullying and peer 
pressure.
Tina Pinkoson, who voted 
against the uniform policy, said 
she was surprised it passed be-cause she has gotten mostly 
negative feedback on the issue.
Pinkoson said it should be 
the parents’ responsibility to 
tell their children what to wear. 
She also said school uniforms 
will become a financial burden on the school district when it has to purchase the clothes for 
students who are unable to af-
ford them.
“I don’t think that it has 
anything to do with the aca-demic learning that’s going 
on in the schools,” she said. 
“There [are] bigger fish to fry, and we should be looking at those issues.”
Wiley Dixon, principal of 
Gainesville High School, said the seven high school princi-pals in Alachua County sent a letter to the board recom-
mending the policy not be ap-
proved. 
The principals felt such a 
policy in high schools was un-
necessary because there was 
never a problem with enforc-ing the old dress code, he said.
“We just felt that with young 
adults, they should be able to 
choose what they wear so long 
as it was within the school board policies,” he said. THURSDAY, JUNE 3, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5
� THE MOWER USES GPS 
AND COST $15,000.

Three UF engineering stu-
dents and a UF graduate will try 
to mow down their competition  today.
The  team’s GPS-guided lawn 
mower will compete in the sev-enth annual Institute of Naviga-tion Robotic Lawn Mower Com-petition in Beavercreek, Ohio until Saturday.
Fifteen teams from the U.S. 
and Canada will try to cut at least 75 percent of a 150-square-meter lawn in the most “aesthetically 
pleasing” manner, according to the competition’s rulebook. First 
prize in the “basic” category, which the UF team entered, is $2,500.
Mike Franks, 30, Colin Watson, 
21, Owen Allen, 25, and Andres Vargas, 23, have worked since January on the mower, which is intended to mow more accurate-ly and time-efficiently than other self-propelled lawn mowers with the help from a GPS.  
The system cost $15,000 and 
was borrowed from UF’s Center for Intelligent Machines and Ro-botics.
Franks, an electrical engineer-
ing senior, said the UF team’s machine mows on a preset path.
“[It] mows more like a per-
son would mow a lawn,” Franks said.Team enters lawn

Today’s question: Should grad students pay for their own health care?Tuesday’s question: Should UF’s campus be a smoke-free zone?
150 TOTAL VOTES62% YES38% NOFor too long, environmental conservation 
has been a cause championed by liberals.  
Even though most members from both sides of the po-
litical spectrum, myself included, recognize the importance of environmental preservation and want to work to protect 
our planet, only liberals seem to lay claim to the issue.
This is happening for two reasons. For one, the media 
have only advertised regulation-increasing policies as envi-
ronmental progress. Leftist environmental activists love to promote regulations and bureaucratic solutions as “prog-ress” toward preserving the environment. Additionally, the conservative media have never embraced the idea of a right-wing environmental effort, preferring to focus criticism on the extreme elements in the environmental movement.
Herein lies the problem: We need to recognize that un-
abashedly liberal ideas to environmental preservation are not the only viable solutions, and sometimes they aren’t vi-able at all. My first example is the spikedace disaster in the upper Verde River in Arizona. Environmentalist groups sued the U.S. Forest Service to prevent cattle grazing on the riverbanks to try to preserve the spikedace, a species of fish. The environmentalists won, and regulations were enacted to inhibit cattle grazing. This was lauded as environmental 
“progress” even though the spikedace disappeared from the 
area shortly after. Because the cattle were gone, there were no animals to eat the shrubs and bushes that soon overgrew the river banks. This changed the river’s ecosystem entirely. In another case, consider the radical push by liberal envi-ronmentalists to replace every American light bulb with a CFL (the long-lasting, spiral-looking ones). Nancy Pelosi’s “Greening the Capitol” installed more than 13,000 of these in our nation’s legislative home. The only problem being that 
the CFL light bulb contains enough mercury that, if broken, 
can be harmful to fetuses, pets and human health in general.
There needs to be an alternative, one that invites citizens 
to participate in environmental preservation willingly, in-stead of forcefully by increasing bureaucratic regulations. A conservative environmentalist ap-proach would promote individuals to use their own creativity to produce rewards and achieve measurable en-
vironmental results, not compounding regulation.
Instead of blanket regulations to solve a distant problem, 
the government should work to promote individual partici-pation in the conservation effort. Bureaucracies are restric-tive and risk-adverse. For bureaucrats, “cover your ass,” is the modus operandi. They’re much more worried about do-ing something now that might be criticized later than they are about taking an initiative to cure an immediate problem. What have the Feds done to stop or clean up the spewing oil in the Gulf? Virtually nothing. In fact, they seem to have sty-
mied some promising initiatives that have been proposed.
For instance, Gov. Bobby Jindal has asked for the con-
struction of barrier islands to prevent the oil from flooding 
into the Louisiana marshlands. Kevin Costner has proposed a plan involving a new centrifuge that may help clean up the spill. I am not saying these are the right or wrong solutions, but this represents the private innovation necessary to handle the greatest environmental challenges. The government is “evaluating” Costner’s centrifuges, but this is an emergency. 
What’s the holdup? In these two cases, it’s as if the house is 
on fire. Jindal and Costner have shown up with some new-fangled fire hoses and the Feds are saying, “Whoa! We have to take a long, slow look at those things before using them.” 
Liberal environmentalists will continue to believe hu-
mans are the problem. I advocate that we are the solution to promoting sustainable solutions to a nature-human coop-erative. Mike Rowe, of “Dirty Jobs,” says the green move-ment should be renamed the “brown movement” because 
individuals do the dirty work and interact with the environ-
ment daily, unlike the lofty and removed “green” politician. I agree. It is with the citizens that the most good can be ac-complished toward preserving the environment.
Bryan Griffin is a first-year law student Individual action key to conservationAnother $4.64 in fees is going to be tacked onto the 
cost of a credit hour at UF, and it’s a hard pill to swallow since part of it ensures that graduate stu-
dents get access to free health care at the cost of under-graduates.
UF has been trying to fund the program ever since it 
approved giving grad students free health care four years 
ago. But it was not able to secure funding from the state or 
anywhere else.
We are not against giving our teaching assistants and 
future professors free trips to the doctor; they pay a higher tuition rate and work hard in order to teach us lowly un-
dergraduates. But we think someone else should get stuck 
with the bill.
The university line is that these new benefits will attract 
more and better grad students who will be able to provide 
better education to UF’s undergraduates. It makes sense 
when we try not to think too hard about it, but the reason-ing quickly falls apart under the lightest scrutiny.
People choose to get their post-graduate degrees at UF 
for one reason: It will further their careers. Whether they 
have access to free health care is not and will never be the 
deciding factor. This is an unfair fee passed along to us with a healthy dose of faulty logic. Make no mistake, this is all about making UF look better on paper.
This fee keeps Machen’s goal of making UF a top-level 
school moving forward by devoting more money to grad-uate programs at the expense of undergraduates. Couple this with his cuts in undergrad enrollment in order to give us a better student-teacher ratio, and we end up with a de-
clining population footing the bill for a ballooning number 
of post-graduates.
If the fee were to bring more graduate students and 
give us smaller class sizes we might see some benefits. 
But instead of trying to change UF and make it look better 
in theory, Bernie Machen should be focusing on keeping costs down, so the university remains the top choice for kids growing up in Florida. UF is one of the least expen-sive schools to attend in the state, and we get great value 
for our money by going to school here. If we keep increas-
ing the cost in order to meet the average fees imposed by the other state schools, we will effectively be weeding out potential Gators based on how much they can afford to 
pay for a college education.
Last time we checked, state schools were supposed to 
strive toward educating everyone they could to the best 
level they could – not rearrange and divert money, so they can pretend to be a viable 50,000-student faux Ivy Leaguer 
in order to move up a couple rankings on an inconsequen-
tial list.
Had the university decided that it would give every 
student health care, we would support it and be happy 
to pay for it. How much would it cost in fees? A lot more, 
but it would be less expensive than health insurance and may even save students and their parents a good deal of money. 
But who are we kidding? That is a ludicrous idea under 
our current leadership, as it would do nothing to close the 
gap between the university’s undergraduate and graduate 
spending.Rip-off
Health care fee unfair to

Letter to the Editor
Group asks residents to protest Israeli assault on the 
Gaza Freedom Flotilla.
The Gainesville branch of the International Socialist 
Organization is calling on Gainesville residents, religious 
groups and student organizations to come out this Mon-
day to publicly denounce the illegal Israeli assault on the 
Gaza Freedom Flotilla in international waters Monday.   
We will be meeting on the corner of Williston Road 
and Southwest 34th Street at 4 p.m. 
The actions of the Israeli military against the flotilla are 
inexcusable, and the explanation of self-defense is ridicu-lous.  
One of the world’s most advanced military forces can-not claim self-defense against a group of unarmed aid ac-tivists.  
The Israeli blockade of Gaza is an assault upon the 
impoverished population suffering under Israeli occupa-tion.  
International support should be on the side of the Gaza 
Freedom Flotilla, made up of courageous aid activists 
only hoping to help the dire conditions of those living in 
Gaza.  
We urge Rep. Cliff Stearns to denounce the assault. We demand that the Obama Administration condemn 
Israel’s actions and support an unbiased international commission, which is not led by Israel, to investigate the attack and to hold the Israeli government accountable for its actions. 
We resent the use of the “terrorism card” by the Israeli 
government for justifying the assault upon a flotilla care-fully planned and prepared with international support for months in advance ─ a flotilla carrying no rockets whatso-
ever, but 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid instead. 
We encourage all conscientious Gainesville residents 
to join us in solidarity with those killed and injured, those living under occupation and with the Gaza Freedom Movement.

ONLINETHIS WEEKEND
Visit www.alligator.org/the_av-
enue for a plethora of content, 
including all past stories, color 
cartoons, photos and other mis-cellaneous digitial musings. This 
week's online only stories:
Avenue writer Kat Bein explores the final frontier with "Super Ma-
rio Galaxy 2."
Britt Perkins reviews the latest literary mash-up novel “Android 
Karenina.”Youth soccer fills void for sports fans in summer
Summer is a hard time for sports fans. 
As the NBA and NHL playoffs come to a close, fans are left trying to subsist off of 
the meager pickings of summer sports. 
Baseball is mentally draining to follow, es-
pecially if you weren’t lucky enough to enlist in a fantasy baseball league back in April. And the WNBA? Not a worthwhile sport, as proven by the Bill Simmons’ Lincoln Test. 
If you were given the choice of having your 
favorite WNBA team win a championship or finding a five-dollar bill, you’re going with Abe Lincoln. 
Luckily, there’s one event this year that 
throws a dash of excitement into the summer sports doldrums, one where soccer teams from all over converge to play each other. I’m talking, of course, about Disney’s Memorial Day Soccer Shootout, where my little sister was competing this past weekend. 
My family made the pilgrimage to Disney’s 
Wide World of Sports Complex to watch the spectacle. While the event was admittedly 
short on excitement and athletic skill, I was 
able to make a few observations.First, the majority of 
youth soccer parents are decent people, but the bad apples eas-ily ruin the whole time 
for everyone. There’s 
nothing quite like watching a full-grown father nearly have a conniption fit yelling at his daughter. When  some father is yelling 
at his increasingly tired daughter the painfully obvious directions on how to play a sport the 
adult has never played, it’s column material. 
Some high decibel gems from this weekend: “Score a goal!”; “Kick the ball!”; “Get her!”; “If you don’t make a goal, we’re not feeding you tonight!”
My family and I are a bunch of degener -
ates. My sister’s team was playing two games in one day on Saturday, so naturally we de -
cided to stock our cooler with well-concealed 
beer. 
However, Disney doesn’t allow glass or al-cohol in coolers, or so said the gatekeeper. 
However, the stalwart sentry (Mouseketeer?) made the mistake of trusting my mother when she said neither material was in our cooler. 
In short, my mother lied twice. I’m thinking 
this means that she can no longer lecture me on anything, ever (Mom’s note: Yeah, right). Also, nobody seems to find it weird when you’re drinking “water” out of red Solo cups. 
Unfortunately, my sister’s team was 
knocked out in the semifinals. I’m nearly cer -
tain the other team cheated, though. Disney’s age verification policies must be as lax as their alcohol security, because some of the girls on 
the “14 and under” team looked so old they 
had started to grow facial hair. I might have taken their center back to the senior prom.
As you’ve grown to expect from me, dear 
readers, I found a bright side to this harrow -
ing Memorial Day weekend foray into the world of youth soccer. I told my sister I would buy her ice cream if she scored a goal, and she was shut out the whole tournament. 
I saved four bucks and taught my sister a 
valuable lesson: Only winners get ice cream.  Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff

Everyone’s seen ‘em on ACRs, red-
necks and, most recently, hipsters.
No, I’m not talking about PBR Tall 
Boys. I’m talking jorts here, people.
And you need to take pride in them 
because, somehow, they’ve escaped 
the reign of douche-dom and are look -
ing pretty rad around campus.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: 
“I’m not wearing those, they look so hick-like.”
Jorts aren’t a fashion statement; 
they signify a lifestyle. After all, the Ur -
bandictionary.com listing for jorts is practically calling us out.
It defines them as, “jean shorts, 
such as those worn by male Florida Gator fans at the Georgia-Florida foot-ball game.”
My jort retort:Hell yeah, I’m wearing a gnarly pair 
of jorts. And hell yeah, that’s my team down there whooping some Bulldog tail.I don’t look at them as a mere pair 
of jean shorts. I see them as a pair of de facto championship rings for your legs.
Riding your bike on a hot summer 
day and don’t want people to see that you have a bad case of the swamp booty?
Put on your jorts.At a Florida-Georgia game and don’t 
want people to see the tear stains from your sore-losing Bulldog opponents?
Put on your jorts (they are super ab-
sorbent).
And let’s talk a little about the rules 
of jorts. Think of them as “jordinanc-es.”
1. Jorts can be hemmed or not. For 
the pinnacle of jort fashion, go with the 
carpenter loop for added utility.
2. If you’re a girl who can pull it off, 
cut them as high as decency will allow.
3. They’re just better when they’re 
made from a pair of worn jeans.
4. Don’t wear your jorts too tight. 
Bulldogs don’t think torn inseams are 
intimidating.
Real Gators sport the jorts.Jorts mark Gator pride

UF Comedy Team to perform in Aspen for second time
By JON SILMAN
avenue editor  
The UF Stand Up Comedy Team has made 
it to the Funniest Four of The Rooftop Comedy 
National College Comedy Competition for the second consecutive year. The fabulous foursome 
are: Rudy “Glitter Machine” Mendoza, Calvin 
“Time Hooker” Cole, Tim “Shadow Box” Keck and Brian “New Guy” Amos.
Next Thursday, 7:30 p.m. Eastern Standard 
Time, UF will be spouting comedic gold at the Wheeler Opera House in Aspen, Colo., against Xavier University. There will be a live viewing party in the Weimer Hall auditorium, and you can also watch the action live on the Internet at Rooftop-
comedy.com. We caught up with Gainesville’s top 
comedic masterminds to talk about the cultural implications and the significance of Neo-Marxist literature in a post post-modern age. Well, sorta.
Avenue: What happened last year? You came in second?
Rudy: Uh. That’s debatable. We were like ei-
ther third or fourth place.
A: How did it feel to get eliminated?Rudy: Very shitty.Calvin: Rudy’s the guy to ask about failure.Rudy: I didn’t go in there thinking we were go-
ing to win the whole thing, but I was really hoping we weren’t gonna lose ‘cause the first day was the first round. So if we lost, then we’d just be 
losers for the rest of the days.
A: What was your go-to coping mechanism for 
losing?
Tim: I got really, just, angry for a long time. I 
for one have had nightmares about that show for 
the past year. I just really hope to go back and get some.
A: Redemption?Tim: Want some redemption.
A: Revenge is best served cold. ‘Cause it’s As-
pen, and it’s cold there.Tim: Exactly. Wanna go drop the d*** on 
‘em.
Calvin: Just on the peaks.
A: Calvin, did you drink a lot when you lost?Calvin: A good amount. The thing is, because 
of the altitude you get drunker a lot faster.
A: So new guy, you didn’t go last time? Ex-
cited?
New guy: Yes, definitely. I do stand up so ...A: Talk about the school rivalry aspect.
Calvin: I hate Temple with a fiery undying pas-
sion.
A: Like a Baptist preacher?
Calvin: They are the Satan to my evangelist.Rudy: I watched the bowl game, and they got 
their asses handed to them, so that was nice.
A: What about jorts?Calvin: The only time you can wear jorts is if 
you were wearing like jeans and you got like at-
tacked by a wolverine.
A: So new guy, you’re kinda quiet over there.New guy: Could you just attribute something 
witty Calvin said to me?
Calvin: If you do that I will sue the pants off 
the Alligator.
A: You won’t get much. New guy, how do you 
prepare for a show?
New guy: Well, I mostly perform in bars so a 
few drinks.
A: Do you have a drinking problem?
New guy: I mean, it’s more of an issue.
Tim: It’s more of a drinking solution.
A: Let’s do some word associations. Uni-
corns.
New guy: Aren’t real?A: Wearing women’s clothing?Calvin: For women I recommend it.A: Rudy, if you were lying about what you were 
wearing right now, what would you say?
Rudy: OK I’m wearing just glitter. I dunno. I 
rubbed glue on myself, and I just rolled in some glitter. And I’m just a glitter machine, man.humor  

  You can’t describe summertime in 
Gainesville. You have to experience it – the 98- 
degree temperatures, 110 percent humidity, 
mosquitoes the size of cockroaches and sweat stains galore. It’s a time when even a brief walk to class leaves you with a swamp in your pants. 
So how can you beat the heat in one of the 
few cities in Florida that doesn’t have a beach? Lucky for us beach-a-holics, Gainesville apart-ments have tried to ease our ocean withdraw-als with some awesome pools. But which ones 
are the best? Which ones will let you get your 
tan on, and which ones might leave you feeling high and dry? 
  Let’s start with the Estates. It’s legendary for 
its insane pool parties, which bring in thousands 
of students for free beer, vodka and other swag. 
But what if you want to go to the pool on a day when there aren’t droves of people invading the poolside? Well there’s good news: It’s still the 
most lenient on letting people drink around the 
pool and allowing guests to stay without a resi-dent around, according to former resident Mike Hughes, 22, a music performance major. 
  “Even when there aren’t pool par-
ties, there are still plenty of kids lying out with drinks,” Hughes said. “And I’ve never seen anyone get kicked out for lying out without a resident right next to them.”
Gainesville Place is another pool haven, with 
a pool for partying and even another pool for reading and relaxing. But obviously we’re here 
to talk about their party pool, which includes a 
waterfall, volleyball net and basketball hoop. It’s also one of the most lax complexes on al-lowing visitors to stay without a guest.
  “People that aren’t with residents never get 
kicked out,”  resident Darlos Sandoval, 20, a UF junior, said. “The only hard thing, maybe, is getting in without the key card.” 
  Sandoval also raved about the in-pool 
waterfall, which he said seems to be his friend’s favorite feature about the pool, ex-cept, of course, for their ﬂ  exible drinking rules.Next up, Campus Lodge, which according to the 
apartment’s website, houses Gainesville’s larg-
est play-action pool. 
According to resident Hailee Mertz, 22, 
a former music major, hanging out without a resident and drinking poolside aren’t big 
problems. Mertz also gave brownie points 
for how clean the pool is, telling me that they even have “... someone come out every morn-ing to take care of trash and to ﬁ  x the chairs.” 
Hidden Lake is also a semi-celebrity among lo-
cal pools, complete with foosball and ping pong tables. They are extremely laid back about drinking, but beware of glass bottles. 
“Drinking by the pool actually isn’t the prob-
lem, but they don’t like glass in the pool. So if you’re drinking out of a glass bottle, they might make you throw it away,” said Jason Haynes, a 19-year-old philosophy major. 
As far as going without a resident, Haynes 
gave another warning.   “They do ask if you’re a resident at the pool, 
but as long as you have someone with you that lives there it should all be gravy. They don’t re-ally have a limit, to my knowledge, as to how many guests you can bring.”
  Last but not least, the farther away but still fantastic Cabana Beach pool. This baby has an entire beach next to the pool deck and might be the closest thing to a Gainesville has to a real beach. Keeping up with the relaxed beach atmosphere, drinking is always allowed pool-
side. Be wary of the pool parties though, which 
resident Sean Saley, 20, said are notorious for being too rowdy. 
  “Cops shouldn’t have to show up every time 
because of ﬁ  ghts, but I guess that’s what hap-pens when more than half the people that go to the parties aren’t even students.”
  So if you’re picking which pool you’ll be grac-
ing with your presence, check out this chart to 
make sure the pool your picking meets all of 
your criteria for pool heaven. THURSDAY, JUNE 3, 2010  � ALLIGATOR, 11

TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG� N0. 4 UF TO TAKE ON NO. 
5 UCLA TODAY AT 3:30 P.M.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
OKLAHOMA CITY – Suppos-
edly the third time is the charm. 
If that adage holds true, Florida 
could return to Gainesville as soft-
ball’s national champion. 
After reaching the Women’s 
College World Series and falling 
just short of a title in 2008 and 2009, the No. 4 Gators (48-8) will begin their quest to turn their third consecutive trip to Oklahoma City into an NCAA championship when they take on No. 5 UCLA (45-11) today at 3:30 p.m.
The 2008 WCWS semifinal 
loss to Texas A&M and the 2009 WCWS final loss to Washington have proven to be a motivational force for all of this season’s juniors and seniors. 
“I think we all kind of had that 
taste still in our mouth from last year and that’s my driving factor,” junior ace Stephanie Brombacher said. “I want to get back there and just show people that we’re back and we can do this and we and coach (Tim) Walton have built a great program here.” 
Florida’s previous trips to the 
WCWS provide much more than inspiration, as they have also sup-plied UF with an experience level few schools can match. 
The team’s seven upperclass-
men will be making their third trip to the WCWS, while Walton will be making his sixth after making 
three consecutive trips as an assis-
tant with the University of Okla-
homa. 
“The first year here was very 
different,” Walton said. “It was 
difficult to adjust to everything 
that was going on but you live and learn and you just adjust as you go.”
And while past experience can 
be very helpful in handling the 
immense pressure, huge crowds 
and media frenzy, there are also a number of benefits that directly af-
fect how the game is played on the 
diamond. Walton specifically recalls that 
the field played very hard in pre-
vious years, and that the weather 
and the stadium structure some-
times combined to turn a routine 
fly ball into an adventure. 
“I know the sun in right field is 
brutal,” Walton said. “We’ve been practicing turning the outfielders around in funny positions in prac-tice some days and throwing balls 
straight into the sun and saying 
to them, ‘Listen, you gotta find a 
way to find the ball because at the 
College World Series this is how it is.’”
The Gators will get their first 
opportunity to put this experience 
to use today in what will likely be 
a slugfest against the Bruins. 
Both schools are offensive pow-
erhouses, as Florida ranks third in the NCAA in team batting aver-
age at .335 while UCLA is fourth 
at .333.  
In addition, each school has 
shown it can also hit for power, as 
Florida ranks third in the nation 
with 1.88 home runs per game and UCLA is fifth with 1.68 per con-test. 
Without question, UCLA’s big-
gest threat is senior Megan Lan-genfeld, who was a finalist for the USA Softball National Collegiate Player of the Year Award. 
At the plate, Langenfled is sec-
ond in the nation with a 1.018 slug-ging percentage, and she is 11-1 with a 1.25 ERA when she pitches. 
The Gators are no strangers to 
big-time hitters, as they will have faced five of the nation’s top six in 
batting average after their match-
up with Langenfeld (.500). 
To this point in the season, they 
have held Georgia Tech’s Jen Yee 
(.568), Mississippi State’s Chelsea 
Bramlett (.536), Alabama’s Kayla 
Braud (.505) and Tennessee’s Ra-
ven Chavanne (.482) to a combined 
.458 average.

When Ike Hilliard was pulling down 10 
touchdown receptions and 900 receiving 
yards as a junior on Florida’s 1996 Nation-
al Championship football team, the former All-American never thought he would one day be coaching.
But now, after retiring from the NFL 
in early 2009, Hilliard finds himself doing just that.
After serving as a volunteer coach for 
the United Football League’s Florida Tusk-ers during their inaugural season last year, 
Hilliard was hired last week as the team’s 
new wide receivers coach under first-year head coach Jay Gruden.
It wasn’t until his fourth year in the 
NFL that Hilliard realized he wanted to 
one day coach.
During the 2000 season, while Hilliard 
was starting for the New York Giants, his 
offensive coordinator was current New 
Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton. 
Under Payton’s scheme, the Giants made it to Super Bowl XXXV.
“Just his attention to detail and the way 
we attacked defenses on a weekly basis drew me closer and closer to wanting to 
become a coach,” Hilliard said.
Payton may have prompted Hilliard’s 
interest in the world of 
coaching, but he was hardly the only one to 
influence his ultimate ca-
reer path.
Four years after Pay-
ton’s offensive genius 
sparked Hilliard’s inter-
est, the former UF wide 
receiver found himself playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he was coached by Jon Gruden, who Hilliard  de-scribed as a “great motivator” and “unbe-
lievable teacher.”
“(Getting into coaching) was a no-
brainer for me after trying to do my best to 
soak up all that knowledge and experience from those two,” Hilliard said.
While Hilliard points to Payton and Jon 
as the catalysts for his desire to coach, he credits nearly every coach he’s come across in his football career for influencing him.
And though he had no aspirations of 
becoming a coach during his three seasons playing for the Gators – during which he UFL’s Florida Tuskers hire former Gator as WR coach

Kevin Chapman hasn’t re-
ceived this much attention since 
high school.
The burly left-hander was a 
Louisville Slugger All-American at Westminster Academy where he recorded a 0.89 ERA in his ju-nior year. In his senior season he was limited due to injury on his way to being drafted by the De-troit Tigers in the 42nd round of the MLB Draft before even step-ping foot onto a college campus.
Since arriving at UF, the south-
paw struggled to carve out a role on the team in his first three years – until now.
He opened this season as a 
middle reliever and ended it on the All-Southeastern Conference team as a closer.
Chapman has played a key role 
in a Gators bullpen that has been the catalyst to the team’s 36-0 re-cord when leading after the sixth inning. It will look to continue that streak tonight at 7. when No. 4 Florida (42-15) begins regional play against Bethune-Cookman (35-20) in McKethan Stadium.
“Even from high school, he 
was always a guy that scouts coveted,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “It’s not like he has come out of nowhere. It was just a mat-ter of time — when is he going 
to start reaching his potential? – and I think now he is starting to do that.”
After receiving a medical red-
shirt because of Tommy John sur-gery in what would have been his sophomore season and splitting time on the mound as a starter and reliever in his other two sea-sons at Florida, nobody knew what to expect from Chapman in his junior year.
“He really wasn’t on the map. 
He was just an X-factor,” Baseball America’s Aaron Fitt said. “You wondered what you were going to get out of that guy. I didn’t ex-pect him to be a key part of this team.”
Now, Chapman isn’t only an 
integral part of the squad, he owns the second-most saves in the SEC and boasts a minuscule 
1.31 ERA. 
For the first time since his 
memorable junior season at 
Westminster Academy, the hard-throwing left-hander is at 100 percent – and it shows.
“I think it’s a combination of 
me being fully healthy and hav-ing three other years under my 
belt,” Chapman said. “I think 
that’s really helped me.”
Wear and Tear
It has been a while since Chap-
man’s arm has felt this strong – 2005, to be exact.
The domino effect that led to 
Tommy John surgery began in 
his senior year of high school. 
Tendinitis in his throwing el-
bow limited him during his last 
season at Westminster Academy. It was a year that was supposed to start his rise to the next level – Chapman earned preseason Louisville Slugger All-America honors – but instead it began a 
nightmarish series of events.
“(The tendinitis) was like a 
discomfort thing, and it probably 
made me change my mechanics a little bit,” he said. “Over time, with wear and tear, it probably made my ligament break.”
In other words, the minor el-
bow injury led to Tommy John 
surgery. After a mediocre fresh-
man campaign at Florida, Chap-man underwent the serious pro-cedure for an ulnar collateral ligament (elbow) tear in March 2008.
After rehabbing from the first 
surgery, he was forced go under the knife a second time in Sep-
tember 2008 to remove a bone 
chip in his left elbow. He sat out that entire season and received a medical redshirt. 
But his return the next season 
wasn’t everything he expected. 
Despite only taking the mound in 11 games, the numbers were there. Chapman put up a 2.38 ERA, but he knew his arm still 
wasn’t at full strength. For a hurl-
er that normally hits 94 mph on the radar gun, he was topping off at 90 mph a year removed from the surgeries.
“I was definitely healthy 
as far as my arm,” he said. “It just wasn’t back to 100 percent strength. I had to build up some 
muscle and some arm strength.”
The lack of velocity, the inju-
ries and a string of inconsistent 
performances since joining the Gators left everybody with low expectations for the pitcher.
However, Chapman finally 
fulfilled his potential this season, and he will likely reap the ben-
efits in this year’s MLB Draft.
“He’s been chomping at the 
bit,” O’Sullivan said. “He’s been 
wanting to go since last year. He was healthy, but he just didn’t have as many innings under his belt as he needed to. We started seeing flashes last year.”
Ready for Next Level
Pitch velocity is not the only 
thing that has risen this season for the Coral Springs native.
The junior’s draft stock has 
skyrocketed. Chapman, who will 
be eligible for June’s MLB Draft, 
could be the first college closer selected and is the top 2010 draft prospect on Florida’s roster.
According to Fitt, who has 
talked to numerous MLB scouts, he could be selected at the back end of the first round.
“A three-pitch lefty with that 
kind of velocity (mid-90s) who has put up the numbers that he has put up,” Fitt said, “he is go-ing to appeal to scouts who are numbers-oriented, but also scouts that are tools-oriented because his tools are ridiculous.”
Although Chapman estimates 
he uses his overpowering fastball 
90 percent of the time, his sharp 
slider and deceiving changeup are what make him so attractive to professional scouts. 
The only thing working 
against the lefty is his history of elbow injuries.
But he has put some of those 
doubts to rest this season after 
appearing in 28 games, the most 
out of any Gators pitcher this year. 
“They definitely have a right 
to be worried about it – (Tommy John is) a major surgery,” Chap-man said. “But this season I’ve been able to throw no problem – I’ve thrown back-to-back days. 
I feel like I just have shown that 
my arm is back to 100 percent.”
Fitt said it didn’t take long 
for scouts to gravitate toward the closer this season. Once they heard reports that his velocity was back, they were all talking about him, he said.He is projected to stay in the 
bullpen once he makes the jump 
to the next level, but his history 
as a starter – he has logged seven starts at UF – gives him the versa-tility to do both.
“I think at this point he has 
found a niche in the bullpen,” Fitt said. “He succeeds there. He has the right mentality for it. Your stuff plays up when you are in 
the pen, and that’s what he has 
been able to do. So I think that is where he will stay in pro ball.”
All at the Right Time
It is not often that a player 
puts together an All-SEC season in the same year he is going to be eligible for the draft and Chap-man doesn’t have to look far 
from his own clubhouse to find 
proof of that.
UF center fielder Matt den 
Dekker, Chapman’s cousin, struggled in his junior year and hit just .296 before posting a .355 batting average this season. He attributed the down year to the pressure that came along with 
impressing scouts.
But that hasn’t been a problem 
for Chapman, who has posted his 
best numbers in his draft season.
“He’s just been healthy,” den 
Dekker said. “He battled some injuries. He has always had a good arm and he’s doing a great job this year for us.”
This season, he has put it all 
together. He has struck out 40 batters in 41.1 innings of work, compared to just seven walks. 
However, the three-year span 
full of elbow issues and uncer-tainty not only affected Chapman then — it is still with him now. 
“They always say, ‘You never 
really know what you have until you lose it.’ I lost it there for a little bit,” Chapman said. “It re-ally helped me realize how fun this game is and how much I’m blessed.”Closing Time

Former UF wide receiver Ike Hilliard was named the new wide recievers coach for the Florida 
Tuskers. He played 12 seasons in the NFL before retiring in 2009.  
Hilliard caught 29 TDs as a Gator
amassed 2,214 receiving yards and 29 
touchdown receptions – Hilliard said he was fortunate to play for a great 
position coach in current Ohio Bobcats 
wide receivers coach Dwayne Dixon, 
who he said doesn’t get enough credit 
for the work he does with young re-ceivers. 
“That’s where it all really started,” 
Hilliard said. “It’s a shame I was so 
young that I didn’t soak up enough to really, fully understand and grasp ev-erything he was teaching me.”
During the 2008 NFL season, Hill-
iard was knocked unconscious in a Sunday Night Football game that ef-fectively ended his playing career. Even though he had hopes of being 
able to return to the game he loves, 
neck injuries prevented him from do-ing so. 
A relationship he built with Jay 
during his time with the Buccaneers cleared a path for Hilliard’s career in the coaching ranks.
After he placed a call to Jay to ask 
him and former Tuskers head coach 
Jim Haslett if he could “stick his head 
around” practice, the two asked Hill-iard to become a volunteer coach last season.
When Jay was recently promoted 
after Haslett was named the defensive coordinator for the Washington Red-skins, he offered Hilliard the position of wide receivers coach.
The Tuskers roster isn’t completely 
filled yet, but Hilliard is looking for-
ward to August 16, when the team gets 
to begin training camp, and he gets to officially begin his first season  among the coaching ranks.
“I don’t want to disrespect the 
craft,” Hilliard said. “I’ve been study-ing my butt off, trying to learn as much as I can about the game of foot-ball from the other side, because be-
ing a player and being a coach are two 
completely different animals.”UFL , from page 18UF GOLF

A school from Florida is atop the 
NCAA Championship leaderboard 
– but it isn’t the Gators.
They  finished the second round 
of the NCAA Championship on Wednesday in Chattanooga, Tenn., sitting in fifth place.
No. 6 Florida finished the day at 
289, (+1), 14 strokes behind tourna-ment leader and rival No. 19 Florida State.
“As a team, we played fairly 
well,” UF senior Tim McKenney said. “Andres Echavarria was the low guy, he shot a two under, and the rest of us were right around par. We didn’t play great, we didn’t play awful, we played well enough to still be in it.”
On the first day of the NCAA 
Championship, the Gators finished tied for seventh at 287, (-1) and were led by freshman Phillip Choi. Choi was playing in his first NCAA 
Championship and carded a 69, (-3) 
in the first round, finishing in a tie 
for third place. 
“The national championship 
doesn’t know whether you’re a se-
nior or a freshman,” McKenney said. 
“I think he treated it like any other 
round and he played really well. He’s played in many big events out-side of college, so I’m sure this was nothing new to him.”
When the Gators came out to 
play Wednesday, some of the teams 
older players received a little moti-
vation going into 
the second round, 
as four Gators were named to 
the PING All-Re-
gion Team.
Seniors McK-
enney and Tyson 
Alexander made 
the team for the second year in a 
row, and it was a first-time honor for 
juniors Echavarria and Bank Vong-vanij.“It shows I had a pretty good 
year,” McKenney said. “The award takes a look at the whole year as op-posed to just one tournament. If I 
play well in this tournament maybe 
All-American may be next.”
The Gators were confident going 
into Wednesday, but continued a 
trend of posting lackluster second-
round scores, forcing them to fight 
back in the third round. 
The Gators have struggled on 
par-4 holes. Out of the team’s 21  bo-
geys, 16 of them were on par-4 holes. 
Also of the 10 total team bogeys 
Wednesday, eight of them were on 
par-4 holes.
“They are very important,” McKenney said. “Par-4 holes are what you play the most rather than a par-5 or a par-3. One thing that’s really important on these par-4 holes 
is getting the ball on the fairway off 
the tee. Especially out here because 
the rough is very difficult. So I think if we hit the ball well off the tee then we should have a better opportu-
nity attacking the holes (in the third 
round).”
Going into today’s round the 
Gators remain poised and positive.
“The expectation (today) is to 
play well enough to get into the top eight, and have a chance to win the 
national championship” McKenney said.

“Just his attention to detail and 
the way we attacked defenses 
on a weekly basis drew me 
closer and closer to wanting to 
become a coach.”
