  In the third impeachment trial in UF Student Government 
history, the Senate voted Tuesday night not to impeach Su-
pervisor of Elections Toni Megna.
  Five Students Party senators drafted a resolution to im-
peach Megna on 13 elections codes they said she did not fol-low.
  Senators voted that Megna did not carry out eight of the 
13 elections rules in question, but each infraction failed to re-ceive enough impeachment votes from senators.
  Spring senators voted on the accuracy of each presented 
infraction. If two-thirds of the senators voted that an infrac-
tion was true, they then voted on whether that warranted 
impeachment. Impeachment also needed a two-thirds vote 
to pass.
  Senator Gillian Leytham, the Students Party leader, was 
the only senator who voted that each of the eight approved infractions individually merited Megna’s impeachment.
  Student Senate President Andy Mason did not vote.
After the fall elections, Students Party members, includ-
ing Leytham, appealed the results to the Election Commis-sion and then the UF Supreme Court. They said computer error and Megna’s incorrect elections procedures required an 
elections redo.

� THE NEW RESTAURANT WILL BE 
LOCATED IN BUTLER PLAZA.

  The national Tex-Mex chain Tijuana Flats 
will be opening its second Gainesville eatery in early 2012. The new restaurant will be located in Butler Plaza on Archer Road. 
  The other Gainesville location is on West 
University Avenue.  
  The Tijuana Flats marketing department said 
the restaurant has seen success in Gainesville with its ﬁ  rst location and wanted to provide another location to service the rest of the city.   
  Suniti Patel, an 18-year-old freshman at 
Santa Fe College, is excited about the new loca-tion.   “I love Mexican food, and I love the atmo-
sphere while eating there,” she said. 
  Patel, who lives at The Enclave Apartments 
on Southwest 35th Place, said she believes the new restaurant’s location will be more conve-
nient.
  “It’s easier to ﬁ  nd parking [on Archer], too,” 
she said.
  Adam DeBosier, a 20-year-old engineering 
sophomore at UF, said he is also looking for-
ward to the Butler Plaza location’s opening. 
  “Tijuana Flats is more authentic Mexican 
food than most other places, and their hot sauc-es are awesome,” he said. 
  DeBosier said he’ll be glad to have a closer 
place to eat.
  “It’s like a three minute car ride to the new 
location. I could even walk,” he said. “The old location is in a congested area. Trafﬁ  c is bad on the way there, and it’s hard to park.” Tijuana Flats to open new locationRESEARCH

  Instead of climbing rock walls or 
running obstacle courses, partici-
pants in the Technology Entrepre-
neur BootCamp gathered Tuesday evening to hear business tips and learn how to pitch their products to 
investors.
  The event, organized by the Of-
fice of Technology Licensing and 
UF Tech Connect, is the first of its kind at the Innovation Hub. 
  Technology Entrepreneur Boot-
Camp will continue all day today and Thursday.
  About 30 people attended Tues-day’s meeting, including a handful of UF undergraduate students. 
  A majority of the boot camp par-
ticipants came only with ideas, but a few had start-up companies al-ready up and running.
  The program is designed to give 
entrepreneurs the tools to create and run their own technology start-ups, said Jane Muir, associate di-rector of the Office of Technology 
Licensing.
BootCamp participants were 
required to apply and be accepted 
prior to the event.

Eight UF students took the first and second place spots at the 2011 Phi Alpha Delta 
Pre-Law Conference and Mock Trial Competition in Alexandria, Va., last week.
� THEY COMPETED AGAINST 12 OTHER 
TEAMS AT THE CONFERENCE.

Eight UF students took home the first and 
second place spots at a national mock trial com-
petition in Alexandria, Va., last week.
The 2011 Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Confer -
ence and Mock Trial Competition was held 
Wednesday through Saturday. It required par -
ticipants to analyze and present a case to a panel 
of practicing attorneys and Washington, D.C.-area judges.
Criminology senior Brandon Breslow, 21, said 
UF’s case was interesting because it was given 
the opportunity to challenge whether a person 
with Asperger’s syndrome, a developmental disorder, was aware of committing a crime. 
“The trial was perfect,” said Christina Ertel, 
vice president of the organization and the mock trial coach. “Everyone was on their game, their 
arguments were right on point, and they were able to read the judge and respond to objections very articulately.”
Fourteen teams participated in the mock tri-
al portion of the conference, including the two from UF.
UF also won awards for Best Prosecution 
Team, Best Defense Team and Best Witness.
“We took home every award that was allo-
cated to the mock trial competition,” said Ertel, a 21-year-old political science senior.
Criminology junior Mallory Cooney, 20, said 
she never thought she’d be ready to compete af-ter one semester of training. 
“But we have such a great program that I 
really had a good foundation,” Cooney said.UF mock trial teams take top

Student Senate President Andy 
Mason has announced the 11 
members of the specialized com-
mittee that will be tasked with 
revising the UF Student Govern-ment elections codes.
Mason said he determined mi-
nority party and independent sen-ators composed about one-tenth of Senate and applied that ratio to the committee.
The committee, formed by the 
Senate president, will recommend changes to the elections proce-dures in light of the complications with the electronic voting system 
during the fall elections. 
For changes to apply to Spring 
elections, they must be approved 
five weeks in advance. 
Unite Party Sen. Matt Mount-joy, one of the committee mem-bers, said he hoped to come up 
with proposed 
revisions by Winter Break.
Unite Party 
Sen. Katie Wald-
man, also a com-
mittee member, said members will consider 
how other schools run their elec-tions and possibly look at a sys-tem different from the secure-location electronic voting system 
used this fall. 
“I think we’re going to look 
at the whole system from the top 
down,” she said.
Students Party Sens. Carly Wil-
son and Douglas Whitaker, who are not members of the commit-tee, voiced concerns that no grad-uate students were appointed to the body.
“I didn’t view that as relevant 
to the committee,” Mason said in 
response.
Anyone can attend the commit-
tee meetings, but only committee 
members can vote on changes.
Students who want to voice 
their ideas about the elections system can email Mountjoy at mmountjoy@ufl.edu or Waldman at krwaldman@ufl.edu.

UF Hillel has expanded Israel 
Week into Israel Month this year 
in hopes of giving students more opportunity to participate.
UF Hillel program director Jeff 
Kaplan said the goal is to expose students to a different culture they may not know much about throughout the entire month of November.
Compared with past years, this 
year’s events are more concentrat-ed on educational activities.
“We have events that are 
grounded on what’s happening in Israel,” he said.
Israel Week served as a comple-
ment in the Fall semester to Jewish Awareness Month in March, said Josh Kahn, 27, an Israel Fellow at UF Hillel. 
During the entire month, Hil-
lel will be collecting 1,491 Post-it Notes from students who write about something they have done related to Israel in the past five years.
The Post-it Notes will form a 
large Israeli flag to be showcased on campus to celebrate the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was captured by Hamas militants in 2006 and finally released Oct. 18, Kahn said.
Students are also invited to cel-
ebrate Shalit’s release at the Grog House Bar & Grill on Thursday.
Mitzvah Day for Israel will be 
held Sunday, where participants can sign up to volunteer at hospi-tals in Israel.
On Nov. 28, the Hillel will host 
a screening of the award-winning film “Ajami.” 
Afterward, audience members 
can enjoy dinner and hookah un-der traditional Bedouin tents.
“With more events, the Hil-
lel can reach out to students who want to further their relationship with Israel on a different level,” Kahn said. 
Kahn, who moved to Israel in 
2003, returned in 2010 to serve with UF Hillel. He returns to Is-rael in May.
“Having an Israel Week really 
limits what you can do,” he said. “Now students have the option to come to different programs.”
Kahn said Israel Month is 
about appreciating the beauty of 
the country.
“Israel Month is not just for 
Jewish students,” Kahn said. “Is-
rael is more than what you just see 
on CNN.”UF Hillel hosts month of educational events focused on Israel

More than a year after the 10 per -
cent tax on indoor tanning bills was 
implemented, the IRS has reported it has come up short on the expected money made from the tax.
Originally projected to bring in 
$200 million for 2011, the tax gener -
ated $36.6 million for the first half of the year, according to an October report from J. Russell George, the treasury inspector general for tax administration.
George said the IRS estimated in 
2010 that about 250,000 businesses 
would be subject to the tax, but only 
about 10,300 have filed the required forms.
Ed Ruzakowski, owner of Tan 
USA in Butler Plaza, said he thinks the tax is “incredibly unfair,” and he is not surprised by these results.
The tanning industry is relatively 
small, he said, and as the economy 
worsened, increasing numbers of 
salons closed throughout the coun-try.
“The tax was just another nail in 
the coffin,” he said.
Tan USA’s basic monthly plan, 
originally $25, is now $27.50, an in-crease that didn’t sit well with cus-tomers.
The salon has seen about a 20 
percent decrease in customers since the tax’s implementation, Ruza-kowski said. 
With winter around the corner, 
he said he expects to see a slight increase in customers for Novem-ber and December but the biggest months are January through March.
Businesses that offer tanning as 
an auxiliary service, like gyms or apartment complexes, are not re-quired to pay the tax.
Lauren Knight, a 19-year-old 
psychology freshman, said she was shocked by the number of Gainesville apartment complexes that offer free tanning as an ame-nity. 
Knight said she doesn’t go to 
indoor tanning beds because she’s concerned about the risks of skin cancer, but she equates the tanning tax with taxes on cigarettes.
“I agree with the ‘tax the vices’ 
mentality,” she said.
If she were to visit a tanning sa-
lon, a price increase of a couple dol-lars wouldn’t deter her, she said, unless she were really strapped for cash. 
But Knight said she might choose 
to go to an apartment complex’s tanning bed just to save the money altogether.Tan tax fails to bring

U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns wants 
equal treatment for all workers, 
regardless of ability.
But according to the U.S. De-
partment of Labor, employers 
can legally pay disabled workers 
less than the minimum wage.
Last month, Stearns, R-Fla., 
and U.S. Rep. Tim Bishop, D-N.Y., presented a bill that would eliminate the part of the Fair Labor Standards Act that al-lows employers to pay disabled workers less than minimum 
wage. 
The Fair Wages for Work-
ers with Disabilities Act of 2011 
would require employers to pay disabled workers at least the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 per hour. 
Minimum wage for disabled 
workers would be instituted in the private sector within one year of the bill’s passage. 
Public or governmental 
agencies would be required to pay minimum wage within two years and nonprofit groups to pay within three years. 
“As we wind down two wars, 
thousands of our brave men and 
women are returning home with 
disabilities,” Stearns wrote in an email. “We owe them, and all of the disabled, the opportunity to fully participate in our society and in the workplace.”The Americans with Dis-
abilities Act prohibits hiring discrimination toward people with physical or cognitive dis-
abilities.
However, The Fair Labor 
Standards Act states that “indi-
viduals whose earning or pro-ductive capacities for the work to be performed are impaired by physical or mental disabilities, including those related to age or injury,” may be paid below 
the minimum wage, according 
to the Department of Labor’s website.
“We don’t do that,” said 
Dane Dodd, 
corporate na-tional trainer for Contem-porary Ser -
vices Corp., a security and crowd man-agement com-pany. 
UF uses Contemporary Ser -
vices workers for Gator Growl, football games and other sport-ing events. 
Dodd said people with mo-
bility and cognitive disabilities make up a larger part of the company’s workers than other companies’, probably more than the average.  
To work for Contemporary 
Services, hires must be 18 years or older, have a high school di-
ploma or equivalent and com-plete a training program that 
requires reading and under -
standing English. 
Employees are paid based on 
the type of job they do, Dodd said, but no employee is ever paid below the state minimum wage.
“We don’t really view dis-
abilities as an issue,” he said. “It’s just who you are.” 
Although the company 
doesn’t specifically recruit any 
particular groups, in the past 
the company has worked with the Wounded Warrior Project, which helps wounded service members transition back into civilian life.
Dodd said most of the dis-
abled workers hired by the com-pany come looking for work on 
their own, but some of them find 
the company through work-placement programs or commu-nity representatives.
Trish Ward, co-owner and 
front end manager of Ward’s Supermarket, said she’s had two cognitively disabled men working at her store for about 
five years. 
They came separately look-
ing for work and were hired as 
grocery baggers.
“I’ve never paid them any 
differently than anyone else,” Ward said. 
They can do the work, she 
said, so why treat them any 
less?Federal legislators push to pay 
disabled workers minimum wage

dent Senate President Andy 
Mason read her statement. She 
said the impeachment was an 
“unreasonable request” and 
that some of the allegations 
against her were factually in-
correct.
Megna did not return re-
quests for comment after the 
hearing.
Before the votes, some of the 
resolution’s authors addressed the Senate. 
Leytham said the impeach-
ment body was voting on the 
accuracy of the facts of the rules 
infractions.
Several senators said Megna 
is a student with other respon-
sibilities.
“We are all students, first 
and foremost,” said Sen. Katie Waldman, who was recently 
chosen as the co-chair of a com-
mittee that will revise the elec-
tions codes.
Waldman also said the Sen-ate failed to update elections codes to reflect the new voting system.
Throughout the voting, 
Leytham said senators who 
voted that an infraction did oc-
cur but did not count nonfea-
sance as a cause for impeach-ment contradicted themselves. 
According to the definitions 
on the impeachment agenda, nonfeasance is “the non-perfor -
mance of some act which ought 
to be performed.”
Leytham said she thought 
the process was ridiculous.
“It defies logic,” she said. 
“It’s like saying, ‘Yes, you lied 
under oath, but no, that doesn’t mean you committed perju-
ry.’”veloping a technology product,

Participants’ entrepreneurial 
ideas ranged from Internet plat-
forms where students can buy 
and sell class notes to genetical-
ly modified food products and sound-engineering technology. 
Brian Johnson, a self-pro-
claimed “start-up evangelist” 
from Microsoft Corp., quoted 
Pablo Picasso and Steve Jobs in his presentation about markets. 
He emphasized monetizing 
entrepreneurs’ ideas.
“You need to be able to fund 
that dream of changing the world with your product,” he said.
In addition to lectures by 
successful business leaders, the BootCamp throughout the next couple of days will include inter -
active modules geared toward 
helping participants develop an 
“elevator pitch” — a pitch so ef-fective, it could get someone in-terested in a concept in as little time as an elevator ride.
“As simple as that sounds, 
it can be very difficult,” Muir said. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

Spanish freshman Keegan Storrs wanted to make his first 
college schedule an interesting one.
Registering for fall classes, he saw a zombie apocalypse 
class in the online course listing.
“My first reaction was disbelief,” he said. 
With UF spring registration under way, students like Storrs 
are registering for some unusual classes outside of their ma-jors.
Biology with Fireflies, Artificial Intelligence in Computer 
Games and a reading program called “To Hell and Back,” based on Dante’s “Inferno,” are some out-of-the-ordinary courses being offered at UF in the spring. 
Michael Gorham, associate professor of Russian studies, 
was the instructor for Russian Fairy Tales, a course offered in Fall 2011. Gorham said courses that seem unusual at first glance can become valuable learning experiences for stu-dents.
“Regardless of the title, the course has to deliver,” he said.
Gorham said courses like Russian Fairy Tales are in de-
mand because they appeal to a variety of 
students.
Storrs, 18, said he wanted to take Biol-
ogy with Fireflies but couldn’t because the 
class filled up before he could register.
“A lot of people really like these class-
es,” he said. “You have to be quick if you 
want them.”
Some of these courses are intended for 
specific majors such as computer science, said Douglas D. Dankel II, assistant professor in computer and information science and engineering. In Artificial Intelligence in Com-puter Games, students learn to present and design an idea for their own computer games.
“It broadens their general knowledge,” he said. “They’re 
also building some presentation skills at the same time,” he 
said.
Storrs said classes that focus on a specific topic allow him 
to learn and apply new skills that he can remember for a lon-
ger period of time.
“You’re having fun while you’re learning,” he said. 
“There’s a lot more that gets stored for a longer period of time in your head.”

Working students have more on their 
minds than turkey and presents as the holi-
day season approaches.
Some students will have to stay in 
Gainesville to work during the holidays.
Paul Cipollone, a 20-year-old marketing 
junior at UF, has been clocking in more than 30 hours a week as a sales representative at V erizon Wireless at The Oaks Mall for more than a year.
Cipollone, who is currently a part-time 
student, is staying in Gainesville until af-ter Christmas, working full-time, 40-hour weeks beginning in December.
American Eagle Outfitters is hiring store 
associates for the holidays, according to the company’s Facebook page.
Other retailers, including Build-a-Bear 
Workshop, Yankee Candle and Lynn’s Hall-
mark Shop at The Oaks Mall, have already 
hired seasonal help.
Leslie Cleaver, a 20-year-old biological 
engineering junior at UF, has been work-ing as a lifeguard at North County Aquatic Complex in her hometown of Jupiter for five years.
Though she is a full-time student, she 
has continued to work there during winter 
and summer breaks to pay for her expenses 
while at school.
“I like my job,” she said. “There are a lot 
of college-aged kids that work there, so it makes it a fun experience.”‘Tis the season for part-time work

UF Army ROTC and Navy ROTC will 
compete Thursday to determine which 
branch is better — at flag football, that is.
The second-annual Army ROTC vs. 
Navy ROTC Flag Football Game is from 2 
p.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday at the Southwest 
Recreational Center Fields.
The two rival branches will compete for 
bragging rights, said Army Cadet Joshua Denison, a 21-year-old family, youth and community sciences junior who is helping organize the event.
“There will be a lot of cheering, a lot 
of noise and probably a lot of arguing,” 
Denison said.
ROTC members also want to show the 
UF community that they are more than se-
rious faces and uniforms. 
“Although we are serious, we’re also okay to talk to,” Denison said. “We’re stu-dents just like you; We’re just doing some -
thing a little different after we graduate.” 
The game will be the UF version of 
the traditional Army-Navy football game between the U.S. Military Academy and the U.S. Naval Academy, which will take place Dec. 10 at 2:30 p.m.
The rivalry between the two branches 
dates back to the first-ever Army-Navy football game in 1890.
Despite the rivalry, Denison thinks of 
all ROTC branches like a brotherhood.
“We’re a bit of a fraternity coming to-
gether for a greater good,” he said. Army, Navy face off in football

It’s a violation of rights 
to mandate motto
On July 30, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed 
a resolution declaring the phrase “In God We Trust” the 
official motto of the U.S. 
The motto also first appeared on U.S. currency in 1864. The 
phrase has a lot of meaning for the U.S., but it also has been the 
subject of controversy . 
Critics of the motto argue that it violates the establishment 
clause of the First Amendment and view it as respecting only 
monotheistic religions. 
Some supporters claim that the country was founded on Ju-
deo-Christian principles or at least with some respect to a higher power, making the motto symbolic of our heritage. For instance, 
the Declaration of Independence says that people are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.” 
Others make nothing of the motto, claiming that it has lost 
almost all religious meaning through mere repetition. 
Regardless of where you fall on the argument, most agree 
that the government should not force anyone to recite or adhere to this motto. 
Well, unless you drive up I-75 North to Atlanta. 
State Senator Bill Heath, R-Bremen, proposed legislation for 
the upcoming session, which would require that all Georgia li-
cense plates bear the phrase “In God We Trust.” 
Previously, motorists could pay $1 for a sticker to put on their 
plate to display the phrase. 
Heath believes that people shouldn’t have to go through all 
of that trouble to show their love of faith and country . He wants 
to make the motto the default phrase on new license plates, start-ing July 1 of next year. 
Those who would not like the motto on their license plate can 
pay a fee (probably $1) to get a county sticker to cover it. 
The fact that motorists have to pay a fee is not the problem. 
It would not matter if the fee was one cent or one dollar; people 
should not have to pay extra to refrain from putting a religious 
symbol on their car. 
Many non-religious people or polytheists (those who believe 
in multiple gods) may not care either way about the change, but those who believe in individual liberty should view this propos-
al with scrutiny . 
If Georgia wants to allow people to show pride in their coun-
try or in their faith, it should give people the ability to choose 
among a few license plates without an extra fee. 
The bigger question here is what are these legislators trying 
to accomplish? Do they think that by somehow putting the mot-to on the back of everyone’s car, it will somehow create a revival of religious sentiment throughout the state? 
Or are they trying to look like the pro-religion candidate for 
the 2012 election? 
Shoving a motto down someone’s throat won’t make him or 
her more religious. Let’s hope that Georgia voters take the side of religious freedom in the next election.Guest column
Free market health care not a bad thing
Why is health care so dang expensive? It concerns 
me to see that the default solution to any prob-lem is more government regulation. Congress 
seems to love passing more laws, but it never thinks that maybe its mountains of legislation are the source of the problem. 
Health care has been riddled with more and more gov-
ernment intervention since the 1960s, and it’s no mistake that costs have skyrocketed since President Johnson intro-duced Medicare and Medicaid. 
The U.S. now pays at least $2,000 more for health care 
per person than any other nation, and the quality isn’t sig-nificantly higher than in Canada or Europe. While many people think capitalism is to blame, I find it strange that the U.S. health care system in the past 50 years has  been anything but free market health care. 
What exactly would free market health care look like? First and foremost, let’s get something out of the way. 
Under a private health care system, those without insur -
ance would not be denied care. It’s not a “Let ‘em die if he can’t pay!” scenario as the media seems to believe. After doing some research, I found that immediate care would be provided in emergency situations at a direct loss to the hospital. This makes sense because no hospital would want to see “Local hospital lets uninsured homeless man die on the floor” on the front of a newspaper, moral impli-cations aside.
I’d like to zero-in on the cost of service. This is the major 
concern because the overall goal is affordable and univer -
sal health care. Generally speaking, I have come to believe that high costs are the result of the state. I’d wager that a lack of competition is probably the biggest reason for the high cost of insurance. There’s simply not much choice when it comes to insurance coverage nowadays. 
Government regulations that require fixed-priced stan-
dard care packages tend to be more expensive than more innovative insurance packages, which could be made in absence of these laws. Regulations that give way for fraudulent medi-cal billing and malpractice, which outlaw price discrimination as well 
as hospital subsidies and antitrust laws, seem to cause in-creased costs on the whole. Not to mention the incurred non-medical bureaucratic and management costs that play a significant role in why health care is so expensive. 
That alone was shocking to me. Maybe private systems 
work better after all, but what about those who still can’t afford it — those without insurance? Specifically regard-ing expensive treatments like kidney dialysis, I found there was historically 1) a shortage of machines which re-sulted in high costs and demand, and 2) people stayed on dialysis for longer than they should have. The free market allows for new and unrestricted innovation in medical technology, which has been at work driving down costs of machines in the long run. 
Free market information systems unabashed by gov-
ernment controls will improve, allowing for more proper diagnosis and treatment. 
In conclusion, I think we’re jumping the gun a bit with 
health care. “Who pays for the uninsured that need help?” is probably the last question we should ask. 
Private insurance companies and hospitals would 
shoulder most of the cost from their profit margins. Fur -
ther, employers, private charities and associations, church-es, individual donations and family contributions would be able to foot the rest of the bill.
Especially given the new affordability of care, custom-
er choice and lower costs of technology, I am now confi-dent that everybody would receive cheaper, high-quality treatment. I think we should give private health care a true shot and remove government as far from the picture as possible. It might just save more lives.

Speaking Out WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 7
As the campers in Harvard Yard are fond of remind-
ing us, the top 1 percent of American households earn 24 percent of the national income. The same 1 percent 
has seen three-fifths of the total income growth from 1979 to 2007. Although these numbers may be disturbing, we should 
keep in mind that the vast majority of Americans, save a small 
percentage, live very comfortably by global standards. Even among the 46 million citizens below the federal poverty line in 2009, less than a fifth reported being hungry at any time during the previous year, and only 4 percent were temporar -
ily homeless. The vast majority of “poor” households had modern amenities including air conditioning, microwaves, cars and cable or satellite TV .
Nevertheless, a non-negligible number of Americans live 
in genuine poverty, and improving middle-class living stan-dards can only be a good thing. The method of helping the “99 percent” that seems to get the most press coverage is a government that acts like Robin Hood, taking from the rich and giving to the poor through redistributive taxation. While a progressive tax code is a valuable tool, it discourages work and risk taking among the most productive citizens. As pro-gressive as the federal tax code already is and as slowly as the economy is growing, any quest to raise living standards 
across the board should begin with reforms that are less likely 
to deter economic growth.
Before making the top 1 percent pay even more than the 
38 percent of federal individual income tax revenues that they already contribute, the government could start by eliminating or reform-ing programs that redistribute from the poor to the rich. Take public lotter -
ies, which state governments operate as monopolies, to raise 
additional revenue. Thanks in part to advertising in low-in-
come areas, the poor spend a much greater proportion of their income playing the lottery than the rich, and some evidence suggests they actually spend more as a dollar amount. Rather than encouraging the poor to waste their hard-earned money playing the lottery, states should raise revenue through equi-table channels and create incentives for the poor to save.
A more significant deterrent to saving by the poor is Social 
Security, which will need to be reformed in the coming years 
to ensure long-term solvency. Despite its progressive benefit 
schedule, Social Security taxes low-income citizens most heav-ily relative to the benefits they receive. Since poorer citizens tend to start working earlier and die at a younger age than the wealthy, they spend more years paying taxes and fewer years collecting retiree benefits. Rather than raising taxes or the retirement age, Congress can correct this imbalance and improve the program’s solvency by simply cutting benefits for the wealthy.
The most obvious way to help the 99 percent is by im-
proving their earning potential, which might include enhanc-ing the physical health of the 16 percent of Americans who lack health insurance. While the constitutionality and fiscal sustainability of last year’s Affordable Care Act remain an open question, the law stands a good chance of helping more Americans become gainfully employed. Another possibility is to narrow the socioeconomic achievement gap in primary and secondary education, which remains stubbornly large 10 
years after the No Child Left Behind Act. The law has had 
modest success in boosting test scores, but more stringent standards for failing schools as well as mandatory remedial instruction for under-performing students could accelerate achievement growth, particularly for low-income students.
In addition to human capital, the 99 percent would benefit 
from more investment in physical capital, which requires an increase in the saving rate. While national saving has recov-ered since the current economic downturn began, it reached 
1 percent of gross national income in 2004, the lowest level in 
50 years. The first step in raising national saving is reining in the federal budget deficit, though revenue-neutral reforms to certain aspects of the tax code, particularly the capital gains tax, could encourage private saving.
Like redistributive taxation, these ideas would improve 
living standards for the poor and middle class. The difference is that they would not retard economic growth, and improve-ments in human and physical capital are sure to accelerate 
growth. In a lagging economy like this one, any policy that 
counteracts growth should be a last resort.

Redistribution of wealth not the answer for the ‘99 percent’UWire
When most students hear the word Keystone, they immediately think about what they were drinking last 
weekend. They don’t think about the Key-stone XL pipeline.
This pipeline is a $7 billion project from 
TransCanada that would transport an estimat-ed 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Houston every day . The pipeline could produce as many as 20,000 jobs, many of them in the Houston area. Last week, the Obama administration killed the hopes of building this pipeline by delaying the rest of its construction until 2013.
TransCanada has already poured $2 billion 
into the project but has repeatedly come under fire because part of the pipeline will cross the Sand Hills region of Nebraska, an ecologically fragile area that lies above the Ogallala Aqui-fer. About 27 percent of the irrigated land in the U.S. relies on this aquifer for agricultural needs.
The fear that this pipeline could pollute 
this aquifer is understandable, but with the amount of research TransCanada has put into the project, it is highly unlikely this will hap-pen.
On Monday , the company announced 
that it would examine alternate routes for the contested portion of the pipeline — routes 
that would allow them to bypass the Ogallala 
Aquifer.
You would think this would be enough for 
those who oppose the project, but it seems they are more concerned about killing U.S. jobs and ridding the U.S. of a viable source of oil than protecting the aquifer.
“It’s our hope that the delay will kill the 
pipeline,” said Nick Berning, a spokesman for 
Friends of the Earth, a grassroots environmen-
tal group, to the International Business Times. “It’s simply not true that we need this oil.”
This couldn’t be further from the truth. We 
do, in fact, need this oil. In addition to dou-bling the amount of oil sand refined in the U.S., the pipeline could potentially lower oil prices and give the U.S. a necessary alternative to oil produced in the Middle East.
Furthermore, what is the message the 
Obama administration is sending to oil com-panies? The applica-tion for the project was submitted to the U.S. Department of 
State in September of 2008. Why now, after 
three years have passed, is the U.S. govern-
ment making the decision to halt construction of the project?
It is possible that this is simply a political 
move by President Barack Obama. By delay-ing the construction of the project until after 2013, Obama has prevented the pipeline from becoming an election issue. It will enable him to enter the 2012 election with a stable voter 
base.
The Obama administration is sending the 
message to oil companies that the U.S. is not 
a good country in which to do business. Most oil companies are already moving their opera-tions overseas. This pipeline could have been a symbol of our nation’s commitment to the oil industry, an industry that employs and pro-vides benefits to thousands of U.S. citizens.
Canada’s prime minister, Stephen Harper, 
is already considering focusing his nation’s oil resources in another direction — West. Harper talked to reporters Sunday at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leader’s meeting in Hawaii about how the decision to delay con-struction of the pipeline will affect the future 
of Canada’s oil industry.
“This does underscore the necessity of 
Canada making sure that we are able to ac-
cess Asia markets for our energy products,” Harper said.
Alberta Premier Alison Redford echoed 
Harper’s sentiments in the National Post on Monday.
“Reality is, Alberta and Canada will build 
markets, and we will go where there are mar -
kets available to us,” Redford said.
The Obama administration needs to be 
held accountable for its reckless decision to delay the construction of this project.
Hopefully, TransCanada will be able to fin-
ish the project. But if not, we will know where to place the blame.

Cougar at the University of Houston.

� SHE COACHES A CHILD 
REFUGEE SOCCER TEAM.
CLAIRE MILLER 
Alligator Contributing Writer
Luma Mufleh left a priv-
eleged life in Jordan to coach a 
children’s soccer team in Geor -
gia.
She coaches the Fugees, a 
5-year-old nonprofit organiza-tion that brings together child surivors of war from 24 coun-tries around the world.
Mufleh, a key character in 
this year’s Common Reading Program book, Warren St. John’s “Outcasts United,” will talk about her experiences Thursday 
at 7:30 p.m. in the Reitz Union 
Grand Ballroom. 
UF freshmen were expected 
to read the book.
She will talk about how the 
Fugees Family idea came about, her inspirations from the refu-
gee children and the idea for ini-
tiating the soccer team. She has 
since received awards for her 
service, like the Martin Luther 
King Jr. award. 
The book shares the story of 
refugee war children from Libe-
ria, Congo, Sudan and Iraq who 
come to find home in Clarkston, 
Ga. The story tells of their strug-
gles and challenges while trying 
to build a new life.
Ashley Pennington, outreach 
coordinator for the Office of 
Sustainability, said the office 
partnered with the reading pro-
gram because it shows social 
sustainability. 
“Mufleh turns around some-
thing that’s confusing and scary, kind of like a motley crew of kids 
around the world, and brings 
them together around some-
thing fun,” Pennington said.  
“Soccer serves as a cultural bar -
rier that bridges the differences in language and background.”
Telecommunication fresh-
man Arielle Schreier, 18, read “Outcasts United” and enjoyed listening to St. John’s detailed 
account. 
“It was a cool story about 
how the refugee kids and the 
soccer team started off as noth-ing and became something,” 
Schreier said.  “It was a classic 
underdog story.”

Without a cigarette, smokers 
become restless, anxious and irri-
table but also healthier.
On Thursday , the American 
Cancer Society’s 36th Great Amer -
ican Smokeout will encourage smokers to kick their nicotine ad-dictions. 
Designed to encourage smok-
ers to quit on that date, the event is being held in honor of Lung Can-cer Awareness Month. 
UF organizations such as the 
Tobacco-Free Task Force, Area 
Health Education Centers Pro-
gram, GatorWell Health Pro-motion Services and Eta Sigma Gamma will promote the event by tabling on campus.
Last year, 68.8 percent of 
American adult smokers wanted 
to quit and 52.4 percent tried to 
quit. But only 6.2 percent recently succeeded, meaning they quit in the past year and had not smoked for at least six months, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion. The CDC defines a smoker as someone who has had at least 100 
cigarettes in his or her life.
A Healthy Gators survey in 
Spring 2010 found 8 percent of 
students used tobacco in the last 30 days of when the survey was given. But only 2 percent surveyed to smoke on a daily basis, said Jane Emmeree, a GatorWell Health Pro-motions Services specialist.
The survey was done be-
fore UF became a tobacco-free campus July 1, 2010.  
The university does not enforce the policy.
English sophomore Kyle Heu-
ser, 19, doesn’t pay attention to the 
recommendation not to smoke. 
“UF owns the building and land, but not the air,” he said. 
Emmeree said GatorWell 
wouldn’t know how effec-
tive the policy is until the next 
Healthy Gator survey in 2013.  
GatorWell offers a quit program 
and one-on-one counseling with a quit coach, who can help a person assess what triggers him or her to smoke. 
“If [you] combine behavioral 
counseling with quit medication, it more than doubles the chances 
of successfully quitting,” said 
Kathy Nichols, co-chair of the UF Tobacco-Free Task Force and as-sistant director with the UF Area Health Education Centers pro-gram, which offers group counsel-ing for quitting tobacco.

Alachua County may be home to facilities 
on an Environmental Protection Agency watch 
list for releasing chemicals into the air.
Last week, the Center for Public Integrity 
and National Public Radio news published 
an internal EPA watch list of serious or persis-
tent Clean Air Act violators that have not been punished for recent violations. NPR.org and iWatchNews.org also released an interactive map of 17,000 U.S. facilities that may be emit-ting harmful chemicals. 
Eleven Alachua County locations were in-
cluded on the list for potential health risks and given ranks from one to five, with five indicat-
ing the highest hazard level. 
Facilities falling into the level-five category 
include the defunct Moltech Power Systems 
Inc. battery plant, 12801 U.S. Highway 441 North in Alachua, and the Cabot/Koppers Su-perfund site, 200 NW 23rd Ave. in Gainesville. The Gainesville Regional Utilities Deer -
haven Generating Station, 10001 NW 13th St., is in the level-four category.
Randy Barrett, communications director for 
the Center for Public Integrity’s iWatch, said this is the first time this information was made public. He said because the EPA hadn’t been 
properly enforcing the Clean Air Act, a num-
ber of people did not know they were on the map or even why they were on the map.
GRU Supervising Utility Engineer Robert 
Klemans said he does not know what puts Deerhaven in the level-four category but said he thinks any kind of facility that has emissions would be listed on the map.
“Deerhaven is one of the cleanest facilities 
in the country,” he said. “We take environmen-tal compliance very seriously.”
GRU spokeswoman Katie Weitekamp said 
the company has gone above and beyond en-vironmental requirements with the installation of $100 million of state-of-the-art equipment. She said GRU has received zero violation no-
tices in the past year.
Robert Pearce, 59, a Stephen Foster neigh-
borhood resident who is on the Protect Gaines-
ville’s Citizens board, said he has been “fight-ing tooth-and-nail” to eliminate  contamination caused by the Superfund site. 
Pearce said he doesn’t criticize the EPA 
for not taking care of the site’s contamination problem  more quickly . He said Scott Miller, 
the EPA’s remedial Superfund site manager, 
has his hands full.
Of the 1,600 facilities the EPA classi-
fied as “high priority violators,” 300 have been on the list for more than a decade.  
It sometimes takes months or years for state and federal regulators to enforce pollution policies.Alachua County facilities on EPA list of polluters

�UF LOST 81-74 TUESDAY.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
Coach Billy Donovan went 
into Columbus, Ohio, knowing 
his guard-laden Gators would be exposed somewhere on the court. 
He said against good teams 
like Ohio State, it is only expect-ed.
Much like last year’s 18-point 
loss to the No. 3 Buckeyes (2-0) that featured 18 giveaways, it was a bevy of turnovers that deprived the No. 7 Gators (1-1) of a marquee win in the second game of the season.
Florida committed 16 turn-
overs this time around and trailed by as many as 16 points Tuesday during an 81-74 loss to the Buckeyes. 
“Playing on the road versus 
a good offensive team, you can’t do that,” Donovan said. ”The turnovers on the road certainly hurt you. It’s going to be good for our guys to watch the film. I think it is something we can learn from.”
Though the Gators shot 50 
percent from three for the game, Donovan said the number of at-tempts would haunt the team as the turnovers mounted.
“We got off to a real good 
start,” Donovan said. 
“We probably took too many 
threes … and we tried to (shoot) way too early in the posses-sion.” 
Using a spread-out set fea-
turing four players on the pe-rimeter in the first half, Florida  stretched the young backcourt of Mistakes doom Gators against Buckeyes

Florida’s jack of all trades is going to become 
a master of one this offseason. 
Sophomore Trey Burton has taken snaps at 
halfback, fullback, quarterback, tight end and 
wide receiver this year but will settle into one position after the season, offensive coordinator Charlie Weis said.
“We’ll probably play him at fullback and 
play him at halfback,” Weis said. 
So far this season, Burton has 30 carries for 
117 yards and three touchdowns, 17 catches for 145 yards and a touchdown, and he is 3-of-5 
passing for 17 yards. 
“There isn’t one guy that wants to be a jack 
of all trades, master of none,” Weis said. “They 
want to find a home and be the guy where they 
have an opportunity to help the team out how-
ever we see best.”
Evans improving: Ju-
nior safety Josh Evans said 
a preseason hamstring in-
jury was the reason for his sluggish beginning of the year. 
Evans was projected as one of UF’s top safe-
ties coming into 2011, but he started just two 
of Florida’s first six games, recording only 16 
tackles during that span. 
“I kind of started off the season slow,” Evans 
said. “I was dealing with a hamstring toward the end of camp. Tried to keep it kind of quiet. 
It was bothering me pretty much. Now it’s feel-
ing pretty good and I’ve been ready to go.” 
Evans has started each of Florida’s last four 
games and recorded 24 tackles, including a ca-
reer-high 11 Saturday against South Carolina. 
He ranks fifth on the team with 40 stops this 
season.

Hangovers aren’t fun. At all.
Sure, what precedes the hangover itself is a 
blast. But the actual hangover is miserable.
Everyone knows the feeling — especially college stu-
dents. And everyone has their own cure for it.
Some work, some don’t. But people still swear by them 
regardless of their effectiveness.
Since the beginning of October, this Gators football 
season has been one big hangover. Injuries, a 1-5 record, 
a struggling offense, a gassed defense and the same story week in and week out.It has been tough to watch at 
times.
But sure enough, there is a cure 
for this football hangover, and it took the court in Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday night. 
The mediocrity of Will Mus-
champ’s first season, which will 
likely end with the school’s first six-loss campaign since 1987 (well before the majority of the students on campus were even born), will quickly be relieved by what Billy Donovan is putting together just across Gale Lemerand Drive.
Donovan and his No. 7 Gators, despite the 81-74 loss 
to No. 3 Ohio State on Tuesday, are the polar opposite of Muschamp and his unranked group.
Muschamp is a down-South country boy. He never 
plans on living west of Texas or north of Tennessee. He is calculated in what he says and what kind of information 
gets to the public about his program. He is controlling 
about every aspect of the football team.Billy Ball the perfect cure for underwhelming football season

Poll Results
Can Florida reverse last year’s results — a 93-75 
loss to Ohio State — on Tuesday when the No. 8 Gators and No. 3 Buckeyes meet again?72% Yes
28% No
79 total votesMeanwhile, Donovan is a Northerner. 
His New York accent is just as prominent as 
Muschamp’s Southern one. He is also cal-
culated, in his own right. But he’s also a lot 
more open about his team. He’s a salesman, after all.
And he will surely sell this football town 
on his basketball team this year.
Florida’s football players, while strug-
gling on the field, have also struggled to show a semblance of personality this year.
The basketball team? Well, it’s bubbling 
with character, none bigger than sopho-more Patric Young, who not only held his own against Ohio State’s big man, Jared Sullinger, but also finished Tuesday’s game 
with 14 points and 12 rebounds — his sec-
ond career double-double and second in as many games.
But the differences don’t end with just 
the makeup of the teams; it extends to their 
styles of play, too.
This Florida football team is a run-based 
offense. The Gators’ ideal plan is to milk the 
clock and pound the rock with methodical 
drives. That hasn’t exactly been the case this 
season, with the offense limping to a No. 98 national ranking overall (and 66th in rush-ing).
The hardwood Gators, on the other hand, 
are going to be far more exciting to watch, win or lose.
They’ll be pushing the ball up the court, 
pressing the opposing team and bringing back Billy Ball.
Essentially, it will be everything this foot-
ball season hasn’t been.
While the gridiron Gators’ season will be 
over after two more regular-season match-ups and likely a pre-New Year’s Day bowl 
game, Donovan’s boys, regardless of what 
Tuesday’s result against the Buckeyes may indicate, have a chance to advance further than last year’s Elite Eight group did.
So sit back and take in this basketball sea-
son.
It will surely wash the bad taste football 
season has left in your mouth, and undoubt-edly cure that hangover.

Gators center Patric Young notched a double-double with 14 points and 12 
boards in Tuesday’s 81-74 loss to Ohio State on the road in Columbus.
Now comfortable, Reed leads Gators
quarterback and tight end during his freshman 
season, sophomore tight end Jordan Reed has fi-nally found a home as a pass catcher. 
With his five-catch, 62-yard performance 
against South Carolina, he passed senior running back Chris Rainey as Florida’s leader in recep-tions. 
“It feels good to get the ball in my hands and 
try and make some plays,” Reed said. “I got more comfortable playing tight end in the game and more comfortable in my role.”
Reed has 24 catches for 251 yards and a touch-
down this season despite missing two September games with a lower-body injury. 
“Jordan’s arrow has been pointed up for over 
a month now,” Weis said. “Jordan has got a very 
high ceiling that hasn’t even come close to being 
reached yet.”
Reed’s switch from pass thrower to pass catch-
er was not an easy one, as he had to learn blocking and route-running. 
He said the hardest adjustment in making the permanent move has been running after the catch. 
“It’s different than QB, because you see every-
thing in front of you, and when you get the ball re-
ceiving you got your back turned to the defense,” 
Reed said. 
Bostic performing well: Junior linebacker Jon 
Bostic leads UF with 77 tackles and is having a sea-
son coach Will Muschamp called 
“outstanding.”
Bostic has either led the team 
or tied for the team lead in tack-les in six of the Gators’ last eight 
games. His totals in tackles, tack-
les for loss (six) and sacks (three) this season eclipse his combined totals from his first two years at 
UF. 
He credited his improvement to understanding 
opponent tendencies based on down and distance and to the new scheme brought in by a fresh coach-ing staff, which has allowed the Gators to disguise 
what they’re doing defensively.

Young posts double-double, limits Sullinger
Ohio State into open looks on 11-of-22 shoot-
ing from beyond the arc.
Freshman guard Brad Beal had a team- 
and career-high 17 points while going 6 for 16 
from the floor. Shooting guard Kenny Boyn-
ton added 15, including three made 3-point-
ers. But the pair also combined for eight give-
aways. 
As the lone Gator in the paint for much of 
the game, starting sophomore center Patric 
Young recorded his second straight double-double with 14 points and a game-high 12 rebounds. 
“Patric keeps playing, motor’s running 
and I was really proud of his attitude,” Dono-van said. 
“Our guys looked at that and said, ‘Geez, 
he’s only got one shot, we need to get the ball to him a little bit more.’”
Young also made an impact defensively 
against last year’s National Freshman of the Year, Jared Sullinger, who scored 16 points but only managed eight field goal attempts. Eight of Sullinger’s points came from the free-throw line, where the Buckeyes ended the game with a large advantage.
“The difference really in the game was 
they took 34 free throws to our 21, and we didn’t shoot it particularly well from the free-throw line,” Donovan said.
Half of the Gators’ 3-pointers in the first 
half were made by junior forward Erik Mur -
phy, who finished the game with 14 points. After going a disappointing 2 of 9 from the field in the season opener against Jackson State, the 6-foot-10 Murphy flourished from behind the arc and was a perfect 4 for 4.
Even with Murphy’s hot shooting, the 
Gators hit a 6:30 stretch between halves when they didn’t make a field goal. Coupled with nine turnovers in 20 minutes, the scoring drought allowed the Buckeyes to take control of the game.
“We then started kicking it around and 
turning it over; then we got into a little bit of a funk where we really weren’t making shots,” Donovan said. “We needed to have more resiliency on the court, to get back and fight defensively .”

After Saturday’s loss to South 
Carolina, John Brantley sat 
aboard a flight heading south. 
Back to Gainesville and life as the 
Gators’ starting quarterback, at least for a few more games.
Sitting at 5-5 near the end of 
the last season of his collegiate career, Brantley couldn’t help but think, “What if?” 
It wasn’t supposed to be this 
way. Not for Brantley. Not for Florida. Three close losses in four 
games can have that effect on a player, especially the quarter -
back, the leader. After the defense failed to stop the Gamecocks in 
the fourth quarter of a 17-12 loss, 
and Brantley and the offense couldn’t mount a late rally, he said the team’s plane ride home was “very quiet.” 
“It’s tough to lose like that,” 
he said. “It was a tough flight.”
But Brantley has had more 
than his share of adversity through two seasons as Florida’s signal-caller. 
He has faced the unenvi-
able task of replacing one of the game’s greats. 
He was forced to play in a 
system tailored to his weakness-es — running read options from spread formations — instead of 
his strengths. 
And last year’s coaching staff 
didn’t respect him, trotting him 
out as a relief pitcher of sorts in 
third-down situations while guys 
like Trey Burton and Jordan Reed took meaningful snaps at quar -
terback. 
Fans called for his head; called 
him a bust, even booed him at home during a 2010 season when he finished with more inter -
ceptions (10) than touchdowns 
(nine). All of that was supposed 
to change this year. Brantley had Charlie Weis calling the shots in a pro-style offense designed 
around his abilities.
He came out playing well, completing 64 percent of his passes and throwing four touch-
downs while leading the Gators to a 4-0 start. 
Against Alabama on Oct. 
1, he threw for 190 yards and a touchdown in the first half before suffering an injury to his right ankle that kept him out for three weeks.
In his absence, Florida’s sea-
son crumbled, and the same fans that booed him a year ago were 
clamoring for his return.
“All those people who wanted 
him out of here now can’t wait to 
get him back,” offensive coordina-
tor Charlie Weis said before the 
Georgia game, 
when Brantley 
made his return. “Isn’t that funny 
how that story 
changes?” 
The Gators 
lost that game, just as they did 
this past Saturday against the 
Gamecocks. While quarterbacks and head coaches always receive the brunt of criticism for a loss, this season of close calls and 
what-ifs does not fall on a beaten-
up Brantley.
He has dealt with a receiving 
corps that struggles to get open, 
an offensive line that can’t keep 
him upright and a defense that can’t get off the field in pivotal situations.
“John hasn’t been full speed 
since he got hurt in the Alabama game, but the guy goes out every day and competes and practices and tapes it up and does the best 
job he can do,” coach Will Mus-
champ said.
Since returning, Brantley has 
not been able to take snaps from 
under center because the pain is 
just too much when pivoting to turn for handoffs. He has been sacked 10 times in three games and taken multiple hard hits. 
Still, Brantley stands strong.“I’ve definitely matured from 
last season, the ups and the downs,” he said. “We’ve been on 
the top and now we’re on the bot-
tom.” 
With hopes of a Southeastern 
Conference title gone, with the chance of a marquee bowl evap-
orated, what’s left to play for, 
John?
“My teammates,” he said. 
“Last year, this year, we’ve been through a lot. I’m here for them.” 
Brantley isn’t worried about 
his legacy. With games against Furman and Florida State re-
maining in his star-crossed ca-
reer, Brantley isn’t focusing on what could have been.
“I was a Gator before I came 
here, I’m going to be a Gator when I leave,” Brantley said Monday. 
“We’ve got to go out there and 
prove to ourselves and prove to 
everyone that we’re getting bet-
ter and everything’s going to work out.”

IN NCAA TOURNAMENT OPENING-ROUND WIN AGAINST FLORIDA GULF COAST.
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Writer
Sometimes, Florida just needs to use its head.
That’s why Gators coach Becky Burleigh con-
tinues to emphasize aggressive tactics when her 
team has set pieces.
During the season, the Gators have gradu-
ally become a more successful team in their free 
kicks and corner kicks. Both types of set pieces 
are high-risk plays involving several players go-
ing for the ball at the same time.
“The willingness to bring that physical pres-
ence to the offensive side of the game is just as important as the willingness to bring it defen-
sively,” Burleigh said.
Florida scored two goals off set pieces in its 
3-0 win against Florida Gulf Coast on Saturday 
in the first round of the NCAA tournament  — 
both off headers.
For the first goal, junior midfielder Erika 
Tymrak sent a corner kick into the box that was 
deflected back to her. 
She played it back through the middle of the 
box again, and senior midfielder Tahnai Annis sent a diving header past the keeper.The second goal came when Annis fought 
through traffic to head a free kick from freshman forward Annie Speese.
Despite the recent success, Burleigh still thinks 
there is room for improvement in Florida’s play in the box, specifically setting teammates up for scoring chances.
“We had numerous chances to get to the 
end line to serve balls or even serve balls early that we didn’t quite execute like we’d like to,” Burleigh said. “Our execution in the final third is still something that we can get better at. Can 
we serve quality balls in the box? Can we make 
good runs in the box to get on the end of those balls?”
Burleigh believes the Gators will continue to 
jell on offense if they play without fear. 
“When you are going up for a ball with the 
goalkeeper, the goalkeeper has hands and you don’t,” she said. 
“You are probably going to get hit. Just being 
OK with that and willing to risk that is the physi-cal presence we are looking for.”

Florida has put an added emphasis on attacking during free kicks and 
corner kicks. The team scored on two such plays Saturday against FGCU.

Men’s Cross Country

After five years of up-and-down per -
formances, the Gators have finally found a 
place in the NCAA Championship.
When asked what was different about 
this year’s squad, coach Todd Morgan said it 
was a persistent dedication to the everyday 
things. Coupled with talent, adherence to the “small things,” like eating right and sleeping well, has led to Florida actively competing 
for a win in every race.  
Well, almost every race.
The men finished 32nd out of 39 teams at 
the Wisconsin adidas Invitational, the only race the Gators fell out of the top-two spots.
Florida must face the frightening realiza-
tion that Wisconsin may have been a harbin-ger of bad news to come. However, Morgan would rather view it as simply a bump in the road.
“In hindsight, that was a wake-up call 
we needed,” Morgan said of Florida’s worst finish of the year. “We know now what to expect. We have got confidence back in our fitness and those guys are going to be bet-ter prepared going into that. Looking back, that’s something that made these guys stron-ger.”
Sophomores Mark Parrish and Matt Miz-
ereck, along with freshman Jimmy Clark, have catapulted Florida into its first appear -
ance at the national championship since 2006. Although Morgan had his share of talented runners in the past, this youthful group has separated itself from the others with con-sistent top-notch performances week after week.  
Prior to this season, Florida won or was a 
runner-up five times since Oct. 2008. In just six races this year, the Gators have earned five top-two finishes.
An unforeseen second-place result by this 
year’s men in the NCAA South Regional au-tomatically qualified them for a spot in the championship race.
But Morgan is looking past the hoopla of 
the NCAA Championship and is focusing on keeping his men at a consistently elite level 
of running.
“If you go into these meets doing what 
you’ve been doing all year, then your out-
come is going to be a lot better,” he said.Consistency paves way for UF’s first NCAA appearance since 2006
