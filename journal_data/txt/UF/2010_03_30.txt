UF ADMINISTRATION
Fall tuition increase likely
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
By this fall, UF's tuition will
likely increase by 15 percent in or-
der to bring it closer to the national
average, according to UF President
Bernie Machen.
The hike could accompany a
switch to block differential tuition,
which benefits students who take
15 or more credit hours per semes-
ter and would create a more steady
revenue stream for the university.
Under block differential tuition,
the state could increase tuition by
8 percent, and, according to Ma-
chen, UF would then increase tu-
ition by 7 percent, which brings
the total increase to 15 percent.
The 8 percent increase affects
the tuition cost per credit hour
while the 7 percent increase is
based on a 15 credit hour courseload, which means students get
a better value by taking 15 credit
hours or more.
A bill related to the change in
tuition policy for Florida public
universities is currently being de-
bated in the state legislature.
Before the change is made
at UF, the bill
must be ap-
proved by the
Legislature and
signed by the
governor. UF
would need to
notify parents if
administrators
wanted to implement the change
in the fall.
According to Machen, block
tuition encourages students to
graduate faster.
Currently, 58 percent of stu-
dents graduate in four years, hesaid.
As the cost of education be-
comes more of a burden for stu-
dents, Machen said he hopes they
will want to play a bigger role in
the university's budgeting pro-
cess.
"The student voice is impor-
tant," he said.
Different budget proposals are
being considered in both houses of
the Florida State Legislature, and
more budget cuts could be on the
horizon.
Machen emphasized that there
are some areas of the budget he
would prefer not to cut.
"It is our preference not to
make any more personnel or pro-
gram cuts," he said.
At this month's Board of Trust-
ees meeting, he expressed his
concerns about cutting employee
health and retirement benefits.Graduate students

0 UF MADE A POLICY
BANNING SPONSORED
TRAVEL TO HAITI.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
When Jon Bougher and Roman
Safiullin went back to Haiti earlier
this month, they shot about 12 more
hours of footage for their master's
thesis documentary, which follows
Planting Peace, a philanthropic or-
ganization.
Unfortunately for the two UF
graduate students, not one minute
of the footage will be allowed in
the final cut, rendering their thesis
project incomplete.
In February, the university
established a policy banning UF-
sponsored travel to Haiti, so all the
material gathered after the earth-
quake cannot be used in the stu-
dents' final project.
According to UF spokesman
Steve Orlando, the university's
travel policy is meant to ensure
student safety. The university is
not certain students who travel
there would have access to food,
water and shelter, Orlando said.
"If you're watching CNN and
watching Anderson Cooper in
Haiti, the network is providing for
his needs," Orlando said. "Two
students going down there might
not be getting the same access to
those resources."
The thesis presentation is sched-
uled for April 15, and Bougher
and Safiullin are concerned about
whether they will be allowed to
graduate because they feel their
project is unfinished.
"It's very unfortunate that a
university that has very high stan-
dards wants us to submit some-
thing very incomplete," Safiullin
said. "That's not journalistic."
Bougher, who was recently
named the Outstanding Master's
Student in the College of Journal-
ism and Communications, said he
and Safiullin are more concerned
with their work than with taking a
shot at the university administra-
tion."As journalists, our goal is to
get the best story possible," he
said. "We're not trying to give the
university a black eye; we're just
trying to make the best film that
we can."
In an e-mail to the College of
Journalism and Communications
faculty, Churchill Roberts, co-
director of the Documentary In-
stitute, said the students had two
choices -they could either submit
a thesis that didn't have any post-
earthquake footage or abandon the
thesis track and fulfill their degree
requirements by taking compre-
hensive exams.
According to Roberts, both
options "raise serious questions
about academic integrity."
Linda Hon, the executive asso-
ciate dean of the College of Jour-
nalism and Communications, and
Debbie Treise, the college's associ-
ate dean for graduate studies, met
with Roberts to discuss alternative
ways the students could complete
their thesis work.
Hon, through her assistant, de-
clined an inter-
U F view and said
Academics she "doesn't
feel that she can
respond since this is a university
policy."
Roberts, who called the situa-
tion "a terrible embarrasment" for
the university, said Bougher and
Safiullin are more than capable of
filming in Haiti. While the wel-
fare of students is paramount, the
university is setting a dangerous
precedent by not allowing student
journalists to travel to disaster ar-
eas, he said.
"That's what attracts journal-
ists," he said. "If this is the uni-
versity's knee-jerk reaction every
time there's a natural disaster, they
might as well close the door to the
College of journalism and Com-
munications."
For now, Roberts said he is fo-
cused on making sure Bougher and
Safiullin graduate and produce the
best product they can.
"I would give anything to find a
solution that would be acceptable
for the university and for [the Doc-
umentary Institute]," he said.

Krishnas share culture
HIT TOOK PLACE FROM 10 A.M.
TO 2 P.M.
By DEANNA CRAFT
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Hare Krishnas set up more than
their normal lunch buffet Monday.
The third annual Festival of India,
which took place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
featured four different tents with edu-
cational displays where students could
ask questions about Krishna beliefs or
learn about vegetarianism, reincarnation
and the Illustrated Bhagavad Gita sacred
text.
About 100 students stopped by the
tents throughout the day.
The event was sponsored by the
Krishna House, an outreach center where
students can live or learn about the be-
liefs of the Hare Krishnas.
Billy Frasier, a mechanical engineer-
ing junior, was on his way to Library
(80165094P
1iWest when he stopped to look at the Il-
lustrated Bhagavad Gita tent.
"It's all very strange to me," he said.
"The idea of reincarnation and karma
and Hare Krishna. I couldn't even think
about going vegetarian."
The event did not just feature educa-
tional displays.
Krishna-kripa Dasa, an expert on the
Hare Krishna's sacred text
Cultural sang about the Bhagavad
Events Gita throughout the morn-
ing.
Krishna-kripa Dasa and Carl Wood-
ham, chaplain of Krishna House, also
walked around the lawn answering
questions from students, including ques-
tions about the sacred text.
Erika Trnka, a linguistics junior, said
she liked the exhibit because it was infor-
mational and the Hare Krishnas were not
pushy.
"It allows me to learn about Krishna
without feeling like I'm being preached
to," Trnka said.

Counselors see increase in
eating disorders in spring
By NATASHA BETTY
Alligator Contributing Writer
After packing on the pounds during
colder months and concealing the weight
under heavy winter clothing, students begin
to lose weight fast before summer.
"Leading up to the end of spring, we get
more students who want to control their
body image," said Liz Lagasse, a nutri-
tionist at UF's Student Health Care Center
who counsels students about nutrition and
healthy dieting.
She said there has been a spike in ap-
pointments at the center before summer.
While most people have some distress
about their appearance in shorts and bath-
ing suits, it's especially troubling for those
who suffer from eating disorders, she said.
"It's easy to imagine how the pressure
to look good can trigger someone to go to
the extreme to fit in and look the part," she
said.

overly worried about their body image and
seem to have the potential to develop an eat-

them to talk about themselves with respect

someone to go to the extreme to

Marissa Noelte, a health science major
and Student Recreation and Fitness Center
employee, said she has overheard girls say-
ig they are getting in shape for summer.
"If I wasn't secure in my body image, I
would probably fall into that trap of being
super thin because of what I see in maga-
zines and on TV," Noelte said.
Eating disorders include anorexia, buli-
mia and binge eating disorder.
"It's not an easy issue," Lagasse said. "It
cannot be cured by one word or a quote."

New Alachua County health program director takes office
He was hired about two weeks ago
By CAITLIN E. O'CONNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Alachua County health program
Choices (Community Health Offering Inno-
vative Care and Educational Services), which
provides health care services to the county's
working uninsured, got a new director Mon-
day afternoon.
Bob Bailey, who has a master's degree in
health administration from the University ofCincinnati, said he has worked in health care
for more than 35 years.
Bailey has lived in Gainesville for three
years working for AvMed Health Plans.
Before that, he worked for various health
management organizations in the Philadel-
phia area for 12 years.
Bailey, who began his first day in office
Monday, was hired about two weeks ago to
replace the previous director, Lorraine Aus-
tin."We want to get similar benefits
to people in other parts of the
county who may not have the qual-
ity of care as those in Gainesville
proper."
Bob Bailey
Choices director
Austin left four months ago for a different
position.
Bailey said he wants to extend the benefitsoffered by Choices to more eligible citizens in
innovative ways, such as mobile health screen-
ings.
"We want to get similar benefits to people
in other parts of the county who may not have
the quality of care as those in Gainesville prop-
er," he said.
Bailey's appointment comes on the heels of
Congress' historic passage of the Health Care
and Education Affordability Reconciliation
Act, which will reportedly extend health care
coverage to 32 million Americans.
According to a press release, Bailey's start-
ing salary is $66,146.
Mayor recalls climate
summit at coffee house
By ALEX ORLANDO

Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan
was one of 80 mayors the White
House invited to attend the Co-
penhagen Climate Conference in
December, and she almost missed
her chance to attend the interna-
tional summit.
Hanrahan recounted that her
December trip to Denmark to at-
tend the conference meant to act
as an international successor to
the Kyoto Protocol Monday eve-
ning to about 30 people at Volta
Coffee, Tea & Chocolate.
As Hanrahan recalls, she al-
most forgot to collect her confer-
ence passes before her trip across
the globe.
The international conference
was held in Copenhagen from
Dec. 6 to Dec. 18 with Hanrahan
attending the conference from
Dec. 14 to Dec. 17.
Her trip was funded by Local
Governments for Sustainability, amembership association of more
than 600 U.S. local governments
committed to protection and sus-
tainability.
The talk at Volta, which was
sponsored by Alachua County
Young Democrats, also included
a Q-and-A session where mem-
bers of the audience questioned
the mayor about Gainesville's
sustainable future.
Derek Helmick, a UF senior
and member of Alachua County
Young Democrats, asked Hanra-
han what she thought the most
effective use of her time was as
mayor.
Hanrahan cited reducing
Gainesville's reliance on coal.
"To up renewable energy to
26 percent is a pretty cool thing,"
Helmick said, referring to Hanra-
han's plan for a biomass power
plant for the city.

FEMALE, 46 PERCENT MALE.
By JULIA MCCLURE
Alligator ContributingWriter
Nicholas Slater was sitting in his health class of about 50 stu-
dents when he noticed something bizarre about his class.
"I'm a guy," the UF psychology and sociology sophomore
said. "I look around, and there's only four other guys in here."
But he said he didn't mind being surrounded by more wom-
en in the classroom.
"It's kind of nice," he said, with a laugh. "To be honest, I
wouldn't want to go to a university with a lot of guys."
Slater picked up on a national trend that is growing at UF.
National college enrollment is now 57 percent female and 43
percent male.
According to UF spokesman Steve Orlando, six out of 10 new
UF students will be women in fall 2010, which is the largest gen-
der gap favoring female students that UF has ever had. UF's fall
2009 enrollment was 54 percent female and 46 percent male, ac-
cording to the UF Office of Institutional Planning and Research.
UF is aware of the gap but not doing anything to balance the
numbers, Orlando said. But he said the school isn't discriminat-
ing against male applicants.
"Boys wouldn't be admitted because they're boys," he said.
"Girls are being admitted because they are doing the things to be
admitted and boys aren't."

Hillel holds first of two
Passover Seder meals
Andrew Simler and Cat Dunn pass bowls of matzo ball soup at the passover dinner at Hillel
Tuesday night.By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
Hillel held its first of two Passover
Seders on Monday night. About 300
people attended.
Passover, which lasts for eight days,
is the celebration of the Jewish people's
deliverance from slavery in Egypt and
has been celebrated for thousands of
years.
"It really is the creation of the Jewish
people," said Keith Dvorchik, executive
director of UF Hillel.
Hillel's second Seder is tonight at
8:30 p.m.
The Passover Seder is always done
in the same order, no matter where it is
celebrated. This creates a sense of uni-
ty among the Jewish people, Dvorchik
said.
But Hillel did do something unique.
Rather than just reading the Passover
story, Hillel student leaders acted it out,
which made the Passover story more
fun for Jewish students, according toDvorchik.
He said Passover is a time for family
to get together, and it can be a difficult
time for students who are away from
home.
But it can also be a new and positive
experience.
Brianna Peters, a UF freshman, said
she misses not being at her grandmoth-
er's house with the rest of her family,
but she is glad to celebrate the holiday
with her friend, who sat across from her
at the set table.
"It's going to be a new experience for
me," she said.
Some students gathered with both
their families and their peers, including
Matt Bloom, a biology major, who came
to Hillel with his brother, mother and
grandmother.
"I enjoy my religion, and I'm glad
that Hillel has so many Jewish students
to celebrate the holiday with," Bloom
said.
Hillel's second Seder meal will be
held at 8:30 tonight.
About 200 celebrate diversity at 'IRHA-bian' dance
* THE DANCE KICKED OFF A
WEEK OF EVENTS.
By ANDREA RUMBAUGH
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Inter-Residence Hall As-
sociation turned up the heat at its
Hotter Than Hot Diversity Dance
Showcase Monday night.
About 200 people filled the Reitz
Union Rion Ballroom at 8 p.m. towatch performances reflecting the
diversity of UF's students through
dances originating from places
including West Africa, Brazil and
Ireland, said Stephani Babcock, di-
rector of the dance showcase.
The dance showcase is part of
IRHA's annual Residence Hall
Week, which began Friday and
ends Thursday. The week, themed
IRHAbian Nights, is a chance for
the individual resident halls to pool
their resources and have a week-long event for all UF students.
"It's just a great way to bring
together residents from different
areas," Babcock said.
It takes about a year to organize
the event, and al-
On though small details
like arranging the
music can be stress-
ful, the final product is the most
rewarding part of Babcock's year.
"It's a stress that's worth it,"
she said. "It's an experience that'sworth it."
The audience especially appre-
ciated the event's diversity.
Sriyani Dissanayake, a mother
of a dancer in a classical Indian
dance club Gator Natyam, enjoys
UF's diversity.
"I like all kinds of music and
dance, so I'm enjoying [the show-
case]," she said. "I'm glad you are
having this type of event for stu-

RNC spending both
comical and outrageousWe understand Republicans are super pissed that
whole historic social welfare, insurance-for-the-poor
bill passed last week, and why shouldn't they be?
Who cares about the mere 32 million Americans who will now
be able to afford crazy things like hospital visits and life-sav-
ing medication?
Can we get a "Wasteful spending, whoop, whoop!" in the
house?
But we're not too sure about the way the Republican Na-
tional Committee vented its frustration with those pesky
House Democrats last month.
According to an RNC monthly financial report, our very
own GOP spent nearly $2,000 on "food" at the sex-themed
nightclub Voyeur West Hollywood.
As if this tiny two-grand scandal wasn't sweet enough,
Voyeur West Hollywood is a nightclub that allegedly features
topless dancers in bondage outfits.
We have to wonder, are these really the same lawmakers
who protest certain -and we dare say more important -
bills about health care and jobs for reasons of expenses, while
paying strippers $2,000 to shake their leather-bound loins for a
couple Benjamins hanging out of their bejeweled G-strings?
At least no one can say the GOP doesn't know how to par-
ty.
And while we're on the topic, we might as well mention
that the Republican Party spent nearly a whopping $14,000 at
the New York City candy store Dylan's Candy Bar.
At least we can rest peacefully knowing those sure-to-be-
diabetic-soon recipients of candy-crowded gift baskets will
have guaranteed health care.
He Bangs .He
ur favorite She-Bangin singer will
most definitely not be
banging any more "shes."
After years of no one spec-
ulating about the skimpy-
Speedo-wearing, surrogate-
sponsoring father of two,
Ricky Martin has finally
opened his boca about what
he means by "Livin' La Vida
Loca."
In an announcement al-
most as shocking as a weath-
er forecast at the North Pole,
Martin (finally) admitted his
sensual dance moves and
scarf-sporting style wasn't
just due to his Latin lifestyle.
He is gay.
And to be more accurate,
according to his public an-
nouncement, Martin is a "for-
tunate homosexual."
We agree with our favor-
ite have-you-even-made-a-
CD-since-we-were-in-ele-
mentary-school singer in his
fortunate qualities. We're
much more excited in this
announcement than whenClay Aiken made the same
announcement to the unsur-
prised world.
A Google image search
of Martin reveals photos of
a soul-patch-sporting, high-
lighted-hair dream boy with
an obvious affinity for bath-
ing suits that accentuate his
beautiful "bon bon."
So, we're supposed to be
surprised by all this, Ricky?
C'mon.
You make Elton John look
like a toolbelt-toting Home
Depot fanatic.
We knew ever since we
laid eyes on you wearing that
shimmering long-sleeved
shirt on the cover of that self-
titled album we secretly fell
in love with.
And we love you even
more for it. We know that it
often takes more courage to
tell the truth than to live a
lie, and we wish you nothing
but future happiness in your
"vida loca."
Until then, we'll be wait-
ing on you, Ms. Seacrest.

Suicides should inspire compassion
ix Cornell University students have committed sui-cide since the start of the school year. Two of the six
took their lives earlier this month.
This has placed the issues of suicide and depression as
topics of national conversation -a rarity, given how the
mere mention of those words in everyday conversation of-
ten yields discomfort, a tense hush and a hurried change of
subject. This is a terrible reality, given that few topics could
benefit more from open, honest discussion than those two.
Consider that some of the cruelest and most vicious forms
of depression don't make you feel too weak to get out of it,
they make you believe a way out of it doesn't even exist. De-
pression doesn't make you think that the supposed "selfish-
ness" of suicide is justifiable, it gets you thinking that you're
such a burden to the people you care about that removing
said burden is the most selfless thing you can do.
By no means am I trying to romanticize suicide. Few
would ever seriously suggest that there's anything romantic
about the emotional writhing that prefaces a suicide attempt
or the heartbreak that's born from it. Fewer still would have
attempted it themselves, or has held the hand of someone
they love who had attempted it, or had to say goodbye to
someone they love who completed an attempt.
I am suggesting, though, that some compassion and un-
derstanding is called for -or, at least, something more than
the accusations of weakness, cowardice and selfishness that
sometimes accompany a discussion of someone taking their
own life.
Is the idea to mitigate how tragic suicide is by framing it
as a moral failure? That doesn't work -ask someone who
has lost a best friend, a child or a significant other and see
how much mitigation actually occurs.
Or is the idea to make suicide such an embarrassment that
nobody does it? That doesn't work, either -you can't shame
the hurt out of someone, and adding a layer of "feeling bad
for feeling bad" does little more than further isolate someonewho already feels alone.
It's not contingent upon any of us
to take ownership of anybody else's
-1 happiness. It's an unfair responsibility
to place on oneself, and it's unfair to
place an expectation on somebody to
Joe Dellosa "get better" on someone else's terms
letters@alligator org or timetable.
However, we do have a respon-
sibility, in whatever way we can, to
make it clear that we are here for each other. That feelings
of loneliness, frustration and fear are universal and bind us
together in a sometimes horrible, sometimes beautiful sort of
way. That failure is an entirely natural part of living, and it's
rarely final or irrevocable. That the love we offer each other is
not dependent on any artificial, quantitative measure of suc-
cess -and more importantly, that our love is offered not just
when it's convenient or easy to do so.
And that it really, honestly is OK to talk about it aloud.
I don't pretend that tossing around words like love is
some automatic, magical solution. Suicide is a complex prob-
lem for which there are no simple answers. And it's inappro-
priate to use the deaths of six students to draw presumptu-
ous conclusions while their loved ones and their campus are
all still mourning.
But if nothing else, the tragedy in Cornell is a reminder,
however awful, that everybody has their own stuff going on
-their own private battles that they're quietly fighting, their
own personal hells they're enduring without any outward
sign that something's wrong.
When we speak of love, I have to imagine that that in part
means acknowledging this and giving each other the dignity
and decency of treating each other accordingly. And cyni-
cism or fear of triteness aside, I really don't think we can be
guilty of having too much love.

Sacrifices, transformation are needed
for change
This is to correct something a letter said
Friday: Americans do not elect leaders to al-
ter their country. Now just to quickly get to
my point, a leader is meant to usher in what
is best for a group of people.
Without transformation, no change can
be established. Without this principle, we
would still be under England's control.
America's victory in World War II wouldn't
have been possible without a major trans-
formation of our economy forced in by the
government.
Maybe this statement is what is wrong
with our system. Leaders shouldn't be elect-
ed to do nothing. They are there to protect
the country and to do what is best for it.
As far as the war between Democrats and
the American people. This represents what
is wrong with the American democratic
system. A bipartisan system is, by design,
flawed; people have long since been voting
by party not by views. I cannot count how
many surveys I have seen that show most of
the voters cannot even tell you the funda-
mental policies a candidate has.
There is one word I would like to leave
readers with: sacrifice. Every major impact
requires sacrifice -sacrifice of time, reputa-
tion and even lives. Soldiers have sacrificed
their lives fighting for their country's right
to be free and live free. Inventors sacrifice
time and energy for their projects. I think
we all know about 10,000 ways not to do
something. And while we don't like change,
sacrifices are needed. Food for thought.

Reader's letter about health insurance
was inaccurate
Alligator, get a hold of yourself.
First, while I was happy to see Chelsea
Fleck's inaccuracy-laden letter addressed,
surely someone wrote in criticizing it for
said inaccuracies properly. In any case, why
you chose to publish the response by Mitch-ell Norton is beyond me.
I don't know what reality he lives in, but
when not purchasing something subjects
you to a tax that purchasers are exempt
from, you have effectively been forced to
make a purchase. This is such a basic con-
cept that I can hardly believe it needs to be
pointed out.
For full disclosure purposes, I hate stupid
Democrats and stupid Republicans equally.
Finally, lol at that "Double J" article. WTF?

City needs to focus on gender equality
in workplace, not in bars
The city's actions prohibiting bars and
restaurants from serving ladies' nights spe-
cials are anything but an anti-discrimination
attempt. If the city wants to stop promoting
stereotypes and societal divisions, maybe it
should focus its efforts on making sure that
men and women are treated equally in the
workplace, especially in matters of equal
pay for equal work.
After all, if I'm not getting paid as much
for my work as the man sitting next to me at
the office, I certainly can't afford to pay as
much for a drink as the man sitting next to
me at the bar.

Dove World pastor should ashamed for
displaying hatred
It would seem that Dove World Outreach
Center has a pastor appropriately named.
Having viewed the video of his hate-filled
rhetoric concerning a runoff election for
mayor of the fine city of Gainesville, I be-
lieve that the minister in question, Wayne
Sapp, definitely is one. Hatred in the name
of Jesus is simply unbiblical, hypocritical
and unacceptable. Shame!

Reed's transition to tight end key for UF'
By MIKE McCALL at quarterback, and that was evi- primarily out of the I-form, and the offense for two series at the
Alligator Staff Writer dent at Monday's practice. Reed even took snaps out of a end of practice.
mmccall@alligatororg Florida's first team worked Wildcat formation and managed On a run up the middle, he
You probably won't find Jor-
dan Reed's name listed as a key
player for the 2010 Florida foot-
ball team, but his development
will be a deciding factor in the
success or failure of the Gators'
offense.
The 6-foot-3, 240-pound red-
shirt freshman has been UF's
starting tight end in spring prac-
tice after moving from quarter-
back last season. And without a
reliable tight end, Florida's hopes
of using more of the I-formation
would likely go down the drain.
"We've got to find that tight
end. That's a keystone
piece. .Jordan Reed has
to have a big spring here."
Steve Addazio
UF offensive coordinator
"We've got to find that tight
end," offensive coordinator Steve
Addazio said. "That's a keystone
piece. .Jordan Reed has to have
a big spring here."
Addazio said the Gators' of-
fense will look different from the
option-oriented schemes of the
past few seasons with Tim TebowHarrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF tight end Jordan Reed cuts upfield after a catch during the Gators' spring practice on March 22. Reed
saw action in Monday's practice at his original position of quarterback.s offense
took a big hit from linebacker
Lorenzo Edwards that drew
cheers from the rest of the de-
fense, but he won't be getting a
red, non-contact jersey anytime
soon.
Quarterbacks coach Scot Lo-
effler said putting Reed back at
quarterback was "experimental"
and that he won't switch back
permanently. But that could
change with an injury to starter
John Brantley, who only has
freshman Trey Burton backing
him up.
Loeffler wouldn't specify the
team's plan if Brantley gets hurt,
but he said it would be a combi-
nation of solutions rather than a
single replacement. Punter Chas
Henry -who played quarter-
back in high school -has also
spent time at the position this
spring.
MOORE M.I.A., BUSHELL RE-
TURNS: Receiver Carl Moore, an
expected starter for next season,
wasn't at Monday's practice.
Moore practiced Saturday, and
receivers coach Zach Azzanni
and a UF spokesman declined to
specify whether his absence was
due to injury or off-field issues.

And it took him just two days to relearn
the position.
After starting the season splitting time
between catcher and first base, Maddox
could be making his fifth-straight start at
the hot corner tonight when No. 8 Florida
(18-5) takes on No. 4 FSU (19-4) at 7 in Jack-
sonville.
"It felt a little weird because I haven'tplayed there in so long," Maddox said.
"But I'm getting used to it."
Usual third baseman Bryson Smith has
not played since March 20, when he dislo-
cated his finger against Mississippi State.
Needing a replacement, coach Kevin
O'Sullivan asked Mad-
dox to field ground balls
the Monday after Smith's
injury. Maddox played
Baseball third base for a short time
as a ninth grader at Ea-
gle's View Academy, but
his play as a catcher drew scouts' attention
so the position did not stick.
"To be honest with you, there was no
hesitation at all when Bryson hurt his finger
as to what we needed to do," O'Sullivan

With the departure of so manystarters from last year's team,
spring practice presents a great
opportunity for players to gain ground
on the battle for a first-team spot in the
fall.
The leaders and competitors are begin-
ning to emerge for those openings.
Position Battle No. 1: Cornerback op-
posite Janoris Jenkins
Contenders: Senior Moses Jenkins, red-
shirt sophomores Jeremy Brown and Adri-
an Bushell and freshmen Jaylen Watkins
and Josh Shaw
Leader: It could be a Jenkins-squared
pairing next year. After three years at UF,
Moses Jenkins is finally playing with the
first team, but it won't be an easy task to
hold off the highly touted freshmen.
Dark Horse: Shaw was the UF's top-
cornerback recruit, and he has shown
flashes of that but needs to be more consis-
tent. With a new cornerbacks coach (Teryl
Austin), everyone gets a fresh start, and afreshman could win
the starting job.

No. 2: Middle Line-

Contenders:
Bobby Callovi Sophomore Jon Bos-

Bobby's World more Brendan Bealbcallovi@alligator org and senior Lorenzo
Edwards
Leader: Whenever coaches and play-
ers talk about who needs to step up on
defense, it is Bostic's name that comes up.
Bostic and Beal have shared time with the
first team, but Bostic has the advantage.
Dark Horse: There really is no dark
horse in this race because it is only two-
man competition. Edwards' move inside is
most likely for depth reasons.
Position Battle No. 3: Tight End

mond Parks and Jordan Reed and fresh-

Last Wednesday, just two days
after he began practicing third base,CoasL. In e irsL a- aL t e game,he fielded a grounder and gunned it
to first to record the out.
During that sequence, Mad-
dox flashed the cannon that made
UF freshman Austin Maddox practiced just two days at third base
before starting at the position.tions at DH
him a coveted recruit. He was once
clocked at 94 mph as a pitcher, and
his strong arm is an asset at third.
"If I can keep the ball in front
of me, I've got a good enough arm
where I can pick it up and throw
(runners) out," Maddox said.
Despite playing four games at
the position, Maddox has rarely
been tested so it is unclear if he can
be UF's long-term third baseman.
Maddox has recorded only five
assists and already has an error.
Moving to his left while tracking
a ground ball Sunday, Maddox
botched an attempt to scoop the ball
and then could not locate it as it rest-
ed on the infield grass.
Maddox was able to recover,
cleanly fielding two ground balls to
help end the inning.
Already leading the Gators with
seven home runs and batting aver-
age of .378, Maddox could be even
more valuable as an everyday third
baseman. He started the season split-
ting time between designated hitter
and first base, and Florida was not
getting much productivity out of its
third baseman during that stretch.
Before dislocating his finger,
Smith hit .255 and committed four
errors in 16 games.
But with Maddox now at third,
O'Sullivan can add his next-best
batter to the lineup as DH. In Mad-
dox's first three games at third, the
strategy was unsuccessful as four
players combined to hit 1 for 10 out
of the DH spot.
Then on Sunday, Tyler Thomp-
son showed how much Maddox's
position change could help the
Gators, going 3 for 5 as the DH and
scoring two runs.
An extra bat could provide a
boost to the UF's offense, assuming
Maddox can shore up his defense.
"I feel like I've been doing pretty
well over there," Maddox said. "I'm
getting more comfortable every day.
The more play over there, the more
comfortable I'm going to get."TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 15

Meanwhile, cornerback Adrian Bushell was on the
sidelines in shorts, making his first appearance.
UF coach Urban Meyer said at the beginning of spring
practice that Bushell was dealing with aca-
demic and other off-field problems.
When he returns to the field, Bushell will
be battling Moses Jenkins, Jeremy Brown,Football Josh Shaw and Jaylen Watkins for the cor-
nerback spot opposite Janoris Jenkins.
"Because he just started, there's a mandatory two days
without pads before he can get in pads," UF defensive
coordinator Teryl Austin said. "Hopefully by Friday and
Saturday he'll be out there. He's behind right now, but
we'll get an idea of where he is and where he fits in."

Dark Horse: Clark probably
doesn't have a chance of winning
the job but has shown the ability to
burn his defender deep. If nothing
else, he is going to make a great re-
turn specialist next season.

Florida hopes to learn from mistakes against Oregon
Turnovers, poor defense have led to losses
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Florida knows what it does
wrong in losses, but the young
team can't seem to avoid making
those mistakes.
In its four defeats this season,
three against ranked opponents,
UF has committed 83 turnovers,
allowed 61 goals and failed to cap-
italize on its scoring opportunities.
"I'm not going to make
excuses for it, as a group
we need to figure out
how to overcome those
obstacles and beat these
higher ranked teams, and
learning how to win and
compete at that level."
Amanda O'Leary
UF lacrosse coach
The Gators (6-4, 0-2 American
Lacrosse Conference) will look
to avoid that kind of play tonight
when they host Oregon (4-6) at
6:30.
Of the teams' four common op-
ponents, they each defeated Jack-
sonville and St. Bonaventure but
lost to North Carolina and JohnsHopkins.
In a matchup of similar teams,
Florida will emphasize keeping
its focus in the face of adversity,
should it fall behind.
"We compete for a half or a cer-tain amount of time, and then we
don't," UF coach Amanda O'Leary
said. "I'm not going to make ex-
cuses for it, as a group we need to
figure out how to overcome those
obstacles and beat these higherranked teams, and learn how to
win and compete at that level."
The Gators' inconsistency be-
gan in February when they would
take leaps forward then revert to
old mistakes.
After it won the first two games
of the season, UF suffered its first
loss -a crushing 18-5 blow from
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF midfielder Caroline Chesterman called the Gators' 14-9 loss to Ohio State last weekend "a heart-
breaker," and they'll get a chance to bounce back tonight against Oregon.North Carolina. The Gators won
the next game, but dropped the
next two games.
A three-game win streak fol-
lowed the losses, but UF's run had
to end, and Ohio State were the
one to do it.
Freshman midfielder Caro-
line Chesterman called the loss "a
heartbreaker" and said her team
allowed its opponent to capital-
ize on its mistakes, as the Gators
turned the ball over 17 times.
"It's frustrating not being able
to perform as well as you know
you are able to, but there's nothing
you can do except," Chesterman
said. "We're going to learn from
what happened against Ohio State,
fix those things and try to win
against Oregon."
In its losses, UF has especially
struggled on the offensive side.
The Gators have scored double-
digit goals just once in their losses,
something they have done in all
six of their wins.
Against the Ducks, O'Leary's
squad is going to have be ready to
handle the pressure on offense.
"We need to execute just a solid
offensive game plan, (because)
their defense slides very early to
double teams," she said. "Defen-
sively, we're going to need to come
out and play a solid defense. It's
just the same old thing that we try
to do in every game."
