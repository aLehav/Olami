After three paychecks bounced Fri-
day, some employees of a local Asian-
cuisine restaurant chain decided to go on strike and take it to the streets.
When workers at the 43rd Street 
Tasty Buddha tried to cash paychecks, they received a notice that insufﬁ  cient funds were in the payroll account, said Marissa Jane Pollack, a 21-year-old em-ployee. The ﬁ  rst employee’s check for about $340 bounced, she said.
Instead of working Saturday and 
Sunday, about eight employees stood at the intersection of Northwest 16th Av-enue and Northwest 43rd Street holding signs and handing out leaﬂ  ets to curious motorists. “Don’t give em your money until we get ours,” one of the signs read. 
Tasty Buddha franchise owner Park-
er Van Hart conﬁ  rmed that three of the 35 paychecks he wrote Wednesday did bounce on Friday.
Van Hart said that because of ear-
lier instances of check fraud, he opened a new payroll account. On Friday, that account had money to pay employees, but Van Hart said he thinks the bank teller didn’t know there was a second account. 
When the workers talked with Van 
Hart on Saturday morning, Pollack said he attributed the late paychecks to the company’s ﬁ  nancial state. 
“He was just giving us a load of 
malarkey about how we’re in debt a $100,000, which isn’t really that much,” she said. “You see how busy this place is all the time.”
Van Hart conﬁ  rmed the business has 
made about $500,000 in gross sales in 2013, and he said he took a loan of about $135,000 in 2012, which is about one-third paid.

This year’s Gator Growl will be a little different.
Organizers announced Sunday that The Fray, 
Sister Hazel and New Directions Veterans Choir will play the 90th Gator Growl on Nov. 8. Unlike most years, no comedian is scheduled to perform.
Students like UF sports management sophomore 
Chase Funk, 19, are speculating Tracy Morgan’s vul-garity during last year’s show inﬂ  uenced producers’ choices for 2013.
Funk also criticized the talent choices for Gator 
Growl.
“[Before,] you had household names like Dave 
Chappelle, Gabriel Iglesias, Daniel Tosh,” he said. “The Fray would have been really cool if it was 2008.”
Funk said Sister Hazel’s appearance will prob-
ably draw older alumni to Gator Growl. The Fray targets the younger — but still graduated — crowd. He said new and current students have little to look forward to for performances. 
Gator Growl public relations director Alyssa 
Fagien said although the alumni are heavily con-sidered, the interests of current UF students are still important when choosing talent.
“You are always going to have people that are 
disappointed,” she said. “I personally am really ex-cited for this year.”

UF linebacker Antonio Morrison was ar-
rested for the second time in ﬁ  ve weeks early 
Sunday morning after police say he taunted a police dog.
Will Muschamp issued a statement Sun-day afternoon via Twitter announcing that Morrison will be suspended from the team and blocked from playing at least two games at the beginning of the upcoming season.
“I am extremely disappointed in Antonio 
Morrison’s decision making,” Muschamp wrote.
Morrison was released Sunday at 1:01 p.m., 
said Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce spokes-man Art Forgey.
According to an Ala-
chua County Sheriff’s Of-ﬁ  ce report, Deputy William Arnold was investigating a suspicious vehicle at Scot-
tish Inns motel, 4341 SW 13th St., at about 3 a.m., when a group of men walked along the road past 
the parked patrol car.
Morrison, a 19-year-old UF sophomore, 
was one of them.As the patrol car’s emergency lights 
ﬂ  ashed, Morrison walked up to the open win-dow and made barking noises at K-9 Bear, ac-cording to the report.
Bear responded by barking, which divert-
ed the dog’s attention away from Arnold and the investigation, according to the report.
When Arnold asked Morrison to stand in 
front of the patrol car and tried to handcuff him, Morrison struggled.
Two other ofﬁ  cers arrived and helped UF linebacker suspended from team after second arrest in 5 weeks

LONDON — Bookies cashed 
in big Monday as thousands 
of Britons placed bets on what Prince William and his wife, Kate, would name their new-born child.
Ladbrokes took 50,000 bets 
in the hours after the Duchess of Cambridge went into labor Monday morning. Company spokesman Alex Donohue said the public rushed to put small amounts of money, such as a pound, on the royal infant’s name because they “want to be involved.”
“Never underestimate the 
British public’s obsession with the royal family,” he said. “This is such a big story. And besides, it’s summer. The weather is good.”
For much of the day, the 
money was on Alexandra for a girl and James or George for a boy. Late Monday, it was an-nounced that Kate had deliv-ered a son, though there was no word on the name.
Betting agency Coral de-
scribed it as the biggest non-sporting betting event in the company’s history.
“The whole world has been 
waiting for Kate to go into la-bor and now that she has, we have witnessed another betting frenzy,” said Nicola McGeady, spokeswoman for the firm, in the hours before the birth was announced.
The betting went well be-
yond the name. 
Paddy Power took bets on 
the color Kate’s sister, Pippa Middleton, will wear when she comes to visit.
Ladbrokes had odds of 33-to-
1 that the new heir, who would be third in line for the throne, would represent Great Britain at the Olympics. It’s not that far-fetched — equestrian ath-lete Zara Phillips, the queen’s granddaughter, won silver at the 2012 London Olympics.
The public may have to wait, 
though, to cash in their betting slips. It is not uncommon for royals to take their time nam-ing babies: Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip waited for a month in the case of Prince Charles.

Fisherman gets 230-lb tuna 
despite capsized boat 
LIHUE, Hawaii — A 
54-year-old fisherman is safe 
after his 14-foot boat capsized as he was landing a 230-pound tuna in the ocean off Hawaii.
The U.S. Coast Guard res-
cued Anthony Wichman on Friday after receiving a dis-tress call from his wife.
Wichman was fishing about 
10 miles southwest of Port Allen on the island of Kauai (kuh-WEYE’) Friday morning when he hooked the Ahi tuna. Coast Guard Lt. Jessica Mick-elson tells Hawaii News Now that Wichman was able to use his cellphone to call his wife for help.
The Coast Guard dis-
patched a helicopter to rescue Wichman. Friends arrived on another boat and were able to right Wichman’s boat. They towed it — and the fish — back to port.
Would-be mermaid banned 
from Fla. pool 
LITHIA, Fla. — A Florida 
woman has been banned from 
swimming in her communi-ty’s pool because she wants to wear a mermaid tail.
Jenna Conti, who lives in 
the FishHawk Ranch subdivi-sion, had been in the Aquatic Club pool with her custom-made tail once before with the staff’s approval. But last week, employees told her it violated a policy against swim fins. On Monday night, the FishHawk Community Development board voted to keep her out of the pool because of the swim fin policy.
The Tampa Bay Times re-
ports that Conti’s dream is to swim at the Florida Aquari-um, which features mermaid performers.
The full-time hair stylist 
hasn’t been a mermaid for very long. 
She and her 10-year-old 
son saw the mermaids at the Tampa Bay Renaissance Fair earlier this year, and she says she was “enthralled.”

Editors’ note: The primary source in this sto-
ry — named as “the physician” — requested anonymity from the writer because he claims his presence would be an unduly influence on the grants being proposed.
A local physician is involving the Gainesville 
City Commission in his fight to secure trans-
portation for safety-net clinic patients.
The safety-net clinics offer medical care for 
underserved residents, but they often have trouble getting there. The Relief & Assistance for Humanity by Muslim Americans Mercy Clinic, 5220 SW 13th St., and the Westside Samaritan Clinic, 10000 W. Newberry Road, are two of the clinics not serviced by RTS bus routes.
“We have patients that walk a mile and a 
half to get medical service,” said Brenda Be-lote, the volunteer director of operations at Westside Samaritan Clinic. “One night we had a gentlemen get to the clinic about an hour late. He was apologizing all over the place, and he said, ‘I had no clue it was that far.’ He was walking on crutches to get here.”
Most of the clinics use Solstas Lab Partners 
behind the North Florida Regional Medical Center, where the nearest bus stop is a quarter of a mile away.
“We are a city agency, and the locations of 
the two clinics are outside of our current ser-vice area and outside of the city limits,” said RTS spokesman Chip Skinner.
He said one of the issues in funding routes 
to the clinics is the location of the Americans with Disabilities Act service area, which is ap-proximately an additional quarter mile out-side of RTS’s fixed route service. If RTS were to extend these routes, it would cause problems with the ADA service area.
“So that’s really the issue: They’re outside 
the city limits; it would expand our ADA ser-vice area, and ultimately it’s about our fund-ing,” Skinner said.
The Safety Net Clinic Collaborative deter-
mined that transportation is a key deterrent to patients obtaining adequate medical care, the physician said. He applied for a $3,000 grant to offset the copay that patients are required to pay every time they ride shuttles through MV Transportation.
Jeffrey Hays, the Alachua County Growth 
Management transportation planning manag-er, said the department is working on a side-walk project for behind North Regional.
Many of the streets behind the hospital are 
privately owned, and the clinics are not in a location for bus routes to be convenient, Hays said.
“The issues are very understandable,” 
RAHMA Mercy Clinic Coordinator Livia Sura said.
The physician said there are 11 safety-net 
clinics in Alachua County. Some of the clinics are well-funded, have nice facilities and are open 40 hours weekly. But others suffer with tight budgets, operate in limited space and are only open one day a week.
“No two clinics are alike,” he said. “But one 
thing’s for sure — there will never be enough of these.”Physician seeks better access

along to.
However, some fans of other genres are already 
planning to skip the event.
Public relations freshman Nayara Brito-Es-
trada, 17, said she will be spending the four-day Homecoming weekend in Orlando at the Electric Daisy Carnival.
“Why would I go to Gator Growl when I 
could go to EDC?” she said. “It’s more expensive, yeah, but there are just so many more artists I like there.”
Fagien said that although EDC can be appeal-
ing, techno events happen frequently. Growl is only once a year.“It’s an easy choice between supporting the 
Gators and going to EDC,” she said.
But ticket prices have gone up — for students, 
it now costs $17 to attend Gator Growl. Guests tickets are $27.
Producer Megan Harmon said the $2 price raise 
was routine. She said people should know they’re paying for an excellent concert — one they’ll have a good time attending.
UF pre-vet student Will Smith, 20, said after 
last year’s “Tracy Morgan debacle,” the junior was skeptical the announced acts would persuade him to buy a ticket. 
But when he learned The Fray was performing, 
he said he knew the $17 would be worth it.
“The Fray was huge at one point, and I really 
like their songs,” Smith said. “I’m going just to see them.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 23, 2013

However, the group of employ-
ees plan to continue protesting, Pol-lack said. 
They compiled a list of demands 
including fixing a kitchen air condi-tioner and introducing a zero-toler-ance policy for sexual harassment and bullying. 
“We realized this is an oppor-
tunity to address other concerns,” Pollack said, also citing sanitation issues. In a statement on the company’s 
Facebook page on Saturday, Van Hart wrote that “the other com-plaints made regarding sexual ha-rassment and dangerous working conditions are complete crap.”
He included his phone number 
in the statement and invited ques-tions from the public.
“My business and the way I treat those around me is an open book,” he wrote. 
Joe Richard, a union organizer 
who has represented other restau-rant workers, said he is negotiating with Van Hart about the employees’ demands.
They have prepared a statement 
to file with the National Labor Rela-tions Board, but as of Monday, Pol-lack said it was unfiled.
In the meantime, Van Hart said 
he is unclear on what the employees want him to do. 
Pollack said negotiations will 
continue this week.

The Gator Nation is everywhere — 
maybe even in Angangueo, Mexico.
Gainesville may soon pair with the 
Central Mexican city to become the first 
international Butterfly City connection.
The relationship would include corre-
spondence between the cities to exchange cultural elements and relate through a common interest in butterflies.
“We envision the project as ... a way to 
link elementary schools in the two coun-tries through a pen-pal program,” said Peter Johnson, one of the founders of the Butterfly Education Project. “I haven’t met many people who are anti-butterfly. They seem to be a common ground for people of all political and social views.”
A Butterfly City is one that protects, 
promotes and preserves butterflies and other urban wildlife, according to the Butterfly Education Project website.
Gainesville became the nation’s first 
Butterfly City in 2009. 
Johnson and fellow founder, Gabe 
Hillel, both butterfly enthusiasts, first started the project after working with stu-dents at the Caring and Sharing Learning School in Gainesville, where they found that butterflies were an educational tool.
“It changed their perspective on what 
was interesting in their world,” Johnson said. “It increased their awareness of what was around them.”
The two men said the next step is for 
city hall to send a letter to Angangueo to establish an official relationship between the two cities.
“It’s not a question of if — it’s a ques-
tion of when and how,” Hillel said.Butterfly program could

UF Health plans to open a new 
emergency clinic for residents of 
northwest Gainesville and Ala-chua County. 
Officials will celebrate the 
opening of the UF Health Shands Emergency Center – Springhill, 8491 NW 39th Ave., Wednesday with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and building tours. It’s scheduled to open officially in early August, according to a news release.
UF Health Chief Operations Officer and Senior Vice President Ed Jimenez said the opening of new department is in response to the town’s population growth.
“We’ve seen an increasing 
demand in emergency centers in this area,” he said. “So open-ing this department is another piece to other emergency depart-ments.”
The clinic will be open all day, 
every day.Jimenez said that as a whole, 
the new center cost about $10 million, which includes purchas-ing the property, equipment and hiring employees. 
The emergency center is 
equipped with 10 treatment spaces for patients, an on-site lab and diagnostic radiology services including X-ray and CT imaging systems, according to the release. Physicians and nurses trained in emergency medicine will staff the 8,500-square-foot building.
Health science senior Adrian 
Taylor, 21, said he’s glad to see the new center because it will provide something positive for the community. 
“This does not only provide 
jobs for UF graduates,” Taylor said, “but shows the benefits the community gets when UF ad-vances.”

Will the series be
out of this world?
This year’s Comic-Con International: San Diego brought 
with it loads of exciting news and trailers, magniﬁ  cent costumes and a whopping crowd of more than 130,000.
Although we could talk about the exciting news that 
Batman and Superman may soon have a movie together or stir up the debate about the upcoming “Ender’s Game” movie and author Orson Scott Card’s homophobic views, we will instead turn our attention to matters of a more cosmic signiﬁ  cance. 
Science fans in San Diego and all over the globe went 
bonkers as Fox revealed a trailer for the new “Cosmos” series at the convention. The series is a reboot of the 33-year-old series written and hosted by Carl Sagan. The new series will be hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson, who spoke at UF in the Spring. 
The series, called “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,” is being 
produced, among others, by Seth MacFarlane of “Family Guy” fame and Sagan’s widow Ann Druyan, who helped Sagan write the original series.
The trailer promises an epic voyage to the stars and beyond 
— and also through our own history.
Despite the trailer’s epic feel, we hope the original spirit 
of “Cosmos” is retained. The ﬁ  rst series, titled “Cosmos: A Personal Voyage,” emphasized the importance of maintaining the cosmic perspective.
What is the cosmic perspective? It’s a way of viewing the 
world that is sure to change your life. In Sagan’s own famous words, we are made of “star-stuff.” Every atom in our body was at some point dwelling within the nuclear furnace of a star billions of years ago. We are star-stuff contemplating the stars: the cosmos studying itself.
Sagan emphasized the view of humanity as a single species 
and the planet as a single unit. Sagan said, “Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.” 
Such views were bold for their time. “Cosmos” was 
released when the United States and the Soviet Union, in Druyan’s words, “held the whole planet in a perpetual hostage crisis.” “Cosmos” made an effort to provide insight into the histories and beliefs of many cultures, exposing the elegance and beauty behind them.
In a way, he taught us that science isn’t cold. The history 
and revelations of science are just as human as we are.
Some may be doubtful of how the series will turn out 
because Fox is the main channel carrying the series. But given how hard Druyan has worked in protecting Sagan’s image, we doubt the integrity of “Cosmos” will be an issue.
Besides, maybe “Cosmos” is exactly the kind of thing Fox 
viewers need to see.Race-baiting and arguments that appeal to emotion 
have been a ﬁ  xture of left- and right-wing media outlets for a very long time, but never has race-baiting 
been more apparent than during the coverage of the State of Florida v. Zimmerman trial. The laundry list of emotional arguments include dubbing Zimmerman a white Hispanic, President Barack Obama’s statements regarding similarities between himself and Trayvon Martin and the onset of blogs, such as Public Shaming. Proponents of these racist sentiments have also attempted to change the meaning of racism, making racism applicable only to an afﬂ  uent race of people oppressing non-afﬂ  uent races — as if class structure were static and based on race rather than one’s level of afﬂ  uence.
The theory of white privilege was invented by the 
sociologist and historian W.E.B. Du Bois in 1935. His argument was, despite the similar disposition of lower class blacks and whites, it seemed that whites were granted a position of privilege in the public sphere that their black counterparts did not experience. Du Bois also believed in the racist theory of Pan-Africanism, which states all people of African descent shared a common destiny. Regarding whites, Du Bois stated, “they were admitted freely with all classes of white people to public functions, public parks and the best schools. The police were drawn from their ranks, and the courts, dependent upon their votes, treated them with such leniency as to encourage lawlessness.” 
All of the above privileges have one common thread: 
They were all tied to government programs during the time of Jim Crow laws. The police departments, public schools and public parks were all owned by the same government that implemented the blatantly racist Jim Crow laws. Once this fact is taken into account, it becomes apparent how white supremacy became an institutionalized part of society in the 1930s. But with the advent equally racist afﬁ  rmative action laws, using this instance as proof of white privilege would be in bad taste.
If white privilege and white supremacy are byproducts 
of institutionalized racism, what would afﬁ  rmative action in police departments, ﬁ  re departments and institutions of higher learning be considered? The police department of Dayton, Ohio, actually lowered test standards for its black applicants in 2011, which gave black applicants an unfair advantage over non-black applicants. Afﬁ  rmative action forces both private and public 
institutions to hire women and minority members despite their qualiﬁ  cations, which are examples of institutionalized racism in favor of nonwhites. These occurrences are contradictory to white privilege theory, yet equally racist.
The historical context of racism in America has become 
the foundation upon which race-baiters and proponents of white privilege theory base their arguments. If proponents of privilege theory are to suggest that only those with the power to oppress are capable of racism, the argument is also implying only a certain race is capable of racism. The heart of this argument is racist because it implies only people of a certain race are capable of possessing certain traits.
Blogs such as Public Shaming on Tumblr have attempted 
to propel a racial divide in the wake of the Zimmerman verdict by documenting racist tweets aimed at Martin. This is a prime example of race-baiting because the blog shows roughly 13 tweets — assuming 13 tweets are an accurate representation of an American population of 313.9 million.
Obama even joined in on the race-baiting by stating Martin 
could have been his son. Obama should also try and tell all the parents of brown children killed in his drone strikes that those children could have been his as well.
White privilege believers should recognize how 
hypocritical and outdated Du Bois’ theory of white privilege is and stop employing emotional arguments to defend it. I would hold these race-baiters accountable for the fact that racism has yet to be eradicated.

During Summer B, I’ve been taking a course 
about the cultural impact of video games. The ﬁ  rst classes were more about history 
than impact, showing how games got to be such an important part of our culture in the ﬁ  rst place.
Recently the course reached the point in history 
in which games like “Mortal Kombat” inspired U.S. Senate hearings on violence in video games. The hearings eventually resulted in the 1994 creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, known better as simply the ESRB. 
Last year alone, the ESRB rated more than 1,200 
games. Of those, more than half came with parental guidance, from Everyone 10+ to Mature. This does not even include games with an Adults Only rat-ing.
A survey examined about 1,200 surveys of video 
game players ages 6-44 and their parents, ﬁ  nding that “82 percent of ‘gamer’ parents were familiar with the ESRB rating guidelines, 7 percent more than the game-playing children themselves.” A Kotaku article on the survey goes on to say that “70 percent [of parents] pay attention to it [the ratings system] when purchasing a game for their children, with 62 percent indicating that they actively research the games.”
Another survey is referenced in the ESRB’s own 
site, this one from May and June 2012. The number of parents aware of the ESRB went up 3 percent, while the 70 percent mark stayed the same. The only other important piece of info is 88 percent of those polled feel the ESRB is helpful in some capacity.
All of this culminates 
in the idea the ESRB is effective. Not only is it effective in rating games, 
but the group also has done a good job in making parents aware of its function. But the problem lies in the complementary statistics. If 70 percent of par-ents pay attention, why do 30 percent not? If 85 per-cent are aware of the ESRB, what prevents the other 15 percent from knowing? This should concern both the ESRB and the gaming community as a whole.
As long as games are merely considered as a via-
ble scapegoat for causing violent behavior, the solu-tion to combating that assumption lies in the spread of information. If 99 percent of parents are aware of the ESRB guidelines and follow them religiously, some will still claim the 1 percent not reached is the source of deviants. Sadly, it is clear even if the mark of 99 percent was ever reached, it would not change the minds of those so ﬁ  rmly entrenched in their ways.

HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org
The author of the “Harry Potter” series 
has traded in writing about magic for 
mystery and murder, and many local J.K. Rowling fans are reacting enthusiastically to the news of her latest work. 
Joanne Kathleen Rowling published 
the crime novel “The Cuckoo’s Calling” in April using the pen name Robert Galbraith. 
The Sunday Times of London revealed 
Rowling as the author of the novel July 14.
Rowling’s talent for nuance and detail could help make her successful in a new genre, said Elli Langford, a 25-year-old freelance writer and member of the UF Quidditch team. 
“The ability to create 
characters people care about and want to read 
about is how you sell books,” she said. “Twist endings and being mysterious while making so many things work together.  What she is good at is perfect for the mystery genre.”
Rowling wrote under a new pseudonym 
to test herself, Langford said. 
“Like all writers, she wants to know if she’s any good and what people will think of her work,” she said. “It’s almost impossible because people will read anything she publishes.”
UF classical studies senior Tim Derrick, 
21, agreed.
“I’d probably read it just because she 
wrote it,” he said. “ She’s always been great at building an unbelievable world.” 
David Diemes, a 24-year-old UF biology 
senior and member of the UF Quidditch team, added that by using a pseudonym, Rowling allows readers to experience her work in a new way.
“She may have done this as an 
experiment to see if her new work could be noticed without her big name clouding the opinions of readers,” Diemes said. “I don’t blame her for wanting to try something new. She doesn’t need the money, so she’s clearly doing it for the love of writing.”
“The Cuckoo’s Calling” is unavailable 
in local bookshops, but chain merchants Barnes & Noble and Books-A-Million have the book in stock.
The Alachua County Library District 
owns 29 copies, but as of press time, all were checked out and 126 holds were pending, according to its online catalog.
When Diemes reads the book, he said he 
anticipates having a hard time separating the world of Harry Potter from the crime novel.
“She moved on to other projects, and 
that’s part of the fun of being a reader,” he said, “not knowing when you are going to ﬁ  nd the next gem in your collection.”

FIRE JOE MORGAN
 Will Muschamp shouldn’t kick Anto-
nio Morrison off the football team.
    After watching the video of 
Morrison’s Sunday morning arrest obtained by The Gainesville Sun, I have no issue apologizing to Morrison for my rush to judg-ment with my Sunday column, “Muschamp should kick Morrison off team” at alligator-Sports.org.
    I assumed the worst following the middle 
linebacker’s second arrest in ﬁ  ve weeks, and I agree with Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell that the incident likely warranted no more than a warning.
    However, I stand by my previous point 
that Morrison’s actions on Sunday morning were both irresponsible and selﬁ  sh. Also, I still believe that Morrison should miss more than the announced suspension of “at least two games.”
    Morrison missing the Miami game may 
be some cause for concern, but is anybody losing sleep over how Toledo will attack the Florida defense on Aug. 31? I didn’t think so.
    According to the video, Morrison lied to 
the arresting ofﬁ  cer by denying he went to school at the University of Florida.
    First, why would you ever lie to a police 
ofﬁ  cer? That alone is a serious offense.
    But more speciﬁ  cally, why would Mor-
rison lie to a police ofﬁ  cer only ﬁ  ve weeks removed from his June 16 arrest for battery? They have you in their database, so lying about your identity just makes it worse.
    Why dig an even deeper hole for your-
self?
    Secondly, Morrison being out in 
Gainesville after 2 a.m. is simply inexcus-able, especially considering his previous ar-rest. Once you ﬁ  nd yourself in Muschamp’s doghouse, why would you even consider doing anything to further violate his trust?
    Even if the arresting ofﬁ  cers were over-
zealous in their arrest of Morrison on Sun-day morning, I’m sure Muschamp was not pleased to hear Morrison was out that late.
    And ﬁ  nally, why would Morrison bark at 
a police dog?
    Granted, he probably didn’t think he 
would be arrested for wooﬁ  ng, but I can’t imagine he thought that the ofﬁ  cers wouldn’t care that someone was distracting their dog.    Why would he even go near a 
police car after his June 16 arrest?
    If only Morrison had some sort 
of Jiminy Cricket on his shoulder screaming, “NO! NO! NO!”
    I have never been arrested, but 
I imagine spending the night in jail is a humbling experience. Hell, I’ve received a couple of speeding tickets that turned me into a more cautious driver for several weeks afterward.
    Had I been forced to answer to an upset Muschamp for those mistakes, I might have shredded my driver’s license and vowed to never oper-ate a motor vehicle ever again.
    That’s what bothers me most 
about Morrison’s arrest.
    I don’t know how the meeting 
between Muschamp and Mor-rison went following the June 
16 arrest, but I doubt Coach Boom merely slapped him on the wrist and said, “Keep your nose clean, kid.”    Why would Morrison choose to be out on 
the town way past an appropriate hour so soon after screwing up in such a major and public fashion?
    Doesn’t he have a Netﬂ  ix account like ev-
ery other college student?
    After his ﬁ  rst arrest, Morrison should 
have played it safe like the rest of us by watching “Arrested Development” for the umpteenth time. Even if he isn’t a fan of the Bluth family, “The Avengers” is on Netﬂ  ix now. Everybody loves that movie!
    Online streaming aside, Morrison clearly 
underestimated the gravity of his ﬁ  rst arrest by continuing the lifestyle that got him into trouble in the ﬁ  rst place.
    Morrison’s behavior was selﬁ  sh and dis-
respectful to both his coaches and his team-mates.
    He needs to realize how his actions affect 
the people he works with every day — both the Netﬂ  ix subscribers and the guys who manage to hang out in Gainesville without punching bouncers and barking at police dogs.
    Morrison may have the talent to step in 
for Jon Bostic at middle linebacker, but the leadership role the Chicago Bears’ second-round NFL Draft selection left behind re-mains vacant.
    Maybe the 8 p.m. curfew assigned to Mor-
rison as a condition of his release will do him some good. Perhaps he can spend the extra time watching ﬁ  lm or, I don’t know, sleep-ing.
    I would offer to pay for a month of his Net-
ﬂ  ix subscription, but I don’t want to commit an NCAA violation. It’s only $8 per month, Antonio. Besides, I think they give you a free trial for your ﬁ  rst month of membership.
    Again, I apologize to Morrison for rush-
ing to judgment, but regardless of the situ-ation surrounding his arrest, he was clearly out of line. He had no excuse to put himself in that situation, especially considering his previous arrest.
    Maybe two arrests will knock some sense 
into him. Maybe not.
    But if Morrison treats this arrest like his 
ﬁ  rst, I can’t imagine a scenario where Mus-champ would tolerate a third run-in with the law.

Defensive tackle decommits
Four-star recruit Anthony Moten decommitted from 
UF on Saturday. Rivals.com ranks Moten as the No. 12 defensive tackle in the 2014 class.Fomer UF golfer Tyler McCumber won his ﬁ  rst professional tournament on Sunday. Read the story on page 16.  ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 In 2012, Florida relied on a top-tier de-
fense to carry the team into bowl season. 
The offense struggled and ﬁ  nished 104th in the country.
  This year, the offense has the potential 
for much improvement.
  Coach Will Muschamp said he hopes a 
new offensive style will bring some more success to the unit.
  “We will do some more tempo on of-
fense this year,” Muschamp said at South-eastern Conference Media Days on July 16. “The more opportunity you give an offense, the more chances they have to score.”
  The Gators’ young offensive squad  
gained a year of experience, and Florida brought in eight offensive skill players. Some of the new recruits will look to make a quick impact.
  UF brought in two running backs, 
Adam Lane and Kelvin Taylor. Taylor is expected to ﬁ  ll the role that expected start-er Matt Jones played last year. Jones ran for 275 yards on 52 attempts while backing up then-starter Mike Gillislee.   Muschamp said he thinks Jones is 
primed for a big season and that he is ex-pected to carry the offense.
  “Mike Gillislee was our ﬁ  rst thousand-
yard rusher since [2004],” Muschamp said. “That’s not going to be the exception any more at Florida. That’s going to be the norm.”
  But not all of the new faces working on 
the Gators offense will be covered with facemasks. Muschamp brought in former Kentucky head coach Joker Phillips to coach wide receivers.
  “Really pleased with the addition of 
Joker Phillips,” Muschamp said. “(He’s) a guy who played the position, coached the position for over years.”
  The receiving corps struggled last year. 
Tight end Jordan Reed led the team in re-ceiving yards with 559. The top wideout, Quinton Dunbar, ﬁ  nished the year with 383 yards – 35th in the SEC.
  But this year, Florida adds highly touted 
recruits Demarcus Robinson and Ahmad Fulwood. Muschamp also said defensive back Loucheiz Purifoy will play a role at receiver. Purifoy practiced at the position in the spring. 
  “I think it’s a good group top to bot-
tom,” Driskel said. 
“They’ve done a ton of work this off-
season, and I’m looking forward to them playing … They’re tired of hearing they’re no good.”

stein@alligator.org.  Additions to offense look to bolster upcoming squad

WHAT TO EXPECT
 As you may or may not know, college sports are divided 
into conferences. Florida is a member of the Southeast-ern Conference (a.k.a. the SEC), and Gators fans will 
not let you forget it.
Y  ou’ll probably hear the “S-E-C” chant at The Swamp 
whenever Florida plays a non-conference opponent, especially Florida State.
  First off, there are 14 teams in the conference. They are – take 
a deep breath – Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, LSU, Mississippi State, Missouri, Ole Miss, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas A&M and Vanderbilt. Basically what would exist if the Confederacy decided to start a league.
    SEC schools have won the last seven national champion-
ships. Alabama has three of them, Florida has two, and LSU and Auburn each have one.
  Texas A&M and Missouri are the two newest schools to the 
conference. Both joined after leaving the Big 12 last year. The Aggies made a smooth transition. The Tigers – not so much. 
  Alabama is really, really good. They’re the closest thing to 
a dynasty in college football today. Nick Saban is their head coach. If you ask most rival fans (or UF offensive line coach Tim Davis), the ‘B’ should be a ‘T.’
Georgia is also very good. The Bulldogs are arguably the 
Gators’ biggest rivals, and the two play each other every sea-son in “neutral” Jacksonville. Senior quarterback Aaron Mur-ray and sophomore running backs Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall lead the Georgia offense. Gurley and Marshall (collectively known as “Gurshall”) are so fast, they could star in one of those AT&T commercials. Fast is better.    
Make sure you keep your Bull-
dogs and Tigers straight, because there are a bunch of them. Georgia and Mississippi State are both Bull-dogs. Auburn, LSU and Missouri all 
are Tigers. But in Gainesville, when someone says “Bulldogs,” you can generally assume they mean Georgia. If they say “Ti-gers,” they probably mean LSU.  But if one of the others is on the schedule, all bets are off. 
South Carolina is also a team to watch. They brought in for-
mer Florida coach Steve Spurrier after he bolted from the NFL and he turned the program into a powerhouse. 
  Arkansas and Auburn both have generally been pretty 
good recently. Both were terrible last year. Look up former Ar-kansas coach John L. Smith for proof. Spoiler: He did so poorly, he went from an SEC school to Division II Fort Lewis College in one year.
    Tennessee is historically a very good program, but it’s been 
somewhere between mediocre and terrible for the better part of the last decade. Peyton Manning played there, but not much else has happened since. Tennessee is known as the Volunteers, but their mascot is a dog. Go ﬁ  gure.
  When the Vols come to town, they try to drill their theme 
song, “Rocky Top,” into your head so you’ll remember them as they march towards their inevitable sub-.500 ﬁ  nish.  
  Then there’s Ole Miss. You know, that school from “The 
Blind Side.” The school is really the University of Mississippi, but that’s boring. Just call it Ole Miss. 
  The Rebels were really good a long time ago, but they 
haven’t won a conference title since the Johnson administra-tion (Lyndon, not Andrew, despite the nickname). However, they brought in some top players in their last recruiting class, so who knows what could happen?
  I feel like I’m forgetting someone? Oh, right ... Kentucky and 
Vanderbilt.
  Kentucky is just bad. The Wildcats should really stick to 
basketball. Florida has beaten Kentucky 26 straight times. Kentucky has been so bad, Trey Burton scored six times in one game against them in 2010.
  Vanderbilt was almost as bad. They’ve lost 22 straight to 
UF. They’re usually the conference punching bag, but coach James Franklin has turned Vandy around – he won nine games last year. And the Commodores have the coolest nickname in the SEC, so they have that going for them. They’re pretty smart, and they like to point it out while the team is down 20 points.

 Last night, Major League Baseball sus-
pended Milwaukee Brewers outﬁ  eld-er Ryan Braun for 65 games – the rest 
of the season – because of the outﬁ  elder’s steroid use. 
  My response was a resounding: “So 
what?”
  Braun is a lying cheater, obviously. In 
fact, he’s worse than that. When he tested positive in 2011, he challenged his sentence and won. In the process, he dragged peo-ple’s names through the mud. 
  Braun doesn’t deserve this penalty. He 
deserves worse.
  He committed two crimes against base-
ball and is basically paying for one and a half.
  A ﬁ  rst-time offense typically costs 50 
games. A second violation is 100 games. Braun got caught and lied about it to ev-eryone. He’s getting off easy.  And does it even matter that he’s miss-
ing the rest of year? 
  As of this writing, the Brewers are mired 
in last place, 18.5 games behind the ﬁ  rst-place Cardinals. They’re done for the year.
  Milwaukee is going to ﬁ  nish the season 
quietly, and then it will get a disgraced and well-rested Braun back for 2014.
  After seeing what’s happened, there’s 
not a ton of disincentive for other players to juice. 
  Look at it this way: Yeah, Braun is dis-
graced, and yeah, he’s missing 65 games. So what? He’s still a multi-millionaire and he’s still owed plenty of money as part of his $105 million contract.
  Think about it. Honestly, if someone 
told you that if you take some shots, you could make millions more than you would have normally, would you do it? 
  Regardless of whether you would or not, it would make you think.
  MLB needs to 
get tough. Penal-ties have gotten stiffer over the years, but clear-ly it’s still not enough.
  Increase the 
penalties. Fail a test, you miss a season. Fail a second time, you’re done. 
  Enough with any kind of leniency.   Baseball can make you rich and famous. 
Baseball can make you a household name. You shouldn’t get to cheat the game and get off scot free.
  In my opinion, the jury is still out on 
the Steroid Era. A lot of players were do-ing steroids at the time, and they weren’t tested. It’s hard to differentiate juiced numbers from the real ones. Yeah, hitters were on steroids, but so were the pitchers they faced. 
  It kind of cancels out.  But now there’s extensive testing. Now 
we’ve ﬁ  rmly established that using steroids is not acceptable. And yet players continue to use.
  Maybe MLB should add a clause to ev-
ery contract. If the player tests positive, they have to donate a percentage of their future baseball earnings to charity. I don’t know the legality of it, and the Players As-sociation would ﬁ  ght it tooth and nail, but it sounds good in theory.
  And maybe a shot to the wallet will 
make players think twice before they turn to the needle.

  UF will be well-represented at this year’s U.S. 
Open Championships, which begin on July 30. 
  Eight Gators swimmers posted qualifying times 
at the Southern Zone South Sectional Regional or 
at previous qualifying competitions. 
  Among the eight Gators heading to Irvine, Ca-
lif., for the U.S. Open are four All-Americans, who combined for 13 All-American honors during the 2012-13 season. 
Headlining the group is two-time South African 
Olympian and 10-time All-American junior Sebas-tien Rousseau. 
  He qualiﬁ  ed for the 200-meter freestyle (1:48.69), 
100-meter butterﬂ  y (54.17), 200-meter individual medley (1:59.55), 200-meter backstroke (2:02.77) and 100-meter backstroke (57.34).
  Rousseau will be accompanied by sophomore 
Matthew Curby, junior Brad deBorde, freshman Arthur Frayler, freshman Ryan Rosenbaum and sophomore Billy Silva from the men’s team. Fresh-man Lindsey McKnight and sophomore Jordan Smith will represent the women’s team.
  Curby, a four-time All-American, made the cut 
for the 200 free (1:53.86), 100 ﬂ  y (55.74), 100 back (56.83) and 200 IM (2:04.10). Silva will be swim-ming the same three events he did at the 2012 USA Olympic Team Trials, the 400 IM (4:25.67), 400-me-ter freestyle (3:59.02) and 1,500-meter freestyle (15:46.70).
  DeBorde, UF’s 50-me-
ter freestyle record holder and 14-time All-American, qualiﬁ  ed for the 100-meter 
freestyle (49.94) and 50 free (22.76), and Smith’s time of 4:54.68 at Sectionals earned her a spot in the 400 IM.
  Three Gators freshmen are headed to the U.S. 
Open. Although McKnight is an All-American who qualiﬁ  ed for 200 free (2:02.58) and 200 IM (2:17.53), and Frayler who made cut times for the 1500 free (15:04.69), 800 free (8:02.01) and 400 free (3:53.69) has competed at Olympic Team Trials and Rosen-baum is coming off a career-best swim in the 400 free (4:01.81), the US Open Championships will likely be the biggest stage they’ve competed on.

  Former Florida golfer Tyler 
McCumber won his ﬁ  rst pro-
fessional tournament on Sun-day. After shooting the second-lowest score of any golfer in the ﬁ  nal round of the Florida Open Championship in Vero Beach, McCumber ﬁ  nished with a 204 (-12) overall. 
  He took the lead on Hole 6 
and did not give it back for the rest of the day. After a par on Hole 10, McCumber notched four straight birdies. 
  The streak was enough to 
fend off contender Nyasha Mauchaza, who ﬁ  nished sec-ond. McCumber’s birdie on Hole 14 concluded a stretch of six birdies in nine holes. At one point, he held a ﬁ  ve-shot lead over Mauchaza. Mauc-haza was not only McCumber’s closest competition on the lea-derboard, but also his playing partner during the ﬁ  nal round. Mauchaza carded a 206 (-10) for the tournament.
  McCum-
ber excelled on the longest holes at the Quail Valley 
Golf Club, shooting  three under in the ﬁ  nal round on the 
club’s four par-5s. Mauchaza was unable to make the most of his par-5s, shooting one over on them during Sunday’s round. 
  McCumber wasn’t the only 
Gator in the ﬁ  eld. Former UF golfer and Gainesville native Tyler Rucarean also partici-pated in the tournament. He withdrew from the tournament midway through the second round.
