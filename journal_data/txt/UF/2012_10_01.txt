As Pedro Bravo remained in Alachua 
County Jail accused of a murder in con-
nection to Christian Aguilar’s disappear-ance, police documents released Satur-day shed more light on what happened the day Aguilar went missing.
Aguilar, an 18-year-old biomedical 
engineering freshman from Miami, has not been seen since Sept. 20.
Over the weekend, a judge charged 
Bravo with murder and denied him bond.
Police said Aguilar’s body had not 
been recovered, but a Gainesville Police arrest report revealed what Bravo, an 18-year-old Santa Fe College student, told ofﬁ  cers in an interview a day after Aguilar’s disappearance.
During questioning, Bravo said he 
and Aguilar met on campus on Sept. 20 
and drove to Best Buy on Southwest Archer Road so Aguilar could buy Kanye West’s new 
“Cruel Summer” al-bum.
A store surveillance 
photo released Tuesday showed that Aguilar was last seen at about 
3 p.m. that day.
Bravo said he and Aguilar drove 
around the city until they got into an argument about Aguilar’s girlfriend, Erika Friman, 18, who previously dated Bravo.Details surface about day

UF received a $5 million grant from the 
U.S. Department of Education’s Ofﬁ  ce of Spe-
cial Education Programs to establish a center to support the development of school and district leaders in serving students with dis-abilities.
The Collaboration for Educator Develop-
ment, Accountability , and Reform center will be located in Norman Hall. It is scheduled to open in January.
Co-principal investigator and UF special education professor Paul Sindelar said the center will work with states in revising stan-dards for classroom teachers, special educa-tion teachers and other school leaders, align-ing preparation programs with new standards and evaluating the programs. The grant will provide $5 million each year for ﬁ  ve years, Sindelar said.
Each year, states will undergo an applica-
tion process in order to receive assistance. Principal investigator and UF special educa-tion professor Mary Brownell said the current system is not set up to serve students with dis-abilities as well as it could.
“They are probably in many ways the 
most vulnerable school population; they per-form more poorly than another subgroup of students,” Brownell said. “With really good instruction, they can really achieve a lot of dif-ferent things, including college.”

Sarah Scales convinced her husband they 
should spend a night out downtown, but she 
left her heels at home.
Scales, a UF alumna, was one of about 200 
people Friday evening who donned shorts, sneakers and shades for a 5K race with beer at the ﬁ  nish line.
“Our son is at his grandmother’s house, 
so we’re looking for a nice grown-up evening with the beer,” she said.
The Gainesville House of Beer hosted the 
Gainesville Beer Run 5K. Race director and event coordinator Dan Phillips said 235 people registered for the run.
There were ﬁ  ve kegs waiting for the run-ners at $130 a piece. About 70 people showed up to watch the run and enjoy frothy craft beer, said Erin Cosgrove, assistant race director.
Phillips said the total cost of the event was 
abound $6,000 or $7,000.
After a 10-second countdown, Mayor Craig 
Lowe ﬁ  red a starting gun, and the racers took off.
The course started and ended at Southwest 
First Street. Some parts of the course were changed to the sidewalk at the last minute to adjust to the RTS bus schedule, which had been rerouted due to the Gainesville Pride Fes-tival and Parade.Runners raced for kegs at 5KSEE MURDER, PAGE 5

Oct. 4, 1977: “Klan krasher” Buddy Cocheran, 
who gained notoriety by running his car into a plat-
form at a KKK rally the summer of 1977, and George Allison, who organized an effort to stop a planned Independence Day KKK march in Ohio, were slated to address a Revolutionary Student Brigade rally. 
Oct. 3, 1988: Gainesville’s mayor-commissioner 
led a seven-day delegation to Novorossiisk, Gaines-ville’s sister city in the Soviet Union, to strengthen trade agreements between the two countries. Soviet officials were interested in a variety of joint ventures with Gainesville, including opening an American pizza restaurant in Novorossiisk and a Black Sea res-taurant in Gainesville. 
Oct. 1, 1999: UF student Wendy Steinberg won 
$10,000 on “The Price Is Right.” After telling one of the producers that she planned her class schedule around the show, she was chosen to be a part of the audience and later told to “come on down.” She bid the closest to the actual retail price of a hockey equip-ment set, giving her a chance to come on stage for the game called Grand Slam in which she won the $10,000. She made it all the way to the Showcase Showdown.
Oct. 1, 2003: The UF College of Pharmacy and 
the University of Edinburgh in Scotland established a long-distance education program to meet a world-wide demand for forensic science professionals. The partnership allows students from both universities to access courses unavailable to them in their respective countries. The program allowed 75 UF students to gain international experience.

� THE HONORS PROGRAM WILL HOST 
EVENTS ALL WEEK.
MARISA ROSS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The UF Honors Program is celebrating novels 
like “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “The Perks of Being a 
Wallflower” and “Kite Runner” as part of Banned Books Week on campus.
The series of events, which began Sunday, recog-
nizes the freedom of reading for the 30th anniver -
sary of national Banned Books Week. They include a showing of “Easy A” and a speech by the president of the national Kurt Vonnegut Society.
V onnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five” was the 
Honors Program common reading selection this past summer. UF Honors Program Director Kevin Knudson said a school district in Missouri banned the book last year after one parent wrote a letter of complaint.
“That got me thinking,” Knudson said. “Why 
would you ban a pretty inoffensive book? A typical episode of ‘Jersey Shore’ is much more offensive.”
Ben Swerdlown, a 19-year-old materials science 
engineering sophomore, said banned books often teach valuable lessons.
“They should look at the ratio between material 
that might require censorship versus literary merit,” he said.
Knudson said the reason there are complaints 
about controversial texts is a control issue. But he said banned books will always resurface.
“Life is four-letter words, sex and religion,” he 
said. “And if we don’t talk about these things as a culture, we can’t come to some resolution.”UF celebrates

The glossy leaves of the cor-
al ardisia gleamed in the mid-
morning light as UF second-year pharmacy student Tina Chen yanked it from the ground in one swift motion.
The plant, known for its 
decorative red berries, was the focus of an invasive plant pull at Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park on Saturday.
“If you don’t pull on it by its 
roots, it will grow back,” said Chen, 23.
About 20 volunteers gath-
ered at the park to remove the plants, which are a big prob-lem on the prairie because they cover vast areas and choke out native plants, said Heather Van Heuveln, UF alumna and park volunteer through Ameri-Corps.
“The coral ardisia shades 
and crowds out everything,” she said.
With its waxy leaves and red 
berries, the Japanese plant was brought to Florida to be used as decoration, she said. The berries have about an 80 to 90 percent germination rate, allowing the plant to spread and take over areas of the park with ease.
“When the seeds fall off the 
plants, it creates a carpet,” she said.
Park Service Specialist Am-
ber Roux said events like this are important to educate and show people the harm invasive plants can do to the natural en-vironment.
“This event gives and spreads awareness and removes plants like this,” she said. “It’s so important.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2012

� ABOUT 100 VENDORS 
CAME TO THE FESTIVAL. 
JEWEL MIDELIS

Igor Ignatovich stood in a blue 
and white dress, held a tiny dog in 
a basket and waved to people gath-ered along University Avenue as his float drove along. He stood with the Tin Man by his side on the United Church of Gainesville’s float dur -
ing Saturday’s parade for this year’s Gainesville Pride Festival.
The festival, which included 
the parade and an event on the Bo Diddley Community Plaza, was hosted by the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida. Thousands of people attended the festival on the plaza, which includ-ed about 100 vendors from the area.
Ryan Holman, who dressed as 
the Tin Man for his church’s “Over the Rainbow” theme, said he loved being in the parade.
“It was great,” he said. “It’s the 
coming together of straight and gay.”
The parade included Boy Scouts, 
Gainesville High School students, dancers and other political and re-ligious groups, who paraded from Seventh Street to the Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
On the plaza, attendees vis-
ited vendors like Rainbow SWAG, Gainesville Animal Rescue, Rain-bow Alliance and Stonewall Demo-crats. Various tables sold items from rainbow flags to feather hair acces-sories and homemade salsa.
Event Organizer Terry Fleming said there were 27 new vendors this year.
“It’s all about visibility,” Flem-
ing said. “People coming out need to know people are caring.”
Mayor Craig Lowe stood at a 
booth asking for community sup-port.
“It’s a great event. It gets bigger 
every year,” Lowe said. “It’s a won-derful opportunity for residents and people from around the region come to see the diversity Gainesville has to offer.”
UF LGBT Affairs was part of the 
event as well. LGBT Affairs ambas-sador and sociology sophomore Leah Warwick said the event pro-motes community support.
“It’s really important for the 
community because it lets you see you have support,” the 19-year-old said. “We want to educate the com-munity about us.”
Pride Student Union president 
Bridget Siegel, 20-year-old religion junior, registered voters throughout the festival.
She said she appreciated how 
the community came together for this event.
“It keeps growing,” she said. 
“The community is so fantastic. This is a great way to jump-start the year with Pride Student Union.”
Psychology freshman Frederick 
Franco wore a “Queer at UF” shirt to his first pride event.
“I wanted to meet people and 
see all of the activities,” the 18-year-old said. “I feel like going to Pride is a stepping stone into the commu-nity.”

pharmacy sophomoreDuring the race, runners 
had some trouble with the 
route.
One of the runners in the 
front of the pack took a wrong turn, which turned out to be an unexpected shortcut. Those be-hind followed, causing every runner from third place and below to run 2.6 miles instead of the standard 3.1 miles.
Joe Mueller, a 23-year-old 
exercise and sport science sophomore at Santa Fe Col-lege, won the race. He came to the event straight from his job as assistant cross-country coach at F. W. Buchholz High School.
“The second guy was re-
ally battling it out with me the whole time,” he said. “After -
ward, it was nice to hang out at the House of Beer and meet some new friends.”
He won a trophy and a 32-ounce beer mug shaped like a boot.
After the race, a line of 
runners snaked outside the Gainesville House of Beer to get a 16-ounce glass of Bold City or Yuengling Oktoberfest.
Phillips said a flat donation 
of $250 will go toward A Walk in Your Shoes Inc., and $150 will go to the Pledge 5 Founda-tion. 
He said event organiz-
ers had not counted the total proceeds from the event as of press time.
Entry fees for each runner 
were $30. For those who at-tended to just drink beer, entry fees were $15.
Phillips said to look out for 
another beer run in the spring.
“It’s a new community 
event,” he said. “It also incor -
porates something Gainesville seems to be known for wheth-er they like it or not, and that’s partying.”MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Bravo told police he beat Aguilar until he “lost consciousness”
Bravo told detectives he dropped Agui-
lar off on the side of the road on Northwest 
13th Street and denied fighting him.
Then Bravo’s story changed, saying that 
during the argument, he punched Aguilar in the face and forced him out of the car.
Police continued to question Bravo, who 
then told detectives that outside the car, he beat Aguilar for “10 to 15 minutes” until he “lost consciousness.”
Bravo said he left Aguilar, who was 
“barely breathing and not moving,” lying on the ground.
The last known activity from Aguilar’s 
phone was at 8:14 p.m. on Sept. 20, which Bravo said he turned off and threw into the woods before he returned home.
Following the interview, police drove 
Bravo to where he left Aguilar, but officers were not able to find him.
Officials then issued search warrants for 
Bravo’s apartment in Spyglass Apartments and his Chevrolet Blazer.
Inside Bravo’s car, police found traces of blood.
GPD Spokesman Ben Tobias said blood 
samples were sent to the Florida Depart-ment of Law Enforcement for DNA testing.
Scientists from UF’s Institute of Food 
and Agricultural Science confirmed that limerock dust was also found in Bravo’s car, according to a GPD news release.
On Friday, Tobias asked city property 
owners with limerock roads to check for any disturbances on the ground that could indicate someone buried a body.
In the apartment, officers found Agui-
lar’s backpack hidden inside a suitcase in Bravo’s closet.
They also found a receipt on his dresser, 
which showed that Bravo purchased a roll of duct tape and a shovel on Sept. 16, four days before Aguilar went missing.
Police have not found the shovel or the 
roll of duct tape.
Bravo was arrested Friday and charged 
with premeditated, first-degree murder, which is a capital offense, according to Flor -
ida Statutes.
Bravo was initially charged with depriv-
ing a victim of medical care, a third-degree felony, and held in jail with a $100,000 bond.
Bravo appeared in court Saturday morn-
ing through a live video feed for the second time in front of a judge.
During the hearing, Bravo stood with a 
blank face as Judge David A. Glant denied him bond and officially charged him with murder.
Unlike the other inmates, Bravo wore a 
dark green, one-piece garment, or an anti-suicide smock, which is usually worn by inmates who are at risk of hurting them-selves.
Ronald Kozlowski, one of Bravo’s attor -
neys, would not comment if Bravo was on suicide watch.
A family friend of the Aguilars made a 
statement to the court saying the family ex-tended their condolences to the Bravo fam-ily.
“They understand that there are two 
families suffering today,” she said. “That being said, they do ask that justice please be served.”
Bravo’s family, however, was not at Sat-
urday’s hearing.“They were eager to support their son,” 
Kozlowski said. “However, we were able to persuade them not to come because of all the media attention.”
After the hearing, Kozlowski said Bra-
vo’s parents are “extremely upset and wor -
ried” about their son.
“They feel horrible about this,” he said. 
“They are praying that Chris is found.”
Since Aguilar’s disappearance, more 
than 200 people, which included Aguilar’s friends and family as well as dozens of po-lice agencies, volunteered to help find him.
Supporters helped raise more than $7,500 
on the fundraising website Indiegogo for Aguilar’s family.
Although Aguilar remained missing 
and Bravo faces a murder charge, hope still flows through the volunteers, officers and the Aguilar family.
“A lot of people still have the hope of 
finding him,” said Angelina LaPiana, a 19-year-old political science senior involved with the search. “We’re going to continue searching until we find Christian.”

Sift through a lot of 
lies to ﬁ  nd the truth 
It must be difﬁ  cult to be a vice presidential candidate.
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
Your job is already difﬁ  cult enough, but there is an added 
pressure of being a heartbeat away from taking over the presi-dency of this country.
Joe Biden and Paul Ryan will have their ﬁ  rst debate in less 
than two weeks.
It’s also their only debate.The weird thing about debates during election season is the 
feeling that you have to attack your opponents, to make them look weak, to make them look incompetent.
In the eternal words of Eminem, “You only get one shot; do 
not miss your chance to blow.”
“He’s a witty guy, he knows who he is,” Ryan said, according 
to USA Today. “You’re not going to rattle Joe Biden. Joe is very good on the attack.”
The thing is, does Biden ever really know what he’s doing? 
There’s only so much control he might have over his words at any given time. After all, this is the same guy who said the health care initiative was a “big f***ing deal” on live TV in 2010.
It can be difﬁ  cult to tell, during election seasons, who is tell-
ing the truth. That’s why there are at least two sides to every argument; also, it’s always an argument.
There is no polite way to do politics, unless you’re Leslie 
Knope, and nobody is lucky enough to be Leslie Knope.
“What they don’t tell you, what they really don’t want to talk 
about, is how they’d fundamentally change Medicare,” Biden said, according to an Associated Press report. “They’d turn it into a voucher program.”
“Just down in Florida yesterday , Vice President Biden was 
making up all new falsehoods about Social Security and taxes. They’re trying to scare people for political gain. That’s unfortu-nately the kind of campaign that we’re seeing, as I said with a president without a record to run on,” Ryan said  when he spoke in Columbus, Ohio, according to CNN on Sunday.
So, who are voters supposed to believe on the issues? As possible contributing members to society, it’s your respon-
sibility to do research.
Don’t get sucked into the rhetoric of a political party just be-
cause your friends and family support it; do your own research, and then form your own opinions.
The key word here is “you.” You have to decide, for yourself, 
what you will do.
“We’re running against an incumbent president with in-
credible resources,” Ryan said on Fox News, according to USA Today. “I don’t think one event is going to make or break this campaign.”
Don’t think that this is a grand call to arms, young voters, but 
you should realize that you have a place in this campaign.
Everyone wants to put their best foot forward, but sometimes 
that foot is a liar.
Look at the facts that are presented to you — for the student 
election this week and every other campaign that involves you.
The Swamp Party is the Unite Party
On Tuesday and Wednesday, students will be voting 
for 50 senate seats in the Student Government elec-tions. Students might remember the Students Party 
from the SG elections in the Spring, but they might have also noticed a new party label appearing on stickers and T-shirts across campus: the Swamp Party.
What is this new party, you might ask? Did the corrup-
tion and scandals of the Unite Party ﬁ  nally bring it to the brink of destruction?
No, don’t be fooled. The Swamp Party is the Unite Par-
ty.
But if the Unite Party won the elections in the Spring and 
still controls a majority of the Student Senate, why would it need to change its name?
A trip down memory lane might provide insights into 
this conundrum.  
The Swamp Party is the same party whose supervisor 
of elections failed to take responsibility when voter turnout in District E increased by more than 700 percent due to a system error last Fall.
Not only did the supervisor blame students for this sys-
tem error, but she did virtually nothing to remedy the votes that were obviously cast in the wrong district.
Due to the mishandling of the Fall election, articles of 
impeachment were brought against the supervisor. After the Senate, with a strong Unite Party majority, voted that the supervisor violated eight out of the 13 election codes, it decided that this was not enough cause to impeach the supervisor. Are you kidding?
The Swamp Party is the same party whose presidential 
candidate, Tj Villamil, produced a video falsely accusing the Alligator of racism and fabrication of events when it re-ported that the Unite Party Senate President pro tempore at the time, Jason Tiemeier, threw away copies of the paper before the election.
After Tiemeier resigned from his position (or was forced 
out by party leaders), he eventually confessed and apolo-gized for his wrongdoing.
The Swamp Party is the same party that promoted Katie Waldman to a committee chair position after Tiemeier’s confes-sion letter to the Alligator placed Waldman with Tiemeier at the scene when he threw away the newspapers.
Whether Waldman disposed 
of the newspapers or not is ir-relevant. The fact is she knew Tiemeier was responsible and 
failed to come forward, even when her party’s leaders were accusing the Alligator of fabricating the story.  
The Swamp Party is the same party that, at the begin-
ning of the Summer semester, revised the SG election codes to limit student free speech during elections. The new codes limit explicit campaigning to one week prior to the election and extend the ability of Elections Commission to give vio-lations to online communications that do not have “Regis-tered Political Advertisement.”
This arbitrary requirement could penalize parties and 
candidates for online posts made on their behalf by indi-viduals who are not members of the party and who are not running for ofﬁ  ce.
Of course, these recent events only scratch the surface 
of the Swamp/Unite Party’s corruption. In one story last year, a sorority member “described a social environment that catered to the Unite Party by coercing members to vote and pass out ﬂ  iers for Unite to get privileges and that gener-ally perpetuated a silent mandate to support the party or be subtly ostracized, even reprimanded.”
Don’t let the name change and the ﬂ  ashy new shirts fool 
you; the Swamp Party is the same party of corruption, fa-voritism, backroom deals, dirty politics and intimidation that has been at UF for a long time. Whether they call them-selves Orange and Blue, Unite or Swamp, just remember that they will continue to behave this way until they are held to some level of accountability.

ate student at UF.

jhayes@alligator.org MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 7
When making the choice to slate 
with a party, it wasn’t much of a choice.
I wanted a party that shared my passion 
for placing the students at the forefront of all policies.
I wanted a party that had not been miti-
gated by years of inefficiencies and inef-fectiveness.
I wanted a party that stood together for 
tomorrow and remained together when serving the students at UF.
When making the choice to slate with 
a party, Swamp Party not only had the fresh face I was looking for, but, by far and away, was the party that demonstrated its commitment to improvement, commit-ment to excellence and most importantly, commitment to the students.
If elected, this will be my second year in Senate, having served last Fall, Spring and Summer C.
In the past year, I have had the distinct 
privilege of representing the students and bringing them the results they deserve, in-cluding 24-hour/five-days-a-week Library West, the phone charging stations around campus and much more.
As a member of the Budget and Ap-
propriations Committee headed by chair -
woman Christina Bonarrigo, I increased funding to hundreds of student and aca-demic organizations to promote student involvement and input at the university.
As a member of the Rules and Ethics 
Committee, I have continually upheld the guidelines by which the Student Senate operates and provided fair, unbiased rul-ings on dozens, if not hundreds, of sena-tors.Currently, I am 
working on a va-riety of projects, including the con-solidation of UF’s IT services, includ-
ing ISIS, Sakai and Webmail, and along with chairwoman Lauren Verno of the Rules and Ethics Committee, developing a workshop for the Student Body as a means to increase transparency and implore the students to become more involved with Senate.
I mention my experience because it is 
but a semblance when compared to the collective experience of Swamp Party’s candidates.
The experience, qualifications and en-
thusiasm that Swamp Party offers is sec-ond to none. Our candidates have collectively served 
on virtually every type of student organi-zation, create the most diverse slate of-fered this semester and are more prepared and excited to serve the students than any other slate I have ever seen.
I didn’t choose Swamp Party because it 
had “been there, done that” like the other parties.
I chose Swamp Party because it is com-
mitted to the Gator Nation and will do what is right by you and the rest of the Student Body at UF if elected Tuesday and Wednesday.

Forward McKenzie Barney (4) pushes the ball past Arkansas forward Lindsey Mayo (25) in UF’s 
4-0 win on Sunday at James G. Pressly Stadium. Barney netted a goal in her return from injury. 
 �BARNEY SCORED THE THIRD 
GOAL IN THE GATORS’ 4-0 WIN.
  ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
 Alligator Writer
   
 McKenzie Barney was frustrated 
with being on the bench due to in-
jury, and she took advantage of being healthy on Sunday. 
  When Barney returned to the ﬁ  eld 
in the 22nd minute against Arkansas, she didn’t waste much time getting back into the swing of things.
  After the redshirt senior suffered a 
right knee injury at the end of Flori-da’s match with Georgia on Sept. 23, she spent all of Friday’s game watch-ing her teammates defeat Mississippi 3-1.
  “Unfortunately, I’ve had to do that 
a lot in my career,” Barney said.
  Fifteen minutes after entering 
Sunday’s game, Barney received a through ball from sophomore Annie Bobbitt and went against goalie Sam Wolf 1-on-1. Barney struck the ball 4 yards out and netted her 30th career goal, putting UF up 3-0.
  Barney became only the seventh 
player to score 30 goals in her career at UF.
  “That’s a huge honor,” Barney said.
  Barney was one of seven Gators 
who scored during the weekend, which was capped by No. 24 Florida’s (8-3-1, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) 4-0 victory against Arkansas (5-6-1, 2-3-1 SEC) on Sunday at James G. Pressly Stadium.
  “That’s what makes us very dif-
ﬁ  cult to defend,” Gators coach Becky Burleigh said. “It’s sort of a pick-your-poison situation.”
  Florida had a mix of underclassmen 
and upperclassmen score on Sunday. In addition to Barney’s goal, senior Holly King drilled in a header in the 29th minute to put UF up 2-0.
  “I just started back post and just 
followed my marker in and then cut in front of her to get it,” King said. 
  Sophomore Annie Speese started 
the scoring with a 15-yard shot off of a free kick. The goal was Speese’s sec-ond of the year. 
  “[Defender Maggie Rodgers] 
played me the ball,” Speese said. “I just took a touch wide, played it back post because I saw that the keeper was moving to the near post.”
  The Gators took advantage of the 
Razorbacks keeper’s inexperience. Wolf, Sunday’s starter, had only played 90 minutes at goalkeeper this Florida forward’s return to lineup keys victory against Arkansas

 Following Florida’s season opener, 
coach Mary Wise talked about the inten-
sity of the crowd. 
After escaping Arkansas with a ﬁ  ve-set 
victory, she talked about how proud she was of her team’s effort.
But after Sunday’s sweep against Mis-
sissippi State, she had the luxury of simply talking numbers.
  Wise focused on the stat sheet after the 
Gators’ three-set victory (25-14, 25-9, 25-18) against the Bulldogs (4-10, 0-5 South-eastern Conference), who remained in the cellar of the SEC.
  While talking about how Florida’s 
serving and blocking vaulted her team to an 11-2 overall record and 5-0 SEC mark, Wise turned her focus to the ofﬁ  cial score-keeper’s stinginess in awarding blocks.
  “I think the ofﬁ  cial scorekeeper prob-
ably lost track of a few more blocks than even we had,” she said. “[He] had us for 11. We had us for more 
than that.”
  Still, Florida statistically dominated 
Mississippi State near and away from the net.
  “We served extremely well,” Wise said. 
“So much of this match was decided on the ﬁ  rst contact behind the service line. To beat teams, you have to serve and block well because that sets up everything else. We served well, we blocked well and we had 
fantastic defensive back-row play, and that’s what we were really trying to emphasize with 
the team.”
  Coming into the weekend, the Gators 
averaged 8.42 service errors and just more than ﬁ  ve aces per match. 
Against the Bulldogs, Florida chalked 
up its average ﬁ  ve aces but reduced its er-rors to only two.

  Florida’s matchup against LSU on 
Saturday naturally evokes memories of last season’s 41-11 beatdown, but this isn’t the same Tigers team. 
  The 2011 group was utterly domi-
nant until the national title game. Sure, they couldn’t pass, but the defense was unﬂ  appable and the running game was unstoppable. 
  The 2012 version of LSU has many 
ﬂ  aws, meaning Florida has a better chance to pull an upset on Saturday than the Tigers’ No. 4 ranking might suggest. 
  In a 12-10 win against Auburn on 
Sept. 22 and a 38-22 win against Tow-son on Saturday, LSU’s shortcomings were on display. 
  Leading up to Saturday, coach Les 
Miles talked about wanting to make improvements and iron out the wrin-kles following the disappointment against Auburn. 
After another poor showing, Miles 
described the mood in the locker room as somber. 
  “To say that we made improve-ment, I can’t say that,” Miles said. 
“I’d have to 
say it was the same style of football that we played last week.”
  Perhaps the Tigers’ most glar-
ing weakness is the lack of a passing game. 
  Whether it’s the transition to Zach 
Mettenberger at quarterback or the loss of Rueben Randle at wideout, the Tigers haven’t been able to move the ball through the air. 
LSU has the nation’s 95th-ranked 
passing attack, with just 203.2 yards per game. 
  Despite a concerted effort to get the 
passing game going — Mettenberger threw 26 times, including four in a row with LSU already up 31-16 midway through the fourth quarter — LSU tal-lied only 238 yards through the air. LSU’s ﬂ  aws give UF hope

UF freshman Jessica Thielmann speaks to her teammates 
at the All Florida Invitational on Sunday.

Junior Alicia Mathieu’s job on Sunday was much 
different than a majority of the field. While most 
Gators only had to worry about swimming 100 or 200 yards for an event, Mathieu had to swim a mile.
In the 66-lap, 1,650-yard freestyle, Mathieu came 
from behind against teammate and training partner Jessica Thielmann to win and set the pace for Florida on the final day of the All Florida Invitational.
“It definitely feels much better coming back than 
getting caught,” Mathieu said. “It gives you a lot of extra motivation as you’re catching someone and going by them, so it felt pretty good.” 
Mathieu won with a time of 16:37.03 to help ex-
tend the women’s lead by 20. 
While Mathieu controlled the pool with endur -
ance, Brad deBorde dominated the sprint events. Af-ter deBorde finished second in the 50 free to Florida State’s Mark Weber on Friday , the junior took first place in the 100 free with a time of 44.88 on Sunday.
“He was a little 
disappointed with the 50 on his first day , but that’s only because 
Brad expects to win every time he goes to the block,” associate head coach Martyn Wilby said. “I couldn’t be happier with him. It’s a great starting point for him.” 
After winning the 100 free by .16 seconds, deBorde 
wrapped up the meet by swimming the second leg in the 400 free relay. In that race, deBorde helped UF beat out FSU’s relay team by .13 seconds.
“I’m a sprinter, so it’s what I’m used to,” deBorde 
said. “I live on that .01 difference, so I know that ev-ery little thing I do makes a difference. I like to put the pressure on in practice and get the little things right, so in the meet, it’s just rehearsal.” 
The men ended with a clean sweep on Sunday 
by winning all six events. They also won the meet with a total of 1,273 points — 354 ahead of second-place FSU. The women also secured a team win with 1,141.5 points and 12 top-three finishes. 
“This morning might have been our worst ses-
sion in terms of racing and in terms of swimming where you need to be, but we turned it around tonight,” Wilby said. “I thought tonight was re-ally good. There was a lot of good racing, and that’s what you’re looking for.”

Florida junior Olivia Janowicz is off to the best start of her 
career, and she doesn’t look to be slowing down. In her first 
six matches, she is undefeated.
In 2010, Janowicz won two matches before her first loss. In 
2011, she won one match before her first defeat.
Janowicz won both of her matches on Saturday to begin the 
pre-qualifying round of the Riviera/ITA All-American Cham-pionships. On Sunday, Janowicz beat Iowa’s Ruth Seaborne  6-1, 3-6, 6-1, to guarantee a spot in the qualifying round.
Freshman Danielle Collins also advanced, winning her 
three matches in swift fashion.
“This was as good as we have ever looked in the pre-qual-
ifying draw of this event,” UF coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
“Danielle and Olivia both looked powerful, fit and mentally strong during their match-es. Not only today , but throughout their 
three matches to advance.”
After this weekend’s action, Janowicz is 
a perfect 6-0. Janowicz was 7-5 in tourna-ment play last season.
In her six singles matches, Janowicz has 
outscored her opponents 81-43 in games. Only two of those matches have gone to a 
third set. 
She and Collins are also undefeated in doubles this season, 
going 3-0 so far. Janowicz will continue to look ahead to the next match in the Riviera/ITA All-American Championships as she looks for redemption after losing in two sets in the round of 32 during last year’s qualifying. 
“I’m proud of how they have performed and look forward 
to seeing them after a day of rest and back on the court for their next matches,” Thornqvist said.
Janowicz and Collins will join teammates Alexandra Cer -
cone, Caroline Hitimana and Sofie Oyen as they compete in the qualifying round on Tuesday and Wednesday in Pacific Palisades, Calif. 
Each player will have to win three consecutive matches to 
move on to the main draw.
“The competition gets more challenging every round of 
the Riviera, and I’m excited to see how we respond at that next level,” Thornqvist said.Junior tennis player

Florida midfielder Annie Speese dribbles past Arkansas midfielder 
Jessie Givens in Sunday’s 4-0 win at James G. Pressly Stadium.
vice aces improved to 10-1 on 
the season.
In addition to Florida’s dom-
inance behind the service line, the squad’s front line stepped up defensively with 11 blocks — the most in a three-set match this season. 
Florida’s 20 block assists 
were also Florida’s most in a three-set match. 
The squad’s next closest 
blocking performance was Sept. 21 against Missouri, when Flor -
ida had 14 block assists.
Florida outhit Arkansas .342 
to .064. 
But, for the first time all year, 
no Gator registered double-dig-it kills. 
Every active player for Flor -
ida entered the match for the first time since UF played Flori-da A&M on Aug. 25.
All but four players had at 
least one kill on the day. Senior Tangerine Wiggs led 
the team with nine, while senior Betsy Smith and freshman Ziva Recek finished right behind her with eight each.
Chloe Mann and Simone 
Antwi each added six kills.
The Gators’ strategy of let-
ting everyone have their touch-es paid off, as the Bulldogs did not lead a set until the third, when Wise and her team were down 2-1. 
Florida quickly took back 
the lead with four consecutive points and never let up again, winning the final set and the match.
Florida is the only SEC school 
with an undefeated conference record as it heads home to face Arkansas and Kentucky for the second time this season.
“These two teams are red hot 
right now,” Wise said. “I think it will be one of the toughest home stands that we’ve had in SEC history.”
Sophomore scores 
first goal with UF 
season prior to Sunday’s game. In her first season at 
Arkansas, she played defense.
Florida scored the game’s fourth goal on a penalty 
kick by sophomore Tatiana Perez in the final minute. The goal was Perez’s first in her time at UF.
“I’ve been working hard in practice to get a chance 
to get on the field,” Perez said. “I had the chance to add one up for our team, and it just feels great that I was able to contribute.”
For the fifth time in six games, the Gators scored 
first. Florida is 4-1 during that span.
“When we do that, it really takes the pressure off 
and allows us to play a little bit freer,” Burleigh said. 
The win against Arkansas was UF’s fifth consecu-
tive victory. Florida has not lost since falling 2-1 to Kentucky on Sept. 14.
Despite matching the team’s season-high goal total, 
Burleigh expects more.
“I was happy with the first half,” she said. “I think 
in the second half, I was a little disappointed we didn’t score more.”SOCCER , from page 13

CROSS COUNTRY
Mettenberger missed multiple open 
throws, and his receivers compounded the 
issue with drops. 
The rain in Death Valley made for an 
easy excuse, but that isn’t nearly enough to justify LSU’s five fumbles. 
And it has nothing to do with the Tigers 
committing 10 penalties for 69 yards, a re-curring trend for a group that ranks No. 110 nationally with 8.4 penalties per game. 
“It was just sloppy play,” Mettenberger 
said. 
“We have been sloppy week in and week 
out. We have to clean it up. Right now we are not playing LSU football. I’m very dis-appointed in myself and the team right now.”
The sloppy play wasn’t limited to the of-
fense. 
An experienced and supremely talented 
defense missed tackle after tackle. 
Yes, the outfit is still in the top 10 against 
both the run and the pass. 
Multiple players will make a lot of mon-
ey in the NFL. 
But, right now, they’re a little vulner -
able. 
Especially against an offense like Flori-
da’s, which will aim to establish itself physi-cally and grind it out on the ground. 
LSU defensive ends Barkevious Mingo 
and Sam Montgomery have a chance to be top-10 NFL Draft picks. But Mingo is 240 pounds, and Montgomery is 260. They’re speed rushers, not run-stuffers. 
The Tigers don’t have a defensive line-
man who weighs more than 308 pounds. 
Against a Florida offensive line that con-
tinually boasts improved size, strength and toughness because of its work in the weight room during the offseason, this could be a favorable matchup. 
Of course, there’s always the possibility 
LSU snaps out of it. 
Maybe Towson was LSU’s version of 
Bowling Green. 
The Tigers played sub-optimally by 
choice to try to iron out some wrinkles, and they’ll kick it into high gear against a legiti-mate opponent. 
But if they don’t, a surprisingly strong 
Florida team will have a good shot at its most shocking win yet; one that would pro-pel UF into the type of title discussion few expected we’d hear this season.

Sophomore Phil Duncan and junior Shel-
by Hayes each notched their best collegiate 
times and first event victories en route to Gators’ team victories on Saturday morning at the Saint Leo Cross Country Fall Invita-tional.
Florida finished with five runners in the 
top six in women’s competition, amounting to a 17-point victory.
“On the women’s side, Shelby Hayes did 
a great job,” Gators coach Paul Spangler said. “We used a different strategy today, went out a more even pace, and her 5K mark was actually faster than her time at [the Mountain Dew Invitational].”
Spangler added that Hayes’ performance 
was especially impressive due to the diffi-culty of the course at Saint Leo. 
Hayes earned the first event victory of 
her college career with a personal-best 6K time of 21:26.20. She set her  previous mark (23:21:94) at the 2011 Southeastern Confer-ence Championships in Knoxville, Tenn.
Senior Mandy Perkins finished second 
behind Hayes, while freshman Shelby Da-vidson finished third. Juniors Brittany Ko-ziara and Sarah Davis took fifth and sixth place.
Saturday’s event was the first 6K race for 
Davidson and Koziara at Florida.
On the men’s side, Duncan was one of four Gators in the top 10. All five scorers fin-ished in the top 15.
Duncan topped his impressive perfor-
mance in the Mountain Dew Invitational on Sept. 15, when he posted a then-collegiate 
best 26:01.86 in the 8K. Duncan finished first with a 26:00.40.
“A big congrats to Phil 
Duncan on his first big college victory — a per-
sonal best on a difficult 8K course today,” Spangler said. “Phil did a great job 
midway through the race of catching the lead pack and passing them over the last half of the race. Our fifth scorer, John Mitch-ell, also did a great job — he passed about 10 guys in the last half of the race to secure the team victory for us.”
Redshirt freshman Harsha Torke finished 
fourth. Freshman Elliot Clemente was Flor-ida’s third scorer, earning a sixth-place fin-ish. Similar to Duncan, Clemente improved upon his career-best 8K mark, lowering it from 27:04.93 at the Mountain Dew Invita-tional to 26:57.80 at Saint Leo.
Gators distance track runners Dan We-
hunt and John Mitchell, running their first 8K races since 2009, finished ninth and 14th overall to score fourth and fifth for UF.
Mitchell eclipsed his previous career-best 
time of 28:10.65 at the FSU Invitational in the fall of 2009 with Saturday’s 28:02.60.

 Senior Tyler McCumber has 
had success at the Olympia 
Fields/Illini Invitational before, and on Sunday he got out to an-other strong start. 
  McCumber was a bright spot 
amid Florida’s early round strug-gles, collecting two birdies to carry a -2 through the 11th hole. But McCumber birdied once and bogeyed three times over the ﬁ  -nal seven holes, rounding out the ﬁ  rst day with a 70 (E).
  Last season, McCumber led 
the team during the Olympia Fields/Illini Invitational and ﬁ  n-ished in a tie for seventh place, marking his second consecutive top-10 ﬁ  nish at the event. 
  He is currently tied for second 
on the individual leaderboard, two strokes behind Nicholas Lo-sole (-2) of Northwestern. 
  Florida’s men’s golf team ﬁ  n-
ished the ﬁ  rst day of play on Sun-day in Olympia Fields, Ill., with a team score of +15 (295), putting it in a tie for seventh place and 12 strokes behind tournament lead-er Arkansas.
  The Olympia Fields/Illini In-
vite boasts a wealth of top-tier programs, presenting a greater challenge for UF than the sea-son’s ﬁ  rst tournament — The In-vitational at the Ocean Course on Sept. 11.   The ﬁ  eld includes eight teams 
that are ranked or received votes in the most recent coaches’ poll, including No. 8 Arkansas and No. 16 Florida State.
  UF turned 
in an opening round 295 team score (+15). 
M c C u m b e r 
carded an even par and sopho-more J.D. Tom-linson ﬁ  nished 
the ﬁ  rst round with a 72 (+2), a ﬁ  ve-stroke improvement from last year’s ﬁ  rst round of the Olympia Fields Invite (77).
  “This is a really good golf 
course,” Gators coach Buddy Al-exander said. 
“It was pretty difﬁ  cult, espe-
cially for our younger players with its quick greens.”
  The Gators are competing in 
the Olympia Fields/Illini Invite for the fourth straight year. Last year, Florida ﬁ  nished in seventh place in its ﬁ  rst tournament of the season.
  Tomlinson is tied with 11 play-
ers for ninth place. 
  “Tyler and J.D. put together 
two decent scores,” Alexander said. 
  Despite the strong showings 
from McCumber and Tomlinson, Florida could not build upon their success.
  Senior T.J Vogel struggled, bogeying early and often. He bo-geyed nine times throughout the day, but tallied three birdies to bring his ﬁ  rst round total to 76 (+6).
  Redshirt sophomore Santiago 
Gavino birdied three holes, ﬁ  n-ishing his ﬁ  rst round since join-ing Florida in 2010 with a score of 77 (+7). 
  Like Gavino, freshman A.J. 
Crouch recorded his ﬁ  rst round of play on Saturday, carding an 80 (+10) to round out the Gators’ day. He bogeyed six holes and notched two double-bogeys. 
  The Gators will be the ﬁ  rst 
team to pick up play Monday morning at 9 at the Olympia Fields Country Club.
