Toy gun ban may
kill zombie game
0 UF'S DEPARTMENT OF
HOUSING BANNED TOY GUNS
IN RESIDENCE HALLS.
By GLENN COINE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Zombie fever is taking over UT,
but the Department of Housing and
Residence Education is trying to
keep the infection from spreading to
residence halls.
The second game of Gators Hu-
mans vs. Zombies started at mid-
night today and ends next Monday.
On Friday, students who live in
campus housing received an e-mail
citing Housing and Residence Edu-
cation Community Standards and
reminding them that they are for-
bidden from playing with or storing
toy weapons in residence halls.
"Residents that are involved in
the Humans v. Zombies event are
directed to store their equipment
(including but not limited to Nerf-
style toy guns and other items that
launch projectiles) in their vehicles,"
JoCynda Hudson, coordinator of
residential judicial programs, wrote
in the e-mail.Jesse Schmitt, founder and presi-
dent of Gators Humans vs. Zombies,
said he is not too concerned about
the e-mail.
"People on our side or on their
side should not be getting that
worked up over a toy," he said.
He met with housing officials to
discuss the rule because they had
expressed concern during the last
game of Humans vs. Zombies on
Feb. 25 through Feb. 28.
"People on our side or on
their side should not be
getting that worked up over
a toy."
Jesse Schmitt
founder and president of Gators
Humans vs. Zombies
The officials suggested storing
the weapons in cars.
Schmitt said the rules of the game
forbid students from playing inside
any campus buildings, and he has
received approval from the UF ad-
ministration and the University Po-
lice Department to host the game.
"If it does become an issue, I'll
deal with it then," he said.
CAMPUS
Officer on paid vacation
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
Keith Smith, the University Police
Department officer who shot graduate
student Kofi Adu-Brempong last month,
has elected to remain on vacation instead
of returning to administrative duty.
According to UF spokeswoman Jan-
ine Sikes, Smith is receiving vacation pay
while away.
Sikes was not able to confirm when
Smith's vacation started.
The other four officers involved in
the case remain on administrative duty,
which is standard procedure during an
internal investigation.
But many students believe Smithshould be further punished for his part
in the incident. Smith's termination was
one of the demands made by student
protesters to the UF Board of Trustees
last month.
Smith's recent controversy is com-
pounded by his involve-
ment in the downtown
egg-throwing incident
last November, when
he and three Gainesville
Police Department of-
ficers were accused of
Sike harassing known pros-
titutes.
Smith was given a verbal reprimand
for his involvement, according to the Al-
ligator archives.Early city voting begins
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
Gainesville residents can now vote
in the runoff election for their next
mayor and District 4 city commis-
sioner.
Early voting begins today from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. at the County Adminis-
tration Building, located at 12 SE First
St., and runs through Saturday.
Up for mayor are Craig Lowe and
Don Marsh, and Randy Wells and
Penny Wheat vie for the Disctrict 4
seat." [Early voting] really allows peo-ple who have busy schedules to vote
at their convenience," said Alachua
County Supervisor of Elections Pam
Carpenter.
She hopes participation increases
during the runoff, but
Local historically, a second
News election draws fewer
voters than the first.
UF students looking to vote early
can hitch a ride with members of
Lowe's campaign, who will be driv-
ing students from the Plaza of the
Americas to the County Administra-
tion Building this week from 10 a.m.
to 3 p.m.
The runoff election is April 13.

0 THE FACEBOOK APP MATCHES
STUDENTS TO TUTORS.
By ASHLEY MOSES
Alligator Contributing Writer
As final exams approach, Facebook
could prove to be more than just a dis-
traction from studying.
Through Tutor Matching Service, a
Facebook application, UF students can
search for tutors using their names, sub-
jects or course codes.
They can book and pay for tutoring
appointments online, said Jessica Bent,
the vice president of Tutor Matching Ser-
vice public relations.
UF is the first university to use the
service, but the University of Central
Florida is beginning to use the service as
well, Bent said.
"The connection between the students
and tutor is stronger because students are
able to see the profile of their tutor ahead
of time," Bent said.The system was created by Student
Government in the summer of 2009, but
Bent said she believes Tutor Matching
Service will see an increase in system use
during exam time.
Rajiv Asnani, the student manager
of Tutor Matching Service, said tutoring
is available in a variety of subjects from
lower-level math to biochemistry.
It's free for students to search for tu-
tors on Facebook and free for tutors
to post information
U F about their services,AcadeMICS Asnani said.
Students can pay
by credit card through a secure system,
he said.
Bent said they can either purchase
individual sessions or a package of ses-
sions in advance and can choose between
one-on-one tutoring and group tutoring
of up to three students. The tutor sharing
feature allows students to split the hourly
rate, which starts at $10 an hour and is set
by the tutors.

UF professors link FCAT
scores, wealth distribution
By MEGAN MCGARRELL
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF researchers have proven there is a link
between students' home life and their perfor-
mances on the FCAT.
Harry Daniels, professor of counselor
education, and Grant Thrall, professor of
business geography, announced their find-
ings March 20 in Pittsburgh at the American
Counseling Association's annual conference
and exposition.
The model predicts how well students
will perform on standardized tests based on
their addresses.
"Being a resident of Florida, I am pain-
fully aware of the blame teachers get for stu-
dents' performance in school," Daniels said.
"People always put the fault with the teach-
ers, but I doubted that logic."
Daniels collected data from Alachua
County and Bay County public schools and
used Thrall's market research techniques to
prove the connection.
Using Thrall's lifestyle segmentation pro-
files, which are a record of spending hab-its from a certain group of homes, Daniels
divided students into four categories with
Group 1 being the most wealthy and Group
4 being the lowest income category.
"We need to modify curriculum so
it appeals and has meaning to all
students in school."
Harry Daniels
professor of counselor education
Daniels found that students in Group 3
scored a grade level below those in Group 1.
Daniels attributes the disparity to curricu-
lum, instruction and family background.
"We need to modify curriculum so it
appeals and has meaning to all students in
school," he said.
William Goodman, supervisor of guid-
ance and student services for Alachua Coun-
ty Public Schools, said he wants to use the re-
search to find out what places need the most
assistance, adding it will help him find the
areas that would benefit from after-school
programs and weekend tutoring.

'Redneck' comedian draws
about 3,500 to O'Dome
* RON WHITE SMOKED AND DRANK
ONSTAGE AND TOLD ANECDOTES ABOUT
TRAVELING, SNUGGlES.
By ERIN O'DEA
Alligator Contributing Writer
The lights dimmed, and a bottle of Scotch
glowed on the stage of the O'Connell Center Fri-
day night.
It signaled the start of Grammy-nominated
Ron White's stand-up comedy act, complete with
spirit-drinking, cigar-smoking and laughter from
the crowd of about 3,500 people.
White's show was part of his Behavioral Prob-
lems tour, which started as a Comedy Central
stand-up special that drew in 3.3 million TV
viewers in 2009, according to White's Web site.
With puffs of smoke trailing behind him,
White began the show with anecdotes about tour-
ing and vice in Las Vegas.
He said he broke his tooth in an "alcohol-re-
lated pool incident" and found that it would costmore than $47,000 for a dentist to repair the dam-
age.
White moved on to talk about his humble be-
ginnings as a comedian, his wife and his New
Year's resolution to get in shape.
"If I ever see a dog wearing a Snuggie,
I'm going to kill it because that's what I
think it would want me to do."
Ron White
comedian
Of the barrage of anecdotes White told about
his wife, one was about a time when she was star-
ing at a Snuggie infomercial.
He joined her and learned about Snuggies for
dogs.
"If I ever see a dog wearing a Snuggie, I'm go-
ing to kill it because that's what I think it would
want me to do," White said.
Tickets were $25 for students, and nonstudents
paid about $40.
White's production company rented out the
O'Connell Center for the event.Comedian Ron White smokes a cigar and drinks Scotch whiskey while
doing his stand-up comedy act at the O'Connell Center on Friday night.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH
Student groups collect dental supplies
By ASHLEY HEMMY
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF's cheerleading squad and
pre-dental association teamed up
to help keep Gainesville smiling.
Nine members of the pre-dental
chapter of UF's American Student
Dental Association collected more
than 5,000 items from local high
schools and dentists from March
1 to March 31 for their Cheers for
Smiles fundraiser.
Buchholz High School, St. Fran-
cis Catholic High School and P.K.
Yonge Developmental ResearchSchool collected toothbrushes,
toothpaste, dental floss and mouth-
wash in a competition to win a pep
rally performedby the Gator Cheer-
leaders, who perform alongside the
football, basketball, gymnastics and
volleyball teams
"Oral hygiene is often over-
looked as a necessity," said Patrick
Fitzgerald, a UF sophomore and
UF cheerleader who came up with
the idea for the fundraiser. "This
fundraiser is meant to promote oral
health and education."
The club is still counting the
number of items donated by each
school and will determine which"This fundraiser is meant
to promote oral health and
education."
Patrick Fitzgerald
UF sophomore and cheerleader
high school donated the most this
week.
The items collected will be do-
nated to the St. Francis House and
also given to local church groups
going on mission trips to Haiti be-
cause St. Francis House's quota for
dental donations has been filled for
this year, Fitzgerald said.St. Francis House usually hands
out about 2,000 toothbrushes each
year, he said.
Microbiology junior Morgan
Coakley, who is a member of the
club, said some people are unable
to afford dental care.
Fitzgerald, who has volunteered
at the St. Francis House, said he's
met people who haven't had access
to a toothbrush for several days.
Poor oral hygiene can lead to
bigger issues like heart problems
and other diseases, he said.
Fitzgerald said he hopes Cheers
for Smiles will become an annual
community service project.

0 ANGULO, COOPER AND
SELWACH REFLECT ON
ELECTION.
By ALEX ORLANDO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Their yard signs may be down,
their support stickers thrown away,
but the three Gainesville mayoral
candidates who didn't make the
runoff election aren't calling it quits.
After losing the election to candi-
dates Craig Lowe and Don Marsh,
Ozzy Angulo, Monica Leadon Coo-
per and Richard Selwach are still
looking out for the best interests of
their community.
Angulo, who secured 1.51 per-
cent of the votes, is working as a
server for the Waffle House on
Newberry Road.
Since finishing last place in the
mayoral election, Angulo has been
gearing up for a run at the District 3
city commissioner seat when it's up
for election.
"The election has definitely
opened a lot of doors for me," An-
gulo said.
He said he is endorsing Lowe
in the runoff election because he
supports rights for gays and immi-
grants.
Rather than buying signs or
bumper stickers to promote his bid
for mayor, AnguloLocal used business cards,
News spending $58.49 of his
total $415.80.
"I made this as an outlet to dem-
onstrate the kind of person I am," he
said.
Cooper, who received 24.89 per-
cent of the votes, said she would not
have changed anything about her
campaign.
Remnants of the election remain
in her own backyard -she's using
the campaign stakes signs to hold
up tomato plants in her garden.
She said that aside from running
her local nutrition business, Shaklee
Health and Nutrition, she is remain-
ing active in local government. She
spoke out at a City Commission
meeting Thursday night, criticizing
the proposed biomass plant.
Her largest campaign expen-
diture, $4,006.94, went to the U.S.
Postal Service to send out fliers.
Selwach, who finished the race in
fourth place, is still at his business,
Best Jewelry & Loan Pawnbrokers.
Securing 4.35 percent of the vote,
he said he may run again next year,
but for now, he's endorsing Marsh
in the runoff.
Selwach blames his loss on a
tight campaign budget of $10,300, all
of which he raised himself. He said
most of his would-be supporters did
not take him seriously because of his
refusal to accept donations, which
he referred to as "payment for other
favors."

Dr. No
Anti-Obama doctor is
practicing discrimination
W knew people would be fighting against the health
care changes, but somehow people always manage to
surprise us with exactly how far they will go, planting
their feet and digging their nails into the wall if they have to, in
order to resist change.
Dr. Jack Cassell, a urologist from Mount Dora, posted a sign
on his office door asking patients who voted for Obama to "seek
urologic care elsewhere." The sign went on to read, "Changes to
your health care begin now, not in four years."
Cassell said in an interview that most of his patients have
been "overwhelmingly supportive" of him and that they stand
by his controversial stance. This makes us wonder why Cassell
put the sign up at all since he already has a like-minded follow-
ing of patients who don't seem to have a problem with his new
stipulation and didn't vote for Obama.
One has to wonder what makes this kind of treatment okay.
Cassell argues, "I'm not turning anyone away, that would be
unethical." He said if people see the sign and leave, "so be it."
Good to know. Maybe Cassell isn't technically breaking any
laws, but the whole thing seems morally unethical to us. Doc-
tors are supposed to be healers and helpers, not people who
judge individuals by their chosen political candidate or any af-
filiation.
Here's our advice to Cassell: If you don't want to put your
ego aside and help people when it really counts, don't be a doc-
tor.
Zombie Nation
Just when you thought itwas safe to cross the Tur-
lington minefield, another
socially aimless specimen is
trying to rise from the grave-
yard of "who gives a crap?"
By now you've probably
mastered all the techniques
to side-stepping those tribal
dancers, waltzing around
the circus of fire-breathing
preachers and sliding past
those suicide-awareness ac-
tivists whose ability to an-
noyingly melt a microphone
doesn't help in their cause.
However, these techniques
have proven powerless to the
latest clog in the Gainesville
gene pool: the zombie.
A not-so-distant cousin to
the people who live in their
parents basement until their
40s, dress up for comic book
conventions and live on a diet
of snack packs and Sega Gen-
esis, the zombie is the result
of allowing socially stunted
children to escape from Nev-
erland Ranch before they
were allowed to climb Mr.
Jefferson's wishing tree. (Hee-
hee-hee-shamonah!)
Attempts to communicate
with this mysterious herd ofhumanity, whose only expe-
rience with intimate contact is
through its plastic lightsaber
duels to see who gets the first
dice roll in Dungeons and
Dragons, has proven impos-
sible as they only speak a dia-
lect that mixes Klingon, Japa-
nese anime and retainers.
While they may have an
unhealthy fetish for the half-
dead, their excessive over-
hype is what's really decay-
ing. We get that it's fun to
pretend, but when you have
to bombard us with Facebook
invites and hang up a pleth-
ora of posters all across cam-
pus, it may be time to go on to
Peter Pan.
So when one of them
tries to lob a paper grenade
at you or blast you halfway
to hell with his Nerf gun on
your way to class, explain to
him or her that Santa Claus is
dead, the Easter Bunny isn't
real, Captain Planet votes Re-
publican and that it would be
in everyone's best interest if
they played with live ammu-
nition in a closed-off, isolated
space far from sight.
The people with the mega-
phones can keep score.

Letters to the Editor
Reader offers simple solution for ladies
night
I'm pretty sure there's a simple solution
to the controversy in this town over "ladies
night" at the bars. Placate all sides by doing
away with free drinks for women and re-
place the specials with free drinks for any-
one who shows up in a dress and heels.
Adam Vaughn
UF student
No one is offended by ladies nights
There appears to be no limit to what
busybody bureaucrats like Gainesville's
Equal Opportunity Director Cecil Howard
will
do next. The push to end "ladies night"
may seem like a minor annoyance, but this
egregious abuse of government power
should be opposed by all groups, male and
female.
Are "ladies nights" discrimination?
Yeah. So, what? Anti-discrimination laws
were put in place to penalize businesses
that discriminated in a way that offends a
normal person's sense of justice and mo-
rality (whether it's moral to impose your
views on someone else is a discussion for
another day).
If a law firm offered a black law studenta job after reading his r6sum6, looking at
his grades, giving him a phone interview
and then fired him as soon as they saw the
color of his skin, almost all of us would
find that action morally offensive. Ladies
night, however, offends (practically) no
one's sense of justice or fairness. Newsflash
to Mr. Howard: Guys and gals love ladies
nights.
So mind your own damn business and
let the ladies at UF enjoy their free drinks
on Wednesday night at Gat
Copper Monkey.

wers to love U U UUF should be concerned with state's
education issues, not its rank
Yesterday, I was invited to a group on
Facebook called "Make UF Florida's Flag-
ship School." I appreciate the support for
UF, but as a Floridian this horrifies me. We
are all Gators at UF, and we all want to be
seen as the best in Florida. While I refuse
to take a stance on whether we are better
than that other school, this is the wrong ap-
proach.
The Florida education system is fall-
ing into the hole compared to the north-
ern and western states. We are extremely
low-ranked on the teacher salaries, badly
ranked with primary education and talk
to me about the budget issue. While UF is
suffering budget cuts, FSU and USF are too.
Personally, I don't think we should need
the recognition to be the best in the state,
and we should prove it to everyone else by
being more successful.
Why don't we spend more time writing
bills for the state to increase teacher pay
and school funding? Let's prove that we
are indeed the best university in Florida by
making amends to what is already wrong
with the state, and let our reputation speak
for itself. Go Gators!

Hall may not open for fall
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Construction of UF's home
for the Hough Graduate
School of Business is sched-
uled to be finished this sum-
mer, but the building could
remain closed in the fall due
to lack of state funding.
William R. Hough Hall, the
$23 million building next to
Criser Hall, would not receive
operating and maintenance
funds from the state under the
Florida House of Representa-
tives' state budget proposal.
Hough donated $10 mil-
lion for the building's $23 mil-
lion construction. The remain-
ing $13 million was covered
by Public Education CapitalOutlay, a statewide trust fund
for construction at universi-
ties, schools and community
colleges.
Although the construction
costs are covered, UF does
not currently
have a plan
for funding
the build-
ing's opera-
tion costs if

Machend o e s n ' t
come, said
Ed Poppell, vice president for
administrative affairs.
Both chambers of the Leg-
islature passed their budgets
last week, setting the stage
for negotiations in the coming
days.The cost of keeping the
lights on is usually covered
by the state, according to UF
Chief Financial Officer Matt
Fajack.
The Senate budget pro-
vides for the operating and
custodial costs of Hough Hall,
but the House budget does
not.
"The Senate bill, in all
categories, is better than the
House bill," Fajack said.
UF President Bernie Ma-
chen said in an interview last
week that he hopes the Legis-
lature doesn't force the uni-
versity into such a situation.
"It would be a horrible sto-
ry to have a beautiful building
there with nobody in it," he
said.
Gator grad creates video game
* THE GAME IS BEING DEVELOPED FOR
XBOX 360 AND PLAYSTATION 3.
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Jeremy Stieglitz was an undergraduate
student at UF, he didn't spend his weekends par-
tying. He was sitting in his apartment coding for
video games.
Five years later, Stieglitz, 26, is the co-founder
and development director of Trendy Entertain-
ment, a Gainesville-based video game studio that
is currently developing its first game to be sold for
Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. "Dungeon Defend-
ers" is an action game in which the player must
protect his or her tower from invading creatures.
Stieglitz described the game as "Lord of the Rings
meets Saturday morning cartoons."
"Dungeon Defenders" will be available for
digital download from the Xbox Live Marketplaceand Playstation Network Store in July for less than
$20, Stieglitz said.
"We're producing value-oriented games for
digital download," he said.
Along with "Dungeon Defenders," Trendy
Entertainment is also working on a new technol-
ogy called VisionPlay, which would allow any
consumer webcam and PC to render full motion
analysis for video games.
Stieglitz is one of six other UT graduates among
the 17 employees who
Spotlight on the make up Trendy Enter-
Swamp tainment. He co-founded
the company in January
with Agapitus Lye, a 2006 UF graduate who is a
CEO for the company.
As the CEO for Trendy Entertainment, Lye
handles the business side of the studio, such as
finding investors for their projects.
Lye said that one of the goals of Trendy Enter-
tainment is creative independence.
"We want complete creative control," Lye
said.17-

UF TRACK AND FIELD
Gators set two school records at Florida Relays
RYAN BUTLER
Alligator Writer
UF ended the Florida Relays
in a deserving fashion -with a
standing ovation from a near-ca-
pacity crowd.
The men's and women's track
and field teams combined to win
10 events and set two school re-
cords at the two-day meet, capped
off by the men's 4x400-meter re-
lay that brought the 4,000-plus at
Pressly Stadium to its feet.
In that event, the quartet of
R.J. Anderson, Tony McQuay,
Christian Taylor and Calvin Smith
took the race with a school-record
3:00:31, setting the best time in the
world so far in 2010.
"It felt like winning a national
championship," said Taylor, a two-
time triple jump national cham-
pion and member of UF's recent
indoor national title team.
After Taylor cemented the lead
Anderson and McQuay built over
professional track club GW Ex-
press, Smith ran a blazing final lap
to finish first by more than a sec-
ond and beat third-place Delaware
State by more than six.
The event garnered the loudestcheers of the weekend, but don't
count UF head coach Mike Hollo-
way among the dazzled.
"We're going to put three-flat
in the media guide and move on,"
Holloway said. "I'll guarantee you
we're not throwing a party next
week."
"Overall, from top to bottom,
I'm extremely pleased," he added.
"Our team came out with a lot of
pride and passion, and that's what
UF is all about."
In a showcase meet for one of
the nation's premier track pro-
grams, the men's sprinters routine-
ly put up eye-popping numbers.
They swept the 4x400, 4x200 and
4x100 relays, wining all in domi-
nant fashion.
Smith anchored the 4x200 be-
hind McQuay, Jeremy Hall and
Terrell Wilks. They finished in
1:20:38, setting the meet, track and
school record and the best time in
the world of the 2010 season.
The defending NCAA-cham-
pion 4x100 team won in 38:93.
Jeff Demps anchored the race be-
gun by Jeremy Rankin, Hall and
Wilks with a clear path toward the
world's second-best time in 2010.

Florida shut out in finale
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
The Gators' bats remained silent long
after Easter service ended Sunday.
No. 8 Florida (20-7, 6-3 Southeastern
Conference) was shut out for the first time
this season in a 7-0 loss to Vanderbilt. The
No. 17 Commodores (24-6, 5-4 SEC) lim-
ited the Gators to five hits, preventing UF
from sweeping its third series of the year.
Jack Armstrong, Vanderbilt's No. 3
starter, shut Florida's offense down. The
Gators entered Sunday averaging 7 runs
per game, but Armstrong held them to
four hits in six innings.
"Their pitcher did a nice job," UF
coach Kevin O'Sullivan said. "He battled
and put the ball in play, but we certainly
had our opportunities. You lookback on a
Sunday and only have five hits, it's going
to be tough to win any game, let alone a
Sunday game."The 6-foot-6 Armstrong relied on his
two-seam fastball, which sinks as it ap-
proaches the plate and hits the mid-90s.
The downward spin on the pitch fooled
Florida hitters, as 11 of the 16 balls in play
were grounders.
Armstrong, a Jupiter native who was
recruited by UF, struck out four and said
the 77-degree temperature helped him
shut down the Gators.
"My arm moves a
little better," he said. "It's
just that Florida weather.
I'm used to it."Baseball Florida starter Hud-
son Randall, on the other
hand, did struggle with the heat. Randall
used his slider for most of the game, try-
ing to get the Commodores' hitters to
chase pitches out of the strike zone.
He was successful and recorded a
season-high six strikeouts. But deep pitch
counts tired Randall, and he was pulled

* THE GATORS SWEPT THE TIGERS
IN GAINESVILLE.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
LSU came into Gainesville riding a na-
tion-best 24-game winning steak, and left
on a three-game losing streak.
The No. 12 Tigers' (29-7, 8-3 Southeast-
ern Conference) dominating pitching staff,
which started the series with an NCAA-
best .72 ERA, was tagged for seven runs
Sunday and 13 in the series as No. 6 Flor-
ida (27-4, 9-2 SEC) earned a three-game
sweep with a 7-1 win in the finale.
"It's a huge series win and something
to be proud of for the whole year," UF
coach Tim Walton said.
The Gators'pitchers outperformed their
highly touted counterparts, as Stephanie
Brombacher and Ensley Gammel allowed
only one earned run during a combined 21
innings pitched.
The duo also recorded 15 strikeouts
while limiting the number of walks to just
four.
"I'm always more impressed with the
pitching because the pitching is going towin us championships," Walton said.
Although Sunday's game ended as a
blowout, it was highly contested through
the first five and a half innings.
The Gators got the scoring started in
the bottom of the second when junior Aja
Paculba singled in Corrie Brooks to give
UF a 1-0 lead.
Florida added to its advantage in the
third, when freshman Brittany Schutte's
two-run homer made
the score 3-0.
"This weekend, I'd
been struggling a lot so
I was just trying to settle
down and see my pitch
and help contribute
like I had been doing,"
Walton Schutte said of her home
run.
Schutte's blast came on an afternoon in
which she was starting her third game in
less than 24 hours behind the plate in the
place of injured Tiffany DeFelice.
"It's been a little rough on the body,"
Schutte said. "But I'm used to catching so I
just gotta get back in the swing of things."
Brombacher got the start Sunday but

Men, women top Kentucky
By ANDREW OLSON
Alligator Writer
The Gators men's tennis team has grown
and proven it can win under the most dif-
ficult of circumstances.
No. 6 UF (15-2, 7-0 Southeastern Confer-
ence) edged out a 4-3 victory over No. 10
Kentucky (16-7, 5-3 SEC) to give the team
it's first win against a top-10 opponent in a
true road environment.
The win over coach Andy Jackson's
alma mater also marked the first time on
the road this season that Florida has won
four singles matches after losing the dou-
bles point.
The last time the Gators lost the doubles
point in a road environment, the singles
matches did not go so well either.
The loss came on Jan. 24th against then-
No. 6 Baylor. Down 1-0 the team lost four
of six singles matches to lose 5-2.
Three of the newcomers who lost their
singles matches at Baylor (Sekou Bangoura
Jr., Bob Van Overbeek and Nassim Slilam)
were key contributors in Sunday's win at
Kentucky.
Bangoura put the first Florida point on
the board with a 6-3, 6-1 win at the No. 6
spot.
No. 7 junior Alexandre Lacroix had his
nine-match winning streak
snapped on court No. 1 in
a 7-6, 6-4 loss to No. 13 Eric
Tennis Quigley.
Van Overbeek tied the
match up with a 6-3, 6-4 win
at the No. 4 position.
Van Overbeek is the only member of the
team undefeated in SEC singles competi-
tion this season.
After sophomore Joey Burkhardt
dropped his match at court No. 2 to No.
44 Alex Musialek, the Gators needed two
of their French imports to pull through in
pressure situations.
On court No. 3, senior Antoine Ben-
neteau needed three sets to get the 6-4, 3-6,
6-3 win that tied the match at 3-3.
The deciding point came from another
match that went three sets. Slilam came
through with a 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 win to keep UF
unbeaten in SEC play.
The men's squad, undefeated on its home
court this season, returns to Gainesville for
the last three matches of the regular season,
starting with the two other teams undefeat-
ed in conference play, No. 3 Tennessee and
No. 8 Georgia.
The No. 3 women's squad (18-2, 8-0SEC) sent out seniors Anastasia Revzina
and Marrit Boonstra with a 4-0 win over
Kentucky (2-16, 0-8 SEC) in an abbreviated
match on Sunday.
Due to Kentucky's travel plans, singles
matches were not played out once UF
clinched the victory. Revzina and Boon-
stra's matches were among those that did
not finish.
"It's alright," said Revzina about not
finishing her singles match. "Senior Day is
not about winning or losing.
"It's about the whole team being there
for you."
Her fellow senior brought up the point
that despite the Senior Day ceremony, it
may not be their last match at home.
"We're hoping to host an NCAA Re-
gional," Boonstra said. "I'd like to go out
playing better tennis in Regionals."
The team will close out its regular sea-
son with a three-match road trip to No.
14 Tennessee, No. 13 Georgia and No. 19
South Carolina.
Golf team starts last tourney before SECs
With the Southeastern Conference
Championship Tournament less than two
weeks away, the Florida men's golf team
has one last chance to get back on track for
competition after a strand of poor perfor-
mances.
The Gators will start com-
petition today at the Bancorp
Golf South Intercollegiate Tourna-
ment in Jackson, Miss. at the
Reunion Golf and Country
Club course.
This will be the Gators' last event of the
spring before the SEC Championship Tour-
nament.
UF has finished seventh, 14th and eighth
in its three competitions since winning the
SunTrust Gator Invitational in Gainesville
on Feb. 14.
The Gators were ranked No. 3 after fin-
ishing first in the tournament but have fell
since then.
Even with their fall in the rankings, they
will still be the highest-ranked team in the
tournament.
The two-day event is hosted by Ole Miss
and will feature 15 teams, four of which are
from the SEC, including Florida, Ole Miss,
Mississippi State and Vanderbilt.
The Gators will start with a shot-gun
round and complete 36 holes on Monday
before playing the final round of the tour-
nament on Tuesday.

after throwing 93 pitches in 5.2 in-

"With the heat and the pitch count, I
wasn't getting many quick outs," Ran-
dall said. "It was definitely wearing on
me.",
Randall allowed seven hits, but VU
managed just two earned runs. The
freshman's only mistake was hanging a
first-pitch slider to Commodores third
baseman Jason Esposito, who pulled
the ball past the left-field bleachers for
the first of two solo homers.
"We got a good, quality start from
Hudson Randall," O'Sullivan said. "Hepitched us into the sixth inning and did
a nice job. Other than the one pitch to
Esposito, I thought he threw the ball re-
ally, really well."
While the Gators' offense only
managed five hits, the team did have
chances to reach home. Florida lead-off
hitters reached base in four-straight in-
nings.
Shortstop Nolan Fontana and first
baseman Preston Tucker reached sec-
ond and third in the sixth, but second
baseman Josh Adams grounded out to
end the frame.
"Today we didn't play too well,"
Fontana said, "and we got it handed

UF LACROSSE
Gators' defense carries team to first conference win
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Florida finally got the monkey off its
back Saturday.
After two unsuccessful chances to win
a conference game, UF took down No. 14
Penn State 13-11 in Gainesville.
Freshman attacker Ashley Bruns led
the team with four scores and two assists,
while attacker Janine Hillier added two
goals. Midfielders Caroline Chesterman
and Brittany Dashiell each accounted for
two scores.The Gators' (8-4, 1-2 American La-
crosse Conference) defense made the
difference, shutting down the Nittany
Lions' top scorer, Molly Fernandez, and
containing their other threats.
Florida used defender Haydon Judge
to frustrate Fernandez, and she managed
to limit Fernandez's stat line to just one
yellow card. UF held PSU (6-4, 0-2 ALC)
to one of six free-position shot conver-
sions and zero shot attempts in the first
13 minutes of the game.
Coach Amanda O'Leary said she put
Judge on Fernandez because of her tenac-ity, quick feet and speed
"Haydon did a really good job on
her," O'Leary said. "She took Molly out
Bruins
er the Nittanyof her game a little bit,
but it's a total team effort
out there, and you can't
focus on one player, but
we did a super job on
her."
UF got off to a quick
4-0 start, clogging the
12-meter arc whenev-
Lions drove toward the
goal, but at the half, the teams were tiedat six. The game came down to the final
30 minutes when the Gators' aggressive
play helped them hold on despite being
matched in shots (13), ground balls (five)
and draws (six) in the second half.
"The defense stepped up and gave me
the chance to make the angle saves that
I needed," said goalkeeper Cara Caning-
ton, who recorded eight saves. "With this
team, we didn't want to put them on the
eight-meter (arc), but if we had to, it was
good that they were putting them on the
side and giving me the angle to make the
save a little easier."
Women take first, second in shot put
TRACK, from page 14
six. Taylor finished in a time of 45.55, while
Smith was second in 45.62 seconds.
"I have the best training group in the
world, and that puts me at an advantage,"
Taylor said.
The women's team put up several im-
pressive performances of its own. Julie
Northrup won the steeplechase in 10:29:22,
breaking the meet record set by teammate
Genevieve LaCaze at last year's Florida Re-
lays.
Mariam Kevkhishvili, a four-time
NCAA champion, and Keely Medeirosfinished first and second for the Gators in
shot put. Evelien Dekkers won the javelin
for the fourth-straight year, finishing with
a throw of 49.97 meters.
Middle-distance runner Charlotte
Browning continued her
great 2010 by winning the
800-meter run. The NCAA
indoor champion in the mileTrack ran neck-and-neck with
Western Kentucky's Vasity
Chemweno for most of the race before pull-

hit ball in favor of freshman Ensley
Gammel, who gave up an unearned
run in the fourth due to an error by
Megan Bush but settled down and al-
lowed just one base runner the rest of
the way.
It was not until the bottom of the
sixth that UF extended its lead from 3-1to 7-1, as Gammel, Paculba, sophomore
Michelle Moultrie and senior Francesca
Enea all had RBI hits to give the Florida
lead some extra cushion.
"Their pitchers were making good
pitches but every time they put a ball a
little bit over the plate we found a way
