Kanapaha Middle School was evacuated for 
about an hour and a half Monday morning after 
a bomb-threat hoax left Alachua County Sher-
iff’s Ofﬁ  ce deputies and school staff sweeping 
the area for explosives.
Alachua County Sgt. Becky Butscher said the 
school received the phone threat Friday but did 
not report it until about 9 a.m. Monday, when 
staff ﬁ  rst heard the 3-day-old voicemail. Police responded as students and faculty were evacu-ated to the school’s track ﬁ  eld, where they are trained to go in emergency situations. 
Butscher said the department’s bomb squad 
was not called out because there were no suspi-
cious items indicating a bomb. Instead, depu-
ties and staff members conducted a physical search. 
“It was very calm and smooth,” she said of 
the sweep at the school.
Butscher said this was the ﬁ  rst bomb threat 
the department has received this school year. 
“We don’t want it to happen very often, but 
it is somewhat of a frequent thing that occurs at 
schools,” she said. 
Threats typically come in on the last day of 
school, Butscher said, like before summer or 
Spring Break. 
She said if people hear of a bomb threat, they 
should avoid panicking. 
“That’s the worst thing to do,” she said.Middle school

Early voting for the 2014 general elec-
tion will begin Wednesday and run until 
Nov. 1, said Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter.
“Here in Alachua County, we found 
that a lot of our voters are excited to have the opportunity to have an alternate way to cast their ballot,” Carpenter said. “They’re taking advantage of going to the early voting sites to cast a ballot on their own schedule.”
Voters can locate their designated 
polling sites on the Vote Alachua website. They can also check their voter registra-tion status and track absentee ballots as they are processed.
On the ballot are U.S. representatives 
for Districts 3 and 5, governor, attorney general, chief ﬁ  nancial ofﬁ  cer, commis-sioner of agriculture, state representatives for Districts 10, 20 and 21, District Court of Appeal, District 1 County Commissioner, District 2 County Commissioner, District 4 County Tax Collector and High Springs 
City Commission.Three amendments are presented in 
this year’s election. Amendment 1 would 
connect Florida real-estate sales to con-servation funding, which could amount to about $1 billion annually in restoration projects. Amendment 2 would legalize 
medical marijuana, and Amendment 3 
would allow the elected governor to ap-point new state Supreme Court justices as current ones complete their terms or man-datorily retire at 70.
There are 74,583 registered Democrats 
in Alachua County, 45,132 registered Re-publicans and 38,326 registered as other, 
according to the Vote Alachua website.

� THEY ARE GETTING 
COWS FOR A CREAMERY.
CHABELI HERRERA
Alligator Staff Writer
cherrera@alligator.org
In a push for added sustain-
ability, the lush vegetables and 
bright flowers that grow on the seven farmed acres at Swal-lowtail Farm in Alachua will 
be joined by four new mooing 
members come January. 
The 5-year-old farm will 
be adding a creamery to its landscape early next year, ser-viced by the four new cows along with its current Dexter cow and calf pair: 2-year-old Grainne and 4-month-old Brie.
Founder Noah Shitama 
said the idea of the creamery has been a work in progress for the last year, with the goal of the farm becoming completely self-sustainable. 
“I feel like that kind of gets 
at the heart of what the lo-cal food situation is about, for 
consumers to be able to have 
a good trusted source for their food,” said Shitama, 35.
Fellow Swallowtail farmer 
Emily Eckhardt, who will be managing the creamery once it’s in business, spent the last six months training through an apprenticeship with Tem-
ple-Wilton Community Farm 
in New Hampshire to learn dairy farming and animal hus-bandry.
This January, she expects to 
extract about 8 gallons of milk per day to make cheese, butter and yogurt.
For now, the dairy prod-
ucts made at the creamery can only be sold to pets because of a Florida law that makes it illegal for farms to sell unpas-teurized milk without a federal license. 
“For us, it will be a very slow build,” Eckhardt, 29, said. “I believe in raw milk. I feel like it’s the healthiest thing. I also believe that we need to do 
it right.”
She said the farm will look 
into obtaining a license in the 
future to sell dairy products to customers. 
In the meantime, the new 
cows will primarily serve to create usable manure to fertil-ize the crops.
“No one else in our area is 
really attempting that kind of farming right now,” Eckhardt said.
The farm will launch a 
crowd-funding campaign in the next two weeks on barn-raiser.us to build the creamery and buy a new delivery vehi-
cle that would help fulfill the 
farm’s growing demand. 
Shitama, who is a 
Gainesville native, started the community-supported agri-culture farm with only one acre of cultivated land and 30 shareholding households — “shares” the farm sells to the 
public in return for delivering 
a box of seasonal produce to the houses at regular intervals.
Now Swallowtail services 
about 240 households and sells produce to local farmer’s mar-ket patrons and Gainesville restaurants like the Top and Satchel’s Pizza. 
On Monday afternoon, Shi-
tama fed grain to light brown Grainne as calf Brie snuggled close to her mother and shied away from his other out-stretched hand.
“She’s kind of a diva cow,” 
he said of Grainne.  
Looking forward, Shitama 
said the cow will be a large part of Swallowtail’s ultimate goal.
“We are striving to be the 
first farm in our area to offer a whole diet,” he said.Local farm making

An associate professor in the UF 
College of Education was honored 
by two professional teacher organi-
zations for her work in the science 
education field.
Rose Pringle was awarded the 
John Shrum Award by the Southeast-ern Association for Science Teacher Education and the Mary L. Collins Award for Excellence in Teacher Ed-ucation by the Florida Association of Teacher Educators.
Since 2000, Pringle has worked at 
UF as an assistant and associate pro-
fessor teaching both graduate and 
undergraduate students. She said her goal is to make teachers comfort-able with the content they teach and learn to engage students to learn and see science as a greater good.
“So it’s not just something from a 
textbook,” she said. “Science is big-ger than that. It is understanding your world... You develop habits of mind — of thinking.”
Founded in 1991, the John Shrum 
Award recognizes individuals with 
a lifelong com-
mitment to sci-ence education, 
participation and 
leadership.
For both 
awards, Pringle was nominated by her students.
She was cho-
sen for the Collins Award by doc-toral student Natalie Ridgewell.
“In every capacity, Dr. Pringle 
strengthens both our program and field, and she helps to create an outstanding learning community,” Ridgewell said.
The award is an honor presented 
to educators who made impacts on teacher education in Florida.
Pringle grew up in Jamaica. She 
said she knew she wanted to become a teacher because she was the oldest and always taught younger ones.
“Where I grew up, teaching was 
the ideal profession,” she said.
She said she taught high school 
biology, chemistry and integrated science in Jamaica. Then, through a fellowship, she attended Florida State University where she received her master’s and doctorate in sci-ence education.
One of her goals is to increase the 
participation of minority popula-tions in science and education.
“Teachers have to realize they are 
very powerful in changing the lives of kids,” she said. “It’s not easy if you want to be an effective science education teacher. I am constantly working, but it is worth it.”
For now, Pringle works in Nor-
man Hall with her awards tucked away in her office drawer.
“They do not define who I am,” 
Pringle said. “What defines me is the passion that I take to my work.”UF professor recognized for her

Ben Knazick, 24-year-old co-owner of Video Rodeo on West University Avenue, works at 
the store on Monday afternoon. The store will be moving to 10 E. University Ave.

Alligator Staff Writer ppinak@alligator.org
Collin Whitlock remembers the night 
a homeless man wandered into Video 
Rodeo with his only possession: a guitar.
Whitlock, one of the video rental 
shop’s co-owners, played music with the 
man, and together the odd pair watched 
movies through the night.
The memory is just one among many 
Whitlock will bring with him to Video Rodeo’s new downtown location come December. 
In order to reel in new customers and 
save money, the rental shop is relocating to 10 E. University Ave. and leaving be-
hind its old location at 1119 W. University 
Ave., where it has conducted business for the last 10 years. 
“Downtown is really an evolving 
neighborhood,” he said. “We want to be a part of the changing and shaping of it.”
Whitlock said the store’s downtown 
lease will be $200 less per month than its current rent. None of the store’s employ-
ees — who are all considered co-owners 
— earn a steady wage, he said.
“Most of the people who work here 
have other jobs,” Whitlock said. “It’s something that we’re kind of passionate 
about.”
The cramped yet quiet store will also 
have twice the amount of space at its 
new location, near the Pop-A-Top con-venience store. Whitlock said this will enable Video Rodeo to buy and display more films and books. The shop current-ly stocks almost 8,000 films and almost 700 books.
Video Rodeo will hold onto most of 
its furniture, including its signature red, metal shelves, he said.  
UF journalism junior Kevin Sathyanath 
said he stumbled upon the store while walking down West University Avenue a 
few years ago. He said his favorite genre 
is Japanese fiction.
“They have a different selection,” the 
20-year-old said. “Their books are based much more on movies.”
Sathyanath said he likes support-
ing the local store and will visit its new downtown location. He also said the prices are cheap — he bought all of the 
Chronicles of Narnia books there for $3.
“It’s a casual atmosphere that’s much 
more local and friendly than other 
stores,” Sathyanath said.Video Rodeo moving to East University Avenue in DecemberALEXIA FERNANDEZ

UF course evaluations roll 
around at the end of every term. 
Although some students may 
overlook them, faculty depend on 
them.
Student ratings not only deter-
mine whether a professor will re-
ceive tenure, they also affect their 
future promotions or teaching awards.
Faculty researchers from the 
University of California, Berkeley 
found that student evaluations are 
not the best method to rate profes-sors and courses.
The study did find that students are in a good position to observe some aspects of teaching, includ-ing clarity, pace, legibility and 
their own excitement or boredom.
But, according to the study, stu-
dents cannot rate effectiveness — 
regardless of their intentions. 
“We don’t measure teaching ef-
fectiveness,” the report read. “We measure what students say, and pretend it’s the same thing. We cal-culate statistics, report numbers, 
and call it a day.”
Angel Kwolek-Folland, UF as-
sociate provost for academic and 
faculty affairs, said course evalu-
ations are extremely important 
when considering the work of the faculty the university hires.“Our creditors expect us to 
have standards for our faculty,” she said. “We also have high stan-
dards as a university and require 
our professors to meet those stan-dards.”
While faculty members are 
expected to meet the teaching re-quirements of the university, the 
process of obtaining course evalu-
ations from students is a difficult one.Edit Nagy, a lecturer in the Col-
lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences, has received less online evalua-tions from students within the last few years than she did when they 
were paper-based.
“I wouldn’t say it’s better, but 
it is different,” she said. “There’s 
no exact time to tell students to fill out an evaluation form. When they 
were paper-based, we could have 
them fill it out during class.”
Nagy said most students who 
fill out evaluations fit an extreme 
end of a spectrum: those who re-
sponded well to a professor and a course, and those who did not.
Smaller classes, she said, leave 
more chances to interact with stu-
dents while larger classes make it 
different to be open with a larger audience.A native of Hungary, Nagy said 
she has received unfair evaluations from students based on uncontrol-lable factors, such as her accent.
“I have had some misunder-
standings with students,” she said. “Sometimes my accent is an issue. The worst situation is when you have a small class and you only re-ceive one evaluation.”
Students are not required to 
complete faculty evaluation forms, but Carmen Lopez-Ramirez, a 21-year-old UF Spanish senior, 
said it doesn’t hurt to fill one out 
when there is an incentive.
“I’ve had some professors of-
fer extra credit or extra points on the final exam if we filled out the 
evaluation form,” she said. “For 
the most part, though, I’ll try to fill one out for every class.”UC Berkeley study questions validity of student evaluations

WILL WORK ON THE PROJECTS.

UF and the Florida Department of Agriculture and 
Consumer Services have received more than $4.57 million 
to study specialty crops in Florida.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grants will fund 
research for 34 Florida projects, including 24 studies by the 
UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.  
Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced about 
$118 million in grants to state agricultural departments to 
improve specialty crops, according to the USDA. 
Mary Duryea, a professor and associate dean for re-
search with the UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sci-ences said with the grant, UF/IFAS can focus on Florida’s specialty crops such as blueberries and strawberries.
“Florida is a leader as a specialty crop state,” Duryea said. “We’re No. 1 in the U.S. in production of oranges, grapefruits, tropical foliage, sweet corn, sugar cane, beans, green beans, bell peppers, watermelons and tomatoes.”
One project will focus on strawberry breeding. The 
study will look into gene sequencing to strengthen straw-berries against disease and increase their production. Elise Stoddard, a 22-year-old agricultural education and com-munication junior, said people often underestimate how 
much the USDA contributes to agricultural research. 
“The fact that we are getting that large a sum in grants 
is a great way to show the USDA’s support in what we are 
doing,” she said. 
Duryea said that she is excited that these grants will 
be supporting IFAS’s many research goals. More than 400 researchers will be working on these projects, studying topics like genetically altering crops to increase yield and to make better quality, sweeter strawberries.
In a press release, UF senior vice president for agri-
culture and natural resources Jack Payne said the awards show UF and IFAS are vital to the agricultural needs of Florida and the country.USDA grants $4.57 million to projectsCarney will be paid

Flayman said.
As a journalist, he covered the fall of the Soviet Union in 
1990 and the impeachment and trial of President Bill Clinton. 
He was on Air Force One with Bush on Sept. 11. 
“He has unparalleled experience and insight that nobody 
else has, and I can’t wait to hear it,” said Brandon Scott, a 21-year-old political science and economics senior.
In 2008, Carney became Vice President Joe Biden’s commu-
nications director, and in 2011, Obama asked him to become press secretary. In May, he stepped down as press secretary.
“The moment he stepped down, I was instantly interested 
and started inquiring for him to come speak at UF,” Flayman said.
Students can participate in a Q-and-A after Carney’s

UF Institute of Food and Ag-
ricultural Sciences is working to 
recruit students to fill the short-age of young professionals in the agricultural industries. 
A STEM Food & Ag Council-
sponsored report released at the World Food Prize Borlaug Dialogue symposium in Des Moines, Iowa, last week found there is a national decline of students entering the food and agricultural fields. 
Elaine Turner, dean of the 
UF College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, said IFAS is doing its best to draw more students into the professions. 
“There is and will continue to 
be high demand for profession-als in the food and agriculture fields,” Turner said. “The good news is that there is interesting and exciting careers available.”The report included that 
nearly 34,000 people were hired 
each month in the food and 
agriculture industries between January and August 2014. A 
quarter of the workers are 55 or 
older. 
The report projects a 4.9 
percent growth in employment opportunities in the next five years, adding 33,100 new jobs in advanced agriculture fields.  
Turner said some majors 
in IFAS have as few as 30 stu-dents. 
“There is reassurance for jobs 
when these students graduate,” Turner said. “They can make a good living while also making a difference in the world.”Charles Sims, a professor 
of food science, is involved in 
food safety and security from 
harvesting to consumption. He said the food science job market 
cannot find enough people to 
take much needed positions.
“The demand will not di-
minish due to the advancing 
technology in agriculture all 
around the world,” he said.
Christian Mignano, a 
23-year-old UF agricultural op-
erations management senior, 
said the findings in the report 
are one of the reasons he got 
into production agriculture. 
“No longer is the farmer 
who grows your food the old 
man in overalls with a pitch-
fork in his hand and straw in 
his teeth,” Mignano said. “The amount of science and technol-ogy that goes into agriculture is 
astonishing and filled with op-
portunities for our generation 
to define ourselves as leaders.”Food field lacking STEM students

A UF student was arrested at Gator 
Growl after he tried to jump a fence 
to gain entry, failed, then punched a University Police officer in the face.
Tyler J. Blair 
was seen climbing 
a fence to Flavet Field with two women in order to avoid entrance fees shortly after 8 p.m. 
Friday, according 
to a report. When Officer Busatta 
approached the 21-year-old and the two women, both women ran away. Instead of running with them, Blair walked toward Busatta. 
When the officer identified him-
self and told Blair he could only gain 
access to Growl at the main entrance, 
the man took a step toward Busatta and yelled, “I pay tuition,” before try-ing to climb the fence again. The officer tried to get Blair off the 
fence when he swung around and started punching Busatta in the face — ultimately causing Blair and the of-ficer to fall to the ground. 
While struggling on the ground, 
Blair grabbed Busatta’s police radio and broke it, taking away the officer’s ability to call for backup, a report 
said. The man then grabbed the of-
ficer’s hat and flashlight. With Blair still grabbing at the officer’s belt and hitting him, Busatta used his Taser. 
Blair then ran away with the offi-
cer’s flashlight and hat, and Busatta began to chase him on foot. 
The man was caught as he was 
trying to enter UF’s Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon fraternity chapter’s on-campus 
house. 
Blair was arrested on charges of 
battery on an officer, resisting arrest with violence, robbery, criminal mis-chief and depriving an officer of a means of communication. 
Blair was released Saturday at 
about 4:30 p.m. on a $40,000 bond.UF student punches cop

Lately, Americans sound like a bunch of irrational 
nincompoops.Yes, I said it. The recent mass hys-teria over three — yes, three — conﬁ  rmed cases of 
Ebola sent Americans into a frenzy. Airline passengers are showing up to airports in homemade Hazmat suits, cable news is treating Ebola as if it’s spread to every corner of the contiguous U.S. and now ABC is prepping a minise-ries based on the book “The Hot Zone.”
For the love of all that is holy, can we all please calm 
down?
Yes, Ebola is a terrifying virus that can kill with incred-
ible speed and viciousness. Although the response to the 
initial infection in Dallas is frustrating, we have more to fear from our own panic than the virus itself. Sadly, fear, panic and mistrust seem to be the normal state of affairs in post-9/11 America, and the true effects are starting to rear their ugly heads.
A large percentage of UF students were in elementary 
school on September 11, 2001, a day that forever changed our country. It’s likely you’ve spent the majority of your life living in fear of terrorists, immigrants, exotic diseases and either Democrats or Republicans — depending on your political persuasion. Fear is paralyzing this nation and preventing us from accomplishing anything signiﬁ  -cant, which is a far more frightening prospect than three people contracting Ebola in the U.S.
Despite the spread of fear and loathing to every corner 
of the country, the recent inﬂ  ux of Ebola panic in the me-dia gives us all an opportunity to ﬁ  nally end a decade of artiﬁ  cially induced fright. The news may spread the narra-tive that society is on the brink of a chaotic meltdown, but we don’t have to listen.
In no way should we ignore threats to our country. We 
should do a better job preparing for the possibility of dead-ly infectious diseases, terrorist attacks and even another 
ﬁ  nancial crisis, but we shouldn’t sacriﬁ  ce our sanity as a 
result. We laugh at the doomsday predictors who grace television screens, but recently Americans have demon-strated that we’re woefully unprepared for a disaster.
Floridians are encouraged to prepare for hurricanes each and every year, but if a storm threatens us, it appears no one heeded the words of the gov-ernment or forecasters. 
People rush to grocery and 
hardware stores, stocking up on enough food and supplies to last until hurricane season in the year 2167. During the last hur-ricane threat, someone out there 
probably bought enough AA batteries to power a small country for a year.
That’s not preparing — that’s insanity.Put plainly, it’s a gross overreaction to a serious event, 
and it’s further evidence of how unprepared we all are. Three Ebola diagnoses in the U.S. should not generate the panic and fear we see. There’s no reason to wear a Hazmat suit on your next ﬂ  ight or withhold your child from school because one student 2,000 miles away may have been ex-posed to Ebola. That’s panic and overreaction, not prepa-ration.
If you’re panicking about Ebola, are you also panick-
ing about the ﬂ  u? We’ve had conﬁ  rmed cases of the ﬂ  u at 
UF — including that of a friend of mine — yet how many 
of you losing your sanity about Ebola received your free ﬂ  u shot from the Student Health Care Center? Getting a ﬂ  u shot to protect yourself and subsequently prevent the spread of the ﬂ  u is preparation and something we should do every year. It’s the same rationale behind preparing for hurricanes, even if one doesn’t hit Florida for another gen-eration.
Will Ebola spread and become the apocalyptic night-
mare people fear? Probably not, but anxiety over a poten-tial outbreak can ultimately hinder response and lead us down a more dangerous and threatening path. We can and should be prepared — within reason — for possible disasters, but if we succumb to fear, it seems likely our reactions to real crises may prove truly disastrous.

is not a gender-    
speciﬁ  c issue
In the wake of recent high-proﬁ  le cases of sexual assault against women on college campuses, including the inci-dents at UF in late August and early September, the issue 
has gained new importance among America’s youth.
Emma Watson’s much-celebrated speech at the U.N. and 
her subsequent launch of the HeForShe campaign encour-aged both males and females to join in the struggle for gender equality.
The efforts of Watson and other activists to engage men 
in the gender equality movement are admirable. However, such efforts often underplay or altogether ignore the extent to which some of the most important issues women face — par-ticularly sexual violence — affect men as well.
Incidents of sexual assault against male victims are much 
more common than many people realize. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN), about 10 percent of U.S. sexual assault victims are male. Last year’s National Crime Victimization Survey found that a stunning 38 percent of sexual violence cases involved male victims.
The issue of sexual assault against men is particularly prom-
inent in the U.S. military. In 2013, nearly 14,000 men said they were assaulted, compared to 12,000 women. Obviously, the fact that there are many more men than women in the armed 
forces skews these numbers. Regardless, they still show that 
rape and sexual assault are not single-gender issues.
On Saturday night, a man was sexually assaulted on the UF 
campus by another male.
University Police released a “timely warning” following 
the incident, which stated the victim chose not to pursue fur-ther law enforcement investigation of the assault.
Although it is impossible to speculate about this individu-
al’s reasons for declining an investigation, our society’s stigma 
against victims of rape and sexual assault deters thousands of 
individuals from even reporting such incidents.
Citing Justice Department statistics, RAINN has found that 
nearly 60 percent of cases of rape and sexual assault go unre-ported.
Many male victims of sexual assault experience the same 
psychological and emotional effects as female victims, includ-ing anxiety, depression and anger. Male victims may also grapple with additional suffering. They may question their 
sexuality and blame themselves for not being strong enough 
to ward off their attacker.
There is no doubt sexual assault primarily involves cases 
of male perpetrators and female victims. However, the recent incident at UF serves as a stark reminder that sexual assault can happen to anyone.
The fact that people of all genders can be victims of rape 
and sexual assault further reinforces the notion that each and every person has a role to play in the ﬁ  ght for equality. Such 
equality cannot be achieved until issues of sexual violence 
against all genders are acknowledged, respected and destig-matized.TUESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2014

Consider the following two events 
that transpired during UF’s Home-
coming week. First, the UF Board 
of Trustees selected Dr. Kent Fuchs to be the university’s next president. Second, I attended a UF-based talk which, among other things, alluded to the “innovative” 
research that could possibly be going on in 
the area of creating apps to remind people to brush their teeth.  Let’s now juxtapose these two aforementioned events that hap-pened on the UF campus last week with 
three history-making events that happened 
in the broader U.S. society in the same time frame. First, the deadly Ebola virus made its way to the U.S. Second, gas prices fell to 
levels not seen since 2010. Third, our stock 
market dropped by as much as 460 points. What a week!
While I whole-
heartedly endorse 
the selection of 
Dr. Fuchs as UF’s next president, as a member of Inno-
vation Gainesville’s local technology com-
munity and America’s broader technology industry, I would like to ask everyone to unretire the great humanities. Let’s bring them back to the workforce — in technol-
ogy companies, in particular, as well as all 
other businesses. Why? We need them. Ac-cording to the UF Center for the Humani-ties and the Public Sphere, it is the work 
of the humanities to help us critically think 
through life and labor. 
Technological innovation is a good 
thing. But is society better off with just tech-nology alone? No. Society is better served 
when both the humanities and technology 
are at the forefront of innovation. It’s ﬁ  ne to be excited over the fact that we can create something. However, it’s also important to 
consider whether we should create some-
thing. And if we believe we should, then we should also critically think through all of the intended consequences that could possibly arise from our creations before we 
make them. 
As I shared at the talk I attended last 
week, although I am an engineer, “I re-
fuse to use my humanities-dominant brain 
power to help companies create technology 
that remind people to brush their teeth.” You, the technology consumer, deserve better than that. If you agree that the hu-manities should be unretired and given the 
same attention as technological innovation, 
then please write to Dr. Fuchs, the new UF president — I already have. Let him know, that is enough! — everyone is now onboard 
to unretire the great humanities!

The middle of the Fall 2014 semester has ar-
rived. The middle of the semester signals the beginning of some wonderful things, 
such as the ability to start tentatively unpacking your sweaters in preparation for cooler weather and the onslaught of the pumpkin spice ﬂ  avor be-ing marketed in every single food product imag-
inable. There’s a whisper in the air of the holiday 
season just around the corner, when we can go home and blissfully forget about project deadlines.
However, it also signals the crunch time of the semester. 
Midterms are here, and your online class suddenly has ﬁ  ve 
assignments due in two weeks. When you ﬁ  nally get the 
chance to sit down and breathe, you realize, “Oh my God, it’s almost time to start picking classes for next semester.”
I feel that this semester has ﬂ  own by, and it’s been one of 
the most stressful semesters I’ve had yet. Comparing the se-mester’s trials and tribulations with friends, I ﬁ  nd that many students at UF are starting to feel a little exhausted, stressed and overworked.  Many of us are wondering if in the long run all of this work is really worth it.
Here is a message for everyone: You can do it.As a body of college students, we generally operate on 
minimal sleep. We occasionally manage an entire day’s worth of activities on nothing more than a large, iced coffee. 
We stuff our days full of meetings and classes and social ac-
tivities and return home at the end of the day with more than ﬁ  ve hours of homework to complete or lectures to study. We stay out all weekend and wake up for an 8:30 class Monday morning. We ﬁ  nish papers right before their due dates and 
cram for tests like our lives depend on it. College is hard. 
The middle of the semester is hardest because the buildup of living continuously on deadlines is ﬁ  nally starting to add up and weigh heavily on our shoulders.
Despite this, we can do it.Complaining about our classes is therapeutic in the short 
term. However, these classes and these tough and stressful situations will ultimately help us get where we want to be in life, whether that’s medical or law school, studying in a 
graduate program or starting a career. Sometimes, when we 
are so focused on the stressful aspects of life, we forget about what we are working toward.Ask yourself: Why are you here in school? 
What are you aiming for? Where do you want to be in 10 years? It’s totally ﬁ  ne to have no clue 
what you want to be when you grow up — I still 
don’t know myself.
Most people do have some idea of what they 
want their lives to be like, what they want to see 
when they look back on their college days in their 
— hopefully — old age. 
Remembering why we are here and what we want to do in 
the future can be a rallying cry to help pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off when the pressures of the semester start to 
become unbearable.
In the hard, dreary doldrums of the Fall semester, I urge 
everyone to remember why they want to be in college. I urge 
every student to say to themselves once a day, “I can do it.” 
Being able to attend college at all makes us incredibly fortu-
nate and privileged.
So many people around the world do not have the re-
sources we as students do or even the ability to pursue any education at all. Education is the most crucial and beneﬁ  cial 
opportunity that will be offered in our lifetime. Whether you 
are working for a speciﬁ  c degree or learning for learning’s sake, we are all lucky to be here at UF — despite the struggles of our football team.
I, like probably most college students, struggle frequently 
with procrastination. If you don’t, I commend you. Tell me your secrets.  
I’m going to make a conscious effort in the second half of 
the semester to remind myself, “I can do this.” I can succeed 
this semester and conquer it with the power of my pencil, my 
highlighter and my computer. I will put on some good study-ing music and stop procrastination in its lazy, meandering tracks. I will remember the goals and aspirations I’m work-
ing toward when it seems like studying for my next econom-
ics test is slowly killing me. 
Let’s all remind ourselves of these things because our edu-
cation is important and always will be.
Let’s remember that we can do this.

Florida voters will have the opportunity to legalize 
medical marijuana on Nov. 4, and a panel of experts 
presenting at UF hopes to educate the public about 
the issue.
“Legalize Marijuana? A Conversation with the Ex-
perts” will take place at 10 a.m. Friday at the Phillips 
Center for the Performing Arts.
The Florida Law Review organized the event, and 
it’s being sponsored by the Allen L. Poucher Legal Education Series.
“We feel that we don’t get much factual discussion 
about the issue,” said Dustin Mauser, a third-year UF 
law student who helped plan the event. “We hope 
to expect people who want to hear the facts of mari-juana.”
State voters have wavered on the issue this year. 
According to a Bob Graham Center for Public Service poll conducted in September in collaboration with a handful of other media outlets, 57 percent of respon-dents said they would vote yes on Amendment 2.
About two weeks before decision day, support 
seems to have dwindled, said Shelby Taylor, Bob 
Graham Center spokeswoman.
“The more information that’s out there, the more 
informed they can be,” Taylor said. “It could certainly 
change the mind of individuals. I don’t know that it’ll 
change the outcome.”
About 18 million people readily use marijuana 
each year, and 23 states have recently legalized its 
medical use. Washington and Colorado also legalized 
its recreational use.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2014

Gainesville residents now have the 
option of reporting non-emergency 
incidents to Gainesville Police online rather than by phone. 
GPD debuted its Online Crime Re-
porting Service on Monday, giving people the ability to report certain inci-dents on the department’s website.
Locals can report criminal mischief, 
damaged or lost property, fraudulent use of a credit card, harassing phone calls, prepaid credit or debit card scams and theft, a release said.
 “So much of our lives are lived 
online these days,” GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said in a statement. “Now you have the opportunity to in-
teract even more with the police depart-
ment by making reports online.” 
The online service is a direct and 
quick way to report crime, but it is strictly meant for non-emergencies where there is no need for an in-person 
officer.
Incidents that require immediate at-
tention or involve a known suspect or 
crime scene that could contain evidence important to investigators should be re-ported to 911 immediately.
If there is a firearm involved, people 
are also urged to directly report that to police using their phone instead of the 
online service. 
All online reports are reviewed by 
police officers, Tobias said. Making a 
false report is considered a crime.GPD launches online crime reportingCAMPUSNICOLE WIESENTHAL

Juan Serrano volunteers to comfort strang-
ers in their last moments.
Sometimes, he turns the TV on for them. 
Other times he reads books to them. Most of 
the time he just watches them take their final 
breaths.
“At first, you walk in, and the nurses were 
the ones who were with them before, and they 
introduce you,” Serrano, 21, said. “’This is the patient’s name; he or she had this disease, and this is happening.’”
Serrano acts as volunteer coordinator for 
No One Dies Alone, a UF Health Shands Hos-pital program that matches volunteers with 
dying patients to ensure they have comforting 
and dignified deaths.
At the moment of their deaths, the strang-
ers have no friends or family to be with them, 
said Serrano, a UF interdisciplinary studies se-nior. Sometimes family members can’t bear to watch their loved ones die.
During a usual shift, he’ll comfort an unre-
sponsive elderly patient who’s hooked up to numerous machines, he said. When the nurses have other patients to help, Serrano is left to 
offer his presence.
“If they’re unresponsive, it’s not like you 
can start playing the TV for them or singing to them,” Serrano said. “You’re just there to be a 
witness most of the time.”
He waits, holding the patients’ cracked 
hands, and watches the patients struggle to live, he said.
“They resign themselves to their fate,” he 
said. “The body always keeps struggling.”
In those final moments, Serrano is remind-
ed of his own mortality. He thinks about how 
he’s not going to live forever, and then he 
hears their last breaths.
“For those, it can be a breath every five 
minutes so you never know when it can end,” Serrano said. “It’s a process — never a mo-ment.”
He said the skin becomes a little whiter, the 
lips become pale and the breathing stops.
“Every time it makes me think, ‘This might 
be me one day,’” he said. “’Is this what I want? Will there be no one by my side? Volunteers? Family members?’ It’s hard not to think about yourself in that setting, but it’s relieving to know that they’re not suffering anymore.”
Debra Davis, NODA’s overseer, said she 
introduced the program five years ago when she was a new nurse. She said there was a pa-tient dying, and nobody could be with him. 
She felt like he should have someone with him 
at the end of his life.
“He was an older gentleman who was dy-
ing of advanced cancer,” she said. “He was having some difficulty breathing and seemed kind of scared, and he was alone.”
Most of the patients are unresponsive, she 
said, but volunteers can play music for them, read them religious passages if the patient is religious and hold their hands.
Meghan Pardo, who graduated with a 
health science degree from UF in May, recalls 
one volunteer session when she was asked to 
wet a woman’s mouth.
“I didn’t know how often it needed to be 
done, so I asked the nurse that,” the 22-year-old said. “And she said, ‘You know, as often as you’d like it to be done to you if you were in 
her position.’ That was the big teaching lesson 
that I use a lot now.”
The program has about 20 active volun-
teers, Serrano said, but he hopes more volun-teers will join in the spring.
Students who volunteer are often interest-
ed in going into the medical field.
“It helps you decide whether or not you 
really want to develop that career path,” said Janine Cruz, a UF Health Shands nurse. “It helps them understand really how important 
it is to show compassion at all times in their 
lives, especially when their lives are coming to an end.”
Davis said she has seen changes in the 
hospital staff since she implemented the pro-gram.
“I think the program has really inspired 
some of the nurses to be more sensitive to pa-tients at the end of life and to develop some unit initiative for patients at the end of life,” 
she said.
Nurses make blankets for patients and 
bring flowers and music to their bedsides 
now.
“It’s to bring more compassion and sensi-
tivity to people at the end of life,” she said.
Family members have expressed gratitude 
to volunteers for their services.
“If it’s traumatizing and daunting to me to 
see a total stranger die then how would it be for someone who’s known them for 20 years — who’s been with them for 40 years,” Ser-rano said.
He said one time an elderly woman sent 
him a “thank you” card for being with her dy-ing husband.
“She was so happy that when he passed 
someone was there to be with him in his final 
moments,” he said.
Volunteer shifts are usually three hours 
long, and volunteers can be called in six times 
a day or once a week. Volunteers can decide how often they’d like to be called in based on their schedule. Students interested in volun-teering can contact the UF Shands Volunteer Services Department. No One Dies Alone: A Shands program for dignified deaths

UF students can now follow 3 
billion data collections like they 
follow their favorite celebrities 
on Twitter.  
Students, faculty and staff with 
a UF email address have access to 
live data series from around the 
world with dataZoa. 
The resource allows users to 
create and customize their own 
personal dashboards of informa-tion that update automatically.
The aggregator uses govern-
ment and private sources to gath-er data on topics ranging from unemployment to weather, said Jay Kemp Smith, the creator of 
dataZoa. 
Through dataZoa, students 
can upload tables and charts to 
their iPhone or tablet. 
DataZoa is an excellent way 
for students to learn how to look at data for an employer in a vari-ety of fields, Smith said. UF’s Bureau of Economic and 
Business Research has used data-Zoa to create an online database about the state of Florida. Bureau Director Christopher McCarty 
said the data tool is valuable be-
cause it brings information like unemployment rates and income data together. 
“All those things are in bunch-
es of different places,” he said. “And you want to have them all on your space on dataZoa. A student might have different re-
search interests. They might want 
to maintain their own website with their own set of indicators that they’re interested in.”Smith said that a student’s 
ability to know how to use raw data could be useful in work-place.
UF business administration 
sophomore Colin Campbell said 
he agrees that the data program 
would be very valuable as an as-piring entrepreneur.
“Once summer comes around 
I will have time to do some per-sonal research,” he said, “and this data would be just as valuable to me if not more to my employer.”

Gainesville and UF orga-
nizations will come together 
Thursday to present a panel on domestic violence.
As part of Domestic Violence 
Awareness Month, groups will host the UF Panel on Violence Prevention and Resources in an hourlong program starting at 4 p.m. in Smathers Library, Room 100.
Alachua County Victim 
Services, University Police and others will present resources on 
domestic violence and sexual 
assault, said Jessie Lazarchik, the community education proj-ect coordinator with Alachua County Victim Services.
Naomi Phineas, the UPD 
victim advocate, said some may not recognize that they’re in an abusive relationship because 
they perceive abuse as purely 
physical attacks.
“It also includes psycho-
logical abuse, economic abuse and emotional abuse,” Phineas said.
Everyone, regardless of gen-
der or sexual orientation, can attend. 
Genevieve Schave, a 20-year-
old UF biology sophomore, said she plans on attending the 
panel so she can be prepared 
for any situation.
“The safety defense classes 
are kind of popular so this would be another resource that students would use if they had the choice,” Schave said.Groups to hold panel

AGAINST WILLIAM & MARY ON NOV. 14.

Alligator Staff Writer @EricaAlyssa 
No. 7 Florida has exactly 24 days 
until its first official game against 
William & Mary on Nov. 14. 
Coach Billy Donovan intends 
on using that time wisely. 
“We can play a game right now. 
We could play a game. I don’t know if there would be anything we would do very well,” Donovan 
said on Monday. “But we’ve got of-
fenses in, we have our press in, we 
have transition offense in, we’ve got different defensive things in. I think the only thing we probably 
don’t have in is zone defense, of-
fense against that.” 
The Gators held their first of-
ficial practice of the 2014-2015 
season on Friday, giving veteran 
coach Donovan a clear picture as 
to what his team needs to get done 
before that second Friday in No-vember. 
Getting the relatively young 
group on the same page is Dono-van’s main concern now. Catching new additions, like sophomore transfer John Egbunu, gradu-ate student transfer Jon Horford, freshman Chris Chiozza and fresh-man Devin Robinson, has been an expected struggle for the Gators. 
“They have no idea where to 
rotate or where they’re supposed to be,” Donovan said of the new-comers. “I always say with young guys sometimes young guys don’t communicate very well and part of the reason why they don’t com-municate very well is because they don’t know what they’re doing. So those guys have got to get better there.”
Full court press has been anoth-
er point of weakness that has stuck out to Donovan in the first three days of practice — one of which was a no contact day. He said the team is “not very good right now” 
in that aspect, but he noted it may 
be too early to break down the

UF has room to grow as practice begins

It was a late-August after-
noon in the Gale Lemerand 
practice gym, and starting 
setter Mackenzie Dagostino 
was explaining why Florida’s practices are never lackadaisi-cal.
“Your position is never set 
in stone,” the junior said. “Yes, you do have a starter, but you always have an opportunity to fight for a position.”
It’s safe to assume that Da-
gostino’s starting roster spot is cemented, as she recently racked up her 695th assist in 
Florida’s win over Arkansas 
on Sunday.
But now more than ever, 
Dagostino’s words can be applied to almost all of her 
teammates.
Two in particular are ju-
niors Gabby Mallette and 
Ziva Recek.
After hardly appearing 
in Florida’s pre-conference schedule and being benched against UF’s four top-15 ranked opponents, Mallette 
has recently stepped in as one 
of Florida’s reliable outside hitters.
Recek has also seen her 
contributions pick up signifi-cantly during the past week. After starting 31 of UF’s 32 
matches last season, the junior received only scattered play-ing time to begin this year. 
Since then, Recek has 
played more and finished with a season-high 12 kills on Wednesday in a win against South Carolina.
Coach Mary Wise attributes 
some of the lineup changes to matchup preferences and oth-ers to player performance.
“The luxury of having the 
depth is that we can go with outside hitters based on the matchup. That was the deci-
sion yesterday,” Wise said of 
UF’s win against Arkansas on Sunday. 
“And also we (can play) 
the hitter who has the hot 
hand.”

Recek’s playing time have in-
creased, opening day starter

On Friday, seven Gators stepped onto 
the Georgia Tech courts for the USTA/ITA 
Southeast Regional Championships.
Each was playing for a seat in the na-
tional championships in early November.
And by the time action ended on Sun-
day, the Gators earned three of the four 
seats in the singles semifinals draw in At-lanta. 
University of Georgia’s Lauren Her-
ring — the No. 1 seed in the singles draw 
— earned the fourth spot, which was soon taken away by UF’s freshman Josie Kuhl-man, 6-3, 6-2.
And on Monday morning, Kuhlman 
won the main draw singles title after play-ing a straight set against UF teammate Bri-anna Morgan, 6-2, 6-2.About an hour after 
Kuhlman’s victory, No. 
6 seed Gators tandem 
Brooke Austin and Kourt-ney Keegan walked on the same court and won 
the doubles title. 
The duo defeated 
teammates Peggy Porter 
and Kuhlman, 6-3, 6-3.
Like Herring from Georgia, the Univer-
sity of Miami tandem Stephanie Wagner and Lina Lileikite were the only pair not in  a Gators uniform in the doubles semi-finals.
Singles champion Kuhlman and dou-
bles winners Austin and Keegan earned the region’s qualifying spots in the 2014 USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate 
Championships in Flushing, New York.  
The tournament will take place in the 
USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis 
Center Nov. 6 through Nov. 9.

Across the back of Savannah Jordan’s 
neck, in ink, reads “The Dash.”
It signifies the dash in between the date 
someone was born and the date someone 
dies.
That dash represents a person’s life, what 
they accomplished in it and the impact they made on those around them.
Jordan wants her dash to be meaningful. 
She wants it to be spent playing the game she loves with the people who matter most to her, even if it wasn’t always the dash she envisioned.
With the raw talent and abilities that Jor-
dan displays on the soccer field for the Flori-da Gators, one would think that she was born juggling a soccer ball. That, however, was not the case by any means.
    
Jordan grew up in a sports environment.Herself, along with her three sisters, were 
very active and outdoors a lot throughout their childhood in Fayetteville, Georgia.
“I was more of like the tomboy in the fam-
ily that really wanted to be into sports,” Jor-dan said.
But soccer was not her first sport. Before she put on her first pair of cleats 
when she was 12, Jordan was a black belt and junior Olympic champion in taekwondo.
Jordan said she made the transition to soc-
cer because she wanted to be part of a sport 
that she could have more of a collegiate and 
professional future.
Mission accomplished.So how did Jordan go from a brand new 
soccer player at age 12 to getting college of-fers before her freshman year of college? She gives credit to her long time coach and train-er, Mac Williams.
Jordan said coaches had difficulty finding 
a position for her to play in her first year of club soccer.
“I wasn’t good at anything else,” Jordan 
said, “so they just put me in goal.”
Upon realizing that she despised playing 
goalkeeper and wanted to be playing on the field, Jordan switched club teams to the Con-corde Fire, where she met Williams in her 
first season.
Williams said in a phone interview that, 
when Jordan began, she was the least skilled 
player on the team.
But Jordan worked hard and quickly got 
better. 
Williams said she began to elevate past 
her teammates.
Williams said Jordan’s rapid development 
and growth as a player were due to her in-tense drive to be the best player she could be. She was intent on improving herself every day.
“She came, she made the team and, dur-
ing the summer, she said she wanted to train,” Williams said. “I said ‘what days do you want to train?’ and she said Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
Friday, Saturday.”
In the time they trained together, Jordan 
said Williams taught her everything that she 
needed to know to be a great player.
She would never play goalkeeper again.“He basically trained me in everything 
that I knew, started from scratch with noth-ing,” Jordan said. “He basically taught me how to put my cleats on, and from there he 
just built on everything every day and kind 
of got me to where I am.”
The relationship between the two is more 
than a player and a coach. 
Williams said he considers Jordan one of 
his children, and the feeling is mutual.
“He was my trainer and my club coach, 
and now he’s just kind of like my second dad,” Jordan said.
Jordan then played for Concorde through-
out high school, where she quickly devel-oped and only got stronger at the forward position.
It was early in her playing days, however, 
that she was already receiving letters and in-terest from colleges across the country.
In fact, it was the summer before her 
freshman year of high school when Jordan first started hearing from colleges.
Her hometown being Fayetteville, Jordan 
heard from many Southeastern Conference schools early in the recruitment process. She didn’t limit herself to the South, though. Jor-dan said she took trips all over the country in search of the university that fit her best.
“Growing up, I didn’t have a school that 
was a dream school for me to go to or a uni-versity that I knew I really wanted to attend,” Jordan said. “I kind of looked at any school that was really interested in me.”
In her sophomore year of high school, Jor-
dan committed to Auburn University. She soon realized, though, that it wasn’t the right fit for her and, in the summer before her ju-
nior year, she decided to de-commit.That’s when Florida entered the picture.
    
Victor Campbell, the Gators’ associate 
head coach, reached out to Jordan and ex-
pressed Florida’s interest during her early 
years of high school.
Unfortunately for the Gators, Jordan had 
just committed to Auburn, but Campbell 
didn’t give up the pursuit.
“I could see the potential in this kid,” 
Campbell said. “Her best days were still ahead of her.”
Soon after Jordan de-committed from 
Auburn, Campbell got a phone call from Jor-
dan’s club coach saying that she would like 
to take a visit to Florida.
That visit would be the first real interac-
tion between Jordan and the University of Florida.
It would prove to be a good one.“You could just tell on her visit that she 
was more focused, more serious, really goal-oriented in terms of knowing what she want-
ed,” said Florida head coach Becky Burleigh. 
“And that’s different from a lot of kids.”
That visit ended up being all Jordan need-
ed to make her decision on where she would play her college soccer. 
She said she loved the fact that the Florida 
coaches and players created a family atmo-sphere.
 “Once I came down, I ended up meeting 
all the coaches and just kind of fell in love with the school,” Jordan said.
Mac Williams said he received a phone 
call from Jordan shortly after she committed to Florida.
“She told me when she walked in there …
she saw it was a place of champions,” Wil-liams said, “and she said ‘this is where I want to be’.”
    
After a breakout first year in college, Jor-
dan was named an All-American, the Nation-al Rookie of the Year and SEC Offensive Play-er of the Year after starting every game for Florida. She scored an astounding 22 goals, second all-time for a Florida freshman.
Jordan was named to the U.S. U-20 World 
Cup roster this past July after scoring five 
goals in as many matches for the national 
team in January.
Now in her sophomore season with the 
Gators, Savannah Jordan is exactly where she wants to be. She is “beyond glad that it all happened the way it did.”
Jordan said that she owes her success to 
her parents, club coaches and everyone who has helped her along her journey of pursuing 
a successful soccer career, but that she didn’t 
envision such prosperity in such a short amount of time.
“I came in with not that big of expecta-
tions,” Jordan said. “And even now…I still have next goals in mind.” 14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2014

After a freshman season filled with accolades such as SEC Offensive Player of the Year and National Rookie of the Year, Jor -
dan has picked up this season right where she left off. As a sophomore, She leads the Gators with 11 goals and 25 points.
Making it matter: Jordan makes 
smooth transition into soccerparts of the press at this point. 
Though Donovan mentioned the potential for young play-ers to contribute offensively. 
“He’s been good. I mean, 
I think he’ll be fine,” Dono-van said of Chiozza. “I think the biggest thing in the press is he’s really good on the ball but the problem is when he’s off the ball, where you rotate to, when to come up, when to go back, how to read the floor. Those are things he’s going to have to learn and get better at right now.”
Chiozza may not only be 
looked to for full court press but also for defensive leader-ship. 
“For Chiozza, he’s a first 
year just like I was last year,” said sophomore guard Kasey Hill. “On defense for example I didn’t talk a lot last year, and I can see him going through the same thing right now. Helping him in that way I could say I became more vo-cal.”
After three practices so far 
this season, Hill identified a collective weakness that he has battled personally and this year’s team is battling it as a whole. “We don’t talk a lot as 
much as last year,” Hill said. “But I feel like we’re improv-ing on that.”
Hill learned his own lesson 
about being active and both vocally and physically dur-ing what Donovan described as an up and down freshman year. 
“The one thing I was disap-
pointed at him last year, and Kasey knows this because we had discussions about this, I thought a lot of times his ef-fort and his energy was really up and down,” Donovan said. “And he’s such a great kid, and he’s so laid back some-times. It’s not a good disposi-tion as a 6-foot-1 point guard, and I would say that since we’ve practiced, I have not seen any of that.” 
Over the summer, Hill took 
Donovan’s critique to heart and put in the effort. He lost weight and went from 180-185 pounds to 170-175 pounds. Hill said he also focused on learning more about UF’s game. 
“Just learning, learning 
about pick-and-roll, jump shooting, jump shots, 15-footer, stuff like that,” Hill said. “Just getting the offense ready, stuff like that.”Despite playing six fewer sets 
this season, Mallette has more 
kills, more points, a higher hitting 
percentage and nine fewer errors than Santos-Lamb.
“What we tell all our players, 
your job is to keep working hard 
everyday in practice so that when 
your name is called, you can con-tribute in what you do best,” Wise said.
Freshman outside hitter Carli 
Snyder has also seen her playing time dip lately in favor of the more experienced Recek.
But in 12 more sets this season, 
Snyder has played better than Re-cek. The freshman has roughly double the junior’s kills and has a 
higher hitting percentage but has 
also committed 18 more errors.
“Both (Ziva and Gabby) have 
shown of recent that they’re in a 
pretty good offensive zone right 
now, but the decision really had to do a lot with defense as much as offense,” Wise said.
And since circumstances will 
continue to change, Florida’s line-up will too.
Wise has experimented with 
different players in every match this season. In addition to Mallette and Recek, middle blocker Shai-
nah Joseph and setter Abby Deter-
ing have played in certain spots to either shift a set’s momentum, take advantage of an opponent’s 
mismatch or simply to gain expe-
rience.
As the midway point of the sea-
son draws closer, Florida’s bench has shown consistency despite 
fluctuations in its depth chart.“I’m really proud of our team 
and the resiliency they have 
shown,” Wise said. “I think yester-day was a perfect example of both Ziva and Gabby doing that.”month after reaching the semifi-nals at the 2014 Riviera/ITA All-
American Championships.
“I was so proud to see not only 
the quality of tennis, but perhaps 
even more importantly, the way we competed with one another,” 
coach Roland Thornqvist said in 
a release. 
“All five played with such 
class and respect for each other. 
Remember, we do this every day 
in practice, so these girls are used to playing against the best every day.”
No. 14-ranked and No. 3 seed 
junior Brianna Morgan won all four rounds until dropping the title-winning match with Kuhl-man.
No. 7 seed Peggy Porter 
reached the semifinals after de-feating Georgia Tech’s Natasha Prokhnevska, 6-4, 6-4, but then dropped to teammate Morgan, 
6-2, 6-2.
No. 89-ranked and No. 13 seed Belinda Woolcock defeated Geor-gia State’s Linn Timmermann, 
7-6, 6-4.
But before reaching quarterfi-
nals, the sophomore dropped to 
Miami’s Stephanie Wagner, 6-3, 
6-1. 
Australian Stefani Stojic won 
the first round by defeating FSU’s Yukako Noi, 6-2,6-3, but followed 
that with a loss to Miami’s Sinead 
Lohan, 6-3, 6-4. 
Spencer Liang defeated 
Stetson’s Maja Salibasic in Round 
1, 6-3,6-2, but dropped to Silva 
Garcia from the University of Georgia, 6-4, 6-3.
No. 51-ranked and No. 9 seed 
Kourtney Keegan dropped round 
one to Florida State’s Daneika 
Borthwick, 0-6,6-3,6-4.
“The work ethic that these 
eight players have is unparallel, 
even with our national champi-
onship teams,” Thornqvist said. “Their attitudes, their willing-ness to learn and work on things has been fantastic.”

Eight weeks have come and gone 
so far this college football season. With 
just six weeks remaining until the reg-ular season comes to a close, the Heis-man Trophy watch is in full swing. The alligatorSports ballots have been casted, and here are the results thus far.
1.) Dak Prescott, Quarterback, 
Mississippi State: Prescott has done nothing short of excel during his second year as No. 1 Missis-sippi State’s starting signal caller. The junior led the Bulldogs to three straight wins against top 10 South-eastern Conference teams in then-No. 8 LSU, then-No. 6 Texas A&M and then-No. 2 Auburn. Prescott threw for at least 246 yards in all three contests while tossing ﬁ  ve touchdowns to just two intercep-tions. He also gained 303 rushing yards and six touchdowns on the ground during those three games, as well.
2.) Marcus Mariota, Quarter-
back, Oregon: Mariota is on pace to top both his passing yards and passing touchdown totals from 2013, and he is one of just two quar-terbacks with at least 100 pass at-tempts to not throw an interception this season. The junior is also aver-
aging 10.4 yards per pass attempt, 
which is second only to Clemson’s 
Deshaun Watson (10.5).
3.) Amari Cooper, Wide Re-
ceiver, Alabama: Just seven games into the season, Cooper has already set a career-high in receptions (62) and is one of four receivers to have at least 900 receiving yards this season. Outside of a two-catch, 22-yard outing against Arkansas this week on Oct. 11, Cooper has at 
least eight receptions and 91 yards 
in every game. He leads the SEC in receptions per game (8.9), yards 
per game (129.7) and is second in 
receiving touchdowns (seven).4.) Ameer Abdullah, Running 
Back, Nebraska: Abdullah leads 
the Big 10 with 14 rushing touch-
downs while also averaging 146.3 yards per game for the No. 16 
Cornhuskers. The senior has scored 
at least two rushing touchdowns in each of the last four games and recorded a career-high four rushing touchdowns during Wisconsin’s 
38-17 win against Northwestern on 
Saturday.
5.) Melvin Gordon, Running 
back, Wisconsin: Gordon leads the 
nation with 174.33 rushing yards per game — which accounts for 36 percent of the Badgers’ offensive 
production this season. The junior 
tailback is one of four players with at least 1000 rushing yards and is 
the only one to do so in six games, 
and he is averaging just shy of 8 yards per carry on 132 rushes.
