org.West Virginia man sets fire to house after dinner is late
SISSONVILLE, W.Va. — Kanawha County authorities said a 
marital spat over a late dinner has landed a man in jail on an 
arson charge. Lt. Sean Crosier of the Sheriff's Department said 60-year-old Guy Edward Jones came home Sunday and got an-gry because his wife, Beverly Jones, didn't have dinner on the table.
Crosier said the couple fought and Beverly Jones ran to a 
neighbor's house. Crosier said she turned and saw flames coming out of the basement and her husband exiting through the base-ment door.

� THE MURALS WERE PAINTED ON 12
COLUMNS IN THE DOWNTOWN BUS STATION.
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
Twelve columns of the Rosa Parks Downtown Re-
gional Transfer Station were dedicated Tuesday to hon-
or prominent civil rights leaders.
Over the last five weeks, the columns, located at 700 
SE Third St., were painted with vivid murals that depict various landmarks in the struggle for social equality.
Park’s refusal to give up her bus seat, Dr. King’s 
speeches, the March on Washington, the desegregation of schools, and the bus boycott are all represented. The final column features portraits of U.S. Presidents Abra-ham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Barack Obama and Sen. 
Robert Kennedy. 
Massachusetts-based artist Alan Pearsall was com-
missioned by the City of Gainesville Parks, Recreation 
& Cultural Affairs Art in Public Places Trust Advisory Board to create the murals, which wrap around the col-
umns. 
The wraparound design is meant to encourage visi-
tors to walk around and read the accompanying narra-
tives that explain the painted scenes, Pearsall said.
“Accessible to old and young alike, the history can be 
gathered in a creative way by viewing, reading or both,” Pearsall said in a written statement. 
Pearsall could not attend the dedication ceremony as 
he was recently involved in an automobile accident. He is expected to make a full recovery.

It’s fast. It’s exciting. It’s violent.
UF’s rugby team is going to Colum-
bus, Ohio, on June 2 to participate in the first USA Sevens’ Rugby Collegiate Championship Invitational.
Rugby sevens, a rugby style debut-
ing in the 2016 Summer Olympics, mixes football and soccer, said Noah Walker, UF' rugby club's president.
“It’s got a lot of potential to catch 
on with the explosion of violent sports like MMA and football with its deep-seated fanbase already,” Walker said. 
“People like to watch people hit each 
other, outrun each other, so I think it’s got a great chance of really gaining hold at the national level.”
The tournament, 
which will take place  from June 4 to 6, will be broadcast on NBC, NBC 
Universal Sports and Hulu. The event 
is also expected to be a prime oppor-
tunity to scout talent for the national 
rugby sevens team, Walker said.

After a moment of silence, senators unani-
mously passed a resolution during Tuesday’s 
Senate meeting to honor Lamar Abel, a former 
UF football player who died over the week-end.
After the tribute to Abel, senators debated 
over and approved Student Body President Ashton Charles’ nominations for the five jus-tices of the UF Supreme Court.
“They are all really qualified individuals,” 
said  Vice President Marcus Dixon. “They have proven to be leaders in Student Government and around campus.”
Members of the Student Alliance party ques-tioned the qualifications of the five nominees, asking them if they had read any UF Supreme Court cases and the UF constitution.
Chief Justice David Nigliazzo’s appointment 
sparked some debate when it was revealed he had not read the full text of the constitution.  
Student Alliance Senate leader Jonathan Os-sip said his party wanted to be sure the jus-tices were qualified before approving them.  Court justices approved

Richard Gordon Blackey 
was attacked early Wednesday 
morning in his Seminole home 
just west of Pinellas Park by his

Blackey’s girlfriend, 35-year-
old Melissa Howell, sustained a 
small bite on her thumb while 
trying to subdue the dog. 
She called police, who were 
able to trap the dog, Mickey, 
inside the bedroom. Animal services removed the dog from 
the home.

He was trying to make a flight 
out of Ft. Lauderdale to Colombia. 
The bus service offered a “first class coach” trip from Gainesville to Mi-ami for $20. He took the trip; he 
won’t ever do that again.
Alberto Arcieri, a 65-year-old 
retired Gainesville resident, bought 
a GatorBus ticket to Miami for May 14. He had also bought a ticket from the Aires airline.
The bus was supposed to arrive 
in Miami at 8:30 p.m. It didn’t get there until 1:30 a.m., Arcieri said.“Everything from that trip was 
awful,” Arcieri said. “We arrived there at 1:30 in the morning. I had to be at the airport by 2 in the after-
noon, but I felt so sick that I had to 
cancel.”
The bus company responded to 
his complaints of breakdowns and lack of air conditioning with an e-mail saying that mechanical break-downs are common in the transpor-tation business.
The company gave Arcieri a re-
fund for the $20 he spent, but he wanted to be paid back for missing his flight.
Previously, Arcieri’s wife, Marla, and his daughter, Lina, had taken GatorBus to Miami before taking a 
flight to Colombia. When they re-turned to Miami, they found an e-
mail sent two days before the bus was supposed to take them home to Gainesville. The e-mail explained, 
“Due to high demand for private 
bus charters GatorBus will not be providing service for the month of April.”
Buses carrying more than nine 
passengers must register with the Department of Transportation, a department official said. Although the GatorBus website lists its name 
as GatorBus, LLC, no transporta-
tion services were listed as Gator-Bus in the DOT’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration data-base. The GatorBus website said it is a subsidiary of the Empire Coach Lines, which did have a listing in the department’s safety database.
Empire Coach Lines, of Orlando, 
operates 12 buses. 
Nine have been inspected with 
four total violations in the past two years.
The violations ranged from inop-
erative brake systems to a cracked bus frame.
The DOT database recommend-
ed the bus service be inspected.
GatorBus representatives did 
not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Forced to close its doors after 
4 p.m. now, the Fat Tuscan Café 
may have to close forever if its zoning code doesn’t change.
The Italian-American restau-
rant on 725 NE First St., which regularly features live guitar mu-
sic, had its last evening perfor-
mance Friday. Until further no-tice, it will be closed on Sundays and after 4 p.m. every other day due to a noise complaint from a resident.
The original zoning code did 
not allow the café to be open af-ter 4 p.m. Monday through Satur-day or be open on Sundays. But 
around December 2009, owners 
Michelle Reeves and Marianne Toppino started to keep the café open Thursdays, Fridays and Sat-urdays until around 8:30 p.m.
“We needed to bring in some 
more income with the economy 
the way it is,” Reeves said. “[The 
longer hours have] been carrying us through the recession.”
Gainesville Code Enforcement 
officer Todd Martin issued a noise complaint citation after a call from 
a nearby resident May 15 during a night of acoustic music. The café 
had until May 21 to comply with 
its zoning code. 
Neither the resident who 
complained nor Martin could be 
reached for comment.
“Now, we have to go to the 
City Commission and ask them to let us do what we’re already do-
ing,” Reeves said.
Collin McLeod, 24, of 738 NE 
Second St., shares a fence line 
with the Fat Tuscan. He said the restau-
rant’s noise has nev-er bothered him.
“Honestly, Eighth Avenue is 
more annoying with ambulances 
and cop cars than the Fat Tus-
can,” he said.
Elijah George, 27, of 114 NE 
Seventh Ave., who owns a lot adjacent to the café, said he was 
unaware the Fat Tuscan had live 
music on weekends but said noise from  Sky Bar on University Av-enue bothers him.
“I know a lot of people com-
plain about that in the neighbor-hood,” George said. “But they never shut that down.”
The café may not last through 
the summer if it is not able to hold 
evening hours, Reeves said.Restaurant cuts hours, live music due to complaint

Babies can soak up knowledge like sponges even when they 
dream.
Newborns were found to display a basic form of learning dur-
ing sleep, according to a Columbia University study, which was 
published May 17 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences and is the first to show learning during sleep.
Dana Byrd, a UF psychology researcher and co-author of the 
study, and other researchers studied 1- to 2-day-old babies in New 
York City to find out how they learn so much 
from their surroundings while sleeping up to 18 hours per day.
Byrd said the researchers played a tone, fol-
lowed by a gentle air puff to the babies’ eyelids. After about 20 minutes, 24 of the 26 babies squinted when they heard the noise 
alone, without having the puff of air.
It’s possible this research method could help detect children at 
risk for autism, dyslexia and cerebral palsy, which affects motor 
control.

The infamous Deepwater Horizon oil spill is send-
ing an estimated 5,000 barrels of oil into the Gulf of 
Mexico every day. 
Gators for a Sustainable Campus is giving UF stu-
dents the opportunity to help do something about it. 
Today at 11 a.m., the group will be giving students 
free haircuts on the Plaza of the Americas as a part of a hair collection to aid oil spill containment efforts on the coast of Florida. 
“We wanted to be a part of this effort at UF to make 
sure that if oil reaches our shores, we are prepared,” said Chris Cano, a former member of the group who will be participating in the event.
The hair that is cut will be collected and placed 
into nylon oil-containment booms, which are long, snake-like stockings stuffed with absorbent material that may be placed along the shorelines of the Gulf of Mexico.
Though it may seem unconventional, human hair 
is a good material for the booms because it absorbs oil particles. 
The group won’t just be collecting hair, however. It 
is also hoping that donating hair will lead students to 
become more active in the relief effort and the sustain-
ability cause.
The group will place a table next to the barber shop chair where they will ask people to make a phone call 
to President Obama. 
Heading the relief effort is Gators for a Sustainable 
Campus member Melanie Richards, who got the idea 
for hair collection from students at Florida Interna-tional University in Miami. 
Richards also has been working to get local hair 
salons involved. Avante Garde, Downtown Barber Shop and Salon at 716 have committed to donate their customers’ hair, according to the release. 
“This is an easy way for students to get involved 
in the oil relief effort,” she said. “The government and BP are not doing enough to fix this situation, so we are 
taking things into our own hands. If you care, donate 
hair.”
Though collection of hair has been given a new-
found prominence due to the catastrophic Gulf spill, the idea is not exactly new. 
Hair For Oil Spills was a plan originally devised 
nearly a decade ago by California-based nonprofit or-ganization Matter of Trust. Hair clippings to be sent to Gulf

Life Prerequisites
Starting next school 
year, incoming high school freshmen in 
Florida will have to pass both Algebra 1 and Geom-etry in order to earn their diplomas.
We could not be happier 
about the change. It is un-likely that anyone got into college without passing these classes, so the cur-
riculum change only really 
affects the least common denominator in Florida’s schools, and raising the bar 
can only help them.
Not everyone plans 
on going to college after 
graduation, and requiring kids to know how to use 
a protractor probably will 
not make that big of an im-pact on how many choose to pursue higher education, 
but it will make their lives a little bit easier.
Mastering even the most 
basic math concepts can take people a lot farther in life. 
Without an understanding of math, everything from building a bookshelf to 
balancing a checkbook can 
seem out of reach.
Knowing algebra will 
not change your mechanic into an engineer, and learn-
ing geometry probably can 
not make your drywall guy an architect, but it will make them better at their jobs.
It might turn out that 
the only benefit of the new standard is that your sandwich artist at Subway knows how many degrees 
are in a cheese triangle, but 
that would not be the worst thing in the world.

Remember the purpose 
of Memorial Day
The weather is going to be great, but you may want to 
think twice before cracking open a beer and having a pool party this weekend. 
Monday is Memorial Day, and we encourage everybody 
to take the time to honor the people who died for our coun-try, not the least among them Lance Cpl. Philip Paul Clark, an Alachua County native and 2008 Buchholz High School graduate who died on May 18 while serving in Afghani-stan.
Clark’s body is going to be escorted into town today by 
the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office, and his funeral service will be held at Queen of Peace Catholic Community on Fri-day at 9:30 a.m.
While Clark’s sacrifice is especially meaningful, mil-
lions of Americans have died fighting for their country since they day it was founded. It might be a good time to remember that by visiting memorial displays at Kanapaha Park on Tower Road or the Veterans for Peace’s tombstones on Northwest Eighth Avenue and 34th Street. It might not go down as your happiest Sunday afternoon, but our fallen soldiers deserve to be remembered.
This is not the time to talk about whether we should be 
in the two wars we are fighting. It is not the time to curse politicians, and it certainly is not the time to protest. There are another 364 days in the year for that. It is the time to think about Philip Paul Clark and the other soldiers who gave up their lives so we could live ours.
Come Monday we should all take a break from our opin-
ions and remember that people have died fighting for us not because they had to but because they chose to.
I love a good Internet political meme. Most political 
junkies have their inner circles of friends on  an  email list-serve that they use to distribute particularly funny 
or applicable memes. It can be a very enjoyable hobby.  
For those shaky on the definition, a meme is a concept that is spread via the Internet, text message or other digital me-dia. In most cases, the concept is novel, or a novel refor-mulation of an existing concept, that is quickly and easily 
spread from person to person. My senior thesis was about 
how the Internet has transformed the political process.
To me, it is a fascinating subject. The Internet provides 
a widely accessible and easy-to-use launching platform for 
the citizen politician. Though it is a relatively new addition 
to the American lifestyle, it can often be taken for granted. 
     One of the greatest assets of the Internet in the applica-
tion of politics is the ability for the citizen to launch effec-tive political statements (through memes, blogs, thought 
pieces, etc) without censorship. That is true freedom of 
speech — something that may have been missing in other 
news media. TV and radio information dissemination is 
still restricted to what the producers and executives of the respective media outlets choose to air, and few people 
have the resources to operate their own TV and radio sta-
tions. 
The Internet, however, is truly the citizen politico’s 
great weapon in making a wide-reaching and lasting im-pression in the political arena.
Consider how easily Internet memes have reached you 
in the 2008 election. Who didn’t hear about America’s most famous Internet meme political celebrity, Joe the Plumber? Or who hasn’t seen the iconic stylized red and blue Obama “Hope” poster? Both were the result of suc-
cessfully launched Internet memes.
I believe this is a reason for the modern American po-
litical junkie to feel lucky. But, it’s not all roses with the Internet. The citizen must be able to 
use the Internet for valid political information without falling prey to soundbites and trolls.
The soundbite is a popular tool used by some to dis-
tort the message of a politician or meaning of legislation. It is used by both sides to simplify an argument or tint a quote or speech. The Internet can expose or promulgate 
the soundbite – the savvy Internet politico has determined 
how to differentiate the two.
The Internet has also given a home to the country’s 
political trolls. These are the people who wish to be in 
the political arena but have no solid arguments of their 
own. Thus, they turn to petty personal attacks in online 
chat forums and comment sections for attention. Freedom 
of speech should always be protected, and trolls have the right to troll, but the modern online politico knows to take 
these fire-starters with more than a grain of salt.
The Internet is such an amazing tool and can be so 
widely applicable in politics. According to the Pew In-
stitute for American study, 46 percent of Americans had used the Internet to participate in the American presiden-
tial campaign by June of 2008. This is an inspiring figure 
for those of us who wish to see voter turnout increase.
There is still much potential in its application as a tool 
for the people to communicate with governing bodies, and vice versa. I wish more national bills were posted online 
for longer periods of time — this would be a great way to 
expose pork barrel spending to otherwise oblivious con-stituents. It might also be good practice to have the federal government employ the online national debt tracker as a screen saver. It may help our current administration curb 
some of its overwhelming spending tendencies.

Resident disagrees with State Attorney’s 
decision regarding student shooting.
Gainesville residents who walk with canes 
are advised not to lift them above their waist 
in the presence of law officers. Doing so may result in you being legally shot, or so argues Bill Cervone in his statement regarding Kofi Adu-
Brempong.
His inability to see Keith Smith’s actions as 
brutal and excessively violent are indicative of 
his ineptitude as a State Attorney. I urge all in the community to not ‘put [this] issue to rest,’ but to seek alternatives to Bill Cervone’s illogi-cal conclusions about the matter. Join the Jus-tice for Kofi Adu-Brempong Facebook group to find out about ways you can help curb police 
brutality, bring justice to a victim, and change 
the culture of the Eighth Judicial Circuit.  
Goals include an Independent Police Review Board, the improvement of mental health and crisis services, and a Grand Jury investigation of the incident.

for sexual health.
After seeing the column ‘Sexual health care 
on the cheap’ in the May 13th edition of the Al-
ligator, we’d like to remind readers that the UF Student Health Care Center also offers a full range of sexual health care services available to 
students. 
UF students pay a health fee in their tuition 
that helps supports the SHCC. Visits to a prima-
ry care provider, and most of the practitioners in the women’s clinic, do not require additional payment. Patients won’t have to endure a long wait if they call first (352-392-1161) to make an appointment. Often, students can get an ap-pointment the same day they call! 
SHCC provides testing for sexually trans-
mitted infections and results are always confi-dential – not even parents can see the results, unless patients give written permission.
 For the comfort of our patients, all staff at 
our women’s clinic are female. Students can get prescriptions for birth control or other medica-tions filled at our pharmacy on-site. Some of these medications are offered at discount prices 
for students. Tests and medications do require 
payment, but the SHCC tries to keep prices at or below community rates.
Another big bonus of using the Student 
Health Care Center is that students are as-signed to a team of health care providers and will see these same doctors and nurses through-out their time at UF. Wouldn’t you like to know the person helping you manage your health, instead of wondering who you’re going to see 
and whether he or she will understand your in-
dividual needs? And SHCC is located right on campus – our main location is on Fletcher Drive near the Hub and football stadium. You can fit an appointment in between classes.

Friends of Lamar Abel share memories.
Dear Lamar,Words cannot describe my feelings 
for you, but words are all I seem to have.  
Just because I cannot see and speak to you physically, you are more around me than ever 
before. 
“Everybody Ain’t Abel.” You had your 
own phrase that people actually used. Who 
does that?!? I used to call myself the CEO of Lamar Enterprises. You would correct me and say that title belonged to you and I could be an assistant. Well, I must say you did well for yourself and received excellent reviews:
“A good friend is someone who still has 
your back in a bad situation knowing that you were wrong. He always defended his friends even though he knew of their flaws like drink-ing and driving, but he always made sure ev-eryone made it safe after a road trip.”  —Elwor-thy Williams, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.
“His time was cut short because his job was 
well done on earth. I’m thankful I got a chance to know him.” — Carlos Dunlap, Cincinnati 
Bengals Defensive End
“Growing up with Lamar was like watching 
a future star.” — Adriana Crawford, Cousin
“He was a man of his word.” — Corey Hen-
derson, UF football player
“He had a vibe where you can tell him any-
thing.” — Chantel Johnson, UF junior
“In one word, I would describe him as 
humble.” — Woudlin Jean-Baptiste, UF engi-neering major
“Even if he was mad, he used his tone in-
stead of physical force because he knew he 
could do bodily harm.” — Earv Johnson, Ome-ga Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.
“He was very detail oriented. He always 
wanted to do his best in every organization, because it would reflect on him.” — Dr. Mi-chael Bowie, College of Education director of 
recruitment, retention and multicultural af-
fairs.
Wow! Who would have guessed that fun-
ny saying created freshman year would be so true. Everybody really ain’t Abel.
We love you. Get some rest, friend.

As a corporation, British Pe-
troleum is deeply saddened by the recent leaks in our in-
terwebs tube that have pumped out an ever-increasing number of highly 
sensitive and damaging internal docu-
ments into the vital Gulf of Public Opinion.  We have prepared the fol-lowing memo as a “top kill procedure” on the destructive flow of information by piping loads of crap into real leaks of BP’s corporate philosophy:
BP has been heartened by the way 
our CEO, Tony Hayward, was able 
to use his charming British accent to 
make even the most odious proclama-tions and reversals seem somewhat palatable to a generation of Americans who will be irreparably harmed by our recent public relations disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.  Keeping in line with this logic, BP is pleased to announce that our new spokesperson will be the 
Geico gecko.
Hiring the gecko, and thereby 
gleaning at least some measure of his 
genteel persona, will also head off any charges that BP somehow harbors little concern for the welfare of animals. In fact, this year British Petroleum has al-ready committed more money toward helping animals dying from contact 
with oil and chemical dispersants than 
any other corporation or government in the world. 
Why? Because we care.BP may care more for these help-
less and gentle creatures than the boot-wearing naysayers in the Ameri-can political system. President Obama and the Democrats are facing a tough 
campaign this fall for control of Con-
gress and are likely to back away from publicly supporting intensely com-munal animals like waterfowl, due to rising public resentment for the word “socialist.”   
Sea turtles skew older and conser-
vative, with their rock-solid breed-ing schedules, and thus may not be a key Obama con-stituency go-ing forward.  While the wel-fare of fish and 
fisherman is 
of the utmost 
concern to BP, the cutthroat life of a fish mirrors our own corporate cul-ture and the wider capitalist system enough that our company feels it nec-essary to ask a simple question of the American people.
What is the most important natural 
resource in the world?
While some may argue passion-
ately that the health of the natural eco-systems and nature itself is of utmost concern and others may advocate for various non-renewable resources like oil, British Petroleum posits that the most vital natural resource in the world is the healthy corporation vig-
orously swimming in an unfettered 
ocean of free market capitalism.
The recent exemplary record our 
company has had in job creation in the besieged Gulf region should be cel-ebrated rather than vilified, especially as we still have access to the valuable oil well itself.  The true test of our new gecko spokesman will be his ability to 
use a somber tone and elicit sympathy 
when we give American taxpayers the bill for removing all the dead animals from our oil.
 Like the majestic dolphin, a corpo-
ration is a bellwether species that sig-nals the overall health and vitality of a system. While the outright destruction of the coastline of much of America is 
certainly regrettable, we cannot sit idly 
by and let a huge global corporation like BP simply die in the muck like so many millions of living creatures.

PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, 
Colo. —On the eve of a vote to end 
the military ban on openly gay ser-vice members, the nation’s top uni-formed military officer repeated his 
support Wednesday for repealing 
the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.
“Personal opinion? I believe it’s 
time. I believe we need to change it,” Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told about 500 service members at Peterson Air Force Base. However, Mullen stressed that the change had not yet 
been approved. And if it is, he said 
he wouldn’t make any final deter-minations on how to implement it until the military studies the issue and gets input from troops.
The Senate Armed Services Committee plans to vote Thursday on overturning the ban. The pro-posal would overturn the ban but allow the military to decide when and how to  make any changes.
Mullen talked about the likely 
repeal in a question-and-answer session with the troops. His visit 
sparked a response from GOP Rep. 
Doug Lamborn, who represents the area. Lamborn told reporters 
a repeal of the ban should not even be considered un-til the military has 
completed its study.
Mullen also addressed 1,001 
graduating cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy. He urged the new officers to have the “strength of character” to support whatever de-cision is made.Military chief calls

“Many of the players playing on the weekend

The UF squad, as well as the other 15 teams in 
the tournament, were chosen because they are ex-
pected to attract a large audience, said Jim Hinkin, 
competitions manager for USA Sevens.
“Rugby is closely related to football,” he said. 
“We wanted rivalry schools from good football 
traditions. That’s why we have Florida and Ten-
nessee.”UF's team ended the year ranked 15th by Amer-
ican Rugby News with a 17-2 record. A three-point loss to Tennessee, who is in the same tournament bracket as Florida, kept UF out of the Sweet 16. 
The teams will meet on June 5.

Walker said. “We don’t want to look like fools on

USA Sevens is paying for transportation, food,

  Want to learn how to grow weeds? Have 
you been itching to use your green thumb this 
summer? Then I’m here to tell you that it’s not only easy, it’s fun and affordable.
  After a lengthy sojourn to a couple local 
garden centers, I came to the blistering real-ization, thanks to a Master Gardener at the UF/IFAS Alachua County Extension Ofﬁ  ce, that this particular type of sowing endeavor is not as difﬁ  cult as one would imagine.
�   Step 1: Finding a place for your garden
  All of the shrubbery mentioned herein can 
be conveniently planted in an affordable gar-dening container. 
  The sun is (obviously) a primary fac-
tor when gardening, so you need to decide where to plant ﬁ  rst. If you have a south-facing balcony, you will most likely have the best ex-posure.
  For those of you who are living in dorms, 
you may only have access to a window. A house plant is probably your best option.
�   Step 2: Choosing the right soil type
  Most plants prefer neutral to slightly acid-
ic soil that is well drained. Professional soil mixes found at garden centers should work ﬁ  ne.
� Step 3: Picking which plants you want 
to grow
  Don’t get complicated. Ask a gardener 
what works best. Some varieties:
  Annuals complete their life cycle in one year 
and are generally used for color. Impatiens, petunias and pansies are a few examples.Perennials ﬂ  ower every year and are pri-marily used to add color to a space. Butterﬂ  y plants, you guessed it, attract but-terﬂ  ies. Milkweed, pentas and salvias are 
only a few of the varieties you can plant. If 
you’re looking to witness the entire circle of life, the passion vine attracts caterpillars. Edible plants include herbs such as ba-sil, parsley and cilantro. Herbs are easy to grow and can be added to any meal – even your Ramen noodles. Another va-riety of edible plants are vegetables such as tomatoes, eggplant and peppers.
If you’re lazy, house plants are the way to go. 
They’re easy to grow and maintain.
�   Step 4: Buying your plant supplies
  Talk to some experts. Garden Gate Nurs-
ery, located off of Northwest 43rd Street and Harmony Gardens, located off of Northwest 13th Street, are among the garden centers in Gainesville.
  If you have extra cash and are feeling a 
little more adventurous, there’s a hydropon-ics store in town called the Gardener’s Edge, 
located off of Northwest Eighth Avenue.

“There’s a man behind the 
mustache. I’ve started telling people (on the street), ‘Listen, my eyes are up here.’”
MATT EVERHART
mustache wearerFacial hair fad  hits Gainesville’s guys
  By KATHERINE BEIN

  Hey man, what are you wear-
ing on your face this season?
If you’ve been keeping up with facial hair 
fashion trends, you know we’ve been chin-deep in lumberjack scrufﬂ  e. But this season, the ironic beard is usurped by the even-more ironic mustache.I ﬁ  rst discovered the mustache thing when I was in Chicago last Au-gust. Every time I saw a bike ride by, I had handlebar double-vision.
I thought at ﬁ  rst it was just a regional 
variant, but now I know the mustaches have trickled down to the Dirty South.
  Whether it’s thin like a pencil, curved 
like Dali’s or creepy like a sex offender’s, Gainesville’s fashion-forward faces are increasingly graced with sweet ‘staches.
  Take for instance Raul Prado, 23, who 
was recently a model during Gainesville 
Fashion Week. 
  Prado said he’d always stayed baby-
smooth until fashion week ofﬁ  cials di-
rected him to stop. When they gave him raving responses over his new “epic mus-tache,” he decided he would keep it.
  “Two of my coworkers have started 
growing them now,” Prado said, recogniz-ing his trend-setter position.
  Matt Everhart, 24, has worn his mus-
tache for eight months and loves it, but admits his little friend’s popularity is sometimes overshadowing.
  “There’s a man behind the mus-
tache,” he said. “I’ve started telling peo-ple (on the street), ‘Listen, my eyes are up here.’”
  Although some men might feel bur-
dened by the attention a mustache com-mands, others, like Alex Orlando, are thrilled to show it off.
  “I can’t live without this thing,” Or-
lando said. It’s my best friend.” He un-derstands the power a ‘stache can yield. After all, his girlfriend, Erin Rauch, places it high on her list of endearing qualities.
  “It’s fun to kiss. It tickles,” Rauch 
said. “It’s not a burden. It’s a nice little 
addition. I mean, if he gets rid of it we’re breaking up.”
  Of course, every fashion movement 
has its critics at ﬁ  rst, like 22-year-old 
Ashley Harvin.
  “I think they make guys look like ‘70s 
porn stars,” she said. “It’s gross.”
  It’s negativity like this that made Joel 
Kienitz, also known around town as DJ JeRK, shave his experimental lip-acces-sory after only two weeks.
  “A lot of people liked it, but I was get-
ting a lot of weird looks from girls,” Kien-itz said. “I thought it was awesome, but it was too tough for me on the fashion frontlines.”
  Although haters are going to hate no 
matter what, the reality is that there’s no stopping a trend in motion. 
  Even Google knows the whisker-wind 
is changing direction. Carefully study-ing Google trends’ term-tracking tool, a steady increase in searches for “mus-taches” started mid-2009 and continues strong into this summer.
  So, whether you love them or hate 
them, prepare yourselves for the mus-tache madness that is heading our way. 
  “I think they’re an inspiring tradition, 
the symbol of a civilized and progressive man,” said mustache enthusiast Loic Robertson. “If I could grow one, I would.” (From left to right, clockwise) P.J. Zurich , 32, head of security, Spannk. “I wanna get the Civil War , 
with the burns that get big at the mouth and skinny at the top.” Matt Everhart, 24, Ignition Enter-
tainment. Ernie Quincosa , 22, DJ. “It makes me feel like a grown-up for once.” Kyle Lokuta , 24, 
store manager of American Apparel.  David Byron , 22, UF law student. Raul Prado , 23, devel-
oping engineer. “I go to Midtown and all the frat boys are like ‘love the stache, it’ s so manly.”Gardening

Home brewing, a  complicated but rewarding endeavor
  By RICHARD STEHLI
 avenue writer
 
  With all sorts of extra time on 
your hands during Gainesville’s off-
season and a serious prerogative to 
stay indoors, why not try your hand 
at some new hobbies? How about making your own alcohol? Part 
chemistry, part cooking, part art and part drinking, home brewing is a 
great way to pass those extra hours of summer daylight.
  My passion for brewing started 
with winemaking last summer. Since then, carrots, strawberries, apples, blueberries and honey  are 
only some of the ingredients to fall 
prey to my hobby. Regrettably, wine 
must age before drinking it, and al-
though I have several dozen bottles of homemade booze in my kitchen 
cabinet, I’m still playing the waiting game. Bowing to my impatience, I turned to beer, which can be ready 
to drink in as little as a month.
  First, let me dispel any miscon-
ceptions you may have: Brewing is as easy as following instructions. 
Add certain ingredients to a big pot 
at the appropriate time and then 
transfer to different containers ac-
cording to a schedule. A few weeks 
later, you call your friends and drink 
the beer. If you can do that, you can brew.
  The ﬁ  rst step in making delicious 
homemade alcohol is buying a brew kit. Although it’s possible to brew us-ing no specialized equipment, you should learn to rely on skill, tools 
and measurement rather than luck. Hoggetowne Ale Works is Gaines-
ville’s only brewing supply store, and  it has everything you need to 
get started. Brewing kits start at just $69, a very student-friendly price. 
And if you take care of it, the equip-ment will last forever.  Case in point: 
I use my dad’s kit he purchased more than 30 years ago.
  Once you have your kit, the ingre-
dients to make a batch of beer – ﬁ  ve 
gallons – will cost between $25 and $50. It sounds like a lot, but beyond 
your start-up costs that’s well under $1 per 12-ounce beer, and unless you make some very poor decisions 
your beer will taste a lot better than 
the cheap stuff you might ﬁ  nd in a 
keg.
  For your ﬁ  rst recipe you’ll use 
malt extract and fermentable sug-ars already removed from the grain. 
Think of it as buying a can of corn instead of chopping the kernels off a 
cob – it saves a lot of time and gets you consistent results. 
Once you’re comfortable with the 
general process and familiar with 
the nuances of your equipment, you 
can integrate actual grains and oth-er ingredients into your recipes. This 
makes brewing more difﬁ  cult but al-lows for unlimited creativity and cus-
tomization.
  Along with brewing kits, Hog-
getowne Ale Works offers hops, 
grains, recipes, specialty ingredi-ents, winemaking supplies and, 
most importantly, expert advice. Ev-eryone who works at Hoggetown is a brewer and works hard to make your 
life easier, offering consultation and troubleshooting through every stage 
of your brewing projects.
  “Customer service is our biggest 
thing,” says Chris Cook, one of Hog-getowne’s brewing advisers. “We re-ally want you to make good beer.”
  Still not convinced? Stop by Hog-
getown Ale Works, 3454 W Univer-
sity Ave., or call 352-367-4455 for 
more information.

make about 50 12-ounce beers.
� EVENT WAS HELD IN KANAPAHA 
BOTANICAL GARDENS. 
By ALEX ORLANDO
avenue writer  
Electric hums echoed down gravel paths, 
through trees and over creeks as a crowd 
meandered its way through the woods of southwest Gainesville on a steamy Saturday afternoon.
They congregated under bamboo shoots 
and sat among monkey grass to watch An-drew Chadwick as he hooked up his typewrit-er to  a contact microphone and began typ-ing, the percussive sounds of the punching keys amplified by a nearby boom box. 
In his right hand was a children’s accor -
dion, which he used to complement the type -
writer’s chatter, both sounds being pumped 
through the Kanapaha Botanical Gardens 
by his speaker in a scene that recalled Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters.
Chadwick was the first of about 10 per -
formers stationed throughout the gardens as part of the Droney Woods Sound Tour, an audio tour of the gardens featuring synth pop and experimental electronic musicians from around Gainesville.
“I love nature and doing electronic music,” 
said Christopher Miller, 41, who organized the tour. “There is a juxtaposition of sorts. It’s two things that shouldn’t be together.” Miller said the tour was the first of its kind 
in Gainesville and was modeled after a simi-
lar tour on the banks of the Santa Fe River in Worthington Springs, organized by Loren Knack. 
Miller was able to organize the tour with 
the help of his uncle, Don Goodman, the founder and director of Kanapaha Botanical Gardens. As he wiped sweat from his fore -
head after the tour, he said he planned to 
do another in the fall when the weather gets 
cooler.
Knack, who performed under the name 
“Ironing” on Saturday, set up five tape re -
corders in a ring around the 52 attendees who sat in the filtered sunlight under an oak tree. Each recorder played a different sound: static, accordion, chirping frogs or clicking sounds. Some sat admiring the scenery; oth-
ers sat with their eyes closed.
“I think that [the sounds] the musicians bring are not of nature, but they complement 
it,” he said. “It kind of helps people focus on what’s around them.”
Paul Pino, a 21-year-old art student at 
UF, played a series of notes in the pitch of B flat from his MacBook for his performance. A pitch, he said, that is present in nature.
“Alligators go crazy around B flat,” he said, 
also noting scientific studies that have found pitches of B flat resonating from black holes.
Pino timed his song to the beat of a bam-
boo fountain in the garden, which was de -
signed to scare away deer with a loud thump every 30 seconds when it had filled with wa-ter. He said he chose to perform in the area next to the fountain because he wanted his 
environment to be a part of his music.
“It was definitely a way of interacting with 
your environment,” he said. “No one could 
overpower the sound of the environment.”
Other musicians played their music 
through Honeytone portable amplifiers, which were just loud enough to break through the midday buzzing of cicadas. Chadwick, who performed with his typewriter, said he pre-
ferred playing outdoors to indoor venues.
“It’s better than bar chatter,” he said.THURSDAY, MAY 27, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 11

A guide on how to recognize jerks when you see them   
Dear readers, I have enjoyed 
my time so far serving as an 
Avenue columnist. By which, 
I mean that I enjoy getting my opin-
ions and musings out there so I can 
entertain some bored students who 
just finished the crossword in the clas-
sifieds section. However, I will be tak -
ing my column in a different direction 
this time. Instead of entertaining you 
people with (mostly) true stories about 
being bored and anti-social, I will use 
my position as a semi-legitimate col-
umn writer to warn one and all about a 
very grave threat to our collective well-
being: douchebags.
I’m not talking douchebaggery of 
the “Jersey Shore” variety, but true, seething douchebagitude. The sort practiced by insecure people when 
they find themselves so lacking in 
self-value they need to do their best to suck everyone else into their vortex of 
failure. The sort of tool that would see 
someone else and think, “Hey, is that 
guy happy? How can I ruin that?” This 
can also be referred to as “hating.”
Douchebags are ever-resourceful. 
They can ruin things you thought couldn’t get any worse. 
“Hey [douchey nickname that no 
one has ever called you by], sorry 
to hear about that bad breakup you 
just had. Don’t worry though, your ex sucked. I know this because I hooked 
up with [him/her] multiple times. Also, [terribly inap-
propriate com-
ment made in 
public about something pri-
vate].”
They can 
ruin things 
yet to come into being: 
“Hey, have you 
been dating that [girl/guy]? Be careful, [she/he] [phrase describing promiscu -
ous behavior that I engage in myself but isn’t that bad when I do it because 
I’m a douchebag/douchebaguette]. I would know because I know [some -
thing a douchebag/douchebaguette like me should have no business knowing or repeating].”
Recently, a certain douchebag, well 
versed in the techniques described above, took douchebaggery to a new 
level. 
This jerk was ruining the good times 
an ex-girlfriend of mine was having 
and used the fact that I wrote stand-up jokes about her to make her feel bad. 
This led to a hullabaloo (which is an 
awesome word, and I encourage you 
all to use it in everyday conversation), 
which caused a days-long headache 
for your intrepid columnist.
While I can’t really criticize this tool 
for making my ex-girlfriend feel bad (since I managed to do that so much more effectively during our relation-
ship), his most despicable action was 
to use my jokes for evil. This is an egre -
gious violation of Joke Law, and as 
judge, jury and joke executioner, I find 
this douchebag to be guilty. 
The sentence? Being the butt of a 
joke for a whole column while everyone 
who knows him reads it and nods.
Douchebags are an unfortunate 
drawback to knowing people. How -
ever, they do have a positive function: 
They give the rest of us a common 
enemy. Besides, we can all help each 
other overcome this threat through 
mutual support and understanding. Everyone, repeat after me: “Haters 
gonna hate.”

Festival tips from Fest organizer and 
No Idea publicist Tony Weinbender
  Festival veteran Tony Weinbender, 34, has 
been going to music festivals for almost 20 years 
and running them for about 15, so the Avenue asked him for advice on how to do your summer music experience right. 
  If you’re going to plan around parties, Wein-
bender says the ﬁ  rst night and the last night “ev-erybody goes big.” 
  When it comes to food, Weinbender suggests 
raw almonds as a high-energy, high-protein snack. But make sure not to get the roasted or salted kind because that will just make you dehydrated. 
  It’s also a good idea to avoid eating anything 
scary. When stuck with a portable toilet, “you 
don’t want to be having to blow up a bathroom,” 
he said. 
  And though you may love them, don’t bring 
your dogs or other animals. “They don’t like music. They’re just bummed out,” Weinbender said. 
  Then it just comes down to good old common 
sense. And the Internet. Look for stuff you’re go-ing to enjoy, and plan ahead to avoid any major surprises.

 Vinyl records see resurgence, boost in retail sales  
  By ALI RIECH
 avenue writer 
 
  While a penchant for minimalism and 
convenient digital technology drives the 
majority of music sales (or lack thereof), a growing number of music fans are returning 
to a bulkier but more interactive format – 
the vinyl record. 
  Lily Darnell became interested in collect-
ing records after ﬁ  nding a cardboard box 
stuffed with ‘70s-era folk-rock in her par-
ents’ garage. 
  “I feel like MP3s made me lose out on 
any sort of physical interaction with the mu-sic I was listening to. I decided to get into 
records so I could get back to really hearing 
music,” Darnell said. 
  Darnell is not alone, either. 
According to the Recording Industry As-
sociation of America, records are the only 
physical music format to experience any growth in sales. From 2007 to 2008, vinyl 
LP and EP sales rose by 124 percent – a 
ﬁ  gure which, though signiﬁ  cant, may be modest since it doesn’t account for used or independent record sales. Digital sales rose by only 30 percent.  
  The boom in record sales is showing lo-
cally as well. Hear Again Music & Movies owner Andrew Schaer saw a growth in re-cord sales over the past four months. 
Schaer formerly expected about equal 
sales in movies and music, but thanks to the vinyl-revival, records now outsell both CDs and DVDs. 
  “People have been growing up listening 
to mp3s for the past 10 or 15 years – when they hear the uncompressed [vinyl] format it’s an eye-opener. People feel ripped off by 
the compressed version of their favorite al-
bums,” Schaer said. 
  Vinyl collectors tend to describe the 
sound of records as opposed to digital for-mats as richer, warmer and fuller. Analog 
records produce a wider range of frequen-
cies that CDs and mp3s cannot reproduce. Digital-music proponents tend to dismiss this claim by saying the frequencies are 
inaudible. However, some suggest that the 
frequencies are felt rather than heard.
  “Records have a more omni-dimensional 
sound that really ﬁ  lls the room a lot better. LPs sound warmer, and you are more likely 
to notice subtle sounds and instruments,” 
Schaer said.
  Another appealing aspect of the vinyl 
sound is referred to as surface noise – the 
hum of the needle along the record grooves 
and the occasional crackling sound un-heard-of in the comparatively sterile digital format.
  “It’s sort of a warm, fuzzy sound. I love 
it,” Darnell said.
  Because turntables are notoriously dif-
ﬁ  cult to operate while driving, digital music remains popular due, at least in part, to its 
portability. Labels like Sub Pop now include 
digital download with most vinyl record sales.
  iTunes tried to join the analog-trend 
by promoting “iTunes LPs,” which bundle 
artwork, lyrics and videos with full album 
downloads instead of its typical single mp3 downloads. This particular digital LP pro-motion failed to generate any noteworthy 
trend, however.
  The introduction of mp3 technology 
spelled the end of the CD around 2001. De-
clining CD sales pushed a recording indus-try response to thwart a beast that proved 
unstoppable – online music sharing.
  “What’s also great about vinyl is that 
people are ﬁ  nally contributing to the art-
ists they love again and supporting local stores,” Schaer said. 
“If you want to hear an album the way it’s 
meant to be heard, listen to it on vinyl.”

UF TENNIS I DID NOT KNOW THAT TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETTHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF pitcher Brian Johnson allowed seven earned runs in 3.2 innings during the Gators’ 10-6 loss to LSU in the opening round of 
the SEC Baseball Tournament in Hoover, Ala., Wednesday night.
� UF WILL FACE NO. 15 ARKANSAS IN 
AN ELIMINATION GAME TODAY.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
HOOVER, Ala. – The pie has soured for Brian 
Johnson. 
About three weeks after receiving the tradi-
tional cream-filled dessert to the face in celebration 
of a dominating effort against LSU (37-20), the UF 
pitcher lasted just 3.2 horrific innings in Wednes-day’s rematch. 
Johnson, who hit a grand slam and allowed two 
earned runs in 6.1 frames on May 2, was pulled after surrendering seven runs on nine hits as No. 4 Florida (40-14) fell to LSU 10-6 in the opening round of the SEC Tournament in Regions Park Sta-dium.
UF will play an elimination game against No. 15 
Arkansas (40-17) today 30 minutes after the match-up between Auburn and South Carolina.
“(The Tigers) swung the bat real well,” Johnson 
said. “They were aggressive. I just fell behind a little bit and didn’t have my stuff.”
Johnson’s outing went south in the second when 
LSU designated hitter Matt Gaudet hit a lead-off homer. The next five LSU batters reached base, in-cluding an RBI single by No. 9 hitter Mason Katz.
Johnson struggled with his command, walking 
three in the inning, but UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan UF’s Johnson 
falters in 10-6 
loss to LSU

She was up 5-4 over Mallory Bur-
dette, and needed only one more game to make her team the new na-tional champions.
The third set ended 7-5, with 
Boonstra on the losing end.
“My heart just aches for Marrit 
(Boonstra),” UF coach Roland Thorn-qvist said. “She has given this pro-gram everything she has. It’s just not 
fair for it to come down to a result 
like this for her.”
The Cardinal won five of six first

When the Gators softball team takes the 
field Saturday it will be playing not only for 
itself, but also for the future of its program 
and the reputation of the Southeastern Con-ference. 
In this weekend’s NCAA Super Regional 
matchup between No. 4 Florida (46-8) and 
No. 13 Arizona State (44-15), which begins 
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in Gainesville, a trip to the Women’s College World Series, con-ference bragging rights and a legacy of sus-
tained greatness will all be on the line. 
But even with all that to be played for, 
UF coach Tim Walton is energized about 
achieving a different goal. 
“I’m excited about where we’re able to go and I know everybody in the media thinks we’re bound for the World Series and we’re 
probably looking to win a national champi-
onship, but we’re not,” Walton said. “We’re just looking to have fun and go out and take 
care of business the next game. There’s no pressure 
on us, we don’t feel the 
same expectations that ev-
erybody else does. We’re just excited to win.”
Although Walton and 
the team are focused on having fun and taking 
things one game at a time, they still realize how important this weekend and the last 
were to the Florida softball program.

HOOVER, Ala. – The Gators faced a 
brand new opponent Wednesday – the 
clock.
No. 4 Florida (40-14) saw its first-round 
opponent LSU (37-20) less than a month ago, but it had never been exposed to the new pitch clock that is being experimented with in this week’s Southeastern Confer-ence Tournament.
It has been implemented in an attempt 
to speed things up, and it did. 
In last year’s conference tourney, games 
lasted an average of 3 hours and 20 min-utes. Two of the first three contests in this season’s tournament finished in less than 2 hours and 40 minutes. 
The Gators’ game was the longest of the 
first three at 3 hours and 17 minutes due in part to the combined 30 hits the teams racked up.
The new clock was not expected to im-
pact the Gators, who preach a quick and consistent rhythm on the mound.
“It didn’t affect me at all,” UF starting 
pitcher Brian Johnson said. “I work at a fast pace anyway.”
However, the freshman hurler struggled 
as he allowed nine hits in just 3.2 innings while giving up seven runs.
The new rules that come along with the clock include a 20-second timer for the pitcher. When the bases are empty, hurlers have 20 seconds to deliver each pitch. The batter is rewarded with an added ball to the count if the pitcher fails to throw before the clock expires.
UF’s game went without an incident as 
each pitcher worked efficiently.
In order to help give the players a better 
idea of the allotted time, they have added a digitalized clock in right-center field that counts down the seconds.
A fourth umpire that is not on the field 
controls the new timer.
Another strategy the SEC is using to 
make things go by faster is shortening the gap in be-tween frames. 
There will be just 108 
seconds from when the last out is made and the first pitch of each half inning is 
thrown.
Despite all of the added regulations to 
control the pace of the game, coach Kevin O’Sullivan did not want to burden his play-ers with adjustments.
“We kept it simple,” O’Sullivan said. 
“If the catcher makes the last out, we make 
sure we have the back up (catcher) in there 
(to catch warm-up pitches).”
If these new policies go over smoothly 
this week, they could become part of con-
ference play in the regular season too.SEC enforces pitch clockNATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE

Jarvis Williams, a former defen-
sive back for the Miami Dolphins and 
New York Giants, died Tuesday night 
in north Florida. He was 45.
A spokeswoman with the Putnam 
Community Medical Center said Wil-
liams passed away shortly before 
midnight in his hometown of Palatka, Fla. 
The medical examiner confirmed 
the cause of death was an acute asth-
ma attack.
His passing came as a shock to the 
Palatka community.
Williams had started volunteer-
ing as a football coach at Interlachen 
High School in Putnam County ear-lier this year. 
Principal Phyllis Criswell said he 
appeared to be in good shape and 
perfectly healthy at practice on Tues-
day afternoon.
“This has been very hard on our 
football players ... they have grown 
to care about Jarvis and were looking 
forward to their game this Friday,” Criswell said. “Now they’ll be play-ing in dedication to him.”
The team is scheduled to play a 
scrimmage game on Friday.
Jerome Wilkerson had been friends 
with Williams since his senior year of high school. He said he hopes Wil-
liams is remembered as a great fam-
ily man.“He was always smiling, always 
laughing. He was a person you loved to be around,” he said.
Williams got his start as a safety at 
the University of Florida and was in-
ducted into the Athletic Hall of Fame 
in 2001.
He played with the Dolphins from 
1988-1993, and later joined the New York Giants for his final season in 
1994.
Former Gators and Dolphins 
teammate Louis Oliver remembered 
Williams’ famous tackle of University 
of Miami standout 
Melvin Bratton in 1986 as “the hit that resonated around 
the country.” 
Oliver said he 
has never seen any-
thing like it in foot-
ball before or since.
Nat Moore, vice president of 
Alumni Relations for the Dolphins, called Williams’ death a tragedy.
“Jarvis Williams ... was not only 
a personal friend but a tremendous football player for both the Dolphins and the Gators,” Moore said in a state-ment Wednesday. “He dedicated his 
life to coaching and helping young 
people and it’s a real tragedy for him to pass away at such an early age.”

ball for Jacksonville University.Ex-Gators safety passes

UF pitcher Stephanie Brombacher (32) has filled in the void left by former ace 
Stacey Nelson, and helped the Gators remain an elite program this season.
SEC and Pac-10 battle for conference supremacy in Super Region alsUF looks for individual NCAA titlesGators’ late-inning rally falls short 
off of back-to-back WCWS appearances, but 
were still facing questions about if they could maintain that greatness in the post-Stacey 
Nelson era.
Walton feels those questions have been an-
swered. 
“I’m just happy about being able to set 
goals and achieve regional success,” Walton 
said. “Moving on to Super Regionals is huge for stability in your program. 
“I think I said in the beginning of the year, 
it’s going to be one of the most important 
years of our program because of how much 
success we’ve had in the past and whether or not we’d be able to transition from one pitch-er to the other, and I think Stephanie (Brom-
bacher) answered that call.”
While Florida can use this weekend to 
cement itself as one of the NCAA’s premier 
softball programs, the SEC can use it to assert 
itself as the nation’s top conference. 
Last season, the SEC accounted for three of 
the final four teams in the WCWS, but were 
still unable to come away with the league’s 
first national championship as Washington 
pulled through to give the Pacific 10 its 21st title. The Huskies knocked off Florida last season 
in the championship series. Washington swept 
the Gators in the best-of-three series behind dominant performances by ace Danielle Lawrie, who gave up just one earned run in 14 innings 
of work.
This year, both conferences got seven 
teams into the NCAA tournament, with six Pac-10 teams and four SEC teams advancing 
to Super Regionals. 
As things currently stand, the Pac-10 has 
the edge over the SEC, boasting a 19-2 record 
to the SEC’s 15-6. 
But that could very easily change this 
weekend, as the conferences will collide when Florida takes on Arizona State and Georgia meets California. 
If the Gators can advance they will move 
themselves one step closer to a championship and bring their conference one step closer to national supremacy. snapped by Lindsay Burdette in a 6-3, 6-3 loss 
at the No. 2 spot.
No. 9 Lauren Embree swung the momen-
tum back in Florida’a favor with an upset 
against No. 4 Hilary Barte 6-4, 6-4.
With the match tied, three Gators who lost 
their first sets were all in the middle of trying 
to put together come-from-behind wins.
Caroline Hitimana fell short of a comeback 
at court No. 6 , but a win by Joanna Mather meant the championship trophy came down to No. 65 Boonstra and No. 33 Mallory Bur-dette.
Boonstra fell short in the first set, 6-4, but 
edged Burdette in the second, 7-6.
Boonstra battled to a 5-4 lead in the third, 
but Burdette held service to tie the match 5-5. After Burdette took the following game, Boon-stra failed to force another tiebreaker, losing the set 7-5.Individual Championships: An impres-
sive run that included singles wins over Nos. 
4, 7, 10 and 11 came to end for No. 8 Embree.
No. 35 California’s Mari Andersson 
knocked off the ITA National Rookie of the 
Year in the three sets 6-1, 1-6, 6-2.
After amassing a 26-match winning streak, 
Will made sure her losing streak stopped at one.
The No. 8 freshman 
bounced back from Tues-
day’s loss with a 6-1, 6-1 win 
over Washington State’s No. 61 Liudmila Vasilieva on Wednesday.

stra will be joining Will for the round of 32 in the doubles portion of the NCAA Individual Championship.
They will be joined by the No. 29 team of 
Embree and Mather.kept Johnson in until the fourth inning. The southpaw was finally pulled after giving up a double and single to sophomore Tyler Ha-nover and first baseman Blake Dean, who both scored later in the inning.
Unlike Johnson, LSU ace Anthony Ranaudo 
redeemed a nightmare outing against Florida on April 30, when the Gators chased the right hander after two innings. Ranaudo, a project-
ed top-10 pick in the MLB Draft before the sea-
son, recorded five strike outs while throwing a season-high 7.2 innings on Wednesday.
“You got to tip your cap to him,” UF center 
fielder Matt den Dekker said. “He battled and gave them a great chance to win.”
If the Gators can take anything positive 
from Wednesday’s game, it is there effort in the eighth inning. Den Dekker led off the frame 
with his 12th long ball of the season. Freshman 
Austin Maddox then singled and right fielder Daniel Piggot drew a walk to force Ranaudo out of the contest.
Both base runners scored later in the frame, 
cutting LSU’s lead to 9-6. But the Tigers added an insurance run in the ninth and reliever Paul Bertuccini closed the door on the Gators in the ninth.
Seven Gators recorded a hit on Wednesday, 
led by Den Dekker, who drove in three runs with his homer and a fifth-inning double. And, despite his struggles on the mound, Johnson went 3 for 4 from the plate.
But UF was still outhit 19-11.
After clinching the regu-
lar-season title last weekend against South Carolina, Flori-da appeared to suffer from a 
hangover Wednesday. Mad-
dox spoiled a potential rally in the fourth by over-running 
third base, and even the shore-handed Nolan Fontana committed his third error of the sea-son.
“They were really flat,” O’Sullivan said of 
his team. “I could tell before we stretched. I un-derstand what we accomplished in the regu-
lar season, but it’s a separate season. We can’t 
just turn it on and turn it off. We talked about that. We can’t just go through the motions this weekend then next weekend go ahead and turn it on full speed.”

Steam coming from the quarter-
back’s mouth. The Statue of Liberty 
in the distance. NFL championship at stake.
Live from new Meadowlands 
Stadium, it’s Super Bowl 2014.
NFL owners voted Tuesday for 
a title game that could be like no other. While there have been sub-40s temperatures for an outdoor Super Bowl, and it’s snowed out-side a domed stadium on game day, never has the league chosen to hold 
its marquee event in a place where 
players and fans could be freezing at kickoff.
They decided it was worth the 
risk to bring the Super Bowl to the New York area, and to the new $1.6 billion stadium that this season will become home to the New York Jets and Giants.
“We promise the greatest game 
in the greatest venue in the greatest city,” Giants co-owner Steve Tisch said. “Now we’ve got to deliver.”
The NFL has required an average 
temperature of 50 degrees or a dome for a team to even bid on hosting the Super Bowl, but the league bent the rule to let New York bid.
“Everyone knows it’s risky,” 
said Miami Dolphins owner Ste-phen Ross, one of two Florida teams whose bids were rejected.
The coldest kickoff temperature 
in Super Bowl history was 39 de-grees, and that would be consid-ered a warm February day in East Rutherford, N.J. Average February 
temperatures there are 24 to 40 de-
grees, with several inches of rain, ac-cording to the bid documents.
“I do believe that New York is a 
unique market and the membership recognized that,” said NFL commis-sioner Roger Goodell. “I think it will 
turn out to be a great event.”
Being just outside the Big Apple 
means lots of glitz and spectacle. 
Buildup will include everything from a float in the Macy’s Thanks-giving Day parade to parties at inter-nationally renowned destinations. 
The flip side is that security will 
become a bigger issue, perhaps 
among the most expensive pieces of 
the budget. An expected economic impact of $550 million would help offset some of the cost.
Tuesday’s vote had been widely 
considered a formality, but it didn’t play out that way. Even after Miami was eliminated, it took two more rounds of voting for New York to 
get the nod over Tampa.
“New York knows how to put on 
an event,” Ross said, putting aside 
his weather warnings. 
“It’s not like you lost to some small town that doesn’t know how to put on big events.”
It’s billed as a one-
time exception, but players are split on the decision.
In the Pittsburgh Steelers’ locker 
room, quarterback Byron Leftwich said the weather doesn’t matter “because it’s the Super Bowl ... and you’re not going to let 15 degrees change anything.” But linebacker James Farrior countered, “I play 
enough games in the cold.”
It’s been at least 57 degrees for 
kickoff of every Super Bowl since 
1975, when it was 46.
Odds are, the NFL will wait and 
see how this foray into the great out-doors in winter goes before consid-ering another such bid. 
The 2014 game will be held Feb. 
2nd, 9th or 16th, depending on how that season’s schedule is set up.NY gets Super Bowl

The phones started ringing at 
2 a.m., and players were told to 
come down to the third floor for a meeting. As Herculez Gomez 
pressed the elevator button on 17, 
his mind raced.
Were his dreams about to be 
fulfilled -- or crushed?
This is the way the U.S. World 
Cup team was finalized, in the dead of night in a Hartford hotel.“It’s been such a crazy and un-
believable journey,” Gomez said.
And the big trip hasn’t even 
begun.
For Gomez, it was good news. 
He and Edson Buddle went from long shots to the American ros-
ter Wednesday, joining veterans 
Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley and Tim Howard on the 23-man U.S. team headed to South Africa.
While there was joy and relief for the chosen, there was only 
heartache and anguish for the 
seven players called downstairs 
a few minutes earlier, the players 
leaving the group selected May 11 for the preliminary roster, only to be cut four days before depar-
ture.
At the start of the year, Gomez 
and Buddle weren’t even after-
thoughts. Neither was listed in the team’s 2010 media guide.
A 28-year-old from Las Vegas, 
Gomez scored 10 goals for Puebla to tie for the Mexican scoring lead, becoming the first American to 
top a foreign league. The 29-year-
old Buddle leads Major League Soccer with nine goals for the Los 
Angeles Galaxy. 
They were chosen over Brian 
Ching, who only returned May 
13 from a hamstring injury.
Beasley also had a remarkable 
turnaround and will be going to his third World Cup. He teamed with Donovan to spark the Amer-icans to a quarterfinal appearance 
in 2002. Then he was part of the 
disappointing team eliminated in the first round four years ago.
He was exiled from the na-
tional team after poor play at the Confederations Cup last June, but returned for the March exhibition at the Netherlands.
Beasley made a strong show-
ing at the training camp that be-gan May 17.
“He certainly had to prove 
himself,” Bradley said. “He needed to make a renewed com-mitment to the team, a renewed commitment to doing things as a player that make his team better. We’ve seen that.”
Bradley selected three goal-
keepers, seven defenders, nine midfielders and four forwards.
Forward Jozy Altidore at 20 is 
the youngest player. The average age is just under 27, down from 28.5 at the 2006 tournament.
Donovan, with a U.S. record 
42 goals in 121 appearances, is the most experienced player and Buddle the least. Of the 43 players in qualifying, 19 made the roster.24, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 27, 2010

While it was a great accom-
plishment, the Southeastern 
Conference Outdoor Champi-onship was just an appetizer 
for the outdoor season.
This weekend the Gators 
track and field teams are pre-
pared for the entrée and ready 
for the opportunity to taste the 
dessert.  
Both the men and wom-
en’s teams begin their NCAA championship ambitions today 
when they participate in the 
three-day NCAA Preliminary Rounds in Greensboro, N.C. 
Hot off its first SEC Outdoor 
Championship since 1987, the men’s team enters the meet as the nation’s No. 1 ranked team. The women’s team, which fin-ished a close second to LSU 
at SEC’s, also enters the meet 
ranked in the nation’s top 10, sitting at number six. 
Florida head coach Mike 
Holloway, recently named SEC Men’s Head Coach of the Year, said he was proud of both teams at SEC’s, and that both are ready to compete and 
qualify this coming weekend. 
“We just got to do what 
we’ve been doing,” he said.  
Unlike the previous seven 
years, the 2010 campaign is the 
first season for the NCAA Pre-
liminary Rounds. The NCAA 
moved from the four-region format to the two regionals, East and West. 
North Carolina A&T Uni-
versity is hosting the East Re-gional, while the University of 
Texas at Austin is hosting the 
West Regional. 
There are no winners this 
weekend, only qualifiers. 
The fields of each individu-
al event consist of 48 athletes with the top 12 advancing to the NCAA Outdoor Champi-onships. The top 12 teams also 
advance from the 24 teams 
competing in each relay. 
The Florida men enter the 
preliminary rounds leading 
the East Region in six differ-
ent events: Kemal Mesic in the shot put, Calvin Smith in the 400-meter dash and the top 4x100 meter relay and 4x400 
meter relay teams. Christian 
Taylor, recent-
ly named SEC Men’s Field Ath-
lete of the Year, 
is the East Re-gional’s top long 
jumper and top triple jumper. 
The women’s team leads the 
East Regional in three differ-ent events led by SEC Female Field Athlete of the Year Mar-iam Kevkhishvili in the shot 
put. Charlotte Browning in 
the 1,500-meter run and Shara Proctor in the long jump also lead the region in their respec-
tive events. 
After the SEC’s were marred 
with inclement weather and 
long delays, Holloway said he 
expects much of the same this 
weekend during the prelimi-nary rounds.
“It always rains,” he said. “I 
haven’t checked it [weather], but I always expect it to rain.”Gators set for
