NEW CASTLE, Del. — A couple of fish-
ing buddies from Delaware have been catch-
ing more than just bass. They’ve been help-ing police reel in cars.
Larry Newirth and Dan Cathell spotted a 
white BMW 750 sedan on June 17. 
Then on Friday, they found a late-model 
Honda Accord. 
Police say the cars were stolen and aban-
doned. No arrests have been made.Newirth, a 63-year-old retired carpenter, 
jokes that he and Cathell better stop finding cars or the police will think they’re the ones stealing them. 
Cathell, a 44-year-old millwright, says 
he hopes the thieves stop dumping the cars from the boat ramp so police don’t close the dock to the public.

Spectators watch fireworks launched from Hume Field from the roof of UF’s Parking Garage V on Saturday. The display was part of Fanfares and Fireworks, a Fourth of July weekend celebration at Flavet Field that returned after being canceled in 2009 due to budget cuts. The fireworks were scheduled to go off at 9:40 p.m. but were delayed slightly due to heavy rain.
SHANDS AT UF

Vroom!
That’s the sound that emanat-
ed from a high-definition TV in 
a new playroom at Shands Chil-dren’s Hospital. To Frank Din-
kins, playing a NASCAR video 
game symbolizes the race to fight pediatric cancer.
Frank received a heart trans-
plant in November of 2009. He 
is one of the cancer patients who 
receive a new room at Shands Children’s Hospital’s pediatric oncology and hematology unit 
that opens today, Dr. Bill Slayton 
said Thursday.
The unit’s renovations, which 
is funded by a combined $500,000 donation from The V Foundation 
for Cancer Research and The 
NASCAR Foundation, will bring patients with compromised im-mune systems together and allow 
them to receive better care, said 
Slayton, the interim chief of the new unit.
The First and 15 Founda-
tion, founded by former Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and two friends, Ryan Moseley and 
David Sinopoli, 
also donated 
$156,000 for the 
unit’s high-tech playroom.
The play-
room allows patients, like Frank, to play 
a video game in the room while connected to sicker patients who 
aren’t able to leave their own 
rooms, Slayton said.
For Sinopoli, who had leuke-
mia and severe aplastic anemia 
late 2001, he said the worst part Children’s unit

� UF CAN CUSTOMIZE SAKAI 
TO SUIT STUDENTS’ NEEDS.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Writer
There’s a new course-manage-
ment system in town. 
Most Summer B online courses 
and all fall online courses will be 
hosted on Sakai, UF’s new course-
management system.
Blackboard, the company that 
owns the software, will stop sup-
porting WebCT Vista 8, the e-Learn-
ing system UF has used, in Decem-ber 2011. 
Fedro Zazueta headed up a 
UF committee that searched for a 
replacement. The committee nar-rowed it down to three platforms: 
ANGEL, Moodle and Sakai. Sakai was chosen unanimously.
Sakai is an open-source platform, 
which means UF can customize it to better suit its students’ needs. It also means that although UF doesn’t need to pay for licenses, like it did with WebCT, it has to spend more money on a programming team, Zazueta said. 
Sakai was cheaper than ANGEL 
and more expensive than Moodle, a review committee report said.
But cost wasn’t the only factor in 
the decision, Zazueta said. While the committee could have found other systems that were cheaper, UF was looking for a more comprehensive UF’s debuts new 
e-Learning platform

A little more than a week ago, 
Justin and his friends walked into 
Modern Age Tobacco and bought their first bong. 
It’s a foot-long, blue bong with 
gold decorations they affectionate-ly named “Kim Bong Il.”
Because of a new Florida bill 
that went into effect Thursday, they may have to change their plans to buy their next bong, which they plan to call “Mao Zebong.”
Gov. Charlie Crist signed a bill 
banning sales of bongs, pipes and other devices that could be used for smoking marijuana--but only by stores that receive 25 percent of 
their annual revenue from the sale 
of such items. 
Robert Rush, the lawyer for 
Modern Age Tobacco 
and Gift Shop Inc. on University Avenue, said the shop he rep-
resents will not be affected because its bong and pipe sales are less than 
25 percent of its total inventory and 
sales. 
The situation is similar to police 
officers pulling over speeding cars, Rush said. “They’re not going to stop a car 
that’s not speeding just because it’s a red, fancy-looking sports car,” he 
said. 
Instead, he said, the law is aim-
ing at other businesses in Florida 
that are selling bongs and pipes almost exclusively. These shops are colloquially known as “head shops.”
Local attorney Ed Garvin ques-
tioned the  constitutionality in the 
bill. 
“You’re not basically criminal-
izing behavior, per se,” he said. ‘Bong bill’ affects head shops

  Middle-school students enrolled in 
an upcoming east Gainesville summer 
camp will be shooting for the stars, thanks to a grant by the National Sci-ence Foundation.
  The Math and Science Summer 
Camp, sponsored by Santa Fe College’s East Gainesville Initiative, is a com-munity-building educational program intended to teach underprivileged stu-dents the value of learning more about math and science.
Forty girls and boys will participate 
in the summer camp between July 12 
and 17.  Participating students were 
picked by teachers, community leaders and church groups for their academic achievements and good behavior in school, said Karen Cole-Smith, SFC’s 
head of the initiative. 
  UF is joining the program for the 
ﬁ  rst time since SFC created it in 2002. 
The camp will be partially sponsored and taught by UF professors Stephen Eikenberry and Norman Fitz-Coy, who 
will introduce the astronomical cur-riculum with the ﬁ  nancial backing of a grant from the NSF.   Eikenberry’s in-
volvement will add astronomy to the camp’s schedule, Cole-Smith said.
  “These programs are here to intro-
duce these children to the larger con-cepts of the world,”  Eikenberry said. “[This includes] how we know what we know about the universe, as well as 
classes that teach life 
building skills.”
  Days are split into 
two curricula: a math and science track during the morning and “life classes” in the afternoon, which include topics such as culinary arts, CPR 
certiﬁ  cation and conﬂ  ict resolution.
  “Our goal is not to have a summer 
camp that is fun, but one that is instruc-tional,” Cole-Smith said. “But we do want to show that science and math can be fun with some of the different classes we have planned.”
  Some of the classes include building 
solar telescopes, visiting the Kika Silva 
Pla Planetarium at Santa Fe College and 
building pocket satellites, she said.    Professors join camp

  While freshmen are still adjusting to cam-
pus life during Summer B, some UF members are already searching for ways to welcome back alumni and recognize seasoned Gators.
  Voting to nominate professors for sev-
eral awards during Education Celebration, a Homecoming event honoring select faculty members on Oct. 6, will  begin this month, ac-cording to Jessica Clements, the Homecoming 2010 general chair. 
  “We want to show the professors that we 
appreciate the hard work that they put forth in improving our academics,” Clements said.
  Once everything has been approved by the 
Ofﬁ  ce of the Provost, the online voting will be set up on the Homecoming website at ufhome-coming.org, she said.
  Four professors will receive the Distin-
guished Faculty Award, two will receive the Distinguished Mentor Award and one de-partment will receive the new Departmental Award, said Alvancin Louis, director of Edu-cation Celebration.  A selection committee, which is made up 
of four faculty members chosen by UF Provost Joseph Glover, will go through the applica-tions and choose the winners, Louis said.
  The number of years the professors have 
been teaching, the difﬁ  culty of their courses and the number of grant writings they have received for research will go into considering a winner, Louis said. 
  The event used to be a reception, but Louis 
said the Education Celebration committee hopes to make the event bigger this year, beginning with a business-casual banquet 
and reception followed by a sit-down dinner. 
  “It is our privilege to host this event,” Louis 
said.
  In addition to online voting, applications 
for organizations that want to build a ﬂ  oat for 
the Homecoming Parade and for Gator Raid-
ers, which is a group for students who help promote Gator Growl and Homecoming, are now available on the website.
  “It’s a great way for freshmen to get in-
volved,” said Grace Faulkenberry, associate general chair.  Homecoming voting starts

StudentLife■ THE FORMER GOP CHAIRMAN 
FACES CHARGES OF THEFT, FRAUD AND MONEY LAUNDERING.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — A criminal defense attor-
ney for ousted Florida GOP chairman Jim 
Greer Monday promised to make defense 
witnesses of some of the most powerful 
men in Florida politics — Gov. Charlie Crist, Attorney General Bill McCollum and state Republican chief John Thrasher.
J. Cheney Mason also said he’ll depose 
prospective Florida House Speaker Dean 
Cannon, R-Winter Park, and soon-to-be 
Florida Senate President Mike Haridopo-lis, R-Merritt Island. 
Greer, his lawyer said, was the victim 
of right-wing conservatives who turned against Crist, the man who picked Greer to head the state party, and decided to pun-ish the governor by ruining Greer.“I believe we’ll be able to prove Jim 
Greer is not guilty whatsoever,” said Ma-son.
Greer, 48, of Oviedo, was indicted in 
May by a statewide grand jury that charged him of six felonies, including theft, orga-nized fraud and money laundering. 
Records released by the Florida De-
partment of Law Enforcement and Office 
of Statewide Prosecution accuse Greer of 
funneling $125,000 from the state party into his personal bank accounts.
Greer was not at Monday’s Orlando 
news conference, and Mason would not discuss the evidence against Greer, much of which splashed into the news last week as prosecutors released to the public hun-dreds of pages of documents — the nuts 
and bolts of their case.
Instead, Mason denounced state GOP 
officials and their motives, especially Mc-
Collum, whose Office of Statewide Pros-
ecution handled the grand jury investiga-tion and is now trying to convict Greer.
In the next 10 days, Mason said, he 
would ask Orange Circuit Judge Marc Lu-
bet to disqualify the Office of Statewide 
Prosecution. 
Mason said McCollum, a candidate for 
governor, has “severe conflicts of inter-
est.”
McCollum was a Greer 
favorite and recipient of 
state party money, but shortly after the first of the year, when party 
leaders learned that a Greer-owned company was getting a portion of 
every major contribution to the Republi-can Party of Florida, McCollum, Cannon 
and Haridopolis helped force him out.
McCollum then called for a criminal in-
vestigation.
On the day Greer was arrested, June 2, 
William Shepherd, head of the Office of Statewide Prosecution, told reporters that 
McCollum had no conflict.
“We are a separate, independent consti-
tutional entity,” Shepherd said of the Of-
fice of Statewide Prosecution. “I have not 
spoken to the attorney general since this case began.”
Gerald Bailey, head of the Florida De-
partment of Law Enforcement, the agency 
that did the investigative legwork, said 
that same day that McCollum wasn’t his boss, that the governor and cabinet are.
Former state GOP executive director 
Delmar Johnson III, of Winter Garden, has agreed to testify against Greer in exchange for immunity. 
According to state records, Johnson 
pocketed $65,000, money he has agreed to 
repay.
Mason today called Johnson “a little 
marionette for the prosecution. His deal 
calls for him to say what they want him to 
say, when they want him to say it.”By KAT BEIN

Rob Zeller moved to Gainesville 
in 1993 to study chemical engineer-
ing at UF, but when he graduated in 1995 he decided to hang around for a while.
Finding no engineering jobs, 
he opened the Grog House Bar on West University Avenue. He was successful over the next few years and expanded to buy Copper Mon-key, Gator City Sports Grill and the downtown cowboy club :08.
Now, the 39-year-old from 
Ohio is demonstrating his affinity 
for Gainesville by running for city 
commissioner of District 3.
“I didn’t leave Gainesville be-
cause I fell in love with Gainesville,” Zeller said in an interview Friday. “Now I see it falling apart . . . I don’t want to see this happen.”
People are dealing with the hard-
est economic times of their lives, he 
said. They need city commissioners 
who can bring a business mind to the city’s problems.
“I understand how to cut and 
make strong decisions,” Zeller said. “I ran a large organization for many years. Education-wise, expe-rience-wise, I have a proven track 
record.”If elected, Zeller said he would 
fight hard against increases in taxes 
and GRU rates as well as any cuts to the Gainesville Police Department or Alachua County Fire Rescue. 
He said he also hopes to tackle 
traffic congestion downtown and eliminate what he sees as over-reg-ulation of small businesses.
“We’ve got to cut spending and 
still provide the best services avail-able,” Zeller said. “I’m not a politi-cian. I want to bring common sense and a business mind to the city.”
Zeller said he wants to be a 
fresh, new voice on the commis-sion, which he thinks is made up of like-minded individuals.
“I want to be the people’s advo-
cate,” he said. “I think [the current commissioners] have pet projects and don’t really care about what the people want.”
Zeller said he wants voters to 
know he’ll be listening to their voic-es throughout his campaign and, if elected, during his time as commis-sioner.
“I want to actually find out 
what’s going to make the people happier,” he said. “I’m always here. I work every day. Come sit down with me at the Copper Monkey. Have an ice-cold tea and talk about your issues.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 6, 2010

The Academy for Five Ele-
ment Acupuncture, located at 305 
SE Second Ave., is celebrating the graduation of its first Gainesville class.
Founded in Hallandale in 
1998, the school moved from Bro-ward County to Gainesville three years ago looking for a greener environment.
The academy offers a three-
year intensive program that draws students from all over the country. 
For the first two years of the 
acupuncture program, students come to Gainesville throughout 
the year for two-week study ses-
sions. 
Students move to Gainesville 
in their third year, at which point they begin working with real pa-tients.
The 17 new graduates earned 
their master’s degrees in the an-
cient Chinese medicine, although 
many of them already have de-grees and careers in areas such as journalism, history and social 
work.Ming Su, 52, was born in Chi-
na and worked in the aerospace 
industry for 20 years before en-rolling in the local academy. 
“I need to do something I 
like,” Su said about her decision to go back to school. “I think acu-
puncture is my calling. I want to 
help people. I’m very excited to be here.”
Carrie Hall, 34, used to work 
in sales until her yoga instructor talked her into trying acupunc-ture. 
She was so pleased with the 
results she decided it was time for a career change.
“I can’t believe someone’s 
going to pay me to do this,” she said. “This is awesome!”
Hall moved here from Michi-
gan but plans to stay in Gainesville and open her own practice. 
Like Hall, quite a few gradu-
ates have been tempted to stay in the area.
But no matter where they set 
up shop, the graduates know the friendships they’ve made will 
last for the rest of their lives.
“I know there are 12 people 
in the world who I can call any-
where, anytime,” Hall said.TUESDAY, JULY 6, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5

0 TOTAL VOTESN/A YESN/A NOThursday’s question: Due to technical difficulties, the poll results are unavailable.Today’s question: Should stores be allowed to sell water pipes?I already have enough reasons to question the legitimacy of graduating from UF: Ron Zook, Jesse Palmer — The Bachelor, really? — and Mike Mularkey (just because of 
his name).
I don’t want another reason, but apparently one UF stu-
dent thinks I do.
Cameron Schmidt, a 22-year-old UF student, was “arrest-
ed and charged with trafficking large amounts of marijuana and cocaine late Tuesday night after attempting to run from police officers,” according to an Alligator article Thursday.
Schmidt, after confessing to cocaine possession, told po-
lice that he can’t go to jail because he’s in school.
I don’t know what imbecilic twit told him that being a 
UF student gives him the right to stupidity, but his idiocy is ruining the validity of my future degree.
When did it become part of the college experience to get 
arrested for drugs? And when did “I’m in school” become 
the reason that police shouldn’t arrest you?
I get that UF has been considered a party school long be-
fore Schmidt thought it would be a nice idea to walk around 
with a red plastic cup and drugs and a gun in his backpack. And I get that the temptation to get a little bit un-“kosher” at college can be overwhelming, but please, just don’t.
Part of the college experience is learning when not to ex-
periment and when to learn from others’ mistakes.
For the idiots shooting off fireworks aimed at each other 
Sunday night, I saw you later that night “doing the Techni-color yawn” (AKA puking) before passing out.
UF newbies take notice. You may be new, and this may 
be your second week at UF, but alcohol-induced blackouts aren’t the way to go.
Jane Not-a-real-person thinks that college is about booze, 
Adderall and Edward Cullen-like all-nighters. But that is why Ms. Not-a-real-person is gonna be living with her par-ents until she is 35. And while she is wishing she were as successful as Erin Andrews (a perfectly respect-able, smokin’ hot Telecommunica-
tions ’00 alum), the rest of us will be interviewing for jobs explaining that UF isn’t just a party school.
And it isn’t just Joe Schmoes who ruin our degrees. Re-
member J.J.? 
Our beloved former Student Body president got himself 
cited for disorderly conduct by the University Police Depart-ment last semester for demanding that SNAP take him to his

If I wanted to only be known for drinking and saying 
stupid things (see J.J.’s and Schmidt’s earlier quotes), then I would’ve auditioned for “Jersey Shore.”
Or worse. I would’ve chosen to be a “crimiNOLE,” or I 
would’ve gone to Thug U in Miami.
I’m not trying to say UF students can’t have fun, or that 
UF students have to be straight-laced Tebow impersonators. I’m just saying that if you’re going to do something stupid, do it at home, not in public.
Besides, UF students are distracting cops from more im-
portant things (like dressing as citizens and walking in front of cars to track the percentage of “Gainesville drivers yield-ing to pedestrians” or giving tickets to drivers who go 35 mph in a 30 mph zone).
Or legislators could just do the wise thing — legalize 
drugs, and use that tax money to reduce my tuition costs.
Andrew Pantazi is a journalism senior.Stupidity decreases value of UF degreeIt became a crime to sell pipes and bongs in the state of 
Florida on Thursday unless the store selling them gets at least 75 percent of its revenue from tobacco sales. Accord-
ing to the state, these devices are not being used to smoke tobacco, but illegal drugs, so they have every right to crimi-nalize them.
Hey, why not? We think the state should have done this a 
long time ago. For too long retailers been getting away with selling products that people can do whatever they want with, and it needs to stop. For now, pipes and bongs are a great start, but we would like to see Florida lawmakers ramp up their efforts — big time.
There are literally thousands of products that big, bad lo-
cal businesses have been getting away with selling that are ruining our state. People sometimes smoke illegal drugs out of paper as if it was a cigarette, or apples as if they were 
pipes. We have even heard tales of some really twisted peo-
ple desecrating aluminum soda cans to get high if they are desperate enough for their fix. Forget raiding head shops for their contraband—we need to call the state militia on Publix for recklessly selling two-liter bottles to kids who are just go-
ing to pour out the sugar water and craft it into a bong.
It would take way too much time and money to investi-
gate all these crimes on a case-by-case basis, so it just makes 
more sense to nip it all in the bud by making any product 
that can be used in a less-than-desirable way illegal to sell. 
We are not paying police, sheriff’s deputies, state troopers and countless federal law enforcement officers to establish probable cause, collect evidence and build an airtight case against drug users and sellers. We pay them to give us traffic 
tickets, arrest drunk people and respond to noise complaints. 
“Investigations” would overload them.
We want to make sure we do our part. So in order to better 
facilitate a drug-free Florida, we encourage everyone to call 
their state representative and demand he or she vote to ban 
the following commercially available products: felt-tip mark-ers, lighters, all forms of adhesives except for Elmer’s Glue, sugar cubes, spray paint (especially metallic colors), fruit, brownie mix, tea, hookahs, straws, mirrors, razor blades, 
any plastic bag smaller than sandwich-size, gas masks and 
of course spoons.
Drug users usually do not have a lick of ingenuity, so after 
we are successful in getting each of these products banned 
they will more than likely give up trying to get high in the 
Sunshine State and move to somewhere else. Probably some backward state that believes prosecuting drug crimes is a waste of government funds. If only those subversive corners of our more-perfect union would wake up and see how Flor-
ida has transformed thousands of yearly drug-related arrests 
into a veritable boon to our economy. If we could just cut spending on those pesky prevention and rehabilitation pro-grams, Florida would be rolling in money, Scrooge McDuck 
style.
What about how all these new laws will affect retailers, 
many of whom are already struggling from reduced tourism 
and a poor economy? Hopefully they will be forced to close their doors as punishment for their heinous crimes against 
society. And to think, this could have all been avoided if they 
would have taken a little more responsibility for our actions instead of trying to make a quick buck.Bad Bong

Pascal’s offers mellow environment for 
coffee drinkers 
I was disappointed that Thursday’s ar-
ticle about free Wi-Fi at Starbucks failed 
to mention an important local coffee shop: 
Pascal’s. 
Serving handcrafted drinks made from 
organic, fair-trade Sweetwater coffee and 
pastries from local bakeries, Pascal’s is tru-
ly a gem for Gainesville coffee drinkers. 
We offer free Wi-Fi, plenty of seating 
and a quiet, mellow atmosphere. This sum-
mer we have self-serve drip coffee avail-able, and in the fall a full bar will be open 
for all to enjoy. 
Located within the Christian Study Cen-
ter, we are only two blocks north of cam-
pus at 112 NW 16th St. For those who really 
care about their coffee, Pascal’s is an obvi-
ous choice.

� � �Tax can help prevent skin cancer
Your article about the federal tan tax 
addressed the concerns of small-business owners, but it did not convey the compel-
ling, irrefutable scientific evidence that 
shows the use of indoor tanning beds can increase the risk for skin cancer.
Dermatologists are particularly alarmed 
about the impact of indoor tanning on young women. Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is increasing faster in young women than in young men, and women are far more likely to use indoor 
tanning beds. 
Indoor tanning is associated with a 75 
percent increase in the risk of melanoma. 
Melanoma is now the most common form 
of cancer for young adults 25-29 years old 
and is the second most common form of cancer for adolescents and young adults 15 to 29 years old.
Our goal is to protect the public from 
the known dangers of UV radiation. The indoor tanning tax is an important step in reducing the use of indoor tanning and can 
ultimately prevent future skin cancers. 
Current scientific belief indicates that 
spray-on and mist tans are not harmful. 
Small-business owners can offer a dif-
ferent type of tanning service that is not 
harmful, and many of them already do.

Parking-ticket policy is frustrating
I recall people on Turlington Plaza 
protesting UF parking. I am writing to en-courage their demonstrations. I recently 
received a parking citation for my scooter. 
While I can say the citation (for sidewalk parking) is incorrect, I would also like to point out that I am the type of person 
who never breaks rules, no matter what. 
But through this ticket-receiving process I have witnessed with my own eyes how evil the UFPD parking enforcement is. 
When a scooter owner receives a ticket, 
he or she is not informed of this until three 
to four business days later by mail. From 
there, the owner is told he or she can ei-ther pay or appeal. My first instinct was to appeal because I knew I had done nothing wrong. I then realized that by not receiv-
ing a ticket on site, I had no physical proof 
of my innocence. It would then take four to six weeks to find out the decision of the appeal, and a late fee would be applied af-
ter 15 days. 
Do the math, and you’ll understand 
my frustration. Having overpaid before, I 
can also say that UF does not do this crazy thing called a “refund.”  So here’s to you 
guys out there spreading the word about 
how UFPD makes money off students working their way through college: Good job and keep with it!

Skirt length. Lipstick. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Is-
sue. Not generally things you would correlate with the stock market.
But the theories are out there. Take the first, for instance, 
which states that the higher the skirts, the better the outlook 
for stocks. This is because lengthier skirts are worn throughout 
pessimistic eras while their more abbreviated counterparts are worn during periods of optimism.
The lipstick indicator, though, is more of a monetary expres-
sion of interests. Lipstick tends to be purchased in greater quan-tities during poorer economic times as it is a modest luxury.
Unlike the former indicator, this one has some merit as it 
was “coined by Leonard Lauder (chairman of Estee Lauder), who consistently found that during tough economic times, his 
lipstick sales went up.” This gauge is described as a “leading” 
indicator, meaning that it attempts to foretell future events in the economy rather than a “lagging” indicator which looks at past events.
Next, the Sports Illustrated indicator, created by Bespoke 
Investment Group, attempts to estimate the returns of the Stan-dard and Poor’s 500, or S&P 500, a measure of the stock mar-ket. This indicator clarifies that there are higher stock market returns when there is an American model on the cover of the Swimsuit Issue and that these returns are lower when a non-native model appears on 
the cover, according to Investopedia.com. Interestingly enough, 
“between 1978 and 2008, the average return of the S&P 500 was 
10.5 percent; when the cover model was American, the average annual return was 13.9 percent. When the cover model was a foreigner, the average annual return was 7.2 percent.”
Kiplinger.com explains several more indicators for trying 
economic periods. As one will see, these gauges are a tad more contemplative, or more real-worldly, than above. We start first with the movies. It turns out, when a recession hits, individuals flock to the theaters for enjoyment, much the same way lipstick 
is a cheaper amenity during a hard stretch.
The National Association of Theatre Owners stated that, in 
the first quarter of 2009, ticket sales increased 9 percent. Like-
wise, in recessionary periods people look to the comfort of a night out.
Over the past seven years, dating website Match.com had 
its most visitors in the last three months of 2008, the period in which Lehman Brothers and AIG were causing mayhem in the markets.
The next indicator alleges the antithesis of the stereotypi-
cal consumption-driven American. The National Gardening Association declared a 19 percent jump in domestic gardening in 2009, seemingly to save a buck or two. Desperate times call 
for desperate measures, and in this case, we revert back to our 
agrarian roots, literally.
Finally, as somewhat of a tagalong to the lipstick indica-
tor, eyeliner and mascara sales increased 9 and 13 percent, re-spectively, for an annual episode commencing in March 2009. Though these indicators are somewhat dated, they portray in-teresting changes which come about from imperative lifestyle modification when money is tight.
Economics and finance are rarely used with the words 
“fun.” Hopefully, this snippet of humor will allow you to open up to these subjects and see them for what they can be: an in-sight into the world around us.
And if these don’t suit you, make your own. Test it. Maybe 
you’ll hit it rich, or at least have a little fun. I mean, the swim-suit edition is for learning purposes, right?

U-Wire� THE MOVE COMES ON THE EVE OF THE ISRAELI 
PRIME MINISTER’S TRIP TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
KEREM SHALOM CROSSING, Israel (AP) — Israel is eas-
ing its blockade of Hamas-ruled Gaza to allow in virtually all 
consumer goods, items from household cleaners to timber that had been barred from import for years.But because Israel will continue to ban most travel and ex-
ports and restrict the import of desperately needed construc-tion materials, the new rules are unlikely to restore the terri-tory’s devastated economy or allow rebuilding of all that was destroyed in last year’s war.
The White House welcomed the changes that were an-
nounced Monday as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Washington for a meeting with President Barack Obama. International Mideast envoy Tony Blair said Israel’s measures “should have a dramatic influence on the daily lives of the peo-ple of Gaza and on the private sector.”
The new blockade rules come in response to an outcry fol-
lowing a deadly Israeli raid on a blockade-busting flotilla at the end of May.
Gaza business leaders and rights activists said the measures 
are far short of what Gaza needs, and that the only active cargo crossing, Kerem Shalom, may not be enough to bring in all the goods now permitted.
Israeli officials said the remaining restrictions, including on 
exports, are essential for maintaining security.
On Monday, goods dropped off at Kerem Shalom included 
washing machines, which were previously banned from im-port. Aid supplies that had been transported on the intercepted flotilla also found their way to the crossing, including previ-
ously banned mattresses.
Israel started restricting movement of people and goods in 
and out of Gaza after the 2006 capture of an Israeli soldier, Sgt. 
Gilad Schalit, by Hamas-allied militants. A year later, when the Islamic militant Hamas overran Gaza, Israel — backed by Egypt — imposed a fuller closure, allowing in only a few dozen types of humanitarian goods like basic foods and medicine.
Israel says it will lift the blockade if Hamas releases the sol-
dier, recognizes Israel and renounces violence. Hamas, which is considered a terror organization by the U.S., Israel and the 
European Union, has rejected those terms.
Obama, who is hosting Netanyahu at the White House on 
Tuesday, has said the blockade is unsustainable and demanded 
that it be eased significantly. Other world leaders have asked for a complete lifting of the border closure. White House spokes-man Tommy Vietor said Monday that the new procedure “will make a significant improvement in the lives of people in Gaza, while keeping weapons out of the hands of Hamas.”
Israel said Monday that it began easing restrictions in the 
last two weeks and will continue to implement changes over the coming weeks. It published a list of goods it will continue to ban from Gaza, with everything else now permitted.
The banned items include weapons and “dual use” goods 
Israel fears might be diverted by Gaza militants for military purposes, such as fertilizers, gas tanks and water disinfectant.Israel eases restrictions on imports into Gaza stripTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TEXAS CITY, Texas (AP) — Tar 
balls from the Gulf oil spill found on a Texas beach were confirmed Monday as the first evidence that gushing crude from the Deepwater 
Horizon well has reached all the 
Gulf states.
A Coast Guard official said it was 
possible that the oil hitched a ride on a ship and was not carried naturally by currents to the barrier islands of the eastern Texas coast, but there was no way to know for sure.
The amount discovered is tiny 
in comparison to what has coated beaches so far in the hardest-hit parts of the Gulf coast in Louisi-ana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. It still provoked the quick dispatch of cleaning crews and a vow that BP will pay for the trouble.
“Any Texas shores impacted by 
the Deepwater spill will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab,” Texas Land Commis-soner Jerry Patterson said in a news release.
The oil’s arrival in Texas was pre-
dicted Friday by an analysis from the National Oceanic and Atmo-spheric Administration, which gave 
a 40 percent chance of crude reach-
ing the area.
“It was just a matter of time that 
some of the oil would find its way to Texas,” said Hans Graber, a ma-rine physicist at the University of Miami and co-director of the Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing.
About five gallons of tar balls were found Saturday on the Bolivar Peninsula, northeast of Galveston, 
said Capt. Marcus Woodring, the 
Coast Guard commander for the Houston/Galveston sector. Two gallons were found Sunday on the peninsula and Galveston Island, though tests have not yet confirmed its origin.
Woodring said the consistency 
of the tar balls indicates it’s possible 
they could have been spread to Tex-
as water by ships that have worked out in the spill. 
But there’s no way to confirm the 
way they got there.
The largest tar balls found Satur-
day were the size of ping-pong balls, while the ones found Sunday were the size of nickels and dimes.
Galveston Mayor Joe Jaworski 
said he believed the tar balls were a fluke, rather than a sign of what’s to come.
“This is good news,” he said. 
“The water looks good. We’re cau-tiously optimistic this is an anoma-ly.”
The distance between the west-
ern reach of the tar balls in Texas and the most eastern reports of oil in Florida is about 550 miles. 
Oil was first spotted on land near 
the mouth of the Mississippi River on April 29.
The spill is reaching deeper into 
Louisiana. Strings of oil were seen Monday in the Rigolets, one of two 
waterways that connect the Gulf 
with Lake Pontchartrain, the large lake north of New Orleans.
“So far it’s scattered stuff show-
ing up, mostly tar balls,” said Louisi-ana Office of Fisheries Assistant Sec-retary Randy Pausina. “It will pull out with the tide, and then show 
back up.”
Pausina said he expected the oil 
to clear the passes and move direct-
ly into the lake, taking a backdoor route to New Orleans.
The news of the spill’s reach 
comes at a time that most of the off-shore skimming operations in the Gulf have been halted by choppy 
seas and high winds. A tropical sys-
tem that had been lingering off Lou-isiana flared up Monday afternoon, bringing heavy rain and winds.
Forecasters at the National Hur-
ricane Center said there was a 60 percent of the storm becoming a tropical cyclone.
Last week, the faraway Hurri-
cane Alex idled the skimming fleet off Alabama, Florida and Mississip-pi with choppy seas and stiff winds. Now they’re stymied by a succes-sion of smaller storms that could last well into this week.
Officials have plans for the worst-
case scenario: a hurricane barreling 
up the Gulf toward the spill site. 
But the less-dramatic weather con-ditions have been met with a more makeshift response.
Skimming operations across the 
Gulf have scooped up about 23.5 million gallons of oil-fouled water so far, but officials say it’s impossible to 
know how much crude could have 
been skimmed in good weather be-cause of the fluctuating number of vessels and other variables.
The British company has now 
seen its costs from the spill reach $3.12 billion, a figure that doesn’t in-clude a $20 billion fund for damages the company created last month.
The storms have not affected 
drilling work on a relief well that BP says is the best chance for finally plugging the leak. The company ex-pects drilling to be finished by mid-August.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 6, 2010

system that meets its needs, he said.
UF’s programming team has found 
ways to replicate almost all of the features 
that WebCT offered, some by adding plug-ins. Sakai also offers new social-net-working features not included in WebCT, Zazueta said. For example, courses with Sakai can now include wikis, blogs and RSS feeds.
Professors switching their courses to 
Sakai have three options. 
First, they can completely re-create 
their classes in Sakai. Second, files can be moved over by support staff, but the pro-fessors have to set up the tools. Third, pro-fessors can allow UF’s tech staff to rebuild the course for them.“Some people will use Sakai at a very 
basic level, uploading a few files and syl-
labus and this type of thing,” Zazueta 
said. “Other people will make use of the 
full set of features of this system. As time goes by, people who feel more comfort-able with the system will use more of the 
new features.”
UF isn’t the only univer-
sity that had to find a new 
system after Blackboard an-nounced it would no longer 
support WebCT.
“There was a large community of Web-
CT users that will have to abandon that platform,” he said.
Zazueta said he does not expect UF 
to change systems again in the next 10 years.“You’re criminalizing behavior if it repre-
sents too large a portion of what you do, which is a bit odd.” 
According to an article in the Broward-
Palm Beach New Times, a class-action law-suit is underway challenging the law’s con-stitutionality. 
However, Rush said he thinks the law 
would be upheld because of legal prec-edents set by regulations of tobacco and alcohol products. 
In the unlikely event that Gainesville’s 
tobacco-related shops are affected, Justin and his friend John wouldn’t be out of op-tions. 
If necessary, Justin said, local bong and 
pipe users may travel to other cities in order 
to buy these kinds of things. 
Furthermore, those who want the ex-
perience of visiting a legitimate head shop 
could travel across state lines much like people who want to purchase 40-ounce bottles of beer already do. 
If the local shops were shut down or pe-
nalized, Justin said, an underground bong-artist market would emerge. 
People would simply go to bong makers 
in town and buy them directly, he said.TUESDAY, JULY 6, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 9

“Online gaming is definitely an extraor-
dinary thing,” he said. 
When he was in the hospital, he said he 
“welcomed any diversion … Video games provided that diversion.”
The full impact of the playroom wouldn’t 
be seen until the unit opened today, said Sinopoli, who now works with Shands. 
Tebow is expected to visit the facility 
before the Denver Broncos begin training 
camp at the end of the month, said Jennifer 
Russ, a Shands employee.
Another benefit of the playroom is that 
it gets patients moving, Anthony Tornese 
said.
Tornese received a bone marrow trans-
plant at Shands Children’s Hospital in late 
2003 when he was 13.  
He said that one of the problems he had 
as a patient was that doctors worried wa-ter would get in his lungs when he wasn’t moving.The new rooms, which have Nintendo 
Wiis installed in them, will encourage pa-tients to be active. Patients who receive bone marrow transplants stay at the hospi-
tal, on average, for 30 days.
Shands Children’s Hospital needs the 
support of organizations like The NASCAR

Nick Valvano, CEO of The V Foundation 
and brother to late college basketball coach Jimmy Valvano, said that people don’t re-alize how cancer affects families.

TEEING OFF WITH TOM GREEN UF FOOTBALL UF GYMNASTICSBy ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
Another school from Florida 
will kick off our list.
The University of Miami comes 
in at No. 10 in the alligatorSports’ 
preseason college football rank-ings.  
The Hurricanes are coming 
off a disappointing 9-4 season in which they started 5-1 with wins over then-ranked FSU, Georgia Tech and Oklahoma.
Coach Randy Shannon, who re-
ceived a new four-year contract in the offseason, has not won a bowl game in his three-year tenure with 
the Hurricanes.
But the expectations are high 
for Miami this season.
It returns quarterback Jacory 
Harris, who many believe will contend for the Heisman this year, 
along with the core of the receiv-ing corp. 
Senior Leonard Hankerson 
leads the group. Last season Han-kerson led the team in catches (45), receiving yards (801) and touch-downs (6). Juniors Aldarius John-son (276 receiving yards), Travis 
Benjamin (501) and LaRon Byrd 
(460) round out the receivers.
Miami is expected to use more 
of a west coast style offense this 
season to compensate for Harris’ 
arm. The coaches are implement-ing the new system in order to help limit Harris’ mistakes. He threw 17 interceptions last year, 
with most of them coming on deep passes.
But he should be receiving 
plenty of help in the form of a ground game.
With the departure of Javarris 
James and the knee injury to Graig Cooper, senior running back 
Damien Berry will get his chance.
Berry made the most of his 
opportunities last year as he av-eraged 6.6 yards per carry on 93 attempts. He is a physical back that often breaks the first tackle. This style should go a long way in helping offset Harris’ lack of mo-
bility and weak arm.
The biggest question mark of-
fensively will be Miami’s offen-sive line. It will need to make up 
for the loss of tackles Jason Fox and Matt Pipho, and center A.J. 
Trump.
The Hurricanes defense will be 
a little younger this season, too.
Their biggest loss will come 
in the graduation of middle line-
backer Darryl Sharpton. He led the squad with 106 tackles in his senior year before getting drafted in the fourth round of this year’s 
NFL draft by the Houston Texans.
Miami is expected to replace 
Sharpton with senior Colin Mc-
Carthy, who played outside line-
backer last season.
While Miami lost its leader 
in the middle of the defense, the 
secondary remains in tact for the most part.
All-Atlantic Coast Conference 
junior cornerback Brandon Har-ris is coming off of a year in which he led the team in passes broken 
up with 15. He also had two in-
terceptions and 58 tackles for the Hurricanes. He will team up in the secondary with senior DeMarcus Van Dyke to try to shut down the 
opposing receivers.
But Miami will have its hands 
full. Not only will it play a tough 
conference schedule, but the Hur-
ricanes will travel to Columbus, 
Ohio, to take on Ohio State on Sept. 11.
With the contract extension , 
Shannon will be expected to lead 
Miami to its first Atlantic Coast 
Conference title under his reign, and the BCS bowl berth that comes with it.

FOOTBALL
No. 10 Miami: Shannon looks to live up to expectationsEDITORIAL NOTEBOOK
Alligator Staff Writers
 
We here at the alligatorSports desk all 
know how much all of you, our loyal read-
ers, love your college football.
So, even though the 2010 season doesn’t 
kickoff (pun definitely intended) for another two months, the alligtorSports staff is here to give you your fix.
Five of our fantastic columnists, who are 
scattered coast-to-coast this summer, got together and submitted their votes for our 2010 alligatorSports College Football Pre-season Top 10.After spending a ludicrous amount of 
time calculating the votes with a complex formula that any middle school student could probably figure out, we managed to compile our top 10 teams heading into the 2010 college football season.
Starting today and continuing over the 
course of Summer B, we will count down the aforementioned teams one by one, unveiling one per issue.
Luckily for you all, there just so happen 
to be 10 more issues (including today’s) of the newspaper this summer.
That means that each day, we will be pre-
viewing a new team from our top 10, com-plete with a season outlook. 
Undoubtedly, all five polls used in our 
rankings are subjective, but that’s a good thing.
It means there was some variety in the 
polls, which we’re sure will provide for some lively debate – and inevitable chest-thumping when one of us is proven right as the season plays out.
Each of our columnists took several things 
into consideration when compiling the top 10 including how each team fared last season; who each team lost due to graduation, the NFL Draft, transfers and of course, dismiss-als from the team; and who the teams added in their recruiting classes that might impact the upcoming college football season.
While there was disagreement among us 
at the bottom part of our poll, we all agreed which team should be ranked No. 1 heading into the fall. Which team that is, you all will just have to wait and see.
We hope you enjoy this series and encour-
age you all to weigh in with your thoughts on our rankings. 
You could comment on the stories online 
at alligatorSports.org, e-mail us comments at sports@alligator.org or even hit us up on Twitter (@alligatorSports). Just remember to keep it clean. 
Preseason poll: The top 10 teams for 2010 season
� UF gymnast Marissa King, who 
earned four All-America honors as a freshman, won the silver medal on vault at the 2010 Women’s British Championships.� Linebacker A.J. Jones, who tore his ACL 
and MCL toward the end of last season, was cleared by his doctor to return to the team. Jones, a redshirt senior, has started 29 games during his time at Florida.� JaMarcus Russell, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, was arrested 
for possession of cough syrup with codeine, which is commonly found in the sub -
tance “purple drank.” I wonder if the arrest makes him eligible to sign with the Cincinnati Bengals. ... Colombian authorities seized a replica W orld Cup trophy 
made of 11 kilograms of cocaine. Finally, a World Cup that Colombia can win.18, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 6, 2010
July 1 was supposed to mark the begin-
ning of arguably the most anticipated summer the NBA had ever seen. 
It was supposed to denote the begin-
ning of the free agency period of some of the biggest and most influential names in the league – LeBron James, Dwyane Wade 
and Chris Bosh, to name a few.
This month was built up with the 
thoughts that where those superstars sign 
will establish the fate and direction the league takes for the next decade. It could 
determine a shift of power among teams 
and divisions.
July 1. The date loomed over the NBA 
news front for a couple of years like an 
ominous cloud. Really, the way it was 
talked up, you would think the Mayans had this summer marked on their calendar as the end of times.
It was supposed to be the Summer of 
2010, but less than a week into July it has quickly turned into the Summer of Misin-formation – due in large part to the cover-age provided by ESPN.
The Worldwide Leader in Sports, as it is 
so affectionately known, has been waiting for this summer with as much anticipation as fans in Cleveland, New York, Miami and Chicago.
This summer was supposed to be the 
network’s time to shine; to blow the cover-
age of this free agency period out of the 
water – after all, ESPN probably has more resources at its disposal than any other sports media outlet out there.
But no, what was supposed to be a 
golden opportunity for ESPN as a media outlet was botched in the first couple of days of the free agency period.
From a journalistic view, it seems ESPN 
is focused on being the first to report things, but with that mindset, accuracy is often compromised.
The weekend before the free agency 
period began, ESPN reported that Wade, James and Bosh had a free agent summit in Miami discussing the possibility of all three coming together to play for the Heat. No more than a day later did The Miami 
Herald debunk that report with proof that 
all three weren’t even in Miami that week-end.
One of the finer examples of sacrificing 
accuracy for being first was when Chad Ford first reported that Wade was meeting with the Chicago Bulls for a second time, at the player’s request.Ford, at the 
time of the report, said Wade was 
leaning toward 
signing with his hometown Bulls.
Multiple other 
media outlets reported that Wade’s second 
meeting with the Bulls was at the team’s request and that Wade met the request as 
a courtesy, because apparently he’s not the 
type of businessman to turn down a face-to-face.
In an attempt to be the first to report the 
meeting, Ford – and ESPN – through their multiple anonymous sources, failed to ac-curately report the news, if you even want to call the meeting news, and sent Miami Heat fans everywhere into a full-on panic.
Aside from having reports contradict 
those of the local beat writers for some of the teams, ESPN’s coverage has made dra-ma where there isn’t drama, and catered 
to its viewers in major markets like New 
York and Chicago all for the sake of rat-ings.
One minute, the network gives off the impression that LeBron is set to join the Knicks, marching out ESPN’s resident “ca-pologist” to explain how adding LeBron 
plus another free agent would work for 
New York. 
The next minute, Wade, Bosh and LeB-
ron are all but guaranteed to play together 
in Chicago – this time, conveniently, with-
out prancing out that same salary cap ex-pert to explain the logistics of the Bulls making room for all three.
But at the end of the day, all of these 
anonymous sources and breaking reports mean nothing until those players sign on the dotted line sometime after the clock strikes 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
For ESPN, a summer that should have 
showed why it is the Worldwide Leader in Sports has instead shown that the network cares about more than being a premier me-dia outlet. 
It has shown that ratings and being first 
can trump accuracy and reporting of ac-tual news.
I for one can’t wait for free agency to be 
over with so we can move on to the next big thing that ESPN will misinform us on, which will probably be another Brett Favre retirement saga.

MIAMI — Heat fans missed a chance to 
make their case to Dwyane Wade on Mon-
day.
No big deal. Micky Arison did it for them.
As Wade moved closer to deciding his fu-
ture, he returned to Miami and was seen enter-
ing the team’s arena with team owner Arison, who wants to pay the six-time All-Star around $127 million for the next six seasons. The day started with a glitch — fans were told to show up at the wrong part of Miami’s airport to greet Wade — but Heat officials remained op-timistic their star player isn’t going anywhere.
For his part, Wade was still contemplating his future.
“Not there yet,” Wade’s agent, Henry 
Thomas, said Monday.
Thomas represents Wade and Chris Bosh, 
two-thirds of the triumvirate that’s driving this unprecedented free-agent period, along with two-time MVP LeBron James.
There’s speculation that the megastars will 
announce their decisions soon, especially after all three spent the latter part of last week hear-
ing sales pitches from plenty of clubs.
Wade said last week that the decision 
wouldn’t be simple, a stance Thomas reiter-
ated on both his and Bosh’s behalf Monday.
“They want to feel like they have evaluated 
everything about each situation,” Thomas wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press. 
“It is fair to say, that the decision for both has 
been harder than either imagined.”
For fans, just seeing Wade on Monday was 
harder than they imagined.
The word went out early in the morning. 
Show up at 8 a.m. and welcome Wade back to South Florida, fans were told.
So they did.Right time. Wrong location.
Instead of flying on a private jet, Wade took 
a commercial flight from Charleston, S.C., into 
one of Miami International Airport’s main terminals. So about 50 Heat fans, as well as a handful of team employees, left without a glimpse of Wade.“He’ll hear that we were here,” said 
20-year-old fan David Figueroa. “That’s enough, right?”
Wade’s representatives confirmed that the 
28-year-old guard was aware of the gathering, albeit after he left the airport.
The Heat utilized Facebook and Twitter 
around 12:50 a.m. Monday to rally fans. Buzz grew quickly, and some fans were in place — the wrong place, unknowingly — by 7 a.m. 
An employee at the Signature Air facility at 
the airport said staff typically is told when a high-profile person like Wade is arriving, and that transportation for him is usually arranged ahead of time.
That wasn’t the case Monday. And by the 
time word arrived that Wade was back in Mi-ami, he’d already left the airport.
“Bad information,” Heat executive vice 
president and chief marketing officer Michael McCullough apologetically told the sign-wav-ing group.
Wade is scheduled to appear at a youth bas-
ketball camp about 30 minutes north of Miami on Tuesday, plus take questions with Alonzo Mourning about their charity weekend later this month. Hundreds of well-wishers are expected there, including dozens of children 
who are working on a “special” presentation 
for the 2006 NBA finals MVP.
Many of those well-wishers will be Heat 
employees. The organization chartered four buses to take about 200 staffers to a surprise birthday party for free agent Udonis Haslem last month, and will take a similar approach with Wade’s event on Tuesday.
Before arriving Monday — in Miami-Wade 
County, officially, until July 8 by order of the county commissioners — Wade had been in Chicago for the first rounds of meetings in free-agent mania. He had formal sit-downs with the New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets and the Chicago Bulls (twice), plus an infor-mal chat with the Heat.
Although Wade often has said he would 
like to remain in Miami, provided the team’s 
roster is upgraded to his liking, tension is 
clearly high around 601 Biscayne Blvd., the Heat’s home address.
Forget June 20, 2006, the day Miami won 
its NBA title, as the defining day for the fran-chise.
No, July 8, 2010 — the first day of this free-
agent signing period — could be the day that shapes the Heat for years to come.
“We love him,” McCullough said. “We’re 
not the only ones, and we hope that he comes back.TUESDAY, JULY 6, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 19

� EVANS WILL GET A SEVER -
ANCE PACKAGE FROM UGA
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
ATHENS, Ga. — Damon Evans 
offered another apology on the day 
his resignation as Georgia’s ath-letic director was announced by the 
school’s president.
The announcement by Michael 
Adams came after a conference call 
with the executive committee of the athletic association’s board of direc-tors Monday. Adams said Evans resigned Sunday, less than a week after Evans was arrested on a DUI charge.
Evans released a statement Mon-
day in which he offered “my sin-cerest apology” to Adams, Georgia officials, coaches, fans and student-athletes.
Evans was 34 when he was cho-
sen athletic director in 2004.“It had been my hope since tak-
ing the job in 2004 that I would have a long career at UGA,” Evans said. “But because of a serious mistake in judgment, that won’t be the case and 
I understand that I have a long road 
to rebuilding my reputation and ca-reer.”
Adams read a statement and said 
he will have no other comment until Tuesday.
Evans was arrested late Wednes-
day in Atlanta. He was charged with DUI and failure to maintain a lane. 
Also arrested with him was Court-
ney Fuhrmann, who was charged with disorderly conduct.
Evans said Thursday Fuhrmann 
is “just a friend.” According to the incident report, the arresting officer said Fuhrmann told him she had been seeing Evans for “only a week or so.”
Evans and his wife, Kerri, have 
two children. He apologized to his wife Thursday as she attended his news conference.
Evans became the Southeastern 
Conference’s first black athletic di-rector in 2004.
There was no immediate word 
on a replacement.
Adams said Evans, whose raise 
to a $550,000 annual salary took ef-fect at about the same time as his ar-rest, will be paid three months salary as severance. Evans also will receive 
$100,000 he has earned as a longev-
ity bonus.
“We acknowledge the many pos-
itive accomplishments of his tenure, 
including an increased focus on the academic success of student-ath-letes, the overall financial strength of the athletic department and the hiring of many very good people as head coaches and senior leaders 
in the athletic department,” Adams 
said, reading from a statement.
Despite those accomplishments, Evans’ arrest caused damage to his reputation that led to the resigna-tion.
“As I said on Thursday morning, 
when I first learned of the situation, 
this is not an example of the kind of 
leadership that I expect our senior administrators to set,” Adams said. “I have high regard for Damon per-sonally; I care deeply about him and his family.”
Adams chose Evans as AD af-
ter the president refused to extend Vince Dooley’s contract.
Possible candidates to replace 
Evans from the Georgia staff include associate ADs Frank Crumley, Ar-thur Johnson and Claude Felton and senior associate AD Carla Williams.
At his news conference Thurs-
day, Evans said he “failed miser-ably” as a leader and representative of Georgia.
At that time, Evans said he 
hoped to save his job. Details from the Georgia State Patrol’s incident report from the arrest added even more embarrassment.
According to the report, Evans 
attempted to influence the arresting officer, identified in the report as M. 
Cabe, by telling the officer he was 
Georgia’s athletic director.
According to the report, Evans 
said: “I am not trying to bribe you, but is there anything you can do without arresting me?”
Cabe said that Evans asked to be 
taken to a motel instead of jail or to be let off with a warning.
The officer noted that Evans was 
found with a “red pair of lady’s panties between his legs.”
Evans was the public face of the 
school’s athletic department in many venues, including at home football games at Sanford Stadium. Before each game, his taped video message was played as he urged fans not to 
drink and drive.
“If you drink and drive, you 
lose,” Evans said in the video.

NEW YORK — From Cleveland to Chicago, South Florida 
to the New York area, it was a mostly quiet Fourth of July in 
the NBA.
The real fireworks will apparently start this week.
With LeBron James and other big names taking time to pon-
der their futures, the free-agent market was in many ways on 
hold for the holiday — though Joe Johnson did agree to a maxi-mum contract to stay in Atlanta.
Once the others reach their conclusions, things will start to heat up again.
“I’m sure everyone is ready to get a decision going,” Dwya-
ne Wade told Chicago’s NBC-Channel 5.
Wade said he planned to use the weekend to think af-
ter meeting twice with the Bulls, plus getting visits from the Knicks and Nets. Wade arrived back in Miami early Monday morning and met with owner Micky Arison at the America-nAirlines Arena sometime Monday.  He is expected to head-line a basketball camp in South Florida starting today as well, plus meet with Heat president Pat Riley at some point in the 
coming days.James was expected to spend the holiday relaxing at his 
Bath, Ohio, home with family and friends. It was a chance to 
catch his breath after a whirlwind three days during which six teams gave him reasons why he should continue his career wearing a new No. 6 jersey in their colors.
The Knicks talked to representatives for James for the sec-
ond time on Saturday in Ohio, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke Sunday night on condi-tion of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Se-nior vice president Glen Grunwald and MSG Sports president 
Scott O’Neil represented the team, and James did not attend 
the chat.
Knicks president Donnie Walsh told ESPN.com the team 
wanted to provide more information about the franchise’s sal-ary-cap situation for this year and 2011.
Messages were left seeking comment from James’ agent, 
Leon Rose, and his manager, Maverick Carter.
Beyond his decision, James has a busy week ahead. He is 
hosting a Nike camp at the University of Akron, where he re-
cently accepted his second straight MVP award and was hon-
ored by the city with a day of appreciation in an outdoor event at the school’s football stadium.
It’s possible James could announce his decision in his home-
town during or following the camp, which will feature some of the nation’s top high school players.
Besides the Cavs, the other teams anticipating word from 
James are Chicago, Miami, New Jersey, New York and the Los Angeles Clippers. Some of them spent the past two seasons 
clearing around $30 million of salary cap space so they could 
afford to sign James and another marquee free agent.
Now they’re asking him to walk away from $30 million, 
roughly the difference between a six-year deal to stay in Cleve-land and the five-year contract the competitors can offer him under the collective bargaining agreement.
The teams aren’t the only ones waiting.Players such as Amar’e Stoudemire and Carlos Boozer, who 
in some years might be the best free agents available, are in a 
holding pattern while James, Wade and Chris Bosh, considered 
the head of the class, come to their decisions.
“My guys are simply taking a step back and evaluating all 
of the info that they received over the past few days,” Henry Thomas, the agent for Wade and Bosh, wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press.
Stoudemire arrived in New York on Saturday and met with 
the Knicks on Monday. During the Monday meeting, the two sides reached an agreement in principle for Stoudemire to sign 
a five-year deal worth about $100 million. 
There has been some action since this highly awaited free 
agency period opened on Thursday. Paul Pierce and Dirk Now-
itzki are staying right where they were expected to, agreeing to multiyear deals to remain in Boston and Dallas, respectively.
But the focus remains on the guys who haven’t signed — 
just as it’s been for nearly four years. 
James, Wade and Bosh designed contracts in 2006 that gave 
them the option to become free agents this summer, creating 
more hype for their courtship than some real sporting events 
could ever dream of.
After all that buildup, the end is finally in sight.20, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 6, 2010
