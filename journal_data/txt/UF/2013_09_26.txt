� POLICE TOOK FOUR 
SWORDS AND SEVERAL KNIVES FROM HIM.

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested Tuesday after threaten-
ing a lawn crew and an ofﬁ  cer with a samurai sword.
Rishiraj Rajan Job, 34, was 
drinking inside his apartment in the 4200 block of Southwest 22nd Lane while the crew worked in his yard, accord-ing to a GPD report released Wednesday.
Job walked out the front 
door yelling and wielding a samurai sword like a baseball bat at shoulder height. When he approached the two work-ers, Placido Espinosa-Rangel and Arago Leroyj Welch, they dropped their equipment and ran away from the area, accord-ing to the report.
When police arrived, Job 
had gone back inside his apart-ment. He answered the door holding the sword over his shoulder, and, according to the report, he yelled, “Come get me!” The ofﬁ  cer pointed a gun at him and ordered him to drop the sword.
Job was arrested at about 
2:30 p.m. and charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill. He was booked into the Alachua County Jail, where he remained as of press time with bond set at $50,000.
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben 
Tobias wrote in an email that it appeared Job had been drink-ing beer and using synthetic cannabis.
Job had four samurai swords 
and several large knives, Tobias wrote, which were taken as pre-caution with Job’s consent.Man threatens with

The Turlington Dancer, once known for 
his messages of peace and love, is wearing the 
same booty shorts but rocking a new attitude.
Dennis Kane was trespassed from UF cam-
pus in August 2012. Roughly a year later, he has taken the corner of Buckman Drive and West University Avenue as one of his spots to preach to students about the dangers of be-ing too attached to their cellphones and acting “too cool for everybody else.”
UF students have said they heard Kane 
shout things like “No one will ever love you,” “You’re worthless,” and “You know the world is f***ed up when women are in positions of power.”
According to an email from University Po-
lice spokesman Maj. Brad Barber, Kane would be arrested after a warning if he were to step foot back on campus.
Thirty-eight-year-old Kane said his focus has become computer programming. His rants on the maladjustments of today’s youth are frequently punctuated by calls of “programmers needed.” His website, www.whyirule.com, explains his creation of an operating system inside a Web browser will “change the world as we know it.”
“The reason I can be this crazy is because 
I’ve got the proof to back it up,” Kane said.
He said he refrains from singling people 
out on the street when he’s in a “passionate” mood, though he admits he occasionally tar-gets “Greek-type people” for their attitudes.
He said he’s been annoyed and angry with 
people, which is why he’s been dancing with his sign adorned with his website’s URL.

� LOCALS SAY THE NEW LAW COULD HELP.
NIKO PIFFERETTI
Alligator Staff Writer npifferetti@alligator.org
For many entrepreneurs, persuading investors to fund 
startup companies has always been a struggle, but a federal 
law that took effect Monday and that’s expected to impact Gainesville, may make it easier.
The law, Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups 
Act of 2012 (JOBS), amends a law from 1933 that made it ille-gal for companies to use mass communication to solicit po-tential investors, said Tanya Prive, a contributor to Forbes.
Now, companies can put out print media and TV adver-
tisements, and even post on social media to spread the word that they’re looking for investors.“It is true that you can go ahead and tweet that you are 
fundraising and take an ad out on TV… but what comes with the privilege is additional responsibility that startups need to ensure that they fulﬁ  ll,” Prive said in a phone inter-view.
Even though the asking is easier now, the law restricts 
whom startups can take investments from.Startups can now solicit investments with some restrictionsSEE DANCER, PAGE 4

Startups can only accept mon-
ey from individuals who meet 
minimum annual-income require-ments or have at least $1 million in assets, Prive said.
The transactions must be re-
corded and submitted on federal documents, or a startup can be deemed a “bad actor.”  As a con-sequence, the entrepreneur would not be allowed to fundraise for a year.
“For a startup, that actually 
could mean death,” Prive said.
Some local entrepreneurs ex-
pect the law will have a positive impact on Gainesville.
“With an increased opportuni-
ty to reach out to capital investors, our local startups will have a bet-ter chance at securing investment,” said Adrian Taylor, the vice presi-dent of Innovation Gainesville.
Anjali Kundra, a UF alumna 
and one of four people who rep-resented Gainesville at a global entrepreneur congress in March, cautioned that the JOBS Act isn’t the entire solution to the time-con-suming task of gathering enough cash to get off the ground.
“A lot of companies here think 
that funding is the turnkey of success, but that’s not always the case,” Kundra said, instead urging entrepreneurs to self-fund projects ﬁ  rst.
Julian Miller, a fellow UF alum-
nus who joined Kundra at the con-gress, said the law will encourage more people to give entrepreneur-ship a shot — even if the race to solicit funds is chaotic at ﬁ  rst.
“It’s probably going to blow 
up and be really ugly for a while, but once it stabilizes, there will be power to create jobs where there were none,” he said.
Jane Muir, director of the UF 
Florida Innovation Hub, said she hopes the new law helps startups get through “the valley of death” faster, but the actual effects are yet to be seen.
“I think the intention is good,” 
she said. “I’m going to be interest-ed to see what impact it will really have.”Valeria Yulee, a 20-year-old public relations ju-
nior, said she sees Kane around Midtown.
“He’s deﬁ  nitely eccentric and a little out there,” 
she said. “He stands out with his booty shorts and 
really deep V-neck.”
Miguel Matos, a 20-year-old UF sophomore studying Japanese, said Kane isn’t causing too much of a problem.
Kane, who said he dropped out of UF in 1995, 
said students were different and friendlier when he attended. Now, the only looks he gets are mocking ones.
“I’m alone here,” he said. “I’m alone in this 
world, and I’ve got nobody on my side.”

When Chrissy McLarty gets 
ready for a job interview, she makes 
sure she has a professional outﬁ  t, her resume — and her mom.
According to the Wall Street 
Journal, a new trend has been catch-ing on among millennials where they seek to keep their parents as involved as possible in the job pro-cess, even bringing them into their interviews.
The 22-year-old UF alumna has 
been on the job hunt, and her moth-er is never far behind.
“I’ve been to three of them now 
where we go to the interviews on Friday, and then we’ll make a little weekend of it in whatever city,” she said.
McLarty said her mother calls 
herself McLarty’s “little entourage” because she helps her do her hair and makeup in preparation for the interview.
“It helps with the traveling,” 
she said. ‘I don’t have to make the big decisions, so I’m oriented and focused on what needs to be done, which is getting the job.”
But McLarty isn’t the only Gator 
who has parents involved in her career, said Bianka Valbrun, an 18-year-old business administration sophomore and employee at the Ca-reer Resource Center. She said she’s had about ﬁ  ve parents call her this semester looking for resources for their children.
“A lot of the time, I’ve had par-
ents say that their kids are lazy, so they called for them,” Valbrun said.
Ellen Aschenbrener, manager of 
How Do You Roll? sushi, said in her 20 years of interviewing, she’s never seen a candidate bring their parents.
“A grown person has no reason 
to be bringing in their parents,” she said.Megan Buttell, a 23-year-old UF 
ﬁ  nance and management gradu-ate student, said she’s heard from several employers that one of their greatest turnoffs is when a candi-date brings in his or her parents.
She said it’s unprofessional and 
displays immaturity from the ap-plicant.
“It’s your career, your job. You’re 
a big kid,” Buttell said. “You’re sup-posed to be able to handle this your-self.”

at the driving range of UF’s Mark Bostick Golf Course on Wednesday.
� IT’S MADE TOP 20 FOR FOUR YEARS. 
REGINA SIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF’s Mark Bostick Golf Course was recently 
ranked by Golfweek magazine as the 20th best 
campus golf course among others nationally.
The 6,700 yard, par-70 course has placed in 
the top 20 for the past four years. 
Scott Hampton, the course’s director of golf, 
said he thinks the success of the course is due to its challenging holes, consistent maintenance and $4 million 2001 face-lift, which included re-designed holes and new putting greens.
“The renovations contribute to the success, as it helped upgrade the course to the standards it needed to be — making it a difficult golf course and challenging for the teams,” Hampton said.
The semiprivate course supports the univer-
sity’s Division I men’s and women’s golf teams. It hosts daily practices, collegiate events, yearly fundraisers, cross-country races and high school events.
Michael Bobbitt, an assistant golf coach at P.K. 
Yonge High School, said the ranking reflects the course’s improvements.
“It’s amazing how the course takes time to 
host the men and women’s Gator golf teams, alumni and students while giving us the space to have our high school matches here as well,” Bobbitt said. “They are running a great organiza-tion here.”UF’s golf course is 20th best

UF is encouraging students to 
burn through the pages of banned 
books.
In honor of Banned Book Week, 
Virtual Readout will celebrate the freedom to read today on the Plaza of the Americas.
The week’s festivities showcase 
books that have been previously banned or challenged in schools and libraries.
Smathers Library is hosting the 
readout for the first time, giving students the chance to choose their favorite previously banned book and read an excerpt aloud.
The event will be held from 11 
a.m. to 1 p.m. and will feature free pizza.
The library will videotape the 
readout, and Michelle LeSure, a li-brary associate at Library West, will compose a three-minute video.
The video will then be uploaded 
to the American Library Associa-tion’s YouTube channel.
“Hopefully, people will express 
why the book is important and how they feel about censorship in litera-ture,” she said.
Barbara Hood, the director 
of communications at George A. Smathers Libraries, said banned books are often those that individu-als consider their favorite works of literature.
LeSure organized the Banned 
Book Week Virtual Readout. She said that up until recently, the li-brary only presented displays about Banned Book Week.
“I have always been a champion 
against censorship,” LeSure said. “I am trying to raise awareness that this is part of our society.”Readout to fire students

Dennis Kane) yelled at you?Cruz-in’ for bruisin’: 
Even Republicans are 
sick of the senator
Much like a ﬁ  rst-year college student, freshman Re-
publican Sen. Ted Cruz tries too hard, talks too much and is hated by upperclassmen.
On Wednesday, John McCain criticized Cruz’s dogged ef-
forts to ﬁ  libuster a bill that would stop funding for health care reform implementation — even though he and other Repub-licans pushed the House to pass a bill that would defund the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.
According to a transcription on MSNBC’s Rachel Mad-
dow’s blog, McCain said, “In the 2012 election, ‘Obamacare,’ as it’s called . . . was a subject that was a major issue in the campaign. I campaigned all over America for two months, everywhere I could, and in every single campaign rally I said, ‘And we have to repeal and replace Obamacare.’”
“Well, the people spoke,” he said. “They spoke, much to 
my dismay, but they spoke and they re-elected the president of the United States.”
McCain’s argument — that the majority of American peo-
ple have decided that Obamacare is a worthwhile endeavor — differs from many other conservatives’ arguments. As the House begins voting on government funding, a number of voices has contributed to the anti-Cruz conversation.
Many conservatives point to the obvious: Cruz is a moron, 
and his attempt to stop a bill that his own party supports is counterproductive. On Tuesday, he took to the Senate ﬂ  oor and said he’d speak as long as he could stand, even if that would lead to a government shutdown — which would hurt the GOP.
Dave Freddoso, a reporter for Conservative Intelligence 
Brieﬁ  ng, published an analysis Sunday of Cruz’s ﬂ  awed health care act defunding plan. Cruz said the GOP must vote to fund the government incrementally, focusing on the mili-tary and “simply omit funding for Obamacare,” Freddoso said.
“Unfortunately, he’s glossing over a major technical detail 
that sinks the whole thing: The funding for Obamacare does not depend on the government spending bill (the ‘continuing resolution’) that Cruz has now announced he will block from getting a vote on the Senate ﬂ  oor,” Freddoso wrote. “Obama-care gets funded whether that bill passes or not. So there’s no such thing as funding the rest of the government and ‘leaving out’ funding for Obamacare.”
And what Cruz is doing isn’t even a ﬁ  libuster, according 
to The Atlantic. Twitter dubbed it a “fauxlibuster” because the vote to move forward with government-funding legisla-tion began Wednesday, regardless of Cruz’s performance.
Just like a college freshman who took a few too many bong 
rips at a frat party, Cruz can’t stop running his mouth about his misguided and uninformed political beliefs. As voting for government-funding legislation began this week, at least Democrats and Republicans can agree on one thing: Cruz needs to just shut up.
Obama: Stop using violent drone strikes
Headlines abound with the humanitarian crisis in 
Syria, with our very own president at the fore-front of denouncing the apparent human rights 
violations in the region.
There are no headlines for the minimum of 400 civil-
ians, including about 200 children, killed in Pakistan alone by drones.
President Barack Obama is quick to decry others when 
they do wrong, but when it comes to him, there’s no wrongdoing under the guise of “national security.”
We’ve killed U.S. citizens. We’ve killed children. But 
how many, exactly? It’s impossible to tell. 
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which has done 
an excellent job of reporting on the drone war, doesn’t even know. There is little transparency surrounding the murder of civilians.
In a democracy, transparency is critical for the elector-
ate to make educated decisions when electing its leaders. But the Obama administration does everything not to be clear, including classifying any military-age male in a strike zone as an enemy combatant. That takes a lot of ci-vilian casualties off the books.
There are arguments for the drone war, sure. The one 
I’ve heard most is that it’s safer. Safer for whom?
The U.S. conducts signature drone strikes in Pakistan, 
which means that if someone is suspected of being an en-emy, he can be killed strictly based on his behavior. Presi-dent Obama doesn’t have to know his name. But if he’s of military age, no worries — it’s written off as another militant killed, even if he was innocent.
Missiles are hardly precision weapons, and the strikes 
often kill civilians. Not only that, but the drone strikes — run by the CIA — use double-tap strikes. A second mis-sile is ﬁ  red moments after the ﬁ  rst, intended to kill ﬁ  rst responders to the carnage — an act labeled as a “possible war crime” by two U.N. investigators.
While drone operators may be physically safe from the dangers of combat, they are not mentally safe. 
Researchers with the De-
partment of Defense found that drone pilots have the same rates of mental illnesses — such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression — as pilots of manned aircrafts.
It makes sense: Drone pilots have a uniquely taxing job. 
They have to stare at the same piece of ground for hours at a time, looking at destruction they’ve caused. At the end of their shift, they go home and eat dinner with their fami-lies. Instead of being in the standard soldier environment — where one is deployed to ﬁ  ght and come back to civil-ian life — they live life at war.
The millions of dollars spent on predator drones and 
tens of thousands spent on the Hellﬁ  re missiles they ﬁ  re beg the question — what good could that money be used for back home rather than the killing of innocent people?
The drone war illustrates another reason militants 
abroad can convert more people to radical ideology. I would, for example, want to retaliate against whoever killed my brother with a remote controlled plane I could neither see nor hear.
The solution is simple: Limit drone use as much as pos-
sible, and, when it’s necessary, be completely transparent about it.
Transparency would ensure no questions of who was 
killed or why.  There would be clear reasons for taking out targets rather than relying on signature strikes, allow-ing for less civilian casualties. If the U.S. is forthcoming about their motivations when ordering strikes, extrem-ism would decrease — populations would know a foreign government wasn’t ﬁ  ring indiscriminately at them.

Last week I lived every ‘90s girl’s (and 
some boys’) dream when I got to interview 
Justin Timberlake and Anthony Mackie about upcoming movie “Runner Runner.”
The based-on-true-events movie, which 
premieres Oct. 4, follows Princeton University college student Richie Furst (Justin Timber-lake) through Costa Rica to confront the head of an online gambling site that lost him his tuition money. There he is convinced to join Ivan Block (Ben Afﬂ  eck) in his online gam-bling business and is tracked down by FBI Agent Shavers (Anthony Mackie), who hopes to bring Block down.
I’d been waiting all my life for this moment. 
Just kidding. 
Although, I did devote the day to the in-
terview because in the excitement of it all, I missed the part of the directions that told me to sign on to Google Hangouts at 11:50 a.m. PST, so I was three hours early. 
When all eight of the college journalists 
participating in the interview were online, it took the moderator about an hour to check the sound, explain the directions and give us the two-minute warning.
Fifteen minutes after the two-minute warn-
ing, the actors stepped on camera, and the expression on everyone’s face went from an-noyed to toothy grin.
If the way the group interview played out 
is any indication of what the audience should expect from “Runner Runner,” it’s safe to say the movie will be a sassy crowd pleaser with some lighthearted twists.
From the moment Timberlake and Mackie 
joined the Hangout, the pair started joking with everyone.
The bad Internet connection messed up the 
predetermined order in which the journalists could ask their questions.
Between broken sentences, I heard the pair 
say the girl wearing red lipstick looked like she had something to say.
I had just made the realization I was the 
only girl in red lipstick on the Hangout that afternoon when I heard a “Ma-jore-ee” come from the speaker. I internalized my natural fangirling and got professional.
“Marjorie,” I said. “Hey, how are you 
guys?”
They said they were good and asked me 
where I was. I told them I was in Gainesville, interviewing them for the Avenue.
“So, you’re a Gator,” Mackie said and asked 
if I was going to do the Gator Chomp.
Of course, I did the Gator Chomp, and so 
did they. That led me right into my ﬁ  rst ques-tion.
Q: Justin, growing up in the entertainment 
business, you didn’t have the traditional col-lege experience. How did you prepare to play a college student in “Runner Runner”?  
The Internet connection slowed again and they replied by requesting I ask my question again.
The pair teased me about my wood-pan-
eled ofﬁ  ce and said the Internet connection must be so bad because clearly, I was inter-viewing them from the ’70s.
After nervously laughing, I asked a less 
concise version of the same question.
Mackie made jokes about beer pong and 
ﬂ  ip cup, and Timberlake addressed the ques-tion more seriously.
JT: For the most part, I didn’t know much 
about online gambling because I’m not a big “online gamer” in any way. I actually have a really good friend who used to be an online poker player and an online gamer, so he kind of showed me the ropes around what that is … I guess I can say I drank a lot of beer, a lot of pub crawls.
They thanked me for my question and 
moved onto the others.
Q: Justin, you play a character that’s in the 
middle of this whole thing where everyone is against you. What’s it like to get into that char-acter?JT: I ﬁ  nd that regardless of the relationship 
the characters have in the movie, I think the more fun you have with the actors and the more collaborative the experience is, and in a way the closer you get with the actors, that it’s easier to play any type of relationship… He (Mackie) basically terrorizes me the whole movie. But off-camera, it was an opportunity for us to immediately jump in and start dis-secting material. I think the more fun you have together, the more comfortable you feel play-ing a guy, or guys, that are on opposite ends of the spectrum.
Q: Brad Furman’s last ﬁ  lm “The Lincoln 
Lawyer” was a lot about the legal world, with playful entertaining tones. Does “Runner Run-ner” follow the same style?
AM: I think if you look at Brad’s other 
movie, he really has a interesting way of look-ing at the world. I think it shows in his movies with the way he shoots. With this movie, it’s so bright and beautiful, you really give your character the opportunity to go as far as they can into the world they live in without becom-ing superﬁ  cial or unbelievable.
Q: What about your character attracted 
you to the roles?
JT: I loved the idea of Richie, this charac-
ter who’s a good guy. He’s trying to do the right thing, but he’s got himself into a hole. It’s kind of the idea of trying to dig yourself out of a hole, but you just keep digging yourself deeper and deeper into that hole. You know, I identify with a lot of things about him.
AM: For me, it was more so I enjoyed the 
ability to really just push Justin around. My character is such a bully in this movie, and I’m never given the opportunity to grow out my facial hair and look crazy and sweaty and smack up white dudes. So when I’m given that opportunity, I go for that 100 percent.
The bad Internet connection made the 
question-and-answer session run less smooth-ly than it could have, but between the jokes and insight to “Runner Runner,” I sure was glad to have participated. 
You can catch the movie in theaters on Oct. 
4, and you can read the rest of the interview 
questions online at alligator.org/the_avenue.

Is it just me or were the Emmys 
just … OK? Don’t get me wrong, 
I love the bits of comedy thrown in there (I love you, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler), but the big, expected showstopping number from host Neil Patrick Harris didn’t even hap-pen until 90 minutes in. Sure, we got some awkwardly awesome walk-dancing from “Castle” star Nathan Fillion, but … the pizzazz just didn’t seem to be there. Here are some highlights anyway:Tina Fey and Amy Poehler for 
Queens of the Universe.
As if we couldn’t love them 
more, the Fey-Poehler dynamic duo stole the evening early on. From heckling the host from their seats (Poehler on seeing NPH twerk: “It might be degrading, but we would be de-grateful”) to Fey’s win for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, the pair should literally just host every award show ever. I mean, all of them.
Surprise snubs & “Wait, HE 
won?!”“Veep” cast 
members Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Tony Hale won Outstanding Lead Actress and  Supporting Actor in a Comedy Se-
ries, respectively, beating out front-runners from “Modern Family.” Jeff Daniels won for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series over “Break-ing Bad” star Bryan Cranston, and “Nurse Jackie” actress Merritt Wev-er — who had the shortest, best ac-ceptance speech ever — surprised in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy category over “Modern Family” beauty Soﬁ  a Vergara. Any-one else lose their Emmys prediction pool horribly, or … In memoriam, in between
Speakers including Rob Reiner, 
Jane Lynch and Edie Falco paid trib-ute to Jean Stapleton, Cory Monteith and James Gandolﬁ  ni in personal-ized memorials spaced out random-ly during the telecast. 
Each of them was touching in 
their own way and very special — a nice (but incredibly depressing) way to pay tribute to some of television’s most well-loved ﬁ  gures.
Guys, I’m pretty sure #WeirdEm-
mys is trending
Uh, lots of weird things went 
down. Carrie Underwood sang the Beatles’ “Yesterday” in…some sort of tribute to television. That was weird. Michael Douglas asked Matt Damon if he wanted “the bottom or the top” of his Emmy for Outstand-ing Lead Actor in a Miniseries. That was weird.

He might win gold medals, but Ryan 
Lochte can’t win viewers.
After one season of low ratings, E! 
Entertainment decided not to sign on to 
another season of Lochte’s reality show, “What Would Ryan Lochte Do?”
Lochte’s show lacked certain elements 
that make reality shows succeed, accord-ing to Jessica Mahone, an adjunct lecturer in the UF Department of Telecommunica-tion.
“There has to be an element of drama,” 
Mahone said, “and I don’t think there was any drama in the Ryan Lochte show.”
According to USA Today, the season ﬁ  -
nale had about 300,000 viewers. The show followed the UF alumnus and Olympic gold medalist around in his daily life. Episodes showed Lochte at Midtown hot spots like 101 Cantina and Balls as he used his signature catchphrase “jeah.”
“It was more like 
‘let’s follow Ryan Lochte around and see 
what dumb things he says,’” said Mahone.
Elisabeth Crane 
admits to watching a few episodes of the show.
The  20-year-old 
UF criminology and law sophomore tuned into a couple of episodes but found the show pointless.
“Gold medals can only get you so far,” 
she said. “I’d be more interested in Mi-chael Phelps.” 
Lochte could not be reached for com-
ment.WWRLD? No one caresJeah!

Major: Food science and human nutrition, dieteticsYear: JuniorHometown: Fort Myers, Fla.Fun Fact: I love any-thing pumpkin ﬂ  avored!1. How did you get interested in health/ﬁ  tness lifestyle? My mom has always been into living a healthy lifestyle, but I would eat none of it. However, when I became a competitive runner in high school, I wanted to make sure I was eating in a way that would make me the best athlete, so I became passionate about making foods that were still just as delicious, yet healthy, too!
2. Fifty-four thousand followers! WOW! How and when did you integrate social media/blog/website?
This past Spring, I decided to make an Instagram account for my food just for fun. I was spending a lot of time in the kitchen with the extra time that I wasn’t competitively running for UF anymore, and I decided to follow my passion of healthy cooking with it. From there, I decided to also create a blog a couple months later.
3. Is it difﬁ  cult to keep up with?
It is deﬁ  nitely more challenging now that I’m back up at college, but you can always make time for what is important to you, and this is a huge passion of mine. It certainly is like having a second job, but it’s what I love to do.
4. What is your favorite part about helping others lead healthier lives with your tips and recipes? 
At ﬁ  rst, I didn’t know if I was truly affecting others’ lives or not, but soon after creating an email account for Fresh Fit N Healthy, I began receiving the most caring and sweet messages daily. Reading emails of how much I’ve helped or inspired someone to live an overall healthy lifestyle is such a blessing in itself and puts such a smile on my face.
5. Plans for the future?
Right now I’m just following my love and passion and seeing where it leads me. I would absolutely love to make it into a career somehow down the road after becoming a registered dietitian, but I guess we will see! As for now, I do have one e-book available to purchase through my blog, freshﬁ  tnhealthy.com, and a new holiday e-book will be available in the beginning of October full of healthy holiday recipes!LAUREN ADAMSON

If only our food could talk, then there 
would be no confusion about what was still 
OK to eat or what should be thrown out. But of course, talking tomatoes would lead to a lot of general confusion and conflicted veg-etarians.  
But without the direct input from food, we 
rely on “sell by,” “use by” or “best before” labels to tell us when we can still drink that jug of milk or when it will result in stomach cramps a couple of hours later (and not the kind from having too much milk and cook-ies).
However, a recent study by the Natural 
Resources Defense Council (NRDC) reports consumers often misinterpret these labels and plenty of good, edible food goes in the trash. According to the council, the dates are not meant to indicate the safety of food but rather to suggest when the food is at its peak quality.
This misunderstanding results in the un-
necessary disposal of billions of pounds of food every year, according to the NRDC. Nearly half the food in America never gets eaten. That’s like throwing away $165 billion dollar bills.  
Confusion over date stamps leads nine 
out of 10 Americans to trash food that could have been consumed, according to a survey by the Food Marketing Institute. When many families are trying to save money, a seem-ingly simple thing like the method of labeling food is an important issue.Yet, Keith Schneider, 50, a professor in 
UF’s Department of Food Science and Hu-man Nutrition, said it is not that simple. Sch-neider said companies are trying to maintain a certain quality level, and they don’t want to give consumers a bad taste experience. For instance, he said if a company that sells crack-ers extends its product’s shelf life, it might still be edible by the end date, but the crack-ers may be slightly oxidized and stale.
“Consumers in the U.S. don’t like any-
thing that is not perfect,” Schneider said. Food manufacturers are aware of this and are very conservative with how they label prod-ucts.
UF anthropology senior Donna Smailes, 
20, said it is bummer that so many things are thrown away, but it’s business. “They are all in it to make money, so they want you to like their product when it is the best,” she said.
Also, companies may be afraid of being 
sued, Schneider said. A lot of the time milk is still safe to drink way past the “sell by” date, but corporations don’t want to take the risk of someone becoming sick.
Milk producers cannot be certain that 
their customers are going to properly store their milk, so they take our shortcomings into account when labeling their cartons. For in-stance, many college students may have mini refrigerators in their dorms with a knob that turns to different levels of cold. However, without thermometers in their fridges, they can’t ensure their milk is being stored at the correct temperature and will last the length of its optimum shelf life, so manufacturers are modest with their expiration dates.  
So you may think if “the man” cannot be 
trusted, you can at least rely on your senses. But Schneider warns against the sniff test. You are not going to know if there are patho-gens in the food by smelling it, he said. You will only be able to tell if it’s spoiled.
Smailes admits she judges food by how it 
smells.
“Unless it is milk, I don’t pay attention to 
sell by dates,” she said.
Schneider recommends going by the “first 
in, first out” rule, so eating your food in rota-tion according to when you buy it. He says he tries not to overbuy food, but instead gets groceries more frequently.
The NRDC proposes clarifying and stan-
dardizing the current labeling system in or-der to better communicate with consumers. The challenge will be to balance the reduction of America’s waste with its responsibility to keep its consumers safe.

Volunteer disc jockey Ricky Marrero 
perched on a bar stool in front of a micro-
phone. Ice-cold air conditioning blasted into a closet-sized room packed with music equipment and vinyl records.
“Welcome to ‘America in the Eve-
ning,’” he said. “I’m your host, Rik-kums.” And the drums picked up the tempo for the first song of the show.
Grow Radio, a grassroots nonprofit 
station, depends on a broad variety of music and volunteers to stay running. The local, Internet-based station is in need of volunteers.
“The broadest criteria that we are 
looking for is people passionate about music,” said Bill Bryson, general man-ager of the studio.
For volunteer DJs, radio shows are 
a weekly, two-hour commitment, and volunteers should be prepared to make a yearlong commitment.
Bryson started the radio station, found 
at growradio.org, in 2009 as an outlet for people who aren’t interested in the type of music FM radio usually offers.
“Variety and diversity are where we 
like to focus our musical interests,” he said. 
Volunteer DJs have to be willing to 
stay away from sticking to a specific genre. Programming at Grow Radio fol-lows a formatting that’s typically called free-form. At any given time, any type of music could be playing, Bryson said.
For “America in the Evening” host 
Marrero, variety is more of a freedom than a challenge. 
Marrero typically picks his first song 
on the day of his show and follows the music from there, he said.
Free-form pro-
gramming is different from the typical  radio programming. Most stations don’t give DJs the freedom to pick any song they like, Bryson said. 
The station allows each DJ’s taste to 
dictate the different music played.
“You’re going to get sick of your own 
music,” said Shawn Maschino, host of Grow Radio show “Lost Sharks,” “but there’s tons of exposure to new music, so it’s a good place to be.”
Not only are DJs allowed to play the 
music they want, but they also get to choose the format. Maschino tends to use vinyl to put on his show.
“I like vinyl — the aesthetic and the 
size,” he said. “There’s just something about holding the records.”
When Bryson started the station, he 
hoped the experience of volunteering as a DJ for Grow Radio would foster per-sonal growth as well as musical growth.
“If you’re a college student spending 
any or all of your four years involved with a station like this, it will give a lot back in terms of the college experience.”Independent radio

Andrew Baldizon didn’t catch M.I.A.’s mid-
dle-finger gesture during the Super Bowl half-
time show in 2012, but he heard about it and didn’t think much of it.
One month after the Feb. 5, 2012, halftime 
performance, which nearly 167 million view-ers tuned into, the NFL filed a lawsuit against English-Sri Lankan singer M.I.A. for giving the middle finger during her on-stage performance with Madonna.
Almost two years later, M.I.A. decided to 
make public the issue the NFL has been keep-ing a secret. 
According to the Hollywood Reporter, the 
Federal Communications Commission and NBC —  the network that aired the show —  have not entered any legal proceedings regard-ing the incident, but the NFL will continue to pursue M.I.A. for tarnishing its “reputation for wholesomeness.”
“I really didn’t think (the middle finger) was 
a big deal, considering players do it on the field every so often, and the fans do it all the time on TV,” said Baldizon, a 21-year-old UF political science senior.
On Monday, the singer gave a statement 
through a video on YouTube in response to the NFL’s claims. 
M.I.A.’s lawyer was quoted saying the 
league’s claim of a “wholesome reputation” is pretty funny considering the violence that oc-curs on and off the field with the players, but UF professor Lyrissa Lidsky said regardless of where the league’s values stand, it’s a simple matter of contract.
“The time to say the NFL is being hypocriti-
cal is before you agree to [signing away certain rights],” the Levin College of Law professor said.  
Clay Calvert, law professor and director of 
the Marion B. Brechner First Amendment Proj-ect at UF, agrees.
“Whether or not it hurts 
the NFL’s image is one thing, but the contract probably forbade her from engaging in these gestures,” he said.
In the video where she 
addresses the issue, M.I.A. said she’s being used.
“They’ve scapegoated me into figuring out 
the goalposts on what is offensive in America,” she said. 
Lidsky said the NFL might have tried to 
keep this issue under wraps to avoid drawing negative scrutiny toward the league.
Calvert agreed, saying the NFL might not 
have wanted to call attention to the issue be-cause “someone giving the middle-finger ges-ture during halftime performances (might) seem rather trivial to the public.”
According to the details of the legal proceed-
ing referenced by the Hollywood Reporter, the singer allegedly challenged the arbitration clause in the contract, failed to pay her share of the fine, failed to attend mediation and failed to take responsibility or apologize for her world-wide-broadcasted actions.  
Baldizon said he was surprised that the 
singer was being fined a sum of $1.5 million.
“The NFL usually fines players a couple of 
thousand [dollars] for the middle finger and sends them on their way,” he said. M.I.A.’s middle finger to

Solomon Patton has 
emerged as a playmaker for the Gators this season. Read the story 
on page 16.Driskel undergoes surgery
Jeff Driskel underwent successful surgery on his fractured right fibula Wednesday. The junior quarterback was injured in the first quarter of Saturday’s 31-17 win over Tennessee and will be out 4-6 months.PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer @phillip_heilman
No. 20 Florida will be without 
another top playmaker for the rest 
of this season.
Senior defensive tackle Do-
minique Easley injured his right knee during a non-contact drill in practice Tuesday and suffered a season-ending tear to his ACL and medial meniscus, coach Will Mus-champ said in a statement released Wednesday night.
“Watching any 
of your players go through this is one of the hard-est things about being a coach,” Muschamp said. 
“Obviously, it 
is hardest on Do-
minique. We are disappointed for him, but we will be there for him every step of the way through his surgery and rehab process.”
Earlier Wednesday, Muschamp 
said Easley would undergo further tests to determine the severity of his injury. However, it became ap-parent the senior defensive tackle’s season would be finished when he posted on his private Twitter ac-count (@MR_ChUcKiE_2) at 11:39 a.m. 
“Gatornation [sic] thank you for 
all of 4 yrs of sticking with me but god has something else planned for and have no worries #believe,” Eas-ley posted.
The senior can petition for a 
medical redshirt because he did not play in more than four games this season, past the sixth game of the year and can prove an actual injury. 
However, after mulling the deci-
sion to go pro following his junior season, Easley could opt to enter the 2014 NFL Draft. 
Sports Illustrated recently ranked 
the 6-foot-2, 285-pounder as the No. 15 overall prospect.
For Florida, losing Easley, who 
had become the team’s vocal leader during his final season, is a signifi-cant blow to the nation’s No. 2 unit.
Through three games, he had 
two tackles for a loss and was tied for the team lead with four quarter-back hurries.
“Dominique is a guy that has a 
great motor — great enthusiasm as you can see on the field,” defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. “He plays the game the way we want guys to play on defense.”
The added attention Easley re-quired from opposing offensive lines created opportunities for his teammates.
Buck linebacker Dante Fowler 
Jr. was named the Southeastern Conference Defensive Player of the Week after forcing two fumbles — he recovered one — while adding a sack to help Florida suffocate the Tennessee offense during a 31-17 victory on Saturday.
Fowler later thanked Easley 
for opening holes for him to make plays against a talented Volunteers offensive line.
“He busts his stuff up, and I’m 
outside, so when they see every-thing clogged up, the first they’re gonna do is bounce outside, and that’s all me,” Fowler said.
Easley previously experienced  a 
knee injury during his UF career. 
He suffered an ACL tear in his 
left knee while playing against Florida State on Nov. 26, 2011, but returned for the start of the 2012 season, in which he started in 11 games as a junior, finishing with 8.5 tackles for a loss, four sacks and one fumble recovery. 
Easley is the sixth UF player to 
suffer a season-ending injury this year.
Jeff Driskel (fractured right fibu-
la), Chaz Green (torn labrum), An-dre Debose (torn ACL), Matt Rolin (torn ACL) and Nick Washington (shoulder) are all done for the sea-son. 
“That’s just the game we play,” 
said offensive lineman Jon Halapio. “You just have to expect that peo-ple are going to get injured.”

Nearly a month into the season, 
No. 20 Florida will finally have its 
full complement of offensive line-men.
Since last summer, multiple 
linemen have suffered injuries that kept them out of games for extended periods of time, but al-most all — Chaz Green is out for the season after suffering a torn labrum — are expected to play against Kentucky on Saturday at 7 p.m.
“I just want to stay healthy, 
personally,” offensive guard Jon Halapio said, “and I want every-body else to stay healthy.”
Halapio kicked off the injuries 
on the line this season. 
He suffered a partially torn pec-
toral muscle while lifting weights in July. The injury caused Halapio to miss training camp and UF’s first two games of the season.
The redshirt senior returned to 
the field for Florida’s game against Tennessee on Sept. 21 but missed more time due to an unforeseen injury.
Halapio said he went to cut 
block a defender who was trying to avoid him. The defender’s hand got caught in the lineman’s face-mask, cutting his eye.
The injury took Halapio out of his season debut, but he returned later in the game.
 “I was defi-
nitely thinking, ‘I can’t catch a break,’” he said. “If it’s not my pec, it is some-
thing else.”
Added left tackle D.J. Humphries: 
“It looked like somebody knocked him out.”
But while Halapio was able to 
play through his injury, the Gators were still missing someone on the right side of the line.
Redshirt sophomore Tyler Moore (ankle) was scratched before the game on Saturday. Instead, Florida slid redshirt senior Kyle Koehne — typically a guard — out to tackle.
“I didn’t think I’d be playing 
tackle much this year,” Koehne said, “but numbers go down and my number’s called.”
Moore suffered his injury against 
Miami on Sept. 7. On Wednesday, coach Will Muschamp said Moore “looked good running [Tuesday].”
Other linemen suffered injuries 
as well. 
Humphries, junior Max Garcia 
and redshirt senior Jon Harrison, have suffered minor injuries that have kept them out for varying amounts of time. Humphries (knee) missed the second half against Mi-ami, while Garcia and Harrison missed shorter amounts of time against the Hurricanes.
Humphries said the line has not 
suffered due to the injuries, but the Gators have struggled with what was supposed to be the bread and butter of their offense — a punish-ing interior running game.
Florida is averaging 199.7 yards 
per game on the ground, which ranks 12th out of 14 in the run-based Southeastern Conference. 
Against the Volunteers, running 
backs Mack Brown and Matt Jones averaged 3.6 and 4.1 yards per carry,

Solomon Patton did not play much his first 
three seasons. 
He had a punt return here, a kick return 
there and the jet sweep that pigeonholed him 
as all speed.
Coach Will Muschamp approached Pat-
ton this offseason with a question: Do you just want to be a jet-sweep guy?
Through three games, Patton has answered 
with an emphatic no. His 212 yards and two touchdowns lead Florida receivers.
“I’ve always been hungry and wanting to 
play,” Patton said. “I just took this offseason to focus on a lot of different things. It’s starting to pay off.”
His junior season ended walking off the 
field, head hanging, with his left arm in a sling. Georgia safety Shawn Williams tackled Patton by the neck on a vicious hit near the Florida sidelines.
The Gators, down a touchdown on their 
first drive and needing a spark, dialed up Pat-ton’s signature jet sweep on fourth and 1. The 5-foot-9 receiver went in motion, took the Jeff Driskel handoff and ran off left tackle only to miss the rest of the season. Florida didn’t get the first down or the win.
Missing time left Patton with something to 
prove in his last season at UF. Patton put on 10-12 pounds to reach 179, he said. His listed weight was 169 in 2012.
He dedicated his offseason to route run-
ning and drinking protein shakes. But the added weight has not taken away from Pat-ton’s speed. On the second series with Tyler Murphy at quarterback against Tennessee, Patton took a screen pass 52 yards for a touch-down.
Patton made cornerback Devaun Swafford miss, slipped through safety Brian Randolph’s tackle and outran three Volunteers to the end zone. 
The sideline scamper wasn’t an eye opener. 
This is the player who had programs such as Alabama clamoring for his services coming out of high school. Patton even beat Julio Jones in the 100m dash running track in Mobile, Ala.
To see his evolution, look no further than 
his 46-yard over-the-shoulder catch against Miami two weeks earlier. Patton adjusted with the ball mid-flight on a Driskel play-ac-tion pass and hauled it in for Florida’s longest pass of the season.
Florida brought in former Kentucky coach 
Joker Phillips to revitalize its receivers corps. It’s been night-and-day for Patton and receiv-ers like Quinton Dunbar, who have helped fill the void left by tight end Jordan Reed.
Offensive coordinator Brent Pease noticed 
more explosive plays from the wideouts. Six of Patton’s 10 receptions have gone for more than 15 yards. He scored his first career touch-down — a 21-yard catch — during the final minutes against Miami.
His 118 receiving yards marked the highest 
output by a Florida pass catcher in 16 games. 
“We’re learning how to run our routes the 
right way, (and) at the right depth,” Patton said of Phillips. 
“Technique-wise and catching the ball, he 
has made a real huge impact.”There’s a new batch of raw talent among 
Florida’s wideouts. Ahmad Fulwood, who has one reception for five yards, is the only one of seven true freshmen with a catch. Pat-ton was there once.
“I just tell them, ‘Look at me. This is my se-
nior year, and I finally got my chance. I’m just taking advantage of it.’”

on Saturday in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Patton is Florida’s leading receiver in 2013.

Florida offensive line looking to protect redshirt junior quarter back
respectively.
“It’s just getting in a groove,” 
Humphries said. “The more we play, the easier the running game 
will open up.”
The line will need to open holes 
in the running game and secure gaps in the passing game.
Starting quarterback Jeff Driskel suffered a season-ending fractured fibula against Tennessee, handing the reigns of the offense to redshirt junior Tyler Murphy, who did not attempt an official pass until Satur-day.Behind Murphy are Florida’s 
two other scholarship quarterbacks — redshirt freshman Skyler Morn-hinweg and freshman Max Staver. Neither quarterback has played a down of college football.“We just have that sense of ur-
gency when our starting quarterback goes down,” Halapio said. “Tyler Murphy comes in — that’s basically one of our last options. We’ve just got to protect him.”
