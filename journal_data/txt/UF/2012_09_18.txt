When ﬁ  rst lady Michelle 
Obama walked onstage at the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center, she said one word: “Wow.”
She had reason to be im-
pressed. About 10,750 people — including UF students, Santa Fe College students and Gainesville residents of all ages — showed up to watch the ﬁ  rst lady speak after claiming free tickets last week.
Monday afternoon, the arena 
buzzed with excitement. Signs dotted the red, white, and orange and blue crowd. The audience sent the wave in circles, cheering and chanting “four more years” and “It’s great to be a Florida Gator.”
At about 4 p.m., UF student 
Alex Masi introduced Obama. The crowd went wild as she took the stage, and it reached a roar as she started doing the Gator chomp.
Obama opened by talking 
about her husband’s character and then elaborated, touching on issues like women’s rights, health care, student ﬁ  nances and the economy.
“When it comes time to make 
those tough calls and everyone’s urging you to do what’s easy, or what polls best, or what gets good headlines, as president, you need to be driven by the struggles, hopes and dreams of all of the people you serve,” Obama said.
The ﬁ  rst lady’s 30-minute 
speech was occasionally inter-rupted by shouts such as “I love you, Michelle!”
She emphasized voter registra-
tion, saying that about 36 votes per precinct made the difference First lady rallies

George P . Bush sat in the 
cool air of a tour bus, chat-ting with reporters in a slight southern accent. Born into politics as a Bush, he has mas-tered the political appearance.
“I’m just pandering,” he 
joked, touching the rim of his hat.
About 100 people came 
to The Swamp Restaurant’s patio to see Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. During his 15-minute appear-ance, Bush asked attendees if they were registered to vote and spoke about concerns fac-ing young voters.
Bush is the founder of Mav-
erick PAC, the political action committee that is funding his bus trip through Florida. The PAC typically caters to pro-fessionals between ages 25 and 45, but it is making a new push to reach more college students.
“President Obama did a 
great job among younger vot-ers,” Bush said, “so what we at MavPAC are doing is trying to coordinate with entities like the College Republicans and going to hit college campuses in key battleground states.”
The bus tour started Mon-day at Florida State University and will visit the University of Tampa, Valencia Community College, Palm Beach Atlantic University and Miami Dade College during the next few days.
“For the ﬁ  rst time in our 
country’s history, one in four young americans are living at home,” Bush said.
Some people in the crowd 
said they were glad someone spoke to their concerns.
Brandon Barger, a 21-year-
old business senior, said he’s worried about the next four years if President Barack Obama is re-elected.
“It’s good to hear someone 
who is concerned with young conservative voters,” Barger said.

University Police is investigating 
an incident in which a UF doctoral 
candidate was found unconscious on campus with serious injuries Wednes-day night.
At about 6 p.m. Wednesday , UPD 
received a call from a pedestrian who found Zachary Lovitch, 27, a music composition doctoral candidate, un-conscious across the street from the Biomedical Sciences Building on Cen-ter Drive.
Alachua County Fire Rescue took 
Lovitch to Shands at UF for treatment while UPD canvassed the area for evi-dence, said UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber.
Barber said police found Lovitch’s 
bike intact but did not ﬁ  nd any wit-nesses who may have seen the inci-dent. There were no cameras near the scene to record the incident.
The victim’s father, William Rich, 
said Lovitch suffered fractures to his face and a broken back.
When Lovitch woke up in the hos-
pital, he did not remember the inci-dent, Rich said.
Lovitch was released from the hos-
pital Sunday, he said.
The incident may have been a hit-
and-run, but police are still looking for witnesses, Barber said.
Anyone with information about the 
incident should contact UPD at 352-392-1111.

Hannah Siburt’s life changed 13 months 
ago.
The 29-year-old was a second-year audiol-
ogy Ph.D. student at UF when she gave birth to 
her son, Jacob. 
Although she was thrilled, after a while, jug-
gling classes, teaching, researching, working and scheduling family time began to leave her feeling isolated and misunderstood.
Then she met Melody Schiaffino, a health 
services, research, management and policy Ph.D. student and mother who had a project in mind to help them both.
Schiaffino formed PhDMoms, a support 
group new this semester designed to join doc-toral mothers who want to share, learn, study and grow together. 
The organization first met Sept. 10.Seventeen moms attended, and Schiaffino 
was blown away by the results.
“Moms were from nearly a dozen depart-
ments,” she said. “Some were expecting, others had newborns, others with toddlers or kinder -
garteners and even teens.”
Schiaffino’s motives for establishing the 
group came from her own feelings of seclusion and discouragement as a single mom and stu-dent.
“A female doctoral student parent is not 
common in any department,” she said. “I creat-ed PhDMoms to find other like-minded doctor -al student parents and to support each other.”
Her hope is that the group will support 
moms in every step of the doctoral program. 
PhDMoms will give them a place to “rest, 
vent and sound off on their concerns, struggles and stresses,” she said. 
They’ll also learn potential coping skills, find 
helpful resources and meet friends, Schiaffino said.
The group will meet every month at Corry 
Village Commons Room. Children and spouses are welcome to attend, and there’s a play area for children. T
Schiaffino said she was touched to see other 
mothers there had similar feelings.
“There was this sense of relief that there are 
other mothers going through the same thing,” she said.
At Siburt’s household, the emotional stress 
has decreased a bit.
While she’s not completely free of the physi-
cal and scheduling demands of motherhood and doctoral work, Siburt said the group makes her feel better, because it’s nice to know she has peers that empathize.
“Only the ones that are in the situation I’m in 
can understand it,” she said.PhDmoms support group

Mellow Maude’s Study Buddies
Hannah Gutman, a 19-year-old Santa Fe theater freshman, studies in 
front of Maude’s Classic Cafe on Monday night.
in the 2008 election.
“Especially for students — if you’ve 
just moved, if you haven’t reregistered, 
you’ve got to think about your situa-tion,” Obama said. “Don’t assume that you’re registered.”
Acknowledging that Election Day 
hours could impede some students from getting to the polls, Obama went off-script to urge people to cast their bal-lots.
“Pretend I’m not the first lady,” she 
said. “I’m like your mother. You’ve got to vote.”
After the event, attendees flooded the 
streets.Missy Goldstein, a 21-year-old Jewish 
studies senior, said the experience was inspiring.
“She just had everyone in the palm 
of her hand,” she said. “The second she went up there, people were silent and ready to listen.”
Materials science and engineering 
senior Claudia Sotomayor, 22, said she could tell Obama was passionate about the issues she addressed.
“You hear her talk, and you feel a rush 
of blood to your head,” Sotomayor said.

As part of a new promotion, 101 Cantina 
plans to give out 3,000 free shots as soon as it 
reaches 3,000 Twitter followers.    
As of Monday night, the account had 
about 2,800 followers.
Located at 1632 W. University Ave., 101 
Cantina uses its @101Cantina Twitter ac-count daily to push promotions and get cus-tomer feedback about food and drinks, said Ryan Prodesky, vice president of marketing.
Nick Mighion, a 21-year-old biology se-
nior, said he doesn’t have a Twitter account, so he didn’t know about the shot promo-tion. 
However, the idea definitely worked for 
him, he said.
“I would make a Twitter account, so I can 
be a follower of Cantina just so I can know when I can get free shots,” he said.
Once the company gains 3,000 followers, 
it will post the promotion’s exact date on its Twitter page. Customers don’t have to be followers to receive free shots.
Prodesky said the company has not dis-cussed the logistics of the event, like how many shots people will be able to get or how much it will cost Cantina to give out the free shots.
Prodesky said he is expecting a large 
crowd for this promotion, but the bar can only hold a certain number of people. Thirsty students craving free liquor should arrive early if they want to be allowed in the building.
Prodesky said the bar understands the 
importance of using social media to interact with customers, and it takes into account ev-erything customers mention — from what kind of music it plays to the ingredients in its tacos.
“Maybe one day we will be popular like 
Chandler Parsons and have over 50,000 fol-lowers,” he said. “That’s the goal.”Cantina to give out free shots

Downtown library overhaul renova-
tions are almost done after a year of work.
The library’s downtown headquarters 
is going through a three-step renovation project, including creating a quiet reading room, installing more computer desks and adding study areas with Wi-Fi.
The downtown library, 401 E. Univer -
sity Ave., will celebrate the grand re-open-ing of its revamped third floor at 9 a.m. on Sept. 27.  
The last phase of renovations starts this 
fall and will focus on the children’s area.
“It’s just another step in our ongoing 
renovations,” said Nickie Kortus, market-ing and public relations manager of the Alachua County Library District. “We pride ourselves on being patron driven and friendly.”
As part of the changes, popular books 
have been shifted closer for easier access,  public computers have been regrouped next to the printers and walls have been repainted.  
Ray Dantone, Gainesville resident, said 
the renovations look like they’re focused on helping library patrons get more out of the services.
Library staff said a lot of attention has 
been given to the quiet reading room.
“I think it’s necessary in terms of hav-
ing a place away from the main library ,” said Lisely Laboy, a full-time library assis-tant. “It’s a real positive.”  
Kortus said the quiet reading room 
is the most popular room of the library’s Milhopper branch.

lute silence,” she said.Downtown library renovations

UF is the 54th best college in the 
country , according to U.S. News & 
World Report rankings.
The ranking system is based on 
factors including freshman retention rates, test scores, faculty-to-student ratio, reputation and graduation rates, and included 281 public and private universities. UF tied with Pepperdine University for 54th place nationally.
UF is the highest-ranking Florida 
public school on the list. The Univer -
sity of Miami ranked 44th, and Florida State University ranked 97th.
Bethany Schuster, an 18-year-old 
public relations junior, said she’s im-pressed by the rankings but thinks UF should have been higher.
“The College of Journalism and 
Communications is one of the top in the nation,” she said. “How does that translate to 54th overall?”
Schuster said she thought UF’s rep-
utation as a party school may have also affected the ranking.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said 
UF is pleased with 
the results.
“The university 
has worked very hard to keep mov-ing forward despite a challenging budget situation, and those efforts seem to be paying off,” he said.
Orlando said some people may be 
critical of the methodology that U.S. News & World Report uses, but stu-dents and parents pay attention to its Best Colleges list.
“Measuring an experience can be 
a little bit of a subjective thing some-times,” he said. “Rankings help put some sort of measurement in there.”UF is 54th best US college

� OCCUPY GAINESVILLE WILL HOST 
AN EVENT LATER IN THE MONTH.
SHELBY WEBB

In the early weeks of Occupy Wall Street, 
movements popped up across the nation 
and the world. Occupy Gainesville soon followed suit.
Occupy Gainesville observed the one-
year anniversary of its parent movement Monday. However, the organization de-cided not to host an event. Instead it opted to celebrate Occupy Gainesville’s one-year anniversary later this month, said Tommy Baker, a UF alumnus.
During the past year, Occupy Gainesville 
has been in the local spotlight for a series of arrests and protests.
Baker said the Gainesville movement 
has been successful overall.“Compared to where we were a year 
ago, I feel a lot better about my community and that my community can come togeth-er,” he said.
Here’s a look at Occupy Gainesville’s 
year:
- Oct. 5: Occupy Gainesville hosted an 
informational meeting on the Bo Diddley Community Plaza to start the city move-ment.
- Oct. 13: Occupy UF hosted a meeting 
to form the university movement
- Oct. 14: Several protesters, including 
Bo Diddley’s son, were arrested for tres-passing on Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
- Nov. 13: Police arrested about 20 Oc-
cupy Gainesville protesters for trespassing on Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
- Jan. 22: Best-selling author Cornel West 
led an Occupy Gainesville protest to the front of the Alachua County Courthouse.

Curtis Hines wanted to buy drugs early 
Sunday morning, but when he didn’t have 
enough money, his drug dealer suggested robbing a Domino’s Pizza store.
At about 3:10 a.m. Sunday, Hines, 36, 
walked into the store in the 2000 block of Southwest 13th Street and demanded money from the cashier, according to a Gainesville Police arrest report.
Hines said he had a gun, and the cashier 
gave him $60. He then fled to meet up with his dealer, Michael Deangelo Clayton, 25.
When officers arrived, a witness identified 
Hines as the person who robbed the store.
GPD arrested Hines at 1:16 a.m. on Mon-
day and charged him with armed robbery and possession of drug paraphernalia, ac-cording to Alachua County Jail records. 
Later that morning, Hines said in an inter -
view with GPD detectives that Clayton told him to rob the store to pay for the drug deal.
Officers found Clayton 
at the ABC Motel, located off Southwest 13th Street, and arrested him at about 4 a.m. Police charged Clayton with drug posses-sion, criminal conspiracy 
and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to jail records.
Police booked Clayton and Hines into 
Alachua County Jail early Monday, where they remained later that night with bonds set at $100,000 and $505,000 respectively.

This weekend, students can see an el-
ephant painting. No, not a painting of an 
elephant.
Luke the elephant will paint for an audi-
ence this weekend as part of Elephant Ap-preciation Day. He is one of four elephants that will participate in the event, at Two Tails Ranch, 18655 NE 81st St., Williston, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday.
Admission is $10 for adults and $5 for 
children ages 9 and younger.
Elephant Appreciation Day will feature 
elephant demonstrations, a horse perfor -
mance and animals such as zebras, ostrich-es and emus. There will be pony rides, face painting, 
food and music.
Patricia Zerbini, ranch owner, said the 
event will raise money for the ranch and its nonprofit, All About Elephants. The orga-nization teaches the public about wild and captive elephants, Zerbini said.
Kim Schell, a 20-year-old UF biology 
junior, said she’s been to the ranch dur -
ing a volunteer project. She thought it was “random” for elephants to roam a Florida ranch, but she enjoyed the experience.
Zerbini said she has to rely on word-of-
mouth to advertise ranch events and tours, because all the money she makes goes back into the ranch.
“Hopefully, this will also alert the pub-
lic a little more about the ranch,” she said.Event will feature painting

Gainesville may welcome art 
in all its forms, but its job market 
for professional theater is about as bad as the rest of the country’s.
While UF’s School of Theater + 
Dance graduates a steady stream of students, the Hippodrome State Theatre is the primary place to get a paying theater job in Gainesville, said Charlie Mitch-ell, a UF assistant professor in the School of Theater + Dance.
A survey by the Actors Eq-
uity Association showed that from 2010 to 2011, 58.3 percent of actors in the association were employed per season, a percent-age that increased more than 10 percent from the 2000 to 2001 sea-sonal unemployment rate.
Mitchell came to teach at UF 
four years ago after working as an actor in New York City during the worst part of the economic reces-sion. Barely anyone was produc-ing shows, so he came to Florida.“It was fortunate I got this job, 
because it was really sort of a des-olate time,” he said.
Mitchell teaches Theater Ap-
preciation with the help of teach-
ing assistants from all over the country, he said. They are attract-ed to Gainesville for the educa-tion and teaching potential rather than the acting scene.
UF acting professor Tim Alt-
meyer came to Gainesville from 
New York for the same reason.
However, he said, acting jobs 
in Gainesville are sparse.
“Professionally speaking, it’s 
limited,” he said. “I would say it’s not a place where you want to sort of settle if you plan on just working Gainesville as an actor.”
To move forward in their ca-
reers, UF graduates travel to ma-jor cities in Florida like Orlando and Miami, where there are great-er theater and commercial mar -
kets, Altmeyer said.
Altmeyer and Mitchell said 
that the School of Theater + Dance provides students with exten-sive training for the professional world.
“It’s a very creative commu-
nity,” Altmeyer said, “so I think a lot of exciting talent is born here.”
Paul Poppe, a 19-year-old the-
atre and advertising sophomore, has been acting since fourth grade and opted for a double major to continue what he loves.
“I can pursue a passion and 
also something that can give me a possible career in the future,” he said.
He’s found a student acting

Boy Scouts of America 
should be sorry
You know how the Boy Scouts of America ofﬁ  cially ex-
cludes gay people from joining its organization? Yeah, that’s not super.
You know what’s worse?Recent reports state that the BSA has covered up decades of 
alleged child molestation that occurred under its roof.
The Los Angeles Times reviewed 1,600 conﬁ  dential ﬁ  les 
dating from 1970 to 1991 and “found that Scouting ofﬁ  cials frequently urged admitted offenders to quietly resign — and helped many cover their tracks.”
The organization calls them the “perversion ﬁ  les.” In about 80 percent of those cases, the allegations were not 
reported to police.
The people “suspected of abuse were allowed to leave citing 
bogus reasons such as business demands, ‘chronic brain dys-function’ and duties at a Shakespeare festival,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
Apparently , being gay is more of a crime to the BSA than is 
being a pedophile.
Perhaps the organization should care more about the mem-
bers it does allow than the members it bans.
As a country, America teaches children to tell an adult whom 
they trust when something is wrong. When no action is taken against a terrible situation, what lesson are we teaching them?
The fact that so many cases, a system of ﬁ  les dating back to 
1919, have not been reported to authorities is unsettling. They have instituted a way to cover up and shame the truth — for what purpose?
Was it to make the organization look better? Was no one sup-
posed to uncover what has actually happened so that people would continue to put their faith and trust in the group?
Because this has done exactly the opposite.This paper trail unearthed how awful this organization can 
be.
What’s worse is that people will, probably while reading this 
piece, suggest that the entire club isn’t so bad, and we shouldn’t generalize a few slights to turn everyone against the club as a whole.
Well, united we stand, folks. The simple fact that this hap-
pened at all ever, anywhere is what’s enough to make people angry at the club. And people should be angry.
People were already angry at the BSA for its discriminatory 
practices. It makes no sense to ban members due to their sexual orientations. Was the club under the impression that a homo-sexual person is automatically some kind of sexual predator or threat?
Because clearly it was wrong.Actual predators were, and continue to be, right under its 
nose — not even hiding — and it did nothing about it.
Instead of forcing an intolerant system of rules, BSA, how 
about you focus on standing up for your members, no matter who they are.
Intolerance may be widely spread across our country, but 
child abuse acceptance should never be.Voter apathy is absolutely pathetic
I    don’t care how much you hate politics. If you are eli-
gible, you need to vote in the upcoming presidential election.
If you are eligible to vote and choose not to, please take a 
moment to contact me to explain your reasoning.
I’m really interested to ﬁ  nd out if I can empathize with 
anyone’s choice to disregard such a privilege. Right now, I 
don’t think I can.
I overheard responses like “Don’t worry about it” and 
“No, excuse me” to somebody who was doing nonpartisan voter registration after he asked passersby if they were reg-istered to vote.
I stared with my mouth agape as the last person to reject 
the worker ran to catch a bus that would return in another 15 minutes.
The sentiment toward our country would be so much bet-
ter if everyone had that same determination regarding vot-ing and if they rushed to cast ballots instead.
It also hurts me to know that people blatantly lie when 
others go out of their way to see that everyone eligible votes.
To “not like” either of the candidates or parties is not a 
valid excuse.
For the pessimists out there, remember that nothing in 
this world is perfect. It never has been, and it never will be.
Life itself is about making choices.Each day , we have to choose between the lesser of two 
evils, the greater of two goods, whatever will in the end offer the greatest beneﬁ  t at the least expense.
Of all the reasons and excuses I’ve heard defending vot-
ing avoidance, I ﬁ  nd none of them reasonable or justiﬁ  able.
Neglecting the opportunity to vote is not only selﬁ  sh 
but extremely ungrateful. Remember that people went to extremes to ﬁ  ght for this right. Even if you don’t personally identify with one of those speciﬁ  c groups, respect the nation you live in by participating in voting.
People in places across the world do not have many of the 
rights, privileges and opportunities we do, let alone a say in government.
Young people especially should know that many of the 
platform issues in this election will affect their current and fu-ture lives as students, employees, possible parents and more.
Maybe voting should be feder-
ally required, like ﬁ  ling taxes.
I wonder how much voter 
turnout would increase by if vot-ing were a requirement to receive Federal Pell Grants, student loans, food stamps, affordable health in-surance or any other government 
assistance.
It’s sad and confusing that people have to coerce others 
into doing something that will ultimately beneﬁ  t them.
I can’t understand what is so scary about voting.We should be thankful to live in a place where there are 
no threats made against us and no negative consequences for playing our role as informed and involved citizens.
Voting in this election is critical enough that you should 
take a little time out of your day to register and vote when the time comes.
The deadline to register in Florida is Oct. 9.If you walk outside your door between now and then, 
I can almost guarantee you somebody will approach you about voter registration.
If your registration is nonexistent or not current (most 
commonly regarding your address), take advantage of the convenience, and ﬁ  x it.
If you choose to stay registered in a county other than that 
of your current residence, be sure to request an absentee bal-lot, and submit it in a timely manner.
To those who understand the importance of voting, please 
continue to educate others, and encourage them to make their voices heard. Be persistent, although trying to persuade that one unyielding friend to cast his or her ballot can feel like pulling teeth.
To those who need a push: Stop being stubborn. Register 
to vote and show up to cast your ballot once the polls open.

If you’ve filled up at the pump recently, you were prob-
ably reminded how much it costs to drive. But all the gas, insurance, repairs and other things you pay for are 
not the only driving costs. Your contribution to traffic con-gestion places cost on other drivers; your wear and tear on the roads puts cost on taxpayers; and cost is borne by the environment due to the pollution from your car.
These are three examples of the many external driving 
costs, or what economists call negative externalities.
It was first recommended in 1920 by Arthur Pigou, an 
economist from the University of Cambridge, that nega-tive externalities be taxed to internalize the costs.
Pigovian taxes are a way to make individuals pay for 
the costs they place on others.
President Barack Obama recently announced man-
dates for dramatic increases in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, but this is economically harmful.
A 2007 study published in “Economic Inquiry” found 
that an 11-cent increase in gas tax would conserve the same amount of fuel as a 3 mpg increase in the CAFE standards. More importantly, it found that the increased CAFE stan-dards would have a welfare cost 14 times greater than the tax increase. Many other studies have corroborated the finding that paradoxically, gasoline taxes are the less ex-pensive way to conserve fuel.
The problem with fuel efficiency standards is that they 
do not change consumer preferences.
Energy policy needs to affect consumer behavior to re-
duce energy usage. When the gasoline price rises, drivers get creative.
They carpool, use mass transportation, buy a more 
fuel-efficient vehicle, walk, bike or even move closer to work.
Higher gasoline taxes are a 
less invasive way to alter mar -
ket demand by making it a financially beneficial decision to buy a fuel-efficient car.
If consumers want more fuel-efficient cars, as they 
would with higher gas prices, CAFE standards become altogether futile.
America’s problem with the rest of the energy crisis is 
similar.
The debate rages about how to force the economy to 
use “green” types of energy sources, and the response is often subsidies.
Because every major form of energy production is 
subsidized in the U.S., — oil, coal, gas, nuclear, wind and more — the net result is that all energy is less expensive.
Just as with gasoline, people consume much more en-
ergy when it is at lower prices. While there is much dis-course about energy independence and its national secu-rity implications, the government is aiding and abetting the problem by promoting the use of energy.
If energy were more expensive, people would have 
a greater incentive to use it sparingly . Businesses would make their products more energy efficient for consum-ers who are watching their utility bills. It would be more profitable to research and invest in innovation for energy efficiency and conservation.
Yet, we are making energy less expensive and conse-
quently decreasing private investment in innovative en-ergy technology.
If you tax something, you get less of it.This economic phenomenon should teach a simple 
lesson: We should focus on taxing things that are bad for society, not things that are good for society.
Our tax system largely focuses on taxing income, which 
is something society wants. Pigovian taxation would be even more powerful in increasing market efficiency and bipartisanship agreement if it coincided with decreased taxes on things that are good for society, such as income.
I believe that a majority of politicians would support 
higher gasoline taxes as proudly as the large majority of economists if not for the public affixation to measure their performance by the price at the pump.
The next time there’s a spike in the price of gas, there’s 
sure to be a lot of pessimism in the media, but economists everywhere will smile.

UWireOn Sept. 10, 25,000 Chicago public school teachers 
went on strike to protest the educational reform agenda proposed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
Following reforms in New York City, Emanuel pushed 
to extend the school day length, rescinded a promised teachers’ raise and introduced a stricter teacher evaluation process that accounts for student standardized test perfor -
mances.
The teachers won’t have any of it.Ultimately, the major point of contention between the 
mayor and the teachers is the evaluation of teacher perfor -
mance based on student test scores. Emanuel’s proposal is not new. Thirty-three states have created similar evalua-tion processes, claiming it is the most meritocratic system available. But union officials argue that this system will unfairly punish teachers whose students face personal challenges, such as socioeconomic distress, which may negatively or unfairly affect test performance.
This is a valid point to some extent — in Chicago, about 
87 percent of students come from low-income families.
However, the policy also includes a provision that al-
lows teachers to appeal their ratings, should they chal-lenge the fairness of the evaluation.
Many reformers believe teachers unions overuse pov-
erty as an excuse for poor performance. Recent films like “Waiting for Superman” (2010) and “Won’t Back Down” (2012) further criticize unions as an impediment to edu-cational reform by prioritizing teacher wages before a crippled education system.
In Chicago’s case, the teachers are too resistant to nec-
essary reform. With 60 percent of Chicago students gradu-ating high school, Emanuel was right to extend the school day.
The most critical reform for struggling school districts 
is a more comprehensive system to evaluate teacher per -
formance, and testing should not be taken off the table.
Granted, the current system of once-a-year exams 
needs to go.
Rather, students should take several exams throughout 
the year to show improvement, a more statistically signifi-cant measure of a teacher’s effect, despite outliers. These exams should be heavily employed in elementary schools, where teachers have the most potential to positively affect students’ education.
Critics argue this will inspire teachers to tailor lessons 
to exams. Perhaps, but is it really so bad if exams test cru-cial reading, writing and math skills?
Apart from exams, Chicago must soften tenure protec-
tions to ensure better evaluations. To clarify, tenure is not intended to protect against poor performance but rather to protect teachers from being fired based on arbitrary reasons like political af-filiation or a principal’s whim.
Educational activist and Har -
lem Children’s Zone president Geoffrey Canada has ar -
gued that the tenure system has gone too far.
He believes that too often, school administrations use 
tenure as an excuse to not evaluate their teachers thor -
oughly.
A thorough evaluation is not only a rigorous testing 
regimen, though test results should not be excluded from consideration. A fair evaluation takes a lot of work and incorporates soft factors that are not as black and white as test scores. 
In response to this dilemma, the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation has started the Measure of Effective Teaching Project to formulate a consistent evaluation system for school administrations.
According to a study conducted by Stanford University 
professor Linda Darling-Hammond, thorough evaluations reveal innovative and effective teaching methods better than purely test-based performance measures.
Teachers’ unions need to be more reasonable in the face 
of reform.
They must forego some job security or protection of 
teachers who underperform just as administrations need to offer teachers more oversight, support and respect for effective work. Lord knows that teaching underprivileged children is not easy.
Perhaps slam poet and former school teacher Taylor 
Mali put it best when he said, “Instead of obsessing about our worst teachers, we need to start a new national con-versation about what it takes to be a great teacher.”
Yet, even the greatest of teachers cannot alone save this 
system.
Ultimately, our nation’s public schools are facing a cri-
sis, and we need a collaborative and open effort to reform them. Past policies have left us with overcrowded class -
rooms, unsafe schools, demoralized teachers (even the good ones) and egregious funding inequity, among other things. Good teachers and rigorous testing will not com -
pletely transform public education.
But for the sake of the 350,000 students in Chicago, let’s 
save the playground fights for recess, and get classes back in session.

It’s only September, but some Gainesville 
retailers have already started preparing for 
the holiday season.
At the Kohl’s on 3501 SW Archer Road, 
there’s an ornate Christmas section near the back of the store. Rows of ornaments, snow globes and smiling Santa Claus figurines are on display. Christmas cards, stockings and fake snow are for sale — right next to Hal-loween decorations.
Assistant store manager Andrea Kress 
said retailers transition into holidays earlier than the general public. The Kohl’s display has been up for a week.
“We’re trying to maximize sales,” Kress 
said.
She said people have shown interest in 
the items during the last few days. The dis-play will stay up until late December.
At The Oaks Mall, stores’ setups vary. 
Belk and Macy’s have sections with Christ-mas merchandise. As of Friday, J.C. Penney had not decorated for Christmas, and a Sears employee said the store was setting up a dis-play that day.
Oaks Mall spokesman William Bivins 
said each store decides when to decorate for Christmas. The mall will put up its own Christmas display Nov. 10.
Steven Kirn, executive director of UF’s 
David F. Miller Center for Retailing Educa-tion and Research, said retailers set up early to try to extend the holiday season and en-courage customers to spend more.
“It’s clearly the biggest-selling season of 
the year for retailers, and it’s been creeping earlier and earlier each year,” he said.
Shoppers might shop for gifts earlier if 
Christmas items are on sale, he said.
Kirn said store Christmas displays may 
appeal to people who buy gifts far in ad-vance, and it could help shoppers realize the holiday season is closer than they had thought.
But 18-year-old psychology sophomore 
Arline Herrera thinks putting up Christmas decorations before Halloween is excessive.
“My family usually puts Christmas deco-
rations up after Thanksgiving, and I think a lot of people do too,” she said. “I think it’s better to just leave it around that time.”TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

When Grace Collins sees a report 
about a natural disaster on the news, 
she wants to get there to help out as soon as she can.
“But I guess I’m just one girl,” the 
22-year-old UF law student said. “I can’t be everywhere.”
Collins is up for the NCAA Wom-
an of the Year award, which is giv-en based on athletic and academic achievements, community service and leadership. Collins is among the top three finalists from Division II and will face six more candidates from divisions I and III for the award. She will attend the award banquet Oct.14 at NCAA headquarters in In-dianapolis.
Collins just started classes at UF’s 
Levin College of Law and was nomi-nated this summer by Barry Universi-ty, from which she graduated in May.
Dennis Jezek Jr., Barry’s sports 
information director, nominated Col-lins for the award. He said there was no question about who the university would nominate.
“A lot of athletes at Barry have ser -
vice hours, but the thing about Grace is we have never had anyone with as much community service as her — like, ever,” Jezek said. “No one’s been quite like her.”
During her time at Barry, she or -
ganized a campuswide effort to send packages to soldiers stationed over -
seas through the organization Amer -
ica’s Moms for Soldiers.
Despite having the packed sched-
ule of a student athlete, she went throughout campus between classes and practices and sat at tables, urging other students to sign letters for the soldiers’ care packages.
When floods ravaged Nashville in 
2010, Collins went to help. She volun-teered at a thrift store there, moving furniture and organizing clothes. She also spent time with LP PENCIL Box, an organization that gives away free school supplies to educators.
“You can donate stuff and never 
really understand your impact,” she said. “But if you go there, you can re-ally see the damages firsthand.”
Collins toured Nashville and saw 
water damage, mold and peeling walls. The people’s faces there still burn in her mind, she said.
“It kind of shocks you to see that 
— it’s scary,” she said. “But it brings a smile to your face, knowing they’re thankful you’re just there.”
Collins, who played softball at 
Barry, was inspired by the athletic training staff there. She said giving future athletes opportunities like those the Barry staff gave her would be “a dream come true.”
That dream ranked UF’s law school 
No. 1 on Collins’ list due to its role in the Southeastern Conference and opportunities for networking, she said. At UF, she plans to specialize in sports law and possibly to intern with the UF athletic department.
Collins is the eighth finalist Barry 
has sent since the NCAA began giv-ing out the award in 1995, Jezek said.
Jezek said Collins was the first 
student athlete to win the Barry Uni-versity President’s Award, which is given to the school’s most outstand-ing senior.
In the meantime, Collins said, 
she’s humbled to get this far in the competition.
“I do these things not for the rec-
ognition, but because I like to help other people,” she said. “But to say it’s been easy would be a lie.”UF law student, athlete

 Jeff Driskel looks the part, but 
he’s not ready to compare himself to 
another running  quarterback from Florida’s past.
  Still, the sophomore showed on 
Saturday why he is mentioned in the same conversation as Tim Tebow.
  On a ﬁ  rst-and-10 in the ﬁ  rst quar-
ter, Driskel and Omarius Hines muffed an exchange on a wide re-ceiver sweep. Driskel picked up the bouncing ball in the midst of an on-coming pass rush and ran 10 yards for a ﬁ  rst down.
  His improvisation consistently 
extended drives for Florida.
  “I’ve deﬁ  nitely heard those com-
parisons, even back in high school,” Driskel said. “Just because of our body size and the way we can run the ball. It’s nice to be compared, but I wouldn’t go that far and say I try to be like him, or watch his ﬁ  lm and try to be like him. But I guess we do play similar styles.”
  Driskel earned Southeastern 
Conference Offensive Player of the Week honors after racking up 219 passing yards, 81 rushing yards and two touchdowns against Tennessee. 
  Through his ﬁ  rst three games this 
season, Driskel has 608 yards of total offense. His 113 rushing yards rank fourth among SEC quarterbacks.  In 2007, his ﬁ  rst season as UF’s 
starter, Tebow amassed 192 rushing yards through three games. He also won the Heisman Trophy.
  Driskel may not belong in the 
same conversation as Tebow, but like the Heisman Trophy winner, he isn’t afraid of an oncoming tackler.
  “I try to make a vertical cut and 
get as many yards as possible,” Driskel said. “I don’t really try to get out of bounds.”
  The threat of a 6-foot-4, 237-pound 
running quarterback presents the same quandary for defenses that Tebow did for his three years as  a starter.
  Add in versatile Trey Burton, and 
the Gators have a deep backﬁ  eld with Driskel and running back Mike Gillislee.
  “A one-back set is a two-back set 
now,” Muschamp said. “A two-back set is a three-back set. You create a lot of issues for a defense when a guy has legs at the quarterback po-Driskel drawing Tebow comparisons with rushing prowess

 Lerentee McCray’s hard work is ﬁ  nally 
paying off.
  In the second half of Saturday’s 37-20 
win against Tennessee, Florida was domi-
nant on both sides of the ball, outgaining UT 389 to 134 during the game’s ﬁ  nal 30 minutes. McCray, a redshirt senior Buck linebacker, was a big part of the defense’s success as he consistently pressured Vol-unteers’ quarterback Tyler Bray and in-tercepted him on the third drive of the game.
  McCray played sparingly his ﬁ  rst three 
years for Florida, accumulating just 16 tackles. He suffered a shoulder injury af-ter starting the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games of the 2011 season and saw limited action the rest of the year.
  “Just been a lot of hard work,” McCray 
said of earning an increased role. “A lot of dedication, just trying to get better and better every day.”
  Coach Will Muschamp praised Mc-
Cray’s work ethic and said his pass-rushing skills have helped the team im-mensely. 
  “He’s a threat off the edge, but he’s also 
a heavy-handed guy,” Muschamp said. “He can really get his hands on people and get them off of him. He’s a guy that can convert speed to power in the rush, which is critical for a speed rusher, which is what he is.”

  On Saturday, the Hot Light burned brightly. Trey Burton was making doughnuts.
  The night sky in Knoxville, Tenn., 
was ﬁ  lled with the sweet smell of crul-lers, bear claws and Boston cream as Florida celebrated its 37-20 victory against Tennessee.
  Burton carried the ball three times 
for 91 yards and two touchdowns, in-cluding a game-tying 80-yard score late in the third quarter. 
His second touchdown kicked off a 
string of 24 unanswered points scored by the Gators during the game’s ﬁ  nal 19 minutes.
  The aroma was familiar. Florida has enjoyed this sweetness 
before.
  Two years ago, UF enjoyed sugar rushes cour-tesy of Burton against two un-ranked South-eastern Confer-ence opponents — Kentucky and Georgia. Both teams ﬁ  nished 
the season 6-7. In those two games, Bur-ton tallied 290 all-purpose yards. 
  Prior to this year, Burton has rarely 
fared well against ranked opponents. In nine games against Top-25 teams, Burton has averaged just 23.1 yards per contest.

 UF quarterbackdid not go well.
Facing a critical fourth-and-1 during the 
first half of last season’s loss to Florida State, 
UF elected to run Burton up the middle. 
Overwhelmed by the Seminoles’ push 
at the line of scrimmage, Burton ran back-wards in an attempt to get outside and lost 14 yards.
In Florida’s 20-17 victory against Texas 
A&M on Sept. 8, the Gators decided to hand off to Burton on second-and-goal on the 6-yard line. 
Burton again ran backwards to avoid the 
stuffed defensive front, but only lost two yards due to some impressive maneuvering in a frantic attempt to get back to the line of scrimmage.
Even Urban Meyer learned the hard way 
that UF cannot run on Dunkin’.
John Brantley led Florida deep into Ala-
bama territory before he was pulled for Bur -
ton. 
Burton ran twice for no gain, then threw 
an interception on a jump pass.
Both Muschamp and offensive coordina-
tor Brent Pease have emphatically praised Burton’s versatility and intelligence. 
According to the Gators offensive staff, 
he’s the Gabby Douglas of mental gymnastics — a term Pease used during fall camp to de-scribe the process of learning his offense.However, UF should give the majority of 
touches to more effective options like Mike Gillislee, Jordan Reed and maybe even Jeff Driskel down the road. 
When the going gets tough in the heart of 
the SEC schedule, those are the guys Florida should trust.
Burton is a good football player, but he 
should not be the Gators’ go-to playmaker.
He is most effective in the wildcat forma-
tion, a scheme that works more as a gimmick than anything else.
No good defense would have been fooled 
by Burton's 80-yard run after UF ran the same play — only reversed — on his 14-yard score in the first quarter.
When you're starving, doughnuts won't 
cut it. They are arguably the emptiest carbs one can eat.
If the football season is a day, then Florida 
will finish breakfast against Kentucky this weekend. 
But beyond the morning hours, doughnuts 
are merely dessert — an added bonus.
If the Gators want to sit at the grown-ups 
table, they need to eat wholesome meals.
So, keep making those doughnuts, Mr. 
Burton. 
If the Gators eat as much as they plan to 
this season, they’ll find a way to make some room for dessert.

Special Teams: The Gators’ punt team ef-
fectively limited the Volunteers on Satur -
day, allowing just one punt return on five opportunities. Sophomore punter Kyle Christy punted from  Florida’s 7-yard line after UF’s first drive and pinned the Volun-teers on their own 38-yard line with a 55-yard kick.
“Kyle Christy flipped the field twice,” 
Muschamp said after the game. “Normally you get to the 50. One first down, they’re in field goal range.”
Muschamp said on Monday that Chris-
ty’s punts gave the Gators momentum. Christy was named one of the special teams players of the week. 
Through its first three games, Florida has 
punted 15 times and has allowed just four returns for three yards.
Injuries: Right tackle Chaz Green is prob-
able for Saturday’s game against Kentucky, Muschamp said on Monday. Green left UF’s game against Texas A&M with cramps and also suffered an ankle injury, which forced him to miss Saturday’s game against Ten-nessee.“Probably was a game-time decision in 
an emergency situation,” Muschamp said of Green sitting against the Volunteers. “If we had had some injuries, probably could have played, but we held him.”
Defensive end Dominique Easley left 
Florida's game against Tennessee with a knee injury. Easley suffered an ACL tear in his left knee during UF’s game against FSU on Nov. 26, 2011. Muschamp said it was simply inflammation and that Easley is day-to-day. His status for Kentucky will be determined based on how he progresses throughout the week.
Muschamp also said that cornerback 
Cody Riggs is still out due to a broken bone in his right foot suffered against Texas A&M, while linebacker Jelani Jenkins remains out due to the broken right thumb he injured in the same game. 
Muschamp said he will update the status 
of both Riggs and Jenkins on Wednesday.

ferent things that you’re doing in the misdirection off the run game.”
Driskel used the running game to set up his passing 
on Saturday. On a third-and-7 in the fourth quarter, he recognized a cornerback blitz and found receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. for a 75-yard touchdown.
Gators coach Will Muschamp mentioned the play as 
one example of his quarterback showing his maturity on the field.“He made really good decisions,” Muschamp said. 
“He got us in and out of the right runs. He got us out of some run situations versus a bad run box to the other side or to a pass, and he was able to do those things at a very high level.” 
Muschamp named Driskel the 
starter ahead of Jacoby Brissett after a six-month quarterback competi-tion. The experience of the past three 
weeks has improved Driskel’s intangibles.
“It comes with the game reps and getting those live 
reps,” Hammond said. “I’m sure the game is slowing down for him, and he’s starting to read things out and just playing quarterback and playing fast and making good decisions.”
While Driskel has started to grasp the mental aspects 
of quarterback, his natural ability is nothing new to his teammates.
“We hated two-minute (drills) because we turn our 
backs, and he takes off running,” senior linebacker Jon Bostic said. “Then, we’ve got to turn around and run and try to catch him. So, we always knew he could run. We knew he could throw. Basically, it’s just putting every-thing together and being able to go out and help us win the ball game.”

Freshman Gordon Watson hits a forehand during Sunday’s action in the Bedford 
Cup in Linder Stadium at the Ring Tennis Complex.
MAX MATTERN
Alligator Writer
 
One year ago, Southeastern Conference 
tennis programs such as Georgia, Mississippi 
State and Vanderbilt sought highly touted re-cruit Gordon Watson.
Watson was undecided on where he 
wanted to play collegiate tennis — until he visited Gainesville.
UF’s campus was Watson’s final visit, as 
he fell in love with the facilities and staff. 
“It felt like home,” Watson said at the 
time. “I really loved the other schools on my list, but I realized that I wanted to continue my training in Florida after my visits.”
That Watson won his first collegiate tour -
nament in the same city he fell in love with was only fitting.
Watson defeated North Florida’s Moritz 
Buerchner in three sets Monday morning by a score of 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, to win the Bedford Cup.
“I got to the finals, felt pretty good,” Wat-
son said. “I knew Moritz Buerchner had tough matches [Sunday]. I decided to play steady and make him work. I knew I could outlast him if it went three sets, and it did go three sets.”
Outlast is exactly what Watson did. After splitting the first two sets, Watson was seem-ingly quicker, stronger and fitter than his op-ponent.
“Once I got my confidence going, it kept 
going and going,” Watson said.
Watson’s momentum started in neither the 
third set of the finals nor the semis. Watson started his march to the finals in the round of 32, when he played No. 3 seed Benjamin Lock of FSU. Watson edged Lock 6-4, 6-4.
“It really boosted my confidence getting 
through the second round, beating Benjamin Lock,” Watson said. “It really lifted my spir -
its.”
What made his performance even more 
eye- opening? The Bedford Cup was only the redshirt freshman’s second time competing in a collegiate tournament.
Watson making an impact as fast as he has 
would have been difficult to imagine when he was signing his letter of intent.
“Being a freshman, it is a great experi-
ence,” Watson said. “I really didn’t expect any of this coming in. It is what it is, and I wouldn’t give it up for the world.”Watson making early impact

Redshirt junior Agata Strausa runs in the 
Mountain Dew Invitational on Saturday morning at the Mark Bostick Golf Course.
CROSS COUNTRY
TAYLOR GAINES

Junior Agata Strausa had never run a race as a 
member of the Gators cross country team before 
her victory at the Mountain Dew Invitational. 
Nonetheless, no one seemed very surprised 
when she came across the line in first.
“Well, we knew she was talented,” coach Paul 
Spangler said. “The girl’s got skills.”
Strausa was born in Riga, Latvia and attended 
school at Hermann-von-Helmholtz in Germany before transferring to Florida in January. The urge to become a part of Gator Nation became too much for her to resist.
“I really wanted to make the American expe-
rience, and I just fell in love with the Gators on my recruit trip,” Strausa said.  
“This is where I want to represent. It’s a great 
team, great coaches — it seemed like the perfect opportunity.”
Her transition to the Orange and Blue hap-
pened quicker than most would have expected. In her first track meet as a Gator in February, she placed 10th in the women’s 3,000 meter. 
No one would have faulted Strausa, who ran 
for a club team in Germany before coming to America, if she had a bit of an adjustment pe-riod. 
After all, she was in a new climate, surround-
ed by new coaches and teammates, living in a different country.
“You’re used to doing things one way and 
now you’ve got a new coach and you’re doing things differently,” Spangler said. “For her to come out here and have a really good race in her first one gives her a lot of confidence in what we’re doing as far as training but also gives her a lot of confidence as we move later into the sea-son.”
Strausa will play an important role moving 
forward as the Gators try to replace Genevieve LaCaze, who graduated this spring and ran for Australia in the Olympics this summer. 
“We want to go to nationals as a team and 
that’s what we are all working to,” Strausa said. “We work really hard and we look really good in practice. We just have to stay healthy.”Strausa wins first race with Florida

Florida is currently second af-
ter balancing its first two rounds 
at the Dale McNamara Invitation-al on Monday.
The Gators shot a 285 (-3) in 
the first round but carded a 291 (+3)  in the second, resulting in a four-stroke deficit to first-place Arizona State after Day 1 of the 15-team tournament.
Strong outings by sophomore 
Camilla Hedberg and senior Isa-belle Lendl helped put the Gators in second place after the Sun Dev-ils posted the day’s lone under-par team score.
Hedberg tied a team low by 
carding a 67 (-5) with four birdies and an eagle against one bogey. 
“Camilla and Isabelle each had 
a great round in the morning and afternoon, respectively,” coach Emily Bastel said. “Those rounds kept us in the golf tournament.”
Lendl ended her first round 
with a 71 (-1), carding four bo-geys. 
She birdied her final three 
holes to close out a promising showing.
She carried the momentum of 
her final three holes of the first round into the second, starting with another three straight bird-ies. 
The senior posted a 67 (-5), in-
cluding seven birdies. 
Lendl’s combined 138 (-6) was 
good for first place on the indi-vidual leaderboard. Hedberg to-taled 140 (-4) on the day, tying her for second with Jayde Panos of Oklahoma State.
In spite of Lendl and Hed-
berg’s strong performances, sup-port from the rest of the Gators was sparse.
“Overall, it wasn’t our best 
day, but we are looking forward to tomorrow and glad we are in the hunt,” Bastel said. 
Senior Mia Piccio posted a 76 
(+4) in Monday’s second round to bring her tourney total to 148 (+4). 
Piccio bo-
geyed two holes and double-bo-geyed another. 
She is currently tied for 20th.
Freshman Ursa Orehek carded 
a 75 (+3) in the second round to bring her two-round total to 155 (+11). 
Sophomore Anna Young fin-
ished the day with a score of 76 (+4) for a two-day total of 151 (+7). 
Young bogeyed on three sep-
arate occasions in the second round and double-bogeyed the sixth hole.
The Gators will pick up play 
today for the third and final round of the invitational. Florida  trails Arizona State by four strokes.
“I am proud of the girls for 
hanging in there on a long 36-hole day,” Bastel said. 
“It is, obviously, physically 
tiring, but even more mentally tiring. But we will be ready to go tomorrow.”Strong showings from

UF tennis player  Josh: The biggest question about Flori-
da entering the season was whether it would have enough effective skill 
players on offense. UF lost Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps at 
the end of 2011 without making any signiﬁ  -cant additions. 
After starting the season 3-0 and putting 
up 555 yards of total offense against Ten-nessee on Saturday, fans have to be feeling pretty good about the team’s playmakers.  
Frankie Hammond Jr., Trey Burton and 
Mike Gillislee all made explosive plays for a team that struggled in that area a year ago.
  Not so fast.  This is still largely the same personnel 
from the 2011 offense, which ﬁ  nished 75th in the country in plays from scrimmage of at least 30 yards. 
Until these players show the same explo-
siveness against one of the better defenses in the Southeastern Conference, there is no reason to believe they can make enough ex-plosive plays for the Gators to contend for an SEC title.
  Adam: Way to ruin the party, Josh.  Sure, the Gators have a quarterback 
with three career starts, a running back who hasn’t played a full season and a rag-tag group of receivers who have never been “playmakers.”
  But this isn’t the Florida team from a 
year ago. 
While John Brantley focused on dump-
ing the football to his running backs in the ﬂ  ats, Jeff Driskel has targeted his receivers and given them a chance.
  Rainey and Demps were responsible for 
19 of 52 receptions through the ﬁ  rst three games of 2011. Gillislee, Florida’s starting running back in 2012, has just one recep-tion.
  “As far as the playmakers (are con-
cerned), we have them. We just have to get the ball out there, get the ball in our hands and we’ll do the rest,” Hammond said. “The play-makers out there just have to get our opportunities and take advantage of them.”
  Florida generat-
ed four plays of more than 20 yards against Tennessee in 2011, all of which Rainey and Demps were responsible for.
  The Gators more than doubled that total 
on Saturday in Knoxville, Tenn., and had ﬁ  ve different players make a play of more than 20 yards.
  This bodes well going forward. The of-
fense isn’t centered around two speed backs that can’t play the north-south style Will Muschamp wants. Distributing the football and playing off the physical running of Gil-lislee is what makes this team go.
  As Muschamp said after Saturday’s 
game, “This is a different 3-0.”
  Josh: Muschamp also said that the 
Gators are, “not where [they] need to be but certainly better than [they] have been.” Even he knows the team still needs to show improvement to be true contenders.
  Sure, Florida has made signiﬁ  cant 
strides, but that doesn’t mean the “play-makers” will still make plays against Geor-gia, Florida State and LSU.
  Trey Burton had the two big touchdown 
runs, but that was as much bad preparation on Tennessee’s part as it was him doing anything right. 
The Vols inexcusably didn’t have either 
edge contained and looked like they might actually be expecting a pass from Burton, who has thrown the ball just 12 times in his career.
  The best defenses in the SEC will not be 
caught ﬂ  at-footed like that.
  Adam: Why not give the Florida offense 
a little bit of credit? Hammond said 
before the season that offensive coor-dinator Brent Pease has brought a more creative system to the Gators. 
This isn’t the one-
look offense Charlie 
Weis ran last year. The redshirt senior re-ceiver said it himself on UF’s media day. 
If Pease is making these players better, 
isn’t that enough? 
Judging from last season, the Gators’ 
playmakers don’t have anywhere to go ex-cept up, and a favorable schedule will help Florida going forward. 
There isn’t the ridiculous October stretch 
this season like there was in 2011, when the Gators played three SEC games against top-10 defenses. 
Florida has four teams on its schedule 
this season that were top-10 defenses in 2011. 
The only true road game against those 
four opponents comes in Tallahassee against Florida State. 
Not only is this a changed team with an 
easier schedule, but these playmakers have gotten better. Whether that’s because of new starting quarterback Jeff Driskel or an improvement of talent remains to be seen, but the numbers don’t lie. 
Florida has the skill players it needs to 
win.
