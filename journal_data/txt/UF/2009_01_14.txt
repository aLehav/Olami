Hialeah among ‘most    
boring cities’ on Forbes list
MIAMI — The Miami sub -
urb of Hialeah has earned a 
dubious distinction: Forbes 
magazine included it among 
one of the 10 most boring cit -
ies in the U.S.
The publication scoured 
news archives to determine 
which of the nation’s 100 larg -
est cities received the fewest 
media mentions in 2008, after 
being adjusted for population 
size.
Joining Hialeah — in no 
particular order — were the 
Phoenix bedroom communi -
ties of Mesa, Chandler and 
Gilbert; the Los Angeles sub -
urb of Santa Ana; and, on the 
outskirts of Las Vegas, North 
Las Vegas and Henderson.
Mayor Julio Robaina 
disputed the findings, say -
ing: “Hialeah has more than 
250,000 people. Obviously 
something is keeping them 
here.”

Firefighters charged with 
using arson to get work
PHOENIX — Four fire -
fighters have been arrested on 
suspicion of igniting between 
15 and 20 fires in western 
Arizona so they could get paid 
for fighting them, officials said 
Tuesday.
Authorities also charged 
two men suspected of setting 
fires to get money from the 
firefighters, and were seeking 
arrest warrants for two former 
firefighters who have moved 
out of state.
The firefighters worked at 
the fire district in Ehrenberg, 
a town of about 1,200 people 
and about 140 miles west 
of Phoenix on the Arizona-
California line. They got $10 
an hour per fire.
The six men arrested are suspected of igniting at least 
15 fires in abandoned trailer 
homes, on open land and in 
expensive haystacks owned by 
farmers between January 2006 
and last week, La Paz County 
sheriff’s Lt. Glenn Gilbert said.
No one was hurt in the fires, 
the most costly of which de -
stroyed a $200,000 haystack.
Gilbert said the firefighters 
admitted to starting the blazes 
to make money and targeted 
haystacks because those types 
of fires can last for days.
The six men arrested Monday, 
all between the ages of 19 and 
25, had their first court appear -
ance Tuesday. They did not yet 
have lawyers.
All six face felony charges 
including arson, conspiracy 
to commit arson, fraudulent 
schemes, burning of wildlands 
and criminal damage.
Gilbert said they face at least 
a decade in prison if convicted 
of the crimes.

Parachuting investor fled 
divorce, investigations
HARPERSVILLE, Ala. — 
With his personal and financial 
worlds crumbling around him, 
investment adviser Marcus 
Schrenker opted for a bailout.
In a feat reminiscent of a 
James Bond movie, the 38-year-
old businessman and amateur 
daredevil pilot apparently tried 
to fake his death in a plane 
crash, secretly parachuting to 
the ground and speeding away 
on a motorcycle he had stashed 
away in the pine barrens of cen -
tral Alabama.
Now the search is on for 
Schrenker, who is running not 
only from the law but from di -
vorce, a state investigation of 
his businesses and angry inves -
tors who accuse him of stealing 
potentially millions in savings 
they entrusted to him.
“We’ve learned over time 
that he’s a pathological liar — 
you don’t believe a single word 
that comes out of his mouth,” 
said Charles Kinney, a 49-year-
old airline pilot from Atlanta 
who alleges Schrenker pocketed 
at least $135,000 of his parents’ 
retirement fund.

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2009  ALLIGATOR , 3
By LAUREN BAKER
Alligator Staff Writer 
Student senators kicked off the 
New Year with a few resolutions of 
their own Tuesday night at the first 
Senate meeting of spring semester.
Talk turned to booze and ciga -
rettes as senators decided to put 
two pieces of legislation on hold 
during the meeting.
One of the resolutions dropped 
from the meeting’s agenda op -
posed the proposed Gainesville 
City Commission ordinance that 
would penalize bars and restau -
rants with excessive underage 
drinking violations by prohibiting 
them from admitting people under 
21 years of age after 9 p.m.
The resolution, which presents 
an opinion but takes no action, 
aimed “to protect students’ night -
life from a long term prospective.”
Senate President Jordan Johnson, 
who sponsored the bill, said the 
legislation was put on hold after he 
learned he was not fully informed 
on the issue.
Johnson said he plans to at -
tend Thursday’s City Commission 
meeting, where the bill will be pre -
sented for first time, to learn fur -
ther details.
“The key thing there is that we 
do have time,” he said. 
Senators also declined to discuss a resolution that encourages the 
passage of a new law by the Florida 
Legislature that would raise the 
state’s cigarette tax by $1.
The resolution states Student 
Senate’s support of the bill and 
similar legislation regarding the in -
creased cigarette fees.
The bill was introduced to 
the Florida Legislature dur -
ing the January Special Session, 
said Orange and Blue Sen. Ben 
Cavataro.
If senators approve the resolu -
tion, copies will be sent to public 
representatives such as Gov. Charlie 
Crist to show Senate’s support of 
the tax increase, Cavataro said.
The increased cigarette tax 
would benefit UF because the mon -
ey generated would help soothe the 
state’s budget woes, Cavataro said.
Senators did approve a resolu -
tion in support of American jobs 
and industry, though some felt it 
went beyond Senate’s ability to do 
so.
“We have no jurisdiction. We 
have no expertise,” said Orange and Blue Party Sen. Sam Miorelli.
Orange and Blue Sen. Mark 
McShera disagreed.
“A lot of people are hurting, and 
we need to pass this bill,“ he said.Earlier in the meeting, senators 
passed legislation declaring Jan. 20, 
2009, as Barack Obama Day.
Members of UF’s Black Student 
Union will carry the resolution with them when they take their SG-
funded trip to the Inauguration, ac -
cording to an SG press release.

A proposed ordinance banning people under 21 years old 
from bars and restaurants that habitually violate underage 
drinking laws might pass at the Gainesville City Commission 
meeting on Thursday.
The Underage Prohibition in Alcohol Beverage 
Establishments Act, if passed on both Thursday and on Feb. 5, 
would ban establishments with a certain number of underage 
drinking arrests from allowing people under 21 years old to 
enter after 9 p.m.
The aim of the ordinance is to lessen the money the city 
spends policing bars.  
In 2008, Gainesville spent $125,000 on bar patrol. In 2007, 
the city spent $75,000, and in 2006, $25,000 was spent. The cost 
increases yearly as police demand more money for overtime.
“We’re spending a disproportionate 
amount of money to patrol bars,” said 
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, head of the commis -
sion’s Public Safety Committee. “It’s really a 
resources issue here.”
The ordinance was proposed last February 
and underwent several drafts before its now-
final form. 
Bars and restaurants  with an occupan -
cy of less than 201 must have fewer than 
five underage drinking arrests in 90 days to avoid penalty. 
Establishments with an occupancy of 201 or more must stay 
under 10 violations in the 90-day period, according to the or -
dinance.
Many bars and restaurants have few violations, so for them 
nothing would change. But bars such as Gator City and XS, 
Grog House and Jewells would have to make drastic policy 
changes to retain their under-21 crowd. 
In the 90-day period between July and September of 2008, 
32 underage drinkers were arrested at Gator City and XS, 
25 were arrested at the Grog House and 25 were arrested at 
Jewells.
Some business owners and students oppose the ordinance. 
Facebook event groups encourage UF students to protest 
outside city hall before the commission meeting Thursday.
One event, started by Gainesville club promoter Joey 
Friedman, had more than 950 members as of Monday night. 
The Facebook page falsely stated that the ordinance will 
prohibit people younger than 21 years old from all Gainesville 
bars and clubs.
Friedman said it’s not about the words, it’s how the ordi -
nance will be enacted.
He believes the city will pick and choose which establish -
ments to inspect under the new ordinance, putting the heat on 
midtown and downtown nightlife.
“They’re not sending police officers into Chili’s to look for 
violators,” he said. “They’re sending them into the bars down -
town.”Students upset 
over proposed 
bar ordinance
 CAMERAS MOUNTED ON LIGHT 
POLES HELPED IN SURVEILLANCE.

What does a couch set on fire by rowdy 
Gators fans after a national championship 
look like through an infrared camera lens?
“Pretty cool,” according to Gainesville 
City Commissioner and UF’s Assistant 
Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanna 
Mastrodicasa.
Mastrodicasa said she watched live video 
of the burning couch at the Gainesville Police 
Department headquarters, 721 N.W. Sixth St., 
during the celebration on University Avenue 
after Thursday’s game.
The video was streaming in from a police helicopter hovering over the mob of 28,000 for 
about three and a half hours, directing officers 
to trouble spots like the burning couch.
But that wasn’t the only video feed officers 
were watching Thursday night.
For the first time, GPD was receiving video 
from cameras installed on traffic light poles at 
University Avenue intersections.
The cameras were installed as part of the 
city’s $18.2 million plan to manage traffic by 
monitoring major intersections and adjusting 
the timing of traffic lights.
UF has committed about $3.8 million to the 
project.
There are currently about 40 cameras 
around Alachua County , with plans to install 
a total of about 85, city spokesman Bob Woods 
said.
Mastrodicasa said the cameras allowed her 
to watch fans climbing light poles and said she 
even witnessed one fan strike an officer.The fan, UF student Cynthia M. Santos, was 
arrested for battery on a law enforcement offi -
cer and resisting an officer without violence, 
according to the arrest report.
Summer Hallett, GPD spokeswoman, said 
the cameras helped the department control the 
crowd more effectively and were one reason 
officials were able to prevent another trag -
edy like the death of Lt. Corey 
Dahlem, who was hit and killed 
by a drunken driver after UF’s 
second basketball champion -
ship in 2007.
“When you’re in the crowd, it’s hard to see 
what’s going on,” she said. 
“(The cameras) gave us, basically, a 360 de -
gree view,” she said.
Hallett said GPD plans to use the cameras 
for crowd control whenever there’s a big event, 
like a parade or a celebration. She said the de -
partment could even use them in the case of an active shooter on or near the UF campus.
Another tool the city used to keep fans safe 
during the celebration was a little more low-
tech — Pam cooking spray.
Gina Hawkins, spokeswoman for the city’s 
Public Works Department, said 10 cans of the 
spray were used on a total of 10 traffic light 
poles to keep fans from climbing them.
Hawkins said Gainesville began using the 
spray after the basketball championship in 
2007, making this year the second time the 
spray was employed.
“For us, the convenience of Pam is that it’s 
in the spray form,” Hawkins said. “And it’s 
edible.”
Which would be a benefit if fans tried to eat 
the stuff, she said.
“You never know what to expect from your 
fans,” she said.
It’s even OK for those on a low-cholesterol 
diet, she joked.After BCS win, cameras, cooking spray aid local policeBy JENA ADDISON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Thanks to Tim Tebow’s announce -
ment Sunday that he will be returning 
to UF next year, local organizations 
may see a boost in volunteers.
In an effort to convince Tebow to 
stay at UF for his senior season, about 
50 Gators fans pledged to volunteer 
in 2009 at www.DontGoTebow.com, a 
Web site launched Jan. 2.
Kristen Soltis, a UF alumna now 
working in Washington, D.C., created 
the Web site after she heard that one 
reason Tebow was considering the NFL 
was to have more time for community 
service and mission trips.
“He is just one person, and one 
person can only do so much,” Soltis 
said. “But we’ve got the whole Gator 
Nation.”
Because Tebow’s announcement came so early, the Web site’s purpose 
has become more of a “thank you” 
than a “don’t go,” she said. 
More than 175 hours a month have 
been pledged, which tallies up to more 
than 2,000 hours for the year, according 
to the Web site. Some members have 
pledged as many as 40 hours.
“I think it says two big things,” 
Soltis said. “First, Tebow’s impact has 
been enormous, and people under -
stand that volunteering is important to 
him and to the community.”The Web site includes a pledge 
form where Gators fans can enter their 
names, e-mail addresses, where they 
would like to volunteer and how many 
hours a month they can commit.
Soltis said she plans to e-mail every -
one with suggestions on where they 
might want to volunteer.
Although it is unclear if everyone 
will follow through with his or her 
pledge, Brandon Crone is not taking 
his own commitment lightly.
Crone, a UF aerospace engineer -
ing junior, was among the first to join 
and submit his pledge to the Facebook 
group that later spawned the Web site.
He pledged to volunteer one hour 
for each touchdown Tebow scored this 
season. Crone mentioned Relay for Life 
and Habitat for Humanity as possible 
volunteering options.
“I gave my word, and there’s really 
no maximum,” he said.Fans pledge to volunteer for Tebow
“He is just one person, and 
one person can only do so 
much. But we’ve got the 
whole Gator Nation.”

NewsLocalA 19-year-old man was arrested after 
being accused of threatening to shoot 
someone in the head during a drug deal 
Monday.
Officers from the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office were dispatched to 1803 
S.W. 69th Terrace when they received 
a call about an armed disturbance be -
tween two men.
ASO spokesman Steve Maynard 
said the victim, Keith Small, was able 
to identify the man as Courtney Crosby, 
19, of Gainesville. 
Maynard said that ASO officers have 
dealt with Crosby in previous drug-
related cases.
Small told officers that Crosby came 
to his residence to collect $45 that Small 
owed him for marijuana, Maynard 
said.
When Small didn’t give him the 
money, Crosby took out a gun and 
threatened to shoot him. 
The officers then surrounded 
Crosby’s residence at 1949 S.W. 69th Drive, where they found him and 10 
marijuana plants inside, the report stat -
ed.
A 9 mm semiautomatic handgun was 
found in the backyard of the house, but 
the second handgun was not found. 
Crosby was charged with aggravat -
ed assault with a deadly weapon and 
destroying or tampering evidence, both 
felonies. 
Threatening with guns is very com -
mon in the drug community, Maynard 
said.
“Last year, almost all of the homi -
cides in Alachua County were drug-
related,” he said.

STEALING $10.96 IN CLOTHING.
A Gainesville woman was arrested 
Monday after being accused of steal -
ing from the Salvation Army thrift store 
where she was performing community 
service hours.
Latonya Jackson, 19, put several cloth -
ing items in her purse that totaled $10.96, 
according to a Gainesville Police report.
During her shift, it was brought to 
the manager’s attention that Jackson was 
taking clothes from the store and putting 
them in her purse, the report stated.When it was time for her to leave, the 
manager confronted Jackson and found 
three shirts and a pair of jeans inside her 
purse, the report stated.
According to the report, 
when the officers con -
fronted her, Jackson told 
police she planned to take 
the clothes out of the store 
without paying for them, but she said 
that someone else was making her do it.
Jackson was charged with petty 
theft and was being held at the Alachua 
County Jail as of Tuesday afternoon.

New ordinance won’t dry 
up Gainesville overnight
Making an informed decision can often spell the 
difference between strutting your stuff to class 
in a pair of oh-so-tight Sevens or having to hide 
your face as you duck into the nearest Lane Bryant.
Did you really have to supersize your latest extra-value 
meal?
As college students, we face, on a daily basis, a litany of 
life-or-death choices that will ultimately shape the course of our very existence. 
Though a Facebook event invitation usually ranges 
from some run-of-the-mill guest speaker to this semester’s 
Great Underwear Dash, there is that rare instance where 
we recommend you take a second look at what’s really at 
stake before making a decision.
Sadly, almost 1,000 (and counting) of you failed to read 
between the lines.
When word hit your laptop during class this week, 
screaming about a new ordinance that bans coeds under 21 from enjoying the Gainesville nightlife, you probably 
freaked out and quickly accepted the invite to join the 
fight against city hall. 
Oh no — what will we do about our socials and grab-a-
dates? At least you can take solace in the fact you made it 
past drop/add before blowing that New Year’s resolution 
to refrain from Facebook during lecture.          
The Editorial Board wants you to take a seat and relax 
before you start heading down I-75 to scout out the Ocala 
nightlife to quench your underage drinking needs. 
The passage of Ordinance 0-07-121 won’t exactly turn 
Gainesville into Florida’s answer to Salt Lake City over -
night. If passed, the ordinance would give the local clubs and bars the opportunity to shape up before prohibiting them from letting in minors.
Even so, establishments that collect an excessive amount 
of violations will only be prohibited from admitting those 
under 21 during the hours of 9 p.m. through 2 a.m. We 
want you to know the proposed legislation has much more 
to do with finding a remedy for the flailing economy than 
keeping underage students from hitting up their favorite watering holes.
Take a look around Gainesville, and we bet you can’t 
drive a block on University Avenue without coming across 
an abandoned or empty storefront. 
The harsh realities of failed Bush economic policy have 
hit North Central Florida — leading our local legislators to scour over the budget in search of potential cutbacks.
The answer? Scaling down the number of Party Patrol 
officers roaming around Midtown in search of 20-year-old 
frat boys double-fisting whatever Vincent Chase drank 
that week on Entourage. 
The city’s issue with Party Patrol officers stems from 
having to pay them time and a half for their services — 
quickly adding up to some serious pocket change.
The Editorial Board understands you may have been 
tricked into believing come Feb. 5 you won’t be able to buy your crush from Econ. an appletini at The Swamp and 
ended up smothering her to make up for lost time. 
We sympathize — but don’t make us feel like your par -
ents when we tell you to take the time to read things over, 
even Facebook, before jumping to conclusions.
Even if your favorite destination of self-destruction 
ends up banning underage Gators, it doesn’t mean you 
can’t grab dinner there when your family comes to town. 
But, hey, who goes to the bars for the food anyway?
As the dawn of the Age of Obama approaches, 
the president-elect is moving to distance him-self from the former president as quickly and 
easily as possible. What better way to spend his first day in office than by closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, which for so long has been a symbol of the ongoing war on terror?
It won’t be a simple case of pulling the plug and ship-
ping everybody off on their merry way, though. Even though Obama has promised to move quickly, the legal framework of the action will probably take months to work out, especially the logistics of figuring out where 
to put all of the detainees.
While some are screaming, and have been for some 
time, for the closure of the Guantanamo prison, others 
are stuck wondering what will become of the approxi-
mately 250 detainees who are still there — too many of 
whom have been held for years without trial. 
Some may end up in far-off prisons in Portugal, and 
others might receive all-expenses-paid vacations to de-tention centers throughout the rest of Europe.
But what about the Geneva Conventions? And, lest 
we forget, habeas corpus?
Those hardly seem to matter when you look at the 
grand scheme of things. The men have a place to sleep, 
and they get fed. Isn’t that enough? 
Maybe we’ll hear more claims of Obama pallin’ 
around with terrorists because of his decision, even 
though Sen. John McCain proposed the same exact thing. But how terrifying can these so-called terrorists 
be?
Any glimpses we get into the world of the 
Guantanamo prison show subdued men either walking from one place to another or lean-
ing up against fences. They cer -
tainly don‘t seem like murderous 
masterminds, but that may just be 
a part of their clever ruse to trick us into caring for them as human beings.
One of the detainees consid-
ered to be among the most dan-gerous is said to have trained in 
the fine art of making detonators out of Sega game car -
tridges. Put this man on trial at once, I say! 
Anybody willing to do something so heinous as to 
use relics of our childhood against us deserves to be prosecuted to the fullest. If his little terrorist buddies are as bad as he is, Guantanamo must be a horrid place 
indeed.
Lawyers for these detainees have stated that the gov-
ernment simply will not be able to justify the detention 
of many of the men held there. 
If these detainees are offered trials, will they prove 
what has been feared for quite some time, and will these men be free to go?
In a move straight out of an old Western, have the 
good guys in white rounded up the local gang — only 
to find out that those rounded up had no business being 
behind bars?
It seems that only time will tell. Until then, maybe 
we should bake them a cake with a file in it. As for what will be done to the prison once it is closed, well, perhaps 
Cuba could use an amusement park.

Letters to the Editor
Activists transcend “hippie” image
In response to Yoav Mor’s Monday letter 
to the editor titled “Gainesville lacks informed 
intellectuals,” I was one of those ill-informed 
“hippies” he was referring to — though hu -
man rights activist is a far more accurate term. 
As a matter of fact, those ill-informed hippies 
he was referring to are graduating this semes -
ter with their bachelor’s degrees in Middle 
Eastern Studies. 
I would like to clarify that aside from the 
sign comparing Gaza to Warsaw all other 
posters were merely calling for a stoppage to 
the killings and for people to stand up against 
injustice.  
To console Mor’s “pain” and “sadness” 
about the news of Gaza reaching the UF cam -
pus, he should be relieved to know that he is 
surrounded by human beings who can’t sit 
back and watch hundreds upon hundreds of innocent civilians being slaughtered in the 
name of national security . 
Our ears are far from deaf sir, they are ring -
ing from the cries of the Middle East and our 
voices are all we have right now to speak up 
against the inhumanity and inform the public 
of the current situation. 
When did it become OK to sit back in si -
lence during such a catastrophe, especially 
when people are injured and dying without 
medical aid or food? It’s not OK! 
As a citizen of the world, Mor should take 
part in the discussions of his peers and not ar -
rogantly dismiss them. Question them with 
respect and conclude, not with answers, but 
with a new-found motivation to make a posi -
tive difference.

 Israel ousting Hamas helps Palestinians
Peter Nazzal missed a fundamental 
point in his Tuesday letter to the editor titled 
“Palestinian supporters not ignorant, should 
speak up,” by failing to acknowledge that by 
ousting Hamas from power in Gaza, Israel is 
helping the Palestinian people. 
Nazzal seems to forget that in the summer 
of 2005, Israel unilaterally pulled out every last 
settler and soldier from the Gaza Strip.  This 
ended checkpoints and gave the Palestinians 
an opportunity to behave themselves — pav -
ing the way for full control of their borders 
and an eventual peace agreement.
Rather than take the withdrawal as a sign 
of good will, the rockets began raining down 
on Israeli border towns in higher numbers and 
from closer range than before, causing a mil -lion and a half Israelis to constantly keep one 
eye on the nearest bomb shelter.  
The rocket barrages only increased after 
Hamas rose to power, which then led to the 
Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.
It’s very simple — if Hamas renounces 
violence and recognizes the right of the Jewish 
people to live in their own state in their an -
cestral homeland, peace would be within the 
Palestinians’ grasp. 
Hamas might also be of help to the 
Palestinians if, instead of raiding humanitar -
ian aid convoys and selling the goods for a 
higher price in order to buy more weapons, 
they let the aid get to the people who actually 
need it.
David Drescher
UF alumnus 
So begins another chapter of the 
Middle East conflict.
Arguments on both sides 
continue with no answers. Who 
broke the cease-fire? What violence 
is in self-defense, and what is blatant 
aggression? 
Israel has the right to defend its 
citizens from constant rocket fire 
and terrorism from Hamas, just as 
the Palestinian people need strong 
and progressive leadership to im -
prove their situation. Unfortunately, 
they have found that hope in the 
wrong party. Their tactics, mimick -
ing those used by Hezbollah in 2006, 
turned the entire region into a war 
zone. This ultimately subjected the 
Palestinians in Gaza to terrible con -
ditions — especially compared to the Palestinians in the West Bank.
The basic principle of the Hamas 
organization is the invalidation of 
Israel and its eventual destruction. 
Creating a cease-fire with Israel is in -
congruous with these basic beliefs, let 
alone working toward establishing a 
lasting peace. Conversely, Fatah, the 
more moderate Palestinian party in 
the West Bank, has begun talks with 
Israel to establish peace.
Hamas strategically places the 
locations of its strongholds and arse -
nals in hospitals, mosques and resi -
dential buildings. This despicable act 
creates a game of chicken with Israel 
to see who will act first. Will Israel 
attack strategic Hamas militant tar -
gets despite the potential of civilian 
casualties, or will Hamas continue its use of 
human 
shields 
despite 
putting 
fellow Palestinians in danger?
Comparing the Israeli and 
Palestinian casualties, it is unclear 
how many in Gaza were Hamas 
militants and how many were ci -
vilians in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. The number of civilian 
Palestinian casualties is troubling 
and heart-wrenching, especially 
considering they may have received 
little assistance and warning from 
their governing party . When these 
deaths are reported, the media of -
ten show videos of Israeli rockets 
shooting into civilian complexes, killing dozens of innocent people. 
What’s left unreported is the inten -
tional stockpile of Hamas’ weapons 
hidden within the building, leaving 
few choices for Israel after repeated 
warnings to the residents.
The Israel Defense Forces use 
extensive intelligence before taking 
military action. Israel drops fliers 
and makes phone calls into the ter -
ritories, warning Gazans of the dan -
ger that Hamas has put them in. 
Meanwhile, Hamas continues to 
shoot rockets indiscriminately into 
southern Israel, giving Israelis no 
warning and putting the citizens of 
major cities in a state of constant fear 
and shock. The residents of Sderot 
have 15 seconds from the sound of 
the sirens to run into shelters and pray for safety. Firing these rockets 
isn’t an innocent act of protest, but 
rather a deadly and destructive dis -
play of radicalism.
I urge you to read between the 
lines and understand the intentions 
and strategies used by both actors. 
Israel uses powerful force and ex -
tensive intelligence to remove the 
terrorist threat with the smallest ci -
vilian casualty margin. 
My hopes are that the Palestinian 
people see the danger and destruc -
tion incurred under Hamas and that 
they choose a more legitimate and 
moderate path leading them toward 
a sustainable life and peace with 
their neighbors.

The idea that UF (1-0) would put 
up eight touchdowns against Hawaii  
(0-1) wasn’t all that far-fetched, but 
doing so while quarterback Tim 
Tebow scored just once didn’t seem 
quite right.
The Heisman Trophy winner didn’t 
have to exert much energy in the No. 5 Gators’ 56-10 win Saturday, mostly 
thanks to contributions from seven 
other players that seemed to come 
straight out of a highlight video.
Electrifying runs, solid special 
teams play and ball-hawking defense 
kept the crowd of 90,575 in the Swamp 
on its feet and made a lackluster first 
quarter nothing but an afterthought. 
Tebow barely broke a sweat.
“I didn’t take too much of a pound -
ing,” Tebow said. 
“I don’t think I’m sore, so I can go condition now. I didn’t take too many 
hits.”
Now a fresh Tebow and the rest 
of the his team turn their attention to 
Miami, which comes to Gainesville 
on Saturday.
The fire was already evident in 
Tebow’s eyes right after the Hawaii 
game. The junior signal caller was 
9-of-14 passing for 137 yards and a 
touchdown — a 48-yarder to Louis 
Murphy — and carried nine times for 
37 yards.Tebow scores just once vs. Warriors

It wasn’t the first time that “SEC” 
chants rained down onto Florida 
Field. But this time, there was some -
thing different about them. 
This time, they seemed to be 
rhythmic sighs of relief, rather than a 
celebration of inter-conference domi -
nance. Under the bright lights of Ben 
Hill Griffin Stadium, with a Skycam 
overhead, ESPN’s College GameDay 
crew in attendance and the specter 
of six past losses hanging over them, 
UF (2-0) escaped with a 26-3 victory  
against Miami (1-1) that was closer 
than any score sheet would indicate. 
Offensive lineman Mike Pouncey 
high-fived a fan in the first row, 
thanking the young lad for his sup -
port. Cornerback Joe Haden earned a peck on the cheek from a young lady 
clad in orange, thanking him for his 
performance.
A fan farther back in the stands 
held up a sign that read “Superman 
Fears No Cane,” and while that may 
be true, the Hurricanes appeared to 
be armed with a bit more Kryptonite 
than Tim Tebow had been accus -
tomed to.
UF’s lead was just 6 points going 
into the fourth quarter.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — One hundred thousand orange 
T-shirts, and they were all in the wrong hue.
No. 4 UF’s game against Tennessee was a laugher 
11 minutes in, and the crowd in a filled-to-the-rafters 
Neyland Stadium had nothing to cheer about after the 
player introductions.
It was 17-0 so fast, the fans didn’t know what to do 
with themselves.The Gators (3-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) carried 
that momentum with them for the rest of the game, claim -
ing a 30-6 victory against the Volunteers (1-2).
After Brandon James’ 78-yard punt return for a touch -
down late in the first quarter, no amount of singing 
“Rocky Top” was going to bring the Volunteers back into 
the game.
“It just kind of takes the crowd out of it,” UF coach 
Urban Meyer said of the return. “I’m starting to like this 
team a little bit. 
“I’m not going to say a lot, but I like this team a little 
bit because they know how to practice and are acting very 
mature right now.”Vols fans silenced by punt-return TD

There were 41 seconds left, and 
Jeremy Foley didn’t want to watch 
anymore.
That’s when UF’s athletics director 
turned away from a team that couldn’t 
advance the football 3 feet. A team 
that was less than one minute from 
witnessing giddy Mississippi players flocking to photographers and do -
ing dances that would make Michael 
Jackson blush. 
A team whose hopes for an un -
blemished season vanished like the 
orange-and-blue-clad fans did from 
The Swamp. 
A team that now has a serious iden -
tity crisis. 
Now it’s time to page Dr. Tebow for 
help, and this is going to require more 
minute cuts than what he did over the summer when he gave circumcisions 
to Filipino babies. 
Because it’s certainly not easy to 
help 120 other sweat-drenched foot -
ball players who were refusing to take 
off their pads as they sat in a hushed 
locker room.
“It was so quiet you could hear 
a pin drop,” cornerback Joe Haden 
said after UF’s (3-1, 1-1 Southeastern 
Conference) humbling 31–30 loss 
against Mississippi (3-2) on Saturday.Future in doubt after loss to RebelsHAWAII 10 UF 56

 FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Let’s forget 
about numbers for a second.
Put aside the season-high 514 yards the 
Gators (4-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) 
racked up in a 38-7 win against Arkansas 
(2-3) on Saturday and wipe away the long 
touchdown runs by Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps in the final minutes that turned an unimpressive win into a rout. 
And erase the notion that this was a 
bounce-back statement for No. 11 UF after last week’s stunning loss to Mississippi. That upset was a wake-up call for the Gators, and it appears they groggily hit the snooze button Saturday.
“I don’t think we played a great game,” 
coach Urban Meyer said. “Obviously, that’s very far from a finished product, but 
that’s what happens in college football.”
The offense went the way of the weath-
er in Razorback Stadium — fluctuating 
between warm and chilly . 
The Gators chewed up yards and 
moved across the field with the consisten-cy of a lawn mower on some drives, but on others, penalties and poor execution left them stagnant. Season back on track

 JACKSONVILLE — Forget the “Gator 
Stomp,” this was the Gator Romp.
As expected, UF (7-1, 5-1 Southeastern 
Conference) delivered a response to 
Georgia’s end-zone celebration in 2007, 
only the Gators didn’t party in the end 
zone during their 49-10 whipping of the Bulldogs (7-2).
The whole field was their dance hall.Cornerback Joe Haden pulled a nifty 
two-step at Georgia’s 25-yard line, pro-longing his 88-yard interception return that gift-wrapped a 1-yard touchdown 
scamper for quarterback Tim Tebow.
Defensive tackle Terron Sanders pirou-
etted around would-be Bulldog tacklers af-
ter scooping up a fumble by running back Knowshon Moreno, returning the ball to the 10-yard line to set up another Tebow score.
Linebacker Brandon Spikes balled him-
self up and rolled like he was on fire after being blocked in the fourth quarter. It was one of the few times the junior didn’t find his target in the Georgia (7-2) backfield, 
but it didn’t matter at that point. He had 
already done enough to secure a victory.
For the finale, Tebow enjoyed the night’s 
last dance, a slow one, as he took a long victory lap around Jacksonville Municipal Stadium.  By PHIL KEGLER

 The Swamp Swagger is back.
From Mississippi Melancholy to Tiger 
Triumph.
In a contest it had to have to stay in the 
national title picture, UF did not just win a football game.
With the nation watching, the Gators 
(5-1, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) made a statement.
They handed Les Miles his worst loss 
since coming to Baton Rouge and hung more than half-a-hundred on LSU (4-1) for only the fifth time since the inception of the Southeastern Conference in 1933.
The 51-21 thrashing brought the believers 
back, as UF rose to No. 5 in the Associated Press poll released Sunday and jumped into a three-way tie atop the SEC East with 10th-ranked Georgia and No. 22 Vanderbilt. Now talk will return to where it was pre-season: a possible trip to Miami, site of the BCS National Championship Game.
The stable of undefeated teams in BCS 
conferences has dwindled to five occupants, including possible SEC Championship op-ponent No. 2 Alabama.
For now, the national analysts will con-
tinue to heap love on the three Big 12 un-beatens.
But after a game like this, UF will take 
on all comers. Tigers sent packing early

 Let the countdown to Jacksonville be-
gin.
After a 63-5 flattening of Kentucky 
on Saturday afternoon, No. 5 UF has its 
sights set firmly on its game with No. 8 Georgia this weekend.
The Wildcats (5-3) offered little resis-
tance as the Gators (6-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) put up 28 points in the first quarter and never looked back.
In the post-game press conference, 
questions focused more on the Georgia 
contest than the one UF had just com-
pleted.
It was clear players had been instruct-
ed not to talk about the Georgia game, specifically about the now-infamous 
touchdown celebration the Bulldogs per-
formed after their first score in last year’s 
game, which they went on to win 42-30.
After a 1-yard touchdown by run-
ning back Knowshon Moreno, the Georgia sideline emptied, and the play-
ers stomped on the field in front of the 
Gators.
Linebacker Brandon Spikes, for ex-
ample, responded with four straight “no 
comments” when asked about the cel-
ebration.
Wide receiver Percy Harvin was the 
only player who came close to talking 
about it.
“We plan on putting points on the 
board, so we don’t need that,” Harvin said.

Ever since Steve Spurrier took over 
UF’s football program in 1990, the Gators 
have been among the nation’s best college 
football teams, winning three titles in the 
last 13 seasons and two of the past three.
UF’s 1996, 2006 and 2008 championship 
teams were all immensely talented, but the difference between this year’s squad and 
the others was luck.
The 1996 team needed late losses by 
other title contenders to open the 
door for a championship, and it 
took several close shaves and a 
huge blocked kick for the 2006 
Gators to make the BCS title 
game.
This season, UF made its own 
good fortune after a shocking home loss 
to Mississippi in September, and the way the Gators responded to that loss prompted 
a heaping of praise from UF coach Urban 
Meyer.
“That was one of the best 
football teams I’ve ever had the 
privilege to be around, certain -
ly one of the best,” Meyer said. 
“I’ve been a coach now for 23-
some years, and I have to rank 
this either 1 or 1A as far as quality 
of people and as far as work ethic.”
Perhaps more importantly than where this team ranks in the history of UF football 
is what effect it will have on future teams.
With the way the Gators bonded during 
the season and the large number of players 
who will return next season, UF is poised 
to stay atop the college football landscape 
for another few years.
“I’m not sure what the word ‘dynasty’ 
means, but I’m very confident now,” Meyer 
said. “I see some good players, and I see a 
program that’s set now. We’re good, and I 
didn’t feel that way two years ago.”Who’s the Best?
20081996
200612-1 (8-0 SEC)
Bowl Win: Defeated FSU in the Sugar Bowl 52-20
Star Players: Quarterback Danny Wuerffel, Running 
back Fred Taylor, Safety Lawrence Wright
Road to No. 1:  UF was in the top five all season and 
held the No. 1 spot for nine weeks before a loss to rival 
FSU in its final regular-season game threatened to de -
rail its season. It took an Southeastern Conference title 
win for UF, a loss in the Big 12 Championship from 
Nebraska and undefeated Arizona State’s loss in the 
Rose Bowl to make UF the national champion after it 
stomped FSU in a bowl-game rematch.
Defining Moment: Nothing could be sweeter than steam -
rolling a hated rival to win a national title, and the Gators’ 
demolition of No. 1 FSU will be hard to top as the best game in UF history.
What You Might Not Know: The 1996 team is remembered as a dominant team, and it was, outscoring opponents 
611-221, but it essentially took a miracle for the Gators to win a national title. All the cards had to fall just right after 
the Gators’ late loss to the Seminoles, and the school’s first championship had a lot to do with some lucky breaks.
13-1 (7-1 SEC)
Bowl Win: Thumped Ohio State in the BCS Championship Game 41-14
Star Players:  Quarterback Chris Leak, Receiver Percy Harvin, Safety Reggie 
Nelson
Road to No. 1: Florida started the year at No. 7, and a win against LSU at home 
vaulted the Gators to the No. 2 spot. But it wouldn’t last long, as they dropped 
their next game to Auburn 27-17. UF’s next three games were decided by 7, 6 and 
1 points, as the team needed a late field goal block to squeak by South Carolina 
at home. But the Gators shed their penchant for close games by cruising past the 
heavily favored Buckeyes for the BCS title.
Defining Moment: A few fingers made all the difference in the Gators’ title run, as 
defensive end Jarvis Moss blocked a 48-yard, potential game-winning field goal 
as time expired to seat UF’s 17-16 win against South Carolina.
What You Might Not Know:  The Gators’ defense held opponents to 189 points 
(13.5 per game), the lowest average since UF’s 1983 team, and while the lasting 
image of the team is of it blowing Ohio State away, defense was the key all sea -
son.
13-1 (7-1 SEC)
Bowl Win:  Topped Oklahoma in the BCS Championship Game 24-14
Star Players:  Quarterback Tim Tebow, 
Receiver Percy Harvin, Linebacker Brandon 
Spikes
Road to No. 1: UF stumbled early with a 
31-30 loss to Mississippi in the fourth game, 
but the Gators went on a tear after that, out -
scoring their opponents 414-97 through the 
rest of the regular season. They didn’t reach 
the top ranking until after a 31-20 win against 
Alabama for the SEC championship, but with 
their level of play following the loss to the 
Rebels, the Gators were clearly the nation’s 
best team for most of the season.
Defining Moment: Following Mississippi’s 
gift-wrapped upset in The Swamp, UF quar -
terback Tim Tebow apologized to fans and promised the team would work harder than any squad ever had, and it’s 
hard to argue with the results following his promise.
What You Might Not Know: Following the loss, the Gators won each of their next eight games by 28 points or 
more, becoming the first major college football team to do so since Minnesota in 1903.Season Statistics

It didn’t look like he was going to make the top of our list early in the season, but for the 
second year in a row, Tebow is the alligatorSports Player of the Year. In a comeback — which he proved during the season he could accomplish — Tebow moved up the rankings as the year went on with his amazing performances on the field. He led the UF offense to 
10 straight wins to cap off the season, and even though he didn’t win the Heisman, his per -
formances late in the Southeastern Conference Championship and BCS National Champi-
onship games brought back memories of his Heisman campaign in 2007. When Tebow an-nounced Sunday he would return for his senior season, the rest of the SEC must have been 
very upset. He staked his claim to next season’s SEC championship, and he might be laying 
down a senior season that cements his legacy as the greatest college football player ever.

If Harvin hadn’t missed the Hawaii and Ala -
bama games, he might have challenged Tebow 
for this award. Instead, Harvin merely became the most feared offensive weapon in the coun -
try, forcing opponents to double-team him even in situations when the ball wasn’t anywhere near him. Harvin’s ability to break open a run or pass at any time changed games more than once this year, and coach Urban Meyer fre-quently says the junior has the fastest first step 
in football. With the way he blows by defend -
ers in the blink of an eye, we don’t doubt it.
70 rushes, 660 yards, 10 TDs; 40 catches, 644

Spikes had several memorable plays this season that swung games in UF’s favor, including his early tackle of Knowshon Moreno in the Georgia game and his interception returned for a touch-down against LSU. Spikes almost always led 
the team in tackles, but his leadership in the 
locker room united a defense that came into 
the season underestimated and not at all 
feared. Everyone is afraid of the UF defense 
now, and if Spikes returns to anchor it for next season, opponents better watch out.

POSITION GRADES
In 2006, the Urban renewal was complete. In 2008, Meyer took his place as one of the best coaches in college football. 
He is the first coach to win two BCS Championships, and his recruiting abilities are bringing young talent into Gainesville year after year. Meyer also put together a phenomenal staff this season, bringing Kenny Carter in to coach running backs, Dan McCarney to mold the defensive line and Vance Bedford to school the cornerbacks and mesh with the rest of his coaches. Combine all of them with offensive coordinator Dan Mullen, who went from hated to loved in two months flat, and defensive coordinator Charlie Strong, and Meyer might be right when he says he has the best staff in the nation.Eleven interceptions in 2007 to 26 this sea-son. Stats don’t tell everything, but that one does. The improved secondary is perhaps the biggest reason why the Gators turned it around this year. The youth of Major Wright and Joe Haden turned into sound experience while Janoris Jenkins and Ahmad Black were the surprises of the season. Other Southeastern Conference teams should be very upset 
that there are no upperclassmen in this group.Urban Meyer got downright giddy about his 
special teams at some points this season. Caleb Sturgis struggled on kickoffs at first, and Brandon James and the return game couldn’t get many big returns late in the year. That’s just being nitpicky, though. Any coach would love to have UF’s speed on his blocking units, and James is still capable of a big return every time he has the ball. Then consider that Chas Henry is becoming one of the nation’s best 
punters and Jonathan Phillips only missed one field goal all year — this is an impressive group.What a slacker. Could Tim Tebow be any more lazy? He’s such a jerk who has a horrible influence on his teammates and 
shouldn’t be looked up to by anybody. 
We’re surprised Urban Meyer hasn’t benched him yet. As you can see, we’re a fan of sarcasm here at alli -
gatorSports. Listen, statistically, 2007 Tebow was better 
than 2008. But we’re smart enough to realize Tebow’s 
impact goes far beyond the stats. It’s hard to see an-other player in sports who influences teammates as 
much as Tebow does. He’s one of the all-time greats, 
and he’s still got one more year.
Percy Harvin missed games. Louis Murphy didn’t have the stats most thought he would. Deonte Thompson was inconsis-
tent. So enter David Nelson, Riley Cooper 
and Aaron Hernandez with an occasional cameo by 
Carl Moore . All of these guys made big plays through -
out the year — blocking and catching — and made Tebow’s life much easier whenever Harvin was out. 
And then, when the likes of Murphy and Harvin did 
have their A games — watch out.
This group has scary potential, and they showed a lot of glimpses this year. Carlos Dunlap and Jermaine Cunning-ham combined for 23.5 sacks, and the Gators’ toughness on the line was immeasurably bet-ter than it was a year ago. The addition of defensive line coach Dan McCarney has helped the likes of Law-rence Marsh, Terron Sanders and Justin Trattou start to 
find their potential, and it’s making life very hard for 
opposing running backs and quarterbacks.They had their off days (see the national title 
game), and then Jeff Demps and Chris Rain-ey had days when it looked like they were 
playing Pop Warner football. UF may very 
well be the fastest team in the nation thanks to this young duo, and not to mention they don’t fumble it away.Let’s also give a shout-out to Kestahn Moore for leading 
this group and being one of the most unselfish players UF 
has seen in a long time. It’s too hard to ignore all the posi-
tives of this group, and frankly, there aren’t many nega-
tives.
Besides Jim Tartt being in and out of the 
lineup, this group had the same guys 
starting up front every game, and it paid 
dividends. Tebow had time to throw, and Demps, Rainey and Harvin had holes to run through. 
These guys don’t get much love, but they should. They 
outplayed Alabama’s and Oklahoma’s lines when they 
matched up, and those were thought to be the best 
two in the country. Not bad, fellas.
He came, saw and conquered. One of the best linebackers in the nation this year, Brandon Spikes didn’t have an off-game and was the emotional leader of the defense. From having his dreads bounce up and down before the game to knocking the snot out of Knowshon Moreno against Georgia, Spikes was as good as advertised this season. Also, Ryan Stamper, A.J. Jones, Brandon Hicks 
and Dustin Doe are already a good group by them-
selves. With Spikes, they were one of the best around.POSITION GRADES

UF MEN’S BASKETBALL
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
It’s Nov. 22, 1996, and the final 
buzzer sounds on UF’s  80-63 win 
against Central Florida.
First-year coach Billy Donovan 
walks down the court, hugging 
assistants and shaking hands, 
his jet-black hair having not yet 
given way to wisps of gray.
The banners hanging from the 
ceiling of the O’Connell Center 
were then just a dream — the 
lines on the 30-year-old’s resume 
still waiting to be filled. 
When the Gators take the floor 
in Auburn tonight, Donovan will 
be a long way away from that first 
victory in orange and blue. He’ll be going for win No. 300 at UF.
Donovan passed Norm Sloan 
(235) as UF’s all-time leader in 
coaching wins two seasons ago.
But like most things in life, 
nothing seems quite like the first 
time around.
“In today’s day and age of 
coaching, it is really hard to stay 
at a place for a long period of 
time,” Donovan said. 
“I think when you see that 
number there, it takes me back to 
when it first started and believ -
ing in those guys. That changed 
me as a coach.”
Donovan had just taken over 
a program that had only won 12 
games the year before, and the 
talent pool was a far cry from the 
Mike Millers, David Lees and Al Horfords of the coming years.
The Gators won 13 games in 
Donovan’s first season.
“We were not the most tal -
ented group, 
but they played 
really hard and 
gave me every -
thing they had,” 
Donovan said. 
“Certainly there 
were some frus -
trating games, 
but I give that 
team a lot of respect, because 
they really overachieved.” 
Players like Joel Reinhart and 
Dan Williams helped Donovan 
lay the foundation for what 
would become one of college bas -
ketball’s premier programs. “In their senior year, giving 
them a chance to go to the Sweet 
16 and experience some things 
that they never had before was 
special,” Donovan said.
As Donovan was taking his 
first steps into the world of 
Southeastern Conference coach -
ing, his current players were 
spending more time on the mon -
key bars than the basketball 
court.
Chandler Parsons was an 
8-year-old fourth grader at 
Highlands Elementary in Ms. 
Kelly’s class.
While Donovan focused on 
notching win No. 1, Parsons was 
more concerned with the press -
ing academic matters of the mo -
ment.“I was learning how to write 
cursive,” he said.
But surely, even back then, 
basketball and the Gators were 
high on his priority list.
“Not in fourth grade, I don’t 
think,” Parsons said. 
“I was all about the recess 
back then.”
Now, as Donovan heads to -
ward the future, he takes the time 
to look back on the road he has 
traveled down. 
“It is always special when you 
get a chance to be a part of some -
thing, (have an) impact from the 
ground floor and be a part of the 
building process,” Donovan said. 
“There is definitely an apprecia -
tion for when it all started and 
everything that went into it.”Donovan goes for 300th win as Gator against Auburn
their giant, flat-screen TV .
Basically, Meyer has added extra spice 
to the already-good recipe put together by 
Spurrier.
Meyer just nabbed his second national 
title while, yes, Spurrier only has one, and, 
yes, most current recruits don’t care about 
the success Spurrier had here. But the re -
cruits — as well as every college football fan — know about UF’s tradition, even if 
they don’t care where it came from.
Meyer can ask for something, and he 
will probably get it. 
Spurrier asked for something and had 
to work to get it.
UF fans were furious when Spurrier 
was replaced by Ron Zook. After all, a 
prestigious program like UF’s deserved 
better than Zook, didn’t it? That’s because 
Spurrier established tradition and raised 
expectations.Just a few years ago, even though most 
were pleased with Meyer’s hiring, very 
few thought anybody could ever touch 
King Steve’s crown. 
He was the father of UF football, and 
many were hoping he would be brought 
back instead Meyer being brought in.
If Spurrier still wanted to be the coach 
here, he could have been. The only rea -
son he’s not is because he was Coaching 
Victim No. 87  who thought he could make 
it in the NFL. If you make a list of the best current col -
lege coaches, only a fool would put Meyer 
anywhere lower than third, and it would 
be just as foolish to put Spurrier in the top 
10. But we’re not talking about the current 
situation. We’re talking about the impact 
made on this program.
 That’s where Spurrier can still top the 
list.
After Meyer goes out and wins three 
more national titles with the Gators, then 
let’s have this chat again.BRIAN , from page26Donovan

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — There was no ex-
travagant celebration Saturday night.
Sure, UF’s players sang with the band, 
Tim Tebow did his usual victory lap and 
the Gators were smiling as they ran off the 
field at Vanderbilt Stadium.
But an ignorant bystander would have 
had no idea UF just clinched a spot in the 
Southeastern Conference Championship with its 42-14 blowout of Vanderbilt on Saturday night. 
The biggest on-field celebration, in 
fact, came from Shelley Meyer, who Gator Chomped along with fans.
Meet the 2008 Gators, a team that says 
it’s just beginning to reach its goals.
UF will make its ninth appearance in the 
SEC Championship Game on Dec. 6 against No. 1 Alabama. The Gators are 6-2 in their previous games, but both losses (’92 and ’99) came against the Crimson Tide.
“There was a little celebration, but we expected to win, and we came out and 
got it done,” said linebacker Brandon 
Spikes, who led a UF (8-1, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) defense that held Vanderbilt (5-4) to 93 first-half yards.WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2009  ALLIGATOR, 23
Gators clinch SEC East

This is getting ridiculous.
UF made opposing players look like they 
had just gotten out of bed and barely combed their hair — again 
Percy Harvin made scoring touchdowns 
look easier than cooking Ramen — again.
The Gators read the opponent’s quarter -
back like a nursery rhyme and added to their interception total — again.  
Perhaps what’s even more ridiculous 
than anything is, as South Carolina (7-4) coach Steve Spurrier put it, the Gators (9-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) are a four-game winning streak away from their sec-
ond national championship in three years.
The run this UF football team is on is 
one that the 1996 Gators title-winning team 
would be willing to give a standing ovation. That ’96 team scored an absurd 376 points in conference play. This year’s team scored 359. And that’s with the majority of their second-string offense playing in the second half of many of those games.
In the stadium that Spurrier made fa-
mous, the biggest loss he had previously suffered — as a player or coach — was a 12-point defeat when he was manning the sidelines in 1993 against FSU.

10UF finished the year with nine blocked kicks, but a crazy three of those nine came in the first 20 minutes against Kentucky for Homecoming. William Green and 
Jeff Demps each blocked a punt, and those blocks set up UF touchdowns in the first quarter. On the Wildcats’ first drive of the second quarter, cornerback Joe Haden got a block of his own on a 3 1-yard field goal attempt. UF recovered and scored a touchdown three plays later, going up 35-0 as the second quarter was still young. The three blocks tied a school record, and UF’s 28 first-quarter points were the most the Gators had tallied under coach Urban Meyer.Block party against Kentucky
9For the third straight season (though one was called back because of a penalty), junior kick returner Brandon James showed his best stuff against the Volun-
teers. His 78-yard punt return touchdown with 4:42 remaining in the first quarter against Tennessee completely silenced the home crowd and put UF up 1 7-0. The game was essentially over at that point as the Volunteers looked dejected on the sidelines and could only muster 6 points all afternoon. James’ punt return was shown on ESPN’s package for best plays of the year and also in the Gators’ highlight reel at the championship celebration Sunday afternoon.Brandon James returns punt for a touchdown in Neyland
7At the time, no one knew how bad LSU would be this season. But when big, bad Brandon Spikes lumbered his way for a 52-yard interception return touch-
down on the first play of the fourth quarter against then No. 4 LSU, UF was officially back. Spikes then followed his touchdown with a celebratory punting of the football into the south end zone stands. He shanked the kick, but with the Gators winning 5 1-2 1, he didn’t much care. Spikes said it was his first interception returned for a touchdown at any level, and he finished the season with two after notching one against South Carolina.Spikes’ interception return and punting prowess8It was half a foot away from being an interception. Instead, Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin beneffitted from a lucky bounce, and Harvin made a spectacular 
catch to give UF a 7-0 lead early against LSU.  Tebow underthrew his pass but was bailed out by an LSU cornerback, and Harvin scooped up the tip to go untouched into the end zone. Coming into the game, LSU was the higher-ranked team, and that touchdown sparked a 1 7-point first quarter for the Gators on their way to a 5 1-2 1 victory.Harvin’s tip-catch against LSU
6Right after the loss to Mississippi, the Gators were feeling down. In UF’s next game against Arkansas, the team came out flat and only scored 14 points in the 
first half. But the Gators’ fourth quarter turned the season around. With 1 1:58 left in the game, Tebow found Harvin on a 2 1-yard slant, and the UF rout was on. Tebow immediately celebrated the moment by chest-bumping Urban Meyer, and the Gators went on to score another two touchdowns in the quarter to finish with a 38-7 win. That play kick-started the UF offense: The team scored at least 42 points in each of the next seven games.Tebow to Harvin late against Arkansas
5With the Gators up a tiny 4 points with about half of the fourth quarter still to play in the Southeastern Conference Championship Game against Alabama, the Crim-
son Tide was in dire need of a scoring drive to get back on top. Jermaine Cunningham and the UF defense said no. On third and 8 from their own 43, Cunningham broke through the offensive line and sacked Alabama quarterback John Parker Wilson for a loss of 1 1 yards. The Tide was forced to punt, and Alabama didn’t see the ball again until it was too late. UF scored on its next drive with a third-down touchdown pass from Tebow to Riley Cooper to put the Gators up for good 3 1-20.Cunningham sacks John Parker Wilson
4If Tebow and the Gators have one signature play, it’s the jump pass. First performed by Tebow to tight end Tate Casey in the 2006 LSU game, this year’s 
version was even more important. Ahead 1 7-14 with just over three minutes remaining in the BCS National Chapmionship Game and the ball on Oklahoma’s 4-yard line, Tebow faked a run to his left, leaped, and found wide receiver David Nelson in the end zone for the  game-clinching touchdown. The jump pass sealed UF’s second national title in three years and capped off an 1 1-play, 76-yard drive that lasted just under seven minutes.The jump pass lives on
3On Georgia’s second play from scrimmage, a second-and-13 from their own 15-yard line, the Bulldogs handed off to star running back Knowshon Moreno. 
But UF’s middle linebacker had plans of his own. Brandon Spikes drove Moreno to the ground, stopping him for a loss of 1 and then letting him know about it. Spikes trash talked a bit while still on top of Moreno, and that hit set the tempo all afternoon. Moreno finished the day with just 65 yards on the ground, and Spikes had seven tackles in UF’s 49-10 revenge-fueled win.Spikes gives Moreno some bad news
2UF had just taken the lead over Oklahoma with a Jonathan Phillips field goal kick, and Sam Bradford was not about to go quietly. With about 10 minutes 
remaining in the BCS National Championship Game, Bradford launched a deep ball to top receiver Juaquin Iglesias. Iglesias thought he had the catch, but Black thought otherwise. The sophomore safety literally took the ball from Iglesias’ hands before he hit the ground, and Iglesias looked stunned when he stood up and realized Black had intercepted the ball. The ensuing drive got the Gators the touchdown that sealed the title. “I think Iglesias needs to hit the weight room a bit more,” Black said Sunday. Ahmad Black steals one from Iglesias
1Oklahoma running back Chris Brown had already racked up 73 rushing yards in the game, so the Sooners figured 
he’d be a shoo-in to score with a first-and-goal situation. Instead, the Gators rejected him. On four straight plays, Brown got the handoff from Sam Bradford. On those four plays, he combined for 6 yards. Defensive tackle Torrey Davis made the hits on third and goal and fourth and goal, denying the Sooners 7 points that would have put them ahead 14-7. The game could have been all Oklahoma from that point. UF also stopped an Oklahoma drive at the end of the first half thanks to a comical, bobbling Major Wright interception with six seconds left in the half.Gators stand tall on the goal line

The rest of the nation should 
have a succinct message for 
Mississippi’s Kentrell Lockett: 
Thanks for screwing it up for the 
rest of us. 
If Lockett hadn’t blocked UF’s 
final extra-point attempt in the 
Gators’ sole loss Sept. 27, then 
the game might have gone into 
overtime. Maybe UF would’ve 
won and gotten too cocky the rest 
of the year.
Instead, there was Tim Tebow 
trudging to the postgame press 
conference, eyes red and school -
boy grin gone. He gazed at the 
ground most of the time.
Tebow knew he had to choose 
his words carefully. This couldn’t 
be your typical, emotion-laden 
statement. 
So he leaned slightly forward, 
bit his lip, looked straight ahead 
and rested his hands on the po -
dium.
He needed to brace himself for 
these declarations.
They weren’t for the faint of 
heart.
“I just want to say one thing. To 
the fans and everybody of Gator 
Nation. ... I’m sorry. Extremely 
sorry. We were hoping for an un -
defeated season. That was my 
goal, something Florida has nev -
er done here. But I promise you 
one thing: A lot of good will come 
out of this.” 
“You have never seen any 
player in the entire country play 
as hard as I will play the rest of 
the season. You will never see 
someone push his team as hard 
as I will push everybody the rest 
of the season. You will never see a 
team play harder than we will the rest of the season. God bless.”
Translation: Good luck, every -
body. 
They needed it, and even 25 
boxes of Lucky Charms, 10 four-
leaf clovers and a couple of rab -
bits’ feet couldn’t have helped 
opponents stop Tebow from ful -
filling his promise heard ‘round 
SportsCenter.
That night, junior receiver 
David Nelson and teammates sat 
at their homes feeling sorry for 
themselves. 
Their hopes of an undefeated 
season were gone. That’s when 
one of them visited a Web site 
showing Tebow’s soliloquy from 
that afternoon. Tears filled their 
eyes, but they were hopeful tears. 
That’s what Tebow’s speech had 
brought them: belief that their 
season was still worth playing 
for.
“Let’s go beat this thing,” 
Nelson said.
The mission has been accom -
plished. It’s hard to imagine a 
player pushing himself or his 
teammates harder than Tebow 
did, and the Gators showed their 
toughness on the field. 
There was no promise of a 
national championship, and not 
even a guarantee of another win 
for the rest of the season.
Some have called that speech 
the “Tear-bow,” but look who’s 
crying now. 
“I don’t know where this team 
would have been if he hadn’t said it,” Nelson said. 
“After the Ole Miss loss, ev -
eryone was just devastated. We 
were just searching for answers. 
We were just looking for some -
thing to hold on to. We had no -
where to go.”
His teammates have called 
him Superman. Others say it’s 
just “Tebow being Tebow.”
That speech, however, went 
above anything Tebow had done 
before.
“I’ve never had (a player) like 
this,” UF coach Urban Meyer 
said. “Tim’s got something spe -
cial inside him. I’m not talking about throwing. I’m not talking 
about running. I’m talking about 
making everyone around him 
better.
“At this point in time, in my 
opinion, he’s one of the greatest 
players to ever play the game.”
His speech is being talked 
about in historic terms. It’s be -
ing talked about in the same dis -
cussion as Knute Rockne’s “Win 
One for the Gipper.” Who knows 
whether it belongs in that cat -
egory? 
But Tebow’s words inspired 
almost 100 other young men to 
work harder at the game of foot -ball than they ever had at any -
thing in their lives.
“I really took to heart what he 
said,” Nelson said.
Nelson wasn’t the only one. 
There was a difference in the en -
tire team, from the defense to the 
punting unit.
“You see how it made a differ -
ence on the season with him get -
ting up and making that speech,” 
sophomore defensive end Carlos 
Dunlap said.
And to think there’s still one 
more year of this. 
Once again, good luck to ev -
erybody else.WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2009  ALLIGATOR , 25

UF FOOTBALL
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator.org
The stars must align. The domi -
noes must fall the right way.
Balls are tipped but caught any -
way.
New faces say hello. Old ones 
say farewell.
Some moments last a little lon -
ger thanks to timeouts.
In the end, it’s the actors of the 
moments — the players, the coach -
es, even fate — that led to the win -
ning of a crystal ball in Miami.
The 2008 UF football team won 
the BCS National Championship 
as the youngest team to do so, with 
a safety too small, a quarterback 
who couldn’t lead a comeback 
and an offensive coordinator who 
couldn’t use all his playmakers.
  
Ten years ago, Urban Meyer 
walked into the Swamp.
He came to the Sunshine State 
on a recruiting trip while he was 
the wide receivers coach for Notre 
Dame.
He left blistering cold tempera -
tures behind in South Bend, Ind., 
and welcomed Gainesville’s sun -
shine, palm trees and tan young 
ladies.
He stepped onto the field. 
He saw the dividends of Steve 
Spurrier in his prime, Southeastern 
Conference Championship years 
painted on the walls as if they were 
free handouts. He saw the spoils of 
a ’96 national title.
When he reached midfield, he 
pulled out his phone and dialed 
his wife, Shelley.
“Guess where I’m standing,” 
he said.
“Where are you?” she replied.
“I’m at The Swamp, at the 50-yard line.”
“What’s it like?” she asked.
“This is it. This is the place.”
  
A little over three years ago, a 
St. Augustine Nease High senior 
named Tim Tebow announced he 
was coming to Gainesville on live 
television.
Tales of his immense will, such 
as playing through a broken leg, 
had already begun to spread.
Turns out the legend was just 
beginning.
On Sept. 27, it got 75 words lon -
ger.
Years from now, it will likely 
only be known as “The Promise.” 
That’s what happens when history 
has a chance to reflect on itself.
At the time, it was just a 21-year-
old kid standing at a podium, un -
able to stop the tears from welling 
in his eyes.
He had to commit to playing 
better, if only because he couldn’t 
bear to feel like this again.
And he never did.
The Gators rattled off 10 straight 
wins, including eight by 28 points 
or more.
He battled through rain in 
Tallahassee. He led his first fourth-
quarter comeback to seal an SEC 
title. He overcame his worst first-
half performance to take home a 
BCS title and Offensive MVP hon -
ors.
Now, he just wants a shot to do 
it all again.
  
Five months ago, a 5-foot-9 
sophomore named Ahmad Black 
switched to safety.
It was a move made out of 
desperation after projected start -
ing safety Dorian Munroe tore his 
ACL.The converted cornerback had 
played in just seven games the 
year before, and most fans proba -
bly didn’t know his name. He con -
sidered transferring to a Division 
I-AA program. 
Everyone learned his name this 
year.
The player called too small 
and too slow by his own head 
coach ended up being too strong 
for Oklahoma receiver Juaquin 
Iglesias. Black sealed the BCS title 
game when he stole Sam Bradford’s 
pass from Iglesias’ hands and left 
the Heisman winner wondering 
what else he could do.
  
Now, the off-season brings hel -
los and goodbyes. National Signing 
Day awaits on Feb. 4. The seniors 
have played their last games. Dan 
Mullen and John Hevesy have left 
for Mississippi State. Phillip Fulmer 
has departed from Tennessee, and 
Steve Spurrier tasted a blowout in 
his old home. Georgia had an extra 
couple of minutes to relish in de -
feat.
Now Meyer, the king of even-
numbered years, must face pos -
sibly his toughest test in ’09: han -
dling a team projected to repeat 
with the talent to do so.
He went 13-0 at Utah in 2004 
and holds two crystal balls for his 
’06 and ’08 UF teams, but he still 
understands all the factors that 
must align.
“V ery rarely do you get to be 
a part of something like this,” he 
said. “I’ve been involved with col -
lege football for over 20 years. I’m 
a big fan of college football. I study 
college football. This is as good a 
group of young people as I’ve ever 
been around. This is certainly one 
of the greatest football teams in 
college football history.”Paths meet at crystal trophy

UF quarterback Tim Tebow smiles as fans chant “One more year!” during 
the national championship celebration in The Swamp on Sunday.
I still giggle at the thought of Steve 
Spurrier throwing down his visor in -
side The Swamp. 
That’s part of his legacy. And the really 
funny part is that he would only throw it 
down once, maybe twice a game. Gators 
fans were happy he got that upset only a 
few times per game.
There was a lot to be peeved about back 
in the mid ’80s.
That’s why Spurrier is still the most 
meaningful coach in UF history. Urban Meyer is a better 
coach, but his coach -
ing thumbprint has 
not left the impres -
sion Spurrier’s has. 
Go back a little 
more than four years. 
Meyer was touted 
as Gainesville’s new 
savior while the 
phrase “Urban Renewal” took flight.
Renewal. In other words, bringing back something that already existed. 
It was something Spurrier built.  
If there had been no Spurrier, there would 
be no 8-year-old Timmy Tebow cheering 
on Danny Wuerffel late at night in his or -
ange-and-blue pajamas. 
There would be no reason why Meyer 
would even consider leaving Utah for 
Gainesville. Ben Hill Griffin Stadium 
would not be called “The Swamp.” 
Do you credit Ben Franklin for invent -
ing electricity or General Electric for main -taining it and improving upon Franklin’s 
original findings?
Now, Meyer has gone way above just 
maintaining the program, but he did not 
turn on the switch to the crazed universe 
of UF football. 
That was Spurrier. He is the creator, 
and Meyer is the successor. Spurrier built 
the house while Meyer added the spiffy 
Jacuzzi on the porch and bought a Wii for In Meyer’s Swamp, Spurrier established traditions, expectations

The game was over in the first 
quarter, so it’s understandable to just 
get the basics in.
Louis Murphy’s 16-yard touch -
down reception just four minutes 
in set the tone for No. 2 UF, and 
the Gators (10-1, 7-1 Southeastern 
Conference) kept pouring it on The 
Citadel (4-8) in their 70-19 victory Saturday afternoon.
The result of this game was never 
in doubt — 17 minutes into the game, 
UF was on pace for 124 points. 
Starting quarterback Tim Tebow 
was out of the game with five min -
utes to go in the second quarter, as 
was wide receiver Percy Harvin.
Tebow added three passing touch -
downs to his stats, and Harvin had 
125 yards in the first quarter.
Instead of the score, Saturday’s 
story was Senior Day.It had been seven years since Javier 
Estopinan scored a touchdown.
Considering he plays on the other 
side of the ball, the Gators’ redshirt 
senior defensive tackle doesn’t get 
too many opportunities, but Saturday 
was different.
With the Gators already ahead 49-6 
early in the third quarter, he got his 
first touchdown since his sophomore 
year of high school on a 1-yard run.

TALLAHASSEE — It seemed ap -
propriate that the final step to Atlanta 
would resemble a swamp.
With rain hailing from the heav -
ens, the No. 2 Gators (10-1) avoided a 
slip-up and continued their dominat -
ing ways Saturday, blowing out the 
Seminoles (8-4) 45-15 in front of 83,237 poncho-donning fans.
UF’s offensive output set a team re -
cord for points at the 58-year-old Doak 
S. Campbell Stadium, but the biggest 
question stemmed from a second-quar -
ter fall.
How is Percy Harvin?
The junior playmaker drew a gasp 
from the UF faithful when he took a 
direct snap, ran left, went down and 
could not get back to his feet.
After a lengthy look from trainers on 
the field, he did his best to try and walk off, but the hobble could not be missed.
Coach Urban Meyer called it an an -
kle sprain after the game Saturday and 
did not reveal much more Sunday eve -
ning, classifying Harvin as question -
able for this week. The junior will not 
practice the next few days.
“He’s here today, and he’s moving 
around a little bit,” Meyer said Sunday 
evening.
With or without Harvin, UF can fi -
nally turn its attention to a game that 
has gathered hype for weeks.

Georgia may be The Peach State, but there were more 
than a few oranges circling the Georgia Dome field after the 
Gators (12-1, 8-1 Southeastern Conference) defeated Alabama 
(12-1) on Saturday evening.
Still, the sweetness of those oranges couldn’t com -
pare to the sweetness of the news UF got Sunday night.  
For the second time in three years, the Gators will be playing 
in the BCS National Championship Game. 
UF, No. 2 in the only BCS standings that matter, will head 300 miles south to take on No. 1 Oklahoma at Dolphin 
Stadium in Miami on Jan. 8, seven days after the Orange 
Bowl is played at the same venue. The two teams have never 
met.
The Gators finished just .018 points ahead of No. 3 Texas 
in the standings, the Longhorns being their only barrier to a 
matchup with the Sooners.
To say waiting for the announcement was nerve-racking 
for coach Urban Meyer would be a gross understatement.

MIAMI — Titletown is alive and 
well again.
It just took a little longer to realize 
this time.
This one was a far cry from the 
blowout two years again in Glendale, 
but the fireworks and confetti were just 
as sweet for the Gators. Brandon Spikes knows that Gainesville now contains 
the best football program in America.
“If ya’ll want us,” Spikes said, “You 
gotta come get us.”
Urban Meyer became the first coach 
to win two BCS national champion -
ships.
“It feels great,” Meyer said. It is 
humbling when you consider all the 
great coaches and players who have an 
opportunity to do it. It only shows the 
professional way that our coaches and players prepare every week.”
While the majority of the defense 
is made up of the same players from 
a year ago, linebacker Ryan Stamper 
said the defense has come miles from 
the young squad that gave 41 points 
to Michigan in last year’s Capital One 
Bowl.
UF (13-1) held Oklahoma (12-2) to 
a season-low in points and the Gators
