A year ago, Will Muschamp was on top of 
the world.
Florida had just outplayed No. 13 Florida 
State on its own ﬁ  eld — a stark turnaround 
from UF’s loss the year before.
The Gators were angling for a national-title 
bid. Florida still had a shot to play in the BCS National Championship game, if Southern Cali-fornia could beat Notre Dame.
It was not to be, but still, Muschamp was 
happy.
He joked with the media, saying the Gators’ 
win against the Seminoles was “sexy,” and he had considered meeting reporters shirtless. His wife and players convinced him otherwise. 
What a difference a year makes. In 2011, FSU dominated UF at Ben Hill Grif-
ﬁ  n Stadium, winning by two touchdowns de-spite being held to fewer than 100 yards of total offense.
But now it was Florida’s turn. The Gators’ 
win had all the hallmarks of a Will Muschamp dream team.
A bruising running game led Florida’s of-
fense to 37 points. Senior Mike Gillislee and freshman Matt Jones combined for 221 yards and three touchdowns.
The defense was stout. Freshman Antonio 
Morrison turned the tide of the game with an earth-shattering hit on quarterback E.J. Manuel.
And, of course, there was a comeback. The 
Seminoles climbed back from a 13-point deﬁ  cit only to see the Gators re-emerge and score 24 unanswered points to seal the win.
That was a year ago. What a difference a year makes.

The 2013 season has been anything but 
happy for Florida. The calendar year has been a disaster. After Muschamp’s high point at Doak Campbell Stadium, things only got worse.
A month later, fewer than 48 hours after 
the ball dropped in Times Square, the Gators dropped the ball in New Orleans. 
Facing an underdog Louisville squad fa-
vored by nobody, Florida caved.
Denied a shot at a national title, the Gators 
had little but bragging rights to ﬁ  ght for, and they didn’t even get those. The Cardinals showed up to play, unlike the boys from Gainesville.
“We wasn’t supposed to be here in a lot of 
people’s eyes,” Sharrif Floyd said after the loss, “and we proved the whole country wrong.”
Florida proved the whole country wrong 
with the loss as well.
There was a mass exodus from the program 
after the ﬂ  op in the French Quarter.
Backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who 
competed for the starting quarterback up until the Gators’ 2012 season opener, announced he was transferring. 
The Gators also lost several players to the 
NFL Draft. Some, like Jon Bostic, Josh Evans and Gillislee, graduated. But others, such as Floyd, Jelani Jenkins and Jordan Reed, ceded their ﬁ  nal seasons to enter the draft.
Having players leave for the draft is normal 
attrition every program deals with.
But it proved especially costly for Florida.Each player who left college early would 
have played a crucial role on this year’s team.
But despite surely knowing his program 
would lose many key players soon, Muschamp was hopeful that night at the Superdome.“We’ve had a great year, and we’re moving 
this thing forward at a rapid pace,” he said after the loss. “And I’m excited where we are. Very disappointed with the outcome today, but very positive as we move forward.”

It was not great to be a Florida Gator in the 
summer of 2013. Between former Gator Aaron Hernandez being arrested on murder charges and current Gator Antonio Morrison being ar-rested on battery and barking charges, the sea-son could not start fast enough.
The team entered fall camp relatively 
healthy. Offensive lineman Jon Halapio had a partially torn pectoral muscle, quarterback Jeff Driskel was recovering from an appendectomy, and tailback Matt Jones was out with a viral in-fection.
Two ﬂ  uke sicknesses and one weight lifting 
injury — otherwise, the team was ready.
But the so-called injury bug struck quickly.Its ﬁ  rst victim: wide receiver Andre Debose. 
The redshirt senior suffered a torn ACL during fall camp. But Florida had a large group of fresh-man wideouts. Surely one of them would make up for Debose’s minimal production in 2012.
Offensive tackle Chaz Green was next. He 
suffered a torn labrum on Aug. 20.
No big deal. The Gators had depth at offen-
sive line.
The injuries only got worse from there.Florida opened the season with a win against 
Toledo, but after a turnover-driven loss to Mi-ami on Sept. 7, it looked to recover against Ten-nessee.
One awkward tackle later, the Gators’ start-
ing quarterback was out for the season — Driskel suffered a fractured ﬁ  bula in the ﬁ  rst quarter.
Redshirt junior Tyler Murphy ﬁ  lled in admi-rably, but the hits kept coming.
Three days after the Gators defeated the Vol-
unteers, they suffered arguably their biggest loss of the season.
Defensive tackle Dominique Easley attempt-
ed to defend a screen pass in practice and suf-fered a torn ACL.
It was the senior’s second ACL tear in three 
years, and the injury ultimately ended his col-lege career. He announced he would not seek a medical redshirt and instead prepared for May’s NFL Draft.
Easley was by no means the last Florida 
player to go down for the season. The injury re-port kept growing.
In the two months since Easley suffered 
his injury, starters Jones (torn meniscus), Tyler Moore (fractured elbow), Antonio Morrison (torn meniscus) and Michael Taylor (sprained MCL) have suffered season-ending injuries.
Others, such as Murphy (shoulder sprain), 
D.J. Humphries (sprained MCL) and Jonathan Bullard (undisclosed) have missed multiple games but have not been ruled out for the rest of the season.
Non-starters who received signiﬁ  cant play-
ing time, such as Alex Anzalone (dislocated shoulder), Jeremi Powell (torn ACL) and Nick Washington (shoulder) have seen injuries short-en their seasons as well.
“I’m pretty sure if we had all our guys this 
season, [this season] would be different,” senior Jaylen Watkins said. 

Will Muschamp does not make excuses. 
Throughout the season, his oft-repeated mantra has been, “Man down, man up.”
But there are only so many times a team can 
man up.
“I don’t know that it’s depth issues,” he said. 
“I think it’s different moving parts. The starting lineup week-to-week has been different for us in a lot of situations across the board.”
But losing — for any reason — does not sit 
well in “Gator Nation.”
Muschamp and his coaching staff have be-
come easy targets. Fans want heads to roll, and players and coaches alike are hearing the com-plaints.
“I try to stay away from it, but it’s every-
where,” wide receiver Solomon Patton said. “It makes me mad.”
While some fans want Muschamp gone, he 
does not appear to be going anywhere.
Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley is-
sued a statement through the team website on Nov. 13 saying he supported Muschamp “a thousand percent.”
And Muschamp doesn’t have just Foley be-
hind him.
Gordon “Stumpy” Harris, one of ﬁ  ve Flori-
da legacy directors (a booster who has donated more than $3 million), says he backs Muschamp as well.
“I’ve known every head football coach at 
the University of Florida on a ﬁ  rst-name basis since Bob Woodruff,” Harris said. “And I liked Muschamp a lot … He’s a little ﬁ  ery, and I like that.”
Harris, who has been a season-ticket holder 
since 1956, has seen plenty of mediocre Gators teams over the year — including the winless 1979 squad. And he has words for those calling for Muschamp to be ﬁ  red.
“If I were in his shoes, I’d try to ﬁ  gure out 
some way to make it clear that I’m going to make the decisions,” Harris said. “I’m not go-ing to be inﬂ  uenced by fans. I’m not going to be told by fans.”Harris said a lot of the boosters he has talked 
to agree.
“It’s sort of like the closing of the ranks,” 
he said. “Those are the kind of people I associ-ate with … I don’t put up with mean-spirited people.”
Two days after Florida suffered a home loss 
to Georgia Southern — the ﬁ  rst time the Gators lost to a current FCS team since 1946 — Mus-champ met with the media. Foley sat in the back of the meeting room.
Two days earlier, Muschamp walked into 
the same room, defeated. He said the game was “an embarrassment.”
But this time, Muschamp walked into the 
room with conﬁ  dence. Was he worried for his job? “Absolutely not.” Would he be back in 2014? “Absolutely.” 
Despite the injuries, upset losses and never-
ending criticism, the third-going-on-fourth-year coach said Florida was close to regaining the level of play from 2012.
“Regardless of the results Saturday after-
noon, which is all disappointing for everyone … I just don’t feel like we’re that far off,” Mus-champ said. “I think we’ve got a really good football team.”
What a difference a year can make.

Students leaving town should 
be extra vigilant while driving dur-
ing Thanksgiving Break. Florida Highway Patrol troopers will be, too.
The patrol is increasing the 
number of personnel who normal-ly monitor Florida’s roads starting Thanksgiving day and continuing until Sunday, according to an FHP news release.
FHP is participating in a nation-
wide campaign called Operation Combined Accident Reduction Effort, aka CARE. Troopers will pay special attention to aggressive driving and seatbelt use, according to the release.
During last Thanksgiving Break, troopers issued more than 9,300 tickets. About 4,000 were for speed-ing, 650 for seatbelt violations, and 145 for driving under the inﬂ  uence, according to the release.They also gave roadside assis-
tance for about 2,300 drivers, which drivers can use by dialing *347.
Allison Curran, a UF commu-
nications, sciences and disorders senior, said she’s going to drive extra cautiously on the way home to Tampa and on the drive back to Gainesville.
The 21-year-old said she usually 
sets her cruise control at 73 miles per hour but sometimes drives up to 80 miles per hour. However, she said she’ll stick below 80 for her Thanksgiving commute.
“If I know there’s going to be 
increased patrols, I wouldn’t risk it for the extra ﬁ  ve to 10 minutes,” she said, adding that she thinks the more troopers, the better. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with enforcing the law.”

� THANKSGIVING FALLS 
ON THE SECOND NIGHT OF HANUKKAH. 
REBECCA TURKEL
Alligator Contributing Writer
American Jews are prepar-
ing for even more celebration 
this Thanksgiving, as it also falls on the second night of Ha-nukkah.
For UF students, this means 
combining traditions and be-ing able to spend Hanukkah at home — which is usually cel-ebrated during ﬁ  nals week.
Rabbi Gail Swedroe of UF 
Hillel attributes the early start of Hanukkah to the Jewish cal-endar. Judaism follows a lunar calendar, which means holi-days have a certain range of dates, she said.
The last time the two holi-days shared the same day was in 1888, according to the Asso-ciated Press.
It is not estimated to happen 
again for the next 79,043 years.
But Swedroe said the dif-
ferent dates should not affect Hanukkah traditions.
“I think the only difference 
is people will be eating turkey on Hanukkah and maybe hav-ing some latkes on Thanksgiv-ing,” she said.
UF Hillel hosted a Thanks-
giving-themed Shabbat dinner on Friday and will host a Ha-nukkah party on the holiday’s last night, Dec. 5, Swedroe said.
“It’s interesting because Ha-
nukkah often happens during ﬁ  nals, so students aren’t able to go home for the holiday,” she said. “So if anything, there ‘Thanksgivukkah’ 
presents rare holiday for Jewish families

City ofﬁ  cials say Gainesville has not 
pursued bringing an ice rink back to the 
plaza after a scrubbed attempt last year.Finances are one roadblock, said City 
of Gainesville spokesman Bob Woods. In years past, the city had to subsidize the rink.
“The cost of the rink to the city ranged 
from $120,000 to $150,000 per year,” Woods said. “Due to the cost, we decided not to have the ice rink.”Interim Manager of Cultural Affairs  
Russell Etling, said no other vendor has reached out to the city this year to promote an ice rink, and the city can’t afford the ﬁ  -nancial risk.

would be with an independent contrac-Gainesville not pursuing downtown ice skating rink this yearSEE HOLIDAY, PAGE 4

“The Greatest Show on Earth” will make its way to 
Gainesville for the ﬁ  rst time in January.
The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will pres-
ent a “Super Circus Heroes” theme Jan. 10-12 in the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center.
Renee Musson, associate director of the O’Connell Cen-
ter, wrote in an email that the “Super Circus Heroes” theme is “based on the circus’ current focus to stop childhood bully-ing.”
She said the circus will be in town prior to the event at vari-
ous charities trying to spread the message and “help folks ﬁ  nd their inner super hero to stop the bullying.”
“They are excited to be here so that every ‘child of any age’ 
can get to experience ‘The Greatest Show on Earth,’” Musson said.
The show dates and times are Jan. 10 at 7 p.m.; Jan. 11 at 11 
a.m., 3 p.m., 7 p.m. and Jan. 12 at 1 p.m.
The tickets will range in price from $14 to $58 and will go on 
sale Friday at 10 a.m.  
There will also be will be coupons available as the show gets 
closer, Musson said.
Emily Astrom, a 19-year-old UF mathematics sophomore, 
said she would go to the circus when she was younger and that she’s excited it is coming to Gainesville. 
“I would rearrange my schedule just to go,” she said.Laura Hernandez, an 18-year-old UF accounting freshman, 
said she thinks it’s awesome a circus is coming to campus.
Hernandez said the fact that it’s coming to the O’Connell Center is convenient because many freshmen might not have transportation otherwise.
According to the Ringling Bros. website, Ringling Bros. and 
Barnum & Bailey will showcase “superhuman athleticism, power and pageantry that will have Children Of All Ages dis-covering their own superhuman strength.”
“This show will be great for everyone,” Musson said. Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus to perform at UF in January

The Reitz Union Rion Ballroom was ﬁ  lled 
with about 70 students Monday night who 
were blinded by bandanas, with socks on their hands or gesticulating wildly, all while eating roasted chicken and mashed potatoes.
The event, called Dining with Disabilities, 
was put on by Student Government’s disabil-ity affairs cabinet. Chairwoman Jillian Roberts  said the mission of the event was to attempt to create a more inclusive community at UF.
“The purpose is to educate students in the 
UF community about disabilities, and to open their eyes to different ways of life,” she said. “Just because someone can’t see as well as you, hear as well as you, speak as well as you or move as well as you doesn’t make them any less valuable or important of a person.”
The event featured the simulation of four 
disabilities, said Roberts, a 20-year-old UF communications sciences and disorders ju-nior.
Hearing loss was simulated with ear-
plugs, vision loss with blindfolds and speech impairment with a drawing of a heart on the participants’ hand to remind them to stay si-lent.
Hemiplegia, where half of the body is paralyzed, was represented by covering the dominant hand with a tube sock, rendering it unusable for the night.
The event, funded by SG, featured four 
speakers. Each speaker talked about their per-sonal journey and individual difﬁ  culties with his or her disability. Disabilities the speakers face included narcolepsy, autism, deafness and legal blindness.
One of the speakers, Haley Moss, is a 
high-functioning UF psychology sophomore with autism. 
The 19-year-old called the event “abso-
lutely great.” She said that what students experienced at this dinner is what every dis-abled person has to learn.
“You have to adapt," Moss said. "Every-
one who doesn’t have arms eating dinner, everyone who is blind and had to be fed their food.  That’s an adaption and you need extra help. You can still eat, you just have to do it a little differently.”
Dining with Disabilities aimed at increasing inclusivity 
“The purpose is to educate 
students in the UF community 
about disabilities, and to open their 
eyes to different ways of life.”

UF economics student Ryan Harris, 20, takes a break while running 
stadiums Monday afternoon. The temperature reached a low of 61.
Rink contractor had problems last year
tor,” Etling said.
Prior to 2007, the downtown plaza used to fea-
ture an ice skating rink every winter, but the city’s 
parks and recreation department could no longer afford the cost of the winter wonderland transfor-mation.
Last winter, students and residents alike were 
excited an outside contractor was going to bring the ice rink back.
Midwest Displays, a Pensacola-based com-
mercial Christmas display company, attempted to bring the rink last year.
The obstacles that eventually froze the project 
included several unsuccessful repairs to the chiller lines that freeze the ice and difﬁ  culties ﬁ  tting the ice rink on the plaza. According to Alligator archives, the city also 
struggled with the 35-foot tent designed to cover the ice.
Daniel Landesberg, a 21-year-old UF telecom-
munication senior, said an ice skating rink would be a positive addition to the city and a great place to go on dates or to hang out with friends.
“Hopefully, we will be able to bring back the 
rink in the future,” Landesberg said.
The city still plans to have other events to en-
courage the holiday spirit.  
On Dec. 7 at 6 p.m., the annual tree lighting cer-
emony will take place at the Thomas Center.
The city will also decorate the downtown area, 
including Bo Diddley Community Plaza and City Hall, with light displays. 
Woods said installations are set to begin the 
week after Thanksgiving.ICE , from page 1
Some families will combine traditions
will be more people home for the 
holiday.”
Pearleen Lederman, a 22-year-
old UF ﬁ  nance senior, is going home for Thanksgiving despite the proximity to ﬁ  nals.
“This year my family is going 
to celebrate Thanksgiving and just add some of the Hanukkah tradi-tions,” she said.
Lederman said her family will 
light the candles and eat some tra-ditional food associated with the holiday.
“These are my two favorite hol-
idays,” she said, “So I’m so excited that they’re on the same night this year.”
Danielle Lehrer, a 20-year-old 
UF political science and Russian studies junior, said her family plans to combine decorations from both holidays.
“We will light the menorah 
all together the second night of Hanukkah during our meal,” she said. “It will be really special to have the whole family together for both holidays.”
Lehrer said the late Thanksgiv-
ing Break will make it hard to bal-ance exams, but she is looking for-ward to the family and food aspect of going home.
She is also planning on combin-
ing the traditional foods by making latkes with a dollop of cranberry sauce on top.
Max Wolfson, a 19-year-old UF 
marketing sophomore, said his family will celebrate the holidays as two separate days.
“I don’t think my family will 
combine anything,” he said, “ex-cept maybe the candle lighting for dinner.”

Two shoplifters were arrested Monday afternoon af-
ter they attacked an employee and led police ofﬁ  cers on a 
chase through Butler Plaza.
Gainesville Police arrested 19-year-old Brandon Lee 
Williams, of Gainesville, and a 17-year-old boy from Ar-cher who was not identiﬁ  ed because of his age, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias. They face charges of rob-bery and theft.At about 2 p.m., ofﬁ  cers arrived at 
Kohl’s, located at 3535 SW Archer Road, after the pair allegedly stole more than 
$700 worth of clothing from the store, ac-cording to an arrest report.
As they were running away, the teen-
agers hit a Kohl’s loss-prevention em-ployee multiple times, inﬂ  icting a large cut on his head, according to the report.
The shoplifters continued running across Southwest Archer Road and into Butler Plaza, Tobias said. Ofﬁ  cers used police dogs to track their scents into woods near Windmeadows Apartments.
A resident then pointed out the teens to a Gainesville 
Police/Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce Joint Aviation Unit helicopter, Tobias said. Williams and the minor came out of the woods and were arrested at about 2:20 p.m.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Williams into the Alachua County Jail 
at about 5 p.m., where he remained as of press time with no bond.  Shoplifters injure Kohl’s employee, race across Archer Road

Look, it’s 2013: We have tiny computers in our pockets, 
we can order pizzas without picking up a phone and we can stream an entire season of “Xena: Warrior Prin-
cess” on Netﬂ  ix in one sitting. Information is available at our ﬁ  ngertips, and communication is effortless with the help of smartphones.
So why in the world is Black Friday still a thing? It’s so 
primitive. People suit up and wait in the freezing cold — or the sweltering humidity, if you hail from South Florida — to await a feeding frenzy, except instead of a zebra carcass it’s a Nintendo 3DS. Something about Black Friday just brings out the worst in people, and it further fuels Americans’ bad reputation abroad as capitalism-happy, greedy lunatics stam-peding for the latest “it” gadget as if Walmart was an Eagles concert.
What possesses people to sacriﬁ  ce a warm post-Thanks-
giving meal nap or quality time with the couch and a good book for crowds of people hustling for the last Garmin GPS? It’s the same kind of people who join polar bear clubs: people who seem to thrive on discomfort to prove a point. Not to mention the poor, underpaid workers who are forced to deal with the madding crowds at the expense of time with their families.
The debate against Black Friday isn’t new, but a new trend 
among big retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy includes opening their doors on the evening of Thanksgiving Day to begin sales. Before people will have fully digested their calo-rie-ﬁ  lled Thanksgiving dinners, crazed shoppers will be thun-dering down the aisles of Target and Sears grabbing every discounted object in sight.
What’s especially disconcerting is that many college stu-
dents will undoubtedly be part of the hopping madness on Thanksgiving evening and Black Friday. Even though the hours we spend at home with our families are few and far between, many will sacriﬁ  ce that precious time in favor of Walmart.
Remember Emily’s pivotal monologue from “Our Town,” 
that you read Cliff’s Notes for when you were in 10th grade? In one heartbreaking scene, she revisits a moment from her childhood as a ghost and notices how little she and her family interact.
“Let’s really look at one another,” she says to the family 
members who can’t hear her. “We don’t have time to look at one another.”
We at the Alligator hope you’ll use this short break to 
take advantage of the short time you have with your parents, siblings, grandparents and close friends. As young 20-some-things, it seems that everything in life is transient — part-time jobs, classes, internships and intimate relationships. Although the holidays are a successful vehicle for big corporations to sell their products, use the time you have at home or in Gainesville to appreciate the important people in your life.

Thanksgiving Break starts early enough? Today’s question: Are you going shopping on Black 
Friday?History repeats itself: Senate goes nuclear
In a week that was dominated by the antics of the crack-
smoking mayor of Toronto and the remembrance of JFK, the United States Senate did something unprec-
edented.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pulled the 
trigger on the nuclear option, which allows presidential nominations — with the exception of Supreme Court ap-pointees — to be conﬁ  rmed by the Senate with a simple majority vote. Nominations for federal judges and bureau-crats will no longer have to pass the 60-vote threshold. This nuclear option would stop many ﬁ  libuster attempts during the conﬁ  rmation process. 
Filibusters are a known problem in the Senate. An 
extremely large amount of ﬁ  libusters have taken place during the Obama administration. Maybe Reid felt com-pelled to champion the nuclear option he always wanted in place.
If only that were reality. In 2005, when the Democrats 
were the minority party in the Senate, Reid said the pro-posed nuclear option the Republican majority wanted to put in place was a “raw abuse of power and will destroy the very checks and balances our founding fathers put in place to prevent absolute power by any one branch of gov-ernment.” Republicans threatened but did not implement the nuclear option in 2005 because Democrats were ﬁ  li-bustering then-President Bush’s appointments. It’s amaz-ing how history repeats itself.
Then-Senators Obama and Biden riled against this nu-
clear option and said that “if the majority chooses to end the ﬁ  libuster … (it will) put an end to democratic debate“ and “you cannot change the Senate rules by a pure major-ity vote,” respectively.
Consistency is not a strong suit of Washington politi-
cians.
We can parse through this partisan noise and agree that 
the Senate majority party always wants a simple major-ity vote in order to get their agenda through Congress. Filibusters were a problem in the Senate for both the Bush and Obama administrations.
Ramming this rule change is reminiscent of another Harry Reid stunt. Back in 2009, Reid ran the Affordable Care Act through the Senate much like he is doing with the nuclear option, and we all know how that is far-ing. 
Reid justiﬁ  ed the rule change 
by claiming that Congress is not working. This is, in fact, true.  Countless pieces of House legis-
lation have been denied debate in the Senate and pocket vetoed by the current Majority Leader Reid. But why let facts get in the way of your politics?  
The timing of this change is a little unusual. On one 
hand, the new Senate procedure successfully silenced the talk of the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act and the internal uneasiness of many in the administration of its second go. This move would also quickly get the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir-cuit  — considered to be the second most powerful court in the country — nominees conﬁ  rmed and ready to rest on the bench.
On the other hand, this move is close to the 2014 mid-
term elections. Many pundits and commentators predict that red-state Democrats will face uphill ﬁ  ghts this elec-tion season. Why would Reid implement this change if his majority is at risk? If he becomes the minority leader, at least he can fall back on his previous anti-nuclear option position.
Politicians on both sides try to bend the rules to get 
what they want. Historically, when politicians respected each other, no nuclear option was needed. Instead of gridlock and inaction, politicians collaborated and accom-plished great things.
Instead, we have politicians who try to game the sys-
tem to push their own agendas. The nuclear option might come and go, but it is a symptom of a larger problem in Washington.

Last year, I ﬁ  nally gave in and 
scheduled the eye exam I’d put off since high school. My 
lens prescription needed updat-ing, and I was tired of the bright red frames my 15-year-old self thought were cool. I was ready for some new glasses. Afterward, I en-gaged in the usual dance of pulling frames on and off my face a ridicu-lous number of times to choose a complementary pair.
When my glasses were ready 
and ﬁ  tted with the new lenses, I put them on and suddenly everything looked six inches farther away than before. The experience sparked an existential crisis.
We try on our friends’ glasses 
and watch reality shift back and forth, but these glasses were mine to keep. When I put them on, I wondered where all of the objects in my ﬁ  eld of vision truly existed.
Opinions aren’t so different. 
Writing this column taught me a thing or two about how to pres-ent an opinion to an audience who may or may not agree, in varying levels of intensity. Each of us wears our perspective like glasses — not a novel analogy — and they color the way we see.
The beauty of glasses and opin-
ions is we can try them on easily and, if they blur things beyond rec-ognition, remove them and accuse the original wearer of blindness. However, we must never defend our views so ferociously that we would be ashamed to admit a change in perspective later. I’ve done that this semester, and people have a way of making sure you re-member when it happens.
As the enigmatic author Dodin-
sky writes, “Do not make it a habit to dissect someone’s opinion to the point where you see the presence of malice where none exists.” 
Even when it’s straining, I urge 
you to try on the glasses of the person opposite you on the issue. Assume their beliefs and experi-ences and perhaps some clarity will come.
My biggest hope is that at least 
once this semester you tried my glasses and on — if only tempo-rarily — considered the shift in perspective as more than a ﬂ  eeting trial.

A new fast-food seafood restaurant has 
been reeling in business partially thanks to 
social media and a tie to UF.
The Original Wharf Express, 3333 SW 
34th St., in University Town Center by Peach Valley, offers a mix of seafood and usually serves its meals within 10 minutes.
Leslie Guy, the owner of the franchise, is a 
UF alumna who was active in Greek life dur-ing college, performed as a UF cheerleader and competed on the gymnastics team.
“Gainesville has become a part of me,” 
she said, “And I wanted to bring something back to Gainesville.” 
Part of her goal is to break the negative 
views many people have about fast-food seafood, she said.
The restaurant has primarily reached the student community through word of mouth, but kitchen manager RJ Wright said social media seems to help.
“As I keep updating my status and share 
the restaurant’s page on Facebook, I see more people coming in to try the food,” he said.
The restaurant also plans on expanding 
to other locations in the Gainesville area, Guy said.
Emily Dhondt, a 21-year-old UF adver-
tising senior who works in the restaurant, said students visit because they know other restaurants in the shopping center are good, and they’re looking for something new to try.
“I’ve seen a customer who has come in 
almost every single day this week because the food ... has a Southern charm to it,” she said.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 2013

Forget Black Friday — it’s Black Furday if you ask Pup-
py Hill Farm Animal Rescue.
The agency is offering reduced adoption prices for 25 
cats on Black Friday at PetSmart in Butler Plaza, said Kris-
ten Seymour, board member at Puppy Hill Farm Animal Rescue.
Cats usually cost $75, but on Friday, they will cost $25 
from noon until 5 p.m.
Adopters can choose an all-black or black-and-white 
cats from 11 weeks to 3 years old.“All of our cats have been vet checked, but depending on 
its age, it may need further vaccinations,” Seymour said.
A veterinarian will also be on site to help potential own-
ers.
“The doctor will just ask general questions to make sure 
the animal is the best ﬁ  t (for) the person. We want to make sure our kittens will have the right home for the holidays,” she said.
Shay Hill, a 20-year-old UF family, youth and commu-
nity science junior said she thinks the event is a cool idea.
“The deal is great; it’s just that my apartment won’t let 
me have animals,” Hill said.Seymour said potential adopters must bring in a state-
ment from their landlord saying he or she will allow ani-mals.
The decision to take home a new pet should depend on 
the adopter’s lifestyle, said Laurie Trenholm, executive di-rector and founder of Puppy Hill Farm.
“If you are a family who has time off during the holi-
days and have time to help the pet acclimate, then it can be great,” Trenholm said.Black Friday to include discounted cat adoptions in Butler Plaza

The annual College Destination Index 
by the American Institute for Economic 
Research ranked Gainesville the ﬁ  fth small metro area in the country for 2013-2014.
Seventy-ﬁ  ve cities were organized into 
four categories: small metros, mid-sized metros, major metros and college towns.
The ranking, which is based on 12 crite-
ria, focuses on the academic aspects of the area and the “quality of life,” said Steven Cunningham, chief economist for the com-pany. It also accounts for student diversity, entrepreneurial activity, and arts and lei-sure.
“It’s a terrible thing to go to a town where 
you don’t want to step off the campus,” Cunningham said. “The idea is that students should and do pick a college based on aca-demics and, certainly that puts Gainesville as a good place to go.”
Gainesville has been on the index since 
the ranking’s inception more than ﬁ  ve years ago. Last year, it was ranked fourth in its category, but this year the student diversity has increased signiﬁ  cantly, Cunningham, said.
Rubab Islam, an 18-year-old UF microbi-
ology freshman and Gainesville native, said the city is well-deserving of its rank.
“There’s Gator football, but then we also 
have a pretty active theater life and all sorts of multicultural events,” she said. “There’s something here for everyone.”TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Gators March for Babies met a record-
high fundraising goal of $100,000 Sunday 
at the 10th annual Gators March for Babies 5K on campus.
“This was the highest we’ve ever raised 
by a lot,” said Kyle Croft, community direc-tor for Alachua County March of Dimes.
The previous record high for fundrais-
ing was about $80,000.
Croft said about 600 people participated 
in the walk.
Earlier this month, the March of Dimes 
released its annual Premature Birth Report Card and gave Florida a “D” grade. Croft said the low grade made this year’s fund-raising even more important than in previ-ous years.
“It just really high-
lights the importance of 
what we’re doing and why we need to keep working for the babies,” Croft said.
Stephan Perets, di-
rector of Interfraternity Council recruitment for 
Gators March for Babies, said he was proud of how the event turned out.
“I feel like we couldn’t have done a bet-
ter job,” said the 21-year-old building con-struction management junior. “Everything went well and we’ve reached our goal, which is already $20,000 more than our best year. Being able to raise money for a cause like that just makes me feel really good.”Gators March for Babies

Savannah Jordan and the 
Florida soccer team were eliminated from the NCAA Tournament. Read the story on page 16.LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
JACKSONVILLE — With point guard 
Scottie Wilbekin inserted into the starting 
lineup for the first time since serving a five-game suspension for violating team rules, UF’s offense clicked from start to finish Monday night.
Behind Casey Prather’s 27 points, No. 15 
Florida (5-1) turned an organized and ef-ficient offensive performance into an 86-60 victory against Jacksonville in the Jackson-ville Veterans Memorial Arena.
Wilbekin was a big part of why Florida 
succeeded offensively. 
In his season debut, the senior account-
ed for 12 points on 5-of-9 shooting, five rebounds, three steals and seven assists against only two turnovers in 34 minutes of action. 
“I was a little nervous before the game, 
just because it’s been so long,” Wilbekin said. “But once the ball got tipped up and started moving up and down, I was back into it.”
The Gators shot 59.6 percent from the 
field and hit 8 of 13 shots from behind the arc. Michael Frazier II (17 points) sunk 5 of his 6 three-point attempts. Dorian Finney-Smith recorded 14 points and 11 rebounds, while Patric Young added 13 points. 
A big issue for the Gators last week was 
not having a true point guard in the rota-tion, as freshman Kasey Hill (high ankle sprain) was unavailable. 
But with Wilbekin finally in the fold In honor of this miserable season 
coming to a close, we at the alli-gatorSports Brand Picks Column 
would like to honor Florida’s bowl-less offseason. Well, no, that’s not entirely true. There will be plenty of bowls of chips to go around when the Gators are watching any one of 35 bowl games that they couldn’t get invited to. Make sure to remember the French onion dip! 
 If any Gator needs practice slum-
ming it on the couch, look no further than Thanksgiving dinner. Stay light on the stuffing and save room for seconds!
So grab a turkey leg and begin ex-
ercising your thumb on that remote, Gators! Watch some football, and get prepared for what’s going to be a long offseason.
This week, Joe Morgan and Phil-
lip Heilman debate the Iron Bowl — a game that will likely keep fans from changing the channel.
Auburn (+11) will triumph and 
Alabama will be sitting on the couch at home next weekend during the SEC Championship Game crying, “PAAWWWL” so hard because...
The Tigers have the best rushing 
offense in the SEC. Nick Saban is no match for — I’m really dumb for picking against Alabama, aren’t I?
- Joe Morgan
Alabama (-11) will mash Auburn 
up like potatoes en route to another SEC Championship Game appear-ance because...
Mmmm mashed potatoes are so 
good. Whip ‘em up with some butter and maybe a little bit of salt and pep-per, and you, my friend, have found heaven. Wait, we’re not talking about actual potatoes? Well, then.

Return of point guard sparks Florida victory

JACKSONVILLE — Billy 
Donovan stepped into the me-
dia room with Scottie Wilbekin not far behind. 
The other Gators available 
to speak — Michael Frazier II, Casey Prather and Patric Young  — had already finished their in-terviews in the hallway. They made their way to the bus.
Not Wilbekin, though.The senior point guard 
dragged his feet as he took the seat next to Donovan in front of the cameras. 
He inhaled through his nose 
and exhaled through his mouth as if he was back on the court, waiting for the whistle to shoot a free throw.
But the game was over. He 
scored 12 points on 5-of-9 shoot-ing and recorded a team-high seven assists and three steals in 34 minutes of work, another team-high.
Now came 
the hard part: an apology for his actions.
“I just 
wanted to start out by saying, I apologize for 
my actions over the summer and I apologize to the fans,” Wilbekin announced. 
“I already apologized to my 
teammates when it happened and I’m just glad to put that stuff behind me.”
For the second time in a cal-endar year, Wilbekin was forced to start his season after the rest of his teammates because of off-the-court issues. 
As a junior, he missed Flor-
ida’s first three games of the year by being suspended for violating team rules. 
A second similar incident 
occurred prior to this season, which cost Wilbekin the first five games of the season.
This time is different, Wil-
bekin said. He is not a kid any-more.

Losing is a tough pill to swallow.
After dropping only four games combined during the 
regular season and Southeastern Conference Tournament play, the Gators expected to play deep into the NCAA Tour-nament.
But Florida fell 1-0 in a second-round battle against Duke 
in Durham, N.C., on Friday night, making it the 10th straight season the Gators failed to advance past the Sweet Sixteen.
“It’s frustrating because we play games like that where 
they can go either way, and you just want them to go your 
way,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “I think that when you look at teams that are either still in the tournament and are advancing, and you know that you’re as good as those teams, that’s hard. “At the same time, it all comes down to what you do 
on that particular day. Duke did a terriﬁ  c job of hanging on defensively and they executed a really great chance to score a goal — we didn’t do that.” 
As difﬁ  cult as it is for UF to accept the end of the season, 
this year was a strong one for the 19-year-old program.
“When you look at just purely on the result, it’s hard to see 
that there was a breakthrough this year,” Burleigh said. “But 
what happened through the course of the year, there was.”
The breakthrough came in the form of Savannah Jordan.The freshman forward made an immediate impact, scor-
ing 22 goals this season — the second most by a freshman in program history. Jordan ﬁ  nished one goal shy of Andi Sell-ers’ 23-goal season in 1997.
Jordan is tied for third in the nation in scoring this season 
and is currently training with the U-20 Women’s National Team in Carson, Calif.
“Certainly, she progressed as the year went on, too,” Bur-
leigh said. “That’s not easy to do when you become a marked woman. Midway through, everyone knew that’s who [teams] were going to focus on.”
Then there is the anchor of the backline, sophomore Chris-
ten Westphal.
Unlike in her freshman season, Westphal helped the at-
tack, scoring her ﬁ  rst collegiate goal off a 40-yard free kick en route to a 5-1 victory over Georgia on Oct. 31. 
“If you look at the role that Christen Westphal played, 
even in this last game, we put her up top in [junior midﬁ  elder Havana Solaun’s] absence through a lot of that game,” Bur-leigh said. “That was something we had never done before.” 
The Gators expect to return all 11 starters from this season, 
and Burleigh said the team will continue to push the enve-lope.
“I think that’s a good foundation for us going forward,” 
Burleigh said. “It’s a bright future, it’s just really hard to focus on that right now.”
Junior undergoes surgery:  Solaun had knee surgery 
Monday to repair a torn right ACL she suffered in the SEC Championship against Texas A&M.
Burleigh said Solaun should recover and be ready to par-
ticipate in about six months. 
“Havana is a really disciplined worker,” Burleigh said. 
“When it comes to her rehab, I have no doubt it will be the same way. We’ve never had a player that hasn’t come back stronger in some way or another.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 2013

St. John’s may be coming to the O’Connell Center to-
night, but Florida will be looking for St. Anthony to ﬁ  nd 
its defensive game that has been missing this year. 
Poor defensive play has plagued the Gators so far 
this season. Florida allowed an average of 70.2 points per game through its ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games. It surrendered an aver-age of 64 points through its ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games last year. 
“We’re continuing to work really hard on our de-
fense,” coach Amanda Butler said. 
“That’s the area that we feel is our biggest weakness. 
We’re trying to ﬁ  gure out what works best with which ﬁ  ve. We’re trying to get individuals better at performing their jobs consistently at a high level. That’s our biggest challenge.”
After losing 76-68 to Florida State on Thursday, Butler 
is determined to get her team over the hump and start playing consistent basketball.
“You can’t cry too long over it at this point,” she said. 
“You’ve got to be ready to get your shoes tied up tight again and get back out for the next one.”
Florida has been outrebounded in the majority of its 
games. St. John’s is currently averaging 43.5 rebounds per game compared to Florida’s 35.2. 
In the O’Connell Center, Florida has outrebounded 
only Bethune-Cookman. 
Now, the Gators are again aiming to defend their ﬂ  oor 
and outmuscle the Red Storm. 
“We’ve been very inconsistent (in grabbing rebounds), 
so it has to be our focus and have our attention,” Butler said. “It just has to be a focus for us. It has to be something we’re paying attention to.”
Tonight, the Gators are presented with the tall task of 
trying to contain one of the game’s most proliﬁ  c guards — sophomore Aliyyah Handford. This season, she is av-eraging 25.8 points and 10 rebounds per game. 
“We’ve got to be ready for a very high-powered of-
fense, some individual scorers who are really, really im-pressive,” Butler said. 
“They have a lot of quickness, a lot of athleticism and 
they are a team that hasn’t been beat yet, so we have some great challenges ahead of us.”Florida looks to

that where they can go either way, and you just 
want them to go your way.”

UF coachMonday, UF moved the ball 
well early — unlike in its win against Middle Tennessee on Thursday. 
Wilbekin’s coach and his 
teammates noticed the differ-ence.
“I thought Scottie did a 
very good job shifting us in and out of offense, based on what he was seeing,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I thought that really helped our flow.”
Added Prather: “Just cut-
ting and slashing to the rim, having a point guard with great vision like that, he al-ways finds me. He’s just got a feeling, I guess. I don’t know what it is.”
Florida made 9 of its first 
14 field-goal attempts against Jacksonville to jump out to a 28-10 advantage with 10:47 remaining in the first half. During that opening stretch, JU (2-4) shot 30.8 percent from the field.
“We can’t really control 
if the ball goes in or out of the rim,” Young said. “Our defense has always been the strength of our team. If we can play great defense and then get the ball to go in, the (opposing) team has a whole lot to handle.”
Although Florida commit-
ted nine turnovers, none came in the game’s first 12:30. 
The Gators made 9 of their 
first 12 free throws but then went 7 of 16 from the charity stripe to finish the game.
The Gators trailed only 
once during the contest — about a minute into the game — and led by as many as 32 points in the second half.
After the game, Donovan 
announced that sophomore swingman DeVon Walker sprained a ligament in his right foot and will undergo X-rays today. Walker exited the game due to the injury with 15:29 remaining in the first half.
“It does not look like a 
high ankle sprain,” Donovan said. “I’m not even so sure if it’s an ankle sprain. It could be a sprained ligament in his foot. So, I don’t really know what happened to him. Other than that, he was pretty hob-bled there.”
Now, No. 15 Florida 
heads into a grueling four-game non-conference stretch against Florida State, No. 13 Connecticut, No. 2 Kansas and No. 21 Memphis. 
“It’s going to be a grind,” 
Frazier said. “That’s all I can tell you.”
Leading the pack at 64-35-5 is alligator-
Sports Assistant Editor Adam “Raised in a 
barn” Lichtenstein, who thinks rocking the shirt-tucked-into-his-jeans looks is proper formal attire. There’s no hope for you un-less you accidentally stumble into a Men’s Wearhouse. Maybe then somebody will ac-tually like the way you look, but we can’t guarantee it.
In second at 60-39-5 is alligatorSports 
Staff Writer Joe “I cheer for drug abusers!” Morgan, who wore a Justin Blackmon jersey on Sunday to celebrate the Jaguars’ second victory. Sources say Joe and Justin shared a celebratory bowl. Who knows what was in it. Also, the whole Jaguars fan thing is just downright pathetic. 
Back in third at 58-41-5 is alligator-
Sports Editor Phillip “I put the box office on my back” Heilman, who purchased four — FOUR! — tickets to see “The Hun-ger Games: Catching Fire” this weekend. We wish we could just blame this on some weird celebrity crush on Jennifer Lawrence or something, but you came home talking about Woody Harrelson both nights. No-body is that good of an actor, man!
First in the non-alligatorSports division 
and fourth overall at 55-44-5 is the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar “OMG! Im so sry u guys 4 real!” Thompson, who sent a mass email to fellow beat writers following a relatively minor shared transcription snafu. Good Lord, Edgar. Why were you so apologet-ic? You act like we’re your only friends or something. Oh...
Down in fifth at 53-46-5 is alligator-
Sports Staff Writer Adam “Hunger Games noob” Pincus, who tried to insert himself into a conversation about “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” by referencing drag-ons. This isn’t freaking Harry Potter, you incompetent dunce. There aren’t any freak-ing dragons in “The Hunger Games” tril-ogy, you obtuse ignoramus.
Tied for sixth at 52-47-5 is FightinGators.
com’s Cody “MIA” Jones, who we don’t even remember seeing at last Saturday’s game. Sad things is, we just now realized he wasn’t there. Or maybe he was. Oh, well. He didn’t miss much.
Also in sixth is InsidetheGators.com’s 
Bryan “Online journalism isn’t real journal-ism” Holt, who is relegated to the auxiliary press seats to cover basketball games while Pincus actually gets to sit on press row. A short guy like you is probably better off in the crow’s nest anyway. Making fun of your height is a low blow... because you’re short. And in dead-ass last with a piss-poor re-
cord of 51-48-5 is 247Sports.com’s Thomas “Loser” Goldkamp, who is in dead-ass last with a piss-poor record of 51-48-5. Like Florida’s coaches, it looks like film study isn’t helping you too much either.“I just learned the value of 
things and, in particular, just 
what an opportunity it is to play here at Florida,” Wilbekin said. “I think I’ve just matured and just grown up a little bit.”
Donovan, who said this would 
be Wilbekin’s last chance with the team, added he does not think there will be another rule-breaking incident. 
To Donovan, Wilbekin is a 
changed man with changed pri-orities but still the same skills on the court.
The offense recorded its best 
assist-turnover ratio of the sea-son Monday night against Jack-sonville, recording 19 assists and only nine turnovers. 
Not only did Wilbekin record 
the most assists by a Gator in a single game so far this season, but he also turned the ball over just twice.
Frazier said he could see Wil-
bekin’s newfound maturity in the locker room and on the court during the game.
“He was hyped up to play to-
night, but I think he did a great job of controlling his emotions and settling down and play-ing the game,” Frazier said. “He played great tonight.”
Polar opposite of the young, 
quiet Kasey Hill, who started in place of the suspended senior point guard until suffering a high left ankle sprain, Wilbekin did not shy away from being vocal with his teammates. 
He barked out plays, called for 
the ball and ran the Gators most efficient offense of the year.
“I felt very comfortable know-
ing that our experienced point guard is out there,” Young said. “No knock on Kasey Hill, but he’s only played about 3-4 col-lege games. Scottie’s played over a 100 in his career.”
Donovan would not say if he 
would cut Wilbekin from the team if he messed up again, but he added it would be his last chance.

Skyler Mornhinweg has the task 
of a lifetime. 
Florida’s third-string quarterback 
will likely be asked to start against 
undefeated No. 2 Florida State at home on Saturday with Tyler Mur-phy doubtful to play due to injury.
“I’m preparing all week like I’m 
going to be the guy,” Mornhinweg said. “We’re excited to play this game.”
That excitement could soon turn to misery for the 
Gators, who con-tinue to stumble through one of the worst seasons in program his-tory. 
Florida State, 
which is a win away from going 
12-0 for the ﬁ  rst time since its 1999 national championship season, is pummeling opponents. The Semi-noles have scored at least 40 points in every game this season. Juxtapose that against a Florida offense that is averaging fewer than 20 points per game, and there is ample cause for concern in Gainesville. 
Mornhinweg is not to blame. The 
redshirt freshman was unexpected-ly thrust into action when Murphy could not tolerate the pain stemming from a sprained AC joint he suffered against LSU on Oct. 12. 
However, Mornhinweg has not 
brought much to the table. In two games since replacing Murphy, he has completed 63.2 percent of his passes but is averaging just 114.5 passing yards per game in losses to South Carolina and Georgia South-ern. 
“I’ve got to execute better,” 
Mornhinweg said. “We’ve got to make some plays.”
Injuries: Florida continues to be 
eviscerated by injuries. 
UF will be without linebackers 
Michael Taylor (MCL sprain) and Alex Anzalone (shoulder disloca-tion) against FSU. Each suffered his respective injury during a loss to Georgia Southern. Taylor’s injury will not require surgery, but An-zalone’s will. 
Also expected to be sidelined Sat-
urday is left tackle D.J. Humphries, who continues to deal with the ef-fects of a sprained MCL.
“There’s some key components 
for our football team that aren’t playing for us right now,” coach Will Muschamp said. “We’re very thin in some areas. I’m not making excuses. That’s just the facts.”
UF is expected to have Marcus 
Roberson (ankle) and defensive end Jon Bullard (hamstring/knee) avail-able.

Florida State University is fa-
mous for its “Flying High Circus.” 
But another act in Tallahassee has become even wilder. Little talk in the college football world these days does not concern Seminoles redshirt freshman quarterback Jameis Win-ston.
The national spotlight is ﬁ  xated 
on Winston, who is leading No. 2 Florida State through a dream sea-son on the ﬁ  eld, while facing al-legations of sexual assault off the gridiron. But all the Gators see is another quarterback eager to tear apart their reeling defense.
“He’s a total package,” coach 
Will Muschamp said of Winston. “I don’t know where you start: his arm strength, he’s got a big arm; he can make all the throws. He has a tough throw. He can zip the ball in there.”
No quarterback in college foot-
ball zips the ball in there better than Winston, who leads the nation with a 194.51 passer rating and ranks ﬁ  fth with a 69.6 completion percentage.
Winston’s efﬁ  ciency is generat-
ing record results.
His 32 touchdown passes — al-
ready an Atlantic Coast Conference freshman record — rank third na-tionally, and his 3,163 passing yards are only 145 yards behind former FSU signal-caller Drew Weather-ford’s ACC freshman record of 3,208 yards through the air.
He also gets the job done with 
his legs.Excluding sacks, Winston has 
rushed for 310 yards and three touchdowns on 51 carries. But Win-ston is not a guy who just takes off and runs at the ﬁ  rst sign of trouble.
“He understands where he is 
taking the football,” Muschamp said. “He’s got really good pocket presence. He can hurt you with his legs. He’s a good athlete as well, but he’s a quarterback ﬁ  rst and that’s what you see with him.”
Defensive back Jaylen Watkins 
added: “He’s kind of like [Buffalo Bills quarterback EJ Manuel]. (Win-ston) can run a little bit, but deﬁ  nite-ly his strength is passing.”
But the comparisons of Winston 
to Manuel go beyond athleticism and playing style. Several Gators praised Winston’s ability to step in and assume a leadership role for FSU.
In his ﬁ  rst season of college foot-
ball, the Bessemer, Ala., native has led the Seminoles to their ﬁ  rst unde-feated road record in the ACC since 2000.
Winston’s ﬁ  rst victory away 
from Tallahassee was a 41-13 win against Pittsburgh on Sept. 2 in his collegiate debut. Winston com-pleted 25 of 27 passes for 356 yards and four touchdowns in a romp at Heinz Field.
He also shined in a 51-14 win 
against formerly third-ranked Clem-son on Oct. 19. Winston silenced the hostile Death Valley crowd of 83,428 with 444 passing yards and four total touchdowns. If Winston leads Florida State to another road victory on Saturday, he will help the Seminoles accomplish their fourth 12-0 season in program history.
“He’s a great leader,” Watkins 
said. “That’s the ﬁ  rst thing I noticed from watching their games. That’s probably his biggest attribute — as a leader to his team.”
While Winston and Florida State 
have been almost unstoppable this season, Florida has been quite the opposite. 
The Seminoles have scored 41 
points or more in every game this season, including an 80-point show-ing against Idaho last weekend at Doak Campbell Stadium. Mean-while, the Gators have scored only 94 points during their current six-game losing streak.
Florida State ranks second na-
tionally in scoring offense with 55.2 points per game, while Florida ranks 112th with 19.9. At its current scoring rate, the Gators would need to play 31 games to exceed FSU’s point total through 11 contests this season.
UF also trails far behind in total 
offense, coming in at 111th in the nation with 327.9 yards per game. Winston alone averages 299 total yards per contest.
“We’ve got to do a better job,” 
third-string quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg said. “It’s on us. We’ve got to make some plays, so we’re working hard this week try-ing to get back out there and pro-duce some points.”
But whether Saturday’s game is 
a shootout like last season’s 63-point affair or a low-scoring showdown like Florida’s 21-7 loss to Florida State in 2011, the Gators are conﬁ  -dent they can keep up with Winston and the second-ranked Seminoles.
“We deﬁ  nitely know we can 
compete with them,” Watkins said.
