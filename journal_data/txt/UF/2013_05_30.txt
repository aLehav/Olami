A community emergency 
exercise, which was post-
poned in April as a result of the Boston Marathon bomb-ing, will take place at UF be-tween 7 a.m. and noon.
The exercise will tempo-
rarily block access to campus near Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadi-um. Activity is also expected around the UF Health Science Center, University Police Chief Linda Stump wrote in an email sent to faculty, staff and students Tuesday.
UPD Spokesman Maj. 
Brad Barber said the full-scale exercise — which will include ﬁ  rst responders, university ofﬁ  cials, student volunteers and hospital per-sonnel — provides UF with a learning environment to practice emergency mass casualty plans, policies and procedures.  
More than 200 partici-
pants and observers are scheduled to attend, he said.
Volunteers will portray 
victims and be transported to emergency rooms includ-ing ones at UF Health Shands Hospital.
UF emergency manage-
ment coordinator Hal Grieb said once the “victims” ar-rive, doctors will respond to simulated injuries designed to mirror the ones that could result from a real scenario.
“The simulation will 
include mass casualty in-cidents,” Grieb said, “Any-thing that can range from cuts and scrapes to more se-rious incidents.”
The evaluation points for 
the exercise and the plan it-self are based on the public safety plan at the stadium and the comprehensive emergency plan at UF.
“Looking at community 
safety, certainly there are many challenges that are faced in the world we live in today,” Barber said. “These exercises help better prepare us to meet those challenges.”UF emergency

The 2013 hurricane season starts 
Saturday, and experts are predicting 
a stormy six months.
The National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration’s Atlantic hurricane season outlook estimated a 70 percent likelihood of up to 20 named storms, of which up to 11 could become hurricanes — includ-ing up to six Category 3s, 4s or 5s. The average, according to its website, is 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major ones.“This hurricane season is expected 
to be more severe than past years,” said Mike Spranger, a UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences pro-fessor in family, youth and communi-ty sciences who created a handbook about preparing for natural disasters. 
UF emergency management co-
ordinator Kenneth Allen said people should prepare by creating emer-gency evacuation plans, buying sup-plies and stocking up on at least three days’ worth of food and water.
In the event of a hurricane at UF, 
Allen said, on-campus residents liv-ing in dorms should follow the ad-vice of their housing staff. Off-cam-pus residents should follow protocols and guidelines from local ofﬁ  cials.
“The university is constantly 
working to keep the students, faculty and staff as safe and well-prepared as we can,” Allen said.
Hurricane season starts this weekend

Nearly 5,700 patients are at risk after a UF 
medical practice employee was discovered to 
have ties to an identity theft ring.
UF was notiﬁ  ed on April 11 about the inci-
dent by state and federal law enforcement of-ﬁ  cials. The statewide investigation is ongoing by the Ofﬁ  ce of the State Attorney, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Secret Service.
Melissa Blouin, UF Health Communica-
tions director of news and publications, said because the employee’s job dealt with view-ing medical records, any patient at UF Pedi-atric Primary Care Clinic at Tower Square, now known as UF Health Pediatrics — Tower Square, could be at risk.
According to a news release, the employee may have used pediatric patient records to steal per-sonal information includ-ing names, addresses, dates of birth and Social Security numbers.
Blouin said the name of 
the employee has not been released. But the employee was terminated, and law 
enforcement is taking action against the per-son, according to the release.
Secret Service Special Agent in charge Lee 
Fields said he could not comment on the case because it is ongoing. But he said identity theft cases are complex. It can take between nine months and two years to fully investigate and put someone through the criminal justice sys-tem, Fields said.
Earlier this year, about 14,000 Shands pa-

Gay Movie Night
On Friday at 7:30 p.m., the Pride 
Community Center at 3131 NW 13th St. will host Gay Movie Night with a showing of “Touch of Pink.” The movie is a comic clash of cultures, values and sexuality. Alim seems to have it all: a great career, a handsome boyfriend and a personal guide in the spirit of Cary Grant. And living thousands of miles from his mother, Nuru, and his family in Toronto, he can keep his lifestyle hidden. But when Alim’s conservative mom pays an impromptu visit with the intention of dragging her son to a big, fat, monsoon wedding and getting him matched up with a “nice girl,” the spirit of Cary Grant suddenly becomes indispensable. Gay Movie Night is a free service of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida. A $2 donation is requested to cover the cost of snacks.  For more information, visit www.gainesvillepride.org/gay-movie-night.
Life (and pet) planning seminar
On Tuesday from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Millhopper Branch Library, the Roark Law Firm will host a free and open discussion about wills, trusts, living wills, pet trusts and the other steps you can take to reduce the burdens created by the death or incapacity of a loved one. The firm will talk about what happens if people pass away or become incapacitated in Florida and also touch on a couple of the things that parents can put in place for their children. The talk will also focus on what people can do to better provide for the care of pets in the event of death or disability. Drinks and snacks will be provided,  and a Q-and-A session will follow the talk.

CorrECTI oN
A story in Tuesday’s paper 
included incorrect information about Craig Lowe’s time as a city official. He served as mayor for three years. His quote should read, “Over the last 10 years I was in office, we definitely set Gainesville on a great trajectory in respect to equal opportunity, environmental protection and economic development.”has climbed Everest twice, said things went well during their expedition because they carefully paced themselves, walking only half-days and resting in the afternoons.
“We just beat the monsoon 
season, and the typhoons are coming,” Miura said. “Thanks to good luck and careful preparation and planning, we all returned without any accidents.”
“We took our time. You get 
tired when you are old,” he said.
But Miura said he was 
dangerously weak at the beginning of his May 23 descent. 
Though he felt fine after he 
removed his oxygen mask on the summit to pose for photos and enjoy the view, he suffered for it on the way down.
“I lost strength in my legs,” 
Miura said.
Helped down by Gota and 
others, Miura revived after having some food and water at the team’s 8,500-meter-high base camp.
“He just wouldn’t give up. This 
is the real strength of Yuichiro Miura,” Gota said of his father’s recovery and persistence in traveling another 2 1/2 hours later in the day to reach their camp at 8,000 meters.
Miura was a daredevil speed 
skier in his youth, and skied down Everest’s South Col in 1970, using a parachute to brake his descent.
He also skied down Mount 
Fuji.
Though he says he does not 
plan another Everest attempt, Miura says he hopes to do plenty of skiing and to “live life to the fullest.”
“It isn’t just about staying 
healthy, but it’s about having goals,” he said.
“You don’t need to climb 
Mount Fuji or travel overseas. Just get out of the house. Enjoy good food. Those are the things we should do,” said Miura, who dined on hot pot and hand-rolled sushi and enjoyed gourmet Japa-nese green tea during his climb.
Miura expressed sadness over 
the disappearance Friday of a 67-year-old female climber while trying to summit Dhaulagiri, the world’s seventh-highest peak.
“Apparently, Kono just 
exceeded her limits and lost her strength,” he said. “It’s a real shame. It only takes one misstep. It’s really too bad.”

Colony of ants jam bell, keep German woman awake 
BERLIN — Disturbing the 
peace in a provincial German town: a colony of ants.
A 75-year-woman in the 
southwestern town of Offenburg called police at 3 a.m. Wednesday complaining that she couldn’t sleep because her doorbell was always ringing.
Police said officers dispatched 
to investigate the cause quickly tracked down the culprit: an ant nest next to the doorbell. They say the insects had built such a big home that the nest pressed the switching elements together, keeping the bell ringing.
Officers silenced it by 
removing the nest with a knife.
80-year-old says he nearly died on Everest descent
TOKYO — The 80-year-old 
Japanese mountaineer who last week became the oldest person to reach the top of Mount Everest says he almost died during his descent and does not plan another climb of the world’s highest peak, though he hopes to do plenty of skiing.
Yuichiro Miura, who also 
conquered the 29,035-foot (8,850-meter) peak when he was 70 and 75, returned to Japan on Wednesday looking triumphant but ready for a rest. He was sympathetic toward an 81-year-old Nepalese climber who on Tuesday abandoned his attempt to climb Everest, and break Miura’s record, due to worsening weather.
Min Bahadur Sherchan, the 
Nepalese mountaineer, faced difficult odds due to the brief climbing window remaining after delays in getting funding for his own ascent, Miura said.
“He is to be pitied,” said 
Miura, who had downplayed any talk of a rivalry.
Sherchan became the oldest 
Everest climber in 2008 at age 76 and held the record until Miura’s ascent last week.
The Nepalese climber said he 
slipped and fell just above the base camp three days earlier, hurting his ribs, so he was airlifted back to Katmandu, where he saw a doctor.
He plans to try again to regain 
his record, perhaps next year.
“I still have a few more years 
to make my attempts. I will try until I reach 84 and then quit,” Sherchan said.
Wednesday was also the 60th 
anniversary of the conquest of Everest.

UF will only cancel classes and close the 
campus if there is a real danger, university 
spokesman Steve Orlando said. He said be-cause UF is about 70 miles from the coast, storms in the past haven’t hit Gainesville too hard. 
“I feel that UF has a vast number of struc-
tures that can withstand hurricane-force winds,” said 21-year-old UF English senior Josh Olin.
Spranger said it is essential for students 
to be ready for hurricane season — the worst stretch of which occurs from August to October.
“Follow your instincts and always know 
you can never be too prepared for a natural disaster,” Spranger said. “Plan for the worst. Hope for the best.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 30, 2013

On Saturday, the Alachua Home Grown 
Open House will provide an opportunity 
to learn about gardening habits through hands-on experience. 
“There is a lot of interest within the 
community to learn about growing veg-etables,” said Aparna Gazula, commercial horticulture extension agent of the Alach-ua County Cooperative Extension Office, where the open house will be held. The event will be from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Demonstrations about everything from 
pond management to square-foot veg-etable gardening will be available. Classes about canning, attracting pollinators and integrated pest management will be of-fered free of charge but with limited seat-ing. 
“(The open house can) teach you how 
to better manage your vegetable insect pests with minimal organic pesticide ap-
plications,” Gazula said.The open house is intended for people 
to find out what the Alachua County Co-
operative Extension Office does and what educational programs it offers throughout the year. 
In the past, the open house has attracted 
a mix of residents from all over Gainesville, Gazula said.
The frost in Gainesville delayed the 
planting season that typically occurs in March. This means that even though the open house was slightly delayed, now is a good time for the square-foot vegetable garden to be in bloom. 
“Home-grown grilled vegetables go 
great with any meal,” said Tony Lozada, a 19-year-old UF economics junior.Open house hopes to teach 
residents about gardening
A similar incident occurred last year
tients were notified of a security breach after 
a different employee was linked to an identity theft ring.
Having not been the first incident of its kind 
at Shands, Blouin said the hospital is taking mea-sures to keep patient information secure. Em-ployees go through criminal background checks and training at least once a year, she said.
“People are very aware of the laws and the 
implications of even making a mistake can have,” she said. “We are asking employees to be vigilant and to report if they feel like somebody is looking at information that they don’t need to be looking at.”
Blouin said a letter has been sent out to pa-
tients and parents. UF will also offer fraud reso-lution services for up to one year.
“The university really regrets that this hap-
pened, and we are going to do our best to help the patients whose information has been affect-ed,” Blouin said.

The City Commission met 
Wednesday night to discuss amend-
ing an already approved process that would allow Butler Plaza to expand by about 150 acres and in-clude an upscale town center.
The plan, which would allow 
buildings up to eight stories high, divides the plaza and incorporates surrounding areas into four subar-eas.
The plan calls for large retailers, 
such as Walmart and Lowe’s, to move out of the current strip fac-ing Southwest Archer Road and to migrate to a new complex, slated to occupy the undeveloped area north of the strip toward Southwest 24th Avenue.
The current Archer Road strip 
would become a sort-of town cen-ter that would house small retailers and boutiques.
The goal for the developments 
is to achieve a balance of retailers, boutiques and restaurants to best serve Gainesville as  “a college town and emerging tech center,” said Gerry Dedenbach, director of plan-ning and GIS services at Causseaux, Hewett, & Walpole, Inc.
The proposed development 
would be walkable and pedestrian-friendly, he said, with reduced block sizes, more sidewalks and updated parking.  
Dedenbach showed diagrams  of 
historic U.S. communities to illus-trate the type of interconnectivity he hopes to foster through the project.
However, Commissioner Thom-
as Hawkins pitched an amendment that would standardize the block size within the development to less than 2,000 feet.
Mayor Ed Braddy described the 
proposed amendment as “a rigid conformity in all four areas.”
His motion was defeated, and in-
stead, the commission passed a mo-tion to cap the block size within the development at 3,200 square feet.
Engineering for the development 
will begin in the fall, Dedenbach said, and construction is scheduled to begin in January.
Once completed, Rebecca Mac-
cardini, a former chairwoman of the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the expansion will enhance Gainesville culture for stu-dents and their families.
“It’ll add convenience and expe-
rience, which is always important for students,” she said. 
However, Gainesville resident 
Becky Hart expressed hesitancy about expanding the plaza because she said it could create even more traffic problems.
“I have in recent years resigned 
myself to simply avoiding Archer Road due to traffic congestion.  It’s not worth it,” she wrote Wednesday in an email to city commissioners. “The expansion of Butler Plaza basi-cally doubles that issue.”
Commissioner Lauren Poe said 
the project has already been charac-terized by compromises.
“I don’t think there is anyone in 
this room that thinks this is the per-fect project,” he said.
Despite the lengthy discussion 
and compromises, Commissioner Yvonne Hinson-Rawls expressed optimism toward the project.
“I understand the need to have 
this high-profile gateway to not only attract shoppers but also tour-ists,” she said. “I’m excited about the possibility.”

The Duke Energy Foundation will award $45,000 to two 
charitable organizations in Florida — one of which is the 
Gainesville-based Consortium of Florida Education Founda-tions, which will receive $25,000.
“We focus our education giving on STEM-related projects 
such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics,” said Duke Energy Foundation spokesman Sterling Ivey.
Duke Energy is a nonprofit funded annually by shareholder 
funds and governed by a board of trustees, according to the company’s website. The Consortium of Florida Education Foundations helps more than 2.6 million students throughout Florida, according to the organization’s website.
“We’re the organization that supports Florida’s K-12 lo-
cal education foundation movement development,” said Mary Chance, president of the Consortium of Florida Educa-tion Foundations, which provides workshops for foundations throughout Duke Energy’s territory.
Ivey said the association will use the Duke Energy grant to 
encourage other businesses to support local education founda-tions and offer assessments for planning and building a budget. It plans to work on increasing the visibility of education foun-dations throughout the state so people know it’s an organiza-tion worthy of donation.
“Duke Energy has always been believers in local education 
foundations and helped us really reach out and develop educa-tion foundations,” Chance said.Group gets $25K“I’m excited about the

over. 
Keep working hard, Gators! 
To keep you nice and sharp on the heroes and villains of 
the week, we present you with...
Darts & Laurels
Heaven and hell almost had a very extreme 
rearrangement. 
Last week, the pope expressed rhetoric that had never 
been expressed by a head of the Roman Catholic Church. He seemed to say that everyone, even the atheists, are redeemed by Christ’s sacriﬁ  ce. 
In an effort to explain, or perhaps explain away, the 
Pope’s revelation, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, a Vatican spokesman, said that people who are aware of the Catholic Church “cannot be saved” if they “refuse to enter her or remain in her.” 
We issue a nice-try LAUREL to the pope. While we’d all 
like to be members and enter her, alas, it cannot be. 
On that note, the Boy Scouts of America recently lifted a 
ban on gay members. This deﬁ  nitely sounds like a change in the right direction, but we also wonder about the gay leaders and atheists who have faced rejection. 
It’s a toughie, but we give a LAUREL to the Boy Scouts 
for admitting that being morally straight doesn’t necessarily mean being straight. 
After a little more than a week of marriage equality 
in Minnesota, our favorite Minnesotan has decided she’s going to throw the towel in. 
Michele Bachmann announced Wednesday via a video 
on her website that she won’t seek reelection. We present  
the honorable congresswoman with a good-riddance 
LAUREL. 
Maybe she’ll start offering gay conversion therapy at 
her husband’s clinic to help cure her state. Any takers?
Our next laurel takes us to China, where a baby was 
recently pulled out of a sewage pipe. Residents heard the newborn’s cries and ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters had to saw the pipe open to release the baby. The process took almost an hour. 
Baby 59, as he’s being called, is now in stable condition. 
For exceptional perseverance in the face of death, we give Baby 59 a welcome-to-Earth LAUREL and wish his rescue 
crew well, too. 
We’d give you more, but all we have left is darts.Lee Rigby, a British soldier, was stabbed and hacked 
to death last week. The  assailants, who struck in broad daylight, are suspected to have been motivated by religious reasons. 
Whatever their reasons, we issue two DARTS into the 
hearts of Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. 
Killing people who had very little to do with your problem solves nothing. Winning their hearts and minds, though, might solve everything. 
Remember that, Gators, as you get through midterms!
Virtual vacay: from Afghanistan, with code
I embedded myself in Afghanistan last week to write an 
exposé for the Alligator. My adventures in Kabul were thrilling and, at times, dangerous. I would have felt 
honored being the ﬁ  rst UF student to report from a war zone — if the entire trip weren’t a ruse.
Actually, I tinkered with the code Facebook uses to pin-
point people’s locations, which let me “check in” from over-
seas. The check-ins, coupled with fake images and Wikipe-dia facts, made my friends think I was in one of the world’s most dangerous regions.
In this column, I’ll explain why I faked the check-in, and 
I’ll explore a security issue that relates to a February cyberat-tack against UF students.
First, I’m not a security expert. I’m just a programmer 
who tries to learn enough to secure his own apps. I won-dered how easily I could fake a check-in because my web-site, www.geopackages.com, uses a similar technology to locate people. Geopackages is a storytelling tool that lets UF students drop virtual packages full of photos and notes on campus. When you travel to fetch a package near Century Tower, for example, you unlock the memories inside it.
To promote this just-for-fun project, I planned to organize 
an event in which students raced to claim a far-away pack-age. Yet, before introducing a modest cash prize, I needed to know if anyone could teleport himself or herself to the ﬁ  nish line.
The Facebook experiment shows this can be accomplished 
simply and legally using browser plug-ins: Geolocater and User Agent Switcher. The ﬁ  rst helped position me at the Ka-bul Serena Hotel while the second made Facebook think my laptop was an iPhone.
Eager to continue the prank, I uploaded a picture of my 
girlfriend in an Indian restaurant in Gainesville. After search-ing Wikipedia for a popular Afghan dish, I typed, “Caitlin tries kichiri for the ﬁ  rst time.”
That’s when the phone rang. “You better be f------ kidding 
me,” my mom said, laughing. I explained the prank in pri-vate because I didn’t want to worry her, but I asked that she pretend I had traveled overseas as a journalist.
By then, some of my most tech-savvy friends believed I was in a war zone. A few called me a “bad a--,” a compliment that was probably unwarranted for a man who was eating a blueberry scone in Starbucks.
Students who aren’t techno-
logically inclined may wonder why this prank can’t be thwarted. To understand the security issue behind the scenes, consider the 
metaphor of a sushi bar.
You ﬁ  ll out an order slip and hand it to your waiter, who 
delivers it to the kitchen. A chef then sends back the appro-priate meal. Programmers would call the form a “front end” and the kitchen a “back end,” representing computers that process your requests.
Customers who are out of the kitchen staff’s view can 
tamper with the form. Computers are not always as percep-tive as humans when it comes to noticing strange requests. To make matters more complicated, your waiter may be an impostor.
This was the case in February, when an attacker sent an 
email aimed at stealing UF students’ information. The attack-er tried to dupe them into typing their passwords into a form that led to the wrong back end, according to a notice from UF Information Technology.
Because the front end is untrustworthy, the kitchen must 
have a way of verifying your order, so to speak. As of now, there’s no foolproof way for a website’s servers — the back end — to verify that someone hasn’t altered a location re-ported by the front end by a browser such as Firefox.
In a world where attackers try to exploit vulnerabilities, 
it’s nice to know loopholes can help us perform lighthearted magic.
As if protecting our personal info weren’t enough, learn-
ing about security grants us the superpower of teleporting from Gainesville to a Middle Eastern palace in the blink of an eye.

Cookie lovers, rejoice! It’s been a 
long time coming, but Midnight Cook-
ies has ﬁ  nally left its coveted spot in-side California Chicken Grill for a new location at 3345 SW 34th St. — just a few doors down from Tropical Smoothie Cafe. The owner of Midnight Cookies, Jonathan MacAllister, said the reloca-tion will attract more customers.
“We’ll have an actual storefront, 
which will be more noticeable and be able to attract the casual passerby,” MacAllister said.
As the scrumptious cookie shop is 
not a chain establishment, Midnight Cookies still offers a distinctive meth-od to the creation of its cookies. How-ever, instead of baking endless trays of cookies in hopes of selling them all in one day, the cookies are made to order. That’s right — fresh out of the oven just like your favorite pizza joint. This idea of fresh-baked cookies came from Jonathan MacAllister’s wife, Jennifer, who is also the co-owner.
“As she test-baked early on, we 
found that the taste of a fresh-from-the-oven cookie was so much better than cookies that sit in display for hours,” Jonathan MacAllister said. “The warm, melty goodness led her to suggest that we bake everything fresh to order.” 
April Burnett, an employee of Mid-
night Cookies, said that it is the fresh-ness of the cookies that makes their cookies stand out from others.
Midnight Cookies has a variety of 
cookies while at the same time keeping traditional ﬂ  avors for those not daring enough to try its ever-changing cookie creations. The traditional ﬂ  avors in-clude chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, snickerdoodle, peanut butter and sug-ar. Cookie creations at Midnight Cook-ies are one-of-a-kind treats that can’t be found anywhere else in Gainesville -- or anywhere for that matter. The key lime pie cookie, for example, is made with fresh lime juice, lime zest mixed with graham crackers, white chocolate chips and then topped with key lime pie ﬁ  lling. The birthday cake cookie is made with cake ﬂ  avoring, sprinkles and white chocolate chips.
However, what probably makes 
Midnight Cookies stand out from the rest is the fact that its dough is made from scratch in the store.
“Our cookies are original recipes 
made in-store from scratch,” Jonathan MacAllister said. “We had a competi-tor come in and ask us which compa-ny we order our dough from, and we had to simply point to some ﬂ  our on our clothes. Plus we feature so many unique ﬂ  avors you simply can’t ﬁ  nd anywhere else.”
John Lowery, a 21-year-old me-
chanical and aerospace engineering junior, said his favorite cookie is the cookies ‘n’ cream. 
“When you get it right out of the 
oven, it is soft and warm and the per-fect blend of crunchy cookie pieces and sweet cream,” he said. 
And what about vegan cookies? 
Don’t worry. Midnight Cookies has the perfect solution to making cookies that ﬁ  t your needs. Cookies can be tailor-made by simply replacing the butter with vegetable shortening and soymilk instead of eggs. Some vegan cookie op-tions include chocolate cookie crunch, which is a mixture of crushed Oreos in a chocolate-based dough topped with more crushed Oreos. A second vegan option, bananas foster, is a banana-ﬂ  avored cookie with a hint of rum extract, cinnamon and walnut. Not to mention this banana creation is topped with fresh banana and brown sugar for a caramelized topping.
So whether you like traditional 
cookie ﬂ  avors or fantastic original cookie creations that change as fre-quently as a college student’s mind, Midnight Cookies is the one place that offers delivery or pickup for uniquely delicious, warm, freshly made cookies that will get your taste buds tingling. Now it just has a shop all of its own.

livery options, deals or current ﬂ  avors, visit www.midnightcookies.com.

In the musical oasis “Avenue Q,” audience members step 
into a world reminiscent of their childhood days of watching 
“Sesame Street.” However, this is not a show for children.
The Tony award winning production “Avenue Q” will 
play at the Hippodrome Theatre, 25 SE Second Place, begin-ning May 29. Although this coming-of-age musical features puppets, it is geared toward an adult audience as it includes profanity and sexual content.
The plot centers on an apartment building in New York 
City where young adults, played by puppets, try to ﬁ  nd their purpose in life.
“Avenue Q” is making history because it is the ﬁ  rst joint 
production between the Hippodrome and UF School of The-atre + Dance.
Charlie Mitchell, co-director and professor of theater and dance at UF, said it’s amazing to have a resource like the Hippodrome. He said UF and the Hippodrome never had a chance to work together until now. 
Mitchell said one of the themes of the comedic musical is 
for people to stay in touch with their youthful core.
“Humor is the best way to get things across,” Mitchell 
said.
In the play, Grace Eunae Choi plays 
Christmas Eve, an engaged Asian woman with a very thick accent. She said it’s in-teresting to play a blown-up stereotype. She draws her inspiration for her character from her own mother and comedians like Margaret Cho from “Drop Dead Diva.” 
Unlike her other co-stars, Choi does not act with a pup-
pet, which comes with its own set of struggles. Choi said she has to remind herself to maintain eye contact with the pup-pet instead of with the actor who is holding it.
“I’m just glad I don’t have to hold those damn puppets,” 
she said.Tony award winning musical previews

Winter is coming.
Actually, you could say it’s coming to an 
epic end. The final episodes of the third season of HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” based on George R.R. Martin’s book “A Storm of Swords,” are supposed to be longer, crazier and more ac-tion-packed than ever, shot in such locations as Iceland, Morocco and Croatia. In fact, so many new characters and plot lines have appeared it’s not a guarantee that you will even see half of them in each episode during the third sea-son.
On Sunday, for the first time this season, 
there was a pause in airing due to concern that Memorial Day would affect the number of viewers — more than 5 million each week and increasing. This has left fans jonesing with an insatiable craving to know what the next — and last — two episodes will contain. This one-week hiatus not only provides an extra week to anxiously wait for Sunday and linger on previ-ous episodes’ content, but it also gives reprieve for those of you who are still catching up. Oh, and of course it’s to continue to loathe Joffrey with every word that leaves his puny, horren-dous mouth. You think you hated him before, but you haven’t seen anything yet.
If the first season introduced us to a pleth-
ora of sex, violence and corruption, this is the season of new relationships and weddings. The Lannisters will do anything in their power to keep family lines honorable and remain the cream-of-the-crop when it comes to royalty, even though two of Tyrion Lannister’s children are infamous for incest. Not to mention that de-spite the overwhelmingly central characters in the first two seasons — Ned Stark as the domi-nant male in season one and Tyrion taking over the screen in season two — the third season causes us to juggle more lesser-known charac-ters and storylines than ever before.
I don’t know about anyone else, but this in-
flux of new characters, such as Unsullied Grey Worm, Jojen Reed with his powers through dreams, sassy grandmother Lady Olenna from Highgarden and the “Boy,” who has made it a hobby of torturing Theon Greyjoy, has proved challenging to keep track of. Let’s be honest: There are way too many names to keep up with at all times. Khaleesi confronts a new territory and new leaders to take over every episode. But she is such a badass and has dragons — those creatures that were supposed to have died off long ago — by her side at all times. Who would mind keeping up with her anyway?
If you are playing catch-
up with “Game of Thrones,” I won’t spoil who exactly has gotten married, killed or al-lied with other characters this season. Some things are for certain, though: There is always a war going on. 
Always. You will never stop hating Joffrey. Never. Jon Snow remains gorgeous, although he is no longer traveling with the “crows” — which, if you ask me, was the best way to ensure his survival — and has taken on a red-headed lover. Jealous. And all the Stark chil-dren are still spread throughout the kingdoms, always shrouded by the glimmering hope that they will one day reunite under their fearless mother Lady Catelyn Stark and live happily ever after.
The last two episodes, “The Rains of 
Castamere” and “Mhysa,” will be sure to con-clude the third season with unexpected and shocking reveals that will leave us void of nails to further bite off as we watch every episode. Until Sunday, the anticipation creeps like a White Walker hunting a newborn.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
What’s the weirdest thing you’ve ever told a guy?Dear Friend,
Penis beauty is in the eye of the person holding your 
manhood. It depends upon a lot of factors including 
size, shape, color and if the gardener has been trim-ming the bushes properly. There is definitely such a thing as a beautiful penis, and a person should never be afraid to say so when one is spotted. It’s like com-plimenting a woman on her breasts. There are a lot of ugly one-eyed monsters out there, so even if one person has expressed their admiration for your penis, trust that your package isn’t a complete abomination. If you do have an ugly penis, you’ll probably be OK, but you will need the proper skills to cancel out your bone 
machine’s ugliness. 
 Dear Friend,
The friend zone is not forever. 
This misunderstood zone is not a place where you have no chance of dating or boning the person you want but rather a chance for you to grow on this person who could eventually re-evaluate you and put you in the bone zone. The friend zone has a 75 percent success rate, so do not fear this place or take it for granted. If a girl doesn’t want to sleep with a guy, it’s not because he’s her friend and she doesn’t want to hurt some imaginary friendship code, but it’s because she’s not sexually inter-ested or interested at all. I’ve dat-ed people who were once in my friend zone and so have others. Since the title “friend zone” is a little off-putting, I’ve come up with more appropriate names: warm-ing-up zone, possible friends-with-benefits zone, pre-bone zone and maybe-one-day-when-I’m-really-drunk zone. If the friend zone was really forever, it would be called it’s-never-going-to-happen zone. That zone is saved for people who suck, people you legitimate-ly do not like or those who have wronged you. There are dozens of zones, and the friend zone is 
not a bad place to be.Dear Friend,
No, laughing about the thought of a 
fart makes you an exceptional person. Farts are and will always be funny. I once farted from laughing so hard at an imaginary fart. It’s a vicious cycle. Even during the most serious situations, if one farts, you must laugh. If you’re in the middle of an intense breakup and one of you farts, you have to laugh. Even if you’re at a funeral and some-one passes gas while bending over the casket to say goodbye one last time, you must laugh. There is some-thing deeply wrong about trying to fight laughing when someone farts. Whether it’s a past, present, silent, loud, smells like sewage or even an imaginary fart, 
it is always OK to laugh.This column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 22-year-old majoring in international studies. Would

Ariel BarnesDear Mediocre Advice,
While I am fairly proud of my 
penis, I’ve been told it is ugly. 
Is there such a thing as a pretty penis? They all seem pretty ugly 
to me.Dear Mediocre Advice,
Is the friend zone forever?Dear Mediocre Advice,
Is it bad to laugh about farts you haven’t 
had yet, but might have in the future — like 
hypothetical farts?
Dear Friend,
If you think all of this is going to be sexy, you’re dead wrong. Let’s do this in a countdown form:
5. I want to lick your abs like a rack of ribs.4. Plough me like a corn field.3. You’re lucky your nickname is Whistle because whistles get blown.2. Don’t touch my seat — there’s butt sweat on it.
1. I have to poop first. Your toilet is not going to come back from this.

Armed with nothing but a gui-
tar, singer-songwriter Tristan Har-
vey crooned through his set Sun-day afternoon at The Jam on West University Avenue. Although he performed alone, Harvey’s musi-cal talents consumed the acoustics of the outdoor backyard stage as he delivered both covers and original funk, soul, reggae and folk-inspired songs to an intimate, engaged audi-ence. 
Harvey was one of many per-
formers to take the stage at The Jam during Memorial Day weekend as part of INfest, a Gainesville music and art festival that took place May 25 and 26. Organized by Chris Hor-rell, Lisa Smith and James McKay — a group that refers to itself as the Unindicted Co-Conspirators — INfest brought together an eclectic mix of sights and sounds largely representative of local talents who have been contributing to Gaines-ville’s creative scene for decades.
The two-day music festival dem-
onstrated diversity similar to that of Harvey’s song collection. From the Root Doctors, a Gainesville-staple with music self-described as “a tasty blend of old-school blues and psychedelic garage rock,” to the Bill Perry Orchestra, an amusing exper-imental project whose song titles include gems such as “Don’t Think About Sex in Public Bathrooms,” INfest embraced and encouraged avenues of imaginative artistry. The festival also reached out to performers beyond central Flori-da’s borders, including acts such as Nashville blues singer Nicolette Hayford -- a highlight of Saturday night’s events.
“The people who have put to-
gether the festival have either been playing music, going to shows or actually putting on shows for a long time now,” explained McKay, who is also the vocalist of Root Doc-
tors. “A lot of the bands that played here this weekend also play at a party that’s been going on in Gainesville since in the 70s. It’s a three-day 
party that’s held in various loca-tions, called the Boo Party, a kind of a Halloween party. We wanted to have an event here in town that was in the spirit of those.”
INfest also showcased the work 
of visual artists Jim Lantz, Catherine Lisle, Bill Perry, Amanda Samuels and members of SAW, the Sequen-tial Artists Workshop, a center for comic book artists. Attendees of IN-fest could peruse the artwork while nursing a pint of locally-brewed Swamp Head beer and listening to the live performances held inside The Jam’s newly-expanded stage and floor space.
Smith said that the foundation 
for the festival was largely based on bringing together musicians and artists who provide inspiration, en-tertainment and friendship to many in the Gainesville community. 
“We had been tossing around 
the idea for a festival like this for a while. Putting everything together mostly took place between the last month to month and a half,”  Smith said. She said diversity was key to this project. “(INfest organizer) Chris Horrell really wanted to make sure that we offered some-thing for everybody. From quiet to loud types of music, younger to older and more experienced bands, we wanted to attract a really di-verse group of people by providing something for everyone. By putting art into the mix, we were hoping to bring in people who are interested in that as well.”   
Finding the right venue to host 
artists and musicians befitting these criteria was key to INfest.  McKay noted that the now-closed Hard-back Cafe was once a legendary music venue in Gainesville that housed a wide range of music en-deavors throughout the years. It was important that INfest be held in a space that offered similar sensi-bilities as the Hardback. Although The Jam has been open for less than a year, it seemed like a great fit for the festival’s purpose.
“We wanted to put on the show 
at The Jam because it’s kind of a dif-ferent venue in Gainesville,” McKay said. “They have a lot of variety in the kinds of music that is performed here. They have both indoor and outdoor stages, and the people who run it are good people.”

With the popularity of electronic 
dance music right now, it’s easy for 
music lovers to obsess about the new products that DJs and artists are re-leasing. However, one band is mak-ing sure we don’t forget about the real meaning of electronic music.
Daft Punk, the French electronic 
music duo, recently released its fourth studio album, “Random Ac-cess Memories.” It hit No. 1 on the United Kingdom album chart, ac-cording to BBC Radio. It is becoming the fastest-selling album this year.
It became available for purchase 
Tuesday in the U.S. The album reached the No. 1 spot on the iTunes top albums chart — even ahead of the “Great Gatsby” soundtrack — in just a few days.
In its 13-track entirety, the col-
lection features loveable songs and mixes in a few genres, but overall it keeps a disco-poppy, old-school feel.
The first song on the album, 
“Give Life Back to Music,” describes the whole album. And the album’s first single, “Get Lucky,” has found a comfortable spot on the airwaves and on iTunes top singles listing. It is pretty catchy, I must say.
Overall, I would recommend 
this album for any techno or pop music lover. It is quite entertaining and keeps the listener’s attention by switching up the feel of each song. Definitely check out the single “Get Lucky,” featuring Pharrell Williams and my personal favorite, “Instant Crush,” featuring Julian Casablan-cas of The Strokes.
I give the album a B plus.12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 30, 2013

The day you graduate is the day you open 
new doors of opportunity and close the door 
on one chapter of your life. It is an inevitable occurrence to move into the real world with the knowledge you obtained and the friends you made an everlasting bond with.
Yet the trend I continue to notice among 
my graduating constituents is a massive slew of breakups occurring like clockwork each year at about this time. It’s as if graduation is the cancer of relationships. Everything is going well, and all of the sudden a healthy relation-ship is deemed worthy of ending its course. The countdown to graduation is simultane-ously the time left until the relationship’s ul-timate demise.
Relationships end for all kinds of reasons, 
and it’s always a difficult moment for both parties involved. However, a graduation breakup is sometimes the hardest to accept because a perfect relationship potentially has a definitive end.
For Nikki Schlanger, a 22-year-old alumna 
of the University of Central Florida, a gradua-tion breakup ended her two-year relationship with her boyfriend when he graduated a year before her. The idea of a long-distance rela-tionship was too much for both Nikki and her boyfriend as he considered his options for law school out of state. However, she said her boy-friend was basing his decision on where she would be located and not necessarily the best school for him. Eventually, they ended their relationship and went their separate ways. Their lives were continuing along two differ-ent paths that seemingly had no promise of ever crossing again.
“I just can’t imagine being in love dur-
ing that transition,” Schlanger said, “because I may not have moved to New York City to pursue my dream if I was still with him.”
The most important aspect I realized about 
Schlanger’s experience is that time heals all wounds. She was devastated at the time be-cause not only was she in a healthy relation-ship, but the relationship wasn’t ending on her terms. She wasn’t able to fully understand why this had to happen and certainly didn’t consider the potential good that could come out of the breakup.
Now that she too has graduated and has 
only her personal obligations to focus on, she is thankful the relationship did eventually come to an end. Sometimes life happens when you just aren’t ready for it, but you must have the ability to adapt and move forward.
If you’re going through a breakup right now due to graduation, have faith that every-thing will be OK. You may even be thankful for this in the long run. Regardless if your professional interests are different or if it’s just sheer distance itself that seperates you two, there may be a benefit you just aren’t seeing now to this relationship ending.
Right now, another per-
son isn’t holding you back during one of the most tran-sitional periods of your adult life. You are now able to take that job offer in Los Angeles with no hesitation because this is what you want –- not 
what someone else does. You don’t have to worry about what the other is doing and whom he or she is doing it with like you would in a long-distance relationship. You have a sense of personal freedom and discretion in your life that is uninhibited by another’s influence.
I will briefly digress and say I am a huge 
supporter of long-distance relationships, but it isn’t for everyone. It’s OK for a little bit, but it can’t be forever.
I could write a book on long-distance rela-
tionships, but for those who have yet to experi-ence a healthy one -– if any at all -– the thought can cause such anxiety and uncertainty with couples.However, I believe a long-distance rela-
tionship can only be a temporary solution. If you see yourself with your partner long term, you’re going to have to make an ultimate plan to relocate together.
But that’s the thing; if you don’t see your-
self with this person because of where they want to live, their professional goals, etc., then a long-distance relationship isn’t worth the mental stress and physical longing.
It’s normal for people to change and grow 
apart, and sometimes graduation can be the moment when one understands that. The guy you met freshman year may not be the same man he is today. And that is perfectly OK, but don’t stay with him if you just don’t like who he is now. He will never be the person he once was, and it would be a shame to stick around trying to find something that is no longer part of the present.
Bottom line: If you’re not gonna marry ‘em, 
then get the hell away from ‘em. So what if you have history? So what if that person is all you know? Life is a short journey that cannot be spent with someone who is not the partner for you anymore.
Long-distance relationships can work if an 
effort is made from both parties, and it’s only a temporary situation until you can ultimately be together.

With two outs remaining 
in the bottom of the seventh 
Sunday against UAB, fresh-man Kelsey Stewart made one of Florida’s biggest defensive plays of the year. 
Alabama-Birmingham had 
pinch runner Hailey Glynn at second with Lauren Webster stepping to the plate. Florida right-hander Hannah Rogers gave up a single up the middle to Webster on the first pitch of the at-bat, advancing Glynn to third. But Glynn – taking a risk – sprinted for home. 
“Every day in practice we 
go through game-winners, and Katie (Medina) and I went up to each other and said, ‘Game-winners,’” Stewart said. 
“Coach (Tim Walton) al-
ways hits balls at us like that in practice.”
Stewart dove to her right, 
fielded the ball and heaved it from her knees. Her bare-handed toss reached Aubree Munro’s glove as the fresh-man catcher tagged out Glynn for the win. 
“I thought it was going to 
go up the middle and then I actually thought [Stewart] over-dove a little,” Walton said. “She got a great jump off the bat and knocked it down. I was just hoping she wouldn’t throw the ball to first base be-cause there was no chance of getting her at first.”
“But it’s a closer play than 
it looks like because if she hes-itates or does the wrong thing, then they have a run. I’m re-ally proud of her for being heads-up and come looking for that out.” 
After Stewart’s play sealed 
No. 2 seed UF (57-7) a 1-0 Su-per Regional victory against Alabama-Birmingham and a trip to its fifth Women’s Col-lege World Series in program history, the Gators formed a dogpile on top of Rogers on the mound.
Stewart is one of Florida’s 
key underclassmen who have fueled the team to prominence in what was billed a rebuilding year during the preseason. 
Florida’s four freshmen in 
the starting lineup – Stewart, Kirsti Merritt, Taylor Schwarz and Taylore Fuller – have combined for 28 hits in eight postseason contests. 
But Walton’s young Flori-
da squad will be tested today at 2:30 when it faces seventh-seeded Tennessee (49-10) in the first game of the WCWS in Oklahoma City. Thirteen of No. 2 seed Florida’s 16 play-ers have never been to the WCWS.

Sophomore J.D. Tomlinson – the first 
round’s weak link – became Florida’s firm 
foundation on Day 2 of the NCAA Champion-ships in Woodstock, Ga. 
Tomlinson bounced back from arocky 
stretch of three bogeys in four holes at the end of his first nine.
The Gainesville native finished with three 
birdies on his second nine and ended the round tied for Florida’s lowest score with se-nior Tyler McCumber at 69 (-1). Tomlinson’s 11-shot improvement was the third highest of any player in the field.
“The difference between playing in the 
morning and the afternoon can be pretty sig-nificant,” coach Buddy Alexander said in a release. “There wasn’t as much wind and I thought the hole locations were a lot easier today.”
McCumber also took advantage of the con-
ditions, improving three shots from his first-round score and staying atop Florida’s team leaderboard with 141 (+1). 
Despite the improvements from both golf-
ers, their teammates didn’t show the same im-provement. 
Senior T.J. Vogel and Tom-
my Mou each duplicated their round-one performances, fin-ishing at 72 (+2) and 75 (+5), 
respectively. Sophomore Eric Banks shot one stroke higher in the second round, carding a 73 (+3).The Gators are 14 shots below the match-
play cutoff line of even par at the end of Round 2. After Florida’s play during Rounds 1 and 2 and only one round left in stroke play, today might be the last chance for Florida to compete this season. 
“It’s disappointing,” Alexander said. 
“When all three facets of the game are not par-ticularly good, it doesn’t matter how hard you try or how smart you play. You’re just not go-ing to get it done. That is what is happening so far.”

Last season, Jonathon Crawford 
made his NCAA Tournament de-
but in historic fashion.
Crawford took the mound in 
the Gainesville Regional against Bethune-Cookman and pitched the best game of his career. He tossed the first Florida no-hitter in 11 years and the seventh no-hitter in NCAA Tournament history. 
He faced the minimum 27 bat-ters – the one batter he walked was caught stealing – while throwing only 98 pitches.
The game set the tone for Flor-
ida, which went on to win its next four games in the regionals and super regionals before falling in Omaha, Neb.
Crawford will try to get the 
Gators started on the right foot again this posts”eason. He will get the ball to start Florida’s (29-28) matchup with Austin Peay (45-13) Friday at 1 in the first game of the Bloomington (Ind.) Regional.
“Everyone was kind of anxious,” 
Crawford said. “We didn’t really know if we were going to make it or not with the year we were having.”
Crawford comes into Friday’s 
game on two weeks’ rest – the right-hander’s last outing came against Georgia on May 16. Crawford likely would have made Florida’s second start in the Southeastern Confer-ence Tournament, but the Gators fell to the Aggies in the first round.

  It took sophomore Marquis 
Dendy three jumps instead of 
one to get to Eugene, Ore., for the 2013 NCAA Outdoor Champion-ships.
  Heading into Greensboro, 
N.C., for the NCAA East Pre-liminary Round, it was all but assumed Dendy would qualify for nationals in the men’s long jump – the event in which he is the reigning indoor Southeastern Conference and NCAA champi-on. He set the nation’s best mark in the men’s long jump at this season’s Clyde Littleﬁ  eld Texas Relays.
  However, Dendy missed the 
cut for his signature event. Af-ter fouling his ﬁ  rst two jumps, Dendy failed to improve on his third jump’s distance of 7.31m and ﬁ  nished 13th. He needed to make the top 12 to qualify. 
  “It was an up-and-down day 
for us,” coach Mike Holloway said of the ﬁ  rst day of competi-tion. “I spoke to our athletes and challenged them to come out here the rest of the weekend and re-ally stick their nose in there and compete.”
  Dendy still had a chance to 
advance to Eugene in the men’s triple jump. He stuck his nose in and competed. 
  On Saturday – the ﬁ  nal day of 
competition – Dendy redeemed himself. By ﬁ  nishing second in the men’s triple jump behind fellow Gator Omar Craddock, Dendy punched his ticket to Or-egom.
  “For Marquis to bounce back 
after a disappointment in the men’s long jump, it says a lot about his determination and work ethic,” Holloway said. “Omar was Omar and he delivered just like he does every meet. I’m very pleased with both of their perfor-mances.”
  With Dendy on board for 
NCAAs, the Gators will travel to Oregon with 28 athletes – the 
most qualiﬁ  ers 
in school his-tory. 
  Fifteen wom-
en and 13 men, including three relay squads, qualiﬁ  ed for the NCAA Champi-
onships. Florida’s 15 women sets a school record, while its 13 men is second most in school history. UF’s record for most men at na-tionals came in 2011. The Gators qualiﬁ  ed 16 that season. 
  Florida’s record number of 
qualiﬁ  ers can be directly attrib-uted to its strong performance at the NCAA East Preliminary Round.   Athletes needed to ﬁ  nish in the 
top 12 in their events during the preliminaries to qualify for the championships. On the ﬁ  rst two days, the Gators qualiﬁ  ed 11 ath-letes. On Saturday, the ﬁ  nal day of the meet, Florida advanced 17.
  “I’m extremely proud of all of 
our athletes who advanced to the NCAA Championships,” Hol-loway said. “It’s always great to have your teammates with you for the ﬁ  nals.” 
  Eight of the 28 athletes who 
advanced to Eugene are compet-ing in multiple events, including all four members of the men’s 400m relay squad. Najee Glass, Hugh Graham Jr. and Arman Hall are each competing in the men’s individual 400m, and De-dric Dukes is set to compete in the men’s 200m. 
  At this past weekend’s prelim-
inaries, the men’s 4x400m relay squad ﬁ  nished as the top quali-ﬁ  er with a time of 3:04.99.
  “This was their ﬁ  rst race since 
Texas Relays, and they did what they’ve done all year: They fol-lowed the race plan,” Holloway said. 
  Florida’s deep roster will 
serve as an advantage next week. Top teams are distinguished by the amount of points earned in the events. Athletes earn points if they ﬁ  nish in the top eight in their event, notching 10 points for a ﬁ  rst-place ﬁ  nish, eight points for second place, six points for third, decreasing to one point for an eighth-place ﬁ  nish. The more athletes a team has, the more points it can earn. 
  “We’re ready to get back to 
Gainesville and get to work,” Holloway said. “I’m proud of the way we performed and rose to the challenge after a few dis-appointments the ﬁ  rst day of the meet.”

THE RALLY
 
Following an early exit in the NCAA Region-
als in 2012, the Florida softball team was expected to have a down year. Sixty-four 
games later, the Gators are entering the Women’s College World Series as the No. 2 national seed. With Florida preparing for its ﬁ  fth appearance in the WCWS, alligatorSports editors Adam Lich-tenstein and Landon Watnick will decide which player was the most important in getting the Gators there.
    Adam: Clearly the Gators have a lot of 
good players. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t be going to Oklahoma City. 
  But the answer to this question is Kelsey 
Stewart.
  To understand why, we need to wind the 
clock back to the beginning of the season. The Gators were panned at the start of the year be-cause they lost a big chunk of their offense. 
  Senior Michelle Moultrie, arguably the 
greatest player in the program’s history, graduated after hitting .385 and knocking 22 homers in four years. Oh, and she stole 83 bases for good measure.
  Slugger Brittany Schutte left the team after 
suffering a career-ending injury.
  Then, right before the NCAA Tourna-
ment, UF suspended the Fagan sisters and Cheyenne Coyle. 
  The Gators needed someone to spark the 
offense. Stewart did exactly that and did it quickly, going 10 for 18 in her ﬁ  rst weekend of college softball and never looking back. 
    Landon: Every young team in the post-
season needs a seasoned veteran. The Gators have found their’s this year on the mound.
  Junior right-
hander Hannah Rogers has been the driving force behind this team in 2013 – especially in UF’s past eight contests. When Florida’s under-classmen made uncharacteristic errors in the NCAA Tournament, Rogers remained cool and collected. 
  This season, Rogers has tallied an ERA of 
1.48 – 15th in the nation. Thanks to her effec-tive pitching, Florida is ranked eighth in the country with an ERA of 1.68.
  She also has 238 strikeouts, which is 33rd 
nationally. Her 33 wins, maybe the most im-pressive number of all, tie for third in the country.
  On Wednesday, Rogers was named to 
the National Fastpitch Coaches Association’s All-American First Team along with sopho-more Lauren Haeger. I didn’t see Stewart on that list. 
  Rogers may not be the MVP of the press 
conference (Her most introspective response this year has been: “I just stayed conﬁ  dent and knew that my team was behind me.”).
  But she’s certainly the main reason why 
Florida is 57-7, a No. 2 seed in the WCWS and only ﬁ  ve wins away from its ﬁ  rst national title. 
    Adam: Stewart is a better quote and a bet-
ter athlete. Have you seen her run? She hits a chopper that you’re sure is going to be an easy groundout, and she’s already run-ning past the bag by the time the ball reaches ﬁ  rst. 
  And when she 
gets on base, look out. She’s been in-credibly valuable 
for Florida on the base paths. Her 36 steals are the most in Gators history, breaking the record set by none other than Moultrie. And I wouldn’t be surprised if she smashes that record again next year.
  Stewart’s speed has contributed to many 
of Florida’s rallies this season. She turns sin-gles into doubles and scores from second on any hit into the outﬁ  eld. 
  She even hit an inside-the-park homer ear-
lier in the year. That’s just exciting.
  Lauren Gibson is the second baseman on 
the All-American team. She hit .407 with 18 homers. That’s just ridiculous. Gibson’s in-credible season doesn’t diminish what Stew-art did for UF.
  Landon: Adam, I didn’t see you at last 
weekend’s Super Regional games. While you were soaking up the sun and kayaking at Si-esta Key, I was schvitzing my butt off in the Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium press box. 
  I know you didn’t catch Rogers’ consecu-
tive complete games, or her 11 scoreless in-nings.
  Sure, Stewart made a fantastic play at the 
end of Game 2, but she went 1 for 6 at the plate against Alabama-Birmingham. The freshman second baseman hasn’t recorded an RBI in the NCAA Tournament. 
  Don’t get me wrong – Stewart has been 
pretty good recently. But she hasn’t been Florida’s best athlete.
  In two contests facing the Blazers, Rogers 
fanned 11 batters, walked six and allowed only three runs. 
  This postseason, she has pitched 41 of 
UF’s 54 innings – allowing 2.21 earned runs per seven. Against some of the nation’s best squads, that’s terriﬁ  c. 
  Rogers has been so durable and reliable, 
No. 2 pitcher Lauren Haeger hasn’t even seen the mound during NCAAs, letting her focus more on her hitting. 
  I know this is petty, but after Stewart’s 
gem to seal the UAB series, the Gators formed a dogpile on top of Rogers – not Stewart. 
    Adam: Although I may not have been in 
town this past weekend, I did catch the entire softball season. And while Rogers pitched a lot, she wasn’t out there every day like Stew-art.
  Stewart started every game and was con-
sistent throughout the season, leading the team in batting average for the entire year.
  Her on-base percentage is third on the 
team. Florida needs people on base – solo Haeger bombs don’t get the job done. 
   Rogers is great, but even she can’t win 
without runs. 
  So while the Gators dogpiled Rogers, they 
would have been sitting on their couches watching the WCWS if not for Stewart.

Junior has not pitched since win against UGA on May 16
  “We couldn’t schedule any other 
games,” O’Sullivan said. “We tried 
to simulate practices and scrim-mages like they were real.”
  Added Crawford: “We’ve just 
been coming out every day, just working hard, practicing just in case we did make a regional.”
  Crawford said he is ready to pitch, but his last three outings have modeled the inconsistency of his season. 
He pitched well against Georgia 
in his last start, going 6.2 innings and striking out ﬁ  ve while only giv-ing up one earned run.
  And on May 2, he held No. 4 na-
tional seed LSU to two runs in a 3-2 loss in Baton Rouge.
  But between those two starts, he picked up a loss after surrendering four runs to Auburn in four innings of work. Auburn did not get a berth in the NCAA Tournament.
  “What you’ve done in the past 
doesn’t matter at this point,” O’Sullivan said.
  But this year has been a differ-
ent experience for Crawford. 
The junior spent two seasons 
in a smaller role for the Gators, with more experienced pitchers like Hudson Randall and Brian Johnson in the rotation ahead of him.
  Crawford 
was expect-ed to bear a heavier 
load in 2013 and anchor a staff that lost ﬁ  ve pitchers to the MLB Draft. The situation was exasper-ated when juniors Karsten Whit-son and Keenan Kish suffered injuries early in the year. 
  Much like the rest of the team, 
the right-hander struggled to ﬁ  nd consistency. He currently has an ERA .90 higher than in his sopho-more campaign (3.13).
