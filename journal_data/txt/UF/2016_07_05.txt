Sai Krishnamoorthy experienced 
his ﬁ  rst American celebration of In-
dependence Day on Sunday. 
Krishnamoorthy, a 23-year-old 
UF computer engineering graduate 
student, worked at Fanfares and 
Fireworks as an employee of the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
He previously celebrated Indian 
Independence day each August in his home country, where people gather to see an inspirational lead-er and talk about freedom, Krish-namoorthy said.
“I’m most excited about the ﬁ  re-
works,” he said. “Back in India, we don’t celebrate Independence Day with ﬁ  reworks. They don’t invite bands — it’s not like this.”
Throughout the event, which 
began at 7 p.m. and ended at about 10 p.m., about 600 visitors snacked on funnel cakes and cotton candy 
as they listened to local bands. 
Bears and Lions and Gainesville 
Community Band performed after 
making an appearance last year, and The Savants of Soul joined this year’s lineup.  
University Police Ofﬁ  cer Tiaun-
she Brown, 24, said she usually hears the ﬁ  reworks from her home.
This year, Brown’s job brought 
her to the event for her ﬁ  rst time. 
“We have a good group of peo-
ple — not much to worry about,” she said.Alex Klausner, the 26-year-old 
drummer for The Savants of Soul, said he usually celebrates Indepen-dence Day with friends.  Sunday was the band’s ﬁ  rst time 
celebrating the holiday together, he 
said. 
“It’s always great to see the wide variety of people that are out 
here to celebrate,” Klausner said. 
“Not all of Gainesville events are  
like this.” @jesskorina

UF Health is leading a group of nearly 
45 centers across the country in the larg-est comparative study ever done on hepa-titis C.  
UF researchers have just found their 
ﬁ  rst patient, who will undergo a 12-week drug treatment plan throughout the re-
search, known as the Prioritize Study, ac-
cording to a release.
The study will take place over the next 
ﬁ  ve years and is expected to have 3,750 patients across the nation. UF Health an-ticipates it will have about 200 partici-pants, said Dr. David Nelson, the princi-pal investigator for the study.  
Each participant will randomly receive one of three drugs, and all participants will be given free viral testing, Nelson said. 
The trial is funded by a $14.97 mil-
lion research contract from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute according to the institute’s website. UF, the University of North Carolina, the Uni-versity of Michigan and Johns Hopkins Hospital applied for the grant together in 2015.
Any patient with hepatitis C has an 
opportunity to participate in the study, Nelson said, which he believes will make the results a more accurate representation of the population.
Aside from discovering which drug 
works best, Nelson said he hopes the study will help answer more complex questions, such as ﬁ  nding out if the liver improves after the treatment and how the treatment affects the rate of liver cancer.
Hepatitis C currently affects an esti-
mated two percent of the U.S. popula-tion, which is about ﬁ  ve million to seven million people, Nelson said. The virus is the leading cause of liver cancer and liver transplants, and it causes about 20,000 deaths in the U.S. each year, he said. 
Despite the large number of people 
impacted, Nelson said he feels optimistic 
for the future of treatment.  
“There are just so few diseases we can 
cure, and this is one of them,” he said.  
Summer Wadsworth had hepatitis C 
for about 25 years. After being cured, she 
became the co-chairwoman of the patient engagement group that works with Nel-son’s research team.   
“This is a study for patients, by pa-
tients,” Wadsworth said.  
She said the trial is not only about 
testing the effectiveness of the medicine, but also about what is going on in the in-dividual, something she can personally relate to.   
“I didn’t know how sick I was until I 
wasn’t sick anymore,” she said. 
With advertisers raising awareness of 
hepatitis C and with studies uncovering 
new information, Wadsworth said she 
believes the virus’ days are numbered.
“I think the push to get people tested 
and then treated could really have a signif-icant impact on eradication,” Wadsworth said, “and that would be awesome.”

Services that send clothes to peo-
ple with a subscription already exist, 
but thanks to a UF graduate, there is now a service speciﬁ  cally for college-oriented outﬁ  ts.
About three weeks ago, UF me-
chanical engineering alumna Paula Pettit founded Parcel22, a Forever 21-style clothes subscription site. The service costs 
$49 per month and allows users to try a variety of clothes for as long as they like, with the option to buy them at a dis-
counted price.The 23-year-old said she used a 
similar service, which provided busi-ness-casual clothing, while work-
ing an internship. After returning to 
Gainesville, she found there were no similar services for more casual, cute clothing, she said.
After subscribing, customers 
ﬁ  ll out a brief survey, then scroll through a list of inventory in an Instagram-style website where users can then “like” different outﬁ  ts and accessories. 
From there, three clothing items 
and two accessories are picked for each user, Pettit said. 
The style of clothes is marketed 
toward 20-somethings and is based on trends found on Instagram and around Midtown, she said. 
Shortly after the service launched, 
incoming UF freshman Valeria Bar-reto signed up.
Barreto said she has received two 
boxes since starting, and that she 
plans on keeping the subscription 
through her ﬁ  rst semester.
“It’s totally worth it,” the 18-year-
old said. “I know a lot of people that go shopping and spend $50 on three tops. You can get endless amounts of clothes as soon as you return it, and you just pay 50 percent of it.”

The newly renovated Reitz Union 
is currently taking a lead in a state-
wide competition honoring the most 
inspiring and unique buildings in Florida.
As of press time, the Reitz is No. 2 
on the 2016 People’s Choice Award’s Top 10 list. Savion Park Apartments, 
located at 721 SW Fifth Ave., is cur-
rently at No. 3 and St. Peter’s Angli-can Church in Tallahassee is at No. 1. 
The Florida Foundation for Archi-
tecture, a nonproﬁ  t founded by the Florida Association of the American 
Institute of Architects, sponsored the 
event, which includes 39 buildings. 
The voting opened June 22 and 
will remain open at aiaﬂ  atop100.org until July 22 at midnight, said Can-dace Munz, the manager of commu-
nication for the association. 
People from all over the world 
have the opportunity to choose from the different Florida buildings.  In 
2015, Munz said, approximately 560,000 votes were counted from 
more than 40 states and 120 coun-
tries. 
“Of course, we are always hope-
ful that this will increase and we will see even more participation this 
year,” she said.
Munz said the People’s Choice 
Award is meant to help the public ﬁ  nd a greater appreciation for architecture. 
“The contest was designed in an 
effort to share the great architecture 
of Florida with its residents and with 
those who visit our state,” she said. Thirteen local chapters of the as-
sociation picked the contest’s fea-
tured buildings, which must be a public space in Florida that has been 
built or renovated in the last ﬁ  ve years, Munz said.
The winners, she said, will be 
honored at the AIA Florida Conven-
tion and Trade Show in Palm Beach 
and will receive the opportunity to 
host an event for the public to tour the winning buildings and meet the 
architects.
“We want to give these buildings 
the opportunity to showcase their de-sign to the public and really engage 
with the architects behind it all,” Munz said. 
Eddie Daniels, the executive di-
rector for the Reitz, said he is pleased to see the building featured. 
“It is exciting to know that the Re-
itz is being recognized in this way,” he said. “When other people see how 
attractive and functional that it really 
is, that’s a huge honor.”
UF President Kent Fuchs called it 
the “queen of the campus” at a rib-bon cutting ceremony for the newly renovated union in February. 
This would be the third award the 
Reitz has won since it was remod-eled last semester, Daniels said. The 
building has received Gainesville’s 
annual City Beautiﬁ  cation Award and the New York City Urban Green 
Council’s  Power to the People EBie 
award.  Statewide contest highlights several Gainesville buildings

The first-ever Kops and Kids field 
day, hosted by PACE Center for Girls 
Alachua, was met with several sur-prises Friday. 
Heavy rain forced about 50 girls 
and a group of officers and deputies from Gainesville Police and the Ala-chua County Sheriff’s Office to meet at the center on Southeast Fourth Avenue rather than Greentree Park.
As the rain interrupted a tug-of-
war match, everyone moved inside, where Executive Director Natalya Bannister danced with the girls.  
“Some of our girls have a nega-
tive perception of officers in our 
community, and we are looking for 
creative ways to help them bridge that gap,” she said.
Bannister said the tug-of-war 
match, along with sack races and a dance off, brought another surprise.
“At first it was cops against kids, 
but they ended up working togeth-er,” she said. “It wasn’t really part of 
the plan, it just kind of happened.”
Khamani Young said the center 
gave her a more positive outlook on 
life.“Before I came here, I would skip 
school,” Young said. 
“I can’t just throw my life away, 
playing around,” she said. “I need to get serious. I’m trying to go to col-lege soon.” 
GPD Officer Dontonya Smith said 
the rain changed Kops and Kids from an outdoor field day to an indoor party.
“We showed them we can dance, 
we can play, we’re moms, we’re sis-
ters, we’re friends,” Smith said. “It 
kinda humanizes us to the kids.”

Teaching comes naturally to Ty-
ler D’Angelo. 
One minute, the UF senior can 
dazzle a middle school student with the promise of a Reese’s Pea-
nut Butter Cup after a lesson. The 
next, he can explain career place-ment and job security to a college freshman. 
That’s the nature of the job 
for D’Angelo, who was recently named one of 12 National Teach Ag Ambassadors.
“It was a moment of pride and 
a moment of awe as I watched him work,” said Brian Myers, a UF pro-fessor of agricultural education and communication. Myers nominated D’Angelo for the ambassadorship. 
“He was doing what he was de-
signed to do, and it was something to behold.”
What Myers said he was “be-
holding” was D’Angelo, a 21-year-old studying agricultural educa-tion, effectively explaining his field to moms, kids and everyone in be-tween at conventions. 
That natural ability to teach ev-
eryone about agriculture is one of the main reasons Myers said he nominated D’Angelo for the award 
— along with the fact he seems to 
feed off the atmosphere of his job. 
“He was energized by people 
coming up and talking to him,” Myers said. 
As a Teach Ag Ambassador, 
D’Angelo’s teaching skills will be put through new, increasingly rig-orous tests. He has to teach com-
munity agriculturalists about the 
Teach Ag campaign. He has to con-tinue convincing middle- and high-schoolers why teaching agriculture is important. He has to lead webi-nars, travel and 
hold discussions 
with agricultural leaders. 
And he has 
to do all of that 
while he’s a full-time student. 
“I’m a little nervous, yeah,” he 
said. “I think that comes with the 
territory. But I’m really excited.”
While D’Angelo said he has a 
passion for the importance of ag-
ricultural education, his interests don’t stem from growing up on a farm. 
Instead, D’Angelo said he found 
DeLand High School’s branch of the Farm Service Agency entirely 
by accident.
Accident or not, D’Angelo said 
FSA sparked his interest in teach-
ing agriculture, and by the time he was a high school senior, he knew that’s what he wanted to do. 
Three years after his realiza-
tion, he applied for the Teach Ag Ambassadorship, which selects 12 
ambassadors out of the 120-or-so 
applicants, he said. After a three-month wait, D’Angelo received an email saying he was chosen.
“All I could think about was, 
‘Wow, who do I tell first?’” he said. 
Now, D’Angelo said he’s fo-
cused on getting back to his work — work that will take over the next 
year of his life. 
“What I really want to do is not 
only promote my degree and get 
students interested in being in ag-riculture education,” he said, “but ultimately understanding the im-portance of agriculture.”

ColumnJuno what we are 
saying?
So much news has happened. We can’t get to everything, 
but we’ll touch on a lesser-known thing and then a something-that-should-be-discussed-more thing.
Technology: It’s beautiful, even if new breakthroughs 
in our digital age often seem pointless or counterintuitive 
— like Android’s big announcement for its soon-to-be-released 7.0 software update “Android Nougat.” It’ll supposedly feature a smoother interface and a cool new feature of opening two apps at once. We’re for sexy new features and all, but let’s get real: It’s time we start getting phones that can last more than 30 minutes without dying. Give us better battery life or give us death (#backtothebasics). 
Anyway, as we were saying, despite these trivialities, tech-
nology can be awe-inspiring. We’re witnessing such a devel-
opment with NASA’s Juno spacecraft. Launched from Cape 
Canaveral, Florida, in August 2011, Juno was set to land in Ju-piter’s atmosphere July 4.
Now, we published this paper before Juno’s live feed of its 
entrance was broadcast, so we can’t write on the success or fail-ure of the landing. However, if successful, Juno’s set to spend an entire year orbiting Jupiter, collecting invaluable data about its atmosphere, the Big Red Spot... All the secrets you can know about a planet.
And even if this $1 billion mission narrowly misses Jupiter 
and trails off into the great abyssal unknown — better-known as New Jersey — scientists have already unearthed a mini suc-cess. Juno audio-recorded its plunge into Jupiter’s gargantuan magnetic field, and the recording is now free on the internet. It goes well with herbal tea and Pink Floyd — or some Radiohead.
Now, for those of you who wonder, “Why are we spend-
ing so much money sending stuff into space when we have all these problems down here?” understand all these things are 
connected. This concern is completely within reason — no one 
likes wasting time or money.
But recognize great developments in medical science have 
their basis in space exploration. The MRI example is famous, but as for a more recent example, in 2012 scientists officially coined a treatment for post-childbirth complications that often affect mothers in third-world conditions. Inspired by the anti-gravity suits astronauts use to re-enter orbit, medical practi-tioners can use pressure suits to alleviate, and even cure, the 
bleeding from these potentially fatal defects. Cool, huh?
So, now onto the topic that ought be discussed more: Iraq. 
Early Sunday morning, a suicide truck bomb ripped through 
a busy market area in Baghdad, resulting in what CNN World News reported as, “the deadliest single attack in Iraq’s war-weary capital in years.”
The blast killed more than 200 and wounded around 175, 
and some families are still searching for their relatives in the rubble. This attack came in the same week as the Ataturk Air-
port attack in Turkey and an attack in Bangladesh’s capital city, 
Dhaka, in which gunmen killed 20 hostages and two police of-ficers.
Many on social media are criticizing the West for not re-
sponding to these attacks as it did with the attacks in Paris and 
Brussels. We at the Alligator agree, though we’re not surprised. On the one hand, the West generally presumes that conflict is inherent to that region of the world. Furthermore, the major media outlets are primarily ratings-driven. As a result, these tragedies get mentioned briefly but are then drowned out by the latest election coverage or celebrity gossip.
With this in mind, it is incumbent upon we the people to 
sympathize with the victims and raise our voices on our own 
terms. And rest assured, we at the Alligator will be right there with you.On kindness, Cleveland sports and the LSAT
For the last six months, I have been study-ing intensively for the LSAT, or the Law School Admission Test. Between logic classes, practice exams and nightly re-search on what fields other than law in 
which a philosophy major can find a career, I found refuge where I had always found it: Cleveland sports. My family is from Cleveland. Whenever I would go there, my uncle and I would go to various sporting events. Some of my most cherished memories include watching the Cleveland Indians lose, watching the Cavaliers lose and watching the Browns lose.
My LSAT was supposed to be June 6. Due to a tropical 
storm that never hit, the exam was canceled halfway. We had to come back two weeks later to retake it. The night before, the Cavaliers had lost their second championship game to the Golden State Warriors.
On the sixth, after driving through the drizzle from the 
exam location to my friend’s house where I was staying, I did what any sensible Cleveland sports fan and college-aged test taker, who experimented with six months of so-briety in order to study for arguably the most important 
test of his life, would do: get drunk and sleep on some-
one’s floor. In my drunken stupor, I did something I had never done before: I made a deal with God.
I am a skeptic. I have “struggled” with my family’s 
Judaism from the start (I was 8 days old when they re-moved my foreskin). If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the NBA Championship, and if I score well on the LSAT, I will go to a Friday night Shabbat service.
Two games passed, and the Cavs had won one game 
and lost another, resulting in a 3-1 situation. To recover and win, the nation’s expert basketball analysts agreed, would be nothing short of a miracle. It seems my skep-ticism was justified, and God remains a manifestation of our strange desire to find meaning in a universe that is clearly devoid of it. Or God had simply neglected my prayer the same way He neglects the prayers of (insert tragedy here). One of The Onion’s greatest pieces is titled, “God Answers Prayers Of Paralyzed Little Boy. ‘No,’ Says God.”
Time passes. Cleveland shocked the world. 
More time passes. I was pleasantly surprised with my LSAT performance.
Last Friday I sat uncomfortably in a syna-
gogue for the first time in more than eight years. The rabbi approached me after the service. I opened up and told him my relationship with Judaism (or lack thereof), my personal politi-cal take on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (I’m a 
minority in the Jewish community) and my, more or less, abandonment of the faith after my bar mitzvah.
The rabbi, politely trying to mask his disappointment, 
told me I was always welcome at “our” synagogue for a meal, a service, a chat — you name it. His hospitality was as overwhelming as it was undeserved. Some fellow Jews have called me a “traitor” or a “self-hating Jew.” Non-Jews have called me a “kike” or a “Heeb.” None of those had ever struck me the way this rabbi’s kindness had.
On July 4, the political debate between my friends and 
me endured as it always has. Talks of terrorism, xenopho-bia, self-defense and religious extremism were discussed 
ad nauseum. There was an eerie patriotic irony as they 
talked of things they hate (liberals, conservatives, Trump, Hillary) around things they love (hot dogs, pool toys, beer).
That rabbi and I disagree on every conceivable facet of 
existence. On topics of religion, politics, lifestyle, moral-ity, etc. that rabbi and I will never find common ground. But, for a brief moment, something made me forget all of that. Something reminded me that, despite our fundamen-
tal differences, we are all struggling together, each and 
every one of us: Jew, Muslim, Democrat and Republican alike. In this struggle, we find differences in attempts of solvency. Sometimes these differences are vastly divisive.
They don’t have to be.

You do what? Isn't it bloody? How 
do you clean it?
These are the common ques-
tions I get when people ﬁ  nd out I use a menstrual cup.
According to Wikipedia, a menstrual 
cup is a type of feminine hygiene product usually made of medical grade silicone, shaped like a bell and is ﬂ  exible. It is worn inside the vagina during menstruation to catch menstrual ﬂ  uid.
Menstrual cups come in many different 
shapes and sizes, and the DivaCup website promises 12-hour leak-free protection, ab-
sorption up to three times that of tampons 
and at least one year of use.
I switched to menstrual cups and cloth 
pads after I got the birth control implant 
Nexplonon. About a week after getting 
the implant, I had a light period for more than a year, and I got tired of having to buy period products every few weeks. I re-membered reading about a Kickstarter for a compact menstrual cup, looked it up and found there are thousands of oth-er types of menstrual cups. You pop it in, clean it about twice a day and don’t worry about it. When your period is over, you 
boil the cup and put it away. I 
don’t think menstrual cups are any grosser than tampons or pads.
Menstrual cups range in price, 
but most are around $20 on Am-azon. Jezebel estimates women 
spend on average $61.11 on either tam-
pons or pads each year.
But women who switch to the cup can 
not only save money, but also the environ-ment. According to safecosmetics.org, a woman who uses tampons monthly will 
buy more than 11,000 in her lifetime.
It is estimated that approximately 20 
billion pads, tampons and applicators are 
being sent to North American landﬁ  lls an-nually, according to the Lunapads website, and these products require hundreds of years to biodegrade. While men-strual cups are made of silicone and aren’t biodegradable, they still reduce the amount of waste signiﬁ  cantly. There are also bio-
degradable tampons for those 
looking to help out the environ-ment.
While on my endless period, 
sometimes I felt like I needed a break from tampons, so I bought cloth pads. I love the customiza-
tion you can ﬁ  nd for cloth pads. You can ﬁ  nd cloth pads and pantiliners with prac-
tically any design. I’ve seen Disney prin-
cesses, Looney Tunes, tie-dye, smiley faces 
and clouds on cloth pads.
When you’re done using them, you just 
wash them, wring them out, put them to dry and then put them with your laundry. Although these might not be practical if you need a change up in the middle of the day, you can buy bags to put them in. Un-fortunately, to get cute customized ones, you can end up paying about $10 a pad on Etsy, but you can pay as little as $5 a pad, and you really only need them for as long as your period lasts. They also last longer than a year, same as a pair of underwear.
While it can get messy when you have 
a heavy period, it’s very similar to wearing a normal pad, but you have more control over the materials.
There are also period panties, which are 
about $40, and other eco-friendly, long-term alternatives to tampons and pads. 
While I switched for my endless period, I 
am never going back because I love to have 
control of my body.
Disclaimer: I totally understand if peo-
ple don’t want to or can’t use the cup. I’m 
just explaining an alternative that people 
might ﬁ  nd gross, but I encourage they try. 
I am also not endorsing any of the brands listed above speciﬁ  cally.

Menstrual cups are aﬀ  ordable, sustainable alternatives to pads, tamponsGuest Column
Britain has voted to leave the Europe-
an Union, and it is not good. British people should take this as an oppor-
tunity to reﬂ  ect on their decision.
Apparently, they have already 
begun doing so. More than one million peo-
ple who voted to leave now say they regret 
their decision, with many saying they voted 
the way they did under the assumption that their votes wouldn’t count. In other words, they had no real intent of leaving. “Urm, I think I kinda regret my vote,” tweeted one 
voter. “I had no real reason to pick what I 
did!”
There are plenty of real reasons to not 
have picked leave. Essentially, the vote 
was met with utter confusion and chaos. It 
seems like this catastrophic decision was as unprepared for as it was unexpected.
Supporters have noted these short-
term effects are expected with any ma-
jor change, and that markets are already bouncing back. True. But it is also 
true that a recent poll found that out of 600 economists, a stagger-
ing 88 percent believe the exit will 
hurt Britain’s growth prospects in the long run. “The odds of a global recession in 2017 just increased,” 
said Scott Sumner, an economist at 
George Mason University. A global recession at any time would be bad. A global recession during a historic migrant crisis would be really bad.
Ironically, this is precisely one of the 
reasons Britain voted to leave in the ﬁ  rst place — out of frustration toward immi-grants sparked by fear of extremism. While 
there may be some legitimacy to these feel-
ings, they seem to be prompted more by outright contempt for immigrants than by concern for national security. Just days af-ter the vote was announced, an online video 
showed teens spewing anti-immigrant slurs at a train passenger, who hap-
pened to be a veteran. “Don’t chat shit when you’re not even 
from England,” one teen yelled. 
“You’re a dirty little immigrant. Get back to Africa!” Far from being an isolated incident, this 
is a fairly accurate representa-
tion of the ways in which im-migrants are treated — both in the U.K. and elsewhere. There 
have been over 100 reported incidents of 
anti-immigrant harassment in Britain since 
the vote. Germany saw a 40 percent rise in right-wing attacks against foreigners this last year. 
Again, this is not to deny the legitimacy 
of foreign threats. 
Extremism is real, and it is dangerous. 
But no threat, whether from the Islamic State group or any other group, is enough 
to justify the demonization, stigmatization and mistreatment of entire groups of peo-
ple. “Is it really [xeno]phobia if you have something to be afraid of?” asked comedian 
Bill Maher. Yes, Bill, it is. Foreign threats 
have and always will exist — there is no way around this. But we shouldn’t use these threats as an excuse to generalize and 
discriminate.
Progress emerges when beliefs clash and 
new ideas spark. In this sense, multicul-
tural integration is a positive thing that en-courages development and innovation. By 
voting to leave the EU, the British people 
took a step away from inclusion and tol-erance and instead took a giant, reaction-ary leap toward nationalism. Hopefully, as 
Americans, we’ll learn from this and decide 
differently for ourselves come November.

A group of Alachua County 
women is helping a mother and her 
daughter build their dream house.
Since April 2, Alachua Women 
Build volunteers have helped Jessica 
Saylor and her daughter, Jemiriah 
Godbolt, construct their new home every Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. This will be the ninth house in Alach-
ua County built by the organization, 
according to its Facebook page.
Sarah Harrison, a volunteer, 
said the group comprises 15 female volunteers, two professionals, the homeowner and her daughter. She said the cost of construction — in-cluding materials and payment for the professionals — was $80,000.
Harrison said the organization 
hires professionals to do the electri-cal work, plumbing and roof work on the houses, while volunteers build and paint the interior and exterior.
Heidi Harris, the administrator of 
the Alachua Women Build’s Face-book page, said the land was do-nated by the city. She said the living space of the house is 1,200 square-feet, including three bedrooms and two bathrooms.
Harrison said the two main goals 
of the organization are to build hous-es for low-income families and em-power women.
“The idea is that you can do this, 
too,” she said. “You don’t have to de-pend on your boyfriend. People learn here.”
The organization, Harris said, has 
done all the fundraising and receives help from local sponsors. Lowe’s do-nates tools and construction supplies, Southern Charm Kitchen provides free lunches to the volunteers and the Gainesville Garden Club donates grass, trees and flowers for the yard.
Wells Fargo provides an interest-
free loan to homeowners, Harris said. 
She said homeowners have to 
make a certain amount of money, complete 200 hours of labor toward 
their houses and go through finan-
cial-management and homeowner-ship training before they receive loan approvals.
Saylor, a home health aide, said 
she had the option of choosing one of three different sites to build her house on, and that she could also make some modifications to the home.“I chose the paint color, the door 
color, a stained porch instead of painting it and then the landscape,” she said.
Saylor has to pay $1,000 in a 
down payment, but she has the chance to divide the payment into four payments of $250, Harris said.
Harris said Saylor liked the site be-
cause it is in a good part of town and close to her daughter’s high school.
“It’s really exciting to see these 
families go from living in, you know, usually substandard living to being a 
homeowner,” Harris said.

Gainesville’s gamers now have a 
new haven to gather and play in. 
Gamesville Tabletop, located at 
4401 NW 25th Place, closed its previ-
ous location at NW 16th Boulevard to support its growing business, owner Callie Williams said.
At its grand opening Saturday, 
customers were greeted by shelves of board games, including Scrabble, Mo-nopoly, Dead of Winter and Battlestar Galactica, along with plenty of card games, rule books and gaming mats. 
UF English senior Derek Delano said 
the updated location feels inviting. 
“The new store is very colorful and 
well organized, which really adds to the atmosphere they’ve built,” Delano said. 
The 21-year-old, who is a self-pro-
claimed regular, said he has visited the store almost every week since he dis-covered it last summer.
Saturday’s event included a scooter 
giveaway, gaming competitions and demos from game companies. 
Customers like Delano can use the 
store to connect with others through gaming, especially during the store’s nightly events, Williams said.
“You’re new to town, however, let’s 
say you play a game,” she said. “Well 
you show up to the store, find other 
people who play it and you’re able to 
relate to them on a certain level and 
make friends.”
Williams said that, along with other 
customers, about 10 college students visit the store on a daily basis.
“The best part is that you can find a 
community here,” she said.

Alachua County Sheriff’s Office dep-
uties arrested a Gainesville man early Sunday morning after police said he lied about being kidnapped.
At about 1:40 a.m., Craig Walker, 
44, texted his mother and said he was being held for ransom, according to the police report. 
The messages said Walker would be 
killed if a certain amount of money was 
not put in his mother’s mailbox, accord-
ing to the report. 
Detectives later found Walker, who 
told police two white men kidnapped him and took him from Gainesville to 
Lake City, Florida, where his arms were 
tied and a bag was placed over his head, according to the police report. 
Walker also told detectives the men 
had used his phone to contact his moth-
er and demand money, according to the 
report. 
He later told a detective he was never 
taken, nor were his arms tied, accord-ing to the report. Walker reportedly told 
authorities he sent the text messages in 
hopes of getting money and paying a drug-related debt. 
Deputies arrested Walker on charges 
of extortion and making a false report. 
Authorities took him to the Alachua 
County Jail where, as of press time, he 
remains in lieu of a $30,000 bond.

The Alligator Awards continue 
this week, with the second award 
being for “Best Freshman Athlete.” Sports writers Ray Boone, Matt Bran-non and Alejandro López join al-
ligatorSports editors Ian Cohen and 
Ethan Bauer in a roundtable discus-sion to debate the five nominees. De-bates will go in alphabetical order by the writer’s last name.
Bauer: Callaway’s explosive-
ness ignited dried-out receiving corps
There are all kinds of statistical 
reasons that justify Antonio Calla-way’s status as Florida’s best fresh-man athlete of 2015-16, but his rel-evance — unlike the other players on this list — goes beyond the box 
score. 
Still, let’s look at his numbers. 
Callaway led the Gators with 678 
receiving yards this season, tied for the team lead with four receiving touchdowns and averaged almost 20 yards per catch. 
Not even Florida’s last freshman 
phenom wideout, Percy Harvin, reached those numbers in 2006. 
For years, UF’s receiving corps 
had been lackluster. The once high-ly-recruited pass catchers have given Florida fans nothing to be excited about since Harvin’s departure in 2008. 
Enter Callaway. For the first time in seven years, the Gators had an actual playmaker on the outside. 
For the first time in seven years, 
the Gators had someone who was worthy of getting excited over when the ball landed in his hands.
And for the first time since Tim 
Tebow trotted out of the tunnel at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, Gator fans 
had some lasting, positive memories 
of the football season. 
Remember Callaway’s 63-yard 
catch-and-run to finish off Florida’s 13-point comeback against Tennes-see?
Of course you do. Who could for-
get it? It was the highlight of Flori-da’s season. 
And because Callaway single-Who was the best Florida  
freshman athlete of 2015-16?

Marquis Dendy wasn’t at his 
best.
But on Sunday, it didn’t mat-
ter.
The Florida track and field star 
jumped 8.42 meters in the men’s 
long jump on Sunday to qualify for the 2016 Olympics, where he’ll represent Team USA in Rio.
“It still wasn’t a good jump, as 
far as technicalities,” Dendy said 
in a release. 
Dendy, a reigning World In-
door Championships gold med-
alist, became just the third UF 
men’s long-jumper in program 
history to qualify for the event in the Olympics.
“Crazy, crazy competition. 
It was bananas,” Dendy said. “If you didn’t watch that, you 
missed out on something crazy.”
Meanwhile, current Florida 
track athletes KeAndre Bates, Ar-
man Hall and Najee Glass failed 
to qualify for the Olympics in 
their events on Sunday.Bates fin-
ished sixth in the men’s long jump (8.32 meters), and 
Hall and Glass 
placed  fourth 
(45.09 sec-onds) and sev-
enth (45.48) in the 400 meters, 
respectively. 
Hall and Glass still have an 
opportunity to be selected for the 4x400 relay pool, which will be announced on July 11.
“Watching Marquis and KeAn-
dre and Will (Claye) be a part of 
that was something special,” UF track and field coach Mike Hol-
loway said in a release. “The pas-
sion all of them put into it was amazing. It’s something that we’ll be talking about for a long 
time.”

Four former and current 
Florida swimmers are headed 
to the Olympic Games in Rio to represent the USA, but all of them left something to be de-sired in trials. 
On Saturday, the second 
to last day of the USA Olym-pic swimming trials, Elizabeth Beisel and Caeleb Dressel fell 
short of furthering their chances 
for medals. 
Beisel, who graduated from 
UF in 2014, had already made Rio by placing second in the women’s 400-meter individual medley but placed seventh in the 200-meter backstroke final. 
Beisel won silver in the 400-me-
ter IM at the 2012 Olympics and earned bronze in the 200-meter backstroke. 
Dressel, who will make his 
Olympic debut after placing second in the men’s 100-meter freestyle final, also fell short on Saturday, placing fourth in the 
50-meter freestyle final. He’s the only current UF swimmer to make the American team. 
The two remaining Gators 
headed to Rio for the USA — 
Ryan Lochte and Conor Dwyer — also didn’t advance in all 
their competitions, with Dwyer 
placing eighth in the 100-meter freestyle finals and Lochte plac-ing third in the 400-meter indi-
vidual medley, an event he won 
gold in at the 2012 Olympics. 
Still, Dwyer will compete in 
three events (400-meter free-style, 200-meter freestyle and 
the 4x200-meter freestyle re-
lay) while Lochte, the 11-time Olympian, will compete in two (200-meter individual medley, 
4x200-meter freestyle relay). 
In addition to the Gator 
swimmers representing the US, 
eight other former or current Gators will head to Rio to rep-
resent other countries, accord-
ing to FloridaGators.com. They are Mitch D’Arrigo (Italy), Hilda Luthersdottir (Iceland), Corey 
Main (New Zealand), Sebastien 
Rousseau (South Africa), Edu-ardo Solaeche-Gomez (Spain), Jan Switkowski (Poland), Dan Wallace (Great Britain) and 
Pawel Werner (Poland).

the Southeastern Conference Championship Game in Atlanta.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LONDON (AP) — It was raining, 
ever so slightly, and her Wimbledon 
fourth-round match was slipping away, 
ever so slightly, when Serena Williams 
stumbled as she ran to the net, wind -
ing up seated on the slick Centre Court 
grass.
Her opponent, two-time major 
champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, sent 
a shot flying past Williams to go up a 
break at 5-4 in the opening set.
Williams was slow to get up. She 
wasn’t injured, but was worried she 
could be. Why, she demanded to know from chair umpire Marija Cicak, wasn’t the retractable roof shut? Eventually, 
after one more game and much discus
-
sion, action was delayed for nearly 30 minutes while the cover was closed.
Whether it was the transforma
-
tion to an indoor court, the strategy session the break allowed her to have 
with coach Patrick Mouratoglou or, as 
Williams suggested, simply the chance 
to calm down, she completely domi
-
nated the rest of the way, taking the 
last nine games to beat the 13th-seeded 
Kuznetsova 7-5, 6-0 on Monday.
“I’m so intense on the court. I give 
200 percent every time I’m out there. Every single point. Sometimes I just 
need to take a deep breath and relax. 
I just needed to do that. I can do that 
on the timeouts,” said Williams, who 
is seeking her seventh Wimbledon title 
and 22nd Grand Slam trophy overall.
She wound up winning 24 of the 
match’s last 29 points, and her 14 
aces helped produce a “Did I read that 
right?” edge of 43-8 in winners.
The 13th-seeded Kuznetsova said 
she knew closing the roof would help Williams, but agreed it was the right 
decision, given how wet the grass was, 
saying: “I was afraid. ... I’m not ready 
to risk (an) injury.”Williams moved into her 12th quar
-
terfinal at the All England Club, and 
she’ll be joined by her older sister Ve -
nus at that stage of the tournament for the first time since 2010.
In the women’s quarterfinals, Ve

tasia Pavlyuchenkova. Tuesday’s other matchups: No. 4 Angelique Kerber 
vs. No. 5 Simona Halep, and No. 19

Cibulkova’s story is fascinating. She

GATORS IN MLB
Staff Report
In his ﬁ  rst game of the season, Mike 
Zunino homered twice.
Seattle sent the former Florida catcher 
to Triple-A Tacoma last August in hopes of 
taking pressure off the former ﬁ  rst-round pick and giving him time to ﬁ  nd a rhythm at the plate.
Before he was demoted, Zunino had 
batted .174 in his last 112 games.
His time in the minors brought him out 
of his funk.
After the Mariners’ backup catcher 
Steve Clevenger suffered a hand injury last week, Seattle called up Zunino, who went 2-for-4 with two home runs in the Mari-ners’ 12-6 win over Baltimore on Saturday.
“It’s not easy to go back to the minor 
leagues and work on things and have a good attitude about it,” Seattle manager Scott Servais told the Associated Press af-ter the Mariners’ win. “Happy for him and a big night no doubt. Wasn’t expecting two home runs but we’ll take it.”
One former Gator struggling, another 
surging in Astros minor league system:
Even when he was playing for Florida, 
Nolan Fontana never had a problem reach-ing base. It was one of the main reasons the Houston Astros took him with the 61st pick in the 2012 MLB Draft.
Fontana, who has never made it to the 
majors, has a career on-base percentage of .388 in the Astros’ minor league system. That, along with solid defense, has earned him a spot on Houston’s 40-man roster. 
This season, though, his on-base per-
centage plummeted by over .100 points to .269 while playing for the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies. 
Meanwhile, his one-time UF teammate 
and Fresno outﬁ  elder Preston Tucker has played well in Triple-A since being sent down from the majors on May 16. 
Tucker is hitting .296 with seven home 
runs and 22 RBIs in 39 games, accentuated by a three-home run, ﬁ  ve-hit and eight-RBI performance against the Salt Lake Bees on June 30. 
Several Florida draft picks ink deals:Multiple Florida baseball players have 
signed deals with the teams who selected them in the 2016 MLB Draft including Peter Alonso, who agreed to a $909,200 contract with the New York Mets last Wednesday, according to MLB.com’s Jim Callis. 
A.J. Puk, the No. 6 overall pick in the 
draft, also signed his rookie deal. Accord-ing to multiple reports, the former Florida pitcher signed a contract worth $4,096,200 last Thursday.
Florida’s other ﬁ  rst-round selection, 
Dane Dunning, signed a deal with the Washington Nationals worth $2,000,000.
Outﬁ  elder Buddy Reed agreed to a  
$1,075,000 deal with San Diego. 
One pick before him at No. 47, the Ath-letics selected Florida pitcher Logan Shore. The A’s inked him to a $1,500,000 deal. 
Rounding out the Gators selected in 
the top 100 overall picks, Shaun Anderson was taken 88th by the Cincinnati Reds and signed for $700,000. 
All contract ﬁ  gures were taken from 
MLB.com’s “2016 Draft: Signing and Bonus Tracker.”

fan base a reason to care, he’s the Florida freshman most deserving of recognition. 
Boone: Horsﬁ  eld’s talent im-
possible to overlook 
The University of Florida’s men’s 
golf program has been graced with spectacular talent over the years. From Camilo Villegas to Billy Horschel, the Gators have consis-
tently produced quality players. 
And Sam Horsﬁ  eld might be the 
best of them all. 
Horsﬁ  eld came to Florida as 
somewhat of an unknown — that is, 
until he teed it up in the 2015 U.S. Open as an 18-year-old fresh out of high school. 
When he got to UF, it didn’t take 
long for him to make his mark. Hors-ﬁ  eld claimed his ﬁ  rst victory at the Sea Best Invitational on Feb. 2, and it didn’t stop there. He went on to win two more times, capturing the Southern Highlands Collegiate and the Mason Rudolph Championship. 
Since 1977, only ﬁ  ve UF players 
have won at least three events in a 
season. With his win at the Mason 
Rudolph, Horsﬁ  eld became the sixth to join that exclusive club, and he is the only one to do so as a freshman.
In addition, Horsﬁ  eld’s 70.55 
scoring average broke Villegas’ re-cord for lowest single-season stroke average. His stellar season earned him just about every accolade in the book. Horsﬁ  eld was named the 
Southeastern Conference Freshman 
of the Year and a PING First-Team All-American. In addition to being a semiﬁ  nalist for both the Jack Nick-laus and Ben Hogan awards, Hors-ﬁ  eld also earned First Team All-SEC and SEC All-Freshman Team honors. 
Horsﬁ  eld’s talent is undeniable. 
Not only is he Florida’s best fresh-
man athlete, but he might be its best 
athlete, period. 
Brannon: Barnhill’s track re-
cord makes her most deserving 
There are three reasons Kelly 
Barnhill was the Gators’ greatest freshman in 2016. 
The ﬁ  rst was her un-freshman-
like competitive maturity. In her ﬁ  rst 
collegiate appearance, the pitcher 
from Marietta, Georgia, started against No. 2 Michigan, the team Florida had narrowly beaten in the championship of the Women’s Col-lege World Series only eight months prior. 
Barnhill tossed a complete-game 
shutout in her debut, giving up just 
three hits to the World Series runner-
ups. The veteran conﬁ  dence and poise she displayed led her to a dom-inant 15-1 record. That’s strike one. 
The second reason is her op-
ponents’ batting average. If it’s the pitcher’s job to keep the other team off base, then Barnhill is your perfect candidate. Opposing teams hit just .140 
against the right-handed hurler, shattering a 2004 record for the low-
est opposing batting average in UF 
softball history. So statistically, Barn-hill’s freshman season was the most unhittable stretch of pitching deliv-ered by any Gator. 
That’s strike two. The third reason is her sheer 
number of strikeouts. Barnhill struck out 167 batters in 108.1 innings. 
That means in an average seven-
inning game, she sits down 10.8 bat-ters on strikes. 
No Gator had ever eclipsed 10, 
and Barnhill ﬁ  nished second in the nation in the category. Pop Quiz: Who holds the UF record for most strikeouts in a single game? That’s right, Barnhill rewrote the record 
one month after her ﬁ  rst college start 
by mowing down a school-record high tying 18 Winthrop Eagles.
That’s strike three.Cohen: Allen’s instant offense 
key for UF basketball
During a year full of positive signs 
for a rebuilding Florida basketball team — the introduction of a new, 
young coach, a 21-win campaign 
and an SEC Tournament quarterﬁ  nal appearance — the best sign for UF was the emergence of KeVaughn Al-len.
The freshman provided an offen-
sive spark to a UF team that ranked 10th in the SEC in points per game. Allen averaged 11.6 points and shot 39.9 percent from the ﬁ  eld in a start-ing role last season, earning a spot on the 2016 SEC All-Freshman Team.
And it all started with a breakout 
performance against FSU in Decem-ber.
Allen scored a season-high 32 
points, the ﬁ  fth-most by a Florida freshman in program history. He ﬁ  nished his ﬁ  rst collegiate campaign with the fourth-most points by a UF freshman over the last two decades, 
consistently providing baskets for a 
Florida team that struggled to score down the stretch and in the postsea-son.
He was the only UF player who 
could bring the Gators back from a deep deﬁ  cit by heating up and down-ing a couple quick three-pointers. Then-redshirt senior Dorian Finney-
Smith even nicknamed him “The 
Microwave.”
Heading into next year, Allen 
will be the offensive centerpiece for the Gators, who will try to make the NCAA Tournament for the ﬁ  rst time since 2014.
Give The Microwave some well-
deserved recognition.
López: Boren proves herself as 
a top-10 gymnast
Say what you want, but one thing 
is certain: Gymnastics is hard. 
And yet, as a freshman, Alicia 
Boren managed to make it look easy. 
Part of a ﬁ  ve-woman recruiting 
class that included a former U.S. Senior National Team member and three other Junior Olympic competi-tors, Boren stitched together an ex-emplary 2016 campaign. 
For starters, the Franklin Lakes, 
New Jersey, native consistently con-tributed as an all-around athlete. Boren competed in the classiﬁ  cation in 13 out of 14 meets — only Gator-great Bridget Sloan appeared in as many all-around contests this season — clinching podium honors in seven of them. 
Combined, Florida’s remaining 
freshman quartet placed three times across all events. 
Additionally, her performances 
garnered four SEC Freshman of the Week awards. No other ﬁ  rst-year Florida gymnast managed to match that ﬁ  gure. 
What’s more? Her dominance ex-
tended to the national stage.
According to Road to Nation-
als’ all-around rankings, Boren was one of three freshmen to crack the top 10, ﬁ  nishing 0.070 RQS points behind Stanford’s Elizabeth Price for the ﬁ  rst-year crown. She also es-tablished herself as a premier vault competitor, ﬁ  nishing third among 
freshmen and ninth nationally.
She rapidly emerged as a force — 
you’d be hard-pressed to deny that. 
In all, Boren proved herself to be 
an important cog in the Gators gym-
nastics program for years to come.
