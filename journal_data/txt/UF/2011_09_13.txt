  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day 
O’Connor may be retired, but she made it known that even though she’s no longer writ-ing opinions, she’s still got them. 
  During her two speeches at UF on Mon-
day, O’Connor addressed the American pub-lic’s ignorance regarding judiciary and civics education.
  O’Connor said two-thirds of Americans 
can’t name the three branches of government and less than half of Americans can name a Supreme Court justice.
  O’Connor’s ﬁ  rst speech took place at the 
Phillips Center for Performing Arts and dis-cussed judiciary reform, and her second speech, which discussed civic education, took place at University Auditorium.
  “I think the biggest challenge we face today 
in our judicial government is the lack of un-derstanding of the public of the role of courts in our country,” O’Connor said at the Phillips Center.
  For her ﬁ  rst appearance, O’Connor spoke 
in front of a full house at the Phillips Center, 
where she discussed judiciary reform. 
  O’Connor’s second appearance took place 
at  University Auditorium, where she spoke in front of another full room of about 860 people. Her second appearance, during which she dis-cussed civics education, originally was sup-posed to be held in the Pugh Hall auditorium. However, due to overcrowding, organizers had to move the event to the auditorium, said Ann Henderson, director of the Bob Graham Center for Public Service.

 Florida sophomore linebacker 
Dee Finley was arrested Monday 
afternoon on charges of driving with a suspended license and re-sisting a University Police ofﬁ  cer with violence. The latter is a third-degree felony.
  Ofﬁ  cer William Sasser pulled 
Finley over at 1:49 p.m. after Fin-ley drove his scooter around a barricade on Stadium Road. Sass-er asked for his license and regis-tration, but Finley told the ofﬁ  cer 
he was late and did not want to give him the information, ac-cording to the arrest report.
  When Sasser 
told Finley he could not leave, 
Finley started his scooter and tried to take off, but Sasser grabbed his left wrist. Finley then snatched his hand away and “squared” to Sasser while still straddling his scooter, according to the report.
  Sasser proceeded to pull out 
his department-issued Taser and told Finley to put his hands be-hind his back. Finley obliged. 
“Coach [Will] Muschamp is 
aware of the incident and will handle the matter,” a UF spokes-man said through text message Monday night. 
  Finley’s license is suspended in 
Alabama and Florida for multiple offenses and a failure to appear in court, according to the report. He  LB Finley

The Pride of the Sunshine may be hitting the 
streets of dreary London next year   .
The Fightin’ Gator Marching Band has been 
invited to play at the 2012 Olympics.
  John M. Watkins Jr., director of the march-
ing band, received the invitation by phone Friday from the organizing committee for the 
London Olympic Games.
  In April, the marching band received a letter 
asking if it would be interested in performing at the Olympics. 
  The band answered yes and submitted a 
portfolio that included the band’s history, biog-raphies, videotapes and CDs.
  “It is a huge honor to be picked to represent the United States at the Olympics in London,” said Watkins, who has worked with the band for six years.
  It is unknown which, if any, other univer-
sities have been chosen. No details have been planned for the trip. 
  “I think everybody’s really excited,” Wat-
kins said, “but it’s very preliminary at this point.”
  This isn’t the Gator marching band’s ﬁ  rst 
international invitation. Marching band headed to 2012 Olympics

� STUDENTS WILL NOW PAY $15 TO 
HAVE LABORATORY WORK DONE ON CAMPUS.
KELSEY DEAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF’s Student Health Care Center recent-
ly introduced a new fee to take effect this 
semester. 
The facility now charges a $15 handling 
fee for all tests processed by the center’s laboratory.  
Handling was previously done for free.The new charge allows all students to 
have their lab work completed on campus, regardless of their insurance provider. 
“Before the fee, a student might have 
to travel from location to location depend-ing on what their insurance would cover,” health center spokeswoman Catherine See-man said. 
“It’s about convenience and comfort,” 
she said. “By charging, we can continue to provide continuity of care.”
While the costs of the actual tests vary, 
students will now pay what their insurance policy dictates, in addition to the $15.
Although most infirmary charges are re-
lated to insurance, the new cost comes di-rectly from the Student Health Care Center. The staff time used for handling and 
processing lab materials will be compen-sated using the money collected by the new charge. 
Because the fee affects UF students di-
rectly, the change is causing debate among students. 
“The fee wouldn’t affect whether or not 
I get immediate health attention. It’s not unreasonable,” freshman Zachary Glatzer said.
However, senior Michael Pipitone, 21, 
disagrees. 
“I used to go to the infirmary a lot, most-
ly out of convenience, because I knew it was covered,” he said. “Now, I don’t have a problem with getting into my car and find-ing a cheaper health center. I would rather go to an off-campus health center where my insurance covers everything.”
Additional information regarding the 
new costs can be found on the UF Student Health Care Center website or by email at insurance@shcc.ufl.edu.Health care center charges new feeaLUMNI

Former professional football play-
er and UF alumnus Emmitt Smith is 
returning to Gainesville Saturday for a signing of his new book “Game On: Find Your Purpose — Pursue Your Dream.”
The signing will take place at the 
UF Bookstore from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Smith, who retired from the sport 
in 2005, played for UF for three sea-sons between 1987 and 1989. During that time, he broke 58 school records and was a first-team All-SEC selection  all three years.
After his time with the Gators, 
Smith played in the NFL for 15 sea-sons — 13 of those with the Dallas Cowboys. During his NFL career, Smith won three Super Bowl champi-onships and was named to eight Pro Bowl teams.
In his book, Smith discusses the 
importance of perseverance, cour -
age and faith while overcoming ob-stacles.
Pre-pharmacy freshman and Smith 
fan Alex Valdes plans to pick up a copy of the book and bring it to the signing.
“Emmitt Smith is the epitome 
of The Gator Nation philosophy,” Valdes said. 
A Dallas Cowboys fan, accounting 
junior Ashley Quintal has been fol-lowing Smith and the Cowboys since she was a little girl.
“As I was growing up, Emmitt 
Smith and the Cowboys were a staple 
part of Sundays in my household,” she 
said. “I will always remember my father walking around the house wearing his Smith gear as we cheered on the Cow-boys.”
To get books 
signed by Smith, fans must pick up tickets at the UF Bookstore before the event, according to a press release. Tickets will be given to customers who purchase the book from the UF Bookstore and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.  
For more information, call 352-392-0194. Emmitt Smith to hold

Twenty-three people were 
ejected from Ben Hill Griffin Sta-
dium on Saturday for standing on the bleachers during the foot-ball game against the University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
That’s 17 more than the six 
ejections at the Florida Atlantic University game a week earlier, said Lt. Mitchal Welsh of the Uni-versity Police. 
UF junior Eric Crihfield had 
seen only the first few plays of the UF-UAB game when he and four other people were kicked out.
An Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office deputy told them an ush-er had previously warned them about standing on the bleachers and they were now being ejected for continuing to do so.
Crihfield said an usher never 
approached them, and they asked to speak with the employee who had supposedly spoken to them. 
The deputy refused to allow 
them to speak with the usher but said he had seen the employee walking up and down the aisles, telling people to step off the bleachers, said Crihfield, who was sitting near the aisle at the game. 
“We were completely baffled,” 
he said.
Welsh said people are asked not to stand on bleachers for safe-ty reasons.
The increase in ejections at the 
UAB game may have been be-cause officials handle the bleach-er issue on a complaint basis, Welsh said, and there were more complaints on Saturday.Ushers may not always be 
available to warn people not to stand on bleachers, like when they check tickets at the begin-ning of a game. Officers will usu-ally handle the issue themselves in those cases. 
People who are ejected from 
the game are first taken to the booking room set up in the sta-dium, which Welsh runs, where they provide their basic informa-tion. UF students may be provid-ed with paperwork if they need to attend a hearing with the Stu-dent Conduct and Conflict Reso-lution department of the Dean of Students Office. 
Students are not required to 
attend conduct hearings and are not barred from attending other football games if they are ejected for standing on the bleachers, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said.
People don’t always receive 
face-to-face warnings, but an-nouncements are made during football games telling people not to stand on the bleachers, Welsh said. 
“I find it hard to believe that 
somebody would not know that you’re not allowed to stand on the bleachers at this point,” he said. 4, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2011

The University of Central Florida’s Greek 
Council has placed an indefinite ban on alco-
hol at all events registered through Fraternity and Sorority Life.
The decision follows the death of a UCF 
student on Aug. 25.
Although the cause of UCF freshman Ann 
Hefferin’s death is still unknown, a 911 call released by UCF police confirms that Heffer -
in, 18, had been drinking before she died. 
UCF spokesman Grant Heston said an 
unauthorized party at Sigma Chi frater -
nity house on UCF’s campus served alco-hol, which goes against university policy.  UCF Interfraternity Council president 
Adam Brock said, “This was just to re-evalu-ate the way we are hosting our social events and ensure all of us are following national and university policies.”
Brock wrote in an email that UCF’s Greek 
Council, which presides over all 45 fraterni-ties and sororities at the university, voted on the ban Sept 2. Events approved before Sept. 2 will not be affected by the ban.
The ban will be lifted when the Greek 
community forms a plan for hosting events that is consistent with national and university rules, he said. 
Jack Causseaux, associate director of So-
rority and Fraternity Affairs at UF, said to his knowledge there has never been such a wide-spread ban at UF.Under the Office of Sorority and Frater -
nity Affairs’ event guidelines, no alcohol may be served at any recruitment, intake or new-member events. If alcohol is to be served at 
an event on campus or in a chapter house, the event must be approved by the office at least 10 business days in advance.
Wristbands are dis-
tributed to attendees who 
are over 21, and addi-tional guidelines dictate how much alcohol can be 
brought to the event.
Some chapter houses are dry because na-
tional guidelines dictate it. This is true for most of the sorority houses and a few frater -
nity houses at UF, Causseaux said.
Of course, sometimes sororities and frater -
nities break the rules, “just like with any other student. They’re not exempt from what nor -
mal college students do,” Causseaux said.
For the 64 fraternities and sororities at 
UF, there is a Greek Conduct Committee that holds hearings for violations and recom-mends sanctions to the dean of students, if necessary. 
It is possible for a fraternity or sorority, as 
well as any other student organization, to be suspended for violating rules about alcohol. 
Rajiv Asnani, president of UF’s Interfra-
ternity Council, said he couldn’t comment on UCF’s broad ban on drinking because the university’s Greek community is different from UF’s. 
He said IFC is quick to handle violations, 
but at least since he can remember the council has never considered suspending or banning all fraternities for a single incident.
“I don’t see it happening in my term as 
president,” Asnani said. 
UCF bans alcohol at greek events; similar move unlikely at UF
� SOME PROMISED 
PRAYERS.

Despite the 90-plus degree heat, 
the unrelenting sun and the hectic 
rush of traffic on Monday, students stopped for a moment on Turling-ton Plaza to record and commit to good deeds honoring the victims of 9/11.
Ten years and one day after 
the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, members of the Lubavitch-Chabad Jewish Student & Community Center held the 9/11 Good Deed Marathon to encourage students to perform a random act of kindness in memory of the attacks.
Members held a moment of si-
lence at 12:54 p.m. 
Students, faculty and staff 
wrote their deeds on a slip of pa-per, attached the picture to a vic-tim of the attacks and pinned them to illustrations of the World Trade Center towers on a board. 
One person promised to help 
her roommate cope with a family death, and another decided to lis-ten to students more.
“I’m going to call my brother 
in Afghanistan tonight,” read an-other slip.
Others promised prayers.Rabbi Berl Goldman, executive 
director of Lubavitch-Chabad, said the student group has been honor -
ing the victims of Sept. 11 this way since 2005. He described it as coun-tering the random act of violence with random acts of kindness.
“We’re doing the opposite,” he 
said. 
Goldman and members of 
Lubavitch-Chabad stood at their table from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Last year, they collected about 
800 good deeds, or “mitzvahs.” This year, the students’ goal was to reach more than 1,000. The at-tendance tally came out to 1,035.
Goldman said people of all re-
ligions and backgrounds stopped by the table.
Some students stopped by of 
their own accord, and group mem-bers encouraged people walking on Turlington Plaza to stop by. 
Participants received a sticker 
advertising the event after they had pinned their deeds to the board.
One student stopped at the ta-
ble to read the names of the Sept. 11 victims, which were printed into the red stripes on an Ameri-can flag displayed on the table.
International studies junior 
Jared Winn stopped by when he was walking through Turlington Plaza. He wanted to do something to 
commemorate the victims.
“I just remember that day very 
vividly,” he said. Winn remem-bered watching the second plane fly into the southern tower live on television. 
He was 11 at the time.He said he realized it was se-
rious when the plane hit, and his mom started crying. 
Winn’s uncle worked in the 
Pentagon, but had not gone in to work that day.
After a little difficulty getting 
his pin to stick in the board, Winn added his slip of paper to the oth-ers.
He will call his mom to honor 
the victims of Sept. 11, 2001.

The newly created Engineering In-
novation Institute at UF has selected 
its inaugural director. 
Erik Sander is the new director of 
the institute, which is dedicated to building entrepreneurial culture and developing innovation skills in the next generation of engineers. 
“We’re a nexus of engineering en-
trepreneurship in the college that fo-cuses on faculty , staff and students,” Sander said. 
Sander graduated from UF in 1984 
with a bachelor’s degree in mechani-cal engineering. 
He also worked 10 years in the 
aerospace industry and at companies including General Electric and Lock-heed Martin. He returned to UF in 1995 and later became the director of industry programs in the College of Engineering.Through the institute, students can 
take courses on engineering innova-tion, entrepreneurship, leadership, ethics and communication, Sander said. 
Freshmen can take an introduction 
module on engineering leadership and innovation, but the majority of the courses offered through the insti-tute are available only to seniors and graduate students. 
Sander said he hopes the institute 
will start offering courses to juniors and sophomores in the future.
The institute will host its first event, 
the Innovation Summit, on Friday. The event will include leaders who impact engineering from academia, industry and the government. 
Notable speakers and panelists at-
tending include Chris Malachowsky , co-founder of NVIDIA, and Thomas Peterson, assistant director of the Na-
tional Science Foundation.Institute selects director

When Samuel Mirtil turned in his UF housing contract 
at Preview, he expected to spend the next 10 months shar -
ing a room with someone he barely knew and a bathroom 
with eight other guys.
Instead, the chemistry freshman was told that there 
was no more on-campus housing available and he would be put on a waiting list for the spring semester, but he would have to look off campus.
Mirtil is not alone in his housing frustration. This year, 
UF received 14,466 applications for on-campus housing. There are currently 7,744 students living on campus.
The disparity between these numbers has caused the UF housing department to turn to some unconventional measures.
About 100 resident assistants were given temporary 
roommates, and 64 students have been placed in overflow housing off campus — situations that have yet to be fully resolved five weeks into the semester.
Each year, UF Housing offers more room contracts 
than there are rooms available to ensure that residence halls are as full as possible.
“We typically open every fall semester with an average 
occupancy of 102 to 103 percent,” said Sharon Blansett, as-sistant to the associate vice president for student affairs. 
Usually, she said, students without rooms are placed 
in temporary late-applicant triples or in overflow hous-ing. Overflow spaces include apartments or other rooms not traditionally used for housing.
This year, the overflow housing arrangements may last 
through the spring semester as the housing department struggles to first find open rooms for the resident assis-tants’ roommates.
“We’re working to move these students into a different 
permanent housing arrangement,” Blansett said. “They’re our first priority to take any available space.”
As resident assistants typically have their rooms to 
themselves, Blansett said the housing department asked for volunteers who would be willing to share a room.
The other students have been placed in Oakbrook 
Walk, an apartment complex on Southwest 13th Street, south of Archer Road.
Mirtil said he was shocked when he heard he would 
not be able to live on campus.
“I feel like I’m missing out on the freshman experi-
ence,” he said.With dorms full, resident assistants forced to take roommates

“Don’t abuse the 
Taser, bro!”
Most people in the UF community are surely familiar 
with the phrase “Don’t Tase me, bro!” 
If you aren’t, the phrase dates back to 2007 when 
police shot a student protester with a Taser gun during a speech on UF’s campus by Sen. John Kerry . 
Whether this student warranted this engagement is a debate 
for another time. 
However, the use of a Taser by police in the following sce-
nario out of Marin County , Calif. was not only wrong but also bizarre.
On June 30, 2009, Peter McFarland’s wife called 911 after he 
fell and hurt himself. But when the paramedics arrived, 66-year-old McFarland refused to go to the hospital and declined medi-cal assistance. 
The events that followed landed Marin County in court over 
a lawsuit filed by McFarland. 
According to the suit, officers arrived at the home “without 
consent and without a warrant.” However, police are often au-tomatically dispatched during medical emergencies.  
After McFarland made a comment about wanting to kill 
himself — a joke about how embarrassed he was for falling, ac-cording to McFarland’s attorneys — the police became adamant about taking McFarland to the hospital. 
McFarland then told the deputies to leave. This caused one 
of the officers to pull out his Taser, demanding McFarland come with him to the hospital.
When McFarland rose from his sofa, the deputy proceeded 
to shock him several times. 
Obviously, a red flag pops up for every law enforcement of-
ficer when one begins talking or even joking about suicide. It is probably part of police protocol to ask the person to come in for medical or psychological assistance. 
However, elderly people tend to be very proud and become 
quite embarrassed by things like falling or losing particular mo-tor functions. Anyone with grandparents can attest to this. 
In this scenario, the deputy should have used common sense 
and judged the situation on a more individual basis. 
If McFarland did not want to go to the hospital, it should 
have been his choice. What business is it of Marin County offi-cials whether McFarland gets treated for any injuries sustained from his fall? 
Not only is this a problem, given the fact that McFarland was 
in his 60s and had just fallen, but why also did the deputy feel it was necessary to shock him with a Taser? 
The issue in this case is not only police brutality but also 
the line at which the state stops trying to protect us from our -
selves. 
McFarland clearly was not hurting anyone and probably was 
not seriously injured from his fall. When the deputies arrived on the scene and were told to leave, they should have left. 
The story does not mention if his wife was worried over her 
husband’s joking remarks about suicide. 
Luckily, McFarland won a $1.9 million settlement with the 
county to make up for it.Responsible drivers make the best friends
I’ve learned a few things in my 20 years.
My friends know that I have the mentality of an 
old lady. Give me a pair of slippers and a season of 
“Parks and Recreation” over going clubbing any night of the week.
So, I’d just like to give you this pearl of wisdom: 
When it comes to friends, you can never have too many.
I’m not talking about your number of Facebook 
friends or how many followers you have on Twitter (but feel free to add me on both of those sites). You just never know when you’ll need someone to joke around with or someone to whom you can vent out your frustrations.
Let’s see if we can be BFFs, readers. Here is a quiz 
about common pedestrian challenges we all face on cam-pus. It’s just a quick, super painless quiz. Here we go!
Question 1: On the UF campus, where do you feel 
bikes belong?
Answer: In the bike lane How many times have I been casually, or briskly, 
walking to class when all of a sudden a biker rushes by me on the sidewalk? It doesn’t matter if they toot their little bike horn or yell something.  There are specific lanes made especially for bikes. Can you please, please, please use them?
Question 2: When is an appropriate time to text?Answer: Not in your car If you are driving a car, a phone better not be in your 
hand. This is a predominantly pedestrian campus, in case you haven’t noticed. That means when students are walking around, they expect the people in cars to act responsibly. Your license means that you have been trusted to drive safely. Be alert, and pay attention to your surroundings. You can’t do that if you’re too busy exercising your thumbs.
Question 3: Do you own the sidewalk?Answer: No. Walking with friends can be great. Try not to walk 
three-wide; if it is a busy sidewalk or if you see other people walking toward you, it’s time to condense into a single-file line. No one died and made you ruler of the walkway, so suck up your pride and scoot over. Sometimes, people don’t move in time. If that happens, and elbows get bumped, do apologize.
Question 4: Can you share 
the road?
Answer: Yes. Pedestrians might have to 
trust drivers an awful lot, but 
drivers have to be able to trust us, too. Don’t dart willy-nilly into traffic; that’s how accidents are caused. At the same time, don’t charge at a busy crosswalk. You can clearly see if there’s a lot of people, so there’s no need to bum rush them with your car.
Question 5: Are people on scooters a lot cooler than 
the rest of us?
Answer: Nope, they are not. Scooters are pretty cute and zippy, don’t get me 
wrong. But just because you can pull out really noisily in front of me on the road doesn’t mean you should. There are a lot of different modes of transportation around these parts, so just be wary of all of them.
There. That wasn’t so bad, right? How did you 
score?
These are just a few of my pet peeves when I’m out 
and about on campus. The best friendships are born out of similar tastes. I enjoy yelling about things that make me happy and things that make me mad. It’s pretty fun and rewarding to find people who will yell with you.
In all seriousness, pedestrian safety is something that 
needs to be addressed on this campus. With so many people constantly around, it’s important that we all do our best to be aware of one another. 
Take an extra second to look before you cross the 
street. Smile and say sorry if you run into someone. Try giving the right-of-way instead of just taking it. 
We could all use a lesson in transportation courtesy.Sami Main is a journalism junior at UF. Her column ap-

If paying for tuition, fees, rent, textbooks, food and per-
sonal expenses wasn’t enough, I’d like to add another task to the typical college student’s challenges: studying 
abroad. 
It’s not the most popular bullet on a financially chal-
lenged student’s things-to-do list, but it is a truly enriching opportunity that should be experienced.
This past summer, I studied in New Zealand with Dr. 
Mark Hostetler. Unfortunately, the options at UF are very limited when it comes to engineering programs abroad. 
Regardless, I was determined to experience life outside of 
the United States and decided on a program that interested me. It didn’t matter whether it contributed to my degree or not. 
The program, “New Zealand Biodiversity and Conserva-
tion,” was completely unrelated to my mechanical engineer-ing major. 
The six-week period I spent on the other side of the planet 
was one of the most memorable times of my life.
The beautiful mountains, forests, plains, farms and 
beaches of New Zealand’s south island were my classrooms, and nature hikes were a primary component of the learning experience. 
Nothing here at UF has ever com-
pared to the learning experience I had abroad. 
This subject of study, which I had 
only a vague idea about when I applied, turned out to be an extremely important and interesting subject that had never even manifested itself as a conscious thought in my mind prior to this experience. 
The combination of this new way of learning about such 
an alien topic of study and soaking up this new culture and lifestyle was an invaluable adventure.
Honestly, it helped open my eyes to the whole world. I realized there is more to life than just being born, grow-
ing old and dying in the United States. 
It made me hungry for more. I now want to intern abroad, and I want to get my mas-
ter’s degree abroad. 
I may want to call a new country my home in the future. The bubble of the American lifestyle I’d been raised in my 
entire life had been popped, and an incredibly vast number of options and opportunities were revealed.Now the hard part: money. I know firsthand how terrifying the thought of gathering 
up thousands of dollars over a long period of time can be. 
It’s especially terrifying knowing you’re just going to 
spend it all in as little as six weeks. 
I was prepared to use the money I had saved from work-
ing and possibly to take out my first loan(s) to ensure I would not miss out on this opportunity. 
But, as it turned out, I was extremely fortunate in this 
department. 
I was awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman International 
Scholarship, giving me enough to cover all of the tuition and housing fees for my program. 
It was an enormous burden lifted off my shoulders. It is also not impossible for you. Hunting down scholarships and grants to come up with 
the money to study abroad is completely worthwhile. 
I hope my fellow Gators will be inspired to take advan-
tage of the wonderful opportunities we have at UF to study abroad and that the Gilman scholarship will come to the aid of many other Gators as well.

Speaking Out
America’s national anthem ends 
with the phrase: “O’er the land of the free and the home of the 
brave.” Does the land of the free also have to be the land of the unemployed?
Over the past few years, our nation 
has been struggling to recover from a re-cession marked by high unemployment. 
In 2009, President Obama responded 
to this situation by issuing a gigantic stimulus package worth $787 billion. 
While it may have averted a deeper re-
cession, it did not correct our trajectory.
Last week’s report from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics confirms that our country is in crisis with our unemployment rate stuck at 9.1 percent. 
More importantly, American citizens 
and families are in crisis. 
In 2009, President Obama promised a 
reduction to an 8 percent unemployment rate. Clearly, we are on the wrong path. 
President Obama now suggests mu-
nicipal construction projects as a solu-tion. 
At best, this will create temporary 
jobs but will not fix the issue in the long term.
President Obama, we call upon you 
to give American entrepreneurs (that is, those who create jobs) and businesses the tools they need to create jobs.
First, fund and sponsor relevant re-
search in such a way that the resultant intellectual property is released into the public domain, particularly focusing on new, rapidly growing areas such as re-generative med-icine, cloud technology and healthcare. 
S e c o n d , 
identify and publicly praise entrepre-neurs and companies that start new busi-nesses and create substantial numbers of jobs. 
Third, make it easier for businesses, 
small and large, to continually take the risks demanded by a rapidly changing marketplace to create and sustain jobs for tomorrow.
Fourth, make capital available to small 
businesses. Currently, it is virtually im-possible for small or new businesses to obtain capital. 
Fifth, leverage social networks and 
evolving technologies to encourage and empower entrepreneurship.
On the wall of Harvard University’s 
Busch-Reisinger’s Museum, there is a German saying, “Du kannst, denn du sollst”—“If you can, you must.”
President Obama, if you can assist 
American citizens to create meaningful, lasting jobs, you must.

UWireNational Hispanic Heritage Month is 
a time for celebrating culture
Every year, Americans observe Nation-
al Hispanic Heritage Month from Sept. 15 
to Oct. 15 to celebrate the histories, cultures and contributions of Americans who trace their ancestors from Mexico, Spain, the Ca-ribbean and Central and South America.
Hispanic Heritage Week began under 
President Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and was expanded under President Ronald Reagan in 1988 to encompass a 30-day period. It was enacted into law on Aug.17, 1988.
Sept. 15 is chosen as the start date be-
cause of its significance as the anniversary of independence for Latin American coun-tries Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. 
Mexico and Chile celebrate their inde-
pendence days on Sept.16 and Sept. 18, respectively . 
The Hispanic population is the larg-
est racial minority in the U.S., comprising roughly 50.5 million (about 16.3 percent of the total U.S. population). 
U.S. Census Bureau data projects that 
the Hispanic population, as of July 1, 2050, will be 132.8 million, or 30 percent of the total U.S. population. 
According to the census data, it was a 
43 percent increase from April 1, 2000, to April 1, 2010, making Hispanics the fastest growing minority group in the U.S.
The Chamber of Hispanic Affairs in 
Gainesville cordially invites you to our most notable program, known as the an-nual Downtown Latino Festival, which takes place at the Bo Diddley Community Plaza downtown every September during National Hispanic Heritage Month.
The family friendly celebration attracts 
vendors and community members from all over north Florida. 
The purpose of the festival is to cel-
ebrate the positive contributions and achievements of the Latino community . It is a chance for Gainesville to celebrate His-panic Heritage Month with the Chamber of Hispanic Affairs. 
We also strive to connect the Hispanic 
population and  the greater community to resources such as health awareness, dis-ease testing, non-profits and community resources. 
Attendance at the festival has usually 
been between 600 and 2,000 people every year.
The event consists of food vendors, in-
formational booths, cultural performances and live music. 
The festival is free and open to the pub-
lic. 
We cordially invite the entire commu-
nity to enjoy this community celebration.

Pointing out that young people spend more than 
40 hours a week in front of TV and computer screens,

“We need to educate, starting with young people,” 
O’Connor said. “Those are our future voters.” 
Florida Supreme Court Justice Peggy Quince, who 
was also on the panel at the Phillips Center, said the biggest problem is people not thinking for themselves and instead being told what to think by the media and talk shows. 
“Americans take [talk shows] as gospel,” Quince 
said. 
Martha Barnett, moderator and former American 
Bar Association president, said education on the ju-dicial system is the responsibility of the American public.
At University Auditorium, O’Connor said the 
United States education system is “unacceptable” and said that Americans should make civics education a requirement to re-engage citizens.

The organizing committee for the London Olympic Games has invited the UF 
Fightin’ Gator Marching Band to play at the 2012 Olympics.

Two years ago, Watkins said, 
the band was invited to perform 
at a music festival in Venezuela. However, due to safety concerns, the group didn’t pursue the op-portunity.
The UF Fightin’ Gator March-
ing Band has 330 members and re-hearses six to eight hours a week.
Jason Kossis, a computer engi-
neering junior, said traveling with the band to away football games is like traveling with a second fam-ily.
Kossis, a trumpet player who 
has been in the band for two years, said it’s a once-in-a-lifetime op-portunity to play in the Olympics. 
The entire band has been invit-
ed to go to London, but the cost of the trip may stop some members from attending, Watkins said.
“I don’t think the university 
could subsidize everyone,” Wat-kins said. “People would have to pay, and that would have an im-pact.”
A written invitation is expected 
by late September. When that ar -

Andreas Gregory Christofakis,

About 2,000 UF students risk 
losing their Bright Futures scholar -
ships if they do not fill out a federal 
financial aid form.
According to a statewide rule 
implemented this summer, stu-dents must fill out a complete, er -
ror-free Free Application for Feder -
al Student Aid form to receive their Bright Futures scholarships. UF of-ficials sent emails and postcards to students over the summer to warn them about the change.
After the first tuition deadlines 
passed, officials determined that about 2,000 students still have not submitted an error-free form, said Rick Wilder, the interim director for the UF Office of Student Financial Affairs.
“Some students may not give 
the forms and forgo their scholar -
ship,” Wilder said.
Wilder said Bright Futures 
scholarships were awarded to 26,292 students last year, which is roughly 74 percent of undergradu-ate, in-state students. The program paid out $77,498,667 through the scholarships, which are awarded to students based on their high school academic records. 
Recipients of the Florida Aca-
demic Scholars award, which is the highest scholarship offered, have their scholarships automatically re-newed each year if they enroll in at least 12 academic credit hours per semester and maintain a 3.0 cumu-lative GPA.
Biochemistry junior Scott Hef-
fley said he didn’t understand the new requirement.
“It makes no sense to fill out a 
form for federal need-based aid in order to receive a merit-based scholarship that has nothing to do with federal aid whatsoever,” Hef-fley said.
Florida legislators voted to have 
students fill out the form to gather background information about those receiving the scholarships, according to Alligator archives. 
Financial records do not affect 
the amount of money students re-ceive. 
A spokesperson from the Florida 
Department of Education was not available at press time.
There is no deadline to com-
plete the form, Wilder said. Those students who have not completed it will receive their scholarship as long as the form is received within the academic year. 
If students submit their forms in 
January, they will be paid retroac-tively and receive their full scholar -
ships.
Bright Futures scholarships, 
which are about $3,030 per year for the Florida Academic Scholars award, are usually divided between the fall and spring semesters.
“If students are still interested 
in getting their Bright Futures, the best thing to do is get their form in,” Wilder said.
The Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid form can be found on-line at fasfa.ed.gov.

A High Springs man ac-
cused of fatally shooting his 
wife and son was transferred to the Alachua County Jail on Monday. 
Russell Dewayne Hogg, 58, 
is charged with two counts of premeditated capital murder.
The motive behind the 
murders is uncertain but may have involved an ongoing family dispute concerning a black pickup truck found at the scene, said Sgt. Todd Kelly, Alachua County Sher -
iff’s Office public information officer. 
The Alachua County Sher -
iff’s Office received a 911 call at 12:59 p.m. Sunday and re-sponded along with the High Springs Police Department to 240 SW Poe Springs Road in High Springs, where two gunshot victims were found in the front yard, according to an ASO news release.
Officers said 48-year-old Trenda Owens Hogg and 22-year-old Anthony Wayne Hogg, a construction worker, were pronounced dead at the scene.
Russell Dewayne Hogg 
was identified as a suspect due to witness accounts, Kelly said. According to an Alachua County Jail arrest report, an 
AK-47 was used in the shootings.
Depu-
ties from the Colum-bia County S h e r i f f ’ s O f f i c e found and 
detained Hogg on Highway 441 on the same day, accord-ing to a news release. 
“It’s a shocker to have … 
a double homicide in a small community like High Springs, but at least there’s some com-fort in the people knowing the person responsible was quickly apprehended,” Kelly said.Local man charged

� MUSCHAMP CHANGING GATORS’ 
APPROACH TO RIVALRY GAMES.
TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
 
When it comes to rivalry games, Will Mus-
champ is more subdued than his predecessor.
Urban Meyer was famous for trying to rev 
his players up the week before playing Tennes-
see, Georgia or Florida State. There were mo-tivational posters. There were videos of past meetings. And, while coaching at Utah, there were decals of BYU’s logo on urinal cakes.
No more. Almost every player available 
to the media Monday said this week’s game is just like the other two — the ones in which Florida beat FAU and UAB by a combined score of 80-3. 
“I don’t like to treat any game different from 
one another,” Muschamp said. “It’s the next one and therefore it’s the most important. It’s a great rivalry. It’s in the (Southeastern Con-ference) East, and it’s a game we need to play well in and win. It’s a very important game; we don’t need to tell our players that.”
Muschamp has told his team to approach 
each Saturday as if it is facing “nameless, face-less” opponents. Most players echoed that sen-
timent Monday, and ju-nior Lerentee McCray went as far as to call Tennessee “the orange-and-white team.” 
Trey Burton was the only player who ad-
mitted Saturday’s game will be more impor -
tant than the first two.
“It’s a conference game,” he said. “Our goal 
is to get to Atlanta, and if we don’t win this game, we don’t go to Atlanta.”
Slive hopeful about A&M: SEC Commis-
sioner Mike Slive talked conference expansion during a speaking engagement in Birming-ham, Ala., on Monday night. 
“We remain optimistic that Texas A&M 
will be a member of the SEC and have started to look at schedules for 2012-13 involving 13 teams,” he said.
The presidents of SEC universities voted 
unanimously to accept A&M’s bid to join the conference Sept. 5, but the move was put on hold as at least one Big 12 university did not waive its right to sue A&M and the SEC. Re-ports have since surfaced that as many as six of the Big 12’s nine remaining schools have re-fused to waive their rights to sue.
Slive, however, reiterated that the SEC will 
welcome A&M as soon as it can legally leave the Big 12. He was  mum on future expansion.
“When Texas A&M joins our conference, 
we don’t have immediate plans for a 14th member,” he said. “We aren’t thinking in terms of numbers.  We think about the strength of the 
SEC and the attractiveness of Texas A&M as an institution.”
Talkin’, talkin’: Muschamp was told dur -
ing Saturday’s win against UAB that his play-ers were getting too chatty in between snaps. 
“At halftime I walked in and told them you 
do the talking with your helmet and shut up and play the game,” he said. “That’s really all it is. Guys that want to run their mouth all the time generally aren’t playing very good.”
Injuries: Cornerback Jeremy Brown (knee) 
is questionable. Brown suffered the injury dur -
ing the first week of training camp, and Mus-champ initially thought his cornerback would return before the season opener.
“The injury is much more severe than we 
first thought,” he said Monday.
Muschamp was hopeful that tight end A.C. 
Leonard would be available to practice Mon-day for the first time since suffering a torn meniscus Aug. 6. Jeff Demps (Muschamp’s de-scription: “bang” on the shoulder) and Jordan Reed (“twinge” somewhere) are probable.

A little more than one week 
ago, Florida’s volleyball team 
could do no wrong. 
The Gators cruised through 
their first six matches in a mini-mum total of 18 sets, winning each frame by an average of 9.17 points. While the joyride was great for fans and statistics, it 
served as little more than a warm-up for the team.
Only half 
of Florida’s 
opening six matches were against teams that had a win-
ning record in 2010, and Florida State is the only team to enter the O’Connell Center ranked in the AVCA Top 25.
That all changed last week 
when the Gators went up against three consecutive teams ranked in the top 12.
“It’s who we played,” UF 
coach Mary Wise said. 
“The quality of the competi-
tion and how good those teams are.”

A 295-pound void in the Gators’ front seven will be 
filled this weekend.
After serving a two-game suspension handed down by 
the NCAA for receiving impermissible benefits while still 
in high school, defensive lineman Sharrif Floyd will make his season debut when Florida opens Southeastern Confer -
ence play against Tennessee on Saturday.
With the Gators struggling at times with the pass rush 
this season, Floyd’s return to the lineup couldn’t come soon enough.
“[Floyd] has a great pass-rush ability,” linebacker Jelani 
Jenkins said. 
“With him on the field it makes everybody’s job easier. Definitely when the quarterback is backing up to pass, es-pecially a good quarterback like Tennessee has, it makes it a lot easier.”
Floyd watched from the sidelines as Florida’s defense 
posted just two sacks against Florida Atlantic in the sea-son opener and then failed to record one against UAB last weekend. 
The 6-foot-3 sophomore couldn’t help on the field, but 
linebacker Lerentee McCray said Floyd was like another Gators hope Floyd’s return helps bolster sagging pass rushWise

THE RALLY
GREG: Even as Chris Rainey darts 
over, around and past would-be 
tacklers, some people take away 
more concern than optimism.
Rainey’s 317 yards from scrimmage this 
year are more than double the total of any-one else on the team, but Gators fans seem more wowed by the volume of his touches than by what he’s done with them.
Rainey is clearly on top of his game 
with a 7.3 yards per carry average. That number tops even the 7.2 mark he put up last year, which would’ve tied for third in the nation if he’d met the minimum num-ber of attempts to qualify.
I’m fine with Rainey touching the ball 
as many as 25 times per game, and I don’t 
see why it’d be any other way.
MATT: You can’t be serious. 
While there’s little doubt Rainey is the 
most dynamic playmaker on the roster, the thought of him touching the ball 25 times a game is downright ludicrous. In his entire career at Florida, Rainey has never carried the rock more than 89 times in an entire season. He’s also never had more than 99 touches from scrimmage, but you advo-cate a season in which he would accumu-late more than 300. 
Starting this Saturday, you’ll see exact-
ly why your plan is flawed, Greg. 
In the Southeastern Conference, the 
linebackers and safeties are the real deal. They have the speed to close on Rainey off the edge. And, most importantly, they have the strength and power to pound his tiny frame so far down  into the 
dirt that he’ll be begging to see the sideline. 
We saw this 
last season when Jeff Demps toted it 26 times against Tennessee in the SEC opener — he was never the same.  
Why tempt fate when there are so many 
other options? 
GREG: You tempt fate because the 
whole idea is to get your best playmakers the ball as many times as you can.
A healthy Chris Rainey is worth about 
as much as an injured one if you’re going to keep him standing on the sidelines any-way.
Most skilled fantasy football players — 
a group I can assume you don’t fall into based on the ragtag crew of flunkies you put together in our draft — know about the alleged “Curse of 370,” which claims that any back who reaches that number of touches in a season typically slows down in subsequent years.
This shouldn’t be a concern for Rainey, 
who hasn’t even recorded 370 touches over the course of his entire career and has the luxury of ending a play out of bounds or in the end zone more often than a lot of other backs.
The anxiety isn’t over wearing him 
down — it’s about injuries. But Rainey takes an injury risk every day in practice, and ev-ery morning he gets out of bed. 
You won’t get 
anywhere playing scared, and the Gators shouldn’t play scared with 
Rainey.
MATT: Lolz. Really, Greg? Really?  
My fantasy prowess aside (my team, by the way, put up the exact same 110 points yours did in Week 1), your argument is senseless and baseless. 
Rainey is electric, there’s no deny-
ing that, but he is best used sparingly.  The Gators have multiple playmaking op-tions, especially in the run game, and the strength of their offense is the defense not knowing who will get the ball. With Rainey injured and out because you gave him more touches in two games than he’s had in any two his entire career, the Gators chances of winning diminish significantly.
What’s wrong with Demps all of a 
sudden? Is he chopped liver just because Rainey displayed a couple of spin moves?  What about Mike Gillislee, who was explo-sive in his first taste of extended action? Trey Burton is another option, as is the hu-mongous and talented Hunter Joyer.
Basically, what you’re describing is 
very similar to how you’re justifying it — 
fantasy. GREG: There’s nothing wrong with 
Demps. He’s a fine player and, by all ac-
counts, a Rainey clone with fewer moves. He can still get a few carries per game, as can Burton in the wildcat.
But, if Rainey keeps up his insane aver -
age, Florida needs to keep giving him the ball. Sure, the Gators have other options. But if Rainey is good for 7 yards per play, why use them?
And if that average goes down or Rain-
ey gets hurt, UF has the perfect backup. Demps isn’t a reason to give Rainey fewer carries, he’s an insurance policy that lets them work Rainey even harder.  
The idea of players like Gillislee and 
Joyer stealing caries from Florida’s best player is silly to me. If UF finds itself in a spot where it needs to make plays and put up points, the ball needs to be in Rainey’s hands.
The guys playing behind him are there 
for a reason, to back him up. Little more.
MATT: I’m glad this edition of The Ral-
ly is coming to close, so we can save the readers some time reading more nonsense from “The Worst Writer in Alligator His-tory.”
You’ve contradicted yourself so much 
in this column it’s not even funny. Rainey is a one-note back — albeit a damn good one — but he is not a featured back and should not be used as such.

coach on the sideline, breaking down the opposing 
team and giving tips to the Gators’ front seven.
But with his return to the field imminent, any on-
field boost Floyd can now give his team in the pass rush will be much needed against a Tennessee squad that ranks ninth in the nation in passing offense, and Mc-Cray said he expects pass-rushing to be a major empha-sis in practice this week.
“We need to get pressure with four guys rushing,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “That’s the best pass de-fense in the America. We need to rush four guys and do a better job at that.”
While the entire front seven 
needs to improve its pass-rushing efforts, Muschamp specifically said that sophomore Buck line-
backer Ronald Powell must be one of those players to do a better job of getting to the quarterback and affect-ing him, whether it’s a sack, a hurry or a hit.
But the Gators hope Floyd, who is widely consid-
ered one of the best pass-rushers on the team, can also have an impact against Tennessee quarterback Tyler Bray, who has completed 78.5 percent of his passes this season. 
Floyd signed with Florida out of high school as the 
top-rated defensive tackle recruit in the nation, accord-ing to Rivals.com, but is expected to play both tackle and defensive end in the Gators’ revamped defense. 
Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said before the 
season that Floyd will play end — a position he has yet to field — in the Gators’ base defense, and shift to tackle in the team’s nickel package.
“Sharrif brings size, speed, athleticism — he just 
brings a lot to [the defensive end] position that you can’t normally get from a guy my size or somebody of my stature,” said the 6-foot-2, 246-pound McCray. “He’s a big guy, he’s fast, quick, powerful.”

Though the Gators are less 
than a month into their season, 
UF coach Becky Burleigh feels like the team has already been through a round of the playoffs.
With three ranked opponents played so far and two more road games pegged for this weekend, No. 9 Florida (5-2) has tried to test itself against potential NCAA Tournament teams during its non-conference slate.
But the Gators’ 1-2 record 
against quality opponents — in-cluding a 3-2 loss to No. 5 Florida State last Friday — indicates the squad is lucky the postseason is still months away.
“We’re going to see this team 
again,” Burleigh said after the FSU game. “We’re going to see teams of this caliber again, and to play teams like this at this point of the season is exactly what we need.”
The Gators’ starting 11 looked 
shell-shocked at times by the intensity of the Seminoles’ at-tack, which was led by the ever-dangerous Tiffany McCarty. The forward scored the game-winner and added another goal and an assist. 
“I honestly just don’t think we 
were ready for that,” junior mid-fielder Erika Tymrak said. “They are a top team; now we know how they play. I wish we played them again. I hope we play them again.”
The result was achingly simi-
lar to Florida’s first loss of the season to No. 6 UCLA in which the Bruins capitalized on a failed clearance and a missed through ball by UF en route to a 2-0 win.
For assistant coach Alan 
Kirkup, the only thing holding UF back when it plays teams of a similar class is the number of mental mistakes, which he said the Gators need to cut back on.
“You try and test yourself all 
the time,” he said. “We’re disap-pointed we lost two games. The UCLA game (we had) a couple of naive defensive errors; there was a couple more on Friday night.”
With No. 19 Tennessee as the 
only other ranked Southeastern Conference team, Florida looks once again to have a favorable table when league play starts on Sept. 23 — a contrast to FSU’s draw in the Atlantic Coast Con-ference, where eight teams  are currently ranked. 
The Gators have won the last 
five SEC regular-season titles and haven’t lost more than twice to conference opponents in a single season since 2002, meaning UF’s toughest tests in preparation for the postseason have likely already happened. 
“We’re right in the mix, and 
we’re right where we need to be,” Kirkup said. “We continue to grow as a team, and these two games coming up this next weekend will just help us in that regard.
“This team will be a lot better 
in November and December than we are right now.”

ARREST , from page 1Seventh 
arrest under Muschampnoticed the escalated level of op-
position. 
After a smooth start to 2011, 
Florida quickly fell behind 0-2 to Iowa State on Labor Day before rallying to lose in an error-filled fifth set. 
At the Nike Big Four Classic 
in Palo Alto, Calif., during the weekend, No. 7 Florida went five sets against both No. 8 Texas and No. 2 Stanford, splitting with a win and a loss, respectively.
“Physically, the great thing is 
we’re young and we’re in terrific shape,” Wise said. “So (playing three five-set games) shouldn’t be a problem.”
In fact, Wise sees nothing but 
positives coming out of a rig-orous week in which her team went up against three of the best squads in the nation. 
Florida out-hit its opponents 
by an average of .231 to .184, and it also saw a resurgence from red-shirt freshman libero Taylor Un-roe, who recorded 42 digs in Palo Alto after a rough outing against Iowa State.
“If the Texas and Stanford 
matches were any indication, that’s where we made the biggest jump from the Iowa State match was in our backcourt play,” Wise said. 
“There’s still balls that are 
falling to the floor that shouldn’t be, but it was a whole different mindset.”
The veteran coach added she 
might have considered the week a success even if Florida had lost some of the matches in straight sets. 
She said facing the teams the 
Gators faced gives them an imme-diate advantage as they prepare to begin Southeastern Conference play, which starts on Friday with a trip to Starkville, Miss., to take on Mississippi State. 
“It’s not at a huge gap for 
us to compete against the very best teams in the country, and I think that the players are highly encouraged,” she said. “Disap-pointed in losing, but encouraged in what lies ahead.”16, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2011

Forget about any freshman 
jitters. 
In her second collegiate 
round, Camilla Hedberg shot 
a team-best 5-under 67 to help Florida remain in second at Yeamans Hall Club in Hana-han, S.C. on Monday . 
Hedberg tallied seven bird-
ies — five on her front nine — and only two bogeys. She is tied for third on the Cougar Classic leaderboard,  three shots behind Tennessee’s Erica Popson. 
“Camilla was just a blast 
to watch. She hit the ball great and hit it close,” said coach Jan Dowling. “Not only did she make a bunch of birdie putts, but she made a lot of par putts. Great putting, very impres-sive.”
The Gators finished 4 under 
par for the second consecutive day for a two-round score of 568 (284-284, -8). Florida is only one shot behind leader North Carolina, last year’s tourna-ment winner. 
LSU sits in third at 5 under 
par, and North Carolina State remains in fourth at one-over. 
Seven of the schools sitting 
in the top 10 are Southeastern Conference teams. 
Junior Mia Piccio and senior 
Evan Jensen finished the day at even par. Each shot a 1-under 71  in the opening round. 
Jensen also made five bird-
ies Monday . 
Senior Andrea Watts had 
a rough day as she finished the day 10 over with five bo-geys and three double bogeys. Despite her shaky play so far, Dowling said she believes Watts is capable of playing bet-ter today . 
Dowling also said she has 
enjoyed the Gators’ consistent play and how they have avoid-ed “any major mistakes” on the course. However, she still sees room for improvement. 
“We were a little bit sloppy 
with our scoring clubs [Mon-day]. We had some free putts that were disappointing,” Dowling said. “We’re looking to get a little bit sharper with our scoring clubs.”
Asked about her team’s 
chances of contending, and possibly winning the tourna-ment, Dowling said she was confident and excited for the challenge.
“It’s going to be fun [today], 
being in contention in our first event [of the year]. It’s what we’re trying to do every week,” she said. “We’re just looking for more of the same tomorrow. Let’s see if we can catch UNC and make a run at the champi-onship.”Hedberg goes low,
