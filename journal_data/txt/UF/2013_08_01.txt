An unidentified man made a burglary at-
tempt Tuesday at a Gainesville house where 
three UF students live.
At about 6 p.m., one of the students came 
home to the 900 block of Southwest First Avenue to find a man he didn’t know in the bedroom of a roommate, according to a press release from Gainesville Police spokesman Of-
ficer Ben Tobias.
The student told the man — who entered 
the house through an unlocked door — to 
empty his pockets and made him leave, ac-cording to the release. No arrest was made.
After the man left, the student found elec-
tronics and clothes were missing. The man tried to steal six laptops and two Xbox 360s, according to an incident report.
“The items were discovered in a garbage bag and a cargo bag, stashed in another room, ready to be taken away,” Tobias wrote. “This is a perfect example of why people need to 
lock their homes.”
In the past week, 10 people have been ar-
rested on charges related to burglary, accord-
ing to Alachua County Jail logs.
Some of the burglaries coincide with the 
college move-in/move-out period, but police say it’s tough to tie strings of burglaries to spe-cific reasons.
However, Tobias said, patterns of burglary 
can be seasonal.“During the summer months, it comes and 
goes in waves,” Tobias said. “Criminals know that people are moving around and leaving 
stuff unsecured.”
Art Forgey, the Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office spokesman, said break-ins typically 
happen during the daytime. He suggests mak-ing residences look “lived in” to avoid attract-ing crime.
“It doesn’t cost much to leave your porch 
light on,” he said. “That tends to drive the 
criminal element away.”Daytime robbery attempt a reminder to take precautionsCAMPUS

When Kemia Harris first entered 
Carleton Auditorium for her precal-
culus algebra class freshman year, she saw more than just a crowd of students trying to learn in unison.
“I loved the painting of Albert and 
Alberta on the wall and how spacious the room was,” said the 21-year-old telecommunications senior. 
That painting is now covered with three 20-foot-wide projection screens to display content from wide-screen, high-definition projectors. 
Students this Fall will notice digital 
renovations to the Carleton Auditori-um, two Turlington Hall lecture class-rooms and Griffin-Floyd Hall’s room 
100. According to the UF Information 
Technology website, the goal was to upgrade teaching and learning spaces with technology like new audio sys-tems and projection screens, videocon-ferencing equipment and high-quality lecture capture capabilities.
“I like the fact that they are using 
our world of digital technology and incorporating that into helping us learn,” Harris said. “It’s mixing the old with the new.”
UF Academic Technology class-
room support supervisor Phi Nguyen said the renovations were part of an effort to help UF toward the top 10 ranking.

Seven burn patients at 
UF Health Shands Hospital 
were recently diagnosed 
with an infection known 
to attack the already ill.
Over four months, some 
patients in the burn unit 
became infected with the 
bacterium acinetobacter baumannii. Those infected were moved to isolation areas. All other patients 
have been removed from 
the burn unit, according to Chief Medical Officer Timothy Flynn in an email from spokeswoman Ros-sana Passaniti.
Antimicrobial agents 
have been used to treat the infected patients.
No one currently has a 
known active infection of the bacteria at the hospital, according to Shands. 
The infections were 
discovered during a rou-
tine patient check. Burn 
victims are examined rou-tinely due to their vulner-ability to infection. 
Acinetobacter bauman-
nii is a common bacteria found in soil and water, according to the Centers for Disease Control’s web-site. Outbreaks typically occur in intensive care units, as healthy people 
are not normally affected 
by the bacteria.
Symptoms include a 
variety of diseases includ-ing pneumonia and seri-
ous blood or wound infec-
tions. 
Burn victims are still 
being treated by the same specialty staff in other ar-eas of the hospital, accord-ing to Shands. 
Prior to the outbreak, 
the burn unit had been scheduled for renovations.
“We decided to take 
this opportunity to start the renovations now,” Flynn wrote in Passiniti’s email. “The renovations should return us to the 
eight-bed unit we have al-
ways had.”Shands burn unit

Owner could face charges for 
venomous snakes 
SALT LAKE CITY — Firefight-
ers arrived at a Utah home to put 
out a blaze started by a kitchen 
range and discovered more than 
flames — 28 snakes, six of them 
deadly.
The man didn’t have a permit 
for the six venomous snakes — wood Heights police cited a young man for failure to have an 
exotic pet permit and initially or-
dered him to get rid of all but one 
of his 29 boa constrictors he kept 
in a special room in his basement 
with top-of-the-line cages.
The Cottonwood Heights City 
Council later gave him a reprieve, allowing Thomas Cobb to keep 
his snakes while officials revisit the city code.
Cobb still has the snakes he 
says are worth $12,000 apiece, and is awaiting a resolution 
from city officials, Cottonwood 
Heights Police Sgt. Mark Asker-
lund said.
Trashed Mass. lottery ticket a 
$1M winner 
NORTH ATTLEBOROUGH, 
Mass. — A Massachusetts couple 
has won $1 million on a scratch-
off lottery ticket they dug out 
of the trash after inadvertently 
throwing it away.
The state lottery commission 
says Joseph and Joanne Zagami 
of North Attleborough bought 
the $5 ticket from a vending ma-
chine while grocery shopping.
They stuck the ticket in a bag 
and forgot about it.
The next day, Joseph Zag-
ami asked his wife if she had 
scratched the ticket. She hadn’t. 
They dug through the trash and found it.
The couple claimed their 
prize Wednesday, opting for the one-time lump sum payment of $650,000 before taxes and 
$455,000 after. They plan to pay 
off their mortgage and other bills 
and take a vacation.
To get the full amount they 
would have needed to claim the prize over 20 years.
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSfive rattlers and a gaboon viper 
— and he may face misdemean-
or charges for keeping them 
without a permit. The African-native viper is considered one of the most dangerous in the 
world with its potent venom.
The snakes were inside cag-
es in a separate room and were removed as firefighters quickly 
put out the blaze on Friday in 
Clearfield, about 30 miles north 
of Salt Lake City.
“I don’t think firefighters 
were ever in danger from the 
snakes, except for the creep 
factor,” said North Davis Fire 
Chief Mark Becraft.
The poisonous snakes were 
confiscated by the Utah Divi-
sion of Wildlife, where Capt. 
Tony Wood was trying to deter-
mine their fate — and whether to cite the owner.
“I’m just trying to wrap my 
head around the situation,” he 
said Monday.
Fire and smoke damage left 
the man’s duplex uninhabit-
able, Becraft said, but all the 
snakes survived.
The owner took his 22 other 
legal snakes for safekeeping to his father’s house, Davis Coun-
ty Animal Control Director Clint Thacker said.
The seized rattlers will prob-
ably be released into the wild, 
and the viper could be sent to 
someone authorized to have it, said Jim Dix of Reptile Rescue 
of Tooele County.
The owner has been de-
scribed variously by officials as 
a snake professional or breeder. 
Dix said the snakes were well 
fed, in good condition and that there was no threat to anyone 
in the neighborhood.
“We are seeing a big increase 
in illegal animals in Utah,” he said. “It just goes on and on.”
Dix said he was working 
with Utah officials to designate 
“amnesty” days for unlicensed owners who are willing to turn 
over exotic animals.

Orange and blue is part of a recipe for tailgate festivi-
ties on a Food Network episode premiering today.
An episode of “Emeril’s Florida” airs at 9:30 a.m. fea-
turing tailgating at the Florida vs. Florida State game, 
which took place on Nov. 24 in Tallahassee.
The episode includes interviews with former Gator 
quarterback Chris Leak and Candi Fisher, the wife of FSU Head Coach Jimbo Fisher. 
In the episode, Emeril Lagasse cooks tailgating favor-
ites with his son at the game and hosts a cook-off competi-tion between two Gators and two Seminoles. 
Spoiler alert: The Gators win.During the show, Emeril cooks recipes such as bacon 
potato salad, barbecue ribs and pork roast with home-made barbecue sauce.
“We wanted to highlight the great Florida experiences, including college football,” said Carol 
Dover, president and CEO of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association.
Nicole Vassallo, a UF public relations 
senior, said Monday that she planned to tune in.
“I grew up watching Emeril, and I’m 
curious to see what he has to say about 
the tailgating experience between such 
big rival schools,” Vassallo said.  
“I’m sure he’ll find a way to come up with some inter-
esting recipes students can try out that’ll spice up tailgat-
ing even more.”Bam! Emeril brings the heat to Florida in college rival cook-off

Say farewell to the most saturated 
month of July in Gainesville’s history.
The city has seen 16.61 inches of rain 
in July, according to a tweet by WRUF 
Weather (UF), which is nearly triple the average of about 6 inches.
Since recordkeeping began in 1890, 
rainfall in Gainesville during the month of July has never surpassed 16.41 inches — the record set in 1909, according to National Weather Service archives.
Only 3.91 inches of rain dampened 
the city in July 2012, according to Florida Forest Service data.
Wednesday included a flash flood 
warning for central Alachua County, during which about 3.68 inches of rain drenched the city, according to The Weather Channel’s website. 
But the higher levels of precipitation 
for this season aren’t uncommon, said 
Katia Matcheva, a UF weather profes-
sor.
“Although the amount of rain might 
be somewhat unusual, the frequency of the storms are normal,” she said.
Matcheva said that Florida is separat-
ed by distinct wet and dry seasons, and July is typically the wettest month of the wet season.
While students may be growing 
tired of the city’s “Rainesville” alter ego, Matcheva said attendance in her class-es hasn’t seemed to be affected by the weather.
“Students are not scared of rain,” she 
said. “If they want to come, they come.”City breaks 104-year-old

term has a smaller student popula-tion, making it easier to enter the class-rooms.
“The four classrooms this summer 
is just a small fraction of the amount of classrooms we are working on this summer,” he said. “Thirty or even 40 classrooms have already been digitally changed.”
Nguyen said the classroom digital upgrades are part of a four-year plan to upgrade all 250 of UF’s general classrooms to digital high-definition capability.
Carleton Auditorium was UFIT’s 
largest renovation project for summer 2013, according to its website. Water damage repairs and improvements to lighting, stage accessibility and the au-dio system were completed before the start of Summer B.
Nguyen said the Carleton Audition 
was a special project because it was dated and dark.
“All new technology equipment 
and new digital processors,” Nguyen said. “We did a full rip-out and rein-stall as far as technology.” 
Nguyen did not disclose how much 
the renovation cost. 
Other classroom technology proj-
ects this summer include the instal-lation of improved lecture recording capabilities in two Turlington rooms, which will enable higher quality lec-ture footage, according to UFIT’s site. 4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 1, 2013

Gainesville residents expressed mixed reactions to U.S. 
Census Bureau statistics that show poverty rates decreas-
ing in many college towns where off-campus graduate and undergraduate college students are excluded.
According to data released in the spring, 24.6 percent of 
Alachua County, including students, is below poverty level. Excluding students from the data decreases the county’s poverty level to 16.1 percent. 
UF microeconomics professor Mark Rush said that ex-
cluding students from poverty data, and basing it on per-manent residents alone, presents the data more accurately. 
“I understand the students’ perspective, but student 
poverty is a different kind of poverty,” he said. “It’s tempo-rarily living in poverty for a couple of years and then later 
working and bringing in more income.” 
However, Deniss Kaskurs, a 22-year-old UF political sci-
ence and economics senior, said the new data is an “inaccu-
rate reflection of the true poverty level of college town.”
Kaskurs said if the Census Bureau wants more accurate 
data on poverty, it should include students. He said this data will decrease the average income level. 
Jeremiah Tattersall, an organizer for the Alachua County 
Wage Theft Task Force, said he was disturbed when he read 
the data. He said removing students from the data assumes 
they don’t contribute to the local economy.
Tattersall said the city’s workforce includes about 50,000 
students, and of that number, about 4,000 graduate students who work full time.
“This is very misleading to exclude students from pov-
erty,” he said. “It seems unfair.”Students excluded

Child campers will see 
some mad science today com-
ing from UF.
UF’s Mad Scientists Club 
will perform at Camp Kesem 
UF, an Ocala summer camp for 
children whose parents have or have had cancer, as part of its community outreach program, said club president Genevieve Comeau. A program director asked the students to put on its Mad Science 101 show, which illustrates scientific principles 
in an exciting way, at a Camp 
Kesem carnival.
The club’s requisition of-
ficer, Drake Polino, said the show will include sections on chemistry, biology and phys-ics. Students will demonstrate an explosive experiment called “Elephant’s Toothpaste,” which explains how plants 
grow from seeds by showing 
electricity traveling up a Ja-cob’s Ladder.
Comeau said the club has 
previously performed a simi-lar science show at Fort Clarke Middle School. She said the club does shows like these to “show the newest generation 
of scientists that it’s OK to push 
the limits and break rules — as long as you have the proper safety equipment on standby.”
The club is relatively new. 
It was formed last Fall by Comeau, who got the idea while in class.
“I was doodling in a history 
of science class, listening to my professor raving about Tycho [Brahe], Kepler and Newton and thinking that most of the breakthroughs these guys made were tinkering around on their own, doing projects that interested them,” Comeau said. “I was sure there were 
others who felt the same.”
There were. Eager members 
formed the club.
“Sure enough, they showed 
up with lots of ideas for proj-
ects,” Comeau said.
Polino said the club is 
student-run, with each of the members chipping in with 
money and ideas for each proj-
ect and performance.
“Seeing the looks of won-
der, amazement and the prom-ise of more young scientists are all the compensation we need,” Polino said.
Joey Siracusa, service chair 
of the club, said he’s excited 
for the Camp Kesem perfor-
mance.
“It gives us the opportu-
nity to show kids how exciting science can be,” he said. “It’s wonderful seeing the kids’ fac-es light up after I plug in our high-voltage Jacob’s Ladder.”Mad Scientists make

The first 500 people in the Reitz 
Union Grand Ballroom on Friday 
night will start their weekend with “Saturday Night Live” show writ-
er Alan Zweibel.
Zweibel, a best-selling comedy 
writer, producer and author, will 
speak at the free Gator Nights event at 8 p.m. Doors will open at 
7:30 p.m.
Zweibel was one of the original 
writers on “SNL” and has worked 
on productions such as “Curb Your Enthusi-
asm,” “Monk” 
and “Late Show 
with David 
Letterman.”
Students will 
be part of Zwei-bel’s presenta-tion as he talks 
about Hollywood comedy writing. 
The event will conclude with a 
book signing at 9 p.m. 
“It’s a good opportunity for stu-
dents to get a few laughs in before 
finals,” said Inter-Residence Hall 
Association president Elliot Gras-so, “and also to learn about how 
Hollywood functions and how 
these TV shows came to be.”
IRHA, the Jewish Student 
Union and Gator Nights are co-
sponsoring Zweibel’s visit. 
“I think it’s a really cool event 
to showcase all of the good things student organizations can do for 
students,” Grasso said.
UF economics senior Cory Yef-
fet, 20, said he’s interested in what 
Zweibel has to say.
“I’m looking forward to seeing

Darts & Laurels
Last week, we issued a dart to those who painted over 
the 34th Street Wall monument to the victims of Danny 
Rolling, the “Gainesville Ripper.” Well, one group on 
campus showed us that there are those who care, after all. This week we’d like to give our ﬁ  rst LAUREL to the mem-
bers of UF’s Humans vs. Zombies who restored the monu-ment. Good job, and thanks!
“Who am I to judge a gay person?” With these words 
Pope Francis has shaken Christendom. It seems like a step 
in the right direction: We want gay people to be as openly 
accepted and welcome in society as straight people. The new pope has been doing lots of novel things lately. For example, Pope Francis has ditched the golden throne and now sits on a wooden one. There’s a long way to go, but small changes like these are admirable. 
It seems the pope is saying that it’s not his place to decide 
the rightness or wrongness of the issue of homosexuality, and that’s a big deal coming from a ﬁ  gure who has classically held moral authority over such issues. We give an iron LAUREL 
to Pope Francis, because we know he might not like the ruby 
one as much.
As you may have heard, whistleblower Bradley Manning 
was convicted of 17 of the 22 counts against him. Some are pleased with the verdict, if only for the fact that Manning was not convicted of the most serious charge — aiding the enemy. Yeah, thanks for not convicting him of something he never should have been charged with in the ﬁ  rst place. 
While the case of Bradley Manning strikes us as slightly 
tricky, there’s no question that he was denied human dignity while he was detained. The message is clear: That’s what you get for catching the government with its pants down. That and maybe 136 years in prison. We give the United States a 
freedom-never-looked-so-cruel-and-unusual DART.
If you haven’t already heard of this next one, look it up. 
You won’t regret it. Fox News recently interviewed scholar of religions Reza Aslan on his new book on Jesus. In classic 
Fox News style, the interviewer drew attention to Aslan’s re-
ligion: “You’re a Muslim, so why would you write a book on 
the founder of Christianity?” The response is golden: “To be 
clear, I am a scholar of religions with four degrees, including 
one in the New Testament and ﬂ  uency in biblical Greek, who has been studying the origins of Christianity for two decades, who also just happens to be a Muslim.” The interview goes way downhill from there, and nine minutes later you wonder how Fox News even let such an embarrassment continue for 
that long. 
For continuing to deliver substandard content, we give 
Fox News a you’re-doing-this-all-on-your-own DART.
That’s all for now, Gators. Chomp those ﬁ  nals!

moval of Hernandez’s brick is premature?Today’s question: Have you ever been robbed?Moving exposes missed connections
I felt an inkling of regret walking past the empty apart-
ment downstairs. I had wanted to introduce myself to my neighbors, a man and woman in their mid-20s who 
shared a car covered in video game-themed stickers. But between UF coursework and keeping up with old friends, 
I hadn’t made time for meeting everyone in my building.
Visiting Craigslist to sell furniture, I imagined posting 
a message in the “Missed Connections” section: “Hello, I 
lived upstairs for a year but never took the initiative to be a good neighbor. I noticed your video game stickers. We should play XBOX sometime because I’m a nerd, too.” I would probably add a caveat about not wanting to seduce them, considering the medium.
As UF students pack up their apartments for the end 
of Summer B, some will notice these missed connections. Watching our neighbors emerge at once on moving day, we see how little — or how much — we’ve connected with our communities: What’s her name? Where does he live? Where has that family been all this time?
Because UF offers hundreds of social opportunities, 
off-campus students can stay busy for four years without becoming part of the Gainesville neighborhoods in which they live. That’s a shame, though, because meeting neigh-
bors is one of the best things students can do to enhance 
their personal safety and well-being.
I realized this last summer while reporting for a story 
about crime prevention. As we cruised around Gainesville in a police SUV, Ofﬁ  cer Ernest Graham told me being a cop is like ﬁ  ghting ﬁ  res: a constant race to extinguish problems before they spread. While police are commonly known for putting out the ﬁ  res — catching and arresting criminals — Graham also focuses on preventing crime through com-
munity organizing.
As we drove through a neighborhood a few blocks 
northeast of UF’s main campus, Graham pointed to the 
house of an 80-year-old woman who lived alone with her dog. He had helped alleviate the resident’s fear of a home invasion by introducing her to her neighbors, who would watch for signs of suspicious activity, and by offering cre-ative safety tips.“Here’s what you might want 
to do,” Graham told her. “Go out and get yourself a big dog bowl, a really big one, for your front porch and a sign that reads ‘At-
tack Dog.’”
“Alright,” the resident said, 
giggling. Her dog was a chihua-
hua.
“This job can be really hard, 
man. It’ll break your heart,” Graham later told me. He must occasionally respond to assaults and robberies, even though neighborhood watch groups have reduced crime in his districts. “But I feel really good when I walk into my 
apartment at the end of the day,” Graham added, smil-
ing.
Besides the personal safety beneﬁ  ts, students who 
make a habit out of meeting their neighbors now may set a good precedent for their future social lives. As students graduate and grow older, their social circles usually con-strict. I’ve heard college alumni in their 40s and 50s say they have fewer opportunities to meet people. They can frequent after-work bars and social groups, but it’s noth-
ing like UF, where they met dozens of like-minded peers 
every semester.
While it’s true that students have more chances to so-
cialize, another reason for their larger social circles is a change in mentality. Teenagers who move from various parts of Florida to Gainesville have to be a little more out-going to establish new groups of friends. Starting a con-versation with a classmate or roommates from another suite may feel uncomfortable, especially for the introverts 
among us, but it’s a necessity if you want to grow roots 
during your ﬁ  rst year at UF.
In the spirit of keeping up this mentality, I challenge all 
UF students who are moving this week, including myself, to meet their neighbors within 10 days of joining a new community.

Living in Gainesville, you’re bound to 
find several sports bars and restaurants fit for 
a college student — Gator football memora-
bilia, big-screen televisions, delicious food, a 
friendly atmosphere and all at a great price. If this sounds like a place you’re looking for, look no further than Beef O’Brady’s.
Not to be confused with the restaurant 
on 13th Street, Beef O’Brady’s in Millhopper Square gives you the standard sports bar atmosphere without all the student hype. It’s the perfect place for you to bring your 
family or a couple of friends for a laid-back 
meal. 
Similar to Gainesville Ale House and 
Chili’s, the restaurant’s staple foods include 
burgers, barbecue ribs, wings and fajitas. If 
you’re looking for gourmet cuisine, this isn’t the place for you. But it’s a great option if you’re looking for a place that isn’t exhaust-ed by large crowds of students.
When I went with a friend of mine, the 
atmosphere was very quiet and relaxed. There were more families and older adults than students. Our waitress was extremely 
helpful and friendly. She was patient and 
didn’t feel the need to constantly come to our table.
If you do happen to go with a friend, a 
great appetizer to try is the Ribs and Ten-ders. My friend and I shared this, and even 
for a standard meal, it definitely impressed 
me. The meat is incredibly moist and practi-cally falls off the bone.
The same goes for the chicken tenders. 
They’re crispy enough to give you that extra 
kick without being too brittle and go per-
fectly with some barbecue sauce. As for the entrees, I had the O’Brady Burger, while my friend had the Grilled Chicken entree.  
The O’Brady Burger is very much like 
your average burger. It’s complete with fresh Angus beef, provolone cheese, mayo, let-tuce, tomato, pickles and onion. I wouldn’t say it’s the best thing on the menu, but it’s not a bad choice. Be prepared to take home leftovers as it is a large helping.
Surprisingly, the Grilled Chicken entree 
was delectable enough to forget the restau-rant’s true staple. It comes with rice and broccoli and is grilled to perfection. The 
chicken isn’t overpowering, but the meal is 
succulent enough to taste the various herbs and spices used in the seasoning.

Dragonfly Sushi & Sake Company in the 
downtown Gainesville area offers diners a 
modern take on Japanese cuisine. I arrived Saturday at 9 p.m. Even at this hour, there was a line out the door, and the expected wait time 
for a table for two was 30 minutes. Dragon-
fly offers large cushioned seating and a few chairs for waiting outside — although dirty and sticky due to humidity and exposure to the Florida elements.   
When we were finally seated, our server 
was very friendly and happy to answer any questions. She brought us water, described the drink and dinner specials, and continued to take our order. This was very difficult, 
though, because of the overall noise level. The 
décor is modern with Asian accent pieces and TVs playing old black-and-white Japanese Samurai movies.
Our waitress was impressively able to serve 
at least three tables at a time without writing down any orders. That being said, forgetting that a water glass should be refilled occasion-ally cancels out the achievement.
All the food arrived at the same time. This 
was OK even though the edamame is listed as an appetizer and expected to arrive before the entrees. The vegetable and sauce mixture in the pork buns gave just enough kick to make them very tasty once I doctored the pork meat and removed the fat. This, by the way, is not an easy task to accomplish with chopsticks.
The best way to describe the two chicken 
spears we ordered is to pass along the names I gave to the order: I called one “dry” and the other one “bland.” Enough said.  The Tampa Bay roll was another disappointment — eas-ily falling apart and not served with ginger or wasabi, which is normally expected.
Opah, sometimes called Moonfish, was the 
fish special of the night. This dish was won-derful. Served over coleslaw with a lemon 
grass topping, it was the best part of the meal. 
The lemon grass flavor was just right — not too overpowering.
To end the night, we had an order of fried 
ice cream. This was vanilla ice cream served in a warm pastry cup topped with raspberries 
and black cherries. Not only do the tart berries 
present a nice contrast to the sweet ice cream and pastry, the hot of the pastry and cold of the ice cream contrast nicely as well. Perhaps another scoop of vanilla ice cream would have created a more perfect balance.   
Dragonfly would not be my first choice 
for dinner. If a group of people were going, I would go along. The food was OK, at best. The 
staff was friendly but clearly rushed due to the 
large crowd. This is not a cheap date kind of place.

SweetBerries is a welcome, sugar-
coated breath of sweet air to the auto 
shops and local hopeful eateries on 13th Street. The green, antique-look-ing seats and brown, wooden tables 
decorating the small custard shop 
appeared to have been plucked out of a quaint, vintage furniture store. Even the cafeteria-style ordering system at the register was quaint.
At first glance of the menu, spe-
cially created for Gainesville Res-
taurant Week, the cashier hesitated 
when asked what constitutes the SweetBerries Sunset concrete, which seemed odd considering she didn’t fail to mention it is one of the most popular flavors at the shop. But she let me try the chicken salad before ordering. And I was given the choice to have my custard dessert brought 
to me after I finished my meal — not 
underappreciated.
My $10 tray of food was cheerful-
ly brought to me about 5 minutes af-ter I ordered; my friends’ food took 15 minutes. The chicken salad sand-wich looked delicately assembled, 
but one bite of the fluffy croissant 
flattened it into flaky, bland nothing. It was almost as if the taste escaped my tongue after a few seconds. 
The mediocre chicken salad and 
limp lettuce became less appetizing with each bite. It needed the crunch of fresh grapes and more chewi-ness that only raisins could provide. 
With the downtown green market 
in such close proximity, I would have thought at least the fruit salad would be fresher.However, the chocolate chips 
and generously sized Reese’s bites lodged in the silky folds of the bed 
— or should I say mountain — of 
chocolate custard would have been a meal in itself.  Even upon arrival, I figured the Chocoholic concrete was a safe bet for dessert — if there’s one thing on a menu that should excel it would probably involve chocolate. 
The staff was very accommodat-
ing and kind, coming to check on 
us multiple times in the hour we 
stayed.
Despite my eating companion 
commenting on how cute a study spot the photograph-splashed shop might be “if it wasn’t so loud,” it wouldn’t be my ideal lunch spot. 
But this is the only place for custard 
in Gainesville, and it’s delicious. Supply and demand, my satiated friends.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
I can’t stop thinking about 
boning this hot guy. I have 
bigger issues to deal with and need to put it out of my head. 
How can I do this?
Dear Friend,
Masturbate until your fin -
gers look like you’ve been in a bath for too long or until they never smell the same.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’m gay and I want to be able to kiss 
my boyfriend in public — or at least in 
front of our other friends — but we both 
feel a little weird about it. Any advice?
Dear Friend,
You may not be into PDA, which is fine, but make sure that 
your lack of affection in public is not because of what others think. If you’re worried about some a-hole’s insignificant and most likely ignorant opinion, just don’t worry about it. You’re in a relationship with a person you legitimately give a s—t about. Everyone that isn’t you or your boyfriend can go eat a bag of dildos. Do whatever PDA you want with your boyfriend, but do not have sex in public because if you get caught, you will probably be put on the sex offender registry.Dear Mediocre Advice,
Since it’s possible to break out of friend 
zones, is it possible to break out of zones like “Jewish girls who will only date Jewish guys” or 
“white girls who will only date black guys”?
Dear Friend,
Yes, it is possible to break out of these zones and 
Ryan Gosling is living proof. There is no one on this earth that wouldn’t go on a date with that face and those abs. Having a type is just a personal preference. If someone has found their type to be Jewish guys or black guys,  you can’t be mad at that person for not wanting to go out with you. Don’t take this rejection personal. It would probably be a waste of both of your time, anyway. The heart wants 
what it wants, and sometimes it just wants a Jewish guy.OLIVIA LANGDON

Only a handful of people 
showed up for Ed Buckley’s ﬁ  t-ness class.
As a group ﬁ  tness instructor 
at Gainesville Health and Fitness Center, he jotted down the exer-cises that he used in class on a whiteboard displayed outside of the room, hoping to catch the cu-riosity of gym wanderers.
This minor ploy was the tip-
ping point, doubling the class size in two weeks. Curious as to why, 
Buckley asked his new pupils 
what had attracted them.
Once people read what to ex-
pect, they felt more comfortable trying something new, he said.
This idea of connecting people 
through ﬁ  tness and digitally in-tegrating it into people’s lives spurred the creation of peerFit in 2011.
Buckley and three friends — 
all University of Florida gradu-ate students — developed a free iPhone app and mobile website, 
that aims to “to make group 
ﬁ  tness accessible,” peerFit co-founder and senior vice president Scott Peeples said.
In its initial phase, the 20-
something-year-olds reached out to universities across the coun-try, cold calling gym after gym. Northern Arizona University and 
only a few others were on board.
On June 5, peerFit partnered 
with MINDBODY, “the largest 
cloud-based software provider in the health, wellness and beau-ty industries,” according to its website. This connected the local business with a database of over 25,000 gyms throughout the U.S., ofﬁ  cially launching the app na-tionwide.
MINDBODY works directly 
with the gyms, allowing members to sign up for classes, and part-ners with companies like peerFit 
to promote the gyms’ classes with 
a searchable database and user reviews.
PeerFit now has the ability to 
connect directly with gym-goers in any given area and app-users throughout the country.
Matt Redinger, co-founder and 
vice president of operations and 
ﬁ  nance, said many gyms have yet 
to catch up to the “digital promo-tions” of ﬁ  tness- and health-relat-ed activities.
PeerFit also contacts gyms di-
rectly, in order to share this tech-nology.
The next step for peerFit is to 
ﬁ  nd people who love group ﬁ  t-ness classes to download the app, input content and add their re-views to help others.
“We want to target not only 
people who already work out, but also those who want to work 
out but just don’t know where to 
start,” Redinger said.
PeerFit’s user reviews will pro-
vide insight for the newcomers. It will soon allow users to invite their friends to go to classes with them, he said.
When deciding on which class 
to choose, a group ﬁ  tness class 
ﬁ  rst-timer may wonder what 
exercise gadgets they’ll need to bring with them or how intense the class is on a scale of yoga to CrossFit. The peerFit app becomes your virtual gym buddy with all these answers connected through Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to make it more accessible.UF journalism junior and peer-
Fit blogger Samantha Black, 20, has never tried a group ﬁ  tness class until now.
Interning with peerFit has 
made group ﬁ  tness more interest-
ing to her and has pushed her to 
try a class, Black said. She now goes to iBurn and yoga every week at Southwest Recreation Center.
“People need to try group ﬁ  t-
ness because it’s going to push them to go faster, to go longer and to do things that they prob-
ably wouldn’t think to do on their 
own,” Black said.  
PeerFit plans to build a system 
around users’ goals and it will recommend the class that best suits the user.
“We are trying to be the most 
complete booking service that’s out there,” Buckley said.

When I first made the deci-
sion to fast for Ramadan, I did so 
to foster a sense of camaraderie 
with my students. In my mind 
— foolish and well-intentioned as it is — I had assumed that as I entered class each day, those of 
us who were fasting would smile 
and nod knowingly to each other as though we were part of some secret.
The Muslim students were al-
ways especially gracious in their support of my fasting, telling me stories and offering advice on how to best cope with the hun-
ger and dehydration as I waffled 
through the preceding weeks. But there were two hugely important things I had not accounted for: 1) that fasting, if you’ve never done 
it before, is very, very hard; and 
2) that in my ignorance, I had en-tirely missed the point of what I was doing.
For more on the first point, 
fasting with practiced Muslims because you’re worried about their attentiveness in class is like deciding to box with Muhammad 
Ali because he stubbed his toe. By 
the third day of fasting, my Mus-lim students had adjusted to their new eating and sleeping sched-ule and were showing up to class lively and bright-eyed as ever. I, 
on the other hand, possessed the 
Ramadan-ready aptitude of a tree frog.
More than anything, fasting 
punctuated my sleep schedule. 
Waiting every day for Iftar, or my 
evening meal after the sun had set, was, for me, torture. I would arrive home around 6 p.m., dehy-
drated, starving and exhausted 
(fat American that I am). Often the only way I could make it to 8:30 p.m. was by going to sleep. 
When my alarm clock/dinner 
bell sounded clangorously next to my thick skull, I would wake dry-mouthed and bewildered at the sudden absence of light in my 
apartment. Once I remembered 
where I was, I would run to the kitchen sink and pour myself sev-eral large glasses of water, where I would drink them with soap 
opera-inspired theatrics.
But even worse than wait-
ing for Iftar was waking up for 
Suhoor, my predawn meal. Af-
ter stuffing myself to painful 
proportions only a few hours earlier, my alarm would go off again, too soon, and I would run to the kitchen and eat as large a 
bowl of cereal as I could, guzzle two to three glasses of water and 
then jump back into bed and try to fall back asleep before I had to 
pee — a consequence of the new 
sport I’d deemed “survivor chug-ging.” This practice ultimately led to me missing several morning classes, which forced me to think 
about the excuse I would need to 
present to my professor: “Sorry I missed class, sir; I was pseudo guest-practicing the Islamic Holy 
Month.”
One day, 
during a par-
ticularly rough class, my stu-
dents asked 
how my fasting was going. “Oh, it sucks,” I said, 
jokingly. “Why are we doing this again?”
“We are doing this to show our 
God that we love him,” one of my students said very patiently, but 
also very seriously. At this point 
I truly recognized my position as a spectator during their holy month. With no God of my own to 
deliver me from certain palatable 
temptations, I was at the mercy of myself.
“It’s not just about not eating 
or drinking,” another one of my 
students added. “We are cleans-ing ourselves. You can’t swear or 
listen to music.”
“You can’t dance, either!” 
added another. And sex, I learned — even with your spouse — was totally out of the question. One student even approached me af-ter class and said, “And don’t 
forget, you can’t even . . . ” and 
then made a lurid hand gesture. So I guessed that was out of the question, too.
As I progressed (and continue 
to progress through the experi-ence), I began to understand the importance of God in observing fasting. During my second week 
observing, I cheated on my fast-
ing. One Friday I’d become so concerned with my gaunt frame and paunch belly (with my new 
eating and sleeping schedule find-
ing time to exercise proved impos-sible), I joined friends for Krishna Lunch. Now, while I doubt the Krishna House would appreciate 
being likened to a brothel, being 
there made me feel adulterous. 
Eating and drinking while 
knowing how hungry and thirsty 
my students were made me feel 
like I was cheating on a spouse. My students had committed to something so much larger than themselves, something profound 
and holy, whereas I had been brought down by something as 
small and insignificant as my body and my own petty vanity.
Until I learned that if you 
broke fast you could make it up after Ramadan.
“God doesn’t want you to suf-
fer,” one of my students said, 
laughing. “But he does want you 
to understand how less fortunate people feel.” This kind of commit-ment to religion was something 
new to me, and when one student 
told me the number of times a day he prayed (five), I replied, with crystalline perspicaciousness, “Dang, that’s a lot of prayers!” To 
which he laughed and said, “It’s 
about being close to your God. I like being close with my God.”
As I continue to count down 
the days until I can eat food dur-ing the day again, I am at least grateful for the small amount of understanding I have gained. Fasting has helped me under-
stand the strength faith can give 
to a person’s resolve, especially since, as a non-theist, I struggle so much more to abstain from food 
and drink having no higher pow-
er to honor. The only reason I’ve been able to keep up my fast is so I can say to my students, with a straight face, “Don’t worry; I 
know exactly how you feel.”

I walk through Death or Glory Tattoo Par-
lour’s front door that faces out toward North 
Sixth Street.  I’m greeted by a glass casing that contains several shelves meticulously loaded with a variety of bric-a-brac. Unknown to my-
self, this is the shop’s shrine, a monument to 
the lives of its workers and the art of tattoo-ing. 
The owner, Little Mike, a rough-and-tum-
ble looking man decked out in tattoos and a plain T-shirt, invites me into the back. He talks in a relaxed baritone with a slight rasp.
Who all works here?
“It’s me and Rob. Then there’s Nick Hall 
over there and Lee Miles.”
How long have you been open for?
“We’ve been open for two years. We all 
started at BODYTECH, then some of us left and opened Anthem about six years ago. I kept butting heads with another dude who worked there, so I decided I wanted to do my 
own thing. I had a speciﬁ  c way I wanted to run 
a shop and I wanted to be able to make that an actuality. I moved down to Ocala to work for about six months, but I still had a bunch of 
tattoos ﬂ  oating around Gainesville — things I 
wanted to ﬁ  nish up. There was a huge ﬂ  ood of people coming down there to get work done by me. So a friend told me I’d be a moron to leave that type of clientele.”
I was going to ask, ‘why Gainesville?’ but I 
guess that answers it.
“Yeah, I moved here when I was around 17 
or 18 to go to art school. Soon as I got here I was hanging out at tattoo shops. That’s when I got the bug. I was already crazy about getting tattoos. Got my ﬁ  rst tattoo when I was 14 by some bikers in a living room.”
It seems apprenticeships are a big part of becom-
ing a tattoo artist. Was that the case for you?
“I never really ofﬁ  cially apprenticed, but I 
learned under my friend Danny and was off and on doing tattoos, working other odd jobs often until I was about 27.”
Is that the case for most tattoo artists? They 
have some kind of background of sketching a lot or going to art school?
“It deﬁ  nitely helps. Tattooing is two-tiered. 
There’s a mechanical aspect — putting ink 
into skin. Then there’s the art side of it — the 
actual drawing part. If you’re good mechani-cally, you can still tattoo. You know, trace the lines and put ink into skin. That aspect is very 
straightforward.”
What makes Death or Glory different from other 
tattoo places?
“We’re way more involved in the tattoo 
world. We’re constantly striving to get bet-
ter, doing guest spots and having other artists come in. We hold ourselves to a higher level, for sure, than most shops in town. It was sh--ty 
— the whole Anthem ordeal. Watching some-
thing you built with your own two hands — something you consider your baby — get messed up.”
How is tattooing differ-
ent from other art forms?
“The craft of putting 
ink into skin is pretty 
rare. Really at the end of 
the day, it’s a folk art. It’s not high-end gallery stuff. I don’t think of it that way.”
What’s one style that you try and emulate?“I think that American traditional really 
encompasses all the rules that you should fol-
low. I love all different styles though: black 
and gray when it’s done right, traditional Japanese stuff. But American traditional is re-ally designed to be a tattoo. Death or Glory is a 
traditional design based off a war medal.”
What would you say to someone who is on the 
fence about getting a tattoo?
“I don’t ever try and push anything on 
anybody. If they’re indecisive, this is the last 
place in the world to be. Really, just make sure who you go to, and look at portfolios and don’t worry about money. That’s the worst 
thing you can do because you’re going to end 
up with somebody who doesn’t know what they’re doing. “
You tattoo each other ever?“All the time. Nick just did a big tattoo on 
my foot. I just did a piece on Rob. And Rob just worked on Nick.”
How do you view this store and your co-work-
ers?
“It’s total family. We eat together, we spend 
time together, our holidays are spent together. There’s also a really tight-knit group of friends who were once clients who are now really close with us also.”
What about future plans for Death or Glory?
“I don’t know. I love what’s going on right 
now. I just want it to at least stay this way.” Death or Glory Tattoo Parlour product of joint desire to improve

Swimmer wins silver
UF swimmer Connor Dwyer earned his first career individual World 
Championship medal on Tuesday at the FINA World Aquatic Championships in Barcelona, Spain. Dwyer finished second in the 200-meter freestyle.
Recruits coming to visit
Five-star power forward Leron Black and four-star point 
guard Chris Chiozza are visiting UF today. Black remains uncommitted; Chiozza committed to Florida in May.The Tampa Bay Rays’ pitcher Matt Moore is sidelined with a sore left elbow. Read the story on page 16.� DRISKEL IS EXPECTED TO PRACTICE IN 
TWO WEEKS.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN and LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writers
Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel underwent 
appendectomy surgery on Tuesday, the team an-
nounced Tuesday.
Coach Will Muschamp said the amount of 
time Driskel will miss will be based on how he recovers from the surgery, which he said could be up to about two weeks.
“Jeff had acute appendicitis and fortunately 
the medical staff caught it very quickly,” Mus-champ said in a press release.
Driskel is expected to start at quarterback this 
season. Last year, he threw for 1,646 yards and 
12 touchdowns while tossing five interceptions. 
Driskel also ran for more than 400 yards.
The Gators begin fall training camp on Friday. 
Driskel could return before Aug. 15 – the first of 
the Gators’ four fall practices open to the public.
Other quarterbacks on Florida’s roster in-
clude junior Tyler Murphy and redshirt fresh-
man Skyler Mornhinweg. Neither have thrown an in-game pass for the Gators.
Cooper says slur: On Wednesday, Crossing-
Broad.com released a video of former Gators and current Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver 
Riley Cooper using a racial slur during a Kenny 
Chesney concert on June 8 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.
“I will jump that fence and fight every n----r here,” Cooper says in the 20-second clip.
Less than an hour after Deadspin published 
a story featuring the video, Cooper apologized for his actions via his Twitter account (@Riley-Cooper_14).
“I am so ashamed and disgusted with my-
self,” Cooper wrote. “I want to apologize. I have been offensive. I have apologized to my coach, (Philadelphia Eagles owner) Jeffrey Lurie, and 
(general manager) Howie Roseman and to my 
teammates. I owe an apology to the fans and to this community. I am so ashamed, but there are no excuses. What I did was wrong and I will ac-cept the consequences.”
Cooper held a press conference on Wednes-
day night and said he was drinking at the con-cert. He also said the team fined him “a good amount of money.”
With Jeremy Maclin sidelined for the year 
with an ACL tear, Cooper is expected to be the Eagles’ No. 2 receiver this season. 
Leak joins offensive staff: Two months after 
joining the Florida coaching staff as a quality con-
trol coach, former Gators quarterback Chris Leak 
was named a graduate assistant on Wednesday.
Leak was Florida’s starting quarterback from 
2003 to 2006. He is the all-time leader in quarter-
back starts (47) and passing yards (11,213).
Leak won the national title game MVP after 
Florida defeated Ohio State 41-14 in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game.

After the Florida women’s 
tennis team lost Lauren Embree 
and Caroline Hitimana to gradu-
ation, three freshmen have signed to complete the team. 
Stefani Stojic and Belinda 
Woolcock signed their National Letters of Intent this week to add 
to the Gators’ roster.
Stojic won the Sydney Interna-
tional singles and doubles com-petitions in 2010. The 18-year-old 
grabbed more accolades that sea-son, winning the NSW Junior ITF 
International singles and doubles 
competitions.
Stojic also competed in the 
Australian Open Junior Champi-onships and joins the Gators after finishing her juniors career 21-13 
in singles and 19-15 in doubles.Woolcock, 18, comes to Flor-
ida after advancing to the quar-
terfinals in the Las Cruces $25K 
Women’s Challenger in New 
Mexico back in June. Woolcock 
advanced to the Round of 16 in 
the Las Cruces singles competi-
tion before dropping her match 
6-1, 1-6, 6-3 to second-seeded, top-300 player Petra Rampa.
Woolcock finished her juniors 
career with a 31-24 singles record and a 27-22 record in doubles.
“We are thrilled with the ad-
dition of Stefani and Belinda,” Thornqvist said.
“They are incredibly athletic 
and will also provide an immedi-ate help in our doubles lineup.”
Kourtney Keegan, a Roswell, 
Ga., native, signed her National 
Letter of Intent with the Gators 
back in November.
Keegan, Georgia’s top-ranked 
tennis player and No. 8 recruit in the country, according to Ten-nis Recruiting Network, finished 
her high school career at Blessed 
Trinity with a 50-0 record and two consecutive high school 
titles.  
“Kourtney will be a leader 
in the locker room,” Thornqvist said. “I think the world of her 
on and off the court. She’s smart, she likes to play and she’s a good 
character person.”
The newcomers join sopho-
more Brianna Morgan and se-niors Sofie Oyen, Alexandra Cer-
cone and Olivia Janowicz for the 2013-2014 season.Florida brings in three recruits
“We are thrilled with 
the addition of Stefani and 
Belinda,”

UF coachthe Allig Ator A wArds
Adam: UF had a lot of good teams 
this past year, and good teams tend to play good games. But few games meant as much to any pro-gram as Florida’s win over LSU last October.
To understand why the win 
was so important, you only need to look at the last couple seasons. 
A 15-11 record over the last 
two seasons put the football pro-gram in a funk, and it needed something to snap out of it. 
Yeah, the Gators won their 
first four games, but that didn’t mean too much. UF beat Bowl-ing Green (I’ll wait for you to re-member that game), a pre-Johnny Football Texas A&M, Tennessee and Kentucky. I think those last two speak for themselves.
UF needed a statement win to 
let everyone know that Florida football was back, and the LSU win did it. 
Landon: LSU-Florida was an entertaining, grind-it-out battle with plenty of implications, but it wasn’t even the best college foot-ball game that day.
On Oct. 6, some crazy stuff 
went down on the national land-scape. North Carolina State upset then-No. 3 Florida State 17-16 on a touchdown pass with 16 sec-onds remaining, Stanford defeat-ed Arizona 54-48 in overtime on a 21-yard touchdown run from Cardinal halfback Stepfan Tay-lor and West Virginia and Texas combined for 93 points in a back-and-forth affair.
But we’re debating the best 
Florida game of 2012-13, so I have to go with UF softball’s 9-8 victory against Nebraska in the Women’s College World Series that spanned about five and a 
Best game of 2012-13?
 
see rAll Y, PA ge 20half hours over 15 innings and 
helped the Gators stave off elimi-
nation. The win was as much of a 
statement for coach Tim Walton’s group as UF’s win against LSU was for the football program.
  The game had the home runs, 
the big plays – everything a fan could ask for. 
What was expected to be a 
ﬁ  ller game on ESPN’s schedule 
transformed into an epic con-
test that pushed back America’s 
beloved late-night SportsCenter segment and prevented our soft-ball beat writer – yours truly – 
from checking out Midtown the 
night of June 1.
Adam: Although Florida’s win 
over Nebraska was certainly 
thrilling, it didn’t have the same 
ramiﬁ  cations as football’s win 
against LSU.
  Yeah, it advanced the Gators 
one win deeper into the WCWS, 
but they didn’t win the title. In 
fact, the team fell ﬂ  at the next 
day – Texas shut them out about 12 hours later.
  Now I’m sure the team was 
tired from the game the night be-
fore, but it kind of puts a damper 
on that exhilarating win.
  Meanwhile, UF-LSU set the 
tone for the rest of the year. That win gave Florida 
the momentum it needed to travel to Nashville,  Tenn., beat an upstart Van-
derbilt team, then come 
back home and obliterate 
a top-10 Gamecocks squad in The Swamp.
  Remember, the Tigers 
were undefeated before 
playing the Gators. These were 
the same Tigers who had played in the national title game nine months prior.
  And Florida had everything to 
prove. 
  Running back Mike Gillislee 
needed to prove he could run against a good defense, and he did.
  The defense needed to show it 
could stop a highly ranked team, and it did.
  Without beating LSU last year, 
Florida probably ends up on or two games worse, playing in the Capital One Bowl instead of the Sugar Bowl. 
Landon: Both contests were es-
sentially elimination games, so 
I’ll go ahead and refute that they had equal implications. Of course, UF football’s win against LSU 
meant more to the Gators’ foot-
ball-centric fan base, but Florida 
softball’s overtime win was way more exciting and added an ele-ment of surprise the football vic-
tory lacked.
  Who would have ever thought that Katie Medina and Jes-
sica Damico would make SportsCenter Top-10 worthy diving catches? That Briana 
Little, Florida’s No. 8 hit-
ter, and Nebraska’s Taylor 
Edwards would exchange homers in the 10th inning? That freshman catcher Tay-
lore Fuller would provide 
the game-winning play to score 
Lauren Haeger and Damico in the top of the 15th? That Haeger would experience the postgame moment she wanted so badly her entire life?
  Sure, the Gators experienced a 
hangover the next day against the Longhorns, but I don’t think it put that much of a damper on the victory. Everybody understood Walton’s squad was exhausted. Besides, there was no way any team was getting past Oklahoma in 2013.  Florida-Nebraska carried that 
original and unpredictable aura that makes us love sports. I’ve seen the football team win big 
games before.
Adam: You saw them win big 
games … later in the 2012 season. Since you’ve been at UF, they’ve 
lost every “big” game (unless you 
consider rivalry games against a 
bad Tennessee team “big”). 
  Every game is unpredictable. 
Who would’ve thought Matt Elam would knock a 56-yard pass out of Odell Beckham’s hands?
  The win against LSU was a 
program-deﬁ  ning victory that will carry momentum into this upcoming season.

TAMPA BAY RAYS
  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
  
  ST. PETERSBURG (AP) — Matt 
Moore’s changeup has caused a lot 
of trouble for hitters this season.
  Now it’s even a problem for 
Moore, Tampa Bay’s All-Star pitcher 
who was put on the 15-day disabled 
list Wednesday with a sore left el-bow.
  Moore will miss one or two starts. The Rays are calling the move 
precautionary.
  Moore is 14-3 with a 3.41 ERA in 
21 starts. The Rays made the move 
while leading the AL East, and called up inﬁ  elder Ryan Roberts from Triple-A Durham.
  “If this was the playoffs or some 
situation that called for me to be out there, I think without doubt 
that I could do it,” Moore said. “But 
there’s just no reason for us to push things right now.”
  Moore left Sunday’s start against 
the New York Yankees after just ﬁ  ve innings.
  “I think the second inning is 
when I started to feel it. But only on changeups, which is part of the rea-son why I stayed in at the game as long as I did, just mostly with fast-balls and curveballs,” he said.
  Said Maddon: “That’ll happen 
where guys will get sore on a certain pitch, and then if they don’t throw it 
they stop being sore.”
  “But the changeup’s a big pitch 
for him, so we wanted him to get 
that back,” he said.
  The 24-year-old left-hander is 
tied for second in the American League in wins and winning per-centage (.824) and third in opposing batting average (.212).
  “Anytime you’re dealing with 
a pitcher and his arm, you’re going to have some degree of concern, but 
everyone feels really good about it. 
So does Matt,” Rays executive vice president of baseball operations An-drew Friedman said.
  “We’re being overly cautious 
right now. The (upcoming) off-days afford us an opportunity to do that, and we’re going to make sure that he’s 100 percent healthy when we 
put him back out there,” he said.
