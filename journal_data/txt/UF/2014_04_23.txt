A UF student alleges that a case she 
and her parents were involved in was 
mishandled, and she’s turned to You-Tube to tell her story.
Hope Stevens, a UF agricultural op-
erations management freshman, post-ed a video Tuesday night regarding an incident that happened at her family’s home April 4. In the video ﬁ  lmed from her Buckman dorm room, she said her case was minimized by the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce because her father, Todd Stevens, is an ofﬁ  cer with the force.
Stevens, 19, said it all started when 
she went to her parents’ home in the 400 block of Southwest 117th Street. They were meeting to talk about school. She told her parents that classes weren’t going well, and maybe UF wasn’t the path for her. 
In the video, she chokes up and be-
gins sobbing as she tells her story.
Stevens said her parents told her 
she needed to talk to a counselor, and she agreed. But she realized her par-ents wouldn’t let her go back to her dorm room. She said she felt trapped and wanted to leave. After calling a friend to pick her up and walking toward the door, Stevens said 
her father grabbed her wrist, took her phone and yelled, “No, you’re not go-ing anywhere.”
Her mother called 911 and told dis-
patch that her daughter was suicidal. 
Her mom stood in the way, and 
Stevens tried to get around her. That’s

Noel Thomas hasn’t seen his family since Christmas 
Day. Before that, June.
Instead, the 20-year-old UF mechanical engineering 
junior dedicates his free time preparing for Formula SAE 
Michigan, part of an annual competition series in which 120 collegiate automotive engineering teams showcase a single-seat, formula-style race car made from scratch at the Michigan International Speedway starting May 14.
“There’s honestly nothing else like this program that 
gives that kind of experience,” said Thomas, UF Society of Automotive Engineers co-captain.
Only about 20 of the most dedicated members of the 
team, nicknamed Gator Motorsports, will make the 17-hour drive to Brooklyn, Mich., on May 5 to test the 430-pound race car they sacriﬁ  ce sleep, school and social en-gagements for. It’ll be unveiled 5:30 p.m. Friday at the New Engineering Building Rotunda. 
The competitors’ goal is to design, create and test a car 
for a ﬁ  ctional manufacturing company. Automotive indus-try volunteers will judge prototypes in areas like accelera-tion, fuel efﬁ  ciency, design and endurance.
Team member Sean Niemi, a 26-year-old UF mechani-
cal engineering graduate student, said the competition is like rolling dice.
“All it takes is one loose stud, and your car won’t start 
back up again,” he said, “and that could make or break your competition.”
About 50 UF students have been shufﬂ  ing through the 
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Design and Man-ufacturing Lab since last year’s competition.
“It’s nonstop,” Thomas said.Although the race car has been functional since the start 
of Spring Break, Thomas said the team has been working out kinks and applying ﬁ  nishing touches. The failure rate during the competition is about 50 percent, he said, so the team prioritizes testing while there is still room for error. 
Thomas isn’t worried, though. The team settled on a 
plan two years ago: First, they aimed to place in the top 20. Check. The following year’s goal was top 10. Done. Now, they’re hoping to place among the top ﬁ  ve. Promising.UF engineering

In light of a series of thefts on 
campus, University Police is advis-
ing students to keep an eye on their belongings as ﬁ  nals approach. 
Electronic devices such as lap-
tops, tablets and cellphones are be-ing targeted, UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber said. Ofﬁ  cers ﬁ  rst no-ticed the series in March, but UPD has no suspects at this point.
“These thefts have predominant-
ly been thefts of opportunity with individuals who have left personal belongings unattended,” he said. 
Several on-campus buildings 
have been affected, including Mar-ston Science Library, the Computer Science Engineering Building and Library West. 
UF history senior Skye Schmelzer said she’s at Library West every day and never heard about the thefts. The 21-year-old said she’s always with a friend or asks someone to watch her stuff. 
UPD released a safety notice re-
garding the thefts on its Facebook page Tuesday afternoon. The de-partment advises students to regis-ter their electronic devices with the department. Also, the post recom-mended installing a Front Door lap-top security system to help disable a laptop if it is stolen, the release states. 
UPD encourages everyone to re-
port suspicious persons or activity by calling 352-392-1111.

Bieber seeks delay in DUI trial 
MIAMI — Justin Bieber is 
seeking a delay in his trial cur-
rently scheduled to begin next month on Florida charges of driv-ing under the inﬂ  uence, resisting arrest and driving with an ex-pired license.
The 20-year-old pop singer’s 
lawyers ﬁ  led a motion Monday saying they need more time to prepare their case. Bieber’s trial is set for May 5 in Miami.
The motion says prosecutors 
do not oppose a delay. A schedul-ing hearing is set for Wednesday.
Bieber was arrested Jan. 23 in 
Miami Beach after what police described as an illegal street drag race. He wasn’t charged with drag racing.
Alcohol breath tests found 
Bieber’s level below the 0.02 limit for underage drivers. Urine tests showed the presence of marijua-na and an anti-anxiety drug in his system.

when, she said, her father kneed her in the 
back and slammed her head into the door and wall. She said she passed out.
When an officer responded, she said he 
had her sit in the back of the patrol car for about a half an hour while he talked to her parents inside. Then he drove her to the end of the neighborhood to meet an ambulance. She said medical help should have been called im-mediately instead. But the official ASO incident report paints 
a different picture.
The ASO officer who responded to the call 
wrote that “no battery occurred. Todd only re-strained Hope because he believed she would hurt herself if he didn’t keep her inside,” ac-cording to the report.
When he let go, “she hesitated before pur-
posely dropping herself on the ground and bumping her head on the tile. Hope laid on the ground silently initially in an attempt to ap-pear that she was unconscious. When I called her bluff, Hope opened her eyes and began crying loudly again.”
The case is being handled as a domestic dis-
turbance, not domestic violence. ASO spokes-man Art Forgey explained the difference lies in whether a crime occurred. Domestic vio-lence incidents usually involve an arrest.
For a domestic disturbance, “typically they 
try to restore the peace, provide whatever ser-vices are necessary and move on. Each distur-bance is going to be different. This is the out-come the deputy deemed to be the best course of action,” Forgey said.
Todd Stevens, a reserve deputy who was 
hired by ASO in November and is still in train-ing, declined to comment. 
Her mother declined to comment as well.Hope said she still thinks the handling of 
the case was unjust.
“My dad isn’t being charged for grabbing 
me inappropriately,” she said. 
Forgey said Stevens filed a complaint with 
ASO’s Office of Professionalism on Tuesday, and it will be investigated.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 23, 2014

Gainesville Police began an investigation Friday to deter-
mine if the department had any involvement gathering infor-
mation to quash a warrant for the arrest of former UF football player Loucheiz Purifoy. 
On March 18, Alachua County Sheriff’s deputies command-
ed the arrest of the 21-year-old on charges of marijuana pos-session and synthetic narcotic possession, according to an ASO warrant affidavit.
At about 11:30 p.m., a deputy on foot patrol confronted Pu-rifoy because marijuana smoke was coming out of the car he was in. When the deputy approached Purifoy, who was in the driver’s seat, Purifoy was holding a blunt, according to the warrant.
A search of the car revealed two bags 
with about 0.7 grams of bath salts, accord-ing to the warrant. During questioning, Pu-rifoy told officers he thought he had bought molly.
Purifoy made a motion to quash the warrant April 16, giv-ing the following reasons:
He stated he retained counsel, has no prior significant histo-
ry and has no prior instances of failing to appear to court dates. In addition, Purifoy said he will make himself available to law enforcement and will waive his right to a speedy trial. 
Chief Assistant State Attorney Jeanne Singer was consulted 
about the motion and did not object, according to court docu-ments. The arrest warrant was canceled the next day. 
Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said Sher-
iff Sadie Darnell reached out to GPD Chief Tony Jones to look into the matter. UF football player Purifoy’s law run-in sparks GPD investigation

ZACHARY PETERSON
Alligator Contributing Writer 
He’d said his morning prayers, 
assembled his plastic cross. He’d 
staked out his usual spot near the bus stop. He’d been spit at, and it wasn’t even noon.
Now, it was time for salvation. A bell rang. Students flooded 
out of classrooms, filling UF's Tur-lington Plaza. Junior Lofton, 73, gripped his cross and shuffled into the crowd.
“Friends!” he shouted. “There’s 
two roads: one to Heaven, one to Hell. Which one are you on?”
“I’m on both,” one man joked, 
walking away.
Junior wiped sweat from his 
brow.
For 32 years, the preacher says, 
he’s been pointing students to Christ because he wants them to avoid a path that nearly ruined his life. 
“How about you?” Junior asked 
another student. “Are you born again?”
“I got class, man.”Junior turned to someone else. 
“What about you, young lady?”
No reply.“What if you died before class 
started?” he called to no one in par-ticular.
“Then I won’t have to pay my 
rent!” someone yelled back.
■      ■       ■
Street preaching isn’t easy. In January, a visiting preacher 
walked onto Turlington Plaza and screamed for three hours. One stu-dent stood next to him holding a sign that read: “NOT A CHRIS-TIAN, JUST A DICK.”
In February, another preacher 
roared near the classrooms. A 26-year-old student slapped him in the face. 
Three days a week, Junior shuf-
fles through the plaza.
He smiles but never takes no for 
an answer. He hands out business cards that say “Jesus Saves.” He compares anything red to a commu-nist — except his Bible. He reveres Republican politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan: “Good, decent people you can trust.” He believes no human is born to be a homosexual.
“I’m not trying to win a popular-
ity contest,” he shrugged. 
■      ■       ■
When Junior was 3, his father, 
James, died from pneumonia, leav-ing behind a wife and five children.
The family squeezed into a three-
bedroom place in east Gainesville. The children slept on pasteboard boxes or huddled in two quilts. There was no air conditioning. You stood on the porch if “you wanted to catch a breeze.” 
To support her family, Ethel Lof-
ton worked seven days a week at restaurants, diners, a nearby mili-tary camp during World War II. She picked oranges and sold the juice in one-gallon bottles on campus. Cut. Flip. Squeeze. Repeat. 
With his mother busy, Junior 
found trouble. 
At 13, he took his first drink from 
a jug of moonshine. By 16, he was ad-dicted to alcohol. Because Alachua was a dry county during the 1950s, Junior said he and his friends spent their days learning where bootleg-gers dropped off moonshine, then stole from them at night.
During high school, his thoughts 
turned to conquests: “How many women could I sleep with?” 
Instead of college, Junior did roof 
tiling. In the evenings, he’d cruise around with buddies in sports cars, searching for pretty girls and drink-ing homebrew. 
Soon, Junior earned a reputation 
for boozing and womanizing. But alone, he wept.
In his 20s, Junior suffered from 
night terrors. He woke up panting, sweating through the sheets. 
Eventually, he sought help for 
his drinking. From family to friends, the advice never changed: “You just quit.” 
■      ■       ■
It’s early morning on Turlington 
Plaza. 
Junior leans on his cross. A short 
woman with thick, black hair stands next to him — his wife, Debbie, 60. 
The couple met more than 40 
years ago. 
Junior was teaching an adult Bi-
ble-studies class at Windsor Baptist Church, about 20 minutes outside Gainesville. Debbie Nobles was one of his students. She was 14. 
When Junior first saw her, he 
thought she was beautiful — and the thought spooked him. After class, he hopped in his pickup and prayed while speeding home. 
Two years later, Junior and Deb-
bie started dating. 
They biked around the city of 
Windsor and fished on weekends.Her parents were uncomfortable. Junior was going on 30, and Debbie wasn’t legally an adult. “But they saw that we were serious,” Debbie recalled, “and did finally give us their blessing.”  
A few months later, they married 
June 21, 1970, beneath a giant oak tree in Windsor. Debbie was 16. 
They raised four children over 
nearly 44 years: Delbert, 50; Tamara, 40; Lance, 35; and Pamela, 31.
Debbie thinks her husband is 
misunderstood.  
“He’s here preaching because 
he loves people so much,” she said. “We’re not the kind of people who force religion.”
■      ■       ■
The day Junior came to Christ, he 
didn’t know a single Bible verse. It was April 1967, and he was lying in bed after a night of heavy drinking.
Sunlight leaked through the 
blinds. The 27-year-old slowly opened his eyes but couldn’t sit up for fear of getting sick. 
His clock radio buzzed, and a 
preacher’s voice filled the room.
“Jesus can give you peace. If you 
don’t have peace, he can give it to you...”
Junior groaned. Too much noise. He groped for the off button, 
but when he tried to sit up, his skull throbbed. 
The voice talked about two 
roads in life — the broad and nar-row. “Where are you heading?” the preacher asked. 
Junior didn’t try to pretend. 
Nights were spent on booze and women. Days were spent recover-ing. He had recently split with his first wife and was learning to care for Delbert, their son.
When a lover crawled into bed 
and started whispering in Junior’s ear, the realization washed over him. He wanted a pure life with Je-sus.
He told her about his desire for 
transformation, but she just glared, tears forming in her huckleberry-blue eyes.
“Your friends told me you would 
do this,” she said. “They told me you would leave me.”
For two hours, Junior sat still 
at the foot of the bed, cradling his head. 
Then he walked into the shower 
and scrubbed himself clean. He was born again. 
■      ■       ■
Nearly 50 years since his con-
version, Junior’s skin is wrinkly and white. His voice is gravelly, as though someone wore it down with sandpaper. His muddy eyes sit be-hind golden-brown frames. 
Junior’s still a handsome man. 
His shoulders fill out collared shirts, and his silver hair is combed to the right. His back hurts, but not enough to keep him from preaching. The prostate cancer he suffered from two years ago would have kept him away for good, but he beat it. 
Junior stayed optimistic after 
accepting Christ, but his struggles didn’t end.
On November 29, 1979, he beat 
his wife, according to Alachua County court records. Five days lat-er, Junior pled no contest to spouse battery. A judge ruled him guilty, and he was sentenced to seven days in county jail.
Junior said he never hurt Debbie, 
“Otherwise, we wouldn’t still be to-gether.”
He said this is what happened: 
He and Debbie went over to a friend’s house in Windsor. The group discussed “life and religion.” Alcohol wasn’t involved. Conversa-tion turned to argument. A cop was called. “It wasn’t a big deal.”
Junior said he only spent two 
days in prison. The third day, he was released. 
One afternoon on the plaza, he 
raised a finger and pretended to touch someone’s hand. “If you do this,” he mocked, “it’s battery.” 
■      ■       ■
Service was about to start at the 
Church at Orange Heights. Women dumped out coolers and scraped off dinner plates. The sun set across the steeple. 
For 11 years, Junior’s been at-
tending the Hawthorne-based min-istry. During a recent service, he walked into the sanctuary and sat alone in the back.
Junior waved at a friend, shook a 
hand. A single word flashed across the screen: “FELLOWSHIP!”  
Junior pointed excitedly at the 
stage. “That’s my wife there in the choir!” he shouted over the crowd. 
As the opening bars of “Amaz-
ing Grace” floated across the room, Junior rose slowly with the congre-gation. 
He sang to himself, hands 
clasped, eyes clenched. Voices thun-dered around him:
“Amazing Grace, how sweet the 
sound....”
In three decades street preaching 
in Gainesville, Junior said he hasn’t saved anyone. But here, in his quiet center of faith, he was confident. 
When the congregation reached 
“that saved a wretch like me,” Ju-nior’s right hand shot up, waving side to side. His voice rose higher with the chorus of believers.
“Yes, Lord!” he shouted. “Yes!” 
■      ■       ■
Junior and Debbie live in Wind-
sor in a trailer-sized home five min-utes from the church where they met. The place sits behind a swing-ing gate at the end of a country road. It has a front porch for Junior’s crosses and a back porch for bird watching. 
The field, framed by trees, 
stretches in all directions. A wooden playground sits next to the house. The couple has 14 grandchildren with a 15th on the way, and they visit often.
Junior calls this wooded sanctu-
ary his “R&R” from the war zone on campus. But even here, the preacher tries to save souls.
In early April, Junior hosted a 
father-son church event. The men were going to teach the boys to shoot rifles.
Six hanging targets were perched 
on a dirt mound by the backyard pond.
“Is the line ready?” a man called 
out.
A string of young boys lying on 
their bellies nodded their heads. Fa-thers sat behind the smallest ones to help balance their shots.
“Fire!”  Six rifles boomed in the air. Tar-
gets bobbed, struck. Wild bullets kicked up dirt.
Junior sat under a canopy by the 
house, smiling. 
A teenager wearing glasses 
walked by. “He doesn’t have a fa-ther,” Junior muttered. 
Junior called to the boy. “How 
did you do?”
“I did all right,” he replied, hand-
ing over his target.
Junior examined the sheet, his 
eyes widening.
“This is good, good, good, good,” 
he marveled.
The boy’s older brother walked

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgTuesday’s question: Have you ever 
driven while drunk?No question today — just a sincere 
thank you for reading.I’m confused, and it’s the newspaper’s fault
There have been plenty of times in the past four 
years I’ve woken up confused.
That ﬁ  rst morning in Germany after I decided 
to study abroad without Googling the city I was mov-ing to.
That time I fell asleep tailgating on the plaza because 
8 a.m. is never OK.
Those Friday mornings post-Penny Wine (R.I.P.) 
when I somehow ended up safe in my bed.
And this week, when I realized the days at my 
mouse-less Alligator computer were dwindling.
The ﬁ  rst time I came to the ofﬁ  ce, I hobbled in on 
heels my professor convinced me were necessary only to ﬁ  nd a room full of bearded hipsters screaming pro-fanities in between bites of pizza.
I never thought I’d be at the paper until Thursday 
night turned into Friday morning, surrounded by peo-ple I trust with my life, ﬁ  ghting over commas, worried about words I didn’t write, feeling lucky to be there and knowing I should be.
The Alligator and I have had our ups and downs. 
I’ve cried in the ofﬁ  ce and because of it — most notably into a Taco Bell chicken soft taco, lost on the way to in-terview some Girl Scouts.
But somewhere in the middle of the bamboo-covered 
walls of a building that’s only changed minimally from the ‘70s, I found myself.
If you do one thing in college (and please don’t, be-
cause these stories need to last you a lifetime of ﬁ  rst dates and lunches with your boss’ signiﬁ  cant other), it’s this: Find your happiness, y’all.
I’ve spoken to a lot of people in the past four years 
— because a) I never shut my mouth and b) journalism — and a scary number of them don’t love what they’re doing.
Don’t major in accounting because your dad said so. 
Don’t decide on pre-med because it’s stable. Hell, don’t choose journalism because it’s what your mom did.
I’m going to be straight with 
you: Figuring out your life takes leaving the house and putting in the work. I would be a trag-edy without Netﬂ  ix. The $10 Wal-Mart blanket I bought on a whim has gotten me through some times. 
But I am who I am because of the Alligator.Because of the stupid headlines I wrote. Because of 
the stories I didn’t want to cover. Because of the hours I spent hanging around the ofﬁ  ce when I didn’t have to but couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. 
And most of all, because of the people.People who have seen me at my best and my worst, 
who accept me no matter how many times I meow at them in greeting or call something “a lot,” who have taught me what it takes to be a good journalist — and person.
This is what I wish for you: Find a path that feels 
right even when it sucks.
You’ll get rejected. You’ll get hurt. You’ll debate 
whether you should drown your sorrows in ice cream or tequila, and one hazy night, decide on both.
But it’s there. I promise.When I got to Gainesville, I was a reluctant Gator at 
best. 
And now, here I am, sitting at my desk in the apart-
ment I barely see (love you, 202), sobbing because it’s really the end.
It’s not a glamorous life, but I wouldn’t want it any 
other way.
And it’s this damn newspaper’s fault.Shayna Posses is a graduating UF journalism senior and 
the Alligator’s freelance editor.Sweat, tears and 
tacos: 
The editor’s story
It’s freshman year, and I’m walking along University Avenue, 
worrying that I’m too sweaty to go into the Alligator’s open house. My resume is in a purple folder stuffed with clips from 
my high school newspaper. I don’t know what AP Style is.
Fast forward. It’s ﬁ  nals week 2011, and I’m standing outside 
Library West in the dark on the phone with Clare Lennon. She’s asking if I want to be a staff writer. The December air is cold, but I feel warm.
Suddenly, it’s the day after my 
second obituary was published, the one I cried while writing, and the widow is calling me. I pick up, and she tells me she loved the story so much she saved 30 copies.
Then it’s the middle of the night, 
and Christian Aguilar’s body has just been found. Without hesitation, I call Chris Alcantara and open Google Docs. The article is online 10 minutes later, even though I’m still in pajamas.
Soon after, it’s the day of the 40-degree Tiffany Sessions 
press conference, and my co-workers are pitching the insane idea of writing a 2,500-word feature story in three hours. I’m so exhausted and so excited I’m agreeing.
Time ﬂ  ies when you’re having fun, and I’ve had a blast at 
The Independent Florida Alligator. I’ve written 164 stories about other people, but here’s mine — in pieces, like you’re ﬂ  ipping through the pages of a newspaper trying to ﬁ  nd what to read.
My Alligator story includes tough times, like when Unite 
Party trashed our papers and when I spelled “students” wrong on the front page. 
But it also has great times, like when I stacked 18 tacos from 
Tijuana Flats in my Sable for the staff’s dinner. 
Or the three times I set ﬁ  res in the ofﬁ  ce — one on purpose, 
two accidental. 
Or when Bernie Machen kicked me. (On purpose. It was 
playful. I think.)
At the Alligator, I’ve laughed and cried and yelled and 
worked 60-hour weeks and answered questions and napped on my ofﬁ  ce couch and called sources and drank Icees and rapped and gotten my hair ﬁ  shtailed and wrote my heart out.
It’s unusual to be editor-in-chief for two semesters, but my 
time in the newsroom — with its weird bamboo walls, broken chairs and inappropriate Wall of Shame — has been the best part of my story so far. Not to mention the characters: dozens of extremely talented journalists I get to call friends.
So, it’s a few hours from now, and I’m passing the pages in 
the ﬁ  nal issue. I’m nervous, as always, about how they’ll turn out, but deep down I know they’re ﬁ  ne. I’m turning out the lights in the newsroom, packing up and walking out of work at 1105 W. University Ave. one last time.
And here’s the kicker: I’m ready for my next chapter.Julia Glum is a graduating UF journalism senior and the editor-

I’ll probably never forget the 
Fourth of July last year: I was stuck on a pontoon boat 
under a bridge in a lightning storm. 
My family, best friends and 
I were soaked and freezing, but 
we sat huddled together and laughed hysterically. 
I think about that day a lot.
After four and a half years, two schools, 
two majors and four jobs, college looks like a kaleidoscope in my rearview mirror. 
It’s a collage of late nights, coffee, writing 
on deadline, tears, wondering how I was going to pull XYZ off and somehow pulling it off.
College is hard. College involves a lot of conﬂ  ict.But what I saw on the boat that day, and 
what I’ve come to realize during the last two years of working at the Alligator, is that discomfort and conﬂ  ict are necessary parts of life. 
And if doing journalism has taught me 
anything, it is to embrace the tension.
During my last two years at UF while 
I’ve been running around interviewing people and writing headlines and editing things, I’ve come to look at life like one big story.
As one of my favorite authors Donald 
Miller explained, writing a story and living well share common elements: conﬂ  ict, tension, confrontation, uncertainty, climax, resolution.
The conﬂ  ict is certainly real in a 
newsroom, or at least it is in ours. 
A dimly lit ofﬁ  ce with broken chairs, 
patchy Wi-Fi and bamboo-matted walls became the setting for a disorganized epic involving dozens of characters that stretched from 5 p.m. until 1 a.m. every night. 
The resolution: getting the paper into the 
racks and into the hands of students. The climax: seeing someone absorbed in the pages at a bus stop.I traded all my free evenings 
and down time to be part of that story because although it was hard, it was worth it. 
There’s something inspiring 
about writing and giving it away for free.
We all like resolution. We like happy endings. But I think the process along 
the way that gets us to the ending turns out to be the story after all.
I don’t remember how a lot of things 
in college resolved: the grades I got on assignments I stressed about, the way ﬁ  nancial aid ﬁ  ascos worked out — stuff that seemed so important at the time. 
But I do remember steps along the way.In my rearview mirror, I see the late 
nights in Library West when my best friend and I stiﬂ  ed laughs so loudly we risked sounding disrespectful. 
I see midnight runs to Redbox in cowboy 
boots and gym clothes when my roommate and I ditched studying. 
I see the night two fellow editors decided 
to dye my hair red and gave me bangs using 
paper scissors — and it worked.
I see sweating and cheering at football 
games.
But like I said, that’s the view from my 
rearview mirror now. 
As I watch graduation approach over my 
dashboard, I deﬁ  nitely feel the uncertainty. 
I can tell it’s probably going to be 
messy. 
But that’s nothing new.
I can’t predict how this next story is 
going to turn out, but I know the elements for a good story are there.
Conﬂ  ict is OK, and uncertainty is 
healthy.
So here’s to good stories, UF: Tell them, 
and live them.

Managing editor says fond farewell to the Alligator, collegeColumn
Freshman-year me 
thought it was so cool that UF had a 
student-run newspaper. 
Freshman-year me 
wondered if I would ever 
write for it. 
Fast-forward three and 
a half years, and here I am, spending 30+ hours a week at the Alligator. 
How did I get here, and how is it 
over already? 
I started working at the Alligator 
last Spring as a copy editor. 
My ﬁ  rst shift was a blur. 
It was the most fun I’d ever had 
working, and it was where I learned that this is what I want to do for a liv-ing. 
My last shift will also probably be 
a different kind of blur: involving a lot of tears and the feeling that gradu-ation is really happening. 
This semester, my job involved a 
lot of uploading stories to the website, writing headlines that made you (or Google) want to read them and late-late nights in the ofﬁ  ce. 
As a soon-to-be grad and a jour-
nalism major, I’m used to hearing the usual stress-inducing questions.
“Do you have anything lined up 
after graduation?”
“Are you still a journalism ma-
jor?”
“Just because your degree is in 
journalism doesn’t mean you have to do it for a living.”
I made my friends here, and I start-
ed my career here. 
UF gave me my education, but the 
Alligator shaped me as a journalist. 
There are things I’ll really, really miss — like laughing hysterically in our daily budget meetings, strug-gling to do simple math (even with a calculator) and driving home from work at 2 a.m., when it’s just me, Gainesville Po-lice cars and taxis driv-ing people home from Midtown.
I’ll miss going to Checkers after 
work and coming back to the ofﬁ  ce to sit in the parking lot and unwind with my closest friends. 
(Really, this is our idea of a party.)I’ll remember the craziest night of 
journalism I’ve experienced, huddled over a writer’s computer screen, copy editing our front-page Tiffany Ses-sions story with three other editors on deadline — the best damn coverage I read, by the way.
When and where else do you get 
the chance to make a newspaper ev-ery day and love nearly every minute of it? 
Sure, this ‘70s frat house building 
could use some new carpeting, chairs and walls. And computers. And desks. (We lost three chairs in one week this semester — RIP.) 
Yes, a faster Internet connection 
would be nice. 
But how much does all of that re-
ally matter? We’re scrappy, and I love it. 
It’ll be hard to match this experi-
ence, but I’m not worried. 
I know we’ll all cross paths soon 
enough.

In the last Student Senate meeting of 
the Spring semester, senators sparked a 
controversial debate before approving the Student Government executive branch po-sition recommendations. 
Although three senators spoke during the con portion of the debate, only Sen. Michael Christ voted in opposition to the recommendations. 
During the con portion of debate, Sen. 
Jessica Sullivan and another female sena-tor spoke about the lack of women who had been recommended as agency heads for the executive positions. 
Christ voiced his opposition for the Ac-cent Speaker’s Bureau and Student Gov-ernment Productions agency heads. 
Christ said he doesn’t doubt the quali-
fications of the three candidates recom-mended but said people are bred for these jobs.
“(There are) certain groups on campus 
that are groomed for these positions. It’s not my opinion. It’s a fact if you do your own research,” he said. “Senate can be intellectually honest with themselves — there’s something there when only one person applies for one of the top five most important positions in the Student Gov-ernment.” 
Christ also said he didn’t agree with the 
decision to recommend two candidates to co-chair the SGP position. 
He said SG was a “wide enigma” to 
students and didn’t feel it was accessible enough. 
Sen. Leah Miller spoke during the pro 
portion of debate and commented on the three candidates’ qualifications for each position. 
“The people who are up for Accent and 
SGP have a serious background in both of those agencies,” she said. “It’s bewildering to me that we are questioning that.” 
In response to the application accessi-
bility, Sen. Austin Sherman said the posi-tions were open to all students.
He said the positions were well-ad-
vertised through emails, publication and website availability. 
“Thousands of students were reached 
with these applications,” he said. “I don’t think I need to speak anymore on Accent and SGP because if you read the resumes and you’ve met the people, they’re un-doubtedly qualified. There was ample op-portunity to apply. Regards to the num-ber of applicants, I don’t think that’s the best argument because these people care enough to apply.” 
Student Body President Cory Yeffet, 
who aided in compiling the list of execu-tive position candidates, said the lack of accessibility to SG was “nonexistent” and that he approved of every recommenda-tion.  
“I assure each of you that all 100 per-
cent of these nominations are going to do an incredible job for this Student Body,” he said. 
Two of the recommended candidates — 
Michael High for athletics and recreation executive secretary and Destiny Goede for Greek affairs cabinet director — were stricken from the recommendations list before senators voted. 
Senate President Dylan Fisher said the 
candidates contacted the executive board, and due to personal reasons, were unable to accept their recommendations. 
In addition to the executive branch ap-
proval, senators approved a resolution honoring the victims of the Fort Hood shooting as well as funding for the Gradu-ate Student Council Welcome Week Events and a Ramadan lecture series.

If a Santa Fe College student 
needs to use the bathroom, there 
are two options: male or female.
If students identify as both, or 
look like one but identify as the other, they face difficult decisions — and possible harassment from other students.
SFC Faculty Senate voted to 
change that Tuesday, with a 27-0 consensus in favor of a resolution that expands the college’s anti-discrimination regulations to include members of the LGBTQ community. 
“If we have it on paper, 
we can set a precedent,” said student Sen. Wallace Mazon, who authored the resolution. “We can take action to swoop down on this harassment.” 
Mazon said the issue surfaced 
after a recent harassment incident in which a student was followed off campus to Publix being heckled for using the “wrong” bathroom in the SFC cafeteria.
The resolution would add 
sexual identity, gender identity and gender expression to the list of protections offered by College Rule 2.8, SFC’s nondiscrimination and harassment policy.
“This was a battle that was 
won today — an important battle,” said George Briggs, senator for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. “I’ve been through this in the past, supporting this resolution the past two times it’s come through the Faculty Senate floor. We have a tough battle in Career Service Council, but I believe we can win it.”
Although the Faculty Senate 
approved the rule’s expansion, there are three governing bodies that oversee SFC: the Student Senate, Faculty Senate and the  Career Service Council. 
According to Student Senate 
members, SFC President Jackson Sasser needs all three bodies to be in agreement before he will take a side on a controversial issue. 
The past two times, the Career Service Council has put the brakes on the resolution.
“In the past, there have 
been individuals who have cited personal judgments, and personal judgments have stood in the way of progress,” said Student Senate President Jeremy Pierce, who presented the issue to about 40 faculty members at Tuesday’s meeting. “We hope that this time around folks won’t interject their personal judgments but do what’s good for all of the students.”
At UF, a similar code already 
exists. 
The UF Non-Discrimination 
Policy states that the university  is “committed to non-discrimination with respect to race, creed, color, religion, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, marital status, national origin, political opinions or affiliations, genetic information and veteran status.”
But Pierce said “personal 
politics and legal issues” are what’s holding SFC back.
He continued: “I feel like it 
will pass (the Career Services Council) because leadership is different. Santa Fe is moving in the direction of a more diverse college.”

� LAUGHING REDUCES STRESS.
ASHLEY KOBZA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Giggling your way to good 
grades may be a possibility. 
According to the results of a new 
study by Loma Linda University 
in California, laughter increases short-term memory in older adults, as well as reduces stress hormones, lowers blood pressure and increas-es mood state.
“Humor is very interesting as a 
research topic,” Dr. Glen Finney, division chief for behavioral neu-rology at UF, wrote in an email. “Laughter may be our way of tell-ing ourselves and others to relax.”
Finney said the study highlights 
the importance of behavioral neu-rology and neuropsychology in understanding how humans func-tion.
“(Laughter) may have to do 
with thinking about something 
more positive,” said Joanne Byars, a behavioral neurology fellow at UF. “It could be providing a differ-ent perspective on the world.” 
The study of laughter is an 
emerging ﬁ  eld, Byars said, and the Loma Linda study is a promising step for the future of behavioral neurology.      
For students like De-Vaughn 
Williams, a 22-year-old UF food science and human nutrition se-nior, laughter could be a cure for ﬁ  nal exam stress.
He said bringing laughter into 
his medical profession could be a smart career move.
“The biggest issue right now is 
being able to afford health care,” Williams said. “Laughing is free.”Laughing scientiﬁ  cally

Amazon.com announced last 
week it will be charging sales tax 
for Florida customers. 
The 6-percent tax will be ap-plied to all goods purchased ex-cept groceries, medicines and vi-tamins and supplements, lining up with Florida’s tax laws. Ty Rogers, a spokesman for Amazon, wrote in an email that the online retailer will be required to collect sales tax starting May 1.
The tax was spurred by the re-
tailer’s plans to add two additional warehouses in Florida, according to a Tampa Bay Times article. 
Chelsea Byard, a manager at 
Zell’s Hardware, located at 3727 W. University Ave., said her store having to charge sales tax has put them at a disadvantage to online retailers like Amazon.
Byard said the tax on Amazon’s 
goods will help. She said although shelves are barer than they were when the store opened 50 years ago, the store still tries to provide the best service at the lowest pric-es.
“Of course our stuff is a bit 
more expensive, but we have to survive,” she said.

The University Athletic Associa-
tion is looking to gain perspective on the fan experience by creating 
the Fan Advisory Council.
Jenn Mereby, UAA guest ser-
vices coordinator, said 12 council members will offer suggestions for how to improve the gameday atmo-sphere.
Mereby said the UAA will se-
lect representatives from several season-ticket-holder demograph-ics, including current students and boosters.
She said staff members typically 
work during games, preventing them from watching as fans, which is why the council’s perspective will be valuable.
Applications, which close on Sunday, are on GatorZone.com.
Mereby said the council’s diver-
sity could provide insight on enter-taining fans of all varieties.
“The issue that needs to be dis-
cussed is how we can help students come in, but at the same time help people who have been season ticket holders for 40 years still have a good time at the game,” she said. 
Although the council will focus 
on football, the insight could be ap-plied to other sports, she said.
Michael Tomonto, an 18-year-
old UF mechanical engineering freshman, said the council is a way the athletic department can recon-nect with fans after a losing season.

A new bill to allow con-
cealed guns in public without a 
permit is being met with oppo-sition from the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.
HB 209, a National Rifle As-
sociation-backed bill, would al-low legal gun owners to conceal weapons without a concealed carry permit in a mandatory evacuation caused by a state of emergency. It passed the Flori-da House 80-36 Friday despite clear opposition by the Florida Sheriffs Association.
Local law enforcement has 
the authority to declare a state of emergency. In Alachua County, state of emergency evacuations have been declared for flooding in 2012 and drought conditions in 2006, among others. 
Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office spokeswoman Sgt. Becky Butscher said the depart-ment supports the sheriffs asso-ciation’s stance because “there’s no real clear boundaries” with the bill.
“It’s kind of a huge safety is-
sue,” Butscher said. “You’ve got heightened emotions, weapons on top of it. It’s a recipe for di-saster.”
State Rep. Heather Fitzen-
hagen sponsored the bill. Ed-ward Metzger, her legislative aide, said it was sparked from concerns following Hurricane Katrina. 
“Obviously this isn’t al-
lowing anyone to break laws,” Metzger said. “It’s allowing them to evacuate.” 
Supporters of the bill, like 
Florida Carry executive direc-tor Sean Caranna, said the cur-rent law prohibiting concealed carry without a permit violates residents’ rights. 
“Taking away people’s right 
to bear arms when the state can’t come to protect you is a violation of the very core of the Second Amendment,” he said.
UF political science junior 
Cherie Bynum said the bill’s ambiguity can be a problem if people misunderstand its boundaries. For example, it’s unclear as to when the evacu-ation ends, and therefore when the law stops protecting those without permits.
At the same time, she said 
she can’t oppose it.
The 20-year-old member of 
UF Students for a Democratic Society said if anything should be reformed, it’s the “stand your ground” law. 
“I’m not the biggest gun 
supporter in the world, but I do recognize it as a right that’s in our constitution,” she said.

The FDA approval — or lack there-
of — of a controversial new alcohol 
product is stirring up Gainesville. 
Palcohol is a shot-sized package of 
powdered alcohol — just add water.
According to the Palcohol web-
site, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau approved the product.
However, the hype of the unusual 
alcohol concept was shot down Mon-day when a representative for the fed-eral bureau said the approvals were issued in error, USA Today reported.
Lipsmark, the privately held com-
pany that owns Palcohol, responded by saying the disapproval of labels does not mean disapproval of the product. The company will resubmit the labels and does not currently have an expected approval date.
“The very nature of the product fa-cilitates potential for its misuse, which could increase the risk of alcohol overdose and negative consequences associated with high-risk alcohol con-sumption,” wrote Julia Rae Varnes, a specialist at GatorWell Health Promo-tion Services, in an email.
Beth Desimone, a 25-year-old UF 
sports management junior, has been a bartender at :08 for almost three years.
“I think it’s a bad idea,” she said. 
“I think that they’re going to bring it with them inside of the bar instead of paying for drinks.”
She said if Palcohol becomes a fad, 
UF might even need to step up its se-curity on gamedays.
Sneaking in a packet of Palcohol 
into the Swamp and mixing it with water could go against policies listed on the the University Athletic Asso-ciation’s website.
“They’re going to have to do extra 
security checks where they’re check-ing everybody’s pockets and purses,” Desimone said.‘Palcohol’ draws reaction
“Obviously this isn’t

UF students Googling office 
hours for one professor might 
not like what they find — or they might.
UF professor Clay Calvert’s 
last name is now synonymous with mass media law and a porn star’s budding career. A UF alum-na who took his course decided to honor the professor by taking his name to the porn industry.
Casey Calvert, a rising star in 
adult films, graduated academi-cally and sexually during her time at UF. The Gainesville native thought pornography was illegal until she took Calvert’s class on mass media law as a sophomore, where she learned that the indus-try was legitimate and thriving.
“It felt right because really if I 
hadn’t taken his class, I wouldn’t be where I am right now,” Casey said. “I’m happier than I’ve ever been.”
The 23-year-old asked to be 
identified only by her stage name for confidentiality.
UF College of Journalism 
and Communications professor Calvert had no clue Casey was out there using his name in hardcore, softcore and every porn scene in between until he received an email from a student who had spotted Casey during his online activities. Casey also received a copy of the email, and she sent an apology to Calvert shortly afterward.
“I was startled to learn and 
discover an adult video star had taken my last name for her porn name,” Calvert said.Although Casey’s interest in 
porn reached back to her teenage years when she saw her first adult movies, she didn’t kiss a boy until her freshman year of college. She said she lost her virginity senior year.  
“I was essentially celibate be-
cause I wasn’t confident enough to go out and get a boyfriend,” she said. 
Her sexual curiosity extended 
to the hardcore-bondage scene, where her first foray into adult modeling took place. The then-college senior answered an ad on a fetish social media site from an Orlando man looking to do a bondage shoot.
Placing her trust in a stranger, 
Casey posed for pictures com-pletely tied up. Nothing sexual happened past her being nude, but she discovered a passion that would carry her through the early days of her career.
Once she graduated from UF in 
2012, Casey explored fetish pho-tography further, modeling for more than 300 shoots that spanned the spectrum of human sexuality. 
She even takes special requests 
— as long as they aren’t illegal. Her most memorable request to don scuba gear in the bedroom was trumped this year by a fan who wanted her to sexualize the movie “Gremlins 2: The New Batch.”“Porn is a safe way to explore 
fantasies,” she said. 
She stayed as a fetish model for 
about a year, until Mike Spiegler took notice of her.
Spiegler is an agent for adult ac-
tresses, and Casey said he’s choosy when it comes to picking new tal-ent. So when he asked Casey to sign a contract, she jumped at the opportunity.
She had a gentle transition into 
hardcore pornography, shooting a romantic and sensual scene for her first gig. The second shoot was over-the-top rough.
“I was so nervous that day. 
I thought I was gonna cry,” she said. “But once I got past that, I realized how much I like perform-ing for the camera.”
And for the first few months, 
Casey’s career was like that — nervous before shoots but a per-fectionist once she got on set. She found a new confidence while she did everything under the sun in pornography.
One year and more than 100 
men later, Casey grew from a wide-eyed adult actress to a con-tender for Best New Starlet for 2014’s Adult Video News Awards. Though she didn’t take home any awards, her fans’ reactions have been consistent: Casey is hot stuff.
Now, she’s living in Los Ange-
les, earning a comfortable six fig-ures and dating a director in the industry.
Casey isn’t the only UF student 
to dabble in porn. She said she knows of a couple alumni who are in the industry and a few cur-rent students modeling for fetish shoots. Although her alter ego was 
never outed publicly during her time at the university, she knew the threat of criticism and sham-ing was real. That same threat ex-ists for students now entering the adult industry who walk the thin line between their public and pri-vate lives. 
“We use stage names for a rea-
son,” she said. “If a girl wanted to come out as a fetish model, it’s her responsibility.”She said the negative stereo-
types associated with porn are mostly untrue. Most girls are there because they want to be, and the confidence she’s gained from her time in the industry was unrivaled by anything she’s experienced in life.
“I love all the different oppor-
tunities that porn gives me,” she said. “Some days I go to work and I just make smut, but other days I go to work and I make art.”

Another UF student took the stage  
and the crown at the 2014 Miss Flori-
da United States Pageant last month. 
Tia McDonald, a 20-year-old UF 
public relations senior, will go on to represent Florida in the national Miss United States competition in Washington, D.C., from July 4 to 6.
“There’s so much that goes into 
(nationals),” McDonald said. “We’re going to be there a week ahead of time for appearances and practic-ing for the different categories of the competition.”
McDonald said she found local 
competition to be tough but used her public relations skills to win the title and go on to nationals.
“UF has really prepared me for 
nationals,” McDonald said. “(In ear-lier pageants) I didn’t go in with any kind of business or public relations plan, and I had no idea how to reach out on social media.”
Miss Florida is no stranger to pag-
eants. 
She estimates she has won 75 pag-
eant titles and about 30 crowns since she started competing as a 6-month-old.Tina Chisholm, Miss Florida Unit-
ed States pageant director, was one of the ﬁ  ve judges to review McDonald’s 
application for this year’s pageant.
“The fact that she is so educated 
and such a go-getter made Tia stand 
out,” Chisholm said.McDonald said she plans to use 
her degree to work with nonproﬁ  ts.
Her passion for community ser-
vice and beauty pageants began at age 10, when her mother, a nurse, had a patient with Down syndrome visit their house.
“She kept on saying ‘I want to be 
in pageants. I want to be in pageants.’ But there weren’t any special needs pageants available,” McDonald said.

May 1 has the potential to go 
down in Gainesville history — 
maybe even world history.
Gator Stompin’, organized by 
the Pledge 5 Foundation, is a pub crawl in its 32nd year. This year the organization is boasting a world-re-cord attempt for the world’s largest pub crawl.
In order to break the record, 
more than 4,700 people would have to check in at each of 10 bars, said Jason Bowman, director of the foundation. 
“Every year the event grows, so 
I would anticipate sometime in the next few years Gainesville will hold the record for world’s largest pub crawl,” he said.
The current record is held by 
Crawl for Cancer for a pub crawl in Kansas City, Mo., that took place last year, according to the Guinness World Records 2013.
Gator Stompin’ includes almost 
every bar in Midtown and down-town, and many restaurants are involved as well, he said. Pledge 5 is expecting more locations to par-ticipate than the 85 that “stomped” last year.
Although it started as just a pub 
crawl, the event has turned into a festival over the years. The addi-tions of music, food, activities and a kickoff concert on Bo Diddley Community Plaza have helped it expand, he said.
“I heard Waka Flocka (Flame) 
was going to be there, and that’s what caught my interest,” said Jon-athan Haney, a 20-year-old UF mar-keting sophomore who is attending the crawl with his roommate.
Bowman said about 25 artists 
will perform, including Wolfgang Gartner, Hoochie and Chuck Ragan from Hot Water Music.
Heather Lilholt, director of com-
munity events for Pledge 5, said for those who are a part of the organi-zation, the event is more than just a pub crawl.
“When people come out and 
support the cause, you’re not just supporting local business, but you’re supporting a great founda-tion that is working toward gener-ating volunteers,” Lilholt said. “It’s all in all a good cause, no matter what way you look at it.”WEDNESDAY, APRIL 23, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 19

JACKSONVILLE — Nearly three 
dozen sea turtles that were rescued 
on Cape Cod last fall were released off Florida waters Tuesday.
The 31 endangered and threatened 
sea turtles spent months at the New England Aquarium’s rescue center near Boston. The group was trans-ported in a caravan of three cars to the sand dunes of Jacksonville’s Little Talbot Island State Park, where three aquarium biologists and six rescue volunteers unloaded the sea turtles in their individual padded plastic crates and placed each one about 30 feet from the breaking waves, the aquarium said in a statement.
“What better way to celebrate Earth 
Day than the life afﬁ  rming act of re-turning dozens of rescued and endan-gered animals to their ocean home,” the statement said.
The turtles were mostly juveniles, 
including 28 Kemp’s Ridleys, the most endangered, two loggerheads and one green sea turtle, ofﬁ  cials said.
They washed up last November 
and December in the frigid waters of Cape Cod Bay and slowly became hy-pothermic. At the aquarium’s sea turtle hospital in Quincy, Mass., they were treated for malnourishment, dehydra-tion, pneumonia and other blood and organ disorders.
More than 80 sea turtles have been 
taken to the New England Aquarium so far this year.31 sea turtles released

University Police will soon be on the prowl 
for bikes left on campus over Summer break. 
Ofﬁ  cers will impound all unused bikes 
around campus beginning in about a week and 
continuing into the Summer A term, UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb said.   
“The easiest thing for everyone is just take the 
bike home with you,” Holcomb said.
Police will scope out areas around residence 
halls and put bright orange tags on bikes in the areas, he said. Students can remove the tags, and the bikes will not be impounded.
Holcomb said he encourages students to reg-
ister their bikes with the department, which can be done by patrolling ofﬁ  cers or by visiting its ofﬁ  ce.
The registration process is simple: a UF decal 
is put on the bike. Then, the bicycle’s serial num-ber, make, model and other general details are entered into the database and the owners’ con-tact information is recorded, Holcomb said.
If a registered bike is impounded by UPD during the summer, the owner will be emailed and given an opportunity to pick up the bike within 30 days before it is sold into auction, Hol-comb said. 
Bike Works, a local bike shop, is offering stu-
dents another alternative.
The shop, located at 2300 SW 34th St., is charg-
ing $10 a month to store students’ bicycles at its facility during the summer.
Tony Cousins, manager of Bike Works, said 
the shop offers a safe and secure place to store the bikes.
Kevin Montes, a 20-year-old UF physics soph-
omore, said he needs to ﬁ  nd a place for his bike so he doesn’t have to leave it on campus and risk it being impounded.
“Sure, my bike isn’t worth much to others, but 
she’s gotten me through this semester,” Montes said. “I’ll do whatever it takes to keep her for an-other one.”UPD to begin taking unused bikes

TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Rick Scott sup-
ports the legalization of the reﬁ  llable half-
gallon beer containers that craft beer lovers call growlers, his ofﬁ  ce said Tuesday.
The growler issue has been in the middle 
of a bitter ﬁ  ght between Florida’s craft brew-eries and Budweiser distributors that only want the half-gallon growlers legalized in a bill that adds more regulation to the rapidly growing craft beer industry.
Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said 
Tuesday whether he signs a bill to allow 64-ounce growler sales at Florida craft brew-eries is still to be determined. It will depend on the language that gets to his desk.
Breweries can now sell unlimited gallon 
and quart growlers, but Florida’s odd con-tainer laws prohibit the half-gallon size that’s the industry standard in 47 states. Legalizing the half-gallon size is the top priority of this legislative session for the booming craft beer industry.
But a Senate bill (SB 1714) ties the growl-
er size to more regulation that brewers say would hurt the craft beer industry and slow its growth. It includes language that would force all but the smallest breweries to buy their own bottles and cans of beers from dis-tributors before they can sell them to brewery visitors. Gov. Scott backs beer growlersSTATE� A FORMER UF FOOTBALL    
PLAYER’S FAMILY WAS AFFECTED.
SEAN STEWART-MUNIZ
Alligator Staff Writer sstewart-muniz@alligator.org
For years, Renee Trautwein went be-
tween blaming and missing her daughter.
Sarah Trautwein, a 19-year-old Univer-
sity of South Carolina student and sister of 
former UF football player Phil Trautwein, was driving home on Interstate 95 in 2009 when she lost control of her 2005 Chevy Cobalt and crashed into a tree.
When Trautwein got the call, she 
couldn’t believe it. She heard the police say Sarah had fallen asleep at the wheel and died on impact. Her daughter was gone, and she didn’t even know Sarah was on the road. She was supposed to come home from Hilton Head, S.C., on Saturday, but she left early Friday to be with her mom and see the family shih tzu, Sonnie.
“Whenever I had a meltdown, I’d be 
mad at Sarah for getting in that car,” she said. “I was weak, and for ﬁ  ve years I ac-cepted that — until recently,” she said.
Renee said she saw news reports about 
four weeks ago of a controversial recall on several General Motors vehicles, and the reports haunted her. Her suspicions took hold when she heard stories of accidents similar to her daughter’s. A lawsuit was being ﬁ  led by Texas lawyer Bob Hilliard.
The family contacted Hilliard, whom 
Trautwein said was sure Sarah’s accident was due to the faulty part in the recall, so he began an investigation.
She said Hilliard returned a week later 
with the police accident report and star-tling news — Sarah’s airbag never de-ployed, which is one warning sign that her car was affected by the faulty part.
Since then, the Trautweins have joined 
the group of families who lost loved ones because of the faulty part and are ﬁ  ghting to raise criminal charges against GM. 
Trautwein attended the April congres-
sional hearing where GM’s late recall of 2.6 million vehicles with the ignition defect was called into question.
She sat in the room while GM CEO Mary Barra was questioned by Congress’ House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee about the company’s late action and the subse-quent deaths and injuries. 
Reuters reported GM learned of the de-
fect in Chevrolet Cobalt, Saturn Ions and several other models in 2001 but hadn’t is-sued a recall until February. 
GM employee statements citing costs 
associated with a recall may have discour-aged the company from replacing the part in the vehicles. The replacement part cost 57 cents, according to Reuters.
A press release from GM stated the 
company is recalling these vehicles be-cause the ignition switches’ resistance might be below GM speciﬁ  cations. In the case of a switch below the standard, any more weight than the key itself or a “jar-ring event” might turn the ignition out of the “run” position.
“Ensuring our customers’ safety is our 
ﬁ  rst order of business,” said GM North America President Alan Batey in a press release. “We are deeply sorry, and we are working to address this issue as quickly as we can.”
Trautwein said she felt sick during the 
hearing. She said she felt Barra’s responses were scripted and cold.
She recalled that Sarah had a Vera 
Bradley wallet on her keychain, holding her credit card, driver’s license and some loose cash. It was heavy enough to turn the ignition, cutting her power steering, power brakes and airbags. 
The family bought Sarah the car her se-
nior year of high school from a GM dealer-ship in New Jersey. It was Gator blue with a small orange line running down it. 
She remembers driving home with 
her daughter the day before the accident, when Sarah turned to her and said “Mom, I love my car.”GM recalls too late for family

Erica Brown’s 4-year-old son doesn’t un-
derstand why his family can’t go home.
Brown and her three children have been 
living in a hotel since early January because of 
the mold in their Horizon House apartment. The complex’s mold problem has driven resi-dents to sleep in their living rooms and throw out hundreds of dollars in belongings.
Ofﬁ  cials say there’s nothing they can do.“I want a place where I can not be worried 
about things getting into the walls and into our lungs,” the 26-year-old single mother said. 
She ﬁ  rst noticed the problem last year, a 
couple months after moving into the complex at 1515 NW 10th St. Brown and her two daugh-ters  suffer from asthma, so after spotting mold, she immediately called maintenance.
It was months before an employee came 
by, sprayed bleach and painted the area. The complex offered to move her to another apart-ment, but she knew it wouldn’t make a differ-ence.
Resident Walette Mulberry, 38, had been 
dealing with mold for ﬁ  ve years. In the past year, it’s gotten worse.
For months, she and her two kids slept in 
the living room. One of the three bedrooms served as the closet and changing area. The other rooms were covered in mold.
Onteria Lawrence’s 4-year-old son, Timar-
kis Archie, played while she shoved a moldy bureau down the stairway leading up to her second-story apartment.
“I can’t afford to throw this away, but I got to,” Lawrence said. “Even my Bible, the Holy Bible, I have to throw away.”
She’s lost six pounds from the stress, watch-
ing as her kids got colds and ear infections she 
couldn’t prevent.  
The residents have no choice but to stay.    
Horizon House Apartments and its sister 
property, Sunset Apartments, are government subsidized. Federal agencies give low-income residents vouchers to help pay rent.
The complexes’ residents couldn’t afford 
apartments without the Section 8 housing pro-gram. They also can’t afford to leave.
■      ■      ■
City code enforcement has no standard for 
how much mold makes an apartment unliv-able. In the Florida humidity, it’s a lost cause, said Gainesville city spokesman Bob Woods. The department can only issue a violation if there’s a physical problem like faulty plumb-ing or a leaky roof.
The mold in Horizon House is most likely 
due to humidity, according to an email from code enforcement division manager Christo-pher Cooper. A late-January memo says the complex put the families up in hotels while the situation was remediated.
Months later, Brown’s family still shares 
the studio hotel room the complex started paying for after code enforcement visited. 
In early February, her neighbors received a 
notice from Horizon House that said the mold problem was being handled. Donald Mitchell, 27, whose cousin lives there, said so far they’ve knocked down a couple of walls.
“Trying to cover their mistakes,” he said.
■      ■      ■No one wants to be uprooted from their 
homes, but there’s nothing the city needs to do at this time, Woods said. That is, unless the families choose to pay for private companies to take air-quality samples.
Neither code enforcement nor the county 
health department has the resources to con-duct tests. But if results show the amount of mold in the air is hazardous, the property owner can receive a citation.
Woods isn’t sure of the threshold. He said 
he imagines the test results will state if a loca-tion is unsuitable for human habitation. In that case, the situation would fall under Chapter 13 of the city ordinances, which says owners cre-ating dangerous conditions are in violation.
Anthony Dennis, environmental health 
director for Alachua County’s Department of Health, gets a lot of calls about mold.
He never recommends testing: It tells ten-
ants what they already know.
Dennis mostly hears from renters who are 
stuck in leases. All he can do is offer advice and pass along pamphlets. 
“You’ll know if you have taken care of the 
problem because you can breathe,” he said.
But if it’s beyond repair, there’s nothing the 
health department can do. It, too, has no en-forceable standard.
Establishing one would be helpful, Den-
nis said, but because people react differently to mold, it’s difﬁ  cult to reach a consensus. In Florida, there will always be spores. It’s when humidity climbs to more than 50 or 60 percent that they’ll grow on household objects. Mold loves leather.
■      ■      ■Around the corner from Horizon House, 
Hayley Reese points to her 8-year-old daugh-ter playing in the Sunset Apartments court-yard, 1500 NW 12th St.
Reese, 27, said the girl sometimes thinks 
people are watching her at night. Once, she blocked the windowsill with a pillow. “In two days, it was covered in mold,” Reese said.
Poor air circulation is a major contributor to 
mold, Dennis said. Renters often keep their air conditioning off because of high utility costs or don’t have working units.
Reese is a waitress. Her husband is unem-
ployed. They have ﬁ  ve kids. But no matter how tight money gets, the air conditioning or heat is always on. The unit is one of the few appliances that works.
Staff is hard to reach. The ofﬁ  ce is closed on 
Mondays, and when it is open, the phone goes to voicemail.
Management did not return calls about this 
story. 
■      ■      ■
The courtyards of Horizon House and Sun-
set apartments are never empty.
In the morning, mothers sit in lawn chairs, 
gathering the energy to change into work uni-forms. At noon, young men greet their neigh-bors in single-strap sandals, passing around Black & Mild cigars. After school, kids run through the sand, laughing. 
Most of the residents know each other by 
ﬁ  rst name only. They don’t have their neigh-bor’s number, though they think their cousin or sister or homeboy might. But every day, they hang out in the courtyard together.
No one wants to go inside.

The at-bat defied reason. Jack-
sonville’s No. 9 batter, Dylan Dil-
lard, stepped to the plate with two outs and runners on second and third base. Right-hander Ryan Har-ris toed the rubber.
Harris had been a key cog in Florida’s mid-season resurgence. On Tuesday, the junior right-hander surrendered a three-run home run to Dillard off the blue banner hang-ing across the last row of bleachers beyond the left-field wall. The em-phatic late-game home run followed two consecutive hit batters and a sacrifice bunt.Jacksonville (14-25, 7-10 Atlantic 
Sun Conference) upset No. 6 Florida (27-14, 12-6 Southeastern Confer-ence) in a 3-1 victory Tuesday night in McKethan Stadium. UF scored only one run on a second-inning solo home run by Zack Powers. The defeat snapped a six-game winning streak.“Guy runs into one. It’s as simple 
as that,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “You’ve got to locate, especial-ly when you’re playing in a one-run game. It’s one of those things where the margin of error is very small.”
O’Sullivan added: “I don’t want 
this to be a focus on Ryan. He’s been throwing the ball really great for us for three years. The bottom line is JU did a really nice job in that inning.”
For six frames, it appeared Pow-
ers’ second home run of 2014 would be enough. Right-hander Karsten Whitson was dealing in his first start since April 1. Tuesday night would’ve been his first win in nearly two months. He posted a season-high five strikeouts in five innings. Four of his five strikeouts came on sliders, including two to end Dil-lard’s first two at-bats. 
Whitson, who was working on 
a pitch count, finished at 61 pitches. Forty-one of those were strikes. He struck out batters to end the second, fourth and fifth innings. Whitson avoided any runs in the first inning after third batter Connor Marabell walked, and Scott Ricci followed with a single to right field that Braden Mattson didn’t field cleanly. The error put runners at second and third with two outs.
“I thought Karsten threw really 
good. He did everything that I had hoped for. That’s the disappoint-ing thing. It’s been a tough road for him, and he comes out tonight and throws as good as he has in a while,” O’Sullivan said. “I was just hoping that our guys would rally around him and be a bit more motivated at the plate, and we just weren’t.”
Midweek games have been a 
pain for the Gators. Florida racked up three straight wins against Flor-ida State but also lost to Florida Atlantic. This latest setback comes against an injury-riddled team that lost 6-1 to the Seminoles in Tallahas-see a week ago.
The go-ahead home run has 
extra meaning for Dillard, who en-tered the season as Jacksonville’s cleanup hitter. JU coach Tim Mon-tez gradually moved the sophomore outfielder lower in the order. At .252 entering the game, Dillard was well below his team-leading .304 average that earned him Atlantic Sun All-Freshman squad honors in 2013.
“Good for Dylan Dillard. He’s 
been struggling a bit. We put him down in the bottom of the order the last couple of games to try and get him fastballs in that spot,” Montez said.
While Florida comes back tonight 
at 7 for a home game against Florida A&M, Jacksonville has nine days off for final exams. The Dolphins had lost six of their eight games versus top-25 teams. 
Jacksonville wanted this win in 
front of a sizable amount of fans above the first-base dugout. Dol-phins players filled their ticket list with requests from family, friends and fellow team members who didn’t travel with the team. 
“Definitely, especially coming off 
of Florida State,” Dillard said of their increased motivation. “We wanted to at least knock one big dog off.”

LAYNE WEITZEL
Alligator Writer @laynejweitzel
After 27 years at the helm of the Florida 
men’s golf program, coach Buddy Alexander 
is hanging up his hat.
Alexander announced Tuesday morning at 
a team meeting that he will retire after the golf season ends, which could be soon. The Gators will compete at the Southeastern Conference Tournament starting on Friday.
If they perform well, they may get a bid in 
an NCAA Regional, but if they don’t, Alexan-der’s career will end on the greens of the Sea-side Golf Club in St. Simons Island, Ga.
“I just thought it was a good time to do it,” 
Alexander said in a release. “The competitor in me isn’t crazy about the fact this isn’t one of our better teams, and you would like to fix the problem, but for me, it’s just time to go. I still have a heck of a lot of energy, but I probably don’t have the patience and the passion that I might have once had. It just felt like before the tournament was the right time.”
After the 2012-13 season concluded, Alex-
ander, 61, began to speak with UF athletics director Jeremy Foley about the possibility of retirement. About a month ago, he met with Mike Spiegler, the UF senior associate athlet-ics director, to further discuss retirement op-tions.
Alexander, who has coached at Florida 
longer than Foley has held his athletics direc-tor position, has brought success to the men’s golf program, including eight SEC Champion-ships and two NCAA Championships in 1993 and 2001. He has won eight SEC Coach of the Year honors and helped de-velop PGA Tour pros such as Chris DiMarco, Dud-ley Hart, Brian Gay, Billy Horschel, Matt Every and Camilo Villegas.
He is also UF’s longest-
tenured coach and is sec-ond all-time, behind only Dave Fuller, who coached 
the baseball program for 28 seasons.
Prior to his time at UF, Alexander coached 
men’s and women’s golf at his alma mater, Georgia Southern, from 1977 to 1980 and men’s golf at LSU from 1983 to 1987. He start-ed at UF in January 1988.
“I came to Florida because I thought it gave 
me a great chance to compete,’’ Alexander said. “You get into coaching initially because you love golf, you love kids and you love to compete. 
“Life and golf are so similar. There are 
many ups and downs and highs and lows. Today is one of those days that stir all kinds of emotion. It’s sad that my time has come, but I’m happy everything worked out so well. I am in a good place, as will our golf program in the future.”
Alexander’s retirement will officially begin 
June 30, and Foley will soon begin a nation-wide search for the next coach. Foley has said that Alexander is willing to help in any way he can.
“He’s one of the all-time greats,’’ Foley said 
in a release. “He’s had a heck of a run. There’s no better Gator than Buddy Alexander.”

inning.”

AS STEIN ON TV
My childhood is over.
Not in the “Oh-no, I-just-under-
stood-a-dirty-joke-in-my-favorite-
childhood-movie” sense. It’s legitimately 
over.
In fewer than two weeks from the time 
this is printed, I will cross the stage at the O’Connell Center and ofﬁ  cially end my ten-ure at the University of Florida. After that, I have to make my way in this scary “real world” that I’ve heard so much about.
A few months after that, Derek Jeter — 
my favorite baseball player from my favorite baseball team — will do something similar, receiving his last ovation from fans at Yan-kee Stadium as an active player. 
Jeter is the last on-ﬁ  eld link I have to my 
childhood as a baseball fan.
When I started watching baseball as an 
8-year-old kid in 2000, Jeter was the be-all, end-all for me. When I had to a do a proj-ect about myself for my ﬁ  fth-grade class, I pasted a Jeter baseball card to the “heroes” section.
So watching my one-time hero leave the 
playing ﬁ  eld is strange for me.
I got a chance to see Jeter play for the last time on Sunday in Tampa. He looked mostly the same. His inside-out swing still laced balls into right ﬁ  eld. 
But something 
was different. Something was 
off. He looked slow in the ﬁ  eld, and he left an extra-inning game — against a division rival, no less — early.
And like Jeter, it’s time for me to move on 
to the next part of my life.
As an aspiring sports writer, I don’t want 
to be watching games as a fan anymore. I want to be in the press box, watching them, analyzing them and sharing my insights with people.
My goal is to one day cover Major League 
Baseball for a living. I’m going to get a small taste of that this summer when I follow in the footsteps of several alligatorSports writ-ers before me and make the 30-hour drive out to Phoenix to cover the Arizona Dia-mondbacks for MLB.com as part of its an-nual internship.
But to do that and continue toward my 
dream job, I need to make certain sacriﬁ  ces — namely, my fandom.
That will have to do.I have 299 bylines or other various entries 
in the Alligator archives. This is No. 300. I’m thankful for the chance to write every one of them. Each one, hopefully, moved me just a little bit closer to my dream.
The Alligator provided me with a chance 
to develop my reporting and writing abili-ties. I think I’ve gotten OK at them, and there are some people who helped me get where I am now. Here comes the cliché thank yous so you can tune out if you’re not interested.
First, I want to thank Nina, who has seen 
me through all the stress related to the Alli-gator and listened to more rants about dead-lines, writers, SIDs and the like than I would care to admit. She always has my back, and I can’t thank her enough for that.
Obviously, I need to thank my parents 
and family. Without them, I quite literally wouldn’t be here.
I need to give a shoutout to Joe Morgan, 
who decided to take a chance on a writer fresh out of his ﬁ  rst real writing class and put me on a beat. Thank you for being a great editor and friend. In addition, I’d like to thank Greg, Corey, Phillip, Katie, Landon, Pincus, Zoop, Jordan, Julia, Kelcee, Matt and everyone else who helped make my time with alligatorSports memorable.
Finally — and probably most cliché-y — I 
want to thank everyone who took the time to read my articles and columns.
I love when people tell me what they 
think of what I wrote, good or bad, praise or — my personal favorite — an email tell-ing me that if ignorance is bliss, I must be very happy.
Last summer, I was standing in line at the 
Reitz Union Starbucks, and I heard a man reading my column to a woman he was sit-ting with. He was reading the words that I wrote down the night before.
That was an indescribable moment for 
me, and I try to take that into consideration whenever I write anything to be published.
Someone might be reading this to their 
friend or child or spouse, so I better make every word count.
Thanks for reading.
Editor enters adulthood as college career comes to end
Adam Lichtenstein
Twitter: @alichtenstein24I never got the musical tal-
ents of my mother. She per-formed as a child with her 
musical-group family. I per-formed on the ball ﬁ  elds (or at least tried to).
It’s something I have always 
shared with my father. 
We both attended Palmetto 
High School in Miami, where his name is carved on an Ath-lete of the Year plaque from the early 1980s. 
I used to periodically check 
out the trophy case during the school day to see if it was still there. 
We both spent our Satur-
days together watching Florida Gators football. I eagerly wait-ed Sunday through Friday for the usual CBS kickoff and that catchy theme song. My adoles-cent years were spent receiving jabs from Miami Hurricanes fans, who always seemed to re-appear when the wins piled up.
High school was spent div-vying time between the school newspa-per and the school baseball team. I turned to journal-ism once I became a UF student — where I also realized the baseball thing wouldn’t work out.
I still watched games with 
my father, albeit six hours apart, with him dozing off in his leather chair back home and me sometimes dozing off in the press box watching the Gators try to score.
Once I started covering the 
team, the fervent bond built over the unlikely bounces on the football ﬁ  eld began to dis-sipate. 
When I graduate (the Van 
Wilder plan wasn’t an option), I’ll remember watching Connor Mitchell hit a game-winning single up the middle, or Tyler Murphy becoming the Swamp’s savior for a Satur-day. There’s the roar that radiates from the O’Dome every time the younger Billy Don-ovan attempts a three-pointer, too.
Such minor mo-
ments don’t mean much. 
They’re ﬂ  eeting. They come 
and go if you don’t pay atten-tion. The same goes for those Saturdays back home where I would recreate the ﬁ  rst-half highlights with my father out-side.
The same goes for the lan-
yards holding two 5-year-old BCS National Championship tickets dangling on a doorknob in my room across from the Swamp. 
They represent a memory; 
a time walking through the parking lot at Sun Life Stadium wearing that ticket like a badge of honor: My pops got me to the big game.
This isn’t a lecture on grow-
ing up watching college football with my father, although I feel fortunate that I did. It’s more about ﬁ  nding that somebody no matter whom they are. Just make sure they’re good at vent-ing and listening.
Thinking back to the night 
of the Final Four earlier this month, I stood in a crowded bar at 101 Cantina with a drink in my left hand and my father on my right. 
We could’ve made the 1,000-
mile trip to the Final Four. I’m glad we didn’t. He made the drive instead.
The drink of choice evolved 
from apple juice to gin and juice, but what hasn’t changed is having a best friend to watch the game with. 
While the reasons for watch-
ing may change, here’s hoping that the people you watch it with don’t.

GAME WINNING STREAK.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
Tim Walton likes where his team 
is at with the regular season draw-
ing to a close.
With a nine-game win streak and 
his team making strides at the right time, the ninth-year coach wants to see UF keep its pace.
“I always feel like this week and 
next week are two of the most im-portant weeks of the season,” Wal-ton said. “We’re deﬁ  nitely playing some of our best ball right now. It makes it a lot easier to go back to a good place if we do struggle the next couple weeks.”
In Florida’s road sweep against Texas A&M last weekend — its ﬁ  rst Southeastern Conference road sweep in its last ﬁ  ve series — the Gators held the Aggies to just ﬁ  ve runs while scoring 30 of their own.
“When we’re all on and hitting, 
it’s great,” senior Stephanie Tofft said. “We go through the lineup, and everyone’s up in the dugout, and it’s just exciting when everyone’s hit-ting. Especially at this point in the season since we’re getting closer to postseason, it’s great to have people coming up to bat and coming up big.”
No. 3 Florida (40-8, 11-7 SEC) is 
now tasked with ﬁ  nishing its ﬁ  nal four home games with a midweek matchup against South Florida (33-13, 7-5 American Athletic Confer-ence) tonight at 6 and a three-game series against Missouri (35-12, 12-6 SEC) starting Friday.
UF faced USF to open the season, 
winning the contest 10-3 in Tampa.
“In the 
ﬁ  rst game, we had the ben-eﬁ  t of some 
walks and some hit by pitches and a couple timely hits, but I deﬁ  nitely feel like (USF’s) offense was really good,” Walton said. “They showed some nice signs of being able to run a little bit, hit with some power up and down the lineup.”
Added Tofft: “It’s always a great 
series between us and them. They’re a great team. They’ve got some good players, some good pitching, so we’ll see how it goes.”
Tofft looks to continue her suc-
cess from Florida’s last series against Texas A&M.In the Gators’ three wins against 
the Aggies, she hit .700 with three home runs, notching 10 RBIs and six runs. Her performance not only made her the SEC Player of the Week, but also the NFCA National Player of the Week on Tuesday.
“It was really exciting to hit well 
all weekend. I was seeing the ball well, and it was really great to just get some hits,” Tofft said. “I was really relaxed. Having our pitchers do a good job on the mound helps you swing a little more comfortably when you know they’re doing their best.”
Added Walton: “It’s all about 
timing, I thought she really worked through all of her stuff and over-come maybe some preseason expec-tations that she might have had of herself.”Since transferring from Northern 
Illinois prior to her junior year, Tofft has been an active contributor for Florida.
The Lincoln, Calif., native started 
all 67 games in 2013 at third base — a position that she only had eight col-legiate appearances at prior to earn-ing the starting role at third for UF.
In her ﬁ  rst year, she posted a 
.332 batting average, 53 RBIs and 18 doubles.
With seven regular season games 
left, Tofft has a .326 clip at the plate, a team-leading 51 RBIs and nine home runs.
“Even though we’ve only had 
[Tofft] for two years, she’s as big of a part of our success as anybody,” Walton said. 
“She’s going to give you her all 
or nothing at all.”

recruiting
MORGAN MORIARTY
Alligator Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
Good things come to those who wait, or so the say-
ing goes. That adage couldn’t be truer when it comes to 
high school recruiting. 
For example, cornerback Jalen Thompson quickly 
went from being virtually unnoticed to being on every-one’s radar.
“My recruiting process has blown up a lot. A year 
ago I had no offers, and now I have 25,” Thompson said. “I can say I’m very blessed and I hope they keep coming.” 
UF offered Thompson, a student at Mobile (Ala.) 
St. Paul’s High, a scholarship in February. Coach Will Muschamp likes the 2015 recruit’s physicality at corner and playmaking ability on special teams.
“He says I have pretty good size, good speed and 
that I use my height to my advantage,” Thompson said. “And he just loves the way I make plays and return punts for touchdowns.”
Thompson has tentative plans to visit Florida this 
weekend depending on his high school baseball play-off schedule. His games last weekend forced him to re-schedule last Saturday’s planned trip to Gainesville. 
Thompson has thought about playing both baseball 
and football while in college. He said that most coaches have told him he can play both.. 
That could pan out well for him if he chooses the 
Gators, whose baseball team has the No. 1 RPI in the na-tion and checked in at sixth in the latest Baseball Ameri-ca poll following a sweep of UGA last weekend.
UF defensive backs coach Travaris Robinson, com-
monly known to his players as “Coach T-Rob,” has been heralded as the best recruiter on Florida’s staff. Thompson said his relationship with Robinson runs deeper than just football. 
“He talks to me on an everyday basis,” Thompson 
said. “Not only about just coming to Florida, just asking how my schoolwork is going or baseball is going — ev-eryday life.”  
UF has a talented young secondary heading into 
2014. Sophomore All-American corner Vernon Har-greaves III anchors the group, and early enrollees Jalen Tabor and Duke Dawson are looking to make an early impact. Thompson said although he likes the possibility of getting playing time early, it is an intimidating con-cept as well. 
“It’s very exciting but also nerve-wracking at the 
same time,” he said. “But another year or so, they’ll all be playing on ESPN with that good of a secondary.” 
Muschamp and his staff have 
molded several lockdown corners and shutdown safeties in their four years at Florida. Defensive backs 
Loucheiz Purifoy, Marcus Roberson and Jaylen Watkins are prospects in this year’s NFL Draft. Josh Evans started in 11 games with the  Jackson-ville Jaguars as a rookie last season, and Matt Elam started in 15 in his 
rookie season with the Baltimore Ravens. 
Thompson, who is listed at 5-foot-11 and 170 
pounds, returned two of his seven interceptions for touchdowns in 2013. He said defensive backs having professional success after UF serves as inspiration for him as a player.
“It’s very exciting, and it gives me motivation that 
one day I could be like them or be even better than them,” Thompson said.
Thompson plans to visit Florida, Georgia, South 
Carolina, Louisville, Alabama and Auburn during the upcoming summer. 
While UF’s 4-8 finish in 2013 might have been a rea-
son the coaching staff missed on some top recruits in the 2014 class, Thompson said he plans to stick with whichever team he commits to before the season kicks off on Aug. 23 regardless of its record.
Most of Thompson’s family resides in Mobile, which 
means staying close to home is a factor in his recruiting process. But Thompson’s family is supportive enough to let him go to whichever school fits him best — how-ever far from Alabama that may be. 
“I plan not to go over 10 hours [away] because that’d 
be hard for my parents to go to my games,” Thompson said. “But if I really love the school my mom said she wouldn’t mind driving that far or even flying up there every Saturday.”Three-star DB plans to visit Gators

� BANKS BACK TO FORM 
FOLLOWING OPERATION.
LAYNE WEITZEL
Alligator Writer @laynejweitzel
Eric Banks has already overcome 
much more than any challenge he 
will face on the golf course.
“If I hit a bad shot or something 
like that, I know it’s not the end of the world because I kind of almost know what the end of the world is,” Banks said.
Banks, a junior, underwent open 
heart surgery after a routine physi-cal during his freshman year of col-lege at Florida. At the beginning of April, he won the 2014 David Toms Award, an annual honor presented by the Golf Coaches Association of America given to a male collegiate golfer who has overcome adversity to achieve athletic excellence.
“I was pretty excited when 
[Conrad Ray, the GCAA’s national advisory board second vice presi-dent] first called me, and as soon as I found out, I called my parents right after, and they were all pumped up,” Banks said.
It definitely is a different, happier 
time compared with Banks’s first se-mester at UF in Fall 2011.
Before he began the 2011-12 sea-
son for Florida golf, Banks took a physical. It was then that doctors found a second heartbeat.
“I went in there, and the last 
thing was the heart guy [Dr. Beard],” Banks said. “I really hadn’t had any heart issues previous to that, and he just kind of caught it before it got real bad.”
Banks brushed off the physi-
cal results and played in three fall tournaments. His parents were still concerned and brought him home to Truro, a town in Nova Scotia, Cana-da, to be tested thoroughly.
Banks didn’t find out the results 
of the tests until the SunTrust Gator Invitational in February 2012. His parents made the trip down to tell him that he would need surgery to repair his heart, which had a hole between its two sides.
The junior admits now that he 
still didn’t fully understand what was going on.
“At first, I didn’t think it was a 
big deal at all,” Banks said. “I ob-viously knew there was more to [heart surgery] than it sounded, but I didn’t realize that I would not be playing competitive golf for nine months and couldn’t even walk up the stairs in my own house, so I defi-nitely didn’t realize the magnitude of it when I first found out.”
Because he didn’t need to have 
the surgery right away, Banks fin-ished out his freshman season of golf, playing in four regular-season tournaments, the Southeastern Conference Championship and the NCAA Regional and Champion-ships. Two weeks after the season ended, he returned to Canada to un-dergo his surgery.
In the four-hour surgery, doctors 
cut open Banks’ sternum, placed him on a heart-lung machine and began the surgery.
Banks remembers looking into 
the mirror before the procedure.
“It’s kind of hard to put 
into words unless you’re actu-ally in that situation,” he said.  “If something went wrong, it could’ve been the last day that I was alive.”
After the surgery, Banks stayed 
in the hospital for a week. He was then moved home, where he rested for three months.
“I was in a pretty rough place 
mentally anyway, so I didn’t really want to do anything, so I just sat around all day, and it was awful,” he said. “I was going crazy.”
The only form of exercise Banks 
was allowed to partake in was his rehab, where he would do stretches to keep his chest and sternum loose and walk in 30-second increments.
The then-sophomore decided to 
return to Florida for the fall semes-ter even though he was still in rough shape.
“At the time it really didn’t even 
seem like an option not to come back, so I just came back and didn’t even think about it,” he said.
Although Banks was in 
Gainesville, he wasn’t physically ready to participate in any tourna-ments, which didn’t affect coach Buddy Alexander.
“I was just more concerned with 
the safety and the health and the well-being of Eric in the long run,” Alexander said. “Whatever he need-ed to do, it was fine with me. I sort of knew that he wouldn’t be playing in the fall, but that was fine. That’s small stuff compared to what he had going on.”
When he first returned to 
Gainesville, Banks still suffered from an erratic heart rate and irregular blood pressure. He wasn’t allowed to do much with golf other than chip and putt. By late September, though, he was allowed to take full swings and increased his stretching and car-dio exercises.
“Our training staff here at UF 
[did] a terrific job of transporting him back and forth to the doctors and staying on top of it,” Alexan-der said. “We just kind of eased him back into it.”
Banks went to a check-up later in 
the fall, where he was told that his heart was fully healthy. He qualified for the 2013 SunTrust Gator Invita-tional, but Alexander chose to play him as an individual because the tournament called for playing 36 holes in one day. Banks finished tied for 10th place and went on to play in every tournament that spring.
Alexander doesn’t see one of 
his best golfers as a victim, but as a tough and mature athlete.“I think he dealt with it the same 
way you would deal with it, too,” Alexander said. “If you had to do it, what’s your option?”
Banks believes this experience 
has changed his perspective on life. 
“I appreciate everything,” he said. “When the weather’s nice I’ll take a second to step back and just realize that everything in life is kind of not as bad as it may seem.
“I haven’t felt this good since 
I was 10 years old probably, so it’s pretty sweet.”
