With the general election a few months 
away, tens of thousands of Alachua County 
residents cast their votes Aug. 14 in this year’s primary election.
Out of the 152,746 registered voters in the 
county , 34,632, or 22.67 percent, cast ballots for local, state and congressional races.
The percent of voters who came to the polls 
hovered in the high-20 percents on both sides Primaries 
set tone for general election

NOT INCLUDED IN THE DISCOUNT.

Students can save while buying books 
today.
UF bookstores will give students a 7 percent discount on all new and used 
books. However, books for rent and books bought online are not discounted.
The sale will be at the bookstores in 
the Reitz Union, Health Science Center and College of Veterinary Medicine. The Levin College of Law bookstore had its sale Monday.  
Student Government partnered with the 
bookstores to promote the discount day for the past two years, said Action SG Chair-man Sean Quinn. He said the discount has saved students more than $50,000 total.
In 2007, students began receiving a 6.25 
percent discount when buying books on the ﬁ  rst day of classes, said UF Bookstores Director Lynne Vaughan. This amount corresponded to Florida’s sales tax.
But when the bookstores changed com-
puter systems, they needed to input a whole number, so they rounded the dis-count up to 7 percent.
Vaughan said she knows books can be 
expensive, but she thinks this discount will help students.  
“We can’t do it all the time,” she said. 
“But we can do it once a year.”

presiding over the weekly Senate meetings.
Senate President Pro Tempore Logan Harrison an-
nounced Price’s resignation via email Monday.
The Senate will elect its new president at an emergency 
meeting at 5 p.m. Thursday in Room 355B at the Levin Col-
lege of Law.
Harrison will serve as acting president until a new one 
is chosen.In a phone interview, Harrison said he was notiﬁ  ed by 
administration about Price’s resignation.
Price did not comment on why he re-
signed but said he was grateful for the experience.
“It was an amazing opportunity,” he 
said.
Price’s term was set to expire in Sep-
tember, according to the Student Govern-ment website. He had been Senate presi-
dent since March.During his term, he enacted a Senate speaker series in-
viting university and community leaders to discuss diver-sity at UF. Price also formed committees on anti-hate and sustainability.
Prior to his term as Senate president, Price was the judi-
ciary committee chairman.
“I want to personally thank Aundre for his dedication 
and service to our university,” Harrison wrote in the email. “On behalf of myself and everyone in Student Government, I wish Aundre the best in all of his future endeavors.”

Tropical Storm Isaac forms; Fla. 
may be in track
MIAMI — Forecasters say 
Tropical Storm Isaac has formed in 
the Atlantic with a track that could take it toward Florida where the Republican National Convention will be held next week.
Storm warnings were issued 
Tuesday across a swath of islands in the Caribbean, including Mar -
tinique, Guadeloupe and St. Mar -
tin.
The National Hurricane Center Richard Brown, of Taunton , 
said he went into Gulf Taunton 
recently and asked for a $5 “Blue Ice 7s” ticket, but the clerk was distracted and instead gave him a “Sizzlin 7s” ticket.
Brown selected the cash option 
on the prize and received a one-time lump-sum payment of about $430,000 after taxes. He plans to use the money for a new roof on his home and to take a trip to San Francisco.
The store gets a $10,000 com-
mission.

Like NASA rover, family switches 
over to Mars time
LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE, 
Calif. — One California family of 
five is learning what it’s like to live on “Mars time” this summer.
NASA flight engineer David 
Oh had to switch to Martian time after the rover Curiosity landed on Mars early this month. His wife and three children decided to tag along to see what it is like.
A day on Mars is about 40 min-
utes longer than an Earth day, so they’ve been waking up, sleeping and eating at odd hours. One day last week, breakfast was at 3 p.m.
Every mission to Mars, hun-
dreds of NASA scientists and en-gineers at the Jet Propulsion Labo-ratory make the time change for three months, but it’s unusual for an entire family to join in. The kids will be on Mars time for about a month.
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSsays Isaac has maximum sus-
tained winds near 40 mph but is expected to strengthen.
The storm is about 500 miles 
east of Guadeloupe and is mov-ing west near 17 mph.

Your ad here? NY brothers pro-
mote toilet paper ads
RYE BROOK, N.Y . — Two 
brothers from a New York City 
suburb have an advertising con-cept that’s on a roll — a roll of toilet paper.
Bryan and Jordan Silverman 
are creators of toilet tissue print-ed with ads, and sometimes with coupon codes that can be read by cellphones. The Journal-News  said in a story Sunday that the brothers expect their product to appear this fall in the Port Ches-ter-Rye Brook Public Library.
Jordan Silverman, 22, came 
up with the idea for Star Toilet Paper in 2010. His 18-year-old brother tells the newspaper that he was initially skeptical but came to see it as advertising to “a really captive audience.”
The brothers from Rye Brook 
have entered their concept in a contest run by Entrepreneur magazine.

Mass. man gets ‘wrong’ lottery 
ticket, wins $1 million
BRAINTREE, Mass. — When 
a store clerk gave a Massachu-
setts man a scratch-off lottery ticket different from what he asked for, he didn’t make a big deal about the mistake; he said he just “rolled with it.”
It was a good decision: He 
won $1 million.

� THE FATHER IS IN “CRITICALLY STABLE” CONDITION.
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Writer
Gainesville Police arrested a man accused of beating his dis-
abled father and leaving him on the ground for three days.
Police charged David Roland Bickford, 53, of 4002 NW 31st 
Terrace, with aggravated abuse of an elderly or disabled adult.
According to a GPD arrest report, Bickford and his father, 
David Mowat Bickford, 72, got into an argument Friday at their 
house. During the fight, Bickford picked up his father’s wheel-chair and dumped him on the ground.
He then punched his father in the chest, grabbed and 
wrenched his nose, kicked him in the stomach and ground the father’s hand into the floor with his foot. Bickford then left his father lying on the ground.
At about 8:30 a.m. Monday , the father’s caregiver, Sheryl 
Baer, arrived at the house to check on him. She found the father unresponsive and lying in a puddle of his own urine. 
Baer told Bickford to call for help. He refused, but eventually 
called 911 after Baer threatened to call police.
She asked Bickford how long his father had been on the 
ground. Since Friday, he replied. She then asked how long he had planned to leave his father on the floor.
“Until he was dead!” he said, according to the report.After police arrested him Monday, Bickford denied throw-
ing his father out of the wheelchair. The father was taken to North Florida Regional Medical Center later Monday , and a hospital spokeswoman said Tuesday that he is in “critically stable” condition.
Police booked Bickford into Alachua County Jail on Mon-
day, where he remained Tuesday with a $15,000 bond.

UF’s size can make it hard to ﬁ  nd friends.
With about 50,000 students scattered across 
a 2,000-acre campus, some people struggle to ﬁ  nd groups with which they identify.
But a new social platform aims to cut down 
on awkward dining hall introductions.
AtThePool.com will launch at UF Aug. 27. 
Students can make free online proﬁ  les and join themed “pools” that connect them with like-minded strangers.
The creator, Alex Capecelatro, knows how 
tough it can be to meet new people. He at-tended the University of California, Los An-geles for four years before meeting another student who shared his passion for BMX.
After college, he began searching for new 
friends online but didn’t have much luck with conventional social networks.
“Facebook is good for connecting with 
people we know,” he said. “but it’s really bad to meet new people.”
So Capecelatro set out to create a service 
that would encourage users to break out of their normal social circles.
In July, he and a team of designers and de-
velopers released At The Pool.“The Pool is a way to say, ‘Here’s the type 
of people I want to meet,’” Capecelatro said.
Users can personalize their accounts by 
choosing their interests, uploading photos and narrowing who they want to meet based on gender and relationship status.
At The Pool automatically introduces 
members each day . 
Students can also browse recommended 
connections and see activities to do with other members.
Users from more than 45 countries have 
registered since the website’s debut. Now, Capecelatro will focus on concentrating mem-bership geographically.
This fall will be the ﬁ  rst time students can 
ofﬁ  cially join an At The Pool network desig-nated for their university. UF is one of the ﬁ  rst schools the site will feature.
UF students can request an invite by vis-
iting AtThePool.com and entering “UF” as their code.

After a rainy day at school, Gary Solo-
mon was hungry for some French fries. 
His appetite went up in smoke Tuesday when an unattended cooking pot caused a grease ﬁ  re in his kitchen.
At about 3:30 p.m., Gary , 16, got back 
to his house at 17 NE 18th St. He heated a pot on the stove then went to his room to change clothes.
Solomon’s mother, Alicia Solomon 
Burch, 31, was in her bedroom watching “Law & Order” when she noticed smoke coming from the kitchen.
She called for Gary to check the kitch-
en, gathered her daughters and left the house.
“I got up and got my important papers 
and was telling my girls to come out the back door, because I already saw that it was bad,” she said.
Solomon and his stepfather, Stanley 
Brown, 45, went into the room to clear out the smoke and tried to get rid of the pot.
Solomon wafted the smoke with a 
towel as Brown sprayed the stove with a ﬁ  re extinguisher.
“It had a big blaze,” Brown said. “Like 
the whole house was on ﬁ  re.”
Gary and Brown got out of the house 
as Solomon Burch waited outside in a tent with her daughters.
Gainesville Fire Rescue responded  at 
about 3:45 p.m. GFR District Chief Rich-ard Saulsberry said no one was injured.
Outside in the tent, Kelly DeRasmo, a 
GFR ﬁ  re investigator, told the family the ﬁ  re did little damage to the kitchen.
“It could have been a lot worse,” she 
said.

National voter turnout increased marginally from 2010 primary
of the political aisle. Republican races in Alachua County saw 
a 29 percent turnout with 12,814 registered residents voting. In the Democratic race, turnout was 26.3 percent with 19,946 vot-ers going to the polls, Election Chief Deputy Will Boyett said. 
These elections were bumped up from the end of August 
to Aug. 14 because the state Legislature wanted to make sure the Republican National Convention, which begins Monday in Tampa, wouldn’t get in the way of the primary elections, among other reasons, said Supervisor of Elections Pam Car -
penter.
Voter turnout countrywide showed a 0.5 percent increase 
from 2010’s primary election.
In the Republican race for the Alachua County Commis-
sion District 1 seat, John Martin pulled ahead of Kevin Riordan and Brandon Kutner with 5,135 votes to win the spot. Cur -rent Commissioner Mike Byerly won against Roberta Lopez with 11,217 votes to clinch the Democratic county commission race.
Martin and Byerly will face off for the District 1 seat in the 
Nov. 6 general election.
For the Alachua County School Board District 4 seat, can-
didate Leanetta McNealy and incumbent Barbara Sharpe re-ceived 12,493 and 10,864 votes respectively. Because the school board election is nonpartisan, Sharpe or McNealy needs 50 percent or more of the votes to claim the seat. A runoff election will be held in November.
Robert “Hutch” Hutchinson and Ken Cornell went head to 
head for the Democratic County Commission District 3 seat. Hutchinson won with 11,150 votes, and he will face former County Commissioner Jean Calderwood in November.
Ted Yoho, a Gainesville veterinarian and Tea Party mem-
ber, defeated U.S. Rep. Clifford Stearns with 5,406 votes, or 45.51 percent, in the U.S. Congressional District 3 election. Stearns, a 20-year Congress veteran, conceded to Yoho on Aug. 15.
For the second time in two elections, Ed Crapo defeated 
Alonzo V . Perkins for the Alachua County property appraiser position. Crapo secured another four-year term.
In the race for U.S. Senator, Connie Mack won the Repub-
lican vote with 661,341 votes statewide over Mike McCalister, Marielena Stuart and Dave Weldon. In Alachua County, Mack took 7,462 votes, or 62.91 percent. For the Democratic race, in-cumbent Bill Nelson defeated Glenn A. Burkett with 698,886 votes statewide. Countywide, Nelson pulled 80.05 percent, or 15,502, of the votes.
For winners of  the Republican and Democratic races, the 
fight isn’t over yet. Candidates will begin to campaign for the upcoming Nov. 6 general election.

Warm smiles awaited soaked families as 
they sprinted into the Broward Hall lobby 
to avoid a monsoon Friday afternoon.
UF Student Body President Tj Villamil 
and UF Board of Trustees member Alan Levine greeted new students and their families during residence hall move-in day with cold bottles of water and words of welcome and advice.
Move-in day had a personal signifi-cance for Villamil, who will graduate this spring.
“It’s bittersweet,” he said. “You’re ex-
cited to see all of these new people here, but you don’t want to leave.”
The duo visited Broward, Beaty and 
Jennings Halls and a handful of other resi-dence halls in a golf cart. Levine stopped the cart every time he saw someone walk-ing, leaned out and offered the soaked pe-destrians water.
“I know how it feels,” Levine said.He still remembers when he dropped off his son at the university five years ago, a scene that, he said, was much more chaotic 
than it was on Friday.
“I’m happy to see how 
much effort UF goes to to make it a smoother and 
more enjoyable experi-ence for families,” he said.
Other veterans of the 
move-in rush agreed that 
the process has vastly improved.
Kelly Korman, a women’s studies grad-uate student who has been a student resi-dent assistant for five years, said her fresh-man move-in was stressful for her whole family.
“That day was chaos,” Korman said. 
“Now it’s much more organized, and we have less panicked parents.”
Harry Beisswenger, who dropped off 
his daughter Bridget at Broward Hall, said he was glad to see that administrators were willing to welcome him and his fam-ily to UF.
“Everyone has been helpful and accom-
modating,” Beisswenger said, “but the rain is another story.”

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Did you have a good summer?
115 TOTAL VOTES66% YES
34% NOAug. 15 question: Do you feel prepared 
for college? 
New Year, New Leaf
Try new things in 
college
Welcome home, Gators.
Most of you are returning, and we’re glad to have 
you back.
But about 6,500 of you are brand-new freshmen, and it’s 
probably your first time away from home.
The freedom of your first semester of college can be over -
whelming. No one is telling you where to be or what to do. 
There are no curfews, no dress codes, no detention or hall pass-es.
For some, this will translate to many nights spent wander -
ing Midtown and a lot of missed morning lectures.
Enjoy it. Turlington Hall isn’t the only place where you can 
get an education. And don’t let your professors scare you — get-ting a B in your 1000-level psychology class isn’t going to sink your GPA. There are more important lessons to learn here.
Everyone will tell you that college is what you make of it, 
and that’s true.
During your time at UF, you might find your life’s calling 
in medicine, politics or activism. Or you might end up with a dual degree in botany and Russian, because those were the only classes you liked.
You might even decide that UF isn’t for you — and that’s 
OK, too.
Either way, don’t be afraid to chase your passions. There’s 
no magical combination of classes that will result in a guaran-teed job offer upon graduation, so you might as well do some exploring along the way.
UF offers more than 100 majors, and there are close to a 1,000 
student organizations, most of which meet on campus.
Now is the time to take yourself out of your comfort zone 
and try something new.
If you get invited to an ultimate Frisbee tournament, a hu-
la-hoop jam, a vegan Thanksgiving feast, underwater hockey practice or a Hare Krishna drum circle, go. Say yes to any new experience you can, within reason. (If someone invites you to a Juggalo festival in rural North Central Florida, it’s OK to po-litely decline, and then unfriend him or her on Facebook.)
The goal is to be able to say, at the end of your first year 
of college, that you did something, saw something or learned something interesting outside of a classroom.
Of course, don’t forget to hit the books now and then — fail-
ing that 1000-level psychology class will definitely sink your GPA.
And don’t worry if college isn’t all it’s cracked up to be at 
first. In the next few weeks, you’ll probably get sick, have a fight with your roommate and fail an exam. You’ll also prob-ably go to a couple parties, be genuinely interested in at least one of your classes and see the Gators win a football game.
It’s all part of the experience, and it’s all necessary. You’ll get 
into the swing of things soon.
Just don’t forget to call home on the weekends. Your mom 
misses you.College is like a trip to Taco Bell
I am as surprised as you are to see my byline in this pa-
per again. Believe me.
My columnist application was a sincere love letter 
to my editor. I got an email congratulating me on my se-lection as a columnist in reply. Is that flirting?
To the freshmen reading my writing for the first time, 
welcome! Hopefully you’ll come to be regular readers and feel closer to me than the effervescent guy who works the night shift at the Taco Bell on Archer Road (To find out why that is funny, Google “Skambis Defecation Proclama-tion”).
It is to you, freshman class, that I address this column. 
Feel special. There is a strange set of phenomena that you are about to witness in the coming days. I offer you this field guide for navigating the start-of-school biome.
Girls will start wearing brightly colored dresses and 
oversized plumage, prancing about with their arms be-hind their backs and dying their hair blond (even when blond doesn’t quite suit their complexion). This is an ill-ness by the name of “Really Unnerving Sorority Hubbub” (or RUSH).
From my observations, it seems to last about a week, af-
ter which the girls receive envelopes that either cure them of the illness (which involves crying), or causes the ailment to become permanent (which involves squealing).
You’ll also start to see very approachable-looking Prot-
estants standing along the major walkways outside of the major dorms, bearing toothy grins and cold bottles of wa-ter. You may not at first realize that they are Protestants, but all the signs are there. If you accept the water, they’re going to want to tell you about a barbecue, or bonfire or something with some contests and free food.
Attend these gatherings at your own peril. At first they 
seem like innocuous fun, but then you’ve got a plate of food and suddenly people start talking about Jesus. I can tell you not many things are more uncomfortable than a surprise Jesus talk. It’s like ordering a Cheesy Gordita Crunch only to receive a Cheese Roll-Up.The major political party 
representatives will also be on campus assaulting you until you register to vote — as they damn well should! It’s ridiculous how lazy and self-absorbed our gen-eration is when it comes to vot-ing. If a majority of students in Florida had voted back in 2010, we might not be stuck with Rick 
Scott right now. That’s how close that race was.
(And if you’re going to use one of the campus organiza-
tions for voter registration, use the Democrats. They have more students working for them than the Republicans.)
You’ll also meet people (usually girls) who will openly 
say they oppose drinking alcohol underage for moral rea-sons. They’ll say things like, “Why would anyone want to alter his/her mental state? That’s just stupid” making any passerby being treated for a psychiatric condition feel awkward. When encountering these people, pelt them with copies of “The Great Gatsby” or “Crime and Pun-ishment.” Both are equally effective at repelling them and their inability to differentiate between morality and the law.
The Unite Party in Student Government is a political 
boss machine run by the rich folk in Greek life. The party’s methods of winning elections are pretty unethical — and no one except this newspaper’s staff cares.
And lastly, stop buying clickers. Those infernal contrap-
tions cost way too much money, don’t transfer over from class to class, and are used mostly to create an audience for bad lecturers. If everyone stopped buying them, pro-fessors would have no choice but to stop requiring them. Seriously, the power is yours.
Hope you all have a better year at UF than our football 
team will.

Letters to the Editor
Presidential Candidate Gary Johnson deserves attention
There is a storm brewing in America that will rock the world 
if it gets any worse. Americans are at the breaking point with 
a bad economy, corrupt banks and bought-out government of-ﬁ  cials.
Trillions of dollars have been sucked out of the middle class 
and into the bank accounts of a privileged few. Americans are threatening to revolt at the ballot box. Make no mistake about it, people are angry, and they are not going to take the two-party system anymore.
In this time, as many are calling the “year of the Libertarian,” 
people are taking a second look at a system that worked for so many years, allowing individuals to remain free to choose their own paths and live free of massive, bloated government.
Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson now car-
ries the banner for those oppressed by corruption, debt and injustice.The former governor of New Mexico never raised taxes, 
and he vetoed more bad legislation than all other governors combined in his eight years. Buckle your seat belts, America, for there is a new man in town who is here to topple a very corrupt system.

Alligator misses the mark on Mars story
I was on campus yesterday and picked up a copy of the Alli-
gator, which had a story on the cover titled “NASA sends rover to Mars, awes students.” This is good because students don’t know or care much about space ﬂ  ight.
However, the third paragraph of the story gave the U.S. 
space effort a little more credit than it deserves. The story stat-ed, “A U.S. rover the size of a small car landed safely on Mars at 1:31 a.m. Eastern time Monday before heading back to Earth.”
Wow. A “Mars return” mission. I thought that was years 
away!
The article goes on to say “Curiosity is the world’s second 
spacecraft to land on Mars. The ﬁ  rst was a 1971 Soviet Union rover that stopped working shortly after landing.”
Actually , 14 spacecraft, out of 40 attempts, have landed on 
Mars. But it is 14.
It’s kind of mind boggling — not just that an ignorant writer 
should be given the assignment, but also that no one else who read the story knew enough about space ﬂ  ight to stop her. How many editors and copy editors looked at it?
Ah, well. When Martian overlords show up to enslave us 
for our ignorance, maybe the writer and editors of the Alligator will be offered supervisory jobs.

Hi, friends. My name is Erin Jester, and I’m 
your editor this semester. This will be my ﬁ  fth 
Fall semester in Gainesville, and after I gradu-ate in December, I plan to continue working in newspapers. I don’t have much free time anymore — being an editor is a full-time job 
— but when I do, I enjoy going to ska shows and the beach, reading mid-20th century British and American literature, singing along with old Joni Mitchell re-cords, rolling around the living room ﬂ  oor 
with my dog and cats and practicing modern dance. If you have an idea or complaint, or you just want to chat, shoot me an email at ejester@alligator.org. I’d love to hear from you.
Erin Jester
EditorHey, all! I’m Sarah Kinonen, your man-
aging editor for the Fall semester. I’ve worked for the Alligator for about a year now as a copy editor and then as the copy desk chief. A little bit about myself: I am a hard-core feminist who loves cats. I also 
enjoy exercising, reading Jezebel on a daily basis, trying new local restaurants and drinking Karma Cream lattes. When I graduate, I’d love to work for a publication 
that caters to all (or most) of these interests. Until then, I’m ﬁ  nishing up my ﬁ  nal year at UF as a journalism major. If you’d like to chat, complain or pitch a story, feel free to give me a shout at skinonen@alligator.org.

Fan Day Frenzy

Fan Day at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
� IT WILL BE DISPLAYED AT 
UF FOR FIVE YEARS. 
SHELBY WEBB

Gainesville is home to a new 
record-breaking reptile — but it’s 
not an alligator.
Researchers with the Florida 
Museum of Natural History dis-sected a 17-foot-7-inch Burmese python Aug. 10, the largest of its kind ever found in the state. The 164.5-pounder was pregnant with 87 eggs and broke previous state records for pythons.
“This thing is monstrous; it’s 
about a foot wide,” Florida Muse-um herpetology collection manag-er Kenneth Krysko said in a press release. Krysko was out of town and unavailable for an interview.
The Florida Museum received 
the specimen from the Everglades National Park as part of a U.S. De-partment of the Interior project researching methods for manag-ing Florida’s invasive Burmese python problem, according to the release.
After the scientists complete 
their investigation, the museum will display the snake for about five years. Then it will return to the Everglades for more exhibi-tion.Museum biologist Rob Robins 
said athough the snake is well within the average length of the species, the fact that they are grow-ing to be so large in their non-na-tive environment is troubling.
“They’re very cryptic and 
well-camouflaged, so there could be bigger ones out there,” Robins said.
The longest Burmese python 
previously found in Florida mea-sured 16.8 feet. Another was preg-nant with 85 eggs.
The spike in python popula-
tion led the state to pass a series of laws regarding the snakes. It’s illegal to own them as pets or to transport them across state lines without a federal permit.
People can hunt the pythons 
in certain areas in some spring months if they have a hunting li-cense and required permits.
At UF, researchers examined 
the snake’s stomach, which con-tained feathers that will be iden-tified by museum ornithologists. The pythons’ prey can include birds, deer, bobcats and alligators.
By inspecting the snake and the 
contents of its stomach, research-ers hope to learn more about the elusive reptile and how to stop the snakes from spreading.

SAVE THE RACKS

� THEY MUST BE REMOVED BY AUG. 15.
ERIN JESTER
Alligator Staff Writer
UF administrators have de-
manded the Alligator remove 
19 of its orange newspaper racks from some of the most visible parts of campus.
On July 3, the Alligator re-
ceived an email from Amy Hass, UF associate vice president, stat-ing the racks must be removed by Aug. 15.
On Dec. 11, 2009, without con-
tacting the Alligator, UF’s Board of Trustees approved a rule that would prohibit distribution of all publications on campus unless ap-proved by the UF vice president for business affairs, according to information provided by Alligator attorney Thomas Julin.
Around the same time, a plan 
was drafted to remove privately owned news racks and to replace them with modular racks. Pub-lishers who wished to continue distribution on campus would have to sign a licensing agreement and lease space in the university-owned black modular racks.
UF did eventually notify the 
Alligator and other publishers of the plan in Fall 2010, after the university bought several of the modular racks and started placing them on campus.
Alligator representatives ob-
jected, noting the change could hurt distribution and that the lease is an unfair tax on free speech.
During a July 2011 meeting 
between Alligator representatives and UF administrators, admin-istrators denied the plan would hurt readership or violate rights, but they allowed the Alligator to conduct an impact study.
The Alligator collected data on 
the orange racks during Fall 2011, and replaced five with modular racks in Spring 2012 to measure differences in distribution.
At the end of the Spring semes-
ter, the Alligator presented its data to retired professor David Den-slow and asked him to determine if the change to modular racks would impact distribution.
On July 3, before Denslow 
could finish his analysis, UF ad-vised the Alligator it would con-tinue with its plan, regardless of the unfinished study.
“We’re disappointed that the 
university has been unwilling to wait for the results of a serious study of the actions it proposes,” Julin said.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said the university wants to move forward and is willing to work with the Alligator.
“The door is open,” she said.The Alligator launched a cam-
paign against the changes July 19 at alligator.org/savetheracks.

UF demands Alligator racks removal
Editor’s Note: A version of this 
story originally ran on alligator.org on Aug. 10.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer
UF has decided to postpone the 
removal of 19 newspaper racks 
until Jan. 6.
Earlier this week, the universi-
ty informed the Alligator it would continue the rack removal planned for Aug. 15, forcing the Alligator either to move into university-owned racks or not distribute on UF’s central campus.
Alligator attorney Tom Julin 
filed an immediate injunction and a complaint against the univer -
sity after finding out the deadline would not be postponed.
But because of the postpone-ment, Julin said the judge does not need to rule on the injunction before Aug. 15. However, a per -
manent injunction and a lawsuit are still pending.
He said this will give the paper 
and the university time to work on a mutual agreement.
“Before that date arrives, we 
would have reached a solution that is satisfactory to everyone,” Julin said.
The university believes the Alli-
gator has no basis for the lawsuit.
“But, if the Alligator chooses to 
litigate, we will defend vigorous-ly ,” a university statement said. 
UF informed Julin on Aug. 9 it 
would waive the required fee to be in the modular units. This decision was decided before the lawsuit, according to the statement.

More than seven hours after 
starting an all-day rehearsal, the UF 
Fightin’ Gator Marching Band brass section was still picking up speed.
The band departed July 16 for 
London, where they will perform July 27 before the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics and other venues this week. 
“It can be really overwhelming 
and draining,” said Rene Mark, 23, former tuba section leader and re-cent UF graduate. “But marching season is so far away that we really do need the time to put on the music … it’s a lot to take in.”
It was the first time all 216 mem-
bers of the marching band making the trip had met to rehearse together since receiving their sheet music in April.
The set list contains almost a foot-ball season’s worth of music, said Gator band director Jay Watkins.
“The drum majors or the direc-
tors can call up anything at anytime during the show,” Mark said. “You just have to know it and be ready to play it.”
Watkins remained confident in 
the students’ preparedness. 
“They’re used to playing in front 
of 90,000 people up close and per -
sonal,” Watkins said.  “I think we’re just moving to a different stage.”
The marching band’s journey to 
London began about a year and a half ago, according to Watkins. 
The band’s official invitation to 
play the London Live pre-show to the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremonies came at the end of last September.
“For a majority of the world this 
is going to be the first time they see the University of Florida,” Watkins said. “We’re the true ambassadors.”
The expenses of the trip cost 
about $4,000 per student, totaling almost $1 million to send the 216 members and band staff. Watkins said the initial count dropped by about 10 percent because of the trip’s cost.
”I wasn’t sure if it was going to 
happen,” Mark said. 
Mark sent emails to Gator clubs, asked other Gators for donations and started a fundraising website to meet her goal.
“To be able to take the band 
abroad and share it with people who probably haven’t had a typi-cal marching band experience is ex-hilarating,” she said. “It’s something very unique to the SEC and America in general.”WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 11

The dreams of about 800,000 undocumented students won’t 
be deferred, but their deportations will.
The Obama administration said June 15 it will grant a two-year protection from deportation to undocumented students 
who were brought to the United States before the age of 16 and 
allow them to apply for work permits.
The students must earn a U.S. high 
school diploma or a GED, or serve in the military , among other criteria. 
The policy is an adaptation of the 
DREAM Act, which was killed in Con-
gress in 2010.
Victor Yengle, president of Coalition of Hispanics Integrat-ing Spanish Speakers through Advocacy and Service, or CHIS-PAS, was brought to the U.S. at the age of 12. 
When he was accepted to UF in 2009, Yengle was expected 
to pay international tuition.
“You feel like you’re in the door, and you can see the other 
side, but you’re not able to step in,” he said.
Yengle, 23, established his permanent residency two years 
later, allowing him to fulfill his dream of being a Gator.
“People were saying, ‘I’m going to be able to have a driver’s 
license for the first time,’” he said.Adapted DREAM Act will benefit undocumented studentsEditor’s Note: A version of this

Jon Silman failed the first as-
signment he turned in to his fu-
ture mentor.
Kelley Benham thought the 
Fall 2010 magazine and feature writing article was “A” material, but then she found a misspelled name.
One fact error means an “F” 
for UF journalism students.
Silman, a Santa Fe College 
transfer, redid the article and won Benham over.
Almost two years later, the 
Tampa Bay Times enterprise edi-tor found herself awake at 2 a.m. on June 8 to hear that Silman, 29, won the National Writing Cham-pionship of the Hearst Journal-ism Awards Program in San Fran-cisco.
He wasn’t the only Gator who 
did. Telecommunication senior Steven Gallo, 20, placed first in radio broadcast news. Eight students in each of the five cat-egories competed for the college version of the Pulitzers and the $5,000 prizes.
Silman said his reward is get-
ting to report as his job. He in-terned for a year and worked at the Alligator. Now he is a cops reporter at the Gainesville Sun.
“I love it so much, I don’t mind 
waking up at 7:30,” he said.
A profile about a widow who 
learned her late husband was gay landed him a finalist position in April.
Gallo got his spot with a fea-
ture about an opera-singing chef in Italy and a news story about the execution of convicted mur -derer Manuel Valle.
Gallo, who has worked with 
WUFT’s radio and television sta-tions, was able to interview the son of the police officer Valle was convicted of killing. That story also won him national awards with the Society of Professional Journalists and the Radio Televi-sion Digital News Association.
Shortly before Gallo arrived 
in San Francisco, he learned he’d be reporting on technology and privacy. He narrowed the topic to focus on how San Francisco po-lice used cameras to scan nearby license plates.
He had less than two days to 
report and about one to compile and edit.
“It’s kind of like being pushed 
out of a plane with a parachute in a city — and for me an entire state and a coastline — that I’ve never been to before and being told to do a story in a day,” he said.
But knowing that he could do 
it was empowering, he said. It gives him hope for his internship with an NBC affiliate television station and his future career.
Donna Green-Townsend, fea-
tures unit executive producer at WUFT-FM, said Gallo has the ability to get people to talk and a tireless work ethic.
She’s seen Gallo work in every 
WUFT position he could.
This experience is what Green-
Townsend thinks makes the dif-ference for students.
“This is not just a little news 
lab,” she said. “This is the real deal.”Contact Clare Lennon at clennon@alligator.org. 12, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22, 2012

Burned pizza wasn’t on the menu at 
Satchel’s Pizza, but that’s what customers 
were talking about as they stood in a line that snaked alongside the building.
People began lining up Friday at 10:20 
a.m. for the 11 a.m. opening, eager to get their hands on a slice of Gainesville legend. Satchel’s Pizza opened its doors again Fri-day after a February fire closed the restau-rant for three and a half months.
“It’s nice to be back open,” said Satchel 
Raye, owner of Satchel’s. “It’s been so hard getting everything back together.”
A burned pizza salvaged from the fire 
is now enshrined in one of the restaurant’s clear-topped tables.
Raye estimates he spent between $150,000 
and $200,000 on repairs to the kitchen, which is the area that caught fire in February.
The Gainesville community was ready to 
help.
Part of that response was a show hosted 
by High Dive (formally known as Double Down Live) on March 14. All benefits from the show went to Satchel’s employees, who had to find odd jobs while the restaurant was closed. Raye also set up an IndieGoGo donation Web page for his employees, and the $20,000 goal was reached in 24 hours.
“People are all so excited,” Raye said. 
“We’ve had an overwhelming response — it’s been great.”
Workers spent 18-hour days trying to re-
model and fix the burned restaurant. They added an extra oven and a new pizza station as a part of the renovations.
Raye said the city was great with helping 
the process along and that the contractors he hired were great, but he’s glad the process is over.
“The whole fun is having people eating,” 
Raye said. “We don’t know how to build — we know how to feed people.”
The first of those in line to be fed was 
Chet LaBarr, 41, and his two teacup chihua-hua-mix puppies.
“They probably weren’t even alive when 
this place was opened last,” LaBarr said.
He said he was shocked when he first 
heard of the fire from a co-worker at UF’s College of Medicine. 
The creativity and artistic quirkiness are 
part of why LaBarr said he loves Satchel’s, aside from the food.
LaBarr lined up in front of Satchel’s 40 
minutes before the doors were set to open, something he planned on doing for weeks.
“I wanted to patronize the poor people 
who have been out of work for the past few weeks,” LaBarr said.

For Crystal Durham, not taking out a 
loan wasn’t an option.
Financial aid covered tuition and hous-
ing, but she had other expenses during her 
first semester at UF.
“I didn’t have any money to actually eat 
with,” she said.She ended up taking out a loan for a 
little more than $2,000 during her first se-mester, and another for about $2,700 last spring.
Durham, a 21-year-old computer en-
gineering senior, is one of 7.4 million students who will benefit from a bill ap-proved by Congress on June 29 that allows the interest rate on student loans to remain at 3.4 percent instead of doubling.
In 2007, Congress allowed the interest 
rate on Stafford loans to drop from 6.8 per -
cent to 3.4 percent over five years.
If no additional agreement was reached 
this year, the loan rate would’ve returned to 6.8 percent effective Sunday. The deal will be renegotiated next summer.
The $6.7 billion deal will be financed by 
changes to federal pension insurance.
According to Tim Mason, president of 
Florida College Democrats, students with federal loans will save an average of $1,000 a year at the lower rate.
The debate about whether to raise the 
interest rate was really a discussion about furthering higher education and helping students pay for their futures, Mason said.
“People ought not to have to mortgage their future to invest in it,” he said.
Not all university students will be able 
to benefit from the loan deal.
A budget compromise passed last year 
included a provision disqualifying gradu-ate students from receiving subsidized loans. Mason doesn’t anticipate movement on the issue.
Durham said she was relieved to hear 
about the loan rate staying at 3.4 percent for now.
She said if the rate doubled, she would 
worry about how to pay off her loans quickly. With the deal, she’ll pay at a steady rate, with less anxiety.
“There’s not as much of a sense of ur -
gency to pay it off,” she said.

Chris Joyce woke up early in the 
morning in the worst pain he had 
ever experienced.
He crawled out of bed and tried 
to massage out what he thought was a cramp. Then he saw the blood.
What Joyce didn’t know was that 
a 9mm bullet had traveled through the wall of his 2nd Avenue Centre apartment early July 9 and lodged itself in his left leg.
The wound bled through a dress-
ing Joyce, a 20-year-old political sci-ence and philosophy junior, made from a First Aid kit. He called his father, a trauma surgeon in Punta Gorda, and wrapped a towel around his leg to try to stop the bleeding.
The pain didn’t subside, so he 
went to the inﬁ  rmary at about 9 a.m.
After the ﬁ  rst set of X-rays, doc-
tors told Joyce they had to take some 
more scans because they found shrapnel in his leg. He was shocked.
Joyce was 
transferred to the emergency room at Shands at UF and questioned by a detective. Police would later take out a section of a wall to determine the type of bullet.
Joyce said Gainesville Police 
learned a security guard’s gun ac-cidentally discharged in the room next to Joyce’s.
The security ofﬁ  cer confessed to 
police, but police withheld his name because the investigation is ongo-ing.
Joyce said he wasn’t planning on 
pressing charges and was undecided about any other legal action.
About a half hour after Joyce was 
shot, a security guard knocked on his door, asking about a noise. Joyce ﬁ  gured the guard just heard him scream.
Doctors said the bullet missed his 
important nerves, blood vessels and bones.
They left the bullet because it was 
embedded deep in the muscle.
Now, Joyce said, the process of 
recovery begins. He has since moved out of his apartment.
He said he was disappointed by 
the security guard’s delayed reac-tion to the shooting.
On July 13, 2nd Avenue Centre 
property manager Scott Orphan re-leased this statement:“Relating to an incident that oc-
curred on 7/9/12 near 2nd Ave Centre, there were no employees or residents involved. The incident in-volved a security ofﬁ  cer from One Global Security who accidentally discharged a ﬁ  rearm.”
Both Joyce and his 24-year-old 
sister, Elyse,are just glad he escaped with minor injuries.
“He deﬁ  nitely has a guardian an-
gel in that room,” she said.16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22, 2012

The Student Senate passed 
a bill to limit when candidates 
and political parties can cam-paign for Student Government elections during a May 22 meet-ing. It also redeﬁ  ned campaign-ing.
The bill needs to be ap-
proved by the Senate for a sec-ond time to be enacted.
The revisions proposed 
campaigning start one week before elections and end when the polls close.
“Campaigning” would be 
redeﬁ  ned to encompass elec-tion-speciﬁ  c material that so-licits support for a candidate or party.
However, the revisions also 
added “campaign activity” to the codes, which is intentional action or support of a party or candidate that does not so-licit votes. Campaign activity would start four weeks before the election and end when the polls close.
The revisions also added 
Internet posts as an example of campaign material.
“You have to make it ac-
countable to a party,” said Ju-diciary Committee Chairman Cayman Weimer. 
Sen. Lauren Verno, one of 
the bill’s authors, said it would bring more bipartisanship by allowing senators to focus on the Senate as a whole instead of campaigning.
“We represent over 50,000 
students as a chamber,” she said. “This is helping the bipar-tisanship of Student Govern-ment.”
Senate President Pro Tem-
pore Logan Harrison, another author, said his job encourages unbiased decisions, and this bill would allow him to remain im-partial instead of campaigning for his particular party.
Sen. Matt Pesek said who-
ever has the free time to cam-paign should have the liberty to do so.
“If we have more than 
one week [to campaign], we wouldn’t have to have armies of people harassing people at 
Turlington,” 
he said.
D u r i n g 
the meet-ing, the Senate also approved  Robert An-drade, Dan-iel DiMatteo, 
Michael Hacker, Brett Halperin and Cole Sullivan as new Su-preme Court Justices.
DiMatteo sparked debate 
because he knew about hazing that resulted with his fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi, being kicked off campus four years ago. DiMat-teo phoned in during the Sen-ate meeting and said he knew hazing had occurred and fol-lowed appropriate channels by reporting it to the fraternity administration.

Students looking to get their bi-
cycles fixed will have to push them a 
little farther than the bushes outside of the Reitz Union Colonnade, but they might break less of a sweat.
UF’s Free Bike Repair opened in a 
new location June 11, moving into the Reitz Union and its air conditioning.
The new location is in the same 
room as the Outfitter, on the ground floor of the Reitz Union.
“No one wants to stand out in the 
sun,” said Jackie Matthews, Free Bike Repair coordinator.
Funding for the relocation came 
from Student Government. 
The new location has a new bike 
rack, a new air compressor and adapters attached to the exterior of the building, Matthews said.
The adapters will allow students 
to fill up their tires any time — even when the bike repair is closed.
Daniel Harcha, a 22-year old me-
chanical engineering senior and man-ager of Free Bike Repair, said bike re-pair hours will be shortened for the rest of summer to Monday, Thursday and Friday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. 
Free Bike Repair will be open five 
days a week this fall.

The U.S. Supreme Court 
upheld the national health 
care plan pushed by President Barack Obama and Congres-sional Democrats.
Under the Affordable Care 
Act, U.S. citizens must pur -
chase health insurance or face a penalty . The law also lets states expand their Medicaid programs for sick and low-income Americans and sets up state exchanges for people to compare policies.
The Supreme Court upheld 
it after ruling the penalty for not buying insurance is a tax.
The Court ruled that the 
mandate does not fall within Congress’ power to regulate interstate commerce, a provi-sion Chief Justice John Rob-erts required after that defense was presented.
“The Government’s logic 
would justify a mandatory purchase to solve almost any problem,” Roberts wrote in the Court’s majority opinion.
Florida and 25 other states 
filed the lawsuit.
Gov . Rick Scott has said 
he will not e x p a n d Medicaid  or set up a state health insurance exchange.
Allyson 
Hall, assis-tant profes-
sor and research director for UF Center for Medicaid and the Uninsured, said UF stu-dents benefit from being al-lowed to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26.
If a student’s parents don’t 
have health insurance, he or she can shop for a policy or qualify for Medicare if the stu-dent is at up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line.
Hall said if Scott does not 
set up an exchange, the federal government will. She sees it as a step forward.
“I think it’s the best law 
they could’ve gotten,” she said.
UF College Democrats 
President Billy Farrell, a 20-year-old environmental science junior, called it “an amazing decision.”
But to 21-year-old political 
science and telecommunica-tion senior Katy Melchiorre, it means lost rights.
Melchiorre, who is the 
chairwoman of the UF Col-lege Republicans, sees the act as unconstitutional.
“I do not think it is the 
government’s place to require me to purchase a product or service and punish me with a higher tax if I don’t,” she said.

Two new orange and blue Regional Tran-
sit Service buses will be driving through campus beginning in August.
On the Plaza of the Americas on Wednes-
day, RTS unveiled its new biodiesel hybrid buses that will start running Aug. 19.
The new buses will run on route 46, 
which goes from UF to downtown, said RTS Marketing and Communications Supervisor Chip Skinner.
The electric and biodiesel combination 
increases fuel efficiency by 20 to 30 percent.
The buses start on the electric battery and 
the diesel fuel kicks in at certain speeds.
Skinner didn’t know the exact speeds, but he said the system works like a hybrid car.
The buses cost $600,000 each, Skinner 
said.
Curtis Reynolds, UF’s vice president for 
business affairs, said the Campus Develop-ment Agreement, which facilitates coordi-nation between UF, Alachua County and Gainesville, funded the buses.
During the unveiling, Reynolds said 
these buses strengthen the university’s part-nership with RTS.
RTS will be the sec-
ond agency to use biod-iesel hybrid buses. The 
first is the Palm Tran in Palm Beach County, Skinner said.
“It’s been a number of years in the works,” 
Skinner said.
Three more hybrid buses will be coming 
in spring.

UF’s Board of Trustees elected 
a new chairman just in time to 
put his name on spring gradu-ates’ diplomas.
Board of Trustees vice chair -man David Brown, a 1973 UF alumnus and chairman of Broad and Cassel law firm, was elected on May 3.
The board had until May 4 to 
select a replacement for former chairman Carlos Alfonso, who served on the Board of Trust-ees for 11 years and resigned on April 23. 
His term would have expired 
June 30, 2013.
“I couldn’t be more happy or more thrilled about the leader -
ship we are possibly selecting,” 
Trustee Alan 
Levine said pri-or to the vote.
Brown is tak-
ing over at a critical time for the university. 
Last month, 
the governor 
approved a statewide budget that cut $38.2 million from UF, which the board will vote on later this month.
Brown recognized that wins 
and losses during the legislative session have left the board with numerous challenges in front of it.
“I think that we all can expect 
to have extra responsibilities placed upon us in the coming-months and in the next year,” he said.
Marshall Criser III, president of AT&T in Florida and son of former UF President Marshall Criser Jr., was elected vice chair -
man.
The board also welcomed 
new Student Body President Tj Villamil and thanked outgoing Faculty Senate Chairman Scott Nygren for his service. 
Cheri Brodeur is the new 
chairwoman as of June 1.

Diane McFarlin spent most of 
her adult life on the road between 
Sarasota and Gainesville, but for now she’s here to stay.
McFarlin, publisher of the Sara-
sota Herald-Tribune and a 1976 alumna of UF’s College of Jour -
nalism and Communications, was selected as the new dean of the college.
“I just could not be prouder to 
be named dean of a school that is already so distinguished,” she said.
As of Jan. 1, McFarlin will suc-
ceed John Wright, who served as interim dean since July 2006 and was named permanent dean in December 2007.  
As dean, McFarlin said she 
hopes to help manage partnerships with stakeholders in the college and explore multimedia opportu-nities, including the 21st Century Newsroom in Weimer Hall.
“We extend a hearty welcome 
to Diane,” advertising chairman John Sutherland wrote in an email. “She has the experience, expertise and leadership ability to help us continue our pursuit of excel-lence.”
Unlike other candidates for the 
dean’s position, McFarlin doesn’t hold a master’s degree or a Ph.D.
When she was nominated, her first question was whether UF would consider someone without advanced degrees.
“My whole career has been in 
the profession,” she said.
However, she said, half of 
the top 10 journalism schools in the U.S. have deans whose back-grounds are in their profession, not academia.
She said this trend is indicative 
of current challenges in the field — the face of journalism is chang-ing, and colleges want leaders who have experience dealing with those problems.
McFarlin also thinks UF was 
looking for a dean with leadership experience.
As former executive editor of 
the Gainesville Sun, president of the American Society of News-paper Editors and managing edi-tor and publisher of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, she said, “I know what comes with a position like that, both the respect and the great reward.”
Mike Foley, a professor in the 
journalism department, thinks it was a bold decision.
“She’s not your traditional aca-
demic,” he said. “She’s the con-summate professional.”
After graduating from UF in 
1976, McFarlin started her ca-reer as a reporter for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, where she was named managing editor by the time she was 31.
She left to become executive 
editor of the Gainesville Sun in 1987 but returned to the Herald-Tribune three years later as execu-tive editor. McFarlin has been the publisher of the Herald-Tribune since 1999.
Foley, who has known McFar -
lin for more than 25 years, said the selection comes at the right time for her and the college, which is ready to help pass her experience to students.
“We continue to try to make 
sure that we are preparing stu-dents for the brave new world of journalism, and she’s on the front lines,” Foley said.
Under McFarlin’s direction, the 
Sarasota Herald-Tribune launched a 24-hour cable news channel in 1995, one of the first of its kind.
Although McFarlin’s primary 
background is in print media, tele-communications chairman David Ostroff said he’s glad she has some experience with television.
“It’s going to be a learning 
curve for all of us,” he said.
Ostroff said all of the candi-
dates were told the college is in dire need of more faculty. He’s looking forward to expanding in that respect, as well as working with the dean to enhance the grad-uate multimedia program and the TV production facilities.
“We’re delighted to have some-
body that already has a great feel-ing for the college,” he said.  
McFarlin will stay with the 
Herald-Tribune for another three weeks. Then she  plans to travel, making visits to other journalism programs and attending confer -
ences to prepare herself for her new job with the Gator Nation.
She’s looking forward to get-ting to know the faculty and stu-dents and welcomes the challenge of leading one of the top journal-ism schools in the country.“I am happiest when I’m on the 
learning curve,” she said.

The Student Senate passed two amended 
budgets, which included giving about $250,000 
extra to Student Government Productions.
The Activity and Service fee budget pro-
posed to reduce funding for SG staff salaries and special events and to add to SGP and com-puter network support.
Budget and Appropriations Committee 
Chairwoman Christina Bonarrigo said SGP re-quested more funding because artist fees and venue prices increased.
Sen. Matt Pesek opposed the additional 
$253,522 given to SGP , which he said has not been fiscally responsible in the past.
“I have not been given any specifics what 
this money is going to go to,” Sen. Morgan Vollrath said. “I can’t sign off on it.”
However, Sen. Lauren V erno said giving 
money to SGP is giving money to the students because all SGP events are for the students.
The revised budget also allocated $100,000 
from SG to help keep Library West open 24 hours during weekdays in the Fall and Spring semesters.
The senators passed an amended SG-fund-
ed academics budget, which lowered the Fine Arts College Council budget by $3,522.
Six performance groups that used to be 
funded by the college council are now funded by the School of Music, said Rodriguez.
“We were actually able to save money this 
year,” Bonarrigo said.

Students can now add Amazon.
com to the list of websites to scour 
when comparing prices for text-book rentals.Amazon, which already sells and 
buys textbooks, launched a textbook rental program Aug. 6, according to a press release.
Students can now rent textbooks 
and have them shipped to their doors or opt for a Kindle eTextbook rental.
All rentals are eligible for free 
standard shipping on orders of $25 or more as well as free two-day shipping with Amazon Prime.College students can also sign 
up for Amazon Student, a free 
membership program with benefits such as six months of free two-day shipping and 
email alerts with discounts.
The membership covers two-day 
shipping on products including vid-eo games, CDs, phones and Kindles, the company said in the release.
“College is expensive, and stu-
dents are always looking for ways to save money on textbooks, which is why we’ve long offered great prices on both new and used textbooks,” Ripley MacDonald, director of text-books at Amazon.com Inc., said in a statement.
Amazon’s pre-existing textbook 
trade-in program allows users to sell books or trade them in for Ama-zon.com credit.
Heather Halak, an 18-year-old 
English and journalism sophomore, has bought textbooks from Ama-zon before. She said the assurance Amazon Student provides with free two-day shipping on most orders is helpful.
“I know that in three days, a 
package will be at my door,” she said.
But Halak said she wouldn’t rent 
from the online retailer.
“When the class is over, you 
can just sell your textbooks back, whereas if you rent textbooks, you don’t get any of that money back,” she said.

TUTORING

A lot has changed since Tutor-
ingZone started helping UF stu-
dents get through their classes in 1999.
Faced with competition and a 
market dominated by online learn-ing, the veteran study service is moving closer to campus and will be streaming lessons live.  
TutoringZone is moving from 
North Main Street to about ﬁ  ve new locations, said general man-ager Alek Hartzog.
More students came to tutoring 
sessions after the company put its material online about a year ago, he said. The current building is not big enough.  
TutoringZone serves 5,000 to 
7,000 UF students each semester, owner Matt Hintze said.
It’s in competition with Study 
Edge, another tutoring company in Gainesville. 
In June 2011, nine TutoringZone 
tutors left to start Study Edge.
Hintze said he feels he offers 
competitive tutoring services. 
He said competition beneﬁ  ts 
students by forcing both compa-nies to provide better services.
“I think it’s critical that the stu-
dents are always the winners in this,” he said.
TutoringZone will stream its 
lessons live online, he said.
The study service is opening re-
cording studios in the New Hori-zons Computer Learning Centers.
“We are deﬁ  nitely going to con-
tinue to innovate with what we do online,” he said.
The company’s goal is to give 
students more learning tools on-line than they can get in a class-room setting, he said. However, students can still attend lessons in person.
TutoringZone serves UF, Florida 
State University and Indiana Uni-versity. Hintze mentioned plans to expand to another school in the fall but would not say which one.
The company’s expansion 
doesn’t include hiring more tutors, he said. It currently employs nine full-time tutors.
Hintze said students should try 
different services and then decide which service is best for them.  
“Competition’s good — every-
one runs faster when they’re being chased,” he said.Tutoring-

In an area of Florida dotted with 
mom ‘n’ pop barbecue restaurants, 
thousands of people flocked to Gainesville’s most commercial street Aug. 1 for fried chicken.
They specifically chose Chick-
fil-A to show their support for the restaurant chain and the company’s public stance against gay marriage.
When Chick-fil-A President Dan 
Cathy told the Baptist Press in a July 16 article that he is “guilty as charged” of supporting the Bible’s heterosexual definition of marriage, backlash and boycotts followed.
It doesn’t seem fair to Jerry Nash, 
a minister at Cornerstone Baptist Church in Fort White. It’s about people being able to say what they want, he said.
“All of a sudden that’s hate 
speech? That’s perversion and per -
version of free speech,” he said.
Chick-fil-A supporters in the 
public eye also made a case for the chain. Former Republican presiden-tial candidate and Fox News host Mike Huckabee followed Cathy’s announcement by proclaiming Aug. 1 as “Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day.”
Although the company released 
a statement that declined to com-ment on sales figures, customers and orders seemed to spike. The Archer Road restaurant usually fills about 1,600 orders each day . On Aug. 1, supervisor Ricky Delaney said 2,520 orders were placed. The restaurant in the Oaks Mall served a crowd that flooded the food court and trickled between the tables.Cars piled up in the drive-thru 
line at the Archer Road restaurant, wrapping around the building and splitting into segments that stood still for minutes.
Mitt Romney campaigners used 
this to go from car to car, asking pa-trons to sign up as campaign volun-teers.
Kasey Greenhalgh, a 23-year-
old UF telecommunication senior, interns for the campaign and was called out to help when her manager needed an extra set of hands. He’d signed up 50 people in 30 minutes.
“We’re just trying to help support 
[the] people with traditional values who came out,” she said.
Teri Bracewell, 37, of Hawthorne, 
scoped out the parking lot and found a close spot to claim a kid’s meal. She heard about Chick-fil-A Appre-ciation Day through her church, Liv-ing Hope Family Worship Center in Florahome. 
“I support the fact that they 
support the Bible, and the Word says man and woman, traditional,” Bracewell said.
For Christina Holland, 39, of 
Alachua, the meal was supporting freedom of speech and religion. Her 15-year-old daughter, Sierra, made a statement to the company.
About 10 members of the Nation-
al Organization for Women stood in front of the restaurant, waving at cars and holding signs with slogans like “Homophobia should never be on the menu.” 
Robbin Cochran, vice president 
of the organization’s Gainesville area chapter, said the group respects the rights of Chick-fil-A and its sup-porters to freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
But Cochran, a 29-year-old Santa 
Fe College astronomy student, said that idea goes both ways.
“By the same token, we have our 
First Amendment right to respond and freedom from their religion,” she said.

Students are drawn to free stuff like 
Lindsay Lohan is to a rehab clinic.
Now, UF students will be able to 
take advantage of hundreds of dollars’ 
worth of free software through UF In-formation Technology and software distribution company e-academy.
The free software includes Microsoft 
Office 2007, Microsoft Office 2010, Mi-crosoft Office for Mac 2011 and Micro-soft Windows 7 Upgrade.
“UFIT negotiated this partnership 
to provide [Microsoft] Office to all stu-dents, so that is one less expense stu-dents have to think about and budget for,” Tracy Gale, communications man-ager for UF Information Technology, wrote in an email.
This is the first time Microsoft or 
any other widely used software pack-age has been made available to all stu-dents for free, she said.
Students do not have to visit the 
bookstore or the Hub to download the software, Gale said. 
The software can be downloaded 
from anywhere.
The software will be available to 
students into the foreseeable future. There is no end date for the program, she said.
Although this offer is not available 
for faculty and staff, they can still buy the software at reduced prices from the UF Computing Help Desk, Gale said.
Students can download the soft-
ware at the e-academy online portal at http://charges.helpdesk.ufl.edu/e-academy/.
Matt Brooks, a 23-year-old criminol-
ogy senior, said it’s nice of the adminis-tration to offer the software for free.
Students pay a lot of money for tu-
ition and books and helping them out by providing important software for free is good, he said.

sure,” he said.Microsoft products free for

A new online program designed to 
quickly register students to vote saw a suc-
cessful unveiling June 13.
The program, TurboVote, also alerts stu-
dents by sending email and text reminders about election deadlines. Students can then request absentee ballots from their local election authorities.
Some of them have already started.“More than 300 individuals have already 
accessed the system,” said Shelby Taylor, digital communications director for the Bob Graham Center for Public Service at UF.
Students will be mailed their voter reg-
istration or absentee ballot form. TurboVote completes the form and mails it with a post-age-paid, pre-addressed envelope.
The creator of the program, Harvard’s 
Kennedy School of Government alumnus Seth Flaxman, likened the program to Net-flix.
UF will be the fourth university in Flori-
da to host TurboVote, following Florida In-ternational University, Miami-Dade College and University of Miami.
The Graham Center gathered enough 
donations to cover all costs of the program, Taylor said.
“There isn’t a cost for students,” she said. 
“[The department has] already taken care of that for them.”
Students can sign up for the service at 
http://ufl.turbovote.org.
Taylor said TurboVote hopes to  create a 
10 percent increase in the number of ballots cast by voters in the age bracket of 18 to 29 this year.
According to a 2009 Project Vote report 
on voter participation in the 2008 elections, fewer than half of 18-year-old citizens were registered to vote.
Alex Kerrigan, a 19-year-old finance 
sophomore, would have fallen into that sta-tistic. He said he was still waiting to register to vote.
“I don’t care about it until it’s the presi-
dential election,” he said.
But Kerrigan said receiving email and 
text alerts about election dates would en-courage him to participate in more elec-tions.
“If I knew about it every time I got a text, 
I would vote in the election,” he said.New voting program allows UF

UF’s Board of Trustees has ap-
proved a $2 per credit hour increase 
to a fee that will help fund renova-tions to the Reitz Union.
In March, the board approved the $50 million expansion of the stu-dent union, to be financed through bonds, and a $25 million renova-tion, $20 million of which would be funded by the Capital Improvement Trust Fund.
Although the fund was initially 
expected to yield $20 million, the Board of Governors recently let UF know the available amount in the fund was only $4.9 million.
To make up the difference, trust-
ees voted Monday to adjust the CITF fee by $2, increasing the fee from 
$4.76 to $6.76 per credit hour 
for undergradu-ates only. The fee hasn’t increased in 30 years.
Student Body 
President Tj Vil-lamil noted that raising the CITF 
fee is in keeping with the board’s promise to not create new fees to fund renovations to the Reitz Union.
Money from the CITF fee is col-
lected from state universities and released by the Board of Governors every three to five years, depending on the needs of the universities.
Kratzer said he was surprised the 
trust fund fell so short this cycle.
“All along when I proposed this, 
I didn’t think we’d have to do this,” he said.
UF needs the full $20 million to be able to complete the renovations all at once. Although projects on campus are usually completed in multiple phases, he said, it would be more efficient to finish the proj-ect in one phase because the build-ing is used year-round for a variety of purposes, unlike most classroom buildings.
Otherwise, he said, “You’re actu-
ally paying for that twice.”

UF junior Matthew Feldman broke the Guinness World Record 
for five-ball joggling at Rice University on July 27.

He doesn’t stop and he rarely 
drops.
Multitasking master Matthew 
Feldman simultaneously jogged 
and juggled his way to victory on July 27 when he broke a Guinness World Record for five-ball joggling one mile at the Rice University track in Houston.
Beating the 1989 record of seven 
minutes, 41 seconds, Feldman, a 20-year-old UF electrical engineer -
ing junior, ousted American joggler Bill Gillen from the books with a time of six minutes, 33 seconds.
“Every throw when you’re run-
ning with five balls is difficult. You’re basically juggling and your feet are following,” Feldman said.
His best practice time is six min-
utes, 27 seconds — six seconds fast-er than his time Friday. 
And he wants to shave those 
seconds off.
“I’ll probably make another at-
tempt at some point in the future and try to improve my record,” Feldman said.
Dropping one of the orange 
Russian-style balls adds five to 10 seconds to his time. 
In practice, Feldman has joggled 
without any drops, but in front of spectators and media on July 27, he had three.
“You want to go faster out of 
being nervous, and when there’s a crowd there, juggling and running at the same time kind of conflict,” he said.
In addition to breaking the 
world record, Feldman joggled to raise money for a community he recently visited in Japan that was affected by last year’s tsunami.
His goal is to raise $2,500 this 
year through his website, www.thejugglingrunner.com, for a com-munity in Minamisanriku.
The UF juggling club, Objects in 
Motion, cheered Feldman on from Gainesville. President Zak Bedell, a 20-year-
old civil engineering junior, said he knew Feldman could do it.  
“He’s inspired some of us in 
Objects in Motion to take up our joggling balls and run with him,” Bedell said, “sometimes only to be left in his path.”
Feldman motivates club mem-
bers and teaches them new tricks and techniques, Bedell said.
Before Friday, Feldman’s name 
was already in Guinness’ book.
He’s set two other records for 
five-ball joggling: 400 meters in one minute and 10 seconds and 5,000 meters in 27 minutes and six sec-onds.
There’s only one distance he 
hasn’t set the mark for: 100 meters.
“It’s taken a lot of practice,” 
Feldman said. “But I kept working at it.”
He’ll keep joggling, but his fu-
ture is up in the air. 
He’s taking the fall semester off 
for an internship at SpaceX — a platform that will launch him to his more professional ambition — be-coming an astronaut.
Until then, he’s quietly awaken-
ing the world to the sport of jog-gling.
“He lets his juggling balls do 
the talking,” Bedell said. “He’s jug-gling his life, and I don’t know how he does it all.”UF student breaks world joggling record

the 23-year-old telecommunica-tion production graduate said. “One million subscribers is the goal.”
His videos have already been 
well-received. Known for their humor and spot-on impressions, his weekly videos cover many topics but focus mainly on sports.
One of his most popular vid-eos, Stuff Gator Fans Say, has been featured on Buzzfeed and is full of playful jabs, especially regarding Florida State University. He asks, “If two FSU grads get a divorce, are they still cousins?”
Combined, Magruder’s videos 
have a total of 1.7 million views, but that’s just a drop in the bucket for him.
“I don’t think that’s a lot; it’s 
not a lot to me,” he said. “I have a lot of work to do still.”
The YouTube program he was 
selected for, called Next Creator, launches a series of contests al-most monthly to find new Inter -
net stars. Each contest is searching for a different type of talent – from cooking to relationship advice.
Magruder was selected as a 
vlogger, or video blogger.
He’s focusing his channel 
more on sports now and plans to start a weekly sports show start-ing next Sunday. He described it as ““Tosh.0,” but just sports and much shorter.”
Magruder isn’t the only Gator 
to achieve YouTube fame.
Toby Turner, who also gradu-
ated with a degree in telecom-munication production, has 658,121 subscribers to his channel and more than 150 million video views. He even moved out to Cali-fornia to make his videos as a full-time job.
Even more popular is Glo-
Zell, a musical theater graduate who has almost 200 million video views and has plans to host her own television show.
Magruder hopes to join these 
other Gator YouTube sensations and hopes that UF and the world are ready for his big break.
“Prepare for greatness,” he said 
with a laugh, “because I have so many great videos just waiting to be shot. I’m about to go into full-time beast mode.”

� THE ICHETUCKNEE RIVER MAY TEMPORARILY CLOSE TO THE PUBLIC.
SHELBY WEBB
Alligator Staff Writer
In increasingly dry North Central Florida, lakes are drying and 
springs are predicted to stop flowing. The land is becoming more 
brittle by the week.
The Florida Park Service warned on the Ichetucknee River 
website that “due to extreme drought conditions and historic low water levels in the Ichetucknee River,” there is “potential for oc-casional temporary recreational tubing closures this summer at the park’s North entrance.”
“If things don’t change, we will see more closures,” said Chris 
Bird, Alachua County environmental director.
Bird said he’s been working with the environment in Alachua 
County for 22 years, and he’s never seen water levels this low, especially in the springs.
Poe Springs is at a record low water level, and Bird said the 
county estimated that the spring would stop flowing within the next two weeks, making it unsafe for swimmers.
Once a spring stops flowing, bacteria 
flourishes in the stagnant water.
“It’s like a public swimming pool 
with no chlorine,” Bird said. “The bacteria levels could spike, and swimmers could end up getting sick.”
Ginnie Springs isn’t in danger of having its flow stopped, most-
ly because it draws water from a much larger area, Bird said.
There are two main causes for the lack of water: a statewide 
drought and overpumping of aquifers.
On average, each Floridian uses about 155 gallons of water 
each day, Bird said. About half of that water is used for watering yards.
Without enough rainfall to replenish the water people use, lev-
els have fallen unusually low.
UF associate professor Taylor Stein said another issue facing 
recreational bodies of water during a drought is overcrowding.
Despite possible warnings, Stein said students may still flock 
to at least one of the springs, even if it is closed to swimmers.
“People go to Ginnie to party more often,” Stein said, laugh-
ing. “They might be just as happy sitting on the side drinking beer as they would be in the water.”

In collared blue shirts and head-
gear, the brains of NASA’s mission 
control center gripped their seats, staring into computer screens. They were quiet those last five sec-onds, desperate to make history.
“Touchdown confirmed,” the 
announcer said, and silence gave way to celebration.  
A U.S. rover the size of a small 
car landed safely on Mars at 1:31 a.m. Eastern time Aug. 6 before heading back to Earth.
“This landing is a stunning 
achievement for the American space program,” said Rick Lind, an associate professor in the depart-ment of mechanical and aerospace engineering.
Lind said he thinks landing the 
rover on Mars was the most tech-nologically challenging project the country has undertaken in de-cades. The total cost of the project was about $2.5 billion, according to the New York Times.
“The timing and precision are 
hard enough to comprehend, but imagine doing it fully autonomous without any human oversight in an environment where you can’t pre-dict with total certainty the winds or temperature or air conditions,” he said.
Lind predicts the exploration 
spearheaded by Curiosity will con-tinue for several years.
Aerospace engineering junior 
Jorge Bartra, 20, described the in-tensity of watching the landing in the Springs Hall library.
“I was holding tight to my seat,” 
he laughed.
He said the images taken by the 
rover and its smooth take-off back to Earth suggest a successful mis-sion.
“It looked like it landed per-
fect,” he said.
Bartra is part of a UF team par-
ticipating in the NASA Lunabot-ics Mining Competition. His team is working on a fully automatic robot to extract minerals from the moon’s surface.
“It gives us huge encourage-
ment to make a great product for next year,” he said.
Santa Fe College environmental 
science junior Charlie Wilson, 22, caught some of the landing on tele-vision. He said it was intriguing to watch mission control center scien-tists directing the landing and that it seemed like a stressful task.       
“I’m really excited to see what 
science experiments they’re going to do on Mars,” he said.WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 27

A nationwide search for the 
new vice president of student 
affairs ended where it began.
Dave Kratzer, who has 
served as the interim vice presi-dent for student affairs since April 1, 2011, was officially named to the position May 18.
“I am deeply honored to be 
given this opportunity ,” Kratzer said. “I think it’s important — and our staff will remember ev-ery day — that student affairs begins with students.”
Kratzer took over the in-terim position after Patricia Telles-Irvin left UF last year to become the vice president for student affairs at Northwestern University.
Kratzer served as the asso-
ciate vice president for student affairs from 2005 to 2011.
Kratzer has advocated for 
campus projects that improve student welfare, including the expansion and renovation of the Reitz Union and the imple-mentation of the “U Matter, We Care” campaign.
Student Body President 
Tj Villamil said Student Gov-ernment is extremely pleased with the selection and believes Kratzer will continue to work well with the Student Body.
“It’s a great success for the 
students,” Villamil said.

It all started when the running 
shoes began to pile up in Jillian 
Roberts’ closet.
Now, Roberts is a part of the 
international 8,000-member team that will carry the Olympic torch through the U.K. and end at the opening ceremony July 27.
As a cross-country and track 
runner at Miami’s Coral Reef High School, Roberts, a 19-year-old UF communication sciences and disorders sophomore, ran right through her blue Asics sneakers.
But the pile in the back of her 
closet five years ago has grown to 8,700, which is the number of shoes she has collected and do-nated to One World Running, a Boulder, Colo.-based project that collects and cleans shoes for the world’s shoeless.
“Any shoe,” Roberts said. 
“You name it, I’ve collected it.”
She said 
she got new sneakers  
about every six months but didn’t want to trash the old pairs. One day, she said, she wondered why she didn’t collect her old shoes for those who are less fortunate.
Jillian Roberts’ sister Emily 
Roberts, a 20-year-old UF commu-nication sciences and disorders and psychology senior, nominat-ed her sister to be a torchbearer.
She was chosen by Coca-Cola 
to be one of 22 American torch-bearers, including ice skater Michelle Kwan and swimmer Summer Sanders, both former Olympians.
Jillian Roberts will run with 
the Olympic torch for 300 meters, which is about three and a half football fields long, on July 10 in Slough, England, a town between Oxford and London.
Coca-Cola will pay for the sis-
ters to stay in Oxford July 9 to 11.
Jillian Roberts said she remem-
bers crowding around the living room television at home with her sisters, younger brother and par -
ents to watch the Olympics ever since she was young and can’t wait to experience it firsthand.
“I still am in shock. Like, this is 
for real,” Jillian Roberts said. “It’s something that I am only going to be able to do once in my life, and I’m going to look back on my past in 20 or 30 years from now and feel proud of myself.”28, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22, 2012

� HE HAD PLANNED TO RESIGN IN OCTOBER.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer
The Florida A&M University Board of Trustees decided 
at an emergency meeting July 16 that President James Am-
mons will step down from his position immediately.
Last week, Ammons announced his plan to resign in Oc-
tober after a hazing death and other issues.
The board agreed to pay Ammons his 2010-2011 bonus of 
$81,250. Due to his contract, the board will also pay him a 2011-2012 bonus of $17,062, according to a press release.
In June, eight board members announced they had no 
confidence in Ammons as president.  
FAMU has been under public scrutiny for months after 
drum major Robert Champion, 26, was beaten to death in a hazing incident. The university also faced an investigation of 
fraud in the band’s finances and issues with accreditation, according to Alligator archives.
FAMU Provost Larry Robinson will as-
sume the role.
“I am grateful for this opportunity to 
serve at this critical time in the university’s history,” Rob-inson said in a statement. “There is work to be done and I stand ready to do my absolute best to keep FAMU on its path of success. During this period, I look forward to serv-ing our students, faculty, staff, alumni and supporters.”
The board must confirm Robinson’s appointment at its 
next scheduled meeting in August.

WIDE RECEIVERS
By JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Florida’s wide receivers were virtually  non-
existent much of last season. 
Now, even though the unit is nearly identi-
cal to what it was a year ago, expectations are 
significantly higher.
It wasn’t a wide receiver that led UF in recep-
tions last year, but departed running back Chris Rainey, who finished with 31. For the wideouts to replace not only his production but also im-prove on a disappointing 2011 performance, someone will have to step up.  
Offensive coordinator Brent Pease said the 
Gators receivers have the ability to do so.
“There is game-changing talent,” Pease said. 
“We have speed and guys that can stretch the field. There are some that are getting more confi-dent that can do that naturally.”
Deonte Thompson led all UF wide receivers 
in catches in 2011 with just 21. No other South-eastern Conference wide receiver who led his team in catches had fewer than 30, and six of them had more than 50. 
Coaches are hoping Quinton Dunbar takes a 
step forward to try to buck that trend. Dunbar re-ceived high praise from both coaches and team-mates during spring practice as a redshirt fresh-man in 2011, but he made just 14 catches for 216 yards and two touchdowns last fall. He caught only four passes for 34 yards in SEC games.
When asked early in fall camp who he thought 
the best receiver had been to that point, sopho-more cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy was blunt with his response.
“Quinton Dunbar because he’s fast and he 
can get open,” Purifoy said.
During Saturday’s open practice, Dunbar 
showed off his athletic ability with two catches of more than 40 yards on plays in which Jeff Driskel threw the ball behind him, forcing him 
to come back and make a leap-ing grab.
Pease said he would like to 
have six to eight wideouts he is confident in by the SEC opener at Texas A&M on Sept. 8. With the Gators returning only 
Dunbar, Frankie Hammond Jr., Solomon Patton and An-dre Debose as receivers who 
caught passes in 2011, there is plenty of room for someone to emerge. Still, Pease said each has to earn his playing time.
“They create their roles and what they can do 
for us,” he said.

There was no doubt that Taylor 
Brauneis was Louisville’s domi-
nant setter for the last two years. The junior led the team with 1,100 assists in 2010, and continued her top performance in 2011 when she was responsible for 85 percent of the Cardinals’ assists. 
With the Gators’ top two set-
ters gone for the 2012 season, Brauneis picked the perfect time to transfer to Florida.
“There is a confidence level, and she plays with so much game,” coach Mary Wise said. “We talk about the greatest play-ers and so many of them have a high IQ of the game, and that’s what Taylor has.”
Brauneis should have no prob-
lem picking up the slack from Florida’s two departing setters. Not only was she just 125 assists shy of Kelly Murphy and Chanel Brown’s combined total last year, but had she been a Gator in 2011, Brauneis would have been third in service aces and fourth in digs.
Wise and players like Tan-gerine Wiggs are excited about Brauneis’ addition because of her talent and ability to run a 5-1 of-
fense, something Florida hasn’t 
done since 2007.
“It is so great 
to have Taylor coming from a successful pro-gram and the experience she has,” Wiggs 
said. “She has run a 5-1 offense, and we have only run a 6-2 in the past couple of years, so having someone come with the experi-ence of running a 5-1, it is so dif-ferent. Having Taylor is huge. It is something that puts us a step ahead.” 
The main difference between a 
5-1 offense and a 6-2 offense is the number of setters a team has on the court. In the 5-1 there’s only one setter, as opposed to two set-ters in a 6-2. 
Because Brauneis has only 
played in a 6-2 once in her en-tire volleyball career, the Gators will spend more time in the 5-1 scheme this season. Since transferring in January, 
Brauneis has had to learn how to adjust to the new coaches, play-ers and tempo. However, she said she’s up to the challenge of filling the shoes of the setters who’ve left Florida.
“I was here for the spring and 
I had to learn a couple of new things, but I think when summer started, I was a Gator,” Brauneis said. “I want to win a national championship, and I think here, I can do that.”

After the Gators spent last sea-
son learning rather than commu-
nicating, defensive coordinator Dan Quinn has coaching compe-tition in Year 2 of his system.
Older players, such as senior 
linebacker Jon Bostic, have be-come their own coaches on the field.
“The communication is a lot 
better, because the first year the wording was pretty long,” Bostic said. “For us being in the second year in the defense, we’re al-lowed to cut those words down a little bit shorter, because now we know what each other is think-ing. 
“We can just look at some-
body and pretty much know, ‘OK yeah, I see what you’re seeing.’ It makes us a lot better as a defense, because we play a lot faster and get the calls in quicker.”
Gators coaches held split 
squad practices this fall to divide reps and separate the inexperi-enced players from the veterans. 
Now, players such as redshirt 
freshman safety Valdez Showers can make the same calls as start-ing safety Matt Elam. 
Showers needed the practice 
experience to get comfortable. 
“Coming into a new system 
like that, you’re so worried about being in the right call that you forget about making plays on the ball,” Showers said.
Coach Will Muschamp arrived 
at Florida wanting a “ball-hawk-ing” defense that could generate turnovers. 
Nationally, the Gators finished 
113th of 120 teams in turnover margin. Players who were trying to learn the terminology rather than making plays are now com-fortable enough to react, meaning Quinn was able to focus on cre-ating turnovers during training camp.
“You’ve heard the saying, 
‘You get what you emphasize,’” Quinn said. “I’ve really tried to hit it as hard as I can.”
Even after a good practice, 
turnovers are emphasized. 
“I still went back to the take-
aways,” Quinn said. “‘We had one today, that’s not enough,’ and tried to make that emphasis. I’m going to continue to do that in hopes to improve in that area.”
Muschamp gave his team a 
different, more potent, message during an October four-game los-ing streak, one he hoped would fuel the Gators this offseason.
“Don’t ever forget the feeling,” 
Muschamp said. “I told them that in the locker room after the games. There is a key to every kid and it’s your job as a coach to find the key. I know one thing. Em-barrassment and failure are huge motivators for competitors.”
Players say the failure of last 
season has led to improved com-munication.
“After practice, guys are stay-
ing to help each other out with the different things they need to work on,” Omar Hunter said. “This team’s just so much togeth-er right now.”

cus@alligator.org.

Last year, the Gators had five 
seniors in their starting lineup. 
Among those five were All-Amer -
icans Kelly Murphy and Kristy Jaeckel, who accounted for 43 per -
cent of Florida’s kills, 47 percent of assists and 48 percent of the team’s service aces in 2011.
This year, Florida has seven 
freshmen.
“We start this year with a lot of 
new faces,” coach Mary Wise said. “Every team changes year to year, even if you’re just replacing one player, let alone two All-Ameri-cans, five starters and the like. We have a lot of good talent, just not a lot of returning college experi-ence.”
With the core of its team gone, 
Florida is left with three seniors who have to not only fill their shoes, but also lead the newest members. 
However, Wise is confident 
that middle blocker Betsy Smith can handle the pressure.
“The leader of this team, and 
there is no question, is Betsy Smith,” Wise said. “We’ve had some great leaders, but I don’t know if we’ve ever had a player who was just so naturally gifted in that area the way Betsy is. 
“If I had to hand-pick a senior 
to lead a team with so many new players, it would be Betsy.”
Smith is excited to work with 
the freshman class, saying they bring a lot of energy to the court, which is something Florida has been trying to improve. 
However, working with such 
a large group of new players isn’t the biggest change for Smith. In-stead, her biggest jump is becom-ing a more prominent player on the court.
“Last year I could kind of fly 
under the radar with the great se-niors that we had,” Smith said. “I know a lot of us upperclassmen are really going to have to step up and can’t be under the radar any-more.”
Despite their youth and the ab-
sence of the former star players, Wise says the Gators are ready to start their season on Friday.
“There are a lot of unknowns 
about this group, but the knowns are that all 16 of them were all here at the end of June during Summer B and that health-wise, we are in really good shape,” Wise said. “If it were up to them, we’d open up tonight.”

In his second season as Florida’s 
defensive coordinator, Dan Quinn has been focusing on creating more turnovers throughout fall camp. See story, page 30.  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 For the ﬁ  rst time in ﬁ  ve months, 
questions will turn into answers for 
the Gators.
  After spring practice, player-run 
summer workouts and fall training camp, Florida will ﬁ  nally release a depth chart on Monday.
  The Gators held an open prac-
tice on Saturday and a lengthy controlled scrimmage on Sunday . Gators coach Will Muschamp called this past weekend a critical time for his players.
  “We’ve got to start ﬁ  guring out 
where these reps are going,” Mus-champ said. “That includes special teams, offense and defense.”
  The coaching staff held a longer 
meeting than normal on Sunday to discuss where the team stands two weeks from the season opener against Bowling Green. Florida starts preparation for the Falcons on Thursday . 
  Although the coaches didn’t an-
nounce any depth chart decisions, the Sunday night meeting wasn’t for show. 
  “More than anything narrow-
ing down our who is getting reps and then, talking in terms of special teams, who are the guys that we need to be stepping up on special teams for us, especially some of the younger players,” he said. “Where are they ﬁ  guring in as far as snaps and things are concerned? So we feel pretty conﬁ  dent as far as where we’re headed in that direction.”
  The direction Muschamp is 
heading with the starting quarter-back job, however, remains un-clear. Sophomores Jacoby Brissett and Jeff Driskel haven’t separated themselves since spring. Muschamp called the battle the closest one in camp. 
  “At this time, we’ll see what hap-
pens. I’m not ready to comment on that,” Muschamp said. “I think we have a press conference Monday of game week. We’ll see Monday. I don’t know. I’ll make a decision. I’m sitting on some things right now. We still have some time.”
  Muschamp stressed one message 
to his players concerning a starting lineup, and they’ve listened. 
  “We’re reminded every day that 
there is no depth chart,” junior de-fensive tackle Sharrif Floyd said. “There are no starters. There is no second-string. [We’re] just out there competing with each other and we’re out there playing as hard as we can and ﬁ  ghting to get better, more physical and more mentally strong.”
  Still, position battles are being 
fought at many key positions.

The Gators lined up to defend four corner kicks in their 
season opener Friday night. Two of them ended up in the 
back of the net.
Those two corners and a goal resulting from a free kick 
accounted for three of the four goals No. 21 Florida al-lowed in their 4-1 loss to unranked Miami.
“Miami did a terriﬁ  c job of taking advantage of the set 
pieces, and we obviously didn’t do a very good job of de-fending them,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “Their execu-tion was terriﬁ  c and our execution in defending them was very poor.”As a result, the Gators have begun working on set piec-
es more in practice this week.
“I think those things are ﬁ  xable for us, and if it has to 
be exposed, I’d rather have it be exposed early already so we have a chance to ﬁ  x that before we move on,” Burleigh said.Senior forward Erika Tymrak attributed the Gators’ 
failings on defense to top-to-bottom issues.
“The defense starts with the forwards,” she said. “If 
we don’t do our jobs, they can’t do their jobs. It’s not fair to blame anybody for this. It’s not the defense’s fault, it’s the team’s fault.”
Set pieces are an emphasis for Florida moving for-
ward, but Tymrak did not blame those failures alone for the loss.
“It’s just another thing to work on, we’re going to have 
to work on them more in practice, bust that out, and hope-fully it won’t happen again,” Tymrak said. Florida working to improve on set pieces after loss to Miami

for Florida against Bowling Green on Sept. 1?67% BRISSETT
33% DRISKEL
83 total votesPoll Question
Aside from quarterback, which Florida position battle are you most interested in? Vote online at alligatorSports.org.the left and right cornerback spots — 
Marcus Roberson, Jaylen Watkins, Loucheiz Purifoy and Cody Riggs — know they’ll get to play a consid-erable amount this season regardless of how the depth chart shakes out. Florida used its nickel package with five defensive backs on 70 percent of its snaps last season.
Neiron Ball and Darrin Kitch-
ens are working at first-string SAM linebacker alongside Jon Bostic and Jelani Jenkins.
Six running backs have split reps 
as Mike Gillislee’s backup.
These types of decisions will likely 
be easier for Muschamp and his staff to make thanks to a larger sample of practice reps. 
Florida eclipsed 130 snaps in its 
last scrimmage, while injuries and a lack of depth limited the team to, at most, 80 in 2011. 
“I remember last year I set all the 
practice schedules before camp, and then you adjust as it goes based on your numbers, how the team is do-ing, fatigue, whatever the issues are,” Muschamp said. “I’ve had to adjust very little this year as opposed to last year. I had a lot of red ink on the practice schedules.”
No matter whose name sits in the 
top slot for a position, junior center Jonotthan Harrison can’t wait for these “competitions” to end and the Sept. 1 opener to start.
“I’m real excited for it to come,” 
Harrison said. “I’m not going to talk about the depth chart or anything like that. But I’m really excited for this game to come around. I feel like everything is going to mesh together real well.”

Practice for set pieces very physical
Burleigh said Miami brought a lot of physi-
cality to set pieces, which can be difficult to 
replicate in practice.
“The hard thing about defending set pieces 
in training is it’s a very physical, in-your-face type of thing to do,” Burleigh said.
“You risk injury when you do it, but ulti-
mately we’re going to have to throw that in the mix and hope for the best in terms of our players.”
Florida will face two At-
lantic Coast Conference teams 
this weekend, with games against No. 8 North Carolina on Friday and No. 2 Duke on Sunday, teams that will likely play a similar style.
“You’ve got to accept that’s

  Florida’s quarterback competition is silly. 
In fact, the ongoing saga has provided the most ridiculous story coming out of 
the Gators’ fall camp.
  “Jacoby and Jeff are still about 50/50 down 
the middle,” UF coach Will Muschamp said Monday. More like every day.
  Muschamp says nothing consequential. 
New offensive coordinator Brent Pease has kept his lips sealed. Even the players have failed to let any details slip.
  Perhaps the most insane detail regarding 
this asinine PR stunt is that it is simply un-necessary. Jacoby Brissett is the better quarter-back.
  Gasp! I know.  How could a late signee hand-picked by 
Charlie Weis be better than Jeff Driskel, the consensus No. 1 signal-caller in the Class of 2011 and the next Tim Tebow?
  Four words: Where do I begin?  Immediately, toss out the stats (though 
Brissett bested Driskel in most categories last season). Given the circumstances, last year’s numbers don’t really mean much.
  However, how each freshman reacted 
when thrown into the ﬁ  re speaks volumes.
  Brissett had a greater sense of calm in the 
huddle. Recall last season’s loss to LSU. De-spite the enormity of the situation, he never lost his cool. Florida still lost, but at least Bris-sett was not an emotional train wreck.
  Then, there was Driskel’s second half 
against Alabama. Quite frankly, he looked and played as if he was terriﬁ  ed. Granted, the 2011 Crimson Tide defense would scare just about anyone, but you need more gusto to play quar-terback in the Southeastern Conference.
  Coaches took notice. Down the stretch last 
season, which signal-caller did Muschamp turn to when John Brantley missed time with various injuries?  Driskel took his 
last snap of the year against Auburn. Meanwhile, Brissett played in Florida’s ﬁ  nal seven regular-season games.
  Muschamp trust-
ed Brissett under ﬁ  re. 
Driskel was a wild card.
  Fast forward to 2012, and Muschamp has 
suddenly forgotten which guy is battle-tested.
  When Driskel hurt his left shoulder at prac-
tice Aug. 12, it seemed like the act was over. Brissett would ﬁ  nally earn the job he deserves, even if by default.
  However, Muschamp was quick to quell 
speculation, saying on Aug. 15 that “the com-petition is ongoing.”  
  And that brings me to the Gators’ lone 
open practice, held Saturday. Most of Driskel’s throws were dumps to running backs and tight ends. When he went deep, it was not pretty. Overall, he looked skittish in the pocket.
  Brissett, on the other hand, was in com-
mand. He stood strong in the pocket and took chances on deep throws. Granted, he was far from perfect, and it’s silly to put too much stock into one practice. But, comparatively speaking, Brissett looked like the better quar-terback, and he should start Sept. 1.
  Muschamp has his motives for hiding be-
hind the veil of a quarterback competition. Maybe he is trying to avoid a Driskel transfer, in case Brissett suffers an injury. 
  Whatever the reason, the drama has run 
its course. It’s time for Muschamp to name a starting quarterback, and Brissett is the man for the job.
  Florida needs a leader, not a competition.  Contact Joe Morgan at joemorgan@alligator.

� GATORS HAVE ONLY THREE 
HEALTHY TIGHT ENDS.
  By GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Tight end Colin Thompson 
will undergo a second surgery to 
treat a fractured bone in his right foot, sidelining him for about eight weeks. 
  An initial surgery performed 
in the spring to try to resolve the issue did not heal properly, neces-sitating a second procedure, which is expected to happen today. 
  Thompson came to UF as the No. 6 tight end in the class of 2012 and was thought to be in line for signiﬁ  cant playing time because of what he could bring as a blocker at 6 foot 4 and 256 pounds.
  With Jordan Reed missing the 
last week with an MCL sprain and A.C. Leonard leaving the team during the offseason, the Gators are left with only three healthy scholarship tight ends. 
  Former defensive end Tevin 
Westbrook and freshman Kent Taylor have never played the posi-tion for Florida, while Clay Burton appeared in only one game last season. 
  After being held out of contact for a few days because of a shoul-der injury, Sharrif Floyd was back to regular practice on Monday. 
  Lerentee Mc-
Cray was ex-
pected to return to practice on Monday or Tues-day after dealing with a hamstring injury, while M u s c h a m p loosely targeted 
Oct. 1 as the date Ronald Powell can return from a torn ACL he suf-fered during the spring game.   
  Johnson shining on special 
teams: Although he’s been shuf-ﬂ  ed between safety, linebacker and running back in just more than a year with UF, Chris Johnson has found a home on special teams.  
  “Chris, number one, is probably 
our most valuable special teams player,” Muschamp said.
“He’s really an explosive guy 
on special teams and does an aw-ful lot for us there.”
    As conﬁ  dent as Muschamp is in 
what Johnson can do at both run-ning back and fullback, his con-tributions on UF’s punt and kick coverage teams are expected to be even more critical. 
  “Special teams here take pre-
cedence over either offense or de-fense, and our guys understand that,” Muschamp said. 
Demps signs with Pats: Former 
Gators running back and Olympic silver medalist Jeff Demps signed a contract with the New England Patriots on Friday, foregoing a professional track career for a shot at the NFL. 
  “I’m happy, I think that’s 
great,” Muschamp said. “Jeff’s a great guy, and a guy that can certainly be a very valuable third-down back and a returner. He’s a guy that, when he touches the ball, he can take it the distance.”

SUMMER CATCH-UP

Throughout their junior year at UF, Christian 
Taylor and Will Claye were known for ﬁ  nishing 
most meets in ﬁ  rst and second place. The 2012 London Olympics were no different.
At the biggest meet of their track and ﬁ  eld 
careers, Taylor and Claye earned gold and sil-ver in the triple jump. 
“It is awesome,” Claye said. “Christian and I 
have been going 1-2 for a long time. We have a brotherhood, and jumping against your broth-er, you go harder than you do with anyone else. It feels like it is just me and Christian out there sometimes, you know. It is an awesome rivalry, and we deﬁ  nitely push each other and help each other.”
Taylor used a season-best jump of 17.81 me-
ters to secure ﬁ  rst place. Claye was right behind him with his mark of 17.62 meters.
Claye’s triple jump silver was not his ﬁ  rst 
Olympic medal. Four days earlier, he took home the bronze in the long jump. 
Claye’s jump of 8.12 meters secured Florida’s 
ﬁ  rst ﬁ  eld event medal. Claye’s mark also gave the U.S. its ﬁ  rst medal in the long jump since 2004, when Dwight Phillips and John Mofﬁ  tt took gold and silver.
Sprinters Jeff Demps and Tony McQuay 
grabbed silver medals in the 4x100-meter relay and 4x400-meter relay, respectively. After just missing a qualifying spot, Demps 
learned three nights before the opening ceremo-ny that he was chosen to be a part of the 4x100-meter relay pool for Team USA. The last-minute addition came after Mike Rodgers suffered a stress fracture in his left foot. 
Demps ran the ﬁ  rst leg of the preliminary 
round, helping his team to a 37.38 mark that broke a 20-year-old American record for the fastest preliminary round.
“I just wanted to come out and have fun and 
enjoy the moment,” Demps said. “There was no pressure, I was just excited.”
Although he and Darvis Patton were re-
placed in the ﬁ  nal round by Tyson Gay and Ryan Bailey, Demps still received a silver medal for his efforts.
McQuay won the silver medal by running a 
season’s best 2:57.05 in the ﬁ  nals. Although Mc-Quay kept the team out in front, Angelo Taylor gave up the lead to Ramon Mille of the Bahamas, who ran a 44.10 on the ﬁ  nal leg of the race.
“I did my job for the day,” McQuay said. “I’m 
disappointed it wasn’t enough. The outcome is not what we wanted, our mission was gold. We got silver, but we have to be blessed with our opportunity today, because a lot of people don’t have this opportunity, and God selected us four people to come out here and run this relay.”
Novlene Williams-Mills won bronze in the 
women’s 4X400 relay, bringing the UF track and ﬁ  eld medal total to six.

Fourteen years ago, Abby Wambach 
and Heather Mitts celebrated Florida 
soccer’s first NCAA title.
In 2012, they celebrated a gold-medal 
victory for the United States at the Lon-don Olympics.
The 2012 gold medal was Wambach’s 
second and Mitts’ third. Wambach and Mitts both won gold in Athens in 2004. Mitts won in 2008, but Wambach was sidelined with a broken leg.
Wambach played a key role for the 
U.S. Women’s National Team on their road to the gold, scoring a goal in five of the six Olympic matches. She netted the game-winners against North Korea and New Zealand, and added a game-tying penalty kick in the semifinal match against Canada.
In her time at UF, Wambach won a national title and four Southeastern Con-ference championships. She was a four-time All-SEC team selection, a two-time SEC Player of the Year and a three-time All-American.
Wambach currently holds the Florida 
records for goals, assists, points, game-
winning goals and hat tricks.
Mitts only saw ac-
tion in one Olympic match, but was an ac-tive substitute for all of them.
Mitts spent four 
seasons playing for 
the Gators on the 
back line. She was a two-time All-Amer -
ican. She holds Florida records for ap-pearances, starts and minutes played.
Former Gator Lisa Raymond also 
succeeded in team activity with a bronze medal in mixed doubles, winning along-side Mike Bryan.42, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22, 2012

CLAIMED MEDALS FOR THE U.S. AT THE OLYMPICS.

Alligator Staff Writer
Former Gator Ryan Lochte 
cemented himself as one of the 
greatest Olympians of all time this summer, hauling in five med-als to bring his career total to 11, which ties him with Mark Spitz for second all-time among male swimmers. 
Lochte’s five medals in the 
London 2012 Olympics tied him with Dara Torres for the most medals won by a Gator in a single Games and headlined an 11-med-al haul for Florida swimmers. 
In all, 23 Gators swimmers 
participated, including five from the 2011-12 rosters, while UF head coach Gregg Troy took the same role with the U.S. men’s team. 
Lochte was one of only five 
athletes in any sport to claim at least five medals, bringing home two golds, two silvers and a bronze. 
Elizabeth Beisel claimed a 
silver and a bronze, while Dana Vollmer, who began her collegiate career at Florida, took home three golds, making her one of only six athletes to do so in 2012.
Conor Dwyer also won a gold, 
teaming up with Lochte, Michael Phelps and Ricky Berens to win the 4x200-meter freestyle relay. Lochte and Dwyer swam the first two legs, giving the United States team a lead that it never relin-quished. 
Lochte also won gold in the 
first event of the Olympiad, fin-ishing the 400 individual medley in 4:05.18  — the second fastest time ever. 
The early win set the tone for 
Lochte, who anchored the 4x100 
freestyle relay to a silver on day 2 and narrowly avoided the po-dium with a fourth-place finish in the 200 free on day 3. 
Lochte’s final day was his bus-
iest, as he claimed a bronze in the 200 backstroke and a silver in the 200 IM in races separated by just 31 minutes. 
Lochte barely missed adding 
another gold to his haul, finish-ing less than one second behind Phelps in the 200 IM.
Beisel, a rising junior at UF, 
took silver in the women’s 400 IM with a new personal record of 4:31.27. She also claimed bronze in the 200 back. 
Vollmer, who spent her fresh-
man year at Florida before trans-ferring to Cal in 2006, won gold in the 100 butterfly with a world record time of 55.98. She was also a part of two relay golds, anchor -
ing the 4x200 free and swimming the fly leg of a 4x100 medley that set a world record of 3:53.05. 
Overall, Gators swimmers 
won six gold medals, three sil-vers and two bronzes.

After three straight years of just 
missing out on an outdoor national 
title, the men’s track and field team finally had enough.
On the final day of the 2012 
NCAA Outdoor Championships, the men’s 4x400-meter broke a UF record with 3:00.02 to not only win the first 4x400 relay title in Florida history, but also the school’s first NCAA Outdoor Championship.
Sprinter Tony McQuay and 
jumper Omar Craddock repeated their NCAA Indoor Championship performances by winning indi-vidual titles in the 400 meters and triple jump, respectively.
Although UF won three individ-
ual titles at the meet, the outdoor national title did not come easy. 
Florida had to compete in Iowa 
without Jeff Demps (100 meters), Gray Horn (decathlon) and the men’s 4x100 relay team. 
Even though the Gators strug-
gled in the three events, Florida was still able to edge LSU by two points. 
UF’s win made it the first team 
to win both the indoor and outdoor title in the same year since Arkan-sas in 2005. 
The Razorbacks later vacated 
their outdoor title due to NCAA violations. 
The women’s team had a prom-
ising start to their postseason with a runner-up finish at the Southeast-ern Conference Outdoor Champi-onships.
 However, the Gators had a dis-
appointing conclusion to their 2012 season with a 12th-place showing at the NCAA Outdoor Champion-ships.
Winning a fourth consecutive 
indoor national title next season will be a tougher task for the men than it has been in the past due to the departure of four prominent athletes. 
Together, Demps, Horn, Mc-
Quay and Kemal Mesic have ac-counted for 149 of Florida’s 400 points during the last four years of NCAA Championship appear-ances.

The Gators appeared primed to make a run in the 
NCAA Tournament before being done in by a trio of costly 
suspensions.
Hours before the NCAA Regional opener, Florida an-
nounced it would be without Cheyenne Coyle and both the Fagan sisters, Sami and Kasey. With a depleted lineup, UF lost 2-1 to Florida Gulf Coast and subsequently entered the 
losers’ bracket. 
After the defeat, coach Tim Walton 
announced that the three girls were sus-
pended for the remainder of the season for an undisclosed reason. 
Although Florida stayed alive by de-
feating UCF and FGCU in a rematch, it ended its season with a 1-0 loss to USF in the regional championship. The Gators 
ended their streak of four consecutive appearances in the Women’s College World Series and failed to advance past the NCAA Regional round for the first time since 2006. 
Florida was predicted to win the Southeastern Confer-
ence title in the preseason coaches’ poll but fell to Alabama, the eventual national champions, in the semifinals. 
Walton and company still managed to receive a No. 5 
seed in the NCAA Tournament and an opportunity to host an NCAA Regional for the eighth consecutive season.

As the top-ranked team in the nation head-
ing into the College World Series, Florida 
looked primed to win its first-ever national championship in 2012 after coming just two wins short last season. Instead, the Gators made their earliest CWS exit in school history.
Florida dropped back-to-back contests to 
South Carolina and Kent State to become the second team eliminated in Omaha. 
UF’s starting pitchers struggled in the 
CWS. Lefty Brian Johnson surrendered five runs in four innings as the Gators dropped their opener 7-3 to the Gamecocks. Against the Golden Flashes, ace Hudson Randall lasted just one frame before exiting due to heat-relat-ed issues.
Despite failing to clinch both the South-
eastern Conference regular season and  tour -
nament titles, the Gators still earned the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament.
Florida dominated the NCAA Gainesville 
Regional with strong starting pitching and timely hitting. Sophomore right-hander Jona-thon Crawford, who coach Kevin O’Sullivan left off Florida’s College World Series roster in 2011, pitched a no-hitter in a 4-0 win against Bethune-Cookman on June 1.Crawford’s complete-game no-no was the 
first by a Gators hurler since John Burke ac-
complished the feat against Furman in the 1991 NCAA East Regional. 
Then, the UF offense 
exploded for 21 combined runs in consecutive wins against Georgia Tech to 
earn a spot in the NCAA Gainesville Super Regional against N.C. State.
The Gators’ two-game sweep against the 
Wolfpack was a testy, rain-soaked affair. The situation grew heated between both squads and the umpires in a series that featured more than five hours of rain delays.
After the two-hour, 23-minute weather de-
lay during Game 2, N.C. State manager Elliott Avent argued with umpires about the condi-tion of the field. Ultimately, he was overruled.
Perhaps the most demonstrative argument 
came on the final play of Game 2. After Wolf-pack shortstop Chris Diaz struck out looking in Florida’s 9-8 victory in extra innings, he slammed his batting helmet on the ground and chased after home-plate umpire Steve Corvi to argue the call.

The last two NCAA women’s 
tennis seasons have ended with 
Lauren Embree.
As a sophomore in 2011, she 
was down 4-0 in the decisive third set in the clinching match of the NCAA Championship before rallying back to win the title for the Gators. 
In 2012, Embree dominated 
UCLA’s McCall Jones, 6-4, 6-0, to give Florida a 4-0 victory and their second consecutive champi-onship.
“I’m glad this one wasn’t as 
dramatic,” Embree said.
The Gators began the 2012 
campaign ranked No. 1 in the ITA rankings and did not disap-point, finishing the season with a 27-1 record and sweeping the Southeastern Conference regular-season and tournament titles.
“We discovered this year that, 
without a doubt, it is much more difficult to repeat,” coach Roland Thornqvist said.
The Gators came into the final 
match as the No. 2 seed. Flori-da had only surrendered three points in the entire tournament, all coming against Duke in the NCAA semifinals.
Against UCLA, the Gators left 
no doubt, dominating the Bru-ins from the moment both teams stepped onto the courts.In doubles play, the top-
ranked team of Sofie Oyen and Allie Will won their match, 8-2.
Alexandra Cercone and Caro-
lina Hitimana followed Will and Oyen, winning their match 8-5 to give the Gators the doubles point.
Cercone was the first to fin-
ish in singles play, winning her match, 6-2, 6-0.She was later named to the 
NCAA All-Tournament team for the second consecutive year.
Oyen followed Cercone and 
also won in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2. 
Senior Joanna Mather had just 
started her third set when Em-bree clinched the title.
“It’s just incredible,” Mather 
said. “I just can’t believe it’s over and we did it again.”WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 47

SEVEN-POINT LEAD IN FINAL 12 MINUTES

Despite making history , the 
Gators season ended in disap-
pointment.
Florida completed the most 
successful campaign in the pro-gram’s short history , but the Gators still fell two steps short of their ultimate goal: a national championship.
In the Final Four against 
Syracuse, Florida held a 12-5 lead with less than 12 minutes to play , but lost in overtime. The Orange finished the game on a 9-1 run. 
The Gators thought they 
had won when junior forward Gabi Wiegand scored on a free-position shot with nine seconds left in the first overtime, but the goal was disallowed when the referee ruled the stick’s pocket was illegal.
 The Orange won with 2:02 
left in the second overtime on a goal from Sarah Holden. 
Syracuse would go on to lose in the championship to North-western, who Florida beat 14-7 in the American Lacrosse Con-ference Tournament champion-ship game on May 5. 
Florida defeated Albany 
in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament, 6-4, and followed that win with a 15-2 blowout against Penn State to advance to the NCAA semifi-nals in Stony Brook, N.Y . 
Even after the loss to Syra-
cuse, the team has reason for optimism looking ahead to the 2013 season.
The Gators  return a 
12-member senior class for 2013, in-cluding Kitty 
Cullen, the NCAA’s  second-lead-ing scorer in 2011, and 
Tewaaraton Award finalist Brit-tany Dashiell. 
Only graduated forward 
Caroline Cochran, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL, will not return to the team.
