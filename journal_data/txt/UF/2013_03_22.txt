Many people thought Kenny Boynton 
would leave Florida after his freshman sea-
son three years ago. 
When he first committed to Florida on 
Oct. 30, 2008, the phrase “one and done” was often thrown around to describe the McDonald’s All-American from Pompano Beach.
Boynton came to Gainesville as the No. 
12 recruit in his class — the highest-ranked player coach Billy Donovan had success-fully recruited and signed at the time since Rivals.com began ranking basketball pros-pects in 2003.
For a team coming off consecutive NIT 
appearances in 2007-2009, the 6-foot-2 Boynton was expected to be an immediate but temporary solution in the backcourt for the Gators, who had just lost starting point guard Nick Calathes to a professional team in Greece.  
As an undersized but electric guard, 
Boynton was a scoring machine in high school.
After splitting four years at Pompano 
Beach Blanche Ely High and American Her-itage High in Plantation, Boynton finished his high school career as the third-leading scorer in the history of Florida high school basketball and one of the best players from Broward County.  
On the surface, everything about Boyn-
ton shouted “NBA” and “one and done.”
“I know a lot of people expected it to go 
that way,” Boynton said. 
        
Although his NBA stock is no longer as 
high as it once was, Boynton has developed into one of the best players to don a Florida uniform.
Boynton has been a cog in UF’s start-
ing lineup at shooting guard the past four years, starting 138 games and logging 4,564 minutes – both school bests.
He has not missed a game in his colle-
giate career and has started in all but three contests.Despite a few shooting slumps along 
the way, Boynton has averaged 14.1 points per game on 39.9 percent shooting in 141 games.
During his time in Gainesville, Boynton 
has helped the Gators earn two Elite Eight appearances and a pair of SEC regular-sea-son titles.
He ranks second on UF’s all-time scoring 
list with 1,995 points and owns the school record for three-point shots made.  
“I didn’t think about breaking records 
or anything like that when I first got here,” Boynton said.
Heading into No. 3 seed Florida’s second-
round NCAA Tournament matchup against 14th-seeded Northwestern State tonight at 7:27 p.m., Boynton is 95 points shy of Ron-nie Williams’ scoring record.
If Florida were to advance to the national 
title game, Boynton would need to average 19 points per game to tie Williams. 
While the all-time scoring feat seems out 
of reach for Boynton, he has never been en-thralled with records or statistics.
“Kenny’s about the team stats and get-
ting victories for his team,” said Danny Herz, Boynton’s high school coach at Amer-ican Heritage. “He’s been around individ-ual stats all his life because of his scoring prowess.”
This season, Boynton has seen a drop-
off as a scorer, averaging a career-worst 12.3 points per game on a career-low 10.3 attempts per game. He has dealt with two five-game shooting slumps this year – a pair of droughts where he shot 13 of 51 and 17 of 53. 
“When he struggles, he always comes 
out with a little bang,” senior forward Erik Murphy said.
“We always have confidence in him re-
gardless. I always think he’s going to score or make shots.”
Boynton has also struggled late in games 
this season, shooting 0 of 2 from the field in the final 30 seconds when Florida trails a team by one or two points. 
“When people watch him and the ball 
doesn’t go in the basket, it’s very, very easy to point fingers,” Donovan said.
“Maybe of anybody on our team, Kenny Boynton is truly loved inside of our team because he’s a great teammate. When he’s making some shots, it livens up our team, because our team looks to him in a lot of ways.”
During his career, Boynton has devel-
oped multiple facets of his game outside of scoring. 
Boynton has improved his rebounding 
(3.1 boards per game) this season. In his four years at UF, he has become one of Florida’s top on-ball defenders. 
As Florida’s backup point guard this 
season, Boynton has improved his ability to distribute the ball, averaging a career-best three assists per game. 
Donovan admires Boynton’s emotional 
consistency as much as the senior’s steady play on the floor.
“When you’re dealing with young peo-
ple, there’s usually a wide range of emo-tions sometimes you have to deal with,” Donovan said.
“Somebody’s box that they play in is 
pretty wide. He’s about as consistent of a guy as I’ve coached since his freshman year. His mood never changes. He’s reliable. You know what you’re getting.”
In his four seasons as a Gator, Boynton 
has also blossomed off the court. Coming to Florida as a reserved, soft-spoken kid, Boynton only would let loose around his family and those in his close circle. 
Through the years, he has gradually bro-
ken out of his shell. 
Boynton can often be seen bantering with 
his teammates during warm-ups and after games. His favorite things to joke about are rap lyrics and the rivalry between Kobe Bry-ant and LeBron James. 
“My freshman and sophomore year, he 
didn’t really talk too much to everyone else,” junior center Patric Young said.
“But this year I really got a chance to see 
who he is as a person. He’s a really great guy, really funny, a really good guy to be around.”
Added Boynton’s roommate and senior 
forward Erik Murphy: “That’s just come with age for him. He’s grown up, getting older and getting more connected.”        
Boynton never imagined he would re-
main at Florida for four years, but his par-ents did. 
His family never wanted him to be a one-
and-done player. 
“I don’t believe in that, unless if you’re 
LeBron James or what have you,” said Dana Boynton, Kenny’s mother.
“I wanted him to experience the college 
life.”
Kenny comes from a tight-knit family 
that always emphasized the importance of academics and following a blueprint out-side the world of basketball. 
Dana, 46, has been a teacher for more 
than 25 years. She currently teaches English at Pompano Beach Middle School. 
Kenny’s father, Kenny Boynton Sr., 48, 
was a standout at Bethune-Cookman for four seasons.
He is now a deputy with the Broward 
County Sheriff’s department. 
Kenny’s older brother, Deandre Boyn-
ton, 26, was a point guard at Division II West Florida from 2005-2009 and still owns school records in steals and assists.
Deandre currently lives in Houston 
and has worked as a sports agent at Im-pact Sports Management for the past three years.
Kendia, 27, Kenny’s older sister, gradu-
ated from Florida A&M in 2009 and is em-ployed at a property insurance firm in Fort Lauderdale. 
Kenny’s parents know plenty about plan-
ning ahead.
“We’ve tried our best to keep him 
grounded and keep [Kenny] humble,” Dana said. “We’ve just kept it real with him.”
Said Herz: “His parents get it, in terms of 
what’s right from wrong.”
Dana and Kenny Sr. have monitored 
Boynton’s academic progress all his life. 
From elementary to high school, Dana 
would make sure Kenny completed his schoolwork before going outside to shoot hoops.
Every day, Kenny would spend an hour 
and a half at the dining table finishing as-signments.  
“She’s always on top of us about our 
work,” Deandre said.
“That’s something I’ve always known 
growing up. If you don’t do your work, I had to deal with my mom. That was some-thing I was always afraid of.
“School is very important, and if he 
didn’t take that seriously, there’s no reward after school.”
Kenny’s parents consult with Tom Wil-
liams, assistant athletics director for the UAA, every two weeks to make sure Boyn-ton has met academic expectations in col-lege. 
Williams said Kenny has done well aca-
demically this year.
“Each year it’s, ‘What’s next in line? 
What do I need to do? What do I need to accomplish?’” Williams said. “His parents have instilled that in him.”
Kenny also found a mentor figure in 
Melvin Randall, his high school basketball coach and math teacher at Ely.
Randall, who had known the Boynton 
family since Kenny was born, became his godfather when Kenny was in the ninth grade. 
Randall was also successful mentoring Kenny on the hardwood. Together, they helped Ely win the FHSAA Class 6A state championship in 2006. 
But after his sophomore season, Kenny 
made a surprising decision, transferring from Ely to American Heritage. 
Academics were as one of the main rea-
sons Kenny transferred. 
“I felt like Ely wasn’t a challenge for 
him,” Dana said.
“I wanted him to be challenged and col-
lege-ready. It was a very hard process, very hard. … Deep down inside, I’m sure he un-derstood.”
Kenny was not struggling academical-
ly at Ely. He posted a 3.5 GPA during his sophomore year, according to Randall. 
“[Kenny is] the type where he wanted 
to be pushed even more,” Randall said. “I thought that was pretty cool. A lot of kids these days want to transfer for — I shouldn’t say for the wrong reasons — but for the ath-letic reasons instead of the academic rea-sons.”
Kenny, 21, is set to graduate from UF in 
May with a degree in sociology.
Once Kenny’s playing career is done 
—whether it’s at the NBA or overseas — his family members see him pursuing a profes-sion involving sports.
Deandre thinks Kenny would eventually 
want to coach down the line. 
“At the end of the day with today’s gen-
eration, you don’t see it a lot,” Deandre said. “You can look at people like LeBron and look at other guys, but Kenny will have something those guys don’t have — a de-gree.”
Added Dana: “What I wanted to see is 
being done.”
        
Boynton has achieved many things in his 
four-year career at Florida, but still missing is a key accomplishment: a Final Four ap-pearance. 
After two straight heartbreaking losses 
in the Elite Eight to Butler in 2011 and Lou-isville in 2012, Boynton is hungry to take the next step. 
Over the phone Tuesday night, Randall 
spoke to Boynton, who sought advice be-fore the No. 3 seed Gators face the No. 14 seed Demons tonight. 
Randall’s message to Boynton was di-
rect. 
“‘This is your last March Madness. This 
is it,’” Randall told Boynton.
“He’s going into this March Madness 
with a little fire in his eyes.”
Boynton told ESPN’s Andy Katz on Jan. 
8 that anything less than the Final Four this season would be a failure. 
“I want them to say that I went out as 
a winner,” Boynton said. “In my four years here, I’ve tried my best to win as much as I could. Definitely, I want to go out this year as a winner, winning the national champi-onship.”

Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe was ar-
rested on DUI charges about 12 miles out-
side the city early Thursday.
The Florida Highway Patrol arrested 
Lowe, 55, near Northeast 21st Street and Northeast 156th Avenue at 5:26 a.m., ac-cording to a FHP arrest report.
At about 2:20 a.m., Lowe lost control of 
his 2005 Honda Civic while driving south on Northeast 21st Street, according to an FHP news release. He hit a Florida Depart-ment of Transportation 
sign as well as a ditch and came to a stop on the side of the road.
Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office depu-ties responded first to the crash. When FHP trooper Javon Murphy arrived, he reported 
Lowe’s breath smelled like alcohol, his eyes were bloodshot and he had trouble keeping his balance. 
Murphy also reported Lowe’s car was damaged in the front and had four flat tires.
Lowe told Murphy he crashed because 
he fell asleep while driving. Lowe also admitted to drinking three beers earlier in the night, according to the report. He added  his last drink was at about 10 p.m. Wednesday.
Lowe “performed poorly” during a 
field sobriety test, according to the report, and he was arrested for DUI just before 5 a.m. Troopers later booked him into the

Gainesville and Sydney, Australia residents 
are separated by continents and oceans, but this 
weekend they’ll be connected by a common universal goal.
On Saturday from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., 
millions of people from across the world will switch off lights for one hour to show concern for the environment.
Alachua County, the city of Gainesville and 
UF will commemorate Earth Hour for the fifth year in a row. The lights at Century Tower, the Albert and Alberta statues and Flavet Field ten-nis courts are some participating icons.
It’s the first time the Reitz Union and the 
Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art will be partici-pating, said UF Office of Sustainability program assistant Michael Amish.  
“[By participating in the event], you’d be 
supporting the Gator Nation in its pursuit in being the leading campus in the country for sustainability,” Amish said.
Some buildings around campus will go dark 
for that one hour, while others will stay unlit the entire weekend, Amish said. 
Chris Whitehurst, UF Physical Plant Divi-
sion’s business manager, said UF’ll save about $500 worth of electricity for the whole weekend. The physical plant plays an instrumental role in the actual process of shutting off lights.
Jeff Chorlog, the assistant vice president for 
the physical plant, said it takes two men and about eight hours to change the lights’ timers for the weekend.UF will

Drew Smith didn’t expect to become a fra-
ternity brother in the hospital.
Members of UF’s chapter of Theta Chi sur-
prised the 20-year-old history sophomore at 
Shands at UF Wednesday night with a per-sonal initiation ceremony.Smith was diagnosed with acute myeloid 
leukemia during his senior year of high school. But even after beating cancer in July 2011, his immune system is still weak. He checked into the hospital Tuesday night for stomach pain.
Smith transferred to UF in January and got 
a bid from Theta Chi. He worked his way up to the title of pledge class president.
“They have good things coming in the next couple of years, and I want to be a part of that,” Smith said.
Finance senior Travis Johnson, 21, said he 
chose Smith to be his little brother because he saw Smith’s potential and strength. When he learned Smith might not be released in time for the initiation ceremony, Johnson coordi-nated the surprise with Smith’s mother.
Nine brothers dressed in black blazers and red ties to initiate Smith as the first brother of his pledge class — from his hospital bed.
“Everyone in the brotherhood felt he de-
served it,” Johnson said.
Smith plans to leave the hospital today. 
He’s looking forward to attending the frater-nity’s formal this weekend.

not go,” he said.Theta Chi brothers initiate member — from his hospital bedgreek LifeNews Today

Speeding Iowa dad ignores

IOWA CITY, Iowa — An Iowa 
man who was pulled over for speeding as he rushed his preg-nant wife to the hospital said he was determined to keep going despite the police lights flashing behind him.
Tyler Rathjen planned to keep 
going as his wife, Ashley, began giving birth to their son in the passenger seat. But a red light with heavy traffic finally forced him to stop.
“I should not stop, I’m not go-
ing to, I’m going to get to the hos-pital,” Tyler Rathjen said. 
The baby’s head and arms 
were already out by the time Iowa City Officer Kevin Wolfe reached the passenger door.
“We were all having a differ-

A sign is knocked over near Northeast 21st Street and Northeast 156th Avenue after 
Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe crashed his car into it early Thursday morning. 
Lowe’s runoff opponent, Braddy, was arrested for DUI in 2006
Alachua County Jail.
At the jail, Lowe took a breath test. 
His blood alcohol content levels were 
.061 and .069. Murphy concluded Lowe’s BAC was above .08 at the time of the crash, according to the report.
Lowe was released from jail at about 
4:15 p.m. Thursday on his own recogni-zance.
Later that evening, Lowe issued a 
statement: “I apologize for the harm that this situation has caused to my friends, supporters, and the citizens of Gainesville,” he said. “I feel that it’s important to set the record straight. In the coming days, additional facts will come to light and I believe that I will [be] found not guilty in this case.”
Lowe also will work toward strength-
ening the community’s trust in him, say-ing, “I look forward to getting back to work for the people of Gainesville.”
Lowe served as a city commissioner 
from 2003 to 2010.  In 2010, he won by a 42-vote margin in a runoff.
Lowe is running for re-election 
against Ed Braddy in the April 16 runoff election.In response to the arrest, Braddy, 41, 
said Thursday afternoon that he encour-ages “people to give Mayor Lowe his space so that he can deal with this matter as he sees fit.”
“We should be grateful that no one 
was injured,” he said.
During his term as a city commis-
sioner from 2002 to 2008, Braddy was arrested on a DUI-damage to person/property in January 2006. His BAC lev-els were reported to be .181 and .184, ac-cording to the arrest report.
At Thursday’s City Commission 
meeting, commissioner Susan Bottcher expressed sensitivity toward the situa-tion.
“Until we get a little more informa-
tion, my thoughts and prayers are with the mayor,” she said.
In the days leading up to April 16, 
Braddy said voters will make up their own minds about the incident.
“The test of leadership is how you re-

Exchange that coffee cup for a 
beaker, because there’s some science 
brewing northeast of campus.
The Brew Spot Café, located at 
1000 NE 16th Ave., is a trendy bistro that serves up chemistry study ses-sions along with baked breads, pas-tries and coffees.
Jeff Keaffaber, co-owner of the 
cafe, currently offers free help for general and organic chemistry stu-dents several times at the bistro. However, Keaffaber, who is also a professor in UF’s Department of Chemistry, is retiring at the end of this semester and will continue teaching as well as operating the cafe full time.
“I’ve always wanted to celebrate 
the culinary arts,” he said. “This is a transition to the next project in my life.”
Keaffaber will begin charging for 
sessions this summer. Each session will cost about $15, and students will receive a $5 food coupon with every session. He said the sessions are also open to Santa Fe College and local high school students.“It doesn’t really matter what 
level you’re at in those courses,” he said. “There’s going to be something for everyone.”
Keaffaber has a background in 
entertainment and engineering. He worked with Walt Disney Imagi-neering for six years. He said he used his experience with Disney to design his cafe, which includes an open-air kitchen, a 250-gallon fish tank and a 1,200-square-foot classroom with chalkboard-painted walls.
Keaffaber said an average session 
will consist of five to 15 students.
“The idea is to create a commu-
nity of learners in a small setting,” he said.
Keaffaber said the sessions are 
not instructor specific but rather a general lesson on chemistry.
“It’s all about the students,” he 
said. “I’d like to use what I’ve used over the years in teaching to give students a different insight into the science.”
Ryan Wood, a 26-year-old UF chemistry graduate student, said he has gotten to know Keaffaber after working as his teaching assistant last year. Wood said he studies at the cafe twice week.
“I’m usually coming for the 
food,” he said.
He likes the food so much that 
one of the cooks made him his own special, The Wood Dog: a hotdog topped with onions, peppers and cheese and a side of potatoes.
Keaffaber sees results in the stu-
dents that receive his help.
“I benefit from seeing them be 
successful,” he said.

For Kristina von Castel-Roberts and 
her 45,000 students, there’s no seat ca-
pacity in her classroom.
The nutrition professor is the first in 
the university to teach a massive open online course through Coursera.
Coursera partners with 62 top-tier 
universities worldwide to offer free non-credit courses that anyone can take. UF is the first Florida university to participate.
More than 45,000 students in six con-
tinents have been enrolled in von Castel-Roberts’ Fundamentals of Human Nu-trition class, which began in January.
She began her online class in 2006. To 
make it relevant to her diverse students, von Castel-Roberts said she expanded her course material to include nutritional recommendations from other countries.
She said the class with Coursera gave 
her a better glimpse of global nutrition.
“It’s been an educational experience,” 
she said.
Associate provost for teaching and 
technology Andy McCollough praised UF’s partnership with Coursera. He said the university wanted to share its courses with the rest of the world, and professors would have the opportunity to work with online experts.
“The benefits will be enjoyed by fac-
ulty and students,” McCollough said.
Even though the 
university doesn’t make any money, he said, massive open online courses are a worthy investment.
Agricultural and 
biological engineer-
ing professor Wendell Porter’s class starts 
Monday. He said his enrollment has topped 18,500 students.
“I’m teaching two-cities worth of 
people,” Porter said.
Porter, who started his online class in 
2008, began recording new videos and making all minor changes in October.
“They don’t use the word massive for 
nothing,” he said.

� COACH BECKY BURLEIGH SAYS 
HEADING IS PART OF THE GAME.
BRITTNY PEREZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Researchers recently found through an iPad 
app-based experiment that repeated hits to the 
head, such as heading a soccer ball, could affect an athlete’s performance on cognitive tasks.
Emily Flood, certified athletic trainer for 
UF’s women’s soccer, said this study provides a good basis for the concussion discussion.
“There are so many different ways you can 
head a ball,” she said. “Some girls control it like a pass because it’s a soft-header, or it’s a hard-header that they’re trying to compete with-someone to win in the middle of the field.”
The study included 24 teenage female par-
ticipants, 12 soccer players and 12 non-soccer players. Researchers found the soccer players were much slower than non-soccer players on a task that tested their reaction speed.
Becky Burleigh, head coach of UF’s wom-
en’s soccer team, said the concern of heading and concussions is an evolving issue.
“Until we have conclusive evidence that 
heading is an issue, that’s just a part of our game,” Burleigh said. “We wouldn’t want to be at a competitive disadvantage for not heading when other teams are.”
Injuries can occur when people hit each oth-
er as opposed to the ball, or if a player doesn’t have his or her arms up for protection of the space around them, Burleigh said.
Both Flood and Burleigh said teaching 
proper technique is a precautionary measure that can prevent players from getting concus-sions after heading a soccer ball.
Austin Zide, a goalie for a UF men’s club 
soccer team, has only had one concussion since starting competitive soccer at age 7.
However, the 18-year-old finance freshman 
won’t allow a study based on concussions and heading in soccer to affect the way he plays the game.
“I love the game,” he said. “I wouldn’t let 
something like that worry me or change some-thing that I like to do.”Heading in soccer poses a 
blow to players, study says

Natasha Parekh took a deep breath and 
swan dived forward until her spine ran 
parallel to her legs. 
The 25-year-old school psychology grad-
uate student was one of seven students en-rolled in the Art of Living Youth Empow-erment and Skills Workshop that began Thursday evening. 
The Art of Living is a national self-de-
velopment program. 
The class is sponsored by YES+ Gators, a 
UF organization that centers around stress management techniques for young adults.
“I see it as an overall wellness camp,” 
Parekh said.
The workshop is from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
Friday and from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m on Saturday and Sunday in the Reitz Union. For $250, students can put stress aside for 
the weekend in a room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the amphitheater.
Nitin Garg, a volunteer weekly instruc-
tor, brought in two teachers from Miami for the session.
He said students will learn breathing 
techniques, yoga poses, games and medita-tion.
“It’s a very beautiful combination,” Garg 
said. “It makes students look inside them-selves and gives them peace and medita-tion.”
For Parekh, yoga runs in the family. She said her dad, sister and younger 
brother all completed the Art of Living workshop.
She said her father is a licensed yoga in-
structor.
“With all the violence going on,” she 
said. “People our age need to start taking better care of their wellb-eing and mental health.”

The Aspen Institute has ranked 
Santa Fe College as one of the top 10 
community colleges in the country.
SFC is one of only two institu-
tions in the state to receive Aspen’s top 10 acknowledgement. The insti-tute looked at about 1,200 other col-leges nationwide.This is the institute’s second year 
awarding the College Excellence Program Prize, said David Houder, director of communications at SFC.
Santa Fe did not make the top 10 
last year, Houder said, but it is over-joyed to have gotten the recognition a second time around.
“Everyone is thrilled,” he said. 
“As a community college, you fly under the radar, and the good stuff sometimes doesn’t get noticed.”
Houder said the colleges are 
evaluated on things like gradua-tion percentages and job placement rates.
Katie Walker, a 19-year-old SFC 
exercise science sophomore, said she wasn’t surprised by the rank-ing.
“I like the small classes, and I 
love everything about Santa Fe,” she said.
Walker said she thinks it’s the 
amount of available one-on-one time with professors that makes SFC a top 10 college.
Tim Warren, 18, will start his 
freshman year at SFC in the Fall. Having received his acceptance let-ter, the deciding factor for choosing SFC depended on its ranking, War-ren said.
“This is one thing that’s encour-
aging me to go there,” he said.

Local gardeners and green 
thumbs can ﬁ  nd a place for their 
passions to bloom at the Kanapaha Botanical Gardens this weekend.
Plant fans are gathering to cele-
brate the 23rd annual Spring Garden Festival on Saturday and Sunday at the gardens, located at 4700 SW 58th Drive.
“The event is really the celebra-
tion of the start of spring,” said Alexis Caffrey, director of Kanapaha Gardens. “It’s one of the major hor-ticultural events here in Alachua County.”
The two-day event will feature 
about 200 booths selling plants, gar-den-related materials and food, Caf-frey said.  
For entertainment, the park will 
include a live auction, a butterﬂ  y conservatory and local music.This year’s theme is “Passalong 
Plants,” which are plants that friends and family may grow and share with each other, Caffrey said.
“We thought it was a very ﬁ  tting 
theme, considering the fact that most of the plants when we ﬁ  rst started here at the gardens were passed along,” she said. “Things that peo-ple either outgrew ... or just plants that people had extra of.”
Caffrey said about 7,000 people 
attended last year’s event and ex-pects that same number this week-end.
Admission into the event will be 
$8 for adults and $5 for children. Members of the gardens will receive a $2 discount.
Alicia Bernard, a 20-year-old UF 
family, youth and community ser-vices sophomore, said she doesn’t plan on going to the festival, but she believes children will get a lot from the event.
“They like to learn and are open 
to new experiences,” she said. “I think that they would enjoy it.”Plant lovers to celebrate beginning of spring at annual festivalReader response

Hi, sorry, we seem to have misplaced the brakes on Spring

Seven years ago, we were all just a bunch of young guns, 
unaware of how the world was changing around us. Then 
Twitter was invented. This week, Twitter turned 7 years old, and we basically couldn’t imagine life without it. Remember when people thought it was just a cheap, worse version of Fa-cebook? Realized by now it’s mostly a place where you and all of your friends practice being funny and complain about your other friends? There are also subtweets, where you talk about someone behind their back, and “intimifavs” of sub-tweets, where you favorite a subtweet you know is about you. What a great thing that was invented! Cattiness aside, Twitter has done some amazing things and actually helps people track important political and social movements around the world. We give a it’s-still-a-time-waster-of-a-website-but-dang-social-Web-sure-is-the-future LAUREL to Twitter. (And happy birth-
day to Taco Bell this week as well.) 
Journalism doesn’t stop to rest, uh, ever. It’s a crazy ma-
chine of breaking news and poop ships, and all of it has to get checked by editors and copy editors. Imagine our surprise when we heard a freshman reporter for The Crimson White, the University of Alabama’s student newspaper, made up about 30 people since January as sources for her stories. “I was overwhelmed and succumbed to a lot of pressure I’d been under,” the reporter said in an email this week, according to an article on the newspaper’s website. “I did it because The Crimson White had become so important to me that I didn’t want to lose it.” Her giant ruse came to light when one of her latest stories was being edited on March 13. “The paper’s copy editors, while fact-checking the correct spelling of one of the fabricated students’ names,” the article continued, “discovered that no such student existed.” Listen. It is so much more work to make stuff up than it is to do the actual research. We give a sorry-Alabama-hope-you-guys-all-chill-out-so-your-report-ers-don’t-ﬂ  ip-out-again DART to The Crimson White.
Do you need something to spike your blood pressure? Good! 
Rush Limbaugh criticized Beyoncé’s new song, “Bow Down/I Been On,” this week. “She’s got a new song, ‘Bow down, bitch-es,’ a total 180,” Limbaugh said on his radio show, according to a Billboard article. “Beyoncé’s now saying, ‘go ahead and put up with it.’ And you know why? I’ll tell you why. She married the rich guy. She’s even calling herself Mrs. Carter on the tour. She has shelved Beyoncé.” We guess he missed lyrics from the song like: “I took some time to live my life, but don’t think I’m just his little wife” because they directly disagree with the ex-tremism Limbaugh likes to spout. We give a please-retire-so-we-don’t-have-a-collective-American-heart-attack-about-you DART to Limbaugh, but, also, a LAUREL to Beyoncé for be-

Spring semester 2013 will be a gay ol’ time
This year, spring will be gayer than winter.
UF’s Pride Student Union held the opening ceremo-
ny for its Pride Awareness Month on Monday. PAM is 
one of the largest student-run celebrations of queer culture and identity in the country.
PAM is always an entertaining and enlightening show-
case, but there is another arena in which queer matters will be emphasized this season. Speciﬁ  cally, the issue of gay mar-riage will soon be taking the spotlight in the United States Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court will hear the controversial case re-
garding California’s Proposition 8 on Tuesday. Then, the Court is set to hear the case regarding the Defense of Mar-riage Act on Wednesday.
Proposition 8 was the bill passed in California in 2008, 
which overturned the rights same-sex couples previously had to be married. The Defense of Marriage Act is a law which restricts the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages.
It is unclear when a decision for either of these cases will 
be reached, but some expect it will be by the end of June.
No matter what the decisions for those cases end up be-
ing, I think the time is soon approaching when same-sex couples will ﬁ  nally be treated equally under the law and be allowed to take part in the civil institution of marriage.
I can recall the day when Proposition 8 was passed. It was 
disappointing to hear about the decision that many Califor-nians made, just as it was disappointing to hear about the heavy involvement of the Mormon Church in supporting the passage of Proposition 8.
Today, the Church stands in support of Proposition 8 as 
strongly as ever. In January, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — the Mormon Church — ﬁ  led two briefs with the Supreme Court, one for each of the gay marriage cases.
The briefs were written on behalf of several Christian 
groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention.
“Our theological perspectives, though often differing, 
converge to support the proposition that the traditional, opposite-sex deﬁ  nition of marriage in the civil law is not only constitutional but essential to the welfare of families, children, and society,” reads the brief for the Defense of Mar-riage Act case.
Being raised Mormon, I can vouch for the integrity of that statement: Such a perspective is theologically supported and can be supported only on those grounds.
I haven’t heard a single ar-
gument against gay marriage — and only against gay mar-riage — that didn’t depend on a religious claim of some kind.
A lot has changed in the ﬁ  ve 
years since the passage of Prop-
osition 8. I think many people who have historically been opposed to gay marriage are coming to the conclusion that they are standing on the wrong side of history when they oppose it.
I have often found myself imagining a future in which 
our posterity will gawk at how slow we have been as a soci-ety to allow equality.
Earlier this month, a heartwarming appeal to Chief Justice 
Roberts was uploaded to YouTube. Twelve-year-old Daniel Martinez-Leffew, who was adopted along with his sister at the age of 5 by two gay men, got the idea to address Roberts when he heard the chief justice had two adopted children of his own. In the video, Daniel talks to Justice Roberts about the rights of “people like us.” If you have time to watch the clip, please do.
It’s easy to ignore how much courage that really takes. 
Imagine what it must feel like to have the people you love regularly labeled as ﬁ  lthy or wicked.
I am inspired by the courage of that 12-year-old. I am in-
spired by all who show courage in the face of a world that might not understand them.
To all those who are different, who have been called 
wicked or ugly or somehow wrong without due cause, your courage inspires me.
To them, I offer my most loving thanks. And thanks to all 
who would stand for morality and goodness.
If you ﬁ  nd that you have any free nights in the coming 
month, check out the Pride Awareness Month calendar. The events are sure to be edifying.
Happy spring, everyone.

As a loyal reader of the Alligator, I applaud their ef-
forts to feature a columnist with a different viewpoint. 
However, was Erik Skipper the best they could ﬁ  nd?
He could not be more out of touch with today’s soci-
ety. How do I know that he’s out of touch? Because in all of his other columns he quotes Fox News as the source for his arguments.
I don’t know Skipper personally, but I’m assuming he 
still thinks Earth is 8,000 years old.
Skipper cries about “under God” in the Pledge of Al-
legiance becoming under assault. He is probably unaware that the term wasn’t put in the pledge until 1954, just as “in God we trust” wasn’t put on dollar bills until 1957.
How the country went on for more than 175 years be-
fore that is a mystery.
Perhaps it was the slaves that helped build this coun-
try, not God. Just as praying was a part of history, so was slavery. While I’m all in favor of forcing Patric Young to stay here another year, I think it’s a good thing we no longer have slavery, and he’s allowed to enter the NBA draft if he so chooses. Skipper and the rest of the Tea Party needs to wake up and realize that times are changing for the better.  
I hate the argument that God leads to more morality.Just because a person doesn’t believe in God or doesn’t 
pray in public doesn’t mean they don’t believe in doing the right thing. And if someone wants to worship envi-ronmentalism, then let him or her. At least they can say without a doubt that the Earth actually exists.
Skipper says there should be God in schools, but he 
would probably feel differently if someone did a prayer in Hebrew or Arabic. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him standing alongside the people in my hometown of Tampa who protested when the Council on American-Islamic Relations wanted to speak at a local school. As for class-rooms, they won’t discuss scripture because they’re too busy discussing something that matters: science.
Little Erik has the right to believe the second human on 
planet Earth was created from the ﬁ  rst’s rib bone, but in a secular environment where real learning and reasoning  is encouraged, we teach something that has substance: evolution.
No one is stopping anyone from worshipping God, 
just like no one is going to stop Skipper from becoming a crazy Turlington preacher in 20 years.
The great thing about this country is you’re allowed to 
believe in what you want. People don’t think those people with signs by Turlington are crazy for what they believe in (well, maybe a little bit), but mainly because of the way they try to force it down other people’s throats.

Given the vast amount of damning information that 
has recently come out about the Cole Bros. Circus, it’s puzzling your piece mentioned not a word about it.
Recently, the circus agreed to pay a penalty of $15,000 
to settle charges with federal authorities for more than 10 violations including failing to provide adequate veteri-nary care to elephants traveling with the circus and fail-ure to hire personnel capable of caring for them.
The circus’ elephant handler is none other than Tim 
Frisco, who was caught on tape viciously attacking ter-riﬁ  ed elephants with sharp metal bullhooks and electric prods. The footage shows Frisco instructing other train-ers to hurt the elephants until they scream and to sink a bullhook into their ﬂ  esh and twist it. Frisco also cautioned that the beatings must be concealed from the public.
In 2011, the owner of the circus, John Pugh, pleaded 
guilty to violating the Endangered Species Act, the circus was ﬁ  ned $150,000, and Pugh was placed on four years probation for illegally selling two endangered Asian el-ephants. The court ordered Pugh individually to serve three years probation, hundred of hours of community service, an additional $4,000 ﬁ  ne and a mandatory $1,200 payment to an organization working toward conserva-tion and rehabilitation of Asian elephants.
Students have the right to know all sides of an issue so 
they can decide if they want to support an outﬁ  t with this sordid history.

There is a picture of rainbow house ﬂ  oating around 
the Internet right now that puts all other rainbow pictures to shame. 
Granted, the picture itself is not the whole story.For that, a simple Google search will ﬁ  ll in the rest. The rainbow house is across the street from Westboro 
Baptist Church, which is the group that claims American military deaths are punishment for accepting homosexuals. 
Not only does it feature a spiffy new paint job, but it 
will have a 30-foot ﬂ  agpole with a pride ﬂ  ag adorning it.
To top it all off, the man who started this project, 
Aaron Jackson, is planning to make the house a gay-rights center.
Personally, I ﬁ  nd this to be a brilliant way of ﬁ  ghting 
WBC. 
Although the intent is confrontational, the painting 
and re-purposing of the house itself is not.
There might be some zoning laws or aesthetic 
requirements that are not met.
But those are the only things I can think of that would 
unhinge this plan. 
The good the center can do will slightly offset the 
harm WBC inﬂ  icts upon everyone who must endure its hate instead of merely adding his voice to the cacophony of this debate — which we’re late to the party to, anyway. 
Most “civilized” countries have already settled this 
issue — Jackson was proactive and emphasized his words through action.
Although there is some truth to ﬁ  ghting ﬁ  re — or in 
this case, hate — with ﬁ  re, the fairy-tale virtue of love conquering all proves itself true in circumstances like these.
I went to a counterprotest of WBC when it appeared 
in Gainesville a few years ago.
Although never seeing any members of WBC or 
even seeing a controversy, the counterprotest became a celebration. 
Anyone on the fence about the debate would have 
been inspired.
They would have seen how ineffective WBC’s way of 
spreading its message truly is.
Raising up everyone is much more productive than 
tearing down those who already deal with enough negativity.
What astounds me, though, 
is some of the comments this story is getting.
One user complained the 
seller of the house did not get his asking price for the house.
 He then proceeded to insult 
Jackson for using the reduced price he eventually paid as self-
gloriﬁ  cation.
If this was Jackson’s ﬁ  rst altruistic project, it might 
have some truth. 
 It doesn’t, though. Jackson has a litany of other works that show this is 
not a single event.
Other comments claim this only helps WBC by giving 
it publicity, which is true on a small, mostly irrelevant level. 
Even so, I see that argument and raise that it works 
in reverse just as easily. 
Now when news stations get a shot of WBC’s 
headquarters, they can occasionally get the center in the frame as well. 
Normally, Internet comments lack merit and should 
be disregarded.
But not the comments on our opinion columns. I enjoy reading those because they are usually thought 
out and present interesting and unique viewpoints that augment the article.
But there was something that struck me when it came 
to this.
Here we have someone, the commenter, going out of 
his or her way to combat hate without adding more hate to the discussion.
 Yet, there are still those who try to ﬁ  nd something 
wrong with it.
I know Darts & Laurels is for the editorial, but I’d 
deﬁ  nitely like to add a LAUREL of my own to Jackson and what he does —  be it promoting gay rights or any of his other projects.
We need more doing instead of just talking.

Chemotherapy has left Anora virtually 
unaffected, but it isn’t a surprise.
Jan and Andy Hamilton’s greyhound 
Anora was diagnosed with lymphoma, a 
blood cancer, on Dec. 29. She started che-motherapy shortly thereafter.
Anora is one of many mammals that 
are treated in the CHOP program at UF’s Small Animal Hospital. CHOP is an acro-nym for the drugs prescribed in this regi-men. The dogs receive the same drugs as humans but don’t suffer the often intense side effects that people do.
“Most dogs with lymphoma, you can’t 
tell the difference with a dog who has no cancer,” said 38-year-old Dr. Kelvin Kow, a UF assistant professor of oncology and associate service chief of the UF Small An-imal Hospital. “Dogs don’t lose their hair generally. They don’t have the degree of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that peo-ple get with chemotherapy.”
Eighty percent of dogs that go through 
chemotherapy have few to no side effects at all, whereas 80 to 90 percent of people get sick, Kow said. About 3,000 animals a year are treated in the CHOP program.
Andy Hamilton, 68, said Anora has had 
minimal side effects from chemotherapy. 
The difference in treatment is in the 
dosage of the chemotherapy drugs. Dogs receive about half of the dosage that hu-mans would, Kow said.
“If a patient has no quality of life, why do it?” Kow said. “Our mantra — one, two and three — is quality of life, quality of life, quality of life.”
The CHOP program includes 16 che-
motherapy drug treatments over the span of 25 weeks, he said. Each treatment cost averages out to be about $300, which to-tals to about $4,500. 
Anora’s life doesn’t have a price to 
them, Andy Hamilton said.
“She would have been dead by now

The CHOP program extends a dog’s 
life between a year and a year and a half. The dogs’ response rate, when the cancer goes into remission, is about 85 to 90 per-cent, Kow said. This is about the same re-sponse rate for humans.
Anora is currently in complete remis-
sion after having gone through half of her

A 12-ounce can of soda may seem harmless, 
but it could actually lead to death.
One in 100 deaths of obese people internation-
ally is linked to the consumption of sugary drinks, 
according to a recent presentation at an American Heart Association scientific conference.
This information did not surprise 19-year-old 
UF health science sophomore Courtney Brady.
“I always assumed that fat people drink soda 
every day which contributes to why they are fat and die,” she said.
But she, too, sometimes indulges on blue 
slushies from gas stations. However, she does not think people in general realize how extreme the consequences of drinking soda daily can be.
“People think, ‘oh, it’s just a drink,’” Brady 
said.
Margarita Torres, a registered dietician and 
professor at Santa Fe College, agrees. It is easy to forget that liquids contain calories, too, she said.
The repercussion of drinking a 64-ounce foun-
tain soda can add up to 700 calories, according to Harvard’s School of Public Health.
It is imperative to remember that one pound 
is equal to 3,500 calories, Torres said. If someone drinks one 700-calorie drink each day, it can add up to more than one pound a week.
“It’s literally liquid sugar,” Torres said.Anne Mathews, a registered dietician and an 
assistant professor for UF’s Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, does not think sugary drinks are the only problem.
“The main problem is the lack of focus on 
overall diet quality,” she said.
Jacob Weiss, a 21-year-old UF building con-
struction senior, does not think this news will change his soda-drinking habits significantly.
“I am not obese, so one soda daily isn’t a big 
deal,” he said. “I know it’s unhealthy, but it can’t be worse than drinking alcohol.”
Mathews said it is vital to promote the health 
benefits of drinking water instead of sugary drinks. There are natural ways to sweeten bever-ages, including lemon juice in water and honey in tea.
“Consume everything in moderation,” she 
said. “That is the most important thing.”Study links soda 
consumption todeaths in obeseALYSSA NIEVES

The second annual Viva Europe! festi-
val will highlight about 15 European coun-
tries Saturday on Bo Diddley Community Plaza. 
The event, which runs from 11 a.m. to 4 
p.m., is free and open to the public.
Gail Keeler, UF’s Center for European 
Studies outreach coordinator, said people can watch and join in on Irish, Greek and Turkish dancing. 
Every hour, there will also be sing-
alongs in various European languages.
Local vendors will be selling traditional 
European food.
“Last year, there wasn’t as much em-
phasis on having something to do,” Keeler said. “This year, we charged the student groups with thinking of activities that are more interactive, so somebody could take away a little piece of Europe.”
Olesya Dudenkova, a 23-year-old UF 
history graduate student assistant, said she 
will be writing people’s names in the Russian al-phabet onto nametags for keepsakes.
Keeler expects 2,000 
people to attend.
François Moschini said 
he is looking forward to partaking in French ac-
tivities. 
He also wants to gain a better under-standing of Eastern Europe.
“When we think about Europe, we 
don’t really think about Poland and other European countries that have less power,” said the 21-year-old UF French foreign exchange student studying international business. 
Keeler said the show will still go on 
Saturday despite the 50 percent chance of showers forecasted.
Moschini, determined to experience a 
taste of his homeland, said he won’t let the gloomy weather rain on his parade — or festival. Festival to bring taste of Europe to downtown Gainesville

UF, in partnership with the city of St. Augustine, officially 
opened a new historic attraction.
The attraction, Colonial Quarter, is a living history museum 
that spans across two acres. It gives attendees a chance to experi-
ence what life was like in St. Augustine in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.
The museum, which has been open since Feb. 15, held its 
grand opening March 15 to March 17. More than 550 people at-tended the private grand announcement. The announcement was intended to draw media and attention to Colonial Quarter.
Cindy Stavely, executive director for Colonial Quarter, said 
the museum will act as an academic activity for elementary school students and above. Since the opening, Stavely said visi-tors have been receptive to the new museum.
“Everyone is very pleased at the amazing transformation from what the area used to be,” she said.
The attraction was previously known as Spanish Colonial 
Quarter, which was a state-run program. It shut down in 1997 when St. Augustine’s preservation board closed, according to a press release from Colonial Quarter.
Linda Dixon, associate director of planning 
at UF Facilities, Planning and Construction Department, said UF became the managing agency for the property in 2010.
Dixon said UF essentially outsourced the 
project, which is on state-owned land, to a private company, Pat Croce & Company. The company currently owns the St. Augustine Pi-
rate & Treasure Museum.
UF is responsible for fact checking all of the information at the 
attraction, as well as basic building upkeep, among other respon-sibilities, Dixon said.
“This is a great example of a public-private partnership,” she 
said. “We’re excited that it has been pulled off in such a short amount of time with good partnering and contributions by many, many people.”UF opens historic museum in St. Augustine

UF students looking for a healthier heart can add ex-
tra-virgin olive oil to their next meal.
Dr. Ramon Estruch, a professor of medicine in Barce-
lona, found that a diet characterized by Mediterranean 
foods is more effective in warding off heart disease than a simple low-fat diet.
According to the study, Estruch and his colleagues 
found lower risk of heart disease among their test sub-jects when they ate more olive oil, fish and poultry with meals. 
Seeing these results have some local experts suggest-
ing the diet as well. Anne Mathews, a registered dietician with UF’s department of food science and human nutri-tion, said most of the foods in the diet lead to decreased risk of diabetes, cancer and heart disease.
Although some foods in the diet contain fats, Mathews 
said they can be beneficial to cardiovascular health in controlled portions.
“They’re not foods like a triple scoop of ice cream 
with a brownie on the side,” she said.
Wendy Dahl, another registered dietician with UF’s 
department of food science and human nutrition, said when it comes to cardiovascular risks, the Mediterra-nean diet will be more beneficial than just a low-fat diet. However, Dahl said she believes Americans will have a hard time following the diet because they are constantly on the go.
“You’re not going to be able to go through a drive-thru 
and get a meal with extra-virgin olive oil,” she said.
Brittany Wallrath, a 19-year-old UF civil engineering 
sophomore, recently started following the diet by eating chicken and fish instead of red meat as well as substitut-ing breads and chips with fruits and vegetables.
“I kind of took the saying ‘you get out what you put 
in’ to heart,” she said, “and started to really pay attention to what I was putting in my body.”Study shows

Students dominated the conver-
sation Thursday afternoon as the UF 
Board of Trustees’ first day of meet-ings came to a close.
Several UF students spoke in fa-
vor of the committee on educational policy and strategy’s recommenda-tion that the trustees authorize the addition of an African-American Studies degree. Then they sat to-gether in the audience and grinned at each other when the committee passed the item.
The board will vote to finalize the 
decision today.
Student Body President Tj Vil-
lamil took the floor. In his Student Government update, Villamil said he’s proud of how far the 800-mem-ber body has come in the past year.
In the external relations commit-tee meeting, University Police Chief Linda Stump addressed the recent incidents at the University of Cen-tral Florida, where a man died by a self-inflicted gunshot. He was found with a bag of explosives and plans to attack the campus.
Stump said the situation turned 
out like it did largely due to emer-gency responders’ quick thinking.
“It still comes down to humans 
make the decisions,” she said. “As much as you can support keeping the University of Florida Police De-partment as a progressive, respon-sive, manpower-intensive unit, the better off I think you’re going to be.”UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said that in an emergency, UF would integrate communicators across campus to get the correct informa-tion out as fast as possible.
“We have developed a mass 
emergency ... plan in the past few years, knowing that anything like what happened at UCF could hap-pen here at any time,” she said.

◗ SEVENTY-TWO PERCENT GET 
NEWS FROM FRIENDS/FAMILY.
BETHANY SCHUSTER
Alligator Contributing Writer
A special report from the Pew Re-
search Center’s 2013 State of the News 
Media found 72 percent of Americans commonly receive their news from their friends and family.
“Word-of-mouth has been popu-
lar ever since man exited the cave,” said UF journalism assistant professor Norman Lewis.
Surprised the number wasn’t high-
er, Lewis said news is who people are; it’s something they constantly share in conversation.
And Americans are doing so, but 
revamped throughout the digital plat-form. Fifteen percent of Americans said they receive their news from fam-ily and friends on social media, and 7 percent said they do so by email. 
UF public relations sophomore 
Lauren Yockey said she is learning a lot about the value of social media to the news industry.
“Because [social media] is in 
our lives so much, it’s really easy to ‘click’,” the 19-year-old said. “It’s like instant gratification, but the informa-tion has the potential to be false or misleading.”Although the majority of news 
people receive may come from a short conversation or tweet, more often than not, they eventually seek out the full story.
The study found about 70 percent 
of Americans follow up their news very or somewhat often, especially if it was sent via email or social media.
For the news industry, this is an ex-
citing but difficult step.
“It’s all an undiscovered country,” 
said Ronald Rodgers, a UF journal-ism associate professor. “This is their opportunity to start discovering how these things can be used, to create a symbiotic relationship between the 
publication and the conversation.”News spread most by word-of-mouth

MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.

Aldo Rincon was alone during Panama 
Canal excavations in 2008 when he found a 
20-million-year-old tooth.
The 33-year-old UF geology doctoral stu-dent would later find part of the extinct hippo-like species’ lower jaw in the canal area. The expansion of the Panama Canal has led UF researchers to discover fossils revealing new information about Rincon’s hippo-like species and a crocodilian species of caiman.
With these, researchers were able to pub-
lish studies in March’s Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, clarifying the origins and distri-bution of caimans and the hippo-like species. 
Rincon, lead author of the hippo-like spe-cies article and co-author of the crocodilian species article, said the mammal was about the size of a cow with the proportions of a hippo.
Jonathan Bloch, Florida Museum of Natu-
ral History associate curator of vertebrate paleontology, said the fossil discoveries pro-vide evidence on how the diversity of animals came about when North America and South America were not connected.
Alex Hastings, the lead author on the croc-
odilian article, said the discovery provided information on a time period that researchers did not have before.
“[The fossil] kind of confirms ideas that 
we had about evolution in the new world in North and South America that we just didn’t have before,” said the former UF vertebrate paleontology graduate student.
The fossils are being held at the Florida 
Museum of Natural History for analysis. Rincon said this is just the beginning of fossil discovery in the canal.

The Gators took off for Nash-
ville, Tenn., on Thursday morning 
for their first Southeastern Confer-ence road matchup this season. 
When Florida (10-12, 1-2 SEC) 
opens its series against Vander-bilt (19-3, 3-0 SEC) Friday night at 7:30, it will find a Commodores squad that owns the No. 2 spot in the Baseball America Top 25.
Awaiting UF is an offense that 
ranks first in the SEC with 49 sto-len bases. 
Florida is tasked with keep-
ing Vanderbilt runners from tak-ing advantage of a young battery. Sophomore catcher Taylor Gush-ue has thrown out 25 percent of attempted base stealers this year, and Florida ranks fourth in the SEC in stolen bases allowed.
Three Commodores have 10 
stolen bases this season. 
“I’m totally excited. I can’t 
wait,” Gushue said.
 “The pitching staff and me 
have to work on that one. It’s not just me. It’s also the pitchers as well. We have to be on the same page all the time.”
A .304 team average and a .413 
on-base percentage offer Vander-bilt ample opportunity for action on the bases. 
But that’s not the case for Flor-
ida. Given their lack of consistent hitting, the Gators cannot afford to give away outs on the base paths. 
UF recorded back-to-back hits 
in only three of 26 innings against UK.
Florida’s 9-4 victory against 
North Florida on Tuesday marked the first game the Gators led from start to finish. 
Justin Shafer and Zack Powers 
executed a double steal of second and third in the seventh. 
It’s been a struggle making 
moves on the bases. With Ken-tucky up four runs, left-hander Cory Littrell picked off Connor Mitchell in the third inning of the series finale. Florida didn’t plate a run despite having three hits in the inning.
“The problem with our offense, 
quite frankly, the last couple weeks has been we’ve fallen behind,” O’Sullivan said.
“When you fall behind three 
or four runs, it’s hard to open up your offense, because you can’t make any mistakes on the base paths.”
UF facing top rotation: Freshman 
right-hander Jay Carmichael (2-1, 1.90) makes the second Friday start of his college career. He will face junior left-hander Kevin Ziomek (5-0, 0.92), who has 51 strikeouts in 39.1 innings. 
O’Sullivan promoted Carmi-
chael to pitch series openers prior to facing Kentucky. Carmichael responded by matching a career-high 5.2 innings on Friday. 
Junior right-hander Jonathon 
Crawford (0-3, 4.94) takes on for-mer Toronto Blue Jays draft pick Tyler Beede (5-0, 0.84) Saturday night at 7. 
O’Sullivan has not announced 
a starter for Game 3 on Sunday. 
Freshman right-handers Eric 
Hanhold (0-2, 7.71) and Tucker Simpson (1-1, 4.91) are two likely candidates to face sophomore left-hander Philip Pfeifer (2-0, 2.01) on Sunday at 1 p.m. 
Simpson earned the first vic-
tory for a Florida starting pitcher with his career-high 5.2 innings on Tuesday. 
The freshman approached 
Whitson and junior right-hander Keenan Kish, who is out for the year with a hip injury, about how to prepare for his first conference road series.
“Just expect for the unexpect-
ed,” Simpson said of the advice he received from Whitson and Kish.
“You never know what is going 
to happen from minute to min-ute.”

After falling behind Florida International 
11-1 to open its first-round WNIT matchup, 
Florida needed someone to kindle the of-fense. 
Sydney Moss provided the spark.The freshman guard, who came into the 
game averaging 10.6 points per contest, scored 12 points in the first half as the Gators clawed back to within two after 20 minutes.
Florida (19-14) rode Moss’ career-high 28 
points to a come-from-behind 75-68 victory against Florida International (19-13) Thurs-day night at U.S. Century Bank Arena in Miami.
“We had a few folks that definitely came 
to play,” coach Amanda Butler said. “Syd-ney having a career game tonight – we need-ed it.”
Florida came out flat for much of the first 
half. Florida International held the lead for the entire first half. The Gators got within one with 11:40 left in the half, but the Pan-thers went on a 13-3 run for the next five and a half minutes.
“There’s a lot of things that if we had 
time, we’d work on them and go and cor-rect,” Butler said. “But we don’t have time. It’s survive-and-advance time of year. We’ve got to play a much, much better ball game in this next round.”
In the second half, the Florida offense 
came alive.
Down 40-38 with 17:58 left in the second 
half, Moss led the Gators on an 18-9 run that gave Florida the lead. Moss scored 10 during the run, despite missing two free throws.
But the Panthers would not go down 
without a fight.
Led by junior guard 
Jerica Coley, Florida Inter-national charged back, ty-ing the game with 2:43 on the clock. 
Coley dominated the 
Gators’ defense, scoring 37 points on 9-of-24 shoot-ing and an 18-of-18 effort 
from the free-throw lineup.
But with the game on the line, guard Ja-
terra Bonds took over. 
The junior scored five points in the final 
2:21 of the game, sealing the Gators’ vic-tory.
“One of [Bonds’] nicknames is ‘J.T. Mon-ey’, and that’s why,” Butler said. “She lives for those moments. She’s that type of com-petitor. There is no one on our team that our team wants more on the line in that situa-tion.”
Bonds finished the game with 19 points, 
one of two Gators to finish with double-digit points.
Florida will play Winthrop in the second 
round of the WNIT on Monday.
“We know we’re playing Winthrop, and 
that’s all we need to know,” Butler said. “It doesn’t matter when, it doesn’t mat-ter where, it doesn’t matter what time. We know who our opponent is, and that gives us something to focus in on.”

UF survives outburst from nation’s leading scorer in win
butler
JOE MORGAN and PHIL HEILMAN

Quinton Dunbar does not feel 
threatened by Loucheiz Purifoy 
practicing at wide receiver dur-ing spring practice.
The junior, who led Florida 
with four touchdown catches last season, views the arrangement as an opportunity.
“I don’t take it personally,” 
Dunbar said. “I feel like it’s an opportunity to get better and an opportunity to push myself. I feel like I can beat out anyone. I take it as a challenge, I can’t speak for anyone else.”
With Purifoy returning to cor-
nerback after Saturday, Dunbar will be the lone standout among Florida’s top five returning wide-outs.
Dunbar enjoyed a banner year 
in 2012. He set career-best num-bers with 36 catches, 383 yards and four touchdowns. Still, Dun-bar tied for 25th in the Southeast-ern Conference in catches and ranked 35th in receiving yards.
UF’s returning wideouts com-
bined for 44 catches, 426 yards and four touchdowns in 2012. Take away Dunbar’s statistics, and the numbers drop to eight catches for 43 yards and zero scores.
Dunbar believes that the de-
velopment of junior quarterback Jeff Driskel as well as a second year in offensive coordinator Brent Pease’s scheme will be ben-eficial to the receiving corps.
“A year into the system helps 
all of us knowing that we’ve al-ready been through the system one year and all we’re doing is continuing to grow,” Dunbar said.
Dunbar has proven especially 
productive after a year under the former Boise State offensive coor-dinator.
Pease said Dunbar has stood 
out among other wideouts in spring practice.
“I am really proud of that kid,” 
Pease said. “He has come along so far attitude-wise, accountabil-ity, his work ethic on the field. It’s really starting to show up. He makes a big play yesterday. He just does things right. He can play a bunch of positions now. So proud of him and I think it’s going to carry over to reach the goals that he’s setting for him-self.”
Driskel said Dunbar and Flori-
da’s other receivers have all been motivated to overcome a disap-pointing effort in 2012.
“It was obvious that we need-
ed better receiver play this year and they’ve done a great job so far,” Driskel said.
“I’m really proud of those 
guys. Obviously we have a long way to go but they’ve re-ally stepped up in the first couple practices we’ve had.”UF hopes to minimize penalties:  
Florida’s offense struggled to avoid penalties during Brent Pease’s first year as offensive co-ordinator.  
Given the amount of forma-
tions and shifts players were asked to learn in the system Pease implemented, the coaching staff tolerated some miscues that plagued a unit that struggled to move the ball with consistency. 
There will be less tolerance for 
mistakes next season. 
“We’ve got to find consisten-
cy,” Pease said.
“We did that at times last year, 
but probably not as much as we could have after self-scouting ourselves.” 
Pease counted 45 penalties 
called on Florida’s offense last season, 19 of which were false starts. 
Cutting down penalties — 
Pease said he hopes to see the Gators reduce their total by half — should help improve an of-fense that ranked 78th in scoring offense and 104th in total offense last season. 
“You’re still going to have 
some (penalties) because that’s just how kids are,” Pease said.
“But you’ve got to do a good 
job of navigating around it, deal-ing with some things, (and) un-derstanding how to get your-self out of it and keep kids in rhythm.”

No. 1 Florida was nearly flawless on 
the uneven bars in a high-scoring 198.125-
197.875 loss to No. 7 Utah on Saturday, a trend that has been consistent this season.
With Southeastern Conference Champi-
onships on Saturday, the Gators will look for similar production to spark a success-ful postseason run. 
Florida heads 
to Little Rock, Ark., with the highest score on 
bars in the NCAA. Boasting a season av-erage score of 49.465, Florida’s strongest rotation will bolster its chance against the conference’s top competition. 
Four SEC teams are currently among 
the nation’s top 10 — No. 1 Florida, No. 3 Alabama, No. 5 Georgia and No. 6 LSU.
Each is also currently among the eight 
highest performers on bars in the NCAA. Georgia’s Chelsea Davis and Brittany Rog-ers rank in the top 10. LSU’s Sarie Morri-son ranks sixth. 
And with the current SEC seeding, Flor-
ida will be competing in the second ses-sion that includes all three programs. As the top seed in its session, UF will compete in the Olympic rotation — vault, bars, bal-ance beam and floor – giving it an advan-tage with its quality events coming first. 
“Bars is a very good event for us,” coach 
Rhonda Faehn said. “We do have quality swingers.”
Three of Florida’s gymnasts rank atop the NCAA in the event – Mackenzie Ca-quatto and Bridget Sloan rank first with a 9.945 average, while Kytra Hunter is sev-enth with a 9.91. 
Caquatto, who suffered double-ankle 
injuries prior to the SEC tournament in 2012, will be at full-strength. As a sopho-more, she competed exclusively on bars but will now compete on three events. 
Her presence will help as Florida com-
petes without All-American Alaina John-son, who Faehn said should add more depth to an already strong rotation if she returns. 
Against No. 14 Minnesota on March 1, 
Florida put together the nation’s highest score on bars with a 49.675.
“I think bars is one of those events that 
you have to get comfortable with,” Bridget Sloan said. “My bars routine, for me, I am very comfortable with it.” 
Competing for Florida, Sloan said her 
routine has seen a decrease in skills. Dur-ing her Elite career, Sloan performed 23 skills on her bars routine. Now, that has been reduced to just 13. 
But the freshman standout is not disap-
pointed in the transition. 
“I’ve cut it in half, and it’s nice to take 
a step back because when you’re Elite you get drained.”
Florida’s bars rotation will remain criti-
cal on Saturday.
Added Mackenzie Caquatto: “Know-
ing that we have that one event that we’re very strong at is definitely a confidence booster.”Florida’s uneven bars effort to play key role  in SEC title meetfootbAll

Katie Medina needed to make a 
tough play.
In the first inning of Florida’s 
game against Tennessee on March 
16, Volunteers shortstop Madison Shipman lofted a fly ball into foul territory behind third base.
Medina ranged over to field the 
pop up, but overran the ball. The seemingly sure out instead tipped off the end of Medina’s glove and landed in foul territory.
Shipman struck out later in the 
at-bat, but Tennessee struck for a run in the inning, which provided key insurance in its 3-1 win.
Medina’s defense was lacking 
in the series. Although the foul pop up was not recorded as an official error, Medina was charged with three against the Volunteers dur-ing the weekend, and her fielding percentage dropped to .916 — the lowest on the team.Her infield defense will need 
to improve for No. 3 Florida’s (28-3, 4-2 Southeastern Conference) weekend series against Arkansas (21-10, 0-3 SEC).
But Medina’s weekend in the 
field was not a total loss. On Friday, Shipman doubled to right-center field. Medina cut off the throw from center fielder Kirsti Merritt and fired a laser to the plate, catching the runner out by a solid margin.
“That was a perfect, bullet strike 
from Katie Medina,” coach Tim Walton said. “It did change the outcome of the game. It was a great relay from Kirsti to Katie.”
The effect on the game was evi-
dent throughout the series as Ten-nessee runners stopped taking the extra base on balls hit to the out-field.
The team saw what poor de-
fense can do in its 11-0 win against USC Upstate on Wednesday. The Spartans committed two errors, including a miscue by second base-man Dana Landers that allowed the Gators to get on the board first. Florida did not commit an error on Wednesday.
“I thought they played great,” 
pitcher Hannah Rogers said. “You can’t have no hits without your de-fense working for you.”
Pitchers dominate: Rogers and 
sophomore Alyssa Bache nearly combined for a no-hitter against the Spartans on Wednesday. 
Rogers pitched four hitless in-
nings, striking out seven batters. The junior right-hander made quick work of USC Upstate, facing only two more than the minimum batters possible.
Bache came in and surrendered 
a leadoff double, but put the next two batters down with strikeouts and induced a ground ball to end the game.
“Nine strikeouts out of the 15 
(batters), we only had to make six outs,” Walton said.  Rogers will see more time in the 
circle this weekend against the Ra-zorbacks. The series starts tonight at 6 at Katie Seashole Pressly Sta-dium.“They’re a great team,” Rogers 
said. “They have great hitters up and down the lineup.”

The Gators have waited 363 
days to return to the Big Dance.
On March 24, 2012, Florida 
blew an 11-point lead during 
the second half of a 72-68 loss to Louisville in the NCAA West Re-gional Final. The defeat marked the Gators’ second straight Elite Eight exit.
Third-seeded Florida will try 
to get over the hump and advance to its first Final Four in six years beginning tonight at 7:27 against No. 14 seed Northwestern State in Austin, Texas, on truTV.
“Well, you know, sometimes 
when I just reflect on my career here, I had two chances where I should have possibly, could have possibly been to the Final Four. We just came up short,” junior center Patric Young said. “Can’t still linger on it. Can’t let it affect me in the future.”
On the heels of back-to-back 
trips to the Elite Eight, the Gators began the season ranked 10th na-tionally.
Naturally, Florida dealt with 
the burden of expectations throughout the 2012-13 cam-paign. A 7-0 start and early-sea-son routs of Wisconsin and Mar-quette thrust UF into the national spotlight.
“I think they’re good enough 
to win the whole thing,” Golden Eagles coach Buzz Williams said following his team’s 82-49 loss to UF on Nov. 29 in the O’Connell Center.
After their profile cooled with 
losses to Arizona and Kansas State, the Gators returned to the limelight, ascending to the No. 2 spot in the AP Poll after win-ning eight straight Southeastern Conference games by an average margin of 26.5 points.
“I think they will contend 
for the national championship,” guard Marshall Henderson said after Florida defeated Ole Miss 78-64 on Feb. 2. “I see them being No. 1 in the country by the end of the season.”
The Gators then fell on tough 
times.
Junior forward Will Yeguete missed six games after undergo-ing arthroscopic surgery to re-move bone chips from his right knee on Feb. 8.
Freshman guard Michael Fra-
zier II and junior forward Casey Prather were also limited by in-jury.
In a 64-58 road loss to Tennes-
see — Florida’s third defeat in its last four games away from home — the Gators used an eight-man rotation. Five guys played 29 minutes or more. The other three totaled 27.
“We don’t have any excuses. When we line up to play, we play,” coach Billy Donovan said after the loss in Knoxville, Tenn. “Was there fatigue? Sure. Were we small sometimes and got hurt with that lineup? Yes. But I always believe if there’s a will, there’s a way, and there are things you ought to be able to overcome. We went to battle with what we had.” 
Shorthanded Florida’s 5-3 
record in February trimmed its lead in the SEC standings to one game. But the Gators rebounded, clinching the SEC regular season title in a 66-40 win against Van-derbilt on March 6 and coming three points short of winning the SEC Tournament in Nashville, Tenn. Sunday’s 66-63 loss to Ole Miss in the SEC tourney final was Florida’s first dose of single elim-ination this year.
“You’re getting into finality. 
What you’ve got to be able to do in these situations and games is go out there and play with great freedom, great confidence. Just go out there and play,” coach Bil-ly Donovan said. “There’s always a level of nervousness, jitters, ap-prehension. It’s totally normal. You’ve got to play through some of that stuff.”
Florida has struggled in close 
games. The Gators are 0-6 in games decided by single digits this season. After losing in the Elite Eight the last two seasons by a combined seven points, Florida knows it has little margin for er-ror moving forward.
“We just can’t have any slip-
page,” senior forward Erik Mur-phy said.
“We can’t have any mistakes, 
any dumb mistakes, or things that can give teams opportunities to beat us.”
Young added: “If we get into 
similar situations as we were in the Butler and Louisville games, just give it more fight. Don’t let up until the final buzzer rings. When that’s over, then you can finally rest, but stay on edge the whole time. … We have to close out games. We’ve got to stay fo-cused on doing our jobs.”
