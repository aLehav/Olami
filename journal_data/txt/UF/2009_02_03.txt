TOTAL DAMAGE TO THE HOUSE.

The Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority house was 
evacuated Sunday night after a window air 
conditioner caught fire. 
The fire, which started in a bedroom on the 
second floor, was quickly controlled by the sprinkler system in the house. 
“The sprinklers put out 90 percent of the 
fire, and the fire completely extinguished within minutes of Gainesville Fire Rescue arriving on scene,” said GFR spokeswoman Carol Davis.
Davis said that although there was about 
$1,500 in fire damage, the real damage was 
caused by the sprinklers, which totaled about $10,000.
After evacuation, the residents 
of the house were able to go back 
inside in small groups to get their belongings.
According to the GFR release, the residents 
were sent to the Reitz Union, neighboring 
sorority houses and friends’ houses and can 
move back into the house within the next cou-ple of days.

Two hopeful candidates an-
nounced their bids Monday for 
Gainesville City Commission seats that will open in March.
Robert Krames, 26, a Web de-
signer, has his eyes on the at-large District 1 seat held by Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa.
Marcia Wimberly, 50, a former 
social worker, faces Commissioner Scherwin Henry, who also wraps up his term for District 1.
Potential candidates must qual-
ify this week.
“We desperately need change in leadership in Gainesville,” said 
Krames, who moved to Gainesville 
at age 7. “There is a huge discon-
nect between the City Commission 
and the people of 
Gainesville and 
their needs.”
He said the 
commission of-ten ignores the opinions of city residents and cit-
ed the passing of 
the gender iden-
tity ordinance as an example.

While most of Gainesville 
was trying to stay warm and dry 
Monday afternoon, Carmen Cusack was lying on a giant mousetrap wearing only a bikini, heels and a 
pair of mouse ears.
Cusack, a volunteer with People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, 
was one of about a dozen activists who stood outside the Lowe’s on Northwest 13th Street from noon to 1 p.m. protesting the company’s sale of glue mousetraps. 
“All I could think about while 
I was lying there freezing was that there are mice all over Gainesville in the same position,” she said. “But PETA’s going to buy me lunch, and those animals are going to starve.”
The demonstration was one of 
five stops this week on PETA’s tour of Lowe’s stores across Florida and Georgia.
Animals stuck in these traps of-
ten suffer for days, eventually dying of dehydration and starvation, said Ashley Byrne, PETA campaign co-ordinator. Many animals chew off their own limbs in a desperate at-tempt to break free.
“Even kittens and hamsters have 
gotten stuck in them,” Byrne said of 
the traps.According to Byrne, Lowe’s is 
one of a shrinking number of stores 
who still sell glue traps instead of more humane options like box traps, which capture the animals alive and allow for release.
“Before we started this cam-
paign, we spoke to Lowe’s and 
asked them to take these products 
off the shelves,” she said, “but they refused.”
Lowe’s manager Tom Bragdon 
declined to comment on the demon-stration or Lowe’s’ position on glue traps.
Tommasina Miller, president of 
Animal Activists of Alachua, held 
signs along with other club mem-
bers in support of PETA’s cam-paign, but said she didn’t agree with its methods.
“Our philosophy is to educate 
and reach out to the public, which Animal rights groups protest mousetraps

Judge rejects Miami rock 
mining permits 
MIAMI (AP) — A federal judge 
has for a second time rejected per-
mits for large limestone mines near Miami.
U.S. District Judge William 
Hoeveler ruled the Army Corps of Engineers didn’t consider alterna-tives that would better protect the environment.
The mines would be near 
Everglades National Park and could potentially affect Miami’s main drinking water supply.
Hoeveler in 2006 also found the 
mining permits invalid, but was forced to look at the case again by a federal appeals court. The min-ing companies could also appeal this latest ruling issued Friday.

Student political parties contin-
ued the search for possible candi-
dates to fill their spring tickets on Monday.About 87 students stopped by 
on the second day of qualifying, hoping to be chosen to fill one of the 50 available Senate seats on each 
party’s ticket.
“(Monday) was slower than 
last year,” said SG Supervisor of 
Elections Dan Siegel, adding that the rain put a damper on student turnout. “But I’m expecting it to pick up.”Five of the seven registered par-
ties conducted interviews: Orange and Blue, Progress, Unite, Keg and LAN.
Both the Gator and Swamp par-
ties remained absent. 
Ten students 
registered with 
the Progress Party, 46 students reg-istered with the Unite Party and 14 students registered with the Orange and Blue Party, according to Siegel.
Other parties also snagged a few 
candidates. Three students regis-
tered with the LAN Party, while 
two students registered with the Keg Party. 
About 12 students remained un-
decided, Siegel said. 
Meanwhile, the Orange and Blue 
Party will announce its completed executive ticket today at 12:40 p.m. on the Reitz Union Colonnade. 
“I think the Student Body will be 
pleasantly surprised with our exec-
utive ticket,” Orange and Blue pres-
idential candidate Mark McShera said. “We have three candidates with strong resumes.” 
The last chance to interview is 
today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Room 284 of the Reitz Union.SG’s search for Senators ends today in Reitz Union

Continuing a semester driven by star pow-
er, February will be a busy month for Accent Speakers Bureau, the Student Government or-
ganization that brings renowned speakers to 
campus.  
The organization will host two nation-
ally known speakers this month, according to Accent Chairman Andrew Guglielmo.
Accent, along with UF’s Black Student 
Union, will present National Public Radio and Public Broadcasting Station personality Tavis Smiley on Feb. 12.
Smiley, who is coming to UF in conjunction 
with Black History Month, will speak at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
Accent will also co-sponsor self-esteem 
expert Jessica Weiner on Feb. 24 along with Gator Well, the Dean of Students Office and the Panhellenic Council. Weiner, author of several self-esteem books, will be addressing body image topics.
Accent usually brings in one speaker a 
month, Guglielmo said. A few more speakers are in the works, but 
Guglielmo would not share details on upcom-ing shows. 
Meanwhile, some students have voiced 
complaints concerning Accent’s lack of ad-vertising for last month’s speakers Mike Rowe and Jon Douglas Rainey, both hosts of Discovery Channel series.
But Guglielmo said Rowe’s popularity 
made it difficult to book a date far in advance, which slowed down spreading the word to students.  
 Guglielmo said he is looking forward to 
the rest of the semester and upcoming speak-ers. 
“This semester is a lot more fun and enter-
tainment-based than last semester, which was politically based,” said Guglielmo. “These are 
people you get to see on TV everyday.” Accent to bring famous, less political speakers to UFStudentGovernment

 ABOUT 300 PACKED THE    
RESTAURANT’S BACK PORCH.
By KATIE EMMETS
Alligator Writer
kemmets@alligator.org
Screams of “I love you” came from an 
audience of about 300 people as David 
Archuleta took the stage at The Swamp Restaurant Monday afternoon. 
Archuleta, the 18-year-old American 
Idol Season 7 runner-up, performed “Crush” and “A Little Too Not Over You” as part of KISS 105.3’s concert series.
KISS 105.3 chose The Swamp because 
it is a traditional Gainesville restaurant and a staple in the city, said KISS em-ployee Christian Chase.
Archuleta was scheduled to sing on 
the front porch of the University Avenue 
restaurant, but because of the rain it was 
moved to the second floor’s back porch.
“I love the rain,” Archuleta said. “But 
if you are in it too long you can get sick and that gets risky, especially if you have to sing.”
In the front row, Kelly Peterson, 13, 
sang every word to his single “Crush.”
“I love him,” she said. 
Kelly said she skipped school and her 
orthodontist appointment to attend the 
concert. Archuleta also posed for pictures, 
signed autographs and answered ques-tions from the audience. Because many of the songs on his CD are about love, one of the audience members asked Archuleta if he has ever been in love himself.
“I don’t think I’ve ever been in love 
before, but I have loved a lot of people,” he said. “I still need to mature. A lot of 
my friends think they are in love, and I 
don’t want to make the same mistakes as 
them. I am still waiting for that special person.”
Two women trekked 
from Orlando to see Archuleta perform.
Mirta Vila, 48, and Sheryl Radford, 
45, said they met on fansofdavid.com last 
year and have been best friends since.
They traveled together to Tampa to 
see Archuleta when he performed in the 
American Idol tour during the summer, and will be at a meet-and-greet tomor-row with Archuleta in Daytona.
“I’m not a teenager and I’m not a 
groupie, but if I had no children or re-sponsibilities, I would be following him 
around everywhere,” Vila said, wearing 
her David Archuleta sweater.
Radford said that Archuleta is the Tim 
Tebow of Music.
“Not only is he good at his craft, he is 
also a great role model and a good kid,” Radford said.‘Idol’ runner-up sings

Fifteen contestants danced in sparkling 
black dresses to kick off the Miss UF Pageant 
at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts Monday to a cheering crowd of about 500.
Paige Smith, the newly crowned Miss 
UF,  and Diana Kelly, the Miss Florida Gator winner, each received a $750 scholar-
ship and will go onto compete for the title 
of Miss Florida, according to the Miss UF Pageant Director Amanda Hall.
The Florida Blue Key hosted the event, 
which consisted of private interviews, on-stage performances and competitions in swimwear and evening wear. 
Shelley Meyer, wife of UF football coach 
Urban Meyer, was one of the masters of 
ceremonies facilitating the pageant and 
pumped up the audience with “Go Gators” during every intermission.  
The contestants shared their passion for 
organizations such as Gainesville Pet Rescue and Healthy Women, Healthy World.  
The participants displayed a variety 
of talents including a Broadway vocal, a Tahitian dance to “Bora Bora,” baton twirl-
ing to “Hot Hot Hot,”  a piano performance 
and a comedic monologue, all in hopes of being crowned Miss UF.
Lauren Beard, contestant eight, said be-fore her piano performance of “Chopsticks,” she kept telling herself, “I’m not nervous anymore. I practiced this a thousand times. There’s no point in being nervous any-more.”
They were judged by Miss America-
certified judges as well as Jeanna 
Mastrodicasa, Gainesville city commis-
sioner and UF’s assistant vice president of student affairs. 
According to Amanda Hall, director 
of the event, 35 percent of the contestants’ score was from the talent portion.
“This is not just a beauty contest. These 
are normal girls,” Hall said.“These girls are leaders on campus representing a philan-
thropic organization that they support in 
the Gainesville community.” 
Brooke Helvie, Miss UF 2008, asked 
questions to the contestants and sang “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”
“The pageant gave me opportunities to 
touch people’s lives through my voice,” Helvie said. “It is a wonderful event that is great for the contestants and really makes a 
difference.”Judges crown new Miss UF

 THE WEB SITE OFFERS 
SUNKEN SHIP SEARCHES.
By CHELSEA KEENAN
Alligator Writer
Google users can now search 
the ocean depths thanks to a new 
feature of Google Earth. The fea-ture may even become a  handy 
tool in some of UF’s classrooms. 
“Google Earth has gotten peo-
ple interested in looking on the 
surface of the earth,” said Ellen Martin, an associate professor in UF’s geology department. “So now people might be more inter-
ested in the ocean.”
Google Ocean allows viewers 
to explore the ocean floor and its inhabitants, according to the Web 
site’s informational video. 
It also offers 3-D explorations 
of sunken ships, according to the Web site at earth.google.com.
Martin said Google’s new 
views provide access to areas of 
the ocean that most people will never see. 
She also called attention to its 
value as a teaching tool. 
“It’ll give students a better 
sense of what the sea floor looks like,” she said.
Martin said the program will be 
able to highlight different features 
of the floor, such as ocean ridges, 
trenches and under water volca-
noes, aiding students learning. 
Although Google Ocean will 
be useful for students and teach-ers, Martin said, it probably won’t 
be used to further research the sea 
floor any time soon.
“There is already a program 
that does that,” Martin said. “It 
seems to me that (Google Ocean) 
is more for the general public.”Google adds ocean exploration
I feel like simply holding signs can do,” she said. “I don’t 
think objectifying women or having (Cusack) lying around in the freezing rain is necessary.” 
Although Animal Activists of Alachua, an on-campus 
animal rights group, is not affiliated with 
PETA, the organization wants to encourage 
Lowe’s to stop selling the traps, Miller said.
Gainesville resident Mike Foust, however, 
said the demonstration was unique and effective.
Foust said that though he does use animal traps, the dem-
onstration would make him less likely to use glue traps.
“Any time you put a cute female like that out in the 
street,” he said, “you’re going to get attention.”Group says glue 
traps harm mice
discrimination on the basis of sexual iden-
tity in public facilities, allows people who identify themselves as transgender to use the public restroom of their choice. Those against the ordinance feel it gives sexual 
predators a free pass.
Mastrodicasa, Krames’ opponent, sup-
ported the ordinance, which became  law in 
January of 2008.
“The City Commission is out of touch 
with the people of Gainesville,” Krames said.
He also listed other issues, including traf-
fic congestion and increasing utility costs, 
which he said is especially problematic for 
low-income residents.
Although this is his first time running for 
public office, Krames believes  he can get the job done.
“I just want to help make Gainesville a 
better place,” he said. 
This is also the first time Wimberly has 
run for a public office, but she has been in-
volved in politics before. She worked on 
congressional and local campaigns and in-terned with the Georgia State Legislature, she said.
A Gainesville resident since 2004, 
Wimberly said she wants to increase voter 
turnout by build-ing on the excitement President Barack Obama brought to po-litical involvement dur-
ing his campaign.
 “(Voters) seem to have a lot to say, 
but they may feel that no one will listen,” 
Wimberly said.
She hopes to sponsor a rebate for renters, which she said could benefit UF students. 
For property owners, she said she would support a tax credit to increase  residents’

Phelps disappoints fans,

Column
For the past 30 years, Western society has fun-
neled its best and brightest minds into the finan-cial sector. Harvard, Oxford and State U all sent 
their most illustrious stars into the wide-open galaxy of wealth creation, where the collisions of brainpower and avarice resulted in spectacularly profitable inventions like the now-poisonous derivatives market.
Real stars burn bright for far longer than our educated 
and privileged scions managed — so we must have just been shooting fancy fireworks up there. They exploded and wowed us all, but the empty shells came crashing down onto a rickety global economic structure.  
Regular folks got kneecapped by Wall Street, and 
suddenly the term “working poor” became a much larg-er umbrella. Finance is shaky and volatile even in the best of times, but this market is the crowning achieve-
ment of a whole generation of preeminent talent dedi-
cated to worthless fakery.  
What does a society do when its most valuable peo-
ple produce something of no value?
In Europe, the response has been to protest the gov-
ernment and do a little rioting. Mad at the banking sys-tem? Grab your finest bandanna and a hunk of concrete. Europe responds to the rapid degradation of living standards by inflicting damage on property, courting 
bloody noses with vital and angry dissent. 
Here in America, we listen to talk radio and blog like 
mad. A nation of “first-time caller, long-time listeners” 
and message board bombers are we, quick to forcefully opine behind the comforting mask of technology.  
This strategy works for us because, even now, we are 
at the top of the economic food chain. We can spend our way out of this regardless of what Europeans are screaming.  
Last week in Davos, the lead-
ers of the invested world stood 
up and said, “Not so fast, my 
friend.” Russian, Chinese and ma-jor European leaders made sure that President Barack Obama and 
the most influential senators knew 
that globalization isn’t just a fancy term.  
Most at Davos agreed that the creation of a “bad 
bank” to store our worthless crap investments is a good 
start, and they already know that we are quite skilled 
at creating bad banks. The hope is that we can clean up the messes our spoiled brat bankers made by hiding the mistakes in this bad bank, thereby encouraging the skit-
tish bankers to begin loaning money and spurring in-
vestments and inventions. This, more or less, would be a start for getting back to the very core of our society’s ostensible purpose. 
Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow Monday, which 
means that our winter of discontent is that much lon-ger this year. If we can yank our privileged financial sons out of their holes and convince them the shadow of their past mistakes are hidden away in these bad banks, 
we may be able to slog our way through a regular and 
healthy contraction inherent to market economics. 
However, solving the problem of a generation of 
fallen stars — and decades of lost potential — may be more difficult than riots or talk radio are equipped to 
handle.  
Tommy Maple is an international communications 
graduate student. His column appears on Tuesdays.In the wake of NBC’s 
decision to cut PETA’s risque commercial from 
the Super Bowl broadcast, animal cruelty awareness hit 
Gainesville on Monday.
At a local Lowe’s hard-
ware store, PETA support-
ers congregated in full force to protest the sale of glue mousetraps. The major issue with the glue traps stems from the fact mice often suf-fer significant pain before 
ultimately meeting their de-
mise.
Perhaps the most impas-
sioned among those in at-tendance was a bikini-clad young woman sprawled out on the ground. Not only was she scantily clad, she also sported mouse ears as rain 
fell on her all afternoon.
And who said Disney 
World was in Orlando?
Curious to find out why 
the commercial had been 
cut from Sunday’s program-ming, the Editorial Board did a bit of research and sought out the video online. What we discovered was nothing short of absurd (and 
awesome). Billed as “Studies 
show vegetarians have bet-ter sex,” the advertisement featured luscious lovelies engaging in lewd acts with vegetables.
Porn merchants every-
where had dollar signs in their eyes as suddenly a new 
fetish sprung up overnight.
As for the lady with the 
funny ears and swimsuit, we 
can only hope she takes com-fort in the mass of young men who will undoubtedly clip her photo from the Alligator to hang on their walls.
From Pamela Anderson 
donning an outfit construct-ed out of lettuce to our feline-fearing friend in Gainesville, adapting the mantra of “sex sells” seems to be a mainstay for PETA’s business model.In hiding behind his youth as an excuse for smoking pot, 
Michael Phelps demonstrated to the world a clear lack of understanding regarding his celebrity.
Simply put, there is no separation of lifestyles. Phelps, the 
world-class athlete who achieved Olympic immortality in Beijing, cannot coexist with his alter ego — the bong-hitting frat-boy wannabe.
With the fame of countless gold medals and dollar signs 
from corporate sponsorships, Phelps’ aura will quickly dissi-pate if he elects to play the role of Olympic icon only when it is most convenient for him. Whether he likes it or not, being Michael Phelps is a 24/7 operation that requires great fore-thought and care in maintaining his public image.
Sure, Phelps survived the public relations nightmare of 
committing a DUI back in November 2004, but he was 19 years old at the time. 
Clearly, to fault his youth in that situation doesn’t make 
up for the recklessness of his behavior, but there is a stark difference between being 19 and being a 23-year-old who should have understood his responsibilities by now.
The Editorial Board isn’t here to chastise Phelps for put-
ting his future sponsorships in question. The issue is not about money. 
What bothers us is the fact that he sorely let down his 
fans. In a time in which America’s top athletes routinely make headlines for steroid allegations, we thought we could have taken solace in Phelps’ resounding success.
The seemingly wholesome image of Phelps championing 
America on the grandest stage will forever be marred by his immature desire to have the best of both worlds.

Letters to the Editor
Unite Party is undemocratic
I have wanted to become in-
volved in student politics ever 
since I arrived at UF last fall. But when I got here, I had no idea that 
UF had different political parties, like Orange and Blue, Gator or 
Unite.
I read in the Alligator that the 
Gator/Unite Party (which I will 
refer to as the Unite Party because they are one in the same, a name 
change prompted by the scandals in the fall) was fixing interviews so 
that only applicants with certain organizational affiliations would 
be selected for positions. 
At Student Senate meetings, I 
observed time after time the Unite 
Party would select unqualified people over those with outstand-
ing credentials for SG positions 
because the unqualified ones had 
personal loyalties to Unite’s politi-
cal leadership. 
What I discovered was that the 
Unite Party tried to destroy minor-ity protection laws in the SG rules 
because their party leadership did 
not want to be questioned. 
It was very clear to me by the 
second Student Senate meeting that the Unite Party is extremely 
undemocratic.
At these same Student Senate 
meetings, I watched as the Orange 
and Blue Party tried to pass bills 
and was shot down every time by the Unite Party, even on blocking 
hand scanners, which 85 percent of the students disapproved of in the 
last election.
As a result, I became con-
vinced that the only way change 
would happen is if the Orange 
and Blue Party took over Student 
Government. 
It is for these reasons that I have 
interviewed to run with the Orange and Blue Party for a College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences senate 
seat at the Reitz Union on the sec-ond floor. They will be interview-
ing today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
I hope everyone interested in 
making Student Government as 
good as the quality of UF’s stu-
dents will come out.

3LSHome court lacks heart
I have one question — whatever 
happened to the Rowdy Reptiles? 
When I was a student at UF, 
the O’Dome was electric. It started 
when the doors opened and we raced down into our seats two hours before the game.
It didn’t matter that we had 
to wait a while for tipoff; we just had to secure our seats in the front row. 
A couple of times I think I even 
knocked over a couple of people racing down the bleachers! 
We always had fun. We would 
razz the opponents during warm-
ups and Lee Humphrey used to let us shoot three-pointers before the game.
Simply put, the experience was 
the absolute best.
Now that I have graduated, I 
still make it to every game. I leave 
my job and race to the arena, only to see empty seats just 45 minutes before the game. I can’t believe the “House of Horrors” has sunk to 
this level. 
It is terrible. We have a great 
team that already has 18 wins and 
we’re currently leading the SEC 
East. 
What else do the students want 
Billy and the boys to do?

I refuse to do it. 
This “25 things about me” list has 
taken over Facebook with everyone and 
their mother writing about themselves and 
tagging me. 
Do these people think I want to know 
if they are addicted to www.icanhascheez-burger.com? Wonder no more. I didn’t. Why do people feel the need to share things about themselves? Are they looking for ad-miration, a pat on the back, what? 
I refuse to relent simply because they feel 
like they need a spotlight. Don’t tag me if you’re looking for an audience.
The whole idea is egotistical. I’ve been 
told that people just want to share them-selves with others, but they really just want the attention. 
That’s what it’s all about and I refuse to 
acknowledge anyone’s “me list.”So, to the people who have participated in 
this facebook phenomenon: If people want to get to know you, they will. If you wrote this list because you felt like no one was in-terested in your life, take a hint; maybe your 
life isn’t interesting. 
Interesting people don’t have to advertise 
that they’re interesting. Maybe you should 
pick up a hobby or join a club. Maybe you should invest in other people. That’s a novel idea. Tagging people and obligating them to comment doesn’t count.
If you really crave attention, feedback or 
whatever, become another Mother Teresa. 
Do something productive and worthwhile 
with your time instead of devoting it to something about you. Why can’t we write lists about each other? 
We all spend enough time on ourselves. 
Why are we creating lists about ourselves? I can’t wrap my 
mind around the idea. Who do you think is going to read it? I’ve read two of them and 
I stopped less than 
a quarter of the way through out of bore-dom. 
I asked one friend 
why she did it, and she said, “Well I had to sound just as good as everyone else.” Why? Who are these people that you have to build yourself up for? 
 What happened to actions speaking 
louder than words? I determine the charac-ter of a person based on what they do rather than what is said or written about them.  
Every one of us is unique and has a lot more than this “25 things about me” list can offer. We need to take the focus off ourselves and shift it to the person next to us. Focus on the person who needs a friend or the person who dropped their books and needs help picking them up. Focus on anything but yourself. 
Our world accommodates far too much 
“me” thinking, and it has been to our det-riment. We are consumed with ourselves and have forgotten how far helping others can reach. The 45 minutes you spent writing your “you list” could have been spent vol-unteering at the St. Francis House or writing a letter to your local firefighters thanking them for their tireless efforts. 
You could have made a difference with 
that time. I encourage you to think about that the next time you get tagged in one of those “you lists.”

n A LAST-MINUTE SCORE 
DECIDED SUNDAY’S GAME.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA — Super Super Bowls 
are becoming a habit.
Pittsburgh’s 27-23 win Sunday 
night against Arizona was anoth-
er classic in an era of great games — “a game for the ages,” commis-sioner Roger Goodell called it.
Indeed, with a few exceptions 
(notably Ravens 34, Giants 7 in 2001) fans have been treated to a decade’s worth of rousing NFL championships.
Consider that the typical 
Super Bowl score from 1980-99 was 35-17.
But starting in 2000, when 
Tennessee’s Kevin Dyson was tackled a yard short of the goal-line with what would have been the tying touchdown in a 23-16 loss to St. Louis, the games have 
generally been what they were 
always supposed to be — worthy of their immense hype.
Six of the last 10 Super Bowls 
have been decided by a touch-down or less. Whatever the rea-son — luck, greater parity, nev-er-say-die teams — the NFL has reason to smile.
The Rams’ winning score 
against the Titans came on a 73-yard touchdown pass with 1:53 
to Isaac Bruce from Kurt Warner, 
who brought the Cardinals back from a 13-point deficit Sunday before the Steelers’ final drive.
Warner also had to watch 
from the sidelines in 2002, as Tom Brady drove the Patriots to the winning field goal against the Rams.
It wasn’t the only similarity 
Sunday to Super Bowls past. In some ways, this year’s edition mirrored last season’s.
The winning touchdown came on a pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds left in the game, the same time remaining as when the Giants scored to beat New England 17-14 a year ago. The Steelers’ game-winning drive started from their own 22 with 2:42 left in the game; the Giants’ 
drive began from their 17 with 
2:39 remaining.
Holmes was voted the game’s 
MVP with nine catches for 131 yards. It was redemption for him 
in two ways.
The play before his game-
winning touchdown on tiptoes, 
he had missed what seemed to 
be an easier throw on the oppo-
site side of the end zone. And in midseason, he was suspended for one game by Steelers coach Mike Tomlin after being found with 
marijuana after a traffic stop by 
Pittsburgh police.
“I learned a lot from that,” 
Holmes said. “I’ve grown a lot.”
Goodell added: “Santonio 
grabbed me as we were coming off the podium and said, ‘Thank you for believing in me.’”
Holmes’ acrobatics made a 
winner of Tomlin in only his sec-ond year as Pittsburgh’s coach.
The 36-year-old Tomlin guid-
ed the Steelers to an unprecedent-
ed sixth Super Bowl title. After 
a short night, he told reporters Monday he’s appreciating the Steelers and their fans more all the time.
“It’s generational,” he said. 
“It’s passed down from father to son. The more I’m in the organi-
zation, the more I understand it. 
It’s part of the fabric of people’s lives.”
It’s a game Pittsburghers cer-
tainly will remember for a long time. It might even have been the best in the recent run of title-game dramas, played out before an es-timated TV audience of 95.4 mil-
lion — second only to last year’s 
Super Bowl for U.S. ratings.TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 2009 n ALLIGATOR, 15

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison returns an interception for a touchdown as Arizona Cardi -
nals wideout Larry Fitzgerald tries to stop him during Super Bowl XLIII on Sunday in Tampa.
Steelers victory adds to decade of great Super Bowls
situations he can and cannot put himself 
into.”
The UF offense sputtered without 
Calathes, and by the time he re-entered the lineup, Tennessee had already solidified 
a lead that would prove too much for the 
Gators to overcome.
“Every team has got a guy like that,” 
Donovan said. “I don’t know if they were in shock, but there’s no question that tak-ing him off the floor definitely changed our team.”
If UF hopes to cement a place in this 
year’s NCAA Tournament, the Gators will 
have to find a way to run their offense, at 
times without Calathes.
“That’s the first time all season that 
we’ve had to play without him — without the ball in his hands,” forward Chandler Parsons said.
Parsons is the man who might be able to 
fill the scoring gap.
Since missing the free throw that led 
to UF’s loss in its last meeting with South Carolina, the sophomore has scored in double figures in four straight games and is averaging 17 points per game. 
“I’ll never forget about that the rest of my life,” Parsons said. “I definitely want to play those guys again.” 
CALATHES HAS SAID NO TO GREEK PRO CLUBS: Calathes revealed Monday that 
he received professional offers when he traveled to Greece this summer to try out for the Greek Olympic team.
Calathes said the offers were from small 
clubs and added that he didn’t take them 
too seriously.
“I told them it was a situation where 
coach Donovan knew I would be back here. They all knew,” Calathes said. “I love Florida, and I want to play here and for coach Donovan.”
While Calathes hopes to one day pursue 
a career in the NBA, he said he welcomes the opportunity to play overseas.
“At the end of my four years, there are 
always options,” Calathes said. “It’s great 
to have options, but right now I’m just 
thinking about right now.” 
When asked if he intended to stay at UF 
for all four years of his eligibility, Calathes backed off his initial statement. 
“End of four years, or whenever it 
ends,” Calathes said. “It’s not on my mind right now. (I am) just trying to win a cham-pionship at Florida, trying to compete for 
an SEC championship.”Calathes turns down pro offers
UF’s potential. He might be right, but the 
sophomore had 7 points against Tennessee after going for 18 versus Georgia. 
Others have mentioned Erving Walker 
as the key. Or Chandler Parsons. Or Walter 
Hodge.
All of this has led me to only one line 
of thinking since UF’s embarrassing loss in 
Knoxville.
Maybe this team doesn’t have a tipping 
point.
The Gators don’t seem one “moment” 
away from being great. 
Maybe the pieces just can’t mix for some 
reason. There seems to be a good amount of talent, but it’s just not working.
There are many times when it seems 
there is only one thing keeping UF together — Nick Calathes.
The sophomore guard continues to 
show why he is one of the premier players in the nation, despite the fact that he plays on a not-so-great team right now. He holds 
two of the three triple-doubles in school 
history after last week, and we all saw how out-of-sync the Gators were when Calathes went down with foul trouble early in the Tennessee game.
He still managed to be the game’s lead-
ing scorer. 
Calathes alone might be the difference 
between this 18-4 team being 14-8. The sophomore ranks eighth in the nation in as-sists (6.5 per game) and comes in at 71st in scoring (18 points per game). 
While that ranking seems low, con-
sider that of the top 15 scorers, only three reside on teams ranked in this week’s AP poll (Blake Griffin, No. 2 Oklahoma; Tyler 
Hansbrough, No. 3 North Carolina; James 
Harden, No. 24 Arizona State).
But to really give you a good crystal-ball 
prediction for the UF men’s hoops team, I turn to another, more-famous Phil, who just so happened to come out of his hill on Monday.
I’m talking about good ol’ Punxsutawney 
Phil, of course.
And locals say Phil is never wrong 
(cough, cough … just like this Phil, right?).
In his 124th year of forecasting the 
weather, the groundhog saw his shadow and predicted six more weeks of winter.
I guess the Gators won’t be getting that 
spring awakening any time soon.HOOPS , from page 16 PHIL , from page 16Sports

POLL QUESTION MEN’S HOOPS AP POLL TODAY IN UF SPORTS HISTORYHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF forward Chandler Parsons shoots during the Gators’ 80-65 win 
against the Razorbacks in the O’Connell Center on Jan. 17.

When South Carolina’s Zam Fredrick beat the buzzer 
to top UF 70-69 on Jan. 21, he delivered the Gamecocks’ 
biggest win to date.
But even he couldn’t have predicted the jump-start his 
layup gave to the South Carolina program.
Since their win against the Gators, the Gamecocks (16-4, 
5-2 Southeastern Conference) have reeled off four straight victories, including a thrilling 78-77 win against Kentucky on Saturday.
South Carolina now joins UF and Kentucky in a three-
way tie for first place in the SEC East.
The Gators (18-4, 5-2 SEC) will get a chance to try to 
pull away from the Gamecocks tonight when they take the floor at 9 in the O’Connell Center.
“Going to (Kentucky) and winning, beating us at home 
in a close game, right now they have every right to be a confident team,” UF coach Billy Donovan said.
UF comes into the game off a disappointing 79-63 loss 
at Tennessee on Saturday that cut the Gators down just as they had started to build momentum in the conference.
“We responded well after the South Carolina game 
against Vandy,” Donovan said. “I thought we responded well playing against Georgia. The big thing now is, can we come back? How we respond tomorrow will be very im-portant.”
When point guard Nick Calathes picked up two fouls 
in the first three minutes against the Volunteers, Donovan chose to sit the sophomore for most of the first half.
“I told him when he got his first (foul) that he needed 
to be careful,” Donovan said. “He has to understand what SEC East lead 
at stake vs. S.C.
The UF men’s basketball team’s 
recent loss to Tennessee got me 
thinking of an old saying:
“Fool me once, shame on you; fool 
me twice, shame on me.”
I’d edit the second half to say “fool 
me many times, shame on me.”
Because that’s exactly what keeps 
happening with people (includ-ing myself) who try to explain this men’s basket-ball team here in 
Gainesville.
It’s safe to say 
many people — 
writers and fans alike — approach 
the team as a guessing game. 
It seems the Gators have the pieces 
to be a decent team, but no one knows what will be the catalyst for them to put 
it together.
Some thought a heart-breaking road 
loss to South Carolina would do it. I’ll 
stop shy of pounding my chest too much, but as I predicted, comparisons to the football team’s loss to Mississippi were misguided.
I took a shot at guessing the X-factor 
in my column on Kenny Kadji on Jan. 20. 
I swung and missed there as the fresh-
man big man scored 18 points combined in the following four games. 
My fellow columnist Brian Steele 
pegged Alex Tyus as the key to unlocking Gators’ fate

n THE WIDE RECEIVER WILL REMAIN ON SCHOLARSHIP.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — Preston Parker’s trou-
bled football career at FSU is over after his sec-
ond arrest in less than a year.
Coach Bobby Bowden announced the ju-
nior receiver was dismissed from the team Monday in a one-sentence statement released 
by the school. Parker, who met with Bowden before the announcement, will remain in 
school on scholarship.
Parker, 21, from Delray Beach, was arrested 
and charged with driving under the influence after Tallahassee police found him asleep in 
his running car early Saturday.
The police report said Parker admitted he 
had been drinking and smoking marijuana. It was the third time Parker has been arrested since 2006.
Parker was suspended for the first two 
games of the 2008 season after being arrested last April in Palm Beach County on weapons 
and drug charges. One of the charges was a 
felony that was later reduced as part of an agreement on a guilty plea by Parker. 
He was sentenced to 50 hours of commu-
nity service, a year’s probation and weekly drug testing.
Parker was also arrested in 2006 after police said he tried to steal a DVD from Best Buy. The charge was dismissed after he entered a diver-sionary program and paid $200 in court costs.
Parker’s dismissal comes 
two days before national signing day, when major 
college football programs 
such as FSU unveil their lat-est recruiting classes.
FSU is also expected to 
hear from the NCAA on sanctions for an academic 
cheating scandal that resulted in the suspen-sion of more than five dozen athletes, includ-ing some football players.
Parker, who also saw some time at running back, caught 104 passes for 1,189 yards and five touchdowns in three seasons.
Parker’s dismissal, combined with Greg 
Carr’s departure after four productive seasons at FSU, means the Seminoles will rely heavily on underclassman wide receivers next season.
Taiwan Easterling and Bert Reed combined 
for 53 catches good for 617 yards and four touchdowns as freshmen last season. Reed, 
however, was suspended three times last sea-
son and arrested once for his role in a campus brawl in November that resulted in five receiv-
ers, including Easterling, being suspended for 
one game.
Parker was freed Sunday from the Leon 
County Jail on $500 bail. FSU’s Bowden kicks Parker off team after DUI chargeSEE PHIL, PAGE 15
