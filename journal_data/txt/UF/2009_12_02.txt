STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Senators send ROTC to Atlanta
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Staff Writer
Senators mixed talks of funding,
food and global politics at Tuesday
night's Senate meeting.
Unite Party Sen. Ben Meyers, a
member of the Food Service Advi-
sory Committee, said the committee
is considering converting the Alpha
Phi Omega information booth on
Turlington Plaza into a Jamba Juice
and Subway.
He said the booth could be ex-
panded to fit the restaurants. A con-
venience store could also be erected
in close to Turlington Hall near the
vending machines.
Meyers said students and em-
ployees of Gator Dining have
shown support for the idea and said
Capital Improvement Trust Funds
would be one possible source of
funding.
Meyers, who represents the
sophomore class, also met with Ra-
fael Yaniz, president of Gators for
Israel, and Husam Wahdan, presi-
dent of Students for Justice in Pal-
estine, to discuss the Student Senate
resolution affirming support for the
state of Israel.
Meyers said the resolution has
been revised and will be heard at
next week's Senate meeting.
"But have no fear, the contro-
versy will not be as bad as be-
fore," Meyers said, referring to the
lengthy debate that occurred when
the resolution was first heard.
The original resolution asked the
U.S. Congress to oppose the Gold-
stone Report, which accused Israel
and Hamas of war crimes during
last winter's Gaza Conflict.
Yaniz said the Goldstone Clause
has been removed from the resolu-
tion and replaced with a clause ad-
vocating for a two-state solution to
the Middle-East conflict.
"The idea is to show that the
students at the University of Flori-
da want peace in the Middle East,
and we want a two-state solutionto come out of this conflict," Yaniz
said.
A resolution is a piece of legisla-
tion that states the Senate's opinion
but takes no action.
Senators passed a resolution ad-
vocating a textbook rental program
catered to UF students.
Unite Party Sen. Eric Glickman
who represents District D, said the
high costs of textbooks lead some
students to consider them a luxuryrather than a necessity. He said
similar programs have been started
at Florida State University and Uni-
versity of North Florida.
Senators also passed a bill giving
about $2,700 for the Navy ROTC to
travel to the Southeastern Confer-
ence Championship and participate
in the color guard ceremony.
Close-Knit Gators, a charity
knitting and crocheting organiza-
tion, also received about $310.WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 3

Library extends hours
* MARSTON, LIBRARY
WEST WILL BE OPEN UNTIL
4 A.M. STARTING SUNDAY.
By NICOLE LYNN GREINER
Alligator Contributing Writer
With final exams looming like
a dark cloud on a sunny day, stu-
dents can seek refuge in the li-
brary a little longer than usual.
Starting Sunday, Library West
and Marston Science Library will
stay open until 4 a.m.
The library started its extend-
ed hours two years ago when the
Student Body president asked li-
brary administrators to keep the
library open later to give students
more time to cram for exams, li-
brary spokeswoman Barbara
Hood said.
Hood said 4 a.m. has worked
well for students and employees
in years past. She said most stu-dents tend to leave around 3 a.m.
but a few stick around until close.
In Spring of 2008,79,690 people
took advantage of Library West's
extended hours and 53,427 used
Marston during extended hours,
Hood said.
Study rooms will also be avail-
able, and librarians will extend
their live chat, which allows stu-
dents to ask them questions.
Students who may need an ex-
tra jolt of caffeine along the way
can stop by Starbucks in Library
West, which will remain open for
the extended hours.
The Starbucks in the Hub will
be open from 7:30 a.m. to 3 a.m.
The libraries will begin in-
tersession hours Dec. 17 from 8
a.m. to 6 p.m.
The libraries will all be closed
Dec. 25 to Jan. 3.
Hours for all the campus li-
braries can be found at uflib.ufl.

Students mail greetings to sick
By ERIN JESTER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Young cancer patients all over the country
will be getting a little extra cheer this holiday
season in the form of a greeting card. The UF
chapter of Friends for Life of America kicked
off its annual Hearts for the Holidays cam-
paign Tuesday on Turlington Plaza.
Stocked with armfuls of colorful paper,
markers, stickers and glitter, members enlisted
the help of students passing through to make
holiday-themed cards to send to children in
hospitals.
"It's a nice thing to do over the holiday sea-
son, giving back to people," said Sam Moltke, a
UF sophomore who made a card Tuesday.
Friends for Life, a national organization that
arranges events and fundraisers to benefit pe-
diatric cancer patients and their families, has
about 30 active members at UF, said Berna-
dette Guzman, a health education senior and
club president.
Of those members, she said about half of
them are involved with Hearts for the Holi-
days. The group pulls in enough volunteers to
produce 2,000 to 3,000 cards each year.
The goal of the campaign is to send holiday
cards to at least one hospital in every state.
Friends for Life keeps a running list of par-ticipating hospitals and tries to accommodate
them by making as many cards as possible,
since some hospitals ask for up to 250 cards at
a time.
Guzman said sometimes it's difficult to
make sure every state is covered and that there
are enough cards to go around.
Some sororities and fraternities get involved
as part of community service projects as well,
Hearts for the Holiday chair Larissa Roberts
said.
"It's a nice thing to do over the holiday
season, giving back to people."
Sam Moltke
UF sophomore
Roberts, a UF sophomore, became active in
the organization last year along with her sister,
who had cancer at the time. When her sister
died earlier this year, Roberts decided to apply
for the position of event chair for the Hearts for
the Holidays campaign.
"It's really close to my heart," she said. "I'm
trying to get everyone I can to participate."
The Hearts for the Holidays card-making
station will be open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.
through Friday on Turlington Plaza, and there
will be a Hearts for the Holidays booth at Gator
Nights on Friday.

APP, from page 1
an application created by Robert Gadala-
Maria, a 2008 UF graduate.
The application sorts contacts by area
code, recently added and region to ensure
an easier-to-use sorting process.
About 25 people have downloaded the
99-cent application from the Apple AppStore so far, but Gadala-Maria thinks more
people will download it once they know
about it.
"It's a pretty big problem," Gadala-
Maria said. "Like, when I would go out,
I would add people to my phone when I
was drunk and wake up the next morning
without knowing who I added."
He said it was a hassle to look through
all of his contacts in search of a particularperson and was surprised that the iPhone
didn't have a similar default feature.
Gadala-Maria, who currently writes
software for a New York in-
Student vestment bank, created the ap-
Life plication in two months while
working 50-hour work weeks.
For each download, Gadala-Maria re-
ceives 70 cents but will not be paid until
he makes $150 in sales.Gadala-Maria's biggest challenge dur-
ing the development process was get-
ting each area code and city in the United
States.
He plans to update the application with
a feature to organize contacts into catego-
ries and hopes to have the update avail-
able by January.

Blind Faith
U.S. should remain skeptical
about troop increases
his Tuesday night speech, President Barack Obama out-
lined his strategy for the war in Afghanistan.
"Afghanistan is not lost," the president began, in a Lyn-
don B. Johnson-esque commitment to escalate the war.
Obama's argument for the surge revolves around the notion
that Afghanistan and Pakistan are the "epicenter" of al-Qaida
activities. Preventing al-Qaida from again gaining a foothold
in the region, according to Obama, is critical to U.S. safety. He
called on Americans to unite behind this common purpose as
they did after 9/11.
But this is eight years later. We are not hastily responding to
an attack on U.S. soil.
Rather, this is a calculated decision that has been long in the
making -many would argue too long.
Blindly trusting the administration's judgment and uniting
behind this cause is not what the circumstances call for.
Obama's decision, if it can be implemented by a military al-
ready stretched thin, will send an additional 30,000 troops to
Afghanistan, bringing the U.S. troop presence in the nation to
more than 100,000.
Some on the Editorial Board are inclined to simply trust the
president; who could possibly be better informed on the issue?
But the fact is that Afghanistan is nothing more than a bunch
of unrelated tribes, loosely grouped together by a corrupt, in-
effective federal government. The Taliban is gaining strength.
Security has been deteriorating for years.
Okay, but what happens if we leave?
Yes, some of us at the Alligator are guilty of this line of think-
ing too. But "what happens if we leave" is no real excuse to stay
engaged in a war.
D-U-Idiot
Carlos Dunlap, Gatorsstar defensive end,
looks sad, resigned,
and a little pathetic in a mug
shot taken early Tuesday
morning after police arrested
him on one count of DUI.
His car sat idle through
several traffic light cycles,
and police say he appeared
to be asleep when they ap-
proached.
Gators coach Urban Mey-
er, calling Dunlap's actions
"stunning," announced that
he will not play in this Satur-
day's Southeastern Confer-
ence championship game.
This "very poor decision,"
as Meyer described it, is all the
more unfortunate given the
string of UF notables recently
arrested on DUI charges.
On Nov. 19, UF Home-
coming Queen Kristen Gillis
was pulled over at 2 a.m. after
running two red lights. She
was charged with DUI. Just
four days later, an inebriated
UF psychiatrist, Marcus An-derson, drove onto a sidewalk
and hit a law student, attempt-
ing to flee the scene afterward.
He was charged with driving
drunk and failing to stop after
hitting a pedestrian.
DUI charges may be noth-
ing new for students or fac-
ulty, but three front-page
incidents in two weeks is a
problem.
We love our party school
notoriety, but we love our
academic distinctions, too -
not to mention the safety of
pedestrians and drivers.
Drunken drivers place all
of these things in jeopardy,
and ultimately, prominent
figures like Dunlap and Gillis
bear more responsibility than
your average drunk, whether
they think it's fair or not.
Try to consider everything
you and your fellow students
stand to lose next time you get
behind the wheel -whether
you're front-page material or
not.
But especially if you are.

Lessons come from experience, not advice
ver Thanksgiving, I got to spend a week with my19-year-old sister, who's a sophomore at a state
school in the Midwest.
As she told me about her life, classes and friends, it
struck me how much of myself I recognize in her expe-
rience. As my college career is ending, my sister is just
hitting her stride.
I listen to her talking about studying for finals or reg-
istering for classes as I get ready to pick up my cap and
gown, and I want to tell her, "Slow down! This will only
last so long. Don't wish it away."
It's so great to see her coming into her own, and it
reminds me what that was like and also how hard it
was. College wasn't always easy or perfect, which I for-
get sometimes in a final semester that I've packed with
Wildlife Issues and football game weekends. Talking to
her makes me think back on all the fights I had with my
roommates, the classes I had to drop or how upset I was
when I couldn't come home one summer. Our conversa-
tions make me remember that I didn't used to have this
all figured out, back when every semester was a com-
pletely new and surprising experience.
There are the lessons I've learned that I want her to
somehow absorb by osmosis. I wish I could make her
understand that people don't always mean well and
that you aren't saved from pain simply by meaning well
yourself. I want to explain that not every friendship in
college is forever, not every decision is life-changing, and
not every class will determine your future.
I also want her to believe that she can have some of
the best times of her life despite the stress of figuring
out what you're going to do after the four years are up. I
want her to have fun and parties and boyfriends. I wanther to find her passion.
But, as my mom learned from
watching me, her oldest child, go
through my four years at UF -
these aren't things you can tell
someone. I had to learn by experi-Hilary Lehman ence, by having regrets, by lookingletters@alligator org back now and wondering where
the time went.
I feel like there's so much I've gained in four years,
and looking at my sister is like looking into a mirror -
but she's her own person. Her college experience will be
her own, not mine. And I'm having to come to terms with
the fact that mine is over.
I won't have another first football game or walk
around with a campus map. I won't discover new build-
ings or shortcuts. I won't make new friends in class or be
able to sit for an hour listening to my favorite professor.
She will.
So I'll watch my little sister go through it all, brag
about her accomplishments -she's drop-dead gor-
geous, an incredibly hard worker and is probably going
to graduate with her master's in the time it takes most
people to get an undergraduate degree -and be there
for her as she figures those things out for herself.
Seeing her all grown up has made me see that I'm fi-
nally a grown-up myself.
When I walk across the stage and receive my diploma
in a couple weeks, I'll be ready to move on. I hope my
little sister is at least inspired to enjoy the time she has
left.

Church sets bad example
Being accosted by crazies of alltypes, usually benign, is normal
in a college town like Gainesville.
However, when it's virulent hatred that
evokes remembrance of Nazis persecut-
ing Jews and other minorities, silence is
not always the best response.
Having learned that the message of
Jesus is love, not hatred, the attempts
of neo-Nazi-Hitler-youth types to force
hate literature on me was offensive.
First Amendment rights are one
thing, but public nuisance is another.
In any event, since I was standing wait-
ing for the traffic light to change, I told
them that they themselves are the devil,
since the word "devil" comes from the
Greek "diabolos" meaning accuser, and
it is they who are doing the accusing
with slogans like "Islam is of the devil."
Their presence would be visible were it
not that it was indicative that in bad eco-
nomic times, these fascist, bigoted hate
groups like the Ku Klux Klan or Dove
World Outreach Center (not a church)
will thrive, especially among the poorlyRobert Hewitt educated.
Of courseSpeaking Out Muslims im-
prove the social
fabric in America, but the "wolves in
sheep's clothing" trying to pass them-
selves off as Christian believers do not
acknowledge that.
This is a time in history critical for
bridging cultural gaps, not widening
them.
I'm not a Muslim, but I know one
can't judge a religion by a few of its fol-
lowers. If that were the case, I'd say that
that all Christians are fascist bigots or
terrorists.
Timothy McVeigh or bombers of
abortion clinics do not make me think
all Christians are terrorists.
Islam is about being good people, do-
ing good work and submission to God.
It's apparent that anyone who claims to
be a Christian should find a connection
with that, rather than antagonizing it.
So peace be with you, everyone.

Gainesville gives alumni warm welcome
Last Saturday's festivities were a tre-
mendous send-off for a unique senior
class. My wife hadn't been back to the uni-
versity in 16 years, and the students and
fellow alumni we met were all very friend-
ly. We got to tour the dorms still there, the
Heavener complex, and met Alberta at a
volleyball game.
I also want to really compliment the Al-
ligator podcast led by the efforts of Adam
Berry. Listening to these podcasts twice a
week has been a perfect way to keep up
with what's going on in UF sports and
Adam, Kyle, Mike, Phil, Bobby and the
other cast of characters maintain the in-
dependent spirit that marks the Alligator
newspaper. The senior football players
are not the only ones performing at a high
level; kudos to the Alligator staff, as well,
and all the other friendly students we met
this weekend.

Alligator should have reported on crash
I am curious as to why there was no
mention in the Alligator of Bernie Ma-
chen's hit-and-run incident and subse-
quent criminal charges. He received a no-
tice to appear in court on a misdemeanor
charge after hitting a parked car and not
leaving insurance and contact information
as required by law. Something like this is
newsworthy, especially given the fact that
he refused to admit fault until police got
involved and escorted him back to the ac-
cident scene.
The charge was eventually dropped
after he agreed to pay a fine and restitu-
tion to the victim. However this incident
should have been reported because it
displays the hypocrisy and false sense of
entitlement in which the president of the
university sees himself. He still has yet to
issue an apology or explanation for not
upholding himself to the same standards
he works so hard to set for everyone else.

Gators should set better example
You drink, you drive, you lose. lose
the Southeastern Conference?
I do not renounce any statement I have
made in previous letters: a DUI is a bad
mistake. No one gets into his or her car
drunk with intentions to harm another
person. I am confident that Gators defen-
sive end Carlos Dunlap did not drink and
drive with intentions of putting our foot-
ball crown at risk. I do hope that because
Dunlap cannot play in the SEC champion-
ship, and because this could possibly af-
fect all of our SEC football hopes, that this
incident helps bring home the point that
drinking and driving hurts everyone.
A DUI is not just an expensive fine, and
not just the front page of the Alligator. A
DUI is a crime committed with the risk of
seriously hurting or even killing another
human being.
What will it take, Gainesville? Maybe
this is the lesson we needed.
First, Go Gators, then -let's all grow
up and start acting like some.

ME.
Blood screening keeps public safe
This World AIDS Day, I reflect on the
number of people in the U.S. and abroad
who contract HIV daily. It's a stagger-ing number. I also remember those who
are currently living with HIV, a disease
characterized by stigma and social blame.
While originally considered a disease of
gay men, many today are living with HIV
for reasons beyond their control -includ-
ing receiving tainted blood transfusions.
There are thousands living in the U.S.
alone who have contracted HIV unknow-
ingly through blood products. Who knows
how many more have contracted it from
these unknowing hosts. It is important
to remember that in the world of public
health, screening -and rejection -can
be helpful things.
Note that since blood donation screen-
ing started, the risk of HIV transmission
through blood products has declined dras-
tically. Rejecting high risk donations is not
discrimination -it's safety.
Bear in mind that this "discrimination"
is not solely against male homosexual con-
tact. Donations are refused from those with
tattoos, piercings, organ donations, certain
drug and medical histories and those who
have traveled to countries with high blood
disease prevalence. That brings up another
point -HIV is not the only disease trans-
missible through blood contact. Screen-
ings also cover malaria, hepatitis, Chagas
disease and others.
Screening does not discriminate. It
keeps the public safe.
James Medley
UF health science senior
Dunlap should play in Saturday's game
While it is sorely disappointing to find
out about Carlos Dunlap's DUI, The Gator
Nation should not be quick to judge, and
he should certainly remain eligible for the
game on Saturday.
I'm looking at you, Urban. In fairness,
it was not Dunlap's fault -he thought he
was drinking water the whole night, but
Tim Tebow had turned it into wine.
Samuel Thomas
UF student
Author misinterprets Bible's message
This is in response to loulia Boyd's let-
ter, "Christian, liberal values OK."
It seems Boyd and I have a difference
of opinion. She may state what she thinks
being a Christian is all she wishes, but I'm
afraid that doesn't make it fact. She wrote
that "being a Christian means respecting
other points of view." In fact, it does not.
She mentioned the old law that made in-
terracial marriages illegal. Does that mean
that had she been alive in that time she
would have "respected" that opinion and
allowed such a law to stand? Of course not.
One may debate respectfully, of course,
but respecting another's opinions does not
mean backing down from what you be-
lieve is right, as in the case of abortion.
Also, I would love to see this passage
from Exodus that she mentions, as the
passage in Luke 1 clearly talks of John the
Baptist and Jesus as real human beings,
though both were still in the womb.
As for gay marriage, God does love all
people equally. He loves the lesbian as
He loves the priest as He loves the drug
addict as He loves me. But do you think
He loves the way the drug addict burglar-
izes a home to feed his addiction? Do you
think He loves the way I screw up because
I want to do what I want? No. In the same
way, He loves those who proclaim them-
selves homosexuals, but He doesn't love
their lifestyle. And it's not "a" verse that
says so, but many throughout the Bible.
Please look more closely.

UF responds in second half to avoid letdown vs. FAMU
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF forward Dan Werner looks to pass during Florida's 80-59 win over Florida A&M in the O'Connell
Center on Tuesday. He had a team-high 16 points and 9 rebounds.By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
On Monday, Florida coach Billy
Donovan said he wasn't sure if his
team deserved its new No. 13 rank-
ing. Tuesday night's game backed
up his gut feeling.
UF jumped out to a 14-point
lead against Florida A&M thanks
to eight early points from senior
forward Dan Werner, who finished
with a team-high 16 points and nine
rebounds.
But the Gators (7-0) let the win-
less Rattlers (0-8) hang around for
most of the first half, holding just a
four-point advantage at the break,
but UF came out strong in the sec-
ond half and put together a 23-4 run
that helped push them past FAMU
80-59.
"Here's the same team that beat
Rutgers and Michigan State four
or five days ago, and everybody's
talking about rankings," Donovan
said. "I'm not so sure we could have
been ranked in the top 300 with theway we played tonight."
Although the win kept UF un-
beaten on the season, the team still
took a step back from the three-
game stretch in which it strung to-
gether quality wins against Florida
State, Michigan State and Rutgers.
"Now, we're kinda back in
coach's doghouse," sophomore
guard Ray Shipman said. "It's bad
to be in coach's doghouse, but in
a way, it's kinda like a fire under
your tail trying to make you a little
bit better."
Donovan attempted to light a
fire under his players with 56 sec-
onds remaining in the first half and
his team on the wrong end of a
17-4 scoring run, subbing out point
guard Erving Walker for seldom-
used walk-on Kyle McClanahan.
"When he put Kyle in, Kyle was
doing all the things coach was tell-
ing us to do that we weren't doing,
and that kinda gave us a lift," Ship-
man said. "At halftime, coach said,
'Kyle came in and saw what needed

UF FOOTBALL
SEC Championship Game will showcase two great defenses
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
It's hard not to feel a little sorry for Tim
Tebow and Greg McElroy.
When the quarterbacks take the field
for Saturday's Southeastern Conference
Championship Game, they'll have to fight
through the two best defenses in the na-
tion.
It's time for them to find out how op-posing offenses have felt all season.
The No. 1 Gators and No. 2 Crimson
Tide are the SEC's top two teams in eight
of 11 defensive categories, and they both
rank in the top three of two others.
UF has the nation's best scoring and to-
tal defenses (UA ranks second and third)
while Alabama has the No. 1 pass efficien-
cy and No. 2 rushing defenses (Florida is
second and eighth).
The Gators have given up just 118
points (9.83 points per game), a numberthat would be lower if not for 13 points
allowed by the offense.
Likewise, the Tide has
allowed just 130 points
(10.83 per game), and 16 of
those came against special
teams and the offense.
But for all their simi-
McClain larities on paper, players
on the two units don't
know much about each other, as they
spend all their time in the film room study-ing offenses.
"I haven't kept my eye on Florida's de-
fense at all," Alabama linebacker Rolando
McClain said. "Obviously, they're a very
good defense because they dominate op-
ponents, or else they wouldn't be getting
the recognition they have been getting.
"I really don't know what they do. I
know they have very good players, I know
they're well coached, and I think we're
pretty much the same way."

Dunlap-se in judgment just one more distraction for Florida to overcome
he Gators have gotten usedto playing with distractions
this season.
From dealing with Dustin
Doe's preseason arrests to Lane
Kiffin to the flu-like symptoms to
Tim Tebow's concussion to Bran-
don Spikes' eye-gouging inci-
dent, Florida has had more issues
off the field than any undefeated
team should.
But the latest is one that could
have been avoided and should al-ways be avoided, but Florida will
be able to overcome it and still
win the Southeastern Conference
Championship Game on Satur-
day.
Even though Carlos Dunlap's
decision may not change the out-
come of the game, it was made
without much thought of the con-
sequences for him and more im-
portantly his team.

make it OK.
Dunlap is still only charged
with a DUI and not convicted ofanything, but it doesn't change
the fact that he got behind the
wheel of a car when he shouldn't
have.
Urban Meyer speaks about
how the team is a family and ev-
eryone on it is extremely close.
I am sure Dunlap could have
called one of his 107 family mem-
bers when he decided to start
drinking -or if he was just that
tired that he couldn't even make
the drive home without fallingasleep -and one of them would
have surely come to pick him up.
Dunlap has to have more sense
than to make that poor of a deci-
sion.
And of all weeks, he does it
a couple days before the biggest
game of the year.
It was a lapse in judgment, but
eventually he will be forgiven
and still drafted in the first round

UF's late comeback falls short
Butler blames lack of effort
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alligator org
Within the first four minutes
Tuesday, the Gators jumped out
to a 12-0 lead.
That was about the only
thing that made coach Amanda
Butler happy.
UF (3-4) lost to Florida A&M
72-71 and has yet to win consec-
utive games this season.
"We played a lot more hope-
ful than tough," Butler said.
"Hope is not going to win ball
games. Tonight, we didn't de-
serve to be wearing Florida uni-
forms."
In the team's fourth game in a
week, Butler said fatigue wasn't
a problem at all. The problem
was effort, or lack thereof.
"We shouldn't even use that
word (effort) in reference to
how we played," Butler said.
"If we're going to talk about ef-
fort, then we need to talk about
FAMU. Their intensity exceed-
ed ours."
The Rattlers (4-2) outran the
Gators and scored, more often
than not, on transition buckets.
The quick tempo kept UF guess-
BOBBY, from page 14
of the 2010 NFL Draft.
This doesn't just affect him though. It
affects his entire team, and it is his team-
mates that are left to play Alabama without
him.
The Gators have proven that they can
win without key players. They were with-
out Brandon Spikes for three games anding and FAMU shooting.
"We practice transition de-
fense and they're a very good
transition offense team, but it
just didn't matter enough to
us to get back," Butler said.
"FAMU shot the ball very, very
well tonight, but I felt like they
were open."
"Hope is not going to
win ball games. Tonight,
we didn't deserve to be
wearing Florida uni-
forms."
Amanda Butler
UF women's basketball coach
The first shot the Rattlers hit
was a 3-pointer, and it was omi-
nous.
Once the first bucket was in,
they steadily chipped away at
the Gators lead and took a 25-
23 lead.
Trading scores the rest of the
first half, UF took a lead into
halftime.
The first four minutes of the
second half were a complete re-
versal of fortune for the Gators,
who saw their lead diminish as
they fell prey to a decisive 14-2run that gave the Rattlers the
lead.
No matter how close Florida
came to tying, FAMU always
seemed to come up with a bas-
ket when it was absolutely cru-
cial.
Coming within three points
three different times in the sec-
ond half, the Gators failed to
come up with a game-changing
defensive stop when they need-
ed it.
When Lonnika Thompson
hit her two free throws to cut
the deficit to 58-55, the Rattlers
answered with a 6-0 run.
With less than a minute re-
maining in the game, A&M's
Bianca Cordero hit two free
throws that seemingly put the
game out of reach at 72-60.
Then the Gators teasingly
scored the next 11 points in a
row, capped off by a Jordan
Jones' 3-pointer with 1.5 sec-
onds remaining.
There just wasn't enough
time.
Rattlers coach LeDawn Gib-
son said in those waning mo-
ments, she only wanted to see
one thing.
"Can I please see three zeroes
on that clock? That's the longest
20 seconds I've seen," she said.
won all of them. Fellow starting defensive
end Jermaine Cunningham has missed two
games this year, and UF still found a way
to win.
Justin Trattou will again be called upon
to step up and start this time in Dunlap's
spot, and he might not have the same ef-
fectiveness as Dunlap but will still get the
job done.
The Gators' defense is good enough to
dominate games even without one of itsHarrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff

key players.
Alabama's offense is not a juggernaut
that UF won't be able to handle without
Dunlap.
The defense will still keep the Crimson
Tide's scoring to a minimum and give its
offense plenty of opportunities to win.
It will be more important that the Gators'
offense finds a way to score on Alabama's
great defense than it is for UF to figure out
how to play without Dunlap.Florida will still look like one of the best
defenses in the nation Saturday, but for the
next four days the rest of the players are
going to have to stay focused on the task at
hand despite the distraction hanging over
their heads.
Dunlap is just lucky that he didn't hurt
anyone and that his team is used to playing
with distractions so his Dunlap-se in judg-
ment won't cost the Gators their perfect
season.

McClain, Arenas, Cody anchor the nation's No. 2 total defense
But there's no question who leads Alabama's S FOOTBALL, -mpae1from page 14 defense. Where Florida has Brandon Spikes and

lels don't extend beyond stats on paper. McElroy sacks, and he serves as the head of the Tide's
said UF is just as fast and talented, but his squad scheme.has a more cerebral approach.
"As far as schematics, they're not nearly as
confusing as our defense, I feel," McElroy said.
"They have a lot of confidence in their defensive
backs and their secondary. And they do some
different things with their pass rushers in their
front. And they do a good job of mixing things in.
However, it's not overly complicated. It's mostly
based on a talent.
"So really as far as what our defense does and
their defense does, they're pretty different. Tries
to confuse you as opposed to trying to line up
and beat you with talent."
That doesn't mean Alabama doesn't have the
talent, though. Return man-turned-stud-corner-
back Javier Arenas and 365-pound defensive
tackle Terrence Cody are both ranked by ESPN's
Scouts Inc. in the top six at their respective posi-
tions for April's NFL Draft.
Cody controls the middle of the line with his
size, while Arenas relies on quickness and in-
stinct. Arenas is fifth in the SEC in tackles for loss
(12) and 14th in sacks (five), making him the only
defensive back in the top 20 in either category."I haven't kept my eye on Florida's
defense at all."
Rolando McClain
Alabama junior linebacker
"They change their defenses, they change
their blitzes, and when you do that you have to
be extremely intelligent," Tebow said. "Not a lot
of defenses are that sophisticated, and you have
to have smart people to run it. [McClain is] re-
ally that smart guy on their team that can really
get them in the right situation, the right place.
"And he's also not only is he extremely smart
getting people in the right place but he's a great
player, stout linebacker and athletic guy who
makes a lot of plays."
The clash between the Gators and Tide will
decide the SEC's champion, award a berth in the
national title game and probably go a long way
toward deciding a Heisman Trophy winner, but
it'll also give one of two proud defenses the right
to call itself the best in the land.Copyrighted Matesrvidr
