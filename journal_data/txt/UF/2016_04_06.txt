The annual Orange & Blue Debut will be 
held Friday night for the ﬁ  rst time.
The Spring football game is usually held 
on a Saturday afternoon, but it is being 
held earlier so the team can play at night, football coach Jim McElwain said. The Or-ange & Blue Debut, where half of UF’s foot-
ball team plays against the other half, will 
be Friday at 7 p.m. in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-dium. Admission will be free for everyone.
Flavet Field and the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center parking garage will be 
reserved for fan parking, according to the Florida Gators website. Flavet parking 
opens at 3 p.m., and the O’Connell Center 
garage opens at 3:30 p.m. Shuttles will also 
run from the Commuter Lot on Gale Lemer-and Drive starting at 3:30 p.m.
McElwain addressed the change in a 
press conference Friday. He said it would also prepare new players, who came to UF in Spring, for Fall games. The Fall season opener is usually at night.
“As you know, in the Fall we try to do 
different practices at different times sim-ply to prepare you for the different times you’re going to play during the day” he 
said. “So that’s part of it.”
He also said it would give the team 
more time to spend with recruits. 
“We can spend quality time with them, 
showing them the campus, the unofﬁ  cial 
visits, all the new things we have facility wise,” McElwain said.

CRIME
IT’S FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT 
AWARENESS MONTH.
By Molly Vossler
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students will march tonight  
to show sexual violence won’t be 
tolerated.
In honor of Sexual Assault 
Awareness Month, UF’s Sexual Trauma/Interpersonal Violence Education will host its fourth Take Back the Night march and rally from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the Plaza of the Americas.
Last year, the students marched 
almost 2 miles, starting at Norman Field, wrote Erin Smith, a UF psy-chology senior who’s attended the event for the past two years, in an email.Those who attend can share sto-
ries, make posters and listen to two speakers, said Rita Lawrence, an adviser for STRIVE and the inter-personal violence prevention coor-
dinator for GatorWell.
STRIVE, a peer education group 
at GatorWell, worked with UF’s 
LGBT Affairs and the University Police Department’s Ofﬁ  ce of Vic-tim Services to organize the rally. They started planning it in Decem-ber, she said.
Lawrence said sexual violence 
isn’t new, but more people are talk-ing about it.
“The rates have stayed the 
same, we’re just suddenly paying more attention,” she said. “This is a way to be a supporter to sur-vivors, to intervene when you see something weird going on and to take a stand against rape culture, which allows sexual violence to happen.”
Smith, a 21-year-old peer advo-
cate for the Ofﬁ  ce of Victim Servic-
es, said she’ll march today to bring 
change.
“I think it’s important to ﬁ  ght 
for something you believe in, and I think it’s important to demand re-spect,” she said. 
 STRIVE UF to hold fourth Take Back the Night walkBy Martin Vassolo

University Police is looking for 
a man they said assaulted a UF employee at the Reitz Union early Tuesday morning.
At about 6:40 a.m., a 49-year-
old administrative employee at the Reitz parked her car in the nearby garage, UPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Wayne Clark said. She then took an elevator to the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor.
As the elevator opened and 
the woman walked into an open area, a tall man wearing a white construction hat approached her, 
Clark said.
He grabbed the woman by the 
shoulders and held her against a 
wall outside the elevator, Clark said.
The man spoke to her in Span-
ish and then let her go, Clark said. He escaped through a nearby stair-well.
Clark said the man did not re-veal a weapon or indicate that he might have one. Employees from a nearby restaurant called police, 
according to an email sent to stu-
dents.
The woman later described her 
attacker as a tall, unshaven His-panic man with dark gray hair and a medium build, according to the email.
The email also stated he wore 
blue jeans, along with a hard 
hat and an orange shirt that read 
“Skanska,” the name of a construc-tion company that operates on campus.
Clark said detectives with 
UPD’s Criminal Investigations Di-vision will contact the company in search of the suspect.
“If we do ﬁ  nd him, we will take 
him to jail and charge him with battery,” he said.

“It kind of gives you a preview of next

more convenient because it wasn’t on a day with classes. She said she wouldn’t skip class

But Friday night won’t be as hot as last

HOSTED THE DISCUSSION.

Alligator Staff Writer
Students discussed how racism has set the 
tone for the next presidential election Tues-day.
UF’s Hispanic-Latino Affairs held Race to 
the Bottom, an impartial discussion on rac-ism and stereotypes. The student organiza-tion invited a member from both the UF Col-lege Democrats and UF College Republicans to talk about the roles racism and stereotypes 
play in the 2016 presidential election.
With about a dozen students present, they 
took questions from HLA and audience mem-
bers about the candidates, campaign meth-
ods and their campaign platforms.
Amy Mendez, who helped organize the 
event, said it aimed to help the UF commu-
nity tune into the elections on an impartial platform.
“As a minority community at UF, we just 
felt like it was important,” the 20-year-old UF finance sophomore said.
During the talk, HLA showed videos of 
Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz. After the videos, the audience and the panel-ists engaged in a Q&A discussion.
Richard El-Rassy, the president of UF 
College Republicans, acknowledged the ra-
cial tension in politics, but he said the issue 
comes from both parties.
“It’s not the political party itself that is 
using racial stereotypes, it’s members of the political party,” he said.
Natalia Perez Santos, the director of out-reach for UF College Democrats, said she 
hopes to see political parties meet the needs 
of citizens.
“As we continue to move forward, we 
have to push our parties to do better,” the 20-year-old UF political science and history 
junior said.
Fahad Khan said he decided to attend the 
event after seeing it on Facebook. He said the panelists’ collected demeanors set the tone for a civil atmosphere.
“I think that we got to see different per-
spectives on the issues,” the 20-year-old 
UF political science and history senior said. “Having these discussions, I think, is crucial to any democracy.”

UF Supreme Court might not be 
able to meet during the Summer.
At Tuesday night’s Student 
Senate meeting, senators chal-
lenged Student Body President Jo-selin Padron-Rasines’ nominations for the UF Supreme Court.
After she announced her ap-
pointments, which she chose Feb. 10, she was accused of not reach-ing out to more students and not considering more gender diver-sity. She nominated Kenneth Cun-ningham, a gay army veteran, and Adam Trumbly, the only Native-American student in UF’s second-year law class.
After her appointment failed 
to pass by majority vote, Padron-
Rasines said she was furious sena-
tors used diversity as a reason to deny the motion.
“I think it is disgusting that 
they used diversity for political 
gain,” she said. She added that she 
looked for qualified candidates, not “checkmarks” for a diversity quota.
She said she won’t have enough 
time to reopen applications and complete interviews before April 19. The next Student Body presi-dent, Susan Webster, will need to appoint new nominees.
Andy Schein, the chief justice of the court, will graduate this se-mester. Once he does, the court won’t have the minimum number of members to meet.
“I’m going to be real here for 
a minute,” Schein said. “The Su-preme Court here at UF is sup-posed to be a non-partisan posi-tion and a non-partisan body.”

UF students can see electric mo-
torcycles on the Plaza of the Ameri-
cas today.
UF’s Campus Earth Day celebra-
tion will take place from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. At the event, students can par-
ticipate in activities, games and hear from UF President Kent Fuchs.
The motorcycles are part of the 
University Police’s goal to make 10 percent of the campus fleet electric vehicles over the next 10 years, ac-cording to a press release.
Jacob Adams, the office manager 
of UF’s Office of Sustainability, said the annual event marks the 10th an-niversary of the office. To celebrate, they will hold information sessions about green tips students can follow.
Along with about 30 other UF 
organizations, Gators for Environ-mental Community Outreach and the American Water Resources As-
sociation will teach students about 
sustainability.
“We’re participating to promote 
our organization to a wider range of students who may be interested in learning more about water resources around our state,” said Emily Taylor, the 22-year-old vice president of the AWRA UF chapter.
Matthew Gonsiewski, a UF sports 
management sophomore, said he will attend Campus Earth Day because he recently vowed to improve his waste and recycling habits.
“I’m hoping that by signing the 
pledge, I will become more conscious of the environment and how my ac-tions can negatively affect it,” the

RESEARCH 
By Stephanie Belina
Alligator Contributing Writer
Katelyn Ward spent the summer of 2013 
doing research on marine biomechanics.
Thanks to a renewed grant, about 40 
more students will be able to participate in 
the Research Experiences for Undergradu-ates program at UF’s Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience for the next ﬁ  ve 
years. 
The grant will be for about $431,000 
and will allow the program in St. Augus-
tine to continue.
During the program, students will com-
plete a marine-focused research project of their choice, said Elaine Seaver, the pro-gram’s head.
The grant, which comes from the Na-
tional Science Foundation, funds the re-search program. Students who do research at the Whitney lab are paid and receive free housing, she said.
Seaver said she thinks it’s important 
to pay students, because she had to work during summers in college.
There are about 200 REU programs in 
the U.S., each researching a different topic.
About eight to 12 students are select-
ed for UF’s 10-week program each year, Seaver said.
She said she hopes to update the pro-
gram over the next ﬁ  ve years.
“Even though the program has been 
in place for a long time, a strength is that we’re always updating it depending on faculty, research interests and changes in technology,” Seaver said.
Ward, who now studies prosthetics and 
orthotics at Northwestern University, said the program helped her get in.
“I don’t know where I would be with-
out the program,” Ward said. “It’s incred-ible.”UF marine bioscience lab

Teddy bears, gift 
baskets: state of 
the Palin
Just when you think you’ve seen it all, life takes it all 
up a notch. Everyone knows this election season has not been unlike mint-ﬂ  avored Oreos: an endless cycle of frustration and disappointment. Yet, last week we may have ﬁ  nally witnessed the craziest accusation of 
2016.
Of all days, on April Fools’ Day, former Alaska governor 
and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin gave a speech at a Wisconsin GOP dinner. Amid her pro-Trump musings, Palin slammed the other establishment candidates on il-legal immigration by arguing they’re “actually asking for more immigrants, illegal immigrants, welcoming them in, even inducing and seducing immigrants with gift baskets of teddy bears and soccer balls.” Seduction by teddy bears and 
soccer balls: We’re as confused as you are.
Thankfully, this imagery didn’t just fall from the sky onto 
Palin’s speech notes — assuming she uses her notes (and 
if she does, who on Earth writes them?). Palin’s mention of teddy bears and soccer balls may have actually referred to when Fox News personality Glenn Beck and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., joined Beck’s relief group, Mercury One, in July 2014 to give $2 million worth of food, water, clothing and toys to immigrant children on the border.
Granted, Beck and Cruz may have ultimately concluded 
the children, in time, needed to be sent back home, but it’s nice to see acts of good from ﬁ  gures on the right over such an issue as illegal immigration. Even more shocking is how Palin, two years later, used the incident to pit candidates against each other.
Now in the spirit of fairness, before we dismiss her state-
ments as “jiggery-pokery,” we have to explore the possibil-ity of them having at least some validity. It’s not like a for-
mer governor and former vice presidential candidate would 
be rambling off sermons of utter nonsense, right? Perhaps Palin is addressing us in some sort of “National Treasure”-like code. Her apparent distress might be a low-key wake-up call. Let’s think through her record together.
She just highlighted the danger of teddy bears, and back 
in 2008, she referred to herself as a “mama grizzly.” Clearly she’s drawing our attention toward bears. Now, for those who’ve seen ﬁ  rst-hand in “The Revenant” the kind of dam-
age bears can do to our most beautiful actors (#prayforLeo), 
perhaps Palin’s hinting at a full-on bear apocalypse, an a-claw-palypse? No, that’s ridiculous: not as ridiculous as her speeches, but still ridiculous.
All joking aside, we can take a deep sigh of relief from 
this situation. We often hear that the world itself is at stake with this 2016 election, but Palin’s revivals are a sobering reminder of where we’ve been. For many of us students, Palin was our ﬁ  rst glimpse at a genuinely bafﬂ  ing politician. 
Oh, there’s nothing like the ﬁ  rst time. And even when the 
political climate was such that she might have been our vice president — and, thereby, potentially the president — we endured the storm. Now her support only continues to rap-idly dwindle along all party lines.
So should you ﬁ  nd yourself looking to the future in fear 
or uncertainty given the current state of our politics, take a moment to look back at our ghosts and remind yourself of our history and the capacity for good decision-making we 
have at our disposal.Boys gone wild: white male privilege and Greek life
Many want to write off Donald Trump as 
an aberration, a joke — what America isn’t. But I think The Donald’s success thus far within our “free market” and absurd election process,is a testimony 
to America’s values: deep-seated racism and misogyny. His popular support and misplaced recognition by erstwhile serious media outlets also evidences there are, indeed, many Ameri-cans who are little Donalds themselves.
I would also venture to guess the resurgence 
of widespread racism and misogyny we are witnessing is, in some part, a consequence of Obama’s presidency. One needs only observe the type of criticism 
received by Obama and his family to realize that for racist 
white males in the U.S., Obama’s authority was an affront to their egos and a harbinger of their doom.
Admittedly, I think Obama, while charismatic and suc-
cessful, still upheld the “free market” and the status quo and is somewhat selective in pulling the black card. De-spite this, he is still accused of being a Muslim radical who will declare martial law and conﬁ  scate all the guns — and oh, yeah: The U.N. is involved somehow. America’s 
greatness has been shattered, they assert with trembling 
pointed ﬁ  ngers.
Beliefs this deluded stem from mentalities under at-
tack, whether legitimate or just perceived. I am convinced the progress of the struggles for greater civil and human rights for ethnic minorities, women and non-hetero people has been nothing short of near-fatal blows for those who have historically beneﬁ  tted from the oppression and mar-ginalization of the aforementioned groups. We also can-
not forget that the struggle for rights and recognition never 
ceases, as the structures of white male privilege die hard.
Last semester, I wrote a column titled, “On a scale from 
one to frat…” in which I performed a discourse analysis of a sign on a frat house and asserted Greek life, with its gloriﬁ  cation of white masculinity and the objectiﬁ  cation of women, is inherently misogynistic and does not belong in a center of higher learning.Unsurprisingly, I was criticized for my beliefs 
and, much to my amusement, accused of using a thesaurus! Commenters asserted I couldn’t in-terpret popular culture, was putting words in women’s mouths and was “butthurt” because 
I didn’t get a bid. (Ask anyone who knows me: 
The image of me in a frat is painfully comic.)
I am thus taking this opportunity to consider 
those types of criticisms and hopefully reignite the crucial debate we need to be having about the role of Greek life at UF.
As our university is not an island but rather 
a microcosm of the whole country, we can assume it is a training ground for the world, our future careers and 
social interactions. I won’t make generalizations; rather, 
I’ll ask: What degree of accountability do the members of Greek life have? What privileges are they afforded that average students are not?
I ask further how UF should address countless studies 
such as one from The Guardian that shows frat men rape at disproportionate rates compared to non-Greek-afﬁ  liated students and sorority women are much more prone to rape than other college women.
Yes, the tendency to write off any pattern of behavior 
as a single series of aberrations or an isolated incident is the typical modus operandi of society, of which universi-ties are a crucial part. But I believe this comes up short in a disastrous way, and in an effort to curb the scourge of white male privilege in the U.S., it is necessary to get as close to the source as possible.
My hope is that our Student Body, as well as admin-
istration, may take a sobering look at the reality of Greek 
life within UF and how it serves as a continuation of an 
unfortunate and oppressive status quo.
Yes, boys will be boys. But that doesn’t mean we 
shouldn’t hold them accountable or that they shouldn’t suffer the consequences of their bad behavior.

opinions@alligator.orgWEDNESDAY, APRIL 6, 2016   ALLIGATOR   7
It is rare to find topics re-
garding morality and soci-etal values in the news. 
What is even more rare 
is finding such topics on 
ESPN, where depth and heavy 
thinking aren’t necessary and 
emojis are apparently substi-
tutes for words when describing sporting events.
The story I am referring to is 
of the lowly Los Angeles Lakers — specif-
ically two of their players, D’Angelo Rus-
sell and Nick Young. Last week, a video surfaced of Young talking about women, specifically the 19-year-old with whom he cheated on his fiance, Iggy Azalea. 
As it turns out, the video, which ap-
pears to have been covertly shot with an iPhone and without Young’s knowing, was filmed by his own teammate, rookie 
point guard Russell. 
ESPN and the entire sports media 
world did what any respectable journal-
ism outlet would do and pounced on this juicy story like lions on a fattened gazelle. 
It’s not often TMZ-caliber stories like this 
arise in the sports world, and you can’t blame ESPN for milking as many clicks as it could from it. 
However, the intriguing part is found 
in the way this entire fiasco has been pre-sented and spread. Every story has seem-ingly been about the dramatic divide in the Lakers locker room, with one side be-
ing Russell and the other being everybody 
else.
Stories began to arise about how poor-
ly Russell was being treated by fans and teammates. From other players leaving when he sat down at their table to eat 
(the stuff of middle-school cafeterias), 
to having his own “fans” boo him into oblivion at a home game, Russell had a rough week. 
Maybe he deserved it, but the share of 
shaming from Internet elitists has dispro-
portionately been sent in Russell’s direc-
tion, as if Young was only an innocent lamb caught in the crossfire.
Are we just going to pretend Young’s 
part of the story didn’t happen? A man admits to cheating on his current fiancée, yet most people spend all of their efforts shaming the person who got it on tape. Both play-
ers are at fault here, but I think 
ESPN, players and NBA fans have completely lost sight of the big picture. 
When two people commit 
immoral acts, can one be great-er than the other? If both are re-
vealed at the same time, is it inevitable that one will take priority over the other? 
Think about each side as if it were in a 
vacuum, happening independently. 
Russell getting caught jovially record-
ing his teammate while they hang out 
doesn’t make ESPN’s front page. 
Young cheating on his celebrity wife 
does. 
But no, in the NBA, being a teammate 
trumps remaining faithful to your partner. 
Apparently, fidelity to teammates is 
superior to that of women, and based on 
the behavior of the Laker’s locker room, being a snitch is worse than cheating.
Imagine an NBA in which Young is iso-
lated/polarized for infidelity to his fiance. In this scenario, I’m not sure what the reaction toward Russell would be. Praise him for revealing the truth? Or would we 
still shun him for not being a good team-
mate?
All in all, this whole story is just two 
professional basketball players finding 
themselves in a nasty situation gone pub-
lic. 
Both parties are wrong, but that does 
not play into the media’s need for a good guy/bad guy dynamic. The media and 
most consumers gravitate toward stories 
with defined sides: a hero to sympathize with and a villain to be upset at. 
The reality, however, is that some-
times this is not the case and is instead just a fabricated rule the media feels can apply to 100 percent of situations. It is entirely possible, as this story shows, for both parties to be at fault and, frankly, it 
would be nice if the media would portray 
it this way.

opinions@alligator.orgIn many ways, art could be 
considered the most impor-tant subject. Art expresses 
ideas and thoughts where 
words cannot, which is 
why it transcends any language and stands as its own form of 
communication. Children learn 
to draw and use Play-Doh be-fore they can write because art stands at the center of creativity. So it is important UF have an art museum where 
students can ﬁ  nd a source of inspiration 
when words simply don’t sufﬁ  ce. It’s called the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art.
The problem is that students’ views of 
the Harn are tainted early in their careers by the dreaded class What is the Good Life? At this point in time, partaking in the thoughts and experiences of humans 
across space and time is substituted for 
completing a worksheet. Good Life ruins what the Harn could potentially provide students during their times here. There-
fore, a visit to the Harn needs to be cut 
from the curriculum.
Whether students should be forced to 
go to the Harn for class really brings about 
a bigger question: Should all freshmen 
even have to take Good Life? However, there is a cavalcade of former and present students of the course who have a much 
stronger opinion on that topic, which is 
why this article only looks to salvage the Harn from the clutches of that class.
Proponents of a Good Life visit to the 
museum may argue the forced visitation brings people to the museum who would not go otherwise. Even if this were true, it forces a ﬁ  rst and last visit for many, 
formulating enjoyment in a small handful 
and instilling an unjustiﬁ  ed hatred toward the museum in the majority.
The Harn has a lot to offer. 
Among a wide variety of art-
work, it currently has a Monet 
painting on display. Monet is known as one of the most im-portant artists in all of history. 
His signiﬁ  cance alone could be 
a reason to visit the Harn. The museum also has free events, 
gardens and even art classes. However, merely mentioning the Harn only reminds 
many students of What is Good Life?, so it 
never occurs to them to visit the museum again. They might make us ﬁ  ll out another worksheet.
This week is the last week for current 
Good Life students to visit the Harn for credit. Hopefully it will be the last time freshmen will be forced to visit the mu-seum. If anything, students who take the 
course should be forced to visit the butter-
ﬂ  y garden at the Florida Museum of Natu-ral History, and visiting the Harn could be an opportunity for extra credit. Currently, 
it is the other way around, and anyone 
who has been involuntarily dragged to the Harn knows the best part of the visit is its proximity to the butterﬂ  y garden. While forcing students to go to the Harn may 
presently deter them from appreciating 
what art has to offer, it is very hard for any soul to feel even an ounce of angst in having to see butterﬂ  ies.
UF may want its students to develop 
an appreciation for art, which is probably why Good Life students are forced to visit the Harn. Nevertheless, forcing an appre-ciation for art upon college students is like 
an overpowering parent teaching art to a 
child for the ﬁ  rst time. As forcing Play-Doh into children’s faces will probably make them hate it, mandatory attendance 
to the Harn dawns upon the same emo-
tions. Like leaving paper and colored pen-cils on the kitchen table, as long as the museum is well-advertised, college stu-dents will eventually ﬁ  gure out for them-
selves all the Harn has to offer.

Two men and a woman from South 
Carolina were arrested Monday morning 
after Gainesville Police said they invaded 
an apartment and kidnapped a woman in 
a stolen car.
At about 11:30 p.m. Sunday, the group, 
led by an armed man, forced its way into 
an apartment, GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. 
Inside, the group tied up four people 
with duct tape.
Quintae Edwards, 23; Kwame Fer-
nanders, 22; and Kayla Black, 18; then ran-
sacked the apartment, stealing cash and iPhones, Tobias said.
They forced someone to withdraw mon-
ey from an ATM and then returned to the apartment, where they kidnapped a woman and stole a car, Tobias said.They later left the woman at North 
Florida Regional Medical Center, and GPD 
tracked the woman’s stolen iPhone, Tobias 
said. 
The suspects headed west along Inter-
state 10.
At about 3:30 a.m., deputies with the 
Leon County Sheriff’s Office found Edwards outside a hotel in Tallahassee, Tobias said.
Inside, they also found Fernanders and 
Black.
Police later learned the suspects stole a 
car to reach Gainesville and are persons of interest in a North Carolina homicide.Black was arrested on seven charges, in-
cluding the kidnapping of a minor for ran-
som. 
Edwards was arrested on charges of 
grand theft auto and home invasion. Fer-
nanders is being held as a fugitive from jus-
tice.
As of press time, all three remain in the 
Leon County Jail.

An Uber driver hit a pedestrian near 
campus Tuesday morning.
At about 10:20 a.m., a woman crossed 
Northwest 16th Street near UF’s campus 
when the Uber driver turned right onto West University Avenue and hit her, wrote Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias in an email.
The pedestrian, whose identity has not 
been released, suffered minor injuries, To-bias said.
He said the driver and the pedestrian 
then exchanged contact information. 
They planned to speak later about the 
incident, but witnesses called police when 
they saw the driver leave the scene.
John MacIsaac, a 22-year-old UF inter-national studies senior, said he saw the 
collision as he walked toward campus.
Upon impact, the woman rolled on the 
car’s hood and fell to the street, he said. 
At the time, MacIsaac said he couldn’t 
tell if the car had run over the woman.
A man who needed an Uber later en-
tered the car, which then drove away, he 
said. Officers arrived and called the driver, 
who was issued a traffic citation for failing 
to yield to a pedestrian, Tobias said. 
MacIsaac said the driver had a green 
light, but the pedestrian ultimately had the right of way.
He said paramedics came to treat the 
woman, but she didn’t seem critically in-jured.
“I think she’s just more surprised that 
she got hit by a car,” MacIsaac said.

Florida to play Duke at Madison Square Garden
The Florida men's basketball team will face Duke at Madison Square Garden 
during the 2016 Jimmy V Classic, according to Jon Rothstein of CBS Sports. LEFT-HANDER SCOTT 
MOSS EARNED HIS 
FIRST CAREER WIN.
By Patrick Pinak
Sports Writer
Dane Dunning needed just 
one pitch.
After Florida freshman pitch-
er Jackson Kowar loaded the 
bases with two outs in the sev-enth inning with a 4-1 lead over Jacksonville, UF coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan turned to Dunning to 
record a much-needed out.
On his first pitch, Dunning 
induced JU’s Parker Perez to ground into a fielder’s choice to 
shortstop Dalton Guthrie, who 
slid to his left and flipped the ball to second baseman Deacon Liput for the force out.
“He’s feeling confident right 
now,” O’Sullivan said of Dun-
ning. “And you can tell."
Behind the junior right-hand-
er and five other pitchers, No. 1 
Florida (28-3) defeated Jackson-ville 7-2 Tuesday night at McK-
ethan Stadium.
The win extended the Gators' 
program-record home winning 
streak to 28 games and improved 
them to a perfect 21-0 on their home turf this season.
And while Dunning induced 
perhaps the game's most crucial out, Florida starter Scott Moss was the main pitching attraction.
After not seeing any action in 
his first two years at UF because of elbow injuries, the redshirt sophomore earned his first ca-
reer win against the Dolphins.
Moss tossed three scoreless in-
nings, allowing no hits or walks while striking out four.
“Honestly I didn’t even know 
it was my first career win,” he 
said. “It means a lot to me. I’ve 
worked to get this far.”
The Gators pounced on JU 
starter Kyle Arjona, scoring two 
runs in the second inning.
Freshman Deacon Liput roped 
a double into the right-center 
field gap before coming around to score on Mike Rivera’s double 
down the left field line. 
Rivera trotted home a few 
batters later on Jonathan India’s 
sacrifice fly to take a 2-0 lead.
In the fourth, Liput set the 
table as Florida plated another pair of runs, this time off of relief pitcher Chris Gau.
Following Liput’s leadoff walk 
and a Jeremy Vasquez single, freshman Nelson Maldonado chopped an RBI single to left to score Liput from third.
Then, on a 2-2 pitch, India 
lined an RBI double down the left-field line to score Vasquez. 
Maldonado raced around third 
but was cut down at home on 
Jacksonville shortstop JJ Gould’s 
relay throw.
The Dolphins (17-11) waited 
until the seventh inning to score 
and threatened for more runs.Florida extends home winning streak, beats Jacksonville

IT'S COHEN DOWN
There was something nag-
ging Mike White.
As he talked about 
Kasey Hill and John Eg-bunu, about the former’s 
improvements and the latter’s injury-driven setback, as he talk-ed about the Southeastern Con-ference Tournament and Flori-da’s sudden loss to end it, there it was, in the back of his mind.
“I know the question is coming,” he said 
on Monday. “Was it a success?”
The last few weeks. 
His ﬁ  rst year at Florida. 
The season.“It’s never a success at the University of 
Florida if you don’t go to the NCAA Tourna-ment,” White said. “But I feel like we’ve laid a foundation.”
They have.Their foundation lies with KeVaughn Al-
len, the freshman from Arkansas who trav-
eled nearly 900 miles southeast to play for 
Billy Donovan’s replacement, and excelled. His 32-point performance against Florida State on Dec. 29 was the ﬁ  rst sign, spurring a freshman season that saw him ﬁ  nish second on the team in 
points per game (11.6).
It lies with their future front-
court in John Egbunu and Kev-
arrius Hayes, Florida’s 6-foot-11 center and 6-foot-9 forward, re-spectively, who each displayed 
their own brand of effectiveness this season.
In his ﬁ  rst year playing at Florida, Eg-
bunu acclimated to UF’s system quickly. 
In his ﬁ  rst year in college, Hayes improved 
each week, culminating in a National Invi-tation Tournament run where the freshman ﬁ  lled in for an injured Egbunu. 
In Florida’s last two games of the season, 
Hayes recorded a season-high point total (14) in back-to-back games against Ohio State on March 20 and George Washington on March 23.
The foundation also lies in freshman for-UF has bright future under White
TABOR, MAYE AND 
WILSON HAD 25 PASS 
BREAKUPS LAST SEASON.
By Ethan Bauer
Sports Writer
As Jalen Tabor and Quincy Wilson 
walked into Florida’s Indoor Practice Fa-
cility on Tuesday, teammate Marcus Maye 
made sure everyone in the building knew 
they had arrived.
“Jalen Tabor and Quincy Wilson, ev-
erybody,” he said, his voice echoing up 
and down the hollow building.
But his introduction, while courteous, 
was unnecessary.
Tabor and Wilson — along with Maye 
himself — are already proven, well-known commodities in UF's defensive backﬁ  eld.
Last season, the trio was responsible for 25 pass breakups — the rest of the 
team combined had 29 — and grabbed eight of Florida’s 14 interceptions.
But in addition, the Gators also had 
NFL-Draft-pick-to-be Vernon Hargreaves, senior nickelback Brian Poole and hard-hitting safety Keanu Neal roaming the sec-
ondary.
All three are now gone.
Without counting other departed play-
ers or Tabor, Wilson and Maye, the rest of the team was responsible for only 10 pass 
breakups and had no interceptions in 2015
Who will ﬁ  ll the void alongside the trio 
in 2016?
Junior Duke Dawson seems like a likely 
candidate to replace Poole at nickel back, 
and he expects as much.
“I’ll be starting at nickel,” he said.“I’m rotating in at corner as well.”Defensive backs group looking

ward Keith Stone, who redshirted 
his ﬁ  rst year on campus to develop his body, his skillset and to ob-serve, and whose progress has ex-cited White.
More often than not, after losses 
and after subpar practices, Florida’s coaching staff could only wish they had Stone available.
“Boy if we just had Keith last 
night”, White and his staff said. 
“Things will get better when we get 
Keith.”
And it lies in White, the rookie 
Florida coach who isn’t really a rookie coach, who accepted an of-fer at UF to replace a legend, to 
overcome expectations that landed 
near an NCAA Tournament appear-ance.
He defeated then-No. 9 West 
Virginia at home, albeit without the Mountaineers starting forward, and played NCAA tournament teams Michigan State, Miami and Purdue close on the road. His 21 wins in his ﬁ  rst year were more than those of the two Florida coaches who pre-ceded him in their ﬁ  rst years, Lon Kruger and Donovan. 
And he did it all with an inher-
ited team, who he had little time to scout, whose trust he had to earn on the ﬂ  y, whose abilities he had to improvise with to navigate the nation’s 11th-ranked strength of schedule.
“We know these guys better,” 
White said. “But we have a ways 
to go as a team, as a program, in 
terms of getting back to where we want to get to.” 
But if there is one thing this sea-
son has proven, it is that Florida is close. 
White has a full offseason to get 
there.
Ian Cohen is the sports editor. 
Contact him at icohen@alligator.org and follow him on Twitter @icohenb.             COLUMN,  from pg 13Defensive backs coach Torrian Gray 
said he's been happy with Dawson’s prog-
ress and noted that he’s seen him improve 
in spring.
“Duke’s been awesome,” he said. “He’s 
explosive, a very good player… I tell you, 
I’m excited about Duke’s progression.”
But beyond Dawson, question marks 
surround the secondary. 
Wilson mentioned teammates who 
have played well this spring — Marcell 
Harris, Nick Washington, McArthur Bur-nett and Chauncey Gardner — but didn’t sound too inspired about where the team 
is at corner right now.
“There’s not really that much depth,” 
he said, “so we all gotta stay healthy.”
At safety, Harris and Washington will be counted on to step in and ﬁ  ll Neal’s old 
spot alongside Maye. 
The two have underwhelmed during 
their time in Gainesville, but coaches 
seem to be gaining con-ﬁ  dence in them.
And at corner, while 
depth is lacking, Tabor 
believes that the younger 
guys will step up when the time comes.
“They’re looking real 
good,” he said. “A lot 
of people don’t know about them yet be-cause of obviously who they got in front of them, but (they) are really going to be pretty good once they…  get their oppor-
tunity.”

ebauer@alligator.orgFOOTBALL,  from pg 13Dawson said he'll start at nickel
Jacksonville’s first two hitters reached 
base on a single and shortstop Dalton 
Guthrie’s error. 
Then JU catcher Franco Guardascione 
cut UF’s lead to 4-1 on an RBI groundout to shortstop.
When Jacksonville loaded the bases 
on a hit-by-pitch and walk with two outs, UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan pulled Kowar in favor of Dunning.
Dunning shut down the Dolphins’ 
rally on his one pitch, killing any hopes 
Jacksonville had of tying the game. 
In the eighth inning, Dunning sur-
rendered a run after Seth DeWitt singled 
home an RBI to bring JU within three.
But in the bottom half, Maldonado ex-
tended Florida’s lead to 7-2 with a two-run home run to left field. 
The Tampa native finished 2-for-3 
with three RBIs and now has five homers, which ranks third on the team.
Maldonado said he felt confident after 
a sluggish weekend.
“My weekend didn’t go as well as I 
wanted it to,” he said. 
“I stuck back to the cages and got my 
timing back and my swing back.”
With a five-run cushion, junior Shaun 
Anderson closed the door in the ninth in-ning, tossing a scoreless frame.
Florida will continue its homestand 
with a three-game series against Missis-sippi State, starting at 5:30 p.m. on Fri-day.

Florida coach Mike White calls out instructions during UF's 88-79 loss to Kentucky on March 1 in the 
O'Connell Center.T abor
By Brian Lee
Sports Writer 
For the first time in a year, the 
Florida softball team is no longer 
No. 1. 
After a lackluster series against 
Alabama in which the Gators dropped two of three games, only scored four runs and recorded 13 hits, the team fell to number No. 2.
“I think losses can help hum-
ble you,” junior Delanie Gourley said. 
“You never have to stop work-
ing. You never have to get rid of that … drive to win, and so I think losses can help get you back there.”
Offensively, the Gators (34-
3, 9-3 Southeastern Conference) struggled mightily against the Crimson Tide (31-7, 5-4 SEC) and 
their ace, junior Sydney Little-
john. 
She proved to be a riddle that 
Florida’s hitters could not solve, 
allowing a lone run and scatter-
ing seven hits over 13.1 dominant 
innings. 
“We just made mistakes,” 
coach Tim Walton said. 
“And when you make mis-
takes, you give up runs, whether they’re pitches, whether they’re 
defensive plays (or) offensively.” 
Sunday’s 3-0 defeat marked 
the first time Florida has been 
shut out at home in two years. “We just weren’t able to re-
ally get much going. Didn’t have 
any clutch hits hardly at all, and 
I thought overall they just out-played us,” Walton said. However, one of the few of-
fensive bright spots this weekend was cleanup hitter Amanda Lo-renz. The freshman went 4-for-8 with an RBI in the series. 
After experiencing a slump at 
the commencement of conference play, Lorenz — who is currently riding a four-game hitting streak — raised her batting average to .404, second best on the team. 
“We learned a lot about our-
selves this weekend,” she said. 
“It’s just motivation to work 
harder and we’ll see how we re-spond to it.”
Florida does not have much 
time to figure things out, as it faces UCF tonight at 6 in Orlando. 
Historically, though, the 
Gators have experienced success 
against the Knights, compiling a 
17-4 all-time record. 
Since the start of 2013, Florida 
has won 116 of 118 non-confer-
ence matchups — a staggering 
.983 winning percentage — and 
is 27-1 against in-state opponents since 2014.  
The matchup with UCF is the 
first stop on a four-game road 
trip. The Gators will also travel 
to Oxford for a series against Ole Miss this weekend. 
“It’s a long season,” Walton 
said. 
“Last year at this point in time 
we were 8-4 (in conference play), this year we’re 9-3, (five) years ago we were (6-6). So I think 
we’re really not in a bad position. 
“I’ll take that every time.”
