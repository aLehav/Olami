Skyler Mornhinweg is hit while he attempts to throw a pass during Florida’s 37-7 loss to No. 2 Florida State on 
Saturday in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. The redshirt freshman quarterback completed 20 of 25 passes for 115 yards but could not keep the Gators from suffering their seventh consecutive loss to ﬁ  nish the season.

Florida never stood a chance.
The results were in before the points were tallied, like 
news stations calling an election with only 10 percent of precincts reporting.
The Gators lost before they took the ﬁ  eld.Whether it was the ﬂ  ood of Florida State fans, clad in 
garnet and gold, sitting in the student section — beneﬁ  -ciaries of a fan base that deemed this season dead weeks ago — or the rumors surrounding a program in a tailspin, Florida marched onto the ﬁ  eld dead men walking.
Sure, the Gators fought valiantly.The defense ﬂ  ew around the ﬁ  eld early, making plays 
like the game mattered, as if Florida could reclaim its place as a top program if it forced enough turnovers and tackled Jameis Winston hard enough.
But the game played out like the rest of the season. The 
Gators brieﬂ  y kept the game close before the Seminoles overpowered them, locking up their 37-7 victory by the end of the ﬁ  rst half and sending UF spiraling to its seventh straight loss.
“Capitalizing on things has been kind of our struggle 
the whole year,” offensive lineman Max Garcia said. “It’s just kind of like we need to do something different. We need to make a play. We need to make a change.”
And the changes came quickly. Fewer than 24 hours after Florida (4-8, 3-5 Southeastern 
Conference) vacated The Swamp for the last time in 2013, the school announced that offensive coordinator Brent Pease and offensive line coach Tim Davis had been ﬁ  red.
If Saturday’s game against Florida State (12-0, 8-0 At-
lantic Coast Conference) was the last chance for Pease and Davis to save their jobs, they put up a poor self-defense.
The Gators’ offense was as anemic as it has been all 
season. Based around power running, the offense totaled a meager 78 yards on 24 rushes. Fifty of those yards came on a Trey Burton run in the ﬁ  rst quarter, but following the OVER AND OUT

The UF-FSU game brought about more 
arrests and ejections than any other home 
game so far this season. It also brought some brawls, including a post-game ﬁ  ght involving an FSU fan and his machete.
According to University Police, 162 
people were arrested or ejected from the game — 73 more than Arkansas, which logged the second-most arrests. Most of the ejections were for intoxication and use of a false ID. The arrest charges ranged from resisting ofﬁ  cers to mari-
juana possession.
Later in the evening, 
Gainesville Police arrested an FSU fan after police re-ported he started a ﬁ  ght at a local bar and eventually charged at the manager with a machete.

Someone just couldn’t get 
over his hatred for pigs, and he took action. Herbert Dick-ey, a Hawthorne man, found his 150-pound hog stabbed nearly to death in his pen one evening. He said he heard a ruckus coming from his hog pen. Some dogs were gath-ered around the pig, so Dickey thought the dogs had attacked him at ﬁ  rst. It wasn’t until he saw the 15 stab wounds he knew someone had broken in and attacked his pig. The per-petrator would be charged $5,000 if caught. 
Dec. 2, 1986The university was de-
throned from the partying list by the king of deﬂ  owering. After two years of making the top 10 of Playboy’s Top 40 Party Colleges, UF dropped to 29 when the ranking system changed. When the magazine looked at “sexual climate” and “quality of student life,” the university came in sixth and ﬁ  rst, respectively. How-ever, with the ranking based on strictly partying that year, UF lost to smaller schools that earned their rankings with as much creativity as crudeness.
Dec. 5, 2003The campus Criminal In-
vestigations Division asked students and faculty to keep an eye on its snacks. A series of vending machines break-ins led University Police to remind everyone to remain vigilant around their confec-tion machines. Six vending machines were broken into over a nine-day period. The robbers’ priorities were not on the sugary and salty mor-sel, as the doors on the ma-chines were pried open and the money stolen.

Regional fungi and bacteria may be part 
of what makes wines unique, researchers re-
cently reported, but some Gainesville wine connoisseurs say the information could de-tract from the drink’s romanticism.
A glass of wine from one region tastes 
different than a glass from another. Of-ten, the differences in taste are credited to the “terroir,” how the climate affects the grapes’ growth. A team from the Univer-sity of California found that wine-growing regions have patterns of fungi and bacteria that may be responsible for distinctive ter-roir taste. Researchers have established a way to prove that terroir exists and might 
have created a way to actually measure it. 
But Randall Gersdorf, a food manager 
at Dorn’s Liquors & Wine Warehouse, said several factors impact wine beyond the sci-
ence of microbes, and these ﬁ  ndings may not be signiﬁ  cant.
“There’s still a very strong sense of place 
when it comes to wine,” he said. “It’s some-thing that would be preserved regardless of these new methods.”
However, it could hurt the wine industry 
if someone could possibly recreate some of the microbial content to simulate a region’s ﬂ  avor. But Gersdorf said he doesn’t think it would be possible to perfectly replicate a wine from a different growing region.
Although most people don’t consider microbes when they think about wine, those found on grapes affect its rate of fermentation, which will also change the ﬂ  avor of grapes, said Bob Dillon, general manager of Half Cork’d wine bar.
Dillon, who has 20 years of experience 
in the industry, said although he thinks fungus and microbes help deﬁ  ne regional tastes, it’s something that may be too com-plicated for the everyday wine drinker. 
“I think it takes away the romance of 
wine if you start talking about microbes and such instead of the mysticism of ter-roir,” Dillon said.

� MOST WOULD CLOSE AT 
MIDNIGHT.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA — The city of Tampa 
is considering big changes in how 
drinks are poured at bars, restau-rants and nightclubs.
A draft ordinance up for consid-
eration by the city council would roll back bar closing times from 3 a.m. to midnight, The Tampa Bay Times reported. Bars, nightclubs and other venues would be able to apply for an “extended hours” business permit to stay open lat-er.
Businesses like convenience 
stores that sell alcohol for carry-out would not be subject to the early closure. Bars, restaurants and nightclubs with special use permits, a form of wet-zoning in which the city council sets operat-ing hours, would also be exempt.
The city is also considering 
issuing new business permits clubs with state licenses to serve drinks.
The proposed rules will be dis-
cussed at a city council meeting on Thursday. They come two years after shootings at two Ybor City-area clubs left one man dead and six wounded.
According to the ordinance, 
an extended-hours permit would be “a privilege, not a right,” and would have to be renewed every year.
The city could suspend or re-
voke a permit if the establishment lets customers drink or stays open after 3 p.m.; had any two violations of certain laws like possession of felony controlled substances with-in a 12-month period; or had four cases of criminal possession of marijuana within six months.
Stephen Michelini, a land-use 
consultant who represents many restaurants in the city, said there are many unanswered questions about a change that could “wreak havoc” on established restau-rants.
“It seems to be an issue where 
there are some problems with very speciﬁ  c locations, but I don’t think the remedy for correcting them is to change the entire ordinance,” he said. “There are other means to get people’s attention.” Tampa considers new 
closing time for bars“There’s still a very strong sense

Henderson’s heart has been 
hooked up to a washing machine-
sized power supply dubbed “Big Blue.” Big Blue restricts her move-ments, making her completely bound to the hospital.
Bleiweis said giving patients 
the portable battery is a European practice, but the medical team hopes to bring the same careful protocols to the U.S., so Henderson can leave  the hospital.
“Like any other person wait-
ing for her transplant, she’s been a little impatient,” he said. “But she’s been amazingly tolerant of being in the hospital and everything that goes on in an ICU.”
Henderson said she first 
thought the symptoms of her heart troubles were caused by a stomach virus, but after days with no relief, her mom said, “We need to go to Gainesville.” 
They left around 4 a.m., and af-
ter being held at Shands, the doc-tors broke the news — severe car-diac allograft vasculopathy, which is damage to the coronary arteries associated with heart transplants.
Henderson had her first heart 
transplant in 2007 after her heart became enlarged and weakened, but in May 2013, she began experi-encing heart failure again.
Bleiweis said after stabilizing 
Henderson with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a method of providing blood to the body when the heart needs assistance, there was need for a long-term op-tion.
He said there are documented 
cases where patients have had the synthetic heart for more than a year, and with careful monitoring, there is potential to function with the heart for a long period of time.
After replacing Henderson’s 
heart with a SynCardia in June, her previously failing organs recov-ered completely.
Now, she is in perfect condition 
to receive a new heart.
“I’m just waiting for a heart any 
moment now,” Henderson said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2013

With finals approaching, stu-
dents looking for quiet at “Club 
West” might not be on the list.
But agitated students could be 
misinformed about library rules.
The only quiet floor in Library 
West is the fourth floor, said Mi-chele LeSure, nights and weekends circulation coordinator in Library West.
“People may not be on the right 
floor for their needs,” LeSure said.
She added that library employ-
ees will ask students to be quiet only on the fourth floor. The first, second and third floors permit talk-ing because some students work or study in groups.“Things have come a long way 
from the shushing librarian,” she said.
Still, students are complaining 
about the noise level.
“Just the other day while I was in 
the study carrels, there was a group of girls talking and laughing,” said Monica Tromer, a 19-year-old UF chemistry freshman. “That was kind of annoying.”
But Kriti Vedhanayagam, a 21-
year-old UF English junior, said students who only show up to the library during finals week have taken over.
“I find it offensive when people 
tell me not to discuss a problem with a friend on a talking floor,” she said. “The second and third floor are still talking floors.”Noise among complaints at Library West

A local artist will have the 
chance to share the spotlight with a 
contestant from “The Voice.”
Melanie Martinez, who was on 
season three of “The Voice,” will be performing at High Dive on Dec. 13, and local talent Kelsi Candelar-ia was picked to open the event. 
The show starts at 8 p.m. Tickets 
will be $12 in advance and $14 at the door.Candelaria, 20, a local musician 
with an associate degree in musi-cal theater, said she used to watch “The Voice,” and Martinez was her favorite contestant. 
Candelaria said she will prob-
ably perform her song “Valentine,” which went viral on YouTube with about 52,000 views. 
Candelaria has performed more 
than 70 shows since she was 16 and said she incorporates new music at every performance.
“Being on stage, I feel like I get to be the truest version of myself. It’s like a safe place,” she said.
The booking agent picked Can-
delaria to perform with Martinez because of their similar music and fashion tastes.
It is hard to build a fan base in 
a college town because people con-stantly move in and out of the city, Candelaria said, but this also helps spread music.
With so much talent going un-
noticed, Candelaria said she wants to enrich Gainesville’s culture and bring more attention to the music scene.
“You have a lot of talented people 
coming in and out of Gainesville,” she said. “There’s this thing grow-ing under the surface. And it disap-points me that more people don’t know about it. I want Gainesville to be known for music.”
Megan Hill, 21-year-old Santa 
Fe College student, wrote in an email it is important that artists be appreciated.
Hill said she is a fan of both 
Candelaria and Martinez’s music and expects to leave the show with goosebumps. 
“I’ve watched Melanie Marti-
nez’s videos on YouTube before she was ever on ‘The Voice,’ and I absolutely love Kelsi Candelaria,” Hill said.

FSU fan charged at people with a machete
sisting an officer and drug possession, ac-
cording to an arrest report.
Brown intervened in an argument be-
tween a man and woman at EndZone Bar,  1209 W. University Ave., said GPD spokes-man Officer Ben Tobias. In an effort to pro-tect the woman, Brown challenged the man to a fight, and several Gators bargoers tried to stop him. 
Brown was intoxicated when he invited 
them into the parking lot to continue fight-ing, Tobias said. No one followed him ex-cept the bar manager, who called police. 
Brown went to his truck and brought out 
a machete, which he used to charge at the manager first and then at the woman from inside the bar, according to the report.
He drove from the restaurant down 
the alley behind EndZone with his license plate covered by a T-shirt, according to the report. 
Brown stopped and got out of his car 
behind Mother’s Pub and Grill with the machete. 
An off-duty officer from Pembroke Pines 
was nearby wearing an FSU shirt and was able to subdue Brown, Tobias said.
A GPD officer then arrested Brown and 
found marijuana in his car’s center con-sole, according to the report. When the of-ficer tried to lead Brown into the patrol car, Brown stood straight and refused to get in, saying the officer would have to shoot him dead. 
The officer ended up kneeing Brown to 
get him into the vehicle.
Officers booked Brown into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 10:30 p.m. Saturday. He was later released at about 4 p.m. Sun-day after meeting a $25,000 bond.GAMed Ay, from page 1 toledo: intoxicated persons: 1, 3 total

Businesses across Gainesville 
beneﬁ  ted from Small Business Sat-
urday, which encouraged custom-ers to support independent, locally owned businesses. The day-after-Black-Friday event was promoted on social media and has gained traction in the past few years.
“I think we did pretty good,” 
said 66-year-old Anda Chance about Saturday sales at the Arti-sans’ Guild Gallery.
Chance, an employee at the 
downtown gallery, said she sup-ports shopping locally because she prefers to keep money in town. 
Artisans’ Guild Gallery, located 
at 201 SE Second Place, is an inde-pendent business that has reaped success from local supporters. Chance said the cooperative has been around for about 40 years, although the gallery has only been in its current location for about two years. The gallery sells one-of-a-kind arts and crafts made from clay, ﬁ  ber, glass, wood and other media. 
“We can’t do what (bigger busi-
nesses) do,” Chance said. “But we don’t try to compete with that.”
The gallery is located near the 
Union Street Station shopping area, which is home to other lo-cal businesses such as Hear Again Music and Movies, Persona Vin-tage Clothing & Costumes and Sarkara Sweets.
A ﬂ  ier from the Shop Small 
campaign was posted on the door of Sarkara Sweets. It read, “Shop small with us for delectable vegan cupcakes.”
American Express contributed 
to the nationwide movement by mapping out a directory of lo-cal businesses participating in the campaign. The credit card com-pany offered beneﬁ  ts to cardhold-ers who made purchases of $10 or more at qualifying locations Satur-day. 
Though the campaign encour-
ages shopping small, the fees in-volved with processing American Express card transactions have caused some local businesses to pass on the major corporation.
“We don’t use American Ex-
press for that reason,” Chance said. 
Buying local helps the city 
by creating jobs and improving the economy, according to the Gainesville Area Chamber of Com-merce website. Sales tax from local purchases are reinvested in the community, contributing to city-provided services and allowing the “mom and pop” shops to sup-port community organizations.
Erick Edwing, a 19-year-old UF 
public relations sophomore, said he would buy some of his holiday gifts locally this year.
“Small businesses usually have 
the coolest things,” he said. “Shop-ping there is different from Black Friday, where people will ﬁ  ght over a discounted toaster.”

after ofﬁ  cers reported he threat-ened a man with a baseball bat and a toy gun.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 48-year-old 
Bobby Lee Bean on aggravated assault charges, according to a GPD arrest report.
At 12:35 p.m., Bean threat-
ened Johnell Wayne Gordon with an aluminum baseball bat in the 1400 block of East Uni-versity Avenue. Bean then left the area and returned about 20 minutes later. He threatened Gordon again, pulling what Gordon believed was a hand-gun out of his waistband, ac-cording to the report.G o r d o n 
went into a house and called police. 
When po-
lice arrived, they found the car Bean was report-edly driving, 
along with the gun and bat. 
Ofﬁ  cers discovered a toy 
gun had been painted black to look like a real handgun, ac-cording to the report. Bean de-nied pulling the gun and told police he’d gotten into a ﬁ  ght with Gordon the day before. He said the toy gun was a gift for his nephew.
Bean was booked into jail 
at about 1 p.m., where he re-mained with a $30,000 bond.Man threatens another

shopping on Black Friday?Today’s question: Are you ready for the semester to be 
over?Gator fans joking 
about rape should 
be ashamed
Often when we bemoan UF fan behavior, we refer to be-
nign actions such as students leaving before the game is over or stupidly passing out due to excessive alcohol 
consumption. 
However, fan behavior that occurred Saturday during the 
UF-FSU game at The Swamp was far more sinister. 
Photos are being shared online of UF students wearing T-
shirts emblazoned with “The Rapers: Forced Sex University” in response to Jameis Winston’s alleged rape of an FSU student last December. Although we normally hesitate to source Total-FratMove.com, sources told the website’s moderator that men of UF’s Phi Gamma Delta chapter were behind this particular T-shirt design.
However, the fraternity wasn’t alone in its disgusting display 
of ignorance. Cheers rang out over the stadium on Saturday, mocking FSU, the Winston case and rape and sexual assault in general. 
UF fans gleefully clung to the negative attention FSU has been 
receiving with tasteless jokes and crude T-shirts, thus cementing the image in Americans’ brains of UF as a party school full of drunken idiots who lack sensitivity about campus rape — a na-tional problem that affects about one in ﬁ  ve college women.
The Alligator’s editorial board would like to apologize to the 
victim and her family on behalf of the UF fans who apparently have no regard for the real people involved in the Winston case and the 20 percent of college women affected by sexual assault and rape. 
Low morale isn’t a reason to bring an issue much more seri-
ous than football itself into the stadium. 
What is perhaps more disturbing is how the fan behavior 
went beyond the “rape-jokes-aren’t-funny” argument. 
In this case, a stadium full of students shamed another uni-
versity because one individual came forward and reported rape to the police. This sends a damaging message to women that victim-blaming is inevitable and could discourage them from coming forward with their stories of rape and sexual assault —  crimes that are grossly underreported in the ﬁ  rst place. 
To the students who participated and were complicit in this 
behavior, you should take a close look at yourselves. It’s very likely some of the women around you in the stadium were vic-tims of rape and sexual assault, yet you decided to make it a joke under the weak guise of football rivalry. 
UF prides itself on being a progressive institution that makes 
enormous strides in academia and research, but these malicious actions hurt the brand UF has worked to establish and diminish-es the value of a UF degree. It further adds to a victim-blaming culture in response to reports of rape, and it sends a message to women that silence is better than tarnishing a university’s im-age. 
For a university that’s supposed to be a hotbed for forward 
thinking, the actions of UF fans on Saturday represented one giant step backward. 
Goodbye to all that: On entering adulthood
With Thanksgiving Break coming to an end, it’s 
time to come back to school for the last two weeks of the semester. 
Hopefully, we’re full, happy and ready to take on 
exams and ﬁ  nal projects before the end of 2013.
Then we’ll have a couple of weeks to regroup, en-
joy some holiday festivities and start working on those New Year’s resolutions for the next semester. 
But for some of us, this might be that last hurrah. 
As I say goodbye to the structure — albeit chaotic — university life offers, I’m looking forward to the next chapter and whatever it has in store for me.
Graduation means more than putting on a cap and 
gown and walking across a stage. That piece of paper, which I will proudly frame and set up in an ofﬁ  ce some-where someday, is a testament to more than grades, classes or even a college degree. 
Professional competition is ﬁ  erce right now. Once 
upon a time, getting a bachelor’s degree was enough to guarantee a good job. Now, going to graduate school is almost a given. Being hyperqualiﬁ  ed is the norm.
Let’s not dismiss the weight of the four years we’ve 
spent here. 
There are a few experiences that most of us can re-
late to: the unproductive all-nighters at Library West, happily subsisting on peanut butter and jelly sandwich-es freshman year in the dorms and Krishna Lunch on the Plaza of the Americas on beautiful Florida autumn days.
But the truth is, we’ve all had unique experiences at 
UF. 
Reﬂ  ecting on that has made me nostalgic and, all the 
same, excited to move on. 
Learning never stops. We are constantly studying the 
people and situations around us. We take notes on what we want, what we don’t, who we want to be and who we shouldn’t be. Life is a series of exams, except cram-ming is not an option. The test comes when you least expect it, and if you’re not prepared, you have no choice but to ﬁ  ght through it.
Personal growth isn’t cer-
emonious. There’s no stage to walk across every time we pass a hurdle at work, no diploma 
for “a bachelor of science in personal relationships” waiting for us when we go through a breakup. There’s certainly no dean smiling, shaking our hand when we get over our quarter-life crisis.  
We’ve been conditioned in school that, when the test 
is turned in, we can make room for new information, that everything comes to an end nicely — that we can start fresh every semester. But life doesn’t offer dead-lines or ﬁ  nal grades. There’s no real closure. So when some of us graduate in a couple of weeks, let’s cherish that it might be one of the last times we get to close something with fanfare. 
As I look back at these four-or-so years that I’ve been 
a student here, I feel grateful. I took creative liberties by taking a year off for some traveling and work, which is why I feel my upcoming graduation is my second time going out into the real world, without an institution to go back to.
While I’m ofﬁ  cially closing this chapter, it’s impor-
tant to note I’m opening another. A diploma shows what I’ve accomplished in my academic life so far, but more than that, it’s a passport to the rest of my life — our lives. We’ll cross into territories that still remain unex-plored, and those are some of the best lessons we’ll get. 
And no, there’s no Smokin’ Notes or TutoringZone 
for that, but really, that’s OK with me.

Rhinos are majestic but 
well-armored beasts with thick skin and enormous 
protruding horns on their noses. Many people just see rhinos as large ferocious animals that roam the African plains and are considered among the most deadly animals in Africa. 
So, why would anyone mess with a rhino 
— and what for? Well, in many Asian and Chinese cultures, it’s believed the horn of a rhino can cure many diseases, one of which is cancer. Due to these needs, many rhinos are being poached just for their horns. With rhino horns going for as much as $100,000 per about two pounds of horn, according to Sports Aﬁ  eld, it is said to be more valuable than gold, diamonds and illegal substances such as cocaine. 
Poachers know this, and they continue to 
slaughter rhinos in pursuit of the extravagant amount of money available. A recent study found that poaching has more than doubled in recent years, and if this continues, rhinos could be extinct in the wild in about 20 years. 
There have been many attempts to try to 
reduce the poaching of rhinos. In 1977, the Convention on International Trade in En-dangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora banned the trade of rhino horns. 
Due to economic growth in 
many Chinese cultures, the de-mand for rhino horns has increased dramatically in the past ﬁ  ve years. 
Many countries in Africa have increased se-curity within their parks by hiring more rang-ers. A few years ago, some countries tried to help rhinos by cutting the animals’ horns off so poachers wouldn’t kill them. 
This was unsuccessful for two reasons: 
One was that rhinos’ horns grow back, and the poachers would still kill them for just a little bit of the horn. Second was that after a poacher tracks a rhino for a day and sees one without the horn, the poacher will kill it for the simple fact that next time they poach, they won’t be tracking a hornless rhino. 
There are still many ideas about how to 
stop poaching but not all are acceptable. The most effective way, as of today, is to increase security within rhino grazing areas, but with increased security comes the demand for more money. You can help save rhinos by donating a little money to rhino conservation programs. You’ll possibly save the rhino pop-ulation for more generations to see.

Rhino endangerment is a problemGuest column
Kanye West’s latest 
music video for his track “Bound 
2” is poorly composed and ridiculous, featuring a montage of overdone, tacky nature CGI scenes and Kanye on a motor-cycle. The video ﬂ  ashes randomly between these Midwestern scenes and close-ups of Kanye’s and Kim Kardashian’s awful sex faces. It’s no surprise the video release of “Bound 2” about a week ago has already generated some seriously wonderful spoofs.
The best one going viral right now 
was composed by none other than the lovable duo of James Franco and Seth Rogen, who met on the set of the 1999 television show “Freaks and Geeks” and whose friendship rose to fame through the cult stoner ﬁ  lm “Pineapple Express” ﬁ  ve years ago.
Franco and Rogen’s remake of 
“Bound 2” is also known as “Bound 3” due to its incredibly accurate par-ody of the grotesque, choppy motor-cycle sex scene between Kanye and Kim, which spans nearly the entire four-minute video. Franco and Ro-gen’s rendition reaches next-level hilarity as they mimic each frame, reveling in the absurdity of it all.
Franco satirizes Kanye’s peacock-
ing gestures while rapping, drawing attention to the ways men in hip-hop culture garishly exaggerate their masculinity. His portrayal of Kanye is ironic but accurate, embodying the egocentricity of the famous rapper while also reminding us of Franco’s satirical performance as the rap-per “Alien” in “Spring Breakers.” In “Bound 3,” Franco’s basically the “shee-it.”
Rogen, on the other hand, takes on the role of the naked Kim Kardashian, riding backwards on the front of the motorcycle and thrusting like she does 
with his arms in the air. He mimics her “sexy” face perfectly, complete with bedroom eyes and half-open lips. The humor behind Rogen’s por-trayal of Kim is obvious — he, like Kim, tries so hard in the video to ap-pear as feminine and voluptuous as possible.
In watching the satire that is 
“Bound 3,” we see Franco and Rogen portray Kanye and Kim as trying way too hard. Both seem detached from each other, competing for attention and camera time in the video. Their relationship seems staged, awkward and forced, as neither Kanye nor Kim is willing to give in to the self-less and self-concealing demands of true love. Relationships are formed to emphasize a unity between two people, resulting in some degree of the loss of the “self” — a concept clearly lost on two individuals so ﬁ  x-ated on their own “selves” that the union of the two narcissists is hard to watch.
“Bound 2” portrays the relation-
ship between Kanye and Kim as one 
that is purely superﬁ  cial, fake and physical, all staged under Holly-wood lights. In a world where sex is so overtly portrayed and normalized through popular media, Franco and Rogen’s remake not only recognizes this but also exposes the fakeness of such behavior. “Bound 3” is deﬁ  nite-ly worth a watch — if you can handle the obnoxious background music.

Let’s say you brought 
your favorite pet to col-lege. Three exams and 
two papers later, you’re real-izing you don’t have the time or space to care for Steve the Snake. Well, doesn’t every animal want to be free? Let-ting him go into the wild is the best option, right?
Wrong! Releasing your pet is bad for 
both your pet and lots of native plants and animals. A pet is used to everyday care and constant shelter. Imagine all of that disap-pearing without having the proper skills to ﬁ  nd food or a home. Many pets, then, would not be able to survive in the wild.
Now, imagine your pet is somehow able to survive. It is now competing with native species and killing plants and animals that have no defense against this exotic pet. If it is able to reproduce, then it can 
take a serious toll on the ecosystem. 
There are better options than release. 
Local animal shelters and rescues are good ideas for cats and dogs. For exotic pets, ﬁ  nd out when the Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-servation Commission is holding its next Exotic Pet Amnesty Day. 
If you are no longer able to keep your pet, 
think twice about releasing it into the wild. Your pet and the ecosystem depend on it.
Katie Price is a UF wildlife and ecology 
senior. Releasing pets detrimental Guest columnDespite the three years that remain in his term, for all intents and purposes, it appears that Barack Obama’s time as 
president is over. Some may feel sadness and disappointment, others pure jubilation. Re-gardless of how you feel about the president and his policies, the notion that someone’s presidency could effectively end three years before it should is damaging to the American government and our country. 
More than the Republicans who pledged 
to obstruct Obama at every turn or the Ameri-can people who are rightfully upset with the White House over the rollout of Obamacare, it’s the pundits, pollsters and news outlets that are prematurely ending a presidency. 
Rather than discussing issues, policies or 
today’s politics, many focus on the politics and elections of the future. Recent elections in Virginia and New Jersey were viewed as bellwethers for the 2016 election — ignor-ing the 2014 midterms completely. Exit polls asked voters in those states about hypotheti-cal matchups between Democrat Hillary Clin-ton and Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Naturally, the pundits dis-
sected the results ad nauseam be-cause the American democracy is all about elections. 
The political class’s obsession 
with elections is harmful to the fabric of an already fragile sys-tem of government. Near paraly-sis in Congress — combined with mounting issues ranging from climate change to immigration to improve-ments to the Affordable Care Act — is putting the American people at serious risk. 
No matter how big or small you believe the 
federal government should be, we must have a functioning government to preserve and protect the U.S. for future generations. Sadly, the perpetual election cycle prevents us from moving forward on major issues. 
We can all agree the rollout of the Afford-
able Care Act’s online exchange and some provisions within the law need serious im-provements. With a functioning government, Congress could pursue a technical corrections bill to ﬁ  x the problems within the law. 
Instead, Republicans have tied their politi-cal future to a complete repeal of the law, claiming an idea cham-pioned by Republicans in the 1990s is nothing more than dirty, rotten socialism. Why the lack of compromise or a functioning government? 
Elections. The politicians see the polls, 
read the news and even occa-
sionally listen to one of the blathering talking heads on television. It’s more about protecting their jobs than creating them for the millions of Americans still struggling to ﬁ  nd work in the aftermath of the Great Recession. 
Christie summed it up best in the days 
following his re-election. Despite being an oft-discussed 2016 presidential candidate, he chastised people who are already looking at the next election, rather than the job at hand: running the country. 
Politics are everywhere. But that doesn’t 
mean we should simply ignore the job of pol-icy making and governing, just because elec-tions seem like more fun. 
Elections — especially presidential elec-tions — are the Super Bowl of politics, and it’s the main reason why the pundits and politi-cal junkies are always talking about them. Just like football, you can’t simply skip from the ﬁ  rst week of the season to the championship game. A lot can happen, and a lot can change.  
The Gators were undefeated after the ﬁ  rst 
week of the season and look how that worked out for them. The lesson is: Don’t start think-ing about the big game until you actually get there.
In government, it takes hard work, com-
promise, a willingness to get the job done —  regardless of politics — and an understanding that the voters have the right to ﬁ  re you come the next election cycle. We have three years until we elect the next president, and it would be a shame if we only play the game of politics between now and then. The American people have too much at stake. So I ask the political junkies, for the good of the country, to put the politics to rest, roll up your sleeves and actu-ally work together to better our country.

The community pool at the Continuum is empty Sunday evening. The student complex, considered UF-
afﬁ  liated housing, recently faced resident complaints about verbal agreements and lease cancellations. 
KELCEE GRIFFIS
Alligator Staff Writer kgrifﬁ  s@alligator.org
Gustavo Martinez remembers 
the meeting about his lease at the 
Continuum clearly.
When the UF law student found 
out he’d scored a Summer 2013 internship with a Pompano Beach ﬁ  rm, he asked a staff member to honor a verbal deal they made al-lowing him to break his lease two months early for academic reasons.
“There was an awkward si-
lence,” Martinez said. “She said, ‘Yeah, we can’t do that.’”
The Continuum, considered UF-
afﬁ  liated housing, is touted as a premier housing option for gradu-ate students, including those in law and master’s in business adminis-tration programs.
In a formal complaint ﬁ  led with 
the attorney general’s ofﬁ  ce by a former resident, renters said staff at the complex verbally promised they could break their contracts early if they received internships. But as summer neared and intern-ship-bound tenants like Martinez went to take the complex up on the offer, they were threatened with or hit with various penalties.
“Everybody was essentially told 
a different story,” Martinez said, adding that staff members said the request couldn’t be honored be-cause the promises were made un-der the old management.
Now, six months after the wave 
of leasing complaints, the Continu-um seems to have updated its leas-ing policy to prevent similar situa-tions in the future. Administrators have been quiet about what the changes actually mean.
Alton Irwin, the spokesman for 
the Continuum’s Birmingham, Ala.-based management company, Cap-stone on Campus, wrote in an email that, in June, the management com-pany “implemented a more ﬂ  ex-ible cancellation and termination policy, to address student residents participating in internships and Co-Op Assignments, as well as those leaving school for other reasons.”
He would not point out or com-
ment on speciﬁ  c changes, but he re-ferred back to the online policies.
The leasing policy posted on the 
Continuum’s website incorporates a caveat that allows for lease termi-nation or cancellation due to “legiti-mate academic reasons.”
According to the policy, those reasons are deﬁ  ned as, “No longer afﬁ  liated with the University (doc-umentary evidence is required),” “graduation,” “ineligibility to con-tinue enrollment due to failure to meet academic requirements” and “registered co-op, internship, or residency outside of the area (more than 30 miles away from the Uni-versity of Florida’s main campus).”
However, the policy does spell 
out a $1,000 termination fee if stu-dents choose to end a lease early   even for “legitimate academic rea-sons.”
This Summer, the contradiction between the printed leases and the verbal agreements sparked conten-tion among residents, but UF would not get involved with the Universi-ty Avenue complex that sports the UF Housing and Residence Educa-tion logo on its website.
University spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes declined to comment about the leases in question, but she said the university was aware of one incident that occurred during the summer.
As for UF’s relationship to the 
Continuum, she said the university just “helps identify potential leas-ers.”
Sharon Blansett, assistant to the 
associate vice president for student affairs, distanced the university from the complex.
“The Continuum staff are re-
sponsible for all day-to-day opera-tions, including leases,” she said. “Students who live at the Continu-um are not signing a lease with the University of Florida.”
To address collective concerns, 
in May Martinez organized an email response he sent to Continu-um management and UF Housing executives. The email was signed by 10 students. 
He wrote that the lease ﬂ  exibility 
in the event of an internship was a “strong selling point that was used and emphasized” by the complex.
“We were told that if we re-
ceived an internship or externship we had to present a letter to the Continuum, signed by the univer-sity, explaining that we would be away for the summer doing an in-ternship,” he wrote in the email.
At ﬁ  rst, Martinez heard nothing 
back. So he sent a follow-up email to the Student Affairs ofﬁ  ce, em-phasizing that students and parents were concerned. Within two hours, he said, he got an email from the Continuum saying he was released from his rent so he could go to the internship.
“It had to almost be coerced 
out of them,” said Martinez, who returned to Gainesville after the in-ternship ended in July and moved into another apartment complex. 
Meanwhile, Brad Willard, an at-
torney and former Continuum resi-dent who ﬁ  led the complaint, said it struggled to gain traction. He said the complaint didn’t get much further than the attorney general’s Consumer Protection Division. The scope of the problem wasn’t wide enough, and patterns of behavior must be larger than one apartment complex. 
“It’s completely done, at least as 
far as they’re telling me,” Willard said.

Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
Brent Pease will take the fall 
for Florida’s ﬁ  rst losing season 
since 1979. 
Will Muschamp ﬁ  red his offen-
sive coordinator of two seasons on Sunday morning, the Associated Press ﬁ  rst reported. 
Offensive line coach Tim Davis 
was also ﬁ  red Sunday, as ﬁ  rst re-ported by CBS Sports.
“I have a lot of respect for 
coach Pease and coach Davis,” Muschamp said in a UF release. 
“They are both good football 
coaches and even better people. There have been a lot of unfortu-nate circumstances this year, but that is part of the game some-times.”
Pease, who was also quoted 
in the release, said: “I am grateful for the opportunity to come to the University of Florida and work with a bunch of great coaches, administrative staff and players. I know we came up short of our ultimate goal, but I will carry on knowing I gained valuable friend-ships and relationships during my time here.”
The ﬁ  rings come on the heels 
of Florida’s 37-7 loss to No. 2 Flor-ida State on Saturday. Muschamp hinted during his postgame press conference that changes were im-minent.
“We need to take a look at our-
selves schematically with what we’re doing,” Muschamp said. “There have been some things that have happened that are very difﬁ  cult to overcome, but sche-matically, there’s no question we need to take a look at ourselves.”

also addressed the offense when meeting with reporters to reiterate his support of Muschamp prior to Saturday’s game.“We’ve got to ﬁ  x that side of 
the ball,” Foley said. “I’m not be-ing disrespectful to anybody, but you look at some of the games we’ve lost, we haven’t scored many points. This year or last year or what have you, that has to get ﬁ  xed. And that’s going to be Will’s responsibility as the head football coach.”
Pease, who was under contract through the 2015 season, said on Nov. 26 that he felt he earned the right to return to the Gators in 2014. When asked if he thought he would return, he replied, “I hope so.”
“You look at the ﬁ  rst year and 
some of the situations and know-ing the body of work and not just one, a game-to-game basis and situations we’ve been under. I hope any evaluations are looked at that way,” Pease said Nov. 26. “But, you know, I understand things, too. ... I know you’ve got to win and have success. If it’s not meant to be ... I came into this with friends, and I’m walking out of it with friends.”
In two seasons under Pease’s 
direction, UF struggled to do much of anything offensively. Florida ranks 114th in total of-fense this season with 316.7 yards per game — a downgrade from last season’s unit, which ranked 104th.
Numerous injuries to key of-
fensive contributors, including quarterback Jeff Driskel, running back Matt Jones and three starting offensive linemen, helped sink Pease in the Gators’ lowest-scor-ing season (226 points) since 1986.
The Gators hired Pease in 2012, 
beating out Nick Saban and Ala-bama for the services of the six-year Boise State assistant coach. 
Pease coached Broncos wide 
receivers for ﬁ  ve seasons before serving as the offensive coordi-nator for coach Chris Petersen in 2011. 
“A little bit more imagination 
with formations, shifts, motion to create issues for the defense,” Muschamp said in August 2012 of what Pease offered the Gators. “We are getting ready for some-thing we don’t see a lot in our league.”

Pease Out: Coordinator ﬁ  red after two seasons

During a weekend of ﬁ  rings, Loucheiz Purifoy is leaving 
Gainesville voluntarily.
The junior cornerback told ESPN he would forego his se-
nior season to enter the 2014 NFL Draft. Draft experts are high 
on Purifoy despite an up-and-down career at Florida.
ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. lists Purifoy as the No. 26 pros-
pect in this year’s draft. Fellow ESPN analyst Todd McShay pegs Purifoy as the ﬁ  fth-best cornerback prospect.Despite the distractions that come with 
a prospective NFL future, Florida defensive 
coordinator D.J. Durkin believes Purifoy has successfully dealt with those challenges.
“There’s always teachable moments and 
things to learn from,” Durkin said. “He’s had a lot of teachable moments this year. As of late, most recently, he’s handling it well.”
Purifoy ends his career at Florida with 
plenty of proliﬁ  c highlights.Perhaps his most famous play was a blocked punt that led 
to the game-winning touchdown in Florida’s 27-20 win against Louisiana last November. The ball deﬂ  ected off Purifoy’s hands and ﬂ  uttered into the outstretched arms of former UF linebacker Jelani Jenkins, who ran in the winning score.
The Pensacola native also made the highlight reel with 
game-changing hits on defense and special teams. He ﬁ  nishes his Florida career as only the 13th Gator to record ﬁ  ve or more forced fumbles in his career.Purifoy leaving Florida after proliﬁ  c, inconsistent careerGod must hate Florida foot-
ball. 
Or whoever controls 
the fate of the players that toil on the gridiron every Saturday is not much a fan of coach Will Mus-champ. 
With No. 2 
Florida State heading to Gainesville, o f f e n s i v e coordinator Brent Pease had some-thing up his 
sleeve for what ultimately became his Last Stand.
Pease expected to feature slot 
receiver Trey Burton 35 snaps at quarterback. The senior was half of Florida’s offensive game plan. 
But on the fourth play of Flor-
ida’s second drive Saturday, a left shoulder injury had Burton watch-ing the game like so many others have for the Gators this season — from the sidelines.
Granted, an offensive game 
plan featuring the Gators’ best re-ceiver playing quarterback against the Seminoles didn’t seem feasible no matter how many misdirec-tions were run, but it was the game plan and it was thrown out before Johnny Townsend attempted the second of six punts.

Casey Prather has been Florida’s most productive player 
through seven games.
The senior leads the Gators this season with 19.1 points 
per game — more than triple his average of 6.2 from a year 
ago — on 64 percent shooting. His rebounds (5.7) and assists (2.4) per game have increased signiﬁ  cantly since last season.
Prather ﬁ  lled the stat sheet during Florida’s 67-66 win 
against Florida State on Friday night in the O’Connell Cen-ter, recording a team-high 19 points on 6-of-10 shooting, four rebounds, an assist and no turnovers in 26 minutes.
What has caused Prather’s rapid improvement?“Just being more aggressive, I guess,” Prather said.Attacking the rim with more aggression has worked in 
the favor of the 6-foot-6, 212-pound Prather, especially with the NCAA’s new hand-check rule translating to more visits to the foul line for teams. 
Prather leads the team in free-throw attempts with 51 and 
has shot 72.5 percent from the charity stripe. Almost all of his ﬁ  eld-goal attempts this year have come inside the arc.
Because he has been one of Florida’s healthiest players 
this year, Prather has utilized his daring style of basketball as a slasher. In previous years, multiple injuries — such as concussions and a high ankle sprain — made the Jackson, Tenn., native wary and hesitant.
Coach Billy Donovan said Prather has played with a 
clearer understanding of the game this season. He sees the forward improving his pacing and patience on the ﬂ  oor.
“He’s a guy that probably the ﬁ  rst couple of years in his 
career was really painful for him,” Donovan said. “He was a deer in the headlights a lot of times. The lights came on and he was very unsure of himself. And I think for him this year, he’s gotten better. He’s playing to his strengths. He’s not forcing shots. He’s not trying to make plays that aren’t there. He’s been a lot more productive and selective. 
“The fact when you’re a player and you know you’re go-
ing to be on the ﬂ  oor, you know you’re going to be out there, sometimes it’s a little bit easier because you know you’re go-ing to be there.”
Also beneﬁ  tting Prather this year is that he has been able to 
play most of his minutes at small forward — his natural spot. Last year, Prather mostly saw time on the ﬂ  oor as a power forward because of Florida’s lack of frontcourt depth.
“It helps a lot,” Prather said of playing small forward. “It 
helps me run the ﬂ  oor a little bit more, instead of taking the ball out because the four-man takes the ball out. It allows me to run up and down the court.”
No. 15 Florida (6-1) hopes Prather will continue his recent 
tear when it squares off against No. 13 Connecticut (7-0) to-night at 7 in Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Conn. 
The Huskies, who utilize a three-guard starting lineup, 
have seen consistent production from junior forward De-Andre Daniels and senior guard Shabazz Napier. The duo has combined for 28.4 points and 12 rebounds per game this season.
“It’s going to be a great challenge for our guys,” Prather 
said. “They’re a good team. Their guards are very quick, ex-plosive, athletic.
“They have matchup problems just as well as we have 
matchup problems. We just have to do a good job converting on each and every offensive and defensive play.”

against Florida State on Friday in the O’Connell Center.

It was a chaotic weekend for the Gators in the Ba-
hamas. 
Florida lost its ﬁ  rst game to a previously winless Il-
linois State team 68-64 on Friday. 
Everything went wrong for the Gators in the ﬁ  rst 
half against the Redbirds. Florida shot 32 percent from 
the ﬁ  eld and was 0-for-7 from three-point range in the ﬁ  rst 20 minutes. The Redbirds shot 46.4 percent and led the Gators 35-24 at halftime.
“Illinois State was clearly 
just a lot more ready to play than the Gators were [Friday], and I have to take responsibil-ity for that,” coach Amanda Butler said. “I’m just really, re-
ally embarrassed by the way we played in the ﬁ  rst half, but then you have to give Illinois State credit for that.”
Florida rallied in the second half, but the Gators 
could not hold on despite a 24-point night from Jaterra Bonds. 
The following day, Florida took on a tougher Oregon 
State team in a consolation game. 
On paper, the Gators were severely outmatched by 
the Beavers, who featured three players 6 feet or taller in their starting lineup. Oregon State’s center, sophomore Ruth Hamblin, is 6-foot-6. 
Those suspicions were conﬁ  rmed in the ﬁ  rst half; 
Florida fell behind 35-31 by halftime. 
But seemingly all of the Gators’ weaknesses turned 
into strengths against the Beavers in the second half. 
Florida avoided signiﬁ  cant foul trouble. Even Ronni 
Williams, who has been plagued by foul trouble this season, was eligible the entire game. 
The Gators also outrebounded the Beavers 45-37 in 
their 73-70 victory.
“To win the rebounding battle is huge,” Butler said. 
“It was exactly what we needed to do and it was exactly how we needed to play. I just loved, loved our tough-ness in this game.”
January Miller led the way for Florida in points for 
the third time in four games, scoring 19 points on 60 percent shooting. Fifteen of her 19 points came in the second half. Gators earn split

UF Women’s 
Bask etballevery week. 
Injuries decimated any shot of Pease 
lasting another year and the Gators per-
forming any better than what they showed in 2013. Broken bones aren’t an excuse, but the various injuries broke Florida’s confidence. At some point, that “woe-is-me” mentality Muschamp railed against infiltrated the team. It’s human nature.
Former offensive coordinator Char-
lie Weis and quarterback Jacoby Brissett stared at the Florida State sidelines fol-lowing its celebration in The Swamp after handling Florida in 2011. Weis told Bris-sett to remember that game and that feel-ing of losing to the school up north. 
The lasting image from Saturday wasn’t 
so much what happened after the game, but instead what didn’t happen during it. Jeff Driskel wasn’t taking snaps, and Dominique Easley wasn’t sacking Jameis Winston. Chaz Green wasn’t blocking for Driskel, and Matt Jones wasn’t carrying the football.
Throw in the fluky scooter accidents to 
Tyler Moore and Joey Ivie, and 2013 just wasn’t the Year of the Gator. As the great Vince Lombardi once said, “What the hell is going on out there?”
That question remained unanswered 
as 15 seniors were honored on Saturday. I, too, had a Senior Day of sorts with Satur-day being the last Gators football game I cover for now. Thinking back, I hold onto Sexy Rexy letting it rip and the trials and tribulations of 2006 — crying after the Au-burn loss and erupting after The Block. I also remember standing in section 407, row 24 and seat 18 watching Tim Tebow win his second national championship.
The Burton injury epitomized a year 
that never made sense. There were ques-tionable play calls, inexplicable defensive collapses and an inherent need to shank field goals every game, as well as the in-jury bug that never went away. 
Florida’s new offensive coordinator 
will be burdened by the fleeting images of yesteryear’s success, while tasked to move the program beyond the images of this forgettable season. 
The same could be said for its embat-
tled head coach.
In a year where “Roll Damn Tide” 
aren’t the final words of the college foot-ball season and where the unexplainable is happening at Jordan-Hare, the weirdest thing of all may be what’s not happening with the Gators: winning.PHILLIP HEILMAN

Florida’s secondary is supposedly an 
elite unit.
The Gators boast two cornerbacks, 
Loucheiz Purifoy and Marcus Roberson, 
who are NFL draft prospects. Another, Ver-non Hargreaves III, is widely considered one of the best freshmen in the country.
Jameis Winston and the Florida State of-
fense did not seem to notice. Winston tossed three touchdowns to wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, and the No. 2 Seminoles blasted the Gators 37-7 on Saturday in Ben Hill Grif-fin Stadium.
“To go 12-0, you have to have a really, 
really good quarterback,” Trey Burton said. “He’s special.”
After completing 19 of 31 passes for 327 
yards with three scores and one intercep-tion, the redshirt freshman set the Florida State single-season record with 35 touch-down passes. Heisman Trophy winner Chris Weinke formerly held the record.
Winston also holds the record for most 
passing yards and touchdowns by a fresh-man in Atlantic Coast Conference history.
“Every day is a hard day with all the 
hard work we put out there on the field,” Winston said. “That’s one thing we do. We get in the groove, and it’s a victory. I’m not worried about my day; I’m worried about the team’s day, and we got a victory. It’s a big victory.”
While the loss is the final blow for one of 
the worst seasons in Florida football history, Florida State remained undefeated and took another step toward playing for a national title. If Florida State beats Duke in the ACC championship game Saturday, it will likely be one of the two teams playing in the BCS title game on Jan. 6.
Winston is as big a reason as any that the 
Seminoles are in this position.
Florida State entered as a four-touch-
down favorite against a reeling Florida team that has now lost seven consecutive games to end the season. After a sluggish open-ing quarter, Winston began showcasing the ability that has made him a Heisman Tro-phy candidate this season.
In the second quarter, he found Benjamin 
deep down the middle of the field. The red-shirt sophomore wideout caught the pass and powered through three members of the UF secondary to plunge into the end zone for a 45-yard touchdown.
A drive later, Benjamin initiated contact 
with Purifoy to gain separation and hauled in a 29-yard receiving touchdown. The pair connected for a third score in the fourth quarter to put the Seminoles ahead 34-7.
Benjamin finished the game with nine 
catches for 212 yards and three touchdowns, which are the most receiving yards Florida has ever allowed one player to accumulate in a game.
“He’s hard to defend,” coach Will Mus-
champ said of Benjamin. “They did a good job of getting him matched up on some of our smaller DBs by moving him around.”
The onslaught came in direct contrast to 
a Florida offense that failed to generate any momentum for much of the game.
Skyler Mornhinweg, the Gators’ redshirt 
freshman signal-caller, completed 20 of 25 passes for 115 yards and a touchdown but never provided much of a threat to the jug-gernaut Seminoles.
“Everybody started looking at the score-
board as a collective group and saying, ‘Dang, the offense is just three-and-out, three-and-out, three-and-out,’” defensive end Jonathan Bullard said. “It’s not all on them. We let them get 37 points or some-thing like that. We’ve just got to regroup and get better next year.” MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Jameis Winston attempts a pass during Florida’s 37-7 loss to Florida State on 
Saturday in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. The redshirt freshman, who is a candidate to win the Heisman Trophy this season, completed 19 of 31 passes for 327 yards and three touchdowns to help the Seminoles remain undefeated.

Tebow’s return to Gainesville not enough to spark GatorsKey injuries 
broke UF’s spirit in 2013
But every good play he made 
came with stretches of little involve-
ment. He also struggled with consis-tency as well as tackling in the open field.
His final game as a Gator fea-
tured both the good and the bad.
He recorded an early intercep-
tion of Heisman Trophy candidate Jameis Winston and downed a John-ny Townsend punt at Florida State’s 4-yard line. 
However, he surrendered three 
touchdown catches to Seminoles wideout Kelvin Benjamin.
Former Gators pay visit: Tim 
Tebow and Matt Elam visited the team on Saturday. 
Tebow is currently a free agent, 
and Elam was free after the Bal-timore Ravens defeated the Pitts-burgh Steelers 22-20 on Thanksgiv-ing Day.
“Great to see 
those guys,” Mus-champ said. “Tim came in and, of course, he com-mands an audi-ence everywhere he goes.”
Tebow did more than watch the 
game.
The former Heisman Trophy win-ner served as a motivational speaker for the Gators prior to Florida’s 37-7 loss to Florida State on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
“When I saw him, I could just 
feel his leadership,” offensive tackle Max Garcia said. 
“His presence — it just demand-
ed that. When he spoke to us, ev-eryone could see his passion for the game. I really respect him.”
Tebow tried to light a fire un-der a team that suffered its seventh straight loss on Saturday. Although his words did not propel the Gators to victory, they could come in handy as Florida prepares to rebound from a 4-8 season.
“Any man that gets down can get 
back up, but it’s the man that gets up with a change, that who’s we are,” Garcia said Tebow told the team.

Efficient Mornhinweg not enough to save hapless UF offense
explosive play, injuries yet again 
hampered Florida.
The senior wide receiver in-
jured his shoulder on the play and left the game shortly after. He re-turned to the sideline later in street clothes, his season and college ca-reer over.
“I just wish I could have been 
there to finish it up,” he said.
After Burton exited, the Gators 
averaged only 1.3 yards per carry.
Coach Will Muschamp said 
after the game that he planned to have Burton take more than 30 snaps at quarterback — a depar-ture from the previous strategy of using the Wildcat sparingly. The Gators hoped different looks could spark an offensive renaissance, but they never found out if it could work consistently.
“Some of the misdirection runs 
now go out of the game plan, so you got to make adjustments and you got to change,” Muschamp said. “It just kind of sums up what’s happened this year.”
Instead, the burden fell on quar-
terback Skyler Mornhinweg’s right arm. 
The redshirt freshman per-
formed admirably and met the goals set for him. He completed 80 percent of his passes and showed better poise with the ball, throwing it out of bounds when FSU defend-ers forced him to scramble instead of forcing passes into coverage.
However, mere completions 
were not enough. Florida State stopped the short-yardage plays before Florida’s receivers could get into open space. Mornhinweg finished with 115 passing yards, and no receiver tallied more than 23 yards in the game.
“We’ve got find ways to manu-
facture more points,” Muschamp said. “There’s no question mov-ing forward (that) we need to do that.”While the Gators struggled, the 
Seminoles soared. Led by Winston, the presumptive Heisman Trophy favorite, FSU passed its way to 456 total yards.
Redshirt sophomore Kelvin 
Benjamin received 212 of those yards, the most the Gators have ever surrendered to an opposing wide receiver. Benjamin also re-corded three touchdowns — more than all but one Florida receiver totaled this season.
“He’s long, he’s hard to get the 
ball off of,” safety Cody Riggs said. “He was running some pretty good routes today.”
Although the defense started 
strong, limiting Florida State to only three points in the first quar-ter, it was quickly overwhelmed. Short drives ended any momentum the defense handed the offense.
By halftime, the Gators could 
barely slow the Seminoles’ of-fensive juggernaut. Florida held Florida State to its lowest point to-tal of the season, but that provides little solace to a team incapable of beating even Georgia Southern — a Football Championship Subdivi-sion team.
“(It’s a) very frustrating, diffi-
cult day that ends a very frustrat-ing, difficult season,” Muschamp said. “That’s the best way I can sum it up.”
Florida’s dismantling at the 
hands of Florida State ended one of the most miserable seasons in UF’s history. It was the first los-ing season since 1979 and the first time the Gators failed to qualify for postseason play in 23 years.
Even opposing teams seem to 
be conspiring to torment Florida fans.
Barring any upsets, Florida 
State, now the top-ranked team in the nation, projects to match up against No. 2 Ohio State in the national title game — a no-win scenario for Gators fans. Whether Winston or Urban Meyer wins, Florida fans lose.
But UF is done with football for 
the year. The Gators will miss out on helpful bowl practices, and the team will disband for the offsea-son.
Muschamp remains, however, 
and has the task of rebuilding the team while on the hot seat. An-other season like this, and he will likely join Pease and Davis in the unemployment line.
Muschamp faces a challenge 
that no Florida coach has encoun-tered since Charley Pell built a win-ner out of a winless 1979 season. How do you bring a program out of the doldrums of mediocrity?
“We just have to roll your 
sleeves up and go to work,” Mus-champ said. “We’re going to have a good football team next year, I can assure you of that. Sitting in that locker room with those guys, we’re going to be fine. And that’s what’s encouraging for me. It’s damn encouraging.”
