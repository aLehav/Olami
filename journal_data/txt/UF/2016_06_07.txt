Starting July 8, all guests brought to Ga-
torNights by UF students might have to be at 
least 18 years old.
Joshua Wilson, a program coordinator for 
the Reitz Union, said although a policy change has been under consideration, the executive director has not approved it as of press time.GatorNights is a student-led program that 
brings free entertainment, such as movies and 
activities, to UF students Friday nights. 
Currently, each student can bring one 
guest to GatorNights, but this has allowed stu-
dents with families to bring young children.
“Some of the families that will come 
see GatorNights as a daycare,” said Andrea Drausal, a 20-year-old GatorNights student manager and UF family, youth and commu-nity sciences junior.
GatorNights graduate assistant Jennifer 
Hughes, 22, said the program may not be a place for children. She said families complain about activities and movies being inappropri-ate for their kids. 
Hughes said activities such as sticky walls 
and surf simulators are brought to the events, and while parents sign consent forms for kids, dangers still exist.Although unable to elaborate, Drausal said 
there was recently a scary incident involving a lack of child supervision that prompted the age requirement. 
Hughes said this rule would affect students 
with children and possibly students with younger siblings, but it would not apply to UF students under 18 years old.
“We really want to change how people 
see GatorNights into thinking, ‘This is a really 
awesome late-night college program for us,’” 
Drausal said.  GatorNights considers setting age requirement
THEY PROTESTED A FLORIDA HOUSE BILL 
THEY SAID RESTRICTS WOMEN’S 
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE.

On the corner of University Avenue and Main Street, protesters gath-
ered Friday to bring attention to Florida House Bill 1411, which they said 
restricts women’s access to reproductive services by redirecting funding meant for Planned Parenthood to other clinics.
The rally featured local reproductive rights and services groups. It was 
followed by a beneﬁ  t event at the Wooly, which hosted a silent auction and a dance party.
The protest gained momentum from a viral video of activist Cara Jen-
nings yelling at Gov. Rick Scott in a downtown Gainesville Starbucks in April, Jennings said.
Jennings said she did not know her encounter with Scott was taped. 
The resulting video was viewed across the world and covered by more than 800 news outlets, she said. 
Jennings said the video did not show the calm questions she asked, 
which were repeatedly deﬂ  ected by Scott.
“Let’s be clear, the guy is scary, and he’s part of a state legislature 
that’s even scarier,” she said. “He wields power so brutally.”
Jennings and a number of local and regional groups organized the 
rally to bring attention to the community and raise money for the organi-zations experiencing cuts to their funding from the governor’s restrictive new laws, she said.  Protesters rally in

A bar in Gainesville’s Midtown recently 
closed its doors, and it’s unclear when the bar 
will reopen.
Balls, located at 1716 W. University Ave., 
currently has a revoked liquor license, accord-
ing to the Florida Department of Business and 
Professional Regulation.“I was there around the end of April,” said  
Avery Guyton, a 21-year-old UF Spanish and 
public relations senior. “It had to of closed 
just a couple weeks ago.”
William Chick opened the sports bar 
in 1989, according to his obituary in The Gainesville Sun. 
Chick died Feb. 14, 2013, but he is still 
listed as the bar’s director on the Florida De-partment of State Division of Corporations’ website. 
Max Schmidt, a 22-year-old UF aerospace 
engineering ﬁ  fth-year student, said he visited the bar in March and heard about the impend-ing closure from a bartender. 
He said in a text message that the license 
was never renewed after Chick died, and it could cost about $200,000 to pay for late fees and a new license. 
Manager Tim Blakey could not be reached for comment as of press time.  
Guyton said he hopes Balls, a place where 
he ﬁ  nds the area’s cheapest drinks until mid-night, will reopen soon, but he doubts the doors will open until Fall.
“It smells a little bit and people get pretty 
rowdy,” he said, “but it’s a 21-and-up bar, so you don’t have little freshman trying to take your space.”

Each weekend, members of 
the homeless community in 
Gainesville wait in line to receive 
free food from a group of diverse UF students.
Project Downtown Gainesville 
is a nonprofit organization that 
distributes free meals to home-
less people in front of City Hall, 
located at 200 E. University Ave.The group is mostly com-
posed of UF students from dif-
ferent cultures, said Ikramamul Nibir, the outreach coordinator 
of the project.
He said the organization usu-
ally has 10 volunteers serving 
food for more than 100 homeless people every weekend.
Nibir said the group normally 
assigns a person to be the spon-sor, who is in charge of cooking for one day each weekend.
On May 29, the menu in-cluded chicken, rice and pasta. 
Volunteers gave out all the food 
in about 20 minutes, said Jeena Kar, the sponsor for that day.
Nibir said the most important 
thing the organization needs is 
more promotion and recognition. 
He said he is upset with the way some politicians and news media manipulate the image of immi-
grants in America — especially 
the Muslim community. 
Nibir said he is tired of hear-
ing people make comparisons between extremist groups and 
people like the volunteers, who 
are committed to helping others and making this country better 
on a weekly basis.
Bernice Darby said Project 
Downtown Gainesville has fed 
her several times.
“Not too many people come 
down here and feed the home-
less and think about the home-
less and show love like they do,” she said.Gainesville citizens show care, support to less fortunate

A FIVE STAR PIZZA EMPLOYEE 
WAS ATTACKED IN MAY.
By Sara Marino
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville Police arrested a boy in 
connection with the May 30 attack on a 
Five Star Pizza delivery man.
A GPD detective arrested 17-year-old 
David McClain near his Gainesville home 
last Thursday, and McClain then told po-
lice about the attack, Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
McClain told authorities he called 
a girl in Rhode Island and asked her to order pizzas to an address at Granada Apartments, Tobis wrote.
Nobody answered the door when de-
livery driver Jacob Case, 23, arrived at about 12:30 a.m., according to Alligator archives.He then walked back to his car, where 
McClain appeared with an axe handle and beat Case to the ground, Tobias wrote. 
After his arrest, McClain showed po-
lice the clothing he wore and the weapon he used during the robbery, Tobias wrote. 
The bottom of McClain’s shoes matched 
shoeprints found at the robbery scene.
McClain is currently on probation for a 
robbery in January 2015, when he joined 
a group of people and ordered pizzas to 
a vacant home. They then used pepper spray to rob the driver, Tobias wrote. 
Case said Five Star Pizza offered a 
$3,000 reward to anyone who helped 
catch the robbery suspect, which he will 
now use to pay medical bills or rent. 
“I guess I’m relieved that he can’t do it 
to other people,” Case said. “He probably 
would have done it again.”

In 2013, Anthony Waters nearly died 
while doing what he loves.
The 19-year-old UF microbiology sopho-
more said he was 16 when he turned his 
motorcycle on an Orlando road and a car 
slammed into him. 
“I got hit right in the perfect spot, be-
cause an inch higher would be punctured 
lung and broken rib territory, and then an inch lower would be crushed stomach and intestines, and I would probably be living on a machine for I don’t know how long,” 
he said. 
Motorcycle deaths in Florida increased 
more than 23 percent between 2014 and 
2015, according to a recent press release from the American Automobile Association. 
Of the 554 deaths in 2015, only two happened in Alachua County, according 
to a preliminary report from the Florida 
Department of Highway Safety and Motor 
Vehicles. 
Nineteen counties had zero deaths, and 
Miami-Dade has the highest number of deaths at 56. The next highest numbers are 48 (Hillsborough) and 39 (Broward). 
Each motorcycle death costs society 
about $1.5 million, according to the release. The estimate calculates factors such as lost productivity, legal fees and the cost of emer-
gency services. 
Waters said distracted drivers, especially 
those who use a phone while behind the 
wheel, are the biggest danger.
“I honestly see every single time I drive 
somebody on their phone or just plain out distracted,” he said.

The former guitarist of a Gainesville band 
is scheduled to appear in court July 7 for 
charges of sexual assault against a minor.
Gainesville Police arrested 30-year-old 
Dennis Young, a past member of Former 
Planets, on May 19. He was released the 
same night on a $190,000 bond.
On Nov. 30, police recorded a statement 
from the survivor, who told a detective that Young assaulted her when she was about 6 or 7, according to the report. Young traveled to Tennessee when he heard about the girl’s statement. 
Young ﬁ  rst showed the girl a pornographic 
video on his phone, according to the report. He then talked about sex and rubbed the girl’s vagina over her clothing. 
He now faces charges for sexual assault 
and obscene communication, along with two charges for lewd and las-civious behavior, according to Alachua County court re-
cords. 
A current member of 
Former Planet, who wished 
to remain anonymous, 
said he was surprised to hear about the accusations against Young, who seemed 
kind and creative. 
“He called and said his ex-girlfriend was 
making these claims,” he said. “They had been together for many years.” 
The man said Young last played with For-
mer Planets on Oct. 16, and nobody has seen or heard from him since. 
“I would say that we need to wait until all 
of the information is out there,” he said.

Build drones?
Well, dear readers, this is it. We’re calling it. The end 
is nigh — and not the cool kind of Nye we all know and love from probably the only thing we liked in elementary school more than recess: “Bill! Bill! Bill!” (If this reference went over your head, you need 
some more science and bowties in your life!) But for real, the coming months are basically life-or-death… or move to Canada.
Wal-Mart is well on its way to using drones. Yes, you heard 
that right. The megastore plans to implement drones for moni-toring inventory at its warehouses and distribution centers across the country. Designers and engineers estimate the new technology will be able to scan as many products in one day as a human worker can scan with hand-held technology in one month, according to an RT report.
For those of you who’ve seen any sort of apocalyptic thriller 
or contemplated the end of days in light of recent political news — we’re right there with ya — you know what’s about to hap-pen. It always starts with talks of “convenience” — customer satisfaction, efficiency, sales optimization, etc. Then, all of a 
sudden, you and Arnold Schwarzenegger are fighting for your 
lives to keep Skynet from uploading.
Don’t just take our word for it. Look to the way leading 
researchers and Wal-Mart spokespeople are describing the 
technology. Shekar Natarajan, Wal-Mart’s vice president of en-gineering sciences, told reporters, “We are still in early phases of testing and understanding how drones can be better used in different types of business functions.”
Different types of business functions: What are the implica-
tions of this? Around the world, people reportedly fear clear, open skies because of the imminent threat to civilian life that U.S. drones present. With drones loyal to Wal-Mart abound in our city streets, what happens if you get the sudden urge to shop at Target one day or take a stroll over to Publix for a classic sub? 
Are we supposed to just accept the fact that at any point it’s 
bye-bye to the soccer mom who chose to buy a Publix cheese-cake for her child’s birthday instead of those imposter concoc-tions in Wal-Mart’s “dessert” aisles?
Read between the lines, dear readers. They court us with 
their yellow smiley face logo and offensively polite door greet-ers; meanwhile they amass a secret drone army to forcibly direct our consumer allegiance to their shopping aisles alone, picking off one-by-one those who would take their business elsewhere. 
We at the Alligator say to this, no more. We the people will 
develop an addiction to low-price retail shopping on our own terms, thank you very much. It’s time we stood together and said enough is enough; it’s time we fight back.
Now, some of you have never seen the face of battle, and 
we’re up against a god-king: a corporate monopoly, armed with all of its drones, whose Gross Domestic Product is larger than 
most countries. But we’re neither helpless nor alone. We’re 
armed with the might of all the hipster thrift stores, the mom-
and-pop-locally-sourced vegan restaurants and, of course, the fearless, CIA-trained squirrel army of UF. We are a force to be reckoned with.
And to those who would doubt our cause, who would de-
cry our free-market insurgency with a cry, “This is madness!” we urge you to stand your ground and remind them: This. Is. Gainesville.Trump, his protesters and American democracy
If you ask the average person on the street 
what the definition of democracy is, they will usually include answers such as “one 
person, one vote” and the rights of citi-
zens. While these may be true, there is 
a lot more to successful democracy than just the basic definitions that are popular to the 
general public. Things such as rule of law and 
peaceful transition of power to an opponent are key in order for democracy to continue without slipping into authoritarianism.
Since America’s founding, democracy has been prac-
ticed, even if it was far from perfect —  i.e., prohibit-ing voting for minorities and women. But some of the most important institutions that kept democracy afloat were developed and maintained to prevent the rise of 
authoritarians.
Fast forward to today, and it seems democracy in the 
U.S. is facing obstruction from both sides of the political 
aisle. Donald Trump has begun to take shots at some of the fundamental building blocks that prevent authori-
tarianism from taking root.
This past week, for example, Trump took assault on 
Gonzalo Curiel, the federal district judge who is presid-
ing over the Trump University case. As Trump claims, 
Curiel’s Mexican heritage is a conflict of interest with 
Trump’s policy of building a wall on the border.
This is a direct challenge to the rule of law and the 
ability to be unbiased within the courtroom. Even if this is just a “special” case and Trump will not continue this 
kind of attack against other judges, it could set a prec-
edent for the presidents to come.
Free press has also come under the assault of an 
angry Trump, with him calling certain reporters sleazy 
and all of them corrupt. When asked if the White House 
Press Corps. would have similar experiences during a Trump administration, the answer seemed to lean to-ward a yes. The press used to be one of the main barriers against corruption or perver-sion of rights by the government. This could 
change in a Trump presidency.
Finally, the protesters that have organized 
outside of Trump rallies and descended them 
into violence should be mentioned as well. 
While their actions are deplorable and should 
not be accepted as de facto behavior against any idea, these protests could shape up to be things to come as the general election gets 
closer and people become more polarized, especially 
along racial lines that have become the center of this 
year’s campaign.
These events do not singularly point to a collapse of 
democracy or a movement toward authoritarianism, but 
they are not positive signs of the movement in Ameri-
can democracy. While protesters who attack Trump supporters are a cause for concern and should be dealt with accordingly, the actions of Trump will have a lon-ger impact on our political system than protestors out-
side of a rally.
Trump’s attacks on judges and the media show a 
clear dislike for institutions that regularly keep checks 
on the executive powers of the U.S. and prevent it from 
becoming an authoritarian’s dream job.
There are other institutions we have yet to see Trump 
interact with, and we would not know how that would 
be unless he is elected president. Institutions such as Congress, where Trump has no experience getting legis-
lation through, might be places where Trump wants to 
cut corners or lay down insults in order to get what he wants, but governing is about compromise, something he hasn’t figured out yet.

opinions@alligator.orgOne of the less “typical” courses avail-
able here at UF is titled “Harry Pot-ter and the Holocaust.” I’ve had the privilege of taking it. While I could write a column about that class alone 
— send an email, and maybe I will — there’s one theme I want to ramble about this week.
I hope the Harry Potter series was as much 
a part of your childhood as it was mine. I can honestly say I feel like a better person simply because I had loved the wonderful wizard-ing world. The character development was so well drawn-out; the plot was as rich as it was thick, and the line of morality was constantly being blurred. That’s what good children’s art does: It takes serious moral (“adult”) ques-tions and themes and develops them for an audience that will one day have to answer them.
More importantly, J.K. Rowling had the 
courage to answer those questions wrong. Children’s literature almost always ends up answering those questions right. It would seem that with children’s literature, the “moral of the story” goes hand in hand with the plot. But some-times you’re forced to deal with less than ideal truths: questions of fairness (Should Harry have told Cedric about the dragon challenge in “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire”?), privacy (those eerie Oc-clumency lessons in “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix”) and bravery (constantly bringing your noncon-senting fellow teenage friends into fights that could render them killed or worse, expelled). And these challenges lead to other moral di-lemmas: “Should I harbor innocent but vi-ciously persecuted fugitives if doing so could result in grave consequences for my family?” That question is not only asked in Harry Pot-ter.
Another fantastic example of great chil-
dren’s art is “Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs.” When this cartoon originally premiered in 1993, it was revolu-tionary. While it does not neces-sarily go into depth of moral ques-tions, the humor evoked from each episode was intentionally designed to keep young and adult audiences in mind. There are wacky and zany slapstick gags (I love me a good ol' Acme Piano falling from the sky onto an unsuspecting villain’s head) that are meant for children. 
Adults could smirk alongside when obvious sexual “things” slipped by a child’s ear com-pletely unnoticed (“Hellooooooo Nurse!” say Wakko and Yakko as their out-of-body heart-beats start to slowly slide down their pants). The Wheel of Morality often pitted viewers against each other (“If at first you don’t suc-ceed, blame it on your parents”), breaking down the fourth wall in a way that is so goofy kids enjoy it seriously, and adults can’t help but chuckle at the sheer cringy-ness of it all (“Win a Free Trip to Tahiti!”).Children’s art, like all art, inherently re-
flects the creators' understanding of the so-cial environment we occupy. Whether you’re Schubert or Kendrick, Dickens or Rowling, Coppola or Spielberg, there’s something in-herent in art that grants us access to the re-alities of one another and question the under-standing of our own. Children’s art embodies this in a way that no other artistic medium can, and by that virtue alone, it demands we focus on it in a way that is as enjoyable as it is informative. Questions about Mudbloods seemed real in a different reality, but ques-tions of hiding Jews were all too familiar in ours. I want you all, dear Summer A readers, to ask the morally charged questions of our time, like whether to accept refugees, to shoot the critically endangered gorilla or to build a wall (my heresy just made it 10 feet higher, it’s gonna be HUGE) and ask yourself: What would Hermione Granger do?

UWire
The music industry is absurd. It’s been that way for ages, only intensified by the dawn of social media, auto-tune and autobiographical documentaries about 21-year-old pop stars. Thus, it’s 
an easy target for parody.
With “Popstar: Don’t Stop Never Stop-
ping,” The Lonely Island, the comedic trio of Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jor-ma Taccone, has taken a well-trodden path through mockumentary territory, while also delivering a consistently enjoyable film dense with their familiar sensibility.
“Popstar” follows the life of Connor-
4Real (Samberg), an amalgamation of Justin Bieber, Macklemore and all four members of One Direction. A former boy band star gone solo, the film charts his world tour as a strug-gling sophomore album digs into his wildly inflated ego. Schaffer and Taccone (who also directed the film) play the scorned mem-bers of Connor’s former group, the Style Boyz. But as one may expect, the story is a little more than an excuse to string together a series of outlandish comedic beats, celebri-ty cameos and catchy pop songs, covering topics from gay rights to fucking a girl, “like the U.S. government fucked Bin Laden!”
The Lonely Island broke into the main-
stream on “Saturday Night Live,” with a se-ries of “Digital Shorts” that came to define an entire generation of the iconic sketch show. Hits like “I’m On a Boat,” “Jizz In My Pants” and “Jack Sparrow” bril-liantly mixed brash, idiotic humor with genuinely catchy beats for hilarious earworms. The music of “Popstar” is mostly up to snuff, feeling very musically similar to past Lonely Island releases with a touch of modern pop flare. The film is never afraid to take a mo-ment and let the songs speak for themselves, boasting nearly full-
length music videos and concert snippets to get the joke across.
When the comedy is non-musical, the 
trio falls back on many of the same tricks to keep the laughs coming. The film is a pa-rade of cameos, both from the world of mu-sic and comedy: It’s possible more people in the credits are credited as themselves than as characters. It’s overwhelming, yet often works in the film’s favor by rounding out a small cast with ceaseless appearances from bigger stars. Some jokes occasionally rely upon the appearance of celebrities as punch-lines, which prove effective in the theater, but may tire out on subsequent viewings. Re-gardless, the gags come fast and hard and hit on the mark more often than not.
Sometimes, recommending a film is as 
easy as pointing to an artist’s past work, and saying “If you like that, see this.” If you’ve ever cracked a smile at one of The Lonely Island’s many past offerings, “Popstar” will have something for you to love.
A version of this column by Chris Berg 
originally ran in The Daily Emerald. Children’s art embodies the understanding of ourselves and each other

UWireMovie review: ‘Popstar' is predictable, yet charming and enjoyable8   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 2016
The money raised by the event 
went to the Southern Birth Justice 
Network, which supplies reproduc -
tive services to women of color in the South, and to the local women’s clinic Bread and Roses.
Kendra Vincent, the chairwoman 
of the Gainesville chapter of National 
Women’s Liberation, led the protest 
outside and asked participants to speak about their experiences trying to get birth control, abortions or basic reproductive health care. 
Vincent said she used the rally to introduce a media campaign that brings attention to how the State Leg
-
islature redirects women to clinics for reproductive services that don’t actu
-
ally provide those services.
Vincent said she asked women to 
call those offices and ask for services traditionally offered by clinics such as Planned Parenthood and then share 
their experiences on social media with 
#NotMyClinic. 
The offices listed for Alachua 
County are Azalea Dental and Palms Medical Group, neither of which pro
-
vide birth control, pap smears or abor -
tions, she said.
“Abortion rights were not given to us,” she said. “We worked long and hard for them. We need complete and 
total access.”
Speaker Emily Calvin talked about 
accessing reproductive health care as 
a student. Calvin said she went on and off student insurance during her time as a law school student, and because she never had a primary doctor and often couldn’t afford to visit private clinics, she went to Planned Parent
-
hood. 
She said at Planned Parenthood, 
her questions were answered accu -
rately and kindly, which didn’t hap -
pen at her university’s women’s clinic.
“Everyone was patient and kind and caring,” she said. “I was practi -
cally showered in birth control.”
At the rally, four women participat -
ed in a performance art piece, dressing in white and wearing blindfolds while walking into the four intersections at University Avenue and Main Street. They did not speak, and right before 
the rally moved inside, the four per
-
formers removed more than 30 feet of 
white ribbon from their mouths. 
Lorna Bouret, Van Tran, Veronica 
Robleto and Mary Doyle choreo -
graphed the outside performance and an inside dance routine. They said the act was meant to show the way women are meant to be seen as pure in society, and the ribbon was meant to show how women lose their voice in society. 
The performers said their dance 
inside the Wooly contrasted their qui
-
eter performance, showing women’s empowerment by dancing to “Bad Girls” by M.I.A.
“We experimented with the idea of 
putting our bodies in the line of dan
-
ger, which is what women do all the time,” Doyle said.

Six years ago, McClain Kes-
sler was sitting in his living room 
with his grandfather, Andrew Driggers, watching a Florida 
men’s basketball game.
The Gators were facing the 
N.C. State Wolfpack and trailed 
by two points with two seconds left in the game.
Livid that UF appeared to 
be headed for a loss, Driggers stormed outside, unable to look at the television any longer.
What followed was one of 
Florida basketball’s most incred-ible plays in program history.
After a missed free throw by 
N.C. State, UF forward Chandler Parsons dribbled twice before hurling a prayer from 75 feet away, nailing the shot as time expired.
Gators 62, Wolfpack 61.In shock, Kessler went out-
side and found his still-enraged grandfather.
“I come outside and am like, 
‘You just missed an incredible shot,’" McClain said.
“He didn’t believe me. Even 
for a couple days. He would 
watch the replay and he still 
wouldn’t believe me. I don’t know what was going on, but it was the funniest thing ever.”
Kessler, a freshman on the 
Florida men’s tennis team, was best friends with Driggers.
After deciding to be home-
schooled as a teenager in order 
to devote more time to tennis, 
the Calhoun, Georgia, native was frequently on the road training and participating in tournaments across the southeast.
When Kessler wasn’t travel-ing, however, he was at home with his grandfather. 
The relationship they cultivat-
ed was one of the main reasons Kessler committed to the Gators.
Following a stint in the Air 
Force during World War II, Drig-gers enrolled at UF and walked 
on to the football team as a line-
backer in 1948.
Driggers developed an adora-
tion for Florida during his time at the university, an adoration that stayed with him long after he graduated in 1950.“He loved Gator sports,” Mc-
Clain said.
“I grew up watching bas-
ketball games, football, every-thing with him. Every Saturday was scheduled around watching games with him. I would take off tennis and not play and just 
watch Florida sports.”
 Kessler grew a fondness for 
the Gators early on in his child-hood, creating an unbreakable 
bond with his grandfather. 
The two would often sit to-
gether, and McClain would lis-ten as Driggers recounted stories about his experiences at UF.
“He had a lot of quality time 
with my dad, and that’s proba-bly the best teacher that you can have,” McClain’s mother, Julie Kessler, said. 
“Eighty nine years of life that 
McClain probably knows more about my dad than I do.”
 It’s difficult to find someone 
more animated on a tennis court than Kessler.
The freshman yells and shouts 
his way through every match he plays.
Sometimes it’s encourag-
ing phrases, such as “Let’s go Gators!”
Other times it’s exclamations 
of relief following a big point, like “Come on! Yeah!”
And sometimes, McClain is so 
fired up his words are simply un-intelligible.
No matter what sound is com-
ing from Kessler, his teammates always appreciate his emotion.
“Even if he’s winning or los-
ing, he’s going to be screaming, and that just pumps you up,” sophomore Chase Perez-Blanco 
said. 
“It just brings a smile to my 
face when I hear him going nuts. 
I think it’s just fun, and it’s just a lot of fun watching him do that because he’s so good at it.”
McClain has had a lot of prac-
tice roaring over the intensity of a tennis rally.
Kessler’s mother still has a 
home video of an 8-year-old Mc-Clain furiously hitting a ball off his family’s garage wall, shout-ing triumphantly after each fore-hand.
“He annihilated our drywall,” 
Julie said. 
“We had to have a contractor 
come in and put plywood in our garage.”
It’s not a coincidence Kessler 
is forceful and aggressive in his style of play. 
It’s in his genes.Driggers was the epitome of 
an ultimate competitor. 
The former UF linebacker was 
assertive and backed down from no one.
Even his grandson.“(He was the) most competi-A BEST-FRIEND RELATIONSHIP

UF TRAVELS TO OREGON ON 
WEDNESDAY FOR THE NCAA 
OUTDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS.
By Lauren Staff
Sports Writer
 
Last one, best one. 
That is the mantra Florida coach Mike 
Holloway has emphasized to his athletes from the beginning of indoor season until now. On Wednesday, the Gators head to Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, to try to capture their first NCAA Outdoor Champi-onship since 2013 in their last track meet 
of the season. At the NCAA East Prelimi-
nary in May, Florida qualified 25 entries for the four-day meet.
But the athletes on the No. 2 men’s and 
No. 9 women’s teams will have to have season-best times if they want a chance to dethrone the Oregon Ducks, who have 32 total entries in this year’s championship. The No. 3 Duck’s men’s team has won 
back-to-back outdoor titles while the No. 
6 women’s team took home the crown in 2015.
The Gators will also 
be at a disadvantage in 
the 200-meter dash. Kyra Jefferson, who holds the UF record in the event, 
was battling injuries and 
was unable to qualify at the East Preliminary. She was also unable to com-
pete in the 4x100 relay and will not travel 
to Eugene.
However, both of the 4x400 relay teams for the men’s and women’s teams qualified 
and will present a challenge to every team they face. Freshman thrower Anders Eriks-son, who became the first UF freshman to qualify in the event for the NCAA Champi-onships since 2002, is someone who could help Florida's men's team garner enough points to help them bring a championship back to Gainesville.
Competition begins Wednesday.

BASEBALL
Staff Report
After the 90-miles-per-hour fast-
ball hit Peter Alonso’s left hand, the 
junior had one thought.
“I thought I wasn’t gonna be able 
to play as a Gator again,” he said.
Three weeks later, Alonso was 
named the Gainesville Regional’s Most Outstanding Player. He hit three home runs in three games, he went 8-for-14 with eight RBIs, and he led Florida’s offense to three-straight wins.
His left hand is doing just ﬁ  ne 
now.
“Having that thought, I don’t 
know, it’s kind of scary,” Alonso said. “I’m back and it feels good.”
On Sunday, Florida, a No. 1 na-
tional seed, advanced to the NCAA Super Regionals for the second-con-secutive year with a 10-1 win over Georgia Tech and will host Florida State next weekend.
The Gators are riding the mo-
mentum from a weekend in which it outscored its opponents 25-9. 
Here’s how it happened:
Game 1, Friday: Florida 9, Bet-
hune-Cookman 3
The ﬁ  rst sign Florida would be 
getting the Alonso of old came in his 
ﬁ  rst at-bat.
The junior walked up to home 
plate and hit a home run to left-
center ﬁ  eld, giving UF a 2-0 lead in the ﬁ  rst inning and emptying the Gators’ dugout.
“It’s funny how things work like 
that. The guy has been out for 27 days,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said after the game. “You kind of have to have a little magic this time of year.”Alonso’s return kick-started UF’s 
offense — of the junior’s ﬁ  rst three at-bats, two were home runs.
Freshman Danny Reyes ﬁ  nished 
second on the team with two hits and tied Alonso’s three RBIs, in-cluding a two-run triple in the third inning that increased the Gators’ lead to 6-0.
Meanwhile, junior Logan Shore 
(11-0) didn’t have his best day on the mound, giving up three runs and ﬁ  ve hits while striking out four batters through six innings. But the right-hander played well enough to 
limit Bethune-Cookman’s offense 
for most of the game.
“I didn’t pitch as well as I could 
have,” Shore said. “But I think it’s a good stepping stone going into next weekend.” 
Game 2, Saturday: Florida 6, 
UConn 5 
While Alonso homered again on 
Saturday, his offense wasn’t the dif-ference maker against the Huskies. 
Instead, freshman Jonathan In-
dia hit a solo shot in the top of the eighth inning to give UF a one-run lead, a margin the Gators preserved en-route to their second win of the Regional.
Along with his homer,  Alonso 
went 2-for-5 with an opposite-ﬁ  eld single.
While Alonso and India led the 
offense, A.J. Puk led the pitching. But the results weren’t nearly as en-
couraging.
In his last appearance before 
Thursday’s MLB Draft, the possible 
ﬁ  rst-overall pick lasted 4.1 innings and allowed four earned runs. 
Dane Dunning came on in relief of Puk in the ﬁ  fth inning and lasted through the eighth, throwing 39 pitches and setting up Shaun Ander-son for his 13th save of the season. 
“I thought (Dunning) was prob-
ably the story of the game pitching-wise,” O’Sullivan said. 
Game 3, Sunday: Florida 10, 
Georgia Tech 1
Florida only needed two runs to 
hold off Georgia Tech and earn its second-straight Super Regional ap-pearance.
Instead, it got 10.
Florida’s ﬁ  rst run came courtesy 
of catcher Mike Rivera, who drove 
in Alonso on a hard-hit grounder to left in the top of the ﬁ  rst inning. 
From there, Alonso took over.  After hitting three homers in the 
ﬁ  rst two games combined, Alonso didn’t get one over the fence on Sunday, but he drove in three runs 
and picked up three more hits. 
“Pete had an unbelievable week-
end,” O’Sullivan said. “I’m not 
quite sure what to make of it.”
The regional was Alonso’s last 
appearance before the Draft, where the junior is expected to be selected in the ﬁ  rst few rounds. 
Meanwhile, sophomore Alex 
Faedo was electric in his eight shut-out innings, striking out 10 and al-lowing just four hits and a walk. 
“His breaking stuff was unbe-
lievable,” Georgia Tech shortstop Connor Justus said. 
Next up for Florida is the Super 
Regionals, which will be a best-of three-game series against rival FSU in Gainesville next weekend. The winner of the series will advance to the College World Series.   UF wins three straight, advances to Super Regionals

tive person ever,” McClain said. 
“Christmas we would have 
different games and he would 
always try to win. He would do whatever it took to beat me 
when I was like 7 or 8 years 
old.”
Driggers’ relentless desire to 
win ingratiated itself into Kes-sler’s core at a very young age.Over a decade later, that de-
termination still burns within McClain, leading the freshman to have a big impact in his first 
season at Florida. 
Kessler finished his 2016 
campaign 14-6 in dual singles 
matches and tallied eight wins in Southeastern Conference play.
“Anything I do, I’m probably 
the louder person there, and the most intense and focused and fired up about it,” McClain said. “It’s just any sport. I love it, and especially tennis is where I can leave it all out on the court.”
 Kessler committed to the Uni-
versity of Florida in early 2014.
The top-ranked recruit also 
received interest from Georgia, Georgia Tech and Alabama, but 
when it came time to make a de-
cision, the choice was obvious.
“(Florida) was basically a no-
brainer,” McClain said. 
“I looked at other places. My 
friends, everybody that I grew up with went to different places so I looked at them. The pro-grams were nice, but it was a no-brainer.”
Not only was Kessler enam-
ored with UF, but UF was also enamored with Kessler.
The five-star prospect 
matched what Florida coach Bryan Shelton wanted in an in-coming player: fire, determina-tion and grit.
“One of the things that we 
were looking for in that class was to bring in obviously talent, but to bring in a competitive spirit, almost an edgy competi-
tive spirit,” Shelton said. 
“He fit the bill. It doesn’t take 
long to watch him play and see 
how competitive he is on the court.”
If Kessler had even a shred 
of trepidation about his col-lege choice, those doubts were quickly washed away after he had a conversation with his grandfather about the Gators’ fan base.
“He said the fans obviously 
were really loyal and the best,” McClain said. 
“He said everybody gets ad-
dicted to it and they love watch-ing, and it’d be a great place to go … He loved it more than any-thing.”
 
•   •   •
Driggers’ temper boiling over 
at the thought of Florida losing a basketball game to N.C. State encapsulates just how much the Gators meant to him.
The former UF lineback-
er lived and breathed Florida sports. 
He was the definition of a 
die-hard fan, and he imparted that passion on the rest of his family.
“I was born in orange and 
blue,” Julie said. 
“I grew up my whole life go-
ing to Florida games.”
Driggers owned UF football 
season tickets for over 50 years, taking his kids and grandkids to the Swamp as often as he could.
When the team wasn’t play-
ing in Gainesville, Driggers would organize family get-to-
gethers to celebrate and prepare 
for Florida’s upcoming game.
“We’d have parties pretty 
much in advance, like days be-fore,” McClain said.
“We’d just sit around and talk 
about those games, and it was pretty fun. My grandad would run the events, and we’d do dif-ferent things, but he loved it.”
Driggers passed away on July 
1, 2015, at age 89.
Surrounding his hospital bed, 
Driggers’ entire family was pres-ent to say goodbye to him. Ev-eryone except his grandson.
Kessler had left Calhoun one 
week earlier to begin his fresh-
man year at UF.
With McClain over five hours 
away in Gainesville, he was put 
on speakerphone to say fare-well.
“McClain was probably the 
last person to say goodbye,” Ju-lie said. “That was probably the hardest.”
In his final few years, Drig-
gers’ body began to wear down due to various health problems. One thing that never left him, however, was his passion for athletics.
“Even when he was sick he 
would stroll out to the matches, and try to come to my junior 
matches,” McClain said.
 “He always, always loved 
sports. More than anybody I 
have ever seen in my life.”
Although he never got to see 
his grandson play for his be-loved alma mater, the impact that Driggers had on McClain will last forever.
“He is the reason that Mc-
Clain is the way he is about Florida,” Julie said. 
“There’s just no question."
