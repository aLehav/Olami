Keep up.
Her goal was to keep up 
with one of the most highly 
decorated pitchers in UF history in 
just her freshman year. 
She did.Sophomore Hannah Rogers, a fi-
nalist for Florida’s Gatorade Pitcher of the Year and an EA Sports Softball second-team All-American while at Lake Wales High, was brought to Gainesville to support then-senior and No. 1 starter, Stephanie Brom-bacher. 
A year before, the Gators suffered 
without a reliable No. 2 pitcher. Bro-mbacher carried the team to a third straight Women’s College World Series, but could not provide coach Tim Walton a title alone. Bringing in Rogers was just sup-posed to help relieve Brombacher of the stress she held onto in 2010. 
Instead, Walton end-
ed up splitting starts between Rogers, then a freshman, and Brom-bacher throughout last season. In this system, Rogers compiled 36 wins, 10 shutouts and 221 strikeouts, all UF freshman records. 
“She got put in some 
trials last year and pitch-ing in the [Women’s College World Series] definitely will benefit her in the long run,” Brom-bacher said. “She knows what it’s like pitching with the pressure on and she grew a lot her freshman sea-son.”
Blossoming into the go-to pitcher 
for Florida in 2012, Rogers has much to look forward to at UF.
But the future of the program 
may be approaching quickly in her rearview mirror. Highly touted re-cruits, Alyssa Bache and Lauren Haeger, were recruited by Walton to push Florida to new heights.
“If you bring in players of equal 
or greater caliber than the players you already have,” Walton said, “it should build competition amongst pitchers and players altogether.”
  
Bache and Haeger were both 
nominated for the MaxPreps Na-tional Softball Player of the Year award and were named 2011 ESPN Rise Under Armour All-Americans. Hauling in pitchers of their caliber 
strikingly resem-
bles Rogers com-ing to the aid of Brombacher and the Gators for the 2011 season.
However, having three young ca-
pable starters will change Walton’s strategy going into this season. And all three will have to compete for time on the mound.
“Players always ask, ‘What’s it 
going to take for me to get in the lineup?’ First, they have to have confidence in themselves,” Walton said. “And they have to get it done. I don’t care if we’re playing Long Island or if we’re playing Alabama, the first game and last game of our season. 
“Every competitive situation 
is the exact same, you got to come through. If you can’t come through, then your opportunities will be a little less than those that do come through.”
Strengthened by the nation’s top-
ranked recruiting class, according to ESPN Rise, Walton now has an arse-nal of pitchers at his disposal. And he said he won’t mind giving more playing time to those who deserve 
it.
“With the young players, 
comes expectations of play-ing in a lot of games,” Walton said. “So we’re just going to have to manage those expec-tations and try to get Alyssa and Lauren into as many suc-cessful situations as we can.”
Even with a potentially 
strong pitching staff, Walton does not plan to go with a rotation. Instead, he said he 
wants to lean on Rogers and use Bache and Hae-ger when he deems fit. 
But Rogers said she 
expects to see an equal 
division of time on the mound.
“I feel like we’re all going to have 
equal playing time because we’re all great pitchers,” Rogers said. “If I’m having a bad day, then Lauren or Al-yssa is going to come in and help me out, or if (they) are having a bad day, then we’re going to be there to help each other out.”
Not since 2006 have the Gators 
had three or more starters collect at least 10 starts in a season.
Walton, who took over as head 
coach in 2006, has mostly maintained a strong duo of starters, with one usually earning slightly more starts than the other. For the past several years, Brombacher has been the reli-able rock that the team leaned on.
“The change is good for the pro-
gram,” Brombacher said. “The pitch-ing staff is young, but they’re going to get good experience and that’s go-ing to help them in the later years. With three of them, they’re all going to get a decent amount of pitching time, which is crucial for them when in their older years.”
Last year, being the mentee, Rog-
ers soaked up any advice and tips given to her by Brombacher. Now, with the departure of Brombacher, and Rogers suddenly thrust into a leadership position on a young team, Rogers has tried to pass on Brombacher’s knowledge to Bache and Haeger.
“Stephanie helped me out a lot 
last year, so I’m trying to do the same for them,” Rogers said. 
And if any sophomore is right 
for this job, Brombacher believes it is Rogers.
“I believe she can do it, and hope-
fully what she learned last year she can help the freshmen learn this year.”
Having these freshmen come in is 
not just a one-way street. Rogers is there to help the youth adjust, while the newcomers are there to push Rogers. 
Although sharing her starts po-
tentially means Rogers’ numbers will undergo a significant drop from last year, she said she is fine with the move and is not threatened by hav-ing a strong class of pitchers behind her, despite the warnings of Walton.
She says help couldn’t hurt.“It’s going to be great this 
year,” Rogers said. “It’s tough go-ing through the season, like when Stephanie was hurt, doing it all by yourself.”
Carrying the burden of an entire 
team took its toll on Rogers while Brombacher was injured last sea-son. She had to pick up the slack of the staff, giving her more innings pitched (265.2) and appearances (55) than any other freshman in UF his-tory.
Although both Bache and Hae-
ger have the potential to be the No. 1 starter for a number of schools around the nation, it isn’t playing time that motivates them. Instead, it’s winning.When asked about possibly being 
discouraged with their current posi-tion on the pitching staff this season, Bache and Haeger responded with an emphatic, “No.”
“I have complete faith in our 
coaching staff and our team,” Hae-ger said. “We’re doing what we can to win. We’re here to back each other up.”
Rogers knows Walton has two 
potential  All-Americans in his back pocket. 
Breathing down her back. Vying for a start. 
  
Whoever performs is going to get 
the nod. 
It’s a simple philosophy laid out 
by Walton. A philosophy that Rog-ers is sure to have had heard at this point. 
Loud and clear.There is a fine line between split-
ting starts with other pitchers and losing your job altogether. In order for Rogers to maintain her balancing act, she must simply perform well when given the call. 
“It motivates me to work harder,” 
Rogers said. “Obviously they are re-ally good pitchers. So it motivates me — a lot.”
Rogers cannot coast on last year’s 
success to maintain her No. 1 role this year. Instead, she must take the wheel and drive the Gators to the promised land of a national cham-pionship behind the strength of her arm.
If not, Rogers won’t be checking 
her rearview mirror for very long.

  Two construction projects re-
placing pipes buried under UF’s 
campus are almost complete.
  The sites behind the Hub and 
in front of the Inﬁ  rmary will be restored in the next few weeks.
  Each project cost about 
$200,000, said Jeff Bair, project manager at the Architecture and Engineering Department of UF’s Physical Plant Division.  Both areas underwent con-
struction for steam distribution system problems. 
The pipes provide campus 
with steam for utilities including heating and hot water.
  Bair said problems are not un-
usual for the almost 30-year-old pipes.
  Two months ago at the Hub, 
workers found leaks were blow-ing 200-degree water out of a pipe that supplies steam power to the building. 
They found other pipes in bad 
condition, he said.
  Workers including contractors 
from Underground Services Inc. and W. W. Gay Mechanical Con-tractor Inc. had to cut out and re-place pipes.
  At the Inﬁ  rmary, workers 
knew the steam line was leaking but not that it was in a similar state.
  “We ended up virtually dou-
bling the level of work,” Bair said.
  The project began in January 
and took about two and a half weeks. 
Soon, workers will put the 
pipes in service, which means temporarily stopping hot water in nearby buildings, including some dorms and the Student Rec-reation Center, Bair said.
  “We do our best to make it as 
least inconvenient as possible,” he said.
  Ciara Lepanto, an 18-year-old 
English freshman, said she wasn’t impacted by the construction.
  “It’s just like, ‘Oh, OK, they’re 
blocking stuff off,’” she said. “It hasn’t bothered me yet.”

  At least one of two people charged in the Jan-

could face the death penalty.
  A grand jury indicted Maranda J. Martin, 22, 
of Fort White, and her cousin, Austin M. Jones, 22, of Mulberry, on eight counts Wednesday, including ﬁ  rst-degree murder, kidnapping and home-invasion robbery. Jones was also indicted for attempting to elude police and carrying a concealed ﬁ  rearm.
  State Attorney Bill Cervone will seek the 
death penalty for Jones, spokesman Spencer Mann said Thursday. Cervone has not decided whether to pursue the death penalty for Martin because he has not ﬁ  nished reviewing her case.
  Before making a decision, Cervone will con-
sider how violent Martin was during the rob-bery, her past criminal record and her mental state, among other elements, Mann said.

Students work out in Southwest Recreational Center on Thursday afternoon.  The gym was one of nine 
recognized by the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association as an outstanding sports facility.
� IT WAS ONE OF NINE       
FACILITIES RECOGNIZED WITH THE AWARD.

Alligator Staff Writer
Southwest Recreation Center’s 
$16.3 million renovation paid off 
with an award last month.
The gym was named one of nine 
outstanding sports facilities for 2012 by the National Intramural-Recre-ational Sports Association.
The renovation to Southwest 
Rec, which added 40,000 square feet to the center, was completed in Aug. 2010. Judges evaluated the fa-cility in seven categories, including architectural design, sustainability, technology and how well it meets its purpose.
Lexi Chaput, assistant chair of this year’s judging committee for NIRSA, said two things that stood out the most about Southwest Rec were its use of technology and the gym’s aesthetic features, such as the alligator skin on some interior win-dows and graphics on the walls.
Victoria Waltrip, a 22-year-old 
biology senior, said she loves the changes that came with the renova-tion — especially those made to the cardio machines, which she uses most often.
“I really like how everything is 
very spaced out,” she said. “You get a great variety.”
The eight other universities who 
received the award for athletic fa-cilities included Adelphi University; Ball State University; California State University , Long Beach; Colorado State University; Illinois State Uni-versity; Morehead State University; Oregon State University; and Vir -
ginia Commonwealth University.Southwest Rec named

Due to redistricting in Florida, a 
U.S. representative and a state sen-
ator will likely go head-to-head for the congressional seat of the newly drawn district encompassing UF.
U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Ocala, 
announced Wednesday he will seek a congressional seat in District 3 instead of District 11 because that is where most of his constituents now live.
Stearns will likely run against 
Florida Sen. Steve Oelrich, R-Cross Creek, for the District 3 congressio-nal seat.
Oelrich is a former Alachua 
County sheriff and has filed to run for the District 3 congressional seat.
Because 70 percent of the popu-
lation that helped petition to get him on the 2012 ballot now live in District 3, Stearns said in a press release, he felt he understands the needs and concern of its residents.
The newly drawn 3rd Congres-
sional District includes most of Ala-chua County, which is also the only county entirely based in Oelrich’s current legislative district.
Stearns said the new District 3 
includes most of the eight counties he currently represents, as well as his Gainesville and Orange Park district offices.
Oelrich was unavailable for 
comment because he was in a leg-islative session.The newly drawn congressional 
districts were approved by the Flor -
ida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate, said Katie Betta, spokeswoman for the Speaker of the Florida House of Representa-tives.
Gov. Rick Scott will have seven 
days to approve the new districts, Betta said.

UF’s Get Carded campaign aims 
to give students a chance to be heroes 
when they get their Gator 1 Cards at Preview.
Soon, UF students, faculty and staff 
may be able to register as organ and tissue donors during Gator 1 registra-tion.
Get Carded with Gator 1 is a proj-
ect of Get Carded, a student-run pub-lic relations campaign founded in 2002 that raises organ and tissue donation awareness.
“We’re not begging people to sign 
up to donate organs,” said Ronia Sil-mi, treasurer of Get Carded. “We want to inform people and raise awareness about this issue. People signing up is a bonus.”
The Get Carded with Gator 1 cam-
paign is still in the planning stages.
To get it off the ground, members 
will begin a petition asking for student support.
Eventually, they want to show a 
film about the benefits of becoming an organ donor at Preview.
Marigold Mikulski, a nursing soph-
omore, said she signed up to be an organ donor at 16, when she got her driver’s license.
“I think it’s a good idea because 
teenagers don’t think about the issue fully at the DMV ,” Mikulski said. “But later in college, they have thought about the issue more and it’s an easy way to sign up.”Group promotes organ donationon campus

About 1,600 students will gather to swap 
innovative ideas and listen to inspiring 18-
minute lectures on Saturday at UF’s third annual TEDx conference.
The conference, which is the largest 
TEDx event on the eastern seaboard, is Sat-urday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. 
This year’s theme is “Celebrating Curi-
osity.”
TEDxUF is an independently organized 
arm of the international nonprofit organi-zation TED, short for “Technology, Enter -
tainment and Design.” 
TED hosts global conferences centered 
on sharing “ideas worth spreading,” ac-cording to its website.
The conference is free, but reserve tick-
ets are no longer available.TEDxUF curator Ben Erez said videos 
of the lectures will be posted on the event website following the presentation.
Erez asks attendees to “think of TEDxUF 
as a retreat with your smartest friends.” 
The conference will host 12 speakers, 
ranging from entrepreneurs and journalists to professors and visionaries.
All of them will give free presentations 
lasting fewer than 18 minutes, as dictated by international TED guidelines.
“Even though it’s not a paid appearance, 
speakers have been excited about the op-portunity and more than willing to attend,” Erez said. “They know that a good idea that isn’t shared with others isn’t worth much.”TEDx conference kicks off Saturday

  The grams include a poem, a mes-
sage and two cookies. Recipients will receive a text to pick up their cookie grams at the Colonnade on Tuesday. A package for family members is also available this year.
  Club members will table at the 
Colonnade every weekday until Tuesday from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
  Students with animals on their 
minds can attend a vegan meal with Student Animal Alliance.
  The UF-based group, which in-
cludes non-student activists, is hold-ing a Very Vegan Valentine Dinner at the Civic Media Center on Saturday from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. A $5 donation is suggested.
  This is the ﬁ  rst time the group will 
be hosting the dinner, according to Civic Media Center coordinator Rob-bie Czopek, 28.
  “Having a vegan meal is a more 
welcoming and all-encompassing thing than one with meat,” Czopek said.
  The idea came from the group’s 
Thanksgiving meal, which he said at-tracted about 50 people.
  Music lovers can have Phi Mu 
Alpha music fraternity brothers ser-enade any valentine in Gainesville.
  The $35 package ($45 for non-UF 
students) includes three songs and a rose, according to the chapter’s mu-sic director and 21-year-old UF music education senior David Santiago.
  Santiago said he expects about 25 
to 30 serenades to be purchased this year.
  “The best part is singing with all 
the brothers,” he said. “We carpool from place to place so we get to spend a lot of bonding time together.”
  The proceeds will be given away 
for the ﬁ  rst time to an undetermined philanthropic cause.

For introducing a bill that we hope will prevent the 
indefinite detention of American citizens, we give a let’s-hope-this-passes LAUREL to the sponsors of H.R. 3676.
The bill amends the language of the National Defense 
Authorization Act to ensure that the language of the origi-nal law cannot be construed to allow the indefinite deten-tion of American citizens.
In reference to a story we ran Wednesday, we toss a 
what-a-bunch-of-creepy-perverts DART to the 21 men 
who were arrested in a child-sex sting.
However, we reserved special recognition for the win-
ner of our way-to-not-read-the-news SUPER DART: per -
vert No. 22, Richard Jernigan. 
This guy showed up a day after the press conference 
about the sting operation and still got arrested.
Next, we give a now-if-only-this-would-apply-to-the-

the requirements of No Child Left Behind for Florida and nine other states on Thursday. 
This is definitely a step in the right direction.As much as we hate to keep repeating ourselves, we just 
have to throw another it’s-so-ridiculous-it’s-funny DART  
at Toni Megna, the UF Student Government Supervisor of 
Elections.
As part of the election code revisions, the supervisor has 
to give a presentation to the Senate, outlining a contingen-cy plan for the SG elections in case anything goes wrong.
Well, according to her presentation, it would be impos-
sible to have secure secondary polling locations. 
The best part was that she didn’t take any questions 
during her presentation.
What a joke.Finally, for respecting the dignity of all human beings, 
we give a who-would-have-thought-that-this-would-still-be-going-on-in-2012 LAUREL to the U.S. Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals, which struck down Proposition 8, the ban on same-sex marriage in California.
Those who argue that this ruling thwarts the will of the 
people should realize that the majority does not rule in America.

next week!Assisted suicide not government’s business
It’s the reason George killed Lennie: He wanted to put Lennie out of his misery before the ranch hands could torture him.
Mercy is something we’re taught, some of us through 
religion and some through real experience. I was devas-tated when my first dog was euthanized, but I came to realize it was the humane choice because he had broken his back and was in constant pain.
In certain cases, I do think euthanasia for humans is the 
hard-but-right choice to make. According to a 2007 Gallup Poll, 71 percent of Americans support euthanasia for ter -
minally ill patients and 27 percent oppose such measures. Those decisions should be left to families; government should play as minor a role as possible in the right to die.
Doctor-assisted suicide occurs when a terminally ill 
patient seeks a physician to grant access to lethal sub-stances that the patient can take on his own. Conversely, euthanasia occurs when the doctor administers the lethal dose to the patient.
There may be cases when doctor-assisted suicide or 
euthanasia is the right choice. If a patient is facing pancre-atic cancer, just wilting away, and loses all the happiness of life to constant agony, doctor-assisted death may be a legitimate option. The government ought not to take that option off the table.
Christianity is decidedly against assisted suicide. Ac-
cording to a National Catholic Bioethics Center article, “Human life is an inviolable gift from God. Our love of God and His creation should cause us to shun any thought of violating this great gift through suicide or eu-thanasia.”
The Catholic Church’s position on this issue is nonsen-
sical and I vehemently disagree with it. I own my body. In a free society, you should be able to do whatever you wish with your body.
Some may smoke “death sticks,” but we do not restrict 
them because cigarettes are deleterious to your health and their usage conflicts with our personal morality or reli-gion. Instead we allow people to make their own decisions and deal with the self-inflicted consequences, whether they are good or bad.
It’s not the role of govern-
ment to protect us from our -
selves by limiting freedoms. The 
government should have no authority to deny voluntary consumption of any substances, and doctor-assisted sui-cide fits under that umbrella.
I’m not saying everyone with cancer should be eutha-
nized, but I am saying it should be legal for people to so-licit doctors to perform life-ending procedures with the utmost respect. Life is valuable, but is it worth living in a constant state of misery and discontent?
On Monday, the Georgia Supreme Court declared a 
1994 law that criminalized the public advertisement of assisted suicide unconstitutional, a victory for right-to-die supporters and a possible sign of where the debate is heading. Currently, only three states — Washington, Montana and Oregon — allow assisted suicide. The scar -
city of such services has promoted “death tourism” to Switzerland, the only place in the world where anyone, regardless of residency, can go for assisted suicide.
The right to die is a morbid topic that turns people’s 
stomachs. The right to life necessitates a right to death. What would life be without death?
The entire debate is part of a larger issue: Who decides 
liberty and who decides morality? The answer to both questions is the same: the individual.
Let people do what their hearts desire so long as they 
don’t breach the life, liberty or property of someone else.

Thursday’s photo was inappropriate
I was highly offended by the picture in the 
Alligator today of the young man arrested for 
theft. I would appreciate photos to be more informative and less sensational. To publish a picture of a suspect in the middle of a strip search before he’s even been proven guilty is in very bad taste. It didn’t add anything to the story and violated this 17-year-old’s privacy.
Please consider taking the photo that is 
published online down from the site.
A Concerned Reader
§ § §
Thursday’s photo unnecessary invasion of 
privacy
The photograph of the young man accused 
of robbery on the cover of the Alligator is de-humanizing and completely unnecessary.
It is a duty and a responsibility of the Alliga-
tor to relay the news for the safety and security 
of our students and for a better understanding of events like these on campus, but to plaster the photograph of an individual, cuffed, in only his underwear, being strip-searched by the police is a gross violation of an individual’s rights and privacy.
The image frames the accused as a specta-
cle and as an object to be gawked at. A simple story would have been enough, and I think there needs to be consideration to take the im-age down.
If an image is really necessary , then take a 
photograph of the cuffs being placed on the suspect’s wrists or of him being slid into the back of a car. But to have a young man sitting in his boxer shorts with his pants around his ankles as he is being strip-searched is going beyond a “strong photo” and crossing into the territory of violating an individual’s rights.
While I am not arguing in defense of his ac-
tions, the repercussions of his criminal offense do not include being treated as an animal and photographed as a creature in a zoo without clothes.
He, like any other human being, is entitled 
to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty in a court of law. Following the latter, he should then be treated with due process, but that does not excuse the subjugation of an individual at a very basic human level.
I feel, if anything, the photograph should be 
a commentary on the poor procedure of Uni-versity Police rather than demonization of this young man. The newspaper has agency and is responsible for running the photograph.A photo is meant to provide insight into the 
story that is provided alongside it. The image illuminates the glaring faults of UPD in the manner in which this situation was handled. The article itself does not discuss the injustices of the situation; if it did, the photograph would be appropriate.
The story paired with the image discuss-
es the crime and only the crime. The image paired, in this case, with this article becomes a violation and a perpetuation of thought pro-cesses and ideologies that are misplaced.
It is unnecessary, it is inflammatory and in 
that regard, the Alligator is responsible. The manner in which you frame media is very important, and I think in this instance, it was framed poorly.

America’s political parties are infamous for their in-
ability to agree on anything. So when both sides of the political spectrum sue you, you’re probably 
screwed.
The right-wing Second Amendment Foundation teamed 
up with the left-wing First Amendment Foundation to sue the Eastern Washington library system, which covers the Chelan, Douglas and Okanogan counties, for censoring women’s gun-owner websites and magazines, according to The Seattle Times.
What started as the mere censorship of pornographic ma-
terial on Web pages has blown into a fight about how far a library system can go in controlling material children may be exposed to.
After blocking pornographic websites, the Eastern Wash-
ington library system started regulating the availability of magazines and websites featuring gun usage and drug and alcohol references, according to The Seattle Times.
On the other hand, the Seattle Public Library system has 
been known to allow patrons to watch hard-core pornograph-ic material in its libraries despite the presence of children.
Both of these are extremes, but the restriction of informa-tion would be a darker reality than the danger of corrupting the youth of America.
Dictators realize the value of books 
— many hold book-burnings when a 
new regime rises to power. In order to suppress the populace, they must control the flow of free thought. Ability to think independently leads to the realization that a few remain priv-ileged over the despondency of the many. Thus, educated minds are the bane of a tyrant’s grasp on power.
Despite the fact that we live in a democracy, this remains 
applicable because the loss of access to different opinions shows changes in political climate. However, the restriction of pornographic material does not endanger society unless the human race forgets how to reproduce.
Not so long ago, many books were banned in U.S., in-
cluding “The Canterbury Tales.” According to Cornell Law School, they justified this by using the Hicklin’s law, an Eng-lish law that stated any speech intended to corrupt the minds of those who were open to it could be banned. This allowed for the banning of practically everything.
In more recent times, the Supreme Court used the test cre-ated by the Burger court in Miller v. California and derived from the Warren court in Roth v. United States. The Supreme Court’s ruling asked whether the material could be seen as obscene and affects sensitive members of society — specifi-cally, children.
Clearly pornographic material can be classified as obscene 
and children will possibly be exposed to such material unless public libraries designate a particular area for adults 18 and older.
The library systems should not run on the same principles 
as the local movie store with access to an R-rated section. However, gun magazines do not count as obscenity. One of the websites the library blocked features photos of women shooting guns who are fully clothed, of every age and not posed or altered in any form to appear sensual.
I believe in access to gun websites and the freedom of 
information for the same reason that I do not think that the Second Amendment should ever be overturned by Congress or the Supreme Court. People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people.

On the evening of Jan. 9, 
Jones and Martin wore masks and broke into Paul Quandt’s house at 4854 NW 75th Road, according to an arrest report. Martin used to work for a company that provided home aid for Quandt. She knew he owned a safe.
Martin and Jones brought 
two rolls of tape, a stun gun and a pair of pistols, accord-ing to police. When Quandt refused to provide the com-bination of the safe, he was beaten, shot with the stun gun and bound at the hands with tape.
Martin and Jones put 
Quandt’s safe into his white 2001 Cadillac DeVille. They stole jewelry, guns, electron-ics, watches, coins, credit cards, alcohol, medication and other goods, according to the grand jury indictment.
After they left, Quandt, a

Wrecked Wall
Graffiti marks the wall in front of a house on University Avenue on Thursday.  In response to increased 
amounts of graffiti, spokesman Bob Woods said the city has developed a campaign to raise public awareness about the issue that will be unrolled this month. Read the story on alligator.org.
About 20 officers participated in Operation Tailfeather
ally they agreed to meet Wednes-
day. The day before, during the press conference, ASO Sgt. Todd Kelly was asked whether going public with the sex sting would curb the department’s chances of snagging other child predators.  
“There’s plenty of folks out 
there that are willing to travel to have sex with a child, unfortu-nately,” Kelly said.
Sure enough, Jernigan drove 
to the airport, where officers ar -rested him.
Throughout Tuesday’s press 
conference, law enforcement of-ficials repeated that they weren’t finished with Operation Tail-feather. 
Still, they didn’t expect to 
catch other alleged predators. They were just expecting to pre-pare cases to submit to a federal prosecutor.
After dedicating more than 20 
officers from the sheriff’s office to the operation last week, only four or five detectives who investigate predators full-time remain on the detail, Forgey said. 
They don’t predict any more 
arrests.
“I imagine that’s going to be 
the last one we get,” Forgey said. “We don’t expect too many other people to be unaware of the op-eration.”

� CITY COMMISSION GAVE 
GPD $15,000 TO BUY DOGS.
ADRIANNA PAIDAS
Alligator Writer
Gainesville Police officers will 
head to North Carolina in two 
weeks to recruit new four-legged deputies.
The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment K-9 Unit is on the lookout for two additions to its squad. Old age is starting to take a toll on Redd, 8, and Justice, 7, the two oldest European Shepherds in the unit.
After the Gainesville City 
Commission ap-
proved funding to GPD to buy the dogs, the officers began their search. The commis-sion gave GPD $15,000 to buy 
the canines.
“These dogs are essentially 
sworn-in officers,” said Commis-sioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa. “We want to do whatever we can to support the police department.”
Sgt. John Franklin, supervisor 
of the K-9 Unit, said a popular vendor in North Carolina is go-ing to Germany on Wednesday to bring back young German Shepherds, which are identical to European Shepherds. Franklin hopes to purchase two promising pups.
The cost of an untrained Ger -
man Shepherd used for law en-forcement ranges from $6,500 to $8,000, he said. Though expen-sive, shepherds in Europe are known for their strength.
“The main ingredient when we 
look for dogs is their play drive,” he said. “If they want to play a lot, then we know they will be good to train.”
Once a dog is picked, it is 
paired with a handler. The two must go through 400 hours of training before they are certified and able to start patrolling.During the first two weeks, 
the handler and the dog focus on bonding and obedience training. Then rigorous training begins where the dogs work on follow-ing scents in different environ-ments, Franklin said.
Officer Jeffrey Kerkau, 31, has 
been waiting to get his canine partner since mid-December when he was chosen to be a han-dler.
In order for an officer to be 
a handler, he or she must have at least two years of experience as a police officer and be in tip-top physical condition, Franklin said.
“My career goal was to be a 
handler,” Kerkau said. “You get to go where all the action is.”  
The K-9 Unit, which consists 
of six teams of handlers and dogs, deals with everything from chasing suspects to sniffing out narcotics.
Kerkau said he and his girl-
friend, whom he lives with, are looking forward to having the shepherd in their home. The two want to name the dog Arkham, the name of a fictional city in a story they read online.
“I just have to make sure I es-
tablish myself as the alpha dog,” he said. “That way he knows who’s boss.” FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 9

Florida freshman guard Brad Beal scored nine points and committed five turnovers in a loss to Tennessee in January and said the Gators must be more aggressive Saturday. 
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
 
As Kentucky’s lead swelled in Rupp Are-
na and Florida’s missed shots mounted, Brad 
Beal could feel the disunity building on the court.
His teammates were not just falling be-
hind in a critical Southeastern Conference game on Tuesday, they were also losing touch with one another. 
“You could see it in other guys’ faces,” 
Beal said. 
“You have guys who are like afraid of 
missing shots, so they won’t take another shot or they’re so worried about the shot not going in that we all forget about the rest of the game on defense and rebounding and getting back in transition.”
A frequent concern for the three-heavy 
Gators this season is how they react when their shots aren’t falling. 
Along with a 5.7 percent drop in 3-point 
shooting, UF has been out-rebounded 177-176 and is averaging 15.6 turnovers per game in its five losses.
With just two days to prepare for a second 
meeting against Tennessee (12-12, 4-5 SEC) on Saturday at 4 p.m. — a team No. 8 Florida (19-5, 7-2 SEC) lost to by 11 points on Jan. 7 — coach Billy Donovan is imploring, once again, for his team to have a short memory.
“We went into the (Kentucky) game with 
fractured minds,” Donovan said. 
“And what I mean by that is nothing to 
do with adversity or anything else, I think we went in there where each guy wanted to do his part and to play well, and what hap-pened is you’re playing the game as a group of individuals.”
Though Beal said the Gators’ 41 misses 
from the field clearly affected their focus, he  doesn’t think the 20-point drubbing UF expe-rienced in Lexington, Ky., will carry over into this weekend. Florida has yet to lose back-to-back games this season and is 14-0 in true home games.
On an individual level, Beal, a 6-foot-3 
guard, learned firsthand how to bounce back from a miserable performance following the Gators’ first matchup with the Volunteers.
“That’s our biggest issue: our mental ap-
proach to the game,” Beal said. 
“Basically, and not being able to move 
past adversity and trying to fight through it.”
Heading into January’s road trip to Knox-
ville, Tenn., Beal was mired in a four-game freshman slump that culminated with him going 4 for 12 from the field, 1 of 5 on 3-point-ers and committing five turnovers to one as-sist against Tennessee.
Three days later while hosting Georgia, he 
bounced back by scoring 17 points on 4-of-8 shooting and hauling in 10 rebounds. Beal also had just one giveaway. 
“Yeah, [the Tennessee loss is] in the back 
of our mind right now,” Beal said. “We’re going  to move on, we have to come out more aggressive than we did. Tennessee really put the throttle on us and just really hurt us down UF working on ‘fractured minds’

The redshirt senior forward’s three-

“We just came out with energy and 
intensity,” Madu said. “We just can’t get comfortable. We’ve got to keep wanting more.” 
UF’s post-halftime offensive on-

The Tigers were much more competi-
tive in the first half, besting the Gators in field goal percentage, 3-point percentage and rebounding.
However, Florida employed the full-
court press to great effect against Au-burn.
The Gators forced 13 Tigers turnovers 
in the game’s first 20 minutes, scoring 15 points off those giveaways en route to a 36-31 halftime lead.
Auburn’s struggles taking care of the 
ball continued into the second half and proved to be too much to overcome.

Daniel Pigott is looking forward to track-
ing down line drives to left field this season 
without the threat of clanking into a chain-link fence. 
With a new padded outfield wall being 
one of the offseason renovations to McKethan Stadium, Florida’s three senior outfielders will have an added comfort they have seen in other Southeastern Conference parks for years. But after watching Pigott for three sea-sons, Gators coach Kevin O’Sullivan doesn’t believe it makes that much of a difference to his left fielder. 
“I don’t think it’s changed his approach,” 
O’Sullivan said. “If it was a brick wall, I think he’d probably give it his best effort.”
These comments aren’t uncommon for 
Florida’s coach when he talks about Pigott. In 2011, the left fielder from Ormond Beach  raised his batting average to .331 from a .268 clip the previous season and stole a team-high 15 bases on 19 attempts. After watching Pigott go undrafted in June, O’Sullivan said he knows how important the senior will be to this season’s national championship aspi-rations. 
“He’s going to have a 
big year, and he needs to for us to be as good as we want to be,” O’Sullivan said. 
Offensively , Pigott 
could be poised to have 
his best season yet. When discussing this year’s bat-ting lineup, Pigott talks 
about a group of players hardened by expe-riencing multiple trips to the College World Series. He knows that his own approach has improved by being thrown into an array of big moments, and he sees it in his teammates as well. Gators relying on senior Pigott

The Gators’ lineup did not look like it 
would have room for newcomers.
Florida returned 11 of 12 starters from 
a team that made it to the quarterfinals 
in the NCAA Tournament in 2011, but the Gators’ freshmen have found a way to earn minutes on a team with several accomplished upperclassmen.
Midfielders Nicole Graziano, Nora 
Barry, Shannon Gilroy and defender Sally Jentis are all expected to see signif-icant playing time in Florida’s regular-season opener Saturday in Chapel Hill, N.C., against North Carolina.
“Our freshmen, from the moment 
they stepped on campus, made a name for themselves,” Gators coach Amanda O’Leary said. “Having them through the fall, watching them mature, watching them learn, and they just fit in flawlessly with our team.”
As the nation’s third-best recruiting, 
class according to Inside Lacrosse mag-azine, the freshmen were aware they were committing to a young program returning all of its key pieces. However, O’Leary assured them the best players would play if they earned it in practice, regardless of class.
“We’re going to play the best players,” 
O’Leary said. “If they are all freshmen, then they are all freshmen. If they are all seniors, they’re all seniors. It’s going to be the 12 people who give us the best op-portunities to win lacrosse games.”
The freshmen made the most of their 
first opportunity in UF’s 17-2 win exhibi-tion win against England on Jan. 26, as Graziano scored four goals while Barry added two.
Graziano credits her upperclassman 
teammates for help adjusting to the speed of the college game and making a seamless transition into the Gators’ lineup.
“There is not one person who hasn’t 
helped me,” Graziano said. “Either off the field pulled me aside to teach me the plays again or on the field.”
While the December transfer of ju-
nior midfielder Janine Hillier opened up a spot in the midfield, Florida returned 
its entire defense from 
2011. That has not pre-vented Jentis, who started against Eng-land, from earning her fair share of playing time.
“[Jentis is] really 
quick,” O’Leary said. 
“She can cover a large amount of space in a short amount of time. She has great instincts, so she can intercept a lot of balls.”
O’Leary said Jentis will also see time 
in the midfield.
Junior attacker Kitty Cullen, who 
scored 77 goals in 2011 as part of an al-ready potent attack, said the firepower the freshman class provides will make the Gators’ offense impossible to con-tain.
“They’re going to have to try, but 
they’re definitely not going to be able to because each and every single person out there can take it to goal and score.”Freshmen earn playing time for season opener against UNC FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 15

in league play,” Butler said. “It just makes it harder to scout Florida if you’re not sure who you’ve really got to clue in on.”
The Gators won their third 
straight game by defeating the Tigers, notching their second con-secutive victory by double digits.
Florida has 
not racked up 
three wins in a row since down-ing Charles-ton Southern, Duquesne and Samford in late December.
“Our seniors 
are doing a great job of leading and showing how important each one of those moments are,” Butler said. “Winning the three games in a row is because we’ve been pre-paring with a sense of urgency, not just playing with a sense of urgency.”
Thursday’s game marked 
the sixth conference win for the Gators, putting them above .500 in SEC play for the first time this season.
Florida is now four games be-
hind Kentucky in the league stand-ings with five contests left to play.
“It’s February, this is where 
you have to buckle down and ev-erybody’s stepping up their game individually and also collectively as a team,” Allen said. “With all of us being confident, that works in our favor.”

the stretch, as well.”
While the Volunteers have 
added a new player to their 
roster since the Gators last played them in freshman for-ward Jarnell Stokes, who is averaging 8.9 points and 7.9 rebounds per game, Donovan said the familiarity with Ten-nessee’s methodical offense and physical defense will help Florida on Saturday.
The Volunteers’ frontline 
dominated the Gators in the paint with a 32-20 advantage, while also grabbing four more defensive rebounds.
“I don’t think that going 
into the game they’re not go-ing to necessarily be ready to play,” Donovan said. “I don’t feel that way. I think they’ll come out and they’ll battle and they’ll fight and try to make corrections from our last game and try to make cor-rections from the last time we played Tennessee.”

Pigott motivated by last year
Pigott went on a tear to end the 
2011 season. He batted .389 with 
16 runs and 10 RBI in Florida’s 16 postseason matchups, including a 2-for-4 mark in the victory against Vanderbilt that sent the Gators to the College World Series finals. 
“He epitomizes everything we 
look for in a player;” O’Sullivan said. “He just kind of does his thing.”
As a senior, Pigott doesn’t jump 
into leadership bravado as much as others. But he said he has helped freshmen like outfielder Cory Reid adjust to the pressures of playing for No. 1 Florida.
Pigott has admitted he was dis-
appointed when he was not draft-ed in 2011, and now the opportu-nity of a final season in Gainesville has snuck up on him. 
“Everybody tells you it goes by 
real quick, but then all of a sudden it catches up,” he said. “So yeah, it’s kinda crazy.”
After seeing the SEC for three 
years, Pigott’s preparation for a new opponent in 2012 reverts back to the padded wall. While it gives McKethan Stadium an added look of professionalism, it also gives UF outfielders something to adjust to. 
“It’s got a little more bounce 
to it, but we’ve been working on that,” Pigott said. “By the time the season comes around, we’ll know it like the back of our hand.”BAseBALL , from page 14

After spending his first two years of 
college at Wake Forest, Frank Carleton 
wanted the opportunity to play for an elite tennis program. One month into his first dual-match season in Gainesville, he has made the most of that opportunity.
The junior, who is undefeated in singles 
play during dual matches, has been a ma-jor factor in the No. 5 Gators’ strong start to the season. He will put his perfect record on the line Saturday when Florida hosts No. 32 Florida State.
“I’m always trying to get better,” Carle-
ton said. “I feel like I’m getting better every time I’m on the court. I can get a lot bet-ter.”
Carleton joined the Gators in August 
after struggling through his sophomore year at Wake Forest. When he went 13-20 in singles play, Carleton made the decision to transfer. 
He has been ranked as high as 20th na-
tionally in singles, but never quite saw sig-nificant success aside from being named to the All-Atlantic Coast Conference team his freshman year. 
When Carleton arrived in Gainesville, 
he was welcomed with open arms. Coach Andy Jackson made sure Carleton under -
stood he would be playing in a great envi-ronment.“‘It’s good to be a Gator.’ That was the 
first thing [Jackson] said to me, and that was the first thing I remember,” Carleton said. “That’s been probably the most true 
statement that I’ve found out here.
“Playing for the Gators 
is really professional. You have a lot of things at your fingertips, all the resourc-
es you could imagine. Ev-erybody really wants to win here.“
Carleton has thrived off the competi-
tion thus far. After going 7-3 in singles play during the fall, he has reeled off three straight wins to start the dual-match sea-son. His latest win came last Saturday against Virginia’s Alex Domijan, who has been ranked as high as No. 1 nationally. Carleton has also played well in doubles, as he and partner Spencer Newman are 14-3 since the fall, including 4-0 during the dual-match season.
“Me and Spence complement each other 
pretty well,” he said. “We used to be room-mates at the USTA academy a few years back. Our friendship off the court might be carrying over on the court and vice versa.”
Almost six months into his career at 
Florida, Carleton has settled in. He is play-ing tennis at a high level on an elite team, something he wanted badly when he came to Gainesville.
“It’s a big-time program. It’s a winning 
program, not a program that would be sat-isfied with a 20-in-the nation spot. So we’re trying to win, and that’s what I like.”

Underdog is not often heard 
when describing Florida, espe-
cially with a home-field advan-tage. 
However, when the Gators 
host the SunTrust Gator Invita-tional on Saturday, that’s exactly what they will be. 
The field for this weekend will 
consist of highly ranked teams such as No. 9 Arkansas, No. 2 Auburn, No. 20 Florida State, No. 19 Central Florida and No. 12 North Florida — none of which will allow Florida to walk away with an easy win like it has done in years past. 
“I don’t think that there’s any question from a rankings stand-point, we are definitely under -
dogs,” coach Buddy Alexander said. 
Although they aren’t on top of 
the rankings, the Gators aren’t let-ting that affect their confidence. 
“I’m not too concerned with 
rankings, I’m just trying to have my team ready to play and we’re just trying to get better every day,” Alexander said. “I know if we play well, we’ll be hard to beat.”
Junior T.J. Vogel, who hopes to 
grab his second win of the season this weekend at the Gators’ home course, is also confident in his game and the rest of his team. 
Vogel said he views his team-
mates, specifically junior Tyler McCumber, as some of his big-gest competition in the tourna-ment.
Florida has won the past eight 
Gator Invitationals, and it has been a while since highly ranked teams like Arkansas have come to play in the tournament. 
“Maybe those guys are here 
because they knew that this was a rebuilding year and they’re anxious to end our streak,” Alex-ander said. “I’m just happy to have them 
come to town and (I am) looking forward to this year’s invitation-al, which should be one of our best in quite a while.” 
Besides facing new competi-
tion at the tournament this week-end, the Gators will also be field-ing a new player, Zach Lee. 
Lee, who was referred to as 
the team’s mystery player by Al-exander during a Monday press conference, is a redshirt senior who transferred to Florida from Furman.   
According to Alexander, he 
has been playing well and there-fore will be competing as part of the team this weekend. 
The newcomer will join Vogel, 
McCumber and freshman Eric Banks in Florida’s lineup, but the final spot is still up for grabs. 
Junior Tommy Mou,  fresh-
man Thomas Stewart and senior Michael Furci are playing in practice to determine who will take the fifth spot in the weekend rotation. 
The other two will still com-
pete as individuals.. 
“I have confidence in my 
team,” Alexander said. “I know we have advantages playing here.”
“Whether or not our good is 
good enough to keep up with somebody else’s good remains to be seen. 
But on our home golf course, 
I think our good will be pretty competitive.”
