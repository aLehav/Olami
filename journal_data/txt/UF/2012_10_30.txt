Congressional candidates Ted 
Yoho, J.R. Gaillot and Phil Dodds 
spoke at Santa Fe College on Mon-day in a public information forum.
The forum started off with state-ments from each candidate about why he is running for U.S. Congress. The candidates then answered ques-tions, some of which were posed by audience members.
“The Democracy Commitment is 
all about exposing college students to ways that they can be better-informed citizens,” Marilyn Tubb, co-chair of the Democracy Commit-ment at Santa Fe, told attendees.
She said all three candidates 
bring new, fresh faces to congressio-nal politics, and the race is consid-ered the cleanest congressional race in the country.“I’m a no-party afﬁ  liate indepen-
dent running for Congress to restore trust and help solve our nation’s challenges,” Dodds said. “V oters are supposed to be the boss, and the representative is supposed to be the employee.”
Yoho said he’s running because 
he’s dissatisﬁ  ed with some current government decisions.
“I’ve had enough of Washington standing in the way of job creation, which is really important to you when you look at the job rate for col-lege graduates,” said the Republican candidate.
Topics covered during the forum 
included whether to keep the Elec-toral College the way it is, whether to raise the debt ceiling, what to do with former President George W.

◗ UF HAS THE 12TH BEST 
SAFE-SEX PROGRAM OF 200 SCHOOLS SURVEYED.

The birds and the bees have 
their place at UF.
UF ranked No.12 on a list of the 
top 25 schools with the best safe-
sex programs in a study released by The Daily Beast last week.
UF ranked No. 8 in 2011.Sperling’s Best Places and Tro-
jan Brand Condoms started the list seven years ago and compiled the information through surveys given to 200 college student-health centers and administrators, according to The Daily Beast.
Sex education programs are 
evaluated on the convenience, quality and scope of each service, according to the site.Student Health Care Center 
spokeswoman Catherine A. See-mann said she doesn’t know why UF would drop in the rankings, but it could be due to the study’s lack of knowledge on the college’s seasonal programs.
“Sex in the Swamp” is a whole 
week of sex education before Spring Break put on by national professional health education honor society Eta Sigma Gamma, which allows students to interact with one another on sex topics.
The SHCC also expanded its 
sexual health services, Seemann said.
The center now offers free 
STD testing for students on cam-pus with the help of the Alachua County Health Department.
The tests are limited in avail-
ability and only offered on week-day afternoons, she said.Gators still on top of

Gainesville Police identiﬁ  ed the victim of 
a West University Avenue homicide as part 
of new details released Monday.
Police named Robert L. Dockens, 60, of 
Gainesville, as the victim who died from a stab wound Friday, according to a GPD news release.
The suspect, Clifton Rae 
Baxter, 33, was arrested in connection with the homi-cide Saturday afternoon in Alabama.
During their investi-
gation, police found that Dockens and Baxter were acquaintances, and Baxter often traveled between Dothan, Ala., and Orlando to visit family.
Friday morning, the two men fought over 
money near the Bank of America in the 1000 block of West University Avenue.
The ﬁ  ght escalated when Baxter allegedly 
stabbed Dockens in the chest. 
Dockens ran away and later collapsed on Southwest 12th Street off West University Avenue, according to the release.
Moments later, Baxter drove his van up to 
Dockens and rummaged through his pock-ets, stealing his wallet. 
He then drove back to Dothan, police 
said.
At 5:23 a.m, GPD received a call from a Victim of West University homicide identified by police

◗ CARS RUN FROM     
CAMPUS EVERY HALF HOUR UNTIL 7:30 P.M. 
KELCEE GRIFFIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Early voting started Satur -
day , which for many students 
releases the time constraints of having to go to the polls Nov . 6. But it still doesn’t solve the is-sue of how to get there.
For those having trouble 
with transportation, Gators for Obama is providing shuttle ser -
vices from Turlington Plaza and the Reitz Union Colonnade.
Co-chairwoman Rachel 
McGovern, a 20-year-old politi-cal science junior, said cars run about every half hour until 7:30 p.m. each evening. She said students can schedule a ride by filling out a reservation ticket, but scheduling a ride isn’t re-quired.
Jenna Goldman, a 19-year-
old UF political science sopho-more, said she’s taking advan-tage of the service because she wants to avoid the Election Day rush, and the shuttle is the most convenient way to get there early.
“It’s going to be crazy on 
Tuesday ,” she said. “I’m not very good at taking buses. I don’t have a car, and it’s cold outside.”
While rides from campus 
can be handy , students aren’t the only ones in need of as-sistance getting to the polls, said Duane Gildea, chairman of events and services for the Alachua County Democratic Executive Committee.
“There are people who are 
limited in transportation for a number of different reasons,” Gildea said.
He said other organizations 
are targeting minority commu-nity areas and areas where pre-cincts have been moved farther away from neighborhoods.
He said some local funeral 
homes have even offered their limousines to help drive voters back and forth.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if 
I saw someone pulling a cart with people loaded on it to the polls,” Gildea said. “It’s at that level now.”
Associate political science 
professor Michael Scicchitano said particular parties — or organizations associated with them — offering shuttle servic-es shouldn’t affect participants’ decisions once they get inside the voting booth.
“They have the right to vote, 
and we’re just getting them there,” he said.
Sociology freshman Roc-
quel Bobson, 18, mirrored that mindset.
“It really doesn’t matter 
what bus you get in, as long as you vote,” she said. “Your vote is private. In the end, no one re-ally knows who you’re going to vote for.”Groups mobilize 
voters by rolling them to the polls
SOCIAL MEDIA

The last thing some students ex-
pect to be graded on is what they 
write in 140 characters or less, but it may be beneficial.
A Michigan State University 
study called “Twitteracy: Tweeting as a New Literary Practice,” found that students who tweet as part of their instruction are more engaged in the course content and have high-er grades.
“It’s interesting because Twitter 
is normally used in a social setting, and now we’re using it in class,” said Paige V erhoeven, 20-year-old English and psychology junior at UF about tweeting for her British Romanticism course.
UF social media specialist Bruce 
Floyd agreed that use of social me-dia in the classroom can be helpful to students.
“It’s also an easy medium for 
students to use because familiarity is there,” he said.
Floyd said UF’s administra-
tion was probably not aware of the study’s results, but many courses utilize Twitter as a teaching tool.
V erhoeven’s class is just one 
example. She said students are re-quired to tweet at least five times a week about subjects discussed in class. Each tweet should include the hashtag #britlit.
Hashtags can be used to compile 
all the tweets onto a single page, allowing users to view all at once, Floyd said.
UF journalism professor Dave 
Carlson said he believed tweeting is especially important for journalism students. He said through tweeting, students are practicing grabbing the reader’s attention.
Floyd agreed Twitter can help 
students learn to communicate ef-fectively.
“Tweeting is like texting,” he 
said. “It forces you to get to the point.” Study finds students who tweet 
through class are more engagedTUESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Vice President Joe Biden will speak in 
Ocala on Wednesday to encourage early 
voting and support for President Barack Obama in the upcoming election.
The outdoor event will take place at 
the Discovery Center at Tuscawilla Park. Doors will open at 1 p.m. Wednesday for ticket holders, according to a press release.
Free tickets can be picked up at the 
OFA-FL Northwest Gainesville Field Office, located at 2727 NW 43rd St., in Gainesville today from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. One ticket will be given per person on a first-come, first-served basis.
Obama for America office locations 
at 21 North Magnolia Ave. and 3327 E. Silver Springs Blvd. in Ocala, and at 15437 U.S. 441 in Summerfield will also be distributing tickets, according to the release.
Gators for Obama co-chairwoman Rachel McGovern said she thinks Biden’s visit will draw a “great” crowd.
“I know lots of students drove to 
UCF [Monday] to see President Obama, even though he didn’t speak — Bill Clin-ton did,” the 20-year-old political sci-ence junior said. “It shows that people are definitely willing to travel to see the president and vice president.”
This event follows a speech by vice-
presidential candidate Paul Ryan in Oc-ala on Oct. 18.
In addition, former President Bill 
Clinton appeared at the University of Central Florida on Monday . Obama was also due to appear but canceled in order to return to Washington, D.C., to prepare for a response to Hurricane Sandy.Joe Biden to speak in Ocalacampus

Twin brothers Brendan and Jeremy Smyth 
share nearly everything — from the same last 
name to the same DNA to the same passion for creating real-world documentaries.
To fulfill their latest project, the UF gradu-
ates need $8,000 by Nov. 20 to fund their new-est documentary, called “Rice for Sale.”
Brendan Smyth, 23, said he wants the film 
to depict the life of Balinese inhabitants who travel to the United States to earn money for their families.
“These people are flying across the world 
to fulfill their dream,” he said. “They had to basically run away and go to America because they can’t make enough money to support their family.”
Jeremy Smyth said showing personal ac-
counts of the native people will allow viewers to truly understand their culture.
“The worst thing for us to do is to make a 
movie saying tourism is bad and indigenous people are good because that’s not how they think,” he said. “They can only exist in the har -mony.”
Brendan Smyth said donations are submit-
ted through Kickstarter, “a website for starving artists.”
Jeremy Smyth said they asked for $8,000 
because he doesn’t think he and Brendan have enough influence on the world to receive more than that.
“I will drain my bank account for that mov-
ie,” he said.
And local film enthusiasts have taken notice 
of the brothers’ talents.
Roger Beebe, a UF film professor and owner 
of Video Rodeo, said despite the competi-tive market for independent filmmakers, the Smyths have a distinct style.
“Maybe them being twins and having two 
people keeps moving things forward,” he said. “I have faith in their ability to do this.”
Jeremy Smyth said he and his brother rarely 
become upset, but if they don’t raise enough money, that will change.
“If the Bali project is unfunded, we will face 
imminent depression,” he said. “This is the No. 1 priority in my life  — trying to fund this proj-ect. It is my No. 1 passion.”UF graduates raising money 
to fund latest documentary

Why does social media have to ruin everything?
Last week, we wrote an editorial about the hazards 
of going online during a presidential debate. Maybe 
all of the GIFs pose a potential threat to actually understanding 
what’s going on; by focusing on the viral capacity of a debate subject, we then start to ignore or forget what we’re actually de-bating.
It’s like all of us get so swept up into the awesome feeling 
of making a joke while it’s still relevant that we don’t even care about the actual issues. We could go into all of the issues that got passed over because of their fun catchphrases, but instead we’d like to point out another way that social media has failed us.
By now you’ve heard of the “Frankenstorm” that is Hurri-
cane Sandy plus an Arctic front plus a full moon, all on the week of Halloween.You might have even seen some pretty powerful images of storms ﬂ  oating around the Internet.
Only, they circulate almost every time there’s a major storm 
threatening anywhere. There are pretty much 11 really popular ones that are making the rounds this time.
Now, don’t let your attention drift away when we start talk-
ing about things “going viral” or what “memes” are or who made the “Internet.” What’s important to note here is the fact that we’re all pretty impressionable.
Just because something is on Twitter or shows up on your 
Facebook feed doesn’t mean that it’s true or relevant.
For example, David Ortiz tweeted a picture of what looked 
like the Statue of Liberty being engulfed by some major waves. Erin Andrews also posted it to her page. It seems they both be-lieved it was very, very true.
It was a still from the movie “The Day After Tomorrow.”Andrews seems to be laughing it off, but she’s pretty gullible 
for being a journalist.
Even on fun websites like Twitter, never believe anything is 
true unless it comes from a very valid source.
Another image that circulated early this week was a touching 
photo of soldiers guarding the Tomb of the Unknown. It shows three soldiers braving some rough weather conditions in order to continue their duty to the tomb.
The photo was taken during a storm in September, not dur-
ing Sandy. A meaningful sentiment, but it didn’t happen during Sandy.
We just want you to be careful. There’s no need to be duped 
by the Internet unless it’s truly necessary, and that is basically never.
Some of the images you can trust are probably being reported 
by high-quality news organizations, and they probably don’t look Photoshopped.
We can’t really teach you how to spot a good Photoshop job; 
it’s something you’re just born with. It has something to do with pixels.
Don’t let the crazy news stories distract or convince you. Just 
do an extra step of research if you think something is question-able. And if it feels like you’ve seen it before, then you probably did.Passing time is the essence of our lives
Taylor Swift released her fourth studio album,  
“Red,” last week. 
I remember merely knowing her as the young, 
curly-haired girl with icy blue eyes upon her debut six 
years ago.
Most critics are saying she has ﬁ  nally swayed away 
from being that young teenage girl. 
As a 22-year-old, she matured out of her adolescence 
and into adulthood.
Sometimes all it takes to see signiﬁ  cant change is a 
little bit of time.  
The passing of time is something I am learning to 
come to terms with. It’s hard to believe that moments 
of what seemed like yesterday actually happened years ago.
Time evolves and so do we. Our ideas and ways of 
life all change.
We reminisce on our childhoods as something from 
not too long ago. We can vividly recount our favorite television shows, movies, songs, clothes, gadgets and toys of the past.
At the time, it felt like we’d never get out of our 
youth. Years later, we call those some of the best days and vividly make nostalgic reference to them.
In a strange way, life comes full circle, and roles re-
verse. In the future — or even now — we ﬁ  nd ourselves taking care of a parent or grandparent who once helped take care of us.
We frantically remind ourselves that time is pass-
ing by too quickly or dragging on too slowly. We ques-tion time and what it does to us. The people and places around us change, often for what seems like the worse.
Time is a stress that has more power over us than we 
notice. It’s an inﬁ  nite journey that manages to control many of the decisions we make, as well as the actions we take.
Those seconds, minutes and hours often limit us. They convince us we’re not ca-pable of accomplishing what we desire to. They turn into days, weeks, months, years and then fade into memories.   
It feels like time is extremely 
limiting and limited.  
Time isn’t necessarily bad, 
however. 
It allows moments to pass so we can see the changes 
we hope for. We notice advances in ourselves and our society. Goals that seemed impossible to reach are at-tained, and dreams that once felt far-fetched come true. We do things we never could have seen ourselves do-ing; we see and experience things we never could have imagined.
The best thing about time is that you can rely on it 
and the change it will bring. There is always room for improvement or an opportunity to fulﬁ  ll a goal, dream or wish you’ve always had.
Life is full of so many unexpected qualities. Just 
when you think you’ve ﬁ  gured it out, believe that it will manage to take you by surprise. We will change. So will our circumstances, priorities and preferences.
Take advantage of your time. Dedicate it not only to 
yourself, but to others as well. Reﬂ  ect on the past. Live in the present. Always remember to look toward the fu-ture ahead of you.
Time doesn’t stop here — it never does. You may or 
may not believe in a life after the one you have now, but I encourage you to think about it.
Was your time here well-spent? Did you do some-
thing that mattered? Did your life mean something?
If you can’t say yes just now, be encouraged in know-
ing that you still have time to do something about it.

Letter to the Editor
At an off-campus Halloween party with 
the theme of “rappers and rockers,” two 
white students covered their faces and bodies with black makeup and dressed as black rappers.  It is critical to understand that this makeup — whether or not known or intended by the two students to have this effect — evokes “blackface,” which was used by white actors on Vaudeville and in other settings to represent African-Americans in a highly demeaning man-ner.  
I personally believe that demeaning any 
race is intolerable and completely counter to the welcoming and inclusive environ-ment that UF has created for its broadly di-verse campus community.  Demeaning any individual on the basis of race is contrary to UF’s strong nondiscrimination policy, which reflects and supports our diversity.  A number of organizations’ leaders, in-
cluding from the Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, Multicul-tural Greek Council, Panhellenic Council and local chapter of the NAACP, voiced their common reaction — that this makeup is offensive.  UF’s vice president for stu-dent affairs, Dave Kratzer, immediately and emphatically expressed his disap-pointment and explained why such actions are counter to the inclusiveness of UF.
Even though this action occurred off 
campus, at a non-UF event, it presents an important opportunity to raise awareness and protect the broad diversity that is part of UF’s excellence.
J. Bernard Machen,
President, University of Florida
As I write this column, I still have not decided who 
I will be voting for in this year’s presidential elec-tion. However, I will demand that whichever can-
didate is elected president has a more coherent Internet policy than we have had under previous administrations.
This isn’t to say Obama has done a poor job. In fact, 
I think the strides he has taken toward keeping the In-ternet free and supporting transparency in government have actually been fairly positive steps. I think his historic Aug. 29 “Ask Me Anything” thread on Reddit, in which the president answered questions on the social media site, showed — if nothing else — that he treats Internet policy as a serious issue, even if the dialogue of the two cam-paigns hasn’t emphasized it enough.
There is still a significant amount of work to be done. 
The freedom of the Internet is precarious, and we must be vigilant in protecting it.
A great deal of focus in the presidential campaign has 
been on the economy , as is probably necessary; yet, in my opinion, not enough of the dialogue has been about the role the Internet plays in the economy. If it’s not a huge campaign issue, it probably won’t be a huge governing issue. That’s a problem because it has to be.
A significant portion of the much-touted economic 
success during the Clinton years came as a direct result of the In-ternet boom. Some have suggest-ed that we may be on the verge of a second great wave of Inter -
net development, one that could 
carry our economy into the next decade or two.
With Web 2.0, a more modern update in the way the 
Internet is designed and used, finally finding a real place in the business world and showing viable revenue struc-tures, the Internet is more important to the economy than ever.
Since Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have 
found their place as some of the biggest companies in the world, the economy could be significantly hurt or helped depending on how we shape our Internet policy. These companies have business models that rely on relative freedom on the Internet. Any regulations surrounding these models need to be implemented with great care or, better yet, not put into place at all.
Yet, it is the Internet itself — the very nature of how we 
connect to each other in the modern world — that is fre-quently under attack from interest groups in Washington under the guise of fighting piracy.
Piracy is a serious problem, and it’s one I take very se-
riously, but that’s no excuse to push through poorly con-structed policy.
Our legislators have shown themselves to be woefully 
inept in terms of understanding how the Internet works and the role that it plays in the economy. The dialogue in this year’s presidential election so far has done very little to convince me this is going to change in the future.
Believe it or not, the Internet is actually more than a 
series of tubes, no matter what former members of the Senate might say. It’s time our representatives start acting like it.
Let’s start with the most important issue and demand 
the next president, whoever it may be, come up with a coherent and intelligent policy.

UWireAccording to some of the best available data, the Unit-
ed States has, since 2004, killed anywhere between 2,500 and 3,300 people in Pakistan using drone 
strikes. 
Of those killed, about 500 to 900 are suspected to have 
been civilians, including 176 children.
And now, a just-released report compiled by Stanford 
University and New York University students reveals how our country’s drone campaign, which has been expanded fivefold under Obama, is responsible for mass suffering and civilian death in the northwest region of Pakistan.
The evidence offered in this new report, along with what 
we knew before, makes it clear the U.S. needs to significant-ly reform its use of drones in the region, if not completely abolish it.
The report exposes that, far from being the “surgically 
precise and effective tool[s]” most Americans believe them to be, drones are actually incredibly violent and messy.
It points out, “While civilian casualties are rarely ac-
knowledged by the U.S. government, there is significant evidence that U.S. drone strikes have injured and killed ci-vilians.”
The U.S. in its Pakistani drone campaign — along with 
parallel campaigns elsewhere — has targeted a range of public establishments, from village squares to schools, in the pursuit of eliminating accused terrorists. This wide scope of targeted structures has, understandably , created a sense of fear and helplessness within the communities living under drones.
As one villager interviewed in the report explained, “Ev-
eryone is scared all the time. When we’re sitting together to have a meeting, we’re scared there might be a strike. When you can hear the drone circling in the sky , you think it might strike you. We’re always scared.”
The terror experienced by these Pakistani citizens, a ter -
ror documented through the many interviews and polls within the report, is far from surprising.
The Obama administration has also approved the use 
of “signature strikes,” drone attacks that target individuals whose identities are unknown, yet who seem to exhibit behavior in line with that of an active militant.
Such clearly unjust and destruc-
tive drone practices don’t just fill the affected Pakistani populations with 
terror, either. They also fill them with rage, and in doing so, help foster the very anti-American sentiment that our for -
eign enemies thrive off of. In the report, an affected mental health professional notes “the impact [the drone program] has on personality development,” stating that “people who have experienced such things, they don’t trust people; they have anger, desire for revenge.”
So now, among all the collateral deaths and destroyed 
properties, we find the policy we have instated to fight ter -
rorism may very well be fueling it.
Consider that for a moment.Not only does it turn out our drones terrorize entire 
Pakistani villages, but they might not even achieve their intended goal of combating terrorism. We simply cannot continue a policy that so indiscriminately and insensitively kills innocent civilians, especially when its efficacy is called into question.
In fact, because of its bloody record, our drone campaign 
has now come to embody the very terror it originally sought to vanquish.
Targeting emergency first-responders, or those gathered 
at funerals, or those attending village meetings, or those whose identities we don’t know, or even those who are sim-ply in the area and over the age of 18 — these are not the policies of a nation defending its freedom; these are the poli-cies of a nation terrorizing another’s populace.
America now has the responsibility to either change or 
end its drone program. That’s it.
If we continue on like this, we are embracing the very ter -
rorism we claim to despise, and in doing so, are abandoning the very values we claim to defend.

UWireThe center also offers a vari-
ety of outreach programs.
“The outreach programs are 
the key to getting students accu-
rate sex education on campus,” said Samantha Evans, a sexual health educator with GatorWell Health Promotion Services.
Evans said the Health Hut 
and the “Sex, Lies and Choco-late” presentation are just two of the programs that appeal to a diverse group of students.The Health Hut travels 
around campus, so students can get sex health and other health information on their way to and from class.
She said the presentation 
helps to dispel many sex myths and gets students educated on the consequences of sexual ac-tivity.
GatorWell also provides 
condoms, dental dams and lu-bricant to students at its loca-tion inside the Counseling & Wellness Center, she said.
Safe-sex education has also reached the residence halls, said Sydney Richardson, a 19-year-old digital arts and sciences sophomore.
“There were many free con-
doms and even free women’s condoms in my dorm’s com-mon room,” Richardson said. “It was kind of weird.”
She said UF’s ranking on the 
list isn’t of the utmost impor-tance.

not, we’re still on the list,” Rich-ardson said.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2012

Paul Morella, playing Clarence Darrow, looks at a temporary jury of au-
dience members at the Hippodrome State Theatre on Monday night.
� ABOUT 150 PEOPLE      
ATTENDED THE PLAY.
ALEX CATALANO
Alligator Staff Writer
About a half-dozen second-year 
law students peered through a 
crowd of balding and silver-haired heads to get a look at the past and their futures Monday night.
Actor Paul Morella played law-
yer Clarence Darrow in “A Passion for Justice: An Encounter with Clar -
ence Darrow,” the one-man-show he co-wrote with Jack Marshall.
Monday’s show was a benefit 
performance to aid the nonprofit, Gainesville-based legal firm South-ern Legal Counsel.
“It was a great opportunity for 
the community to learn more about what we do,” said the firm’s execu-tive director, Jodi Siegel.
Former Florida Gov . Kenneth 
“Buddy” MacKay, K COUNTRY DJ Lewis Stokes, law students and practicing lawyers were in the 150-person crowd at the $50-a-ticket function.
Morella portrayed the turn-of-
the-century lawyer as being initially young and lazy , but throughout the performance, he acted out Darrow’s triumphant moments of love, mar -
riage and success as a lawyer. Then he weaved in stories of defeat — like when Darrow was accused of brib-ing jury members to win a case.Morella also showcased Dar -
row’s intelligence. He often used techniques to manipulate the scene in a courtroom, once distracting ju-rors by inserting wire into a cigar to hold the ash intact. The jurors found themselves more focused on wait-ing for the ash to fall than listening to opposing arguments.
Nell Page, the development di-
rector for Southern Legal Counsel, said she thought the play was a good way to get the word out about the nonprofit.
“Theater is a wonderful way to 
have an audience feel a message,” she said. “People who leave here take away a feeling.”

For Taylor Nones, getting 
money to redecorate her apart-
ment started with an iPhone photo of her friend’s messy room.
The 19-year-old telecommu-
nication sophomore submitted the snapshot to The Daily Hun-dred, an iPhone app based in Gainesville that challenges us-ers to compete in daily photo-voting contests for a chance to win $100 and sometimes addi-tional prizes.
Nones and her roommates 
pooled their friends to pull ahead of the competition. They won the contest with about 80 votes.
“We were able to network,” 
Nones said.
The next day , she walked 
into The Daily Hundred’s office downtown and collected a $100 bill. She used the money to buy curtains for her apartment.
Nones is one of about 90 
winners since the app launched in August, said company CEO and co-founder Nick Haase, 23. The company has given $12,000 away to date.
The Pi Kappa Alpha fra-
ternity alumnus from Emory University reached out to Gainesville brothers to help gain hype for The Daily Hun-dred. Tapping into UF’s Greek community allowed his com-pany’s social networking to start strong, he said.
In the seven weeks since the 
app’s debut, The Daily Hun-dred app has been downloaded about 4,000 times, Haase said. 
“There hasn’t been a day 
with zero downloads,” he said.
Haase attributed the rapid 
growth to encouraging compe-tition between users with the incentive of a tangible prize.
“How many times have you 
logged in[to] Facebook to see who’s advertising on the side of the page?” he asked. “Our product is the advertisement.”
He described users getting 
in voting wars. Many people use texting, tweeting and face-booking to rally their friends behind their photos.
“You can have a cool pic-
ture,” Nones said, “but if you want to win, you have to know people that will download that free app for you and vote for 
you.”
At first, 
the cash priz-es were fund-
ed by private i n v e s t o r s . Now, some businesses  sponsor con-tests.
Haase and his 16-member 
staff share office space with about 10 other businesses at the Founders Pad.
For The Daily Hundred to 
land one of its biggest partners, Gator Domino’s franchise own-er Freddie Wehbe, some gueril-la advertising was necessary.
“I had to wait outside for an 
hour and a half for him to walk to his car,” vice president of promotion development Chris Dugosh said.
Wehbe said he partnered 
with The Daily Hundred be-cause he needed more traffic online. The contest he spon-sored helped the Gator Dom-ino’s Facebook page gain 288 new likes.
“I’ve never seen a one-day 
impact so powerful,” he said.

“I’m running to bring about real change and new 
leadership,” said Gaillot, the Democratic candidate. “I’ve worked in politics as a consultant, so I know how Washington works. We need high-paying jobs, and we need to allow small businesses to grow.”
Gaillot said he would get funding to build a new ter -
minal and expand the current runway for the airport. He said these changes could bring in more airlines, more permanent jobs and more revenue.
Yoho was against it, saying that the Environmental 
Protection Agency would not approve it. He said he has seen many airlines come and go, and he doesn’t feel the expansion is in demand.
Dodds did not say much about the subject. He said 
he feels that congressmen shouldn’t be focusing on the issue right now.

Dockens died at the hospital almost an 
hour after the altercation, said GPD
witness about Dockens lying facedown on the ground. 
Police blocked off the area while an ambulance took him to Shands at UF. 
Almost an hour later, Dockens died at the hospital 
from his wounds, GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said.
Officers interviewed bystanders and reviewed sur -
veillance photographs to pin Baxter as a suspect, To-bias said.
GPD investigators obtained an arrest warrant and called Dothan Police and the Houston County Sher -
iff’s Office, who then arrested Baxter on a first-degree murder charge Saturday afternoon, according to the release.
Police collected several knives from Baxter, Tobias 
said, but did not find the murder weapon.
Baxter is currently in Dothan Police Department 
custody on a $500,000 bond and will be brought back to Alachua County Jail some time this week, Tobias said.

Kenrick Watkins usually hands out 
chips, chicken tenders or miniburgers, but 
on Monday, the samples were cups of to-mato soup.
The 20-year-old psychology sophomore 
said he knew it was going to be cold when he could feel it in the morning.
“I’m usually not cold,” he said. “But 
when I woke up and things were frosty, and I was freezing, I knew it was cold.”
According to the National Weather Service, temperatures were in the mid-60s when he was handing out the free soups in his red apron and long-sleeve shirt.
Watkins usually stands beside Fletcher 
Drive outside the Gator Corner Dining Center to hand out samples and promote business for Chomp It, located at Racquet Club Dining Center, where he works as a chef and fills in other areas that need tend-ing.
He held a tray of about 30 shot-sized 
cups filled with portions of tomato soup he made. The samples people didn’t take steamed until cold gusts stole away their warmth.
Temperatures were forecasted to drop 
down to the 30s overnight. For today, there should be clear skies with temperatures peaking in the low 60s. The drop in tem-peratures is expected to remain until the weekend.
About half the people Watkins offered 
samples to would scoop one up at the op-portunity to eat something warm and free.
“That sounds perfect on a day like to-
day,” said 21-year-old business junior Katie Cairnes before she took a sample.
When about a half-dozen lukewarm to-
mato soups remained on his tray, Watkins made way for the hot pot waiting in the kitchen.
“We usually don’t hand out tomato 
soup,” he said. “But it’s cold out. We just wanted to give people a little bit of warmth.”

A new tutoring company is 
using one-on-one instruction to 
help students with their STEM classes.
The about two-week-old 
tutoring company, integra-teU, based in Orlando and Gainesville, is helping students excel by providing intensive, one-on-one academic attention.
Saajan Panikar, current 
chief operating officer and Gainesville branch manager, and Josh Kaplan, current CEO and Orlando branch manager, created integrateU in Novem-ber 2011 with the intention for it to serve a different purpose.
“It started out primarily as 
an academic networking site and then evolved into a tutor -
ing company ,” said Panikar, a 23-year-old UF alumnus.
Noticing that local tutoring 
companies, namely Tutoring-Zone and Study Edge, didn’t offer much study help for sci-ence, technology, math and en-gineering courses, commonly referred to as STEM courses, Panikar and Kaplan decided to create a service that catered pri-marily to these subjects.
According to the company’s 
website, tutoring services are $30 an hour for individuals, $20 an hour per person for groups of two to three people, $15 per person for groups of four to five people and $85 in total for groups of six or more.
“We felt that they were real-
ly underrepresented,” Panikar said. “Once you got to a certain point, there really were not tu-tors for these certain types of subjects.”
Students create an account 
on the website and then com-plete a profile with details in-cluding contact information, employment history , a personal statement and accomplish-ments.
Students book tutoring ses-
sions using the service’s online reservation system at www.in-tegrateu.com.
Contact information is ex-
changed through the website, and meet up in a public location for the session, Panikar said.
Nicholas Bevelock, a 
21-year-old microbiology and cell sciences UF senior was re-cently hired by integrateU’s Gainesville branch as tutor for several science subjects includ-ing microbiology.
“In our opinion, it’s much 
better than sitting in a lecture hall of about 100 people just listening to someone talk about the subject for an hour,” he said.
“We definitely see ourselves 
as a more cost-effective option than TutoringZone or Study Edge,” Panikar said.Math, science, tech

Gator basketball fans hugged 
their favorite stars, got signed post-

UF’s Gator basketball team 
hosted Rowdy Fest on Monday at the basketball complex to get stu-dents excited for the upcoming season.
The event brought in more than 
300 students for a tour of the prac-tice facility, food and a meet and greet with players and coaches.
Head coach Billy Donovan 
spoke to students as they huddled around him.
“Because of all of you and past 
students, you have created one of the best homecourt environments in all of college basketball,” Dono-van said. “Our building is not the same when you people are not there.”A new UF organization, Men’s 
Basketball Rowdies, helped the University Athletic Association at Rowdy Fest this year.
The founder of the organization, 
24-year-old computer and electrical engineering sixth-year Jake Sillick, said it was a good way to get the word out about the organization.
Senior guard Kenny Boynton, 
21, said the event is good for the team.
“It brings more fans out and 
shows them that we’re down-to-earth guys,” Boynton said. Gator basketball players get rowdy

Sam Kennedy doesn’t like using portable 
toilets at venues.
“Concert bathrooms are not fun,” the 18-
year-old animal sciences freshman said.
But three UF alumni may have found a 
solution to her problems with the Dunga-roo.
Liz Morris, a 2008 UF alumna, came up 
with the idea of creating a cheaper, cleaner, 
odorless and waterless portable toilet. She named it the Dungaroo.
Morris is the founder and CEO of Sanita-
tion Creations, which employs the two other Gators.
“People don’t realize how big of an issue sanitation is here,” said Sanitation Creations marketing director Matt Chais, a 2010 alum-nus.
Chais said the portable toilet collects 
waste in a bag. After a person “flushes” the toilet, the bag is closed, and a new bag ap-pears for the next person to use.
Each bag will be lined with chemicals to 
kill bacteria, Chais said.
The company plans to find a way to have 
the waste burned and used for electricity.
Office of Sustainability at UF’s zero waste coordinator Joseph Floyd said the com-pany’s ideas are good. However, he’s con-cerned chemicals in the bags that collect the waste will kill microbials, which are needed to produce energy from waste.
The company is still working out the de-
tails and the legal process of the project.
Chais said their portable toilets would 
cost about $215 to transport, install and empty, which is half of what other portable toilets cost to maintain.

Gators up for national awards 
Mike Gillislee and Matt Elam were named semiﬁ  nalists for three national awards on Monday. 
Gillislee is up for the Maxwell Award (most outstanding player), while Elam is up for the Bednarik Award (best defensive player) and the Jim Thorpe Award (top defensive back). Start time vs. Louisiana announced
Florida’s game against Louisiana on Nov. 10 will kick off at 12:21 p.m. and air on the SEC Network. Erika Tymrak was one of three Gators to earn a Southeastern Conference award on Monday. See story, page 16.  
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Jeff Driskel saw Frankie Hammond Jr. 
streaking down the sideline and let the ball 
ﬂ y .
  However, Driskel’s ﬁ  rst-quarter pass 
landed about 8 yards ahead of the redshirt senior receiver, who had a step on Georgia cornerback Sanders Commings.
  “Pretty much every route concept, there’s 
a deep route and shorter routes built in for pressure,” Driskel said. “They are bring-ing pressure a lot. There were times when I could have gone to deeper routes, but I chose to take the shorter ones. I missed a deep ball to Frankie. I threw one to him and I didn’t give him a chance. It comes down to giving your receiver a chance, and there was one when I threw it out of bounds.”
  The passing game hasn’t been Florida’s 
strong point this season. Through eight games, the Gators are 118th nationally in passing offense.
  No. 8 Florida has won games by holding 
on to the football and exhausting opponents with downhill running.
  On Saturday, the Gators couldn’t do ei-
ther, and the Bulldogs made them pay. 
  “In our league, they catch up pretty 
quick,” coach Will Muschamp said.
  Led by three sacks from Jarvis Jones, 
Georgia brought Driskel down behind the line ﬁ  ve times.
  “Defenses were bringing pressure and 
when they bring pressure, it turns into a quick game,” Hammond said. “Just throw-ing short passes and a couple times they got there before Driskel could get the ball out.”
  Wideouts caught only four passes on 
Saturday, with Quinton Dunbar hauling in three.
  Driskel targeted wideouts on 11 of his 27 
pass attempts.
  Tight end Jordan Reed is Florida’s lead-
ing pass catcher this season with 30 recep-tions for 355 yards.
Hammond leads UF wideouts with 27.5 
yards per game, ranking No. 36 in the South-eastern Conference.   
  Production at the wide receiver position 
hasn’t been an issue because Florida hasn’t needed to throw the football. And when the Gators do, receptions by Reed, Omarius Hines and Trey Burton account for 51 per-cent of Driskel’s completions.
  Georgia’s pressure forced Driskel to opt 
for shorter routes.
  Running back Mike Gillislee, with two 
receptions for 40 yards, recorded his second multi-catch game of the season on Saturday.
  “When there’s pressure, it’s hard, and 
we’ve played some great defensive lines,” Driskel said. “A lot of times with longer de-veloping routes, you can’t really step up in the pocket. You can’t move around. We’ve tried to get the ball out faster because of the pressure they’ve been bringing me. We haven’t hit too many deep plays, but we’re going to have to. We’ve been working on it. We took a couple shots. We just didn’t hit him.”
  Florida may not have the type of go-to 
receiver other SEC teams have, but a group of playmakers kept the Florida passing game from being a detriment before Saturday.
  Muschamp knows the Gators need to 
get versatile athletes like Burton and Hines  more touches in the passing game.
  Florida is last in the SEC in passing plays 
of 10 or more yards and is tied for 10th with 7.1 yards per attempt. 
  “You certainly want to be able to stretch 
the ﬁ  eld vertically,” Muschamp said. “We’re counting Trey; he’s a receiver for us. Omar-ius Hines is a receiver for us. We need to get him more involved in the game. We just need to continue to get more guys with the ball in their hands that can continue to make plays for us.”

FIRE JOE MORGAN
  The race for the Southeastern 
Conference Eastern Divi-sion is technically ongoing.
  Assuming Florida disposes of  
4-4 Missouri on Saturday, a Geor-gia loss to either Ole Miss or Au-burn in the next two weeks would send Coach Boom and his boys to Atlanta.
  That’s not going to happen. I 
mean, c’mon, right?
  The Gators said they wouldn’t 
keep an eye on the out-of-town scores, and I don’t blame them. Hoping the Bulldogs lose to the Rebels or the Tigers is just de-pressing.   But that doesn’t mean you and 
I can’t talk about the entertaining possibility.
  Ole Miss is a so-so squad, and 
Auburn is just awful.
  Usually, the Tigers would pres-
ent a stiff test, but since Satan is apparently out to get Gene Chizik — just ask his wife — Auburn is a terrible football team this season.
  Despite the obvious shortcom-
ings of both the Rebels and the Tigers, let’s talk about ways  the Bulldogs could pull off a colossal failure of epic proportions.1. Georgia plays down to its com-petition — The Bulldogs have nearly lost against sub-par confer-ence foes twice this season.
  On Sept. 29, Georgia simply 
outscored Tennessee in a 51-44 victory. Not until UGA forced back-to-back turnovers by UT quarterback Tyler Bray in the game’s ﬁ  nal three minutes did the Bulldogs escape at home against a team that is winless in SEC play this season.
  On the road at Kentucky on 
Oct. 20, Georgia eked out a 29-24 victory. Aaron Murray’s 427 pass-ing yards and four touchdowns overshadowed the team’s 77 rush-ing yards on 32 carries against the 11th-best rush de-fense in the SEC.

  Back-to-back victories against 
Auburn and Arkansas may not sound impressive, but for an Ole Miss squad many expected to ﬁ  n-ish last in the SEC West, it’s one hell of a feat.

  Aside from a 35-point loss

Although Florida’s matchup against Geor -
gia on Saturday featured five personal fouls 
and four unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, some of the most heated personal confronta-tions took place before the opening kickoff. 
On Monday, UF coach Will Muschamp 
said no disciplinary measures would be taken on account of the pregame altercation. 
As the Gators were running out of the tun-
nel, Matt Elam bumped into a Bulldogs player. Dominique Easley, who was one of the final Florida players to take the field, then began jawing with three other Georgia players. 
A group of six Florida assistants restrained 
Easley and Xavier Nixon. As Elam charged towards the Georgia players, two more assis-tants broke off to restrain him. 
UF director of strength and conditioning 
Jeff Dillman shouted at UGA running back Todd Gurley before shoving another player and confronting an assistant coach.
Injury update: Wideout Solomon Patton will 
miss the remainder of the season with a bro-ken bone in the upper half of his left arm, Mus-champ confirmed on Monday. Patton suffered the injury after being tackled high on a fourth-and-1 jet sweep on Saturday against Georgia. 
“He’s having a fantastic year,” Muschamp 
said. “We have to fill the void of what he gives you from a dynamic playmaker standpoint.” 
After missing Saturday’s game with a ham-
string injury , defensive tackle Damien Jacobs is expected to return to practice on Tuesday . 
Offensive linemen James Wilson and Xavier 
Nixon, who both suffered twisted knees in the game, are also expected to practice Tuesday . 
Muschamp expects linebacker Lerentee Mc-
Cray (ankle) to return to practice Wednesday. McCray is probable for Saturday’s game.

NOTEBOOK
West foes. Since 2008, he is 7-6 against 
the division. 4. Ole Miss is kind of average — The Rebels may not be setting the world ablaze, but they rank sixth or higher in the SEC in scoring offense, rushing offense, total offense, passing offense, pass efficiency, sacks, first downs, third-down conversions, fourth-down con-versions, penalties, red zone offense and red zone defense. So, yeah. They’re not terrible like Auburn.5. Auburn is basically an FCS team —  
Remember that time when Appalachian State beat Michigan? Maybe that could happen.
Hope is the ultimate double-edged 
sword. It can get you through tough times, but it will just as easily crush your dreams.
My advice? Root for Georgia.Alabama is clearly the best team in 
the nation, and Florida should want no part of the defending national champi-ons unless the crystal football is on the line.
If the Gators finish the regular season second in the SEC East with an 11-1 re-cord, their BCS title hopes stand a much better chance than those of the Bulldogs, who are unlikely to survive the wrath of the Crimson Tide in Atlanta.
Alabama benefitted from not playing 
in the SEC title game last year, earning a rematch against LSU and ultimately winning the national championship. 
So, enjoy these next few weeks of 
football. Florida has overachieved this season, and the national championship  race is technically ongoing.

After leaving the men’s basket-
ball team on Friday, Cody Larson 
faces an uncertain future. 
Larson could leave the sport 
altogether, transfer to another university or possibly return to the 10th-ranked Gators, coach Billy Donovan said. Regardless, Larson plans to finish out the fall semester at UF. 
Donovan said he would wel-
come Larson back if the 6-foot-9 forward had a change of heart. 
“If there’s anybody who knows 
about changing their mind, it’s me,” said Donovan, referring to his five-day stint in 2007 as coach of the Orlando Magic. 
“If he legitimately felt like 
a week or two weeks from now that, ‘I miss this. I made a huge mistake.’ … He could come back to our team. I understand as a young kid right now, there’s a lot swirling around in his head. I am not at all pushing him to come back. I didn’t give him some mo-tivational speech. The bottom line is if I really tried to persuade or influence him staying, at some point those feelings are going to resurface again.”
Donovan announced at the 
team’s media day on Oct. 10 that Larson would not play on schol-arship in 2012-13 because of his failure to handle responsibilities on and off the court last season.
In February 2010, Larson re-
ceived two years probation after sharing hydrocodone pills with a teammate. 
Larson and senior Erik Mur -
phy were arrested in April 2011 on charges of third-degree felony burglary. 
Donovan said neither incident 
factored in Larson having his scholarship revoked.
According to Donovan, Larson 
was playing some of his best bas-ketball in September and during the first two weeks of practice. But the sophomore said in a 
UF release that he needed to fo-cus on his personal life and aca-demics. 
“In this point in time, I don’t 
think he loves the game,” Dono-van said. 
“(He) just doesn’t love it, just 
doesn’t enjoy coming in and working.”
Larson recorded 12 points 
and 21 rebounds in 143 minutes across 25 contests in 2011-12. 
His decision to transfer leaves 
the team thin in the frontcourt. Patric Young, Will Yeguete and Murphy are the only eligible players on the roster taller than 6 feet, 6 inches. 
“I don’t think it’s a bad deci-
sion or a wrong decision,” Don-ovan said. “It’s his decision of what he thinks is best for him. … If he did come to me (about returning), I would be OK with that, but I would expect him to confront his team.”

Gators coach Becky Burleigh will have 
to make some more space on her already 
crowded mantel.
Burleigh, the only coach in Florida soc-
cer’s history, was named Southeastern Con-ference Coach of the Year for the fifth time on Monday. 
Burleigh credited the rest of the staff for 
helping the team earn the top seed in the SEC Tournament.
“If we don’t finish first in the league, I 
don’t think it happens,” she said. “It’s obvi-ously a team honor.”Burleigh wasn’t the only Gator who 
brought home hardware on Monday. 
Senior midfielders Erika Tymrak and 
Holly King each won individual awards. Tymrak was named SEC Offensive Player of the Year, and King won SEC Defensive Play-er of the Year. Both were named to the All-SEC first team alongside fellow midfielder Jo Dragotta.
Tymrak leads the Gators in points and 
assists while ranking second on the team in goals. Tymrak won the award despite not finishing in the top 10 in the SEC in points or goals. She ranks fourth in assists, eighth in points per game and second in assists per game.Tymrak was named to the All-SEC first 
team for the third straight season.
“I can’t believe this,” she said.
King was recognized 
for her play at defensive midfielder, where she pro-vided solid tackling and dominated when the ball was in the air. Dragotta called her “a beast in the 
air” on Sept. 25. 
King also added four 
goals this season, three of 
which came off headers.
“I’ve come a long way from not playing 
a minute in my first game my freshman year to this,” King said.
Dragotta made a name for herself this 
season. After not scoring in her first three years at Florida, she scored six times in nine games and is tied for the team lead in goals. 
“She started to have a breakout year last 
year, but I think she really took it to a new level this year,” Burleigh said.
Defender Christen Westphal rounded 
out the list of Gators honored Monday. The freshman was named to the All-SEC second team and to the All-Freshman team. She has started all but one game and has been a rock on a back line that has suffered several in-juries.
“Our team is stacked,” King said.
