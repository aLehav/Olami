Tennessee cannot break the “Dallas Baker 
Curse.” That’s how Baker’s family and friends 
see it, anyway.
The last time the Volunteers beat the Gators, 
Baker was penalized for unsportsmanlike con-duct in the game’s ﬁ  nal minute. The ﬂ  ag helped UT rally for a 30-28 win on Sept. 18, 2004.
“It’s kind of funny,” Baker said of the curse. 
“We joke all the time.”
Ofﬁ  cial Bobby Moreau threw the ﬂ  ag when 
Baker retaliated with a shove after Tennessee’s Jonathan Wade hit him in the facemask between third and fourth down.
“I wasn’t really thinking,” Baker said. “It all 
happened in slow motion.”
Teammates had told Baker in previous 
weeks to toughen up and play with more pas-sion. In that instance, the sophomore wide re-ceiver simply went too far.
“I made a boneheaded decision,” Baker said. 
“That wasn’t my way to show passion and ﬁ  re and stuff like that. That was the ﬁ  rst thing I thought about.”
The personal foul cost UF 15 yards and 
stopped the clock, helping UT win with six sec-onds remaining.
“On the way home, I remember I was ﬁ  ght-
ing back the tears because my teammates kept telling me it was OK, that we all make mis-takes,” Baker said. “But inside, I felt like I was the reason we lost.”
The backlash in Gainesville was ﬁ  erce. “Thanks, Dallas,” frustrated Florida fans 
wrote on the 34th Street wall.
“That crushed me even more,” Baker said.Tennessee kicker James Wilhoit was on track for a similar fate that same night.
Before Baker’s pivotal ﬂ  ag, Wilhoit was the 
goat as the Volunteers trailed 28-27.
Tennessee had matched Florida touchdown 
for touchdown all night, but a botched extra point by Wilhoit in the ﬁ  nal minutes allowed UF to run out the clock.
The Gators seemed destined to claim their 
third straight victory in Knoxville, Tenn.
Wilhoit took the kick for granted. He had 
never missed an extra point before then as a Volunteer. He admitted he got lazy. He shanked the kick wide right. He was in shock.
“The sudden reality started to kick in,” Wil-
hoit said. “And I said, ‘If this game ends the way it could, then it’ll be my fault that we lost the game.’ I was desperate for an opportunity. Once I missed that extra point, I knew that it was my fault and I had just had a really bad mistake.”
Wilhoit was dying for a second chance. Wade 
and Baker’s exchange gave him hope.
When Tennessee got the ball on its own 39-
yard line with no timeouts and 43 seconds re-maining, Wilhoit sought out Volunteers offen-sive coordinator Randy Sanders.
“Just get me across midﬁ  eld, and I’ll make 
it,” Wilhoit told Sanders.
Thirty-seven seconds later, Wilhoit split 
the uprights from 50 yards away. Gators fans mockingly thanked Baker following the game, but Wilhoit said they should be thanking him.
“Ron Zook was your coach at the time,” 
Wilhoit said of what he tells Florida fans. “Mak-ing that ﬁ  eld goal, and then you guys losing to Mississippi State a couple of weeks later, all of a sudden that led to Urban Meyer being the head coach. So, in the long run, you guys may have lost the battle, but you won the war.”�          �           �
The war raged throughout the 1990s between 
the Gators and the Volunteers. After the South-eastern Conference split into two divisions and established the SEC Championship Game in 1992, either Florida or Tennessee represented the East every year until 2002.
“It became a big rivalry for Florida and for 
Tennessee, I guess, because we were, in the ear-ly ‘90s, the two best teams in the East,” former Gators coach Steve Spurrier said. “Tennessee and us were usually ﬁ  ghting it out for the di-vision championship in those years, so it was a huge game.”
Wilhoit, who grew up a Volunteers fan, was 
always invested in the UF-UT series.
He said Tennessee’s rivalry with Florida 
even surpassed the Vols’ rivalry with Alabama, known as the “Third Saturday in October.”
Wilhoit looked up to former Volunteers 
kicker Jeff Hall, who also beat Florida with a game-winning ﬁ  eld goal. Hall’s kick preserved Tennessee’s perfect record en route to winning the 1998 national title.
“Florida was our hated rival,” Wilhoit said. 
“That was the game that I wanted to perform well, and that was one that I always remem-bered. So to play well in that game and to make that kick made it that much sweeter.”
After beginning the annual series in 1990, 
Florida took six of the ﬁ  rst eight games as part of a run of four straight SEC titles from 1993-1996. Tennessee played in the Florida Citrus Bowl — now known as the Capital One Bowl — three times during that span.
In the spring of 1997, Spurrier famously 
joked, “You can’t spell Citrus without U-T.”
But once Peyton Manning — who never beat 
Florida — left Tennessee after 1997, the series in-tensiﬁ  ed. Tennessee took four of the next seven contests — ﬁ  ve decided by single digits — with an average margin of victory of only 6.3 points per game.
UF even ended up in the Citrus Bowl a 
couple of times, prompting UT fans to jab right back at Spurrier. A plane ﬂ  ew over the 1998 Florida Citrus Bowl between Florida and Penn State with a banner that read: “Vols: Welcome the Gators to the FLA Citrus Bowl!”
Spurrier also enjoyed the increased competi-
tiveness in the late ‘90s. He said he remembers every game against Tennessee, but he has a soft spot for Florida’s 27-23 comeback win in 2000.
“All their students were ready to swarm the 
ﬁ  eld,” Spurrier said. “They were ready to come out there and then all of a sudden they just stood there and looked at each other for a while. So I’d say that was my favorite.”
Although Spurrier got on the nerves of Wil-
hoit and other Tennessee fans, the kicker always respected the Ol’ Ball Coach. Wilhoit admired Spurrier’s will to win.
“I liked his moxie and his ability and his 
mentality to kind of go for the throat,” Wilhoit said. “He was going to go for the jugular. So I respected that part of it. He’s a great coach.”
�          �           �
The Volunteers faced a nemesis worse than 
Spurrier when Urban Meyer came to Florida. After Ron Zook went 4-5 in games against Geor-gia, Florida State and Tennessee, Meyer vowed to crush Florida’s rivals.
And crush them the Gators did, running up 
a 16-2 record against UGA, FSU and UT during Meyer’s six years in Gainesville. The Bulldogs and Seminoles each managed a victory during that span, but the Volunteers were 0-6.Florida has won eight straight contests  
against UT by an average margin of 15.5 points per game. The past six games were decided by double digits.
Tennessee has only three winning seasons 
since Meyer started at UF in 2005 and has lost six or more games six times during that span.
UT last won the SEC East in 2007. The Gators 
beat the Vols 59-20 that year.
The rivalry ﬂ  ared up when Lane Kifﬁ  n ac-
cused UF of a recruiting violation involving Nu’Keese Richardson in 2009. But the claim was unfounded, and Meyer beat Kifﬁ  n in the latter’s lone year as Tennessee’s coach.
Will Muschamp picked up where Meyer left 
off, defeating UT in each of his ﬁ  rst two years.
Meanwhile, the Volunteers have had ﬁ  ve 
different head coaches since 2008.
Blame the “Dallas Baker Curse”?“The guy watched us both — then threw a 
ﬂ  ag, and they haven’t beat us since,” Baker said. “So I feel like maybe there is a ‘Dallas Baker Curse.’”
The lopsidedness of recent meetings has re-
sulted in mixed opinions of whether or not the once-great SEC matchup is still a rivalry. Both coaches think so.
“It’s still a huge rivalry,” Muschamp said. 
“It’s a very important game at the University of Florida.”
“Our players understand the rivalry, what is 
at stake,” UT coach Butch Jones told the Associ-ated Press. “I think they understand what has gone on before them.”
So does Jeff Driskel.“It goes way back,” the quarterback said. 
“Two storied programs. Since I’ve been here, for a while, we’ve dominated the series, but I know they’re gunning for us. They always do. And they always put up a good ﬁ  ght against us.”
Lighthearted questions on players’ opinions 
of “Rocky Top” dominated game week rather than the SEC title implications that seemed at stake every time UF and UT met in years past.
Some former players believe the rivalry has 
lost its edge.
“This isn’t a rivalry for Florida for the fact 
that they don’t think that they’re going to lose to us,” Wilhoit said. “I don’t think that this rivalry is truly going to heat up until we start getting a couple of victories.”Former Gators wide receiver Jacquez Green 
added.“I think the fans and sportswriters make it more of a rivalry now. I think a rivalry is when both teams have an equal chance of winning on a yearly basis.”
But whether the rivalry is alive or dead, the 
nostalgia remains.
“I remember telling (Tim) Tebow and all 
those young guys, ‘This is a game here that you dream about playing in,’” Baker said. “I remem-ber telling them, ‘This is a game that you never want to lose.’”

Gator fans have a new way to show their 
school spirit.
With a new application, Fanmento!, us-
ers can use UF-themed templates to decorate 
photos they snap on the spot or pull from their photo library. 
Users can also post the pictures to Facebook 
or Twitter and order prints in different sizes. The free app, which was created through a 
partnership with the University Athletic Asso-ciation, launched at UF on Monday, said  Fan-mento! founder and CEO Jason Muslin.
Users within one mile of the stadium can 
check in online and access more templates speciﬁ  c to the location.
“Nowhere else can fans put themselves 
front and center in an image in an application and bring their team’s colors and logo to life,” Muslin said. “Everyone wants to take cool pictures. This is a way to do it by yourself on your own time if you’re a Gator fan live at The Swamp or a Gator fan in New York.”
Kyle Clavier and Ryan Hundersmarck, 
both 19-year-old UF environmental engineer-ing sophomores, said they think students will use the app.
Hundersmarck said it seemed like a good 
way for clubs and organizations to take group pictures at the games.
“It’s easy to use, and you don’t have to 
have any advanced Photoshop knowledge,” Clavier said.

UF now ranks fourth nationally among the nation’s 
leaders in startup launches.
Helping to create 15 startups last year, the university 
was ranked fourth behind the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and the University of California and Univer-sity of Texas systems, according to a report from the As-sociation of University Technology Managers.
“UF has almost $700 million dedicated to research. With 
every $2 million to $2.5 million of research, there is a new discovery,” said Jane Muir, associate director of the UF Of-ﬁ  ce of Technology Licensing.
The ofﬁ  ce, which was ranked 11th in the U.S. for number 
of licenses and options granted, works to help UF students and alumni mold ideas into products that can be patented, licensed and made available to the public, according to a news release.
“The goal of research is to come up with the discoveries, 
but those discoveries don’t do any good unless they end up in the marketplace,” Muir said.

There’s been a great disturbance 
in the tutoring world.
The two main tutoring compa-
nies in Gainesville have traditional-
ly competed for students in Organic Chemistry 1 and 2, as both offer tu-tors. But as of last week, the famous TutoringZone tutor Lauren Figler, has switched her allegiance.
“I don’t think it makes sense for 
students to have to choose between what were two great alternatives,” Figler wrote in an email. “While some students could afford to pay for both, many students could not and had to choose. Now, students don’t have to make the choice.”
As for the students who have al-
ready paid for TutoringZone mem-bership in the hopes of having Figler as their tutor, Study Edge has a solu-tion.
Study Edge is now offering free 
memberships to the affected stu-dents, said Ethan Fieldman, presi-dent and cofounder of Study Edge. 
“We don’t want students to pay 
twice for Lauren because, quite frankly, that gets expensive,” he said.Fieldman said they have had stu-
dents come in since the switch spe-ciﬁ  cally asking for Figler as their tu-tor. Figler said none of her students have complained about the switch.
“I don’t think it’s been an issue at 
all,” she said. 
Along with the addition of a sec-
ond organic chemistry tutor, Study SEE STARTUP, PAGE 4“It’s easy to use, and you

The Hippodrome State The-
atre has a new producing director, 
the theater’s board of trustees an-nounced this week.
Thomas Eldon Anderson has 
been appointed as the new produc-ing director and will begin on Oct. 1, according to a news release.
Anderson was chosen by a 
community committee out of 50 nominees from across the country, said Mary Hausch, the theater’s current producing director.
His duties will include oversee-
ing the theater’s UF student out-reach programs, which help bring in 7,000 students to watch produc-tions put on by theater students at the university, Hausch said.
“Anderson has a keen sense of 
bringing his knowledge and love of theater and balancing it with an administrative side to help excel programs in place,” Hausch said.
Anderson said he aims to install 
new programs to further connect the theater to the community.“I want to protect what’s 
good and pose questions to all of Gainesville so I can use all of my resources,” he said.
Belle Jampol, an 18-year-old UF 
theatre freshman, said she thinks Anderson will effectively bridge the gap between students and the production house.
“It is refreshing for someone 
with an open mind and a creative vision to come in and work to intertwine the students into the Hippodrome’s productions,” she said.
New Hippodrome producing director steps in, starts in October
The producing director is responsible for:
• Managing the business side of the theater
• Establishing community relationships• Coordinating with marketing and communications departments
Anderson's biographical information:
• 55 years old• Former Hippodrome actor• Moving from Baton Rouge, La., to take the job  
in Gainesville
• Master’s degree, Southern Methodist University  
in Texas
Edge now offers weekly online reviews 
for Organic Chemistry 1 and 2. 
However, the switch isn’t as dramatic 
as some might think, Fieldman said. 
Jenn Worthington, the current Study 
Edge organic chemistry tutor, and Figler are good friends who worked together for a few years previously at Tutoring-Zone. Figler called her reunion with her colleague “a weight off my shoulders.”“It’s the best of both orgo worlds,” 
Figler said. 
She has been tutoring students in 
chemistry and organic chemistry since 2000 and said she’s happy her transition allows her to continue doing what she loves.
TutoringZone declined to comment. 
But Fieldman said even with the mid-semester move, it was simple. 
“It’s a really smooth and easy transi-
tion, and the students are really happy with it so far,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2013

STUDY , from page 1She’s tutored in orgo since ’00Sid Martin hosts many of them
include medicine developed to treat patients 
with brain injuries, gene therapy for blind dogs, a medical records mobile app and an air-pad cooling system for Gator football players to use during games.
“The technologies are across the board,” 
Muir said. “A lot of these products are life-changing.”
In the last 12 years, it has launched nearly 
140 biomedical and technology startups.
One startup is AxoGen Inc., a company 
founded in Gainesville in 2002 dedicated to providing surgical solutions to patients with peripheral nerve injuries.
Peripheral nerves carry signals to the brain 
and allow people to feel sensations and move muscles. They can be damaged in many ways, said Jill F. Sciaparelli, senior vice president of business strategy and marketing at AxoGen.
AxoGen develops products that repair and 
protect peripheral nerves. The company has three different brands available in the United States and seven other countries.
“AxoGen has developed great momentum 
and we hope to continue that moving for-ward,” said Sciaparelli.
AxoGen’s ofﬁ  ces are at UF’s Sid Martin Bio-
technology Incubator, which is host to more than two dozen other startups.STARTUP , from page 1FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

in Gainesville despite a certain assistant city attorney’s deci-sion to go rogue with a butt-naked break-in of a local wom-an’s home. Will Ferrell should star in a new movie this year: “Stranger than Gainesville Local Politics.”
Here we go: Your I’m-still-getting-used-to-iOS-7-and-its-
lack-of-textures edition of . . .
Darts & Laurels
We’re handing yet another LAUREL to Pope Francis for 
being an all-around rad guy. Yesterday, he told the world the 
Catholic Church must move beyond “small-minded rules,” i.e. hating on gay people, abortion and contraceptives.
According to CBS News, he said, “The teaching of the 
church, for that matter, is clear and I am a son of the church, but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time.”
While we don’t exactly plan on becoming your Indepen-
dent Catholic Alligator anytime soon, we have to give the Pope some props — he’s using his inﬂ  uence to spread a mes-sage of tolerance.
Speaking of intolerance: If you’ve been on Twitter since 
the Miss America pageant, you probably saw the onslaught of racist, ignorant tweets about Nina Davuluri. Wow, people on Twitter becoming angry over nonissues and spouting stu-pidity? Cutting edge.
However, it seems the racists of Twitter aren’t being the 
only jerks about Davuluri’s win. According to TIME, people in India have a problem with the color of her skin as well — yep, the actual color of her skin. Skeptics say, what with the prevalence of skin-bleaching products in India, that Davu-luri would never win a beauty pageant in her parent’s home country, because her skin is “too dark.”
So this week, a DART to dumb Americans who don’t 
know the difference between Islam and Hinduism, and to Indians who can’t appreciate how on-point Davuluri looked in that yellow dress.
In other beauty pageant news, it appears France is ﬁ  nally 
the ﬁ  rst do something. Earlier this week, members of the French Parliament voted to ban beauty pageants for girls un-der the age of 16, according to NPR. 
A thanks-for-teaching-little-girls-that-they’re-worth-more-
than-their-looks LAUREL goes to the French Parliament — 
although it’s kinda weird that a bunch of old guys sat around talking about little girls’ beauty pageants under the guise of the lawmaking process. C’est la vie, we suppose.
OK guys, listen up: It’s 2013, and you need to stop being 
so racist. 
This week, the University of Alabama’s president liter-
ally had to mandate new sorority recruitment rules after a 
surge of racial discrimination allegations. To University of 
Alabama sororities, we hand off a this-is-too-much-racism-for-one-week DART.
That’s all for this week, folks. Have fun at the game tomorrow — lots of sunscreen-
smeared, water-drinking, sensible-shoe-wearing fun.

given a teacher a hot chili pepper on RateMyProfessors? Today’s question: Have you downloaded iOS7?Public perception of Obama will plummet
Often, leaders are remembered for their failures 
rather than their accomplishments. 
American presidents are no exception to this 
rule. According to C-SPAN.org, the worst U.S. presi-dent of all time is James Buchanan, famous for his role in the Dred Scott case and for his lifelong single marital status. 
Richard Nixon, the 37th president, will be most 
remembered for the Watergate scandal. However, it would be an injustice — and in bad taste — to not con-sider all of a leader’s actions when evaluating them. 
For instance, despite the fact that pseudo-liberals 
love to denigrate former President George W. Bush for his military endeavors, the former Republican president gave more aid to Africa than any other American presi-dent — an accomplishment that often goes unnoticed. 
Under the President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Re-
lief program, Foreign Policy reported the U.S. has spent $44 billion on combating AIDS, an expenditure that, ac-cording to Secretary of State John Kerry, has saved 5 million lives. 
This brings us to President Barack Obama, a man of 
African descent, who has proposed cutting the AIDS re-lief program budget. 
How will the 43rd president of the United States be 
remembered? 
When evaluating a leader, one should examine both 
competence and catastrophe — so examine we shall. Faced with an economic downturn, two wars and the rising threat of Islamic extremism, Obama inherited a number of headaches when he assumed ofﬁ  ce in 2008. 
During his ﬁ  rst term, Obama accomplished victories 
as historic as repealing the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy and as minor as getting the FDA to regulate tobacco, and only homophobes and tobacco planters could op-pose such progress. He also passed health care reform and saved the American auto industry. With such progressive poli-
cies, why would anyone deﬁ  ne this president by failure? 
Well, there are four notable 
failures that people may choose to remember Obama by. 
By the time he moved into 
the Oval Ofﬁ  ce, the president had promised to close the infa-
mous Guantanamo Bay prison. 
According to NPR, the prison was supposed to be 
closed by executive order but was opposed by legisla-tion that prohibited any detainees from being moved to the U.S. 
Similarly, Obama also advertised himself as a candi-
date against the Patriot Act in order to distinguish him-self from Bush.
However, the massive and overly intrusive PRISM 
scandal left the president exposed. According to The Hufﬁ  ngton Post, PRISM allowed the NSA to collect phone records and other personal information. 
Aside from his post-9/11 Bush-like policies, the 
greatest defeat that the president has suffered may be in the hands of a domestic enemy rather than a foreign one: the NRA. 
A series of mass shootings have scarred the Obama 
presidency, and these were followed only by brief rhet-oric and congressional impotence. 
It seems as though Obama may be a president who 
cannot follow through on his promises — or perhaps an idealist conﬁ  ned by the restrictions a Republican legis-lature has to offer. 
Regardless of how you will remember the man who 
won the Nobel Prize, one thing should be painfully ob-vious: Obama shouldn’t cut aid to Africa.

Bring Noam Chomsky to UF
Marx, Lenin, Shakespeare, Aristotle, 
the Bible, Plato, Freud, Chomsky, He-
gel and Cicero: One of these things is not like the others. All of them are ten of the most cited authors of all time, but only one of them is currently living. 
Noam Chomsky has been called the 
world’s “top public intellectual.”  
In the early stages of his career he 
revolutionized the study of language — an accomplishment that alone would have ensured the preservation of his legacy in the history of science forever. He has contributed more than 30 books to the ﬁ  eld.
Thus, like many people all through-
out Gainesville and North Central Flor-ida in general, I was overjoyed to hear that Chomsky was expected to speak at UF this Fall.
However, it is now unknown wheth-er or not Chomsky will be welcome to speak at UF, and if he will be allotted a venue worthy of the occasion.
It would be criminal to not do ev-
erything in our power as a university to host an address by the famous thinker.
An appropriate analogy would be 
if students at an 18th-century French university were not sure whether or not they could accommodate a public lecture by Voltaire.
Residents of Gainesville, I urge you 
to demand Chomsky be welcome to speak in a venue that gives the most people possible an opportunity to see and hear what he has to say.
To pass up this opportunity would 
not only be a mistake but a disturbing act of ignorance.

� THE NOISE WAS A HOT TOPIC AT 
THE CITY COMMISSION MEETING.
PATRICIA POTESTADES
Alligator Contributing Writer
The noise emitted by the new Gainesville 
Renewable Energy Center-run biomass plant, 
which some have compared to the sound of screaming jet engines, moved about 10 Tur-key Creek subdivision residents to voice their concerns at the Gainesville City Commission meeting Thursday. 
“This is condemnation without compensa-
tion,” Russ Pisano, 72, told commissioners.Pisano said no one had said anything to 
him about the possible effects of the biomass plant. He only learned about the side effects after it had been built.
Turkey Creek residents have also com-
plained the plant causes a sticky wood residue to form on cars left outside overnight. Some said it wafts a foul smell of musty vegetation through the air and lowers home values.Pisano has taken decibel measurements, 
and when the plant is running, he said, it cre-ates a 20 to 30 decibel jump in noise level.
He told commissioners he has not slept 
well for the past few days because the plant had been running at night. Other residents said they’ve had similar experiences.  
“Sleep deprivation is not allowed for pris-
oners at Guantanamo Bay because it’s consid-ered torture,” said Peter Perkins, 67, a resident of Turkey Creek. But the Turkey Creek com-munity has been subjected to that “torture” every night for the past few days, he said.
The residents have started up a petition in 
hopes that Gainesville will apply its already established noise ordinance to the facility. The organizers are requesting the biomass plant only run between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. and that it be turned off at night. At the commission meeting, they requested the same reduction of hours.
The city commissioners responded saying 
the same thing Albert Morales, the managing director of GREC, told residents in a letter: GREC is planning to take noise level measure-ments around the facility and see if there are any modiﬁ  cations that can be made to the plant to help reduce the noise.
City Commissioner Yvonne Hinson-Rawls 
told residents the city does have a noise ordi-nance and may at some time start issuing cita-tions to the plant.
Biomass plant could get noise citations after residents complained
“Sleep deprivation is not allowed 
for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay 
because it’s considered torture.”

PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer @phillip_heilman
Dominique Easley is his own harshest critic. 
Despite No. 19 Florida boasting the nation’s 
third-best total defense — the Gators are allow-ing a meager 208.5 yards per game this season — Easley, the unquestioned leader of the unit, is unsatisfied. 
“In my life, I strive for 
perfection,” Easley said. “If there’s no perfection, there’s no greatness, and 
we are supposed to be great.”
Raw numbers suggest Easley and the UF de-
fense have already succeeded in reaching great-ness — even if the 6-foot-2, 285-pound senior defensive tackle believes otherwise. 
The Gators have allowed 13.5 points per 
game — 17th fewest in the country — despite facing Toledo and Miami, teams that have com-bined to average 30 points per game when not facing Florida this season.
UF’s defense has been even better on third 
down — often considered the money down for great defenses — to help the Gators control the ball each game for 39:04, the nation’s top time of possession. 
Of the 24 third-down conversions attempt-
ed by the Rockets and Hurricanes, the Gators have surrendered just two first downs for a 91.7 percent success rate, which is 7.3 percent better than any other defense in the country.  
Still, Easley believes there is room for im-
provement before the Gators can be considered an elite defensive unit. 
“Our goal is not to let an offense score, pe-
riod,” he said. “So once we manage to get that stat, we could say we have one of the best de-fenses.”
Of his own play, Easley added: “I think I can 
play better. … I just gotta step it up more.”
D.J. Durkin expressed a more positive opin-
ion on Easley’s play when asked Wednesday, but Florida’s first-year defensive coordinator was pleased to hear of Easley’s desire for self- and team-improvement. 
“He’s played better than all right,” Durkin 
said of Easley. “I’m glad he’s hard on himself that way. He’s a very self-motivated guy. That guy has an unbelievable motor, and he’s defi-nitely been better than all right.”
Easley has spearheaded Florida’s defense 
this season. He is tied for second on the team with two tackles for a loss and three quarterback hurries. He has also added four total tackles. 
His play has caught the attention of former 
Florida defensive lineman Sharrif Floyd, who spent three seasons in the trenches with Easley.
“He’s a top-10 pick in my eyes,” said Floyd, 
who is now a defensive lineman for the Min-nesota Vikings. 
“We’ve all got our opinions, but I’ve physi-
cally played next to him and see and practiced with him, so I know what he can do.”
Easley’s versatility will be put to the test 
against Tennessee on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. The Volunteers fea-ture one of the nation’s staunchest offensive lines and have allowed just two sacks in three games this season. 
“It’s a big challenge for our [defense],” Dur-
kin said. “I think they’re excited for it.”

the Hurricanes on Sept. 7 in Sun Life Stadium. UF is No. 3 in the nation in total defense, allowing 208.5 yards per game this season.
Who’s excited for the annual 
butt-whoopin’ that’s become the 
jorts-wearing rednecks vs. those toothless hillbillies (DISCLAIMER: If you kiss your cousins, eat raccoon backstraps for breakfast, live in the hills and play the fiddle for Friday night entertainment, STOP READ-ING!). 
Our favorite announcers, Un-
cle Verne and Gary, return to The Swamp for what should be Florida’s ninth straight victory against the team that couldn’t even beat the Gators with the greatest quarterback to ever live. 
No, we’re not talking about Tyler 
Bray.
Here to debate the college foot-
ball game of the week are Phil Heil-man and Joe Morgan. 
They’ll be debating No. 23 Arizo-
na State (2-0) vs. No. 5 Stanford (2-0) because the Southeastern Confer-ence slate is as putrid as Tennessee’s quarterback play. It’s just downright stinky.
Arizona State (+9) will pluck ev-
ery string off Stanford’s old banjo because...
Their mascot — the Cardinal — is 
a color. Not the bird. A color. That’s all I really have to say about the Pa-cific-12 Conference. Oh, yeah. Or-egon’s good. 
- Joe Morgan
Stanford (-9) will drink all of 
Arizona State’s moonshine be-cause...
Andrew Luck is really good. 
Have you seen that guy throw the football? Wait, what? He’s in the NFL now? Well, I have always been a big fan of trees.

Leading the pack at 18-5-1 is Fightin-
Gators.com’s Cody “Research? What’s 
that?” Jones, who bragged that he merely goes with his gut while picking against the spread. Yeah, bud. Blind squirrels occa-sionally ﬁ  nd nuts.
Next up at 16-7-1 is alligatorSports 
editor Phil “Tough Love” Heilman, who could use an appearance on a VH1 dating show after revealing his recent relation-ship status — or lack thereof. Live it up, Phil. I heard some of those Tennessee fans are actually ﬁ  ne ladies. Right, Holt?
Tied for third  at 15-8-1 is alligator-Sports Staff Writer Adam “Happy Val-ley” Pincus, who spent ﬁ  ve days in State College, Penn., to visit his girlfriend last week. He probably spent more than just gameday in Beaver Stadium, if you know what I mean. Just kidding, I’m sure she’s a nice, respectable young lady.
Also tied for third at 15-8-1 is alligator-
Sports assistant editor Adam “I have no fashion sense” Lichtenstein, who rocked some nice Sperrys with white crew-cut socks at the Florida-Miami game. Jeez, I know you love your mother, but I think it’s time you have her stop  buying your clothes and dressing you in the morning.
Also tied for third at 15-8-1 is alligator-Sports Staff Writer Joe “WE DON’T NEED TEBOW, OK?!” Morgan, who continues to root for the most hopeless team in the NFL. C’mon, Joe, it’s time to move on. No ugly uniform combination or washed up quarterback will ever save that franchise.
Coming in fourth with a record of 14-9-1 
is 247sports.com’s Thomas “Toledo Rock-ets in ﬂ  ight...” Goldkamp, who couldn’t contain his excitement at ﬁ  nding Toledo’s punt scheme in the locker room this week. Dude, it’s Toledo. Florida could’ve fallen asleep for the ﬁ  rst quarter, drank some Tennessee moonshine for the second and still have beaten them. Quit fetishizing stats!And in dead-ass last place with a piss 
poor record of 12-11-1 is the Orlando Sen-tinel’s Edgar “You better not put that in the P-p-picks Column!” Thompson, who is more defensive of his lifestyle than Brent Pease is of Florida’s offense for fear it will be printed in these pages. Chill  out, Ed-gar. Nobody reads newspapers anymore, right?
Also in dead-ass last with a piss-poor 
record of 12-11-1 Bryan “Baby Mama” Holt, who bagged, well, something the night before the Florida-Tennessee game in Knoxville last season. If you see an ab-normally small baby wearing jorts with a mullet and crying for some creamsicle, you know where his bloodline lies.

ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
Will Muschamp said on Wednesday that 
he considered freshman cornerback Vernon 
Hargreaves III a starter despite having played only two college games.
That does not surprise Hargreaves’ former 
high school coach, David Mitchell.
“I just know he’s a special ballplayer,” 
Mitchell said.
Hargreaves has made his mark on the UF 
defense early in his college career. 
He has interceptions in each of his ﬁ  rst two 
games and will look to continue that streak when No. 19 Florida (1-1) takes on Tennessee (2-1) at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday in Ben Hill Grif-ﬁ  n Stadium.
“He’s played really well for us this season,” 
defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. “He’s deﬁ  nitely considered a starter. Wherever that is at, he’s one of those guys in the mix.”
Hargreaves will likely get a greater oppor-
tunity to showcase his skills this coming week because space has cleared at the top of the depth chart. Senior Jaylen Watkins previously started at cornerback, but this week’s depth chart listed him at safety. Hargreaves was — and is still — listed as a second-team player, but both Muschamp and Durkin said he will see plenty of reps during 
the game.
“ I think Vernon is the 
furthest (freshman) along as far as being out there and helping us,” Durkin said. 
Hargreaves was a ﬁ  ve-
star prospect coming out of Tampa Wharton High, ac-
cording to Rivals.com, and he has lived up to the hype so far this season. 
Teammates and coaches alike have praised 
his knowledge and his athleticism.
“Obviously he has great talent and abil-ity to play the position,” Durkin said. “He’s a very mature guy.”
Both Durkin and Mitchell credited Har-
greaves’ environment growing up as helping him become the player he is today. Hargreaves’ father, Vernon Hargreaves, is currently the linebackers coach at Houston. He was previ-ously the defensive ends coach and special teams coordinator for South Florida.
“He’s been around football all of his life,” 
Mitchell said. “It’s knowledge and being around football.”
Said Durkin: “He’s a coach’s son, and you 
can tell … He carries himself like an experi-enced veteran, and it shows on the ﬁ  eld.”
