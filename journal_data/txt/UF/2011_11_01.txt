  After 59 years of covering the small towns sur-
rounding Gainesville, the North Florida Herald is 
closing.
  Ron Dupont, the paper’s owner, editor and 
publisher, announced the decision in a Sunday 
email addressed to UF journalism students who 
had applied for internships with the Herald, in-ternships that will no longer be available.
  He then wrote his paper’s obituary Monday 
afternoon.
  After two years of slowly losing advertisers as 
local businesses tightened their belts or went out of business, Dupont made the decision to close the paper Friday night after going through ﬁ  nances.
  The award-winning weekly newspaper needs 
$120,000 to continue operations through Decem-ber 2012. If Dupont does not get this soon, the “closed” sign will be hung on the Herald’s doors Community

  On Monday, visitors to UF’s 
home page will ﬁ  nd new features 
and a cleaner, simpler look.  UF made the change to main-
tain an up-to-date presence on the Web, according to an UF News 
press release. 
  The new home page will 
maintain all tabs and links pro-
vided on the current home page.A full redesign will begin in 2012 
and take 18 months to complete, 
according to the release.
  Bioengineering senior Lauren Redfern, 21, said she thinks she 
will appreciate a simpler home 
page.  “The old one was hard to navi-
gate, there were too many things to notice at once,” Redfern said. 
“With so many people associated 
with the university at different facets, the [unique] tabs are a much better idea.”
  However, not everyone is 
thrilled about the changes.Desiree Sucar, 21, a nutritional sciences junior, said she was “in-different” about the new home 
page layout. 
  “I understand that we want 
things to be innovative and the 
need for change,” she said. “But I haven’t had problems with the 
old home page, so why change 
now? It might just take some get-ting used to.”

RESEARCH
  JAVIER PEÑA
 Alligator Contributing Writer
 
  The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism awarded a $2.7-million grant to UF re-searchers, who will determine whether a prescrip-tion medication can reduce alcohol consumption in 
women with HIV .
  Researchers from Florida International Universi-
ty and the University of Miami will join UF research-
ers to conduct the three-part study on the effects of Naltrexone, a prescription medication proven to re-duce alcoholic consumption.
  Hazardous drinking characterizes 12 to 22 per-
cent of women with HIV and hinders HIV patients from taking medication that can improve their 
health, said Dr. Robert Cook, an associate professor 
of epidemiology and medicine at the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions and the Col-lege of Medicine. 
  “Study after study has shown that people who 
drink are less likely to take their medication or take it on schedule,” he said.
  Cook deﬁ  ned hazardous drinking as having four 
or more drinks in one sitting or more than seven 
drinks in a week.
  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 
about 290,000 women in the United States are living 
with HIV or AIDS.  Cook said Florida is ranked second among U.S. 
states for the number of women with the disease. New York has the most women with the disease. 
  Florida is one of the best places to perform this 
type of study because of its diverse population, Cook said.
  “There are racial disparities in HIV ,” he said. 
“Florida’s important in that context.”
  Cook said about 200 women ages 18 to 60 will 
be recruited from Dade and Broward counties, two counties in Florida with the largest number of HIV patients.
  Cook said he is looking to begin recruiting pa-
tients in January 2012 for the study.
  Naltrexone has never been tested exclusively in 
women or in people infected with HIV , Cook said in UF News press release. 
  This research, Cook said, will raise awareness for 
a drug that can make a difference in patients’ lives. 
  “It could save costs and improve the quality of 
life,” he said.  UF to lead alcoholism, HIV study 
� APPROVAL IS NEEDED 
FROM THE FACULTY UNION AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

  Under a proposal UF released 
Friday, faculty would receive a 
raise but lose unused sick leave 
payouts, a measure to balance a new law requiring state employ-ees to contribute to their retire-
ment. 
  If the proposal passes, faculty 
would receive a 3 percent raise, 
offsetting the 3 percent of salary that now goes toward retirement, 
but lose payouts for unused sick 
leave.
  UF staff members have already been given a 3-percent raise.
  According to the proposal, 
which was posted to UF’s regu-
lations website, there will be no 
change to sick-leave accrual. 
  Employees will not be paid 
for any unused sick leave when 
leaving the university.
  The one exception is for 10-
year employees who were hired 
before April 2010 and will retire on or before June 30, 2016. They 
will be paid for 25 percent of un-
used sick leave up to a total of 
480 hours. 
  The year-end maximum vaca-
tion accrual for faculty would be 
reduced to 352 hours from 480 
hours, and the maximum vaca-
tion payout for faculty would be 
200 hours instead of 352.  University proposes

Line dance instructor lives with cystic ﬁ  brosis 
  MORGAN WATKINS
 Alligator Staff Writer
  As the clock counted down to midnight 
on the eve of Katelyn Sims’ 21st birthday, she 
taught a club to line dance. 
  At :08, a club in downtown Gainesville 
known for line dancing, she teaches throngs of people how to groove to the music and stay in step with the rest of the crowd. 
  Sims, a student at Santa Fe College, also 
teaches country line dancing group-ﬁ  tness classes at the UF Student Recreation and Fit-ness Center. 
  She interns for Ted Yoho, a political candi-
date running for U.S. Congress. 
  Sims also wasn’t supposed to live past the 
age of 12. 
  At ﬁ  rst, when Sims was repeatedly get-
ting sick at 4-and-a-half years old, the doctors 
thought it was pneumonia. 
  But after seeing 27 different doctors in two 
years, they came up with a new diagnosis: 
cystic ﬁ  brosis, an inherited genetic disease in which the body produces a sticky mucus that 
affects the lungs and digestive system and causes poten-tially fatal problems.
  Cystic ﬁ  brosis affects about 30,000 people 
in the U.S. and about 70,000 across the globe, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
website. 
  The thick mucus produced by the body 
can clog the lungs and cause infection, as well 
as prevent the body’s natural enzymes from 
helping in the breakdown and absorption of 
food. 
  Sims was diagnosed with the double delta 
F508 mutation of cystic ﬁ  brosis, which af-fects 50 percent of those with the disease, said Claudia Werner, executive director of the Cys-tic Fibrosis Foundation North Florida ofﬁ  ce.
  Sims has spent almost three years of her 
life in hospitals, said her mother, Leisa Sims. She missed 91 days of her senior year in high school due to health problems. 
  She takes regular tests to ensure her pul-
monary system is functioning properly. If her scores go down, she goes to the hospital for a 10- to 14-day stay to help rejuvenate her sys-tem.   The hospital trips work, usually raising 
her health in that area by 10 percent. But that doesn’t mean the stays are fun. 
  After years of sleeping in hospital beds 
and eating the cafeteria Jell-O, Sims has no 
problem telling her caretakers the way she 
works. 
  She likes to stay up all night when she’s 
in the hospital and sleep through most of the day.   
She likes the nighttime nursing staff better, 
and the schedule works for her. 
  So if doctors know what’s good for them, 
they’ll stay out of her room before 11 a.m.
  Once, a doctor came to check her health at 
5:45 a.m. 
  Sims woke up and told him to turn off the 
light and come back later. He returned at 6 
a.m. She told him to get out again. 
  When the same doctor came back early in 
the morning a day or two later, Sims threw a 
soda can at him. 
  “I warned him twice,” she said.
  Sims has surpassed doctors’ expectations 
for her lifespan, but she hasn’t remained un-
touched by the death cystic ﬁ  brosis can bring. 
  As a child, she spent a lot of time 
at Wolfson Children’s Hospital in 
Jacksonville. There were four other 
children with cystic ﬁ  brosis who fre-
quented the hospital. 
  Every time she found herself stuck 
in a hospital room for treatment, at least 
one of them was there with her.  
  Their friendship made the stays 
more bearable. They got into their fair 
share of mischief. 
  They would sneak off of their hospi-
tal ﬂ  oor, leaving one person behind to 
play lookout. 
  She and her friend Jeremy were espe-
cially close and especially mischievous. 
  “We were little hellions at that hospi-
tal,” Sims said. 
  Once, they were writing on the door 
with foam sanitizer when Jeremy decided 
to set a lighter on it. 
  The door caught on ﬁ  re. 
  With cystic ﬁ  brosis, cackling can lead to 
severe coughing. So there Sims sat, laugh-
ing and coughing as Jeremy tried to wipe 
the ﬂ  aming sanitizer off the door before any 
staff members saw them.   
  It was Easter week in 2009 and Sims was 
in the hospital when she heard the news. 
Family and friends were supposed to visit for dinner that day, but nobody came to the room, not even doctors. Someone came in to 
bring her a lunch tray and nurses checked on 
her occasionally, but that was it. 
  When a nurse came in, Sims told her, 
“Wait. What is it?”
  “Nothing,” the nurse said. And she left.  
  When her mother walked in later that day, 
she could see it on her mom’s face. 
  Sims told her not to hide the truth. That 
would just make it worse. 
  Ben had died. He was the ﬁ  rst of the ﬁ  ve 
to go.
  Sims usually fell fast asleep at the hospital. 
The night before she heard the news, she had 
the hardest time sleeping. 
  The last of her four friends died in April 
2010. 
    Sims knows her life might have an early 
expiration date because of her disease, but she doesn’t regret it. 
  “I think if I didn’t have it, I’d be a different 
person,” she said.   The disease leaves an imprint on the way 
she lives her life each day. She has to take six pills before she eats meals and between three and ﬁ  ve of them before she has a snack to keep 
her digestive system functioning properly. 
  “If not, my belly will swell up, and I’ll look 
like I’m knocked up for a couple hours,” she 
said. 
  But she also knows many opportunities 
have opened up because of her struggles with cystic ﬁ  brosis.   She’s taken advantage of those 
opportunities and given right back to the 
cause by advocating for a cure. 
  Sims has competed in pageants for most of 
her life, winning her ﬁ  rst at 2 years old. 
  In March 2009 she won the title of Straw-
berry Queen in Starke, her hometown. She helped organize a Great Strides walk, a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation fundraising program. 
  The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation wants her 
to be a national spokeswoman for the organi-
zation, but Sims wants to wait until she ﬁ  n-
ishes college. 
  She’s given speeches on her experience liv-
ing with cystic ﬁ  brosis, including one at a tail-gate for a Jacksonville Jaguars football game that she gave in front of 3,000 people. 
  “She does a lot to raise awareness, and 
she’s a ball of energy,” Werner said. “She’s 
always looking to do more. I like the fact that 
she doesn’t want to rest on her laurels.”
  After she graduates, she thinks she might 
want to be a lobbyist and ﬁ  ght for more sup-port of cystic ﬁ  brosis research. 
  She is also considering working in the 
public relations department of the Cystic Fi-brosis Foundation, where she can continue her advocacy.
  One day, if she and other supporters ﬁ  ght 
hard enough, they may even ﬁ  nd a cure to the disease that she has lived with for most of her life. 
  “We realize that there might not be a cure 
for us,” she said of other people her age or older who have the disease.
  But that doesn’t mean she shouldn’t work 
for it. 
  “If I put every effort forward, I can’t look 
back and say, ‘I wish I tried’,” she said. 
  The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has al-
ready submitted a new drug that could help 
cure a form of cystic ﬁ  brosis that affects about 
4 percent of people with the disease.
  The organization is also working on a 
treatment that could help people like Sims who have a double delta F508 mutation or 
even people with one delta F508 gene — a 
condition that affects 90 percent of the cystic ﬁ  brosis population, Werner said. 
    The foundation’s research could ultimate-
ly make it possible to halt the disease in its 
tracks, allowing young children diagnosed 
with cystic ﬁ  brosis to have a normal lifespan. 
  The treatments could help adults with cys-
tic ﬁ  brosis as well.  
  “For people like Katelyn, what we’re 
working on has the potential of stopping her disease in its tracks,” she said. “If this medi-cine that we’re working on could just sus-
pend it for her, then she could be just like she 
is forever.”

Chet Scott glared at his sword 
lying uselessly 10 feet away. His 
opponent’s blade inched closer.
Shael Millheim smirked at Scott 
and lunged her blade toward his chest.
Scott caught it with the crook of 
his elbow and gave Millheim a left cross to the cheek.
At least, that’s how it was 
planned to look.
Scott, a 22-year-old UF alum-
nus, and Millheim, a 23-year-old former UF student who moved to Gainesville from Sarasota, are part of the Thieves Guild, a group that 
performs most of the shows at the 
annual Hoggetowne Medieval Faire. The fair runs during the last week of January and the first week of February.
This weekend, members went 
to O’Leno State Park to clear their minds and prepare for the intense 
three months of practice that await 
them. The group started preparing for the fair near the beginning of the semester, but the retreat marked the start of the effort to create and memorize hours of scenes.
Members imagine histories for 
the characters they play, but the weekend is also a time for them to 
get to know each other’s real back 
stories.
Millheim got her first taste of 
medieval performance as a 9-year-
old following in her father’s foot-
steps. 
“I remember seeing my dad 
after one of the shows,” Millheim 
said, “and he knelt down, and he said, ‘Do you want to do this with 
me one day?’ and I said, ‘Yup!’”
She’s been a thief and a gypsy 
and will play Dalia the Innocent, 
a slightly deranged girl, this win-
ter. She joked that she always gets 
typecast as a crazy person.
During an improv practice 
session later that day, Millheim — or rather, Dalia the Innocent —  
squirmed while a duchess insisted 
Dalia tell her where she hid some 
expensive leather.
“Oh! I buried it!” she said, wrig-
gling in an imaginary straight jack-
et.
A few minutes later, a high-
school student strutted up to the makeshift stage — a campfire circle — and proclaimed in a pretend Scottish accent that he needed to buy a knife to fight off the English.
Brandon Cotter, a 17-year-old 
P .K. Yonge Developmental Re-search School  junior, said being a part of the Thieves Guild is a per -fect fit for him. He’s a history buff 
and has been interested in medi-
eval times since his grandmother 
handed him his first toy sword in 
his stroller.
“Most little kids pretend to be 
Spiderman or Superman and run around with a mask,” Cotter said. 
“As a little kid, I ran around with 
a sword and pretended to be St. George.”
He’s in the middle of making his 
own sword: a late-period medieval 
blade with a Viking-style handle. 
He’s only bought the bare, dull blade as of now, but he said it’s a project too exciting to pass up.He plans to attend UF and study 
history. Maybe, he said, he’ll go to law school after that, where the 
performances may lack swords but 
are a duel all the same.
He was called away from the 
improv practice to show his sword technique to one of his instructors, 
Sunshine Andrei.
He stood and waited for his turn 
while two members pretended 
to beat each other senseless for a staged fistfight.
Andrei, 36, watched the fight-
ers, noting what looked fake from the audience’s view.
She toted her 7- and 4-year-old sons while she taught Thieves Guild 
members the finer points of wield-
ing a sword or taking a hit to the 
groin. Normally she would teach 
them how to use daggers, but she’s pregnant and due in February, so moving too much is off-limits.
When she was about 7, Andrei, 
her cousin and her sister would put on plays and concerts for their family during Christmas and the Fourth of July.
Now, she won’t sing in front of 
her sister anymore, but her 17-year dedication to the Thieves Guild has led her to craft dramatic scenes year after year as the coordinator of training and safety. 
She’s also the president of the 
board of directors.
She performed at the Gainesville 
Community Playhouse before find-
ing the Thieves Guild, where she 
was introduced to sword fighting.
“I was told my face just lit up 
the first time I held the sword. You feel empowered and challenged all 
at the same time,” she said.
As for her children, she said she 
loves that they get to be around people who have different opin-
ions from their parents.
The young boys munched on 
Tostitos while a blonde woman 
kicked another member in the 
stomach. Then she pretended to 
collapse to a groin kick.
She hopped up, and Andrei 
showed her how to lock her knees in before her body collapses.
Andrei’s oldest is in Cub Scouts, 
and her youngest is taking tap, bal-let and jazz, but she said it’s up to them if they want to try stage com-
bat.
The Thieves Guild is watch-
ing them grow up, she said, 
and that’s the best part.  
Coming to a practice “almost feels 
like coming back to your extended 
family.”
Others, including Millheim, 
agree. 
“I grew up around this stuff,” she 
said. “I felt very welcomed when I moved up here. It felt like everyone was already good friends.” TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

When choosing an apartment, security 
tends to make the list of services to ask about 
before signing a lease.
Apartment complexes vary in the security 
measures they offer, but some common fea-
tures are deadbolts for apartments’ front doors 
and having law enforcement officers on prop-erty , particularly at night. 
At Cabana Beach Apartments, in addition 
to deadbolts and peepholes on the front doors, there are also four law enforcement officials who live on the property, said General Man-ager Josie Dykes. 
After 10 p.m., the back gate is locked and an 
employee stays at the front gate. If one of the front gate arms is malfunctioning, which has happened lately, personnel takes down the driver’s license numbers of guests, she said. 
Otherwise, residents can use swipe cards 
to gain access, and guests can use a database where they can input a resident’s name so that person can let them into the complex. A fatal shooting occurred at Cabana Beach 
on Oct. 20, resulting in the death of 22-year-old 
Theoderick Brown.
There are no plans to make security chang-
es in light of the recent shooting, Dykes said. 
“The two young men knew each other, and 
an argument escalated. It was an isolated inci-
dent,” she said. “Tragic, but isolated.”
The Enclave Apartments, located at the 
3000 block of SW 35th Place, also has a law en-forcement officer who lives on site who makes 
his rounds on the property to ensure safety , 
said Crystal Collins, rental manager.  
The Enclave also has security alarms in the 
apartments, although residents must choose to activate them using a phone line connection.
Due to a city ordinance, the complex can’t 
close its gates because it is located near two main roads and could cause traffic problems if it were to close them, she said. 
A woman was raped Oct. 23 at her apart-
ment at the 3000 block where the Enclave is lo-cated, but Collins said she doesn’t think there are plans to alter the complex’s security mea-sures as a result because it wasn’t any fault of the Enclave. 
Canopy Apartments, located on Southwest 
20th Avenue, has alarm systems in its apart-ments, although it handles them differently . 
The alarm system is already set up to chime 
when windows or doors are opened.
Residents can program them using a pass 
code for free if they make an appointment with Canopy, said Adrienna Sanchez, leasing 
and marketing assistant. 
Residents can set the alarms to call an agen-
cy through a third-party business, although 
Sanchez can’t recall anyone taking that option in the years that she’s worked there. 
Another security feature at Canopy is the 
complex’s policy of changing the locks of apartments’ front doors if a resident moves out or loses a key . Canopy personnel has the locks changed 
on the apartments every time new residents 
move in, but if a current resident loses a key, 
there is a charge for changing locks and mak-ing new keys for residents, Sanchez said. For a four-bedroom apartment, that fee is $60.
Like the Enclave, Canopy wasn’t able to 
have a gated entry policy due to the city ordi-nance, she said. The complex does have a law enforcement officer who works seven days a week from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
The District on 62nd, however, does include 
a gated entry requirement for its residents af-ter office hours. 
After about 6 p.m. on weekdays, residents 
can use their slide keys to open the gate to the property, said Scott Walker, community assis-tant. Guests can use a call box that is synced to residents’ cellphone numbers so they can be given access to open the gate. The gates usu-
ally remain closed on weekends. 
Residents can flip their TVs to channel 64, 
which shows a camera view of the main gate, 
to check who is asking for access to the prop-erty, he said.Security measures at apartments unchanged after crimes

Unjust immigration 
system needs reform
The country’s absolute failure to address the problem 
of illegal immigration creates messy situations all over the country. 
In Florida, college students who are U.S. citizens but 
are dependent upon noncitizen parents have to pay out-
of-state tuition. 
The Alligator recently reported a story about Wendy 
Ruiz, a college student at Miami Dade College whose par -
ents are illegal immigrants. Despite the fact that Ruiz is a 
citizen of the U.S. and Florida and was born and raised in Miami, she still has to pay out-of-state tuition.
The idea behind in-state tuition for students at public 
universities and colleges is that although you are a depen-dent, your parents pay taxes in the state, so your tuition 
rate should be subsidized over non-state residents.
But the way the law stands is simply not fair for U.S.-
born children of illegal immigrants who have no “in-state” 
options anywhere. 
A bill has been filed in the Florida state Legislature to 
change the current laws. It grants students who are chil-dren of illegal immigrant  parents in-state tuition status if they attended a Florida high school for four consecutive years and plan to enroll in college 12 months after gradu-
ation in Florida. 
Whatever your stance on illegal immigration, we should 
not be placing the blame on children who are born in the 
U.S. of undocumented parents. 
But these problems are symptomatic of a larger issue. No, repealing the 14th Amendment, which gives birth-
right citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., will not fix the problem. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, only 15 percent of illegal-immigrant mothers arrived in the U.S. 
expecting a baby.
Many of those who claim to be “tough” on immigration 
claim that they like immigrants, just those that come the 
“legal” way. Well, the legal way is tough — especially for low-skilled workers. 
According to Jason Riley of The Wall Street Journal, 
“Some 400,000 people enter the country illegally each year, a direct consequence of the fact that our current policy is to make available only 5,000 visas annually for low-skilled 
workers.”
The wait time for a low-skilled Mexican worker to ob-
tain a green card is roughly 131 years, according to the 
State Department. A computer programmer from India has to wait about 35 years, on average. 
These problems need to be addressed so that all people 
who work in this country are documented, especially be-cause the “legal” way to enter the country is completely backward. 
There needs to be comprehensive immigration reform 
in this country and fast. Otherwise, people like Ruiz will 
be punished for being the children of illegal-immigrant 
parents.
Everyday life should contain politeness
This column is going to be about tact and politeness, 
so stop reading now if those two things don’t appeal to you.
I might be channeling my inner old lady in here a bit, so 
bear with me.
If you see someone behind you while you’re opening a 
door, hold the door open for him or her. We’ve all had doors slammed in our faces, and it’s not a good feeling. Sure, it’s one thing if you didn’t bother to check around before letting the door close, but what’s even worse is when you look for other people, notice someone walking toward the door and still let it close.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Bikes have no 
business on sidewalks. They especially don’t belong there if a bike lane already exists. I understand if you’re about to pull into your destination, but cyclists who travel almost solely on the sidewalk need to change their ways. I’m tired of nearly dying every week.
This was mentioned in a previous article of mine and 
seemed to spark some debate: talking loudly in dorm hall-ways at night. Don’t do that. By all means, have your con-versation. Chat it up. Talk, giggle, console. Do what you’ve got to do. But if you are talking loudly in my hallway after a reasonable hour, and I am trying to sleep, I will come out and politely ask you to stop. And contrary to what some of you may think, that is well within my rights as an adult to do so — yes, it’s also in your rights that you may talk wherever you please. But your rights end when my sleep begins.
To put it differently, to talk loudly in the hallway after 1 
a.m. is to inhabit Chicago’s Grant Park. In this equation, I am the police carrying out Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s ordinance. Neither one of us is happy about it, but rules are rules. 
Also, they shouldn’t have kicked the actual nurses out 
of the actual Grant Park, which is my next point on polite-ness.
Hey, police departments of the cities where the Occupy protests are located: Let’s not use tear gas and such on those crowds, alright? I’m talking to you, Oak-land. You guys don’t think there are more threatening crowds to worry about in Oakland than a bunch of peaceful protesters? If you need them to leave the area, then tell them to do so.
I understand that, according to 
some reports,  the protesters threw bottles and rocks at the police officers trying to maintain the crowd. Fine, so they may have needed to be controlled. But the crowd contained children, families and Scott Olsen. Olsen received a gas can-ister to the head, which caused brain swelling and a frac-tured skull. Did I mention he was an Iraqi war veteran? 
Thank you all for serving and protecting us. I’m sure you 
do what you think is best for your cities. Just think before you throw tear gas next time.
The “being more polite” thing needs to happen in all ar -
eas of life.
I haven’t even begun my tirade on personal body odor. 
Perhaps that’s for the best, although some of you would need to read it.
Very few of you would appreciate my carefully penned 
denouncement of the meat industry. Plus, that’s gross. The meat industry is not pleasant to write about or pay attention to, so it’s best if we all just pretend that those cruelties don’t actually happen.
I could talk about how good people never ruin the end-
ings of popular books for everyone. Oh, but wait, do people still read books these days? I’m never sure about the coun-try’s stance on books.
Be extra polite to our football team, too. I hear they may 
need just a few encouraging pats on the back.

I decided this week that my dorm room was looking a little 
bland, so I went into town to purchase some wall decora-tions to enhance the ambiance. While strolling around for 
a bit in the poster shop on Main Street, trying to find a funky new art painting or a stereotypical picture of a band I liked, I 
came across a striking image — a large poster of a Cuban flag 
with the face of Ernesto “Che” Guevara drawn on the front of it.
I had seen this image before, even on Dartmouth’s campus. 
Last year, the Dartmouth Political Union used a flier combin-ing Guevara’s recognizable propaganda photo with that of President Barack Obama’s “Hope” campaign,  portraying our president as a revolutionary to rally support for Obama to align with Arab Spring rebels. Such glorification is highly 
misguided — Guevara was a Cuban revolutionary who was 
responsible for the murders of thousands of Cubans, yet stu-dents wear his portrait thinking that this insurgent was a champion of human rights and freethinking.
The poster is the exemplification of the way popular cul-
ture and modern idealism has fostered ignorance of the reality of Guevara’s life. In 1959, Fidel Castro and Guevara overthrew the regime of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, completing the Cuban Revolution. With promises to bring justice to Cubans 
and democratic ideals, Castro became the tyrannical leader of Cuba, where his regime still reigns.
According to research by the Cuba 
Archive Project, Guevara was Castro’s 
chief executioner and was appointed commander of La Cabana, the fortress 
where political prisoners were held and killed. The exact num-ber of Guevara’s victims is unknown, but he did acknowledge numerous executions — all without due process. Castro and Guevara were revered as revolutionaries yet became the origi-nators of one of the largest refugee crises in recent memory.
Despite having been a tyrant with a complete disregard for 
human life or civil rights, Guevara’s revolutionary conviction makes him an appealing figure in the eyes of ambitious “wan-nabe” revolutionaries around the world. He became a symbol 
for youthful rebellion against evil.
Nevertheless, the Bolivian government executed Guevara 
44 years ago. Had he lived 50 more years, I am confident that 
Guevara would be compared much sooner with Col. Moam-mar Gadhafi than with Obama. Retaining his tyrannical rule for nearly 42 years, Gadhafi sacrificed his citizen’s civil rights and democratic freedoms, keeping the Libyan population weak and powerless in an attempt to prevent uprisings. Last week, Gadhafi was executed by rebel troops.
During the Libyan revolution of 2011, Gadhafi and his re-gime hid behind human shields and media censorship while organizing massacres, torturing captured rebels and execut-ing his own soldiers who refused to participate. Gadhafi had become a ruthless leader, but he started his regime in Libya in a fashion similar to Guevara in Cuba — he was a talented and 
passionate revolutionary.
Why is Che Guevara glorified by our youth? His image 
is offensive to those who have personally suffered from the 
crimes of his ideology, yet it is culturally acceptable in the United States to put his face on posters and T-shirts. To think that individuals in the United States, the most well-known ex-ample of democracy and capitalism in the world, show sup-port for a totalitarian communist seems ignorant and hypo-critical.
I am not denying it is possible to admire an individual for 
his good deeds. One could state with some conviction that Guevara had respectable ideals in that he actively fought against oppressive regimes. However, he eventually became his own worst enemy when he assumed a key role in his own tyrannical creation, communist Cuba.
As students, we should make an effort to become more in-
formed of world issues, past and present.

Glorifying Che Guevara as symbol for freedom misguided  UWire
Alesy Iturrey
UWireAbout one month has passed since the 
beginning of the Occupy Wall Street protest that was led by a group of 
activists in what they say is a rally against corporate greed and social inequality.
Instead of losing stamina during the 
last few weeks, the protesters are gaining thousands of supporters across the nation, recently hitting home in Seattle. During the last two or so weeks, hundreds of Seattle protesters have lined up their tents with disregard for the city’s laws against tents in public parks.
As a result, police officers have taken to 
circling the encampment at night and wak-ing protesters up in their tents to ask them to leave. However, the protest in Seattle has remained peaceful and continues to be pur -
sued through nonviolent actions.
The Occupy Seattle protests also have drawn a diverse crowd. From families to students, the homeless to the working class, streets are filled with varied participants in this widespread movement. As larger crowds draw together, more families with 
children are seen holding signs and sleeping 
outside.
The Seattle Times interviewed Amanda 
Dorrough, an unemployed web designer, while she held her 2-month-old child after an evening spent sleeping outside. She ex-plained to reporters that she came out with her family to represent the rest of the fami-lies in our country that are struggling while 
her baby shivered in the chilly morning air.
Her commitment to the cause is noted, 
but the fact that she and other parents are 
bringing their children, many less than a year old, to sleep outside with them in the cold is ludicrous. Another signifi-
cant population of Seattle protesters worth discussing is students from the 
University of Washington. The main griev-ance students are protesting against is that they are graduating college with thousands of dollars of debt and no available jobs.
Let’s remember that this is the voice of 
the generation that was raised during a time when everyone on the team was given a tro-phy, information was found at a click of a button and grades were the teacher’s fault 
and not their own.
Life is about saving money for college, 
doing well in school to earn scholarships, 
attending an affordable university, working jobs that pay minimum wage and living be-low your means.This not only goes for the bickering col-
lege students in Seattle but also for the population of unemployed adults as well. Finding out that you are financially unstable does not mean that you reserve the right to 
blame the government and big business for 
your problems. It means that it is time to sell your new car, to not purchase the latest ver -
sion of the iPhone and to resist the habit of buying Starbucks every morning. 
As for the future plans of the Seattle pro-
tests, only time will tell how the Seattle pro-tests will pan out. But while we wait, it is time that a new message surfaces concern-
ing the Occupy Wall Street protests, which is 
this: being a part of the 99 percent is a choice, not a fate. The decision of where you fall is up to you.

Dupont said he will try to maintain the pa-
per’s website for as long as possible, desper -
ate not to lose eight years of the community’s 
digital archives.Founded in 1952, the paper 
was formerly known as the High Springs Her -
ald and covers Florida’s “crescent communi-
ties”: Alachua, Newberry , High Springs, Fort White, Gilchrist County and Jonesville.
“What bothers me the most is that people 
often say newspapers are the first rough draft of history. Out here, the Herald is often the only draft of history,” he said. “I’ve been cry-
ing for three days about this decision.”
A reader who called in to put an event in 
the paper burst into tears when Dupont told 
her the last issue of the weekly paper was al-ready on the stands.
Past interns cried when they heard, re-
membering Dupont’s dedication to his writers and his community.
“It was one of the best internships I’ve ever 
had,” said Annie Quintana, a 21-year-old jour -
nalism senior who interned with the Herald in Spring 2010 and went on to internships with the Miami Herald and TMZ. “I learned every-
thing from Ron.”
Aside from reporting about birthday par -
ties, block parties, anniversaries, local elec-
tions and businesses that will be lost, Dupont said he is also concerned about the businesses that will no longer be able to advertise.
“Where are they going to go now to tell 
people about their sales or specials?” he said. “I just don’t have an easy answer for them.”
The communities aren’t the only ones who 
have suffered.Dupont started taking pay cuts as the pa-
per’s outlook continued to deteriorate. He cut 
his salary in half, then stopped taking one all 
together.His house was tied into his purchase of the paper in 2009 — an asset that he will now likely lose.
Readers have started a “Save Our Her -
ald” Facebook group in an effort to raise the $120,000 needed to keep the paper going for another year, the type of community support for which, Dupont said, he is very grateful.
“At this point we need a financial angel to 
save us,” he said. “All we can do is hope.”8, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2011

When Kimberly Vacca walks into a room, 
she searches faces. She looks for anyone with 
dark skin and blue eyes. She knows it sounds crazy , but there could be a chance that they are related to her. 
Her mother, Kathy , chose her father, a 
sperm donor, because of his blue eyes. 
Vacca, a UF sustainability and the built 
environment sophomore, is one of tens of thousands of children born through artificial insemination in 1992. An estimated 30,000 and 60,000 children are born per year through sperm donation, according to The New York Times. 
However, those figures have been in de-
cline in the last 10 years. Recently, egg dona-tion has risen in popularity . 
While UF does not have a sperm bank, it 
does offer egg donation.
The first successful egg donation proce-
dure was done in Australia in 1983, but UF Reproductive Medicine has been practicing it for about 15 years, said Dr. Alice Rhoton-
Vlasak, a clinical associate professor in the UF 
College of Medicine’s division of reproduc-tive endocrinology and infertility . 
The ideal candidate is a healthy woman 
between the ages of 21 and 30. The potential donor gets a physical and is screened for in-
fections and diseases, said Kevin Bishop, do-
nor egg program coordinator at UF. 
Donating eggs is a six- to eight-week com-
mitment. 
Women have to start on a specific birth-
control pill for about three weeks. They also have to inject and take daily medicine to stimulate egg production. While the egg re-moval process only takes about an hour, it 
takes about two to three weeks for a woman’s cycle to return to normal.  
Women are compensated because the process is ex-tensive. At UF, women are paid $3,000. 
Last year 15 women 
were impregnated by do-
nor eggs at UF, and 12 of 
them became successfully pregnant, accord-
ing to UF Reproductive Medicine. 
The process has a high success rate, but 
there are ethical issues surrounding the pro-cess of third-party reproduction. 
For example, all Vacca knows about her bi-
ological father is that he is 5-foot-11-inches tall and is Australian, Danish and Colombian. 
“I don’t feel like I missed out on not know-
ing my biological father,” Vacca said. “But I can’t ever know if I did.”UF program taking egg donors

The number of medical school students 
in the United States is on the rise, but that 
doesn’t necessarily mean there will be more doctors.
According to data from the Associa-
tion of American Medical Colleges, 19,230 students were admitted to medical school in 2011, a number that has been steadily increasing since 2001. 
There was also an increase in total ap-
plicants to medical schools. This year, 43,919 students applied for admission, the most in a decade, according to the associa-tion’s press release.
UF has seen a similar trend.The College of Medicine has main-
tained its class size, with 135 available spots each year; however, it saw about an 8 percent increase in the number of appli-cations received in 2011.
Ira Gessner, former chair of the College 
of Medicine’s admissions committee, said the increased number of medical students can largely be attributed to new medical schools that have opened. Since 2009, three Florida universities have opened colleges of medicine: the University of Central Florida, Florida Atlantic University and 
Florida International University.
Gessner said it is important to keep in 
mind that more medical students doesn’t 
mean more doctors, it just means more graduates from medical school. To cre-ate more doctors, there would have to be more residency programs — a require-ment for certification as a doctor.
Though Florida now has nine medical 
schools, the number of residency spots has not increased.
“Most individuals end up staying and 
working where they do their residency , not where they went to medical school,” Gessner said. “So are we going to get more doctors in Florida? That remains to be seen.”Medical school applicant,

Artrel Dubose came to Gainesville to at-
tend the funeral of a family member. 
But a confrontation that turned violent 
early in the morning of Oct. 23 left him lying 
on the second floor of a city-owned parking 
garage suffering from what would become 
a fatal gunshot to the head. 
Police believe the gun used in the shoot-
ing, which was originally missing, may have been found near the Alachua County Courthouse Friday when a Jimmy John’s deliveryman saw something shiny when he parked his bicycle, said Cpl. Angelina Valuri, Gainesville Police Department pub-
lic information officer.
Further inspection showed it was a hand-
gun buried under a pile of leaves. The .40-
caliber Beretta was sent to the Florida De-partment of Law Enforcement for analysis.
Roderick Harris, of Lake City, was an unknown suspect at the time of the shoot-ing and has been found. He is now a witness to the crime, Valuri said. No charges have been filed against him. 
Police arrested two men, Brandon 
Brashod Wilson and Deron Matthews, the morning of the shooting. Both men are from 
Lake City. Wilson, 20, has been charged 
with homicide and burglary, and Matthews, 22, has been charged with burglary.
This isn’t the first time someone has been 
shot in the head in this particular parking garage. In November 2007, Andrew Arose-mena, 23, died after he was shot in the head after the UF vs. Florida State University football game, Valuri said. 
Okpara K. Nelson, of Gainesville, who 
was  convicted of the murder in a 2009 trial, shot Arosemena in the head after he yelled out of his car for Nelson to move, said Law-rence J. Marraffino, a Gainesville attorney who represented Arosemena’s mother, Pa-tricia Kelleher, in a civil suit against the city of Gainesville about the crime. 
Nelson is now serving two consecutive 
life sentences in state prison.
Kelleher sued the city for negligence in 
her son’s death.
In court proceedings, records from the 
Alachua County Clerk of the Court’s office 
stated Kelleher provided the following tes-
timony:
“As parents, you never think that you 
will not outlive your kids. Oh, God. And you expect that — you don’t expect that one of your children will die first, especially murdered. You know it’s not the way it’s supposed to happen. And the pain it causes is the rawest kind. And it doesn’t stop, no 
matter how much time goes by.”
A jury handed down a verdict stating  
the city was not guilty.
Marraffino said the city focused on the is-
sue of how it could prevent the murder after 
the crime happened. He said the city should have taken a preventative approach.
Marraffino is working on another case 
regarding violence at the same parking 
garage, this one for an incident in August 
2007 — just months before Arosemena was killed.
In the August case, then-26-year-old Mat-
thew P . Johnson stepped into the garage’s driving lane to allow a friend to back his car out, he said. A person got out of another ve-hicle and hit him hard enough to send him face first into the concrete floor. 
Multiple surgeries to fix his broken facial 
bones racked up $87,000 in medical bills. No one was charged in the incident, he said. 
Some scars remain, according to Mar -
raffino.
The case is set to start on Nov. 7 in civil 
court.
Marraffino said he knew the Arosemena 
incident wouldn’t be the last violent crime that would be committed in that parking garage.
“I said in my final argument, ‘This is go-
ing to happen again.’ Little did I know that it was only going to take two weeks,” he said. “And it makes me sick. It’s a case where you don’t want to be right.” TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 9

On Oct. 23, Artrel Dubose, 30, suffered a fatal gunshot to the head in the downtown 
parking garage on Southwest Second Street.
Third suspect found in garage shooting case
ASSOCIATED PRESS
SARASOTA, Fla.
Lego Man is going to stay in po-
lice custody for three months.
Lego Man, a 100-pound, 8-foot-
tall sculpture, didn’t do anything 
except wash up on a Florida beach. 
Sarasota County Sheriff Tom 
Knight said his office will hold the fiberglass sculpture for 90 days “just 
like all other lost and found prop-
erty,” according to 
state law. 
During that 
time, authorities 
will try to deter -
mine who the own-
er is.
The giant sculp-
ture designed to look like a Lego 
toy mysteriously appeared on a Si-esta Key beach Tuesday. 
Its green shirt read “No Real 
Than You Are,” along with “Ego Leonard” and the number 8. 
The Sarasota Herald-Tribune re-
ported that the local tourism bureau had hoped to use Lego Man to pro-mote the area, but the sheriff says 
Lego Man needs to remain in police 
custody a little longer.
A Legoland recently opened in 
Winter Haven, which is about 70 miles northwest of Siesta Key.8-foot-tall 
Lego Man

custody

Running back Chris Rainey (1) is attended to by multiple trainers during Saturday’s loss to Georgia while coach Will Mus-
champ (right) looks on. Rainey injured his right ankle early in the ﬁ  rst quarter but returned in the second quarter. 
  TYLER JETT
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Redshirt senior running back Chris Rainey’s right foot 
was in a protective boot Monday , multiple sources close 
to the team said.
  Rainey suffered a right ankle injury with 10:21 left 
in the ﬁ  rst quarter Saturday against Georgia. After los-
ing three yards on a run to his left, Rainey stayed on the 
ground, holding his leg. He returned in the second quarter and ﬁ  nished with 94 all-purpose yards.
  Rainey leads the Gators in rushing yards (526), receiv-
ing yards (305) and all-purpose yards (1,009) this season. 
  Coach Will Muschamp did not name Rainey in his in-
jury report Monday morning, and a team spokesman de-clined comment.
  Muschamp has been ambigu-
ous about injuries all season. After quarterback John Brantley suffered a right ankle sprain against Ala-
bama on Oct. 1, for example, Muschamp said the quarter-back was out with a “lower leg” injury.
  Muschamp updated the status of several other players 
Monday , however.   
  Brantley “seems to be ﬁ  ne.” Cornerback Cody Riggs 
(wrist) is probable. Kicker Caleb Sturgis (right leg) and line-
backer Lerentee McCray (undisclosed) are questionable.
  Muschamp hopes to have running back Mike Gillislee 
(ankle) and right tackle Chaz Green (right ankle) back 
in practice by Wednesday. Cornerback Jeremy Brown (sprained knee) will not practice this week. He has been out since the ﬁ  rst week of training camp.
  Also, linebacker Jon Bostic dislocated the ring ﬁ  nger on 
his right hand while trying to sack Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray on Saturday. Sources: Rainey dealing with injury after loss to Georgia
  Will Muschamp has lied to us 
before, but Monday’s ﬁ  b was his biggest yet. 
  He has been blatantly misleading 
about injuries — said players who were obviously hurt would be playing and announced that players had practiced all week only to amend those comments postgame. 
  But none of that tops how patently 
dishonest he was when asked to evalu-ate junior left tackle Xavier Nixon’s play. 
  “Xavier has played well for us.”  No. No, he hasn’t. And it’s not just 
him, either. 
  The entire offensive line, with the 
possible exception of center Jonotthan Harrison, struggled mightily against Georgia on Saturday. 
  The Gators allowed six sacks. Nixon was respon-sible for three, right tackle Matt Patchan was respon-sible for two and sopho-more guard Jon Halapio 
was responsible for one. 
  But, to hear Muschamp tell it, none 
of those players was responsible for those plays. 
  Senior quarterback John Brantley 
held the ball too long, and with his ankle injury he could barely move. To make matters worse, UF receivers con-tinued to show an inability to get open, which tied in to how long Brantley was forced to hold on to the ball. Don’t believe Muschamp; 
offensive line is offensive

  The difference between Florida’s rushing 
attack in September and October has been just 
like that of the team’s record those months — 
night and day.
  Through the ﬁ  rst third of the season, Florida 
averaged 259 rushing yards per game, includ-ing a season-high 405 yards against Kentucky. But during the team’s four-game skid, the Gators have amassed just 175 total yards on the 
ground. 
  “I’ve said it before, and they get tired of 
hearing me say it: We’ve got to ﬁ  nd ways to run the football,” coach Will Muschamp said 
Monday.
  Florida’s struggles the last month were high-
lighted by a negative-19-yard output against the Bulldogs on Saturday, when the Gators failed to pick up a ﬁ  rst down on the ground.
  The inability to run the ball during their last four games, when the team has averaged just 43.75 yards per contest, has dropped the 
Gators’ rushing offense to 66th in the nation at 
151.38 yards per game. After beating Kentucky , Florida was ranked ninth in the country.
  “My experience in this league, there’s no 
question that in order to win in this league … 
you’ve got to be able to run the ball when you 
need to,” Muschamp said. “Whether it’s end-ing the game, whether it’s in the red zone, short 
yardage, goal line, there’s some critical times in 
the game you’re going to need to run the foot-ball.”
  That’s a lesson Muschamp said he learned as 
an assistant at LSU and Auburn. While a defen-sive coordinator at those schools, Muschamp 
saw his teams’ offenses consistently ﬁ  nish in 
the top half of the Southeastern Conference in   Gators running game sagging 
after dismal October showingUF Fo otball
“I’ve said it before, and they get 
tired of hearing me say it: We’ve got 
to ﬁ  nd ways to run the football.”

GAMES LAST SEASON.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Writer
Watching from the sideline 
was a tough adjustment for Kayla 
Lewis.
Lewis struggled with injuries 
last season, missing 19 games due 
to multiple leg injuries.
The kicker was a stress fracture 
in her right fibula, which sidelined 
Lewis for UF’s final 14 games.
“Just look at what our team 
lacked without her,” Florida coach Amanda Butler said. “She plays up around the rim, can be very dy-namic and explosive, and you also 
add a 3-point shot to that collection 
of athletic traits.”
Florida was 8-6 during the 
stretch without Lewis, including a brutal four-game losing streak in Southeastern Conference play.
“It was my first time ever hav-
ing a season-ending injury, so that was tough to sit and watch, 
but I learned a lot,” Lewis said. “I 
learned a lot mentally to watch my team and become a better cheer -
leader.”

was unfamiliar territory for Lewis, but if her start to the season proved anything, it was that she adapts quickly.
The Gators added seven new 
players to the fold last season, and Lewis stood out early.
She performed well enough to 
earn a starting spot in Florida’s de-but last year, a 77-67 victory against UCF in the  Preseason Women’s National Invitation Tournament.
Lewis had a solid outing with 
nine points, six rebounds and three blocks. More importantly, she be-came the first true freshman to start a season opener for UF since former guard Sha Brooks in 2005-06. 
“She’s very, very bright, a quick 
learner, picked up on things,” But-ler said, “and that has as big an im-pact as any when a freshman has an opportunity to have a role — a big role, a starting role — at the be-
ginning of the season.”
Florida hopes Lewis will once 
again display her versatility as she 
moves to power forward.
Butler believes Lewis’ “unique-
ness” and her experience on the perimeter will be beneficial to the Gators’ play in the paint, which lacked offensive punch last season.
“She wanted to play [power for -
ward],” Butler said. “She’s meeting a need, giving us some more depth and a little bit more versatility in our post group.”
Regardless of how her role pans 
out this season, Lewis is just happy to be back on the court.
“I’m just trying to be a chame-
leon right now,” Lewis said. “I’m just blending in wherever they put me, trying to get some minutes and play.”16, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2011

The Gators left Maryville, Tenn., with pride, contentment and 
hope.
The only thing they were missing was a Southeastern Confer -
ence Championship trophy.
Florida’s men were runners-up to Arkansas on Monday . This 
year’s second-place finish by the men was their best performance 
since 2007, when they also fell short of the Razorbacks. 
After a predicted third-place finish at the beginning of the sea-
son, the Gators said they were pleased with nearly capturing their first conference championship in 24 years.
While the men exceeded preseason expectations, the women 
were dethroned as SEC champions. Vanderbilt and Arkansas pushed the Gators into settling for bronze. 
A third-place finish rather than a third consecutive champion-
ship dismayed no one as much as senior Genevieve LaCaze.
“Obviously, we are a little disappointed with the team finish,” 
LaCaze said. “I know on another day we are better than that, but I also know every girl went out there and worked as hard as they 
could today.”
Three Florida women finished in the top 10, including a third-
overall finish by LaCaze. Unfortunately for the women, the top 
five runners accumulate points, and UF’s Nos. 4 and 5 runners 
could not boost their team to the top as they finished 20th and 24th, respectively.
In nearly an exact same situation, the men placed their top three 
runners in the top 10 while the other two runners finished 25th and 27th, respectively. However, unlike the women, that result gar -
nered a second-overall finish and a well-pleased group of men. 
“It was good all the way around,” coach Todd Morgan said. 
“We just tried to put the pressure on and see if we could make 
something happen. We gave it our best shot today.”
Sophomore Mark Parrish, who finished third overall, even 
went as far to say the Gators performance was amazing.
Officially marking the beginning of the championship cross 
country season, the SEC meet was a good rebound from the disap-
pointing results in Wisconsin two weeks ago. The Gators believe their finishes at their conference meet will translate into success na-tionally as they head into the NCAA South Regional on Nov. 12.
“It’s a finish we deserve because we worked really hard,” Parrish 
said. “We’re really fit and we are looking forward to big things.”Men finish second, 
women third at SECs
