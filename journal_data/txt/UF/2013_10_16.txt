� IT WAS THE FIRST 
EXECUTION BY A NEW DRUG.

STARKE — “Lord, hear our 
prayer,” sang a group of activists as 
they stood before the Florida State 
Prison on Tuesday evening. Rain clouds loomed over the prison as more than 40 people gathered to protest the lethal injection of death-row inmate William Happ.
Happ has been on death row for 
24 years for the abduction, rape and murder of 21-year-old Angie Crow-
ley in 1986.
The execution was the ﬁ  rst to use 
midazolam hydrochloride, usually a 
sedation drug, Reuters reported.
When the clock struck 6 p.m., the 
scheduled time of Happ’s execution, 
protesters took turns ringing a bell 
while chanting phrases like “Stop killing people — kill violence.”
“We are here to stop the death 
penalty, and that is exactly what we will do,” said 27-year-old Kurt Wadsworth Jr., a former University of West Florida student who spent the last four months protesting capi-tal punishment.
Wadsworth puts the situation 
into perspective by thinking of his brother, whom he visits in prison.
“I would never want my brother 
to die, regardless of what he’s done,” he said.
George Diller, a 73-year-old UF  
French prose professor, also pro-tested.
“I just started thinking about 
what a barbaric act this is,” he said. “In my opinion, life without parole is a perfectly adequate punishment.”Protesters argue execution in StarkeALEX HARRIS

Noam Chomsky, a prominent politi-
cal activist and respected Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology linguistics profes-sor, was met with a standing ovation both before and after his speech Tuesday night.
Chomsky spoke to a packed crowd of 
about 1,700 people in the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
His talk, “Policy and the Media Prism,” 
was the start of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Civic Media Center. 
The Civic Media Center brought Chom-
sky  to Gainesville last time, too — for its 10th anniversary.
The 84-year-old drew on his many years 
of academia to comment on a host of hot-button issues, including the Palestinian-Is-raeli conﬂ  ict, Syria and Edward Snowden. 
His talk highlighted the differences be-
tween the mainstream media coverage of these issues and alternative views.“What’s being presented to the public 
is a version of reality,” said Chomsky of these issues. “It doesn’t allow the public to participate meaningfully in the discussion, and it should not be tolerated.”
Chomsky made many references to the 
U.S. being a “rogue state,” which relies on “the passive assumption that we have the right to be a rogue state and to rule the world by force.”
Joe Courter, director of the Civic Media 
Center, called the event “wonderful”.Chomsky tackles media controversies in UF speech

A new Yiddish language 
course will be offered in the 
Spring, making UF the ﬁ  rst 
Florida university to offer a 
class in the traditional Europe-an-Jewish language.
Dror Abend-David, a He-
brew literature and language professor and instructor for the Yiddish course, said the course will cover Yiddish lan-guage, history and culture.
“It will cover the basics of 
the language but also contex-tualize it and create an entire cultural experience from a lan-
guage that is not being given 
as much attention as it could be,” Abend-David said.
The course is funded by the 
Center for European Studies 
and supported by the Depart-
ment of Languages, Literature and Culture, and the Center 
for Jewish Studies, Abend-
David said.
“I teach Hebrew, and one 
of the students asked me, ‘Well, why don’t you teach 
Yiddish?’” Abend-David said. 
“I said, ‘I don’t know. We should. We will.’”
Abend-David said the 
course will be offered as a gen-
eral topics course that should 
fulﬁ  ll language requirements, but students hoping to use the 
course to fulﬁ  ll a language re-
quirement should talk to their academic advisers.
The course is targeted to-
ward beginners and begin-ning-intermediate students of Yiddish, but intermediate and 
advanced classes could be cre-
ated in the coming years, ac-cording to a UF news release.
“Yiddish is this ancestral 
language — the language of folktales, of memories, of any-thing from superstition to sec-ular culture,” Abend-David said. “I think one of the major 
differences between Yiddish 
and Hebrew in the United States is that Yiddish has a tre-mendous emotional appeal.”

of the Jewish Student Union, said he thinks many Jewish Gators to schmooze

Senate President Cory Yeffet, who replaced Lauren Verno, helps lead the ﬁ  rst installment of the new 
senator orientation series prior to Tuesday night’s Student Senate meeting.
� THE DISABILITIES AFFAIRS 
CABINET GOT A DIRECTOR.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Staff Writer cwright@alligator.com
As the pomp from election 
season settled, new Student Sena-
tors eased into their new term by 
learning the Senate basics.
Information and Communi-
cations Committee chairwoman 
Jamie Lowstetter led the ﬁ  rst 
session of the Senate orientation 
series prior to Tuesday night’s meeting. 
The next two sessions will 
discuss parliamentary procedure 
and legislative writing.
The ﬁ  rst session covered all 
six Senate committees in hopes of 
generating applications for open 
seats.
“We had a great turnout at the 
ﬁ  rst meeting,” Lowstetter said. “We got some good questions 
from new senators.”
The ﬁ  rst two meetings for new 
senators were softballs: no bill readings, no intense public de-bate, no bills pending signatures. Tuesday’s highlight was Jillian 
Roberts’ appointment as the Dis-
abilities Affairs Cabinet director.
During the meeting, seasoned 
senators gave their best wishes to 
rookie senators.
Sen. Michael Filipelli advised 
them to listen to older senators.
“It really is a rewarding ex-
perience to be in these chambers and make a difference,” he said.
Newly elected District C Sen. 
Andre Nunes said he was still 
getting used to the procedures 
but found the orientation meet-
ing to be very informative.
“I can’t wait to start leaving 
my mark on Senate and making a positive change,” he said.New senators welcomed

“Hebrew we grew up hearing in syna-
gogues and whatnot, but it’s Yiddish that our grandparents are yelling at us from across the house,” said Sharfstein, a 20-year-old UF phi-losophy sophomore.
Abend-David said it’s a language of per-
sonal history because grandparents speak it.  
“In that case, I am hoping that it will fulfill 
a very sentimental role,” he said. 
Jared Kaplan, a 20-year-old UF biochemis-
try and psychology sophomore, said he thinks the class will also appeal to other students who may not be familiar with Jewish culture.
“When you’re learning a language, you’re 
not just learning a language, you’re learning about the culture itself,” Kaplan said. “It gives you a different perspective on other cultures 
and a different way of thinking about things, 
in their own native tongue.”
Abend-David said intellectually, there is a 
lot to be gained by teaching Yiddish.
“It’s a very colorful, varied course,” Abend-
David said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2013

Although the Hough Graduate School of Business was 
recently ranked by Forbes as a top national business school, 
students and faculty still see room for improvement.
Forbes put together the list of the top MBA programs in 
the U.S. earlier this month, and UF’s graduate business pro-
gram is ranked at No. 63 out of 70.
Brian Gendreau, a professor with the Hough program, 
said it is difficult to form an opinion based on Forbes’ rank-
ing. He said although the school needs to improve its ranking with Forbes, it is doing a lot of things right.
“Florida’s business school programs are very rich. We at-
tract high-quality faculty and high-quality students,” he said.
According to the Forbes website, Hough alumni have an 
average of 87 percent employment after graduation, a me-dian base salary of $75,000 and a median signing bonus of $10,000.
Out of all the schools Randa Medley applied and was ac-
cepted to, she chose UF because of its reputation for academ-ics and is thrilled with the ranking.
Medley, a 20-year-old UF graduate student in interna-
tional business, said although UF didn’t make the top 10, she thinks the ranking could still help her land a better job in an extremely competitive job market.
“It makes me feel proud to be a student here and that I have 
the opportunity I’ve been given to study here,” she said. “The ranking shows me that I’m getting a quality education.”
Craig Petrus, the director of graduate business career ser-
vices at Hough, said he hopes for the school to partner with 
more Fortune 500 companies located nationally in order to 
raise the ranking. 
“I think that any time the Hough business program is 
ranked nationally with other elite business schools, it is a good thing for the program,” Petrus said.Locals: Forbes ranking means school should get down to business

The Center for Leadership and Service’s 
first Social Impact Week begins today, of-
fering a series of events to teach students how to address social issues.
There will be different events each day 
through Oct. 31, including documentary screenings, guest speakers and discussions on controversial topics such as gay mar-riage and anti-bullying.
Social Impact Week will focus on mak-
ing students more socially responsible, said Angela Garcia, director for commu-nity engagement and service-learning for the center.
“Part of (being socially responsible) is 
understanding the social issues that face your community,” Garcia said.
Garcia said the center created Social 
Impact Week so different socially minded events can merge together around the same time.Events will be hosted by departments 
and organizations such as the Bob Graham Center for Public Service, the Institute of 
Black Culture and the Baha’i Association.
Maddie McClinton, a 19-year-old UF 
elementary education sophomore, said she 
is looking forward to the two-day Gator Global Initiative conference.
“Hearing others’ passions reassures 
me there are individuals, even right here at UF, that will create a change for the bet-ter,” McClinton wrote in an email.

bassadors for the Center for Leadership and Service, said Social Impact Week is important to students because the events provide an opportunity for them to be ed-ucated on social issues.Events encourage students to get social
Some UF students called 
Chomsky’s speech unfair, but others found it neutral 
“Just seeing how many people were 
there and how happy they were to be 
there, not only to see Chomsky but to 
see that large of an audience, was re-
ally a powerful thing,” he said.
However, UF students like Raya 
Elias-Pushett, a 19-year-old anthropol-
ogy sophomore, called Chomsky con-
troversial. 
She said she found some of his char-
acterizations, particularly of the Mid-
dle East conflict and the U.S. involve-
ment, unfair.
“I think that he focused too much on 
what is neglected in the media and not enough on how facts are presented, pe-
riod,” she said. “I think that his point 
of view, although academic and re-spected because of his previous work, is not necessarily the most accurate or the most nonbiased.”
Anusha Hudda, an 18-year-old UF  
pre-nursing freshman, agreed that Chomsky’s opinions were thought-provoking, if not entirely neutral.
“Even though we could tell what 
side he was on, and what he was trying to accomplish with the speech, it was nice to hear a different side,” Hudda  said.
Ryan Dargan, an 18-year-old UF  
mechanical engineering freshman, said Chomsky’s views should be taken with a grain of salt.
“He definitely brought up a lot of 
great, thought-provoking points that kind of opened my eyes in a sense,” he said. “A lot of it though, you have to take it that it’s just his opinions.”ChomSKy , from page 1oy , from page 1Older relatives

Step aside, Panda Cam — three live streaming web cameras 
have been added to the Florida Museum of Natural History’s But-
terfly Rainforest exhibit.
“Basically, it’s viewable to the world now,” said Paul Ramey, 
museum spokesman.
Ryan Fessenden, assistant manager of Butterfly Rainforest op-
erations, said the chrysalis cam gives viewers the chance to see butterflies and moths emerging from their cocoons. The second camera focuses on a fruit tray, and the third canopy cam is placed about 30 feet in the air, which gives “a much broader bird’s-eye view of the rainforest.”
Marissa Rios, a 20-year-old UF wildlife ecology and conserva-
tion junior, sees them as good for people who live far away.
Ramey said when the cameras were first put up, they did not 
work with any Android devices, and they still don’t work with all operating systems. He said a patron could also use the cameras to see the weather in Gainesville before deciding to visit.
Fessenden said the weather plays an important role in the 
amount of flight activity. The cooler the temperatures are outside, 
the less action. He said a downside with the cameras is that if the 
weather is bad, visitors might not choose to come.

SnapHack Pro, an app that allows users to save Snapchats, was released Monday. The app does not 
notify Snapchat senders that recipients have saved their videos and images.
� IT COSTS $1.99 IN THE 
APPLE APP STORE.

Watch out, Snapchat users: 
There’s a new way for recipients to 
save embarrassing photos sent over the popular disappearing-picture messaging application.
SnapHack Pro, released Mon-
day, is a new iPhone app that al-lows users to save picture and video messages without the sender ever knowing. The unafﬁ  liated app is a departure from Snapchat’s of-ﬁ  cial function, which informs users if recipients have taken screenshots of pictures that were sent.
“The question is going to be: 
Does the person have a reasonable expectation of privacy when they sent that photo?” said Jon Mills, a professor at the UF Levin College of Law and author of the book “Pri-vacy: The Lost Right.”
Snapchat’s popularity stemmed 
from the idea of allowing recipients 
to view pictures or videos for a cer-
tain number of seconds before they disappear, but SnapHack isn’t shy about subverting this mission.
“Save your Snapchats to your 
camera roll without the sender 
knowing and view them as many 
times as you like!” reads the app’s description.
SnapHack Pro, which costs $1.99 
in the Apple App Store, allows us-ers to log in with their Snapchat username and password and re-trieve any picture or video message sent to them as many times as they 
wish.
Snapchat users have expressed 
concern with the new app.
“If you can screenshot it without 
me knowing, I think that violates 
the integrity of Snapchat,” said Francie Weinberg, a 21-year-old UF public relations senior.
Clay Calvert, director of the Mar-
ion B. Brechner First Amendment Project at UF, said anyone who uses technology should assume the information is being stored.
“People who use Snapchat are 
probably a little bit naïve to think that somebody out there on the oth-er end is not actually able to save the photographs,” Calvert said. “If 
it’s not something you wouldn’t 
want your mother to see, you prob-ably shouldn’t be posting it.”Old Snapchats could haunt users with new iPhone appKRISTAN WIGGINS

Due to legal loopholes on both federal 
and state levels, unpaid interns can’t sue 
for sexual harassment from employers. But that could change with attention a recent case is attracting, UF experts say.
The issue took national spotlight 
when a woman in New York ﬁ  led a law-suit against her former company, claim-ing her boss sexually harassed her. 
The judge presiding over the case 
said she had no right to sue because she did not qualify as an employee — she was not being paid for her work.
The issues aren’t restricted to New 
York. Oregon is the only state where un-paid interns can actually sue for sexual harassment, USA Today reported this week.
Robert Emerson, a professor at the 
UF business school, said the judge’s de-cision was not a shock.
“I don’t think it’s surprising given the 
statute and the legislation,” he said. “A lot of judges are reluctant to craft rem-edies or rights that go beyond the literal wording of a statute or regulation. They 
feel like that’s not their role.”
Joseph Little, an emeritus professor 
at the UF Levin College of Law, also 
thought the judge had valid reasoning to throw the case out based on the law that was in place.
He did, however, say he was wary of 
the deﬁ  nition of an employee.
“The thing I would probably dis-
agree with is the conclusion that under the circumstance, the intern was not an employee,” he said.
Maya Halaly, an 18-year-old UF 
animal sciences freshman, said the law should be changed to not have payment in the deﬁ  nition of an employee.
“Everyone has human rights, and 
you’re still an employee even if you 
don’t get paid,” she said. “Harassment 
is still harassment.”
Both Emerson and Little discredited 
the idea that the loophole was meant to beneﬁ  t or protect businesses. 
Some of the laws the judge in the New 
York case referenced when making this 
decision are decades old, including the 
federal Title VII of the Civil Rights Act that expanded employee rights in 1964, according to court documents.
But companies can still have a vested 
interest in these cases, Emerson said. 
Even if companies aren’t required 
to pay interns, giving interns the legal grounds to sue is a risk that manage-
ment isn’t likely to promote.
“If you start giving more rights to 
people — interns and others — it’s one 
more drag on perhaps having internship programs in the ﬁ  rst place,” Emerson said.
But Alexandra Steele, an 18-year-old 
UF biology freshman, said she expects the laws to progress quickly with the 
changing times.
“The number of interns are increas-
ing,” she said, “and awareness of sexual 
harassment is also growing, so I expect things to change quickly.”
Halaly and Steele both said they 
would quit if they were ever harassed as 
an intern, but they wouldn’t stop there.
“I would try to ﬁ  ght until that is 
ﬁ  xed,” Steele said.
Looking forward, Emerson said he 
expects legislators to tighten up the laws 
regarding interns.
“It’s an interesting case, and hope-
fully maybe something will change in terms of the law because of publicity of 
cases like this,” he said.

But he misses the 
point about the lack 
of diversity on “SNL”
During the early years of “Saturday Night Live”’s run, the 
environment was not friendly to women or minorities. This is made abundantly clear in both the book “Live 
From New York” and interviews with former female writers and cast members such as Jane Curtin.
“We all saw it,” she said in an interview with Vulture in 
2011, “and it was just overwhelmingly rude, the treatment of the women writers, and just unnecessary.”
Many former cast members have spoken out on how the 
higher-ups within the show and the network were dismissive of both women’s and minority persons’ sketch ideas, and if you happened to be a woman of color — forget it. Even today, only three of the 16 cast members on “SNL” are minorities.
While you’d think cast members of color would advocate 
for more diversity on the show, Kenan Thompson implied in an interview with TV Guide on Monday that the lack of black female cast members was due to a lack of talented black female comedians. Um, has he not seen Wanda Sykes, Retta, Mo’Nique or Jessica Williams from “The Daily Show”?
“It’s just a tough part of the business,” Thompson said. “Like 
in auditions, they just never ﬁ  nd ones that are ready.”
“In the 38 years ‘SNL’ has been on the air, the series has only 
had four black female cast members: Yvonne Hudson (1980-
81), Danitra Vance (1985-86), Ellen Cleghorne (1991-95) and 
Maya Rudolph (2000-2007),” TV Guide reporter Sadie Gennis wrote. “Of the four, only three were repertory players (Hudson was only a featured player before being ﬁ  red midseason). This means, there were large gaps in ‘SNL’’s history when there were no black women on the show at all.”
Jay Pharoah, the other black male cast member, has spoken 
up about the show’s need for black female comics.
“They need to pay attention,” he said, according to TV Guide, 
and even named black actress Darmirra Brunson as a potential addition to the cast.
“Why do I think she should be on the show? Because she’s 
black ﬁ  rst of all, and she’s really talented,” Pharoah said, accord-ing to TV Guide. “She’s amazing. She needs to be on ‘SNL.’ I said it. And I believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year.”
Considering how “SNL” has slipped over the past few de-
cades, one would imagine the producers would be scrambling 
for fresh talent. While women have had an expanded role on 
the show — Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Molly Shannon, Maya Ru-dolph, Kristen Wiig and countless others — it’s still lacking a presence of women of color. Thompson is accomplishing noth-ing by placing the blame on a lack of talent.
It’s not as if the producers — overwhelmingly white and 
male — have any personal incentive to hire black women. It’s 
up to actors like Thompson and Pharoah, as well as other wom-
en, to advocate for more diversity on the show — not blame the problem on a lack of talent.

of a Snapchat?Yoho’s comments evidence of incompetence
The dysfunction that plagues the political system in 
the United States is currently on full display. The federal government has been shut down for about 
two weeks with no apparent resolution in sight.
Worse still, the country is perilously close to reaching 
its debt ceiling, the amount of debt the federal govern-ment is permitted by law to accumulate.
Failing to raise the debt ceiling, which the govern-
ment will reach on Thursday, could prevent the U.S. from paying interest on its debt. If the U.S. failed to meet its ﬁ  nancial obligations on time, the result would be a default that could damage the country’s reputation with 
its creditors and potentially set off a panic in the ﬁ  nancial 
sector. Economists and ﬁ  nancial experts across the spec-trum agree that a debt default by the United States could likely bring about a global economic crisis. A report from 
the Department of the Treasury stated that private-sector 
economic analysts widely agree that reaching the debt ceiling would “lead to events of the magnitude of late 2008 or worse.”
None of these dire predictions seem to matter to our 
own Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), who has been content to ignore the analysis of ﬁ  nancial experts in forming his own baseless assertions. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Yoho said he believes the United States 
defaulting by reaching the debt ceiling would “bring sta-
bility to world markets.”
Yoho’s misguided opinions about the potential effects 
of reaching the debt ceiling have been widely criticized, even by his fellow House Republicans.  Rep. Reid Ribble 
(R-Wis.) described Yoho’s predictions on a debt default 
as “crazy talk.”
As if Yoho’s ignorant comments on the debt ceiling 
were not preposterous enough, he has also attacked the 
hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have 
been furloughed as a result of the government shutdown he helped engineer.On Oct. 5, the House voted to 
approve back pay for these fed-eral workers, which ensures they 
will not be ﬁ  nancially punished 
for the failure of Congress to agree on a plan to fund the gov-ernment.
Although Yoho voted in fa-
vor of the bill, he now claims he 
opposes providing compensation to the federal employ-ees put out of work as a result of the shutdown. Dur-ing a phone conversation with a constituent, Yoho said 
of government employees, “If they’re not working, they 
shouldn’t get paid.”
These federal employees, furloughed from their jobs 
through no fault of their own, wait anxiously for the gov-
ernment shutdown to be resolved so they can return to 
work. In addition, thousands of other federal workers whose jobs are deemed “essential,” including the Capitol Police and employees of the Department of Homeland Security, must work without pay until the shutdown 
ends.
Meanwhile, Yoho continues to collect his congressio-
nal salary, paid in full by the federal government.  
Yoho’s destructive and misinformed comments are 
just the latest evidence he is completely unﬁ  t for elected 
ofﬁ  ce. In the November 2014 congressional elections, Gainesville voters will have the chance to remove Yoho and replace him with someone who competently repre-sents their views and interests.
Any citizen of Gainesville who supports a strong and 
healthy economy and wants political leaders who can deal effectively with the challenges our country faces should take full advantage of that opportunity and vote 
Yoho out of ofﬁ  ce.

Keep trauma center at ORMC open
Some may already know my story, but 
I was one of the ﬁ  rst patients to be treated 
at Ocala Regional Medical Center’s trauma 
center when it opened. I had a splenic ar-
tery aneurysm and died twice before the excellent doctors at Ocala revived me and saved my life. Back in June I wrote about 
my story for the Saint Peters Blog, plead-
ing to keep Ocala’s trauma center open. Another publication’s article by Capt. Gail Lazenby of The Villages Public Safety De-
partment about the 1st District Court of 
Appeals’ decision putting Ocala in danger of closing made me feel the need to write again.       
My experience and my life are testa-
ments to the lifesaving care the trauma center in Ocala provides our community.  There is no doubt in my mind that if the Ocala trauma center did not exist, I would not be here today to tell my story.
There are many others who also owe 
their lives to the amazing care provided by trauma doctors like Dr. Darwin Ang and Dr. Alejandro Garcia at ORMC, who saved my life. So the Department of Health can 
hear these stories and our community’s 
need to keep the trauma center at Ocala Regional, we need to hold a community forum to collectively voice our opinions and to ask Shands to back off its campaign 
to shut down our community’s local ac-
cess to lifesaving trauma care right here in Marion County. Shands should not be able to risk lives in our community just to pad its pockets by monopolizing trauma 
patients.

Letter to the Editor
“If God is so caring and great, why is there suf-
fering in life?”
This thought came to my mind last week af-
ter hearing that the 2-year-old son of a famous NFL running back was tragically killed. I once read that 
unlike other family deaths — for example, a wife 
without her husband is called a widow — there is no word for a parent who loses a child. The pain is too much.
But we don’t need to lose a child to understand 
suffering. Everyone knows that misery and hard-ships, at some level, interrupt our otherwise pleasant lives. In our moments of gloom, an age-old question pops up: We wonder how God, who claims to be both 
powerful and generous, lets innocent people suffer.
This question, more relevant today than ever, has 
long puzzled most religions. Rarely is Islam, my faith 
tradition, part of this discussion, so let me share an insight Islam offers on this mystery of life.
One sentence appears at the start of each chapter 
in the Quran: “In the name of God, Most Merciful and Most Compassionate.”
These words are said to contain the secret of life: 
The divine mercy encompasses and penetrates into “everything in the cosmos, this world and the next,” as the American Muslim theologian Nuh Keller ex-plains.
Islam uniquely emphasizes the concept of “jour-
neying.” Our souls, the essence of our being, are on a timeless journey. Descending to this world, the soul uses a human body as its vehicle for a few decades. After becoming clinically dead, we go onto the next 
life — an eternal one.
Having the big picture always helps. America’s 
best-selling poet Rumi tells us of an ant that is creep-
ing across a mosque carpet and gets pissed off by the obstacle course of “bumps, and strange colours, and patterns.” 
In contrast, the carpet maker, looking from above, 
appreciates how the patterns beautifully come to-gether.
We are like the frustrated 
ant when we forget we dwell on Earth very brieﬂ  y. Only in seeing the larger picture —  
the next few decades being a 
test of how we choose to use the seeds of our individual talents and the next life being the harvest of our struggles 
— can we ﬁ  nd inner peace amid life’s bleakness.
An overwhelming calm comes when you real-
ize that although “the arc of the moral universe is long,” it eventually bends toward justice and that 
our human journeys don’t end in this world. There 
is no need to be impulsively hopeless whenever s**t happens. After all, the universe is in the hands of the all-knowing, with the divine mercy simply asking for our patience.  
But being naive is no option. Sure, we should try to actualize these mental ab-
stractions through a nonjudgmental attitude con-cerning God, but remember, there is no grand escape 
from pain.
Take the poet James Lowell, who was devastated 
when his baby daughter died. Despite recognizing 
the “perfect” logic of eternity, he said, “Not all the preaching since Adam has made Death other than Death.”
As a Muslim, it’s easy to overlook the anguish of 
the Prophet Muhammad — someone who buried 14 of his own children. When his son passed away, he 
held the child in his arms and began to weep.
The prophet’s last words to the lifeless infant are 
deeply edifying: “My little son, I have no ownership 
over you from God . . . Tears ﬂ  ow from the eyes, the heart is plunged in sorrow, but the tongue shall speak only that which does not displease God.”

Madonna is ofﬁ  cially banned from the Alamo 
Drafthouse Cinema.
The theater chain has a strict policy against 
talking and texting during movies, which now apparently applies to areas outside the theaters themselves. 
Rumors surfaced that the star was frantically texting 
during the premiere of “12 Years a Slave” at the New York 
Film Festival, and when someone in the audience asked 
her to stop, Madonna called that person an “enslaver.”
In response, Drafthouse CEO Tim League tweeted that 
she would not be allowed in the company’s theaters until she “apologizes to movie fans.”
The tweet, which was origi-
nally a joke, now seems to have taken a hold and is now enforce-able company policy. 
Should Madonna ever wander 
into one of the seven Drafthouse theaters, she’ll have to take her business elsewhere. 
Such a policy isn’t out of place for the Drafthouse, which 
regularly removes customers from the premises if they are 
using their phones or talking during a movie, which some 
ﬁ  nd controversial.
Forbidding someone from an entire chain of movie the-
aters may be a bit extreme, especially if that person may 
have never been to one of said theaters in the ﬁ  rst place, 
but it’s an extension of the company’s entire attitude to-ward ﬁ  lms and etiquette — babies are only allowed in their theaters on select days.
Warnings are given to customers violating the silence 
policies, but repeat offenders are swiftly and decisively removed. The message is clear: The Drafthouse has made its ideal ﬁ  lm experience and does not care about what you 
have going on outside their walls.
This is harsh, but it makes sense: Why would anyone 
pay to go to a movie and then ignore it? More importantly, 
someone’s lack of interest should not affect other custom-
ers, who also paid to see the movie.
What League did was to — though by accident — take 
this message and apply worldwide. His move empowers 
the honest moviegoer.
In the past, when snarky people placed their conve-
nience over courtesy, the only thing to be done was to complain.
Now, even Madonna is not safe from the righteous fury 
of movie fans, her act of “unbearable rudeness” being 
the ﬁ  nal straw. Of course, Madonna has almost certainly 
moved on with her life by now.
What does it matter to her that she is banned from an 
obscure Texas movie theater chain? She’s still Madonna. This was never about her anyway. League himself reiter-
ated that at its heart, the Madonna ban is still a joke — 
though he loves bringing the “issue to the fore.” 
And, amid the furious backlash from Madonna fans, 
the message in the tweets is still clear: No one, not even 
Madonna, can get away with being rude to moviegoers.

After months of being closed, 
Arbor House reopened its doors 
to pregnant or single women, or women with young children.
The home, which closed due 
to financial struggles, is being re-opened by the St. Francis House, which runs several shelters and transition homes throughout Gainesville.
Kent Vann, the new executive 
director of Arbor House, said under the new management, the home can stay open and contin-
ue serving the community.
“The biggest benefit is we’re 
not losing these beds,” he said, 
referring to the 30 slots Arbor House has for women and chil-dren.
The facility is paid for in part 
by rent, which costs about $300 
per room and no more than 30 
percent of a resident’s income. 
He said the home gets further 
funding through grants, founda-tions and the community.
Vann said previous manage-
ment of Arbor House had strug-gles with funding, but St. Fran-cis House has a bigger umbrella to support it.
“It will be a struggle for us,” 
he said.
Women who live in Arbor 
House can stay for a year while they work with a case manager to improve their lives, Vann said.“They can leave here with 
something they didn’t have be-fore,” Vann said. He said cur-rently they are helping a woman 
earn her GED certificate and 
provided her with a safe place to 
have her baby a few weeks ago.
To become a resident of Ar-
bor House, women must under-
go a screening process, which includes passing a background check and proving they have enough funds to pay rent. He added they must be female, and if they have a male child, he must 
be younger than 9 years old.
“We’re just getting started,” 
said Katelyn Drummet, 22, shel-
ter support staff. “It’s good we’re helping them better themselves for living on their own.” St. Francis reopens Arbor House

A local tattoo shop employ-
ee is shaving her head to help a 
friend in need, and she’s raising money by “selling” all 32 inches of her hair.
Norma Melendez, a recep-
tionist at Bodytech Tattooing and Piercing and UF electrical engineering senior, plans to cut off her brown locks. She’s ask-ing the public to “purchase” her hair for $100 an inch. The 27-year-old will give the proceeds to a friend who was diagnosed 
with acute leukemia in March.
The goal of the project is to 
raise $3,000 to assist with medi-
cal bills.
Melendez’s head will be 
shaved at a public event that will also include a prize draw-ing on Sunday at 6 p.m. at Bodytech, located at 806 W. 
University Ave.
Her friend, who asked to 
remain unnamed, is a fellow 
employee whom Melendez described as fun-loving with a unique sense of humor.
Bodytech co-owner Jen Les-
sard said she was happy to help when Melendez first came to 
her with the idea for the proj-
ect.
Lessard said people can 
purchase drawing tickets in the store or at the event for $5 each or five tickets for $20. In total, more than $700 in prizes and gift certificates is up for grabs in the chance drawing.  
Mother’s Pub and Grill is 
donating prizes for the raffle.
Patrick Schaller, owner of 
Mother’s, said he feels it’s im-portant to contribute to smaller 
causes such as this because 
often, these matters go unno-ticed.
“We basically decided if she 
is going to do it up right, we’re going to do it up right with her and help her raise as much as she could,” he said.
The night will begin with 
Melendez’s hair being braided into several strands and cut. She said the person who the event is supporting will then shave her head. 
Melendez plans to later get 
a small tattoo on her scalp to commemorate the experience. The event will conclude with 
the drawing.
Melendez said she was part-
ly inspired to do this project be-
cause she lost a close friend to cancer earlier this year.
“There’s too much of it 
around that you can’t really do much about, so this is my way to do something,” Melendez 
said. “And I kind of figured 
that hair is only temporary.”
Melendez’s hair will be do-
nated to Locks of Love, a non-profit that creates hairpieces for underprivileged children suf-fering from long-term medical hair loss from any diagnosis.UF student sells hair 
to support friendLOCAL� THE EVENT IS AT 3 P.M. TODAY.

In honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 
UF scheduled a panel titled Know the Limits: Healthy 
Relationships, Safety and Resources to educate stu-dents on healthy relationships.
The event is free and open to the public. It will be 
held in Smathers Library East, Room 1A, at 3 p.m.
Isabel D. Silver, event organizer, said it’s essential 
for partners to “become aware when they’re crossing the line.”
UPD Sgt. Kristy Sasser, one of the event’s panel-
ists, said people have the opportunity to ask anony-mous questions.
According to the Florida Coalition Against Do-
mestic Violence, between 22 and 25 percent of wom-en will be  victims of domestic violence.
“We want to make sure that the community is 
aware of this issue,” Sasser said, “and that people are aware that it is a crime that they don’t have to endure.”
Laura Templeton, a victim advocate for University 
Police, said domestic violence isn’t only physical but 
can be emotional, sexual and verbal.
Sasser said 13 cases of domestic violence, six cases 
of dating violence, one domestic disturbance and two 
dating disturbances have been reported this year.
The event sponsors are UF Smathers Libraries, Uni-
versity Police, the UF Counseling &  Wellness Center and Peaceful Paths Domestic Abuse Network.Panel explains relationship no-no’s� THEY MAY HAVE ALSO USED

A Gainesville woman and 
man were arrested Sunday after 
a purse-snatching incident in a Publix parking lot, and in a con-tinuing investigation, police say 
at least one was also connected to 
fraudulently used credit cards.
According to a GPD arrest re-
port, Stephanie Ann Cleary, 24, and Clifford Bailey Taylor, 28, were booked into the Alachua County Jail on charges of robbery by sudden snatching. Cleary was also charged with fraudulent/ il-
legal use of credit cards.  
Chelsea Megan Snyder was 
just getting out of a car as Janet 
Groesbeck, who was parked in front of Snyder at the Publix lo-cated at 5200 NW 43rd St., walked up to her own vehicle with gro-ceries.
Before Groesbeck began un-
loading her cart, Snyder said, a man ran up to her and grabbed her purse. He ran to a white truck, climbed in and was driven away.An officer followed the truck 
down Northwest 39th Avenue and stopped it at the Boys & Girls 
Club of Alachua County. The offi-
cer found Cleary at the wheel and Taylor in the passenger’s seat.
Another officer identified the 
pair as the same people suspected of taking a wallet from the Target parking lot Sunday afternoon.
They had also 
allegedly used 
stolen credit 
cards around town, GPD spokesman Of-ficer Ben To-bias wrote in an email.
On Friday, 
a GPD officer also identified 
Cleary in three surveillance vid-
eos, where she used a credit card that didn’t belong to her to make small purchases at two conve-nience stores and Family Dollar, according to another arrest re-port.
The investigation is continu-
ing, Tobias said.
As of press time, Cleary and 
Taylor both remained at the jail with bonds set at $12,000 and $10,000, respectively.Purse stealers arrested

Following the Mike Rice player-abuse 
scandal in April that left the Rutgers bas-
ketball program in shambles, Eli Carter de-
cided he needed a new start.
Coach Billy Donovan and the Gators of-
fered him one in Gainesville.
When video leaked of Rice hurling 
basketballs and shoving players during 
the Scarlet Knights’ practices, the bottom dropped out of the program. They were suddenly without their head coach, assis-tant coach and four players — including 
Carter, who decided to transfer.Before he suffered a season-ending bro-
ken right leg on Feb. 16, Carter was Rutgers’ leading scorer with 14.9 points per game. 
When he decided to 
leave following the scan-
dal, he had to choose between Maryland and 
Florida.
When asked what 
was the deciding factor 
in coming to play for the 
Gators, Carter replied, 
“Just coach Donovan really.”
Assistant Rashon Burno also had a role 
in landing the 6-foot-2 junior guard, as both 
he and Carter attended Jersey City (N.J.) St. Anthony’s High. 
Burno reached out to the fellow alum-
nus in April. The transfer was made ofﬁ  cial May 10.
Donovan said the most impressive thing 
about Carter is his ability to move on from a tough situation and maintain optimism 
about the future.
“The thing I admired most is he only had 
positive things to say about Rutgers, and 
he only had positive things to say about 
coach Rice,” Donovan said. “But I think he 
looked at it as a difﬁ  cult situation that was unfortunate (and) that he appreciated his ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

In the span of three plays, D.J. 
Humphries single-handedly end-
ed Florida’s chance at a comeback against LSU.
Trailing 17-6 late in the fourth 
quarter, the Gators had a third and 10 at the Tigers 20-yard line when Humphries jumped the snap count and was ﬂ  agged for a 5-yard false-start penalty.
Seconds later, LSU defensive end 
Jordan Allen blew past Humphries untouched and put a hit on quar-terback Tyler Murphy, who eluded 
Allen but was sacked by Jalen Mills. 
All Humphries could do was stick his arm out.
Pushed back to the LSU 37-
yard line, Murphy had one last chance to manage a comeback, but Humphries failed him again. Kend-ell Beckwith shook Humphries and sacked Murphy, forcing a fumble 
and giving the Tigers possession.
After the game, Humphries 
apologized to his teammates.
“I just told the boys they depend 
on me too much in a critical time for 
me give up or allow something like that to happen,” the sophomore said.
But Humphries was not the only 
cog on the offensive line to struggle against No. 6 LSU’s (6-1, 3-1 South-eastern Conference) defensive front.
In a reversal of the Gators’ 14-6 
victory against the Tigers in 2012, No. 22 Florida (4-2, 3-1 SEC) strug-gled to protect Murphy in the pass game or create holes for the Gators’ 
running backs.
“We weren’t physical enough 
up front,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “It was kind of 
the same scenario, our same situa-tion last year, but reversed in that they had an intent to do what we did last year. And I think they won that battle.”
Murphy was sacked four times 
on Saturday for a loss of 40 yards. The Tigers ofﬁ  cially hurried him on four plays, but the redshirt junior rarely had time to target receivers

Bourbon Street is the Mecca of

The Sugar

With the

Florida leapfrogged Georgia, 
which lost to Alabama in Atlanta. 
There will be no Atlanta or New 
Orleans if No. 22 Florida can’t take care of business Saturday in Colum-
bia, Mo. 
No, that’s not a typo. No. 14 Mis-
souri can now make or break Flori-
da’s season.
As if playing against a team in 
Big 12 Country isn’t ironic enough, Missouri is referred to as the “Show-Me” state. 
After a woeful performance 
against No. 6 LSU, Florida has to prove it can win with a depleted offensive line, defensive line, back-ﬁ  eld and a quarterback who hasn’t 
beaten a team with a winning con-
ference record.
This certainly is not the year Mus-
champ and the rest of the Gators ex-pected after going 11-2 last season.
Death by a thousand season-end-
ing injuries is a slow, painful decline that leaves a team gasping for air. A lack of depth spells trouble in a con-
ference that regularly sends players 
to the NFL.

berger said he treated the win as a Gators will

The injury bug continues to 
wreak havoc on the Gators.
Redshirt junior center Damontre 
Harris (hamstring) and sophomore 
guard Michael Frazier II (virus) will miss practice for an indefinite amount of time, coach Billy Dono-
van said Tuesday. 
“I don’t know when Frazier actu-
ally got sick,” Donovan said. “Da-
montre has been dealing with some hamstring issues a little bit. Even go-ing back to conditioning and stuff, he’s kind of worked through it. But 
I think the trainer wanted to pull 
him out just because he didn’t want to set him back too long. He didn’t practice [Monday].”
Donovan said Frazier had blood 
work done and the hope is more would be known by today.
Harris has had several setbacks 
since transferring from South Caro-
lina. He sat out 2012-13 because of 
NCAA transfer rules but also suf-fered a torn labrum and battled a sprained ankle and strep throat throughout the course of the season.
Frazier and Harris’ absences hurt 
the Gators’ practice depth. UF is al-ready missing forward Will Yeguete (knee) and Rutgers transfer guard 
Eli Carter (leg). Donovan expects 
Yeguete to return to practice in  a few weeks but in a limited capacity. 
“I would say Will is further along 
right now,” Donovan said. “Eli is doing some stuff, non-contact. Any-thing we’re doing without contact, he’s tried to participate in. But he’s still up in the air where he’s at and how much longer it’s going to take him to get back.
“With Eli and Will being out, 
we’re basically down to seven guys. There’s been little rest. There’s not been a lot of depth.”
To add to the Gators’ injury woes, 
the younger Billy Donovan — a red-shirt junior transfer out of Division III Catholic University — is practic-ing with a torn labrum in his right shoulder that he suffered sometime in August or September. The elder Donovan said his son would try to avoid surgery and play through it.
“He’s wearing a protective shoul-
der brace so it doesn’t get popped out,” the Florida coach said. “He’s still able to play, but I know he’s in some pain there.”
During practice, Donovan has 
seen his team regress defensively. Fatigue from more time on the court due to a lack of healthy players could 
be a reason why. 
“If there was one disappoint-
ing factor — it’s hard for me to say 
just because we don’t have all of our pieces there — but we are drastically worse defensively than we were a year ago,” Donovan said. 
“Just us keeping field-goal per-
centage defense ... where our num-
bers are at in relationship to where 
they were last year and some of the things we are charting, is way, way off right now.”Injuries hampering UFdownfield. He had only four passes lon-
ger than 10 yards. His 36-yard pooch punt traveled farther than any completed pass.
“[LSU] did a good job getting in the 
backfield and getting pressure,” Murphy 
said. “Any time a team does that, your 
timing will be off.”
After the game, right guard Jon Hala-
pio attributed the issues on the line to mis-communication, but left guard Max Garcia said Tuesday that it came down to a much simpler problem.
“We need to do a better job of going out 
with a nasty attitude,” he said.
Florida might have survived its trip to 
Death Valley if its running game had burst through holes, but the offensive line failed to open many.
The Tigers limited the Gators to 111 
rushing yards — Florida’s worst output of the season.
Starting running back Matt Jones had a 
decent start, rushing for 17 yards on four 
carries, but he left the game in the first 
quarter with an injury that was later re-vealed to be a season-ending torn menis-cus.
Redshirt junior Mack Brown and fresh-
man Kelvin Taylor received most of the carries for the rest of the game with mixed results. Brown grinded out 3.7 yards per carry on 15 attempts. Taylor, flashing the speed the made him one of the top-ranked 2013 halfback recruits, notched 52 yards on 10 carries.
“I felt like little K-man did his thing,” 
Humphries said. “He took advantage of 
his opportunities.”
But Taylor’s solid performance could not win the game for Florida. He needed 
his linemen to protect better and make the passing game threatening so the Gators’ 
offense would not appear one dimension-
al. Instead, the line failed, and Humphries spent the postgame apologizing.
If the players on the offensive line have 
anything to say about it, they will not have to say  ‘sorry’ again
“We want to put the team on our backs 
now,” Garcia said. “We feel like we’re be-ing called out by the media and by all these 
people, but we’re calling ourselves out as 
an offensive-line unit.”WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Tyler Murphy throws a pass during Florida’s 17-6 loss to LSU on Saturday at Tiger Stadium in Baton 
Rouge, La. The Gators will be tested on Saturday when No. 22 Florida travels to face No. 14 Missouri.
Gators need statement win
chance to remind Florida who 
LSU is — a physical team that dominates the trenches. Florida 
has that opportunity come Satur-
day. 
Missouri shocked Georgia in 
enemy territory to improve to 6-0 
and move a game up on UGA, 
Florida and South Carolina. A loss against the Tigers would leave the Gators trailing by two games with matchups against the 
No. 15 Bulldogs and the No. 11 
Gamecocks still looming on the schedule. 
Missouri, with its starting 
quarterback James Franklin out 
for 3-5 weeks, has South Carolina 
and seventh-ranked Texas A&M at home. The schedule gods smiled on Missouri, which went 
2-6 in its first season in the SEC 
last year.
It isn’t as easy for the Gators. 
That’s why Saturday matters. 
The message following the 
loss in Baton Rouge, La., was that the season’s goals remained in-tact. Everybody assumes the SEC 
East goes through Georgia. At 
this moment, for a down Florida team, the division goes through the “Show-Me” state.
Thinking back to New Year’s 
2012, I remember peeing in a uri-nal when the clock struck 12. 
I remember the late-night 
Krystal burger. I remember the 
beads, beer and Po-boys. 
I remember the excitement in 
the streets from Florida fans be-
cause their team was in its first BCS bowl since 2010 and first 
without Tim Tebow and Urban 
Meyer. 
The Gators had a flawed team 
in 2012 with a ridiculously good 
defense and an offense that did 
just enough. 
A year later, the defense isn’t 
as automatic and the offense isn’t as productive. ‘Just enough’ 
won’t cut it this season.

thinks perhaps this Saturday 
might be the kick in the pants

time and just kind of tried to move

Donovan said he has not asked 
about any specifics involving Cart-er and Rice. 
Carter also does not speak with 
his new teammates about the situ-
ation.
“Honestly, I’m really not fo-
cused on that,” Carter said. “I’m 
just trying to focus on this season coming up.”
Despite transferring amid a 
media frenzy while continuing to rehab a broken leg that has kept him out of practice this preseason, 
Carter said the transition has not 
been as difficult as it seems.
“It’s been actually kind of easy 
for me because of the staff and my 
teammates,” he said. “They made 
it easy for me. They keep my spir-its high. They keep me motivated. The guys that I’m working with in rehab ... they’re great.”
Carter said he does not have a 
timetable for his return to the court, but he added that working one-on-
one with coaches and trainers on 
non-contact drills like shooting has helped him progress daily.
Still, Donovan said he couldn’t 
help but feel for the 22-year-old 
out of Paterson, N.J. 
“When you’re a transfer and 
you’re coming in and you’re try-
ing to prove yourself and you can 
never do that because you’re never 
healthy to play, that’s really a hard thing for him to go through,” Don-ovan said. 
“Even in the stuff he has been 
able to do, he’s been kind of hob-bled. Usually, I think one of things that kind of always generates a bond inside your team is when 
guys respect each other for their 
talent level (and) how hard they compete and play. And he’s never been able to do that.”CARteR , from page 1316, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2013
� WILLIAMS IS A FRESHMAN.
GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
Expectations for incoming fresh-
man Ronni Williams could not be 
higher. 
Williams, who was the top-
ranked recruit from the state of 
Florida in the Class of 2013 accord-
ing to ESPN, is the Gators’ ﬁ  rst signee to be named a McDonald’s All-American. 
She is also the highest-rated re-
cruit signed in program history. 
A lot of hype surrounds Wil-liams. According to her coach and 
teammates, it is merited. 
“She has been fantastic,” coach 
Amanda Butler said. “As a fresh-
man, she’s already established her-self as a very important person on this team.”
Entering her ﬁ  rst offseason at 
UF, Williams was poised to make a signiﬁ  cant impact because of 
Florida’s limited roster of only 10 
players. 
But with Viktorija Dimaite out 
for the season after suffering an ACL injury, Williams will be given even more responsibility. She will split time at center with sophomore Christin Mercer. 
“I expect it to go very well,” Wil-
liams said. “It’s nothing new.”
Added Mer-
cer: “Ronni, I 
would say, is going to make a huge impact because she is a great attacker 
like I am.”
Williams ﬁ  ts 
the offensive 
scheme Butler is employing this 
season. With an added emphasis on speed and the transition game, Williams ﬁ  ts in well. “What I’ve seen so far is that 
we’ve been very consistent,” Wil-liams said. “We’re hard workers. I don’t think anybody works as hard as we do. We get after it and we get at it and we get it done.”
Listed as a forward, Williams is 
versatile enough to excel at any po-sition on the ﬂ  oor. 
In high school, she recorded 
25 rebounds in a single game dur-ing her sophomore year, scored 45 points in another game during her junior year and tallied 93 blocks during her senior season. 
When asked what aspect of the 
game is her biggest strength, Wil-liams responded: “I like to drive a 
lot. I attack the basket.”
What impresses Butler the most 
is the way Williams adjusts to the 
game and accepts criticism. 
“The thing that’s been so amaz-
ing about Ronni is not the level of talent and the high level at which she’s already able to play,” Butler said. 
“She’s so eager, so coachable, 
and just so easily makes adjust-ments whether it be in practice or off the court. I’ve been really proud of the spirit and energy of a player who is that talented and highly touted.”

Lauren Silver is proving to be a catalyst 
when it comes to scoring goals.
The outside back topped her previous 
highest season total in assists after her 
cross from the near ﬂ  ank helped freshman 
forward Savannah Jordan score against 
Mississippi State on Friday. 
Silver has ﬁ  ve assists this season, with 
two of them setting up Jordan.
“Savannah and I kind of developed a 
pattern the entire season thus far,” Silver said. “Whenever I get the ball, I’m usually looking for her. When we got the ball, I kept wanting it to be switched to my side 
because I kept looking for Savannah. I knew that if we could give the ball to her, 
somehow we could get the result that we needed.”
The junior has had three years to de-
velop her skills as an outside back and get comfortable in offensive situations.
In 2012, Silver notched only three assists 
as coach Becky Burleigh placed greater em-phasis on midﬁ  elders making plays rather than outside backs producing assists.
The Gators scored 54 goals last season, 
but only one came from an outside back — a game-winning score from Taylor Travis against UCF in the NCAA Tournament. Of the 49 assists recorded in 2012, only 10 came from outside backs. 
With Florida relying heavily on using 
the width of the ﬁ  eld this year, the out-side backs have produced more offensive plays.
Of the 30 goals Florida has scored this 
season, outside backs have made assists on half of them.
“When I can talk to [teammates] and 
develop a relationship with those people on and off the ﬁ  eld, it makes it a lot easier to get my job done, as well as help them with theirs,” Silver said.
Those connections will be critical for 
the Gators this weekend. Florida faces the top two teams in the Southeastern Confer-ence: LSU and Kentucky.
The Wildcats come to Gainesville on 
Friday with a 5-1 record in the conference. The Tigers, who are 5-0-1 in the SEC, lead 
the league entering the weekend. 
Burleigh said she would like to see her 
outside backs continue to be involved at 
both ends of the ﬁ  eld.
“Our outside backs are actually get-
ting production this year,” Burleigh said. “That’s a credit to all of them for the work that they’ve put in both during practice and outside of practice.” Florida to rely on strong defense against tough SEC foesWilliams
