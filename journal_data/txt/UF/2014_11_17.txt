Saturday was the ﬁ  nal blow.
Following Florida’s 23-20 overtime loss to 
South Carolina, it marked the end for Will Muschamp. 
The fourth-year head coach will stepped 
down from his position following the con-clusion of the regular season, the school an-nounced Sunday.
“Upon evaluation of our football pro-
gram, we are not where the program needs to be and should be. I’ve always said that our goal at the University of Florida is to com-pete for championships on a regular basis,” UF athletics director Jeremy Foley said in a 
release. “Coach Muschamp was dedicated to 
developing young men both on and off the ﬁ  eld.”
For too many reasons, it hasn’t worked 
out for Muschamp at Florida. 
A tenure teetering on the precipice this 
season thanks to the ability to claw two wins in a row has now been pushed over the edge.
In the end, as the Gamecocks carried their 
quarterback off the ﬁ  eld on their shoulders, the Gators hung their heads in sorrow — an-other gutting home loss delivered in a unique fashion serving as the last straw.
Muschamp’s tenure is over in large part 
because of a failure to evaluate and develop offensive talent on the ﬁ  eld, but there were other issues as well. 
There were too many losses to Georgia, 
LSU and South Carolina (three each) with a likely third coming against Florida State in two weeks. 
Muschamp’s Gators were 27-20 overall 
and 17-15 in SEC games, and 11 of those con-ference wins came against Tennessee, Van-derbilt and Kentucky.
Sometimes, the wins were even more in-
explicable than the losses. 
There was the punt block needed to de-
feat Louisiana at home in 2012, a season in which Florida was a USC victory over Notre Dame from a national championship game. 
There were ﬁ  ve in Muschamp’s career 
that came when UF threw for fewer than 100 yards, unthinkable for an offense that didn’t run the triple-option primarily. One of those wins came against Georgia on Nov. 1, a vic-tory that few people, if any, saw coming.
There wasn’t a bowl game last season fol-
lowing a 4-8 record that ofﬁ  cially put Mus-champ on the coaching hot seat. 
With a loss to Georgia Southern to boot — 
a salt in the wound as the season died down — the words “ﬁ  rst time since 1979 (0-10-1 season)” were written too many times.
His team lost to Vanderbilt on homecom-
ing in 2013 — a cardinal sin. He was 18-8 at home and never able to “defend the swamp” 
as other coaches had, even when he used 
that as a rallying cry in the week leading up to the South Carolina loss.

Undergraduate business stu-
dents are eager to settle into their 
new home in Heavener Hall after the building’s opening ceremony Friday afternoon.
The $35-million, 57,000-square-
foot building is located on the cor-ner of West University Avenue and Southwest 13th Street and will hold the Warrington College of Business Administration’s undergraduate programs and activities.
Finance junior Cassidy Haack 
said she’s excited the hall is open af-ter watching it come together over the last two years.
“The features are a dream come 
true,” Haack, 20, said. “It’s our little nerdy business school thing. It feels like a business major’s home.”
Heavener Hall boasts nine 
classrooms, 16 study rooms and 29 advising ofﬁ  ces. The college’s un-dergraduate program serves about 5,000 students and more than 30 or-ganizations.
Horace Tucker, associate direc-
tor of the School of Business in the Warrington College of Business Administration, said it’s a great re-source, and the undergraduate stu-dents deserve a home base like the accounting and graduate students.
“It brings the resources into one 
single space,” Tucker said. “They deserve the best.”
Featured spaces include a pro-
fessional developmental center, international programs suite, mul-tipurpose area and small cafe. Stu-dents can also visit the Discovery Cube, which has a ﬁ  ve-minute self-assessment test room where students receive help deﬁ  ning their career paths.
“It will impact the lives of gen-
erations of UF students and further enhance our position as one of the nation’s elite business schools,” said John Kraft, dean of the Warrington 
School of Business Administration.
Kraft said the single, dynamic 
space will provide great network-

With her hands clenched 
tightly together, Dawn Hunt 
watched her son fight in what 
would be his last match as an 
amateur mixed martial arts fighter Friday night.
Dawn’s son, Lorenzo Hunt, 
was one of 18 fighters who participated in Major League Fighting’s “Friday Night Fights” at Level Nightclub, 238 W. University Ave. The event 
included nine fights, two of 
which were title fights.
About 280 people huddled 
around the metal-wired octa-
gon cage at about 9:30 p.m. to 
watch the matches.
Friday’s first fighter was 
Ricky Jantzen, who is from Ohio but trains in Gainesville. 
His pitch-black beard matched his hoodie, which bounced 
with him as he tottered back 
and forth before the brawl.
Jantzen wrestled with his 
opponent for three rounds 
before he was unanimously deemed victor — the first win 
of his amateur career.
“The hardest part was not 
knowing anything about the 
other guy,” he said. “Stamina 
is easy because I’m a cardio 
guy.”
Major League Fighting 
founder Hunter Winter paid the nightclub $7,000 to host 
the Friday night event. Win-
ter started his organization in 2012, two years after fighting locally, and the group hosts 
fighting events statewide.
“I definitely took a loss to-
night,” he said, referring to 
how many people attended the event.
Despite the event’s low turnout, Winter said he was happy with the crowd’s enthu-
siasm. He plans to host more 
local fights but said the next one wouldn’t be until Spring semester.
“When you have two bas-
ketball games going on the same night, it’s tough,” he said.
About two hours into the 
night, a determined 32-year-old Lorenzo walked slowly toward the ring after an an-nouncer echoed his name. Eminem’s “’Till I Collapse” 
blasted from the speakers and 
boomed off the walls, over-powering the cheers from Hunt’s fans, family and sup-
porters.
Dawn, 49, stood behind the 
railing and videotaped her son 
as his coach prepped him be-fore Lorenzo climbed up the 
stairs and into the cage.“Let’s go, Lorenzo!” Dawn 
shouted just before the fight began.
She and her family drove 
from St. Augustine, Florida, 
to see Lorenzo fight. She said this was his last match before 
he would fight professionally.
“He’s a humble guy,” she 
said. “Humble is good because 
you don’t know everything, 
and there’s always something 
to learn.”
In the ring, Lorenzo’s op-
ponent, Garrick James, was on top of him most of the fight, 
pounding at his head and 
midsection.
By the third round, Lorenzo 
was exhausted and couldn’t 
shake James off.
“Come on, Lorenzo! Come 
on, boy!” yelled Justin Dee, 
who promotes Lorenzo’s fights to raise money for mul-
tiple sclerosis.
But as the bell rang at the 
end of the third round, Dawn 
and Dee knew Lorenzo was 
done.
Dee, who lost his voice by 
the end of the fight, said it was 
tough watching Lorenzo lose because of all the work he and 
Lorenzo’s team put into pro-
moting him.
Dee said he raised $400 
from donations and selling T-shirts throughout the night, all of which will go to the Mul-tiple Sclerosis Foundation.
“We’ve been working 
months for this,” Dee said. “He doesn’t have to win for something good to happen.”
The loss gave Hunt a 6-2 
record in amateur fighting, which won’t affect him turn-ing pro, Dawn said.
“He might’ve been knocked 
down, but he wasn’t knocked out,” she said. “He’ll be back.”

There will be one less car on locals’ 
daily commutes this week.  
The One Less Car week is a collab-
orative initiative between UF’s Office 
of Sustainability and UF Parking and 
Transportation Services, where stu-
dents, faculty and staff are encouraged to use sustainable transportation.
“Every Gator can make a differ-
ence while helping us move closer to our campus-wide goal of carbon neu-trality by 2025,” Allison Vitt, outreach and communications coordinator for the Office of Sustainability, said in an 
email.
Alternatives to single-occupancy 
vehicles include Regional Transit Sys-
tem buses, bicycles, skateboards and carpool options through the transporta-tion and parking services website, such as Zimride and Zipcar, said Matthew Williams, director of UF’s Office of Sus-tainability and Energy Integration.
“We’re asking people to sign up and 
make a commitment this week, and then, at some point during that week, choose one of their alternatives,” Wil-liams said.
Williams said Gainesville has what 
is recognized as the best public trans-portation system in the state of Florida.
“Gainesville is really lucky as far as 
a small college town within north cen-tral Florida to have as many different sustainable transportation alternatives as we do,” Williams said.
UF’s Office of Sustainability and 
Energy Integration office is working 
to connect people who are uncertain 
about modes of sustainable transporta-tion and help them come up with solu-tions that work for them.
“We’re helping people make the 
choice and have a positive experience doing it,” Williams said.UF on board

“The journey for each and ev-
ery undergraduate business stu-
dent now begins at Heavener 
Hall,” Kraft said. “This magnificent building will provide the tools and amenities and confidence for stu-dents to succeed and develop their dreams.”
Heavener Hall was named in 
honor of James “Bill” Heavener, a 1970 UF business administration alumnus and the building’s lead benefactor. Heavener has already contributed to a few buildings on campus.
“I’m blown away by all this,” 
Heavener said. “It’s just been a 
great journey for me.”Jasmin Tahirovic, a combined fi-
nance and master’s of international business junior, said he’s looking 
forward to the collaborative study spaces and watching the freshmen delve into involvement — a key out-of-the-classroom component to success in the college.
“Since we heard, we’ve been 
excited,” Tahirovic, 21, said. “It’s a 
huge advantage. I’ll be there five 
days a week.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2014

A Gainesville man was arrest-
ed early Friday after Gainesville 
Police said he beat up his girl-
friend and threatened to slit her 
throat in her sleep.  
Matthew John Schaller, 30, 
got into an argument with his 
girlfriend — whom he has two 
children with — around 3 a.m. at their home, located at 4455 SW 34th St. During the fight, the woman told police that Schaller 
hit her on the side of her head.
The woman then went up-
stairs to get away from Schaller, 
but he followed and yelled at her. 
He then chased the woman back downstairs and started to punch her on the arms and legs, accord-
ing to the police report.
Schaller then grabbed the 
woman from behind, wrapped 
his arm around her neck and 
choked her, causing her to briefly pass out and fall to the ground. She told police she hit her head during the fall.
The woman said Schaller then 
grabbed a knife and told her he was going to cut her throat in her sleep.
While holding the knife, the 
woman said Schaller forced her to write a note giving him per-mission to leave the home with their children. She said Schaller also held a Taser in her face and threatened to hurt her with it.
The fight with Schaller left 
the woman with red and bruised knees and knuckles, a swollen hand and scratches on her right arm, according to the report
Schaller was arrested on 
charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, battery and domestic battery by stran-gulation. He is being held on a 
$25,000 bond.

A 62-year-old man was ar-
rested early Sunday morning after police said he woke up his 
girlfriend in her sleep and began attacking her.Shortly before 5 a.m., Theodore 
Roosevelt Wilson approached the woman as she was sleeping in their home, 3020 SW Archer Road. He began arguing with her 
and dragged her out of bed.
Once out of bed, Wilson 
pushed her to the floor. The 
woman said Wilson then grabbed a glass lamp from a nearby night 
stand and smashed her over the 
head with it, shattering the lamp and cutting the woman’s ear and shoulder, the report said.
The woman said Wilson then 
started punching her on the head and body. He then placed his hands around her neck and be-gan to strangle her.The woman said she was in 
fear for her life, so she fled the apartment and called for help.
When the woman returned 
home, GPD arrived and said she had a bruise on her chest and a swollen face. She then told police 
Wilson regularly smokes crack 
cocaine and proceeded to show them his crack pipe stash.
Wilson was arrested on charg-
es of aggravated battery, domes-

Twenty-three people were either ar-
rested or ejected at the UF vs. University 
of South Carolina football game Saturday 
afternoon — a steep decline from the 64 people either arrested or ejected at the 
homecoming game against the University 
of Missouri on Oct. 18.
Of the 21 who were ejected from the 
game, five were UF students. Seven ejec-
tions were made for possession of alcohol, seven ejections were for non-students us-ing Gator 1 Cards, five ejections were for intoxication and two were for disorderly 
conduct, according to a University Police 
press release.
One of the two individuals arrested was 
a UF student. One arrest was for trespass-
ing after warning, and the other was for 
possession of marijuana.
The number of arrests and ejections 
made at Saturday’s game was the fewest recorded all season — just two shy of the 25 people who were either arrested or ejected at the terminated home opener against the 
University of Idaho on Aug. 30.
The last time the Gators played the 
Gamecocks at home on Oct. 20, 2012, there 
was a total of 106 ejections and 12 arrests. Of the 106 people who were ejected, 35 
were UF students. Three of the 12 arrests 
made that day were also UF students.Sharp decline since last game: only 23 ejected, arrested

For the fourth year in a row, 
a UF dance team took first place 
at India Festival in Tampa.
Twelve UF students from 
Gator Garba competed against 
the University of South Florida 
in the 27th annual festival.
At the competition, the 
dancers put a modern spin on a traditional colorful folk dance from Gujarat, a state in the western part of India.
Dance captain Anjali Desai, 
20, said the team usually prac-
tices three times a week for few 
hours, but during the competi-tion, practices were every day.
“Our girls were really dedi-
cated, and they performed very well,” the UF sociology junior said.
The four-minute and 15-
second dance landed the team 
a trophy and $500. Desai said 
the money will go toward cos-tumes. This year’s cost $140 per dancer.
Desai said the festival pro-
vides an opportunity for the dance group to experience In-dian culture.
“It’s really interesting be-
cause there’s always different performances, and we get to see different cultural aspects of 
India,” she said.
Jemma Patel, who is also 
dance captain on the team, said 
the next dance competition will be in Orlando on Satur-day. Patel, 21, choreographed the dance with Desai and other teammates. They used a clas-sical Garba song and made a 
mix to add a modern touch.
Patel said dance is a way 
for her to connect to her Indian 
culture. She has practiced Gar-ba since she was young.
Claudia Anez, a 20-year-old 
member, said she was anxious before the competition. De-spite nervousness, the UF bi-
ology junior said her favorite 
part of the festival was danc-ing with her teammates and the culture.
“We get to experience all of 
the different Indian food,” she said. “Also the different dress-es they wear.”
Anez said other UF Indian 
dance teams such as GatorRass Dance Team and Gator Bhan-gra  also competed, but they were in different categories.
More people should join 
dance teams, regardless of cul-tural affiliation, she said.

a chance, you get to see how

For college students, the solution to 
the freshman 15 could be as simple as a 
daily message.
A study conducted by researchers 
from colleges around the U.S., including 
UF, discovered that message alerts may 
help students adopt healthier lifestyles.  
The study, partially funded by a grant 
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, recruited students to participate in the 15-month-long Young Adults Eating and Active for Health research initiative.
More than 1,600 young adults, includ-
ing UF students, contributed to the study.
All participants were required to be col-
lege students between the ages of 18 and 24. The participants were divided into two groups of about 800. Both groups watched video and PowerPoint lessons on healthy habits.
Over the following months of the 
study, one group got email alerts while 
the other group did not.
The message alerts included informa-tion about the benefits of eating certain 
vegetables like tomatoes or what their portion sizes should be, according to an IFAS news release. The researchers found the students who received the message alerts ate more fruits and vegetables and 
were more physically active than the stu-
dents who did not receive the alerts.
Kendra Kattelmann, the lead research-
er for the study and a nutrition professor at South Dakota State University, said the researchers had to address other issues college students face, along with motivat-ing the students to eat healthier.
Kattelmann said the researchers were 
more concerned about giving the students strategies to adopt healthier lifestyles in order to prevent weight gain, rather than being concerned about the students los-ing weight during the study.

In the six months since Grace 
Marketplace opened its doors, Jon 
DeCarmine has been sprinting.
A host of issues, including insuf-
ficient funding and amassing com-
munity support, have burdened 
DeCarmine, the operations director 
of the Alachua County Coalition for 
the Homeless and Hungry. Each 
month he faces a $15,000 deficit.
But on Sunday, he slowed down 
for an afternoon to host Grace’s open 
house, a celebration featuring mu-
sic, tree planting and awards meant to garner support for the struggling shelter.
“We haven’t had a chance to step 
back and show the work that we’ve done,” DeCarmine said. “This is the first day that we’ve stopped and looked back.”
The open house kicked off Sun-
day morning with the presentation of a community service award to Hazel Williams, better known as Sis-ter Hazel. Nearly 200 people packed into Grace’s small, white chapel to join in the celebration for Williams’ Citizen of Grace recognition.
“While I’m speaking, open up 
jobs for whoever is here needs one, give peace to whoever is here that is depressed, give joy to somebody who never feels joy,” she said while leading the room in prayer. “And give grace and glory to the Grace Marketplace.”
After the ceremony, the crowd 
spilled into the lawn between the old Gainesville Correctional Institu-tion buildings, which have become home to Grace’s facilities. Live bands played throughout the afternoon, two food trucks — Off the Griddle and Bubba Luigi’s Road Trip — parked on the basketball court, serv-ing quick meals, and guests added chalk drawings to two strips of brown paper that serve as the inspi-
ration for a future Grace mural.
The event was a collaboration 
with Friends of Grace Marketplace, 
an organization of volunteers aim-ing to support the shelter.
The organization’s co-coordina-
tor, Randi Cameon, said the group has been working for about two months to plan the event and elimi-nate preconceived notions about the homeless community and the shel-ter’s efforts.
“Nobody knows how incredibly 
much they are already doing, how incredibly successful it is,” Cameon said. “They call it a one-stop em-powerment center.”  
UF President Bernie Machen 
now serves on the shelter’s over-sight committee and attended the open house. His wife, Chris, said she hopes the event gave visitors a new perspective of the shelter.
“People don’t want to come 
here,” she said, adding that the open house may have made more com-munity members aware of Grace’s financial struggles, including reno-
vations of two roofs that could cost 
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
“I think this can work, but it’s a 
community deal,” she said. “It’s just got to work. It’s too late to turn back now.”
David Hickey and his 20-year-
old daughter Celine, a Santa Fe Col-lege natural resource conservation student, said the pair was visiting the shelter for the first time Sunday. They said they were impressed with 
the new facility and its attempt at 
not only harboring and feeding the homeless but also helping them get out of homelessness.
“I would like to see a place that 
would have the counseling — which I understand this is guaranteeing — so that people can have some solu-tion,” David Hickey said.
“It’s more than just charity. It’s 
solution,” Celine Hickey said.
The Hickeys joined a growing 
crowd at the food trucks mid-after-noon, just as a Grace resident, a 41-year-old man who goes by Lil’ Nik-kie was getting his meal.  
The 125 residents who attended 
breakfast that morning received a 
lunch ticket they could redeem at ei-
ther of the trucks. A pay-it-forward container at the Friends of Grace Marketplace booth collected $5 from visitors to pay for each ticket.
When Lil’ Nikkie lost his ticket, 
Cameon gave him $5 to redeem his meal. He came over to her, his face beaming, with a fish taco in hand.
“Hey Ma, thank you,” he told 
Cameon as he approached her for a hug. “I’m feeling really good right now.”
“You’re welcome,” she said. “I’m 
so happy you’re happy.”
As Lil’ Nikkie walked back out of 
the shelter, still beaming, he praised his new home of about a month.
“I think they give them a bad 
rap,” he said. “I think people are re-ally trying to try.”
“Give them a chance.”
◗ A SECOND ONE IS ON THE WAY.

One year after the introduction of Florida’s 
most powerful supercomputer, UF researchers 
are asking the university for a second one.
Negotiations and planning have begun to 
create a second HiPerGator, one that is bigger 
and faster than its predecessor. Erik Deumens, 
director of research computing at UF, said the HiPerGator’s system is expected to be 70 per-cent full by February.
“The acceptance of HiPerGator has been so 
fast, faster than we projected,” Deumens said. “We plan for HiPerGator 2 to be online in June 2015. That’s when the first one will run out of capacity.”
About 360 faculty members and their re-
search groups have access to the HiPerGator supercomputer, with the total number of users amounting to 1,300. UF spent about $3.4 mil-lion on the first HiPerGator, which was built by UF researchers, Dell, Terascala, Mellanox and AMD. The supercomputer has 16,384 pro-cessing cores and is one of the top 500 super-computers in the world.
The development of a second HiPerGator 
supercomputer will be an acquisition the uni-versity will fund, Deumens said. Faculty will also use their grants to buy pieces of it in order for the university to recover their funds.
The creation of a second supercomputer 
will be an important addition to UF’s preemi-nence plan, which Deumens said has been a strong selling point in hiring new researchers.
“From the feedback of many people we’ve 
hired, almost all of them were very impressed with the infrastructure that UF had in place,” he said.
About 20 new researchers who have been 
hired made their decision to work at the uni-versity based on the HiPerGator, and several more negotiations for new staff are still in progress, he said. Some of the UF research projects using the supercomputer include pre-dicting political elections from data gathered before citizens vote to processing the impact of HIV on the human brain. Once the second HiPerGator launches in June, researchers will 
continue to use the original supercomputer 
until its four-year lifespan expires.
Michael Elliot, a UF computer engineering 
junior, said he’s excited to see the how UF’s research projects turn out with the help of the HiPerGator supercomputer.
“It’s not every day that you hear about a 
supercomputer existing on campus,” said El-liot. “I think it’s probably even rarer to hear about two of them in one place. I think that’s pretty special.”MONDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Performing Arts to listen to a talk given by Stephen A. Smith, an analyst for ESPN. I only went because 
my friend wanted to hear him speak. I texted my broth-er about it, hoping to make him jealous because he loves 
sports. I honestly hadn’t even heard of Smith before this 
event.
I wondered, “What might a sports analyst have to say?” 
I ﬁ  gured he might talk about being a black man in corpo-rate America. I thought it would be a generic motivational speech, but I wasn’t completely sure what his angle would be. Much to my disappointment, Smith’s vitriolic talk was anything but motivational.
Smith has clearly bought into the idea of meritocracy — 
the notion that all success is derived from hard work and that those who are not successful only have themselves to blame because clearly, they did not work hard enough.
The pitfall of meritocracy is that it promotes the idea 
that there are limited resources — social, political and eco-nomic.
At the beginning of his speech, Smith asked who in the 
audience had attended the event with a friend. Most people — myself included — raised their hands only to be yelled 
at. We were told that there are no true friends. According 
to him, we were all sitting beside our competitors, and we had to do everything in our power to perform better than our competitors or they would succeed in the world and we would not.
As the old adage goes, “If you want to go fast, go alone. 
If you want to go far, go together.” It’s clear that Smith has chosen to go alone, as have others who live by the princi-ples of meritocracy. This way of thinking that says a person 
must only look out for himself or herself fails to consider 
the fact that we are all members of a global community and are all members of American society. We are social beings who interact with each other, and often, our actions affect more than just ourselves.
The only time Smith acknowledged that his decisions 
were not standalones was when he told the audience that he would “annihilate” anyone who wanted to take his career from him. The only actions that mattered to him were ones that either elevated his own wealth and status or put down others.
Meritocracy completely par-
dons the oppressive systems that still exist in the U.S. I’ve talked at length in previous columns about how systems such as racism, sex-ism and homophobia must be ad-
dressed and not tiptoed around or ignored. Pretending the U.S. is a completely just nation only harms people who are members of the oppressed communities that are constantly battling social inequality. I had hoped that Smith would ac-
knowledge racism in America and the role it played on his 
journey to success, but he instead encouraged the audience to stop thinking about racism and just focus on working hard.
Hard work is important, but it is not the only thing that 
matters.
I’d challenge Smith to take a look around his own work 
environment and then consider this: Is the lack of people of color in his ﬁ  eld a result of societal disenfranchisement, or 
is it simply that people of color don’t work as hard?
We have to abandon the false security of meritocracy 
that says if we work hard enough, we will make it. “Making 
it,” in this case, means acquiring wealth and living comfort-ably with the freedom to go through life sans oppression.
During his time on stage, Smith said, “I don’t believe I’m 
negative. I believe I’m real.” This is the reality: There are a lot of people who work hard but still don’t reach success as it is usually thought of in the U.S. Instead of believing that 
our actions are the only indicators of whether we’ll make it, 
we need to begin considering all the factors that shape our lives and the lives of others. Once we begin to see the big picture, and not just the details that are our individual ac-tions, we can begin to take collective actions that make life better for all people.
TehQuin Forbes is a UF sociology junior. His columns ap-
pear on Mondays. Hey, Stephen A.: Meritocracy doesn’t workThe partisan makeup of American politics, particularly at the national level, has seen quite a bit of change recently. Congress has transitioned from Democratic dominance to 
Republican control in just six years. 
Through all of the political sea changes, one factor has re-
mained constant: the massive amount of political spending that characterizes American elections.
Somewhat surprisingly, preliminary numbers show that po-
litical spending actually declined on average this year from the midterm elections in 2010.
In 2010, the average House candidate raised about $575,000 
and spent almost as much. For Senate candidates, those num-bers were $2.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
In 2014, although House candidates raised more money on 
average — about $666,000 per candidate — they spent less, about $550,000 each. The same holds true for Senate candidates. They raised more on average than in 2010, but spent slightly less.
Regardless of the exact fundraising numbers, money — par-
ticularly money spent on political advertising — is still the stron-gest determinant of which candidates are elected. Nowhere does that concept ring more true than here in Florida.
The Florida governor’s race between re-elected Republican 
incumbent Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic challenger Charlie 
Crist was the most expensive race in the country in terms of po-
litical advertising.
The Florida gubernatorial race saw more than $98 million 
spent on political advertising, the vast majority devoted to nega-tive advertising seeking to attack opposing candidates.
The fact that Scott out-advertised Crist by a 2-to-1 margin 
may help explain why he was able to achieve re-election, de-spite some of the worst approval numbers of any politician in the entire country.
Political advertising, by and large, serves no constructive 
purpose. Although it can help increase name recognition, the ads often contain deeply misleading information, whether posi-tive or negative. Instead of presenting positive, constructive so-lutions to the issues that concern voters, candidates seek to drag each other into the mud and emerge on Election Day as the least dirty.
The massive increases in political spending also have a harm-
ful effect on the political media. The tendency of American news 
outlets, especially those at the national level, to endlessly cover 
stories about political ads and fundraising causes actual public policy issues to take a back seat to these superﬁ  cial topics.
Some argue that any restrictions on political spending risk vi-
olating the First Amendment rights crafted by the Founding Fa-thers. However, it seems unlikely that the founders envisioned a political environment ﬁ  lled with toxic, negative discourse and unaccountable spending when they wrote the words “freedom of speech.” Regardless of whether action is taken through legis-lation or a constitutional amendment, something must be done to stem the harmful tide of negative political advertising.Political ad

1033 Program is unnecessary 
In an era of unprecedented 
police brutality, I think it is high 
time UF students be informed 
about the ways our own campus 
has become heavily militarized. If you have not yet heard anything about the 1033 Program (I know 
I hadn’t), I urge you to question 
why.
UF is one of many college cam-
puses in the Southeast involved in the 1033 Program, under which 
University Police receives free 
military grade weaponry from the Department of Defense. This includes — but is far from limit-
ed to — assault weapons, SWAT gear and an armored vehicle.  Un-
der no circumstances is this kind 
of equipment warranted on our 
campus, and quite frankly, I feel alarmingly unsafe knowing UPD has it at its disposal. Not to men-tion, who pays for the transporta-
tion of this exorbitant amount of 
weaponry? We do.
Our tuition dollars are fun-
neling into a weapon cache to 
thwart a nonexistent threat, rath-
er than going toward indispens-able resources that could enrich our student life. Fortunately for us, this militarization program 
is entirely optional. UF can opt 
out of it at any time. Students for a Democratic Society is cur-rently campaigning to combat 
the militarization of our campus, 
demanding at the very least full disclosure of the type, quantity and cost of equipment obtained by the program. A rally will be 
held Wednesday on Turlington 
Plaza between 1:40 and 1:55 p.m. to inform the Student Body and petition for demilitarization. This 
is a great opportunity to come 
voice your support for a truly safe, demilitarized campus atmo-sphere.

When President Ba-
rack Obama took of-
fice back in January 
2009, he vowed to have the most transparent administra-
tion in history — a promise he 
continues to make today. On the White House’s website, it says “transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their government is do-ing.” A declaration of this mag-nitude sounds great in a speech 
or on a Sunday talk show, but 
the reality is much more hazy.
Last week, a video surfaced 
from 2013 of one of the archi-tects of the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as “Obamacare,” who said that a “lack of transparency is a huge political advantage” 
and that casting a shadow over 
the truth was essential for the bill to pass. The man who pro-claimed this was Jonathan Gru-ber, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was also the man who helped craft health care reform in Massachusetts, 
known as “Romneycare.”
Let that sink in a little bit 
more. He said that a lack of 
transparency was a huge po-litical advantage to getting Obamacare passed. The ad-
ministration that promised 
to be the most transparent in history was willing to let this slip past its radar because they wanted to create a legacy for Obama. Gruber went on to explain how this transparency was being sidetracked. He said that “This bill was written in a 
tortured way to make sure (the 
Congressional Budget Office) did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the man-date as taxes, the bill dies.”  
In layman’s terms, they had 
to cover up the fact that the Af-fordable Care Act relies on tax-ing people to achieve its goals. 
To be granted approval from 
the public, the administration was willing to lie to us about what the bill really would do because for this administration, the ends justify the means.
Gruber wasn’t finished. 
During this 2013 Pennsylva-nia conference, Gruber went on to say “And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or what-
ever, but basically that was 
really, really critical to get the thing to pass.” Gruber openly admitted that the bill passed because, well, we were just too stupid to understand what was going on.
I like to give people the 
benefit of the doubt. Maybe he 
made an off-the-cuff remark, 
something he doesn’t really think. It happens to all of us. Then a second video at a dif-ferent venue came out with him saying something similar. OK. Maybe he still made a mis-take. But, alas, there is a third video where Gruber says that “It’s a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.” He was re-ferring to a plan that then-Sen. 
John Kerry of Massachusetts 
was pushing for, where expen-sive health insurance plans, known as “Cadillac plans,” would have a tax levied on the insurance companies. Unfortu-nately, as Gruber pointed out, these companies would simply just push these extra expenses 
onto individuals to help cover 
the costs, as most taxes work, so essentially, it was another tax on the American people.
Clearly, Gruber thinks that 
we are all idiots who wouldn’t have understood what was happening as a result of the Affordable Care Act’s imple-
mentation, so it was better for 
the administration to cover up the truth behind its health care overhaul. And Obama bought into it. During an interview with George Stephanopoulos back in 2009, Stephanopoulos hounded Obama over the man-date, explaining that it is just a 
tax. Obama circumnavigated it 
and refused to accept it as a tax. When asked for the final time if the mandate was a tax, Obama replied, “I absolutely reject that notion.”
It is astounding that we 
have a president who is will-ing to lie to us for political 
gain. Now with these remarks 
from Gruber making it on the news, the administration has to start cleaning it up. In an attempt to portray Gruber as an outsider who had no influ-ence on this law, House Minor-ity Leader Nancy Pelosi stated during a conference that she 
doesn’t know who he is and 
that “He didn’t help write our bill.” Pelosi seems to have for-gotten that she mentioned him back in 2009, by name, for his contribution to the Affordable Care Act.
While the White House 
does damage control, they can-
not fix the stubborn fact that 
the Affordable Care Act is not what they want us to believe. A lack of transparency was vi-tal for it to be accepted. When Obama says he has the most transparent administration in history, they are simply just empty words, leaving his ad-
ministration with little to no 
integrity.

Obama: Hiding the 
truth for health careColumn
This month marked my second Vet-
erans Day as a veteran of conflict, and I found myself reflecting on 
this national holiday. I see my uncles and grandfather, who have fought for freedom and opportunity for all Americans in ev-ery war since World War II. And I see my students, 
the unknowing beneficiaries of such sacrifices, grow-
ing into the leaders who will carry America into the future — if only they can first master their eighth-grade science concepts.
I’m not your traditional teacher. As an undergradu-
ate student at UF, I understood that the world was full of opportunities, if only I reached out to seize them. I joined the Army ROTC to be a part of something ex-traordinary, and it was as I was graduating and em-
barking upon a new career with Amazon.com that I 
received my orders. Seemingly overnight, I went from a fresh-faced student to a lieutenant running convoy 
security in Afghanistan.
These experiences have colored the way I approach 
my life and career. When I returned from deployment, 
the private sector no longer held the same appeal. Like many veterans, I am dedicated to strengthening my 
country — so when I learned about the educational 
crisis happening within our own borders, I knew my next mission.
As I began my school year in Oklahoma, there were 
more than 800 classroom vacancies across the state, a statistic with alarming implications for the quality of education for thousands of students. Tapping into the enormous potential of each of my students requires talented and devoted educators who will stop at nothing to provide their 
students with an excellent education.
This fall, I joined Webster Middle 
School, part of Oklahoma City’s South-
side community, as a Teach For America corps mem-ber. And while my past experiences may differ from 
those of my colleagues, I’ve found these experiences invaluable in the classroom. My military background has contributed to promptness and structure, which creates an environment of achievement. And my 
professional experience is used every day when my 
students and I practice tough love and leadership. I may be far from traditional, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.
Veterans have so much to contribute to our coun-
try. Our desire to serve doesn’t end with our military service, and our breadth of experience — from our 
multicultural work environment to our training in 
conflict resolution — is invaluable to helping shape America’s future leaders.
As we honored past contributions this Veterans 
Day, let’s also keep in mind all the ways our heroes 
continue to give. Regardless of the path to the class-
room, serving in education is an indispensable contri-bution to our collective well-being and safety. I thank my fellow veterans in this mission.

As a high school student, Amanda Mey-
ers watched her big brother, Ben Meyers, get 
sworn in as UF Student Body president in 2011.
Now, as the new District E Senator, another 
Meyers is in the UF Student Senate.
The UF criminology junior saw an empty 
seat in her district and applied. Meyers lives in Newberry, although the Senate qualified her as far enough outside of the campus to repre-sent students living outside Alachua County. She was sworn in Oct. 28.
“I really wanted to get involved with sen-
ate,” the 20-year-old said. “Seeing my brother do it, it kinda made me excited.”
Meyers said she’s not sure what party she 
plans on slating with but said it would prob-ably be the Swamp Party.
“I think it’s hard to get representation for 
District E because we are so far away,” she said.UF Senate President 
Joseph Michaels said Mey-ers’ involvement as vice president of UF’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Student Council made her 
a strong candidate for Dis-trict E.
“Additionally, she ex-
pressed the desire to be a strong voice for Dis-trict E students and an enthusiasm to address concerns of students in District E, most of who commute to and from campus regularly,” Mi-chaels wrote in an email.
Meyers said a major issue for students in 
her district is feeling safe while waiting for buses and walking through the commuter lot. She said she plans on working to add more blue lights to make students feel safer.
Nicole Outler, 20, echoed Meyers’ concerns 
about the blue lights.
“She’s really passionate about this (blue 
lights) and really wants to do a good job,” the UF anthropology junior said.

The online business site ranked universities by the colleges’ revenue, NCAA championship score, average home football attendance, average home men’s basketball attendance and student survey responses.
Chip Howard, executive associ-
ate athletic director for the Universi-ty Athletic Association, said UF was the only athletic program regarded as top 10 for the last 31 years.
“We want to deliver a champion-

UF researchers have found a way to begin 
the process of treatment for an intestinal virus 
most commonly found on cruise ships.
By growing the live norovirus in a culture 
dish at UF, medical professionals may be able 
to create new medications and treatment for 
the virus.
The virus, which causes vomiting and di-
arrhea, can be contagious for three days after symptoms fade.
There is no medication available for the vi-rus, but by growing the live virus, researchers can now test new treatments that could soon be available to the public.  
Stephanie Karst, an  associate professor in 
the department of molecular genetics and mi-crobiology in the UF College of Medicine, said testing on mice led to critical clues in develop-ing the human norovirus cell culture system.
“The only source of human norovirus is 
stool from an infected individual,” Karst wrote in an email. “We applied a virus-positive stool sample onto human B cells and then analyzed 
for viral replication over a 5 day period.”
According to the Center for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, norovirus alone has been 
responsible for 19 to 21 million cases a year and even caused 570 to 800 deaths. With this new information, the numbers could decrease.
“For the first time, we can screen antiviral compounds for activity against noroviruses in a relevant cell culture system,” Karst wrote. 
Jordan Steckler, a UF linguistics junior, said 
she has heard of the virus and is glad to hear the correct steps are being taken to get it under control.
“I remember hearing about an outbreak 
of this virus on a cruise ship, and they had to send the ship back because it was spreading so fast,” the 21-year-old said. “I’m glad the research is being done in order to keep this under control and prevent others from getting sick.” UF researchers develop new treatment for intestinal virusSTuDENT govErNmENT
◗ SHE WOKE UP LIKE THIS.

About 100 people gath-
ered Friday night to listen to a 
woman talk about being trans-gender, while also channeling Beyoncé with her confidence.
“I woke up with an essence 
of fabulousness,” Janet Mock, a transgender activist, feminist and writer, said to the crowd at Pugh Hall.
Students laughed, clapped 
and snapped their fingers as Mock answered questions about her newly released book, 
“Redefining Realness,” and her 
struggle for representation.
“I don’t live my life based 
on other people’s perceptions of me,” she said.
During the event for UF’s 
transgender week, sponsored in part by LGBT Affairs, Pride Student Union and Black Stu-
dent Union, Mock spoke about 
how she doesn’t feel included in any minority group because she has such a unique identity.
Without her upbringing in 
Hawaii, an inclusive, diverse place, and her role models like Beyoncé and Destiny’s Child, she said she would have never 
become the person she is today.
“They were one of the little 
mini-mirrors in the kaleido-scope wall of what I wanted to 
look like,” she said. “ I grew up in a space where I learned that there are things beyond male and female, beyond black and white, beyond masculine and feminine.”
She said she believed instead 
of there being a third gender like “other,” there should be a blank space where people can fill in their genders, but most people are not ready for that.
“I would love a blank space 
where people can just fill their gender in, like unicorn,” she 
said.
Charles Ely, who graduated 
from UF last year, said attend-
ing the talk was worthwhile.
“The biggest thing that I like 
is that UF is actually putting on events where we can meet these trans women, like, we get to meet real activists,” the 
23-year-old said.
Mock also discussed the 
problems with the media’s por-
trayal of transgender people and their focus on their “before and after” appearances.
Collin Verney, president 
of Pride Student Union, said he thought it was great to end 
transgender week with Mock.
“I think it really displayed a 
lot of communities coming to-
gether to rally around this iden-tity of trans women of color,” the 21-year-old psychology and sociology senior said.Transgender activist,

  17-15 (53.1%)where. Coaches often know when 
it’s going to happen — the writing was on the wall in this case, and Muschamp knew it.
“I appreciate the opportunity 
that has been offered to me and my family by Dr. Machen, Jeremy Fo-ley and the University of Florida,” Muschamp said in a release. “I was given every opportunity to get it done here and I simply didn’t win enough games — that is the bottom line. I’m disappointed that I didn’t get it done and it is my responsibil-
ity to get it done.
“I have no bitter feelings, but 
this is a business and I wish we 
would have produced better re-sults on the field. We have a great 
group of players and a staff that is 
committed to this University and this football program. They have handled themselves with class and I expect them to continue to do so. As I’ve said many times, life is 10 percent of what happens to you 
and 90 percent how you respond.”
Saturday wasn’t a dropped 
touchdown or a continuous ma-
chine-gunning of their own foot, but the slow bleed. The conserva-tive approach had fans thinking the game sat too precariously for Florida to escape with a 17-10 win. 
Surely, South Carolina coach 
Steve Spurrier would dial up a trick play and steal this one in the house he named two decades ago. No — this time was different; Florida had the game literally blocked away.
After the game, Spurrier joked 
that he felt old because he had started to feel sorry for Muschamp. Sunday, unprompted, he gave condolences at the formal end of the Will Muschamp era during his opening statement.
“I hate to hear it about coach 
Muschamp. Will’s a good person, I think he’s a very good coach. He’s a bit unlucky as you would say. We all complain about close losses, but he’s had his share of them,” Spur-rier said. “Unfortunately, coaches, we’re all based on whatever your record is and it appears Florida decided that they were going to make a change, but he’s an excel-lent coach.”
Muschamp was a defense-first 
coach in an ecosystem that only be-lieves it can subsist if offense is the natural resource produced. 
To his credit, he tried. Charlie Weis, on paper, seemed 
like a good choice for offensive co-ordinator. It didn’t work. 
Brent Pease, the wonder offen-
sive coordinator from Boise State, the one Alabama was going after too reportedly during that offsea-son, didn’t go too well either. 
This season, Kurt Roper was 
brought in to install an uptempo system and give the offense a mod-ern makeover.
No such thing has happened. 
The perception is Muschamp 
always had a chokehold over the 
offense, asking it to throttle down when the team had a lead — some-thing he has obviously denied, but perception is reality. 
The reality around the program 
is that it hasn’t been better than 104th in the country in yards per 
game in every season except for 
this one, where his Gators are 91st. 
The running game was always 
there, but the ineptitude in the passing game has always made the team one-dimensional and unable to take the next step. 
Muschamp also ran into a buzz 
saw perception-wise because Flori-da State finally got it figured out. 
For all his problems on the field, 
Jameis Winston is a phenom on 
the gridiron and has Florida State 
chugging at a pace that doesn’t seem like it will fall too far off of af-ter he leaves. FSU’s win streak may end, but its talent level won’t drop off completely.
Jimbo Fisher seems like he’ll be 
able to keep bringing in top recruit-ing classes and at least field a top-3 
team in the Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence for years to come, keeping them in at least the national title discussion for the for seeable fu-ture. 
Miami also seems to have solved 
its issue at quarterback as long as quarterback Brad Kaaya continues 
to develop. 
A stud signal caller now needs 
pieces around him to bring Miami 
back to where it needs to be, but this season has been a step in the right direction for the Hurricanes. 
And now, Florida looks like it 
will be playing third fiddle in the state after Muschamp leaves at the 
end of the month, with a quarter-
back position that was prominent-ly in a constant state of turmoil at least until a few weeks ago, leaving weapons like Demarcus Robinson wasted. 
Consider this: Robinson is one 
touchdown catch away from tying a Muschamp era receiving record 
for single season scores at six. 
Florida has not ranked in the 
top 100 in passes attempted since 
Muschamp has been head coach, and has not thrown for more than 2,500 yards in any of the seasons he’s coached (UF isn’t on pace to do so this season either). 
Winston has more touchdowns 
passes through 23 games played than all of Florida’s quarterbacks in the Muschamp era combined.
He wasn’t given a full deck by 
Urban Meyer’s regime, but his staff was never was able to develop what it had plus bring in the right parts to supplement and grow on that side of the ball.
He will do well wherever he 
lands this offseason, and he’ll have a reported $6 million worth of buy-
out money to cushion his fall. If 
it’s coaching, school X is landing a skilled tactician, evaluator and tu-tor of defensive secondary. If it’s television, a network is about to bring in an affable self-deprecating coach with a great sense of humor and good communication skills. 
Will Muschamp will succeed. 
It just wasn’t meant to be in 
Gainesville.

Kan li / alligator Staff
UF athletics director Jeremy Foley (left) and football coach Will Muschamp (right) embrace follow -
ing Florida’s 34-10 win against Vanderbilt on Nov. 8 in Nashville, Tennessee.
Muschamp t imeline
Dec. 11, 2010 — Will Muschamp, who was most recently the 
defensive coordinator for the Texas Longhorns, is named Urban Meyer’s 
successor to the Florida football team by Florida athletics director 
Jeremy Foley.
2011 Season —  Muschamp starts his head coaching career 4-0 
after defeating Florida Atlantic, UAB, Tennessee and Kentucky by a combined 161-36. However, the Gators would drop six of their last eight to finish the regular season 6-6. Florida’s only regular-season wins in the final two-thirds of the season came against unranked Vanderbilt and Furman.
Jan. 2, 2012 — Muschamp earns his first bowl game victory as 
Florida’s head coach, defeating Urban Meyer-led Ohio State 24-17 in the Gator Bowl to finish the season 7-6, a record Muschamp said is “not acceptable at the University of Florida” following the game.
Jan. 11, 2012 — Brent Pease is named Florida’s newest offensive 
coordinator after Charlie Weis opts to become the head coach at 
Kansas.
2012 Season: Florida found success led by a formidable defense, 
special teams and a run-heavy offense, dropping its only regular season 
game to No. 12 Georgia 17-9 on Oct. 27, 2012.
Oct. 6, 2012 — No. 10 UF defeats No. 4 LSU 14-6 in what is 
considered Muschamp’s biggest win as Florida’s head coach.
Nov. 24, 2012 — No. 6 UF defeats No. 10 FSU 37-26 in Tallahassee 
as Florida finishes the regular season 11-1.
Jan 2, 2013 — Florida falls to Louisville in the AllState Sugar 
Bowl. While the Gators finished with an 11-2 record, there was little improvement in offensive production. UF finished 104th in total offense (334.0 yards/game) and 118th in passing offense (146.3 yards/game).
2013 Season: Injuries plagued the Gators throughout the season. 
By season’s end, Florida lost 12 players for the season, including 
quarterbacks Jeff Driskel and Tyler Murphy, running back Matt Jones, 
three starting offensive linemen and defensive tackle Dominique Easley among others.
Nov. 30, 2013 — Foley holds an impromptu press conference prior 
to the Florida-Florida State game expressing his support for Muschamp. “He has a strong work ethic,” Foley said of Muschamp. “I think he has a strong plan on how we’re going to fix this.” Florida lost the game 37-7 to end the season 4-8 — UF’s first losing football season since 1979 — and on a seven-game losing skid.
Dec. 1, 2013 — Offensive coordinator Brent Pease and offensive 
line coach Tim Davis are fired.
Dec. 26, 2013 — In an effort to create a more up-tempo offense, 
Florida hired Duke offensive coordinator Kurt Roper to the same position. In 2013, Roper led the Blue Devils to the 47th best offense in 
the country (426.1 yards/game)
Sept. 10 —  Following Florida’s loss to Alabama — a game in which 
the Gators gave up a program-worst 644 yards — Foley said on a radio show he will give Muschamp the entire season, and he would not 
evaluate Muschamp’s tenure on a single game.
Oct. 20 — After back-to-back home losses to LSU and Missouri, 
Foley released a statement on the school’s website announcing his continued support of the football program. “At the beginning of the season, we said we would evaluate the season as it plays out,” Foley said in a statement. “We will continue to do so.”
Saturday — After winning two straight games on the road, Florida 
loses 23-20 to South Carolina in overtime, dropping its third straight 
home contest and its sixth in eight games. The loss eliminated UF from 
contention to win the SEC East.
Sunday — The school announces that Muschamp will step down as 
head coach following the conclusion of the regular season. florida head coach records since 1990MONDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2014

CLEARED TO PLAY AGAINST MIAMI TONIGHT.
ERICA A. HERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer @EricaAlyssa
After injuring his hand in the first 
three minutes of No. 7 Florida’s 68-
45 season-opener win over William & Mary on Friday, coach Billy Donovan confirmed Sunday that starting red-
shirt junior forward Dorian Finney-
Smith has hairline fractures in his mid-dle and index fingers of his left hand.
Donovan said Finney-Smith is 
cleared to play when Florida (1-0) plays Miami (1-0) tonight at 7. Finney-Smith is still listed as a projected start-er, but Donovan is not expecting much from him tonight because he will be 
wearing a brace. 
Finney-Smith was in significant 
pain, but  he played through the injury 
on Friday to score a game-high-tying 15 points.
“We were all shocked,” point guard 
Kasey Hill said, “but he was playing through it so, I mean we really didn’t think it will be that bad because he kept 
playing through it, but afterwards we 
were shocked.”
But Finney-Smith’s injury isn’t the 
the only hit Florida is taking.
Redshirt sophomore guard Dillon 
Graham will transfer from the Univer-sity of Florida after the fall semester and he will stop competing and prac-ticing with the Gators immediately, 
Donovan said.
Graham played in the final three 
minutes of Florida’s victory against 
the Tribe on Friday. Donovan said Graham approached him last week and alluded to leaving the team.
“I spoke to him and I could sense in 
the middle of the week that this was something he was giving consider-
ation,” Donovan said. “He never said 
to me he wanted to leave. He just felt

A well-rested Florida team took care of business 
Sunday afternoon, defeating Mercer 3-0 at Donald 
R. Dizney Stadium and advancing to the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
The No. 2-seeded Gators had a week and a half 
to prepare for the opening-round match, and it showed.
Passes were crisp, players were organized and 
the team played with energy from start to finish.
Florida dominated possession throughout the 
game, making Mercer chase the ball by putting pass after pass just outside the reach of its defend-ers -— all the while probing for space to get shots away.
And the Gators found that space often, taking 
16 shots to the meager three from the Bears.
After opening the game with a palpable sense 
of urgency, Florida got its first goal in the 19th min-ute from Annie Speese, who put a soaring Tessa Andujar cross into the back of the net.
The Gators took the 1-0 lead to the half and 
returned from the locker room without missing a beat.
Florida locked down Mercer’s offense, allow-
ing only one shot in the entire second half while completely taking over the game.
“I definitely think we had control of the game,” 
Florida coach Becky Burleigh said. “I thought — particularly in the second half — it was really dominant defensively for us, and I think our style of play wore them down a little bit. They were chasing the ball for a really, really long time, and I 
think that’s why it opened up late for us.”
When Mercer wore down, Savannah Jordan 
capitalized.

With Sunday’s news that Will Muschamp 
will not be returning as Florida’s head coach next 
season, it’s time to talk coaching searches. Here are five candidates to replace Muschamp for the 2015 season. Note that all of my candidates have 
head coaching experience at a high level.  
1.) Dan Mullen, Mississippi State: The 
current Mississippi State head coach is the 
obvious No. 1 choice. In his sixth year in Starkville, Missis-
sippi, Mullen assembled the No. 1 team in the country up until Saturday’s loss at Ala-bama.
The former Florida offensive coordinator 
has built State from the ground up —  imag-ine what he’ll be able to do with the talent and resources already at Florida. 
2.) Bob Stoops, Oklahoma: Stoops ini-
tially looked like someone who wasn’t leav-ing Oklahoma any time soon, but now that the Sooners are out of the College Football Playoff hunt, he could jump ship to Florida. 
His success in Norman, Oklahoma, is 
clear — eight Big 12 Championships, a na-tional title in 2000 and a 167-42 record as head coach. 
Stoops was the as-
sistant head coach for Florida during its 
1996 National Title 
winning season, and 
remained on staff until 1998. 
3) Todd Graham, Arizona State: Graham 
has had success — at least winning-wise —  as a head coach pretty much at every cam-pus he has set foot on. Graham had his first stint as a head 
coach in 2006 at Rice, where he went 7-6 and won the Conference USA coach of the year award before being hired by Tulsa the following year. 
He was on staff at Tulsa in 2003 as a de-
fensive coordinator. In four seasons at Tul-sa, he compiled a 36-17 record. After a 6-6 
one-year stop at Pitt in 2011, Arizona State 
picked him up, and in his first year he went 8-5, good to tie for the Pac-12 South title. 
Last season, the Sun Devils went 10-4, 
and won the South division outright. He was also named the Pac-12 coach of the year Five possible coaching candidates to replace Will Muschamp

UF’s Antoinette Bannister looks to pass the ball during Florida’s 84-73 win 
against Jacksonville on Friday in the O’Connell Center.
GRAHAM HALL
Alligator Writer @Graham311
After a preseason that featured a consider-
able focus on the defensive side of the court, 
Florida women’s basketball coach Amanda 
Butler was content with the team’s play in 
the season-opening 84-73 win over Jackson-ville on Friday.
“All in all, there are a lot of positives for 
us to build on,” Butler said. “We’ve got a re-alistic sense of the things we have to work on, primarily our defense, just giving up too many points too easily.”
Butler knows that in order for the Gators 
to win games against Southeastern Confer-ence opponents, the team will have to rotate better defensively.
The Gators allowed the Dolphins to shoot 
3-of-5 in the ﬁ  rst half from long-range, with Florida’s guards repeatedly giving Jackson-ville’s shooters open looks from deep.
With the game competitive until the end, 
Butler was encouraged to see the team close 
out the Dolphins down the stretch and win a 
tough game.
“I thought Jacksonville did a fantastic job, 
showed a lot of ﬁ  ght, a lot of resilience,” But-
ler said. 
“It’s a great team to play against this early 
in the season, and be tested in speciﬁ  c ways…
it’s just going to help us going forward.”
Junior Antoinette Bannister, who led 
Florida’s bench players with 16 points, said the improvements in Florida’s defense were noticeable, crediting the defensive-focused 
“Camp Hector” the Gators did with strength 
and conditioning coordinator Tyler Stuart in the offseason as the cause.
“Everything we do in practice, out of prac-
tice, it challenges our toughness,” Bannister said. 
“Pulling out this game was very big for 
us.”
The Gators get another crack at ﬁ  ne-tuning its defense before the competition improves, with Florida taking on Longwood today at 4:15 in the O’Connell Center. 
The Lancers opened the season with a 
competitive 64-60 loss to Wake Forest, with junior Daeisha Brown scoring 29 points in the defeat.
Along with the early focus on the defen-
sive end, Butler has stated the importance of the Gators out-rebounding its opponent.
Florida outrebounded Jacksonville 41-34 
on Friday, with redshirt senior Kayla Lewis grabbing seven boards and redshirt junior 
Carlie Needles recording six. 
The Gators have another encouraging re-
bounding matchup against a Longwood team 
that features 6-foot guard Khalilah Ali as its 
tallest active player.
Still, Butler knows the key to the team’s 
success lies in its defense. 
If the Gators play with a steady level of 
high defensive intensity, the wins will con-tinue to come.
“The thing we’re the most concerned with 
is our defensive consistency,” Butler said. 
“We’ve got to close the gap a little bit better 
between good possessions.”Florida looks to continue strong 
showing against Longwood today

4) Rich Rodriguez, Arizona: People may 
scoff at Rich Rod as a serious candidate be-
cause of his debacle of a stint at Michigan, but he’s redeeming himself quite impres-
sively at Arizona. 
His Wildcats are currently the No. 15 
ranked team in the country, and are still in 
the mix for the Pac-12 South title. 
Not to mention Arizona is one of the few 
teams that can say it has knocked off Ore-gon two years straight. 
In his time at West Virginia from 2001-
2007, the Mountaineers won four Big East 
titles, and won both BCS Bowl games they 
went to in 2005 and 2007. 
The 2007 victory was after Rodriguez left 
for Michigan, however. 
The Mountaineers also missed out on a 
bowl game just once — in Rodriguez’s first year as head coach. 
5) Dabo Swinney, Clemson: This may 
be a bit of a dark horse candidate, but dark 
horses are fun to talk about. Swinney, cur-
rently in his seventh year as the head coach at Clemson, is best known for his high-powered, record setting offense in 2012 and 2013. 
The season prior in 2011, they won the 
ACC and earned a BCS Orange Bowl berth. From 2011-13, Clemson had a 32-8 record, the most wins in a three-year period in 
school history. Clemson’s blowout loss 
to Georgia Tech on Saturday brings their loss total to three — enough to make Swin-ney say his goodbyes in Clemson and start somewhere new?
like emotionally he was not 
invested and couldn’t under-stand why and he wanted to figure that out.”
On Saturday morning, 
Graham confirmed to Dono-van that he would be leaving the team.
“The last few weeks I 
could see him a little bit un-happy,” Donovan said. 
“I think it got to the place 
like a lot of guys do where they start to grow and be-
come a young man, is this re-
ally what I want, is this really what I want to do.”
Nothing has been said as 
to where Graham will trans-fer.
“My guess is he’ll go 
somewhere and try to play,” Donovan said. “Where that is 
I don’t even think he’s at that 
place right now.”
Donovan broke the news 
to the team during Satur-day’s practice.
“He (Donovan) just said 
he respected his decision, that it would make him hap-py and everybody else re-
spected it too,” Hill said. “He 
(Graham) hasn’t reached out to me, I don’t know about anybody else but I haven’t talked to him yet, but I’m sure he will.”
With two players out and 
Chris Walker still finishing his three-game suspension, Florida’s matchup against 
Miami at home tonight just 
got a little tougher.
Miami returns only five 
players from last season while adding nine new names to this year’s roster. Three of Miami’s transfers are eligible to play this season: Sheldon McClellan of Texas, Angel 
Rodriguez of Kansas State 
and Joe Thomas of Niagara. All three are projected starts against Florida.
“Well they’re going to 
keep getting better, I think Jim’s (Larranaga) teams have always gotten better,” Dono-van said. 
“But they’re probably a 
lot like us. We lost four start-ers and we’re kind of work-ing on gelling and meshing and playing together. They had a whole new group of guys with McClellan sitting out and Rodriguez so they’ll 
figure out as well. Hopefully 
the game is a game for both teams that it’s going to move us both forward to becoming better.”hit the post early in the second half — Jordan finally broke through, striking a ball past the keeper from 15 yards out in the 82nd minute to give the Gators the breathing room they needed.
“I think that was kinda the goal 
that really broke them, and kinda caused them to fold over,” Jordan said. “Getting that is always great.”
But just to make sure, Jordan 
added her second goal of the game  and 17th of the season in the 90th minute.
With Florida holding Mercer 
goalless, Taylor Burke tied the school record with her 27th career solo shutout.
“Obviously throughout the whole season and throughout my entire career I’ve had a fantastic 
team in front of me and a fantastic 
defense as well,” Burke said, “so it’s definitely nice to get a shutout today and start the NCAA Tournament off right.”
With the win, Florida will ad-
vance and face California in the second round of the NCAA Tourna-ment on Friday.MONDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

◗ THE GATORS CLAIMED 
A SHARE OF THE SEC TITLE WITH THE WIN.
STAFF REPORT
The No. 7 Florida vol-
leyball team defeated No. 15 
Kentucky in four sets (25-19, 14-25, 25-21, 25-16) on Sun-day in Lexington, Kentucky, 
to clinch a share of the South-
eastern Conference title.
The Gators (21-3, 15-0 SEC) 
hit .286 as a team, while lim-iting the Wildcats (23-5, 12-3 SEC) to a .240 clip.
Freshman middle blocker 
Rhamat Alhassan and sopho-more right-side hitter Alex 
Holston led Florida with 15 
kills apiece and hitting per-centages of .478 and .344, respectively. Junior outside hitter Gabby Mallette also re-corded 6 kills.
Junior setter Mackenzie 
Dagostino racked up 47 as-sists, and senior back-row players Holly Pole and Tay-
lor Unroe combined for 19 of 
Florida’s 44 digs.
“There are so many piec-
es to this victory because so many different players con-tributed to this win,” coach Mary Wise said in a release. “To beat a top-25 team on the road, that’s what it takes.”
The Gators have three 
more SEC matches remain-ing — at Ole Miss on Friday, at Arkansas on Sunday and the regular-season home ﬁ  -nale against South Carolina on Nov. 26. Florida volleyball

Alligator Staff @B_murph4
The Florida men’s and wom-
en’s cross country teams reached 
the ﬁ  nish line of their 2014 season Friday morning. 
The teams had previously 
hoped to live up to the expecta-tions from last season, where the Gators were able to reach the NCAA Championship on the men’s side along with two indi-vidual runners from the women’s side. 
With both feats out of reach 
this season, coach Paul Spangler 
instead focused his teams on im-
proving on this season’s disap-pointing performances. 
“Both teams did better, a lot bet-
ter than two weeks ago,” Spangler said. “I thought we did a much better job than we did at the SEC Championships. With that being said, we are not satisﬁ  ed with our result and we need to get better.”For the men, the team ﬁ  nished 
eighth overall, seven spots behind region winner Ole Miss. 
On the other 
side, Florida’s women rounded out the top ﬁ  ve — four places behind a Van-
derbilt team that claimed its ﬁ  rst regional championship in pro-gram history.
The women’s team failed 
to send a runner to the NCAA Championship for the ﬁ  rst time in the last nine years. 
For a team comprised of mostly 
freshmen and sophomores, the fo-
cus turns to improving the team 
for the future. 
Despite the unenthusiastic 
team results, the Gators were en-couraged with numerous signs of improvement from both sides, as 11 of the 14 Florida runners ﬁ  n-ished the race with personal-best times. Sophomore Taylor Tubbs and 
redshirt freshman Becky Greene both placed in the top-25 indi-vidually for the women’s team. The duo earned All-South Region honors with their performances. Redshirt Lauren Brasure’s time of 
20:35 in the 6k was the fastest time 
recorded by a Florida freshman at an NCAA Regional event.
“I thought Taylor and Becky 
ran very well, and I am proud of them for earning All-Region hon-ors,” Spangler said. “...I thought Lauren Brasure did a great job coming off an off race at the SEC 
Championships. She had a very 
good run to end her year.”
Redshirt sophomore Mac Reyn-
olds led the men’s squad with a time of 31:36 in the 10k. Elliot Clemente, Thomas Howell, Carlos Miranda, and David Kilgore all cracked the top 75. 
At-large bids for the 2014 
NCAA Championships were re-vealed Saturday, with neither Florida team receiving a call to run in Indiana this weekend at the NCAA Championship.
