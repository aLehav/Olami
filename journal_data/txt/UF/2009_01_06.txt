While the Gators clash with the 
Oklahoma Sooners in Miami, much 
of the Gator Nation will party on University Avenue.
And with a captive audience, bars, 
clubs and eateries along University 
will be making the most of the national 
championship game on Thursday.
Many of the bars will raise their drink 
prices during the game, and the Florida Book Store already has championship shirts in stock.
Gator City Sports Grill is charging $50 per ticket for reserved seating next to their two big-screen projectors. To avoid the fee, customers can stake out 
their seats hours in advance.
When the Gators won their last na-
tional title in 2007, the seating sold out two days in advance, said Brad Bierman, 
general manager at Gator City Sports Grill.
The restaurants and bars will also 
assume the risk of playing host to hun-dreds of drunken fans.

Relaxing at the Reitz
Students enjoy the nice weather Tuesday afternoon by relaxing on the grassy ar -
eas in the Reitz Union Amphitheater facing the Reitz Union duck pond, which is 
the site of the newly installed University of Florida Veterans Memorial Fountain.
n 10,000 FANS ARE EXPECTED TO 
WATCH THE GAME IN THE O-DOME.

UF fans stuck in Gainesville for the BCS 
National Championship Game don’t have 
to stay at home.
Students, faculty and other Gator foot-ball fans can congregate at the O’Connell 
Center, Orange & Brew or the Grand Ballroom in the Reitz Union to watch the Gators match up against the Oklahoma 
Sooners.
“I went to the O-Dome for the last foot-
ball championship game and I can only 
describe it as pure chaos,” said UF sociol-
ogy junior Courtney Gallow. “It was un-
believable to be there with thousands of students screaming all at once. You feel a 
certain pride for going to this school and 
for being a Gator.”Game coverage starts at 8 p.m., and 
kickoff is expected at 8:17 p.m., according to a UF press release. 
Inside the O’Connell Center, the foot-
ball game will be shown on four large video boards. 
Doors will open at 4 p.m. for the

In line with international protests 
on the issue, the controversial attacks 
in the Gaza Strip have sparked reac-
tions from UF students on both sides of the spectrum.  
Jonathan Bull, vice president of ex-
ternal relations for Islam on Campus, 
said his main concern is the treatment 
of the people of Gaza.
“It’s an open-air prison,” he said. “They’re receiving no aid.” 
Although Islam on Campus is a re-
ligious organization and not political, the executive board will meet later this week to discuss what actions they plan 
to take.
 “All I want is to see an end to it,” 
Bull said, “and for Palestinian people 
to live normal lives, and 
Israeli people to not have 
fear in their lives.” 
Sharday El-Assar, a 
Middle Eastern studies senior, has 
protested the attacks for the past three 
days.

“We’d love be able to do the 
$100 million for this program, but 
that just isn’t presented to us,” 
Crist said. “So we have to live 
within our means, yet still be cre -
ative and try to do things that give 
small businesses in particular a 
greater opportunity to not merely 
survive but to try to thrive.”
The goal is to start small and 
convince lawmakers to increase 
the loan program in the future, 
said Dale Brill, who heads the state 
economic development office.
“Test now, prove the concept 
and then you know it’s something 
that works,” Brill said.
Businesses are struggling to 
expand because banks aren’t lend -
ing much money right now, Brill 
said. The program would target 
high-performance companies that 
would promise to create a certain 
number of jobs if they receive the 
loan. Those that fall short of the 
goal would pay penalties.
“We need to give them money 
to prove that if we could just un -
lock this capital market, that that’s 
one of the things that’s really hold -
ing back growth in this state and 
it will create jobs for Floridians,” 
Brill said.
Crist and Brill made their pre -
sentation to members of economic 
development groups from around 
the state. The idea was well re -
ceived.

Crist proposes $10 million 
tourism program
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — More 
than 30 businesses having trou -
ble getting loans in today’s tight 
credit market could get state help 
under a pilot program that Gov . 
Charlie Crist wants lawmakers 
to approve.
Crist and the head of the 
state’s Office of Tourism, Trade 
and Economic Development out -
lined the idea for a group of eco -
nomic development leaders at 
the governor’s mansion Tuesday . 
The Republican governor asked 
for help persuading the GOP-
controlled Legislature to pay for 
the $10 million program at a time 
when lawmakers are slashing 
the budget by $2.3 billion.
Some Democrats denounced 
the plan, saying it doesn’t 
make sense to put millions into 
an unproven program while 
Republicans are trying to cut 
Visit Florida, the state’s tourism 
promotion agency , by up to $12.9 
million — about half of its total 
budget.
Visit Florida “is a proven 
commodity that generates rev -
enue,” said Rep. Joe Gibbons, a 
Hallandale Beach Democrat who 
sits on the House committee that 
oversees tourism spending. “I’m 
going to invest in something that 
works.”
Sen. Mike Fasano, a Spring 
Hill Republican who chairs the 
Senate panel that oversees eco -
nomic development spending, 
defended the loan plan.
“Why not help the small busi -
nesses in our community that 
want to expand and are looking 
to hire people?” Fasano said. 
“Visit Florida doesn’t create 
jobs.”
Businesses that show growth 
potential and employ between 
10 and 99 people would be eli -
gible for loans of up to $250,000 
at a 2 percent interest rate if they 
guarantee they will create jobs.
At least 34 businesses could 
be helped by $8.5 million in 
loans. Another $1.5 million 
would be used to provide techni -
cal assistance to businesses seek -
ing to grow. Crist said he wanted 
more money for the program, 
acknowledging that $8.5 million WHAT’S HAPPENING

Fla. man, daughter
charged with incest 
BUNNELL, Fla. — A Florida 
man and his daughter have been 
charged with incest after eyewit -
ness statements that they were 
having a sexual relationship, au -
thorities said Tuesday.
Alton Everett Smith and his 
wife Tina Marie Smith already 
each face 37 counts of possessing 
child pornography.
After being on the lam for a 
week, Alton Everett Smith was ar -
rested Monday and is being held 
at the Volusia County jail on a total 
of $950,000 bond. Kristilyn Smith 
was arrested Tuesday on an in -
cest charge and is in jail on $25,000 
bond, a jail official said.
The names of their attorneys 
were not immediately known.
Investigators who searched the 
house where the three were living 
said they found several hundred 
photos, CDs, VHS tapes and 8mm 
videos taken over a decade with 
most showing children posed in 
sexual positions.
Maj. David O’Brien of the 
Flagler County Sheriff’s Office said 
some photographs show children 
as young as 8 years old engaging 
in various sex acts, while others 
show Smith and his wife engaging 
in sexual acts with minors.
Alton Everett Smith has told in -
vestigators he’s not the monster the 
news is making him out to be and 
has denied taking inappropriate 
pictures of children and disputed 
reports that there are tapes of him 
having sex with minors.

Former governor has no 
plans to take Senate seat
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former 
Gov. Jeb Bush announced Tuesday 
that he won’t run for the U.S. 
Senate in 2010 to replace the retir -
ing Mel Martinez, saying that it 
was not the right time to return to 
elected office.
“I can play a role in helping to 
reshape the Republican Party’s 
message and focus on 21st century 
solutions to 21st century prob -
lems,” Bush told The Associated 
Press in a phone interview. “Not 
running does not preclude me from 
being involved in these things and 
I will be.”
Bush seriously considered a run 
after Martinez said last month he 
wouldn’t seek a second term. Bush 
spoke with senators, supporters 
and family , including his brother, 
President George W. Bush, and his 
father, former President George 
Bush.
He said his decision wasn’t 
based on politics but on his “per -
sonal journey.” He said his broth -
er’s low approval rating didn’t fac -
tor into his decision.

governor is people get to know 
you, and I think people know I

GAINESVILLE CITY COMMISSION COUNTY COMMISSION TO 
READDRESS APPLICATION 
CRITERIA ON FEB. 3.
By MORGAN COLLINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Alachua County 
Commission reviewed how non -
profit programs designed to 
reduce poverty receive county 
funding but agreed to keep fund -
ing limits in place at a special 
meeting Tuesday at the County 
Administration Building.
Programs sponsored by non-profit agencies with a 501(c)(3) 
tax-exempt status receive funding 
through the county’s Community 
Agency Partnership Program.
 To receive funding, agencies 
can propose up to two programs 
for either poverty reduction or art 
and culture enrichment for un -
derprivileged residents.
Each program can receive up 
to $75,000. 
The Commission voted to 
keep the funding limits in place 
but wanted to review the process 
used to approve agencies’ pro -
grams.
Agencies must attend a pre-application workshop, submit a 
written application and give an 
oral presentation for funding ap -
proval.
Between the written applica -
tion and oral presentation, there 
are 15 criteria 
the advisory 
board uses to 
assess eligi -
bility for funding, one of which is 
proposed budgets for programs.
Commissioner Rodney Long 
expressed doubts about a propos -
al from the partnership program 
to weigh budget proposals heavi -
er than other application criteria.“Weight becomes subjective to 
people, especially when funding 
is competitive,” he said.
There were also concerns about 
the way funding is disbursed. 
Currently, the partnership pro -
gram gives different percentages 
of the $75,000 limit to agencies 
based on scores from the applica -
tion process.
Commissioner Mike Byerly 
suggested an “all-or-none” sys -
tem, with a smaller number of 
total agencies receiving the full 
$75,000 instead of many agencies 
receiving different percentages of 
funding.“It’s about the programs, not 
the agencies,” he said. “Not ev -
erybody gets a little something.”
Other commissioners, includ -
ing Commissioner Cynthia Moore 
Chestnut, disagreed with the all-
or-none approach.
Chestnut said agencies skilled 
in grant writing may receive pref -
erential treatment over less so -
phisticated agencies with equally 
beneficial programs. 
The Commission agreed to dis -
cuss criteria for funding, as well 
as further expenditure limits for 
poverty reduction programs, at a 
later meeting on Feb. 3.Commission upholds funding limits for nonprofits

Despite a dwindling budget, the 
Gainesville City Commission will still focus 
on purchasing conservation land and reno -
vating public buildings in the new year.
Budget proposals won’t be announced 
until the summer, but the souring national 
economy leads officials to expect deeper 
budget cuts.
Still, Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan said she wants to help maintain the quality of life for 
Gainesville residents. 
“I’m cautiously optimistic,” Hanrahan 
said of the coming year.
Last year, the city was able to trim about 
$2 million from the budget, she said. Still, 
officials  continue to face tough decisions re -
garding cutting costs and raising revenue.
One way Commissioner Jeanna 
Mastrodicasa wants to increase city funds 
is by tackling underage drinking in restau -
rants and bars.A proposed ordinance would force bars 
and restaurants with too 
many underage drinking 
arrests to deny entry to 
patrons under 21 after 9 
p.m. This would decrease 
the number of bar patrol 
officers.
“It’s an economic incen -
tive to manage underage 
drinking and reduce police 
costs,” said Mastrodicasa, who is also UF’s vice president of student affairs. Despite 
cost-saving measures like the proposed or -
dinance, public service departments are not 
immune from budget shortfalls.
Services like fire and police departments, 
which Mastrodicasa said are usually safe 
from budget cuts, will now be re-examined.
Mayor Hanrahan said managing the bud -
get is difficult, but she is ready to rise to the 
challenge.
“The end goal is to continue to make 
Gainesville a great place to live,” she said.Officials set goals for land conservation, renovations

Some of UF’s roads got a 
makeover during winter break.
After most students scattered 
home for the holidays, five sec -
tions of road were resurfaced, 
which cost UF a total of $993,000.
It was the most significant re -
surfacing on the main campus in 
the last ten years, said Jeff Bair, 
project manager for the Physical 
Plant Division. 
The sections that were repaved 
are Stadium Road from Gale 
Lemerand Drive to Pugh Hall, 
Buckman Drive from Pugh Hall 
to University Avenue, Newell 
Drive from Museum Road to 
Union Road and two sections 
of Museum Road: from Radio 
Road to Village Drive and from 
Gale Lemerand Drive to Beaty Towers.
The roads had not been resur -
faced in more than 20 years, Bair 
said.
The new resurfacing should 
last 25 years or more, he said. 
Bair said the project began 
on Dec. 19 and was completed 
Saturday. 
Crews should 
be finished reap -
plying the stripes, 
crosswalks and with other finish -
ing touches within a month, Bair 
said.
Bair also said UF plans to re -
place the concrete dividers that 
separated the bicycle lanes from 
regular traffic on Stadium Road 
and Buckman Drive.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Roland Burris failed 
to capture President-elect Barack Obama’s old 
Senate seat Tuesday in a wild piece of political the -
ater, but the Democrats’ opposition cracked when 
a key Senate chairwoman said seating him was 
simply the legal thing to do.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein rejected the reasoning 
that all of the chamber’s Democrats, herself in -
cluded, had cited in a letter last week — that cor -
ruption charges against Burris’ patron, Illinois 
Gov. Rod Blagojevich, tainted his appointment.
“Does the governor have the power, under law, 
to make the appointment? And the answer is yes,” 
said Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Rules 
and Administration Committee, which judges the 
credentials of senators.
Burris marched into the Capitol Tuesday, de -
claring himself “the junior senator from the state 
of Illinois.” But Secretary of the Senate Nancy 
Erickson rejected his certification, as he knew she 
would, saying it lacked Illinois Secretary of State 
Jesse White’s signature and the state seal.
Late Tuesday, Feinstein urged the Senate to 
settle the matter.
“If you don’t seat Mr. Burris, it has ramifications 
for gubernatorial appointments all over America,” the California senator said. “Mr. Burris is a senior, 
experienced politician. He has been attorney gen -
eral, he has been controller and he is very well-re -
spected. I am hopeful that this will be settled.”
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry 
Reid did not immediately respond to a request for 
comment.
Earlier, Reid had said, “Mr. 
Burris is not in possession of the 
necessary credentials from the 
state of Illinois.”
Burris, meanwhile, pivoted 
from his rejection at the Capitol 
to the Illinois Supreme Court, 
asking it to order White to cer -
tify his appointment.
Some of Burris’ supporters 
have bemoaned the fact that Democrats would 
stand in the way of the Senate gaining its only 
black member. Burris himself downplayed the is -
sue of race, telling reporters: “I cannot control my 
supporters. I have never in my life, in all my years 
of being elected to office, thought anything about 
race.”
“I’m presenting myself as the legally appointed 
senator from the state of Illinois. It is my hope and 
prayer that they recognize that the appointment is 
legal,” he said on CBS’s “The Early Show.”Burris fails to earn Senate seat

 BOWEN HAS TRAVELED 
ABOUT 3,000 MILES SO FAR. 
By CAROLYN TILLO 
Alligator Contributing Writer
Ryan Bowen does not need a 
plane or car to travel from Los 
Angeles to the presidential inau -
guration.
He has his bicycle.
Bowen, a photographer whose 
journey is called Biking for Obama, 
set off on Dec. 2 from Los Angeles for a bicycle ride that will end in 
Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20.
He arrived on Turlington Plaza 
at about 12:30 p.m. Tuesday to 
talk with students about how the 
concepts of hope and change in 
Obama’s campaign are represent -
ed through his bicycle journey.
Bowen said his bicycle is a ve -
hicle for change.
It is an unconventional form 
of transportation, but an environ -
mentally friendly one, he said, 
adding that cycling is a good way 
to stay healthy. Bowen is trying to recruit cy -
clists as he goes.
Megan O’Brien, a UF zoology 
junior who planned to join Bowen 
during his journey to Jacksonville 
on Tuesday, said cy -
cling represents a 
vehicle for change 
because it is both a 
physical and mental endeavor.
She said cycling is the best way 
to communicate your cause.
However, Bowen’s journey does 
not just involve cycling.
Each day, Bowen documents his ride by blogging, shooting photo -
graphs and video interviews with 
his filmmaker, Albert Vazquez.
The interviews that Bowen and 
Vazquez conducted with UF stu -
dents will be included in BET’s 
coverage of the inauguration on its 
Web site. 
Students like UF freshman 
Jacob Smith also introduced them -
selves to Bowen.
Smith, the event coordina -
tor for Students for Change, said 
Bowen’s journey is symbolic of the 
American spirit.Bowen said his journey also in -
volves talking with people about 
the election and their visions for 
Obama’s presidency.
“Maybe all we got is hope, but 
I’d like to see it live further than 
that,” he said.
Bowen, who cycles 80 to 100 
miles each day, has come pretty far 
— about 3,000 miles as of Tuesday.  
The journey offers a liberating 
lifestyle, he said.
“You’re free,” he said. “You’re 
not tied down to such a strict or 
boring form of life.”Cyclist documents journey to Obama inauguration

We’re sorry we had to run a whopping 15 Associated 
Press stories. (We’ve been working here for years and 
that’s the most we’ve ever seen printed in one edition). 
Sorry about the Oklahoma/Oklahoma State confu -
sion on the front page, a mixup that will surely send us to 
Gator fan hell.
Sorry that little “partly cloudy” clip art wasn’t next to 
the indexes on Page 1.
But we realized something last night, sometime be -
tween the server crash at midnight and its eventual resus -
citation at 1:30 a.m.
Maybe they won’t notice the missing weather icon.
Maybe the readers want more AP articles. 
What a lot of our readers may not realize is that it takes 
a hell of a lot of blood, sweat and tears to generate each 
edition of the Alligator. As you may have read last semes -
ter, we’ve had some “issues” (pun totally intended) with 
employee turnover and low morale in the newsroom. 
We’ve had to do some serious brainstorming to try to re -
solve these issues. 
We transformed the newsroom from ‘70s wood panel -
ing hell to something that could arguably be called shabby 
chic. Our secret: six coats of a paint named Cool Elegance, 
a lot of Tegan and Sara sing-alongs and the installation of 
a twin bed in the editor’s office.
(We’re not kidding. There really is a bed in there, and 
we’ve already slept on it).
Even with our improved digs, putting out a paper is no 
easy feat. It involves assigning stories, which have to be reported and written before they go 
through several editors. Photos are 
assigned, snapped and edited. All 
of this happens while you guys are 
sleeping, going to class and watch -
ing The Office.
And it happens every day.
When you factor in a debilitating 
server crash, a staff still in training 
and a paper that would be a feat for 
a full staff to fill, the potential for di -
saster increases by roughly 89 per -
cent (and we suck at math).
But last night, as the entire staff sat assembled at 1 a.m. 
in the production room waiting for the servers to come 
back online, no one was complaining. By the way, the 
deadline for all pages to be sent is 12:50 every night, no ex -
ceptions. Even Rachel, our lone online guru, stayed until 
the bitter end and sleepily published the last story to our 
Web site at 6:30 a.m. — and she’s not doing that again.
For us, not being able to publish both print and online 
versions of yesterday’s paper was not an option.
There are so many things that can and will go wrong, 
but one thing that will never change is our dedication to 
you, the reader.
Please tell us what’s working for you.
Or, if you so desire, come work for us. We’re having an 
open house this Friday from noon to 5 p.m. If you’re inter -
ested in joining us -- and working here is fun, we promise 
– stop in. We can’t wait to meet you.
Nicole Safker is a journalism senior and Editor in Chief 
of the Alligator. Kristin Bjornsen is a journalism junior and 
Managing Editor / Print. Rachel Roy is a journalism junior 
and Managing Editor / Online.Roland W. Burris wants you to know that he’s not 
here looking for drama.
Unfortunately for Burris, the would-be successor 
to President-elect Barack Obama’s Senate seat happened 
to be appointed by that governor whose last name no one 
seems to know how to pronounce.
You know, Illinois Gov. Rod Bla-go-ya-vich.
A few spritzes of “eau du credibility” would do little 
for Burris at this point as he futilely attempts to ward off 
the stench left by beleaguered Blagojevich surrounding his 
appointment.
The Editorial Board believes Burris has an insatiable 
thirst for drama — consumed with a selfish ideology to 
ensure that the empty space on the side of his mausole -
um bears the title of senator long before he takes his final 
breath. 
The grave already informs the world of the many il -
lustrious accomplishments racked up by Burris over the 
course of his political career. 
From Illinois comtroller moving up the ranks to state 
attorney general, the Editorial Board politely tips their 
proverbial caps to Burris for his public service to the peo -
ple from the Land of Lincoln. 
Whether Burris is qualified for the position of U.S. 
Senator is not for the Editorial Board to decide.
All we want is for Burris to take a step back and let the 
law dictate who will assume the seat vacated by Obama. 
He shouldn’t be causing more distractions by showing up 
on Capitol Hill and expecting a seat.
It’s not that some of Burris’ fellow Democrats are delib -
erately giving the man the cold shoulder — rather, they are 
looking out for the health and future of the party, which 
trumps any run-of-the-mill politician with delusions of 
grandeur.
The Editorial Board wonders if Illinois even wants a 
senator who more or less begged for the job by conceding 
he would refrain from seeking re-election?
While Burris may not have “paid to play” like some of 
his fellow Chicagoans, he sure isn’t helping his sleaze quo -
tient as he tries to sneak in the back door in the wake of 
political corruption. 
We are afraid that Burris couldn’t care less about the 
circumstances in which he is seated as the junior senator 
from the state of Illinois.
His obsession with validating his career with the bright 
shiny letters of S–E–N before his name is nothing short 
of unsettling and disappointing — hardly a recipe for the 
African American community’s lone voice in the Senate to 
win over his constituency.
Pushing his own agenda may very well result in Burris 
assuming Obama’s vacant seat, but sadly, he risks demean -
ing his legacy to a fleeting memory of everything that 
transpired before he even steps foot in his plush Senate 
office. 
Burris, whose tombstone boasts the phrase “Trail 
Blazer,” can only save face if he backs off his approach 
of entitlement to the position and humbly acknowledges 
the cloud of uncertainty and scandal surrounding Gov. 
Blagojevich. 
If not, it won’t be long before the Senate plays musical 
chairs again and Burris finds himself without a seat.6, ALLIGATOR   WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7, 2009

Conflict coverage biased
The entire Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict is a very divisive topic in contemporary American society.
Religious preference, ethnicity, 
political affiliation and social sta -
tus often define and pervade the 
deep rifts that characterize this 
60-year-old dispute.
The current situation involv -
ing the Israeli bombardment and 
incursion into Palestinian terri -
tories has undoubtedly agitated 
many strongly held beliefs and 
emotions on all sides of the con -
flict.
On page 13 in yesterday’s 
Alligator there was an Associated 
Press wire story describing 
Israel’s refusal to accept any calls for a cease-fire that also ran with 
a picture.
The story was well balanced, 
but the picture — which showed 
an Israeli child looking at dam -
age done to a building by Hamas 
rocket fire — editorialized other -
wise fair and balanced coverage 
of a major world event. 
This picture undeniably did a 
poor job capturing the Palestinian 
point of view of the conflict and 
totally ignored the suffering of 
Gazans. 
It is important to note that be -
fore the current Israeli military 
operation even started, there had been a brutal 1 1/2-year Israeli 
blockade imposed on the entire 
Gaza Strip.
Other than for intermittent aid 
provided by the United Nations, 
this blockade did not allow any 
food supplies, medicine, gas or 
monetary aid to be delivered to 
the Gaza Strip. 
Now, on top of the blockade’s 
effects on the Gazan civilian 
population — and on the heels 
of Israel breaking its agreement 
to a  cease-fire with Hamas — 
the heavy Israeli shelling has 
killed more than 550 Palestinians 
and injured 2,500 other Gazans, including 200 civilians. Many 
of those injured or killed were 
women and children. 
Moreover, through this unbal -
anced coverage, the voices and 
points of view of many UF stu -
dents were marginalized and left 
in the dark. 
In the future, the entire 
Alligator staff must be more 
sensitive to alternative points of 
view and provide its readers with 
increased fairness and balance 
when it comes to such discordant 
issues.

Taking the covers off stigma, shame of female masturbation
Once when I was 14, I was playing 
cards with the neighborhood boys, 
and they started talking about mas -
turbating. Actually, I think they referred to 
it as “slapping the salami.” When I shared 
one of my own stories about masturbat -
ing, their reaction was something between 
erotic shock and disgust.
Not much has changed since then. The 
whole topic of masturbation is a social ta -
boo.
While our culture is clearly capable of 
carrying out open discussions about most 
forms of sex — vaginal, anal, casual, good 
and bad — masturbation, or sex with 
yourself, is virtually excluded from most 
conversations.
And while masturbation is expected of 
men (consider all the slang terms that ex -
ist to describe it), it’s often portrayed as a 
shameful, pathetic activity for women.
In fact, the only time it ever seems en -
couraged for females is if they’re doing it 
to enhance sex with a partner. Read the sex 
advice sections of women’s magazines like 
Self, Cosmopolitan and Glamour. 
The most common published motive for masturbating 
is to learn how to 
achieve an orgasm 
and then transfer 
this knowledge to 
intercourse.
But there’s nothing on masturbating 
just because you want to.
When’s the last time you heard a girl 
say, “Well, I was horny, and I just felt like 
masturbating”? 
The only time I ever hear girls talk 
about masturbating is when they admit to 
engaging in mutual masturbation or using 
it as a sleep aid.
Ahem. So here’s to breaking the mold.
I won a vibrator at a Passion Party last 
term - battery-operated, green and phallic. 
And I use it. It’s not a deeply emotional 
experience for me. 
I don’t do the whole bubble bath, 
candlelight thing. It’s more like a snack - 
something to do because I have an appe -
tite for it, and it satisfies.
Laugh all you want, but as Woody Allen 
famously said, “Don’t knock masturba -
tion; it’s sex with someone I love.” And that’s more than can be said about many 
other forms of sex.
In fact, when you think about it, it’s 
amazing that masturbation isn’t widely 
encouraged. They never said it during 
the sex education I had in middle school, 
but it’s the safest sex you can have. After 
all, there’s absolutely no chance of getting 
pregnant, and it’s impossible to contract a 
sexually transmitted infection.
But remember all the rumors and as -
sumptions that floated around about mas -
turbation in grade school? 
People who admitted to doing it were 
considered perverts. Some said you’d go 
blind. Even worse, some were told by par -
ents or religious leaders who caught them 
in the act that masturbating was a sin that 
would send them straight to hell.
The myths might be broken by educa -
tion, but the stigma still lingers. 
As easily as we engage in dialogues 
about intercourse and oral sex, how many 
of us are openly willing to admit to hav -
ing healthy sexual relationships with our -
selves?
Not many. While it’s socially assumed and ac -
cepted that virtually all men masturbate, 
on average, 60-70 percent of women admit 
to partaking in self-pleasure (keyword: ad -
mit). 
When it comes to masturbation, the 
subject still makes us shift in our seats.
But masturbation is a healthy expres -
sion of sexuality, and the physical and 
psychological benefits of it deserve recog -
nition. 
It can relieve stress, pain (such as men -
strual cramps or migraines) and increase 
self-awareness; it has even been linked 
with decreasing the risk of cancer. And yes, 
when incorporated into sex with a partner, 
it can make foreplay and intercourse bet -
ter. But best of all, it simply feels good.
So why aren’t we doing it more often 
and talking about it more openly?
Until we’re ready to engage in open 
dialogues about it, the association of it as 
a deviant, pathetic and shameful activity 
will never break, and that’s a shame in it -
self.

“We’ve had enough events 
here that we’ve hopefully learned from our mistakes,” said Mike Taphorn, gen-
eral manager at The Swamp 
Restaurant.
The Swamp will have 20 
security staff members on the floor, 10 more than usual, to handle the crowd, Taphorn said.
Tijuana Flats, along with 
most other bars and restau-rants, won’t be serving beer 
in glass bottles, said David Millis, the restaurant’s kitchen 
manager.
“People like to get drunk 
and fight,” Millis said. “We don’t want to hand out weap-ons.”
All of the establishments 
have been warned by the fire marshal that capacity laws 
will be strictly enforced on 
game night. 
Many of the bars will have 
systems in place to ensure that they don’t breach capacity, which could mean long lines 
for eager fans.8, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7, 2009
University Avenue and 13th Street, El-Assar 
said.
“We’re protesting the killing on either 
side,” El-Assar said. “No matter what started it or what political ideologies there are, we value the human life.” 
Both Bull and El-Assar objected to recent 
media coverage, saying it was biased.  
 “People are saying Hamas started it,” El-
Assar said. “But this didn’t start last week. This is not a fair fight. We have hospitals be-ing bombed and civilians being killed.”
Naomi Fireman, vice president of commu-
nications for the Jewish Student Union, dis-agrees. 
“Israel has every right to defend itself,” 
she said, adding the attacks were not intend-ed to hurt civilians. 
Fireman said people in Israel live in con-
stant fear. Her cousins, who live there, are not allowed to play soccer outside due to the 
constant threat of bombings, she said.
“Parents live in fear for their 
children,” she said.
Fireman said the Jewish 
Student Union has organized a peaceful po-litical rally called “No More Hamas” for Jan. 15 to be held in Turlington Plaza. 
There will be signs and music as well as 
people promoting awareness of the recent 
events. 
Students will also be able to write letters to 
Israeli soldiers and their families.
“This is not a pro-Israel protest,” she said. 
“It is strictly against Hamas.”60 people attend to Sunday protest
Expect high hopes, prices for title gameals with Gator 1 Cards will be ad-
mitted into the O’Connell Center after 5:30 p.m.  
The Reitz Grand Ballroom 
doors will open at 6 p.m. Orange & Brew will be open during its regular hours.  
While Gator fans are mak-
ing plans to attend one of the three venues to watch the game or have game day arrangements of their own, a fraction are mak-
ing the five-hour, 325-mile drive 
to cheer in the stands at Dolphin Stadium.
“Gainesville would definitely 
be the best place for a post-game celebration, but you never know when the Gators will play in the championship again,” said UF graduate student Josh Altshuler. 
“No matter how crazy the streets 
get, there is no replacing seeing your team win in person.”
The same three campus ven-
ues were open for the champion-ship game in 2007 when UF beat Ohio State.
While the O’Connell Center 
has a capacity of 12,000 under 
normal circumstances, about 10,000 fans are expected to attend tomorrow night based on past 
championships.
Because certain areas of the 
O’Connell Center will be blocked off, fewer seats will be available there.
However, the blocked sections 
will ensure all attendees have a good view of the screens, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando. 
Orlando, who 
attended the 
BCS title game in 
2007 in Arizona, overheard the excitement of 
people celebrat-
ing in the streets 
of Gainesville 
via telephone.
“After the game I actually 
called people I knew who were watching in the O-Dome,” he said.
Seeing the team live is pre-
ferred, but being in the O’Connell center is a great option, Orlando said.
Tailgating will not be permit-
ted on campus Thursday to avoid 
distracting students in class and 
so UF facilities can carry on their daily tasks, Orlando said.Few to make Miami drive

UF tight end Cornelius Ingram catches a touchdown pass from quarterback 
Tim Tebow during the first quarter of the Gators’ 59-20 win against FAU.
FOOTbALL

MIAMI — It appeared to be one of 
the misfortunes of sports, one of those 
bad things that happen to good people.
When Cornelius Ingram tore his 
ACL in August, teammates, coaches 
and media members alike felt for the 
senior who always seemed to put his best foot forward.
His speedy recovery coupled with 
freakish athleticism led to rumors that he might return for the BCS National Championship Game, despite the fact that many recoveries from similar inju-ries take up to a year.
But coach Urban Meyer reiterated 
this week that his star tight end will not play against Oklahoma.
“It’s not because we don’t want 
him,” Meyer said. “It’s just not the right thing to do. He’s not healed yet.”
It’s a hard sell to Ingram, who may 
well have circled this date on the calen-dar as something to work toward dur -
ing rehab.
He said he will definitely dress for Ingram to

It’s all uphill from here.
UF (13-2) polished off its non-conference 
schedule Tuesday night with a 95-69 thumping 
of Longwood (7-9) in the O’Connell Center.
The Gators started off slow and took a 10-
point lead into halftime before outscoring the 
Lancers 51-35 after the break.
Nick Calathes once again led the way for 
the Gators, scoring 19 points, grabbing 10 re-bounds and finishing two assists shy of a tri-
ple-double. It was his second double-double 
of the season.
Forward Kenny Kadji scored 14 points 
while shooting 70 percent from the field.
Now, as the Gators turn 
their attention to Saturday’s matchup with Mississippi 
and the start of Southeastern Conference play, they hope 
the freshman will be able to 
provide some much-needed depth in the frontcourt.
“I need to keep getting 
more consistent,” Kadji said. “In high school, you can get away with playing good one day and then just relaxing the next. (In college), you have to be ready every day, and it’s some-
thing I’m working to get better at.”
While Kadji has shown he can provide the 
Gators with minutes off the bench early in the 
season, even he isn’t sure what to expect from 
conference play.
“I have no clue,” Kadji said. “I guess we’ll 
find out Saturday.”
Calathes said that while he has tried to help 
prepare his young teammates for the SEC, they may have to experience it for themselves be-
fore they can fully understand the jump they are about to make.
“The SEC is a lot stronger, a lot taller and a 
lot tougher than the teams we have played so far,” Calathes said. “I think we definitely have a tough task ahead of us.”
UF coach Billy Donovan is also unsure 
about how his team will fare in the coming 
weeks.
“We are very inconsistent,” Donovan said. 
“But I think that is part of this team’s growing 
and maturing process. 
“We have a big challenge ahead of us and 
we need to figure out a way to handle that.”UF turns it on 
in second half
MIAMI — 
If I had to list the reasons why 
I love sports, athletes talking trash 
would certainly rank near the top. It’s 
as much a part of athletics as muscles, 
sweat and egos, but the art of smack talk seems to have fallen by the way-
side lately.
We’re on the eve of a dynamic na-
tional title matchup between No. 1 UF and No. 2 Oklahoma. The game fea-
tures two Heisman Trophy winners and will settle a huge debate between 
the Big 12 and Southeastern confer -
ences for the title of best college foot-
ball league.
But here’s the best trash talk we get: 
“I’d say (UF quarterback Tim Tebow) would prob-ably be about 
the fourth-
best quarter -
back in our conference,” O k l a h o m a c o r n e r b a c k 
D o m i n i q u e 
Franks said on Sunday.
F r a n k s 
added that it’s easier to pre-
pare to face Tebow than Big 12 signal callers Colt McCoy (Texas), Graham Harrell (Texas Tech) and Sam Bradford (Oklahoma) because they throw twice as many passes per game.
Those comments sent media mem-
bers into a frenzy. When reporters heard about what Franks said, they 
scrambled to find someone who had 
the quote so they could blog it or get a story done.
It sickens me to see our standards 
for quality trash talk lowered this much. 
First of all, what Franks said was 
TRUE. Tebow would be the fourth-best quarterback in the Big 12. He might be a more valuable player than 
that trio, but in offenses where the 
goal is to launch footballs all over the field to a zillion zig-zagging receivers Cleaned-up trash talk too tame for big game

UF football coachWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7, 2009  ALLIGATOR, 15
at a fast pace, Bradford, McCoy 
and Harrell are better-suited to 
succeed.
Plus, it’s not exactly an insult 
to rank Tebow below two players 
who edged him out in the Heisman voting and a third who finished a 
spot behind him.
I know there are plenty of 
things the players are dying to say 
about their opponents, but we’ll never hear it.
Desperate to avoid giving teams 
“bulletin-board material,” coaches are constantly policing their play-
ers to avoid any statements that 
could be considered out of line.
To make matters worse, this 
season the Gators have been reeled 
in tight by UF’s Sports Information 
Department, making it even harder to get quality smack from players.  
Here’s an example of how para-noid people are: After UF topped 
Arkansas this season, linebacker 
Brandon Spikes told me it was because the Razorbacks weren’t as tough or hardworking as the 
Gators.
So, the media didn’t see Spikes 
again for quite some time, report-
ers were barred from interviewing players on the field for the next 
game against LSU and I had a UF 
staffer follow me all over the field 
after the Florida-Georgia game to 
make sure I didn’t talk to Spikes.
Wow.First off, the fear over giving a 
foe an edge by spouting off to the media is ridiculous.
Coaches fabricate stories and 
trash talk all the time to motivate 
players, so whether it’s actually 
said or not doesn’t matter. 
Do you really think Tebow is 
going to play harder because of Franks’ comments? Do you think 
there’s anything anyone could say 
to make any OU or UF players try 
any harder on Thursday?
My answer is no. Trash talk 
doesn’t affect the outcome of 
games. It’s just fun, and sports are 
a little less interesting without it.the game and warm up with the team, and he still 
holds out hope for playing, although he admits his only chance might be during a kneel-down at the end of the game if UF is leading.
“This is what you come to college for — to 
compete for a national championship,” Ingram said. “Sitting out the entire season was frustrat-ing, and coming into this big-time environment with the crowd and another great team you’re playing against — it’s very highly anticipated.”
He admitted that if it were up to him, he might 
play Thursday . He said he and Meyer have joked about him possibly getting on the field.
“The only thing is, I haven’t been out there in 
pads and had the full contact yet,” he said. “That’s the only thing I might be a little timid about. As far as running, catching, cutting full-speed, I’m doing all that, and it’s coming along really well.”
But he isn’t worried about the anxiety that 
plagues many athletes recovering from knee sur -
geries. Some never regain their old form because they can’t get back the complete confidence to make cuts without thinking of the injury.
Ingram said his situation is different because 
of how he sustained the injury.
He did it without pads after being pulled 
down by his shoulders. Very different, he said, from someone who has his knee hit from differ -ent angles by defenders in full contact.
“Whenever I get back into it, I’ll just be able to 
go full-speed. I don’t have any fear about it right now,” he said. “I feel like I rehabbed and did my therapy process really well, so I feel like I’ll be ready to compete.”
When asked about how Ingram has looked in 
practice, UF assistant coach Dan Mullen couldn’t suppress a smile.
“Oh yeah. Oh yeah,” he said. “He can go.”But quickly after, he had a more somber out-
look.
“We were hoping maybe 
there’d be a shot for him in this game,” Mullen said. “For his fu-ture, with the doctors, they just determined that it’s better for him to just keep preparing and 
do some things. I watch him run routes and do things out there. He looks fabulous.”
Mullen understands Ingram’s frustration, but 
the coaches don’t want to risk any possible fur -
ther injury by rushing him back too fast.
“For him, unless the doctors say he’s 100-
percent go, we wouldn’t put his future at risk,” Mullen said. “He has a tremendous future in 
front of him. I imagine he’s going to be a top pick 
in the draft.
“That’s where his focus needs to be. He’s done 
a great job. He’s part of this team, part of this fam-ily. He has a big future to worry about.”Tight end’s NFL future No. 1 priority
