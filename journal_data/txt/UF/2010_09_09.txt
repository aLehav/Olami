Despite death threats and 
attempted bribes, the Rev. 
Terry Jones of the Dove World Outreach Center has a mes-
sage for Gainesville: The burn 
is on — for now.
Jones made the announce-
ment at an afternoon press 
conference Thursday as a 
crowd of sweaty reporters jos-tled for camera angles outside the church.
 A handful of the church’s 
pastors plan to burn about 200 copies of the Islamic holy book, the Quran, on the prop-erty at 5805 Northwest 37th St.  
on Sept. 11.
“As of right now,” he said, 
“we are not convinced that 
backing down is the right thing.”
Imam Muhammad Munri, 
president of the Islamic Soci-ety of Central Florida, spoke 
with Jones for about 20 min-
utes. Afterward, he said Jones didn’t agree to cancel the burn but said he would pray about 
it.
“The pastor was listening, 
attentive, extremely courteous 
and said he would consider it,” Munri said. “I think the 
pastor, as a Christian, will fol-
low in the footsteps of Christ and will do the right thing.”
Luke Jones, Terry Jones’ 
son and a pastor at Dove 
World Outreach Center, said 
the church has received hun-dreds of violent threats and even some offers of money 
in exchange for canceling the event. 
But for now, he said, aside 
from the use of force, the only 
way the burn will be canceled is if plans for the mosque at 
Ground Zero are halted.
Nancy Harvell, a 50-year-old 
Gainesville resident, brought her two young children to the 
property today to give them a 
chance to experience history in 
the making.
“This is history in the mak-
ing,” she said. “It’s incredible 
to me that something like this 
can happen.”

day afternoon. She brought the Rev. Terry Jones a sign because she said Jones just needed a sign in order to not burn the Quran. He plans to burn the Quran on Sept. 11. 
� RICK SCOTT ANNOUNCED 
THAT HE WILL ONLY DO TWO DEBATES.
By PAUL RUNNESTRAND
Alligator Staff Writer
A proposed gubernatorial de-
bate at UF, scheduled for Oct. 4, 
has been canceled due to schedul-ing conflicts.
“Unfortunately , the timing did 
not work out,” debate co-chairman Jon Philipson said in a press re-lease. 
Democratic candidate Alex Sink 
accepted an invitation to the debate, 
as well as four others throughout 
the state, on Aug. 30.
But Republican 
nominee Rick Scott announced Wednes-
day he would agree to 
only two debates, Oct. 20 at Nova Southeastern University in Davie and Oct. 25 at the University of 
South Florida in Tampa.
The Sink campaign is still push-
ing for five debates and wants UF 
on the schedule.
“Alex Sink wants to have five 
statewide televised debates, includ-ing kicking off the debate sched-ule at the University of Florida in early October,” said Kyra Jennings, 
Sink’s press secretary.
Jennings said Scott declining to 
debate is proof that he is ducking 
Florida voters.
“Scott would rather talk about 
national issues through 30-second negative ads than talk directly with UF students and Florida voters about Florida issues,” she said.
Representatives from Scott’s 
campaign did not respond by press time.Debate

A male body, estimated to be decaying 
for five to seven days, was found in north-
west Gainesville on Wednesday evening. 
A shotgun and a walking cane were 
found next to the body in Alfred A. Ring 
Park in an area off of the boardwalk half-
way down the trail.Authorities said at around 6:30 p.m., 
they received a call from a man who said he found the body after his wife noticed 
an unusual odor while walking through 
the park.Gainesville Police Department Sgt. 
Martin Krpan, who heads the Forensic Unit, said the body would not be removed until morning, when it is safer and visibil-ity is better.
“We want to be as thorough possible,” 
he said.
He said the body could not yet be iden-
tified, nor could the man’s age, and it will take DNA records and dental records to 
do so.
Krpan said the cause of death could 
not be determined.Police find body in Gainesville parkLOCAL NEWSDove to world: Burn will go on

“Islam is of the Heart” wristbands are offered at UF, countering the 
“Islam is of the Devil” message of the Dove World Outreach Center.
� THE BRACELETS READ    
“ISLAM IS OF THE HEART“
By MINA RADMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
While Dove World Outreach 
Center is gaining national at-
tention for its planned Quran 
burning, one UF student is qui-etly working to promote peace in Gainesville. 
Janice Dees is handing out red 
and white bracelets on Turlington Plaza to garner support for UF’s Muslim community.
The bracelets, which read “Is-
lam is of the Heart,” are intended to counter Dove World Outreach Center’s anti-Islamic messages.
“Right now the eyes of the 
world are on Gainesville,” Dees 
said. “If we can, we should show 
as much support as possible for the Muslim community.”
Dees, a 22-year-old UF English 
senior, has been motivated to take action since spring, when a con-frontation with a woman from the 
small Gainesville church left her 
outraged. 
“I said to her that ‘Jesus 
preached a message of peace, 
don’t you realize this isn’t creat-
ing peace in your community?’ and she replied, ‘I don’t want peace; I want war,’” Dees said.
When biking past church 
members one day, a frustrated Dees exclaimed, “Islam is of the 
heart!” 
She later found 
the message appro-priate for the Lives-
trong-esque bracelets. 
Her slogan is intended to coun-
ter the church’s message, “Islam 
is of the Devil.” 
The controversial message is 
displayed on a series of signs on 
the church’s property in north-
west Gainesville.
Church members have also 
printed T-shirts with the slogan 
on them. Dees spent $60 to order 200 
wristbands, hoping to provide 
students with a convenient and 
free way to refute the church.
“I feel like by passing these out, 
I’m taking away [the church’s] 
power and creating a positive 
atmosphere of love and accep-tance,” Dees said. “Muslim stu-dents shouldn’t have to step on campus or in Gainesville and feel 
like they’re an object of hatred. 
No one should feel that way.”
Dees plans to remain on Tur -
lington through Friday and has 
also collected donations. 
Half of the proceeds will go to-
ward the purchase of additional 
wristbands, and the other half will be sent to flood victims in 
Pakistan. 
She hopes her efforts will turn 
attention away from the Dove 
World Outreach Center’s actions.
“People who say such things 
shouldn’t have a strong media spotlight,” Dees said. “Religion doesn’t kill people. People do.”Bracelets counter Dove message

When Bill and Hazel Hough 
donated the self-portrait that hangs 
in the new William R. Hough Hall, they chose a modern, multidimen-sional piece from their home in As-
pen, Colo.                                      
The Houghs, who donated $30 
million, the largest private gift in 
UF history, to the graduate busi-ness programs, said the picture was one of many personal touches they wanted in the building.                                                                            
“It’s much better than a still pho-
to of me in a suit, glowering at the 
students,” Bill Hough said to about 
200 people at a Wednesday dedica-tion ceremony .                                      
Hough Hall, on Southwest 13th 
Street and Hull Road, blends with the surrounding decades-old build-ings on UF’s campus.                                        
But closer inspection reveals 
important details: state-of-the-art 
technology , ultra-modern design 
and the touch of passionate bene-factors.  The Houghs helped choose the building’s artwork, including four purple and turquoise boats that hang high over the common area and are worth $90,000. 
Bill Hough also insisted that the 
rooms be flexible enough to adjust 
to new technologies, said Sara Braz-
da, director of development for the business college.
“They’re the perfect partners on 
something like this,” Brazda said. “They’ve given their input and re-sources, and they’ve stayed com-mitted to the project from start to finish. But they also allowed room 
for the professionals to carry out 
their own visions.”                      For generations, students will ponder investments and stock prices as they walk through the business graduate building, and many students won’t give a passing thought to the donors who made the building a reality . 
But who are the people who do-
nated so much time and money to Hough Hall? And what inspired them to give?
Meet Bill and Hazel
Sitting with the Houghs in 
their sunny , modest apartment, it’s immediately easy to like them.                                                Both 
83 years old, Bill and Hazel Hough 
are not snobby or stuffy but curious 
and cordial. They talk openly about the donations they’ve made to UF’s graduate business program, athletic programs and the Harn Museum. But they aren’t bragging. 
“I learned a lot at UF, and I feel 
like it’s my duty to give back,” said Bill Hough, who earned a master of business administration.                     
Every day , he walks two blocks 
to his office from his downtown St. Petersburg apartment to work as a 
consultant at the investment com-
pany he founded and then operated for 38 years before selling it in 2004.
He loves bonds. And he loves 
his wife. So at 4:30 p.m. on a Mon-day when she doesn’t feel well, he’s anxious to leave work to take care of her. 
In the elevator on the way out 
of the building, the self-described financial conservative fumbles with a can of powdered Gatorade, and then he unwittingly reveals a secret to his financial success.                                                             
“My wife is making me take this 
back to the store,” he says with a chuckle. “It has a dent.”                                            
Hazel Hough is as warm and 
worldly as the colorful paintings and sculptures she’s fit into every nook of their apartment.                  
When her husband walks in late, 
she teasingly scolds him. He gives her a kiss. She lights up when she talks about her travels, recalling her meetings with people in countries such as Thailand and  Georgia. 
Because of her admiration for 
the arts, her husband named a wing of St. Petersburg’s Museum of Fine Arts after her, she said. The Houghs and the Gators                                 
Bill Hough attended UF from 
1947-1948 as one of two people in the first class of UF’s MBA program. He studied hard, but he also social-ized with his Kappa Sigma frater -
nity brothers.
Life at his fraternity house, 
which was on Southwest 13th Street and Second Avenue, required that he sometimes stay up late playing bridge, he said.                                                                    
“We slept about 140 men, and 
I stayed on the back porch,” he said with a laugh. “It was cold on 
that back porch.”                           On football game days, Hough and his frater -
nity brothers walked 
to the stadium. “The campus was small back then, and few people had cars or bicycles,” he said.                                                               
The Gator football team didn’t 
win a single SEC game in 1947, but 
Hough’s support for the team was 
unconditional.                           
 “It was a bad time for Florida 
football, but we still rooted for them,” he said.                                    
Hazel Hough became a Gator 
later than her husband.                                                                      
Despite graduating from Florida 
State University, she’s long consid-
ered herself a Gator, a title made of-
ficial in 2007 when the faculty senate named her an honorary alumna.                                                         
Hough found out about the honor when she was up reading the St. Petersburg Times one Sunday morning. 
“I had to read it twice,” she 
laughed. “I couldn’t wait for Bill to wake up so I could tell him.”
Bill and Hazel fall in love                              
Bill and Hazel Hough, then Ha-
zel Clarkson, met in Fort Myers. Her mother and his aunt, who were best friends, were hoping the recent col-lege graduates would hit it off. 
“Her mother wanted her to come 
to my aunt’s house for a Coke, and she had just gotten home from the beach, so she didn’t feel like it,” Bill Hough said. “But she came over any-way . We were both on our guard.” 
On their third date, Bill Hough 
picked up his future wife in his blue 1941 Dodge Coupe and took her to 
see the Harry James Band, a popular 
swing-era orchestra.                    
“I fell in love with her at that 
concert,” he said, smiling at the memory.                                                    
Bill Hough started an investment 
company in St. Petersburg, and Ha-zel Hough worked in merchandis-ing at Burdines department store in Miami.
Tired of the distance, Bill Hough 
cooked up a conservative proposal. “What would you say if I asked you to marry me?”                      She replied, “I don’t know, you’ll 
h a v e  t o  a s k  m e  fi r s t ! ”                                                                         
They married in April of 1951, 
and they have three children.                                                        
Success in business                                                 
Bill Hough started his invest-
ment business, William R. Hough and Co., three years out of gradu-ate school, something he said was possible because of what he learned 
about stocks, bonds and good in-
vestments at UF. In his early twen-ties, he had to convince clients that he could invest their money well.                                                                           
“He always looked younger than 
he was,” Hazel said. “But people saw that he was an earnest young man.”                                    
Stocks were low when he got into 
business in the early 1950s, Bill said.                                          
“There was not that much com-
petition and there were very few 
people entering the investment 
business at that time. Most invest-ments went up,” he said.                                                           
But it was his hard work that 
transformed his small invest-m e n t  c o m p a n y  i n t o  a  p o w e r h o u s e .                                                    To  i l l u s t r a t e ,  h e  t o l d  a  s t o r y.                                    
One Friday before Christmas, he 
was supposed to fly from St. Peters-
burg to Atlanta and then drive to 
Crestview, in the Florida panhan-dle, to bid on a bond issue. A bliz-zard in Atlanta rerouted his flight to Chicago. From Chicago he flew to Memphis, Tenn., where he landed at midnight. He rented a car and drove eight hours to Crestview, ar -
riving only an hour before his 9 a.m. meeting.            
“We made the only bid, so we 
got the deal,” he said. “It was worth 
the journey.”
Bill and Hazel today                                         
These days, Bill and Hazel 
Hough attend UF’s major football 
and basketball games, but health problems prevent them from mak-ing it to every home game like they 
used to.                               
Even so, they’ve been to 
Gainesville often in the past two 
years to decide on art for Hough Hall, visit their granddaughter who attends UF and go to the Harn Mu-seum.                                                        
In St. Petersburg, they’ve do-
nated to many of the museums and 
schools visible from the glass wall of 
their 10th floor apartment, including the Salvador Dali Museum, Eckerd College and St. Petersburg College. “Some people prefer the apartments that are much higher up,” Hazel said. “But me, I prefer to be a part of what’s happening down on the ground.” 4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2010

GREEK LIFE
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
After a four-year hiatus, the Alpha Eta 
chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity is re-
turning to UF.
The fraternity was suspended following an 
alcohol-related incident in 2006. The “Pikes” appealed the suspension and won the right to return to campus in 2008.  
Now, the fraternity is looking to regroup 
and revamp its tarnished image. Over the next six weeks, representatives 
from the fraternity’s international headquar -
ters will be talking with a number of UF of-
ficials and Greek community leaders seeking 
input and recommendations for recruitment.
The recruitment will be entirely recom-
mendation-based. The fraternity will not par -
ticipate in rush week.
“We’re not looking for the typical frat guy . 
We’re looking for a well-rounded individual,” said Matt Collette, one of the two men who 
will be helping rebuild the fraternity . “We’re looking for the most motivated, involved men 
at the University of Florida.” 
Those interested in joining the fraternity 
still can but will be subjected to a professional-style interview process, Collette said.
Since the fraternity currently has almost no 
senior members, it is a unique opportunity for 
men to help start the new chapter and get in

� HE HAD LAST BEEN SEEN ON THE 
MORNING OF SEPT. 2.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
A recent UF graduate who was missing 
in Rio de Janeiro was found alive in a hospi-tal Wednesday morning. 
Horica Ionescu, who graduated from 
UF in May, was last seen on the morning of  
Sept. 2  by his host family. 
Ionescu was taking classes to become 
certified to teach English as a second lan-
guage. When he missed two days of classes, 
his teacher notified the local police and the 
U.S. Embassy. 
Ionescu’s sister, Georgeta, said she and her family knew something was wrong 
when he skipped class because that was un-like him. 
She said they did not think he had been 
kidnapped because they did not receive a ransom note. 
Georgeta said her brother was not in-
jured, but he had been in a Brazilian hospital 
the entire time he was missing. She said the hospital staff had trouble determining who he was because he had no identi-
fication with him.
She said Horica is talking, but he does 
not know where he is or what happened to him. Their mother is flying to Rio de Janeiro tomorrow to be with him.
“Something happened to him,” Georgeta 
said.Missing UF alum turns

For the first time in 40 years, the fair 
won’t come to town. 
Due to unpaid debts in 2009, the 
Alachua County Fair Association was 
denied the opportunity to renew the 
lease to manage the fairgrounds by the 
Alachua County Commission.  
The nonprofit fair association also 
failed to submit a required application to the Florida Department of Agricul-ture and Consumer Services, spokes-man Terry McElroy said.  
The fair association has been dealing 
with financial problems since 2008.  
In December, the Alachua County government put the fair association on 
notice, according to Assistant County 
Manager Rick Drummond.  
“It became clear that they lost mon-
ey on last year’s fair, and some ven-
dors were not paid,” Drummond said.
In order for the 
fair association to use the fairgrounds, 
it needed a payment plan.  One of the pri-mary creditors was Gainesville Regional Utilities, who, ac-
cording to Drummond, was owed more than $30,000. The debt with Gainesville Regional Utilities was settled, but others remain outstanding. County fair canceled

Scaredy Cat
Scott drops planned UF 
debate
Ouch, Rick. Gators, we just got snubbed. 
Republican governor candidate Rick Scott announced 
Wednesday he would agree to only two debates rather 
than the five Democratic candidate Alex Sink suggested.
And the planned debate at UF is off the table thanks to 
Scott.
Scott is no stranger to snubbing his debate opponents, as he 
refused to debate Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum Aug. 
11 before the Aug. 24 primary, turning the “debate” into a one-man show for McCollum. 
Saying this is just another example of Scott trying to hide the 
truth from Florida voters,  Sink’s campaign stresses it still wants to hold five public debates within the next two months. 
And what does Scott have to hide?
Not much. Just a teensy tiny situation in which he was 
ousted as the CEO of Columbia/HCA when it committed the 
largest Medicare fraud in U.S. history, resulting in the company repaying the U.S. government a whopping total of $1.7 billion.
But that’s just chunk change for Scott, who one might say (of 
course, we would never say this), but one might say is trying to buy his ticket to the governor’s mansion through nonstop 30-second mudslinging commercials that plague our efforts to watch “Jeopardy!” in peace.
We’re glad Scott hasn’t completely snubbed Florida voters 
and his opponent by agreeing to two debates, but Gators, we have to ask ourselves an important question.
Do we really want to elect a governor who is hesitant to 
speak with us just five times? 
But, perhaps more importantly , do we really want to elect 
a governor who is hesitant to speak with us just five times and who was also the CEO of the company involved in the largest Medicare fraud in U.S. history? 
Blame Game
The blame game takes on a different meaning when the stakes sud-
denly involve more than 200 million gallons of oil, a four-
month investigation, 11 lives, 
ecological calamity and bil-lions of dollars in retribution. 
The oil behemoth BP PLC 
released a 193-page report Wednesday , a report based on its own findings of whose fin-gers are and should be point-ing at whom.
And what did the report 
find as a major cause of the oil rig’s April 20 explosion, which just so happened to become the nation’s worst environ-mental disaster? A sequence of failures. 
Really , BP? That’s the best 
you’ve got? A sequence of 
failures? Euphemizing an en-
vironmental biohazard that has resulted in irreparable harm to our waters, marine life, tourism and ability to fill up our tanks at your over -priced gas stations without feeling like a horrible person 
who is essentially burning sea 
turtles alive by stopping there as a “sequence of failures” is like labeling the attack on Pearl Harbor “a bad day .” 
And after waiting for oil 
to stop spewing into our Gulf of Mexico for four months, we realize another company 
actually owned Deepwater 
Horizon and, yes, we realize certain other companies built parts of the exploding rig that caused these “sequence of fail-ures,” but we all know who’s ultimately responsible for this “bad day.”
It’s time to step up and 
accept responsibility for the mess you’ve made, BP . The name-calling and blame game is so last year. 
As the reggae godfather 
Bob Marley said, “Before you start pointing fingers, make sure your hands are clean.”
Stick it to ‘em, Bob. Concept of justice extremely important
My fraternity, Delta Upsilon, holds justice as its 
founding and most important principle. It is my sincerest belief that this is the reason the fraternity 
has persisted since it was founded in 1834. 
As president of my fraternity, it is often my duty to convey 
the meaning of justice to potential new members of my orga-nization during rush week. Fraternity rush recently ended, and I can truly attest that conveying such a strong intangible is no easy feat.
Thus, the idea of justice is both extremely important and 
personal to me.
The concept of justice is both interpretive and intangible. 
Of life’s virtues, justice often can be one of the most difficult to describe or adhere to. Justice is an integral part of life, and I encourage others to reflect more closely on what justice means and how it can be implemented into action and abid-
ance.
A mere definition of the word justice does little justice 
to its true meaning. Justice must be experienced and felt as 
much as, if not more than, its meaning must be understood. 
My favorite definition of justice is “truth in action.” Truth 
in action is conduct designed to actively promote what is good, self-consistent and righteous. Justice is not a passive quality; it must be pursued actively and vigilantly.
This concept of justice is particularly personal. Pursuing 
a just course of action is both interpretive and never read-ily discernible. Often what is right is not what is necessarily easy or clear. One must recognize tendencies to confuse jus-tice with vengeance or self-gratification.
Justice is more than a lofty moral webbing to live by; it is 
necessary to the successful continuity of society and to pre-serve natural, unalienable rights for all humans. 
Aristotle identified greed and unlawfulness as the op-
posite of justice. Plato wrote frequently of the Athenian de-mocracy being on the verge of ruin due to excessive individualism and self-service, to which he said justice is the required remedy. Plato goes on to describe justice as a social virtue nec-essary to maintain an inherently har -
monious and good society.
As the ancient thinkers considered 
justice a necessary component of a 
functioning, good society, so must we turn to justice to ap-proach the defining issues of our time. 
In many circumstances, our country now faces tumultu-
ous and greatly influential decisions to be made. It is essential that both the citizens and the leaders of this country resort to justice when determining the path our country is to follow.
We must pursue justice at home. Our country must work 
to maintain our shared moral structure. We must strive to 
maintain the integrity of our justice system. It is one of the 
most uncorrupted and independent in the world. 
We must pursue justice abroad and recognize our respon-
sibility to correct the gravest of atrocities committed against human beings. 
We must aggressively work with international efforts 
to end the most egregious acts of human abuse and take a strong stand as a country against others, such as Iran, that knowingly allow such acts to persist.
We must pursue justice within ourselves and strive to be 
good to one another. 
In the words of Albert Einstein, “In matters of truth and 
justice, there is no difference between large and small prob-lems, for issues concerning the treatment of people are all the same.”

Letters to the Editor
Attention only fuels fanatics’ fire
Until Sept. 11, we saw terrorists as noth-
ing but extremists who had taken their violent 
turn in history. After Sept. 11, it became a pub-lic religious battle where extremists have now taken to the streets and to legislation.
This year, a mosque is fighting for its natu-
ral right to exist in New York City as many op-ponents are claiming it’s a victory lap for the Muslim community . 
This extremism has been seeping into our 
beloved town. The group, whose name I re-fuse to have in this letter based on principle, is planning a “Burn a Quran Day” as another way for the group to get the attention their 
parents probably neglected to give them. 
Now, of course, we have many religiously 
tolerant groups making petitions to stop it 
and planning rallies against it, but are we ap-proaching it the right way?
The point is that, when a child throws a fit, 
you don’t justify it by acknowledging him or her. Ignore the child and don’t give him or her attention. These people are only doing this be-cause their message is heard further by word of mouth, and not by theirs, but ours. The more 
we let them offend us, the more they win.

Inaction similar to support of Dove
As a former Gainesville resident, I’m dis-
pleased with the reaction to the Dove World 
Outreach Center’s planned “Burn a Quran Day .” Students need to use their education and make sure these people know they do not 
represent Gainesville. Not only is this a slap in the face to those 
working for understanding in this country , but 
to all residents of Gainesville who do not share the same sentiments as these people. This is exactly the type of situation that warrants a gigantic protest and perhaps huge bottles of 
water and dozens of fire extinguishers. 
This story is awful, but imagine how em-
powering it would be to show up to their burn 
fest and stop it dead in its tracks? Students need to assume their rightful place in the world as mediators of idiocy. This is happen-ing in your backyard. Students need to take back their town from these dumb hicks. The number of students definitely beats out a few 
dozen people who need to crawl back under 
the rock from which they came. If students can protest the UF police for using a Taser, they can certainly protest a group of dummies who will bring physical harm to themselves and our countrymen serving overseas. 
Let’s demonstrate to the world that there 
are still some people in this country who give a crap about free exercise of religion, not just using purchasing power to shut down their 
couch-selling business they have going on the 
side. The U.S. won’t regain its reputation for standing up for religious and social freedoms in the world unless the world can see that this is only a small part of what makes us whole. 
Inaction is the same as participating in this 
atrocity. Just going about your day and not making a stand against ignorance is a waste of time and money . What good is an education if 
you keep it to yourself?

   Seldom does the Devil do interviews. 
When she does, you better bet that she’s got a damned good reason — 
and that she’ll be dripping in designer. Ear-lier this month, Vogue magazine’s editor Anna Wintour was seen in a rare interview on NBC’s “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” 
For September is when she thrives. This 
month’s famed September issue of Vogue is bound with 532 astounding pages of fash-ion. Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week kicks off today. Yet Wintour was seated on Fallon’s 
scarlet couch cushions to, instead, promote 
the largest fashion party in history — and ev-eryone is invited.
  Friday marks the second annual Fashion’s 
Night Out, an event that stores across the world — including our very own Gainesville — will be participating in by keeping their doors open until 11 p.m.
  “We started it about 18 months ago when 
everybody was re- ally in retail dol-drums,” Wintour told Fallon. “The idea was 
just to, really, have the world inspired by 
fashion again and understand how much fun it was and get them back into the stores.”
  The spirit of Fashion’s Night Out is sweep-
ing stores across the world, from the hang-ers of the United States to the shelves of the United Kingdom to the dressing rooms of Greece. Not surprisingly, Alachua County 
is not an official participant for this year’s Fashion’s Night Out — it’s holding one of its 
own.
  The second annual Gainesville’s Fash-
ion’s Night Out: A Local Celebration of Fash-ion, will take place Friday from 6 p.m. to 10 
p.m. 
Yet, while the global Fashion’s Night Out 
includes specialty stores, department stores 
and boutiques alike, Gainesville’s take is 
more focused to give attention to locally 
owned businesses — a realm that has taken a huge blow in respect to the recession.
  “Fashion is disposable,” said Matthew 
Turner, organizer of Gainesville’s Fashion’s 
Night Out and Wolfgang owner. “It’s not nec-
essary the way that eating is or maintaining your car is. Fashion is lower on the totem 
pole. The fashion industry has definitely suf-
fered.”
  Shoppers instead have been 
opting to strap their cash for in-
expensive duds at specialty 
stores in malls, where cloth-
ing is cheap, plentiful and 
there’s no guarantee 
that you won’t see 
your outfit on 30 oth-
ers around campus.
  “There’s defi-
nitely a difference in shopping in a [lo-
cal] boutique than 
there is shopping in 
[a specialty store],” Turner said. “There’s 
something a little more unique about shopping at a [bou-
tique]. 
“Customers get 
more special attention 
and unique items. 
We remember your 
name and hook you 
up with deals when-
ever we can. It’s 
about shopping 
locally and keep-
ing your money 
in the city.”
  And while 
G a i n e s v i l l e ’ s 
Fashion’s Night 
Out isn’t neces-
sarily the real 
deal, Turner is 
making sure the event stays true to its roots. 
The original event was 
birthed in New York City last year, with a slew of celebrities making appearances in stores throughout the Big Apple to cel-ebrate the fashion industry in the midst of an economic down-turn. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen 
tended bar at Bergdorf Good-man, Gwen Stefani appeared 
at Bloomingdales and Justin Timberlake appeared at Saks Fifth Avenue — 
and that’s just 
skimming the surface.
  But don’t 
be mistaken. This is an event of so-phistication and need not 
be confused 
for something like Black Friday. 
Mothers will not 
be trampling over one another in efforts of snagging a Tickle Me Elmo. 
Wintour makes it very clear that this is 
not a humongous “sale” event. Rather, Fash-
ion’s Night Out is a celebration of fashion 
with featured specialties at each store, such as cocktails, live music or store raffles for designer goodies.
  On this side of town, each location will 
have offers similar to the global event, with 
cocktails, freebies, raffles and — shh…don’t 
tell Wintour — sales and discounts. 
Keeping it focal on the local, Gaines-
ville’s Fashion’s Night Out will be held not 
only amongst boutiques, but locally owned 
salons, clubs and bars as well. 
  “It’s a good opportunity to stimulate 
businesses across the board,” Turner said. “Salons you’ve never been to, clubs you’ve 
never been to. It’s a way to give cool busi-
nesses around the area a boost.”
  Gainesville’s Fashion’s Night Out also 
makes a game out of the event. 
Participants will purchase a “FNO” card 
for $5, which will serve as a pass to exclu-sive deals and goodies to be punched at all participating businesses. 
The first shopper to return to Wolfgang — 
the home base for the evening — with their 
card fully punched will receive a grand prize 
of gifts from all participating Fashion’s Night Out boutiques (last year’s included T-shirts, purses, gift cards and salon products).
The next 10 shoppers to finish their card 
will also receive goodie bags filled with treats from the boutiques as well.
  It’s a race to the fashion finish, so you 
better be able to run in your heels. thursday, september 9, 2010   ALLIGATOR, 9

1. Purchase a $5 FNO Card at Wolfgang, starting at 6 p.m.
2. Join the Facebook group: “2nd Annual Gainesville’s Fashion’s Night Out!!” for updates.
3. Dress to impress: The key word in the event title is “fashion,” so plan accordingly if you’re heading out straight from class.
4. And on that note, wear comfy shoes — unless you don’t mind running in heels.

 I wish I had my roomie’s girl
 Dear Jared,
 My roommate’s girlfriend is really hot. Like 
really hot. Lately, she’s been kind of throwing 
me some hints that she thinks I’m kind of hot too 
(we’re talking eye contact, intense ﬂ  irting, striking 
up random convos on Facebook chat). I obviously 
wouldn’t want to piss off my roommate, or ruin our friendship, but am I a horrible person for pursuing his girl? Does she sound for real?
  -Hot for Roommate’s Girl    Whoa, random Facebook chat and eye contact? 
Maybe soon, if you play your girlfriend-stealing cards right, she’ll “like” your keg stand default picture, you 
big Casanova, you!
  And, to answer your other question, yes, you are a 
horrible person and probably a worse friend. 
  I certainly wouldn’t want to be in that all-too-fa-
miliar hypothetical situation where we somehow ﬁ  nd 
ourselves on a deserted island in the middle of the Paciﬁ  c, and you’re given the choice between gnawing my arm off or calling for help. Clearly, as a hypotheti-cal roommate, and fellow castaway, I’d come out look-
ing real funny in a one-sleeved T-shirt. 
  Nonverbal and, as in your case, ambiguous digital 
cues mean different things to different people. Per-
haps your roommate’s girlfriend really is just inter-ested in your social media musings or your afﬁ  nity for bonsai gardening. 
  Or, then again, perhaps she really does want to 
rummage through your artfully manscaped front lawn. There’s a ﬁ  ne line between ﬂ  irting and seducing, and 
sometimes the line involves nothing more than a good (gardening) hoe. 
  But, you’ve put yourself in 
a sticky situation in more ways 
than one.
  First, how long is your 
apartment lease? Because if it turns out your roommate’s girlfriend actually wants to sample the ﬂ  avorings of your entire apartment, rather than sticking to her own entrée, din-
ner time at your apartment might get a bit awkward when no one passes the potatoes to you.
  Then again, if you decide to step up your A-game 
and move past bonsai gardening into unknown territo-ry, you might ﬁ  nd yourself soliciting a woman who has no interest in you pulling out the old wheelbarrow. 
  But in reality, we’ve all found ourselves in the ta-
boo world of the apple in Eve’s Garden where we lust for that luscious Red Delicious. 
  It’s a difﬁ  cult position, and no, you aren’t actually a 
horrible person. We’ve all been there, and it’s natural to want to do what they do on the Discovery Channel 
with your roommate’s girlfriend. Because she’s some-
thing you can’t have.
  Then again, time changes people. Cravings 
change. Flavors mix. 
  And you ain’t nothing but mammals, right? Keep 
playing your cards right.

 Resident Evil: 
Afterlife (in 3-D)
 Seems like everything’s in 3-D 
these days, including the video game adapta-
tion of “Resident Evil: Afterlife,” which hits theaters Friday. The ﬁ  lm’s heroine, Alice (Milla Jovovich), continues her quest to save 
the suffering innocent, but this time they seek 
refuge in Los Angeles. Expect to be knocked dead (no pun intended) by the special effects — we’re talking about 3-D zombies, after all. Monster  
 “Monster” sure is a 
monster of a song, including not 
only some of rap’s most familiar faces but also indie folk band Bon Iver. But 
some things never change: On the 
track, West stays true to his self-lauding swagger, rapping, “Everybody knows I’m a mother[expletive] monster.” The track is one of ﬁ  ve due out on “Watch the Throne,” a Jay-Z/Kanye West col-laboration EP that doesn’t yet have a release date. Dancing Dog
 
This furry friend would 
deﬁ  nitely land a spot on “Danc-
ing with the Dogs” — if that were a real show. Try not to smile when you watch this golden 
retriever in a sparkly green skirt hop and twirl 
around on its hind legs, doing the meringue. Sure, videos of dancing dogs on YouTube aren’t exactly hard to ﬁ  nd, but what makes this one so impressive is the canine’s stamina and apparent joy for doing the Haitian-Creole dance. We admit it: This pup could totally out-do us on the dance ﬂ  oor. 2010 MTV Video 
Music Awards
  It’s music’s big night, and viewers 
can expect a whole new brand of shenanigans 
at this year’s award show because comedienne Chel-sea Handler is the host. Enough said. Lady Gaga leads in nominations with 13, although the pop 
queen won’t be taking the stage again with another 
gory interpretation of one of her hit anthems. Not to worry, though: MTV’s got a wealthy lineup of stars to ﬁ  ll that void, including Justin Bieber, Usher, Paramore and Kanye West, whose unforgettable interruption of Taylor Swift’s speech last year will likely be mocked at this year’s presentation.

   Our favorite web click-ables to get you through classcritic’s corner
  By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
avenue writer
  At least once during your educational career at 
UF, you’ve had one or will have one of those dread-
ed three-hour classes. Being trapped in those 
walls for longer than 50 minutes can put the mind into a zoned-out coma.    Luckily for you, there are some awesomely dis-
tracting websites to get you through. Here’s a few: 
Stumbleupon.comThis site is the daddy of all time wasters. You 
tell it your interests, and it ﬁ  nds cool stuff from ev-erywhere. Warning: You may not be able to stop stumbling once you start.Gainesvillemugs.com For the voyeur in all of us. This site shows mug-
shots of everyone arrested in Alachua County in the past month or so AND the crimes they com-mitted. You may even have friends on the site right now and not even know it. What are you waiting for? Supermariobroscrossover.com 
Have you ever wanted to play the original Su-
per Mario Bros. game with Mega Man, Simon from 
Castlevania or Ryu from Shinobi? Super Mario Bros. crossover is the original 8-bit game, but you 
can use other characters from the Nintendo era.

Sports for all Gators sports.Steven H. Keys / Alligator Staff
UF’s Justin Trattou, along with the rest of the team’s defensive linemen, will need to stay in their gaps against USF quarterback B.J. Daniels on Saturday. 
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@allgator.org
 
Gators defensive line coach 
Dan McCarney was proud of 
his front four after the group held Miami (Ohio) to four rush-
ing yards last Saturday. But 
he knows the Florida defense faces a much tougher ground 
attack this week against South 
Florida.
The Gators will face a dual-
threat quarterback in B.J. Dan-iels, who led the Bulls with 772 yards and nine touchdowns 
on the ground last season.
Coaches have told their 
players to keep an eye on Dan-iels throughout every play 
this week, and the line will be charged with keeping him in 
the pocket.
 “B.J. Daniels is a great play-
er,” linebacker Jelani Jenkins said. “We’ll definitely have 
our hands full. We’re watching him on tape, trying to figure 
out ways we can stop him.”
McCarney, who coached 
at USF when Daniels signed, compared him to former Iowa 
State quarterback Seneca Wal-lace, who played for McCar -
ney from 2001-2002. 
“(Daniels) can turn a bad 
play into a good one, a good 
one into a great one, a no-play 
into a heck of a play,” McCar -
ney said. “If you’re just going 
to tee-off and just collapse the 
pocket and run up the field, he’ll pull it up and run.”Offense opening up: Af-
ter managing just 25 yards 
through the first three quar -
ters last weekend, the Gators 
gained 187 yards and scored 
two touchdowns in the fourth 
quarter. The team made a conscious effort at halftime to 
open up the offense, coach Ur -
ban Meyer said. 
Four of quarterback John 
Brantley’s first five passes to 
start the game were thrown near the line of scrimmage, 
which he said was part of the 
team’s game plan.
Meyer blamed the team’s 
conservative play calling on the now-infamous 13 botched snaps.  
“When you get out of 
rhythm as many times as we did 
in the first half, 
it’s tough,” he said.
The Gators 
will be more 
explosive if their quarterback-
center exchange becomes con-
sistent, Meyer said.
D-Line Rotation: Defensive 
coordinator Teryl Austin said the Gators played defensive linemen Jaye Howard and Jus-
tin Trattou too much last week. 
He said the team needs to keep its biggest players fresh and 
give inexperienced players a 
chance to improve.
“We’ve got to try to get 
some rotation, especially when it’s as hot as it is,” Austin said. “They’re taking on double teams and getting cut every 
play, so it’s really important to 
develop some depth.”
Receivers blocking: Omar -
ius Hines said the team has yet to find a receiver who blocks as well as Riley Cooper, who 
exhausted his eligibility last 
fall. 
Meyer criticized his re-
ceivers last weekend for poor blocking, and the group has focused on that area all week 
in practice, including a long 
session Tuesday, Hines said. 
“We got to be able to block 
on the perimeter in order for us to be successful and have big plays,” he said.
Injuries, Suspensions: Left 
tackle Xavier Nixon (knee) has practiced with the team this 
week and he could be back 
in the lineup Saturday, Meyer said. 
He also expects defensive 
tackle Terron Sanders (knee) and guard Carl Johnson (sus-
pension) to be available to play 
Saturday. 
Left tackle Matt Patchan 
(wrist), however, is still in a long cast and will miss “a few weeks.”
iTebow: Former quarter -
back Tim Tebow went viral Wednesday, launching an of-
ficial Twitter account, a Face-
book page and his own web-site, www.timtebow.com. 
These moves were handled 
by his company, XV Enterpris-es, to increase Tebow’s market-
ability.Gators defense focuses on containing QB Daniels
You’ve got space cleared on your floor 
for a blow-up mattress, maybe even a neatly folded towel ready if you take 
pride in being a host.
The plan goes like this: show your Tampa 
buddies some fun on Friday, putting up with their chatter about the Rays, how USF is a bud-
ding college football superpower and how, 
“Dude, you seriously have to come check out Mons Venus. You can touch them!”
You let them talk all they want because, 
in your mind, you’re just giving them rope 
to hang themselves after your Gators make 
mincemeat out of their Bulls on Saturday.
This has been your idea ever since the 
game came onto the schedule. USF fans want 
to act big and bad? OK, Florida will provide the wake-up call.
For students — especially those with 
friends in Tampa — it’s a big deal.
For players? Well, listen to this slip of the 
tongue from UF cornerback Janoris Jenkins on 
Wednesday.
“We’re looking forward to UCF.”
Ouch.
Jenkins didn’t mean it as a slight; it just 
slipped out. And for what it’s worth, he said “Of course” when asked if the Bulls’ program belongs among UF, Miami and FSU as the 
state’s elite.
But Jenkins would never accidentally call 
the Seminoles or Hurricanes by the wrong 
name, and that shows how much of a “rival-
ry” this truly is.UF coaches and 
players have had noth-
ing but positive com-
ments about USF this 
week, raving about quarterback B.J. Dan-iels and how far the 
program has come in 
the past few years.
But there’s no un-
derlying fear or disdain 
in those statements. 
It sounds like they’re proudly talking about 
their little brother, and the sibling down I-75 hasn’t come out with much trash talk either.
A Lane Kiffin-esque leader would kick 
start a rivalry, but USF coach Skip Holtz and UF’s Urban Meyer are far from that. 
Holtz helped land Meyer his first job at 
Notre Dame, and they’ve gushed about each 
other in interviews.
And really, who wouldn’t love Skip? Holtz 
and I have a strained relationship since he 
bailed on my beloved East Carolina Pirates, 
but deep down, he’s a hero of mine because 
he wins and seems like a genuinely good guy while doing it.
But Holtz isn’t driving up to Gainesville to 
smile at his ol’ pal Urban and take a whoop-
ing.
He knows this role, and he plays it well.
At ECU, another program with a Scrappy-Game not a rivalry for UF, but USF has a chance to make it oneFootball

for selling a jersey for $1,000 to some-one who qualifies as an agent.
Green sold his jersey from last sea-
son’s Independence Bowl. The junior, who sat out the season opener against Louisiana-Lafayette, must miss three more games before regaining his eli-gibility, according to the ruling from 
the NCAA.
No. 22 Georgia plays at No. 24 
South Carolina on Saturday.
The ruling comes after much spec-
ulation that Green was involved in the 
NCAA’s probe into improper benefits given by agents to athletes at several schools, including North Carolina.
Part of the probe was a party at 
Miami Beach. Green insisted he didn’t attend the party, but Wednesday’s an-nouncement showed the NCAA was looking at other benefits received by 
the player.
Georgia says Green has repaid the 
$1,000 to a charity.
Green issued an apology to Geor -
gia coaches, his teammates and fans “for the mistake in judgment” in a 
statement released by the school.“I very much regret all that has tak-
en place and the distraction that’s been caused,” Green said. “I’ve learned a 
valuable lesson and hope others can 
learn from my mistake. I can only fo-cus my attention now on practicing and looking ahead to getting back 
with my teammates as quickly as pos-
sible.”
The 6-foot-4 Green is rated as one 
of the top receivers in the nation. He is projected as a possible top-five pick in 
the 2011 NFL draft.
Green recorded 53 catches for 808 
yards and six touchdowns in 2009 de-
spite missing all or part of five games 
due to injuries.
The loss of Green is a blow to Geor -
gia’s hopes in the Southeastern Con-
ference’s Eastern Division before the crucial game at South Carolina.
“Certainly I’m disappointed with 
the outcome,” coach Mark Richt said. “However, we have games to play and that’s where our focus needs to be 
in the coming days and weeks. Other 
players will have to step forward and I’m confident they will do that.”

Georgia wide receiver A.J. Green sold his game-worn 
jersey from last season’s Independence Bowl. 
Doo attitude, he was always 
trying to get his school on the map.
Like the Bulls, Pirates fans 
have long considered them-
selves on par with the best 
teams in their state, and they’ve 
largely been ignored because those other teams’ fans have bigger fish to fry.
Holtz thrived in that posi-
tion, taking down West Vir -
ginia and Virginia Tech to open the 2008 season, then winning back-to-back Conference USA 
titles.
He’s in the same spot at 
USF, where the Bulls are trying 
to earn everyone’s respect.
They don’t have it yet, but 
things could change in the course of a few hours in The Swamp. 
Conquering Florida would 
give the Bulls road wins against the Gators and ’Noles in two years, and that’s the only way to make this a real rivalry.
If that happens, you can bet 
UF players would remember 
the school’s name.MIKE , from page 17NCAA FOOTBALLGreen suspended for next three gamesRecR uiting

Mike Blakely doesn’t know yet where he 
wants to play next season, but the Braden-
ton Manatee High running back has an idea 
of how coaches would like to utilize him at 
the college level.
“Basically all the schools I’ve talked 
to have talked to me about the wildcat,” 
Blakely said after his team’s preseason 48-
10 dismantling of Tampa Plant High on 
Aug. 27.
In a rematch of last season’s Class 5A 
State Championship, Blakely showed why 
college coaches have approached him about 
taking snaps in the wildcat formation.
The four-star running back, according 
to Rivals.com, rushed for 156 yards on five 
carries and scored four touchdowns against Plant’s defense, which is anchored by five-star FSU oral commit James Wilder Jr.
And while many eyes were on Wilder, 
the No. 3 recruit in the nation, it was Blake-
ly who drew attention in the preseason 
matchup.
Of his four touchdowns, three came on 
the ground, including a six-yard scamper that displayed his ability to beat the de-
fense around the edge.
Blakely’s fourth score came through the 
air on a play that looked familiar to any-
one who watched the Gators during the 
Tim Tebow era. Blakely took a direct snap 
and tossed a two-yard jump pass over the 
defense.His most notable highlight, though, 
came on a 90-yard run in which he gashed Plant’s defense and overcame a facemask grab by Wilder before sprinting to the end zone.
“He’s multitalented,” Manatee coach Joe Kinnan said. “He can run. He can throw. 
He’s got speed. He’s got power. He’s got 
moves and he can catch.”
Blakely again displayed his versatil-
ity Saturday when Manatee traveled to 
Pennsylvania for its season opener against Woodland Hills (Pa.) High. He rushed for 
86 yards and gained 30 receiving yards.
He also scored a 13-yard touchdown off 
a direct snap from the shotgun formation.
Kinnan compared Blakely to former 
Manatee greats Shevin Wiggins and Ty-rone Williams, who both went to Nebraska. 
Wiggins was Florida’s Mr. Football in 1993 before playing wingback in college, and Williams was an NFL cornerback for nine 
seasons. 
At 5-foot-9, 195 pounds, Blakely is bigger 
than those two were in high school, Kinnan 
said. But he is just as versatile and fast as they were, running a 4.4 40-yard dash.
“Since the ninth grade, [Blakely] has 
been our backup quarterback, too,” Kinnan said. “He’s good enough to win with, but that’s not his position in college.”
Unlike Wiggins and Williams, though, 
Blakely doesn’t have Nebraska on his ra-dar. Florida, Auburn and South Carolina are his leading choices and he plans to visit 
all three schools this season. He has already 
set up a visit to Auburn when it hosts South 
Carolina on Sept. 25.
While most coaches have talked to 
Blakely about running the wildcat, he said 
Florida has discussed using him as its slot 
receiver, also known as the “Percy Posi-
tion.”
“They see me as a very versatile person 
because I can throw the ball, I can run the 
ball, I can catch the ball, return, anything,” 
Blakely said after the Plant game. “That’s 
like what Percy Harvin did there — he just 
had a little more speed than me.”Prized Florida recruit plays multiple skill positions THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 19

It really isn’t surprising when a 
team’s starting outside hitters are 
two of its top-three kill producers. In fact, it’s expected. 
But when those same two play-
ers also rank in the top three in aces, digs and service receptions, 
it can be a shocking indicator of 
just how great a role they play in the squad’s success. 
For No. 4 Florida, those play-
ers are Kristy Jaeckel and Callie Rivers, who have played major 
parts in each of UF’s five opening 
wins. 
“(Rivers and Jaeckel) do so 
much more for us besides just at-tacking,” coach Mary Wise said. “They anchor the serve receive, 
they are a big part of our blocking 
scheme, they play back-row de-fense ... we ask so much of those 
two.”
Outside hitters are invariably 
called upon to carry the brunt of a team’s offensive load, and Rivers 
and Jaeckel are no different. 
To this point in the young sea-
son, the duo ranks first and sec-ond on the team in total attacks, with Jaeckel leading at 129 and 
Rivers checking in right behind 
at 111. 
But even when attacks and kills aren’t coming with their 
normal consistency, Jaeckel and 
Rivers have proven they are still valuable assets.  
In Saturday’s match against 
Colorado State, the outside hitters combined for a .001 hitting per -
centage but teamed up for 27 digs and 2.5 blocks. 
“When the hitting is not there, 
we’re still going to do everything that we can to contribute to the team’s success,” Jaeckel said. 
“We’re going to have off match-
es and we know that, and even though it’s not ideal, it’s going to 
happen. The encouraging thing 
is how well our team still played even with us not playing our “A” 
game.”
Despite enduring a poor of-
fensive performance, the pair of 
upperclassmen have yet to disap-
point defensively. 
Rivers and Jaeckel currently 
rank in the team’s top three in both service receptions and digs, 
trailing only libero Erin Fleming 
in each category. The outside hitters are typi-
cally targeted by the other team’s 
servers, as the tall attackers are expected to struggle defensively. 
“You have to know every single 
match that every [ball] is going to come after you,” Jaeckel said. 
“You just have to embrace it.”
And embrace it they have, as 
Rivers (.961) and Jaeckel (.951) check in just behind Fleming 
(.966) in reception percentage. 
Rivers and Jaeckel have also 
performed admirably on the op-posite side of the service equa-tion. Rivers leads the team with 
nine aces, and Jaeckel currently 
ranks third with five. 
Those figures are just one prod-
uct of the Gators’ aggressive serv-ing scheme, which is designed to pick up uncontested points and 
keep the opposition’s offense in 
check. 
“Serving aggressively is a huge 
asset of ours,” Rivers said. “Espe-cially against really big and pow-erful teams. You have to serve 
hard or else they’re going to have 
four attack options and be really hard to defend.”
Because a strong service game 
can keep an offense from estab-lishing a flow and getting into 
rhythm, Florida knows sharp 
serves will be more important than ever this Friday, when it 
takes on No. 1 Penn State. “Serving hard against anyone 
is going to help,” Rivers said, “but 
of course serving hard against a team that has three All-American 
hitters in the front row is going to 
be a huge key for us.”20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2010
