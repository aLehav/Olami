When the “Catching Fire” horses trotted  
their way into the Capitol pulling the car-
riage holding Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, most residents and students were unaware of just how close to home 
these horses galloped.
The two horses, named Tristan and 
Dieuwe, reside in Lady Lake, Fla., a town a little less than 70 miles away from 
Gainesville, at the Grand Oaks Resort and Museum in southern Marion County.Susan Kelly, director of marketing and 
special events for Grand Oaks, said the two were among about 17 other horses picked 
to star in the movie and were recruited 
about two years ago.
Tristan and Dieuwe won over the direc-
tors with their showmanship and ﬂ  air, Kel-ly said, and were given the privilege to pull the carriage for Lawrence and Hutcherson.

� FACULTY WILL BE CUT TO SIX. 
JENSEN WERLEY
Alligator Staff Writer jwerley@alligator.org
In the midst of reports that the economics 
department has stopped accepting students to 
its Ph.D. program, some people are concerned UF might not be able to sustain its undergrad-uate economics degree.
John Kraft, dean of the Warrington College 
of Business Administration — which houses the economics department — said he has long-term plans to cut the economics faculty from its current 11 tenure-track professors to six.
He said based on current resources, six 
professors would be enough to teach under-graduate courses while still staying ﬁ  scally responsible. He said currently, the economics 
department is in the largest deﬁ  cit position 
compared to the rest of the college, and every department is shrinking.
“To me, the greatest tragedy is for students 
who arrive here, and we don’t offer much in the way of undergraduate courses,” said retired UF economics professor David Den-slow.
Twice, the department was offered a move 
from the business college to the College of Lib-eral Arts and Sciences, and both times faculty voted against it, despite Kraft’s offer to sup-port the transition for three years.
“They made a choice,” Kraft said. “Maybe 
they didn’t like the choices they have, but it was all that was available.”Changes in

“OK” vs. “OK.”
Punctuation is making a blunt 
comeback in the texting world. Pe-riod.
An American University study on the texting habits of American college students has resurfaced on social media after a recent article by The New Republic. The study found that 39 percent of students’ sampled sent text messages that used punc-tuation at the end of each sentence.
Because the period is used less often, many students view its usage as intentional. It is left to the recipi-ent to decide why the punctuation was added.
“If you add punctuation when you don’t usually, that’s extra,” said UF linguistics professor Galia Hatav.
Hatav agreed that punctuation 
can be used to convey tone or add extra information when texting but 
noted that context is important.
“When you add the period, it re-
ally does mean something,” Hatav 
said. 
Gianna Gamache, a 19-year-old UF recreation, parks and tourism sophomore, said she thinks students overanalyze punctuation when tex-ting.
“If you’re arguing with someone, 
(using a period) deﬁ  nitely means 
something,” Gamache said. “But 
if you’re just talking to someone and you end with a period, to me it would just seem like you’re just us-ing good grammar.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — The prosecutor investi-
gating sexual assault allegations against Florida 
State quarterback Jameis Winston wants the process to be “thorough” and won’t let football dictate when he will wrap up his inquiry.
State Attorney Willie Meggs on Monday re-
iterated he won’t let FSU’s football schedule or Winston’s Heisman Trophy possibilities deter-mine when his investigation will be completed.
Winston has led the Seminoles to the No. 1 
ranking and they will play for a conference title Saturday, with a shot at the national crown. The deadline for Heisman ballots to be turned in is Dec. 9.
Timothy Jansen, Winston’s attorney, said 
he is communicating daily with his client, who “wants it to be over.” Jansen last week publicly complained about the pace of the investigation.
“Obviously he’s focusing on football and ac-
ademics and he knows it’s a process and we’re waiting for Mr. Meggs to conclude his investi-gation,” Jansen said.
While the allegations were initially reported to Tallahassee police nearly a year ago, the case wasn’t turned over to prosecutors until No-vember. The Tallahassee Police Department has defended its handling of the case even though 
the family of the victim has said that police de-
tectives warned them about pressing charges.
Meggs initially estimated 
it would only take a few 
weeks for prosecutors to de-termine whether to charge Winston. 
ESPN reported last month 
that DNA that matched Win-
ston was found in the under-
wear of the accuser. While Jansen has suggested that the 
sex was consensual, the family of the accuser is-sued a statement alleging that Winston raped the woman.
Meggs declined to say exactly when his in-
vestigation will be ﬁ  nished.
“We’re not basing what we are doing on a 
football schedule or anyone else’s calendar,” Meggs said. “We’re moving as rapidly as we can.”Prosecutor: Jameis Winston

As cooler temperatures set in, 
Gainesville residents are helping the 
homeless combat the weather to stay comfortable and healthy.
Pat Fitzpatrick, a homeless advo-
cate, is giving away emergency blan-kets.
“It’s going to get cold tonight,” Fitz-
patrick said Sunday as he stood on Bo Diddley Community Plaza. “So it’s not going to be a comfortable evening.”
The shiny silver Mylar blanket re-
tains up to 90 percent of a user’s body heat. He said being exposed to the ele-
ments is one problem inherent to be-
ing homeless.
“Homelessness is not a very com-plicated thing,” Fitzpatrick said. “You and I live here, and we ... have a place where we can go with good heat, but those folks out in the woods don’t.”
Rosalie Sherman, a recipient, said 
she has been homeless for about two years. She ﬁ  nds stuffed animals in dumpsters to hang along her tree-side tent located in “Tent City,” an encamp-ment south of the Guerry-Hawthorne Connection Trail. 
“I put my animals up because here 
you gotta be creative,” Sherman said. 
“You can’t hang family pictures up, so 
these are why my animals are up.”
Sherman said how good her day is 
depends on what the weather is like.
“You got your good days, and you 
got your bad days out here,” Sherman said.
Fitzpatrick said he will be giving 
out blankets to help people like Sher-
man until the supply runs out.Resident helps ward off

caught the director’s eye,” she said. “And that’s 
when they said ‘These are the two horses we need to use for Katniss and Peeta.’”
Kelly said the horses, who stand at about 6 feet 
tall, have no film training but were bred to pull 
carriages and compete in dressage, giving them an 
edge over other horse breeds.
“They have a beautiful gait, and that’s what the 
filmmakers were looking for,” she said. “It was ex-citing to see them in the movie. Everyone here has seen it, and we’re like, ‘Oh my God, those are our boys!’”
Kelly said even though they stay in the show 
barn from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily to meet visitors, they still pull their weight at the resort.
“All of our horses have a job. They’re not just 
here to eat grass,” she said. “They give carriage rides, especially for those who use us as wedding sites. Many brides have gotten the opportunity to be pulled by two movie stars.”
Samantha Troast, a 20-year-old UF English ju-
nior, said because the horses were local, the film holds special meaning.
“Just to learn they were in the movie, it kind 
of shows you the different places that went into making this movie,” she said. “It’s more than just Hollywood. It’s places across the country that have important aspects.”
Kristen O’Brien, a 21-year-old UF English se-
nior who has already seen the movie three times, said she is happy they included horses from a local area in the film.
“I like that they take horses from somewhere 
local, a farm or a breeder close by,” she said. “It’s not like they’re specifically trained for the films, so that’s nice.”
O’Brien said if she had enough free time, she 
would make the trip to Lady Lake to visit the hors-es.
“They’re really pretty horses. They’re like Black 
Beauty,” she said. “I’d like to get a picture.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2013

Twenty feet up in the air, gracefully 
twisting her body and wrapping piec-
es of silk around her feet and hands, 
A’shayla Passaretti flips upside down and dangles above the studio floor.
“It’s kind of like a flying sensation,” 
said the second-year UF public rela-tions graduate student.
Passaretti, 23, is an aerial dancer and 
co-president of Volaticus Aerial Dance club. Starting at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Volaticus Aerial Dance will have its Fall showcase in the Nadine McGuire Dance Pavillion, 
Room 11.
Aerial dance incorporates acrobatics, 
classical dance and equipment that is 
hung from the ceiling, said Calli Brock-ett, a 21-year-old UF history senior.
The showcase will feature 11 indi-
vidual performances and two group pieces. Donations are welcome, but the event is free and open to the public.
Performances will showcase the 
aerial silk, a long fabric that hangs from the ceiling; lyra, a dangling hoop; static trapeze, which stays in one spot; and corde de lisse, which is a hanging rope 
similar to the silk.
Passaretti was barely able to touch 
her toes when she joined the club four 
years ago.
“We have all skill levels,” she said. 
“People come in, and we will teach them from the ground up.”
Co-president Brockett started aerial 
dance when she joined the club her 
freshman year.
Between group practices and her in-
dividual time, Passaretti spends more 
than ten hours a week practicing.
Performing to “Demons” by Imagine 
Dragons, Passaretti has been perfecting her routine for a month and a half.
“It’s funny because I’m actually ter-
rified of heights,” she said.Aerial dancing club to hold

As 2013 comes to a close, consumer 
confidence is on the rebound.
A monthly survey conducted by UF’s 
Bureau of Economic and Business Re-
search found that consumer confidence in the economy increased in November after a dip in October.
A phone survey of 405 Floridians 
statewide included five questions rang-ing from current conditions to future ex-pectations about the economy. 
Each response is given a value from 
2 to 150, with the higher score meaning more optimism.
November’s readings resulted in an 
average of 76 as opposed to October’s 70, 
the year’s lowest reading.
Bureau Director Christopher McCarty 
said the increase is mostly a bounceback from the government shutdown and 
avoided debt ceiling default.
“When consumer confidence is low it 
means consumers, for a variety of rea-sons, are not feeling very optimistic,” he said.
McCarty predicted that December 
will probably be about the same because there is no current political happening affecting consumer confidence.
However, he said there is a strong pos-
sibility of consumer confidence declining 
in January as Congress revisits the debt 
ceiling issue.
“You can anticipate that come the new 
year the headlines will be full about what 
Congress should do about the debt ceil-
ing,” McCarty said.
Christina Ford, a 21-year-old UF polit-
ical science and economics junior, attrib-uted the increased consumer confidence 
to 44 months of private sector job growth 
under President Barack Obama.
“It’s not surprising that consumers 
are beginning to become more confident 
in the economy with numbers like that,” 
Ford said.Consumer confidence is rising 
It could impact UF’s climb to top 10 
Roger Blair, chairman of the eco-
nomics department, said moving to 
CLAS isn’t the solution.
“Why would anyone suppose 
we’ll be better in arts and sciences?” 
he asked.
He said CLAS is not better off 
and doesn’t have money to fund 
Ph.D. programs.
“People who want to blame 
us for the situation would like to suggest money would fix things,” Blair said. “It’s not going to fix any-thing.”
But some suggest the faculty 
didn’t take the offer for personal reasons.“The twist at the end is they were 
given the opportunity to leave and they didn’t. It boiled down to their own pocketbooks,” said Dave Wil-liams, a UF economics alumnus.
A contributing factor to the fi-
nancial issues facing the department is the switch to the Responsibility Centered Management budget sys-tem.
“Under that budget system, the 
revenue from credit hours gener-ated from each department gets a kind of weight,” said Robert Lan-zillotti, former dean of the college of business. “One of the ironies here is the economics department classes taught would generate more revenue as a (College of Liberal 
Arts and Sciences) number than as 
a (Warrington College of Business Administration) number.”Williams said Kraft’s decision 
might be motivated by his being passed up as dean years before he was awarded the position.
“I think Kraft has systematically 
destroyed the department,” said Williams. 
Kraft said there is nothing per-
sonal about what he is doing.
Others say they believe him.“I have thought in the past there 
may be some credibility, but as I 
think about it more carefully, I don’t 
think that’s it,” Denslow said.
There’s been concern the strug-
gles of the economics department may impact UF’s climb to top 10 university status.
“There isn’t a top 10 university 
in the country that doesn’t have a viable economics department,” 
Lanzillotti said.

Nicole Santos said she will al-
ways remember his perfect eyes. 
Sophia Gibaldi said he was one of the better actors. Ethan Perry said the whole event was shocking.
Students reacted to the Satur-
day death of Paul Walker, star of the “Fast and the Furious” fran-chise, with an outpouring of sad-ness and social media remarks.
The 40-year-old actor was killed 
in a car accident with his friend in Valencia, Calif. He was riding in his red Porsche with his friend 
and former ﬁ  nancial adviser Roger 
Rodas when the car hit a tree and light pole.
He was in California to attend 
an event beneﬁ  ting his organiza-tion Reach Out Worldwide, which sends resources and services to natural disaster sites.
Santos, a 20-year-old UF ap-
plied physiology and kinesiology junior, said she found out about the accident on the Internet.
She said it made her especially 
sad because she met the actor on a plane ﬂ  ying to L.A. She said he was nice, polite and welcoming. 
On the silver screen, Santos said 
she thinks the “Fast and Furious” 
franchise will kill his character in the next movie in the series.
“Especially because it’s true 
now,” Santos said.
With the seventh “Fast and Fu-
rious” ﬁ  lm currently in produc-
tion, Richard Burt, a UF professor of ﬁ  lm, mass media and digital media, said he agreed that it’s hard 
to predict how the franchise will be 
affected by the loss.
UF telecommunication senior 
Ethan Perry, 22, said Walker’s character, police ofﬁ  cer Brian O’Connor, was vital to the story and that he hopes the ﬁ  lm’s writers will give him a good ending.
In reality, however, Perry said, 
some students aren’t making ap-propriate comments about the event as news of the accident trav-eled quickly over social media out-lets like Facebook and Twitter.
“I’ve seen a lot of tasteless jokes 
on Facebook,” Perry said. “Celeb-rities are still human.”
UF environmental engineer-
ing freshman Sophia Gibaldi, 18, said she saw a lot of Facebook posts mourning the actor’s death. Gibaldi thought the accident was a traged, she said. 
Althoughshe liked the car-
racing franchise, she said she speciﬁ  cally liked the actor in the adventure drama “Eight Below.” She said it brought out Walker’s emotional side more than the ac-tion series did.
Twenty-year-old UF theater and telecommunication junior Drew Bryan agreed. She said she was glad he could have different roles to show his acting range.
“He probably could’ve done so 
much more,” Bryan said.

ORLANDO — The ﬁ  rm hired to provide security for 
George Zimmerman and his family while he awaited trial 
for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin has reached a settlement with the former neighborhood watch volun-teer and his attorney.CMR Associates settled a lawsuit against Zimmerman, 
his wife Shellie and attorney Mark O’Mara last week.
Under the settlement, CMR Associates will be paid 
$30,000.
The private investigation ﬁ  rm claimed they were owed 
$27,000, plus interest for past-due invoices, for their work in providing security for Zimmerman and his family while he awaited trial in 2012.
Zimmerman was acquitted last July of any crime for 
the shooting of 17-year-old Martin, which occurred in February 2012.
The ﬁ  rm says it provided a two-man detail around the 
clock to Zimmerman and his family members in the sum-mer of 2012.Security ﬁ  rm settles with George Zimmerman, lawyer O’MaraReader response

Calling all future Dave Barrys, Maureen Dowds, Carl 
Hiaasens and Thomas Friedmans: The Alligator is ac-cepting applications for Spring 2014 columnists, and we 
want YOU. 
The Alligator publishes ﬁ  ve times a week — Monday through 
Friday — during the Fall and Spring semesters. This means we need students of every age, major, year, political ideology and walk of life to write weekly 500- to 600-word columns.
If you’re interested in becoming a columnist, you should 
submit to opinions@alligator.org a resume, a brief cover letter explaining why you’d be a good ﬁ  t for the position and a short explanation of your political persuasion — conservative, liberal, libertarian, socialist, etc. Please keep in mind that “Republican” and “Democrat” are parties, not ideologies.
If you have been previously published or keep a blog, please 
send three examples of your work. If you have not been pub-lished before, you may send two 500- to 600-word writing sam-ples demonstrating what your work for the Alligator would be like. 
Applicants should be able to produce articulate, thought-pro-
voking analyses and commentary on current events. Anything is fair game: domestic and foreign politics, pop culture, health, environmental issues, personal ﬁ  nance, sex and relationships, 
issues facing minority communities and campus politics. 
We’re looking for strong writers familiar with basic elements 
of style and who have a passion for deadlines and AP Style. A 
sharp sense of humor helps. 
If you apply and are not selected as a weekly columnist, we 
still strongly encourage you to submit guest columns and let-ters to the editor. We accept these submissions throughout the semester and value input from our readers on campus happen-ings, local, state and national politics and anything else that ap-
pears on the op-ed pages.
Guest columns should be about 450 words, and they should 
include the author’s name, year, major and the school he or 
she attends. All statistics, references, facts and ﬁ  gures should be sourced and cited. Letters to the editor should be about 200 words and should include the author’s name and any relevant information — major, organizations he or she belongs to, etc.
Above all, a columnist’s job is to take a stand using facts and 
reputable sources to defend his or her opinions. 
Columnists should frame their arguments in an articulate, 
structured, succinct manner and should strive to present origi-nal topics and material. 
At the Alligator, we value integrity, professionalism and 
honesty at all times. 
Alligator columnists earn more than just a line on their re-
sume: As a columnist, you have the opportunity to build a pro-fessional portfolio of published clips to show future employers your ability to communicate clearly, write with authority and 
poise, meet deadlines and work with editors. 
Plus, you can mail your grandma clips to show off to her 
book-club friends. Everyone wins.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgMonday’s question: Are you ready for 
the semester to be over? Today’s question: Do you use periods at the end of 
your texts?Bye UF, remember: Journalism isn’t dead
It’s 4:30 p.m., and I’m sitting alone in the newsroom.
The day staff are working on papers and ﬁ  nances, 
answering phones and getting ready to go home. I’m 
at my desk, listening to Ben Folds below a promo photo 
the Alligator received years ago.
In it, Danny Glover looks to the front of the news-
room, and on yellow legal paper above him, says, “I’m 
getting too old for this s--t!”
I have spent the last three years, on and off, at this 
paper, and it’s given a lot to me. I’m proud of photos 
taken, stories written, meetings held, stories rewritten and everything else that’s happened under this ‘70s frat 
house roof.
Even when the roof leaks.
Looking around, there’s memorabilia all around the 
newsroom to remind us on a daily basis that newspa-
pers are over the hill. We’ve carried on anyway, poster-
ing two- and three-deep over these relics with inside jokes and good examples set by others.
There are even some good digs at us plastered up 
on these mismatched walls. My favorite is the “wall 
of shame/hall of fame” in Sports, displaying years of 
mistyped headlines, players’ names spelled wrong and failed attempts at sports humor.
In all fairness to Sports, if News had something simi-
lar, we’d need a bigger building.
I’ve heard that time speeds up as you get older, so 
maybe that’s why these last few months have brought a dizzying array of new journalism — good journalism — from good journalists like the ones I’ve worked with 
since moving to Gainesville.
And I’m incredibly proud to have been involved in 
some of it.
As a journalism student, I think we have an acute 
sense of what is going on in the industry. My ﬁ  rst jour-
nalism professor spent the ﬁ  rst class of the semester try-ing to convince us to switch majors before it was too late.
But the Alligator will persist, 
despite the vitriol we receive 
all the time. Or, for that matter, 
despite the hate any newspaper gets.
 Just recently, The New York 
Times’ paywall overtook its digital ads in revenue. That’s as good of a sign as any of us will 
get.
Some of the great folks from the J-school and I will 
soon be crossing the graduation stage into the job mar-ket, essentially with no guarantee of a career in what we currently know to be journalism. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little scared, but I see where Alligator alum 
have gone in life, and it makes me a little more conﬁ  -
dent.
I’ve heard it said a lot, but it bears repeating: Journal-
ism isn’t dead just yet.
I have a list of advice people have given me or I’ve 
seen somewhere that merited writing down. The most relevant one in my career right now is this: “Remember that everything we’re working with will be stoneaged soon. Figuring out why is the essence of innovation.”
There are some traditions worth keeping, like my 
Danny Glover photo, and there are others we can learn from to leave critics’ mouths hanging open the next time around.
For instance, I’m normally pretty punctual. This se-
mester has been killer, though, and although I don’t think my output has suffered, my schedule has. Keep-ing that in mind, and in the true spirit of journalism, I wrote this goodbye column just before deadline. Que 
será, será.
Thanks for the times, y’all.

Consider getting involved in civil work
As a rule, we get the government we 
deserve. Political institutions work well 
when citizens are engaged: following the news, electing good representatives and pitching in ourselves to address serious 
national problems like health care and na-
tional security. When people are detached, governments generally fail.
So, where are we going to get more ac-
tive and responsible citizens?Civic engagement that improves the 
world almost always has three character-istics. It is deliberative: Citizens talk and 
listen to fellow citizens who may disagree 
with them. It is collaborative: Citizens actu-ally roll up their sleeves and work togeth-er, building or saving or producing goods. And it creates partnerships among people who want to improve the world together.
If you are not doing civic work, you 
should think about getting involved. Many thousands of college students are volun-teers and activists. If you are already active, you should connect with other people who 
are also involved. Even if they work on dif-
ferent issues or come from different com-munities, they face the same challenges.
Why do schools and colleges offer so 
little civic education? Why is so little fund-ing available for citizens’ groups? Why do the news and entertainment media rarely depict citizens working together to address problems?
You need to sit down with other active 
citizens to discuss how to change policies, 
laws, funding streams and media coverage 
so that citizen work can ﬂ  ourish and pros-per again. 
That will begin to build a movement of 
active citizens, which is the only thing that can improve our democracy.

Letter to the Editor
The general pub-
lic’s reaction to the New Miley 
has been like ﬁ  nding a tarantula in the bath-
tub while somehow 
also witnessing a hor-riﬁ  c train wreck. Fear, disgust, concern and morbid curiosity have all been rolled up into a giant ball of emotion that has fueled media cov-erage of the star’s transformation, as well as Twitter jokes and YouTube 
“Wrecking Ball” parodies ad nause-
um. Most people view the New Mi-ley as a loathsome, offensive brute; yet they can’t look away.
The New Miley is only a few 
months old — three or four months, depending on which timeline you prefer — but the transformation has already garnered enough attention to 
make it one of the most memorable 
stories of 2013. General consensus re-
fers to the moment she cut her hair as 
the point when the Old Miley faded 
away into the now seemingly distant past. She was no longer a living ver-sion of the sterile fashion dolls that were so popular when she lived half her life as Hannah Montana. Physical 
transformations came ﬁ  rst, and then 
she switched record labels and hired Britney Spears’ old manager.  
Since then she has broken up with 
her ﬁ  ance, rapped, admitted to using drugs and compared herself to Sinead O’Connor; all of those things, not to mention her VMAs performance — as if it hasn’t been mentioned enough 
already — have been enough to shock 
and horrify much of her previous fan-
base and most of their parents. Cyrus 
is, gasp, acting the way many people 
in their 20s would if they had nearly unlimited wealth, fame and extensive connections in the U.S. entertainment industry, and they hate it.  
This makes sense. It 
is also stupid; at least, 
the controversy is stu-
pid. Had anyone else skipped the Disney-child-star-omg-it’s-Bil-ly-Ray-Cyrus’-daugh-
ter-on-TV-how-cute route to stardom and began where Miley is now, no-body would care.  
Like Holden Caulﬁ  eld or the guy 
who shot John Lennon, they would prefer Miley to retain her childhood innocence at the expense of her growth as an artist and as a person. Even if it didn’t occur to many, the fact that Miley would eventually grow up was predicted in a 2008 Time maga-zine article written by former child star and Mormon Donny Osmond. 
The image change has as much 
to do with music as it does identity. 
Though she’s not currently taking the 
most moral or healthy path, it’s un-
deniable that her music is beneﬁ  ting from the change. It’s more relevant, entertaining, and, partly because it doesn’t sound like karaoke music, has more artistic merit than the music 
of Old Miley.  
Compare “Wrecking Ball” to “7 
Things.” Her new work, though, is 
garish, neon and plastic, and has soul. The Old Miley was little more than a Disney-World animatron, a mouth-piece for the industry’s candy pop and country. People are disturbed by the change, and that’s fair, but 
the Old Miley is never coming back, 
which is nice.
The New Miley is almost too good 
to be true.

opinions@alligator.org“The Hunger Games: Catching 
Fire” does not have one single good scene.
Now before fans of the series volun-
teer me as tribute, let me ﬁ  nish my bold 
thought.
“Catching Fire” does not have one single good 
part, because every part of it is phenomenal.
The culmination of an entertaining story, 
an extremely talented cast, and a bold intensity 
makes the “Hunger Games” sequel a superior ﬁ  lm in every sense. It isn’t just an improvement for the series; it’s an improvement in contempo-rary blockbuster cinema.
After a monumental win in the 74th Hunger 
Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) return to District 12 to start their victory tour.
Unfortunately, neither tribute can ﬁ  nd any-
thing victorious about it. Both struggle to as-similate back into regular life and are forced to continue faking a celebrity romance for the press, much to the displeasure of Katniss’ original love 
interest, Gale (Liam Hemsworth). To make mat-
ters worse, the tour sparks uprisings around the country, only strengthening President Snow’s (Donald Sutherland) personal vendetta against Katniss for her bold actions against the Capitol in the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  lm. The new Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) poses a solution to the president — choose the tributes for the 75th Hunger Games from past survivors.
Here, “Catching Fire” could have made the 
mistake of other sequels and simply remade the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  lm in a different setting. Not only does di-rector Frances Lawrence prevent this cop-out, but he improves on the original’s weak points.
The stakes are higher both in the arena (kill-
er baboons and poison fog are only two of the new obstacles in the Games) and in the politi-cal turmoil. Although the ﬁ  lm is two and a half 
hours long, even pacing keeps the action excit-
ing throughout (in all honesty, I could have sat through another 30 minutes, but Hollywood loves its cliff-hanger endings).
Scenery and costumes, normally taken for 
granted, keep the dramatic tone. The dilapidated districts are dressed with unforgiving snow and rebellious ﬁ  res as the military tries to restrain any potential uprisings. The Capitol, decorated with 
extravagant trimmings, makes a striking societal contrast. Men and women in gau-
dy attire offer Katniss and Peeta a purple drink that makes them throw up so they can keep eating, and all the heroes can think about 
are their starving neighbors back home.
Action sequences in the Games and through-
out the districts bring a new level of intensity. Plot twists gave the characters something to lose, and the audience a reason to sit on the edge of their seats. More screen time for returning characters allows for more development, especially from Hemsworth, who was severely overshadowed in the ﬁ  rst installment, and Sutherland’s increas-
ingly evil and intimidating Snow. And although  
Hutcherson may not bring the same vigor as his brilliant female co-star, their compatibility makes them a winning duo.
Despite the strong original cast, newcomers 
ﬁ  t right into the all-around chemistry. Hoffman’s character may be a bit predictable (coming from someone who has not read the book), but he brings a tangible connection between the Capitol 
snobs and the common folk. Sam Claﬂ  in and Jena 
Malone as fellow tributes Finnick and Johanna keep the games entertaining with new perspec-tives, especially with Malone’s snarky comments against the Capitol.
Lawrence, however, steals the show as the 
stubborn, determined Katniss. It has only been three years since her breakout role in 2010’s “Winter’s Bone,” but Lawrence has already de-
ﬁ  ned herself as an actress, winning an Oscar last 
year for “Silver Linings Playbook.” She embraces the depth of Katniss’s inner turmoil against the status quo, constantly debating between stand-ing up to injustice or risking the lives of those she loves. The director is wise to allot a fair number of facial close-ups on the actress, as her expressions give such sincere emotion to let audiences con-nect with Katniss on another level.
“Catching Fire” is nothing short of stunning. 
Any movie that brings the audience into the story is impressive, but the talents of both Lawrences transform every theater into the world of Panem and delivers a story that is captivating for all theatergoers. That could pose a problem getting seats. May the odds be ever in your favor.

Today, the Student Senate at UF 
will attempt to pass an anti-BDS bill titled “Resolution 
Condemning the Boycott, Divest-ment, and Sanctions Movement.”
This bill is a direct attack on Pal-
estinian students and a negation of their existence at the university. The claims it makes are far-fetched, and many of them are actually factually incorrect. The point of the bill is to assert that UF and Israel have spe-cial ties that would be broken by a BDS bill, and as an American institu-
tion, the school must support Israel 
as a political ally.
There are thousands of students at UF who are explicitly marginal-ized by this bill. Using the claim that UF has the largest Jewish student population outside of Israel leaves out the fact that there are countless 
Jewish allies who are against the ex-
plicitly illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. The writers seem to forget about massive orga-nizations such as Jewish Voice for Peace, Jews for Palestinian Right of Return and Jews for Justice for Pal-estine, just to name a few. Not to mention the many pro-Palestinian 
Jewish students attending UF right 
now, many of whom are members of Students for Justice in Palestine.Furthermore, the bill seems to 
work on the assumption that BDS is a divisive tactic but conveniently leaves out the fact that these compa-nies actively engage in illegal acts of violence against Palestinians every single day. Passive divestment is exactly that — passive divestment, and a refusal to engage in these il-legal violations of human rights. 
Maintaining active relations with 
and investing in companies that vio-late human rights, however, is the most divisive act possible.Not to forget that many facts 
stated in the bill are simply incor-rect. The clause bringing up Hebrew studies is irrelevant, as Hebrew classes and Jewish studies classes 
would be entirely untouched by a 
BDS campaign. BDS targets institu-tions and not individuals. There-fore, the clause on having “multiple doctors at the University of Florida Shands Hospital (who) have studied and participated in research in Israel that has enabled them to further their medical knowledge” is, as well, 
meaningless and irrelevant. Having 
BDS implemented would change nothing about the situation for these doctors, nor would it have affected their capability to study in Israel.
The clause on drip irrigation tech-
nology is, as well, entirely irrelevant and yet again false. BDS has noth-
ing whatsoever to do with divesting 
from Israeli technologies.
The fact that the writers of this 
bill resort to inserting clauses with false statements and literally made-up facts proves that it stands on shaky foundations and has no place at this university, and as students, we refuse to stand for it.

president of UF Students for Justice in Palestine.

As a 10-year-old girl, Gwen 
Thompson’s role model was Willy 
Wonka.
Now 54, Thompson and her hus-
band, Ted Snow, are chocolatiers 
and own Goodness Snow’s Artisa-
nal Trufﬂ  es & Chocolate, a startup chocolate company in Gainesville. 
In the six months since they 
started the business, UF alumni Thompson and Snow have become frequent vendors at farmers markets throughout the week.
Their itinerary includes the Tioga 
Town Center on Mondays, Union Street on Wednesdays, Flagler Beach on Fridays and Haile Plantation on Saturdays.
She said business has picked up 
with the holiday season. So far, best-sellers are the chocolate trufﬂ  es, bark and Oreos.
“It was like as soon as weather 
got cooler, somebody ﬂ  ipped a switch and everybody wants choco-late now,” she said.
The couple also sells chocolate 
chip cookies and chocolate-dipped pretzel sticks and fruit. 
The company registered with the 
state in June 2013 and participated in its ﬁ  rst farmers market at the end 
of June. They forge their creations 
at Blue Oven Kitchens, a certiﬁ  ed kitchen that is an incubator for small startup businesses to use.“I’ve always loved chocolate. 
That’s my inspiration and that’s why I do it,” she said. “One of the 
other things I really like about being here at the market is I can get other 
foods (by) trading my chocolates.”
She said in the future she hopes 
to have a commercial space of her own where she can have her choco-late tempering machine to make the treats.
“If I had that in a place where I could go in every day instead of just once or twice a week, that would really rock my world,” Thompson 
said.
Suzy Schrimsher, a 20-year-old 
UF family youth and community 
science junior, said she took her boyfriend to the farmers market on Union Street Wednesday night, and they stopped at Goodness Snow’s.
“We were just walking around 
and it obviously caught our eye be-
cause all they sold was chocolate,” 
she said. “That’s my favorite food.”
She said Thompson and Snow 
were easy to talk to, and they let them sample different chocolates.
Schrimsher’s boyfriend, Harrison 
Collins, tried the chocolate when he visited Gainesville recently. The 21-year-old University of Tennessee 
marketing junior said it was the best 
dark chocolate he’s tasted.
He said compared to store-
bought chocolate, Goodness Snow’s chocolates tasted more organic.
“You can almost taste every little 
ingredient that she put into it,” he said.
When he comes back to 
Gainesville, he said, he plans to re-turn to the farmers market to get more goodness from Goodness Snow’s.
Schrimsher said she likes to 
support local business and would be likely to go back to Goodness Snow’s.
“Especially those chocolate lov-
ers like me, I’ll deﬁ  nitely tell them about it because it was really good,  and they were really nice people,” she said.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2013

Students gathered for a brief candle-
light vigil at about 8:30 p.m. Monday on 
campus to commemorate those lost and af-
fected by the Philippine Typhoon Haiyan.
Andrea Espulgar, a 22-year-old food 
and resource economics senior and presi-
dent of the UF Filipino Student Asso-
ciation, said the event was one of several 
fundraisers put on by FSA since the disas-ter.
Espulgar said donations collected from 
these events have helped her organization 
raise about $2,000 of its $2,500 goal. One hundred percent of the proceeds go to-ward disaster relief for the victims.
“It’s not just because we’re the Filipino 
Student Association, but because we’re a 
family,” she said. “Even though a lot of us 
didn’t grow up there, our homeland is re-
ally important to us.”
The ceremony began with the Philip-
pine national anthem, sung in Tagalog, the language of the Philippines.
Abby Estilong, 49, then spoke about the 
effects of the strongest storm the Philip-pines has ever experienced and the devas-tation the island nation has faced. 
“This was not a Filipino disaster; this 
was a global event,” she said to the crowd of about 50 students.
Estilong is the adviser for UF’s Filipi-
no Student Association and a member of the Philippine-American Association of Gainesville and Surrounding Areas. She 
has been a liaison between this community 
and students for about 15 years, and she said she is “very proud” of the actions of the students after this disaster.
“We have a Filipino association here 
in Gainesville, and we didn’t have to tell them to do it,” she said. “They came up with it on their own.”
UF students who attended, like Jason 
Feliciano, a 19-year-old public relations sophomore, called the event  “really well-put-together.”
“I think it’s amazing when people get 
together and do something to commemo-rate their ancestry,” he said. “To see them put something on for so many people they 
didn’t know, it’s just a fantastic thing.”

Kenny Nguyen strolled onto 
the weatherworn dock, a bulky 
wakeboard under his left arm and a thick lifejacket over his right shoulder.
He scanned the quiet lake. Con-
ditions were almost perfect.
One by one, six more members 
of the UF Wakeboard Club grog-gily made their way to the final practice of the year. Following the Southeast USA Wakeboard Colle-giate Regionals at Lake Wauburg 
last month, novices showed up to 
try new tricks, while experienced teammates fine-tuned techniques.
UF applied physiology and 
kinesiology freshman Erin Water-man, 19, said Friday practices are typically for beginner riders. Thursdays are reserved for first-string competitors.
“I’m not Thursday material,” 
Waterman said. “I’m lucky to come out Friday.”
But because the season was 
ending, it didn’t seem to matter whether it was a wakeboarder’s first time behind the boat or thou-sandth. The warmth of the sun and stillness of the wind created an ideal day for gliding across the lake.
First up was first-year UF as-
tronomy graduate student Nolan 
Grieves.
While the crew geared up the 
boat, the 22-year-old slipped his feet into wake boots and buckled 
in. When the boat idled away to-ward the northern shore, he re-mained standing, strapped to the board still on the dock.
Then, with a deafening roar 
and a forceful jolt, the boat raced forward, causing water to gush from behind the engine.
Grieves gracefully hopped onto 
the water and carved into the sur-face, eventually performing a tan-trum, an invert and a scarecrow.
Grieves was one of the nine 
team members who competed at regionals. Although there are about 30 students in the club, only the best compete.
“We invited 10 or 12 other 
collegiate schools, and we had a regional contest qualifying for USA Wakeboard Nationals,” said 
Aaron Alanguilan, a 20-year-old 
UF mechanical engineering junior. “We placed first ... so I’d say that’s a success.”
Despite the club’s competitive 
edge, all members maintain a no-judgment attitude.“You know you’re physically 
capable of doing it,” Alanguilan 
said. “It’s just a matter of you hav-
ing faith in yourself.”
Next was Nguyen.Rather than sliding into the 
standard boots, Nguyen, a 20-year-old mechanical and aerospace en-gineering sophomore, laced up his black Vans with electric-blue laces. He’s a wakeskater.
“Wakeskating is like skate-
boarding on water,” he said.
If tricks are difficult to land 
while the board is attached to its rider, how much more difficult is it to do an aerial stunt when the board has a mind of its own?The answer was found about 10 
feet high, midair, where Nguyen 
found himself without a landing 
device after ramping off a particu-larly large wave.
“Wakeskating has a very hard 
learning curve,” he said. “I can’t do much, but it’s fun.”
That can-do attitude character-
ized the group of wakeboard club members.
Whether a trick landed or a 
rider got a faceful of lake, the ca-maraderie experienced in the back of a noisy ski boat seemed to be enough to make even the most non-athletic person strap a piece of fiberglass to his or her feet.

A UF student was arrested af-
ter University Police reported she 
drunkenly head-butted and spit at emergency personnel Saturday night near Library West.
Officers charged 19-year-old 
Claudia Gail Pokropinski with battery on an officer and disor-derly intoxication, according to a UPD arrest report.
At about 11:30 p.m., a bystand-
er reported to officers that Pok-ropinski was drunk and said they were “concerned for her safety” 
at Library West, according to the 
report.
When the officer arrived, Pok-
ropinski ran across Plaza of the Americas. When the officer caught her, she began pulling away, kick-ing and threatening the officer. When the officer thought he had her in custody, she head-butted 
him twice in the face, according to 
the report.
She then kicked and spit at 
Gainesville Fire Rescue medical 
personnel while they were evalu-ating her, according to the report.
Officers booked Pokropinski 
into the jail at about 11:45 p.m. Saturday. She was released Sun-day around noon on her own re-cognizance.UF student

On the rise for the last 10 
years, annually reported tick-
related diseases in Florida have 
become so frequent that the state 
now ranks in the top 20 states for such diseases. 
Researchers are still unsure of 
the reason behind the 150 percent increase, but many possible fac-tors have been proposed as the cause, according to a UF News press release. 
“What we do know is that 
ticks are very active in this area,” said Holly Donohoe, an assis-
tant professor in the department 
of tourism, recreation and sport management and associate direc-tor of UF’s Tourism Crisis Man-agement Institute.
The outdoor activities UF stu-
dents might participate in, like tubing down the Ichetucknee River, put them at risk of getting tick bites, Donohoe said.
To decrease the risk of getting 
a tick bite, students should use bug spray that contains at least 20 
percent of the insecticide DEET 
and wear long clothing, she said.
“But that is not always feasible 
in Florida because it is so hot,” 
she said.
If a tick does attach itself, 
students should remove it with 
tweezers, said Donohoe, then see 
a doctor immediately.
Early symptoms of tick-relat-
ed illness usually resemble flu 
symptoms such as rashes, fatigue and headaches, said Donohoe.
Melanie Kropp, a 23-year-old 
first-year student in the dental hygiene program at Santa Fe Col-lege, said she takes extra precau-
tion against ticks when she goes 
camping.
She is concerned about letting 
her dogs outside.
About four years ago, Kropp’s 
dog brought ticks into the house. The ticks laid eggs inside the paint on the walls, and the entire house had to be repainted, she  
said.
For concerned students, UF 
will be hosting an EPI Tick-Borne 
Disease Symposium on Thursday at 9 a.m. to discuss the issues sur-
rounding the increase in tick-re-
lated diseases. 
The symposium will feature 
speakers Dr. Glenn Morris, direc-
tor of UF’s Emerging Pathogens 
Institute and Dr. Paul Mead, chief of epidemiology and surveillance for the Lyme disease program 
with the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention.Tick-related diseases rising in Florida
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — A former 
high-level NASA manager 
who was responsible for help-ing the private sector develop spacecraft pleaded guilty 
Monday in federal court to a 
conflict-of-interest charge.
Edward Mango, 52, could 
face up to five years in prison when he is sentenced next year.
Mango loaned money to a 
fellow NASA employee who was facing criminal charges to help the employee hire an 
attorney. He also urged the 
director and human resources director of the Kennedy Space Center to be lenient on the em-ployee, who was facing disci-plinary action stemming from the arrest, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release and court documents.
The law under which 
Mango was charged provides 
penalties for government offi-
cials in the executive branch if they advise or help influence a decision in a matter in which they have a financial interest.
Mango had been the pro-
gram manager for the com-mercial crew program at the Kennedy Space Center. The program’s goal is to help the 
private sector develop space-
craft that eventually can take equipment and astronauts to the international space sta-tion.
He also was the launch di-
rector for the first flight test of the Ares rocket, which is being developed to launch NASA’s 
next-generation spacecraft.NASA manager pleads 
guilty to chargeSymptoms similar to the flu 
“What we do know is that 
ticks are very active in this 
area.”

Gators in the NBA
Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah scored 19 points 
and grabbed 10 rebounds during a 131-128 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday night in Chicago.Alex Holston is enjoying a breakout freshman season for the Florida volleyball team. Read

With Week 13 of the NFL season 
in the books, here are a few former 
Gators who made the most tangible impact for their respective teams.
Joe Haden, cornerback: On 
first and 10, Jacksonville Jag-uars quarterback Chad Henne, dropped back, studied his op-tions and slightly underthrew a deep pass intended for Cecil Shorts.
Unfortunately for Henne, 
Cleveland Browns cornerback Joe Haden read Henne’s eyes and made a play.
Haden’s interception came 
in the second quarter of the Browns’ 32-28 home loss to the Jaguars. After making the read, the fourth-year corner proceeded 
to run to his left and return the 
pick for 13 yards to Jacksonville’s 47-yard line. 
During the game, Haden also 
recorded three tackles and broke up a pass. After his pick Sunday, Haden has four interceptions on the year — tying him for fourth most in the league this season. 
All four have come in his past 
four games.
Other former Gators thrive 
on defense: Many former UF defenders filled up the stat sheet this week.

With his team trailing by one in the 
waning seconds, No. 12 Connecticut’s 
Shabazz Napier sunk a game-winning 
mid-range jumper to beat No. 15 Flori-
da 65-64 on Monday night.
The winning shot came after Napier 
was given a second chance on the final 
possession. To the dismay of coach Bil-
ly Donovan, Napier had been given a second chance on the possession before that, too.
Although the Gators (6-2) won the 
rebounding battle 34-26, the Huskies (8-0) grabbed the game’s final three offensive rebounds in the last 1:03 to overcome a 62-59 deficit . 
Patric Young outscored UConn 7-2 
in a two-minute offensive explosion to give Florida the slight three-point lead, but his late-game efforts were erased by his team’s defense giving away op-
portunities. 
After the Gators failed to grab two 
defensive rebounds, Napier knocked 
down the Huskies third attempt from  
behind the arc in just 29 seconds. 
Dorian Finney-Smith fouled Napier 
on the shot, as well, giving up a four-
point play and the lead.
“I was really worried about the re-
bounding part in the zone,” Donovan said. 
“The play that really hurt us was the 
possession (where) we had two oppor-tunities up three to rebound the bas-ketball with a big lineup and we didn’t 
come up with it twice, which resulted 
in fouling a three-point shooter for a four-point play to put them up one.”
When the Gators were forced to play 
from behind with less than a minute re-
maining, they did not have their floor-
leader, Scottie Wilbekin. 
The senior point guard, who re-
turned from suspension a week ago against Jacksonville, left the game with 3:01 remaining after spraining his right 
ankle on his way down from a jump 
shot. 
Donovan said he does not know the 
extent of Wilbekin’s injury.

Florida had a massive help-
ing of humble pie when it lost 
to Georgia Southern two weeks ago.
When the Eagles pulled off 
the unfathomable in The Swamp, 
the victory was expected to re-
verberate for years.
Who knew it would manifest 
itself onto the plates of Georgia Southern students?
For the first day of classes 
on Monday following Thanks-giving break, Georgia South-ern held a “Southern Feasts on 
Gator” cookout at the dining 
hall featuring fried alligator, buffalo alligator bites and alli-gator sliders. 
The Gators were gator bait.School president Dr. Brooks 
A. Keel, football coach Jeff 
Monken and Eagles mascot Gus 
help serve more than 200 pounds of fresh alligator to students, faculty and staff at the Dining Commons, which is one of two 
dining halls on the Statesboro, 
Ga., campus. 
“Since Georgia Southern’s 
students were gone on Thanks-
giving break following our win, 
we wanted to offer a way for them to celebrate upon their return,” Director of Residential Dining Greg Crawford said. 
“To say the event was a suc-
cess would be an understate-ment. We were out of alliga-tor menu offerings within an 
hour.”
Florida paid $550,000 to host 
Georgia Southern at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Nov. 23. The Eagles pulled off the first-ever 
victory for an FCS team against the Gators. 
The 26-20 loss followed UF 
Athletics Director Jeremy Fol-ey’s well-documented statement voicing his “thousand percent backing” of coach Will Mus-champ. 
Foley reaffirmed his support 
before Florida’s loss against 
Florida State.

went viral, with stories appear-

  Alex Holston is having one of the most 
impressive starts to a career in Florida vol-
leyball history. 
  But without help from a Southeastern 
Conference rival, the freshman would have 
likely never played the sport.
  Growing up, Holston played numerous 
sports rather than focusing her attention 
solely on volleyball. The inﬂ  uence of her cousin, Darian Dozier, who now plays for South Carolina, changed everything. 
  “Everything that she went to do, I did,” 
Holston said.
  That partnership, along with two of Hol-
ston’s older cousins, Jourdan Dozier and Kristen Dozier, who play for Ohio State and George Mason, respectively, helped steer her toward a promising volleyball career.
  The Olney, Md., native did not begin 
playing volleyball until ﬁ  fth grade, when 
she started going to clinics. She did not join a 
club team — critical in the recruiting process  — until seventh grade.
  It was not until middle school, when she 
failed to make the school’s basketball team, that she realized volleyball was the sport to concentrate on. 
  Going into 10th grade, Holston’s club vol-
leyball coach, Joe Moyer, began working tire-
lessly to help her improve. 
  The accolades quickly poured in for Hol-
ston, who became a budding star.
  She was a ﬁ  nalist for PrepVolleyball’s 
National Sophomore of the Year in 2010 and 
National Junior of the Year in 2011, the 2011 and 2012 Maryland Gatorade Player of the Year and the 2011 Metro Player of the Year. 
  Moyer still believes that she is the best 
player he has ever seen. 
  “You could tell with Alex that she had a 
gift from the beginning,” Moyer said. “You could tell with that smooth, lefty arm swing that she was a natural.”  One memory of Holston that sticks out 
to him came during a state semiﬁ  nal game her senior year, when she broke the Mary-land single-match record with 42 kills in four sets.
  “The setter in that match was my daugh-
ter,” Moyer said. “We had a talk before the match and I said, ‘For us to get through this match, you’re going to have to feed Alex — 
starting in the parking lot and ﬁ  nishing in 
the parking lot.”
  
  Holston was the highest-ranked Florida 
signee since Kelly Murphy in 2008. Under coach Mary Wise, Murphy helped lead the Gators to three NCAA Regional Semiﬁ  nal appearances and one NCAA Regional Finals appearance. She now plays for the U.S. Na-tional Team.
  The winning tradition in Gainesville is 
what helped convince Holston to sign. She 
said she knew she wanted to leave home and 
the cold to go to an SEC school. The decision ultimately came down to LSU, a school in an area where members of her family live, or Florida. 
  “My dad let me make the decision,” Hol-
ston said. “He didn’t want to make the de-cision for me. I guess just me talking about Florida all the time and how excited I was 
to be here made him OK with me going so 
far away.” 
  While the Gamecocks may have a starter 
for years to come in Dozier, the Gators found a potential superstar in Holston.
  Despite being a true freshman, the right-
side hitter currently ranks 30th in the nation in hitting percentage at .390. Holston and the Gators have both unexpectedly beneﬁ  ted from the graduation of former right-side hit-ter Tangerine Wiggs. 
  Freshmen rarely get playing time in 
Wise’s system — let alone the amount of playing time Holston has seen — but the of-fense needed someone to step up and replace the 245 kills Wiggs registered last season.
  “We recruited her with the thought that 
we needed a right-side player because of the 
graduation (of Wiggs),” Wise said. “Chloe 
Mann did not start as a freshman. There are plenty of talented players who just had to wait their turn and then when the turn comes take full advantage of it.”

    Holston seized her early opportunity and never looked back. 
Her breakout game came against Mis-
souri on Oct. 20, when she led the team with 17 kills and hit .583.
As Florida (27-3) begins NCAA Tour-
nament play against Jacksonville (30-3) on Thursday at 7 p.m., the Gators hope Holston can continue to be a key cog in their attack.
  “She is a freak,” junior Taylor Unroe said. 
“She just does things that a lot of freshme n don’t do, and that’s good for us because I wouldn’t want to play against her. I play against her every day in practice, and she’s so hard to defend.
“ We’re really lucky to have her, and she’s 
carried the load great this season. We just hope she keeps doing that.” 14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2013

   For four teams, the road to 
the national title will run through 
Gainesville. 
  The NCAA announced tourna-
ment seedings Sunday night, and 
Gainesville was selected as one of the host cities for the ﬁ  rst and sec-ond rounds. 
Fifth-seeded Florida (27-3) will 
play Jacksonville (30-3) on Thursday at 7 p.m. in its tournament opener.
  “We expected, with our suc-
cesses this season, to be a top-16 seed, but there is nothing like seeing 
your name printed on the bracket 
with the No. 5 accompanying it — it made it that much more exciting,” coach Mary Wise said in a release. 
  “It means our seniors get another 
opportunity to play in front of our home fans, and we hope that Gator fans, with no other Gator sports playing at home this weekend, can all join us starting Thursday night in the O’Connell Center.”
  The Gators will compete in the 
tournament for the 23rd consecu-tive season and are seeking the pro-
gram’s ﬁ  rst national title.  
Florida has taken seven trips to 
the semiﬁ  nals without a title, which 
is the most Final Four appearances without a championship.  
Florida’s lone NCAA title game 
appearance came in 2003 — a four-set loss to Southern California.  
  The other two teams chosen to 
play in Gainesville are familiar foes.  Florida State (24-7) will face Geor-gia Southern (28-5) on Thursday at 5 p.m.  
S e v e n 
conference opponents 
and eight 
non-conference opponents Florida 
played this year made the NCAA tournament.   
  Missouri is also in Florida’s 
bracket.  The Tigers dominated in both of the teams’ matchups this season, with the Gators falling in four sets on Oct. 20 on the road and 
in three sets at home on Nov. 15. Also, it was   announced Monday 
that four Gators earned All-SEC 
honors.  Freshman Alex Holston, se-nior Chloe Mann, sophomore Ziva Recek and junior Taylor Unroe were named to the 2013 All-SEC Volley-
ball Team. 
  Holston also was named to the 
SEC All-Freshman team, and Unroe 
was named the 2013 SEC Libero of the Year.  
Holston ranks ﬁ  fth in the SEC 
and 30th in the nation with a .390 hitting percentage. 
Unroe is ﬁ  rst in the SEC in aces 
per set at .40.

Watkins gets Senior Bowl invite:  
As the losses kept piling on for Flori-da, one constant remained in the south end zone interview room besides the obvious frustration and tension that 
comes with the worst season since 
1979.
Safety Jaylen Watkins met with  the 
media nearly ever week and never shied away from answering questions, and now he will get a chance to show-case his talents at the Reese’s Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala., on Jan. 25. 
Watkins announced his acceptance 
via Twitter at @jwat14:
“Just accepted my invite to the se-
nior bowl! So thankful #blessed.”
Other notable players attending 
among the 29 seniors include Clemson quarterback Tajh Boyd, Georgia quar-terback Aaron Murray and Vanderbilt wide receiver Jordan Matthews.
Watkins finishes his four-year ca-
reer with 133 tackles and 3 intercep-tions in 48 games. 
He shifted from cornerback to safe-
ty prior to his senior season.
NFL awaits Purifoy: It’s official. 
Cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy is taking his talents to the NFL. 
UF confirmed an earlier ESPN re-
port in a press release on Monday. ESPN’s Todd McShay ranks the junior as the fifth-best defensive back in the draft and the projected 26th overall 
pick. 
“I have had a great three years at 
the University of Florida, but at this 
time I think it’s best for me and my family to pursue a career in the NFL,” 
Purifoy said.
 Bostic, Minnesota Vikings defensive 
tackle Sharrif Floyd and San Francis-co 49ers defensive end Ray McDon-ald each recorded one sack Sunday. 
Floyd also forced a fumble — the 
first of his NFL career — on Chi-cago’s Kyle Long during his team’s 23-20 overtime loss to the Bears. In the same game, Bostic recorded nine tackles and a quarterback hit.
During his team’s 24-17 victory 
against the Washington Redskins, New York Giants safety Will Hill forced a fumble by Washington re-ceiver Pierre Garcon and recovered it with 1:18 left in the game to seal the win. The Redskins had no timeouts 
remaining.
Notes: In his first game with 
the Indianapolis Colts and his first 
regular-season NFL game since Dec. 30, 2012, Chris Rainey returned two kickoffs for 45 yards and three punts for 29 yards. Rainey signed with the Colts on Nov. 20 and will likely be their primary kick returner for the re-
mainder of the season.
Making his NFL debut with the 
Miami Dolphins, running back Mike 
Gillislee ran for 21 yards on six carries during his team’s 23-3 win against the New York Jets. Gillislee, who spent the first 11 games of the season on Miami’s inactive list, filled in for 
Daniel Thomas (ankle), who could 
miss the remainder of 2013.
Dolphins kicker Caleb Sturgis 
went 3 of 4 on field-goal attempts Sunday against the Jets, with makes from 34, 43 and 18 yards out. His miss came on a 41-yard try in the first quarter. Sturgis also assisted a tackle on special teams.
Seattle Seahawks wide receiver 
Percy Harvin (hip) and Washing-ton Redskins tight end Jordan Reed (post-concussion symptoms) missed their respective games this week.
suffered Nov. 18 against Southern.
Without Wilbekin down the stretch, Young and Michael 
Frazier II stepped up offensively. Young scored seven of 
his season-high 17 points after Wilbekin left, and a Fra-
zier layup gave the Gators a 64-63 lead with 18 seconds remaining in the game.
Donovan said he was proud of his offense stepping up 
without a true point guard at the helm. 
However, it was the Gators’ defense that came up short 
Monday night.
Florida forced Napier into an awkward last-second 
shot at the top of the key, but Donovan’s team was out of 
position for the rebound. Napier cleaned up his own mess 
with a put-back as time expired.
“We got him to take a bad shot,” Donovan said. “So, 
our defense was really good. But what happened was the shot goes up, everybody kind of just ran to the rim instead 
of everybody getting matched up man-on-man and get-
ting blocked up.” 
Donovan said the final Huskies’ shot was a fluke play. 
If the ball had landed anywhere else but Napier’s hands, 
the Gators would have won the game. However, he said 
his team gave UConn too many chances to win.
Florida committed a season-high 16 turnovers, includ-
ing a combined 11 from Finney-Smith and Casey Prather. UConn scored 24 points off Florida’s turnovers.
“We self-sabotaged,” Donovan said. “(We) let them 
back in the game, coming surging back.”TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

  Jaterra Bonds sat on the sidelines, watching her father 
coach a youth rec-league basketball game. Suddenly, he 
called her to come onto the court.
  He was down a player, so he put his daughter in the 
game. Onlookers at the Martin Luther King Center on 
Waldo Road knew they were seeing something special.
  Bonds was only 5 years old.  “Everybody must have loved me,” Bonds said. “Be-
cause they said, ‘That girl right there, she’s going to be good.’”
  Now a senior in college, Bonds still has people in her 
hometown talking. She never left.
  Bonds is one of 22 UF athletes who hail from 
Gainesville and the surrounding region, including four from Gainesville High and three  from Santa Fe High.
  Local athletes say campus and the city still feel like two 
separate towns.
 But for residents, these hometown heroes are helping 
integrate the two communities.
  “It’s like I’m living in two different worlds: on-campus 
and off-campus,” Bonds said.
   
  Havana Solaun liked the UF soccer program, but she 
hesitated to enroll at Florida because it was so close to her 
family’s farm on the outskirts of Gainesville.
  “I didn’t want being in Gainesville to hold me back in 
any way,” she said.
  But Solaun had a change of heart. Campus was on a 
different side of town — unfamiliar to her at the time — 
and seemed like “a totally different world.”
  “It was the new start you want when you go to col-
lege,” she said. “I still got that.”
  Solaun said she gets compliments in the grocery store 
and greetings in restaurants from fans congratulating her on a game well-played.
  She enjoys that feeling.  “You deﬁ  nitely get the recognition in Publix and in 
random places around town,” Solaun said. “It’s comfort-ing when you go out to dinner and see someone you know — familiar faces.”
  Solaun, a junior who scored eight goals this season, 
spent many of her formative years traveling. When her 
mom remarried and landed the family on the farm, So-
laun, a seventh-grader at the time, said she was excited about the change of scenery. 
She milked cows, caught chickens and kept working 
on her soccer skills, but she had trouble adjusting to the area.
  “I didn’t initially fall in love with it,” she said.  As she stood in sweats propped up on a pair of crutch-
es, the psychology junior who suffered a recent ACL tear 
recalled how she missed living near the ocean. She had 
wanted to move out of state when she went to college and venture away from her family.
Later in high school, though, her afﬁ  nity for the area 
began to build.
  “When I saw Devil’s Millhopper and all the cool things 
Gainesville has to offer, I kind of started to fall in love with it more,” she said.
   
  Bonds, who is averaging a team-high 17.1 points per game this season, laughed when she admitted she gets local recognition. Sometimes she goes with her family to restaurants that have posters featuring her adorning the walls. She said people she does not know often approach her to talk or offer encouragement.
  “It feels good, but I also learned that you have to be 
humble,” she said.
  For Bonds and other hometown athletes, stepping into 
their role at UF lets them be in the middle of what the town revolves around: sports and academics.
  “Honestly, there’s not much excitement in Gainesville 
besides the football and basketball games,” said Bonds, who likes to spend her free time shooting pool and play-ing Grand Theft Auto 5. “The college students — we make Gainesville. That’s really all it is.”  Local athletes make big impact at UF
