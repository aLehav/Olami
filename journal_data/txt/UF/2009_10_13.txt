Residents travel to D.C. for equality march
* 35 LOCALS DROVE 15 HOURS TO THE EVENT.
By EMILY HANSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Justin Jones, a UF senior, knew at 11 years old that he was
different.
At the age of 16, he confided in friends from school and
church that he was gay.
The word got back to the youth pastor at the church he
attended, and one Sunday Jones was pulled into the pastor's
office to be informed that he was possessed by a gay demon.
The church officials asked permission to pray for Jones. He
agreed, and they pressed their hands on him while praying
fervently to expel the homosexual demon.
After admitting he felt no different, Jones was told he could
&r no longer participate in the choir or any other leadership role
eo? within the church.
Since being cast off by his "church family," Jones said he
has found a new home within the lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender community.
Jones traveled to Washington, D.C., with a group of 35 UF
students and Gainesville residents to show the pride he feels.
The Gainesville chapter of the International Socialist Orga-
nization learned of the National Equality March and contacted
several other local activist groups, realized no one else was
organizing a trip and stepped up to the plate, said Joe Richard,
Emily Hanson/ Alligator a member and organizer for the group.
Protesters wave pride flags and signs in the air before the march begins in McPherson Square in Washington, "Socialists like to support equality whenever we get a

Buses map

Say goodbye to squinting over bus
maps. Starting Monday, Regional Transit
System riders can plan trips with Google
Maps.
Google Transit Planner will benefit
those new to Gainesville, especially UF
and Santa Fe College students, said RTS
spokesman Chip Skinner, who added
that about 70 percent of people who ride
RTS buses are UF students.
"It's going to benefit anybody that's
going to schedule a trip," he said.
The Google Transit Planner estimates
time of arrival, determines the total dis-
tance and cost of a trip and provides
information on the nearest bus stop,
walking distances and road delay infor-
mation.
Skinner said a lot of people were ac-with Google
cessing information on RTS's Web site,
which led them to contact Google and
work out access for Google Maps.
"Over the years, RTS has received nu-
merous calls and e-mails from riders ask-
ing when a Web site trip planner would
be provided, and RTS is glad to be one
of only five transit systems in Florida to
provide this service," RTS Transit Direc-
tor Jesus Gomez said in a press release.
"It's going to benefit anybody
that's going to schedule
a trip."

RTS spokesman
Skinner said the system will reduce
printing costs since more people will be
using the trip planner.

Flu: Teamwork
needed
Teamwork.
Nothing could be
more important
when many stu-
dents, faculty and
staff will have been
in some way af-
fected by this year's
flu virus. Various Phillip Barkley
departments within the university,
along with the Alachua County Health
Department, are working together to
ensure campus safety in response to this
year's HINI influenza illness.
The Student Health Care Center will
assist in vaccination efforts for seasonal
and H IN1 influenza shots. We are
expecting the HINI vaccine on campus
this semester, and a plan is in place to
initially vaccinate those considered high
risk or who have direct patient-contact.
As more doses become available, high
volume vaccination initiatives will likely
occur.
A Web site, http://www.ehs.ufl.edu/
HINI/, will serve as the primary com-
munication tool for university efforts
this flu season -including frequently
asked questions and self-care guidelines.
If you have questions or want to discuss
your symptoms, contact your health
care provider.
The fall is always a busy and exciting
time as we face new challenges, but if we
work together we can meet these chal-
lenges head-on and charge forward to a
successful and healthy spring!
Take care,

Cynda Crawford, D.V.M., mingles with some retired greyhounds.
The flu's gone to the dogsP,
UF veterinarian
Cynda Crawford
is co-discoverer of
the canine flu virus.
Apparently pigs are not the only mammal kind enough to share their flu
with others. Horses now have passed their own flu version, equine influenza, to man's best friend.
The resulting canine influenza virus (CIV) is a new respiratory pathogen in dogs. This is another
instance of mammal-to-mammal transmission of influenza-A viruses, which was previously thought
to occur only between pigs and people.
Cynda Crawford, D.V.M., Maddie's assistant professor of Shelter Medicine at the University of
Florida, is co-discoverer of the canine influenza virus. Crawford led a group of collaborators from
UF, Cornell University, and the Centers for Disease Control in the first identification of the virus as a
cause of respiratory infections in racing greyhounds in 2004. Subsequent determinations found that
the virus was infecting dogs of all ages and breeds throughout the U.S.
The transfer and adaptation of the flu from one mammal host to another is a rare event. Although
uncommon, jumping species is a trademark of the influenza virus, Crawford said.
Fortunately for dogs and their owners, a canine flu vaccine was released over the summer and is
available nationwide. The UF College of Veterinary Medicine worked with pharmaceutical developer
Intervet/Schering-Plough on a consultant basis to create the vaccine.
So far 30 states and the District of Columbia have reported cases of canine influenza, with the
virus most prevalent in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Colorado and South Florida. Recent
outbreaks have occurred in northern Virginia, Connecticut and Atlanta.
Canine influenza is a community-acquired infection, so dogs housed in boarding kennels and
shelters are most at risk. The vaccine is intended for these at-risk dogs, dogs that belong to health-
care providers and kennel staff, and dogs that travel to areas of the country where the virus is more
prevalent.

Org. provides comfort
for HIV, AIDS victims
0 THEY GIVE FREE MEALS
TUESDAYS AND FRIDAYS.
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
A towering statue of Lady Lib-
erty directs people to the Liberty
Center Plaza's exit once they've left
the protection of the structure on
Northwest 13th Street.
On Tuesdays and Fridays, Lady
Liberty has her work cut out for her
when the Gainesville Area AIDS
Project hosts the infected and affect-
ed at the Pride Community Center
of North Central Florida for a free
meal and a few hugs.
And for many of the IV-pos-
itive and people living with AIDS
(PLWAs) who come to GAAP, that's
just what they're looking for.
"We're waitin' on these potatoes.
I got to smash these girls up," hol-
lered Randy Valentine, the GAAP
lunch cook, while preparing a meal.
Valentine used 20 pounds of
ground beef to make a giant meat-
loaf and about 20 pounds of potatoeswith four sticks of butter for a gener-
ous serving of mashed potatoes.
As soon as Valentine moves the
trays of steaming food from the
kitchen to the serving table, those in-
fected with HIV or AIDS, form a line
to help themselves.
To the "friends" of GAAP, it is
not a clinical facility where they feel
the pressures of intimidating ques-
tions or the distribution of drugs.
But GAAP is not a playground.
The friends of GAAP know what
lies before them -ugly truth in a
beautifully cruel world.
"[AIDS] is such a slow, sad
death," said GAAP President Sid-
ney Curtis.
"People don't even know I'm
alive, let alone know I'm here," said
Richard, a friend of GAAP's who
asked not to be identified.
GAAP is run on donations and
has no paid staff. According to a
GAAP brochure, the organization
relies "solely on the generosity of the
community" for its financial needs.
"We've seen a lot of people come
in and out of these doors these past
16 years just looking for some com-
fort," said Kim Howland, Curtis'I97a

Speaker talks about Venezuelan social welfare program
2,000 heart surgeries were performed for free in 2008
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
Tucked between the Essequibo River and
Colombia, resting atop the overshadowing
Latin American country of Brazil, lays Ven-
ezuela, a country Carles Muntaner has been
keeping an eye on for the past 10 years.
In a presentation Monday evening to about
50 UF students and staff, Muntaner, a profes-sor at the University of Toronto, described
the ins and outs of Venezuela's Misi6n Barrio
Adentro (Mission Inside the Neighborhood), a
Bolivarian social welfare program established
under current Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez.
The program seeks to provide publicly
funded education and health care to poor
communities in Venezuela. And the numbers
may speak for themselves.Under Misi6n Barrio Adentro, 2,000 heart
surgeries were performed in Venezuela free of
charge in 2008, he said. There was also a 7 per-
cent increase in the health bud-
On get over the last three years.Campus But Muntaner isn't getting
caught up on the numbers.
"These are just numbers," Muntaner said.
"By themselves, they don't have meaning. It's
about their indication."These numbers indicate that there is a
growth in the medical profession in Venezu-
ela, he said, adding $22 million was invested
in an oncology center in Lara.
Philip Williams, the director of the center
of Latin American Studies, found Muntaner's
evaluations relevant to current studies.
"I didn't know much about this program,
so it was great to have an expert from Venezu-
ela, who is also an expert on public health is-
sues," Williams said.

UF plans to build $61M research center in Orlando
0 THE NEW CENTER WILL CREATE
100 TO 125 RESEARCH JOBS.
By NICOLE LYNN GREINER
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF has moved forward with plans to build
a new research center at Lake Nona.
UF received $6 million for the design and
development stage of the UF Research andAcademic Center at Lake Nona from the state
legislature.
The new building was dedicated Thurs-
day at the Burnham Institute for Medical Re-
search.
The project will cost an estimated $61 mil-
lion. UF is seeking funding for the project,
which will be home to the Orlando campus
of the College of Pharmacy as well as research
development, said William Millard, the execu-
tive associate dean of the college.Millard said the center will bring about 100
to 125 research jobs to the area.
He said the type of research the facility
will conduct has not been
U F decided yet, but they plan to
Research research new drugs with the
potential to become a real
treatment for disorders.
The project has no expected completion
date because of its lack of funding. It is in the
design development stage, said Project Man-ager Eugene Herring.
The building will be four stories tall and
about 60,000 to 65,000 square feet.
Herring also said the primary emphasis of
constructing the building will be energy effi-
ciency.
"It will be a good medical environment
for the students," said Erin St. Onge, associate
dean of the Orlando campus, about the move.
"We are not in a medical community right
now.
D.C. march organizers looked to politician Harvey Milk for inspiration
MARCH, from page 1
chance," Richard said.
The group teamed up with
Pride Student Union at UF to or-
ganize the trip.
Participants paid $80 for a ride
to and from Washington, D.C.,
and lodging in a church on Sat-
urday night.
On Saturday at 4:30 a.m., the 35
participants piled into three vans
and began the 15-hour drive.
The march began at noon on
Sunday, and the chant, "Gay,
straight, black, white. Same strug-
gle, same fight," echoed through
the streets.
The crowd, which included
pop singer Lady Gaga, followed anearly 2 1/2-mile route that took
them past the White House and
ended at the Capitol building.
In a press conference earlier
Sunday morning, the event's ex-
ecutive steering committee ex-
pressed its intention to use the
march as the beginning of a new
strategy for the gay community,
taking inspiration from the 1960s
civil rights movement.
The hope was to inspire "a
generation of Harvey Milks,"
said Kip Williams, co-director of
the march.
Harvey Milk, the first openly
gay man elected to public office,
was assassinated in 1978.
Williams, 27, said the new
movement will focus on obtain-"We're not settling. There
is no such thing as a
fraction of equality."
Cleve Jones

ing full equality, rather than just
equal marriage, citing the equal
protection clause of the 14th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitu-
tion.
March organizer Cleve Jones,
who was played by Emile Hirsch
in the 2008 movie, "Milk," is a
longtime leader of the movement,
beginning as a student intern in
Milk's office during the 1970s.
"We're not settling," he said.
"There is no such thing as a frac-tion of equality."
Williams said Jones is a men-
tor to himself and to other young
activists within the gay commu-
nity because he accepts change
without feeling threatened.
"Often older folks tell young-
er folks to be quiet and to wait,"
Williams said.
But Jones fans the fire in ac-
tivists' bellies by encouraging
young people to effect change in
new ways.
Williams began his career as a
gay rights activist while attend-
ing the University of Tennessee
and now, less than six years after
graduating, he directed a nation-
al march.
He had some advice for stu-dents being told the world is too
big for them to change: Don't lis-
ten.
"All people get told, 'You're
just one person,"' he said
The demonstrators from
Gainesville drove all through
Sunday night and Monday morn-
ing, discussing how to bring
grassroots activism back with
them.
Ford Dwyer, a UF freshman,
was inspired by the march and,
even though he is heterosexual,
decided to become more active.
He said he participated in the
protest because he believes jus-
tice means fighting for equality.
"We all have a stake in each
other," he said.

Distorted Reality
Altered photo glorifies
unrealistic body image
In a recent advertisement for its Blue Label line of jeans,
Ralph Lauren created an advertisement that featured
model Filippa Hamilton in a pair of the brand's $500 Tar-
tan Patchwork jeans.
Unfortunately, Hamilton looked more like Jackie Skel-
lington a la The Nightmare Before Christmas than a human.
In real life, Hamilton wears a size 6 dress. In the ad, she
looked like a size 000. Her head is clearly wider than her
waist, and her arms and legs look like twigs.
Shortly after receiving backlash for the disturbing ad-
vertisement, a spokesman for the company said, "We have
learned that we are responsible for the poor imaging and
retouching that resulted in a very distorted image of a wom-
an's body."
The ethical dilemma of "retouching" Hamilton's photo is
one thing, but for someone out there in AdvertisingLand to
sit down and edit the image and think that her emaciated
frame was acceptable for publication in any medium is dis-
gusting.
If it is physically dangerous for a person to weigh as little
as Hamilton appeared to in the ad, then why glorify that
image through a magazine advertisement for the world to
see?
It is not normal. It is not healthy. It is not attainable.
Advertisements like this one perpetuate the self-loathing
and dissatisfaction associated with eating disorders by mak-
ing women and men think it's normal to weigh 110 pounds
at 5-feet-10-inches tall.
We commend Ralph Lauren for publicly apologizing and
acknowledging that Hamilton looked alien-like. Let's hope
they use some judgment next time before creating false im-
ages of women for the sake of sales.
On The Map
Although the use ofpublic transportation
in Florida is relative-
ly unimpressive overall, Ala-
chua County manages to stay
ahead of the curve.
The county ranks second
in public transportation use
in Florida, behind only Mi-
ami-Dade County.
U.S. Census Bureau data
show that 3.6 percent of
workers in Alachua County
use public transportation to
commute, according to an ar-
ticle in The Gainesville Sun.
We would like to com-
mend the county and the
Gainesville Regional Transit
System for providing afford-
able or free, high-quality
transportation to residents
and students.Many of Florida's major
cities could learn a thing or
two from Gainesville's ser-
vices.
Jacksonville and Tampa
come to mind. Sorry, but the
Skyway just isn't cutting it.
In addition to providing
affordable public transporta-
tion, RTS has teamed up with
Google Maps to make trip
planning easier. Riders can
now get estimates of cost and
travel time and find the near-
est bus stops.
According to RTS Transit
Director Jesus Gomez, RTS
is one of five transit systems
to provide services through
Google Maps in the state.
That's just one more rea-
son why Gainesville is better
than Tallahassee.

Art project puts message before money
P ostSecret, the popular community art project createdby Frank Warren, is the opposite of advertising. And
that's a damn good thing.
The premise of the project is simple: Warren invites peo-
ple to write a secret they've never told anybody before on
a postcard. Then, people mail the postcard to his home ad-
dress, 13345 Copper Ridge Road, Germantown, Md. 20874.
Every Sunday, Warren picks about 20 secrets and posts them
on the PostSecret Web site.
The results are often beautiful. The secrets people choose
to share run the gamut of human emotion -from silly to
tragic, from hopeful to pained -and if nothing else, the
project provides very vibrant proof that, whatever our inner
demons and private joys, we are not alone.
One of the more surprising things about PostSecret is that
the Web site has no advertisements at all. Warren steadfastly
refuses to monetize the PostSecret site with ads, an atypical
move considering that the site has received more than 250
million hits since its inception in 2004, according to Warren.
I talked with Warren about this in a phone interview last
week as a part of his book tour for the latest PostSecret com-
pilation, "PostSecret: Confessions of Life, Death, and God,"
which was released last week.
He said that "having never accepted a dollar for a paid
advertisement" helps foster a sense of trust between the peo-
ple sending secrets and himself.
"I think it's a site where commercializing it would have
a different feel to it," Warren said. He went on to say that
"there's a purity to PostSecret that would be jeopardized by
having ads" on the Web site.
He said he thinks our culture is becoming overcommer-
cialized.
"I think the prevalence of commercials everywhere
is very concerning, and in some ways, it causes us to shut
down what we let in," he said. ".I sometimes feel we aren't
as open to the world as we might be, because we've become
accustomed to trying to shut out some of those stimuli, be-cause there are so many ads and com-
mercials bombarding us all the time."
The more cynical may dismiss Post-
Secret as an exercise in self-absorption
and narcissism -very creative and
-' sometimes touching navel-gazing,
Joe Dellosa perhaps, but navel-gazing nonethe-
Ietters@a Iliigator org less. (It's almost as narcissistic as, say,thinking your opinion is worth shov-
ing into newsprint every week.)
And to some degree, they're not wrong. But PostSecret is
very much a product of our pervasive media-driven world.
It's easy to feel unheard and isolated when countless TV
channels and radio stations clamor for attention, and millions
upon millions of tweets, status updates and blog entries float
around the Internet. It's a cacophony that grows only louder
and more soul-deadening when it's laced with pitches from
companies trying to convince you that Axe Body Spray will
totally get you laid or that using Miracle Whip is an act of ba-
dass rebellion. Closing yourself off to all that is understand-
able, and being closed off from other people because of this is
an unfortunate form of collateral cultural damage.
I understand the role advertising plays in our economy,
and I'm not interested in challenging the assertion that it is
necessary to spur growth or to create an aspirational society.
I do believe that some advertising folks hide behind that ex-
cuse -"We help the economy chug along! We inform con-
sumers of the things they want!" -to impinge upon culture,
desensitize consumers and monetize on people's whims.
I'm convinced that what Frank Warren does is utterly re-
markable. He's created a hauntingly moving art project that
seems to exist for some reason other than to be a vehicle by
which to disseminate ads -an unusual thing in an era of
product placement in movies, TV, football games and song
lyrics. I just wish it weren't so remarkable.

Guest column
Che is a hero, not a terroristNs I walked through Turlington Plaza to
drop off a midterm Friday afternoon, I
noticed a few posters with Ernesto "Che"
Guevara's infamous picture on them. Progress-
ing through Turlington, I saw protesters holding
signs condemning Che Guevara, calling him a
terrorist instead of a hero.
What the protesters didn't mention, though,
was the Batista regime that Che opposed and
overthrew with other Cuban revolutionaries.
Batista seized power and became a dictator in
Cuba, one who was backed by the United States.
He focused his energy on making friends with
the Mafia and amassing great personal wealth at
the expense of his people -a total of about $300
million.
Che did a number of great things for his peo-
ple, and he was a very popular, well-respected
and loved revolutionary of his time. He was a
doctor, and he aided his people by being a physi-
cian for them.
He made it a mission of Cuba to raise literacy
rates, and he did -from 60 percent to 96 percent
in two years. He put in extra hours of field labor
to increase production in Cuba, showing that he
truly cared.
Reading quotes from Che show how muchPaul Mu rty he truly cared about the
Speaking Out people he fought for.
"The true revolutionary
is guided by a great feel-
ing of love," and, "If you tremble indignation at
every injustice then you are a comrade of mine,"
show that he cared. He was from Argentina and
he fought for liberation in Cuba and Bolivia. He
traveled around the globe, including to the U.S.,
to fight for the oppressed. When he was about
to be killed, he said, "I'm thinking about the im-
mortality of the revolution." He wasn't thinking
about his own life, only the life of the oppressed
he fought for.
You may not agree with the way Cuba is now,
and Che probably wouldn't either since he was
quoted as saying, "Cruel leaders are replaced
only to have new leaders turn cruel."
But just because you don't agree with some-
one doesn't make him a terrorist. Che Guevara
did more to fight for the oppressed around the
world than possibly anyone else in the world,
and to protest someone that the CIA killed 31
years ago is ridiculous. The College Republicans
should be ashamed of themselves for sponsoring
the protest.

man's best friend," in Thursday's
Alligator. I am an out-of-state fresh-
man from Philadelphia. Actually I
am from South Philly, so although I
should have "at least two emotional
and psychological disabilities," I
sincerely hope you take what I am
about to say into consideration.
When I first saw a column about
Philly and man's best friend, I as-
sumed it would just focus on the is-
sue of Michael Vick being signed to
the Eagles. However, once I started
reading I saw that animal cruelty is-
sues were being used as a vehicle to
degrade and stereotype the people
from the city I call home.
As in most cities, there are parts
that I would rather not go to that are
known for being notoriously unsafe
and infested with illegal activity.
However, there are many parts of
Philly -even South Philly -that
are beautiful and inhabited by pro-
fessional, upper-class people who
are devoid of any heroin addiction. I
don't know if you have ever been to
Philly, but frankly I don't care.
Being someone who clearly has
a lot more knowledge about Phila-
delphia and city life in general, I feel
as though somehow my opinions on
the matter are a lot more valid than
yours. I was born and raised in South
Philly, and yes, the people there
might be a little loud and maybe en-
joy their Italian food too much, but I
have never met more hospitable and
beautiful people than those I have
been surrounded with my whole
life. Of course, Philadelphia has had
its moments we would like to forget
(the Santa Claus incident), but grow-
ing up there has made me so much
more diverse and appreciate things
outside of my comfort zone.
Philadelphia is an epicenter of
ethnic communities. South Philly is
known for its Italian and Irish influ-
ences, the northeast for its Irish heri-
tage and west and north Philly for
their African-American communi-
ties. To grow up in this city, I had to
adjust to knowing people that think,
look and act differently than I do.
Coming to Florida this summer,
I saw a complete difference in the
people here and the way of life, not
that this is necessarily a bad thing.
However, while all the other fresh-
men barely knew how to cross at a
sidewalk without getting hit by a bi-
cycle or were lost on campus, I was
fine. Living in the city you seem to

Regular cup or cone with this ad.Kaitlyn Flynn despise has
SpeakingOut put meat an
advantage
compared to
the other kids who are also on their
own for the first time. And as far as
being dirty goes, have you ever been
in New York City? What about Bal-
timore? Los Angeles? I shouldn't be
asking this question because if you
had ever spent a substantial amount
of time in a city, you would know
that homeless people, dirty side-
walks and drugs come with the ter-
ritory.
Honestly, the thing that really sent
me over the edge while reading your
article was the way you grouped all
Philadelphians into some degener-
ate, uneducated, life-hating popu-
lation. How can you say that a city
with the No. 1 children's hospital,
two of the nation's top hospitals and
an Ivy League school is filled with
drug addicts? For some reason, I
doubt that the doctors at Jefferson
or the students at the University of
Pennsylvania fit that description.
To say that the people of Philadel-
phia, or "Filthadelphia," if you will,
are inhospitable "to decent human
life," is one of the most disrespectful
things I have ever heard. What about
the three Philadelphia police officers
who lost their lives in the line of duty
this past year? Were they not advo-
cates for human rights? It is a dis-
grace to group all Philadelphians in
the way that you did when so many
have done so much for the people
around them. What about all the
strides the city has made with gay
rights? Philadelphia has one of the
largest gay communities in the coun-
try, with a whole section in Center
City that has gay pride emblems on
the street signs because of its large
LGBTQ population.
I realize this rebuttal might seem
a bit lengthy and you may even think
I'm taking your column too person-
ally, but that's because I come from a
city people are proud to live in.
As a popular saying goes in South
Philly: If you mess with someone I
love, you mess with me too. I'm sor-
ry to tell you this Mr. Maple, but you
have indeed messed with someone I
love.
Do not get me wrong, I love UF
and the people I have met here are
wonderful, but if it came down to
Gainesville or Philadelphia, you can
keep Florida.

UF FOOTBALL
Young gives Tebow
concussion advice a
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
Just about everyone with a
press pass, football ticket or com-
puter turned into a doctor during
the last two weeks to evaluate
Florida quarterback Tim Tebow's
playing status after his concus-
sion against Kentucky, but Tebow
had little use for the opinions.
In addition to the panel of
doctors and trainers advising
him, Tebow got words of wisdom
from another mobile, left-handed
and religious quarterback: NFL
Hall of Famer Steve Young.
Young suffered seven diag-
nosed concussions during his
career, and he called Tebow to
encourage him and share his ex-
periences.
"He told me things that helped
him as far as sleeping and just
resting your mind, doing thingsand not pushing it," Tebow said.
"Something big he said -and
something that I do -is you al-
ways want to just go run around
and do a sprint to see how it feels.
Then you're taking a little step
back. He said, 'Just take time off,
and when they say do your tests,
do them. Don't keep testing your-
self."'
Tebow said he was tested dur-
ing and after Florida's 13-3 win
against LSU on Saturday, but
while he'll continue to be moni-
tored, the frequent baseline tests
he took the past two weeks are
over.
Those evaluations, meetings
with doctors and practicing with
crowd noise convinced Tebow he
was healthy and prepared for the
game environment.
He said he wasn't concerned
with taking hits during the game,
and he was expecting coaches
SEE FOOT, PAGE 16Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff

Butler previews new year
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@a IIigator org
Amanda Butler has an important din-
ner date.
Butler, the UF women's basketball
coach, addressed the media Monday
because of an invitation to a dinner con-
cerning the Jimmy V Classic basketball
tournament.
She said she is excited to be one step
closer to the beginning of the year -the
first day of official practices is Friday.
Butler said the players are ready to
practice as opposed to weight training,
which has been the norm.
With a basketball instead of a dumb-
bell, Butler said practice helps acceler-
ate the integration of new players to the
team.
Entering her third year, Butler has
already matched the school record with
24 victories last season. The team made
it to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tourna-
ment before it lost to eventual-champion
Connecticut."Success redefined what our expecta-
tions were," Butler said.
She is hoping the upperclassmen in-
still the newfound culture of higher ex-
pectations in the incoming freshmen.
Even though the players' faces have
changed, the winning style and expec-
tations Butler brought to UF have been
anything but fleeting.
It was a culture the
Gators saw firsthand
against UConn. Play-
Women's against the even-Women's tual champions, andBasketball the Huskies' home
crowd, Butler and UF
got to see excellence in women's basket-
ball defined.
It will be a tall task for Butler, who
said playing in the Southeastern Confer-
ence is no easy feat.
"We're the best league in the country
in the history of ever," Butler said.
With an expanded conference sched-
ule, the Gators will play two games with
SEC opponents Alabama, Georgia, Van-
SEE W-HOOPS, PAGE 15UF should embrace running identity
he Gators haven't needed to throwthe ball much to win this season, and
they probably aren't going to anytime
soon.
Florida has four players who should get
at least 15 carries per game, and no wide re-
ceiver talent that demands touches.
Only tight end Aaron Hernandez has
proven himself to be a viable option in the
passing game.
With the lack of receiving talent, the
Gators will need to stick to the ground game
if they are going to make it back to the na-
tional championship.
Even though they have a Heisman-win-
ning quarterback, he hasn't been tearing up
defenses for the last three years through the
air.
Let's face it: Tim Tebow has always been
more of a threat running than he has through
the air.
And this season, he has far inferior talent
to dish the ball out to. Instead, all of the tal-
ent is standing right next to him in the back-
field.
Whether it is Jeff Demps, Chris Rainey,
Emmanuel Moody or Tebow, UF is better
off letting them run the ball than trying to
throw 30 times per game.
The Gators' rushing attack is ranked sec-
ond in the nation with 284.6 yards per game,
compared to their 78th-ranked passing gamea
Bobby Callovi
Bobby's World(201.8).
In the three con-
ference games, the
most passing yards
the Gators had was
134 against LSU.
It's not just where
the talent is located
bcallovi@alligator org that figures into the
offensive scheme.
"So much of the game plan is dependent
on how your defense plays, your special
teams play," UF coach Urban Meyer said af-
ter the win in Baton Rouge, La.
The Gators' defense has been the best in
nation, leading the country in total defense,
scoring defense and passing defense.
Although UF is leading the nation in mul-
tiple defensive categories, it is just starting to
return to where it left off last season and is
just going to keep getting better, as hard as
that may be to believe.
There is no reason to take too many risks
through the air with that good of a defense,
that talented of a backfield and that poor of
a receiving unit.
Saturday's game against LSU may have
been boring to many with the lack of a high-
scoring affair, but Gators fans better get used
to it because it is the only way the Gators
will be able to win this season -and maybe
the next couple as well.

SEC expands conference slate
WHOOPS, from page 13
derbilt, Mississippi State and
Tennessee.
In this preliminary stage of
the season, Butler thinks her
team could have "tremendous
balance" and "quality depth."
"We're going to have a couple
of the best shooters in the league
and possibly in the country," sheShe also said her team would
be able to have a lot of combina-
tions and versatility, making her
team harder to guard.
And that is why Butler is so
excited for practice to begin, to
see if all the things she's antici-
pating will come to fruition.

Tim Tebow (18 Pts) 165.91 passer rating, 777 yards, 65.5
completion percentage, 7 TO, 2 INT, 309 rushing yards, 4.3 ypc, 5 TD
Tebow retains his No. 1 spot on our list despite a
pretty lackluster performance against LSU this week.
He accounted for just 172 yards of total offense and
one touchdown. He did, however, break the Tigers'
32-game Saturday night home winning streak in one of the toughest
road environments in the country. The fact that the Gators are No.
1 doesn't hurt.
Jimmy Clausen (17)179.25 passer rating, 1,544 yards,
67.6 completion percentage, 12 TD, 2 INT, 45 rushing yards, -2 ypc
Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis once famously
complained about Florida jumping the Irish in the
polls after the Gators had a bye week. This time, his 9
quarterback benefited by sitting at home and "eating
cheeseburgers." Clausen jumped Colt McCoy and Tony
Pike to move into second place.
SColt McCoy (10) 149.15 passer rating, 1,410 yards, 73.4
completion percentage, 10 TO, 6 IN, 58 rushing yards, 1.7 ypc, TO
If you'd like to see McCoy's stats on the Internet, and
you choose to sort by passer rating, you can find the
Texas quarterback just below FSU's Christian Ponder
at No. 22. Still, our writers are impressed by his
leadership, completion percentage and the fact that his team is still
undefeated.
Tony Pike (9) 159.95 passer rating, 1,493 yards, 66.7
completion percentage, 13 T, 3 INT, 41 rushing yards, 2.9 ypc, 2 TO
Pike suffered from the opposite of the Jimmy Clausen
effect. Cincinnati was off this week and as a result,
its senior signal caller dropped a spot on our watch.
He's another quarterback of an undefeated team on
our list, and he leads all quarterbacks on our top five in passing
and total touchdowns.
Jacquizz Rodgers (5) 697 rushing yards, 5.4 ypc, 13 T,
38 receptions, 269 receiving yards
"Quizz" can send Kyle Maistri a thank-you note for
sneaking him on to the list. The little tailback tied with
Stanford running back Toby Gerhart at five points but
Maistri's questionable first-place vote broke the tie.
Rodgers has accounted for more total touchdowns than Tebow or
McCoy and has only accumulated 120 fewer yards than our first-
place finisher -Tim Tebow. Rodgers terrorized Stanford's defense
in this week's game, going for 189 yards and four touchdowns on
the ground while adding five catches for 82 yards.

Jessica Warshaver /Alligator StaffTebow has little memory of Wyndham hit
FOOT, from page 13
to call plays that would protect
him. On Florida's first three ma-
jor short-yardage situations, Em-
manuel Moody, Jeff Demps and
Brandon James got the carries,
converting one.
"I was being patient with it,"
Tebow said. "That's obviously,
from watching how we usually
play, a little bit different, but I
knew going in that was how it
was going to be. I had to be pa-
tient and trust those guys, and
they did a great job."
Tebow said he had little mem-
ory of being hit by Kentucky
defensive end Taylor Wyndham
when he was taken from the sta-dium in an ambulance, but his
recollection returned during his
hospital stay.
That experience, coupled with
warnings from doctors about
health implications, gave Tebow
the proper perspective on his re-
turn.
"I want to be OK," he said. "I
don't want to be injured or have
brain trauma, I want to be OK. I
think, in a way, it was humbling
because you know at any mo-
ment it can be over. It wasn't
something I could fight through.
It doesn't matter how tough you
are.
"Instantly, it's lights out, and
you don't know how much foot-
ball you have. It's a blessing to getback on the field, and you realize
how much you love the game and
love playing."
ETC: UF coach Urban Meyer said
Monday he's "worried" receiver
Carl Moore won't play this sea-
son because of offseason back
surgery. A decision of whether
to redshirt Moore will be made
in the coming weeks, he said.
.Linebacker Brandon Spikes
was named the Southeastern
Conference Defensive Player of
the Week for his 11-tackle, 2.5-
sack performance against LSU.
.Meyer said he received "non-
stop" calls from Tigers fans last
week, so many that he had to
change his cell phone number.
