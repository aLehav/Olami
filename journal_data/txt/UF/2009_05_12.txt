UF is looking at a possible $49-million cut 
in state funding next year, now that the state’s 
budget has been finalized by the House and Senate.
The budget still needs to be approved by 
Gov. Charlie Crist.
The budget includes about $21 million in 
tuition revenues from the differential tuition bill recently passed by the Legislature and signed by Crist. The bill allows universities to raise tuition by up to 15 percent each year, though UF already had the ability to raise it by that much for some students.
UF is expected to receive about $42 mil-
lion next year in federal stimulus funds, which makes up for most of the cut, but UF President Bernie Machen has said he will not use the funds to cover cuts that affect costs that occur every year, like salaries.
UF is expected to receive another stimulus 
payment of about the same size for the 2010-2011 year.

After publicly apologizing for recent cases of po-
lice misconduct to more than 50 community members at a meeting Monday, City Manager Russ Blackburn discussed future plans for the Gainesville Police De-partment.
“Over the past year, GPD has experienced a num-
ber of actions that don’t reflect the character of our de-partment,” Blackburn said.
He said GPD plans to move forward 
from those actions by building a better and stronger department for the future.
The first step in this process, Black-
burn said, will be to conduct an organizational review of GPD.
Blackburn has made a proposal to the National 
Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, NOBLE, asking it for assistance in the investigations.
The review will look at the recruitment, interview-
ing, hiring, orientation and discipline processes.
After six GPD officers underwent internal investi-
gations in the past year for unprofessional behavior, the review will be looking closely at interview ques-tions and psychological tests administered to appli-
cants to ensure the department hires people who re-
flect the Gainesville community’s ideals, he said.
After the review is over, NOBLE will present find-GPD to review 
hiring process

Ronald Stiles III, a UF senior and recreation 
sports major, died in a surfing accident at 
Crescent Beach, Fla., on April 30. 
Stiles disappeared while surfing, and offi-cers were contacted after his white surf board 
washed up on shore without him on it, accord-
ing to a police report. 
Stiles’ body was found after officers 
searched the area, the report said. He was not 
breathing and had no pulse. 
Stiles was then taken to Flagler Hospital 
where he was pronounced dead. 
Aside from surfing and school, Stiles also 
worked at Café Gardens as a member of the kitchen staff. 
His manager, Devon Vlason, said he was 
always punctual, a hard worker and very reli-able. 
Vlason said the two would 
always talk about music, which was another of Stiles’ passions.
“He loved music,” he said. 
“He listened to everything from punk rock to country.” Vlason said he was a soft-spoken guy, but 
Stiles was never short of a funny story to tell, 
adding he always knew how to make the other 
kitchen staffers laugh. 
“He has a kind soul and a good spirit,” he 
said. “He really cared for his friends.” 
According to UF spokesman Steve Orlan-
do, Stiles’ funeral was held on May 6.
Orlando said he did not know if UF has 
plans of holding a memorial in Stiles’ honor.UF student dies in Crescent Beach surfing accidentNewsLocal

A man was arrested Sunday night after 
police say he shot a convenience store clerk 
in the head with a BB gun during a robbery to “gain street cred” for his rapping career.
At about 9:30 p.m. Friday, a man walked 
into the Super Stop Food Store, 2561 SW 31st Place, holding a BB gun and demanding money. When the store clerk tried to grab the gun, the man shot the clerk in the head, Gainesville Police Department spokesman Keith Kameg said. Then the man and his ac-complice, who was waiting outside with a second BB gun, ran away empty-handed, the report stated. Kameg said GPD received a tip that Steven Gilmore, 21, robbed the store.
Officers obtained a warrant to search 
Gilmore’s apartment and found the two BB guns and the bandana Gilmore wore during the robbery, Kameg said. In an interview, Gilmore told officials of his rapping aspira-tions, Kameg said.

Brazil boosts flood aid for 
308K left homeless 
SAO LUIS, Brazil (AP) — Brazil 
intensified efforts to get food and 
other aid to people isolated by se-vere flooding as waters kept rising in some areas Monday, including 
a jungle river nearing its highest 
level in more than 50 years.
At least 40 people have died in 
the worst flooding in northern Bra-zil in at least two decades, and the number of homeless is now above 308,000. Communities remained inundated despite some easing of rain and two deaths were reported 
in a previously unaffected state.
While officials reported waters 
were receding in most areas, some 
rivers were rising in the jungle state of Amazonas, including the Rio Negro that feeds the Amazon River. It was just 74 centimeters (29 inches) below a record set in 1953 at a measuring station in Manaus, 
an industrial city that is the jump-
ing off point for rainforest tourism, the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency said.
“The situation is very difficult 
because the state is so large and there are places you can’t get to,” said Dorothea de Araujo, the Am-azon operations manager for the 
international aid group World Vi-
sion. “Food and water are priori-ties because people are drinking contaminated water.”
World Vision planned to send 
boats with supplies and doctors to help about 30 Amazon communi-ties, she said.
In the hard-hit northeastern 
state of Maranhao, some roads were reopened and officials using trucks and helicopters began dis-tributing tons of food, medicine, mattresses and blankets flown in on military cargo jets, said Paulo Andrade, logistics coordinator for the state.

Crowd pelts Austin police after fatal shooting 
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — An 
angry crowd threw rocks and 
bottles at police in riot gear in Austin, Texas, hours after an of-ficer shot two men, killing one of 
them.
Police say eight officers had 
minor injuries and eight patrol 
cars were damaged as authori-ties tried to break up the crowd of about 100 people that gath-ered after the Monday morning shooting.
Police Chief Art Acevedo 
said the shooting occurred after police investigating complaints of shots fired over the weekend approached a car with three men inside.
He said an officer shot one 
man who made a movement to-ward a weapon when the officer tried to wake him up, and shot 
another who ran toward him.
Acevedo said the unidenti-
fied officer who fired will be 
placed on standard administra-tive leave.

Pakistan: Up to 700 mili-
tants killed in offensive
ISLAMABAD (AP) — A ma-
jor Pakistani military offensive 
in the northwest has killed up to 700 militants in the past four days, and the operation will pro-
ceed until the last Taliban fighter 
in the area is ousted, the coun-try’s top civilian security official said Monday.
The offensive in Swat and 
surrounding districts has earned praise from the U.S., which wants al-Qaida and Taliban mili-tants rooted out from Pakistani 
havens where they can plan at-
tacks on American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.
But the fighting has unleashed 
an exodus of refugees, and raised concern over the future of nucle-ar-armed Pakistan.
Interior Minister Rehman 
Malik’s announcement of 700 
militants killed came as a witness 
and a police official reported new airstrikes in parts of the Swat Valley, a one-time tourist haven that fell prey to Taliban advances STATE
Fla. Gov. Crist expected to 
seek US Senate seat 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — 
Popular GOP Gov. Charlie Crist 
has set his sights on a U.S. Senate seat, a prize that could help his chances if he decides to run for 
president and boost his struggling 
party even if he doesn’t.
Republican Sen. Mel Martinez 
announced in December he won’t seek re-election in 2010. Crist is expected to announce via e-mail Tuesday that he’s running for the seat, and his strong name recog-nition and high approval ratings 
make him the immediate favorite.
Perhaps more importantly, the 
race could raise his profile if he 
wants to challenge President Ba-rack Obama in 2012.
Crist, 52, was coy Monday when 
asked about his political plans sev-eral times after an event at a local retirement home complex.
“Maybe I’ll have something 
more to say about that tomorrow,” he replied. “I think I’ll issue a state-ment.”
But state GOP chairman Jim 
Greer says he believes Crist, whose was on the list of possible 2008 GOP vice presidential candidates, will seek the seat.
Shuttle Atlantis blasts off 
on last Hubble mission 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) 
— Space shuttle Atlantis and a crew 
of seven thundered away Monday on one last flight to the Hubble Space Telescope, setting off on a 
daring repair mission that NASA 
hopes will lift the celebrated obser-vatory to new scientific heights.
Atlantis rose from its seaside 
pad about 2 p.m. and arced out over the Atlantic, ducking through clouds. The Hubble was directly overhead, 350 miles up.
For the first time ever, another 
shuttle was on a nearby launch pad, primed for a rescue mission if one is needed because of a debris strike.
After seven months of delay, 
the astronauts were anxious to get started on the complicated, riskier-than-usual job at Hubble. They were two weeks away from 
launching last fall when a critical 
part on the telescope failed and picture-taking ceased. NASA de-cided it wanted to take up a spare to replace the broken unit, and it took months to get it ready.
“At this point, all I’ve got left 
to say is, ‘Let’s launch Atlantis,’” commander Scott Altman said just 
before liftoff.
“Enjoy the ride, pal,” replied 
launch director Mike Leinbach.
Atlantis should reach the orbit-
ing telescope Wednesday.

Motorists may notice more fi-
ery-red Indian Paintbrush, golden 
Tickseed, multitoned Phlox and 
several other species of wildflow-
ers along Florida’s roads and high-ways.
This season is yielding large 
quantities of wildflowers for sev-
eral reasons, including  weather 
and better mowing practices, said Gina Busscher, the Department of Transportation’s public informa-tion director for the 2nd District. 
The combination of winter rains 
and late spring cold snaps helped delay the blooms and increase the yield, though the bloom period may be cut short without more rain, she said.
Additionally, better mowing 
practices by contractors may ac-count for increases in wildflow-ers, especially along roads. The department contracts out most of the mowing along roadways and has been training contractors to avoid cutting flowers before they produce seeds.  
“They can’t go to bloom if you 
cut them off too early,” Busscher said. 
Though the program, which has 
been planting in the area for about 
25 years, is primarily aesthetic in nature, it does save the depart-
ment from contracting at least one 
mowing cycle, she said.     
The 2nd District, which in-
cludes Alachua and 17 other coun-ties, receives about 940 pounds of 
seed from Tallahassee annually as 
part of the state’s beautification 
plan, costing anywhere between 
$30 and $50 per pound, according to Busscher.   
Walter Judd, a botany professor 
at UF, is skeptical of the benefits of 
the program. 
“I’m not convinced we’re see-
ing an increase in wildflowers,” 
said Judd, making a distinction be-
tween the department’s roadside 
seeding and naturally occurring 
flowers.  
Judd is concerned that people 
are becoming too complacent when they see the department’s 
work and said he fears a continu-
ing decrease in naturally occurring wildflower populations due to hu-
man involvement and decreases in 
pollinator populations.  
Additionally, the importing of 
seeds from other states concerns Judd.  
“Sometimes the genotypes 
might not match the genotypes of 
the ones in Florida,” he said. “It is 
having an impact on the genetic di-
versity in the environment.” 
According to Busscher, most of the wildflowers that the state 
is planting are native perennials, 
eliminating the need to seed or 
plant over the same areas annu-ally.
The majority of the seeds pur-chased was state wildflower, Co-
reopsis or Tickseed, which can be 
seen along Interstate 75 south of 
Newberry Road together with an-other of the heavily planted spe-cies, Phlox, she said.On Friday, the state allocated 
$20,000 more for highway beau-
tification grants, which includes 
the wildflower planting program, than last year when the 2009-2010 budget was passed. TUESDAY, MAY 12, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 3

� THE EXHIBIT FEATURES MORE 
THAN 100 PIECES OF ART.
By NATALIE ARRIETA
Alligator Contributing Writer
A partnership between the Harn Muse-
um of Art and the Alachua County school 
system is breeding the next generation of student Picassos. 
More than 100 pieces of “everyday art” 
by Alachua County student artists from kindergarten through 12th grade are on display in the Chandler Auditorium until May 17.
The exhibit features artwork from about 
30 schools, with pieces such as landscape paintings, collages, photographs and hand-printed robes inspired by African textiles. 
“This partnership represents the Harn 
Museum’s continuing relationship with the Alachua County school system and supports the museum’s mission to pro-mote the power of the arts to inspire and educate people and enrich their lives,” 
said Bonnie Bernau, director of education 
at the Harn.
“[It] provides the museum with an ex-
cellent opportunity to celebrate student 
artists and the dedication of local art teach-
ers while endorsing our mutual dedication to ensuring that the arts are an important part of children’s lives,” Bernau said. 
The displayed artwork represents the 
climax of a full year of study, which in-cluded a teacher workshop in the fall, a guided visit to the Harn for students and classroom instruction about using the mu-seum’s educator resource unit. 
“Student artists were inspired by good 
teaching and by seeing real art,” Berneau said. “One artist always influences anoth-er.”
A reception was held on April 23 to rec-
ognize students whose work is featured in the exhibition. More than 200 people at-tended the reception, including parents, art teachers and school principals in an ef-fort to support the arts. 
At the reception, students received cer-
tificates from their art teachers.
Florida Capital Bank sponsored the ex-
hibit and reception and will select 21 stu-dent works to display in the bank’s office 
for a year after the exhibit closes.
Justine Michael, a senior at F.W. Buch-
holz High School in Gainesville, has her 
photograph of paint peeling off of a wall 
on display.
“I wanted to be able to show a different 
perspective of something people see every 
day and to make them think,” she said.
“It felt great when I saw my artwork 
on display,” Michael said. “Just having it among the art of great people is an amaz-ing thought.” Harn celebrates ‘everyday’ artwork of local students

good teaching and by seeing real

The Arredondo Room re-
opened as the Arredondo Café 
on the fourth floor of the Reitz Union Monday. 
The café, which serves 
buffet-style meals and offers a panoramic view of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, is the result of construction that combined the Arredondo Room and the Micanopy Room, as well as upgrades that brought the 40-year-old section of the Reitz up to code, according to Mike 
Mironack, director of opera-
tions at the Reitz Union.
“We’ve improved the look, 
feel and function of the room while satisfying some infra-structural needs,” Mironack said.
The construction costs, 
which fell between $500,000 and 
$700,000, included the installa-
tion of a permanent buffet line as well as new lights, furniture, window treatments and speak-ers. New restrooms were also built in the fourth-floor lobby.
Customers slowly trickled in 
and out of the café during its in-ception. UF sophomore Natalie Nelson said she enjoyed being one of the few people there.
“Lot of food, quiet location, 
excellent view,” she said.
The Arredondo Café will be

Frustrated questions regarding the closure 
of Shands at Alachua General Hospital went 
unanswered as Timothy Goldfarb, Shands CEO, was not present at a special meeting held by the Alachua County Commission on 
May 5.
Instead, a two-page letter from Goldfarb 
and a team of assistants recording questions 
and concerns filled his place.
In the letter, Goldfarb expressed gratitude 
toward commissioners for meeting with him individually regarding the impending hospi-tal closure, scheduled for October.
However, some commissioners felt it was 
a mistake for Goldfarb to miss an opportunity for discussion in a public forum.
“I am very saddened he’s not here, that no 
one is here to speak on [Shands’] behalf,” said Commissioner Rodney Long. “This is a very 
important community issue.”
Despite Goldfarb’s absence, community 
advisory groups presented suggestions for 
dealing with the loss of health care services.
Jean Munden, Alachua County Health De-
partment administrator, said the loss of AGH will increase demand for services such as ba-sic medical care, which would be offered by the health department. To meet the demand, 
the department would begin to offer extended 
business hours by July, Munden said.
Beyond the impact of straining other area 
hospitals with patient overflow, the loss of a community hospital is a concern for several community group representatives. 
Ed Jennings Jr., chairman of CHOICES, 
a county health care service provider for the uninsured, said health care access would be 
problematic for many residents.
“The conversation needs to be about what to do now,” Jennings said. “How do we make sure primary care is provided to our most 
needy citizens?”
According to Jennings, about 20 percent of 
Gainesville’s 250,000 residents live in poverty.
Social services program director Candie 
Nixon echoed Jennings’ concerns, saying, “Poor people will not have access to primary care with AGH closing.”
In an effort to curb an influx of patients 
needing primary care, Goldfarb noted in his letter that Shands is working with Solantic, an 
urgent-care provider, to open a center at Ayers 
Medical Plaza.Other issues raised included employee 
placement, increased emergency room wait times and the impact on rural bordering coun-ties. Levy County Emergency Medical Ser-vices Director Trish Seibold said roughly a quarter of the county’s 39,000 residents go to AGH for services.
With only seven total ambulances for the 
entire county, Seibold said the increased wait time for an emergency bed poses a problem.
“Our wait times are anywhere from 20 
minutes to an hour,” she said. “With the hos-pital closing, we’re looking at one-to two-hour wait time.”
 The impact on rural counties is one conse-
quence among many that commissioners hope to discuss in a future meeting to be held within the next 90 days.
Goldfarb is being pressured by the com-
mission to appear at the meeting or provide a representative to address citizen concerns.LOCAL
Commissioners criticize Shands CEO for missing forum
one-time money for recurring expenses,” UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes said.
She said there are still many details about UF’s bud-
get that need to be worked out. 
“It’s unclear at this point what will be cut, how 
much will be cut and how it will be cut,” she said.
Sikes said Machen will brief UF’s Faculty Senate on 
Friday about the budget.
Machen plans to submit his final budget recom-
mendations to the Board of Trustees, UF’s highest gov-erning body, later this month. 
The board will take the final vote on the budget.Under the current version, UF’s state funding in 
2009-2010 would be reduced to about $540 million, not 
including tuition appropriations, Sikes said.
This is down from about $702 million in 2006-2007.
UF’s expected cut next year is about $23 million to 
$26 million less than the $72 million to $75 million re-duction that UF had been preparing for.
“We are in a little bit better shape than we would 
have been,” Sikes said.
Machen asked all colleges and administrative units 
in January to present 10 percent budget cut proposals to the Provost’s office by April 1. They were released to the public on April 16.
A week after the proposals were posted online, 
UF’s Vice President for Student Affairs Patricia Telles-Irvin announced that two programs in her office — the 
Center for Leadership and Service and Multicultural 
and Diversity Affairs — were no longer in danger of being cut.
“These programs are too precious to me and the 
university,” she told about 50 students at a question-and-answer session in the Reitz Union Auditorium. 
She said she would try to find private funds to cover 
the $508,000 cost of the programs, which include pro-grams for black, Hispanic, Asian and LGBT students.
“The funding will be there; I will just have to find a 
different strategy,” Telles-Irvin said.
Despite the announcement, about 30 students 
marched from the Reitz Union to Tigert Hall, where they delivered an oversize letter signed by students to Telles-Irvin, urging the administration to work with students on the budget cut issue.
About 10 students then held a sit-in in the waiting 
area outside Telles-Irvin’s office.Private funding might save two programs
ings to Blackburn and a focus group that will make recom-mendations for changes to 
GPD’s command staff.
At the meeting, Blackburn 
also discussed the search for a 
new chief of GPD.
Twenty-four people have 
applied for the position, after a week of advertising, he said.
GPD’s human resource de-
partment will pick the top 10 
applicants and a selection com-
mittee will narrow that down to four or five, Blackburn said.
“Expect a very intensive, 
painful process that draws out the best in the candidate and puts them under the maximum amount of stress,” he said.
Blackburn is also plan-
ning a public reception where Gainesville citizens will be given the change to meet the finalists and ask them difficult questions.
When the finalists are asked 
to leave the room, Blackburn will talk to citizens about whom they think will best fill the position.
Although current Chief 
Norman Botsford has agreed to continue his duties as chief until Nov. 1., Blackburn said 
he will make the decision for a 
new chief in early August.
The meeting was sponsored 
by the African American Ac-countability Alliance.24 have applied for police chief

Florida had 55 confirmed cases of swine 
flu, including one UF student, as of Mon-
day afternoon, according to the Florida De-partment of Health.
The UF student, a 19-year-old female 
whose identity will not be released, is the only confirmed case in Alachua County.
The student visited the Student Health 
Care Center April 27 with flu-like symp-toms. She left Gainesville for her home-town two or three days later, UF spokes-man Steve Orlando said.
The student had mild symptoms and 
has fully recovered, according to an e-mail 
sent to UF students last week .
Additionally, there have been four prob-
able cases of the swine flu in Florida. The 
state has accounted for about 2 percent of the 2,600 total confirmed cases in the U.S., as of Monday afternoon.Despite concerns about swine flu, 
which is suspected to have come from Mexico, UF’s two summer study abroad programs in Mexico are expected to con-tinue as scheduled. A total of 45 students 
are signed up to study in Guadalajara and 
Merida, said Susanne Hill, interim execu-tive director of UF’s International Center. The program starts June 24.
“We have six weeks before the program 
starts,” Hill said. “We’ll keep watching and hope that things will calm down.”
If necessary, she said UF will make 
changes to the programs, but she doesn’t 
want to see any hasty decisions made.
“These students are counting on getting 
(class) credit,” she said. She said her office has not received calls 
or e-mails asking about UF’s plans for the 
summer programs.
While no students have pulled out of 
UF’s trips, two students out of a group of about 15 have canceled their plans to par-ticipate in an independent program in Gua-dalajara this summer, Hill said.
UF’s graduation ceremonies earlier 
this month also proceeded as planned. About 9,200 students applied for degrees this spring and more than 7,100 students walked, Orlando said. Unlike some other universities, UF decided not to ban hand-shakes in response to the swine flu out-break.
UF decided the outbreak wasn’t as seri-
ous as previously believed, Orlando said.
“We also took into account the fact that 
this is a pretty important event for people, when they graduate and get to shake the (university) president’s hand,” he said. “For many students, this is the only time they get to meet the president.”� HE WAS SCHEDULED TO DIE BY LETHAL INJECTION.

The Florida Supreme Court indefinitely delayed the execution 
of death row inmate John Marek, who was scheduled to die by lethal injection on Wednesday at Florida State Prison near Starke. 
The stay, which was announced Monday, comes 25 years af-
ter Marek was convicted for kidnapping, raping and strangling 
Adella Simmons.
A hearing is set for May 20, when Marek’s attorneys will argue 
that Marek’s accomplice, Raymond Wigley, murdered Simmons.
The stay was granted based on testimonies by  fellow inmates 
that Wigley tearfully confessed to murdering Simmons, said Mil-
ton McClain, Marek’s attorney. In 2000, Wigley was strangled by an inmate while serving his life sentence.
“The state has tried to argue that [Wigley] may have been try-
ing to act tough and impress people in prison,” McClain said. “But 
the manner in which he confessed does not reflect that. Ray broke 
down crying and admitted that he did it.”Since Marek’s 1984 conviction, his attorneys have appealed 
to the Florida Supreme Court six times, and to the U.S. Supreme Court twice.
Marek was also granted stays in 1988 and 1989. Gov. Charlie 
Crist signed Marek’s death warrant in late April alongside that of David Johnston.
Johnston was convicted of strangling 84-year-
old Mary Hammond in Orange County in 1983. Crist has signed five death warrants since Flori-da’s 17-month capital punishment hiatus ended 
in April of 2008.
Court and legal fees for death row inmates 
are costly to the state, said UF criminology pro-fessor Ronald Akers.
The average prisoner execution in Florida 
costs around $3.2 million, while the cost of im-
prisoning the same person for life is about $600,000, according to a 1997 press release on a capital punishment study in which Akers participated.  Akers said that the death penalty does little to deter 
crime, and he feels that it’s not worth the cost.                                                      
“It becomes a more pointed argument in times of economic 
downturns, but that argument has always been there,” Akers 
said.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TEHRAN, Iran — An American jour-
nalist imprisoned on espionage charges in Iran for four months was freed Mon-day and reunited with her smiling, tear-ful parents — a move that clears a major 
obstacle to President Barack Obama’s 
attempts at dialogue with the top U.S. adversary in the Middle East.
The U.S. had said the charges against 
Roxana Saberi, a 32-year-old dual Iranian-American citizen, were baseless 
and repeatedly demanded her release.
Hard-line President Mahmoud Ah-
madinejad could also win some domestic political points a month before he faces a re-election challenge from reformers who seek to ease Iran’s bitter rivalry with the U.S.
Saberi’s Iranian-born father, Reza 
Saberi, wiped away tears, then flashed a broad smile as he and his wife, Akiko, 
arrived at Tehran’s Evin prison — notori-
ous for holding political prisoners — to meet their daughter.
The younger Saberi, who was taken 
out of Evin through a back door away from journalists, was not seen after her release. She stayed with her parents at a friend’s home, apparently to avoid pub-licity before leaving Iran.
Her release came when an appeals 
court reduced her eight-year prison sen-tence on charges of spying for the U.S. to a two-year suspended sentence, said Ira-nian judiciary spokesman Ali Reza Jam-shidi. He said Saberi was free to leave Iran.Journalist

Craigslist Gone Wild
Today’s question: Are you happy to 
be in Gainesville for the summer?64% YES36% NO
867 TOTAL VOTESWednesday’s question: Will you be in Gainesville for the summer?Failure of car industry falls on consumersColumn
While the mean streets 
of Gainesville often provide for hilarity 
in terms of criminal hijinks, the true epicenter of absur-
dity running rampant resides 
just a bit down the road.
Word out of Chiefland 
reveals news of a crime so ridiculous that we just knew Craigslist had to be involved.
According to an article in 
The Gainesville Sun, Chief-land police arrested a man 
pretending to be a woman of-
fering “man rubs” on Craig-slist at the rate of $200 per hour. Arthur Ramos or “Hel-en Bedd” as he was known to his customers, was charged with prostitution after police went undercover on the bul-letin board-style Web site to 
set up a “casual encounter.” 
After an exchange of $250 was made at an area hotel, an undercover agent made the arrest of Ramos.
Interestingly enough, Ra-mos conceded the fact that he was a prostitute — even go-ing as far as to rationalize his profession by claiming it was the oldest job in the world. In 
addition to the services he of-
fered in North Central Flori-da, Ramos ran a prostitution ring in Miami. 
For the Chiefland Police 
Department, the arrest of Ramos marks the first time in which the Internet played a major role in catching a 
criminal.
The Editorial Board can’t 
help but laugh hysterically 
over the plight of Ramos. At this point, we remain a bit perplexed by what exactly customers were expecting when they rendez-voused with the Craigslist hustler. 
As the ad promised “full-ser-
vice” from a female call-girl, we can only assume jaws dropped succinctly with the removal of pants to reveal Ramos as all man.With a slumping economy and a skyrocketing un-employment rate, President Barack Obama has turned to higher education with hopes of getting 
America back on track.
In an announcement made on Friday, Obama spoke of 
plans to help unemployed individuals remedy their current situations by returning to the classroom. One of the major deterrents keeping citizens from going back to school lies in the fact that unemployed individuals sacrifice their benefits if they elect to head back to a college campus. But thanks to Obama’s plan, unemployed Americans can pursue a degree while maintaining their current compensation.
Suddenly every student’s nightmare of sitting next to 
Mom during lecture has come to fruition.
According to an article on CNN.com, the Department of 
Education plans to contact colleges and universities across the country to help with the transition process. Addition-ally, Obama’s initiative will increase limits on federal Pell Grants by $500 to a maximum of $5,350 — money allocated for low-income students. News of Obama’s efforts comes in the wake of word revealing the country’s unemployment rate has hit a 25-year-high at 8.9 percent during the month of April.
The Editorial Board applauds Obama for realizing the 
value of higher education to help America turn the corner during the current economic crisis. By making it easier for unemployed people to further themselves through educa-tion, Obama has taken the steps necessary to create a work-force better suited for the ever-expanding global economy. With more individuals earning college degrees, America’s economy will transition from one relying on factory work-ers to one relying on knowledge-based skills.
I don’t like Chryslers. Or Fords. Or, for that matter, 
anything GM makes. 
I do like their old cars. The sight of a ’63 Corvette 
Sting Ray is heavenly. But I would rather avert my eyes away from the newer cars pumped out of Detroit.
It seems I’m not the only one who has had qualms 
about Pontiac’s spiderweb-like rear lights, Ford’s ugly 
interiors and Chrysler’s inflated retail prices. Ameri-
cans have been turning to foreign manufacturers to take care of their American dream for at least a decade now. Hyundai and Kia are no longer joke manufacturers, now offering cars with better mileage and quality for less than 
their American counterparts. Ford, Chevy and Dodge 
are no longer the obvious choice when it comes to pick-ing out a new truck, either. Have you seen the made-in-America Toyota Tundra lately?
Ford, GM and Chrysler haven’t been able to find the 
confidence to take a long and hard look at themselves and face the bitter fact: Their product just isn’t good enough anymore. Good is an encompassing term, by the way. Words like innovative, beautiful, valuable, efficient 
and quality all fit under the definition of a ‘good’ car.
The Europeans make good cars. The Japanese and Ko-
reans also make good cars. Sure, they got into the game 
a little late, but they’ve whipped Detroit faster than a ’70 
GTO in terms of quality, efficiency and design. Detroit 
sounded its own death knell when GM fueled the race of conspicuous consumption with the introduction of the Hummer H2, a truck whose primary market is petite blondes who can’t see over the steering wheel and men 
who have, ahem, confidence problems.
Meanwhile, everywhere else, car manufacturers fo-
cused on producing smaller and more efficient automo-biles. Even the Detroit Big Three 
were making smaller, and yes, better looking cars in Europe. But 
we didn’t want them, they said.
Our car manufacturers aren’t 
to blame. They weren’t wrong. 
We were wrong. Few people 
pined for GM’s limited produc-
tion electric car in the late 1990s and instead waited in lines for a 
chance to purchase the behemoth Ford Excursion. When the first Toyota Prius came onto the market the customer 
base consisted of those who cared so much about the en-
vironment that they scraped off their Coexist and PETA stickers from their last car as to not waste any paper. Bring on the Hummers most everyone else yelled. When 
the gas crisis hit and today’s banking and credit crisis 
appeared, the Big Three were caught with their pants down.
Now as Chrysler is reorganizing under Chapter 11 
bankruptcy, and many experts predict GM will soon 
follow, more power is being given to the United Auto 
Workers. The single institution that holds the most re-sponsibility in its own downfall by demanding inflated wages and entitlement benefits, which hinders compe-
tition between foreign automakers, will now own more 
than half of Chrysler LLC, positioning themselves to shoot off their other foot.
On the bright side, Italian automaker Fiat will now 
be charged with running the day-to-day operations. Yes, 
this is going to work out just fine.

Letter to the Editor
Obama foreign policy lacks punch
President Barack Obama is making mis-
takes impacting our foreign policy. 
The administration tried appeasement 
when it declared Hugo Chavez’s president-
for-life referendum was “for the most part… a process that was fully consistent with a democratic process.” The president warned 
North Korea it would suffer “consequences” 
if it went ahead with the launch of a long-
range missile, but North Korea snubbed the U.S. and launched the missile on a 2,000-mile run. President Obama attempted to charm Iran, but Iran’s parliament speaker rebuked 
our president and told him the U.S. has to 
acknowledge 60 years of crimes against Iran, 
change its policies and abandon Israel.
Appeasing and apologizing (for nothing) to these totalitarian countries is interpreted as groveling weakness by the administra-
tion, and it is jeopardizing our national se-
curity.

Londonderry, NH
With the honorable Justice David 
Souter’s announcement that he 
will retire from the U.S. Supreme 
Court, the cheap world of our national 
punditry has become a much more hysteri-cal place than usual — which, it should be 
noted, is a truly impressive feat. These are 
rather exciting times to be alive; it’s not ev-
ery day we get to see the ideological liberals and conservatives in our country bickering and bashing each other. Oh. Wait a minute. 
We do.
The fact of the matter is this: Souter’s de-
parture is not as big an event as the news 
media, in true Hearst fashion, want it to be. Currently the court votes largely along 
an ideologically even 4-4 split between lib-
eral and conservative judges with Kennedy 
(note: that’s Kennedy, not Souter) acting as the swing vote. Now, Souter is one of the traditionally liberal justices and President 
Barack Obama, to whom the noble task falls of nominating a replacement, is a bit of a lib-eral president — or a pinko-commie, if your 
name is Sean Hannity. 
So, that being said, is there really any 
question that Obama will appoint a left-
leaning replacement? The only question is 
which one, but whoever is chosen is going 
to look strikingly similar to the runners-up. 
The fundamental composition of the court will not change. There is nothing earth-shattering in any of this and, if not for the 
new levels of shrillness being reached by the 
pundits, I would be more excited about the 
upcoming season of Californication.
(Full disclosure: I actually am more ex-
cited about that. Watch the show.)
But, as usual, just when I’m on the verge 
of losing interest in the D.C. happenings — and about to consign myself to the joys of watching David Duchovny charm his way into yet another woman’s bed — the cries of 
our respected “punditocracy” rouse me from my naïve dreams.
It turns out that, 
when describing what 
he would look for in a potential replacement for Souter, Obama 
said something rather 
scandalous. 
He didn’t say 
that he was looking 
for someone who enjoys long walks on the 
beach and Richard Gere films — that, you 
can be sure, would have made me write a 
very different column — but the reaction is as bizarre as if he had. Obama said that he wants someone with the most terrifying of 
traits: “empathy.” You know — empathy. As 
in the ability to understand someone else’s 
feelings. Seems innocuous? Think again!
My casual monitoring of the news (three 
cheers for Google News) has taught me that 
this is not the simple, harmless — even ben-eficial — quality you might think. No, em-pathy means all sorts of wretched things, 
from a taste for ignoring the law while mak-
ing decisions to a determined agenda to redistribute wealth. I feel like we’ve finally crossed the vale and entered the Bizarro 
America that Patton Oswalt has prophesied 
for so long. 
Empathy…bad? Me no understand.
Actually, I think I do. I think what it boils 
down to is that, at this point, the right-wing 
wailers in the media are willing to get hys-
terically upset over just about anything to do 
with politics that isn’t a Palin candidacy and the mainstream news media has simply run out of things to talk about. I hope Murrow’s 
ghost haunts them all in the night.
Take away points: Souter 2.0 will be lib-
eral; I can’t stand loud people; and Califor-
nication is a brilliant show.

“In the name of love... Oprah come 
and rescue us.”  
These words were delivered in 
unison by 500 people singing and dancing 
in a gymnasium in Chicago as part of a 100 city campaign for Invisible Children.  
The next day, with those 500 people 
out in front of her studio holding up signs 
of peace, Oprah concluded that they de-
served not only her attention, but the im-mediate attention of each and every one of 
her viewers.  
On April 25, in 100 cities around the 
world, Invisible Children, an organiza-
tion dedicated to ending Africa’s longest-
running civil war in northern Uganda, 
launched a large-scale event to promote 
awareness for their cause called The Res-
cue.  
While promoting awareness of children 
who are abducted and forced to enlist into 
Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army, 
100,000 people gathered to “abduct” them-selves in demonstration until they could 
be “rescued” by a policymaker or media 
mogul.  
Invisible Children is an organization that began after three filmmakers trav-
eled to Africa and found themselves taken 
aback by the sight of children being used 
as pawns in the Ugandan civil war. From 
Australia to North America, England to South Africa, people came from every-
where to support.  
The event required people to gather at a 
designated site and then march single-file 
while holding onto a rope until they reach their “abduction site.”
They also had to bring portraits of 
themselves to the event to leave behind, along with enough supplies to last them through the time that it would take for 
their “rescuer” to arrive. Supplies also 
included pens and paper to write letters 
to their congressmen asking for more at-
tention to be paid to this issue. Most cities 
were rescued successfully within the first 
72 hours.  
In Atlanta, congressman and legendary 
civil rights figure John Lewis delivered a powerful speech applauding the partici-
pants and urging others to give more at-
tention to this issue.  
In Orange County, Calif., the band Par-amore answered 
numerous video re-
quests on YouTube 
to attend.  
In London, Lord 
Dartmouth, a mem-ber of European Par-
liament, professed, 
“There is virtually 
no better cause than Invisible Children.”  
Participants in Auckland, New Zealand, 
demanded media attention from news sta-tions before agreeing to disband from their abduction site.  
Soon, a group called the “Freedom Rid-
ers” formed, courageously traveling to af-
flicted cities after their own rescue. They 
helped to build the crowd of 500 that sat 
outside Oprah’s studio.  
Oprah embraced the demonstrators 
who had endured rainstorms, nights of 
sleeping outside and diets of pizza for days straight. On air, after answering their 
request to be rescued, she said, “You will 
be moved to take action to help rescue 
these children. It really is an atrocity, a holocaust, going on with these children… This is a special situation that I think the 
world needs to know about.”
Other celebrities like Kristen Bell, Joel 
Madden, Kirsten Dunst, Pete Wentz and Jeff Foxworthy took part in the event to 
draw the attention of many local and na-
tional news stations. But no media outlet 
was more successful than the airtime giv-
en to the 500 people outside Oprah’s stu-dio on May 1.  
In the end, over 100,000 people gathered 
themselves to share their voice about their stance concerning atrocities hundreds of miles away. 
With all the exposure and the simplic-
ity of the message — stopping the war in 
Uganda and the abduction of children –– 
many were touched by the acts of those 
participating in The Rescue.  
Hats off to the Invisible Children or-
ganization and to those brave enough to 
participate who used their time toward promoting the protection of basic human 
rights.

The No. 1 Gators softball team celebrates its second straight SEC Tournament title after an 8-5 victory against 
the Crimson Tide on Saturday in Knoxville, Tenn. UF came back from an early deficit to take home the trophy.
� UF ENTERS NCAAs AS 
NO. 1 OVERALL SEED.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — 
Even Mother Nature couldn’t 
stop the Gators’ march to-
ward a second straight South-eastern Conference Tourna-ment Championship.
Saturday’s title game be-
tween No. 1 UF (55-3) and No. 5 Alabama (47-9) was delayed for an hour and a half due to rain, but a first-inning grand slam by shortstop Megan Bush put the Gators ahead by 3. The Crimson Tide rallied late, but the Gators prevailed 8-5 at Lee Softball Stadium in Knoxville, Tenn.
“To repeat as tournament 
champions and SEC cham-pions is probably one of the hardest things that we’ve ac-complished in my coaching career, playing with the bur-den of being the No. 1 team and the target and all those things,” UF coach Tim Wal-
ton said.
The Gators have worked 
all season to manage the ex-
pectations and demands that come with being the top-
ranked team in the nation. 
Saturday, they had to work 
just to get a strike called.
UF pitcher Stacey Nelson 
(35-3, 0.43 ERA) and Ala-
bama’s Kelsi Dunne (24-3, 
1.45) struggled to find the 
strike zone early. As a result, 
the first inning and a half lasted an hour, and Nelson 
and Dunne combined for four 
walks and three hit batters as 
they tried to work the inside 
corner, the only place either one could get a called strike.
“I don’t think I would have 
wanted to be a pitcher today,” 
Alabama catcher Ashley Hol-
combe said. “Sometimes you Gators repeat as 
champs vs. Tide

Jo Mather had only enough 
time to give a fist pump before be-
ing swarmed by the rest of the No. 15 UF women’s tennis team after a 4-2 win against Florida State. 
The freshman clinched the 
match against the No. 18 Semi-noles with a forehand that sent the ball skidding down the sideline past an out-of-position Lauren Macfarlane and earned  the Gators a Sweet 16 berth in the NCAA Tennis Championships.
The UF men will not be joining 
their female counterparts, howev-er, after falling 4-3 to No. 22 Miami in a second-round match on Sat-urday. No. 10 UF (18-9) downed Marist 4-0 on Friday and took a 3-0 lead against Miami (16-8) but was unable to get the clinching point.The women’s second-round 
match on Sunday was also a  roll-ercoaster but with a happier out-come for the Gators. The match started similar to UF’s 4-1 first-round win against Charleston as  
Florida State struck first in doubles on Court 3, put-
ting pressure 
on courts 1 and 2.
After Mather and Marrit Boon-
stra defeated Federica Suess and Katie Rybakova, the doubles point was in the hands of Jessica Alex-ander and Anastasia Revzina. The No. 25 tandem was down 3-2 ear-
ly but bounced back to clinch the 
doubles point with an 8-4 victory on a double fault.

It’s only been 19 days since 
the end of spring classes, but UF 
sports teams have been plenty busy during the intermission.
BASE HEATS UP:  The UF base-
ball team has found its stride despite losing two of three at LSU this weekend. The Gators won eight games in a row from April 21 to May 3, including a sweep of last year’s national runner-up Georgia in Athens. Taking three from the Bulldogs vaulted UF into first place in the Southeastern Conference East Division, and the Gators cur-rently hold a two-game lead.
UF will play its final non-
conference game tonight when it 
hosts Jacksonville before finish-
ing its SEC slate with a home se-ries Thursday through Saturday against Kentucky. The Gators have clinched one of the eight berths in the SEC Tournament. 
Division winners are guar-
anteed the top two seeds, while 
the other six are determined by 
record.
TYUS STAYING 
AT UF:  Gators 
s o p h o m o r e 
forward Alex 
Tyus will be 
staying in 
G a i n e s v i l l e 
after all. 
The school released a statement 
regarding his decision on April 
28, 10 days after he initially de-
clared his plans to go to another 
school.    
“It’s great to know that his 
heart is here at the University of 
Florida,” coach Billy Donovan said in a statement.THREE GATORS TAKEN IN NFL 
DRAFT: UF continued its streak 
of having a player selected in the 
first round for the third straight 
year when wide receiver Percy 
Harvin was drafted No. 22 by 
the Vikings. The Raiders draft-
ed wide receiver Louis Murphy 
in the fourth round with the 
124th overall selection. Tight 
end Cornelius Ingram went to 
the Eagles in the fifth round 
with the 153rd overall pick.
Offensive linemen Phil 
Trautwein and Jason Watkins, running back Kestahn Moore 
and long snapper James Smith 
signed free-agent contracts after 
the NFL Draft. 
Trautwein went to the Rams, 
and Watkins went to the Tex-ans. The Broncos picked up 
Moore while Smith went to the 
Bengals.UF SPORTS ROUNDUPWhat you may have missed...

The UF women’s golf season 
came to a disappointing end this 
weekend and took another turn Monday night when coach Jill Briles-Hinton announced her resignation.
The Gators did not qualify for the 
NCAA Championships after finish-ing in 16th place at the NCAA East 
Regional on their home course this 
past weekend.
They won one SEC title during 
her 11 years at the helm and ad-vanced to the NCAA Champion-
ships only six times.
“Our vision is that the women’s 
golf team is consistently among the 
contenders at the NCAA Champi-onships,” UF athletics director Jer-emy Foley said in a statement. “That simply hasn’t happened, and now we begin a search for a coach that shares that vision.”
Last year’s East Regional cham-
pions fell far short of qualifying this year, shooting 68 over par to finish in 16th out of 21 teams. 
It finished 19 strokes behind the 
final qualifier, eighth-place Georgia (49 over).
The disappointing end came after a consistent season of top-10 finishes and was perhaps even more surpris-ing due to its being on Gainesville’s Mark Bostick Golf Course.
“The program is better off than 
when I started, but I feel it is time to step aside and let someone else take it from here,” said Briles-Hin-ton, 2008 Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year, in a statement. “I enjoyed my time at Florida, and now I’m looking forward to spend-ing time with my family. 
“I hope to get back into coaching 
someday and look forward to again helping young golfers achieve their dreams.”
The advantage of playing at home 
did not help as much as expected. Sophomore Jessica Yadloczky, who finished in the top 10 as an individu-al in the last five tournaments, could 
not keep her streak going. 
After an uncharacteristic finish 
of 76th place with a score of 22 over 
par, Yadloczky summarized the team’s performance in two words. 
“We sucked.” Yadloczky attributed her poor 
performance to the excessive amount of pressure she put on herself. 
“I wanted it way too bad, and it 
got in my way,” she said. “I guess I’m learning the hard way — you can’t want it this bad.” 
While disappointed, the sopho-
more found some positive things to carry into next season. “We gained team bonding,” she 
said. “We all came from different places, and we got to know each other and learned how to work to-gether as a team this year.” With the entire team returning 
next season, the disappointing end to this season will leave a sour taste in the Gators’ mouth that will mo-tivate them that much more for the 2009-10 season. 
“This puts fire in our bellies, and 
this makes us work that much hard-er for next season,” Yadloczky said.TUESDAY, MAY 12, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Coach resigns after UF fails to qualify for NCAAs

The Seminole Twilight Invita-
tional in Tallahassee proved to be 
just what UF needed this weekend 
as the Gators prepare for the up-
coming Southeastern Conference Outdoor Championships.
The Gators walked away with 
four event wins and 11 NCAA re-gional-qualifying marks. The team managed to go out and accom-plish exactly what it set out to do — make improvements before the 
important championship stretch.
UF coach Mike Holloway be-
lieves his team’s performance will 
carry over as momentum into the upcoming SEC meet.
“I’ve felt good about this group 
all year long. The big thing is ev-erybody here trusts each other (and) believes in each other,” Hol-
loway said.  “We all have the same 
focus and the same vision, and that produces great results.”
This weekend’s standouts in-
cluded some usual names as well as some new ones. 
Kemal Mesic, who competed 
in his first collegiate discus com-petition Friday, threw the ninth-
best distance in UF history with 
a regional-qualifying toss of 186-7/56.88m. The sophomore from Sarajevo, Bosnia, placed second in the men’s discus and the men’s shot put events.
Freshmen Ben Davies and Mi-
chael Anderson were responsible for UF’s two event victories on Fri-day. Davies captured the first win during the men’s javelin, followed by Anderson’s first-place finish in the steeplechase.
N a t a l i e 
Moser won the women’s 
pole vault 
with a NCAA regional-quali-fying leap of 13-1.50/4.00m. 
On Satur-
day, junior 
Mariam Kevkhishvili won the women’s shot put after defeating 
seven other women. Winning the 
shot put is nothing new for Kev-khishvili, who is the 2009 NCAA Indoor Shot Put Champion.
As the Gators gear up for the 
SEC Outdoor Championships this week, Holloway doubts practice for this meet will be any different than preparation for earlier meets this season.
“We need to continue to stay 
focused and stay on task,” Hollo-way said. “Having our friends and family here for support during the meet will be great.”Track teams hitting

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — At 
the Southeastern Confer-
ence Tournament, the Gators 
were put in a situation they 
have rarely faced: having to come from behind early in the game.
After posting a shutout in 
its 3-0 first-round win against Auburn on Thursday, UF al-lowed Tennessee to put up 3 quick runs on two hits and a 
costly error by shortstop Me-
gan Bush on the first at-bat of Friday’s game.
But the Gators relied on 
their bats to put them back in 
the game, and the top of the 
lineup responded. 
Second baseman Aja Pacul-
ba ripped a double to center, moved to third on a ground-
out by Kristina Hilberth and 
scored on Ali Gardiner’s 2-run homer to left field.
“We learned something 
about our team tonight. No matter what the score is, we can come back from it,” UF coach Tim Walton said after 
defeating the Volunteers. “We 
fought well. I think Aja actu-ally cracked a smile and fist-pumped for the first time in 
her career. 
“I really took it as a posi-tive. We got fired up and an-
swered.”
By the end of the inning, the 
Gators were up 4-3, and they 
never looked back. UF scored 
4 more runs in the second on back-to-back-to-back home runs and added 1 in each of 
the final three innings before 
mercy-ruling Tennessee 11-3. 
“That’s just what our team 
is like. They scored 3, and we just wanted to answer back so they know they can’t hang around with us,” left fielder 
Francesca Enea said. “It’s 
what we’re going to do. We’re going to score runs and give our pitchers as much support as possible. 
“That’s the type of team we 
are.”
UF found itself in a simi-
lar situation the next day 
in Saturday’s tournament 
championship game against Alabama. The Crimson Tide scored 2 runs in the first, load-ing the bases on a single and two walks by Stacey Nelson.
Nelson hit Alabama catcher 
Ashley Holcombe to bring in 
the first run of the game. Char-
lotte Morgan crossed the plate for the Tide on a wild pitch by Nelson to put the Gators in a 
2-0 hole.
“Alabama did a good job 
capitalizing on a few breaks 
for them,” Hilberth said. “We just need to do a better job of 
shutting our opponents down 
in the first inning.”
The Gators once again 
bounced back and regained 
the lead thanks to a grand 
slam by Bush, putting them ahead 5-2. Although Alabama rallied late, UF held on to se-cure the victory.
Walton praised his team’s 
ability to come back from an early deficit two days in a row after not facing such a chal-lenge nearly all season. 
He attributed the team’s 
composure to its 6 a.m. work-outs on “Gator Mountain,” referring to the stadium steps 
the team runs in the fall.
“You think you’re done, 
then you do another one. 
Then you do another one and 
another one. It’s where you 
get composure, where you get your guts from,” he said. “That builds a lot more charac-ter than most people think.”UF SOFTBALL

just feel like you don’t know what you have 
to do to get a strike called. But we had the same situation in the first inning — bases loaded with one out — and they hit the 
grand slam and we didn’t.”
Bush benefited from the inside pitching 
in the bottom of the first, as her bases-load-
ed shot to left field came on the 16th pitch 
of the at-bat.
“She pitched me inside the whole time, so 
I was just trying to battle and foul off, then I 
got one that I could drive,” Bush said.
The Gators added to their lead in the fourth on a sacrifice bunt by Tiffany DeFe-lice and a double by Kelsey Bruder, who had three RBIs on the day. 
Alabama responded in the top of the 
fifth, as Charlotte Morgan, the SEC Player of the Year, took a screwball from Nelson over the scoreboard in left-center field.
The home run was the first of the season 
allowed by the two-time SEC Pitcher of the 
Year. 
Dating back to last season, it had been 
254 innings and nearly 900 at-bats since 
Nelson last gave up a homer.
“Playing in Division-I college softball, 
home runs are kind of inevitable, especially 
to hitters like Charlotte Morgan who can drive the ball well,” Nelson said. “I wasn’t 
really thinking about it, but it happens.”
The Gators had four players on the SEC 
All-Tournament Team, including catcher 
Kristina Hilberth, who was named the tour-
nament’s MVP. Bruder, third baseman Cor-rie Brooks and second baseman Aja Paculba joined Hilberth.
Nelson said her teammate was “long 
overdue” for such an award. Walton added that Hilberth, a senior who has never made 
an All-SEC team, could not have been more 
deserving of the award.
“Without Kristina Hilberth, this team 
doesn’t function. She’s a leader. I’ve chal-lenged her all year to be a leader. She leads, 
she blocks, she throws, she hits,” Walton 
said. “That’s a reward right there for a kid who’s fought through the most adversity 
you can face as an athlete – not being very 
good to being named SEC Tournament 
MVP your senior season on the No. 1 team 
in the country.”Senior catcher wins MVP to lead four Gators on All-Tournament Team
ting a precedent, kept giving our 
presence at the net and on the base-line, that they would break down,” Alexander said.
The Seminoles countered with a 
quick singles win, evening the score on Court 6, but Alexander put the Gators ahead and No. 8 Boonstra overcame a shaky start to beat Ryba-kova 1-6, 6-2, 6-1.
“(In the first set) I just didn’t feel 
the ball, and she hits really hard, so I didn’t really play my own game,” Boonstra said. “The second set I just told myself, ‘Keep the ball in play and try to get a rhythm.’ It worked out good.”
Florida State answered again 
with a win in No. 2 singles, and at 3-2, it was up to Mather or Barbara Pinterova to capture the ticket to College Station, Texas, home to the remainder of the team champion-
ships. 
Pinterova, who won her first set 
6-2, lost a second-set tiebreaker 6-7 
(3), forcing a third set that never be-gan because Mather had clinched the match.
Mather was admittedly nervous 
going into her first singles set against Macfarlane, who beat Mather in February. 
She lost her first set 6-2 but broke 
M a c f a r l a n e ’ s serve en route to a 6-4 second-set victory. 
“I really just 
wanted to beat 
her,” Mather said. “I came out and all I could think about was 
the end result of the match. After the first set, (assistant coach) Dave (Ba-logh) came over and said, ‘Breathe and relax.’”With that advice, Mather won 
the deciding set 6-3. 
UF coach Roland Thornqvist said 
he couldn’t be more proud of his first-year players — Mather, Alex-ander and Pinterova.
“Well, the freshmen — you can’t 
call them freshmen anymore now — the good thing with this year was 
they all had to play,” Thornqvist 
said. “They all had to play a lot. The bad thing is they had to play through some injuries.  
“There were certainly times dur-
ing the year where the youngsters in particular could have lost confidence because they weren’t playing at the optimal time, but all three of them showed they were tough enough to pull a comeback.”
The Gators found even more mo-
tivation in a Seminoles team blog that had Linder Stadium as a pit stop to the Sweet 16.
“Certainly, they beat us two 
months ago, but we’ve won 67 
straight matches at home and, frank-
ly, beaten much better teams than the one we played today during the streak,” Thornqvist said. “Maybe it gave us a little bit of an edge know-ing that they simply had Gainesville as a stopping point on their way to College Station.”
