Despite hard freezes and a frost lasting 
early this morning, Gainesville is expected to 
warm up by the weekend.
Though temperatures will drop to 36 de-
grees tonight, they will reach the mid-70s Sat-urday, said Chuck Caracozza, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Miami. 
Because temperatures reached the low 20s this week, Gainesville Regional Utilities 
advised customers to take precautions — re-
minders that will remain in effect throughout the approaching winter.
People should cover their plants, bring 
pets inside and bundle up, said Michael Mc-Cabe, GRU energy conservation specialist. Residents should also keep a steady drizzle of water ﬂ  owing from faucets in order to pre-vent pipes from freezing.He suggested setting heaters to 68 degrees 
on cold days to keep down utility bills, as they increase by about 4 percent for each de-gree higher thermostats are set.
“It’s just a recommended setting for com-fort and energy savings,” McCabe said. 
A broken insulator took out trafﬁ  c lights 
along Newberry Road shortly after 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, said GRU spokeswoman Kend-all Litton Jensen.
The chilly morning air was just one reason 
the insulator’s conductor contracted, causing the outage.
“It was a perfect storm of conditions to-
day,” she said. Don’t worry: Cold front won’t last long, experts say
� THE VOTE WILL REMAIN ON THE DEC. 3 AGENDA.

Student senators at Santa Fe College spent nearly four hours 
Wednesday debating nearly everything but the impeachment of 
its Senate president.
The Senate voted 24-22 last week to make Jeremy Pierce’s im-
peachment possible. But by the time it decided the order of agen-
da items and addressed questions, there weren’t enough senators 
remaining in the room to vote on sending Pierce to trial.
Several senators left the room during a second roll call at 7:30 
p.m., said Senate Secretary Kelly Cooper, which decreased the number of present members below the minimum 44 required to conduct business.
Without enough members to vote, the decision of whether to 
send Pierce to trial for violations of Student Government law and the code of ethics was not addressed. The vote will remain on the 
Senate agenda for its Dec. 3 session.
If the majority had voted for the impeachment, the decision 
would have been the ﬁ  rst step in Pierce facing a trial, said Dalton 
King, Senate pro tempore.
“We’re just approving the resolution,” King said.Some members of Senate were confused about the wording of SFC Student Senate

Alachua County became the 
ﬁ  rst county in North Florida to 
publicly support marriage equal-ity this week.
The County Commission signed 
an amicus curiae brief Tuesday de-nouncing the state same-sex mar-riage ban, joining cities like Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Tallahassee.
The brief acts as a friend-of-
the-court statement, ﬁ  led indepen-dently of parties involved in the litigation process.
The court can then decide whether to refer to the brief Ala-chua signed, which outlines the legal, ﬁ  nancial and psychological 
harm its signees believe the state 
ban inﬂ  icts on same-sex couples.
The brief also cites a study that 
suggests being an LGBT-friendly workplace increases the produc-tivity of LGBT employees and also improves their professional rela-tionships — a positive effect for state employers, the brief implies.
The City of Gainesville signed 
onto the brief in October, accord-ing to an Equality Florida news 
release.
“The Alachua County Com-
mission stood up and did the right 
thing,” said Terry Fleming, co-president of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida.
Fleming said he hopes the coun-
ty’s position will persuade judges to recognize the rights of same-sex couples and believes more cities and counties will soon follow in Alachua’s footsteps.
“It’s important that folks stand 
up and take a position on marriage equality,” he said.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3
� 1,900 STUDENTS EVACUATED.
MELISSA MIHM
Alligator Staff Writer mmihm@alligator.org
For about three hours, Gainesville High 
School students stood in the cold and waited 
while officers and four canines swept cam-pus for explosives.
“Bomb threat,” an anonymous caller said 
to a school secretary Wednesday, who im-mediately reported the call to Gainesville Police just after noon.
School officials said the caller sounded 
like a teenager, police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
Teachers, staff and about 1,900 students 
were evacuated.
Parents stood in a zigzagged line at the Plaza Verde Shopping Center, waiting to pick up their children from Planet Fitness. Huddled in sweaters and coats, they tex-ted students and reminded others to stay in 
line.
Tony Reddick, 54, was waiting at about 2 
p.m. to pick up his daughter, Raven.
“Hopefully it’s a prank,” he said as he 
twirled a red lollipop between his fingers. “Unfortunately, there are people in this 
world that do this kind of stuff.”
Reddick said the school did not contact 
the parents directly. Instead, his daughter contacted him and his wife.
The school was cleared out after 3:30 p.m. 
Tobias said although officers investigated the threat, they had not identified a suspect. 
He couldn’t recall the last time the high 
school faced a bomb threat.Bomb threat evacuates GHSRANKINGS

The UF MBA program at the Hough 
Graduate School of Business was ranked 
No. 24 among the nation’s full-time public programs by Bloomberg Businessweek.
In Bloomberg’s “2014 Best U.S. Busi-
ness Schools,” UF was the only full-time program from the state of Florida, landing a spot at 48th overall among both public and private programs.
Yiming Wang, a student assistant at 
the Hough Graduate School of Business, wrote in an email that the business admin-istration team admits the smartest candi-dates and helps students widen their con-
nections during their two MBA years.
“Because of the hard working of the 
administration team, we make it easier to 
help find dream jobs,” Wang said. “That is the most important thing for MBA candi-dates: finding a future career.”
UF’s $26,264 cost is the least expensive 
among the top 25 public programs in the nation, according to the Warrington Col-
lege of Business Administration website.
Bloomberg ranked the programs based 
on three criteria: a survey of student sat-
isfaction, a survey of employees who hire graduates and faculty strength measured by research in esteemed journals.
“It (the ranking) makes me feel like I’m 
on the right track at the University of Flor-ida,”  said Erica Neumark, a 19-year-old 
business managment sophomore. UF business program No. 24

From left, SFC SG parliamentarian Andy Alvarez, Student Senate President Jeremy Pierce, 
Senate Pro Tempore Dalton King and Senate Secretary Kelly Cooper preside over Pierce’s impeachment along with other issues, at the SFC Student Senate meeting Wednesday.
Too few members at the meeting caused the delay of vote
the resolution and the amount of evidence 
included in its ﬁ  ve articles stating allega-tions against Pierce.
Santa Fe philosophy sophomore Wal-
lace Mazon said the articles of impeach-
ment were legitimate.
“We got it straight off of Clinton’s,” the 
20-year-old said, referencing President Bill 
Clinton’s impeachment proceedings.
But before the Senate could stop an-
swering questions and instead move to dis-cussion — after which the trial vote would have taken place — senators debated about the amount of time each person could have 
to speak on the issue.
“This is an important matter,” a sena-
tor said. “I move to give anyone unlimited speaking time.”
Sen. Bailey Erickson, a Santa Fe dual-en-
rolled freshman, instead made a movement 
to create a four-minute speech limit but still allow unlimited speeches.
“I agree that this is a sensitive subject, 
but we’ll be here all night,” the 17-year-old said. “I think four minutes will give everyone ample speaking time, and I hope we’re all mature enough not to beat a dead horse.”
Pierce objected and then asked for an 
uninterrupted 10 minutes to defend him-self.
“I ﬁ  nd that to be pretty reasonable,” he 
said. “You’re going to give me just four minutes to defend myself?”
But Santa Fe criminal justice sophomore 
Sen. Benjamin Myers, 19, said that was un-necessary.
“There’s a place and time for the de-
fense,” said Myers, the Student Body inter-nal affairs director. “That’s called trial.”
But some senators rebutted, suggesting 
he deserved extra speaking time. Others re-quested to see the evidence stacked against Pierce. However, the information will not be released until the would-be trial because 
of the Family Educational Rights and Pri-
vacy Act.
“We don’t want to wait for the trial to 
go through all the evidence — I certainly brought mine,” Pierce said, referring to the 200 documents he said he brought to prove his innocence.
After the meeting, Pierce said Wednes-
day’s debate was vigorous but ensured ev-erything was true, fair and transparent.
“I’m certainly glad to keep my gavel,” 
Pierce said. “Even for two more weeks.”SANTA FE , from page 1ADMINISTRATION

UF is looking to ﬁ  ll one Board of Trustees spot as the 
application deadline was extended.
The Florida Board of Governors extended the applica-
tion deadline for the 22 Board of Trustee positions through-
out the State University System of Florida until Dec. 17.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said a new seat will open 
in January, but the Board of Governors is soliciting for ap-
plicants now.
Carolyn Roberts will be leaving her position, Sikes said. 
Roberts is a UF research foundation board of directors 
member.
Her seat expires Jan. 6.Roberts was appointed by the Board of Governors to 
serve UF’s Board of Trustees in 2010.
“She also could be reappointed,” Sikes said.  Of the 10 applicants that have applied for the seat, Rob-
erts is one of them, said Brittany Davis, Board of Governors 
communication director.
Applicants are not required to live in Florida to serve, 
but all the new applicants reside in Florida.
The new elected member will have a term running from 
Jan. 6, 2015 to Jan. 6, 2020.
“The Board is accepting applications for 22 vacancies 
throughout the State University System, and has extended 
the deadline to attract the best possible ﬁ  eld of candidates,”  Davis wrote in an email.Application deadline extended for one UF Board of Trustees spot

A U.S. AGENCY.

UF faculty and students will trav-
el across eight countries as part of a 
project to empower female farmers.
The university will receive $1.5 
million of a $7 million grant from 
the U.S. Agency for International 
Development to kick-start the gen-der initiative.  
The Integrating Gender and Nu-trition within Agricultural Exten-
sion Services project will be divided 
among the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of California, Davis and consultancy firm Cultural Practice, LLC.
The project was created to 
strengthen gender and nutrition in-tegration through agricultural out-reach, reduce poverty and malnutri-
tion and increase food security.
“We’ll be doing several things 
over there,” said Sandra Russo, di-
rector of the UF International Cen-ter’s Program Development unit and the project’s principal investiga-tor. “It includes a lot of training for 
farmers and training for the people 
working to help them. We’ll also be doing research on those countries.”
Russo said the university was in-
terested in the program.
“We’ve been a part of the consor-
tium for five or six years,” she said. “One university does not have all the resources they need, so everyone in-
volved pulls together their resources 
and helps each other.”
While the program is geared to-
ward women, the program will as-sist both men and women in learn-ing about each other’s roles in a social system.
“You can train women all you 
want on nutrition but if you don’t train men, it won’t work,” Russo said.
The project and university groups 
will focus on four countries for 15 months, beginning in January, and will revise the program as needed for the other four countries.
Kathleen Colverson, associate di-
rector of International Programs in UF’s College of Agriculture, said the countries benefiting from the project will be announced within the next week. They will be selected from the Feed the Future Initiative, a govern-
ment effort to stop global hunger 
and malnutrition.
Juandavid Orejuela, a UF food 
and resource economics junior, said it’s great that UF is partnering with universities to help countries in need of developing a nutritional system.
“Usually, women in those coun-
tries farm and the men sell their 
products,” the 20-year-old said. 
“But it’s also important for women to know how to sell and for men to know how to plant and grow food. There needs to be that gender equal-ity in those countries.”

Students for a Democratic Society mem-
bers held a banner on Turlington Plaza 
calling for UF to demilitarize Wednesday.
Students held signs emblazoned with 
“Our campus is not a war zone” and 
“Schools don’t need soldiers” at the rally.  
The group was protesting UF’s participa-tion in the Defense Department’s Excess Property program, also known as the 1033, a federal program that provides military-grade weapons to police forces.  
The group handed out informational 
brochures and asked for student signa-tures to petition for UF to opt out of the program. The organization hopes to obtain 1,500 signatures for the petition.
Jonathan Waring, the organization’s 
president, spoke briefly at the rally. War-ing, a 20-year-old UF Jewish studies sopho-more, said the group does not believe Uni-
versity Police should have military-grade weapons. He said the program has been so controversial that the federal government 
has ordered an investigation of it.
“I really don’t think it’s in the public 
consciousness yet,” he said. “But I think if people do know about the program, they probably don’t know about the extent to which it reaches into our lives.”  
About 66 institutions have M16 assault 
rifles from the 1033 program, according to 
The New York Times.
Waring said the organization became 
interested in the issue after the protests in 
Ferguson, Missouri. Waring said if its fight is successful on campus, the organization plans to tackle the issue at the city level. 
The rally ended with the crowd chant-
ing “opt out now” led by members of Stu-dents for a Democratic Society.
Tristan Worthington, a 19-year-old UF 
English sophomore, is a lead organizer for the group.  Worthington said the organi-zation hopes to raise awareness and help pressure the administration to opt out of the program.
“All across the nation we are experienc-
ing and witnessing police brutality,” she said. “And it’s very unnerving, especially 
as students and activists who believe that 
we should make our voices heard and fight for the rights of our community.”Student organization rallies

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgWednesday’s question: Should e-ciga-
rettes be regulated?Today’s question: Are you cold?Uber’s ﬂ  ippant attitude disconcerting
The year 2014 has seen dozens of deﬁ  nitive moments — 
particularly those in technology — that will no doubt set the tone for the rest of the century.
The driving force behind changes of this scale is new 
developments in technology. While technology no doubt 
creates progress, people often stagger in catching up to the 
advances.
One ﬁ  ne example of this sort of innovation is Uber, a so-
called ride-sharing company that provides an excellent ser-vice but has come under ﬁ  re for multiple shady dealings.
Uber’s genius lies in the fact that it is remarkably easy, 
convenient and cheaper than its closest substitute: taxis. 
“Everyone’s private driver” is ludicrously convenient and 
much sexier than similar enterprises. From the consumer’s 
point of view, Uber is freakin’ brilliant. But consumers aren’t 
the only people involved in these transactions.
See, Uber makes its physical and philosophical home in 
the land of Silicon Valley, a swath of California that Ayn Rand would literally kill for an opportunity to inhabit. Sili-con Valley — where Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netﬂ  ix also reside — is a techno-libertarian paradise. Here, the market is truly free — mostly because the technology these companies are built on is, at most, 15 years old, and no-
body knows how to regulate it. Innovation is fueled by ﬁ  erce 
competition between these companies, which are locked in a constant struggle to generate and acquire absolutely aston-ishing amounts of capital.
It was from this sleek, state-of-the-art, ruthlessly competi-
tive world that Uber was born. And it is this worldview that it maintains.
Uber has garnered massive amounts of criticism. Much of 
this comes from governments as well as Uber’s own drivers. 
Uber undermines taxi regulations, which is why it’s called a 
ride-sharing service instead of a taxi service. Legally, Uber is just an app that connects people who need to be driven places and people willing to drive them. However, the fact that the ﬁ  nancial transactions are done in-app kind of defeats that claim. The money goes to Uber ﬁ  rst — drivers get about 20 percent.
Uber also treats its drivers like crap. Driver protests have erupted, and there’s an entire on-line forum dedicated to drivers venting about mistreatment from the company and entitled drunk millennials. Drivers depend on 
Uber’s ﬁ  ve-star rating system for 
employment. They are expected to maintain at least a 4.7 average, or they’ll get ﬁ  red.
But two of this week’s head-
lines made Uber’s attitude a whole lot more clear. Spotify, after it was dumped by Taylor Swift two weeks ago, recently announced that it’s getting together with Uber. If you have Spotify Premium (the paid version), you can stream your 
music from the speakers on your next Uber ride.
Although that sounds dandy, drivers and other activ-
ists noticed it seems poorly thought out. What if the driver 
doesn’t have streaming capability and is given a career-end-ing, one-star review? It’s not safe for anybody to drive while “Just A Friend” is blaring in his or her car and the volume is controlled by someone who’s been slamming sea breezes for the last ﬁ  ve hours.
But we saw Uber’s upper management slide from irre-
sponsible to downright creepy when Buzzfeed published a story about remarks made by Emil Michael, a senior Uber executive, at a New York City dinner party. When discus-sion moved toward some of Uber’s negative press attention, Michael publicly thought out loud about hiring a team of re-searchers who would investigate journalists critical of Uber. These researchers would dig into “your personal lives, your families,” coming up with something juicy and scandalous to throw back at critics.
Uber has since distanced itself from this fantastic public 
relations blunder, but the fact that one of its top executives thought this was appropriate to say out loud in public, even if he was joking, is disconcerting. Along with previous ques-tionable behavior, this points to the company leadership’s reckless disregard for anything but its own advancement.

wrong to oppose 
NSA reform bill
On Tuesday evening, the U.S. Senate held a vote on a bill that would have curtailed the extensive and likely un-constitutional data collection programs of the National 
Security Agency.
The bill would have placed restrictions on the NSA’s once-
secret phone surveillance program, which “collects records of Americans’ phone calls in bulk,” according to The New York Times. The bill received 58 votes in favor and 41 against — a clear majority but not enough to overcome the Senate’s arcane and abused cloture rules, which require 60 “yes” votes to avoid a ﬁ  libuster. Both of Florida’s senators, Marco Rubio and Bill Nel-son voted against the reform bill. Nelson was the sole Democrat to vote with 40 Republicans against the bill’s passage.
Rubio’s opposition to NSA reform is hardly surprising. Last 
year, Rubio suggested that NSA programs are necessary to pro-tect ordinary Americans from the threat of Islamic terrorism.
“The threat that we face — largely radical, political Islamists 
— is probably a threat that is going to exist for the rest of our lifetimes. It’s just the reality. We have to deal with it,” Rubio told the Tampa Bay Times.
Apparently, in Rubio’s mind, dealing with it means funding 
a massive national security state that violates Fourth Amend-ment rights of innocent Americans on a regular and indiscrimi-
nate basis. He justiﬁ  ed his opposition to the reform bill by say-
ing that it would “weaken our ability to protect Americans by severely degrading our ability to identify and disrupt terrorists plots against the U.S. and our allies.”
Rubio’s statement contradicts a number of reports, including 
one from the New America Foundation and a separate study commissioned by the White House, which found that the NSA surveillance program “was not essential to preventing attacks.”
Nelson’s vote against NSA reform, while deeply disappoint-
ing, is also not surprising given his previous favorable state-ments on the surveillance programs. Last year, Nelson wrote an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel describing the NSA’s data col-lection techniques as necessary weapons in an “evolving-global battle against a shadowy enemy determined to harm us.”
He described the surrender of Americans’ constitutional 
rights and personal freedoms as “sacriﬁ  ces to strengthen our na-tion’s security.”
Nelson’s fear mongering on this issue is simply despicable, 
and his assertion that the NSA spying on ordinary Americans improves national security is deeply misguided. He had an opportunity to stand with the rest of the Democratic Party in support of the Constitution and rights of ordinary Americans by voting for the NSA reform bill. Instead, he chose to embrace unnecessary and unconstitutional programs that are justiﬁ  ed through baseless scare tactics.
Floridians deserve senators who stand up for their civil liber-
ties and constitutional rights. Hopefully, Nelson and Rubio will 
make more thoughtful decisions about the NSA’s surveillance 
programs if the issue resurfaces.THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2014

UF’s annual African dance per-
formance is returning to campus.
The College of the Arts and the 
School of Theatre and Dance will 
host the 20th Agbedidi African 
dance at the Constans Theatre from  
today through Sunday. Tickets are $17 for the general public and $13 for students.
The performance is a semester’s 
worth of work for students learning West African dance and culture. All dance majors have to take Agbedidi once. There are no prerequisites for 
the class, but 75 percent of the danc-
ers are dance majors.
It’s a great opportunity to be ex-
posed to people from many differ-ent backgrounds and get perspec-tive as an American artist, said UF alumnus Larry Rosalez Lewis, the director’s assistant.
Agbedidi showcases not just 
West African dance styles but con-temporary and modern styles as well. It covers a wide range of top-ics and emotions, from the feeling of being racially proﬁ  led to the joys of true happiness.
Although all the pieces get cho-
reographed separately, there is a central storyline about migration and movement connecting the dances in the performance.
Each show is a different experi-
ence, and every year there is a new 
story to tell.
Mohamed DaCosta, originally 
from Guinea, is directing the show. 
He has been teaching West African dance and directing the annual per-formance since 2003.
Most schools don’t have many 
opportunities to learn about Afri-can culture, he said, and UF is one 
of only 10 colleges in the country 
that has any course like this.
Precious Roberts, a 23-year-old 
UF dance junior, said she has prac-ticed West African dance styles since she was 12, and this is her sec-ond time performing in Agbedidi. She said she sees DaCosta as a men-tor.
The show incorporates dance, 
music and acting for an interactive experience that is high tempo and fast paced, DaCosta said. Perform-ers invite audience members to join on stage and become a part of the show.
The biggest goal of the perfor-
mance is to invite people of all eth-
nicities to look at cultures different 
from their own.
“It’s not just seeing it,” DaCosta 
said. “You’re part of it.”

Aspiring Gainesville artists and poets 
kicked off Mellow Soul Tuesdays’ ﬁ  rst 
open mic night at Rockeys Dueling Piano Bar this week.
The event, which featured singing, spo-
ken word poetry, monologues, musicians and a live artist who created pieces on stage throughout the evening, was inspired by founder Ashley Wal-lace’s vision to revitalize the arts scene in down-town Gainesville. About 50 people attended.
“We’re just trying to bring some culture out — 
just give local artists or poets a platform to per-form again,” said Wallace, a 26-year-old donor scheduler at LifeSouth Community Blood Center.
Wallace reached out to smooth jazz and rhythm 
and blues singer Phillip “Jazz Dad” Thomas to be the spotlight performer during the evening’s solo sessions. 
Thomas is a Gainesville local who has per-
formed throughout the U.S. and said he discov-ered his passion for singing at age 4 in Gaines-ville’s Church of God By Faith choir.
He said he wanted to perform at the event “to 
inspire the upcoming artists to be able to take the stage and get rid of stage fright and push their talent past Gainesville.”
One of those upcoming artists, Nehemi-
ah Nash, opened the event with a spoken word poem he wrote called “Instagram.”
Wallace reached out to Nash, an 18-
year-old business administration and phi-
losophy freshman at Santa Fe College, to 
help bring Mellow Soul Tuesdays together when 
she learned about the Poetry, Entertainment, Arts, Comedians and Emceeing, or PEACE, club he cre-ated.
Nash said he was also looking to create poetry- 
and arts-centered events to encourage local talent when Wallace reached out to him.
He said they chose Rockeys as the venue af-
ter months of searching for an establishment that would ﬁ  t the mood they hoped to create.
Andrew Poe, general manager of Rockeys and 
a UF alumnus, said it’s a privilege to be a part of bringing Mellow Soul Tuesdays to the bar, and he’ll look forward to the event’s progress as it es-tablishes itself in the community.
“We’re taking part in a bigger thing that’s giv-
ing people the opportunity to express their pas-
sions in front of others and keeping the arts alive,” 
he said. “I see great things for the future.”Live art event launches at Rockeys

Music gently hovers over a 
swaying crowd, tickled by raised 
hands and voices that are carried 
up by the melodic vibrations of 
choral composition. It radiates off of faces filled with awe. 
Hope lives here — it’s made 
its home in the heart of the small sanctuary.
That hope began with one 
email that shook the destiny of the humble Abundant Grace 
Community Church.
In 2011, senior pastor Phil 
Courson prayed a simple prayer based on an impression during 
his Bible study — nothing out of the ordinary. He shared with as-sociate pastor Mike Gilland and 
other church leaders his desire 
to host contemporary Christian singer Brandon Heath in their 650-seat church. 
Gilland, who is also the wor-
ship leader, said he doubted if the event could flourish in a church 
that was still recovering from 
smaller concerts that financially fizzled earlier that year.
Two days later, Courson’s 
prayer was answered.
Gilland received an email 
from Heath’s agency asking if the church would be willing to host him.
But he said he didn’t recall 
ever sending an email — it’s still a mystery to this day.
“It was a big, big initial chal-
lenge for us to even think about 
doing that,” Gilland said. “But 
we prayed about it, and we just felt the green light all the way across.”
Tickets sold out a week in ad-
vance, flooding the auditorium — that doubles as a basketball court — to full capacity as Heath and his tourmates Dave Barnes and Kristian Stanfill led a sold-out concert in March 2011.
Heath, who 
won Male Vocal-ist of the Year at the Gospel Mu-sic Association’s 
Dove Awards 
in 2009 and 
2010, was the first famous Chris-tian singer to grace the church’s 
stage.
“It’s almost like the Lord just 
dropped this in our lap, and it 
came with that ironic request that Phil made,” Gilland said. “I 
don’t think it was irony. I believe 
God was opening a door for our church.”
The first home for Abundant 
Grace was Metro Life Church near Orlando. The Coursons and several other families who fol-lowed the church’s idea of taking the gospel to other cities, left their jobs and planted Abundant Grace in Gainesville.
It started in 1997 in a local 
condo meeting room. They pro-gressed to meeting in a middle school and an elementary school before opening their own build-
ing in 2007.
After the church began spon-
soring mainstream artists in 2011, 
more people saw what was hap-
pening inside the small church. It 
has since grown in membership, Gilland said.
The pastors pray about which 
bands to bring next, but usually 
it’s the artists who reach out to 
the church, he said.
“I think our adventure with 
doing concerts was completely 
unexpected,” Gilland said. “It has 
turned out to be such a delight-ful experience in so many differ-ent ways that we just scratch our heads about how we were able to 
do this.” THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 9 8, ALLIGATOR § THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2014

Thanksgiving is a celebration usu-
ally composed of food (turkey, of course), 
family (and friends — inclusivity is one of Thanksgiving’s beauties) and football (yes, we’re in the South). Gathering around the 
TV, Thanksgiving revelers let the food di-
gest before the slicing of pie(s). 
This combination of Thanksgiving and 
TV recalls one of the first TV dinners, at least for its food contents of Thanksgiving-inspired components and eating context in front of the TV.  
In 1954, the first pre-packaged meal 
by C.A. Swanson & Sons consisted of a 
Thanksgiving meal with compartments for 
the turkey with cornbread, dressing and gravy, and sides of peas and sweet pota-toes (both topped with a pat of butter). 
The company found itself overwhelmed 
with a huge surplus of frozen turkeys (260 tons) because of poor Thanksgiving sales. Swanson employee Gerry Thomas, in-spired by compartmentalized aluminum 
food trays being served by Pan American 
World Airlines, introduced the idea to the Swanson brothers. Nicknamed “Operation Smash,” the advertising campaign was a “smashing” success for both its advertis-ing on the nation’s latest excitement, the TV, and for its name, “TV Dinner,” which sealed the two together. That first year alone, TV dinners, at 98 cents per package, 
were a hit with over 25 million Swanson 
TV dinners sold to hungry Americans.     
More menus were developed. Desserts, 
such as apple cobbler and brownies, were added in 1960, and breakfast options, like pancakes and sausage, in 1969. Children’s por-
tions, foreign cuisine, 
organic entrees and vegetarian dishes are added to the frozen meals section in supermarkets today. 
With options such as plum ginger grain-
crusted fish, mini ravioli with vodka cream sauce and mayan harvest bake, today’s fro-zen ready-made meals offer “gourmet” op-tions and a reassuring backup meal just in 
case this year’s turkey doesn’t cook in time 
for the big meal.  
There are several theories about the name of the TV dinner. One is that the name originates from the shape of the tray it was served on. The compartments were similar to the front panels of a 1950s TV set: the large screen on the left and the speakers and control on the right. 
Another reason is that many families 
would eat the meals in front of a TV set. Also, some of the earliest packaging fea-tured an image of a TV set itself. 
The connection between TV and 
Thanksgiving continues, as more than 100 million Americans will gather on Thanks-giving with family and friends, not around the dinner table, but to watch as many as 15 straight hours of TV. 
As Americans’ new tradition, Thanks-
giving has become a TV-centric day, where we will watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade followed by NFL football games along with many advertisements for the pending Black Friday deals. 
So long as there is “thanks-giving,” 
what you eat on Thursday or where, be it the formal dining room table or on the 
living room couch, it should not matter 
as much as the spirit in which the meal is shared.

What started out as a joke became a social 
buzz in a matter of days.
Ken Peng couldn’t scroll through his Face-
book news feed without seeing the trending 
Facebook pages Humans of New York and 
Humans of UF as his friends continued to like 
the pages.
The 28-year-old businessman behind Ken 
Eats Gainesville noticed how these pages had the ability to give a voice to strangers in the area.
“I thought, ‘It can’t be real,’” Peng said. “I 
feel like a lot of it is embellished.”
Then, it got him thinking.
At 3 a.m. on Nov. 10, Peng created his own 
Facebook page: Non-Humans of Gainesville.
“My mission is to provide a voice to those 
who otherwise would never be heard. The 
trashcans, the parking meters, bad haircuts, and ceramic lions of our beautiful city,” Peng wrote on the page.
Known as the local writer for unfiltered 
food reviews, Peng decided to create a more 
spontaneous page for his personal use, as well as general amusement.  
“I wanted to do a parody to give a voice to 
inanimate objects,” Peng said.
To his surprise, the page became an in-
stant hit and has more than 1,900 likes and 
counting.
“I’m certainly sur-
prised,” Peng said. “It’s a stupid page.”
Bubba Silcox, 21, was 
skeptical of Peng’s page at first. He said he was scroll-ing through his Facebook news feed when he came across it.
“I’m sitting here thinking, ‘What in the 
heck is this?’” the UF history senior said.
After he clicked on it and read some of the 
posts, Silcox thought the page was actually a pretty creative way to incorporate important, distinguished landmarks throughout the city.
Silcox said his favorite post so far is the 
one about the south endzone goal post for the past two decades, who Peng calls Trevor.
“I thought it was hilarious,” Silcox said.

Your middle school crush and 
Tampa native Aaron Carter will be 
returning to Gainesville on Sunday 
at the High Dive, along with open-
ing acts The Crazy Carls, Sona Holi-day and Katie Hargrove.
The Avenue spoke with Carter 
about the changing landscape of the music industry, his upcoming al-bum release and his dream musical collaboration. Hint: It’s another ‘90s pop icon. 
Last year you were here for the 
nostalgia tour, but now you’re on the Wonderful World Tour promot-
ing your new album. Can you tell 
me more about the new record?
I’ve been collaborating with some 
amazing writers. I’m looking for-ward to getting back into the music 
game. It’s gonna take a hot second 
for people to understand who I am today as a man and, like, a grown up dude. But that’s fine. I just have to 
keep pushing at it and focus on the 
music I’m doing today. 
Any word on when it will be 
released?
It’s up in the air. But it’s gonna 
happen in the second quarter of next year, as far as I know right now … There’s a lot of politics that go be-hind it.
So with the new batch of songs 
then, are you planning on retiring some of your old hits like “I Want Candy” and “That’s How I Beat Shaq”?
No, I think that’ll always be part 
of the stuff I do. I love that music, 
and that’s how people grew up with me. They can always get it from me.
Do you have any crazy stories 
from your meet-and-greets?
What I’ve been starting to gather, 
which is amazing, is that my fans 
will get lyrics autographed on their 
face. I think that’s so, so hard for me 
to comprehend. How do you com-
prehend that? I’m not the kind of guy to be like, “I’m the shit, I’m so cool.” I’m looking at it, like, what’s 
going on?
Even though you’ve been at it 
since you were 7, it’s still surreal to 
you?
Exactly! It’s really weird for me to 
deal with. Sometimes I catch myself in this realization moments at meet-and-greets with people, and they’re 
crying. I don’t know. I think when I 
was a kid, I overlooked it. But now that I’m an adult, I’m like, what’s go-ing on?
So what do you do when a fan 
starts crying in front of you?
I get embarrassed! I’m like, “Oh 
my God, why are you crying?” I 
want to make them feel better. It’s really weird.
You’re in a unique position, 
more so than other young pop stars on the scene right now —  you’ve 
been doing this since you were 7. Can you tell me about some of the ways you’ve seen the industry change?
I saw the evolution of social me-
dia. I was here before it, and I’m here after it. That’s probably the cra-ziest thing. The industry is just full 
of change, and everything changes 
so fast. You gotta stay up with the game, constantly releasing new mu-sic or else you fall off.
Your brother, Nick Carter, re-
leased a memoir last year. Are you planning on writing a book any-time soon about your turbulent 
career?
No. To be honest, I’m not the 
kind of guy that wants to be success-
ful off all the negative stuff that’s 
happened in my career. I’d like to 
be the guy who remembers all the bad stuff that happens and then not talk about it. I think that’s kind of —  bad. I have to be choosy with 
my words here. Writing books, like 
—  not much is going to be positive. It’s nobody’s business. How can I entertain you if you’re sitting in the audience thinking about all the bad stuff that I’ve done?
I found a Teen People Online 
Chat interview you did in 2001. Is it OK if I ask you a few of the same 
questions they asked then?You’re gonna ask me the same 
questions they asked me in 2001? 
That’s awesome. 
OK, here we go: If you could 
collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who would it be?
Christina Aguilera. 
Which song?
Maybe, like, “We Found Love” 
by Rihanna.
Favorite type of car?1957 Chevy Mustang GT500. 
Craziest thing a fan has ever 
done?
Scaled up a building to get into 
my room, 2005 I think it was. It 
was crazy. She knocked me down, 
ripped out a bunch of my hair, said some Spanish shit and ran out.
Last one: Describe your perfect 
date. 
Getting on a private jet, having 
a gourmet chef up there, landing in Paris, listening to Cole Porter, walk-
ing in the rain in Paris at night. 
That’s a pretty solid perfect 
date. 
Pretty good, right? I try.

Before you go home for Thanks-
giving to see your (hopefully not 
bickering) family, the best way to pre-celebrate is by having Friends-giving with your (again, hopefully not bickering) friend family in your dorm. I mean, you’ve probably seen these people naked in those (awful) communal showers. The least you can do is share a dinner.
When I was a freshman, we 
gathered in the dorm’s commu-nal kitchen and forged our own makeshift Thanksgiving dinner. Food overflowed from the small plasterboard table that was pushed into the cramped corners, and we feasted like kings (queens).The best way to organize a 
Friendsgiving is to first figure out who brings what. But to do that, you need to know which foods are plausible to make in a commu-nal kitchen. However good your mom’s made-from-scratch cinna-mon rolls with orange glaze are, the other people in your hall are going to hate you for taking up the entire counter and covering everything in butter and flour. 
And do you really need to roast 
a 15-pound turkey in the dorm?
I’m sure you’ve already figured 
this out, but most food made in a microwave can turn out just as well as if it were made on a stove or in an oven. And that’s exactly how you’re going to make this dinner happen. Before Thanksgiving, 
have Friendsgiving
Dessert
There’s always a baking guru in every hall, for some rea -
son. Either let this person handle the insanity that goes with 
making a palatable pie crust, or go ahead and buy that pie. What on earth is Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie and Cool Whip?Veggies
There are two ways to do this one: You can either buy those “steam-in-bag” veggies that are usually on sale at Publix, or you can roast some in the oven. With either option, I sug -
gest tossing the veggies in a little olive oil or butter and adding salt/pepper be-fore cooking. Stuffing
Buy a box of pre-made 
stuffing. Seriously. Kraft-brand Stove Top is $2 at Wal-Mart, and you don’t have to cook it on the stove (there are microwave direc -
tions on the box).
Mashed Potatoes
Start by cutting your pota -
toes into eighths and put -
ting them in a bowl with 
enough water to completely submerge them. Microwave for around 6 minutes, then strain them, toss them in a pot with some butter and milk and mash them/cook them on low heat until they are at the perfect consis -
tency. Green Bean Casserole
This was a personal pref -
erence, but we decided to 
bake a full green bean cas -
serole. There are just some home-cooked foods that you can’t skimp out on, man.Protein
I can’t stress this enough: Buy your meats from somewhere 
that will prepare them for you. For the vegetarian/vegan, you can grab protein alternates from the grocery store and bake them. But it is a huge hassle to prepare all that meat in the dorm. Do you really need another excuse to buy Publix fried chicken? I don’t think so.BUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Amanda Butler and the 
UF women’s basketball team head to Queens, New York, to take on St. John’s tonight at 7.alligatorSports Podcast
Check out the alligatorSports podcast as Richard Johnson, Jordan McPherson, Morgan Moriarty and Jonathan Czupryn discuss  Florida’s coaching search.JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Florida’s defense may be ranked 20th in the country, but 
it’s tough to notice that early on in games.
In Southeastern Conference play this season, opponents 
have been outscoring the Gators 59-35 in the first quarter.In the last three games alone, Florida has given up 24 
points while scoring just seven of its own.
“Teams are executing against us, too,” defensive co-
ordinator D.J. Durkin said. “Give them credit. Guys have 
bounced back in each one of those and really tie those down and made some adjustments on the side and they played well on the side of it. I’d like for us to start faster and not give up that quick seven.”
Muschamp still wants to coach: While he won’t be re-
turning to Florida next season, Will Muschamp does not want his coaching career to end following the 2014 season.
“I’d like to obviously be working next year,” Muschamp 
said on Wednesday’s SEC’s coaches teleconference. “But certainly after the FSU game Carol and I will take a little time and sit down and see what our next step is. I’m look-ing forward to that next step, but what that will be I have no idea.”
Muschamp said he’ll start handling the specifics about 
his life beyond the Gators in two weeks, following the Flori-da-Florida State game on Nov. 29.
“I haven’t put any thought into that as far as where, what, 
when and how, I don’t know all those things. Certainly right 
now my focus is on this team and getting us ready for these 
next two games.”
McGee undecided: Redshirt senior tight end Jake Mc-
Gee didn’t even play two quarters of football in his debut at 
Florida before his season came to an end.
McGee, who transferred from Virginia over the summer, 
suffered a fractured fibula and tibia during Florida’s 65-0 
win against Eastern Michigan on Sept. 6.
On Wednesday, Muschamp said McGee hasn’t decided if 
he wants to seek a sixth year of college football eligibility.
“I told him that I was going to contact some general man-
agers and some guys that make the decisions in the National Football League and give him some guidance on what is the best thing,” Muschamp said.
McNeely honored: Redshirt senior Mike McNeely — 
who is known most for returning a fake field goal 21-yards for a touchdown in the second quarter of Florida’s 38-20 win against Georgia — will be recognized with a National Foot-ball Foundation Legacy Award, the foundation announced Wednesday.
“Mike is somebody who has taken full advantage of ev-
ery opportunity that has been given to him,” NFF Chairman Archie Manning said in a release, “and we hope that his ac-complishments will inspire the next generation.”
Injury update:  Safeties Keanu Neal (high ankle) and 
Duke Dawson (turf toe) should play in Florida’s home finale against Eastern Kentucky, Muschamp said Wednesday.

FootbAllFlorida defense looks to improve in first quarter efficiency

With a season as dominant as 
Florida volleyball’s, it is easy to for-
get that the Gators will be losing one 
of its most talented backrows in the 
history of the program.
Seniors Holly Pole, Taylor Unroe 
and Maddie Monserez will make 
their exit from Florida (21-3, 15-0 
Southeastern Conference) once the NCAA Tournament winds down.
Collectively, the three seniors have 
ranked low in the NCAA for digs, but 
their ability to make a reception and 
keep a play moving Florida’s back-row defense has elevated the offense this season.
Players like freshman Rhamat Al-
hassan, who is second in the NCAA 
with a .468 hitting percentage, are 
proof of the defense’s ability to help produce offensive efficiency.
“They have been the backbone of 
this team, both offensively and defen-sively and what they’ve allowed with their play is to let the other players do what they do best,” coach Mary Wise said. 
“If Alex Holston was asked to be a 
primary serve receiver it would take Seniors key in SEC successSocceR

One game at a time.
That’s the mindset the Gators have as 
they head into their second weekend of the 
NCAA Tournament, a weekend in which 
they could potentially play two games should they advance past California in the second round on Friday night.
But this experienced Florida team knows 
looking ahead isn’t in its best interests. Any game could be its last, and with eight se-niors on the roster, that sense of finality car-ries extra weight.
The players are treating the game against 
Cal - and each game going forward - with that in mind, knowing if they don’t come to play with a sense of urgency, the season will be over.
“It’s everybody’s last game,” senior 
midfielder Havana Solaun said. “So Fri-day night, whoever’s playing that night, it could be your last game, so I think it comes down to who wants it more.”
The season being over is something the 
players and coaches have dreaded all year, saying repeatedly they have savored this year and the time spent together more than 
the usual team does.
“This has just been a very fulfilling sea-
son with this group,” coach Becky Burleigh 
said. “Some of that has to do with results - but not very much of it. I think most of it 
just has to do with the people.”UF preps for 2nd NCAA game

See SocceR, p Age 15See volley, p Age 15Solaun said she feels the 
same way, and knowing the 
time with this unit is coming 
to an end is worse than the 
fear of getting knocked out of the tournament.
“This team we have this 
year is so special, and I think that every day we get to keep going we all cherish because we all love playing together, we love practicing together,” 
she said.
To keep the journey go-
ing, Florida will need to keep 
winning, and as the competi-
tion gets tougher with each 
round, more will be required to survive.
Burleigh knows escap-ing this weekend will be no easy feat, but she believes her team has what it takes to 
handle the challenge.
“I think it’s gonna take a 
lot of character,” she said. 
“I think it’s gonna take a lot of us being able to be resil-
ient when we face adversity, 
because there’s no doubt that’s gonna happen at some point.
“But I think all of the ex-
periences we’ve had up to this point in the season have kinda prepared us for this moment.”
With so much at stake, 
that moment is the only thing the Gators are focused on.
“For us, it’s the same thing 
we’ve been doing all year,” Solaun said. “One game at a time.”THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Holly Pole speaks with coach Mary Wise during Florida’s 3-0 win against Mississippi State on Oct. 
26 in the O’Connell Center. Pole’s career with Florida will be over after the NCAA Tournament. She is one of three defensive players that will leave the Gators this season.
UF starting backrow is graduating
away from her offense. If our left 
sides were asked to do that then the same thing. So those three by 
being the nucleus on first contact 
and whether its serve receive or defense, they’ve allowed every-one else to excel on the team.”
Having three seniors — play-
ers who have known each other since their freshman and sopho-more years — has proven effec-tive for Florida. 
The chemistry built among 
Pole, Unroe and Monserez has provided Florida with the ability 
to hold all but two of its SEC op-
ponents under a .200 team hitting clip, with the exception of Arkan-sas (.228) and Kentucky (.240). 
“Being seniors we obviously 
know the positions a lot better,” Pole said. 
“… We’ve played next to each 
other for so long we can kind of 
anticipate each others moves and 
know where the other person’s going to be in certain situations so that helps as well.”
With SEC play wrapping up 
and the postseason just around the corner, Wise and Pole look 
to keep Florida’s season going as 
long as possible.
But even if the season were 
to be cut short, Pole’s expecta-tions of the season wouldn’t be 
dashed.
“It has exceeded my expecta-
tions so far,” Pole said. 
“It’s a different group of girls 
than we’ve had in the past and 
everybody has really bought into making our team better no mat-ter who’s across the net from us. I think that’s what’s made it so 
special.”Volley , from page 14
