Gainesville Police are looking for a mys-
tery man suspected of peeing on at least four 
unsuspecting victims, which prompted a 
UF Alert sent to faculty, staff and students 
Wednesday afternoon. 
GPD is investigating four counts of bat-
tery and exposure of sexual organs ranging 
from Feb. 22 through March 1.
Four victims reported suddenly feeling someone urinating on them at different times between the 100 and 200 blocks of Northwest 
17th Street and the 900 block of West Univer-sity Avenue. 
The suspect exposed himself and left 
whenever victims confronted him, the alert stated.
Victims describe the suspect as a 6-foot 
black male between 25 and 30 years old with a medium to large build, according to the 
alert.  They reported he has short curly hair, a dark complexion and was last seen wearing a dark hoodie and baggy jeans.
Gainesville Police encourages anyone 
with information to call the department at 
352-955-1818 or text keyword GPDFL with 
the tip to 274637.
Gainesville Police also reported another 
incident of public urination over the week-
end.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 24-year-old Michael Ed-
win Wilks on Sunday on charges of public urination, according to an arrest report.
At about 1:30 a.m., Wilks peed on a car in 
a parking lot at 200 E. University Ave. 
Ofﬁ  cers reported it was in a well-lit area in 
full view of people walking downtown. 
He was “extremely intoxicated,” accord-
ing to the report. Wilks is also on probation as of March 2013 for burglary.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Wilks into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 3:29 a.m. As of press 
time, his bond had not been set.Peeing-on-pedestrians trend trickles through townCRIME
� PREVIOUSLY, A UFID NUMBER AND 
INSURANCE PAPERS WERE NEEDED.

Before you check in at the Inﬁ  rmary, the 
Student Health Care Center needs to check 
you out.
Starting today, students seeking treatment 
on campus must show a photo ID at all loca-tions — clinic counters, the blood-work lab 
and the pharmacy.
Toni Ratliff, the center’s associate direc-
tor, said the measure is an effort to prevent 
fraud.
In the past, students could check in with 
only their UFID number and proof of health insurance.
“It’s just an attempt at doing a better job at 
verifying a patient’s identity,” Ratliff said.
Now, if students forget their ID, she said they must also provide a phone number and current address as a placeholder.
Ratliff said pharmacy labs already asked 
for photo identiﬁ  cation because of potential narcotics fraud.“It’s becoming a standard,” she said. 
“Rather than having it in some parts, we’re doing it systemwide.”
Alex Barshel, a 21-year-old UF environ-
mental science junior, said she wasn’t asked 
for an ID during a checkup before Spring 
Break but wouldn’t mind showing it in the 
future to streamline the process.
“Those services are for UF students only, 
and they should be able to make sure that’s who they are serving,” she said.UF health care center now requires photo ID at all locations

STAFF REPORT
editor@alligator.org
On the ﬁ  rst day of Spring 
Break, UF students — most of 
them miles from Gainesville — woke up to UF Alerts about crime in the city.
The ﬁ  rst message about 
an on-campus stabbing went out at about 7 a.m. Hours lat-er, the suspect, 28-year-old Michael Matthew Cravey, died from ofﬁ  cer-inﬂ  icted injuries after he charged at police with a hatchet.
The morning began when 
Cravey stabbed a man in the parking lot behind Leigh Hall near Library West, said University Police Maj. Brad Barber. 
Cravey left in a black Jeep; a car chase ensued. 
When Cravey began run-
ning red lights and driving the wrong direction on New-berry Road, police deemed it too dangerous to continue.
At about 9:50 a.m., the 
Jeep crashed into another car on Archer Road, injuring that driver. Cravey ran on 
foot into Butler Plaza.
Roughly 10 minutes later, 
Gainesville Police Lt. Mike 
Schibuola saw Cravey hid-ing a hatchet in front of Best Buy, according to a GPD press release. The ofﬁ  cer confronted him. 
Cravey ran with the hatch-
et in the air, “coming within feet of striking” Schibuola, according to the release. The ofﬁ  cer ﬁ  red shots that hit Cravey, who later died at UF Health Shands Hospital. 
No ofﬁ  cers were harmed.Police shoot suspect

MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3
March 14, 1995 
Students were calling UF to sign up for Summer 
classes. The pilot program TeleGator allowed stu-dents to register for the classes they wanted by dialing in the section numbers using their telephones. How-
ever, the system had some bugs to work out. Then-UF 
associate registrar Steve Pritz said some students had problems using the correct PIN numbers assigned to each class, and some had difficulty registering for classes without the necessary prerequisites. UF sophomore Lauren Hoyt who used the system said the TeleGator hung up on her when she first used it, but she was able to sign up for all of her first-choice classes. Another UF sophomore, Anna Tang, was able 
to sign up for 10 credit hours, at the desk in her dor-
mitory, and got through on her first call.  
March 14, 2001At the groundbreaking ceremony for UF’s Honors 
Residential College at Hume Hall, then-UF President Charles Young joined representatives of the Division of Housing, Honors Program and Academic Affairs Division wearing Gator hard hats and carrying gold 
shovels. The $18.1 million project was scheduled to 
be completed by Fall 2002 and would house about 600 students and areas for faculty housing as well, according to Alligator archives. The student suites would consist of two double rooms joined by a bath-room. The rooms were priced at about $2,300 per se-mester. “Students will have the opportunities that a large university offers, but at the same time they will have the close-knit community which allows for char-
acter building that a small college offers,” said David 
Duncan, a member of the committee developing the new facility. The old Hume Hall was demolished.

AFTER THE MH370 INCIDENT.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — The Boeing 777 
flown by Malaysia Airlines that dis-
appeared Saturday morning over the South China Sea is one of the world’s most popular — and safest — jets.
The long-range jumbo jet has helped 
connect cities at the far ends of the globe with flights as long as 16 hours. But more impressive is its safety record: The first fatal crash in its 19-year histo-ry only came last July when an Asiana Airlines jet landed short of the runway in San Francisco. Three of the 307 peo-ple aboard died.
Airlines like the plane because it is 
capable of flying extremely long dis-tances thanks to two giant engines. Each engine is so massive that a row of at least five coach seats could fit in-side it. By having just two engines, the 
plane burns through less fuel than four-
engine jets, like the Boeing 747, which it has essentially replaced.
“It has provided a new standard in 
both efficiency and safety,” said Rich-ard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant with the Teal Group. “The 777 has en-joyed one of the safest records of any jetliner built.”
Besides last year’s Asiana crash, the 
only other serious incident with the 777 came in January 2008 when a Brit-ish Airways jet landed about 1,000 feet short of the runway at London’s Heath-row Airport.
Malaysia Airlines did have an inci-
dent in August 2005 with a 777 flying from Perth, Australia, to Kuala Lum-pur, Malaysia’s largest city. While fly-ing 38,000 feet above the Indian Ocean, the plane’s software incorrectly mea-sured speed and acceleration, causing 
the plane to suddenly shoot up 3,000 
feet. The pilot disengaged the autopilot and descended and landed safely back in Perth. A software update was quick-ly made on planes around the world.
Malaysia Airlines has 15 Boeing 
777-200ER jets in its fleet of about 100 planes. The first was delivered on April 
23, 1997, and the most recent on Dec. 13, 
2004, according to Boeing. The 200ER is one of four versions of the 777.

Two UF alumni are looking to change the way people surf 
the Internet with their new web app Searchlet.
Mark Fazzini and Spencer Simonsen were featured on 
TechCrunch on Friday for the app they released in Decem-
ber. Once a user highlights text on any web page, the app pulls up a sidebar of results from multiple search engines re-lating to the selected word or phrase.
Fazzini, a 25-year-old alternative investments associate 
for Tampa-based company Raymond James, said the app helps users avoid opening dozens of tabs when researching a topic.“We thought about how nice it would be to consolidate all 
the information you needed in one area,” he said.
The search engines currently include Grooveshark, 
Google and Twitter, but he said the pair plans to add more search options for the app as it progresses. They intend to eventually open the code to the public so anyone can person-alize the app.
Jonathan Burnett, a 21-year-old UF computer engineering 
junior, said he isn’t sure how the two entrepreneurs plan to 
make money off the app, but the concept is unique.
“This is useful as a research tool and kind of a life hack as 
far as doing things faster,” he said. “It just doesn’t seem like 
something I’d use all the time.”UF alumni create searching web app“It has provided a new

Meet the 2014 Gainesville City Commission candidates
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer
kvarn@alligator.org
Annie Orlando sat 
in her office holding a 
purple tote bag adver-
tising her City Commission At-Large Seat 2 campaign screenprinted on the front.
“I’ve got them on the merchandise side 
of campaigning, that’s for sure,” she said.
Orlando, owner of Atlas Screen Print-
ing in southeast Gainesville, said she plans to use her business experience to carry out her commission platform, which consists of holding the commission to a higher standard, supporting the development of east Gainesville and getting Gainesville 
Regional Utilities back on track. 
Orlando, 59, said she became involved 
in city government after watching it 
change during the 25 years she has lived 
in town. To hold the commission more accountable, Orlando said she’s going to 
encourage more resident involvement by extending citizen comment privileges dur-
ing commission meetings.
“You can’t make good decisions unless 
you keep an open mind and listen to all 
points of view,” she said.
As Orlando’s involvement in local 
government grew, she became a found-
ing member of the East Gainesville Devel-opment Task Force, now called the East Gainesville Development Corporation. Although she’s not involved in the non-profit now, she said she plans to continue building up that area of town. 
Additionally, Orlando said she wants 
to find a new GRU general manager, one who will help the city “get back on its feet” after energy prices skyrocketed.
Sam Collins, 67, said he decided to 
head Orlando’s campaign because of her ability to bring people together. 
“We forget sometimes we’re really all 
trying to get the same thing. We don’t 
need to be so toxic,” he said. “Annie brings 
an antidote to that kind of politics.”

If there is money go-
ing into or coming from 
the City Commission, 
Donald Shepherd Sr. wants to understand how and why each cent is allocated.
One of five candidates running for the 
At-Large Seat 2 chair, 60-year-old Shep-herd said he wants to restructure the com-mission’s budget.
“I first would look through the finan-
cial budget and then address how it is handed out to each department so more housing and jobs can come to Gainesville,” he said.
Shepherd, who’s looking to take over 
incumbent Thomas Hawkins’ seat, is run-ning on a platform of balancing the com-mission’s budget, increasing workers’ wages and fixing Gainesville’s damaged roads such as 61st Street, Tower Road and Eighth Street.A Gainesville resident since 1997, 
Shepherd worked at UF’s Physical Plant Division until 2011, contributing to design plans for the Hilton University of Florida 
Conference Center Gainesville on South-
west 34th Street, according to Alligator archives.
If elected, he said he wants to help stu-
dents by changing operating standards for landlords. He also said he wants to see tu-ition lowered for students.
Additionally, Shepherd said he wants 
to put meters on Gainesville’s water tow-
ers to measure organizations’ use so the 
city doesn’t exhaust its aquifer.      
His campaign manager and wife, Nan-
cy Shepherd, 60, said her husband is a step ahead of the other candidates because he’s attended nearly every board, commission and committee meeting since 2012.
“He is the best candidate because he’s 
been learning this for the past three years,” 
she said.

Mark Venzke has 
turned his energy to 
utilities reform.
The 56-year-old 
Gainesville resident who ran for mayor 
last spring is now making his bid for City 
Commission At-Large Seat 2, and his plat-form focuses on revamping Gainesville Regional Utilities operations. 
He wants to add a paid board of direc-
tors comprised of experts to oversee city utilities, he said, because it would relieve city commissioners of dealing with issues 
they may not have time for or fully under-
stand. 
Venzke is also calling for a higher level 
of accountability in city government.
“What we need and what I publicly call 
for is full protection for any whistleblow-ers who want to talk to the city commis-sioners or managers,” he said.Venzke said if elected, he would push 
the commission to pursue an investigation of management practices and decisions surrounding the biomass energy project.
“That contract was negotiated irregu-
larly and has many provisions that are highly disadvantageous to Gainesville and GRU ratepayers,” he said. 
Overall, Venzke said he believes there 
is “much good” in Gainesville, and he is 
invested in bringing a higher level of orga-
nization to local government. 
“The issues are so important … and the 
effects are so far-reaching, and they get so little quality attention that I feel I cannot ignore them,” he said.
Levi Colson Sr., one of Venzke’s neigh-
bors, said he supports Venzke’s efforts to revitalize the community. He said Venzke 
would be a voice for “the homeless, the 
helpless, the poor people.” 
“He’s been helping the whole neigh-
borhood out,” he said. “It would be real good if he were part of the commission.”ALEX HARRIS

To Helen K. Warren, 
holding political office 
is a lot like buying a 
house. To make the buyers happy, a real-tor has to listen to what clients need, find 
solutions to problems that arise and nego-
tiate a compromise.
Warren, 60, has been a realtor for 11 
years, but this March marks her first foray into government as she seeks elec-tion for the At-Large Seat 2 in Tuesday’s Gainesville City Commission elections.
She hopes to bring the skills she has 
gained selling homes to local government, 
particularly the ability to bring in experts 
on the city’s more technical problems.
Warren’s platform seeks to make 
Gainesville a city that encourages sustain-able growth, energy-efficiency and job creation. She said she hopes to encourage 
Gainesville Regional Utilities to help resi-dents find ways to lower their utility bills 
with energy-efficient measures.
This is part of Warren’s goal to plan for 
intelligent growth within the city, which 
includes improved bus routes, more walk-
able areas and multiple-use roadways.
“Growth is going to happen,” she said. 
“We need to put our services into place for the growing population.”
As the former president of the local 
chapter of the National Audubon Society, an environmental nonprofit, Warren said she made many friends and supporters, 
including Stacie Greco.
Greco, an environmental professional, 
bought a home through Warren before be-
coming an avid supporter.
Greco said she believes Warren’s skills 
as a creative problem-solver and commu-nicator will help her in political office.
“She finds common ground and brings 
people together,” she said. “We need 
someone who can work with others, not 
cause more conflict.”

Even though she 
grew up in Fort Lauder-
dale, Gainesville will 
always be her home.
Susan Bottcher, the District 3 city com-
missioner, has lived in Gainesville since she was a UF student. After serving almost a full three-year term as a commissioner, Bottcher is running for a second term. 
Bottcher said she didn’t plan to get 
involved in city politics, but as she wove together a life in Gainesville, it naturally developed with community volunteering. Then, her small scale involvement grew in 
the political direction. 
“After a while, when the District 3 Seat 
came open, people sat me down, and they 
said ‘You’re a good fit for the district, you know the district — you need to run for this seat,’” she said.
As a UF alumna, Bottcher emphasizes the importance of student involvement. Her first campaign was run almost entire-ly by UF students. 
“There are people in Gainesville who 
believe that students are part-timers,” she said. “That has not been my experience. To me (UF students) are some of the most intelligent, motivated individuals I have ever encountered.”
The biggest issue Bottcher hopes to 
correct is growing Gainesville’s property tax base. About 60 percent of property in Gainesville is associated with UF, Santa 
Fe and churches, and those entities do not 
pay property taxes, Bottcher said. 
“That means we have to do a whole lot 
with an extraordinarily small revenue,” she said. 
Nath Doughtie said he’s noticed the 
commissioner always provides logical ra-tionale for her suggested policies.  
“I might not always agree with her 
vote, but she always comes up with a good reason for her position,” he said.

Craig Carter wants 
to get down to busi-
ness. That’s one of the reasons he’s running 
in Tuesday’s election for Gainesville City 
Commission District 3.
Carter, 54, has been a small-business 
owner since he moved to Gainesville two 
decades ago, and he’s calling for a better business focus and accountability in local government. He said he’d like to see the commission adjust its priorities.
“We don’t need fancy trolleys, fancy 
buses, bad contracts,” he said. “What we need are business people.”
That focus would include promoting 
a climate that’s conducive to small busi-nesses, which he said can provide better training experiences and wages than large chains.
“If we were to buy local as much as we can, it would be self-curing,” he said.
Carter, who founded Craig Carter Golf 
Carts and Craig Carter Mobility, said his main mission is to lower electric rates and make the city more transparent.
“Gainesville is a wonderful place,” he 
said. “It’s a beautiful place. It’s so diverse. It has everything you ever want. But we’re spending money poorly.”
He also prioritizes investing in students. 
As a volunteer with UF campus ministry Reformed University Fellowship, he said he’s probably hosted a couple thousand students for gameday parties and socials at his home during the last decade.
“That’s my passion — young people 
and students,” he said.
Gainesville Mayor Ed Braddy said 
Carter takes a reasonable, common-sense 
approach to resolving issues.
“He’s a problem-solver,” Braddy said. 
“It’s in his nature. When he hears there’s 
a problem, he doesn’t sit around trying to find someone to blame.”Annie Orlando

Win or lose, District 2 candidate and 
former UF Faculty Senate chairwoman 
Cheri Brodeur will soon say goodbye to the university. She plans to retire in 
2015. 
But as city elections near, she said she would like to see 
a more uniﬁ  ed Gainesville — starting with residents and students.
“I really see the value in using your Student Govern-
ment,” said Brodeur, 65. “It’s your town too, and there needs to be some input from the students.”
Brodeur, who also serves as coordinator for the UF 
IFAS program development and evaluation center, said her ties to students and the university set her apart from 
the competition. She has lived in Gainesville for 30 years 
and said the city needs advisory groups to talk about points of contention between students and residents.
“People need to understand what students are going 
through and what they need,” Brodeur said. “It goes both ways.”
Her other platform focuses on Gainesville’s infrastruc-
ture, particularly roads and transportation, as well as ris-ing Gainesville Regional Utilities rates.
Sue Alvers, an administrative assistant through the 
Faculty Senate, said Brodeur’s strength is representing groups of people. She said Brodeur “basically just asks people to work together.”Cheri Broudeur

Three years ago, Todd Chase ran for 
City Commission because of his mother. 
A retiree living on a ﬁ  xed income, Chase’s mother felt the bite of Gainesville’s ﬁ  re 
assessment fee, which was adopted by the commission in 
2010 to plug a hole in the budget.
“She was sitting there, she had tears in her eyes, and 
she said ‘Where am I gonna get this money?” Chase said. 
“That’s when the light went off for me, and I realized local government affects our lives more than any other level.”
Chase, 47, is running for re-election in the District 2 race 
in Tuesday’s city elections. With rising utility rates and a roughly $20 million city deﬁ  cit looming, Chase said he’s looking to lend his business expertise gained from his Har-
vard MBA and leadership in about a dozen start-up com-
panies.
During his ﬁ  rst term, Chase butted heads with other 
commissioners over issues such as the Gainesville Renew-
able Energy Center, Gainesville Regional Utilities rates and 
red-light cameras. In this race, his main goal is maintaining 
GRU’s viability as a business because it provides almost half 
of the city’s roughly $100 million operating budget.
Sam Coons, Chase’s best friend of 25 years, said Chase’s 
business experience and integrity make him a great ﬁ  t for the ofﬁ  ce.
“He brings a common-sense perspective that’s very 
unique,” Coons, 52, said.Todd Chase

The ﬁ  rst vote Sheryl Eddie’s young-
est daughter casts will be for her mom. 
At least, Eddie hopes so.
After raising three girls in Gainesville 
and spending years working in nonproﬁ  ts, Eddie, 48, is 
now running for the District 2 City Commission seat to 
help kids and families in her adopted home.
“I love this community, even though I’m a Seminole,” 
said the ﬁ  rst-time candidate at a Feb. 11 fundraiser.
Eddie said in her 25 years as a resident, she’s noticed 
a disconnect between the commission and residents. She said she hopes to draw on her background in the commu-nications ﬁ  eld to bring civility back to the commission and focus on her district’s most vulnerable.
Improving bus service in areas beyond UF’s campus 
would help both families and students, she said.
“Just because the budget comes from UF doesn’t mean 
the students want to stay in that little circle,” Eddie said.
She said she also wants to push for more streetlights 
to help reduce criminal activity. As community outreach 
coordinator for the Early Learning Coalition of Alachua 
County, Eddie has seen poverty up close. She said simple things like lights will help those in need.
Longtime friend Lewis Mazzarella said Eddie’s city 
understanding makes her a natural for the commission.
“She’ll go out there and knock on doors and get peo-
ple’s attention,” he said.Sheryl Eddie

Spring Break: 
Great for economy, 
not for state image
USA Today reported Sunday that Florida remains the go-
to Spring Break destination for American students, and for good reason. South Florida residents live in a peren-
nial tropical paradise, which explains why so many people from New York and New Jersey tend to retire — read: drive badly 
and complain about the lack of good pizza — there. And, of 
course, Panama City Beach in the panhandle remains a popular Spring Break destination, famous for its cheap accommodations, wild beach parties and inevitable drunken falling-off-balconies incidents.             
This year, as record cold temperatures in the Northeast have 
college students looking to Florida for a warm escape, Florida tourism experts are predicting 2014 to be a record-breaking year for Spring Breaks spent in the Sunshine State. 
“Though Florida’s spring break hot spots evolve, with some 
cities dropping off students’ radar and others popping back on, statewide tourism continues to grow during January, February and March,” USA Today writer Rick Neale reported. “Out-of-state visitors during those months have increased from 19.4 million in 2000 to an all-time high of 26.3 million last year, Visit Florida data shows. That’s a 36 percent jump.”
The history of Spring Break in Florida is nothing if not politi-
cal. 
While Panama City Beach, Cocoa Beach and the Orlando 
area are currently among the biggest hot spots for in- and out-of-state students, according to USA Today, it hasn’t always been that way. Fort Lauderdale — nicknamed “Ft. Liquordale” back in its Spring Break heyday of the 1970s — had enough of the hordes of students wreaking havoc on the city. According to TIME, toward the end of the ‘80s, a combination of stricter public-drinking laws and hotel-occupancy standards limiting college students from cramming large groups into single rooms 
drove Spring Breakers to other areas of the state. 
Last year, the Walton Sun reported, the Walton County Sher-
iff’s Ofﬁ  ce deputies issued 1,098 Notice to Appears — mostly 
for underage drinking. Walton is located just outside Panama City in the Bay area. This year already a Texas student has gone missing in Panama City.
Although popular Spring-Break destination cities increase 
law enforcement and make noises about aggressively cracking down on college students’ bad behavior, cities such as Daytona 
Beach, Orlando and Panama City are in a bind: Though students 
cause damage to both the facilities and reputations of the cities they clamor to, those city ofﬁ  cials aren’t likely to attempt a Fort Lauderdale-style exorcism of Spring Breakers. 
Indeed, sleepy beach towns like Panama City rely on the 
tourism dollars that college students bring every year from Janu-ary to March. 
Unfortunately for lovers of peace, quiet and pristine beaches, 
Spring Breakers will ﬂ  ock to Florida regardless of one or two cit-
ies’ efforts to push them away. 
We just have a little advice for those out-of-state Florida new-
bies: wear sunscreen, and stay away from balconies.Conservatives fail to accept changing US 
Conservatives ﬂ  ocked to Washington, D.C., last week 
for the Conservative Political Action Conference to rally behind conservative leaders and discuss their 
core ideological beliefs. Sadly, the week produced the same rhetoric spouted by conservatives — most of whom identify 
as Republicans — that many young Americans and minori-
ties, more often than not, reject.
Conservative writers like Ann Coulter denounced any ef-
fort by the American government to reform its immigration system, decrying the “browning of America.” Yes, the wom-an said something that appears horribly racist on the surface, yet continually receives an invitation to speak at CPAC.
In a panel on minority outreach, a picture hit the Web that 
showed an empty room with hardly a soul in sight.  
It’s pretty much a given that in order to win national elec-
tions, minority voters are key — especially Latino voters. Instead of courting them, we hear conservatives make seem-ingly racist remarks about immigrants and minority groups, and a minority outreach panel fell on deaf ears — or, more likely, no ears at all.
Although they might summarily reject them, studies show 
that conservative positions on major social issues look less fa-vorable with each passing day. The Pew Research Center just 
released a study on the millennial generation and its political 
views. This generation tends to identify as independents but lean Democratic — the party most often identiﬁ  ed with liber-als. This generation is less religious than its older peers, and the majority of millennials supports gay rights.
Why is it important for conservatives change their tune — 
or at least adjust their tune — on many major social issues?
Votes.Conservatives believe — as all ideologies do — that they 
have the right beliefs for our country to succeed; yet younger voters reject those core beliefs. If conservatives want to win the White House in 2016, they need a message they can sell to a majority of the country. Hoping the same trite message of social conservatism inspires enough voters to knock a more liberal, Democratic candidate like Hillary Clinton from her path to the White House, conservatives continue to bash the LGBT community, immigration reform and almost every-thing accomplished by President Barack Obama.  
Based on what happened at 
CPAC, it appears that conserva-tives once again have a message 
that appeals to a signiﬁ  cant group 
of voters but not one large enough to put a conservative Republican in the White House.
The portion of the American 
electorate comprised of millennials and minority voters con-tinues to grow, and conservative messages are less appealing to those groups. Think about this: 80 percent of minority vot-ers cast ballots for Obama in 2012. Their numbers in the elec-
torate are only going to grow, and there is no way a growing 
portion of the electorate will ever cast a ballot in favor of a conservative candidate if large conventions of conservatives demonize minority groups.
A whopping 67 percent of the youth vote — who continue 
to trend Democratic and liberal — cast ballots for Obama in 2012, and 50 percent of eligible voters 18-29 years old, voted.
To my conservative friends: What’s your strategy for win-
ning an increasingly important and growing portion of the 
American electorate?
From what I heard at CPAC last week, the strategy is stay 
the course, and the votes will come.
In gerrymandered congressional districts throughout the 
country, that philosophy may work quite well. A district 
made up of mostly conservative Republicans will certainly send conservative Republicans to Washington, D.C., but those conservative Republicans will end up having to work with — or against — a fairly moderate Democratic presi-
dent.
Conservatives seem deathly afraid of a Clinton presiden-
cy in 2016. 
If they continue this “stay the course” mentality and don’t 
adjust their views to meet a changing country, their worst 
dreams may very well come true.

Mayor Braddy out of touch with interns, 
residents
Mayor Ed Braddy’s recent pledge to “re-
vamp” the City of Gainesville internship pro-
gram is nothing new. I interned for the City of Gainesville in the summer of 2011 and did much more than “shadow the City Commis-
sion,” as Braddy claimed in the Feb. 26 edition 
of the Alligator.
My fellow interns and I did signiﬁ  cant 
amount of independent research, toured city facilities, met with city staff and learned a sig-niﬁ  cant amount about public policy and urban planning. I never felt unwelcome in City Hall and never saw the student voice ignored while working with Democratic commissioners.
In fact, the worst treatment of students has 
always come from local Republicans like Ed Braddy, who have continually proposed scal-ing back transit options for students, opposed environmental protections and LGBT rights initiatives that students overwhelmingly sup-
port and fought against using the Reitz Union 
as an early vote location. 
Braddy’s claim that he’s the ﬁ  rst to “give 
students an idea of how their local govern-ment works and give them an opportunity to participate in a more hands-on manner” is, frankly, disrespectful to every hard-working student who has interned or participated in our City Government. 
It’s part of a pattern for this mayor: He’s 
out of touch with the priorities of the average citizen.

UF alumna and a political organizer Don’t blame the bag — recycle
That darn plastic bag! It’s in trouble again. Apparently, it has jumped out of some-
one’s hand or escaped from the car and yelled, “I’m out of here, and I am going to litter the 
beach, the park or the highway!”
Well, we shouldn’t blame the plastic bag 
simply because a person didn’t dispose of it 
properly.
Instead of blaming the bag, let’s remind 
our friends, family and neighbors to recycle their plastic bags. 
Not sure where to take your plastic bags — 
no problem! 
Many retailers will take them back. For example, your local Publix has a con-
venient receptacle right at the entrance, so you can drop them off. 
Plastic bags are then recycled and made 
into items like shopping baskets or planters. 
To ﬁ  nd other locations go to abagslife.
com and then click on the “Find the Location” icon.  
You will ﬁ  nd several other retailers who 
will be happy to take the plastic bags back and recycle them.
Make sure you recycle the plastic bags at 
your business, too. 
So let’s stop blaming the plastic bag for lit-
tering. 
Instead, let’s give that plastic bag a new 
life.

How was your Spring Break? Meet anyone fun? Get a tan? Learn how to perform oral sex from your phone?
Lick This, an app released this week, supposedly 
teaches users just that. The app is available on your 
mobile browser at lickthisapp.com, so you don’t even 
have to download anything and potentially explain to someone that you need an app to learn how to per-form oral sex. 
The app speciﬁ  cally focuses on going down on the 
ladies. There are three different exercises that suppos-edly increase cunnilingus skills. Because, you know, your ability to bounce a beach ball with your tongue directly correlates to your ability to make a girl or-
gasm. 
Now, let’s state the obvious — ew. 
I know exactly how many bars and frat houses my 
phone has been in, and I can say with certainty that there is no way I’m putting my tongue on it unless it’s thoroughly covered in plastic wrap, which the app creator actually suggests. 
Even if I were guaranteed not to catch something, 
this is still ignoring the fact that, let’s face it, my iP-
hone screen is nothing like a vulva. 
The ﬂ  at glass screen doesn’t compare to the warm 
skin of a lady, nor can it give me feedback. 
I asked a friend of mine who has more experi-
ence performing cunnilingus if he could tell me his 
thoughts. He said that the app is entertaining but not actually helpful because females all want different things.
Some want more pressure, some want a lighter 
touch, and some want you to go faster. But according to the app, as long as you can sharpen a pencil with your tongue, you’re an oral sex wizard.
This is the biggest problem with sex apps. Sure, 
they’re fun, but they aren’t a substitute for the real deal.
If you want to learn how to improve your oral sex 
ability, ﬁ  nd a willing partner to practice on. They can probably give you better tips because they, you know, 
can actually talk to you. This applies to any sex-
related app. Apps like Tin-
der and Grindr are popular for ﬁ  nding hook-ups, but what’s wrong with doing 
that in person? 
It’s cool that I can meet 
hot singles in my area from 
the comfort of my home — and from the comfort of 
my pajamas — but we’re in college, guys! Go to a club or a party. Talk to that cute person in your class. 
Don’t get me wrong: I do get the appeal. I’m never 
separated from technology for more than a few hours. 
I sleep with my phone under my pillow, and, to be 
honest, I’m already practically dating my computer.
These apps interest us as millennials because we 
already rely on technology for so much. 
However, I think that relying on it for interpersonal 
relationships, which sex very much is, is dangerous.
Tech-based sex is a good way to bring up the con-
versation and make sex more mainstream, but I think ultimately it detracts from the personal intimacy that 
is sex. 
How are you going to get to know someone, emo-
tionally or physically, if you spend all your time star-
ing at your phone screen? 
If you are unsure of your oral sex ability, or any-
thing sexual for that matter, discuss that with your partner rather than turning to an app. 
If we as a society aren’t careful about our tech-
nological improvements, use of these apps will turn 
straight into a scene from “Her.” Imagine walking in 
on your signiﬁ  cant other going down on his or her phone, but for real and not just for instruction. 
If Lick This interests you and you do choose to get 
intimate with your phone, remember to use protec-tion. Lay down some plastic wrap and make sure your device has a virus blocker — you don’t want to catch anything.

The Florida Legislature is attempting to seize total control of Lake Okeechobee, eliminating the U.S. Army Corps of En-
gineers from the process and giving total wa-ter management control to the South Florida 
Water Management District. This proposal is 
a bad idea, as it overlooks the history of the management of the lake and related water bodies in regard to the Clean Water Act.
First, Florida petitioned the federal gov-
ernment for the construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike and the Central & Southern Flood Control Project to provide ﬂ  ood relief and water-supply sources for agricultural 
and urban development. This expensive ef-
fort, in conjunction with navigation projects for the Kissimmee, St. Lucie and Caloosa-hatchee rivers, resulted in a fair-weather water management system that is unable to adapt to increasingly common drought and ﬂ  ood conditions.  
SFWMD managed water for 
the beneﬁ  t of agriculture and ur-ban water supplies — a reason-able effort until it abandoned any 
concept of environmental water supplies for 
estuaries or preserved wetland systems such as Everglades National Park.  Additionally, public waters were allowed to be degraded by the actions of public agencies that were supposed to be adhering to the provisions of the CWA.  
Eventually, the deterioration reached such 
extremes that the federal government sued 
Florida to prevent further degradation and re-
store national resources.  The lawsuit dragged on for years until former Gov. Lawton Chiles symbolically surrendered the state’s sword.  The parties agreed to a restoration plan call-ing for cost sharing and joint consultation in management.  This is where we are, or should be, today.
Unfortunately, in the years of 
bad lake management, water lev-els were allowed to reach heights 
for water supply purposes that led to dete-rioration of the Dike. As a result, the Corps had to institute new regulation schedules to protect the Dike’s primary purpose of ﬂ  ood prevention. Additionally, SFWMD practiced favoritism for water supply deliveries while shunting ﬂ  ood waters to communities that were not normally in the lake’s ﬂ  ood zones.  Only in these last few years have these ad-
versely affected communities on the east and 
west sides of the lake able to get the Corps to consider their needs, often contrary to SF-WMD recommendations.
The quality of the environment is key to 
the economies of east- and west-coast com-munities. Without the creative tension of the state-federal partnership, both partners re-ceiving input from affected parties, that one agency will be swayed to the interests of fa-vored stakeholders and lobbyists, to the detri-
ment of the other stakeholders, notably the si-
lent stakeholder: nature.  Trying to co-opt the federal role in management while expecting the federal dollars indicates that the lessons of the lawsuit have been forgotten.  
West-coast needs have not been addressed 
except through temporary and discretionary relief, and we need equitable attention from both partners. Eliminating one will only re-
sult in further harm to our communities, our 
economies and our environments.

opinions@alligator.org Bitcoin, deﬁ  ned 
as a “peer-to-peer technol-
ogy,” was designed for the purpose of 
making digital transactions with-
out the presence of a banking authority. The open software is available to everyone, and it’s run with the use of cryptography to control the exchange of funds. But with the recent embroilment of one of the network’s central hosts, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, in a $409 
million loss of investments, most 
economists may not want to get involved.
A “massive hack” is rumored 
to be the cause of customer out-rage following the shutdown of Mt. Gox’s site on Feb. 25. Also at this time, the Mt. Gox Tokyo ofﬁ  ce was seemingly deserted by its em-
ployees. The following day, Mt. 
Gox chief executive Mark Karpe-les released a statement on the site for concerned capital investors.
With the inability to retrieve 
funds, many Mt. Gox users are left in the dark. When the site went ofﬂ  ine, a handful of protest-ers gathered outside the corpo-
ration’s Tokyo ofﬁ  ce, despite it 
being vacant, claiming they had suffered signiﬁ  cant losses in their virtual wallets. In a circulating document reported to be reﬂ  ec-tive of Mt. Gox’s real position, more than 
744,000 Bitcoins were missing due to relentless cyber attacks over the expanse of several years.
Although many are infuriated 
by Bitcoin’s present instability, some have chalked up the down-turn as just another crash, to be ex-pected of “high-risk investments.” Hopefully, the standstill Mt. Gox 
is undergoing will foster the “so-
lutions” it claims to be working toward. This extensive breach should serve as a warning to those choosing to invest in virtual cur-rency, as this technological era births new loopholes for danger.
The Commodity Futures Trad-
ing Commission is now contem-
plating the establishment of rules 
for Bitcoin’s digital trading. Feder-al prosecutors in New York have subpoenaed Mt. Gox. Japanese authorities are also reported to be looking into the matter. There’s no telling what will become of Mt. Gox’s future and the millions lost to its investors.

The Allen H. Neuharth

made signiﬁ  cant contributions 
to the college.
The room will replace the 
original library on the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor 
of Weimer Hall, which was also 
named after Neuharth. Furni-
ture from the original library has been washed and will be placed in the new room.“It’s great because hopeful-

room in size and display, he 
said. 
There will be a big screen TV 
streaming live news, as well as local and national newspapers 
and magazines for students to 
peruse.

KEY LARGO — President Ba-
rack Obama got out on a Florida 
golf course Saturday with two for-mer professional athletes and the cousin of one of his top advisers.
Obama’s foursome included 
Ahmad Rashad, Cyrus Walker and Alonzo Mourning, the White House said.
Rashad is a sportscaster and 
former NFL wide receiver. Mourn-ing is a former center for the NBA’s Miami Heat who has helped raise money for Obama’s campaigns. 
Later this month, Obama is sched-
uled to headline a fundraiser for the House Democrats’ campaign arm at Mourning’s Miami home.Mourning is also helping the 
administration promote Obama’s new health care law. He played golf with Obama in Florida last 
November.
Walker is a cousin of Obama se-
nior adviser Valerie Jarrett.
Obama, his wife, Michelle, and 
daughters Malia and Sasha, arrived 
Friday afternoon at the Ocean Reef Club for a weekend getaway. The private, by-invitation-only mem-bership club has two champion-
ship 18-hole golf courses.
White House spokesman Josh 
Earnest said Obama was looking 
forward to some warm-weather downtime with his family.
Before escaping the cold weath-
er in Washington, Obama recorded his weekly radio and Internet ad-dress. In the message, Obama said he’s hearing from business owners across the country who are volun-
tarily paying their workers more 
than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.
Congressional Republicans are 
resisting Obama’s pleas to raise the wage to $10.10 an hour, saying it will lead employers to eliminate jobs.
In the Republican address, Ohio 
Sen. Rob Portman says Obama’s proposed 2015 budget taxes too much and spends too much. Port-man says Senate Republicans have a plan to spark economic recovery by getting government out of the way.

� THE PLANE’S WING GOT TANGLED IN 
PARACHUTE STRINGS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MULBERRY, Fla. — A plane became entangled 
in the strings of a skydiver’s parachute sending both 
crashing into the ground near Tampa and both the pilot and jumper to the hospital with minor injuries.
Polk County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce spokeswoman Car-
rie Eleazer said 87-year-old pilot Shannon Trembley was doing takeoff and landing maneuvers Saturday in his Cessna at the South Lakeland Airport in Mul-berry.
On his third landing pass, the wing of his plane 
became entangled in the strings of 49-year-old Gainesville skydiver John Frost’s parachute about 75 feet above the ground.
Frost was ﬂ  ung to the ground, and Trembley’s 
plane nose-dived to the surface.
Eleazer says neither sustained serious injury, but 
both went to the hospital. Frost was treated and re-leased. Trembley was held for observation.Skydiver, pilot have midair accidentBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

The UF gymnastics 
team defeated WVU in its last home meet. Read the story online at alligatorSports.org.Poll question
Will the No. 1 seed Gators win this weekend’s Southeastern Conference Tournament? Vote online 
at alligatorSports.org.LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
After No. 1 Florida sealed an 
84-65 win against No. 25 Kentucky 
in the O’Connell Center on Satur-
day, senior forward Will Yeguete 
hoisted a sign that read “18-0 and more to go.”
Following the victory, Flori-
da’s seniors made sure to relish their achievements — a list that includes the only 18-0 record in Southeastern Conference history, the winningest regular season 
in program history (29-2), their 
third outright SEC regular-season championship in four seasons and 23 straight wins. 
First, they cut down the nets 
with their teammates and coach-
es. Once the ladder climbing was 
done, seniors Casey Prather, Scot-tie Wilbekin, Patric Young and Yeguete kneeled down and kissed 
the Gators logo at center court.
It was a coordinated celebra-
tion by the Gators for their most 
successful senior class in school history. 
“We’ve been accomplishing a 
lot of things this year, but that’s just a result from hard work and everything we’ve invested from 
early this year,” Young said. 
“This is the fruit of all that hard 
work.”
Added coach Billy Donovan: “This is the greatest regular sea-son I’ve ever been a part of.”
Despite a strong first-half 
showing, Saturday’s win did not 
come easily for the Gators.Entering the half with a 49-28 
advantage, Florida shot 61.5 per-cent from the field — including a 7-of-12 clip from three-point range — and forced Kentucky (22-9, 12-6 SEC) to 34.8 percent shoot-
ing and 11 turnovers.
But coming out of halftime, the 
Florida defeats Kentucky to close out perfect SEC season

Ole Miss right-hander Carly Hum-
mel could not slow down the Gators on 
Sunday.
After handing Florida its first shutout 
loss on Friday since the Gators’ 3-0 loss 
to Texas on June 2, 2013, in the Women’s 
College World Series, the Rebels senior fell flat in Game 3 of UF’s first Southeast-ern Conference series of the season.The No. 1 
Gators (24-1, 2-1 SEC) plated six 
hits from six dif-
ferent batters as they topped the Rebels 
2-0 on Sunday at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium to take the series.

The Gators have struggled to hit for 
power throughout non-conference play this 
season, but they needed a couple big hits to 
secure their first series sweep of 2014.
On the backs of only its second home run 
and third triple of the season, Florida (10-6) 
defeated Connecticut (4-8) in extra innings 
for the third straight game, needing an extra 
frame of baseball to scrape across the final run in its 6-5 win at McKethan Stadium on Sunday.
“I think today was our best offensive day 
of the year,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
After taking the lead on two separate oc-casions in the first four in-nings, the Gators fell behind 
5-4 in the sixth and looked 
like they would continue the run-averse trend that has befallen them for much of this season. After los-
ing its lead, UF went 0 for 
4 with runners in scoring 
position through the next four innings.
Luckily for Florida, its pitchers kept it 
in the game. After two games in which the 
staff gave up one run combined, the pitchers struggled a little more on Sunday but kept the game within reach.UF sweeps UConn in extras

“I’m going to take a shower with it and everything.” 
Casey Prather  
UF forward on the O’Connell Center net the team cut down
“It was good. They put up a good 
fight. They’re a good team, but it 
was just an overall great team effort on our part.”
Added coach Tim Walton: 
“Against a good pitcher, when you find a way to score, you’ve got to do it and take advantage of some op-portunities.”
That’s exactly what Florida did.With the game scoreless in the 
fourth inning, Tofft blasted her fourth home run of the season to center field to give the Gators a 1-0 
advantage.
“I thought it was kind of a pop-
up, but I was hustling, too, just in 
case she dropped it,” the third base-man said. “But it ended up going over, so it worked out.”
One inning later, freshman Chel-
sea Herndon — making just her sixth start of the season — hit a lead-
off home run to right field to wrap 
up the scoring for Florida.
“Chelsea did a great job coming 
up the next inning and keeping it going, not just letting us go flat after one run,” Tofft said. “She kept it go-ing a little bit, even if it was only one more run. She did a really good job staying on it and driving one.”
While Florida was able to gener-
ate production at the plate, Delanie Gourley made sure Ole Miss (15-9, 1-2 SEC) remained stagnant in her first conference start. The freshman left-hander threw a three-hit com-plete game shutout, logging four strikeouts while walking only two batters.
“I was just really excited and 
ready to go,” Gourley said. 
“This morning, I was just prepar-
ing myself and I was like, ‘Hey, it’s my first start. I’m just going to show them what I have and pitch how I know how.’”
To close out the series, Walton 
utilized a different lineup than he has used all season. 
Herndon and junior Briana Little, 
who have mostly contributed from the bench, started in right and left field, respectively. Freshman Justine McLean moved from her usual spot in left field to center.
Herndon and Little have thrived 
in their minimal playing time this season. 
Herndon is batting .348 and has 
a .652 slugging clip to go along with seven RBIs and nine runs. 
Little leads the team with a .609 
on-base percentage and has a .333 clip at the plate. Against the Reb-els on Sunday, the Middleburg na-tive made it to base each time she stepped up to the plate.
“We’ve got to find a way to get 
Chelsea in the lineup, and that was the way to do that,” Walton said. “Obviously, taking Bailey [Castro] out, Bri goes into the lineup because you can’t play them both.”
In the infield, sophomore Kirsti 
Merritt took the start at second base, while Kelsey Stewart moved from 
second to shortstop over regular 
starter Katie Medina.
“I took Katie out and tried to get 
a little more production out of our offense,” Walton said. 
“What we’re trying to do is just 
find a way to put the best team on the field on that given day to win the game.”
Making his fourth start 
of the season, redshirt junior 
Karsten Whitson lasted only 
3.1 innings and gave up three 
runs, but the seven pitch-ers who relieved him went a combined 6.2 innings while 
giving up only two runs.
“This should be a big con-
fidence boost for a lot of guys 
out of the pen,” O’Sullivan said. “You can’t create this 
type of environment during 
practice. This should build character.”
By the ninth, the entire 
lineup had cycled through and struggled to string enough hits together to plate the tying run. But in that in-ning, they needed only one 
hit.
After first baseman Peter 
Alonso flew out to begin the 
inning, catcher Taylor Gush-
ue launched an 0-1 pitch well 
past the left-field bleachers. Instead of landing in an out-fielder’s glove — like most of UF’s deep fly balls — it 
bounced off a car windshield, 
shattering both the glass and UConn’s lead. 
“I was hoping it was gone, 
because I did a little bat flip,” Gushue said. “I kind of watched it a little bit. About three-quarters of the way there, I knew it was going to 
stay fair.”
Added O’Sullivan: “That 
was a big-time at-bat from a 
big-time player.”
The Gators could not capi-
talize on getting the winning run on in the ninth after left fielder Justin Shafer reached base due to an error, but they were almost forced to score in the 10th.
Third baseman Josh To-
bias, who came into the game batting .212, knocked his sec-ond hit of the game — a hard 
triple to left-center field.
With a runner on third and 
no outs, Florida was poised 
to score and end the game quickly, but it needed three 
batters.
Center fielder Buddy Reed 
lined out softly to second 
baseman Vinny Siena, who 
was playing in to stop the run-
ner from scoring on a ground ball. Shortstop Richie Martin followed, working a 3-2 count before walking.
Second baseman Casey 
Turgeon came up next. He had already grounded into one double play in the game, 
and O’Sullivan was deter-
mined for that not to happen again.
Turgeon attempted a 
squeeze drag bunt. It went 
foul. Although the element 
of surprise was gone, Tur-geon dropped down another. This time, it stayed inside the 
line as Tobias raced toward 
home. 
UConn first baseman Bob-
by Melley fielded the rolling ball, but Tobias was already 
crossing the plate. 
Melley didn’t even attempt 
a throw.
“We’re starting to break 
out a little bit,” Gushue said. 
“Bats are getting hot. Pitchers are absolutely carving up the other hitters.”MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 13

Seniors score 31 of 35 second-half points
Wildcats clawed their way back into contention.
Thanks to a 15-0 run by UK, UF saw itself ahead 
by only six points after leading by as many as 22 pre-
viously. Donovan thought the Gators entered half-
time drained. 
“I knew Kentucky was going to make a run,” he 
said. “They’re too talented not to. Give them credit 
— they battled and fought their way back in there. 
“I thought we got spread out on defense and 
played into their hands a little bit, in terms of open-
ing up driving gaps for them and them getting the 
ball at the front of the rim offensive rebounding.”
With its back against the wall, Florida needed a 
spark. Then, the seniors came to the rescue. 
Prather, Wilbekin, Yeguete and Young scored 
all but four of UF’s 35 points in the second half and made key shots down the stretch to finish the game 
on a 19-8 run.
“Like we’ve always done this year, we just tried 
to fight through and weather the storm,” Wilbekin 
said.
During the game’s final 12 minutes, Prather 
scored 10 points, Yeguete threw down an open two-
handed flush, Young sunk a hook shot and Wilbekin 
drained two three-pointers.
His final attempt from beyond the arc iced the 
game to put the Gators ahead 77-60 with 2:33 left.
“Once he hit that one,” Young said, “we all knew 
it was over.”Young finished with a game-high 18 points on 
8-of-13 shooting, while Prather made all five of his 
shots for 15 points. Wilbekin added 13 points and four assists.
The No. 1 seed Gators now have four days to re-
gain focus and prepare for their first game in the SEC Tournament on Friday at 1 p.m. in Atlanta against either No. 8 seed Missouri or ninth-seeded Texas A&M.
Saturday, Florida reveled in the moment. Now, 
the Gators are ready to regain focus on what’s ahead.
“Would you say this is mission accomplished? 
My answer is no,” Young said. “We’re in the right 
direction right now. The ultimate goal is to be na-
tional champions.
“We can say, ‘Yeah, we accomplished something,’ 
but the sun’s hopefully going to come back up to-morrow, and then we’ve got to get back to work.”hooPS , from page 12

Sophomore Gordon Watson show-
cased his skills Sunday when he de-
feated No. 55 ranked Tsvetan Mihov in three sets to clinch Florida’s 4-2 win against South Carolina at the Ring Ten-
nis Complex on Sunday. 
After falling to Texas A&M 2-4 in 
College Station, Texas, on Feb. 28, Flor-
ida looked forward to Sunday to tilt its 5-5 record above .500. Both the Gators and Gamecocks ﬁ  nished with a 7-5 re-cord in Southeastern Conference play last season, leaving the teams in a tie for the third spot. 
On the doubles court, Florida’s 
No. 9 duo of Elliot Orkin and Gordon Watson fell to Chip Cox and Tsvetan Mihov 8-5. Senior tandem Mike Alford and Florent Diep were defeated in a tough 8-6 decision by Andrew Adams and Kyle Koch, giving South Carolina the doubles point and a 1-0 lead. 
But in singles, the Gators got off to 
a great start. 
Diep was ﬁ  rst to win for the Gators. He defeated Adams in a quick 6-1, 6-2 decision to tie the match at 1. 
Diego Hidalgo gave Florida a 2-1 
lead over South Carolina when he de-feated Thiago Pinheiro  in two sets, 6-4, 6-1. 
USC began to rally back when Chip 
Cox defeated Mike Alford in straight sets, 4-6, 6-7, tying the match at 2.
But Orkin gave the Gators the ad-
vantage, defeating Andrew Schafer in three sets, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4. 
“Orkin has been through a lot,” as-
sistant coach Mark Merklein said in a release. “He wasn’t playing, and all of a sudden, he’s put into the SEC scene 
in a battle down there.” 
Watson’s match was a roller coaster 
ride. After winning his ﬁ  rst set 6-1 with 
ease against doubles opponent Mihov, he dropped his second set 6-4. With the match on the line, he found a second wind and won the ﬁ  nal set 6-3. 
Next up for Florida (6-5, 1-1 SEC) is 
a match against Tennessee on Friday at 
5 p.m. in Gainesville. 
“We look to build conﬁ  dence and 
ingrain a certain identity into our 
team,” Merklein said. “We’re young and we’re, in my mind, trying to be the best team in the SEC.”Sophomore clinches comeback win against Gamecocks� FLORIDA DEFEATED MISSISSIPPI

After two games in as many days, fifth-
seeded Florida was bounced from the 
Southeastern Conference Tournament by No. 12 Kentucky on Friday following a strong showing against Mississippi State on 
Thursday. 
After earning a first-round bye, the Gators 
faced off against the Bulldogs for the second 
time this season. 
The first time the teams met — in 
Gainesville on Jan. 2. — Florida came out 
with an 82-72 win.
The results were similar the second time 
around, with the Gators winning again on 
Thursday, 71-67. 
A strong first half propelled Florida to 
victory, thanks to a 59.3 percent shooting effort in the half, not to mention outscoring Mississippi State 22-8 in the paint. 
The Bulldogs rallied back in the second 
half, but thanks to the efforts of senior Ja-
terra Bonds and redshirt junior Kayla Lewis, 
the Gators held on to advance to the quar-terfinals. 
Lewis recorded 17 points, six boards and 
five blocks against Mississippi State. 
“I think that Kayla’s athleticism is what 
you see because that’s the most obvious thing,” coach Amanda Butler said. “That’s much more about Kayla’s desire, the plays that she made. That’s what makes me proud of those numbers. It’s not, ‘Can she jump 
higher than someone or is she stronger than 
someone?’ It’s about, ‘I’m not going to be denied, I’m not going to let you score on this.’ It comes from a positive, team-oriented place.”The Gators didn’t have much time to 
relish in their win against the Bulldogs, as a matchup against the Wildcats in the quar-terfinals was a mere 24 hours later. 
Florida enjoyed success against Ken-
tucky in the regular season, winning both contests 83-73 and 86-80 in Lexington, Ky., and Gainesville, respectively. 
Fortunately for the Wildcats, the SEC 
Tournament offered another chance for re-demption, and they took advantage of it de-spite a strong first half by the Gators.
Florida went 5 for 10 from beyond the 
arc, and Lewis had another strong showing, scoring a team-high 11 points in the half. 
Unfortunately for the Gators, there was 
an extra 20 minutes they had to play. 
After entering halftime down by seven 
with the score 36-29, the Wildcats stormed back. 
With 8:35 remaining in the game, Florida 
lost its lead and never regained it, despite later tying the game at 70 with only 1:29 re-maining on the clock.
Florida saw its lead dwindle away thanks 
to a strong rebounding effort from Kentucky, who won by five points in the 75-70 affair. 
The Wildcats doubled up the Gators in 
offensive boards, 18-9.
Against Mississippi State, Florida was 
also badly outrebounded on the offensive side, but the Bulldogs’ inability to capitalize in the paint allowed the Gators to hang on. 
 “The rebounding battle, one of our goals 
is to neutralize that,” Butler said. “We’re trying to always scratch around and make 
plays off the boards as much as we can. We 
didn’t do a good job with that. In the second 
half, that was really what was keeping them afloat. I thought we were playing great bas-ketball, but kept giving them second chanc-es. A good team’s going to take advantage of that.”

Diving hasn’t been one of the strengths for 
Florida’s No.1 men’s (8-0, 5-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) or No. 8 women’s (5-3, 3-2 SEC) swim-ming and diving teams in recent years. 
But the Gators will have a chance to qualify 
a diver for the NCAA Championships at to-day’s Zone ‘B’ Diving Regional Championships in Greensboro, N.C., for the first time since Mi-chael Lewark competed for the men in 2012 and Monica Dodson was part of the 2011 women’s national championship.
Redshirt senior Chris Jones’ return has helped 
the men’s diving effort in the second half of the season. Jones finished a team best on the plat-
form and 1-meter springboard at SECs in Feb-
ruary; however, none of Florida’s men made an event final.
But the women’s team has had more success. 
Sophomore Kahlia Warner qualified for finals on the 1- and 3-meter springboards at SECs, coming in fifth on the latter event, and has been a consis-tent point scorer all season.
“Our confidence level is high,” diving coach 
Donnie Craine said. “Now it is just a matter of going into this meet and competing to the best of their abilities.
“One of the things that I encourage them to 
thing about is diving for themselves, because there are not team points for this event.”Florida’s roster boasts six divers — three on 
each side — heading into the regional champion-ships with a field of nearly 70 divers — around 40 athletes for the women and about 30 divers for the men.
They will all be competing for a little more 
than a handful of spots. Only seven male divers and nine female divers will advance to the na-tional championship meet.
“This is an opportunity for the divers to get to 
the NCAA Championships,” Craine said. “It is a very competitive competition.”
If the Gators can qualify a diver, he or she 
will join either the 14 swimmers on the women’s team in Minneapolis, Minn., on March 20-22, or the men’s team a week later in Austin, Texas.
Both squads have qualified all five relays, but 
the men’s NCAA Championships meet list of in-vited swimmers won’t be released until March 19. The most swimmers a team can qualify is 17.Florida looks to qualify divers

On Feb. 21, 2007, the Gators cut 
down the nets in the O’Connell 
Center to celebrate their Southeast-ern Conference title despite having three more regular season games on the schedule. 
They lost their next two games.“I regret that,” coach Billy Dono-
van said after being put in a striking-ly similar situation nine days ago.
Florida entered its matchup with LSU on March 1 with the SEC’s best record already sewn up, but Dono-van wasn’t going to make the same mistake he made seven years earlier by celebrating prematurely.
“To me, when you cut down a 
net, that’s ﬁ  nality,” Donovan said in the March 1 postgame press confer-ence. “There’s still two games left, so there’s no ﬁ  nality right now.” 
But on Saturday, Florida ﬁ  nalized 
its regular season, ﬁ  nishing 18-0 in league play. And in the words of the four seniors being honored in their ﬁ  nal home game, it was perfect.
When Kentucky cut its 21-point 
halftime deﬁ  cit to just six with 12:24 in the second half, Scottie Wilbekin sunk a three to extend the Gators’ lead to nine.
Six minutes later, Patric Young 
broke out of his 16-minute scoreless streak to bring his team’s lead back to double digits.
Casey Prather’s contested layup 
30 seconds afterward resulted in a three-point play, padding the ad-vantage.
And then Will Yeguete joined 
the party with his fourth dunk of the year, sending the bench and the crowd into a frenzy.
The Gators’ four-man senior class 
ﬁ  nished the contest by recording 31 of the team’s ﬁ  nal 35 points.
“This is the way to go out,” 
Young said. “You cannot script it any better.”
But Florida’s fairytale ﬁ  nale to 
its most successful regular season in school history almost never came to fruition.
Wilbekin, whose 12.9 points per 
game and 2.1 assist-to-turnover ratio make him a leading candidate for 
SEC Player of the Year, was given 
the opportunity to transfer by Dono-van after being suspended twice for violating team rules.
Prather said switching schools 
crossed his mind after struggling with injuries and limited playing time during his early years at Flor-ida. Young had to battle to ﬁ  nd his 
identity amid the downpour of criti-
cisms and comparisons.
And Donovan said he was con-
cerned Yeguete wouldn’t even have a senior season because of his offsea-son surgery on his right knee.“When you invest four years 
like these guys have invested, it means something to them,” Dono-van said. “They’re going to carry it with them for the rest of their lives. They’ve done something that has 
not happened here before and has 
not happened in our league before. To me, there were a lot of emotions and I’m proud of the way they han-dled themselves leading up to this game.”
When Donovan handed Wil-
bekin a framed jersey during the pre-game festivities, the point guard said if it had gone on for just a few more seconds, he would have shed a tear.
“I thought all of us were going to 
cry, actually,” Prather said. 
“I’m surprised no one [did]. I 
knew if one of us started crying, then everybody was going to bust out crying.”
