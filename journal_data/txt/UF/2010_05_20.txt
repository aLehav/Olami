Clearwater man arrested for soliciting prostitute in presence of 8-year-old boy
CLEARWATER — A Clearwater man 
has been charged with picking up a pros-
titute and taking drugs while he had an 8-year-old boy in his vehicle.
Police say 37-year-old Joseph L. Marti-
nez took the boy Saturday evening without the knowledge of the child's mother and then returned him about six hours later.
It's not clear how Martinez knew the 
8-year-old.Police didn't say whether Martinez en-
gaged in sex acts with the woman in the child's presence.
Martinez was arrested and charged Sun-
day with battery, lewd and lascivious ex-hibition, disorderly conduct, child neglect and interference with custody. 
He was being held on $20,400 bail.

Kofi Adu-Brempong, the 35-year-old Ghanaian graduate stu-
dent who was shot in the face by University Police in March, re-
mains hospitalized and in stable condition, his sister-in-law Cyn-
thia Agyemang said Wednesday.
“His spirits are up,” she said, “[he’s] hopeful that things will 
turn around in his favor.”
Agyemang said the family is not anxiously awaiting the up-
coming release of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s 
official report on the matter, but simply said, “We’re at peace.”
On March 2, UPD officers responded to a worried neighbor’s 
call who heard screaming from Adu-Brempong’s on-campus Cor-ry Village apartment, according to UPD reports.
Police officers, along with a mental health professional, visited 
Adu-Brempong the day before the shooting and arrest because a professor from his college expressed concern for his mental stabil-ity. The officers concluded, however, that Adu-Brempong was not a danger to himself or others, the report stated.
The night of the incident, Adu-Brempong would not allow 
police officers into his home. Officers were forced to talk to him Grad student

� ROBERTS WAS ACCUSED OF 
SUPPORTING STUDENTS' HAITI TRIP.

Alligator Staff Writer
UF has cleared professor Churchill Roberts 
of violating university policy by allowing two 
graduate students to return to Haiti to com-plete a video project.
According to a statement released Wednes-
day by members of UF’s human resources de-partment, the investigation, which was intend-ed to determine whether Roberts “authorized or facilitated” use of university funds for the trip, concluded Roberts did nothing wrong.
Roberts, who specializes in video journal-
ism, is the thesis adviser for Jonathan Bougher and Roman Safuillin, graduate students in the College of Journalism and Communications. Bougher and Safuillin were working on a film project in Haiti for their master’s-degree project 
before the earthquake struck in January.
In the weeks following the earthquake, UF 
implemented a safety policy that banned any 
university funding from being used to sponsor 
trips to Haiti.
According to the report, Rob-
erts knew his students were go-ing to return to Haiti to finish 
their project, but said he did not feel it was his 
responsibility to prevent them from going pro-
vided they did not use UF funds. 
The nearly 12-week investigation confirmed 
that Bougher and Safuillin funded their trip with private donations from people interested in their work. Investigation clears prof.CITY ELECTION ISSUES

Although Gainesville’s mayoral 
election took place 65 days ago and 
the runoff was 37 days ago, two lo-
cals have gone to court saying more voting needs to be done because Craig Lowe might not be the win-ner.
Mason Alley and Phil Courson, 
supporters of second-place finisher Don Marsh, are hoping to prove the city needs a special election because 
of uncertainty about the voter reg-
istration of 44 voters.
Sarah Rumpf, attorney for Alley and Courson, said she has evidence to suspect there are people who 
voted in the election who live and 
work in other counties, states and 
countries.
After produc-
ing a list of the 44 
people in court 
Tuesday, Rumpf 
motioned to file an amended com-
plaint stating the 
solution would 
be to hold a new election because it cannot be determined for whom 
those 44 people voted.Marsh supporters

Women allegedly try to 
smuggle meth inside Bible 
LIVINGSTON, La. — Two 
women have been arrested for 
allegedly attempting to smuggle crystal methamphetamine inside a Bible to a Walker man jailed in 
the Livingston Parish Detention 
Center. Sheriff’s deputies told The Advocate that a 28-year-old woman allegedly delivered a Bible containing methamphet-amine to the detention center on May 12. They said a 35-year-old woman allegedly gave the Bible to the jailed man.
The intended recipient, a 
30-year-old man, has been in jail since October on a variety of drug-related arrests.
The man was booked with 
entering contraband into a penal institution, and the 35-year-old woman was booked with being a principal to entering contraband 
into a penal institution.

farm were left on the lawn of a high school with “2010” painted on their sides in an apparent prank.
Schools Superintendent Mi-
chael Nutter says the 3-day-old lambs were not harmed by their visit Tuesday morning to Green High School, about 40 miles south of Cleveland. But he warns that the culprits won’t pull the wool over anyone’s eyes.
School administrators are re-

Nutter isn’t saying how they

It’s like a graduation. She’s sad 
about some things – her friend-
ships and experiences – but she’s glad to be starting a new phase, Pegeen Hanrahan said. 
She’s moving out of 
the mayor’s office today.  
     “With a job like being the may-or of your hometown, there are obviously a tremendous number 
of challenges and opportunities,” 
Hanrahan said Wednesday night. “There have been some really wonderful and uplifting circum-
stances.”
One such circumstance hap-
pens when citizens recognize 
Hanrahan, and they commend 
her for her job, she said.
“It’s especially moving to me 
when it’s a regular person, not 
someone with an interest with the city or a cog in the city ma-
chine,” Hanrahan said. 
During her six-year tenure 
in office, Hanrahan has done a lot of good, said Hanan Clarke, a 60-year-old who has been in 
Gainesville for 40 years and vot-ed for Hanrahan in both of her mayoral elections.
“She’s done a lot of great 
things,” said Clarke. “I’d like to 
see her stay involved.”
One of the highlights of Hanra-
han’s service was being selected 
by the White House to represent how American cities are promot-ing sustainability.
 Additionally, Hanrahan spoke 
at the Copenhagen Climate Con-ference last December. 
“Gainesville was used as an 
example of what cities are doing right by the White House,”  Han-
rahan said.
Also under Hanrahan’s watch, 
Gainesville Regional Utilities 
was named Energy Star’s partner 
of the year.
“Those are the kinds of thing 
that make you feel like it’s well-
spent time when you’re por-ing over a development plan at 
10:30 at night and you want to go 
home,” she said.
Hanrahan, a Gainesville-na-
tive with four degrees from UF, 
isn’t looking to leave her home-
town.
“The children are really ex-
cited I’ll be home,” she said. “My husband is more than excited be-
cause he has carried the burden of 
having two small children while I’m out until 9, 10, 11 o’clock two or three nights a week and travel-
ing 20 days a year, if not more.”
But Hanrahan has not ruled 
out future public service. She is 
keeping her eyes on Florida’s No-vember elections, which might 
open opportunities for her, she 
said.
As evidence to support her claims, 
Rumpf pointed out one of the 44 voters used the address of Salty Dog Saloon as his or her place of residence.
“We ask that the election results be set 
aside, and that the voter rolls be cleaned of these questionable voters,” Alley said.
Alley noted the issue was important be-
cause of the narrow election results.In the runoff election April 13, Craig 
Lowe defeated Don Marsh by 42 votes.
“We’re dealing with this because of the 
margin of victory,” he said. “I have nothing personal against Commissioner Lowe.”
Alachua County Circuit Judge Victor L. 
Hulslander will make a decision on how the case will move forward, if at all.
Cherie Fine, Lowe’s attorney, motioned 
that the case be thrown out.
Unless the judge orders otherwise, Lowe is scheduled to be sworn in at noon today.
Fine said she would not be surprised if that decision comes soon.
“It’s best for the city that there be a 
mayor and there be no cloud over who that mayor is,” she said.
Rumpf, who practices out of Winter 
Park and has commuted to get involved in the case, said she wants to make sure the political process is carried out fairly.
“Election law is a narrow area of the 
law,” Rumpf said. “It’s one of my pet is-sues.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 20, 2010

through his open bedroom window for about two and half 
hours before the he fell silent, the report stated.
Fearing that Adu-Brempong had done something to harm 
himself, officers forced their way into the apartment. 
When Adu-Brempong approached the officers, they fired 
two Tasers, which failed to connect, three rounds of bean-bag shots, which failed to subdue him, and two shots from an auto-matic rifle, the report stated.
Adu-Brempong, who suffered from polio as a child, was 
rushed to Shands at UF where he was placed under a false name and treated for his injuries. His condition is no longer critical, although he has lost part of his jaw and tongue. He is currently charged with one count of second-degree aggravated assault and one count of third-degree resisting arrest with vio-
lence, according to Alligator archives.
Since the shooting, three protests have been held on cam-
pus. The protesters have demanded, among other things, that 
the shooting officer, Keith Smith, be terminated and that all charges against Adu-Brempong be dropped.
The FDLE and UF have both conducted their own investi-
gations on the case. The FDLE report was completed in April and was turned over to the State Attorney’s Office for consider-ation. State Attorney Bill Cervone said that progress continues 
to be made, and that the report, along with his recommenda-Report not released

Three senators representing the 
Student Alliance party announced 
their new affiliation with the Progress Party after voicing their dissatisfac-tion with the policies of their former party.
Student Alliance party Sen. Alan 
Martin, who represents graduate stu-dents; Jose Soto, a summer replace-ment senator who represents graduate students; and Tim Johnson, a replace-ment senator for the College of Liber-al Arts and Sciences, cited campaign tactics and internal politics as their reasons for switching their party af-
filiation.
Martin said statements made by 
Student Alliance party members led 
him to believe the Student Alliance party was responsible for swastika fli-
ers distributed across campus in Feb-
ruary before the Student Government 
election.Martin also said he was led to be-
lieve Student Alliance party Sen. Gra-ham Clark was chosen by the party to appear on the ballot because he threat-ened to turn the party website into a pornographic website.
“I can’t prove any of this,” Martin 
said. “It is possible given everything I heard that there is a more innocent explanation. I just felt like I had to do something.”
Student Alliance party Senate 
leader Jonathan Ossip said any statements Mar-tin overheard 
were meant as sarcastic jokes. He denies the Student Alliance party had anything to do with the fliers or slated anyone who was undeserving. 
The Student Alliance party, which 
was formed when the Progress Par-ty and the Orange and Blue Party merged, is not splitting apart, Ossip said. 
Unite Party Sen. Ben Meyers, who represents the agricultural college, 
said his party has always worked well 
with the Progress Party. 
“We are definitely looking forward 
to working with Progress,” he said. 
“All of our senators are obviously 
on board with our policy and fight-ing for students’ rights, which is what 
we’re here for,” Ossip said.
Former Progress Party Sen. Dave 
Schneider said there are no definite 
plans to re-launch the Progress Party 
or put it on the SG ballot for the fall.
“We’re still taking it one step at a 
time,” Schneider said. 
During the meeting, senators also 
unanimously passed a resolution call-ing for the continued cleanup of the 
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and for 
more safety regulations that would prevent such a spill in the future.
Two additional agency directors 
were unanimously approved in the 
Senate. Andrew Fagin will be the 
new Student Government Productions director and Sara Makda will be the 
new director of Students Taking Ac-
tion Against Racism. Senators join Progress Party

oil spill ruined your beach plans?Power Struggle
The war between the 
states, or between one state and a growing 
list of cities, is starting to get heated.
Los Angeles decided to 
hop on the bandwagon and boycott official travel to Ari-zona because of the state’s controversial immigration law, which allows police to demand identification from anyone it suspects is in the country illegally. Arizona’s response: turn off LA’s  power.
The sprawling California 
city gets a sizable chunk of its power from Arizona, and if the state follows through with its threat it could end up being a long, hot summer for people living in the city.
We think the immigra-
tion law is little more than legally sanctioned racial pro-filing, but we are not so na-ive to think Arizona would ignore threats to its tourism economy. 
What bothers us is that 
Arizona officials seem more willing to dig their heels into the ground and fight back than consider listening to the public outcry against the law.
Boycotting travel punish-
es people for simply living in a state, and threatening to cut power for millions cer-tainly will not make Arizona a popular tourist destina-tion. In fact,  it sidesteps the problem all together. 
If Arizona really wanted 
to help, it might try to as-suage fears that visitors will be harassed by police for looking Hispanic once they step off a plane.
This back-and-forth de-
bate amounts to nothing more than a game of tit-for-tat that punishes the wrong people. It needs to stop be-fore everyone is left in the dark.
Thomas Jefferson once said, “All tyran-
ny needs to gain a foothold is for peo-ple of good conscience to remain silent.”  
I had a very insightful lunch the other day with a high-
ranking official of the George W. Bush administration.
He told me the specific policy details of Ronald Rea-
gan’s use of capitalism and freedom to undermine Sovi-
et rule are still classified and not generally known. Rea-
gan’s maneuvers helped those under Soviet dominance 
to recognize the bonds of government and break free. 
It seems unlikely that the media and the current 
administration will ever publicize this part of history.  
Yet the proof is not hidden, just forgotten. Consider 
Pope John Paul II’s speech in Poland to a crowd of 3 
million that helped spark the citizen revolt against 
Communism. Or consider the numerous Russian scholars who admit the communist bloc fell be-
cause the government spent the Kremlin’s last ruble.  
     With the fall of Communism came the beginning of the decline of the old-world political elite, those 
with the state of mind that stemmed from monarchies and autocracies. Through the 20th century, Commu-
nist leaders fronting so-called “people’s movements” 
kept this idea alive as they ruled with an air of enti-tlement to the country’s resources and to the citizens they oppressed. These were the leaders of the Cold War who fought so strongly against capitalism be-
cause they knew it meant a severe blow to their power.  
     Now we see a similarly elitist mind-set exhibited by 
some top Democrats. Obama, Pelosi, Reid, Frank and many others conduct themselves with a defeatist at-titude toward the American individual in the form of 
seeding dependency-increasing entitlement programs. 
They are amassing and centralizing power by taking over some of the largest private sectors of American business (the car industry, health care, etc.). They continue to reward cronies, supporters and unions with various government advan-
tages. They are perpetuating the elitist mind-set using socialist-style programs. Well, this is America, and so-cialism should be completely off the table. 
That conversation is over, and no modern poli-
tician should even permit it to be mentioned.  
If you have read my columns before, you know I am a firm believer in personal freedom and the power of the free market to accomplish objectives over government 
mandate. After discussing the long conquest of Com-
munism by freedom and capitalism, my friend and I 
began to discuss the ramifications of letting our govern-
ment continue to amass and centralize power. 
The American people will have a choice to 
make in 2012—a serious, life-altering choice that 
will decide the future and fate of our country.  
It is at this crossroads that we can choose to quash the 
power trip of our government officials. We can choose to be a country of individual freedom that can provide 
free-market means with limited government support to 
aid our fellow citizens in need. 
Our choice will be simple and clear: We ei-
ther move into a golden age of personal freedom or continue to enable elitist political tendencies.  
America can take heart. The first step down the path of personal freedom is taken with the inalienable power each citizen holds to vote. The best part about it is that the choice is ours, and it is a simple one to make. How-ever, we better not put it off any longer because we have 
spent our last dollar—about 12 trillion times.

Democrats spend 
$800,000 on victory 
Last night, Democrats celebrated their victory in 
a special election for an empty seat in Pennsylva-nia’s 12th Congressional District. We just wonder if 
having another Democrat on Capitol Hill was worth the $800,000 the party spent on advertising.
The winner, Mark Critz, was a long-time fixture under 
Rep. John Murtha who left the seat vacant when he died 
in February. Murtha, although a Democrat, ran on a pro-
life and pro-gun platform; he was even given an “A” from the National Rifle Association for his voting record. Like Murtha, Critz is also pro-life and pro-gun.
The GOP candidate would not have been any different. 
Murtha was hesitant to vote on health care reform without the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which forbade federal mon-ey being used to pay for any health care plan that would cover an abortion.
Critz has never held elected office, so we don’t have 
the luxury of knowing if he will vote the same way as his predecessor. But we are guessing this lackey-turned-Rep-resentative will not have the temerity to stray too far from Murtha’s formula. After all, the guy had a 36-year career 
in Washington.
What is the point in celebrating? The Democrats spent 
more than $800,000 on a campaign and have little to show 
for it. All those color-coded seating charts can stay the 
same, but Critz is blue in name only. The last time we 
checked that doesn’t mean a thing.

 Three-time graduate offers advice for 
the summer student 
 As a three-time UF graduate, I have 10 
summer semesters under my belt. Next to 
fall, it is my favorite time in Gainesville 
because it has many beneﬁ  ts over the reg-
ular season. 
One signiﬁ  cant advantage is much less 
trafﬁ  c on campus and a generally slower 
pace getting around. The alert student can 
take advantage of the fact that everyone is too hot to move very fast. 
You must always wear sunglasses.Another is that most professors don’t 
want to be there, so some of them will cut you slack — but don’t count on it. My worst mistake was taking differential equations during Summer B. Keep the 
workload light, you deserve it.
And because Gainesville is so stinking 
hot, frequent trips to the springs or the 
beach are that much more fun. Just remem-ber to treat the locals with respect because 
— regardless of your state of mind — you 
are a Gator.
Summer lets you burn the candle at 
both ends and have too much fun with less 
at stake. It’s excellent preparation for the 
fall, when you will have many opportuni-ties to get your butt in a sling big time. Just don’t forget the sunglasses.

can culture. Humans have always enjoyed telling epic tales of heroes who are capable of much more than mortal men. These sto-
ries have been around for centuries and 
will persist.
These tales also serve a valuable pur-
pose: They inspire humanity to achieve greatness. Whether the Alligator Edito-
rial Board collectively enjoys them is irrel-
evant. Do you also dislike Greek, Roman or Norse mythology? Are you planning to slam them in your next editorial? You 
kiddies might try researching a topic and 
learning about its intrinsic value to a soci-ety before running off at the keyboard.
But then again, we are talking about the

� UPD REMOVES 750 TO 
1,000 BIKES EACH YEAR.

Students walking around campus 
may wonder about the colored slips 
of paper on abandoned bicycles. 
They’re auction slips from UPD 
that give the owner five days’ notice 
before the bike is broken from its lock and auctioned.Jean-Tui Popenoe, a mechanic for 
Student Government Bike Repair, said the bike collection is an oppor-tunity for UPD to raise money and help keep the campus clean. 
“These are the bikes people don’t 
ride,” he said. “Those who actually 
care about their bike wouldn’t leave 
it in an abandoned state.”
According to UPD spokesman 
Jeff Holcomb, officers put tags on abandoned bicycles about four times a year. The notices give owners five days to either relocate their bikes or remove the tags. If the tag is re-moved, police cannot confiscate the bike by law, Holcomb said, which keeps the bikes on campus.
UPD removes about 750 to 1,000 
bicycles each year, despite efforts to contact students who have reg-istered bicycles, Holcomb said. At the end of the spring semester, UPD 
removed 393 abandoned bicycles 
from the campus.
If five days pass 
and the tags remain, 
UPD takes the bikes to 
the UF surplus unit to be auctioned off in groups of seven. According to Holcomb, students have 30 days to reclaim their bicycles from the Sur-plus Warehouse before an Internet auction. About 8 to 10 percent of the bikes are reclaimed. 
Unclaimed bikes must go to the 
warehouse because under state law it is illegal to donate the bicycles to charity. Although some of the 
bikes that arrive in the warehouse 
are rusted and in need of repair, the bikes sell at a group rate for prices ranging from $40 to $140, according to David Dykes, property manager for Asset Management Services.
“We keep auctioning the bikes 
until a profit is made,” Dykes said.
Profits pay for the removal of the bikes and for the the Internet auc-tion. The remainder  sponsors a UF scholarship fund, Dykes said.
Local bike shop owner Ted 
Kubisek said his shop, Spin Cycle, doesn’t buy any of the bikes from the auction but does repairs for cus-
tomers who purchased their bikes 
from the auction.
 “Most of the bikes are depart-
ment store bikes that are deterio-rated. A nice bike is not deserted,” Kubisek said.
Most of the people who buy de-
serted bikes use them for recreation-al purposes, he said.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 20, 2010

TAMPA — An Army veteran who sped 
away from MacDill Air Force Base security 
on a motorcycle was fatally shot Wednesday by an FBI agent afterthe man threatened him with a knife, officials said.
At about 6 p.m., base security was called to an altercation, which wasn’t described, at a camping area inside the base, said Col. Larry Martin, the base commander.The veteran who 
was described as a guest at the camping area 
was arguing with another person, but officials wouldn’t name either.
“We don’t have a lot of details about what 
went on in that altercation,”Martin said.The veteran sped away on his motorcycle 
and security tried to stop him, Martin said.
He evaded authorities and drove to the 
Dale Mabry Gate, one of the main entrances and exits to the base. Law enforcement tried to stop him and the man got off his motorcycle. He came “directly at” the agent with a knife, said FBI special agent Dave Couvertier. The agent shot more than once, killing the veteran, Couvertier said.
“This individual who was shot, approached 
law enforcement officers,specifically looking at agent and threatening him with a knife,” Coubertiersaid.
No one else was injured. The Air Force did 
not release the agent’s or dead man’s name.Army veteran fatally shot at Air Force base in TampaOnCampu s

advertising
Gatorade ad serves purpose 
By ALEX ORLANDO
avenue writer
“If you want a revolution, the only solu -
tion: evolve, gotta evolve.”
And if you want the words to that song out 
of your head, I suggest you do the same.
Anyone who has seen, or even heard the 
new Gatorade commercial, featuring Kevin 
Quinn’s song “Evolve,” knows what I’m talk -
ing about. It’s just so damn catchy.
Ever since it jingled its way through my 
eardrums, it’s all I think about. I’ll catch my -
self singing it in the car, in the shower, in 
class and even on the can.
But, in all seriousness, when was the last 
time anyone heard a jingle on TV?
Companies seem so concerned nowa-
days with completely irrelevant gimmicks 
and characters that they draw attention away from the product. Certain insurance-pushing geckos, offended cavemen and unemployed ducks come to mind right about now.
So, to alleviate my curiosity, I called into 
Gatorade to see what gave the company the nerve to commission such subliminal weaponry. Unfortunately, the representative couldn’t give me any information. Apparently, 
she was too busy trying to get the song out of 
her head, too.
But really, not since Oscar Meyer have we 
heard such charisma for a food product. It 
gets you thinking, maybe he does have a way 
with b-o-l-o-g-n-a. And maybe to have a revo -
lution, we do need a solution of sugar, wa-ter and electrolytes. And you, too, can evolve past grape drink.
But maybe it does help. Maybe we’re 
straying away from the irrelevant, dry humor presented to us between 15-minute stretch-es of SportsCenter. Maybe we’re getting back 
to the days of advertising when the ad ac-
tually has something to do with the product it’s selling. Watch out, advertising majors. Your quirky, pseudo-creative ads are a dying breed.
I just wonder what they’ll think of next. 
How about a jingle for steroids?
“If you never wanna lose, the only thing 
you gotta use is juice, gotta get some juice.”.XXX will add porn sites
By KATHERINE BEIN 
avenue writer 
The Internet is for porn, and if a contro-
versial proposal gets backing, there could 
be a whole lot more of it coming soon. 
The International Corporation for As-
signed Names and Numbers is mulling over 
the idea of creating a new domain for the scandalous sites, “.xxx,” to set them apart 
from less obscene content. 
Like all things kinky, it’s been done be -
fore. ICANN announced in 2005 that the 
domain would be created but reversed the 
decision a year later and rejected it a third 
time in 2007. 
ICANN is scheduled to take this most re -
cent stance in June. 
The idea is that parents, schools and 
employers could easily block adult content. The issue is that free-speech advocates fear such distinction could lead to censorship, as well as questions as to who decides what 
qualifies as obscene. 
Professor David Carlson, executive direc-
tor for the Center for Media Innovation and 
Research, said there is no way to tell wheth-er the proposal will finally be implemented 
but guessed that it would be even more dif-
ficult to enforce. 
“The Internet is unlike anything else ever 
known to man in that no one owns it, no 
one controls it,” Carlson said. “I don’t know 
whether (the proposal) would have the in-tended effect.” 
Even more, Carlson admitted there isn’t 
much, if anything, that can be done to con-
vert preexisting sites. 
There would be nothing to keep porn 
“.com”ers from keeping the old 
sites running while simultane -
ously opening new venues with the “.xxx” domain. That double 
domain penetration coupled with new sites could result in a lot of sticky tissues, I mean issues.
Brian Greenfeild, a fourth-year biology ma-
jor at UF, said he doesn’t think his porn con-sumption would be affected by the change but sees the use in it preventing youngsters 
from stumbling onto pornographic sites. 
When asked about the electronic land-
grab sure to follow, Greenfeild said he was 
all for it. On theWeb10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 20, 2010
Drink to American craft beerbehind the bar
By RICHARD STEHLI 
avenue writer  
 Frost your glasses and grab your 
bottle opener because this is Amer-
ican Craft Beer Week.  Let’s take a few minutes and give thanks for the goodness of craft beer in the USA.
 You might think this country is 
soaked in cheap, ﬂ  avorless beer, but be thankful you weren’t around in the ‘70s. In the spirit of a shiny, new national culture, low price and homogeneity took precedence over beer quality in a big way. There were less operating brewers and breweries in America than at any 
other time in history, and the vast 
majority of beer was bland, to say the very least. At one point, super-markets carried generic “Beer,” a drink so terrible no company even put its name on the can.
Eventually, forces converged 
to propel us out of the craft beer stone age and into the sort of ﬁ  ne 
“beerscape” we see today. 
Students started traveling and studying abroad. After drinking in Belgium or Germany, coming home 
to a relative wasteland of bever-ages was not acceptable.
Also, the late beer guru Michael 
Jackson (not that one), better known as “The Beer Hunter,” pub-lished his ﬁ  rst book in 1977, “The World Guide to Beer.” The book be-came a best seller and inﬂ  uenced 
millions at home and abroad to put 
down that bland light beer and pick up something a little better.
Perhaps most importantly, then 
28-year-old Fritz Maytag bought the ailing Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco. After years of re-vamping the recipe and brewery and doing everything from bot-
tling to making deliveries, Maytag 
turned the company around and proﬁ  ted. Once people saw that it was possible to make great tasting beer and make money doing it, the ﬂ  oodgates opened, and craft brew-ing was reborn.
Since then, craft brewing has 
taken the country and the world by storm. Hops have been elevated 
from an additive to the star of the 
show. Famous Old-World styles have been reproduced and im-proved with American brewers at the helm. It was like a new Ameri-can manifest destiny, exploring and conquering the unknown to its lim-its with a mix of skill and spirit.
So raise a glass to all those that 
came before us, whether brewery owners, brewers, critics or simply the man on the street demanding something that tastes better. Our forerunners have done well for us, and the limitless choices of great beer available all over this country is one thing our parents’ genera-tion won’t have to apologize for.
Come celebrate American Craft 
Beer Week at Stubbies & Steins tonight from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. for $1 off all American craft beers and a chance to meet the guys from Gainesville’s own Swamp Head Brewery. If you can’t make it to the event, don’t sweat it – just grab the best tasting beer you can ﬁ  nd.

 She was working at a computer 
next to me the ﬁ  rst time I saw her, 
and the glowing monitor made her 
face shine a little bit. She stood up, ignored me and I took the time to get a good look at her. She wasn’t tall, but her hair was long and wispy. She had a smile and laugh that car-ried through the room. I shook her hand when I introduced myself hop-ing she wouldn’t notice I couldn’t 
catch my breath. That was a crush.
We would stroll and talk through 
scenic paths, drinking coffee and 
harboring a growing sense of, “I want your body-ism.” We took a trip in the sun for work and at some point had developed an easy rap-port that was fun to fall back on. It was a careful rhythm barred only by 
the fact I was in a tumultuously frag-
ile relationship. She got drunk and confessed herself to me in casual tears. I held her close for the ﬁ  rst 
time, and for the ﬁ  rst time I felt a 
possibility of sex. My blood boiled. That was lust.
The two of us raged, fought and 
slept for days. She had to leave town. I had to make a decision. 
I decided to try and make it work. 
We were making a late-night din-ner in the dim glow of her mother’s granite kitchen, and I realized that no one had ever made me laugh so much. Living without this woman 
would not be living at all. Her shape 
and presence were so strong and her eyes so soft. I had to stop and take stock of what I had found. I was following her up the stairs admiring her, and I realized for the ﬁ  rst time in my life I had something to lose. That was when I fell in love with her.
We meet people. We like them, 
and sometimes we think we love them. But it can be difﬁ  cult to dif-ferentiate the difference. It can only help if you try. Crush, lust or love?THURSDAY, MAY 20, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 11

Bars can be an intimidating hangout for the antisocial
When you find yourself living 
in Gainesville during the summer months, acquiring 
new friends to band together with is key to survival. There are plenty of places to do this: farmers markets, school clubs, the Taco Bell in the Re -
itz Union and so on.       Since I recently reached the legal age in which life becomes worth liv -
ing, 21, I decided to search the bars of this fair town for new friends to exploit—uh, I mean, hang out with.
Now readers, full disclosure: I 
am no stranger to bars. Besides 
being an exceedingly popular writer 
for this publication, I also moonlight as a mediocre (at best) stand-up 
comedian, plying my trade in bars since my freshman year. It was in-
credibly nerve-racking being under -
age and sober in a bar. Most of my 
time was spent sitting in the corner looking at my phone like I had just 
received a gravely important text 
message (really, it was a gravely important game of Brick Breaker). 
I’ve had three years to get over 
the social anxiety that comes with 
being in a bar with a bunch of 
drunks, and 21 years to get over the anxiety that comes with living in a house with a bunch of drunks 
(Hi, Mom! Happy Birthday, Dad!), so it’s no 
surprise that when I confi-
dently stride 
into a bar n o w a d a y s , I quickly 
crumble and 
cower in the corner, going 
back to work on my high score.
However, as my stand-up act be -
comes more polished (read: more fart jokes), I’ve found something amazing happens. When I do well, people come talk to me. One girl 
actually asked me if I was single, then if I would take her number 
(have you ever been taking a test that seemed too easy, and all of 
a sudden start thinking that you 
might be actually wrong about ev -
erything?). 
Someone else bought me a 
drink. I began to realize that peo -
ple might be attracted to success. However, even though others felt the need to break the ice for my highly successful self, I still man-
age to keep things very frosty. One 
such exchange: 
Girl: “Hi, you were very funny!” Me: “Yes, I was. I also write a 
column for the Avenue.”Girl: “Really? Wow. Maybe you’d 
like to write a column about me.” 
Me: “I guess.”
Basically, I’m nearly hopeless. 
For some reason bars, the easiest 
places in the world  to meet people, make me more antisocial than that 
kid who never left his dorm room 
(me). 
But there is a glimmer of hope: 
I still have that girl’s number, read-ers, and we’ve been texting each 
other constantly. I’ll soon work 
up the courage to actually send her words, instead of every single emoticon I can think of. Maybe a 
fart joke—those seem to work.

‘Vincere’ tells tale of fascism, Mussolini’s lost romance
� FILM OPENS FRIDAY AT THE HIPP.
 
By BRITT PERKINS
avenue writer
If there is one gleaming message in the 
desolate heart-puller that is “Vincere,” it’s this: 
marry a fascist and expect to get screwed. 
Vincere is Italian for “win,” and that’s pret-
ty much the opposite of what happens to the 
supposed first wife of Benito Mussolini, Ida 
Dalser (Giovanno Mezzogiorno). 
She sells all her possessions to help fund 
Mussolini’s first newspaper, and in the pro -
cess inadvertently helps the rise of fascism.
As any torrid love affair should become, 
things get hot really quick. However, as any -
one dating a future dictator should expect, there are obligatory “red flags,” so to speak. 
In a particularly intense scene, Mussolini 
(Filippo Timi)  is fleeing police with a massive, 
bleeding head wound. Any normal woman 
would probably not find this particularly sexy, but Dalser takes advantage of the opportunity to sneak in a quick makeout sesh. 
Aroused by his political passions and ac-
tivism in the Socialist party, Dalser supported Mussolini financially and even gave birth to their son in 1915. 
Mussolini eventually found his true calling 
during World War I, and like any good man 
who elevates his position in life, leaves Dalser 
in the dust. 
Dalser, being the type of woman who gets 
turned on by head wounds, never gets over it. Mussolini was a stone cold killer and 
wasn’t having any of that, so he put her in a psychiatric hospital where she eventually 
died. Oh, and little Benito died in an insane 
asylum as well at age 26. 
Spliced into the melodrama of the film are 
historical clips of Mussolini in all his tyrant-like glory. A stark reminder of the harsh-ness and dark reality of the man and his era.
Juxtaposed against the 
raids and bombings are the 
intense emotions and pas-
sions the two actors at first convey, then lose. 
It is a tragic tale of love found and lost, but a convincing one.
Though heart-wrenching at times, the film deals with broad and intense subject matter in a way that punches you in the gut and still leaves you wanting more. 
“Vincere” has been making the rounds 
and winning awards, as well. It took Best Ac-tor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Cine -
matography at the Chicago International Film Festival. 
So if you’re looking for something light and 
fluffy, this particular film may not be your cup of tea. But if you want to be challenged by an unconventional love story that makes you think, by all means have a drink.
“Vincere” opens at the Hippodrome 
State Theatre downtown Friday with two showings at 6:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. The film runs until May 27. For more movie times visit thehipp.org/cinema/.  THURSDAY, MAY 20, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 13 12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 20, 2010
Gainesville Comedy Showcase takes on area’s bar scene
By DREW WILSON
opinions editor
“I drive a Honda Fit, which is 
ironic,” Chris Cope said.
A rotund 7-year stand-up vet-
eran, Cope was one of the eight 
comedians who performed at XS 
on Monday night. The dance floor, 
which is usually empty on Mondays, is converted to a comedy club each week so Cope and a revolving lineup of fellow Gainesville Comedy Show -
case comedians can perform. 
Besides putting out tables and 
chairs, the bar staff worked the crowd, taking drink orders so peo -
ple could pay attention to the show rather than walk to the bar for a refill. One of the bartenders, Eric Buskirk, said he has been coming to the showcase shows for nearly 
four years. He even volunteers to 
come in on his day off to work the XS performance. He makes it a point to laugh or cheer to rile up the 
crowd whenever he finds something 
funny.
“Laughter is infectious,” Buskirk 
said. “I’m just trying to do my part.”
The show was scheduled to start 
at 10:30 p.m. but it took a few min-utes for the 40-person crowd to set-tle down with drinks in hand. 
The comedians performed about 
10 minutes of material each. But Calvin Cole, a featured comedian, 
took the stage for around 20 min-
utes and Cope, as the headliner, rounded out the show with a half-
hour set.
“Life is all about enjoying your -
self while touching other people,” 
Cole said.
Cole, a 22-year-old UF graduate, 
has been doing stand-up comedy for about three years and is repre -
senting UF on the University Stand-up Comedy Club national team (“U 
SUCC,” as its members call it)  for 
his second year running. The four-person squad competes against teams from other schools in what 
Cole describes as an “NCAA tourna-
ment head-to-head fashion.” 
Crowd voting decides who ad -
vances in the competition, he said, and last year the UF team made it to 
the final stop in Aspen, Colo., before 
it went out in third place. Cole is op-timistic about the team’s chances to go all the way this year, though.
“We’re up against Duke right 
now,” he said. “And we’re definitely going to beat them.”
The laughs were sparse at times, 
but they were never hard to come 
by for Cole and the other come -
dians, some of who perform up to 
four nights a week in the Gainesville area.  
It’s only the second week 
Gainesville Comedy Showcase has performed at XS, but the show’s MC, Dave Johnson, sees the Mon-day night show as the happy me -
dium among the troupe’s other shows, which he said range from come-as-you-are to an almost pro -
fessional level.
Johnson describes Gainesville 
Comedy Showcase’s Friday night show at the Clarion Lounge as the 
show to see for people looking for 
a professional comedy show in the area. Typically fewer comedians are put on the roster, and they are usu -
ally granted more stage time. 
It is a far departure from the 
Thursday night shows at the Clari-on Lounge and the Tuesday night shows at 1982, which have an ama-
teur theme. In order to get on the 
lineup for one of those shows, as-piring comics just need to make the other comedians laugh.
“It really all hinges on what they 
show us at the Sunday workshops,” Johnson said, “The ‘82 show is pret-ty much the closest thing to an open mic in Gainesville.”
Tuesday and Thursday are not 
without their benefits. According to Cole, those shows are when he and some of the other comedians try out their new material.
“There are a lot of regulars at 
1982,” he said. “They’re there ev -
ery week, and I like to reward them with new material whenever I can.”
Johnson said GCS plans to put on 
a show at XS every Monday at 10:30 p.m. in addition to the group’s other weekly shows at 1982 on Tuesdays at 9:45 p.m. and at the Clarion 
Lounge on Thursdays and Fridays at 
9:15 pm.

humor  
By ERIN RAUCH
avenue writer
There were no maracas in Paxico via Mex-
ico’s set on Saturday. None of the band mem-
bers were wearing sombreros.
But a young woman in the crowd eager to 
find a Hispanic beat shook her empty, plastic 
beer cup with so much purpose and enthusi-asm I wondered if she thought she was actually 
holding the gourd-shaped rattle.
Looking around I noticed the Atlantic’s 
crowd was drifting into a trance.
Two girls to my left were moving slowly and 
touching their hips slightly, making sure not to spill a drop of their cranberry-vodka drinks. 
A boy wearing a backward plaid baseball cap 
swayed and sang along with his eyes closed.
All the while, Paxico via Mexico, a local 
Gainesville band, sang lyrics swathed in quiet 
emotion with undertones of folk and rock.Ricky Kendall, the lead singer, said it took 
around two weeks to finish the band’s second EP, “Under the Mountain,” which the band de -
buted at the show. He said the band sold about 60 EPs that night.
Jared Groom, the band’s animated drum-
mer, sang along to every song even though he 
had no microphone. 
“I’m a pocket drummer,” he said. “I like to 
groove a lot.”
Two years ago, the band played its first 
show as Ricky Kendall and the Spooky Divide. The original idea was to change the name of 
the band for every show. Instead, fans voted on 
120 names the band posted on its Facebook page.
While in a Mexican restaurant, the band 
downsized the list fans had voted on. It came down to “The Paxico Kids,” but the band was not satisfied.
John Dunne, lead vocalist and guitarist, is 
from Kansas, where Paxico is a city. Thus, Paxi-co via Mexico was born.
Three hours before they went on stage the 
band members and friends went to their favor -
ite bar in downtown Gainesville, Alcove. Bass 
player Tony Cordova drank a Lagunitas Hairy 
Eyeball, a seasonal malt ale, and we talked about upcoming events for Paxico via Mexico.
Kendall said the band hope to release its 
first full-length album in August. Band members have been able to produce the album thanks to donations from fans and friends. Kendall said in less than three months they raised $943.
Although three of the six members will no 
longer play in the band, fans will still hear them on the album.
Groom said he will miss the members who 
are leaving. “I think what makes it even more of a strug-
gle is that we’re all like a family,” he said.
Kendall, Groom and Cordova said they 
aren’t looking to replace John Dunne, Daniel Cummings,  the keyboardist, or Stacie Cum-mings, who plays the cello, tambourine and 
sings. The three band members are moving on 
after they graduate.
Daniel and Stacie Cummings were not at 
the show. Jason Sanders, a friend of the band, 
filled in on keyboard and tambourine.
As members of the crowd closed their eyes, 
tapped their feet and moved their hips, the 
sensation from the intimate lyrics pouring from 
the stage grabbed hold.
“There is something really cool going on in 
Gainesville, and we are a part of that,” Kendall said. “It’s nice to feel welcomed into the music scene.”
Paxico via Mexico was more than just wel-
comed at the show. After the crowd repeatedly 
chanted “one more song,” Dunne picked up 
an acoustic guitar and began to play Hallowed Ground, a song from the newly released EP.
Fans can buy the EP at Paxico via Mex-
ico’s next show or online at its website, paxi-
coviamexico.com. 
Kendall said songs should be available on 
iTunes and Pandora in a couple months.
Near the end of the show, Dunne thanked 
the crowd and Gainesville for a good ride. Al-
though half of the band will be gone by sum-mer, I have no doubt that Paxico via Mexico will continue to captivate a crowd with its unique groove and Folk Americana melodies.
“People feel what we do,” Kendall said. “We 
have a lot of really good friends and support-ers.”Paxico via Mexico debuts EP, discusses band’s future

UF GYMNASTICS UF BASKETBALL TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETTHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF center fielder Matt den Dekker leads the team with a .365 batting average and 20 stolen bases. The 
senior is coming off a junior season in which he hit just .296 to go along with five home runs.
� NO. 4 UF TAKES ON NO. 6 
SOUTH CAROLINA TONIGHT AT 7.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator.org
Before the season, Matt den 
Dekker did not discuss personal ac-
complishments. 
He ignored talking about his 
speed and penchant for the long 
ball. Instead, the senior talked about 
leaving UF atop the Southeastern Conference. 
Den Dekker and the rest of the 
Gators (38-12, 20-7 SEC) will have their chance tonight at 7 when No. 4 Florida travels to No. 6 South 
Carolina (42-11, 20-7 SEC) for the 
first game in what has become the de facto conference regular-season championship series.
“It would mean everything for 
our careers, and we haven’t gotten it done,” den Dekker said of finishing in first place. “We set out at the be-ginning of the year with some of our team goals, and up first was to win an SEC Championship.”
But even without personal expec-
tations, den Dekker has been UF’s offensive leader. The senior paces 
the team with a .365 average and 20 
stolen bases. He is also second with 11 home runs, including three long balls in the last five games.
His production at the plate is 
much improved from last year, when his batting average was about 70 points lower and he hit just five homers. Den Dekker said those 
struggles coincided with MLB Draft 
expectations.
“I’m a little more relaxed this 
year,” he said. “Last year I was pressing a little bit, I guess trying to do too much, trying to make some things happen. But I’ve learned a lot in the last couple years and I’m glad I came back.”
College baseball players are not 
eligible for the draft until their ju-nior years. Players can also turn pro instead of going to college, but den Dekker went undrafted out of Fort Lauderdale Westminster High so last season was the first time he received serious looks from MLB teams.
“Any guy that gets draft eligible 
has it in the back of their mind that they got to produce,” den Dekker said. “It’s a lesson I learned and Den Dekker bounces back to lead Gators as senior
Integrity is one of the key reasons we all love sports.
It gives us something to believe in 
and it takes us away from the corruption we are exposed to in everyday life.
But sometimes integrity is lost.There are constant murmurs about 
teams tanking their seasons to get a top pick in their respective league’s draft, ef-fectively killing sports’ purity.
That’s where the NBA Draft Lottery 
comes in. A unique system in which teams that miss the playoffs are bunched together into an unpredictable process to 
determine the draft order. 
This means the worst team, while 
owning the best chance at the first pick, 
is not guaranteed the top selection like in the NFL and MLB drafts. 
As a matter of fact, the NBA’s worst 
team has only received the first pick four times in the 26 years that the system has been in place.
The New Jersey Nets had the best shot 
at winning the John Wall sweepstakes this season after finishing with the 
fourth-worst re-
cord in NBA his-tory at 12-70, but still only managed to come away with the third overall selection in this year’s draft.
H o w e v e r , 
some people will 
argue that there are some negatives to this system.
1. Corruption: In its attempt to fight 
against it, the NBA really leaves itself vulnerable to corruption.
The actual drawing of the ping-pong 
balls is done behind closed doors, which means critics argue the NBA rigs it so big-
market teams have a better chance to get 
top picks.

 After three months and 51 games the 
UF softball season is just beginning. 
When a team starts the season as the 
No. 3 squad in the nation and the two-time 
defending Southeastern Conference cham-pion, an opportunity to play in the NCAA Tournament is almost assured. 
What matters most is what it does with 
that opportunity. 
The No. 4 Gators (43-8) will begin their 
quest for a national championship Friday when they take on Bethune-Cookman (32-22) at 6 p.m. in Katie Seashole Pressley Stadium in the first game of an NCAA Re-gional that also includes UCF (35-21) and FIU (36-19).
This will mark the sixth consecutive 
year the Gators have hosted an NCAA Re-gional and the second time they have wel-comed Bethune-Cookman and UCF, which both played in the Gainesville Regional in 2005. 
“Hosting is a huge advantage,” senior 
Francesca Enea said. “We’re going to have a ton of fan support, and even though the other schools from Florida will have fans too, the fact that it’s the postseason brings out support for us from the Gainesville community.”
Gainesville’s all-Florida regional fea-
tures a pair of familiar foes, as the Gators already clashed with both UCF and FIU earlier in the season. 
UF’s March 31 showdown against UCF 
in Orlando turned out to be one of the most dramatic games of the season, as the UF set to begin Regionals

Freshman Brittany Schutte and the Gators will look to get past three schools from 
Florida to win their Regional held in Gainesville.
Gators coming off 9-1 loss to LSU
Knights took a 3-1 lead into the seventh be-
fore Enea and freshman Brittany Schutte tied the game with RBI hits to send it in to extra-innings. 
Schutte later blasted a home run to center to 
give the Gators the 4-3 win in the team’s only 
nine-inning game.
If UCF’s senior ace Ashleigh Cole can 
match her complete-game performance from 
the teams’ first meeting, the Gators could be in 
for another close contest. 
But as tough of a matchup as that was, the 
FIU contest went considerably worse for Flor-
ida. 
In the first game of what was scheduled 
to be a doubleheader, the Golden Panthers 
pounded out 11 hits in an 8-3 victory April 20 
in Gainesville. 
“I think it’s going to be a tough regional,” 
Enea said. “Two of them we played this year 
and with UCF we played tight and FIU ran over us.”
It also appears that UF is catching each of 
these teams during relative hot streaks, as FIU has won 11 of its last 15, UCF has won eight of its last nine, and Bethune-Cookman has won 10 of its last 11. 
Regardless of how these teams have played 
recently, the Gators know they will get the best 
their opposition has to offer any time they take 
on an in-state opponent. 
“Florida teams always want to beat us just 
because we’re UF so we always have to have 
our guard up,” Enea said. 
While their opposition enters the NCAA 
Tournament on a high note, 
the Gators enter the Region-al coming off their worst loss 
of the season, a 9-1 trouncing 
at the hands of No. 11 LSU 
in the semifinals of the SEC 
Tournament. 
But to this point in the 
season Florida has shown it 
is capable of bouncing back after a tough de-feat, as the team is 7-0 in games following a loss this season. 
“I expect a huge bounceback,” Enea said. 
“We don’t like to lose, it’s hard to even think about. So we’re coming in with a chip on our shoulder and looking to prove to the country how good this Florida team is.”                           SOFTBALL , from page 20
Celtics, the four biggest NBA markets in my opin-
ion, have only won the lottery a combined three times. 
So that rules this conspiracy theory out.2. Unbalanced: When teams such as the Phila-
delphia 76ers, the 20th worst team in the NBA in 1986, win the lottery, that isn’t always good for the league.
The pros that come along with the NFL and 
MLB systems is that it’s stable and consistent. The worst team will pick first, while the best team will pick last. 
Which is why some people say good teams in 
the NBA dominate for longer. The lottery doesn’t always reward the worst teams, killing their chances of competing with the big boys.
But that just isn’t true. In the last 40 years, 14 teams in both the NFL 
and NBA have won titles, which shows the differ-ent systems used to decide the draft order in each 
league don’t necessarily affect parity as much as 
people think.
With those criticisms put to rest, I can’t find 
many more reasons to poke holes.
I will always support a system that keeps teams 
competitive and creates some excitement for fans of non-playoff teams during the postseason.
Now, let’s take a page out of sports’ book and 
have some integrity and give the NBA some well-
deserved credit.ANTHONY , from page 20Adams’ struggles contin ue
hopefully other guys can learn the 
lesson, too.”
Junior Josh Adams is going 
through similar struggles this year. After batting .336 his first two sea-
sons, he is hitting just .221 this year. 
The second baseman’s slugging 
percentage has also dropped from 
.514 to .381 and his place in the Gators lineup has fallen from sec-ond to ninth.
Adams’ problems continued last 
weekend against Georiga, when he went just 1 for 9. But even through 
the struggles, Adams can look be-
hind him in the outfield to see an example of how to bounce back.
After trying to force production 
last season, den Dekker has calmed down, not worrying about how scouts will see him. And the results have been impressive, leading coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan to argue den Dekker is the nation’s pre-mier center fielder.
 “We really ap-
preciate everything he brings to the 
table,” O’Sullivan said. “He means an awful lot to us both on and off the 
field. We’re probably going to un-
fairly compare future center fielders to Matt.”BASEBALL , from page 20Enea

With one out in the bottom of 
the seventh, her team trailing by 
one and a national championship on the line, then-junior Francesca Enea stepped up to the plate and did what she’s done countless times in her UF career -- she deliv-ered. 
Enea crushed a double down 
the left-field line, but could then only watch as the final two outs were recorded and the Washing-ton Huskies celebrated their 2009 NCAA championship, dashing Florida’s hopes of winning it all for the first time in school history. 
A title has been about the only 
thing that has eluded Enea in her time as a Gator.
The senior left fielder has set 
eight Florida and Southeastern Conference hitting records, spent an entire season playing through injury, led the team both vocally and by example all year, directed numerous community service proj-ects and even accepted a marriage proposal on the field. 
Despite all that, there’s still one 
thing Enea hasn’t done: win a na-tional championship. 
“Not many teams can say they 
walked away with a national championship under their belt,” Enea said. “So many girls around here or at other schools have bro-ken records and that’s great, but being able to say that you won a national championship with your team would be irreplaceable.” Tough as nails
When Enea first set foot on 
Florida’s campus four years ago, she had no idea her career could blossom into what it has become today. 
The then-catcher described her-
self as just an average offensive player -- certainly not someone who would go on to set the SEC ca-reer home run record with 61. 
“I never thought I would be 
much of a home-run hitter,” Enea said. “I thought maybe I got lucky whenever I hit one out, so my suc-cess the last couple years has kinda surprised me.”
Just looking at Enea’s freshman 
numbers, it would be pretty easy to assume her assessment was ac-curate. 
During the 2007 season, in 
which she played just 48 games due to a knee injury, Enea hit a meager .227 with only six home runs and 22 RBIs. 
While those numbers may have 
been a detriment to her career sta-tistics, the lessons she learned from that down year have proven to be invaluable.
“It just taught me that I can get 
out pretty easily and that some-times you won’t be as successful as you want to be, but you can’t let that factor into how well the team is going to do,” Enea said. “It taught me to take each at-bat and learn from it, to not get down when I get out but instead learn from ev-ery at-bat and every play and that’s what helped me the most.”
Even once she put her freshman 
season behind her and learned how to deal with her mistakes, Enea continued to face adversity.
In the fall of 2008, she suffered 
a tear on the same ACL that side-lined her during a stretch of her freshman campaign. 
An injury of that nature would 
typically lead to season-ending surgery, but instead Enea chose to tough it out, playing the entire 2009 season in pain. 
She finished the year with 18 
homers and a  single-season record 70 RBIs while posting a .339 batting average.
While Enea was battling through 
injury and willing herself to one of the greatest seasons in UF softball history on just one knee, she still felt sorry for the team more than herself. 
“I think it really affected the 
team more than it affected me,” Enea said. “I felt bad when I couldn’t get to balls in the outfield and I couldn’t make turns running the bases. I just felt I couldn’t be as great for the team as I wanted to be.”
On the surface it appears that 
the injury has healed and things are back to normal, but there are still numerous occasions where it is obvious Enea will never be back to 100 percent.
During a game on May 8 against 
South Carolina, Enea spent nearly a minute on the ground after tak-ing what appeared to be a routine swing, clearly experiencing consid-erable pain. 
“Unfortunately I’ve had knee 
problems all through my life,” Enea said. “As I’m getting older it’s getting harder to deal with but I’m just trying to push myself through. I’m just going through every day taking care of business, seeing whatever doctors I have to so that I can finish the season and do well in my future career.”
Not surprisingly, Enea finished 
the at-bat and is yet to miss a start this season. 
Been there, done that
When a player deals with as 
much adversity as Enea has over the years, it seems that leadership comes naturally both on and off the field. 
In terms of Florida softball, Enea 
offers a level of experience that only fellow senior Corrie Brooks can match, as they are the only two players who have been through both the ups of a trip to the Wom-en’s College World Series final and the downs of a 22-loss season in their freshman seasons. 
While all of the team’s sopho-
mores and juniors already under-stand the importance of not putting too much pressure on themselves and just trying to have fun in big games like those in the SEC and NCAA Tournaments, only Enea and Brooks can speak to the impor-tance of bouncing back from losses and keeping everything going in the right direction. “In the beginning of the season 
Corrie and I talked to them and we 
said, ‘Listen, we aren’t going to win 
every game this year,’” Enea said. “We told them that we’re going to lose a little bit more, and how suc-
cessful we can be is based on how 
we bounce back from those losses. 
“Now we aren’t afraid to lose, 
we just know what its like and 
we’re not gonna let that happen.”
It is this hard-working, never-
quit attitude that has made Enea not just the player she is today but also the person she is today --  someone who has spent countless hours giving back to the Gainesville community.
Over her four years she has 
organized the Swing for Can-cer event, was the co-chair of the Climb for Cancer Sport Camps and was the catalyst behind the team’s “adoption” of a 13-year-old girl with a brain tumor via the Friends of Jacyln Foundation. 
She has also been heavily in-
volved with CAMP Gator, Ga-torTracks, Habitat for Humanity, the Special Olympics, Miracles on Main, and even squeezes in weekly visits to Shands Hospital. 
“I do all that just for the simple 
fact that I can do it,” Enea said. “The University of Florida pro-vides you with so many outlets to get involved so why not take ad-vantage of it?”
A dream come true
Although Enea will leave Flori-
da with the career records for home 
runs (61), RBIs (220) and slugging 
percentage (.646), the most memo-rable moment of her career might have nothing to do with softball. 
In what can only be described 
as one of the most remarkable Se-nior Days in the history of UF ath-letics, Enea experienced not only the traditional festivities but also 
a surprise marriage proposal that 
left herself and everyone else in the 
stadium in shock. 
While Enea, her family and 
coach Tim Walton posed for a pic-
ture alongside Enea’s framed jersey 
and bouquet of flowers, Christian Bruey, a UF alumnus and Enea’s 
boyfriend of three years, sneaked up behind the group and dropped to a knee. 
Enea, who quickly said yes, was 
taken aback by the presence of Bru-ey, who gave Enea the impression he wouldn’t be able to attend the Senior Day celebration. 
“He said he wasn’t going to be 
able to make it and I was giving him crap about it for weeks and saying he was going to be in the dog house if he didn’t come on time,” Enea said. “Then all of a sudden I heard someone shout his name out from the crowd and I looked and saw him and he didn’t waste any time, he went right down on one knee and I was just shocked.”
Thanks to some clever planning 
by Bruey, who first met Enea while doing the radio broadcasts for Gators softball during her fresh-man year, only a small group of people knew that such a plan was in the works, least of all Enea. 
And although the senior was 
blindsided by Bruey’s unexpected proposal, it turns out the plan was actually Enea’s idea all along. 
“I had a dream about it two 
years ago,” Enea said. “So I said to him, ‘Oh I had a dream that you proposed to me on Senior Day,’ and he said ‘Well that’ll never hap-pen because I’ll never make enough money for the ring you want.’ So I said ‘Yeah you’re probably right,’” 
Enea was able to follow the 
pregame theatrics with her SEC-record-breaking 61st career home run, but she is now only concerned with putting the day behind her and focusing on what is still left to be accomplished. 
“It was a great day and I don’t 
think I could stop smiling, but now the day’s over and I’m just trying to move on and not get distracted by it,” Enea said. 
Because with just three weeks 
to go in her Florida softball career, Enea and her teammates are hon-ing in on the only thing that has managed to elude them the last three years -- a national champion-ship. Looking for a different ring

UF sophomore Joanna Mather was moved to the No. 2 doubles team 
with Lauren Embree April 9 at Tennessee and the duo is 7-0 since. 
UF GOLF� BOTH TEAMS WILL BEGIN 
PLAY IN THE ROUND OF 16.

The Gators tennis teams 
schedule top-ranked non-con-
ference opponents in the regular season to prepare for the NCAA Tournament. But in the round of 
16 in Athens, Ga., both teams will 
face a Southeastern Conference opponent.
The No. 3 women’s team (26-2) 
takes on No. 17 Mississippi (17-5) 
today at 9 a.m.
When the teams played in 
Gainesville on March 28, UF won 
easily 6-1. While the Rebels may 
be looking forward to playing the 
Gators on a neutral court, they should know it’s a court where Florida has performed well.  By defeating Georgia on the road 
and winning the SEC Tourna-
ment, the Gators are 4-0 this season at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex.
UF coach Roland Thornqvist 
downplayed the Athens familiar-ity factor in today’s match.
“Having experience in Georgia is not going to give us a 1-0 start in the match,” Thornqvist said.
What gives Florida an in-
creased chance of going up 1-0 is the change made in doubles since the last time UF played Mississippi.  Sophomore Joanna 
Mather, who battled a foot in-
jury earlier this season, recently switched places with senior An-astasia Revzina to play the No. 2 
position with freshman Lauren 
Embree.
Thornqvist said he made the 
switch because Mather’s speed 
and athleticism 
compliment Em-bree’s similar style of play.  Af-
ter eight matches 
with the new lineup, Thornqvist 
feels positions Nos. 2 and 3 ben-efit from the switch.
“Lauren is probably the fastest 
person I’ve played with,” Mather said.
If the speedy duo and the rest 
of the Gators make it past the 
Rebels, they could face another 
familiar foe.  Seven other op-ponents Florida faced this dual-match season are in the round of 16.The No. 6 men’s team (21-4) 
will face a familiar opponent on 
Friday at 6 p.m.: championship 
host and SEC East rival No. 12 Georgia (19-7).
Florida defeated Georgia in 
two previous meetings this sea-
son, most recently a 5-2 win in 
Gainesville on April 11.
The Gators’ other victory 
against the Bulldogs came on a 
neutral court, meaning UF has 
not traveled to Athens, Ga. this season.
Despite the revenge factor and 
home court favoring Georgia, UF 
coach Andy Jackson sees Florida 
as one of the teams with a legiti-mate chance to win it all.
“I don’t know how many 
teams have a chance but we’re one of the teams that have a chance,” Jackson said. “Regard-less, we’re going to be ready to go Friday night.”
If the Gators advance to the 
Final Four, they might a get third shot at No. 2 Tennessee (27-1).  Tennessee defeated Florida 4-3 
on April 9 in Gainesville to win 
the SEC regular-season title and again in Lexington, Ky. on April 25 to win the SEC Tournament Championship.Gators to face SEC foes again

The Gators hope to repeat last season’s 
accomplishment when they travel to Indiana 
Thursday.
Florida won the Southeast Regional in 
2009 and hope to repeat this year by winning the Central Regional.
To do it again, No. 6 UF will have to con-
quer The Warren Golf Course in Notre Dame, Ind.,  Thursday.
“Last year we played pretty well (in re-
gionals), and I think it’s going to happen again,” UF coach Buddy Alexander said.
In the four years Florida has won a na-
tional title, they have never won a regional in that same year. But the team isn’t focused on the past.
“I don’t think it matters if we win here, 
it doesn’t mean we are not going to win, we haven’t won that many Regionals before,” 
said Alexander. “As long as we come in and 
do our jobs, we’ll be fine.”
The Gators received the No. 2 seed in the 
Regional. Third-ranked Stanford was given the top seed and are one of nine teams that are ranked in the top 50. Florida is a combined 8-5 against the ranked teams in the field. 
“We just have to take care of business,” 
Alexander said. “We hope our game is in pretty good form, and if we make smart decisions, we should win.”
Florida ended the sea-
son well, with two first-
place finishes and one sec-ond-place finish and looks strong going into Region-
als. All-SEC first-team senior Tyson Alexan-der has been instrumental in many of UF’s successes this year.Tyson recently won the first individual 
title of his career in the second-to-last event of the season, as he shot a career low (63) in the first round of the BancorpSouth Intercol-legiate, finishing the tournament at 11-under par, one stroke off of his best tournament score. 
Last year at Regionals, Tyson had a solid 
finish shooting four-over par and finished tied for seventh place.
“As a whole we just need to keep our com-
posure,” Alexander said. “If we stay focused and continue to make smart decisions, I think we will fare pretty well in Regionals.”
