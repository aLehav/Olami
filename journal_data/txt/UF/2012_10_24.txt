Dustin White braced for im-
pact when he heard the rum-
ble of a car behind him. Soon after, the car’s mirror clipped him as he cycled along Willi-ston Road.
The president of Team Flor-
ida Cycling can readily recite about half a dozen times ve-hicles hit him and his friends while they were biking.
“I don’t think I know any-
one who has been riding for over year that hasn’t had an incident with a car,” he said.
To access concerns about 
cycling safety, the city released a public survey Monday to gather information about cy-cling accidents. The data will identify dangerous areas in Gainesville to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists.
White remembers an acci-
dent that left two UF students seriously injured, one un-conscious and another with a punctured lung.He said this study is a posi-
tive step toward keeping cy-
clists safe.
Debbie Leistner, the public 
works planning manager, said 
the city is looking at crash data, policies, transportation educa-tion and roadway engineering to develop the safety plan.
“We’re trying to get infor-
mation from the public,” Leist-ner said. “It’ll help us develop the plan.”
The city will also use guide-
lines on pedestrian and bike safety from the Federal High-
way Administration in the 
plan.
The survey focuses on all of 
Gainesville, but so far, the data 
has pointed to the four roads 
that surround UF as problem 
hot spots.
University Avenue, 13th 
Street, Archer Road and 34th 
Street are high-trafﬁ  c areas that return the highest number of incidents.
The survey looks at indi-
vidual pockets but also focuses on larger routes people some-times use to get across town.City-wide survey aims to increase cycling safety

Almost a month after Gainesville Po-
lice charged Pedro Bravo with the murder 
of Christian Aguilar, Bravo has decided to 
plead not guilty in the case. 
Following the written not-guilty plea 
ﬁ  led Friday, Bravo’s arraignment, planned 
for today, was canceled. 
His lawyer requested that prosecutors 
from the State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce begin to release evidence, also known as discov-ery, according to court documents from the Alachua County Clerk of Courts. 
This phase before the trial will give the 
defense the opportunity to review evi-dence collected from prosecutors to build a case.Police named Bravo a person of interest 
after Aguilar went missing Sept. 20. Bravo has been in Alachua County Jail since Sept. 24, when he was initially charged 
with depriving a victim of medical assistance. 
Since then, police re-
leased limited evidence which includes Bravo 
telling GPD detectives 
he beat Aguilar until he lost consciousness, and left him in a parking lot 
in northeast Gainesville.
Police also said they found Aguilar’s 
backpack in Bravo’s closet, a receipt that showed Bravo purchased a shovel and duct tape several days before Aguilar’s Bravo pleads not guilty in

Tonight, performers will face off at 
Gator Growl’s Talent Night in a new cat-
egory: singing the national anthem.
The talent show, which falls under the 
Homecoming theme “United We Growl,” is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. in the Re-itz Union Grand Ballroom. Attendees must 
pay $1 to enter, said director of Talent 
Night and advertising junior Lauren Her-stik, 21.
Groups and individuals will compete 
in the music, dance and national anthem categories. Participants include the Sedoc-
taves, DANZA and Girl Scout Troop 1029, 
according to the program.
“Song choice is everything,” said 
21-year-old materials science and engi-
neering junior Alex Greene, the musical di-
rector of No Southern Accent. “You want something that’s high energy.”
The winners of each Talent Night cat-
egory will perform at the pep rally Nov. 9. The national anthem champion will open 
the show, Herstik said.
Performers were selected through an 
audition process that began in September. 
Tonight, winners will be chosen by a panel of judges including Gators quarterback Jeff 
Driskel, she said.
This year, 50 percent of the proceeds 
will beneﬁ  t the Wounded Warriors Proj-
ect, a charity that helps the families of in-
jured soldiers. About $500 has been raised 
through audition fees, Herstik said.
The tap group Stomp the Swamp placed 
third in the dance category last year, said president and 21-year-old environmental 
engineering senior Lauren Kleiman.
But it’s not all about winning.
“Honestly, we’re just really, really ex-
cited to share what we can do with every-
one,” she said.Students sing off in talent show

Student Body President Tj Villamil 
encouraged student senators Tuesday 
to blow up social media platforms with information about the Okefeno-kee Oar.
The University of Georgia’s Stu-
dent Government and UF’s Student 
Government created the trophy in 2009, Villamil said. The Okefenokee 
Oar is a 10-foot paddle that goes to the 
winner of the Florida-Georgia game 
each year.
He said the oar is made from a 
1,000-year-old cypress tree from the 
Okefenokee Swamp, which sits on the border of Florida and Georgia.
The Florida-Georgia game has a 
reputation as “the world’s largest out-door cocktail party,” but both schools’ Student Government organizations 
are trying to take the focus off that 
title, Villamil said. Instead, they want to raise awareness about the “Battle for the Paddle” and the “War for the Oar.”
Villamil said UGA took the oar last 
year after winning the game and built a case in its Tate Student Center.
“I get reminded every single day 
that it sits in their union,” he said.
About two weeks ago, SG bought a 
case that sits on the first floor of the 
Reitz Union, Villamil said after the 
meeting.
Information and Communication 
Committee Chairwoman Jamie Low-setter also encouraged senators to 
spread awareness of the oar.
“We are the best school,” she said. 
“Why should we not have it?”

The Career Resource Center will host the 
Graduate & Professional Schools Day from 
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursday in the Reitz Union Grand and Rion Ballrooms.
More than 160 programs from throughout 
the nation, including law, medical and phar -
macy schools, will attend, said Angel Iverson, assistant director for career events at the CRC. Admissions representatives will be available to network with attendees and answer questions about financial aid, campus life and admission processes, she said.
Heather White, CRC director, said students 
will benefit from the event.
“I think it’s a great way to find out more 
about programs and schools of interest without even leaving campus, which is remarkable,” she said.
Iverson said she suggests students research 
programs they’re interested in, prepare ques-tions and bring resumes. A Gator 1 Card is re-quired for entrance.
Iverson said the event is geared toward ju-
niors and seniors, but she encouraged freshmen and sophomores to attend.
“Freshmen and sophomores can get a head 
start on asking what they should be doing now so they can set themselves up for success when applying to graduate school in the future,” she said.
Liz Cox, a 21-year-old communication sci-
ences and disorders senior, said she wants to at-tend the event to learn more about options for her future.
“The job field is so competitive now, and go-
ing to grad school makes you stand out,” she said.Juniors, seniors

People can celebrate UF’s push to go 
green on the Reitz Union North Lawn to-day with a carnival-themed Campus Sus-tainability Day.
The Office of Sustainability is sponsor -
ing the event, which will run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., along with about 10 student or -
ganizations to raise awareness about sus-tainability on campus.
Each organization will have a booth 
with information on the group and on go-ing green.
Every organization’s booth will fea-ture carnival-style games, said Laurel Nesbit, program assistant for the Office of Sustainability.
To continue with the trend of sustain-
ability , Nesbit said the carnival games will be made out of repurposed materials due to the organizations’ small budgets.
“Their budgets are small but their 
imaginations are big,” she said.
Allison Goldberg, a 19-year-old UF geography sophomore specializing in environmental geosciences and president of Gators for a Sustainable Campus, said students need to care about sustainability on campus.
Goldberg said she has seen many cam-
pus organizations reach out to Gators for a Sustainable Campus and ask how their organization can recycle.
“I just hope that people understand 
more the implications of being wasteful,” she said. “I feel that having so many var -
ied organizations together will help create more unity to show that sustainability is big on campus, and hopefully that will 
translate into some kind of activism.” Sustainability event features student clubs

Last year UGA took the oar“We’re trying to reach all demo-
graphics with this,” said Dekova Bat-
ey, the bicycle pedestrian coordinator for the city of Gainesville.
Batey said the safety project start-
ed in late spring and was brought to the city’s Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory Board in September. 
The survey is its first form of public 
outreach.
“Right now, we’re doing a lot of 
data analyzation,” Batey said. “We’re looking at hot spot areas of concern to make sure we target certain areas.”
White said the problem with safety may lie in the tight roadways. He said drivers can be negligent by just pass-ing cyclists.
“They don’t see people laying in a 
hospital breathing through a tube af-ter getting hit by a car,” he said. “They just need to get from point A to point B as fast as possible.”  
The survey can be found at www.
surveymonkey.com/s/Gainesville-Pedestrian-Bike-Safety.
It will be up until Dec. 21 and will 
be available in an online digital format, a QR code for smartphones and also in print at facilities like public libraries.

Despite UF’s recent on-cam-
pus cat problem, experts say 
Alachua County is home to a normal amount of feral felines.
Recently , UF had an issue 
with feral cats roaming the busi-ness college. This influenced perception of the number of cats in Gainesville as a whole, said Shaye Olmstead, executive director of Operation Catnip, a nonprofit organization that traps, neuters and releases cats.
About 40,000 unowned cats 
in the county is consistent with other places of similar human population and climate, she said.
“We don’t have any statisti-
cally significant dumping hap-pening in Alachua County as opposed to anywhere else,” she said.
While the cat population 
isn’t unique, more programs than ever that exist to manage 
feral cats, Olmstead said.
The UF College of Veteri-
nary Medicine loans space to 
Operation Catnip, Olmstead said, and the organization has trained about 800 veterinary students how to trap, neuter and return cats.
Olmstead said some people 
blame college students for moving around and leaving pet cats behind, but the main issue is simpler than that.
“It’s just a result of genera-
tions of people not spaying and neutering their pets,” she said.
Operation Catnip sterilizes 
about 3,000 Alachua County cats each year, Olmstead said, and has conducted about 36,000 spays and neuters since it opened in 1990. Spaying 
and neutering of any Alachua 
County feline is free.
Many of the cats that Opera-
tion Catnip operates on come from Alachua County Animal Services. This month, animal services sent 99 cats to the or -
ganization, said Vernon Saw-yer, interim director of Alachua 
County Animal Services. Ap-
proximately 41 of them were euthanized.
Throughout the last 10 years, 
cat intakes and cat euthanasia have decreased, Olmstead said, but she and Sawyer strongly recommend that Gainesville residents get their animals 
spayed and neutered to stabi-
lize and reduce the feral feline population.
“It’s a humane way to con-
trol the population,” Olmstead said.

A section of UF’s campus will be 
colored with Florida-grown orange 
pumpkins, yellow squashes and striped gourds from today until Friday.
The UF Horticultural Sciences Grad-
uate Student Club will have about 200 pumpkins and other gourds for sale from 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day at 
Fifield Hall on Hull Road.
“We will have all kinds of pump-
kins, from edibles to carving to decora-
tive,” said Gerardo Nunez, the gradu-ate representative for the club.
The 24-year-old Ph.D. candidate in 
horticultural sciences said the proceeds will help club members travel around the world to present their research.
He said the UF North Florida Re-search and Education Center and the UF Partnership for Water, Agriculture 
and Community donated the pump-
kins. The sale is the club’s biggest Fall fundraiser.
Nunez said buying from fellow stu-
dents and knowing the funds support research are incentives to purchase pumpkins on campus.
“We would like people to come and 
meet the kind of folks that are growing 
the food we eat,” he said.
Plus, Nunez said, the price is right.
“We always price the pumpkins 
lower than the stores,” he said. “All of these pumpkins have been grown by 
people from UF and in the state. That 
is something you won’t find if you buy your pumpkins from a large super -
market.”
Tessa Keskinen, a 20-year-old envi-
ronmental science and sustainability 
studies junior, said she wants to sup-
port the students.
“I think that doing a seasonal fund-
raiser is a pretty cool thing,” she said.UF club sells pumpkins

What does it mean to be an American? If 
you ask Kole Odutola, being a U.S. citizen 
isn’t enough.
“Is carrying an American passport all one 
requires to be an American?” he asked.
Odutola, a UF professor in the languages, 
literatures and cultures department, is origi-nally from Nigeria. He discussed his book, “Diaspora and Imagined Nationality,” as part of a dialogue on nationalism at the Civic Media Center Tuesday evening. Eight people attended the event.
Odutola, who has studied nationalism for 
nearly eight years, researched how Nigeri-ans define themselves for his doctorate. dis-sertation. Although his research focused on Nigerians, he said it can be applied to any country.
“I expect this work to be used and applied 
in the American system,” he said.
Odutola said he believes citizens need to 
learn what nationalism really means before they can call a country their own.
“The concepts of nationhood, nationality 
and nationalism demand deep reflection,” he 
said.
He believes citizens should educate them-
selves, know their rights and strive for excel-
lence. He said young people should put in as much energy as possible toward understand-ing their heritages and cultures.
“Students should be proud of their out-
put,” he said.
Jane Pollack, a 21-year-old Santa Fe Col-
lege dance student, said she heard about the event at a Nigerian Independence Day party. She thinks people need to keep their minds 
open to the full meaning of nationalism.
“I really enjoy talking with people about 
this stuff,” she said. “I’m always interested in 
how people create their own culture.”UF professor hosts discussion

Bravo now has a public defender
disappearance and blood inside Bravo’s 2004 
Chevrolet Blazer.
On Oct. 12, police said two hunters found 
a body in Levy County. Three days later, the Eighth Judicial Circuit Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed through dental records that the body was Aguilar’s.
On Monday, attorneys from the Law Of-
fices of Larry Gibbs Turner, P .L., filed an or -
der, removing themselves from the case. They were replaced by the Office of the Public De-fender, according to court records. 
Ron Kozlowski, one of Bravo’s former at-
torneys, said the cost of a potentially lengthy trial influenced the family’s decision to utilize a public defender.
“They decided, considering their modest means, they couldn’t afford private counsel for the case,” he said.
Alan Chipperfield, an assistant public de-
fender, will represent Bravo in the case. 
Bravo and Chipperfield 
will be called before Judge Mark Moseley at 2 p.m. 
Nov . 28, according the 
Clerk of Courts’ website. 
As the case moves to 
trial, Kozlowski mentioned 
the continued suffering 
of the Aguilar and Bravo 
families.
“I just hope both families can find some 
peace when this is all over,” he said, “It’s been 
hard on everybody.”

Gainesville doesn’t seem like the place for 
someone who went to the University of Geor -
gia, Clemson and the University of Tennes-
see.
But Mike Byerly said he’s used his degrees 
from rival schools to bolster the Gator Nation for the past 12 years as the District 1 represen-tative for the Alachua County Commission.
As a commissioner, he supported an in-
creased bus service, assistance programs for low-income residents and land preservation.
If elected for another term Nov . 6, Byerly 
said he hopes to invest more in transportation, infrastructure and land conservation.
The self-described environmentalist said he 
got into politics when he began to see the rest of the state develop in a way that destroyed natural resources.
“I was concerned about the way I saw the 
community growing and developing,” Byerly said, “seeing people sort of thoughtlessly de-stroying things in Alachua County that make it a really beautiful place.”
He also puts emphasis on transportation, 
including public transit, bike lanes and pedes-trian areas.
As an avid bicyclist, he pushed for bike 
lanes near downtown and campus.
He also envisions an update to the Region-
al Transit System. He and the Gainesville City Commission support transforming the tran-sit into a Bus Rapid Transit system, which is 
expected to speed up transportation through 
bus-only lanes and priority for buses at traffic lights.
However, the county changed its votes and 
moved to let the tax money go only to roads and other construction projects. He said his vi-sion for Alachua County spreads further than that, which is why he no longer supports the ballot measure.
“The way the County Commission has 
structured it, people living in Gainesville aren’t getting a very good deal,” Byerly said. “They will pay the bulk of the actual tax, but by a 2-1 margin the money is going to be spent outside of the City of Gainesville.”
Aside from roads and buses, Byerly said he 
is especially proud of the county’s partnership with UF, Santa Fe College and local business-es, especially with Florida Innovation Hub at UF and Innovation Square.
But the innovation initiatives aren’t the 
only reasons Byerly expects to see more peo-ple migrate to Alachua County.
He said county investments in land conser -
vation, recreation areas and alternative meth-
ods of transportation have created a diverse 
community for a county this size.
“All these things are the kind of things that 
people with talent and ability are attracted to, and it’s obviously paying off,” Byerly said.
While he hopes the innovation economy 
will bring more people and businesses to the county , Byerly said his main objective is still to make sure the county grows in a responsible 
way.
“Growth is going to happen, we know 
that,” Byerly said. “But with that comes some 
thought and planning. We can grow and de-velop while preserving the best of what we have as a community.”

John Martin doesn’t mind dancing to his 
own beat — especially at Gator basketball 
games.
Fans know him as Mr. Trombone, a tribute 
to a lively air-trombone dance Martin does 
when the Gator band plays “You Can Call Me 
Al.”
But Martin said he hopes to be known for 
another accolade this fall by winning the Dis-trict 1 seat in the Alachua County Commis-sion.
Though the Republican will face 12-year 
County Commission incumbent Mike Byerly on Election Day Nov. 6, he said he’ll add a 
fresh perspective to the job.
“Being a property owner and a business 
owner, I’m getting hit with huge taxes,” Mar -
tin said. “I’m just fed up.”He hopes to create a slimmer government 
in Alachua County, as well as entice business-
es to the area by removing regulations and certain taxes.
During his 13-year stint with the Haw-
thorne City Commission, he pushed to fin-ish the town’s sewer system, provided the first-ever retirement plan to Hawthorne city employees and fought to keep water transfer rights in North Florida.
He has a series of grievances to air with the 
County Commission, which he said has been headed by mostly Democrats for more than a decade.
One of Martin’s biggest complaints is 
county business regulations, which he said have stifled Alachua County’s economy and have driven talent out of Gainesville.
He said between building codes and land 
development laws, businesses are voting with their feet to leave the county.
“They’re so cumbersome the County Com-
mission can’t even review it themselves,” Martin said. “They actually have more rules than they can enforce right now.”
He points to Florida Innovation Hub at UF, 
where the city and county removed barriers to entice businesses to roust in Gainesville.
In an ideal Alachua County , Martin would 
like to see these rules and regulations slimmed down and updated every few years through an idea he calls “zero-balancing.” Every few years, the commission would keep the rules it is required to have by the state, but it would 
have to vote and rejustify additional rules the 
county added.
“I want to innovate Alachua County,” he 
said.
Martin would also like to apply the same 
concept to the county’s budget: Calculate the cost of core services like a police force and infrastructure, then vote to fund additional county programs with the leftover money.
Martin said he would also like to combine 
some government agencies to save time and employees. An example would be to merge 
the environmental protection agency into a 
division of the growth management.
Martin said he thinks students should vote 
fiscal conservatives to the commission to move the county into the future.
“But I think students should look at poli-
cies that are business-friendly and attract the types of businesses that could allow them to stay here,” Martin said.

Why can’t we just let sleeping zingers lie?
On Monday night, the third presidential debate 
was in Boca Raton — a city known for being the host 
of Mitt Romney’s “47 percent” remarks.
Now that social media is a lot more popular, or something, 
than it was during the 2008 election, jokes and remarks are more 
likely to get repeated and blown out of proportion.
Luckily for us, these debates allow voters to see who the can-
didates really are; they also show us how the candidates would act in a verbal ﬁ  ght in front of friends, family and millions of Americans.
What’s the difference between a gaffe and a zing? We all 
know that Romney practiced many “zingers” for the ﬁ  rst de-bate, but those quippy comments may have been more relevant 
in the second and third debates.
Romney’s “binders full of women” remark was offensive 
and weird and terrible, and it’s basically all we remember from 
that debate. How can someone so out of touch with how people want to be treated expect to win the respect of millions of voters? The memorable moment from the last presidential debate came from our very own President Obama.
“You mentioned the Navy, for example — that we have few-
er ships than we did in 1916,” Obama said during the debate, 
“Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, be-
cause the nature of our military’s changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land … we have ships that go underwater — nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of ‘Battleship,’ where we’re counting ships.”
This hilarious statement offended people like Dan Riker, who 
is from a military surplus outlet, Bayonet Inc. in Georgia.
“[Bayonets] are still distributed to the military all the time,” 
Riker said in a TMZ article. “He should get educated on it.”
The president obviously didn’t mean to offend a minority of 
our population with his remark. If Romney thinks the president is scaling down the military, then Obama was trying to explain how the military’s needs have changed. And don’t worry, be-cause horses are still being used, too.
“Horse-mounted U.S. commandos played a pivotal role in 
the toppling of the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan in 2001,” said Peter Grier, a writer for the Christian Science Moni-tor.
People took Obama’s statement seriously so quickly . And 
while, yeah, he’s our leader, so we should take what he says se-riously, he’s also a human being. He’s allowed to be ﬂ  ippant and awesome. The difference between “horses and bayonets” and “binders full of women” is the tone.
Obama didn’t try to undermine the use those weapons once 
had, but Romney couldn’t understand that human beings don’t appreciate being compartmentalized.
Everybody seems to focus on the words Obama said instead 
of the idea and intent behind them. His intent was to counteract 
what Romney tried to characterize as a bad military decision.
Just chill out, everybody. Instead, focus on educating your-
self before the election.
ESPN College GameDay unites campus
That one day a week when an entire campus rejoices 
— from students and alumni to residents and fans, the university becomes alive on football Saturdays. 
While I believe athletics should not dominate an entire cam-pus and that academics should remain the primary focus, football provides an extraordinary outlet for uniting people from all backgrounds.
Each week, there is a certain buzz in the air. The excite-
ment on campus about our beloved Gators serves as an overwhelmingly positive presence. In light of a bitter elec-tion season, in which presidential politics have divided us about the future course of our nation, for many it has been football, not politics or religion, that has kept UF united and proud. In such uncertain times, these attributes are so scarce. It appears that college campuses like UF effectively unite people with distinct backgrounds and beliefs. We all can learn something from this. By focusing on what unites us and our common goals, we can truly make a difference.
This focus essentially came alive Saturday. Whether it 
is rational to camp out overnight to appear on national TV , I do not know. However, actions such as camping out for ESPN College GameDay do, in fact, demonstrate that ex-citement and pride for a common entity and foster a unique type of creativity that we can use to create solutions to our issues.
The wide array of posters captured an immense sense 
of creativity and an overall awareness of culture, social norms and trends. From posters stating “Spurrier Uses Ins-tagram,” to “Muschamp Style,” these creative and innova-tive works demonstrate that we all possess the imagination and originality necessary to develop solutions to unique problems and to analyze social norms. If our elected ofﬁ  -cials employed this sense of creativity in making policy, we would have developed simple yet efﬁ  cient solutions to our complex problems.  No College GameDay poster depicts this fact more than the one that pictured a South Carolina cheerleader holding a sign for the Gamecocks. The caption, of course, said, “Your parents must be so proud.” According to the creator of this masterpiece, the idea was “surprisingly creative and just came to me.” Preferring to remain anonymous, this cre-ative force hopes to use his newly found skill to make an impact by assisting in advertising for vari-
ous campus organizations, including “Gators for Romney.” The witty, yet perverse nature of these posters shows us that each and every one of us has the critical thinking skills needed to make an array of impacts.
With respect to the presidential election, the polls remain 
tied. Media projections of the Electoral College show that it is President Obama’s race to lose. However, another push in Gov. Romney’s favor could potentially put him into the White House. Debate season has come and gone. Undecid-ed voters should promptly make up their minds. Politically speaking, our country seems exceedingly polarized.
Quite frankly, the unique sense of humor present in 
these signs for College GameDay make us all smile. In an era of such economic uncertainty, the presence of football on campus has provided an entire city with a sense of hope and improved prospects for the future.
Presidential politics have divided us. Such a bitter, gru-
eling and tenuous campaign has seemed to widen divisions within the public. Such controversy fails to demonstrate the creative skill and originality that we all share.
The least likely of things — fan signs — tell us that if we 
can spend the time to create such witty and clever machi-nations for a TV show, we can surely apply these skills to create a meaningful impact to make a difference in the community.  After all, if we do this, our parents will be so proud.

An article in “The Gainesville Iguana” 
newsletter pointed out an article by Noam 
Chomsky with the same title as this edito-
rial. I read it and realized this information needs to 
be shared. We have all been fed by various news media outlets that Iran is the “Great Satan,” intent 
on destroying Israel with its accumulation of a nu-
clear arsenal. During the ﬁ  nal presidential debate, 
both candidates pointed out Iran’s danger. How-
ever, let’s consider a scenario in which we reverse the accusations thrown on Iran:
“Iran is carrying out a murderous and destruc-
tive, low-level war against Israel with great-power 
participation. Throughout, Iran enjoys the support 
of its superpower patron. Iranian leaders are there-
fore announcing their intention to bomb Israel, and 
prominent Iranian military analysts report that the attack may happen before the U.S. elections. Iran 
can use its powerful air force and new submarines sent by Germany , armed with nuclear missiles and 
stationed off the coast of Israel. Whatever the time-table, Iran is counting on its superpower backer to 
join if not lead the assault. U.S. defense secretary 
Leon Panetta says that while we do not favor such 
an attack, as a sovereign country Iran will act in its 
best interests.”
Chomsky paints this picture and states that this 
is probably unimaginable, but it’s actually happen-
ing. Just switch out some 
characters and reality 
presents itself. Just like the 
U.S., Israel uses violence whenever it deems neces-sary . It continues illegal settlement in “Palestinian 
territories” defying international law and the U.N. 
Security Council.  Israel imprisoned and killed 
thousands of Gazans throughout the years.
“Thirty years ago, Israel destroyed an Iraqi nu-
clear reactor, an act that has recently been praised, avoiding the strong evidence, even from U.S. in-
telligence, that the bombing did not end Saddam 
Hussein’s nuclear weapons program but rather 
initiated it. Bombing of Iran might have the same 
effect,” Chomsky wrote. And, have we forgotten 
that under the shah of Iran, the U.S. supported 
nuclear development programs there?
Of course, Iran carried out aggression in the 
past and deﬁ  nitely has its share of guilt. The Irani-an government is repressive, just like the U.S. allies 
in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, its most impor-
tant ally , has not supported the Arab Spring in its 
country — in case you have not noticed.
So, Chomsky asks, “Why then is Iran the great-
est threat to world peace, as seen in ofﬁ  cial Western discourse? The primary reason is acknowledged 
by U.S. military and intelligence and their Israeli 
counterparts: Iran might deter the resort to force 
by the United States and Israel.”
He adds, “Furthermore, Iran must be punished 
for its ‘successful deﬁ  ance,’ which was Washing-
ton’s charge against Cuba half a century ago and 
still the driving force for the U.S. assault against Cuba that continues despite international condem-
nation.”
The moral of the story? Be careful what you 
hear, and be critical. The U.S. and Israel are very 
powerful governments with bigger nuclear arse-
nals than Iran.  During this election season, we will 
continue to hear many fear tactics.  But, we have 
the ability to look at information critically , calmly 
and fairly — just like Noam Chomsky .

Speaking OutI’ve got some alarming news: You are dying.
Well, technically, everyone is dying, so don’t panic 
just yet. 
We can’t help it. 
Our immune systems combat the trend toward entropy 
as best they can, but we all eventually lose the battle. 
No living thing escapes the iron grip of death — not even 
the beautifully efﬁ  cient and organic machines we call bod-ies. 
But I’m not talking medicine yet. I’m talking some seri-
ous, metaphysical Bible stuff here.
If you’re a human, chances are you have a congenital 
“heart” condition called sin. 
The bad news is it’s 100 percent fatal.Think of sin like a spiritual disease, stealing life from and 
eventually killing its host. 
You might scoff at the notion, but the Bible isn’t the only 
piece of literature arguing that something is terribly wrong with us. 
Take a walk down the self-help aisle of any bookstore on 
the planet. 
We know we’re screwed up, even if we don’t want to face 
the implications of our guilt.
Some would say our moral disease is akin to the common 
cold. 
Their remedy: rest up a bit, drink some philosophical or-
ange juice and give it a week or two before things get bet-ter. 
Others would liken our moral disease to inﬂ  uenza: You’ll 
feel the pain of recovery as your body ﬁ  ghts off the infec-
tion, but most get better, even if there are casualties along 
the way.
We’ve greatly underestimated sin, though. We look at our pride, lust, deception and arrogance and 
think that we’ll magically recover by willing ourselves to be better. 
But infection doesn’t work quite that way, and it seems 
that God is the only one who really understands how deadly a force is within us.
Sin is cancer. Those who have it face death, unless they take drastic 
measures. The good news is that sin is not 
the end of the story.  
Enter Jesus Christ, deus ex 
machina incarnate.  
He was perfection clothed in hu-
man ﬂ  esh and far more than just a moral teacher.  
He was God, the answer to the 
prayers of a dying world, even if 
the people weren’t aware of it.
Jesus knew that humankind deserved God’s wrath.  He was aware of our brutality and murder, our lying and 
lust, and the rebellion that made us God’s enemies.  
He saw the wickedness of our condemned hearts before 
we could act on it, and all of it grieved him.  
Jesus knew justice demanded payment for our sin, so he 
paid the price.  
He was executed in horriﬁ  c fashion, taking the punish-
ment of criminals even though he wasn’t guilty.
He was whipped and beaten, nailed to a cross and died as 
he was forsaken by his father.  
The real pain came when he was laden with all of our sin 
and its consequences, suffering the weight of all of our evil.  
He paid the price because he knew that we couldn’t.Jesus’ message is this: I was so bad that he had to die, but 
I am so loved that he gladly did.  
When was the last time you saw a superhero story where 
the hero dies for the villain?
It’s a loaded concept for a limited column, but in effect, 
the God of the mountain comes down to carry mankind to 
the top.  
This is the means by which a loving God reconciles his 
people. 
This is the method that allows for the removal of our can-
cerous hearts to be replaced by the pristine heart of God.  
It is the overturning of the death sentence and the guar-
antee of life, should one decide to admit his or her guilt and 
accept this gift.
I don’t know what you’ve heard about Jesus, but that is 
really good news.

Science and art may seem worlds apart, 
but a UF graduate student is fusing the two.
Jorge Pérez Gallego, a third-year fine arts 
graduate student with a concentration in 
graphic design, used his doctorate in astron-
omy to further his advancements in the art 
world with his “SCIENCESTORE” exhibit, which is opening in UF’s Focus Gallery to-day.
The gallery, in Fine Arts C, will house 
Gallego’s exhibit through Nov. 9 and will be open to the public on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The exhibit will be a store that, essential-
ly, sells science, he said. 
Gallego will staff the store and discuss 
the design aspects of science. It will be an interactive performance.
Gallego set up his store exhibit with col-
orful graphic posters depicting quotes from scientists like Carl Sagan. These posters and the interactive photo 
booth are to find out attendees’ ideas on what science and art are separately and to-gether, he said.
Gallego said his purpose for the exhibit 
is to show visitors that science means more than the commodity it has become.
“I’ll be bothering my clients like a Best 
Buy guy trying to sell you a printer,” the 32-year-old said. “I want to see how people react and go along with me trying to sell them science in a can.”
Although he won’t actually sell the silver 
containers labeled with element names and scientific theories, Gallego wants to see oth-ers’ viewpoints on science.
Gallego’s concept is unusual, said Brian 
Slawson, a UF graphic design associate pro-fessor.
“Not only is Jorge using this installation 
as an interactive platform, but he’s also per -
forming within the project,” Slawson said. “That’s not something the typical design student does.”8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2012

UF alumnus and president of Daytona 
International Speedway Joie Chitwood III 
spoke in the Florida Gym during a segment of the Eric Friedheim Tourism Institute’s dis-tinguished speaker series Tuesday. He told 
students about his professional background 
and giving them career advice.
At one point, Chitwood paused, looked 
around at the room full of UF students, and asked them “When you guys leave your col-lege careers, who is going to be in sales?”Two out of about 60 raised their hands.“I have news for you: Every single per -
son in this room is in sales,” he said. “You 
are selling yourself every single day to the 
people you work with.”
Michael Odio, a 27-year-old sport man-
agement, Ph.D. candidate said speakers help professors stay connected and pass along stories.
He said Chitwood provided insight about 
what it’s like to work in sports — knowl-edge that’s most effective when delivered 
by someone in the industry.
Chitwood graduated with a finance de-
gree in 1992 and then got his master’s in 
business adminstration from the University of South Florida. 
Odio said he thinks it’s helpful for stu-dents to listen and talk to Chitwood and other successful alumni who were once in their shoes.
“It shows that you can be there,” Odio 
said.
After college, Chitwood worked with the 
Walt Disney World Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway and the International Speedway Corp. He was president of Indianapolis Mo-tor Speedway before he became the presi-dent of Daytona International Speedway.“You have to be relentless. You have to 
be shameless. You have to be unapologetic,” he told the audience.
Danielle Greenstein and Michael Potter, 
both 21-year-old sport management seniors, said that was the most valuable lesson they learned from Chitwood’s speech.
“You’ve got to figure out how you’re 
going to outwork the person next to you,” Chitwood told the attendees.
He recommended students develop good 
public speaking skills and be prepared to 
have opinions.
Chitwood said lucky opportunities come 
from hard work and preparation.
“I’m responsible for my own success and 
my own failure,” he said. “No one will do it 
for me.”Daytona speedway president tells students to be relentless

Her face can melt hearts.
Rich auburn hair accentuates her 
amber eyes, which search the world with playful curiosity.
A permanent smile rests on her 
face, and it seems to spread wider every time the 3-year-old meets someone new.
The only thing strange about her 
appearance is her periwinkle-col-ored tongue and the bald patches on her side and legs.
Though Mushi, a 3-year-old 
Chow Chow mix, is calm now, her 
owner, Dan Kahn, said she’s been 
fighting for her life.
Mushi was hit by a car Oct. 9 after 
digging her way under Kahn’s fence while he was at work. She spent al-most a week at UF’s Small Animal Hospital, recovering from severe lung injuries, multiple gashes and a damaged hip and shoulder.
“It’s been a crazy, wild roller -
coaster of a week,” Kahn said.
Kahn first learned about Mushi’s 
accident when he got a series of fran-tic phone calls from friends. He sped to the hospital to find Mushi barely conscious.
But her personality couldn’t be 
dampened by medications. When 
she saw him, Mushi lifted two of 
her legs and exposed her belly so he could scratch it.
“It was the first time I’ve ever 
heard her whine,” Kahn said.
She had an oxygen tube fed down to her lungs to keep her breathing. After several days and surgeries, Kahn brought Mushi home. She brought a $7,000 vet bill with her — about $1,000 a day.
Kahn said it’s been difficult to 
pay off the debt, mainly because he doesn’t earn much at his job. He provides free and discounted legal 
services through Three Rivers Legal 
Services Inc.
A group of Kahn’s friends host-
ed a charity concert for Mushi at Loosey’s Downtown and raised $1,242 to help pay the medical bills. They also set up a donation page called “Love for Dan & Mushi” at YouCaring.com.
Mark Archer, a Gainesville resi-
dent who said he’s known Kahn for about a year, is impressed with Kahn’s selfless nature and service to the community.
“He’s one of the nicest, coolest 
guys you’ll ever meet,” Archer said.
Though the concert was a suc-
cess, Kahn said he had to reach out 
to family members for hasty loans.
“It’s really hard for me to ask for 
money,” Kahn said.
But Kahn swallowed his pride for 
Mushi, who was 10 days old when 
he met her. In 2009, Kahn walked into one of his favorite stores and noticed something different.
“I saw this fuzzy piglet of a dog 
on top of a kitten cage in the back of the store,” Kahn said.
The dog was found in a Micano-
py parking lot after a hawk tried to scoop her up with its talons, pierc-ing her sides.
She was checked out by a vet 
and given to a store owner tempo-rarily . The employees called the dog Maggie, after the maggots that sometimes wriggled in her wounds. The vet couldn’t give her stitches because she was too small. Formula food would dribble out of the holes in her belly.
Kahn left the store that day dog-
less but couldn’t get the puppy out of his mind. He decided to foster her for eight weeks, which turned into an adoption about a month later.
“She’s a tough little monster,” 
Kahn said. “But she loves people.”
Before the car accident, Mushi as-
sumed the role of protector-in-chief. She’d patrol the yard to make sure raccoons and opossums knew they weren’t welcome on her turf. She’s still too weak to command 
her normal post with a thick cast on her right front leg, but Kahn said his house feels more like home again with his best friend around.
“The squirrels know she’s back,” 
Kahn said.

“Tebowing” is now trade-
marked.
New York Jets backup quarter -
back and former Gator Tim Tebow 
was granted the rights for the down-
on-one-knee praying position ear -
lier this month. In an ESPN article, 
Tebow said he intends to control the use of the term and meaning behind it rather than to gain financially.
Richard J. Lutz, UF marketing 
professor, said a trademark is the only way for Tebow to legally con-trol the term, especially because others have attempted to obtain the rights for commercial purposes in the past.
“Obviously, it’s a huge phenom-
enon,” Lutz said.
He said without full trademark 
rights, perversions of the term are 
possible and could reflect badly on 
Tebow.
“People don’t know who 
owns what,” Lutz said. “If they see ‘Tebow,’ then they think it’s Tebow.”
Steve Russell, sports director at 
WRUF radio, said some fans admire Tebow not only because he is a foot-
ball player, but also because of his principles.
“If you’re looking at it from Tim’s 
perspective, he’s trying to protect 
what he feels it 
represents, and 
from his perspec-tive, I certainly 
understand it,” 
Russell said.
However, it 
may be difficult to enforce the trademark among 
Gators fans, Russell said, and it may hurt average fans who do the “Tebowing” move as a way to pay 
homage.Rebisi Owhonda, a 19-year-old 
biology sophomore, said he thinks 
the trademark will affect the pres-ence of “Tebowing” on social media sites.
“It’s going to be a harm, because 
people can’t actively and openly use 
it anymore,” he said.
“Tebowing” could be used to 
sell hats and T-shirts, toy guns and 
pantyhose, according to an ESPN article. 
Tebow told ESPN the money 
from those sales would eventually go to the Tim Tebow Foundation. Russell said it is no surprise to him 
that Tebow wants to donate the funds.
“Knowing Tim, I think that was 
important to him — that if there was 
any profit to be made, so to speak, the money would go to his founda-tion,” he said.
Lutz said the trademark could 
have a similar effect to the scriptures Tebow wore under his eyes during many Gators games. People might see the term and want to find out its meaning, which could be exactly what Tebow wants.
“I think most people would look 
at what he’s doing and say he has the right to do that,” Lutz said. “It’s 
his name.”

With two center backs 
injured, UF is asking Lauren Smith to step in at a position she’s never played before. See story, page 14.  
Beisel Picks Up Weekly Award
Elizabeth Beisel earned Southeastern Conference 
Female Swimmer of the Week honors after notching four top-three ﬁ  nishes at the SMU Classic last weekend.George Earns Preseason All-SEC Honor

  When Jeff Driskel drops back to 
pass in practice, offensive coordi-
nator Brent Pease becomes a pass 
rusher. 
  The 6-foot-2 Pease, wearing 
large arm pads to emulate dynamic defensive ends like 6-foot-6 Jade-
veon Clowney, slaps at Driskel’s 
arms to try to teach him a lesson: 
Don’t be a violator. 
  Defensive coordinator Dan 
Quinn coined the term “violators” toward the end of last season to 
describe players who are prone to 
fumbles because of the way they 
carry the ball.  
  The coaches’ emphasis on 
avoiding giveaways has paid divi-dends so far in 2012, as Florida 
ranks second nationally with only four turnovers. 
   “If there’s one stat you really 
chart every week, it’s ball secu-
rity,” Pease said. “Outside of win-
ning, there’s really one goal board we have that we look at. It’s our 
turnover margin.”
  The Gators have avoided turn-
overs in four of their seven games 
this season largely due to the ef-
forts of Driskel, who has thrown 
only one interception in 127 pass attempts. 
  Pease has called a conservative, 
run-heavy offense this season to make Driskel’s job easier in his ﬁ  rst season as a starter. 
  Pease is becoming more aggres-sive as Driskel gains experience, 
but the reliability of kicker Caleb 
Sturgis often leads to conserva-
tive play-calling inside the 35-yard 
line.
   “You want to be aggressive, but you’ve got to develop a trust,” 
Pease said. “[Driskel is] gaining 
that.”
  Said Driskel: “When you have a 
defense like we do, you don’t have 
to force anything, and you don’t 
have to try to score on every play.”
  While the lack of interceptions 
can be traced to play-calling, Flori-
da’s resistance to fumbles was born 
in practice. 
  UF’s coaches have consistently 
put an emphasis on carrying the ball high and tight. 
  “It’s the No. 1 fundamental: 
how you’re holding the football,” 
Pease said. “We stress that.”
  The Gators run drills to work 
on ball security twice each week. When the rest of the team works 
on special teams, the quarterbacks 
have additional time to practice 
preventing turnovers. 
  Included is a turnover circuit, 
where quarterbacks try avoiding 
defensive linemen, stepping up in 
the pocket and running in the open 
ﬁ  eld. 
  “We try to work on all those 
game-type situations,” Pease said. 
  Said coach Will Muschamp: “It 
goes back to what you emphasize 
is what’s important, and you can’t just talk about it, you have to drill 
it. It’s something we work on with 
our players.”

Jeff Driskel gets sacked during UF’s 44-11 win against South Carolina on Saturday in The Swamp. Although 
Driskel failed to eclipse 100 passing yards for the third straight game, he has only one interception in 2012. 
Ball security strong for Driskel, Gators offense in 2012 
UF has made only four turnovers
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Jeff Driskel threw four touchdowns 
against South Carolina, but he couldn’t 
reach triple-digit passing yards.
  He hasn’t done that in three 
games.
  Florida gained a season-low 183 
yards on Saturday. 
  But the sophomore quarterback 
doesn’t care, and neither do his coach-es.
  “If you come into this thing every 
week asking me about yards, I mean, I’m not really concerned about that,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease 
said. “I’m concerned about winning, 
efﬁ  ciency in the red zone, third-down conversions, (and) ball security.”
  If that’s the case, Driskel and the 
Gators offense are having a banner year.
  Florida’s ﬁ  rst-year starter at quar-
terback ranks ﬁ  fth in passing efﬁ  cien-cy in the Southeastern Conference.
  UF converted 47 percent of its 
third-down chances against top-10 op-ponents South Carolina and LSU. UF is eighth in the nation with a plus-11 turnover margin. Last season, Florida 
ﬁ  nished 113th of 120 teams with a mi-
nus-12 margin.
  Florida averaged only 2.8 yards 
per play on Saturday, but the Gators 
didn’t have much ground to cover. Four ﬁ  rst-half drives started within 
the South Carolina 30-yard line.
  Florida ﬁ  nished the ﬁ  rst half with 
21 points and 29 yards. 
  “Now I’m looking at it as, ‘Are we 
scoring?’ We better be scoring touch-downs on that,” Pease said. “So, I’m not protecting what we do or any-thing, but yeah, I think it’s misleading  UF wants points, not yardsFIRE JOE MORGAN
  On Saturday, a football game played 
in Jacksonville will actually matter.
  This year’s showdown between 
Florida and Georgia is a bigger deal than the other recent installments in the storied rivalry. 
For the ﬁ  rst time since 2008, both the 
Gators and the Bulldogs are ranked in the Top 10 of the BCS standings as they enter their annual meeting.
  Even more intriguing are the stakes.  The winner of this game will clinch the 
Southeastern Conference Eastern Division 
and advance to a de facto national semiﬁ  nal 
in the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta on Dec. 1.
  Put simply, Saturday’s game is a big 
deal.
  But UF coach Will Muschamp and his 
players aren’t giving off that vibe. Florida would 
have you believe its preparation meth-
ods for Bowling 
Green and Georgia are identical. For the Gators, every team 
on the schedule is 
full of nameless, 
faceless players.
  “Nothing’s changed for us,” Muschamp 
said. “We’re not working any longer, hard-er. Practice, it’s all the same. We don’t ap-
proach things differently based on the situ-
ation because next week’s important, too.”
  Granted, staying the course and keeping 
an even keel is smart. 
Florida’s steady approach has worked to 
perfection so far this season. Call Florida-Georgia what it is: 
The biggest game of the year

Until Sunday, Lauren Smith 
had never played center back in 
her life.
But with starter Annie Bob-
bitt out with a knee sprain and the Gators up 4-0 on Vanderbilt, coach Becky Burleigh decided to 
try Smith at the position.
“I kind of had to second take,” 
Smith said. “I didn’t know if she 
was talking to me. I was pretty shocked.”
Said Burleigh: “She did a really 
remarkable job, considering she had never played there before.”
Due to injuries to Bobbitt and 
All-America redshirt senior Kat Williamson, little-used players such as Smith will likely get a ma-jority of the minutes at center back when Florida plays South Caro-
lina on Thursday. A win for the 
Gators clinches the Southeastern Conference regular-season title.
Florida’s woes at center back 
began when Williamson left the team’s match against Florida In-ternational with a torn right me-niscus on Sept. 2.
Before suffering her injury, 
Williamson had started 78 games in her career at Florida.
Following Williamson’s in-
jury, the bulk of her playing time 
fell to Bobbitt, who has made 10 
starts this year. Bobbitt left due to injury after playing 22 minutes in the Gators’ loss to Alabama on Friday.
“A lot of communication that 
Bobbitt offers is going to be a big loss for us,” goalkeeper Taylor Burke said. 
With Bobbitt out, Burleigh said 
she will likely play a mix of play-ers alongside freshman Christen Westphal on the back line. West-phal has started all but one game 
this season.
Against the Commodores on 
Sunday, sophomore Karina Guts-che started in Bobbitt’s place. She was one of only two players who 
played more than 70 minutes in the blowout victory.
“Karina is a beast on defense,” 
Burleigh said. 
“She takes it personally, and 
she goes hard on every tackle. I would not want to play against her.”
Gutsche has played in 10 of the 
Gators’ 18 games this year, but has 
made only three starts. She missed 
time early in the season after suf-fering a concussion when a ball deflected off the crossbar and hit her in the head during practice.
Like Smith, Gutsche is listed as 
a midfielder on Florida’s roster. But, unlike Smith, Gutsche has ex-perience at center back.
“I’ve played it in practice, and 
our practices are very game-like,” Gutsche said. “It wasn’t very much of an adjustment.”
Luckily for Florida, reinforce-
ments may soon be on the way. 
Burleigh said Bobbitt’s sprain was 
minor, and she could be back soon if her swelling and range of mo-tion improve. Burleigh also said 
the Gators could be receiving an 
All-America boost in the near fu-ture.
“We’re hoping to have [Wil-
liamson] for postseason, for sure,” 
Burleigh said. “It’s just a matter of 
when.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2012

The Isleworth Country Club is notorious for being one of the 
country’s most difficult courses.
It lived up to its reputation at the Isleworth Collegiate Invita-
tional in Windermere. 
No. 6 Florida shot a 22-over 886 in the three-round tourna-
ment to finish sixth overall. 
“It was a disappointing way to end a golf season,” coach 
Buddy Alexander said. “It is a little disappointing after such a 
great semester.”
UF will retake the course for the spring season on Feb. 9 at 
the Gator Invitational.
Florida started its fall season with three consecutive top-
two finishes — including a team win at The Invitational at The Ocean Course on Sept. 9-11 — but couldn’t continue the streak at the Islesworth despite shooting a tournament-low 286 (-2) in the second round.  
The Gators entered the final round on 
Tuesday in a tie for third place with defend-ing national champion Texas, carding a 583 (+7) through two rounds of play. Despite the efforts of T.J. Vogel, Tyler McCumber and J.D. 
Tomlinson in the second round — all three 
finished at or under par —  UF failed to keep 
the momentum on the last day. 
Florida tallied a 303 (+15) on Tuesday, 
marking its worst round of the tournament.  
Vogel shot a team-low 74 (+2) on the par-72, 7,544-yard 
course, bringing his total to 218 (+2) for the tournament. He fin-ished tied for sixth with UCF’s Greg Eason and Augusta State’s 
Derek Chang. The Isleworth Invitational marked Vogel’s fourth 
consecutive top-10 finish.
Senior McCumber and freshman A.J. Crouch both posted a 
77 (+5). McCumber entered the day in a three-way tie for second 
but finished in a tie for ninth with a 219 (+3) total. 
Crouch carded a 233 (+17) to finish tied for 60th. 
Tomlinson, a sophomore, concluded the invite with a 75 (+3), 
bringing his tourney total to 221 (+5). The Gainesville native fin-
ished tied for 21st. 
Rounding out the Gators’ lineup was senior Tommy Mou, 
who finished the third round in 80 strokes (+8). Mou ended his 
second tournament of the fall season with a 231 (+15). 
Alexander believes the time off between the fall and spring 
seasons will give the Gators a chance to improve. 
“Hopefully, this will give our team the motivation to work 
hard in the offseason to get ready for the spring.”UF golf ends fall with

 UF coachbecause I don’t think that’s a good conclusion to what the total 
outcome was.” 
Georgia end presents stiff test: Jarvis Jones had a scary Hal-
loween three years ago.
As a backup linebacker for USC, Jones suffered a sprained 
neck against Oregon in 2009 and missed the season’s final five games.  
Lane Kiffin, who began coaching the Trojans the following 
spring, called it a career-threatening injury.
So ended the outside linebacker’s time at USC.Two seasons later, he squared off against Pease and Boise 
State with Georgia in its 2011 season opener.
“Going in, I don’t think we knew enough about him,” Pease 
said. “We knew he transferred, knew he was probably a good player, but after going against him and just watching how fast he played the game, the strength he played with, how they used him, he is definitely an impact player.”
Jones earned first-team All-America honors and was second 
in the nation with 13.5 sacks in 2011. He recorded a career-high four sacks against Florida last season.
For the Gators’ offensive line, competing against a sack ma-
chine like Jones isn’t anything new.
Florida faced LSU’s duo of Sam Montgomery and Barkevi-
ous Mingo on Oct. 6 before squaring off with South Carolina’s Jadeveon Clowney on Saturday.
Jones has 5.5 sacks this season.“They’re great players,” Pease said. “Understanding what 
we’ve got to do schematically, that helps us knowing how we eventually got to some things that were successful for us han-dling that type of pass rusher.” 
Jones missed Georgia’s game against Kentucky last week 
due to a sprained ankle suffered against South Carolina on Oct. 6.
He returned to practice on Monday.
Pease no stranger to rivalries: Pease isn’t a fan of the Bobcats.
He started at quarterback for Montana from 1985-1986 and 
then served eight years on the Grizzlies’ offensive coaching staff from 1991-1998.
Every year except one, Pease came out victorious in the 
Brawl of the Wild. 
The annual matchup between Montana and Montana State 
is referred to as the Griz-Cat Rivalry by Montana fans.
“We don’t call them Montana State,” Pease said. “We call 
them the other team. Don’t ever say Montana State.”
Come Saturday, Pease will coach his first Florida-Georgia game. 
The two SEC rivals won’t exchange pleasantries in Jackson-
ville. 
“Is it nasty? I mean, I wouldn’t say it’s nasty,” UF defensive 
end Dominique Easley said about the rivalry. “I mean, I don’t like them. They Georgia, that’s all. They Bulldogs, that’s all.”
Pease noticed a change in the Gators during the first couple 
days of practice this week. Preparation hasn’t been an issue through the first seven games this season, and the players told Pease they don’t need any extra motivation to get ready for the Bulldogs.
“It’s magnitude of the game — I’m learning that,” Pease 
said. “I’ve never been a part of the Florida-Georgia game be-fore, but I’m understanding what it’s about.”

However, treating the Bulldogs as sim-
ply another opponent is just downright 
silly.
C’mon! Show a little leg! Where’s the 
bravado?
The rivalry is called the World’s Largest 
Outdoor Cocktail Party, and the Gators are 
sitting quietly in the corner sipping sweet 
tea. Wake up!
The final score be damned, Georgia an-
nihilated Florida last season.
The Bulldogs had 23 first downs com-
pared to the Gators’ 11. 
UGA gained 185 yards in the ground 
game, and UF lost 19. 
Perhaps most disturbing for the Gators: 
The Bulldogs snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Georgia erased a 17-3 Flor -
ida lead by scoring two touchdowns on fourth down.
The Bulldogs offense controlled the 
second half, amassing nearly 21 minutes of possession after halftime, including the game’s final 5:32.
Meanwhile, the Gators’ offense could 
not gain any traction in the second half, re-cording just one first down in the final 30 
minutes.
“We felt like it was a game we let slip 
away,” Muschamp said.
The beatdown Georgia administered to 
Florida last season should embarrass the Gators even more than the Bulldogs’ team-
wide touchdown celebration five years ago.
Georgia slowly and methodically 
crushed Florida’s spirit, emphatically ham-mering the final nail into the coffin that was UF’s winless October.
The Gators should be angry, hurting 
from last season’s humiliation. Instead, 
they label Saturday’s game a rivalry and 
carry on.
“I don’t want to say revenge,” Jeff 
Driskel said. “We’re just going to go out 
there and play hard and practice hard, you 
know, work hard this week.”
Maybe Muschamp is pumping up this 
game to his players behind closed doors. Perhaps the “nameless, faceless” mantra is 
merely an act to avoid a sparring war with 
Georgia coach Mark Richt, who has been brash in the media regarding Florida in the past.
The Gators’ showdown with the Bull-
dogs on Saturday is the most important game of the season not because it’s the next one, but because of what it represents.
Just like every year, reaching Atlanta 
has been Florida’s end game since the sea-son began. 
Saturday’s contest is the culmination of 
that journey.
Beating Georgia means more than just 
another win, and the Gators should act like it.

� FLORIDA WILL PLAY 
FLORIDA STATE TONIGHT AT 6 IN TALLAHASSEE. JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
Middle blockers Betsy Smith 
and Chloe Mann have always an-
chored the front-line defense for 
No. 11 Florida, which faces No. 12 Florida State today at 6 p.m. in Tal-
lahassee. 
But after Smith recorded a ca-
reer-high 15 kills on Sunday and Mann won the Southeastern Con-
ference Offensive Player of the Week award, Wise said the duo is 
a force to be reckoned with offen-
sively as well.
Mann leads the team with 3.87 
kills per set, while Smith ranks fourth with 1.98 per set. Mann’s .439 hitting percentage is the best 
on the Gators, while Smith’s .363 
ranks third.  
At first, Wise struggled to recall 
a time when Florida had a pair of high-scoring middles as strong as 
Smith and Mann. 
“You’d have to go back some,” 
Wise said. 
“Before Benavia Jenkins got 
hurt, she and Sherri Williams were 
pretty efficient in the middle as 
well.”
Jenkins and Williams last 
played together in 2003, which was the first and last time the Gators 
appeared in a national champion-ship game.
Wise said this year’s team has 
leaned on the middles in the same way Florida did nearly 10 years 
ago. 
Smith and Mann have respond-
ed by leading the Gators to a 14-game winning streak, which has 
included eight sweeps and two 2-0 comebacks against SEC oppo-
nents.
“They are the X-factor for our 
team right now,” Wise said. “Chloe Mann is having an amazing season 
and just seems to get better and better — Betsy as well. I think the 
team feeds off of her leadership and emotional energy.”
The SEC named Mann, a junior, 
the Offensive Player of the Week 
after she led the Gators with 32 
kills last weekend against Alabama 
and Texas A&M. 
She committed only two attack-
ing errors, giving her a .566 hitting clip.
Smith, a redshirt senior, not 
only accumulated a career-high in kills during the comeback victory against the Aggies, but she was 
also the spark the Gators needed 
in the locker room following the second set.
“When I went into the locker 
room, I waited until [Smith] was finished addressing the team be-
fore I talked to them,” Wise said. 
“It’s not surprising that would be her career high.”
When asked where the two 
middles stack up against the na-tion’s top duos, Wise said she 
wouldn’t know. But she did know 
one thing.
“Those two have been stellar,” 
she said.Middles provide offensive boost
